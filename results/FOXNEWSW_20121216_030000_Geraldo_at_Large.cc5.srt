CHILDREN AND THE WOMEN WHO

267
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000

270
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000

HE PURPOSELY PARTICIPATED.

274
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
IN SEVEN OF THOSE EXAMS.

275
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
OF THOSE HE SAID THE WOUNDS

276
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
WERE THREE TO 11 WOUNDS ON

277
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000

M-4.
STUCK IT UP TO THE CHILDREN

282
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
AND THEN HIT THEM EACH 3 TO 11

283
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
TIMES.
>> THAT'S THE MEDICAL

284
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
EXAMINER'S ASSESSMENT.
HE SAID THIS IS WHAT THESE

285
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
CHILDREN HAVE SUFFERED.

286
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT

287
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
CLOSE-UP WOUNDS NOT EVERYONE

288
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
HAS SUFFERED THE CLOSE-UP

289
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
WOUNDS.

290
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
THEY WEREN'T PARTICULARLY A
QUICK THING THAT HAPPENED

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
AROUND HIS ROOM.

292
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
20 CHILDREN, ALL OF THEM.

293
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
EACH WITH ALL OF THESE

294
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
DIFFERENT BULLET WOUNDS.

295
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
HE SAID IT WAS A LONG RIFLE

296
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
THAT WAS USED.

297
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
THAT DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR SOME

298
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
OF THE OTHER WEAPONS THAT WE

299
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
ALSO HEARD MAY HAVE BEEN FOUND

300
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

301
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN

302
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
WORKING TO CLEAR UP THAT HOW

303
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
MANY WEAPONS WERE THERE?

304
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
SOME OF THE WEAPONS AT LEAST

305
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
TO THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER.

306
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
THAT'S ALL COMING INTO

307
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
CLARITY.

308
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
>> CLEAR NOW THAT THE MAIN

309
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
MURDERING WEAPON WAS THE

310
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
ASSAULT RIFLE?

311
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
>> EXACTLY.
THAT'S WHAT THE MEDICINE CALL

312
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
EXAMINER SAID SAID TODAY HE

313
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
BELIEVES IT WAS A LONG RIFLE.

314
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
THAT LEAVES OTHER QUESTIONS AS

315
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
TO WHAT WERE THESE GUNS DOING

316
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
AND THE GUNS AT THE HOME AS

317
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
WELL.
>> STILL NO WORD ON MOTIVE.

318
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
>> NO WORD ON MOTIVE.

319
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
AUTHORITIES SAID THERE IS SOME

320
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
EVIDENCE.
THEY AREN'T SAYING WHAT OR

321
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
GIVE THEM DETAILS THAT WILL

322
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
LEAD THEM TO THE HOW AND WHY.

323
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
THEY THINK THEY ARE ON THE

324
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
RIGHT PATH OF GETTING SOME

325
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
INFORMATION ALONG THOSE LINES.

326
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
ALL.

330

>> SO WE ARE LEFT TO PONDER

331
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
WHY THIS PERSON COULD BE THE

332
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
DEVIL'S SPAWN.
WHY THIS PERSON COULD BECOME

SO EVIL, SO WICKED, SO

334
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
DEPRAVED AS TO TAKE THESE

335
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
LIVES.
>> ANY ANSWER OF WHY STILL

336
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
WOULDN'T EXPLAIN THE

337
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000

HAPPENED TO OUR CHILDREN.

THEY WERE VERY LITTLE.
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT'S

HARD AND I GRIEVE FOR THEIR

353

>> DID YOU, I UNDERSTAND,

557
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
DURING THE EVENT YOU KNEW

558
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING.

559
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
WHAT DID YOU HEAR.
>> I HEARD SHOTS.

560
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
MY BROTHER CALLED ME ON THE

561
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
PHONE AND ASKED IF THE POLICE

562
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
WERE AT MY HOUSE.

563
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I SAID WHY WOULD THEY BE AT

564
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
THE HOUSE?

565
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
THEY SAID THERE WAS A

566
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
SHOOTING.
I HAD HEARD THE SIRENS, I WAS

567
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
GOING TO CALL MY FATHER.

568
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I DIDN'T AND ONCE I REALIZED

569
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
WHAT HAPPENED, I RAN ACROSS

570
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
THE STREET TO THE SCHOOL I SAW

571
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
MY CERTAIN WITH MY NEPHEW.

572
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I KNEW HE WAS SAFE.

573
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
>> AND, YET, THE CRUELTY IS

574
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
SOME PARENTS WERE ELATED AND

575
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
RELIEVED AND OTHER PARENTS ARE

576
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
CRUSHED AND SCARED.

577
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I MEAN, HOW WILL THIS

578
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
COMMUNITY DEAL WITH THAT?

579
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
THAT'S WHAT MY BROTHER IS

580
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
GOING THROUGH.
LIKE CHRISTMAS DAY FOR HIM AND

581
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
HELL FOR OTHERS.

582
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'M EXTREMELY EXCITED AND

583
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
HAPPY WITH MY NEPHEW'S WELL

584
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
BEING, THERE WERE PARENTS THAT

585
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
DON'T HAVE THAT SAME FORTUNE.

586
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
AND IT TEARS OUR HEART APART

587
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
TO HAVE TO EVEN THINK ABOUT

588
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
THAT CLOSE SO CLOSE TO

589
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
CHRISTMAS.

590
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
IT RIPS AT MY HEART.

591
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I CAN'T SAY IT ANY MORE THAN

592
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
THAT.

593
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
ELATED.

594
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
FAMILY GOING THROUGH A LOT

595
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
RIGHT NOW.
THEY WILL BE GETTING

596
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
COUNSELING FOR THEIR SON

597
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
BECAUSE POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS,

598
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
THOSE THINGS THAT COME TO

599
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
PLAY.

600
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
THEY WILL PULL TOGETHER LIKE

601
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
THIS COMMUNITY.
THIS IS ONE HECK OF A TOWN

602
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
THIEVES THESE PEOPLE ARE

603
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
GREAT.
THE FIBER OF THIS COMMUNITY

604
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
WAS WOKEN UP BY THE DEVIL

605
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
HIMSELF.
THIS TOWN WILL RISE UP AGAIN.

606
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
IT HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO.

607
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
THESE PEOPLE STICK TOGETHER.

608
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
>> I HEARD ONE OF THE VICTIMS

609
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
WAS AN ANGEL IN THE CHRISTMAS

610
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
PAGEANT THAT ONE OF THE

611
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
CHURCHES DOWNTOWN.

612
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
ALL OF HAVING VARIOUS

613
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
MEMORIALS.

614
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
YOU WORKED IN HOSPICE CARE.

615
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
IT'S ALMOST IF THIS WHOLE TOWN

616
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
NEEDS HOSPICE CARE.

617
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
>> IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE

618
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
HOSPICE CARE USUALLY INVOLVES

619
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING AT OLD

620
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
AGE.

621
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I WRKD WITH THEM WHEN I WAS 12

622
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
YEARS OLD.

623
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
DIFFERENT WORKING WITH PARENTS

624
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
WHOSE CHILD ISN'T SUPPOSED TO

625
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
BE DEAD.

626
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
FAMILIES WHOSE CHILD ISN'T

627
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD.

628
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
IT'S NOT NATURAL.

629
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
IT'S NOT NATURAL.

630
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS

631
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
INCIDENT SO MUCH DIFFERENT

632
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
THAN ANY OTHER HOSPICE

633
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
INCIDENT OR LOSING A LOVED ONE

634
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
FOR CANCER, YOU KNOW, AT AN

635
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
OLD AGE.

636
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
BUT THE DEBATE DEFINITELY

637
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
NEEDS TO INCORPORATE THAT.

638
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I THINK OBAMA IS RIGHT ON

639
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
THAT.

640
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
IT'S NOT A BIPARTISAN ISSUE.

641
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
>> Geraldo: GET BACK TO 9/11.

642
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
POINT THAT MORE CHILDREN DIED

643
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
HERE TODAY OR FRIDAY THAN DIED

644
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
IN THE 9/11 ATTACKS.

645
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
THE CHILDREN FEWER THAN DIED

646
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
ON THE AIRCRAFT.
>> WHEN I HEARD THIS

647
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
YESTERDAY.
IT KEPT MIRRORING WHAT I SAW

648
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
PALM SUNDAY WITH THE 10 KIDS

649
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
BEING SHOT IN THE HEAD.

650
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
THIS IS MORE PERSONAL THAN

651
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
9/11.

652
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
THAT WAS CRAZY.

653
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL MISHAP ABOUT

654
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
RELIGION.
HERE COULDN'T BE A MOTIVE NO

655
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
MOTIVE IN THE WORLD THAT CAN
MAKE AN EXCUSE FOR THESE POOR

656
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
LITTLE CHILDREN.

657
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
6-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN COWERING

658
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
TOGETHER THIS PUNK GOING IN
THERE AND CONTINUOUSLY

659
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
SHOOTING THESE KIDS.

660
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
THIS CAN'T BE A MOTIVE.

661
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
WHEN THEY FIND OUT WHAT MADE

662
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
THIS GUY DO, THIS I WANT TO

663
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
KNOW AND I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE

664
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
IT COULD BE ANY MOTIVE.

665
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
>> Geraldo: YOU CAN'T.

666
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
DEVIL INCARNATE.
EAT GOOD FATS.

667
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
AVOID BAD.

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
DON'T GO OVER 2000...

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
1200 CALORIES A DAY.

670
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
CARBS ARE BAD. CARBS ARE GOOD.

671
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
THE STORY KEEPS CHANGING.

672
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
SO I'M NOT LISTENING...

673
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000

MORE PROCESSED FLAKES LOOK
NOTHING LIKE NATURALRAINS.

679
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH
NUTRITION YOU CAN SEE.

680
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
GREAT GRAINS.

681
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
SCHOOLING HIM.

741
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
SHE BATTLED THE SCHOOL

742
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
DISTRICT.
I'M NOT 100% CERTAIN IF IT WAS

743
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
BEHAVIOR OR LEARNING

744
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
DISABILITY, I REALLY DON'T

745
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
KNOW.
IS HE A VERY VERY BRIGHT BOY.

746
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
HE WAS SMART.

747
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

748
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
NEPHEW SHE CALLS A BRIGHT BOY.

749
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
A YOUNG MAN WHO BECAME A

750
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
MONSTER, WHO COMMITTED A

751
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
MONSTROUS ACT SMALL

752
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
PICTURESQUE CONNECTICUT TOWN

753
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
FOREVER MORE WILL BE

754
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
ASSOCIATED NOW SADLY WITH THE

755
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
MASSACRE OF THE LITTLE FIRST

756
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
GRADE KID.
THEIR PRINCIPAL, THEIR SCHOOL

757
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
PSYCHOLOGIST AND OTHER ADULTS

758
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
TRYING TO PROTECT THOSE

759
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
CHILDREN ALL SLAUGHTERED BY

760
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
THAT YOUNG MAN TURNED MONSTER

761
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
ADAM LANZA.

762
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
MIKE TOBIN IS NEAR THE HOME

763
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THE 20-YEAR-OLD SHARED WITH

764
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
HIS MOTHER NANCY WHO WAS THE

765
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
FIRST TO FALL FROM ORGY OF

766
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
VIOLENCE.
TELL US FIRST OF ALL, SINGLE

767
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
MOM, DIVORCED, TELL US A

768
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
LITTLE BIT.

769
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
>> THEY WERE DIVORCED IN 2009

770
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
AFTER 17 YEARS OF MARRIAGE

771
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
THIS MAY VERY WELL END UP

772
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
PLAYING A ROLE.

773
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
INDICATIONS THAT BOTH OF THE

774
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
SONS WERE TRAUMA ADVERTISED BY

775
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
THIS DIVORCE.

776
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
AND YOU HAD RYAN, THE OLDER

777
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
SON GO OFF TO THE UNIVERSITY.

778
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
AND THEN ADAM WAS LEFT ALONE

779
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
IN THE HOUSE WITHOUT HIS

780
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
BROTHER, WITHOUT HIS FATHER.

781
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
AND APPARENTLY WITHOUT A LOT

782
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
OF CONTACT WITH HIS FATHER.

783
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
NOT A BAD HOME BUT PRETTY

784
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
ROUGH ON THE TWO SONS ONCE

785
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
THAT FAMILY SPLIT UP.

786
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
>> MIKE, WHAT ABOUT THIS

787
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
NOTION THAT THE MOTHER WAS A

788
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
SURVIVALIST?

789
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
THAT'S WHY SHE HAD ALL THESE

790
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
WEAPONS INCLUDING THE 223 BUSH

791
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
MASTER A WEAPON WHO ARE SUITED

792
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
FOR WAR THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

793
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
WALLS SHE A SURVIVALIST?

794
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
>> WHAT WE ARE HEARING MORAL

795
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
IS THAT SHE HAD THE GUNS

796
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
BECAUSE SHE LIVED IN THAT BIG

797
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
HOUSE PRACTICALLY BY HERSELF.

798
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
SHE WAS THERE WITH THE ONE SON

799
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
AS WE TALKED ABOUT

800
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS.

801
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
THAT'S WHY SHE HAD THE GUN.

802
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
SHE WAS PROUD OF HER GUN

803
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
COLLECTION.

804
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
RESTAURANT BAR HERE LOCALLY
THAT SHE WOULD -- I WOULDN'T

805
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
SAY FREQUENT.

806
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
WASN'T A BIG DRINKER.

807
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
SHE WOULD GO IN FROM TIME TO

808
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
TIME AND SHE WOULD BOAST ABOUT

809
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
HER GUN COLLECTION.

810
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
SHE WAS QUITE PROUD THROUGH

811
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
SOME THE REPORTING THROUGH
REUTERS THAT A LANDSCAPER CAME

812
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
THROUGH THERE AND SHE HAD

813
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
SHOWED HIM SOME OF THE GUNS

814
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
AND TALKED WITH HIM ABOUT HOW

815
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
OFTEN SHE WOULD TAKE THE KID

816
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
OUT SHOOTING, GERALDO.

817
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
>> Geraldo: YOU MENTIONED THE

818
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDER ALLEGED

819
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
THIS 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA

820
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
HAD.
WAS HE?

821
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
WAS HE NOT AUTISTIC?

822
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
IS THAT CONFIRMED?

823
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
>> IT ISN'T CONFIRMED.

824
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
CERTAINLY NOT THROUGH THE

825
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
STATE POLICE.

826
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
WE HAVE HEARD MENTION OF AS

827
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
BERGER SYNDROME A FORM OF

828
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
AUTISM.
THAT REALLY GETS TRACED BACK

829
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
TO THE OLDER BROTHER RYAN

830
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
REPORTEDLY WHAT HE SAID TO THE

831
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
POLICE.
OTHER THAN THAT A LOT OF

832
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
PEOPLE KNEW HIM AND SOMETHING

833
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
GOING ON WITH THAT CHILD --

834
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
THAT YOUNG MAN WHO IS INVOLVED

835
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
IN THIS TERRIBLE TERRIBLE ACT

836
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
THAT HE WAS VERY WITHDRAWN.

837
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
SOMETIMES HE WOULD WITHDRAW TO
THE POINT WHERE HE WAS NO

838
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
LONGER FUNCTIONAL IN SCHOOL.

839
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
HE HAD PROBLEMS WITH SCHOOL.

840
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
PEOPLE WOULD SEE HIM IN THE

841
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
HALLWAYS.

842
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
HE WOULDN'T MAKE EYE CONTACT.

843
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
HE WOULD PULL BACK AND CLUTCH

844
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
HIS BRIEFCASE HE WOULD CARRY

845
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
WITH HILL.
HIS OLDER BROTHER HAD

846
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
DESCRIBED HIM AS A NERD

847
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
BECAUSE THE INTERESTING THING

848
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
IS HE HE WAS BRILLIANT WITH

849
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
COMPUTERS.

850
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
HE WAS KIND OF SLIGHT OF

851
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
BUILD, WALKED AROUND WITH A

852
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
POCKET PROTECTER AND THAT'S

853
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
WHERE YOU GET THAT KIND OF

854
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
LABEL AND HE CERTAINLY HAD

855
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
SOME SOCIAL PROBLEMS AT THE

856
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
SAME TIME.

857
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
HE DID HAVE GIFTS IN TERMS OF

858
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
WORKING WITH COMPUTERS.

859
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
>> Geraldo: MIKE, THANKS.

860
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
DR. KEITH ABLOW JOINS US NOW.

861
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
DR. KEITH IS AS YOU KNOW ON

862
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
THE FOX NEWS MEDICAL A TEAM.

863
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
SO, DR. ABLOW, WHAT ABOUT --

864
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
FIRST OF ALL, I NEVER HEARD OF

865
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
AUTISM OR AS BERGERES BEING

866
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
ASSOCIATED WITH VIOLENCE.

867
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
ARE WE SLANDERING THOSE WHO

868
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
HAVE THIS DEVELOPMENTAL

869
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
DISABILITY?

870
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
USING IT IN THIS CONTEXT.

871
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
>> GERALDO, BY AND LARGE AS

872
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
BERGER'S SYNDROME AND AUTISM

873
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

874
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
HORRIFIC ACTS OF VIOLENCE.

875
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
THESE KIDS CAN BE

876
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
SELF-ABUSIVE.

877
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
THEY CAN BE VIOLENT AT TIMES

878
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
THE KIND HE METHODICAL

879
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
PLANNING INVOLVED HERE.

880
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
THE VIOLENT USE OF WEAPONS,

881
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
THE ABILITY TO TAKE THESE

882
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
THINGS FROM HIS MOTHER TO KILL

883
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
HIS MOTHER TO SAMINGLY PLAN

884
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
THEM IS NOT TYPICAL OF THAT

885
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
AND THERE HAS TO BE SOME

886
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
EXPLANATION OTHER THAN THOSE

887
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
DIAGNOSES.

888
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
SO, IN THAT WAY, YES, WE ARE

889
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
DOING A DISSERVICE BECAUSE

890
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHAT

891
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
HAPPENED HERE.
IT'S ANOTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL OR

892
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER OR SET OF

893
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
SYMPTOMS.

894
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
>> I KNOW A LOT OF GUN

895
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
COLLECTORS THEY USUALLY DON'T

896
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
COLLECT WEAPONS BIKE THE BUSH

897
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
MASTER THE GLOCK, THE SIG SO

898
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
YOUIER.

899
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
THESE WEAPONS ARE WEAPONS OF

900
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
SEVERE VIOLENCE.
THESE ARE AGGRESSIVE WEAPONS,

901
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
PARTICULARLY THE CIVILIAN

902
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
VERSION OF THE M-4.

903
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?

904
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
IF SHE WASN'T A SURVIVALIST,

905
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
WHAT WAS SHE.
>> IT'S HARD TO SAY RIGHT NOW

906
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
BECAUSE WE NEED MORE

907
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
INFORMATION.
AND PEOPLE CAN COLLECT ANY

908
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
GUNS THEY WANT.

909
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
SHE MAY HAVE HAD ALL KINDS OF

910
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
REASONS FOR WANTING THOSE

911
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
AROUND.

912
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
WHY SHE WOULD GIVE HER SON

913
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
ACCESS TO THEM AND NOT HAVE

914
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
THEM LOCKED UP WHEN IS HE A

915
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
TROUBLED YOUNG MAN AND SHE

916
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
KNOWS THAT HE IS WITHDRAWN AND

917
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
HAS SEVERE DIFFICULTIES,

918
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION.

919
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
THAT DOESN'T REALLY SPEAK YOU

920
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
THINK YOU WOULD WANT TO

921
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
SAFEGUARD THOSE THINGS FROM AN

922
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
AEMOTIONALLY DISTURBED YOUNG

923
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
MAN.
DID YOU GET HIM THE HELP IN

924
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000

951
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
WE SHOULD PROTECT OUR CHILDREN

952
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
WITH THE SAME VIGOR WE PROTECT

00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000

THE KIDS WILL GET USED TO THE

957
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000

IT WILL BE LIKE OFFICER CRUMP

1106
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
>> IT'S VERY SAD THAT

1107
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
HAPPENED.
>> THE PERPETRATOR AN

1108
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
18-YEAR-OLD STUDENT WHO POLICE

1109
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
SAY WAS FREQUENTLY BULLIED BUT

1110
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
WHO OFFICIALS DESCRIBE AS A

1111
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
MILITANT RADICAL.

1112
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
>> THE PRELIMINARY ANNUAL CYST

1113
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
WHICH WE HAD OF THE OFFENDER

1114
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
IS THAT HE IS QUITE A LONELY

1115
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
PERSON.
HE HAS A GREAT SOCIETY.

1116
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
AND OUT OF EXTREME OPINIONS

1117
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
AND RADICAL THOUGHTS.

1118
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
>> ALVIN THEN POSTS A PHOTO OF

1119
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
HIMSELF ON YOUTUBE HOLDING A

1120
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
GUN ON ONE HAND AND WEARING A

1121
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
T-SHIRT THAT READS:  HUMANITY

1122
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
IS OVERRATED.

1123
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO

1124
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
NEWTOWN.
>> WE WERE JUST IN THE MIDDLE

1125
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
OF GYM WHEN WE HEARD SOME

1126
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
GUNSHOTS AND THEN THE PAIR

1127
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
WENT OUT AND THE GYM TEACHERS

1128
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
DIRECTED US TO STAY AGAINST

1129
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
THE WALL AND EVERYBODY STARTED

1130
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
KIND OF PANICKING.

1131
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
WE HEARD A LOT MORE GUNSHOTS

1132
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
AND THE AMBULANCE CAME.

1133
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
THEN THE POLICEMAN DIRECTED US

1134
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
TO RUN OUT OF THE BUILDING AND

1135
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
GO TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

1136
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
>> THE COLUMBINE MASSACRE IN

1137
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
1999 MADE US ALL UNDERSTAND

1138
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE NO LONGER

1139
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
SAFE HAVENS.

1140
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
BETH LOST HER DAUGHTER RACHEL.

1141
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
SHE JOINS ME ON THE PHONE FROM

1142
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
COLORADO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, BETH, FOR

1143
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
BEING WITH US.

1144
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
>> HOW DO YOU EVER HEAL FROM

1145
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

1146
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
>> IT TAKES A LONG LONG TIME.

1147
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I DESCRIBED IT AS BEING HIT BY

1148
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
A FREIGHT TRAIN AND YOU DON'T

1149
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
EVEN KNOW HOW HARD YOU HAVE

1150
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
BEEN HIT.

1151
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
AND FOR YEARS YOU CAN WALK

1152
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
AROUND WITH THE PAIN AND

1153
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
BROKENNESS OF THAT.

1154
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
AND BUT, YOU KNOW, IT COMES

1155
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
AND GOES.

1156
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
AND FOR US, IT WAS A VERY LONG

1157
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
HEALING PROCESS.

1158
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
BUT WE DID ACTUALLY BECOME

1159
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
STRONGER FOR IT.

1160
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
AND SOME GOOD THINGS HAVE COME

1161
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
OUT OF IT.

1162
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
AND ALL THE TALK ABOUT EVIL,

1163
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
EVIL SHOWED ITS FACE THAT DAY

1164
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY IT

1165
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
DIDN'T WIN BECAUSE OUT OF

1166
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
LOSING RACHEL, WE ALSO GAINED

1167
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
A PLATFORM FOR MUCH GOOD.

1168
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
FIRST OF ALL FOR OUR FAITH,

1169
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
WHICH SUSTAINED US DURING THIS

1170
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
TIME AND ALSO FOR PROGRAMS AND

1171
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
A LOT OF SPEAKING REGARDING

1172
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
COMPASSION AND KINDNESS AND

1173
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF

1174
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
SCHOOLS AND CHURCHES AND YOUTH

1175
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
PROGRAMS TO DO THAT AND THAT

1176
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
BROUGHT SOME HEALING.

1177
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
BUT IT IS A VERY LONG LONG

1178
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
PROCESS.

1179
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
THERE IS A LIGHT AT THE END OF

1180
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
THE TUNNEL, BUT THE PARENTS

1181
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
THAT ARE THERE RIGHT NOW,

1182
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
THERE IS NO WAY THAT THEY CAN

1183
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
EVEN SEE A GLIMMER OF HOPE

1184
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
BECAUSE OVERWOMENNING DESPAIR

1185
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
OF THEIR LOSS.

1186
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
AND MY HEART IS VERY HEAVY FOR

1187
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
THEM BECAUSE I KNOW THE ROAD

1188
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO TRAVEL

1189
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
FOR MANY MONTHS AND YEARS IS

1190
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
GOING TO BE VERY HARD AND

1191
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
DIFFICULT ROAD I BELIEVE THEY

1192
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
WILL MAKE IT AND I BELIEVE THE

1193
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
COMMUNITY HAS ALSO SHOWN

1194
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
ITSELF TO BE STROCK AND

1195
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
RESILIENT.
AND ONE THAT WILL.

1196
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
>> STRONG AND RESILIENT?

1197
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
>> YES.
>> IT'S A VERY BIG BURDEN.

1198
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE,

1199
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
RACHEL.

1200
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
THE AUDIO ON YOUR PHONE CALL A

1201
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
LITTLE MUDDLED.

1202
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I WISH YOU THE BEST AND I

1203
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
CALLED YOU RACHEL.

1204
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
BETH, I WISH YOU THE BEST.

1205
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
OUR CONDOLENCES FOR THE LOSS

1206
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
OF YOUR RACHEL IN 1999.

WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN NEWTOWN,

1215
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
CONNECTICUT WAS A GODLESS ACT,

1216

REGARDLESS OF YOUR RELIGION,

1217
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000

It's not an upgrade
to your phone.

1230
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
It's an upgrade to yourself.

WE FUNCTION AS A SOCIETY.

1247
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
RIGHT?
I USED TO WALK INTO AN AIRPORT

00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
AND 20 MINUTES BEFORE A FLIGHT

1249
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
AND GO ON.

1250
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
THIS PAST THURSDAY I HAD TO GO

1251
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
TO FEDERAL COURT.

1252
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I'M A LAWYER.

I HAD TO TAKE EVERYTHING OFF.

ACTS OF ONE LUNATIC THAT

HOPEFULLY THIS IS SOMETHING

1266
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
THAT WILL HAPPEN FIRST IN A

1267

THERE IS NO CRIME OTHER THAN

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
DAY WAITING OUTSIDE THE

ARTHUR IS WRONG WOULD THEY

00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HAD SOMEONE

1280
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
ARMED IN THAT SCHOOL THAT

1281
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
COULD HAVE STOPPED THIS CREEP

1282
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
FROM KILLING ALL THESE KIDS?

1283
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
>> ONE CHILD, BUT WHAT I'M

1284
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
SAYING IS YOU DO AN EFFECTIVE

1285
