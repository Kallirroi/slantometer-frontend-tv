WE HAVE ANOTHER SERIES OF STORMS

382
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
THAT WILL CAUSE SOME ADDITIONAL

383
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
CONCERN THERE.

384

STARVED THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE

388
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
WHAT WE HAD LATELY.

389
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
ANY TIME WE HAVE STORMS COMING

390
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000

397
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
BEING LIT FROM THE LIGHTS INTO

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
MADE IT OVER TO THE EAST BAY

403
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
SO FAR NO RAIN MAKING IT TO THE

409
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000

410
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
SEE AUTO OVER THE OCEAN THAT

411
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
PROBABLY HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF

412
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
ACTUALLY REACHING THE GROUND.

413
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
THAT WILL BE THE CASE WITH THIS

414
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
STORM.
IT'S SHIFTING OVER THE OCEAN IT

416
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
