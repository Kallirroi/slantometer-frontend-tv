THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO
FOCUS ON.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
THIS DEBATE IS ABOUT GUN

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
CONTROL.
IT'S ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
IT'S A COMBINATION.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
IT'S GOT TO BE ALL GROUPS THAT

CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE, WE

25
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
HAVE TO START DOING THINGS IN

26
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
AMERICA.

27
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
>> ONE OF THE COPS SAID IT'S THE

204
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
WORST THING HE HAD EVER SEEN IN

205
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
HIS ENTIRE CAREER, BUT IT WAS

206
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
WHEN HE TOLD THE PARENTS.

207
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
ALL OF THE PARENTS WAITING FOR

208
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
THE CHILDREN TO COME OUT.

209
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
THOUGHT THEY WERE STILL ALIVE.

210
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
THERE'S 20 PARENTS JUST TOLD

211
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE DEAD.

212
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
IT WAS AWFUL.

213
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000

224
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
HOW DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

225
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

226
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CANNOT DO THAT

227
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000

228
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
AND THEY NEED ALL OF US RIGHT

229
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000

233
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
BRING SOME PEACE TO SOME PEOPLE.

234
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000

240
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
FIRST OF ALL, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

241
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000

242
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
FAMILY IS HERE, THAT HELPS.

243
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
MY SONS CAME AND MY HUSBAND AND

244
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
THE DOG, SO WE'RE TOGETHER.

245
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.
IT WAS AWFUL.

246
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
>> YOU WERE IN YOUR CLASSROOM.

247
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
>> I WAS IN MY CLASSROOM.

248
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
>> YOU WERE IN YOUR CLASSROOM.

249
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

250
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, ABOUT 9:30,

251
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
9:40, WE HEARD NOISES AND THE

252
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM WAS STILL

253
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
ON, SO IT DIDN'T GO OFF, SO YOU

254
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
COULD HEAR WHAT SOUNDED LIKE

255
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
POPS, GUNSHOTS, OF COURSE, I'M

256
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
NOT GOING TO TELL THAT TO 5 YEAR

257
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
OLDS, AND I SAID WE'RE GOING

258
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
OVER IN A SAFE AREA AND WE'RE

259
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
GOING TO -- WE READ A STORY AND

260
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
KEPT THEM CALM.

261
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
DID A LOCKDOWN DRILL.

262
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
CLOSED THE DOOR, LOCKED, COVERED

263
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
THE WINDOWS.

264
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
AND, YOU KNOW, KEPT THE CHILDREN

265
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
WITH US.

266
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I HAVE OTHER ADULTS --

267
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
>> I FIND THAT AMAZING -- I FIND

268
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THAT AMAZING THAT FEARING THAT

269
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
YOU HEAR GUNSHOTS, YOU WERE ABLE

270
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
TO HAVE THE COMPOSURE TO SIT

271
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
DOWN AND READ TO YOUR STUDENTS.

272
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.

273
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

274
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
WITH 5-YEAR-OLDS, YOU CAN'T LOSE
IT.

275
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
SO, YOU KNOW, YOU JUST KIND

276
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
OF -- I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A
LONG TIME.

277
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
IT'S MY 18th YEAR OF TEACHING,

278
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
AND MY JOB WAS TO KEEP THEM

279
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
SAFE.

280
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I DIDN'T KNOW -- NO ANNOUNCEMENT
OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.

281
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
YOU KNOW, MY INSING THE WAS IT

282
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
WASN'T GOOD.
SO WE KEPT THEM CALM, STAYED IN

283
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
THE ROOM UNTIL THERE WAS BANGING

284
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
AT THE DOOR, WHICH WAS POLICE,

285
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
TROOPERS, WHOEVER WAS THERE, AND

286
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
THEY HAD US EXIT THE BUILDING

287
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
AND TOLD THE CHILDREN TO COVER

288
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
THEIR EYES AND WALK IN A LINE

289
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
AND LEAVE THE BUILDING AND

290
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
THAT'S WHEN WE WENT DOWN TOWARD

291
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
THE FIREHOUSE.

292
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
SO, YOU KNOW, WE WERE ALL SAFE.

293
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I HAD 19 CHILDREN IN THE ROOM

294
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
WITH ME, AND THANK GOODNESS,

295
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
THEIR PARENTS WERE ABLE TO COME,

296
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
PICK THEM UP, TAKE THEM HOME.

297
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
>> WHEN YOU WERE READING, DID

298
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
THE KIDS REALIZE SOMETHING WAS

299
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
GOING ON, OR THINK IT WAS A

300
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
DRILL LIKE BEFORE?

301
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
>> RIGHT, IT DIDN'T SEEM A

302
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
NATURAL THING, ALTHOUGH WE DO

303
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
PRACTICE DRILLS, AND WE JUST

304
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
SAID, WELL, WE'RE NOT REALLY

305
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
SURE, BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE

306
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
SAFE, BECAUSE WE'RE SITTING OVER

307
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
HERE AND WE'RE ALL TOGETHER.

308
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
AND THAT'S, YOU KNOW, AS WE GOT

309
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
DOWN TO THE FIREHOUSE, LATER ON,

310
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
THERE WAS A LOT OF THE EVENTS

311
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
STARTED TO UNFOLD THROUGHOUT THE

312
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
DAY, I THINK SOME OF THEM

313
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
REALIZED THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT

314
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
WAS GOING ON, SAW OTHER PEOPLE

315
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
UPSET, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE JUST

316
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
HELD THEM CLOSE UNTIL THEIR

317
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
PARENTS CAME AND WE RELEASED

318
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
THEM, AND, YOU KNOW, MY ROOM, MY

319
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
CHILDREN, WERE ALL ACCOUNTED

320
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
FOR, AND SAFE IN MY KINDERGARTEN
CLASSROOM.

321
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
>> FOR ALL OF US,

322
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
INCOMPREHENSIBLE, YOU KNEW THE

323
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
CHILDREN, THE FAMILIES INVOLVED.

324
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE LOST THEIR

325
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
LIVES.

326
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I CERTAINLY WON'T ASK YOU ABOUT

327
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
ANY OF THE KIDS.

328
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
WHAT DO YOU WANT THE WORLD TO

329
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
KNOW ABOUT YOUR COLLEAGUES?

330
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
>> YEAH, I MEAN, WE HEARD A LOT

331
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
OF THINGS AS WE WERE DOWN AT THE

332
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
FIREHOUSE.

333
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WERE TEXTING

334
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
NEWS REPORTS AND THIS ONE, THAT

335
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
ONE, I'M SURE -- I'M NOT SURE

336
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
STILL OF THE MAGNITUDE OF WHO

337
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
EVERYONE IS, I HEAR SIX OR SEVEN

338
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
ADULTS AND MANY CHILDREN, AND,

339
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
YOU KNOW, I KNOW THOSE FIRST

340
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
GRADERS WERE CHILDREN I HAD IN
MY ROOM LAST YEAR.

341
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
SO THOSE PARENTS WERE SHOWING UP

342
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
TODAY, AND THEY COULDN'T FIND

343
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THEIR CHILDREN, AND, YOU KNOW,

344
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
THEY WERE ALL TAKEN TO SEPARATE

345
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
ROOMS AND SO -- I DON'T KNOW WHO

346
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
THEY ALL ARE, BUT I'M SURE AS

347
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
THE DAYS UNFOLD, IT WILL NOT

348
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
BE -- IT WILL NOT BE GOOD NEWS

349
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
FOR MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE.

350
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
>> AND -- YEAH, IT'S REALLY

351
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
BEYOND WORDS, AND I APPRECIATE
YOU TAKING A FEW MOMENTS TO TALK

352
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
TO US TONIGHT.

353
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
IT REALLY IS --
>> WELL --

354
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
>> JANET, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

355
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
COMPOSURE.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

356
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
>> IT'S EXTRAORDINARY WHAT YOU

357
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
DID, AND THE OTHER COLLEAGUES OF

358
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
YOURS.
>> SOME OF THOSE TEACHERS WERE

359
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
HEROES.

360
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
ONE OF THE TEACHERS, SHE LOCKED

361
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
EVERYBODY IN THE BATHROOM.

362
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
AND WOULDN'T OPEN THE DOOR.

363
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
YOU KNOW, I THINK WE DO THIS AS

364
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
TEACHERS, WE ARE TRAINED, WE DO

365
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
HAVE DRILLS, WE TALK TO THE

366
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
KIDS, AND IN CASE SOMETHING WERE

367
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
TO HAPPEN, THIS IS WHAT WE DO.

368
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
AND IT'S KIND OF WHAT HAPPENED

369
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
TODAY.

370
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
EVERYBODY JUST INSTINCTIVELY

371
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
KEPT THEIR KIDS SAFE.

372
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
>> A LOT OF TEACHERS I THINK OF
HEROES, AND YOU AND YOUR

373
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
COLLEAGUES SHOWED THAT TODAY.

374
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
>> THANK YOU.

375
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
>> I WISH YOU PEACE AND STRENGTH

376
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
IN THE DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD.

377
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
AMY SEIVER IS JOINING US.

378
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
SHE IS A PARENT.

379
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
HER DAUGHTER IS A STUDENT THERE.

380
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
HOW IS YOUR DAUGHTER DOING, YOUR
FAMILY, HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

381
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
>> OKAY.

382
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
IT'S A VERY ROUGH NIGHT HERE.

383
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
WHEN YOUR FIRST GRADER GOES TO

384
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
BED AND SAYS, MOMMY, IS ANYONE

385
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
FROM MY CLASS LAST YEAR, ARE

386
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
THEY ALL OKAY?

387
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
ARE THEY ALL OKAY?

388
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
AND YOU LOOK AT THEM AND SAY I'M

389
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
NOT REALLY SURE, IT'S NOT THE

390
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
BEST NIGHT WHEN YOU TELL THAT TO

391
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
YOUR 7-YEAR-OLD.

392
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
IT'S -- VERY, VERY SAD NIGHT FOR

393
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
THIS TOWN AND A LOT OF FAMILIES

394
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
HERE.

395
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
>> HAS YOUR DAUGHTER WANTED TO

396
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OR

397
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
FIRST GRADE, I DON'T -- DO THEY

398
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
WANT TO TALK?

399
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
>> SHE ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS

400
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL.

401
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
SHE CAUGHT WIND VERY QUICK THAT

402
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
WILL SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH

403
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
OUR PRINCIPAL.

404
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
WHICH WE DIDN'T TELL HER UNTIL

405
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
JUST NOW THAT, YES, SHE WAS

406
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
DEFINITELY HURT AND IT WASN'T

407
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
GOOD.

408
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
IT TOOK HER -- IT'S TAKING HER A

409
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
WHILE.

410
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I THINK TOMORROW WILL PROBABLY

411
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
BE HARDER FOR HER.

412
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I ALSO HAVE A FIFTH GRADER WHO

413
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
CAME OFF THE BUS CRYING, BECAUSE

414
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
SHE, ONE, HAD A SISTER WHO SHE

415
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
WAS WORRIED ABOUT, AND JUST

416
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
BASICALLY LEFT THAT SCHOOL, A

417
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
FEW MONTHS AGO AND I THINK FOR A

418
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
LOT OF THOSE KIDS, THEY KIND OF

419
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
ARE A LITTLE OLDER AND CAN GET

420
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
IT A LITTLE BIT FASTER, EVEN

421
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
THOUGH THEY WEREN'T IN IT.

422
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
SO IT'S -- THE QUESTIONS I THINK

423
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
ARE COMING.

424
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
THEY ARE NOT REALLY HERE YET,

425
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
ESPECIALLY FOR THE LITTLER ONES,

426
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
BUT IT'S STARTED AS I PUT THEM

427
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
TO BED TONIGHT, THE QUESTIONS.

428
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
>> DO YOU KNOW -- AS A MOM, DO

429
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
YOU KNOW HOW YOU ARE GOING TO

430
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS?

431
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF

432
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
PARENTS AROUND THE WORLD,

433
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
FRANKLY, WHOSE KIDS ARE GOING TO

434
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
BE ASKING THEM QUESTIONS IN THE

435
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
DAYS AHEAD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

436
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT YOU

437
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
ARE GOING TO SAY?

438
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
>> UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE BEEN

439
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
THROUGH A BIT OF TRAUMA IN OUR

440
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
OWN LIFE, FOR ME, AND I CAN'T

441
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
SPEAK FOR MOMS -- OTHER MOMS OR

442
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
MOMS AROUND THE WORLD, BUT FOR

443
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
MY FAMILY, I SPEAK KIND OF

444
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
QUIETLY AND TRUTHFULLY AND TRY
TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT

445
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
THEY ASK WITHOUT A LOT OF

446
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
DETAIL.
I DEFINITELY DON'T LIE.

447
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
IS PRINCE HOCHSPRUNG OKAY?

448
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
AND I SAID NO.

449
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
AND SHE SAID IS SHE DEAD?

450
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
AND I SAID YES.

451
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I TRY NOT TO OFFER TOO MUCH.

452
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY KNOW.

453
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR THEM TO

454
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
ASK.

455
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
IF THEY ASK, I GIVE THEM AN

456
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
HONEST ANSWER.

457
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
AND, UNFORTUNATELY, FOR A LOT OF

458
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
US IN TOWN, THE ANSWERS ARE NOT

459
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
GOOD.

460
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
>> THE PRINCIPAL, DAWN --

461
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
>> AND THEY ARE VERY SAD

462
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
TONIGHT, I DON'T THINK ANYONE

463
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
CAN ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS

464
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
EASILY -- THEY ARE DEFINITELY

465
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
NOT FUN ANSWERS.

466
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
>> I'VE HEARD SO MANY GREAT

467
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
THINGS ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL, DAWN

468
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
HOCHSPRUNG, AND THE FACT THAT

469
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
YOUR CHILD WAS ASKING ABOUT HER.

470
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW

471
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
ABOUT DAWN?

472
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
>> A VERY LOVELY COMPASSIONATE

473
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
WOMAN.

474
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
EXTREMELY HELPFUL.

475
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
AS A CHAIR ON ONE OF THE PTA

476
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
COMMITTEES, COULD NOT HAVE COME

477
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
OUT TO SUPPORT ME BETTER THIS

478
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
YEAR.

479
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I NEEDED SUPPORT THIS YEAR, AND

480
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE ON MY

481
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
TEAM, THE FIRST ONE TO HELP, THE

482
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
FIRST ONE TO BE THERE.

483
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
NEVER SAW HER WITHOUT A SMILE.

484
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
YOU KNOW, WAS JUST IN MY

485
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
DAUGHTER'S CLASSROOM THIS WEEK,

486
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
READING A BOOK TO THE KIDS.

487
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
VERY, VERY LOVELY, VERY LOVELY

488
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
WOMAN.

489
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
AND DEFINITELY HAD THE CHILDREN

490
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I BELIEVE HAD THE CHILDREN'S

491
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
BEST INTENTIONS ALL THE TIME.

492
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
SHE WAS ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR

493
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
THEM.

494
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
JUST A VERY SAD THING.

495
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
>> YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED, AND

496
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'M GOING TO LET YOU GO.

497
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I APPRECIATE YOU TALKING

498
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
TONIGHT, AND THANK YOU.

499
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I REALLY -- I JUST WISH YOU AND

500
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
YOUR FAMILY A LOT OF STRENGTH.

501
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
THANK YOU.

502
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
>> MY FAMILY IS ONE OF THE LUCKY

503
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
ONES, ANDERSON.

504
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE A LOT

505
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
OF PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, THAT AREN'T

506
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
SO LUCKY TONIGHT IN TOWN, BUT

507
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
THANK YOU, AND I -- WE PRAY FOR

508
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
ALL OF THE FAMILIES THAT ARE OUT

509
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
THERE TONIGHT.

510
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
>> YEAH.

511
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF

512
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
PRAYERS AROUND THE WORLD TONIGHT

513
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
FOR THE FAMILIES, AMY, THANK

514
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
YOU.

515
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
>> THANK YOU.

516
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
>> IT IS FRANKLY UNBELIEVABLE.

517
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
LET'S GO BACK TO SOLEDAD.

518
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
>> IT REALLY IS.
IT REALLY IS.

519
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
AND IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE I

520
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
THINK TO FATHOM WHAT THE PEOPLE

521
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
OF NEWTOWN ARE GOING THROUGH NOW

522
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
AND WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE

523
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
GOING THROUGH IN THE NEXT DAYS

524
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
AND WEEKS, ESPECIALLY THE
PARENTS AND SIBLINGS AND FAMILY

525
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
MEMBERS OF LITTLE CHILDREN WHO

526
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
DID NOT SURVIVE THE MASSACRE

527
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
TODAY.

528
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
SO MANY LIVES WERE LOST, SO MANY

529
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES WERE JUST

530
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
CHANGED FOREVER.

531
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND IN

532
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
SOME CASES COMPLETE STRANGERS

533
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
GATHERED AND CONTINUE TO GATHER

534
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
AT THIS HOUR, HOLD EACH OTHER,

535
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
CRY, AND TO REMEMBER.

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
A VIGIL TONIGHT, TOOK PLACE AT A

537
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
THROUGH THE NIGHT AND AN UPDATE

540
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
ON HOW THAT WENT TONIGHT.

541
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
JASON, THE MOOD HAS GOT TO BE SO

542
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
SAD.

543
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

544
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
TONIGHT'S VIGIL.

545
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
>> YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN A LOT OF

546
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
EMOTIONAL THINGS THROUGHOUT MY

547
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
LIFE, BUT TONIGHT WAS -- IT'S

548
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
REALLY HARD TO EXPLAIN.

549
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
THE VIGIL HERE TONIGHT.

550
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
SO MANY PEOPLE CAME OUT,
SOLEDAD.

551
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH ROOM FOR

552
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
EVERYBODY INSIDE ST. ROSA LINEA

553
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
CHURCH.

554
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
THEY CAME OUTSIDE.

555
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
STOOD IN THE FREEZING COLD.

556
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE STOOD INSIDE

557
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
AND LISTENED.

558
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
WHEN THE VIGIL THAT LET OUT, ALL

559
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
OF THOSE STANDING OUTSIDE WENT

560
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
INSIDE AND YOU HEARD SOME
SINGING AT ONE POINT.

561
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
GROUPS BROKE OFF INTO SEPARATE

562
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
GROUPS AND STARTED SINGING.

563
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
PEOPLE REALLY CAME HERE TONIGHT,

564
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
AND I KNOW YOU JUST HEARD

565
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
ANDERSON GIVE THAT VERY

566
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
EMOTIONAL INTERVIEW.
PEOPLE CAME HERE LOOKING FOR

567
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
ANSWERS, JUST LIKE THAT MOTHER

568
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
WAS TRYING TO GIVE ANSWERS TO

569
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
HER DAUGHTER.

570
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
AND IT'S DIFFICULT, IT'S VERY

571
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
TOUGH TO TRY AND GET THOSE

572
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
ANSWERS AT THIS TIME.

573
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
PEOPLE CAME LOOKING FOR THAT.

574
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
THEY CAME TO LEAN ON EACH OTHER
AND THEY TURNED TO THEIR FAITH.

575
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
THIS IS SUCH A SMALL COMMUNITY

576
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
THAT IT'S THE KIND OF PLACE

577
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
WHERE LITERALLY SO MANY OF THE

578
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
PEOPLE CAME OUT TONIGHT KNEW

579
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
SOMEONE.

580
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
KNEW ONE OF THE FACULTY MEMBERS,

581
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
KNEW ONE OF THE CHILDREN.

582
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
THEY TALKED ABOUT ONE THE LITTLE

583
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
GIRLS WHO LOST HER LIFE WHO WAS

584
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
SUPPOSED TO BE IN A CHRISTMAS

585
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
PAGEANT HERE AT THE CHURCH.

586
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
SPOKE TO ANOTHER MAN WHO KNEW
THE PRINCIPAL.

587
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
HE WANTED TO SPEAK OUT BEFORE HE

588
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
WENT INTO THE VIGIL AND I WANT

589
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
YOU TO LISTEN TO A LITTLE BIT OF
THAT CONVERSATION.

590
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
>> DAWN, THE PRINCIPAL AT SANDY

591
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
HOOK, I HAD DINNER WITH HER LAST

592
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
SPRING, SHE WAS EXCITED,

593
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
EXUBERANT, AN EXCEPTIONAL

594
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
EDUCATOR.

595
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
IT'S SAD.

596
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
THEY LOST THEIR LEADER TODAY AT

597
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
SANDY HOOK.
BUT MY PRAYERS WILL BE FOR OUR

598
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
COMMUNITY AS WELL.
>> ONE OF THE OTHER POINTS THAT

599
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
HE WANTED TO MAKE WAS THAT THIS

600
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
WAS A WOMAN WHO LOVED NOT ONLY

601
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
HER SCHOOL AND HER JOB, BUT SHE

602
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
LOVED ALL OF THE CHILDREN AT THE

603
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
SCHOOL AS WELL.

604
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
SOLEDAD.

605
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
>> SO, JASON, I KNOW YOU HAD A

606
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
CHANCE TO TALK TO THE DEACON,

607
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
AND I'M SURE HE WILL BE A FOCUS

608
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
OF MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

609
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
PEOPLE ARE HAVING.

610
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

611
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
>> IT'S -- IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR

612
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
HIM.

613
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
HE BECAME EMOTIONAL DURING OUR

614
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
CONVERSATION.

615
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
HE SAID THAT AT LEAST 100 PEOPLE

616
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
HAD COME TO THE CHURCH DOORS

617
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY LOOKING FOR
ANSWERS.

618
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
AND I SAID HOW DO YOU TRY AND
PROVIDE ANSWERS?

619
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
HE SAID IT'S TOO SOON TO COME UP

620
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
WITH SOME SORT OF A DEEP

621
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
PHILOSOPHICAL ANSWER AS TO WHY

622
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
THIS HAPPENED.

623
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
HE WAS ALSO FEELING THE EMOTION

624
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED AS WELL.

625
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
HE KNEW SOME OF THE CHILDREN

626
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
THAT WERE KILLED, INCLUDING SOME

627
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
OF THE FACULTY MEMBERS.

628
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
HE SPOKE ABOUT ONE CHILD IN

629
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
PARTICULAR, WHO HE REMEMBERED

630
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
RECEIVING HER FIRST COMMUNE HERE

631
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
AT THE CHURCH, AND A CHILD WHO

632
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
REALLY LEFT AN IMPRESSION UPON

633
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
HIM, AND HE EXPLAINS THE REASON
WHY.

634
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
>> I HEARD ONE OF THE VICTIMS,

635
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT IT, BUT I

636
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
HEARD ONE OF THE VICTIMS

637
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
RECENTLY, I THINK IT WAS

638
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
BIRTHDAY MONEY, HER BIRTHDAY

639
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
GIFTS AND DONATED IT TO THE

640
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
PARISH TO GIVE FOR HURRICANE

641
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
SANDY VICTIMS.

642
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
SHE'S 6 YEARS OLD.

643
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
SO THAT'S -- THAT MAKES IT VERY,

644
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
VERY PERSONAL.

645
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
AND VERY INTIMATE.

646
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
>> HIS STRUGGLE IS THAT HE HAS

647
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
GOT TO BE A ROCK FOR THE
COMMUNITY NOW.

648
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
HE HAS GOT TO TRY TO KEEP IT

649
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
TOGETHER AS MORE PEOPLE COME TO

650
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
HITO LEAN ON HIM FOR EMOTIONAL
SUPPORT.

651
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I ASKED HIM, I SAID WHAT DO YOU

652
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
DO?

653
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'M GOING TO GO HOME, HUG MY OWN

654
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
DAUGHTER, AND I'M GOING TO COME

655
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
BACK HERE AND BE THE SUPPORT
THIS COMMUNITY NEEDS.

656
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
SOLEDAD.

657
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
>> JASON CARROLL FOR US, THANK

658
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
YOU, JASON.

659
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
APPRECIATE THAT.

660
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
AND, ANDERSON, IT'S A QUESTION

661
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET AN

662
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
ANSWER TO.

663
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
THE WHY BEHIND IT.

664
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

665
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
THE SHOOTER, BUT THE MOTIVATION

666
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
IS ALWAYS THE THING I DON'T
THINK ANYBODY IS CLOSE TO

667
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
UNDERSTANDING AT THIS POINT.

668
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
>> YEAH, AND MAY NEVER.

669
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES

670
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
THERE ISN'T ANY WHY.

671
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
BUT WE'LL CONTINUE TO

672
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
INVESTIGATE, SOLEDAD, WE'LL COME

673
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
BACK TO YOU SHORTLY.

674
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT YET

675
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
RELEASED THE NAME OF THE

676
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
VICTIMS, THE PROCESS OF

677
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
IDENTIFICATION CONTINUES AT THIS

678
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
HOUR.

679
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
THOSE CHILDREN'S LITTLE BODIES

680
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
ARE STILL INSIDE THAT SCHOOL AND

681
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
WILL BE THROUGHOUT THE EVENING.

682
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
AS WE LEARN WHO THEY ARE, WHEN

683
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
IT'S APPROPRIATE, WE'LL FOCUS ON

684
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
THE LIVES.

685
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THEM WHEN

686
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
WE LEARN ABOUT THEM, WHAT
PARENTS WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM.

687
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
THE VICTIMS WE WANT HISTORY TO

688
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
REMEMBER AND HONOR.

689
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, THE

690
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
SCHOOL'S PRINCIPAL ARE AMONG THE

691
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000

692
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
YOU HEARD PARENTS TALK ABOUT

693
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
TONIGHT.

694
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
SHE BECAME THE PRINCIPAL AT

695
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
SANDY HOOK IN 2010.

696
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
SHE ARRIVED WITH 12 YEARS OF

697
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
PASSIONATE ABOUT HER JOB.

AN EXPERT ON CURRICULUM, FUN,

705
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
BUT A FIRM LEADER.

706
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
ONE FRIEND SAID SHE WAS THE KIND

707
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
OF PERSON YOU WOULD WANT TO BE

708
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
EDUCATING YOUR KIDS, AND THE

709
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
KIDS LOVED HER.

710
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
EVEN LITTLE KIDS KNOW WHEN

711
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
SOMEONE CARES ABOUT THEM AND

712
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
THAT WAS HER.

713
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
SHE TALKED ABOUT HER LOVE OF

714
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
READING.
SHE POSTED MESSAGES AND PHOTOS

715
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
ABOUT EVENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS AT
THE SCHOOL.

716
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
ON AUGUST 24th, SHE TWEETED,

717
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
CLASS.

723
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
SHE HAD RECENTLY INSTALLED A NEW

724
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
SECURITY SYSTEM WHERE ALL

725
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
VISITOR HAS TO RING A DOORBELL

726
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
AND WAIT TO BE BUZZED IN.

727
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
THE DOORS AUTOMATICALLY LOOK AT
9:00 A.M.

728
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000

ENTRANCE WAS SHOT OUT OR SMASHED

730
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
ALLOWING THE GUNMAN TO GET INTO
THE BUILDING.

731
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
WE DON'T HAVE ANY PHOTOGRAPHS OF

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000

THINK, YOU NEVER THINK IT'S

758
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT BASICALLY

759
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
IT HAPPENS ALL OVER THE WORLD AT

760
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000

>>> IT DOESN'T EVEN SEEM REAL.

778
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
IT JUST DOES NOT EVEN SEEM LIKE

779
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
IT'S POSSIBLE.

780
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
YOU READ IT IN THE PAPER, SEE IT

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000

00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
AND SOMETHING HAPPENS SO CLOSE

784
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
TO HOME, IT'S LIKE I THINK I'M

785
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
STILL IN SHOCK, TO BE HONEST

786
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
WITH YOU.

787
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
>> WELL, NO DOUBT A LOT OF

788
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
PEOPLE FEELING THE IMPACT SAME

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
WAY TONIGHT.

790
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
THE MASSACRE INSIDE THE SCHOOL,

791
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
THE DEADLIEST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

792
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
SHOOTING IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

793
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
ALL THE WORDS SPOKEN TODAY, AND

794
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
ALL OF THE WORDS I'M SPEAKING

795
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
TONIGHT IN THIS HOUR, THEY ALL

796
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
SOUND SO SMALL IN THE FACE OF

797
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
THIS HORROR.

798
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
20 LITTLE CHILDREN, 7 ADULTS.

799
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
LAST NIGHT ALIVE, GETTING READY

800
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
FOR ANOTHER DAY OF SCHOOL,

801
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
TONIGHT THEY ARE GONE.

802
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE TO THE

803
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
NATION EARLIER, WE PLAYED SOME

804
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
OF IT BEFORE THE TOP OF THE

805
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
PROGRAM.
BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH HEARING

806
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
ALL OF WHAT HE SAID.

807
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
>> THIS AFTERNOON I SPOKE WITH

808
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
GOVERNOR MALLOY, FBI DIRECTOR

809
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
MUELLER.

810
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I OFFERED GOVERNOR MALLOY MY

811
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
CONDOLENCES ON BEHALF OF THE

812
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
NATION AND MADE IT CLEAR HE WILL

813
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
HAVE EVERY SINGLE RESOURCE HE

814
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THIS

815
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
HEINOUS CRIME, CARE FOR THE

816
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
VICTIMS, COUNCIL THEIR FAMILIES.

817
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
WE HAVE ENDURED TOO MANY OF

818
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
THESE TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST FEW

819
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
YEARS, AND EACH TIME I LEARN THE

820
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
NEWS, I REACT NOT AS A

821
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
PRESIDENT, BUT AS ANYBODY ELSE

822
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
WOULD, AS A PARENT, AND THAT WAS

823
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
ESPECIALLY TRUE TODAY.

824
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I KNOW THAT THERE IS NOT A

825
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
PARENT IN AMERICA WHO DOESN'T

826
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
FEEL THE SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF

827
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
THAT I DO.

828
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

829
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

830
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

831
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

832
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

833
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
AHEAD OF THEM, BIRTHDAYS,

834
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
GRADUATIONS, WEDDINGS, KIDS OF
THEIR OWN.

835
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

836
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
TEACHERS, MEN AND WOMEN WHO

837
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING

838
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
OUR CHILDREN FULFILL THEIR

839
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
DREAMS, SO OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN

840
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
TODAY FOR THE PARENTS AND

841
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
GRANDPARENTS, SISTERS AND

842
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE

843
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
CHILDREN, AND FOR THE FAMILIES

844
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
OF THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST.

845
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

846
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
PARENTS OF THE SURVIVORS AS

847
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
WELL.

848
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
FOR AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE TO

849
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

850
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
TONIGHT, THEY KNOW THAT THEIR

851
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN

852
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY,

853
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
AND NO WORDS WILL EASE THEIR
PAIN.

854
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
AS A COUNTRY, WE HAVE BEEN

855
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
THROUGH THIS TOO MANY TIMES.

856
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
WHETHER IT'S AN ELEMENTARY

857
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN OR A SHOPPING

858
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
MALL IN OREGON OR A TEMPLE IN

859
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
WISCONSIN, OR A MOVIE THEATER IN

860
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
AURORA OR A STREET CORNER IN

861
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
CHICAGO, THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE

862
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THESE

863
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
CHILDREN ARE OUR CHILDREN.

864
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME

865
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
TOGETHER AND TAKE MEANINGFUL

866
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
ACTION TO PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES

867
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
LIKE THIS, REGARDLESS OF THE

868
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
POLITICS.

869
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
THIS EVENING, MICHELLE AND I

870
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
WILL DO WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT

871
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
IN AMERICA WILL DO.

872
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
WHICH IS HOLD OUR CHILDREN A

873
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
LITTLE TIGHTER, TELL THEM WE

874
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
LOVE THEM AND REMIND EACH OTHER

875
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
HOW DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

876
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

877
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CANNOT DO THAT

878
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
TONIGHT, AND THEY NEED ALL OF US

879
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
RIGHT NOW IN OUR DAYS TO COME,

AS PRESIDENT TO HELP, BECAUSE

884
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
WHILE NOTHING CAN FILL THE SPACE

885
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
OF THE LOST CHILD OR LOVED ONE,

886
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
ALL OF US CAN EXTEND A HAND TO

887
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
THOSE IN NEED, TO REMIND THEM

888
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000

WE ARE PRAYING FOR THEM, THAT

890
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
THE LOVE THEY FELT FOR THOSE

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
THEY LOST ENDURES NOT JUST IN

892
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
THEIR MEMORIES, BUT ALSO IN

893
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
OURS.

894
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF THE

BROKENHEARTED AND BIND UP THEIR

898
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
WOUNDS.

IT IS SHOCKING WHEN IT HAPPENS

914

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
>> DID -- DOES YOUR DAUGHTER

919
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT WITH YOU?

920
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
OR ARE YOU ENCOURAGING HER TOO?

921
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
HOW DO YOU HANDLE THIS?

922
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
A LOT OF PARENTS AROUND THE

923
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
WORLD ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

924
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
WHAT TO SAY TO THEIR CHILD.

925
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
>> YOU KNOW, THE HARD THING FOR

926
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
ME IS, ANDERSON, I'M A NEW

927
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
YORKER, SO I'M VERY ACCUSTOMED

928
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
TO MANHATTAN AND ACCUSTOMED TO

929
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
ALWAYS TELLING MY KIDS TO BE

930
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
CAREFUL.

931
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I GUESS YOU NEVER EXPECT IT TO

932
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
HAPPEN IN YOUR SCHOOL, AND AT

933
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
THE END OF THE DAY, YOU JUST --

934
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'M LETTING HER TALK.

935
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
SHE'S MENTIONED QUITE A BIT

936
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL, WHO MANY OF

937
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
US HAVE WORKED WITH, AND I

938
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
ADORED HER.

939
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I WORKED WITH HER PERSONALLY

940
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
WITH MY BUSINESS.

941
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
THAT IS ONE PERSON I KNOW WE'VE

942
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
LOST ON A PERSONAL LEVEL.

943
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE

944
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
COUNSELORS AT THE INTERMEDARY

945
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
SCHOOL TOMORROW, AND I ALREADY

946
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
TOLD MY CHILDREN, THEY ARE ALL

947
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
WELCOME TO GO THERE.

948
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
WE ARE PLANNING ON DOING THAT
TOMORROW, SO IF THEY NEED TO

949
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
SPEAK TO SOMEBODY, THEY WILL.

950
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
>> HAS YOUR DAUGHTER SAID MUCH

951
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
ABOUT WHAT SHE SAW OR WHAT SHE
HEARD?

952
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
>> SHE DID MENTION THAT SHE DID,

953
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
OF COURSE, HEAR GUNSHOTS, AND ON

954
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
THE SAME FLOOR, AND SHE -- HER

955
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
TEACHER, MANAGED TO TAKE TWO

956
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
CHILDREN OUT OF THE HALLWAY,

957
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
PULL THEM INTO THE CLASSROOM,

958
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
LOCK THE DOOR AND MOVE EVERYBODY

959
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM,

960
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
WHEN, YOU KNOW, IT WAS VERY

961
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
CONFUSING AS IT WOULD BE IN ANY

962
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
OF THESE CASES TO GO AND PICK UP
YOUR CHILD, ONCE WE FIGURED OUT

963
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
THAT EVERYTHING WAS DISPATCHED

964
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
TO SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY, I WAS

965
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
ONE OF THE FIRST PARENTS THERE
ALONG WITH A FRIEND OF MINE, WE

966
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
BOTH FIGURED OUT WHAT WAS GOING

967
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
ON, RAN OVER THERE, THEY WERE

968
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
VERY SMART TO GET THEM OUT OF
THE BUILDING, MOVED THEM OVER TO

969
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
THE FIREHOUSE.

970
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
YOU COULD SEE MY DAUGHTER'S

971
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
TEACHER WAS VISIBLY UPSET AS

972
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
WELL AS THE CHILDREN THERE.

973
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
SHE DID A VERY HEROIC THING.

974
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
PULLED TWO KIDS OUT OF THE

975
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
HALLWAY, SHOVED THEM INTO THE

976
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
CLASSROOM AND LOCKED THAT DOOR.

977
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
THE KIDS WILL SUFFER FROM THIS.

978
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE, A

979
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVENT THAT WILL

980
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
TAKE TIME FOR HEALING AND AS

981
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
LONG AS EVERYONE GETS THE PROPER

982
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
HELP, IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU

983
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
SHAKE OFF VERY EASILY AND

984
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
CERTAINLY NOT FOR LITTLE PEOPLE

985
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
AND WE LOST A LOT OF BABIES

986
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
TODAY IN THIS TOWN AND THERE ARE

987
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
A LOT OF VERY SAD FAMILIES, AND

988
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
AS EVERYONE CAN THINK, YOU NEVER

989
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
THINK IT WILL HAPPEN, BUT

990
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
BASICALLY IT HAPPENS ALL OVER

991
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
THE WORLD AT THIS POINT, SO WE

992
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
HAVE TO BE VERY COGNIZANT OF

993
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
MENTAL HEALTH AND GUN CONTROL IN

994
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
MY EYES AND HOW SCHOOLS ARE

995
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
LOCKED UP THESE DAYS.

996
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE.

997
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
YOU WOULDN'T THINK TO TAKE YOUR

998
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
CHILDREN TO SCHOOL YOU HAVE TO

999
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
WORRY ABOUT SOMEONE GOING IN AND

1000
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
BLOWING THEM ALL UP.

1001
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE STATE OF

1002
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
AFFAIRS, BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,

1003
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
IT'S OUR REALITY THESE DAYS.

1004
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
>> DENISE, I'M SORRY THAT

1005
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
REALITY WAS VISITED UPON YOUR

1006
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
DAUGHTER TODAY.

1007
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
AND EVERYBODY ELSE.

1008
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
AND I WISH YOU STRENGTH AND

1009
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
PEACE IN THE DIFFICULT DAYS

1010
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
AHEAD.

1011
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
THANK YOU FOR TALKING TONIGHT.

1012
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
>> OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH,

1013
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
ANDERSON.

1014
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
>> AND THERE WILL BE A LOT OF

1015
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD.

1016
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
LET'S GO BACK TO SOLEDAD.

1017
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

1018
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
SO, ANDERSON, AS WORD START TO

1019
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE STATE

1020
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
TODAY, SO DID THE SHOCK, SO DID

1021
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
THE HORROR AND NOW THERE IS THE

1022
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
GRIEVING.

1023
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
>> YOU CAN NEVER BE PREPARED FOR

1024
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
THIS KIND OF INCIDENT.

1025
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
WHAT HAS HAPPENED, WHAT HAS

1026
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
TRANSPIRED AT THAT SCHOOL

1027
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
BUILDING, WILL LEAVE A MARK ON

1028
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
THIS COMMUNITY AND EVERY FAMILY

1029
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
IMPACTED.

1030
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I ONLY ASK THAT ALL OF OUR

1031
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
FELLOW CITIZENS HERE IN THE

1032
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE

1033
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
WORLD, WHO HAVE ALREADY OFFERED

1034
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
THEIR ASSISTANCE REMEMBER ALL OF

1035
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
THE VICTIMS IN THEIR PRAYERS.

1036
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
>> THAT WAS CONNECTICUT'S

1037
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
GOVERNOR, DAN MALLOY SPEAKING

1038
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
EARLIER TODAY.
HE SAID HIS MAIN RESPONSIBILITY

1039
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
NOW IS THE INVESTIGATION ALONG

1040
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
WITH LOCAL AND FEDERAL

1041
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
AUTHORITIES.

1042
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE ONCE AGAIN

1043
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
THAT IS THE FOCUS NOW.

1044
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, HANDLING OUR
COVERAGE OF THE INVESTIGATION.

1045
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
LET'S FOCUS FIRST ON WHAT WE

1046
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
KNOW ABOUT THE SHOOTER.

1047
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
>> NOT VERY MUCH.

1048
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
THAT HE IS 20 YEARS OLD, WE

1049
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
UNDERSTAND THAT HE CAME TO THE

1050
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
SCHOOL WITH THREE WEAPONS, TWO

1051
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
OF THEM WERE HANDGUNS, ONE
DESCRIBED AS A GLOCK.

1052
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
ONE DESCRIBED AS A SIG SAUER,

1053
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
AND ANOTHER ONE NOT FOUND IN THE

1054
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
CLASSROOM WITH HIM, BUT INSTEAD

1055
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
WAS FOUND IN A CAR OUTSIDE THE

1056
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
SCHOOL, AND THAT IS CALLED

1057
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
A .223 BUSHMASTER, A SEMI

1058
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
AUTOMATIC WEAPON.

1059
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
IT SEEMS THOSE GUNS WERE NOT

1060
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
REGISTERED TO HIM.

1061
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
BUT WE ARE TOLD ACCORDING TO OUR

1062
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES THEY

1063
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
BELONG TO HIS MOTHER WHICH IS --

1064
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
DON'T HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR
THAT RIGHT NOW.

1065
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
>> WERE ALL THOSE GUNS LEGALLY

1066
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
PURCHASED IN THIS STATE?

1067
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
>> YES, THEY WERE LEGALLY

1068
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
PURCHASED AND PURCHASED IN THE

1069
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
STATE OF CONNECTICUT.

1070
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
WE BELIEVE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

1071
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
LIVING WITH HIS MOTHER.

1072
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
OUR SOURCES TELL US HIS MOTHER'S

1073
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
BODY WAS FOUND INSIDE A

1074
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
RESIDENCE AND SHE LIVES IN THIS

1075
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
AREA, SO IT'S POSSIBLE HE LIVED

1076
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
WITH HIS MOTHER.
STILL WAITING ON THAT DETAIL.

1077
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
>> SOME CONFUSION AS WELL WITH

1078
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
HIS BROTHER.

1079
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
POLICE WENT TO HOBOKEN TO DO AN

1080
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
INVESTIGATION THERE, AND TOOK

1081
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
THE BROTHER OFF FOR QUESTIONING

1082
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
AS WELL.

1083
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
>> THE BROTHER IS OLDER, 24

1084
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
YEARS OLD, HE DOES LIVE IN AN

1085
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
APARTMENT IN HOBOKEN, AND THEY

1086
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
DID GO TO HIM TO ASK HIM

1087
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS BROTHER.
EVERYBODY TIGHTLIPPED ABOUT

1088
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
EXACTLY WHAT HE TOLD THE

1089
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
AUTHORITIES.

1090
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
BUT ALSO HIS FATHER HAS BEEN

1091
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
QUESTIONED AS WELL.

1092
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
HIS FATHER IS DIVORCED FROM THE

1093
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
MOTHER WHO WAS KILLED IN THIS

1094
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
INCIDENT AND WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING

1095
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THAT AS

1096
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
WELL.

1097
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
>> SUSAN CANDIOTTI, THE

1098
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
JUST IN CASE YOU JOINED US.

1104
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
WE'RE INTENTIONALLY LIMITING THE

1105
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
USE OF THE KILLER'S NAME.

1106
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
WE DON'T WANT TO USE IT OVER AND

1107
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
OVER AGAIN.

1108
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
WE ARE TRYING TO LEARN MORE

1109
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
ABOUT WHAT LED THIS PERSON TO

1110
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
THE SCHOOL.

1111
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
DREW GRIFFIN JOINS US LIVE.
>> HAVING COVERING SO MANY OF

1112
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
THESE, A SHOOTER WITH POSSIBLE

1113
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, A FAMILY

1114
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THOSE

1115
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
ISSUES, SOMETHING SNAPS, GUNS

1116
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
EASILY ACCESSED AND WE HAVE THE

1117
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
OUTBURST OF VIOLENCE IN THE CASE

1118
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
OF THIS 20-YEAR-OLD SHOOTER,

1119
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
BEGINNING PLAY OUT IN EXACT THAT

1120
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
WILL ORDER.

1121
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
HERE IS WHAT WE DO KNOW.

1122
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
THE 20-YEAR-OLD SHOOTER HAD AN

1123
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
OLDER BROTHER.

1124
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
THAT BROTHER REPORTEDLY TOLD ABC

1125
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
NEWS THAT THE SHOOTER HAD A

1126
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
PERSONALITY DISORDER AND ALSO
MENTIONED AUTISM.

1127
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
CNN HEARD THAT SAME INFORMATION

1128
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
FROM A MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF A

1129
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
FRIEND OF THE SHOOTER'S IN

1130
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
NEWTOWN WHERE THE SHOOTER LIVED.

1131
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
WE CAN CONFIRM THE GUNS, TWO

1132
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
HANDGUNS AND SEMI AUTOMATIC

1133
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
RIFLE WERE LEGALLY OWNED BY THE

1134
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
SHOOTER'S MOTHER, NOW DECEASED,

1135
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
YOU CAN SEE THE PICTURE OF THE

1136
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
GUN THERE, AND SOMEWHAT STANDARD

1137
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
IN THESE CASES, WE FIND PEOPLE

1138
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
THAT ARE SHOCKED THAT THE

1139
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
PARTICULAR SHOOTER COULD HAVE

1140
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
BEEN INVOLVED IN ANYTHING LIKE

1141
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
THIS, AS IS THE CASE WITH ONE OF

1142
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
THE SHOOTER'S FORMER CLASSMATES

1143
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
AND FORMER SCHOOL BUS DRIVER.

1144
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
>> HE WAS JUST A KID.

1145
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
>> JUST A KID?

1146
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
>> JUST A KID.

1147
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
>> NEVER ANTI SOCIAL?

1148
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
>> NO, NO.

1149
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
>> TROUBLE MAKER?
>> NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

1150
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
>> NOTICEABLE?

1151
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
DID HE JUST KIND OF BLEND INTO

1152
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
THE BACKGROUND?
>> YEAH.

1153
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
NOTHING THAT WOULD WARRANT ANY

1154
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
OF THIS.
>> HE WENT AFTER HER MOM AND HER

1155
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
CLASS OF KIDS, CAN YOU WRAP YOUR

1156
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
HEAD AROUND THAT?

1157
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
>> NO, I CANNOT.

1158
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD DO
ANYTHING LIKE THIS?

1159
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
>> YOUR GENERAL SENSE IS WHAT?

1160
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
>> THIS IS -- THIS IS

1161
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
UNSPEAKABLE.

1162
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT --

1163
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I'M STILL IN SHOCK.

1164
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
EXCUSE ME A MOMENT.

1165
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I WANT TO GO.

1166
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
>> HE WAS A NICE KID.

1167
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
VERY POLITELY.

1168
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
SHE RAISED VERY NICE BOYS TO ME.
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S A SHOCK.

1169
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
TO EVEN KNOW THEM AND REALIZE

1170
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
WHO THEY ARE, AND WHAT HE DID.

1171
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT

1172
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
HAPPENED THAT HE SNAPPED, WHAT

1173
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
HAVE YOU, AND TOOK SUCH INNOCENT

1174
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
LIVES.

1175
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
>> SO WHAT CAN WE EXPECT?

1176
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
WELL, ANDERSON, AS WE'VE LEARNED

1177
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
IN THE OTHER CASES, VIRGINIA

1178
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
TECH, THE SHOOTING OF

1179
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
CONGRESSMAN GIFFORDS, THE MASS

1180
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
KILLING AT THE MOVIE THEATER IN

1181
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
AURORA, COLORADO, IN THE COMING

1182
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
DAYS, MAYBE BY TOMORROW, WE'LL

1183
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
SEE MULTIPLE WARNING SIGNS,

1184
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
DANGEROUS MESSAGES, IGNORED OR
PERHAPS OR EVEN PRACTICE

1185
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
SESSIONS OR AN OBSESSION WITH

1186
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
THE MOM'S GUNS THAT WEREN'T
TAKEN SERIOUSLY OR THE FAMILY IN

1187
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
MANY CASES DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO

1188
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
HANDLE THE SITUATION.

1189
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
THEY DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO TURN

1190
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
AND THERE WILL NEVER BE AN
ANSWER OR EXPLANATION THAT COULD

1191
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
REASON WE FOUND OUT SO SOON

1192
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
WHERE THESE GUNS CAME FROM,

1193
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
CONNECTICUT HAS IT'S OWN

1194
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
REGISTRY, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

1195
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
CERTIFICATE TO OWN A HANDGUN

1196
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
THAT COMES WITH A -- A TEST --

1197
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
NOT A TEST, BUT A CLASS.
A HANDGUN SAFETY CLASS.

1198
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
NO ONE UNDER 21 CAN OWN A

1199
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
HANDGUN AND THEY HAVE AN ASSAULT

1200
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
WEAPONS BAN.

1201
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
THIS ASSAULT RIFLE, I DON'T HAVE

1202
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
THE DETAILS IF IT WAS LEGALLY

1203
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
OWNED, SHE MUST HAVE OWNED IT

1204
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
BEFORE 1993 AND ALSO HAD A
CERTIFICATE OF POSSESSION

1205
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
REGISTERED WITH THE STATE.

1206
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
SOME OF THE OLDER GUNS WERE

1207
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
GRANDFATHERED IN.

1208
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
CAN'T HAVE AN ASSAULT WEAPON

1209
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
PURCHASED IN CONNECTICUT AS I

1210
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
READ FROM THE LAW.

1211
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
>> HOW WERE THEY STORED?

1212
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
IN A LOCKED BOX?

1213
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
A LOT WE DON'T KNOW.

1214
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
DREW, APPRECIATE IT.

1215
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
>>> FOR PARENTS, THE ORDEAL

1216
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
BEGAN WITH THE WORD THAT SANDY

1217
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WAS ON

1218
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
LOCKDOWN.

1219
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
THE FIRST WORD THAT PARENTS GOT.
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL HAVE

1220
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
MORE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

1221
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

1222
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
>>> I WAS IN NEW YORK, AND MY

1223
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
WIFE CALLED ME IN HISSTERRICS,

1224
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
SO I RUSHED HOME, AND SHE -- SHE

1225
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
HEARD SOME BANGS AND SHE WENT

1226
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
RUNNING INTO A BATHROOM.

1227
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
>> IT WAS FRIGHTENING, IT WAS

1228
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
LIKE MY HEART STOPPED BEATING.

1229
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN IT.

1230
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
>> JASON CARROLL GAVE US A LOOK

1231
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
INSIDE THE VIGIL TONIGHT.

1232
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
WE'RE JOINED BY THE CHURCH'S

1233
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
PASTOR.

1234
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A PARENT?

1235
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A PARENT WHO
IS GOING THROUGH THE WORST

1236
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
POSSIBLE KIND OF GRIEF

1237
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
IMAGINABLE?

1238
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
>> YOU KNOW, I HAD A NUMBER OF

1239
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
CONVERSATIONS WITH PARENTS

1240
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
TODAY.

1241
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE BELONG TO THE

1242
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
PARISH COMMUNITY.

1243
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
THE WORDS ARE FEW.

1244
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
WHAT CAN YOU SAY?

1245
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
MANY SAID THANK YOU FOR MANY

1246
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
HERE WITH US.

1247
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
WE PRAYED TOGETHER, HUGGED EACH

1248
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
OTHER, A LOT OF TEARS.

1249
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
CERTAINLY A LOT OF EMOTION, AND

1250
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I -- I DON'T REALLY THINK IT'S

1251
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
SETTLED INTO THEIR LIVES.

1252
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
THEIR CHILD HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM

1253
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
THEM.

1254
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I MUST SAY FOR THE PARENTS I

1255
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
SPOKE WITH TODAY, THERE WAS A

1256
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LOVE FOR

1257
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
THESE CHILDREN, AND I KNOW THAT

1258
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
THE DAYS AHEAD ARE GOING TO BE

1259
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.

1260
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
WE AS A COMMUNITY, CERTAINLY AS

1261
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE

1262
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
BEYOND ANY HUMAN CONTROL.
WE HAVE TO TEACH THESE CHILDREN

1263
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
THEY HAVE TO TRUST.

1264
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
YOU KNOW, I KNOW IT'S A

1265
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
DIFFICULT WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE

1266
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
AND VERY DIFFICULT TO TRUST

1267
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
EVERYONE, BUT THEY HAVE TO HAVE

1268
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
FAITH, FAITH IN GOD AND FAITH

1269
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
WITH EACH OTHER AND I HOPE

1270
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
PARENTS LEARN THE VALUE OF
FAMILY AND KEEP THE VALUES

1271
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
STRAIGHT.

1272
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
THE CHILDREN NEED TO KNOW THEY

1273
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
ARE LOVED AND THEY ARE IN AN

1274
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY CAN GROW

1275
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
UP TO BE PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS.

1276
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU TAKE FEAR

1277
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
OUT OF A CHILD'S HEART EXCEPT BY

1278
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
LOVE.

1279
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
AND THESE CHILDREN WERE DEEPLY

1280
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
LOVED BY THEIR PARENTS.

1281
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I'M SURE WHEN THEY DROPPED THEIR

1282
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
CHILDREN OFF AT THE SCHOOL, THE

1283
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
LAST THING ON THEIR MINDS IS

1284
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
THIS THE WAY THE DAY WOULD END.
I HOPE PARENTS TAKE THE

1285
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THEIR

1286
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
CHILDREN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF
BEING FAMILY AND THE IMPORTANCE

1287
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
OF TRUSTING AND LOVING EACH

1288
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
OTHER.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS

1289
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
THINKING ABOUT TODAY, AFTER THE

1290
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
AURORA SHOOTING IN AURORA,

1291
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
COLORADO, THEY HAD A SORT OF

1292
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
MEMORIAL SERVICE, AND I REMEMBER

1293
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
THE SPEAKERS WOULD READ THE NAME

1294
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
OF EACH PERSON WHO WAS KILLED,

1295
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
AND THEN THE CROWD WOULD SHOUT

1296
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
BACK, WE WILL REMEMBER.

1297
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
WE WILL REMEMBER YOU.

1298
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
THAT WAS SO POWERFUL.

1299
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
AND I KEPT THINKING ABOUT THAT

1300
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
TODAY, OUR COVERAGE TONIGHT.

1301
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
WE EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF

1302
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
AN AWARENESS THAT EVIL DOES

1303
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
EXIST IN THIS WORLD, BUT THAT

1304
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
GOOD ALWAYS CONQUERS EVIL AND
THE ONLY WAY WE'LL CHANGE IS BY

1305
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
COMING TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY,

1306
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED

1307
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
TONIGHT.

1308
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER TO SUPPORT

1309
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
EACH OTHER AND TO ENCOURAGE EACH

1310
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
OTHER.

1311
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
TO LET EACH OTHER KNOW THERE IS

1312
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
A BETTER WAY TO LIVE.

1313
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID IF WE

1314
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
WORK TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY.

1315
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
>> MONSIGNOR, I KNOW IT'S BEEN A

1316
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
LONG DAY FOR YOU, A HORRIFIC DAY

1317
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
FOR YOU.

1318
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME

1319
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
TO TALK TO US.

1320
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
THANK YOU.

1321
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
>> THANK YOU.

1322
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
>> AGAIN, SOLEDAD, AS WE'VE BEEN
SAYING ALL NIGHT LONG AND ALL

1323
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
DAY LONG, THERE WILL BE MANY

1324
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD.

1325
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
>> NO QUESTION, FOR THOSE WHO

1326
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,000
HAVE LOST CHILDREN AND THOSE
WHOSE CHILDREN SURVIVED.

1327
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
TOUGH CONVERSATIONS.
MANY WERE TELLING US WHAT

1328
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
HAPPENED WHEN THEY CAME RACING

1329
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
THEY GOT WORD THAT THE SCHOOL

1330
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
WAS ON LOCKDOWN AND THEY WERE

1331
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
PANICKED.

1332
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
SOME TRIED TO RUN TO THE SCHOOL.

1333
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
SENT TO A NEARBY FIRE STATION,

1334
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
COMPLETELY FRANTIC SCENE BY ALL

1335
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
ACCOUNTS WE'VE HEARD.

1336
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
PEOPLE HAD TO BASICALLY SIT AND

1337
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
WAIT TO SEE IF THEIR CHILDREN

1338
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
WERE ALIVE OR NOT.
EARLIER, I SPOKE WITH CHRISTINE

1339
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
WILFORD ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE.

1340
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
HER SON IS A SECOND GRADER AT

1341
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
THE SCHOOL.

1342
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
HOW ARE YOU DOING NOW?

1343
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
>> IT'S STILL PROCESSING.
IT'S -- IT'S SCARY, SCARY.

1344
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
NO WORDS.
>> HOW IS YOUR SON DOING?

1345
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
ARE YOU ENCOURAGING HIM TO TALK

1346
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
AND SHARE OR TRYING TO TAKE HIS

1347
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
MIND OFF THE TERRIBLE THINGS

1348
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
THAT HE WITNESSED AND

1349
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
EXPERIENCES?

1350
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
>> WE'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT OF

1351
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
EACH.

1352
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
TRY TO SPOIL HIM AND, YOU KNOW,

1353
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
TAKE HIS MIND OFF, LET HIM PLAY

1354
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
THE PS3, STUFF LIKE THAT, AND

1355
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
THEN TRYING TO TALK AND PROCESS
WITH HIM, LETTING THEM KNOW WHEN

1356
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
WE FOUND OUT ABOUT OTHER

1357
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
CHILDREN THAT HE KNOWS.

1358
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
>> YOU'VE GOTTEN AN ELECTRONIC

1359
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
ALERT IS REALLY HOW YOU GOT THE

1360
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
MESSAGE, A ROBOCALL.

1361
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
HOW DID THAT COME ACROSS?

1362
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
WHAT WAS SAID?
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE MOST

1363
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
TERRIFYING THING.

1364
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
>> MY HUSBAND AND I WERE SITTING

1365
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
THERE, AND A NEIGHBOR WAS OVER

1366
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
AND WE GOT A ROBOCALL THAT ALL

1367
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
NEWTOWN SCHOOLS WERE IN LOCKDOWN

1368
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
DUE TO A REPORTED SHOOTING.
WE IMMEDIATELY GOT ONLINE.

1369
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
MY NEIGHBOR CALLED HER HUSBAND

1370
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
AND HE SAID HE HEARD IT WAS

1371
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
SANDY HOOK.

1372
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
WE HOPPED IN THE CAR AND WENT

1373
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
DOWN.

1374
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
>> THE SCHOOL WAS ON LOCKDOWN.

1375
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1376
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
>> I'M NOT SURE COMPLETELY WHAT

1377
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
THAT MEANS.

1378
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
WHEN I GOT THERE, ALL OF THE

1379
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
CHILDREN EVACUATED WERE IN THE
FIREHOUSE.

1380
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
WHICH IS CLOSE PITCH.

1381
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
>> HOW ARE THE KIDS HOLDING UP?
>> IT VARIES.

1382
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
MY SON SEEMED TO BE OKAY.

1383
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
MOM, I'M OKAY, I'M SAFE.
HE GAVE ME A BIG HUG.

1384
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
A LOT OF CHILDREN WERE CRYING
AND SCARED.

1385
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
>> HOW DID HE DESCRIBE WHAT
HAPPENED?

1386
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
>> HE SAID HE HEARD WHAT SOUNDED

1387
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
LIKE LARGE PANS FALLING, JUST

1388
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
LOUD NOISES.

1389
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
HE SAID HIS TEACHER STEPPED

1390
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM,

1391
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
IMMEDIATELY CAME BACK IN AND

1392
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
LOCKED THE DOOR AND HAD THEM ALL

1393
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
GET INTO A CORNER AND SIT DOWN

1394
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
AND JUST HAD THEM START READING

1395
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,000
QUIETLY.

1396
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
>> HOW MUCH TIME WENT BY BETWEEN

1397
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
THAT HAPPED AND BEFORE HE WAS
ABLE TO GET TO YOU?

1398
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.
HE ISN'T ABLE TO PIECE HOW MUCH

1399
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
TIME ACTUALLY PASSED.

1400
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
HE SAID AFTER A LITTLE WHILE, A

1401
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
POLICE OFFICER CAME AND TOOK

1402
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
THEM OUT OF THE BUILDING AND
BROUGHT THEM TO THE FIREHOUSE.

1403
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
>> WE KNOW THAT THE PRINCIPAL

1404
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
HAD INSTALLED A SYSTEM WHERE YOU

1405
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
HAVE TO BE BUZZED IN.
>> YES.

1406
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
AND IT'S BEEN THAT WAY FOR THE
TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN HERE.

1407
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
YOU HAD TO RING A DOORBELL AND

1408
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
BE LET IN, AND THE OFFICE IS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THOSE DOORS,

1409
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
THEY CAN LOOK OUT AND SEE WHO IS

1410
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
AT THE DOOR?

1411
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
>> ANY PARTICULAR REASON FOR

1412
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
THAT?

1413
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
IT'S VERY TYPICAL IN BIG CITIES,

1414
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
BUT COMMUNITIES PRETTY RURAL, A

1415
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
LITTLE BIT OF A RARITY

THERE'S BETWEEN 500 AND 600

1421

1423
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
IS IN THE BUILDING WITH OUR

00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
