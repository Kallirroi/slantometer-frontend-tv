THAT A RELATIVE SAYS THAT ADAM

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000

HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL TO

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
TRY TO CONNECT THIS HORRIBLE

68

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
DO WITH AUTISM.
>> I THINK SO.

70

AND I THINK, KATE, YOU CAN

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
PROBABLY EVEN TAKE IT A STEP

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
FURTHER.
THERE REALLY IS JUST NO EVIDENCE

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
OF A LINK BETWEEN AUTISM OR

74

THIS IDEA THAT PEOPLE HAVE

77

78

79

NOTION OF THAT.

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
BUT YESTERDAY I DECIDED TO LOOK

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE.

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
QUOTES.
IN THAT STUDY ONLY THREE PEOPLE

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
HAD EVIDENCE OF ANY VIOLENCE

WHATSOEVER AND REACTIVE

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000

I THINK WE CAN DISPEL THIS MYTH

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
THAT SOMEHOW AUTISM CONTRIBUTED

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000

93

107

I HAVE A 7, 5 AND 3-YEAR-OLD.

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU WANT TO

161
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
BE HONEST WITH SOMETHING LIKE

162
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
THIS.

163
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
AND I THINK THIS WHOLE -- MY

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
DAUGHTER WANTED TO KNOW THE

165
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
NAMES OF PEOPLE YESTERDAY.

166
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
SHE WANTED TO KNOW THE NAMES OF

167
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
SOME OF THESE CHILDREN AND SHE

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
WANTED TO KNOW IF HER SCHOOL WAS

169
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
GOING TO BE A SAFE PLACE TO GO.

170
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
AND I SAID THIS NEVER HAPPENED

171
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
IN DADDY'S SCHOOL OR MOMMY'S

172
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
SCHOOL AND THIS HAPPENED NOW BUT

173
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
WE DO ALL WE CAN TO KEEP YOU

174
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
SAFE.
EVERYONE KNOWS THEIR KIDS BEST

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
AND THE GRAPHIC DETAILS, I

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
THINK, OBVIOUSLY, AGE

177
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
APPROPRIATE SORT OF THINGS.

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
BUT I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY LESS

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
NECESSARY THAN JUST LETTING THEM

180
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
TALK AND THEN FILLING IN SOME OF

181
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
THE GAPS FOR THEM.

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

183
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
REMEMBER THAT IN MEDICINE WE SAY

184
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
YOU CHECK YOUR OWN PULSE FIRST

185
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
BEFORE GOING INTO A SITUATION.

186
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
CHECK YOUR OWN FEELINGS FIRST.

00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000

IT'S SIMPLE PHYSICS...

563
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
A BODY AT REST
TENDS TO STAY AT REST...

564
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
WHILE A BODY IN MOTION
TENDS TO STAY IN MOTION.

565
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
STAYING ACTIVE CAN ACTUALLY
EASE ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS.

566
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
BUT IF YOU HAVE ARTHRITIS,

567
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
STAYING ACTIVE
CAN BE DIFFICULT.

568
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
