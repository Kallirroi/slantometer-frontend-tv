00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
>> I THINK THERE'S SEVERAL WAYS

370
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
THIS PARENTS CAN PROTECT

371
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
THEMSELVES AND NOT WORRY THAT

372
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
THEY ARE GOING TO PUT ONTO THEIR

373
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
CHILDREN THEIR OWN FEARS AND

374
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
CONCERNS AND THESE BY TALKING TO

375
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
EACH OTHER AS PARENTS, TALKING

376
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
TO OTHER PARENTS AND MAKING SURE

377
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
THAT THEY HAVE AT LEAST DEALT

378
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
WITH THE FACT THAT THEY CAN

379
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
ASSURE SOME SAFETY TO THEIR

380
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
CHILDREN AND THAT THEY,

381
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
THEMSELVES, FEEL SAFE BUT

382
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
DEALING WITH SOME OF THE STUFF

383
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
BY TALKING TO OTHER AZULTS THE

384
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
ONLY WAY THEY ARE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO ALLEVIATE THEIR OWN

385
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
PRESSURES AND GUILT AND FEAR SO

386
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
THEY CAN LISTEN TO THEIR

387
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
CHILDREN WITHOUT PROJECTING.

388
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE PARENTS

389
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
WORKING TOGETHER WITH THEIR

390
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
SCHOOLS -- WITH THE CHILDREN'S

391
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
SCHOOLS TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS

392
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
FEEL SAFE?
WHAT SHOULD THE PARENTS BE

393
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
DOING?

394
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
>> IT IS IMPORTANT TO GROUP

395
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
TOGETHER SO EVERYBODY IS

396
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
TALKING, PROCESSING THIS AS A

397
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
GROUP SO YOU LIMIT THE ABILITY

398
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
FOR RUMORS AND FOR

399
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
MISINFORMATION, MISCOMMUNICATION

400
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
TO GET OUT THERE AND EVERYBODY

401
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
IS ON THE SAME PAGE.

402
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
AND YOUR CHILDREN AREN'T COMING

403
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
HOME WITH STORIES YOU CAN'T

404
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
EXPLAIN.
ALL PARENTS TOGETHER, UNIFIED AS

405
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
A COMMUNITY YOU ARE GOING TO BE

406
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
BETTER COMMUNICATING TOGETHER

407
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND MAKING

408
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
MORE STREAMLINED AND CONSISTENT.

409
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
AND IT REALLY LIMITS THE ABILITY

410
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
FOR PROBLEMS, RUMORS, ANXIETY

411
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
AND EVEN MORE EMOTION TO COME

412
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
OUT OF THIS.

413
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
>> SURE, DOCTOR THERE ARE SOME

414
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
PARENTS THOUGHT SAYING TO

415
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
THEMSELVES MAYBE I SHOULD KEEP

416
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
MY CHILD HOME FROM SCHOOL

417
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
TOMORROW THEY ARE AFRAID I GOD

418
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
FORBID, OF A COPYCAT OR

419
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

420
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THESE PARENT?

421
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
>> I WOULD TELL THEM THAT THOSE

422
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
FEELINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY NORMAL

423
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
TO HAVE BUT PLEASE DON'T GET

424
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
TRAPPED WITHIN THE FEAR OF THAT,

425
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
BECAUSE ONCE YOU GIVE INTO THAT,

426
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT

427
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
TO BREAK THAT BUT I THINK IT'S

428
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
IMPORTANT TO DISCUSS WITH YOUR

429
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
CHILD, IF YOU THINK THEY ARE
GOING TO BE AFRAID TO SEPARATE

430
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
FROM YOU, AND EVEN IF IT'S YOU

431
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
AFRAID TO SEPARATE FROM YOUR

432
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
CHILD, DO SOME TRANSITIONAL

433
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
OBJECT TYPE OF THING.

434
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
WRITE A NOTE THEY CAN KEEP WITH

435
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
THEM, TAKE A TEDDY BEAR TO

436
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
SCHOOL WITH THEM, SOME WAY TO

437
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
ALLOW THEM TO STAY CONNECTED TO

438
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
YOU EMOTIONALLY AND VICE VERSA

439
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
JUST A LITTLE OLDER THAN THEY

554
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
ARE, YOUR CHILDREN.

555
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
SO, TAKE THE TIME TONIGHT AND I

556
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
KNOW THAT IT'S -- IT'S

557
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
UNCOMFORTABLE, ESPECIALLY WHEN

558
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
WE, AS PARENTS, ARE STILL TRYING

559
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
TO PROCESS THIS OURSELVES.

560
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
SO, WE HAVE TO HAVE THE COURAGE

561
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
TO REALLY HAVE THAT DIFFICULT

562
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
CONVERSATION WITH OUR KIDS AND

563
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
TO, IN AN AGE-APPROPRIATE WAY.

564
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
AND YOU KNOW YOUR KIDS BETTER

565
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
THAN ANYBODY IN TERMS OF WHAT

566
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
THEY CAN HANDLE AND WHAT'S THE

567
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
RIGHT LANGUAGE TO USE, WHAT'S

568
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
THE RIGHT FRAMING FOR THIS THING

569
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ALL OF US,

570
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
AND LISTENING TO YOUR KIDS IS

571
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT.

572
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
>> LEVAR TO THAT, WHEN YOU TALK

573
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
ABOUT LISTENING TO YOUR KIDS YOU

574
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
CAN WOLF AND I WERE TALKING
MOMENTS AGO, YOU TELL SOME

575
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
CHILDREN, THEY MAY BE SILENT AND

576
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
STOIC AND MAY BE BECAUSE THEY

577
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
ARE BOLTING IT UP INSIDE,

578
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
WHETHER THEY ARE AFRAID OUR

579
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
UPSET BUT OTHER KIDS MAY TRULY

580
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
NOT BE THAT AFFECTED BY T AS A

581
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
PARENT IT IS SO HARD TO KNOW

582
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
WHICH CATEGORY YOUR CHILD FALL

583
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
NEWS.
HOW DO YOU TRY GET THE TONE

584
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
RIGHT AND NOT TAKE A CHILD WHO

585
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
SUSPECT AFRAID AND MAKE THEM
BECOME AFRAID?

586
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
>> IT'S DEMOCRATS, ISN'T IT?

587
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO GO AND HUG

588
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
OUR KIDS YOU THAT, IS THE THING

589
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
TO DO NOW, TAKE SOME TIME TO

590
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
PROCESS YOUR SSELF AS PARENTS.

591
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
TRUTHFULLY, TAKE A BATH, REALLY.

592
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I MEAN, DURING TIMES OF TRAUMA,

593
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
WATER SEEMS TO HELP.

594
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
NOT JUST A SHOWER, I'M TALKING

595
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
ABOUT -- GUYS, I HAVE DONE THE

596
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
SAME THING, I HAVE IMMERSED

597
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
MYSELF IN WATER TODAY TO HELP ME

598
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
PROCESS WHAT I JUST DON'T SEEM

599
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
TO HAVE A WAY TO UNDERSTAND.

600
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
AND SO I WOULD RECOMMEND, YOU

601
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
KNOW, BATHE YOUR KIDS.

602
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
THROW THEM IN THE TUB AND MAKE

603
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
SURE YOU GET A BATH YOURSELF.

604
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
AND ALLOW YOURSELF TO REALLY

605
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
FEEL WHAT YOU'RE FEELING AND

606
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
KNOW THAT YOUR KIDS ARE FEELING

607
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
IT, TOO AND LET THEM BE THE

608
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
GUIDE.
TAKE THE CUES FROM THEM.

609
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
BUT IF YOU'VE GOT ONE THAT'S

610
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
REALLY SILENT AND STOIC IT IS

611
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
IMPORTANT TO SORT OF SOUND THEM

612
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
OUT ON WHAT THEY KNOW, WHAT THEY

613
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
ARE AWARE OF AND HOW THEY FEEL

614
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
ABOUT IT, BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO

615
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
BE THE NATIONAL COVER WAS ON

616
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
PLAYGROUNDS, IN OFFICE

617
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
BUILDINGS, IN SCHOOLS, IN

618
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
AMERICA, FOR DAYS TO COME.

619
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
>> BECAUSE, LEVAR, WE GOT TO

620
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
MAKE SURE OUR CHILDREN KNOW

621
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
THEY'RE SAFE.

622
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
SO WHAT'S BEST WAY TO

623
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
COMMUNICATE THAT TO THE KIDS?

624
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
>> WELL, I'M ALL FOR LETTING

625
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
THEM KNOW THAT THE PERSON

626
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS IS NO

627
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
LONGER A THREAT TO ANYONE.

628
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
WE, THE ADULTS IN THE WORLD ARE

629
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
TAKING CARE OF ALL THE THINGS

630
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF IN

631
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
TERMS OF THE AFTERMATH OF THIS,

632
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
BUT THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THEY

633
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
ARE SAFE AND THAT THEY ARE GOING

634
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
TO CONTINUE TO BE SAFE.

635
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I RECOMMEND A LOT OF HUGS.
SIT AND READ WITH YOUR KIDS.

636
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
IT'S A GREAT WAY TO PASS THIS

637
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
TIME.

638
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
ONCE, YOU KNOW, I'M LOVING THE

639
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
FACT THAT A LOT OF FAMILIES

640
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE REALLY

641
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
LIMITING THEIR CHILDREN'S

642
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
EXPOSURE AND OWN EXPOSURE TO THE

643
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
NEWS COVERAGE.
WE HAVE TO TAKE BREAKS FROM IT.

644
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
IT'S REALLY EASY TO BECOME

645
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
ABSOLUTELY SATURATED AND

646
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
OVERWHELMED BY IT.

647
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
SO, THESE ARE ALL GOOD THING TO

648
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
US REMEMBER.

649
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
MOST OF ALL, WE HAVE TO JUST

650
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
REMEMBER TO BE GENT WELL

651
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
OURSELVES AND EACH OTHER FOR A

652
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
WHILE.
ALL SORT OF WALKING AROUND OPEN

653
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
WOUNDS.
>> ARE THERE POSITIVE WAYS TO

654
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
ADDRESS THIS TRANG GUY CHILDREN,

655
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
PERHAPS WHEN THE CHILDREN ASK

656
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OTHER

657
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
CHILDREN, WHEN THEY ASK

658
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE 6 AND

659
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
7-YEAR-OLDS?
>> IT IS ALWAYS APPROPRIATE TO

660
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
ACKNOWLEDGE THE FEELINGS OF

661
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
CHILDREN A LOT OF WHAT I KNOW I

662
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
LEARNED FROM THE MASTER, FRED

663
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
ROGERS, HE WAS ALWAYS ONE FOR

664
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
MEETING KIDS WHERE THEY ARE AND

665
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL
DO.

666
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
AND DON'T FORGET THOSE HUGS.

667
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
>> HOW HAS THE TRAGEDY AFFECT

668
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
YOU HAD PERSONALLY?

669
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
>> IT'S DIFFICULT.

670
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME WITH IT.

671
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I REALLY AM.

672
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME.

673
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
AND I THINK BEING ABLE TO

674
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
EXPRESS MYSELF ON IT HELPS AN

675
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
AWFUL LOT.

676
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
WE -- WE ARE ALL EXPERIENCING

677
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
THIS TOGETHER AND WE ARE IN

678
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
UNCHARTERED TERRITORY HERE, SO

679
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
IN THIS MOMENT, I'M -- I FEEL

680
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
LIKE I'M HELPING AND SO I AM

681
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
A -- I FEEL LIKE I'M, YOU KNOW,

682
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'M FINE.

683
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'M FUNCTIONAL, BUT I KNOW AT

684
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
THE SAME TIME, I'M ALTERED.

685
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'M DIFFERENT TODAY THAN I WAS

686
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
YESTERDAY.
>> NOT JUST YOU, I THINK ALL OF

687
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
US FEEL EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.

688
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I THINK YOU'RE SPEAKING FOR A

689
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
LOT OF PEOPLE AND I SUSPECT THAT

690
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000

WILL BE MAKING SOME OF THOSE

694
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
SAME POINTS.

695
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
LEVAR BURTON, THANKS VERY MUCH

696
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000

THANKS VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US.

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
NOT RELYING ON SPEECHWRITERS OR

ANYTHING LIKE THAT TONIGHT.

703
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
>> I SUSPECT ALSO, AS A FATHER,

704
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
AS OPPOSED TO BEING PRESIDENT.

705
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
HE KNOWS HE HAS TO COMFORT THE

706
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
NATION RIGHT NOW, THAT IS HIS

707
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
RESPONSIBILITY, BUT HE IS ALSO

708
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
SPEAKING FROM THE HEART AS THE

709
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
FATHER OF TWO GIRLS.

710
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
>>> WE DO HAVE NEW INFORMATION

711
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
ABOUT HOW THE SUSPECTED GUNMAN

712
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
GOT INTO THE SANDY HOOK

713
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

714
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
WE JUST FOUND THAT OUT A FEW

715
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
MOMENTS AGO FROM THE CONNECTICUT

716

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Did you get that?

726
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Oh yeah.

727
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
That was amazing.

728
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Here you go.

729
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That was a fun trick!

730
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
See? Santa's okay.

731
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000

00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
DEAL WITH THIS PROPERLY.

TO DO SO.

920
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

921
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000

922
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000

YOU DON'T HUNT DEER WITH THESE

924

AND I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION

925
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TO RESOLVE

926
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
IN THEIR OWN MINDS WHERE SHOULD

927
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000

HAD HAD AN M-4 IN HER OFFICE

936

937
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
GUNFIRE, SHE PULLS IT OUT AND

938
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO LUNGE

939
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
HEROICALLY WITH NOTHING IN HER

940
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000

1057
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000

1058
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
THAT PEOPLE ARE HO ARE RELIGIOUS

1059
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
FILL THE FULL EMOTIONAL WEIGHT

1060
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
ASSOCIATED WITH TRAGEDY AND THEY

PRAY IN THAT TRAGEDY BECAUSE

1062
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000

1063

1064

THEY FREQUENTLY -- THAT THOSE

1065
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000

HOPE AND CONFIDENCE ACRES

FIRMING THAT GOD HASN'T DESPISED

1069

1070
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
THEM AND ATTENDED TO THEM AND

1071
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
HELPED THEM.
>> THERE IS THAT QUESTION THAT

1072
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
SO MANY PEOPLE ASK AT A TIME

1073
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
LIKE THIS.

1074
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
AND THAT IS HOW COULD THIS

1075
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
HAPPEN?
HOW COULD GOT GOD LESS THIS

1076
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
HAPPEN?
>> NO EASY ANTICIPATE TO THAT

1077
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
QUESTION.
ALL RELIGIONS TRY TO DEAL WITH

1078
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
THE PROBLEM OF SUFFERING AND

1079
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
EVIL ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

1080
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
BUT I THINK THE BIBLE HOLDS

1081
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
PRECIOUS SEVERAL CONVICTIONS.
ONE IS GOD IS WITH US WHEN WE

1082
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
SUFFER.
ANOTHER IS GOD REALLY KNOWS OUR

1083
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
SUFFERING, LISTENENS TO IT, SEE

1084
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
IT IS, EXPERIENCES IT, SOMEHOW

1085
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
HELP US THROUGH IT MAYBE

1086
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
PRECISELY THROUGH THESE TOOLS OF

1087
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
PRAYER AND TEXTS LIKE THE

1088
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
PSALMS, BUT THERE ARE TWO OTHER

1089
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
THINGS I THINK THE BIBLE IS

1090
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
HELPFUL ON IN THIS POINT.

1091
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
ONE IS THAT THE BIBLE CONTAINS

1092
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
THE HOPE THAT ONE DAY YOU GOD

1093
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
WILL SET THE WORLD STRAIGHT.

1094
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
AND IT'S EXACTLY EVENTS LIKE

1095
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
THIS THAT LEAD TO THAT

1096
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
CONVICTION AND THAT HOPE THAT WE
