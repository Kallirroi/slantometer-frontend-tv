HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR, DAN

MALLOY, SAYS THE 20-YEAR-OLD

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
SUSPECT SHOT HIS WAY INTO THE

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000

WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT ALL 20

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
OF THE CHILDREN KILLED INSIDE

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
WERE SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
ALL OF THEM WERE SIX AND SEVEN

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
YEARS OLD.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE STILL

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
PROCESSING THE CRIME SCENE.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
PHYSICALLY AND FORENSICALLY.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
POLICE SAY THEY EXPECT ALL

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
QUESTIONS SURROUNDING THE CASE

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
WILL ULTIMATELY BE ANSWERED

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
BECAUSE THEY HAVE FOUND CERTAIN

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
EVIDENCE.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE IS

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000

EXPECTED TO BE HELD THIS WEEK.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000

EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES TO THE

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
VICTIM'S FAMILIES.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
QUOTE, WE'RE IN A STATE OF

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
DISBELIEF.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
TRYING TO FIND WHATEVER ANSWERS

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
WE CAN.

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
WE, TOO, ARE ASKING WHY.

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
WE'VE COOPERATED FULLY WITH LAW

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
ENFORCEMENT AND WILL CONTINUE TO

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
DO SO WE'RE SADDENED, BUT

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
STRUGGLING TO MAKE SENSE OF WHAT

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
HAS TRANSPIRED.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
WE'RE GOING TO GO TO DON LEMON

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
IN NEWTOWN.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
SO MUCH GOING ON.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
SO DIFFICULT, EVEN FOR THE

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
FATHER TO HAVE TO PUT IN CONTEXT

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
THAT ALLEGEDLY HIS SON IS THE

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
ONE WHO CAUSED SO MUCH GRIEF AND

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
SO MUCH PAIN FOR ALL OF THESE

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
FAMILIES, TARGETING AN

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
>> YEAH, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
IT'S REALLY UNBEARABLE TO THINK

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
ABOUT, DEB, A SON GETTING GUNS

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
FROM HIS OWN HOME AND GOING ON A

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
KILLING RAMPAGE.

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
OUR BRIAN TODD WHO WENT OUT AND

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
SPOKE WITH SOME PEOPLE WHO KNOW
THE SHOOTING SUSPECT.

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
>> HIS MOTIVE FOR THIS

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
UNSPEAKABLE ACT IS STILL NOT

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
CLEAR.
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SAY.

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
AND IN DIGGING FOR DETAILS ABOUT

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
SHOOTER ADAM LANZA AND HIS

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
FAMILY.
ACCOUNTS EMERGE THAT ARE STILL

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
CONFUSING, SOMETIMES
CONFLICTING.

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
A NEIGHBOR WHO KNEW HIM IN

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
RECENT YEARS DESCRIBES LANZA AS

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
TROUBLED.
BUT LISTEN TO THIS ACCOUNT FROM

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
A YOUNG MAN WHO KNEW HIM.

81
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
>> HE WAS JUST A KID.

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
>> JUST A KID.

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
>> JUST A KID.

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
>> NEVER ANTI-SOCIAL?

85
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
>> NO, ADAM, NO.

86
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
>> TROUBLE-MAKE CENTRE.

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
>> NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

88
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
>> NOTICEABLE?

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
DID HE JUST KIND OF BLEND INTO

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
THE BACKGROUND?

91
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
>> YEAH.

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
NOTHING THAT WOULD WARRANT ANY

93
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
OF THIS.

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
>> RYAN CRAFT SAYS HE BABYSAT

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
ADAM LANZA ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO

96
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
WHEN LANZA WAS TEN AND CRAFT WAS

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
15.
HE DESCRIBES LANZA AS FOCUSED,

98
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
QUIET, INTROVERTED.

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
HE NEVER SAW EVIDENCE OF

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
VIOLENCE, CRAFT SAYS.

101
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
BUT SAYS LANZA DID THROW THE

102
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
OCCASIONAL TEMPER TANTRUM.

103
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
>> JUST GENERAL STUFF LIKE YOU

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
WOULD HAVE TO PUT HIM TO BED AND

105
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
HE WOULDN'T LIKE THAT.

106
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
OR WE HAD TO STOP WATCHING TV,

107
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
AND HE WOULDN'T LIKE THAT.

108
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
NORMAL STUFF THAT KIDS DO, BUT I

109
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
GUESS AT 10 YEARS OLD, KIDS GET

110
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
OUT OF THAT PHASE, BUT THAT

111
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
WASN'T THE CASE FOR ADAM.

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
>> MOTHER TOLD HIM TO LET RYAN

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
DO WHATEVER HE WANTED.

114
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
BUT AS FOR ADAM --

115
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
>> NANCY ALWAYS ASKED ME TO

116
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
ALWAYS BE WITH HIM IN THE ROOM.

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
NO MATTER WHAT.

118
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
DON'T GO TO THE BATHROOM, DON'T

119
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
EVER LEAVE HIM WITHOUT

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
SUPERVISION.
>> CRAFT SAYS ADAM HAD A

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH

122
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
HIS MOTHER, NANCY.

123
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
SHE HAD SPLIT FROM THE BOY'S

124
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
FATHER, PETE ELANZA, WHO IS TAX

125
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
DIRECTOR AND PRESIDENT OF GEES

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
IFS BUT KRAFT SAYS NANCY LANZA

127
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
WAS AN ENGAGED MOTHER, SETTING

128
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
UP PLAY DATES WITH HER SONS AND

129
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
TAKING PART IN NEIGHBORHOOD

130
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
ACTIVITIES.

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
NEIGHBORS SAY NANCY LANZA

132
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
ENJOYED GARDENING AND HAD TAKEN

133
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
TIME OFF FROM HER JOB IN

134
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
FINANCE.
>> DECORATE THE HOUSE, THE HOUSE

135
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
WAS ALWAYS PRISTINE AND, I MEAN

136
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
SHE WAS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER

137
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
HOUSEWIFE.
>> BUT LIKE HER SON, THERE ARE

138
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
GAPS IN NANCY LANZA'S STORY THAT

139
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
STILL NEED TO BE FILLED IN.

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
SHE OWNED THE WEAPONS THAT ADAM

141
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
LANZA USED IN THE KILLINGS,

142
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
INCLUDING A SEMI AUTOMATIC RIVAL

143
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
AND IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY SHE

144
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
PURCHASED THEM.

GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT

370
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
THE DOOR.

371
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
FREE AGENCY IS GIVEN TO ALL OF

372
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
US TO ACT AND CHOOSE TO DO

373
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
WHATEVER WE WANT AND GOD CAN'T

374
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
TAKE THAT AWAY FROM US.

375
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

376
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
THAT HE WAS GIVEN AND THAT'S

377
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
WHAT HE CHOSE TO DO WITH IT.

378
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
AND I KNOW THAT GOD CAN'T TAKE

379
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
THAT AWAY.

380
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'M NOT MAD.

381
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
BECAUSE I HAVE MY AGENCY TO MAKE

382
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
SURE THAT I USE THIS EVENT TO DO

383
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
WHAT I CAN, TO DO WHATEVER I

384
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
CAN.
TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY

385
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
FAMILY AND MY WIFE AND MY

386
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
DAUGHTERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF.

387
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
AND THAT IF THERE'S ANYTHING

388
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
THATKY DO TO HELP ANYBODY AT ANY

389
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
TIME, ANYWHERE, THAT I WOULD BE

390
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
WILLING TO DO THAT.

391
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT HAPPENED

392
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO SO MANY

393
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN INTO

394
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US.

395
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
BUT SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US

396
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
TO BE BETTER, TO BE MORE

397
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
COMPASSIONATE AND MORE HUMBLE

398
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
PEOPLE.

399
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
>> EMILIE AND HER FAMILY MOVED

400
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
HER TO NEWTOWN FROM UTAH EARLIER

401
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
THIS YEAR AND SHE WILL BE LAID

402
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
TO REST IN UTAH.

403
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
YOU KNOW, THIS SHOOTING AT SANDY

404
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY IS RAISING LOTS

405
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
OF QUESTIONS, INCLUDING HOW FAR

406
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
THE SECOND AMENDMENT EXTENDS THE

407
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
RIGHTS TO BEAR ARMS.

408
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
WE'LL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AFTER

409
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
THE BREAK.

410
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
PEOPLE HAVE DOUBTS
ABOUT TAKING ASPIRIN FOR PAIN.

411
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
BUT THEY HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED

>>> THE SHOOTING HERE IN NEWTOWN

426
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
IS REVIVING DEBATE OVER GUN

427
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
CONTROL AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT

428
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
TO THE CONSTITUTION.

429
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
MOST PEOPLE THINK THEY KNOW WHAT

430
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
IT SAYS.

431
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
THAT IT JUST SAYS, YOU HAVE THE

432
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

433
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
HERE IS THE ACTUAL TEXT.

434
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
IT SAYS A WELL-REGULATED

435
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
MILITIA, BEING NECESSARY TO THE

436
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
SECURITY OF A FREE STATE, THE

437
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO KEEP AND

438
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
BEAR ARMS, SHALL NOT BE

439
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
INFRINGED.

440
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
DEB, THAT'S THE ACTUAL TEXT

441
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
THERE.
>> THAT'S IT.

442
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
AND THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU HEAR

443
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT GUN CONTROL.

444
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
THEY SAY WE RESPECT THE SECOND

445
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
AMENDMENT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO

446
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
THE MORE MILITARY WEAPONS,

447
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
THAT'S WHERE IT GETS A LITTLE

448
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
BIT TRICKIER.
THE TRAGEDY WILL ONCE AGAIN FUEL

449
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
THE DEBATE OVER A RIGHT TO BEAR

450
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
ARMS, HOW MUCH REGULATION SHOULD

451
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
THERE BE, REGARDING THE

452
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
ACCESSIBILITY OF GUNS.

453
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
WE WANT TO BRING IN OUR CNN

454
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
CONTRIBUTOR, FORMER FBI

455
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, TOM FUENTES.

456
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
TOM, NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT

457
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
REMOVING THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

458
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
BUT THERE ARE 310 MILLION

459
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
NONMILITARY WEAPONS IN THE

460
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
UNITED STATES, THAT IS MORE THAN

461
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
ONE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN.

462
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
FIRST OF ALL, IS IT EVEN

463
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
POSSIBLE TO TRY TO LIMIT THE

464
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
WEAPONS THAT ARE OUT THERE.

465
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
HOW DO YOU EVEN DO THAT?

466
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
>> HI, DEBRA.

467
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE.
IT WOULD BE, HAVE TO BE DONE

468
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

469
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RIGHT

470
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
TO BEAR ARMS, YOU KNOW, WE'RE

471
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
REALLY LOOKING AT AN ISSUE

472
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
THAT'S ON THE CONTINUUM.

473
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE A

474
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
SINGLE-SHOT PISTOL ON THE ONE

475
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
END OF THE CONTINUUM AND NUCLEAR

476
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
WEAPONS ON THE OTHER.

477
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
THE RIGHT OF A CITIZEN TO

478
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
POSSESS ARMS, DOES THAT MEAN

479
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
THEY CAN GO OUT AND OBTAIN

480
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND AUTOMATIC

481
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
WEAPONS AND TANKS AND FIREPOWER,

482
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
AIRCRAFT CARRIERS?

483
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
NO.

484
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT AT SOME

485
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
POINT, WE'RE GOING TO CUT YOU

486
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
OFF AND YOU CAN'T HAVE A MOUR

487
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
POWERFUL WEAPON THAN WHAT THE

488
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
GOVERNMENT SAYS.

489
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
BUT THE ARGUMENT NOW IS AT WHAT

490
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
POINT ON THE CONTINUUM TO DO WE

491
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
MAKE THE LIMITATION, DO WE SAY

492
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
YOU CAN HAVE PISTOLS, SHOTGUNS

493
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
AND SINGLE-SHOT RIFLES, YOU

494
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
CANNOT HAVE AN ASSAULT RIFLE, A

495
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
FULLY AUTOMATIC WEAPON.

496
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
WE'RE REALLY DEBATING AT WHAT

497
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
POINT DO WE SAY ENOUGH IS

498
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
ENOUGH.
YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE FIREPOWER

499
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
BEYOND THE CERTAIN POINT ON THE

500
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
CONTINUUM.

501
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
ANOTHER POINT CONSTITUTIONALLY

502
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
FOR ME IS WHEN SECOND AMEND M

503
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
WAS PASSED AS PART OF THE BILL

504
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
OF RIGHTS, YOU DIDN'T HAVE A LOT

505
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

506
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
FIREPOWER OF A MILITIA AND LOCAL

507
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
FARMERS WITH THEIR MUSKETS AND

508
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
LET'S SAY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AT

509
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
THE TIME OR THE BRITISH

510
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
GOVERNMENT BEFORE THEM.

511
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
WHO HAD BASICALLY MUSKETS AND

512
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
CANNONS AND NOT MUCH MORE THAN

513
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
THAT.

514
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
AGAIN, THE ABILITY OF THE

515
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
POPULATION TO HAVE SOME KIND OF

516
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
A PARODY TO FEND OFF TYRANNY,

517
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO IT.

518
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
EVEN AS WE WON THE REVOLUTIONARY

519
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
WAR WITH MUSKETS AND CANNONS.

520
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
BUT TODAY, ARE THE CITIZENS

521
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
GOING TO PREVENT THE TYRANNY OF

522
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

523
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
WITH EVEN THIS BUSHMASTER OR

524
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
THESE PISTOLS WHEN THE

525
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
GOVERNMENT HAS GOT NUKES?

526
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I DON'T THINK SO.

527
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
TIMES HAVE CHANGED IN 250 YEARS

528
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
AND IT REALLY IS TIME TO MIKE AN

529
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
ASSESSMENT OF WHAT IS REASONABLE

530
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
UNDER THE SECOND AMENDMENT FOR

531
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT

532
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
THEMSELVES.
BUT NOT HAVE SUCH A

533
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS THAT

534
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
THEY REPEATEDLY FALL IN THE

535
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
HANDS OF MENTALLY DISTURBED

536
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
PEOPLE WHO COMMIT THESE ACTS,

537
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
WITH FAR TOO MUCH FREQUENCY ANY

538
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
MORE.

539
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
>> AS WERE YOU SAYING THAT, TOM,

540
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
YOU TOOK THE WORDS RIGHT OUT OF

541
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
MY MOUTH.

542
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
THAT WAS IN THE CONSTITUTION,

543
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
WHEN THEY PUT THAT IN THE

544
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
CONSTITUTION.
MUSKETS, PEA SHOOTERS, NO ONE

545
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
THOUGHT ABOUT ALL OF THESE GUNS.

546
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
THEY PROBABLY HAD NO IDEA WHAT

547
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
THESE EXTENDED MAGAZINES, THAT

548
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
KILL PEOPLE AT RANDOM.

549
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
JUST A MATTER OF MOMENTS.

550
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
AND SO REALLYI THE

551
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
INTERPRETATION OF THAT.
