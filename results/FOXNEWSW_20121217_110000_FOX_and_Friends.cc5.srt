WAS THE HARDEST, TOUGHEST DAY

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
OF HIS PRESIDENCY.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
TODAY IT CONTINUES WITH TWO OF

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
EVEN THOUGH HE'S DONE IT FOUR

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
TIMES IT IS NOT EASIER IT IS

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
GETTING HARDER.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
HE SEES HIS KIDS IN THOSE KIDS

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000

HORRIBLENESS.

>> GOOD MORNING GRETCHEN.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TRIP CAME

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
AFTER THE INNOCENT STUDENTS

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
AND TEACHERS WERE KILLED AND

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
ONE DAY BEFORE THE TIGHT-KNIT

>> I AM MINDFUL THAT MERE

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
WORDS CAN'T MATCH THE DEPTHS

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
OF YOUR SORROW, NOR CAN THEY

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
HEAL YOUR WOUNDED HEARTS.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT IT HELPS

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
ALONE IN YOUR GRIEF AND THAT

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
OUR WORLD, TOO, HAS BEEN TORN

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
APART.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA MET PRIVATE

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
LOW IN CLASSROOMS WITH

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
FAMILIES OF THE 26 INNOCENT

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES ON

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
FRIDAY.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
THE PRINCIPAL'S DAUGHTER

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
TWEETED A PHOTO.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
MY MOM WOULD BE SO PROUD TO

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
SEE PRESIDENT OBAMA TO HOLD

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
HER GRAND DAUGHTER.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
BUT NOT AS PROUD AS I AM OF

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
HER.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
EMILY PARKER'S FAMILY SHOWED

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
SOMBER MOMENTS OF THE DEMANDER

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
IN CHIEF AND OTHER MILES.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
WE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT ADAM

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
LANZA VISITED ONE GUN RANGE

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
AND FIRED HUNDREDS OF SHOTS .

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL USE POWER

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
TO MAKE SURE THIS NEVER

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
HAPPENS AGAIN.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
>> WE SAY WE ARE TRULY DOING

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
ENOUGH TO GIVE ALL OF THE

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
CHILDREN OF THIS COUNTRY THE

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
CHANCE THEY DESERVE TO LIVE

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
OUT THEIR LIVES WITH HAPPINESS

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
AND PURPOSE.

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'VE BEEN REFLECTING ON THIS

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THE LAST FEW DAYS AND IF WE

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
ARE HONEST WITH OURSELVES, THE

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
ANSWER IS NO.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE A CALL

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
TO ACTION THAT WAS RECEIVED

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
WELL BY THE TOWNS PEOPLE.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
THEY WERE EMOTIONAL IN THE

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
PRAYERS AND SPEECHES.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
ONE MAN SAID HE HOPES

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL FOLLOW

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
THROUGH TO MAKE SURE SOMETHING

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
THAT HAPPENED HERE ON FRIDAY

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
>> Peter: IT IS TIME TO TAKE

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
THE MASS OUT OF MASS MURDER .

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
>> Gretchen: SO MANY ISSUES TO

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
DISCUSS.
VILEN VIDEO GAMES AND MENTAL

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
ILLNESS AND GUN CONTROL AND I

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
MEAN.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
>> Peter: THE TELEVISION AND

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
CULTURE ITSELF.

125
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
IT IS HARDENED.

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
>> Gretchen: WE DON'T KNOW

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
WHAT THE ANSWER IS IF IT IS A

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
CONGLOMERATION OF THEM.

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
THERE IS AN AMAZING STORY OF

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
MANY THAT IS COMING OUT OF THE

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
ONE PARTICULAR FIRST GRADE

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
CLASS WHERE EVERY 15 CHILD

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
EXCEPT FOR ONE LITTLE GIRL .

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
HOW DOES A SIX YEAR OLD LITTLE

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
GIRL HAVE THE UNDERSTANDING TO

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
PLAY DEAD AND PRETEPPED SHE

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
WAS SHOT AND DEAD SO THAT THE

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
SHOOTER WILL LEAVE HER ALONE.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
THAT'S WHAT ONE SIX YEAR OLD

140
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
DID AND THEIR FAMILY IS

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
FEELING SURVIVOR GUILT BUT SHE

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
IS ALIVE.

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
>> Brian: SHE WALKED OUT FROM

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
THE BUILDING WITH BLOOD ON HER

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
SHE SAID I AM ALIVE BUT MY

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
FRIENDS ARE DEAD.

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
>> Peter: THE STORY WAS

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
REVEALED WHEN THE MOTHER

150
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
ATTENDED A GRIEF-COUNSELING

151
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
SESSION .

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
ADAM LANZA AND HIS MOTHER

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
NANCY.

155
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THERE IS A STORY APPARENTLY

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
SHE WAS A DOTING MOTHER.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
THERE HE IS FROM THE TECH CLUB

158
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
YEAR BOOK PICTURE.

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
HE WAS 20 YEARS OLD AND SHE

160
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
WAS TRYING TO HELP HIM BUILD A

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
LIFE FOR HIMSELF .

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
THEY WERE CONSIDERING A MOVE

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
FOR A NEWTOWN FOR COLLEGE .

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
YOU HEARD HE WAS A NEAR

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
GENIUS.
THE THEORY WAS HE WAS LOOKING

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
AT ENGINEERING SCHOOLS AND

167
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
PERHAPS THEY HAD VISITED SOME

168
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
IN THE CAROLINAS AND AND SHE

169
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
WAS READY TO MOVE WITH HIM AND

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
HELP AIM ADAPT AND ADOPT A

171
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
NEWTOWN.
>> Brian: SHE HAD TOLD A

172
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
FRIEND IN A SPORTS BAR.

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
SHE WASENDLESSLY UPBEAT.

174
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
HE WAS BURNING HIMSELF WITH A

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
LIGHTER .

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
HE COULD NOT FEEL PHYSICAL

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
PAIN AND WAS BURNING HIMSELF

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
WITH A LIGHTER WITH ARMS AND

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
ANKLES AND SHE FEEL SHE ALWAYS

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
TALKED ABOUT THE OTHER ONE BUT

181
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
NOT HIM.

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE KILLING

183
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
SHE SAID HE TOOK A PHOTOCOPY

184
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
CALL AND SHE QUICKLY CHANGED

185
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
THE SUBJECT.

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
>> HE WOULD GET NERVOUS AND

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
HIS FACE WOULD TURN BRIGHT RED

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
AND HE WOULD GET FIDGETY.

189
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO

190
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000

>> AS AWFUL AS THE TRAGEDY

386

CAN TELL YOU THAT IS THE

398
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
QUESTION OF THE DAY.

399
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
THEY ARE DOING A HISTORICAL

400
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
ANALYSIS REGARDING ADAM LANZA

401
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000

402
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
HE BECAME THE TICKING TIME

403
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
BOMB.

404
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I BELIEVE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE

405
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
IN THE COMMUNITY WAS FAMILIAR

406
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
WITH ADAM LANZA.

407
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
THE QUESTION IS WHY DID HE GO

408
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
TO THE SCHOOL?

409
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I THINK HE KILLED HIS MOTHER

410
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
BECAUSE HE FELT LIKE I THINK

411
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
HE FELT HIS MOTHER BETRAYED

412
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
HIM.
THE MOTHER SAID SHE FELT SHE

413
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
WAS LOSING HIM.

414
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH

415
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
SOMEONE WHO HAS MENTAL ISSUES.

416
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
HE WAS A MAJOR THREAT TO

417
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
OTHERS.
>> Peter: THIS IS REPORTED

418
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
TODAY.

419
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
APPARENTLY THE MOTHER AND SON

420
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
WERE CONSIDERING TO LEAVE TOWN

421
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
AND GOING TO A NEWTOWN FOR HIM

422
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
TO GO TO A ENGINEERING SCHOOL.

423
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
WHAT IF SHE WAS PUSHING HIM TO

424
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
GIT OUT ON HIS OWN.

425
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000

426

HOE DIDN'T WANT TO MOVE.

427
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
>> THATAGITATED HIM.

428
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
A PERSON THAT IS MENAL LOW

429
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
UNSTABLE DOESN'T WANT TO BE

430
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
TOLD WHAT TO DO OR WHERE TO

431
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
GO.

432
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
AND EVEN IF THE MOTHER WAS

433
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
TRYING TO GET THIS GUY THROUGH

434
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
THE COWERS TO BE PSYCHOLOGICAL

435
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
EVALUATED.

436
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL

437
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
OFFICERS BECAUSE HE WAS A

438
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
DANGER .

439
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
HE WAS GOING DOWN THAT PATH

440
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
QUICKLY.
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY THOUGHT

441
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
AT ANY POINT HE WOULD TAKE IT

442
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
TO THIS LEVEL.

443
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
AND THE OTHER QUESTION THAT

444
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
POLICE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE

445
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
OUT WHERE DID HE GET THE

446
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
AMMUNITION AND HOW DID HE

447
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
ACQUIRE IT?

448
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
>> NOT SOLD TO HIM.

449
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
WHO SOLD IT TO HIS MOM .

450
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
>> IF IT WAS SOLD TO HIS MOM .

451
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
WHY WOULD HIS MOTHER HAVE SO

452
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
MUCH AMMUNITION?
I WOPPEDER IF THEY SOLD IT TO

453
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
HIM?
THE GRIM REALITY HE HAD NO

454
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
CRIMINAL HISTORY AND BELIEVE

455
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
IT OR NOT, BASED ON THE

456
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
SITUATION RIGHT NOW .

457
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
HE COULD HAVE WENT OUT AND

458
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
BOUGHT HIS OWN HANDGUNS

459
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
WITHOUT BEING STOPPED.

460
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
SO THAT IS WHAT IS REALLY

461
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
SCARY.

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
THIS YEAR.

741
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
SHE HAD INCREASED SECURITY AT

742
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
THIS SCHOOL.

743
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS,

744
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
BRIAN AND STEVE, MY KID'S

745
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN SENDING A

746
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
LOT OF E-MAILS.

747
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
WE ALSO LIVE IN CONNECTICUT

748
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
ABOUT WHAT IS THE NEW PLAN OF

749
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
ACTION NOW.

750
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD?

751
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
WE'LL HAVE ARMED SECURITY

752
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
GUARDS OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL

753
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
FOR TWO WEEKS.

754
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
HOW LONG DOES THAT LAST.

755
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
DO WE HAVE THE FUNDING OR DOES

756
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
IT MAKE SENSE CULTURALLY TO DO

757
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
THAT MOVING FORWARD.

758
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
THERE IS IT A LOT OF CALLS

759
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
FROM FORMER EDUCATION BILL

760
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
BENNETT.

761
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
TEACHERS SHOULD BE ARMED IN

762
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
THE SCHOOLS.
WHAT IS THE ANSWER HERE.

763
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
WHAT HAVE WE COME TO?

764
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I AM NOT SURE ANY OF US WILL

765
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
>> Peter: THE PRESIDENT OF THE

766
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
UNITED STATES SAID THIPPINGS

767
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
HAVE GOT TO CHANGE.

768
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
WE ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO

769
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

770
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
IF ANYTHING GOOD COMES OUT OF

771
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN SANDY HOOK,

772
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
IT WILL NOT JUST BE A DIALOGUE

773
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL.

774
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
THERE IS A LOT OF GUN LAWS ON

775
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
THE BOOKS AND THEY ARE UNEVEN.

776
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
>> Brian: AND NOT ENFORCED.

777
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
MR. #1: AND NOT JUST THE GUNS,

778
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
BUT A LARGER DISCUSSION OF HOW

779
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
TO STOP GLORIFYING VIOLENCE IN

780
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
VIDEO GAMES AND TELEVISION

781
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
SHOWS AND MOVIES AS WELL.

782
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I GOT A FEELING WE ARE AT A

783
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
TIPPING POINT.
>> Brian: THEY HAD EVERY

784
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY GUNS ARE

785
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
THE PROBLEM.

786
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
AND HE'S NOT.

787
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
AND THE WAY IN WHICH HE'S

788
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
APPROACHING THIS IS

789
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
PHENOMENAL.

790
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
WE GO AND KEEP POLITICS OUT OF

791
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
IT AND COME UP WITH THE BEST

792
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
SOLUTIONS POSSIBLE.

793
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
YOU HARDEN THE TARGET.

794
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
>> Gretchen: STEVE BRINGS UP

795
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
THE TIPPING POINT.

796
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
HOW DO YOU REVERSE THAT WITH

797
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
OUR KIDS NOW?

798
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
THEY ARE SO ENTRENCHED IN THE

799
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
CULTURE OF VIDEO GAMES AND

800
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
SMACKING DOWN THIS AND THAT.

801
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
AS PARENTS, YOU INSTEAD THE

802
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
VALUES OF LOAF FOR YOUR KIDS

803
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
TO BE GOOD PEOPLE.

804
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
AND YOU ARE EXPOSED TO THAT

805
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
24-7.

806
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
HOW DO YOU ROLL IT BACK.

807
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
>> Brian: EVERYBODY WANTED TO

808
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
BE A COWBOY.

809
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
>> Peter: NOW VIDEO GAMES ARE

810
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
SO GRAPHIC AND REALISTIC.

811
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SHOWS

812
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
ON TELEVISION IS NCIS.

813
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
AND YOU GO AN HOUR WITHOUT

814
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
SOMEONE GETTING SHOT IN THE

815
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
FACE OR BLOWN UP OR

816
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
DISMEMBERED AND DISBOWELED

817
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
WITHIN AN HOUR.

818
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
>> Gretchen: MY KIDS ARE 7-9

819
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
AND I DECIDED TO SAY SOMETHING

820
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
TO THEM ABOUT IT AND IT IS

821
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
INTERESTING TO SEE CHILDREN

822
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
AND REACTION .

823
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
THEY WERE SAD, BUT I DON'T

824
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
KNOW IF THEY GET IT AT THAT

825
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
AGE, YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE

826
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
THEM TOO MANY DETAILS.

827
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
>> Brian: THEY ARE IN A STAGE

828
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
OF MAGICAL FEELING.

829
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
YOU ARE AT A LOSS OF HOW MUCH

830
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
YOU SAY .
IT IS VERY, VERY IT IS TOUGH

831
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
TO KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO YOUR

832
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
KIDS .

833
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
>> Peter: WHEN MY KIDS WERE.

834
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I NEVER TOLD THEM THERE WAS NO

835
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000

836
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000

YOUR WOUNDED HEARTS.

1288
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I CAN ONLY HOPE IT HELPS FOR YOU

1289
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN

1290
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
YOUR GRIEF.

1291
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
OUR WORLD, TOO, HAS BEEN TORN

1292
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
APART.

1293
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
>> BEFORE HIS NATIONAL ADDRESS,

1294
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA MET PRIVATELY

1295
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
WITH FAMILIES OF THE INNOCENT

1296
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
CHILDREN AND ADULTS WHO LOST

1297
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
THEIR LIVES ON FRIDAY.

1298
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
PRINCIPAL DAWN HOCHSPRUNG'S

1299
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
DAUGHTER TWEET ADD PHOTO WITH A

1300
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
CAPTION THAT SAID, MY MOM WOULD

1301
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
BE SO PROUD TO SEE PRESIDENT

1302
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
OBAMA HOLDING HER GRANDDAUGHTER

1303
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,000
BUT NOT AS PROUD AS I AM OF HER.

1304
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
THE HEART BROKEN FAMILY OF EMILY

1305
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
PARKER POSTED PHOTOS.

1306
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
OTHERS SHOWING SMILES.

1307
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
AFTER THE PRIVATE MEETING,

1308
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK THE STAGE

1309
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
TO PROMISE ACTION.

1310
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
>> IN THE COMING WEEKS, I'LL USE

1311
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE HOLDS

1312
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
TO ENGAGE MY FELLOW CITIZENS

1313
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, TO MENTAL

1314
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO PARENTS

1315
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
AND EDUCATORS IN AN EFFORT AIMED

1316
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
AT PREVENTING MORE TRAGEDIES

1317
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
LIKE THIS.
>> AS FOR THE STATUS OF THE

1318
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
INVESTIGATION, WE NOW KNOW THAT

1319
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
ADAM LANZA FIRED HUNDREDS OF

1320
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
SHOTS, HUNDREDS INSIDE SANDY

1321
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
HOOK ELEMENT TEAR SCHOOL SCHOOL

1322
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
ON FRIDAY AND HE VISITED AT

1323
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
LEAST ONE GUN RANGE WITH HIS

1324
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
MOTHER ACTION ALTHOUGH AT THIS

1325
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
TIME THEY CAN NOT SAY WHETHER OR
NOT HE ACTUALLY FIRED ANY

1326
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
WEAPONS WHILE HE WAS AT THAT

1327
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
RANGE.
BACK TO YOU IN NEW YORK.

1328
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
>> Steve: THANK YOU.

1329
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
>> Brian: WE KNOW THIS GUY IS

1330
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
THE UTTER DEFINITION OF A LONER.

1331
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
WE KNOW HE WAS EMOTIONALLY

1332
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
DISABLED.
>> Steve: ALTHOUGH A NEAR

1333
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
GENIUS.

1334
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
>> Brian: HE HAD A MEDICAL
CONDITION AND COULD NOT FEEL

1335
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
PAIN.
THEY SAY THAT HE LOVED VIDEO

1336
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
GAMES.

1337
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
ONE GAME IN PARTICULAR, I DON'T
KNOW ANY OF THEM, BUT CALLED

1338
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
DYNASTY WARRIORS.

1339
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
HIS MOM TOOK HIM SHOOTING MORE

1340
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
THAN ONCE.

1341
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
BUT OTHER REPORTS WERE SHE TOOK

1342
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
HIM OFTEN.
THE NEIGHBORS SAY HE WAS HOME

1343
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
SCHOOLED AND THAT SHE, IN FACT,

1344
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
DEVOTED HER LIFE TO HIM, BUT

1345
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
THAT ONE CONVERSATION AT A

1346
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
SPORTS BAR THAT SHE HAD WITH

1347
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
SOMEBODY A FEW DAYS AGO SAYING I

1348
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
FEEL LIKE I'M LOSING HIM AND I

1349
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
FEEL LIKE HE'S SLIPPING AWAY.

1350
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
THAT WAS AN INDICATION THAT THEY

1351
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
WERE AT A TIPPING POINT.

1352
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
>> Gretchen: APPARENTLY WHEN SHE

1353
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
WOULD HAVE BABY-SITTERS TAKE

1354
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
CARE OF HIM, SHE WOULD SAY TO

1355
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
THEM, YOU CAN NOT EVEN LEAVE HIM

1356
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
ALONE EVEN TO GO TO THE

1357
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
RESTROOM.
SO SHE WAS DEVOTED TO THIS

1358
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
CHILD.
THERE ARE GOING TO BE A LOT OF

1359
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
QUESTIONS, THOUGH, ABOUT SO MANY

1360
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
THINGS WITH THIS INCIDENT.

1361
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,000
BUT ALSO JUST ABOUT THE WAY IN

1362
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
WHICH HE WAS ALLOWED TO PLAY

1363
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
THESE VIDEO GAMES AND LEARN HOW

1364
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
TO SHOOT GUNS AND THE ACCESS TO

1365
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
THE GUNS.

1366
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
ONE OF HIS CLASSMATES SPOKES TO

1367
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
"60 MINUTES LAST NIGHT.

1368
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
>> HE JUST WOULD GET VERY

1369
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
NERVOUS AND HIS FACE WOULD TURN

1370
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
BRIGHT RED AND HE WOULD GET VERY

1371
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
FIDGETY.

1372
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
YOU COULD JUST TELL THAT HE

1373
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
WASN'T THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW THE

1374
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
ANSWER.

1375
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO

1376
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
SAY WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY.

1377
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
HE MUST HAVE REALLY FELT

1378
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
UNCOMFORTABLE IN ANY KIND OF

1379
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
SOCIAL SITUATION BECAUSE HE

1380
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
UNFORTUNATE REALLY PUT HIMSELF

1381
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
OUT THERE AND I JUST DON'T

1382
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
REALLY REMEMBER HIM EVER

1383
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
STEPPING FORWARD OR REALLY

1384
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
SAYING ANYTHING.

1385
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
IT WAS JUST HE WANTED TO BE LEFT

1386
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
ALONE AND WE LEFT HIM ALONE.

1387
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
>> Steve: APPARENTLY AS EARLY AS

1388
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
MIDDLE SCHOOL, HE WAS IDENTIFIED

1389
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
BY SECURITY OFFICERS AT HIS

1390
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
SCHOOL AS SOMEBODY TO WATCH AND

1391
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
THEN WHEN HE WENT TO HIGH

1392
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
SCHOOL, HE HAD A PERMANENT

1393
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
PSYCHOLOGIST ASSIGNED TO HIM TO

1394
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

1395
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
THEY WERE WORRIED THAT NOT THAT

1396
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
HE WOULD BE VIOLENT U ABOUT BE A

1397
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
VICTIM.

1398
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
ALSO APPARENTLY IN THE WEEKS

1399
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
LEADING UP TO THE RAMPAGE, HE

1400
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
AND HIS MOTHER HAD BEEN TALKING

1401
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
A LOT ABOUT THE NEXT STAGE IN

1402
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
HIS LIFE.
HE WAS 20 YEARS OLD.

1403
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
SHE WAS TRYING TO HELP HIM

1404
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
ESTABLISH A LIFE AND MAYBE MOVE

1405
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
TO A NEW TOWN, MAYBE GO TO A

1406
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
COLLEGE TO STUDY ENGINEERING

1407
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
BECAUSE HE WAS BRIGHT.

1408
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
AND SHE WAS READY TO GO WITH HIM

1409
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
TO MOVE WITH HIM, SO THEY

1410
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
VISITED SOME COLLEGES AND LOOKED

1411
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
INTO VARIOUS LIVING SITUATION.

1412
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
THE BIG QUESTION IS, WHAT IF HE

1413
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
DIDN'T WANT TO GO.

1414
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
WHAT IF IT WAS SIMPLY THE MOTHER

1415
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
PUSHING HIM TO MOVE ON WITH HIS

1416
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
LIFE AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO?

1417
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
>> Gretchen: WHAT ABOUT MENTAL
ILLNESS IN OUR SOCIETY,  WHICH

1418
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
IS A WHOLE NOTHER ISSUE ABOUT

1419
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
IT'S VERY, VERY, VERY DIFFICULT

1420
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
TO GET PEOPLE HELP BASED ON

1421
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
MENTAL ILLNESS AND I'M SURE MANY

1422
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
OF YOU OUT THERE HAVE

1423
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
EXPERIENCED THIS, MAYBE IN YOUR

1424
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
OWN FAMILY OR NOT.

1425
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
THAT'S ALSO GOING TO BECOME A

1426
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
CENTRAL.

1427
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
>> Brian: IT COULD HAVE BEEN

1428
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
WORSE.
HE HAD MORE AMMO AND IF THE

1429
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
NURSE RESPONDERS DIDN'T GET

1430
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
THERE, EVIDENTLY THE REPORTS ARE

1431
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
THAT AS SOON AS HE SAW THE COPS

1432
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
ENTER, THAT'S WHEN HE BLEW HIS

1433
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
HEAD OFF.
IF HE DIDN'T, THERE WAS MORE

1434
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.

1435
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
>> Steve: ABSOLUTELY.
AND THERE ARE STORIES THIS

1436
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
MORNING THAT APPARENTLY HIS

1437
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
MOTHER, NANCY, TOOK HIM TO THE

1438
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
FIRE RANGES TO BOND WITH HIM.

1439
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
HE WAS SOCIALLY AWKWARD AND SHE

1440
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
FELT THAT'S A WAY TO DO IT.

1441
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
SHE NEVER MENTIONED TO FRIENDS

1442
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
THAT'S VIOLENT AND SHE WAS NEVER

1443
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
AFRAID OF HIM AND YET, ON FRIDAY

1444
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
MORNING, HE WOKE UP, WENT INTO

1445
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
HER BEDROOM WHILE SHE WAS STILL

1446
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
IN THE BED, AND SHOT HER IN THE

1447
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
HEAD FOUR TIMES.

1448
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
>> Gretchen: NOW LAWMAKERS

1449
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
CRAFTING NEW GUN LEGISLATION.

1450
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
DOUG IS LIVE WITH MORE ON THAT.

1451
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
GOOD MORNING.

1452
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
>> YEAH.

1453
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
THIS OLD DEBATE HAS BEEN GIVEN

1454
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
NEW LIFE HERE IN WASHINGTON

1455
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
WHERE WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE SOME

1456
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
PIECES OF LEGISLATION ADVANCE

1457
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
DEALING WITH GUN CONTROL,

1458
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
PERHAPS IN THE NEXT CONGRESS.

1459
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
AS THE PRESIDENT SPOKE AT THAT

1460
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
MEMORIAL ADDRESS LAST NIGHT IN

1461
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
CONNECTICUT, HE DIDN'T

1462
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
SPECIFICALLY MENTION GUN

1463
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
CONTROL, BUT HE DID SAY THAT THE

1464
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
NATION SHOULD DO MORE TO PROTECT

1465
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
THE NATION'S CHILDREN AND IN THE

1466
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
WAKE OF THE ATTACK, HE IS GOING

1467
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
TO FACE PLENTY MUCH PRESSURE

1468
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
FROM HIS SUPPORTERS TO CRACK

1469
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
DOWN ON GUNS.

1470
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
>> IT'S TIME FOR THE PRESIDENT,

1471
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I THINK, TO STAND UP AND LEAD

1472
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
AND TELL THIS COUNTRY WHAT WE

1473
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
SHOULD DO.

1474
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
NOT GO TO CONGRESS AND SAY WHAT

1475
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
YOU GUYS WANT TO DO.

1476
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
>> I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE IN THE

01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000

1478
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
INTRODUCED IN THE HOUSE, A BILL

1479
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS.

1480
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
>> THE RESPONSE FROM DEFENDERS

1481
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT HAS BEEN

1482
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
SOMEWHAT MUTED IN THE IMMEDIATE

1483
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
AFTERMATH, BUT SOME POINT OUT

1484
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
THAT GUNS ARE JUST ONE PART OF

1485
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
THE EQUATION HERE.

1486
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
ONE OTHER FREQUENT COMPONENT OF

1487
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS IS MENTAL

1488
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
ILLNESS AND HOW THE NATION DEALS

1489
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
WITH THE MENTALLY ILL WILL NO

1490
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
DOUBT BE PART OF THE

1491
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
CONVERSATION.

1492
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
>> WE ALSO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

1493
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
NEW SOCIAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THE

1494
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
BOMBARDMENT AND THE IMMEDIACY OF

1495
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
SOCIAL INTERACTION BETWEEN

1496
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
VIOLENCE, THE REALISM THAT YOU

1497
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
FIND IN GAMES AND MOVIES.

1498
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
MAKING THIS TRANSITIONPEOPLE AS

1499
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
FROM TEEN YEARS INTO ADULTHOOD

1500
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
AREN'T ABLE TO MENTALLY MAKE

1501
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
THAT TRANSEXCISION THERE DOES

1502
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
NEED TO BE HELP AND WE ALSO NEED

1503
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
TO LOOK TO FAMILIES AND

1504
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
COMMUNITIES AND CHURCHES.

1505
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
IT'S NOT JUST THE GOVERNMENT

1506
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
SOLUTION.
>> THE OTHER ASPECT HOW DO YOU

1507
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
IDENTIFY THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT

1508
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
MAY BE NOT JUST A DANGER TO

1509
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
THEMSELVES, BECAUSE DANGER TO

1510
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL?

1511
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION.

1512
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
THE SHOOTER IN THIS CASE

1513
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
APPARENTLY DID NOT HAVE A

1514
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
CRIMINAL RECORD.
BACK TO YOU GUYS.

1515
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
>> Steve: DOUG LIVE IN DC, THANK

1516
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
YOU.
>> Gretchen: WE HEARD JASON

1517
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
CHAFFETZ TALK ABOUT CHURCH AND

1518
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
THE RESPONSIBILITY THERE.

1519
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
YESTERDAY I HAVE TO SAY AT MY

1520
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
CHURCH IN CONNECTICUT, FIRST

1521
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, PACKED,

1522
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
PACKED.
PEOPLE PROBABLY COMING THERE FOR

1523
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
HOPE.
I WANT TO SHOW THINK PICTURE

1524
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
BECAUSE IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF

1525
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
THE MOST IMPORTANT CHURCH

1526
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
SERVICES THAT I'VE EVER HAD THE

1527
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND.

1528
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE POINSETTIAS

1529
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
FOR CHRISTMAS.
BUT THEN YOU SEE THE LIGHTS UP

1530
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
THERE AT THE FRONT OF THE

1531
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
CHURCH.
THOSE ARE 27 CANDLES THAT WERE

1532
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
ALL LIT AS EACH NAME OF EACH

1533
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
VICTIM, INCLUDING THE SHOOTER,

1534
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
WAS NAMED BY ONE OF OUR

1535
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
MINISTERS.

1536
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
EARLIER BEFORE THE CHILDREN LEFT

1537
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
THE SANCTUARY, THERE WAS A

1538
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
CHILDREN'S SERMON IN WHICH THEY

1539
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
TALKED ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT THE

1540
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
LIGHT OF A CANDLE CAN BE IN THE

1541
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
LIFE OF A CHILD IF YOU HAVE THE

1542
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
OPPORTUNITY TO BELIEVE IN

1543
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
CHRISTIANITY.
THEN THE CHILDREN LEFT THE

1544
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
SERVICE.
I WAS WONDERING WOULD THE

1545
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
MINISTER TALK A LOT ABOUT THE

1546
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
SHOOTING.
HE HAD AN AMAZING SERMON WHERE

1547
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
HE SAID THAT AS A MAN OF GOD

1548
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS, THAT

1549
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
HE WAS INTELLECTUALLY EMPTY AND

1550
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
VACANT AS TO HOW HE COULD

1551
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
RESPOND TO WHAT HAPPENED IN

1552
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1553
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
BUT I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A

1554
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
DISCUSSION ABOUT GOD IN OUR

1555
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
LIVES.
FOR ME, THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST

1556
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
MOVING DAYS OF MY LIFE

1557
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
YESTERDAY, TO SEE THIS AND TO

1558
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
HONOR ALL OF THESE VICTIMS IN

1559
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
THAT WAY.

1560
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
SO HOPEFULLY WHEN YOU ALL WENT

1561
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
TO CHURCH, IF YOU HAD THAT

1562
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
OPPORTUNITY YESTERDAY, YOU HAD

1563
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND SOME

1564
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
HOPE IN YOUR LIFE AS WELL.

01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000

1824
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,000
with its foot-activated
lift gate.

1825
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
But that's not
all you'll see,

1826
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Cause C-MAX also
beats Prius v,

1827
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
with better MPG.

1828
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,000

combined MPG C-MAX Hybrid.

1830

HE'S REPORTEDLY BEING HELD THERE

1838

BY MEMBERS OF A MEXICAN CARTEL

1839
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000

1840

JOHN'S MOTHER, OLIVIA, JOINS ME

1845
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000

1846
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

1847
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000

01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
HAVING ME.

1849
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
>> Gretchen: OF COURSE.

1850
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
WE TALKED TO YOU MAYBE A FEW

1851
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
WEEKS AGO WHEN YOU FIRST DECIDED

1852
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
TO GO PUBLIC WITH THIS STORY.

1853
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
WHAT'S THE LATEST?

1854
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD FROM YOUR

1855
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
SON?
>> I THINK HE IS -- IT'S

1856
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
BECOMING MORE TENUOUS EVERY DAY.

1857
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I THINK THE SITUATION IS MORE

1858
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
DIRE AS BECOMES MORE AND MORE

1859
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
PUBLIC.
I KNOW THAT THE STORY HAS GONE

1860
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
IN SOME OF THE TOP PAPERS IN

1861
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
MEXICO CITY AND IT'S CERTAINLY

1862
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
ALL OVER THE BORDER TOWNS AND

1863
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
THE PAPERS AND HE'S GETTING

1864
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
FEEDBACK, WHY ARE YOU IN THE

1865
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
NEWS?

1866
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

1867
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
WHY DOESN'T YOUR FAMILY JUST

1868
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
PAY?
SO THAT'S SORT OF THE FEEDBACK

1869
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
HE'S GETTING AND IT'S NERVE

1870
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
RACKING.

1871
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
>> Gretchen: IT'S MY
UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE CARTELS

1872
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
RUN SOME OF THE PRISONS IN

1873
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
MEXICO AND THEY HAD BEEN IN

1874
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
TOUCH WITH YOU AND THEY ARE

1875
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
DEMANDING SOME SORT OF A RANSOM?

1876
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
>> THEY DID IN THE VERY

1877
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
BEGINNING.

1878
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
THE CONSUL GOT INVOLVED AND ABLE

1879
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
TO ISOLATE HIM AND THOSE CALLS

1880
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
STOPPED.

1881
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
SO WE HAVEN'T HAD TO DEAL WITH

1882
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
THAT ANYMORE.

1883
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
BUT 90% OF THAT PRISON IS IN

1884
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
THIS GENERAL POPULATION THAT IS

1885
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
CONTROLLED, EVERY ASPECT OF THE

1886
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
GENERAL POPULATION IS CONTROLLED

1887
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
BY THE CARTEL.

1888
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
MOST OF THE GUARDS WON'T EVEN

1889
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
ENTER INTO THAT SECTION OF THE

1890
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
PRISON.

1891
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
>> Gretchen: HOW IS HE BEING

1892
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
TREATED?
WE HAD HEARD REPORTS THAT I

1893
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
THINK HE TOLD YOU DIRECTLY HE

1894
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
WAS BEING CHAIN TO DO A BED.

1895
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
>> EXACTLY.
I THINK IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

1896
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
DAYS THEY HAVE REMOVED THOSE

1897
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
CHAINS JUST BECAUSE OF THE

1898
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
PUBLICITY.

1899
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
I THINK THEY TEND TO PUT THEM ON

1900
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
WHEN VISITING HOURS ARE OVER,

1901
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
BECAUSE THERE ARE VISITING HOURS

1902
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
AND BECAUSE OF WHERE HE'S

1903
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
LOCATED IN THE PRISON, PEOPLE

1904
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
ARE CONSTANTLY WALKING BY THERE

1905
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
AND CAN SEE HIM.

1906
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,000
SO HE HAS A HIGH VISIBILITY.

1907
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
>> Gretchen: INTERESTING THAT

1908
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
THIS PUBLICITY MAY HAVE HELPED.

1909
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I KNOW IT WAS A BIG RISK.

1910
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO A

1911
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000

1912
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
WORKING DILIGENTLY ON YOUR

I INTERVIEWED HER LAST WEEK.

1915
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
>> THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT THE

1916
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT

1917
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
STEPPING IN TO HELP US WHILE

1918
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
THEY TAKE OUR MONEY AND TAKE ALL

THE HELP WE GIVE THEM.

1920
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT OUR OWN

1921
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
U.S. GOVERNMENT IS NOT DOING ALL

1922
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
THAT WE CAN TO BRING HIM HOME

01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000

1924
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
THE FAMILY DESERVES THIS.

1925

IT IS SO UNFAIR AND SO UNJUST,

1927
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
SO WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ON

NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

2003
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
NEW YORK CITY'S TIMES SQUARE

2004
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
FULL OF PEOPLE HOLING CANDLES

2005
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
AND SIGNS.

2006
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
FLAGS FLOWN AT HALF-STAFF AT THE

2007
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000

WITH CROSSES LINING THE BEACH IN

2009
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000

CANDLES ON THE STREETS IN

2014
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
TRIBUTE.
>> Steve: THAT'S NICE.

2015
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
MEANWHILE, BRAND-NEW INFORMATION

2016
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
JUST COMING IN ABOUT ADAM LANZA

2017
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
AND HIS MOTHER, NANCY.

2018
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE HE WENT ON

2019
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
A KILLING SPREE?

2020
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
PEOPLE DOOCY JUST PEOPLE WITH A

2021
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
CONFIDENTANT, A FRIEND OF NANCY

2022
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,000
LANZA AND JOINS US.

2023
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
>> I MET RICH COLLINS LAST NIGHT

2024
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
AT A RESTAURANT CALLED MY PLACE

2025
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
IN NEWTOWN, WHICH WAS ONE OF

2026
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
NANCY LANZA'S FAVORITE PLACES TO

2027
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
GO FORTUNER AND DRINKS.

2028
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
RICH TOLD ME THAT SINCE HE HAS A

2029
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
SON WITH AUTISM AND NANCY HAD A

2030
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
SON, A ASBURGERS, THEY WOULD

2031
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
BOND SOMETIMES ABOUT THE

2032
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
DIFFICULTIES SOMETIMES IN
DEALING WITH THAT.

2033
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,000
LISTEN TO WHAT HE TOLD ME.

2034
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
>> NANCY WOULD GET UPSET BECAUSE

2035
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
HER SON REFUSED TO LET HER TOUCH

2036
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
HIM.
SHE COULDN'T HUG HIM.

2037
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
MY SON IS JUST THE OPPOSITE.

2038
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,000
SHE'D SEE MY SON HANGING ALL

2039
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
OVER ME.

2040
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
BUT AUTISTIC KIDS, EACH AND

2041
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
EVERY ONE OF THEM IS DIFFERENT.

2042
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
>> YOU SAID THAT THERE WERE

2043
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT SHE TRIED

2044
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
TO DO BECAUSE SHE HAD A HARD

2045
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
TIME BONDING WITH HIM?

2046
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
>> YEAH.
SHE WAS TRYING TO BOND, FIND

2047
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
WAYS TO BOND WITH HIM.

2048
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,000
SHE TOLD ME THE GUNS, SHE WOULD

2049
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
TAKE THEM SHOOTING BECAUSE THAT

2050
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
WAS A WAY THAT A SINGLE MOM

2051
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
COULD RELATE TO HER SON.

2052
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
>> RICH COLLINS ALSO TOLD ME

2053
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
THAT HE THINKS NANCY LANZA DID

2054
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
THE BEST SHE COULD, BUT THAT SHE

2055
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
DID NOT HAVE BEING A SINGLE

2056
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
MOTHER, THE SUPPORT SYSTEM

2057
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
NECESSARY FOR DEALING WITH

2058
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:37,000
SOMEONE LOUISORORER -- LIKE

2059
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
ADAM.
THEY'RE SAYING HE FIRED SEVERAL

2060
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
HUNDRED SHOTS INSIDE SANDY HOOK

2061
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

2062
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
AROUND HERE, THERE IS VERY

2063
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
LITTLE FOCUS, SPECIFIC FOCUS ON

2064
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
ADAM LANZA.

2065
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
THERE IS MUCH MORE FOCUS INSTEAD

2066
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,000
ON THE NAMES OF HIS VICTIMS THAT

2067
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA READ ONE AT A

2068
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
TIME LAST NIGHT.

2069
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
BACK TO YOU IN NEW YORK.

2070
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
>> Steve: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

2071
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
>> Brian: SHE DID NOT HAVE MAYBE

2072
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
THE RESOURCES FAMILY WISE, BUT

2073
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
SHE HAD IT FINANCIALLY.

2074
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
>> Steve: SHE DID.

2075
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
>> Brian: SHE WOULD BE ABLE

2076
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
TO -- SHE HAD HEALTH INSURANCE

2077
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
OR COULD AFFORD TO BUY HER OWN.

2078
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
SO THERE WAS SOME ASPECTS TO IT.

2079
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
I'M NOT QUESTIONING HER

2080
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
DEDICATION TO IT.

2081
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
BUT I JUST WONDER ABOUT THE

2082
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
SANITY OF GIVING A KID THAT

2083
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
COULD NOT SHOW AFFECTION OR FEEL

2084
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
PAIN THE ABILITY TO SHOOT A GUN.

2085
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
>> Gretchen: I AGREE WITH YOU

2086
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
ON.
I WILL SAY THAT MENTAL ILLNESS

2087
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
IN OUR SOCIETY IS REALLY,

2088
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET

2089
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
PEOPLE INTO INSTITUTIONS OR

2090
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,000
HOSPITALS OR TO TAKE MEDICATION.

2091
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
THE ACLU HAS FOUGHT HARD ABOUT

2092
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
DOING JUST THAT AND THAT'S ONE

2093
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE SO

2094
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
MANY OF THE HOMELESS PEOPLE ON

2095
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
OUR STREETS WHO ARE MENTALLY

2096
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
ILL.
THIS IS A HUGE NATIONAL

2097
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
DISCUSSION NOW, EVEN TOUGH FOR A

2098
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
MOM TO GET THEIR OWN KID HELP IN

2099
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
MANY, MANY, MANY CASES.

2100
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
>> Brian: A COURT CAN MANDATE

2101
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
THAT YOU TAKE MEDICATION, WE

2102
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:58,000
FOUND OUT OVER THE WEEKEND, EVEN

2103
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,000
UNADULT TAKE MEDICATION IF

2104
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
YOU'RE A DANGER TO SOCIETY.

2105
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
>> Steve: WHY DID HE GO TO SANDY

2106
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

2107
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
THERE WERE STORIES FLOATING

2108
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
AROUND THAT WE THINK HIS MOM WAS

2109
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
AN AID OR VOLUNTEER.

2110
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
SCHOOL SAYS THEY HAVE NO

2111
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
CONNECTION.
THERE HE IS, THAT'S A PICTURE OF

2112
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:23,000
HIM FROM THE TECH CLUB YEARBOOK.

2113
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, ADAM LANZA

2114
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
DID ACTUALLY GO NOT ONLY TO THE

2115
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
HIGH SCHOOL WHERE THEY HAD THE

2116
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
MEMORIAL LAST NIGHT, BUT HE ALSO

2117
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
WENT TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

2118
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
WHAT MADE HIM SNAP?

2119
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
>> Brian: WHY DID HE GO THERE?

2120
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
>> Steve: WHY DID HE GO THERE?

2121
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
ROD WHEELER, FORMER DETECTIVE IN

2122
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
DC JOINED US EARLIER TO GIVE US

2123
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
HIS OPINION OF WHAT MAY HAVE

2124
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
HAPPENED INSIDE THE MAN.

2125
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
>> I BELIEVE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE

2126
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
IN THAT COMMUNITY WERE VERY

2127
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
FAMILIAR WITH ADAM LANZA.

2128
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
THE QUESTION IS WHY DID HE GO TO

2129
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL?

2130
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I THINK SOMEONE AT THE SCHOOL

2131
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
WAS FAMILIAR WITH HIM, TOO.

2132
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
I THINK HE KILLED HIS MOTHER

2133
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
BECAUSE I THINK HE PHYSICAL LIKE

2134
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
HIS MOTHER BETRAYED HIM.

2135
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
A PERSON THAT'S MENTALLY

2136
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
UNSTABLE DOES NOT WANT TO BE

2137
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
TOLD WHAT TO DO OR WHERE TO GO.

2138
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
NOW, EVEN IF THE MOTHER WAS

2139
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:09,000
TRYING TO GET THIS GUY PROBATED

2140
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
THROUGH THE COURTS, IF THE

2141
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
POLICE WOULD HAVE WENT TO GET

2142
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
HIM, TRUST ME, THEY WOULD HAVE

2143
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
TAKEN SEVERAL OFFICERS BECAUSE

2144
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
HE WAS CLEARLY A DANGER.

2145
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
HE WAS GOING DOWN THAT PATH.

2146
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
HE WAS GOING DOWN THAT PATH VERY

2147
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
QUICKLY, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE

2148
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
THAT THEY THOUGHT AT ANY POINT

2149
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
THAT HE WAS GOING TO TAKE IT TO

2150
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
THIS LEVEL.

2151
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,000
>> Steve: YEAH.

2152
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
AND IN FACT, BEFORE FRIDAY, HE

2153
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
HAD ABSOLUTELY NO DISCIPLINARY

2154
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
PROBLEMS ON HIS RECORD, ALTHOUGH

2155
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
THE SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL DID

2156
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
IDENTIFY HIM AS SOMEONE TO KEEP

2157
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
AN EYE ON.

2158
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
THEN IN HIGH SCHOOL, HE HAD A

2159
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
PERMANENT PSYCHOLOGIST ASSIGNED

2160
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
TO HIM THROUGHOUT HIS HIGH

2161
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
SCHOOL CAREER, EVEN THOUGH HE

2162
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
DROPPED OUT FOR HOME SCHOOLING.

2163
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
THEY WERE WORRIED NOT OF

2164
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
VIOLENCE, BUT THAT HE MIGHT

2165
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
ACTUALLY BE THE VICTIM OF

2166
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
SOMEBODY ELSE BULLYING HIM

2167
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
BECAUSE HE WAS SO SOCIALLY

2168
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
AWKWARD.
>> Gretchen: INTERESTING.

2169
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
NOW TO THE REST OF YOUR

2170
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
HEADLINE.
ONE DAY AFTER THE NEWTOWN

2171
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
SHOOTING, A MAN UNDER ARREST FOR

2172
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
THREATENING A DIFFERENT KIND OF

2173
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
A SCHOOL MASSACRE.

2174
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
THIS ONE IN INDIANA.

2175
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
POLICE FOUND 47 GUNS INSIDE

2176
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
VAUGHN MYERS' HOME, NEXT DOOR TO

2177
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,000
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE HIS

2178
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
WIFE WORKS.
DURING A FIGHT, HE ALLEGEDLY

2179
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
THREATENED TO SET HIS WIFE ON

01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
KERRY IS SECRETARY OF STATE.

2358
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
WHAT DOES HE BRING TO THE TABLE?

2359
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
WHO WHAT WILL THE STATE

2360
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
DEPARTMENT LOOK LIKE UNDER HIM?

2361
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,000
>> BRIAN, HE DOES KNOW A LOT OF

2362
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
PEOPLE.

2363
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
HE'S BEEN IN THE SENATE FOR A

2364
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,000
LONG TIME AND ALWAYS INTERESTED

2365
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
IN FOREIGN POLICY.

2366
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:35,000
THAT'S THE PLUS SIDE.

2367
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
ON THE DOWN SIDE, HE'S ALL BEEN

2368
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
RATHER INDECISIVE AS A

2369
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
POLITICIAN.

2370
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
WE ALL REMEMBER THE LINE FROM

2371
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
THE 2004 CAMPAIGN, I VOTED FOR

2372
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
THE 87 BILLION BEFORE

2373
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
AGAINST IT.

2374
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
DURING THE FIRST GULF WAR, HE

2375
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
SENT ONE CONSTITUENT TWO

2376
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,000
SEPARATE LETTERS.

2377
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,000
THE FIRST LETTER HE SAID HE WAS

2378
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
FOR THE WAR AND THE SECOND ONE

2379
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
SAID HE WASN'T.
IF HE COULD TAKE ORDERS, HE

2380
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,000
SHOULD BE OKAY.

2381
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
BUT ANOTHER NEGATIVE IS THAT

2382
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
HE'S A RATHER QUESTIONABLE JUDGE

2383
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,000
OF CHARACTER.

2384
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
HE PINTED JOHN EDWARDS TO BE HIS

2385
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,000
RUNNING MATE IN 2004 AND HE

2386
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,000
GUSHED OVER BASHIR AL ASSAD.

2387
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
HE'S BEEN SILENT EVER SINCE

2388
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:23,000
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN SYRIA.

2389
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
>> Brian: THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

2390
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
HANDS OFF WITH THE STATE

2391
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
DEPARTMENT B. WHO KNOWS.

2392
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SENATE SEAT

2393
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
HE WOULD LEAVE BEHIND.

2394
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
THEY HAVE 160 DAYS TO FILL IT.

2395
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
SCOTT BROWN LOST BY EIGHT.

2396
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
BUT SCOTT BROWN FAVORABLES IN

2397
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,000
MASSACHUSETTS WERE VERY HIGH.

2398
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,000
>> RIGHT.

2399
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT HE WAS

2400
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
ELECTED TO REPLACE TED KENNEDY

2401
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,000
IN A UNIQUE JANUARY ELECTION.

2402
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
THERE WERE ONLY 2.2 MILLION

2403
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
VOTERS TURNED U. THIS PAST

2404
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
NOVEMBER WAS A PRESIDENTIAL

2405
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
YEAR.

2406
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,000
EXTRA MILLION VOTERS TURNED OUT.

2407
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE RUSH CALLS

2408
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
LOW INFORMATION VOTERS.

2409
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
HE BROWN GOT 350,000 MORE VOTES,

2410
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
BUT GOT SWAMPED BY ELIZABETH

2411
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
WARREN.

2412
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:07,000
NIECE PRETTY GOOD SHAPE, UNLESS

2413
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS SOMEBODY

2414
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
AND THERE IS NO PRIMARY.

2415
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
WHAT SCOTT NEEDS IS A DIVISIVE

2416
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY LIKE HE GOT

2417
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
IN 2009 AFTER TED KENNEDY'S

2418
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
DEATH.

2419
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
>> Brian: YOU SAID YOU SPOKE TO

2420
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
HIM LAST NIGHT.

2421
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
WHAT DOES HE SEE AS A SCENARIO

2422
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
THAT COULD HAPPEN, 'CAUSE PEOPLE

2423
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
ARE TALK BEING VICKY KENNEDY,

2424
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
TED KENNEDY'S WIDOW, MAYBE

2425
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
PATRICK PICKING HIMSELF TO RUN.

2426
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
>> I DON'T THINK THAT DuVAL

2427
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
WILL PICK HIMSELF.

2428
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
HE'S BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

2429
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
PEOPLE SPECULATED THAT SHE WOULD

2430
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
BE THE INTERIM SENATOR UNTIL THE

2431
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
PRIMARY COULD BE HELD TO PICK

2432
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
SOMEBODY TO RUN AGAINST SCOTT IN

2433
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
MAY OR JUNE.

2434
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
BUT I THINK WHAT SCOTT AND

2435
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
REPUBLICANS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

2436
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:53,000
IS DUVAL MAY TELL VICKY KENNEDY

2437
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
THAT SHE OR SOMEONE ELSE, BUT

2438
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
PROBABLY VICKY KENNEDY, THAT SHE

2439
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
COULD RUN IN THE PRIMARY TO FILL

2440
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
THE REMAINING TWO YEARS OF

2441
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
KERRY'S TERM AND IF THE

2442
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE A BLOOD

2443
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,000
BATH, IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH MORE

2444
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
DIFFICULT FOR SCOTT BROWN TO WIN

2445
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,000
IN A GENERAL ELECTION, A SPECIAL

2446
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,000
ELECTION.

2447
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
>> Brian: WOW.

2448
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
HE SEEMS TO HAVE DONE SUCH A

2449
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
GOOD JOB.

2450
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,000
THANKS SO MUCH.

2451
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
APPRECIATE THE INSIDE BALL ON

2452
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000

>> THANK YOU, BRIAN.

2454
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
ALWAYS A PLEASURE.

2455
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
>> Brian: COMING UP STRAIGHT

2456
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000

2457
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
NEWTOWN SHOOTING, WE'RE TALKING

2458
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
ABOUT SCHOOL SECURITY.

2459
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GUN CONTROL.

2460
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
WE ALSO NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE

2461
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
CULTURE IN THIS COUNTRY.

2462
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
ARE WE HEADING IN THE WRONG

2463
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
DIRECTION?
DO WE NEED TO GO BACK TO PRAYER?

2464
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
GOVERNOR HUCKABEE THINKS SO.

2465
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,000
WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT NEXT

2466
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:44,000
[ Male Announcer ]
IN BLIND TASTE TESTS,
EVEN RAGU USERS CHOSE PREGO.

2467
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
PREGO?!
BUT I'VE BOUGHT RAGU FOR YEARS.

2468
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
[ Thinking ] WONDER WHAT OTHER
QUESTIONABLE CHOICES I'VE MADE?

2469
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
I CHOOSE DATE NUMBER 2!

2470
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,000
WHOOO!

2471
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
[ sigh of relief ]

2472
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,000
[ Male Announcer ]
CHOOSE TASTE. CHOOSE PREGO.

2473
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
FIVE DAYS LATER,
I HAD A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK.

2474
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,000
BAYER ASPIRIN WAS THE FIRST
THING THE EMTS GAVE ME.

2475
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,000
NOW, I'M ON
A BAYER ASPIRIN REGIMEN.

2476
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,000
[ Male Announcer ] BE SURE
TO TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

2477
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
BEFORE YOU BEGIN
AN ASPIRIN REGIMEN.

2478
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:17,000
[ Woman ]
LEARN FROM MY STORY.

2479
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000

SO WE'RE GOING TO BRING YOU MORE

2481
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
HARROWING STORIES NOW, GOOD NEWS

2482
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
THAT HAS COME OUT OF THE

2483
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
HORRIBLE NEWS IN NEWTOWN,

2484
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
CONNECTICUT.

2485
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
THE SCHOOL NURSE WHO WAS ABLE TO

2486
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
SURVIVE.
WHY?

2487
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
BECAUSE SHE HAD THE WHEREWITHAL

2488
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
GOING UNDERNEATH HER DESK AND

2489
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
EVENTUALLY INTO A CLOSET WITH

2490
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
ANOTHER ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES

2491
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
FROM THE SCHOOL.

2492
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:16,000
SHE WAS INTERVIEWED LAST NIGHT

2493
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
JUST ABOUT HOW LONG SHE WAS IN

2494
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
THIS CLOSET AND WHETHER OR NOT

2495
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
SHE BELIEVED THAT IT WAS

2496
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
ACTUALLY THE REAL POLICE WHO

2497
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:28,000
WERE THERE TO FINALLY SAVE HER.

2498
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
>> YOU KNOW, IT WAS THIS

2499
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,000
HORRIBLE FEELING, YOU KNOW.

2500
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:35,000
JUST LIKE A NIGHTMARE THAT --

2501
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT, YOU

2502
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,000
KNOW -- IT'S AD ABOUT DREAM.

2503
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
AFTER SOME TIME, I THINK IT WAS

2504
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
ABOUT 11:15.
SO WE HAD BEEN IN THAT CLOSET

2505
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF.

2506
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
I OPENED THE DOOR AND I PEEKED

2507
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
OUT 'CAUSE MY OFFICE HAS A LOT

2508
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
OF WINDOWS.

2509
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
AND LOOKED INTO THE COURTYARD

2510
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
AND I JUST SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE

2511
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
MAYBE SWAT PEOPLE, BUT I DIDN'T

2512
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,000
KNOW WHO THEY WERE.

2513
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
I DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WERE

2514
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,000
OTHER SHOOTERS.

2515
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
IT WASN'T UNTIL ABOUT 1:15 WHEN

2516
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,000
SOMEBODY WAS JIGGLING THE DOOR

2517
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
AND, BUT NOBODY CALLED OUT.

2518
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
SO I DECIDED TO BE BRAVE ENOUGH

2519
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
AND OPEN THAT DOOR INTO THE

2520
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
OFFICE AND A LOT OF STATE POLICE

2521
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
OFFICERS WERE THERE AT THAT

2522
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
POINT.
THEY WERE VERY SURPRISED TO SEE

2523
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
ME.
>> Steve: SHE WAS IN THERE FOR

2524
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,000
FOUR HOURS.

2525
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,000
SHE SAYS THAT FRIDAY STARTED

2526
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,000
JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER DAY THERE

2527
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
AT SANDY HOOK.

2528
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,000
9:15, PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE.

2529
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
9:20, DOORS LOCKED.

2530
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
9:30, WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

2531
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
THEY HAD BEEN PREPARING FOR

2532
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
EMERGENCIES LIKE THAT EVERY

2533
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
MONTH.
HERE ONCE AGAIN, SALLY COX, A

2534
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
SCHOOL NURSE.

2535
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:45,000
>> WE HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF

2536
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
DRILLS.
IN ADDITION TO FIRE DRILLS AND

2537
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
HIGH WIND DRILLS AND LOCKDOWN

2538
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,000
DRILLS AND EVACUATION DRILLS.

2539
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,000
SO WE'VE DONE IT.

2540
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,000
WE'VE BEEN DOING IT EACH MONTH

2541
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

2542
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
>> SO YOU HAD DONE THOSE KIND OF

2543
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
THINGS FAIRLY RECENTLY?

2544
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
>> YEP.
>> Brian: ONE STORY THAT IS

2545
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,000
ABSOLUTELY STUNNING TO ME IS

2546
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
VICTORIA SOTO, THE 27-YEAR-OLD

2547
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
SINGLE TEACH WHO ARE PUT HER

2548
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
KIDS IN THE CLOSET, TOLD THE

2549
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,000
GUNMAN THEY'RE ALL DOWN AT THE

2550
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
AUDITORIUM AND SIX KIDS PANICKED

2551
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
AND RAN OUT.

2552
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
SHE DOVE IN FRONT OF THEM.

2553
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,000
THEY GOT KILLED.

2554
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,000
THE REST IN THE CLOSET, THE

2555
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
TRAUMA THEY MUST BE SEVERANCING

2556
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
NOW IS BEYOND BELIEF.

2557
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:26,000
IF A NAVY SEAL DID THIS, I'D BE

2558
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,000
IN AWE.

2559
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,000
BUT FOR A TEACH BETTER NO

2560
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
EXPERIENCE TO HAVE THOSE

2561
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
INSTINCTS IS ABSOLUTELY

2562
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,000
INCREDIBLE.

2563
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PERHAPS

2564
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
SAVED A NUMBER OF LIVES IS

2565
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
DURING THE COMMOTION, SOMEBODY

2566
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
IN THE OFFICE KEYED THE PUBLIC

2567
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
ADDRESS SYSTEM AND PEOPLE COULD

2568
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
HEAR THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING,

2569
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
THEN COULD HEAR A SCREAM AND

2570
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
COULD HEAR GUN SHOTS.

2571
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,000
IT WAS ONLY ON FOR A COUPLE OF

2572
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,000
SECONDS, BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH AND

2573
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
THE TEACHERS STARTED LOCKING THE

2574
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
DOORS FROM THE INSIDE.

2575
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
HOW MANY CHILDREN'S LIVES WERE

2576
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
SAVED BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAD THE

2577
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,000
QUICK THINKING TO DO JUST THAT?

2578
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
>> Gretchen: THIS WILL PROBABLY

2579
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,000
CHANGE THE WAY IN WHICH SO MANY

2580
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,000
SCHOOLS VIEW SECURITY AND WHAT'S

2581
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
NEXT?
WHERE HAVE WE COME TO IN A

2582
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
CULTURE WHERE WE HAVE TO RETHINK

2583
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
ALL OF THIS ABOUT OUR KIDS BEING

2584
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
SAFE AT SCHOOL?

2585
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
>> Brian: COMING UP STRAIGHT
AHEAD, SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST

2586
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
DETAILED REPORT YET ABOUT WHAT

2587
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
HAPPENED IN BENGHAZI.

2588
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
IT'S DUE OUT WITHIN HOURS.

2589
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
WILL IT PROVIDE ANY ANSWERS?

2590
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
THAT'S THE KEY.

2591
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:23,000
>> Steve: AND HE SEARCHED FOR

2592
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,000
HIS LOST DOG FOR FIVE YEARS.

2593
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,000
AND THE MOMENT HE'S REUNITED IS

2594
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
CAUGHT ON CAMERA.

2595
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
WE'RE GOING TO SHOW IT TO YOU

2596
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,000
anh
and creamy...

2597
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
is it really 100 calories?

2598
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Let me put you on webcan...

2599
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
...lean roasted chicken...

2600
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
and a creamy broth

2601
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Mmm
I can still see you.

2602
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:45,000
[ Male announcer ] Progresso.
You gotta taste this soup.

2603
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
A BODY AT REST
TENDS TO STAY AT REST...

2604
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,000
WHILE A BODY IN MOTION
TENDS TO STAY IN MOTION.

2605
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,000
STAYING ACTIVE CAN ACTUALLY
EASE ARTHRITIS SYMPTO.

2606
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
BUT IF YOU HAVE ARTHRITIS,

2607
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
STAYING ACTIVE
CAN BE DIFFICULT.

2608
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
PRESCRIPTION CELEBREX
CAN HELP RELIEVE ARTHRITIS PAIN

2609
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
SO YOUR BODY
CAN STAY IN MOTION.

2610
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
BECAUSE JUST ONE
200MG CELEBREX A DAY

2611
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
CAN PROVIDE 24 HOUR RELIEF

2612
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
FOR MANY WITH ARTHRITIS PAIN
AND INFLAMMATION.

2613
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
PLUS, IN CLINICAL STUDIES,

2614
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
CELEBREX IS PROVEN TO IMPROVE
DAILY PHYSICAL FUNCTION

2615
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
SO MOVING IS EASIER.

2616
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
CELEBREX CAN BE TAKEN WITH

2617
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
AND IT'S NOT A NARCOTIC.

2618
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR
SHOULD BALANCE THE BENETS

2619
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000

CARDIOVASCULAR WARNING.

2625

02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:20,000
MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
PETER WHAT, DO YOU KNOW?

2710
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
>> BRIAN, I KNOW THAT I SPOKE TO

2711
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
A REGULAR AT ONE OF THE

2712
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
RESTAURANTS THAT NANCY LANZA

2713
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
LIKED TO GO TO, CALLED MY PLACE,

2714
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

2715
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
AND THIS MAN, RICH COLLINS, TOLD

2716
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,000
ME THAT SINCE HE HAS A SON, A

2717
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
TEENAGE SON WITH AUTISM AND

2718
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
NANCY'S SON, ADAM, HAD

2719
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
ASBURGERS, THE TWO OF THEM WOULD

2720
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
BOND OVER THE DIFFICULTIES OF

2721
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,000
RAISING THEIR CHILDREN AND WHAT

2722
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:49,000
HE JUST TOLD ME IS VERY

2723
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
REVEALING.
>> NANCY WOULD GET UPSET BECAUSE

2724
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,000
HER SON REFUSED TO LET HER TOUCH

2725
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
HIM.
SHE COULDN'T HUG HIM.

2726
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
WHERE MY SON IS JUST THE

2727
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,000
OPPOSITE.
SHE'D SEE MY SON HANGING ALL

2728
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:05,000
OVER ME, BUT AUTISTIC KIDS, EACH

2729
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IS

2730
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,000
DIFFERENT.

2731
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,000
>> YOU SAID THAT THERE WERE
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT SHE TRIED

2732
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
TO DO BECAUSE SHE HAD A HARD

2733
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
TIME BONDING WITH HIM.

2734
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
>> YES.
SHE WAS TRYING TO BOND, FIND

2735
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
WAYS TO BOND WITH HIM.

2736
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
SHE TOLD ME THE GUNS, SHE WOULD

2737
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
TAKE THEM SHOOTING BECAUSE THAT

2738
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:26,000
WAS A WAY THAT A SINGLE MOM

2739
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
COULD RELATE TO HER SON AND SO

2740
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:33,000
SHE WOULD TAKE HIM OUT SHOOTING.

2741
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
>> RICH ALSO TOLD ME HE DOESN'T

2742
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
THINK NANCY, AS A SINGLE MOM H

2743
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,000
THE KIND OF SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT

2744
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:42,000
SHE NEEDED TO DEAL WITH HER SON,

2745
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,000
ADAM.

2746
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,000
NOW, LAST NIGHT IT IS WORTH

2747
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,000
POINTING OUT, PRESIDENT OBAMA

2748
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:48,000
DID SPECIFICALLY MENTION MENTAL

2749
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHILE HE

2750
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
WAS PROMISING TO STOP SENSELESS

2751
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
SHOOTING SPREES IN THE FUTURE.

2752
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
>> IN THE COMING WEEKS, I'LL USE

2753
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE HOLDS

2754
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,000
TO ENGAGE MY FELLOW CITIZENS

2755
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,000
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, MENTAL

2756
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, TO PARENTS

2757
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,000
AND EDUCATORS IN AN EFFORT AIMED

2758
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,000
AT PREVENTING MORE TRAGEDIES

2759
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
LIKE THIS.

2760
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,000
>> EVEN THOUGH THE WEATHER HERE

2761
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
FOR THE LAST 24 HOURS OR SO HAS

2762
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
BEEN COLD AND WET, THERE HAVE

2763
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
BEEN LOTS OF PEOPLE OUT PAYING

2764
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
THEIR RESPECTS TO THE FALLEN AT

2765
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
MAKESHIFT MEMORIALS AND AT

2766
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
VIGILS.
WE DO EXPECT TO GET MORE

2767
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,000
INFORMATION SOMETIME TODAY FROM

2768
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
THE POLICE ABOUT THE LATEST IN

2769
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,000
THEIR INVESTIGATION.

2770
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,000
BACK TO YOU.

2771
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,000
>> Steve: ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

2772
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,000
>> Gretchen: AND AN EMOTIONALLY

2773
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
TRYING DAY AHEAD IN NEWTOWN,

2774
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
CONNECTICUT.
THE FIRST OF THE FUNERALS ARE

2775
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
BEING HELD.

2776
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:42,000
ONE FOR THE YOUNGEST VICTIMS,

2777
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,000
NOAH POSNER TURNED SIX LAST

2778
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
MONTH.
THE OTHER FOR SIX-YEAR-OLD JACK

2779
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,000
PINTO.
BECAUSE HE'S SUCH A HUGE GIANTS

2780
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
FAN, HIS PARENTS MAY BURY HIM IN

2781
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,000
HIS FAVORITE JERSEY.

2782
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,000
THAT BRINGS US TO THE STORY OF

2783
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,000
ONE LITTLE GIRL OUT OF THE

2784
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
ENTIRE CLASS WHO HAPPENED TO

2785
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
SURVIVE.

2786
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,000
15 KIDS IN THE CLASS, THEY WERE

2787
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
ALL SHOT DEAD.

2788
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
BUT SHE DECIDED TO PLAY DEAD.

2789
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, HOW

2790
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:11,000
DOES A SIX-YEAR-OLD KNOW HOW TO

2791
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
DO THAT?

2792
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
SHE HAD THE MENTAL CAPACITY -- I

2793
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
DON'T KNOW.

2794
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,000
HOPEFULLY THERE WAS SOME INNER

2795
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
STRENGTH IN HER THAT I'D LIKE TO

2796
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
BELIEVE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT

2797
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
IT WAS, BUT SHE SURVIVED.

2798
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
>> Brian: I WONDER IF THAT

2799
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,000
MATCHES UP WITH THE STORY WE

2800
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
HEARD INITIALLY OF A CHILD

2801
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
WALKING OUT WITH BLOOD ON THEM,

2802
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
BUT WAS OKAY.

2803
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN BECAUSE SHE

2804
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
WALKED OUT WITH BLOOD ON HER OF

2805
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
THAT OF HER FRIENDS SAYING I'M

2806
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,000
OKAY.
ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD (QUITE A

2807
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,000
STORY.

2808
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,000
MEANWHILE, JOINING US NOW IS THE

2809
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,000
HOST OF "HUCKABEE," A FELLOW

2810
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
NAMED GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE.

2811
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
HE JOINSES FROM HIS HOME DOWN IN

2812
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
FLORIDA.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

2813
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,000
>> GOOD MORNING, STEVE, BRIAN,

2814
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
GRETCHEN.
>> Steve: GREAT TO HAVE YOU.

2815
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
ON FRIDAY MORNING AT SANDY HOOK

2816
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, SCHOOL PRAYER

2817
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:01,000
RETURNED TO THAT PUBLIBECAUSE OE

2818
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,000
HEARING THIS MORNING, AS WE

2819
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,000
HEARD OVER THE WEEKEND, WAS SO

2820
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
MANY OF THE TEACHERS HUDDLED

2821
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
THEIR CHILDREN IN CORNERS AND

2822
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:11,000
CLOSETS AND THEY PRAYED

2823
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:14,000
TOGETHER.
>> I THINK IT'S A COMMON HUMAN

2824
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
REACTION WHEN ALL OF OUR HUMAN

2825
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
ANSWERS HAVE FAILED, THAT'S WHEN

2826
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
WE MAYBE FINALLY RECOGNIZE THAT

2827
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
WE REALLY NEED GOD.

2828
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:25,000
AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING BY ANY

2829
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,000
STRETCH THAT IF WE HAD PRAYER IN

2830
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
SCHOOLS REGULARLY AS WE ONCE DID

2831
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,000
THAT THIS WOULDN'T HAVE

2832
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,000
HAPPENED, 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE

2833
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
THAT KIND OF DIRECT CAUSE AND

2834
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
EFFECT.
BUT WE'VE CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE

2835
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,000
IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE THE ONLY

2836
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,000
TIME WE WANT TO INVOKE GOD'S

2837
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,000
NAME IS AFTER THE TRAGEDY AND

2838
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
I'M GRATEFUL, THE PRESIDENT

2839
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
QUOTED SCRIPTURE.

2840
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,000
HE TALKED VERSUS FROM THE NEW

2841
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,000
TESTAMENT AND THAT'S GOOD.

2842
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
WE NEED THAT COMFORT.
BUT WE NEED TO CREATE AN

2843
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
ATMOSPHERE IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE

2844
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:55,000
MORALITY IS NOT SOMETHING WE

2845
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
DISCUSS ONLY WHEN WE HAVE NO

2846
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
OTHER PLACE TO RUN, WHICH I'M

2847
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:00,000
AFRAID SOMETIMES IS THE WAY IT

2848
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
GOES.

2849
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
WE CRITICIZE ANYBODY WHO INVOKES

2850
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,000
GOD'S NAME, EXCEPT AFTER A

2851
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
TRAGEDY LIKE THIS AND THEN IT

2852
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
SEEMS TO BE OKAY.

2853
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,000
>> Gretchen: EXACTLY.

2854
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,000
WHEN I PUT MY CHILDREN TO BED AT

2855
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
NIGHT, I SAY GOD IS ALWAYS WITH

2856
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
YOU, WHEN YOU WAKE UP AND YOU'RE

2857
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:17,000
LONELY, KNOW HE'S WITH YOU.

2858
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,000
YESTERDAY AT OUR CHURCH,

2859
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
GOVERNOR, IT WAS JUST SO MOVING.

2860
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
THEY LIT A CANDLE FOR EVERY ONE

2861
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,000
OF THE VICTIMS AND THEY HONORED

2862
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:28,000
THEM AND IT WAS SO WONDERFUL TO

2863
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
KNOW THAT IF YOU WERE A PERSON

2864
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,000
OF FAITH, THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF

2865
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
QUESTIONS WHY, BUT YOU HAVE

2866
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,000
SOMETHING TO HOLD ON TO.

2867
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
>> I HEARD IT ONCE SAID,

2868
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
GRETCHEN, AND I THINK IT'S AN

2869
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,000
APPLICABLE STATEMENT THAT EVEN

2870
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,000
IF YOU'RE A BELIEVER, YOU STILL

2871
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
HIT BOTTOM, BUT AT LEAST YOU

2872
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,000
FIND OUT IT IS SOLID AT THE

2873
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,000
BOTTOM.
AND SO IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE

2874
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:52,000
SPARED FROM GRIEF OR PAIN OR

2875
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
SUFFERING, 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT.

2876
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,000
BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A

2877
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,000
WORLD THAT GOES BEYOND THE EVIL

2878
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
AND THE HORRORS OF THIS ONE AND

2879
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
GIVES US SOME PERSPECTIVE TO

2880
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:02,000
LIVE FOR.

2881
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT HOPE, IF

2882
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
THERE WAS NOT -- AGAIN, I REFER

2883
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID LAST

2884
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
NIGHT.

2885
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
HE SPOKE OF HEAVEN.

2886
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
THOSE ARE WORDS OF HOPE.

2887
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
IF WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE

2888
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:16,000
IS SUCH A PLACE, THAT THERE IS

2889
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
SOMETHING BEYOND THIS PHYSICAL

2890
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:20,000
LIFE WE LIVE, THEN THERE IS NO

2891
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,000
HOPE.
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

2892
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
WE QUIT APOLOGIZING FOR HAVING A

2893
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
SPIRITUAL CONVERSATION, THAT WE

2894
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,000
SOMEHOW QUIT BEING ASHAMED THAT

2895
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
WE BELIEVE IN GOD AND WE

2896
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
RECOGNIZE, IT'S THE ONLY THING

2897
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
THAT KEEPS US TOGETHER WHEN

2898
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
THERE IS AN INEXPLICABLE TRAGEDY

2899
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,000
LIKE THE ONE WE'VE SEEN WITH SO

2900
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
MUCHOR AND PAIN.

2901
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
>> Brian: GOVERNOR, AS I

2902
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:44,000
MENTIONED WHEN YOU WERE ON THE
COUCH ON SATURDAY, IS THAT THE

2903
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
TOWN GOT IT TOGETHER.

2904
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
THEY SEEM LIKE A VERY SPIRITUAL

2905
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
PLACE, THE IDEAL TOWN.
YOU SKETCHED THIS OUT IN A

2906
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
CHILDREN'S BOOK AND SAY THIS IS

2907
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
WHERE YOU WANT TO GROW UP.

2908
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
THEIR REACTION IN THE TIMES IN

2909
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
WHICH THE SHOOTING WAS TAKEN

2910
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,000
PLACE, HEROIC.

2911
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,000
THEIR ACTIONS AFTERWARDS,

2912
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,000
TREMENDOUS EMPATHY AND SYMPATHY

2913
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,000
FROM AROUND THE WORLD.

2914
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:07,000
THE GOD THAT NEEDED GOD WAS THE

2915
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
SHOOTER.

2916
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
AND THE ASSAILANT IS THE

2917
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:13,000
PROBLEM.
NOT THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN.

2918
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,000
>> WHEN WE CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE,

2919
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,000
WHEN WE TELL PEOPLE GOD REALLY

2920
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:18,000
ISN'T A PART OF OUR CREATION,

2921
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,000
THAT WE'RE JUST BIOLOGICAL

2922
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,000
ACCIDENTS AND THEN WE RAISE A

2923
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:23,000
WHOLE GENERATION TO BELIEVE THAT

2924
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
HE'S IRRELEVANT, THAT IT'S FOR

2925
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE

2926
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,000
INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY TO THINK

2927
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
BIGGER THAN THAT, THAT IT'S FOR

2928
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
SIMPLETONS TO BELIEVE IN GOD,

2929
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT?

2930
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
THIS IS THE NET RESULT.

2931
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
WE REAP WHAT WE SOW WHEN WE ONLY

2932
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
INVOKE GOD AFTER THE CRISIS, BUT

2933
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
WE DON'T CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE

2934
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,000
IN WHICH WE SAY, WE ARE

2935
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
ACCOUNTABLE, THAT WE ARE SPECIAL

2936
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
BECAUSE WE'RE CREATED WITH A

2937
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
PURPOSE.

2938
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
GIVE A PERSON A PURPOSE, A SENSE

2939
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:53,000
OF REASON FOR EXISTENCE THAT HE

2940
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
OR SHE IS THE CREATION OF AN

2941
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,000
ALMIGHTY, ALL KNOWING GOD AND

2942
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
YOU GIVE THAT PERSON A BASIS FOR

2943
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
LIVING THAT A PERSON DOES NOT

2944
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,000
HAVE IF YOU HONESTLY THINK THAT

2945
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:08,000
YOU'RE NOTHING MORE THAN A BLOB

2946
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:13,000
OF PROCEED PROTO PLATFORM WITH

2947
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,000
NOTHING BEYOND THIS LIFE.

2948
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
>> Steve: OUR GUN LAWS AND
THINGS LIKE THAT, THERE WILL BE

2949
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
A BROADER DISCUSSION LOOKING AT

2950
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
HOW WE HAVE GLORIFIED VIOLENCE

2951
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
IN OUR CULTURE, WHETHER IT'S THE

2952
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,000
MOVIES OR THE VIDEO GAMES OR

2953
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
JUST THE COARSENING OF THE

2954
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
CULTURE ITSELF.

2955
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,000
>> STEVE, THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

2956
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
DISCUSSION FOR US TO HAVE.

2957
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
WHEN WE SEPARATE VIOLENCE FROM

2958
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,000
SOME PURPOSE, PEOPLE WILL SAY,

2959
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
BUT THE BIBLE HAS VIOLENCE.

2960
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,000
IT DOES.

2961
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
BUT THAT VIOLENCE WAS ALWAYS

2962
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
COUCHED IN THE TERMS OF MORAL

2963
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,000
GOODNESS OR MORAL EVIL.

2964
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
IT WAS NEVER NEUTRAL.

2965
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
AND THAT'S WHERE WE END UP WITH

2966
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
WHEN VIOLENCE BECOMES A PART OF

2967
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
SOME NEUTRAL EXPRESSION AND

2968
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH SOME OF

2969
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
THE GAMES.
NOT THAT EVERY KID WHO PLAYS A

2970
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
VIDEO GAME IS A POTENTIAL MASS

2971
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,000
MURDERER 'CAUSE THAT'S NONSENSE.

2972
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:03,000
BUT A CHILD WHO ALREADY HAS A

2973
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,000
PROPENSITY TOWARDS PSYCHOLOGICAL

2974
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
DISCONNECTS AND THEN YOU LOCK

2975
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
THAT KID IN HIS ROOM WITH A

2976
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
COMPUTER SCREEN AND A SMART

2977
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
PHONE, WITH VIDEO GAMES AND HE

2978
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
DOESN'T HAVE HUMAN CONNECTION,

2979
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
HIS ONLY CONNECTION TO THE WORLD

2980
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
IS ELECTRONIC AND A LOT OF THAT

2981
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,000
IS MOLDED BY THESE INCREDIBLY

2982
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:23,000
VIOLENT IMAGES, AND I THINK WE

2983
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
END UP SEEING THAT YOU CAN NOT

2984
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
OPERATE A CIVIL SOCIETY IN A

2985
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,000
MORAL VACUUM.

2986
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
THERE HAS TO BE SOME SENSE IN

2987
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
WHICH MORALITY EXISTS AND THEN

2988
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,000
THE QUESTION COMES, WHERE DOES

2989
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
MORALITY COME FROM?

2990
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
IT DOESN'T JUST ESTABLISH

2991
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,000
ITSELF.
IF THERE IS NOT AN OBJECTIVE

2992
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
STANDARD IN OUR CASE, I THINK

2993
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
WE'D SAY THERE IS A GOD WHO

2994
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
GIVES US THE STANDARD, THEN

2995
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,000
EVERYBODY GETS TO MAKE UP HIS

2996
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
OWN RULES AND THAT'S WHEN A

2997
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,000
CULTURE AND A CIVILIZATION

2998
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
COMPLETELY FALLS APART.

2999
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,000
>> Steve: GREAT CONVERSATION.

3000
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,000
GOVERNOR HUCKABEE, THANK YOU

3001
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,000

THANK YOU.

3006
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,000

OUT OF HIS HOME.

3018
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
HE OPENED FIRED ON THE OFFICERS

3019

AS THEY WERE RESPONDING TO A

3020
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:29,000
CALL.
HIS CONDITION IS NOT CLEAR AT

DIDN'T ACTUALLY WANT TO GO?

3576
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,000
COULD THAT POSSIBLY HAVE

02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:08,000
WHO KNEW OR TRIED TO GET TO KNOW

3602
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:11,000
ADAM LANZA, HERE IS ONE OF HIS

3603
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:12,000
CLASSMATES.

3604
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:13,000
>> HE JUST WOULD GET VERY

3605
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
NERVOUS AND HIS FACE WOULD TURN

3606
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:18,000
BRIGHT RED AND HE WOULD GET VERY

3607
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:19,000
FIDGETY.
YOU COULD JUST TELL THAT IT

3608
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:20,000
WASN'T THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW THE

3609
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:21,000
ANSWER.

3610
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:22,000
IT'S JUST THAT IT WAS VERY

3611
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:25,000
DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO SAY WHAT HE

3612
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
WANTED TO SAY.

3613
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
HE MUST HAVE REALLY FELT

3614
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:30,000
UNCOMFORTABLE IN ANY KIND OF

3615
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:31,000
SOCIAL SITUATION BECAUSE HE

3616
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:34,000
NEVER REALLY PUT HIMSELF OUT

3617
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
THERE AND I JUST DON'T REALLY

3618
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
REMEMBER HIM EVER STEPPING

3619
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:42,000
FORWARD OR REALLY SAYING

3620
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
ANYTHING.
HE WANTED TO BE LEFT ALONE AND

3621
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:47,000
WE LEFT HIM ALONE.

3622
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:48,000
>> Brian: I SAW ONE OF THESE

3623
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:51,000
ARTICLES THAT QUOTED THE NOTED

3624
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:54,000
CHILD PSYCHIATRIST, AND HE SAYS

3625
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
HAVING ASBURGERS,  WHICH HE IS

3626
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
RUMORED TO HAVE IT, BY ITSELF

3627
02:36:58,000 --> 02:36:59,000
DOES NOT MAKE YOU LIKE THREE

3628
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:00,000
KILL.

3629
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:01,000
BUT HAVING IT, BEING SOCIALLY

3630
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:02,000
AWKWARD, FEELING TRAPPED,

3631
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
FEELING EDUCATIONALLY

3632
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:05,000
OVERWHELMED, FEELING DESPAIR

3633
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:06,000
WITHOUT ANY TOOLS TO GET YOU OUT

3634
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:10,000
OF THAT BOX CAN LEAD A HUMAN

3635
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
BEING TO DO DESPERATE THINGS.

3636
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:13,000
>> Steve: AFTER EVENTS LIKE

3637
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:14,000
THIS, PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GOING,

3638
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
HOW DID HE SLIP THROUGH THE

3639
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:17,000
CRACKS?
APPARENTLY HE DIDN'T.

3640
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:18,000
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IDENTIFIED HIM

3641
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
WHEN HE WAS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL

3642
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:21,000
THAT THIS WAS SOMEBODY THEY

3643
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:25,000
SHOULD WATCH.
WHEN HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, HE

3644
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
HAD A PERMANENT PSYCHOLOGIST,

3645
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:28,000
SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST ASSIGNED TO

3646
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:29,000
HIM.
IT WASN'T THAT THEY WERE WORRIED

3647
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:30,000
HE WAS GOING TO BE VIOLENT.

3648
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:33,000
BUT GIVEN HIS AWKWARD SOCIAL

3649
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:34,000
GRACES, THEY WERE WORRIED THAT

3650
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
HE WOULD BE A VICTIM TO SOMEBODY

3651
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:39,000
ELSE OR PERHAPS EVEN HURT

3652
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:40,000
HIMSELF.

3653
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:41,000
MEANWHILE, 25 MINUTES BEFORE THE
TOP OF THE HOUR.

3654
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
OTHER HEADLINES ON THIS MONDAY,

3655
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
ONE DAY AFTER THE NEWTOWN

3656
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
SHOOTING, A MAN UNDER ARREST FOR

3657
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:51,000
SHOOTING A SCHOOL MASSACRE IN

3658
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:52,000
END IN.

3659
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:53,000
POLICE FOUND 47 GUNS IN HIS

3660
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
HOME, RIGHT NEXT O AN ELEMENTARY

3661
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
SCHOOL WHERE HIS WIFE WORKS.

3662
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
DURING A FIGHT, MYER ALLEGEDLY

3663
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:02,000
THREATENED TO SET FIRE TO HIS

3664
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:03,000
WIFE, THEN SAID HE WOULD GO TO

3665
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
THE SCHOOL AND KILL AS MANY

3666
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:08,000
PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.

3667
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:09,000
>> Gretchen: PRESIDENT OBAMA'S

3668
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
$60 BILLION REQUEST FOR AID FOR

3669
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:12,000
SANDY VICTIMS HAS TURNED INTO A

3670
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
CHRISTMAS STOCK OF GOODIES FOR

3671
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
FEDERAL AGENCIES AND EVEN NOW

3672
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:19,000
THE STATE OF ALASKA.

3673
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:23,000
IF YOU'RE SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD
TO FIGURE THAT OUT, HERE IT IS.

3674
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
NEW YORK POST LEARNING IT

3675
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:26,000
INCLUDED $150 MILLION TORE

3676
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:30,000

3677
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:31,000
ALSO $41 MILLION FOR MILITARY

KENNEDY SPACE CENTER WHERE WORE

3680
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:36,000
$40 MILLION FOR REPAIRS AND THE

3681
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:37,000
SMITHSONIAN WOULD GET 2 MILLION.

3682
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
REPUBLICANS SAY A VOTE ON THE

3683
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:40,000
BILL WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL AFTER

3684
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
CHRISTMAS BECAUSE OF A LACK OF

3685
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
DETAILS ABOUT THE MEASURE.

3686
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:45,000
BRIAN?

3687
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:46,000
>> Brian: AFTER A TOUGH FEW

3688
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:47,000
WEEKS, KATE MIDDLETON IS BACK IN

3689
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:48,000
THE SPOTLIGHT.

3690
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:51,000
HERE IS THE PREGNANT DUCHESS

3691
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:52,000

AWARDS.

3694
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
THIS IS IN LONDON WHERE SHE WENT

3695
02:38:58,000 --> 02:38:59,000
TO DO AWARDS.

3696
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:00,000
EARLIER THIS MONTH SHE WAS

3697
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
HOSPITALIZED FOR SEVERE MORNING

3698
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:03,000
SICKNESS.

3699
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:04,000
SHE WASN'T FEELING WELL ENOUGH

3700
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
TO STAY FOR THE ENTIRE FOUR HOUR

3701
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
EHAVE NOT AND WENT HOME AFTER 45

3702
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:09,000
MINUTES.

3703
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:10,000
>> Gretchen: A MAN WHOSE DOG WAS

STOLEN HAS BEEN REUNITED REUNITH

GUESS HOW MANY YEARS.

3707
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:19,000
FIVE YEARS LATER.

3708
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:24,000
>> THAT'S SO COOL.

3709
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
>> HE'S BEEN EVERYWHERE.

3710
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
>> Gretchen: ANOTHER STORY TO

3711
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:30,000
CRY ABOUT.

3712
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
EMOTIONAL REUNION, A LONG TIME

3713
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
COMING, THE MAN SAYS BANDIT HAD

3714
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
RUN OUT OF HIS HOME AND A MAN

3715
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
PICKED HIM UP AND DROVE OFF.

3716
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:39,000
BUT HE WAS FOUND LAST MONTH AND

3717
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:42,000
WAS SET TO BE EUTHANIZED AT A

3718
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:43,000
SHELTER, SO HE WAS SENT TO

3719
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:44,000
ANOTHER AND THAT'S WHERE THEY

3720
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD A

3721
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:47,000
MICROCHIP.

3722
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
AND THEY CONNECTED HIM BACK WITH

3723
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:50,000
HIS HAPPY OWNER.

3724
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:51,000
>> Steve: ANOTHER GOOD REASON TO

02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:54,000
CHIP YOUR DOGS AND YOUR CATS.

3729
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
THERE IS A WHOLE BUNCH OF RAIN,

RIGHT NOW MOVING THROUGH THE

02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:15,000

NEW ENGLAND.
AS YOU CAN SEE, BEHIND THE FRONT

3748
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
IT'S MUCH CHILLIER.

3749
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
RIGHT NOW WE'VE ONLY GOT

3750
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:30,000

NORTHERN PLAINS, STILL PORTIONS

3765
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:57,000

3766
02:40:57,000 --> 02:41:00,000
SHOULD BE 63 LATER TODAY IN LOS

3767
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000

UTAH, GOOD MORNING.

3769
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
YOUR DAYTIME HIGH WILL BE 44.

02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,000
EVEN DEMOCRATS WANT IT GONE.

3775
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
SO IS THE PRESIDENT STILL

3776
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
PUSHING FOR IT?
WE'LL EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS NEXT.

3777
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
>> Brian: THEN HE WORKED YEARS

3778
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:19,000
TO BUILD A SMALL BUSINESS AND IT

3779
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:20,000
WAS DESTROYED IN MINUTES BY

3780
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
ANGRY UNION PROTESTERS.
