DEFINITELY LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
>> SEAN: THIS IS A FOX NEWS

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
>> Sean: THIS IS A FOX NEWS
ALERT.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
SUSAN RICE,S. THE U.S. AMBASSADR

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
TO THE UNITED NATIONS WITHDREW

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
HER NAME FOR CONSIDERATION TO BE

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
THE L NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
IN A LETTER FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO,

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
SHEUN WROTE I AM CONFIDENT I COD

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
SERVE IN THE ROLE.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
HOWEVER, IF NOMINATED, I'M

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
CONVINCED THAT THE CONFIRMATION

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
PROCESS WOULD BE LENGTHY,

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
DISRUPTIVE, AND COSTLY TO YOU

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
AND TO OUR MOST PRESSING

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
PRIORITIES.
THE TRADEOFF IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
IT TO OUR COUNTRY.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
THIS COMES IN THE. WAKE OF

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS EXPRESSING

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
OPPOSITION TO HER NOMINATION

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
BECAUSE OF COMMENTS SHE MADE

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
AFTER FOUR AMERICANS WERE KILLED

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
IN A BLATANT TERRORIST ATTACK IN

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
BENGHAZI.
NOW AMBASSADOR RICE FIVE DAYS

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
LATER BLAMED ALL THE VIOLENCE ON

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
A YouTUBE VIDEO WHEN ALL THE

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
EVIDENCE SHOWED IT WAS NOT TRUE.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA RESPONDED TO THE

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
LETTER AND SAID THE ATTACKS ON

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
AMBASSADOR RICE HAVE BEEN UNFAIR

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
AND MISLEADING.

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
IN TYPICAL FASHION, THE MEDIA

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
JUMPED IN, NBC NEWS

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
SPECIFICALLY, TO RICE'S DEFENSE,

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
CONTINUED THEI
R FALSE NARRATIVE

54
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
THAT ANY CRITICISM OF HER IS NOT

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
ROOTED IN HER FALSE TESTIMONY

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
ABOUT RACISM.

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
ANOTHER DOG WHISTLE.

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
WATCH THIS.
>> I THINK THIS HAS BECOME AN

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGE FOR HER TO

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
BE CONFIRMED, THAT SHE REALIZED

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
THAT.
THE WHITE HOUSE REALIZED IT AS

62
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
WELL.

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I THINK THEY KNOW THEY ARE ON

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
GOOD POLITICAL SOLID GROUND AS

65
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
YOU WERE JUST POINTING OUT.

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE -- THIS

67
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
WON'T HELP REPUBLICANS AT ALL,

68
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
THE FACT THAT A WOMAN AND A

69
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
WOMAN OF COLOR HAS BEEN FORCED

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
OUT OF A CONFIRMATION PROCESS

71
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
EVEN BEFORE SHE WAS NOMINATED.

72
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
>> Sean: JOINING ME WITH

73
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
REACTION, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE

74
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
HOUSE NEWT GINGRICH.

75
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
HOW ARE YOU?

76
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
>> I'M DOING VERY, VERY WELL.

77
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I COULDN'T HELP BUT SMILE JUST

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
NOW AT THAT ABSURDITY.

79
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DID

80
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
NOMINATE COLIN PAWL WH COLIN POE

81
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
SECRETARY OF STATE.
THEY D NOMINATED CONDOLEEZA RICE

82
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
WHO BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE.

83
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
ON THOSE GROUNDS IT'S HARD TO

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
COME BACK AND SAY THAT THE

85
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
SENATORS WHO HT AD PROBLEMS WERE

86
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
DOING SO FOR EITHER RACIAL OR

87
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
SEXUAL REASONS.

88
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
THEY CLEARLY HAVE PROVEN IN THE

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
A WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH

90
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
AFRICAN-AMERICANS O, BOTH MALE D

91
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
FEMALE.

92
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I ACTUALLY THINK IT WOULD NOT BE

93
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
A BAD IDEA FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA

94
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER SEEING IF

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
PCOLIN POWELL WOULD COME OUT OF

96
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
RETIREMENT.
COLIN DID ENDORSET HIM.

97
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
THAT MIGHT BE A BI-PARTISAN STEP

98
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
THAT WOULD MOVE US IN A

99
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
DIRECTION OF A DIFFERENT KIND OF

100
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
DIALOGUE THAN WE'RE GOING TO GET

101
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
IF WE STAY WITH KIND OF LEFT

102
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
WING POLICIES.

103
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
>> Sean: THE EVIDENCE WAS

104
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
OVERWHELMING.

105
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
IT WAS INCONTROVERTIBLE IN THIS

106
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
PARTICULAR CASE.

107
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THE CAMPAIGN NEVER STOPS FOR THE

108
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
DEMOCRATS.
THERE'S NO TIME FOR ANY

109
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
GOVERNING HEREE  WHATSOEVER.

110
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
IT SEEMS THAT THEY WANT TO

111
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
HUMILIATE, CRUSH, DIVIDE AND

112
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
HURT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

113
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
AM I WRONG AS I OBSERVE THE

114
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
FISCAL CLIFF AND ALL OF THESE

115
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
ATTACKS THAT A EVER END, WAR ON

116
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
WOMEN NEVER ENDS?

117
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
>> YOU KNOW, I WAS A BIG FAN AND

118
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
VERY, VERY IMPRESSED WITH COACH

119
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
WOODEN'S USE OF THE FULL COURT

120
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
PRESS AT UCLA.

121
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE

122
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
BASKETBALL DYNASTIES IN HISTORY,

123
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY

124
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
AGAINST A FULL COURT PRESS, YOU

125
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
BETTER LEARN TO RUN A FULL COURT

126
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
PRESS.

127
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
IT IS AN OBJECTIVE FACT WE NOW

128
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
LIVE IN AN AGE WHERE A CHICAGO

129
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
STYLE MACHINE IS TRYING TO

130
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
ESTABLISH A PERMANENT 24-HOUR A

131
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
DAY, 365 DAYS A YEAR CAMPAIGN,

132
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
AND WE JUST BETTER LEARN HOW TO

133
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
COPE WITH IT AND HOW TO BE

134
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
INVOLVED WITH IT.
THE FACT IS IN THE CASE OF

135
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
AMBASSADOR RICE, SHE IS THE

136
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
PERSON WHO HAS A GRAVES WIT GRIH

137
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
THE PRESIDENT.
SHE WAS SENT OUT BY THE

138
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
PRESIDENT TO SAY THINGS THAT

139
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
WERE FAL
SE.
SHE WAS USED FOR FIVE SHOWS ON

140
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
ONE SUNDAY TO TELL THE AMERICAN

141
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
PEOPLE SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT

142
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
TRUE.

143
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I THINK IF SHE HAS COMPLAINT

144
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
WITH ANYBODY, IT OUGHT TO BE

145
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO SENT

146
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
HER OU ST THERE, USING HER

147
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
POLITICALLY EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS

148
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
THE UN AMBASSADOR.

149
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
>> Sean: YOU ALWAYS HAVE AN

150
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
INTERESTING TAKE ON THE EVENTS

151
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
OF THE DAY, SO WE HAVE ALL OF

152
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
THESE INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE THAT

153
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
HAVE OCCURRED, OCCUPY, WE SEE

154
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THE LEFT AT THESE G-20 SUMMITS.

155
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
NOW WE SAW STEPHEN CROWDER WHO

156
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
WORKS HERE PUNCHED IN THE FACE,

157
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
A TENT KNOCKED DOWN.

158
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON ALL

159
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
OF THIS BECAUSE THE SILENCE FROM

160
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
PRESIDENT CIVILITY IS DEAFENING

161
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
HERE.
THEY ARE HIS ALLIES AND HE HAS

162
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
SOME SWAY WITH THEM.

163
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
>> IN A NUMBER OF CASES,

164
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
PARTICULARLY WITH THREATS OF

165
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
VIOLENCE IN MICHIGAN, I HOPE THE

166
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN WOULD CALL

167
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
ON THE PRESIDENT TO ASK HIS

168
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
ALLIES TO BEHAVE IN A CIVIL AND

169
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
DECENT MANNER.

170
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
THERE'S NO JUSTIFICATION FOR

171
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
PEOPLE THREATENING VIOLENCE.

172
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I THINK ONE OF THE DEMOCRATIC

173
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
STATE SENATORS IN MICHIGAN SAID

174
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
THAT THEREAI WILL BE BLOOD.

175
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
WHAT KIND OF COMMENT IS THAT

176
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
FROM AN ELECTED OFFICIAL AND WHY

177
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
IS IT BEING TOLERATED?

178
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I ALWAYS THINK THE NETWORKS AND

179
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
THE NEW YORK SOMETIMES AND

180
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
OTHERS HAVE A REAL OBLIGATION TO

181
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
COVER UNION VIOLENCE WHEN IT

182
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
OCCURS AND NOT HIDE IT.

183
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I THINK YOU'RE RAISING A GOOD

184
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
POINT.
IT'S ONE THAT WE SHOULD BE

185
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
AGGRESSIVE IN DEMANDING THAT THE

186
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
PRESIDENT CALL ON HIS ALLIES TO

187
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
EXERCISE DISCIPLINE AND

188
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
CIVILITY.
>> Sean: DO YOU REMEMBER DURINGY

189
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
THE TEA PARTY RALLIES?

190
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
YOU WERE SPEAKING ABOUT THE S

191
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
MEDIA.
THE MEDIA WOULD SEARCH HIGH AND

192
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
LOW AND THEY WOULD BE LOOKING

193
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
FOR SOMETHING NEGATIVE THAT THE

194
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
TEA PARTY MOVEMENT WAS SAYING,

195
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
AND USUALLY THERE WERE KIDS ON

196
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
THEIR DADS' SHOULDERS AND THEY'D

197
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
HEAR PATRIOTIC SPEECHES AND SAY

198
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE AND GOD

199
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
BLESS AMERICA AND LEAVE THE

200
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
PLACE CLEANER THAN WHEN THEY

201
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
FOUND IT.

202
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I ASK YOU THROUGH THIS PRISM AS

203
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
THEY COMPARE THIS TO THE TEA

204
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
PARTY.

205
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
THERE WAS A VENDOR IN THE TENT,

206
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
A HOT DOG GUY, BEEN WORKING

207
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
THERE FOR 16 YEARS.

208
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I INTERVIEWED THIS MAN ON MY

209
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
RADIO PROGRAM.

210
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
THEY RUINED HIS EQUIPMENT,

211
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
KNOCKED OVER HIS FOOD, AND WELL,

212
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
LET ME PLAY THE REST FOR YOU.

213
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
>> THEY TRAMPLED THE TENT AND

214
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
EVERYTHING IR HAD.

215
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THEY WERE UNDER THE TENT,

216
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
TABLES.

217
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
HOT DOG BUNS, CHILI, ALL MY

218
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
UTENSILS, AND THEN THEY WERE

219
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
SAYING LIKE OKAY, MAKE A CHILI

220
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
DOG NOW.

221
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
EVERYTHING'S ON THE GROUND.

222
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
THEY CALLED ME THE N WORD.

223
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
THEY CALLED ME SCUM.

224
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
YOU'RE ON THE WRONG SIDE, AND

225
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
LIKE I SAID TO THEM, SEAN, THAT

226
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I WAS THERE TO DO A JOB.

227
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
PROSPERITY HIRED ME TO DO A JOB

228
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
TO SELL HOT DOGS.

229
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'M NOT HERE AND I'M NOT ON THAT

230
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
SIDE.
I'M JUST HERE.

231
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
SO IT REALLY DIDN'T MAKE A

232
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
DIFFERENCE TO THOSE GUYS.

233
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
>> Sean: YOU WERE HIRED TO DO A

234
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
JOB, AND THEY PURPOSELY STARTED

235
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
DESTROYING YOUR EQUIPMENT,

236
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
CALLING YOU THE N WORD AND UNCLE

237
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
TOM?
GO AHEAD.

238
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
>> THEY DIDN'T CARE.

239
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
THEY DIDN'T CARE.

240
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
>> Sean: THE MEDIA DIDN'T COVER

241
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
THET VIOLENCE.

242
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
IF THIS WAS A TEA PARTY RALLY,

243
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
WHAT WOULD THE REACTION BE IN

244
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
TH TE MEDIA?

245
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
>> WELL, I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT IT

246
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
WOULDOU BE.
THIS AGAIN IS PART OF THE TOTAL

247
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
BIAS OF THE MODERN MEDIA IN

248
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
PROTECTING THE LEFT EVERY WAY IT

249
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
CAN.
I WOULD HOPE THAT A COUPLE

250
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
CONSERVATIVE LAWYERS LISTENING

251
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
TO THAST ON YOUR RADIO SHOW TODY

252
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
WOULD GO TO HIM AND OFFER TO

253
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
REPRESENT HIM PRO BONO AND FILE

254
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
A SUIT FOR DAMAGES AGAINST THE

255
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
PEOPLE BECAUSE I SUSPECT THERE

256
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
ARE PICTURES OF WHO THEY ARE.

257
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I SUSPECT THAT THEY'RE

258
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
VULNERABLE TO BEING SUED, AND I

259
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
THINK WE NEED TO USE TO LEARN

260
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
THEE LEFT'S OWN TECHNIQUES

261
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
AGAINST IT.

262
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BE MUCH

263
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
MORE AGGRESSIVE IN RAISING THE

264
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
ISSUE OF VIOLENCE ON THE LEFT

265
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
AND IN DEMANDING THAT IT BE

266
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
POLICED, THAT PEOPLE BE ARRESTED

267
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
WHEN NECESSARY, AND THAT THE

268
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
PRESIDENT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY

269
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
HERE IN CALLING ON HIS OWN

270
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
ALLIES TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT AND

271
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
TO BE DISCIPLINED AND RECOGNIZE

272
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
THE RULE OF LAW.

273
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
>> Sean: HOW DO YOU INTERPRET

274
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
OCCUPY, THIS LABOR VIOLENCE, THE

275
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
G-20 SUMMIT?

276
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
HOW DO YOU INTERPRET THAT COMING

277
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
FROM THE LEFANT AND THE LANGUAGE

278
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
FROM THE LEFT WHICH NEITHER YOU

279
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
OR I WOULD EVER GET AWAY WITH?

280
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
>> I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE IS

281
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
A MOVEMENT ON OFFENSE WHICH IS

282
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
DESPERATELY TRYING TO CHANGE
AMERICA AND TRYING TO BROW BEAT

283
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
AND RIDICULE AND INTIMIDATE THE

284
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
REST OF US INTO PUTTING UP WITH

285
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
ANTI-DEMOCRATIC OPPRESSION BY

286
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
VERY MILITANT SMALL GROUPS.

287
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I THINK WE HAVE TO PROVE WHEN

288
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
NECESSARY THAT WE'LL USE THE

289
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
POLICE, WE'RE PREPARED WHEN

290
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
NECESSARY TO FILE LAWSUITS, AND

291
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
WE'RE GOING TO GO - AFTER THEM.

292
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
>> Sean: THESE ARE TWO BIG

293
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
LOSSES FOR THE PRESIDENT.

294
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I T MEAN, THE PRESIDENT, BIG

295
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
SUPPORTER OF BIG LABOR, WENT

296
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
THERE THE DAY BEFORE, AND THEN

297
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
THE LEGISLATURE, YOU KNOW,

298
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
PASSED RIGHT TO WORK WHICH, BY

299
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
THE WAY, ENDS LEGALIZED

300
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
STEALING.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT

301
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
RANK-AND-FILE MEMBERS.
I'M TALKING ABOUT UNION

302
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
LEADERSHIP.

303
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
THEY SHOULDN'T BEBO SPENDING

304
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
RANK-AND-FILE MONEY ON POLITICAL

305
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
CAMPAIGNS AND THEN SUSAN RICE.

306
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO STAND UP

307
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
FOR HER BUT THAT DIDN'T WORK,

308
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
EITHER.
AS IT WE INTERPRET THAT

309
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
RELATES TO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE

310
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
PRESIDENT?

311
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
>> WELL, LOOK.

312
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I THINK NEGOTIATIONS IS ANOTHER

313
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
TOPIC WE'LL TALK ABOUT, BUT I

314
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
WOULD SAY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS

315
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
THE NATURAL BALANCE OF THINGS.

316
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WON A VICTORY.

317
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
IT WAS A BIG VICTORY.

318
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
IT WAS AN IMPRESSIVE VICTORY.

319
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I DIDN'T THINK HE COULD DO IT.

320
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
HAVING WON THAT VICTORY, NOW

321
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
WE'RE BACK TO REALITY.

322
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
THE LONG TERM TREND IN AMERICA

323
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
TOWARDS GREATER PRODUCTIVITY,

324
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
LESS UNIONISM, PUBLIC REACTION

325
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
AGAINST EXULSR COMPULSORY UNIOND

326
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
AMBASSADOR RICE MISLED THE

327
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
ENTIRE COUNTRY IN PUBLIC AND SHE

328
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
COULDN'T WITHSTAND THE SCRUTINY

329
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
OF LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

330
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
>> Sean: WHEN WE COME BACK, SOME

331
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
OF HIS BEST FRIENDS THAT LECTURE

332
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
US ON THE NEED TO RAISE TAXES.

333
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
THEY'REER FINDING TAX SHELTERS N

334
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
PLACES LIKE BERMUDA.
ONE OF THEM

335
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
IS WARREN BUFFETT.

336
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
WE'LL CONTINUE WITH FORMER

337
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH.

338
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
>>> WOULD YOU GET YOUR JOB BACK

339
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
IF YOU WERE CAUGHT SMOKING A

340
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
LITTLE WEED AT WORK AND

341
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
DRINKING?
THES MEN DID ANTHESE MEN DID ANN

342
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
HELPED THEM.

343
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
THAT'S COMING UP NEXT.

344
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
LET'S GIVE THANKS -

345
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
FOR AN IDEA.

346
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
A GRAND IDEA CALLED AMERICA.

347
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
THE IDEA THAT
IF YOU WORK HARD,

348
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
IF YOU HAVE A DREAM,

349
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
IF YOU WORK WITH
YOUR NEIGHBORS...

350
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
YOU CAN DO MOST ANYTHING.

351
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
THIS LED TO OTHER IDEAS

352
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
LIKE LERTY

353
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
AND ROCK 'N' ROLL.

354
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
TO FREE MARKETS,

355
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
FREE ENTERPRISE,

356
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
AND FREE REFILLS.

357
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
IT PUT A MAN ON THE MOON

358
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
AND A PHONE IN YOUR POCKET.

359
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
OUR COUNTRY'S GONE THROUGH A LOT
OVER THE CENTURIES AND A HALF.

360
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
BUT THIS IDEA ISN'T FRAGILE.

361
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
WHEN TIMES GET TOUGH,
IT RALLIES US AS ONE.

362
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
EVEAND WHEN THEY DO,LE
BELTHE DREAM COMES TRUE.

363
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
WE'RE GRATEFUL
TO BE A PART OF IT.

364
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
>> SEAN: YOU MAY BE SHOCKED TO

365
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
>> Sean: YOU MAY BE SHOCKED TO

366
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
LEARN THAT ONE OF PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S SUPPORTERS IS NOT PAYING

367
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
HIS FAIR SHARE IN TAXES.

368
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE EXECUTIVE

369
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
CHAIRMAN OF GOOGLE, ERIC

370
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
SCHMIDT.
HIS NET WORTH RUMORED TO BE

371
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
APPROACHING $8 BILLION,

372
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
ACCORDING TO FORBES MAGAZINE,

373
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
AND DESPITE BEING AN OBAMA DONOR

374
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
AND SERVING ON THE PRESIDENT'S

375
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
COUNCIL OF ADVISORS ON SCIENCE

376
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
AND TECHNOLOGY, MR. SCHMIDT IS

377
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
ONE OF THOSE LIBERALS THAT FALLS

378
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
INTO THE CATEGORY OF DO AS I

379
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
SAY, NOT AS I DO.

380
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
HERE'S WHY.
IN RECENT DAYS HIS COMPANY,

381
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
GOOGLE, HAS MADE HEADLINES FOR,

382
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
WELL, NOT EXACTLY PAYING THEIR

383
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
FAIR SHARE.

384
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
ITY TURNS OUT THAT SCHMIDT AT TE

385
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
HELM OF THE COMPANY WHEN

386
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY

387
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
BLOOMBERG NEWS, COUL GOOGLE AVOD

388
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
ABOUT $2 BILLION IN WORLDWIDE

389
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
INCOME TAXES IN 2011 BY SHIFTING

390
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
9.8 BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUES

391
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
INTO A BERMUDA SHELL COMPANY,

392
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
ALMOST DOUBLE THE TOTAL FROM

393
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
THREE YEARS BEFORE ACCORDING TO

394
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
FILINGS.
NOW, WHILE THE REPORT NOTES THAT

395
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
THE MONEY WAS MOVED AROUND

396
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
LEGALLY, THIS SEEMS LIKE A

397
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO

398
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NON-STOP

399
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
LECTURES ABOUT CORPORATE GREED

400
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
AND PAYING YOUR FAIR SHARE.

401
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
MR. SCHMIDT HAS SINCE RESPONDED

402
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
TO THE CONTROVERSY SAYING HE'S,

403
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
QUOTE, PROUD OF HIS TAX MOVES.

404
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
EVEN MORE INTERESTING,

405
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
MR. SCHMIDT WANTS RUMORED TO BET

406
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
THE TOP OF THE PRESIDENT'S

407
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
CABINET RECRUITING CLASS FOR A

408
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
SECOND TERM.

409
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
ALTHOUGH S HE PREEMPTIVELY

410
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
DECLINED SUCH AN OFFER, SOME

411
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
POSITIONS THROWN AROUND WERE

412
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
TREASURY OR THE

413
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
SECRETARY OF BUSINESS.

414
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
HERE WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT'S

415
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
BILLIONAIREHE BUDDY AT GOOGLE

416
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
HELPING TO SHELTER HIS MONEY IN

417
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
A SHELL COMPANY IN BERMUDA IN

418
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
ORDER TO AVOID PAYING HIS FAIR

419
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
SHARE AND BEING OFFERED A

420
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
CABINET POST.

421
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
NOT ONLY THAT, WARREN BUFFETT,

422
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
HAS A PIECEINE

423
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
ABOUT HIM.

424
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF TAX DOLLARS

425
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
HE'S NOT PAYING BECAUSE HE'S

426
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
USING EVERY LOOP HOLE IMAGINABLE

427
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
NOT TO PAY.

428
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
A LITTLE IRONIC, HUH?

429
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
>>IT I THINK THE HOUSE REPUBLICS

430
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
OUGHT TO PASS THE GOOGLE BUFFETT

431
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
TAX BILL PROVIDED THAT EVERY

432
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO

433
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
AT LEAST AS MANY DEDUCTIONS AND

434
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
LOOPHOLES AS WARREN BUFFETT AND

435
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
ERIC SCHMIDT.

436
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
WE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

437
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
LIBERALS BEING HUMAN AND TRYING

438
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND SIMPLY

439
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
SUGGEST THAT EVERYBODY ELSE

440
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
OUGHT TO HAVE THE SAME RIGHT.

441
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
THAT SHOULD BE PART OF OUR

442
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
ANSWER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S

443
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
CONSTANT DEMAND FOR HIGHER

444
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
TAXES.
THESE ARE HIS ALLIES.

445
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
THEY CLEARLY ARE DOING WHAT THEY

446
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
THINK WHAT IS LEGAL AND IT IS

447
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
LEGAL.
WE SHOULD EXTEND THAT LEGALITY

448
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
TO THE MIDDLE CLASS.

449
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
IT WOULD BE VERY EDUCATIONAL TO

450
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
SUDDENLY CALL A HEARING AND ASK

451
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
BUFFETT TO COME IN AND EDUCATE

452
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
THE WHOLE COUNTRY ON HOW THE

453
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
MIDDLE CLASS CAN USE EVERY LOOP

454
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
HOLE TO AVOID PAYING TAXES.

455
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
>> Sean: BY THE WAY, 36 OF

456
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
PRESIDENTSI OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE

457
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
OFFICE STAFF, THEY 0 TH OWE THE

458
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
COUNTRY $833 IN BACK TAXES.

459
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
FEDERAL EMPLOYEES OWE BILLIONS

460
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
IN UNPAID TAXES.

461
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
WHY IF THAT WAS YOU OR ME,

462
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
HANDCUFFED, PERP WALKED, MADE A

463
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
MODEL CITIZEN BEFORE THE NATION.

464
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I THINK THERE WOULD BE A BIT OF

465
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
A DOUBLE STANDARD IN HANDLING

466
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
SOME OF THAT.

467
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
>> WELL, THIS IS A CENTRAL PART

468
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
OF THE CONSERVATIVE ARGUMENT

469
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
ABOUT BIG GOVERNMENT.

470
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
BIG GOVERNMENT'S INHERENTLY

471
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
UNFAIR.

472
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
IT INHERENTLY HAS ADVANTAGES FOR

473
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
ITS FRIENDS.

474
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
IT INHERENTLY TAKES CARE OF

475
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
INSIDERS CREATING A SYSTEM WHICH

476
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE RULE OF

477
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
LAW AND IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF A

478
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
FREE SOCIETY.

479
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
THAT'S WHY CONSERVATIVES

480
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
HISTORICALLY HAVE ARGUED FOR

481
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
SMALLER GOVERNMENT.

482
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
THESE KIND OFES THINGS ARE ALMOT

483
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
INEVIDENT ABLE BECAUSE PEOPLE

484
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
WHO HAVE POWER TAKE CARE OF

485
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
THEMSELVES.

486
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
THEY TAKE CARE OF THEIR FRIENDS.

487
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
>> Sean: I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
THE HOUSE LEADERSHIP, THERE'S A

488
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
LOT OF IN-FIGHTING GOING ON.

489
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
SOME TEA PARTY CONSERVATIVES ARE

490
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
CLAIMING THEY'VE BEEN PURGED OF

491
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
COMMITTEES FOR CERTAIN T VOTES.

492
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS.

493
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE

494
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
PRESIDENT, YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING

495
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
IT.

496
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
YOUR ADVICE WAS BETTER THAN

497
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
MINE.
I SAID SO AT THE TIME.

498
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
YOU SAID PASS A SERIES OF BILLS.

499
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'VE BEEPAN WAITING.

500
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET.

501
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
DO YOU THINK THEY STILL HAVE

502
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
TIME TO DO THAT?

503
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
>> SURE, THEY HAVE TIME TO DO

504
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
IT, BUT I THINK THEY'VE BEEN

505
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
CAUGHT UP IN A -- I THINK A

506
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
LOSING PROPOSITION.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET A REAL

507
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
AGREEMENT OUT OF BARACK OBAMA

508
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
BEFORE THE EN AD OF THE YEAR.

509
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
HE JUST WON AN ELECTION.

510
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
HE'SUS FEELING LIKE HE'S DOMINA.

511
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
HE HAS WHAT THE JAPANESE USED TO

512
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
CALL VICTORY DISEASE.

513
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
HE'S MAKING OUTLANDISH

514
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
SUGGESTIONS SUCH AS ELIMINATING

515
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
THE DEBT CEILING PERMANENTLY SO

516
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
THE PRESIDENT CAN RUN UP ANY

517
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
LEVEL OF DEFICIT HE WANTS TO.

518
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR THE

519
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
HOUSE TO PASS -- I WOULD PASS

520
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
TWO BILLS.

521
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'D PASS A COMPLETE EXTENSION OF

522
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
EVERY SINGLE TAX CUT AND THEN I

523
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
WOULD PASSGL AN EXTENSION OF EVY

524
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
TAX CUT EXCEPT THE RATES AT THE

525
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
VERY TOP, PASS BOTH OF THEM,

526
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
SEND THEM TO THE SENATE AND SAY

527
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH ANYTHING

528
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
ELSE RIGHT NOW.

529
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
WE'RE NOT PLAYING GAMES RIGHT

530
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
NOW.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE MIDDLE

531
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
CLASS DOESN'T FACE A TAX

532
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
INCREASE.

533
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
YOU PICK.

534
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
YOU PASS SOMETHING, GET IT DONE.

535
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
NOW IT'S UP TO THE DEMOCRATS AND

536
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
THE SENATE AND THE PRESIDENT.

537
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
YOU ARE NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

538
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
MIDDLE CLASS TAX INCREASE.

539
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
>> I HAVE A NAME FOR THE BILL.

540
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN COME UP

541
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
WITH A BETTER ONE.

542
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I HATE WHEN YOU TOP ME, BUT IF

543
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
IT'S BETTER, I GO ALONG WITH A

544
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
GOOD IDEA, NOT WHO IS RIGHT.

545
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
HOW ABOUT THE STOP STEALING FROM

546
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
OUR KIDS AND GRAND KIDS BILL OF

547
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
2012?
>> THAT'S THE SPENDING BILL.

548
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
THAT COMES NEXT.

549
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
>> Sean: NO, NO, NO.

550
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I WANT THAT FIRST.

551

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
A LOT OF OUR CARS AREN'T VERY

733
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
GOOD.
WE'VE HAD OUR LUNCH EATEN BY

734
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
FOREIGN CAR MAKERS.

735
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I WORKED IN A UNION FACTORY IN

736
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
COLLEGE.
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE UNION

737
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE A BAD

738
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
EMPLOYEE.
IT DOES MEAN, HOWEVER, THAT MANY

739
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
BAD EMPLOYEES, MEDIOCRE

740
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
EMPLOYEES ARE PROTECTED BY THE

741
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
UNION.

742
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
THIS IN THE END ONLY HURTS

743
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
UNIONS.
THERE'S A REASON THAT DETROIT

744
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
WHICH IS ONE OF U THE BIRTHPLACS

745
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
OF THE LABOR UNION BECAME A

746
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
RIGHT TO WORK STATE THIS WEEK

747
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
BECAUSE OF NONSENSE LIKE THIS.

748
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
IT'S SELF DISCREDITING FOR

749
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
UNIONS TO PROTECT PEOPLE WHO

750
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
WORK WITH DANGEROUS HEAVY

751
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
MACHINERY WHO ARE GETTING HIGH

752
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
ON THEIR BREAKS.
COME ON.

753
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
>> EVEN IF YOU ACCEPT THAT

754
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
REASONING WHICH I DON'T, BUT IF

755
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
YOU DO, IT ISN'T THAT THE

756
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
SITUATION IN DETROIT IS GOING TO

757
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
LEAD TO THE DECLINE OF AMERICAN

758
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
CITIES.

759
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
>
>> Sean: WHY CAN'T YOUEC LOOK AT

760
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
SOMETHING AS BASICS AS THAT AND

761
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
SAY YOU'VE GOT FIRE THOSE GUYS?

762
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
THEY DO NOT REFLECT EVERY

763
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
WORKER.

764
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
AS A MATTER OF FACT, GOOD

765
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
WORKERS, THEIR NAME AND

766
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
REPUTATION IS HURT BECAUSE OF

767
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
SCENES LIKE THIS AND PEOPLE

768
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
SEEING THIS.
>> I'M SAYING OWNERSHIP.

769
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
THE MANAGEMENT AND OWNERSHIP

770
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH

771
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
THOSE SAME WORKERS AND THE

772
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
UNIONS REPRESENTING THEM.

773
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
THEY SET UP A PROCESS.

774
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

775
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
>> Sean: WHY ARE THERE ALL OF

776
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
THESE -- I'LL THROW THIS TO

777
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
TUCKER.

778
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
LOOK AT MISSISSIPPI AND

779
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
TENNESSEE AND ALABAMA OF.

780
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
ALL THESE STATES, GUESS WHAT?

781
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
NOW THEY'RE BUILDING CARS.

782
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
THEY'RE BUILDING CARS IN INDIA

783
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
AND OTHER CUPS.

784
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
UNIONS DON'T -- SOME UNIONS DO,

785
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
BUT A LOT OF UNIONS HAVE SOLD

786
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
OUT THEIR OWN WORKERS.

787
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
ONE OF THE REASONS YOU SEE

788
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
DEPRESSED WAGES IN THE COUNTRY

789
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
IS BECAUSE D OF LOW SKILLED

790
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
IMMIGRATION WHICH IS SUPPORTED
BY THE UNIONS FOR REASONS THAT

791
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
ARE NOT CLEAR AT ALL.

792
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
ACTING AGAINST THEIR OWN

793
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
INTEREST AT THE BEHEST OF THE

794
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH THEY ARE

795
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
THE MOST FAITHFUL OF GET THE

796
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
VOTE OUT.

797
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
THEY'RE HURT THEIR OWN

798
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
MEMBERSHIP.

799
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
>> Sean: WE HAVE THIS VIOLENCE

800
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
TAKE PLACE.
YOU SAW THE VIDEO, AND IF IT WAS

801
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
A TEA PARTY MEMBER, I TALKED TO

802
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
THISLK HOT DOG GUY WHO WILL BE N

803
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
GRETA, BY THE WAY, LATER

804
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
TONIGHT, AND I JUST PLAYED HIM

805
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
WITH NEWT GINGRICH USING THE N

806
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
WORD.

807
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
THE N WORD WAS USED AGAINST HIM.

808
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
HE WAS CALLED AN UNCLE TOM.

809
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
HIS EQUIPMENT WAS RUINED.

810
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
HIS FOODOD WAS KNOCKED OVER.

811
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
IF THIS HAPPENED AT TEA PARTY

812
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
RALLY, NOT A LABORALLY, IT WOULT

813
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
WOULD BEES FRONT PAGE NEWS.

814
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?

815
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
G-20 SUMMIT, VIOLENCE.

816
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
LABOR MOVEMENT?

817
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
THIS VIOLENT INCIDENT THIS WEEK.

818
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
NO PROMINENT LIBERAL SPEAKS OUT.

819
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
WHY?

820
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
>> I'M A PRODUCT OF THE SOCIAL

821
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
JUSTICE MOVEMENT FOR CIVIL

822
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
RIGHTS IN THE COUNTRY WHICH WAS

823
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
A NON-VIOLENT MOVEMENT.

824
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
THOSE WHO CAME OUT FOR VON

825
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
VIOLENCE, VIOLENCE WAS VISITED

826
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
UPON THEM.

827
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
THEY HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO PAY

828
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
THE CONSEQUENCE FOR BEING

829
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
NON-VIOLENT.
IN THE SAME WAY WHEN PEOPLE

830
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
BREAK THE LAW, THEY'VE GOT TO GO

831
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
TO JAIL.

832
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
NOW, WHETHER THE MEDIA

833
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
CRITICIZES THEM --

834
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
>> Sean: IF A TEA PARTY MEMBER

835
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
USED THE N WORD AGAINST A GUY

836
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
THAT'S BEEN SELLING HOT DOGS FOT

837
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
--E  NO REPORTS ON ANY MAJOR

838
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
NETWORKS.

839
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
>> I'M NOT FOR ITJO UNDER ANY

840
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
CIRCUMSTANCES, SO I NEVER

841
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
CONDONE THE N WORD UNDER ANY

842
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
CIRCUMSTANCES.
>> Sean: THEY RUINED HIS

843
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
EQUIPMENT.
>> THE OTHER THING THAT WAS

844
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
MENTIONED A LITTLE EARLIER THAT
HAS TO BEHAME RESPONDED TO IS TE

845
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
ROLE OF UNIONS IN THE COUNTRY.

846
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
IN CIVIL RIGHTS, CHILD LABOR

847
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
LAWS, WORKPLACE SAFETY AND

848
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
OVERTIME PAY.

849
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
>> Sean: WAS IT WRONG TO SAY TO

850
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
PEOPLE YOU CAPTURE WORK UNLESS

851
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
YOU JOIN A UNION, PAY DUES, AND

852
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
THAT MONEY IS USED FOR A

853
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
POLITICAL PARTY?

854
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
>> IF IT GOES THROUGH THE

855
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
DEMOCRATIC PROCESSOU AND PASSEDY

856
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000

>> Sean: SO YOU'RE NOT PRO

859
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
CHOICE?
>> I'M P FOR ORGANIZED LABOR.

860
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
>> Sean: WOW.
SO W THA FORCE PEOPLE, TAKE THER

861
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000

862
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
NOT.

ABUSED.
>> Sean: THANKS FOR BEING WITH

868
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
US.
STILL AHEAD, WE COUNT THE MANY

869
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
WAYS THAT THE MEDIA BIAS IS ON

870
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000

>>> ALSO, HARRY BELAFONTE IS

871
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
LOBBING SOME IDIOTIC AND

872

INCENDIARY COMMENTS.
THIS TIME HE'S OFFERING

873
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SOME ADVICE ON

874
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
DEALING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND

875
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT AN ESPN

876
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
ANALYST IS SAYING ABOUT REDSKINS

877

BOIL.

881
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
WE HAVE THE TAPE.

882
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
WE'LL PLAY IT STRAIGHT AHEAD

883
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
COMING UP.

S.
COPD INCLUDES CHRONIC
BRONCHITIS AND EMPHYSEMA.

886
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
SPIRIVA HELPS CONTROL
MY COPD SYMPTOMS

887
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
BY KEEPING MY AIRWAYS

888
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
OPEN FOR 24 HOURS.

889
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
PLUS, IT REDUCES COPD FLARE-UPS.

890
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
SPIRIVA IS THE ONLY ONCE-DAILY

891
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
INHALED COPD MAINTENANCE
TREATMENT THAT DOES BOTH.

892
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
SPIRIVA HANDIHALER TIOTROPIUM
BROMIDE INHALATION POWDER

893
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
DOES NOT REPLACE FAST-ACTING
INHALERS FOR SUDDEN SYMPTOMS.

894
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU HAVE
KIDNEY PROBLEMS, GLAUCOMA,

895
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
TROUBLE URINATING, OR
AN ENLARGED PROSTATE.

896
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
THESE MAY WORSEN WITH SPIRIVA.

897
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
DISCUSS ALL MEDICINES
YOU TAKE, EVEN EYE DROPS.

898
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
STOP TAKING SPIRIVA AND SEEK
IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP

899
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
IF YOUR BREATHING
SUDDENLY WORSENS,

900
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
YOUR THROAT OR TONGUE
SWELLS, YOU GET HIVES,

901
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
VISION CHANGES OR EYE PAIN,
OR PROBLEMS PASSING URINE.

902
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
DRY MOUTH AND CONSTIPATION.

903
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
NOTHING CAN REVERSE COPD

904
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
SPIRIVA HELPS ME BREATHE BETTER.

905
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
(BLOWING SOU)

906
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT SPIRIVA.

907
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Is bigger than we think ...
Sometimelike the flu.fer from

908
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
With aches, fever and chills-
the flu's a really big deal.

909
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So why treat it like
it's a little cold?

910
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
There's something
that works differently

911
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
than over-the-counter

Prescription for flu.

931

>> Sean: BACK TO HANNITY.

932
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
EVEN THOUGH 59 MILLIONS VOTED

933
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
AGAINST PRESIDENT OBAMA ON

934
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
ELECTION DAY, HIS SUPPORTERS

935
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
CANNOT SEEM TO COMPREHEND WHY

936
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
HE'S RECEIVING SUCH OPPOSITION

937
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
TO HIS RADICAL LIBERAL JE AGEND.

938
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
ONE OF HIS LONG TIME ALLIES,

939
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
HARRY BELAFONTE, HAS SOME

940
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
DOWNRIGHT DISTURBING ADVICE

941
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
ABOUT HOW OBAMA SHOULD DEAL WITH

942
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
DISSENTERS.
HE WAS ASKED ABOUT REPUBLICANS

943
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
PUSHING REFORM TO THE COUNTRY'S

944
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
BROKEN I ENTITLEMENT SYSTEM.

945
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS IS WHAT

946
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
HE SAID.
>> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THEIR

947
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
MATURITY DECLARED THEMSELVES

948
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
FULLY.
WE WANT WHAT BARACK OBAMA IS

949
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
TALKING ABOUT.
WE WANT THE COUNTRY TO GO IN

950
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
THAT DIRECTION AND WHAT

951
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
FASCINATES ME IS

952
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
THAT IN THE
FACE OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS

953
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
EXPRESSING THEIRIC DESIRE, THE

954
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
WHOLE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT

955
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
DEFININGIC ITS GAME THAT THERE

956
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
SHOULD BE THIS LINGERING

957
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
INFESTATION OF REALLY CORRUPT

958
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL TRYING TO

959
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
DISMANTLE THE WISHES OF THE

960
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
PEOPLE, THE MANDATE THAT HAS

961
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
BEEN GIVEN TO BARACK OBAMA AND I

962
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE THEY WANT.

963
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR BARACK

964
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
OBAMA TO DO IS TO ORGANIZE A

965
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
THIRD WORLD DICTATOR TO PUT ALL

966
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
THESE GUYS IN JAIL FOR VIOLATING

967
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
THE AMERICAN DESIRE.

968
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
>> YEAH.

969
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
THROW THEM IN JAIL.

970
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
THAT'S HIS SOLUTION.

971
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA, ACT LIKE A

972
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
DICTATOR.

973
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
JOINING MEOR NOW WITH REACTION,

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
THE CO HOST OF THE FIVE, KILL

BERKIMBERLY GUILFOYLE.

976
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
HE SAID THAT ABOUT NELSON

977
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
MANDELA.
HE SAID WE SALUTE YOU AND WANT

978
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
TO SEE YOU Y AND YOUR FELLOW

979
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
POLITICAL PRISONERS FREED.

980
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
REACTION?

981
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
>> WELL, I THINK THAT HARRY

982
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
BELAFONTE WAS JUST SAYING WHAT

983
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
HE SAID IN JEST.

984
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
YOU KNOWFO HE WAS JOKING.

985
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
>> Sean: IN JEST?

986
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
>> HE WAS JOKING AROUND.

987
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
HE DIDN'T MEAN IT.

988
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
>> Sean: THERE'S A WHOLE LIST OF

989
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
THINGS HE SAID IN JEST.

990
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
>> DO YOU HAVE THE LIST OF HIM

991
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
CRITICIZING PRESIDENT OBAMA

992
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
WHICH HE DID AND THE RIGHT WING

993
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
LOVED THAT.

994
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
>> Sean: HE COMPARED THEEA

995
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
ROSENBERG'S TO POLITICAL

996
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
PRISONERS AND COMPARED THE BUSH

997
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
ADMINISTRATION AND THE DHS SO

998
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
THE GESTAPO.

999
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
>> AND HE CRITICIZED OBAMA, TOO.

1000
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
AND JAY-Z AND BEYONCE.

1001
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
>> Sean: HE SUPPORTS A COP

1002
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
KILLER.
I MEAN, HOW MORE EXTREME CAN YOU

1003
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
GET?
>> WELL, I THINK HE --

1004
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
>

1005
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
>> Sean: YOU DON'T SEEM FAZED AT

1006
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
ALL.
>> HE WAS SAYING IT IN JEST.

1007
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
HE DID NOT REALLY MEAN THAT.

1008
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
>> Sean: EVERY DUMB THING HE

1009
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
SAYS NOW IS IN JEST?

1010
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I SAY DUMB THINGS, PEOPLE START

1011
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
CAMPAIGNS TO SILENCE ME.

1012
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
>> THEY DO BECAUSE THEY KNOW

1013
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.

1014
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
HE'S PREPARING FOR A ROLE.

1015
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
THIS IS A SCRIPT THAT'S

1016
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
UNBELIEVABLE, THE STUFF HE HAD

1017
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
TO SAY.
WHEN HE WAS CREATING PRESIDENT

1018
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
OBAMA, IT'S BECAUSE HE WASN'T

1019
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
CHAVEZ ENOUGH.

1020
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
HE DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH IN HIS

1021
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
SOCIALIST AGENDA.

1022
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

1023
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
OBAMA'S AGENDA WASN'T LIBERAL

1024
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
ENOUGH.
HE'S QUITE SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT

1025
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
HE'S SAYING.

1026
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
THIS IS THE DIRECTION HE

1027
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
BELIEVESS  THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE

1028
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
GOING IN.

1029
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
HE SEEMS TO DISREGARD THE

1030
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
PLEURALTY OF THE COUNTRY THAT,

1031
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
IN FACT, DIDN'T WANT PRESIDENT

1032
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
OBAMA TO BE REELECTED AND

1033
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
OUTRIGHT REJECTED HIS LIBERAL

1034
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
AGENDA.

1035
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
THAT SEEMS TO HAVE FALLEN UPON

1036
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
DEAF AREAS OR AT LEAST HARRY

1037
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
BELAFONTE IS NOT LISTENING.

1038
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
>> Sean: DO YOU LIKE RG-III HAS

1039
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
MUCH AS I DO?

1040
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I MEAN, I'M SERIOUS, AND I'M A

1041
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
JETS FAN.
AREIT YOU AS IMPRESSED WITH HIMS

1042
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I AM AS A PERSON, AS AN

1043
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
INDIVIDUAL?
>>IV RIGHT.

1044
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
>> Sean: ISN'T HE AMAZING?

1045
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
HE WAS ONCE ASKED ABOUT WHO HE

1046
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
FEARS.
HE SAID GOD.

1047
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I FEAR GOD.

1048
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
>> THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER.

1049
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
>> Sean: HE'S A GOOD PERSON,
GOOD HEART, GOOD SOUL.

1050
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
HERE'S WHATHA ESPN, THIS ANALYST

1051
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
HAD TO SAY ABOUT HIM, ROB

1052
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
PARKER.

1053
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
LISTEN TOB THIS.

1054
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
>> MY QUESTION WHICH IS JUST A

1055
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
STRAIGHT HONEST QUESTION.

1056
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
>> YES, SIR.

1057
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
>> WAS HE A CORN BALL BROTHER.

1058
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
>> WHAT DOESTH THAT MEAN?

1059
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
>> HE'S NOT REALLY, OKAY.

1060
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
HE DOES THE THING BUT HE'S NOT

1061
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
REALLY DOWN WITH THE CAUSE.

1062
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
HE'S NOT ONE OF US.

1063
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
HE'S KIND OF BLACK.

1064
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
HE'S NOT REALLY LIKE THE GUY YOU

1065
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
REALLY WANT TO HANG OUT WITH

1066
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
BECAUSE HE'S OFF TO SOMETHING.

1067
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
>> WHY IS THAT YOUR QUESTION?

1068
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
>> WELL, BECAUSE THAT'S JUST HOS

1069
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT HIM.

1070
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE A I KEEP

1071
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
HEARING THESE THINGS.

1072
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
WE ALL KNOW HE HAS A WHITE

1073
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
FIANCE.
THERE'S A ALL THIS TALK ABOUT HS

1074
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
A REPUBLICAN WHICH THERE'S NO

1075
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
INFORMATION AT ALL.

1076
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I'M JUST TRYING TO DIG DEEPER

1077
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
INTO WHY HE HAS AN ISSUE.

1078
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
>> Sean: HE DOESN'T HAVE THE

1079
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
ISSUE.
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

1080
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
IT'S AWFUL.

1081
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
IT'S A HATE-FILLED SPEECH.

1082
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
THOSE ARE RACIST COMMENTS.

1083
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
WHY IS HE SAYING THAT.

1084
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
HE HAS A WHITE FIANCE.

1085
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
HE'S A REPUBLICAN SO HE WANTS TO

1086
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
DISAVOW AND SAY HE'S NOT

1087
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN?

1088
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
IT'S VERY STRANGE BEHAVIOR AND

1089
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
REALLY RUDE.

1090
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
>> Sean: REACTION?

00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
THEY GOT THROUGH EATING THE HOT

1266
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
DOGS, THEY TURNED OVER THE

1267
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
COFFEE URN.

1268
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
BY THAT TIME THE PROTESTERS WERE

1269
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
TEARING THE TENT DOWN, AND SO

1270
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
THE GROUNDS KEEPER OF THE

1271
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
CAPITAL SAID CLINT, YOU HAVE TO

1272
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
GET OUT OF HERE.

1273
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
THEY'RE TEARING THE TENT DOWN.

1274
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
>> Sean: THEN THEY CALLED HIM

1275
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
THE N WORD RIGLEHT TO HIS FACE.

1276
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
REACTION.
WHY DIDN'T THE MEDIA COVER THAT?

1277
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
>>TI WELL, I THINK YOUR VIEWERS

1278
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
NEED TO THINK ABOUT TWO THINGS.

1279
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
ONE IS REMEMBER THE DOZENS, THE

1280
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
HUNDREDS OF STORIES THAT WE'VE

1281
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
WATCHEDTH SINCE 2009 ABOUT THE

1282
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
MENACING NATURE OF THE TEA

1283
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
PARTY, AND A ACCUSATIONS

1284
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
MADE ABOUT THE TEA PARTY.

1285
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
NEVER MIND THAT THERE WAS NO

1286
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
EVIDENCE EVER TO BACK UP THE N

1287
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
WORD WITH THE TEA PARTY OR GABI

1288
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
GIFFORDS OR SO MANY OF THE

1289
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
SHOOTING IN COLORADO, ALL

1290
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
THESE THINGS ATTRIBUTED TO THE

1291
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
AT A PARTY.

1292
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
NONE OF IT WAS TRUE.

1293
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
THIS MEDIAS WAS OBSESSIVE ABOUT

1294
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
THE NEED FOR CIVILITY IN THE

1295
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
AMERICAN PUBLIC CONVERSATION.

1296
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
OKAY.
SO NOW THE TABLES ARE TURNED,

1297
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
AND NOW YOU'VE GOT OUTRIGHT

1298
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
VIOLENCE Y BEING PERPETRATORD.

1299
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
>> Sean: AND RACISM.

1300
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
>> BUT SEAN, WHAT'S KEY HERE IS

1301
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
THAT REPORTERS WERE THERE.

1302
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
THAT SCENE IS CRAWLING WITH

1303
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
JOURNALISTS.
THEY'RE ALL THERE.

1304
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
THEY'RE SEEING IT WITH THEIR OWN

1305
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
EYES.
THEY MISSED THE

1306
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
STORY.

1307
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY DIDN'T HAVE

1308
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
THE FOOTAGE.
IT'S NOT LIKE NOBODY TOLD THEM

1309
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
ABOUT IT.
THEY WERE THERE, THEY SAW IT,

1310
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
AND STILL THEY WITH HELD IT FROM

1311
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
THE PUBLIC.

1312
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
>> Sean: ALL RIGHT.

1313
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
SO THERE WAS NO REFERENCE IN THE

1314
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
MAIN STREAM MEDIA THIS WEEK TO

1315
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
THE VIOLENCE THAT OCCURRED.

1316
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
YOU RIGHTLY POINT OUT THAT THEY

1317
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
WERE THERE, SO WE DECIDED TO GO

1318
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
BACK AND WE DID A LITTLE SEARCH.

1319
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
NOW, YOU HAVE A HUNDRED PERCENT

1320
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
PEACEFUL MOVEMENT KNOWN AS THE

1321
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
TEA PARTY.
THEY SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW.

1322
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
THEY COULDN'T FIND RACISM OR

1323
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
VIOLENCE, BUT THAT'S NOT HOW

1324
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
THEY PORTRAYED IT.

1325
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
THE SAME PEOPLE THAT IGNORED

1326
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
THIS MAN'S STORY AND THE

1327
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
VIOLENCE.

1328
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
LISTEN TO THIS.
>> A T YEAR-LONG DEBATE THAT HAS

1329
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
BEEN MEAN FROMND THE START TURND

1330
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
EVEN NASTIER YESTERDAY.

1331
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
DEMONSTRATORS PROTESTING THE

1332
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000

CONGRESS SHOUTING KILL THE BILL

AND MADE IN THE USSR.

1335
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
>> OPPONENTS OF THE BILL HAVE

1336
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
BEEN OUT TODAY.

1337
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
SOME OF THEM PULLED OUT ALL THE

1338
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
STOPS.
PROTESTERS ROAMING WASHINGTON

1339
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
TON, SOME OF THEM INCREASINGLY

1340
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
EMOTIONAL, YELLING SLURS AND

1341
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
EPITHETS.
>> WHEN HAMAS OR HEZBOLLAH DOES

1342
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
IT, IT'S CALLED TERRORISM.

1343
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
WHY SHOULD THE ASTRO TURF GROUPS

1344
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
ORGANIZING ON BEHALF OF THE

1345
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
HEALTH CARE MOVEMENT BE VIEWED

1346
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
DIFFERENTLY.
THEY'RE BEING CARRIE COMPARED TR

1347
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
AND THE HOLOCAUST.

1348
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
>> Sean: TERRORISTS, SLURS,

1349
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
MEAN, EPITHETS, AND THEY COULD

1350
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
NOT PRODUCE IT.

1351
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
THERES  WAS A $100,000 REWARD.

1352
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
>> IT'S TIME FOR THE TEA PARTY

1353
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000

1354
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000

GO TO THESE NETWORKS.

1357
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
IT'S TIME FOR THERE TO BE A

1358
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
NATIONAL OUTRAGE AGAINST WHAT

1359
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
THEY'RE DOING.

1360
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
>> Sean: BRENT BOZELL, THANKS

1361
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
FOR BEING WITH US.

>>>CO WHEN WE COME BACK, THERE'A

1363
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
FAMILY THATHA NEEDS YOUR HELP.

1364
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
THIS MARINE, JON HAMMAR, IS

1365
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
BEING HELD RIGHT NOW AND HAS

1366
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
BEEN SINCE AUGUST IN A MEXICAN

1367
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000

HE TRIED TO LEGALLY REGISTER AN

1368
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
ANTIQUE RIFLEIF IN MEXICO.

1369
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
HE WAS ENROUTE TO COSTA RICA.

1370
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
HE HAS BEEN LOCKED UP FOR FOUR

1371
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
MONTHS AND MEXICAN AUTHORITIES

1372
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
REFUSE TO RELEASE HIM.

1373
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
HIS PARENTS JOIN ME NEXT, AND

1374
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000

ETHING
ALONG THE WAY.

1376
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
THIS IS THE AGE OF KNOWING
WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF.

1377
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
SO, WHY LET
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION

1378
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
GET IN YOUR WAY?

1379
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
ABOUT VIAGRA.

1380
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
20 MILLION MEN ALREADY HAVE.

1381
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
ASK IF YOUR HEART
IS HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR SEX.

1382
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
DO NOT TAKE VIAGRA IF YOU TAKE
NITRATES FOR CHEST PAIN;

1383
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
IT MAY CAUSE AN UNSAFE DROP
IN BLOOD PRESSURE.

1384
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
HEADACHE, FLUSHING,

1385

00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
TO AVOID LONG-TERM INJURY,
SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP

LASTING MORE THAN FOUR HOURS.

1388
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
STOP TAKING VIAGRA
AND CALL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY

1389
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
IF YOU EXPERIENCE
A SUDDEN DECREASE OR LOSS

1390
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
IN VISION OR HEARING.

1391
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
THIS IS THE AGE
OF TAKING ACTION.

1392
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
VIAGRA.

1393
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR.

1394
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
SEE IF AMERICA'S
MOST PRESCRIBED ED TREATMENT

1395
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000

HE WAS ARRESTED FOR CARING THIS

1405

ANTIQUE SHOTGUN THAT WAS OWNED

1406

BY HIS GRANDFATHER.

NOW, ACCORDING TO REPORTS, JON

1408
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000

1413
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
THING IN MEXICO.

1414
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE THE

1415

IT'S A RIDICULOUS CASE.

1521
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I THINK THEY KNOW IT'S A

1522
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
RIDICULOUS CASE BECAUSE IT WAS

1523
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
AN ACCIDENT.

1524
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000

MILITARY HAS SENT LETTERS TO THE

1526
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
JUDGES AND THE PROSECUTORS

1527
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
SAYING THIS GUN IS NOT ON THE

CONSIDER
