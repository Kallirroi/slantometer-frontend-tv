1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
THERE IS NO OFFICIAL SERVICE

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
HAPPENING.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
THEY DON'T INTEND TO HAVE ONE
THROUGH TONIGHT.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
BUT THEY SAY THEY' HAD MANY

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
PEOPLE COME THROUGH AND THEY ARE

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
TRYING TO BE ONE OF THE MANY

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE IN THE

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
COMMUNITY CAN GO AND HEAL.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
POLICE ARE TALKING TO EVERYONE

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
WHO KNEW THE SHOOTER.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
ALSO POLICE SAY THEY'RE GOING TO

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
TALK TO THE ONE ADULT WHO WAS

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
INJURED IN THE SHOOTING IN THE

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
SDOOL.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
THEY USE THE WORDS INSTRUMENTAL

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
TO DESCRIBE WHAT SHE MIGHT BE

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
ABLE TO PROVIDE.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
THEY'RE PIECING TOGETHER NOW

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
WHAT HAPPENED.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
>> POLICE BELIEVE THE SHOOTER

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
CAME HERE AFTER THE MOTHER'S

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
MURDER, CARRYING WEAPONS LIKE

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
THESE.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
WHAT HAPPENED THEN?
LET'S LOOK AT THE TIME LINE

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
BASED ON POLICE REPORTS AND

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
EYEWITNESSS.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
9:30 IN THE MORNING, THAT'S WHEN

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
WE BELIEVE HE EMERGED FROM HIS

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
CAR AND HEADED INTO THE SCHOOL

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
HERE.
WE DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS HIS

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
CHARACTER BUT THEY'VE PAID AN

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
AWFUL LOT OF ATTENTION TO THIS

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
VEHICLE OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
HERE'S ALSO WHERE HE ENCOUNTERED

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
HIS FIRST PABARRICADE BECAUSE

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
THERE WAS A SECURITY SYSTEM ON

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
THE DOOR.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
PUT IN BY THE PRINCIPAL.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
POLICE LATER FOUND THAT THE

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
GLASS HERE HAD BEEN SHOT OUT OR

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
BROKEN OUT BY SOME FASHION.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
THAT SEEMS TO BE HOW HE ENTERED

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
THE SCHOOL.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
SO WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
WELL, THE FIRST CALL TO THE

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
POLICE THAT SAID THERE WAS A

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
PROBLEM CAME AT 9:36.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
THE FIRST CALL SAYING THAT THERE

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
WAS GUN FIRE INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE IN THE SCHOOL

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
KNEW IT BECAUSE THEY COULD

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
EITHER HEAR IT DIRECTLY OR

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
BECAUSE THEY HEARD IT OVER THE

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
SCHOOL'S P.A. SYSTEM.
ALL THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
IN .A VERY SMALL AREA, UP IN

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
THIS PART OF THE SCHOOL.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
SO IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
EVERYBODY ELSE HAVE SOME IDEA

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
THAT THIS WAS GOING ON, SO THAT

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
THEY COULD TRY TO BE SAFE IN

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
BEYOND THAT, WHAT HAPPENED?

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
AT 9:38, POLICE WERE SAYING

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
ALREADY THEY WERE HEARING

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
REPORTS THAT THE SHOOTING WAS

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
OVER.
AN INCREDIBLY SHORT PERIOD OF

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
TIME.
2, 2 1/2 MINUTES MAYBE WHERE THE

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
MULLING,

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
BULK IF NOT ALL OF THE SHOOTING

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
TOOK PLACE.

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
THE NEXT PHASE, 9:40, POLICE AT

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
THE SCHOOL SAID WE NEED SOME

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES HERE.

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
THAT'S THE FIRST CALL FOR

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
AMBULANCES.
IT'S FOR TWO AMBULANCES TO BEGIN

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
WITH.
AND THEN AS THEY REALIZED THEY

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
HAD MANY MORE VICTIMS IN A

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
MATTER OF MINUTES, THERE WAS A

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
CALL FOR MANY, MANY MORE

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIANS

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
AND AMBULANCES TO COME TO THE

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
SCHOOL.
AND THEN SURPRISINGLY, BY 9:50

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
IN THE MORNING, WE JUST PUT THIS

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
BECAUSE THE TIMES HAVE BEEN A

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
LITTLE BIT LOOSE, BY 9:50,

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
POLICE WERE ESSENTIALLY SAYING

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
THAT THEY HAD A SUSPECT WHO WAS

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
DOWN, MEANING ONE SUSPECT WHO

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
WAS DEAD.

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
THEY HAD SECURED THE BUILDING TO

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
SOME DEGREE.

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
THEY CLEARED THE BUILDING IS THE

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
LANGUAGE THEY USED AND A LOT OF

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THE KIDS WERE BEING LED AWAY.

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
THIS IS THE PICTURE FROM THE

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
"NEWTON BEE" OF THE KIDS BEING
LED AWAY.

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
IN ANY EVENT, THIS IS A SHORT

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
PERIOD OF TIME, 17 TO 20 MINUTES

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
THAT THIS WENT FROM NOTHING

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
HAPPENING TO ALL OF THESE EVENTS

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000

106
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
THIS SHOOTER AND HIS VICTIMS TO

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
TRY TO GET A BETTER

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
UNDERSTANDING OF PRECISELY HOW

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE THE

116
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000

BY THIS ENORMOUS TRAGEDY.

135
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
NO WORDS CAN TRULY EXPRESS HOW

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
HEART BROKEN WE ARE.

137
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
PICTURE THAT WAS JUST OBTAINED

BY CNN.
IT SHOWS ADAM LANZA, BACK IN

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000

142
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
POLICE WHO ARE TRYING TO LEARN

144

WHY THIS YOUNG MAN WOULD COMMIT

145
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
SUCH AN HORRIFIC ACT.

146
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
THEY SAY THEY HAVE FOUND VERY

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
GOOD EVIDENCE IN ADAM LANZA'S

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000

150
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
THAT INVESTIGATION.

151
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
THAT HOME IS ALSO A CRIME SCENE

152
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
NOW.
INVESTIGATORS SAY LANZA'S MOTHER

153
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
WAS KILLED IN THAT HOUSE BEFORE

154
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
THE DEADLY RAMPAGE AT THE

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000

AND THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING
OF IT.

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT, DON.

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
WE WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

161
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
MORE ABOUT ONE OF THE MORE

162
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
REMARKABLE TESTIMONIALS THAT WE

163
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
HEARD TODAY.
IT CAME FROM A MAN NAMED ROBBIE

164
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
PARKER.
AND HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT HIS

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
DAUGHTER EMILIE.

166
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
AND WHILE HE WAS EMOTIONAL AND

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
JUST ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED, THE

168
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
COMPASSION THAT HE WAS ABLE TO

169
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
SHOW WAS STUNNING.

170
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
KIM LA WAS THERE WHILE HE WAS

171
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000

173
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
KYUNG, TELL US MORE.

174
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS HE WANTED

175
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
TO SAY WAS THANK YOU.

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
ONE OF THE REASONS HE CALLED

177
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
REPORTERS TO THIS CHURCH HERE, A

178
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
CHURCH HEIFER ONLY BELONGED TO

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
FOR ATE MONTHS BECAUSE HE MOVED

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
HERE TO TAKE A JOB AT THE

181
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
HOSPITAL TO TAKE CARE OF NEWBORN

182
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
CHILDREN.

183
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
TAKING CARE OF CHILDREN THEN
HAVING TO LOSE HIS CHILD.

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
HE CALLED REPORTERS HERE.

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
HEN'T WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU

186
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAD

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
REACHED OUT TO HIS FAMILY TO SAY

188
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
WE ARE SO SORRY, WE ARE SO

189
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
HORRIFIE

190
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
HORRIFIED.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW

191
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
THIS MAN FEELS.

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
HE LOST HIS CHILD, BUT HE WANTED

193
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
TO TAKE THAT MOMENT AND THEN

194
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
EXPRESS THAT HE WANTED TO MAKE

195
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THAT

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
SOCIETY SHOULD NOT BE DEFINED BY

197
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THIS MOMENT.
HERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT HAVE

198
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
HE SAID.

199
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
>> I WAS LEAVING TO WORK AND SHE

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT AND, I'VE

201
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
ACTUALLY BEEN TEACHING HER

202
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
PORTUGUESE.

203
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
AND SO OUR LAST CONVERSATION WAS

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
IN PORTUGUESE.

205
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING AND

206
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

207
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I SAID THAT I WAS DOING WELL.

208
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME.

209
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
AND I GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
OUT THE DOOR.

211
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

212
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS WE FIND

213
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

214
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

215
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
WAS AND HOW MANY LIVES SHE WAS

216
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT TIME

217
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
HERE ON EARTH.

218
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

219
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
VERY LOVING.

220
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
MY DAUGHTER EMILIE WOULD BE ONE

221
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE STANDING

222
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
AND GIVING HER LOVE AND SUPPORT

223
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS, BECAUSE

224
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
THAT CEASE THE TYPE OF PERSON

225
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
SHA TH

226
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
THAT SHE IS.

227
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
NOT BECAUSE OF ANY PARENTING
THAT MY WIFE AND I COULD HAVE

228
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
DONE, BUT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE

229
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
GIFTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY

230
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
HER HEAVENLY FATHER.

231
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
>> Reporter: AND WHAT HE WANTED

232
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
TO SHARE IS THAT HE WANTED TO BE

233
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
LIKE HIS DAUGHTER, THAT HE WAS

234
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
NOT ANGRY, THAT HE WANTED TO

235
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
HELP OTHER PEOPLE.
HE SAYS HE NOW BELONGS TO THIS

236
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
GROUP OF PARENTS, 20 SETS OF

237
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
PARENTS WHO NOW KNOW EXACTLY HOW

238
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
IT FEELS TO LOSE YOUR CHILD IN

239
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
SUCH A HORRIBLE WAY.

240
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO MAKE SURE

241
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
THAT PARENTS AROUND THE COUNTRY

242
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
AND AROUND THE WORLD UNDERSTOOD

243
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
THAT YOU CAN NOT TAKE YOUR

244
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
CHILDREN FOR GRANTED, AND YOU

245
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
REALLY, TRULY HAVE TO CHERISH

246
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
THEM WHENEVER YOU CAN.

247
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
SOLEDAD?

248
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
>> KYUNG LAH, REPORTING THAT

249
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
STORY FOR US.

250
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
THANK YOU.
IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR HIM

251
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
TALK ABOUT HIS FAMILY'S FAITH

252
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH THAT WAS

253
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
HELPING HIS FAMILY COPE AT THIS

254
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
TIME.

255
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
AND TO ALSO SEE REPORTERS WHO

256
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
HAD SURROUNDED HIM TO, YOU KNOW,

257
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
TAKE PICTURES OR RECORD THAT

258
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
INTERVIEW, CRYING AS HE SPOKE

259
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
BECAUSE HE WAS SO EMOTIONAL.

260
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
WE WANTED TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT

261
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
MORE OF WHAT ROBBIE PARKER HAD

262
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
TO SAY, AS HE REMEMBERED HIS

263
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
DAUGHTER EMILIE IN THE MOST

264
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
HEART FELT AND TOUCHING WAYS.

265
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
LISTEN.

266
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
>> I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO OFFER

267
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO ALL

268
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
THE FAMILIES WHO ARE DIRECTLY

269
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
AFFECTED BY THIS SHOOTING.

270
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
IT'S AN HORRIFIC TRAGEDY AND WE

271
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT OUR

272
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO OUT TO

273
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
THEM.

274
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
THIS INCLUDES THE FAMILY OF THE

275
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
SHOOTER.

276
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD THIS

277
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
EXPERIENCE MUST BE FOR YOU.

278
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR

279
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
FAMILY AND OUR LOVE AND OUR

280
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
SUPPORT GOES OUT TO YOU AS WELL.

281
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
MY DAUGHTER EMILIE WOULD BE ONE

282
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE STANDING

283
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
AND GIVING HER LOVE AND SUPPORT

284
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS, BECAUSE

285
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
THAT'S THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT

286
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
SHE IS.

287
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
NOT BECAUSE OF ANY PARENTING

288
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THAT MY WIFE AND I COULD HAVE

289
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
DONE, BUT BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE

290
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
GIFTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY

291
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
HER HEAVENLY FATHER.

292
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I HAVE TWO REALLY GOOD FRIENDS

293
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
AT HOME WHO HAVE SET UP A

294
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
FACEBOOK PAGE TO HELP RAISE

295
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
MONEY FOR EMILIE.

296
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
AND WHEN I'VE GOTTEN ON THAT AND

297
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
JUST SEEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

298
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR

299
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
CONDOLENCES, IT'S BEEN QUITE

300
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
OVERWHELMING.

301
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN SETS INTO OUR

302
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
HEARTS, WE FIND COMFORT ON THE

303
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

304
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
WAS AND HOW MANY LIVES SHE WAS

305
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT TIME

306
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
HERE ON EARTH.

307
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

308
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
VERY LOVING.

309
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
EMILIE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO TRY
NEW THING, OTHER THAN FOOD.

310
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
SHE LOVED TO USE HER TALENTS TO

311
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
TOUCH THE LIVES OF EVERYONE THAT

312
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
SHE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH SHE

313
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL ARTIST, AND

314
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
SHE ALWAYS CARRIED AROUND HER

315
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
MARKERS AND PENCILS SO THAT SHE

316
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
NEVER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO
DRAW A PICTURE OF MAKE A CARD

317
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
FOR THOSE AROUND HER.

318
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF

319
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
TIMES EMILIE NOTICED SOMEONE

320
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
FEELING SAD OR FRUSTRATED AND

321
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
WOULD RUSH TO FIND A PIECE OF

322
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
PAPER TO DRAW THEM A PICTURE OR

323
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
TO WRITE THEM AN ENCOURAGING

324
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
NOTE.

325
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
EMILIE'S CARD MAKING WAS

326
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
EXPRESSED BEAUTIFULFULLY THIS

327
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
LAST OCTOBER WHEN SHE PLACED A

328
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
VERY SPECIAL CARD THAT SHE HAD

329
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
MADE INTO THE CASKET WITH HER

330
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
GRANDPA WHO ALSO JUST RECENTLY

331
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
DIED OF A TRAGIC ACCIDENT.

332
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER TWO

333
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
LITTLE SISTERS DELIGHTING IN

334
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ, DANCE

335
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS IN
LIFE.

336
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
EMILIE'S LAUGHTER WAS

337
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
INFECTIOUS, AND ALL THOSE WHO
HAD THE PLEASURE TO MEET HER

338
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
WOULD AGREE THAT THIS WORLD IS A

339
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
BETTER PLACE BECAUSE SHE HAS

340
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
BEEN IN IT.

341
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
SHE WAS THEIR BEST FRIEND.

342
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
THEY WERE ALL BORN WITHIN THREE

343
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
YEARS OF EACH OTHER, SO BY LAW

344
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE.

345
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
SHE WAS TEACHING MY MIDDLE

346
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
DAUGHTER TO READ.

347
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
SHE WOULD HELP MY YOUNGEST

348
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
DAUGHTER LEARN HOW TO MAKE

349
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
THINGS, SHOW HER HOW TO DO

350
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
CRAFTS.
THEY LOOKED UP TO HER.

351
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
AND THEY LOOKED TO HER WHEN THEY

352
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
NEEDED COMFORT.

353
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
USUALLY THAT'S SAME FOR A MOM

354
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
AND A DAD, BUT IT WAS REALLY

355
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
SWEET TO SEE A TIME WHEN ONE OF

356
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
THEM WOULD FALL OR GET THEIR

357
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
FEELINGS HURT, HOW THEY WOULD

358
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
RUN TO EMILIE TO GET SUPPORT AND

359
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
HUGS AND KISSES.

360
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO

361
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
COULD JUST LIGHT UP A ROOM.

362
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING KIND TO

363
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
SAY ABOUT ANYBODY.

364
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
AND HER LOVE AND THE STRENGTH

365
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
THAT SHE GAVE US AND THE EXAMPLE

366
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
THAT SHE SHOWED US IS

367
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
REMARKABLE.

368
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON AND

369
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER DAD.

370
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I WAS LEAVING TO WORK AND SHE

371
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT AND I'VE

372
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
ACTUALLY BEING TEACHING HER

373
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
PORTUGUESE AND SO OUR LAST

374
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
CONVERSATION WAS IN PORTUGUESE.

375
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
AND SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING AND

376
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

377
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
AND I SAID THAT I WAS DOING

378
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
WELL.
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME AND I

379
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT

380
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
THE DOOR.

381
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
FREE AGENCY IS GIVEN TO ALL OF

382
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
US TO ACT AND CHOOSE WHATEVER WE

383
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
WANT AND GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT

384
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
AWAY FROM US.
I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING HE WAS

385
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
GIVEN AND THAT'S SOMETHING HE

386
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
CHOSE TO DO WITH IT.

387
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
AND I KNOW GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT

388
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
AWAY.

389
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'M NOT MAD BECAUSE I HAVE MY

390
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
AGENCY TO MAKE SURE I USE THIS

391
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
EVENT TO DO WHAT I CAN, TO DO

392
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
WHATEVER I CAN.

393
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY

394
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
FAMILY AND MY WIFE AND MY

395
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
DAUGHTERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF AND

396
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
THAT IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I

397
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
CAN DO TO HELP ANYBODY AT

398
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, THAT I WOULD

399
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
BE WILLING TO DO THAT.

400
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT HAPPENED

401
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO SO MANY

402
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN INTO

403
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US.

404
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
BUT SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US

405
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
TO BE BETTER, TO BE MORE

406
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
COMPASSIONATE, AND MORE HUMBLE

407
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
PEOPLE.

408
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000

ONE OF 20 CHILDREN WHO WERE

411
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
KILLED INSIDE THE SCHOOL THAT

412
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000

THE ROARS WHO WERE WATCHING HIS

414
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
CRYING AS THEY HEARD WHAT HE HAD

415
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
TO SAY.

416
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
AND WHAT A SELFLESS THING TO

417
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
TALK ABOUT HOW HE WANTED TO BE

418
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
IN A POSITION TO HELP OTHER

419
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
PEOPLE EVEN WITH HIS OWN

420

DAUGHTER GONE.
LET'S GO RIGHT BACK TO DON.

421
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
>> IT IS SO HEART BREAKING.

422
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
IT'S ALMOST TOO MUCH TO TAKE.

423
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HE IS

424
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
STANDING, SOLEDAD.

425
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000

CHILDREN, ALL OF THEM EITHER 6

427

OR 7 YEARS OLD.

428
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
MOST OF THEM GIRLS.

429
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
THEY WERE SHOT DEAD IN THEIR

ATTACK ON YOUNG CHILDREN AND

ADULTS AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

CRIME SCENE THAT WAS DISCUSSED

DID PRODUCE SOME VERY -- A VERY

448
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
GOOD EVIDENCE IN THIS

449
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
INVESTIGATION.
THAT OUR INVESTIGATORS WILL BE

450
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
ABLE TO USE IN HOPEFULLY

TO HOW AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHY
THIS OCCURRED.

453

>> Reporter: POLICE WON'T SAY
WHAT THAT EVIDENCE IS, HOWEVER,

454
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN CHECKING
OUT GUN RANGES AND SPORTING GOOD

THEY FOLLOWED A LEAD THE SHOOTER

ACQUIRE GUNS RECENTLY.

461

>> FEDERAL GUNS ALSO SAID THEY

462
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
COLLECTED WEAPONS AT THE HOME.

463
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
THREE MORE GUNS WERE FOUND.

464
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
THESE THREE RIFLE MODELS, ALL

465
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
OLDER.

466
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
THEY'RE BEING TRACED.

467

AT LEAST ONE HAS BEEN CONNECTED

468
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
TO THE MOTHER.

THREE MORE WEAPONS WERE

DISCOVERED WITH THE SHOOTER IN A
CLASSROOM WHERE HE TOOK HIS OWN

THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER SAYS

477
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
THAT LONG GUN WAS USED TO KILL

478
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
SEVERAL VICTIMS.

479
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
>> I ONLY DID SEVEN OF THE

480
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
AUTOPSIES.
THE VICTIMS I HAD RANGED FROM

THREE TO 11 WOUBDS A PIECE AND I

482
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
ONLY SAW TWO OF THEM WITH

483
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
CLOSE-RANGE SHOOTING.

484
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
ALL OF THEM I KNOW WERE CAUSED

485
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
BY THE LONG WEAPON.

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
>> Reporter: ONE RELATIVE

487
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
DESCRIBES THE SHOOTER AS BEING A

488
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
VERY BRIGHT YOUNG MAN WHO AT

489
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
TIMES WAS HOME SCHOOLED BY HIS

490
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
MOTHER.

491
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL TELLS

492
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
US THAT HIS OLDER BROTHER SAYS

493
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
THAT HIS YOUNGER BROTHER WAS

494
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
AUTISTIC, BUT SO FAR NOTHING

495
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
ADDS UP TO A MOTIVE.

Capella University understands
back from rough economic times.

519
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Employees are being forced to do
more with less.

520
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And the need for capable leaders
is greater than ever.

When you see these problems do
you take a step back,

522

553
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
AND SOLEDAD, REMEMBER JUST A FEW

554
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
MONTHS AGO, THE PRESIDENT HAVING

555
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
TO MEET WITH A FAMILY OF THE

556
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
VICTIMS IN COLORADO AND NOW HE'S

557
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
HAVING TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN

558
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
HERE IN CONNECTICUT.

559
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
>> DON, WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE

560
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE

561
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
PRESIDENT'S SCHEDULE.

562
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
HE'LL MEET WITH THOSE FAMILIES

563
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
WHO LOST LOVED ONES.

564
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
THEN HE'LL MEET WITH FIRST

565
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
RESPONDERS.

566
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
BUT THEIR ACTIONS, ESPECIALLY IN
THE FACE OF WHAT THEY MUST HAVE

567
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
SEEN INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.

568
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
SO INCREDIBLY HEROIC.

569
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
THEN HE'LL CONTINUE ON WITH THIS

570
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
INTERFAITH MEETING HAPPENING

571
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
HERE.
WANT TO REMEMBER THE FIRST

572
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
VICTIM, THAT WOULD BE NANCY

573
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
LANZA.
SHE IS THE MOTHER OF THE

574
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
SHOOTER.
WE NOW KNOW SHE WAS KILLED BY

575
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
ONE OF HER OWN WEAPONS.

576
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
APPARENTLY SHE WAS A GUN

577
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
ENTHUSIAST.
BUT THERE ARE HAVE BEEN FEW

578
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
DETAILS BEYOND THAT THAT WE KNOW

579
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
OF HER.

580
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
DAVID, WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW

581
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
ABOUT THIS FIRST VICTIM?

582
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
.
>> WELL, ESSENTIALLY, THAT'S

583
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
WHAT WE CAME TO THIS AFFLUENT

584
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
NEIGHBORHOOD IN NEWTOWN TO FIND

585
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
OUT.

586
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
SORT OF THE RECURRING THEME THAT

587
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
WE SEEM TO GET IS SHE WAS JUST A

588
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
VERY PLEASANT PERSON TO BE

589
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
AROUND.
SHE WAS A BIG FAN OF GARDENING.

590
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
OFTEN LANDSCAPING IN HER

591
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
BACKYARD AND OFTEN TOOK TO A

592
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
GAME OF DICE THAT THE COMMUNITY

593
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
IN THIS AREA WOULD OFTEN HAVE A

594
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
FEW TIMES A MONTH.

595
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
REALLY DESCRIBED AS VERY MUCH A

596
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY.

597
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
THAT IMAGE OF THIS WOMAN WHO

598
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
MOVED WITH HER FAMILY IN 1998,

599
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
EVENTUALLY DIVORCING HER HUSBAND

600
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
YEARS LATER, BUT RAISED HER TWO

601
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
BOYS IN THIS VERY PICK CHTURESQ

602
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
NEW ENGLAND TOWN IS COUNTERED BY

603
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
THIS PERSON WHO COLLECTED GUNS.

604
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
IN THE ONLY GUNS, BUT A

605
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
BUSHMASTER, A VERY HIGH POWERED

606
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
WEAPON, A GLOCK, THESE ARE

607
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
WEAPONS THAT SOME CONSIDER HIGH

608
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
POWERED.
SOME ARE JUST SORT OF YOUR RUN

609
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
OF THE MILL WEAPONS, BUT

610
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
NONETHELESS, A COLLECTION OF

611
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
WEAPONS HERE THAT AT TIMES CAN

612
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
SEEM SOMEWHAT AT ODDS WITH THIS

613
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
GARDENER WHO USED TO PLAY IN

614
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
PARLOR GAMES WITH LADIES NIGHT A

615
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
FEW TIMES A MONTH WITH THIS VERY

616
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
AFFLUENT COMMUNITY HERE.

617
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
AND IT'S HARD TO GET A SENSE OF

618
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
IT NOW, BUT MANY OF THESE HOUSES

619
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
HERE, TWO AND THREE-STORY HOMES,

620
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
QUITE AN AFFLUENT COMMUNITY.

621
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
MANY PEOPLE MOVE TO THIS AREA

622
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
BECAUSE OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

623
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
THAT SEEMS TO BE SOME OF THE

624
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
RECURRING THEMES WITH THE FAMILY

625
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
MEMBERS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

626
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.

627
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
THEY FLOCK TO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

628
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
BECAUSE OF THE VALUE OF THE
SCHOOL SYSTEMS.

629
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
SO AS TRAGIC AS THIS IS, IT HITS

630
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
A SPECIAL NOTE HERE IN NEWTOWN

631
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
BECAUSE OF THE DRAW, BECAUSE OF

632
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS.

633
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
>> LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION,

634
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
DAVID.

635
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
WAS THERE ANY INDICATION -- WE

636
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
KNOW SHE WAS A GUN ENTHUSIAST --

637
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
WAS THERE ANY INDICATION THAT'S

638
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
SOMETHING SHE SHARED WITH HER

639
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
SONS.

640
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
>> I'M SORRY, I COULDN'T QUITE
HEAR THAT.

641
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
>> I WANTED TO KNOW IF SHE IN

642
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
ANY WAY SHARED HER ENTHUSIASM

643
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
FOR WEAPONS AND IN SOME CASES

644
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
HIGH POWERED WEAPONS WITH EITHER

645
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
OF HER SONS, ONE THAT WE NOW

646
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
KNOW IS THE ALLEGED SHOOTNER

647
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
THIS CASE.

648
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
>> YOU KNOW, THAT'S AN

649
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
INTERESTING QUESTION.
WE HAVE BEEN GETTING CONFLICTING

650
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
REPORTS ABOUT THAT.

651
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
WE'RE TALKING TO THE FEDERAL

652
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
AGENCIES HERE IN THE AREA.

653
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF GUN RANGES

654
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
IN THIS AREA.

655
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
WE'VE SPOKEN TO SOP OF THE

656
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
DIRECTORS AT SOME OF THOSE

657
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
PLACES.
WE DO KNOW THAT WE DO KNOW THIS

658
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
WAS AN AREA THAT HER SON HAD

659
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
SHOT AT.

660
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
BUT ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT

661
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I HAD SPOKEN TO EARLIER IN THE

662
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
DAY SAID THAT SHE DID SHOW HER

663
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
BRAND-NEW RIFLE.

664
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
FROM WHAT THIS INDIVIDUAL SAID,

665
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
SHE TOOK THEM TO TARGET

666
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
SHOOTING.

667
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
THAT'S CONTRADICTED BY WHAT SOME

668
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
OF THESE AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING

669
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
FROM THE ATF, FROM THE FBI.

670
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
SO IT'S A BIT OF A MUDDLED

671
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
PICTURE EXACTLY HOW SHE USED

672
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
THESE WEAPONS, WHETHER THEY WERE

673
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
JUST SIMPLY COLLECTOR ITEMS THAT

674
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
SAT IN HER HOUSE OR WHETHER SHE

675
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
WAS OUT THERE USING THEM ON

676
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
ABFREQUENT BASIS.

677
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
REGARDLESS, THERE WERE SIX

678
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
WEAPONS THAT POTENTIALLY COULD

679
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
HAVE BEEN USED BY THE SHOOTER.

680
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
AND UNFORTUNATELY HE DID GET HIS

681
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
HANDS ON SOME OF THEM AND MADE

682
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
USE OF THEM.

683
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
>> INCOMPLETE PORTRAIT OF NANCY

684
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
LANZA TO REPORT TO FOLKS.

685
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
THANKS FOR THAT UPDATE.

686
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
LET'S GET BACK TO DON LEMON.

687
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.

688
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
THE DEBATE OVER GUN CONTROL, AND

689
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO THE

690
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
CONSTITUTION, MOST PEOPLE THINK

691
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
THAT THEY KNOW WHAT IT SAYS, BUT

692
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
HERE'S THE ACTUAL TEXT.

693
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
WE'LL PUT IT UP.

694
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
YOU DECIDE FOR YOURSELF WHAT

695
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
RIGHT IT GUARANTEES.

696
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
A WELL REGULATED MILITIA.

697
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
THERE IT IS.

698
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
A WELL REGULATED MILITIA, BEING

699
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
NECESSARY TO THE SECURITY OF A

700
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
FREE STATE.

701
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO KEEP

702
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
AND BEAR ARMS SHALL NOT BE

703
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
INFRINGED.
YOU KNOW, THIS TRAGEDY WILL ONCE

704
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
AGAIN FUEL THE DEBATE OVER OUR

705
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS IN THIS

706
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
COUNTRY.

707
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
AND JUST HOW MUCH REGULATION

708
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
SHOULD THERE BE REGARDING THE

709
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
ACCESSIBILITY OF GUNS.

710
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I WANT TO BRING IN NOW A FORMER

711
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
POLICE OFFICER, AND HE'S NOW THE

712
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
DIRECTOR OF THE LEAD

713
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
INTELLIGENCE AND PROTECTIONS A

714
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
NEW YORK-BASED COMPANY.

715
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT REMOVING

716
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

717
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS, IT SAYS A

718
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
WELL REGULATED MILITIA, BEING

719
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
NECESSARY FOR THE SECURITY OF A

720
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
FREE STATE, THE RIGHT OF THE

721
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
PEOPLE TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS

722
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED.

723
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU CAN

724
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
GO OUT AND BUY AS MANY WEAPONS

725
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
AS POSSIBLE AND GO OUT AND BE

726
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
ABLE TO SHOOT PEOPLE.

727
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
IT'S TALKING ABOUT IF THE

728
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
GOVERNMENT BECOMES A TYRANNY, IS

729
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
THAT NOT CORRECT?

730
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
>> THAT'S PART OF THE THEORY.

731
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I MEAN, TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE

732
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
CITIZENS FREE IF THE CLIMATE OR

733
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
MENTALITY OF THE GOVERNMENT

734
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
CHANGES.

735
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
BUT THESE ARE WEAPONS BY PEOPLE

736
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
WHO ARE NOT STABLE.

737
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I SUPPORT THE SECOND AMENDMENT.

738
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE HAVING

739
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
PEOPLE ACQUIRE FIREARMS IN OUR

740
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
COUNTRY TODAY WHO ARE HAVING ME

741
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
MOTIONALLY.
THE VETTING PROCESS FOR US IN

742
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT INCLUDES

743
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL SCREENING BEFORE

744
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
THEY GIVE US A HANDGUN.

745
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
THAT SAME STANDARD DOES NOT

746
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
APPLY TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE

747
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
UNITED STATES.
WE CAN JUST WALK IN WITH A

748
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
DRIVER'S LICENSE, NOT KNOW YOU

749
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
FROM A HOLE IN THE GROUND AND IN

750
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
TWO DAYS, AS IN WISCONSIN,

751
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
ACQUIRE A HANDGUN.

752
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
THIS IS THE PROBLEM.
>> WE HAVE TO EVOLVE WITH THE

753
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
TIMES.
THIS WAS A DIFFERENT AMERICA

754
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
WHEN WE WROTE THIS AMENDMENT TO

755
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
THE CONSTITUTION.

756
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
AND I THINK WE NEED TO HID A

757
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
CHORD OF SENSIBILITY AND DECENCY

758
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO

759
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
BE PLIABLE AND COME TO

760
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
COMPROMISE.

761
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
THAT APPLIES TO BOTH EXTREMES

762
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
HERE, THE NRA, WHOSE PHILOSOPHY

763
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
IS IF YOU CAN SEE LIGHTNING AND

764
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
HEAR THUNDER YOU SHOULD GET A

765
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
GUN AND A LIBERAL WHO THINKS

766
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF 300

767
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
MILLION GUNS.

768
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
>> DURING THE COLORADO SHOOTING,

769
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
THE THEATRE MASSACRE.

770
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I WENT, IN 20 MINUTES WAS ABLE

771
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
TO BUY AN AR-15 AND ALL THE

772
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
AMMUNITION THAT WENT ALONG WITH

773
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
IT BY JUST SHOWING A DRIVER'S

774
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
LICENSE AND FEELING OUT A PAPER

775
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
WORK.

776
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
>> THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM, A

777
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
SYMPTOM OF THE PROBLEM.

778
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
AMERICANS ARE SCARED TODAY, TOO.

779
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
WHEN YOU TURN ON THE TV AND

780
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
EVERY OTHER MINUTE WE'RE

781
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
LISTENING TO SHOOTINGS IN MOVIE

782
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
THEATRES, YOU'RE WONDERING CAN

783
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
YOU BRING YOUR CHILDREN TO A

784
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
MOVIE THEATRE.

785
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
CHRISTMAS TIME YOU THINK YOUR

786
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
FAMILY AND CHILDREN ARE SAFE AT

787
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
MALLS.

788
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
SCHOOL, TEXAS A&M, VIRGINIA

789
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
TECH.
NOW IN GRAMMAR SCHOOL.

790
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WE'RE

791
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
AFFECTING THE PSYCHE OF THE

792
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
AVERAGE AMERICAN.
AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS NAY

793
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
EAR KNEE-JERK REACTING BY GOING

794
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
OUT AND ACQUIRING THIS TOOL THAT

795
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
THEY THINK IS GOING TO KEEP THEM

796
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
SAFE, WHICH IN THEORY IT WILL

797
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
WITH PROPER TRAINING, WHICH VERY

798
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
FEW PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING EXCEPT

799
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
US IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

800
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
>> AND THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT

801
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT HERE, THERE'S

802
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
TWO DIFFERENT REALITIES.

803
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
THE CULTURAL VIOLENCE FOR PEOPLE

804
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
WHO DO NOT HAVE RESPECT FOR

805
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
GUNS.

806
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE YOU

807
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
WHO GO OUT, THEY LEARN ABOUT

808
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
GUNS, THEY HANDLE THEM AND

809
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
THEY'RE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT

810
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
GUNS.
SO THE DISCONNECT HERE IS WHAT?

811
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
>> EDUCATION.

812
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
YOU SEE, WE BECOME EDUCATED IN

813
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
HOW TO HANDLE AND MANAGE THESE

814
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
THINGS.
KIND OF LIKE THIS ISSUE ABOUT

815
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
SAFEGUARDING THEM.

816
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
THIS IS THE SECOND SHOOTING IN A

817
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
WEEK THAT WE'VE HAD SOMEONE

818
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
ACQUIRE A GUN BECAUSE OF SOMEONE

819
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
FAILING TO PROPERLY SAFEGUARD
THESE WEAPONS.

820
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY

821
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
OF PEOPLE WHO OWN THE GUNS.

822
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

823
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S

824
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
IMPRESSED UPON US THE NEED TO

825
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
SAFEGUARD OUR WEAPONS AND

826
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
THERE'S A SEVERE PENALTY IF YOU

827
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
LOSE ONE.
IF YOU THINK PUTTING IT IN THE

828
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
TOP DRESSER DRAWER IN YOUR HOME

829
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
IS SAFEGUARDING IT.

830
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
WHEN SOMEONE BREAKS IN AND TAKES

831
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
IT, THE PENALTY IS EXTREME.

832
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
>> IN COLORADO, I THINK GUN

833
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
OWNERSHIP AND APPLICATIONSHAVE

834
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
GONE UP BY 40% WITHIN JUST THE

835
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
LAST YEAR OR SO?

836
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
>> GUN SALES IN GENERAL ARE

837
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
GOING THROUGH THE ROOF.
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PRESIDENT

838
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
WAS ELECTED.

839
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE DYNAMIC

840
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
THAT'S GOING ON IN AMERICA.

841
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
SOO.
>> THAT REMINDS ME OF THE THING,

842
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
HE'S COMING TO GET YOUR GUNS.

843
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
NO ONE HAS PROPOSED ANY

844
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
LEGISLATION ON ANY SAID SIDE AND

845
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
THIS PRESIDENT HAS NOT COME TO

846
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
GET ANYBODY'S GUNS.

847
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
>> I ALWAYS HEARD THIS PRESIDENT

848
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
VERY INTELLIGENTLY MAKE A REMARK

849
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
WHEN LEFS CHALLENGED ABOUT

850
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
REINSTATING THE 1994 CLINTON

851
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
ASSAULT RIFLE BAN, HE SAID THE

852
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
FOLLOWING -- WE'RE GOING TO

853
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
FOCUS ON ENFORCEMENT.
THAT'S THE KEY.

854
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM INHERENT

855
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
TO THAT, BECAUSE YOU NEED

856
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
RESOURCES TO DO THAT, DON.

857
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE PERSONNEL AND

858
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE MONEY TO

859
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
SUPPORT THAT.

860
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
AND ALL THESE THINGS WE'RE
EXPERIENCING LIKE GUN SHOWS

861
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
WHERE YOU CAN WALK IN, WALK OUT

862
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
REQUIRES AN ENFORCEMENT

863
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
MECHANISM.

864
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE MONEY AND

865
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE PERSONNEL TO

866
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
ENFORCE THAT.

867
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
IT'S A COMPLICATED PROBLEM.

868
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS TO YOU,

869
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
DON.
EVEN IF WE REINSTITUTE THE

870
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
CLINTON ASSAULT RIFLE BAN IN

871
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
1994, I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING

872
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
TO CHANGE THINGS.

873
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
THERE'S SO MUCH IGNORANCE IN THE

874
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
WAY WE DEVELOP THESE LAWS AND A

875
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
LACK OF FAMILIARITY ON HOW TO GO

876
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
TOWARD WITH IT, YOU CAN CHOKE ON

877
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
IT.

878
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
>> AND IT'S SO PLITIZED.

879
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TAKING A

880
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
LOOK AT GUN LAWS IN THIS

881
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
COUNTRY, NO ONE IS SAYING TAKE

882
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
AWAY YOUR RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

883
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
THIS IS NOT A LEFT OR RIGHT --

884
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
WELL, IT IS.
IT'S ACTUALLY A LEFT AND RIGHT

885
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
ISSUE AND IN BETWEEN.

886
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
IT'S AN INTELLIGENT ARGUMENT OR

887
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
CONVERSATION THAT WE SHOULD BE

888
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
HAVING, NOT ONE ABOUT WHICH SIDE

889
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
OF THE POLITICAL AISLE YOU'RE

890
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
ON.
>> THE THING I WILL SAY TO YOU

891
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
IS ALL I WANT STOOD IS KNOW A

892
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT YOU OTHER

893
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
THAN THE FACT THAT YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN ARRESTED.

894
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I THINK THAT'S REASONABLE.

895
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
AND I WOULD DEBATE THIS WITH THE

896
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
NRA UNTIL THE COWS CAME HOME.

897
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

898
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
FENCE, THE EXTREME LEFT LIBERAL

899
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
PEOPLE THAT THINK THEY'RE GOING

900
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
TO WAVE A MAGIC WAND AND MAKE

901
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
300 MILLION WEAPONS YOU'RE AWARE

902
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
OF GO AWAY.

903
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
>> YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE A

904
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
BLACK MARKET.

905
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
>> NEW YORK HAS THE MOST

906
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
RESTRICTIVE GUN LAWS IN THE

907
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
UNITED STATES.

908
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
WE HAVE VERY GOOD GUN LAWS.

909
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
WE NOW HAVE THE BIGGEST BLACK

910
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
MARKET FOR THEM ALSO.
THEY FILTER IN FROM GEORGIA,

911
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
VIRGINIA, ARIZONA.

912
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
YOU KNOW, WE KNOW WHERE THEY'RE

913
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
COMING FROM.
I GO BACK AND SAY WHAT I'VE SAID

914
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
BEFORE, UH YO EVE GOT TO HAVE

915
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
RESOURCES TO GO IN AND ARREST

916
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
THAT PROBLEM AND WE DON'T HAVE

917
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
IT.
>> AND THE PRESIDENT SAYS WE

THEY'VE BEEN TO HIS HOME WHERE

1044
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
HE ALLEGEDLY KILLED HIS MOTHER.

1045

1047

SOME OF THEM WERE SHOT MORE THAN

1048
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000

1049
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
POLICE FOUND THREE GUNS BESIDES

1053

THE COLUMBINE MASSACRE, 14 YEARS

1054
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
AGO, SOME ARE NOW PARENTS

1055
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
THEMSELVES.
>> YOU LOSE THE SENSE THAT

1056
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
THINGS COULD NEVER HAPPEN TO

1057
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
YOU.
SO MANY PARENTS WOULD SAY, THIS

1058
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
WOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO MY CHILD'S

1059
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
SCHOOL.

1060
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
WELL, FOR ME AS A PARENT OF A

1061
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
CHILD, I BELIEVE THIS COULD

1062
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
EASILY HAPPEN AT MY CHILD'S

1063
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
SCHOOL.

1064
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
THAT'S BECAUSE IT HAS HAPPENED

1065
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
TO ME BEFORE.

1066
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I WOULD HOPE THAT THE PEOPLE

1067
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
INVOLVED WILL WALK BESIDE THESE

1068
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES FOR

1069
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
YEARS TO COME.

1070
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
THEY HAVE YEARS AND YEARS OF

1071
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
HEALING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

1072
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
CHASING.

1073
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I HOPE WE CAN COME BESIDE THEM

1074
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
AND ENCOURAGE THEM AND FOCUS

1075
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
POSITIVELY ON THE LIVES OF THE

1076
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
ONES THAT WERE LOST.

1077
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I WANT YOU TO MEET SHAWN GRAVES.

1078
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
HE WAS SHOT SIX TIMES.

1079
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
HE ENDED UP IN A WHEELCHAIR AND

1080
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
TO THIS DAY, HE HAS PAIN BECAUSE

1081
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
OF IT.

1082
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I SPOKE WITH HIM ABOUT HOW THE

1083
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
NEWS OF CONNECTICUT WAS

1084
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
AFFECTING HIM.
>> I LIVE WITH PAIN PHYSICALLY

1085
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
ON A DAILY BASIS BECAUSE OF

1086
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
INJURIES I SUSTAINED.
BUT LOOKING BACK THEN, I TRY NOT

1087
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
TO THINK ABOUT IT.
BUT WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS

1088
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
HAPPENS, THAT'S THE FIRST THING

1089
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
YOU DO, YOU BEGIN TO RELIVE IT.

1090
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
TURNING ON THE NEWS AND JUST

1091
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
WATCHING THE COVERAGE LOIF FROM
THIS POINT OF VIEW VERSUS WHERE

1092
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I WAS THEN.

1093
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
IT WILL TAKE YOU THROUGH AN

1094
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
EMOTIONAL TOLL, THAT'S FOR SURE.

1095
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
A LOT WERE REACHING OUT TO

1096
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
FAMILIES AFTER MASS SHOOTINGS.

1097
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
AND THEY WERE JUST AMONG THE

1098

I FELT IT WAS 10 YEARS BEFORE I

TO HAVE WORKED ON.

SO THIS IS TO TRY AND FIND SOME

00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
SOME PARENTS WHO SAY THEY

1275
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
BELIEVE THAT THEIR SON'S LIFE

1276
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
MAY HAVE BEEN SAVED BECAUSE OF

1277
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
THIS YOUNG TEACHER.

1278
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
>> ROBERT AND DIANE LAKONA HAS

1279
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
TWO CHILDREN AT THAT ELEMENTARY

1280
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
SCHOOL YESTERDAY, A

1281
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
SECOND-GRADER AND THEIR SON IN

1282
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
FIRST GRADE WHO THEY SAY IT IS A

1283
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
MIRACLE HE MADE IT OUT ALIVE

1284
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
AFTER COMING FACE TO FACE WITH

1285
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
THE SHOOTER.

1286
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
>> THAT'S WHEN THEY HEARD NOISES

1287
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
THAT THEY INITIALLY THOUGHT WERE
HAMMERS FALLING.

1288
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
THEN THEY REALIZED THAT IT WAS

1289
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
GUNSHOTS.

1290
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
AND MS. SOTO, WHO WAS ADEN'S

1291
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
TEACHER, HAD THE PRESENCE OF

1292
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
MIND TO MOVE ALL THE CHILDREN TO

1293
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
A DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE FLOOR

1294
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROOM FURTHEST
AWAY FROM THE DOOR.

1295
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
THAT'S WHEN THE GUNMAN BURST IN,

1296
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
DID NOT SAY A WORD, NO FACIAL

1297
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
EXPRESSIONS, AND PROCEEDED TO

1298
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
SHOOT THEIR TEACHER.

1299
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
AND THEY BASICALLY RAN RIGHT

1300
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
NEXT TO THE GUY AND OUT THE

1301
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
DOOR.
>> THEY RAN PAST THE GUNMAN.

1302
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
>> THEY RAN PAST THE GUY.

1303
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
HE'S STILL STANDING IN THE DOOR

1304
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
AND THEY RAN PAST HIM AND RAN

1305
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
DOWN THE HALLWAY AND THEY'RE ONE

1306
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
OF THE CLOSEST ROOMS TO THE MAIN

1307
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
ENTRANCE.

1308
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
AND ADEN WAS -- HAD THE PRESENCE

1309
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
OF MIND TO HOLD THE DOOR FOR ONE

1310
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
OF HIS CLASSMATES.

1311
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE OF HIS

1312
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
CLASSMATES THAT WAS A LITTLE

1313
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
BEHIND.
WAITED FOR HIM AND THEY RAN OUT

1314
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
TO THE MAIN ROAD.

1315
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
>> WE KNOW HIS TEACHER,

1316
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
VICTORIA, SOTO, DIED IN THAT

1317
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
CLASSROOM TRYING TO PROTECT HER

1318
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
STUDENTS.
HE KNOWS HIS TEACHER WAS SHOT.

1319
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
DO YOU THINK HE KNOWS THAT SHE

1320
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
LIKELY DID NOT MAKE IT?

1321
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
>> HE KEEPS ASKING ABOUT HER.

1322
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I THINK HE'S REASSURING HIMSELF

1323
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

1324
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
HE REALLY, REALLY CARED ABOUT

1325
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
HIS TEACHER.

1326
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
HE WAS VERY CLOSE WITH HER.

1327
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
AND SHE REALLY LOVED THAT CLASS.

1328
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
AND HE KEEPS SAYING, I REALLY

1329
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
HOPE SHE'S OKAY, I HOPE IT'S NOT

1330
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
HER.

1331
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
HE KNOWS THAT SHE'S BEEN HURT

1332
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW THE END

1333
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
RESULT.

1334
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
HE KNOWS THE KIDS THAT HE SAW

1335
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
GETTING SHOT.

1336
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
HEP DOESN'T KNOW THE OUTCOME.

1337
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
SO I THINK HE'S REASSURING

1338
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
HIMSELF IN HIS 6-YEAR-OLD MIND.

1339
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I KNOW HE'S PROCESSING IT.

1340
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
BUT I THINK HE'S REASSURING

1341
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
HIMSELF.
I THINK HE'S TELLING HIMSELF

1342
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

1343
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
WE HAD TO PUT THE SIGN OUT IN

1344
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
THE FRONT TODAY ASKING PEOPLE

1345
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
NOT TO RING THE DOORBELL BECAUSE

1346
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
HE STILL HASN'T INTERNALIZED THE

1347
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
FACT THAT THIS GUNMAN, THIS BAD

1348
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
GUY IS GONE.

1349
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
AND HE WANTS TO KNOW IF THERE

1350
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
ARE MORE BAD GUYS IN THE WORLD.

1351
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER

1352
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
THAT QUESTION PROPERLY AND SO

1353
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
WHEN SOMEONE RINGS THE DOORBELL,

1354
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
HE THINKS IT'S HIM COMING TO,

1355
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
COMING FOR HIM.

1356
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
AND SO HE -- SO I THINK OUR

1357
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
BIGGEST CONCERN NOW IS MAKING

1358
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
SURE THAT WE HANDLE HIS

1359
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
SENSITIVE NATURE PROPERLY AND

1360
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
CAREFULLY AND SUPPORT HIM AND

1361
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
SUPPORT OUR DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE

1362
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
AGAIN DOES PROCESS THINGS VERY

1363
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
DIFFERENTLY THAN HE DOES.

1364
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
SO THAT'S OUR JOB AS PARENTS NOW

1365
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
IS TO STAY CLOSE TO THEM, HOLD

1366
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
THEM, HUG THEM, LOVE THEM AND

1367
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE

1368
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
SAFE.

1369
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
>> THEY DID NOT WANT THEIR

1370
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
CHILDREN TO BE PART OF THE

1371
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
INTERVIEW.

1372
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
BUT I DID SPEND TIME WITH THEM

1373
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
THIS MORNING.
AND ADEN AND HIS SISTER, THEY

1374
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
SEEMED IN HIGH SPIRITS.

1375
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
BUT CLEARLY SHAKEN.
AND AS HARD AS IT HAS BEEN FOR

1376
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
THIS FAMILY, THEY SAY THAT THEIR

1377
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
HEARTS GO OUT TO THE SO MANY

1378
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
OTHER FAMILIES WHO CANNOT GO

1379
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
HOME AND HUG THEIR CHILDREN

1380
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
TONIGHT.

1381
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
>> KATE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1382
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
THAT FAMILY OBVIOUSLY HURTING

1383
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
TONIGHT LIKE MANY OTHERS ARE.

1384
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
THE REVEREND DAVID SPENCER IS A

1385
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
CHAPLAIN AND A GRIEF COUNSELOR

1386
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
AND WENDY WALSH IS A HUMAN

1387
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
BEHAVIORAL SPECIALIST.

1388
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
THEY BOTH JOIN ME NOW.

1389
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
THANKS FOR JOINING US ON SUCH A

1390
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
REALLY HORRIFIC EVENT HERE.

1391
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
THE BOTTOM LINE, IT IS HARD TO

1392
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
THINK PAST THIS TRAGEDY.

1393
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
WIN
WENDY, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE

1394
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
TRYING TO GET PAST THIS?

1395
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
>> WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT

1396
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
NOT ONLY THOSE CHILDREN WHO

1397
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
WITNESSED THINGS AND THE

1398
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
FAMILIES WHO LOST CHILDREN WITH

1399
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
ARE TRAUMATIZED BY THIS BUT

1400
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
WE'RE ALL TRAUMATIZED BY THIS.

1401
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
IT'S SORT OF SECONDARY

1402
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER

1403
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
THAT CAN OCCUR FROM WITNESSING

1404
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
THE STORY OVER AND OVER ON

1405
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
TELEVISION.

1406
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
IT'S IMPORTANT WE CONTAIN

1407
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
OURSELVES AND OUR EMOTIONS IN

1408
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
FRONT OF OUR CHILDREN BUT STILL

1409
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
SHOW COMPASSION AND LOVE.

1410
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
LET THEM LEAD THE CONVERSATION

1411
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
SO WE TELL THEM IN SIMPLE,

1412
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
CONCRETE TERMS ABOUT WHAT

1413
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
HAPPENED.

1414
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
WE ASSURE THEM THEY ARE

1415
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
PROTECTED AND SAFE WITH US.

1416
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING, WE WATCH

1417
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
FOR KIDS -- THEY HAVE VERY

1418
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
DIFFERENT WAYS OF DEALING WITH

1419
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
TRAUMA.

1420
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
THEY MAY REGRESS.

1421
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
YOUR CHILD MAY WANT WANT IN BED

1422
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
WITH YOU AGAIN.

1423
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
YOUR CHILD MAY WET THE BED AGAIN

1424
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
LONG AFTER YOU THOUGHT IT WAS

1425
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
DEALT WITH.

1426
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO BE

1427
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
CRITICAL AND NOT OVER-PARENT BUT

1428
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
UNDERSTAND THIS IS PART OF THE

1429
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
PROCESS FOR SOME CHILDREN.

1430
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
>> AND REVEREND SPENCER, WHEN WE

1431
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
WERE GROWING UP, THE SCHOOLS,

1432
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
OUR PLACES OF WORSHIP, THEY USED

1433
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
TO BE SAFE HAVENS.

1434
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
ONE PLACE EVIL NEVER STRUCK.

1435
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
THAT HAS CHANGED.

1436
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
HOW DO YOU TELL CHILDREN AND

1437
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
PARENTS ON MONDAY THAT THEIR

1438
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
SCHOOL IS SAFE?

1439
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
>> WELL, I THINK MOST IMPORTANT

1440
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
IS THAT WE REALLY BE HONEST WITH

1441
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
YOUR CHILDREN AND WE TALK ABOUT

1442
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN EVIL

1443
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
IN THE WORLD BUT THERE'S ALSO A
GOOD.

1444
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
AND THEN CONTINUING TO REASSURE

1445
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
THEM THAT THINGS WILL BE ALL

1446
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
RIGHT AND THEN MAKE SURE THAT

1447
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
WE'RE PUTTING THINGS IN PLACE TO

1448
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW THAT

1449
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
THINGS WILL BE WELL.

1450
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
CONSTANTLY REMINDING THEM THAT

1451
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
WE'RE THERE FOR YOU AND WE'RE

1452
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
SUPPORTING YOU.

1453
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
LET THEM KNOW THE PEOPLE AT THE

1454
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
SCHOOL OR AT CHURCH ARE THERE TO

1455
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
SUPPORT YOU THROUGH THIS TIME.

1456
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
>> AND AS WE LOOK AT THESE

1457
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
PICTURES YOU'RE LOOKING AT, THIS

1458
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
IS JUST DOWN THE SQUARE FROM
WHERE I'M STANDING.

1459
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
THIS IS A MEMORIAL THAT HAS BEEN

1460
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
SET UP.

1461
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
THERE ARE 24 CANDLES THAT YOU

1462
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
SEE THERE -- 26, I SHOULD SAY,

1463
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
IN HONOR OF ALL OF THE VICTIMS

1464
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
IN THIS TRAGEDY.

1465
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
WENDY, AS WE LOOK AT THAT, WE

1466
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
HAVE BEEN HEARING A LOT ABOUT

1467
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
GUN CONTROL AND MENTAL HEALTH.

1468
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IN THIS

1469
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
PARTICULAR ISSUE?
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO SAY.

1470
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
THE GUN CONTROL DEBATE HAS BEEN

1471
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
GOING ON FOR SO LONG AND NOBODY

1472
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
CAN FIGURE OUT WHERE AND HOW TO

1473
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
DO THE REGULATION THAT THE

1474
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
SECOND AMENDMENT MENTIONS.

1475
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER WHEN YOU

1476
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
READ IT, THE WORD WELL-REGULATED

1477
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
IS IN THERE.

1478
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
BUT WE DEFINITELY NEED SOME

1479
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
MENTAL HEALTH REFORM.

1480
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
UNFORTUNATELY IN AMERICA, YOU

1481
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
ARE FREE TO BE INSANE, YOU ARE

1482
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
FREE TO NOT TAKE YOUR MEDS.

1483
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
YOU ARE FREE TO BE HOMELESS,

1484
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
EVEN.

1485
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
AND YOU ARE FREE TO KILL.

1486
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
BUT WHEN ARE WE GOING TO PUT

1487
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
COMPASSION ABOVE FREEDOM?

1488
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
AND THAT MAY MEAN GIVING

1489
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
FAMILIES AND DOCTORS MORE

1490
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
AUTHORITY THAN WE HAVE BEEN ABLE

1491
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
TO TO KEEP PEOPLE ON THEIR

1492
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
MEDICATION, SO THAT THEY CAN

1493
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
HAVE A BETTER WHEREWITHAL TO NOT

1494
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
MAKE THESE CHOICES.

1495
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF

1496
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
IT IS THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND

1497
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
THAT WHEN AN EMERGING MENTAL

1498
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
HEALTH PROBLEM -- THIS YOUNG MAN
WAS 20.

1499
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
REMEMBER THE ARIZONA SHOOTER WAS

1500
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
AROUND THE SAME AGE.

1501
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
THIS TENDS TO BE A TIME THAT IF

1502
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
YOU'RE GOING TO GET

1503
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
SCHIZOPHRENIA AS A MALE, THE

1504
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
SYMPTOMOLOGY SHOWS UP.

1505
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
WE DON'T KNOW THIS GUY'S

1506
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
DIAGNOSIS BUT I WANTED TO SAY
THAT.

1507
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
IF YOU'RE OVER 18, YOUR PARENT

1508
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
CAN'T EVEN GET YOU HELP BECAUSE

1509
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
IT'S NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY
ANYMORE.

1510
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
YOU'RE NOW A FREE ADULT.

1511
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
>> WENDY, REVEREND SPENCER,

1512
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH.

1513
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1514
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
>> A LITTLE WHILE AGO, I TOOK A

1515
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
WALK THROUGH THIS TOWN OF 27,000

1516
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
PEOPLE.

1517
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
ALL OF THEM STILL TRYING TO

1518
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
PROCESS THE HORROR OF WHAT

1519
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
HAPPENED JUST DOWN THE ROAD.

1520
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
RIGHT BEHIND ME, THAT'S THE ROAD

1521
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
THAT LEADS UP TO THE SCHOOL
WHERE THIS HAPPENED.

1522
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
IT HAS BEEN BLOCKED OFF.

1523
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
YOU CAN SEE THE SIGN HERE RIGHT

1524
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
ACROSS THE STREET ON THAT PORCH,

1525
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
IT SAYS, GOD BLESS SANDY HOOK.

1526
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
AND RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF

1527
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
THE SQUARE, 26 CANDLES FOR ALL

1528
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS TRAGEDY

1529
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
RIGHT HERE AT THE TIME SQUARE.

1530
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
AND UP THE STREET, A CHURCH

1531
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
WHERE THE VICTIMS ARE BEING

1532
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
MEMORIALIZED.

1533
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
THIS IS ONE OF THE INTIMATE

1534
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
LITTLE SQUARES HERE IN SANDY

1535
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
HOOK.

1536
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
YOU CAN SEE THE LITTLE QUAINT

1537
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
STORES, BEAUTIFUL LITTLE STORES.

1538
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
AND THEN COME THIS WAY, YOU CAN

1539
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
SEE JUST THE MEDIA.

1540
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
AND PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THIS

1541
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
SQUARE OVER.

1542
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE HERE, THEY

1543
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
SAY, THERE'S NEVER THIS MANY
PEOPLE.

1544
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
THERE ARE NEVER THIS MANY PEOPLE

1545
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
WHO COME TO THIS TOWN ON A

1546
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
SATURDAY OR SUNDAY.

1547
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
TO SEE HOW INTIMATE AND
BEAUTIFUL THIS TOWN IS, LOOK, A

1548
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
CREEK THAT RUNS RIGHT THROUGH

1549
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
IT.

1550
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
THE PEOPLE OF THIS SMALL TOWN

1551
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
PROBABLY NEVER DREAMED THAT

1552
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
THEIR TOWN WOULD BE TP FOCUS OF

1553
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
SUCH PAIN AND ANGUISH AND
SORROW.

1554
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
THIS IS THE NEWTOWN METHODIST

1555
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
CHURCH.

1556
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
THERE'S THE CHURCH BEHIND ME.

1557
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
IT'S BEEN ONE
