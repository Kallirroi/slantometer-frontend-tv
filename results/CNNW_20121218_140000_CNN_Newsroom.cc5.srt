00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
YOU LOOK AT WALMART'S

224
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000

232
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
SURPRISE.

233
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000

ON PEOPLE MAKING $1 MILLION OR

255
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000

DAN LOTHIAN IS AT THE WHITE

THIS IS GOOD, RIGHT?

261
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
>> Reporter: WELL IT'S CERTAINLY

262
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE AS YOU

263
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
POINTED OUT THE PRESIDENT FOR

264
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
QUITE SOME TIME HAD BEEN

265
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
CAMPAIGNING ON THE ISSUE SAYING

266
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
TAXES HAD TO GO UP ON HOUSE

267
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
HOLDS MAKING MORE THAN $250,000

268
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
DURING THESE NEGOTIATIONS OVER

269
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS, BOTH THE

270
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
PRESIDENT AND OTHER AIDS HERE AT

271
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
THE WHITE HOUSE HAD BEEN

272
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
INSISTING THERE WOULD BE NO DEAL

273
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
UNLESS TAXES WENT UP ON THOSE

274
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
MAKING MORE THAN 250,000 AND NOW

275
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
THE PRESIDENT ACCORDING TO

276
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
SOURCE

277
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
SOURCES LAYING OUT THE PROPOSAL

278
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
TO RAISE IT TO 400,000.

279
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
IT IS SIGNIFICANT, NOT WHAT

280
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
REPUBLICANS REALLY WANT.

281
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
THEY DON'T WANT TAXES GOING UP

282
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
ON ANYONE.
THEY WANT THE TAX BREAKS TO

283
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
CONTINUE FOR ALL AMERICANS

284
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THIS COULD

285
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

286
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
ECONOMY, COULD IMPACT THE JOB

287
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
CREATORS.
IN ADDITION THE PRESIDENT MADE

288
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
ANOTHER CONCESSION RATHER

289
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000

SPENDING CUTS.

292
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
THIS WAS SOMETHING SPEAKER JOHN

293
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
BOEHNER HAD BEEN INSISTENT UPON,

294
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
BALANCE OF NEW SPENDING CUTS AND

295
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
NEW REVENUE ALTHOUGH HOUSE GOP

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
AIDES SAY THEY HAVE TROUBLE WITH

297
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
THE MATH BUT THEY BELIEVE THIS

298
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
IS A MOVE IN THE RIGHT

299
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
DIRECTION.

300
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000

THE LAST EIGHT DAYS THEY MET

304
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000

305
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
THREE TIMES.

306
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000

WE GOT WORD OF THAT MEETING

INDICATIONS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

317
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
THE OFFER THE PRESIDENT PUT

318
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
FORWARD IS NOT THE FINAL SUFR

319
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
THERE'S ADDITIONAL ROOM FOR

320
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
COMPROMISE.

321
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000

THE KIDNAPPERS CAME ACROSS A

343
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
REBEL CHECKPOINT, SOMETHING THEY

HADN'T EXPECTED SO WE WERE IN

345
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
THE BACK OF WHAT YOU'D THINK OF

346
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
AS A MINI VAN AND AS WE WERE

347
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
DRIVING ALONG THE ROAD THE

KIDNAPPERS SAW THIS CHECKPOINT,

350
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
TWO OF THE KIDNAPPERS WERE

351
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000

JOURNALISTS?

360
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
>> WELL, ACCORDING TO RICHARD

361
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
ENGEL'S STATEMENT THIS WAS A

362
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
SHABIHA PRO-GOVERNMENT MILITIA

363
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000

364
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
GIVES YOU A SENSE OF HOW CHAOTIC

365
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
THE SITUATION HAS GOTTEN INSIDE

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
SYRIA.

367
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
WE WERE HEARING ABOUT CLASHES

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
BETWEEN RIFLE REBEL GROUPS.

369
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000

BLACKOUT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN TRY

395

403
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
CASE, TOO, WHILE NBC WAS TRYING

404
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000

405
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
TRY TO GET THEIR PEOPLE BACK.

406
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000

407
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
KIND OF MEDIA BLACKOUT WE'LL SEE

408
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000

IT'S THE SAME STRATEGY THE NRA

USED AFTER CONGRESSWOMAN

00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
6-YEAR-OLD WAS A BUNDLE OF

738
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
ENERGY, SHE IS LAID TO REST

739
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
TODAY AND 6-YEAR-OLD JESS ISICA

740
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
REKOS LIVED AND BREATHED HORSES.

741
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
SHE WAS EXPECTING A PAIR OF

742
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
COWGIRL BOOTS FOR CHRISTMAS.

743
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
YOU CAN SEE SENATOR MANCHIN IN

744
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
AN AD CALLED DEAD AIM.

745
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
IN THE AFTERMATH OF SANDY HOOK,

746
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
HE'S HAD A CHANGE OF HEART.

747
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I SPOKE WITH HIM EARLIER AND

748
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.

749
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
>> I KNOW EVERYBODY IS GRIEVING

750
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
AS HARD AS WE'RE GRIEVING IN

751
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
WEST VIRGINIA AS HARD AS I'M

752
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
GRIEVING.
I REALLY CAN'T IMAGINE.

753
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I DON'T HAVE WORDS FOR THAT, MY

754
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
SYMPATHIES FOR THEM.

755
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
WITH THAT BEING SAID WE HAVEN'T

756
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
HOPEFULLY BECOME A SOCIETY OR

757
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
BECOME EVEN A GOVERNING BODY

758
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
THAT WE CAN'T SIT DOWN AND TALK.

759
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
WE CAN'T LAY EVERYTHING ON THE

760
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
TABLE TO FIND OUT HOW DO WE MOVE

761
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
FORWARD WHEN WE KNOW WE HAVE

762
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
CHALLENGES AND YOU KNOW, I'M A

763
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
BIG PROPONENT OF COLIN POWELL'S

764
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
FIVE PROMISES TO CHILDREN.

765
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
THE SECOND PROMISE IS EVERY

766
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
CHILD SHOULD HAVE A SAFE PLACE

767
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
IN THEIR LIFE.

768
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE

769
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
HOME.

770
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
MORE THAN OFTEN IT'S THE SCHOOL

771
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S EVEN

772
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
BEEN TAKEN AWAY, SO IT IS TIME

773
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
TO SET DOWN.

774
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
IT'S TIME TO LOOK AT A

775
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
RESPONSIBLE, REASONABLE

776
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
APPROACH.
MENTAL ILLNESS, A CULTURE OF

777
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
VIOLENCE, SOMETIMES IT'S

778
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
ACCEPTED, EVEN GLORIFIED AND

779
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
THEN CERTAIN MILITARY STYLE

780
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
WEAPONS THAT REALLY AS A HUNTER

781
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
MYSELF, A PROUD DEFENDER OF THE

782
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
SECOND AMENDMENT, AS A PROUD

783
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
MEMBER OF THE NRA, WE SHOULD

784
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
QUESTION AND LOOK AND SEE IF

785
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS.

786
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
>> WOULD YOU THEN SUPPORT

787
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD BAN

788
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS?

789
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
WOULD YOU SUPPORT LEGISLATION

790
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
THAT WOULD GET RID OF

791
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES?

792
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
>> SOLEDAD, THAT ALL HAS TO COME

793
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
TO THE TABLE.

794
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
IF IT'S A POSSIBLY, REASONABLE

795
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
MANNER, I WOULD THINK THAT THE

796
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WOULD

797
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
SUPPORT A REASONABLE APPROACH TO

798
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
THAT.

799
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'VE BEEN HUNTING ALL MY LIFE.

800
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I'VE NEVER HAD MULTIPLE ROUNDS

801
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
OF CLIPS OF TEN OR MORE.

802
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
IT'S NOT NEEDED.

803
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'VE NEVER GONE WITH A

804
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
MILITARY-STYLE ASSAULT RIFLE

805
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
HUNTING.
IT'S NOT NEEDED.

806
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
SO WE NEED TO QUESTION THAT AND

807
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
WE NEED TO BRING THE NRA IN.

808
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
THESE ARE ALL GOOD PEOPLE.

809
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
THEY HAVE CHILDREN AND

810
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
GRANDCHILDREN.
THEY'RE HURTING, TOO.

811
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
THEY'RE GRIEVING.

812
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
SO YOU CAN'T VILLAINIZE, WE

813
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
WON'T MOVE FORWARD.

814
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
WE'LL BE IN A STALEMATE AGAIN

815
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DESIRE.

816
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
>> DO YOU WORRY ABOUT POLITICAL

817
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
BACKLASH?

818
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
YOU SAID YOU'RE A PROUD MEMBER

819
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
OF THE NRA AS YOU KNOW THEY

820
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
OFTEN FUND CANDIDATES AND WORK

821
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
TO OVERTHROW FRANKLY CANDIDATES

822
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
WHO DON'T SUPPORT THE SAME KINDS

823
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
OF BELIEFS AND LEGISLATION THEY

824
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
SUPPORT.

825
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
DO YOU WORRY ABOUT BACKLASH FROM

826
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
YOUR CONSTITUENTS?

827
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
>> I COME FROM THE GREAT STATE

OF WEST VIRGINIA, THE MOST

829
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
WONDERFUL PEOPLE AND WE SIT DOWN

830
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
AND COME TO CONCLUSIONS WITH THE

831
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
FACTS.

832
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR.

833
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE

834
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
MOVEMENT OR POLITICAL BACKLASH

835
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
ON ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.

836
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
THE EASIEST VOTE TO TAKE IN

837
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
WASHINGTON IS A NO VOTE.

838
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
VOTE FOR NOTHING.

839
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

840
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO MOVE

841
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
FORWARD AND FOR THE SAKE OF OUR

842
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
CHILDREN, SOLEDAD, WE HAD 20

843
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
BEAUTIFUL BABIES THAT WERE

844
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
SLAUGHTERED.

845
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
THAT CANNOT BE TOLERATED IN

846
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
AMERICA.

AT THE TABLE, CAROL, IS THE

849

FIRST STEP TO COMING TO SOME

850
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT

851
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
CHANGES TO BE HAPPENED

852
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
CONSIDERED TO BE REASONABLE ON
BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE.

853
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
>> EVEN IN THIS CLIMATE, THAT'S

854
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
EASIER SAID THAN DONE.
THANKS, SOLEDAD.

855
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
>>> NOW IS YOUR CHANCE TO TALK

856
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
ABOUT ONE OF THE BIG STORIES OF

857
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
THE DAY, THE QUESTION IS THIS.

858
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
WHAT DOES OWNING A GUN REPRESENT

859
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
TO YOU?
THERE IS ONE INDUSTRY THAT IS

860
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
RECESSION PROOF, THE GUN

861
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
INDUSTRY.

862
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
AMERICANS SPEND ABOUT $3.5

863
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
BILLION EVERY YEAR ON GUNS.

864
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
EVEN IN THE DAYS AFTER 20 FIRST

865
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
GRADERS WERE SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES

866
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
GUN STORES WERE JAMMED IN CASE

WASHINGTON DECIDES TO CLAMP DOWN

868
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
ON GUNS.

>> THEY'RE GOING TO DO

870
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
SOMETHING, THAT'S OBVIOUS, AND

871
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
PEOPLE WANT TO GET STUFF BEFORE

SCARED.

ENORMOUS APPETITE FOR GUNS IS

LARGELY FUELED BY THE NATIONAL

921
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR ON THE

922
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
MARKET.
EVERY TIME WE HEAR ABOUT A

923
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
SHOOTING, CONCERNS ARE BROUGHT

924
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
UP ABOUT THE VIOLENT VIDEO

925
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
GAMES.
SHOULD PARENTS BE WORRIED ABOUT

926
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
THE GAMES THEIR CHILDREN PLAY?

927
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I NEED YOU.

928
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I FEEL SO ALONE.

929
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
BUT YOU'RE NOT
ALONE.

930
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I KNEW YOU'D COME.

931
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
LIKE I COULD STAY AWAY.

932
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT YOU.

933
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO.

934
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE
FOR ME.

935
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
SHH!

936
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I'LL GET YOU
A RENTAL CAR.

937
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I COULD ALSO USE
AN UMBRELLA.

938
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
FALL IN LOVE WITH
PROGRESSIVE'S CLAIMS SERVICE.

939
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
>>> SINCE THE SHOOTING IN

940
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
CONNECTICUT THERE'S BEEN A MAJOR

941
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
PUSH FOR GUN CONTROL IN THIS

942
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
COUNTRY, ONE DAY THE CALIFORNIA

943
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN PLANS

944
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
TO GO AFTER SIMILAR WEAPONS WHAT

945
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
THE SHOOTER USED AT SANDY HOOK

946
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

947
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
>> I'M GOING TO DO AN ASSAULT

948
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
WEAPONS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND

949
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
IT'S GOING TO BE STRONG AND IT'S

950
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
GOING TO BE DEFINITIVE AND IT'S

951
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
GOING TO BAN BY NAME AT LEAST

952
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
100 MILITARY-STYLE SEMIAUTOMATIC

953
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS AND IT'S GOING

954
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
TO BAN BIG CLIPS, DRUMS OR

955
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
STRIPS OF MORE THAN TEN BULLETS,

956
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
AND IT'S THIS PARTICULAR

957
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
CATEGORY OF WEAPON WHICH THE

958
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
BUSHMASTER IS.

959
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
IT'S A KILLER WEAPON.

960
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
YOU CAN FIND IT VERY QUICKLY,

961
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
VERY LITTLE RECOIL, VERY LITTLE

962
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
KICK AND IT'S VERY HIGH VELOCITY

963
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
AND IT DOESN'T BELONG ON THE

964
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
STREETS OF OUR CITY AND IT

965
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
DOESN'T BELONG IN A PLACE WHERE

966
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
A 20-YEAR-OLD LIKE THIS

967
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
PARTICULAR 20-YEAR-OLD COULD GET

968
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
A HOLD OF IT AND DO WHAT HE DID.

969
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
THIS MAKES ME VERY ANGRY.

970
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
>> THERE WAS A FEDERAL ASSAULT

971
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
WEAPONS BAN, IT EXPIRED IN 2004.

972
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
>> THOSE WHO KNEW ADAM LANZA

973
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
SAID HE LOVED VIDEO GAMES.

974
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE SCHOOL'S

975
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
TECH CLUB IN HIGH SCHOOL.

976
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
MEMBERS OF THE TECH CLUB PLAYED

977
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
THE COMPUTER VIDEO GAMES

978
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
INCLUDING THE ONE YOU'RE LOOKING

979
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
AT "STARCRAFT" YOU COMMAND

980
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
ARMIES TO DEFEAT YOUR OPPONENTS.

981
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
IS THERE A LINK BETWEEN VIOLENT

982
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
VIDEO GAMES AND AGGRESSIVE

983
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
BEHAVIOR?
CRAIG ANDERSON IS A PROFESSOR AT

984
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY AND

985
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR THE

986

STUDY OF VIOLENCE AND JOINS US

987
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
FROM AMES, IOWA.

988
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
WELCOME, SIR.

989
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
>> THANK YOU, HAPPY TO BE HERE,

990
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
CAROL.

991
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
>> GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE.

992
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
IN YOUR MIND IS THERE A

993
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
CONNECTION BETWEEN VIOLENT VIDEO

994
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
GAME AND VIOLENCE IN REAL LIFE?

995
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
>> YES, THERE IS.

996
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
EVERY MAJOR SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY

997
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
THAT HAS STUDIED THE QUESTION

998
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
HAS COME TO THE SAME ANSWER, THE

999
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
MAEAMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION

1000
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL

1001
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
ASSOCIATION, THE NATIONAL

1002
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
SOCIETY FOR RESEARCH AND

1003
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
AGGRESSION HAVE COME TO THE SAME

1004
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
CONCLUSION MEDIA VIOLENCE IS A

1005
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
RISK FACTOR, IS A CAUSAL RISK

1006
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
FACTOR FOR INCREASED AGGRESSIVE

1007
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
BEHAVIOR INCLUDING VIOLENCE.

1008
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
>> YEARS AGO BACK IN THE DAY WE

1009
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
HEARD THE SAME THING ABOUT HEAVY

1010
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
METAL MUSIC OR HARD ROCK MUSIC

1011
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
WITH VIOLENT LYRICS AND THAT

1012
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
KIND OF FELL BY THE WAYSIDE AND

1013
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
NOBODY REALLY BELIEVES THAT, YOU

1014
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
KNOW, LYRICS AND MUSIC SUCH AS

1015
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
THAT TRANSLATES TO VIOLENT

1016
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
BEHAVIOR IN THE REAL WORLD.

1017
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
THAT'S TRUE.

1018
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
THE SAME THING HAS HAPPENED TO

1019
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
RESEARCH ON MOVIE VIOLENCE AND

1020
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
TELEVISION VIOLENCE AND IN A

1021
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
SENSE, THAT SPEAKS TO THE

1022
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
STRENGTH OF THE INDUSTRIES MUCH

1023
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
LIKE THE NRA, BUT THE MOVIE

1024
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
INDUSTRY VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY AND

1025
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
THEIR ABILITY TO KEEP THE

1026
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
GENERAL PUBLIC CONFUSED ABOUT

1027
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
WHAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS.

1028
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
THE RESEARCH IS VERY CLEAR.

1029
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
WE CONDUCTED, IT'S CALLED A META

1030
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
ANALYSIS TYPE OF STUDY PUBLISHED

1031
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
IN 2010 THAT LOOKED AT ALL OF

1032
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
THE VIDEO GAME STUDIES THAT WE

1033
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
COULD FIND AROUND THE WORLD,

1034
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
INCLUDING A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER

1035
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
FROM JAPAN, AND REVIEWED THOSE

1036
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
STUDIES AND COMBINED THEM USING

1037
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
STATE-OF-THE-ART STATISTICAL

1038
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
PROCEDURES AND CAME TO THE

1039
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
CONCLUSION THAT EXPOSURE TO

1040
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
VIDEO GAMES, VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES

1041
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
CAN INCREASE AGGRESSIVE

1042
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
BEHAVIOR.
>> SO PROFESSOR, WHAT EXACTLY,

1043
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
HOW DOES IT AFFECT YOUR BRAIN?

1044
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
DOES IT DESENSITIZE TO YOU

1045
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
VIOLENCE?
WHAT DOES WATCHING OR PLAYING A

1046
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
VIDEO GAME DO TO YOUR BRAIN TO

1047
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
MAKE YOU MORE VIOLENT?

1048
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
>> WELL, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

1049
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
PROCESSES GOING ON, SO IN THE

1050
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
SHORT TERM, THAT IS RIGHT WHILE

1051
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
ONE IS PLAYING THE GAME AND FOR

1052
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
A BRIEF PERIOD AFTERWARDS,

1053
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
AGGRESSIVE THOUGHTS ARE MORE

1054
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
AVAILABLE.

1055
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
IF A PROVOCATION OCCURS IN THAT

1056
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
TIME PERIOD YOU'RE MORE TO SEE

1057
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
IT AS A PROVOCATION AND

1058
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
AGGRESSIVE SOLUTIONS COME TO

1059
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
MIND.
LONGER TERM WE GET CHANGES IN

1060
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
ATTITUDES TOWARDS USING

1061
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
AGGRESSIVE SOLUTIONS, CHANGES IN

1062
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
HOW ONE INTERPRETS SAY AMBIGUOUS

1063
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
SITUATIONS, SO YOU GET BUMPED

1064
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
INTO SAY A CHILD AND N A

1065
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
LUNCHROOM.
THOSE WHO PLAY A LOT OF VIOLENT

1066
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
VIDEO GAMES ARE MORE LIKELY TO

1067
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
INTERPRET IN A BUMP AS

1068
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
INTENTIONAL AND MORE LIKELY TO

1069
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
RESPOND BY PUSHING BACK OR MAYBE

1070
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
EVEN STARTING A FIGHT.

1071
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
>> OKAY, SO THE FINAL QUESTION

1072
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
AND THIS IS THE THING I THINK

1073
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
CONFUSES PEOPLE.

1074
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PLAY GAMES

1075
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
LIKE "WORLD OF WARCRAFT"

1076
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DO AND

1077
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
MILLIONS DO NOT RESORT TO

1078
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
VIOLENT BEHAVIOR IN THE REAL

1079
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
WORLD SO HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE

1080
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
DISCONNE

1081
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
DISCONNECT.

1082
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
THE IDEA IS THAT IT'S MUCH LIKE

1083
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
SAY SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER.

1084
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
SMOKING A CIGARETTE ISN'T GOING

1085
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
TO CAUSE ALL CANCER.

1086
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
SOME WHO DON'T SMOKE CAN GET

1087
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
CANCER AND SOME WHO DO SMOKE

1088
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
DON'T GET IT.

1089
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I LIKE TO POINT OUT TAKING A

1090
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
NORMAL, HEALTHY, WELL-DEVELOPED

1091
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
CHILD OR ADOLESCENT AND YOU

1092
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
KNOW, IF THEY START PLAYING

1093
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES, THAT'S NOT

1094
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
GOING TO TURN THEM INTO A SCHOOL

1095
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
SHOOTER, MAINLY BECAUSE EXTREME

1096
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
ACTS OF VIOLENCE ALWAYS REQUIRE

1097
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
MULTIPLE RISK FACTORS TO BE

1098
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
PRESENT.

1099
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
AND MEDIA VIOLENCE IS ONLY ONE

1100
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
OF MANY RISK FACTORS OUT THERE

1101
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
FOR EXTREME KINDS OF AGGRESSION

HAD PROBLEMS SOCIALLY.

1356
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
AND WE KIND OF HAD A FEELING

1357
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

1358
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM BUT

1462
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
HE VISITED A KINDERGARTEN AND

1463
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
FIRST GRADE CLASS TO OFFER ANY

1464
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
NEEDED COMFORT AND REASSURANCE.

1465
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
>> IT IS REALLY EMOTIONAL.

1466
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
JUST GOING INTO THE CLASSROOMS

1467
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
AND LOOKING AT THOSE WONDERFUL

1468
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
CHILDREN, LOOKING AT THEIR FACES

1469
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
AND REALIZED THEY ARE BUT FOR

1470
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
THE GRACE OF GOD COULD BE OUR

1471
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
KIDS HERE.

1472
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
>> Reporter: THE SHOOTING IN

1473
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
NEWTOWN IS OPENING UP A NEW

1474
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
CONVERSATION.

1475
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
HOW MUCH SECURITY AT SCHOOLS IS

1476
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
ENOUGH?

1477
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
SHOULD THERE BE ARMED GUARDST AT

1478
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND

1479
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
PRESCHOOLS, METAL DETECTORS?

1480
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS SAY THERE

1481
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
HAS TO BE A BALANCE.

1482
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
>> WE KNOW THAT HAVING METAL

1483
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
DETECTORS AND SECURITY PEOPLE

1484
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
WITH GUNS STANDING OUT OF THE

1485
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
SCHOOL NOT ONLY WOULD MOST

1486
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
PARENTS NOT WANT TO DROP OFF

1487
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
THEIR 6-YEAR-OLD AT SCHOOL LIKE

1488
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
THAT BUT THAT DOESN'T DECREASE

1489
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
VIOLENCE AND IT CAN DECREASE THE

1490
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
PERCEIVED SENSE OF SAFETY.

1491
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
>> Reporter: SCHOOL

1492
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS SAY KIDS NEED A

1493
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
GREATER SENSE OF SECURITY THAT

1494
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
WHEN THEY GET ON THAT SCHOOL BUS

1495
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
THEY WILL RETURN HOME.

1496
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
SO SOME OF THE THINGS A SCHOOL

1497
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,000
CAN DO, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

1498
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS SAYS

1499
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
SCHOOLS SHOULD ESTABLISH A

1500
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
CRISIS RESPONSE TEAM TO DEAL

1501
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
WITH ANY EMERGENCIES.

1502
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
THEY SHOULD ALSO COMMUNICATE

1503
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
WITH PARENTS AND EXPLAIN WHAT

1504
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
KIND OF STEPS ARE BEING DONE TO

1505
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
KEEP THEIR CHILDREN SAFE AND

1506
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
REVIEW ALL POLICIES AND HAVE

1507
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
COUNSELORS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS ON

1508
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
HAND TO DEAL WITH ANY EMOTIONAL

1509
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
NEEDS THAT CHILDREN MIGHT HAVE.

1510
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
>> THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

1511
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
PEOPLE TO REVIEW ALL OF THE

1512
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
THINGS THAT THEY DO ALREADY AND

1513
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING.

1514
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
THANK YOU, LISA.

1515
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
APPRECIATE IT.

1516
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
LET'S GET RIGHT BACK TO CAROL

1517
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
COSTELLO.

1518
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
>> THANKS.

1519
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
LET'S TALK A LITTLE POLITICS

1520
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
NOW.

1521
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
WE ARE AWAITING A NEWS

1522
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
CONFERENCE FROM HOUSE SPEAKER

1523
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
JOHN BOEHNER.
WE THOUGHT THERE WAS A BRIGHT

1524
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
SPOT ON THE BRINK OF THE FISCAL

1525
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
CLIFF.
JUST WHEN WE THOUGHT THAT THE

1526
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
SPIRIT OF COMPROMISE WAS IN THE

1527
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
AIR MR. BOEHNER DECIDED TO THROW

1528
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
THE PRESS CONFERENCE THAT IS

1529
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
ABOUT TO BEGIN.

1530
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
SUPPOSEDLY MR. BOEHNER IS GOING

1531
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
TO INTRODUCE A PLAN B BECAUSE

1532
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
NEGOTIATIONS AREN'T MOVING ALONG

1533
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
FAST ENOUGH.

1534
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
LET'S HEAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE

1535
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
BECAUSE DAN LOTHIAN IS COVERING

1536
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
THE STORY, TOO.

1537
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
JUST AN HOUR AGO I TALKED TO YOU

1538
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
ABOUT THIS BRIGHT SPOT AND

1539
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
COMPROMISE IN THE AIR.

1540
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED?

1541
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
>> IT IS LIKE A SEE SAW GOING UP

1542
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
AND DOWN.
FROM SPEAKER BOEHNER'S OFFICE WE

1543
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
ARE TOLD THAT THERE IS THIS

1544
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
SENSE OF URGENCY WITH THE CLOCK

1545
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
WINDING DOWN TO THE BIG

1546
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
DEADLINE.

1547
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
THERE IS CONCERN THAT THERE

1548
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
HASN'T BEEN AN AGREEMENT.

1549
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
AND SO THE SPEAKER WANTS TO OPEN

1550
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
UP THE SECOND TRACK OR THE PLAN

1551
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
B AS YOU HAVE JUST MENTIONED.

1552
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
AND MY COLLEAGUE HEARING FROM A

1553
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
GOP SOURCE THAT THAT PLAN B

1554
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
WOULD BE SOME KIND OF

1555
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
LEGISLATION TO EXTEND THOSE BUSH

1556
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
ERA TAX CUTS FOR THOSE MAKING UP

1557
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
TO $1 MILLION.

1558
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
THAT IS THE PLAN B RIGHT NOW.

1559
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
AS FOR REACTION FROM THE WHITE

1560
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
HOUSE I DID REACH OUT TO A

1561
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
NUMBER OF FOLKS HERE I WAS SOLD

1562
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT DID SPEAK

1563
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
WITH SPEAKER BOEHNER LAST NIGHT

1564
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
BY PHONE.

1565
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
HE WAS INFORMED ABOUT THE PLAN B

1566
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
BUT WAS NOT GIVING ANY DETAILS

1567
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
ABOUT WHAT THAT PLAN B WOULD BE.

1568
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
OF COURSE, THIS COMES ON THE

1569
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
HEELS OF SOME GREAT OPTIMISM I

1570
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
THINK WHEN THE PRESIDENT

1571
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
OVERNIGHT BACKED OFF WHAT HE HAD

1572
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
HELD FOR SO LONG ON THE CAMPAIGN

1573
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
TRAIL THAT INSISTING THAT THE

1574
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
BUSH ERA TAX CUTS HAD TO EXPIRE

1575
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,000
FOR THOSE MAKING MORE THAN

1576
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
$250,000.
THE PRESIDENT NOW RAISING THAT

1577
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
UP TO $400,000.

1578
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
THAT IS VERY DRAMATIC BECAUSE

1579
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
ALL ALONG THIS WHITE HOUSE HAD

1580
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
INSISTED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO

1581
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
DEAL IF THOSE TAXES WERE

1582
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
EXTENDED FOR THOSE MAKING MORE

1583
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
THAN  $250,000.

1584
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
WE WILL AWAIT TO SEE.

1585
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT A SOURCE

1586
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
HERE SAYING THE OFFER FROM THE

1587
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
PRESIDENT WAS NOT THE FINAL

1588
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
OFFER AND THAT WAS THE OFFER

1589
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
MADE YESTERDAY.

1590
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
IT WAS A 45-MINUTE MEETING.

1591
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
INDICATIONS THAT IT IS NOT THE

1592
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
FINALAL OFFER SO SOME SENSE THAT

1593
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
THERE IS ROOM FOR COMPROMISE.

1594
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
WE ARE GETTING UP AND DOWN WHERE

1595
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
YOU GET A BIT OF OPTIMISM AND

1596
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
THEN SOMETHING ELSE GETS THROWN

1597
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
INTO THE MIX.

1598
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
>> WE ARE GOING TO GO TO A

1599
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
DIFFERENT PLACE ON CAPITOL HILL,

1600
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
SPEAK TO DANA BASH.

1601
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
JOHN BOEHNER IS BACK TO SPEAK.

1602
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY -- WHAT IS

1603
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
THIS PLAN B?

1604
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
IS THIS A STEP FORWARD OR A STEP

1605
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
BACKWARD?

1606
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
>> Reporter: I THINK IT IS A

1607
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:18,000
STEP SIDE WAYS BECAUSE HE IS

1608
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
TELLING HIS RANK AND FILE THAT

1609
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
HE IS GOING TO PREPARE THIS PLAN

1610
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
B, THIS DIFFERENT TRACK WHICH

1611
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
WILL -- I'M TOLD ACTUALLY THAT

1612
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
THEY ARE TELLING LAWMAKERS THAT

1613
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
THEY COULD HAVE THREE POTENTIAL

1614
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
LEGISLATOR WAYS TO DO THIS AND

1615
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE

1616
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
OUT THROUGHOUT THE DAY HOW TO

1617
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
PUT IT FORWARD.

1618
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
THE BIG PICTURE IS THAT THEY

1619
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WILL GET

1620
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
THE BLAME, THEY MEANING

1621
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
REPUBLICANS IF EVERYBODY'S TAXES

1622
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
GO UP ON JANUARY 1.

1623
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
THAT IS THE WAY THE POLLING

1624
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
SHOWS AND THE WAY IT IS

1625
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
POLITICLY FOR THEM.

1626
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

1627
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
LEVERAGE.

1628
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
THAT IS WHY THEY ARE POLITICLY

1629
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
PREPARING FOR THAT TO MAKE SURE

1630
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
THEY DON'T GET THE BLAME.

1631
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
ALSO, THIS IS FOR SURE A

1632
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
NEGOTIATING TACTIC.

1633
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
IT IS A WAY FOR THE SPEAKER TO

1634
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
KIND OF PUT THE PRESSURE ON THE

1635
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
PRESIDENT TO GIVE HIM MORE OF

1636
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
WHAT REPUBLICANS WANT AND MORE

1637
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
IS GREATER SPENDING CUTS AND

1638
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
FEWER TAX INCREASES.

1639
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
THAT IS THE GIST OF WHAT HE IS

1640
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
TELLING HIS PEOPLE.

1641
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I AM TOLD BY A NUMBER OF

1642
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS THAT

1643
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
SPEAKER WASN'T VERY SPECIFIC ON

1644
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000

01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
BETWEEN HIM AND THE PRESIDENT

1646
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
EXCEPT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A

1647
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
DEAL.

01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE

1654
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
GOING TO MOVE VERY FAST ON TO

1655
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000

THEY MADE US CHOOSE WHICH ONE OF

1681
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000

WHEN WE REFUSED THERE WERE MOCK

1683
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
SHOOTINGS.

1684
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
WHEN YOU WERE BLIND FOLDED AND

1685
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
TOLD AND THEN THEY FIRE THE GUN

1686
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,000
IN THE AIR IT CAN EBE VERY

1687
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE.

1688
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000

CLINTON ORDERED THE REVIEW.

CLASSIFIED BRIEFING BEFORE

1701
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000

CONNECTICUT.

1705
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
THEIR SENSE OF SECURITY HAS BEEN

1706
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
ABSOLUTELY SHATTERED FOLLOWING

1707
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
THAT AWFUL SHOOTING.

1708
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
WHAT DO YOU TELL KIDS RETURNING

1709
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
TO SCHOOL?

1710
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
HOW DO YOU MAKE THEM BELIEVE

1711
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
THEY ARE SAFE?

1712
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Wooohooo....Hahaahahaha!

1713
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Oh...there you go.

I'm gonna stand
up to her!

1716
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
No you're not.
I know.

1717
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
You know Ronny folks who save
hundreds of dollars

1718
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
switching to GEICO
sure are happy.

1719
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
How happy are they Jimmy?

1720
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Happier than a witch in
a broom factory.

1721
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Get happy. Get GEICO.

1722
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Fifteen minutes could save you
fifteen percent or more.

1723
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
OH, LET ME GUESS --OU SEE THIS?

1724
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
MORE WASHINGTON GRIDLOCK.

1725
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
NO, IT'S WORSE -- LOOK,
OUR TAXES ARE ABOUT TO GO UP.

1726
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
NOT THE TAXES ON OUR
DIVIDENDS THOUGH, RIGHT?

1727
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
THAT'S A BIG PART
OF OUR RETIREMENT.

1728
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
OH, NO,
IT'S DIVIDENDS, TOO.

1729
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
THE RATE ON OUR DIVIDENDS
WOULD MORE THAN DOUBLE.

1730
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
BUT WE DEPEND ON OUR DIVIDENDS
TO HELP PAY OUR BILLS.

1731
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
WE WORKED HARD TO SAVE.

1732
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
WELL, THE PRESIDENT
AND CONGRESS HAVE GOT

1733
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
TO WORK TOGETHER TO STOP
THIS DIVIDEND TAX HIKE.

1734
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

1738
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000

1739
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
BECAUSE ONLY National

1742
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000

THE MID-SIZE PRICE.

01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000

GO National.
GO LIKE A PRO.

1747
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
>>> ON A BALANCED APPROACH THAT

1748
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
AVERTS THE FISCAL CLIFF.

1749
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
WHAT WE HAVE OFFERED MEETS THE

1750
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
DEFINITION OF BALANCE BUT THE

1751
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
PRESIDENT IS NOT THERE YET.

1752
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
THE WHITE HOUSE OFFERED

1753
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
YESTERDAY WAS ESSENTIALLY $1.3

1754
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
TRILLION IN NEW REVENUES FOR

1755
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
ONLY $850 BILLION IN NET

1756
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
SPENDING REDUCTIONS.

1757
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
THAT'S NOT BALANCED IN MY

1758
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
OPINION.
SO AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE ARE

1759
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
GOING TO CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE

1760
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
PRESIDENT WE ARE GOING TO ALSO

1761
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
MOVE PLAN B.

1762
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT EVERY

1763
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
INCOME TAX FILER IN AMERICA IS

1764
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
GOING TO PAY HIGHER RATES COME

1765
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
JANUARY 1 UNLESS CONGRESS ACTS

1766
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
SO I BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT

1767
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
THAT WE PROTECT AS MANY AMERICAN

1768
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
TAXPAYERS AS WE CAN.

1769
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
AND OUR PLAN B WOULD PROTECT

1770
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
AMERICAN TAXPAYERS WHO MAKE $1

1771
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
MILLION OR LESS AND HAVE ALL OF

1772
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
THEIR CURRENT RATES EXTENDED.

1773
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I CONTINUE TO HAVE HOPE THAT WE

1774
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
CAN REACH A BROADER AGREEMENT

1775
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
WITH THE WHITE HOUSE THAT WOULD

1776
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
REDUCE SPENDING AS WELL AS HAVE

1777
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
REVENUES ON THE TABLE.

1778
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR

1779
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
OUR COUNTRY.

1780
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
BUT AT THIS POINT HAVING A

1781
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
BACKUP PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT AS

1782
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
FEW AMERICAN TAXPAYERS ARE

1783
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
EFFECTED BY THIS INCREASE AS

1784
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
POSSIBLE MOVING DOWN THAT PATH

1785
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
IS THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION

1786
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
FOR US.
>> GOOD MORNING.

1787
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I

1788
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
THINK ALL OF OUR HEARTS AND

1789
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
PRAYERS ARE WITH THE FAMILIES IN

1790
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1791
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
AS A FATHER I CANNOT EVEN

1792
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
IMAGINE THE UTTER HORROR THAT

1793
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
THOSE FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH

1794
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
RIGHT NOW GRIEVING THE LOSS OF

1795
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR LOVED

1796
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
ONES.

1797
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
AS FAR AS THE FISCAL CLIFF IS

1798
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
CONCERNED AS THE SPEAKER HAS

1799
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
SAID WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO

1800
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT ON

1801
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
HARD WORKING FAMILIES AND SMALL

1802
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
BUSINESSES IN THIS COUNTRY AS

1803
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
FAR AS TAX INCREASES ARE

1804
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
CONCERNED.
WE LOOK TO FIND THE ANSWER TO

1805
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
SOLVE THE PROBLEM ON THE

1806
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
SPENDING ISSUE HERE IN

1807
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
WASHINGTON.
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT YET THERE.

1808
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
HE HAS NOT COME TO WHERE HE

1809
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
NEEDS TO BE IN ORDER FOR US TO

1810
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
PUSH THROUGH A BILL THAT REALLY

1811
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
DOES BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE

1812
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
PROBLEM.
AS THE SPEAKER SAID THAT IS WHY

1813
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
WE ARE NOW DISCUSSING AN

1814
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
ALTERNATIVE PLAN IF THE

1815
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE

1816
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,000
CANNOT COME OUR WAY.

1817
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
THANK YOU.
>> WELL, AS THE SPEAKER AND THE

1818
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
LEADER SAID, WE HAVE BEEN TRYING

1819
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
TO MAKE SURE WE DO NOT GO OFF

1820
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
THIS FISCAL CLIFF.

1821
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
AT THE SAME TIME PUT AMERICA ON

1822
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
A DIFFERENT PATH, ONE FOR JOB

1823
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
CREATION AND ONE THAT TAKES CARE

1824
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
OF OUR SPENDING.

1825
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I THINK MANY TIMES THE SPEAKER

1826
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
FELT HE WAS NEGOTIATING WITH

1827
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
HIMSELF AFTER PLAN AFTER PLAN

1828
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
WHERE THE PRESIDENT STAYED

1829
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
SILENT.

1830
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
THOSE THREE WEEKS RIGHT AFTER

1831
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
THE ELECTION WHEN THE FIRST IDEA

1832
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
WAS SENT ACROSS TO THE PRESIDENT

1833
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
FROM THE SPEAKER WE HEARD

1834
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
NOTHING BUT SILENCE.

1835
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
TODAY WE WILL HAVE TO GO TO PLAN

1836
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
B.
BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE

1837
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
DO NOT GO OFF THE CLIFF AND WE

1838
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP

1839
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
AN ECONOMY WHERE JOBS CAN BE

1840
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
CREATED.
BUT THE THING WE HAVE TO

1841
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
REMEMBER IS WHERE WE ARE IN THE

1842
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
SITUATION.

1843
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
WE ARE TWO MONTHS INTO A NEW

1844
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
FISCAL YEAR.

1845
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS LOOK AT THE

1846
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
NUMBERS BECAUSE IT CAN TELL YOU

1847
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
WHERE YOU ARE.

1848
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
IN THOSE TWO MONTHS WE ARE $292

1849
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
BILLION IN DEBT.

1850
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
WHEN YOU READ THE NUMBERS THERE

1851
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
IS POSITIVE NEWS.

1852
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
REVENUES ARE UP BY 10%.

1853
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
$30 BILLION.

1854
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
THAT IS 1 BILLION LESS THAN YOU

1855
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
GET IF YOU JUST RAISE THE TOP

1856
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
TWO RATES FOR THE FIRST YEAR.

1857
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,000
BUT THE SAD REALITY IS SPENDING

1858
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
IS UP 16%, $87 BILLION.

1859
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
THAT IS WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES.

1860
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
THAT IS WHERE THE PRESIDENT HAS

1861
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
TO START TALKING ABOUT AND THAT

1862
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
IS WHAT WE WANT TO SOLVE IN THE

1863
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
LONG RUN, AN AMERICA FOR THE

1864
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
CHILDREN AND A FUTURE THAT WE

1865
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
CAN BUILD AND ONE THAT CAN

1866
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
CREATE JOBS.

1867
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
>>> THE CLOCK CONTINUES TO TICK

1868
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
AND WE ARE JUST DAYS NOW FROM

1869
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
THE END OF THE YEAR.
AND I THINK THAT THE BEST

1870
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
CHRISTMAS GIFT THAT WE CAN GIVE

1871
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
AMERICA IS AN AGREEMENT, AN

1872
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
AGREEMENT THAT GIVES CERTAINTY

1873
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
TO OUR HARD WORKING MIDDLE CLASS

1874
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
FAMILIES AS TO WHAT THEIR TAX

1875
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
RATES ARE GOING TO BE, THE SMALL

1876
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
BUSINESS OWNERS SO THEY CAN HIRE

1877
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
AND PURSUE THAT INNOVATION AND

1878
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
THAT PROVES TO THE AMERICAN

1879
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
PEOPLE THAT WE CAN LEAD AND GET

1880
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
OUR JOB DONE.

1881
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
THAT IS THE BEST CHRISTMAS GIFT

1882
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN

1883
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
GET IT DONE.

1884
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
THIS IS OUR MOMENT.

1885
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
THIS IS OUR MOMENT TO DO WHAT IS

1886
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:22,000
GOOD AND RIGHT FOR AMERICA.

1887
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
AND NOW WE ASK THE PRESIDENT TO

1888
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
JOIN US IN THAT EFFORT.

1889
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
>>> IN A NUT SHELL REPUBLICANS

1890
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
SAY JUST IN CASE THE PRESIDENT

1891
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
AND REPUBLICANS CAN'T COME TO AN

1892
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
AGREEMENT TO AVOID THE FISCAL

1893
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
CLIFF REPUBLICANS WILL INTRODUCE

1894
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
A BILL IN THE HOUSE THAT WOULD

1895
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
KEEP THOSE BUSH TAX CUTS IN

1896
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
PLACE FOR PEOPLE MAKING UP TO $1

1897
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
MILLION PER YEAR.

1898
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
SO WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE'S

1899
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
RESPONSE?

1900
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
LET'S CHECK IN WITH DAN LOTHIAN.

1901
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
ANY WORD?

1902
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
>> Reporter: WE ARE STILL

1903
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
WAITING FOR OFFICIAL RESPONSE

1904
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
BUT SOURCES CLOSE IN THE

1905
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
NEGOTIATION BELIEVE THAT THIS

1906
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
BROADER AGREEMENT IS THE WAY TO

1907
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
GO.

1908
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT WHILE

1909
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER IS PUSHING THIS

1910
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
SECOND OPTION OR THIS PLAN B HE

1911
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
STILL WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

1912
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE BROADER

1913
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
AGREEMENT.

1914
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
SO THIS IS BY NO MEANS MEANING

1915
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
THEY HAVE CUT OFF ANY FURTHER

1916
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
TALKS WITH THE WHITE HOUSE.

1917
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
THEY STILL EXPECT THAT TO
HAPPEN.

1918
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
BUT THIS IS SORT OF THE BACKUP

1919
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
PLAN BECAUSE THAT DEADLINE IS

1920
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
QUICKLY APPROACHING.

1921
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
AS FOR THE BALANCE BETWEEN

1922
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
SPENDING CUTS AND REVENUE, THIS

1923
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
IS SOMETHING THAT THE WHITE

1924
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
HOUSE BELIEVES THAT THEY HAVE

1925
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
MET.

1926
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER HAD BEEN PUSHING

1927
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
NOW FOR QUITE SOME TIME SAYING

1928
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
THAT IS A MUST AND THE WHITE

1929
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
HOUSE IN THAT NEW PROPOSAL THAT

1930
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
THE PRESIDENT PUT FORWARD

1931
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
YESTERDAY OFFERING $1.2 TRILLION

1932
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
IN SPENDING CUTS AND $1.2

1933
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
TRILLION IN NEW REVENUE.

1934
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE THE

1935
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
NUMBERS ON THIS END.

1936
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER'S OFFICE --

1937
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
>> DAN, I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT

1938
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
YOU BECAUSE HOUSE SPEAKER

1939
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
BOEHNER IS ANSWERING QUESTIONS.

1940
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
>> THE PRESIDENT IS CALLING FOR

1941
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
1$1.3 TRILLION IN REVENUE AND

1942
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
ONLY WILLING TO PUT $850 BILLION

1943
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,000
WORTH OF CUTS OVER TEN YEARS.

1944
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
>> Reporter: WHAT TYPE OF EFFECT

1945
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
HAS THE TRAGEDY IN CONNECTICUT

1946
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
HAD ON THE FISCAL CLIFF TALKS?

1947
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
IS THERE A REALIZATION THAT THE

1948
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
COUNTRY, THE LAST THING THEY

1949
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
WANT TO SEE IS A LONG DRAWN OUT

1950
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
BATTLE DURING THIS TIME?

1951
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
>> I THINK BOTH SIDES WOULD

1952
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
AGREE TO THAT.

1953
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
THIS IS A DIFFICULT TIME FOR

1954
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
AMERICANS.
THAT IS WHY WE CONTINUE TO HAVE

1955
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE WHITE

1956
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
HOUSE.
I CONTINUE TO HAVE HOPE THAT WE

1957
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
CAN REACH AN AGREEMENT.

1958
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,000
IT'S NOT A TIME TO PUT AMERICANS

1959
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
THROUGH MORE STRESS.

1960
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
>> Reporter: WHAT WOULD PLAN B

1961
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
MEAN FOR THE OTHER BIG ISSUES

1962
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
THAT WOULD CAUSE A FISCAL CLIFF?

1963
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
THE SEQUESTRATION AND THE CUTS

1964
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
THAT WOULD HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY?

1965
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS GOING

1966
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
AWAY?

1967
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
WOULD YOU INCORPORATE ANY OF

1968
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
THAT INTO THIS PLAN B

1969
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
LEGISLATION?
>> WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

1970
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
LOOK AT HOW WE WOULD ADDRESS

1971
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
THOSE ISSUES.
AS WE PUT THIS BILL TOGETHER WE

1972
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
EXPECT TO BE ON THE FLOOR LATER

1973
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
THIS WEEK.

1974
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF THE

1975
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX AND THE

1976
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
DEATH TAX COULD LIKELY BE PART

1977
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
OF THE BILL THAT WE WOULD BRING

1978
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
TO THE FLOOR.

1979
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:30,000
WE WOULD NOT DEAL WITH

1980
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
SEQUESTRATION.
>> Reporter: HOW CLOSE WOULD YOU

1981
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
SAY THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN IS?

1982
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
WILL THERE BE AN AGREEMENT?

1983
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
>> I HAVE MADE IT CLEAR TO THE

1984
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
PRESIDENT THAT I WOULD PUT $1

1985
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
TRILLION WORTH OF REVENUE ON THE

1986
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
TABLE IF YOU ARE WILLING TO PUT

1987
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
$1 TRILLION OF SPENDING

1988
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
REDUCTIONS ON THE TABLE.

1989
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
THAT AT THIS POINT WOULD BE MY

1990
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
VERSION OF A BALANCED APPROACH

1991
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
AS HE CALLED FOR.

1992
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
LAST ONE.

1993
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
>> Reporter: HOW ADAMANT ARE YOU

1994
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
THAT THE MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY

1995
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:05,000
WOULD BE A PART OF THIS?

1996
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES ON

1997
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
THE TABLE.

1998
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
THAT ISSUE HAS BEEN ON THE

1999
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
TABLE, OFF THE TABLE AND BACK ON

2000
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
THE TABLE.

2001
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
IT'S AN ISSUE FOR DISCUSSION.

2002
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS AN

2003
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE DEALT WITH

2004
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000

01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
THAT THE THINGS THAT THEY HAD IN

2186
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
PLACE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTED TO

2187
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
SAVING MORE LIVES AND PREVENTING

2188
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
GREATER LOSSES.

2189
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT

2190
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
WAYS TO DO THAT.

2191
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
PART OF THAT COMES INTO HELPING

2192
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
FEEL THAT THEY ARE NOT HELPLESS

2193
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
AND HOPELESS.

2194
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
PARENTS ARE FRUSTRATED AND ON

2195
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
EDGE AND LEADING TO CALLS ON FAR

2196
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
OUT THINGS, AN ARMED OFFICER AT

2197
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
EVERY SCHOOL.

2198
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
POLICE OFFICERS IN SCHOOLS ARE

2199
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
GOOD THINGS BUT PEOPLE ALMOST

2200
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,000
WANT A ONE TO ONE RATIO IN SOME

2201
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,000
CONVERSATIONS.
>> I CAN'T SAY THAT I BLAME

2202
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
THEM.
HOW CAN PARENTS ADDRESS THEIR

2203
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
FEARS IN MEANINGFUL WAYS?

2204
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

2205
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
AS A SCHOOL SAFETY PROFESSIONAL

2206
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
25 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE I AM

2207
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
STILL ALSO A FATHER.

2208
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
AS A FATHER I LIKE 100%

2209
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
GUARANTEE.
AS A SAFETY PROFESSIONAL I KNOW

2210
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
I CAN'T GIVE THAT SO I AM

2211
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
CERTAINLY NOT CRITICIZING THEM

2212
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
FOR THAT.

2213
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH KIDS IS

2214
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
LOOK AT THEIR PHYSICAL AND

2215
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS.

2216
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
PHYSICAL SECURITY AN ADULT

2217
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
PRESENCE PARTICULARLY THOSE

2218
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
ADULTS THAT THEY KNOW, HAVING

2219
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
PARENTS COME BACK.

2220
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PARENTS,

2221
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE FAMILIAR

2222
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
WITH.
FACES THEY KNOW AND HAVE SEEN

2223
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
FOR A LONG TIME IS IMPORTANT.

2224
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000
THOSE COMING IN FROM OUTSIDE

2225
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
HAVE CONSISTENT PHYSICAL

2226
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
IDENTIFICATION, ARM BANDS, VESTS

2227
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
AND STUFF.

2228
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
THE PHYSICAL PART IS MANAGEABLE.

2229
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
THE PART THAT IS GOING TO BE

2230
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
VERY TRICKY IS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL

2231
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
PART.
HOW ARE YOU DEALING WITH A

2232
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
NUMBER OF ISSUES ON THAT END?

2233
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
THE TRANSFER OF TRAUMA WHEN YOU

2234
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
HAVE CHILDREN GOING FROM ONE

2235
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
BUILDING TO ANOTHER AND YOU ARE

2236
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
MIXING, ARE YOU TRANSFERRING

2237
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
TRAUMA FROM ONE TO THE OTHER?

2238
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,000
HOW DO YOU MANAGE THE TURF

2239
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
ISSUES?

2240
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
YOU BRING A GROUP OF KIDS IN

2241
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
FROM SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

2242
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
SCHOOL AND HOW ARE THE RECEIVING

2243
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
KIDS GOING TO FEEL?

2244
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
ARE THEY GETTING LESS ATTENTION?

2245
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
AGE APPROPRIATE CONVERSATIONS

2246
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:59,000
WITH KIDS.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO TALK TO A

2247
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
FIVE YEAR OLD THE SAME AS AN

2248
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
EIGHT YEAR OLD.

2249
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE GRIEVE

2250
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
DIFFERENTLY.

2251
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
AND A HUGE ISSUE, CAROL, THAT WE

2252
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
OFTEN MISS SO MUCH.

2253
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
WHEN I HAVE GONE IN IN POST

2254
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
CRISIS SITUATIONS IS DOING A

2255
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
TREMENDOUS JOB OF TAKING CARE OF

2256
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
THE KIDS AND FORGET THE ADULTS.

2257
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
AND THAT PART IS CRITICAL.

2258
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
PEOPLE GRIEVE AT DIFFERENT

2259
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
TIMES.

2260
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
I TALKED PERSONALLY WITH A

2261
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
TEACHER WHO WAS IN A ROOM WHERE

2262
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
A KID ATTACKED STUDENTS WITH A

2263
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
TREE SAW AND A MACHETE AND A

2264
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER SHE

2265
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
STARTED HAVING TRAUMATIC
EXPERIENCES.

2266
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I TALKED TO A TEACHER AT A

2267
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
SCHOOL WHERE A KID BROUGHT AK-47

2268
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
TO SCHOOL AND COMMITTED SUICIDE

2269
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
AND THE TEACHER MONTHS LATER

2270
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
WOULD FREEZE AT THE DROP OF A

2271
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:49,000
BOOK.
AND THERE IS ONE OTHER ISSUE.

2272
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
DOWN THE ROAD ONE OF THE HUGE

2273
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
ISSUES THIS COMMUNITY IS GOING

2274
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH IS, DO WE

2275
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
REOPEN THAT SCHOOL?

2276
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
DO WE GO TO A NEW SCHOOL?

2277
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF ADULT

2278
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
CHALLENGES AND DISAGREEMENTS ON

2279
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
THAT.

2280
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,000
AND A WHOLE LOT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL

2281
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
DISCUSSIONS.

2282
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
HUGE ISSUES ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL

2283
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
END.

2284
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE PEOPLE

2285
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000

2286
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
DEAL OF EFFORT TO PROVIDE THAT

2287
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
SUPPORT IN LESSONS LEARNED FROM

2288
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
PAST INCIDENTS.

2289
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
IT IS SOMETHING THAT LIVES FOR

2290
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

2291
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I TALKED WITH SOMEBODY FROM A

2292
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING OVER A DECADE

2293
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
AGO AND THIS INCIDENT LAST WEEK

2294
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
OPENED UP THE WOUNDS.

2295
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
>> I CAN TOTALLY UNDERSTAND

2296
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
THAT.

2297
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
THANKS FOR YOUR INSIGHT.

NEWTOWN?
WE WILL HEAR FROM A MAN WHO HAD

2301

FEW EVECHBTS THAT HAVE REACHED

01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT HAPPENED

2329
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
HERE IN CONNECTICUT.

2330
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
ONE OF THOSE WAS THE BOMBING OF

2331
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
THE FEDERAL BUILDING IN OKLAHOMA

2332
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
CITY.
I ASKED THE GOVERNOR HOW THEY

2333
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
MANAGED TO MOVE ON.

2334
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000

2335
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
FOR THE FAMILIES AND FIRST

RESPONDERS.

2337
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,000
THE CLIMB OUT IS LONG AND

2338
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
SEARING AND VERY DIFFICULT.

2339
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
TODAY 17 YEARS AFTER THE

2340
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING WITH

2341
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
PRIVATE FUNDS WE ARE STILL

2342
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
PUTTING CHILDREN THROUGH

2343
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000

01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
PARTICULAR TO FIRST RESPONDERS,

01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
AND EVEN PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE

2347
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
FOR A NUMBER OF THE BADLY

2348

INJURED.

2349
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
THE ONE THING ABOUT NEWTOWN, IT

2350
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
IS A COMMUNITY.

2351
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
SO STITCHING TOGETHER, HOLDING

2352
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
HANDS TOGETHER, UNDERSTANDING

2353
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
YOUR NEIGHBOR IS REALLY YOUR

2354
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
NEIGHBOR IF NOT A FAMILY MEMBER.

2355
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,000
THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG TIME

2356
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
CRAWLING OUT, SCRATCHING

2357
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
YOURSELF OUT BECAUSE IT IS GOING

2358
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
TO BE SEARING.

2359
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
WE HAVE HAD SUICIDES.

2360
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
JUST A LOT OF AGONY AFTER THE

2361
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING.

2362
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
AND I AM AFRAID THAT THE TRAGEDY

2363
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
IN NEWTOWN WILL TAKE A LONG TIME

2364
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000

01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
DOWN BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO

2546
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
PUT THEM IN JAIL.

2547
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I THINK THE STATE POLICE VERY

2548
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,000
HIGH CYBER CRIME EXPERTS IN THE

2549
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,000
CASE, SENATOR BLUMENTHAL RAISED

2550
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
THEM WELL, NEED TO LOOK OFFLINE

2551
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,000
FOR MORE RELIABLE FORMS THAN

2552
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
ONLINE.
YOU WILL SEE TROLLS AND OTHERS

2553
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
USING THIS TO GET THE ATTENTION

2554
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
THAT THEY CRAVE.

2555
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,000
>> BUT POLICE CAN OFTEN FIND

2556
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
VALUABLE INFORMATION ONLINE.

2557
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
SO IN THEIR MIND THEY NEED TO

2558
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
PAY ATTENTION TO SOCIAL MEDIA

2559
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:28,000
AND THEN YOU HAVE THESE PEOPLE

2560
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,000
POSTING FAKE INFORMATION.

2561
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
>> WE NEED TO FIND RELIABLE

2562
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
SOURCES ONLINE.

2563
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
THERE ARE WAYS TO AUTHENT KATE

2564
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
THAT.
WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT A LOT

2565
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
OF PEOPLE DOING THESE PRANKS MAY

2566
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
BE COVERED BY FREE SPEECH OF THE

2567
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,000
FIRST AMENDMENT.

2568
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HOW WE
INVESTIGATE THIS.

2569
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION

2570
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
AND SOMETHING WE NEED TO MAKE

2571
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
SURE IS NEVER REPEATED.

2572
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000

2573

YOU CAN POST ANYTHING ONLINE TO

2576
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
A POINT.

2577
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
WHEN THE LIEUTENANT VANCE SAYS

2578
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
YOU ARE GOING TO BE PROSECUTED,

2579
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
WILL YOU BE?

2580
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:07,000
>> WELL, IN SOME CASES, YES.

2581
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,000
IF THERE IS A THREAT AGAINST

2582
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000

2586
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
GROUNDS FOR THAT.

2587
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
IF THEY ARE JUST POSTING

2588
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
INFORMATION THAT MAY BE

2589
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
CONFUSING THERE MAY NOT BE.

2590
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

2591
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
USE ALL OF THEIR ENERGY IN THE

2592
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,000
RIGHT WAYS AND A LOT OF BIG

2593
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,000
NETWORKS ARE VERY HELPFUL THERE

2594
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
AND THEY ARE PROTECTING THE

2595
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,000
IDENTITY OF CELEBRITIES WHO HAVE

2596
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
PEOPLE MASK RAIDING AS THEM ALL

2597
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
THE TIME.

2598
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
WHAT THEY DO IS THEY SAY THINGS

2599
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,000
AND DO THINGS THAT THEY HOPE

2600
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
WILL BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE

2601
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
CELEBRITY AND MANY OF THOSE ARE

2602
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
FAKES.
>> AS FAR AS FACEBOOK IS

2603
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
CONCERNED WHAT RESPONSIBILITY

2604
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
DOES FACEBOOK HAVE TO KICK THESE

01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000

2607
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,000
EFFORTS DO THEY TAKE?

2608
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
I THINK IT IS LESS ABOUT

2609
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,000
RESPONSIBILITY AND MORE ABOUT

2610
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,000

WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH

01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
CELEBRITIES AND VIPS THEY ARE

2613
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
VERY CAREFUL TO CREATE A UNIT SO

2614
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE VIPS

2615
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000

2618

SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE SHOOTER

2622
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
IN THIS CASE?

2623
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
>> I'M SORRY?

2624
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
ARE THEY CATCHING PEOPLE POSING

2625
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
AS THE SHOOTER?

2626
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000

even make you their best man.

01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
SCARED TO LIVE LIFE WITHOUT

2678
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000

2700
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
WHILE A BODY IN MOTION
TENDS TO STAY IN MOTION.

2701
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
STAYING ACTIVE CAN ACTUALLY
EASE ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS.

2702
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
BUT IF YOU HAVE ARTHRITIS,

2703
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
STAYING ACTIVE
CAN BE DIFFICULT.

2704
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
PRESCRIPTION CELEBREX
CAN HELP RELIEVE ARTHRITIS PAIN

2705
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
SO YOUR BODY
CAN STAY IN MOTION.

2706

BECAUSE JUST ONE
200MG CELEBREX A DAY

2707

2708

AND INFLAMMATION.

2709

PLUS, IN CLINICAL STUDIES,

2710
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,000
CELEBREX IS PROVEN TO IMPROVE
DAILY PHYSICAL FUNCTION

2711
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
SO MOVING IS EASIER.

2712
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,000
CELEBREX CAN BE TAKEN WITH
OR WITHOUT FOOD.

2713
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
AND IT'S NOT A NARCOTIC.

2714
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR
SHOULD BALANCE THE BENEFITS

2715
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,000
WITH THE RISKS.

2716
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000

2717

2718
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
HAVE THE SAME
CARDIOVASCULAR WARNING.

2719
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
THEY ALL MAY INCREASE
THE CHANCE

2720
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
OF HEART ATTACK OR STROKE,
WHICH CAN LEAD TO DEATH.

2721
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
THIS CHANCE INCREASES
IF YOU HAVE HEART DISEASE
