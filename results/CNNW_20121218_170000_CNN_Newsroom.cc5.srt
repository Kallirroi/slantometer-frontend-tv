SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR GRIEF.

97
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
IT'S ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE THE

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH TEARS IN

99
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
THEIR EYES JUST WALKING DOWN THE

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
YOU CAN'T WALK ANYWHERE NEAR I

AM WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING SOMEONE

103
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
WITH A CHILD OR TWO ADULTS

104
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
WALKING HAND IN HAND, CRYING,

105
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
BECAUSE THEY'VE JUST DROPPED OFF

106
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
FLAGS OR TEDDY BEARS OR CANDLES

107
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
OR ORIGAMI OR SOME CHRISTMAS

108
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
ORNAMENT WITH THE NAME OF A

109
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
CHILD.
WE ALL KNOW IT'S OKAY TO BE

110
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
WALKING DONE STREET CRYING.

111
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
EVERYONE SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND.

112
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL.

113
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000

COFFEE AND THE WOMAN SELLING IT

118
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
SAID IT'S FREE OF CHARGE.

119
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
SOMEONE CALLED THIS MORNING AND

120
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
SAID, THEY WANT TO PAY FOR

121
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000

THAT'S THE KIND OF THING

128
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
HAPPENING HERE.
EVERYBODY FEELS LIKE THEY'RE IN

129
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THE SAME BOAT AND IT'S A

130
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
TERRIBLE BOTH TO BE IN.

BUT TAKING IT ONE STEP FURTHER

163
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
TO FIND OUT IF THAT WAS THE

SORT OF TAKING IT TO THE NEXT

189
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
STAGE, LOOK AT DIVORCE DOCUMENT,

190
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
YOU'RE TRYING TO SEE WAS IT JUST

191
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
SOME KIND OF DIAGNOSIS OF

192
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
ASPERGERS OR SOMETHING ELSE
GOING ON.

193
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
ACCORDING TO THE DIVORCE

194
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
DOCUMENT, NANCY LANZA WAS

195
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ALL

196
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
UNREIMBURSED PSYCHIATRIC AND

197
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPENSES, ALSO SHE

198
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PICKING UP

199
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION

200
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
MEDICATIONS.
SO WHEN IT CAME TO HER SON'S

201
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
MENTAL HEALTH IT APPEARS SHE

202
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
REALLY WAS IN CHARGE OF MAKING

203
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
SURE THAT HE WAS GETTING THE

204
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
RIGHT KIND OF HELP AND

205
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
MEDICATIONS.

206
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE DIVORCE

207
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
DOCUMENH5H
HARD TO MAINSTREAM

208
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
HER SON EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T

209
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
FIT IN, THOUGH AS A FRESHMAN

210
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
HERE IN NEWTOWN, YOU KNOW, HE

211
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
WAS GIVEN A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST

212
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
AND SCHOOL SAFETY OFFICERS

213
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
WATCHED HIM CAREFULLY BECAUSE HE

214
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
WAS SO AWKWARD, SO GAWKY, OUT OF

215
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
PLACE, AND ANTI-SOCIAL THEY WERE

216
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
AFRAID THAT HE WOULD BECOME THE

217
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
VICTIM OF SOME SORT OF CRIME,

218
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
LIKE BULLYING.

219
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
IN FACT, THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

220
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
WE CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THE FACT,

221
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
ASHLEY, THAT THIS IS A KID WHO

222
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
JUST FELL OFF THE GRID.

223
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO, NO

RECORDS OF WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING

225
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
SINCE 2009 WHEN THE LAST RECORD

226
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
SHOWS THAT HE WAS TAKING CLASSES

227
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
AT A LOCAL UNIVERSITY, CLASSES

228
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
LIKE COMPUTER SCIENCE AND MACRO

229
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
ECONOMICS AND AMERICAN HISTORY.
HE'S DESCRIBED AS A GENIUS.

230
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
BUT WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE

231
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
LAST THREE YEARS, BOY, SOMETHING

232
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
WENT TERRIBLY WRONG, ASHLEIGH.

233
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000

OUT WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH HIS

MIND.
ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO MAYBE ABLE

248
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
TO OFFER SOME INSIGHT IS ALLEN

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
DOES YOUR MIND GO TO YOUR

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
YOU KNOW, HE'S A VERY BIG PART

261
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
IN THIS EVENT.

262
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT TO

263
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
THINK OF IT.

264
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000

REASON FOR IT?

266

>> YEAH.
>> Reporter: ALLEN DIAZ MAY HAVE

267
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
BEEN AS CLOSE AS ANYONE WHO

268
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000

>> VERY INTELLIGENT PERSON.

273
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
HE REALLY WAS.

274
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
IT'S LIKE THE WAY HE ACTED

275
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
AROUND OTHER PEOPLE WAS JUST

276
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
REWITHDRAWN AND REALLY QUIET.

277
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000

278
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000

HIGH SCHOOL TECH CLUB TOGETHER,
SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON

ADAM HAD HIS OWN STYLE OF

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
DRESSING.

BACKPACK LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

288
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
HE EVEN HAD A POCKET PROTECTOR

289
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
THAT HE HAD PENS IN.

290
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
>> Reporter: HE DOESN'T KNOW

291
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
WHETHER LANZA WAS BULLIED.

292
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
HE KEPT TO HIMSELF.

293
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
>> WE ALL KIND OF KNEW THAT LIKE

294
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
HE HAD PROBLEMS SOCIALLY AND WE

295
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
KIND OF HAD A FEELING THAT THERE

296
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING WRONG

297
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
WITH HIM BUT OBVIOUSLY WE NEVER

298
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
ASKED, THOUGHT IT WAS OUR PLACE

299
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
TO DO SO.

300
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000

303
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES.

304
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
ONE WAS STARCRAFT, A WAR GAMES

305
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
IN SPACE.

306
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
ANOTHER WAS WAR CRAFT 3 WHEREAS

307
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
THE AD SAYS, SURVIVAL IS A

308
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
MATTER OF STRATEGY.

309
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
>> THE BURNING SHADOW COMES TO

310
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
CONSUME US ALL.

311
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
>> WAR CRAFT 3 WAS FUN.

312
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
HE WAS REAL FLY GAMES AND HE

313
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
PICKED UP ON STAR CRAFT QUICKLY.

314
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
>> WHEN LANZA LEFT HIGH SCHOOL

315
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
AND HOME SCHOOLED, DIAZ LOST

316
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
TOUCH BUT RAN INTO LANZA'S

317
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
MOTHER NANCY ABOUT TWO YEARS

318
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
AGO.
>> I REMEMBER HER LIKE

319
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
MENTIONING THAT HE STARTED GOING

320
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
TO THE SHOOTING RANGE WITH HER.

321
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
MY INITIAL RESPONSE TO THAT WAS,

322
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I NEVER IMAGINED ADAM ONE TO

323
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
EVER EVEN HOLD A GUN.

324
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
>> Reporter: WHY DO YOU SAY

325
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
THAT?
>> I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE BECAUSE

326
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
IN MY MIND I DON'T IMAGINE SHY,

327
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
QUIET PEOPLE GOING TO A SHOOTING

328
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
RANGE.

329
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I NEVER REALLY CAN MAKE THAT

330
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
ASSOCIATION.

331
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000

BEEN TO GUN RANGES.

334
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MANY SO FAR.

335
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
THEY'VE PROVEN HE'S BEEN TO

TARGET PRACTICE SIX MONTHS AGO,

337
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000

338
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000

339
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
ONCE TOGETHER.

AND SHE WAS FRIENDS WITH THEIR

SHE WAS JUST -- I CAN'T.

347
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
IT WAS A SHOCK.

THE EVENT THAT WILL HE DID THAT

355
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
DAY MAY HAVE BEEN EVIL BUT

356
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
PRESIDENTS, YOU SAY CLEARLY WE

372
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
NEED A CHANGE IN OUR CULTURE,

373
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
THE CULTURE OF GUNS AND GUN

374
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
POLICY.
AND YOU SAY THAT IN ORDER TO

375
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
HONOR THE DEAD, YOU'VE GOT TO

376
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
HAVE SOME KIND OF ACTION.

377
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

378
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
RIGHT NOW FOR THE PRESIDENT TO

379
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
DO?

380
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
>> SEIZE THE MOMENT.

381
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
THE OPINION IN THE COUNTRY NOW

382
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
jf GUN

383
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
SAFETY.
WE HAVE HAD MAJORITIES AND TWO

384
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
POLLS, CBS, "THE WASHINGTON

385
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
POST"/ABC SAYING WE NEED

386
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
STRICTER LAWS, STRICTER EARN

387
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
FORCEMENT, AND THAT'S -- THAT'S

388
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
PRETTY BIG SHIFT.

389
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
AS YOU KNOW, OPINION HAD BEEN

390
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
SHIFTING AWAY TOWARD MORE PEOPLE

391
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
HAVING GUNS AND THE WHOLE IDEA

392
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
OF A WAY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM,

393
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
IF EVERYBODY HAS A GUN YOU CAN

394
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
STOP THE SHOOTER.

395
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
OF COURSE THAT DOUBLES DOWN ON

396
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
THE PROBLEM AND WE HAVE A

397
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
CULTURE IN WHICH GUNS ARE MORE

398
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
AVAILABLE TO YOUNG PEOPLE AND

399
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
THAT APPROACH.
>> THE PRESIDENT CAN'T DO IT

400
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
ALONE.
HE NEEDS COOPERATION OF

401
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
CONGRESS.

402
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
THREE BASIC PRINCIPLES SHOULD

403
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
GUIDE OUR GUN POLICIES.

404
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
FIRST YOU HAVE TO -- MUST HAVE A

405
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
LICENSE TO OWN A GUN.

406
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
THE LICENSE SHOULD NOT BE EASY

407
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
TO GET.

408
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
SO HOW DIFFICULT SHOULD IT BE

409
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR PARAMETERS?

410
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
>> I THINK THE PERMIT SYSTEM NOW

411
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
IS FULL OF HOLES.

412
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
IT'S DETERMINED AT THE STATE

413
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
LEVEL.
WE HAVE VERY UNEVEN LAWS.

414
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
AS YOU KNOW, SUZANNE, YOU CAN --

415
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
THE PERMIT SYSTEM AS A

416
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
BACKGROUND CHECK, A WAITING

417
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
PEER, THAT'S ALL VERY HELPFUL.

418
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
IT DONE GET INTO WHETHER YOU

419
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
KNOW HOW TO USE A GUN.

420
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
THE KINDS OF THINGS WE DO TO

421
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
LICENSE PEOPLE TO DRIVE.

422
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
CARS ARE DANGEROUS BUT WE LET

423
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
PEOPLE DRIVE AFTER THEY GET A

424
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
LICENSE, ONCE THEY PROVE TO US

425
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
THEY KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT.

426
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
THE SAME THING SHOULD BE TRUE OF

427
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
GUNS.
WE SHOULD HAVE A STRICT

428
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
LICENSURE APPROACH SO WE KNOW

429
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
WHO HAS THE GUN AND YOU CAN MAKE

430
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
ADJUSTMENTS.
WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY YOU COULD

431
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
PUT IN EFFECT A PASSWORD ON A

432
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
GUN SO SOMEONE -- IF SOMEONE

433
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
PICKS UP YOUR iPAD, THEY DON'T

434
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
KNOW YOUR PASSWORD THEY CAN'T

435
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
GET INTO YOUR iPAD THE SAME IS

436
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
TRUE OF GUNS.

437
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
IF YOU PUT A PASSWORD ON A GUN,

438
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
SOMEONE LIKE ADAM DIDN'T HAVE

439
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
THE PASSWORD HE WOULDN'T HAVE

440
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
BEEN ABLE TO USE IT.

441
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
YOU -- IF YOU LICENSE THE MOTHER

442
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
AND THEN MADE SURE THAT HE

443
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS, WE MIGHT NOT

444
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
HAVE HAD ALL OF THESE DEAD KIDS.

445
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
>> SECOND, IF YOU'RE A CIVILIAN

446
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
COW CAN'T BUY AN ASSAULT GUN.

447
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
FOLKS SAY I'M A HUNTER, I WANT

448
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
TO PROTECT MY HOME AND I WANT A

449
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000

558
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000

562

TAXPAYERS AS WE CAN.

565
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
AND OUR PLAN B WOULD PROTECT

AMERICAN TAXPAYERS WHO MAKE $1

567
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000

WE KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS,

572
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
LOOK, CAMPAIGNED ON THOSE

573
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
EARNING MORE THAN $250,000 WOULD

574
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
NOT SEE A TAX INCREASE.

575
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
NOW IT'S BEEN RAISES TO ABOUT I

576

WHERE ARE WE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS

HERE?
>> Reporter: THAT'S WHERE IT

579
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
STANDS.
I THINK IT WAS THE DRAMATIC

580
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
DEVELOPMENT OVERNIGHT WHEN THE

581
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
PRESIDENT DID SHIFT FROM

582
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
SOMETHING HE HAD BEEN PUSHING

583
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND

584
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
THE LAST FEW WEEKS SAYING

585
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
ESSENTIALLY NO DEAL COULD GET

586
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
DONE IF TAXES DID NOTTEN CREASE

587
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
ON THOSE HOUSEHOLDS MAKING MORE

588
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
THAN $250,000.

589
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
NOW THE PRESIDENT RAISING THAT

590
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
TO $400,000.

591
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I THINK THERE WAS A LEVEL OF

592
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
OPTIMISM HERE IN WASHINGTON THAT

593
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
THIS DEAL COULD GET DONE SOON.

STATEMENT A SHORT TIME AGO

604
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000

REACH A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION THAT

606
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
AVERTS THE FIRST, PROTECTS

607
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
MIDDLE CLASS, HELPS THE ECONOMY

608
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
AND PUTS OUR NATION ON A

609
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE PATH BUT

610
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT A DEAL

611
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
THAT DOESN'T ASK ENOUGH OF THE

612
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
VERY WEALTHIEST IN TAXES AND

613
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
INSTEAD SHIFTS THE BURDEN TO THE

614

MIDDLE CLASS AND SENIORS.

THE SPEAKER'S PLAN B APPROACH

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
DOESN'T MEET THIS TEST.

THE WHITE HOUSE'S POSITION

622

DEFIES COMMON SENSE.

623
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
WHAT IS CLEAR, THOUGH, THAT IS

624
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
BOTH SIDES HERE, DESPITE THE

625
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A POLITICAL

635
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
TACTIC, THE FACT HE'S GOING TO

636
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
SAY THERE'S A PLAN B?

637
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000

OUR BEST EFFORT AND BOTH SIDES

641
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
AT THE END OF THIS, WE WERE

737
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
BEING MOVED TO YET ANOTHER

738
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
LOCATION IN THE -- AROUND 11:00

739
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
LAST NIGHT LOCAL TIME, AND AS WE

740
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
WERE MOVING ALONG THE ROAD, THE

741
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
KIDNAPPERS CAME ACROSS A REBEL

742
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
CHECK POINT SOMETHING HE HADN'T

743
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
EXPECTED.
WE WERE IN THE BACK OF WHAT YOU

744
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
THINK OF AS A MINIVAN.

745
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
AS WE WERE DRIVING ALONG THE

746
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
ROAD, THE KIDNAPPERS SAW THIS

747
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
CHECKPOINT, STARTED A GUNFIGHT

748
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
WITH IT, TWO OF THE KIDNAPPERS

749
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
WERE KILLED.

750
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
WE CLIMBED OUT OF THE VEHICLE

751
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
AND THE REBELS TOOK US.

752
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
WE SPENT THE NIGHT WITH THEM.

753
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
WE DIDN'T GET MUCH SLEEP.

754
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
HOLMES.
YOU KNOW RICHARD, YOU KNOW HIM

755
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
WELL.
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S SUCH A RELIEF

756
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
TO SEE THAT HE IS OKAY.

757
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
BUT TELL US WHAT KIND OF

758
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
JOURNALIST HE IS, WHAT HE'S

759
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
EXPERIENCING BECAUSE I KNOW YOU

760
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
HAVE -- YOU'VE FACED A LOT OF

761
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
SITUATIONS SIMILAR IN IRAQ AND

762
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
AFGHANISTAN.

763
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
>> YEAH.
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

764
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
WE BUMP INTO EACH OTHER LIKE ALL

765
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
SORT OF WAR CORRESPONDENT CLUB

766
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
IF YOU LIKE, HAVE BUMPED INTO

767
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
HIM IN AFGHANISTAN, IN IRAQ ON

768
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
MULTIPLE OCCASION.

769
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
HE'S ONE OF THE GUYS SEEN AS

770
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
FEARLESS, GETS IN THERE GETS HIS

771
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
HANDS DIRTY, GETS IN AMONGST THE

772
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
WEEDS.
THIS SORT OF THING, SADLY CAN

773
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
HAPPEN.
WE'VE HAD OUR OWN PEOPLE IN

774
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
SYRIA.
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

775
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
IF YOU GET STOPPED ABOUT A

776
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
RANDOM GROUP AND KIDNAPPED.

777
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
ALL OF MY TIME IN IRAQ, 13 TIME

778
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I WAS MORE WORRIED ABOUT KIDNAP

779
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
THAN ROADSIDE BOMBS AND

780
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
FIREFIGHTS WITH THE MILITARY

781
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
BECAUSE THEY INVARIABLY DID NOT

782
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
END WELL.
THIS WAS, IN A WAY, THEY WERE

783
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
LUCKY.

784
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
IF THEY HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED BAY

785
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
HARD LINE JIHADIST GROUP THAT

786
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
MAY HAVE ENDED BADLY FOR THEM,

787
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
TOO.
THEY WERE LUCKY IN THAT THEY

788
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
WERE KEPT ALIKE, THEY HIT THE

789
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
ROADBLOCK AND DURING THAT

790
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
FIREFIGHT THEY WEREN'T SOMEHOW

791
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
HIT.

792
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
AN EXTRAORDINARY TIME OF ESCAPE,

793
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
AND LUCK.
>> TELL US ABOUT THE

794
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
PREPARATION.
WHEN YOU GO INTO A WAR ZONE, YOU

795
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
AND I BOTH HAVE TAKEN CLASSES,

796
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
FIVE DAYS OF WAR SCHOOL WHERE

797
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
THEY GAME OUT SCENARIOS.

798
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A GAME PLAN

799
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
BEFORE YOU GO IN.

800
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
>> YEAH.

801
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT TRAINING.

802
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
THAT COVERS A BUNCH OF THINGS

803
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
FROM BATTLEFIELD, MEDICAL

804
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
TREATMENT TO ARMAMENTS AND ALSO

805
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
KIDNAPPING.

806
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
AND BASICALLY TO GIVE

807
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
JOURNALISTS A FEEL, A SENSE OF

808
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE.

809
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
YOU GET A PREPARATION.

810
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
BUT NOTHING WILL PREPARE YOU FOR

811
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
THE REAL THING.

812
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
YOU CAN DO ALL OF THE PREP YOU

813
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
LIKE BUT WENT THAT HAPPENS, YOU

814
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
CAN PREPARE BUT YOU CAN'T

815
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
PREPARE.
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN

816
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING INCIDENT

817
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
THINKING THEY WERE GOING TO BE

818
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
KILLED, MOCK EXECUTIONS.

819
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
THEY ARE HAVE TO DECOMPRESS.

820
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I IMAGINE IF I WERE THEM -- WHEN

821
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
WE WERE AMBUSHED IN 2004 AND PLY

822
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
TRANSLATOR AND DRIVE WHERE

823
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
KILLED IN THE ATTACK AND

824
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
CAMERAMAN SHOT IN THE HELD, AND

825
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
THAT WAS A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE,

826
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
WE STAYED TOGETHER FOR THE NEXT

827
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
FIVE DAYS AND TALKED IT OUT

828
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
AMONGST OURSELVES.

829
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
THE WORST THEY COULD DO IS GO

830
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
HOME, SEPARATE WAYS AND ALL OF

831
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
THAT, STICK IT OUT, HAVE A CHAT,

832
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
AND DECOMPRESS.

833
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
>> HOW DID YOU GET THROUGH THAT?

834
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
>> WITH THE GUYS.

835
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
TALKING IT THROUGH WITH THEM AND

836
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
OUR SECURITY GUY WITH US THAT

837
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
DAY AND BASICALLY SAVED OUR

838
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
LIVES.
WE DEBRIEFED EXTENSIVELY.

839
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
WE MOURNED.

840
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
YOU KNOW YOU MOURN THOSE THAT

841
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
YOU LOST.

842
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
AND YOU SORT OF THEN MOVE ON.

843
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
BUT IT'S ALWAYS WITH YOU.

844
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
THE ANNIVERSARY'S JANUARY 27, I

845
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS

846
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
YESTERDAY.

847
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
HAPPENED IN 2004.

848
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
RICHARD'S SEEN A LOT OF STUFF IN

849
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
HIS CAREER.

850
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
SOMETHING DIFFERENT, AS IT WAS

851
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
WITH THE AMBUSH, CERTAINLY FOR

852
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
ME, IT WAS PERSONAL.

853
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I HAD BEEN IN A BUNCH OF

854
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
FIREFIGHT.
THESE GUYS WERE TRYING TO KILL

855
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
US, THAT'S A PERSONAL THING.

856
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
THESE GUYS WERE KIDNAPPING THEM

857
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS

858
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
HAPPENING.

859
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
IT'S DIFFERENT TO BEING AN

860
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
OBSERVER.

861
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK

862
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
THROUGH SOME OF THIS.
I'M GLAD THAT THEY'RE OKAY.

863
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
IT WAS WORRYING WHEN WE KNEW

864
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
THEY WERE MISSING.

865
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
>> WHAT GAVE YOU THE STRENGTH TO

866
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
GO BACK OUT THERE AFTER YOU

867
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
EXPERIENCED SO MUCH AND SEEING

868
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
YOUR COLLEAGUES GUNNED DOWN?

869
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
>> FOR ME PERSONALLY.

870
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
>> YES.

871
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
>> IT WAS RESPECT FOR OUR LOCAL

872
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
STAFF.

873
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE

874
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
WESTERNER WHO SOMETHING BAD

875
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
HAPPENED AND I RAN AWAY.

876
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I WAS BACK IN SIX MONTHS BECAUSE

877
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I WANTED TO GO BACK AND A SIGN

878
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
OF RESPECT AND SOLIDARITY.

879
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
THAT'S JUST FOR ME.

880
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
EVERYBODY'S DIFFERENT.

881
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
EVERYBODY DEALS WITH THESE

882
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
THINGS DIFFERENTLY, TOO.

883
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
SOME PEOPLE CAN HANDLE IT bZOwR

884
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
THAN OTHERS AND IT'S A FACTOR OF

885
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
HOW YOU'RE WIRED.

886
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
ONE'S NOT GOOD OR BAD, WHETHER

887
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
YOU CAN HAND IT OR NOT.

888
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
IT'S JUST HOW YOU'RE WIRED.

889
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I WENT BACK ANOTHER EIGHT OR

890
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
NINE TIMES BECAUSE I CARED ABOUT

891
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
THE STORY.

892
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
AND I WANTED TO GO BACK TO SEE

893
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
OUR GUYS AGAIN, RELATIVES AND

894
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
FRIENDS OF THOSE KILLED.

895
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
>> HOW DID YOUR FAMILY DEAL WITH

896
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
THAT?
THEY --
>> ANNOYED.

897
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
>> -- ANGRY TO GO BACK THERE.

898
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
>> THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I'M

899
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
DIVORCEDED.
MY DAUGHTER, AFTER THAT

900
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
INCIDENT, SHE USED TO HATE ME

901
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
GOING BACK THERE.

902
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
BUT SHE REALIZED WHAT WE DO.

903
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A PASSION

904
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
TO TELL THE STORY.

905
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
AND MANY WAYS IT'S A PRIVILEGE

906
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
TO GO SO SOME OF THE PLACES AND

907
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
TELL THE STORY, IT'S AN AN OR.

908
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
THE RISKS ARE THERE.

909
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I TELL YOUNG JOURNALISTS, IT'S

910
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
NOT FUN.

911
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
AND SHOOT-UPS AND FIREFIGHTS AND

912
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
THE RISK OF KIDNAPPING IT'S NOT

913
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
A VIDEO GAME, AND PEOPLE DIE.

914
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
AND SO IT'S NOT SOME GLORIOUS

915
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
ADVENTURE.
IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE STORY, YOU

916
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
ARE DRAWN BACK TO IT.

917
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000

CONDITION IS NOT GOOD.

931
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
BUT THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE HAS

932
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
NOT CONFIRMED THAT YET.

933
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
THE OFFICIAL LINE THAT IS HE HAS

934

950
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000

00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
ABOUT DEALING WITH THAT VERY

954
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
QUESTION AND THE QUESTION OF

955
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
EVING RAINING DOWN UPON NEWTOWN,

956

REALLY DARK DAYS.

964
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF

965
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
FAITH.

HOWARD UNIVERSITY, MAJORED IN

970
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000

YOU HAVE A BROAD LIFE

974
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
EXPERIENCE.

975
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
PEOPLE LOOK AT THIS TRAGEDY AND

976
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
THEY ASK AND WONDER, HOW DOES

977
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN?

978
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
HOW DO YOU HAVE FAITH?

979
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
HOW DOES GOD FIGURE INTO ANY OF

980
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
THIS?

981
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
>> SURE.

982
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
YOU KNOW, I MEAN FIRST THING WE

983
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
SAY, OF COURSE, IS THAT OUR

984
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
HEARTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH

985
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
THOSE WHO ARE IN THE MIDST OF

986
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
THIS TRAGIC, TRAGIC SEASON.

987
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
WE CAN'T BEGIN TO PUT ALL OF THE

988
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
WORDS NECESSARY AROUND THIS.

989
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
WE JUST SIMPLY LET PEOPLE KNOW

990
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
THAT, AS THE PRESIDENT SAID,

991
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN THIS.

992
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
WE WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR

993
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
PRAYERS AND GOODWILL ARE

994
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
FLOODING INTO YOU.

995
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
AND INTANGIBLE, WAYS.

996
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
BUT AT SAME TIME REAL FAITH

997
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
ACCOUNTS FOR HUMAN TRAGEDY AND

998
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
HUMAN LOSS AND GRIEF.

999
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
A REAL GOD CAN HELP US IN A REAL

1000
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
WORLD.
AND I THINK THAT IN SOME OF THE

1001
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
WAYS WE'VE HEARD THE

1002
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
CONVERSATION FRAMED IT DOESN'T

1003
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
REALLY ADEQUATELY GET TO THAT.

1004
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
WE BELIEVE, AT LEAST IN THE

1005
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
CHRISTIAN TRADITION, THAT GOD

1006
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
FINDS US AMIDST BRUTALITY,

1007
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
VIOLENCE.

1008
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
IS THAT RESOURCE IN THE MID OF

1009
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
THAT?

1010
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
THE FACT THAT TRAGEDY HAS

1011
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
VISITED UNITED STATES IS NOT

1012
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
EVIDENCE OF THE ABSENCE OF GOD.

1013
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I THINK, AND I'M SURE WE'LL SEE

1014
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
AS DAYS UNFOLD, THERE WILL BE

1015
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
WONDERFUL EXPRESSIONS OF GRACE

1016
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
IN THE MIDST OF TRAGEát IN

1017
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1018
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
PEOPLE FROM LOT OF DIFFERENT

1019
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
BACK GROUNDS ARE SUPPORTING ONE

1020
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
ANOTHER AND THAT'S THE BEST OF

1021
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
FAITH.
>> HOW DO YOU APPROACH PEOPLE

1022
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
WHO THINK IT'S A TIME THAT HAS

1023
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
TESTED THEY'RE FAITH AND

1024
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
CHALLENGED THEIR FAITH, AND

1025
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
MAYBE THEY ARE LOSING FAITH

1026
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
BECAUSE THEY FEEL AN

1027
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
OVERWHELMING SENSE OF GRIEF?

1028
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
>> SURE.

1029
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I WOULD SAY TO THEM, I WOULD

1030
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
LISTEN TO THEM AND I THINK THAT

1031
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
THOSE FEELINGS ARE LEGITIMATE,

1032
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
BUT I WOULD GUIDE THEM AND HELP

1033
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE BEST

1034
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
PART OF OUR TRADITION ENLARGES

1035
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
AND DEEPENS OUR FAITH IN THE

1036
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
MIDST OF THESE OCCURRENCES.

1037
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
WE TALK ABOUT THE CROSS IN

1038
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
CHRISTIANITY.
THE CROSS HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND

1039
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
GOD IS WITH US AMIDST SORRY AND

1040
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I THINK THAT AS WE GO DEEPER IN

1041
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
OUR FAITH, WE WILL FIND GRACE IN

1042
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
THE MIDST OF THIS.

1043
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
>> I WANT TO PLAY THIS CLIP.

1044
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
THIS IS THE HUSBAND OF DAWN

1045
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
HOCHSPRUNG, PRINCIPAL AT THE

1046
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
SCHOOL WHO WAS KILLED.

1047
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
>> SURE.

1048
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
>> I'M NOT ANGRY ANYMORE.

1049
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'M NOT ANGRY.

1050
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'M NOT ANGRY ANYMORE.

1051
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I'M NOT ANGRY.

1052
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'M JUST VERY SAD.

1053
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
>> HE'S NOT ANGRY ANYMORE, HE'S

1054
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
JUST VERY, VERY SAD.

1055
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
WHERE DOES THE ROLE OF

1056
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
FORGIVENESS PLAY IN THIS?

1057
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT?

1058
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
IS THAT SOMETHING'S GOING TO

1059
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
TACK A LONG TIME?
>> THIS IS THE GIT THAT FAITH

1060
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
GIVES US.

1061
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
ALLOWS US PROCESS COMPLICATED

1062
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
MOTIONS LIKE HURT AND ALLOWS US

1063
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
AND GUIDES US TOWARDS

1064
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
FORGIVENESS.

1065
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
WE DON'T FORGIVE OTHERS FOR

1066
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
THEM.

1067
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
WE USE FORGIVENESS SO WE MIGHT

1068
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
BE SET FREE.
GOD SHOWS US GOD'S GRACE TOWARDS

1069
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
US AND WE PLAY THAT BACK IN OUR

1070
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
LIVES AND WITH OUR LIVE -- IN

1071
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
OUR LIVES WITH OTHER.

1072
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
WE NEED FORGIVE BUT IT'S A

1073
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
PROCESS AND IT TAKES TIME AND

1074
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
IT'S ABOUT PRAYER AND IT'S ABOUT

1075
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
THE STUDY OF GOOD'S GOODNESS

1076
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
TOWARDS US IN THE MIDST OF OUR

1077
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
OWN ABSENCE OF GRACE TOWARDS

1078
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
OTHERS WE FIND THAT WE'VE BEEN

1079
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
FORGIVEN.
0 WE MIR THAT BACK IN THE WORLD.

1080
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
THIS IS A PROCESS.

1081
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
AND I WOULD SAY THAT ONE OF THE

1082
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
THINGS THAT WE'VE GOT TO DO,

1083
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
WE'VE GOT TO FORGIVE ADAM LANZA.

1084
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
WE GOT FIND IT WITHIN OUR HEARTS

1085
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
TO FORGIVE HIM.

1086
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
HE WAS A BROKEN YOUNG MAN FROM

1087
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
WHAT WE CAN TELL RIGHT NOW.

1088
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
AND WE HAVE GOT TO FIND IT

1089
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
WITHIN THE BEST OF OUR FAITH

1090
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
TRADITION TO FORGIVE HIM AND

1091
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
MOVE FORWARD.

1092
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
>> FOR THOSE WHO DON'T BELIEVE

1093
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
IN THE FAITH, THEY DON'T BELIEVE

1094
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
IN HEAVEN OR BELIEVE THERE'S A

1095
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
BETTER PLACE FOR A 6-YEAR-OLD TO

1096
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
BE EXCEPT IN THEIR ARMS, WHAT DO

1097
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
YOU SAY TO THOSE FOLKS WHO DON'T

1098
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
BELIEVE IN GOD OR HAVE THAT

1099
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
FAITH?
>> I THINK THAT WE CAN GO SO FAR

1100
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
AND JUST IN OUR CAPACITY TO LOVE

1101
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
AND TO BE WITH ONE ANOTHER.

1102
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
WE CAN GO SO FAR.

1103
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
BY I THINK WHEN WE GET INTO

1104
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
PROCESSING COMPLEX EMOTIONS LEAK

1105
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
THE NEED FOR FORGIVENESS, WE

1106
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
LACK THE STRENGTH TO TAKES US

1107
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
THE FULL WAY OF OURSELVES, THIS

1108
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
IS WHERE FAITH IS A RESOURCE TO

1109
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
US.

1110
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
IT MOVES US BEYOND OURSELVES.

1111
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
IT ENLARGES OUR HEARTS.

1112
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
IT STIRS UP RESERVOIRS OF

1113
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
COMPASSION IN US.
AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY.

1114
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
WE NEED TO DRAW DOWN ON THAT.

1115
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
>> ALL RIGHT.

1116
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000

THE NEWTOWN DISTRICT TODAY.

1164
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
IT IS NOT NORMALLY LIKE THIS.

1165
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
THE TRAFFIC IS COMPRISED OF

1166
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
PEOPLE FROM SURROUNDING

1167
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000

COME INTO TOWN, RIGHT AWAY ON

1174
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000

TEARS AS THEY DROP OFF WHAT THEY

00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
BROUGHT.

1185
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THE TRAFFIC

1186
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
WITH PEOPLE FROM SURROUNDING

1187
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
COMMUNITIES.
NEXT THING YOU NOTICE IS THIS.

1188
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
ALL OF THE MEDIA.

PEOPLE HAVE COME FROM ALL OVER

1190
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
THE WORLD TO COVER THIS STORY

1191
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
AND THEY ARE SET UP RIGHT IN THE

1192
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
TOWN SQUARE.

1193
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF TOWN.

1194
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
A PLACE THAT IS NOT USED TO

1195
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
SEEING SATELLITE TRUCKS AND THIS

1196
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
KIND OF MEDIA ATTENTION.

1197
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
BOY, ARE THEY GETTING USED TO IT

1198
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
NOW.
ANOTHER THING THAT YOU'LL FIND

1199
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
AMIDST ALL OF THE TRAFFIC, TAKE

1200
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
A LOOK UP HERE.

1201
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
POLICE AND ORANGE CONES AND ROAD

1202
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
CLOSED SIGNS, THAT IS THE ROAD

1203
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
THAT LEADS UP TO THE SANDY HOOK

1204
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1205
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY LIMITING MOST

1206
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
OF THE TRAFFIC, NOT ALLOWED TO

1207
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
GO UP THERE AT THIS TIME.

1208
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
THAT'S THE OTHER AREA WHERE

1209
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
THERE'S A MASSIVE, MASSIVE

1210
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
MEMORIAL.
I SHOWED THAT TO YOU YESTERDAY.

1211
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO

1212
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
HERE FROM PEOPLE, WHILE

1213
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
EVERYBODY AROUND THE COUNTRY AND

1214
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
AROUND THE WORLD WANTS TO SHARE

1215
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
AND WANTS TO KNOW AND WANTS TO

1216
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
BE A PART OF THIS GRIEVING, AND

1217
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
THEY'RE DOING THAT THROUGH US

1218
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
AND THE WINDOW WE PROVIDE THE

1219
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE WOULD LIKE

1220
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
US TO LEAVE.

1221
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
THEY WANT TO RETURN SOME

1222
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
NORMALCY AND THAT BEGS THAT

1223
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
QUESTION, WHEN WE DO GO, WHEN WE

1224
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
LEAVE THIS TOWN AND WHEN OUR

1225
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
WORLD CONTINUES, WE LEAVE ALL OF

1226
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
THESE PEOPLE WITH A BRAND-NEW

1227
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
NORMAL AND SOMETHING THEY'RE

1228
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT FOR

1229
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
THEMSELVES WHAT THEIR NEW NORMAL

1230
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
IS GOING TO BE LIKE.

1231
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE AN

1232
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
ANECDOTE.

1233
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
MOMENTS AGO A MAN BY THE NAME OF

1240
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
HE WAS SO MOVED BY THAT NOTION

1241
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
THAT ONCE WE ALL LEAVE, THEY

1242
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
WILL BE LEFT ALONE WITH THEIR

1243
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
NEW NORMAL.
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1244
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
HE SAID I WANT TO DO SOMETHING.

1245
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1246
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
AND ULTIMATELY HE CAME UP WITH A

1247
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
PLAN AND HE SHARED IT WITH ME

1248
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
MOMENTS AGO.

1249
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000

00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000

1252
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000

1255
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
WHATEVER HE SEES NEEDS DOING

1256
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
HE'S GOING TO DO IT AND HE'S NOT

1257
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
GOING TO ASK FOR ANYTHING IN

1258
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000

A SMALL EXAMPLE OF HOW THE

00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
COMMUNITY PLANS TO BIND TOGETHER

1260
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000

I WAS VERY THANKFUL THAT HE

1262
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
SHARED THAT WITH ME.

1263

WE ARE ALL GRIEVING THROUGH THIS

1264
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY, THE MEDIA

1265
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
INCLUDED.
AND NOW MORE THAN A MILLION

1266

01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
SHOOTING AS A HOBBY AND LIKED TO

1636
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
GO TO THE GUN RANGE.

1637
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
WHAT WAS INTERESTING, NANCY

1638
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000

1640
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
HE CLEARLY HAD ISSUES BUT SHE

1641
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
WAS TRYING TO KEEP THINGS AS

1642
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
NORMAL AS POSSIBLE AND GETTING

1643
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
HIM TO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS WHERE

1644
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000

DESCRIBED AS HIS GENIUS, HIS

1646
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000

01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
TOOK HIM TO THE GUN RANGES,

1656
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T LIKE TO LEAVE

01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
THE SCHOOL, I HAD NO IDEA WHAT

2351
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
IT WAS.

2352
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
>> THE CHILDREN, HOW DID THEY

2353
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
FINE THE WORDS TO TELL YOU?

2354
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
THEY TOLD YOU, RIGHT?

2355
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
THE TEACHER HAD DIE GOOD THEY

2356
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
START TALKING.

2357
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,000
THE TWO BOYS MOSTLY TALKED.

2358
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:09,000
AND THEY SAID, WE CAN'T GO BACK

2359
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
TO THAT SCHOOL -- WE CAN'T --

2360
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
>> WE CAN'T GO BACK.

2361
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
>> OUR TEACHER -- OUR TEACHER'S

2362
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
DEAD.

2363
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

2364
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
WE DON'T HAVE A TEACHER.

2365
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
THEY WERE SO BRAVE AND THEY WERE

2366
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
SO GOOD.

2367
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
THEY -- I BROUGHT DOWN SOME TOYS

2368
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
FROM MY GRANDSON'S TOY CHEST AND

2369
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I GAVE THEM SOME JUICE.

2370
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,000
AND WE CALLED THEIR PARENTS.

2371
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
THEY WERE VERY BRAVE.

2372
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
AND VERY GOOD.

2373
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,000
AND I WAS AMAZED.

2374
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I WAS -- I WAS ASTOUNDED AT WHAT

2375
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
THEY WERE TELLING ME.

2376
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
SOMETHING HAPPENED WITH ONE OF

2377
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
THE BOYS.

2378
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
OUT OF THIS GRIEF AND THIS

2379
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
CARNAGE, AND HE STOPPED AND HE

2380
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
BECAME VERY COMPOSED AND ALL OF

2381
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
A SUDDEN HE STOPPED AND HE

2382
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,000
LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAID, JUST

2383
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
SAYING, YOUR HOUSE IS VERY

2384
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
SMALL.

2388
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
is it really 100 calories?

MORE THAN $1 MILLION A YEAR.

2407
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
IT IS WHAT HE CALLS HIS PLAN B.

2408
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS ITS PLAN IS

2409
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
BETTER AND IT IS ACTUALLY MORE

2410
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
FAIR.
THE WHITE HOUSE PLAN CALLS FOR A

2411
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,000
TAX INCREASE ON EARNINGS ABOVE

2412
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
$400,000 A YEAR.

2413
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
THAT'S A CONCESSION FROM

2414
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO ORIGINALLY

2415
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
WANTED TAXES TO GO UP ON

2416
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
ANYTHING ABOVE $250,000 A YEAR.

2417
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
THE PRESIDENT'S OFFER ALSO CALLS

2418
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000

2419
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
CUTS INCLUDING THOSE ON SOCIAL

2420
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000

2421
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000

BEING ABLE TO RAISE THE NATIONAL

2423
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
DEBT CEILINGS.

2424
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
REPUBLICANS NOT THRILLED WITH

2425
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
THE WHITE HOUSE'S LATEST OFFER.

2426
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
DANA BASH FOLLOWING THE BACK AND

2427
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,000
FORTH HERE.

2428
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
WE KNOW THAT BOTH SIDES SEEM TO

2429
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
BE GIVING A BIT, RIGHT?

2430
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
YOU'VE GOT THE PRESIDENT GOING

01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
FROM $250,000 TO $400,000 AS A

2432
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
THRESHOLD FOR INCREASING TAXES

2433
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
AND THE REPUBLICANS PUSHING THIS

2434
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
PLAN B HERE.

2435
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
WHERE DO THEY MEET?

2436
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY MEET?

2437
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,000
>> Reporter: BOY, IF I COULD

2438
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
ANSWER THAT QUESTION WE WOULD BE

2439
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
ABLE TO GO HOME.

2440
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
LOOK, THIS IS -- THIS IS -- THIS

2441
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,000
IS JUST MORE AGGRESSIVE YOU KNOW

2442
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
KIND OF TO-ING AND FRO-ING WHEN

2443
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
IT COMES TO THE HOUSE SPEAKER'S

2444
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
STRATEGY HERE AND THE REPUBLICAN

2445
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
STRATEGY.
YOU LAID OUT WELL WHAT THE WHITE

2446
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
HOUSE OFFER WAS LAST NIGHT WHEN

2447
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
THE PRESIDENT AND THE SPEAKER

2448
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
MET IN PERSON AT THE WHITE

2449
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
HOUSE.

2450
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
BUT AFTER THAT, THE SPEAKER

2451
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
CONCLUDED THAT HIS NEXT MOVE

2452
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
WOULD BE THIS, THIS PLAN B,

2453
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
BECAUSE HE FEELS THAT WHAT THE

2454
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
PRESIDENT IS OFFER, NOT SO MUCH

2455
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
IN THE WAY OF TAX BUT WAS

2456
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
SPENDING CUTS IS NOT ENOUGH.

2457
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
THAT HE'S NOT COMING DOWN --

2458
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,000
GOING HIGH ENOUGH, RATHER, ON

2459
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
SPENDING CUTS.
WITH THE HOUSE SPEAKER SAYING,

2460
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
AS YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN, HE'S

2461
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
GOING TO TRY TO PUSH LEGISLATION

2462
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
THIS THURSDAY TO EXTEND TAX CUTS

2463
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
FOR THOSE MAKING UP TO $1

2464
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
MILLION SO THAT NOT EVERYBODY'S

2465
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
TAXES WILL GO UP.

2466
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
LISTEN TO HOW HE DESCRIBED IT TO

2467
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
REPORTERS.

2468
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
>> EVERY INCOME TAX FILER IN

2469
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
AMERICA IS GOING TO PAY A HIGHER

2470
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
RATE JANUARY 1st UNLESS CONGRESS

2471
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
ACTS.
SO I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

2472
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
WE PROTECT AS MANY AMERICAN

2473
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
TAXPAYERS AS WE CAN.

2474
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
AND OUR PLAN B WOULD PROTECT

2475
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
AMERICAN TAXPAYERS WHO MAKE $1

2476
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
MILLION OR LESS AND HAVE ALL OF

2477
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
THEIR CURRENT RATES EXTENDED.

2478
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
>> Reporter: NOW, WHAT ARE THE

2479
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
DEMOCRATS SAYING TO THIS?

2480
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
THEY DON'T THINK A LOT OF IT.

2481
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
THE WHITE HOUSE FLATLY REJECTED

2482
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
IT.

2483
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
DEMOCRATS WE'RE TALKING TO ON

2484
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
THE HILL SAY IT'S LAUGHABLE.

2485
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
ONE SENIOR DEMOCRATIC

2486
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
CONGRESSMAN I TALKED TO SAID

2487
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
THAT IT'S MORE OF A PUNCH LINE

2488
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
INSTEAD OF A COMPROMISE BECAUSE

2489
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
THEY FEEL THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

2490
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
THE BIG PICTURE TALKS BETWEEN

2491
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
THE PRESIDENT AND THE SPEAKER

2492
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
THEY'RE FURTHER ALONG THAN THE

2493
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
SPEAKER WILL GIVE THE PRESIDENT

2494
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
CREDIT FOR FOR GIVING IN ON

2495
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
TAXES, FOR GIVING ON WHAT HE

2496
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
CAMPAIGNED ON, AS YOU WELL KNOW

2497
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
FOR FIVE YEARS, WHICH IS RAISING

2498
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
TAX RATES FOR PEOPLE MAKING

2499
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
$250,000 OR MORE.

2500
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
SO WE ARE DEFINITELY STILL IN

2501
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,000
THE BACK AND FORTH PHASE.

2502
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
THIS IS CLEARLY A NEGOTIATING

2503
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
TACTIC BY THE SPEAKER TO TRY TO

2504
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
PUSH THE PRESIDENT TO GIVE MORE

2505
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
ON SPENDING CUTS AND TO AGREE TO

2506
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
LESS WHEN IT COMES TO TAX

2507
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
REVENUE.

2508
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
>> READING THE TEA LEAVES HERE

2509
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
IT DOES SEEM APPARENT THAT THIS

2510
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
IS SOMEWHAT OF A TACTIC, THE

2511
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
NEGOTIATION PROCESS TO GET

2512
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
THROUGHOUT AND PUT FORWARD THE

2513
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
PLAN B, BOTH MEN ARE STILL

2514
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
TALKING.

2515
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
THEY ARE STILL COMMUNICATING.

2516
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
IS THAT A GOOD SIGN?

2517
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
DOES THAT INDICATE THERE'S MORE

2518
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
POSTURING, PUBLIC POSTURING

2519
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
GOING ON HERE THAN WHAT WE'RE

2520
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
SEEING BEHIND THE SCENES?

2521
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
>> Reporter: WE HOPE SO.

2522
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONFIRMATION

2523
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
THAT THE TWO MEN HAVE SPOKEN

2524
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
TODAY.

2525
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
WE KNOW THEY SPOKE LAST NIGHT

2526
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
WHEN THE SPEAKERE64)Ñ TOLD THE

2527
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
PRESIDENT HE WAS GOING FORWARD

2528
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000

BUT THAT'S SORT OF ONE SIDE OF

2536
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
THIS.

2537
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN SIDE

2538
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO

2539
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,000
SELL THIS OVERALL, ABOUT $2

2540
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000

ENOUGH IN SPENDING CUTS BUT

2542
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
THERE'S A DEMOCRATIC SIDE, TOO.

I'M TOLD DEMOCRATS ARE NOT HAPPY

WE WERE MOVING ALONG THE ROAD,

2581
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
THE KIDNAPPERS CAME ACROSS A

01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
REBEL CHECKPOINT, SOMETHING THEY

2583
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
HADN'T EXPECTED.

2584
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
WE WERE IN THE BACK OF WHAT YOU

2585
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
THINK OF AS A MINIVAN.

2586
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
AS WE ARE DRIVING ALONG THE

NO PRESCRIPTION NEEDED.

2760
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:59,000
but with ADVAIR,
I'm breathing better.

2761
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:04,000
So now I can be in
the scene.

2762
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
ADVAIR is
clinically proven to help

2763
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
significantly improve

2764
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
lung function.

2765
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Unlike most COPD medications,

2766
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,000
ADVAIR contains both an
anti-inflammatory

2767
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
and a
long-acting bronchodilator

2768
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,000
working together to help improve
your lung function all day.

2769
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
ADVAIR won't
replace fast-acting inhalers

2770
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
for sudden symptoms

2771
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
and should not be used more
than twice a day.

2772
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
People with
COPD taking ADVAIR

2773
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
may have a higher chance
of pneumonia.

2774
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,000
ADVAIR may increase your
risk of osteoporosis

2775
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
and some eye problems.

2776
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Tell your doctor
if you have a heart condition

2777
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:39,000
or high blood pressure before
taking ADVAIR.

2778
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
If you're still
having difficulty breathing,

2779
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
ask your doctor if including
ADVAIR could help

2780
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
improve your lung function.

01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
EXTRAORDINARY TRAFFIC.

2790
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000

IT IS NOT NORMALLY LIKE THIS.

2795
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
THE TRAFFIC IS COMPROMISED OF

2796
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
PEOPLE FROM SURROUNDING

2797
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000

AND THEN ALSO AN ENORMOUS NUMBER

2802
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
OF MEDIA.

2803
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
ANOTHER THING YOU NOTICE AS YOU

JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING.
YOU SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH

2814
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
TEARS AS THEY DROP OFF WHAT THEY

2815
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,000
BROUGHT.

2816
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,000
OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THE TRAFFIC,

2817
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
PEOPLE FROM SURROUNDING

2818
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000

THE NEXT THING YOU NOTICE IS

01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000

2820
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
PEOPLE HAVE COME FROM ALL OVER

2821
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
THE WORLD TO COVER THIS STORY.

2822
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
AND THEY ARE SET UP RIGHT IN THE

2823
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
TOWN SQUARE, RIGHT IN THE CENTER

2824
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
OF TOWN, A PLACE THAT IS NOT

2825
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
USED TO SEEING SATELLITE TRUCKS

2826
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
AND THIS KIND OF MEDIA

2827
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
ATTENTION.
AND, BOY, ARE THEY GETTING USED

2828
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
TO IT NOW.

2829
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,000
ANOTHER THING THAT YOU'LL FIND

2830
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:20,000
AMIDST ALL THE TRAFFIC, TAKE A

2831
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,000
LOOK UP HERE, POLICE AND ORANGE

2832
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
CONES AND ROAD CLOSED SIGNS,

2833
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
THAT IS THE ROAD THAT LEADS UP

2834
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
TO THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

2835
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,000
SCHOOL.
THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY LIMITING MOST

2836
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
OF THE TRAFFIC, NOT ALLOWED TO

2837
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,000
GO UP THERE AT THIS TIME.

2838
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
THAT'S THE OTHER AREA WHERE

2839
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
THERE IS A MASSIVE, MASSIVE

2840
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
MEMORIAL.
I SHOWED THAT TO YOU YESTERDAY.

2841
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO

2842
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
HEAR FROM PEOPLE, WHILE

2843
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
EVERYBODY AROUND THE COUNTRY AND

2844
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,000
AROUND THE WORLD WANTS TO SHARE

2845
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,000
AND WANTS TO KNOW AND WANTS TO

2846
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
BE A PART OF THIS, THIS

2847
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,000
GRIEVING, AND THEY'RE DOING THAT

2848
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
THROUGH US, AND THE WINDOW WE

2849
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
PROVIDE, THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE

2850
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,000
HERE REALLY WOULD LIKE US TO

2851
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
LEAVE.

2852
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,000
THEY WANT TO RETURN TO SOME KIND

2853
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,000
OF NORMALCY AND THAT BEGS THAT
