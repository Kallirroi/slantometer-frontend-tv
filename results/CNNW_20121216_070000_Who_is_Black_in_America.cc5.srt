1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
DO WHATEVER I CAN.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
TO MAKE SURE THAT MY FAMILY AND
MY WIFE AND MY DAUGHTERS ARE

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
TAKEN CARE OF AND THAT IF

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO
TO HELP ANYBODY AT ANY TIME,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
ANYWHERE, I'D BE WILLING TO DO

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
THAT.
AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT HAPPENED

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO SO MANY

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN INTO

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US, BUT

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US TO BE
BETTER, TO BE MORE COMPASSIONATE

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
AND MORE HUMBLE PEOPLE.

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
THEY'RE ALSO AT THE HOME OF THE

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
MAN IDENTIFIED AS THE SHOOTER,

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
TRYING TO LEARN ANY CLUES THEY
CAN ABOUT WHY HE DID WHAT HE

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
DID, WHY THIS SCHOOL IN

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
PARTICULAR.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL BE HERE

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
TOMORROW VISITING THE FAMILIES

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
OF THE VICTIMS, THE 20 KIDS AND

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
THE SIX ADULTS KILLED IN THE

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
SCHOOL.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
ALSO TALKING TO FIRST RESPONDERS

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
AND TALKING AT A PRAYER VIGIL

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
TOMORROW EVENING.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THOSE

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
YOUNG VICTIMS TONIGHT, THOSE 12

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
GIRLS AND EIGHT LITTLE BOYS SHOT

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
DEAD IN THEIR CLASSROOMS.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
MOST OF WHAT WE'RE LEARNING IS

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
FROM THEIR PARENTS WHO ARE

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
SHARING THEIR GRIEF VERY

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
PUBLICLY TONIGHT.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
KYUNG LAH, YOU WERE THERE

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
EARLIER WHEN THE FATHER OF

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
EMILIE PARKER CAME OUT OF HIS

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
HOUSE AND WANTED TO TELL PEOPLE,

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
WANTED TO TALK TO TV CAMERAS AND

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
JUST TALK IN A VERY HUMAN WAY

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER, ABOUT WHAT

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
SHE WAS LIKE, ABOUT THE LIFE SHE

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
LIVED.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
>> AND HE WAS VERY CLEAR THAT

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
THE REASON HE WANTED TO COME OUT

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
AND FACE CAMERAS -- HE KNOWS

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
THIS IS NATIONAL TELEVISION, HE

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY KNEW THAT HE

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU AND HE

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
ALSO WANTED TO SHARE A MESSAGE,

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
THAT WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS,

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
THAT SOCIETY CANNOT BE DEFINED
BY THIS SINGLE ACT.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
HE LOST A 6-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
AND IT'S ONE THING TO THINK

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
ABOUT THE NUMBER.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
TO WATCH THIS MAN TALK, TO LOOK

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
AT THE PICTURES OF THIS

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
BEAUTIFUL GIRL AND TO FULLY

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
COMPREHEND THAT THIS FAMILY HAS

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
SUFFERED A TRUE, TRUE LOSS.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD US.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
>> I WAS LEAVING TO WORK, AND

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
SHE WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
AND I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TEACHING
HER PORTUGUESE.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
SO OUR LAST CONVERSATION WAS IN

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
PORTUGUESE.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
AND ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
AND I SAID THAT I WAS DOING

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
WELL.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME AND I

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
THE DOOR.

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
WAS AND HOW MANY LIVES THAT SHE

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
WAS ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
TIME HERE ON EARTH.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
VERY LOVING.

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
MY DAUGHTER EMILIE WOULD BE ONE

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE STANDING

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
AND GIVING HER LOVE AND SUPPORT

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS BECAUSE

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
THAT'S THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
SHE IS, NOBECAUSE OF ANY

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
PARENTING THAT MY WIFE AND I

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
COULD HAVE DONE BUT BECAUSE

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THOSE WERE THE GIFTS THAT WERE

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
GIVEN TO HER BY HER HEAVENLY

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
FATHER.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
>> AND HE ALSO SAID THAT HE WAS

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
VERY PROUD TO BE HER FATHER,

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE THE BEST

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
FATHER HE COULD TO HIS TWO

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
REMAINING CHILDREN, A 3-YEAR-OLD

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
AND A 4-YEAR-OLD GIRL, HER

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
SISTERS.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
HE DID ALSO SAY THAT HE WANTED

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
TO MAKE SURE THAT HE EXTENDED

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
HIS CONDOLENCES TO THE SHOOTER'S

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
FAMILY BECAUSE THEY ALSO

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
SUFFERED A LOSS, ANDERSON.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
AND THE THING THAT'S REALLY

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
EXTRAORDINARY IS HOW HE'S ABLE

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
TO GET HIS MESSAGE OUT AND STILL

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
KEEP IT TOGETHER.

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
IT'S REALLY -- IT'S HARD TO

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
WATCH AND TO COMPREHEND.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
>> HOW DOES A FATHER TELL A 3

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
AND A 4-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER THAT

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
THEIR SISTER, THEIR BIG SISTER

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
IS GONE?

116
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
KYUNG LAH, APPRECIATE YOU

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
REPORTING TONIGHT.

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
RESIDENTS OF STRATFORD,

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
CONNECTICUT, REMEMBER VICTORIA

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
SOTO WHO GREW UP THERE.

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
SHE WAS 27 YEARS OLD.

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
SHE TAUGHT FIRST GRADE AT SANDY

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY.

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THEY WERE WEARING THOSE COLORS

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
BECAUSE THAT WAS HER FAVORITE
COLOR, GREEN.

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
JASON CARROLL JOINS ME NOW, MORE

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
ON THE VIGIL.

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
SOUNDS AS THOUGH THE COMMUNITY

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
REALLY ADORED THAT TEACHER AND

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
TONIGHT WANTED TO KIND OF SHOW

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THAT IN A VERY PUBLIC WAY.

133
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
>> YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT,

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
ANDERSON.

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
HERE TONIGHT.

136
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
THE FAMILY SAYING THAT IT

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
BASICALLY ALL STARTED ON

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
FACEBOOK WITH A FACEBOOK

139
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
MESSAGE, LET'S GET TOGETHER,

140
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
LET'S FIND OUT A WAY TO HONOR

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
VICTORIA, VICKI, AS HER FAMILY

142
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
AND TRENDS CALLED HER.

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
VICTORIA SOTO.

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
THAT'S WHAT THEY DID.

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
THEY CAME OUT HERE TONIGHT IN

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
FRONT OF HER HIGH SCHOOL.

147
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
THIS IS WHERE EVERYONE KNEW HER.

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT HER

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
SAYING SHE WANTED TO BE A

150
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
TEACHER EVER SINCE SHE WAS A

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
LITTLE GIRL AND THEY TALKED

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
ABOUT HOW DEDICATED THIS YOUNG

153
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
WOMAN WAS TO HER STUDENTS.

154
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
IN FACT, SHE DIDN'T EVEN REFER

155
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
TO THEM AS STUDENTS.

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
SHE ALWAYS REFERRED TO THEM AS

157
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
HER KIDS, HER CHILDREN.

158
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
AND OUT HERE TONIGHT, AS YOU CAN

159
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
IMAGINE WITH HER SISTER BEING

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
HERE, HER BROTHER BEING HERE,

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
HER PARENTS BEING HERE, HER

162
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
COUSIN HERE AS WELL, AS EVERYONE

163
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
GATHERED TOGETHER AND HUGGED

164
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
EACH OTHER, THEY STRUGGLED TO

165
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
FIND WAYS TO REMEMBER HER.

166
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I SPOKE TO ONE YOUNG WOMAN WHO

167
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
KNEW VICKI SOTA THROUGHOUT HER

168
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
ENTIRE LIFE.

169
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
LISTEN TO HOW SHE SPOKE ABOUT

170
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
HER TONIGHT.

171
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
>> SHE WAS ALWAYS AT THE HOUSE

172
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
SMILING.

173
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
SHE DROVE US TO CHEERLEADING

174
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
PRACTICES A COUPLE OF TIMES.

175
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'M ALSO A TEACHER AND I CAN'T

176
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
EVEN IMAGINE GOING THROUGH WHAT

177
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
SHE WENT THROUGH.

178
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I THINK HER PUTTING HERSELF OUT

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
THERE -- SHE'S JUST AN ANGEL AND

180
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
SHE JUST WENT STRAIGHT INTO

181
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
HEAVEN.

182
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

183
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
>> AS YOU CAN SEE, ANDERSON,

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN EMOTIONAL

185
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
STRUGGLE FOR SO MANY PEOPLE OUT

186
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
HERE TONIGHT.

187
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
AT ONE MOMENT, CARLEY SOTO,

188
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
SHE'S 19 YEARS OLD, SHE STOOD IN

189
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
FRONT OF THE SEVERAL HUNDRED

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
PEOPLE WHO GATHERED OUT HERE

191
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
TONIGHT AND SHE SPOKE JUST

192
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
BRIEFLY, JUST FOR A MOMENT SHE

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
REMINDED THE AUDIENCE TO HUG

194
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
YOUR LOVED ONES BECAUSE YOU JUST

195
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'RE EVER

196
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
GOING TO SEE THEM AGAIN.

197
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
IT WAS A VERY POWERFUL MOMENT AS

198
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
THE FAMILY PAID TRIBUTE TO A

199
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
WOMAN WHO THEY SAY WAS A

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
DEDICATED TEACHER, A LOVING

201
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
DAUGHTER AND SOMEONE WHO LOVED

202
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
HER CHILDREN OR HER STUDENTS.

203
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
ANDERSON?

204
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
>> ONE FAMILY SAYS THEY OWE

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
THEIR SON'S LIFE TO VICKI SOTO.

206
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
THEY SPOKE WITH KATE BOLDUAN

207
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
ABOUT THEIR CHILD'S ORDEAL

208
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
YESTERDAY AND HOW SHE'S COPING

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
WITH WHAT HE'S SEEN.

210
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
>> ROBERT AND DIANE LIKATA HAD

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
TWO CHILDREN AT THAT ELEMENTARY

212
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
SCHOOL YESTERDAY, A

213
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
SECOND-GRADER AND THEIR SON IN

214
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
FIRST GRADE WHO THEY SAY IT IS A

215
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
MIRACLE HE MADE IT OUT ALIVE

216
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
AFTER COMING FACE TO FACE WITH

217
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
THE SHOOTER.

218
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
>> THAT'S WHEN THEY HEARD NOISES

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
THAT THEY INITIALLY THOUGHT WERE

220
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
HAMMERS FALLING.

221
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
THEN THEY REALIZED THAT IT WAS

222
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
GUNSHOTS.

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
AND MS. SOTO, WHO WAS ADEN'S

224
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
TEACHER, HAD THE PRESENCE OF

225
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
MIND TO MOVE ALL THE CHILDREN TO

226
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
A DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE DOOR ON

227
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
THE SIDE OF THE ROOM FURTHEST
AWAY FROM THE DOOR.

228
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THAT'S WHEN THE GUNMAN BURST IN,

229
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
DID NOT SAY A WORD, NO FACIAL

230
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
EXPRESSIONS, AND PROCEEDED TO

231
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
SHOOT THEIR TEACHER.

232
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
AND THEY BASICALLY RAN RIGHT

233
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
NEXT TO THE GUY AND OUT THE

234
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
DOOR.

235
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
>> THEY RAN PAST THE GUNMAN.

236
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
>> THEY RAN PAST THE GUY.

237
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
HE'S STILL STANDING IN THE DOOR

238
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
AND THEY RAN PAST HIM AND RAN

239
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
DOWN THE HALLWAY AND THEY'RE ONE

240
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
OF THE CLOSEST ROOMS TO THE MAIN

241
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
ENTRANCE.

242
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
AND ADEN WAS -- HAD THE PRESENCE

243
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
OF MIND TO HOLD THE DOOR FOR ONE

244
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
OF HIS CLASSMATES.

245
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE OF HIS

246
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
CLASSMATES THAT WAS A LITTLE

247
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
BEHIND.

248
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
WAITED FOR HIM AND THEY RAN OUT

249
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
TO THE MAIN ROAD.

250
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
>> WE KNOW HIS TEACHER, VICTORIA

251
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
SOTO, DIED IN THAT CLASSROOM

252
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
TRYING TO PROTECT HER STUDENTS.

253
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
HE KNOWS HIS TEACHER WAS SHOT.

254
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
DO YOU THINK HE KNOWS THAT SHE

255
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
LIKELY DID NOT MAKE IT?

256
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
>> HE KEEPS ASKING ABOUT HER.

257
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I THINK HE'S REASSURING HIMSELF

258
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

259
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
HE REALLY, REALLY CARED ABOUT

260
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
HIS TEACHER.

261
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
HE WAS VERY CLOSE WITH HER.

262
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
AND SHE REALLY LOVED THAT CLASS.

263
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
AND HE KEEPS SAYING, I REALLY

264
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
HOPE SHE'S OKAY, I HOPE IT'S NOT

265
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
HER.

266
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
HE KNOWS THAT SHE'S BEEN HURT

267
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW THE END

268
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
RESULT.

269
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
HE KNOWS THE KIDS THAT HE SAW

270
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
GETTING SHOT.

271
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE OUTCOME.

272
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
SO I THINK HE'S REASSURING

273
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
HIMSELF IN HIS 6-YEAR-OLD MIND.

274
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I KNOW HE'S PROCESSING IT.

275
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
BUT I THINK HE'S REASSURING

276
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
HIMSELF.

277
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I THINK HE'S TELLING HIMSELF
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

278
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
WE HAD TO PUT THE SIGN OUT IN

279
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
THE FRONT TODAY ASKING PEOPLE

280
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
NOT TO RING THE DOORBELL BECAUSE

281
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
HE STILL HASN'T INTERNALIZED THE

282
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
FACT THAT THIS GUNMAN, THIS BAD

283
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
GUY IS GONE.

284
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
AND HE WANTS TO KNOW IF THERE

285
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
ARE MORE BAD GUYS IN THE WORLD.

286
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER

287
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
THAT QUESTION PROPERLY AND SO

288
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
WHEN SOMEONE RINGS THE DOORBELL,

289
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
HE THINKS IT'S HIM COMING

290
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
BACK -- COMING FOR HIM.

291
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
AND SO HE -- SO I THINK OUR

292
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
BIGGEST CONCERN NOW IS MAKING

293
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
SURE THAT WE HANDLE HIS

294
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
SENSITIVE NATURE PROPERLY AND

295
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
CAREFULLY AND SUPPORT HIM AND

296
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
SUPPORT OUR DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE

297
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
AGAIN DOES PROCESS THINGS VERY

298
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
DIFFERENTLY THAN HE DOES.

299
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
SO THAT'S OUR JOB AS PARENTS NOW

300
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
IS TO STAY CLOSE TO THEM, HOLD

301
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THEM, HUG THEM, LOVE THEM AND

302
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE

303
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
SAFE.

304
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
>> THEY DID NOT WANT THEIR

305
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
CHILDREN TO BE PART OF THE

306
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
INTERVIEW.

307
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
BUT I DID SPEND TIME WITH THEM

308
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
THIS MORNING.

309
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
AND ADEN AND HIS SISTER, THEY

310
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
SEEMED IN HIGH SPIRITS.

311
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
BUT CLEARLY SHAKEN.

312
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
AND AS HARD AS IT HAS BEEN FOR

313
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
THIS FAMILY, THEY SAY THAT THEIR

314
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
HEARTS GO OUT TO THE SO MANY

315
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
OTHER FAMILIES WHO CANNOT GO

316
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
HOME AND HUG THEIR CHILDREN

317
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
TONIGHT.

318
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
ANDERSON?

319
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
>> KATE THANK YOU.

320
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
ONE OF THE BUSIEST PLACES IN

321
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, TODAY MAY

322
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
HAVE BEEN THE GRIEF COUNSELING

323
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
CENTER, BOTH VICTIMS AND THOSE

324
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
AFFECTED BY WHAT HAPPENED FRIDAY

325
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
GOT THE CHANCE TO SPEAK TO

326
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
SOMEONE IF THEY WANTED ABOUT

327
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
WHAT THEY WERE FEELING.

328
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
FOR SOME, THE HEALING COMES IN

329
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
HONORING THOSE VICTIMS.

330
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
ALL DAY LONG, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

331
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
CREATING GIANT MEMORIALS TO

332
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
THOSE WHO WERE KILLED.

333
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'M JOINED NOW BY DR. SANJAY

334
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
GUPTA WHO WAS AT THAT COUNSELING

335
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
CENTER EARLIER.

336
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
WE'RE LOOKING AT A PICTURE THERE

337
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
OF ONE OF THE MAKESHIFT

338
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
MEMORIALS THAT'S SPRUNG UP, SO

339
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
OFTEN SPRUNG UP IN TRAGEDIES

340
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
LIKE THIS.

341
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
PEOPLE SPONTANEOUSLY EXPRESSING

342
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
THEIR SORROW, EXPRESSING THEIR

343
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
GRIEF AND THEIR REMEMBRANCES IN

344
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
WAYS LARGE AND SMALL.

345
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
YOU'VE ACTUALLY BEEN LOOKING AT

346
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
STUDIES ABOUT HOW KIDS IN THIS

347
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
AGE RANGE, YOUNG KIDS, DEAL WITH

348
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
WITNESSING A TRAUMATIC EVENT.

349
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, PTSD IS

350
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
SOMETHING WE TYPICALLY THINK OF

351
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
WITH ADULTS.

352
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THEM WITH

353
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
CHILDREN VERY MUCH AND CERTAINLY

354
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
CHILDREN THIS YOUNG.

355
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
IT EXISTS VERY MUCH SO THE WAY

356
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
THAT THEY -- THEY'RE BEHAVIOR IS

357
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
DIFFERENT.

358
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
THEY DON'T HAVE THE FLASHBACKS,

359
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
THE SORT OF HYPERVIGILANCE THAT

360
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
WE ASSOCIATE WITH PTSD.

361
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
OFTENTIMES YOU SEE IT IN THE WAY

362
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
THEY PLAY, SOMETIMES YOU SEE IT

363
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
IN THE WAY THAT THEY REGRESS.

364
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
THEY MAY START ACTING YOUNGER.

365
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
THEY MAY BE MORE CLINGY.

366
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
THEY MAY HAVE TEMPER TANTRUMS OR

367
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
BEHAVIOR THAT SEEMS OUT OF

368
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
SORTS.

369
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
OFTENTIMES, CAREGIVERS DON'T

370
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.

371
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
>> DOES IT SORT OF -- THE

372
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
TIMETABLE, DOES IT PLAY OUT

373
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
IMMEDIATELY OR IS IT SOMETHING

374
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
THAT SHOWS OUTPATIENT MONTHS

375
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
LATER?

376
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
>> NO, IT OFTEN SHOWS UP VERY

377
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
EARLY.

378
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT

379
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
BECAUSE IF YOU NOTICE IT EARLY,

380
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
THAT'S PRETTY NORMAL FOR BOTH

381
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
ADULTS AND CHILDREN ALIKE.

382
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
IF IT TURNS INTO NIGHTMARES,

383
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
ANXIETY OR LOSS OF SLEEP, THAT'S

384
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
WHEN USUALLY IT'S TIME TO TRY

385
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
AND MAYBE GET SOME HELP.

386
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE

387
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
BIT LAST NIGHT, ANDERSON.

388
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STUDY

389
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
SPECIFICALLY ON SLEEP, IT'S

390
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
COMPELLING STUFF.

391
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
IF SOMEBODY GETS GOOD SLEEP,

392
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
GOOD QUALITY SLEEP, YOU CAN

393
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
PREDICT MUCH MORE ACCURATELY HOW

394
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
WELL THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

395
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
COPE IN THE LONG RUN.

396
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
AND THAT SLEEP IN THE FIRST FEW

397
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
NIGHTS, LAST NIGHT, TONIGHT,

398
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
PARENTS WATCHING THEIR CHILD'S

399
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
SLEEP PATTERNS TONIGHT IS REALLY

400
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
IMPORTANT.

401
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
>> DEFINITELY FASCINATING.

402
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT A

403
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, I THINK IT

404
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
BEARS REPEATING BECAUSE I THINK

405
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
IT HAS CONCERNED A LOT OF

406
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
PARENTS, PARENTS WHOSE KIDS ARE

407
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
ON THE SPECTRUM OF AUTISM OR

408
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
HAVE ASPERGER'S.

409
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
YESTERDAY THERE HAD BEEN A QUOTE

410
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
FROM THE BROTHER OF THE SHOOTER

411
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
WHO THOUGHT HIS BROTHER HAD A

412
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
FORM OF ASPERGER'S AND ALSO A

413
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

414
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
AUTISM IS NOT A PERSONALITY

415
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
DISORDER.

416
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
LET'S CLARIFY --

417
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
>> YES, AS YOU ALWAYS SAY, TERMS

418
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
DO MATTER HERE.

419
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AUTISM OR

420
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
ANYTHING ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM

421
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
AS THEY CALL IT, IT'S A

422
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER.

423
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN

424
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
THE BRAIN SINCE TIME OF BIRTH.

425
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
THAT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

426
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
THAN A PERSONALITY DISORDER OR

427
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
EVEN A MENTAL ILLNESS WHICH

428
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
COULD COME ON LATER IN LIFE.

429
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
BUT THE MORE CRUCIAL POINT IS

430
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
IT'S NOT ASSOCIATED WITH SORT OF

431
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
PLANNED VIOLENCE.

432
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
IT JUST ISN'T.

433
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
>> I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A YOUNG

434
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
PERSON WITH AUTISM COMMITTING A

435
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
PREPLANNED ACT OF VIOLENCE.

436
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
>> I HADN'T EITHER.

437
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
BUT I WENT AND LOOKED AT THE

438
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
STUDIES AGAIN.

439
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
THE STUDY THAT EVERYONE QUOTESES

440
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
IS A STUDY OF ABOUT 132 PEOPLE,

441
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
THAT'S NOT A HUGE STUDY BUT IT'S

442
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
ONE OF THE BIGGEST STUDIES OUT
THERE.

443
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
OF THOSE 132, THERE WERE ONLY

444
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
THREE SORT OF EPISODES OF

445
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
VIOLENCE.

446
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
AS YOU MENTIONED, NONE OF THEM

447
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
PREPLANNED.

448
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
THERE'S NO LINK.

449
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I THINK I CAN SAFELY SAY THERE'S

450
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
NO LINK BETWEEN AUTISM SPECTRUM

451
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
AND PREPLANNED VIOLENCE.

452
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
WE CAN DISPEL THAT --

453
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
>> THERE ARE SO MANY KIDS WHO

454
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
ARE NOW DIAGNOSED SOMEWHERE ON

455
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
THE AUTISM SPECK TRIM.

456
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF

457
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
PARENTS, OUTRAGED THAT PEOPLE

458
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
ARE USING THE TERM AUTISM AND

459
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
LINKING IT SOMEHOW TO THE

460
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
SHOOTING.

461
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
YOU JUST CLARIFIED --

462
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
>> I HOPE THEY'RE WATCHING.

463
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I THINK IT'S AN EDUCATIONAL
POINT.

464
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

465
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE KIND

466
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
OF -- WHAT SHOULD PARENTS BE

467
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
WATCHING FOR, DO YOU THINK, IN
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS?

468
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
>> I THINK THERE IS A -- THERE'S

469
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
A LOT OF NORMAL SORT OF GRIEF

470
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
THAT'S GOING ON.

471
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I THINK OBVIOUSLY WITH CHILDREN,

472
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SORT OF THE
THING -- IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

473
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
THE THINGS YOU MIGHT EXPECT.

474
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
ADULTS HAVE A MUCH BETTER WAY OF

475
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
VERBALIZING THESE THINGS.

476
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

477
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
PARENTS TO NOW AND A LOT OF

478
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
EXPERTS HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS.

479
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
BUT THIS IS NORMAL IN THE FIRST
FEW DAYS.

480
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF IT

481
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
PROGRESSES LONGER TERM, THEN

482
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
PEOPLE DO NEED TO GET HELP.

483
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
THERE IS HELP AVAILABLE HERE P

484
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
PHONE LINES BUT ALSO A GRIEF

485
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
CENTER AVAILABLE.

486
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
IF IT'S PERSISTENT, THAT HELP

487
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
NEEDS -- THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

488
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
THINKING OF MENTAL ILLNESS OR

489
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
THESE TYPES OF PROBLEMS WITH

490
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
PHYSICAL ILLNESS AS IT IS.

491
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
WE TEND TO PUT THESE THINGS IN

492
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
DIFFERENT BUCKETS.

493
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
THE IDEA THAT YOU THINK ABOUT

494
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
MENTAL ILLNESS AS YOU DO IN

495
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
CARDIAC DISEASE -- IT'S

496
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
STIGMATIZED.

497
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES.

498
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
WE TALK ABOUT IT IN SITUATIONS

499
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
LIKE THIS.

500
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
BUT HOPEFULLY IT WILL CATCH ON.

501
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
>> FOR PARENTS WHO HAVE A CHILD

502
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
WITH SOME SORT OF MENTAL

503
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
DISORDER -- AND THERE'S A LOT WE

504
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS SHOOTER.

505
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
BUT IN PAST CASES, IN THE

506
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
VIRGINIA TECH INSTANCE, PARENTS

507
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
TRIED TO GET HELP FOR THE CHILD

508
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
OR FOR THE YOUNG ADULT.

509
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
AND UNLESS THAT PERSON CAN BE

510
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
PROVED TO BE VIOLENT OR IS A

511
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
THREAT TO THEMSELVES OR SOMEBODY

512
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
ELSE, THEY OFTEN CAN'T GET HELP.

513
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

514
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
PARENTS CAN ANGUISH OVER THIS.

515
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
OFTENTIMES, THEY KNEW THE SIGNS

516
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
BUT COULDN'T GET HELP.

517
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
YOU MENTIONED VIRGINIA TECH,

518
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
THREE MONTHS LATER,

519
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
THREE-QUARTERS OF THE STUDENTS

520
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
STILL HAD SOME FORM OF PTSD.

521
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
THIS CAN LAST QUITE A LONG TIME.

522
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
>> THANK YOU, SANJAY.

523
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000

532
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
IT CANNOT CHANGE
HOW THE DISEASE PROGRESSES.

533
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
HOSPITALIZATION
AND RARELY DEATH

534
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000

536
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000

AND DIARRHEA.

THEY HAD A SUSPECT WHO WAS DOWN.

669
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
THEY HAD CLEARED THE BUILDING.

670
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000

BE DONE OBVIOUSLY.

THE THINKING IS PEOPLE MOVED TO

THIS AREA BECAUSE OF THE SCHOOL

724

SYSTEMS.

725
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
SO IT STRIKES A PARTICULAR CHORD

726
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
THAT THIS OCCURRED WITHIN AN

ATTENDED SOME OF THE SHOOTING

737

MY DAUGHTER, EMILIE, WOULD BE

888
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE

SUPPORT TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS

891
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF

892
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
PERSON THAT SHE IS, NOT BECAUSE

893
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
OF ANY PARENTING THAT MY WIFE

894
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
AND I COULD HAVE DONE, BUT

895
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE GIFTS

896
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY HER

897
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000

898
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000

902
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
WHEN I'VE GOTTEN ON THAT AND

903
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
SEEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

904
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
HAVE COMMENTED AND EXPRESSED

905
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
THEIR CONDOLENCES, IT'S BEEN
QUITE OVERWHELMING.

906
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

907
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

908
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

909
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

910
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
WAS AND HOW MANY LIVES THAT SHE

911
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
WAS ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT

912
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
TIME HERE ON EARTH.

913
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

914
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
VERY LOVING.

915
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
EMILIE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO TRY

916
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
NEW THINGS, OTHER THAN FOOD.

917
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
SHE LOVED TO USE HER TALENTS TO

918
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
TOUCH THE LIVES OF EVERYONE THAT

919
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
SHE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH.

920
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
SHE WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL ARTIST

921
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
AND SHE ALWAYS CARRIED AROUND

922
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
HER MARKERS AND PENCILS SO SHE

923
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
NEVER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO

924
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
DRAW A PICTURE OR MAKE A CARD

925
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
FOR THOSE AROUND HER.

926
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF

927
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
TIMES EMILIE NOTICED SOMEONE

928
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
FEELING SAD OR FRUSTRATED AND

929
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
WOULD RUSH TO FIND A PIECE OF

930
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
PAPER TO DRAW THEM A PICTURE OR

931
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
TO WRITE THEM AN ENCOURAGING

932
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
NOTE.

933
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
EMILIE'S CARD MAKING WAS

934
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
EXPRESSED BEAUTIFULLY THIS LAST

935
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
OCTOBER WHEN SHE PLACED A VERY

936
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
SPECIAL CARD SHE HAD MADE INTO

937
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
THE CASKET WITH HER GRANDPA, WHO

938
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
ALSO JUST RECENTLY DIED OF A

939
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
TRAGIC ACCIDENT.

940
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER TWO

941
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
LITTLE SISTERS AND DELIGHTED IN

942
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ, DANCE

943
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS IN

944
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
LIFE.

945
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
EMILIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS

946
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE

947
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
PLEASURE TO MEET HER WOULD AGREE

948
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
THAT THIS WORLD IS A BETTER

949
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
PLACE BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN IN IT.

950
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
SHE WAS THEIR BEST FRIEND.

951
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
THEY WERE ALL BORN WITHIN THREE

952
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
YEARS OF EACH OTHER SO BY LAW,

953
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE.

954
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
SHE WAS TEACHING MY MIDDLE

955
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
DAUGHTER TO READ.

956
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
SHE WOULD HELP MY YOUNGEST

957
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
DAUGHTER LEARN HOW TO MAKE

958
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
THINGS, SHOW HER HOW TO DO
CRAFTS.

959
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
THEY LOOKED UP TO HER AND THEY

960
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
LOOKED TO HER WHEN THEY NEEDED
COMFORT.

961
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
USUALLY THAT'S SAVED FOR A MOM

962
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
AND A DAD.

963
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
BUT IT WAS REALLY SWEET TO SEE

964
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
THE TIMES WHEN ONE OF THEM WOULD

965
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
FALL OR GET THEIR FEELINGS HURT,

966
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
HOW THEY WOULD RUN TO EMILIE TO

967
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
GET SUPPORT AND HUGS AND KISSES.

968
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT

969
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
COULD JUST LIGHT UP A ROOM.

970
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING KIND TO

971
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
SAY ABOUT ANYBODY.

972
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
AND HER LOVE AND THE STRENGTH

973
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
THAT SHE GAVE US AND THE EXAMPLE

974
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
THAT SHE SHOWED TO US IS

975
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
REMARKABLE.

976
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON.

977
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
AND I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER

978
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
DAD.

979
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I WAS LEAVING TO WORK AND SHE

980
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT.

981
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
AND I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TEACHING

982
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
HER PORTUGUESE.

983
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
SO OUR LAST CONVERSATION WAS IN

984
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
PORTUGUESE.

985
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
AND SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING.

986
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

987
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I SAID THAT I WAS DOING WELL.

988
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME.

989
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT
THE DOOR.

990
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
FREE AGENCY IS GIVEN TO ALL OF

991
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
US TO ACT AND DO WHAT WE WANT.

992
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM
US.

993
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

994
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
THAT HE WAS GIVEN AND THAT'S

995
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
WHAT HE CHOSE TO DO WITH IT.

996
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I KNOW THAT GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT

997
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
AWAY.

998
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I'M NOT MAD BECAUSE I HAVE MY

999
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
AGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT I USE

1000
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
THIS EVENT TO DO WHAT I CAN TO

1001
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
DO WHATEVER I CAN.

1002
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY

1003
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
FAMILY AND MY WIFE AND MY

1004
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
DAUGHTERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF AND

1005
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
THAT IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I

1006
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
CAN DO TO HELP ANYBODY AT ANY

1007
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
TIME, ANYWHERE, I'D BE WILLING

1008
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
TO DO THAT.

1009
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT HAPPENED

1010
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO SO MANY

1011
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN INTO

1012
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US, BUT

1013
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US TO BE

1014
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
BETTER, TO BE MORE COMPASSIONATE

1015
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
AND MORE HUMBLE PEOPLE.

1016
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
>> A FATHER IN MOURNING SPEAKING

1017
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
OF COMPASSION FOR OTHERS.

1018
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT SCHOOL IS

1019
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
SADLY JUST THE LATEST ON A LONG

1020
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
LIST OF VIOLENT ATTACKS WITH

1021
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
GUNS OVER THE YEARS.

1022
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
WHEN WE FIRST HEARD WHAT

1023
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
HAPPENED IN CONNECTICUT, PEOPLE

1024
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
PROBABLY THOUGHT ABOUT THE OTHER

1025
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
DEADLY SHOOTINGS.

1026
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
JOINING ME NOW IS PASTOR ROCKY

1027
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000

LITTLETON, COLORADO, WHEN THE

1029
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
COLUMBINE SITUATION OCCURRED.

1030
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY FOR FAMILIES WHO

1031
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
COME TO YOU AND PEOPLE IN THIS

1032
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
COMMUNITY WHO WEREN'T EVEN

1034
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
SCHOOL BUT WHO JUST -- EVERYBODY

FEELS AFFECTED.

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

1037
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
>> YEAH, AS A CHRISTIAN, WHAT

CAN YOU SAY TO START WITH?

1039
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
BUT AS A CHRISTIAN, YOU TELL

1040
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
THEM, THERE'S HOPE IN THE LORD.

1041
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
GOD KNOWS WHERE YOU'RE AT.

1042
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
GOD CARES FOR YOU AND LOVES YOU.

1043
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
RATHER THAN SAYING A LOT ABOUT

1044
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
JESUS, TRYING TO BE LIKE JESUS.

1045
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
>> IT SEEMS, TOO, A LOT OF TIMES

1046
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
JUST BEING THERE IS IMPORTANT

1047
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
AND LISTENING IS AS IMPORTANT AS

1048
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
WHAT YOU SAY.

1049
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
>> YEAH, VERY MUCH SO.

1050
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
THAT'S WHAT ANYBODY NEEDS IN

1051
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
THIS KIND OF SETTING.

1052
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
AND HAVING BEEN IN THIS SETTING

1053
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
A TIME BEFORE, AND ACTUALLY I'M

1054
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
GLAD TO BE AROUND TO BE ABLE TO

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000

>> YEAH, RIGHT PLACE AT THE

1059
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
RIGHT TIME.

1060
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
AND THE CHURCH THAT I PASTOR, I

1061
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
THINK THEY FEEL THAT WAY, TOO.

1062
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
WE'VE BEEN CONDUCTING PRAYER

1063
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
MEETINGS IN THE AREA, PRAYING

1064
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000

1065
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
AND GETTING IN TOUCH WITH GOD

1066

00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
HELPFUL TOWARD OTHER PEOPLE.

1069
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
>> IT IS EXTRAORDINARY -- I'VE

1070
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
SPENT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME IN

1071
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
THIS TOWN.

1072
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
JUST TO SEE HOW PEOPLE ARE

1073
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
COMING TOGETHER.

1074
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
PEOPLE ARE STOPPING HERE, PEOPLE

1075
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
OF REACHING OUT TO ONE ANOTHER

1079
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
IN GRIEF AND IN SADNESS.

1080
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
>> YEAH, I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1081
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING IN ALL OF

US THAT CAN HELP ALLEVIATE THE

1083
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
PAIN WHEN WE GO THROUGH A CRISIS

1084
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
SITUATION.

1085
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
WE NEED EACH OTHER AND THAT'S

1086
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS

1087
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
ABOUT COMMUNITY.

1088
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
>> DO YOU ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO
TALK ABOUT IT?

1089
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I LOST A BROTHER YEARS AGO TO

1090
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
SUICIDE.

1091
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
AND MY MOM FOUND IT HELPFUL TO

1092
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
TALK ABOUT IT OVER AND OVER
AGAIN.

1093
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
AND I FOUND IT VERY, VERY

1094
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
DIFFICULT AND EVEN STILL TO THIS

1095
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
DAY.

1096
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
DO YOU ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TALK?

1097
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
>> I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TALK

1098
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
ABOUT IT.

1099
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
AND I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TALK

1100
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
TO THE LORD ABOUT IT.

1101
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
SOMETIMES WE FORGET THAT WE CAN

1102
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
TALK TO GOD, TALK TO HIM

1103
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
DIRECTLY.

1104
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
AND HE UNDERSTANDS IN A WAY THAT

1105
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
A PERSON REALLY CAN'T.

1106
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
AGAIN, EVERYTHING I'M ABOUT IS

1107
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
LOOKING TO HIM.

1108
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
>> THERE ARE NO DOUBT PEOPLE WHO

1109
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
WITNESS WHAT HAPPENED AND

1110
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
QUESTION FAITH, QUESTION HOW CAN

1111
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
THIS HAPPEN -- HOW CAN THIS BE

1112
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
ALLOWED TO HAPPEN?

1113
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
HOW DO YOU ANSWER?

1114
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
>> THAT'S THE AGE-OLD QUESTION.

1115
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I LOOK AT EVIL -- TO BELIEVE IN

1116
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
EVIL, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN

1117
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
GOOD.

1118
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I GO BACK TO THE STORY OF

1119
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
CREATION.

1120
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
GOD'S THE CREATOR AND THERE IS

1121
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
AN ADVERSARY, THERE IS AN ENEMY.

1122
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
GOD'S NOT THE AUTHOR OF THIS.

1123
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
THE BIBLE SAYS THAT GOD IS THE

1124
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
AUTHOR OF ABUNDANT LIFE.

1125
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
THE DEVIL IS THE AUTHOR OF THIS

1126
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
KIND OF LIFE.

1127
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
HE COMES TO STEAL, KILL AND

1128
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
DESTROY.

1129
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
IT'S SAD.

1130
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
BUT GOD IS BIGGER THAN THAT.

1131
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
THAT'S WHY WE POINT PEOPLE

1132
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
TOWARDS HIM IN THIS KIND OF

1133
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
SCENARIO.

1134
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
>> AND FAITH GETS YOU THROUGH?

1135
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
>> FAITH GETS YOU THROUGH.

1136
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I THINK PEOPLE FIND THAT FAITH

1137
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
GETS THEM THROUGH A LOT OF

1138
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT THINK
IT WILL AT THE TIME.

1139
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
HAVING LIVED IN COLUMBINE, I SAW

1140
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
THIS ONCE BEFORE -- OR IN DENVER

1141
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
DURING COLUMBINE, SAW THIS ONCE

1142
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
BEFORE.

1143
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
IT'S AMAZING.

1144
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
CHANGED MY LIFE WATCHING HOW

1145
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
OTHER PEOPLE -- HOW GOD DID HELP

1146
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
THEM AND DID GET THEM THROUGH

1147
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
TIMES WHEN THEY THOUGHT THEY

1148
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
WOULDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH.

1149
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
>> AND TO SEE PARENTS -- TO SEE

1150
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
MR. PARKER SPEAKING ABOUT HIS

1151
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
DAUGHTER, THE STRENGTH THAT

1152
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
TAKES, THE STRENGTH THAT TAKES

1153
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
JUST TO GET THROUGH MINUTE BY

1154
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
MINUTE, SECOND BY SECOND.

1155
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
>> YEAH.

1156
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
NO, THAT WAS VERY TOUCHING

1157
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
THERE.

1158
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
IT'S JUST A HORRIBLE SCENARIO, A

1159
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
HORRIBLE SITUATION.

1160
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
LIKE WE SAID IN THE BEGINNING,

1161
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
WORDS CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING

1162
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
IN THIS.

1163
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
HOW CAN I UNDERSTAND HIM?

1164
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I JUST TRY TO LOVE HIM AND BE

1165
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
THERE FOR HIM AND PEOPLE LIKE

1166
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
HIM, BE THERE IN THE COMMUNITY.

1167
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
>> SOMETIMES THE WORDS SEEM --

1168
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
THEY FEEL SO SMALL IN A

1169
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS.

1170
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
PASTOR, APPRECIATE YOU BEING ON.

1171
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1172
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
>> THERE'S STILL A LOT FOR US TO

1173
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
LEARN IN THE DAYS AHEAD AND AS

1174
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES.

1175
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
WE'LL TAKE A SHORT BREAK.

1176
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
WE'LL CONTINUE REMEMBERING THE

1177
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
VICTIMS TONIGHT WHEN WE COME

1178
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
BACK.

1179
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
FOR THEIR ANNUAL FOOTBALL.

1180
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
THAT'S DOUBLE MILES
YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE.

1181
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
TRAGICALLY, THEIR BUDDY
GOT SACKED BY BLACKOUTS.

1182
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
BUT IT'S OUR TRADITION!

1183
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
THAT'S ROUGHING
THE CARD HOLDER.

1184
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
BUT WITH
THE Capital One Venture Card

1185
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
YOU GET DOUBLE MILES
YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE.

1186
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
[ cheering ]

1187
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
ANY FLIGHT, ANYTIME.

1188
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
THE SCOREBOARD DOESN'T LIE.

1189
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
WHAT'S IN YOUR WALLET? HUT!

1190
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I HAVE ME ON MY FANTASY TEAM.

1191
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
IT'S NOT FOR COLDS,

1192
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
IT'S NOT FOR PAIN,
IT'S JUST FOR SLEEP.

1193
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
BECAUSE SLEEP
IS A BEAUTIFUL THING.

1194
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
♪

1195
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
ZZZQUIL,

1196
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
THE NON-HABIT FORMING SLEEP-AID
FROM THE MAKERS OF NYQUIL.

1197
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
>>> THIS IS A VERY, VERY TRAGIC,

1198
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
TRAGIC SCENE FOR EVERYBODY.

1199
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
CERTAINLY OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN

1200
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
FOR THE FAMILIES HERE.

1201
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, ABOUT 9:30,

1202
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
9:40, WE HEARD NOISES.

1203
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM WAS

1204
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
STILL ON.

1205
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
SO IT DIDN'T GO OFF.

1206
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
SO YOU COULD HEAR WHAT SOUNDED

1207
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
LIKE POPS, GUNSHOTS.

1208
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
>> HER TEACHER MANAGED TO TAKE

1209
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
TWO CHILDREN OUT OF THE HALLWAY,

1210
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
PULL THEM INTO THE CLASSROOM,

1211
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
LOCK THE DOOR AND MOVE EVERYBODY

1212
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
ROOM.

1213
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
>> WE JUST TOLD A LITTLE BOY

1214
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
ABOUT HIS SISTER NOW.

1215
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
HE SAID, WHO AM I GOING TO PLAY

1216
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
WITH NOW?

1217
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I HAVE NOBODY TO PLAY WITH NOW.

1218
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
EXCUSE ME.

1219
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
>> WHEN YOUR FIRST-GRADER GOES

1220
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
TO BED AND SAYS, MOMMY, IS

1221
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
ANYONE FROM MY CLASS LAST

1222
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
YEAR -- ARE THEY ALL OKAY?

1223
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
AND YOU LOOK AT THEM AND SAY,

1224
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

1225
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
>> YOU CAN NEVER BE PREPARED FOR

1226
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
THIS KIND OF INCIDENT.

1227
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
WHAT HAS HAPPENED, WHAT HAS

1228
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
TRANSPIRED AT THAT SCHOOL

1229
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
BUILDING WILL LEAVE A MARK ON

1230
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
THIS COMMUNITY AND EVERY FAMILY

1231
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
IMPACTED.

1232
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
>> AS I'VE BEEN SAYING SINCE THE

1233
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
BEGINNING OF OUR COVERAGE, WE

1234
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
WANT TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE

1235
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
VICTIMS, ON THE LIVES THEY

1236
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
LIVED.

1237
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
AND WE WANT TODAY TO TRY TO

1238
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
LEARN AS MUCH AS WE CAN ABOUT

1239
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
THEM AND IN THE DAYS AHEAD, TO

1240
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
LEARN AS MUCH AS WE CAN ABOUT

1241
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
THEM AS WHEN THEIR FAMILIES WANT

1242
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
THAT INFORMATION OUT.

1243
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T HAVE

1244
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
PICTURES OF MANY OF THE VICTIMS.

1245
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
WE'RE WAITING OF COURSE FOR

1246
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
FAMILIES TO RELEASE THAT IF AND

1247
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
WHEN THEY CHOOSE TO.

1248
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
BUT WE DO HAVE THEIR NAMES
TONIGHT.

1249
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE A FEW

1250
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
MOMENTS AND JUST READ YOU THEIR

1251
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
NAMES SO THAT YOU REMEMBER THEIR

1252
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
NAMES.

1253
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
SO OFTEN WE REMEMBER THE NAMES

1254
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
OF THE SHOOTERS IN THESE KIND OF

1255
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
SITUATIONS.

1256
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

1257
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
REMEMBER THE NAMES OF THE

1258
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000

OLD AS WELL.

1303
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
WE REMEMBER THEM ALL TONIGHT AND

1304
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
IN THE DAYS, THE WEEKS AND

1305
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
HOPEFULLY THE YEARS AHEAD.

1306
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
A VIGIL IN MAIN STREET HERE IN

1307
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
NEWTOWN.

1308
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A SHORT

1309
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
BREAK AND BE BACK IN A MOMENT.

1310
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
>>> THE SHOOTING IN NEWTOWN IS

1311
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
NOW IF SECOND DEADLIEST SCHOOL

1312
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
SHOOTING IN U.S. HISTORY BEHIND

1313
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
THE VIRGINIA TECH MASSACRE IN
2007.

1314
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
AFTER EVERY EVENT LIKE THIS, THE

1315
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
QUESTIONS ALWAYS ARE THE SAME,

1316
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
WHAT CAUSES THIS KIND OF A
SHOOTING?

1317
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN?

1318
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
HOW CAN THEY BE STOPPED?

1319
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I'M JOINED NOW BY KATHERINE

1320
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
NEWMAN FROM BALTIMORE WHO WROTE

1321
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
THE BOOK "RAMPAGE, THE SOCIAL

1322
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
ROOTS OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS" SHE'S

1323
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
STUDIED MANY OF THESE KINDS OF
EVENTS.

1324
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I'VE READ A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

1325
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
YOUR RESEARCH.

1326
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT

1327
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
THESE SHOOTINGS THAT ARE SORT OF

1328
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
COUNTERINTUITIVE?

1329
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
PEOPLE THINK THEY KNOW WHAT

1330
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
CAUSES THEM AT TIMES ABOUT THE

1331
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
COLUMBINE.

1332
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
BUT SO MANY OF THE THINGS WE

1333
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
THOUGHT WE KNEW ABOUT COLUMBINE

1334
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
HAVE TURNED OUT NOT TO BE TRUE.

1335
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
WHAT DO WE NOW KNOW ABOUT WHAT

1336
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
CAUSES THESE KINDS OF EVENTS?

1337
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
>> THAT'S SO TRUE.

1338
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
SOME OF THE COMMON MYTHS ARE

1339
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
THAT THESE THINGS ARE

1340
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
SPONTANEOUS.

1341
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
THEY'RE ALMOST NEVER

1342
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
SPONTANEOUS.

1343
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
SOME OF THE SHOOTINGS WE STUDIED

1344
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
WERE PLANNED OVER A NINE-MONTH

1345
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
PERIOD.

1346
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
SADLY IN MANY INSTANCES, THERE

1347
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
ARE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE

1348
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
AN INKLING.

1349
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
IN SOME OF THE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS

1350
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
WE STUDIED, THERE WERE CHILDREN

1351
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
WHO DIDN'T COME TO SCHOOL THAT

1352
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
DAY BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED

1353
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN

1354
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
BUT SADLY THEY NEVER TOLD ANYONE

1355
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
WHO COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING.

1356
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
AND SO ONE OF THE

1357
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
COUNTERINTUITIVE THINGS WE

1358
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
LEARNED WAS THAT THERE'S A LOT

1359
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
OF INFORMATION OFTEN CIRCULATING

1360
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
BUT IT DOESN'T GET TO THE RIGHT

1361
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
PLACE.

1362
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WAS TRUE IN

1363
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE.

1364
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
IT WILL TAKE TIME BEFORE WE KNOW

1365
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
ENOUGH TO GENERALIZE TO IT.

1366
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
BUT IN THE STUDIES WE STUDIED --

1367
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
AND WE STUDIED ALL OF THEM FROM

1368
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
THE 1970s ONWARD IN THE UNITED

1369
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
STATES, IT WAS FREQUENTLY THE

1370
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
CASE THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF

1371
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
KNOWLEDGE IN PEER COMMUNITIES

1372
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
THAT DIDN'T GET THROUGH TO THE

1373
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
ADULTS IN TIME TO DO ANYTHING

1374
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
ABOUT IT.

1375
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT IT

1376
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
FREQUENTLY HAPPENS IN TOWNS JUST

1377
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
LIKE NEWTOWN, SMALL, RURAL

1378
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
SETTIN, NOT THE PLACES THAT WE

1379
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
THINK OF AS CHARACTERISTICALLY

1380
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
VIOLENT.

1381
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
WE THINK OF BIG CITIES AS PLACES

1382
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
WHERE THERE'S GUN VIOLENCE.

1383
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
AND OF COURSE THERE IS.

1384
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
BUT THESE KINDS OF SHOOTINGS

1385
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
DON'T HAPPEN IN BIG CITIES.

1386
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
THEY HAPPEN USUALLY IN SMALL

1387
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
TOWNS OR SUBURBS.

1388
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
>> AND IS THERE A COMMON THREAD

1389
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
IN THE MENTAL HEALTH HISTORY OF

1390
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
THE BOYS INVOLVED IN THESE?

1391
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
>> THERE IS ALMOST ALWAYS A

1392
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION.

1393
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
THE SAD THING IS IT'S OFTEN

1394
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
UNRECOGNIZED AND UNTREATED.

1395
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
SO WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL BE

1396
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
TRUE IN THIS CASE.

1397
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
BUT IN MOST OF THE CASES WE

1398
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
LOOKED AT, THERE WAS

1399
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
AFTER-THE-FACT EVIDENCE OF

1400
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
MENTAL DISORDERS BUT NO
TREATMENT.

1401
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
THAT'S DISTURBING BECAUSE WE

1402
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
LIKE TO THINK WE CAN RECOGNIZE

1403
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
THE SYMPTOMS.

1404
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
BUT PARTICULARLY WHEN THE

1405
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
SHOOTERS ARE YOUNGER THAN THIS

1406
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
ONE, THE ONES WE LOOKED AT WERE

1407
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
13, 12, THE SIGNS OF

1408
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
DISTINGUISHED MENTAL ILLNESS

1409
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
THAT ARE GOING TO BE SO VIVID IF

1410
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
THEY SURVIVE INTO THEIR 20s ARE

1411
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
NOT SO EASY TO DISCERN WHEN

1412
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
THEY'RE 13.

1413
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
SO SADLY THERE IS A -- THERE'S

1414
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
EVIDENCE AFTER THE FACT OFTEN

1415
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
THAT COMES UP IN FORENSIC

1416
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
EXAMINATIONS, BUT NOT THE KIND
OF EVIDENCE THAT LEADS TO THE

1417
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
TREATMENT THAT THEY SO

1418
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
DESPERATELY NEED.

1419
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
>> IT'S ALSO INTERESTING IN THE

1420
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
BOOK TITLE, YOU TALK ABOUT THE

1421
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
SOCIAL ROOTS OF THESE SHOOTINGS.

1422
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
OFTENTIMES THE IDEAS THAT THESE

1423
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
ARE LONERS ON THE FRINGE.

1424
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
BUT YOU'VE FOUND IT'S NOT THAT

1425
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
SIMPLE.

1426
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
>> NO.

1427
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
SADLY THEY ARE RARELY LONERS.

1428
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
IT'S MORE CHARACTERISTIC TO SAY

1429
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
THEY'RE FAILED JOINERS.

1430
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

1431
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
TYPICALLY TRIED TO JOIN GROUPS

1432
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
AND ARE REBUFFED AND REJECTED.

1433
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
SO THEIR EXPERIENCE IS NOT THAT

1434
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
OF BEING A LONER.

1435
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
IT'S OF BEING PUSHED ASIDE AND

1436
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
MADE TO FEEL REJECTED.

1437
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
AND SO WHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS

1438
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
WITH THESE YOUNG MEN IS THAT

1439
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
THEY GO THROUGH A WHOLE SERIES

1440
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
OF EFFORTS TO TRY AND GET

1441
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
ATTENTION AND INGRATIATE

1442
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
THEMSELVES IN GROUPS.

1443
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
ALL THOSE EFFORTS FAIL AND THEY

1444
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
START TALKING ABOUT SHOOTING

1445
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
PEOPLE AND SUDDENLY EVERYONE'S

1446
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
PAYING ATTENTION.

1447
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
SO THEY'RE TRYING TO CHANGE HOW

1448
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THEM AND

1449
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
NOTORIOUS AND EVIL SEEMS BETTER

1450
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
TO THEM THAN A LOSER.

1451
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
>> IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I

1452
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
BELIEVE JUST IN NOT TRYING TO

1453
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
MENTION THEIR NAMES BECAUSE JUST

1454
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY CAN

1455
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN GAME FAME

1456
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
OR NOTORIETY BY DOING THIS, I

1457
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
JUST DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD TO

1458
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
PERPETUATE THAT.

1459
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I KIND YOUR RESEARCH REALLY

1460
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
FASCINATING.

1461
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'D LOOV TO TALK TO YOU MORE IN

1462
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
THE DAYS AHEAD.

1463
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.

1464
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
>> MY PLEASURE, ANDERSON.

1465
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
>> SOME MEMORIES ARE SEARED INTO

1466
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
OUR MINDS NO MATTER HOW MUCH ONE

1467
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
WANTS TO FORGET THEM.

1468
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
THE NEWTOWN SHOOTING NO DOUBT

1469
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY FOR ONE

1470
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
OF THE SCHOOL'S TEACHERS.

1471
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
YET IN THE MIDST OF A CRISIS,

1472
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
SHE STAYED REMARKABLY CALM FOR

1473
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
HER KINDERGARTEN STUDENTS.

1474
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I TALKED TO HER, JANET VOLLMER

1475
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
IS HER NAME.

1476
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I WANT YOU TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAID

1477
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
ABOUT HOW SHE GOT HERSELF

1478
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
THROUGH THIS CRISIS.

1479
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
LISTEN.

1480
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
>> ABOUT 9:30, 9:40, WE HEARD

1481
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
NOISES.

1482
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM WAS

1483
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
STILL ON.

1484
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
SO IT DIDN'T GO OFF.

1485
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
SO YOU COULD HEAR WHAT SOUNDED

1486
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
LIKE POPS, GUNSHOTS.

1487
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
OF COURSE I'M NOT GOING TO TELL

1488
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
THAT TO 5-YEAR-OLDS.

1489
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
SO I SAID TO THEM, WE'RE GOING

1490
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
OVER IN A SAFE AREA AND WE'RE

1491
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
GOING TO -- WE READ A STORY AND

1492
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
WE KEPT THEM CALM.

1493
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
DID A LOCKDOWN DRILL, CLOSED THE

1494
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
DOORS, LOCKED -- COVERED THE
WINDOWS.

1495
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
KEPT THE CHILDREN WITH US.

1496
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I HAVE OTHER ADULTS --
>> I FIND THAT AMAZING THAT

1497
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
FEARING THAT YOU HEAR GUNSHOTS,

1498
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
YOU WERE ABLE TO HAVE THE

1499
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
COMPOSURE TO SIT DOWN AND READ

1500
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
TO YOUR STUDENTS.
THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.

1501
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
WITH 5-YEAR-OLDS BECAUSE YOU

1502
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
CAN'T LOSE IT.

1503
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG

1504
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
TIME.
IT'S MY 18th YEAR OF TEACHING.

1505
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
MY JOB WAS TO KEEP THEM SAFE.

1506
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I DIDN'T KNOW -- THERE WAS NO

1507
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
ANNOUNCEMENT OF WHAT WAS GOING

1508
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
ON.

1509
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
MY INSTINCT WAS IT WASN'T GOOD.

1510
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
SO WE KEPT THEM CALM.

1511
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
WE STAYED IN THE ROOM UNTIL

1512
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
THERE WAS BANGING AT THE DOOR,

1513
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
WHICH WERE THE POLICE AND THE

1514
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
TROOPERS OR WHOEVER WAS THERE.

1515
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
THEY HAD US EXIT THE BUILDING.

1516
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
THEY TOLD THE CHILDREN TO COVER

1517
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
THEIR EYES AND WALK IN A LINE

1518
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
AND LEAVE THE BUILDING AND

1519
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
THAT'S WHEN WE WENT DOWN TOWARDS
THE FIREHOUSE.

1520
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
WE WERE ALL SAFE.

1521
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I HAD 19 CHILDREN IN THE ROOM

1522
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
WITH ME AND THANK GOODNESS ALL

1523
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
OF THEIR PARENTS WERE ABLE TO

1524
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
COME AND PICK THEM UP AND TAKE

1525
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
THEM HOME.

1526
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
>> AS YOU WERE READING TO THEM,

1527
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
DID THE KIDS REALIZE SOMETHING

1528
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
WAS GOING ON OR DID THEY JUST

1529
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
THINK IT WAS A DRILL LIKE YOU'D
HAD BEFORE?

1530
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
>> RIGHT.

1531
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
IT DIDN'T SEEM A NATURAL THING.

1532
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
ALTHOUGH WE DO PRACTICE DRILLS.

1533
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
WE JUST SAID, WELL, WE'RE NOT

1534
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
REALLY SURE BUT WE'RE GOING TO

1535
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
BE SAFE BECAUSE WE'RE SITTING

1536
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
OVER HERE AND WE'RE ALL

1537
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
TOGETHER.

1538
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
AND THAT'S AS WE GOT DOWN TO THE

1539
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
FIREHOUSE LATER ON, AS A LOT OF

1540
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
THE EVENTS STARTED TO UNFOLD

1541
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY, I THINK SOME

1542
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
OF THEM REALIZED THE MAGNITUDE

1543
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.

1544
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
THEY SAW OTHER PEOPLE UPSET.

1545
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
BUT WE JUST HELD THEM CLOSE

1546
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
UNTIL THEIR PARENTS CAME AND WE

1547
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
RELEASED THEM.

1548
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
MY ROOM, MY CHILDREN WERE ALL

1549
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
ACCOUNTED FOR AND SAFE IN MY

1550
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
KIRPD GARTIN CLASSROOM.

1551
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
>> WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE

1552
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
KIDS DEALING WITH THE POTENTIAL

1553
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
FOR PTSD.

1554
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
ALSO FIRST RESPONDERS DEALING

1555
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
WITH THE STRESS IN ALL OF THIS

1556
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
AND WHAT THEY'VE HAD TO SEE.

1557
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
TERRY LYLES DEALS WITH STRESS

1558
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT.

1559
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
HE JOINS ME FROM MIAMI.

1560
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
IT IS EASY TO FORGET THESE

1561
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
SCENES ARE PROBABLY THE WORST

1562
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
MANY OF THESE EMERGENCY WORKERS

1563
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
HAVE EVER WITNESSED.

1564
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE THINGS THEY

1565
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
SAW IN THOSE SCHOOLS -- IN THAT

1566
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
SCHOOL.

1567
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
YOU HELP RESCUE WORKERS DEAL
WITH TRAGEDY FOLLOWING THE

1568
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
SEPTEMBER 11th ATTACKS.

1569
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE?

1570
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
HOW DO YOU HELP THEM?

1571
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
>> WELL, ANDERSON, THANK YOU FOR

1572
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
HAVING ME.

1573
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I THINK THE BIGGEST THING THAT

1574
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE

1575
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
CLOSEST YOU ARE TO THE

1576
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
EPICENTER, HEARING THE SHOTS,

1577
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
SEEING THE VIOLENCE VISUALLY,

1578
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
THE MORE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO

1579
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
BE ABLE TO DEBRIEF.

1580
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
AS I DEBRIEF SPECIAL FORCES

1581
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
PEOPLE AND SOLDIERS, IT'S VERY

1582
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
IMPORTANT THAT THESE CHILDREN,

1583
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
THEIR PARENTS UNDERSTAND THAT

1584
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
THERE'S LIFE AFTER TRAGEDY BUT

1585
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEIR

1586
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
STORIES, WE HAVE TO HELP THEM

1587
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
VENT AND RELEASE THAT

1588
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN

1589
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
NORMALIZE AND GO BACK TO SOME

1590
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
TYPE OF LIFE AS THEY KNEW IT

1591
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
BEFORE THIS TRAGIC DAY.

1592
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
>> WHAT KIND OF SYMPTOMS DO

1593
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
PARENTS, DO FRIENDS OF PEOPLE

1594
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR?

1595
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
>> WELL, TYPICALLY WITH

1596
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
CHILDREN, IT'S ALL AGE

1597
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
APPROPRIATENESS.

1598
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
SO IT REALLY DEPENDS.

1599
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
BUT USUALLY SLEEP CAN BE

1600
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
DISRUPTED.

1601
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
THERE CAN BE NIGHTMARES.

1602
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
THERE COULD BE SUDDEN NOISES

1603
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
THAT COULD STARTLE THEM.

1604
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
MOODINESS THAT YOU'VE NOT SEEN

1605
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
BEFORE, MAYBE A LOSS IN APPETITE

1606
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
OR A LOSS OF INTEREST IN NORMAL

1607
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
THINGS.

1608
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
AND I THINK FOR PARENTS MAINLY,

1609
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
WE'RE ALL JUST MORTIFIED BY THIS

1610
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
EVENT.

1611
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
AND I THINK AS PARENTS WE HAVE

1612
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LKING

1613
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
TO OUR CHILDREN, REGARDLESS OF

1614
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
WHERE WE ARE IN THE COUNTRY OR

1615
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
AROUND THE WORLD, THAT WE CAN

1616
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
LET OUR CHILDREN KNOW AND

1617
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
SUPPORT THEM TO SAY, LISTEN,

1618
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
IT'S OKAY, THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN

1619
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

1620
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
THIS WAS NOT A NORMAL SITUATION

1621
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
AND WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THEM AND

1622
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
CARE FOR THEM THAT THEY KNOW

1623
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
THAT THEY'RE SECURED IN A NORMAL

1624
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN.

1625
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
>> BUT TALKING ABOUT IT HELPS?

1626
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
>> WELL, AGAIN, IT DEPENDS ON

1627
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
THE AGE.

1628
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
THE AGES OF THE KIDS THAT YOU

1629
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
MENTIONED, I AGREE WITH YOU.

1630
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

1631
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
BE ABLE TO EVEN NAME THE NAMES

1632
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
AND THE AGES OF THESE CHILDREN.

1633
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
IT'S HEARTBREAKING.

1634
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
AND I THINK WHAT HE CAN DO, AS

1635
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
WE TALK TO OUR CHILDREN, IF

1636
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
CHILDREN CAN DRAW PICTURES AND

1637
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
WRITE LETTERS IF THAT'S WHAT IT

1638
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
GOES, TO FRIENDS THAT THEY LOST

1639
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
OR THE SITUATIONS THEY HEARD AND

1640
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
DESTROY THOSE LETTERS.

1641
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
WE DESTROY EVERYTHING THAT IS OF

1642
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
WASTE TO US.

1643
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
WE PUT GARBAGE BAGS OUT.

1644
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
WE FLUSH GARBAGE DISPOSALS.

1645
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
