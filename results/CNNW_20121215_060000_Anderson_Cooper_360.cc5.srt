00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
TIME THAT AMERICAN PLIXS DID

WE DON'T WANT HISTORY TO

THOSE WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN SO

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
UNFAIRLY TAKEN.

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
STILL AN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE.

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
THAT MEANS THAT MANY OF THE

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000

SHE WAS FOUND DEAD AT THE FAMILY

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000

IT'S UNCLEAR HOW SHE DIED OR

66
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000

IT MIGHT BE AS SOON AS TOMORROW

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, KNOWING THAT

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
YOUR CHILD HAS PERISHED INSIDE

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
OF THAT SCHOOL AND YOU CAN'T

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
EVEN GO AND GET A BODY.

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
IT WOULD BE A HORRIFIC THING.

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
CONNECTICUT THAT CANNOT DO THAT

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
TONIGHT.
AND THEY NEED ALL OF US RIGHT

189
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
NOW.

190
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
>> WE WILL BRING YOU ALL OF

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S COMMENTS LATER

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
ON IN THIS HOUR AHEAD.

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
AS ONE MOTHER SAID TOO MANY OF

194
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
OUR BABIES DIECHLTD WITH US ON

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
THE PHONE FROM NEWTOWN IS JANET

196
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
VOLMEI

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
VOLMER WHO TEACHES KINDERGARTEN

198
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THERE.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

199
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
>> I'M OKAY.

200
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
MY FAMILY IS HERE, AND THAT

201
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
HELPS.

202
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
MY HUSBAND CAME AND MY DOGS AND

203
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
SONS.
>> YOU WERE IN YOUR CLASSROOM.

204
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
>> I WAS IN MY CLASSROOM.

205
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
>> YOU WERE IN YOUR CLASSROOM.

206
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

207
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
>> WELL, ABOUT 9:30, 9:40, WE

208
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
HEARD NOISES AND THE

209
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM WAS STILL

210
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
ON.

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
SO IT DIDN'T GO OFF.

212
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
SO YOU COULD HEAR WHAT SOUNDED

213
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
LIKE POPS, GUNSHOTS.

214
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
OF COURSE I'M NOT GOING TO TELL

215
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
THAT TO 5-YEAR-OLDS.

216
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
SO I SAID WE ARE GOING TO A SAFE

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
AREA AND WE READ A STORY AND

218
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
KEPT THEM CALM.

219
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
DID A LOCKDOWN DRILL.

220
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
CLOSED THE DOORS, COVERED THE

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
WINDOWS AND KEPT THE CHILDREN

222
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
WITH US.

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I HAVE OTHER ADULTS.

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
>> I FIND THAT AMAZING THAT

225
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
FEARING THAT YOU HEAR GUNSHOTS

226
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
YOU WERE ABLE TO HAVE THE

227
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
COMPOSURE TO SIT DOWN AND READ

228
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
TO YOUR STUDENTS.

229
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.

230
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
WITH 5-YEAR-OLDS BECAUSE YOU

232
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
CAN'T LOSE IT.

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
YOU JUST -- I HAVE BEEN DOING

234
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
THIS A LONG TIME.

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
IT IS MY 18th YEAR OF TEACHING.

236
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I DIDN'T KNOW.
THERE WAS NO ANNOUNCEMENT OF

237
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

238
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
MY INSTINCT WAS IT WASN'T GOOD.

239
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
SO WE KEPT THEM CALM.

240
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
WE STAYED IN THE ROOM UNTIL

241
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
THERE WAS BANGING AT THE DOOR,

242
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
WHICH WERE THE POLICE AND THE

243
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
TROOPERS OR WHOEVER WAS THERE

244
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
AND THEY HAD US EXIT THE

245
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
BUILDING AND TOLD THE CHILDREN

246
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
TO COVER THEIR EYES AND WALK IN

247
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
A LINE AND LEAVE THE BUILDING

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
AND THAT'S WHEN WE WENT TO THE

249
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
FIRE HOUSE.

250
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
WE WERE ALL SAFE.

251
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I HAD 19 CHILDREN IN THE ROOM

252
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
WITH ME AND THANK GOODNESS ALL

253
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
OF THEIR PARENTS WERE ABLE TO

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
COME AND PICK THEM UP AND TAKE

255
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
THEM HOME.

256
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
>> AS YOU WERE READING TO THEM,

257
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
DID THE KIDS REALIZE SOMETHING

258
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
WAS GOING ON OR DID THEY THINK

259
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
IT WAS A DRILL LIKE BEFORE?

260
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
>> IT DIDN'T SEEM A NATURAL

261
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
THING, ALTHOUGH WE DO PRACTICE

262
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
DRILLS.

263
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
WE JUST SAID, WE'RE NOT REALLY

264
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
SURE, BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE SAFE

265
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
BECAUSE WE ARE SITTING OVER HERE

266
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
AN WE ARE ALL TOGETHER.

267
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
AND THAT'S -- AS WE GOT TO THE

268
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
FIRE HOUSE LATER ON, AS A LOT OF

269
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
THE EVENTS BEGAN TO UNFOLD

270
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY I THINK SOME

271
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
OF THEM REALIZED THE MAGNITUDE

272
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.

273
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
THEY SAW OTHER PEOPLE UPSET.

274
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
WE HELD THEM CLOSE UNTIL THEIR

275
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
PARENTS CAME AND WE RELEASED

276
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
THEM AN MY ROOM, MY CHILDREN

277
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
WERE ALL ACCOUNTED FOR AND SAFE

278
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
IN MY KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM.

279
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
>> IT'S SO, FOR ALL OF US IT IS

280
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
SO INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND

281
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNEW THE CHILDREN

282
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
AND THE FAMILIES INVOLVED.

283
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE LOST THEIR

284
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
LIVES.
I'M NOT GOING TO CERTAINLY ASK

285
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
ABOUT THE KIDS BUT WHAT DO YOU

286
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
WANT THE RLD TO KNOW ABOUT

287
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
YOUR COLLEAGUES.

288
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
>> WE HEARD A LOT OF THINGS AT

289
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
THE FIRE HOUSE.

290
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
PEOPLE WERE TEXTING NEWS REPORTS

291
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
AND THIS ONE AND THAT ONE.

292
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'M SURE -- I'M NOT SURE STILL

293
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
OF THE MAGNITUDE OF WHO EVERYONE

294
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
IS BECAUSE I HEAR SIX OR SEVEN

295
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
ADULTS AND MANY CHILDREN, AND I

296
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
KNOW THOSE FIRST GRADERS WERE

297
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
CHILDREN I HAD IN MY ROOM LAST

298
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
YEAR.

299
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
SO THOSE PARENTS WERE SHOWING UP

300
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
TODAY AND THEY COULDN'T FIND

301
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
THEIR CHILDREN AND THEY WERE ALL

302
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
TAKEN TO SEPARATE ROOMS.

303
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
SO, I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE

304
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
BUT I'M SURE AS THE DAYS UNFOLD

305
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
IT WILL NOT BE GOOD NEWS FOR

306
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE.

307
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
>> IT'S REALLY BEYOND WORDS.

308
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
AND I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING A

309
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
MOMENT TO TALK TO US TONIGHT.

310
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
REALLY IS.

311
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
JANET, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

312
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
COMPOSURE.
IT IS EXTRAORDINARY WHAT YOU DID

313
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
AND THE OTHER COLLEAGUES OF

314
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
YOURS.

315
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
>> SOME OF THOSE TEACHERS WERE

316
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
HEROS.

317
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
SOME OF THEM IN THE FRONT

318
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
BUILDING.
WE HAD ONE TEACHER WHO WAS ON

319
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
THE NEWS EARLIER.

320
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
SHE LOCKED EVERYBODY IN THE

321
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
BATHROOM AND WOULDN'T OPEN THE

322
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
DOOR.
WE DO THIS AS TEACHERS.

323
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
WE ARE TRAINED.

324
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
WE DO HAVE DRILLS.

325
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
WE TALK TO THE KIDS IN CASE

326
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN.

327
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THIS IS WHAT WE DO AND THAT IS

328
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

329
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
EVERYBODY JUST INSTINCTIVELY

330
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
KEPT THEIR CHILDREN SAFE.

331
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
>> THERE'S A LOT OF TEACHERS

332
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT I THINK

333
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
OF AS HEROS EVERY DAY AND TODAY

334
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
FRANKLY YOU SHOWED THAT AND ALL

335
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
OF YOUR COLLEAGUES SHOWED THAT.

336
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
SO THANK YOU.

337
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
>> I WISH YOU PEACE AND STRENGTH

338
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
IN THE DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD.

339
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
AMY SEAVER IS JOINING US ON THE

340
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
PHONE.
HER DAUGHTER IS A FIRST GRADER

341
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
AT SANDY HOOK.

342
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
SHE AND OTHER PARENTS GOT THE

343
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
CHILLING PHONE CALL SAYING THE

344
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
SCHOOL WAS ON LOCKDOWN.

345
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
HOW IS YOUR DAUGHTER DOING, YOUR

346
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
FAMILY.
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

347
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
>> OKAY.

348
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
IT'S A VERY ROUGH NIGHT HERE

349
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
WHEN YOUR FIRST GRADER GOES TO

350
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
BED AND SAYS, MOMMY, IS ANYONE

351
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
FROM MY LAST YEAR ARE THEY ALL

352
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
OKAY?
ARE THEY ALL OKAY AND YOU LOOK

353
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
AT THEM AND SAY I'M NOT REALLY

354
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
SURE.

355
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
IT IS A ROUGH NIGHT TO TELL THAT

356
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
TO YOUR 7-YEAR-OLD.

357
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
IT'S VERY, SAD NIGHT FOR THIS

358
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
TOWN AND A LOT OF FAMILIES HERE.

359
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
>> HAS YOUR DAUGHTER WANTED TO

360
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OR

361
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
FIRST GRADE -- DO THEY WANT TO

362
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
TALK?
>> SHE ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS

363
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL.

364
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
SHE GOT WIND QUICKLY THAT

365
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE

366
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
PRINCIPAL.
WHICH WE DIDN'T TELL HER UNTIL

367
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
JUST NOW THAT YES, SHE WAS

368
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
DEFINITELY HURT AND IT WASN'T

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
GOOD.
IT'S TAKING HER A WHILE.

370
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I THINK TOMORROW WILL BE

371
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
PROBABLY HARDER FOR HER.

372
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I ALSO HAVE A FIFTH GRADER WHO

373
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
CAME OFF THE BUS CRY CANNING

374
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
BECAUSE SHE HAD A SISTER WHO SHE

375
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
WAS WORRIED ABOUT.

376
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
JUST BASICALLY LEFT THAT SCHOOL

377
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

378
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I THINK FOR A LOT OF THOSE KIDS

379
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
THEY ARE KIND OF OLDER AND CAN

380
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
GET IT A LITTLE FASTER, EVEN

381
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
THOUGH THEY WEREN'T IN IT.

382
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
SO THE QUESTIONS I THINK ARE

383
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
COMING.
THEY ARE NOT REALLY HERE YET,

384
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
ESPECIALLY FOR THE LITTLER ONES.

385
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
IT STARTED TONIGHT AS I PUT THEM

386
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
TO BED.
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW YOU WILL

387
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS.

388
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
A LOT OF PARENTS AROUND THE

389
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
WORLD WHOSE CHILDREN WILL BE

390
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
ASKING THEM QUESTIONS.

391
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT YOU

392
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
WILL SAY?

393
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
>> UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE BEEN

394
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
THROUGH A BIT OF TRAUMA IN OUR

395
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
OWN LIFE.
FOR ME AND I CAN'T SPEAK FOR

396
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
OTHER MOMS OR MOMS AROUND THE

397
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
WORLD BUT FOR MY FAMILY, I SPEAK

398
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
QUIETLY AND TRUTHFULLY.

399
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
AND I TRY TO ANSWER THE

400
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
QUESTIONS THAT ARE ASKED AND

401
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
GIVE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY

402
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
ASK FOR WITHOUT A LOT OF DETAIL.

403
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I DEFINITELY DON'T LIE.

404
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I WAS POINT BLANK ASKED TONIGHT

405
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
IF THE PRINCIPAL WAS OKAY AND I

406
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
SAID NO AND SHE ASKED IF SHE WAS

407
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
DEAD AND I SAID YES.

408
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I DON'T LIE TO MY CHILDREN.

409
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I TRY NOT TO OFFER TOO MUCH

410
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY

411
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
KNOW.
SO I TRY TO SIT BACK AND WAIT

412
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
FOR THEM TO ASK BUT IF THEY ASK

413
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
ME A QUESTION I GIVE THEM AN

414
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
HONEST ANSWER.

415
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
UNFORTUNATELY FOR A LOT OF US IN

416
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
TOWN, THE ANSWERS ARE NOT GOOD.

417
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
>> THE PRINCIPAL --

418
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
>> OUR HEARTS ARE SAD TONIGHT.
I DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE CAN

419
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS EASILY.

420
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
THEY ARE DEFINITELY NOT FUN

421
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
ANSWERS.
>> I'VE HEARD SO MANY GREAT

422
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
THINGS ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL, DAWN

423
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
HOCHSPRUNG

424
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
AND THE FACT THAT YOUR CHILD WAS

425
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
ACTING ABOUT HER.

426
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW

427
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
ABOUT DAWN?

428
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
>> VERY LOVELY, COMPASSIONATE

429
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
WOMAN.

430
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
EXTREMELY HELPFUL, AS A CHIR ON

431
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
ONE OF THE PTA COMMITTEES COULD

432
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
NOT HAVE COME OUT TO SUPPORT ME

433
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
BETTER THIS YEAR.

434
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I NEEDED SUPPORT THIS YEAR AND

435
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE ON MY

436
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
TEAM, THE FIRST ONE TO HELP.

437
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
THE FIRST ONE TO BE THERE.

438
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
NEVER SAW HER WITHOUT A SMILE.

439
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
YOU KNOW, JUST IN MY DAUGHTER'S

440
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
CLASSROOM THIS WEEK READING A

441
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
BOOK TO THE KIDS.

442
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
VERY, VERY LOVELY.

443
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
VERY LOVELY WOMAN AND DEFINITELY

444
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
HAD THE CHILDREN, I BELIEVE HAD

445
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
THE CHILDREN'S BEST INTENTIONS

446
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
ALL THE TIME.

447
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
SHE WAS ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR

448
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
THEM.

449
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
VERY SAD DAY.

450
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
>> YEAH.

451
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED AND I'M

452
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
GOING TO LET YOU GO.

453
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I APPRECIATE YOU TALKING

>> THANK YOU.

469
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
>> THAT IS FRANKLY UNBELIEVABLE.

470
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
LET'S GO TO SOL DAD.

471
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
-- SOLEDAD.

472
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
>> IT REALLY IS.
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO

473
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
FATHOM WHAT THE PEOPLE OF

474
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
NEWTOWN ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT

475
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
NOW AND SO MANY LIVES WERE LOST.

476
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES

477
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
WERE CHANGED FOREVER.

478
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND EVEN

479
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
IN SOME CASES STRANGERS GATHERED

480
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
AND CONTINUE TO GATHER AT THIS

481
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
HOUR TO HOLD EACH OTHER AND CRY

482
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
AND TO REMEMBER.

483
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
THERE WAS A VIGIL TONIGHT.

484
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
TOOK PLACE AT A LOCAL CHURCH.

485
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
JASON HAS BEEN THERE ALL DAY AND

486
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
THROUGH THE NIGHT AND HE HAS AN

487
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
UPDATE ON HOW THAT WENT.

488
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
JASON, THE MOOD HAS TO BE SO

489
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
SAD.
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

490
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
TONIGHT'S VIGIL.

491
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
>> YOU KNOW, I HAVE SEEN A LOT

492
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
OF EMOTIONAL THINGS THROUGHOUT

493
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
MY LIFE.

494
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
TONIGHT WAS -- IT'S REALLY HARD

495
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
TO EXPLAIN.

496
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
THE VIGIL HERE TONIGHT, SO MANY

497
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
PEOPLE CAME OUT HERE SOLEDAD.

498
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH ROOM FOR

499
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
EVERYONE.
THEY STOOD OUTSIDE IN THE

500
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
FREEZING COLD.
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE STOOD IN

501
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
SILENCE AND LISTENED.

502
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
WHEN THE VIGIL LED OUT, ALL OF

503
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
THOSE STANDING OUTSIDE WENT

504
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
INSIDE AND YOU HEARD SOME

505
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
SINGING AT ONE POINT.

506
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
GROUPS BROKE OFF IN TO SEPARATE

507
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
GROUPS AND STARTED SINGING.

508
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
PEOPLE CAME HERE TONIGHT AND I

509
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
KNOW YOU HEARD ANDERSON GIVE THE

510
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
EMOTIONAL INTERVIEW.

511
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
PEOPLE CAME LOOKING FOR ANSWERS

512
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
LIKE THAT MOTHER WAS TRYING TO

513
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
GIVE ANSWERS TO HER DAUGHTER.

514
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
IT'S DIFFICULT.

515
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
IT'S VERY TOUGH TO DRY TRY TO

516
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
GET THOSE ANSWERS AT THIS TIME.

517
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
PEOPLE CAME HERE LOOKING FOR

518
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
THAT.
THEY CAME HERE TO LEAN ON EACH

519
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
OTHER AND THEY TURNED TO THEIR

520
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
FAITH.

521
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
THIS IS THE KIND OF PLACE WHERE

522
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
SO MANY PEOPLE THAT CAME OUT

523
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
HERE TONIGHT KNEW SOMEONE.

524
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
THEY KNEW ONE OF THE FACULTY

525
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
MEMBERS, KNEW THE CHILDREN.

526
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
TOLD A STORY ABOUT A LITTLE GIRL

527
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
WHO LOST HER LIFE WHO WAS

528
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
SUPPOSED TO BE AT A CHRISTMAS

529
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
PAGEANT AND ANOTHER MAN WHO KNEW

530
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
THE PRINCIPAL AND SPOKE ABOUT

531
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
HER.
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO A LITTLE

532
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
BIT OF THAT CONVERSATION.

533
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
>> DAWN, THE PRINCIPAL AT SANDY

534
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
HOOK, I HAD DINNER WITH HER LAST

535
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
SPRING.
SHE WAS EXCITING, KBUB BRANT AND

536
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
INCREDIBLE EDUCATOR AND TO LOSE

537
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
SOMEBODY LIKE THAT IN THE

538
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
DISTRICT IS SAD BECAUSE THEY

539
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
LOST A LEADER TODAY AT SANDY

540
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
HOOK BUT THE PRAYERS ARE FOR OUR

541
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
COMMUNITY, AS WELL.

542
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
>> ONE OF THE OTHER POINTS HE

543
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
WANTED TO MAKE IS THIS WAS A

544
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
WOMAN WHO LOVED NOT ONLY HER

545
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
SCHOOL CAN AND HER JOB BUT ALL

546
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
OF THE CHILDREN AT THE SCHOOL,

547
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
AS WELL.

548
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
SOLEDAD.

549
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
>> I KNOW AUD CHANCE TO TALK TO

550
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
THE DEACON AND I'M SURE HE WILL

551
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
BE THE FOCUS OF MANY OF THE

552
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
QUESTIONS PEOPLE ARE HAVING.

553
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

554

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
BECAME EMOTIONAL DURING OUR

556
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
CONVERSATION.
HE SAID AT LEAST A HUNDRED

557
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
PEOPLE CAME THROUGH THE CHURCH

558
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS AN

560
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I ASKED HOW DO YOU PROVIDE

561
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
ANSWERS AND HE SAID IT IS TOO

562
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
SOON TO COME UP WITH A DEEP

563
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
PHILOSOPHICAL ANSWER OF WHY THIS

564
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
HAPPENED.
HE WAS FEELING THE EMOTION OF

565
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
WHAT HAPPENED AS WELL.

566
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
HE KNEW SOME OF THE CHILDREN

567
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
THAT WERE KILLED, INCLUDING SOME

568
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000

569
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
HE SPOKE ABOUT ONE CHILD IN

570
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
PARTICULAR.
HE REMEMBERED RECEIVING HER

571
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
FIRST COMMUNION HERE AT THE

572
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000

573
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
IMPRESSION ON HIM AND HE

574
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
EXPLAINS THE REASON WHY.

575
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
>> I HEARD ONE OF THE VICTIMS,

576
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT IT, BUT I

577
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
HEARD ONE OF THE VICTIMS

578
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
RECENTLY.
IT WAS BIRTHDAY MONEY.

579
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
SHE GATHERED UP HER BIRTHDAY

580
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
SO THAT'S -- THAT MAKES IT VERY,

585
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
VERY PERSONAL.

586
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
AND VERY INTIMATE.

587
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
>> HIS STRUGGLE IS THAT HE HAS

588
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
TO BE A ROCK FOR THE COMMUNITY

589
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000

HE HAS TO TRY TO KEEP IT

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
TOGETHER AS MORE PEOPLE COME TO

I SAID WHAT DO YOU DO?

594
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
HE SAID I'M GOING TO GO HOME AND

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
HUG MY OWN DAUGHTER AND COME

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000

I DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE IS

607
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
CLOSE TO UNDERSTANDING AT THIS

608
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
HORROR.

739
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
20 CHILDREN, SEVEN ADULTS.

740
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
LAST NIGHT THEY WERE ALIVE

741
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
GETTING READY FOR ANOTHER DAY OF

742
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
SCHOOL.
AND TONIGHT THEY ARE GONE.

743
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE TO THE

744
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
NATION EARLIER.

745
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
WE PLAYED SOME OF IT BEFORE THE

746
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
TOP OF THE PROGRAM, BUT I THINK

747
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
IT IS WORTH HEARING ALL OF WHAT

748
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
HE SAID.
>> THIS AFTERNOON I SPOKE WITH

749
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
GOVERNOR MALLOY AND FBI DIRECTOR

750
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
MUELLER.
I OFFERED GOVERNOR MALLOY MY

751
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
CONDOLENCES ON BEHALF OF THE

752
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
NATION AND MADE IT CLEAR HE WILL

753
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
HAVE EVERY SINGLE RESOURCE HE

754
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THIS

755
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
HEINOUS CRIME, CARE FOR THE

756
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
VICTIMS, COUNSEL THEIR FAMILIES.

757
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
WE'VE ENDURED TOO MANY OF THESE

758
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST FEW YEARS

759
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
AND EACH TIME I LEARN THE NEWS,

760
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I REACT NOT AS A PRESIDENT BUT

761
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
AS ANYONE ELSE WOULD, AS A

762
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
PARENT.

763
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
AND THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE

764
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
TODAY.

765
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I KNOW THERE'S NOT A PARENT IN

766
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

767
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I

768
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
DO.

769
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

770
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

771
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

772
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

773
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

774
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

775
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

776
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
WEDDINGS, CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN.

777
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO
TEACHERS.

778
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
MEN AND WOMEN WHO DEVOTED THEIR

779
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
LIVES TO HELPING OUR CHILDREN
FULFILL THEIR DREAMS.

780
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY FOR

781
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
THE PARENTS, GRAND PARENT S,

782
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
SISTERS AND BROTHERS OF THESE

783
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
LITTLE CHILDREN AND FOR THE

784
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
FAMILIES OF THE ADULTS WHO WERE

785
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
LOST.

786
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

787
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
PARENTS OF THE SURVIVORS AS

788
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
WELL.

789
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
FOR AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE TO
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

790
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
TONIGHT, THEY KNOW THAT THEIR

791
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN

792
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY

793
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
AND THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT WILL

794
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
EASE THEIR PAIN.

795
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
AS A COUNTRY, WE HAVE BEEN

796
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
THROUGH THIS TOO MANY TIMES.
WHETHER IT'S AN ELEMENTARY

797
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN OR A SHOPPING

798
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
MALL IN OREGON.

799
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
OR A TEMPLE IN WISCONSIN OR A

800
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
MOVIE THEATER IN AURORA OR A

801
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
STREET CORNER IN CHICAGO.

802
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE OUR

803
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
NEIGHBORHOODS.

804
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
THESE CHILDREN ARE OUR CHILDREN.

805
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
WE WILL HAVE TO COMING TO AND

806
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION TO

807
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES LIKE

808
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
REGARDLESS OF THE POLITICS.

809
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
THIS EVENING MICHELLE AND I WILL

810
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
DO WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT IN

811
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
AMERICA WILL DO WHICH IS HUG OUR

812
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
CHILDREN A LITTLE TIGHTER AND

813
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
WILL TELL THEM WE LOVE THEM.

814
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
AND WE WILL REMIND EACH OTHER

815
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
HOW DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

816
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

817
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
CONNECTICUT THAT CANNOT DO THAT

818
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
TONIGHT.
AN THEY NEED ALL OF US RIGHT

819
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
NOW.
IN HARD DAYS TO COME, THE

820
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
COMMUNITY NEEDS US TO BE AT OUR

821
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
BEST AS AMERICANS, AND I WILL DO

822
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER, AS

823
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
PRESIDENT, TO HELP.

824
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
WHILE NOTHING CAN FILL THE SPACE

825
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
OF A LOST CHILD OR LOVED ONE,

826
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
ALL OF US CAN EXTEND A HAND TO

827
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
THOSE IN NEED TO REMIND THEM

828
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
THAT WE ARE THERE FOR THEM.

829
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
THAT WE ARE PRAYING FOR THEM,

830
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
THAT THE LOVE THEY FELT FOR

831
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
THOSE THEY LOST ENDURES NOT JUST

832
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
IN THEIR MEMORIES BUT ALSO IN
OURS.

833
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF THE

834
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
VICTIMS.
AND IN THE WORDS OF SCRIPTURE,

835
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
HEAL THE BROKEN HEARTED AND BIND

836
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
UP THEIR WOUNDS.

837
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SPEAKING

838
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
EARLIER TODAY, NOT JUST AS

839
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
PRESIDENT BUT AS A FATHER OF TWO

840
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
DAUGHTERS.
DENISE'S DAUGHTER GOES TO SANDY

841
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
HOOK.
SHE WAS IN SCHOOL THIS MORNING.

842
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
WE SPOKE EARLIER TONIGHT.

843
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
>> DENISE, I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT

844
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
THIS DAY HAS BEEN LIKE FOR YOU,

845
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
OBVIOUSLY FOR YOUR CHILD.

846
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
HOW IS YOUR CHILD AND HOW ARE

847
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
YOU DOING?

848
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
>> I THINK EVERYONE'S COPING AS

849
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
BEST AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.

850
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
IT'S SHOCKING WHEN IT HAPPENS

851
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
ANYWHERE.

852
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
WE'RE ALL TRYING TO WRAP OUR

853
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
ARMS AROUND THE SITUATION AS

854
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
BEST AS WE CAN.

855
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
>> DOES YOUR DAUGHTER WANT TO

856
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
TALK ABOUT IT WITH YOU OR ARE

857
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
YOU ENCOURAGING HER TO OR HOW
ARE YOU HANDLING THIS?

858
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
A LOT OF PARENTS AROUND THE

859
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
WORLD ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

860
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
WHAT TO SAY TO THEIR CHILD.

861
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
>> YOU KNOW, THE HARD THING FOR

862
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
ME IS I'M A NEW YORKER AND I

863
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
GUESS I'M ACCUSTOMED TO

864
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
MANHATTAN AND ALWAYS TELLING MY

865
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
KIDS TO BE CAREFUL.
I GUESS YOU NEVER EXPECT IT TO

866
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
HAPPEN IN YOUR SCHOOL.

867
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU JUST

868
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
LET HER TALK.

869
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
SHE MENTIONED QUITE A BIT ABOUT

870
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
THE PRINCIPAL, WHO MANY OF US

871
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
WORKED WITH.

872
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I ADORED HER.

873
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I WORKED WITH HER PERSONALLY

874
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
WITH MY BUSINESS.

875
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
THAT IS ONE PERSON I KNOW WE

876
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
LOST ON A PERSONAL LEVEL.

877
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE

878
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
THE COUNSELLORS AT THE

879
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
INTERMEDIARY SCHOOL TODAY.
THEY WERE ALL WELCOME TO GO

880
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
THERE.

881
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
IF THEY NEED TO SPEAK TO
SOMEBODY, THEY WILL.

882
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
>> HAS YOUR DAUGHTER SAID MUCH

883
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
ABOUT WHAT SHE SAW OR HEARD?

884
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
>> SHE DID MENTION THAT SHE DID

885
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
OF COURSE HEAR GUNSHOTS.

886
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
THEY WERE ON THE SAME FLOOR.

887
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
HER TEACHER MANAGED TO TAKE TWO

888
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
CHILDREN OUT OF THE HALLWAY AND

889
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
PULL THEM INTO THE CLASSROOM.

890
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
LOCK THE DOOR AND MOVE EVERYBODY

891
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

892
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
ROOM.

893
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
IT WAS VERY CONFUSING AS IT

894
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
WOULD BE IN ANY OF THESE CASES

895
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
TO GO AND PICK UP YOUR CHILD

896
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
ONCE WE FIGURED OUT THAT

897
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
EVERYTHING WAS DISPATCHED TO

898
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

899
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PARENTS

900
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
THERE ALONG WITH A FRIEND OF

901
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
MINE.
WE FIGURED OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON

902
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
AND I RAN OVER THERE.

903
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THEY WERE SMART TO GET THEM OUT

904
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
OF THE BUILDING AND MOVE THEM

905
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
OVER TO THE FIREHOUSE.

906
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
YOU CAN SEE THAT MY DAUGHTER'S

907
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
TEACHER WAS VISIBLY UPSET AS

908
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
WELL AS MANY OF THE CHILDREN

909
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
THERE.

910
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
SHE DID A VERY HEROIC THING AND

911
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
PULLED TWO KIDS OUT OF THE HALL

912
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
WAY AND SHOVED THEM IN THE CLASS

913
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
AND LOCKED THE DOOR.

914
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
THE KIDS ARE GOING TO SUFFER

915
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
FROM THIS LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE.

916
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
IT'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL EVENT THAT

917
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
WILL TAKE TIME FOR HEALING.

918
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
AS LONG AS EVERYONE GETS THE

919
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
PROPER HELP, IT'S NOT SOMETHING

920
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
YOU SHAKE OFF EASILY AND NOT FOR

921
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
LITTLE PEOPLE.

922
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
WE LOST A LOT OF BABIES TODAY IN

923
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
THIS TOWN.

924
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
THERE A LOT OF VERY SAD
FAMILIES.

925
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
AS EVERYONE CAN THINK, YOU NEVER

926
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT

927
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
BASICALLY IT HAPPENS ALL OVER
THE WORLD AT THIS POINT.

928
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF

929
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
MENTAL HEALTH AND COGNIZANT OF

930
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
GUN CONTROL IN MY EYES.

931
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
AND ALSO ABOUT HOW SCHOOLS ARE

932
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
LOCKED UP THESE DAYS.

933
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE BUT YOU

934
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
HAVE TO THINK OF SOMEBODY

935
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
BLOWING THEM UP.

936
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
IT IS UNFORTUNATE STATE OF

937
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
AFFAIRS BUT REALITY THESE DAYS.

938
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
>> DENISE, I'M SORRY THAT THAT

939
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
REALITY WAS VISITED UPON YOUR

940
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
DAUGHTER TODAY AND EVERYBODY
ELSE.

941
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I WISH YOU STRENGTH AND PEACE IN
THE DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD.

942
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
THANK YOU FOR TALKING TONIGHT.

943
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, ANDERSON.

944
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
>> THERE WILL BE A LOT OF

945
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD.

946
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
LET'S GO BACK TO SOLEDAD.

947
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
>> AS WORD STARTED TO SPREAD

948
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
THROUGHOUT THE STATE TODAY,

949
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
CERTAINLY SO DID THE SHOCK AND

950
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
HORROR AND NOW THERE IS THE

951
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
GRIEVING.
>> YOU CAN NEVER BE PREPARED FOR

952
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
THIS KIND OF INCIDENT.

953
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
WHAT HAS HAPPENED, WHAT HAS
TRANSPIRED AT THAT SCHOOL

954
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
BUILDING WILL LEAVE A MARK ON

955
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
THIS COMMUNITY AND EVERY FAMILY

956
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
IMPACTED.

957
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I ONLY ASK THAT OUR FELLOW

958
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
CITIZENS HERE AND AROUND THE

959
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
WORLD WHO OFFERED THEIR

960
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
ASSISTANCE REMEMBER ALL OF THE

961
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
VICTIMS IN THEIR PRAYERS.

962
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
>> THAT WAS CONNECTICUT

963
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
GOVERNOR'S GOVERNOR MALLOY

964
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
SPEAKING EARLIER TODAY.

965
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
HE SAID HIS MAIN OBJECTIVE IS

966
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
WORKING WITH FEDERAL AND LOCAL

967
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
AUTHORITIES.
SUSAN CANDIOTTI HAS BEEN

968
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
HANDLING THE COVERAGE OF THE

969
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
INVESTIGATION.
LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT WE KNOW

970
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
ABOUT THE SHOOTER.

971
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
>> NOT VERY MUCH.

972
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
THAT HE IS 20 YEARS OLD.

973
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
WE UNDERSTAND THAT HE CAME TO

974
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
THE SCHOOL WITH THREE WEAPONS.

975
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
TWO OF THEM WERE HANDGUNS.

976
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
WITH ONE DESCRIBED AS A GLOCK,

977
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
ONE DESCRIBED AS A SIG SAUER AND

978
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
ANOTHER ONE NOT FOUND IN THE

979
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
CLASSROOM WITH HIM BUT IN A CAR

980
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL THAN IS

981
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
CALLED A.223 BUSHMASTER WHICH IS

982
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
A SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPON.

983
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
IT SEEMS THOSE GUNS WERE NOT

984
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
REGISTERED TO HIM, BUT WE ARE

985
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
TOLD, ACCORDING TO TOUR LAW
ENFORCEMENT SOURCES THEY BELONG

986
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
TO HIS MOTHER, WHICH IS, DON'T

987
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
HAVE AN EXPLAN MAGS FOR THAT

988
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
RIGHT NOW.

989
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
>> ALL OF THOSE GUNS LEGALLY

990
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
PURCHASED IN THE STATE.

991
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
>> YES.

992
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
WE WERE TOLD THEY WERE LEGALLY

993
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
PURCHASED AND REGISTERED IN THE

994
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
STATE OF CONNECTICUT.

995
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
BUT HOW DID HE GET AHOLD THEM WE

996
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
DON'T KNOW.

997
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
WE BELIEVE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

998
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
LIVING WITH HIS MOTHER.

999
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I SAY THAT BECAUSE OUR SOURCES

1000
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
SAY HIS MOTHER'S BODY WAS FOUND

1001
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
INSIDE OF A RESIDENCES AND SHE

1002
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
LIVES IN THE AIR.

1003
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
IT IS POSSIBLE HE LIVED WITH HIS

1004
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
MOTHER.

1005
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
STIMWAITI

1006
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
STILL WAITING FOR THAT DETAIL.

1007
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
>> POLICE WENT AND TOOK THE

1008
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
BROTHER FOR QUESTIONING AS WELL.

1009
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
>> THE BROTHER IS A LITTLE

1010
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
OLDER, 24 YEARS OLD.

1011
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
HE LIVES IN AN APARTMENT IN

1012
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
HOBOKEN.

1013
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
AUTHORITIES NATURALLY DID GO TO

1014
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
HIM TO ASK HIM QUESTIONS ABOUT

1015
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
HIS BROTHER.

1016
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
EVERYONE IS BEING PRETTY TIGHT

1017
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
LIPPED ABOUT WHAT HE TOLD THE

1018
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
AUTHORITIES, BUT ALSO HIS FATHER

1019
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
HAS BEEN QUESTIONED, AS WELL.

1020
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
HIS FATHER IS DIVORCED FROM THE

1021
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
MOTHER WHO WAS KILLED IN THIS

1022
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
INCIDENT.

1023
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
AND SO WE ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO

1024
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
FIND OUT MORE.

1025
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
>> SUSAN CANDIOTTI, THE

1026
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
INVESTIGATION CONTINUES.

1027
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
THANK YOU FOR REPORTING ON THAT,

1028
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER'S MOTHER.

1029
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
WE WILL OBVIOUSLY GET MORE

1030
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
INFORMATION AS WELL.
LET'S GET BACK TO ANDERSON FOR

1031
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
MORE.
>> YEAH, SOLEDAD, WE ARE

1032
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
LIMITING THE USE OF THE KILLER'S

1033
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
NAME.
WE DON'T WANT TO REPIET IT OVER

1034
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
AND OVER AGAIN.

1035
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
WE DON'T WANT IT TO GIVE HIM A

1036
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
HOUSEHOLD NAME AND WE DON'T WANT

1037
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
TO GIVE ENCOURAGEMENT TO SOMEONE

1038
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
WHO THINKS THEY CAN SOLVE

1039
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
SOMETHING THROUGH MURDER.

1040
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
DREW GRIFFIN IS JOINING ME LIVE.

1041
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
>> ANDERSON, HAVING COVERED SO

1042
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
MANY OF THESE IT IS PLAYING OUT

1043
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
IN A SICKENING ROUTINE, A

1044
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
SHOOTER WITH POSSIBLE MENTAL

1045
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
HEALTH ISSUES.

1046
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
A FAMILY TRYING TO DEAL WITH

1047
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
THOSE ISSUES.

1048
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
SOMETHING SNAPS.
A GUN IS EASILY ACCESSED AND AN

1049
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
OUTBURST OF VIOLENCE IN THE CASE

1050
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
OF THIS 20-YEAR-OLD SHOOTER.

1051
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
IT IS PLAYING OUT EXACTLY IN

1052
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
THAT ORDER.

1053
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW.

1054
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
THE 20-YEAR-OLD HAD AN OLDER

1055
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
BROTHER.

1056
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
THAT BROTHER REPORTEDLY TOLD ABC

1057
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
NEWS THE SHOOTER HAD A

1058
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

1059
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
HE ALSO MENTIONED AUTISM.

1060
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
CNN HEARD THAT SAME INFORMATION

1061
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
FROM A MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF A

1062
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
FRIEND OF THE SHOOTERS IN

1063
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
NEWTOWN WHERE THE SHOOTER LIVED.

1064
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
WE CAN NOW CONFIRM THE TWO

1065
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
HANDGUNS AND SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE

1066
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
WERE, AS SUSAN SAID, LEGALLY

1067
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
OWNED BY THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER,

1068
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
NOW LEGALLY DECEASED.

1069
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
AND IS STANDARD IN THESE CASES

1070
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
WE FIND PEOPLE THAT ARE SHOCKED

1071
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
THAT THE PARTICULAR SHOOTER

1072
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
COULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN

1073
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
ANYTHING LIKE THIS, AS IS THE

1074
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
CASE WITH ONE OF THE SHOOTER'S

1075
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
FORMER CLASSMATES AND FORMER

1076
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
SCHOOL BUS DRIVER.

1077
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAID TODAY.

1078
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
>> JUST A KID.

1079
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
>> JUST A KID.

1080
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
>> JUST A KID.

1081
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
>> NEVER ANTI-SOCIAL?

1082
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
>> NO.

1083
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
NO.

1084
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
>> TROUBLEMAKER?

1085
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
>> NO.

1086
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
DEFINITELY NOT.

1087
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
>> NOTICEABLE?

1088
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
>> DID HE BLEND IN TO THE

1089
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
BACKGROUND?

1090
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
YEAH.

1091
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
NOTHING THAT WOULD WARRANT ANY

1092
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
OF THIS.

1093
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
>> THEY ARE SAYING HE WENT AFTER

1094
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
HIS MOM AND HER CLASS OF KIDS.

1095
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
CAN YOU WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND

1096
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
THAT?
>> NO, I CANNOT.

1097
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD DO
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

1098
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
>> SO YOUR GENERAL SENSE IS

1099
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
WHAT?

1100
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
THIS IS UNSPEAKABLE.

1101
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT, I'M

1102
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
STILL IN SHOCK.

1103
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I WANT TO GO.

1104
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I NEED TO GO WALK.

1105
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
>> HE WAS A NICE KID.

1106
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
VERY POLITE.

1107
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
SHE RAISED VERIER NICE BOYS TO

1108
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
ME.
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT IS A SHOCK

1109
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
TO EVEN KNOW THEM AND REALIZE

1110
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
WHO THEY ARE.
AND WHAT HE DID.

1111
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT

1112
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
HAPPENED.

1113
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
THAT HE SNAPPED, WHAT HAVE YOU

1114
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
AND HE TOOK SUCH INNOCENT LIVES.

1115
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
SO WHAT CAN WE EXPECT?

1116
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
ANDERSON, AS WE LEARNED IN THE

1117
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
OTHER CASES, VIRGINIA TECH, THE

1118
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
SHOOTING OF CONGRESSWOMAN

1119
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
GIFFORDS, THE MASS SHOOTING IN

1120
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
THE MOVIE THEATER IN COLORADO, I

1121
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
THINK BY TOMORROW WE WILL SEE IN

1122
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
HINDSIGHT, MULTIPLE WARNING

1123
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
SIGNS.

1124
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
DANGEROUS MESSAGES IGNORED OR AN

1125
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
OBSESSION WITH THE MOM'S GUNS

1126
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
THAT WEREN'T TAKEN SERIOUSLY OR

1127
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
THE FAMILY, IN MANY CASES,

1128
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THE

1129
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
SITUATION.
THEY DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO

1130
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
TURN.
THERE WILL NEVER BE AN ANSWER OR

1131
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
AN EXPLANATION THAT COULD BE

1132
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
ANYWHERE NEAR GOOD ENOUGH FOR

1133
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES TO

1134
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
UNDERSTAND THIS.

1135
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
A LOT OF CASES IT IS SENSELESS

1136
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
AND NEVER UNDERSTOOD.

1137
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
>> YEAH.

1138
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
IN HEARING ONE OF THE PEOPLE SAW

1139
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
AUTISTIC, OR COULD BE AUTISTIC,

1140
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
THAT DOESN'T -- I'VE NEVER HEARD

1141
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
OF SOMEBODY WHO IS AUTISTIC

1142
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1143
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
>> IT IS TWO SEPARATE THINGS.

1144
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
THE BROTHER SAID PERSONALITY

1145
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
DISORDER AND ALSO AUTISTIC.

1146
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PUT THOSE

1147
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
TOGETHER OR SAYING ONE LEADS TO

1148
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
THE OTHER BUT THERE WERE SOME
EARLY HINTS, LIKE WE HAVE SEEN

1149
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
IN OTHER CASES WHERE THERE IS A

1150
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
MENTAL ISSUE GOING ON AND WE

1151
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
LEARN MORE AS THINGS GO ON THAT

1152
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN WARNING

1153
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
SIGNS.

1154
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
THAT'S WHAT I EXPECT AND SEEN A

1155
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
LOT OF EXPERTS EXPECT TALKING

1156
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
ABOUT THIS.
>> THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF

1157
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
DEBATE OVER GUN ISSUES AND GUN

1158
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
CONTROL.
CONNECTICUT HAS STRICT GUN LAWS

1159
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
AND THESE GUNS WERE LEGALLY

1160
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
PURCHASED AS FAR AS WE KNOW BY

1161
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
THE MOTHER.

1162
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

1163
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
IF YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE A GUN

1164
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
LAW THAT PREVENT YOU WOULD HAVE

1165
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
TO TAKE THIS WOMAN'S LEGALLY

1166
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
OWNED GUNS AWAY.

1167
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
THAT'S BASICALLY IT.

1168
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
THE REASON WE FOUND OUT SO SOON

1169
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
WHERE THE GUNS COME FROM,

1170
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
BECAUSE CONNECTICUT HAS ITS OWN

1171
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
REGISTRY.
THE HANDGUNS ARE REGISTERED.

1172
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
YOU HAVE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

1173
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
CERTIFICATE TO OWN HANDGUN AND

1174
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
THAT OWN COMES WITH A TEST, NOT

1175
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
A TEST BUT A CLASS, A HANDGUN

1176
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
SAFETY CLASS.

1177
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
NOBODY UNDER 21 CAN OWN A

1178
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
HANDGUN AND THEY HAVE AN ASSAULT

1179
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
WEAPONS BAN.

1180
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
THIS ASSAULT RIFLE, I DON'T HAVE

1181
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
THE DETAILS BUT IF IT WAS

1182
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
LEGALLY OWNED SHE MUST HAVE

1183
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
OWNED IT BEFORE '93 AND ALSO HAD

1184
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
A CERTIFICATE OF POSSESSION

1185
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
REGISTERED WITH THE STATE
BECAUSE SOME OLDER GUNS WERE

1186
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
GRANDFATHERED IN.

1187
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
YOU CAN'T HAVE AN ASSAULT WEAPON

1188
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT FROM

1189
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
WHAT I AM A READING FROM THE

1190
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
GUN.
>> THE OTHER QUESTION IS HOW

1191
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
WERE THE GUNS STORED.

1192
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
WERE THEY IN A LOCK BOX WHICH IS

1193
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
THE RECOMMENDED WAY TO STORE

1194
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
GUNS.
FOR PARENTS THE ORDEAL BEGAN

1195
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
WITH WORDS SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

1196
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
WAS ON A LOCKDOWN.

1197
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
THAT WAS THE FIRST WORD THAT

1198
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
PARENTS GOT.
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE WILL HAVE

1199
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
MORE ON WHAT HAPPENED THROUGHOUT
THE DAY.

TO KNOW ARE THEY SAFE ABOUT WHAT

1282
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
HAPPENED?
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S THE

1283
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
ONE THING YOU HAVE TO ASSURE

1284
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
THEM ABOUT.

1285
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE

1286
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
BEYOND ANY HUMAN CONTROL.

1287
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
WE HAVE TO TEACH THESE CHILDREN

1288
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
THAT THEY HAVE TO TRUST.

1289
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I KNOW IT IS A DIFFICULT WORLD

1290
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
IN WHICH WE LIVE AND IT IS VERY

1291
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
DIFFICULT TO TRUST EVERYONE, BUT

1292
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
THEY HAVE TO HAVE FAITH AND THEY

1293
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
HAVE TO HAVE FAITH IN GOD AND

1294
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
FAITH IN EACH OTHER.

1295
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I HOPE THAT THESE PARENTS WILL

1296
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
CERTAINLY LEARN FROM THIS ONCE

1297
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
AGAIN THE VALUE OF FAMILY AND

1298
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
KEEP PRIORITIES VERY STRAIGHT.

1299
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
THESE CHILDREN NEED TO KNOW THEY

1300
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
ARE LOVED, THAT THEY ARE IN

1301
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THEY CAN BE

1302
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
SAFE AND WHERE THEY CAN GROW UP

1303
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
TO BE PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS.

1304
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU TAKE THE

1305
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
FEAR OUT OF A CHILD'S HEART

1306
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
EXCEPT BY LOVE.

1307
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
THESE CHILDREN TODAY WERE DEEPLY

1308
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
LOVED BY THEIR PARENTS.

1309
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I'M SURE WHEN THEY DROP THEM OFF

1310
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
TO SCHOOL THIS MORNING THE LAST

1311
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
THING ON THEIR MIND OR THE MINDS

1312
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
OF THEIR CHILDREN IS THIS WOULD

1313
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
BE THE WAY THE DAY WILL END.

1314
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I HOPE PARENTS WILL TAKE THIS AS

1315
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THE

1316
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
CHILDREN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

1317
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
BEING FAMILY AND THE IMPORTANCE

1318
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
OF TRUSTING AND LOVING EACH

1319
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
OTHER.

1320
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS

1321
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
THINKING ABOUT TODAY AFTER THE

1322
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
AURORA SHOOTING IN AURORA,

1323
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
COLORADO THEY HAD A MEMORIAL

1324
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
SERVICE AND I REMEMBER THE

1325
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
SPEAKERS WOULD READ THE NAME OF

1326
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
EACH PERSON KILLED.

1327
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
THE CROWD WOULD SHOUT BACK, WE

1328
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
WILL REMEMBER YOU.

1329
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS SO

1330
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
POWERFUL AND I THOUGHT ABOUT

1331
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
THAT TODAY.
WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO EMPHASIZE

1332
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
THE IMPORTANCE OF REMEMBERING

1333
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
THE VICTIMS AND I THINK WE SAW

1334
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
THAT TONIGHT AT THE VIGIL

1335
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
SERVICE THAT YOU HELD WHERE

1336
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
PEOPLE WERE OUTSIDE.

1337
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
SO MANY PEOPLE WANTED TO GO THEY

1338
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
COULDN'T FIT IN.

1339
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
WAS YOUR MESSAGE TONIGHT?

1340
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
>> THE MESSAGE WAS THAT I

1341
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
THOUGHT THIS WAS A DAY ABOUT

1342
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
HEARTS.
I WITNESSED THIS MORNING BEING

1343
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
WITH THE FAMILIES.

1344
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I WAS WITH THEM ALMOST SIX

1345
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
HOURS, COMPASSIONATE, BROKEN

1346
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
HEARTS, CARING HEARTS AND IT WAS

1347
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
ABOUT LOVE LOST BUT LOVE NEVER

1348
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
FORGOTTEN.
I ENCOURAGE OUR PEOPLE TONIGHT

1349
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY.

1350
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
VIOLENCE IN THE MEDIA AND

1351
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.

1352
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
IT IS FILLING THEIR HEADS WITH

1353
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
AN AWARENESS THAT EVIL DOES

1354
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
EXIST IN THIS WORLD, BUT THAT

1355
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
GOOD ALWAYS CONQUERS EVIL.

1356
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
THE ONLY WAY WE WILL CHANGE IS

1357
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
BY COMING TOGETHER AS A

1358
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
COMMUNITY.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT.

1359
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER TO SUPPORT

1360
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
AND ENCOURAGE EACH OTHER AND TO

1361
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
LET EACH OTHER KNOW THERE IS A

1362
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
BETTER WAY TO LIVE.

1363
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID IF WE

1364
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
WORK TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY.

1365
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
>> I KNOW IT HAS BEEN A LONG DAY

1366
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000

>> NO QUESTION.

1378
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
FOR THOSE WHO LOST CHILDREN AND

1379
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
THOSE WHOSE CHILDREN SURVIVED

1380
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
THOSE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS.

1381
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
MANY PARENTS WERE TELLING US

1382
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY CAME

1383
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
RACING TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

1384
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
OVER HI SHOULDER.

1385
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
THEY GOT THE WORD THAT THE

1386
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
SCHOOL WAS ON LOCKDOWN AND THEY

1387
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
WERE PANICKED.

1388
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
SOME TRIED TO RUN TO THE SCHOOL.

1389
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
THEY WERE SENT TO A NEARBY FIRE

00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
ACCOUNTS THAT WE HAVE HEARD AS

00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
PEOPLE HAD TO SIT THERE AND WAIT

1393
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
TO SEE IF THEIR CHILDREN WERE

1394
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000

00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000

CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT WAS SAID

1418
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
TERRIFYING THING.
>> MY HUSBAND AND I WAS SITTING

00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
THEM OUT OF THE BUILDING AND

1463
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
BROUGHT THEM TO THE FIRE HOUSE.

1464
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
>> WE KNOW THE PRINCIPAL HAD

1465
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
INSTALLED A SYSTEM WHERE YOU

1466
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
HAVE TO BE BUZZED IN.

1467
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
>> YES.

1468
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
IT'S BEEN THAT WAY FOR THE TWO

1469
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
YEARS THAT WE HAVE BEEN HERE.

1470
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
YOU HAD TO BUZZ -- YOU HAVE TO

1471
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
RING A DOORBELL TO BE LET IN.

1472
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
THE OFFICE IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF

1473
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
THOSE DOORS.

1474
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
SO THEY CAN LOOK OUT AND SEE

1475
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
WHO'S AT THE DOOR.

1476
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
>> ANY REASON FOR THAT?

1477
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
IT IS TYPICAL IN BIG CITIES

1478
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
CERTAINLY, BUT IN COMMUNITIES

1479
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
THAT ARE PRETTY RURAL, IT'S A

1480
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
LITTLE BIT OF A RARITY

1481
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
SOMETIMES.

1482
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
>> I THINK IT IS JUST, THEY TAKE

1483
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN VERY

1484
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
SERIOUS.
IT'S A FAIRLY LARGE SCHOOL.

1485
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
THERE'S BETWEEN 500 AND 600

1486
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
STUDENTS THERE.

1487
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
THEY WANT TO KEEP CONTROL AND

1488
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
KNOW WHO'S IN THE BUILDING WITH

1489
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
OUR CHILDREN.
>> I WAS TALKING TO THE STATE

1490
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
POLICE AND THEY SAID THAT THEY

1491
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
ARE PROCESSING THE SCENE STILL

1492
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
WHICH MEANS THERE ARE STILL SOME

1493
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
CHILDREN INSIDE.

1494
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN TO YOUR SON

1495
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
WHAT HAS HAPPENED ABOUT HIS

1496
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
CLASSMATES?

1497
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
>> WE ARE A FAIRLY RELIGIOUS

1498
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
FAMILY AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT

1499
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
THEY HAVE GONE TO HEAVEN TO BE

1500
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
WITH JESUS AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL

1501
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
WE CAN SAY.

1502
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
TALK ABOUT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO

1503
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
SEE THEM ANYMORE AND THEY ARE

1504
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
NOT GOING TO BE AROUND.

1505
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
YOU REALLY STRUGGLE TO FIND THE

1506
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
WORDS, YOU KNOW, AS TO WHAT

1507
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
HAPPENED.
>> YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT EVERYONE

1508
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
IS SENDING WELL WISHES NOT JUST

1509
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY BUT YOUR

1510
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE.

1511
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME TO

1512
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
PASS THAT ALONG.

1513
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
>> WE'RE A STRONG COMMUNITY, A

1514
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
STRONG FAMILY COMMUNITY WITH A

1515
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
LOT OF LOVE.

1516
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I THINK THAT WE WILL GET THROUGH

1517
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
THIS SOMEHOW, SOME WAY.

1518
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1519
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
WE APPRECIATE IT.

1520
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
BACK TO ANDERSON.

1521
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
OH, HEY MIKE.

it on the sleigh.
