THE ASSAULT RIFLE USED IN THIS
TYPE OF SHOOTING TYPICALLY

291
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
CARRIES ABOUT 30 ROUNDS OR SO.

292
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
BUT IT COULD CARRY UP TO 100
ROUNDS OR MORE.

293
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
IT CAN FIRE A BARRAGE OF BULLETS

294

IN SECONDS.
THAT'S WHY THOSE CHILDREN WERE

295
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
KILLED SO QUICKLY.

296

I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO WIN
ON GOLF'S BIGGEST STAGES.

441

BUT WHEN JOINT PAIN
AND STIFFNESS

442
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
FROM PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS HIT,

443
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
EVEN THE SMALLEST THINGS
BECAME DIFFICULT.

444
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I FINALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT
SERIOUS JOINT PAIN IS LIKE.

445
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I TALKED TO MY RHEUMATOLOGIST
AND HE PRESCRIBED Enbrel.

446
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Enbrel CAN HELP RELIEVE
PAIN, STIFFNESS,

447
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
AND STOP JOINT DAMAGE.

448
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
BECAUSE Enbrel, ETANERCEPT,
SUPPRESSES YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM,

449
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
IT MAY LOWER YOUR ABILITY
TO FIGHT INFECTIONS.

AND NERVOUS SYSTEM AND
BLOOD DISORDERS HAVE OCCURRED.

454
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
BEFORE STARTING Enbrel,

455
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
YOUR DOCTOR SHOULD TEST YOU
FOR TUBERCULOSIS

456
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
AND DISCUSS WHETHER
YOU'VE BEEN TO A REGION

457
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
WHERE CERTAIN FUNGAL INFECTIONS
ARE COMMON.

458
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
DON'T START Enbrel IF YOU HAVE
AN INFECTION LIKE THE FLU.

459
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR
IF YOU'RE PRONE TO INFECTIONS,

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
HAVE CUTS OR SORES,
HAVE HAD HEPATITIS B,

HAVE BEEN TREATED
FOR HEART FAILURE,

EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT FEVER,
