1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Ty:
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA GET TO SEE

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
YOUR FRIEND J.R. MARTINEZ.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
HOW'S EVERYTHING?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
ALL RIGHT.
MICHAEL, THIS LOOKS INCREDIBLE.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
IS THIS AWESOME?
YEAH.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
PRETTY SURE
THIS IS THE BIGGEST FLAG

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
IN ANYBODY'S FRONT YARD
IN TEXAS.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN, AND
THEY'RE DEFINITELY GONNA
CUT BACK ON HIS WATER BILL

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT
A BUNCH OF SOD OUT HERE.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
YEAH, THIS IS
DROUGHT-TOLERANT.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
THIS IS GREAT. AT LEAST
HE WON'T HAVE TO COME OUT HERE

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
AND TRY TO WATER AND MOW
A BUNCH OF GRASS.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
COOL. LET'S GET THAT.
I'LL GET SOME MORE STONES.
AWESOME. THANKS.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
THIS LOOKS AMAZING, YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU!

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Man: MOVING FORWARD
WITH OUR SOLAR PANELS.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
HOW BIG?
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
WE'RE LOOKING AT 5.7
KILOWATTS -- 5,700 KILOWATTS.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
WHAT CAN A FAMILY EXPECT TO SAVE
ON A MONTHLY BILL?

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
A SYSTEM SIZE LIKE THIS,

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
WE'RE GONNA LOOK TO SAVE
ABOUT 70% TO 80%.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
WE ACTUALLY FEED
INTO THE UTILITY GRID,

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
SO IT'LL SHOOT
BACK INTO THE GRID.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
THEY'RE GONNA GET A CREDIT
ON THEIR BILL

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
THAT THEY'LL SEE
THE NEXT MONTH.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
SO, THIS THING IS ALWAYS
EARNING THEM MONEY,

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT HERE?
ALWAYS. ALWAYS.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
GREAT THINGS
ABOUT THESE SYSTEMS --

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
THIS THING WILL LAST
40 YEARS.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
OH, MAGIC.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Ty: HEY, PAIGE!
Paige: HEY, TY.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
HOW'S IT GOING OVER HERE?
IT'S GOOD.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOKING AWESOME.
I LOVE THE WOOD BACK THERE.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
ISN'T THAT COOL?
WE DID BURNED PLYWOOD.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
EASY TO DO
AND IT'S A COOL LOOK.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
THIS IS A STABLE
FOR TWO HORSES.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
YOU KNOW, KATHREYN --
SHE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO
KEEP HER HORSE HERE,

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
AND THAT'S
WHAT SHE LOVES TO DO,

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
SO WE'RE GONNA BRING
THE HORSE BACK,

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
WE GOT A TACK ROOM THERE,
A PLACE FOR HER TO FEED,

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
AND IT'S GONNA BE COVERED
FROM THE HOT SUN ALL DAY.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
AND WE'RE GONNA BE GETTING
SOME HAY, TOO, RIGHT?

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT. AWESOME.
LOOKS GOOD.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
ED! XZIBIT!
Xzibit: YO!

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
HOW'S THE OLD WESTERN TOWN
COMING ALONG?

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
IT'S GOOD!
Ed: COMING ALONG
GREAT, BROTHER.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I TELL YOU WHAT -- WE'VE GOT
THREE SUPER-NICE BUILDINGS.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
WE'VE GOT A JAILHOUSE,
WE'VE GOT A HOTEL,

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
AND WHAT WAS
THE LAST ONE?

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
GENERAL STORE.
GENERAL STORE.

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Ed:
LITTLE ELIZABETH LOVES

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
EVERYTHING TO DO
WITH THE WILD WEST,

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
SO WE ARE GOING TO BUILD
THREE HUGE WILD-WEST PLAYHOUSES

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
IN HER BACKYARD.

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
SO, IT'S NOT JUST A FACADE?
YOU GUYS CAN GO IN?

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
ENCLOSED STRUCTURE,
SO THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PLAY
AND HANG OUT INSIDE.

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
DUDE, AWESOME.
I LOVE IT. KEEP IT UP.

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
MICHAEL,
HOW'S THE GREEN COMING?
CHECK IT OUT, MAN.

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
WE'RE ACTUALLY LAYING DOWN
THE TURF RIGHT NOW.

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
WE'VE GOT THREE HOLES HERE.
WE'VE GOT A SAND TRAP OVER HERE.

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Michael: ONE OF SHILO'S
FAVORITE THINGS TO DO WAS GOLF,

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
SO I'M WORKING ON FINDING A WAY

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
TO GET SHILO BACK ON THE GOLF
COURSE BUT IN THE BACKYARD.

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
WE'RE COMING UP
WITH AN APPARATUS

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
THAT'LL ACTUALLY HELP HIM
BE ABLE TO HOLD THAT GOLF CLUB,

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
'CAUSE THAT'S BEEN
THE PROBLEM.
RIGHT.

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
SO, HE'LL BE ABLE TO GET OUT
HERE AND GET BACK ON THE COURSE

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
AND BE WITH HIS KIDS
AND THE FAMILY.

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
AND THEN YOU'RE PUTTING OUT
THE GREEN RIGHT NOW?
YEAH.
YOU READY FOR THIS?

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
LET'S ROLL IT OUT.
LET'S ROLL IT OUT.

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
KEEP IT COMING. KEEP IT COMING.
A LITTLE BIT FURTHER. NICE.

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
HEY, GUYS.
HOW'S IT GOING IN HERE?

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I BROUGHT THIS ROPE,
AND I THOUGHT

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
WE COULD MAKE HER NAME
ON THE WALL.

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
SO, YOU THINK WE CAN?
YEAH, LET'S TRY THAT.

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
HER NAME'S ELIZABETH,
BUT I'M THINKING

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
WE GO WITH HER NICKNAME,
WHICH IS LIZZIE.

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
SO, LIKE "I" AND THEN DO A "Z"
AND GO ALL THE WAY UP.

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
AND WHERE YOU GIRLS
ARE STANDING,

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
IT'S KIND OF
WHERE THE TEPEE'S GONNA BE,

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
SO WHEN SHE COMES OUT OF THE
TEPEE, SHE CAN COME UP HERE,

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
CHECK OUT HER NAME --
VERY GIRLY.

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
MICHAEL, WHAT YOU DOING?

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
WE GOT
THE TOUCHSCREEN HERE

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
THAT XZIBIT'S WORKING ON
FOR THE OFFICE, RIGHT?

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
SO, I SEE HE'S GONE
TO sears.com.
YEP.

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
AND I'M JUST ABOUT TO BUY
THAT BARBECUE RIGHT THERE.

88
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
IS THAT SWEET?

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED?
WHAT?

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
SOMETHING FUN
THAT HE CAN DO WITH HIS KIDS.
I GOT A TV.

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'M MOUNTING A TV OUTSIDE,
WHICH IS GONNA BE SWEET.

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
BUT WHAT ELSE?
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
WELL, I WAS JUST THINKING
SOMETHING,

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
LIKE, HE COULD PLAY
WITH HIS KIDS, YOU KNOW?

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
LIKE, HOW ABOUT --
YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO?

96
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
LIKE, HAVE, LIKE,
AIR HOCKEY.

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
PERFECT.
LET ME GO RIGHT THERE.

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Michael: SHILO LOVES TO HANG OUT
WITH HIS KIDS,

99
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
AND SO WE'RE GONNA DO
AN INDOOR/OUTDOOR ROOM

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THAT'LL BE CLIMATE-CONTROLLED,

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
FULL OF FUN AND ACTIVITIES
FOR THE FAMILY TO BE TOGETHER.

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I THINK
THAT IS THE PERFECT ONE.

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
PERFECT. WE'RE GONNA DO
A LITTLE EXPRESS CHECKOUT. BOOM.

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
NOW THAT WE'VE ORDERED
EVERYTHING,

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
ALL WE NEED TO DO
IS GO PICK IT UP AT SEARS.

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
THEY'LL HAVE EVERYTHING
WAITING FOR US,

107
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
AND THEN THE ROOM IS DONE.

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
KIND OF AWESOME.
YEAH.

109
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
WELL, SINCE I PICKED
EVERYTHING OUT, YOU
GET TO GO PICK IT UP.

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
OH. OKAY.

111
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
HEY, TY.
YO.

112
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO SOMEBODY, MAN.

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
THIS IS ADAM, MAN.

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
HE WAS ACTUALLY
IN THE HUMVEE

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
WHEN SHILO WAS HIT
WITH THE I.E.D.

116
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
YOU'RE ADAM?
YES, SIR.

117
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
WOW.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE, MAN.

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
HEY, ABSOLUTELY. I WOULDN'T
MISS THIS FOR THE WORLD.

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
THIS LOOKS AMAZING.

120
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU,
BECAUSE, LIKE,

121
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
SHILO'S PERSONALITY, YOU CAN'T
MISS IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

122
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
LIKE,
WAS HE ALWAYS THAT WAY?

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
SHILO HAS A KNACK
FOR PICKING PEOPLE UP.

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
YOU KNOW,
GOING THROUGH 18-HOUR DAYS,

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
NO MATTER HOW TIRED WE WERE,
SHILO COULD MAKE YOU SMILE.

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
HE'S JUST A REAL GOOD GUY.

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
HE WAS TELLING ME
THAT WHEN THE I.E.D. WENT OFF,

128
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
IT BASICALLY WENT OFF
RIGHT UNDERNEATH YOU, DIDN'T IT?

129
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
YEAH.
I GOT HURT REAL BAD,

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
AND THEN THEY SPLIT ME
UP THE MIDDLE A LITTLE BIT.

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
AAH!
YEAH.

132
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
AND THEN I GOT
SOME SHRAPNEL WOUNDS TO MY ARMS,

133
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
AND THEN I GOT A DENT
IN MY HEAD

134
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
AND SOME SKIN GRAFTS
ON THE BACK OF MY LEGS.

135
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
YOU KNOW, COMPARED TO SHILO,
I GOT LUCKY.
WOW.

136
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
BOTH OF YOU GUYS ARE EXTREMELY
LUCKY TO BE HERE TODAY.

137
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
YEAH, MAN. WELL,
WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU, MAN.

138
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
HEY, I APPRECIATE IT.
WELL,
I HATE TO INTERRUPT.

139
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS WORKING ON?
WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS?

140
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW,
SHILO HAS ONE OF HIS THINGS

141
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
THAT HE SAYS
ALL THE TIME.

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
HE'S BUILDING BRIDGES
TO OPEN HEARTS.

143
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
SO, THAT'S WHAT --
WE'VE MADE THIS OUT OF METAL,

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
AND THESE ARE GONNA GO
AROUND THE FLAGPOLE.

145
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
OH, RIGHT ON.
ALL THE WAY UP.

146
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
ALL THE WAY UP, YEAH.
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL IDEA.

147
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE A PART
OF THIS, MAN.

148
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LOOK --

149
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I GOT TO RUN.
I'LL MEET UP WITH YOU LATER.

150
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
VERY NICE MEETING YOU.
THANK YOU, GUYS.

151
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
WE'LL BE HERE.
ALL RIGHT, ADAM.

152
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
LET'S GET THIS STUFF
MOVING.
ALL RIGHTY.

153
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
SO, THE PARK HAS BEEN
PRETTY MUCH WELL-RECEIVED, THEN?

154
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Hartman:
WELL BEYOND OUR EXPECTATIONS.

155
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Ed: OUR BUILDER, GORDON,
DECIDED TO INVITE ME

156
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
DOWN TO HIS THEME PARK THAT HE
BUILT, NAMED AFTER HIS DAUGHTER.

157
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
SO, WHAT IS THE MAIN THEME,
THEN, WITH THIS PARK?

158
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
THIS IS A PARK
THAT IS ENGINEERED

159
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
WITH SPECIAL NEEDS IN MIND
BUT BUILT FOR EVERYONE.

160
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
THIS THEME PARK CATERS
FOR KIDS AND ADULTS

161
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
THAT HAVE DIFFERENT ABILITIES.

162
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
WHAT THIS PARK DOES
IS BRING DOWN THOSE BARRIERS

163

ON MY UPPER TORSO,

I'M TRULY BLESSED.

ACTUALLY SAVED MY EYES.

THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
YOU LOOK LIKE ON THE OUTSIDE.

HOW DIFFERENT YOU ARE.

WHAT MATTERS IS, YOU
KNOW, WHAT'S DEEPER
THAN A THIRD-DEGREE BURN

JUST A WONDERFUL PLACE

TO ENJOY EACH OTHER

852

AND RECONNECT ON A LEVEL OF A
HUSBAND AND A WIFE AND A COUPLE

853

SO, COME ON IN.

856
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
OKAY, SO...

857
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
SO, YOUR BATHROOM
HAS ALSO GOT

858
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
ITS OWN AIR-FILTRATION
SYSTEM, OKAY?

859
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
SO, YOU'VE GOT SUPER-CLEAN,
FILTERED AIR.

860
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
THIS BATHTUB IS ACTUALLY
VERY, VERY DEEP,

861
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
JUST LIKE AT THE DOCTOR'S,

862
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
SO YOU CAN SUBMERGE
YOUR WHOLE BODY AND YOUR SKIN.

863
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
SO, THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY GOOD
FOR YOU FOR THERAPY,

864
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
BY SUBMERGING IN WATER.

865
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
YOU CAN CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE
OVER THERE,

866
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
AND YOU CAN ALSO SET
YOUR OWN MUSIC TO IT

867
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
SO IT ACTUALLY VIBRATES
AND SOOTHES YOU.

868
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000

DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

869
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
AND OVER HERE,
THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE SHOWER.

870
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
THIS...

871
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL --
IT'S -- IT'S A STEAM SHOWER.

872
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
AND SO WITH THAT RIGHT THERE,

873
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SET
THE TEMPERATURE

874
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
SO THE WATER
DOESN'T HAVE TO HIT YOUR SKIN,

875
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
BUT THE STEAM ITSELF
CAN ACTUALLY DO IT.

876
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
SO, THAT WAY,
IF THE WATER HURTS,

877
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUST USE
THE STEAM.

878
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
THESE ARE ALL JUST WAYS
THAT MAKE LIFE A LITTLE EASIER,

879
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
A LITTLE LESS PAINFUL,

880
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
AND HOPEFULLY
A LITTLE MORE RELAXING.

THESE SURGERIES AND PROCEDURES
ARE GONNA CHALLENGE MY SKIN.

ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
THERE'S STILL GONNA BE --

884
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
THE STEAM SHOWER, I THINK,
IS REALLY GONNA HELP WITH THAT.
