00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

192
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
THEY WERE TERRIFIED.

193
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.
AND HE WAS PUTTING IT TOGETHER

194
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
HE TOCK THEM TO HIS HOUSE AND

195
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
HAD THEM, A BUS DRIVER SHOWED

196
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
UP AND SHE HAD THE PHONE

197
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
NUMBERS TO THE CHILDREN'S

198
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
PARENTS AND THEY CALLED THE

199
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
PARENTS TO LET THEM KNOW THEY

200
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
WERE OKAY .

201
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
HE GAVE THEM JUICE AND STUFFED

202
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
ANIMALS AND HE WAS THERE FOR

203
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
THEM.

204
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
>> Gretchen: ANOTHER MOTHER

205
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
CAME TO HIS DOOR AND SAID I

206
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
HEARD YOU HAD SOME OF THE

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
SURVERIFYING CHILDREN HERE AT

208
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
THE HOME, DID YOU HAVE MY

209
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
CHILD AND HE SAID HE LATER

210
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
READ THAT THAT CHOILED HAD

211
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
DIED.

212
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
>> Brian: SO MUCH OF THAT

213
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
STORY THESE KIDS ARE ABLE TO

214
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
ABSORB.
THE BIG GUN AND LITTLE GUN .

215
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
THAT MEANS THEY DIDN'T STAY IN

216
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THE CLOSEST.

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
THEY RAN OUT PROBABLY ALL AT

218
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
THE SAME TIME MAYBE NOT IN THE

219
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
SAME SECTION.

220
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
SIX PANICKED RAN OUT AND

221
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
OTHERS STAYED.

222
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
IT SEEMS BY WHAT THE KIDS ARE

223
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
SAYING.
THEY RAN OUT ASK THEY AVOIDED

224
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
BEING SHOT.

225
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
AND SOME OF THE FAMILIES ARE

226
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
DEALING WITH THIS IN WAYS.

227
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT

228
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
YOU TELL THEM ABOUT WHAT

229
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
HAPPENED.

230
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
A LOT OF THE KIDS HAVE NOT

231
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
BEEN TOLD WHAT HAPPENED.

232
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
AND A LOT OF PARENTS ARE NOT

233
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
GOING TO LET THE KIDS GO TO

234
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
SCHOOL FOR A WHILE.
AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO

235
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
SEE HOW MANY KIDS DO GO THAT

236
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
FAR.
FOX NEWS CONFIRMED THAT THE

237
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
PRESIDENT OF IRAQ IS IN A COMA

238
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
AFTER SUFFERING A STROKE.

239
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
THEY ARE NOT DECOIDED WHETHER

240
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
HE WILL BE FLOWN TO ANOTHER

241
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
COUNTRY FOR TREATMENT.

242
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
HE HAD SIGNS OF FATIGUE.

243
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
DOW JONES WILL TRY TO SELL THE

244
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
GOP ON THE LATEST PLAN TO

245
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
AVOID GOING OFF THE FISCAL

246
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
CLIFF .

247
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
SOURS SAY IT INCLUDES ONE

248
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
TRILLION IN SPENDING CUTS AND

249
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
ONE TRILLION IN REVENUE ALSO

250
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
THE CHANCE THAT THE DEBT

251
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
CEILING WOULD BE INCROSED ONE

252
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
YEAR AND STILL YET TO BE

253
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
DETERMINED IF TAX RATES WILL

254
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
GO UP FOR SOME AMERICANS.

255
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
THE PRESIDENT IS OFFERING A

256
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
TAX RATE HIKE ON THOSE MAKES

257
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
MORE THAN $400,000 A YEAR .

258
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THAT IS A CHANGE FROM $250,000

259
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
OR AND SOME REPUBLICANS ARE

260
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
CONCERNED THAT PARTY LEADERS

261
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
HAVE MADE TOO MANY

262
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
CONCESSIONS.

263
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
KEY LAW MAKERS ARE DETAILED ON

WILL TESTIFY ABOUT THE ACT IN

269
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
FRONT OF CONGRESS.

270
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
SHE FELL AND SUFFERED A

271
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
CONCUSSION AND WILL NOT BE

272
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
ABLE TO BE THERE.

273
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE

274
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
UNITED NATIONS DOESN'T BELIEVE

275
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
IT ADDS UP.

276
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
>> EVERY FOREIGN MINISTRY

277
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
KNOWS THE PHRASE I WILL ABOUT

278
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
TO USE.
WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO A

279
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
MEETING OR CONFERENCE EVENT

280
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
YOU HAVE A DIPLOMATIC ILLNESS

281
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
AND THIS IS ONE TO BEAT THE

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
BAND.

283
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I CERTAINLY HOPE IT IS NOTHING

284
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
SERIOUS AND THIS WAS REVEAL

285
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
WOULD IN A WAY THAT WAS NOT

286
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
TRANSPARENT AND I THINK THERE

287
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
IS AN OBLIGATION HERE.

288
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
>> DOCTORS SAY IT MAY TAKE

289
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE

290
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
MRS. CLINTON CAN GET BACK TO

291
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
WORK.

292
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
>> HE REPRESENTS HAWAII FROM

293
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
THE TIME IT BICAME A STATE IN

294
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
1951.

295
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
AND IN 1945 IN WORLD WAR II,

296
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
HE WAS LOBBYING HAND GRENADES

297
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
TO THE ENEMY AND LOST HIS ROIT

298
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
ARM.

299
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
HE WAS FRIENDS WITH A FELLOW

AMERICAN SOLDIER NAMED BOB

301
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000

THE SENATOR DIED FROM

305
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
RESPIRATORY COMPLICATIONS AND

306
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
HE WAS 88 YEARS OLD AND HIS

307
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
LAST WORD WAS ALOHA.

308
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
>> Steve: WE TOLD YOU THE

309
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
STORY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

310
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
WEEKS BY THE MARINE BY THE

RICKA AND WHEN HE WAS IN

314
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
MATAMORAS MEXICO.

315
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
HE DECLARED I HAVE THIS GUN

316
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
AND THEY SAY IT IS NOT A

317
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
PROPER SIZE.

318
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
THEY THREW HIM IN JAIL.

319
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
HE DID NOT HAVE THE PROPER

320
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
PERMITS.
BUT WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT

321
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
THAT ISOLATION CELL.

322
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
IT IS A STORAGE CLOSEST.

323
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
THE BED.

325
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
AND WE INTERVIEWED HIS MOTHER

326
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
AND HE'S BEEN CHAINED THEIR

327
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
SINCE AUGUST.

328
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
HE GOT THE GUN FROM HIS GREAT

329
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
GRAND FATHER HE REGISTERED IT

330
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
BEFORE HE CROSSED THE BORDER

331
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
AND HE WAS TOLD IT IS OKAY.

332
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
IS HE HELD ILLEGALLY ON FALSE

RUBIO AND OTHERS TO HELP HIM.

336
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
SO FAR, THE STATE DEPARTMENT

337
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
DOES NOT APPEAR THEY ARE

338
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
INVOLVED AS SOME BELIEVE THEY

339
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
SHOULD .
>> Brian: HERE'S THE BIG

340
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
THING.
IT TURNS OUT THE GUN IS LEGAL

341
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
.
HE SHOULDN'T BE IN JAIL LET

342
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
ALONE TREATED LIKE THIS AS A

343
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
AMERICAN MARINE.

344
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS AND WE'LL

345
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
FOLLOW THE STORY.

346
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000

HIS HOT GUN WAS -- I HOPE HE'S

349
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
WATCHING.

350
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
MR. PRESIDENT, THIS IS WHAT

351
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
YOUR COUNTRY IS DOING TO THIS

352
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
PROUD MARINE.

353
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
YOU CRACK DOWN WITH A GUN THAT

354
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
IS 25 OR LESS.

355
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
AND THIS IS 24.

356
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
IT IS ONE INCH LOWER THAN THE

357
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
STANDARD IT IS TRUMPED UP.

358
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000

IN THE 8:00 HOUR.

362
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
THERE IS A HUGE DEBATE IN OUR

363
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
COUNTRY.
>> Brian: JOHN BOEHNER AGREED

364
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
TO TAX HIKES, BUT NOW THE

365
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
PRESIDENT HAS ANOTHER REQUEST.

366
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
WILL THE REPUBLICANS BUY IT.

367
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
MYA LOVE IS ON DECK AND RIGHT

368
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000

BEGIN.

370
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
TOMATO,
OBVIOUSLY.

371
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
HAHA. THERE'S MORE
THAN THAT THOUGH,

372
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
THERE'S A KICK TO IT.
WAHLALALALALLALA!

373
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
SMOOTH, BUT CRISP.

374
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
IT'S KIND OF LIKE DRINKING
A FOOD THAT'S A DRINK,

375
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
OR A DRINK THAT'S A FOOD,
WOOOOOH!

756
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000

823
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
STOPPED SELLING THESE.

824
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000

GET THEIR HANDS ON THE GUNS

827
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
AND MANY PEOPLE THE QUESTION

828
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
WHY DO PEOPLE NEED ASSAULTS IN

829
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
THO THIS COUNTRY.

830
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000

NORTHWEST ARMORY.

837
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
AND KEEP IN MIND THIS IS

838
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
SATURDAY THE DAY AFTER NEWTOWN

839
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
AND IN SOUTHWEST OHIO,

840
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
BUILDING WAS FULL AND THEY HAD

841
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
A LINE OF 400 PEOPLE OUT OF

842
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
THE DOOR.

843
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
KEEP IN MIND THERE WAS A BAND

844
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
THAT WENT INTO AFFECT BACK IN

845
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000

NIGHT ON THE O'REILY SHOW

848
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
WHETHER IT DID MUCH IN THE

849
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
SLOWING DOWN OF THE CARNAGE.

850
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
LISTEN TO THIS.

851
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
>> WE BANNED THEM ONE TIME IN

852
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
1994.
AND LOOK AT THE STUDY ON THE

853
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
BAN THAT WAS DONE IN NINE 99

854
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
AND A UNIVERSITY STUDY PRO GUN

855
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
RIGHTS THOUGHT.

856
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
IT SHOWED IT HAD NO IMPACT ON

857
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
LOWERS HOMICIDE RATES AND NO

858
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
IMPACT ON LOWERS MASS MURDERS

859
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
AND NO IMPACT THAT A VICTIM

860
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
WAS SHOT WITH.

861
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
THE TRUTH DIDN'T WORK.

862
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
WHAT HAPPENED?

863
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
WE HAD A 10 YEAR SUPPLY AND IT

864
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
IS DEBATED ON AND YOU KNOW

865
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
WHEN IT WAS ENACT BECAME

866
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
AFFECTED.
WE'LL SEE THIS, THIS TIME,

867
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
TOO>> Brian: PRESIDENT OBAMA

868
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
WAS TOLD TO COME UP WITH A

869
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
LIST OF PROPOSAL AND WE KNOW

870
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
THAT ANDREW CUOMO HAD A PRESS

871
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
CONFERENCE SENATOR WARNER AND

872
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
SENATOR MANCHIN SAID WE CAN

873
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
LOOK AT REEVALUATING THE

874
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
WEAPONS.

875
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
>> Gretchen: THINGS HAVE

876
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
CHANGED SINCE 1994.

877
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
WE HAVE SEEN MORE MASS

878
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
SHOOTINGS AND I DON'T KNOW IF

879
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
THAT STATISTIC IF I AM LOOKING

880
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
AT IT IF I GO WITH A 1994

881
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
PARTICULAR NOW WE ARE IN 2012.

882
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE

883
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
IF IT WAS ALL ASSAULT WEAPONS

884
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
THRARP USED AND NUMBER THREE

885
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
FOR ME.
EVEN IF YOU ARE FOR GUN

886
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
RIGHTS, IS THERE A DIFFERENCE

887
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
BEING FOR GUN RIGHTS AND

888
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
AGAINST ASSAULT WEAPONS.

889
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
>> Brian: I LOOK AT THE MENTAL

890
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
ILLNESS SEGMENT WITH KEITH

891
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
ABLOW.

892
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
AND WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE OUT

893
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
THERE OR NOT.

894
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
GO DEBATE IT BUT THE MENTAL

895
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
CAPACITY AND THE PEOPLE WHO

896
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
ARE KILLING PEOPLE WITH IT.

897
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
AND THEY ARE TOTALLY

898
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
UNBALANCED.

899
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
>> Gretchen: WHAT DO YOU NEED

900
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS FOR.

901
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
>> Steve: WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

902
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
NUMBER OF RIFLES.

903
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
THERE WERE 12,000 MURDERS LAST

904
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
YEAR.

905
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
HOW MANY WERE COMMITTED WITH

906
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
RIFLES?

907
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
300.

908
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
HOW MANY MASS SHOOTINGS ARE

909
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
DONE WITH ASSAULT.

910
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I DON'T OWN GUNS AND SO I

911
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE USED

912
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
FOR AND I HAVE HEARD THES THAT

913
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
YOU CAN BE PRO GUN AND AGAINST

914
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS.

915
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
AND WHAT DO YOU NEED AN

916
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
ASSAULT WEAPON FOR.

917
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
>> Steve: WHAT DO YOU.

918
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
FRIENDS AT FOX NEWS.COM.

919
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
IS IT TIME TO CHANGELET LAWS

920
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
ON THE BOOKS OR IS THERE LAWS

921
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
THAT ARE NOT USED AS THEY

922
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
SHOULD BE.
>> Brian: THE GOVERNMENT IS

923
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
PUTTING TOGETHER A BILL TO

924
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
HELP SANDY VICTIMS.

925
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
NOT IF THEY ARE PUTTING MONEY

926
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000

BECAME DIFFICULT.

SERIOUS JOINT PAIN IS LIKE.

1206
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I TALKED TO MY RHEUMATOLOGIST
AND HE PRESCRIBED Enbrel.

1207
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Enbrel CAN HELP RELIEVE
PAIN, STIFFNESS,

AND STOP JOINT DAMAGE.

1209
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000

00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
YOUR DOCTOR SHOULD TEST YOU
FOR TUBERCULOSIS

YOU'VE BEEN TO A REGION

01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
CLIFF.
>> Steve: CHRISTMAS IS EXACTLY

1291
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000

1292
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
>> Gretchen: IT'S ANOTHER

1293
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
EMOTIONAL DAY IN NEWTOWN,

WILL BE HELD FOR THE YOUNG

1296
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
VICTIMS OF THAT TRAGEDY.

1297
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
ONE FOR SIX-YEAR-OLD JAMES.

1298
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
HE WAS CALLED JAY.

1299
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
HIS FAMILY SAYS HE LOVED RECESS

1300
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
AND MATH AND CALLED HIM THEIR

1301
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
NUMBERS GUY.

1302
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
THE OTHERS WERE SIX-YEAR-OLD

1303
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000

BROTHERS.
AND AS THE COMMUNITY MOURNS,

01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
STUDENTS AT OTHER NEWTOWN

01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
SCHOOLS WILL HEAD BACK TO CLASS

1309
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000

FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE LAST

1313
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
FOUR DAYS.

1314
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
GOOD MORNING.

1315
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
>> GOOD MORNING, GRETCHEN.

1316
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
AND STUDENTS WHO ESCAPED SANDY

1317
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
HOOK ON FRIDAY WON'T HAVE TO GO

1318
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
BACK TO SCHOOL TODAY AND THEY

1319
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO BACK TO

1320
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
THAT BUILDING, AT LEAST NOT FOR

1321
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
A WHILE.

1322
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
NO TIME THAT ANYBODY WILL

1323
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
CONFIRM TO US.

1324
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
THEY MIGHT NEVER GO BACK.

1325
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
YESTERDAY MOVING TRUCKS WITH

1326
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
POLICE ESCORTS TOOK FURNITURE

1327
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
AND BROUGHT IT TO CHALK HILL

1328
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
MIDDLE SCHOOL.

1329
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
CHALK HILL WAS BUILT IN THE

1330
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
'60S, BUT IT JUST WENT OFF LINE

1331
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
LAST YEAR BECAUSE ATTENDANCE

1332
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
DROPPED.
TO EASE THE TRANSITION FOR THE

1333
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
STUDENTS TO THIS NEW SPACE,

1334
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
OFFICIALS ARE TRYING TO MAKE

1335
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,000
THINGS AS FAMILIAR AS THEY CAN.

1336
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
>> ED SANDY HOOK SCHOOL

1337
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
FURNITURE FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND

1338
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
WILL BE AGE AND WEIGHT

1339
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
APPROPRIATE.
IT'S AN ENORMOUS PROVE.

1340
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
THE HEALING AND BACK TO NORMALCY

1341
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
FEELING THAT WILL HOPEFULLY COME

1342
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
FROM IT IS WORTH EVERY EFFORT.

1343
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
>> PARENTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE

1344
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
ALLOWED TO SEE THE INSIDE OF

1345
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
CHALK HILL BEFORE IT OPENS FOR

1346
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
SECURITY REASONS.

1347
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
BUT WE'RE TOLD THAT WHENEVER IT

1348
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
DOES OPEN, POLICE IN RED

1349
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
JACKETS, SO THAT THEY'RE EASILY

1350
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
IDENTIFIABLE, WILL THEREBY TO

1351
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
CONSOLE STUDENTS BURKS ALSO

1352
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
CHECK I.D.'S AND MAKE SURE THAT

1353
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
THINGS ARE SAFE.

1354
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
WE'RE TOLD THAT THE TIME THAT

1355
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
THE POLICE WILL BE THERE IS OPEN

1356
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
ENDED.
THERE IS NO DATE THEY WILL BE

1357
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
THERE.

1358
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
AS LONG AS IT TAKES FOR PAINTS

1359
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
AND STUDENTS AND TEACHERS TO

1360
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
FEEL COMFORTABLE.

1361
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
WE'RE TOLD THERE IS NO WORD ON

1362
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
WHEN STUDENTS WHO ARE IN SANDY

1363
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
HOOK WILL GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

1364
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I'VE SPOKEN TO SOME PARENTS

1365
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
WHOSE STUDENTS SURVIVED AND THEY

1366
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
THINK IT SHOULD BE AFTER THE

1367
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
HOLIDAY BREAK.

1368
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
BACK TO YOU.

1369
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
>> Steve: PETER, THANK YOU VERY

1370
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
MUCH.
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY ARE

1371
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

1372
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
SECURITY PERSONNEL ARE CLEARLY

1373
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
LABELED SECURITY BECAUSE WE'VE

1374
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
BEEN READING SOME OF THE STORIES

1375
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
ABOUT SOME OF THE CHILDREN WHO

1376
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
WERE IN THE SCHOOL THAT DAY AND

1377
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
DID SURVIVE.

1378
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
EVERY TIME THERE IS A LOUD

1379
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
NOISE, THEY GET FREAKED OUT.

1380
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
WHEN THEY SEE A STRANGER, THEY

1381
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
DON'T KNOW WHY THE STRANGER IS

1382
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
THERE.
EVERYBODY HAS A LEVEL OF ANXIETY

1383
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
THAT IS SO HIGH, IT'S GOOD THAT

1384
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
THEY'RE GOING TO BE GOING TO A

1385
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
SCHOOL AND PICK UP THE PIECES AT

1386
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
CHALK HILL.
BUT LIKE IN THAT STORY THERE,

1387
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
YOU NEED THE APPROPRIATE SIZE

1388
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
FURNITURE.

1389
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
REMEMBER THE LITTLE CHAIRS FOR

1390
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE

1391
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
BECAUSE THIS WAS A MIDDLE

1392
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
SCHOOL.
EVERYTHING IS BIG SIZE.

1393
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
>> Gretchen: WHEN I WENT TO PICK

1394
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
UP MY DAUGHTER YESTERDAY AT

1395
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
SCHOOL, I NOTICED THE EXTRA

1396
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
SECURITY GUARDS AND VERY WELL

1397
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
MARKED WITH YELLOW JACKETS.

1398
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE SHE

1399
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
GOT IN THE CALL AND SAID MOMMY,

1400
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I FEEL SAFE BECAUSE WE HAVE MANY

1401
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
MORE POLICE OFFICERS NOW.

1402
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
IS THAT THE WORLD WE'RE GOING TO

1403
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
LIVE IN NOW, THAT OUR KIDS ARE

1404
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
GOING TO HAVE POLICE OFFICERS

1405
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
OUTSIDE OF THEIR SCHOOLS ON A

1406
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
FULL-TIME BASIS?

1407
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT.

1408
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
>> Brian: FOUR MINUTES AFTER THE

1409
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
HOUR.

1410
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
LET'S TALK ABOUT ONE TEACHER WE

1411
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
TOUCHED ON YESTERDAY.

1412
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
27 YEARS OLD, SINGLE WOMAN WHO

1413
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
DID HEROIC THINGS.

1414
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
FOR EXAMPLE, IN HER CLASSROOM

1415
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
WHEN SHE HEARD THE CLASSROOM

1416
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
ACROSS THE HALL, EVIDENTLY THE

1417
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
GUNMAN CAME IN TO HER AND THEY

1418
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
SAID R ARE THE KIDS?

1419
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
SHE SAID DOWN THE HALL AT THE

1420
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
AUDITORIUM, AT WHICH TIME WE

1421
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
UNDERSTAND SOP OF THE KIDS WHO

1422
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
WERE HIDING IN CLOSET RAN OUT.

1423
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
THE GUNMAN WENT TO SHOOT THE

1424
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
CHILDREN.
SHE DOVE IN FRONT OF THEM AND AT

1425
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
THAT TIME, SHE PROBABLY SAVED

1426
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
HALF THE STUDENTS?

1427
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
HER CLASS.

1428
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
HALF DID LOSE THEIR LIVES,

1429
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
INCLUDING JACK, WHO YOU SAW PUT

1430
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
TO REST YESTERDAY.

1431
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
THOSE SIX KIDS, WHERE DID THEY

1432
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
GO AS THEY RAN OUT?

1433
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
IT TURNS OUT WE KNOW EXACTLY

1434
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
WHERE THEY WENT.

1435
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
REAL QUICK B THAT HEROIC

1436
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
TEACHER?
WE TALKED TO THAT TEACHER'S

1437
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
ROOMMATE WHEN THEY WERE BOTH

1438
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
FELLOW TEACHERS AS THEY WERE IN

1439
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
COLLEGE TOGETHER.

1440
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
LET'S LISTEN.

1441
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
>> SHE LOVED HER JOB AND SHE

1442
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
LOVED THEM AND I WAS NOT AT ALL

1443
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
SURPRISED SHE WOULD DO THIS,

1444
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
THAT SHE WOULD PROTECT THEM AND

1445
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
GIVE HER LIFE TO SAVE THEIRS.

1446
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
HEART BREAKING, BUT I KNEW

1447
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
THAT'S VICKY.

1448
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
THAT'S WHAT SHE WOULD DO.

1449
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
THESE KIDS WERE HER LIFE.

1450
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
>> Steve: THEY BOTH GRADUATED --

1451
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
THAT WAS A YOUNG WOMAN NAMED

1452
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
KRISTEN.
THEY BOTH GRADUATED IN 2008 FROM

1453
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
EASTERN CONNECTICUT STATE

1454
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
UNIVERSITY.

1455
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
BEING A TEACHER IS ALL THAT

1456
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
VICKY SOTO EVER WANTED TO DO.

1457
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
HER SISTER, CAYLEE WAS FEATURED

1458
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
IN NEWSPAPERS ALL ACROSS THE

1459
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
COUNTRY.
YOU SEE THAT PICTURE STANDING

1460
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.
SHE IS ON THE PHONE.

1461
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
SHE DOES NOT KNOW FOR SURE

1462
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
WHETHER OR NOT HER SISTER --

1463
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
DOESN'T KNOW IF HER SISTER VICKY

1464
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
IS DEAD OR ALIVE.

1465
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
SHE'S SIMPLY BEGGING FOR

1466
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
INFORMATION.
SHE SAYS SEEING THAT PHOTO, IT'S

1467
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
LIKE REMINDER OF THAT MOMENT ALL

1468
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
OVER.

1469
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
IT KILLS.

1470
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
>> Gretchen: BRIAN WAS JUST
ALLUDING TO WHERE THE SIX

1471
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
CHILDREN ENDED UP WHO MANAGED TO

1472
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
ESCAPE.
JEAN ROSEN HAD BEEN OUT FOR

1473
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
BREAKFAST.
CAME HOME TO HIS HOUSE.

1474
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
HERE HE IS FINDING OUT ABOUT THE

1475
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
TRAGIC NEWS AND SEES THESE SIX

1476
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
CHILDREN STANDING ON HIS LAWN.

1477
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
HE THOUGHT THEY WERE PART OF A

1478
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
SCHOOL PLAY, MAYBE IT WAS A SKIT

1479
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
THEY WERE DOING.

1480
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
SUDDENLY THE KIDS WERE CRYING
ASK TELLING HIM OUR TEACHER IS

1481
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
DEAD.

1482
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
WE CAN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

1483
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
WHAT DID HE DO?

1484
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
HE BROUGHT THEM INSIDE HIS HOME

1485
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
FOR SAFETY.

1486
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
EVENTUALLY A SCHOOL BUS DRIVER

1487
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
CAME IN, ABLE TO HELP HIM

1488
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
IDENTIFY THE CHILDREN, GAVE THEM

1489
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
JUICE AND STUFFED ANIMALS.

1490
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
CALLED THEIR PARENTS.

1491
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
THE SADDEST PART TO ME ABOUT

1492
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
THIS STORY IS THAT LATER ON, A

1493
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
PARENT CAME TO HIS HOUSE AND

1494
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
SAID, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE

1495
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
SOME CHILDREN HERE WHO SURVIVED.

1496
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
WAS MY CHILD HERE?

1497
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
AND HE, UNFORTUNATELY H TO TELL

1498
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
HER NO.
>> Steve: THERE IS ONE OTHER

1499
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
STORY THAT I SAW THIS MORNING IN

1500
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
THE STORY REGARDING VICKY SOTO.

1501
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
THAT IS HER TEACHER'S AIDE,

1502
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
52-YEAR-OLD WOMAN NAMED ANN

1503
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
MARIE MURPHY.

1504
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
WHEN THE SHOOTING STARTED, SHE

1505
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
GRABBED ONE OF THE KIDS AND, IN

1506
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
FACT, DYLAN HOCKNY, WAS FOUND IN

1507
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
HER ARMS, AND THE FAMILY ISSUED

1508
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
A STATEMENT -- DYLAN WAS

1509
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
AUTISTIC AS ADAM LANZA WAS.

1510
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
DYLAN'S FAMILY ISSUED A

1511
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
STATEMENT YESTERDAY.

1512
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
WE TAKE GREAT COMFORT IN KNOWING

1513
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
THAT DYLAN WAS NOT ALONE WHEN HE

1514
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
DIED, BUT WAS WRAPPED IN THE

1515
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
ARMS OF HIS AMAZING AIDE, ANN

1516
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
MARIE MURPHY.

1517
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
>> Brian: WHAT THOSE KIDS SAW,

1518
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
IT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC

1519
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE DO KNOW

1520
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
ONE OF THE KIDS SAID, THE MAN

1521
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
CAME INTO OUR CLASSROOM AND HE

1522
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
HAD A BIG GUN AND A LITTLE GUN.

1523
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
SO IT LOOKS LIKE THEY RAN AFTER

1524
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
SEEING HIM AND WE KNOW THAT

1525
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE

1526
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
WHO SURVIVED AFTER BEING SHOT.

1527
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
THEY PROBABLY WILL HAVE MORE OF

1528
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
THESE STORIES.

1529
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
>> Gretchen: ONE OF THE BIG

1530
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
TOPICS OF DISCUSSION IS MENTAL

1531
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
ILLNESS AND HOW WE HANDLE IT IN

1532
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
THIS SOCIETY AND WHETHER WE'RE

1533
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
DOING ENOUGH.

1534
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
PRETTY MUCH THE ANSWER FOR THAT

1535
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
IS PROBABLY NO.

1536
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
ONE MOM DECIDED VERY BRAVELY TO

1537
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
WRITE A BLOG ABOUT HER PERSONAL

TO RETURN HIS OVERDUE LIBRARY

1561

HE IS SEVEN AND NINE-YEAR-OLD

ANOTHER NATIONAL TRAGEDY.

IT'S EASY TO TALK ABOUT GUN, BUT

1579
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
IT'S TIME TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL

1580
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
ILLNESS.
HOW DO YOU GET ADDITIONAL HELP

01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000

HAD NEVER BEEN ARRESTED FOR A

SITUATIONS IN OUR SOCIETY NOW,

1601
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I'M THINKING ABOUT DOMESTIC

1602

VIOLENCE.
UNTIL SOMEBODY DOES SOMETHING OR

1603
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000

HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE

1610
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
ARE SIMPLY NOT MANY OPTIONS FOR

01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
WEARING SKI MASKS JUMPED OUT AND

1621
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
PULLED THEM OUT OF THEIR CAR.

1624
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000

1639
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
LITERALLY JUMPED OUT OF THE

01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
THEY HAD A CONTAINER TRUCK

1647
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
POSITIONED WAITING BY THE SIDE

1648
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
OF THE ROAD.

1649
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
THEY PUT US INTO THAT CONTAINER

1650
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
TRUCK.

1651
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
WE WERE WITH SOME GUNMEN, REBELS

1652
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
WHO WERE ESCORTING US.

1653
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
THEY EXECUTED ONE ON THE.  SO

1654
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
THEN TOOK US TO A SERIES OF SAFE

1655
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
HOUSES AND INTERROGATION PLACES

1656
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
AND THEY KEPT US BLINDFOLDED,

1657
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
BOUND.
WE WEREN'T PHYSICALLY BEATEN OR

1658
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
TORTURED.
LOT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURED.

1659

1660
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
WOULD BRING THOME A HEZBOLLAH

1695
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
HI, ROBERT.
>> GOOD MORNING TO YOU AND GOOD

1696
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
MORNING, EVERYBODY.

1697
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
WE'RE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF

1698
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
NEWTOWN AMIDST A GROWING

1699
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
MEMORIAL FOR THE VICTIMS HERE OF

1700
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
FRIDAY'S SHOOTING.

1701
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
POLICE SAY THEY HAVE SEIZED A

1702
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE

1703
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
FROM THE HOME THAT 20-YEAR-OLD

1704
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
ADAM LANZA SHARED WITH HIS

1705
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
MOTHER, NANCY, IN NEWTOWN.

1706
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
WHILE POLICE WOULD NOT

1707
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
OFFICIALLY SPECIFY WHAT THAT

1708
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
EVIDENCE IS, REPORTS SAY THAT

1709
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
ONE PIECE OF EVIDENCE INCLUDE

1710
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
HAS COMPUTER HARD DRIVE SEVERELY

1711
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
DAMAGED FOR SOME REASON.

1712
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
SO POLICE ARE FACING A CHALLENGE

1713
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
GETTING USEFUL INFORMATION OFF

1714
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
OF THAT HARD DRIVE.

1715
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
ALSO YESTERDAY, POLICE TOLD US

1716
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
THAT ACTUALLY TWO PEOPLE

1717
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
SURVIVED THE SHOOTING INSIDE

1718
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND

1719
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
NOT JUST ONE PERSON, AS

1720
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.

1721
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
ANOTHER MISCONCEPTION THAT

1722
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
POLICE CLEARED UP WAS THAT IT

1723
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
APPEARS AS THOUGH ADAM LANZA HAD

1724
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
NO CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL.

1725
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
YOU'LL RECALL THAT THERE WERE

1726
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
SOME INITIAL REPORTS THAT EITHER

1727
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
HIS MOTHER WAS A TEACH THERE ARE

1728
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
OR HE ATTENDED THERE.

1729
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
BUT POLICE SAY LANZA DID NOT

1730
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
HAVE ANY APPARENT CONNECTION TO

1731
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1732
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
ALSO WE'RE LEARNING THIS

1733
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
MORNING, ACCORDING TO THE

1734
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
DANBURY NEWS TIMES, RIGHT NOW

1735
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
POLICE HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT

1736
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
ADAM LANZA HAD ANY SORT OF

1737
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION FOR

1738
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
MENTAL ILLNESS, BUT THAT WILL BE

1739
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
PART OF THIS INVESTIGATION.

1740
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
AN INVESTIGATION WE'RE TOLD THAT

1741
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
COULD LAST WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS.

1742
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
THAT IS THE LATEST, LIVE FROM

1743
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT THIS

1744
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
MORNING, ROBERT MOSES, FOX NEWS.

1745
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
BACK TO YOU.

1746
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
>> Gretchen: WOW.
LOOK AT ALL THOSE FLOWERS AROUND

1747
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
ROBERT IN TRIBUTE TO ALL OF

1748
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
THOSE CHILDREN AND ADULTS

1749
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
KILLED.

1750
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
THANKS, ROBERT.

1751
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
STEVE?
>> Steve: THANKS.

1752
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
SO WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF GUN

1753
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
CONTROL IN THE UNITED STATES?

1754
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST PETER

1755
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
JOHNSON, JR. IS HERE WITH

1756
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
ANALYSIS.
WE ALREADY HAVE GUN CONTROL.

1757
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
>> WE DO HAVE GUN CONTROL AND

1758
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
SOME PEOPLE SAY WE NEED MORE GUN

1759
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
CONTROL.
WE NEED MICRO STAMPING OF GUNS.

1760
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
WE NEED THE ABILITY THAT EACH

1761
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
TIME GUNS ARE PURCHASED, THAT

1762
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
THERE BE REGISTRATION AND FOR

1763
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
EACH PARTICULAR FIREARM THAT'S

1764
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
PURCHASED, THE DISCUSSION OF

1765
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
ACROSS STATE LAWS PURCHASING,

1766
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
BRINGING FIREARMS.
BUT IT'S A BIGGER QUESTION THAN

1767
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
GUN CONTROL.

1768
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
THE WHITE HOUSE WILL PROBABLY

1769
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
FRAME IT IN THE CONTEXT OF GUN

1770
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
CONTROL.
IS VIOLENCE THE PRICE OF OUR

1771
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
FREEDOM?
I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN

1772
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
APPROPRIATE QUESTION.

1773
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
THE QUESTION IS WHAT

1774
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
CONVERSATION DO WE HAVE OUTSIDE

1775
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
OF THE INTEREST GROUPS, OUTSIDE

1776
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
OF THE POWER LOBBYING GROUPS ON

1777
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
ALL SIDES, WHETHER IT'S PRO GUN,

1778
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
ANTIGUN, WHETHER IT'S THE

1779
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY?

1780
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY,

1781
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
THROUGH SOME BLOGGER, WENT AFTER

1782
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
ME YESTERDAY.
THAT'S A POWERFUL LOBBY.

1783
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
$17 BILLION A YEAR!

1784
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
ARE WE WILLING TO ALLOW OUR

1785
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
FUTURE AND OUR DECISION MAKING

1786
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
TO BE IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE

1787
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
THAT ARE GIVING MONEY TO

1788
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
CONGRESS?

1789
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
SO I SAY PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT

1790
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
UNDER THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO

1791
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
OWN FIREARMS.

1792
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
>> Steve: INDEED.

1793
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
>> THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RIGHT

1794
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
TO REGISTER AND REGULATE THOSE

1795
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
FIREARMS.
AT THE SAME TIME, WE NEED TO BE

1796
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
THINKING ABOUT WHERE SHOULD WE

1797
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
BE ALLOCATING LAW ENFORCEMENT

1798
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
RESOURCES?

1799
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
HOW CAN WE BETTER REGISTER?

1800
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
HOW CAN ENTERTAINMENT STOP WITH

1801
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
THE CULTURE OF DEATH IN TERMS OF

1802
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
VIDEOS?
SO THERE IS A BIG, BIG

1803
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
DISCUSSION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

1804
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
AT THIS PLACE, AT THE COUCH, IN

1805
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
TOWN HALLS ACROSS AMERICA, JUST

1806
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
LIKE WE DID WITH OBAMACARE, JUST

1807
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
LIKE WE'VE DONE WITH OTHER

1808
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
ISSUES IN OUR HISTORY.

1809
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT THEY

1810
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
WANT GOING FORWARD.

1811
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
>> Steve: BUT YOU WANT TO SEE

1812
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
THE PEOPLE DECIDE AND TRY TO

1813
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
EXCLUDE THE LOBBYISTS WHO HAVE A

1814
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
LOT OF MONEY.

1815
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
>> THE LOBBYIST ALSO ALWAYS BE

1816
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
THERE.
THEY HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

1817
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
MONEY.

1818
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
THEY INSTILL FEAR IN THE HEARTS

1819
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
OF OUR CONGRESS.

1820
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
ON EVERY SIDE OF THE ISSUE.

1821
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
BUT IT'S ABOUT US AND IT'S ABOUT

1822
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
OUR CHILDREN.

1823
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
AND WE OWE IT TO OUR CHILDREN

1824
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
WHO ARE LIVING.

1825
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
WE OWE IT TO THESE CHILDREN WHO

1826
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
DIED.
WE OWE IT TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO

1827
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
HAVE DIED IN MASS VIOLENCE.

1828
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
LET'S LOOK AT AK 47S AND AR 15S.

1829
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
THE NUMBERS SHOW THAT IT'S A

1830
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
SMALL PORTION OF THE DEATHS AND

1831
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
VIOLENCE IN AMERICA.

1832
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
BUT IT'S A HIGH PORTION, IT'S A

1833
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
HIGH PROPORTION OF THE MASS

1834
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
VIOLENCE EPISODES.

1835
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
LET'S LOOK AT EVERYTHING IN A

1836
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
DISPASSIONATE, SMART, OBJECTIVE

1837
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
WAY THAT FORGETS AMERICANS AND

1838
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
PROTECTS THE CONSTITUTION, BOTH.

1839
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
>> Steve: IT'S A CONVERSATION

1840
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
THAT STARTED ON FRIDAY.

1841
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
>> ABSOLUTELY HAS.

1842
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
>> Steve: ALL RIGHT.

1843
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
PETER JOHNSON, JR.
THANK YOU.

1844
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
NEXT UP, A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN

1845
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
THE FIGHT AGAINST CANCER.

1846
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
COULD BE IN YOUR REFRIGERATOR

1847
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
RIGHT NOW.

1848
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
AND THIS WOMAN GIVEN MONTHS TO

1849
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
LIVE.

1850
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
NOW WILL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS

1851
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
AFTER THREE ORGAN TRANSPLANTS.

1852
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
THE MIRACLE MOM IS HERE LIVE

1853
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,000
NEXT

1854
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
>> Brian: THE PRESIDENT OF IRAQ

1855
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
IN A COMA AFTER HAVING A STROKE.

1856
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
DOCTORS UPDATING HIS CONDITION,

1857
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
SAYING HE'S CRITICAL, BUT

1858
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
STABLE.

1859
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
THEY HAVE NOT DECIDED IF HE WILL

1860
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
STAY IN BAGHDAD OR NOT, OR HE'LL

1861
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
BE FLOWN TO ANOTHER COUNTRY FOR

1862
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
TREATMENT.

1863
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
HE'S 79 YEARS OLD AND NEVER

1864
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
REALLY IN THAT GOOD OF SHAPE.

1865
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
MAJOR NIDAL MALIK HASAN GOING

1866
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
BEFORE A NEW MILITARY JUDGE

1867
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
TODAY.
THE JUDGE COULD DECIDE TO

1868
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
REVISIT EVERY RULING HER

1869
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
PREDECESSOR MADE OVER THE LAST

1870
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
17 MONTHS OF HEARINGS.

1871
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
THE TRIAL HAS BEEN DELAYED OVER

1872
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR THE

1873
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
PAST THREE YEARS.

1874
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
THE LAST DELAY WAS OVER DEMANDS

1875
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
THAT HASAN BE FORCED TO SHAVE

1876
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
HIS BEARD.

1877
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
GRETCHEN?

1878
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
>> Gretchen: THANK YOU, BRIAN.

1879
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
FROM THE DAY SHE WAS BORN, OUR

1880
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
NEXT GUEST HAS BEEN CALLED A

1881
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
MEDICAL MIRACLE.

1882
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
STEPHANIE WAS BORN WITH

1883
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE.

1884
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
DOCTORS TOLD HER PARENTS SHE

1885
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
WOULDN'T LIVE PAST THE AGE OF

1886
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
TEN.
GUESS WHAT?

1887
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
SHE JUST TURNED 38 ON SUNDAY AND

1888
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
STEPHANIE HAS BEEN MARRIED FOR

1889
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
14 YEARS, HAS TWO BEAUTIFUL

1890
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
CHILDREN AND THIS RECENTLY

1891
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
SURVIVED -- SHE RECENTLY

1892
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
SURVIVED A TRIPLE ORGAN

1893
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
TRANSPLANT.
THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE

1894
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
STATE OF GEORGIA.

1895
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
JOINING ME FOR A GOOD NEWS STORY

1896
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
TODAY, THE MIRACLE MOM,

1897
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
STEPHANIE LYNNSTROM.

1898
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

1899
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
>> GOOD MORNING, GRETCHEN.

1900
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
>> Gretchen: WOW.

1901
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
HOW FANTASTIC THAT YOU ARE GOING

1902
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
TO BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS WITH

1903
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
YOUR HUSBAND AND YOUR TWO YOUNG

1904
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
CHILDREN.

1905
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
>> I KNOW.

1906
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I WAS AFRAID THAT I WOULDN'T

1907
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
EVEN MAKE IT HOME BY CHRISTMAS

1908
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:08,000
AND THEY RELEASED ME OCTOBER 23

1909
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
WITH SOME FREQUENT CHECKUPS

1910
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
EVERY MONTH OR SO.

1911
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
I USUALLY TALK TO MY

1912
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
COORDINATORS EVERY WEEK.

1913
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
BUT IT SURE BEATS BEING IN THE

1914
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
HOSPITAL FOR SO LONG.

1915
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
>> Gretchen: NO DOUBT.

1916
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
THIS SUMMER IN JULY THEY WERE

1917
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
TELLING YOU THAT YOU WERE GOING

1918
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
TO DIE.
YOUR FAMILY ACTUALLY CAME AND

1919
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
SAID THEIR GOOD-BYES TO YOU.

1920
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
WHAT HAPPENED?

1921
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,000
>> THEY DID.

1922
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
JULY 4, DR. BRIAN COGGEN TALKED

1923
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
TO MY HUSBAND AND MY PARENTS AND

1924
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
SAID THAT I HAD A COUPLE OF

1925
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,000
DAYS, UP TO A WEEK, THAT IF

1926
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
THINGS DID NOT TURN AROUND, IF I

1927
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
DIDN'T GET THE ORGANS, THAT HE

1928
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
WOULD BE HAVING A SERIOUS TALK

1929
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:53,000
WITH MY HUSBAND, JOEL.

1930
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
AND TWO DAYS LATER, THE ORGANS

1931
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
CAME IN.

1932
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
SO I TRULY BELIEVE THAT'S FROM

1933
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
GOD AND HE JUST GAVE ME A

1934
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
MIRACLE.

1935
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
SO JULY 7 AND 8 IS WHEN I

1936
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
RECEIVED THE HEART, THE LIVER

1937
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
AND THE KIDNEY.

1938
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
>> Gretchen: WOW.
SO YOU WERE BORN WITH A

1939
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
CONGENITAL HEART DEFECT.

1940
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
BUT YOU EVENTUALLY NEED TO HAVE

1941
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
THOSE OTHER ORGANS.

1942
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
WHY?

1943
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
>> WELL, OVER THE YEARS, THEY

1944
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
PERFORMED FOUR SURGERIES IN MY

1945
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
CHILDHOOD THAT WERE MEDICALLY

1946
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
NECESSARY BECAUSE I HAD ONE

1947
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
BOTTOM CHAMBER OF MY HEART.

1948
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
ONE VENTRICLE.

1949
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
SO IT WAS A CORRECT PROCEDURE,

1950
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
BUT THEY FOUND OVER THE YEARS

1951
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
THAT THOSE PROCEDURES GAVE EXTRA

1952
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
STRESS TO THE LIVER.

1953
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
AND WITH ALL LIFETIME OF

1954
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
MEDICINES AND TOXICITY BUILD-UP

1955
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
IN THE LIVER.

1956
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
SO THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT WHEN MY

1957
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
GENERATION WAS A KID, BUT THEY

1958
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
FOUND IT IN PEOPLE IN THEIR 30S,

1959
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,000
40S AND 50S NOW THAT THEY ARE

1960
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
GOING STRAIGHT TO HEART AND

1961
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
LIVER TRANSPLANTS AS THE LAST

1962
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
TREATMENT OPTION.

1963
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
AND BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN IN THE O

1964
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
HAVE KIDNEY FAILURE WITH HAVING

1965
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
DIALYSIS FOR TWO MONTHS PRIOR TO

1966
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
THES ORGAN.

1967
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
SO I DID HAVE THREE SYSTEMS

1968
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
FAILING.
>> Gretchen: YOU ARE A MEDICAL

1969
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
MIRACLE RIGHT NOW.

1970
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS BEEN

1971
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
DONE IN GEORGIA WHERE YOU HAD

1972
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
THESE THREE ORGANS TRANSPLANTED

1973
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
AT THE SAME TIME.

1974
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
>> YES.
>> Gretchen: AS YOU LOOK FORWARD

1975
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
TO CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR, AND

1976
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
WE'VE BEEN SEEING THESE

1977
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
BEAUTIFUL PHOTOS OF YOU WITH

1978
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
YOUR HUSBAND AND BEAUTIFUL

1979
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
CHILDREN, FOUR AND SIX WHAT, IS

1980
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
YOUR CHRISTMAS MESSAGE TO PEOPLE

1981
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
WHO ARE WATCHING THIS MORNING?

1982
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,000
>> I THINK IF YOU CAN LEARN

1983
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
ANYTHING, THAT GOD HAS CREATED

1984
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
ME, CREATED MY BODY AND FOR SOME

1985
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
PURPOSE, I HOPE IT'S TO GIVE HIM

1986
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
GLORY AND TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE

1987
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
IN HEALTH CRISIS, THAT LIFE'S

1988
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
NOT FAIR AND YOU CAN PICK UP THE

1989
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
PIECES AND DO THE BEST YOU CAN

1990
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
WITH WHAT YOU HAVE.

1991
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I ALSO ENCOURAGE DONATING

1992
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
ORGANS, OF COURSE.

1993
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
PEOPLE ARE DYING DAILY WAITING

1994
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,000
FOR ORGANS AND THAT COULD HAVE

1995
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
BEEN AND WOULD HAVE BEEN ME.

1996
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
>> Gretchen: THAT'S RIGHT.

1997
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
>> I'M JUST SO THANKFUL.

1998
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I DON'T TAKE THINGS FOR GRANTED

1999
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
ANYMORE AT ALL.

2000
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
>> Gretchen: OF COURSE NOT.

2001
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
>> TIME WITH THE KIDS AND JOEL.

2002
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
>> Gretchen: AFTER DOING SO MANY
OF THESE STORIES MYSELF, I'M

2003
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
ALSO AN ORGAN DONOR ON MY

2004
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
DRIVER'S LICENSE.

2005
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000

02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,000
>> Steve: LET'S DEAL IN LAURA
INGRAHAM WHO JOINSES FROM OUR

2900
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,000
NATION'S CAPITOL.

2901
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

2902
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.

2903
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:11,000
I'M FROM CONNECTICUT, UP THE

2904
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,000
ROAD FROM NEWTOWN.

2905
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
BUT I KNOW THAT TOWN VERY WELL

2906
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
AND IT'S AN IDYLLIC PLACE WITH

2907
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,000
GREAT PEOPLE AND WE'VE SEEN SOME

2908
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:23,000
AMAZING EXAMPLES OF COMPASSION,

2909
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,000
KINDNESS AND NEIGHBOR HELPING

2910
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
NEIGHBOR AND I HOPE THAT OF THE

2911
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,000
STORIES THAT YOU'RE TELLING

2912
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
TODAY, THE MEMORIES OF THESE

2913
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,000
YOUNG PEOPLE, WHAT THEY BROUGHT

2914
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
TO THE COMMUNITY, I HOPE THAT'S

2915
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
WHAT WE FOCUS ON BECAUSE THAT IS

2916
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,000
THE SPIRIT OF THE SEASON AND NOT

2917
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
THE FREAK THAT COMMITTED THESE

2918
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,000
ACTS.
>> Steve: THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

2919
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
DEMOCRAT LAW MAKERS WHO ALREADY

2920
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
ARE CALLING FOR STRICTER GUN

2921
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
CONTROLS.
WE'VE GOT LOTS OF GUN LAWS ON

2922
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,000
THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW.

2923
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,000
BUT YOU SEE THE STATISTICS AND

2924
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
IT LOOKS LIKE IN STATES LIKE

2925
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
CALIFORNIA AND OHIO AND

2926
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,000
COLORADO, PEOPLE ARE BUYING

2927
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
THESE AR 15 RIFLES AS QUICKLY AS

2928
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,000
THEY CAN 'CAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID

2929
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
THE GOVERNMENT WILL STEP IN AND

2930
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT

2931
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
THEMSELVES.
>> YEAH.

2932
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
I THINK THIS HAPPENS A LOT.

2933
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,000
IT HAPPENED IN THE AFTERMATH OF

2934
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,000
THE ELECTION, TOO.

2935
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
PEOPLE ASSUME THAT WHEN

2936
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS RELIE

2937
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
DETECTORRED, THERE WOULD BE SOME

2938
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
TYPE OF NEW GUN INITIATIVE ON

2939
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,000
THE BOOKS.

2940
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
SO PEOPLE WENT OUT AND BOUGHT

2941
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
GUNS THEN.

2942
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:19,000
LOOK, I COME FROM A FAMILY OF

2943
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,000
PEOPLE WHO WENT HUNTING AND GUN

2944
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:24,000
CLUB MEMBERS AND SO FORTH IN

2945
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
CONNECTICUT.
MY FAMILY WAS ALWAYS VERY

2946
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
CAREFUL ABOUT GUN SAFETY AND

2947
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
THAT'S JUST THE WAY WE WERE

2948
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
BROUGHT UP.
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN TEXAS.

2949
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
PEOPLE I KNOW THERE, BIG GUN

2950
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
OWNERS, BIG INTO GUN SAFETY.

2951
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
>> Gretchen: WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
HERE IF IT'S NOT -- IS IT THAT

2952
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS ARE NOT

2953
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,000
BEING ENFORCED?

2954
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
IS IT THAT -- SHOULD THERE BE

2955
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,000
ANY LIMIT ON SOME OF THE WEAPONS

2956
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:48,000
THAT ARE SOLD?

2957
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,000
SHOULD WE HAVE MORE BACKGROUND

2958
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,000
CHECKS?

2959
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
ALL THESE GUNS THAT THIS GUY HAD

2960
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
WERE LEGAL.

2961
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
SO PEOPLE ARE LEFT WITH A BUNCH

2962
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,000
OF QUESTIONS IN THEIR MINDS.

2963
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,000
>> YEAH.

2964
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
I THINK IT'S A BIG AND

2965
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
COMPLICATED QUESTION, RIGHT?
I THINK THERE'S A CULTURAL

2966
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,000
PROBLEM WE HAVE.

2967
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
I THINK WE HAVE -- WE DON'T KNOW

2968
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
ENOUGH ABOUT HIS FAMILY.

2969
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I KNOW THEY'VE BEEN VILIFIED

2970
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS.

2971
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
"WASHINGTON POST" HAS AN EVEN

2972
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:12,000
HANDED STORY ABOUT HIS FAMILY

2973
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
TODAY ON TRYING TO LOOK AT THIS

2974
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:18,000
A LITTLE BIT LESS -- IN A VERY

2975
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,000
KIND OF OUTRAGED FASHION WHICH

2976
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
PEOPLE ARE.

2977
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
BUT LOOK, I DON'T THINK IN A

2978
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
FIVE-MINUTE SEGMENT WE CAN

2979
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

2980
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,000
I THINK EVERYONE IS TRYING TO

2981
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,000
PIECE IT TOGETHER.

2982
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
BUT TO SAY THAT IF THERE WAS AN

2983
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN IN PLACE

2984
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED, I

2985
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,000
THINK THAT MIGHT MAKE US FEEL

2986
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,000
BETTER, BUT I DON'T SEE THAT

2987
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
ANYTHING THAT I'M READING

2988
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
INDICATES THAT THAT WOULD HAVE

2989
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,000
HAPPENED.

2990
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN

2991
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
COLUMBINE.
NO ASSAULT WEAPONS USED THERE.

2992
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:47,000
WE KNOW THAT OUT OF 12,664

2993
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:51,000
KILLINGS OVER THE LAST YEAR, 323

2994
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
WERE COMMITTED WITH A RIFLE OR A

2995
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
SHOTGUN.

2996
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
OKAY?

2997
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,000
SO AS RICH LOURY POINTED OUT IN

2998
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
THE NATIONAL REVIEW, EVEN IF

2999
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
PEOPLE RUSHED FORWARD AND HAD

3000
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
THIS QUOTE, ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN,

3001
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR THIS WOULD STOP

3002
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
THESE TYPES OF KILLINGS.

3003
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,000
THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER WEAPONS

3004
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
THAT CAN BE USED AND UNLESS YOU

3005
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
REALLY WANT TO GO FOR AN ALL-OUT

3006
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,000
GUN BAN IN THE UNITED STATES,

3007
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
WHICH IS NOT GOING TO PASS

3008
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:17,000
CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER, WE

3009
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,000
HAVE -- WE'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE

3010
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,000
THIS PROBLEM.

3011
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
I UNDERSTAND THE IMPULSE, BUT

3012
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE

3013
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
PROBLEM.
>> Brian: SO THIS HAPPENS,

3014
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
AURORA HAPPENS, GABBY GIFFORDS

3015
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,000
GETS SHOT, OTHERS DIE.

3016
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
IF YOU WERE IN CHARGE, WHAT

3017
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
SHOULD WE LEARN FROM THIS

3018
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY?

3019
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
LET'S JUST BEEF UP SCHOOL

3020
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
SECURITY AND REIN IN THE VIDEO

3021
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
GAMES?

3022
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,000
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WE SHOULD

3023
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:41,000
TAKE FROM THIS?

3024
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S A HARD

3025
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
CALL.
I THINK THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT

3026
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
BANNING CERTAIN TYPES OF

3027
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,000
MAGAZINES.

3028
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:50,000
BUT WE KNOW MAGAZINES ALSO JAM.

3029
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:53,000
WHEN THEY JAM, OFTENTIMES THE

3030
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
PERPETRATOR ARE TACKLED AND

3031
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,000
CAPTURED.

3032
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
TO ME THAT, WOULD BE A SMARTER

3033
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
WAY TO GO THAN TO SAY OH, THIS

3034
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,000
TYPE OF WEAPON.

3035
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
PEOPLE CAN DO A LOT OF DAMAGE

3036
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,000
WITH TEN ROUNDS AND A GLOCK .9

3037
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,000
MILLIMETER.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE BANNED IN

3038
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,000
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

3039
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
>> Gretchen: WHAT ABOUT THESE

3040
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
VIDEO GAMES?

3041
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,000
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK
ABOUT THE FACT THAT KIDS ARE

3042
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
ACTUALLY EXPERIENCING WHAT IT

3043
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,000
FEELS LIKE TO MURDER SOMEBODY

3044
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,000
WHEN THEY PLAY THESE GAMES.

3045
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,000
>> RIGHT.

3046
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
>> Gretchen: I HAVE TO TELL YOU

3047
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,000
THAT I MADE A DECISION AFTER

3048
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
THIS HAPPENED FRIDAY TO NOT BUY

3049
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
A SPECIFIC VIDEO KIND OF PIECE

3050
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
OF EQUIPMENT FOR MY CHILD THAT

3051
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
EVENTUALLY HE COULD GET THOSE

3052
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
KINDS OF GAMES FOR.

3053
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
IT CHANGED MY MIND PERSONALLY

3054
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,000
ABOUT IT.

3055
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,000
IS THAT THE ANSWER?

3056
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,000
IS IT A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE?

3057
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
IS IT ALL THOSE THINGS?

3058
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,000
>> I THINK IS THIS YOUNG MAN WAS

3059
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000
OBVIOUSLY SUFFERING FROM

3060
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:46,000
SOMETHING.
I MEAN, I LOOK AT IT AND I SEE

3061
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
EVIL.
I SEE DEMONIC.

3062
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
PEOPLE AREN'T USING THE WORD

3063
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
DEMONIC, BUT I FIND IT TO BE

3064
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,000
DEMONIC, WHAT HAPPENED TO THESE

3065
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:56,000
CHILDREN, AND THE IDEA THAT

3066
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,000
FAMILIES, GROWING UP AND RAISING

3067
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
THIS BOY AND SOMEHOW YOU CAN

3068
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
HAVE WEAPONS IN THE HOME WITH

3069
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
THIS BOY IN THE HOME, A YOUNG

3070
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
MAN, HE'S 20 YEARS OLD, THAT

3071
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
OBVIOUSLY HAS REAL PROBLEMS, I

3072
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

3073
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THERE

3074
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
WERE WEAPONS IN THAT HOME WITH

3075
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,000
THE WAY HE'S BEING DESCRIBED.

3076
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
TO ME, THAT SEEMS UNBELIEVABLE.

3077
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

3616
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:43,000
NEW DEVELOPMENTS OVERNIGHT AS

LAWMAKERS RACE TO AVOID NOW THE

3618
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:45,000
FISCAL CLIFF.

3619
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:46,000
SO WE GOT WORD THAT THE

3620
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE MAYBE

3621
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:49,000
GIVING IT A LITTLE GROUND, TRY

3622
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:50,000
AND MAKE A DEAL.

3623
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:51,000
BUT WILL THE SUDDEN SHIFT BE

3624
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:55,000
ENOUGH FOR REPUBLICANS.

3625
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:56,000
KELLY WRIGHT LIVE AT THE WHITE
HOUSE.

3626
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:57,000
THEY'RE HARD TO COME BY, AREN'T

3627
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:58,000
THEY?

3628
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
IT'S KIND OF DRIPS AND DRABS.

3629
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
>> JUST DRIPS AND DRABS, BUT

3630
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
HOPEFULLY GETTING TO SOME

3631
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,000

3633
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000

THEY TALKED FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES

3640
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
IN THAT MEETING.

3641
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:20,000
MR. BAIN PUT THE REPUBLICAN DEAL

MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS A

3645
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:28,000
YEAR.
THAT'S A MAJOR CONCESSION FOR

3646
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:31,000
JOHN BOEHNER AND IN A

3647
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,000
COUNTEROFFER, THE PRESIDENT

3648
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:33,000

$400,000 A YEAR.

3652
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,000
HERE IS A ROUGH OUTLINE OF THE

3653
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:41,000
PROPOSED DEAL.

3654
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:42,000

$1 TRILLION IN CUTS.

3656
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:45,000
$1 TRILLION IN REVENUE.

3657
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
SOME OF THAT WILL REQUIRE AN

3658
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:48,000
IMMEDIATE DOWN PAYMENT AND THEN

3659
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:49,000
LEGISLATIVE PROCESSING IT

3660
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
THROUGH THE NEXT YEAR.

3661
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:52,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ALSO GIVING

3662
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:53,000
IN TO SOME OF THE GOP'S DEMANDS

3663
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:56,000
FOR SPENDING CUTS ON ENTITLEMENT

3664
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,000
PROGRAMS SUCH AS LOWERING THE

3665
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:00,000
COST OF LIVING INCREASES FOR

3666
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
PEOPLE ON SOCIAL SECURITY.
THE CONCESSIONS FROM BOTH SIDES,

3667
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,000
HOWEVER, SHOW THEY COULD BE

3668
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
CLOSE TO A DEAL AND IN A

3669
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000

A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

3672
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
ADDING, QUOTE, WE HOPE TO

3673
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,000
CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

3674
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,000
PRESIDENT SO WE CAN REACH AN

3675
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:15,000
AGREEMENT THAT IS TRULY BALANCED

3676
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:20,000
AND BEGINS TO SOLVE OUR SPENDING

3677
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:23,000
PROBLEM.
>> A COMPROMISE THAT IS -- MEETS

3678
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:27,000
THE PRESIDENT'S PRINCIPLES AND

3679
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
OBJECTIVES OF DEFICIT REDUCTION

3680

THE MIDDLE CLASS AND SENIORS AND

3682
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:37,000
ASKS THE WEALTHIEST TO PAY MORE

3683
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
WILL REQUIRE TOUGH CHOICES BY

3684
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:40,000
ALL SIDES.

3685
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
>> TOUGH CHOICES ON BOTH SIDES

3686
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:43,000
AND WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY

3687
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
JAY CARNEY WENT ON TO SAY THE

3688
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:46,000
DEAL, WHEN IT'S FINALLY MADE,

3689
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
APPARENTLY BOTH SIDES WILL NOT

3690
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
BE HAPPY WITH IT OR PLEASED WITH

3691
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,000
IT BECAUSE THERE WILL BE SOME

3692
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:52,000
GIVING AND TAKING ON BOTH SIDES

3693
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:53,000
OF THE AISLE.

3694
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
CONGRESS, BY THE WAY, JUST HAS

3695
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,000
TWO WEEKS TO HAMMER OUT A DEAL.

3696
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
TWO WEEKS NOW FROM THOSE

3697
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:59,000
AUTOMATIC SPENDING CUTS GOING

3699
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
THEY'VE GOT TO GET SOMETHING

3700
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:04,000
DONE.
BACK TO YOU.

3701
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:05,000
>> Steve: KELLY, THANK YOU VERY

3702
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:06,000
MUCH.
YEAH.

3703
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
HE'S RIGHT.
BOTH SIDES GIVE SOMETHING, BUT

3704
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
IT SEEMS LIKE A WASHOUT FOR THE

3705
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:11,000
REPUBLICANS.
I DON'T KNOW WHY BOEHNER WOULD

3706
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:12,000
GO ALONG WITH IT AT THIS POINT.

3707
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:15,000
>> Brian: ONE THING HE WOULD GET

3708
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,000
IS THE BAUSCH TAX CUTS

3709
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:19,000
PERMANENT.

3710
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:22,000
THE THING IS THE DIVIDENDS,

3711
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
INVESTMENT TAX GOING UP WILL BE

3712
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
DEVASTATE TO GO WALL VOTE.

3713
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,000
>> Steve: ESPECIALLY THOSE ON

3714
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000

EXTREME WEATHER LEADS TO A

02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,000
TERRIFYING NIGHT FOR TWO PARENTS

3737
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
IN WASHINGTON WHEN STRONG WINDS

3738
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
SENT A HUGE TREE CRASHING

3739
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:07,000
THROUGH THEIR HOUSE, LANDING

3740
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:11,000
INCHES FROM THEIR SLEEPING BABY.

3741

IT'S THE BABY'S ROOM.

3745
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:19,000
>> THERE WAS A COUPLE BROKEN

3746
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
TRUSSES, SHEETING HANGING DOWN.

3747
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
SO YEAH, IT COULD HAVE BEEN --

3748
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:24,000
I'M SURE IT WAS SCARY FOR THE

3749
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:25,000
PARENTS WHEN THEY WENT IN THE

3750
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:26,000
ROOM.

3751
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
>> Steve: EASILY.
THE TREE LANDED A COUPLE OF FEET

3752
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:29,000
AWAY FROM THE BABY'S CRIB.

3753
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:33,000
LUCKILY HE DID NOT HAVE A

3754

3790
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:38,000
AND REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER MITT

3791
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:39,000
ROMNEY.

3792
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:40,000
UNFORTUNATELY, THE LIST CLOSES

3793
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
OUT WITH A MOMENT NO ONE IS

3794
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
GOING TO FORGET.

3795
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,000
HEARTBREAK IN NEWTOWN,

3796
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
CONNECTICUT AS POLICE LEAD A

3797
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
LINE OF CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR

3798
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
SCHOOL AFTER, OF COURSE, THE

3799
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:52,000
SHOOTER OPENED FIRE.

3800
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
THAT IMAGE FROM THE NEWTOWN BEE.

3801
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:55,000
>> Gretchen: IN THE WAKE OF THAT

3802
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
TRAGIC SHOOTING, SOME ARE

3803
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
TURNING TO THEIR FAITH IN ORDER

3804
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:00,000
TO TRY AND COPE.

3805
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
OUR NEXT GUEST SAYS IT'S RIGHT

3806
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
TO HOLD OUT HOPE BECAUSE HEAVEN

3807
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:05,000
IS REAL.

3808
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
HOW DOES HE KNOW?

3809
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:08,000
HE'S BEEN THERE.

3810
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:11,000
HE IS A NOTED NEURAL SURGEON AND

3811
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:14,000
THE AUTHOR OF "PROOF OF HEAVEN,"

3812
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:15,000
BEST SELLER.

3813
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
HE'S BEEN ON THE SHOW SEVERAL

3814
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
TIMES.
PEOPLE KEEP WANTING TO YOU COME

3815
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:20,000
BACK BECAUSE ESPECIALLY NOW IN

3816
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:23,000
THE WAKE OF THIS TRAGEDY, YOU

3817
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
OFFER HOPE BECAUSE YOU'VE SEEN

3818
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
THE LIGHT, RIGHT?

3819
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:30,000
>> THAT'S VERY MUCH THE CASE.

3820
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:33,000
MY HEARTFELT LOVE AND PRAYERS GO

3821
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:36,000
OUT TO THOSE AFFECTED BY THIS

3822
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:37,000
TRAGEDY.
>> Steve: SURE, I UNDERSTAND

3823
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:40,000
THAT YOU FEEL THAT WHEN TRAGEDY

3824
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:41,000
HITS A TOWN AND A FAMILY LIKE

3825
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,000
THIS ONE DOES, GOD FINDS A WAY

3826
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
TO HELP THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES.

3827
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:49,000
EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN.

3828
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:54,000
>> VERY MUCH IT HAS TO DO WITH

3829
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
THE BELIEF AND KNOWING THAT THAT

3830
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,000
IS POSSIBLE.

3831
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:00,000
FOR ME IT'S BECOME VERY, VERY

3832
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:01,000
CLEAR THAT THAT ENTIRE REALM AND

3833
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:04,000
THE ETERNITY OF OUR SOULS IS

3834
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
VERY MUCH A PART OF ALL REALITY.

3835
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:09,000
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I

3836
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
WANT TO OFFER TO THEM IS JUST

3837
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:15,000
KNOWING THAT THAT BELIEF CAN

3838
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
OFFER COMFORT AND THAT THEY CAN

3839
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:20,000
KNOW THAT THOSE PRECIOUS SOULS

3840
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:23,000
ARE CHERISHED AND CARED FOR

3841
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
RIGHT NOW.

3842
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:28,000
AND THAT IS -- IT CAN BE A VERY

3843
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
COMFORTING MESSAGE.

3844
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
I'M NOT TAKING AWAY FROM THE
FACT THIS THIS IS A HORRIBLE

3845
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:33,000
TRAGEDY, VERY PAINFUL.

3846
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:36,000
AND I THINK IT'S A WAKE-UP CALL

3847
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:41,000
TO ALL OF US TO GET BACK TO OUR

3848
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
SPIRITUAL CORE AND TO REALLY

3849
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:46,000
SUPPORT EACH OTHER AND REALLY

3850
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
BRING MUCH MORE LOVE AND

3851
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
COMPASSION INTO THIS WORLD.

3852
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:51,000
>> Brian: THOSE CHILDREN WHO

3853
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:54,000
DIED IN SO MUCH HORROR AND

3854
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
RAPIDLY, WITHIN THREE MINUTES,

3855
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
ALL THE DAMAGE DONE, DO YOU LET

3856
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,000
EVERYONE KNOW WHAT YOU

3857
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:00,000
EXPERIENCED AND WHAT YOU THINK

3858
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:04,000
THEY'RE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW.

3859
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
>> IT'S VERY MUCH ONE OF BEING

3860
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:10,000
WELCOMED INTO COMFORT AND LOVE

3861
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
BEYOND OUR HUMAN UNDERSTANDING.

3862
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:13,000
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MANY

3863
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
PEOPLE, MILLIONS WHO HAVE HAD

3864
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES BRING

3865
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:22,000
BACK IS THAT COMFORT IS SO

3866
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
BEAUTIFUL AND ABSOLUTELY

3867
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:25,000
CHERISHED.

3868
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:28,000
WE GO BACK TO OUR HOME, TO OUR

3869
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:29,000
MAKER.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THOSE

3870
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:32,000
BELOVED SOULS ARE RIGHT NOW.

3871
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,000
>> Gretchen: DOCTOR, IF PEOPLE

3872
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:36,000
DON'T KNOW YOUR STORY, YOU WERE

3873
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:37,000
ILL.
YOU WERE IN A COMA.

3874
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
YOU LEFT THIS EARTH FOR A WEEK.

3875
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
YOU WERE IN HEAVEN AND THEN YOU

3876
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
WROTE ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES

3877
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
THERE AND YOU WERE TOLD THAT YOU

3878
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
WERE SUPPOSED TO COME BACK TO

3879
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:48,000
THE EARTH.

3880
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:51,000
AS PEOPLE ARE GRAPPLING WITH THE

3881
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:55,000
HORRIBLE NATURE OF THIS TRAGEDY,

3882
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:58,000
WILL THESE CHILDREN FORGET WHEN

3883
02:40:58,000 --> 02:40:59,000
THEY'RE IN HEAVEN WHAT HAPPENED

3884
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:03,000
TO THEM?

3885
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:04,000
>> THEY WILL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,

3886
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:05,000
BUT THEY WILL NOT FEEL THE PAIN.

3887
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:09,000
THEY WILL FEEL THE LOVE AND

3888
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
CHERISHING OF THEIR BEING BACK

3889
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,000
THERE.
AND THEY WILL KNOW THAT THEY

3890
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:15,000
HAVE CHANGED THIS WORLD BECAUSE

3891
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:20,000
IT IS ABOUT CHANGING DOWN HERE,

3892
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:21,000
CHANGING THIS WORLD THAT WE LIVE

3893
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:24,000
IN BY GROWING OUR SPIRITUAL

3894
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:25,000
FAITH, BY KNOWING THAT LOVE,

3895
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:28,000
KNOWING THE ETERNITY OF OUR

3896
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:29,000
SOULS, AND KNOWING THAT THIS IS

3897
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:32,000
ALL ABOUT COMPASSION AND

3898
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:35,000
FORGIVENESS AND LOVING EACH

3899
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:39,000
OTHER WITHOUT ANY BOUNDARYIES.

3900
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
>> Brian: YOUR BOOK AND YOU'RE A

3901
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
NEUROSURGEON, YOU NEVER BELIEVED
IN THIS UNTIL IT HAPPENED TO YOU

3902
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
AND YOU WERE BRAIN DEAD FOR A

3903
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:46,000
WEEK AND YOUR FRIENDS WHO WORK

3904
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:47,000
IN YOUR BUSINESS SAY THERE IS NO

3905
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
WAY YOU COULD HAVE POSSIBLY COME

3906
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
BACK.
THERE WAS NO ACTIVITY THERE.

3907
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:56,000
WHERE IS THE SHOOTER?

3908
02:41:56,000 --> 02:42:01,000
>> THE SHOOTER IS IN A PLACE OF

3909
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:06,000
REVIEWING HIS OWN LIFE --

3910
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:07,000
>> Steve: PURGATORY?

3911
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S WHAT'S

3912
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
CALLED A LIFE REVIEW IN THE

3913
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
WHOLE NEAR DEATH LITERATURE.

3914
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:16,000
IT'S A VERY REAL PHENOMENON OF

3915
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
RELIVING ALL THE EVENTS OF ONE'S

3916
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
LIFE AND RELIVING THE PAIN AND

3917
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:21,000
SUFFERING THAT WE'VE HANDED OUT

3918
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:22,000
TO OTHERS.

3919
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
BUT FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW,

3920
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:27,000
AND IN THAT REALM, THAT PAIN IS

3921
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
STILL MUCH MORE INTENSE -- FELT

3922
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:30,000
MORE INTENSELY BY THE

3923
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:31,000
PERPETRATOR THAN EVER FELT BY

3924
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
THE VICTIMS HERE ON EARTH.

3925
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
I THINK IT'S ALSO A CALL,

3926
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:38,000
THOUGH, ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS AND

3927
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:41,000
OUR SOCIETY NEEDS TO HELP THOSE

3928
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL.

3929
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD

3930
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
HAVE HELPED IN THIS KIND OF

3931
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
SITUATION, TO TRY AND HAVE A

3932
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:50,000
MUCH BETTER SAFETY NET TO HELP

3933
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
THOSE PEOPLE AND SHOW THEM LOVE

3934
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:53,000
AND COMPASSION.

3935
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:54,000
