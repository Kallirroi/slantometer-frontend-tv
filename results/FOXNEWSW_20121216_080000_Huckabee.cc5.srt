00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
>> Judge Jeanine: TONIGHT WE
ARE COMING TO YOU LIVE FROM

2
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT WHICH

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
JUST YESTERDAY WAS THE SCENE

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
OF UNIMAGINABLE HORROR AND

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
GRIEF.

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
TODAY A COMMUNITY AND A NATION

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
STRUGGLE TO MAKE SENSE OF THE

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
INCOMPREHENSIBLE.
THE SENSELESS KILLING OF

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
INNOCENCE, CHILDREN AND THEIR

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
TEACHERS.
WE NOW KNOW THE NAMES OF ALL

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
20 CHILDREN AGES 6 AND 7 WHO

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
WERE MURDERED IN THEIR OWN

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
CLASSROOM.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
THAT PLACE WHICH SHOULD BE A

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
HAVEN OF SAFETY IN A HEARTLESS

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
WORLD.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
THEIR NAMES SO MUCH LIKE THE

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
NAMES OF CHILDREN WE ALL KNOW,

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
12 GIRLS AND 8 BOYS.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
CHARLOTTE AND DILLON, JESSE

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
AND EMILY TO NAME JUST A FEW.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
AND JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO,

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
WE HEARD FROM ROBBY PARKER THE

KILLED YESTERDAY ALONG WITH 19

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
OF HER LITTLE CLASSMATES.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
REALLY LIKE TO OFFER OUR

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO ALL THE

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
FAMILIES WHO WERE DIRECTLY

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
AFFECTED BY THIS SHOOTING.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
IT'S A HORRIFIC TRAGEDY AND WE

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
OUR HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
OUT TO THEM.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
>> Judge Jeanine: WE'RE ALSO

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
WHO HELPED THEIR CLASSMATES

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
ESCAPE.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
OF THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL WHO

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
RUSHED THE GUNMAN IN AN EFFORT

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
TO PROTECT HER SCHOOL.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
OF A TEACHER WHO PUT HERSELF

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
IN BETWEEN HER STUDENTS AND

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
THE GUNMAN TO PROTECT HER

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
STUDENTS.
BOTH LOSING THEIR LIVES.

CONNECTICUT AND I'M JUDGE

JEANINE PIRRO.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
THE POLICE DISPATCH AUDIO

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
TELLS THE CHILLING STORY AS

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000

>> Judge Jeanine: THE MEDICAL

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
EXAMINER DR. WAYNE CARVER HELD

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
A PRESS CONFERENCE A SHORT

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
TIME AGO GIVING US HORRIFYING

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
INSIGHT INTO WHAT HAPPENED AT

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
THAT SCHOOL IN THOSE LAST

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
MOMENTS.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
OUR OWN MOLLY LINE WAS AT THAT

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
PRESS CONFERENCE.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
MOLLY, TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
>> THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
RELEASED A LOT OF DETAILS

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
TODAY AND THEY REALLY SPEAK OF

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
CLARITY WITH JUST HOW HORRIBLE

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
THIS SITUATION WAS.

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
HE ESSENTIALLY MADE VERY CLEAR

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THAT THE VICTIM SUFFERED

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
MULTIPLE GUNSHOT WOUNDS AT THE

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
HANDS OF A LONG GUN, A RIFLE

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
HE CLARIFIED WHEN HE WAS ASKED

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
TO CLARIFY.
WE KNOW THAT HE PARTICIPATED

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
IN A NUMBER OF THOSE EXAMS

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
HIMSELF OF THE VICTIMS, OF

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
THESE LOVED ONES, AND THAT OF

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THOSE HE EXAMINED THEY

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
SUFFERED 3 TO 11 GUNSHOT

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
WOUNDS.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUCH
LITTLE CHILDREN, THE YOUNGEST

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
VICTIMS 6 YEARS OLD, A BOY

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000

THAT WERE DESPERATELY TRYING

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
TO SAVE THEIR OWN LIVES AND

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
THESE WOMEN, SIX WOMEN GUNNED

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
DOWN THAT WERE TRYING TO SAVE

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
THE CHILDREN.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
>> Judge Jeanine: YOU KNOW,

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
WHAT WAS INTERESTING IN THAT

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
PRESS CONFERENCE IS ALSO THE
FACT THAT HE SAID ALTHOUGH HE

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
IS A CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER,

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
THIS IS THE WORST THAT HE HAS

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
EVER SEEN.

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
>> HE SAYS HE HAS WORKED ABOUT

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
A THIRD OF A CENTURY IN HIS

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
LIFE DOING MEDICAL EXAMS.

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
THIS IS THE WORST HE HAS SEEN

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
AND THE WORST THAT ALL HIS

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
COLLEAGUES HAVE SEEN.

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE NATURE

115
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
OF THIS.
JUST HEARING ABOUT IT, WHAT WE

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
HAVE SEEN HERE ON THE SCENE,

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
THE EMOTION OF THE COMMUNITY,

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
BUT HE HAS PHYSICALLY SEEN IT

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
HIMSELF.

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
THEY ASKED IF HE HAD BROKEN

121
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
DOWN YET IF HE HAD CRIED

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
ABOUT.
THIS HE SAID SO FAR HE HASN'T.

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
HE SAID SO FAR HE HASN'T.

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
>> Judge Jeanine: CLEARLY A

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
BIG ISSUE WILL BE, YOU KNOW,

126
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE BY ALL

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
THESE FIRST RESPONDERS, POLICE

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
AND EVERYONE ELSE.

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
MOLLY, WE HEAR THAT THE

130
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
PRESIDENT IS COMING INTO TOWN

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
TOMORROW.

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT
THAT?

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
>> THE DETAILS HAVEN'T BEEN

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
NAILED DOWN EXACTLY BUT

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS EXPECTED TO

136
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
MAKE A VISIT TO THE TOWN TO

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
PARTICIPATE IN AN INTERFAITH

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
VIGIL ESSENTIALLY PULL TOYING

139

THIS COMMUNITY.

140
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
SOME VIGILS HELD AGAINST THIS

141
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
COMMUNITY SINCE THE MASSACRE

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
HAS OCCURRED.

143
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
EVERYONE PULLING TOGETHER.

144
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
THE NEWTOWN HAS PULLED

145
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
TOGETHER.

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY HAS

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
PULLED TOGETHER.
THIS JUST SHOWS THAT THE

148
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
ENTIRE COUNTRY IS INVOLVED IN

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE.

150
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER TRAGEDY.

151
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
NOT JUST NEWTOWN AND NOT JUST

152
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
CONNECTICUT.
>> Judge Jeanine: ALL RIGHT,

153
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
MOLLY, THANKS SO MUCH.

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
MOLLY WILL BE ON THE SCENE

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
HERE TOMORROW CONTINUING WITH

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
HER COVERAGE.

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
AND NOW TO MIKE TOBIN WITH

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
REACTION FROM THE PEOPLE OF

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
THIS SMALL TOWN IN

160
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
CONNECTICUT.

161
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
MIKE?
>> AND, JUDGE, THIS IS A NIGHT

162
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
WHEN THE PAIN OF THIS TRAGEDY

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
IS REFRESHED.

164
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE'RE

165
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
LEARNING NOW THE NAMES AND THE

166
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
FACES OF THE SMALLEST VICTIMS

167
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
OF THIS UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY.

168
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
NAMES LIKE 7-YEAR-OLD GRACE

169
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
MCDONALD WHOSE FAMILY SAID SHE

170
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
WAS THE LOVE AND LIFE OF THAT

171
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
FAMILY.

172
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
6-YEAR-OLD EMILY PARKER, WHO

173
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
SAID GOOD BY TO HER FATHER

174
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
BEFORE HE WENT OFF TO WORK.

175
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
>> SHE WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT

176
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
AND I HAD ACTUALLY BEEN

177
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
TEACHING HER PORTUGUESE.

178
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
OUR LAST CONVERSATION WAS IN

179
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
PORTUGUESE.

180
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
AND SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING.

181
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
AND ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

182
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I SAID I WAS DOING WELL.

183
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME,

184
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
AND I GAVE HER A KISS AND I

185
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
WAS OUT THE DOOR.

186
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
>> SADLY FAMILIAR, THE

187
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
MAKESHIFT MEMORIALS ARE

188
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000

MAKE SURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN

242
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
A RELATIVELY SAFE AREA OF THE

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
ROOM AWAY FROM THE ENTRANCE OF

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
THE CLASSROOM THEY WERE

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO COME.

246
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000

251
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
ACTUALLY SHOT IN FRONT OF YOUR

252
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
6-YEAR-OLD SON?

253
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000

260
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
NORMAL ROUTINE.

261
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
WE'RE TRYING TO GET IN YOU

262
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
KNOW, BRUSH HIS TEETH AND GO

263
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
TO BED AT A REASONABLE TIME.

264
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
WE DO ASK HIM AND HE DOES ASK

265
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BAD

266
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
PERSON.
AND YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY WAS

267
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT.

268
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
HE WAS FEARFUL OF EVEN GOING

269
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
HOME AFTER WE LEFT THE

270
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
POLITICIAN.
YOU KNOW, HE -- LEFT THE

POLICE STATION.

272
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
HE IS GETTING BETTER BUT HE IS

273
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
STILL AFRAID OF BAD PEOPLE.

274
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
>> Judge Jeanine: ROBERT, I

275
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE

276
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
A 7-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WHO WAS

277
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
IN THE CAFETERIA ACTUALLY IN

278
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
LEAVING THE SCHOOL SAW THE

279
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
BODIES OF THESE CHILDREN?

280
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
>> WELL, IT'S HER CLASSROOM

281
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
WAS NEAR THE CAFETERIA.

282
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
SHE WAS IN HER ROOM WITH HER

283
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
TEACHER AND FELLOW STUDENTS IN

284
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
A DIFFERENT SECTION OF THE

285
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
BUILDING ON -- YEAH.

286
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
BUT SHE DID AS I'M SURE MANY

287
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
OF THE CHILDREN DID BEAR

288
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
WITNESS TO VERY HORRIFIC

289
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
THINGS.
BUT, YEAH, SHE DID SEE SOME

290
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
BODIES THERE, YEAH.

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
>> Judge Jeanine: FINALLY, I

292
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR SON

293
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
UNDERSTANDABLY, ADEN, WHO SAW

294
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
HIS TEACHER BEING SHOT, IS

295
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
RELUCTANT TO BE SEPARATED FROM

296
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
THE FAMILY OR FROM YOU.

297
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I IMAGINE THAT THAT'S NOT

298
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
SURPRISING?

299
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
>> YEAH.

300
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
SO WE'RE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE

301
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
GOING -- WE'RE GETTING THROUGH

302
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
THIS WITH THE LOVE AND SUPPORT

303
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
OF OUR FAMILY AND OUR

304
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
NEIGHBORS.

305
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
WE'RE STAYING CLOSE.

306
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT TODAY

307
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
WE DID -- HE DID HAVE A PLAY

308
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
DATE WITH A GOOD FRIEND OF

309
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
HIS.

310
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
AT HIS FRIEND'S HOUSE.

311
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
SO AS LONG AS HE IS SOMEWHERE

312
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
WHERE HE FEELS SAFE, IT'S A

313
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
GOOD THING.

314
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT HE

315
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
WANTS TO KNOW WE'RE CLOSE BY

316
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
AND WANTS TO STAY IN FAMILIAR

317
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
PLACES BUT, YEAH.

318
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
>> Judge Jeanine: CERTAINLY,

319
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDABLE.

MRS. MARTIN'S CLASS AND THEY,

CABINETS OR ANYTHING.

362
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
SOMEONE UNFORTUNATELY DID TRIP

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
THE LOUD SPEAKER SYSTEM AND

364
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
SHE HEARD CURSING COMING FROM

365
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
THE LOUD SPEAKER.

366
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
NOT CURSED KIDS KIND OF LOOKED

367
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
AROUND AND THEN THEY HEARD

372
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
SHE BASICALLY GOT THE KID IN

373
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
THE CORNER AND MADE THEM

374
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
REMAIN THERE QUIETLY AND THEY

375
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
JUST WAITED IT OUT UNTIL THE

376
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
POLICE CAME.

377
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
>> STEPHAN, THIS WHOLE SIR

378
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
COUPLE STANCE, I MEAN, THIS

379
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
WHOLE SITUATION, WHEN DID YOU

380
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
HEAR ABOUT IT?

381
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING YOU

382
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
HEARD AND WHAT WERE THE FIRST

383
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
THOUGHTS?
>> THE TOWN IS, AS EVERYBODY

384
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
HAS HEARD ACROSS THE COUNTRY

385
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
AND THE WORLD, THE TOWN IS

386
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
JUST A GREAT GREAT TOWN AND

387
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
WHAT MOST AMERICANS

388
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING LIKE THIS

389
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
NEVER HAPPENS, ESPECIALLY IN

390
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
OUR TOWN.

391
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
THEY NEED TO BE AWARE BUT

392
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
BASICALLY WE HAVE A REVERSED

393
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
911 SYSTEM RECALL ANY EVENTS

394
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
THAT HAPPENED.

395
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
AND IF YOU SEE THAT AND I

396
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
FIRST HEARD THAT THERE WAS A

397
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
POSSIBLE SHOOTING.

398
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000

399
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
THROUGH YOUR MIND OBVIOUSLY

ADRENALINE GOES RIGHT TO YOUR

402
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
HEAD.

403
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
SO BASICALLY I WAS AT MY

405
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000

ACTUALLY WAS LOCATING OUR

409
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
CHILDREN FOR US.

410
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I HAD A SENSE OF RELIEF BEFORE

411
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I ACTUALLY GOT THERE UNTIL I

412
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
ACTUALLY SAW HER I WASN'T

413
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
SATISFIED.

418
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
AMAZING STORIES FROM INSIDE

419
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
THE SCHOOL.

420
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
A TEACHER TELLS US ABOUT THE

421
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
STUDENTS THAT HE LOST.

422
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
>> EVIL VISITED THIS COMMUNITY

423
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
TODAY.

424
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
>> A CALL CAME INTO DISPATCH,

TO THAT AREA AS THEY CONVERGED

428
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
ON THE SCHOOL.

429
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
>> THE CHILDREN OBVIOUSLY WERE

430
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
VERY SHAKEN.

431
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
THEY WERE CRYING IN THE

432
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
CLOSET.

433
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
WHEN THEY WERE LEAVING, THE

434
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
POLICE MADE THEM HOLD HANDS

435
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
AND TOLD THEM TO CLOSE THEIR

436
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
EYES.

437
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
>> THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

438
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

439
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS.

440
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

441
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
>> MY GYM TEACHER DIRECTED US

442
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
TO STAY AGAINST THE WALL.

443
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
EVERYBODY STARTED KIND OF

444
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
PANICKING.

445
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
>> THERE IS NO WORDS.

446
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
IT'S SHEAR TERROR.

447
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
>> DOESN'T EVEN SEEM REAL.

448
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
IT JUST DOES NOT SEEM LIKE

449
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE.

450
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
>> WE ALL HUDDLED AND I KEPT

451
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
HEARING THESE BOOMING NOISES.

OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

456
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
>> KIDS WERE TERRIFIED.

457
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
THEY WERE TERRIFIED.

458
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
THEY HAD JUST WITNESSED

459
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
SOMETHING AND THEY WERE

460
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
TERRIFIED.

461
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
>> MOST TRAUMATIZING THING I

462
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
HAVE EVER BEEN THROUGH.

463
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
>> MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF

464
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
WOUNDS.

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
THE PARENTS.

PARENTS WHO HAVE TO DROP KIDS

488
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
OFF EARLY.

489
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T HAVE

490
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
BABYSITTERS AT 7:00 IN THE

491
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000

PARENTS WHO COME HOME LATE AT

NIGHT NEED TO PARK THEIR KIDS

493
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
EVEN HEARD HIS NAME BEFORE?

511
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
>> I'M SORRY, I JUST.

512
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
>> Judge Jeanine: YOU NEVER

513
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
HEARD OF HIM.
>> I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN

514
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000

A LOT OF FUN.
I LOVE KIDS.

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
WE HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH

526
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000

PRETTY FRESH.
SO I GET A LITTLE CHOKED UP.

531

537
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
SENT THEM OFF.

538
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000

>> WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE

554
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
POINT OF ENTRY.

555
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I CAN TELL YOU IT HE WAS NOT

556
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
VOLUNTARILY LET INTO THE

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
SCHOOL AT ALL.

558
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
THAT HE FORCED HIS WAY INTO

559
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
THE SCHOOL.
THAT'S AS FAR AS WE CAN GO ON

560
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
THAT.

561
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
>> Judge Jeanine: YESTERDAY'S
MASSACRE WAS JUST THE LATEST

562
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
INCIDENT OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE

563
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS

564
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
COUNTRY.

565
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

566
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
HAD SAFETY MEASURES IN PLACE,

567
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
BUT THE SHOOTER WAS STILL ABLE

568
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
TO GAIN ENTRY WHICH RAISES THE

569
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
QUESTION HOW SAFE ARE OUR

570
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
SCHOOLS AND HOW SAFE ARE OUR

571
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
CHILDREN?

572
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
WITH ME IS FAIRFIELD COUNTY

573
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
POLICE CHIEF GARY MCNAMARA.

574
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

575
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

576
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
>> YOU ARE A POLICE CHIEF JUST

577
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
30 MILES FROM HERE.

578
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
>> JUST A LITTLE SOUTH OF

579
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
NEWTOWN, YEAH.

580
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
>>
>> Judge Jeanine: YOU ARE

581
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
FAMILIAR WITH THE ISSUE OF

582
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
SCHOOL VIOLENCE AND SCHOOL
SAFETY IN CONNECTICUT.

583
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
>> I AM.

584
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
>> CONNECTICUT IS A SMALL

585
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
STATE.
SO YOU KNOW THE CHIEFS OF

586
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
POLICE IN THE AREA REALLY GET

587
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
TOGETHER.
SO ANY TIME ANYTHING HAPPENS

588
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
WE REALLY DO COME TOGETHER AND

589
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
DISSECT IT TOGETHER.

590
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
>> Judge Jeanine: CHIEF, WHAT
IS MANDATED.

591
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
IS CONNECTICUT, IS THERE

592
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
ANYTHING THAT'S REQUIRED OF

593
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
THIS STATE?

594
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
>> THERE IS, ALL SCHOOLS HAVE

595
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
TO HAVE A CRISIS PLAN IN

596
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
PLACE.

597
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
AND THEN EVERY THREE MONTHS

598
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
AFTER COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL IN

599
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
2000, THEY HAVE TO -- EVERY

600
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
THREE MONTHS PUT THAT PLAN

601
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
INTO PLACE.

602
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT, THE

603
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS HAVE TO

604
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
WORK WITH LOCAL LAW

605
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
ENFORCEMENT EVERY THREE

606
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
MONTHS.
SORT OF LIKE A FIRE DRILL TO

607
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN TO ENSURE

608
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
--
>> -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THESE

609
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
CHILDREN ACTUALLY HAD GONE

610
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
THROUGH SOME OF THE FIRE
DRILLS AND THEY HAD DONE THAT.

611
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
BUT THE ISSUE OF SAFETY AND

612
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
THE THREAT ASSESSMENT, I MEAN,

613
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

614
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
MANDATE THAT EVERY SCHOOL HAVE

615
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
A THREAT ASSESSMENT DONE

616
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
REGARDING SAFETY?

617
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
>> WELL, I THINK THERE IS SOME

618
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
SORT OF A MANDATE.

619
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
AND I'M NOT REALLY FAMILIAR

620
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
WITH HOW HEAVY THAT MANDATE

621
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
IS.
BUT I THINK GIVEN THE

622
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
ATMOSPHERE.
IT'S A PUBLIC MANDATE.

623
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A THREAT

624
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
ASSESSMENT IN EACH SCHOOL.

625
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
>> Judge Jeanine: WHO DECIDES,
CHIEF, HOW MUCH SAFETY IS

626
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
IMPLEMENTED AT A PARTICULAR

627
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
SCHOOL.
>> I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE

628
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

629
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
IT DEPENDS ON THE LAW

630
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
ENFORCEMENT AND THE DESIGN OF

631
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
THE SCHOOL.

632
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
HOW OLD THE SCHOOLS ARE.

633
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
>> Judge Jeanine: IT'S REALLY

634
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
THE LOCALS WHO DECIDE THIS?

635
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
>> IT COMES DOWN FROM THE

636
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
STATE.
SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN GO TO THE

637
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
STATE POLICE AND GO TO THE

638
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
STATE FOR THREAT ASSESSMENT.

639
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
>> Judge Jeanine: ALL RIGHT.
AND FINALLY THIS IS NOT THE

640
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
FIRST TIME THAT THIS STATE HAS

641
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
DEALT WITH THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL

642
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
VIOLENCE.

643
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
>> IT HAS NOT.
WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SOMETHING

644
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
IN FAIRFIELD BACK IN 2002, A

645
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
CLASSROOM FULL OF STUDENTS

646
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
HELD HOSTAGE FOR A PERIOD OF 8

647
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
HOURS.
THANKFULLY NOBODY WAS INJURED

648
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
AS THE CASE HERE.

649
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
IT TOUCHES ALL OF US.

650
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
CONNECTICUT IS A SMALL STATE.

651
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
WE ARE ALL HERE HELPING

652
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
TOGETHER.

653
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
>> Judge Jeanine: UNFORTUNATELY

654
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
WE HAD MANY DIE IN JUST OVER
THE WOODS BEHIND ME RIGHT NOW.

655
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
CHIEF, FINALLY, VERY QUICKLY,

656
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS COULD
HAVE BEEN PREVENTED?

657
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
>> YOU KNOW, GIVEN THE MINIMUM

658
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
FACTS I HAVE, I DON'T THINK IT

659
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED.

660
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> I THINK WE HAVE SAVED A LOT

661
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
MORE KIDS THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN

662
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
DONE IF THERE WERE NO PLANS IN

663
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
PLACE.
>> I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO WORK

664
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
A LITTLE HARDER THOUGH.

665
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
CHIEF MCNAMARA THANK YOU FOR

666
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
BEING WITH US THIS EVENING.

667
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> COMING UP:  WHO WAS THIS

668
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
SHOOTER WHO LITERALLY

669
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
UNLEASHED HELL AT AN

670
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

671
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
COMING UP INSIDE THE MIND OF A

672
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
KILLER.

673
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
>> HE WAS DIFFERENT, HE WAS

674
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
QUIET.
NICE KID.
GOOD KID.

675
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I MEAN, HE WAS DEFINITELY

676
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
CHALLENGE THE FAMILY IN THAT

677
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
HOUSE.

678
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
EVERY FAMILY HAS ONE.
I HAVE ONE.

679
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
THEY HAVE ONE.

680
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
BUT NEVER IN TROUBLE WITH THE

681
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
LAW.

682
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
NEVER IN TROUBLE WITH

683
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
ANYTHING.

684
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I KNOW SHE HAD ISSUES WITH

685
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
SCHOOL.
SHE EVENTUALLY WOUND UP HOME

686
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
SCHOOLING HIM.

687
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
SHE BATTLED WITH THE SCHOOL

688
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
DISTRICT.
IN WHAT CAPACITY I'M NOT 100%

689
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
CERTAIN IF IT WAS BEHAVIOR OR

690
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
LEARNING DISABILITIES, I

691
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
REALLY DON'T KNOW BUT IS HE A

692
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
VERY VERY BRIGHT BOY.

693
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
HE IS SMART.

694
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
>> Judge Jeanine: IT DOESN'T

695
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
MAKE SENSE.

696
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

697
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
SHOOTER.
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU MY

698
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
BACKGROUND, I'M REALLY NOT SO

699
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
INTERESTED IN THE MENTAL STATE

700
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
OF THE SHOOTER.
I'M INTERESTED IN THE VICTIM.

701
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'M INTERESTED IN THE PEOPLE

702
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
WHO NEVER CHOSE TO BE A VICTIM

703
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
IN THE FIRST PLACE AS OPPOSED

704
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
TO GUY WHO MAKES A A DECISION

705
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
TO DRESS UP IN BLACK GARB AND

706
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
A MILITARYAKE A

707
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
LONG GUN AND TWO

708
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
SEMIAUTOMATICS AND COME INTO

709
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
THE SCHOOL WHERE THE MOST

710
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
VULNERABLE VICTIMS IN OUR

711
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
SOCIETY ARE AND TAKE THEIR

712
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
LIVES.
TO ME, THE ISSUE OF THE STATE

713
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
OF MIND OF THE CRIMINAL IS NOT

714
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
SO MUCH ABOUT HIS STATE OF

715
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
MIND BUT ABOUT HIS CHOICE.

716
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
HE IS THE ONE WHO CHOSE TO

717
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
PICK UP A GUN.

718
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
HE IS THE ONE WHO CHOSE TO

719
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
MAKE A DECISION TO KILL.

720
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
BUT HAVING SAID THAT, MY

721
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
PROSECUTOR BACKGROUND I WILL

722
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
NOW PUT ON HOLD AND I WILL ASK

723
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
AND FIRST OF ALL INTRODUCE

724
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
DR. JOHN SHARP, WHO IS A

725
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
PSYCHIATRIST ON THE FACULTY OF

726
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
THE HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,

727
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
DR. SHARP, SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU

728
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
HERE.
YOU HEARD ME RAMP, I DON'T

729
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
MUCH CARE ABOUT THIS GUY'S

730
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
STATE OF MIND.

731
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I CARE ABOUT THE VICTIMS.

732
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THE VICTIM'S FAMILY THE RIPPLE

733
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
EFFECT.
THE FACT THAT THIS TOWN WILL

734
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
FOREVER BEAR THE INSIGNIFICANT

735
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
ANY I CAN'T INSIGNIA THAT

736
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
HAPPENS HERE.

737
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT GRIEVING

738
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
AND.

739
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
>> I'M A PARENT.

740
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I DROP THEM OFF AT THAT SCHOOL

741
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WOULD

742
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
LEARN TO BE SAFE.

743
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
WHAT AM I FEELING RIGHT NOW?

744
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
>> YOU ARE FEELING ANGRY.

745
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
YOU ARE FEELING SCARED.

746
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
YOU ARE FEELING SO MANY

747
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
DIFFERENT EMOTIONS IT'S HARD

748
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
TO KEEP THEM STRAIGHT.

749
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
EVERYONE WOKE UP TODAY TO THE

750
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
WORST NIGHTMARE TO EVEN

751
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
IMAGINE THAN WHEN THEY WENT TO

752
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
BED LAST NIGHT.

753
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
WHAT PARENTS HAVE TO DO IS

754
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
PROVIDE A SENSE OF SAFETY FOR

755
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
THEIR CHILDREN.

756
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
>> Judge Jeanine: BUT THEY

757
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
DIDN'T.
DO THEY LIVE WITH GUILT?

758
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
HOW DO THEY RESOLVE WHAT THEY

759
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
HAVE GONE THROUGH?

760
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
HOW DO THEY PROTECT THEIR OWN

761
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
CHILDREN.
>> WHAT WE KNOW TWO DIFFERENT

762
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
THINGS.

763
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
THAT DOESN'T MAKE US FEEL

764
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
BETTER OR SAFE WHEN WE

765
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
CONSIDER DROPPING OUR KID

766
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
SOMEWHERE OR GOING TO A MALL.

767
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WE

768
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
CAN SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER AND

769
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
RECREATE A SENSE OF SAFETY.

770
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
AND MAKE SURE THE KIDS FEEL

771
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THAT WAIT A MINUTE KIDS CAN BE

772
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
MORE RESILIENT THAN ADULTS

773
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
EVEN.

774
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
>> Judge Jeanine: I HE AGREE KIS

775
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
ARE MORE RESILIENT.

776
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
WE JUST SPOKE WITH A FATHER

777
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
WHOSE 6-YEAR-OLD IS AFRAID TO

778
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
HAVE HIM LEAVE HIM SIDE.

779
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
>> THAT'S A NORMAL RESPONSE.

780
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
RESPOND TO WHAT YOU ARE SEEING

781
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
IN YOUR CHILDREN.

782
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
IT'S DIFFERENT IF YOU ARE
TALKING TO A 6-YEAR-OLD OR A

783
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
PRETEEN OR TEEN.

784
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
6-YEAR-OLD IS VERY CONCRETE.

785
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
YOU WANT TO SEE THOUSAND THEY

786
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
ARE FEELING.
MAKE SURE THEY FEEL SAFE.

787
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
OBSERVE THEM AND COMFORT THEM.

788
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
PRETEENS GET CAUGHT UP IN

789
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
MORALITY.

790
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
VERY BLACK AND WHITE.
MAKE SURE THEY ARE THINKING

791
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
RIGHT.
>> Judge Jeanine: WHAT ABOUT

792
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
THE KIDS WHO ARE WATCHING

793
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
TELEVISION AND SHOULD PARENTS

794
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

795
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
SITUATION TO TALK TO THEIR

796
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
CHILDREN AND SAY THIS IS WHAT

797
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
YOU SHOULD DO OR THIS IS, YOU

798
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
KNOW, WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

799
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
WORLD?
>> ESPECIALLY THEY ARE TEENAGE

800
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
YEARS.
THE YOUNGER I THINK LESS

801
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
EXPOSURE THE BETTER.

802
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
ALL OF US CAN OVERDOSE ON

803
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
TELEVISION.

804
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
WE SHOULDN'T OVERDO IT IN ANY

805
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
WAY.
WE SHOULDN'T OVERDRINK OR

806
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
EXERCISE OR ISOLATE.

807
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
WE SHOULD TRY TO BE MOD

808
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
DEMOCRAT AND IN COMMUNICATION

809
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
WITH ONE ANOTHER AND OPEN TO

810
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
RECEIVE WHATEVER SUPPORT IS

811
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
GOING TO HELP US.

812
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
COUNSELORS, RELIGIOUS SUPPORT.

813
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
ONE ANOTHER.

814
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
>> WELL, OKAY.

815
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE

816
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
CHILDREN AND THE PARENTS WHO

817
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
CLEAR LIVE WILL GO INTO A

818
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
DEPRESSION?
>> WELL, THAT CAN BE TREATED.

819
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
SO I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

820
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
THINK THAT THAT'S A FAILURE.

821
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
WE DON'T THINK OF THAT OF ANY

822
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
KIND OF A SHORT OR MORAL

823
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
UPCOMING.

824
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
THAT'S VERY TREATABLE.

825
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE

826
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
SHOOTER HERE.

827
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
HE PLAY HAVE HAD A CONDITION

828
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
TOO.
ANYBODY SUFFERING NOW CAN BE

829
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
TREATED AND MOVE TOWARD

830
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
HEALING.
>> Judge Jeanine: FINAL

831
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
QUESTION BEFORE I GO TO

832
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
DR. BARBARA KERWIN A FORENSIC

833
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
PSYCHOLOGIST SITTING IN NEW
YORK CITY NOW.

834
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE SAY CAN THIS

835
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
KIND OF THING BE PREVENTED AND

836
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
YOU THINK THAT MAYBE IT CAN

837
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
BE, IF YOU KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT

838
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
THE INDIVIDUAL.

839
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
YOU KNOW, MY QUESTION REALLY

840
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
IS WHY IS THE WORLD SO

841
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
DIFFERENT TODAY?

842
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
WHY ARE PEOPLE DOING THIS?

843
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
WHY IS THIS BECOMING THE NORM?

844
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE THE

845
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
ONE ANSWER FOR THAT.

846
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
PEOPLE THINK THAT THERE IS A

847
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
TOO MUCH OF CULTURE OF

848
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
VIOLENCE.
PEOPLE ARE TOO ISOLATED IN

849
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
THEIR OWN MINDS.

850
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM ISN'T

851
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE.

852
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
LOVING EMBRACE THAT INSISTED

853
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
ON THERAPY OF A MEANINGFUL

854
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
SORT THAT HE COULD HAVE

855
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
ACCESSED AND AFFORD COULD HAVE

856
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
AVOIDED THIS.

857
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
>> DOCTOR, THANKS SO MUCH FOR

858
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
BEING WITH US THIS EVENING.

859
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
KNOW, DOCTOR, YOU RAN THE UNIT

860
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
FOR THE VIOLENT CRIMINALLY

861
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
INSANE AT CREED MORE.

862
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
SO YOU HAVE GOT A LOT OF

863
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
EXPERIENCE WITH THIS KIND OF

864
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
THING.
WERE THERE A TELL TALE SIGNS

865
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
OR ARE THERE PREDICTABLE

866
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
ISSUES OR FACTORS THAT WOULD

867
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
IDENTIFY THIS INDIVIDUAL AS A

868
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
DANGEROUS INDIVIDUAL.

869
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
>> WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH HIM

870
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
IS THE STORY THAT WE SEE AGAIN

871
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
AND AGAIN WITH THESE COINS OF

872
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
CREEPY PEOPLE THAT GO IN AND

873
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
UNLEASH THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE.

874
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
HE WAS THE LONER, HE DIDN'T

875
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
GET ALONG WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

876
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
HE HAD ISSUES IN SCHOOL.

877
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
HE WAS BRILL YENT.

878
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
BRIGHT AND SOMETHING WAS

879
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
DISTURBLILY WRONG AND NOBODY

880
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
SEEMED TO TAKE NOTICE OF IT

881
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
UNTIL WE HAVE THE UNTHINKABLE.

882
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
IT'S NOT SO UNTHINKABLE WHEN

883
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
WE HAVE A UNBALANCED PARANOID

884
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
ANGRY ISOLATED INDIVIDUAL.

885
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
IS HE REALLY FOLLOWING THE

886
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
PATTERN OF THAT PARANOID TYPE.

887
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
WE HAD JAMES HOLMES OUT IN

888
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
AURORA, COLORADO.
A SIMILAR KIND OF PERSONALITY.

889
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
AND MY ISSUE IS WHEN ARE WE

890
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
GOING TO BECOME AWARE OF THIS?

891
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO

892
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
INTERVENE?
>> Judge Jeanine: DOCTOR, IS

893
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
THERE ANY WAY FOR US AS A

894
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
SOCIETY TO SAY THIS GUY IS A

895
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
LONER, WE BETTER CHECK HIM

896
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
OUT?
LOOK, WHEN I WAS A JUDGE, THEY

897
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
BRING PEOPLE IN FLONT OF ME

898
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
AND SAY HE IS DANGER TO THE

899
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
COMMUNITY OR HIMSELF I DO A

900
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
PSYCHIATRIC ON HIM.

901
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
THIEVES ARE YOWNEL MALES IN

902
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
THEIR 20 WE ARE TALKING '.

903
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
AURORA, ALL OF THE OTHER

904
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
SHOOTINGS AND COLUMBINE AND

905
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
ALL OF THAT.

906
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
HOW DO WE CATCH THESE PEOPLE.

907
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
>> THEY ARE NOT ISOLATED

908
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
COMPLETELY A COMMUNITY OF ONE.

909
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
NOW THEY ARE KNOW OF PEOPLE

910
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
WHO KILLED THIS YOUNG MAN.

911
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
HE BASS POOR THE.

912
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I DIDN'T BEHAVE CORRECTLY.

913
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
THAT'S WHEN WE NEED TO NOTICE.

914
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
THAT'S WHEN WE NEED TO SAY HE

915
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED.

916
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
HE NEEDS HELP.

917
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
MORE STATES THAN NOT HAVE

918
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT

919
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
PROGRAMS.
WE CAN INSIST THAT PEOPLE WHO

920
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
SHOW WEIRDNESS, PROCLIVITIES

921
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
TRARDZ VIOLENCE, SOCIAL

922
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
ISOLATION, BIZARRE THINKING.

923
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
>> Judge Jeanine: YOU KNOW
WHAT, DOCTOR, WITH ALL DUE

924
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
RESPECT AND YOU ARE CERTAINLY

925
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
A WELL RESPECTED DOCTOR AS IS

926
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
DR. SHARP.
THIS KID WAS HOME COOD.

927
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
THERE HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING

928
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
BECAUSE HIS MOTHER WANTED TO

929
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
HOME SCHOOL HIM.

930
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000

SCHOOL HIM?

932
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
WHAT WAS GOING WRONG?

933
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
YOU DON'T PICK A KID OUT OF

934
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
SCHOOL AND HOME SCHOOL HIM IF

935
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000

936
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
SCHOOL UNLESS YOU HAVE A

937
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
RELIGIOUS PERSUASION.

938
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000

THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

945
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000

946
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
ARSENAL EVER WEAPONS.

947
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
WHERE DID HE GET THEM AND WHY

948
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
DID HE USE THEM?

949
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
STAY WITH US.

950
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
>> ALL THE WOUNDS THAT I KNOW

951
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
OF AT THIS POINT WERE CAUSED

952
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
BY THE LONG WEAPON.
THIS TYPE OF WEAPON IS NOT --

953
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
THE BULLETS ARE DESIGNED IN

954
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
SUCH A FASHION THAT THE

955
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
ENERGY, THIS IS VERY CLINICAL.

956
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I SHOULDN'T BE SAYING.

957
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
THIS THE ENERGY IS DEPOSITED

958
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
IN THE TISSUE SO THE BULLETS

959
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
[INAUDIBLE]

960
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
>> Judge Jeanine: JOINING ME

NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND SOMEONE

963
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
WHO LIKE ME, HAS BEEN AT MANY

964
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
CRIME SCENES INVOLVING YOUNG

965
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
CHILDREN.
MARK, ARE YOU THERE?

966
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000

YOU NOW.
ALL RIGHT, MARK, LOOK, THERE

969
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
IS NO QUESTION THAT THE DEVIL

970
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
HAD BEEN IN NEWTOWN

971
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
CONNECTICUT.

972
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
YOU AND I HAVE SEEN OUTCOME

973
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
CHILDREN IN HOMICIDE SCENES.

974
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
IT IS SOMETHING THAT NOTHING
CAN PREPARE YOU FOR.

975
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
BUT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN

976
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
THIS SITUATION.

977
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN DEAD

978
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
AND AS WE HEARD FROM THE

979
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER WITH MULTIPLE

980
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
WOUNDS HAS TO BE DIFFICULT FOR

981
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
THE MOST SEASONED HOMICIDE

982
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
DETECTIVE AND THE FIRST

983
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
RESPONDERS.

984
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT, MARC?

985
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
>> I SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

986
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
IT'S ONE THING THAT YOU DEAL

987
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
WITH, SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT

988
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
COMMIT THEIR LIFE TO CRIME.

989
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
GANG MEMBERS.

990
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
PEOPLE WHO COMMIT TO VIOLENCE.

991
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
THEY END UP GETTING SHOT OR

992
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
INJURED.

993
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
THAT'S ONE THING EVEN A

994
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
DOMESTIC SITUATION IS

995
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
DIFFERENT INNOCENT CHILDREN.

996
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
NOBODY PREPARED FOR.
THIS THE ONLY SCENES THAT I

997
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
REALLY REMEMBER THAT I CAN

998
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
NEVER ERASE, ONE IS A

999
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
4-YEAR-OLD LITTLE GIRL THAT

1000
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I'LL NEVER FORGET.

1001
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
SO, NO, IT NEVER GOES AWAY.

1002
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
AND THE ONLY WAY YOU DO IS YOU

1003
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
JUST DETACH YOURSELF AND GET

1004
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
YOUR JOB DONE AND TRY TO GET

1005
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
OUT OF THERE.

1006
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
>> Judge Jeanine: WE BOTH KNOW

1007
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
IS WHAT YOU DO IS YOU CLOSE

1008
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
YOUR MIND OFF EMOTIONALLY.

1009
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
YOU BECOME THE DETECTIVE, I

1010
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
BECOME THE D.A.

1011
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
BUT IN THE QUIET OF THE NIGHT,

1012
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
MARK, YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT

1013
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
SCENE COMES BACK TO US OVER

1014
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
AND OVER AGAIN.

1015
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
NOW, MARC, I HAVE SPECIFICALLY

1016
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
NOT MENTIONED THE NAME OF THE

1017
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
SHOOTER.

1018
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I WOULDN'T GIVE HIM THAT.

1019
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I WOULDN'T GIVE HIM ANYTHING

1020
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
OTHER THAN WHAT HE DESERVES IF

1021
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
HE WERE TO LIVE.

1022
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
BUT, WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THE

1023
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
FACT THAT WE HAVE GOT SCHOOLS

1024
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
WHERE OUR CHILDREN ARE THAT

1025
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT

1026
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
THEM?

1027
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I MEAN, WHAT DO MOST SCHOOLS

1028
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
HAVE?

1029
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
SHOULD THERE BE ARMED GUARDS

1030
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
AT OUR SCHOOLS IN THE

1031
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS?

1032
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD

1033
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
HAPPEN?

1034
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
>> WELL, WE ADDRESS TERRORISM

1035
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
BY TRYING TO FORTIFY OR MAKE

1036
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
SOFT TARGETS HARD TARGETS.

1037
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO

1038
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
DO.
EVERYTHING ELSE CAN COME AFTER

1039
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
THAT.

1040
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
BUT YOU NEED TO MAKE IT AS

1041
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR

1042
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
SOMEBODY THAT'S NOT AUTHORIZED

1043
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
TO GET INTO ANY SCHOOL.

1044
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
THAT IS THE FIRST STEP.

1045
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
UNTIL THAT STEP IS MET, THEN

1046
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
YOU CAN'T GO FORWARD WITH A

1047
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
PLAINED CLOTHES POLICE OFFICER

1048
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
OR SECURITY OR ANYTHING ELSE

1049
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
EVEN TRAINING SOME OF THE

1050
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
TEACHER WHAT IS TO DO.

1051
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
YOU HAVE TO FIRST MAKE A

1052
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
BARRICADE.
AND MAKE IT A HARDER TARGET

1053
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW EVERY

1054
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
SUSPECT THAT WANTS TO COMMIT

1055
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE KNOWS

1056
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
THAT THEY WILL GET ON THE

1057
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
PROPERTY AND THEY WILL GET

1058
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
INSIDE.

1059
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
>> WELL, AND THAT'S THE HARD

1060
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
PART.
BUT YOU KNOW MAYBE WE NEED TO

1061
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
LEARN FROM THE SCHOOLS IN

1062
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
ISRAEL.
SCHOOLS IN IRELAND WHO HAVE

1063
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
ALL TAKEN PRECAUTIONS FOR

1064
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
THEIR CHILDREN AND, YOU KNOW,

1065
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
WE LIVE IN A FREE SOCIETY.

1066
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS ANY

1067
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
WAY TO PROTECT AGAINST.

1068
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
THIS MARK FUHRMAN THANKS SO

1069
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000

BROUGHT FOOD TO US.

8 YEARS OLD.
HE STAYED WITH US TWO AND A

1179
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000

THEM PAST THE HUMP.

1183
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
GETTING A DOG TO FOCUS ON FOR

1184
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000

SCHOOL OR THE SIBLINGS OF

CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN LOST.

1188
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
>> RED CROSS HAS STRESSED THE

1189
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
IMPORTANCE OF PARENTS TALKING

1190
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000

EDITION OF 9:00 OF JUSTICE.

1213
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
THE INTERCOM IN THE OFFICE

1214
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
WENT OFF AS IF THEY WERE GOING

1215
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
IT MAKE ANNOUNCEMENT.

1216
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
SCUFFLING NOISES.

1217
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I THOUGHT SOMEBODY HIT THE

1218
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
BUTTON BY MISTAKE AND THEY

1219
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
WERE IN THE OFFICE.

1220
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
ONE OF THE SECRETARIES

1221
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
ANSWERED THE PHONE AND SAID

1222
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
THERE WAS A SHOOTING.

1223
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
>> MAYHEM IN THE ROOM WITH ALL

1224
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
THE KIDS AND TEACHERS TRYING

1225
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
TO FIND YOUR KID.

1226
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
IDENTIFY WHERE YOURS IS AND

1227
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
MAKING SURE THEY ARE SAFE.

1228
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
FIND OUT WHAT THE SITUATION

1229
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
WAS.
>> SHE WAS IN A SMALL CLASS.

1230
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
A READING GROUP AND THEY

1231
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
STARTED HEARING, I GUESS,

1232
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
BANGS.

1233
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
AND HER TEACHER WHICH I'M SO

1234
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
GRATEFUL FOR, THERE WAS JUST A

1235
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
SMALL GROUP, THEY RUSHED THE

1236
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
KIDS INTO THE BATHROOM, AND

1237
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
THEY LOCKED THE DOOR.

1238
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
AND THEY JUST TOLD THE

1239
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
CHILDREN THAT IT WAS HAMMERING

1240
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
AND TRIED TO KEEP THEM CALM.

1241
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
THE NEXT THING I KNOW BECAUSE

1242
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET THE

1243
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
COMPLETE STORY.

1244
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
THE NEXT THING I KNOW IS THAT

1245
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
THE POLICE CAME IN AND THEY

1246
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
WERE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR TO

1247
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
BE LET OUT.

1248
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
OF THE CLASSROOM.

1249
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
AND WHEN THEY WERE, SHE HAD

1250
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
SEEN GLASS AND BLOOD.

1251
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
ONE CHILD WAS COVERED IN BLOOD

1252
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT CHILD IS

1253
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
SAFE AND WAS NOT HURT AND MUST

1254
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY ELSE'S.

1255
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
>> IT'S SHEAR TERROR AND A

1256
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
SENSE OF IMMEDIATE URGENCY.

1257
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
AND, YOU KNOW, TO GET TO YOUR

1258
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
CHILD AND TO BE THERE TO

1259
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
PROTECT THEM.

1260
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
>> 18 CHILDREN PRONOUNCED DEAD

1261
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
AT THE SCHOOL.

1262
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
THERE WERE TWO THAT WERE

1263
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
TRANSPORTED TO AREA HOSPITALS

1264
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
AND PRONOUNCED DEAD AT AREA

1265
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
HOSPITALS.
THERE WERE SIX ADULTS

1266
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE

1267
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
AT THE SCHOOL.

1268
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
>> WE HAVE ENDURED TOO MANY OF

1269
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
THESE TRAGEDIESED IN THE PAST

1270
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
FEW YEARS.

1271
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
AND EACH TIME I LEARN THE

1272
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
NEWS, I REACT NOT AS A

1273
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
PRESIDENT BUT AS ANYBODY ELSE

1274
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
WOULD, AS A PARENT.

1275
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE

1276
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
TODAY.
I KNOW THERE IS NOT A PARENT

1277
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
IN AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL

1278
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
THE SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF

1279
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
THAT I DO.

1280
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

1281
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

1282
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

1283
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS

1284
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
OLD.

1285
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

1286
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

1287
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

1288
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF THEIR OWN
