THIS IS LAKE COUNTY AREA.

455
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000

MUCH LIKE TODAY THE CHILL IS IN

483
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000

484
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000

494
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
A LITTLE BIT OF THIS AND A

495
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
LITTLE BIT OF THAT.

496
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000

DAVID LEE PLAYING OUT OF HIS

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
ALL-STAR CALIBER.

HE HAD 12 POINTS IN THIS GAME.

517
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
WIZARD FANS HAVE HAD NOT MUCH TO

FUNDAMENTALLY SOUND.

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
YOU ARE GOING TO BOX KOBE, I

523
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000

LAKERS STOP THE SKID 102-THE 6

525
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
BUT THEIR RECORD 10-14.

526
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
>> DE LaSALLE WILL FACE THEIR

527
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
OPPONENTS IN CARSON.

528
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
THIS COULD BE THE FINAL GAME AS

529
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
HEAD COACH FOR BOB LADASAUR WHO

530
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
IS CONSIDERING RETIREMENT.

531
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000

TEACHER.

533
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I WANTED TO BE AT THIS SCHOOL.

534
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
THAT IS WHEN I WAS 24 YEARS OLD.

535
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
IT NEVER CHANGED.

536
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
IT'S BEEN VERY REWARDING AND

537
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
BEEN A VERY GOOD CAREER.

538
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I HAVE NO REGRETS WHATSOEVER.

539
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
>> A HUGE UPSET IN THE DIVISION

540
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
ONE CHAMPIONSHIP TONIGHT.

541

HE FIGHTS HIS WAY TO THE END

546
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
ZONE.

547
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
HE MISSED THE EXTRA POINT SO

548
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
THEY WERE UP ONLY BY 6.

549
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
THEY ANSWER WITH JOHN COOLY.

550
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
THEY MADE THE EXTRA POINT.

551
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
THAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE.

552
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
GRANITE RANKED 92nd THE NATION

553
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
DEFEATS TEAM THAT RATED 12th AND

554
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
WAS HEAVY FAVORITE, 21-20 WAS

555
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
THE FINAL.
THAT WAS A THRILLER.

556
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
ABC7 SPORTS BROUGHT TO YOU BY
