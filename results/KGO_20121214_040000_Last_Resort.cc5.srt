00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
GET ME THROUGH THE BLOCKADE.

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
THEY'VE TAKEN HER SOMEWHERE,
AND I'M GONNA FIND HER.

IF IT TAKES A WEEK, THEN--

IT WON'T TAKE A WEEK.
IT CAN'T.

NOW YOU OWE ME NOTHING, SAM,
AND YOU NEVER HAVE.

YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

10

DAMN, SON.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I FIGURED YOU FOR SHARK CHUM
BY NOW.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
(chuckles) EASY, MAN.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I FORGOT WHAT
A DELICATE FLOWER YOU ARE.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
YOU KNOW, YOUR FRIEND...

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
COME ON INSIDE.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
SO THIS IS WHAT YOU LEFT
THE PARTY FOR?

IT'S, UH, GREAT.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
WELL, IT BEATS THAT MARK V

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
WE SPENT EIGHT DAYS ON
IN THE GULF.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
NO.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
THIS IS WHY I LEFT
THE PARTY.

WES, MY FRIEND HERE--

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
HOLD ON A SECOND, OKAY?

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
SWEETIE, CAN YOU TAKE CHARLIE
FOR A WALK?

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
THAT OKAY WITH YOU, KID?
YOU WANT TO GO

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
TO THE PARK WITH YOUR MOM,
GET SOME ICE CREAM?

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
MM-HMM.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
IT'S OKAY.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
(door opens)

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
THINKING, BRINGING HIM HERE?

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
LISTEN...
HUH?

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I KNOW IT'S A BIG ASK.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I WOULDN'T BE HERE
IF IT WASN'T IMPORTANT.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
WE NEED SOME INFORMATION,
AND THEN WE ARE GONE.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
YOU DO KNOW YOU'RE PUBLIC ENEMY
NUMBER TWO, RIGHT?
YES, I DO.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
AND YOU COME TO MY HOUSE
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
NOW YOU WANT ME TO OPEN UP
OLD SOURCES?

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
THEY'VE GOT MY WIFE.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
SHE WAS RENDITIONED
TWO DAYS AGO

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
OFF THE THE ISLAND
OF SAINTE MARINA.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
MANILA'S THE CLOSEST
WAY STATION.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
WAIT. HOLD ON A SECOND.
TWO DAYS AGO?

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
LOOK, I'M SORRY, MAN.
SHE'S ALREADY GONE.

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
OH, NO.
DON'T--DON'T--DON'T--

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
DON'T TELL ME SHE'S GONE.
SHE'S NOT GONE.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
RENDITION LIKE THIS
USUALLY TAKES

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
AT LEAST THREE DAYS
TO ARRANGE TRANSFER.

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
THAT MEANS I GOT ABOUT 12 HOURS
BEFORE THEY THROW HER

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
IN SOME HOLE SOMEWHERE.
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
YEAH. WELL, GOOD LUCK
WITH THAT.
HEY.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I SUGGEST YOU TELL YOUR FRIEND

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
TO TAKE HIS DAMN HANDS
OFF ME.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'M SORRY IF THIS IS
INCONVENIENT FOR YOU,

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
BUT THEY GOT MY WIFE.

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
SO IF YOU CAN HELP US,

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY
OF LETTING YOU SAY NO.

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I HAVE A WIFE, TOO.
OKAY.

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
OKAY? AND A KID
ON TOP OF THAT.

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
ANYBODY FIND OUT I MADE
CONTACT WITH YOU,

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I AM BACK ON THE GRID.

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'M JUST TRYING TO PROTECT
MY FAMILY, SAME AS YOU.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
(sighs) OH, MAN.

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
(exhales) YOU REALLY STOLE
A U.S. BOOMER?

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
IT SORT OF JUST HAPPENED,
YEAH.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
(laughs)

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
(sighs deeply)

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
OKAY.

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
JUST... LOOK...

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
10K FOR BRIBES.

82
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
AND THEN THERE'S CASH FOR
ACCESS, EQUIPMENT, EXTRACTION.

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I MEAN, I'M GUESSING YOU GUYS
DON'T HAVE 50 BUCKS BETWEEN YOU.

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
YEAH, YOU'D BE SURPRISED
WHAT I CAN GET MY HANDS ON.

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
(people speaking indistinctly)

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
YOU. MOVE THE CRATES.

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
LET'S GO.

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
ME? I DON'T WANT ANYTHING.

90
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'M JUST A BAGGAGE HANDLER.

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
YOU WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT.

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
THEY PAY ME,

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
BUT I WOULDN'T SAY
I WORK FOR 'EM.

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
HERE.

95
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
GET CLEANED UP
BEFORE THE TRANSFER.

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
TRANSFER TO WHERE?

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
ABOVE MY PAY GRADE.

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
ONCE YOU'RE
OUT OF THIS BUILDING,

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
YOU'RE SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROBLEM.

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHO I AM?

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I WATCH THE NEWS.

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
SIX HOURS.

103
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
YOU LEAVE IN SIX HOURS.

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
(pants)

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
(sniffles and cries)

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
(alarm sounding)

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
(radio clicks)

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
CAPTAIN MARCUS CHAPLIN
IS HERE NOW.

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
(click)

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
(man) Captain Marcus Chaplin,

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I am Zheng Li, special envoy

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
from the People's Republic
of China.

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It is China's understanding
that the current embargo

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
has eradicated your food
and medical supplies.

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The government of China
considers this

116
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
a humanitarian crisis,

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and I wish to come
to your shores.

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
TROJAN HORSE?

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
WE HAVE TO ASSUME SO.

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
(click)

121
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
PERMISSION TO COME ASHORE
GRANTED, MR. ZHENG.

122
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
(clicks)

123
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
(beeping)

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
U.S. VESSELS NOT ENGAGING.

125
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
SO MAYBE THE BLOCKADE
ISN'T A BLOCKADE

126
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
IF A COUNTRY LIKE CHINA
SAYS IT ISN'T.

127
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
GRACE, ORGANIZE A CONTINGENT
TO GREET MR. ZHENG.

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
THEY MAY COME IN PEACE,
BUT LET'S BE PREPARED.

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
YES, SIR.

130
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
(panting)

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
(groans)

132
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
OHH!

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
(grunts)

134
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
(exhales deeply)

135
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
(pants)

136
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
(motor whirring)

137
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
HE'LL BOW SLIGHTLY,

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
AND THEN YOU'LL SHAKE HANDS.

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
END OF MEETING.

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
SORRY, SIR.

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I LEARNED IT FROM MY DAD
WHEN HE WAS AN ENVOY IN CHINA.

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I WASN'T SURE
YOU KNEW THE PROTOCOL.

143
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
WELCOME TO SAINTE MARINA.

144
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.
I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE.

145
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL ISLAND.

146
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
PLEASE.

147
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
(pants)

148
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
OH. (exhales)

149
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
(brakes squeal)

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
(turns off engine)

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
HAWKES?

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
(jeep door closes)

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
ONE MOMENT.

154
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
MY SISTER'S DEAD.

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
YES.

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'M SORRY.

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'M A DESERTER.

158
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I LEFT THE LIEUTENANT
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIREFIGHT.

159
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
YOU'RE GONNA ARREST ME
AND STRIP ME OF MY RANK, RIGHT?

160
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
SO WHY ARE YOU EVEN BOTHERING
TO TALK ABOUT HER?

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
BECAUSE I'M TRULY SORRY
SHE'S DEAD.

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
DON'T ACT LIKE YOU CARE
ABOUT HER, MAN.

163
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
DON'T DO THAT.

164
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'M GOING.

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
PETTY OFFICER HAWKES,
STOP.

166
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
SON, I'M SORRY.

167
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
BUT YOU ARE CHARGED
WITH DESERTION

168
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
AND CONDUCT UNBECOMING.

169
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
PETTY OFFICER BRANNAN.

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
SIR.
ARREST THIS MAN.

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
CHARLIE.

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
THAT WAS MY DAD'S
DAD'S NAME.

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I NEVER MET HIM.

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
SAY, CHARLIE.

176
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
PLAY NOW WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
OKAY.

178
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
GOOD JOB, KID.

179
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
(exhales deeply)

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
HOW LONG

AND A RICH PARMESAN SAUCE.

720

NOW THAT'S BETTER.

721
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
He is a good little monkey
and always very curious.

722
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
One day George got an important
letter...

723
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
He's built a rocket ship to
travel into space.

724
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's just the right size for a
clever monkey.

725
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Do you want to go into space,
George?

726
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You will have to be very brave.

727
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Hi, Grandma!

728
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Oh hi,. my little monkey!

729
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000

730
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Thank you very much.

731

You're welcome.

732
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Everyone got on and they were
off to the launching site.

733
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Google, how far is Earth to the
Moon?

734
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Moon is 238,900 miles...

735
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
The great moment had come...

IF YOU AND I WERE ON
THE SAME SIDE, CAPTAIN,

742
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000

WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH.

WILL SEE WHAT YOU TRULY ARE.

WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE
DOES THAT SEND?

HOW DOES THAT HELP
TO GET US HOME?

DO WE SKITTER AROUND THE EDGES,
GATHERING CRUMBS,

I TALKED TO MY RHEUMATOLOGIST

Enbrel CAN HELP RELIEVE
