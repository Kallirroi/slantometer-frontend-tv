1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
COLLECT A SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I MEAN, HIS MOTHER HAS BEEN

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
DESCRIBED BY SOME AS A

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
COLLECTOR.
WHY WOULD SOMEONE HAVE THAT KIND

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
OF A GUN?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I MEAN, THE THING IS MASSIVE

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
LOOKING.
>> THE BUSHMASTER, ACTUALLY, IS

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
ONE USED BY THE BELTWAY SNIPERS.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
BUT IT IS -- IT'S CONSIDERED A

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
SPORTING WEAPON.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
SOME PEOPLE SAY IT LOOKS LIKE AN

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
ASSAULT WEAPON, LOOKS LIKE A

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
MILITARY WEAPON.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
BUT IT HAS CHARACTERISTICS THAT

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
MAKE IT SUITABLE FOR SPORTING

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
PURPOSES.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
THEREFORE, IT WAS NEVER BANNED

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
UNDER THE OLD ASSAULT WEAPON

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
BAN, NOR IS IT BANNED BY THE

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
CONNECTICUT ASSAULT WEAPON BAN.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
BUT AS FAR AS WHY SOMEBODY WOULD

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
WANT ONE OF THESE, A LOT OF

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
PEOPLE JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
HAVE ONE.

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
SOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S SEXY TO

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
HAVE ONE OF THESE THINGS.

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
SOME PEOPLE FEEL IT'S FOR SELF

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
PROTECTION.

29
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
BUT IT'S WITHIN THE LAW TO HAVE

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
ONE SO PEOPLE FEEL THEY CAN DO

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
THAT.
>> MIKE BUSHARD WITH US THIS

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000

SHE HIT HER HEAD AFTER SHE

FAINTED.
HER OFFICE SAYS CLINTON WAS

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
DEHYDRATED FROM A STOMACH VIRUS.

41
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000

FOLLOWING HER DOCTOR'S

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
RECOMMENDATIONS.
CLINTON WILL NOT TESTIFY AS HAD

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
BEEN SCHEDULED THURSDAY ABOUT

PRESIDENT NELSON MANDELA IS

RECOVERING FROM SURGERY TO HAVE

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
GALLSTONES REMOVED.

51
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
MR. MANDELA HAS BEEN IN THE

52
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
HOSPITAL SINCE LAST WEEKEND DUE

53
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
TO A RECURRING LUNG INFECTION.

54
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
OFFICIALS SAY THE OPERATION

55
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
TODAY WAS A SUCCESS.

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
>>> IN EGYPT, PRESIDENT MOHAMED

MORSI CAST HIS BALLOT TODAY FOR

58
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
A NEW DRAFT CONSTITUTION.

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
VOTERS THERE DECIDING WHETHER

60
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
THE CONTROVERSIAL DOCUMENT WILL

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
GO INTO EFFECT.

62
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
THE DAYS LEADING UP TO TODAY'S

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
VOTE HAVE BEEN MARRED BY MANY

64
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
PROTESTS AND VIOLENCE.

65
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
BACK TO YOU, SOLEDAD.

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
>>> WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
REPORT THAT A RELATIVE OF THE

68
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
SHOOTER SAID THAT HE SUFFERED --

69
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
THE SHOOTER SUFFERED SOME,

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
QUOTE, KIND OF AUTISM.
WE WANT TO GET TO DR. MAC WH

71
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
WHIZNITSER, AN AUTISM EXPERT AT

72
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
A HOSPITAL IN CLEVELAND.
AND HE PROVIDED SOME MORE

73
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
CLARIFICATION FOR US ON THIS.

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.

75
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I APPRECIATE IT.

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I THINK THIS BRINGS US INTO A

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
CONVERSATION ABOUT MENTAL

78
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
ILLNESS AND ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
WHICH I GUESS IS DEVELOPMENTAL,

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
WHICH IS AUTISM.

81
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
MY NEPHEW IS AUTISTIC, SO I KNOW

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS.

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO WOULD

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
SAY, WELL, WHAT IS A KIND OF

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
AUTISM -- WHICH IS QUOTING THE

86
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
GENTLEMAN WHO APPARENTLY TOLD

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
INVESTIGATORS THAT ABOUT THE

88
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
SHOOTER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'S TALKING

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
ABOUT?
>> WELL, IF YOU LOOK AT THE

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
CLASSIC DEFINITION OF AUTISM OR

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER, IT'S A

92
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEM, WHICH
MEANS YOU'RE BORN WITH A

93
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
TENDENCY, BUT IT MAY SHOW ITSELF

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF LIFE.

95
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
IT'S A DEVELOPMENTAL PRONG THAT

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
AFFECTS YOUR SOCIALIZATION,

97
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
AFFECTS HOW YOU CAN COMMUNICATE

98
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
OR INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE

99
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
AND HAS ASSOCIATED WITH IT SOME

100
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
REPETITIVE BEHAVIORS OR MAJOR

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
AREAS OF FASCINATION OR

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
INTEREST.
MORE RECENTLY, PEOPLE HAVE

103
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
ACTUALLY TAKEN THIS TERMINOLOGY

104
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
AND EXPANDED THE CONCEPT OF

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER TO

106
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
REALLY SUGGEST PROBLEMS WITH

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
SOCIAL SKILLS OR SOCIAL BEHAVIOR

108
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
IN GENERAL.

109
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
SOMETIMES WITHOUT REALLY DIGGING

110
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
DOWN DEEP AND ASKING WHAT'S

111
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
DRIVING THEM.

112
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
AND I THINK IN THESE SITUATIONS,

113
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
WHEN SOMEONE MAKES THAT KIND OF

114
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
A STATEMENT, WE HAVE TO ASK ARE

115
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
THEY TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO

116
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
HAS REALLY BEEN ANALYZED AND

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
EVALUATED CAREFULLY WITH A

118
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
CLEARCUT DIAGNOSIS OR JUST A

119
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
LABEL BEING PUT ON BECAUSE IT'S

120
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
A LABEL OF CONVENIENCE?

121
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
>> SANJAY EARLIER WAS TELLING ME

122
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
THERE IS NO CORRELATION THAT HE

123
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
NO, SIR OF ANY STUDIES HE'S

124
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
LOOKED AT THAT WOULD INDICATE

125
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE AUTISTIC,

126
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
WHO HAVE AUTISM, MIGHT BE

127
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
CONNECTED WITH ANY KIND OF

128
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
VIOLENCE.

129
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
AND THAT MENTAL ILLNESS IS A

130
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CATEGORY.

131
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
AND I THINK SOMETIMES, FRANKLY,

132
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
PEOPLE USE THEM UNDER THE SAME

133
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
CATEGORY, AS YOU SAY, KIND OF

134
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
GLOM THEM UNDER THE SAME TITLE.

135
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE

136
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
SHOOTER.
THEY STILL HAVE NOT OFFICIALLY

137
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
IDENTIFIED HIM HERE IN NEWTOWN,

138
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
CONNECTICUT.

139
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
BUT I GUESS I'M TRYING TO

140
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
UNDERSTAND.

141
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
IS THERE -- DOES HE HAVE A

142
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
MENTAL ILLNESS, AND IS THIS

143
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE --
PEOPLE COULD KNOW ABOUT AND

144
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
NOT -- AND HE COULD HAVE BEEN

145
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
STRUGGLING TO GET TREATMENT?

146
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
>> LET'S FIRST GET TO YOUR FIRST

147
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
POINT, WHICH IS IN AUTISM,

148
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
BETWEEN 25 AND 50% OF

149
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
INDIVIDUALS CAN HAVE AGGRESSIVE

150
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
OR VIOLENT BEHAVIORS.
BUT IN THOSE SITUATIONS, IT'S

151
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
ALMOST ALWAYS REACTIVE.

152
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
EITHER SOMETHING HURTS THEM OR

153
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THEY DO SOMETHING IMPULSIVELY OR

154
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
BECAUSE THEY GET UPSET ABOUT

155
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
SOMETHING OR ANXIOUS OR MOODS

156
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
ARE NOT RIGHT.

157
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
IT'S REACTIVE, ON THE TIME AT

158
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
THAT SPOT.

159
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

160
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
SITUATION HERE WHERE SOMETHING

161
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
WAS PREPLANNED.

162
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
WAS DELIBERATELY THOUGHT OUT.

163
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
DROVE A DISTANCE TO DO IT.

164
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
AND BASICALLY TARGETED

165
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE CLEARLY

166
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
NOWHERE INVOLVED WITH ANYTHING

167
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
THAT'S GOING ON.

168
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THAT'S A DIFFERENT TYPE OF

169
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
AGGRESSION.

170
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
THAT'S NOT REACTIVE AGGRESSION.

171
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THAT'S MORE LIKE PREPLANNED

172
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
AGGRESSION THAT'S PRESENT.

173
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
THAT'S WHAT WE MAY SEE IN

174
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS.

175
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
AND IN INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL

176
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
ILLNESS, YOU DON'T FIND THE

177
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
FEATURES OF IT FOR THE FIRST

178
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
TIME ON THE DAY THEY DO SUCH A

179
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
HEINOUS ACTION SUCH AS THIS.

180
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
SUCH A BAD ACTION SUCH AS THIS.

181
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
THEY'RE SYMPTOMATIC FOR A LONG

182
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
PERIOD OF TIME BEFOREHAND WHEN

183
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
THINGS ARE BREWING.
WE HAVE TO ASK WHAT MADE HIM

184
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
BASICALLY GO OVER THE EDGE AND I

185
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
THINK AS YOU HAVE ASKED RIGHTLY,

186
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
COULD SOMETHING HAVE BEEN DONE

187
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
BEFORE HAPPENED?

188
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
FOR ALL WE KNOW HE MAY HAVE BEEN

189
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
UNDER SOME CARE BUT THINGS MAY

190
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
HAVE CHANGED IN THIS TIME

191
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
PERIOD.
WE NEED MORE INFORMATION.

192
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
>> DOCTOR, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

193
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
WE DO NEED MORE INFORMATION ON A

194
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
LOT OF FRONTS.
VERY LITTLE, AS I POINTED OUT,

195
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SHOOTER AT

196
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THIS POINT.

197
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT EVEN

198
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
IDENTIFYING HIM YET.

199
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
THEY SAY THEY WAIT FOR THE

200
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
POSTMORTEM TO DO THAT

201
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
OFFICIALLY.
BUT WE'RE BEGINNING TO GET A

202
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT

203
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
HIM.
AND SO WE'RE BRINGING IT TO YOU

204
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
AS WE GET IT.
WE'LL TAKE A SHORT BREAK.

205
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
AND WHEN HE COME BACK, WE'LL

206
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
CONTINUE TO BRING THE LATEST ON

207
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
THIS TERRIBLE, HORRIFIC SHOOTING

208
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
THAT HAPPENED AT A ELEMENTARY

209
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

IS THAT THIS IS A VERY HARD

STORY TO WRAP OUR HEADS AROUND.

227
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
WHY WOULD SOMEONE SHOOT UP AN

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

229
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
AND IMAGINE WHAT THE PARENTS HAD

230
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
TO BE GOING THROUGH WHEN THEY

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
GOT A ROBOCALL, TELLING THEM

232
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
THERE WAS A SHOOTING AND

233
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
LOCKDOWN AT THEIR KIDS' SCHOOL.

234
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
EARLIER THIS MORNING, I TALKED

235
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
TO THE PARENTS OF TWO CHILDREN

236
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
WHO WERE IN THAT SCHOOL.

237
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
THOSE TWO CHILDREN LOST THEIR

238
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
PRINCIPAL AND SOME OF THEIR

239
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
CLOSE FRIENDS ARE DEAD.

240
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
HERE'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME.

241
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
>> WHEN I SAW THOSE TEACHERS,

242
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
WHEN I FOUND THE TWO CHILDREN

243
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
AND WE ARE DEVASTATED AND

244
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
HEARTBROKEN FOR THE POOR

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
FAMILIES WHO DID NOT HAVE THAT

246
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
MOMENT IN THE FIREHOUSE OF

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
FINDING THEIR CHILDREN, AND WE

248
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

249
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
OUR PRAYERS.

250
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY IS

251
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
HEARTBROKEN.
BUT WHEN I SAW THOSE TEACHERS

252
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
AND I LOCKED EYES WITH EACH OF

253
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
THEM SEPARATELY, WHEN I FOUND

254
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
THE TWO CHILDREN, IF I COULD GO

255
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
BACK, I WOULD -- I WOULD EMBRACE

256
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
THEM.

257
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY

258
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
HAD GONE THROUGH.

259
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY HANDLED VERY

260
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
WELL, BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE

261
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
THE PANDEMONIUM THAT WOULD HAVE

262
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
BEEN GOING ON IN THAT FIREHOUSE,

263
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
FROM THE PARENTS SEARCHING FOR

264
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
THEIR CHILDREN.

265
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
IF ANYBODY THERE HAD ANY IDEA

266
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
THE LEVEL OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED

267
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
YESTERDAY, PEOPLE JUST SIMPLY

268
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
DIDN'T KNOW REALLY WHAT WAS

269
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
GOING ON.

270
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THEY JUST KNEW THAT THEIR

271
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
CHILDREN HAD BEEN IN A DANGEROUS

272
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
PLACE, AND THAT THOSE THAT MADE

273
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
IT TO THE FIREHOUSE WERE, THANK

274
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
GOD, SAFE.

275
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
>> WHAT ARE YOU TELL YOUR SON,

276
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
WHO IS A FIRST GRADER?

277
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
WHAT WILL YOU TELL YOUR DAUGHTER

278
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
WHO IS A THIRD GRADER?

279
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
DO THEY HAVE I DIDN'T ANY IDEA

280
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
OF HOW SCOPE OF HOW BAD IT IS?

281
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
>> I THINK THEY DO.

282
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
WE HAVEN'T REALLY LET ON.

283
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
WE HAVEN'T SAID MUCH.

284
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
THIS IS SHOCKING, SO THIS IS NEW

285
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
TO US.

286
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
AND WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO

287
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
TALK TO COUNSELORS TODAY OVER AT

288
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
THE REED SCHOOL.

289
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
WE'RE GOING TO LIVE AT OUR

290
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
CHURCH AT SAINT ROSE, AND WE'RE

291
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
JUST GOING TO LEARN WHAT TO SAY

292
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
BEFORE WE SAY IT.

293
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
IT'S REALLY TRICKY.

294
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
AND FOR MY THIRD GRADER, LITTLE

295
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
BITS AND PIECES ARE COMING OUT

296
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
NOW.
>> SHE'S HANDLING IT A LITTLE --

297
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE IS NOT

298
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
TALKING AS MUCH ABOUT IT.

299
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
>> NO.
LITTLE THINGS ARE COMING OUT

300
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
NOW, WHERE SHE -- SHE HEARD A

301
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
LOT.
THEY ALL HEARD AND SAW THINGS

302
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
THAT OUR CHILDREN SHOULD NOT

303
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
HEAR OR SEE.

304
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
AND SO WE JUST -- THEY KNOW THAT

305
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
IT WAS A BAD MAN.

306
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
AND WE SAID WE'RE JUST COMING TO

307
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
TALK TO PEOPLE.

308
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

309
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
OVER AT SANDY HOOK.

310
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
THEY DON'T KNOW -- THEY DON'T

311
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
KNOW THAT THEY'VE LOST THEIR

312
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
FRIENDS AND THEIR PRINCIPAL.

313
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
>> IT'S BECOME APPARENT THAT OUR

314
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
6-YEAR-OLD HAS LOST CLOSE

315
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
FRIENDS.
AND HE'S VERY UNAWARE OF THAT

316
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
RIGHT NOW.
WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXACTLY

317
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
APPROACH IT WITH HIM AT THIS

318
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
POINT.
THE WE'RE JUST KIND OF GUARDING

319
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
THEM FROM THE TV.

320
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
WHEN THEY FELL ASLEEP LAST

321
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
NIGHT, AND -- AND THE EXPERTS

322
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
WOULD COME ON THE TV TO DISCUSS

323
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
HOW YOU TALK TO YOUR CHILDREN,

324
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
WE WERE VERY ATTENTIVE.

325
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
LIKE, OH, LET'S LISTEN, OR LET'S

326
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
WATCH THIS.

327
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
AND WE REALIZED WATCHING IT, IT

328
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH US.

329
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
IT HAD EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE

330
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
REST OF THE COUNTRY WATCHING IT.

331
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
BUT NOT THE PEOPLE THAT WERE

332
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
INVOLVED AND THE CHILDREN THAT

333
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
WERE ACTUALLY IN THE SCHOOL.

334
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO --

335
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
WE REALIZE, AS THIS GOES ON,

336
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TAKE

337
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
ADVANTAGE OF THE COUNSELING.
>> MANY PEOPLE HAVE SENT

338
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
MESSAGES TO ME TO TELL PEOPLE

339
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
LIKE YOU AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

340
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
LOST THEIR CHILDREN JUST SORRY

341
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
THEY FEEL FOR THEM.

342
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
>> YEAH, I MEAN, YOUR HEART --

343
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
THIS IS A FEELING -- IT IS

344
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
UNSPEAKABLE.

345
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
IT IS LIKE REACHING INTO YOUR

346
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
INSIDES AND PULLING THEM OUT.

347
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I MEAN, WHEN THINGS HAPPEN TO

348
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
YOUR CHILDREN, AND TO OTHER

349
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
PEOPLE -- I MEAN, I CAN'T LOOK

350
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
AT MY CHILDREN'S FACES NOW

351
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
WITHOUT SEEING THE FACES OF

352
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
EVERY ONE OF THEIR SCHOOL MATES.

353
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
AND ALL OF THEIR FRIENDS.

354
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE

355
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
DOING RIGHT NOW OR SAYING OR

356
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
TALKING ABOUT CHRISTMAS AND JUST

357
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
THINKING -- THEIR FRIENDS SHOULD

358
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
ALL BE HERE.
AND IT'S JUST -- IT IS SUCH --

359
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
IT IS SO HEAVY.

360
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
SO HEAVY ON YOUR HEART.

361
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
AND --

362
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
>> THE NATION FEELS THAT WAY

363
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
TOO.
>> YEAH.

364
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
THE OUTPOURING OF LOVE HAS BEEN

365
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
TREMENDOUS.
I MEAN, PEOPLE ARE CALLING FROM

366
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

367
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED THAT

368
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
NOW.
WE'RE GOING TO ABSOLUTELY NEED

369
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
THAT TO BE THERE AS A COMMUNITY.

370
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
WE LOVE SANDY HOOK.

371
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I MEAN, THIS IS SUCH A GREAT

372
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
PLACE.
AND THE PEOPLE ARE WONDERFUL.

373
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO

374
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
REALLY EMBRACE EACH OTHER AND

375
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
OPEN OUR HEARTS AND OPEN OUR

376
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
ARMS AND OPEN THOSE CHURCH DOORS

377
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
AND JUST GET EVERYBODY PRAYING

378
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
AND TOGETHER.

379
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
BECAUSE I MEAN, I THINK THIS IS

380
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
SOMETHING WE WILL GET THROUGH.

381
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SOMETHING

382
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
WE WILL EVER, EVER GET OVER.

383
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
>> I WOULD LIKE -- I WOULD LIKE

384
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
ALSO TO SAY THAT WE ALWAYS FELT

385
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
BLESSED THAT OUR CHILDREN WERE

386
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
AT SANDY HOOK SCHOOL.

387
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
IT WAS AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL

388
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
SCHOOL, FANTASTIC EDUCATORS.

389
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
THE PRINCIPAL WHO, GOD BLESS

390
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
HER, LOST HER LIFE, WAS JUST --

391
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
A VERY SPECIAL PERSON.

392
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
AND ALL THE PARENTS KNEW THAT.

393
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
SO IT'S A VERY -- IT'S SHOCKING

394
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
BEYOND BELIEF THAT THIS HAS

395
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
HAPPENED.
AND IT'S -- I MEAN, WE'RE JUST

396
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
GRIEF-STRICKEN, HEARTBROKEN FOR

397
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
THOSE FAMILIES.

398
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
>> THE PHELPS FAMILY, WITH TWO

399
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
CHILDREN, A FIRST GRADER AND A

400
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
THIRD GRADER.

401
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
GRAPPLING NOW WITH HOW TO DEAL

402
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
WITH THIS AFTERMATH AND FEELING

403
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
SO LUCKY AT THE SAME TIME.

404
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
THEIR CHILDREN WERE AMONG THE

405
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
SURVIVORS OF THIS HORRIFIC,

406
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
HORRIFIC SHOOTING.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE TO TALK

407
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
ABOUT AS WE CONTINUE.

408
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
THOSE CHILDREN WERE AT THE
SCHOOL AT THE TIME OF THE

409
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
SHOOTING, CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT

410
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
TO TALK ABOUT AND QUESTIONS

411
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO ASK AND

412
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
ANSWER AS THEY WOULD LIKE TO GET

413
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
ANSWERED.

414
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
LET'S GET TO DOCTOR JEFF

415
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
GARDERE.

416
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
HE HAS BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT

417
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
WHAT ANSWERS PARENTS NEED TO BE

418
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
GIVING THEIR CHILDREN.

419
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
HE'S A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST.

420
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
SO, JEFF, I DID THAT INTERVIEW

421
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
WITH THE -- THOSE PARENTS A

422
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
LITTLE BIT EARLIER TODAY.

423
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
AND THEY WERE STRUGGLING.

424
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
THEY LITERALLY DID NOT KNOW THE

425
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
WORDS TO USE TO BE ABLE TO TELL

426
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
THEIR FIRST GRADE SON THAT SOME

427
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
OF HIS CLASSMATES AND HIS GOOD

428
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
FRIENDS HAD BEEN KILLED.

429
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
HOW DO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE

430
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
SITUATION HANDLE THIS?

431
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
HOW DO THOSE OF US WHO ARE

432
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
OUTSIDE OF IT AND HAVE CHILDREN

433
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
THAT ARE DEALING WITH IT HANDLE

434
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
IT AS WELL?

435
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
>> WELL, I HEARD WHAT THEY SAID,

436
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
AND IT WAS VERY POIGNANT.

437
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
THEY HAD LISTENED TO THE EXPERTS

438
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
SUCH AS MYSELF GIVING ADVICE.

439
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN WHO HAVE
HEARD ABOUT THIS, HOW TO SPEAK

440
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
WITH THEM.
THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL

441
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
POPULATION.

442
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE AT THE

443
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
GROUND ZERO WHO HAVE BEEN

444
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
TRAUMATIZED.
AND I WOULD TELL THOSE PARENTS,

445
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
AND THIS IS SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU

446
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
THERE IN CONNECTICUT, AS PART OF

447
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
SANDY HOOK.

448
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS LET

449
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
YOUR CHILDREN KNOW THAT YOU, AS

450
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
THE PARENTS, HAVE BEEN VERY HURT

451
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
BY THIS.

452
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
AND THAT YOU WANT TO CRY, AND

453
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
IT'S OKAY TO CRY.

454
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
AND IT'S OKAY TO GRIEVE.

455
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
BUT MOST IMPORTANT, THEY, AS THE

456
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
PARENTS, SOLEDAD, HAVE TO

457
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
PROVIDE THE STABILITY OF JUST

458
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
BEING THERE WITH THEIR CHILDREN,

459
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
HUGGING THEM, HOLDING THEM,

460
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
LETTING THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE

461
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
SAFE RIGHT NOW, AND JUST

462
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
LISTENING TO WHATEVER IT IS THAT

463
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
THOSE CHILDREN WANT TO SAY.

464
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
AND JUST BEING THAT EAR MORE

465
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

466
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
>> IS IT YOUR EXPECTATION THAT

467
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
EVERYONE IN THIS COMMUNITY OR --

468
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
WILL HAVE PTSD?

469
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
OR WILL IT JUST BE THOSE THAT

470
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
HAD CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL

471
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
SYSTEM?

472
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
CAN PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T EXPERIENCE

473
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
IT BUT ARE EXPERIENCING IT FROM

474
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
A DISTANCE ALSO GET PTSD?

475
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
>> WELL, I WOULD SAY THAT THE

476
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE PART OF THE

477
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
SCHOOL, PART OF THAT COMMUNITY,

478
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE

479
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
STATISTICS.
YOU'VE HEARD IT FROM DR. SANJAY

480
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
GUPTA.
THERE'S ALMOST A 70% PROBABILITY

481
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
THAT THEY WILL HAVE SOME SORT OF

482
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
PTSD.

483
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
IT WILL LAST FOR MONTHS, IF NOT

484
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
YEARS.

485
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
HOWEVER, THE IMPORTANT THING IS

486
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
THE MOBILE CRISIS UNITS ARE

487
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
THERE.

488
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
TRAINED POLICE OFFICERS, SOCIAL

489
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
WORKERS ARE THERE.

490
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
SO THE QUICKER YOU ADDRESS THE

491
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
ISSUES AND LET THEM SPEAK ABOUT

492
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
THIS, THE BETTER THE PROGNOSIS

493
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
IN THE FUTURE.

494
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
FOR THOSE PARENTS WHO ARE

495
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
DEALING WITH THEIR KIDS, WHO ARE

496
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
OUTSIDE OF THAT COMMUNITY, THE

497
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU

498
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
LISTEN TO WHAT IT IS THAT THEY

499
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
KNOW.
ASK THEM WHAT THEY KNOW.

500
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
ASK THEM WHAT THEY WANT TO

501
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
DISCUSS.
AND IT'S NOT ONE CONVERSATION,

502
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
SOLEDAD.
IT'S A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS

503
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
WHILE YOU'RE DOING THINGS THAT

504
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
THEY ENJOY.

505
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
JUST BE THERE AND LISTEN TO WHAT

506
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
IT IS THAT THEY HAVE TO SAY, AND

507
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE

508
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
SAFE IN THEIR SCHOOLS.

509
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES, BUT

510
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
EMPOWER THEM WITH THE KNOWLEDGE

511
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
THEY CAN BE STRONG AND THEY CAN

512
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
SYMPATHIZE AND EMPATHIZE WITH

513
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
THOSE CHILDREN THAT HAVE LOST

514
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
THEIR LIVES.
BUT AS FOR THEM AND THEIR

515
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
FAMILIES, WE ARE THERE FOR THEM.

516
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
THE STABILITY IS THERE.

517
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
>> DR. JEFF GARDERE.

518
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
JEFF, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE

519
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
INFORMATION, THE ADVICE.

520
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
WE APPRECIATE IT.

521
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
AND WE'RE LEARNING SOME NEW

522
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
DETAILS ABOUT THE SUSPECTED

523
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
SHOOTER'S MOTHER, NANCY LANZA.

524
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
WE ARE TOLD THAT SHE LIKED TO

525
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
GARDEN, SHE PLAYED A DICE GAME

526
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
CALLED BUNKO WITH HER

527
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
GIRLFRIENDS.

528
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
A NEIGHBOR SAID THE LANZAS

529
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
LOOKED LIKE A NICE AND NORMAL

530
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
FAMILY.
POLICE SAY, THOUGH, THAT NANCY'S

531
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
SON, THE SHOOTER, KILLED HER IN

532
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
HER NEWTON HOME BEFORE HE WENT

533
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
ON TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

534
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
AND CNN'S DAVID ARIESTO JOINS ME

535
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
NOW.
YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO

536
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE NOT ONLY

537
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
IS IT CENTER OF AN

538
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
INVESTIGATION.
THERE ARE MANY NEIGHBORS WHO

539
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT THE FAMILY,

540
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
AS WELL.

541
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
WHAT ARE THEY TELLING YOU?

542
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
>> YOU SPEAK TO NEIGHBORS, IT

543
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
PAINTS A PICTURE OF THIS AFLUENT

544
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
COMMUNITY THAT IS IN

545
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
SOUTHWESTERN CONNECTICUT.

546
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
AND IT'S -- THIS WOMAN WHO OFTEN

547
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
WOULD BE WITH HER BOYS, THEY

548
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
MOVED TO THE AREA IN 1998.

549
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
THE -- SHE DIVORCED WITH HER

550
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
HUSBAND YEARS LATER.

551
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
BUT THEY WOULD OFTEN ATTEND

552
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
THESE PARTIES, THESE DICE GAMES

553
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
IN WHICH THEY WERE GARDENING IN

554
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
THE BACK AND TALK ABOUT

555
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
LANDSCAPING.
THE COMMON JOKE THAT ONE OF THE

556
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
NEIGHBORS MENTIONED, YOU'RE

557
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
DOING ALL THIS LANDSCAPING

558
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
BEHIND THE HOUSE, NOBODY IS

559
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
GOING TO SEE THIS.

560
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
BUT IT WAS THIS IDEA THAT THIS

561
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
WOMAN WAS A -- A PLEASANT,

562
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
PLEASURABLE PERSON TO BE AROUND.

563
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
SHE WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS INVOLVED

564
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
IN THE COMMUNITY.
AND YOU TALK TO RESIDENTS HERE,

565
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
AND IT'S REALLY -- THIS SENSE OF

566
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
THIS TIGHT KNIT COMMUNITY.

567
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
WE TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE EARLIER

568
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
IN THE DAY, AND MANY PEOPLE SAY

569
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
THAT PEOPLE MOVE TO THIS AREA

570
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
BECAUSE OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM.

571
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
SO TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS

572
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
TAKE PLACE AT A SCHOOL,

573
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
PARTICULARLY IN AN ELEMENTARY

574
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
SCHOOL, HAS JUST ROCKED THIS

575
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
COMMUNITY.
>> THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO

576
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
ASK THE QUESTION WHY.

577
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
WERE NEIGHBORS ABLE TO TELL YOU

578
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
ANYTHING ABOUT THE BOYS IN THE

579
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
FAMILIAR LYRICS , SPECIFICALLY

580
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
THE YOUNG MAN WHO WOULD GO ON TO

581
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
BE THE SHOOTER.

582
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THEY

583
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
MENTIONED, THEY DIDN'T SEE THE

584
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
BOYS.
THEY MOVED THERE IN 1998 AND

585
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
LIVED THERE REALLY UP UNTIL THIS

586
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
WEEK.

587
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
THE FATHER DIVORCED YEARS LATER.

588
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
BUT THE BOYS WERE NOT

589
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
INDIVIDUALS THEY SAW VERY OFTEN.

590
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
AND THIS PICTURE THAT YOU ALSO

591
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
GET IS THAT YOU HAVE THIS ONE

592
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
INDIVIDUAL WHO IS GARDENING AND

593
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
PLAYING CARDS AND PLAYING DICE.

594
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
AND AT THE SAME TIME, YOU HAVE

595
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
WHAT APPEARS TO BE SEVERAL GUNS

596
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
WITHIN THIS HOUSE, SOME OF THOSE

597
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
GUNS BEING HIGH-POWERED WEAPONS.

598
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
SO IT'S THIS CONFLICTING

599
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
ACCOUNT.

600
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
AND ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS

601
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
PROBABLY SAID IT BEST.

602
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING HERE.

603
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
>> IT'S INTERESTING.

604
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
IT APPEARS, RIGHT, SHE WOULD BE

605
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
A COLLECTOR, SOME OF THE PEOPLE

606
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
WE HAVE SPOKEN TO, WHEN YOU LOOK

607
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
AT THE CALIBER OF THE GUNS AND

608
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
THE RANGE, THE KINDS OF WEAPONS

609
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
SHE HAD, SHE WOULD BE A

610
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
COLLECTOR.
DID THE NEIGHBORS TALK ABOUT HER

611
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
PASSION FOR COLLECTING WEAPONS

612
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
AT ALL?
DID THEY KNOW ABOUT IT?

613
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
>> YOU KNOW, I ASKED THAT

614
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
QUESTION SPECIFICALLY AND

615
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
CATEGORICALLY, EACH NEIGHBOR I

616
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
TALKED TO SAID NO.

617
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
SO IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT PAINTS A

618
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
BIT OF A CONFUSING PICTURE WHEN

619
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
YOU HAVE THESE TYPE OF WEAPONS

620
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
THAT APPARENTLY WERE HERS.

621
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
AND WERE USED IN THIS TERRIBLE

622
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
TRAGEDY.
>> CRAZY.

623
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
SO THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT

624
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
EARLY ON WHEN THIS STORY BROKE,

625
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
THERE WAS WORD SHE WAS A TEACHER

626
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
IN THE SCHOOL.

627
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
AND WE NOW KNOW THAT WAS NOT THE

628
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
CASE.
SHE WAS NOT A TEACHER IN THE

629
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
SCHOOL, BUT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE

630
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
SOME AFFILIATION WITH THE

631
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
SCHOOL.

632
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO LEARN

633
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
ON THAT FRONT?
>> YOU KNOW, WHEN SHE

634
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
DIVORCED -- THERE WAS

635
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
SPECULATION WITHIN THE COMMUNITY

636
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE USED HER

637
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
MAIDEN NAME AND MAY HAVE DONE

638
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
SOME SUBSTITUTE TEACHING.

639
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH BATTED DOWN

640
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
BY MOST OF THE SCHOOL

641
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
AUTHORITIES WE TALKED TO AND

642
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
OTHERS.
SO IT WAS REALLY UNCLEAR WHAT

643
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
SHE WAS DOING.

644
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
SHE CERTAINLY HAD TAKEN SOME

645
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
TIME OFF AFTER WORKING IN

646
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
FINANCE.
AND SHE HAD ESSENTIALLY GOT VERY

647
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
MUCH INTO GARDENING.

648
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
VERY MUCH INTO LANDSCAPING.

649
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
WHAT HER CONNECTION WAS WITH THE

650
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
SCHOOL, IF ANY, IS UNCLEAR.

651
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
>> IT IS SUCH -- SO MANY

652
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED.

653
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH

654
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
CONTRADICTORY INFORMATION

655
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
THROUGHOUT -- REALLY, IT'S BEEN

656
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
WHAT, 30-PLUS HOURS NOW THAT

657
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
WE'VE BEEN COVERING THIS STORY.

658
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
AND THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS

659
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
AND SO FEW ANSWERS ABOUT THE

660
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
SHOOTER, HIS FAMILY.

661
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
ANY MOTIVATION.

662
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
YOU KNOW, I GUESS AS LAW

663
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
ENFORCEMENT SAYS, THEY WILL

664
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
RELEASE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT

665
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
HIM AS SOON AS THEY'RE DONE WITH

666
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
THAT MOST MORE ITEM, WHICH WILL

667
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
BE TOMORROW MORNING.

668
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE

669
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
REPORT.

670
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
NO DOUBT, THOUGH, HERE TODAY SO

671
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
MANY PEOPLE ARE OVERWHELMED WITH

672
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
SO MUCH PAIN.

673
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
JUST TO TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE

674
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
STREETS WHO HAVE COME TO THE

675
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
MAKESHIFT MEMORIALS WHERE

676
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
THEY'RE LAYING FLOWERS OR

677
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
LIGHTING VOTE ACTIVE CANDLES,

678
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
MISSING THE LOVED ONES, PEOPLE

679
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
THEY KNOW THEY HAVE LOST, TRYING

680
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENED.

681
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF

682
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS PROBABLY IS

683
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
IMPOSSIBLE.

684
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
>> THIS IS A VERY, VERY TRAGIC,

685
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
TRAGIC SCENE FOR EVERYBODY.

686
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
CERTAINLY OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN

687
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
FOR THE FAMILIES HERE.

688
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
>> WELL, ABOUT 9:30, 9:40, WE

689
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
HEARD NOISES AND THE

690
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM WAS STILL ON

691
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
SO -- IT DIDN'T GO OFF, SO YOU

692
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
HEAR WHAT SOUNDED LIKE POPS,

693
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
GUNSHOTS.

694
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
>> YOU HEARD A TEACHER MANAGED

695
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
TO TAKE TWO CHILDREN OUT OF THE

696
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
HALLWAY, PULL THEM INTO THE

697
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
CLASSROOM, LOCK THE DOOR, AND

698
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
MOVE EVERYBODY OVER TO THE OTHER

699
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
SIDE OF THE ROOM.

700
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
>> WE JUST TOLD A LITTLE BOY

701
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
ABOUT HIS SISTER NOW, JUST AS --

702
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
WHO AM I GOING TO PLAY WITH, HE

703
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
SAID.
I HAVE NOBODY TO PLAY WITH, HE

704
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
SAID.

705
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
>> WHEN YOUR FIRST GRADER GOES

706
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
TO BED AND SAYS "MOMMY, IS

707
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
ANYONE FROM MY CLASS LAST YEAR,

708
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
ARE THEY OKAY?
ARE THEY ALL OKAY?"

709
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
AND YOU LOOK AT THEM AND SAY I'M

710
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
NOT REALLY SURE.

711
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
>> YOU CAN NEVER BE PREPARED FOR

712
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
THIS KIND OF INCIDENT.

713
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
WHAT HAS HAPPENED, WHAT HAS

714
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
TRANSPIRED AT THAT SCHOOL

715
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
BUILDING WILL LEAVE A MARK ON

716
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
THIS COMMUNITY, AND EVERY FAMILY

717
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
IMPACTED.

718
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
>> WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF

719
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
WRAPPING UP OUR COVERAGE RIGHT

720
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
NOW, BUT WE'RE GOING TO

721
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
CONTINUE, OBVIOUSLY, CNN'S

722
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
COVERAGE OF THIS TRAGEDY IN

723
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

724
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
DEB FEYERICK, THERE ARE SO MANY

725
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
QUESTIONS YET TO BE ANSWERED.

726
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
WE'LL KNOW MORE TOMORROW,

727
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
CERTAINLY, WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT

728
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
TELLS US AND THE MEDICAL

729
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
EXAMINER'S OFFICE TELLS US.

730
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
THAT THEY WILL FINISH THE

731
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
POSTMORTEMS THAT WILL BE DONE ON

732
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
THE SHOOTER AND HIS MOTHER.

733
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
AND THAT WILL BRING AN END TO

734
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
THE -- I GUESS THE INVESTIGATION

735
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
INTO THE BODIES, AT LEAST, AT

736
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
THE CRIME SCENE.

737
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
>> SURE.
AND THE THING IS ALSO, PEOPLE

738
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
ARE SAYING, WELL, WHAT WAS THE

739
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
MOTIVE, WHAT IS THE MOTIVE?

740
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
WHAT WOULD DRIVE SOMEBODY LIKE

741
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
THIS TO KILL HIS OWN MOTHER?

742
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
AND THEN TO OPEN FIRE ON A

743
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
SCHOOL FILLED WITH INNOCENT

744
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
CHILDREN.

745
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
THE ANSWER, IT'S ALMOST

746
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
IRRELEVANT.
THE FACT THAT IT HAPPENED IS

747
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
WHAT'S SO DEVASTATING TO SO MANY

748
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
PEOPLE.
AND EVEN THE TOWN SAYING, IN THE

749
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
NICEST WAY POSSIBLE, LET US BE,

750
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
LET US HEAL.

751
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I THINK EVERYBODY WANTS TO HEAL.

752
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
IF THAT'S EVEN POSSIBLE,

753
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
SOLEDAD.

754
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
>> YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO QUESTION

755
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
ABOUT THAT.

756
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'LL EVER

757
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
KNOW REALLY WHY.

758
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE HAVE TOLD US --

759
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
THEY MIGHT KNOW THE HOW.

760
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
THEY MIGHT EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO

761
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
UNDERSTAND WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

762
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
LAYING OUT THE -- HOW IT

763
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
HAPPENED.

764
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
BUT THEY MAY NEVER ACTUALLY

765
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
UNDERSTAND THE WHY.

766
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000

THE CHILDREN, MY SON INCLUDED,

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO

777
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
REACT APPROPRIATELY, AND THEY

778
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
BASICALLY RAN RIGHT NEXT TO THE

779
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
GUY, OUT THE DOOR.

780
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
>> THEY RAN PAST THE GUNMAN.

781
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
>> THEY RAN -- HE'S STILL

782
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
STANDING IN THE DOOR.

783
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
AND THEY RAN PAST HIM.

784
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
