ALLOW FREE WILL?

SIMPLE EXPLANATION.

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
WILL AND TURN IT AGAINST THE

PROFOUND AND IN JEWISH

CRIES ALONGSIDE US.

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
FROM OUR RESERVOIR OF FAITH.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000

WE DON'T KNOW, BUT ALSO TO

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000

LOVE WHAT THE RABBI SAID THAT

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
GOD CRIES ALONG WITH US AND

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
WHEN WE SEE THIS HAPPENING

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
OFTEN AS YOU MENTION RICK, WE

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
ASKED THE QUESTION WHY.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
AND THAT ANSWER, THAT QUESTION

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
IS PROFOUND BECAUSE WE SEE IT

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
HAPPENING IN OUR SOCIETY, THAT

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
SEEMS TO BE SO AFFLUENT, SO

168

GOOD, SO HUMAN, SO DEVELOPED.

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
AND I THINK IT GOES BACK ONCE

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
AGAIN TO OUR ABILITY TO CHOOSE

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
TO EITHER LOVE OR TO BE

172
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
SELFISH AND WHEN GOD CREATED

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
US, HE ENTERED INTO A COVENANT

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000

NOT WITH OBJECTS, BUT A BEING

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
AND SPARKED, LOVE IS A

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
PRECIOUS GIFT TO BE USED

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
ABOUT IT, THAT CHILDREN DON'T

373
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
ACTUALLY KNOW, WHEN THEY SEE

374
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
VIDEO, LET'S SAY THAT THE

375
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
STILL PICTURES OF THE CHILDREN

376
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
BEING LED OUT OF THE SCHOOL,

377
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
WHEN THEY SEE THIS OVER AND

378
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
OVER, THEY DON'T HAVE A WAY,

379
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
YOUNG CHILDREN, OF KNOWING

380
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
THAT IT'S A REPEAT OF VIDEO OR

381
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
THIS PHOTOGRAPH.

382
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
THEY THINK IT MAY BE HAPPENING

383
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

384
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
DO YOU FEEL IT'S TRUE?
>> WELL, I THINK YOU COULD

385
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT TO THEM.

386
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
CERTAINLY THEY MAY SEE IT THAT

387
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
WAY, KIDS, ESPECIALLY YOUNG

388
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
CHILDREN ARE NOT GOOD AT

389
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
VERBALLIZING THEIR EMOTIONS

390
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
AND THEY TEND TO ACT OUT.

391
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I THINK AS A PARENT YOU REALLY

392
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
HAVE TO TRY TO HAVE AN OPEN

393
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
LINE OF COMMUNICATION AND

394
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
SPEAK TO THEM ABOUT THIS IN A

395
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
WAY THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND

396
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
AND APPRECIATE.

397
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
>> Jamie: IF WE WANT TO BE

398
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
PROACTIVE WITH OUR CHILDREN

399
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
AND PREPARE THEM THAT THESE

400
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
THINGS DO HAPPEN IN PLACES YOU

401
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
WOULDN'T EXPECT.

402
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
WHAT ADVICE CAN WE GIVE OUR

403
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
CHILDREN ON HOW TO TRY TO

404
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
PROTECT THEMSELVES?

405
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO

406
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
FOCUS ON THE MENTAL HEALTH OF

407
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
OUR KIDS, AND WE NEED TO RELY

408
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
LESS ON METAL DETECTORS AND

409
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
MORE ON MENTAL HEALTH

410
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
DETECTORS AND I THINK THIS

411
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
COULD HAVE BEEN A WAY TO AVOID

412
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
THE TRAGEDY.

413
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I THINK IF WE CAN LEARN

414
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
ANYTHING FROM THE TRAGEDY,

415
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
IT'S THAT WE HAVE TO BE

416
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
PROACTIVE AND WHEN WE SEE

417
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
SOMETHING HAPPENING IN OUR

418
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
CHILDREN, WE HAVE TO NIP IT IN

419
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
THE BUD BEFORE IT BECOMES

420
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
SOMETHING HORRIFIC, SUCH AS

421
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
THIS EVENT.

422
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
>> WE CAN HOPE SO, CORRECT ME

423
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
IF YOU'LL WRONG, BUT THE FACT

424
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
THAT THE SUSPECT MAY HAVE BEEN

425
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
ON THE ASPERGER'S SPECTRUM.

426
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I DON'T WANT TO JUMP TO

427
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
CONCLUSIONS AND I DON'T WANT

428
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
TO USE IT AS AN EXCUSE FOR BAD

429
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
AND HORRIFIC BEHAVIOR.

430
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
MANY PEOPLE WHO MAY BE LONERS

431
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
OR MAY BE ON THE SPECTRUM HAVE

432
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
VERY FULFILLING AND PRODUCTIVE

433
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
LIVES AND NEVER GET INTO

434
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
TROUBLE, CORRECT?

435
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
>> WELL, THAT'S CORRECT.

436
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
ASPERGER'S DISORDER IS

437
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
CHARACTERIZED BY PARTIALLY A

438
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
LACK OF EMPATHY FOR OTHERS AND

439
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
THAT MAY HAVE PLAYED A ROLE,

440
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
BUT THERE ARE VERY HIGH

441
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
FUNCTIONING ASPERGER'S PEOPLE

442
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
THAT LEAD VERY PRODUCTIVE

443
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
LIVES, AS YOU'VE SAID, AND

444
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
IT'S ON THE AUTISTIC SPECTRUM

445
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
SO A LOT OF TIMES THESE PEOPLE

446
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
HAVE DIFFICULTY RELATING TO

447
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
OTHER PEOPLE AND FEELING

448
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
EMPATHY, BUT CERTAINLY IT

449
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
CAN'T BE GENERALIZED TO ALL

450
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
PEOPLE WITH ASPERGER'S

451
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
DISORDERS.
>> Jamie: QUICKLY BEFORE WE

452
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
GO, WILL THIS COMMUNITY

453
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
RECOVER?

454
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
>> I THINK IT WILL.
I'VE SEEN AN ENORMOUS

455
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT FROM THE

456
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
COUNTRY AND I ACTUALLY KNOW

457
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
THIS TOWN PERSONALLY FROM MY

458
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
OWN PAST.

459
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I THINK IT'S A TIGHT KNIT

460
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
COMMUNITY AND SUPPORT EACH

461
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
OTHER AND IN THE END EVERYONE

462
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
IS GOING TO BE FINE, BUT
ULTIMATELY THE HEALING WILL

463
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
TAKE A WHILE.

464
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
>> Jamie: ABSOLUTELY.

465
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
WE HOPE FOR THAT.

466
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

467

468

>> Jamie: RICK.

469
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
>> Rick: SCENES OF HORROR.

WHO IS ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM.

522

AS YOU HEAR THE REPORTS ABOUT

523
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
POSSIBLE ASPERGER'S, WHAT ARE

524
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
YOUR THOUGHTS?

525
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
>> LISTEN, THE AUTISM SPECTRUM

526
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
IS A VERY COMPLEX GROUP OF

527
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
DIFFERENT AILMENTS, BUT IN NO

528
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
WAY DOES IT HAVE AN EVIL

529
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
COMPONENT TO IT.

530
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
MOST CHILDREN WITH AUTISM HAVE

531
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
SWEET, LOVING CHILDREN AND

532
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
ASPERGER'S IN PARTICULAR, YOU

533
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
HAVE HIGH FUNCTIONING

534
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
INDIVIDUALS, VERY PRODUCTIVE.

535
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
YES, THEY HAVE STRUGGLES WITH

536
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
SOCIALIZING, WITH

537
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
COMMUNICATING, THEY'RE

538
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
NORMALLY INTELLIGENT AND IN

539
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
MANY OF TIMES EVEN THE

540
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
DIAGNOSIS IS THEY'RE FOR THE

541
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
COMMUNITY.

542
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO SEPARATE

543
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
TWO THINGS HERE WE HAVE AIDS

544
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
IN THE AUTISM SPECTRUM.

545
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
IF THEY'RE NOT TAKEN CARE OF,

546
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
IF THEY'RE IN THE IN A LOVING

547
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
ATMOSPHERE, SOMETIMES THEY'RE

548
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
EXPOSED TO UGLINESS AND COPE

549
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
WITH IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY,

550
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
BUT SOMETIMES WITH AUTISM

551
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
BECAUSE THEY'RE A LITTLE

552
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
BEHIND IN THE COMMUNICATION

553
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
SKILLS, THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO

554
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
TALK ABOUT THE UGLINESS, TO

555
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
ME, IT'S MORE THE ENVIRONMENT,

556
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
IT'S, YOU KNOW, HOW THEY WERE

557
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
RAISED, HOW THEY WERE LOVED,

558
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
WHY YOU KNOW, WHAT, WHAT, YOU

559
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
KNOW WHAT PEOPLE DID FOR THEM,

560
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
HOW THEY DEAL WITH OTHERS

561
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
MAKES THE DIFFERENCE JUST LIKE

562
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
ANY OTHER CHILD COULD BE

563
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
EXPOSE TODAY UGLINESS.

564
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
AND MY HEART, YESTERDAY WHEN

565
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
THIS WHOLE THING HAPPENED, I

566
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
HAD TO GO PICK UP MY SON AT

567
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
HIS SCHOOL, YOU KNOW, HE'S MY

568
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
AUTISTIC SON AND HE HAD

569
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
ALREADY HEARD IT,S' 15 YEARS

570
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
OLD AND WE CAME HOME AND WE

571
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
TALKED ABOUT IT AND FOR HIM, I

572
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
HAD TO EXPLAIN IT IN A

573
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
DIFFERENT KIND OF LIGHT.

574
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
>> Rick: RIGHT.
>> BUT YOU COULD SEE THAT HE

575
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
DOES UNDERSTAND, JUST LIKE ANY

576
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
CHILD IN THE SPECTRUM.

577
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
THEY UNDERSTAND GOOD AND EVIL

578
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
AND THEY UNDERSTAND THAT EVIL

579
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
DOES NOT PLAY A ROLE IN

580
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
ANYBODY'S PART.

581
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
SO, YES, I THINK THAT THE

582
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
SPECULATION IS GOING TO MOVE

583
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
FORWARD.

584
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING

585
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
TO TALK ABOUT THIS PAST

586
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
HISTORY OF ASPERGER'S AND

587
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS AN

588
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
OUTCAST IN HIGH SCHOOL OR NOT,

589
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT

590
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
IS HOW, WHAT KIND OF EVILNESS

591
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
OR WHAT KIND OF LACK OF LOVE

592
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
THAT THEY SEE GROWING UP.

593
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
>> Rick: DR. MANNY ALVAREZ A

594
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
PART OF THE NEWS MEDICAL

595
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
A-TEAM.

596
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

597
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

598
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
>> THANK YOU.

599
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
...

600
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
[ Male Announcer ]
IT'S SIMPLE PHYSICS...

601
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
A BODY AT REST
TENDS TO STAY AT REST...

602
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
WHILE A BODY IN MOTION
TENDS TO STAY IN MOTION.

603
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
STAYING ACTIVE CAN ACTUALLY
EASE ARTHRITIS SYMPTO.

604
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
BUT IF YOU HAVE ARTHRITIS,

605
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
STAYING ACTIVE
CAN BE DIFFICULT.

606
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
PRESCRIPTION CELEBREX
CAN HELP RELIEVE ARTHRITIS PAIN

607
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
SO YOUR BODY
CAN STAY IN MOTION.

608
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
BECAUSE JUST ONE
200MG CELEBREX A DAY

609
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
CAN PROVIDE 24 HOUR RELIEF

610
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
FOR MANY WITH ARTHRITIS PAIN
AND INFLAMMATION.

611
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
PLUS, IN CLINICAL STUDIES,

612
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
CELEBREX IS PROVEN TO IMPROVE
DAILY PHYSICAL FUNCTION

613
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
SO MOVING IS EASIER.

614
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
CELEBREX CAN BE TAKEN WITH
OR WITHOUT FOOD.

615
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
AND IT'S NOT A NARCOTIC.

616
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR
SHOULD BALANCE THE BENETS

617
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
WITH THEISKS.

618
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
ALL PRESCRIPTION NSAIDS,
LIKE CELEBREX, IBUPROFEN,

619
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
NAPROXEN, AND MELOXICAM

620
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
HAVE THE SAME
CARDIOVASCULAR WARNING.

621
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
THEY ALL MAY INCREASE
THE CHANCE

622
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
OF HEART ATTACK OR STROKE,
WHICH CAN LEAD TO DEATH.

623
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
THIS CHANCE INCREASES
IF YOU HAVE HEART DISEASE
