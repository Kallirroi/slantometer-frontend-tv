NOT BY THE SHOOTER.

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
DID HE LEAVE ANY NOTES BEHIND?

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
DID HE TELL ANYONE WHAT HE WAS

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
PLANNING TO DO?
AMONG THE MANY QUESTIONS WE ALL

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
HAVE TONIGHT.

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000

I WANT TO GO TO ASHLEY BANFIELD.

ASHLEY, I WAS WATCHING EARLIER

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
WHEN YOU WERE SNEAKING AND I

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THINK -- WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
THEM, THE FACT THAT THEY WERE

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
OKAY.
BUT THIS IS EVERY APARTMENT'S

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
NIGHTMARE BODIES OF THE CHILDREN

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
ARE LYING THERE AND POLICE STILL

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
CALL IT A CRIME SCENE AND THE

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
PARENTS CAN'T EVEN SEE THEM.

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
THAT'S A BLOODY MATCH OFF.

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
>> NO OTHER WAY TO PUT IT.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
UNIMAGINABLE HORROR.

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
AND I HAVE ANOTHER DETAIL I WANT

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
TO SHARE WITH YOU ABOUT HOW SOME

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
OF THESE PARENTS LEARNED THAT

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
THEY WOULDN'T BE SEEING THEIR

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
CHILDREN AGAIN.
I THINK YOU KNOW THE DETAIL THAT

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
MANY OF THE CHIRP WERE RUSHED

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
OUT OF THE SCHOOL, OUT OF THE

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
SANDY HOPE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BY

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
THE POLICE AND TEACHERS AND THEY

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
RACED ON FOOT TO A NEAR BIFD

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
FIRE STATION THROUGHOUT THE DAY

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THERE WAS AN AREA WITHIN THE
FIRE STATION WHERE THE CHILDREN

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
WERE KEPT AND THEY WERE SHOWN

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
MOVIES UNTIL THEIR PARENTS CAME

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
TO FIND THEM.

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
>> BUT PARENTS WERE MILLING AWAY

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WHEN STUDENTS -- IT WAS QUITE A

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
CHAOTIC SCENE.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY,

137
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
PARENTS ARRIVE AND CHIRPEN WERE

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
TAKEN A WAY.

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
ULTIMATELY THIS WAS A MOMENT

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
WHERE THEY HAD TO TELL THESE

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
WAITING PARENTS THERE WILL BE NO

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
MONTH REUNIONED TONIGHT TONIGHT.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'VE TOLD FROM SOMEONE IN THAT

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
AREA BUT AT THE MOMENT THE

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
PARENTS WERE TOLD NO MORE

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
REUNIONS AND NO MORE CHILDREN

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
COMING.
AND THEN THERE WERE WHALES.

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
AND JUST A HORRIFYING MOMENT

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
BEING THE PARENTS WHO WAITED AND

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
WAITED AND WAITED, ONLY TO HEAR

151
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
THIS.

CHILDREN ARE STILL IN THAT

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
SCHOOL TONIGHT.

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
SCHOOL SYSTEM SAYING THAT THERE

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
DIDN'T SAY THAT IT WAS A SCHOOL

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
BUT THE SCHOOLS WERE ON LOUK

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
DIOP I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000

POLICE.

224
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
SCENES OF COMPLETE CHAOS.

225
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
HOW QUICKLY WAS IT THAT YOU

226
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
REALIZED YOUR DAUGHTER WAS SAFE?

227
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
>> OKAY.

228
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
WHEN I GOT THERE THERE WAS

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
COMPLETE CHAOS BUT I SAW SOME

230
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
MOMS AND A NEIGHBOR.

231
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
AND I ASKED THEM WHAT HAD

232
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
HAPPENED AND THEY SAID THEY

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
DIDN'T KNOW.

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
BUT THAT THERE WAS A SHOOTING

235
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
THEY CARRIED OUT A LITTLE GIRL

236
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
AND IT LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS DEAD

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
SO I STANLTLY I PANICKED BECAUSE

238
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
MY BABY HEERP.

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
BUT THANKFULLY, NO SOONER HE HAD

BEING BROUGHT FROM THE SCHOOL OF

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000

245
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
OKAY, SHE'S COMING.

246
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000

247
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
THE FOR HOUSE.

248
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
>> THIS MUST HAVE BEEN A

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
TERRIFYING DAY FOR YOU.
WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
HAPPENING?
WERE YOU AWARE SOMEBODY WAS

251
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
FIRING A GUN AT THE SCHOOL?

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
IMMEDIATELY AND BROUGHT ALL THE

259
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
KIDS TO A CORNER OF THE ROOM

260
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
WHERE THEY STAYED THERE.

261
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
THEY WERE SCARED.

262
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
THEY WERE SHAKEN BUT THEY DIDN'T

263
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON UNTIL

264
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
LATER WHEN THEY WERE BROUGHT TO

265
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
THE FIRE HOUSE.

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
POLICE CAME AND KNOCKED ON THE

267
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000

HE CAN COME OUT.

268
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000

269
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000

270
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
OVER TO THE FIRE HOUSE AND

271
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
THAT'S WHERE YOU CAUGHT UP WITH

272
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
SOPHIA -- EXTRAORDINARILY

273
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE FOR ALL

274
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
THOSE CHILDREN.

275
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
AND WHO SURVIVES THIS.

276
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
>> I THINK SHE'S NUMB RIGHT NOW.

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
WHOOERP DEVASTATED FOR THE REST

282
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
OF THE FAMILIES BECAUSE WE DON'T

283
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
KNOW.

284
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I DO MY CLOSE FRIENDS, THEIR

285
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
CHILDREN ARE OKAY.

286
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
BUT WE DON'T KNOW.

287
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000

288
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000

00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
>> I THINK SHE'S TOO COLD.

291
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
>> NO, I THINK SHE SHOULD

292
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
PROBABLY GO HOME WITH HER MOM.

293
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
IT'S BEEN A TERRIFYING WEEK.

294
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000

>> THIS IS A CLOSE-KNIT SCHOOL

297
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
AND THIS IS DEVASTATING.

298
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'LL BE HERE FOR ANYBODY.

299
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000

ALEX, THANK FOR JOINING ME.

309
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
YOU, IN CHARACTER, IS THERE

310
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
SOMETHING YOU COULD HAVE EVER

311
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
PREDICTED THAT HE WOULD ONE DAY

312
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
FLIP AND DO SOMETHING AS

313
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
MONSTROUS AS THIS.
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN EVER

314
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
PREDICT SOMETHING LIKE THAT

315
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
WOULD HAPPEN BUT I DON'T KNOW IF

316
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I COULD PREDICT IT.

317
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
THERE WAS SOMETHING OFF ABOUT

318
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
HIM.
I ONLY KNEW HIM CLOSELY WHEN WE

319
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
WERE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

320
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
TOGETHER.
HE WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT

321
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
DIFFERENT.
HE MOSTLY STAYED TO HIMSELF BUT

322
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD HAVE

323
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
PREDICTED THIS.
>> HE WAS, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, A

324
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
PRETTY CLIFR I THINK PLAN?

325
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
A MATH GENIUS, APPARENTLY?

326
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
>> YEAH.
>> TELL ME ABOUT THAT SIDE OF

327
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
IT.
>> I WAS NEVER IN ANY OF HIS

328
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
CLASSES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

329
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
YOU COULD DEFINITELY SAY HE WAS

330
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
A GENIUS.

331
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
DEFINITELY SOMETHING THERE THAT

332
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
WAS A LITTLE BIT ABOVE THE REST

333
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
OF US.
>> DID HE HAVE FRIENDS?

334
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
WAS HE SOCIAL?

335
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
>> I ALWAYS SAW HIM ALONE.

336
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
BUT I'M SURE -- I THINK HE WHAT

337
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
A FEW, MAYBE, CLOSE FRIENDS,

338
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
THROUGH SCHOOL OR HIS CLASSES.

339
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
BUT MOST OF THE TIME I SAW HIM

340
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
HE WAS ALONE, YEAH.

341
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
>> HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE HIS

342
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
PERSONALITY.

343
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
>> HE WAS REALLY QUIET AND KEPT

344
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
TO HIMSELF AND AP LITTLE IF I

345
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
JETTY AND A LITTLE UNEASY IF YOU

346
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
WERE TO LOOK AT HIM.

347
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
SOCIALLY NOT REALLY INTO GOING

348
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
OUT THERE AND MAKINGS MANY

349
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
FRIENDS AS EVERYONE WAS DOING IT

350
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND

351
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
O'MIDDLE SCHOOL.

352
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
>> DID YOU KNOW HIS FAMILY, HIS

353
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
MOTHER IN PARTICULAR?

354
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
>> I KNEW HER, WE LIVED IN THE

355
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.

356
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I KNEW HER THROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD

357
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
EVENTS.

358
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
MY MOM KNEW HER.

359
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
SHE WAS A NICE WOMAN, A

360
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER.

361
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I DIDN'T KNOW -- I KNOW HER

362
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
PERSONALLY.
>> -- I'VE KNOWN HIM SINCE I WAS

363
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
IN FIRST GRADE AND HE'S ALWAYS

364
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
BEEN THE WAY THAT I'VE DESCRIBED

365
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
HIM.
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN RESERVED BY IT

366
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE DIVORCE

367
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
HAD IN ADDITION TO DO WITH THAT

368
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
AND I DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY

369
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
DIVORCED AND THAT COULD HAVE

370
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
CAUSED THAT AND MADE IT UNTIL I

371
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
WAS OLDER.

372
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
>> WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU THEIR

373
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
ABOUT THIS.

374
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
>>

375
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
>> I'M IN LONDON NOW STUDYING

376
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
HAIR FOR THIS SEMESTER AND I'LL

377
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
BE HOME ON THURSDAY, TO THIS.

378
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I FOUND OUT FIRST, W IT WASN'T

379
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
AN OPTION AND I DIDN'T YOU HAVE

380
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
TO -- A TOWN YOU'VE GROWN UP IN,

381
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
MY WHO E WHOLE LIFE, I WAS

382
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
RAISED IN THAT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

383
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
AND RACED IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM

384
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
THERE AND FINDING OUT IT WAS

385
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
SOMEONE I KNEW ULTIMATELY WHO

386
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
HAD DONE ALL THIS IS JUST.

387
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
>>> AND AROUND UTAH, HOW WOULD

388
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
YOU DESCRIBE THAT?

389
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
>> A VERY KIND OF QUIET PLACE?

390
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
IT IT SFLUS NEVER HAPPENED?

391
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
>> RIGHT.

392
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
>> NO.

393
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
IT'S PRETTY BIG TOWN SPACE WISE.

394
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
WE SPAN OVER A VAST ARRAY OF

395
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
LAND.

396
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
EVERYONE REALLY CAME TOGETHER, I

397
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
THINK, THROUGH THIS AND ISRAEL

398
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
SUPPORTING EACH OTHER QUITE WELL

399
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
AND THAT'S THE ONE GOOD THING TO

400
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
COME OUT OF IT IF NOT ALL 123450

401
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
MIDDLE SCHOOL.

402
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY.

403
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
>> I NEVER NOTICED ANYTHING

404
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
SCARY OR VIOLENT OR ANYTHING

405
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
LIKE THAT.
I WOULD NEVER HAVE EXPECTED THAT

406
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
FROM HIM, I DON'T THINK.

407
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
JUST FROM SOMEONE WHO WENT UNDER

408
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
THE RADAR AND KEPT TO THEMSELVES

409
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
YOU WOULDN'T THINK OF THEM AS

410
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
DOING SOMETHING CRAZY LIKE THIS.

411
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
>> IT HAS TO BE A HELL OF A

412
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
SHOT.
I'M GLAD YOU JOINED US TO GIVE

413
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
US SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THE

414
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
CHARACTER OF THIS PERSON.

415
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
THANK YOU.

416
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
>> THANK YOU.

417
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
>>> OUR NEXT IS PSYCHOLOGY

418
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
OFFICE SHOOTER ADAM TO TALK

419
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
ABOUT THE GUNMAN.

420
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
COULD ONLY COM.

421
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
NEW NECTRESSE.

NEW NECTRESSE.

425
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
SWEETNESS NATURALLY.

426
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
NEW NECTRESSE.
BOPRODUCTIVITY UP, COSTS DOWN,
THTIME TO MARKET REDUCED...

427
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
THOSE ARE GOOD THINGS.

428
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
UPSTAIRS, THEY WILL SEE FANTASY.

429
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
NOT FANTASY... LOGISTICS.

430
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
UPS CAME IN, ANALYZED OUR SUPPLY
CHAIN, INVENTORY SYSTEMS...

431
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
UPS?

432
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
UPS.

433
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
NOT FANTASY?

434
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?

435
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I DID.

436
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
WE DID, BOB. WE DID.

437
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
GOT IT.

438
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I GET CONGESTED.

439
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
BUT NOW, WITH ZYRTEC-D®,

440
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I HAVE THE PROVEN ALLERGY RELIEF

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
IF I MAY START WITH YOU, BRENDA.

446
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
LET'S START WITH YOU IF I MAY.

447
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN MANY OF

448
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
THESE KINDS OF INCIDENTS AND
POSSIBLY NOTHING AS APPALLING AS

449
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
THIS.

450
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
THERE SEEMS TO BE A PATTERN WITH

451
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
AURORA AND THE SHOPPING MALL

452
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
SHOOTING LAST WEEK.

453
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
YOUNG MEN IN THEIR EARLY 20s

454
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
SUDDENLY FLIPPING AND GETTING

455
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
AHOLD OF WEAPONS AND CAUSING

456
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
OUTRAGES.

457
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
WHAT IS DRIVING THEM?

458
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
WHAT IS THE POSSIBLE BACKGROUND

459
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
TO WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

460
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
>> WORKING ON A LOT OF THESE

461
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
CASES THERE A NUMBER OF

462
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
DIFFERENT CAUSES THAT CAN BE
DIVIDED INTO TWO BROAD

463
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
CATEGORIES.

464
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
ONE CATEGORY IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE

465
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
THAT TRAIT OF A LOSS OF EMPATHY

466
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
AND INABILITY TO CONNECT TO

467
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
OTHER PEOPLE AND A HISTORY OF

468
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
CRUELTY OR WHAT PEOPLE TALK

469
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
ABOUT AS SOCIOPATHS OR

470
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY.

471
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
AT THE OTHER END PEOPLE WITH

472
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
BRAIN DISORDERS AND SERIOUS

473
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
MENTAL ILLNESSES THAT ARE

474
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
UNTREATED OR BECAUSE OF WHAT'S

475
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
HAPPENING IN THEIR LIFE,
EXACERBATED BY STRESS.

476
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE LITTLE BIT

477
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
THAT IS COMING OUT, WE ARE MORE

478
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
IN A DIRECTION THAT THIS IS

479
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
SOMEONE WITH A BRAIN DISORDER

480
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STORY

481
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
THAT IT MAY TAKE YEARS TO

482
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
UNCOVER IT.

483
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
THERE IS NOTHING SUDDEN ABOUT

484
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
ANY OF THESE STORIES.

485
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
THAT'S THE HEADLINE FOR ME.

486
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
IT'S SUDDEN FOR US THAT THIS

487
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
HAPPENED.

488
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
AS YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE

489
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
STORY, I ASSURE YOU THE WARNING
SIGNS WERE THERE.

490
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
NOT THAT THEY WERE IGNORED, BUT

491
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
THEY WERE NOT RECOGNIZED.

492
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
>> ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS AS

493
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
LIKELY TO CARRY OUT WHAT THEY

494
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
END UP DOING IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE

495
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
EASY ACCESS TO FIREARMS?

496
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
>> LOOK, THERE IS NO QUESTION

497
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
THAT FIREARMS PLAY A ROLE.

498
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE

499
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO KILL A

500
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
NUMBER OF PEOPLE, THERE OTHER

501
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
WEAPONS OF DESTRUCTION AND WAYS

502
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
TO MAKE BOMBS AND AT LEAST ONE

503
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
CASE I WORKED ON.

504
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
FIREARMS ARE CERTAINLY AN

505
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
IMPORTANT PART OF THE PICTURE,

506
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
BUT UNDERSTANDING WHEN SOMEBODY

507
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
HAS A MENTAL ILLNESS IF IT
PLAYED A AND I DON'T KNOW THAT

508
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
IT HAS, BUT IT NEEDS TO BE

509
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BEFORE

510
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
ALLOWING THAT PERSON TO HAVE A
FIREARM.

511
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
>> FRANK, YOU SPECIALIZE IN

512
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
TREATING POST TRAUMATIC STRESS

513
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
AND THE EFFECTS OF VIOLENCE.

514
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
A VERY PARTICULAR PROBLEM HERE

515
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
WITH SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE

516
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
SCHOOL WHO HAVE LUCKILY

517
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
SURVIVED.
HAVING TO DEAL NOW WITH THE

518
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
HORROR OF LOSING POSSIBLE

519
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
FRIENDS AND PEOPLE THAT THEY

520
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
KNEW FROM THE SCHOOL AND

521
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
TEACHERS AND THE HEAD TEACHER

522
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
AND SO ON.

523
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
WHERE DO YOU START WITH TRYING

524
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
TO COUNSEL YOUNG CHILDREN WHEN

525
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
THIS KIND OF APPALLING THING
HAPPENS?

526
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
>> I THINK THE FIRST THING IS

527
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
HELPING THE PARENTS.

528
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
THE CHILDREN LOOK TO THEIR

529
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
PARENTS AND FOR THE PARENTS,

530
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
SOME OF THEM ARE STUNNED.

531
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
THEY ARE GRIEVING.

532
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
THEY LOST A PRECIOUS 6-YEAR-OLD.

533
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
FOR THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES,

534
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
SOMETIMES CHILDREN WHO GO

535
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
THROUGH THIS AND DO SURVIVE TAKE

536
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
A WHILE TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF IT.

537
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
THEY MAY REGRESS AND MOVE

538
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
BACKWARDS A YEAR OR TWO IN TERMS

539
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
OF THEIR NORMAL DEVELOPMENT.

540
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
SOME OF THEM WILL FIGURE OUT

541
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
YEARS LATER WHAT ACTUALLY

542
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
HAPPENED.

543
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
SOME ARE GOING TO DO RELATIVELY

544
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
WELL.

545
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
THEY WILL BE SADDER AND WISER IN

546
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
A WAY.

547
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WHAT

548
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I SEE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
THAT COMMUNITY IS COMING

549
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
TOGETHER.

550
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
PEOPLE ARE LOVING EACH OTHER.

551
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS COME TO REMIND

552
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
US THAT WE ARE A NATION WHO

553
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
CARES AND HE CAME AS A FATHER.

554
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I AM A FATHER AND A GRANDFATHER.

555
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I HAVE CALLED MY CHILDREN AND I

556
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY ARE DOING

557
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

558
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
AS WE COME TOGETHER, WE DO THE
BEST THAT WE CAN AT A SAD TIME

559
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
LIKE THIS.

560
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
>> I SUPPOSE THE BIG QUESTION IS

561
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
WHY WOULD THIS SHOOTER DO WHAT
HE DID?

562
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
GO TO A CLASSROOM AND MURDER SO

563
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
MANY YOUNG CHILDREN OF SUCH A

564
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
YOUNG TENDER AGE, POSSIBLY THE

565
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
CLASSROOM THAT HIS MOTHER WAS

566
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
ALREADY KILLED AT THEIR HOME.

567
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
CAN YOU TRY TO PIECE FROM YOUR

568
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
EXPERIENCE THE THOUGHT PROCESS

569
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
HERE?

570
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
WHY HE WOULD THEN HAVING KILLED

571
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
HIS MOTHER GO TO THE SCHOOL AND

572
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
DO WHAT HE DID?

573
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
>> I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL

574
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
AND I HAVEN'T DIAGNOSED OR

575
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
ASSESSED HIM.

576
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ARE

577
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
NOT MORE VIOLENT.

578
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.
SIMPLY NOT THE DATA WE HAVE.

579
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
IF INDEED MENTAL ILLNESS IS A

580
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
PART OF THIS, THERE IS A

581
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
PARTICULAR PATH THAT NEEDS TO BE

582
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
LOOKED AT.

583
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
ARE THEY DEPRESSED AND

584
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
SUICIDALLY DEPRESSED.

585
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
HIS ROOMMATE ALEX ISRAEL SAID HE

586
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
PREFERRED TO STAY ALONE.

587
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
A SYMPTOM OF ASPERGER'S AND

588
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
REPORT THAT CAME OUT WHICH MAY

589
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
OR MAY NOT BE TRUE, THERE IS A

590
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
CAPACITY FOR EMPATHY AND SOCIAL

591
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
CONNECTION THAT LEAVES THE

592
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
PERSON SUFFERING FOR THIS

593
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
CONDITION.

594
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
THEY ARE PRONE TO SERIOUS

595
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY.

596
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
IF THEY ARE SUICIDALLY

597
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
DEPRESSED, WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH.

598
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO IN

599
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
AGREEING TO COME HERE IS TO ASK

600
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
PEOPLE TO DON'T RUSH TO JUDGMENT

601
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
ABOUT WHO THIS YOUNG MAN IS.

602
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
IF IT WAS MENTAL ILLNESS THAT

603
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
PLAYED A ROLE, IT'S AN

604
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO BETTER.

605
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
>> THERE IS A SCHOOL THAT YOU

606
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
SHOULDN'T GIVE HIM ATTENTION AND

607
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
NAME HIM AND SO ON BECAUSE IT

608
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
BRINGS ATTENTION TO HIM.

609
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
HE'S DEAD SO HE WON'T BE ABLE TO

610
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
BASK IN THE APPALLING GLORY OF

611
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
WHAT HE DID, BUT SECONDLY THESE

612
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
YOUNG MEN.
>> YOU ARE MAKING THAT

613
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
ASSUMPTION.

614
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

615
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I SPEND MANY HOURS WITH MEN LIKE

616
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
THIS WHO KILLED DOZENS OF

617
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
PEOPLE.

618
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY WANT

619
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
GLORY.

620
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
THEY ARE SERIOUSLY ILL.

621
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
OTHERS WHO DO WANT GLORY.

622
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
YOU ARE RUSHING TO A PARTICULAR

623
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
INTERPRETATION OF THIS.

624
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
IT'S WAY TOO SOON TO KNOW.

625
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
>> SORRY.

626
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
>> I WOULD LIKE TO ENDORSE THAT

627
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
ALSO.

628
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I KNOW FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY, WE

629
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHY THIS

630
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
HAPPENED.

631
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
WHEN YOU ARE A PARENT YOU CAN'T

632
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
STOP THINKING ABOUT THESE

633
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
QUESTIONS THAT YOU ARE ASKING.

634
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN

635
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
ANSWERING THEM.

636
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
WHEN YOU MENTIONED THAT WE HAD

637
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
SEVERAL SIMILAR CASES RECENTLY,
YES, THESE WERE SIMILAR IN THAT

638
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
GUNS WERE USED AND THEY WERE

639
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
SPREE KILLINGS AND MASS
KILLINGS.

640
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I CAN TELL YOU AS A MEDICAL

641
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
DOCTOR AND PSYCHIATRIST WHO

642
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
WORKED CLOSELY ON CASES, THERE

643
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
WERE DIFFERENT MOTIVES AND

644
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
MENTALITIES.

645
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
THERE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A

646
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
CONSCIOUS.

647
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
THEY TORTURE ANIMALS.

648
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
THEY HAVE NO BASIS IN THEIR MIND

649
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
FOR EMPATHY OR SYMPATHY.

650
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
THEY LEARN HOW TO FAKE IT.

651
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
ONE OF THE COLUMBINE KILLERS FIT

652
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
THAT PATTERN, BUT THE OTHER WAS

653
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
DIFFERENT.

654
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
HE WAS NOT A PSYCHOPATH.

655
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
IN THE CASE OF THE AURORA

656
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
SHOOTER, THE JURY IS NOT IN YET,

657
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
BUT I HAVE A FEELING WE WILL

658
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
FIND HE WAS ON THE VERGE OF

659
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
MAJOR MENTAL ILLNESS ABOUT

660
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
DELUSIONS AND HALLUCINATIONS.

661
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
ONE TIME IN MY LIFE I WAS

662
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL

663
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
PROGRAM OF MENTAL HEALTH

664
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
SERVICES IN AMERICA.
I HAVE TO ADMIT WE FAILED.

665
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
WE FAILED AMERICA IN PROTECTING
THE LIVES OF THE SERIOUSLY

666
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
MENTALLY ILL.

667
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
MOST OF WHAT THEY DO IS SUFFER

668
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
IN SILENCE.

669
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
THEIR FAMILIES WANT TO DO BETTER

670
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
BY THEM AND AS A COUNTRY WE HAVE

671
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
NOT STEPPED UP AND BEEN

672
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
SYMPATHETIC AND CARING AND

673
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
APPROPRIATE FOR THE SERIOUSLY

674
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
MENTALLY ILL.

675
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
>> AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT POINT.

676
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY IS YOU

677
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
BOTH HAVE MADE EXTREMELY VALID

678
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
POINTS.

679
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
YOU HAVE THREE SUCCESSIVE

680
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
APPALLING MASS SHOOTINGS

681
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
INVOLVING YOUNG MEN IN THEIR 20s

682
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
WHERE THE BACKGROUND TO ALL OF

683
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
THEM WAS NOT DISSIMILAR.

684
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THEY SEEM TO BE FAIRLY NORMAL

685
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
KIND OF SLIGHTLY OFF, BUT

686
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
NOTHING WITH ALARM BELLS.

687
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
THE POINT OF EXAMINING THEIR

688
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
CHARACTER IS THAT THERE MUST BE

689
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
A GOOD LIKELIHOOD THAT THERE

690
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
OTHERS LIKE THAT OUT THERE WHO
MAY BE CONSIDERING SIMILAR

691
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
ATROCITIES.
HOW DO PEOPLE WHO KNOW THESE

692
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
TYPES OF PEOPLE SPOT ANY WARNING

693
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
SIGNS?

694
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
>> PIERS --

695
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
>> LET ME START WITH THE DOCTOR.

696
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
>> I'M SORRY.
I HAVE THREE SMALL CHILDREN.

697
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
BEFORE THIS INTERVIEW THEY ASKED

698
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
ME WHAT I WAS DOING AND WE
TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR ABOUT AN

699
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
HOUR AND A HALF.

700
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
MY 9-YEAR-OLD GOT FRIGHTENED, HE

701
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
GOES TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

702
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THESE

703
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
THINGS ARE EXCEEDINGLY RARE.

704
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
LET'S NOT FORGET, THIS IS

705
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
EXCEEDINGLY RARE.

706
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING HAPPENED

707
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
IN THE LAST MONTH DOESN'T

708
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
STATISTICALLY MAKE IT A COMMON
OCCURRENCE.

709
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
LET'S BE CLEAR AND TELL OUR

710
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
CHILDREN THAT.

711
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TURN

712
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
TRAGEDY INTO AN OPPORTUNITY TO

713
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
FIX SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE

714
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
TERRIBLY BROKEN IN OUR MENTAL

715
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND KNOW HOW

716
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE AT RISK FOR

717
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
VIOLENCE.
IT'S ALL AT THE LEVEL OF STATE

718
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
FUNDING.

719
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
SORRY ABOUT GET GET INTO THE

720
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
SPECIFICS, BUT IT'S MENTAL

721
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
HEALTH CARE AND SCREENING OF NOT

722
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
ONLY YOUNG ADULTS AND CHILDREN

723
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
WHO OFFER A GOOD ASSESSMENT, WE

724
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
CAN IN FACT DO A MUCH BETTER JOB
OF NOT ONLY CARING FOR THE

725
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
PEOPLE AND IDENTIFY THOSE WHO

726
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
WOULD NEVER BE VIOLENT IF NOT

727
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
FOR A MENTAL ILLNESS.

728
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
THAT IS ONE BIT OF THE STORY.

729
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
THERE IS ANOTHER PART WHICH IS
WHAT I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE

730
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH AND

731
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
INTERESTED IN BECAUSE OF MOVIES.

732
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
THE DIABOLICAL SOCIOPATH.

733
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
BOTH STORIES ARE TRUE, BUT BOTH
ARE ACTUALLY QUITE RARE.

734
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
>> THE FINAL WORD, MAKE IT BRIEF

735
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
IF YOU MAY.

736
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
>> AMERICA HAS MORE GUN DEATHS

737
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
THAN ANY OTHER ADVANCED NATION

738
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
IN THE WORLD.

739
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
WE HAVE LAWS THAT SAY IF YOU ARE

740
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL, YOU
SHOULDN'T POSSESS A WEAPON AND

741
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
WE DON'T ENFORCE THE LAWS.

742
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
WE HAVE TO GET TOGETHER ACROSS

743
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
THIS DIVIDE AND NEED THE NRA TO

744
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
STEP UP AND SAY THEY BELIEVE IN

745
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
GUN SAFETY AND NOT JUST IN GUN

746
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
OWNERSHIP.

747
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
WE NEED POLITICIANS ON BOTH

748
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
SIDES OF THE AISLE TO TACKLE
THIS PROBLEM.

749
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
WE WILL HAVE MORE DEAD AMERICAN

750
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
CHILDREN.
>> THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH.

751
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
STILL AHEAD, WE WILL TALK TO

752
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
SURVIVORS OF ANOTHER SHOOTING,

753
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
BUT NEXT THE PUSH FOR MORE GUN

754
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
CONTROL AFTER THE TRAGEDY.

755
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
BUT NOW, WITH ZYRTEC-D®,

756
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000

760
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
>>> THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE OUR

762
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
NEIGHBORHOODS.

763
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
THESE CHILDREN ARE OUR CHILDREN.

764
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COMING

765
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
TO AND TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION TO

766
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS

767
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
REGARDLESS OF THE TOLL PICKS.

768
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ON THE

769
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
SHOOTING.

770
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
THE MASSACRE IS RAISING NEW

771
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ACCESS OF
GUNS IN AMERICA.

772
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
HE IS URGENTLY CALLING FOR MORE

773
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
GUN CONTROL.

774
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
A FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST ON THE

775
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
SENTENCING COMMISSION ON MORE

776
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
GUNS, LESS CRIME.

777
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
THE PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPAIGN TO

778
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE.

779
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
THE ATTORNEY FOR THE MICHIGAN
AND RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS.

780
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
LET'S START WITH YOU.

781
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
YOU WERE PRETTY OUTSPOKEN SAYING

782
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
THIS IS TIME TO BRING IN NEW GUN

783
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
CONTROL LAWS.

784
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
>> YES.

785
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
IF THIS DOESN'T WAKE US UP, I

786
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL.

787
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I WAS HEARTENED THAT THE

788
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
PRESIDENT SAID WE HAD TO TAKE

789
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
MEANINGFUL ACTION AND THE ONLY

790
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
THING HE CAN DO IS LEAD A

791
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
CRUSADE FOR REASONABLE GUN

792
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
CONTROL LEGISLATION IN CONGRESS.

793
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
THESE MASSACRES ARE TAKING PLACE

794
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
MORE AND MORE OFTEN.

795
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
WE SAW BAY THE WAY TODAY A

796
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
SIMILAR INCIDENT IN CHINA WHERE
A MAD MAN ATTACKED AN ELEMENTARY

797
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
SCHOOL IN CHINA WITH A KNIFE

798
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
WITH 22 INJURED CHILDREN.
NOT DEAD.

799
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

800
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
IN THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE

801
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
9,000 PEOPLE KILLED WITH GUNS

802
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
LAST YEAR IN SIMILAR COUNTRIES

803
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
LIKE GERMANY, 170 AND CANADA

804
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
150.

805
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
THERE IS A REASON FOR THAT.

806
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
>> WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IN

807
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
TERMS OF SPECIFIC GUN CONTROL?

808
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
>> THERE A NUMBER OF PIECES OF

809
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
LEGISLATION WE HAVE BEEN

810
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
PUSHING.

811
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
NO REASONABLE GUN OWNER WHO IS A

812
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
SPORTSMAN CAN OBJECT TO BANS ON

813
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS MADE ONLY TO

814
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
KILL AS MANY HUMAN BEINGS AS

815
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
POSSIBLE LIKE IN A MILITARY

816
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
SITUATION.

817
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
NO ONE CAN OBJECT TO A BAN ON

818
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
THE SALE OF LARGE AMMUNITION

819
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
CLIPS SO YOU CAN'T RELOAD.

820
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
NO ONE CAN OBJECT TO

821
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
MICROSTAMPING OF CARD RIDGES TO

822
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
TRACE THE MURDER WEAPON.

823
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
NO ONE CAN OBJECT TO ELIMINATING

824
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
THE GUNSHOT EXCEPTION SO EVEN IF

825
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
YOU BUY A GUN AT A GUN SHOW,

826
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
THEY STILL HAVE TO CHECK YOUR

827
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
BACKGROUND TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE

828
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
NOT SELLING TO SOMEONE ON A

829
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
TERRORIST WATCH LIST OR MENTALLY

830
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
UNSTABLE PERSON OR A FELON.

831
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
THOSE ARES WE SHOULD DO.

832
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
>> WE HAD A HEATED DEBATE ON A

833
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
PREVIOUS INCIDENT.

834
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
TWO THINGS HAPPENED IN 1996.

835
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
ATHERE WAS A MASSACRE IN

836
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
TASMANIA IN WHICH 35 PEOPLE WERE

837
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
KILLED.

838
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
THE AUSTRALIANS WAS RIGHT WING
AND FRIENDS OF GEORGE W. BUSH

839
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
AND BROUGHT IN DRACONIAN LAWS

840
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
AFTER THAT.
HE BROUGHT IN RIFLES AND

841
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
SHOTGUNS.

842
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
AS A RESULT OF THE NEXT DECADE,

843
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
FIREARM HOMICIDE RATE FELL BY

844
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
59% AND SUICIDE RATE FELL BY

845
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
65%.

846
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
>> NOT TRUE.

847
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
>> IT IS TRUE.
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

848
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
IF YOU LOOK OVERTIME --

849
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
>> IT IS TRUE.

850
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
>> I'M TELLING YOU PEOPLE CAN

851
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
LOOK IT UP THEMSELVES.

852
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
WHAT YOU FIND IS FOR DECADES THE

853
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
MURDER RATE WAS FALLING IN

854
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
AUSTRALIA.

855
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
IT BASICALLY STOPPED FALLING.

856
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
IF YOU COMPARE THE AVERAGE O TWO

857
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
DECADES WHERE IT'S FALLING TO

858
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
WHAT IT WAS AFTERWARDS, IT MAKES

859
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
IT LOOK LIKE THE AVERAGE BEFORE

860
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
IS HIGHER THAN AFTERWARDS.

861
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
IF YOU LOOK ON A YEAR BY YEAR

862
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
BASIS, THERE WASN'T THAT FALL.
>> WHY DOES ADAM LANZA MOTHER

863
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
NEED TO HAVE THESE THREE

864
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
WEAPONS?

865
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
ER INCLUDING THE SEMI-AUTOMATIC?

866
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
>> CAN I FOLLOW-THROUGH ON THE

867
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
AUSTRALIAIA THING?

868
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
>> NO, WHY DOES SHE NEED TO HAVE
THESE THREE WEAPONS PERFORMED

869
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
INCLUDING THIS SEMI AUTOMATIC

870
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
BUSH MASTER.
WHY WOULD A WOMAN TEACHER AT A

871
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
KINDERGARTEN NEED THESE WOMEN

872
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
ONS IN HER HOME?
ALLOWING THEREFORE A CLEARLY

873
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
DERANGED SON TO TAKE THEM AND
COMMIT THIS ATROCITY?

874
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
>> WHATEVER THAT GUN LOOKS LIKE,

875
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
IT'S A SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLE.

876
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
ANY HUNTING RIFLE IS SEMI

877
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
AUTOMATIC.

878
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
DOESN'T MEAN IT FUNCTIONS

879
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
DIFFERENTLY.

880
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
HE FIRED OVER 100 ROUNDS IN

881
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
SEVERAL MINUTES WITH THIS

882
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
APPARENTLY HARMLESS RIFLE.

883
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
>> GUNS MAKE IT EASY.

884
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
>> YOU ARE TRYING TO SAY IT'S AN

885
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
AVERAGE GUN.

886
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
HE FIRED OVER 100 ROUNDS AND
KILLED 20 CHILDREN.

887
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
20 CHILDREN BETWEEN 5 AND 10.

888
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
WHAT POINT DO YOU SAY WE GET IT?

889
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE?

890
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
>> IT IS TIME.

891
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
>> TIME TO DO WHAT?

892
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
>> TO GET RID OF THE GUN LAWS

893
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
THAT CAUSE --
>> TO GET RID OF WHAT?

894
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
>> LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED.

895
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
ALL THE ATTACK THIS IS YEAR

896
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
OCCURRED WHERE GUNS ARE BANNED.

897
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
LOOK AT THE AURORA SHOOTING.

898
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
>> WHAT THE HELL HAS THAT GOT TO

899
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
DO WITH IT?

900
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
SERIOUSLY.
WHAT HAS THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT?

901
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
>> YOU NEVER LETE EXPLAIN.

902
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

903
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
>> IS IT A GUN-FREE ZONE.

904
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
>> LOOK AT THE MOVIE THEATER

905
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
ONE.

906
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
THERE WERE SEVEN MOVIE THEATERS

907
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
SHOWING THE MOVIE WITHIN A 20

908
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
MINUTE DRIVE OF WHERE THE KILLER

909
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
LIVED.

910
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
ONLY ONE OF THOSE BANNED GUNS.

911
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
HE DIDN'T GO TO THE MOVIE

912
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
THEATER CLOSEST TO HIS HOME.

913
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
OR WITH THE LARGEST SCREEN.

914
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
HE WENT TO THE ONE MOVIE THEATER

915
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
THAT BANNED GUNS.

916
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
IF YOU LOOK AT BANS GENERALLY,

917
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
YOU CAN'T POINT TO A PLACE,
CHICAGO, D.C. WHERE WE BAN GUNS

918
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
AND MURDER RATES AND VIOLENT

919
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
CRIMES WENT UP.
IN THE UK IN JAMAICA AND

920
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
IRELAND, ISLAND NATIONS THAT

921
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
BANNED GUNS, YOU CAN'T FIND A

922
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
PLACE WHERE MURDER RATES HAVE

923
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
GONE DOWN.

924
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
THEY HAVE GONE UP USUALLY BY

925
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
LARGE AMOUNTS.
>> YOU CANNOT FIND A PLACE --

926
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
>> LET ME BRING IN.

927
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, BASICALLY EVERY

928
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
STATISTIC THAT JOHN CITED IS

929
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
PURE BUNK IN TERMS OF THE FACT

930
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
THAT THE MORE GUNS EQUAL --

931
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
THAT'S TRUE.

932
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
THEY WERE GUN-FREE ZONES, BUT

933
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
ATTRIBUTING THAT TO THE FACT

934
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
THAT THIS VIOLENCE OCCURRED,

935
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
THAT'S WHERE I HAVE TO STEP IN.

936
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
LISTEN, MY BROTHER WAS SHOT IN A

937
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
SHOOTING ON TOP OF THE EMPIRE
STATE BUILDING WHICH WAS

938
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
CHAOTIC.
I KNOW FIRSTHAND I TALKED WITH

939
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
THE VICTIMS FROM THE AURORA

940
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
TRAGEDY.

941
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
TO A PERSON, THEY ALL SAY IF

942
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
THERE WERE ANOTHER PERSON ARMED,

943
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
IT WOULD HAVE LED TO MORE

944
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
CARNAGE.
EXCUSE ME.

945
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I LET YOU TALK, LET ME FINISH.

946
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
LET ME FINISH.

947
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
IF EVERY ONE OF THE CASES THEY

948
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
SAY IF THERE WERE MORE GUNS, IT

949
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
WOULD HAVE ONLY LED TO MORE

950
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
CHAOS.

951
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
AT THE EMPIRE BUILDING SHOOTING

952
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
IN NEW YORK.
THERE WERE HIGHLY TRAINED

953
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
OFFICERS IN THE CHAOS AND EIGHT

954
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
OTHER PEOPLE SHOT AND EVERY ONE

955
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
WAS AN INNOCENT CIVILIAN AND
EVERY ONE WAS SHOT BY A LAW

956
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.

957
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
>> WE HAVE THE ATTORNEY FOR THE
RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS.

958
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE

959
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
MORE GUNS IN SCHOOLS.

960
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
SNART?

961
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
>> I BELIEVE THOSE OF US WHO ARE

962
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
LICENSED TO CARRY ARE

963
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE AND SHOULDN'T

964
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
BE PROHIBITED FROM CARRYING IN

965
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
SCHOOLS OR OTHER PLACES.

966
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
IN FACT, THE MICHIGAN

967
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL LAST

968
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
NIGHT AND SENT TO THE GOVERNMENT

969
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
FOR SIGNATURE A BILL THAT WOULD

970
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
ALLOW THOSE OF US WHO ARE

971
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
LICENSED TO TAKE MORE DAY OF

972
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
TRAINING INCLUDING RANGE TIME

973
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
AND BE ABLE TO CARRY IN THE

974
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
PLACES WHERE WE COULDN'T CARRY

975
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
BEFORE.
>> WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU WANT

976
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
MORE GUNS IN SCHOOLS AFTER WHAT

977
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
HAPPENED TODAY?
>> HERE'S WHY, PIERS.

978
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
IF WE COULD SUDDENLY MAKE ALL

979
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
GUNS DISAPPEAR, I WOULD HAVE A

980
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
DIFFERENT POSITION.

981
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME THINKING

982
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
ABOUT THIS AND READING ABOUT

983
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
THIS.

984
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I TEACH A CLASS CALLED GUN

985
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
CONTROL SEMINAR AND I GET A NEW
GROUP EVERY TIME AND WE DISCUSS

986
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
THIS IN DETAIL.

987
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
THE SIMPLE FACTS ARE GUNS EXIST.
THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY 1800s

988
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
TECHNOLOGY.

989
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
SEMI-AUTOMATICS WERE IN THE LATE

990
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
1800s.
THEY ARE EASY TO MAKE AND LAST

991
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
SEVERAL HUMAN LIFETIMES WITH

992
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
MINIMAL MAINTENANCE.

993
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
SINCE GUNS EXIST AND WE KNOW FOR

994
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
A EXACT THAT THE ONLY WAY TO

995
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
STOP AN EVIL PERSON LIKE THE

996
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
PERSON YOU WERE DISCUSSING

997
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
EARLIER IN THE SHOW IS TO SHOOT

998
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
THEM.

999
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
>> THIS IS EXACTLY THE ARGUMENT

1000
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I HAVE BEEN HEARING EVER SINCE I

1001
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
JOINED CNN.

1002
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I JOINED ON AIR ABOUT A WEEK

1003
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
AFTER GABBY GIFFORDS THE

1004
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
CONGRESSWOMAN WAS SHOT IN THE

1005
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
HEAD.

1006
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
EVER SINCE THEN, WE HAVE THE

1007
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
SIKH TEMPLE AND AURORA AND THE

1008
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
SHOPPING MALL AND SO ON AND SO

1009
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
ON.

1010
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
THE ARGUMENT I KEEP HEARING IF

1011
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
EVERYBODY WAS WAS ARMED, IT

1012
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
WOULDN'T HAPPEN.

1013
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
IT'S HOG WASH, ISN'T IT?

1014
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
IF EVERYONE IN THAT MOVIE

1015
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
THEATER HAD GUNS, MORE PEOPLE

1016
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE

1017
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
MAYHEM THAT ERUPTED.

1018
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
>> THE PEOPLE THAT STOPPED THE

1019
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
ATTACKS.

1020
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
>>> CAN I JUST --

1021
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
>> THE PROVE IN THE PUDDING.

1022
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
YOU DON'T SEE OTHER SHOOTINGS AT

1023
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
GUN SHOWS OR --
>> THEY HAVE REASONABLE LAWS AND

1024
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
THEY HAVE 100 PEOPLE A YEAR NOT

1025
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
9,000 OR 10,000 A YEAR.

1026
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
>> LISTEN --

1027
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
>> IT WAS LOWER BEFORE GUN

1028
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
CONTROL.

1029
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
>> THEY GOT THE GUN ZOEL.

1030
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
>> ALMOST ZERO CRIME.

1031
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
>> THE GUN CONTROL DOESN'T

1032
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
CHANGE IT.

1033
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
>> SCOTLAND IN 1996 THERE WAS A

1034
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
SIMILAR SCHOOL SHOOTING.
JUST AN AWFUL SITUATION.

1035
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
16 YOUNG CHILDREN KILLED EXACTLY

1036
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
AS THEY WERE TODAY.

1037
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
AS A RESULT OF THIS, THEY

1038
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
BROUGHT IN A HAND GUN BAN.
162,000 HAND GUNS WERE HANDED

1039
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
IN.

1040
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
IT IS TIME FOR THIS.

1041
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
>> LISTEN --

1042
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
>> MURDER RATES WENT UP.
>> THERE ABOUT 35 MURDERS A

1043
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
YEAR.

1044
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
THERE 12,000 MURDERS A YEAR FROM

1045
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY.

1046
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
WHEN ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO FOCUS

1047
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
ON THAT AND STOP TELLING ME THE

1048
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
ANSWER IS MORE GUNS.

1049
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
IT IS NOT THE ANSWER.

1050
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
>> AFTER THE BAN, IT WAS HIGHER

1051
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE BAN.

1052
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
>> YOU WANT MORE GUNS AND NOT

1053
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
LESS?

1054
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
300 MILLION GUNS IN AMERICA IS

1055
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU?

1056
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
HOW MANY MORE KIDS HAVE TO DIE

1057
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
BEFORE YOU GUYS SAY WE WANT LESS

1058
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
GUNS AND NOT MORE?
>> HE ASKED ME A QUESTION.

1059
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
>> LET HIM ANSWER THE QUESTION.
>> IMUPSET THAT THE GUN CONTROL

1060
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
LAWS YOU ARE PUSHING HAVE KILLED

1061
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
PEOPLE.

1062
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
>> THAT IS NON--Y IS SENSE.

1063
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
NONSENSE.

1064
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
AVERAGE OF 35 KILLINGS IN

1065
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
BRITAIN A GLEER A PLACE OF

1066
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
BANNED HAND GUNS.

1067
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
HERE NO BANS AND 12,000 PEOPLE A

1068
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
YEAR DIE FROM GUN MURDERS.

1069
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
>> YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND YOU

1070
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
BAN THEM --

1071
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
>> I HAVE BEEN DEBATING THIS ALL

1072
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
WEEK WITH THE SHOPPING MALL

1073
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
SHOOTING AND MONTHS IF NOT TWO

1074
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
YEARS.
I AM SO FRUSTRATED AND FURIOUS

1075
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
FOR THESE KIDS WHO ARE BEING

1076
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
BLOWN AWAY AGAIN WITH LEGALLY

1077
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
ACQUIRED WEAPONS.

1078
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
SOME BOY WHO HAS PROBLEMS TAKES
HIS MOTHER'S THREE WEAPONS

1079
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
INCLUDING THIS RIDICULOUS

1080
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
ASSAULT RIFLE AND GOES IN THE

1081
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
SCHOOL AND KILLS THESE KIDS AND

1082
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
YOU GUYS STILL WANT TO TELL ME

1083
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
THE ANSWER IS MORE GUNS?

1084
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
IT IS MADNESS!

1085
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
>> HOW ELSE CAN YOU STOP SOMEONE

1086
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
FROM SHOOTING PEOPLE.

1087
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
WHAT ARE WE MOST ANGRY ABOUT?

1088
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
EVERY POLL SHOWS BY MASSIVE

1089
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
MAJORITIES AMERICANS AGREE WITH

1090
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
WHAT YOU SAID.

1091
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
YET WE HAVE A LOBBY.
THE LEADERSHIP WHO FUNCTION AS

1092
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
LEADERS WHO ARE ENABLERS OF MASS

1093
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
MURDER.

1094
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
POLITICAL PEOPLE AND EVEN THOUGH

1095
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
POLLING SHOWS THAT MOST NRA

1096
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
MEMBERS WOULD SUPPORT REASONABLE

1097
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
GUN CONTROLS, THEY COME IN AND

1098
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
LIE AND SAY THEY WILL TAKE YOUR

1099
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000

00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
REFORMS, THESE CHANGES, AND THE

1277
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
POLLING IS CLEAR.

1278
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
SUPPORT FOR COMMON SENSE GUN

1279
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
REFORM.

1280
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
82 PERCENT GUN OWNERS SUPPORT
UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.

1281
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
IT'S A FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM WE

1282
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
HAVEN'T ARRIVED AT THAT POINT

1283
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
YET.
>> PAULA, YOUR BROTHER WAS

1284
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
KILLED IN THE EMPIRE STATE

1285
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
BUILDING SHOOTING.

1286
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
YOU BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT TO OWN

1287
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
A HANDGUN AND A REFERENDUM

1288
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
WASN'T NEEDED.

1289
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
>> I THINK TODAY A REFERENDUM IS

1290
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,000
NEEDED.

1291
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
AS A FATHER, INNOCENT CHILDREN,

1292
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I SEE THE HEART BREAK, WE HAVE

1293
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
TO GO BACK TO THAT.

1294
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
WE HAVE 20 FAMILIES, 26 FAMILIES

1295
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
THAT ARE DEVASTATED RIGHT NOW,

1296
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
WHILE WE'RE HAVING THIS DEBATE.

1297
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO

1298
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
FOCUS ON.

1299
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
THIS IS ABOUT GUN CONTROL, ABOUT

1300
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
MENTAL ILLNESS AND A

1301
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
COMBINATION.

1302
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
IT'S GOT TO BE ALL GROUPS THAT

1303
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
COME TOGETHER.

1304
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
>> IT INCLUDES VIOLENT VIDEO

1305
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
GAMES, HOLLYWOOD MOVIES.
