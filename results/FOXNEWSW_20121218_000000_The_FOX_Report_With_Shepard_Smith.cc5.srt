00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
WHERE SHE WITNESSED CHILDREN

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
HELPING CHILDREN.

190
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
LISTEN.

191
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000

HI, HOW ARE YOU?

AND JUST -- HE STARTED TO MELT A

201
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
LITTLE BIT.

202
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
AND THEY BROUGHT HIM OVER TO

203
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
WHERE THE TOYS WERE AND THEY

204
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
WERE TALKING TO HIM AND IT

205
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000

>> SHE SAYS EVERY CHILD REACTS

207
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
DIFFERENTLY IN THIS KIND OF

208
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
TRAUMATIC SITUATION, JOHN.

209
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
SHE SAYS THE BOTTOM LINE IS SOME

211
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
WILL HAVE THE PARENTAL SUPPORT.

212
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THEY WILL GET THROUGH THIS.

213
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PUT IT AT

214
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
THE VERY BACK OF THEIR MINDS AND

215
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
LIVE LIKE N A SENSE, AS IF IT

216
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
NEVER REALLY HAPPENED BECAUSE

217
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THEY ARE YOUNG ENOUGH.
FOR OTHERS, THOUGH, SHE SAYS

218
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THEY WILL REMEMBER AND BE

219
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000

BECOME A GREAT MAN AND GROWN UP

230
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
TO BE A GREAT DAD.

231
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
HIS FAMILY WILL NEVER KNOW THAT

PINTO, ALSO SIX YEARS OLD.

235
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
A BIG FAN OF THE NEW YORK

ATTACK.
RICK LEVENTHAL IS LIVE IN SANDY

243
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
HOOK.

244
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE TWO

245
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
SHOOTING VICTIMS WHO SURVIVED?

246
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
>> INITIALLY THE REPORTS WERE

247
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
THERE WAS ONLY ONE GUNSHOT

248
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
VICTIM WHO SURVIVED.
IN FACT, THERE WERE TWO WOMEN

249
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
WHO WERE BOTH HIT IN THEIR LOWER

250
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
EXTREMITIES, BOTH WERE

251
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
HOSPITALIZED AND BOTH HAVE NOW

252
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
BEEN SENT HOME.

253
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
POLICE ARE NOT RELOOSING THEIR

254
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
IDENTITIES, BUT DO PLAN TO TALK

255
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
TO THEM AS SOON AS THEY'RE WELL

256
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
ENOUGH TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT

257
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
THE EVENTS.

258
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
ALSO TODAY, AS YOU MENTIONED,

259
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000

260
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
PROCESS OF FUNERALS AND BURIALS

261
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000

GIANTS FANS WITH ENERGY AND

265
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
STEELY DETERMINATION.

266
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
AND NOAH POZNER, WHOSE TWIN

267
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
SISTER AND EIGHT-YEAR-OLD SISTER

268
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
ALSO ATTENDED SANDY HOOK.

269
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THE GIRLS SURVIVED, BUT THEIR

270
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
BROTHER DID NOT.

271
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
>> HE WAS CELEBRATED AS A PURE,

272
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
INNOCENT CHILD, LIKE A PROMISE

273
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
OF LIFE AHEAD OF HIM WHO BROUGHT

274
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
JOY TO HIS FAMILY AND TO HIS

275
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
COMMUNITY AND WILL BE SORELY

276
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
MISSED.

277
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
AND AS HIS OLDER BROTHER SAID,

278
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
HE COULD HAVE BEEN ANYTHING IF

279
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
HE WOULD HAVE GROWN OLDER.

280
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
IT'S A TRAGEDY OF EPIC

281
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
PROPORTIONS AND WE HAVE NO

282
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
ANSWERS FOR THIS.

283
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
>> TWO MORE FUNERALS ARE

284
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000

287
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
>> YEAH.
THE GOVERNOR SAID THAT YOU TRY

288
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
TO FEEL THEIR PAIN, BUT YOU

289
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
CAN'T.

290
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
THAT WORDS ARE INADEQUATE AND

291
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
THE LITTLE COFFINS ARE HEART

292
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
BREAKING AND HE SAID THE

293
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
SHOOTINGS ON FRIDAY COULD LEAD

294
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
TO A CHANGE IN GUN LAWS.

295
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
>> THERE REALLY ARE NO WORDS TO

296
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
DESCRIBE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SEE

297
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
EVERY HOUSE OF WORSHIP IS BEING

306
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
ASKED TO TOLL ITS BELLS 26 TIMES

307
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
FOR EACH OF THE VICTIMS KILLED

308
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000

312
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000

314
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000

THERE IS NO WORD ON IF OR EVER

934

SCHOOLS REVIEWING WAYS TO BETTER

936
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
PROTECT OUR STUDENTS.

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS

942
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY STROVE TO

943
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
REASSURES PARENTS THAT THEIR

944
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000

PROCEDURES FOR SAFETY DRILLS

946
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
WERE DUSTED OFF AND REVISITED.

LOCAL POLICE TOUCHED BASE WITH

948
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
SCHOOL SECURITY OFFICERS.

949
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
THE MESSAGE TO PARENTS WAS WE'RE

950
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
TRAINED FOR INCIDENTS LIKE THIS.

951
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
>> AS A RESULT OF SOME OF THE
NEW PROCEDURES IN PLACE, I THINK

952
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL

953
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
INSTANCES SINCE COLUMBINE THAT

954
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
WERE STOPPED AS A RESULT OF A

955
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
HEIGHTENED AWARENESS OF SCHOOL

956
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
VIOLENCE.

957
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
>> WHILE SOME SCHOOLS OBSERVED A
MOMENT OF SILENCE, MANY

958
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
PRINCIPALS OPTED NOT TO RAISE

959
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
NEWTOWN AS THE SUBJECT WITH

960
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
SCHOOL CHILDREN.

962

NIGHT, QUOTE, OUR APPROACH WILL

963
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
BE TO ADDRESS IT AS IT COMES UP

964
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
ORGANICALLY WITH STUDENTS.

965
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
SOME OF THE CHILDREN WILL HAVE

966
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
HEARD AND/OR SEEN DETAILS OF THE

967
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
EVENT ON TV, WHILE OTHERS MAY

968
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
HAVE BEEN SHIELDED FROM THE

969
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
MAJORITY OF THE INFORMATION.

970
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I DO NOT WANT ADULT INITIATED

971
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
CONVERSATIONS TO IMPRESS MORE ON

972
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
THE CHILDREN THAN PARENTS

973
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
DESIRE.

974
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
>> WE ALSO HAVE TO BE WATCHING

975
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
OUT FOR CHILDREN BECAUSE

976
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
ESPECIALLY WITH YOUNG CHILDREN,

977
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
IT MAY NOT BE WITH WORDS THAT

978
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
THEY ASK THEIR QUESTIONS.

979
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
IT MAY BE WITH THEIR BEHAVIOR.

980
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
>> SO EXPERTS SAY IF CHILDREN

981
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
ASK YOU ABOUT NEWTOWN, KEEP YOUR

982
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
ANSWERS SHORT AND SIMPLE AND TO

983
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
EMPHASIZE THEY AND THEIR SCHOOLS

984
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
ARE SAFE.

>> John: JAMES ROSEN, THANKS.

987
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
WE NEVER LEAVE A BATTLE BEHIND.

988
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
THAT'S THE BATTLE CRY.

989
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
FOR WHAT FRIENDS AND FAMILY

990
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000

997
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
AND AFGHANISTAN.

998
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
NOW HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE TURNED

999
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
TO SOCIAL MEDIA TO TRY TO WIN

1000
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000

FEELING THE PRESSURE HERE, PHIL?

1006

>> IT IS.

1007
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
NOT SURE HOW MUCH IMPACT THAT'S

1008
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
HAVING.
BUT THE PRESSURE IS COMING FROM

1009
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
OUR OWN CONGRESS, STATE

THAT PRISON ACROSS THE TEXAS

BACK IN FLORIDA BY THEN?

THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE HE HAS

FILED TWO FEDERAL INJUNCTIONS

1045
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000

REGARDLESS OF INTENT, IS

1055
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
CONSIDERED A SERIOUS OFFENSE.

1056
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
HE WAS CAUGHT AT THE BORDERED
WITH A SHOTGUN IN HIS WINNEBAGO

REASON THAT PHOTO SHOWS HIM

SHACKLED WITH THAT LONG CHAIN TO

1066
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
