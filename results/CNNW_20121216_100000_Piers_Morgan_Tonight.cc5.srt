00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
TRAGEDY.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
NO WORDS CAN TRULY EXPRESS HOW

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
HEARTBROKEN WE ARE.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
THIS IS WHERE POLICE ARE TRYING

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO ANSWER THE

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
QUESTIONS WHY.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
THE LANZA HOME, NOT FAR FROM THE

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
SCHOOL.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
IT'S ALSO WHERE THE SUSPECTED

00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
ONE OF THE SHOOTING VICTIMS IN

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, WENT

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
BEFORE CAMERAS TO REMEMBER A

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
CHILD THEY DESCRIBED AS

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
INCREDIBLE BUT IN REMEMBERING

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
LITTLE EMILIE PARKER, THEY SAID,

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
THEY'RE PRAYING FOR THE

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
SHOOTER'S FAMILY, TOO, BECAUSE

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THAT'S WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE
WANTED.

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
KYUNG LAH WAS THERE.

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
KYUNG, WHAT STUCK OUT TO YOU

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
MOST OF ALL WHEN YOU WERE

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
TALKING TO THESE PEOPLE AND YOU

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
WATCHED ALL OF THIS?

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
>> THE ABILITY OF THEM TO BE

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
ABLE TO STILL THINK OF OTHER

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
PEOPLE AND SOCIETY IN THE FACE

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
OF AN UNSPEAKABLE LOSS.

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
IF YOU'RE A PARENT, IF YOU HAVE

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
CHILDREN WHO YOU LOVE AND YOU

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
THINK ABOUT THIS HAPPENING TO

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
YOURSELF, IT'S REALLY HARD TO

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
COMPREHEND, THEN BEING ABLE TO

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
FACE NATIONAL CAMERAS, REPORTERS
AND MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
SOCIETY.

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS FAMILY HAS

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
DONE.

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
AND HERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT

79
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
THEY SAID.

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
>> EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
TWO LITTLE SISTERS AND DELIGHTED

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
IN TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ,

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
DANCE AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
IN LIFE.

85
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
EMILIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
PLEASURE TO MEET HER WOULD AGREE

88
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
THAT THIS WORLD IS A BETTER

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
PLACE BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN IN IT.

90
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
>> EMILIE ALICE PARKER WAS THE

91
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
SWEETEST LITTLE GIRL I'VE EVER

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
KNOWN.

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
MY CHILDREN ARE GRIEVING.

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
MY SIBLINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
ARE GRIEVING AND WE'RE JUST

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
DEVASTATED THAT SOMEONE SO

97
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT IS NO

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
LONGER GOING TO BE IN OUR LIVES

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
AND FOR NO REASON.

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
>> AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
HAPPENED HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
SO MANY PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
INTO SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US.

104
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
BUT SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US

105
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
TO BE BETTER, TO BE MORE

106
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
COMPASSIONATE AND MORE HUMBLE

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
PEOPLE.

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
>> WHAT HE SAID IS THAT HE

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
SIMPLY WANTED PEOPLE TO BE ABLE

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
TO BECOME MORE TOLERANT, TO BE

111
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
MORE HUMANE.

112
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
HE IS HOPING THAT THIS IS GOING

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
TO BE AN EVENT WHERE PEOPLE LOOK

114
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
NOT AT THE SHOOTER, NOT AT THE

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
CRIME ITSELF BUT IN TRYING TO

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
BECOME BETTER PEOPLE FOR THE

117
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
GREATER GOOD OF SOCIETY.

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
IT'S REALLY, TRULY REMARKABLE,

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000

SOTO, SHE ADORED HER STUDENTS

CALLING THEM HER KIDS.

142
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
WHEN THE SHOOTING STARTED, SHE

143
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
DID WHAT SHE COULD TO PROTECT
THEM.

144
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000

SHE TAUGHT FIRST GRADE AT SANDY

EVER SINCE SHE WAS A LITTLE

173
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
GIRL.

HEROIC ACTIONS THAT SHE TOOK IN

HER CLASSROOM WHEN THE GUNMAN

180
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
BURST THROUGH THE DOOR, HOW SHE

181
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
RUSHED THE KIDS INTO A CLOSET TO

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
YOUNG WOMAN, A FRIEND OF SOTO'S

190
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

191
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
JUST LISTEN TO HOW SHE STRUGGLED

192
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
TO TALK ABOUT HOW SHE WILL

193
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
REMEMBER HER.

194
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
>> SHE WAS ALWAYS AT THE HOUSE

195
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
SMILING.

196
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
SHE DROVE US TO CHEERLEADING

197
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
PRACTICES A COUPLE OF TIMES.

198
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'M ALSO A TEACHER AND I CAN'T

199
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
EVEN IMAGINE GOING THROUGH WHAT

200
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
SHE WENT THROUGH.

201
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I THINK HER PUTTING HERSELF OUT

202
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
THERE -- SHE'S JUST AN ANGEL AND

203
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
SHE JUST WENT STRAIGHT INTO

204
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
HEAVEN.

205
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

206
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
>> DON, THE REASON WHY SOTO'S

207
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
FAMILY DECIDED TO HOLD THIS

208
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
VIGIL TONIGHT, THE REASON WHY

209
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
THEY SHOWED UP AND GAVE US

210
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
PICTURES, PICTURES BY THE WAY

211
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
THAT SOTO'S MOTHER PICKED OUT

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
BECAUSE THEY WERE HER FAVORITE

213
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
PICTURES.

214
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
THE REASON WHY THEY DID ALL THIS

215
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
IS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT

216
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
SOTO TO BE REMEMBERED AS JUST A

217
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
VICTIM.

218
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
THEY WANTED HER TO BE REMEMBERED

219
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
AS A DEDICATED TEACHER, A LOVING

220
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
DAUGHTER, A LOVING SISTER.

221
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
AT ONE POINT HER SISTER, CARLEY,

222
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
SHE STOOD UP AND SPOKE TO

223
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
EVERYONE WHO CAME OUT HERE TODAY

224
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
AND SHE SAID THE WORDS THAT SHE

225
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
HAD TWEETED EARLIER TODAY.

226
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
SHE SAID, HUG YOUR LOVED ONES,

227
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
TELL THEM HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THEM

228
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU

229
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
WILL EVER SEE THEM AGAIN.

230
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THESE WERE THE WORDS SPOKEN BY

231
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
HER YOUNGER SISTER, 19-YEAR-OLD

232
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
CARLEY.
THIS IS HOW THEY WANT HER

233
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
REMEMBERED.
DON?

234
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
>> JASON, YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.

235
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
THESE ARE NOT JUST VICTIMS.

236
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
THEY'RE EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE WHO

237
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
HAVE LED EXTRAORDINARY LIVES AND

238
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
TAKEN AWAY WAY TOO SOON.
JASON CARROLL, THANK YOU VERY

239
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
MUCH FOR THAT REPORT.

240
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
WITNESSES SAY THE FIRST SHOTS

241
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
RANG OUT YESTERDAY JUST AFTER

242
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
THE MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE

243
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
BEING READ AT SANDY HOOK

244
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

245
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
POLICE ARE TRYING TO HAMMER DOWN

246
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE

247
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
THAT MOMENT.

248
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
AND OUR TOM FOREMAN HAS A

249
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
BREAKDOWN ON WHAT INVESTIGATORS

250
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
KNOW SO FAR.

251
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
>> POLICE ARE SEARCHING OVER AN

252
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
IMMENSE AREA FOR ANY CLUE WHY
THIS HAPPENED.

253
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
THEY'VE SEARCHED THE BROTHER'S
APARTMENT DOWN HERE IN NEW

254
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
JERSEY.
THEY BELIEVE THE GUNMAN WENT

255
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
DIRECTLY HERE AFTER HIS MOTHER'S

256
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
MURDER AND EMERGED FROM HIS CAR

257
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
IN THE PARKING LOT CARRYING

258
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
WEAPONS VERY MUCH LIKE THESE.

259
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
BUT WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

260
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
LET'S LOOK AT THE TIME LINE

261
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
BASED ON POLICE RADIO REPORTS

262
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
AND EYEWITNESSES.

263
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
9:30 IN THE MORNING, THAT'S WHEN

264
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
WE BELIEVE THAT HE EMERGED FROM

265
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
HIS CAR AND HEADED INTO THE

266
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
SCHOOL HERE.

267
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
WE DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS HIS

268
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
CAR.
BUT THEY'VE PAID A LOT OF

269
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
ATTENTION TO THIS VEHICLE OVER

270
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
THE PAST FEW DAYS.

271
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
HERE IS WHERE HE ENCOUNTERED HIS

272
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
FIRST BARRICADE BECAUSE THERE

273
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
WAS A SECURITY SYSTEM ON THE

274
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
DOORS THERE RECENTLY PUT IN BY

275
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
THE PRINCIPAL, WHERE HE WOULD

276
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
HAVE TO BE BUZZED IN.

277
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
POLICE LATER FOUND THAT THE

278
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
GLASS HERE HAD BEEN SHOT OUT OR

279
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
BROKEN OUT IN SOME FASHION.

280
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
THAT SEEMS TO BE HOW HE ENTERED

281
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
THE SCHOOL.

282
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?

283
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
WELL, THE FIRST CALL TO THE

284
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
POLICE THAT SAID THERE WAS A

285
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
PROBLEM CAME AT 9:36.
THE FIRST CALL SAYING THERE IS

286
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
GUNFIRE INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

287
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE IN THE SCHOOL

288
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
KNEW IT BECAUSE THEY COULD

289
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
EITHER HEAR IT DIRECTLY OR

290
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
BECAUSE THEY HEARD IT OVER THE
SCHOOL'S P.A. SYSTEM, THERE WERE

291
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
ANNOUNCEMENTS BEING MADE AT THE

292
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
TIME.

293
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
ALL THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE IN A

294
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
A VERY SMALL AREA UP IN THIS

295
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
PART OF THE SCHOOL.

296
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY

297
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
ELSE HAVE SOME IDEA THAT THIS

298
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
WAS GOING ON SO THEY COULD TRY

299
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
TO BE SAFE IN THESE

300
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
CIRCUMSTANCES.
BEYOND THAT, WHAT HAPPENED?

301
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
AT 9:38, POLICE WERE SAYING

302
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
ALREADY THEY WERE HEARING

303
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
REPORTS THAT THE SHOOTING WAS

304
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
OVER.

305
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
AN INCREDIBLY SHORT PERIOD OF

306
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
TIME.

307
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
2, 2 1/2 MINUTES, MAYBE, WHERE

308
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
THE BULK, IF NOT ALL OF THE

309
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
SHOOTING TOOK PLACE.

310
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
WHAT WAS THE NEXT PHASE OF ALL
OF THIS?

311
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
THE NEXT PHASE CAME WHEN AT

312
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
ABOUT 9:40, POLICE AT THE SCHOOL

313
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
SAID, WE NEED SOME EMERGENCY

314
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
MEDICAL SERVICES HERE.

315
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THAT WAS THE FIRST CALL FOR

316
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
AMBULANCES.

317
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
IT WAS FOR TWO AMBULANCES TO

318
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
BEGIN WITH AND THEN AS THEY

319
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
REALIZED THEY HAD MANY MORE

320
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
VICTIMS IN A MATTER OF MINUTES,

321
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
THERE WAS A CALL FOR MANY, MANY

322
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
MORE EMERGENCY MEDICAL

323
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
TECHNICIANS AND AMBULANCES TO
COME TO THE SCHOOL.

324
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
AND THEN SURPRISINGLY, BY 9:50

325
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
IN THE MORNING, POLICE WERE

326
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT THEY HAD

327
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
A SUSPECT WHO WAS DOWN, MEANING

328
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
THEY HAD HAD ONE SUSPECT WHO IS

329
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
DEAD, THEY HAD SECURED THE

330
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
BUILDING TO SOME DEGREE.

331
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
THEY'D CLEARED THE BUILDING IS

332
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
THE LANGUAGE THEY USED.
AND A LOT OF THE KIDS WERE BEING

333
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
LED AWAY.

334
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THIS IS A PICTURE FROM "THE
NEWTOWN BEE" OF THE KIDS BEING

335
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
LED AWAY.

336
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
THIS IS A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF

337
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
TIME, FROM 17 TO 20 MINUTES THAT

338
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
THIS WENT FROM NOTHING HAPPENING

339
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
TO ALL OF THESE EVENTS HAPPENING

340
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
THAT HAVE CHANGED THE LIVES OF

341
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
SO MANY PEOPLE.

342
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
AND POLICE WILL CONTINUE GOING

343
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE

344
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
DETAILS OF THE MOVEMENT OF THIS

345
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
SHOOTER AND HIS VICTIMS TO TRY

346
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF

347
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
PRECISELY HOW IT ALL HAPPENED.

348
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
>> TOM, THANKS.

349
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT BUILDING

350
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
AFFECTED EVERYONE.

351
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
THE TRAGEDY IS TOUGH FOR THE

352
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
ENTIRE COMMUNITY HERE.

353
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
AND THOSE NOT DIRECTLY AFFECTED

354
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
STILL WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

355
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
EARLIER, I SPOKE WITH TWO WOMEN

356
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
TRYING TO DO JUST THAT.

357
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
WHEN YOU CAME UP TO TALK TO ME,

358
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
YOU LADIES COULD BARELY GET THE

359
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
WORDS OUT.

360
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
>> THIS IS -- THERE ARE NO
WORDS.

361
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
THERE ARE NO WORDS.

362
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
AND EVEN RIGHT NOW, WE KNOW THAT

363
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
FAMILIES ARE CRYING TOGETHER,
TRYING TO GET THROUGH DAY TO

364
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
DAY.

365
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
AND WE FEEL THAT SINCE WE

366
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
WEREN'T DIRECTLY IMPACTED, WE

367
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
FEEL LIKE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

368
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
USE OUR VOICES TO SAY THINGS

369
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
THAT WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE

370
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
GOING TO BE SAYING FOR A LONG

371
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
TIME AFTER THE CAMERAS ARE GONE.

372
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
AND SOMETIMES IT'S AFTER THE

373
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
CAMERAS ARE GONE THAT THINGS
STOP WORKING.

374
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
AND MOTION STOPS.

375
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
>> FOR YOU, YOU'VE BEEN CRYING

376
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
THE ENTIRE TIME YOU'RE STANDING
HERE.

377
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
>> THERE ARE NO WORDS.

378
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
THERE ARE NO ADEQUATE WORDS TO

379
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
DESCRIBE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE

380
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
AND HOW CHILDREN AND PARENTS AND

381
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
GRANDPARENTS AND UNCLES AND

382
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
AUNTS AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE FAR

383
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
AWAY WHO JUST KNOW THAT WE ARE

384
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
HERE, THERE ARE NO WORDS.

385
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
AND THIS CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE

386
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
ANYWHERE.

387
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
WE NEED TO MAKE OUR CHILDREN

388
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
FEEL SAFE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

389
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW WE CAN DO

390
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I WANT SOMEONE TO GIVE US AN

>> I'M GOING TO SEND THEM TO

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
SCHOOL AS LONG AS I CAN TELL

407
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
THEM THAT SOMEBODY IS DOING

408
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO MAKE THEM

409
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
FEEL SAFE.

410
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
>> HOW OLD ARE YOUR KIDS?

411
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
>> MY DAUGHTER IS 11 AND MY SON

412
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000

>> ARE YOU GOING TO SEND THEM TO

414
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
SCHOOL?

415
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
>> IF I FEEL THAT THEY'RE SAFE,

416
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
IF I FEEL THAT THEY'RE SAFE.

417
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
>> THANK YOU.

418
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE KIND

427
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
OF COVERAGE THAT YOU'RE --
YOU'VE BEEN VERY SENSITIVE.

428
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
>> THOSE WOMEN DIDN'T WANT THEIR

429
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
FACES ON CAMERA.

430
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
THEY SAID WE COULD SHOOT THEM

431
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
FROM THE SIDE BECAUSE THEY HAD

432
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
BEEN CRYING ALL DAY.

433
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
THE REASON THEY CAME HERE, THEY

434
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
SAID THEY WERE WATCHING THE

435
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
BROADCAST EARLIER AND I ASKED,

436
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN TO YOUR

437
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
CHILDREN, WHAT DO YOU DO NEXT?

438
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
AND THIS IS THE NOTE THAT THEY

439
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
WROTE TO ME BEFORE THEY WALKED

440
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
AWAY.

441
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I SAID, PLEASE LET ME PUT IT ON

442
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
CAMERA.

443
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
THEY SAID, EARLIER YOU ASKED

444
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
SOMEONE BEING INTERVIEWED WHAT

445
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
WE WOULD WANT OUR COUNTRY TO DO

446
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

447
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD LIKE.

448
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
RIGHT AWAY, WE NEED SPECIFIC

449
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
PLANS AND ACTIONS TO IMPROVE

450
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
SAFETY FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR

451
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
SCHOOLS BEFORE THEY'RE EXPECTED

452
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
TO RETURN TO SCHOOL.

453
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
WE FEEL WE COULD BETTER ENSURE

454
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
OUR CHILDREN'S SAFETY BY PLACING

455
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
A PERMANENT OFFICER IN EACH OF

456
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
OUR SCHOOLS IN NEWTOWN SO THEY
WILL KNOW THAT SOMEONE IS THERE

457
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING

458
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
THEIR SCHOOL AND THEN THEY WENT

459
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
ON SAYING WHAT ELSE THEY WOULD
LIKE.

460
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
BASICALLY THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE

461
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
THAT THEIR KIDS ARE SAFE WHEN
THEY GO TO SCHOOL.

462
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
THEY SAID THEIR KIDS ARE ASKING

463
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
THEM QUESTIONS THAT THEY CAN'T

464
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
ANSWER AND THEY'RE AFRAID TO GO

465
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
BACK TO SCHOOL IN THE COMING

466
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
WEEKS.

467
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
A LOT OF PARENTS REALLY ARE

468
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS RIGHT

469
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
NOW.

470
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO

471
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
GET THEM ON, PUT THEM ON CAMERA

472
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
AND LET THEIR VOICES BE HEARD.

473
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
TONIGHT, A LOT OF PARENTS

474
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
WATCHING THESE EVENTS AT HOME,

475
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
WHILE THEIR HEARTS ACHE FOR

476
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
THEIR FAMILIES, THEY HAVE TO BE

477
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
WORRIED, THEY HAVE TO BE

478
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
WORRIED.

479
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
COULD IT HAPPEN HERE?

480
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT SCHOOL

481
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
SAFETY IN A MOMENT.

482
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
ALSO A YOUNG MAN WHO RAN TO THE

483
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
SCHOOL WHEN HE HEARD THE SHOTS.

484
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
CALLS A STATE OF DISBELIEF.

THAT NUMBER INCLUDES 12 GIRLS

16 OF THE KIDS WERE ONLY 6 YEARS

527
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000

AT NEWTOWN HIGH SCHOOL.

532
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
YOU ACTUALLY RAN INTO THE SCHOOL

533
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
WHEN YOU HEARD THE SHOTS.

534
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
YOU STAYED HOME FROM SCHOOL THAT

535
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
DAY BY HAPPENSTANCE.

536
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
YOU RAN INTO THE SCHOOL.

537
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
WHAT HAPPENED?

538
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
>> I DID NOT ACTUALLY RUN INTO

539
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
THE SCHOOL BUT I WAS VERY CLOSE

540
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
TO THE PERIMETER OF THE SCHOOL

541
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
AND THAT'S WHERE -- AS SOON AS I

542
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
ENTERED THE DRIVEWAY OF THE

543
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
SCHOOL, WE SAW A LOT OF POLICE

544
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
CARS THERE.

545
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
>> YOU WERE AT HOME.

546
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
DID YOU HEAR SHOTS?

547
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
WHAT DID YOU --

548
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
>> WELL, MY NEIGHBOR CALLED US

549
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
CLAIMING SHE HEARD SHOTS.

550
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
AND THAT'S WHEN WE HEARD A LOT

551
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
OF SIRENS GOING OFF.

552
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
AND THAT'S WHEN WE GOT VERY

553
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
CONCERNED BECAUSE THE SCHOOL DID
NOT PICK UP THE PHONE.

554
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
WE CALLED THE SCHOOL.

555
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
THEY DID NOT PICK UP THE PHONE.

556
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
THAT WAS WHEN WE REALLY BECAME

557
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
CONCERNED.

558
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
>> ONCE YOU GOT THERE, YOU SAID

559
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
YOU GOT TO THE PERIMETER OF THE

560
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
SCHOOL.
>> RIGHT.

561
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
>> ONCE YOU GOT THERE, THEN

562
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
WHAT?

563
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
>> THEN IT WAS JUST HORRIFYING.

564
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
WITHIN A MATTER OF THREE

565
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
MINUTES, WE SAW TWO STUDENTS

566
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
BEING CARRIED OUT BY STATE

567
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
TROOPERS.

568
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
THEY WERE NOT MOVING.

569
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
THEY WERE VERY PALE AND IT WAS

570
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
JUST A VERY HORRIFYING SCENE.
AND THEN A THIRD FEMALE CAME

571
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
OUT.

572
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
SHE HAD A LOT OF BLOOD OVER HER

573
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
FACE.

574
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
IT WAS JUST HORRIBLE.

575
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
IT WAS BLOOD SPLATTER FROM OTHER

576
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
STUDENTS WAS MY GUESS BECAUSE

577
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
SHE WAS WALKING FINE.

578
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
>> THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT

579
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, 5, 6, 7

580
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
YEARS OLD.

581
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
>> YEAH, NO MORE THAN THAT.

582
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

583
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
>> DID YOU FEEL HELPLESS IN NOT
BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING?

584
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S THE

585
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
BEST WORD TO DESCRIBE IT.

586
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
HELPLESS.

587
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I WAS WAITING FOR MY SISTER.

588
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
IT WAS 20 MINUTES BETWEEN THE

589
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
TIME I SAW THOSE OTHER
FEMALES --

590
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
>> YOUR SISTER GOES TO THE
SCHOOL?

591
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
>> YES, SHE DOES.

592
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
>> YOU DIDN'T KNOW --

593
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
>> I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS
HAPPENING TO HER.

594
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
>> YOUR SISTER IS 7?
>> SHE'S 9.

595
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
>> SHE'S 9?

596
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
>> CORRECT.
>> NOT KNOWING IN THOSE

597
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
MOMENTS --

598
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
>> IT WAS HORRIBLE.

599
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
THOUGHTS WERE RUNNING THROUGH MY

600
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
HEAD, ALL MY MEMORIES WITH HER

601
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
WERE RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD

602
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
DURING THOSE 20 MINUTES.

603
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
IT SEEMED LIKE DAYS.

604
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
BUT IT WAS HORRIFYING.

605
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
>> WHEN DID SHE COME OUT?

606
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
>> SHE CAME OUT ABOUT 20 MINUTES

607
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
AFTER THE -- I SAW THE OTHER

608
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
STUDENTS -- THE TWO OTHER

609
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
STUDENTS THAT UNFORTUNATELY WERE

610
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
PRONOUNCED DEAD LATER ON.

611
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
AND THE STUDENTS -- ALL THE

612
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
STUDENTS WERE CRYING AND

613
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
SOBBING.
AND THEY WERE JUST -- THEY WERE

614
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
TRAUMATIZED.

615
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
>> HOW'S YOUR SISTER DOING?

616
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
>> SHE'S DOING WELL.

617
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
AGAIN, SHE'S VERY TRAUMATIZED

618
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
NATURALLY.

619
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
BUT I CREDIT THE TEACHERS FOR

620
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
KEEPING THEM CALM.

621
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
THEY'RE VERY HEROIC TEACHERS

622
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
THAT DAY.

623
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
THE PRINCIPAL, THERE WERE

624
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
MULTIPLE TEACHERS THAT DID A

625
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
FANTASTIC JOB KEEPING THE

626
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
CHILDREN CALM.

627
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
>> WHAT DID YOUR SISTER SAY?

628
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
DID SHE HEAR ANYTHING --

629
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
>> YEAH.

630
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
THE FIRST THING SHE TOLD ME WAS

631
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
THAT SHE HAD HEARD THE INTERCOM

632
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
SYSTEM COME ON AND THROUGH THE

633
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
INTERCOM, SHE HEARD SCREAMS AND

634
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
BULLETS -- SHE HEARD THE

635
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
GUNSHOTS AND THE SCREAMS

636
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
OCCURRING IN THE MAIN OFFICE OF

637
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
THE BUILDING.

638
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHEN THE

639
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
SCHOOL WENT INTO LOCKDOWN.

640
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
>> A 9-YEAR-OLD.

641
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
CAN YOU IMAGINE A 9-YEAR-OLD

642
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
HAVING TO DEAL WITH THAT?
I JUST CAN'T.

643
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
>> IT'S TRAUMATIC.

644
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
>> TELL US -- TALK TO OUR

645
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
VIEWERS AND EVERYONE WHO'S

646
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
WATCHING HERE ABOUT HOW YOU GUYS

647
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
ARE DOING, YOUR SISTER, YOUR

648
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
FAMILY, THE COMMUNITY?

649
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
>> FIRST OFF, I'D REALLY LIKE TO

650
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
GIVE MY CONDOLENCES TO EVERYONE

651
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
WHO'S SUFFERING FROM THIS,

652
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS, IT'S AN

653
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY.

654
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
BUT I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE

655
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
IN NEWTOWN.

656
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
CULTURALLY WE'RE A VERY, VERY

657
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
STRONG TOWN.

658
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
AND WE STICK TOGETHER.

659
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
WE'RE A TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY.

660
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO WORK

661
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
THROUGH THIS.

662
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
EVERYONE CARES ABOUT EVERYONE.

663
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
AND THAT'S JUST WHO WE ARE.

664
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
THAT'S OUR CULTURE.

665
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
>> YOU'RE 17?
>> YES.

666
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
>> THE SHOOTER IS 20.

667
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
DID YOU KNOW HIM?

668
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
>> NO.

669
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
BUT UPON HEARING HE WAS 20, I

670
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
WAS SHOCKED.

671
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I WAS LOST FOR WORDS.

672
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
HOW COULD SOMEONE SO YOUNG

673
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
COMMIT SUCH A HEINOUS ACT.

674
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
>> YOU DON'T KNOW HIS FAMILY?

675
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
>> I DO NOT.

676
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I DO NOT.

677
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
>> THANK YOU.

678
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
>> THANK YOU.

679
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I APPRECIATE IT.

680
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
>> WE'RE GLAD YOUR SISTER IS
OKAY.

681
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
AGAIN, OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS

682
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
ARE WITH EVERYONE HERE.
>> THANK YOU.

683
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
>> APPRECIATE IT.

684
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
>> IT'S GOING TO BE AMAZING JUST
TO WATCH THIS COMMUNITY IN THE

685
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
COMING DAYS TRY TO DEAL WITH

686
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
THIS, TO SEE HOW THEY'RE GOING

687
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
TO COPE, HOW THE WORLD IS GOING

688
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
TO TRY TO HELP THEM GET THROUGH

689
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
IT, WHAT WORDS OF COMFORT THE

690
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
PRESIDENT WILL OFFER THEM AS

691
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
WELL.

692
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
WE'LL BE HERE TO COVER IT FOR

693
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
YOU HERE ON CNN.

694
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
A LITTLE WHILE AGO, I TOOK A

695
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
WALK THROUGH THIS TOWN, THIS

696
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
TOWN OF JUST 27,000 PEOPLE, ALL

697
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
OF THEM STILL TRYING TO PROCESS

698
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
THE HORROR OF WHAT HAPPENED JUST

699
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
DOWN THE ROAD.

700
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
RIGHT BEHIND ME, THAT'S THE ROAD

701
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
THAT LEADS UP TO THE SCHOOL

702
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
WHERE THIS HAPPENED.

703
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
IT HAS BEEN BLOCKED OFF.

704
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
YOU CAN SEE THE SIGN HERE RIGHT

705
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
ACROSS THE STREET ON THAT PORCH,

706
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
IT SAYS, GOD BLESS SANDY HOOK.

707
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
AND RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF

708
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
THE SQUARE, 26 CANDLES FOR ALL

709
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS TRAGEDY

710
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
RIGHT HERE AT THE TIME SQUARE.

711
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
AND UP THE STREET, A CHURCH

712
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
WHERE THE VICTIMS ARE BEING

713
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
MEMORIALIZED.

714
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
THIS IS ONE OF THE INTIMATE
LITTLE SQUARES HERE IN SANDY

715
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
HOOK.

716
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
YOU CAN SEE THE LITTLE QUAINT

717
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
STORES, BEAUTIFUL LITTLE STORES.

718
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
AND THEN COME THIS WAY, YOU CAN

719
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
SEE JUST THE MEDIA.

720
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
AND PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THIS

721
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
SQUARE OVER.

722
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE HERE, THEY

723
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
SAY, THERE'S NEVER THIS MANY

724
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
PEOPLE.

725
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
THERE ARE NEVER THIS MANY PEOPLE

726
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
WHO COME TO THIS TOWN ON A

727
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
SATURDAY OR SUNDAY.

728
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
TO SEE HOW INTIMATE AND

729
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
BEAUTIFUL THIS TOWN IS, LOOK, A

730
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
CREEK THAT RUNS RIGHT THROUGH

731
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
IT.

732
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
THE PEOPLE OF THIS SMALL TOWN

733
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
PROBABLY NEVER DREAMED THAT

734
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THEIR TOWN WOULD BE THE FOCUS OF

735
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
SUCH PAIN AND ANGUISH AND

736
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
SORROW.
THIS IS THE NEWTOWN UNITED

737
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
METHODIST CHURCH AND WHERE A LOT

738
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
OF THE MEDIA ARE CAMPED OUT.

739
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
THERE'S THE CHURCH BEHIND ME.

740
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
IT'S BEEN OPENED NOW FOR 24
HOURS.

741
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
IT'S GOING TO BE OPEN MORE 24

742
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
HOURS FOR AS LONG AS THEY NEED

743
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
IT HERE.

744
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THAT

745
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
CHURCH DIED AND ANYONE WHO WANTS

746
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
TO COME BY AND PAY THEIR

747
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
RESPECTS TO THE PEOPLE WHO DIED,

748
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
ANYONE WHO NEEDS HELP FROM THIS

749
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
CHURCH, THEY CAN COME HERE AND
GET IT.

750
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
AFTER THIS SHOOTING INSIDE SANDY

751
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, THE
SAFETY ISSUE WILL NOW BE FRONT

752
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
AND CENTER AT SCHOOLS ACROSS THE

753
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
COUNTRY.
DO CLASSROOMS NEED TO BE CHANGED

754
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
INTO PANIC ROOMS OR AS I'VE BEEN
SAYING EARLIER, CAN WE MAKE

755
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
CLASSROOMS INTO MINI PRISONS?

756
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT WE MAY HAVE

757
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
TO MAKE OUR SCHOOLS IN ORDER TO
BE SAFE.

758
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I WANT TO BRING IN LOU PALUMBO.
SOME SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE

759
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
ROAMING OFFICERS, METAL

760
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
DETECTORS, OFFICERS ROAMING THE
HALLWAYS.

761
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE OUR

762
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
SCHOOLS SAFER?

763
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
DO WE NEED ALL OF THESE MEASURES

764
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
IN PLACE?

765
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
>> WELL, APPARENTLY BASED ON

766
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
THIS INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE UP

767
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
HERE YESTERDAY, I GUESS YOU

768
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
COULD SUPPORT THAT ARGUMENT.

769
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
IT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE TO THINK

770
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

771
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
CREATE ENVIRONMENTS FOR OUR
CHILDREN TO LEARN IN THAT ARE A

772
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
BIT MORE SECURE.
AND I DON'T THINK MY

773
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ANYTHING
THAT ARE EXTREME.

774
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I MENTIONED TO YOU EARLIER, DON,

775
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
ONE THING I WOULD DO IS LOCK

776
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
THESE CLASSROOM DOORS.

777
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I WOULD CHANGE THE DOORS AND
FORTIFY THE LOCKS AND UPGRADE

778
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
THEM.

779
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
THE SAME ON ENTERING THE
BUILDING.

780
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
THERE'S A CONDITION WHAT WE CALL

781
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
A MANTRAP.

782
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
THAT'S WHEN YOU ENTER FROM AN

783
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
OUTER DOOR INTO A TYPE OF FOYER

784
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
AREA WHERE THERE'S ANOTHER DOOR

785
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
AND THAT DOOR IS SECURED UNTIL
THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH WHO YOU

786
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
ARE.

787
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS

788
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
BIGGER ISSUES THAT ARE NOT JUST

789
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
IMPACTING OUR EDUCATIONAL

790
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
INSTITUTIONS BUT OUR ENTIRE

791
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
COUNTRY.

792
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
IT HAS TO DO WITH YOUR SAFETY,

793
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
OUR PEACE OF MIND.

794
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT A

795
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
CHANCE TO HEAR THE TWO MOTHER

796
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
THAT IS CAME UP AND WROTE ME THE

797
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
LETTER ABOUT WHAT THEY SAY TO

798
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
THEIR KIDS.

799
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
THEY SAY, OUR KIDS ARE ASKING

800
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
ALL THOSE QUESTIONS.

801
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS.

802
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
THEY'RE ASKING US ABOUT GOING

803
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
BACK TO SCHOOL ON MONDAY.
HOW DO YOU REASSURE PARENTS AND

804
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
EVEN STUDENTS THAT THEY'RE SAFE

805
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
AT SCHOOL?
CAN YOU REASSURE THEM?

806
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
CAN YOU BE SURE OF THAT?
>> APPARENTLY YOU CANNOT.

807
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
WHAT I WOULD DO IN THE

808
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
TRANSITIONAL PERIOD IN

809
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
PARTICULAR FOR THESE CHILDREN UP

810
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
HERE, I WOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF

811
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
UNIFORM LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE

812
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
TO EASE THEM THROUGH A

813
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
TRANSITION OF COMFORT AGAIN TO

814
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
WHERE THEY CAN START TO RELAX
AND FEEL A BIT MORE SECURE AND A

815
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
BIT MORE SAFE.
I DON'T THINK THE GRAVITY OF

816
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
THIS SITUATION FOR ALL OF US HAS

817
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
SET IN YET, NOT IN THIS
COMMUNITY AND NOT IN THIS

818
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
NATION.
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALLY HAVE

819
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
THOUGHT THIS THROUGH WHAT THE

820
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
ANGUISH WAS FOR THESE BABIES IN

821
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
THAT CLASSROOM.
IT'S A LITTLE DISTURBING TO EVEN

822
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
SPEAK ABOUT IT.
>> THAT THIS HAPPENS -- I SAID

823
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
AMAZING EARLIER, AND THE

824
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
PERPLEXING SENSE OF THAT WORD

825
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
THAT EVERY TIME WE HEAR ABOUT

826
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
THIS, WE SAY, YOU KNOW, THE

827
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
COMMUNITY'S RESILIENT.

828
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
THEY'LL GET THROUGH IT.

829
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING TO SAY

830
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
THAT.

831
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
>> WITHOUT QUESTION.

832
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
AND WE SHOULDN'T BE BURYING

833
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
CHILDREN AT THIS AGE.

834
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
IT'S SYMPTOMATIC OF A MUCH

835
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
LARGER PROBLEM IN OUR COUNTRY.

836
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
>> I WENT ON THE AIR I THINK IT

837
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
WAS ABOUT 11:40 ON FRIDAY AND I

838
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
WAS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT SAFETY

839
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
AND SECURITY.

840
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
AND I SAID, LOU, YOU SEND YOUR

841
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
KIDS OFF TO SCHOOL AND THIS IS

842
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
THE WORST PHONE CALL THAT YOU
CAN GET.

843
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
THEN WE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS

844
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
JUST SOME ANGRY PARENT OR

845
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
SOMEONE WHO HAD JUST COME IN AND
THAT WAS THE ONLY PERSON

846
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
INVOLVED.

847
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
AND THEN AN HOUR LATER, WE FIND

848
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
OUT IT'S 20 CHILDREN INVOLVED IN

849
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
THIS SHOOTING.

850
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
WE HAVE TO STOP THIS.

851
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT MENTAL HEALTH

852
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
ISSUES AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

853
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
GUN LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY.

854
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
>> WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS

855
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
INTERPRETATION WE HAVE OF THE

856
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
CONSTITUTION.

857
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
AND I WOULD SAY INTERJECT SOME
LEVEL OF COMMON SENSE, DECENCY

858
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
AND SENSIBILITY.

859
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
NO ONE'S OPPOSED TO IS SECOND

860
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
AMENDMENT.
I'M CERTAINLY NOT.

861
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE.

862
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
>> I THINK WHEN PEOPLE SEE US DO

863
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
THIS -- THEY SAY, NO ONE'S

864
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
TRYING TO DO THAT.

865
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE TRYING

866
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
TO MAKE AN ISSUE OF.

867
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
LET'S REALLY TALK ABOUT THIS,

868
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
LOU.

869
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
WE DON'T COVER MULTIPLE
STABBINGS WHERE 20 PEOPLE -- 26

870
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
PEOPLE DIE IN A SCHOOL.

871
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
WE DON'T COVER WHERE MOLOTOV

872
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
COCKTAIL GOES OFF IN THE SCHOOL

873
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE.

874
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
IT'S USUALLY FROM SOMEONE WITH

875
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
SOME TYPE OF ASSAULT WEAPON AND

876
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
SOMEONE WHO HAS A SICK MIND WHO

877
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
GOES IN AND DOES THESE SORTS OF

878
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
THINGS.

879
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
>> THE REAL UNFORTUNATE PART IS

880
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
COUPLED WITH A SICK MIND OR

881
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
DERANGEMENT OR DELUSION, WE HAVE
A VEHICLE OF DELIVERY OF THEIR

882
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
MESSAGE.

883
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
THAT'S WHERE THE FIREARM COMES

884
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
IN.

885
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
WHAT WE SPOKE TO EARLIER IS

886
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
KNOWING A BIT MORE ABOUT THE

887
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
PEOPLE WE'RE PUTTING THESE
FIREARMS IN THE HANDS OF.

888
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
TALKING ABOUT JUST SCREENING

889
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
PEOPLE PSYCHOLOGICALLY.
THIS IS NOT AN ANOMALY.

890
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
THIS IS BECOMING A PATTERN.

891
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
ALTHOUGH THEY WOULD LIKE TO

892
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
STATISTICALLY ADDRESS THIS BY

893
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
SAYING THE NUMBER OF TIMES OR

894
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
THE PERCENTAGE OF THESE

895
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
INCIDENTS IN DIRECT PROPORTION

896
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
TO OUR POPULATION ARE .5%.

897
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
THAT'S A GREAT STATISTIC UNLESS
IT'S YOUR CHILD.

898
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
BUT THERE ARE WAYS WE CAN DO

899
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
THIS.

900
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS

901
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
TAKE THE POLITICAL ASPECT OF

902
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
THIS THING OUT AND SIT DOWN THE

903
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

904
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
CHANGE THE WAY WE'RE ADDRESSING
THIS.

905
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
THIS IS A DISGUSTING PROBLEM

906
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH --

907
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
>> AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

908
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
HAVE TO DEAL WITH.
THANK YOU.

909
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
>> WITHOUT QUESTION.

910
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
>> AND AS YOU SAY, TAKE THE

911
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
POLITICS OUT OF IT.

912
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
IT'S A COMMONSENSE ISSUE, NOT A
LEFT/RIGHT ISSUE.

913
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

914
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
MOST OF US CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE

915
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
HOW THIS CAN HAPPEN.

916
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
BUT SOME PEOPLE CAN BECAUSE THEY

917
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT BEFORE.

918
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
CNN'S JOSH LEVS TELLS US HOW

919
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
VICTIMS OF THE 1999 COLUMBINE

920
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
SHOOTING ARE REACTING TO THIS

921
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000

AND AT THE SUSPECTED KILLER'S

1105
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
LEARNING MORE EACH DAY THAT MAY

1106
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
EXPLAIN WHAT LED 20-YEAR-OLD

ADAM LANZA TO LAUNCH A VICIOUS

1108
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
ATTACK ON YOUNG CHILDREN AND

1109
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
ADULTS AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1110
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
>> OUR INVESTIGATORS AT THE

1111
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
CRIME SCENE, THE SCHOOL AND

1112
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
SECONDARILY AT IF SECONDARY
CRIME SCENE THAT WE DISCUSSED

1113
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
WHERE THE FEMALE WAS LOCATED

1114
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
DECEASED, DID PRODUCE SOME VERY

1115
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
GOOD EVIDENCE IN THIS

1116
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
INVESTIGATION THAT OUR

1117
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
INVESTIGATORS WILL BE ABLE TO

1118
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
USE IN HOPEFULLY PAINTING THE

1119
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
COMPLETE PICTURE AS TO HOW AND

1120
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
MORE IMPORTANTLY WHY THIS

1121
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
OCCURRED.

1122
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
>> Reporter: POLICE WON'T SAY

1123
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
THAT WHAT EVIDENCE IS.

1124
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
HOWEVER, INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN

1125
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
CHECKING OUT GUN RANGES AND

1126
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
SPORTING GOODS STORES.

1127
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
THEY FOLLOWED A LEAD THE SHOOTER

1128
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
TRIED TO BUY A GUN TUESDAY AT
THIS LOCATION.

1129
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
AFTER SEARCHING STORE

1130
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
SURVEILLANCE VIDEOS, THE TIP

1131
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
DIDN'T PAN OUT.

1132
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
>> TO DATE, ATF HAS NOT

1133
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
UNCOVERED ANY INFORMATION THAT

1134
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
WOULD SUBSTANTIATE THE FACT THAT
HE TRIED TO ACQUIRE GUNS

1135
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
RECENTLY.

1136
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
WE'RE ACTIVELY INVESTIGATING.

1137
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
>> Reporter: FEDERAL GUN AGENTS

1138
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
ALSO SAID THEY RECOVERED WEAPONS

1139
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
AT THE HOME THE SHOOTER SHARED

1140
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
FROM HIS MOTHER.

1141
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
SOURCES SAY THREE MORE GUNS WERE

1142
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
FOUND.

1143
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
THESE THREE RIFLE MODELS, ALL

1144
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
OLDER ARE BEING TRACED.

1145
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
AT LEAST ONE HAS BEEN CONNECTED

1146
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
TO THE MOTHER.

1147
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
THREE MORE WEAPONS WERE

1148
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
DISCOVERED WITH THE SHOOTER IN A

1149
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
CLASSROOM WHERE HE TOOK HIS OWN

1150
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
LIFE.

1151
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
ACCORDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

1152
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
OFFICIALS, THE TWO HANDGUNS AND

1153
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC LONG GUN CALLED A

1154
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
BUSHMASTER WERE BOUGHT LEGALLY

1155
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
BY HIS MOTHER.

1156
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER SAYS

1157
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
THAT LONG GUN WAS USED TO KILL

1158
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
SEVERAL VICTIMS.

1159
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
>> I ONLY DID SEVEN OF THE

1160
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
AUTOPSIES.

1161
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
THE VICTIMS I HAD RANGED FROM

1162
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
THREE TO 11 WOUNDS APIECE.

1163
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I ONLY SAW TWO OF THEM WITH

1164
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
POSTRANGE SHOOTING.

1165
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
ALL THE WOUNDS THAT I KNOW OF AT

1166
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
THIS POINT WERE CAUSED BY THE

1167
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
LONG WEAPON.

1168
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
>> Reporter: ONE RELATIVE

1169
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
DESCRIBES THE SHOOTER AS BEING A

1170
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
VERY BRIGHT YOUNG MAN WHO AT
TIMES WAS HOMESCHOOLED BY HIS

1171
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
MOTHER.

1172
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL TELLS

1173
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
US THAT HIS OLDER BROTHER SAYS

1174
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
THAT HIS YOUNGER BROTHER WAS
AUTISTIC.

1175
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
BUT SO FAR, NOTHING ADDS UP TO A

1176
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
MOTIVE.

1177
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN, NEWTOWN,

1178
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
CONNECTICUT.

1179
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
>> THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER HAS

1180
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
EMERGED AS ONE OF THE MORE

1181
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
MYSTERIOUS FIGURES IN THE

1182
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
INVESTIGATION.

1183
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
HER SON APPARENTLY USED ONE OF

1184
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
HER OWN GUNS TO KILL HER.

1185
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
BUT THERE'S STILL SO MUCH WE

1186
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
DON'T KNOW ABOUT HER.

1187
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
CNN'S DAVID ARIOSTO JOINS US NOW

1188
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
WITH WHAT'S NEW ON THIS.

1189
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
DAVID, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT

1190
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
NANCY LANZA?

1191
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
>> RIGHT HERE, WE'RE HERE IN

1192
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
FRONT OF NANCY LANZA'S HOUSE.

1193
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
IT'S A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN

1194
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
THE ROAD.

1195
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
WE'VE BEEN DIGGING ON THAT VERY
QUESTION.

1196
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
IT'S AN INCOMPLETE PICTURE AS TO

1197
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
WHO THIS WOMAN REALLY WAS.

1198
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
WE SPOKE WITH NEIGHBORS IN THE

1199
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
AREA HERE.

1200
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
MANY OF THEM HAVE RECALLED A

1201
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
PERSON WHO IS A VERY PLEASANT

1202
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
PERSON TO TALKING WITH, LOVED

1203
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
GARDENING, LOVED LANDSCAPING.

1204
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
WOULD OFTEN ATTEND THESE SORT OF

1205
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
DICE GAME, LADIES NIGHT

1206
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
GET-TOGETHERS EVERY SO OFTEN,

1207
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
PERHAPS EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS.

1208
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
SHE WAS THE KIND OF WOMAN THAT

1209
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
SORT OF LEANED ON HER NEIGHBORS

1210
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
BUT WAS ONLY REALLY FAMILIAR

1211
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
WITH SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS IN

1212
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY.

1213
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
YOU KIND OF THINK OF YOUR OWN

1214
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
NEIGHBORHOOD AND HOW MANY

1215
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
NEIGHBORS YOU ACTUALLY KNOW
OUTSIDE THOSE INITIAL FEW

1216
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
BLOCKS.

1217
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
SO THE NEIGHBORS THAT WE DID GET

1218
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
TO SPEAK WITH DID GET TO KNOW

1219
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
NANCY, BUT IT'S REALLY NOT ALL

1220
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
THAT CLEAR WHAT WAS BEHIND THE

1221
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
SCENES.

1222
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
SHE MOVED HERE IN 1998 WITH HER

1223
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
HUSBAND.

1224
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
THEY HAD TWO BOYS.

1225
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
SHE LATER DIVORCED AND RAISED

1226
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
HER TWO BOYS IN THIS AREA.

1227
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
WHAT TRANSPIRED LATER, HOWEVER,

1228
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
IS REALLY SOMEWHAT UNCLEAR

1229
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
BECAUSE THERE'S THIS OTHER SIDE

1230
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
TO NANCY.

1231
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
SHE HAD SEVERAL GUNS AND ONE

1232
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
INDIVIDUAL THAT I SPOKE TO, A

1233
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
BUSINESS OWNER, SAID THAT AT ONE

1234
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
POINT SHE EVEN BRANDISHED A

1235
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
RIFLE THAT SHE HAD RECENTLY

1236
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
PURCHASED.

1237
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
THIS INDIVIDUAL ALSO SAID THAT

1238
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
SHE WOULD GO TARGET SHOOTING.

1239
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THAT OCCURRED

1240
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
AT A RANGE OR JUST AROUND ON

1241
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
CERTAIN TREES OR WHAT ACTUALLY

1242
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
HE MEANT BY THAT.

1243
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
BUT THEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ATF

1244
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
AND FBI OFFICIALS SAID

1245
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
ESSENTIALLY THAT WASN'T THE
CASE.

1246
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
THEY WEREN'T AT A SHOOTING

1247
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
RANGE.

1248
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
THAT DIDN'T OCCUR.

1249
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
BUT REALLY WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

1250
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
HERE ARE TRYING TO GET ANSWERS

1251
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
TO IS JUST WHAT MOTIVATED HER

1252
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
SON TO DO THIS?

1253
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
WHAT TRANSPIRED INSIDE THE

1254
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
HOUSE -- AND THERE'S A LOT OF

1255
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
PEOPLE REALLY REELING FROM THIS

1256
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
AND LEFT WITH THIS SORT OF A

1257
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
SPEECHLESS QUALITY ABOUT IT,

1258
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
EVEN A DAY AFTER.

1259
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I KNOW MYSELF, I WENT DOWN TO

1260
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
THE FIREHOUSE JUST YESTERDAY AS

1261
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
FAMILIES WERE COMING OUT OF THIS

1262
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
FIREHOUSE THAT WAS MEANT TO BE A

1263
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
WEIGH STATION.

1264
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
AND TOWARD THE EARLY MORNING

1265
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
HOURS OF THAT TUMULTUOUS DAY,

1266
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
YOU'D SEE FAMILIES WALKING OUT

1267
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
WITH LOVED ONES, CHILDREN WHO

1268
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
WERE TEARY-EYED, SHAKEN BUT

1269
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
CLEARLY THEY WERE WALKING OUT

1270
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

1271
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
AND AS THE DAY PROGRESSED, THESE

1272
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
FAMILIES WOULD WALK OUT

1273
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
CHILDLESS.

1274
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THESE

1275
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
THINGS THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

1276
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
AN EASY END EVEN AS THE DAYS --

1277
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
>> AND DAVID, CLEARLY IT BREAKS

1278
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
YOUR HEART.

1279
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
AS YOU SAID, THERE ARE A LOT OF
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.

1280
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
THERE WERE SOME INITIAL REPORTS

1281
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
THAT SHE, NANCY LANZA,

1282
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
ORIGINALLY WORKED FOR THE

1283
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
SCHOOL.

1284
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
BUT THAT ISN'T TRUE, IS IT?

1285
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
>> A LOT OF INFORMATION COMING

1286
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
IN FROM ALL ANGLES HERE THAT WE

1287
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
GET IN.

1288
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
IT SEEMS CREDIBLE.

1289
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
AND THEN IT TURNS OUT NOT TO BE

1290
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
THE CASE.

1291
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
THERE WERE SOME INITIAL LOCAL

1292
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
REPORTS THAT INDICATED THAT SHE

1293
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
MIGHT HAVE WORKED IN THE SCHOOL

1294
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
SYSTEM.

1295
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
WHAT WE LATER FOUND OUT IS THAT

1296
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
SHE ACTUALLY HAD A BACKGROUND IN

1297
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
FINANCE AND HAD TAKEN SOME TIME

1298
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
OFF AND WAS STAYING HERE.

1299
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
WHAT HER CONNECTION WAS TO THE

1300
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
SCHOOL IS UNCLEAR.

1301
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
IF THERE'S ANY, WHICH ALSO

1302
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
RAISES MORE QUESTIONS AS TO WHY

1303
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
HER SON CHOSE THIS SCHOOL TO GO

1304
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
IN AND COMMIT THIS HEINOUS ACT.

1305
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
>> DAVID ARIOSTO, THANK YOU VERY

1306
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
MUCH FOR YOUR REPORTING.

1307
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
WE KNOW THE SHOOTER HAD THREE

1308
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
GUNS WITH HIM INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

1309
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
THOSE GUNS WERE REGISTERED TO

1310
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
HIS MOTHER.

1311
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW HE GOT

1312
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
THEM.

1313
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
SO CAN ANYONE BE HELD
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DEADLY

1314
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
ATTACK?

1315
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
KAREN CONTI IS A TRIAL ATTORNEY

1316
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
IN CHICAGO.

1317
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
CAN WE EXPECT LAWSUITS TO BE

1318
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
FILED AND AGAINST WHOM?

1319
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
>> LAWSUITS GET FILED FOR A LOT

1320
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
OF REASONS OTHER THAN MONEY

1321
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY MONEY DOESN'T

1322
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
REPLACE CHILDREN.

1323
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE FILE LAWSUITS TO

1324
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
GET INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN'T

1325
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
OTHERWISE GET THROUGH THE

1326
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
AUTHORITIES.

1327
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
SOMETIMES THEY JUST WANT TO

1328
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
BLAME SOMEONE FOR AND HOLD
SOMEONE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE

1329
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
SENSELESS VIOLENCE.

1330
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
AND SOMETIMES THEY JUST WANT TO

1331
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
CHANGE THINGS IN THE FUTURE,

1332
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
MAYBE CHANGE THE LAWS AND THE

1333
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
SAFETY PROCEDURES.

1334
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
SO JUST A NOTE ABOUT THAT, THE

1335
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
PARENTS WHO ARE ANGRY AND UPSET

1336
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
ABOUT THESE THINGS WILL BRING

1337
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
LAWSUITS.

1338
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
NOW, I JUST DON'T SEE A VIABLE

1339
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
LAWSUIT HERE BECAUSE WHO ARE YOU

1340
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
GOING TO SUE?

1341
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
THE SCHOOL SEEMED LIKE THEY DID

1342
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
A GREAT JOB, THEY HAD THE

1343
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
PRECAUTIONS IN PLACE.

1344
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
THIS WAS AN ADULT PERSON WHO DID
THIS.

1345
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
YOU CAN'T HOLD THE PARENTS

1346
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
RESPONSIBLE.

1347
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I DON'T REALLY SEE A VALID

1348
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
LAWSUIT.

1349
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
>> YEAH.

1350
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION

1351
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
BECAUSE THE LEGAL DEFENSE HERE

1352
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
WOULD BE THE FACT THAT THE

1353
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
SUSPECT IS OVER THE AGE OF 18.

1354
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
HE IS AN ADULT.

1355
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
THEREFORE, HE'S THE ONLY ONE

1356
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS.

1357
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
BUT THEY WERE NOT HIS GUNS.

1358
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
MAYBE HE SHOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
ACCESS TO THE GUNS.

1359
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
BUT THE PERSON THE GUNS BELONGED

1360
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
TO IS NOW DECEASED.

1361
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1362
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE

1363
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
FAMILIES COULDN'T SUE THE ESTATE

1364
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
OF THE MOTHER.

1365
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PROVE

1366
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
THAT SHE IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR

1367
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
FORM KNEW THAT HE HAD THE

1368
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
PROPENSITY TO DO THIS AND THIS

1369
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
INDIVIDUAL HAD ASPERGER'S

1370
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
SYNDROME, WHICH IS A FORM OF

1371
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
AUTISM.

1372
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
BUT IT HAS NO RELATION TO

1373
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
VIOLENCE.

1374
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
BUT IF SHE HAD PRIOR

1375
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
KNOWLEDGE -- BUT EVEN THAT IS

1376
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
VERY TENUOUS.

1377
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
>> IN OREGON, WE SAW THE GUNS

1378
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
BEING STOLEN.

1379
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
WE SAW HERE THE GUNS BELONGED TO

1380
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
THE MOTHER AND HE GOT ACCESS TO

1381
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
THE GUNS.

1382
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE SOME

1383
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
CHANGES IN THE LAW HERE BECAUSE

1384
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
OF WHAT HAPPENED?

1385
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
>> I THINK WHAT WE SAW IN

1386
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
CONNECTICUT IS JUST PRIOR TO

1387
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
THIS, AFTER THE AURORA,

1388
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
COLORADO, THEATER SHOOTING, THEY

1389
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
TRIED TO CHANGE THE LAWS AND

1390
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE STRINGENT.

1391
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
BUT THERE WAS SUCH PROTEST THAT

1392
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
IT ALL GOT STRICKEN DOWN.

1393
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I DO SEE, THOUGH, THAT WE HAVE A

1394
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
LAW IN ILLINOIS CALLED THE

1395
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
ILLINOIS SCHOOL SAFETY DRILL ACT

1396
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
WHICH REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO

1397
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
ANNUALLY HAVE DRILLS TO KIND OF

1398
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
PREPARE FOR NOT ONLY THESE KINDS

1399
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
OF THINGS BUT WEATHER ISSUES,

1400
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
TORNADOES, FIRES AND THE LIKE,
EVACUATION PROCEDURES IN PLACE,

1401
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
P.A. SYSTEMS, ET CETERA.

1402
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE A

1403
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
MASSIVE AMOUNT OF LEGISLATION

1404
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY REQUIRING

1405
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
SCHOOLS TO DO THIS.

1406
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
>> KAREN CONTI, THANK YOU.

1407
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
EARLIER ONE OF THE MOST

1408
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
COMPELLING MOMENTS OF THIS

1409
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
TRAGEDY, A FATHER WHO LOST HIS

1410
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
DAUGHTER IN THE SHOOTING,

1411
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
BRAVELY TELLS THE WORLD ABOUT

1412
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
THE LITTLE GIRL THAT NOT ONLY HE

1413
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
LOST BUT ONE OF THE MANY THAT WE
ALL LOST.

1414
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
THAT'S NEXT.

1415
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
[ Female Announcer ] BORN
FROM THE SWEET MONK FRUIT,

1416
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
SOMETHING THIS DELICIOUS
COULD ONLY COME FROM NATURE.

1417
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
NEW NECTRESSE.

1418
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
THE 100% NATURAL
NO-CALORIE SWEETENER

1419
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
MADE FROM THE GOODNESS
OF FRUIT.

1420
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
NEW NECTRESSE.

1421
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
SWEETNESS NATURALLY.

1422
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
NEW NECTRESSE.

1423
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Wooohooo....Hahaahahaha!

1424
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Oh...there you go.

1425
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Wooohooo....Hahaahahaha!

1426
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I'm gonna stand
up to her!

1427
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
No you're not.
I know.

1428
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You know Ronny folks who save
hundreds of dollars

1429
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
switching to GEICO
sure are happy.

1430
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
How happy are they Jimmy?

1431
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Happier than a witch in
a broom factory.

1432
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Get happy. Get GEICO.

1433
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Fifteen minutes could save you
fifteen percent or more.

1434
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
to treat
your anti-aging concerns?

1435
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Join the counter revolution
and switch to Olay Pro-X.

1436
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000

1437

so you look
up to 12 years younger.

1438

See results in 28 days.

1439
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Guaranteed or your money back.

1440
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Olay Pro-X.

1441
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
>>> WE HAVE A QUICK UPDATE ON

1442
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
TODAY'S DEVELOPMENTS IN NEWTOWN,

1443
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
CONNECTICUT.
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA COMING

1444
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
HERE TOMORROW TO MEET WITH THE
VICTIMS' FAMILIES.

1445
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
HE'S ALSO EXPECTED TO ATTEND AN

1446
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
INTERFAITH VIGIL SCHEDULED TO BE

1447
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
HELD TOMORROW EVENING.

1448
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
THE SHOOTER'S FATHER, PETER

1449
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
LANZA, ISSUED A STATEMENT

1450
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
TONIGHT OFFERING HIS CONDOLENCES

1451
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
TO THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES.

1452
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
AND WE HAVE LEARNED MORE ABOUT

1453
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
THE VICTIMS INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

1454
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
SIX WOMEN AND 20 STUDENTS DIED

1455
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
THERE.

1456
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
12 GIRLS, EIGHT BOYS, ALL 6 OR 7

1457
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
YEARS OLD.

1458
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
THE STATE'S CHIEF MEDICAL

00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
EXAMINER SAYS ALL OF THEM DIED

1460
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
FROM GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

1461
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE

1462
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
NOW TRYING TO EMOTIONALLY HANDLE

1463
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
THIS TRAGEDY, FRIENDS, FAMILY

1464
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
AND RESIDENTS OF NEWTOWN,

1465
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
CONNECTICUT, TRYING TO START

1466
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
DOWN THAT ROAD TO RECOVERY RIGHT

1467
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
NOW.

1468
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
OUR DR. SANJAY GUPTA VISITED A

1469
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
GRIEF CENTER TODAY AND HE TALKED

1470
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
TO SOME OF THEM.

1471
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
LISTEN TO WHAT HE TOLD ANDERSON

1472
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
EARLIER.

1473
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
>> WHEN WE GOT THERE, THERE WERE

1474
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
LITERALLY 100 CARS IN THE

1475
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
PARKING LOT.

1476
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
WE WEREN'T FILMING ANYTHING OUT

1477
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
OF RESPECT FOR PEOPLE'S PRIVACY.

1478
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
BUT PEOPLE WERE WALKING OUT WITH

1479
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
CHILDREN, PROBABLY CHILDREN FROM

1480
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
THE SCHOOL, A LOT OF PARENTS

1481
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
WALKING WITH THEM INTO THE

1482
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
SCHOOL.

1483
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
AND THERE WERE PSYCHIATRISTS,
PSYCHOLOGISTS, CHILDREN'S

1484
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
COUNSELORS IN THE SCHOOL.

1485
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I THINK WHAT WAS STRIKING IS

1486
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
PEOPLE WERE GOING IN AND THEY

1487
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
WERE STAYING IN FOR A LONG TIME.

1488
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
THIS WAS SORT OF A GRIEVING BUT

1489
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
ALSO HEALING GOING ON.

1490
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
ALSO THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT THE

1491
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
COMMUNITY WAS SORT OF AN

1492
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
INDIVIDUAL, MEANING THAT YOU SAW

1493
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
THAT SOMEONE ELSE WAS GOING

1494
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
THROUGH THE SAME THING YOU WERE.

1495
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
AND PEOPLE WERE BEING COMFORTED

1496
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
BY THAT IN SOME WAY.

1497
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
>> IT'S INTERESTING.

1498
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I WAS TALKING TO MY MOM WHO LOST

1499
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
A SON, MY BROTHER.

1500
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
AND SHE WAS SAYING FOR HER, IT

1501
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
HELPED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

1502
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
AND I'VE HEARD THAT FROM A LOT

1503
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
OF PEOPLE HERE, THAT IT HELPS TO

1504
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
TALK.

1505
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
AND YET OTHER PEOPLE KIND OF

1506
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
AREN'T READY TO TALK ABOUT IT OR

1507
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT AT THIS

1508
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
POINT.
>> YEAH.
I THINK THE TIMING SEEMS TO BE

1509
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE

1510
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
WHICH IS WHY I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

1511
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
TO EXPECT WHEN I WENT TO THAT
CRISIS CENTER TODAY.

1512
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THIS COMMUNITY

1513
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
FOR THE MOST PART IS READY TO

1514
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
TALK.

1515
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SMALL SAMPLE
SIZE.

1516
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
BUT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT.

1517
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
AND THE FEELING OF ISOLATION,

1518
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
THINKING THAT I'M GOING THROUGH

1519
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
THIS ALONE, THAT NO ONE QUITE

1520
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
UNDERSTANDS WHAT THIS HAS DONE

1521
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
TO ME CAN BE QUITE PAINFUL AND

1522
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
QUITE DAMAGING LONG TERM AS

1523
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
WELL.

1524
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
IF YOU SEE OTHER PEOPLE GOING

1525
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
THROUGH IT -- EVEN JUST BEING

1526
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
THERE IN THE CRISIS CENTER WITH

1527
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
OTHER PEOPLE, I THINK, SEEMED TO

1528
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
BE THERAPEUTIC FOR THEM.

1529
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
>> AND A LOT OF PARENTS HERE AND

1530
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
AROUND THE WORLD ARE TRYING TO

1531
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
FIGURE OUT HOW TO TALK TO THEIR

1532
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
KIDS ABOUT IT.

1533
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I TALKED TO SOME PARENTS LAST

1534
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
NIGHT WHOSE KIDS WERE IN THE

1535
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
SCHOOL AND THANKFULLY HAD
SURVIVED.

1536
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
AND THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE

1537
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
WAITING FOR THEIR CHILD TO KIND

1538
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
OF BRING IT UP TO THEM.

1539
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
AND THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT.

1540
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
>> YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THEY

1541
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
KNOW.
OBVIOUSLY THE CHILDREN IN THE

1542
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
SCHOOL KNOW.
BUT EVEN OTHER CHILDREN IN THE

1543
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
COMMUNITY KNOW, EVEN IF THEY

1544
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
HAVEN'T BEEN WATCHING TELEVISION

1545
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
JUST IN TODAY'S DAY AND AGE.

1546
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
THE THING THAT KEEPS COMING BACK

1547
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
IS THEY SORT OF DIRECT THE

1548
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
CONVERSATION.

1549
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
SO YOU SORT OF GET YOUR OWN

1550
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
FEELINGS IN CHECK FIRST AS AN

1551
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
ADULT OR AS A PARENT.
AND THEN YOU FILL IN DETAILS AS

1552
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
APPROPRIATE, AS AGE APPROPRIATE,

1553
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
LEAVING OUT OBVIOUSLY GRAPHIC

1554
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
DETAILS.

1555
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
BUT THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT YOU

1556
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
DON'T WANT TO BE FALSE OR YOU

1557
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
WANT TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT IN

1558
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
TERMS OF WHAT YOU TELL THEM -- I

1559
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH MY

1560
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
DAUGHTER.

1561
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
SHE STARTED ASKING ABOUT SOME OF

1562
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
THE NAMES OF THE CHILDREN.

1563
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THEY

1564
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
IMMEDIATELY WANT TO HUMANIZE

1565
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
THIS IN SOME WAY FOR THEMSELVES.

1566
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
IT'S A TOUGH CONVERSATION TO

1567
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
HAVE.

1568
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
SHE WANTED TO KNOW IF HER SCHOOL

1569
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
WAS GOING TO BE SAFE.

1570
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I HAD TO SAY, LOOK, DADDY'S

1571
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
SCHOOL NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN TO

1572
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
HIM.

1573
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
MOMMY'S SCHOOL NEVER HAD IT

1574
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
HAPPEN TO HER.
BUT THIS OBVIOUSLY HAPPENED.

1575
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
WE DO THE BEST WE CAN TO KEEP

1576
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
YOU SAFE.

1577
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
IT'S TOUGH BUT AN IMPORTANT

1578
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
CONVERSATION.

1579
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
>> AND ONE FATHER REFUSES TO

1580
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
THINK OF HIS DAUGHTER AS JUST

1581
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
THE VICTIM OF A HORRIBLE CRIME.

1582
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
THIS IS HOW ROBBIE PARKER SAYS
HE'LL REMEMBER HIS 6-YEAR-OLD

1583
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
LITTLE GIRL.

1584
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
>> I'D REALLY LIKE TO OFFER OUR

1585
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO THE

1586
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
FAMILIES WHO WERE DIRECTLY

1587
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
AFFECTED BY THIS SHOOTING.

1588
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
IT'S AN HORRIFIC TRAGEDY AND WE

1589
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT OUR

1590
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO OUT TO

1591
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
THEM.

1592
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
THIS INCLUDES THE FAMILY OF THE

1593
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
SHOOTER.

1594
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD THIS

1595
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
EXPERIENCE MUST BE FOR YOU AND I

1596
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR FAMILY

1597
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
AND OUR LOVE AND OUR SUPPORT

1598
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
GOES OUT TO YOU AS WELL.

1599
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
MY DAUGHTER, EMILIE, WOULD BE

1600
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE

1601
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
STANDING AND GIVING HER LOVE AND
SUPPORT TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS

1602
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF

1603
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
PERSON THAT SHE IS, NOT BECAUSE

1604
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
OF ANY PARENTING THAT MY WIFE

1605
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
AND I COULD HAVE DONE, BUT

1606
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE GIFTS

1607
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY HER

1608
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
HEAVENLY FATHER.

1609
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I HAVE TWO REALLY GOOD FRIENDS

1610
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
AT HOME WHO HAVE SET UP A

1611
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
FACEBOOK PAGE TO HELP RAISE

1612
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
MONEY FOR EMILIE.

1613
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
WHEN I'VE GOTTEN ON THAT AND

1614
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
SEEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

1615
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
HAVE COMMENTED AND EXPRESSED

1616
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
THEIR CONDOLENCES, IT'S BEEN
QUITE OVERWHELMING.

1617
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

1618
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

1619
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

1620
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

1621
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
WAS AND HOW MANY LIVES THAT SHE

1622
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
WAS ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT

1623
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
TIME HERE ON EARTH.

1624
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

1625
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
VERY LOVING.

1626
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
EMILIE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO TRY

1627
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
NEW THINGS, OTHER THAN FOOD.

1628
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
SHE LOVED TO USE HER TALENTS TO

1629
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
TOUCH THE LIVES OF EVERYONE THAT

1630
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
SHE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH.

1631
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
SHE WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL ARTIST

1632
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
AND SHE ALWAYS CARRIED AROUND

1633
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
HER MARKERS AND PENCILS SO SHE

1634
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
NEVER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO

1635
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
DRAW A PICTURE OR MAKE A CARD

1636
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
FOR THOSE AROUND HER.

1637
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF

1638
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
TIMES EMILIE NOTICED SOMEONE

1639
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
FEELING SAD OR FRUSTRATED AND

1640
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
WOULD RUSH TO FIND A PIECE OF

1641
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
PAPER TO DRAW THEM A PICTURE OR

1642
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
TO WRITE THEM AN ENCOURAGING
NOTE.

1643
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
EMILIE'S CARD MAKING WAS

1644
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
EXPRESSED BEAUTIFULLY THIS LAST

1645
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
OCTOBER WHEN SHE PLACED A VERY

1646
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
SPECIAL CARD SHE HAD MADE INTO

1647
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
THE CASKET WITH HER GRANDPA, WHO

1648
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
ALSO JUST RECENTLY DIED OF A

1649
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
TRAGIC ACCIDENT.

1650
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER TWO

1651
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
LITTLE SISTERS AND DELIGHTED IN

1652
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ, DANCE

1653
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS IN
LIFE.

1654
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
EMILIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS

1655
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE

1656
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
PLEASURE TO MEET HER WOULD AGREE

1657
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
THAT THIS WORLD IS A BETTER

1658
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
PLACE BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN IN IT.

1659
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
SHE WAS THEIR BEST FRIEND.

1660
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
THEY WERE ALL BORN WITHIN THREE

1661
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
YEARS OF EACH OTHER SO BY LAW,

1662
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE.

1663
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
SHE WAS TEACHING MY MIDDLE

1664
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
DAUGHTER TO READ.

1665
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
SHE WOULD HELP MY YOUNGEST

1666
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
DAUGHTER LEARN HOW TO MAKE
THINGS, SHOW HER HOW TO DO

1667
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
CRAFTS.

1668
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
THEY LOOKED UP TO HER AND THEY
LOOKED TO HER WHEN THEY NEEDED

1669
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
COMFORT.

1670
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
USUALLY THAT'S SAVED FOR A MOM

1671
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
AND A DAD.

1672
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
BUT IT WAS REALLY SWEET TO SEE

1673
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
THE TIMES WHEN ONE OF THEM WOULD

1674
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
FALL OR GET THEIR FEELINGS HURT,

1675
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
HOW THEY WOULD RUN TO EMILIE TO

1676
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
GET SUPPORT AND HUGS AND KISSES.

1677
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT

1678
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
COULD JUST LIGHT UP A ROOM.

1679
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING KIND TO

1680
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
SAY ABOUT ANYBODY.

1681
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
AND HER LOVE AND THE STRENGTH

1682
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
THAT SHE GAVE US AND THE EXAMPLE

1683
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
THAT SHE SHOWED TO US IS

1684
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
REMARKABLE.

1685
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON.

1686
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
AND I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER
DAD.

1687
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I WAS LEAVING TO WORK AND SHE

1688
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT.

1689
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
AND I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TEACHING

1690
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
HER PORTUGUESE.

1691
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
SO OUR LAST CONVERSATION WAS IN

1692
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
PORTUGUESE.

1693
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
AND SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING.

1694
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

1695
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I SAID THAT I WAS DOING WELL.

1696
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME.

1697
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT

1698
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
THE DOOR.

1699
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
FREE AGENCY IS GIVEN TO ALL OF

1700
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
US TO ACT AND DO WHAT WE WANT.

1701
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM

1702
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
US.

1703
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

1704
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
THAT HE WAS GIVEN AND THAT'S

1705
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
WHAT HE CHOSE TO DO WITH IT.

1706
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I KNOW THAT GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT

1707
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
AWAY.

1708
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I'M NOT MAD BECAUSE I HAVE MY

1709
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
AGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT I USE

1710
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
THIS EVENT TO DO WHAT I CAN TO

1711
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,000
DO WHATEVER I CAN.

1712
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
DO WHATEVER I CAN.

1713
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY

1714
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
FAMILY AND MY WIFE AND MY

1715
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
DAUGHTERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF AND

1716
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
THAT IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I

1717
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
CAN DO TO HELP ANYBODY AT ANY

1718
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
TIME, ANYWHERE, I'D BE WILLING

1719
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
TO DO THAT.

1720
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT HAPPENED

1721
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO SO MANY
