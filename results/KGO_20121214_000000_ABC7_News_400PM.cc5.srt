WHY?

778
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
BECAUSE YOU PAID ATTENTION TO

779
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000

>> BECAUSE YOU ACTED LIKE A MAD

780
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000

00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
WITH iPad OR ANDROID.

1076
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
IT'S MAUL AND LIGHT WITH

A TYPICAL LAPTOP.

1079
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
IT RUNS ON TRIPLE-A BATTERIES.

1080
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
>> THE DOWN SIDE IS THAT IT

1081
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
DOESN'T ACT AS A CASE OR A

1082
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000

EVACUATED AS THICK, BLACK SMOKE

1278
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
AND FEROCIOUS FLAMES RACED OUT

1279
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
OF THE COMPLEX.

1280
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
THIS IS HOW THE MAJOR FIRE

1281
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
LOOKED AT ITS PEAK THIS

1289
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT ROOF.

1290
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
THE BUILDING HERE WAS COMPLETELY

1291
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
ENGHUFLED WITH FLAMES AND, OF

1292
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
COURSE, THEY WERE RIGHT, THE

1293
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
ROOF DID EVENTUALLY COLLAPSE.

1294
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
WHEN THE FIRE BEGAN, THERE WERE

1295
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
