1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
BUT WILLIAMS IS

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
NOT CHOOSING JUNK FOOD,
SHE WANTS TO FEED HER FAMILY

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
HEALTHY MEALS, THAT'S WHY

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
SHE HAS CANNED AND FROZEN
VEGETABLES IN HER CART.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A MOVE THAT DIETICIAN
PENNY WILSON SAYS IS SMART.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
YOU CAN SAVE MONEY AND EAT

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
WELL AT THE SAME TIME.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
TIP NUMBER ONE.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
TO SAVE ON FOOD, CHOOSE
FROZEN OVER FRESH, ITS

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
USUALLY CHEAPER.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
BECAUSE THE FROZEN VEGETABLES

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
ARE PICKED AT THE PEAK OF
RIPENESS AND FROZEN RIGHT THEN.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE BROCCOLI,
WE FOUND IT FOR 2.18 FRESH,

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
BUT IN THE FROZEN FOOD SECTION

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
BROCCOLI CUTS COST $1 A BAG

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
FOR ABOUT THE SAME SIZE
AS THE FRESH BUNCH.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
AND YOU DON'T HAVE

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
TO WORRY ABOUT
THEM GOING BAD.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
TIP NUMBER TWO GO
FOR CANNED VEGGIES.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
WE GREW UP ON CANNED

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
VEGETABLES, THAT'S ALL
WE HAD IN MY HOUSE.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
WILSON SAYS WHILE FRESH
PRODUCE IS ALWAYS A GREAT OPTION

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
SHE SAYS CANNED VEGETABLES

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
ARE A GOOD SUBSTITUTE.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
JUST READ THE LABELS.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
STILL 10% ONE THING YOU WANT TO

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
LOOK FOR IS IF YOU CAN GET

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
THE ONES WITH NO ADDED SALT.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
BECAUSE THEY DO TEND

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
TO ADD SALT INTO
CANNED VEGETABLES.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
TIP NUMBER THREE BEANS

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
ARE A SUPER FOOD.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T
REALIZE BEANS ARE A GOOD

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
SOURCE OF PROTEIN AND FIBER.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
SHE SAYS CANNED BEANS ARE
A GREAT OPTION BUT TO SAVE EVEN

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
MORE PICK UP SOME DRIED BEANS.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
YEAH, YOU'RE GOING TO GET

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
MORE OVERALL WITH THAT.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
TIP NUMBER FOUR BUY YOUR

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
GRAINS FROM THE BULK FOOD
CONTAINERS LIKE OATS OR

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
BROWN RICE, WILSON SAYS

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
YOU WILL SAVE A BUNDLE,

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
FOR EXAMPLE WE PICKED UP

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
A POUND OF STEEL CUT OATS OF

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
1.29 VS 4.69 FOR A POUND AND
A HALF WE FOUND ON THE SHELF.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
FINALLY PICK SUPER FOODS

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000

PRETTY SPIRITUAL, BUT ONE OF

172
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Meredith: THEN LET'S PLAY.

364
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
ANGRY OVER THEIR GOVERNMENT'S

365
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
FINANCE POLICIES, IN 2011,

366
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
PROTESTERS IN WHAT COUNTRY

367
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
STARTED HURLING YOGURT AT

368
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
POLICE? PORTUGAL, IRELAND,

369
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
ITALY, GREECE.

370
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
>> THE COUNTRY THAT HAS THE

371
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
WORST FINANCIAL SHAPE OF THE 4

372
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
IS GREECE, WITHOUT A DOUBT.

373
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
IRELAND'S IN NOT GREAT SHAPE,

374
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
EITHER.

375
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
IT KIND OF APPLIES TO EVERY

376
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
COUNTRY NOW.

377
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
TO ME GREECE SEEMS THE COUNTRY

378
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
IN THE WORST SHAPE. THEY'RE IN

379
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
CONTINUAL--BUT HURLING YOGURT.

380
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
THE BANK IS 50...

381
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Meredith: HAVE 52,000 IN THE

382
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
BANK. YOU STILL HAVE A JUMP. IF

383
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
YOU THINK YOU KNOW THIS, GO FOR

384
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
IT. MISS IT, THOUGH, YOU LOSE

385
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
YOUR BANK.

386
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
>> GREECE IS THE COUNTRY THAT'S

387
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
IN THE WORST FINANCIAL SHAPE OF

388
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
ALL OF THEM. IT'S CONTINUALLY

389
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
IN DEFAULT. "D," GREECE.

390
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Meredith: FINAL?

391
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
>> FINAL ANSWER.

392
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Meredith: YOU KNOW, YOU GO INTO

393
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
ANY SUPERMARKET NOW, AND YOU'RE

394
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
GONNA FIND SO MUCH GREEK

395
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
YOGURT, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. IT

396
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
IS GREECE. IT'S ALL OVER THE

397
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
PLACE. IT'S THE HOTTEST YOGURT

398
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
RIGHT NOW. AND YOU ARE

399
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. ALL RIGHT,

400
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
LET'S SEE HOW MUCH MONEY IS

401
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
BEHIND THIS.

402
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
$500. OHH. OK. DOESN'T MATTER.

403
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
3 AWAY FROM ROUND TWO. AT THAT

404
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
POINT, YOU GET TO KEEP ALL THE

405
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
MONEY IN YOUR BANK. $52,500.

406
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
10,000 IS STILL UP THERE.

407
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
"TAKING MEASUREMENTS." A

408
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
MARIGRAPH IS A DEVICE THAT

409
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
MEASURES WHAT?

410
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
LAVA TEMPERATURES, CLOUD

411
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
SPEEDS, TIDE LEVELS, TREE

412
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
CIRCUMFERENCES. A MARIGRAPH.

413
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
STILL HAVE A LIFELINE IF YOU

414
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
NEED IT.
>> I'M REALLY GLAD I SAVED THAT

415
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
JUMP. MARIGRAPH.

416
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
MARI...MARITIME? MARITIME IS

417
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
OCEAN. TIDE LEVELS.

418
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
CLOUD SPEEDS. THAT'S JUST WIND.

419
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
TREE CIRCUMFERENCES. THAT'S A

420
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
RULER. LAVA TEMPERATURES?

421
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
THAT'S A THERMOMETER. TIDE

422
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
LEVELS. MARIGRAPH. MARIGRAPH.

423
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
YOU KNOW WHAT?

424
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
[SIGH]

425
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I CAN TALK MYSELF INTO ALMOST

426
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
ANY ANSWER, BUT I'M NOT GONNA

427
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
BE ABLE TO TALK MYSELF INTO

428
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT A

429
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
MARIGRAPH IS. OBVIOUSLY I'M

430
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
LEANING TOWARDS ONE. IT'S

431
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
PROBABLY GONNA GLOW GREEN, BUT

432
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'M GONNA HAVE TO JUMP THIS

433
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
QUESTION.

434
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Meredith: OK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO

435
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
ANSWER THE QUESTION. LET'S SEE
THE RIGHT ANSWER. YOU WERE

436
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
RIGHT. IT WAS TIDE LEVELS.

437
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
LET'S HOPE THAT THERE'S NOT

438
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
10,000 BEHIND THIS QUESTION.

439
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
SHOW US THE MONEY, PLEASE,

440
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
COMPUTER. OH. GOOD. YOU LOSE

441
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
100, BUT YOU JUMP OVER A

442
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
QUESTION, MEANING YOU'RE NOW

443
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
JUST 6 AWAY FROM A MILLION, TWO

444
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
AWAY FROM ROUND TWO, WHEN YOU

445
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
GET TO KEEP ALL YOUR MONEY.

446
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
"DEEP SECRET" IS THE CATEGORY.

447
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
FOR MANY YEARS, WHICH OF THESE

448
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
TV JOURNALISTS WAS SUSPECTED OF

449
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
BEING THE WATERGATE INFORMANT

450
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
KNOWN AS "DEEP THROAT"?

451
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
BARBARA WALTERS, DAN RATHER,

452
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
DIANE SAWYER, TED KOPPEL.

453
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
>> WELL, IT WAS COMMONLY KNOWN

454
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
THAT DEEP THROAT--WELL, AT

455
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
LEAST IN THE MOVIE--WAS A GUY.

456
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
SO THAT PUTS US TO DAN RATHER

457
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
OR TED KOPPEL.

458
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
[SIGH]

459
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Meredith: YOU HAVE 52,500. IF

460
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
YOU CHOOSE TO WALK, YOU COULD

461
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
WALK WITH $26,250. GET THIS

462
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
RIGHT, IT COULD BE WORTH AS

463
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
MUCH AS 10,000 TO YOU, BUT IF

464
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
YOU MISS IT, ONCE AGAIN, YOU

465
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
LOSE THE BANK.

466
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
>> I'M THINKING IT'S DAN RATHER.

467
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
BUT I CAN'T RULE OUT TED

468
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
KOPPEL. IT'S A BIG GAMBLE.

469
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
BUT I CAME TO PLAY. "B," DAN

470
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
RATHER.

471
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Meredith: FINAL ANSWER?

472
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
>> MEREDITH, I'M AFRAID--YOU

473
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
KNOW, I CAN'T COMMIT TO THAT. I

474
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
WANT TO. I REALLY DO. I'M

475
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
AFRAID I'M GONNA HAVE TO WALK.

476
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Meredith: IS THAT A FINAL, RYAN?

477
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
>> THAT IS A FINAL.

478
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Meredith: YEAH, I'M REALLY GLAD

479
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
YOU DID. THE PERSON WORKED IN

480
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION. IT

481
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
WAS DIANE SAWYER. THAT WAS THE

482
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
ONE THAT PEOPLE SUSPECTED.

483
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
YOU'RE WALKING WITH $26,250.

484
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
GOOD JOB. YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

485
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE
"MILLIONAIRE" RIGHT AFTER THIS.

486
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Meredith: HERE'S YOUR
MILLIONAIRE QUESTION OF THE DAY.

487
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
WHICH OF THESE TOURIST

488
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
ATTRACTIONS IS

489
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
NOT PROFILED IN THE 2003 BEST

490
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
SELLER "1,000 PLACES TO SEE

491
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
BEFORE YOU DIE"? STAY TUNED FOR

492
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
THE ANSWER, WHEN WE COME BACK.

493
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Meredith: WELCOME BACK. THE

494
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
ANSWER TO THE MILLIONAIRE

495
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
QUESTION OF THE DAY IS

496
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
GATEWAY ARCH.

497
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
WE ARE ALMOST OUT OF TIME, SO

498
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
INSTEAD OF STARTING A NEW GAME,

499
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
WE'RE GONNA GIVE ONE OF OUR

500
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
AUDIENCE MEMBERS A SHOT AT

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
WINNING $1,000.

502
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

503
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
AND TODAY'S LUCKY AUDIENCE

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
HEY! BOBBY, HOW ARE YOU--MMM!

MEET YOU.

509
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
>> YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

510
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Meredith: OH, THANK YOU. H

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Meredith: YEAH? TELL US ABOUT
YOU.

514
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
>> WELL, I HAVE 3 DAUGHTERS. I

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
HAVE A WONDERFUL WIFE, WHO'S UP

GRANDKIDS--I'M VERY PROUD OF

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
THEM. THEY'RE ALL DOING GREAT.

519
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
AND IT'S VERY EXCITING TO BE IN

520
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
PITTSBURGH--ER, IN NEW YORK.

521
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
WE'RE FROM PITTSBURGH, BUT

522
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
IT'S EXCITING TO BE HERE.

523
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Meredith: YOU ARE IN NEW YORK.

524
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
YOU'RE ON THE STAGE, ON THE SET

525
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
OF "MILLIONAIRE."

526
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
>> WONDERFUL.

527
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Meredith: AND HOPEFULLY YOU'RE

528
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
ABOUT TO WIN A THOUSAND

529
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
DOLLARS. OK? DOES THAT SOUND

530
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
GOOD?

531
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
>> WITH 5 GRANDKIDS, I CAN USE
IT.

532
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Meredith: OK. LET ME TELL YOU

533
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK. YOU

534
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
ARE GONNA FACE THE NEXT

535
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
QUESTION THAT RYAN WOULD HAVE

536
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
FACED HAD HE NOT WALKED AWAY,

537
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
AND YOU GET IT RIGHT, AND AS I

538
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
SAID, YOU'RE GONNA WIN A

542
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Meredith: AUDIENCE, ARE YOU
