OH, I DIDN'T MEAN--

335
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'VE GOT HALF AN HOUR.
LET'S DO THIS.
WE'LL TALK LATER.

336
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
YEAH. RIGHT.

337
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
LOOK AT YOUR CALENDAR.

338
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
(laughs) OKAY.

339
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
HI.
HI.

340
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
YOU KNOW, ABOUT THIS MORNING,

341
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
WE SHOULD, UH,
WE SHOULD PROBABLY TALK.

342
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
WE SHOULD, ABSOLUTELY.

343
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
LATER.

344
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
RIGHT? OKAY.

345
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
HEY.

346
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
HEY.
I COULD HAVE A JULY BABY.

347
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
THAT'S A GOOD MONTH.
YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER, RIGHT?

348
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
MAYA. SHE'S A FEW YEARS
YOUNGER THAN YOU.

349
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
IT'S THE BEST THING, HUH,
BEING A PARENT?
YEAH, IT IS.

350
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
IT FEELS LTO BE A MOM.

351
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'VE EVER WANTED--TO BE A MOM.

352
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
YOU ARE SO AHEAD OF THE GAME

353
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
TO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
SO CLEARLY AND TO GO FOR IT.

354
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
MOST PEOPLE, THEY PUT IT OFF
OR MAKE EXCUSES.

355
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
MAYBE YOU DON'T GET
THE PERSPECTIVE OF HOW GOOD,

356
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
HOW PRECIOUS LIFE IS
UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE?

357
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
BUT THIS IS THE ONLY LIFE
YOU HAVE, RIGHT?

358
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
YEAH.

359
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
WHOA!
OH!

360
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
OH, MY GOSH. I'M SO SORRY.

361
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
OH, IT'S--NO, IT'S FINE.

362
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
THE BASKET'S OVER THERE
ON THE CART, FOR YOUR CUP.
OH. UH, THANKS.

363
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
UH, ARE YOU JENNA'S HUSBAND?
YEAH, NICK.

364
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'M DR. MONTGOMERY. ADDISON.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

365
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
(woman moaning)

366
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
OH, THE, UH--I COULDN'T
FIGURE OUT HOW TO TURN IT OFF.

367
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
DON'T WORRY. I'VE GOT IT.
(chuckles)

368
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
(moaning continues)

369
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
(moaning stops)

370
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
ARE YOU OKAY?

371
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
YEAH, I'M SORRY. IT'S ALL
JUST A LITTLE... WEIRD.

372
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I MEAN, MOST OF THE TEAM WENT
OUT FOR PIZZA AFTER PRACTICE.

373
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I CAME TO GET JENNA PREGNANT.

374
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
YEAH, YOU SHOULD BE, UH,

375
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
DEALING
WITH COLLEGE APPLICATIONS

376
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
AND MAKING YOUR PARENTS
FREAK OUT OVER WILD PARTIES.

377
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
WELL, I MEAN, PARENTS AREN'T
REALLY IN THE PICTURE.

378
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
UH, LYNN AND GARRY--
JENNA'S PARENTS--

379
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
THEY TOOK ME IN.

380
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
WE'VE BEEN DATING SO LONG, I WAS
ALREADY PART OF THE FAMILY,

381
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
CAN I ASK YOU...

382
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER?

383
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
AFTER?
WHEN I WAS 17, I COULDN'T
HAVE DONE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

384
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
HAVE YOU THOUGHT THIS THROUGH?
ARE YOU GOING TO COLLEGE?

385
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
WELL, UH,
I WANT TO GO TO U-PENN,

386
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
AND MY GUIDANCE COUNSELOR THINKS
I CAN GET A SCHOLARSHIP.

387
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
THAT'S GREAT. SO THEN WILL YOU
BRING THE BABY WITH YOU,

388
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
OR WILL JENNA'S PARENTS
RAISE THE BABY?

389
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I MEAN,
HOW WILL YOU BE INVOLVED?

390
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
WILL YOU FLY HOME WEEKENDS
OR HOLIDAYS?

391
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN SHE'S 10 OR 15

392
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
AND SHE ASKS WHY HER FATHER
DIDN'T RAISE HER?

393
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
WELL, GARRY AND LYNN
WANT TO BE PARENTS AGAIN,

394
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
AND JENNA WANTS A BABY, SO...

395
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
YOU ARE GONNA BE
THE FATHER, NICK.

396
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

397
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
NO, I WON'T CALL BACK AGAIN.

398
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
WE'VE SENT YOU THIS BILL
THREE TIMES,

399
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
AND WE NEED YOU TO PAY IT.

400
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
IT WOULDN'T HAVE HURT
SO MUCH IF YOU DIDN'T TENSE UP.

401
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
SO AFRAID OF NEEDLES.

402
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

403
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
IF YOU TELL ANYONE,
NO CORNFIELD FOR YOU.
OH, THERE WILL BE CORNFIELD.

404
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
HOW'D THE JOOKAY.

405
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
IT'S NOT OUT OF STATE
OR ANYTHING, RIGHT?

406
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I JUST TOOK AN H.I.V. TEST FOR
YOYOU. WHY WOULD I GO ANYWHERE?R

407
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
(elevator bell dings)

408
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
SO...

409
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
IT'S BUSINESS, COOP.

410
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
LET'S FOCUS ON PLEASURE.

411
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
(whispers) CORNFIELD.

412
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
(Naomi) I AM INJECTING
A SINGLE SPERM INTO YOUR EGG.

413
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
SHE'S MAKING YOUR BABY,
SWEETIE.

414
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
(gasps) LOOK AT THAT.
OUR GRANDCHILD.

415
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
NOW OVER THE NEXT 48 HOURS,

416
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
THE CELLS WILL DIVIDE
AND MULTIPLY TO FORM AN EMBRYO.

417
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
THAT'S MY BABY.
UM, TAKE A PICTURE.

418
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
TAKE A PICTURE OF US
FOR THE ALBUM.

419
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
SURE. OKAY, NICK, GET IN THERE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE A DAD.

420
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
NICK?

421
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'M SORRY.

422
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
YOU'VE BEEN SO GOOD TO ME.
YOU ALL HAVE, BUT...
NICKY.

423
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

424
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I DON'T WANT A BABY.

425
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
IS THE PERFECT CHOICE
FOR HOLIDAY GATHERINGS.

426
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
MARTINELLI'S IS NON-ALCOHOLIC,

427
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
FESTIVE LIKE CHAMPAGNE,
AND TASTES GREAT!

428
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
MARTINELLI'S: SINCE 1868.

429
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
ALL RIGHT, WHAT WOULD BE
ON YOUR LIST

430
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
OF THINGS TO DO
BEFORE YOU DIE, COOP?

431
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
AM I DYING? DID YOU GET
MY TEST RESULTS FROM DELL?
NO. WHAT--

432
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
NICK, PLEASE COME OUT.
I REALLY WANT THIS BABY.

433
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
(Nick)
WE'VE BARELY HAD SEX.

434
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
BABIES ARE SUPPOSED TO COME
FROM SEX.

435
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
(Jenna)
MY PARENTS CAN HEAR YOU.
(Garry) IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

436
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
NICK, I MEAN IT.
YOU PROMISED.

437
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
THIS IS PERFECTLY NORMAL.
IT'S FERTILITY STRESS.

438
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
(Pete) I GOT THE KEY.

439
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
NICK? I'M COMING IN.

440
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
OKAY.

441
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU WANTED THIS.

442
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
YOU WANTED THIS.
THEY WANTED THIS.

443
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
BUT LIKE SHE SAID...

444
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
WHAT ABOUT WHAT I WANT?

445
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
FINE. GO.

446
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

447
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'M SORRY,

448
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
BUT WE CAN'T USE HIS SPERM
WITHOUT HIS CONSENT.

449
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
THAT FERTILIZED EGG
CAN'T BE IMPLANTED.

450
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

451
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
NO, I NEED THIS BABY.

452
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

453
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
COME ON. LET'S GO SIT DOWN.

454
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
(exhales deeply)

455
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
NO, YOU DIDN'T APPROVE
OF WHAT WE WERE DOING,

456
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
AND SO YOU SABOTAGED IT.
HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO.
I WAS BEING A GOOD DOCTOR.

457
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
DO YOU WANT TO PICK UP
THE PIECES OF THAT GIRL NOW?

458
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I TOLD YOU TO BACK OFF.

459
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I COULD USE YOU
ON MY CA

460
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
CONSULTANT
FOR MY HEALTH CARE POLICY--

461
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
AFFORDABLE COVERAGE
FOR EVERYONE,

462
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH.
I HAVE HEARD
YOUR STUMP SPEECH.

463
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
THAT IS NOT
WHY I ASKED TO SEE YOU.

464
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
WELL, IT MAY BE A STUMP SPEECH,
BUT I BELIEVE IN IT.

465
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER, VI.
WHICH IS WHY I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD HIDE FROM YOUR PAST.

466
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'M NOT HIDING.
YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE
TO DO GOOD,

467
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
TO EMBRACE WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU, TO GO PUBLIC.

468
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
IS THAT WHAT YOU DID?

469
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
WELL, THAT'S DIFFERENT.

470
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
IS IT? THIS IS SOMETHING FROM
MY PAST I WANT KEPT PERSONAL.

471
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

472
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
NEITHER IS RAPE,

473
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
BUT YOU CHOSE TO BURY IT.

474
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
AND I HELD YOUR HAND
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

475
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I KNOW.

476
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I KNOW YOU WERE THERE
FOR ME.

477
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
BUT BURYING THIS...
IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU.

478
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
HIDING A SECRET,
WALKING AROUND WORRIED ABOUT

479
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
WHEN THE OTHER SHOE IS GONNA
DROP, IT'S GONNA EAT YOU UP.

480
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
AND I AM NOT TALKING
ABOUT KARA WEI,

481
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
THE CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE.

482
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'M TALKING ABOUT KARA,
MY FRIEND.
YOU CAN STOP IT NOW, VIOLET.

483
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
WHEN--WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,
AND YOUR MOTHER HAD JUST DIED

484
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
AND YOU DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT
AND YOU BURIED IT,

485
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
IT ALMOST DI

486
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
UNTIL YOU OPENED UP TO ME,

487
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
AND THEN YOU GOT HELP.

488
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
AND THEN I OPENED UP TO YOU
AND I LEARNED THE SAME LESSON.

489
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
THIS IS DIFFERENT.
NO, NO, IT'S NOT.

490
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
YOU ARE ABOUT TO BE
IN A POSITION OF POWER.

491
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
THINK HOW MANY PEOPLE
YOU COULD HELP

492
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
IF THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS OKAY
TO TALK ABOUT--

493
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I HAVE PLENTY OF PEOPLE I HELP.

494
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
HELL, I'M SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE
WHO WANT MY HELP.
I--

495
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I CAME TO YOU BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD HELP ME.

496
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I THOUGHT WE DID THAT
FOR EACH OTHER.

497
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
HEY, DID YOU GET MY PATIENTS'
BLOOD WORK BACK FROM THE LAB?

498
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
UH, NOT TILL TOMORROW.
THESE ARE RAPID BLOOD TESTS!

499
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE
BEFORE I DIE, SAM?
