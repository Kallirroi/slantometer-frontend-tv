ON STAGE IS A LITTLE

560
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000

HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.

562
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
AND HE'S DRAWING ONLY IRE AND

1434
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
AND FROM CAPITOL HILL TO THE

1435
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
WHITE HOUSE FROM HOUSE SPEAKER

1436
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
JOHN BOEHNER AND PRESIDENT OBAMA

1437
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
TRIED TO FIND SOME COMMON GROUND

1438
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
IN FISCAL CLIFF NEGOTIATIONS

1439
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
LAST NIGHT.

1440
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
WAS THERE PROGRESS OF ANY SORTS?

1441
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
WE'RE GOING TO TELL YOU.

1442
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
>> WE'RE COVERING EVERY LITTLE

1443
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
INCH OF THE BACK AND FORTH.

1444
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
AT LEAST AT THIS POINT, NOTHING

1445
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
CONCRETE.

1446
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
AGAIN, THE BIG ISSUE IS WHAT IS

1447
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
BEING TALKED ABOUT PRIVATELY,
NOT PUBLICLY.

1448
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
WE'LL SEE IF THEY HAVE SOMETHING

1449
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000

THE CLOCK IS TICKING.

1450
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
>>> ALSO, FROM A LEGAL DEBATE TO

1451
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
A HEALTH ISSUE.

1452
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
WHAT DOCTORS ARE SAYING ABOUT

1453
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
THE BENEFITS OF SAME-SEX

1454
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
MARRIAGE.

1455
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
THEY STUDIED HOW COUPLES FEEL

1456
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
AFTER MAKING THEIR RELATIONSHIPS

1457
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,000
LEGAL.

1458
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
>>> AND LATER, ODD BALL UPSCALE

1459
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
AND ONE OF A KIND.

1460
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
THE HOT NEW WEBSITE OFFERING

1461

DON'T GO TO THAT WEBSITE YET.

1466
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
>> WHY NOT?

1467
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
>> BECAUSE THEN THEY WON'T WATCH

1468
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
THE SHOW.

1469
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000

VERY PROLONGED, VERY

1509
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
POLITICIZED, VERY DISTRACTING,

1510
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
AND VERY DISRUPTIVE.

1511
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS

1512
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
WE NEED TO GET DONE AS A

1562
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
THAT MEANS THE FEDS WILL COME IN

1563
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
AND DO IT FOR THEM.

1564
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
17 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF

EIGHT STATES WANT A PARTNERSHIP

1567
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
TO GET THIS DONE AND SIX HAVE

MADE NO DECISION AND WILL HAVE

HAVE YET TO OFFICIALLY DECIDE.

1571
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
BUT TODAY IS THE DEADLINE DAY.

1572
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

1573
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
>> BUT IT DOESN'T GO INTO EFFECT

1574
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
UNTIL 2014, BUT THEY HAVE TO

1575
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
MAKE THIS DECISION.

1576
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
IF THEY DON'T DECIDE, AND THEY

1577
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
HAVE TO BY LAW, IF THEY DON'T,

ALL OF THIS FELL ON PARTY LINES.

1593
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
SO IF YOU LIVE IN A RED STATE,

1594
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
MOST LIKELY YOUR STATE

1595
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
GOVERNMENT SAID NO, LET THE FEDS

1596
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000

FIVE STATES DID BREAK PARTY

01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
IOWA, MISSISSIPPI, IDAHO, NEW

1599
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
MEXICO AND NEVADA ALL BROKE

1600
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
PARTY LINES TO GET IT DONE.

1601
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
SO TODAY'S DECISION DAY AND IT'S

1602
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
A BIG COMPONENT.

1603
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
SO THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS.

01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
WE'LL SEE WHERE IT STANDS.

1605
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000

1616
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
GOOD MORNING, PAULA.

1617
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
MORE SIGNS THAT THEY'RE NO

1618
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
CLOSER TO A DEAL TO THE FISCAL
CLIFF.

1619
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
BUT AT LEAST YESTERDAY,
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HOUSE

SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER SAT DOWN
AND TALKED.

1621
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER PAID

1622
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
A VISIT TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A

1623
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
NEARLY HOUR-LONG MEETING WITH

1624
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

1625
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
IT WAS THEIR SECOND FACE-TO-FACE

1626
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
SESSION IN THE PAST FIVE DAYS.

1627
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED IF HE'S

1628
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
FEELING OPTIMISTIC.

1629
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
>> IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS.

1630
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
>> Reporter: VERY MUCH IN

1631
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
PROGRESS.

1632
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
RIGHT NOW THERE'S EVEN

1633
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
DISAGREEMENT ON WHAT THEY'RE

1634
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
DISAGREEING ABOUT.

1635
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
IS IT TAX RATES FOR THE WEALTHY?

1636
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
>> THERE ARE SOME CLEAR, YOU

1637
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,000
KNOW, RED LINES WHEN IT COMES TO

1638
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
HOW WE BUILD A BROADER DEFICIT

1639
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
REDUCTION PACKAGE.

1640
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
>> Reporter: OR IS IT SPENDING

1641
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
CUTS?

1642
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
>> IT'S CLEAR THE PRESIDENT IS

1643
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
NOT SERIOUS ABOUT CUTTING

1644
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
SPENDING, BUT SPENDING IS THE

1645
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
PROBLEM.

1646
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
>> Reporter: IN TEN MINUTES,

1647
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
BOEHNER HAMMERED HOME THAT POINT

1648
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
NEARLY TWO DOZEN TIMES AND

1649
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
SIGNALED THERE MAY BE ROOM FOR

1650
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
FLEXIBILITY.

1651
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
>> IF THE PRESIDENT WILL SHOW US

1652
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
HE'S WILLING TO MAKE THE

1653
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
SPENDING CUTS NEEDED, I THINK WE

1654
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
CAN DO SOME REAL GOOD IN THE

1655
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
DAYS AHEAD.

1656
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000

PLACE MORE PESSIMISTIC THAN

SPEAKER BOEHNER HAS WARNED HIS

01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
BE READY TO STAY HERE THROUGH

1661
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
CHRISTMAS AND MAYBE NEW YEAR'S.

1662
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
ROB AND PAULA, BACK TO YOU.

1663
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000

ABOUT 100 GUARDS SAY THEY WILL

THEY'RE UPSET OVER EQUIPMENT AND

THE REMAINS WERE RELEASED TO HER

THEY FLEW HER HOME FROM MEXICO

1682
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
ON A CHARTERED JET.

1683
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
SHE DIED SUNDAY WHEN HER PLANE

1684
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
CRASHED INTO A MOUNTAIN IN

1685
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
MEXICO AND NEARLY DISINTEGRATED.

1686
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
TWO POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN

1687
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF

1688
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
STEALING FROM THE CRASH SITE AND

PRESIDENT ASSAD IS LOSING HIS

1693
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
COUNTRY'S BLOODY CIVIL WAR AND

1694

NOW THE FOREIGN MINISTRY DENIES

1695
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
THAT STATEMENT THIS MORNING.
THE REBELS ARE OUTSIDE THE

CAPITAL AND GAINING GROUND, BUT

MANY GROUPS WITH COMPETING

1698

INTERESTS AMONG THE RANKS AND

1699
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
ASSAD'S FALL WOULD NOT MEAN AN

1700
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
END TO THE FIGHTING.

1701
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000

TO THE EXTENT THAT EXTERNAL

1704
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
ORGANIZATIONS ARE IN THERE IN
SOME EXTREMIST FORM, THE WORRY

1705
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:03,000
IS THE RETRIBUTION AFTERWARDS

1706
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
AND ACCESS TO CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

1707
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
>> THIS WEEK, THE U.S., EUROPE

01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000

QAEDA.

1713
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
THAT IS THE LINGERING QUESTION,

1714
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
YOU KNOCK OUT THE LEADER, BUT

WHAT IS LEFT, BUILDING A NEW

THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET.

1727
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
BUT THIS WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT
THEY CAME OUT AND SAID THIS.

1729

IF YOU LIKE WHAT YOU JUST SAW,

1979

>> REALLY?

1980
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000

IT'S NOT GOING TO BE REFLECTED

1985
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
UNTIL YOU PUT IT IN YOUR CART.

1986
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
>> UNDERSTOOD.

1987
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
>> PUT THE JUNK IN THE TRUNK.

1988
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
>> THERE ARE FINALLY SOME PERKS

1989

FINALLY SOME PERKS

1991
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:00,000
TO WATCHING OUR SHOW.
WE'LL BE BACK.

1992
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:37,000
>>> TIME FOR OUR FRIDAY MORNING

1993
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
EDITION OF "INSOMNIAC THEATER."

1994
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
>> WITH A PAIR OF MOVIES VERY

1995
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER, "THE

1996
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
HOBBIT" OPENS THIS WEEKEND, BUT

1997
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
LET'S LOOK AT "STAND UP GUYS"

1998
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
ABOUT A TRIO OF VETERAN

1999
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
GANGSTERS.

2000
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
I LIKE THE PLOT OF THIS ONE.

2001
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
IT STARS SOME HEAVYWEIGHTS.

2002
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
AL PACINO'S CHARACTER GETS OUT

2003
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,000
OF PRISON AFTER 30 YEARS.

2004
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
HE GETS PICKED UP IN JAIL BY HIS

2005
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
BEST FRIEND, DOC PLAYED BY

2006
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
CHRISTOPHER WALKEN.

2007
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
TEAM UP WITH ANOTHER ONE OF

2008
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,000
THEIR BUDDIES.

2009
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
ONE OF THE THREE DUDES HERE IS

2010
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
KEEPING A DANGEROUS SECRET

2011
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
LINKED TO A FORMER MOB BOSS.

2012
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
THAT'S WHERE THE DRAMA ENSUES

2013
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
HERE.

2014
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,000
GREAT CAST.

2015
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

2016
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
>> REMEMBER ME?

2017
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
I DO THIS, HUH?

2018
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
>> WHAT TIME IS IT?

2019
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2020
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:38,000
WHAT TIME IS IT?

2021
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
>> IT'S TIME TO KICK ASS OR CHEW

2022
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,000
GUM.

2023
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
AND GUESS WHAT?

2024
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I'M ALL OUT OF GUM.

2025
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
>> RAW TOMATO FOLKS DO NOT

2026
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
AGREE.

2027
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
ONLY GETTING 50% THUMBS UP RIGHT

2028
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
NOW.
SO THAT'S NOT TOO GREAT, BUT

2029
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
THIS LINE SUMMED UP BEST.

2030
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
THE FILM IS CLEVER IN THE WAY IT

2031
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
DEALS WITH THE HIGH COST OF MOB

2032
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
CONNECTIONS AND THE HIGHER COST

2033
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
OF OLD AGE.

2034
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
GREAT CAST.

2035
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
CHECK IT OUT.

2036
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
>> NOW TO ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY

2037
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
ANTICIPATED MOVIES OF THE YEAR,

2038
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:11,000
"THE HOBBIT."

2039
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
WHAT SETS THIS FILM APART, 48

2040
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,000
FRAMES PER SECOND.

2041
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
IT'S A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR SOME

2042
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
PEOPLE.

2043
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
BUT THIS IS A PREQUEL TO THE

2044
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
ORIGINAL TRILOGY.

2045
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,000
HE HAS TO RECLAIM THE LOST DWARF

2046
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
KINGDOM AND, FIRST, HE HAS TO

2047
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
ESCAPE THE GOBLIN TUNNELS.

2048
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
MEETS THE CREATURE.

2049
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,000
THAT WILL CHANGE HIS LIFE

2050
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:35,000
FOREVER.
TAKE A LISTEN.

2051
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
>> SO I'M A HUGE FAN OF THE

2052
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
SERIES.

2053
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,000
ROTTEN TOMATO ONLY GIVING IT 69%

2054
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
APPROVAL.

2055
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
AND ONLY 461 THEATERS OUT OF

2056
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:09,000
4,000 ARE GOING TO SHOW THE

2057
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
EXPEDITED VERSION OF THE 48
FRAMES PER SECOND.

2058
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
IT MAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE

2059
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
NAUSEOUS.

2060
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:17,000

OF TIME BEFORE PRESIDENT ASSAD

>> Reporter: BUT WHO EXACTLY ARE

2154
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
THESE REBELS?

2155
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
>> WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD SENSE.

2156
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,000
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT EXTERNAL

2157
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
ORGANIZATIONS ARE IN THERE AND

2158
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
IN SOME EXTREMIST FORM, THE

2159
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
WORRY IS BOTH THE RETRIBUTION

2160
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
AFTERWARDS AND THE POTENTIAL

2161
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
ACCESS TO CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

2162
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
>> Reporter: A THREAT TO AMERICA

2163
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
AND THE WORLD AND A THREAT TO
THE PEOPLE OF SYRIA LONGING TO

2164
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:52,000
BE FREE OF VIOLENCE.

2165
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
OFFICIALS I'VE SPOKEN TO FEAR

2166
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
THIS COULD BE A LONG AND BLOODY

2167
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
CONFLICT.

2168
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
EVEN IF ASSAD FALLS.

2169
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
THOUGH SOME STILL HOLD OUT HOPE
A POLITICAL SOLUTION CAN BE

2170
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
FOUND, IF ASSAD FINALLY REALIZES
HIS DAYS ARE NUMBERED.

2171
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
MARTHA RADDATZ, ABC NEWS,

2172
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
WASHINGTON.
>> THANK YOU, MARTHA.

2173
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
>>> U.N. AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE

2174
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
IS STEPPING ASIDE, WITHDRAWING

2175
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,000
HER NAME FROM CONSIDERATION TO

2176
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
BECOME THE NEXT SECRETARY OF

2177
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
STATE FOR THE U.S.

2178
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,000
IN A LETTER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA,

2179
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
RICE SAID THE CONFIRMATION

2180
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
PROCESS WOULD BE LENGTHY,

2181
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
DISRUPTIVE, AND COSTLY.

2182
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
SHE SAYS IN THE END, THE

2183
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
TRADEOFF WOULD BE UNFAIR TO THE

2184
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
COUNTRY.

2185
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
REPUBLICAN SENATORS HAVE
ATTACKED RICE FOR HER HANDLING

2186
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
OF THE CRISIS IN LIBYA AND THE

2187
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
DEATH OF AMBASSADOR CHRIS

2188
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
STEPHENS.
SO A LITTLE BIT OF A POLITICAL

2189
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,000
BLACK EYE FOR THE OBAMA

2190
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
ADMINISTRATION.

2191
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,000
THIS WAS HIS FIRST CHOICE, NOW

2192
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
LOOKING LIKE SENATOR JOHN KERRY

2193
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
OF MASSACHUSETTS WILL BE THE

2194
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:44,000
LIKELY AT THIS POINT.

2195
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
>> AND SUSAN RICE TWEETING

2196
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
YESTERDAY, THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW

2197
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
ME KNOW I'M A FIGHTER, BUT NOT

2198
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
AT THE COST OF WHAT'S RIGHT FOR

2199
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
OUR COUNTRY.

2200
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
SHE JUST WROTE AN OP-ED IN "THE

2201
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
WASHINGTON POST" AND SAID I

2202
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
CONCLUDED IT WOULD BE WRONG TO
ALLOW THIS DEBATE TO KEEP

2203
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
DISTRACTING FROM URGENT

2204
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
NATIONAL PRIORITIES LIKE

2205
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,000
IMMIGRATION AND GROWING OUR

2206
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,000
ECONOMY.
>> BENGHAZI WAS AN ISSUE.

2207
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,000
BUT ALSO SOME OF HER DECISIONS

2208
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,000
AND DIPLOMATIC SKILLS HAVE

2209
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
BECOME AN ISSUE, AS WELL.

2210
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
SOME FINANCIAL TIES SHE HAD.

2211
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,000
SOME INVESTMENTS SHE HAD BECAME

2212
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
AN ISSUE.

2213
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
SO IT WAS MORE THAN THE BENGHAZI

2214
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
ISSUE.

2215
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
THAL WAS THE CORE ISSUE HERE.

2216
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
BUT OBAMA IS LIKELY TO NAME HER

2217
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
AS HIS NEXT NATIONAL SECURITY

2218
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,000
ADVISER, A JOB WITH LESS

2219
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
PRESTIGE BUT IN SOME CASES EVEN

2220
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
MORE INFLUENCE THAN THE

2221
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
SECRETARY OF STATE.

2222
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
SO BY NO MEANS IS SHE OFF THE

2223
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,000
SCENE BY ANY STRETCH.

2224
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
SO SHE'LL STILL BE HEAVILY

2225
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,000
INVOLVED IN THE ADMINISTRATION.
>>> MOVING ON THIS MORNING.

2226
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
SLOW PROGRESS IN WASHINGTON AS

2227
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
THE NATION CREEPS CLOSER TO THE

2228
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
FISCAL CLIFF JUST 18 DAYS AWAY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HOUSE

2229
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER MET AT THE

2230
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
WHITE HOUSE FOR LESS THAN AN

2231
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
HOUR THURSDAY.

2232
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
SPOKESMEN ON BOTH SIDES SAID THE

2233
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
TWO HAD A FRANK DISCUSSION,

2234
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
THEIR FIRST FACE-TO-FACE SINCE

2235
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
SUNDAY.

2236
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
WITHOUT A DECISION, MANDATORY

2237
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
TAX HIKES AND BUDGET CUTS WILL

2238
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
TAKE EFFECT AT THE START OF THE

2239
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
YEAR.

2240
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
THIS SEEMS LIKE WE'RE NOT

2241
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000
GETTING ANY MAJOR HEADWAY, JUST

2242
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
BABY STEPS.

2243
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
>> THEY SAY THE LINES OF

2244
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,000
COMMUNICATION ARE OPEN, BUT ONLY

2245
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
UNDER MY RULES.

2246
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S WHAT I'M

2247
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
GETTING FROM BOTH SIDES.

2248
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
BUT 50 MINUTES AT THE WHITE

2249
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
HOUSE.

2250
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
SO HOPEFULLY THEY CAN GET IT

2251
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
DONE.

2252
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:18,000
>> I GUESS I STEP BACK AND SAY,

2253
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
LET'S SAY WE GET TO SOMETHING BY

2254
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
THE END OF THE YEAR.

2255
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
YOU HOPE THAT WHATEVER

2256
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
COMPROMISE THEY COME UP WITH IT

2257
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
DOES ACHIEVE A GREATER GOOD FOR

2258
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
THE COUNTRY.
WHATEVER THE FINAL NUMBERS, YOU

2259
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
HOPE THAT PEOPLE DON'T JUST SIT

2260
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
AROUND AND APPLAUD THAT WE GOT A
COMPROMISE IF IT DOESN'T

2261
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
ACCOMPLISH MUCH IN GETTING THE

2262
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
NATION'S FISCAL HOUSE IN ORDER.

2263
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
SO IT'S GREAT WE GOT A
COMPROMISE BUT WHAT DO YOU

2264
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
REALLY ACCOMPLISH?

2265
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,000
FISCAL HEALTH OF THE COUNTRY.

2266
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,000
>> IT WOULD BE DISHEARTENING IF
THAT WERE THE CASE, IF IT

2267
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
WEREN'T FOR THE BETTERMENT OF

2268
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,000
THE COUNTRY.

2269
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,000
>>> IN THE WINDY CITY, A YOUNG
MAN TRYING TO TAKE A PICTURE OF

2270
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
THE CHICAGO SKYLINE FELL TO HIS

2271
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000

WHEN HE WENT UP A LADDER TO THE

01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,000
TOP OF THAT SMOKESTACK AND LOST

2276
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
HIS FOOTING.

2277
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
IT TOOK FIRST RESPONDERS FOUR

2278
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
HOURS TO CUT THROUGH THE STEEL

2279
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT TO REACH

2280
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
HIM, BUT THEY WERE TOO LATE.

BURIED IN JUNK.

2294
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,000
NOT A MOTHER OF THE YEAR AWARD.

2305
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
THE RESTAURANT IS VOLUNTARILY

CLOSING ITS DOORS FOR 24 HOURS

2307
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
SO IT CAN BE CLEANED AND

2308
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,000
DISINFECTED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.

2309
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000

MONTHS.

2317

INSENSITIVE.
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.

SAID OH, IT'S A TERRIBLE CLIP.
