1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
>> I'LL BET HE DID.
>> AND SLEEP OVER IN A GHOST

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
TOWN, HE SAID.
>> NOW WE'RE GETTING THERE.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
>> BUT I WAS SUCH A NICE JEWISH

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
GIRL, THAT I SAID, MARLON, I

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
CAN'T STAY OVERFLIGHT WITH YOU.
I I WILL GO WITH YOU FOR THE DAY

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE ME HOME.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
>> SO MARLON CLEARLY WANTED TO

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
DO MORE THAN SEE THE FLOWERS

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
WITH YOU.
>> HE WANTED TO SLEEP IN THE

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
DESERT WITH ME.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
>> YOU TURNED DOWN MARLON

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
BRANDO?
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
>> HOW DID HE TAKE REJECTION?

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
>> IT WAS FINE.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
>> A REMARKABLE CONVERSATION

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
WITH A REMARKABLE LADY.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
AC 360 STARTS NOW.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
>>> GOOD EVENING EVERYONE.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
IT IS 10:00 ON THE EAST COAST.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
THE WOMAN BELIEVED TO BE

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CHOICE FOR

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS NO

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
THANKS.
U.N. BAM BASS DAR SUSAN RICE.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
SHE WAS THE ONE CAUGHT UP IN THE

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
CONTROVERSY OF HER STATEMENTS

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
AFTER THE MURDER OF FOUR

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
AMERICANS IN LIBYA.

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
YOU WILL RECALL THE PRESIDENT

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
STOOD UP FOR HER USING BLUNT

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
LANGUAGE SAYING ANYONE WHO HAS A

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
PROBLEM WITH HER HAS A PROBLEM

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
WITH HIM.
INSTEAD THERE WON'T BE C

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
CONFRONTATION BECAUSE AMBASSADOR
RICE TOOK HERSELF OUT OF

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
CONTENTION WRITING THE PRESIDENT

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
SHE IS HONERRED TO BE CONSIDERED

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
FOR THE OFFICE SAYING, I AM NOW

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
CONVINCED THAT THE CON PIR

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
FASHION PROCESS WOULD BE

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
LENGTHY, DISRUPTIVE AND COSTLY

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
AND THAT TRADE-OFF IS SIMPLY NOT

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
WORTH IT TO OUR COUNTRY.

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
>> TODAY I MADE THE DECISION

48
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
THAT IT WAS THE BEST THING FOR

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
OUR COUNTRY, FOR THE AMERICAN

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
PEOPLE, THAT I FN CONTINUE TO BE

51
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
CRED BY THE PRESIDENT FOR

52
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
NOMINATION OF SECRETARY OF STATE

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE A

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
CONFIRMATION PROCESS THAT WAS

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
VERY PROLONGED, VERY

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
POLITICIZED, VERY DISTRACTING,

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
AND VERY DISRUPTIVE BECAUSE

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WE NEED

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
TO GET DONE AS A COUNTRY AND THE

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
FIRST SEVERAL MONTHS OF THE

61
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
PRESIDENT'S AGENDA IS REALLY THE

62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE CRUCIAL

63
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THINGS DONE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

64
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
REFORM, BALANCED DEFICIT

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
REDUCTION, JOB CREATION.

67
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS EP.

68
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
AND TO THE EXTENT MY NOMINATION

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
COULD HAVE DELAYED, DISTRACTED

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
0R DEFLECTED PRIORITIES
IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE I DIDN'T

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
WANT THAT AND I WOULD MUCH

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
PREFER TO CONTINUE DOING WHAT

73
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'M DOING, WHICH IS A JOB I LOVE

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
AT THE UNITED NATIONS.

75
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ACCEPTED HER

76
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
DECISION TO BOW OUT CALLING HER

77
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
AN EXTRAORDINARILY PATRIOTIC

78
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
PERSON.
WITH MORE ON WHO LED UP TO THAT

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
DECISION, DANA, WHAT WAS THE

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR ALL OF THIS

81
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
FOR AMBASSADOR RICE?

82
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
>> FIRST OF ALL WITH HER CHIEF

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
FOES, SENATORS, McCAIN, GRAHAM

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
AND AYOTE.
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY A

85
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
REPUBLICAN WHO HADN'T QUITE MADE

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
UP HER MIND.

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
THAT THE MODERATE REPUBLICAN

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
FROM MAINE, SUSAN COLLINS.

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
BY ALL ACCOUNTS THAT MEETING DID

90
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
NOT GO WELL AT ALL ACCORDING TO

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
A SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH THAT

92
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
MEETING.
SHE REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO ANSWER

93
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
REALLY BASIC QUESTIONS AND GOT

94
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
FRUSTRATED AND MAYBE EVEN A

95
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
LITTLE PRICKLY AT SOME OF THE

96
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
BASIC QUESTIONS AND AFTER THAT,

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THE FEELING, EVEN AMONG

98
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
DEMOCRATS WHO TALKED TO
REPUBLICANS IS THEY WEREN'T SURE

99
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
IF SHE CAN'T HANDLE MEETINGS

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
WITH U.S. SENATORS, HOW IS SHE

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
GOING TO BE ON THE WORLD STAGE

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
REPRESENTING THE U.S. THERE.

103
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
SO THAT DEFINITELY WAS AN ISSUE.

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
PRESIDENT IN HIS STATEMENT MADE

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
CLEAR THAT HE DIDN'T THINK SUSAN

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
RICE WAS TREATED FAIRLY.

108
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS THAT

109
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
POLITICS WERE AT PLAY HERE.

110
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
SHE ILLUSTRATED THAT.

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
BUT IT WAS MORE THAN THAT.

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
ALSO PERSONALITY DRIVEN.

113
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
EVEN DEMOCRATS THINK SHE IS VERY

114
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
SMART, VERY CAPABLE BUT DOESN'T

115
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
HAVE THE RIGHT PERSONALITY FOR

116
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
THIS JOB.

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
>> GLORIA, EARLIER I HEARD YOU

118
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
SAY THAT AMBASSADOR RICE WAS

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
PROBABLY UNDERESTIMATED BY THE

120
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
CLUB.
WHAT DID YOU MEAN FROM THAT?

121
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
>> THAT WAS FROM A DEMOCRAT

122
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE WHO
SAYS THE CLUB IS REALLY

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
IMPORTANT ON CAPITOL HILL.

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
JOHN KERRY IS THE LEADER IN THAT

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
CLUB.
JOHN McCAIN LIKES HIM AN AWFUL

126
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
LOT AND WOULD CLEARLY GO ALONG

127
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
WITH THAT NOMINATION.

128
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
ALSO WHEN SHE TRAVELED UP THERE,

129
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
AND SHE WANTED TO GO UP THERE TO

130
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
TALK TO THESE SENATORS, THERE IS

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
A SENSE FROM THE SOURCE THAT SHE

132
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
OVERHER ABILITY TO WOO THEM

133
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
OVER.

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
THAT WAS A BIG PREEXISTING

135
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
CONDITION FOR HER.

136
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
AS DANA JUST POINTED OUT, SHE

137
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
DIDN'T WIN OVER SUSAN COLLINS

138
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
WHO WAS QUITE IMPORTANT TO HER.

139
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
>> DAVID, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

140
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
THIS?

141
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
IS THIS JUST A SIGN OF HOW

142
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
PARTISAN THINGS HAVE BECOME OR

143
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
WAS IT PRETTY CLEAR FROM AS SOON

144
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
AS THE CONTROVERSY OVER

145
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
BENGHAZI, THE COMMENTS BEGAN

146
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN?

147
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
>> I DON'T THINK THIS IS JUST

148
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
ABOUT PARTISANSHIP.

149
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
AND I DON'T THINK IT IS JUST

150
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
GOOD BENGHAZI.

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
THAT WAS AN ISSUE OF COURSE.

152
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
BUT IN THIS CASE, THERE ARE A

153
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
NUMBER OF SENATORS ON BOTH SIDES

154
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
TO THE AISLE THAT BELIEVE THE

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
UNITED STATES HAS TOUGH WORK

156
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
AHEAD IN INTERNATIONAL

157
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
RELATIONS.
SOMEONE HAS TO NEGOTIATE WITH

158
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
THE IRANIANS TO MAKE SURE WE

159
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
DON'T GET INTO A CONFLICT THERE

160
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
AND SBHN A TOUGHNESS AND

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
AUTHORITY OF A JIM BAKER AND

162
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
FRANKLY, THERE WAS A SENSE ABOUT

163
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
SUSAN RICE THAT EVEN THOUGH SHE

164
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
IS VERY TALENTED AND I THINK SHE

165
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
DID A GENEROUS THING TODAY BY

166
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
WITHDRAWING, SHE REALLY WAS

167
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
LOYAL TO HER PRESIDENT BY HIM

168
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
DOING THAT.

169
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
BUT THERE WAS ALSO A SENSE THAT

170
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE WEIGHT.

171
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE BACKGROUND

172
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
THAT SENATOR KERRY DOES.

173
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
AND HE IS EXTREMELY SCHOOLED AND

174
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
KNOWS THE ROUGH PARTS OF THE

175
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
WORLD.
THERE WAS A SENSE IN THE SENATE

176
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
THAT PEOPLE THERE WOULD JUST BE

177
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
MORE COMFORTABLE WITH HIM

178
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
REPRESENTING THE UNITED STATES.

179
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
>> DAVID, WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS

180
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
SAYS ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA

181
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
HIMSELF.

182
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
IT SEEMS LIKE, ESPECIALLY IN THE

183
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
LAST MONTH OR SO, THAT HE WAS

184
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
DIGGING IN HIS HEELS PREPARING

185
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
FOR A FIGHT.

186
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
>> WELL, IT DID SEEM LIKE THAT.

187
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000

188
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS REPORTS

189
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
THAT HE'S BEEN AGONIZING OVER

190
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
THIS CHOICE AND IN A SENSE SHE

191
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
LET HIM OFF AND RECOGNIZESING A

192
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
KNEE AND REMOVED IT.

193
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
AND I -- BUT I THINK ONE CAN

194
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
READ INTO THIS, THAT HE DOESN'T

195
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000

196
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000

197
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000

198
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000

199
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000

200
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
STRUGGLE TOO MANY WHEN HE WANTS

201
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
IT GET HIS SECOND TERM OFF AND

202
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
RUNNING AND HE DOESN'T WANT TO

203
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
BE ENSNARED LIKE THIS.

204
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
IT HAPPENS TO PRESIDENTS AND AS

205
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
WE HAVE HAD REALLY GOOD PEOPLE

206
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
WHO HAVE NOT MADE IT THROUGH

207
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THIS PROCESS.

208
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I REMEMBER SO WELL THE ICONIC

209
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
FIGURE TED SORNSEN NAMED CHIEF

210
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
AND IT WAS DEAD AFTER A TIME.

211
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
TED SORENSON WENT ON TO GREAT

212
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
THINGS, BUT THIS WILL BE ALWAYS

213
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
BE A TOUGH CHAPTER IN HIS LIFE.

214
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
>> YOU SAID THE SENATE WAS

215
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
COMFORTABLE WITH JOHN KERRY.
I THINK IN A WAY THE SENATE

216
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE COMFORTABLE

217
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
WITH SUSAN RICE.
IT IS NOT THAT HE DOESN'T LIKE

218
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
JOHN KERRY.

219
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
JOHN KERRY HELPED HIM OUT DURING

220
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000

HE'S KNOWN HIM FOR A LONG TIME.

221
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
SUSAN RICE IS A DEAR OLD FRIEND

222
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
AND THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE HERE

223
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
WHICH IS THE QUESTION OF

224
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
DIVERSITY.
BECAUSE FF IT SORT OF ALL STACKS

225
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
UP AS WE THINK IT'S GOING, IT

226
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
LOOKS LIKE THE TOP FOUR CABINET

POSTS CAN NOW POTENTIALLY BE

228
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
FILLED BY MEN AND I'M SURE THAT

229
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE WHITE

230
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000

231
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
>> THIS TEAM THAT LOOKS TO BE

ABOUT REPUBLICANS FOR DEFENSE,

234
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000

235
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
LIKE A TEAM THAT CAN MAKE IT

236
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
THROUGH CONFIRMATION INTO SENATE

237
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
IF JOHN KERRY IS ALSO INVOLVED?

238
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
>> IT DOES.

239
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000

FOR EXAMPLE, TOM DASCHLE,

CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT MEMBER

243
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
OF THE CLUB, THE SENATE CLUB.

244
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
HE DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH
BECAUSE THERE WAS A SURPRISE

245

ISSUE WITH HIS TAX RETURNS FOUR

246

WITH REGARD IT JOHN KERRY, EVEN

THE REPUBLICAN LEADER LATE TODAY

249
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
SAID KIND WORDS ABOUT HIM.

250
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
IT IS VIRTUALLY SURE THAT HE IS

251
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
GOING TO GET THROUGH THE SENATE

252
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN VETTED IN

253
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
MANY WAYS BECAUSE HE WAS THE

254
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000

HE IS SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T HAVE
THE CLOSEST RELATIONSHIPS HERE

259
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
BUT THE FACT THAT IT WOULD BE A

260
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
BIPARTISAN PICK BECAUSE HE IS A

261
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000

LIKELY.

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
OUR GOAL TONIGHT IS JUST REAL

365
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
REPORTING, AS IT IS EVERY NIGHT,

366
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
FINDING THE TRUTH AND CALLING

367
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
OUT HYPOCRISY.

368
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
TONIGHT THE STAKES ARE LIFE AND

369
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
DEATH.
EVERY YEAR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS

370
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
THAT PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE

371
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
FOR OUR COUNTRY PUT THEMSELVES
IN HOSPITALS.

372
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
TENS OF MILLIONS GET TREATMENT

373
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
IN VIRGINIA CLINICS AND DESERVE

374
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE.

375
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
CERTAINLY NONE SHOULD EXPECT A

376
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
TRIP TO THE HOSPITAL MIGHT MAKE

377
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
THEM SICK OR KILL THEM.

378
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
ONE PITTSBURGH AREA FAMILY SAID

379
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO

380
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
THEIR DAD AND THERE COULD BE

381
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
MORE CASES LIKE HIS.

382
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
HE WAS TREATED IN PITTSBURGH'S
VA SYSTEM, ONE OF THE MOST

383
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
HIGHLY REGARDED IN THE NATION

384
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
AND MAY HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF
WHAT HE CAUGHT THERE,

385
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE, AN

386
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
INFECTION THAT SPREADS IN

387
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
CONTAMINATED WATER SUPPLIES.

388
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
WHAT MAKES THIS STORY EVEN MORE

389
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
TROUBLING IS THE EVIDENCE CNN

390
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
HAS UNCOVERED.

391
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
IT SHOWS THAT HOSPITAL OFFICIALS

392
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
KNEW ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND YET

393
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
APPARENTLY THEY FAILED TO FIX

394
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
IT.

395
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
SINCE JANUARY OF LAST YEAR, LAST

396
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
YEAR, THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST

397
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
FIVE CASES DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO

398
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
THE VA HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN

399
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
PITTSBURGH, BUT ONLY LAST MONTH

400
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
DID THE VA ADMIT THEY HAD A

401
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
PROBLEM WITH THEIR WATER SUPPLY.

402
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
THEY SAID SO IN A NEWS RELEASE

403
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
AND ISSUED TWO MORE, INCLUDING

404
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
ONE THAT SAID THE PROBLEM HAS

405
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
BEEN SOLVED.

406
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
APART FROM NEWS RELEASES,

407
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
THOUGH, THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT

408
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
TALKING.

409
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
HOWEVER, DREW GRIFFIN IS
INVESTIGATING.

410
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
>> HE FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THE

411
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
VA WAS GOING TO GIVE HIM THE

412
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
BEST CARE THEY COULD POSSIBLY

413
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
GIVE HIM.

414
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
>> KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW NOW,

415
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
DID THE VA GIVE HIM THE BEST
CARE POSSIBLE?

416
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
>> NO.
NO, THEY DIDN'T.

417
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I MEAN I CAN SAY THERE WAS

418
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
STRONG NEGLIGENCE ON THE VA'S

419
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
PART.

420
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
>> BOB NICHOLAS IS TALKING ABOUT

421
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
HIS FATHER, BILL.

422
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
A WORLD WAR II NAVY HERO, WHO

423
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
WOULD DROP INTO HOSTILE WATERS

424
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
TO SAVE DOWNED NAVY PILOTS.

425
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
BUT BILL NICHOLAS DIED THE DAY

426
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
AFTER THANKSGIVING FROM HEART

427
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
FAILURE AND LEGIONNAIRE'S

428
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
DISEASE.

429
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
HE CONTRACTED IT FROM USING THE

430
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
WATER AT THE VA, WHICH WAS

431
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
CONTAMINATED WITH HIGH LEVELS OF

432
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
A BACTERIA, THE CAUSE OF

433
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE.

434
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
TWO OTHER FAMILIES ARE WONDERING

435
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
WHETHER THEIR VETERANS

436
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
CONTRACTED THE LEGIONNAIRE'S

437
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
DISEASE THAT KILLED THEM FROM

438
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
THIS SAME PITTSBURGH VA.

439
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
CNN HAS NOW LEARNED THAT

440
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
HOSPITAL OFFICIALS KNEW THEY HAD

441
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
A PROBLEM WITH THE WATER SYSTEM

442
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
AS FAR BACK AS DECEMBER OF LAST

443
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
YEAR, BUT CHOSE NOT TO REVEAL

444
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
ANY OF THAT PUBLICLY UNTIL A

445
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
MONTH AGO.

446
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
>> BEING A VETERAN MYSELF, I'M

447
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
SHOCKED AND APPALLED THAT THE VA

448
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
WOULD PUT THEIR VETERANS IN THAT

449
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
TYPE OF SITUATION.

450
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
>> RECORDS OBTAINED BY CNN SHOW

451
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
THAT OVER THE PAST YEAR, THE

452
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
AMOUNT OF DISINFECTANT IN THE

453
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
VA'S WATER WAS LESS THAN THE

454
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
AMOUNT NEEDED TO PREVENT THE

455
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
BACTERIA FROM REACHING DANGEROUS

456
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
LEVELS, AND INTERNAL RECORDS

457
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
FROM A WATER QUALITY COMPANY

458
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
CALLED LIQUITECH SHOW THAT IN

459
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
DECEMBER OF 2011, AN INSPECTION

460
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
SHOW THEY HAVE LEGIONELA,

461
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
SYSTEMS NOT BEING PROPERLY

462
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
MAINTAINED.
FIVE MONTHS LATER THE PROBLEMS

463
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
CONTINUED.

464
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
OBVIOUS EVIDENCE THAT THE

465
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
SYSTEMS HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY,

466
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
REGULARLY MAINTAINED.

467
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
LIQUITECH IS THE CONTRACTOR WHO

468
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
INSTALLED THE VA'S WATER SYSTEM,

469
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
AND A SYSTEM LIKE IT IN HUNDREDS

470
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
OF OTHER HOSPITALS ACROSS THE

471
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
COUNTRY.

472
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
HE SAYS IT IS INEXPLICABLE THAT

473
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
THE VA HOSPITAL IN PITTSBURGH

474
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
KNEW IT HAD A PROBLEM, WAS

475
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
WARNED ABOUT IT AND DID NOT FIX
IT.

476
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
>> THEY WERE NOT CLEANING THE

477
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
FLOW CELLS, NOT DOING THE

478
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
MONITORING, NOT DOING THE THINGS

479
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
NECESSARY FOR THE EFFICACY OF

480
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
THE SYSTEM.
>> DID YOU TELL THE HOSPITAL?

481
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
>> YES, WE DID.

482
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
YES, WE DID.

483
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
WE TOLD THEM -- WE ACTUALLY HAD

484
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
TWO AUDITS AND TOLD THEM TWICE

485
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
THAT THEY WERE DEFICIENT IN

486
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
THEIR MAINTENANCE.

487
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
>> WHAT IS SO FRUSTRATING IS IF
THE SYSTEM HAD JUST BEEN

488
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
MAINTAINED, IF THE HOSPITAL HAD

489
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
JUST LISTENED AND MADE SIMPLE

490
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
ADJUSTMENTS, HE SAYS HE BELIEVES

491
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED.

492
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

493
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
ABSOLUTELY.

494
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
>> 100%?
>> 100%.

495
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
>> AS IS DONE IN ALL THE OTHER

496
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
HOSPITALS THAT YOU SERVICE?

497
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
>> YES.

498
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
>> THIS OUTBREAK WAS ABSOLUTELY

499
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
PREVENTIBLE.

500
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
>> DR. JANET STOUT WITH HER

501
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
COLLEAGUE, DR. VICTOR YU WORKED
FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS AT THIS

502
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
SAME PITTSBURGH VA HOSPITAL

503
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
RESEARCHING LEGIONNAIRE'S

504
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
DISEASE.

505
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
THEY WERE PIONEERS IN THE FIELD,

506
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
DEVELOPING THE COPPER SILVER

507
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
IONIZATION FILTRATION SYSTEM

508
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
WHICH IS STILL BEING USED AS

509
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
PITTSBURGH'S VA AND IN HOSPITALS

510
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
NATIONWIDE.

511
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
SIX YEARS AGO IN A CONTROVERSIAL

512
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
MOVE, THE DOCTORS AND THEIR

513
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
LEGIONELLA RESEARCH LAB WERE

514
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
TOLD BY THE VA THAT THEIR

515
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
SERVICES WERE NOT PRODUCTIVE AND

516
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
A DRAIN ON CLINICAL RESOURCES.

517
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
THE DOCTORS SAY FOR A DECADE

518
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
BEFORE THEY LEFT, NOT A SINGLE

519
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
PATIENT GOT LEGIONNAIRE'S FROM

520
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
THE HOSPITAL'S WATER.

521
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
SHE SAYS IF SHE WERE STILL THERE

522
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
MONITORING THE WATER, THIS

523
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
ENTIRE TRAGEDY WOULD HAVE BEEN

524
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
PREVENTED WITH THE TURN OF A

525
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
KNOB.

526
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
>> SO THIS IS NOT, AS THEY SAY,

527
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
ROCKET SCIENCE.

528
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
THIS IS STRAIGHTFORWARD.

529
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
>> SO WHAT WENT WRONG?

530
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
OUR CALLS AND E-MAILS TO THE VA

531
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
WENT UNANSWERED, SO KEEPING THEM

OF GETTING ANSWERS.
WE WERE MET BY FOUR ARMED

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
FEDERAL OFFICERS.

537
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000

00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
DREW GRIFFIN WITH CNN.

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
THIS IS THE REASON WHY.

915
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
YOU CAN'T PREDICT
WHEN BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN,

916
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
SO HELP PROTECT YOURSELF
WITH ADT.

917
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
ISN'T YOUR FAMILY WORTH

918
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
AMERICA'S NUMBER-ONE
SECURITY COMPANY?

919
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
CALL AND GET ADT INSTALLED

920
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000

>>> HER DEATH SHOCKED THE WORLD,

925
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
NOW BRITISH POLICE ARE RELEASING

926
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE NURSE

927
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
WHO TOOK HER OWN LIFE AFTER

928
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
TRANSFERRING A CALL TO THE WARD

929
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
TREATING PRINCESS CATHERINE.

930
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT THE

931
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING HER

932
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
DEATH NEXT.

933
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
>>> A MOTHER WHOSE YOUNG

934
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
CHILDREN WERE VICIOUSLY STABBED

935
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
TO DEATH IS REELING TONIGHT.

936
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
THEIR KILLER IS BACK ON THE
STREETS.

937
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
HE WAS RELEASED FROM A MENTAL

938
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
HEALTH FACILITY JUST YESTERDAY.

939
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
THE CASE IS AS CONTROVERSIAL AS

940
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
IT IS HORRIFYING.

941
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
5-YEAR-OLD OLIVIER AND HIS

942
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
3-YEAR-OLD SISTER WERE STABBED

943
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
TO DEATH IN THEIR OWN BEDS.

944
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
EACH CHILD HAD OVER A DOZEN

945
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
WOUNDS.

946
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
AS HORRIBLE AS THOSE FACTS ALONE

947
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
ARE, THE REST IS WORSE.

948
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
THEIR FATHER, A PHYSICIAN, IS

949
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
THE ONE WHO KILLED THEM AND HE

950
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
CONFESSED.

951
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
BUT A CANADIAN JURY RULED THAT

952
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
HE WASN'T CRIMINALLY RESPONSIBLE

953
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
BECAUSE OF HIS MENTAL STATE AT

954
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
THE TIME.

955
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
INSTEAD OF PRISON, HE WAS SENT

956
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
TO A MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY.

957
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
NOW HE'S FREE AND HE HAS NO

958
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
CRIMINAL RECORD.

959
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
HIS EX-WIFE, WHO'S ALSO A

960
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
DOCTOR, FOUGHT HARD TO KEEP THAT

961
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
FROM HAPPENING.

962
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000

AUTOPSY REPORTS, SHE WISHES SHE

966
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY MEANT.

967
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
BUT AS A PHYSICIAN AND A

968
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
CORONER, SHE KNOWS IT'S TRUE.

969
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
HER CHILDREN SUFFERED LONG,

970
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
GRUESOME DEATHS.

971
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
>> I KNEW THAT IT WAS NOT A

972
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
SHORT DEATH.

973
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
MY LITTLE BOY RECEIVED 20 -- 20

974
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
STABS OF A KNIFE.

975
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
HE HAD SEVEN MARKS OF DEFENSE.

976
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
HE HAD NO WOUND THAT WAS THE ONE

977
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
THAT GAVE HIM DEATH.

978
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
>> THERE WAS NO MERCY?
>> NO.

979
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
MY LITTLE GIRL HAD 19 WOUNDS.

980
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
MAYBE SHE WAS LUCKIER BECAUSE

981
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
SHE HAD ONE THAT WAS MORE MORTAL

982
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
THAN THE OTHER, BUT SHE FELT THE

983
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
19 SHOTS FOR SURE.

984
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
>> Reporter: BUT THIS WAS NO

985
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
RANDOM ACT OF VIOLENCE.

986
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
THE KNIFE WAS WIELDED BY THE

987
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
CHILDREN'S FATHER AND GASTON'S

>> TO KNOW THAT MY CHILDREN

991
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
FACED THE PERSON THAT THEY

992
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
SHOULD TRUST THE MOST AND THEY

993
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
WERE LEFT BY THEMSELF TO DIE, NO

STRUGGLE, OKAY.

996

I STRUGGLE ALL THE DAY, EVERY

DAY OF MY LIFE, AND UNTIL I DIE

998
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I WILL STRUGGLE.

999
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
>> THE DOCTOR ADMITS HE KILLED

1000
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
HIS CHILDREN IN 2009, AND YET

1001
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
NOW HE IS A FREE MAN, EVEN

1002
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
POSSIBLY FREE TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE AGAIN.

1003
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
IN 2010 A CANADIAN JURY FAILED

1004
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
TO CONVICT HIM OF THE MURDERS,

1005
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
FINDING HIM NOT CRIMINALLY

1006
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
RESPONSIBLE DUE TO MENTAL

1007
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
ILLNESS.

1008
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
HE KILLED HIS CHILDREN ON WHAT

1009
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A FAMILY

1010
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
MOVIE NIGHT.

1011
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
THIS SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWS

1012
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
HIM RENTING VIDEOS WITH HIS

1013
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
CHILDREN JUST HOURS BEFORE HE

1014
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
BRUTALLY STABBED THEM IN HIS

1015
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
BED.

1016
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
THESE WERE TROUBLING TIMES FOR

1017
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
THE DOCTOR.

1018
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
HE WAS SEPARATED FROM HIS WIFE.

1019
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
SHE HAD LEFT HIM FOR ANOTHER
MAN.

1020
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
HE SAID HE SUFFERED A BLACKOUT

1021
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
AND DOES NOT REMEMBER STABBING

1022
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
THE CHILDREN.

1023
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
THE VERDICT IS BEING APPEALED.

1024
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
>> DO YOU BELIEVE HE WAS

1025
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
MENTALLY INSANE WHEN HE

1026
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
COMMITTED THE MURDERS, AND DO

1027
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
YOU BELIEVE HE'S MENTALLY INSANE

1028
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
NOW?
>> NO, NO.

1029
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
>> WHY?

1030
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
>> WHY SHOULD I, THAT I DON'T

1031
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
ACCEPT HE IS MENTALLY ILL, WHEN

1032
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I LOOK AT THE FACTS, OKAY.

1033
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
WE HAVE A PERSON THAT'S A

1034
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
CARDIOLOGIST THAT HAS NEVER HAD

1035
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
A PSYCHIATRIC INCIDENT, NEVER,

1036
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
NOT AT ALL.

1037
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
TESTIMONY OF TWO PSYCHIATRISTS

1039
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
PRESENTED BY THE DEFENSE.

1040
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
THEY TESTIFIED THAT THE DOCTOR

1041
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN WHAT HE WAS

1042
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
DOING WHEN HE REPEATEDLY STABBED

1043
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
5-YEAR-OLD OLIVIER AND

1044
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
3-YEAR-OLD ANN-SOPHIE.

1045
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
>> I'M A LITTLE BIT MAD BECAUSE

I HAVE TO RESPECT THEIR

1047

DECISION, SO IT CONFRONTS ME AND

1048
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
MY VALUES, BUT I THINK THEY
DIDN'T DO THEIR JOB.

THE ONLY CONDITIONS OF HIS

1055
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
RELEASE ARE THAT HE CONTINUE

1056
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
WITH THERAPY AND STAY AWAY FROM

1057
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
HIS EX-WIFE AND HER FAMILY.

1058

REVIEW PANEL THAT RELEASED HIM

1060
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
IN A YEAR.

GAVE TESTIMONY AT HIS TRIAL HAVE

1065
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
TOLD CNN THEY DO NOT WISH TO

COMMENT ON THE CASE.

1067

DR. GASTON SAYS SHE FEARS FOR

1068
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
HER LIFE NOW, AND BELIEVES THE

1069
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
PSYCHIATRISTS THAT TESTIFIED ON

1070
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
HIS BEHALF DID NOT EVALUATE HIM

1071
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
LONG ENOUGH.

1072
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
SHE IS CALLING FOR STRICTER

SHE SAYS SHE HAS NEVER BELIEVED

1076
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
HER EX-HUSBAND WAS MENTALLY ILL,

1077
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
AND EVEN IF HE WAS, HE COULD NOT

1078
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
NOW BE CURED IN LITTLE MORE THAN

1079
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
THREE YEARS.

VICTIMS IN THE FUTURE?

1086

1125
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000

1126
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
TIMES, HE CONFESSED TO IT.

1127
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
HE SERVED 46 MONTHS, NOT ALL OF

1128
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
IT IN PRISON.

1129
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
HE IS A FREE MAN RIGHT NOW.

1130
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
ADD TO THAT THAT THE MENTAL

1132
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
THIS GUY DOES PRESENT A RISK TO

1133
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
SOCIETY.

1134
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
WE DON'T KNOW HOW HE'LL BEHAVE

1135
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
IN THE FUTURE, BUT HE NEEDS TO

1136
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
BE FREE AND WE CAN MANAGE THAT

1137
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000

00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
ANDERSON, I'LL REMIND YOU, THERE
WILL BE NO POLICE OFFICER

1139
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000

1140
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
NOT ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

1141
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
AND THE PUBLIC WANTS TO KNOW
WHY.

1142
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
>> I MEAN THAT'S JUST

1143
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
INCREDIBLE.

1144
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
FOR SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME

1145
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
THAT HE ACTUALLY WAS IN THIS
MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY.

1146
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
WHAT IS NEXT FOR HIM?

1147
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
IN HIS TESTIMONY AS TO WHY HE

1150
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
WANTED TO BE RELEASED, HE SAID

1151
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
HE WANTED TO LEAD A NORMAL LIFE.

1152
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
HE'S GOING TO APPLY AGAIN TO
PRACTICE MEDICINE.

1153
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
HE IS A CARDIOLOGIST, HE DOESN'T

1155

IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF CARE HE

1156

HAD FOR HIS PATIENTS.

1157
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
HE IS FREE TO BE A DOCTOR AGAIN

1158
