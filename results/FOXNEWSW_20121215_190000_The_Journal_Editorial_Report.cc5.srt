00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
>>  WELL, DISTURBING NEW

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
DEVELOPMENTS ARE UNRAVELLING

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
BY THE MINUTE IN THE TRAGIC

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
CONNECTICUT SCHOOL SHOOTING.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
RIGHT NOW THE DEATH TOLL

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
STANDS AT 28.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
27 OF THEM THE VICTIMS.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
SO MANY OF THEM CHILDREN.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
THE OTHER, THE GUNMAN, HELLO

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
EVERYONE, I'M JAMIE COLBY, A

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
BRAND NEW HOUR INSIDE

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
AMERICA'S NEWS ROOM.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
>> Rick: I'M RICK FOLBAUM AND

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
POLICE ARE SAYING THEY HAVE

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
GOOD EVIDENCE TO BEGIN TO

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
EXPLAIN WHY 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
LANZA OPENED FIRE ON INNOCENT

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
CHILDREN AND ON THOSE

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
EDUCATORS AS WELL.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
THE GUNMAN IS SEEN HERE IN A

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
PICTURE TAKEN A NUMBER OF

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
YEARS AGO AND WE'RE NOW

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
LEARNING THAT DESPITE EARLIER

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
REPORTS THAT THIS YOUNG MAN'S

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
MOTHER WORKED AT THE SCHOOL,

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
POLICE ARE NOW SAYING THAT

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
THAT HE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
ESTABLISH ANY CONNECTION

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
BETWEEN THE MOTHER AND THE

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
SCHOOL.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
>> Jamie: SO MANY THINGS
DEVELOPING THIS HOUR.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF NEW

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
INFORMATION.
AT THIS HOUR POLICE SAY

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
THEY'VE NOW IDENTIFIED ALL OF

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
THE VICTIMS IN THE TRAGEDY AS

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
THEY WORKED TIRELESSLY TO COMB

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
THE CRIME SCENE.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
>> WE STILL HAVE MAJOR CRIME

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
DETECTIVES AND NEWTOWN

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
DETECTIVES WORKING AT THE

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
SCENE IN THE SCHOOL.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
THAT'S NOT COMPLETED AND THAT

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
PROBABLY WILL NOT BE COMPLETED

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER DAY AND A

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
HALF TO TWO DAYS AND I'M

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
PUTTING A TIME LIMIT ON IT, IT

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
COULD TAKE LONGER.

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
AS I'VE EXPLAINED IN PREVIOUS

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
PRESS CONFERENCES, WE'VE DONE

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
EVERYTHING WE NEED TO DO TO

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
LITERALLY PEEL BACK THE ONION

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
LAYER BY LAYER AND EXAMINE

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
EVERY CRACK AND CREVICE OF

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
THAT FACILITY AND THAT DOES

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
NOT INCLUDE--

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
OR EXCLUDE, I SHOULD SAY THE

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING.

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING IS

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
ALSO PART OF THE CRIME SCENE

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
EVERY SINGLE VEHICLE IN THAT

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
LOT.
IT'S GOING TO BE PAINSTAKING

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
PROCESS.
OUR INVESTIGATOR AT THE CRIME

68
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
SCENE AND AT THE SCHOOL AND

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
SECONDARILY AT THE SECONDARY

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
CRIME SCENE WE USED WHERE A

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
FEMALE WAS DECEASED, COULD

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
PROVIDE GOOD EVIDENCE IN THIS

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
INVESTIGATION, THAT OUR

74
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
INVESTIGATORS WILL BE ABLE TO

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
USE AND HOPEFULLY PAINTING A

76
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
COMPLETE PICTURE HOW, AND MORE

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
IMPORTANTLY, WHY THIS

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
OCCURRED.

79
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A POINT OF

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
ENTRY.
IT WAS, I CAN TELL YOU IT

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
WAS--
I UNDERSTAND BELIEVED HE WAS

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
NOT VOLUNTARILY LET INTO THE

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
SCHOOL AT ALL, THAT HE FORCED

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
HIS WAY INTO THE SCHOOL, AS

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
FAR AS WE CAN GO ON THAT.

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
NOW TO THE SHOOTING.

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
WE DID A THOROUGH SEARCH OF

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND LOCAL

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
PARTNERS AND EVERYTHING WAS

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
EXAMINED.

91
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
IF WE FOUND ANYONE IN THE

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
WOODS CUTTING WOOD, THEY WOULD

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
BE DETAINED PENDING

94
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
INVESTIGATION.

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
SO, THERE WERE NO OTHER

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
ARRESTS THAT WERE ASSOCIATED

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
WITH THIS INVESTIGATION.

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
>> AWE NOW OUR CORRESPONDENT

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
MOLLY LINE IS LIVE IN NEWTOWN,

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
CONNECTICUT.

101
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I KNOW IT'S A HARD STORY TO

102
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
COVER.
AT THIS HOUR DO YOU HAVE NEW

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THE GUNMAN'S

104
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
MOTHER?

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
>> YES, ACTUALLY, MORE THAN 24

106
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
HOURS HAVE PASSED NOW SINCE

107
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
THIS MASSACRE OCCURRED AND

108
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ARE NOW

109
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
SAYING THAT THE GUNMAN'S

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
MOTHER, NANCY LANZA, WHO WAS

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
SCHOOL.
SO, INFORMATION HAS CHANGED

113
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
AND INITIALLY REPORTED THAT

114
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
SHE HAD SOME SORT OF

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
AFFILIATION, POSSIBLY A

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
TEACHER, POSSIBLY A

117
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER AND THAT

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
RAISES MORE QUESTIONS BECAUSE

119
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
INITIALLY PEOPLE THOUGHT IF

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
SHE HAD A CONNECTION TO THE

121
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
SCHOOL, IT MIGHT EXPLAIN SOME

122
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
OF THE GUNMAN'S ANGER AND WHY

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
HE WENT TO THAT LOCATION.

124
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
TO SEEK SOMEHOW A MOTIVE AND

125
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
NOW, FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ARE

126
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
SAYING THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND

127
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
THERE IS NO CONNECTION AND

128
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THAT REALLY RAISES A LOT MORE

129
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THINGS

130
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
HAPPENED AND WHY THEY

131
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
HAPPENED.

132
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
OTHER INFORMATION HAS CHANGED

133
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
OFF THE COURSE OF THIS
INVESTIGATION.

134
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
MOST NOTABLY, THE NAME OF THE

135
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
SHOOTER WAS INITIALLY REPORTED

136
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
TO BE RYAN LANZA, THE BROTHER

137
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
OF THE SHOOTING AND HE WAS

138
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
TAKE BE INTO CUSTODY AND

139
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
SPEAKING AND COOPERATING WITH

140
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
AUTHORITIES AND RELEASED.

141
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
IT IS BELIEVED THAT ADAM

142
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
LANZA, THE SHOOTER, HAD TAKEN

143
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
RYAN LANZA'S IDENTIFICATION IN

144
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
THE SCHOOL WITH HIM.

145
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
AND EVERY TIME THERE'S A PRESS

146
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
CONFERENCE, WE GET A LITTLE

147
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
MORE INFORMATION AND A LITTLE

148
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
MORE THE PUZZLE ALTHOUGH WE

149
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
MAY NEVER KNOW EXACTLY WHY

150
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
THIS SENSELESS EPISODE

151
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
HAPPENED.

152
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
JAMIE.
>> Jamie: ALTHOUGH AT THE

153
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
POLICE CONFERENCE, THEY DID

154
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
SAY THEY HAVE EFFECTIVE

155
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
EVIDENCE THAT THEY FOUND THAT

156
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
MIGHT EXPLAIN MOTIVE.

157
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
IF YOU CAN EVER EXPLAIN SUCH A

158
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
THING.

159
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF

160
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
INTERVIEWS IN THE LAST 24

161
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
HOURS, MOLLY.

162
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
AND THERE WAS ONE SURVIVOR

163
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
THAT COULD PROVE KEY TO THIS.

164
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ACTUALLY

165
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
HAPPENED DURING THIS TRAGEDY?

166
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
>> YEAH, THE SURVIVE YOU'RE

167
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
TALKING ABOUT WAS A SHOOTING

168
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
VICTIM THAT GOT OUT AND MADE

169
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
IT TO THE HOSPITAL AND IS

170
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
EXPECTED TO RECOVER AND THEY

171
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
SAY THAT WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY

172
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE

173
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
THAT BUILDING WILL BE

174
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
INVALUABLE TO THEM AS THEY TRY

175
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
TO UNROUGHLY THE FACTS AND OF

176
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
COURSE, THEY HAVE SO MANY,

177
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
DOZENS AND DOZENS OF FIRSTHAND

178
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
ACCOUNTS OF PEOPLE INSIDE THE

179
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
SCHOOL WHEN THE SHOOTING

180
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
OCCURRED, THAT HEARD THE

181
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
GUNSHOTS AND WE HAD A CHANCE

182
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
TO SPEAK WITH A LIBRARIAN THAT

183
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
SURVIVED AND HERE IS WHAT SHE

184
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
HAD TO SAY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

185
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
INSIDE.

186
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
>> THE INTERCOM IN THE THE

187
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
OFFICE WENT OFF AS IF THEY

188
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
WERE GOING TO MAKE AN

189
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
ANNOUNCEMENT AND THEN WE HEARD

190
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
SOME SCUFFLING NOISES AND

191
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
STUFF AND I THOUGHT THAT

192
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
SOMEBODY HIT THE BUTTON BY

193
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
MISTAKE AND THEY WERE JUST IN

194
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THE OFFICE AND SO I CALLED

195
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
DOWN THERE AND ONE OF THE

196
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
SECRETARIES ANSWERED THE PHONE

197
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
AND SAID THERE'S A SHOOTING

198
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
AND THEN YOU BECOME AWARE AND

199
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
WE STARTED HEARING THE

200
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000

201
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
LOCKDOWN, TO THE GROUP THAT

202
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000

203
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
ACROSS THE HALL AND TOLD THEM

204
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
TO LOCK DOWN.

205
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
>> AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

206
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
THAT ARE AFFECTED AND ARE PART

207
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
OF THIS INVESTIGATION FROM THE

208
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
CHILDREN TO THE SCHOOL

219
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000

222
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
>> Jamie: IF THEY CAN, SO

223
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
TRAGIC.

228
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
SO MANY HEROIC STAFF MEMBERS

229
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
WHO SACRIFICED THEIR OWN LIVES

230
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
IN THE ATTEMPT TO SAVE THE

231
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
YOUNG KIDS.
THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE

232
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL.

233
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
DAWN HOCHSPRUNG, AND OTHERS

234
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
HID UNDER TABLES ONCE THE

235
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
GUNFIRE BEGAN, THE PRINCIPAL

236
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
RAN STRAIGHT FOR THE GUNMAN

237
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
THAN THAT MOVE ENDED UP

238
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
COSTING HER HER LIFE.

239
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
AND THE HER FRIEND, THE

TO SPEAK ABOUT PRINCIPAL

243
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
HOCHSPRUNG.
>> WE HAD A BOOK FAIR A FEW

244
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
WEEKS AGO AND SHE DRESSED UP

245
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000

248
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
SHE WAS JUST AN AMAZING WOMAN,

249
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
SHE WAS STRONG AND FUN AND THE

250
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
KIDS LOVED HER AND, SHE WAS A

251
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
REALLY WONDERFUL WOMAN, IT'S A

252
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
HUGE LOSS FOR THE TOWN AND FOR

253
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
OUR SCHOOL.

254
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW OUR

255
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
SCHOOL IS GOING TO RECOVER,

256
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
YOU THINK ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND

257
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
SHE'S THE PERSON WHO MOST

258
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
COULD HAVE DONE THAT.
>> ALONG WITH THE PRINCIPAL,

259
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
TWO OTHER STAFF MEMBERS DIED

291
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000

EVERYBODY IN THE SCHOOL IS

296
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
DEAD.

297
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
>> THERE'S NO WORD AND I THINK

298
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
EVERYONE IS IN SHOCK.

299
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
AND MY DAUGHTER AND A COUPLE

300
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000

301
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000

SHOCK AND NO ONE CAN BELIEVE

304
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
WHAT'S GOING ON.
>> THIS TOWN IS 300 YEARS OLD

305
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST

306
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
DAY IN THE HISTORY OF THIS

307
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
TO

308
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
TOWN.

309
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
AND IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT

310
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
ANYTHING LIKE THIS COULD

311
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
HAPPEN.
IT'S A VERY QUIET DOWN, MAYBE

312
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
IT'S TOO QUIET.

313
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
IT'S HORRIBLE THAT SUCH EVIL

314
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
EXISTS IN THE UNITED STATES

315
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000

316
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
PARTICUL

317
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
PARTICULAR, BUT THAT'S THE

318
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
NATURE OF THE WORLD WE LIVE

319
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
IN, I GUESS.

320
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
>> EVIL WITHOUT A DOUBT.

321
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
SO CLOSE TO CHRISTMAS IN THE

322
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
MIDDLE OF HANUKKAH, WE'RE

323
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
HEARING SOME FOLKS IN NEWTOWN

324
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
ARE EVEN TAKING DOWN THEIR

326
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
REPORTERS THEY FEEL GUILTY

327
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
WHILE CELEBRATING ANYTHING,

328
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
>> INVESTIGATORS ARE POURING

329
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
OVER THE SCHOOL INCH BY INCH

330
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
AS WE HEARD JUST A FEW MOMENTS

331
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
AGO, A CLEARER PICTURE IS

332
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
STARTING TO EMERGE AS WELL OF

333
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
THE SHOOTER, AND ADAM LANZA,

334
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
SPEAKING IT VARIOUS MEDIA

336
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
YOUNG MAN AND SOME SAYING IT'S

337
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
A HIDDEN TIME BOMB AND JOINING

338
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
DETECTIVE JOHN BASSA.

340
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
AND FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO

341
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE YOUNG

342
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
MAN, BUT THE CRIME SCENE

ITSELF AND WE HEARD FROM THE

344
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
POLICE LIEUTENANT AT THE TOP

345
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
OF THE HOUR TALKING ABOUT THE

346
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
CRIME SCENE STILL BEING VERY

347
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
ACTIVE.
WE KNOW THAT THE VICTIMS ARE

348
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
STILL INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

349
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
AS FAR AS WE KNOW.

350
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
FIRST OF ALL, WHY MUST THEY BE

351
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
LEFT IN THERE FOR SO LONG AND

352
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
NOT RETURNED TO THEIR LOVED

353
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
ONES AND WHAT'S GOING ON NOW

354
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
AS FAR AS THE COLLECTION OF

355
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
EVIDENCE?

356
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
>> WELL, RIGHT NOW, THEY HAVE

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
TO HAVE TO IDENTIFY SOME OF

359
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
THE VICTIMS.

360
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THEY'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE TO

361
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
BE TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS, NOW, BE

362
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000

364
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
CHILDREN, THEY'RE GOING TO

365
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
NEED TO IDENTIFY THEM FIRST

366
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
BEFORE THEY TAKE THEM OUT TO

367
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE.

368
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
>> Rick: WE'VE ACTUALLY HEARD

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
WITHIN THE LAST HOUR OR SO,

370
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
THAT ALL THE VICTIMS HAVE IN

372
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
THAT'S NEW INFORMATION THAT'S

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
COME OVER RECENTLY, DETECTIVE.

374
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
BUT AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE

375
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
WORK THAT STILL LIES AHEAD FOR

376
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
THE INVESTIGATORS, WHAT DO

377
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
THEY HAVE TO DO?

378
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
>> WELL, I THINK WHAT THEY'RE

379
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
GOING TO TRY TO DO, THEY'RE

380
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
GOING TO TRY TO LOOK FOR A

381
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
MOTIVE.

382
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT WE LOOK

383
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
FOR AND THERE'S ALWAYS A

384
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
MOTIVE.
ALWAYS A MOTIVE, BUT IF THEY

385
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
FIND ONE, IT MAY--

386
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
IF THEY FIND ONE, IT MAY BE

387
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
VERY, VERY DIFFICULT FOR

388
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
ANYONE TO EVEN GRASP OR

389
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
UNDERSTAND, WHAT NEEDS TO

390
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
HAPPEN NOW AND WHAT I REALLY

391
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
OPPOSE THE NOTION OF IS THAT

392
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
PEOPLE WANT TO MOURN AND I

393
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
AGREE WITH THAT.

394
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I HAVE FIVE CHILDREN MYSELF,

395
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE ABLE TO

396
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
TAKE ACTION SO THAT THIS WON'T

397
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
HAPPEN.
THREE OF MY CHILDREN ARE GOING

398
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
TO BE GOING TO ELEMENTARY

399
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
SCHOOL ON MONDAY SO WE NEED TO

400
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
TAKE SOME ACTION AND AS A

401
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
POLICE OFFICER, I CAN TELL YOU

402
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS THESE

403
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
GUN-FREE SCHOOL ZONES, THAT

404
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
NEEDS TO BE REPEALED.

405
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
WE HAVE TO HAVE PROTECTION

406
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
THERE AND WE HAVE TO HAVE THE

407
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
ABILITY FOR TEACHERS AND YOU

408
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
KNOW, PEOPLE ON THE CAMPUSES

409
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
TO BE ABLE TO DEFEND

410
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
THEMSELVES AND TO PROTECT

411
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
THESE YOUNG CHILDREN.

412
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
>> Rick: SO WHAT YOU'RE

413
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
TALKING ABOUT HAVING SOMEONE

414
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
ARMED AND TRAINED INSIDE EVERY

415
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
SCHOOL AROUND THE COUNTRY IN

416
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
THE EVENT OF SOMETHING LIKE

417
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
THIS HAPPENING.
>> I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT

418
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
NECESSARILY HIRING OR HAVING A

419
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
POLICE STATE, BUT TALKING

420
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
ABOUT ALLOWING TEACHERS AND,

421
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
YOU KNOW, OTHER PERSONNEL THAT

422
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
WORK AT THE SCHOOL TO HAVE THE

423
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
ABILITY TO HAVE A WEAPON.

424
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
IF THAT PRINCIPAL, AND I KNOW

425
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
IT'S A VERY TRAGIC INCIDENT,

426
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
BUT IF THAT PRINCIPAL HAD A

427
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
WEAPON.

428
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
THERE HAVE BEEN A CHANCE TO

429
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
SAVE HER OWN LIFE, BUT WE NEED

430
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
TO TAKE THIS NOTION OF, YOU

431
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
KNOW, NOT TAKING ACTION NOW,

432
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE ACTION

433
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
NOW AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT

434
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
THIS AND TAKE ACTION AND DO IT

435
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE

436
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
MASS MURDERS THAT WE'VE HAD,

437
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
AND MOST OF THEM, AND THE OF

438
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
ONES THAT ARE ON TV ALL THE

439
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
TIME.

440
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
THEY HAPPEN IN GUN-FREE ZONES

441
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

442
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
HAVE TO LEARN AND WE HAVE TO

443
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND I

444
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
WANT TO PROTECT MY THREE

445
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
CHILDREN GOING TO ELEMENTARY

446
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
SCHOOL, SO, THAT'S VERY

447
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
IMPORTANT, TOO, SHOULD BE

448
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
IMPORTANT TO EVERYBODY.

449
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
>> DETECTIVE.

450
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE TEACHERS

451
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
AND EDUCATORS ARM THEMSELVES

452
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
WITH AND HAVE THE AMMUNITION

453
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
THAT THIS YOUNG MAN HAD THAT

454
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
ALLOWED HIM TO KILL SO MANY

455
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
PEOPLE IN THREE MINUTES?

456
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
>> SURE, THEY SHOULD.

457
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
THEY SHOULD HAVE ANY

458
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
AMMUNITION THEY COULD WANT.

459
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
THE THING HERE IS, THE BOTTOM

460
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
LINE, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

461
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
AMMUNITION OR WEAPONS, THE

462
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
BOTTOM LINE IS, THEY NEED

463
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
SOMETHING AND IT COULD BE

464
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
ANYTHING, ANY TYPE OF FIREARM,

465
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
TO SAVE THE CHILDREN.

466
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
IF YOU WERE TO GIVE ME A MAJOR

467
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
WAND AND I COULD CHANGE THINGS

468
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I WOULD HAVE THAT PRINCIPAL OR

469
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
SOME OF THE TEACHERS ARMED.

470
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
IT COULD HAVE SAVED MORE OF

471
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
THE STUDENTS AND STAFF THAT

472
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
WERE KILLED.

473
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

474
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
>> Rick: JOHN IS A FORMER NEW

475
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000

477
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT A LOT OF

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE

479
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000

THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS.
HE SAID, QUOTE, OUR HEARTS ARE

STAFF AT BOTH THE WHITE HOUSE

524
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000

00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
USUALLY DO A SATURDAY ADDRESS

527
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000

528
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
G.O.P. HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN
BOEHNER SAID THERE WOULD BE NO

529
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000

THIS DOOR SEEMS UNBEARABLE,

536
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
BUT WE WILL LOCK ARM BECAUSE

537
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
THAT'S HOW AMERICANS RISE

538
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000

539
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000

PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT THE

548
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
COUNTRY DOES NEED TO QUOTE,

549
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTIONS TO

550
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES LIKE

551
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000

ALSO HAVE OUR FLAGS AT HALF

555

STAFF.

556
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
>> Rick: NO PARENTS COULD

557
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
WATCH THESE SCENES WITHOUT

558
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
BEING SHAKEN TO THE CORE.

559
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
AND MANY DESCRIBE HORRIFIC

560
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
SCENES BEFORE THEIR EYES.

561
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
WE'LL SPEAK WITH ONE MOTHER

562
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS INSIDE THE
SCHOOL DURING THE SHOOTING.

So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

595
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

596
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's not real.

597
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

598
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

PARENTS RUSHED TO THE SCENE

642
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
HOPING AND PRAYING THAT THEIR

CHILD WAS ONE OF THE ONES THAT

OUT TO THE OTHER PARENTS?

654
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
HOW ARE YOU DOING.

655
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
>> I'M NOT DOING WELL TODAY.

656
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
YESTERDAY I WAS RUNNING ON

657
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
ADRENALIN, I WAS HAPPY MY

658
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
DAUGHTER WAS ALIVE.

659
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I WAS VERY SAD FOR THE REST OF

660
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
THE FAMILIES AND TODAY, IT

661
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
REALLY HIT ME BAD, REALLY BAD.

662
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
>> I'M SURE IT'S SOMETHING

663
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000

664
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
PARENT AS WELL, THINKS COULD

665
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
NEVER HAPPEN AT THEIR SCHOOL.

666
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

667
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
>> Jamie: DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING

668
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
ABOUT THIS SUSPECT?

669
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
>> I'D NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

670
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I HAVE OLDER CHILDREN, 22 AND

671
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
17 AND THEY NEVER HEARD OF HIM

672
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
EITHER.

673
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
SO I--
AND I DIDN'T KNOW HIS MOTHER

674
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
EITH

675
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
EITHER.
>> HOW IS YOUR CHILD DOING

676
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
TODAY, YOUR DAUGHTER.

677
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
>> SHE'S BEEN DOING WELL AND

678
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
HER COUSIN IS HERE AND THEY'RE

679
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000

680
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
SHE'S UPBEAT AND TRYING TO

681
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
KEEP THINGS NORMAL.

682
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
>> Jamie: WE'RE GOING TO TALK

683
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
TO A PSYCHOLOGIST, YOU DON'T

684
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
HAVE TO HAVE HAD A CHILD AT

685
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
THAT SCHOOL TO TALK ABOUT

686
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

687
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER IN THE

688
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
LAST 24 HOURS.

689
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
>> LAST NIGHT AFTER WE DID

690
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
MANY INTERVIEWS AND IT WAS ALL

691
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
OVER AND WE HUDDLED ON THE

692
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
COUCH AND I SAID TO HER, I

693
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT

694
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

695
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
HAPPENS EVERY DAY, THIS IS A

696
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
RARE OCCURRENCE AND YOU NEED

697
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
TO FEEL SAFE IN YOUR SCHOOL,

698
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
THIS SCHOOL IS GOING TO BE

699
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
SAFE.

700
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
AND THE TEACHERS ARE THERE,

701
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
AND 'CAUSE HER TEACHER, YOU

702
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
KNOW, SAVED HER LIFE BY

703
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
LOCKING THE DOOR AND PUTTING

704
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
THEM IN THE CORNER.

705
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
AND YOU KNOW, NOW, HEARING

706
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
MANY STORIES OF HEROISM BY

707
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
THESE TEACHERS AND ESPECIALLY

708
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
THE ONE THAT WAS KILLED AND

709
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
LOCKED HER KIDS IN THE

710
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
BATHROOM.

711
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
>> AND LINDA, TELL ME ABOUT

712
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
WHAT YOUR DAUGHTER DESCRIBES

713
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
HAVING SEEN AND I KNOW AS SOME

714
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
OF THE CHILDREN LEFT THE

715
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
SCHOOL, THE OFFICERS AND

716
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
AUTHORITIES THAT WERE THERE
TOLD THEM TO DO IT WITH THEIR

717
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
EYES CLOSED.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

718
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
>> WHAT HAS SHE TOLD YOU?

719
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
>> SOPHIA WAS TAKEN, ESCORTED

720
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
BY THE POLICE FROM HER

721
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
CLASSROOM, BUT THEY WENT

722
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
THROUGH A BACK ENTRANCE THAT

723
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
WAS NEAR THE PLAYGROUND SO

724
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
THEY DIDN'T NEED TO GO THROUGH
THE FRONT.

725
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
SHE SAID SHE SAW NOTHING AND

726
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
THEY WALKED ALONG THE

727
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
PLAYGROUND AND THE BASEBALL

728
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
FIELD TO THE FIREHOUSE, AND

729
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
THAT'S WHERE I CAUGHT UP WITH

730
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
HER AS SOON AS SHE GOT TO THE

731
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
FIREHOUSE.

732
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
>> WELL, IT'S A BLESSING THAT

733
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
SHE DID NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE

734
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
MORE THAN SHE ABLE DID, DO YOU

735
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
EXPECT THAT OVER TIME YOU'LL

736
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
NEED TO NOT ONLY GIVE HER THE

737
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
LOVE THAT YOU HAVE AND MOVE

738
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
FORWARD THE BEST YOU CAN, BUT

739
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
DO YOU EXPECT THAT SHE'LL NEED

740
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
MORE FROM YOU, HAVING GONE

741
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
THROUGH THIS?

742
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
>> YEAH, I THINK THAT ONCE SHE

743
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
NEEDS TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL,

744
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
WHICH I THINK WILL BE IN THE

745
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
BEGINNING OF THE NEW YEAR, I

746
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
THINK SHE'S GOING TO START

747
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
FEELING THE EFFECTS MORE.

748
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
RIGHT NOW, SHE'S -- SHE'S

749
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
HAPPY BECAUSE SHE HAS HER
FAMILY AROUND HER, IT'S

750
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
CHRISTMAS TIME.

751
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
BUT I THINK WHEN THE REALITY

752
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
HITS AND SHE HAS TO GO BACK

753
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
THERE, THAT'S WHEN I THINK

754
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEEK

755
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
COUNSELING.

756
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
>> Jamie: SHE'S EIGHT YEARS

757
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
OLD.
HAS SHE LOST ANY OF HER

758
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
FRIENDS AS A RESULT OF THIS?

759
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
DOES SHE KNOW OF ANY CHILDREN

760
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
SHE WAS CLOSE TO OR KNEW THAT

761
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
WERE NOT AS LUCKY AS SHE IS?

762
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
>> MY FEAR IS THAT THE

763
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
SIBLINGS OF THE CHILDREN IN

764
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
HER CLASS OR THE CHILDREN SHE

765
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
HAD IN PAST GRADES, THAT THEY

766
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
MAY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.

767
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I DON'T KNOW THE NAMES.

768
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I TRIED WHEN I WAS IN THE HIRE

769
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
HOUSE TO SCAN THE ROOM AND SEE

770
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
WHO I KNOW AND THE CHILDREN

771
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
THAT I KNOW AND I DID SEE MANY

772
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
OF THEM, BUT I DON'T KNOW

773
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
ABOUT THEIR YOUNGER SIBLINGS

774
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
AND THAT'S WHAT'S BREAKING MY

775
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
HEART.
>> Jamie: AS THIS COMMUNITY

776
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
TRIES TO MOVE FORWARD AS WE'VE

777
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
TRAGICALLY SEEN IN OTHER

778
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
SITUATIONS LIKE AURORA, LIKE

779
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
COLUMBINE, WHAT CAN WE DO TO

780
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
HELP THE FOLKS THERE?

781
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
>> YOU, AS THE AMERICA?

782
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
>> AMERICA.

783
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
WE ALL CARE SO MUCH AND I'M

784
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
SINCERELY ASKING YOU WHAT WE

785
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
CAN DO?

786
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
>> I THINK YOU NEED TO KEEP US

787
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
ALL IN YOUR PRAYERS, EVEN

788
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
THOSE WHOSE BABIES SURVIVED,

789
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
THANK THE LORD AND ESPECIALLY

790
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
THOSE WHO LOST THEIR BABIES.

791
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
AND PERSONALLY, MY FEELING

792
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING

793
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL IN THIS

794
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING

795
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
TOO OFTEN AND IT NEEDS TO

796
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
STOP.

797
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT THE

798
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
PRINCIPAL, WHO WAS QUITE

799
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
HEROIC HERSELF.

800
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
>> YES.

801
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
>> Jamie: HAD RECENTLY

802
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
INSTALLED AND BUMPED UP

803
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
SECURITY AT THE SCHOOL AND DO

804
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
YOU KNOW WHY SHE DID THAT AND

805
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
WERE THE PARENTS INVOLVED?

806
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
>> I DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT IT.

807
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I JUST ALWAYS KNEW YOU NEEDED

808
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
TO BE BUZZED IN YOU NEED TO GO

809
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
INTO THE OFFICE WHICH WAS

810
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM THE FRONT

811
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
DOOR, THEY COULD SEE WHO IS AT

812
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
THE DOOR, YOU HAD TO SIGN IN

813
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
IF YOU WERE A VISITOR, BECAUSE

814
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I VOLUNTEERED AND EVEN IF THEY

815
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
KNEW YOU, YOU HAD TO SIGN IN

816
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
AT THE TIME YOU CAME IN AND AT

817
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
THE TIME YOU LEFT, YOU HAD TO

818
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
SIGN OUT.

819
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
AND THE SECRETARIES IN OFFICE

820
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
LOVED THEIR KIDS, VERY

821
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
PROTECTIVE.

822
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
ONE TIME I DIDN'T SIGN MY

823
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
DAUGHTER OUT WHEN I WAS TAKING

824
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
HER HOME AND I--

825
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I GOT REPRIMANDED FOR THAT AND

826
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
IT NEVER HAPPENED AGAIN.

827
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
OF SO, THEY TOOK THE SECURITY

828
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
OF THE KIDS VERY, VERY

829
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
SERIOUSLY.
>> Jamie: BRENDA LEBINSKI

830
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
WHOSE EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

831
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
WAS IN THIS SCHOOL AND

832
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
EXPERIENCED THE TRAGEDY.

833
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
AS YOU MENTIONED, IT MAY GET

834
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
TOUGHER BEFORE IT GETS EASIER,

835
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL THERE WITH

836
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
PRAYERS.

ENTIRE COUNTRY MOURNING AS WE

844
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
SEARCH FOR ANSWERS AS TO HOW

845
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
SO MANY YOUNG LIVES, SO MANY

846
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
LIVES COULD BE TAKEN SO

847
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
QUICKLY.
COMING UP NEXT THE ROLE THAT

848
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
STATES CAN PLAY IN TIMES LIKE
THIS.
