HAS CERTAIN BEHAVIORS LIKE WE

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
HAVE SEEN IN THE SHOOTER.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
ARE ANY OF THESE DISORDERS THE

TYPE THAT WOULD EXHIBIT

DAYS BUT THERE ARE SIGNS AND

SYMPTOMS THAT LEAD UP TO CERTAIN

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
BEHAVIORS.

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
CAN ACTUALLY GO BACK AND SEE

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
WHAT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
WHO MAY HAVE A CHILD WHO HAS

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
EITHER AUTISM OR ASPERGER'S A

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
PRESENCE OF SOME FORM OF AWE

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
SICHL OR ASPERGER'S SUBJECT MAKE

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THEM SAY MY CHILD IS A MASS

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
MURDERER JUST BECAUSE OF THE

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
DISORDER.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
>> IT IS REALLY THE BEHAVIORS

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
YOU WANT TO LOOK AT.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
IT'S THE CHANGE IN BEHAVIORS HAD

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
A ARE REALLY OF CONCERN.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
YOU HAVE A CHILD WHO IS DOING

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
WELL IN SCHOOL, SOCIALLY ACTIVE,

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
IS BEHAVING APPROPRIATELY AND

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
SUDDENLY THERE'S A CHANGE THEY

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
BECOME MORE ISOLATE TIVE THEY

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
BECOME MORE SOCIALLY

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
UNENGAGEABLE.

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
THEY DON'T WANT TO TO GO TO

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
SCHOOL THEIR GRADES GO DOUVENL

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
THOSE SHOULD BE SIGNS TO PARENTS

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
TO TAKE A LOOK AT AND PUT INTO

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
CONTEXT THE BEHAVIOR AND ANY

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
SYMPTOMS OR ANY DIAGNOSES THAT

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
MAY BE AT PLAY.

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
>> THE REASON I WANT TO DELVE

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I THINK SOME PARENTS SAY I DON'T

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MY CHILD

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
ASPERGER'S OR ANY FORM OF

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
AUTISM.
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A VALID

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
CONCLUSION EITHER IS IT?

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
THERE ARE FIRST OF ALL AUTISM IS

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A SPECTRUM DISORDER.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
SO THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
BEHAVIORS AND SYMPTOMS ALONG THE

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
WAY.
IN ADDITION THERE ARE OTHER

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
DISORDERS THAT ARE AT PLAY.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
THERE ARE SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
ISSUES AND MAL LODY DISORDERS,

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
CHARACTER LOGICAL DISORDERS.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
YOU NEED TO FOCUS IN ON WHAT IT

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
IS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
WE TRY VERY HARD TO ASCERTAIN A

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
DIAGNOSIS OR A WORKING DIAGNOSIS

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
AND THEN GO FROM THERE AND SORT

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
OUT WHAT ARE OUR EXPECTATIONS

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT TO BE FIRST

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT TO BE TREATED

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
WHAT INTERVENTIONS CAN WE BRING

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
TO BEAR?

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
WE WORK AS A TEAM APPROACH SO

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THAT WE CAN BRING IN MENTAL

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, CASE

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS DIE KIE TERRORISTS

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
WHO ADDRESS EACH INDIVIDUAL

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
SYMPTOM BASED ON WHAT IS GOING

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
ON PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND I

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
PSYCHIATRICALLY.
>> OUR AUDIENCE HEARD A LOT OF

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
WORDS THROWN AT THEM OVER THE

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
WEEKEND.
WORDS THAT YOU USE EVERY DAY IN

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
THE COURSE OF YOUR PRACTICE OF

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
LAW AND PSYCHOLOGY BUT MOST

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
PEOPLE DON'T USE THESE WORDS

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
MAYBE THEY ARE NOT FAMILIAR TO

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
THEM.
WHEN WE SAY THAT A PERSON IS A

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
PSYCHOTIC, HAS PSYCHOTIC

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
BEHAVIORAL TENDENCIES WHAT DOES

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
THAT MEAN?

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
>> THAT USUALLY MEANS A BREAK

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
WITH REALITY.

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO SEE THINGS

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
REALISTICALLY YOU ARE NOT

156
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
PROCESS THINGS COMING IN IN A

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
REALISTIC WAY.

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
>> AND A SOCIOPATH WHAT DOES IT

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
MEAN IF A PERSON IS DESCRIBED AS

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
SOCIOPATHIC?

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
>> SOCIOPATHS IS A CHARACTER

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
LOGICAL DISORDER.

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
IT IS MANIFEST BY USUALLY PEOPLE

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
WHO CAN'T FEEL, THEY DON'T HAVE

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
EMPATHY.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
THEY DON'T CONNECT TO THE USUAL

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
DAY-TO-DAY FEELINGS THAT MOST OF

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
US CAN CONNECT TO.

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
>> SO SOME PEOPLE COULD BE SOME

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
WHAT PSYCHOTIC AND SOCIOPATHIC,

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
IS IT POSSIBLE TO BE A PERSON

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
WITH BOTH CHARACTER RYES

173
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
RISTICKS?
>> FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH

174
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
EXPERTS I WORK WITH EVERY DAY I

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
BELIEVE THE ANSWER TO THAT WOULD

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
BE YES.

177
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
>> SO THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO MAKE

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THIS IS VERY COMPLEX.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN TAKE A

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
CHILD AND SAY HE HAS ASPERGER'S

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
THEREFORE HE IS MORE LIKELY TO

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
DO A MASS MURDER AND BY THE WAY

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
THAT MEANS HE IS PSYCHOTIC.

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
IT INVOLVES A COMPLEX KIND OF

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
DIAGNOSIS.
>> A COMPLEX DIAGNOSIS AS WELL

187
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
AS PUTTING IT INTO CONTEXT AND

188
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
REALLY LOOKING AT HOW TO ACCESS

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
IN THE REAL WORLD.

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
THE TREATMENTS MIGHT BE

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
INTERVENTION GETTING HELP IT'S

192
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
THE BIGGEST WE FACE.

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
HAVING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THIS

194
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
THEY CAN GET PAST THAT HURDLE

195
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
THEY ARE MORE OPEN TO ALLOWING

196
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
EXPERTS IN THE FIELD TO

197
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
INTERVENE AND TRY AND HEAD OFF

198
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
ANY PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD.

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
>> YOU CARRY THE STIGMA.

200
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.

201
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I FEEL FOR FOR PARENTS WHO ARE

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
AFRAID TO SAY MY CHILD MAY HAVE

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
A MENTAL ILLNESS.

204
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
YOU HAVE THE CHILD SAYING

205
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME

206
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

207
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
YOU NEED TO HELP PEOPLE

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
UNDERSTAND THAT A MENTAL ILLNESS

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
IS NO DIFFERENT THAN A PHYSICAL

210
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
INFIRMITY.
WE DON'T SAY A PERSON HAS A

211
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
BROKEN LEG THAT WOULD BE

212
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
EMBARRASSING SOMEBODY MIGHT

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
THINK MY CHILD HAS A BROKEN LEG

214
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
OR A PEND SITET-- APPEND SITETI.

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
HOW CAN WE GET PEOPLE WHERE AS

216
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
IT WERE COMPARABLE TO ANY

217
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
PHYSICAL ILLNESS WE MAY HAVE.

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
>> I SAY IN MY PRACTICE TO MY

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
CLIENTS EVERY DAY.
THAT GOES BACK TO THE

220
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
CONVERSATION THEY NEED TO HAVE

221
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
WITH ONE ANOTHER.

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
CONVERSATION THEY NEED TO HAVE

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
WITH THEIR PHYSICIANS WITH OTHER

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WITH

225
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
WHOM THEY WORK WITH THE MENTAL

226
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
HEALTH ATTORNEYS.

227
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
THEY NEED TO HAVE THAT

228
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
CONVERSATION AND SAY EXACTLY

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
THAT IT'S A BRAIN CHEMISTRY

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
ISSUE IT'S ILLNESS.

231
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
IF YOU HAVE A HEART PROBLEM YOU

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
GO TO THE CARDIOLOGIST.

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
IF YOU BREAK YOUR LEG YOU PUT A

234
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
CAST ON IT.

235
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
IT HAS BEEN SO MANY DECADES OF

236
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
PEOPLE HAVING THAT STIGMA AND

237
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
THINKING IT'S BAD.

238
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
ALSO THE PUBLICITY THAT GOES

239
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
WITH IT.

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
EVERY TIME THERE IS A TRAGEDY

241
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
SUCH AS THE ONE WE HAVE SEEN

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THIS WEEK THE FIRST QUESTIONS

243
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
ASKED ARE IF YOU HAVE A MENTAL

244
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
ILLNESS RATHER THAN WHAT WENT ON

245
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
WITH THIS INDIVIDUAL OR WHAT

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
MIGHT READ LED UP TO IT OR WHAT

247
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
ISSUES ARE WE FACING.

248
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
YOU NEED TO DE STIGMATIZE IT AS

249
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
MUCH AS WE CAN.

250
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
>> IT IS AN IMPORTANT THING THAT

251
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
HAS TO HAPPEN.

252
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
HOPEFULLY AT SOME POINT IN OUR

253
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
CULTURE THERE HAS BEEN A COMMON

254
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
DENOMINATOR SEEMINGLY.

255
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
A LOT OF THESE MASS SHOOTINGS

256
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
INVOLVING YOUNG PEOPLE OR EVEN

257
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
CHILDREN THE COMMON DENOMINATOR

258
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
IS THE PROLIFIC MANNER IN WHICH

259
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
MANY OF THESE KIDS PLAYED VERY

260
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES.

261
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I WANT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO

262
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
IMMEDIATELY DRAW THE LINE FROM

263
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
THE VIDEO GAMES TO THE BEHAVIOR

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME

265
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
CONNECTION.
DO YOU SEE A CONNECTION?

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
IF SO HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THIS?

267
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
>> AGAIN I THINK YOU HAVE TO PUT

268
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
ALL OF THIS INTO CONTEXT.

269
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
IF YOU ARE SEEING OTHER

270
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
BEHAVIORS AND THEY ARE PLAYING

271
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
VIDEO GAMES, THERE IS PROBABLY A

272
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
BIGGER ISSUE THAN THE VIDEO

273
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
GAMES.
THERE IS A LOT OF TALK A LOT OF

274
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
RESEARCH BEING DONE ON WHETHER

275
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
VIDEO GAMES ACTUALLY LEAVE THE

276
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
VIOLENCE.

277
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I THINK IT IS VERY HARD TO

278
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
CONNECT UP THE TWO.

279
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
WHEN WE TAKE A HISTORY THERE'S A

280
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
LOT MORE GOING ON IN THE COURSE

281
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
OF THE DISCUSSION THAN JUST MY

282
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
SON OR DAUGHTER SPENDS ALL DAY

283
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.

284
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I THINK HE NEEDS TO HAVE A

285
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
PREDISPOSITION FOR THE VIDEO

286
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
GAMES TO ACTUALLY CAUSE YOU TO

287
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
THEN TAKE SOME SORT OF NEGATIVE

288
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
ACTION OR BECOME VIOLENT.

289
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
>> I WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THAT

290
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
THOUGHT WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK

291
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
WITH CAROLYN WOLF WHEN WE RETURN

292
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
WITH THIS SPECIAL EDITION OF

293
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
"HUCKABEE.

294
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
[ Male Announcer ] THIS IS
JOE WOODS' FIRST DAY OF WORK.

295
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
AND HIS NEW BOSS TOLD HIM
TWO THINGS --

296
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
COOK WHAT YOU LOVE,
AND SAVE YOUR MONEY.

297
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
JOE DOESN'T KNOWT YET,
BUT HE'LL WORK HIS WAY UP

298
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
FROM BUSSER TO WAITER TO CHEF
BEFORE OPENING A RESTAURANT

299
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
SPECIALIZING IN FISH AND GAME
FROM THE GREAT NORTHWEST.

300
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
HE'LL START INVESTING EARLY,

301
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
HE'LL FIND SOME GOOD PEOPLE
TO HELP GUIDE HIM,

302
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
AND HE'LL SET MONEY ASIDE
FROM HIS FIRST DAY OF WORK

303
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
TO HIS LAST,

304
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
WHICH ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

305
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.

306
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
FROM TD AMERITRADE.

307
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
>> WE ARE BACK.
WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT

308
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
THE VIDEO GAMES AND THE

309
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
INFLUENCE THEY HAVE.

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I THINK YOU MADE AN IMPORTANT

311
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
POINT.
JUST BECAUSE A KID PLAY AS VIDEO

312
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
GAME EVEN A VIOLENT ONE DOESN'T

313
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
MEAN HE IS GOING TO TURN INTO A

314
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
MASS MURDERER.

315
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
IF THERE IS A CHILD WHO HAS

316
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
CERTAIN THINGS GOING ON IN HIS

317
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
HEAD THE DETACHMENT FROM

318
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
REALITY, THE INABILITY.

319
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
IT COULD BE A TRIGGER POINT TO

320
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
TAKE HIM OFF TO WHERE MOST KIDS

321
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
WOULDN'T GO.

322
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
>> THAT'S THE CONTEXT YOU HAVE

323
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
TO PUT THIS INTO.

324
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
PEOPLE, PARENTS, TEACHERS,

325
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
FRIENDS, WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH

326
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
FRIENDS NOT WANTING TO RAT THEIR

327
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
FRIENDS OUT OR TATTLE ON THEM.

328
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
FRIENDS OF MANY OF THESE

329
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
INDIVIDUALS COULD ACTUALLY BE

330
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
VERY HELPFUL IN AT LEAST

331
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
BRINGING TO AN ADULT'S ATTENTION

332
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE.

333
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
THEY PLAY THEIR VIDEO GAMES WITH

334
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
A LOT OF THE TIME.

335
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
THEY A

336
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
THEIR FRIENDS.

337
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT

338
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
IN THE BIGGER PICTURE.

339
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN THE

340
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
BIGGER PICTURE IN ADDITION TO

341
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
WATCHING THE VIDEO GAMES.

342
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
IT COULD ACT AS A TRIGGER.

343
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
>> IT IS EASY TO LOOK BACK AT

344
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
CERTAIN TYNE SIGNS PEOPLE ARE

345
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
SAYING SHE MUST HAVE SEEN

346
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
BEHAVIORAL TENDENCIES WITH HER

347
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
SON SHE PULLED HIM OUT OF SCHOOL

348
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
AND HOME SCHOOLED.

349
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
REPORTS ARE SHE HAD A COLLECTION

350
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
OF GUNS TAUGHT HIM HOW TO USE

351
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
THEM.
TALK ABOUT RED FLAGS THAT YOU

352
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
COULD IDENTIFY IN THIS SITUATION

353
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW REALIZING

354
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
IT'S AN INCOMPLETE PICTURE AT

355
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
THIS POINT.
>> WE FOUND WE CAN TRAIN

356
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
PARENTS, SCHOOLS, COLLEGE

357
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
PERSONNEL, FACULTY TEACHERS TO

358
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
IDENTIFY BEHAVIORS.

359
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
THEY 2K5DON'T HAVE TO BE EXPERT.

360
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
THEY START TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE

361
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
NORMAL BEHAVIOR.

362
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
A KID WHO SITS IN THE FRONT OF

363
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
THE ROOM SUDDENLY IS SITTING IN

364
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
THE BACK AND IS QUIET AND

365
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
WRITING STRANGE THINGS AND

366
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
PARENTS CAN DO THE SAME THING.

367
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
THEY CAN NOTICE THEIR CHILDREN

368
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
ARE MOERMALNORMALLY HAPPY AND A

369
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
AND SOCIAL AND NOW ARE SUDDENLY

370
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
ISOLATING SPENDING MORE TIME IN

371
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
THEIR ROOMS HAVING TROUBLES IN

372
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
SCHOOL.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TAKE

373
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
SOME SORT OF ACTION RATHER THAN

374
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
PULLING THEM INTO THE ICE LAYING

375
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
HOME SCHOOLING THEM FOR EXAMPLE.

376
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I AM NOT SAYING THAT MAY NOT BE

377
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
APPROPRIATE IN SOME CASES BUT IT

378
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
IS ISOLATING.

379
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
PARENTS SHOULD GO TO THE SCHOOL

380
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
TALK TO THE GUIDE DANCE

381
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
COUNSELORS ASK WHAT'S GOING ON.

382
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I AM SEEING A CHANGE AT HOME.

383
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
>> THERE ARE ALSO BEHAVIORS THAT

384
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
CAN BE TRIGGERED BY FAMILY

385
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
SITUATIONS.

386
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
YOU HAVE A MOTHER AND FATHER WHO

387
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
DIVORCED A FEW YEARS AGO.

388
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
THAT CHANGES THE STRUNG TOUR I

389
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
AM NOT SAYING YOU BLAME THE

390
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
PARENTS BUT IF THE CHILD IS

391
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
MANIFESTING CERTAIN BEHAVIORS

392
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
BECAUSE OF A DIVORCE A DEATH IN

393
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
THE FAMILY A LOSS OF A PET THERE

394
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
COULD BE MANY THINGS HAD A HELP

395
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
TRIGGER BEHAVIORS.

396
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
>> THAT'S WHY WE WORK CLOSELY

397
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
WITH PARENTS TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

398
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE HOME

399
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
WHAT CHANGE LED TO DIFFERENT

400
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
BEHAVIORS IN CHILDREN AND THEN

401
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
BRINGING IN A TEAM OF MENTAL

402
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN

403
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
THEN ADDRESS THE CHANGES.

404
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
BECAUSE THEY ARE AGAIN EASY TO

405
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
IDENTIFY IN A LOT OF CASES YOU

406
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
JUST HAVE TO KNOW WHAT TO LOOK

407
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
FOR.

408
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
>> I THINK PEOPLE ARE AFRAID

409
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
SOMETIMES TO RAISE THE FLAG.

410
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
THEY ARE VERY RELUCTANT WITH

411
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND OTHERS

412
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID EITHER

413
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
OF LIABILITIES OR THEY WILL BE

414
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
SEEN AS STICKING THEIR NOSE IN

415
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
SOMEONE ELSE'S BUSINESS.

416
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
WHERE IS THAT LINE OF PRO PRITY?

417
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
OO I THINK AS WE SEE MORE AND

418
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
MORE OF THESE INCIDENTS AND

419
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
TRAGEDIES THE DIALOGUE IS JUST

420
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
STARTING TO BE MORE TOWARDS WE

421
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AND TALK

422
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
ABOUT IT AND SET UP SYSTEMS TO

423
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
ADDRESS IT.

424
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
AFTER THE AURORA SHOOTING WE

425
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
HEARD ABOUT THE BEHAVIORAL

426
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
INTERVENTION TEAMS ON COLLEGE

427
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
CAMPUSES THEY ARE SET UP

428
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
SPECIFICALLY TO IDENTIFY KIDS AT

429
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
RISK OR KIDS REPORTED TO HAVE AT

430
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
RISK BEHAVIOR OR RED FLAG

431
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
BEHAVIOR.
THEN NOT JUST TO TARGET THEM SO

432
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
TO SPEAK OR SPY ON THEM BUT TO

433
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
COME UP WITH AN INTERVENTION AND

434
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
A RESPONSE THAT IS

435
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
MULTIDISCIPLINARY THAT CAN

436
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT ARE

437
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
BEING BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT.

438
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I BELIEVE UNFORTUNATELY NOW

439
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
SCHOOLS HAVE TO START TO DO

440
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
THAT.
IN THE LOWER SCHOOLS IT IS

441
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
UNIMAGINABLE YOU WOULD DO THAT

442
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT YOU

443
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
NEED TO LOOK AT THAT AND NEED TO

444
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
DO THAT.

445
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
>> CAROLYN THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

446
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
VERY HELPFUL AND PRACTICAL.

447
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE.

448
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

449
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
>> I HOPE PEOPLE WILL USE THIS

450
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALIZE IF

451
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
THERE IS EVIDENCE OF MENTAL

452
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
ILLNESS IN YOUR CHILD OR

453
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
YOURSELF THAT YOU DON'T FEEL

454
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
LIKE SOMEHOW IT OUGHT TO BE

455
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
EMBARRASSING TO GET HELP.

456
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
WE OUGHT TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE

457
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
IT IS EMBARRASSING TO NOT GET

458
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
THE HELP.

459
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I WILL TALK TO ALLEN DEDER

460
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
>> ALLEN HAS REPRESENTED SOME OF

461
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
AMERICA'S MOST REVILED

462
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
DEFENDANTS LIKE CLAUSE VAN BEULE

463
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
LOW AND O.J. SIMPSON IN THE CASE

464
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
OF THE CONNECTICUT SHOOTING THE

465
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
GUNMAN IS DEAD.

466
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
THERE WILL BE NO TRIAL.

467
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
BUT I ASKED THE PROFESSOR HAD

468
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
THE GUNMAN LIVED HOW OLD HE

469
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
DEFEND SOMEONE RESPONSIBLE FOR

470
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST HEINOUS

471
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
CRIMES.
>> IT'S THE CALL EVERY GOOD

472
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
LAWYER DREADS GENERALLY HAPPENS

473
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
A JUDGE WILL CALL YOU AND SAY

474
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
YOU ARE A RESPECTED LAWYER, THE

475
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
SYSTEM REQUIRES THIS MAN BE

476
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED YOU HAVE THE

477
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
JOB OF DEFENDING HIM.

478
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR VERY BEST.

479
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW IS AN

480
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
EMERGENCY DOCTOR AT IS AN

481
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
EMERGENCY DOCTOR AT COLUMBIA

482
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL.

483
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
THEY WHEEL PEOPLE INTO HER WHO

484
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
ARE TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE HUMAN

485
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
BEINGS SHE HAS TO MAKE THEM

486
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
BETTER THE SYSTEM REQUIRES THAT.

487
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
IN THAT CAA CASE LIKE THIS YOU

488
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
LOOK INTO HIS MENTAL BACKGROUND

489
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
YOU SEE IF THERE'S A PLAUSIBLE

490
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
CLAIM OF MENTAL ILLNESS.

491
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
YOU KNOW IF HE GOES TO JAIL HE

492
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
WILL BE KILLED IN JAIL.

493
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
THE WORST TREATMENT ARE GIVEN TO

494
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
PEOPLE WHO KILLED YOUNG CHILDREN

495
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
UNDERSTANDABLY SO, AND SO IT IS

496
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
ALWAYS GOING TO BE A LIFE AND

497
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
DEATH MATTER EVEN IF HE IS

498
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
FACING LIFE IMPRISONMENT.

499
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
>> YOU HAVE PERSONAL FEELINGS

500
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
YOU HAVE TO SET ASIDE.

501
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
>> IT IS SO HARD.

502
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
YOU WANT TO SEE THIS SOB GET THE

503
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
LONGEST POSSIBLE SENTENCE.

504
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
THE FIRST INCLINATION IS YOU

505
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
WANT TO STRANGLE THE MAN WITH

506
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
YOUR BARE HANDS.

507
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
WE HAVE ALL EXPERIENCED THAT.

508
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
YOU HAVE TO DISTANCE YOURSELF BE

509
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
PROFESSIONAL ABOUT IT AND YOU

510
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SYSTEM IS

511
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
ON TRIAL WHEN EVER THE MOST

512
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
NOTORIOUS OFFENDERS.

513
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I REMEMBER BEING IN REAL SHORTLY

514
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
AFTER THE EICHMANN TRIAL WHEN A

515
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
MAN WHO KILLED IS RESPONSIBLE

516
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
FOR KILLING 6 MILLION JEWS WENT

517
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
ON TRIAL.
HE HAD A VIGOROUS DEFENSE

518
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
ATTORNEY WHO DID A GOOD JOB.

519
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
COULDN'T SAVE THEM, OBVIOUSLY

520
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
BUT THAT'S THE DREADED MOMENT

521
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
EVERY LAWYER FACES IS BEING

522
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
CALLED ON TO HIS OR HER DUTY IN

523
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
A CASE LIKE THIS.

524
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
>> IS THERE A TENDENCY TO TRY TO

525
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
GET THAT PERSON TO PLEAD GUILTY

526
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
TO GET IT OVER WITH AND TAKE A

527
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
PLEA DEAL AS OPPOSED TO GOING

528
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
THROUGH TRIAL OR PLEAD INNOCENT?

529
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
DO YOU ACTUALLY SAY DO YOU WANT

530
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
TO PLEAD INNOCENT?

531
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
>> YOU GIVE THE PERSON ALL OF

532
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
THE OPTIONS.

533
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
THEY GENERALLY DON'T WANT TO

534
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
PLEAD GUILTY.

535
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
THEY ALSO DON'T WANT YOU TO

536
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
PLEAD AN INSANITY DEFENSE.

537
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
THEY WANT YOU TO GET UP THERE

538
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
AND JUSTIFY IT AND EXPLAIN TO

539
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
THE WRORLD WORLD WHY HE DID THE

540
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
THING.
POLITICAL DEFENSES AREN'T

541
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
ALLOWED AND SHOULDN'T BE

542
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
ALLOWED.
BUT DEALING WITH THE CLIENT WILL

543
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
BE ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS.

544
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I HAVE HAD CLIENTS THREATEN ME

545
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
ONE CLIENT TRY TO STRANGLE ME.

546
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
HE HAD BEEN TURNING ON HIS

547
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
FRIENDS.

548
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
BEING A CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYER

549
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
IS NOT THE SAFEST OR EASIEST

550
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
JOB.
IF YOU WIN, WHICH IN A CASE LIKE

551
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
THIS YOU COULDN'T, THEN MILLIONS

552
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
OF PEOPLE HATE YOU AND WANT TO

553
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
GET YOU I HAD TO HAVE A FEDERAL

554
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
AGENT FOLLOW ME AROUND BECAUSE I

555
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
WOULDN'T TAKE THE CASE ANY MORE.

556
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
THE PERSON I WOULDN'T TAKE THE

557
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
CASE FROM PUT A HIT OUT ON ME.

558
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
>> WE HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION,

559
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO DEFEND

560
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
SOMEONE IF WE KNOW -- NOT JUST

561
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
KNOW HE'S GUILTY BUT KNOW HE IS

562
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
GUILTY OF SOMETHING SO

563
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
OUTRAGEOUS SO HEINOUS THERE IS

564
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
NOT A PERSON IN THIS SOCIETY

565
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
THAT DEFENDS THE ACTION OF THE

566
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
PERSON WHO DID IT?

567
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
>> IT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

568
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
ONCE YOU SAY THERE ISN'T ANYBODY

569
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
WHO CAN GET A DEFENSE WHICH

570
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
PROVIDE ALL DEFENDANTS MUST BE

571
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED THEN WE MOVE

572
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
THE LINE WHAT IF WE ARE ALMOST

573
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
CERTAIN HE DID SOMETHING SO WERE

574
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
TERRIBLE EVEN INNOCENCE

575
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
SHOULDN'T BE A DEFENSE.

576
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
YOU VISSER RATE THE BASIC

577
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
FUNDAMENTAL DEFENSES.

578
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
OUR JOB IS TO DEFEND THE SOB'S.

579
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
COME AFTER THEM FIRST.

580
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
THEN THEY APPLY THE LAW TO THE

581
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
REST OF US.

582
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
EVERY TIME YOU DEFEND A

583
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PERSON YOU

584
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
ARE DEFENDING SOMEBODY WHO LOVES

585
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
YOU AND YOU LOVE AND YOU MAY BE

586
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
IN TROUBLE STATEMENT IN TIME.

587
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
SOME SAY A LIBERAL WHO HAS BEEN

588
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
MUGGED.
THERE'S TRUTH TO THAT.

589
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
A KID HAS BEEN BUSTED ON A

590
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
CHARGE AND REALLY NEED YOU TO

591
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
COME AND DPEE FEND HIM ON THE

592
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
BASIS OF THE 6TH AMENDMENT OR

593
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
4TH AMENDMENT.

594
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA IS THAT

595
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
OUR RIGHTS APPLY TO EVERYBODY.

596
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH

597
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
RIGHTS.
IF I WERE WRITING THE

598
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
CONSTITUTION I WOULD NOT PUT A

599
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
SECOND AMENDMENT IN THERE.

600
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
>> BUT IS IT IS IN THERE AND I E

601
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
TO DEFEND THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE

602
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
REASONABLY REGULATED TO BE SURE

603
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
BUT THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO HAVE

604
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
ACCESS TO GUNS.

605
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
WE MAY NOT LIKE EVERYTHING IN

606
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
THE CONSTITUTION BUT IT SERVED

607
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
US VERY WELL.

608
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
THE LONGEST ENDURING

609
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
CONSTITUTION IN HISTORY IT AIN'T

610
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
BROKE WE SHOULD NOT BE TAMPERING

611
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
WITH IT.

612
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
>> I AM SO GLAD YOU SAID THAT.

613
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I THINK SOMETIMES WE FORGET WHAT

614
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
AN AMAZING DOCUMENT.

615
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
THEY CAME TOGETHER AND

616
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
MIRACULOUSLY ENDED UP WITH A

617
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
DOCUMENT THAT GOVERNED US AND

618
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
GIVEN US A GOVERNMENT THAT IS

619
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
THE ENVY OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD.

620
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
>> IT IS A MIRACLE.

621
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN TODAY.

622
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
WE COULD NEVER GET AGREEMENT

623
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
TODAY ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT

624
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
WHAT DOES IT MEAN ABOUT PRAYER

625
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
IN THE SCHOOLS.

626
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
COULDN'T GET AN AGREEMENT ON THE

627
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
5TH AMENDMENT.

628
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
WE WERE FORTUNATE TO GET A

629
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
COLLECTION OF RIGHTS.

630
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
THIRD AMENDMENT YOU CAN'T

631
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
QUARTER TROOPS IN YOUR HOME.

632
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
BUT THAT DEALS WITH PRIVACY

633
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
RIGHTS.
THE HOME IS YOUR CASTLE.

634
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
WHEN THE EASTERN EUROPEAN GOT

635
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
THEIR UNION WAS DEFEATED THE

636
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
FIRST CONSTITUTIONS THEY LOOK TO

637
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
WAS THE UNITED STATES

638
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
CONSTITUTION.
>> A GREAT REMINDER WE HAVE A

639
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
SYSTEM.
WE DON'T JUST LET OURSELVES BE

640
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
GOVERNED BY OUR EMOTIONS BUT BY

641
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
OUR CONSTITUTION AND LAWS.

642
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
>> OUR SYSTEM GOES ON TRIAL

643
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
EVERY TIME WE SEE A CAT CAST FEE

644
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
LIKE THIS ONE.

645
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
>> THANK YOU.

646
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
>> THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS

647
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
ASKING ABOUT THE SHOOTING IN NEW

648
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
TOWN.
THE MOST ASKED QUESTION IS

649
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
PROBABLY WHY.
IS THERE AN ANSWER TO THAT

650
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
QUESTION?

651
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I WILL ASK PASTOR JOEL OLSTEEN

652
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
AND HIS WIFE VICTORIA NEXT.

653
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000

655
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
>>> I THINK I AM STILL VERY NUMB

656
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
AND JUST LIKE ROBERT HAD SAID WE

657
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
ARE BLESSED WITH HAVING OUR

658
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
DAUGHTER WITH US HERE TODAY.

659
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
HOW MANY FAMILIES AND FRIENDS

660
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
AND EVERYONE WITHIN THE

661
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
COMMUNITY DIDN'T GO HOME WITH

662
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
THEIR CHILDREN FRIDAY NIGHT.

663
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
IT IS JUST VERY, VERY HEART

664
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
WRENCHING AND THERE IS NO WAY TO

665
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
MAKE ANY SENSE OF ANYTHING WITH

666
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
THIS PERSON HAS DONE.

667
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
>> NOW THAT THE VICTIMS OF THE

668
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
SHOOTING AT SANDY HOOK

669
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HAVE BEEN

670
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
IDENTIFIED THE COMMUNITY IS

671
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
FOCUSING ON REMEMBERING AND

672
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
HONORING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN

673
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
LOST.

LET'S GO TO FOX'S AN TAW KOOIMAN

IN SAINT ROSE CHURCH IN NEWTOWN.

676

>> AS THE NATION SEARCH

677
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
THEY HAD QUITE A SCARE AS LAW

678
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
ENFORCEMENT RUSHED INTO THEIR

00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
CAMPUS TODAY.

681
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
>> NEW FOUND POLICE AND A SOAKS

PERSON SAY A CALL CAME IN WHERE

683
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
A MAN THREATENED TO KILL PEOPLE

684
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
IN A CHURCH.

685
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
EVERYTHING IS OKAY.

686
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
BUT NOT BEFORE AN EVACUATION.

687
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
>> THE PAST INTERRUPTED PEOPLE

688
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
LEFT VERY CALMLY AND GREAT

689
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
DIGNI

690
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
DIGNITY.

691
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
WE PRAY THERE WILL BE MOW MORE

692
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
ON THIS CAMPUS TODAY.

693
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
THE FUNERALS WILL BE HELD LATER

IN THE WEEK AND THE PRIESTS ARE

695
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
REPAIRING FOR IT AND STILL

696
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
WORKING WITH FAMILIES.

697
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
WARNING WAS THERE A FELLOW

698
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
NEIGHBOR DISHEARTENED.

699
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
THIS IS ALREADY THE TOUGH DATE

700
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
FOR THE COMMUNITY.

701
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
AS THE MEDICAL EXAMINER 12 GIRLS

THEY LOST MANY OF THE PLAYMATES

704
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
AND FAVORITE TEACHERS.

705
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THIRD GRADER ALI CARRIES AROUND

VICTORIA SOTO.

708

>> MY FAVORITE FIRST GRADE

709
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
TEACHER.

710
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
>> THEY HAVE NO WAY TO HELP THE

711
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
VICTIM'S FAMILIES EXCEPT THEY

712
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
ARE SAFE AND PRAYER.

713
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
CHURCH OFFICIALS LOCKED UP THE

714

SANCTUARY SAYING THE PRIESTS

715
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
HAVE A LOT TO PREPARE FOR.

716
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
8 OF THE 26 VICTIMS ARE FROM

717
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
THIS PERISH ALONE, GOVERNOR.

718
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
>>> WHEN A TRAGEDY LIKE THIS

719
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
HAPPENS.

720
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I AM UNDOUBTEDLY ASKING WHY.

721
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
>> I SPOKE WITH JOEL OLSTEEN AND

722
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
HIS WIFE.

723
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
WHAT DO YOU TELL PEOPLE WHEN

724
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
THEY ASK HIM.

725
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
WHY DIDN'T THEY STOP SOMETHING

726
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
LIKE THIS FROM HAPPENING.

727
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
>> I THINK THE BIGGEST THING WE

728
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS GOD SAGAV

729
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
US OUR OWN FREE WILL.

730
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
HE DIDN'T MAKE US ROBOTS.

731
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
UNFORTUNATELY JUST AS YOU CAN

732
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
CHOOSE GOOD OR EVIL.

733
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
IT'S NOT A PERFECT PLACE.

734
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
JESUS CAN'T SAY IN THIS WORYOU

735
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
GOING -- YOU PUT YOUR TRUST IN

736
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
THE LORD AND HE WILL GIVE YOU

737
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
THE STRENGTH TO MAKE IT THROUGH

738
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
EVEN THOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT.

739
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
>> WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT THAT

740
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
STRENGTH HOW DO THEY FIND IT?

741
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
OP WHY YOU WILL PEOPLE WHO BRAY

742
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
OUT TO GOD IN PRAYER.

743
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
THEY HEAR ABOUT PRAYER, NEVER NE

744
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
DON IT.

745
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
WHAT DO THEY DO?

746
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
>> I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT.

747
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
TO ME IT'S FINE TO BE.

748
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I THINK YOU ARE HONEST WITH GOD

749
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
SCRIPTURE SAYS MY ENCOURAGEMENT

750
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE BET BIGGER HE

751
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
WOULDN'T HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN.

752
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I GO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION I

753
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
SAY IN THESE TOUGH TIMES I AM

754
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
GOING TO TURN TO MY FAITH AND

755
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
BELIEF GOD IS FOR ME.

756
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
IT'S A SIMPLE ACT OF FAITH.

757
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
IT MAY NOT MAKE SENSE TO YOUR

758
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
MIND YOU HAVE GOD HAS GOT YOU IN

759
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
THE HAND.

760
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
>> SO MANY PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO

761
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
FIND THE SOLID GROUND OF THEIR

762
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
FAITH RIGHT NOW.

763
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
THERE'S NO WAY TO MAKE SENSE

764
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CHILDREN

765
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
WELLS TO THE EACHTEACHERS.

766
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
WHAT ADVICE DO YOU GIVE THEM FOR

767
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET

768
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
BACK THEIR FAIRT IN A MOMENT

769
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
WHEN DE THIS HAVE ANY HUMAN

770
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
UNDERSTANDING AND HUMAN WORDS TO

771
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
EXPRESS HOW THEY FEEL.

772
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
>> THERE ARE NO HUMAN WORDS TO

773
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
EXPLAIN WHAT HAS HAPPENED OR AT

774
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT GIVE

775
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
COMFORT.
BUT I BELIEVE AS THE COMMUNITY

776
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
GATHERS TOGETHER AS THEY SUPPORT

777
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
ONE ANOTHER, IF THEY LOVE ONE

778
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
ANOTHER.

779
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
THERE ARE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN

780
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
SOMETHING DEFR STATES TO US.

781
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
WE HAVE TO RUN TO GOD TO BELIEVE

782
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
HE HAS LOVED US AND HE CARES

783
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
ABOUT US AND WE CAN GIVE

784
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
THROUGH.

785
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
>> VICTORIA YOU ARE A MOM.

786
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I AM SURE THIS WEEKEND HAS

787
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
BROUGHT UP TEEP EMOTIONS TO

788
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
EVERY MOTHER IN AMERICA.

789
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO YOUR OWN

790
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
CHILDREN THIS WEEKEND ABOUT THIS

791
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
HORRIFIC GLAM CRIME.

792
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY?

793
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
>> THE FIRST THING WE DID IS WE

794
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
PRAYED FOR THOSE FAMILIES.

795
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
WE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT HOW THIS

796
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
IS DIFFICULT FOR THE FAMILIES.

797
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
THERE IS NO EXPLANATION FOR WHAT

798
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
HAD HAPPENED.

799
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
THERE IS PEOPLE THAT DO THINGS

800
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
THAT THEY SHOULDN'T DO AND THERE

801
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
IS EVIL IN THE WORLD.

802
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
BUT THE WAY I BEGIN TO SAY IS

803
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
LET'S PRAY FOR THESE FAMILIES

804
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
AND LIFT THEM UP.

805
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
THAT'S OUR PART RIGHT NOW.

806
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
OF COURSE YOU REALLY CAN'T

807
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
EXPLAIN WHY SOMEONE DOES OR

808
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
DOESN'T DO WHAT THEY DO.

809
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
IT WAS AN EVIL ACT.

810
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I JUST THINK SOMETIMES WE HAVE

811
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
TO SAY LET'S PRAY AND JOIN OUR

812
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
FAITH TOGETHER WITH THESE

813
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
FAMILIES.

814
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
WE MAY NOT KNOW THEM BUT WE CAN

815
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
PRAY FOR THEM AND PRAYER MAKES A

816
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
DIFFERENCE.
>> THE PRESIDENT SHOWED AN

817
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
UNUSUAL LEVEL OF EMOTION CHOKING

818
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
BACK OBVIOUS TEARS AS HE

819
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
RECOGNIZED THESE WERE KIDS VERY

820
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
MUCH LIKE HIS OWN AND IT

821
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
OCCURRED TO ME THIS IS A MAN WHO

822
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
MAY BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

823
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
STATES BUT HE IS A DAD.

824
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I THINK HE SPOKE AND FELT FOR

825
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
EVERY FATHER IN HIS COUNTRY WHEN

826
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
HE TODAY AT THAT PODIUM TRYING

827
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
FEELINGS AS A DAD HOW DOWRY

AFRAID THE NEXT TIME WE THENT ON

831
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
THE SIDEWALKS AND THE STREETS.

832
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
>> YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE GOD HAS

833
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
YOU IN THE FALL AM OF HIS HANDS

834
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
AND NOTHING WITH SNATCH YOU

835
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
AWAY.

836
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
THE NUMBER OF DAYS GOD WILL

837
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
FULFILL.

838
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
WE UNDERSTAND IT WHY SOME KIDS

839
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
WERE TAKEN OTHERS WERE NOT.

840
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
WE TO TRUST GOD IS IN CONTROL.

841
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
NOT LIVE YOUR LIVES BITTER.

842
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
WE PRAYED AND THEN IT REIGNITED

843
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
OUR FAITH LET'S REACH OUT TO

844
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
OTHERS.

845
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
WE TALKED ABOUT GOVERNOR -- IT

846
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000

847
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
AS A GIFT.

848
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE WE WILL

849
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
HAVE TOMORROW WITH EACH OTHER.

850
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I HOPE WE DO.

851
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
IT REALLY HELPS TO GET OUR

852
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000

APPRECIATION.

857
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000

860
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
>> BACK WITH JOEL AND VICTORIA

861
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
OLSTEEN FROM THEIR CHURCH IN

862
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
HOUSTON TEXAS.

863
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
DID YOU WATCH YOUR KIDS WATCH

864
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
THE COVERAGE ON THE NEWS AND HOW

865
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
DID YOU MONITOR TO MAKE SURE IT

866
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
WASN'T TOO MUCH OF AN EMOTIONAL

867
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
OVER LOAD FOR THEM?

868
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
>> OUR CHILDREN ARE 17 AND 14.

869
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
THEY ARE A LITTLE OLDER THAN IF

870
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I HAD FIRST, SECOND GRADERS.

871
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
IT IS REALLY A HARD THING, WAS

872
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
EVERY WHERE YOU LOOK THEY ARE

873
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
TALKING ABOUT IT.

874
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I THINK THERE'S GOOD REPORTS OUT

875
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
THERE.
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE HEROS

876
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
THAT CAME THROUGH EVEN THOUGH

877
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
THEY COST HEAR LIFE THE TEACHERS

878
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
WHO TOOK THE CHILDREN UNDER HEAR

879
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
WINGS AND BEGAN TO PROTECT THEM.

880
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
THERE ARE THOSE HEROS.

881
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
YOU CAN ALSO FOCUS ON THE FACT

882
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
THAT THERE WERE CHILDREN WHO

883
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
MADE IT OUT THERE ARE HEROS.

884
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
FAMILIES CAN COME TOGETHER THE

885
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
COMMUNITY WILL BE STRONGER.

886
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
IT IS A SMALL COMMUNITY.

887
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
THEY WILL COME TOGETHER AND BE

888
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
STRONG AND TALK ABOUT THE

889
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
OUTCOME IF THERE IS A GREAT

890
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
LOSS.
GOD STILL IS IN CONTROL.

891
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
THERE ARE STILL GOOD DAYS AHEAD.

892
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
>> OUR SOCIETY HAS BECOME SO

893
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
CYNICAL VERY SECULAR.

894
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
THEY REJECT THE NOTION THAT

895
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
FAITH IS A LITTLE MORE THAN SOME

896
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
EMOTIONAL PRACTICE WE GO

897
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
THROUGH.
HOW CAN PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THERE

898
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
IS SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIVE

899
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
GOING ON FAITH AND PRAYER IS

900
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
REAL?
IT DOES EFFECT THE WAY THAT WE

901
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
LIVE AND THINK AND RELATE TO THE

902
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
TRAGEDIES OF OUR LIVES.

903
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL IT'S US

904
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
MAKING OURSELVES FEEL BETTER BY

905
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
SAYING WORDS THAT MIGHT AS WE

906
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
WILL BE ABRACADABRA.

907
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN MAKE

908
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
THEM.
ONE WAY YOU LIVE BY XAVRP.

909
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
SOMETIMES TRAGEDIES THRIVE THEM

910
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
TO KNOW THE LORD.

911
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I AM LIKE YOU ONCE YOU HAVE

912
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
TASTED WHAT IT MEANS TO FEEL THE

913
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
LORD AND YOU FEEL THE PEACE AND

914
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
STRENGTH THAT HE GIVES YOU CAN'T

915
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
TAKE THAT AWAY.

916
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PEOPLE THAT

917
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
DON'T UNDERSTAND IT WE SEE THAT

918
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
BACK IN THE BIBLE EVEN SAUL OF

919
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
TAR SUS BUT GOD KNEW HOW TO GET

920
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
HIS ATTENTION.

921
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I THINK A BIG PART OF OUR

922
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
MINISTRY IS SPREADING HOPE

923
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
SAYING GOD IS FOR YOU HE'S GOOD

924
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
AND IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO

925
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
SERVE HIM TO HONOR HIM WITH YOUR

926
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
LIFE.
IT'S NOT JUST THE GOOD TIMES BUT

927
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
THE TOUGH TIMES.

928
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
LIKE VICTORIA SAID YOU DON'T RUN

929
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
AWAY FROM GOD YOU RUN TO GOD AND

930
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
SAY GOD MY HEART IS BREAKING.

931
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN.

932
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
YOU ARE HONEST WITH GOD THAT'S

933
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
WHEN YOU SEE -- YOU WILL FEEL

934
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
GOD'S PEACE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER

935
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
FELT BEFORE.

936
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
>> I KNOW YOU BOTH SPEAK TO

937
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE EVERY WEEK

938
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
FLEW TELEVISION AND THERE AT

939
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
LAKEWOOD.
I APPRECIATE YOUR SHARING AN

940
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
ENCOURAGING MESSAGE AND A

941
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
MESSAGE OF HOPE TO ALL WHO ARE

942
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
WATCHING TONIGHT.

943
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
JOEL VICTORIA OSTEEN, GOD BLESS

944
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
YOU.

945
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
>> GOD BLESS YOU.

946
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
APPRECIATE YOU.
>> I WILL BE BACK WITH CLOSING

947
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
THOUGHTS.

948
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
>> I SAID CONTROVERSIAL THINGS

949
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
FROM TIME TO TIME BUT NONE AS

950
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
WHEN I STATED THE HORRIFIC

951
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
SHOOTING IN SCHOOLTEACHERS

952
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
COULDN'T BE BLAMED ON GOD

953
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
BECAUSE WE MARGINALIZED GOD

954
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
RIGHT OUT OF OUR CULTURE BY

955
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
REMOVING HIM FROM ALL ASPECTS OF

956
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
THE PUBLIC SQUARE.

957
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
THE VICIOUS ATTACKS THAT

958
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
RESULTED MOST ALL OF WHICH ARE

959
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
BASED ON TOTAL IGNORANCE OF WHAT

960
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I ACTUALLY SAID HAVE VALIDATED

961
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
MY POINT.

962
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
BUT I AM QUITE CERTAIN THAT WAS

963
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
NOT THE INTENT OF THE

964
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
PROFESSIONAL AND AMATEUR CRITICS

965
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
WHO DEMANDED EVERYTHING FROM MY

966
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
BEING BANNED FROM EVER SPEAKING

967
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
IN PUBLIC AGAIN OR EVEN WHO WISH

968
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
ME A SLOW AND PAINFUL DEATH.

969
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
ON THAT ALONE, I WISH TO

970
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE IT HAS

971
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
SHOWN IT DEFINES TOLERANCE AND

972
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
DIVERSITY AS BEING TOLERANT ONLY

973
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
OF THAT WITH WHICH IT AGREES AND

974
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
THE VERSE ONLY TO INCLUDE SIDE

975
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
SHADES OF THE ORTHODOX

976
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
LIBERALISM OF WHICH THEY HEAR.

977
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
THEY ABORE CENSORSHIP OF GRAPHIC

978
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
VIOLENCE BUT THE FIRST TO DEMAND

979
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
A VOICE THAT INVOKES THE NAME OF

980
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
GOD OUGHT TO BE SILENCED.

981
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
A SPECIFIC ACT OF VIOLENCE IS

982
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
RARELY THE RESULT OF A SPECIFIC

983
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
SINGLE ACT OF A CULTURE THAT

984
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
PROMPTS IT.

985
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I WOULD NEVER SAY SIMPLY TAKING

986
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
PRAYER AND BIBLE READING FROM

987
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
OUR INSTITUTIONS OR SILENCING

988
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
CHRISTMAS CAROLS IS THE DIRECT

989
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
CAUSE OF A MASS MURDER.

990
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
THAT WOULD BE LUDICROUS AND

991
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
SIMPLIST

992
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
SIMPLISTIC.
BUT THE CAUSE AND EFFECT WE SEE

993
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
AN THE CHANGES OF WHAT OUR

994
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
CHILDREN ARE CAPABLE OF IS A

995
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
PART OF A CULTURAL SHIFT FROM A

996
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
GOD CENTERED CULTURE TO A SELF

997
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
CENTERED CULTURE.

998
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
GLORIFY UNINHIBITED SIEELF

999
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
EXPRESSION AND THEN WE ARE

1000
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
SHOCKED WE HAVE A GENERATION OF

1001
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
LOAN ANOTHERS.

1002
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
WE HAVE INSISTED ON A SOCIETY

1003
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
WHERE EVERYONE GETS A TROPHY AND

1004
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
NO ONE LOSES AND THEN ACT

1005
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
SURPRISED SO MANY KIDS LACK

1006
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
SELF-ESTEEM AND FEEL LIKE

1007
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
LOSERS.
WE DISMISS THE NOTION OF NATURAL

1008
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
LAW AND THE MOTINOTION THAT THE

1009
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
ARE MORAL ABSOLUTES AND SEEM

1010
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
AMAZED WHEN SOME KIDS MAKE IT

1011
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
THEIR OWN MORALITY TO KILL

1012
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
INNOCENT CHILDREN.

1013
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
WE DIMINISH EVEN HOLD IN

1014
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
CONTEMPT THE NATURAL FAMILY OF A

1015
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
FATHER AND MOTHER CREATING AND

1016
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
RESPONSIBLY RAISING THE NEXT

1017
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
GENERATION AND THEN EXPRESS

1018
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
DISMAY THAT KIDS FEEL NO REAL

1019
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
CONNECTION TO THEIR FAMILIES OR

1020
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
EVEN THE CONCEPT OF A FAMILY.

1021
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
WE SCOFF AT THE NEED FOR MOTHERS

1022
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
AND FATHERS TO MAKE IT THEIR

1023
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
PRIORITY TO TRAIN THEIR CHILDREN

1024
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
TO BE STRONG IN SPIRIT AND SOUL

1025
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR RIGHT AND

1026
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
WRONG AND EXALT INSTEAD THE VIR

1027
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
S
DUE OF HAVING THINGS PROVIDING

1028
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
EXPENSIVE GAMES TOYS THAT

1029
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
SUBSTITUTE FOR PARENTING.

1030
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY OUR KIDS

1031
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
WOULD HAVE EAR BUDS DANGLING TO

1032
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
THE EARS FINGERS ATTACH TO DO A

1033
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
SMART PHONE AND FACE ATTACHED TO

1034
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
A COMPUTER SCREEN RATHER THAN

1035
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
HAVE EXTENDED CONVERSATION WITH

1036
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
THEIR FAMILY AT DINNER.

1037
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
WE DON'T TEACH THEM THERE'S A

1038
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
CREATOR GOD WHO SETS RULES A GOD

1039
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
WHO IS KNOWABLE AND TO WHOM WE

1040
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
ARE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE.

1041
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
WE TEACH THEM GOD WAS NOT

1042
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
INVOLVED IN OUR ORIGINS.

1043
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
OUR VERY LOIFS WERE BIOLOGICAL

1044
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
HAPPEN STANCES THOSE ARE

1045
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
DISPOSABLE SHOULD THEY BE

1046
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
INCONVENIENT.

1047
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
BEHAVIORS ARE NOT SIN BUT

1048
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
DISORDERS FOR WHICH WE OUGHT TO

1049
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
BE EX CLUED AT LEAST

1050
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
ACCOMMODAT

1051
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
ACCOMMODATED.

1052
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I REALIZE IT IS MORE OUTDATED

1053
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
AND ARCHAIC.

1054
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
IF IT WAS FROM THE SOCIAL

1055
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
CONTRACT WE GOT IN TROUBLE FOR

1056
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
SCHOOL FOR TALKING ACRASS.

1057
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
PULLING A GIRL'S PIGTAILS OR

1058
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
SLOUCHING IN HER SCHOOL DESK.

1059
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
WE TOOK GUNS TO BE SCHOOL TO BE

1060
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
SURE.
WE USED THEM BEFORE AND AFTER

1061
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
SCHOOL

1062
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
SCHOOL.
THEY WERE IN OUR TRUCKS.

1063
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HER.

1064
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I SHOULD STAND THE CONTEMPT AND

1065
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
CRITICISM.

1066
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I WILL GLAD LIE ACCEPT THEIR

1067
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
TORN WITH A DESTEADY STREAM.

1068
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I AM SOME KIND OF AN IDIOT.

1069
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
IS BUT WHEN WE AS A NATION

1070
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
FEARED GOD WE DIDN'T FEAR THAT A

1071
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
20-YEAR-OLD WITH A HIGH POWERED

1072
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
RIFLE WOULD GUN DOWN OUR

1073
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
CHILDREN IN THEIR SCHOOL ROOMS.

1074
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS MIKE

1075
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
HUCKABEE.

1076
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
IDEA FIGHNIGH

1077
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
-- GOOD NIGHT.

1078

GOD BLESS.
