SAM: DOLPHINS LIKE

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
CRUNCH HERE ARE PLAYFUL

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
AND INTELLIGENT ANIMALS,

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
BUT THEY DO HAVE COMPLEX

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
SOCIAL STRUCTURES,

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
INCLUDING SOMETHING

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
CALLED MALE COALITIONS.

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
THAT'S WHEN TWO MALE

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
DOLPHINS FORM A

10
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
LONG-LASTING BOND.

11
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
IN THIS SEA RESCUE, A

12
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
DOLPHIN TURNS UP

13
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
SEVERELY INJURED ON

14
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
FLORIDA'S ATLANTIC

15
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
COAST, AND THAT BOND

16
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
BETWEEN TWO DOLPHINS IS

17
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
ABOUT TO BE PUT TO THE

18
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
TEST.

19
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
IT'S A SWELTERING AUGUST

20
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
DAY IN VERO BEACH,

IN DISTRESS.

25
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE A

26
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
STRAIGHTFORWARD CASE,

27
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
BUT NONE OF THEM HAVE

28
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
ANY IDEA THEY'RE ABOUT

29
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
TO MEET AN ANIMAL THAT

30
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
WILL TEACH THEM A

31
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
LIFE-CHANGING LESSON.

32
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
JON: ABOUT MID-DAY, WE

DOLPHIN THAT WAS OVER IN

35
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
INDIAN RIVER THAT
SOUNDED LIKE A BOAT

36
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
STRIKE.

37
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
SAM: A BADLY-INJURED

HIMSELF IN A WARM-WATER

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
INLET.

41
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
IT'S FAR AWAY FROM OPEN

42
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
WATERS DOLPHINS NORMALLY

43
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000

SAM: SEAWORLD ASSEMBLES

50

MAN: WE CAN USE SOME

59
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
ROPE, TOO.

THE SPOT WHERE THE

64
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
DOLPHIN WAS LAST SEEN.

65
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
JON: WHEN THE SEAWORLD

66
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
RESCUE TEAM GOT TO THE

67
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000

IT HAD ALREADY SWAM OFF.SAMD

70
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
SAM: THEY FIND A POD OF

71
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
DOLPHINS IN THE LAGOON,

72
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
BUT THEY DON'T SEE AN

73
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
INJURED ONE.

74
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
WOMAN: CALF OVER HERE.

75
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
YEAH, BEHIND YOU.

76
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
JON: WE HAD BOATS GOING

77
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A LITTLE BIT OF

78
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
EVERYWHERE LOOKING.

79
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
AFTER A LITTLE BIT OF

80
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
TIME, WE ACTUALLY FOUND

81
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
THE ANIMAL.

82
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
AT THIS POINT, IT WAS

83
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
TIME TO TRY TO RESCUE

84
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
IT.

85
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
SAM: THEY SET NETS, BUT

86
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
EVEN THOUGH THIS DOLPHIN

87
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
IS SERIOUSLY INJURED,

88
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
HE'S STILL ABLE TO
OUT-SWIM THE RESCUE

89
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
EFFORTS OVER AND OVER

90
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
AGAIN.

91
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
WOMAN: OH, HE'S OUT!

92
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
JON: YOU CIRCLE THE

93
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
ANIMAL WITH THE BOAT AND

94
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
TRY TO PUT A NET AROUND

95
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
IT, AND EVERY TIME WE

96
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
DID, THE DOL

97
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
SHOW UP OUTSIDE THE NET.

98
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
HE'D EITHER SWIM UNDER

99
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
IT, HE'D SWIM AROUND IT,

100
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
HE'D BE FASTER THAN US;

101
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
AND FOR AN ANIMAL THAT'S

102
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
INJURED TO BE FASTER

103
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
THAN OUR BOATS, IT'S NOT.

104
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
SAM: RESCUERS ARE NO
CLOSER TO SAVING OUR

105
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
DOLPHIN, AND NOW IT'S

106
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
GETTING DARK.

107
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
THAT MAKES THE RESCUE

108
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
EFFORT DANGEROUS.

109
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
THEY MAKE THE DIFFICULT

110
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
DECISION TO RETURN TO

111
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
LAND, WAITING FOR

112
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
DAYBREAK, BUT THERE IS

113
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
NO GUARANTEE THE DOLPHIN

114
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
WILL SURVIVE THE NIGHT.

115
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
JON: AS WE WERE DRIVING

116
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
BACK, THE DOLPHIN POPPED

117
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
UP RIGHT NEXT TO THE
BOAT, RIGHT OFF THE

118
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
FRONT OF THE BOAT, AND

119
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
IT WAS JUST A PERFECT

120
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
OPPORTUNITY.

121
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
SAM: RESCUERS JUMP IN TO

122
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
HELP CORRAL THE DOLPHIN

123
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
INTO THE NET.

124
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
NOW THEY FACE A NEW SET

125
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
JON: WE'VE GOT SHARKS,

126
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
WE'VE GOT STINGRAYS,

127
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
WE'VE GOT DEEP WATER,

128
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
CURRENTS, OTHER BOATS

129
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
THAT ARE COMING AROUND.

130
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
SO, AS SOON AS WE GET IN

131
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
THE WATER, WE WANT TO

132
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
WORK VERY SAFELY, BUT WE

133
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
WANT TO WORK VERY

134
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
QUICKLY TO GET THAT

135
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
ANIMAL IN HAND AND GET

136
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
HIM BACK ON THE BACK OF

137
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
THE BOAT.

138
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
SAM: OUR DOLPHIN IS

139
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
FINALLY IN THE NET, BUT

140
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
RESCUERS HAVE TO MAKE NOT EE

141
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
SURE HE DOES NOT ESCAPE

142
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
UNDER THE BOAT, SO THEY

143
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
TAP THE WATER.

144
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
IT'S A TECHNIQUE THEY

145
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
USE TRYING TO KEEP HIM

146
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
WHERE HE NEEDS TO BE.

147
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
MAN: HEY, WHAT WE'RE

148
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
GOING TO HAVE TO DO IS

149
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
GET HIM IN THE

150
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
STRETCHER, AND GET HIM
UP, AND THEN GET THE NET

151
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
OFF TO THE SIDE.
MAN: YEAH, WE CAN DO

152
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
THAT.

153
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
SAM: WITH SOLID
TEAMWORK, THEY PULL THE

154
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
INJURED DOLPHIN ABOARD.

155
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
MAN: ON THREE.

156
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
ONE, TWO, THREE, GO.

157
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
ONE MORE.

158
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'VE GOT SOME WATER.

159
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
ONE MORE TIME, TWO,

160
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THREE.

161
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
WATCH HIS FLUKE.

162
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
SAM: AND ARE SHOCKED BY

163
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
WHAT THEY SEE.

164
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
JON: WE FOUND OUT IT
WASN'T A BOAT STRIKE AT

165
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
ALL.

166
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
IT WAS ACTUALLY A SHARK

167
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
BITE RIGHT DOWN THE

168
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
CENTER OF HIS BACK.

169
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
DR. DOLD: SHARK BITES

170
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
FOR ANY ANIMAL,

171
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
SPECIFICALLY BOTTLENOSE
DOLPHINS, ARE A SERIOUS

172
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
INJURY AND NOTHING TO BE

173
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
TAKEN LIGHTLY.

174
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
REMEMBER, WHEN SHARKS
REMEMBER

175
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
BITE, THEY CAUSE A LOT

176
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
OF TISSUE DAMAGE.

177
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
IN ALL THE TIME I'VE

178
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
WORKED AT SEAWORLD AND

179
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
RESCUED ANIMALS, I'VE

180
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
NEVER SEEN A WOUND THAT

181
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
WAS THIS LARGE MADE BY

182
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
ANOTHER ANIMAL.

183
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
IT'S PHENOMENAL THAT THE

184
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
ANIMAL IS STILL ALIVE.

185
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
SAM: HIS WOUNDS ARE SO

186
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
SEVERE, OUR DOLPHIN

187
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
COULD GO INTO SHOCK

188
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
DURING TRANSPORT.

189
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
RESCUERS RACE THE

571
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
EATING MORE, FUELING HIS

575
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
HE'S GOT MORE ENERGY,

576
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
BUT HE HAS ONE BIZARRE

577
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
HABIT.

578
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000

NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN 40

583

YEARS.

584
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
C6 WOULD ACTUALLY SINK

585
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000

THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL,

587
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000

APPEARANCE THAT HE HAD
DROWNED.

589
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
MAN: THAT'S HOW HE
RESTS.

590
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
STEVE: WHEN WE FIRST
OBSERVED IT, IT WAS

591
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
QUITE A START.

592

THIS WAS A NICE REMINDER

597
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
OF THE FACT THAT

598
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
BEHAVIORS WE DON'T

599

600
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
ALWAYS INDICATIVE OFA

MEDICAL TREATMENT, AND

610
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
HE BECAME STRONGER.

611
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
LIFE IN THE WILD ISN'T
EASY, AND C6 NEEDED TO

612
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
BE IN TOP SHAPE.

613
