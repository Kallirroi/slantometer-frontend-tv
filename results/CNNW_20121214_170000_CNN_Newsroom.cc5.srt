00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
THEY WANT TO TALK TO ANYONE

189
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000

POLICE ALSO JUST AS WE ARE

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000

191
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
A HANDLE ON EXACTLY WHAT HAS

192
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
HAPPENED THERE.

193
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
IT LOOKS LIKE THE HELICOPTER

194
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
PICTURES ARE HAVING FREEZE-UP.
THAT'S A SHOT OF THE FIREHOUSE

195

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
LABEL THAT SAYS DICKINSON DRIVE

200
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000

201
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000

202
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000

SIGH THAT LONG DRIVEWAY.

206
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
THERE'S THE FIREHOUSE AND THE

207
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000

209
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
THAT'S WHERE POLICE HAVE BEEN

210
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
A NEWS CONFERENCE.

213
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
THAT TIME MAY BE MORE FLUID.

214
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
THEY'RE GOING ABOUT TWO MILES

215
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
AWAY, AND THEY REALIZE THAT THE

216
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000

217
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
KNOW AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE,

218
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
ESPECIALLY PARENTS.

219
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
A REVERSE 911 CALL WENT OUT TO

220
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
THE RESIDENTS OF NEWTOWN

221
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000

222
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
SHOOTING AT SANDY HOOK

223
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000

THE DANBURY TIMES IS REPORTING

224
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000

228
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
HAS DIED AS A RESULT OF THIS

229
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000

244
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000

245
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
PARENTS JUST SHOWED UP HERE, OF

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
SECURE THE SCENE OVER AT THE

254
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
AT LEAST SEVERAL PEOPLE SHOT.

256
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
PARENTS ARE GETTING INFORMATION

257
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
FROM EMERGENCY OFFICIALS THAT

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
THE PRINCIPAL.

259
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
WE'RE TRYING TO CONFIRM THAT.

260
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
STATE POLICE ARE STAGING AN AREA

261
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000

OF COURSE, WE WILL BE AT THAT

269

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
AS WE WERE SHOWING UP, A LOT OF

274
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
PARENTS WALKED OUT WITH THEIR

275
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
CHILDREN, VERY YOUNG CHILDREN,

276
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
THIRD, FOURTH GRADERS.

277
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
THEY WERE, OF COURSE, VERY

278
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
EMOTIONAL.

279
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
A LOT WERE CRYING.

280
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000

WALKED INTO THE CLASSROOM AND

283
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
SHOT THE TEACHER.

284
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
THAT'S JUST SOME OF THE

285
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000

WE ASKED THAT PARENT HOW YOUR

286
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
CHILD IS DOING.

287
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
HE WAS RUNNING UP THE STREET

288
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
SAYING, I DON'T KNOW AT THAT THE

289
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
POINT.
THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE

290
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000

291
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000

SELF-INFLICTED OR HE WAS SHOT

318
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000

LIZ, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?

354
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
>> I WAS BRINGING MY SON, DEVIN,

355
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
TO SCHOOL WHEN ALL THE POLICE

356
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
CARS AND EMERGENCY VEHICLES WERE

357
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
DRIVING BY.

358
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
SO MY GUT TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE

359
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
HEADED TO THE SCHOOL, AND WE

360
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
DROVE DOWN AND CONFIRMED THAT
THEY WERE HEADED TO THE SCHOOL.

361
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
THEY WERE SURROUNDING A DARK SUV

362
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
OR VAN WITH A TOOELE ON TOP, AND

363
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
THERE WAS A STRANGE BURNING
SMELL AND WE LEFT.

364
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
WE WENT HOME.

365
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
ON THE WAY WE LEARNED THAT THERE

366
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
WAS A SHOOTING AT THE SCHOOL.

367
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
THE SCHOOL PUTS OUT A BLAST, SO

368
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I DIDN'T BRING MY SON TO HIS

369
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
SCHOOL, THE HIGH SCHOOL.

370
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
WE JUST WENT HOME WHERE FRIENDS

WHEN SHE HEARD THOSE GUNSHOTS

554
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
BEFORE THERE WAS SILENCE?

555
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
>> WELL, SHE SAID SHE WAS

556
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
THERE -- SHE SAID SHE GOT THERE

557
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
AT 9:00 -- SHE SAID THE MEETING

558
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
STARTED AT 9:00, 9:30.

559
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE FEELS LIKE IT

560
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
WAS RIGHT AT THE START OF THE

561
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
MEETING, SO SHE SAID AROUND

562
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
9:30, 9:35 THEY STARTED TO HEAR

563
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
THE POP, POP, POP IN THE HALL.

564
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE KNEW WHAT IT

565
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
WAS.
I ASKED HER, I SAID, A LOT OF

566
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT'S WHAT

567
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
THEY'RE HEARING, GUNSHOTS.

568
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
WE ALL KNEW SOMETHING WAS FIRED

569
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
IN THE HALL, AND THREE PEOPLE

570
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
WENT OUT AND ONLY ONE PERSON

571
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
CAME BACK.

572
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
SO THAT MEETING STARTED AT 9:30,

573
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
AND SHE'S STILLED LOCKED DOWN IN

574
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
THE SCHOOL.
>> DOES SHE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW

575
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
LONG A TIME THAT WAS WHEN SHE

576
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
WAS HEARING ALL OF THAT POPPING

577
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
NOISE, ALL THAT GUNFIRE?

578
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
>> NO.

579
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
NO.

580
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
SHE SAID IT WENT -- IT WENT --

581
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
IT WENT QUICKLY, AND THEN SHE

582
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
SAID ALTERNATIVELY, YOU KNOW, IT

583
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
WAS 100 ROUNDS THAT WENT ON

584
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
SEEMINGLY FOREVER.

585
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
>> WAS THERE ANYONE TREATING THE

586
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
PRINCIPAL AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST

587
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
WHEN THEY WERE IN THE HALLWAY?

588
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
>> SHE DIDN'T MENTION THAT.

589
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
>> DID SHE SEE ANYBODY WHO MIGHT

590
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
HAVE BEEN COMING TO THEIR AID,

591
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
OR WERE THEY JUST ESCORTED,

592
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
WALKED PAST THE TWO BODIES?

593
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
>> I BELIEVE, SUZANNE, SHE SAID

594
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
THAT SHE SAW A STRETCHER OR

595
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
SOMEONE COMING TO THEIR AID.

596
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I THINK SHE MENTIONED SOME KIND

597
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
OF ASSISTANCE, BUT AGAIN, SHE

598
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
WAS -- HER MAIN FOCUS AT THIS

599
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
POINT WAS REALLY TO TRY TO TELL

600
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
THE STORY OF THEY WERE THERE IN

601
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
THAT ROOM, SEVEN PEOPLE, AND

602
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
WHAT HAPPENED AND HOW SHE WENT

603
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
UNDER THE TABLE AND CALLED 911.

604
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
THREE PEOPLE OUT, AND ONLY ONE

605
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
CAME BACK.

606
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
THAT WAS THE GIST OF THE STORY.

607
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
>> DID SHE DESCRIBE AT ALL,

608
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
MEREDITH, WHAT IT WAS LIKE, THE

609
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
SCENE?
WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS CALM OR

610
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
CHAOTIC WHEN THEY WERE USHERED

611
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
OUT OF THE ROOM AND OUT OF THE

612
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
SCHOOL?
>> NO, SHE DIDN'T DESCRIBE IT AS

613
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
EITHER CALM OR KAY YOT ITTCHAOT.

614
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
WHEN I ASKED HER WHAT IT WAS

615
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
LIKE, SHE SAID THEY'RE JUST

616
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
TRYING -- I ASKED IF THERE WERE

617
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
ANY MESSAGES GOING OVER THE LOUD

618
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
SPEAKER, IF THERE'S -- OF WHAT'S

619
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
BEING SAID.
SHE SAID THERE'S NOTHING LIKE

620
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
THAT HAPPENING INSIDE THE SCHOOL

621
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
RIGHT NOW.

622
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
SHE SAID EVERYONE IS STILL ON

623
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
LOCKDOWN.

624
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
SO IT'S -- SO IT SOUNDS LIKE

625
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
THEY'RE KEEPING PEOPLE, YOU

626
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
KNOW, WHERE THEY ARE.

627
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
SHE SAID THERE ARE STILL
CHILDREN IN CLASSROOMS HERE.

628
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
>> MEREDITH ARTLEY, THANK YOU SO

629
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
MUCH.

630
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I APPRECIATE IT.
>> THANKS, SUZANNE.

631
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
>> WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET IN

632
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
TOUCH WITH SOME PEOPLE INCLUDING

633
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
THE WOMAN YOU SPOKE TO WHO

634
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
EXPERIENCED JUST A HARROWING

635
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
EXPERIENCE, THOSE SEVEN PEOPLE

636
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
INSIDE OF A ROOM HEARING THE

637
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
GUNFIRE AND THEN HAVING TO WALK

638
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
PAST THOSE WHO WERE SHOT IN THE

639
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
HALLWAY.
I WANT TO GO BACK TO OUR

640
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
AAFFILIATE, WFSB, FOR MORE

641
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
DETAILS.

642
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
>> I WONDER IF THAT PERSON WAS

643
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
INVOLVED.
THAT PERSON WAS TAKEN TO A

644
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
POLICE CAR.

645
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE THAT PERSON

646
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
IS AT THIS POINT, AND AGAIN, WE

647
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
DO NOT KNOW IF THERE WAS ONE

648
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
SHOOTER OR MORE SHOOTERS.

649
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
THAT WILL ALL BEING SORTED OUT,

650
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I THINK.
THEY WERE TRYING TO SECURE THIS

651
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
AREA.
THEY WERE ALLOWING US A LOT

652
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
CLOSER, BUT NOW AS THEY'VE

653
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
SECURED THE AREA, THEY'RE

654
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
EXPANDING THE ZONE AS THIS

655
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
INVESTIGATION BEGINS.

656
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
OF COURSE, WE HAVE THIS OTHER
INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE TRYING

657
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
TO TRACK A VAN, AND THEY MAY

658
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
HAVE AN AREA OVER IN DANBURY

659
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
THAT THEY HAVE THAT VAN.

660
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
SO WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A CREW OVER

661
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
THERE AS WELL, BUT I THINK THE

662
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
MAIN INFORMATION RIGHT NOW IS

663
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
COMING FROM A NEWS CONFERENCE

664
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
WITHIN THE NEXT HALF HOUR.

665
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
CARA.

666
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
>> THANK YOU, ROBERT.

667
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
>> ROBERT, WE APPRECIATE IT.

668
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
OBVIOUSLY, WE'LL STAY ON THERE

669
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
AND BRING YOU THAT INFORMATION

670
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
AS SOON AS THAT PRESS CONFERENCE

671
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
BEGINS.

672
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
WE'LL TAKE THAT LIVE FROM

673
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
NEWTOWN.

674
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN

675
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
NEWTOWN, A K TO 4 SCHOOL WITH

676
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
ABOUT 600 STUDENTS, THE SCENE OF

677
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
A SHOOTING THIS MORNING.

ONE CHILD CONFIRMED DEAD, THE

GUNMAN DEAD AS WELL.

680
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
AT LEAST ONE OTHER PERSON WAS

681
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
SHOT, ALTHOUGH POLICE SAY THAT

682
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
THEY DO BELIEVE THAT THERE MAY

683
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
BE OTHER VICTIMS INVOLVED IN

684
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
THIS.
AT THIS POINT THE SCHOOL IS

685
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY POLICE

686
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
9:41 THIS MORNING, ABOUT THREE

690
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
HOURS AGO, THAT CALL CAME IN

691
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000

697
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
YOU CAN SEE THE AMBULANCES

698
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
THERE.
AN ENORMOUS RESPONSE TO THAT

699
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
SCHOOL, AND WE DID HEAR REPORTS

700
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
WCBS REPORTING THAT THE

701
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
FIREFIGHTERS WERE HELPING TO

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
ESCORT CHILDREN OUT OF THE

703
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
SCHOOL.
THEY WERE TELLING THOSE CHILDREN

704
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
TO COVER THEIR EYES AND RUN AS

705
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
THEY WENT BY THE SCHOOL OFFICE.

706
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
OBVIOUSLY AN OMINOUS WARNING

707
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
HERE.
THIS IS A PICTURE FROM THE

708
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000

710
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
YOU CAN SEE THE HUGE GLUT THE

711
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
VEHICLES THAT CAME IN THERE AS

712
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
PEOPLE CAME TRYING TO GET

713
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
INFORMATION.
>> VERY CHAOTIC AND HORRIFYING

714
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
SCENE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

715
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
CHILDREN IN THAT SCHOOL.

716
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
REPRESENTATIVE JOHN FRAY IS

723
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
WITNESSED FIRST GRADERS RUNNING

724
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
FROM THE SCHOOL CRYING.

725
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
SHE AMONG OTHER PEOPLE TOOK

726
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
THOSE CHILDREN, AND PEOPLE HAVE

727
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
BEEN ASSEMBLING AT THE

728
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
FIREHOUSE.
HERE WE SEE THE PICTURES OF

729
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
ADULTS AND PRESUMABLY TEACHERS

730
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
TAKING AWAY DISTRAUGHT CHILDREN

731
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
AND WALKING THEM TO A SAFER

732
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
PLACE.
ROBERT TOLD US THAT MANY

733
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
CHILDREN HAVE REUNITED WITH

734
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
FAMILIES, BUT THEY ARE REMAINING

735
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000

IS NEWS 12 CONNECTICUT.

1111
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
THIS IS ROB REPORTING.

1112
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
YOU SEE AERIAL SHOTS OVERLOOKING

1113
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
THE SCHOOL.

1114
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
CNN CAN INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRM

1115
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
THAT THE SHOOTER IS DEAD AND AT

1116
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
LEAST TWO EMPLOYEES OF THE

1117
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
SCHOOL HAVE BEEN KILLED.

1118
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
WE WANT TO DIP INTO THE RAW

1119
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
COVERAGE FROM OUR AFFILIATE.

1120
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
WE CAN'T CONFIRM THE RAW LIVE

1121
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
REPORTING THAT THEY ARE DOING,

1122
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
BUT WE WANT TO GET A GOOD LOOK

1123
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
ON THE GROUND AND GET A SENSE OF

1124
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING.

1125
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
>> IT SEEMS AS IF THAT SCENE HAS

1126
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
QUIETED DOWN NOW.

1127
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
THAT IS THE VEHICLE THAT THEY

1128
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN, THAT

1129
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
BLACK HONDA.

1130
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
IT WAS TAPED OFF VERY EARLY ON

1131
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
IN THE WHOLE INCIDENT, AND YOU

1132
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
CAN SEE A POLICE DOG TAKEN OVER

1133
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
TO THE CAR.

1134
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
THIS IS FOOTAGE FROM EARLIER

1135
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
TODAY.
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

1136
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A SCENT, AND

1137
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
THERE IS A REPORT FROM ANOTHER

1138
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
TELEVISION STATION IN

1139
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
CONNECTICUT THAT TWO GUNMEN WERE

1140
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
INVOLVED, AND ONE WAS LED AWAY

1141
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
IN HANDCUFFS.

1142
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
>> SO THE EARLY REPORT OF TWO

1143
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
GUNMEN AND THEN NOW WITH -- THE

1144
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
ABC AFFILIATE REPORTING THAT

1145
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
THAT -- THAT OTHER SECOND GUNMAN

1146
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
TAKEN AWAY IN HANDCUFFS.

1147
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
AT THIS POINT ALL THE

1148
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
INFORMATION WE'VE RECEIVED IS

1149
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
THAT THE SHOOTER -- THE FATALITY

1150
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
WAS AN ADULT.

1151
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF --

1152
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
>> BUT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL

1153
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
REPORTS FROM OTHER STATIONS,

1154
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
OTHER NEWS ORGANIZATIONS SAYING

1155
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
AS MANY AS 20 CHILDREN MAY HAVE

1156
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
BEEN SHOT.
>> I'M TALKING ABOUT THE GUNMAN,

1157
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
THOUGH.

1158
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
>> THIS HAS GOTTEN SO MUCH WORSE

1159
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
AS WE'VE BEEN COVERING IT SINCE

1160
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
WE'VE BEEN ON A COUPLE OF HOURS.

1161
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
>> LET'S GO TO JAY CARNEY AT THE

1162
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING.

1163
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE SHOOTING.

1164
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
>> WE'LL BEGIN TO INVESTIGATE

1165
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
THIS INCIDENT.

1166
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
AS I SAID, THE PRESIDENT WILL

1167
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
RECEIVE REGULAR UPDATES AS THE

1168
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
DAY PROGRESSES.

1169
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
WE'LL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS.

1170
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
>> JAY, ONE FOLLOW-UP ON THAT.

1171
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
CAN YOU RELAY TO US ANY OF THE

1172
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
PRESIDENT'S REACTIONS OR

1173
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
THOUGHTS?

1174
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
OBVIOUSLY, ALL OF SHOOTINGS ARE

1175
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
TRAGIC.

1176
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
WE'RE HEARING PARTICULARLY

1177
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
HEINOUS NUMBERS WHERE CHILDREN

1178
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
ARE INVOLVED.

1179
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
>> I WOULD RATHER NOT RELAY

1180
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
REACTIONS AT THIS POINT, BECAUSE

1181
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I DON'T HAVE ANY CONFIRMATION TO

1182
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
GIVE TO YOU ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY

1183
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
HAS HAPPENED THERE OR POTENTIAL

1184
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
VICTIMS.
AT THIS POINT I'D RATHER JUST

1185
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
INFORM YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT

1186
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
HAS BEEN INFORMED ABOUT THE

1187
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
SHOOTING, WAS INFORMED AT 10:30

1188
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
AND IS BEING GIVEN REGULAR

1189
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
UPDATES AS MORE INFORMATION IS

1190
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
AVAILABLE.
>> WILL WE HEAR FROM HIM TODAY?

1191
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
>> WE'LL HAVE TO KEEP YOU

1192
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
UPDATED AS MORE INFORMATION

1193
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
BECOMES AVAILABLE.

1194
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
>> Reporter: TWO OTHER TOPICS.

1195
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
IN THE ABC NEWS INTERVIEW THE

1196
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT THE

1197
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA IN A

1198
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
COUPLE OF STATES WHERE VOTERS

1199
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
HAVE SOUNDED OFF ON THAT AND

1200
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
ESSENTIALLY SAID THAT IT'S NOT A

1201
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
HIGH PRIORITY FOR HIM, NO PUN

1202
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
INTENDED, TO GO AFTER

1203
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
RECREATIONAL USERS.

1204
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A SERIOUS

1205
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
ISSUE.
STATES RIGHTS VERSUS FEDERAL

1206
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
RIGHTS.
I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY

1207
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
CONCERN --
>> THEY WERE LOOKING FOR

1208
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
APPARENTLY ANOTHER SHOOTER.

1209
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE

1210
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
WERE INVOLVED.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN

1211
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
INFORMED OF THE SHOOTING BY HIS

1212
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
STAFF.
HAPPENED ABOUT 10:30 OR SO THIS

1213
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
MORNING.

1214
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
IT IS TYPICAL THAT AT A SCENE

1215
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
LIKE THIS, A SITUATION THAT THE

1216
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
PRESIDENT WOULD BE INFORMED

1217
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
RATHER QUICKLY.

1218
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
THAT HE WOULD BE GETTING REGULAR

1219
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
UPDATES FROM HIS STAFF, AND AT

1220
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
SOME POINT DEPENDING ON HOW

1221
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
SERIOUS THE SITUATION IS, HE

1222
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
SAID CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT

1223
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
WOULD RELEASE A STATEMENT AND

1224
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
EVEN PERHAPS COME OUT PUBLICLY

1225
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
TO ADDRESS WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE

1226
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
IN THINGS OF THIS NATURE.

1227
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
A NATIONAL TRAGEDY OF THIS

1228
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
NATURE.
I WANT TO DIP BACK INTO NEWS 12

1229
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
CONNECTICUT, OUR AFFILIATE, TO

1230
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
LISTEN TO SOME OF THE THINGS

1231
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
THEY'RE HEARING.

1232
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
>> TAKEN TO DANBURY HOSPITAL.

1233
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
THE SHOOTER FOR THE MOST PART

1234
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
HAS BEEN CONFIRMED.

1235
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
THE APPARENT SHOOTER IS DEAD, AN

1236
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
ADULT.
TWO HANDGUNS, TWO 9 MILLIMETER

1237
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
GUNS RECOVERED.

1238
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
STUDENTS SENT RUNNING FROM THIS

1239
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
SCHOOL.
WE HEARD COLLEEN POUNDSTONE, WHO

1240
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
LIVES THREE HOUSES AWAY SAYING

1241
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
CHILDREN WERE RUNNING IN THE

1242
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
FIELDS, WHICH ESSENTIALLY IS HER

1243
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
BACKYARD.

1244
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
ONE LITTLE BOY SAYING I JUST

1245
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
WANT TO GO HOME.

1246
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
SUCH A DISTURBING SCENE, BUT

1247
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
UNFOLDING SO QUICKLY THIS

1248
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
MORNING.
AS THOUGH STUDENTS ARE MAKING

1249
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
THEIR WAY TO THE SANDY HOOK

1250
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT, WHICH

1251
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
IS NOT VERY FAR FROM THE SCHOOL.

1252
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
>> NO.
YOU'VE BEEN SEEING IT.

1253
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
WE'LL POINT IT AGAIN.

1254
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
IT'S JUST TO THE RIGHT OF THAT

1255
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
FACILITY, WHICH IS THE SCHOOL,

1256
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
IS THE VOLUNTEER FIRE

1257
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
DEPARTMENT, WHICH IS WHERE THE

1258
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
ALL THE KIDS WERE LED, THOSE

1259
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
THAT DIDN'T FLEE ON THEIR OWN.

1260
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
THEY WERE MARCHED OVER THERE IN

1261
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
LINE.

1262
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
WE ACTUALLY HAD A PICTURE

1263
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
EARLIER OF THAT, OF THE KIDS

1264
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
ARMED ON EACH OTHER'S SHOULDERS

1265
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
WALKING IN A LINE.

1266
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
THAT'S WHERE THEY WERE TAKEN AND

1267
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
THAT'S WHERE PARENTS WENT TO

1268
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
MEET THEIR KIDS AND TAKE THEM

1269
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
HOME.

1270
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
WE THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS GOING

1271
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
GOOD.
AS THE STORY UNFOLDED IT SOUNDED

1272
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
LIKE THE SHOOTER WAS SHOT AND

1273
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
THEN POSSIBLY ONE OTHER PERSON.

1274
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
NOW THIS HORRIBLE MOUNTING DEATH

1275
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
TOLL INVOLVING SO MANY CHILDREN

1276
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
AND ADULTS.

1277
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
IT DOES GIVE ONE PAUSE.

1278
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
>> YES.
BUT FEDERAL AUTHORITIES, AS WE

1279
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
HEARD EARLIER FROM THE ASSISTANT

1280

NOW EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ARE SO

1282
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
CAREFULLY CHOREOGRAPHED TODAY.

IN THIS.

1288
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
AT WHAT POINT I'M NOT CLEAR.

1289
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
>> THE FBI HAS BEEN ON THE

1290
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000

OF KIDS IS UNACCOUNTED FOR

1298
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.

1299
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
>> BUT THAT MAY BE THE KIDS

1300
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
FLEEING THROUGH THE WOODS.

1301
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
>> THAT RAN ON THEIR OWN.

1302
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
>> RIGHT.

1303
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000

1304
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000

00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
POLICE COMBING THROUGH THE WOODS

1366
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
IN THAT AREA.

1367
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
SHE WAS THE WIFE OF A MILITARY

1368
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
MAN, AND SHE HAD MANY BRIEFINGS

1369
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000

PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED AT THE

WE DO KNOW THAT THE SUSPECTED

1387
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
SHOOTER'S BODY WAS DISCOVERED IN

1388
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
A CLASSROOM, BUT WE DO NOT KNOW

1389
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
HOW THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER DIED,

1390
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
WHETHER IT WAS BY HIS OWN HAND

1391
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
OR BY POLICE OR IN SOME OTHER

1392
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000

00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
WAITING FOR, AND THERE IS A NEWS

00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000

1401
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000

CHILDREN.

1407
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000

1409
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
SUSAN, DO WE HAVE A SENSE IN

00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE THAT IS
GOING TO OCCUR IN ABOUT TEN

1411
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
MINUTES OR SO WHETHER OR NOT

1412
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
THAT NUMBER COULD BE EVEN

1413
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
HIGHER?
>> Reporter: I AM HEARING THAT

1414
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
THAT MAY BE THE CASE.

1415
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
WE ALSO HAVE ACCORDING TO

1416
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
ANOTHER SOURCE THAT THE PASCHOO

1417
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
PRINCIPAL WAS AMONG THOSE KILLED

1418
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
AS WELL.

1419
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
YES.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, HERE AT THE

1420
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
SITE WE VERY RECENTLY SAW

1421
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
FEDERAL, LOCAL OFFICIALS AS

1422
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
WELL, LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS

1423
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
WITH GUNS AT THEIR SIDE

1424
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
SEARCHING -- CONTINUING TO

1425
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
SEARCH THE AREA AROUND THE

1426
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
SCHOOL

1427
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
THEY APPEAR TO BE LOOKING AT

1428
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
VARIOUS CARS.

1429
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE

1430
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE

1431
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
SPECIFICALLY, BUT WE KNOW FROM

1432
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
EARLIER INFORMATION WE HAD THAT

1433
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
PROTECTIVELY THEY CONTINUED TO

1434
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
LOOK THROUGH THE AREA TO MAKE

1435
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
SURE THAT EVERYONE CONNECTED TO

1436
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
THE SHOOTING WAS FOUND.

1437
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
STILL NO KIND OF MOTIVE HAS BEEN

1438
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
REVEALED AT THIS TIME.

1439
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
>> SUSAN, IS THERE ANY SENSE

1440
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
FROM THOSE WHO YOU'RE SPEAKING

1441
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
WITH WHETHER OR NOT THOSE WHO

1442
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
WERE TRAGICALLY KILLED, IF THIS

1443
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
TOOK PLACE IN ONE PARTICULAR

1444
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
PART OF THE SCHOOL?

1445
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
COULD IT HAVE BEEN ONE CLASSROOM

1446
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
OR SOMETHING WHERE THEY BELIEVE

1447
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
THE GUNMAN WENT FROM CLASS TO

1448
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
CLASS?
>> Reporter: WE JUST DON'T KNOW.

1449
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
IT'S TOO EARLY.

1450
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
OF COURSE, THOSE ARE AMONG THE

1451
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
DETAILS THAT WE HOPE TO LEARN AS

1452
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
WELL AS WHO THE SHOOTER WAS,

1453
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
WHAT THE CONNECTION WAS, IF ANY,

1454
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
BETWEEN THE SHOOTER AND THE

1455
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
SCHOOL.

1456
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
THOSE ARE AMONG SO MANY

1457
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
QUESTIONS THAT WE ALL HAVE RIGHT

1458
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
NOW.
>> DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF

1459
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
WHETHER OR NOT THE PARENTS OF

1460
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
THESE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN

1461
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
NOTIFIED ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN?

1462
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
>> Reporter: NO INFORMATION

1463
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
ABOUT THAT EITHER.

1464
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
WE DO KNOW THAT WHEN A LOT OF

1465
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
CHILDREN WERE LET OUT OF THE

1466
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
SCHOOL, AND I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN

1467
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
THE PICTURES OF THEM IN A LINE

1468
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
WITH HANDS ON EACH OTHER'S

1469
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
SHOULDER OF THE CHILD IN FRONT

1470
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
OF THEM THAT ONE OF THE STAGING

1471
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
AREAS IS A NEARBY FIREHOUSE.

1472
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN SOME CHILDREN

1473
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
AND PARENTS IN THE VICINITY OF

1474
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
THE SCHOOL ALSO WALKING ABOUT

1475
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
NOT ON THE SCHOOL SITE.

1476
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
IN ANY CASE WE ARE SURE AS THEY

1477
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
HAVE DONE IN SO MANY CASES PRIOR

1478
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
TO THIS TRYING TO GET COUNSELING

1479
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
AVAILABLE FOR CHILDREN AS SOON

1480
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
AS POSSIBLE.
>> I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE FEAR

1481
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
AND CONCERN WHEN PEOPLE HEAR

1482
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
THESE NUMBERS.

1483
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
IS THERE ANY SENSE OF A PROCESS

1484
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
OR SOME SORT OF WAY OF GETTING

1485
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
INFORMATION TO PEOPLE, TO

1486
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
PARENTS AND TO CHILDREN ABOUT

1487
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
THE STATE OF THEIR LOVED ONES IN

1488
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
THAT SCHOOL?

1489
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

1490
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
WHAT KIND OF PROCESS THEY HAVE

1491
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
SET UP OR SYSTEM THAT THEY SET

1492
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
UP HERE FOR THE CHILDREN.

1493
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
OF COURSE, THE POLICE WERE ON

1494
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
THE SCENE VERY QUICKLY.

1495
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
THEY HAVE BEEN MAKING SURE THAT

1496
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
THEY WERE SHUTTLING THE CHILDREN

1497
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
TO A SAFE LOCATION, AND I'M SURE

1498
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
AMONG MANY THINGS THEY ARE DOING

1499
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
IS TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION TO

1500
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
THE PARENTS AS IS POSSIBLE, BUT

1501
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE

1502
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
DETAILS YET EITHER.
WE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE A SHORT

1503
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
TIME AGO, SO WE TRY TO CONTINUE

1504
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
TO GET THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU.

1505
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE ON THE

1506
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
SCENE WHETHER OR NOT PARENTS ARE

1507
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000

1508
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
AND CASUALTIES AND THE FACT THAT

1509
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
TEN CHILDREN HAVE BEEN KILLED?
>> Reporter: I DO NOT, SUZANNE.

THIS IS BRAND-NEW INFORMATION,

1511
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
SO I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO

00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
SAMPLE ANY OPINIONS OR FIND OUT

1513
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
FROM ANYONE IN THE AREA WHETHER

1514
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
THAT INFORMATION IS WIDELY

1515
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
AVAILABLE AS OF YET.

1517
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
US A SENSE OF WHAT IT IS LIKE?

1518
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
WE'RE LOOKING AT LIVE PICTURES,

1519
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
OF COURSE.
WE SEE A LOT OF THE EMERGENCY

1520
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
PERSONNEL AND HAVE SEEN PICTURES

1521
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
WITH CHILDREN AND WORRIED

1522
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
PARENTS.
WE SEE FOCUS ON ONE PARTICULAR

1523
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
VEHICLE THAT HAS BEEN CORDONED

1524
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
OFF.
GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT IT IS

1525
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
LIKE THERE CLOSE TO THE SCHOOL

1526
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
AND CLOSE TO THOSE OFFICIALS WHO

1527
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
WILL SOON SPEAK WITH US ABOUT

1528
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
SOME OF THE DETAILS THEY'VE JUST

1529
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
LEARNED.
>> WELL, YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S

1530
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
JUST -- IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED IN

1531
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH AS

1532
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
CHAOS, AND NOW THERE IS JUST

1533
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
UTTER SADNESS AND SHOCK THAT YOU

1534
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
SEE ON THE FACES OF PEOPLE WHO

1535
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
CLEARLY AND UNDERSTANDABLY ARE

1536
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
SHAKEN BY WHAT HAS HAPPENED

1537
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
HERE, NOT TO MENTION AS YOU

1538
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
INDICATED, SUZANNE, WHAT THESE

1540
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
THIS AND CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE

1541
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
HEARD IT AND HAVE BEEN QUICKLY

1542
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
HURRIED OUT OF THAT SCHOOL AS

1543
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
SOON AS IT WAS SAFE TO DO SO,

1544
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
WHAT THEY WILL BE GOING THROUGH.

1545
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000

UPON THEM AS WELL AS THIS

OUT, OF COURSE, IN THESE FEW

1549
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000

1636
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
DISCUSSION OF THE USUAL

1637
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
WASHINGTON POLICY DEBATES, BUT I

1638
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
DON'T THINK TODAY IS THAT DAY.

1639
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
>> NO.

1640
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
THIS IS A TRAGEDY OF HISTORIC

1641
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
PROPORTION, A NATIONAL TRAGEDY

1642
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
NOW AS WE LEARN THAT THE DEATH

1644
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
OF THE 27, 18 CHILDREN.

1645
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE VERY YOUNG

1646
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
CHILDREN BECAUSE SANDY HOOK

1647
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
ELEMENTARY IS A SCHOOL THAT HAS

1648
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FOURTH

1649
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000

01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
VERY -- SO YOUNG ATTEND AN

1651
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THAT IS NOT

01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
EVEN K THROUGH 8.

1653
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
IT'S K THROUGH 4 AT THIS SCHOOL.

1654
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
SO HORRIFIC, HORRIFIC NEWS THAT

1655
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
WE ARE ALL LEARNING.

1656
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
THE SHOOTER -- THIS IS THE --

1657
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
THERE WERE REPORTS OF TWO,

1658
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
BUT -- ONE OR TWO SUSPECTS.

1659
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
ONE IS DEAD, ONE TAKEN AWAY IN

1660
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
HANDCUFFS.

1661
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
THE ONE WE'RE ASSUMING WITH THE

1662
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
TIES TO NEW JERSEY WHOSE HOME

1663
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
THE FEDS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

1664
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
RAIDING WE ASSUME THAT IS THE

1665
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
DECEASED GUNMAN.

1666
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT.

1667
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
>> WE DON'T KNOW.

1668
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
THAT IS THE OTHER FACILITY WE

1669
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
WERE TELLING YOU ABOUT.

1670
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
THE VOLUNTEER FIREHOUSE.

1671
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE VEHICLES

1672
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
THERE IN THE TOP THERE ABOVE THE

1673
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
BUILDING.

1674
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
YOU CAN SEE A FIRE TRUCK TAKEN

1675
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
OUT OF THE BUILDING.

1676
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR SCREEN IS

1677
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
WHERE ALL THE AMBULANCES

1678
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
GATHERED.

1679
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
WE WANT TO REITERATE THIS WAS

1680
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
SHOT A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO NOW.

1681
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
THIS IS WHERE THE CHILDREN WERE

1682
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
TAKEN FOLLOWING THE SHOOTING.

1683
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
THEY WERE LED BY STAFF MEMBERS

1684
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
PROBABLY THROUGH THE WOODS THERE

1685
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
THAT YOU SEE IN THE BOTTOM OF

1686
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
YOUR SCREEN TO THAT AS A STAGING

1687
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
AREA.

1688
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
THEN EVENTUALLY PARENTS CAME TO

1689
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
LEAD THEIR CHILDREN AWAY.

1690
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
AT SOME POINT IN THIS VIDEO WE

1691
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
DID SEE AN AMBULANCE TAKING AWAY

1692
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
SOMEONE ON A STRETCHER.

1693
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
LOTS OF VEHICLES THERE.

1694
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
THAT'S ALSO WHERE THE MEDIA

1695
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
GATHERED, AND WE'RE TOLD THAT

1696
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
ABOUT A HALF HOUR AGO ALL THE

1697
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
MEDIA WERE ASKED TO LEAVE THAT

1698
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
AREA.
THAT'S THE SCHOOL.

1699
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

1700
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000

01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
WE'RE TOLD THAT ALL OF THE NEWS

1702

IF YOU JUST ARE JOINING US, THAT

1704
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
SCHOOL CONSISTS OF 600 STUDENTS

1705

1706
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000

SHORTLY AFTER THE SCHOOL DAY

1707
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
BEGAN, ONE REPORT SAYS DURING

1708
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000

BEFORE ALL WAS SAID AND DONE, 18

1713
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
CHILDREN AND 9 ADULTS WERE

1714
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
KILLED.
>> I CAN ONLY IMAGINE AT IN THE

1715
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
POINT IF THE REPORTS THAT WE

WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING ON THE

1719
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000

WE ARE A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY

1724
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
FROM WHERE THE SCHOOL IS

1725
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000

1726
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
CRIME SCENE THERE, VERY ACTIVE

1727
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
CRIME SCENE AT THIS TIME.

1728
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000

1731
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
OF THOSE DEAD ARE CHILDREN IN

1732
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000

THE OTHER INFORMATION IS THAT

1734
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
THE SHOOTER WAS DISCOVERED IN A

01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
CLASSROOM.

1736
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE TOOK

1737
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
HIS OWN LIFE OR WAS KILLED BY

1738
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
POLICE OR IN SOME OTHER WAY.

1739
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000

1740
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000

1743
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
THE SHOULDER OF THE CHILD IN

1744
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
FRONT OF THEM AS THEY ARE LED

1745
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000

1746
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
FIREHOUSE.

1747
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
MANY OF THEM MEETING ALREADY

1748
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
WITH THEIR PARENTS WHO WERE

1749
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
NOTIFIED.

1750
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
MANY OF THEM HAD SIGNED UP AND

1751
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
LEARNED ABOUT THIS TRAGEDY BY

01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000

CONTINUE TO LOOK AROUND THIS

1760
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
SCENE.
>> SUSAN, ARE THERE STILL

1761
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
CHILDREN INSIDE OF THE SCHOOL?

1762
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
>> Reporter: WE DON'T BELIEVE

01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
SO, BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY

1764
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000

THIS HAPPENED AT ABOUT 9:40 OR

1765
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
SO EASTERN TIME.

1766
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000

01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
SAFE FOR THEM TO DO SO

1771
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
CHILDREN -- FIRST THE SCHOOL WAS

1772
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
LOCKED DOWN, WHICH IS USUALLY

1773
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
THE CASE.

1774
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
ONCE IT WAS SAVE TO LEAD THE

1775
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
CHILDREN OUT OF THE SCHOOL,

1776
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

1777
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
WE HAVE LOCAL POLICE, STATE

THEY'RE CANVASSING THE AREA TO

1782
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
MAKE SURE THERE WAS ONLY ONE

1783
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
SHOOTER, SUSPECTED SHOOTER

1784
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
INVOLVED IN THIS TERRIBLE

1785
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
MASSACRE AS WELL AS WHETHER

1786
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
THERE WAS ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED.

1787
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
TO THAT END THEY'VE BEEN WALKING

1788
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
DOWN THE STREET LOOKING AT

1789
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
VARIOUS CARS.

1790
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
ONE CAR IS CORN DONED OFF AND

1791
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000

1792
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000

1793
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
SURE THEY HAVE -- THAT THERE'S

1794
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
ONLY ONE SUSPECT INVOLVED IN

1795
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
THIS CASE.
>> ALL RIGHT.

1796
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
SUSAN, WE'RE GOING TO GET TO YOU

1797
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000

01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
HAPPENS, BUT I WANT OUR VIEWERS

1800
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000

1801
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000

1802
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000

SCHOOL WHO WAS THERE, WHO

1807
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
WITNESSED THE SHOOTING.

1808
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000

1832
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000

WHEN I TALKED TO HER, SHE WAS

1863

SHE COULDN'T TELL -- SHE DIDN'T

1865

in a budget.

01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
SITTING IN CLASS THIS MORNING

2172
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
AND SAW A LOT OF MISS.

2173
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
TELL ME HOW YOU FOUND OUT WHAT

2174
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
WAS GOING ON?
>> WELL, WE FOUND THERE WAS ALL

2175
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,000
THESE PEOPLE, AND WE FOUND OUT

2176
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
WE WERE RIGHT NEAR THE WINDOW IN

2177
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
OUR CLASSROOM.

2178
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
WE SAW LIKE POLICE OFFICERS AND

2179
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
WE HEARD THEM ON THE ROOF AND IN

2180
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
OUR BUILDING.

2181
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
>> Reporter: WAS EVERYBODY

2182
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
CRYING, SCARED, WANTING THEIR

2183
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
PARENTS TO COME GET THEM?

2184
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
>> YEAH, THEY WERE.

2185
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
AND THEN SOME PEOPLE WERE EVEN

2186
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
LIKE -- THEY KIND OF GOT A

2187
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
STOMACHACHE.

2188
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
>> Reporter: DID YOU HEAR ANY

2189
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
GUNSHOTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

2190
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
>> POLICE OFFICERS, THEY WERE

2191
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
THERE KIND OF, BECAUSE THERE

2192
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
WERE POLICE OFFICERS RIGHT OUT

2193
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
THE DOOR TRYING TO FIND THE GUY.

2194
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
>> JOINING US BY PHONE IS

2195
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
SECURITY EXPERT RETIRED NASSAU

2196
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
COUNTY, NEW YORK POLICE OFFICER

2197
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
LOU PALUMBO.

2198
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
WE WERE SPEAKING EARLIER TODAY

2199
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
ABOUT HOW THE WHOLE MORNING

2200
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
UNFOLDED AND WORST NIGHTMARES

2201
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
COMING TRUE HERE WHEN YOU LISTEN

2202
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
TO THE SUSPECTED NUMBER OF

2203
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
FATALITIES, AT LEAST 20 KILLED,

2204
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
OF THOSE 10 CHILDREN.

2205
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
HOW DOES THIS EVEN COMPARE, I HE

2206
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
MEAN, TO WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED

2207
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
IN THE PAST?
IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE.

2208
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
>> YOU'RE ASKING ME, SUZANNE,

2209
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
HOW THIS COMPARES TO PRIOR

2210
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
INCIDENTS?
>> YES.

2211
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
>> I THINK IT'S ESCALATED.

2212
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
WHEN YOU LOOK AT A DEATH TOLL

2213
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
WITH CHILDREN TO THIS MAGNITUDE,

2214
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WORSE IT'S

2215
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
GOING TO GET.

2216
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I WILL TELL YOU UNEQUIVOCALLY

2217
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
WITH THIS DEATH TOLL WE'VE

2218
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
SURPASSED PRIOR INCIDENTS, OF

2219
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
WHICH APPROXIMATELY SEVEN IN THE

2220
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

2221
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I CERTAINLY HOPE WE DON'T HAVE A

2222
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
REPEAT OF THIS OR ANYTHING THAT

2223
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
OUTDOES THIS, SO TO SPEAK.

2224
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
>> I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT

2225
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
HAPPENS NEXT.
AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERT, CAN

2226
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
YOU EXPLAIN TO US WHERE DO YOU

2227
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
BEGIN?
WHERE DO YOU START HERE IN TERMS

2228
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
OF THE CHILDREN, THEIR SAFETY,

2229
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
THE PARENTS, IDENTIFYING THE

2230
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
DEAD?
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

2231
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,000
>> WHAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHT NOW

2232
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
IS TO -- NOT TO BE TRITE ABOUT

2233
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
IT, BUT THEY'RE PUTTING THE

2234
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
PIECES OF THIS TOGETHER ON MANY

2235
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
LEVELS, AS YOU JUST ALLUDED TO.

2236
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO

2237
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
IS DEAD.

2238
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

2239
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
NOTIFICATIONS.

2240
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO RUN A CRIME

2241
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
SCENE AND CREATE A PROFILE ON

2242
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
THE INDIVIDUAL WHO PERPETRATED

2243
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
THIS.

2244
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
THEY'RE TRACKING DOWN THESE

2245
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
FIREARMS THAT WERE IN HIS

2246
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
POSSESSION TO DETERMINE HOW HE

2247
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
WAS CAPABLE OF OBTAINING THEM.

2248
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
SUZANNE, YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY

2249
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
THIS TO YOU.

2250
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I THINK WE HAVE TO GAIN SOME

2251
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
SENSIBILITY IN OUR CULTURE.

2252
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
THIS IS THE SEVENTH OR EIGHTH

2253
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
INCIDENT INVOLVING FIREARMS, AND

2254
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I SUPPORT THE SECOND AMENDMENT.

2255
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT

2256
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
THIS IS ABOUT.
IT'S QUITE APPARENT THAT PEOPLE

2257
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN FIREARMS WHEN

2258
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
THEY ARE NOT IN THE RIGHT STATE

2259
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
OF MIND.

2260
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I THINK WE NEED TO HOW WOULD YOU

2261
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
SAY IMPOSE PART OF THE VETTING

2262
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
PROCESS SIMILAR TO ONE WE GO

2263
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,000
THROUGH THIS LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

2264
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
INCLUDE MINNESOTA MULTIPHASE

2265
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
ZWICK HE SCREENING TEST.

2266
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
>> WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU.

2267
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I HEAR YOUR POINT.

2268
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
WE'LL GO DIRECTLY IT TO WABC AND

2269
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
DIP IN ON SOME NEWS THAT THEY'RE

2270
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
LEARNING.

2271
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
>> COME FROM A SCENE AND HUG

2272
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
EACH OTHER SO EARLY ON IN THEIR

2273
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
INVESTIGATION.

2274
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,000
SO CLEARLY A VERY TELLING

2275
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
MOMENT.

2276
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
YOU CAN -- ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE

2277
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
THE CARNAGE INSIDE THAT SCHOOL

2278
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT DOWN

2279
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
THERE.

2280

THANKS FOR THE UPDATE.

IT'S 1:25 IN THE AFTERNOON.

2283
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
WE'RE CONTINUING TO FOLLOW THE

2284
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,000
TRAGIC STORY OUT OF NEWTOWN,

2285
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
CONNECTICUT THAT STARTED AROUND

2286
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
9:30 THIS MORNING.

2287
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
A GUNMAN WALKING INTO SANDY HOOK

2288
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
FROM WHAT WE KNOW NOW, THE

2289
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
LATEST, 27 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

2290
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,000
KILLED, MOSTLY CHILDREN.

2291
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
>> THE GUNMAN BELIEVED TO BE IN

2292
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
HIS 20s.

2293
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
HE HAD AT LEAST TWO GUNS ON HIM.

2294
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
THEY WERE RECOVERED AAT THE

2295
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000

ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES AND A

2297
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
BULLETPROOF VEST.

2298
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
>> MOST OF THE CHILDREN -- THE

2299
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
SCHOOL WAS EVACUATED.

2300
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
THOSE CHILDREN WERE TAKEN TO A

2301
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
NEARBY FIREHOUSE EARLY THIS

2302
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000

MOST OF THE PARENTS BEING ABLE

BUT NOW THIS WAIT, THIS

2305
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
AGONIZING WAIT FOR THOSE PARENTS

2306
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE

2307
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
THEIR CHILDREN.

2308
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
AS MANY AS 18 CHILDREN MAY BE

2309
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000

US THIS MINIVAN A SHORT TIME

2318
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
AGO.

2319
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
IT'S A SECOND CAR IN THE PARKING

2320
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
LOT THAT INVESTIGATORS HAVE

2321
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
CORDONED OFF AND ARE PAYING

PARTICULARLY CLOSE ATTENTION TO.

2323
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
YOU CAN SEE THE OFFICERS THERE.

TOWN IN FAIRFIELD COUNTY,

2328
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
CONNECTICUT.
>> INITIALLY THERE WAS SOME

2329
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS IF THERE

2330
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
WAS MORE THAN ONE PERSON
INVOLVED PRIMARILY BECAUSE

2331
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
PEOPLE WERE RUNNING FROM THE

2332
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
SCHOOL AND THEY HAD TO QUESTION

2333
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
WHETHER SOME OF THE PEOPLE

2334
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
RUNNING WERE INVOLVED AND THE

2335
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
CHAOS OF THE MOMENT.

2336
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,000
THEY ARE PURSUING EVERY LEAD TO

2337
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
CONFIRM WHETHER IT WAS ONE
PERSON OR MORE.

2338
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
AT THIS POINT WE KNOW OF THE ONE

2339
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
PERSON, BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

2340
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
END THEIR INVESTIGATION WITH

2341
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
THAT.
THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUEBEEN S

2342
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
ACTIVITY ALL ALONG SURROUNDING

2343
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
THAT.

2344
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
TO ANSWER MANY QUESTIONS, THEY

2345
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
SET UP A SPACE NEAR THE SCHOOL

2346
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
WHERE THE GOVERNOR AND OTHER LAW

2347
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE

2348
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
EXPECTED TO BRIEF REPORTERS WHEN

2349
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
THEY HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION I

2350
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000

THIS IS THE FINAL POINT WHERE

PARENTS CAN COME TO.

2386
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
THEY HAVE TO WALK UP TO THAT

2387
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
HILL TO GET UP TO THE FIREHOUSE

2388
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000

2389
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE DITCHING

LET'S HEAR A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT

01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
THEY HAD TO SAY.

2408
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
>> I WAS IN THE GYM AT THE TIME.

2409
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
SO THE TEACHERS -- HE WE HEARD

2410
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000

2411
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
THAT IT WAS THE CUSTODIAN

2412
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
KNOCKING STUFF DOWN.

2413
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
WE HEARD SCREAMING.

2414
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,000
AND SO WENT ONTO -- WE WENT TO

2415
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
THE WALL, AND WE SAT DOWN.

2416
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
THEN THE POLICE CAME IN.

2417
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
IT'S LIKE, IS HE IN HERE?

2418
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
THEN HE RAN OUT.

2419
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
THEN SOMEBODY YELLED GET TO A

2420
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
SAFE PLACE, SO WE WENT TO THE

2421
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
CLOSET IN THE GYM AND WE SAT

2422
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
THERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

2423
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
THEN THE POLICE LIKE WERE

2424
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000

THEY'RE POLICE AT EVERY DOOR

2429
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000

QUICK, QUICK, COME ON.

2431
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
WE RAN DOWN TO THE FIREHOUSE.

2432
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
THERE'S A MAN THAT PINNED DOWN

2433
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
TO THE GROUND WITH HANDCUFFS ON,

2434
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE

2435
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
VICTIM.

2436
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000

2442
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
HAPPENED.
HE HEARD THE GUNSHOTS.

2443
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE

2444
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
THINGS WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO

2445
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED.

2446
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
WHEN WE TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED

2447
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
IN DETAIL, IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT

2448
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
MUCH WORSE.

2449
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
>> DID THEY GIVE YOU ANY

2450
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
INFORMATION?
WAS IT AN ADULT?

2451
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
OUTSIDE OF THAT.

2452
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
I HAVEN'T HAD ANY INFORMATION

2453

WE'RE GATHERING AROUND HERE.

2456
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000

2479
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
OVER HERE TO THE ELEMENTARY

NOT SURE AT THAT MOMENT IF THEY

2488
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
REALIZED HOW LUCKY THEY WERE

2489
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000

EARLY ON THEY WERE FILLED WITH

2525
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
RELIEF BECAUSE THEY REALIZED

01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
IS AFFECTING THEM.

2531
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
WE'VE SEEN SOME VERY, VERY

2532
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
GRIEF-STRICKEN AND AFFECTED AND

2533
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
TEAR-STREAKED FACES DOWN THE

2534
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
ROAD HERE.

2535
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I SPOKE WITH MAUREEN CARE HE

2536
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
RINZ WHO WAS A NURSE AT DANBURY

2537
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
HOSPITAL WHO RUSHED TO THE SCENE

2538
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
WHEN SHE HEARD ABOUT THE

2539
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
SHOOTING.

2540
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
HE SHE ARRIVED WHEN THE LIGHTLY

2541
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
INJURED PEOPLE WERE REMOVED AND

2542
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
WANT UPPED TO DO SO IF THEY

2543
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
COULD HELP OTHERS.

2544
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
THERE WERE 20 CHILDREN INSIDE

2545
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
THAT SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO HELP.

2546
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
ALL OF THEM DEAD, AND SHE

2547
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
DESCRIBES BEING PRESENT WHEN THE

2548
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
PARENTS WERE GIVEN THE AWFUL

2549
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
NEWS.

2550
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,000
SHE IS JUST SHATTERED.
LISTEN.

2551
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,000
>> Reporter: I SEE YOU'VE BEEN

2552
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
CRYING.
>> YES.

2553
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
>> Reporter: IS IT BECAUSE OF

2554
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
WHAT YOU SAW?

2555
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
>> NO, THEY WOULDN'T LET US IN

2556
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
THE BUILDING.

2557
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
ONE OF THE COPS, YOU KNOW, THE

2558
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
WORSE THING HE'D SEEN IN HIS

2559
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
ENTIRE CAREER, BUT IT WAS WHEN

2560
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
THEY TOLD ALL THESE PARENTS

2561
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
WAITING FOR CHILDREN TO COME

2562
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
OUT.
THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE, YOU

2563
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
KNOW, STILL ALIVE.

2564
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
THERE'S 20 PARENTS THAT WERE

2565
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
JUST TOLD THAT THEIR CHILDREN

2566
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
ARE DEAD.

2567
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
IT WAS AWFUL.

2568
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
>> YOU WERE UNABLE TO DO

2569
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
ANYTHING?

2570
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
>> RIGHT.

2571
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
WE KNEW AT ONE POINT THEY ASKED

2572
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
THE AMBULANCES TO LEAVE, THAT

2573
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
THEY DIDN'T NEED THEM, AND WE

2574
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
KNEW THAT THAT WASN'T A GOOD

2575
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
SIGN.

2576
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
>> Reporter: SHE WAS CRYING.

2577
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,000
HER TEENAGE SON WAS ALSO CRYING,

2578
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
JUST HAVING WITNESSED THAT

2579
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
OUTPOURING OF GRIEF AND

2580
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
DISBELIEF, THE PARENTS HEARING

2581
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
THEIR WORST NIGHTMARES COME

2582
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
TRUE, THAT THEIR CHILDREN HAD

2583
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
BEEN KILLED.

2584
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000

A SHORT TIME AGO I'M TOLD THAT

01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,000

01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,000
THE SCHOOL HIDE INNINGING IN A .

2590
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
THEY STAYED HIDDEN AND DID NOT

2591
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
MOVE AND POLICE FOUND THEM IN

2592
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
THE LAST HOUR OR SO.

2593
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
THAT IS A SITUATION HERE THAT

2594
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
HOW DESPERATE THE SITUATION WAS.

01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
PEOPLE HID.

01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
PEOPLE TRIED TO SAVE THEMSELVES.

2597
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
PEOPLE WERE SAVED.

2598
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
PEOPLE WITNESSED TERRIBLE

2599
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
TRAGEDY AND TERRIBLE LOSS.

2600
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
THIS IS GOING TO BE WITH THIS

2601
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
COMMUNITY FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

2602
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
WE'RE LIVE NIN NEWTOWN,

01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
INTO CUSTODY IN THE WOODS JUST

2606
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000

2607
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
SHORTLY AFTER THE INCIDENT?

2608
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000

2609
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000

SCHOOL.

2613
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
YOUR PARENTS SIGN UP FOR IT.

2614
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I JUST GOT A MESSAGE SAYING FROM

2615
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
THE SUPERINTENDENT THAT THERE

2616
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000

2619
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
>> I WAS LIKE, OH, MY GOSH.

2620
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
THEN I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS

2621
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
HER SCHOOL.

2622
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I'M LIKE -- IT JUST SEEMED SO

2623
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
UNREAL.

2624
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
MY HEART IS IN A MILLION PIECES

2625
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
RIGHT NOW FOR PARENTS AND THE

2626
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000

BECAUSE IT'S -- WHO WOULD EVER

2628
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
THINK IN A SMALL TOWN AND

2629
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
PEOPLE -- YOU KNOW, I MEAN, THE

2630
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000

>> WE'RE GOING TO AFFILIATE WCBS

2632
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000

01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
THEY'RE LEARNING ON THE GROUND

2634
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
AS WELL.

2635
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
LET'S LISTEN IN.
>> THAT IS WHAT THAT WOMAN WAS

2636
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
GOING THROUGH.
SHE SHOWED UP READY TO DO HER

2637
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
JOB, BUT THERE WAS NOTHING SHE

2638
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
COULD DO.

2639
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE ABLE TO BE

2640
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
HELPED REMOVED FROM THE SCENE.

2641
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
SHE WATCHED IN HORROR AND IS

2642
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
GOING HOME TO TRY AND PROCESS

2643
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
THAT.
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, LOU.

2644
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

2645
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
THAT IS THE WORST THING THAT CAN

2646
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
HAPPEN WHEN YOU SET UP THE

2647
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
TRIAGE TO DO THE FIRST AID, AND

2648
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
IT'S SIMPLY HE BEYOND THAT.

2649
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
WE HAVE SEEN IT.

2650
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
>> LOU, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE

2651
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
IS GRIEF COUNSELORS -- THERE ARE

2652
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
GRIEF COUNSELORS AT THAT

2653
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
FIREHOUSE NOW TO DEAL WITH THIS

2654
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
UNIMAGINABLE TRAGEDY.

2655
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
>> Reporter: YEAH.

2656
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
I MEAN, I'LL ALWAYS HEAR THAT

2657
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
GRIEF COUNSELORS.

2658
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,000
I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU CAN SAY TO

2659
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
A PARENT IN A SITUATION LIKE

2660
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
THAT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

2661
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I HOPE I NEVER HAVE TO FIND OUT

2662
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
FIRSTHAND, BUT THERE ARE

2663
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE STANDING

2664
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
BY TRYING TO WALK THESE PEOPLE

2665
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
THROUGH THE INITIAL PROCESSES OF

2666
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
THIS CRUSHING GRIEF THAT THEY

2667
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
MUST BE FEELING, AND ESPECIALLY

2668
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, ESPECIALLY

2669
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
CHILDREN, ESPECIALLY THE

2670
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,000
LOCATION, THE INCON GRUTS OF IT

2671
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
ALL IS STAGGERING.

2672
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
>> LOU YOUNG, THANKS SO MUCH.

2673
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,000

TIES TO THE SCHOOL WHO WOULD

2676
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
PERPETRATE SUCH AN ACT.

2677
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
>> THE NUMBERS CBS NEWS HAS

2678
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
CONFIRMED, AT LEAST 26 ARE DEAD,

2679
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
AT LEAST 18 OF THEM ARE

2680
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
CHILDREN.

2681
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
WE'RE HEARING OF THOSE PARENTS

2682
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
WHO WENT TO REUNITE WITH THEIR

2683
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
CHILDREN AT THE FIREHOUSE AND

2684
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,000

CHILDREN KILLED, MOTHERS,

2688
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:16,000
FATHERS THERE.
WE SAW SO MANY REUNITE, EMBRACE

2689
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
AS THEIR CHILDREN RAN TO THEM AS

2690
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
WE LOOK AT VIDEO FROM EARLIER AS

2691
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
PARENTS WERE TAKING THEIR

2692
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
CHILDREN AWAY FROM THE

2693
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
FIREHOUSE.

2694
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
THEY HAD BEEN EVACUATED FROM THE

2695
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000

2696
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000

WERE FIRED JUST AFTER 9:30 THIS

2698
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
MORNING.
WE'RE LOOKING AT PICTURES OF

2699
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN AS

2700
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
THEY ARE HEADED HOME.

2701
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
MAYBE SOME OF THEM NOT KNOWING

2702
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
THE SEVERITY OF THE SITUATION.

2703
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
OTHERS KNOWING THIS.

2704
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
THIS WAS A LITTLE EARLIER ON THE

2705
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
SCENE JUST OUTSIDE THE

2706
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
FIREHOUSE.

2707
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
SO THE LATEST INFORMATION WE

2708
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
HAVE IN REGARD TO THOSE INVOLVED

2709
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
WITH THIS SHOOTING.

SURROUNDS THE SCHOOL, AND

2892
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
PARENTS ARE WALKING IN AND OUT

2893
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
OF THIS FIREHOUSE USED AS A

2894
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
MAKESHIFT SHELTER IN WHICH

2895
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,000
THEY'RE TENDING THOSE INJURED

2896
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
AND USHERING THOSE AWAY BY WAY

2897
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
OF AMBULANCES.

2898
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
THERE'S ABOUT FOUR AMBULANCES ON

2899
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
THE SCENE HERE.

2900
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
I'VE SPOKEN TO A NUMBER OF THE

2901
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
PARENTS, AND APPARENTLY WHAT

2902
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
TRANSPIRED WAS THAT EARLIER THIS

2903
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,000
MORNING MANY OF THEM RECEIVED AN

2904
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
AUTOMATED SCHOOL FROM THE SCHOOL

2905
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
SUPERINTENDENT INDICATING THERE

2906
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
WAS A SHOOTING.

2907
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
IT WASN'T CLEAR WHICH SCHOOL AT

2908
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
THAT POINT SHOOTING OCCURRED, SO

2909
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:28,000
MANY OF THEM PANIC STRICKEN RAN

2910
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
TO THEIR NEAREST SCHOOLS WHERE

2911
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
SOME OF THE LOVED ONES ARE HELD.

2912
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:37,000
SEVERAL HAVE SINCE NOW AUEMERGE.

2913
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:41,000
SOME ARE ALMOST INCONSOLABLE HOW

2914
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,000
UPSET THEY WERE.

2915
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
ONE WOMAN CAME WALKING UP THE

2916
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
STREET SCREAMING WHY, WHY?

2917
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
NOT INDICATING WHAT HAPPENED.

2918
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
OTHERS WERE CLUTCHING THEIR

2919
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
CHILDREN AND TAKING THEM AWAY

2920
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
FROM THE SCHOOL AS FAST AS THEY

2921
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:54,000
COULD.
THAT'S THE SCENE HERE.

2922
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
ONE OF HEAVY SECURITY.

2923
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
WE'VE GOT ATF, FBI, SEVERAL LAW

2924
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:03,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT ARE

2925
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
BASICALLY CLAD IN TACTICAL GEAR

2926
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:09,000
WITH WEAPONS DRAWN AND WIELDING

2927
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
ASSAULT RIFLES AND ALL THE WHILE

2928
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
YOU HAVE PARENTS STREAMING IN

2929
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
AND OUT OF THIS AREA CLUTCHING

2930
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
THEIR CHILDREN AND BASICALLY

2931
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,000
JUST TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THE

2932
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
SCENE.
IT'S A MEDIA CIRCUS IN WHICH

2933
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
MANY OF THE REPORTERS HERE

2934
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT

2935
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
HAS HAPPENED.

2936
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
BUT MOST PARENTS ARE JUST

2937
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,000
ESSENTIALLY LOOKING TO GET AS

2938
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,000
FAR AWAY FROM THE SCENE AS

2939
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,000
POSSIBLE.

2940
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,000
>> DPAIF

2941
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
WE HEARD THAT THE GOVERNOR IS

2942
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
MEETING WITH THE FAMILIES, THE

2943
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
PARENTS OF THOSE WHOSE CHILDREN

2944
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
HAVE BEEN KILLED.

2945
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
HAVE YOU GOTTEN A SENSE OF WHERE

2946
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:46,000
THE GOVERNOR, WHERE THOSE PAR  T

2947
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
PARENTS ARE ON THE SCENE WHERE

2948
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
YOU ARE AND WHETHER OR NOT

2949
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
YOU'VE SEEN SOME PARENTS WHO

2950
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,000
HAVE RECEIVED THE DEVASTATING

2951
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
NEWS?
>> Reporter: WE HAVE.

2952
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
MOST OF THE PARENTS THAT ARE

2953
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:59,000
STRICKEN WITH SOME OF THAT

2954
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
DEVASTATING NEWS, THAT MORE

2955
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
FATAL NEWS ARE HOLED UP IN THAT

2956
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,000
FIREHOUSE.
THERE ARE AT LEAST SEVERAL DOZEN

2957
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
PEOPLE INSIDE, SEVERAL PARENTS.

2958
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
ON OCCASION YOU'LL SEE PEOPLE

2959
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,000
COMING OUT AND SORT OF ALMOST

2960
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
INCONSOLABLE AS I MENTIONED

2961
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
BEFORE.
IT SEEMS THAT THAT FIREHOUSE

2962
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
CONTINUES TO BE SORT OF THE

2963
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
SAFEHOUSE AS AUTHORITIES IN THE

2964
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
REGION REALLY START TO TRY TO

2965
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
PIN DOWN THIS AREA.

2966
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
WELL, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AS

2967
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
ACTIVE A SCENE AS IT DID

2968
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
EARLIER.
THEY'RE STILL GOING HOUSE TO

2969
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
HOUSE, STILL CHECKING BUILDINGS.

2970
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR THIS IS AN

2971
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,000
ENTIRELY SECURE SCENE.

2972
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
THAT SAID YOU HAVE PARENTS LIKE

2973
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
I MENTIONED BEFORE REALLY TRYING

2974
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
TO GET AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE.

2975
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,000
>> DAVID, WHAT ARE THOSE PARENTS

2976
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
SAYING.

2977
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
THEY WERE ALERTED THERE WAS A

2978
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
SHOOTING THAT TOOK PLACE.

2979
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
ARE THESE PARENTS SATISFIED THAT

2980
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,000
THEY GOT INFORMATION IN A TIMELY

2981
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
WAY?

2982
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
ARE THEY DESPONDENT OR CONFUSED?

2983
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
>> I THINK YOU HIT IT ON THE

2984
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
HEAD THERE.

2985
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
DESPONDENT WOULD BE THE

2986
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
OPERATIVE WORD RIGHT NOW.

2987
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
IT'S CLEARLY ONE OF A PARENT'S

2988
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
MOST FEARED PROSPECTS HERE, OF

2989
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
GETTING NEWS OF THIS SORT,

2990
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
PARTICULARLY WHILE THEY'RE AT

2991
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
WORK, THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE IN

2992
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
HARM'S WAY.

2993
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,000
MOST OF THE PARENTS, THE FEW

2994
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
THAT WE ACTUALLY GOT A CHANCE TO

2995
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
SPEAK TO, WERE JUST RELIEVED

2996
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
THAT THEIR CHILDREN WERE ALL

2997
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
RIGHT.

2998
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,000
THE RESOUNDING FEELING THAT ONE

2999
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
REALLY GETS FROM BEING DOWN HERE

3000
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
IS SORT OF A SENSE OF NOT

3001
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
KNOWING WHAT TRANSPIRED AND WHAT

3002
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
MAY CONTINUE TO BE TRANSPIRING.

3003
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR THIS IS AN

3004
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
ENTIRELY SECURE SCENE.

3005
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,000
AT THE SAME TIME IT'S ONE OF
THOSE THINGS THAT IT REALLY,

3006
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
REALLY CAN'T BE PUT INTO WORDS

3007
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
HOW TERRIBLE THIS MUST BE FOR

3008
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
SOME FAMILY MEMBERS.

3009
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:48,000
SO AS THEIR SORT OF WIPING TEARS

3010
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,000
AWAY FROM THEIR EYES TALKING

3011
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,000
INTO CELL PHONES WITH FAMILY

3012
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
MEMBERS AND FRIENDS RECANTING A

3013
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
SEEN THEY WITNESSED INSIDE THE

3014
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
FIREHOUSE AND TALKING WITH

3015
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
CHILDREN WHO HAD TO BE HUDDLED

3016
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
INTO CLASSROOMS AS ACCOMPLICE

3017
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
AND TEACHERS HUDDLED THEM

3018
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
TOWARDS THE BACK OF THE ROOM AS

3019
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
THIS SHOOTING TOOK PLACE.

3020
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
IT'S JUST -- IT'S A SCENE OF

3021
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
SHOCK, DISMAY AND IT'S NOT CLEAR

3022
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT.

3023
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
>> DAVID, IT'S KIND OF HARD

3024
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,000
SOMETIMES TO GAUGE, YOU KNOW,

3025
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
WHAT KIDS ARE GOING THROUGH AND

3026
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,000
WHAT THEY'RE FEELING AT THE

3027
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
TIME.

3028
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
WE'VE SEEN SOME CHILDREN WHO

3029
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
HAVE DESCRIBED WHAT THEY SAW.

3030
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
WHAT DO YOU GET FROM SOME OF THE

3031
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
CHILDREN WHO HAVE LEFT WITH

3032
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
THEIR PARENTS?

3033
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
>> Reporter: I TALKED TO ONE
PARENT WITH A CHILD.

3034
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,000
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THOSE

3035
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
PARENTS DON'T WANT TO HAVE THEIR

3036
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
CHILDREN SPEAKING PARTICULARLY

3037
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,000
AFTER AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS, BUT

3038
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
IN MANY OF THE -- IT SEEMS AT

3039
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
LEAST FROM WHAT THIS CHILD WAS

3040
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
SAYING THAT MANY OF THE CHILDREN

3041
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
HERE DON'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD

3042
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
SENSE OF WHAT TRANSPIRED TODAY.

3043
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,000
IT WAS SCARY.

3044
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
IT WAS FRIGHTENING FOR MANY OF

3045
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
THEM.
AND THIS LITTLE GIRL I SPOKE TO

3046
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
WAS SAYING THAT MANY, MANY

3047
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
PEOPLE IN HER CLASSROOM WERE

3048
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
CRYING AS THEY WERE HUDDLED INTO

3049
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
THE BACK ROOM OF THIS SCHOOL

3050
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,000
BUILDING.
SHE WAS IN A THIRD GRADE CLASS,

3051
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
ACTUALLY, AS POLICE BARGED IN.

3052
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,000
AND TEACHERS JUST TRIED TO IN A

3053
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
SENSE GET A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT

3054
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,000
WAS HAPPENING AND TRIED TO

3055
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,000
PROTECT THEM.

3056
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
WHAT IS CONFUSING FOR THEM, AND

3057
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
PROBABLY UNDERSTANDABLY SO.

3058
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
WHAT REALLY HAPPENS NEXT FOR

3059
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
THEM, I'M SURE THE PARENTS ARE

3060
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
GOING TO GO HOME AND TRY TO

3061
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
EXPLAIN AS BEST THEY CAN.

3062
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
YOU TALK TO PARENTS HERE AND

3063
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
THEY REALLY SAY THEIR HEART GOES

3064
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,000
OUT TO THOSE WHO MAY STILL BE

3065
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
HOLED UP IN THE FIREHOUSE TRYING

3066
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,000
TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT HAS

3067
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
HAPPENED.

3068
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
>> DAVID, THERE HAVE BEEN SO

3069
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
MANY DIFFERENT REPORTS ABOUT HOW

3070
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJURED OR

3071
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
KILLED.
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT WOULD BE

3072
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
VERY, VERY US FROM TRALTI IFRUS

3073
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
PEOPLE ON THE GROUND WHO JUST

3074
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MAGNITUDE,

3075
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,000
THEY DON'T KNOW JUST HOW

3076
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,000
SIGNIFICANT THIS IS.

3077
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
IS THERE A SENSE THAT PEOPLE

3078
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,000
JUST WANT MORE INFORMATION?

3079
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
>> I THINK THAT'S THE DRIVING

3080
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,000
THING HERE.
EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR MORE

3081
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
INFORMATION.

3082
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
YOU HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT

3083
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
GROUPS WORKING TOGETHER, YOU

3084
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
HAVE FBI THAT IS HERE, THE ATF,

3085
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
STATE AND LOCAL POLICE.

3086
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
AND YOU KNOW THERE IS A SENSE OF

3087
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON THE

3088
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
SITUATION.
AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS NOT

3089
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
CLEAR WHO THIS PERSON WAS, IF

3090
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
THERE WAS JUST ONE PERSON,

3091
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
WHETHER THAT THERE IS STILL A

3092
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
DANGER OUT THERE.
I UNDERSTAND THERE IS --

3093
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
AUTHORITIES WILL BE HOLDING A

3094
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
PRESS CONFERENCE IN SHORT ORDER

3095
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
TO MAYBE ANSWER SOME OF THOSE

3096
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
QUESTIONS.

3097
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, A SCENE LIKE THIS

3098
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
IS REALLY PROBABLY LEAVES MORE

3099
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS THAN WE

3100
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
COULD EVER GET.

3101
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
HOW A SHOOTING COULD OCCUR

3102
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
INSIDE AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IS

3103
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
JUST -- YOU KNOW, IT IS JUST ONE

3104
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
OF THOSE THINGS THAT -- YOU

3105
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
COVER THESE STORIES, IT'S -- YOU

3106
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
ARE ALWAYS LEFT WITH THOSE

3107
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
QUESTIONS OF WHY THIS TOOK

3108
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
PLACE.
AND THERE IS REALLY NO SENSE OF

3109
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
ANSWERS THAT COULD REALLY EVER

3110
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
SATISFY THAT QUESTION IT SEEMS.

3111
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
BUT MANY PEOPLE HERE ON THE

3112
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
GROUND, PARTICULARLY

3113
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
AUTHORITIES, ARE TRYING TO

3114
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
SECURE THE AREA, MAKE SURE THAT

3115
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,000
THERE IS NOT ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL

3116
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
AROUND, AND ESSENTIALLY WORK TO

3117
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
CONSOLE THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO

3118
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,000
MAY HAVE LOST PEOPLE TODAY.

3119
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
>> I KNOW IT'S HARD AND YOU

3120
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
NEVER REALLY GET OVER THE KIND

3121
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,000
OF SHOCK AND THE KIND OF EMOTION

3122
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE IN THIS

3123
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
KIND OF EPISODE.

3124
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
I COVERED COLUMBINE AND YOU

3125
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
REALLY DON'T THINK THESE KINDS

3126
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
OF THINGS WILL TAKE PLACE, AND

3127
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
THEN THEY TAKE PLACE TIME AND

3128
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
TIME AGAIN.

3129
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
DAVID, REALLY QUICKLY IF YOU

3130
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
CAN, PAINT A PICTURE IF YOU WILL

3131
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,000
OF THE COMMUNITY, WHO ARE THEY,

3132
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
WHAT ARE THEY LIKE.

3133
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,000
>> WELL, THIS TOWN IS, I'D SAY,

3134
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
PROBABLY AN HOUR'S DRIVE NORTH

3135
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
OF NEW YORK CITY AND SORT OF A

3136
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
SLEEPY NEW ENGLAND TOWN.

3137
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,000
AND YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW, IT'S

3138
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
REALLY PRETTY SUBURBAN TOWN IN

3139
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
WHICH, YOU KNOW, TONIGHT'S

3140
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
WOODED AREAS SURROUNDING THIS

3141
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
SCHOOL, AND THE THING YOU HEAR

3142
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
FROM PARENTS AND FROM COMMUNITY

3143
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
MEMBERS IS THAT HOW COULD THIS

3144
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,000
HAPPEN HERE?

3145
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN IN THIS

3146
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
SLEEPY LITTLE TOWN WHERE, YOU

3147
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
KNOW, IT'S FILLED WITH JUST SORT

3148
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,000
OF THESE PICTURESQUE SCENES OF

3149
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
WHAT YOU WOULD IMAGINE OF A NEW

3150
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
ENGLAND TOWN, ANTIQUE SHOPS

3151
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:11,000
ALONG ROADWAYS AND IRONICALLY A

3152
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
CEMETERY, AN OLD CEMETERY DATING

3153
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
BACK TO THE 1800s SITS ON A

3154
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
ROADWAY OVERLOOKING --

3155
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,000
OVERLOOKING THE SCHOOL ITSELF.

3156
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,000
SO THE QUESTION OF WHY AND WHY

3157
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
HERE IS OMNIPRESENT.

3158
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
>> DAVID, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

3159
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR REPORTING

3160
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
AND OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE BEEN

3161
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
TALKING TO A LOT OF FAMILIES AND

3162
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
IT IS JUST DEVASTATING FOR THAT

3163
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
COMMUNITY AND FOR ALL OF US TO

3164
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:39,000
SEE WHAT HAS TRAN SPISPIRED TOD.

3165
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
MEREDITH ARTILY SPOKE WITH US

3166
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
EARLIER AND SHE ACTUALLY TALKED

3167
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
WITH A WITNESS WHO WAS INSIDE OF

3168
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:48,000
THE SCHOOL.

3169
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
>> SHE WAS IN A MEETING THIS

3170
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,000
MORNING, SHE SAID AROUND 9:30,

3171
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
9:35.

3172
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
AND SHE -- THERE WERE ABOUT

3173
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
SEVEN PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, AND IT

3174
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
WAS A MEETING REGARDING ONE OF

3175
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
HER KIDS, SHE HAS CHILDREN AT

3176
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
THE SCHOOL.
AND SHE VOLUNTEERS AT THE SCHOOL

3177
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
AS WELL.

3178
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
AND SHE HEARD -- SHE DESCRIBED

3179
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
IT AS A POP, POP, POP IN THE

3180
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
HALL AND THEY ALL HEARD IT.

3181
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
SEVEN PEOPLE IN MEETING ROOM.

3182
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,000
THEY HEARD THAT SOUND IN THE

3183
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,000
HALL.
AND THEY -- SHE SAID THREE

3184
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
PEOPLE WENT OUT INTO THE HALL,

3185
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
THE PRINCIPAL, THE VICE

3186
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
PRINCIPAL AND THE SCHOOL

3187
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
PSYCHOLOGIST.

3188
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
AND TO HEAR HER DESCRIBE IT, SHE

3189
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
SAID THREE PEOPLE WENT OUT INTO

3190
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
THE HALL AND ONLY ONE -- ONLY

3191
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
ONE PERSON CAME BACK, WHICH WAS

3192
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,000
THE VICE PRINCIPAL, SHE SAID,

3193
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,000
WHO WAS SHOT IN THE LEG OR THE

3194
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
FOOT WHO CAME CRAWLING BACK.

3195
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
AND SHE SAID THAT SHE COWHERED

3196
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
UNDER THE TABLE DURING THAT

3197
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
MOMENT AND CALLED 911 AS DID THE

3198
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ROOM.

3199
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,000
SHE SAID SHE NEVER SAW THE

3200
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,000
SHOOTER, THAT SHE WAS, YOU KNOW,

3201
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
SHE WAS UNDER THE TABLE, THAT

3202
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
THE SHOOTING HAPPENED IN THE

3203
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
HALLWAY, AND TO HEAR HER

3204
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,000
DESCRIBE IT, SHE SAID THERE

3205
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
WAS -- THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A

3206
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
HUNDRED ROUNDS.

3207
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
AND I ASKED HER TO CLARIFY THAT,

3208
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
I SAID REALLY TRULY, A HUNDRED

3209
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,000
ROUNDS AND SHE SAID AT LEAST.

3210
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,000
>> WHEN THE VICE PRINCIPAL CAME

3211
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
CRAWLING BACK, WHAT HAPPENED AT

3212
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,000
THAT POINT?

3213
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

3214
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
HOW DID THE VICE PRINCIPAL

3215
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
MANAGE TO MOVE OR ESCAPE, CAN

3216
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
YOU -- DID SHE DESCRIBE WHAT WAS

3217
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
THE SITUATION AS HE WAS CRAWLING

3218
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,000
BACK?
>> SHE DESCRIBED -- SHE SAID

3219
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
THAT -- SHE SAID THERE WAS

3220
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,000
CONFUSION, THERE WAS YELLING AND

3221
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
UNDERSTANDABLY, SHE SAID THERE
WAS YELLING IN THE HALLWAY, AND

3222
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
SHE COULDN'T TELL FOR A WHILE IF

3223
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
IT WAS THE POLICE OR THE

3224
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,000
SHOOTER.

3225
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,000
WHEN I TALKED TO HER, SHE WAS

3226
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
STILL INSIDE THE SCHOOL, THE

3227
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
SCHOOL IS ON LOCKDOWN.

3228
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
SO SHE COULDN'T TELL -- SHE

3229
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
DIDN'T KNOW IF THE SHOOTER WAS

3230
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,000
DEAD YET OR STILL THERE.

3231
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,000
>> WHAT DID THE VICE PRINCIPAL

3232
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
LOOK LIKE WHEN SHE SAW HIM

3233
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:05,000
RETURN?
>> I DIDN'T HEAR HER DESCRIBE

3234
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
THAT.
SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, SHE SAID,

3235
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
LISTEN, THIS IS A NICE TOWN,

3236
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
THIS IS A NICE SCHOOL, THESE ARE

3237
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
THE KIND OF THINGS THAT DON'T

3238
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
HAPPEN THERE, SHE NOTED THIS WAS

3239
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
NOT SOME HIGH POWERED MEETING,

3240
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
IT WAS, YOU KNOW, ABOUT MY --

3241
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,000
ABOUT ONE OF MY CHILDREN WHO WAS

3242
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,000
IN SECOND GRADE THERE.

3243
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:27,000
AND SHE, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS

3244
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
TEARFUL.

3245
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
JUST UNDERSTANDABLY PANICKED.

3246
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
AND SHE SAID THEY MARCHED AT

3247
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,000
SOME POINT, I DON'T HAVE THE

3248
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
LENGTH OF TIME, BUT SHE SAID

3249
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,000
SOME POINT AFTER THE SHOOTING

3250
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000

3304
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000

THE AUTHORITIES ON THE SCENE,

3311
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, WE'RE

3312
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
HEARING FROM OTHER

3313
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000

3316
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
UNFOLDS.

3317
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THEY WANT

3318
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
TO KEEP PRIVATE AT THE MOMENT.

3319
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000

NUMBERS THERE, STILL IN THE

01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
PROCESS OF NOTIFYING SOME OF THE

3324
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
FAMILIES.
YOUR AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING

3325
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
THEY'RE NOT PUTTING OUT THOSE

3326
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
EXACT NUMBERS UNTIL THEY GET A

3327
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,000
REAL HANDLE ON BEING ABLE TO

3328
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,000
REACH SOME OF THOSE PARENTS AND

3329
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
LET THEM KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.

3330
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,000
>> Reporter: THAT'S EXACTLY

3331
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
RIGHT.
THEY ALSO WANT TO GO THROUGH

3332
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
EVERY LAST NOOK AND CRANNY OF

3333
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,000

3334
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
SURE THAT THERE IS NO OTHER

3335
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,000
FATALITIES INSIDE AND ALSO NO

3336
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
OTHER PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE HIDING

3337
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,000
INSIDE.
AND THEY SAY THE GOVERNOR OF

CONNECTICUT AND STATE POLICE ON

3339
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
THE SCENE HAVE URGED EVERYONE

3340
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
NOT TO GIVE A FIRM FATALITY

3341
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,000
NUMBER JUST YET UNTIL THEY MAKE

3342
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,000
SURE THAT ALL OF THE FAMILIES

3343
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:56,000
HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY NOTIFIED.

3344
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
AND ALL OF THE FAMILIES HAVE

3345
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,000
