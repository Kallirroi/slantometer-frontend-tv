THE RICHEST COUNTIES IN NEW

IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
READER'S DIGEST.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
A COMMUNITY AS IMMUNITY WOULD

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
SEEM TO VIOLENCE AS ANY

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000

FORMER HOMICIDE DETECTIVE, ROD,

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
INVESTIGATION LIKE THIS, TRYING

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS THE

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
MOTIVE BEHIND THIS SUSPECT'S

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
ACTIONS.
WHY THE CHILDREN?
THAT IS THE QUESTION.

144
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
THE OTHER QUESTION AS

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
INVESTIGATORS, WHERE DID HE GET

146
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THE WEAPONS IN WE WILL FIND THAT

148
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
WHERE DID HE GET THE AMMUNITION?

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
WHY DID HE TARGET THIS SCHOOL?

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
THIS IS A VERY FLUID

151
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
INVESTIGATION AND THERE ARE

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
SEVERAL AGENCIES RIGHT NEW.

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH THE

154
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
TELLS ME THAT THE FORENSIC

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
LABORATORY HAS BEEN CALLED IN.

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
THERE ARE SEVERAL AGENCIES

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
INVESTIGATING THIS CASE RIGHT

159
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
NOW AND WE ARE TRYING TO FIND

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
OUT WHY THIS SCHOOL, WHY THIS

161
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
SUSPECT, AND WHAT THE

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
CORRELATION IS BETWEEN THIS GUY

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
AND THE SCHOOL.

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
WE KNOW HIS MOTHER WORKED AT THE

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
SCHOOL BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER

166
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
PEOPLE.

167
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
ALSO, WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE

168
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
MORE VICTIMS.

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
THAT HAS NOT BEEN SAID WHETHER

170
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
THEY MAY OR MAY NOT FIND OTHER

171
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
VICTIMS.
SO THEY ARE INTERVIEWING FAMILY

172
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
MEMBERS OF THE SUSPECT AND THEY

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
ARE ALSO BEGINNING OUT WITH

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
SEARCH WARRANTS RIGHT NOW AS I

175
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
SPEAK INTO AREAS WHICH WE KNOW

176
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
THIS GUY HAS BEEN JUST TO MAKE

177
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
SURE THERE ARE NO OTHER VICTIMS.

178
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
>>Neil: WHEN THEY GO AND TREAT

179
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THE SCHOOL AS A CRIME SCENE,

180
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR?

181
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
>>Guest: WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
FOR SPECIFICALLY, AN EXCELLENT

183
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
QUESTION, WHAT TYPE OF QUESTION

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
DOES THIS GUY USE?

185
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
WHAT TIME OF AMMUNITION DID HE

186
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
USE?
DID HE TARGET ANY OF THE

187
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
CHILDREN OR THE ADULTS

188
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
SPECIFICALLY?
A LOST TIMES IN THESE SITUATIONS

189
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
AN INDIVIDUAL WILL START OUT

190
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
WITH ONE TARGET AND HE WILL WINE

191
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
UP IF HE HAS THE APPEAR IN

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
ADDITION SHOOTING SEVERAL PEOPLE

193
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
WE TRYING TO FIND OUT IF HE

SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING IGNITED

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
THIS GUY.

196
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
EITHER TODAY OR YESTERDAY.

197
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
IT SEEMS LIKE SOMEONE IGNITED

198
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
THIS GUY YESTERDAY BECAUSE IT

199
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
SEEMED LIKE IT WAS A MAPPED

200
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
SHOOTING BUT WHEN I TALK TO MY

201
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
SOURCES HE WAS READY.

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I AM NOT SURE IF HE HAD THIS

203
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
PLANNED OUT OR WAS THIS A

204
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
RESPOND ATTENDOUS EVENT?

205
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE ARE

206
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
TRYING TO FIND OUT RIGHT NOW.

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
>> YOU KNOW, HIS BROTHER, RYAN,

208
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
WHO WAS ORIGINALLY IDENTIFIED AS

209
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
THE SHOOTER MAYBE BECAUSE ADAM

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
HAD SOMETHING INDICATING HE WAS

211
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
RYAN ON HIM, BUT, THAT BROTHER

212
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
IS NOW IN POLICE CUSTODY IN NEW

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
JERSEY.

214
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
WHAT ARE AUTHORITIES TRYING TO

215
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
GET OUT OF HIM IF HE WERE NOT AN

216
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
ACCOMPLICE, WHAT ARE THEY TRYING

217
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
TO LEARN?

218
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
>> IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR FAMILY

219
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
MEMBERS TO BE THOUGHT AS BEING A

220
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
PERSON THAT COMMITTED AN ACT

221
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
WHEN ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER DID

222
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
IT.
THAT HAPPENS OFTEN.

223
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
THE ROPE THE POLICE ARE TALKING

224
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
TO HIS BROTHER IS BECAUSE THOSE

225
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
PEOPLE THAT ARE CLOSE TO THE

226
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
SHOOTER, THE CLOSEST TO THE

MEMBERS, HIS BROTHER, COUSINS,

230
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT THEY

231
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
WILL GET INFORMATION FROM AND

232
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000

00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
INFORMATION AS THEY CAN AS FAST

234
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
AS THEY CAN.

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
KEEP IN MIND, WE STILL DON'T

236
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHER VICTIMS

237
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SHOOTER, WE

240
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
WON'T HAVE THOSE ANSWERS.

241
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
OVER THE NEXT HOPEFULLY 12 TO 24

242
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
HOURS WE WILL HAVE MORE ANSWERS

243
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
COMING FORWARD.

244
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
>>Neil: IS THAT WHY YOU DON'T

245
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
REMOVE BODIES FROM A CRIME

246
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
SCENE?

247
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
>>Guest: YOU ARE RIGHT.

248
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
WE DON'T.

249
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
NOW ADAYS, I HAVE BEEN IF LAW

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
ENFORCEMENT A LONG-TERM WE USED

251
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
TO REMOVE BODIES QUICKER.

252
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
THERE IS NO NEED TO REMOVE

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
QUICKLY IF THERE ARE NO

254
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
SURVIVORS BECAUSE OF FORENSICS,

255
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
WE GET BETTER INFORMATION IF WE

256
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
LEAVE THE BODIES THERE AND LET

257
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
THE EXPERTS COME IN.

258
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
>> WHAT A HORRID CRIME SCENE.

259
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
WHEN YOU STEP BACK AND LOCK AT

260
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
THIS AND WE WILL GO IN MORE

261
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
DETAILS WITH PSYCHOLOGISTS AND

262
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
FOLKS LIKE THAT, PEOPLE TALK

263
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
ABOUT THE PICK UP IF VIOLENCE

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
WHETHER IT IS THE SHOPPING MALL

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO OR AT THE

266
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
THEATER IN AURORA OR COLUMBINE

267
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
BEFORE THAT, AND JUST NOT IN

268
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
AMERICA WE HAVE SEEN SHOOTINGS,

269
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
HORRIBLE SHOOTINGS IN

270
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
SCANDINAVIA AND REPUBLIC OF

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
GEORGIA, IN FACT, IN

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
SCANDINAVIA, 50.
WHAT I AM ASKING, WHAT THE HECK

273
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
IS GOING ON?

274
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
>>Guest: WELL, HERE IS THE

275
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
REALITY.

276
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOW THAT THE

277
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
SITUATIONS APPEAR TO BE

278
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
INCREASING AND THERE ARE A

279
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
NUMBER OF REASONS.

280
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I WILL LEAVE THAT TO THE VIEWERS

281
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
DECIDE WHY THEY THING THEY ARE

282
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
INCREASING.

283
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I AM HERE IN MINNESOTA TODAY

284
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
TEACHING A COURT JUST THIS

285
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
MORNING ON ACTIONS OF CHILDREN

286
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
IN A SCHOOL SYSTEM BECAUSE WE

287
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
REALIZE JUST TODAY I WAS

288
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
SPEAKING WHEN ONE OF THE

289
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
STUDENTS SAID THERE IS A

290
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
SHOOTING GOING ON IN

291
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
CONNECTICUT.
I AM NOT SURPRISED.

292
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
WE AS A NATION, WE HAVE TO COME

293
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
UP WITH A POLICY THAT ADDRESSES

294
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
THE MEMBERSHIP TALL ILL, NOT THE

295
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
GUNS BUT THE MENTAL MILLNESS AND

296
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.

297
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN TALKING

298
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
ABOUT THERE?

299
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
FOR YEARS.

300
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
WE KNOW THIS IS A REALITY.

301
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.

302
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
>>Neil: WE HAVE TO STOP

303
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
MEETING LIKE THIS BUT THANK YOU

304
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
FOR YOUR EXPERTISE.

305
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
NOW A PSYCHOLOGIST, DOCTOR, WHY

306
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
SO MUCH OF THERE AND WHY WE ARE

307
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
SEEING MORE THIS OR APPEAR TO.

308
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
ARE WE?

309
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
>>Guest: IT SURE SEEMS LIKE

310
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
IT.

311
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
THIS IS AS BAD AS IT GETS.

312
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
THE CHILDREN, MY OFFICE THIS

313
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
MORNING HAS BEEN OVERWHELM BY

314
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
CALLS FROM PARENTS IN LOS

315
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
ANGELES TRAUMAIZED BY THIS

316
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
BECAUSE WE ALL IDENTIFY WITH THE

317
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
KIDS.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, I

318
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
HAVE TO SAY IT IS SO MANY

319
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
FACTORS.

320
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
YOU HAVE THE BREAKDOWN OF

321
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
VALUES.
YOU HAVE THE BREAKDOWN OF

322
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
STRUCTURES THAT HELD US

323
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
TOGETHER.

324
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
MORALLY, SPIRITUALLY, TOO MANY

325
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
FACTORS TO TALK ABOUT.

326
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
THE OFFICERS' POINT WAS

327
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
IMPORTANT, WHEN PEOPLE ARE MORE

328
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
EDUCATED ABOUT WHAT TO LOOK FOR

329
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
IN THE MENTALLY ILL AND THOSE

330
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
WHO HAVE DARK LIKES WHERE YOU

331
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
SEE THE CLUES WHICH WILL

332
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
PROBABLY EMERGE, THE MORE

333
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
AWARENESS EVERYONE GETS, WE CAN

334
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
ALL BE HELPED BY THAT.

335
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
>>Neil: WHY KIDS, DOCTOR, WHEN

336
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
THESE INCIDENTS HAPPEN?

337
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
MOST THESE WERE KINDERGARTENERS.

338
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
>>Guest: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

339
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
THAT ALL MORNING.

340
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
IN SOME WAYS IT IS ONE OF THOSE

341
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
UNANSWERABLES.

342
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
YOU CAN ALWAYS SEE A PATH.

343
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
THERE IS MENTAL ILLNESS THAT CAN

344
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
CAUSE THINGS LIKE THIS.

345
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
THERE IS HORRIBLE LIFE STORIES

346
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
BUT THE REALITY IS NOT EVERYONE

347
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
WHO IS MENTALLY ILL COMMITS AN

348
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
ACT LIKE THIS.

349
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
NOT EVERYONE ABUSED AS A CHILD

350
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
DOES THIS.

351
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
THIS IS A LINE OF THE HEART OR

352
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
THE SOUL OR THEIR SPIRIT THAT

353
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
SOME PEOPLE GO ONE WAY AND

354
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
OTHERS GO THE OTHER.

355
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
THE BIG THING IS WE DO KNOW THE

356
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
GREAT THEMES OF ISOLATION AND

357
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
POWERLESSNESS IN INDIVIDUALS'

358
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
LIKES SOW THIS AND WE DO AS PAST

359
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
WE CAN IN SPOTTING THAT AND

360
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
TRYING TO END THEM.

361
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
IF SOMETHING LOOKS YEAR, CALL

362
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
SOMEONE.

363
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
>> DOCTOR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> ON THE DAY YOU CANNOT MAKE

364
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
SENSE OF STUFF, MANY OF THE

365
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
KINDERGARTENERS AND OTHER YOUNG

366
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
KIDS WHO WERE KILLED IN THE

367
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
TRAGEDY WERE PARTICIPATING IN

368
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
THE SCHOOL'S ANNUAL HOLIDAY

369
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
CHRISTMAS PERFORMANCE AND THEY

370
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
ARE ALL DEAD.

371
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
HAVING YOU SHIP MY GIFTS
COULDN'T BE EASIER.

372
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
WELL, HAVING A TON OF LOCATIONS
DOESN'T HURT.

373
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
AND A SANTA TO BOOT!

374
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
[ chuckles ]

569
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
HE MAY OR MAY NOT BE

570
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED AND

571
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
WENT TO THE SCHOOL AND WAS

572
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
BUZZED IN THE FRONT DOOR.

573
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
THE SCHOOL WAS ON LOCKDOWN.

574
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
HE WAS BUZZED IN WITH THESE

575
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
WEAPONS AND HE WALKED IN THE

576
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
OFFICE AND OPENED FIRE GOING

577
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
AFTER THE PRINCIPAL.

578
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST.

579
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
AND OTHERS IN THAT OFFICE.

580
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
IT WAS DURING MORNING

581
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
ANNOUNCEMENTS SO WHAT HAPPENED

582
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
WHILE THE ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE

583
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
BEING MADE THE REST OF THE

584
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
SCHOOL, THE STUDENTS AND THE

585
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
TEACHERS COULD HEAR THE VIOLENCE

586
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
AND SHOTS OVER THE SCHOOL

587
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
INTERCOM AND THE SHOOTER WENT TO

588
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
A CLASSROOM AND OPENED FIRE

589
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
TARGETING THE KIDS.

590
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
WE KNOW THE DEATH TOLL IS

591
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
DEPARTMENT CHILDREN AND SEX

592
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
ADULTS.

593
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
THE SHOOTER THEN TURNED THE GUN

594
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
ON HIMSELF THE THEY HAVE NOT

595
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
SAID WHY THE STUDENTS MAY HAVE

596
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
BEEN TARGETED AND THEY DO NOT

597
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
KNOW WHAT THE EXACT BREAKDOWN

598
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
IS, THE NUMBERS ARE CONFUSING IN

599
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
THE EARLY GOING BUT WE HAVE

600
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
GOTTEN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE

601
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
SHOOTER BEING 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM

602
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
LANZA.
RYAN IS BEING QUESTIONED.

603
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
WE DO NOT KNOW THE FATHER IS

604
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
INVOLVED IN THIS AT ALL BUT HE

605
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
IS ALIVE.

606
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
SOMEONE IS DEAD IN HOBOKEN, NEW

607
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
JERSEY, AND NOW WE HEAR THE

608
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
GIRLFRIEND OF RYAN LANZA IS

609
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
MISSING TO ADD ANOTHER TWIST TO

610
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
THIS.

611
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
>>Neil: THANK YOU, TRACE.

612
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
ALSO, CORRECTING SOMETHING I

613
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
SAID EARLIER, THERE WERE SEMI

614
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FOUND AT THE

615
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
SCENE, NOT AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

616
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
THAT WAS HIGH DAD AND THEY WROTE

617
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
IT THAT WAY AND I SAID AUTOMATIC

618
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
BUT THEY WERE SEMI-AUTOMATIC

619
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
WEAPONS SO MY APOLOGIES.

620
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
WHAT DO WE MAKE OF THAT?

621
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
>>Guest: IT IS A VERY COMMON

622
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
MISNOMER BECAUSE THE

623
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
SEMI-AUTOMATICS ARE SO FAST WE

624
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
ARE CUTTING HAIRS.

625
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TWO ASSAULT

626
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
RIFLES, BRA -- BRUTAL WEAPONS.

627
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
HE WAS LOADED FOR MASS KILLING.

628
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
HE WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL.

629
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
>>Neil: THIS WAS CLEARLY IN

630
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
YOUR EYES PREMEDITATEED,

631
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
PREEXAMINED, PREIN THE OUT.

632
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
>>Guest: WELL-THOUGHT-OUT TO

633
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
MAKE CERTAIN HE HAD THE

634
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
BULLET-PROOF VEST ON, ON THE

635
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
OUTSIDE CHANCE AS WE TALKED AT

636
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
THE HOMICIDE IN THE MALL IN

637
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
OREGON, THAT ONE COULD BE ARMED

638
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
THAT COULD SHOOT AT HIM THE HE

639
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
WANTED TO PROTECT HIMSELF SO HE

640
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
COULD FINISH THIS BIZARRE

641
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
TWISTED MISSION.

642
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
THAT IS SERIOUS WEAPONS HE

643
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
BROUGHT IN.

644
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
>>Neil: IN SOME OF THE SCHOOL

645
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
INCIDENTS I WILL TAKE VIRGINIA

646
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
TECH OUT OF IT, AND COLLEGE

647
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
KIDS, BUT IN THESE INCIDENTS AND

648
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
NOT EVEN IN THE UNITED STATES

649
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
BUT IT HAPPENED ABROAD WHERE

650
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
THERE ARE VERY TOUGH GUN LAWS

651
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
AND WHY WANT TO GET IF THAT

652
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
DEBATE, BUT, WHY KIDS IN WHY

653
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
TARGET KIDS?

654
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
>>Guest: I TALKED TO THE

655
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
MAYOR, THE SAME THING CAME UP

656
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
AND HE BROUGHT UP A GREAT POINT.

657
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
THERE IS JUST, SPECULATION, THAT

658
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
SUCH EXTRAORDINARY

659
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
SUGGESTIBILITY THAT IS

660
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
BOMBARDING THEM EVERY SECOND

661
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
WITH THE WAY SOCIETY HAS EVOLVED

662
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
IN THE LAST 15 YEARS IN

663
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
TEMPERATURES OF THE MEDICINIA,

664
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
THAT MAYBE IT HAS DIMINISH THE

665
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
OR MINIMIZED IT, THE VIOLENCE,

666
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
WHERE IT IS ALMOST LIKE A VIDEO

667
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
GAME.
I THEORIZE THAT.

668
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I AM IN THIS BUSINESS 30 YEARS

669
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
AND MY VERY STRONG CONVICTION,

670
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
IT IS MIGHT THEIR STUFF.

671
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
>>Neil: HE WIPED OUT ALMOST AN

672
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
ENTIRE CLASS AT A MINIMUM

673
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
REPORTEDLY THESE WERE STUDENTS

674
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
OF HIS MOTHER.

675
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
>>Guest: CORRECT.

676
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
>>Neil: WHAT DO YOU DO TO

677
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
PREVENT THAT IN THE FUTURE?

678
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
WHEN WE COVERED THE MALL

679
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
SHOOTING, YOU SAID MAYBE WE ARM

680
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
THE SECURITY GUARDS.

681
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
WHAT DO YOU DO IN SCHOOL?

682
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
>>Guest: WE BRING SCHOOL

683
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
SECURITY AT FIVE ELEMENTARY

684
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
SCHOOLS, 50 MILES FROM HERE.

685
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
A MIDDLE SCHOOL.

686
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
ALSO, ONE HIGH SCHOOL.

687
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
WE TOOK OVER THIS ASSIGNMENT WE

688
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
CHANGED THE FANS.

689
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
WE PUT IN NYPD POLICE CAPTAIN IN

690
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
CHARGE AND ALL ARMED EX-NYPD

691
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
HERE.
THE INTERESTING THING IS THE

692
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
PROBLEMS ARE GENERALLY AT THE

693
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
SCHOOLS AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

694
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
BECAUSE OF CUSTODY CASES AND

695
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
BIOLOGICAL PARENTS AND THAT IS

696
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
WHERE THE CROWE WILL DOOR.

697
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
THEY HAD A PROTOCOL IN PLACE A

698
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
BUZZER, VISITOR BUZZING IN

699
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
SYSTEM.
THAT DOESN'T WORK.

700
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
>>Neil: BUT IF SOMEONE IS

701
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
INTENT AND YOU JUST GO IN THERE

702
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
WITH GUNS BLAZING NOTHING WILL

703
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
HAVE A SHORT LASTING EFFECT.

704
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
>>Guest: I AGREE.

705
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
THE FACT IS THOSE ARE GIGANTIC

706
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
RIFLES.
THEY CAME IN THE BUILDING, ONE

707
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
GUY, WITH TWO VERY LARGE RIFLES.

708
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
YOU CAN HIDE THE HANDGUNS.

709
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
IT COULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED BY

710
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
THE APPROPRIATE SECURITY.

711
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
FORGET THE METAL DETECTOR,

712
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
SOMEONE WHO IS ARMED AND TRAINED

713
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
WITH THE EXPERIENCE TO STOP THEM

714
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
DEAD IN HIS TRACKS, LET HIM GO

715
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000

716

>>Neil: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

719
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
WE DO KNOW THAT 20 CHILDREN ARE

720
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
NOT GOING TO GO FOR MILK AND

721
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
COOKIES.
ARE NOT GOING TO ENEYE

722
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
CHRISTMAS.
THEIR FAMILIES ARE NOT, EITHER.

723
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
FOR A TOWN THAT WAS PART OF A

724
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
COMMUNITY AS RICH AS ALL GET

725
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000

PRIZED IN THE NATION, IT

727
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
HAPPENED.

728

LONG ROAD AHEAD OF THEM AND THEY

828
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
SHOULD SEEK HELP FOR THEIR OWN

829
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
SELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN AS

830
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000

831
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
FROM MY OWN SITUATION, I DIDN'T

832
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
REALIZE IT WOULD BE SUCH A LONG

833
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
ROAD.
THE REAL NIGHTMARE IS AFTER ALL

834
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
THE DUST SETTLES.

835
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000

JONES BOTHER SCHOOL SHOOTINGS

867
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
HAPPENED AND IT IS ONE THOSE

868
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
DAYS I START RELIVING ALL OVER

869
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
AGAIN TODAY.

870
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
WHEN I HEAR THAT MOTHER TALK ONE

871
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
OF THE THINGS PEOPLE WILL NOT

872
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
FULLY COMPREHEND EVERY

873
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
TELEVISION CAMERA IN THE WORLD

874
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
WILL DESCEND UPON NEWTOWN,

875
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
CONNECTICUT, OVER THE WEEKEND

876
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
AND THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AND

877
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
THEY WILL ALL LEAVE AND COVER

878
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
SOMETHING ELSE.

879
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
ALL THESE PEOPLE WILL STILL HAVE

880
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
THE SCARS, EMOTIONALLY AND MANY

881
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
THEM PHYSICALLY, IF YEARS TO

882
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
COME.
RIGHT NOW, WHAT IS VERY HARMFUL

883
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
IS SO MUCH ATTENTION BUT SO

884
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
LITTLE VALID INFORMATION.

885
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING TO ME AND

886
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
OTHER OFFICIALS BECAUSE SO MANY

887
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
PEOPLE WERE SPECULATING WHAT

888
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
HAPPENED, WHO DID IT, WHY DID

889
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
THEY DO IT, AND WE DON'T KNOW

890
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
THOSE THINGS.

891
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I DO BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE

892
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO AT

893
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
THIS POINT IS TO TAKE IT VERY,

894
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
VERY CALMLY, AND SLOWLY, BUT THE

895
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
BIGGEST AFTERMATH OF SOMETHING

896
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
LIKE THIS, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

897
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
LOOK FOR, OKAY, WHY DID IT

898
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
HAPPEN?

899
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
THE ANSWER IS INEXPLICABLE.

900
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
WHAT DO WE DO TO STOP IT IN YOU

901
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
CAN TAKE CERTAIN MEASURES AND I

902
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
THINK YOUR PREVIOUS GUEST HAD A

903
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
LOT OF GREAT IDEAS WHICH IS VERY

904
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
IMPORTANT.

905
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
ULTIMATELY YOU CAN TAKE EVERY

906
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
GUN AWAY IN AMERICA CAN SOMEONE

907
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
WILL USE A BOMB WHEN SOMEONE HAS

908
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
AN INTENT TO DO INCREDIBLE

909
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
DAMAGE THEY WILL FIND A WAY.

910
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
IN THE CASE OF JONESBORO, AN 11

911
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
AND 12-YEAR-OLD KIDS WHO GUNNED

912
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
DOWN THEIR CLASSMATES AND

913
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
TEACHERS AFTER THEY HAD GOT THEM

914
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
IN A SCHOOL YARD BY SETTING OFF

915
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
A FIRE ALARM WHERE THEY WERE

916
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
TRAPPED IN A FENCED AREA AND

917
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
COULD NOT GET BACK IN.

918
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
THEY WERE SITTING DUCKS.

919
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
THE QUESTION, HOW CAN AN 11 AND

920
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
TELEPHONE-YEAR-OLD DO THIS?

921
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
NO ONE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THAT

922
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
CAN HAPPEN AND PEOPLE WILL WANT

923
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
TO PASS NEW LAWS BUT UNLESS YOU

924
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
CHANGE PEOPLE'S HEARTS OR

925

1125
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
CONFIRMED 26 PEOPLE WERE FOUND

1126
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
DEAD INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.

1127
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
WERE KILLED IN THAT SHOOTING.

THE SCHOOL, INCLUDING THE

1132
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
SHOOTER WHO WE ARE TOLD NOW BYWT

1133
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
SOURCES IS 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM

1134
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
LANZA.

1135
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
INITIALLY PEOPLE IDENTIFIED

1136
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
THE SHOOTER AS 24-YEAR-OLD

1137
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
RYAN LANZA.

1138
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
THAT IS ADAM'S BROTHER.

1139
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
APPARENTLY, ADAM MAY HAVE BEEN

1140
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
CARRYING RYAN'S I.D. AND

1141
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
THAT'S WHY THERE WAS CONFUSION

1142
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
INITIALLY.
WE'RE TOLD THAT THE SHOOTER

1143
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
WAS ADAM.
HIS BROTHER IS NOW BEING

1144
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
QUESTIONED BY AUTHORITIES IN

1145
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY.

1146
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
WE'RE TOLD ADAM'S MOTHER WAS

1147
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
KILLED AND A BODY WAS FOUND

1148
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
INSIDE THE PARENT'S HOME IN

1149
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1150
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
IT'S UNCLEAR WHO THAT BODY IS.

1151
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
THERE WERE REPORTS THAT THE

1152
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
FATHER HAD BEEN KILLED BUT WE

1153
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
CAN'T CONFIRM THAT.

1154
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
A SWAT TEAM WENT TO THE HOUSE

1155
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
TO EXECUTE A SEARCH WARRANT.

1156
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
THEY WENT THROUGH THE DOOR AND

1157
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
THEN THEY IMMEDIATELY BACKED

1158
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
OUT BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT

1159
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
POSSIBLE BOOBBYTRAP.

1160
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
THEY SENT IN A ROBOT AND THE

1161
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
ROBOT IDENTIFIED A BODY INSIDE

1162
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
THE HOUSE.

1163
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
CRIME SCENE ONGOING, AND

1164
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING.

1165
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
THEY'RE STILL CONTINUING TO

1166
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
TRY TO RECOVER THE FRED THAT

1167
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
HOME.
STILL AT THAT SCHOOL, NEIL,

1168
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
BECAUSE THE BODIES ARE INSIDE.

1169
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
A LOT HAS TO BE PROCESSED,

1170
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
PHOTOGRAPHS, DIAGRAMS MADE

1171
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
BEFORE THEY BEGIN REMOVING

1172
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
BODIES FROM THE SCHOOL.

1173
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
>> Neil: IF YOU COULD HANG

1174
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000

MAINE.

1179
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
NO DOUBT IN LIGHT OF THE

1180
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
DEVELOPMENTS.

1181
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
ON WHAT AUTHORITY ARE LOOKING

1182
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
FOR?
THEY KNOW THE SHOOTER.

1183
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
THEY KNOW HE IS APPARENTLY

1184
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
FIRST WENT AFTER HIS MOTHER.

1185
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
HE KNEW ENOUGH AT THE SCHOOL

1186
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
TO TARGET PRESUMABLY HER

1187
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
CLASS.

1188
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I SEE IT'S BEGINNING.

1189
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000

AGAIN, AS I STATED BEFORE.

1196
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
THIS IS ANGOING CRIMINAL

1197
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
INVESTIGATION.
WE ARE LIMITED AS TO SOME OF

1198
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
THE DETAILS WE CAN GIVE OUT TO

1199
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000

THE HOSPITAL, SECONDARY CRIME

1204
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
SCENE.

IT'S THE POLICY AND PROTOCOL

1208
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
VICTIMS.

1209
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
THAT IS A TIME CONSUMING

1210
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
PROCESS AND SOMETHING THAT

1211
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
WILL TAKE TIME.

1212
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER ARRIVED

1213
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
