1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
>> THIS MORNING WE REMEMBER

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
THOSE LOST.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
>> THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
AHEAD OF THEM, BIRTHDAYS,

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
GRADUATIONS, WEDDINGS.

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
>> AND ASK WHY.
>> THIS WAS NOT GOD'S PLAN.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
THIS WAS A MAN WHO HAS SERIOUS

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
ISSUES IN HIS LIFE.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
>> AND NOW AS AMERICA GRIEVES,

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
HOW SHOULD OUR LEADERS RESPOND?

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
WHAT CAN ALL OF US DO TO STOP

12
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
THIS SENSELESS VIOLENCE?

13
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
>> WE WILL FIND A WAY TO HEAL.

14
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
>> WE'LL GET TO THE HEART OF

15
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
THOSE QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW.

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000

THIS IS WHERE THE 20 CHILDREN

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
KILLED AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

28
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
WOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO LEARN

29
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
AND GROW.

30
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM NEWTOWN

31
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
HIGH SCHOOL WHERE PRESIDENT

COMMUNITY STILL IN SHOCK.

36
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
THE HEARTBREAK HERE IS MAGNIFIED

37
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
BY THE AGE OF ALMOST ALL THE

38
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000

OVERNIGHT THE SHOOTER'S FATHER,

42
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
PETER LANZA, RELEASED HIS FIRST

43
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
PUBLIC STATEMENT.

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
"WE ARE IN A STATE OF DISBELIEF

45
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
AND TRYING TO FIND WHATEVER

ANSWERS WE CAN.

47
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
WE TOO ARE ASKING WHY."

48
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
AND THIS MORNING AMERICA IS

49
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
HONORING THE VICTIMS.

50
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
TODAY EVERY NFL TEAM WILL

51
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
OBSERVE A MOMENT OF SILENCE
BEFORE THE GAMES.

52
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
THE GIANTS AND PATRIOTS WILL

53
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
WEAR SPECIAL DECALS ON THEIR

54
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000

OUR GUESTS AND EXPERTS ARE

55
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
STANDING BY FOR A CONVERSATION

56
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
ON WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY TO CUSS

57
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
WHAT IT MEANS TO

58
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION,

59
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
THAT'S PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PHRASE

60
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
AND A SHATTERING MOMENT OF

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
MINDLESSNESS.

62
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
>>> THE LATEST ON THE

63
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
INVESTIGATION, BRIAN ROSS OUR

64
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE
CORRESPONDENT AND, BRIAN,

65
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE BEGINNING TO

66
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
PIECE TOGETHER WHAT HAPPENED IN

67
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
THAT TERRIFYING TEN MINUTES IN
THE SCHOOL.

68
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE, THEY

69
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
SAY THEY ARE MAKING GOOD

70
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
PROGRESS IN KNOWING MUCH OF THE
HOW, ALTHOUGH LESS OF THE WHY OF

71
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
THE STUNNING CRIME.

72
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
IN PARTICULAR, THEY ARE FOCUSING

73
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
ON THE WEAPONS USED, THERE WERE

74
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
THREE WEAPONS RECOVERED, TWO

75
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
HANDGUNS AND A SEMIAUTOMATIC

76
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
ASSAULT-STYLE RIFLE THAT

77
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
AUTHORITIES BELIEVE WAS OWNED

78
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
ACTUALLY BY

79
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
ADAM LANZA'S MOTHER, NANCY.

80
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
HER FRIENDS SAY SHE WAS A GUN

81
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
ENTHUSIAST WHO BOUGHT THE

82
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
WEAPONS FOR SELF-DEFENSE WHEN
SHE WAS DIVORCED AND LIVED IN A

83
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
LARGE HOME BY HERSELF AND OFTEN

84
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
TOOK HER SONS, HER FRIENDS SAY,

85
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
TO A NEARBY FIRING RANGE FOR
TARGET PRACTICE.

86
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
>> SO THEY CONFIRM THAT THE

87
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
WEAPONS BELONGED TO HER, BUT

88
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
THERE HAD ALSO BEEN SOME

89
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
REPORTS, AT LEAST ONE IN THE

90
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
"L.A. TIMES" THAT THE SHOOTER
MAY HAVE TRIED TO BUY A WEAPON

91
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
RECENTLY.

92
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
>> OUR REPORTING DOESN'T CONFIRM

93
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
THAT, AND THE FACT IS IN

94
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
CONNECTICUT, THERE IS A WAITING

95
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
PERIOD TO BUY ANY WEAPON.

96
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
YOU NEED A PERMIT TO BUY A

97
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
HANDGUN, NOT A LONG RIFLE, BUT

98
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
EVEN SO THERE IS A WAITING

99
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
PERIOD, AND IF THERE WAS AN

100
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
ATTEMPT TO BUY ONE IN A SHORT

101
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
PERIOD OF TIME, THAT WOULDN'T

102
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
WORK.
>> THERE HAD ALSO BEEN SOME

103
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
INFORMATION EARLIER THAT THE

104
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
SHOOTER'S MOM MAY HAVE HAD SOME

105
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
CONNECTION TO SANDY HOOK, MAY

106
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
HAVE BEEN A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER

107
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
OR A VOLUNTEER THERE, BUT THE

108
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
SUPERINTENDENT HAS SAID THAT IS
NOT THE CASE.

109
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
DO WE HAVE ANY BETTER IDEA OF

110
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
WHY ADAM LANZA CHOSE THIS

111
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
SCHOOL?
>> WELL, THE SUPERINTENDENT HAS

112
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
SAID THAT THE MOTHER, NANCY

113
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
LANZA, DID NOT WORK THERE, SHE

114
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
WAS NOT A TEACHER, BUT HER

115
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
RELATIVES SAY SHE DID VOLUNTEER

116
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
AS A TEACHER'S AIDE AT SANDY

117
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
HOOK APPARENTLY AROUND THE SAME

118
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
TIME THAT ADAM WAS A STUDENT

119
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
THERE.

120
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
HE WAS A TROUBLED YOUNG MAN,

121
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
ACCORDING TO FRIENDS, AND

122
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
ACCORDING TO RELATIVES, NANCY

123
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
HAD MANY ISSUES WITH THE SCHOOL

124
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
DISTRICT ABOUT HOW THEY WERE

125
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
TREATING HIM AND HANDLING HIS

126
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
PARTICULAR SPECIAL NEEDS, SO IT

127
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
MAY HAVE BEEN A SOURCE OF

128
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
CONFLICT, AND AT ONE POINT
ACCORDING TO THE AUNT OF ADAM,

129
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
THE MOTHER PULLED ADAM OUT OF

130
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND

131
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
HOME-SCHOOLED HIM BECAUSE OF HER

132
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
UNHAPPINESS WITH THE WAY HE

133
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
WAS BEING TREATED AT SCHOOL.

134
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
>> AND THE POLICE ALSO SPENT AN

135
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
AWFUL LOT OF TIME AT THE HOME

136
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
WHICH IS ALSO A CRIME SCENE FOR

137
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
WHERE THE MOTHER WAS MURDERED.

138
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
WHAT ELSE HAVE THEY BEEN ABLE TO

139
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
FIND INSIDE THAT HOME?

140
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
>> WELL, THEY SAY THEY HAVE MADE

141
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
GOOD PROGRESS FROM EVIDENCE

142
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
FOUND IN THE HOME UNSPECIFIED AS
TO THE WHY AND THE MOTIVE.

143
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS

144
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A

145
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
NOTE OR SOME SORT OF

146
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
A VIDEO, BUT THEY SAY THEY ARE

147
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
MAKING PROGRESS IN DETERMINING A

148
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
MOTIVE HERE THAT WAS INVOLVED IN

149
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
WHICH, YOU KNOW, HE STARTED THE

150
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
DAY BY SHOOTING HIS MOTHER AND

151
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
THEN DROVE ABOUT TEN MINUTES TO

152
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
THE SCHOOL.
SO HE HAD A VERY DETERMINED

153
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
MISSION IN HIS HEAD WHEN HE

154
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
STARTED THAT DAY FRIDAY.
>> I SAW ONE REPORT THAT THE

155
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
HARD DRIVE, THE HARD DRIVE OF

156
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
HIS COMPUTER AT HIS HOME HAD

157
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
BEEN BROKEN.

158
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
IS THAT TRUE?
>> WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

159
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
CONFIRM THAT.

160
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REPORTS.

161
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
THE POLICE SAY THEY'RE PURPOSELY

162
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
KEEPING A LOT OF THINGS CLOSE TO

163
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
THE VEST AS THEY PUT TOGETHER A
FULL PICTURE.

164
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THE BEST INFORMATION REALLY

165
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
ABOUT ADAM AND HIS BACKGROUND

166
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
COMES FROM FORMER CLASSMATES WHO

167
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
ATTENDED SCHOOL WITH HIM AND SAY

168
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
HE WAS AWKWARD AND SOCIALLY VERY

169
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
ILL AT EASE

170
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
AROUND PEOPLE, DIDN'T LIKE TO BE

171
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
TALKED TO.

172
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
HE WAS A MEMBER OF

173
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
THE TECH CLUB AT HIS HIGH

174
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
SCHOOL.

175
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
FRIENDS SAY HE WAS

176
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
VERY BRIGHT, VERY SMART, BUT

177
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
WITHDRAWN.

178
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
>> BUT THE MYSTERY STILL WHY HE

179
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
DID THIS.

180
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
>> THAT REMAINS A SERIOUS
QUESTION.

181
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME

182
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
CONNECTION, AT LEAST IN HIS
TWISTED WAY OF THINKING, THAT

183
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
PUT HIM ON THAT PATH, BUT IT'S

184
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
NOT CERTAIN YET JUST WHAT THAT

185
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
WAS, GEORGE.

299
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
>> FRIDAY IT WAS CLEAR TO ME

300
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
THAT THERE WAS A RELUCTANCE TO

301
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
SPEAK TO THE FAMILIES, BUT IT

302
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000

303
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
EVERYTHING WE NEEDED TO KNOW AT

304
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
THAT POINT, SO IT FELL UPON MY

305
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
SHOULDERS TO INFORM THE FAMILY

306
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
OF WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED AND THAT

307
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
THEIR LOVED ONE WOULDN'T BE

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
JOINING THEM AGAIN, AND IT WAS A

309
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
TO PROTECT CHILDREN.

320
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH THE

321
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000

THOSE DETAILS WERE BREAKING,

327
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
THERE WAS A SENSE OF PRIDE, BUT

328
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
OBVIOUSLY PROFOUND LOSS THAT SHE

329
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
TRIED TO SHIELD CHILDREN FROM

330
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
THE EFFECTS OF THOSE GUN ROUNDS.

331
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
>> WHAT MORE CAN THE STATE DO

332
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
FOR THIS COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW?
>> WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE

333
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
CAN, AND I'VE MADE IT PERFECTLY

334
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
CLEAR FROM THE MOMENT THAT WE

335
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
WERE NOTIFIED THAT WHATEVER

336
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY, TO HELP

337
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
THE COMMUNITY RESTORE ITSELF AS

338
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000

339
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
HELPING WITH THE SCHOOL

340
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
BUILDING, WORKING WITH OTHER

341
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT

342
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
THERE'S ENOUGH CLASSROOMS, THERE

343
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
WILL BE A GREAT NUMBER OF
FUNERALS.

344
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
WE HAVE ASSETS READY, STATE

345
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
QUITE FRANKLY.

348
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I THINK THE FIRST HAS DONE A

349
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
TREMENDOUS JOB, THE POLICE CHIEF

350
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
IS PERFORMING AT HIGH STANDARDS,

351
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
A SMALL DEPARTMENT IN A SMALL
COMMUNITY.

352
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
THEY NEED HELP, AND WE'LL GIVE

353
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
IT.

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
>> YOU'RE HELPING, AS YOU JUST

355
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
SAID, THE POLICE CHIEF.

356
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
WHAT CAN YOU SHARE?

357
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
IT SEEMS LIKE THIS MAN HAD A

358
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
PRETTY COMMITTED PLAN.

359
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
>> HE SHOT HIS WAY INTO THE

360
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
SCHOOL.
THE SCHOOL WAS LOCKED.

361
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
HE USED A WEAPON TO OPEN UP THE

362
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
GLASS AND THEN --

363
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
>> HE BLASTED RIGHT THROUGH IT.

364
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000

NUMBER OF ROUNDS.

365
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
HE DISCHARGED TO MAKE AN OPENING

366
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
AND THEN WENT THROUGH IT, WENT

367
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
TO THE FIRST CLASSROOM, AS YOU

368
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
KNOW, WENT TO THE SECOND

369
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
CLASSROOM.

370
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
WE SURMISE THAT IT WAS DURING

371
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
THE SECOND CLASSROOM EPISODE

372
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
THAT HE HEARD RESPONDERS COMING

373
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
AND APPARENTLY AT THAT DECIDED

374
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE.

375
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
>> AND THE RESPONSE WAS PRETTY

376
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
QUICK, WITHIN TEN MINUTES.

377
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
>> IT WAS TO THE BEST OF MY

378
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
KNOWLEDGE PRETTY QUICK FROM THE

379
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
TIME THAT THE CALL WAS MADE AND

380
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
THE CALL OF THE FIRST CALL WE

381
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
BELIEVE WAS MADE BY ONE OF THE

382
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE THAT WAS

383
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
INJURED, BUT WILL RECOVER,

384
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY ADDITIONAL

385
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
CALLS WERE MADE AFTER THAT.

386
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS SICK FELLOW,

387
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
YOU KNOW, CLEARLY MENTALLY ILL,

388
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
KILLED HIS MOTHER, PROCEEDED TO

389
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
GO ON AND KILL A GREAT NUMBER OF

390
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
PEOPLE.

391
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
>> YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOU'VE HAD
TO DEAL WITH EMOTIONAL ISSUES IN

392
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
YOUR OWN FAMILY, AND THERE'S

393
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
SOME STATISTICS I'VE SEEN,
CONNECTICUT'S MENTAL HEALTH

394
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
SYSTEM PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR

395
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
LESS THAN ONE IN FIVE

396
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
CONNECTICUT RESIDENTS.

397
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
IS THERE ANYTHING MORE THAT CAN

398
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
OR SHOULD BE DONE TO ADDRESS

399
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
THESE YOUNG MEN DRIVEN BY

400
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
DEMONS?

401
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M NOT SURE
WHICH STATISTICS YOU'RE USING,

402
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY STARTED A

403
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
PROGRAM WELL AHEAD OF CHANGES TO

404
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
THE NATIONAL MEDICAID POLICY SO

405
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
WE ACTUALLY HAVE 83,000 PEOPLE

406
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
COVERED IN OUR STATE WHO
WOULDN'T BE COVERED IN ANY OTHER

407
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
STATE RIGHT NOW.

408
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
IT'S AN EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION,

409
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE.

410
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
WE ALSO DO PUT A GREAT DEAL OF

411
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
CREDENCE AND IMPORTANCE, I

412
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
SHOULD SAY, ON MENTAL HEALTH.

413
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I THINK OUR COUNTRY NEEDS TO

414
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
STEP IT UP QUITE A BIT IN THAT

415
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
REGARD.

416
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
WE NEED TO REACH OUT TO FAMILIES

417
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
THAT ARE IN CRISIS, AND IT

418
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
APPEARS THAT THERE WAS A CRISIS

419
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
IN THIS FAMILY.

420
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
THEY NEED TO KNOW THERE WERE

421
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
RESOURCES.

422
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
HAVING SAID THAT ALL,

423
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
THE FAMILY HAD THE RESOURCES
PERSONALLY TO HANDLE THE

424
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
SITUATION BY ALL APPEARANCES.

425
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE

426
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
DIFFICULT ISSUES.

427
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I THINK OUR NATION NEEDS TO TAKE

428
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO

429
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
MENTAL HEALTH, AND WE NEED TO

430
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
SPEAK ABOUT IT MORE HONESTLY

431
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
JUST AS WE NEED TO DO OTHER

432
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
THINGS.

433
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
>> AND, FINALLY, PRESIDENT OBAMA

434
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
COMING TO NEWTOWN TONIGHT.

435
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
WHAT DOES THE COMMUNITY HERE

436
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
WANT TO HEAR FROM HIM?

437
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
>> WELL, I THINK AN

438
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
EXPRESSION BY THE PRESIDENT OF

439
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
THE UNITED STATES THAT HE

440
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
UNDERSTANDS THE DIFFICULTY THAT

441
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
THIS COMMUNITY IS GOING THROUGH

442
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
IS, I THINK, GREATLY APPRECIATED

443
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
BY THE COMMUNITY.

444
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I THINK WHAT MOTIVATES THE

445
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
PRESIDENT IS HIS DESIRE TO TOUCH

446
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WANT TO

447
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION, WHO WANT

448
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
TO BE ASSURED THAT THE PRESIDENT

449
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
OF THE UNITED STATES UNDERSTANDS

450
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
THAT THE PAIN THAT THEY'RE

451
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
SUFFERING FROM, AND I SUPPOSE

452
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
THAT THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS IN

453
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
THAT SESSION WITH THOSE PARENTS

454
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
OR THOSE SIBLINGS, BUT A LEVEL

455
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
OF REASSURANCE THAT THEY'LL GET

456
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
FROM THE VERY HIGHEST OFFICE IN

457
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
OUR NATION.
>> GOVERNOR DAN MALLOY, THANK

458
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
YOU VERY MUCH.

459
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
>> THANK YOU.

460
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
>>> LET ME TURN NOW TO SENATOR

461
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL AND ALSO --

462
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
SENATOR-ELECT AND

463
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
CONGRESSMAN CHRIS MURPHY HERE

464
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
WITH US.

465
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL, YOU SPENT

466
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
LAST OF THE 48 HOURS HERE.
>> I SPENT A GOOD PART OF THE

467
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
LAST TWO DAYS IN THIS COMMUNITY

468
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
AND I MUST, FIRST OF ALL, GIVE

469
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
ME THANKS TO THE GOVERNOR FOR

470
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
HIS STRENGTH AND

471
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
DETERMINATION BUT ALSO TO THE

472
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
COMMUNITY WHICH HAS REALLY COME

473
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
TOGETHER AND DEMONSTRATED A KIND

474
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
OF FIBER AND FAITH THAT IS

475
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
REMARKABLE.
I SPENT TIME IN THIS COMMUNITY

476
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
BEFORE AND ALWAYS BEEN IMPRESSED

477
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
BY THE REAL LINKS AND BONDS, THE

478
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
PEOPLE YOU KNOW AND THE

479
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
AMBULANCE AND

480
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
FIRE DEPARTMENT ARE LARGELY

481
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
VOLUNTEER, SO THAT MANY OF THE

482
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
HEROIC STORIES HERE ARE ABOUT

483
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
VOLUNTEERS COMING FORWARD AND
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS

484
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
SEARING, ALMOST UNBEARABLE PAIN

485
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
THAT SO MANY FEEL KNOWING THE

486
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
FAMILIES, KNOWING THE VICTIMS

487
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
AND, OF COURSE, AS A PARENT

488
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
MYSELF, FOUR CHILDREN, I CAN
REALLY HAVE SOME SENSE OF WHAT

489
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
THEY ARE GOING THROUGH.

490
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
>> AND, CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS IN

491
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
YOUR DISTRICT.

492
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
YOU'VE BEEN REPRESENTING IT FOR

493
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
MANY YEARS AND I'VE SEEN THIS IN

494
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

495
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT IS

496
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
TIGHTLY TIED TOGETHER TALKING TO
MONSIGNOR WEISS.

497
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
HE HAD BAPTIZED MANY OF T

498
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
CHILDREN IN THAT TOWN.

499
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
>> YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

500
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
NEWTOWN.
LABOR DAY PARADE THAT'S THE

501
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
PRIDE OF THIS COMMUNITY THAT

502
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
RUNS THROUGH MAIN STREET EVERY

503
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
YEAR, AND EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL

504
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
AND COMMUNITY GROUP PLANS THE

505
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
ENTIRE YEAR TO BE PART OF THAT

506
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
CELEBRATION OF AMERICA.

507
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
IT'S A SMALL TOWN, A VERY

508
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
TIGHTLY-KNIT TOWN, A TOWN THAT

509
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
GRIEVES PROBABLY A LITTLE DEEPER

510
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
BECAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT,

511
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
BECAUSE OF EVERYONE THAT WAS
TAKEN WAS WITHIN A FEW SQUARE

512
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
MILES OF EACH OTHER.

513
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
IT WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT BUT A
TOWN THAT CAN BE REBUILD BECAUSE

514
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
ITS FAITH IS SO STRONG AND

515
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
BECAUSE ITS TIES TO EACH OTHER

516
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
ARE SO STRONG.

517
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
THERE HAVE BEEN MIRACLES THAT

518
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
HAPPENED EVERY DAY SINCE THE

519
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
TRAGEDY HIT AND POINTS THE WAY

520
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
TOWARDS THE WAY BECAUSE OF

521
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
NEWTOWN BECAUSE OF ITS

522
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
CLOSE-KNIT STRUCTURE CAN HEAL.

523
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
>> THE SCHOOLS HERE WILL BE

524
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
CLOSED TOMORROW.
WHAT IS THE STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

525
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
GOING FORWARD AFTER THAT?

526
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
>> WELL, I THINK THAT'S GOING TO
BE A CONSULTATION WITH THE FIRST

527
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
SELECT WOMAN AND THE BOARD OF

528
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
EDUCATION.

529
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

530
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
STUDENTS AND FOR FACULTY TO BE

531
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
ABLE TO PROCESS THIS TOGETHER,

532
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
AND SO I THINK THERE IS A NEED

533
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
FOR THIS COMMUNITY TO GET BACK

534
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
TO SOME SEMBLANCE OF A SCHEDULE.

535
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
BUT EACH INDIVIDUAL FACULTY

536
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
MEMBER AND EACH INDIVIDUAL

537
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
STUDENT, FAMILIES WILL TAKE

538
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
THEIR OWN TIME SO I THINK WE ARE

539
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
STILL 48 HOURS OUT

540
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
FROM THIS INCIDENT

541
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

542
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
THINK ABOUT IT, NEVER MIND THE

543
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS OF GRIEVING

544
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
AND RECONSTRUCTING THE
COMMUNITY.

545
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
IT WILL TAKE A WHILE.
>> SENATOR, I KNOW THAT YOU AS

546
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
WE MOVE ON WANT TO BEGIN A

547
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
CONVERSATION IN THE SENATE ABOUT

548
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
HOW THE COUNTRY CAN COME

549
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THIS
VIOLENCE.

550
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
>> YOU KNOW, I COME TO THIS

551
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
ISSUE WITH A BACKGROUND OF

552
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000

THIS CAN BE A TIPPING POINT?

589
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
>> WELL, I THINK THE TIPPING

590
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
POINT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED A

591

ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS NO SIMPLE

595

SOLUTION AND, YES, THERE HAS TO

596
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000

CONTROL BUT THE WAY WE TREAT

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
NO RETURN.

700
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
THEY ARE NOT BIODEGRADABLE.

701
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
THEY'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

702
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
YOU WOULD HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW

703
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
TO REMOVE THEM FROM THE STREETS.

704
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000

ONE WEAPON PER MINUTE WAS TURNED

715
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000

719
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000

723

SYSTEMS APPROACH BECAUSE THERE

724
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000

WORKING THROUGH OUR SHOOTING

728

WE'VE HAD TO TRY TO LIMIT THE

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
INCIDENT DOES NOT SEND A MESSAGE

734
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
THAT SOME STRONGER AND IMMEDIATE

735
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
ACTION NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN OUR

736
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
COUNTRY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL.

737
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
>> YOU JOINED A COALITION OF

738
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
MAYORS WHO HAVE CALLED FOR MORE

739
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
ACTION.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID IT'S TIME

740
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
ON FRIDAY FOR MEANINGFUL ACTION.

741
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
WHAT SPECIFICALLY WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SEE?

742
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THAT AS

743
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
SOON AS WE GET THROUGH THIS

744
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
PROCESS OF TRYING TO GET OUR

745
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
OR HELP OUR COMMUNITY, HAVE HAVE

746
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
MAYOR BLOOMBERG AND OUR

747
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
CONFERENCE CHAIR FROM

748
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
PHILADELPHIA, MAYOR NUTTER, COME

749
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
TOGETHER.

750
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I MEAN WE ARE -- WE'RE THE

751
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
CLOSEST.

752
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
THE TOWNS AND CITIES ARE THE

753
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
CLOSEST TO HAVING DEAL WITH THE

754
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
EFFECTS OF THIS VIOLENCE, SO IT

755
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
SHOULD BE INCUMBENT UPON US TO

756
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
SOLIDIFY OURSELVES, TO BE A PORE

757
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
POWERFUL VOICE, TO BE MORE POWER

758
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN TO COME

759
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
TOGETHER WITH A BAN ON

760
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS TO MAKE SURE WE

761
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
PUT THE PRESSURE ON AND REALLY

762
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
MEET THE CHALLENGE OF HOW DO YOU

763
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
BALANCE -- WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR

764
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
IS SOME BALANCE.
WE DO RECOGNIZE OUR

765
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BEAR

766
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
ARMS, BUT I THINK THAT THIS HAS

767
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
GONE TO A POINT NOW TO AFFORD
SOME PEOPLE WITH THE ABILITY OF

768
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
CONDUCTING THESE MASS

769
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
EXTERMINATIONS IS JUST NOT

770
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
WHAT --

771
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
>> THIS HAS STRUCK HOME FOR YOU
PERSONALLY.

772
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
YOUR FATHER AND TWO FRIENDS, THE

773
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE.

774
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
>> MY FATHER WAS KILLED WHEN I
WAS A YEAR OLD.

775
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I NEVER GOT TO MEET HIM.

776
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I NEVER GOT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS

777
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
TO HAVE A FATHER, SO THIS HITS

778
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
VERY CLOSE, AND I ENDED UP IN

779
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
CONNECTICUT WHERE I LIVED IN THE

780
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
SOUTH BRONX WHERE MY TWO CLOSEST

781
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
FRIENDS WERE KILLED AS CHILDREN

782
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
THROUGH GUNS.
I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT IT AND

783
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
EMOTIONALLY VESTED, BUT I

784
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
RECOGNIZE IT'LL HAVE TO TAKE A
GROUP OF VERY DEDICATED PEOPLE

785
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
TO WORKING TOGETHER BECAUSE WE

786
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
DO NEED TO TAP DIFFERENT SOCIAL

787
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
SYSTEMS.

788
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I WORKED AS A PSYCHOTHERAPIST.

789
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
WHEN YOU GET PEOPLE THAT ARE

790
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
DISTRAUGHT INTO A CLINICAL

791
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
STUDY, IT DOESN'T TAKE VERY LONG

792
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
TO FIND OUT THAT THERE IS A

793
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
PROBLEM.
THE ISSUE BECOMES HOW DO WE

794
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
REACH OUT IN A WAY THAT

795
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
ELIMINATES THE POTENTIAL FOR

796
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
THESE FOLKS TO TO DO THIS DAMAGE
BY HAVING A WIDER NET.

797
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
>> MAYOR SEGARRA AND PIERRE

798
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
THOMAS, THANKS VERY MUCH.
>>> MUCH MORE OF OUR SPECIAL

799
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
EDITION OF "THIS WEEK" AHEAD.

800
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
OUR ROUNDTABLE JOINS US NEXT.

801
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
>>> THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE OUR

802
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THESE

803
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
CHILDREN ARE OUR CHILDREN.

804
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME

805
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
TOGETHER AND TAKE

806
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
MEANINGFUL ANGST TO PREVENT

807
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS REGARDLESS

808
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
OF THE POLITICS.

809
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
>> IT'S NOT RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT

810
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
THIS YESTERDAY.

811
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A YEAR AGO.

812
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TWO YEARS
AGO.

813
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THREE YEARS

814
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
AGO.

815
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'M GOING TO TAKE HIM AT HIS

816
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
WORD THAT WE WILL TRY TO DO

817
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
SOMETHING TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE

818
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
IN THIS COUNTRY, AND I'M WILLING

819
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
TO WORK WITH HIM ON WHAT THAT

820
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
WILL BE.
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL

821
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
ABOUT NEW -- SUGGESTING IT'S NEW

822
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
GUN LAWS.

823
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I MEAN THERE'S -- YOU KNOW, WE

824
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT DRIVES A
CRAZY PERSON TO DO THESE KINDS

825
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
OF ACTIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT

826
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
WE'RE ENFORCING THE LAWS THAT

827
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
ARE CURRENTLY ON THE BOOKS.

828
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
>> AND WE ARE BACK IN NEWTOWN,

829
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
CONNECTICUT, FOR OUR SPECIAL

830
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
EDITION OF "THIS WEEK."

831
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I AM JOINED ON OUR ROUNDTABLE BY

832
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
GEORGE WILL, DONNA BRAZILE, JOE

833
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
KLEIN OF "TIME" MAGAZINE AND

834
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
CONGRESSMAN JASON CHAFFETZ AND

835
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
CONGRESSWOMAN DONNA EDWARDS.

836
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
INTO FRIDAY AND SATURDAY, THERE
IS A DEPRESSING SAMENESS TO THE

837
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
CONVERSATION COMING OUT OF EACH

838
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
TRAGEDY.

839
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
>> YES, AND OUR RESPONSE IS

840
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
ALWAYS TO THINK IS THERE SOME

841
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
DEFECT IN THE SOCIAL SYSTEM OR

842
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
SOME PROMPTING IN THE SOCIAL

843
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
ATMOSPHERE THAT CAUSES THIS AND,

844
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
THEREFORE, WE ASSUME WE CAN

845
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
TAILOR A LAW TO CORRECT THE

846
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
DEFECT.

847
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
THE PROBLEM IS, THE LAW CAN DO

848
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
THREE THINGS.
IT CAN DETER WITH SEVERE

849
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
PUNISHMENTS.

850
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
OF COURSE, WE ALREADY HAVE

851
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
LOTS OF DETERRENTS AGAINST

852
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
MURDER AND IMPEDE THE ACCESSES

853
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
TO PUBLIC SPACES OR TO WEAPONS

854
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
OR, THIRD, THE LAW CAN MONITOR

855
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
AND IN SOME CASES CONFINE PEOPLE

856
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
WHO MEET THE PROFILE OF THESE

857
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
PEOPLE.

858
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THESE

859
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
PEOPLE ARE DETERMINED, PSYCHOTIC

860
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
AND OFTEN SUICIDAL.

861
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DETER

862
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
SOMEONE LIKE THAT OR IMPEDE, AND

863
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
THEN WHEN YOU COME TO THE
QUESTION OF MONITORING

864
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
CONFINING, YOU LOOK AT THE

865
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
PROFILE.

866
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
THESE ARE OFTEN MEN, YOUNG MEN,

867
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
YOUNG UNMARRIED MEN, YOUNG MEN

868
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
WHO ARE SOCIALLY AWKWARD AND

869
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
SOMETIMES YOUNG UNMARRIED

870
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
SOCIALLY AWKWARD MEN HAVE BEEN

871
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
DIAGNOSED OR EVEN PRESCRIBED

872
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
SOME KIND OF PSYCHOTROPIC

873
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
MEDICINE.

874
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
THE CIVIL LIBERTIES AND PRIVACY

875
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
ISSUES INVOLVED IN TRYING TO

876
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
MONITOR PEOPLE AND THIS NOT

877
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
INSIGNIFICANT COHORT WHO FIT

878
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
THAT PROFILE ARE INSEPARABLE.

879
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
>> YOU LAID SO MUCH ON THE
TABLE.

880
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
YOU ARE NODDING YOUR HEAD TO

881
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
PARTS OF IT.

882
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
>> ANGRY, ALIENATED,

883
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
DISCONNECTED FROM SOCIETY AT A

884
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
TIME WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

885
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
BUDGET CUTS.

886
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
TWO-THIRDS OF STATES HAVE CUT

887
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
SERVICES TO MENTAL HEALTH
AGENCIES.

888
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
$1,300 IS THE POLICY OF TREATING
ONE WITH MENTAL HEALTH

889
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
DISORDERS.

890
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
17,000 IS WHAT WE END UP PAYING

891
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
WHEN WE HAVE NO BEDS, AND

892
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
MEDICARE CANNOT FILL THE GAP.

893
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
GUN SAFETY LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY

894
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
ARE BROKEN, AND I WOULD HOPE

895
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WOULD LIKE

896
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
AT COMMONSENSE STEPS THAT WE CAN

897
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
TAKE TO AT LEAST FIX THE
BACKGROUND OR AT LEAST KNOW WHEN

898
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
PEOPLE ARE BUYING GUNS, WHO THEY

899
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
ARE AND IF THEY HAVE A RECORD.

900
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
>> I WANT TO GO TO THE MEMBERS

901
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
IN JUST A MOMENT,

902
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
BUT, JOE, LET ME BRING IT TO

903
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
YOU.

904
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS YOU'LL

905
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
HEAR IN THIS CASE IS THAT THE

906
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
BACKGROUND CHECK WASN'T EVEN

907
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
TRIPPED BECAUSE ALL THE GUNS
WERE IN THE HOME.

908
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
>> RIGHT, I MEAN I THINK THERE

909
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
ARE THINGS YOU -- THERE ARE

910
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
THINGS YOU COULD DO THAT WILL

911
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
LIMIT THESE INCIDENTS, NOTHING

912
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
THAT YOU CAN DO THAT WILL

913
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
TOTALLY ELIMINATE THEM.

914
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
THE STRIKING PIECE OF NEWS TO ME

915
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
TODAY WAS THAT THE MOTHER WAS

916
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
VERY ANGRY AT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM

917
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
FOR NOT GIVING HER THE SUPPORT

918
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
SHE NEEDED TO DEAL WITH HER SON.

919
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
RIGHT NOW ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY

920
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
THERE ARE PARENTS OF YOUNG MEN

921
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
WITH SEVERE PSYCHOLOGICAL

922
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
PROBLEMS WHO ARE SCARED TO DEATH

923
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THAT THEIR KIDS ARE GOING TO GO

924
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
AND DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS TOO,

925
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
AND IN MANY CASES AFTER THEY

926
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
PASS THE AGE OF 18, THESE

927
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
PARENTS MAY WANT THE CHILDREN TO

928
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
BE IN, YOU KNOW, IN SOME KIND OF

929
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
A RESIDENTIAL SETTING, BUT THEY

930
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
DON'T HAVE THE POWER, THE LEGAL

931
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
POWER TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

932
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
WITH IT.

933
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
WE GOT RID OF MENTAL HOSPITALS

934
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
IN THIS COUNTRY 50 YEARS AGO,

935
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
AND THAT WAS A GOOD THING.

936
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

937
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
REPLACED BY MEDICATION AND BY

938
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS LIKE

939
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
HALFWAY HOUSES, BUT NOBODY

940
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
WANTED TO HAVE HALFWAY HOUSES IN

941
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.

942
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
SO WE HAVE ABDICATED OUR

943
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
RESPONSIBILITY TO THE MENTALLY

944
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
ILL IN THIS COUNTRY AND TO THE

945
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
PARENTS OF THE MENTALLY ILL WHO

946
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
ARE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW.

947
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
>> GOVERNOR, WHAT IS THE

948
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY?

949
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
>> I WISH THERE WAS ONE THING WE

950
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
COULD DO TO MAKE SURE IT NEVER

951
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
EVER HAPPENS AGAIN AND GOD BLESS

952
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
THOSE FAMILIES DEALING WITH A

953
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
SITUATION.
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE BUT WE HAVE

954
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
TO DEAL WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH

955
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
ASPECT AND I THINK IT'S FAIR

956
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
GAME, AND WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT

957
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
THE INTERSECTION OF A LETHAL

958
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
WEAPON AS IT RELATES TO MENTAL

959
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
HEALTH.

960
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT

961
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
DISCUSSION IN THIS COUNTRY AND

962
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
ALSO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE NEW

963
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
SOCIAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THE

964
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
BOMBARDMENT AND THE IMMEDIACY OF

965
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
SOCIAL INTERACTION BETWEEN
VIOLENCE, THE REALISM YOU FIND

966
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
IN GAMES AND MOVIES.

967
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
SOME PEOPLE, THE YOUNG PEOPLE AS

968
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
THEY'RE MAKING THIS TRANSITION

969
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
FROM THEIR TEEN YEARS INTO

970
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
ADULTHOOD AREN'T ABLE TO

971
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
MENTALLY MAKE THAT TRANSITION

972
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
AND THERE DOES NEED TO BE HELP

973
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
BUT WE'LL ALSO NEED TO LOOK TO
FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES AND

974
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
CHURCHES.

975
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
IT'S NOT JUST A GOVERNMENT

976
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
SOLUTION.

977
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
>> BASED ON WHAT YOU SAID, THERE

978
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
HAVE BEEN SOME REPORTS,
CONGRESSWOMAN EDWARDS, THIS

979
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
YOUNG MAN, WAS HE PLAYING A LOT

980
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
OF THOSE VIOLENT VERY REALISTIC

981
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
GAMES?

982
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE ARE

983
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
MULTIPLE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO

984
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
HERE AND USE THIS CIRCUMSTANCE,

985
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
THE TRAGEDY IN NEWTOWN TO CREATE

986
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
BOTH POLICY SOLUTIONS BUT ALSO

987
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
CULTURAL SOLUTIONS.

988
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I THINK THAT IT -- WELL, IT IS

989
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
TRUE.

990
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
WE HAVE TO REBUILD OR BUILD A

991
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
FABRIC FOR MENTAL HEALTH

992
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
SERVICES, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG

993
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
PEOPLE TO GIVE PARENTS THE

994
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED AND

995
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
WRAP OUR HANDS AROUND IT THAT

996
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
THIS COMMUNITY WILL NEED

997
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
AND SURVIVING FAMILIES AND

998
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
CHILDREN.

999
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
BUT WE ALSO -- WE'VE GOT TO GET

1000
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
THE GUNS.
I MEAN, WE JUST DO.

1001
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
THERE WERE ASSAULT WEAPONS USED

1002
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
HERE, WEAPONS THAT ARE USED BY

1003
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
MILITARY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT,

1004
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE

1005
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
CAN BE A BRIGHT LINE FOR

1006
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
REMOVING THOSE KINDS OF WEAPONS.
THERE CAN BE A BRIGHT LINE FOR

1007
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT DON'T

1008
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
JUST COVER 60% OF THE GUNS THAT

1009
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
COME THROUGH GUN SHOWS AND

1010
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
INDIVIDUAL SALES.

1011
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
WE REGULATE CARS IN THAT RESPECT

1012
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
KNOWING WHO TRANSFERS A CAR MORE

1013
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
THAN WE KNOW WHO TRANSFERS A

1014
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
WEAPON.

1015
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
THERE ARE REAL THINGS THAT WE

1016
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
CAN DO, AND WE HAVE AN

1017
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
OBLIGATION, AND IF THIS DOESN'T

1018
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
CALL US TO ACTION I DON'T KNOW

1019
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
WHAT WILL.

1020
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS

1021
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
WE WILL FIND AN ANSWER TOO

1022
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
SOON, I SUPPOSE.

1023
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
BUT, GEORGE, ON THAT, IT'S KIND

1024
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
OF STRIKING,

1025
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
YOU READ 24 HOURS AFTER THIS

1026
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
THAT A VERY SIMILAR INCIDENT

1027
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
HAPPENED IN CHINA.
A MAN IN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

1028
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
WITH A KNIFE, NOT AN ASSAULT

1029
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
WEAPON, ALMOST TWO DOZEN KIDS

1030
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
INJURED BUT NOT KILLED.

1031
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
>> IN 1996 A MAN WENT INTO A GYM

1032
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
CLASS IN SCOTLAND, KILLED 16

1033
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
5-YEAR-OLDS AND 6-YEAR-OLDS AND

1034
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
THE TEACHER.

1035
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
A FEW YEARS AGO IN NORWAY, A

1036
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
YOUNG, DERANGED, YOUNG MAN

1037
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
KILLED, WHAT, 69 PEOPLE ON AN

1038
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
ISLAND, MOSTLY TEENAGERS.

1039
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
CONNECTICUT HAS AMONG THE

1040
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THIS

1041
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
COUNTRY.
DIDN'T HELP.

1042
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
SCOTLAND AND NORWAY HAVE VERY

1043
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
TOUGH GUN LAWS, DIDN'T HELP.

1044
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
>> DIDN'T STOP BUT IT DOES

1045
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
LESSEN THE OCCASION OF VIOLENCE,

1046
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
DOESN'T IT?

1047
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
>> SINCE COLUMBINE THERE HAVE

1048
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
BEEN 181 OF THESE SCHOOL
SHOOTINGS.

1049
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
>> REMEMBER, WE DID HAVE A BAN

1050
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
ON ASSAULT WEAPONS.

1051
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
WHEN WE PUT THE BAN IN PLACE

1052
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
THESE INCIDENTS DIDN'T DECLINE
IN A MEASURABLE WAY.

1053
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
AND WHEN WE TOOK THEM OFF

1054
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
THEY DIDN'T INCREASE IN A

1055
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
MEASURABLE WAY.

1056
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
>> THERE WERE FIVE GUNS IN THE

1057
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
HOUSE.

1058
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
THE SHOOTER CHOSE TWO

1059
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC PISTOLS AND ONE
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE.

1060
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
HE DID NOT CHOOSE THE TWO DEER

1061
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
HUNTING RIFLES.

1062
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE

1063
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
CONGRESSWOMAN IS ABSOLUTELY

1064
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
RIGHT, THERE IS A BRIGHT LINE

1065
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
HERE THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO,

1066
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
YOU KNOW, HUNT.
YOU KNOW, HUNTERS SHOULD BE ABLE

1067
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
TO GO ABOUT THEIR SPORT, BUT

1068
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
THERE'S NO NEED TO HUNT WITH A

1069
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE.
THERE'S NONE.

1070
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
>> CONGRESSMAN?

1071
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
>> WELL, LOOK I'M A CONCEALED

1072
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
CARRY PERMIT GUN HOLDER.

1073
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I HAVE A GLOCK .23.

1074
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I'M NOT THE PERSON YOU NEED TO

1075
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
WORRY ABOUT AND THERE ARE

1076
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
MILLIONS WHO DEAL WITH THIS

1077
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
PROPERLY.

1078
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
IT'S THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT

1079
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
RIGHT TO DO SO.
BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

1080
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
MENTAL HEALTH ACCESS.

1081
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
>> IS THERE SUCH -- ANY KIND OF

1082
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
WEAPON, ANY CAPACITY --

1083
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
>> THERE ARE PROHIBITIONS -- GUN

1084
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
RULES ARE VERY STRINGENT.
THERE IS A LOT OF CONJECTURE OUT

1085
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
THERE THAT I DON'T THINK

1086
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
NECESSARILY WOULD SOLVE THIS

1087
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
PARTICULAR PROBLEM, AND I WANT

1088
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
TO LOOK AT ANYTHING THAT WE

1089
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
THINK WILL SOLVE ALL THE

1090
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
PROBLEMS, BUT WE HAVE TO, I

1091
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
THINK, LOOK AT THE MENTAL HEALTH

1092
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
ASPECT.

1093
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
>> WE DO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

1094
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
MENTAL HEALTH ASPECT, BUT THE

1095
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
COMPLEX PROBLEMS REQUIRE COMPLEX

1096
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
SOLUTIONS, AND IT ISN'T ONE
THING.

1097
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
IT'S ALL OF THESE THINGS, AND

1098
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
SOME PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO

1099
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
DEFLECT THE CONVERSATION ONLY TO

1100
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT

1101
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
ARE SEVERE

1102
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
AND THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH

1103
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
WITHOUT DEALING WITH THE REALITY

1104
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
WE HAVE, A LOT OF WEAPONS OUT

1105
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
THERE, AND PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO

1106
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
THEM, AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

1107
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
A WAY THAT WE CAN PROTECT OUR

1108
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
CHILDREN IN THEIR KINDERGARTEN

1109
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
AND FIRST GRADE CLASSROOMS.

1110
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
>> I WANT TO BRING THIS TO DONNA

1111
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
BRAZILE.

1112
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
AND AS I DO THIS, DONNA, THE

1113
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
POLITICS OF ALL THIS, GENERALLY

1114
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
SHOW -- I WANT TO SHOW THIS PEW

1115
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
SUPPORT, SUPPORT FOR GUN
CONTROL, GENERALLY DOESN'T GO UP

1116
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
AFTER MAJOR SHOOTINGS, AFTER

1117
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
AURORA AND GABBY GIFFORDS, IT

1118
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
WENT DOWN, AND VIRGINIA TECH

1119
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
WENT UP A LITTLE BACK IN 2007

1120
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
RELUCTANT TO TAKE THIS ON AND

1121
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
YOU SAW HIM SAY IT'S TIME FOR

1122
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
MEANINGFUL ACTION.

1123
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT AND DO YOU

1124
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
THINK NOW THAT THE PRESIDENT

1125
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
WON'T FACE ELECTION AGAIN, HE

1126
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
WILL ADDRESS THEM IN A DIFFERENT

1127
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
WAY?

1128
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
>> I HOPE SO BECAUSE THERE'S

1129
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
EXPECTATIONS I THINK NOT JUST

1130
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
FROM THE FAMILIES BUT OTHERS WHO

1131
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE PRESIDENT
TAKE SOME STEPS.

1132
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
HE'S TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE

1133
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
AFTER AURORA WHERE HE SAID WE

1134
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
NEED TIGHTER RESTRICTIONS ON

1135
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL

1136
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
DISABILITIES FOR HAVING GUNS AND
SPOKE AT THE NATIONAL URBAN

1137
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
LEAGUE ABOUT THIS, BUT THERE'S A

1138
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
TIME FOR THIS, AND HOPEFULLY

1139
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
IT'S SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

1140
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
YOU KNOW, I'M A -- AS A

1141
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
SOUTHERNER, I'M A BIG ADVOCATE

1142
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND GREW

1143
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
UP WITH GUNS AND GREW UP WITH

1144
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTOOD HOW TO USE

1145
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
THEM RESPONSIBLY.
I DID NOT GROW UP WITH PEOPLE

1146
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
WITH ASSAULT RIFLES OR

1147
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC GUNS.

1148
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAD NEED A

1149
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
CONVERSATION, A REAL

1150
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
DEEP CONVERSATION AND THIS

1151
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
SIMPLY CANNOT BE STOPPED SIMPLY
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF THE

1152
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
POLITICS.

1153
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
>> YOU ALSO GREW UP TO BE THE

1154
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
CAMPAIGN MANAGER OF AL GORE WHO

1155
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
LOST THE HOME STATE OF

1156
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
TENNESSEE, THE MYTH IS AT LEAST

1157
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
IN PART BECAUSE HE SUPPORTED GUN

1158
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
CONTROL.

1159
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
THIS IS A POLITICAL, NOT A
JURISPRUDENTIAL PROBLEM.

1160
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
THE SECOND PART, THE HILLER CASE

1161
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
CONCERNING AN ABSURDLY

1162
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
RESTRICTIVE D.C. LAW IS REALLY

1163
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
MUCH MORE PERMISSIVE THAN PEOPLE

1164
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
REALIZE, AND I'M NOT SURE THERE

1165
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
WOULD BE A SECOND AMENDMENT

1166
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
IMPEDIMENT TO BANNING A CATEGORY

1167
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
OF WEAPONS.

1168
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
THERE WOULD BE A POLITICAL ONE.

1169
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
>> 60,000 MURDERS SINCE
COLUMBINE.

1170
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
>> AND THE LARGE CAPACITY OF

1171
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
THESE WERE USED IN THESE WEAPONS

1172
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
THAT ALLOWED THIS PERPETRATOR TO

1173
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
GO INTO A SCHOOL AND EACH OF THE

1174
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
VICTIMS SUFFERING MULTIPLE
GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

1175
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
THIS IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE.

1176
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
>> THERE'S A -- YOU KNOW, I

1177
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
THINK THAT WE CAN'T THINK ABOUT

1178
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
THIS IN TERMS OF IRRADICATION.

1179
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
THESE INCIDENTS ARE ALWAYS GOING

1180
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
TO HAPPEN.

1181
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
>> REDUCTION.

1182
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
>> WE CAN THINK THE MENTAL

1183
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
HEALTH PIECE IS OBVIOUSLY

1184
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
IMPORTANT.

1185
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I THINK THERE IS A BRIGHT LINE

1186
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
ON GUN CONTROL, AS WELL BUT

1187
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
THERE'S A THIRD PIECE AND THAT

1188
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
IS THE CELEBRATION OF VIOLENCE.

1189
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
WE NOT ONLY HAVE A SECOND

1190
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
AMENDMENT IN THE COUNTRY,

1191
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
WE ALSO HAVE A

1192
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
FIRST AMENDMENT THAT PROTECTS,

1193
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
YOU KNOW, SYLVESTER STALLONE'S

1194
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
RIGHT TO FIRE THOUSANDS OF

1195
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
BULLETS IN ANY GIVEN MOVIE, BUT

1196
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT

1197
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN THIS

1198
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
SOCIETY IS TREAT PEOPLE WHO

1199
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
CREATE VIOLENT MOVIES AND

1200
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES WITH THE

1201
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
SAME DEGREE OF RESPECT THAT WE

1202
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
ACCORD PORNOGRAPHERS.

1203
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
THEY NEED TO BE SHUNNED.

1204
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
>> I NEED TO ADD TO THAT.

1205
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF RESPONSE
ON FACEBOOK ABOUT HOW ALL OF US

1206
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
COVERED THIS AND IN THE MEDIA

1207
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
AND THE WAY OF THESE SHOOTINGS.

1208

SCOTT LARARCHE "MEDIA

1209
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
SENSATIONALISM CONTRIBUTES MORE

1210
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
TO THIS THAN GUNS.

1211
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
IT'S ALWAYS THE PERSON WHO PULLS

1212
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
THE TRIGGER, NOT THE GUN THAT

1213
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
KILLS.
WE NEED TO STOP MAKING THESE

1214
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
KILLERS FAMOUS.

1215
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
>> BILL COTTON "STOP THE

1216
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
WALL-TO-WALL COVERAGE.

1217
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
WE TRIED TO TALK LESS ABOUT THE

1218
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
KILLER BUT, CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS

1219
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
SOMETHING, JOE BRINGS UP AND

1220
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
THOSE VIEWERS BRING UP, AS WELL,

1221
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
HOW DO WE TALK ABOUT THIS IN A

1222
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
WAY THAT DOESN'T ENCOURAGE THE

1223
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
CONTAGION?

1224
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT THE NEWS

1225
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
COVERAGE THAT I'VE SEEN IS

1226
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
GLAMORIZING THE KILLER AS MUCH

1227
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
AS ALLOWING THE REST OF THE

1228
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
COUNTRY TO GRIEVE.

1229
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
AS A PARENT WE ALL SHED A TEAR.

1230
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I DO AGREE WITH JOE THAT YOU PUT

1231
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
VIOLENCE AND DEATH AND GORE IN A

1232
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
MOVIE, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET

1233
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
AN "R" RATING.

1234
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
YOU DO SOMETHING ELSE, OKAY.

1235
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I GOT TO TELL YOU, I THINK THE

1236
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
MOVIE RATINGS ARE TERRIBLY

1237
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
MISLEADING WHEN IT COMES TO

1238
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
VIOLENCE, DEATH, GORE AND

1239
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
GLAMORIZING IT.

1240
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
>> ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE

1241
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A CULTURE

1242
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
THAT CELEBRATES VIOLENCE, BUT IT

1243
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
DOESN'T TAKE AWAY OUR

1244
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
RESPONSIBILITY, AND I WANT TO

1245
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
URGE AND CHALLENGE MY COLLEAGUES

1246
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
TO WORK WITH ME TO WORK WITH

1247
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
US ON THIS SO NO PARENT HAS TO

1248
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
EXPERIENCE WHAT THESE PARENTS

1249
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
AND FAMILIES DO IN NEWTOWN.

1250
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
THE BRIGHT LIFE BETWEEN THOSE

1251
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
WHO ARE HUNTERS AND SHOOTERS AND

1252
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
OUTDOORS PEOPLE, BUT THEY DON'T
NEED AN ASSAULT RIFLE.

1253
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
THEY DON'T NEED HIGH-CAPACITY

1254
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
MAGAZINES THAT CREATE HAVOC AND

1255
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
VICIOUSNESS AND DEATH AND WE CAN

1256
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
DO THAT.

1257
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS.

1258
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
WE CAN DO THAT.

1259
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
WE CAN CLOSE THAT UP, AND THEN

1260
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
WE ALLOW OURSELVES TO HAVE -- TO

1261
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
ENJOY THE SECOND AMENDMENT

1262
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
RIGHTS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT BUT

1263
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
ALSO WE RESPECT HUMAN LIFE.

1264
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
>> GEORGE, WHEN MY LITTLE

1265
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
NEPHEWS LEFT NEW ORLEANS AFTER

1266
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
KATRINA, I'LL NEVER FORGET WHAT

1267
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
THEY SAID.

1268
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
"AUNTIE, I DON'T HEAR GUNSHOTS

1269
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
AT NIGHT."

1270
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
TOO MANY OF OUR KIDS ARE

1271
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
LIVING WITH GUNS.

1272
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
THEY ARE LIVING WITH THE FEAR OF

1273
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
VIOLENCE.
THEY ARE DYING SOMETIMES IN

1274
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
THEIR HOMES, SOMETIMES WALKING
HOME FROM SCHOOLS AND WHILE THIS

1275
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
TRAGEDY IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE, YOU

1276
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

1277
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
TOO MANY OF OUR BABIES BEING
MURDERED EVERY DAY SENSELESS AND

1278
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO HAVE THIS

1279
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
CONVERSATION.

1280
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
>> WE'RE HAVING IT.

1281
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
>> THE QUESTION IS WHAT TO DO

1282
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
AND WHAT IS POSSIBLE TO DO.

1283
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
>> WELL, WE OUGHT TO BRING IN

1284
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL OF CHICAGO.

1285
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
CHICAGO IS IN AN EPIDEMIC OF

1286
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
VIOLENCE WITH YOUNG, LARGELY

1287
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
UNPARENTED, THAT IS, NO FATHER

1288
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
IN THE HOME, ADOLESCENT MALES.

1289
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
NOW, THAT'S A PROBLEM QUITE

1290
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
SEPARATE FROM THIS.

1291
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
ANOTHER THING THAT WE'RE GOING

1292
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
TO DO AND MAKES ONE'S HEART

1293
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
SINK, GEORGE, IS THIS,

1294
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
WE'RE GOINT TO RATCHET UP THE

1295
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
PUBLIC PLACES.

1296
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
THEY'RE ALREADY BLIGHTED BY
THIS.

1297
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
FOR GENERATIONS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

1298
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
USING THE WATER ON THE MALL TO

1299
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
RUN LITTLE SAILING BOATS.

1300
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
NOW THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS WISDOM
HAS BANNED REMOTE CONTROL LITTLE

1301
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
BOATS ON THE MALL WATER IN

1302
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
WASHINGTON BECAUSE IT SOMEHOW

1303
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
REPRESENTS A SECURITY THREAT TO

1304
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
THE COUNTRY.

1305
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
WE HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT

1306
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
REASONABLE, AND UNLESS WE

1307
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
SURROUND OUR CITIZENRY WITH THE

1308
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
QUITE FALSE IDEA THAT THIS IS AN

1309
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS --

1310
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
>> AND ON THAT POINT, JOE KLEIN,

1311
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
PEOPLE SHOULD BE REMINDED.

1312
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
PARENTS SHOULD BE REMINDED THAT

1313
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

1314
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
SCHOOLS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE

1315
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
SAFE.

1316
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1317
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW, I HAD THIS

1318
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
CREEPY FEELING WALKING INTO THIS

1319
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
SCHOOL THIS MORNING THAT I

1320
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
WASN'T IN A PLACE OF SAFETY IN

1321
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
THIS TOWN.

1322
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
>> EVEN THOUGHT THERE WAS NO

1323
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
RATIONAL --
>> IT WAS A COMPLETELY

1324
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
IRRATIONAL THOUGHT, AND WHEN I

1325
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
SAY THAT I THINK ABOUT ALL THE

1326
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
CHILDREN WHO ARE GOING TO BE

1327
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
WALKING INTO SCHOOLS TOMORROW.

1328
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
>> AND THAT GIVES US A PLACE WE

1329
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
HAVE TO STOP BECAUSE WE WANT TO

1330
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
TALK ABOUT THAT WITH DR. RICHARD

1331
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
BESSER WHEN WE COME BACK.

1332
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
>> THIS WAS NOT GOD'S PLAN.

1333
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
>> THIS WAS NOT GOD'S PLAN.

1334
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
THIS WAS A MAN WITH SERIOUS

1335
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
ISSUES IN HIS LIFE.

1336
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
WHY HE'D WANT TO DESTROY

1337
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
INNOCENT CHILDREN, NO ONE CAN
FIGURE OUT.

1338
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
>> WE'RE GRIEVING WITH YOU.
>> I APPRECIATE IT.

1339
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I'M SO TIRED.

1340
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
IT'S JUST BRUTAL.

1341
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
SAME SO TIRED.

1342
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
IT'S JUST BRUTAL.

FROM NEWTOWN.

1379
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
>> THE SHE GAVE US AN EXAMPLE

1380
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
THAT SHE SHOWED US IS

1381
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
REMARKABLE.

1382
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON, AND

1383
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER DAD.

1384
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
But when I was in an accident...

1385
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I was worried the
health care system

1386
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
spoke a language all its own

1387
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
With UnitedHealthcare,
I got help that fit my life.

1388
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Information on my phone.

1389
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Connection to doctors who
get where I'm from.

1390
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And tools to estimate what
my care may cost.

1391
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So I never missed a beat.

1392
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
We're more than 78,000
people looking out for

1393
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000

1445
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I WAS -- I'M A MOTHER OF THREE

1446
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
CHILDREN, AND I WAS A ROOM

1447
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000

00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
MEETINGS YESTERDAY WITH THE

1452
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
WONDERFUL FIRST SELECT WOMAN,

1453
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
ALSO A MOTHER HERSELF, PAT

1454
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
LLODRA, THERE IS A LOT OF FOCUS

1455
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
ON WHAT THE DOCTOR WAS REFERRING

1456
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
TO, SUPPORTING AND KEEPING THESE

1457
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
CHILDREN TOGETHER, KEEPING THEM

1458
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
WITH THEIR TEACHERS, ALLOWING

1459
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
THIS COMMUNITY TO GRIEVE

1460
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
TOGETHER.

1461
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
THE DEPTH OF THEIR GRIEF IS A

1462
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
REFLECTION OF THE DEPTH OF THE

1463
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
LOVE THIS COMMUNITY HAS.

1464
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
IT'S A VERY SPECIAL PLACE, AND I

1465
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE

1466
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
TO REALIZE THAT ABOUT NEWTOWN.

1467
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
>> AND BUT YOU MADE THIS POINT

1468
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
YESTERDAY, RICH, YOU HAVE TO

1469
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
ALSO BE CAREFUL WITH THESE KIDS

1470
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
THAT THEY DON'T SOMEHOW DEFINE

1471
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
THEMSELVES BY THIS TRAGEDY.

1472
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
>> THAT'S SO VERY IMPORTANT.

1473
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
THERE ARE PHASES, AND WE'RE SO

1474
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
EARLY IN THIS, BUT YOU DON'T

1475
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
WANT THESE CHILDREN TO BECOME

1476
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
TRAGEDY CELEBRITIES.

1477
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE AS THEY

1478
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
GREW UP WHAT THEY'RE KNOWN FOR.

1479
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
THEY NEED TO BE KNOWN FOR HOW

1480
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
THEY PLAY SOCCER OR HOW THEY

1481
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
STUDY IN CLASS OR WHAT THEY DID

1482
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
FOR SOMEONE IN THEIR COMMUNITY.

1483
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, THIS

1484
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
CAN BE THE DEFINING THING IN

1485
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
THEIR LIFE.

1486
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
>> AND, FATHER, SO OFTEN

1487
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
FORGOTTEN, THE TOLL THIS TAKES

1488
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
ON THOSE WHO COME TO SAVE, THOSE

1489
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
WHO COME TO HELP,

1490
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS,

1491
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
AND THAT IS YOUR JOB TO COUNSEL

1492
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
THEM.

1493
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
>> EXACTLY, THE FIRST

1494
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
RESPONDERS ARE MEMBERS OF PUBLIC

1495
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
SAFETY.
THEY DO TREMENDOUS WORK FOR US

1496
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
AND YET THEY'RE A PARENT AS

1497
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
WELL, THEY HAVE CHILDREN.

1498
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
THEY'RE SEEING THIS AND MOST OF

1499
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
THE TIME THEY'RE RESPONDING TO

1500
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY OF PEOPLE WHO
MAY BE LIFELONG CRIMINALS.

1501
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
NOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THE

1502
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
INNOCENCE OF A COMMUNITY OF ITS

1503
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
CHILDREN, OF ITS FUTURE.

1504
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
AND SO AS A RESULT, THEY'RE

1505
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
RESPONDING TO PEOPLE THAT THEY

1506
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
KNOW, PEOPLE THAT THEY LIVE IN

1507
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
THE COMMUNITY WITH, THAT THEY

1508
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
SHARE WITH.
>> I WOULD IMAGINE ALSO

1509
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
THAT'S -- THEY RESPOND TO THE

1510
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
INNOCENCE BUT THEY HAVE TO

1511
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
CONFRONT THOSE WHO PERPETRATE

1512
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
THESE CRIMES.
>> EXACTLY.

1513
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
>> THEY MUST BE DEALING WITH SO

1514
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
MUCH ANGER.

1515
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,000
>> IT CAN BE, AND THAT'S A REAL

1516
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
EMOTION, AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT

1517
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
TO BE AROUND SO THEY CAN HAVE A

1518
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
SAFE ENVIRONMENT WHERE WHEN THAT

1519
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
ANGER BUILDS UP, THEY CAN

1520
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
EXPRESS IT SO IT DOESN'T TAKE

1521
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
OVER THEM.
THE ANGER CANNOT BE AN IMPETUS

1522
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
FOR HOW THEY ACT BUT RATHER A

1523
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
RESULT OF WHAT THEY'VE SEEN AND

1524
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
WHAT THEY'VE HAD TO DO.

1525
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
>> CONGRESSWOMAN, WHAT MORE WILL

1526
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
YOU BE LOOKING TO DO IN THIS
COMMUNITY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL

1527
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
DAYS AND WEEKS?

1528
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
>> WELL, TO BE SUPPORT -- TO

1529
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES WE CAN

1530
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
BRING TO BEAR WORKING WITH THE

1531
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
GOVERNOR, THE LOCAL COMMUNITY.

1532
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
THERE'S BEEN AN OUTPOURING OF

1533
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
SUPPORT FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY

1534
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
FOR TRAINED PROFESSIONALS TO

1535
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
HELP.

1536
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
IT NEEDS TO BE ON FOCUSED ON

1537
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
NEWTOWN, AND THE FATHER IS

1538
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
THE FIRST RESPONDERS TOO ARE

1539
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
TRAUMATIZED.

1540
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
YOU KNOW, THEY ARE PARENTS.

1541
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
THESE ARE THEIR LOVED ONES,

1542
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
THEIR CHERISHED ONES, SO I WANT

1543
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE KEEPING THEM

1544
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
AS PART OF THIS PROCESS, AND

1545
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
WHEN I TAKE OFFICE NEXT MONTH,

1546
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
TRULY THERE'S GOING TO BE MUCH

1547
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
MORE WORK TO BE DONE TO MAKE

1548
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
SURE THEIR JOBS AREN'T DONE IN

1549
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
VAIN AND DO SOMETHING AS A

1550
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
COUNTRY, RESPOND IN A WAY THAT

1551
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
ACKNOWLEDGES THIS IS

1552
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
UNACCEPTABLE, BUT RIGHT NOW IT

1553
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
IS THE FOCUS ON CHERISHING THE

1554
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
FAMILY.

1555
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
>> WE HAVE ONLY 30 SECONDS LEFT,

1556
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
RICH, ON THIS POINT OF MENTAL
HEALTH AND IDENTIFYING THOSE WHO

1557
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
MIGHT BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO A

1558
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
PROBLEM, WHAT IS THE SINGLE MOST
IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO?

1559
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
>> WELL, I THINK ACCESS TO CARE.

1560
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE WHO

1561
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
EITHER DON'T HAVE HEALTH

1562
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
INSURANCE OR THEIR PLANS DON'T

1563
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
COVER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OR

1564
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
ONLY COVER IT WHILE THEY'RE A

1565
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
CHILD.
YOU NEED TO BRIDGE THAT SO THAT

1566
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
IF YOU IDENTIFY SOMEONE, THERE'S

1567
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
SOMEWHERE YOU CAN SEND THEM SO

1568
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
THAT THEY'RE GETTING CARE.

1569
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
>> RICHARD BESSER, CONGRESSMAN
