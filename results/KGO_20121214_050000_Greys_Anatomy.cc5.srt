1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
IS THE BEST WAY
I CAN THINK OF

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
TO RUIN A PERFECTLY GOOD
MAI TAI.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
OH, ARE YOU GOING
SOMEPLACE WARM?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
WE DON'T
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
OH, NO. I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT MY HONEYMOON--

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
THE HOTEL, THE SIGHTS...

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'M GONNA HANDLE
MRS. GELLMAN MYSELF.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
WHAT I'M WEARING ON THE PLANE,
WHAT I'M WEARING ON THE BEACH.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
LEAH, LEAVE.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
AND THE WEDDING--SHOULD I
GET MY NAILS DONE TODAY

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
OR TOMORROW ON MY WAY
TO THE CEREMONY?

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
OKAY, SHE'S GONE.
I GOT THIS.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
(ding)

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
(Meredith) THE ADRENAL SYSTEM
REACTS TO STRESS

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
BY RELEASING HORMONES THAT
MAKES US ALERT AND REACTIVE.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
THE PROBLEM IS,

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
THE ADRENAL SYSTEM CAN'T TELL
WHAT'S A REGULAR CASE OF NERVES

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
AND WHAT'S
A REAL IMPENDING DISASTER.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
YO, LEFKOWITZ.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
DID YOU BRING IT?

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
(man) THAT'S THE WHOLE THING?
YEP.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
LEFKOWITZ HAS GASTROPARESIS

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
SO HE CAN'T DIGEST HIS FOOD.

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
HE WAS AN EPIC PUKER
FOR A LONG TIME,

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
AND NOW HE CAN'T REALLY
EAT AT ALL.

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
SO WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU
A GASTRIC NEUROSTIMULATOR.
(groans)

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
THIS THING,
IT'S GONNA ZAP YOUR STOMACH

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
SO IT REMEMBERS

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
TO PUSH THE FOOD
DOWN YOUR SYSTEM.

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
GET YOU BACK
ON BURGERS AND FRIES.

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
THAT'S AMAZING.

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
YEAH, WELL, THE GUYS

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
AT THE AIRPORT X-RAY
ARE GONNA GO NUTS.

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
THAT'S SICK.

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
OH, UH, THIS IS DR. WILSON.

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
SHE'S GONNA BE OPERATING
WITH ME.

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
YOU'VE GOT A-A CRACK TEAM,
IRON MAN.

WHEN YOU AND ARIZONA
GET TO THE WEDDING TOMORROW...

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
MM-HMM.
DON'T SIT DOWN.

49

WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
DON'T SIT DOWN?

50
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
JUST FIND A PLACE
AND STAND THERE.

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
YOU WANT US TO STAND
IN THE BACK?

52
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
THEN WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO HEAR ANYTHING.

53
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
STAND IN THE DAMN FRONT.

54
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
AND BLOCK EVERYBODY'S VIEW?

55
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
(sighs)
I MEAN, IF WE'RE--
I DON'T--

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
JUST PICK A SPOT.

57
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT COMPLICATED. UGH!

58
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ALLOW YOU
TO OPEN THEM UP WITH A KNIFE.

59
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
IF THEY KNEW YOU COULDN'T
FOLLOW A SIMPLE INSTRUCTION,

60
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
THEY WOULD RUN LIKE THE WIND
FROM THIS PLACE. (exhales)
(elevator bell dings)

61
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
ARE YOU...

62
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY,
"WOULD YOU DO ME THE HONOR

63
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
OF BEING MY BRIDESMAIDS?"

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
DOES THE WHOLE THING
HAVE TO BE ABOUT YOU?

65
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
JUST PUT ON A DRESS
AND DON'T SIT DOWN.

66
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
AWW. WE'RE BRIDESMAIDS.

67
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
OH, DON'T EVEN---
(squeals)

68
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
JU--JU--SEE? UGH.

69
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
THIS IS WHAT
I WAS TRYING TO AVOID.
OHH.

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
NOW ONCE I REMOVE
THE SURAL NERVE FROM YOUR LEG,

71
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
DR. TORRES WILL GRAFT IT ON TO
DR. SHEPHERD'S MEDIAN NERVE.

72
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
YOU'LL LIKELY EXPERIENCE
SOME DISCOMFORT

73
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
IN YOUR LEG FOR A FEW WEEKS--

74
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
MONTHS. MONTHS.

75
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
AND WHEN HE SAYS "DISCOMFORT,"
IT'S GONNA HURT LIKE HELL.

76
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
WELL, YOU'RE A BAG
OF SUNSHINE, AREN'T YOU?

77
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
SIX MONTHS FROM NOW

78
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
THAT YOU CAN'T MOVE

79
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
AND THAT THE IBUPROFEN
HURTS YOUR STOMACH.

80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
HE MAKES ME SOUND LIKE
I'M A 90-YEAR-OLD MAN.

81
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT?

82
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
BECAUSE I'VE HEARD FOR DECADES
HOW I RUINED YOUR LIFE...

83
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
BECAUSE YOU DID.
AND THAT MOM DOESN'T LOVE YOU.

84
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT THIS.

85
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO SAY IS "THANK YOU, LIZZIE,

86
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
FOR CUTTING OFF A LEG
AND GIVING IT TO ME."

87
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
AH. HERE IT IS. THIS IS HOW
IT'S GONNA GO DOWN IN HISTORY.

88
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
IT IS A NERVE.
IT IS NOT THE ENTIRE LEG.

89
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
OKAY. LET'S FOCUS.
JACKSON.

90
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
UM, I THINK
DR. SHEPHERD'S RIGHT.

91
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
IF YOU'RE UNSURE, WE--
OH, COME ON.

92
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'M JUST WINDING HIM UP
BECAUSE IT IS SO EASY.

93
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
JUST GIVE ME THE FORM.
OKAY.

94
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
(clears throat)

95
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
NOW CAN I GO HANG OUT
WITH ZOLA IN DAY CARE?

96
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
OH, I'M SORRY.

97
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
THEY DON'T LET THE ADULTS
COME AND GO

98
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
BECAUSE IT'S HARDER
ON THE KIDS.

99
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I WILL BRING HER TO YOU LATER.

THEY'RE GONNA
SEND THEM OVER TOMORROW.

109
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
OH, I SIGNED A BUNCH OF STUFF
WITH THEM LAST WEEK.

110
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
UH, NOT THE PLANE CRASH.
THE DIVORCE.

111

OH.

112
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
THAT WAS FAST.

113
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I SAID WE WANTED
TO MOVE QUICKLY.

114
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
APPARENTLY.

115
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
IT'S ALL DONE.
YOU JUST HAVE TO SIGN.

116
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
(exhales)
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

117
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
NOPE.

118

YOU KNOW, UM...

123
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
TELLING LIZZIE

124
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT.

125
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
(door closes)
UM, I THINK
IT'S STILL KIND OF EARLY.

126
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
YEAH, BUT SHE'S DOING
THIS THING FOR ME.

127
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
SHE'LL TELL
YOUR WHOLE ENTIRE FAMILY.

128
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
WELL, YOU TOLD CRISTINA.

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
HE'S BUILT A ROCKET SHIP
TO TRAVEL INTO SPACE."

348
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
GOOGLE, HOW FAR IS EARTH
TO THE MOON?

349
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
THE MOON IS 238,900 MILES...

350
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
"THE GREAT MOMENT HAD COME."

351
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
3, 2, 1...

352
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
[ GIGGLING ]

353
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
YOU WANNA SEE IF WALMART HAS
SIMILAR GIFTS FOR LESS?

354
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
YEAH.
LET'S GO.

355
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 --

356
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
OVER FIFTY DOLLARS LESS
THAN BEST BUY!

357
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
WOW! FIFTY BUCKS!

358
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
YEAH!

359
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
THAT'S A PAIR OF SHOES.

360
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
SEE FOR YOURSELF IF YOU COULD
SAVE ON THE GIFTS YOU WANT.

361
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
WALMART.

362
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
SEE FOR YOURSELF IF YOU COULD
SAVE ON THE GIFTS YOU WANT.

363
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I THINK YOU SHOULD BRING
A DATE TO DR. BAILEY'S WEDDING.

364
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
THAT WAY WE WILL
FOCUS ON OUR DATES

365
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
AND NOT ON EACH OTHER.

366
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
OR WE COULD JUST BE FOCUSED
ON THE HAPPY COUPLE.

367
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
(woman) THANK YOU.
I AM WEARING
A STRAPLESS DRESS.

368
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
FROM HERE UP,
I'M COMPLETELY NAKED.

369
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
JUST...
WEAR A DIFFERENT DRESS.

370
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I DON'T HAVE A DIFFERENT DRESS.

371
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I WORK LONG HOURS.
I DON'T SHOP.

372
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I HAVE--I HAVE
ONE DRESSY DRESS.

373
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FIND
A DATE WITH ONE DAY'S NOTICE?

374
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
(sighs)

375
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
(elevator bell dings)
STEPHANIE.

376
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
HEY.

377
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
UM, WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
TO DR. BAILEY'S WEDDING?

378
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
OH, WHAT?

379
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
DR. AVERY WOULD LOVE
FOR YOU TO GO WITH HIM.

380
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
HE THINKS THAT YOU'D BE
EMBARRASSED,

381
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
BUT YOU'RE NOT EMBARRASSED,
ARE YOU?
OF COURSE SHE'S EMBARRASSED.

382
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

383
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
LOOK, DON'T GET OTHER--
STRAPLESS...

384
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
AND TIGHT.

385
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
(indistinct conversations)

386
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I WILL PICK YOU UP
AT 1:00 TOMORROW

387
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

388
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
(elevator bell dings)

389
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

390
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

391
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
YOU GOT TO PICK MINE,
SO I GET TO PICK YOURS, RIGHT?

392
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
JACKSON.

393
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
OH.

394
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
WHAT ABOUT SHANE?

395
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
HE'S A GOOD-LOOKING
PIECE OF MAN, HUH?

396
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
THEY'RE THAT SHORT?

397
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
(Meredith) NO, THEY'RE
PERFECTLY RESPECTABLE CALVES.

398
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
(laughs)

399
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE NOT
GONNA GET QUITE ENOUGH NERVE

400
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
FROM JUST THE ONE.

401
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
(laughing) OKAY.

402
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I KNOW
IT'S A LOT TO ASK.

403
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
NO, IT'S, UH, FINE.
DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

404
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
DEREK THINKS
IT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK,

405
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
BUT HE REALLY NEEDS THIS,

406
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
SO IF HE COMES TO YOU AND TRIES
TO TALK YOU OUT OF IT,

407
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
YOU HAVE TO PUSH.

408
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
BUT DON'T TELL HIM THAT
I'M THE ONE THAT CAME TO YOU,

409
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
BECAUSE HE WON'T LIKE THAT.

410
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
(people speaking indistinctly)

411
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
YOU'VE GOT SOME BALLS,
DON'T YOU?

412
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
YOU KNOW, IF IT'S TOO MUCH,
WE CAN CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF.

413
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
YOU KNOW WE'RE FAMILY,
RIGHT?

414
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
THERE WAS NO WEDDING,
MEREDITH.

415
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
YOU ADOPTED A BABY

416
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
AND YOU NEVER INVITED US
TO COME MEET HER.

417
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
YOU NEVER ACCEPTED
OUR INVITATION TO COME SEE US.

418
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
ALL WE GOT WAS A COUPLE
OF PICTURES VIA E-MAIL.

419
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
YOU KNOW, MY KIDS WERE
SO EXCITED THAT FOR MONTHS,

420
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
THEY WALKED AROUND TELLING EVERY
AFRICAN-AMERICAN PERSON THEY SAW

421
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
THAT WE HAVE A BROWN BABY
IN THE FAMILY? (chuckles)

422
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
A YEAR LATER, THEY KIND OF THINK
I MADE THE WHOLE THING UP.

423
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,

424
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON--

425
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
NO, I GET THAT WE'RE ALL BUSY,

426
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
BUT YOU'RE NOT SHY ABOUT ASKING
ME FOR A COUPLE OF BODY PARTS,

427
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
AND NOW YOU WANT ME TO COVER
YOUR TRACKS WITH DEREK?

428
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
IF YOU FEEL LIKE
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE, WE--

429
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
NO, IT'S WHAT SISTERS
ASK SISTERS TO DO.

430
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
WE COVER EACH OTHER'S ASSES.

431
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO BE
A SISTER,

432
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I AM DELIGHTED,
BUT THEN ACT LIKE ONE.

433
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
(chuckles)

434
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
MY VERSION OF FAMILY
ISN'T LIKE YOUR VERSION.

435
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
YOU GUYS GIVE EACH OTHER CRAP
AND THEN YOU LAUGH ABOUT IT.

436
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
YOU'D WALK THROUGH FIRE
FOR EACH OTHER.

437
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
GREYS ARE NOT LIKE THAT.

438
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
DEREK SAID YOU HAD A SISTER
WHO WORKED HERE.

439
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
HALF.

440
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
SHE WAS ON THE PLANE?

441
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
YOU KNOW, I-I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY SISTER.

442
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
MY HUSBAND REALLY NEEDS THIS,
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE ME,

443
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
JUST--JUST HIM.

444
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
YOU HAVE A CHILD.

445
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
SHE'S PART OF MY FAMILY.

446
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD REALIZE,

447
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
YOU NEED SPARES IN A FAMILY.

448
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
YOU NEED
AS MANY AS YOU CAN GET.

449
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
IT WAS VERY NICE
TO TALK TO YOU, LIZZIE.

450
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
HEY.
(elevator bell dings)

451
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I STASHED A LITTLE JOHNNIE
IN CASE THE CEREMONY'S GOT

452
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
SOME COUSIN READING A POEM.

453
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
RIGHT.

454
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
UH, I MEANT TO FIND YOU.

455
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'M KIND OF BRINGING
A DATE.

456
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
YEAH, ME.

457
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
TWO GUYS PICKING UP
BRIDESMAIDS FROM OUT OF TOWN.

458
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
APRIL'S CONVINCED THAT IF WE
DON'T BOTH BRING DATES,

459
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
THEN WE'RE BOTH GONNA
END UP...

460
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
WHY YOU GOTTA TALK
TO HER?

461
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
SHE RUINS EVERYTHING.

462
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
HOW ABOUT I FIND SOMEONE
FOR YOU TO GO WITH?

463
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
YOU KNOW, MAYBE STEPHANIE
HAS A FRIEND.

464
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
STEPHANIE?
THAT'S WHO YOU'RE TAKING?
(bell dings)

465
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
YOU WANT A DATE OR NOT?
(doors open)

466
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
NO.

467
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
ALL RIGHT.

468
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
(indistinct conversations)

469
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
OKAY. WHATEVER.

470
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
JUST DON'T GET ME
AN UGLY ONE.

471
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
(indistinct conversations
continue)

472
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
WE'RE NOT DOING
THE PROCEDURE.

473
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
(scoffs)
OF COURSE WE'RE DOING IT.

474
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN I SAID I'D DO THIS?

475
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
MOM CALLED ME THREE TIMES
IN ONE DAY.

476
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
(imitates voice breaking) IT
JUST BRINGS TEARS TO MY EYES.

477
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
SHE'S A MESS.
(normal voice) COME ON.
YOU'RE THE GOLDEN CHILD.

478
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
THE REST OF US ARE JUST
SCRAPPING FOR SECOND POSITION,

479
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
AND I JUST PUT
A LOCK ON IT FOR LIFE.

480
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
YOU THINK I'M GIVING THAT UP

481
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
JUST 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO CUT
INTO TWO LEGS INSTEAD OF ONE?

482
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
LIZZIE--

483
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
NO, WE'RE NOT DISCUSSING IT.
I'VE DECIDED.

484
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
GET BACK ON THE HORSE,
DEREK.

485
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
OH, OKAY. SO YOU THINK I'M
USING THIS AS AN EXCUSE,

486
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
THAT I'M TOO SCARED TO TRY
AND OPERATE AGAIN?

487
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
NOTHING SCARES YOU.

488
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
MM.

489
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK?

490
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
HMM? WHAT IF WE
GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS

491
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
AND NOTHING COMES OF IT?

492
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
WELL, THEN
AT LEAST WE TRIED.

493
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
WE'RE DOING IT.

494
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
JUST... SAY THANK YOU.

495
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
YOU READY?

496
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
YEP.

497
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
BOVIE, PLEASE.
(exhales)

498
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
THANK YOU.

499
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
OKAY, HERE?

500
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
YEP.

501
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
TAKE YOUR TIME.

502
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
OKAY.
(sizzling)

503
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
WATCH OUT
FOR THE BLOOD VESSELS.

504
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
WOW. LOOK AT YOU,
ALL GROWN-UP.

505
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
UP IN THE SKILLS LAB,
I WAS DOING--

506
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
(monitor beeping erratically)

507
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
YOU PUT A HOLE
IN HIS STOMACH.

508
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I HAVEN'T EVEN--
MOVE, NOW. MOVE.

509
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
ALL RIGHT. CLAMP.

510
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
(woman) HERE YOU GO.
2.0 VICRYL.

511
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
(woman) I'LL GET IT.
SUCTION.

512
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

513
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
HEY, STEPH.

514
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
YOU OKAY THERE?

515
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
FINE.
TERRIFIC.

516
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I WANTED TO ASK YOU--

IF WE'RE IN A NASTY DIVORCE,
I'LL SAY,

863
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
"I KNEW IT WAS A MISTAKE
THE DAY WE GOT MARRIED."

864
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
YOU THINK IT'S A MISTAKE?

865
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I JUST FEEL...

866
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
WORRIED.

867
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I NEVER FELT THAT WAY
WITH TUCKER.

868
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
YOU WERE A CHILD
WHEN YOU MARRIED TUCKER.

869
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
YOU'RE AN ADULT NOW.

870
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
YOU KNOW THE WORLD'S
AN AMBIGUOUS PLACE.

871
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
YOU KNOW THAT LOVE
DOESN'T CONQUER ALL.

872
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
IT CONQUERS SOME STUFF.

873
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
THE OTHER STUFF KICKS
THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF LOVE.

874
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
AND THIS IS THE PEP TALK?

875
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
(chuckles)

876
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
OVERWHELMING DOUBT
IS A PROBLEM.

877
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
A LITTLE BIT OF DOUBT

878
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
IS JUST A SIGN
OF AN INTELLIGENT ADULT.

879
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
IS GREY GONNA BE
IN THE GALLERY?

880
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
NO. SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO MAKE YOU NERVOUS.

881
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
(Callie chuckles)

882
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I TOLD HER
YOU DON'T GET NERVOUS.

883
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T.

884
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

885
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
ENJOY YOUR NAP.

886
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.
MM.

887
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

888
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
TORRES.

889
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
HMM?

890
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

891
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
(laughs)

892
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
(hisses)

893
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000

894
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000

895
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
WE GOOD TO GO?

896
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
YES, WE ARE.

897
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
YES. WE'RE--YES.

898
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
(Meredith) Jackson,
I just want to let you know,

899
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'll be here watching
the whole time.

900
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

901
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
No mistakes.

902
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
THAT'S THE PLAN.

903
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
OKAY.

904
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
(clattering)

905
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Are you kidding me?

906
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
GET THAT WOMAN
OUT OF MY GALLERY.

907
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.
GET HER OUT.

908
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I heard that, Avery. Edwards,
don't even think about it.

909
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
(beeping continues)

910
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
NOW.

911
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Edwards, you wouldn't dare.

912
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
You have years with me.

913
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I can be very difficult
to deal with.

914
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
15-BLADE, PLEASE.

915
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
(Alex) YOU NARCED ON ME
TO MY BOSS?

916
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I WORKED HARD TO GET HERE.

917
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I'M NOT GONNA LET MYSELF
GET FIRED BECAUSE--

918
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
NOBODY'S FIRING YOU.

919
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I WAS TRYING TO HELP YOU.

920
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I CLEARLY WASN'T READY
FOR IT.

921
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
WHY, BECAUSE I HAD TO
TAKE OVER?

922
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
LOOK, YOU CAN'T GO CRYING
TO MY DAMN BOSS

923
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
EVERY TIME YOU GET SCARED.

924
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
YOU CAN'T CRY AT ALL
WHEN YOU GET SCARED

925
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
BECAUSE IT'S SCARY IN THERE
ALL THE TIME.

926
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I JUST THOUGHT,
MAYBE AFTER I BLEW THE APPY,

927
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I'D BE A GOOD TARGET

928
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
IF YOU NEEDED TO PIN SOMETHING
ON SOMEONE.

929
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
IT'S PARANOID. I GET THAT.

930
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I DON'T ALWAYS TRUST PEOPLE
WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP ME.

931
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
YEAH, YEAH,
YOU'RE A BEATEN DOG

932
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
AND YOU BITE PEOPLE
WHO TRY TO FEED YOU.

933
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I DON'T GIVE A CRAP
ABOUT YOUR SAD STORY.

934
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
YOU WANT TO BE A SURGEON, YOU
NEED TO GET THE HELL OVER IT.

935
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
YOU BURNED A BRIDGE WITH ME.

936
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
HOW ABOUT YOU GROW UP
BEFORE YOU BURN A BRIDGE

937
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
WITH EVERY OTHER ATTENDING

938
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
WHO TRIES
TO TEACH YOU SOMETHING?

939
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
50 CENTIMETERS
OF PRIME NERVE.

940
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
GREAT.

941
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
ALL RIGHT.

942
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
FORCEPS, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

943
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
OKAY.

944
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
IS NO ONE MAKING SMALL TALK

945
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
BECAUSE THIS IS DEREK SHEPHERD
ON THE TABLE?

946
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
THIS IS INTRICATE WORK.

947
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
SMALL TALK
IS WHAT KEEPS US AWAKE.

948
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
WELL, UH...
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,

949
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I HELPED DR. KEPNER
EXTRACT A MALIGNANT MASS

950
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
FROM THE GLUTEAL AREA
OF A FEMALE PATIENT.

951
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

952
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
IT--IT WAS
AN IMPRESSIVELY SIZED MASS.

953
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
WHO'S GONNA TELL DR. SHEPHERD
THAT HE'LL NEVER OPERATE AGAIN

954
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
BECAUSE ROSS' IDEA OF GOSSIP IS,

955
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
HE SAW APRIL KEPNER
TAKE A LUMP OFF AN ASS?

956
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
(beeping continues)

957
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
(instruments clink)

958
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
BROOKS, SUCTION.

959
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
(suction gurgles)

960
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
ALL OF, NOT HALF OF IT.

961
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
SORRY.

962
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
(gurgling)

963
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
HE'S GOT A BUNCH
OF TATTOOS.

964
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
WONDER IF IT'S SOME SORT
OF A GANG THING.

965
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I HAD--
THE CHATTER ISN'T HELPING ME,

966
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
AND YOUR EXPERIENCE
WITH GANGLAND YOUTH

967
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
HAS LITTLE BEARING
ON HOW WE TREAT THIS PATIENT.

968
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
(gurgling continues)

969
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
(turns water off)

970
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
(pedal clanks)

971
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

972
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE AMICABLE.

973
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
WE'RE GETTING DIVORCED
BECAUSE OF THE LAWSUIT?

974
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY
INCREASE YOUR CHANCES--

975
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO MENTION IT?

976
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I WANT YOU TO GET THE MONEY.

977
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I WANT ALL OF YOU
TO GET THE MONEY,

978
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
AND I KNEW THERE WAS
A VERY REAL CHANCE

979
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
THAT YOU WOULD REJECT THE IDEA

980
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
SIMPLY BECAUSE
I SUGGESTED IT.

981
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
OH, RIGHT. BECAUSE I'M
SO SIMPLE-MINDED AND PETULANT.

982
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
YOU'VE BEEN KNOWN TO--

983
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF

984
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
MAKING SOME KIND OF UNILATERAL
DECISION ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE?

985
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
HOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU
MOVED ACROSS THE COUNTRY

986
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
AND DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE
TO DO WHAT I DID

987
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
AND SIMPLY ASK
FOR A DIVORCE?

988
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
(laughs) OH, GOD.
SO THIS IS BALLSY,

989
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
YOU HIDING BEHIND
THE LAWSUIT?

990
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
YOU COULDN'T JUST
ADMIT TO ME,

991
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
OR--OR--OR GOD SAKE, YOURSELF,
THAT YOU WANTED OUT.

992
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
YOU HAVE TO LET
THIS STUPID PLANE CRASH

993
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
MAKE THE DECISION FOR YOU.

994
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I CHOSE THE AIRLINE!

995
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
YOU LIKE IT BETTER
WHEN I DECIDE?!

996
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I CHOSE THE AIRLINE!

997
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
(sighs)

998
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
WE HAD TO MAKE A BUDGET CUT
OF 4%...

999
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
AND WE HAD A LINE ITEM
OF EMERGENCY TRANSPORTATION.

1000
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
WE NEVER USED IT,
AND WE HAD A...

1001
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
FANCY CHARTER COMPANY,

1002
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
AND I CHOSE
A... CHEAPER ONE.

1003
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
IT WAS CHEAPER?

1004
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
YOU DIDN'T BUILD THE PLANE.

1005
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
PEOPLE ARE DEAD.

1006
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
OR FLY IT.

1007
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

1008
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE.

1009
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
(exhales)

1010
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
SOMEONE HAS TO BE.

1011
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I MEAN, IT TAKES
A LOT OF SMALL MISTAKES

1012
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
TO DESTROY SOMETHING,

1013
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
AND IT'S REALLY EASY
FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED

1014
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
JUST TO SAY, "AH, I JUST DID
THIS ONE SMALL THING."

1015
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
MADE IT POSSIBLE...

1016
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
FOR A BAD PLANE
TO TAKE OFF

1017
