NEWTOWN AND IT CAN HAPPEN

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
ANYWHERE, IN A SMALL RURAL

SANRY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
>> JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU CAN

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
BE COMPOSED AND KEEP IT

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
OUT THE NAMES AND AGES OF THE

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
VICTIMS AND EVEN NOT KNOWING

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
THEM, BUT JUST TO READ THROUGH

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
THEIR NAMES AND THEIR AGES IS

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
JUST WRETCHING.

WE'LL SHOW THEM LATER TO YOU,

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
BASICALLY 20 CHILDREN AND

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
YOUNGER THAN WE THOUGHT,

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
REMEMBER THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA
AND HIS FIRST REPORT THAT THEY

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
WERE BETWEEN FIVE AND TEN

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
YEARS OLD.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
THEY WERE REALLY JUST SIX AND

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
SEVEN YEARS OLD, ALL OF THEM

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
AND IT'S ALSO TO KNOW, WE

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME, WHAT

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
CLOSE RANGE THEY WERE KILLED.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
HOW GOOD OF A MARKSMAN THIS

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
SHOOTER WAS AND WE NOW KNOW

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
TRAGICALLY THEY WERE SHOT MANY

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
TIM

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
TIMES.
>> THE MOTHER OF THE SHOOTER,

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
NANCY, WAS A GUN COLLECTOR AND

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
TAUGHT HER SON HOW TO SHOOT

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
AND WE'LL BE ASKING QUESTIONS

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
ABOUT THIS IN THE DAYS AHEAD

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
AND ALL USED IN THE MASSACRE

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
WERE TIED, REGISTERED TO HER,

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
AND THE SHOOTER DID TRY TO BUY

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
HIS OWN RIFLE DAYS BEFORE THE

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
SHOOTING.

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
HE WAS DENIED.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
THE SCHOOLING OF THE SHOOTER

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
ALSO NOW WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT,

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
KELLY AND HE WAS APPARENTLY

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
SCHOOLED THROUGH THE SYSTEM

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
AND SOMEWHERE WITH PULLED OUT.

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
AND IT IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEWHERE

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
AROUND--

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
>> WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHY HE

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
WAS PULLED OUT OF SCHOOL AND

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
THAT'S UNDER INVESTIGATION AND

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
APPARENTLY HIS MOTHER THOUGHT

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
IT WAS BEST HE WAS HOME

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
SCHOOLED FOR A TIME AND IN

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
HIGH SCHOOL MANY DESCRIBED HIM

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
AS BEING VERY SMART,

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
BRILLIANT, BUT VERY MUCH TO

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
HIMSELF AND EVEN REPORTS THAT

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
HE ALWAYS CARRIED AROUND A

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
BRIEFCASE OR SOMETHING J.

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
>> YEAH, A BLACK BRIEFCASE.

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
>> STRANGE BEHAVIOR AND PEOPLE

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
WILL CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
THAT.
>> PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE A

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
GREAT AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE AND

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
PERHAPS THAT WILL LEAD TO SOME

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
CALL FOR THIS, THE BIG

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
QUESTION THAT WE HAVE IS WHY

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
AND THAT'S A QUESTION THAT

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
STILL REMAINS TO BE ANSWERED.

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
POLICE ARE HOPING THAT AS THEY

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
PIECE TOGETHER THE

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
INVESTIGATION--

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
>> PERHAPS BECAUSE THERE'S NO

119
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SHOOTER

120
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
AND THE SCHOOL.

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
>> NEVER ATTENDED THE SCHOOL.

122
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
>> Alisyn: I THOUGHT THERE

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
WERE SOME REPORTS AS A CHILD

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
HE DID.

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
>> HE DID NOT ATTEND SANDY

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY.

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
>> Alisyn: VERY INTERESTING.

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
>> AND THE MOM DID NOT WORK

129
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000

FOR THE 27-YEAR-OLD TEACHER

192
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000

196
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
TIME.

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
MY ONLY CHILD, BUT I COULDN'T

198
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
PICTURE THAT AND THAT'S WHY

199
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'M HERE TODAY.

200
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
BECAUSE SHE SAVED SO MANY

201
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
KIDS' LIVES.

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000

00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
ABOUT HER ULTIMATE FATE

207
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT AFTER

208
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED

209
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000

SHOT, THAT THEY THINK IT'S TOO

213
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
MUCH TO HANDLE AT THIS TIME.

214
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000

THEY WERE DOING KIDS STUFF.

223
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
IT'S THE KIND OF STUFF YOU'D

DAY, THERE WERE ABOUT A

237
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
HUNDRED CARS IN THE PARKING

238
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
LOT.

239
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
BACK TO YOU IN NEW YORK.

242
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
GIVEN ALL THE CRUSHING PAIN

243
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
FOR THAT COMMUNITY AND

244
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
EVERYONE, IT'S ALWAYS

245
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
ASTOUNDING WHEN A VICTIM'S

246
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
FAMILY MEMBER HUNG OUT AND

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
SPEAKS WITH AN OPEN HEART AND

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
SPEAKS WITH GENEROSITY ABOUT

249
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
THE SHOOTER AND THE SHOOTER'S

250
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
FAMILY AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

251
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
ROBERT PARKER DID.

252
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
HIS DAUGHTER WAS ONE OF THE

253
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
YOUNGEST VICTIMS AND HER NAME

254
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
WAS EMILIE PARKER, JUST SIX

255
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
YEARS OLD AND HE FOUND HIS WAY

256
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
THROUGH THE CROWD TO THE

257
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
MICROPHONE YESTERDAY AND HERE

258
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.

259
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, I'D REALLY

260
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
LIKE TO OFFER OUR DEEPEST

261
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
CONDOLENCES TO ALL THE

262
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
FAMILIES WHO ARE DIRECTLY

263
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
AFFECTED BY THIS SHOOTING.

264
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
IT'S A HORRIFIC TRAGEDY AND WE

265
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT

266
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
OUR HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO

267
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
OUT TO THEM.

268
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
THIS INCLUDES THE FAMILY OF

269
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
THE SHOOTER.

270
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD THIS

271
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
EXPERIENCE MUST BE BE FOR YOU.

272
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

273
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
OUR FAMILY AND OUR SUPPORT YOU

274
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
AS WELL.

275
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
MY DAUGHTER EMILY WOULD BE ONE

276
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
OF THE FIRST ONES THAT BE

277
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
STANDING AND GIVING HER LOVE

278
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
AND SUPPORT TO ALL THOSE

279
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
VICTIMS BECAUSE THAT'S THE

280
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
TYPE OF PERSON THAT SHE IS.

281
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
NOT BECAUSE OF ANY PARENTING

282
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
THAT MY WIFE AND I COULD HAVE

283
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
DONE, BUT BECAUSE THOSE ARE

284
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
THE GIFTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO

285
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
HER BY HER HEAVENLY FATHER.

286
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
>> THAT'S AN AMAZING STATEMENT

287
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
FROM ROBBIE PARKER.

288
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
YOU CAN SEE THAT HE'S

289
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
DEFINITELY TORN WITH THE LOSS

290
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
OF HIS DAUGHTER.

291
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THE OLDEST DAUGHTER AND HE

292
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
WENT ON TO EXPLAIN WHAT KIND

293
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
OF PERSON EMILY IS, SHE WAS AN

294
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
ARTIST AND SHE CARRIED AROUND

295
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
MARKERS AND IN FACT, SHE JUST

296
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
RECENTLY LOST HER GRANDFATHER

297
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
AND SHE WOULD DRAW CARDS, SHE

298
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
WAS A BUDDING ARTIST AND SHE

299
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
WOULD DRAW CARDS FOR PEOPLE

300
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
WHO WERE IN PAIN OR AGONY TO

301
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
TRY TO EASE THEIR BURDEN AND

302
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
WHEN HER GRANDFATHER LYING IN

303
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
THE CASKET.

304
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
SHE DREW A CARD AND PUTS IT IN

305
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
THE CASKET WITH A MESSAGE OF

306
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
ENCOURAGEMENT TO HER GRANDPA.

307
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
AND YOU SEE ROBBIE'S

308
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
WILLINGNESS TO FORGIVE, SO

309
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
POWERFUL AND SO POIGNANT FOR

310
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
THE TIMES IN WHICH WE LIVE

311
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
RIGHT NOW WHERE WE DO NEED

312
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
THAT, THAT PRECIOUS BALM OF

313
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
FORGIVENESS AND I REMEMBER

314
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING,

315
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
BUT IT'S SO HARD, BUT WHEN YOU

316
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
BRING A COMMUNITY TOGETHER

317
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000

323
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
IT'S HARD TO SAY THAT I'D BE

324
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
THIS FOR GIVING AND ROBBIE,

325
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
YOU HOPE NEVER HAVING TO TALK

SIX-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

DOING I SAID I WAS DOING WELL.

335
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME AND

336
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS

337
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
OUT THE DOOR.

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000

344
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
SHE LOOKED LIKE A LITTLE ANGEL

345
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
AND A DOLL.

346

STRONG WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

590
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
AND WHAT'S INTERESTING, IT

591
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
HAPPENS MORE IN THE UNITED

WE'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG.
>> Dave: YEAH, OF COURSE THERE

594
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
WAS A TIME WHEN THESE THINGS

595
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
WERE NOT HEARD OF, UNCOMMON.

596
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
NOW THEY'RE COMMON AND GOING

597
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
BACK TO COLUMBINE THAT'S

598
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
UNFORTUNATELY WHERE IT STARTED

599
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
AND GERALDO RIVERA TAKES A

600
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
LOOK BACK AT HOW THIS

601
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
UNFORTUNATE AND AS UNFORTUNATE

602
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
HAS BECOME A TREND.

603
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
>> IT WAS REALLY KIND OF

604
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
MAYHEM IN THE ROOM, TRYING TO

FIND YOUR KIDS AND MAKING SURE

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
THEY'RE SAFE AND THE SITUATION

607
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
AND MAKING SURE EVERYBODY ELSE

608
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
IS SAFE.

612
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE.

613
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
YOU READ IT IN THE PAPER AND

THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING HAPPEN

617
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
SO CLOSE TO HOME, I THINK I'M

618
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000

DO KNOW THAT HE HAD A

1106
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
DIAGNOSIS OF SOME KIND,

1107
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
WHETHER IT'S ASPERGER'S

1108
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
SYNDROME OR SOMETHING ELSE, OR

1109
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
WHETHER THIS WAS A

1110
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
MISDIAGNOSIS NEEDS TO BE

1111
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
ESTABLISHED.

1112
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
IT ALSO HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD

1113
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
WHY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN

1114
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
FIREARMS BY A MOTHER WHO

1115
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
DIDN'T SAFEGUARD THOSE

1116
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
FIREARMS FROM HER DISTURBED

1117
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
SON AND WHO REMOVED HIM FROM

1118
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
THE SCHOOL BECAUSE SHE FELT HE

1119
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
WASN'T WELL-SERVED THERE.

1120
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
WHAT WAS THAT?

1121
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
WAS THAT HER COMMANDEERING HIS

1122
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
EXISTENCE OR SERVING HIM IN A

1123
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
SPECIAL WAY?
WHAT WERE THE INJURIES EARLY

1124
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
ON PSYCHOLOGICALLY THAT LED

1125
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
THIS YOUNG MAN TO THEN LEAVE

1126
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
SUCH HORRIBLE EVIDENCE OF WHAT

1127
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I PRESUME TO BE HIS OWN

1128
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
INTERNAL SENSE OF HAVING BEEN

1129
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
DESTROYED?

1130
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE MAY

1131
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
SEE.
WE ALSO SEE EVIDENCE OF A

1132
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
MENTAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN

1133
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
UTTER DISARRAY HERE, BECAUSE

1134
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
THAT'S WHAT OUR MENTAL HEALTH

1135
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
CARE SYSTEM IS, COMPLETELY

1136
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
UNRELIABLE, UNDERSTAFFED, TOO

1137
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
LITTLE EXPERTISE, NOT KNOWING

1138
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
WHICH WAY TO TURN WITH SOMEONE

1139
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
LIKE THIS.
>> DOC, INEVITABLY THE GUN

1140
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
CONTROL ARGUMENT HAS BEGUN.

1141
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ENOUGH

1142
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
SAID, THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM

1143
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
IN THIS COUNTRY.

1144
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
HOW DOES IT NEED TO CHANGE?

1145
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
>> THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO, I

1146
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
PROMISE THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO

1147
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
WITH GUN CONTROL.

1148
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
THESE WERE LEGALLY BOUGHT

1149
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
FIREARMS, HELD BY A WOMEN WHO

1150
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
BOUGHT THEM AT STORES, NOT GUN

1151
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
SHOWS AS FAR AS I KNOW.

1152
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN

1153
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
AMERICA WE'VE PUSHED DOWN THE

1154
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
LOWEST LEVEL THE EXPERTISE

1155
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
THAT SHOULD BE HIGHEST LEVEL.

1156
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
WE HAVE KIDS LIKE THIS AND

1157
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
WORSE, WHO ALREADY EXPRESSING

1158
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
VIOLENT FANTASIES BEING

1159
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
TREATED BY NEWLY MINTED SOCIAL

1160
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
WORKERS WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN

1161
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
SCHOOLED IN INTROSPECTIVE

1162
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
TECHNIQUES AND TRAINING, AND

1163
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
WHY?

1164
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL PAY
ONLY THEM.

1165
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
WE HAVE THEIR MEDICINES

1166
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
PRESCRIBED BY NURSE

1167
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
CLINICIANS.

1168
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
WHY?

1169
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
BECAUSE THE INSURANCE COMPANY
WON'T PAY PSYCHIATRISTS TO DO

1170
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
THAT WORK.

1171
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
WE HAVE NO CONNECTION BETWEEN

1172
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
OUR CRISIS AND OUR COMMUNITY

1173
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS AND OUR

1174
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
POLICE, OUR JUDICIARY AND OUR

1175
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
HOSPITAL.

1176
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
WE HAVE PEOPLE IN E.R.'S WHO

1177
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
ARE PSYCHIATRY RESIDENTS AND

1178
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
PSYCHIATRISTS WHO DON'T

1179
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
LITERALLY KNOW WHO TO CALL IF

1180
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
THEY HAVE A PSYCHIATRIC

1181
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
PATIENT COME INTO THE E.R.,

1182
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
WHO IS EXPRESSING VIOLENCE

1183
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
SHORT OF MURDER, BUT FOR WHOM

1184
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
THEY'RE TERRIBLY CONCERNED.

1185
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
WE STILL HAVE ALL KINDS OF

1186
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
EXPERTS, QUOTES, UNQUOTE.

1187
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
PSYCHIATRISTS AND SOCIAL

1188
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
WORKERS AND OTHERS WHO BELIEVE

1189
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
WHEN THEY SAY HE WON'T DO IT,

1190
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
GET TO THE E.R. AFTER THEY SIT

1191
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
IN A PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE I

1192
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
DO INTEND TO HARM PEOPLE AND

1193
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
THEY SHOULD GO HOME BECAUSE

1194
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
THEY'RE QUOTE, UNQUOTE,

1195
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
CONTRACTED FOR SAFETY AND THE

1196
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
INSURANCE COMPANY WON'T PAY TO

1197
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
ADMIT THEM TO THE HOSPITAL.

1198
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE A

1199
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
MENTAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, WE

1200
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
HAVE A VARIETY OF CLINICIANS

1201
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
POORLY TRAINED, NOT IN ANY WAY

1202
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
INTEGRATED WITH NO MARCHING

1203
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
ORDERS WITH WHAT TO DO WITH

1204
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
THE POTENTIALLY VIOLENTLY ILL.

1205
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
>> MYSELF A PARENT OF THREE,

1206
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I'M ASTOUNDED, TIME AND TIME

1207
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
AGAIN, THE PARENTS ARE MISSING

1208
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
OBVIOUS WARNING SIGNS AND ONE

1209
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
OF THEM MAY BE THE VIOLENT

1210
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
VIDEO GAMES WE'VE HEARD SO
MUCH ABOUT.

1211
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I'VE MENTIONED THAT I WAS

1212
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
COVERING THE COLUMBINE

1213
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
SHOOTING MANY, MANY YEARS AGO.

1214
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
AND THOSE TWO SHOOTSERS WERE

1215
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
PLAYING SOME OF VIOLENT VIDEO

1216
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
GAMES THAT HAVE FAR EVOLVED

1217
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
OVER THE YEARS AND WE'VE HEARD

1218
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
ABOUT IN LATEST SHOOTER,

1219
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
HAVING PLAYED SOME FANTASY

1220
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
WEAPON RELATED VIDEO GAMES,

1221
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
HOW BIG A PROBLEM ARE THEY?

1222
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
AND WHAT DO PARENTS NEED TO

1223
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
KNOW?

1224
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
>> I THINK THE WHOLE

1225
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
WATERFRONT HAS TO BE LOOKED AT

1226
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
HERE, FROM VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES

1227
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
TO THE DESENSETIZATION OF

1228
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
PEOPLE THROUGH EVERYTHING FROM

1229
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
FACEBOOK, WHERE YOU CREATE

1230
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
FALSE FRIENDS AND FICTIONALIZE

1231
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
YOUR PROFILE, TO OBVIOUSLY,

1232
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
THESE VIDEO GAMES, BUT BEYOND

1233
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
NA, LET'S LOOK AT THE WHOLE OF

1234
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
THE THINGS INVOLVING

1235
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
TECHNOLOGY THAT REMOVE US FROM

1236
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
OUR FEELINGS, THAT DESTROY OUR

1237
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
CAPACITY FOR EMPATHY AND FOR

1238
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
THE FRAGILE AMONG US, IT CAN

1239
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
COMPLETELY ANNIHILATE THAT

1240
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
CAPACITY FOR EMPATHY AND THEN

1241
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
LET'S LOOK AT THE PERSONAL.

1242
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
THIS MOTHER ARMED HER

1243
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
DISTURBED SON WITH WEAPONS OF

1244
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
MASS DESTRUCTION, WITH THE

1245
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, WHAT

1246
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
SHORT OF WOMAN WE SHOULD TALK

1247
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
ABOUT, WE SHOULD KNOW, IS THIS

1248
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
AN INTENSITY PERSONAL FAMILY

1249
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
DRAMA IN WHICH A PERSON WAS

1250
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
CREATED WITHOUT EMPATHY OR

1251
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
SOMETHING ELSE.

1252
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
>> AND WE CERTAINLY NEED TO

1253
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
LOOK AT THE AGE GROUP FROM THE

1254
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000

1270
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
KEITH ABLOW TALKING ABOUT THE

1271
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
THE GUNMAN'S MOTHER.

1272
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
WE KNOW THAT SHE WAS A GUN

1273
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
ENTHUSIAST AND SHE WAS A GUN

1274
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
COLLECTOR.

1275
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
SHE HAD GUNS IN HER HOME AND

1276
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
THERE ARE REPORTS THAT SHE

1277
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000

THERE ARE OTHER REPORTS, TO

1281
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
FLESH OUT THE PICTURE OF THIS

1282
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
MAN FROM FAMILY MEMBERS WHO

1283
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
SAID SHE WAS AN INCREDIBLY

1284
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
DEDICATED LOVING MOTHER THAT

1285
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000

01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
GUNS.

>> Alisyn: SEMI AUTOMATICS.

1467
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
>> Kelly: AND POLICE USE THESE

1468
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
WEAPONS AND SECRET SERVICE HAD

1469
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
THE WEAPONS AND HIS MOTHER

1470
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
NANCY WAS A COLLECTOR OF THESE

1471
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
GUNS AND TAUGHT HER SON HOW TO

1472
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
SHOOT.

1473
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
AND NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT,

1474
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
PEOPLE TRAIN EACH OTHER TO USE

1475
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
THE GUNS AND MAY FIND IT AS A

1476
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
SPORT, BUT THIS WAS A TERRIBLE

1477
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
SCENE THAT PERHAPS NO ONE SAW

1478
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
AND POLICE ARE PUTTING

1479
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
TOGETHER THE EVIDENCE TO FIND

1480
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
OUT WHAT MAY HAVE LED TO THIS.

1481
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
>> Alisyn: AND IT'S JUST MORE

1482
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
COMPLICATED BECAUSE WE NOW

1483
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
KNOW THAT THE SHOOTER HAD

1484
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, WHICH IS

1485
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
A SPECTRUM OF AUTISM AND NO

1486
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
ONE KNOWS IT'S LINKED TO

1487
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
VIOLENCE NO HISTORY OF LEADING

1488
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
TO VIOLENCE, BUT HIS BROTHER

1489
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
SAID A PERSONALITY DISORDER

1490
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
AND WHY EYEBROWS WERE RAISED

1491
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
WHY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN

1492
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
WITH HER TO THE SHOOTING RANGE

1493
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
AND ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK

1494
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
POST SHE REGULARLY TOOK HIM TO

1495
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
THE SHOOTING RANGE.

1496
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
AND ALL OF THESE ANSWERS HAVE

1497
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
TO COME OUT, BUT PEOPLE SAY

1498
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
THAT NANCY LANZA, THE FIRST

1499
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
VICTIM, WAS INCREDIBLY

1500
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
DEDICATED MOTHER AND MADE

1501
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
SACRIFICES FOR HER SON AND

1502
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
OTHER SON.

NOTHING YOU CAN SAY TO THEM TO

1511
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
CONSOLE THEM, IT'S JUST, IT'S

1512

COMPASSION.
LOVE AS IT HAS POURED IN FROM

WE APPRECIATE THE UPDATE.

1600
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THE
FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS,

1601
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
OBVIOUSLY, TOO OVERWHELMED

1602
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
WITH GRIEF TO SPEAK OUT IF

1603
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
THEY EVER WILL, BUT A COUPLE

HAVE AND WHAT ONE FATHER HAS

1605
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
COME OUT TO SAY HAS BEEN

1606
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
BEYOND INSPIRATIONAL IN TERMS

1607
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
OF HIS STRENGTH.

1608
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
ROBBIE PARKER IS THE FATHER OF

1609
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
ONE OF THE YOUNGEST VICTIMS,

HER NAME EMILIE PARKER, SIX

1611
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
YEARS OLD AND HE CAME OUT TO

1612
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
TALK ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER AND

1613
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
THE COMPASSION HE FEELS FOR

1614
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
THE SHOOTER'S FAMILY.

1615
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, I'D REALLY

1616
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
LIKE TO OFFER OUR DEEPEST TO

1617
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
ALL THE FAMILIES WHO WERE

1618
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THIS

1619
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
SHOOTING.

1620
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
IT'S A HORRIFIC TRAGEDY AND WE

1621
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
WANTED EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT

1622
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
OUR HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO

1623
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
OUT TO THEM.

1624
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
THIS INCLUDES THE FAMILY OF

1625
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
THE SHOOTER.

1626
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD THIS

1627
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
EXPERIENCE MUST BE FOR YOU.

1628
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

1629
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000

OUR SUPPORT GO OUT TO YOU AS

1631
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
WELL.

1632
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,000
MY DAUGHTER EMILIE WOULD BE

1633
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE

1634
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
STANDING AND GIVING HER LOVE

1635
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
AND SUPPORT TO THOSE VICTIMS

1636
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF

1637
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
PERSON THAT SHE IS.

1638
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
NOT BECAUSE OF ANY PARENTING

1639
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
THAT MY WIFE AND I HAVE DONE,

1640
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
BUT BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE

1641
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
GIFTS GIVEN TO HER BY HER

1642
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
HEAVENLY FATHER.

1643
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
>> Kelly: YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU

1644
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
HEAR THAT, YOU THINK HOW IS IT

1645
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
POSSIBLE THAT A MAN WHO HAS

1646

SO, ON THIS DAY, THE FACT THAT

1829
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
SHE SACRIFICED HERSELF, WHAT

1830
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
IS THE COMMUNITY LOSING IN

1831
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
THIS WONDERFUL LEADER WHO

1832
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
INSPIRED SO MANY TEACHERS AND

1833
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
STUDENTS?
>> YEAH, SHE DID TAKE THIS

1834
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
VERY SERIOUSLY, LIKE I SAID,

1835
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
WE HAD FRANK DISCUSSIONS AND

1836
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
WE'VE TRAINED, WE'VE

1837
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
PRACTICED, AND SHE KNEW THAT

1838
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF HER

1839
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
CHILDREN WERE ABSOLUTELY

1840
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
PARAMOUNT.

1841
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I THINK THAT--
THE THING THAT WE NEED TO COME

1842
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
AWAY FROM THIS WAS THE FACT

1843
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
THAT SHE ACTUALLY SAVED A

1844
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
GREAT MANY LIVES AND TAKE INTO

1845
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
ACTIONS THAT SHE DID, THAT

1846
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
SHOOTER HAD THE CAPABILITY OF

1847
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
KILLING MUCH MORE IN THIS

1848
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
TRAGEDY WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR

1849
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
WORSE IF IT WASN'T FOR HER

1850
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
HEROIC ACTIONS, SO, I THINK

1851
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
THAT THAT LOSS CERTAINLY IS

1852
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
EXTREMELY HEART FELT AND WE'RE

1853
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
SADDENED, BUT IN THE OTHER

1854
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
INSTANCE, IT GIVES ME GREAT

1855
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
PLEASURE TO KNOW THAT SHE DID

1856
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
WHAT SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO

1857
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE

1858
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
TYPES OF THINGS, IN OUR

1859
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
WILDEST DREAMS DID WE EVER
THINK THAT THE CONVERSATION

1860

THAT HER AND I ACTUALLY HAD

1861
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
WOULD UNFOLD INTO REALITY AND

1862
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
THEN CAUSING THE LOSS OF HER

1863

1864
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000

1872

AND THEN IT WAS HORROR AND

01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
NOW, THIS PARTICULAR CHURCH

2031
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000

THE CHILDREN OF THE CHURCH

HELD THEIR LIVE NATIVITY SCENE

2042
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
AND SADLY ONE OF THE GIRLS WHO

2043
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
WAS KILLED IN THE ATTACK ON

2044
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
THE SCHOOL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

2045
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
AN ANGEL IN THAT PRODUCTION.

2046
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU,

2047
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
WHAT THE MINISTER OF ST. ROSE

2048
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
SHARED WITH REUTERS.

2049
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
HE SAYS OF THIS LITTLE

2050
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

2051
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN

2052
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
ANGEL IN THE PLAY AND NOW SHE

2053
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000

2058

ONE OF THE VICTIM'S FATHERS

2059
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
WHO CAME OUT AND SPOKE NOT

2060
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
ABOUT ANGER TOWARD THE FAMILY

2061
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
OF THE SHOOTER, BUT FOR

2062
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
FORGIVENESS, WHICH QUITE

2063
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
FRANKLY ASTOUNDED ME AS A

2064
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000

WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE

2075
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
POSSIBILITY OF WHAT

2076
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
PARISHIONERS THERE MIGHT BE

2077
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000

KELLY?

2081
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
>> I WOULD HAVE THE SAME -- I

2082
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
WOULD HAVE THE SAME PHILOSOPHY

2083
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
OR BELIEF BECAUSE OF MY FAITH

2084
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,000
IN GOD, I WOULD HAVE THE SAME

2085
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
KIND OF REACTION THAT ROBBIE

2086
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
HAS, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO

2087
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
EXPRESS THAT, AND PAINFUL, I

2088
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000

2089
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
YOU AND I HAVE CHILDREN, I

2090
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000

2093
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
VICERAL AND YET AT THE SAME

2094
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
TIME YOU HAVE TO HAVE

2095
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
SOMETHING THAT CAN MAKE SENSE

2096
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
OF IT ALL.

2097
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
MAKING SENSE OF THE SENSELESS

2098
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
AND FINDING HOPE FOR THE

2099
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
HOPELESS AND TO ME, ONLY GOD

2100
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
CAN DO THAT, NO LAW IN THE

2101
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
LAND CAN DO THAT AND NO HE

2102
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
ANALOGY OF CIRCUMSTANCES CAN

2103
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
DO THAT, BUT MY FAITH IS MY

2104
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
ROCK AND MY BED ROCK AND WE

2105
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000

01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
THAT'S WHAT ROBBIE PARKER HAS

2107
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
DISPLAYED IN THIS, LOSING HIS

2108
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
OLDEST DAUGHTER, HIS LOVE.

2109
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
>> Dave: YEAH.

2110
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
>> Kelly: AND THEN MOVING
FORWARD TO SAY THAT I FORGIVE,

2111
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
AND FROM THAT FORGIVENESS, HE

2112
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
WILL FIND NOT ONLY

2113
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
RECONCILIATION, BUT ALSO

RESTORATION AND HEALING, IT

2115
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
WILL NEVER BE THE SAME, NEVER

2116
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
BE THE SAME, BUT THERE WILL BE

2117
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
HEALING.

2118
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000

01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
>> THE CHILDREN OBVIOUSLY WERE

2186
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
VERY SHAKEN, THEY WERE CRYING

2187
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
IN THE CLOSET.

2188
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
WHEN THEY WERE LEAVING THE

2189
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
POLICE TOLD THEM TO HOLD HANDS

2190
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
AND CLOSE THEIR EYES.

2191
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
>> AND THEY HAVE THEIR ENTIRE

2192
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
LIVES AHEAD OF THEM.

01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:53,000
AND FIRST DATES, GRADUATIONS.GR.

OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING

2203
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000

01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
SO FROM ALL OF US AT FOX NEWS

2211
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I'VE GOT TO SAY OUR PRAYER,

2212
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
CONDOLENCES AND SUPPORT GO OUT

2213
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
TO THE PEOPLE IN NEWTOWN,

2214
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
CONNECTICUT.

2215
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
>> Alisyn: ONE.
THINGS WE CLING TO DURING THAT

2216
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
OBVIOUSLY INCREDIBLY GRIEF

2217
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
STRICKEN TIME

2218
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,000
HARROWING STORIES OF PEOPLE

2219
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,000
WHO BRAVED THE THE DANGER AND

2220
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
SHELTERED THE KIDS AND ONE OF

2221
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
THEM IS 27-YEAR-OLD TEACHER

2222
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
VICTORIA SOTO.

2223
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
AND THERE ARE VAGUE DETAILS

2224
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
BECAUSE A LOT HAS BEEN

2225
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
REPORTED BY HER SIX AND

2226
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
SEVEN-YEAR-OLD STUDENT AND

2227
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT SHE DID,

2228
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
BUT SHE SHIELDED THEM.

2229
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
ONE SHE QUICKLY PUT THEM INTO

2230
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
A CLOSET AND CONFRONTED THEM

2231
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
AND THE GUNMAN ASKED HER, AND

2232
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
SHE SAID I SENT THEM TO THE

2233
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
GYM.
AND LIED TO THEM.

2234
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,000
AND THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HE

2235
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
STARTED FIRING AND SHIELDED

2236
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
THEM WITH HER BODY AND SHE

2237
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
DIED AND THEY SURVIVED.

2238
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
>> NOT JUST THAT, BUT TO THINK

2239
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
OF THE TEACHERS THAT TEACH AT

2240
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:49,000
THAT SCHOOL, YOUR SCHOOL, AND

2241
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND A

2242
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
GOOD TIME WHAT THEY DO FOR
YOUR KIDS NOT JUST TEACHING

2243
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
THEM, BUT CARING AND

2244
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
PROTECTING THEM THE BEST THEY

2245
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
CAN.

2246
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
ONE OF THE PHOTOS IS THE

2247
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
SISTER OF THIS 27-YEAR-OLD

2248
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
TEACHER, THAT'S GILLIAN SOTO,

2249
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
THERE, OBVIOUSLY, UPON HEARING

2250
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
THE NEWS OF HER SISTER, SOME

2251
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
OF THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY

2252
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
TALKED ABOUT THEIR WONDERFUL

2253
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
27-YEAR-OLD TEACHER AND HERE

2254
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
IS WHAT THEY SAID.

2255
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
>> I DIDN'T KNOW HER AT ALL,

2256
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:23,000
BUT I'M A MOM AND IT COULD

2257
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
HAVE BEEN MY KID AND WHAT SHE

2258
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
DID A VERY VERY--

2259
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
THE PAIN, HOW THOSE MOTHERS

2260
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
MUST BE FEELING AT THIS TIME

2261
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
BECAUSE THIS IS MY ONLY CHILD,

2262
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
BUT I COULDN'T PICTURE THAT,

2263
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY

2264
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
BECAUSE SHE SAVED A LOT OF

2265
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
KIDS LIVES.

2266
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
>> I JUST FEEL SAD THAT SHE'S

2267
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
IN A THE BETTER PLACE.

2268
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
>> AND ONE OF THE THEMES THAT

2269
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
HAS COME UP OVER AND OVER

2270
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
AGAIN IN THE PAST 48 HOURS

2271
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING

2272
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
ABOUT THIS, AS EVERYBODY TRIES

2273
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CAN WE EVER

2274
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
DO TO PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE

2275
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN, HOW

2276
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
CAN WE EKE OUT SOME MESSAGE

2277
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
HERE SO THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS

2278
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
SPARED GRIEF AND THE COMMON

2279
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
THEME, IT HASN'T, QUITE

2280
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
FRANKLY, BEEN ABOUT GUN

2281
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
CONTROL, IT'S BEEN ABOUT THE

2282
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
MENTAL HEALTH INDUSTRY AND

2283
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
THAT SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG

2284
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
WITH THESE MENTAL HEALTH IN

2285
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
THIS COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY OF

2286
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
TROUBLED YOUNG MEN WHO THEN

2287
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
SOMEHOW GAIN ACCESS TO

2288
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
WEAPONS, FOR THE LIONS SHARE

2289
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS HAS BEEN

01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
CARRIED OUT BY TEENAGE OR

YOUNG MEN AND DR. KEITH ABLOW

2292
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
SPOKE IN SUCH A COMPELLING AND

2293
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
COMPREHENSIVE WAY ABOUT ALL OF

2294
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
THIS.

2295
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
>> WE'LL ALSO SEE EVIDENCE OF

2296
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
A MENTAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN

2297
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
UTTER DISARRAY HERE, BECAUSE

2298
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
THAT'S WHAT OUR MENTAL HEALTH

2299
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,000
CARE SYSTEM IS, COMPLETELY

2300
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
UNRELIABLE, UNDERSTAFFED, TOO

2301
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
LITTLE EXPERTISE, AND NOT

2302
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
KNOWING WHICH WAY TO TURN WITH

2303
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
SOMEONE LIKE THIS.

2304
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
>> THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE

2305
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
SYSTEM IN AMERICA, WE HAVE

2306
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
PUSHED DOWN TO THE LOWEST

2307
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
LEVELS, THE EXPERTISE THAT

2308
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
SHOULD BE AT THE HIGHEST

2309
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
LEVEL, WE HAVE KIDS LIKE THIS,

2310
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
AND WORSE.

2311
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
WHO ARE ALREADY EXPRESSING

2312
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
VIOLENT FANTASIES, BEING

2313
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
TREATED BY NEWLY MINTED SOCIAL

2314
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
WORKERS WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN

2315
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
SCHOOLED IN INTROSPECTIVE

2316
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000

WITH VIOLENCE ON A DAY-TO-DAY

2318

WE HAVE NO FORENSIC TRAINING

2320
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
WHY, BECAUSE INSURANCE

2321
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,000
COMPANIES PAY ONLY THEM.

2322
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
WE HAVE INSURANCE COMPANIES

2323
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
WON'T PAY PSYCHIATRIST TO DO

2324
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
THAT WORK.

2325
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
WE HAVE NO CONNECTION BETWEEN

WE HAVE PEOPLE IN E.R. WHO ARE

PSYCHIATRY RESIDENTS AND

2332
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
PSYCHIATRISTS WHO DON'T

01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
IF SOMEBODY SAYS I WON'T DO

2344
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,000
IT, WHEN THEY GET TO THE E.R.

2345
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
AFTER THEY SIT SAID IN A

2346
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE I DO

2347
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
INTEND TO HARM PEOPLE BECAUSE

01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
THEY'RE QUOTE, UNQUOTE,

FOR THEM TO BE IN THE THE
HOSPITAL.

2352
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE A
MENTAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

2353
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
WE HAVE A VARIETY OF

2354
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
CLINICIANS, POORLY TRAINED,

2355
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
NOT IN ANY WAY INTEGRATED,

2356
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
WITH NO MARCHING ORDERS AS TO

01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
WHAT TO DO WITH THE

>> Dave: YOU DON'T WANT TO

2360
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
POLITICIZE THIS, BUT IT'S HARD

2361
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
TO IMAGINE THAT SYSTEM GETTING

2362
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
ANY BETTER IN THE WAKE OF OUR

RENEWED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM,

HOW THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN

THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN MADE

2366
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
OVER.

2367
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE IT

2368
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
GETTING BETTER ON THAT FRONT

2369
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
OVER THE THE NEXT COUPLE OF

2370
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000

>> Kelly: TO THIS POINT

2371
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
THOUGH, THERE ARE SOME STATES

2372
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
THAT ARE BEING MORE PROACTIVE

2373
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
NOW, BECAUSE THEY REALIZE

2374
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
THERE ARE ISSUES OUT THERE AND

2375
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
WHEN THEY HEAR OF SOMETHING,

2376
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000
OR THERE'S A THREAT BEING

2377
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
MADE.

2378
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
MAYBE SOME PARANOID

2379
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
SCHIZOPHRENIA BEHAVIOR.

2380
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
THEY WILL, THOSE EMERGENCY

2381
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
CLINICIANS WILL MAKE CALLS TO

2382
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE GUARDIANS AND

2383
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
STATE AUTHORITIES AND SAY WE

2384
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
THINK THERE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM

2385
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
AND CHECK THIS GUY OUT.

2386
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN

2387
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION, BUT

2388
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
WE DO KNOW PERHAPS THERE WERE

2389
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
ISSUES GOING ON AND PEOPLE

TALKING ABOUT ADAM LANZA AS

2391
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
BEING A LONER, SOMEONE WHO

2392
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
EVEN WENT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL

2393
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
VERY MUCH ALONE, VERY SMART,

2394
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
BRILLIANT, BUT YET, VISIBLY

2395
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
DISTURBED.
SO WE DON'T KNOW.

2396
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
WE KNOW THAT HE GAINED ACCESS

2397
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
TO THE GUNS THROUGH HIS

2398
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,000
MOTHER, NANCY LANZA, WHO WAS A

2399
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
GUN COLLECTOR.

2400
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
SO, WE HAVE TO FIND OUT ALL

2401
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
THE DETAILS.

2402
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
POLICE ARE STILL

2403
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
INVESTIGATING, PUTTING THE
PIECESES TOGETHER, BUT I THINK

2404
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
IT'S VERY KEY AND TELLING WHAT

2405
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
DR. KEITH ABLOW TALKED ABOUT

2406
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000

01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
HE WENT TON SAY THAT THERE'S

2412
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
MENTAL ISSUE PROBLEM.

2413
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000

2415
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
WE'VE GOT TO PRAY FOR THE

2416
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,000

GOOD EVIDENCE ON THE SHOOTER.

EVIDENCE BE?

I THINK IT IS.

LET ME TAKE YOU BACK A LITTLE

2467
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
BIT.

2468
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
YOU KNOW, I THINK THE SCHOOL

2469
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
SYSTEM, DAVE, WAS VERY

2470
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
FAMILIAR WITH LANZA, AND LET

2471
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
ME TELL YOU WHY.

2472
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
I ALSO THINK THE POLICE

2473
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
DEPARTMENT IN THAT COMMUNITY

2474
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
WAS FAMILIAR WITH LANZA.

2475
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
LOOK, THIS WHOLE SITUATION

2476
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,000
STARTED MONTHS AGO, IT JUST

2477
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
DIDN'T HAPPEN THAT FRIDAY

2478
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
MORNING.
I BELIEVE, AND THIS IS ALL

2479
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,000
SPECULATION, I'M NOT OBVIOUSLY

2480
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION,

2481
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
BUT I BELIEVE LANZA HAD MADE

2482
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
PREVIOUS THREATS TO THAT

2483
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
SCHOOL AS OF RECENT.

2484
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
AND WHY DO I BELIEVE THAT?

2485
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW ALL THE

2486
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
REPORTS STATED THAT THE SCHOOL

2487
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,000
RECENTLY HAD AN ELABORATE

2488
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
SECURITY SYSTEM INSTALLED.

2489
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
WHY DID THEY HAVE TO SYSTEM

2490
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,000
STALLED?

2491
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,000
THAT SYSTEM IS UNUSUAL FOR THE

2492
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
THE REASON I BELIEVE THEY DID,

2493
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
LANZA HAD MADE SOME THREATS.

2494
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
WHY DID HE SHOOT HIS MOTHER.

2495
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
HERE IS WHY I BELIEVE HE

2496
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
KILLED HIS MOTHER FRIDAY

2497
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
MORNING, A FAMILY MEMBER,

2498
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,000
DAVE, HAS TO HAVE ANOTHER

2499
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
FAMILY MEMBER PROBATED IF

2500
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
THEY'RE SHOWING SIGNS OF

2501
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
MENTAL ILLNESS.

2502
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
IN ORDER TO HAVE THEM PROBATED

2503
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
BY THE COURT YOU HAVE TO PUT

2504
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
TOGETHER COLLECTION OF

2505
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
EVIDENCE, INFORMATION, THAT'S
GOOD EVIDENCE THAT THE POLICE

2506
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
DEPARTMENT, THE POLICE CHIEF

2507
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
WAS TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY

2508
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
WHEN HE SAID WE HAVE GOOD

2509
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
EVIDENCE.
WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IS

2510
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
THAT THE MOTHER WAS PROBABLY

2511
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
STARTING TO PUT ALL THIS HAVE

2512
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
STUFF TOGETHER.

2513
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
LANZA CAME IN, LANZA WAS

2514
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
UPSET.
HE COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT HIS

2515
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
MOTHER WOULD DO THIS TO HIM.

2516
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
AND SO, THAT'S WHY HE KILLED

2517
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
HER, AND THEN HE WENT TO THE

2518
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
SCHOOL.

2519
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
NOW, WHEN HE GOT TO THE

2520
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
SCHOOL, DAVE, HE COULDN'T GET

2521
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
IN, YOU KNOW WHY?

2522
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
THEY HAD THAT ELABORATE

2523
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,000
SECURITY SYSTEM THEY DID NOT

2524
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
HAVE THE SYSTEM WHEN HE FIRST

2525
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
WENT TO THE SCHOOL.

2526
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
AND I THINK IT STARTED MONTHS

2527
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,000
AGO, I DON'T THINK IT JUST

2528
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
STARTED THIS PAST WEEK.

2529
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
>> Dave: AND JUST TO BE CLEAR

2530
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
WE HAVE NO WORD CONFIRMING ANY

2531
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
THREATS TO THE POLICE, THE

2532
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
SCHOOL.

2533
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Dave: I LIVE ABOUT 40

2534
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
MINUTES AWAY.

2535
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
MY CHILDREN'S ELEMENTARY

2536
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
SCHOOL HAS A SIMILAR SECURITY

2537
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
SYSTEM AND THAT'S NOT AT ALL

2538
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
BASED ON THREATS, EXPLAIN WHAT

2539
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,000
YOU MEAN BY THE PROCESS OF

2540
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
BEING PROBATED AND WHAT THAT

2541
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
EXACTLY WOULD MEAN FOR A

2542
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
20-YEAR-OLD AND THE MOTHER?

2543
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000

01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:27,000
NO, YOU BLAME SOMEBODY.

2729
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
AND THE FAMILY SAYS SHE'S A

2730
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
DEDICATED MOM AND SHE

2731
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
SACRIFICED A LOT, INCLUDING, A

2732
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
CAREER, AND TO GIVE TO HER SON

2733
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
SHE THEN HOME SCHOOLED.

2734
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK--

2735
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
>> I THINK SHE WAS PROBABLY

2736
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
MORE THAN CONNECTED ENOUGH,

2737
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
BUT AS HE WOULD EXPERIENCE IT,

2738
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
SHE MAY NOT AT ALL HAVE BEEN

2739
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
CONNECTED ENOUGH, IN OTHER

2740
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
WORDS, IS HE SUPPOSING YOU'RE

2741
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,000
BORN WITH A PECULIARITY, YOU

2742
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
NEED TO BE HANDCUFFED TO YOUR

2743
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,000
MOM SO SHE'S THERE ENOUGH.

2744
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
WHICH IS MORE THAN ANY MOTHER

2745
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,000
COULD BE OR CAN BE.

2746
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,000
AND LET'S SAY HE GETS 90% OF

2747
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
THE ATTENTION AND SHE GIVES

2748
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
50%, WHICH IS MORE THAN MOST

2749
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
KIDS NEED OR EVER GET.

2750
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,000
IN HIS MIND SHE'S SHORT

2751
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
CHANGING HIM.

2752
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
SO I SUSPECT THAT SHE GAVE,

2753
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,000
PROBABLY DOUBLE THE ATTENTION

2754
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
THAT SHE DID TO RYAN, THE

2755
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
BROTHER, OR AN AVERAGE MOTHER

2756
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
WOULD GIVE TO A DISTURBED KID

2757
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,000
OF THIS SORT, BUT IN HIS MIND,

2758
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
IT COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT,

2759
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,000
HOW HE EXPERIENCED IT AND

2760
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
THAT'S OF COURSE THE

2761
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
DETERMINING FACTOR.

2762
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
>> Kelly: WHERE DO YOU SEE
EVIL IN THIS CASE?

2763
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
BECAUSE THERE ARE SKEPTICS WHO

2764
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,000
WOULD TRY TO DISPROVE YOU,

2765
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
SAYING THAT EVIL DOES NOT

2766
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
EXIST, THEY'RE BORN UNDER
CONDITIONS AND THEY HAVE TO

2767
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
DEAL WITH INNATE CONDITIONS.

2768
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
BUT WHERE DO YOU FIND THE

2769
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
PROOF THAT EVIL DOES EXIST?

2770
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
>> EVIL IS NOT SOMETHING THAT
COMES IN THE SKY AND LANDS ON

2771
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
YOU, CERTAIN PEOPLE, LIKE A

2772
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
BLACK CLOUD THAT DISSENDS ON

2773
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
YOU.
THAT'S THE WRONG WAY TO THINK

2774
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
ABOUT IT.

2775
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
YOU THINK ABOUT THE EVIL AS

2776
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
THE WORD SIGNIFYING AS

2777
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
EMOTIONS AND ALL OF THE

2778
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
EXPERIENCE WHEN WE'RE

2779
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
CONFRONTED WITH SOMETHING THAT

2780
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
IS HORRIFYING.

2781
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
>> Kelly: AND GO INTO A DARK

2782
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
PLACE THEN.

2783
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
>> YES, AND SOME PEOPLE ARE

2784
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,000
BORN, A SMALL NUMBER OF

2785
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
PEOPLE, KNOCK ON WOOD, ARE

2786
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
BORN WITH A PREDISPOSITION TO

2787
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
DO THE SORT OF THING IF THEY

2788
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:30,000
HAVE VERY LITTLE CAPACITY FOR

2789
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
EMPATHY, IN OTHER WORDS, FOR

2790
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
THE FEELINGS AND CARING ABOUT

2791
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:37,000
THE FEELINGS OF OTHER PEOPLE.

2792
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:41,000
PSYCHOPATH, WE USE THE TERM

2793
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
PSYCHOPATH

2794
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,000
PSYCHOPATH TO CHARACTERIZE

2795
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLUS,

2796
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
INCAPABLE OF REMORSE OR GUILT.

2797
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:51,000
HAVE NO EMPATHY AND DON'T CARE

2798
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,000
ABOUT THE FETALS FEELINGS OF

2799
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,000
OTHERS.
I DON'T THINK THAT ADAM LANZA

2800
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
WAS A PSYCHOPATH.

2801
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
HE HAS THE SAME CAPACITY FOR

2802
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
EMPATHY.

2803
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
A PERSON LIKE THAT, EITHER

2804
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
TYPE CAN MOW DOWN A GROUP OF

2805
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
CHILDREN AS THOUGH WERE YOU

2806
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
SHOOTING TIN CANS ON THE

2807
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
FENCE.
>> Alisyn: DOCTOR, IT'S GREAT

2808
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
TO HAVE YOUR EXPERTISE WITH

2809
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,000
US.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING IN,

2810
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
A PLEASURE.

2811
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
>> Kelly: WHEN WE COME BACK,

2812
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
BRAND NEW INFORMATION ON WHERE

2813
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
THE INVESTIGATION IS HEADED

2814
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:23,000
TODAY, AND WE'LL BE LIVE FROM

2815
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
N

2816
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:29,000
NEW

2817
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000

02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
IT'S SUNDAY, DECEMBER 16TH.

2819
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
I'M ALISYN CAMEROTA.

2820
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,000
THANKS FOR JOINING US THIS

2821
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
MORNING.

2822
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THIS HOUR,

2823
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS HEADED TO

2824
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT TO SPEAK

2825
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,000
TO RESIDENTS OF SANDY HOOK

2826
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
SCHOOL.
AND WE'RE LEARNING WHAT

2827
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
HAPPENED, ABOUT THE VICTIMS OF

2828
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
THIS HORRIFIC MASSACRE AND

2829
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
WE'LL HAVE A LIVE REPORT IN

2830
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,000
MOMENTS.

2831
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
>> Dave: MORE QUESTIONS REMAIN

2832
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
THIS MORNING ABOUT WHY THIS

2833
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
HAPPENED.
WERE WARNING SIGNS MISSED

2834
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,000
ABOUT THE SHOOTER?

2835
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:14,000
WE'LL HAVE THE LATEST ON THE

2836
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
INVESTIGATION COMING UP.

2837
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,000
>> Kelly: AND THE HEROES OF

2838
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
THIS MASSACRE ARE COMING TO

2839
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
LIGHT.

2840
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,000
PRINCIPALS AND TEACHERS, WHO

2841
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
DID ALL THEY COULD TO PROTECT

2842
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
STUDENTS FROM THE GUNMAN, MORE

2843
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
ON THEIR BRAVERY STRAIGHT

2844
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,000
AHEAD.

2845
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000

>>  GOOD MORNING EVEN

2846
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
EVERYONE, WE APPRECIATE YOU

2847
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
BEING HERE.
AND APPRECIATE KELLY WRIGHT

2848
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,000
FILLING IN FOR CLAYTON, HEART

2849
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
BREAKING AROUND THE COUNTRY.

2850
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
WE HAVE NEW INFORMATION WE
WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU AND

2851
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
BRING TO YOU BECAUSE WE KNOW

2852
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
SO MANY PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW

2853
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
WHAT HAPPENED, HOW IT COULD

2854
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
HAPPEN AND HOW WE COULD

2855
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
PREVENT IT IN THE FUTURE.

2856
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,000
>> Dave: YEAH, A LOT OF

2857
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MENTAL

2858
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THIS

2859
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
COUNTRY, HOW IT NEEDS TO

2860
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,000
CHANGE WITH THE NEW

2861
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,000
INFORMATION COMING OUT ON

2862
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,000
SATURDAY WITH THE NAMES OF THE

2863
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,000
VICTIMS WERE RELEASED.

2864
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
WE NOW KNOW THERE WERE 12

2865
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,000
GIRLS, EIGHT BOYS AMONG THEM,

2866
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
20 CHILDREN KILLED IN NEWTOWN,

2867
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
CONNECTICUT ON FRIDAY, ALL OF

2868
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
THEM AGES SIX AND SEVEN YEARS

2869
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
OLD.
>> Alisyn: THAT PART WAS SO

2870
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
HEART WRENCHING TO READ EVEN

2871
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,000
JUST WORDS ON A PIECE OF

2872
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
PAPER, NAMES ON A PIECE OF

2873
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:20,000
PAPER.

2874
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,000
YOU'LL REMEMBER THE FIRST

2875
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,000
INFORMATION, EVEN PRESIDENT

2876
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,000
OBAMA HAD THE INFORMATION THAT

2877
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,000
THE VICTIMS WERE BETWEEN FIVE

2878
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,000
AND TEN YEARS OLD.

2879
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
AND NOW WE KNOW THEY WERE ALL

2880
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,000
SIX AND SEVEN YEARS OLD, ALL

2881
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,000
JUST PART OF, I BELIEVE, TWO

2882
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
DIFFERENT FIRST GRADE CLASSES.

2883
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,000
>> Kelly: AND WE MUST NOT

2884
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,000
FORGET THE TEACHERS WHO WERE

2885
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
ALSO KILLED IN THIS TRAGEDY

2886
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,000
AND THE HEROISM AND THE

2887
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:43,000
STORIES OF HOW THEY ACTUALLY,

2888
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
ONE TEACHER ACTUALLY VEALSHIELDG

2889
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
THE STUDENTS AND ONE REPORT
SHE SHIELDED STUDENTS FROM

2890
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
GUNFIRE AND MAYBE HID THEM IN

2891
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,000
A CUPBOARD AND CONFRONTED BY

2892
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,000
THE SHOOTER AND SAID THEY'RE

2893
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,000
ALL IN THE GYM.

2894
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
AND THE GUNMAN'S FATHER ALSO

2895
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,000
COMMENTING ON THE STORY.

2896
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000
>> Dave: WE'RE ALSO LEARNING

2897
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
MORE ABOUT THE GUNMAN'S FAMILY

2898
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
AND THE MOTHER DID HAVE ALL OF

2899
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,000
THESE WEAPONS LEGALLY

2900
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,000
REGISTERED AND ALL THE GUNS

2901
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,000
USED IN THE SHOOTING AT LEAST

2902
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:16,000
ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT WERE

2903
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:21,000
REGISTERED TO THE SHOOT'S

2904
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
MOTHER.

2905
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
AND WAS PULLED OUT OF THE HIGH

2906
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,000
SCHOOL AND HOME SCHOOLED AND

2907
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
WE KNOW HE STRUGGLED WITH THE

2908
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,000
SCHOOL SYSTEM AND WE DON'T

2909
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
KNOW WHY, A BATTLE BACK AND

2910
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,000
FORTH BETWEEN THE SCHOOL

2911
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000

02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECT BY THIS

2925
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
ENORMOUS TRAGEDY AND TRYING TO

2926
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,000
FIND ANSWERS THAT WE CAN.

2927
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
>> Dave: THEY HAD BEEN

2928
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
DIVORCED FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS
NOW AND THE MOTHER REPORTEDLY

2929
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,000
STRUGGLED MIGHTILY WITH THAT

2930
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
DIVORCE, BUT SHE WAS THE ONE

2931
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
RAISING THIS 20-YEAR-OLD THERE

2932
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000

HE ALSO HAD AN OLDER BROTHER,

LINE ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO.

2938
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
WHY?

2939
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
AGAIN, ANOTHER QUESTION THAT

2940
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
CERTAINLY WILL COME OUT IN A

2941
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
COUPLE OF DAYS, BUT TODAY THE

2954
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,000
TO LOOK AT IN NEWTOWN IS THE

THIS TERRIBLE CRIME EVEN

2967
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:29,000
HARDER TO HANDSEL.

2968
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:34,000
>> THEY WERE FIRST GRADERS,

2969
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,000
INTO KID STUFF.

2970
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,000
THE KIND OF STUFF YOU'D SEND

2972
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,000

FIGURE OUT WHO ADAM LANZA KNEW

2977
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
AND WE DID HEAR FROM ADAM

YESTERDAY WHO TOLD US THAT HIS

02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
MOTHER NANCY KEPT A LOT OF

2981
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,000
GUNS IN THE HOUSE FOR

2982
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
SELF-DEFENSE.

2983
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
>> AND FOR SELF-DEFENSE, NO

2984
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,000
OTHER REASON.

2985
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,000
THEY WERE NOT A VIOLENT

2986
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
FAMILY.
THEY WERE NOT ONE TO, YOU

2987
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:14,000
KNOW, SHE HAD IT DEFINITELY

2988
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR

2989
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
SELF-DEFENSE BECAUSE SHE DID

2990
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
LIVE ALONE.

2991
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,000

THOSE FAMILIES AFFECTED BY

3002
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,000
THIS TRAGEDY HAS BEEN

3003
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,000
TREMENDOUS, BUT FROM WHAT WE

3004
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,000
CAN TELL SO FAR, IT'S REALLY

3005
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
NOT MAKING PEOPLE FEEL ANY

3006
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
BETTER JUST YET.

3007
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,000
BACK TO YOU IN NEW YORK.

3008
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,000

02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
AND SO MUCH IS GOING ON IN

3011
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,000
THIS COMMUNITY AND WE'RE

3012
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
FINDING IS ACTUALLY BRINGING

3013
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
ITSELF TOGETHER.
AND IT HAS TO IN ORDER TO MOVE

3014
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,000
FORWARD.

3015
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000

DESCRIBE CONNECTICUT?

3018
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
WHAT KIND OF PLACE?
>> WELL, I MEAN, NEWTOWN

3019
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
CONNECTICUT IS YOU KNOW, THIS

3020
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:08,000
VERY PRECIOUS, BEAUTIFUL

3021
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
LITTLE NEW ENGLAND TOWN.

3022
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,000
I SPENT A CHRISTMAS EVE GOING

3023
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
TO A MIDNIGHT MASS THERE ONE

3024
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:16,000
TIME WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER AND

3025
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:19,000
HAD BEEN AN INTELABLE IMAGE

3026
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:22,000
FOR ME SINCE IN MY LIFE.

3027
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
IT WAS CHARMING AND BEAUTIFUL

3028
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
AND TWINKLING AND CHURCH

3029
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
BELLS, IT'S THAT KIND OF TOWN.

3030
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
>> Dave: WELL, AND CONNECTICUT

3031
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,000
TO GIVE YOU INSIGHT, PEOPLE

3032
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
THINK OF THE EAST COAST AND

3033
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
THINK OF NEW YORK AND

3034
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
PHILADELPHIA AND BOSTON AND

3035
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
CONNECTICUT IS MADE UP OF

3036
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,000
TOWNS LIKE NEWTOWN,

3037
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
CONNECTICUT.

3038
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:41,000
IT'S ALMOST ENTIRELY, 10, 20,

3039
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:44,000
30,000 PERSON TOWNS LIKE THE

3040
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
ONES THAT ALISYN AND I BOTH

3041
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,000
LIVE IN.

3042
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
AND MANY ACROSS THE STATE AND

3043
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
WHAT IT'S MADE UP OF.

3044
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
AND WHY WE FEEL IT COULD BE

3045
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
ANYONE.

3046
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
>> Kelly: AND THE CULTURE

3047
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
THERE, KNOWING YOUR NEIGHBOR

3048
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:00,000
AND SPEAKING OF CULTURE AND

3049
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
MIKE HUCKABEE WHO IS A DEAR

3050
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,000
FRIEND OF OURS AND HAS HIS OWN

3051
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
PROGRAM ON THIS NETWORK, MIKE

3052
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ROLE OF

3053
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
GOD IN OUR SOCIETY AS RELATES

3054
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
TO OUR CULTURE.

3055
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT MIKE WAS

3056
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
TALKING ABOUT ON "FOX &

3057
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
FRIENDS" HERE YESTERDAY.

3058
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
>> YESTERDAY, I WAS ON NEIL

3059
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
CAVUTO AND HE ASKED ME WHERE

3060
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
WAS GOD AND I SAID WE'VE

3061
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
SYSTEMATICALLY REMOVED HIM

3062
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:26,000
FROM OUR CULTURE AND SCHOOLS,

3063
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
AND I'VE BEEN BARRAGED BY

3064
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
PEOPLE WHO SAID IF WE HAVE

3065
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
PRAYER IN SCHOOLS THIS WOULD

3066
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
NOT HAPPEN.

3067
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
THAT'S NOT MY POINT.
IF WE AS A CULTURE DECIDED

3068
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE

3069
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
VALUES THAT WE DON'T WANT TO

3070
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
SAY THAT SOME THINGS ARE

3071
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
ALWAYS RIGHT, SOME THINGS ARE

3072
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
ALWAYS WRONG WHEN WE DIVORCE

3073
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
OURSELVES FROM A BASIC SENSE

3074
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:45,000
OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL, I WOULD

3075
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
SAY, COLLECTIVE MORALITY WHERE

3076
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
WE AGREE ON CERTAIN PRINCIPLES

3077
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
TO BE TRUE ALWAYS, THEN WE, WE

3078
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,000
CREATE A CULTURE, NOT THAT IT

3079
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
SPECIFICALLY CREATES THIS

3080
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,000
CRIME, IT DOESN'T.

3081
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
BUT IT CREATES AN ATMOSPHERE

3082
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
IN WHICH EVIL AND VIOLENCE ARE

3083
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:03,000
REMOVED FROM OUR SENSE OF

3084
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,000
RESPONSIBILITY.
>> Kelly: CAN I JUST ADD

3085
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
QUICKLY TO THAT.

3086
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
AT THE EXPENSE OF BEING

3087
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
BARRAGED, I UNDERSTAND WHAT

3088
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,000
MIKE IS TALKING ABOUT HERE,

3089
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
WE'RE CUT THE SAME CLOTH HERE.

3090
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000

02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:21,000
GAMES AND PERHAPS FROM THAT

3453
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
GATHER TRAINING AND SOME SORT

3454
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:24,000
OF--
>> ABSOLUTELY, THESE ARE POINT

3455
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
AND SHOOT VIDEO GAMES WHICH

3456
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:27,000
REHEARSE THE ACTION OF

3457
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:28,000
SHOOTING AND KILLING.

3458
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:29,000
YOU MENTALLY REHEARSE THE

3459
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:30,000
ACTION OF SHOOTING YOUR

3460
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
VICTIMS, SHOOT THEM IN THE

3461
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
HEAD, SHOOT THEM ALL TWICE AND

3462
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:37,000
WE CAN IDENTIFY THE VIDEO GAME

3463
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:38,000
THAT THE KID PLAYED IN ORDER

3464
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
TO DOUBLE TAP THE VICTIMS EACH

3465
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,000
AND MAKE THEM DEAD, BUT IT

3466
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,000
DOESN'T TAKE A LOT OF SKILL TO

3467
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:45,000
WALK UP TO A CHILD AND SHOVE A

3468
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:46,000
GUN IN THEIR FACE AND BLOW

3469
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:49,000
THEIR BRAINS OUT WHAT IT TAKES

3470
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
IS DESENSITIZATION AND

3471
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
CONDITIONING TO DO IT AGAIN

3472
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:54,000
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN, TO DO IT

3473
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,000
IN JONESBORO, COLUMBINE AND

3474
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:56,000
VIRGINIA TECH WHAT, DO THEY

3475
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:59,000
HAVE IN COMMON, THEY DROP DOWN

3476
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
AND IMMERSE IN THE SICKEST

3477
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:02,000
MOVIES AND SICKEST VIDEO GAMES

3478
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
AND GUYS, NEVER FORGET I TOLD

3479
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:05,000
YOU, THIS IS JUST THE

3480
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:06,000
BEGINNING.

3481
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
WE HAVE RAISED A GENERATION OF

3482
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
CHILDREN WHO HAVE LEARNED TO

3483
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,000
KILL AND LEARNED TO LIKE IT.

3484
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
AND WHEN WE GET A SICK KID IN

3485
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
PAST YEARS THEY WERE CHEWING

3486
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
GUM AND TALKING OUT IN CLASS.

3487
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,000
NOW WE CREATED SICK KIDS AND

3488
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
THEY'RE GOING TO COME KILL

3489
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:22,000
YOU.

3490
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
IF YOU'RE THE PARENTS WHO LET
THE KIDS PLAY THE SICK GAMES,

3491
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:25,000
THE BLOODS IS ON YOUR HAND AND

3492
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
BY THE WAY YOU MIGHT BE THE

3493
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
FIRST TO DIE AS WHAT HAPPENED

3494
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
HERE.
>> Kelly: COLONEL, IT'S VERY

3495
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
SOBERING WHAT YOU MENTIONED

3496
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:36,000
AND SOBERING THOUGHTS AND

3497
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:39,000

02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,000
MAY DISAGREE.

3500
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:43,000
BUT TAKE IT TO HEART AND THERE

3501
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
ARE SO MANY THINGS WE HAVE TO

3502
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:46,000
DISCUSS, MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES,

3503
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,000
FAITH ISSUES, CULTURE ISSUES

3504
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:50,000
AND EVEN THE ISSUES OF VIDEO

3505
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,000
GAMES THAT TEACH CHILDREN TO

3506
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:54,000
BE DESENSITIZED AND THAT'S

JUXTAPOSED WITH THE AGES,

3537
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:12,000
DIFFICULT TO SEE THE NAMES AND

3538
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:13,000
FAR MORE DIFFICULT WHEN YOU

3539
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
SEE SOME OF THE PICTURES WE'RE

SIX OR SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY AND

HOW DIFFICULT THIS MUST BE FOR

3544
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
THE PARENTS AND EDUCATORS

LOOK FORWARD TO AND SADLY,

3549
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:31,000
THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

3550
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:35,000
SO, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

3551
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
SITUATION YOU'RE ALSO LOOKING

3552
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:38,000
AT THE TEACHERS AS WELL AND

3553
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:39,000
THE ROLE THEY PLAYED IN

3554
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
PROTECTING A LOT OF THEIR

3555
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:42,000
STUDENTS WITH THEIR OWN LIVES

DEDICATED TO EDUCATION, THIS

3560
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
WAS, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY, A

3561
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
TEACHERS'S TEACHER, A

3562
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
PRINCIPAL OF PRINCIPALS WHO

3563
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
REALLY CARED SO DEEPLY, NOT

3564
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:00,000
ONLY FOR HER STUDENTS AND

3565
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
FELLOW TEACHERS, BUT HER

3566
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,000
COMMUNITY.

3567
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:04,000

3568
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,000
TWITTER STREAM AND

3569
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:06,000
COMMUNICATED WITH THE PARENTS

3570
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
AND KIDS AND ONE AUGUST 24TH

3571
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:09,000
OF THIS YEAR, THE FIRST DAY OF

3572
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
SCHOOL SHE SAID, WELCOMING OUR

3573
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
KINDERGARTENERS THIS MORNING,

3574
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
74 NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO

3575
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:18,000
INSPIRE LIFE-LONG LEARNING.

3576
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
WE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK WITH

3577
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:24,000
ONE OF OTHER CLOSE FRIENDS.

3578
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:29,000
>> Dave: DAWN HOCHSPRUNG WE'RE

3579
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
TALKING ABOUT AND SHE WENT TO

3580
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:34,000
THE SHOOTER TO PROTECT HER

3581
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:35,000
STUDENTS AND BEFORE THAT, DAWN

3582
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:38,000
WAS ONE THAT WANTED TO UPGRADE

3583
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,000
THE SECURITY SYSTEM AT THAT

3584
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
SCHOOL AND IMAGINED A

3585
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:46,000
SITUATION EERILY SIMILAR TO

3586
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
WHAT UNFOLDED AND PREPARE

3587
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
HERSELF FOR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

3588
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,000
AND SHE WAS THE ONE WHO WOULD

3589
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:54,000
CONFRONT A SHOOTER.

3590
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
AND WE SPOKE TO ONE OF HER

3591
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:59,000
CLOSE FRIENDS IN WOODBURY,

02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:00,000
CONNECTICUT, GERALD, ABOUT HIS

3593
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,000
CLOSE FRIEND ABOUT A CARING

3594
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
AND DEDICATED EDUCATOR.

3595
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
>> SHE KNEW THAT THE HEALTH

3596
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
AND SAFETY OF HER CHILDREN

3597
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:08,000
WERE ABSOLUTELY PARAMOUNT.

3598
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,000
I THINK THAT WE, THE THING

3599
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
THAT WE NEED TO COME AWAY FROM

3600
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
THIS IS THE FACT THAT SHE

3601
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
ACTUALLY SAVED A GREAT MANY

3602
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:16,000
LIVES AND TAKING THE ACTIONS

3603
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:17,000
THAT SHE DID.

3604
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
THIS SHOOTER HAD THE

3605
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:20,000
CAPABILITY OF KILLING MUCH

3606
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,000
MORE.

3607
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:22,000
THIS TRAGEDY WOULD HAVE BEEN

3608
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
FAR WORSE IF IT WASN'T FOR HER

3609
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
HEROIC ACTIONS.

3610
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,000
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE TYPES

3611
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:28,000
OF THINGS IN OUR WILDEST

3612
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:29,000
DREAMS, DID WE EVER THINK THAT

3613
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:30,000
THE REALITY OF THIS

3614
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
CONVERSATION THAT HER AND I

3615
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
HAD WOULD ACTUALLY UNFOLDED

3616
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,000
INTO REALITY AND THEN CAUSING

3617
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:36,000
THE LOSS OF HER LIFE?

3618
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
SHE IS TRULY A HERO TODAY.

3619
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:39,000
>> Dave: SHE'S ALSO SOMEONE

3620
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:40,000
WHO WANTED TO HAVE A LOT OF

3621
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
FUN THERE IN SCHOOL.

3622
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:43,000
SHE STARTED WHACKY WEDNESDAYS

3623
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:46,000
WHERE THE THE KIDS WOULD WEAR

3624
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
MISMATCHED CLOTHING ALTHOUGH

3625
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:49,000
MANY OF OUR KIDS DO THAT EVERY

3626
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:50,000
DAY.

3627
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:51,000
AND SHE WANTED EVERYONE TO

3628
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
WEAR MISMATCHED CLOTHING ON

3629
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:54,000
WEDNESDAYS AND SHE EVEN

3630
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
PARTICIPATED AND I'M SURE

3631
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:01,000
THAT'S A TRADITION THAT NEVER

3632
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,000
WENT AWAY AT SANDY HOOK.

3633
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:05,000
>> Alisyn: SHE WAS BELOVED.

3634
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:08,000
AND THE KIDS WHO THANKFULLY

3635
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:09,000

3636
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:12,000
HOW DO THEY GO ABOUT TELLING

3637
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:13,000
THEIR CHILDREN THAT THE

3638
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:14,000
PRINCIPAL IS GONE.

3639
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
ONE MOTHER OF A FOURTH GRADER

3640
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:17,000

3641
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000

THE SCHOOL FOR ME IS DEAD AND

3649
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
I THINK IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE

3650
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
THE SAME.

3651
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000

INSIDE A PLACE THEY ONCE

3659
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:51,000

BEEN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

4213
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:03,000

THEY WERE FIRST GRADERS WEARING

4238
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:02,000
CUTE KID STUFF.

4239
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:05,000
IT WAS THE KIND OF STUFF YOU

4240
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:06,000
WOULD SEND YOUR KIDS OR

4241
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:09,000

4242
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:10,000

>> NOW, WE'RE HEARING THAT

4244
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT

4245
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:14,000
AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

4246
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:18,000

GUN RETAILERS AND SHOOTING

4251
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:31,000
RANGES, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO

4252
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
ADAM LANZA KNEW AND IF HE LEFT

4253
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:34,000
CLUES BEFORE FRIDAY ABOUT WHAT

4254
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,000
WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

4255
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
WE DID HEAR YESTERDAY FROM ADAM

MURDERER KEPT SO MANY GUNS.

4260
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
>> THEY WERE NOT A VIOLENT

4261
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:57,000
FAMILY.
IF SHE HAD IT, IT WAS HAVE BEEN

4262
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:00,000
FOR SELF-DEFENSE BECAUSE SHE DID

4263
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:01,000
LIVE ALONE.

4264
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,000
>> 26 CHRISTMAS TREES WERE

4265
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:04,000
DONATED TODAY BY AN ANONYMOUS

4266
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:07,000
PERSON IN NORTH CAROLINA.

4267
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:08,000
THEY'RE BEING SET UP NOT FAR

4268
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL THIS

4269
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:11,000
MORNING.

4270
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,000
THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE

4271
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
NATIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE VICTIMS
OF THIS CRIME.

4272
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:16,000
LOCALLY JUST ACROSS THE STREET,

4273
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000
YESTERDAY WE VISITED WITH A

4274
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:21,000
GROUP OF STUDENTS FROM SANDY

4275
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:22,000
HOOK WHO ESCAPED THE SCHOOL AND

4276
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,000
YOU ARE LUCKY TO TO BE ALIVE.

4277
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:26,000
THEY WERE HOLDING A YARD SALE

4278
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
SELLING TOYS, THEIR OWN TOYS, TO

4279
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,000
RAISE MONEY FOR THE AFFECTED

4280
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:31,000
FAMILIES FOR CLASSMATES AND

4281
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:32,000
NEIGHBORS.

4282
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:36,000
THIS IS A TOWN THAT'S COMPLETELY

4283
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:38,000
HEARTBROKEN AND IT'S TOUGH TO

4284
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,000
TELL HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE FOR

4285
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:41,000
PEOPLE TO FEEL BETTER BUT IT'S

4286
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
GOING TO BE A VERY, VERY LONG

4287
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:44,000
TIME.

4288
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:45,000
BACK TO YOU.

4289
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:48,000
>> PETER, JUST TO REPEAT THAT

4290
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:49,000
POINT, YOU SAID THAT SURVIVORS,

4291
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:51,000
THE KIDS, WERE SELLING THEIR OWN

4292
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:54,000
TOYS TO TRY TO HELP THE FAMILIES

4293
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:57,000
AFFECTED BY THIS?

4294
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:58,000
>> THEY ARE.

4295
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
WE ACTUALLY VISITED YESTERDAY --

4296
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
WE WERE DRIVING BY AND SAW A

4297
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
YARD SALE, TWO YOUNG KIDS THAT

4298
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
LOOKED LIKE THE AGE OF SOME

4299
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:08,000
SANDY HOOK STUDENTS.

4300
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:11,000
WE STOPPED AND APPARENTLY -- WE

4301
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:12,000
TALKED TO THE MOTHER AND SHE

4302
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
SAID EVERY YEAR THEY TRY TO DO

4303
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
SOMETHING FOR CHARITY WITH THE

4304
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,000
PROCEEDS FROM YARD SALES, AN

4305
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,000
ANNUAL FAMILY YARD SALE AND THEY

4306
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:21,000
WERE GOING TO CALL IT OFF

4307
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:23,000
SATURDAY BECAUSE THE WHOLE AREA

4308
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:24,000
IS SO DEVASTATED.

4309
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:28,000
YOU DRIVE AROUND AND YOU'LL SEE

4310
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,000
A STATE TROOPER STATIONED

4311
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:31,000
OUTSIDE SOMEONE'S HOUSE FOR

4312
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,000
HOURS AT A TIME AND YOU KNOW

4313
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:36,000
THAT MEANS THAT IS A HOUSE WHERE

4314
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
A CHILD WHO DID NOT COME HOME

4315
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:40,000
FROM SCHOOL ON FRIDAY LIVED.

4316
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:43,000
AND THEN JUST A FEW STREETS

4317
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
OVER, THESE KIDS DECIDED THAT

4318
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:47,000
THEY CONVINCED THEIR MOM THEY

4319
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:50,000
WANTED TO HAVE THE YARD SALE TO

4320
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:53,000
SUPPORT THOSE FAMILIES OF THEIR

4321
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
CLASSMATES.
AND THEY WERE OUT THERE SELLING

4322
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:56,000
THEIR TOYS.
>> WOW.

4323
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:57,000

BEST WAYS TO GET YOUR KIDS

4334
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:25,000
MOVING FORWARD IS TURN THEIR

03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,000
GRIEF INTO ACTION AND HAVE THEM

4336
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:28,000
DO COMMUNITY SERVICE.

THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT.

4339
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:31,000
IT BRINGS IT HOME.

THESE CHILDREN ARE STEPPING

4341
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:34,000

4356
03:06:58,000 --> 03:06:59,000
ON FRIDAY.

4357
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
HE SPOKE OUT ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER

4358
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,000
ON SATURDAY AND SAID SOMETHING

4359
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:04,000
THAT SURPRISED US AND MAY

4360
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:06,000
SURPRISE ALL OF YOU.

4361
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:09,000
HE STRUCK A TONE OF FORGIVENESS

4362
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:11,000
EVEN FOR THE SHOOTER'S FAMILY.

4363
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:13,000
LISTEN TO WHAT ROBBY PARKER HAD

4364
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:14,000
TO SAY.

4365
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
>> FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO

4366
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:19,000
OFFER OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO

4367
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
ALL THE FAMILIES WHO WERE

4368
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:24,000
DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THIS

4369
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:25,000
SHOOTING.

4370
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:29,000
IT'S A HORRIFIC TRAGEDY AND OUR

4371
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:30,000
HEARTS AND PRAYERS GO OUT TO

4372
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:31,000
THEM.

4373
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:35,000
THIS INCLUDES THE FAMILY OF THE

4374
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:38,000
SHOOTER.
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD THIS

4375
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:40,000
EXPERIENCE MUST BE FOR YOU.

4376
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:44,000
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR

4377
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:47,000
FAMILY AND OUR LOVE AND SUPPORT

4378
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:50,000
GO OUT TO YOU.
MY DAUGHTER, EMILIE, WOULD BE

4379
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,000
ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE

4380
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:53,000
STANDING AND GIVING HER LOVE AND

4381
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:56,000
SUPPORT TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS

4382
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:57,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF

4383
03:07:57,000 --> 03:08:00,000
PERSON THAT SHE IS.

4384
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:02,000
NOT BECAUSE OF ANY PARENTING

4385
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:04,000
THAT MY WIFE AND I COULD HAVE

4386
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,000
DONE BUT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE

4387
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,000
GIFTS GIVEN TO HER BY HER

4388
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:09,000
HEAVENLY FATHER.

03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:06,000
OF LOSS AND IT'S SIGNED BY LYNN

4419
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:11,000
AND CHRIS AND HER PARENTS, AND

4420
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:12,000

03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:18,000
STATEMENTS WERE MADE ABOUT HER

4424
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:20,000
HEROISM AND HOW MUCH SHE LOVED

4425
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:22,000
HER STUDENTS AND EVEN SACRIFICED

4426
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:25,000
HER OWN LIFE FOR HER STUDENTS BY

4427
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:26,000
SHIELDING THEM FROM THE GUNMAN

4428
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:28,000
AFTER SHE WAS CONFRONTED.

4429
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:30,000
APPARENTLY SHE HEARD WHAT WAS

4430
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:31,000
GOING ON.

4431
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
THERE ARE REPORTS SHE PERHAPS

4432
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:37,000
HID THE CHILDREN IN A CUPBOARD

4433
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:40,000
AND WHEN THE GUNMAN CONFRONTED

4434
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:43,000
HER, SHE TOLD HIM THEY WERE NOT

4435
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:44,000
THERE.
THERE ARE OTHER REPORTS SHE SAW

4436
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:47,000
HIM AND SHIELDED THE CHILDREN.

4437
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:48,000
INCREDIBLE MOMENTS OF HEROISM.

4438
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:50,000
YOU LOOK AT ROBBY PARKER AND

4439
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:54,000
THAT CAPACITY TO FORGIVE, HAVING

4440
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:57,000
COMPASSION ON THE KILLER AND HIS

4441
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:59,000
FAMILY AT A TIME WHEN HE'S

4442
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:01,000
GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS OWN

4443
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:02,000
DAUGHTER.

4444
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:03,000
>> I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE,

4445
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:06,000
THEIR INITIAL REACTION IS SO

4446
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:08,000
BLAME THE PARENTS AND SAY HOW

4447
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:10,000
DID THEY MISS THE WARNING SIGNS

4448
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:12,000
AND ALLOW ACCESS TO WEAPONS TO A

4449
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:15,000
YOUNG KID WHO IS CLEARLY

4450
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:16,000
TROUBLED.
TO HAVE FORGIVENESS IS

4451
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:21,000
UNMANAGEABLE TO ME, BUT

4452
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:25,000
ADMIRABLE.

4453
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:27,000
ROBBY PARKER SHARED THE LAST

4454
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:29,000
MEMORIES HE HAD WITH HIS

4455
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:30,000
6-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

4456
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:32,000
>> SHE WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT AND

4457
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:34,000
I HAD BEEN TEACHING HER

4458
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:35,000
PORTUGUESE, SO HER LAST

4459
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:39,000
CONVERSATION WAS IN PORTUGUESE

4460
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:42,000
AND SHE -- SHE TOLD ME GOOD

4461
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:45,000
MORNING AND ASKED HOW I WAS

4462
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:47,000
DOING.
I SAID I WAS DOING WELL.

4463
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:49,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME AND I

4464
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:51,000
GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT

4465
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:52,000
THE DOOR.

4466
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:53,000
>> IT'S WONDERFUL TO HEAR FROM

4467
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:55,000
HIM.
HE'S AN INSPIRATION OBVIOUSLY.

4468
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:57,000
DAVE, YOU'RE RIGHT, PARTICULARLY

4469
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:59,000
AT THIS HOUR, TO HAVE

4470
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:02,000
FORGIVENESS.
A LOT OF PEOPLE WORK AROUND TO

4471
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:07,000
IT WITH A BIG HEART AND MAGNANMY

4472
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:12,000
BUT FOR HIM TO HAVE IT IN 24

4473
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:13,000
HOURS IS INCREDIBLE.

4474
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:15,000
HE'S ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT

4475
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:17,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING AND

4476
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:20,000

FOR PARENTS WHO LOST THEIR

4535
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:35,000
CHILDREN AND HOW DEVASTATED THEY

4536
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:36,000
WERE GOING TO BE.

4537
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:38,000
ALSO IT JUST -- IT ALSO JUST

4538
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:40,000
MADE ME THINK ABOUT KIND OF

4539
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:42,000
WHERE MY GENERATION IS AS FAR AS

4540
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:45,000
WHAT OUR VALUES ARE AND EVEN THE

4541
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:47,000
SPIRITUAL CONDITION OF OUR

4542
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:49,000
GENERATION.
BECAUSE I LOOK AT THE LAST FEW

4543
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:51,000
SHOOTINGS THAT HAPPENED ALL FROM

4544
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:54,000
GUYS IN THEIR 20s, AND IT MADE

4545
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:56,000
ME ANGRY.

4546
03:15:56,000 --> 03:15:57,000
>> CRAIG, I WAS THERE FOR THE

4547
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:59,000
WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED AT COLUMBINE

4548
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:02,000
AS WELL BEING FROM DENVER, I

4549
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:03,000
UNFORTUNATELY COVERED THAT.

4550
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:05,000
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID

4551
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:07,000
ABOUT YOUR GENERATION AND

4552
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:09,000
VALUES.
WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE?

4553
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:11,000
WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO PEOPLE

4554
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:14,000
IN THEIR LATE TEENS, EARLY

4555
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:16,000
20s?
WHAT DOES NEED TO CHANGE IN

4556
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:17,000
TERMS OF PRIORITIES AND VALUES

4557
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:18,000
TODAY?

4558
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:20,000
>> EVERY WEEK I'M ALL ACROSS THE

4559
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:22,000
COUNTRY SPENDING TIME WITH

4560
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:24,000
TEENAGERS AND PEOPLE IN THEIR

4561
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:26,000
20s AT COLLEGES.

4562
03:16:26,000 --> 03:16:31,000
AND I THINK THAT WE -- AS A

4563
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:33,000
GENERATION, HAVE TO ASK

4564
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:34,000
OURSELVES AS AMERICANS WHAT DO

4565
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:37,000
WE STAND FOR, WHAT DO WE BELIEVE

4566
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:41,000
IN?
BECAUSE THERE'S A WAR CULTURALLY

4567
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:43,000
IN OUR HEARTS GOING ON TODAY I

4568
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:46,000
THINK.
THERE'S A LOT OF DARK THINGS

4569
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:49,000
THAT I THINK THESE SHOOTERS AND

4570
03:16:49,000 --> 03:16:52,000
OTHER PEOPLE ARE TAPPING INTO.

4571
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:54,000
SO MUCH VIOLENCE THROUGH THE

4572
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:56,000
MEDIA AND DARK STUFF OVER THE

4573
03:16:56,000 --> 03:16:59,000
INTERNET THAT THEY'RE INFLUENCED

4574
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:02,000
BY LIVING THAT ONLINE LIFESTYLE.

4575
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:05,000
I JUST THINK WHERE IS THE

4576
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:06,000
RESPECT FOR LIFE, THE SANCTITY

4577
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:07,000
OF LIFE?

4578
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:10,000
I KNOW THAT WHEN I TRAVEL AROUND

4579
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:12,000
AND MEET SO MANY TEENAGERS THAT

4580
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:14,000
WHETHER IT'S AT HOME OR AT

4581
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:16,000
SCHOOL, THEY'RE NOT -- THEY'RE

4582
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:19,000
NOT GROWING UP IN A CULTURE

4583
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:21,000
WHERE THEY LEARN ABOUT WHAT ARE

4584
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:24,000
THE VALUES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

4585
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:25,000
HOLD ONTO THAT ARE IMPORTANT.

4586
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:28,000
AND I THINK ABOUT THIS -- MY

4587
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:30,000
FATHER'S GENERATION, I KNOW THAT

4588
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:33,000
NO ONE IN HIS GENERATION WOULD

4589
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:34,000
HAVE DREAMED OF GOING INTO A

4590
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:37,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASS AND KILLING

4591
03:17:37,000 --> 03:17:38,000
EVERY KINDERGARTENER UNLESS THEY

4592
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:40,000
WERE ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.

4593
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:42,000
THESE AREN'T CRAZY PEOPLE.

4594
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:46,000
THEY'RE -- THEY CAN THINK AND

4595
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:50,000
RATIONALIZE LOGICALLY, WEATHER

4596
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:51,000
THE SHOOTING AT THE THEATER OR

4597
03:17:51,000 --> 03:17:52,000
THIS ONE THAT HAPPENED.

4598
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:56,000
SO I THINK THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A

4599
03:17:56,000 --> 03:18:00,000
CULTURE WHERE, IF MY GENERATION

4600
03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:01,000
EMBRACES CERTAIN VALUES AND

4601
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:03,000
THINGS SPIRITUALLY, IT'S GOING

4602
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:06,000
TO BE LIKE A LIGHT AND -- AND

4603
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:09,000
THERE'S A LOT OF DARKNESS RIGHT

4604
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:11,000
NOW AND -- IN OUR CULTURE, IN

4605
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:13,000
OUR GENERATION.

4606
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:14,000
THOSE ARE SYMPTOM OF THE

4607
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:17,000
I THINK -- SOME OF THE THINGS I

4608
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:18,000
THINK ABOUT.

4609
03:18:18,000 --> 03:18:20,000
>> WE TALKED TO YOUR MOM

4610
03:18:20,000 --> 03:18:24,000
YESTERDAY.
SHE'S SO INSPIRATIONAL.

4611
03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:25,000
SHE SAID THE PARENTS WILL SOME

4612
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:28,000
DAY, SOMEHOW, GET PAST THEIR

4613
03:18:28,000 --> 03:18:30,000
GRIEF.
SHE TALKED ABOUT IT WILL TAKE A

4614
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:31,000
LONG TIME BUT SOME DAY YOU WILL

4615
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:33,000
BE ABLE TO SMILE AGAIN.

4616
03:18:33,000 --> 03:18:34,000
ONE THING SHE SAID THAT STUCK

4617
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:36,000
WITH ME IS SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE

4618
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:39,000
GOING TO BE A CASUALTY TOO.

4619
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:42,000
NOT LITERALLY BUT FIGURATIVELY.

4620
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:43,000
THERE WERE TWO YEARS THAT YOU

4621
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:47,000
WERE SO GRIEF-STRICKEN THAT SHE

4622
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:48,000
THOUGHT YOU WERE LOST.

4623
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:50,000
HOW DID YOU TURN IT AROUND

4624
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:51,000
PERSONALLY?

4625
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:52,000
>> I WENT THROUGH A LOT OF

4626
03:18:52,000 --> 03:18:53,000
DEPRESSION AND ANGER AFTER THE

4627
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:54,000
SHOOTING.

4628
03:18:54,000 --> 03:18:56,000
I HATED THE TWO SHOOTERS.

4629
03:18:56,000 --> 03:18:59,000
I USED TO CARRY THAT ANGER WITH

4630
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:00,000
ME, ANYTIME SOMEONE TALKED ABOUT

4631
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:01,000
THEM OR THOUGHT ABOUT THEM, IT

4632
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:04,000
WAS LIKE A BLACK CLOUD ENVELOPED

4633
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:06,000
ME AND I STARTED TO TAKE IT OUT

4634
03:19:06,000 --> 03:19:07,000
ON PEOPLE I WAS CLOSE WITH.

4635
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:10,000
AND IT TOOK TIME, BUT I

4636
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:13,000
EVENTUALLY FOUND THAT THE WAY TO

4637
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:16,000
NOT HOLD ON TO THAT WAS TO

4638
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:18,000
FORGIVE AND LET GO.

4639
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:21,000
AND A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE DON'T

4640
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:22,000
UNDERSTAND FORGIVENESS AND

4641
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:23,000
THINKING IT'S SAYING WHAT

4642
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:24,000
SOMEONE DID IS OKAY.

4643
03:19:24,000 --> 03:19:25,000
IT WASN'T THAT.

4644
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:28,000
IT WAS LETTING GO OF THE RIGHT

4645
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:31,000
TO HATE.
I JUST KNEW THAT FOR ME, I

4646
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:32,000
DIDN'T WANT TO BE A BITTER

4647
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:34,000
PERSON DOWN THE ROAD.

4648
03:19:34,000 --> 03:19:36,000
AND I THINK THAT WITH THE PEOPLE

4649
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:39,000
IN THIS COMMUNITY, WHO HAVE A

4650
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:42,000
RIGHT TO BE ANGRY AT WHAT HAS

4651
03:19:42,000 --> 03:19:44,000
HAPPENED, THAT THEY WILL THINK

4652
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:47,000
ABOUT WHO THEY WANT TO BE DOWN

4653
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:48,000
THE ROAD AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING

4654
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:52,000
TO CHOOSE TO FOCUS ON.

4655
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:54,000
MY -- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

4656
03:19:54,000 --> 03:19:55,000
HELPED ME WAS STICKING TOGETHER

4657
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:59,000
WITH MY FAMILY AND MY FAITH.

4658
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:02,000
IT REALLY HELPED ME HEAL

4659
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:03,000
MENTALLY AND SPIRITUALLY.

4660
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:04,000
>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SPEAKING

4661
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:06,000
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY DO AROUND

4662
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:08,000
THE COUNTRY, RACHEL'S CHALLENGE,

4663
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:10,000
WHICH TRAVELS TO SCHOOLS TO

4664
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:11,000
EDUCATE PARENTS AND KIDS.

4665
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:13,000
YOU TALK ABOUT THE CODE OF

4666
03:20:13,000 --> 03:20:16,000
ETHICS THAT YOUR SISTER WROTE

4667
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:18,000
BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED.

4668
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:21,000
NOT MANY HIGH SCHOOLERS WRITE A

4669
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:22,000
CODE OF ETHICS.

4670
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:24,000
WHAT IS THE MESSAGE THAT YOUR

4671
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:26,000
SISTER WOULD WANT YOU TO

4672
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:28,000
CONTINUE PREACHING ACROSS THE

4673
03:20:28,000 --> 03:20:29,000
COUNTRY?

4674
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:31,000
>> WELL HER MESSAGE WAS TO STEP

4675
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:34,000
OUT OF YOUR WAY IN COMPASSION

4676
03:20:34,000 --> 03:20:36,000
FOR OTHER PEOPLE, TO SHOW

4677
03:20:36,000 --> 03:20:39,000
KINDNESS AND START A CHAIN

4678
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:40,000
REACTION OF KINDNESS AND

4679
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:41,000
COMPASSION.

4680
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:42,000
SHE WENT OUT OF HER WAY FOR

4681
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:44,000
PEOPLE THAT WERE ON THE OUTSIDE,

4682
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:46,000
PEOPLE THAT WERE HURTING.
SHE HAD A HEART FOR THESE

4683
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:47,000
PEOPLE.

4684
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:48,000
THAT'S THE SAME CHALLENGE WE

4685
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:53,000
GIVE TO TEENS AND COLLEGES AND

4686
03:20:55,000 --> 03:20:56,000
EVEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS ACROSS

4687
03:20:56,000 --> 03:20:57,000
THE COUNTRY.

4688
03:20:57,000 --> 03:20:58,000
WE SEE STUDENTS ACCEPT THAT

4689
03:20:58,000 --> 03:21:00,000
CHALLENGE AS THEY HEAR ABOUT A

4690
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:02,000
TEENAGER AND WE PRESENT TO THEM

4691
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:03,000
A ROLE MODEL OF SOMEONE WHO

4692
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:06,000
BELIEVED THAT SHE COULD MAKE A

4693
03:21:06,000 --> 03:21:07,000
DIFFERENCE THROUGH SIMPLE ACTS

4694
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:10,000
OF KINDNESS AND FEELING FOR

4695
03:21:10,000 --> 03:21:11,000
OTHER PEOPLE.

4696
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:12,000
>> WELL, CRAIG SCOTT, YOUR

4697
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:15,000
SISTER AND YOU HAVE BEEN REAL

4698
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:19,000
LIGHTS IN THE DARKNESS OF THESE

4699
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:20,000
TERRIBLE TRAGEDIES.

4700
03:21:20,000 --> 03:21:22,000
IT'S WONDERFUL TO SPEAK TO YOU.

4701
03:21:22,000 --> 03:21:23,000
THANKS FOR BRINGING YOUR

4702
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:24,000
INSPIRATIONAL MESSAGE.

4703
03:21:24,000 --> 03:21:26,000
>> THANK YOU.

4704
03:21:26,000 --> 03:21:27,000

for giving the perfect gift?

4713
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:49,000

03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:56,000
the right...thing.

4716
03:21:56,000 --> 03:21:58,000
How do they do that?

4717
03:21:58,000 --> 03:22:00,000
More saving. More doing.

4718
03:22:00,000 --> 03:22:03,000
That's the power of The
Home Depot.

4719
03:22:03,000 --> 03:22:08,000
Pick up a RIDGID JobMax
multi-tool starter kit and
get a free head attachment.

4720
03:24:56,000 --> 03:24:58,000
>>> WHEN THE TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS

4721
03:24:58,000 --> 03:25:00,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING STRIKE MANY ARE

4722
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:02,000
LEFT TO WONDER WHY IT HAPPENED

4723
03:25:02,000 --> 03:25:04,000
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

4724
03:25:04,000 --> 03:25:06,000
OUR NEXT GUEST SAYS IT'S THE

4725
03:25:06,000 --> 03:25:08,000
CULTURE IN AMERICA.

4726
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:11,000
>> JOINING US, JAMES HEARSTEN.

4727
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:12,000
HI, JAMES.
>> GOOD MORNING.

4728
03:25:12,000 --> 03:25:13,000
>> I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THE

4729
03:25:13,000 --> 03:25:16,000
UNITED STATES HAS HAD MORE

4730
03:25:16,000 --> 03:25:17,000
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THAN ANY OTHER

4731
03:25:17,000 --> 03:25:18,000
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.

4732
03:25:18,000 --> 03:25:22,000
WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR CULTURE?

4733
03:25:22,000 --> 03:25:24,000
>> OUR CONSULT, PARTICULARLY OUR

4734
03:25:24,000 --> 03:25:26,000
POP CONSULT, IS EXTREMELY

4735
03:25:26,000 --> 03:25:27,000
VIOLENT.

4736
03:25:27,000 --> 03:25:29,000
JUST RECENTLY JAMIE FOXX WHO

4737
03:25:29,000 --> 03:25:31,000
SPOKE OUT, HOE HAS A VIOLENT

4738
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:34,000
MOVIE COMING OUT, THAT HOLLYWOOD

4739
03:25:34,000 --> 03:25:35,000
BEARS A RESPONSIBILITY WITH

4740
03:25:35,000 --> 03:25:36,000
THESE KINDS OF EVENTS.

4741
03:25:36,000 --> 03:25:38,000
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

4742
03:25:38,000 --> 03:25:41,000
IS A WHOLE HOST OF MEDIA BUT

4743
03:25:41,000 --> 03:25:43,000
PARTICULARLY VIDEO GAMES.

4744
03:25:43,000 --> 03:25:45,000
BECAUSE VIDEO GAMES ARE

4745
03:25:45,000 --> 03:25:47,000
INTERACTIVE, VIDEO GAMES INVOLVE

4746
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:50,000
ALL THE SENSES OF THE MODALITIES

4747
03:25:50,000 --> 03:25:52,000
OF LEARNING AND THERE'S BEEN A

4748
03:25:52,000 --> 03:25:54,000
RECENT STUDY OUT OF AUSTRALIA

4749
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:59,000
THAT SHOWS VIDEO GAMES ARE

4750
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:02,000
ADDICTIVE AND THERE ARE SOCIAL

4751
03:26:02,000 --> 03:26:04,000
CONSEQUENCES TO IT IS ADDICTION.

4752
03:26:04,000 --> 03:26:05,000
THEY GET INTO A STATE OF

4753
03:26:05,000 --> 03:26:07,000
ISOLATION THAT FEEDS THE

4754
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:10,000
ADDICTION, THEY RETREAT INTO AN

4755
03:26:10,000 --> 03:26:11,000
ONLINE WORLD.

4756
03:26:11,000 --> 03:26:15,000
AND TECHNOLOGY HAS NOW MADE

4757
03:26:15,000 --> 03:26:17,000
VIDEO GAME VIOLENCE MORE

4758
03:26:17,000 --> 03:26:18,000
COMPELLING BECAUSE IT'S

4759
03:26:18,000 --> 03:26:19,000
REALISTIC AND PEOPLE ARE

4760
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:22,000
DESIGNING THESE GAMES TO

4761
03:26:22,000 --> 03:26:24,000
LITERALLY TEACH THE PLAYERS HOW

4762
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:28,000
TO MAIM, HOW TO MURDER, WITH

4763
03:26:28,000 --> 03:26:32,000
GREAT BRUTALITY AND SADISM.

4764
03:26:32,000 --> 03:26:34,000
THE PROBLEM IS PARENTS ARE

4765
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:36,000
SOMETIMES UNAWARE OF THE

4766
03:26:36,000 --> 03:26:38,000
DELIVERY SYSTEMS WITH THE NEW

4767
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:39,000
TECHNOLOGY AND UNAWARE OF THE

4768
03:26:39,000 --> 03:26:41,000
CONTENT OF THIS MATERIAL.

4769
03:26:41,000 --> 03:26:43,000
SO IT'S A GREAT CONCERN.

4770
03:26:43,000 --> 03:26:46,000
BUT THE MEDIA AS A WHOLE IS

4771
03:26:46,000 --> 03:26:49,000
POLLUTED WITH THIS KIND OF

4772
03:26:49,000 --> 03:26:53,000
GRATUITOUS, EXPLICIT, DETAILED,

4773
03:26:53,000 --> 03:26:54,000
GRAPHIC VIOLENCE.

4774
03:26:54,000 --> 03:26:55,000
>> WE WERE TALKING EARLIER IN

4775
03:26:55,000 --> 03:26:58,000
THE SHOW AND DISCUSSED THE FACT

4776
03:26:58,000 --> 03:26:59,000
THERE ARE SOME MEASURES IN

4777
03:26:59,000 --> 03:27:01,000
PLACE, FOR EXAMPLE, WARNING

4778
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:03,000
LABELS ABOUT THE GRAPHIC NATURE

4779
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:05,000
OF THE VIOLENCE AND PARENTS

4780
03:27:05,000 --> 03:27:08,000
SHOULD ACTUALLY MONITOR THEIR

4781
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:09,000
CHILDREN.
IS IT IMPORTANT AT THIS POINT TO

4782
03:27:09,000 --> 03:27:11,000
DRIVE THAT HOME TO PARENTS THAT

4783
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:13,000
THEY SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHAT

4784
03:27:13,000 --> 03:27:14,000
THEIR CHILDREN MIGHT BE GETTING

4785
03:27:14,000 --> 03:27:16,000
INVOLVED IN WITH THE VIDEO GAME

4786
03:27:16,000 --> 03:27:19,000
OR WATCHING ON TELEVISION?

4787
03:27:19,000 --> 03:27:21,000
>> IT IS MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER

4788
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:23,000
IN OUR TIME WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY

4789
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:25,000
THAT PARENTS ARE INFORMED AND

4790
03:27:25,000 --> 03:27:26,000
THAT THEY'RE INVOLVED.

4791
03:27:26,000 --> 03:27:29,000
AS YOU POINT OUT, THERE ARE

4792
03:27:29,000 --> 03:27:32,000
WONDERFUL RATINGS AVAILABLE, THE

4793
03:27:32,000 --> 03:27:33,000
ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE RATINGS

4794
03:27:33,000 --> 03:27:37,000
BOARD FOR VIDEO GAMES IS A

4795
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:38,000
NONPROFIT, SELF-REGULATORY BODY

4796
03:27:38,000 --> 03:27:39,000
THAT RATES THESE.

4797
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:42,000
THE VIOLENCE IS PREVALENT IN

4798
03:27:42,000 --> 03:27:43,000
LYRICS TO SONGS.

4799
03:27:43,000 --> 03:27:45,000
IT'S PREVALENT ON TELEVISION.

4800
03:27:45,000 --> 03:27:46,000
IT'S PREVALENT IN THE MOVIES AND

4801
03:27:46,000 --> 03:27:49,000
VIDEO GAMES AND THEY ALL HAVE

4802
03:27:49,000 --> 03:27:51,000
DIFFERENT RATING SYSTEMS.

4803
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:53,000
IT WILL REALLY HELP IF THERE

4804
03:27:53,000 --> 03:27:55,000
WERE A UNIFORM RATING SYSTEM

4805
03:27:55,000 --> 03:27:59,000
THAT WAS SIMPLE, CLEAR, AND EASY

4806
03:27:59,000 --> 03:28:00,000
TO UNDERSTAND FOR PARENTS AND

4807
03:28:00,000 --> 03:28:01,000
CHILDREN.

4808
03:28:01,000 --> 03:28:03,000

AFTERMATH OF THE LITTLETON

4811

>>> WELCOME BACK TO SUNDAY

5090
03:44:10,000 --> 03:44:11,000
MORNING.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF THE

5091
03:44:11,000 --> 03:44:14,000
MOST JOYOUS TIMES OF THE YEAR

5092
03:44:14,000 --> 03:44:16,000
BUT FAMILIES IN NEWTOWN,

5093
03:44:16,000 --> 03:44:17,000
CONNECTICUT AND AROUND THE

5094
03:44:17,000 --> 03:44:19,000
COUNTRY ARE DEALING WITH THIS

5095
03:44:19,000 --> 03:44:22,000
TRAGEDY.
WITH CHRISTMAS ONE WEEK AWAY,

5096
03:44:22,000 --> 03:44:24,000
HOW DO YOU ARE HE STORE FAITH IN

5097
03:44:24,000 --> 03:44:25,000
GOD?

5098
03:44:25,000 --> 03:44:28,000
>> JOINING US, FATHER JOHNATHAN

5099
03:44:28,000 --> 03:44:30,000
MORRIS.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.

5100
03:44:30,000 --> 03:44:33,000
HAVE YOU BEEN IN TOUCH WITH

5101
03:44:33,000 --> 03:44:34,000
PEOPLE IN NEWTOWN?

5102
03:44:34,000 --> 03:44:36,000
>> I HAVE.
I'M NOT GOING TODAY BECAUSE I

5103
03:44:36,000 --> 03:44:41,000
HAVE MY SERVICES IN NEW YORK

5104
03:44:42,000 --> 03:44:43,000
CITY.
BUT WHEN THINGS CALM DOWN, WHEN

5105
03:44:43,000 --> 03:44:47,000
THE SHOCK BEGINS TO WEAR OFF

5106
03:44:47,000 --> 03:44:50,000
THAT'S WHEN MORE SUPPORT,

5107
03:44:50,000 --> 03:44:51,000
FRIENDSHIP, CLOSENESS NEEDS TO

5108
03:44:51,000 --> 03:44:53,000
BE THERE.

5109
03:44:53,000 --> 03:44:54,000
I AND SO MANY OTHERS WILL BE

5110
03:44:54,000 --> 03:44:55,000
THERE.

5111
03:44:55,000 --> 03:44:56,000
>> WE TALKED ABOUT OUR REACTION

5112
03:44:56,000 --> 03:44:59,000
TO ROBBY PARKER, THE FATHER OF

5113
03:44:59,000 --> 03:45:01,000
YOUNG 6-YEAR-OLD EMILIE PARKER,

5114
03:45:01,000 --> 03:45:03,000
WHO WAS HIS OLDEST DAUGHTER, HE

5115
03:45:03,000 --> 03:45:05,000
HAS THREE.

5116
03:45:05,000 --> 03:45:07,000
WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND HIM

5117
03:45:07,000 --> 03:45:08,000
REACHING OUT TO THE COMMUNITY,

5118
03:45:08,000 --> 03:45:12,000
BUT HE ALSO WENT SO FAR AS TO

5119
03:45:12,000 --> 03:45:15,000
FORGIVE.
EXPLAIN TO ME AND ALL OF US WHY

5120
03:45:15,000 --> 03:45:17,000
FORGIVENESS IS SO ESSENTIAL AND

5121
03:45:17,000 --> 03:45:19,000
WHAT IT SHOWS NOT ONLY IN TERMS

5122
03:45:19,000 --> 03:45:21,000
OF HIS FORGIVENESS BUT GOD'S

5123
03:45:21,000 --> 03:45:22,000
COMPASSION.

5124
03:45:22,000 --> 03:45:24,000
>> I SAW THAT INTERVIEW AND HE

5125
03:45:24,000 --> 03:45:26,000
WAS BLOWN AWAY.

5126
03:45:26,000 --> 03:45:29,000
HIS ABILITY TO FORGIVE IS NOT

5127
03:45:29,000 --> 03:45:32,000
JUST NATURAL VIRTUE, A GOOD GUY.

5128
03:45:32,000 --> 03:45:34,000
BUT HE UNDERSTANDS, HE BELIEVES,

5129
03:45:34,000 --> 03:45:37,000
THAT THERE IS ULTIMATE JUDGE AND

5130
03:45:37,000 --> 03:45:42,000
THAT IS GOD.
HE SAID IN SUCH CLEAR AND

5131
03:45:42,000 --> 03:45:43,000
PROFOUND LANGUAGE WE ALL HAVE

5132
03:45:43,000 --> 03:45:46,000
FREE WILL.

5133
03:45:46,000 --> 03:45:49,000
WE CAN CHOOSE TO USE IT FOR GOOD

5134
03:45:49,000 --> 03:45:50,000
OR BAD.

5135
03:45:50,000 --> 03:45:52,000
THIS YOUNG MAN ABUSED HIS FREE

5136
03:45:52,000 --> 03:45:53,000
WILL.

5137
03:45:53,000 --> 03:45:55,000
THEN HE SAID I'M GOING TO USE MY

5138
03:45:55,000 --> 03:45:56,000
FREE WILL FOR THE GOOD.

5139
03:45:56,000 --> 03:45:57,000
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT PROFOUND

5140
03:45:57,000 --> 03:45:59,000
CONVICTION OF WHO I AM, WHERE I

5141
03:45:59,000 --> 03:46:01,000
HAVE COME FROM, WHERE I'M GOING,

5142
03:46:01,000 --> 03:46:03,000
ULTIMATE JUDGMENT, IT'S EASIER

5143
03:46:03,000 --> 03:46:04,000
TO FORGIVE.

5144
03:46:04,000 --> 03:46:05,000
THAT'S A GIFT.

5145
03:46:05,000 --> 03:46:07,000
IT'S A GIFT OF FAITH.

5146
03:46:07,000 --> 03:46:09,000
AND WE SHOULD BE PRAYING FOR

5147
03:46:09,000 --> 03:46:11,000
EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO DOESN'T

5148
03:46:11,000 --> 03:46:13,000
HAVE THAT IN THESE TOUGH TIMES

5149
03:46:13,000 --> 03:46:14,000
TO GET THAT.

5150
03:46:14,000 --> 03:46:16,000
IT'S A PROFOUND, WONDERFUL

5151
03:46:16,000 --> 03:46:19,000
THING.
>> WHAT IS THE ROLE OF FAITH AND

5152
03:46:19,000 --> 03:46:20,000
HEALING?

5153
03:46:20,000 --> 03:46:23,000
AND MAYBE IN PREVENTING FURTHER

5154
03:46:23,000 --> 03:46:24,000
TRANSLATION AROUND THE COUNTRY?

5155
03:46:24,000 --> 03:46:26,000
>> THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION.

5156
03:46:26,000 --> 03:46:29,000
WE CAN TALK ABOUT, LIKE OUR

5157
03:46:29,000 --> 03:46:34,000
PREVIOUS GUEST, THE CULTURAL

5158
03:46:35,000 --> 03:46:36,000
ISSUES.

5159
03:46:36,000 --> 03:46:37,000
ALL THIS TAKES A PLACE.

5160
03:46:37,000 --> 03:46:40,000
I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR JAMES

5161
03:46:40,000 --> 03:46:43,000
WHO TALKED ABOUT THAT BUT IN THE

5162
03:46:43,000 --> 03:46:45,000
END, NOT ONE SINGLE FACTOR WILL

5163
03:46:45,000 --> 03:46:47,000
PUT SOMEBODY OVER THE EDGE.

5164
03:46:47,000 --> 03:46:49,000
WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S MENTAL

5165
03:46:49,000 --> 03:46:51,000
HEALTH ISSUES, A CULTURE OF

5166
03:46:51,000 --> 03:46:52,000
DEATH, INCLUDING VIDEO GAMES AND

5167
03:46:52,000 --> 03:46:55,000
OTHER THINGS, ALSO WHEN THE SOUL

5168
03:46:55,000 --> 03:46:57,000
GOES DARK, WHEN THE SOUL GOES

5169
03:46:57,000 --> 03:47:00,000
DARK, THAT'S WHEN THOSE OTHER

5170
03:47:00,000 --> 03:47:02,000
FACTORS BEGIN TO ADD UP TO

5171
03:47:02,000 --> 03:47:04,000
SOMETHING TRAGIC LIKE THIS.

5172
03:47:04,000 --> 03:47:08,000
THAT SOUL GOING DARK IN MY

5173
03:47:08,000 --> 03:47:09,000
OPINION IS ONE SOMEONE NO LONGER

5174
03:47:09,000 --> 03:47:11,000
HAS A PURPOSE FOR LIVING.

5175
03:47:11,000 --> 03:47:13,000
WHEN HUMANITY IS NOT WORTH THAT

5176
03:47:13,000 --> 03:47:15,000
MUCH, IF YOU'RE NOT LOVED, YOU

5177
03:47:15,000 --> 03:47:17,000
CANNOT LOVE.

5178
03:47:17,000 --> 03:47:18,000
ULTIMATELY IF YOU DON'T KNOW

5179
03:47:18,000 --> 03:47:20,000
YOU'RE LOVED BY GOD, IN MY

5180
03:47:20,000 --> 03:47:21,000
OPINION, THEN IT'S GOING TO BE

5181
03:47:21,000 --> 03:47:23,000
VERY HARD TO LOVE YOURSELF AND

5182
03:47:23,000 --> 03:47:24,000
OTHER PEOPLE.

5183
03:47:24,000 --> 03:47:25,000
>> THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT

5184
03:47:25,000 --> 03:47:28,000
BECAUSE WHEN YOU READ ABOUT

5185
03:47:28,000 --> 03:47:29,000
UNDERSTANDING PURPOSE AND WHAT

5186
03:47:29,000 --> 03:47:32,000
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS VERY

5187
03:47:32,000 --> 03:47:35,000
KEY, BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

5188
03:47:35,000 --> 03:47:38,000
EVIL, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE

5189
03:47:38,000 --> 03:47:40,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL AND MENTAL

5190
03:47:40,000 --> 03:47:43,000
ILLNESS, BUT WHEN A PERSON LOSES

5191
03:47:43,000 --> 03:47:45,000
PURPOSE, THEY'RE A LOST SOUL AND

5192
03:47:45,000 --> 03:47:48,000
THE DARKNESS IS HARD TO

5193
03:47:48,000 --> 03:47:50,000
PENETRATE.
>> WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR

5194
03:47:50,000 --> 03:47:52,000
PURPOSE.
EVEN I AS A PRIEST, I'M STILL

5195
03:47:52,000 --> 03:47:53,000
LOOKING FOR PURPOSE.

5196
03:47:53,000 --> 03:47:55,000
YOU LOOK FOR PURPOSE.

5197
03:47:55,000 --> 03:47:58,000
EVERY DAY YOU HAVE TO FIND WHAT

5198
03:47:58,000 --> 03:48:01,000
DOES GOD WANT FROM ME?

5199
03:48:01,000 --> 03:48:03,000
I MAKE A CHALLENGE TO THOSE

5200
03:48:03,000 --> 03:48:05,000
LISTENING TODAY.

5201
03:48:05,000 --> 03:48:07,000
AT THIS CHRISTMAS WHEN ALL THESE

5202
03:48:07,000 --> 03:48:08,000
FAMILIES WILL BE SUFFERING

5203
03:48:08,000 --> 03:48:10,000
BECAUSE THEY'VE LOST THEIR

5204
03:48:10,000 --> 03:48:12,000
CHILDREN, GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES

5205
03:48:12,000 --> 03:48:15,000
OR SOME OTHER POSTURE BEFORE

5206
03:48:15,000 --> 03:48:17,000
OPENING GIFTS, BEFORE OPENING

5207
03:48:17,000 --> 03:48:19,000
GIFTS, MY MOTHER ACTUALLY

5208
03:48:19,000 --> 03:48:20,000
SUGGESTED THIS TO ME THIS

5209
03:48:20,000 --> 03:48:22,000
MORNING, AND TO SAY A PRAYER

5210
03:48:22,000 --> 03:48:24,000
WITH YOUR CHILDREN.

5211
03:48:24,000 --> 03:48:26,000
HOWEVER YOU CAN.
IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO PRAY,

5212
03:48:26,000 --> 03:48:27,000
YOU'RE NOT A BELIEVER, A MOMENT

5213
03:48:27,000 --> 03:48:30,000
OF SILENCE, OF GRATITUDE, BUT

5214
03:48:30,000 --> 03:48:31,000
ABOVE ALL, TO SAY THANK GOD FOR

5215
03:48:31,000 --> 03:48:34,000
MY LIFE, THANK GOD FOR MY LOVED

5216
03:48:34,000 --> 03:48:35,000
ONES.

5217
03:48:35,000 --> 03:48:36,000
THAT'S HOW WE CAN CELEBRATE

5218
03:48:36,000 --> 03:48:38,000
CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR, MO

5219
03:48:38,000 --> 03:48:40,000
PROFOUNDLY THAN IN THE PAST.

5220
03:48:40,000 --> 03:48:41,000
I BET SOME OF THESE FAMILIES

5221
03:48:41,000 --> 03:48:43,000
WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT

5222
03:48:43,000 --> 03:48:46,000
THEMSELVES.
>> THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL, FATHER.

5223
03:48:46,000 --> 03:48:47,000
WHAT WILL YOU BE SAYING IN YOUR

5224
03:48:47,000 --> 03:48:48,000
SERVICES TODAY?

5225
03:48:48,000 --> 03:48:49,000
WHAT CAN YOU SAY?

5226
03:48:49,000 --> 03:48:50,000
>> YOU KNOW, I'LL BE TALKING

5227
03:48:50,000 --> 03:48:53,000
ABOUT IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN

5228
03:48:53,000 --> 03:48:55,000
IF YOU WERE IN NEWTOWN.

5229
03:48:55,000 --> 03:48:57,000
WE'RE A LITTLE BIT DIDN'T.

5230
03:48:57,000 --> 03:48:59,000
I'LL TALK ABOUT HOW IS IT

5231
03:48:59,000 --> 03:49:01,000
POSSIBLE A LOVING AND GOOD GOD

5232
03:49:01,000 --> 03:49:03,000
COULD ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.

5233
03:49:03,000 --> 03:49:05,000
ABOUT THE FACT THAT GOD HIMSELF

5234
03:49:05,000 --> 03:49:06,000
ALLOWED HIS SON TO BE MURDERED

5235
03:49:06,000 --> 03:49:09,000
AND STOOD BY AND CRIED AS THE

5236
03:49:09,000 --> 03:49:13,000
EARTH WAS SHAKING.

5237
03:49:13,000 --> 03:49:16,000
I'M ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT

5238
03:49:16,000 --> 03:49:17,000
THAT WITH INDIVIDUALS, BECAUSE

5239
03:49:17,000 --> 03:49:18,000
IT'S NOT JUST A QUESTION, A

5240
03:49:18,000 --> 03:49:20,000
MESSAGE THAT COMES AND GOES BUT

5241
03:49:20,000 --> 03:49:21,000
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH ON A

5242
03:49:21,000 --> 03:49:22,000
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL.

5243
03:49:22,000 --> 03:49:24,000
>> WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU,

5244
03:49:24,000 --> 03:49:26,000
THEN, WE'RE AT A POINT IN OUR

5245
03:49:26,000 --> 03:49:29,000
SOCIETY WHERE PAUL THE APOSTLE

5246
03:49:29,000 --> 03:49:33,000
TALKS ABOUT, THERE ARE PERILOUS

5247
03:49:33,000 --> 03:49:35,000
TIMES WHERE MEN ARE CAUGHT UP

5248
03:49:35,000 --> 03:49:37,000
WITH A LOT OF HATE.

5249
03:49:37,000 --> 03:49:42,000
DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING SAYS HATE

5250
03:49:44,000 --> 03:49:46,000
CAN'T DRIVE OUR HATE, ONLY LIGHT

5251
03:49:46,000 --> 03:49:51,000
CAN DO THAT AND THE CHURCH IS

5252
03:49:51,000 --> 03:49:53,000
THE CONSCIENCENESS OF THE WORLD.

5253
03:49:53,000 --> 03:49:58,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE MORE

5254
03:49:58,000 --> 03:49:59,000
PERILOUS TIMES THAN IN THE PAST.

5255
03:49:59,000 --> 03:50:01,000
THE GOVERNMENT IS KEEPING ORDER

5256
03:50:01,000 --> 03:50:02,000
IN GENERAL SOCIETY BUT I THINK

5257
03:50:02,000 --> 03:50:05,000
IN ALL OF OUR LIVES THERE ARE

5258
03:50:05,000 --> 03:50:06,000
PERILOUS MOMENTS.

5259
03:50:06,000 --> 03:50:08,000
FOR THESE FAMILIES, THIS WAS THE

5260
03:50:08,000 --> 03:50:09,000
PERILOUS MOMENT.

5261
03:50:09,000 --> 03:50:12,000
FOR ALL OF US, AS WE GET CLOSE

5262
03:50:12,000 --> 03:50:16,000
TO OLD AGE, THERE ARE PERILOUS

5263
03:50:16,000 --> 03:50:18,000
MOMENTS.
OUR CULTURE IS MORE GODLESS THAN

5264
03:50:18,000 --> 03:50:20,000
EVER BEFORE IN THE UNITED STATES

5265
03:50:20,000 --> 03:50:21,000
OF AMERICA BUT IT COMES DOWN TO

5266
03:50:21,000 --> 03:50:23,000
MAKING DECISIONS.

5267
03:50:23,000 --> 03:50:28,000
AM I GOING TO LIVE JOY FULLY

5268
03:50:28,000 --> 03:50:31,000
TODAY?
IT COMES IN LOVING OTHERS AND

5269
03:50:31,000 --> 03:50:33,000
BEING LOVED.

5270
03:50:33,000 --> 03:50:34,000
>> FATHER, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

5271
03:50:34,000 --> 03:50:35,000

Hey! Did you know

5277
03:50:50,000 --> 03:50:51,000
And it tastes good?

5278
03:50:51,000 --> 03:50:53,000

Wow.

It's the honey,

Well, would you
look at the time...

What's the rush?

5283

ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOUR HEART

DO NOT TAKE VIAGRA IF YOU TAKE

STATE AND GOVERNOR ARE TRYING TO

RETURN TO SOME LEVEL OF

5317
03:54:29,000 --> 03:54:30,000
NORMALCY.

5318
03:54:30,000 --> 03:54:31,000
>> WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS

5319
03:54:31,000 --> 03:54:33,000
ALLOWING THE OPTION FOR THOSE

5320
03:54:33,000 --> 03:54:35,000
THAT WANT TO FOCUS ON SOMETHING

5321
03:54:35,000 --> 03:54:36,000
ELSE.

5322
03:54:36,000 --> 03:54:38,000
IT'S DIFFICULT IN CONNECTICUT,

5323
03:54:38,000 --> 03:54:41,000
WE HAVE LOST A WEEK BECAUSE OF

5324
03:54:41,000 --> 03:54:42,000
HURRICANE SANDY SO THEY'RE

5325
03:54:42,000 --> 03:54:45,000
TRYING TO GET THE MINIMUM NUMBER

5326

OF SCHOOL DAYS ON THE CALLER.

>> IT'S ONE OF THE BEST SCHOOLS

5328
03:54:52,000 --> 03:54:53,000
IN THE COUNTRY.

5329
03:54:53,000 --> 03:54:56,000
THAT WAS A PROFILE THE

5330
03:54:56,000 --> 03:54:58,000
PRINCIPAL, TO DEDICATED HER LIFE

5331
03:54:58,000 --> 03:54:59,000
TO EDUCATION AND GIVING HER

5332
03:54:59,000 --> 03:55:01,000
STUDENTS THE BEST AND EVEN

5333
03:55:01,000 --> 03:55:03,000
GIVING THE BEST IN SACRIFICING

5334
03:55:03,000 --> 03:55:07,000
HER LIFE FOR THEM.

5335
03:55:07,000 --> 03:55:08,000
>> THAT'S DAWN HOCHSPRUNG, AND

5336
03:55:08,000 --> 03:55:09,000
WE'VE LEARNED TODAY WHILE WE

5337
03:55:09,000 --> 03:55:11,000
WERE ON THE AIR THAT IT WAS PART

5338
03:55:11,000 --> 03:55:14,000
OF PROTOCOL THAT ONE OF THE

5339
03:55:14,000 --> 03:55:15,000
THINGS PRINCIPALS ARE TAUGHT

5340
03:55:15,000 --> 03:55:17,000
WITH NEW SAFETY MEASURES IS TO

5341
03:55:17,000 --> 03:55:20,000
CONFRONT AND CHALLENGE A

5342
03:55:20,000 --> 03:55:24,000
STRANGER.
WE'VE ALSO LEARNED FROM A FRIEND

5343
03:55:24,000 --> 03:55:28,000
OF PRINCIPAL DAWN HOCHSPRUNG SHE

5344
03:55:28,000 --> 03:55:30,000
DID DRILLS FOR THE EVENT OF AN

5345
03:55:30,000 --> 03:55:33,000
ACTIVE SHOOTER COMING INTO THE

5346
03:55:33,000 --> 03:55:36,000
SCHOOL.
WE HAVE HER FRIEND ON "FOX &

5347
03:55:36,000 --> 03:55:39,000
FRIENDS" EARLIER ABOUT THIS.

5348
03:55:39,000 --> 03:55:40,000
>> SHE KNEW THE HEALTH AND

5349
03:55:40,000 --> 03:55:42,000
SAFETY OF HER CHILDREN WERE

5350
03:55:42,000 --> 03:55:45,000
PARAMOUNT.
I THINK THAT THE THING WE NEED

5351
03:55:45,000 --> 03:55:47,000
TO COME AWAY WITH IT THE FACT

5352
03:55:47,000 --> 03:55:50,000
SHE SAVED A GREAT MANY LIVES IN

5353
03:55:50,000 --> 03:55:52,000
TAKING THE ACTIONS SHE DID.

5354
03:55:52,000 --> 03:55:53,000
THE SURE THE HAD THE CAPABILITY

5355
03:55:53,000 --> 03:55:55,000
OF KILLING MUCH MORE AND THE

5356
03:55:55,000 --> 03:55:58,000
TRAGEDY WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR

5357
03:55:58,000 --> 03:56:00,000
WORSE.
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS

5358
03:56:00,000 --> 03:56:02,000
IN OUR WILDEST DREAMS, DID WE

5359
03:56:02,000 --> 03:56:05,000
EVER THINK THE REALITY OF THIS

5360
03:56:05,000 --> 03:56:08,000
CONVERSATION HER AND I HAD WOULD

5361
03:56:08,000 --> 03:56:10,000
ENFOLD INTO REALITY AND CAUSE OF

5362
03:56:10,000 --> 03:56:13,000
LOSS OF HER LIFE, SHE'S TRULY A

5363
03:56:13,000 --> 03:56:14,000
HERO.

5364
03:56:14,000 --> 03:56:15,000
>> TRULY A HERO.

5365
03:56:15,000 --> 03:56:16,000
SHE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS

5366
03:56:16,000 --> 03:56:18,000
DOING WHEN SHE WENT AFTER THE

5367
03:56:18,000 --> 03:56:19,000
GUNMAN.

5368
03:56:19,000 --> 03:56:22,000
>> I ASKED THE FIRST SELECTMEN

5369
03:56:22,000 --> 03:56:24,000
WHAT THEY NEED AND HE SAID HOPES

5370
03:56:24,000 --> 03:56:25,000
AND PRAYERS.

5371
03:56:25,000 --> 03:56:28,000
HIS FIRST REACTION WAS PEOPLE

5372
03:56:28,000 --> 03:56:31,000
NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR SIGNS IN

5373
03:56:31,000 --> 03:56:32,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITY.

5374
03:56:32,000 --> 03:56:34,000
SAY SOMETHING, DO SOMETHING, IF

5375
03:56:34,000 --> 03:56:37,000
YOU SEE A DISTURBING

5376
03:56:37,000 --> 03:56:38,000
18-YEAR-OLD, 20-YEAR-OLD, TALK

5377
03:56:38,000 --> 03:56:42,000
TO SOMEONE.
>> IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS

5378
03:56:42,000 --> 03:56:43,000
ISOLATED, REACH OUT TO THEM IS

5379
03:56:43,000 --> 03:56:47,000
WHAT WE CAME AWAY WITH.

5380
03:56:47,000 --> 03:56:48,000
THERE'S MORE "FOX & FRIENDS" IN

5381
03:56:48,000 --> 03:56:51,000
JUST TWO MINUTES.
t when I was i.

5382
03:56:51,000 --> 03:56:52,000
I was worried the
health care system

5383
03:56:52,000 --> 03:56:54,000
spoke a language all its own

5384
03:56:54,000 --> 03:56:58,000
With UnitedHealthcare,
I got help that fit my life.

5385
03:56:58,000 --> 03:57:00,000
So I never missed a beat.

5386
03:57:00,000 --> 03:57:03,000
That's health in numbers.
