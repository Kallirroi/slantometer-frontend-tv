00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
OF THEM ARE CHILDREN.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
SENSE OF WHEN WE MIGHT BE ABLE

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
TO LEARN EXACTLY WHAT THAT

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
NUMBER, THAT FINAL NUMBER IS

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000

PRETTY CLOSELY ON A NUMBER AT

18
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
THE SCENE, BUT THEY WANT TO DO

19
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
TWO THINGS.

20
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
NUMBER ONE, HAVE THE GOVERNOR

21
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
A SECOND AND A THIRD SWEEP OF

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
THAT SCHOOL TO MAKE SURE THEY

25
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000

26
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU VERY

27
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000

28
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
WITNESSES AND PARENTS, THEY'RE

29
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
STARTING TO TALK ABOUT HOW THIS

30
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
IS ALL UNFOLDING.

31
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES, REALLY,

32
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
THE EMOTIONS JUST POURING OUT

33
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
AND YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THE KIND

34
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
OF TRAGEDY THEY'RE FEELING.

35
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
THESE ARE SOME OF THE FOLKS THIS

36
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
IS WHAT THEY'RE TELLING US.
I WANT TO BRING THEM IN.

37
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
>> YOU'VE BEEN CRYING.

38
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
>> YES.

39
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
>> IS IT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU

40
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
SAW?
>> NO, THEY WOULDN'T EVEN LET US

41
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
IN THE BUILDING.

42
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT ONE OF THE

43
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
COPS THAT, YOU KNOW, THE WORST

44
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
THING HE HAD EVER SEEN IN HIS

45
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
ENTIRE CAREER, BUT IT WAS WHEN

46
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
THEY TOLD THE PARENTS, ALL THE

47
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
PARENTS WERE WAITING FOR THEIR

48
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
CHILDREN TO COME OUT, THEY

49
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
THOUGHT THEY WERE, YOU KNOW,

50
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
STILL ALIVE.

51
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
AND THERE IS 20 PARENTS THAT

52
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
WERE JUST TOLD THEIR CHILDREN

53
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
ARE DEAD.
IT WAS AWFUL.

54
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
>> AND YOU WERE UNABLE TO DO

55
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
ANYTHING.
>> RIGHT.

56
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
WE KNEW AT ONE POINT THEY ASKED

57
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
THE AMBULANCES TO LEAVE, THAT

58
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
THEY DIDN'T NEED THEM AND WE

59
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
KNEW THAT WASN'T A GOOD SIGN.

111
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000

120
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
BLOOD AND GLASS.

121
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
AND THAT'S WHAT HER -- AS MUCH

122
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
AS SHE SAW, THAT'S WHAT SHE SAW.

123
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
AND I GOT A CALL FROM A TEACHER

124
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THIS?

131
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I ASSUME THIS HAS BEEN A PRETTY

132
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE FOR HER.

133
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
>> I DON'T REALLY THINK SHE GETS

134
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
IT RIGHT NOW.

135
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I DON'T -- I DON'T THINK SHE

136
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
UNDERSTANDS HOW SERIOUS THINGS

137
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
ARE.

138
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'M KIND OF EVEN NUMB TO THE

139
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
FACT OF WHAT HAS GONE ON.

140
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'M JUST IN A STATE OF SHOCK,
STILL.

141
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK TIME WILL

142
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
TELL.
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING

143
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
TO HANDLE HAVING HER KNOW ALL

144
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THE, YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE

145
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
SITUATION.

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
THE TEACHERS AND THE PRINCIPAL

151
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
AS WELL, RIGHT?

152
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000

AND YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR A

157
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
BETTER PRINCIPAL.

158

163
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
IMAGINATION, AND I KNOW THIS IS

164
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
A TOUGH SITUATION, LISA, COULD

165
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
YOU EVER IMAGINE A MASS SHOOTING

166
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
IN CONNECTICUT IN YOUR SMALL

167
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
TOWN, NOT FAR AWAY FROM DANBURY?

168
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
DID IT EVER CROSS YOUR MIND

169
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD

170
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
HAPPEN?

171
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
>> WELL, NO.

172
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
BUT, HOWEVER, IT IS HAPPENING SO

173
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
MUCH THAT, YOU KNOW, IT IS THOSE

174
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
TOWNS THAT YOU WOULD LEAST

175
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
SUSPECT IT HAPPENING THAT IT IS

176
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
HAPPENING TO.

177
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
AND WHY IS IT HAPPENING SO MUCH

178
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO IN

179
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
THE FUTURE FOR OTHER SCHOOLS?

180
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
HOW ARE WE GOING TO STOP THIS?

181
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

182
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO?

183
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
>> I WISH I KNEW THE ANSWER TO

184
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
THAT.

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
MORE INFORMATION, GET CONFIRMED

370
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT
CONNECTION HE MAY HAVE IF ANY TO

371
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
THE SCHOOL, AND WE DO KNOW THAT

372
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
WOULD BE STANDARD OPERATING

373
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
PROCEDURE, THAT POLICE WOULD BE

374
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
ACTIVELY SEARCHING HIS HOME FOR

375
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
ANY CLUES AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE

376
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
ALLEGEDLY LED HIM TO THIS.

377
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
WE DO KNOW, ACCORDING TO ANOTHER

378
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
SOURCE, THAT AT LEAST TWO

379
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
WEAPONS WERE RECOVERED FROM HIS

380
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
BODY, WHICH WAS DISCOVERED IN A

381
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
CLASSROOM.
WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE TOOK

382
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
HIS OWN LIFE OR WHETHER HE WAS

383
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
SHOT BY POLICE OR IN SOME OTHER

384
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
WAY.
THOSE TWO WEAPONS DESCRIBED TO

385
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
ME AS A GLOCK AND A SIX HAUR AND

386
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
WE DON'T KNOW THE CALIBER OF

387
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
WEAPONS, BUT WE HEARD MULTIPLE

388
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
SHOTS WERE FIRED.
EYEWITNESSES TALK ABOUT THAT AS

389
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
WELL.

390
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
AND THEY ARE STILL CONDUCTING

391
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
SEARCHES THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL.

392
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
YOU HEARD AUTHORITIES SAY

393
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
THEY'RE SATISFIED THAT THERE ARE

394
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
NO OTHER VICTIMS INSIDE THAT

395
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
SCHOOL.

396
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
WE DO NOT KNOW THE NUMBERS OF

397
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
THOSE WOUNDED.
>> THEY SAY THE AREA IS NOW

398
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
SECURE.
THOUGH THE HORRIFIC SCENE

399
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TO BE

400
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
INVESTIGATED THOROUGHLY.
JUST TO RECAP, CLOSER TO 30

401
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
CONFIRMED DEAD NOW, SUSAN, BASED

402
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
ON YOUR REPORTING.

403
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
18 TO 20 OF THEM CHILDREN.

404
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY

405
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
INDIVIDUALS, CHILDREN, ADULTS,

406
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
WERE INJURED.

407
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
WE DO KNOW THAT SEVERAL WERE

408
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
TAKEN TO NEARBY HOSPITALS,

409
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
ESPECIALLY IN DANBURY,

410
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
CONNECTICUT.

411
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
IS ALL THAT CORRECT, SUSAN?

412
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
>> Reporter: THAT'S CORRECT.

413
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
THAT'S CORRECT.

414
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
AND, OF COURSE, COUNSELING

415
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
SERVICES ARE ALREADY BEING MADE

416
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
AVAILABLE TO THE SURVIVING

417
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
CHILDREN AND ADULTS WHO HAVE

418
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
GONE THROUGH THIS TERRIBLE

419
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
EXPERIENCE AS THEY TRY TO WRAP

420
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
THEIR ARMS AROUND WHAT HAPPENED.

421
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
IMAGINE ALL THESE YOUNG CHILDREN

422
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
AS WELL AS ADULTS WHO HEARD

423
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
GUNFIRE, WHO WERE HURRIED OUT OF

424
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
THE SCHOOL, JUST AS SOON AS

425
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
POLICE SAID IT WAS SAFE FOR THEM

426
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
TO DO SO.

427
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
WHILE POLICE CONDUCTED A

428
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
THOROUGH SEARCH OF THAT SCHOOL.

429
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
THEY SAID THEY'RE SATISFIED THAT

430
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
THAT SCHOOL HAS BEEN CLEARED.

431
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
HOWEVER, THEY STILL NEED ALL THE

432
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO TRY TO

433
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
FIND OUT WHAT LED TO THE

434
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
SHOOTING, PRECISELY WHO THIS

435
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
SHOOTER IS AND WHAT MAY HAVE LED

436
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
TO THIS.

437
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
WOLF?

438
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
>> AND WHERE THIS SHOOTER GOT

439
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
THOSE TWO WEAPONS THAT WERE USED

440
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
IN THIS MASS MURDER AT THIS

441
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

442
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
SUSAN, STAND BY FOR A SECOND.

443
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I WANT OUR VIEWERS TO LISTEN TO

444
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
WHAT A NURSE WHO RUSHED TO THE

445
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
SCENE TO HELP, WHAT SHE JUST
SAID.

446
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
>> I SEE YOU'VE BEEN CRYING.

447
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
>> YES.
>> IS IT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU

448
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
SAW?
>> NO, THEY WOULDN'T EVEN LET US

449
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
IN THE BUILDING.

450
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT ONE OF THE

451
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
COPS SAID, YOU KNOW, THE WORST

452
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
THING HE HAD EVER SEEN IN HIS

453
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
ENTIRE CAREER.
BUT IT WAS WHEN THEY TOLD THE

454
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
PARENTS, ALL THESE PARENTS WERE

455
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
WAITING FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO
COME OUT, THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY

456
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
WERE, YOU KNOW, STILL ALIVE.

457
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
AND THOSE 20 PARENTS THAT WERE

458
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
JUST TOLD THAT THEIR CHILDREN

459
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
ARE DEAD.

460
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
IT WAS AWFUL.

461
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
>> AND YOU WERE UNABLE TO DO

462
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
ANYTHING.

463
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
>> RIGHT.

464
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
WE KNEW AT ONE POINT THEY ASKED

465
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
THE AMBULANCES TO LEAVE, THAT

466
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
THEY DIDN'T NEED THEM, AND WE

467
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
KNEW THAT WASN'T A GOOD SIGN.

468
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
>> ALEXIS, YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE

469
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
SITTING IN CLASS THIS MORNING,

470
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
AND YOU SAW A LOT OF POLICE.

471
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
TELL ME HOW YOU FOUND OUT WHAT

472
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
WAS GOING ON.

473
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
>> WELL, WE FOUND, LIKE, THERE

474
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
WAS ALL THESE PEOPLE, AND WE

475
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
FOUND BECAUSE IT WAS RIGHT NEAR

476
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
THE WINDOW IN OUR CLASSROOM,

477
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
AND, LIKE, WE SAW, LIKE, POLICE

478
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
OFFICERS AND WE HEARD THEM ON

479
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
THE ROOF AND IN OUR BUILDING.

480
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
>> WAS EVERYBODY CRYING, SCARED,

481
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
WANTING THEIR PARENTS TO COME

482
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
GET THEM?

483
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
>> YEAH.

484
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
THEY WERE.
AND THEN SOME PEOPLE WERE EVEN,

485
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
LIKE, THEY KIND OF FELT THEY GOT

486
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
A STOMACH ACHE.

487
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
>> DID YOU HEAR ANY GUNSHOTS OR

488
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

489
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
>> WELL, THE POLICE OFFICERS,

490
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
LIKE, THEY WERE -- THEY WERE

491
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
KIND OF, BECAUSE THEY WERE

492
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
POLICE OFFICERS, LIKE RIGHT OUT

493
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
THE DOOR TRYING TO FIND THE GUY.

494
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
>> WHAT A HORRIFIC SCENE INDEED,

495
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
JUST TO RECAP.

496
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
THE SHOOTER IN THIS CASE, THE

497
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
SUSPECTED GUNMAN IDENTIFIED NOW

498
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
AS RYAN LANZA.

499
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
IN HIS 20s.
THAT ACCORDING TO A LAW

500
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
ENFORCEMENT SOURCE WHO TOLD THAT

501
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
TO CNN, THE SHOOTER DIED AT THE

502
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
SCENE.
WE DON'T KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES

503
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
ON HOW HE DIED.

504
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
WE'RE WORKING THOSE DETAILS AS

505
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
WELL.

506
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
WE DO KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT OF

507
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
THE UNITED STATES, PRESIDENT

508
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
OBAMA, HAS BEEN BRIEFED ON WHAT

509
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

510
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
HE WANTS TO GET A FIRMER GRASP

511
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
ON WHAT IS GOING ON BEFORE HE

512
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
SPEAKS OUT PUBLICLY ACCORDING TO

513
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
OUR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT

514
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
BRIANNA KEILAR.
BUT HE WILL BE MAKING A

515
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
STATEMENT, JESSICA YELLIN, OUR

516
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT,

517
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
DOES TELL US.

518
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I THINK BASED ON OUR REPORTING

519
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO WAIT

520
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
UNTIL THE GOVERNOR OF

521
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
CONNECTICUT HAS ACTUALLY SPOKEN

522
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
UP ON THIS ISSUE, THE WHITE

523
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
HOUSE ANXIOUS TO GET

524
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
INFORMATION, THE PRESIDENT HAS

525
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
BEEN FULLY BRIEFED ON WHAT WE

526
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
KNOW RIGHT NOW.

527
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
AND, REMEMBER, A LOT OF TIMES IN

528
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
A SITUATION LIKE THIS, A

529
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
DEVELOPING SITUATION, SOME OF

530
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
THE INITIAL INFORMATION PROVES

531
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
TO BE INACCURATE, SO WE WANT TO

532
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
BE AS PRECISE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN

533
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
BE.

534
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
BASED ON OUR REPORTING FROM

535
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, THOUGH, WHO IS

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000

CONNECTICUT, CLOSE TO 30 PEOPLE

538
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
ARE DEAD.

539
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
OF THEM, 18 TO 20 CHILDREN AT

540
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
THAT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

541
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
SCHOOL.

542
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI IS STILL WITH

543
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
US.

544
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
SUSAN, PARENTS WHO HAVE RUSHED

545
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
TO THAT SCHOOL, ESPECIALLY THOSE

546
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
PARENTS WHO ARE GETTING THE

547
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
AWFUL NEWS ABOUT THEIR KIDS, DO

548
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE, HOW

549
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
THIS IS BEING HANDLED?

550
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
>> Reporter: WELL, I KNOW THAT

551
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
WHEN THE CHILDREN WERE FIRST LED

552
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
FROM THE SCHOOL, AND THIS WAS

553
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
AFTER POLICE SAID THEY HAD

554
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
SEARCHED EVERY CRACK AND

555
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
CREVICE, THEY SAID, OF THE

556
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
SCHOOL, TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS

557
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
SAFE TO EVACUATE THE CHILDREN,

558
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
THEY WERE LED, SOME OF THEM IN

559
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
LINES AND MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN

560
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
PICTURES OR VIDEOTAPE OF THIS,

561
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
WITH THE SMALL CHILDREN, WE'RE

562
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
TALKING ABOUT KINDERGARTEN TO

563
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
FOURTH GRADE, PLACING ONE CHILD

564
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
ON THE SHOULDERS IN FRONT OF

565
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
THEM AND BEING LED TO A NEARBY

566
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
FIREHOUSE WHICH IS USED AS A

567
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
STAGING AREA WHERE THEY HAD

568
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
ADULTS WHO HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO

569
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
TRY TO COMFORT THESE CHILDREN,

570
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
AND USE THAT SPACE AS SOME PLACE

571
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
FOR PARENTS TO GO TO BE

572
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
RECONNECTED, REUNITED WITH THEIR

573
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
CHILDREN.
WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THE PARENTS

574
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
TOLD US THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT

575
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
THIS, THE NEWS MEDIA, BUT OTHERS

576
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
QUICKLY GOT INFORMATION VIA

577
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
THEIR TEXT PHONE, OR E-MAILS,

578
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD SIGN

579
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000

580
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
IS COMMON PLACE THESE DAYS.

582
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
WE ALSO KNOW, WOLF, THAT AFTER

583
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
THE SCHOOL WAS CLEARED, POLICE

584
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
AND INVESTIGATORS CONTINUE TO

585
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
LOOK THROUGH THE AREA, TO MAKE

586
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
SURE THAT, IN FACT, THERE MIGHT

587
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
NOT BE A SECOND SHOOTER

588
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
INVOLVED.
THEY HAD ISOLATED ONE CAR IN

589
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
PARTICULAR, BUT WERE CONTINUING

590
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
TO WALK DOWN THE STREET AND

591
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
SEARCH AND LOOK AT OTHER

592
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
VEHICLES, OTHER BUILDINGS IN

593
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
THAT AREA.

594
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
ALSO, ACCORDING TO A SOURCE, WE

595
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
KNOW THAT SOMEONE ELSE WAS BEING

596
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
QUESTIONED, WHO WAS NOT BEING

597
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
CALLED A SUSPECT AT THIS TIME,

598
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
BUT SOMEONE ELSE IS BEING

599
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
QUESTIONED IN CONNECTION WITH

600
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
THIS INVESTIGATION.
THAT'S ALL WE HAVE ON THAT FOR

601
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000

602
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
HOWEVER, THE STATE POLICE DO SAY

603
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
THAT THEY HAVE AN ACTIVE SEARCH,

604
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
WE PRESUME THEY MEAN A SEARCH

605
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
WARRANT BEING CONDUCTED AT THE

606
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000

WORST MASS KILLING AT A SCHOOL

657
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
IN U.S. HISTORY, BASED ON THE

IF THOSE NUMBERS HOLD UP.

670
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE THE

671
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
WORST MASS KILLING IN AMERICAN

672
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
HISTORY, SOMETHING NO ONE

IN -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY IN A

717
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
SIMILAR SITUATION, WOLF, BECAUSE

718
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
OBVIOUSLY EVERY TRAGEDY IS

719
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
DIFFERENT, BUT FOLLOWING THE

720
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
SHOOTING OF CONGRESSWOMAN

TERRIBLE SHOOTING AT THE MOVIE

THEATER IN COLORADO, THESE WERE

724
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
POINTS IN TIME WHERE PRESIDENT

OBAMA, AS OTHER PRESIDENTS

726
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
GIVE A UNIFIED MESSAGE AND

728
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000

AND UNDERSTANDING FOR THE PEOPLE

730
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
WHO ARE AFFECTED BY A SHOOTING

I WAS THERE AS WELL.

733
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
THAT WAS SOMETHING WHERE WE SAW

734
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
THEN GOVERNOR CAINE AND

735
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH COME IN AS

736
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
VOICES BECAUSE IN A TRAGEDY LIKE

737
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
THIS, OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE A LOT

738
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE RAISED.

739
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT

740
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
ARE RAISED IN THAT SORT OF --

741
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
THAT'S ONE OF THE ROLES OF THE

742
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
PRESIDENT IN A SITUATION LIKE

743
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
THIS, TO TRY TO SPEAK TO THAT

744
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
AND BE A UNIFYING VOICE.

745
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
BEHIND THE SCENES, WE KNOW,

746
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
WOLF, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS BEING

747
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
REGULARLY UPDATED ON THIS.

748
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
YOU KNOW, PRIOR TO THIS MORNING,

749
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
OBVIOUSLY THE CONCERNS WERE VERY

750
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
MUCH SURROUNDING SOMETHING VERY

751
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
DIFFERENT, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

752
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
A DEAL OR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

753
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
WHERE TO GO WITH THE ISSUE OF

754
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
THE FISCAL CLIFF.
AT THIS POINT, OBVIOUSLY,

755
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ATTENTIONS

756
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
HAVE BEEN CHANGED, UNEXPECTEDLY,

757
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
TO HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS

758
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
SHOOTING IN CONNECTICUT AND

759
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
EXACTLY GRASPING -- THIS IS

760
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
SOMETHING HIS TEAM AROUND HIM IS

761
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
WORKING ON, THE DETAILS OF THE

762
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
INVESTIGATION, OBVIOUSLY.

763
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
SOME OF THE INFORMATION WILL BE

764
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
SOMETHING THAT THE WHITE HOUSE,

765
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS

766
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
ADVISERS ARE PRIVY TO BEFORE

767
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE, WOLF.

768
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
>> AND THE PRESIDENT WILL BE

769
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
MAKING A STATEMENT.

770
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN OR

771
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
WHERE.

772
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
SOME PLACE IN THE WHITE HOUSE

773
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
HE'LL BE SPEAKING OUT.

774
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
ARE THEY PREPARING FOR THAT

775
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
ALREADY?

776
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
WE KNOW HE WANTS TO -- HE WANTS

777
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
TO HEAR FROM THE GOVERNOR FIRST,

778
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
THE GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT.

779
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
>> Reporter: LET ME TELL YOU

780
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
THAT, BECAUSE I REPORTED THAT,

781
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
THAT HE WAS WAITING TO HEAR FROM

782
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
THE GOVERNOR.

783
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'M NOW TOLD BY THE SAME SENIOR

784
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL THAT I

785
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
SPOKE WITH BEFORE THAT HE MAY

786
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
NOT BE WAITING FOR THE GOVERNOR

787
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
TO SPEAK FIRST BECAUSE HE'S HAD

788
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THIS PHONE CONVERSATION WITH

789
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
GOVERNOR MALLOY.

790
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT

791
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA COMES OUT AND

792
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
MAKES A STATEMENT BEFORE THE

793
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
GOVERNOR.
I THINK THAT MAY BE AN

794
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
INDICATION THAT PERHAPS THE

795
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
TIMELINE COULD BE MOVED UP, BUT

796
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
BEYOND WHAT IT WAS BEFORE, BUT

797
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
AT THIS POINT, IT IS VERY FLUID.

798
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE SET AND

799
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
IT IS CERTAINLY NOT PUBLIC AS TO

800
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
WHEN THE PRESIDENT WILL MAKE A

801
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
STATEMENT, WOLF.

802
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
>> WE'LL STAND BY, HAVE COVERAGE

803
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
OBVIOUSLY OF THAT.
AND WE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE

804
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
GOVERNORS AID, ONE OF THE

805
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
GOVERNOR'S AIDS THAT HE IS

806
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
MEETING WITH FAMILIES, TRYING TO

807
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
CONSOLE THEM.

808
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
HE'S ON THE SCENE.

809
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
AT SOME POINT THE GOVERNOR,

810
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
DANNEL MALLOY WILL BE SPEAKING
AS WELL.

811
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
DAVID ARIOSO IS ON THE SCENE.

812
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
FROM YOUR ADVANTAGE POINT,

813
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
DAVID, TELL US WHAT YOU'RE

814
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
SEEING.
>> I'M RIGHT OUTSIDE THE

815
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
FIREHOUSE BEING USED AS A

816
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
MAKESHIFT SHELTER FOR WHICH

817
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
FAMILY MEMBERS, INCLUDING

818
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
PARENTS AND CHILDREN, ARE HOLED

819
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
UP.

820
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
YOU DO SEE PARENTS WALKING BACK

821
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
AND FORTH ON A WOODED STRETCH

822
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
THAT LEADS UP TOWARD THE SCHOOL,

823
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
OFTENTIMES CLUTCHING THEIR

824
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
CHILDREN, CLUTCHING EACH OTHER,

825
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
TALKING ON CELL PHONES AND

826
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
ALMOST ALL THE WHILE THEY'RE

827
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
TEARY EYED.

828
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
MOST PEOPLE WON'T SPEAK WITH US,

829
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
WE DID GET A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO

830
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
ONE LITTLE GIRL, AN 8-YEAR-OLD,

831
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
THIRD GRADER, WHO WAS INSIDE THE

832
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
SCHOOL WHEN ALL THIS TRANSPIRED.

833
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
POLICE ESSENTIALLY BARGED IN,

834
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
THE TEACHERS BARGED IN AND

835
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
ORDERED THEM TO HIDE IN THE

836
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
CLASSROOM.
THEY WERE ALL CRYING AS POLICE

837
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
AND AUTHORITIES TRIED TO FIGURE

838
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
OUT WHAT THE SITUATION WAS, WHAT

839
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
THE CRISIS WAS.

840
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
AND ESSENTIALLY THEIR PARENTS

841
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
WERE INFORMED BY AN AUTOMATED

842
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
PHONE CALL THAT THERE HAD BEEN A

843
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
SHOOTING AT A SCHOOL.

844
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
THEY DIDN'T INDICATE WHICH

845
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
SCHOOL, AND SO MANY OF THE

846
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
PARENTS HERE IN THE REGION

847
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
FRANTICALLY FLOCKED TO THE

848
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
SCHOOLS WHERE THEY HAD CHILDREN

849
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
ATTENDING.

850
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
THIS PARTICULAR PARENT I SPOKE

851
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
TO WAS FRANTIC, ARRIVED HERE AT

852
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
THE SCHOOL AND FORTUNATELY FOUND

853
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
HER DAUGHTER UNHARMED.

854
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
SO WHEN WE MET UP WITH HER, SHE

855
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
WAS CLUTCHING HER, THROWING THIS

856
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
OVERSIZED COAT AROUND HER AS

857
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
THEY WALKED UP THE ROAD AND AWAY

858
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
FROM THE SCHOOL.

859
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
AND IT IS REALLY ONE OF THOSE

860
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
SCENES, WOLF, THAT YOU REALLY

861
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
JUST CAN'T PUT YOUR FINGER ON

862
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
AND ASK ENOUGH QUESTIONS AS TO

863
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
WHY ALL THIS TRANSPIRED.

864
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
THE COMMUNITY HERE IS STILL VERY

865
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
MUCH IN SHOCK.

866
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
THERE ARE QUESTIONS NOT ONLY OF

867
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
WHAT ACTUALLY TRANSPIRED IN

868
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
TERMS OF THE DETAILS, BUT WHY

869
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
SOMEONE WOULD DO THIS.

870
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
A LOT OF TEARS HERE IN THIS

871
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
AWAY FROM NEW YORK CITY AS WELL,

875
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
MUCH CLOSER TO DANBURY,

876
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
CONNECTICUT.

877
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
DAVID, HOLD ON FOR A MOMENT.

878
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
MARY SNOW IS IN NEWTOWN AS WELL,

880
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
ARE YOU SEEING OVER THERE, MARY?

881
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
>> WE'RE BEING KEPT FAR BACK

882
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
FROM THE SUSPECT'S HOME.

883
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
THE POLICE HAVE CORDONED OFF

884
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
THIS AREA.

885
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
THERE ARE MULTIPLE LAW

886
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES LINED UP

887
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000

00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
KEPT AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES AS

WELL AND LOOKING AT A CAR, A

890
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
LINE OF VEHICLES LINED UP OF

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
RESIDENTS WHO ARE TOLD THEY

892
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
CANNOT GO TO THEIR HOMES BECAUSE

893
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
POLICE TAPE HAS BEEN PUT UP.

894
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000

THEY'RE SO SHAKEN TO THE CORE AS

910
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE.

911
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
ONE WOMAN FILLING UP WITH TEARS

912
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000

00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
UNDERSTANDABLY, SHE SAID THERE

984
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
WAS YELLING IN THE HALLWAY, AND

985
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
SHE COULDN'T -- SHE COULDN'T

986
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
TELL FOR A WHILE IF IT WAS THE

987
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000

988
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
WHEN I TALKED TO HER, SHE WAS

989
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
STILL INSIDE THE SCHOOL, THE

990
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
SCHOOL WAS ON LOCKDOWN SHE
DIDN'T KNOW IF THE SHOOTER WAS

991
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
DEAD YET OR STILL THERE.

>> I DIDN'T -- I DIDN'T HEAR HER

995
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
DESCRIBE THAT.

996
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, SHE SAID,

997
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
LISTEN, THIS IS A NICE TOWN,

998
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
THIS IS A NICE SCHOOL, THESE ARE

999
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
THE KIND OF THINGS THAT DON'T

1000
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000

SHE NOTED THIS WAS NOT SOME HIGH

1001
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
POWERED MEETING.

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
IT WAS, YOU KNOW, ABOUT MY --

1003
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
ABOUT ONE OF MY CHILDREN WHO WAS

1004
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
IN SECOND GRADE THERE.

1005
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
AND SHE -- SHE WAS TEARFUL,

1006
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
SHE'S, YOU KNOW, JUST

1007
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
UNDERSTANDABLY PANICKED, AND SHE

1008
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
SAID THEY MARCHED, AT SOME

1009
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
POINT, I DON'T HAVE THE LENGTH

1010
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
OF TIME, BUT SHE SAID AT SOME

1011
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
POINT AFTER THE SHOOTING THEY

1012
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
MARCHED US OUT IN THE HALLWAY,

1013
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
RIGHT PAST THE TWO BODIES,

1014
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
LAYING IN THE HALLWAY IN A POOL

1015
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
OF BLOOD.

1016
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
>> WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT THE TWO

1017
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
BODIES, IS THAT OF THE PRINCIPAL

1018
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
AND THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST WHEN

1019
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
SHE SAID THOSE TWO HAD NOT

1020
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
RETURNED?
ARE THOSE THE TWO INDIVIDUALS

1021
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
THAT SHE --
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1022
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000

1023
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
>> AND DID SHE SAY OR DESCRIBE

1024
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
IN ANY WAY WHAT THEIR CONDITIONS

1025
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
LOOKED LIKE WHEN SHE PASSED IN

1026
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000

1027
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
>> NO, SHE DID NOT.

1028
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
SHE DID NOT.

1029
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000

1031
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000

00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
PARENTS TO DROP OFF THEIR KIDS,

1093
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THESE

1094
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000

AT WHAT DID UNFOLD.

1100
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
WHEN YOU HAVE SHOOTERS WHO ARE

1101
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
COMMITTED TO COME ON TO A CAMPUS

1102
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
WITH HIGH POWERED SEMIAUTOMATIC

1103
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
WEAPONS, THERE IS NOT A WHOLE

1104
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
LOT THAT CAN BE DONE WHEN THIS

1105
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
STAFF IS UNARMED AND WHEN THEY

1106
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
ATTACK CHILDREN WHO ARE SO

1107
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
YOUNG.
AND OFTENTIMES OUR ELEMENTARY

1108
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
SCHOOLS ARE THE LAST OF THE

1109
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
SCHOOLS TO EVER GET AN ARMS

1110
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER OR

1111
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
SOMEONE LIKE THAT.

1112
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
THIS IS A TRAGIC REMINDER OF HOW

1113
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
VULNERABLE OUR CHILDREN CONTINUE

1114
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
TO BE.

1115
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE JUST

1116
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
LIMITATIONS ON WHAT THE SCHOOL

1117
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
CAN DO.

1118
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
THEY NEED TO HAVE GOOD SAFE,

1119
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
SCHOOL PLANS IN PLACE.

1120
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
ADEQUATE SUPERVISION, BUT WHEN

1121
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS DERANGED

1122
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
AND COMES ON THE CAMPUS LIKE

1123
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
THIS, IT IS TRULY TRAGIC.

1124
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
>> THIS IS A SMALL SCHOOL, A

1125
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FOURTH

1126
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
GRADE, LESS THAN 600 STUDENTS

1127
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
ATTEND THIS SANDY HOOK

1128
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN,

1129
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
CONNECTICUT.
RONALD, HOLD ON FOR A MOMENT.

1130
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
JOHN KING IS GETTING MORE

1131
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000

1132
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING, JOHN?

1133
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
>> Reporter: WOLF, I WANT TO

1134
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
PASS ON SOME INFORMATION.
THIS IS FROM A SECOND FEDERAL

1135
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE I SPOKE

1136
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
TO IN WASHINGTON, D.C., GETTING

1137
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
INFORMATION FROM FBI OFFICIALS

1138
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
ON THE SCENE, OTHER FEDERAL AND

1139
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
STATE AUTHORITIES ON THE SCENE.

1140
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
THIS SOURCE NOW SAYING THAT 27

1141
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
IS THE NEW, BUT STILL

1142
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
PRELIMINARY NUMBER.
THEY ARE WORKING OFF NOW.

1143
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
THEY BELIEVE 27 KILLED IN THIS

1144
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING.

1145
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
THEY CALL THAT NUMBER NEW BUT

1146
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
PRELIMINARY, BUT THERE COULD BE

1147
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
IN A BREAKING NEWS TRAGEDY LIKE

1148
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
THIS, OFTEN THE NUMBERS CHANGE

1149
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
AS THE DAY GOES ON AND MORE N

1150
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

1151
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
OF THE 27 THIS SOURCE SAID AT

1152
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
LEAST 18, AT LEAST 18 OF THE

1153
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
DEAD ARE CHILDREN AT THE SCHOOL

1154
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
TODAY.

1155
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
THIS SOURCE GOING ON TO SAY THAT

1156
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
INFORMATION FROM THE SCENE IS

1157
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
THE SHOOTER YOU'VE BEEN TALKING

1158
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
ABOUT WITH OTHER REPORTERS WAS

1159
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
BORN IN 1988, BELIEVE HE'S 24

1160
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
YEARS OLE.

1161
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
THAT'S INFORMATION FROM THE

1162
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
SCENE.
THEY BELIEVE THAT IS RELIABLE

1163
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
INFORMATION.
AND THAT THE SHOOTER WHO IS DEAD

1164
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
AT THE SCENE IS, QUOTE, NOT A

1165
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
STRANGER TO THE SCHOOL, NOT A

1166
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
STRANGER TO THE SCHOOL.

1167
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
THIS OFFICIAL SAID.

1168
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
HE ALSO SAID THE SHOOTINGS,

1169
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
QUOTE, HAPPENED RELATIVELY

1170
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
QUICKLY AND IN THE SAME

1171
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
CONCENTRATED AREA OF THE SCHOOL.

1172
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
HE WAS NOT RUNNING THE HALLS,

1173
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
MEANING NOT RUNNING THE HALLS

1174
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
FIRING THE WEAPON.

1175
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
SO THE SOURCE, AGAIN, I WANT TO

1176
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000

1177
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
RELATIVELY QUICKLY AND IN THE

1178
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
SAME CONCENTRATED AREA OF THE

1179
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
SCHOOL, AND, AGAIN, THIS SOURCE

00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
OPERATING ON.

1182
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
YOU MENTIONED.

1183
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
WE'LL HEAR FROM THE GOVERNOR

1184
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
SHORTLY, HE'S ASKED STATE POLICE

1185
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
AT THE SCENE AND OTHERS AT THE

1186
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
SCENE NOT TO RELEASE THE FIRM

1187
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
NUMBER UNTIL HE CAN SPEAK TO ALL

1188
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
OF THE FAMILIES INVOLVED, BUT

1189
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
WE'RE GETTING AT ROUGHLY

1190
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
CONSISTENT IN THAT AREA, THIS

1191
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
SOURCE SAYING 27 IS THE NUMBER

1192
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
THEY BELIEVE.
A FEDERAL OFFICIAL, A SECOND

1193
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
SOURCE I SPOKE TO EARLIER SAID

1194
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
HE WAS HEARING 26 OR 27 AND

1195
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
CERTAINLY SAID THEY ARE

1196
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
CONVINCED FROM THE REPORTS

1197
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
THEY'RE GETTING FROM THE SCENE

1198
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
THAT THE NUMBER OF DEAD, WOLF,

1199
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
CLOSER TO 30 THAN TO 20.

1200
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
>> ANY WORD AT ALL ON INJURIES?

1201
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
WE KNOW LOCAL HOSPITALS HAVE

1202
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
RECEIVED INJURED STUDENTS AND

1203
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
OTHERS.
>> Reporter: I WAS TOLD BY ONE

1204
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
OF THE FIRST SOURCE EARLIER THAT

1205
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED AND

1206
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
TAKEN TO LOCAL HOSPITALS BECAUSE

1207
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
THEY WERE SO FOCUSED ON TRYING

1208
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
TO GET THE NUMBER OF FATALITIES

1209
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
AND TRYING TO DEAL WITH MAKING

1210
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
SURE THAT THEY HAD DOUBLED,

1211
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
TRIPLE CHECKED THAT SCHOOL, BOTH

1212
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
FOR EVIDENCE AND TO MAKE SURE

1213
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
THERE WERE NO OTHER BODIES, NO

1214
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
OTHER PEOPLE HIDING, THAT IN MY

1215
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SOURCES,

1216
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
THAT WAS THEIR URGENT CONCERN.

1217
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
THE SOURCE I DID SPEAK TO

1218
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
EARLIER, THIS IS A LITTLE MORE

1219
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
THAN AN HOUR AGO, THE FIRST

1220
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
SOURCE SAID THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE

1221
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
WERE WOUNDED, DID NOT HAVE ANY

1222
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
INFORMATION ON THE SEVERITY OF

1223
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
THOSE INJURIES.

1224
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
>> AWAITING WORD FROM THE

1225
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT, DANNEL

1226
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
MALLOY, ALSO AWAITING WORD FROM

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
BE MAKING STATEMENTS SOON.

1230
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
WE'LL GET MORE INFORMATION FROM

1231
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND THE

1232
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
GOVERNOR.
JOHN, STAND BY.

1233
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING YOUR

1234
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
SOURCES, GETTING MORE
INFORMATION AS WELL.

1235
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
BROOKE BALDWIN IS JOINING US

1236
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
FROM THE CNN CENTER RIGHT NOW.

1237
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
BROOKE, WHAT A HORRIFIC,

1238
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
HORRIFIC MOMENT.
AT THE BEGINNING, I'M SURE LIKE

1239
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
YOU, WHEN WE FIRST HEARD WORD OF

1240
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
WHAT WAS GOING ON, WE THOUGHT,

1241
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
YOU KNOW, ANOTHER INCIDENT, BUT

1242
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
THEN THE HORRIFIC NUMBERS START

1243
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
COMING IN AND YOU THINK OF THESE

1244
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
LITTLE KIDS, KINDERGARTEN, FIRST

1245
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
GRADE, SECOND GRADE, THIRD

1246
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
GRADE, FOURTH GRADE IN A SMALL

1247
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LIKE THIS, AND

1248
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
YOU SAY, HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?

1249
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
>> EXACTLY.

1250
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
MY HEART IS HEAVY TODAY AND I

1251
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
THINK MANY PEOPLE AROUND CNN,

1252
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
AROUND THE NATION, AROUND THE

1253
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
WORLD, ARE FEELING FOR THESE

1254
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
PARENTS, THE PARENTS, OF COURSE,

1255
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
OF THE SURVIVORS, BUT I'M

1256
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
THINKING PARTICULARLY OF THESE

1257
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
PARENTS WHO ARE SITTING IN THIS

1258
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
FIREHOUSE, NEAR THIS SCHOOL,

1259
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
WONDERING IF ONE OF THEIR

1260
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
CHILDREN IS ONE OF THOSE WHO IS

1261
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
NO LONGER WITH US.

1262
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
AS WE CONTINUE TO WATCH THESE

1263
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
PICTURES AND PRAY AND THINK
ABOUT THIS COMMUNITY, THIS

1264
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
SLEEPY NEW ENGLAND COMMUNITY

1265
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
HERE IN CONNECTICUT, I WANT TO
BRING IN VICTOR BLACKWELL, WHO

1266
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
HAS BEEN SORT OF COMBING THROUGH

1267
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
SOME OF THE DAY, AS THIS HAS

1268
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
BEEN A VERY FLUID STORY.

1269
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM LITTLE

1270
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
ONES, ADULTS, PARENTS, POLICE,

1271
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
IT IS HORRIFIC.

1272
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
>> AND IT IS A NATIONAL TRAGEDY.

1273
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
BUT AS YOU LOOK AT THE CHILDREN,

1274
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
AND THEIR PARENTS, YOU REALIZE

1275
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
THIS IS ALSO A VERY PERSONAL

1276
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
TRAGEDY.
A SMALL TOWN, A RELATIVELY SMALL

1277
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
SCHOOL, AND THESE CHILDREN WERE

1278
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000

THIS IS NOT FT. HOOD.

WITHOUT BEING MAUDLIN THAT

1367
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000

SHE SAID HER HEART WAS IN A

1369
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
MILLION PIECES, WHEN SHE HEARD

1370
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
ABOUT THE SHOOTING, AND EVEN UP

1371
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
TO THIS MOMENT OF ALL THIS

1372
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000

00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
SAID IT DOESN'T SEEM REAL THERE

1374
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
ARE STILL ALL THE PARENTS WHO

1375
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
WILL GO HOME TODAY, AND

1376
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
POSSIBLY, BECAUSE IT IS THE

HOLIDAY SEASON, ALREADY HAVE THE

>> THE GIFTS FOR THE KIDS.

1381
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
>> THE GIFTS FOR THE KIDS NOT

1382
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
COMING HOME.

1383
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
IF THAT NUMBER HOLDS, 27 FROM

1384
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
JOHN KING'S SOURCES, THAT WOULD

1385
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
MAKE THIS THE SECOND DEADLIEST

1386
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
MASS SHOOTING AND WOULD HAVE

1387
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
BEEN THE SECOND DEADLIEST JUST

1388
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
WITH THE 18 CHILDREN WHO WERE

1389
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
KILLED TODAY.

1390
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
>> IT IS HORRENDOUS.

1391
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I WAS -- I COVERED THE -- A

1392
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
COUPLE OF ITTY-BITTY KIDS KILLED

1393
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
IN THE AMISH SHOOTING, BUT THERE

1394
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
IS NO COMPARISON.

1395
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO

1396
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
COMPARISON AS YOU POINT OUT,

1397
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
WE'RE TALKING KIDS AS YOUNG AS

1398
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
KINDERGARTNERS.

1399
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
WOLF BLITZER, YOU HAVE A

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
IMAGINE.
MY HEART IS BLEEDING FOR THESE

1402
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
FAMILIES RIGHT NOW.

1403
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
>> SO SAD.

1404
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
EVERYONE AROUND THE COUNTRY,

1405
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
DARE I SAY AROUND THE WORLD, OUR

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
HEARTS ARE SO FILLED WITH

1407
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
SADNESS RIGHT NOW.
AND IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET

1408
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
WORSE AS WE GET MORE DETAILS AND

1409
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
JUST IMAGINE, BROOKE, ONCE WE

1410
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000

00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
ALL HAVE TO ENDURE AND LEARN

1416
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
SOME PAINFUL LESSONS FROM WHAT

1417
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
HAS JUST HAPPENED.

1418
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
WE JUST GOT THIS COMMENT FROM A

1419
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
YOUNG KID WHO WAS THERE ON THE

1420
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
SCENE, WITNESSED WHAT WAS GOING

1421
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
ON, AND SAID THIS.

1422
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
>> THERE WAS, LIKE, POLICE

1423
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
OFFICERS, LIKE, DOWN ON THE ROOF

1424
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
AND THERE WAS ALSO IN THE

1425
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
HALLWAYS.

1426
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
>> WHAT WERE THEY KELLING YOU

1427
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
GUYS?
>> THEY DIDN'T REALLY TELL US

1428
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
ANYTHING.
JUST KEEP IN THE CLASSROOM.

1429
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
>> THEY REMOVED YOU.

1430
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
>> THEY MOVED THEM TO THE

1431
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
FIREHOUSE.
THAT'S WHERE ALL THE PARENTS AND

1432
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
EVERYBODY CAME.

1433
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
>> WERE ALL THE KIDS BRAVE LIKE

1434
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
YOU WERE?

1435
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
>> SOME OF THEM WERE, LIKE, A

1436
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
LITTLE SCARED.

1437
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
BUT WE HAD TO GO THROUGH IT.

1438
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
>> HOW DID YOU KNOW THEY WERE

1439
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
SCARED?
>> EVERYBODY WAS, LIKE, CRYING

1440
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
AND STUFF.

1441
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
>> RONALD STEVENS IS WITH US,

1442
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE

1443
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
NATIONAL SCHOOL SAFETY CENTER.

1444
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
RONALD, WE KNOW THERE ARE SOME

1445
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
SCHOOLS IN URBAN AREAS, BUT

1446
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
ELSEWHERE, THAT HAVE METAL

1447
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
DETECTORS AT THE DOORWAYS.

1448
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
ARE WE GOING TO BE SEEING MORE

1449
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
OF THIS NOW?

1450
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
SHOULD WE SEE MORE OF THIS NOW?

1451
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
>> IT'S POSSIBLE WE MIGHT SEE

1452
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
MORE.
BUT EVEN WITH METAL DETECTORS,

1453
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
THINGS HAPPEN SO QUICKLY, YOU

1454
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
CAN THINK OF THE SITUATION AT

1455
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
RED LAKE, MINNESOTA, WHERE THEY

1456
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
HAD OFFICERS AND METAL DETECTORS

1457
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
AT THE DOOR AND YET THE SHOOTER

1458
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
STILL CAME IN.
IT IS ONE OF THOSE TRAGEDIES

1459
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
THAT IS JUST SIMPLY

1460
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
UNFATHOMABLE, AND I DON'T KNOW

1461
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
OF ANY SCHOOL IN AMERICA THAT

1462
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
WOULD BE PREPARED TO HANDLE AN

1463
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
ASSAULT-LIKE INCIDENT THAT WE

1464
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THIS

1465
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
MORNING.

1466
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
>> SO DOES THAT MEAN WE JUST

1467
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
THROW UP OUR HANDS AND SAY THERE

1468
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
IS NOTHING WE CAN DO?

1469
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
>> I DON'T THINK IT MEANS THAT.

1470
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
WHEN WE START LOOKING INTO THIS

1471
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
MATTER AND DOING THE

1472
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
INVESTIGATION, I THINK WE'RE

1473
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
GOING TO FIND, I WILL PREDICT

1474
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
WE'LL FIND THAT THERE WERE A

1475
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
NUMBER OF WARNING SIGNS, IN

1476
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
ADVANCE, MOST OF THE SHOOTINGS

1477
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
LIKE THIS REFLECT THAT THERE

1478
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
GENERALLY ARE MORE THAN ONE --

1479
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
IS MORE THAN ONE PERSON

1480
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
INVOLVED, AND THAT THERE WERE

1481
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
SOME SIGNALS PERHAPS ALONG THE

1482
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
WAY, BUT ONCE AGAIN, WE HAVE

1483
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
SUCH INCREDIBLE FREEDOM IN THIS

1484
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
COUNTRY, AND YET THAT COMES WITH

1485
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY AND TO

1486
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
EVEN FATHOM THIS KIND OF TRAGEDY

1487
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
VISITED UPON YOUNG CHILDREN OF

1488
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
THIS NATURE IS STUNNING.

1489
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
>> IT LOOKS LIKE NOW BASED ON

1490
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
THE LATEST INFORMATION WE'RE

1491
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
GETTING, JOHN KING REPORTING 27

1492
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
IN THIS MASS SHOOTING IN

1494
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1495
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
WE JUST GOT THIS REACTION IN

1496
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
FROM A FATHER AND A SON WHO WERE

1497
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
ON THE SCENE, THE FATHER

1498
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
OBVIOUSLY WAS RUSHING THERE AND

1499
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
PANICKED.

1500
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
WATCH THIS.

1501
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
WE DON'T HAVE IT YET.

1502
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
BUT WE'RE GOING TO GET IT READY

1503
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
FOR OUR VIEWERS.

1504
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
MORE REACTION COMING IN, RONALD

1505
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
STEVENS STILL WITH US, THE

1506
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE

1507
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
NATIONAL SCHOOL SAFETY CENTER.

1508
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
RONALD, IS THERE ANY ADVICE YOU

1509
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
WANT TO GIVE TO PARENTS WHO ARE

1510
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
WATCHING RIGHT NOW?

1511
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
BECAUSE KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL ALL

1512
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
OVER THE COUNTRY.

1513
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
>> WELL, I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE

1514
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
PARENTS TO TELL THEIR CHILDREN

1515
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
THAT THEY LOVE THEM, SPEND SOME

1516
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
TIME WITH THEM, TRY TO OFFER

1517
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
SOME FORM OF COMFORT, AND JUST

1518
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
REALIZE HOW PRECIOUS THEY ARE.

1519
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I KNOW FROM MY OWN PERSPECTIVE

1520
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
THIS MORNING I SAW THREE OF MY

1521
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
GRANDCHILDREN BETWEEN THE SAME

1522
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
AGES, 5 TO 9 OR 10, IN SCHOOL GO

1523
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
AWAY.
IT IS A PARENT'S AND

1524
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
ADMINISTRATOR'S WORST NIGHTMARE.
THE ADMINISTRATORS SAY THEY

1525
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN

1526
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
HERE, WHO EXPERIENCED THIS.

1527
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
AND PARENTS JUST DON'T THINK IT

1528
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
COULD HAPPEN IN THEIR

1529
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
COMMUNITIES.
BUT THIS IS A VIVID REMINDER OF

1530
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
WHERE OUR SOCIETY IS TODAY.

1531
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
>> WE'RE NOW TOLD THE PRESIDENT

1532
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000

1533
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000

00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000

00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000

1538
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000

IN CONNECTICUT.

1540
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
LISTEN TO THIS CLIP.

1541
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
WE JUST GOT IT IN, A FATHER AND

1542
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
SON AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

1543
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1544
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
>> IT WAS TERRIFYING.

1545
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I'M STILL TERRIFIED.
I THINK I'M IN SHOCK ABOUT IT

1546
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
ALL.
I STILL DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING

1547
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
THAT HAPPENED.

1548
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I KNOW THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE
MISSING, THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO

1549
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
THE HOSPITAL.

1550
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYONE HAS

1551
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR.

1552
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
IT IS TERRIFYING.

1553
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
YOU KNOW, THE -- YOU RUSH OVER

1554
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
HERE, AND YOU CAN'T GET TO WHERE

1555
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
YOU NEED TO GO AND YOU HAVE TO

1556
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
PARK DOWN HERE AND WALK.

1557
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I'M GLAD MY SON IS OKAY.

1558
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
HE SEEMS TO BE HANDLING IT

1559
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW.

1560
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I KNOW MY SON'S TEACHERS HAVE

1561
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
BEEN OKAY AS WELL.

1562
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
BUT I'VE HEARD OTHER TEACHERS

1563
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000

1564
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000

DEAD, THAT NUMBER POTENTIALLY

1567
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
COULD CHANGE.

1568
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
18 TO 20, WE'RE TOLD, CHILDREN.

1569

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
SCHOOL.
HE WAS NOT RUNNING IN THE HALLS.

1639
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
WE'RE GETTING NEW INFORMATION.

1640
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES HAS SPOKEN

1641
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000

1642
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
HE HAS SPOKEN WITH THE GOVERNOR

1643
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
OF CONNECTICUT.

1644
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
HE MAY BE SPEAKING SHORTLY.

1645
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
WANT TO TAKE YOU TO OUR CHIEF

1646
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT

1647
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
JESSICA YELLIN STANDING BY.

1648
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
JESSICA, DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA IF

1649
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT WILL

1650
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
SPEAK?
>> HI, BROOKE, YES.

1651
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS GOING TO

1652
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
SPEAK AT 3:15 P.M. EASTERN TIME.

1653
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
THAT'S ABOUT 25 MINUTES FROM

1654
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
NOW.
HE WILL COME TO THE PRESS

1655
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
BRIEFING ROOM IN THE WHITE HOUSE

1656
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
AND ADDRESS CAMERAS.

1657
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
AND, YOU KNOW, THIS IS ONE OF

1658
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
THE TIMES WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS

1659
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
REALLY ABLE TO REALLY TOUCH A

1660
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
CHORD.
YOU KNOW HE SPOKE VERY MOVINGLY

1661
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
AFTER THE SHOOTINGS AROUND GABBY

1662
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
GIFFORDS, THE ATTACK ON GABBY

1663
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
GIFFORDS AND SO MANY PEOPLE ON

1664
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
HER STAFF, WHEN HE SAID AT THAT

1665
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
TIME, REMEMBER, IT IS PART OF

1666
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
OUR NATURE TO DEMAND AN

1667
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
EXPLANATI

1668
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
EXPLANATION.

1669
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
HE SAID AT THAT TIME, BAD THINGS
HAPPEN.

1670
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
WE HAVE TO GUARD AGAINST SIMPLE

1671
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
EXPLANATIONS IN THE AFTERMATH.

1672
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
ALREADY TODAY, THE WHITE HOUSE

1673
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
PRESS SECRETARY JAY CARNEY MADE

1674
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT A TIME TO

1675
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
TALK ABOUT POLITICAL AND POLICY

1676
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
RESPONSES, BUT THINK ABOUT THE

1677
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
FAMILIES AND HOW THEY ARE

1678
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
REACTING, HOW THEY FEEL IN THE

1679
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
AFTERMATH AND I EXPECT THAT'S

1680
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
WHAT THE PRESIDENT WILL ADDRESS,

1681
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
BOTH THE FEDERAL RESPONSE,

1682
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
FEDERAL HELP, THE LAW

1683
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
ENFORCEMENT, AND HOW THE NATION

1684
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
WILL COME TOGETHER TO HELP THOSE

1685
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
FAMILIES HEAL.

1686
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
BROOKE?

1687
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
>> JESSICA YELLIN, WE'LL WAIT

1688
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
AND WATCH FOR THE PRESIDENT TO

1689
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
SPEAK THERE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

1690
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
BRIEFING ROOM IN JUST ABOUT 25

1691
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
MINUTES FROM NOW.

1692
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
AND, WOLF BLITZER, BACK TO YOU,

1693
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
BUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT JAY

1694
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
CARNEY SAID EARLIER TODAY,

1695
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
VIS-A-VIS THE PRESIDENT, THE

1696
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
PRESIDENT HAS TWO YOUNG

1697
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
DAUGHTERS, HE'S SYMPATHETIC TO

1698
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
THESE PARENTS WHO, I'M SURE, ARE

1699
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
JUST ABSOLUTELY REELING RIGHT
NOW.

1700
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
>> YEAH.

1701
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
HE SAYS THOSE TWO YOUNG

1702
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
DAUGHTERS OF HIS, SASHA AND

1703
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
MALIA, TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY LIKE

1704
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
MILLIONS OF OTHER PARENTS DO

1705
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
EVERY DAY, THEY DON'T EXPECT

1706
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN CONNECTICUT

1707
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
TO UNFOLD.

1708
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
IT IS A SHOCKING, SHOCKING STORY

1709
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
THAT WE'RE WATCHING.

1710
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
ONCE AGAIN, 3:15, 20 MINUTES OR

1711
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
SO FROM NOW, 3:15 P.M. EASTERN,

1712
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE IN THE

1713
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
BRIEFING ROOM, MAKING A

1714
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
STATEMENT TO THE NATION.

1715
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
JOINING US NOW ON THE PHONE IS

1716
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
RABBI PRAVER, A RABBI IN THE

1717
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
AREA IN CONNECTICUT.

1718
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
YOU'RE AT THE FIREHOUSE WHERE

1719
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
PARENTS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT.

1720
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
IS THAT RIGHT?

1721
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
TELL US WHAT IS GOING ON THERE.

1722
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
>> OKAY, WE'RE ALL GATHERED HERE

1723
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
AT THE FIREHOUSE.

1724
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
FIRST, WE WERE SPEAKING WITH THE

1725
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
TEACHERS TO TAFIND OUT THE

1726
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
STUDENTS WHO WERE ABSENT, NOT

1727
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
ABSENT, AND THERE IS ANOTHER

1728
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
ROOM WHERE THERE ARE PARENTS

1729
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
WHOSE CHILDREN WERE TAKEN TO THE

1730
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
HOSPITAL AFTER THE SHOOTING.

1731
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
AND THEY'RE WAITING FOR THE

1732
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
GOVERNOR TO RETURN TO PROVIDE

1733
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR

1734
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
CONDITION.

1735
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
>> HAS THE GOVERNOR BEEN INSIDE

1736
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
THAT FIREHOUSE WITH YOU,

1737
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
SPEAKING TO PARENTS?

1738
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
>> YES.

1739
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
THE GOVERNOR WAS WITH US AND IS

1740
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
COMING BACK AT 3:00.

1741
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
>> THESE ARE PARENTS WHO MAY

1742
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
HAVE LOST THEIR CHILDREN, WHO

1743
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THIS

1744
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
INCIDENT.
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE --

1745
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
>> YES, THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

1746
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
THEIR CHILDREN WERE TAKEN TO A

1747
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
HOSPITAL, AND THERE IS A CERTAIN

1748
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
AMOUNT OF CHILDREN TAKEN TO THE

1749
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
HOSPITALS AND A CERTAIN AMOUNT

1750
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
ALREADY, I THINK, MIGHT, WELL, I

1751
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
DON'T THINK THEY KNOW

1752
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
CONCLUSIVELY, BUT MANY OF THEM

1753
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
SUSPECT, YOU KNOW, THAT THEIR

1754
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
CHILDREN WERE VICTIMS, BUT WE'RE

1755
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
JUST HOLDING OUT HOPE THAT THE

1756
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
INJURED WILL, YOU KNOW, BE OKAY.

1757
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
>> RABBI PRAVER, STAND BY FOR A

1758
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
MOMENT.

1759
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
MARY SNOW IS OUTSIDE THE

1760
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
SUSPECT'S HOME, WE'RE TOLD, RYAN

1761
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
LANZA.
MARY, TELL US WHAT YOU'RE

1762
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
LEARNING.
>> WELL, WOLF, IT IS AN ACTIVE

1763
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
CRIME SCENE AND THERE IS MORE

1764
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
THAN A DOZEN LAW ENFORCEMENT

1765
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
VEHICLES HERE.

1766
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
WE'RE BEING KEPT BACK FROM THE

1767
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
HOME.
IT IS CORDONED OFF.

1768
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
WE DID SEE AN AMBULANCE LEAVE

1769
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
THIS SCENE ABOUT 15 MINUTES AGO.

1770
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
AND NEIGHBORS HAVE BEEN TOLD

1771
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
TO -- THAT THEY CAN'T GO BACK

1772
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
INTO THEIR HOMES.

1773
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
ONE NEIGHBOR I SPOKE WITH SAID

1774
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
THAT AROUND 11:00, POLICE CAME

1775
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
AND TOLD HER TO EVACUATE RIGHT

1776
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
AWAY.
SHE SAID SHE WAS BACK AN HOUR

1777
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
LATER, WHERE POLICE ESCORTED HER

1778
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
TO HER HOME, BUT SHE WAS TOLD

1779
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
AGAIN TO LEAVE AND THERE IS NO

1780
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
INDICATION OF WHEN THESE

1781
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
RESIDENTS ARE GOING TO BE

1782
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
ALLOWED BACK INTO THEIR HOME, IN

1783
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
TERMS OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING

1784
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
ABOUT THE LANZAS, I ONLY FOUND

1785
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
ONE NEIGHBOR SO FAR WHO KNOWS OF

1786
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
THE FAMILY.

1787
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
SHE DID NOT WANT TO BE NAMED BUT

1788
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
THE ONLY THING SHE WOULD TELL ME

1789
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
IS THAT THERE WERE TWO BROTHERS,

1790
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
AND SHE DESCRIBED THEM AS

1791
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
TROUBLED.
BUT DIDN'T WANT TO GO ANY

1792
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
FURTHER THAN THAT.

1793
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
BUT THAT IS THE SCENE.

1794
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
AND IT IS A BEAUTIFUL NEW

1795
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
ENGLAND TOWN, VERY QUIET ROAD.

1796
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
THE HOUSES ARE SET APART FROM

1797
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
ONE ANOTHER.
AND RIGHT NOW THERE IS YELLOW

1798
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
POLICE TAPE, BUT IT IS BLOCKING

1799
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
ANYONE FROM GOING THROUGH.

1800
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES

1801
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
AND POLICE ARE STANDING GUARD

1802
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
PREVENTING ANYBODY FROM GETTING

1803
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
ANY FURTHER TO THE HOUSE.

1804
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
>> NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, IS A

1805
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
POPULATION OF UNDER 2,000

1806
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
PEOPLE.
IT IS LOCATED IN FAIRFIELD

1807
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
COUNTY, 45 MILES SOUTHWEST OF

1808
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
HARTFORD, ABOUT 80 MILES

1809
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
NORTHEAST OF NEW YORK CITY.

1810
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
MARY, WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

1811
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
THE SUSPECT -- THE SUSPECTED

GUNMAN, RYAN LANZA, IN HIS 20s,

1813
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
HE DIED AT THE SCENE.

1814
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
WE DON'T KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

1815
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
WE'LL BE GETTING MORE

1816
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000

1843
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000

TARGETS.

1852
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
IF YOU WANT TO COMMIT A CRIME

1853
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000

1854
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000

01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
THAT BACK.
WE HAVE TO EDUCATE THE TEACHERS.

1864
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
WE ALL -- ALL OF OUR

1865
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000

1866
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, HOWEVER

1867
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
WHEN IT HAPPENS, IT IS BEYOND

1868
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
COMPREHENSION.
WE HAVE TO TRAIN OUR TEACHERS TO

1869
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
BE ABLE TO DIRECT THE CHILDREN,

1870
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
ESPECIALLY AT THIS AGE, DIRECT

1871
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
THEM AND TELL THEM WHAT TO DO

1872
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T ACT ON THEIR

1873
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
OWN.
THEY ARE DEFENSELESS AGAINST

1874
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1875
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
IT IS THE ADULTS THAT HAVE TO

1876
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000

1877
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM, LAW

1879
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
GO BEYOND THE EDUCATION

01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
DEPARTMENT TO THE PRESIDENT'S

01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
PLANTED IN PEOPLE'S HEADS AND

01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
WHY THEY'RE DOING THIS.

1885
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
>> STEVE HARDY, STAND BY.

1886
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000

01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
JOINING US.

1999
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
MARY IS OUTSIDE THE SUSPECT'S

2000
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
HOME THERE.
WE'RE GETTING THE FIRST IMAGES

2001
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
NOW FROM THAT HOME.

2002
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
MARY, UPDATE OUR VIEWERS ON WHAT

2003
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000

2004
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,000

>> WOLF, WE ARE ON THE ROAD

2006
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
WHERE THE LANZA HOME IS LOCATED

2007
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
AND AS YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE

2008
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
THERE ARE POLICE LINES BEHIND

2009
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
ME.
POLICE ARE KEEPING RESIDENTS

2010
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
OUT, REPORTERS OUT.

2011
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
THERE ARE MORE THAN A DOZEN LAW

2012
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES HERE.

2013
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
WE DID SEE AN AMBULANCE LEAVING

2014
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
THE SCENE ABOUT 15 MINUTES AGO.

2015
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
AND WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU FROM

2016
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
NEIGHBORS IS THIS, THEY SAY THAT

2017
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
ABOUT 11:00, ONE NEIGHBOR TOLD

2018
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
US POLICE CAME AND TOLD HER THAT

2019
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
THEY HAD TO EVACUATE RIGHT AWAY,

2020
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
LEFT THEIR HOME, SOME PEOPLE

2021
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE ESCORTED

2022
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
BACK TO THEIR HOMES, BUT THEN

2023
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
LEAVING AGAIN.

2024
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
THIS IS AN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE,

2025
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
UNCLEAR WHEN RESIDENTS WILL BE

2026
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
ABLE TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES.

2027
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
IN TERMS OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE

2028
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
SAYING ABOUT RYAN LANZA, TALKED

2029
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
TO SEVERAL PEOPLE HERE WHO LIVE

2030
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
IN THE AREA, THEY SAID THEY WERE

2031
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
UNFAMILIAR WITH THE --

2032
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
>> WE JUST LOST OUR CONNECTION

2033
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
WITH MARY SNOW.

2034
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
BUT WE'LL RECONNECT WITH HER.

2035
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
DAVID ARIOSO, ONE OF OUR CNN

2036
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
PRODUCERS, IS ALSO ON THE SCENE.

2037
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
DAVID, WHERE EXACTLY ARE YOU IN

2038
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
NEWTOWN?

2039
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
>> WOLF, I'M STANDING DIRECTLY

2040
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
IN FRONT OF THE FIREHOUSE RIGHT

2041
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
NOW.
AND THAT'S BEEN ESSENTIALLY USED

2042
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
AS SORT OF A MAKESHIFT HOLDING

2043
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
PLACE.

2044
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
FOR A LOT OF THESE FAMILIES AND

2045
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
CHILDREN AND PARENTS WHO

2046
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
ESSENTIALLY JUST ARE TRYING TO

2047
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
COPE WITH WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED, I

2048
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
CAN COUNT PROBABLY AT LEAST HALF

2049
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
A DOZEN EMERGENCY VEHICLES.

2050
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
SO IT IS STILL VERY ACTIVE SCENE

2051
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
DOWN HERE.

2052
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
HELICOPTERS FLYING OVERHEAD,

2053
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
FBI, ATF AND LOCAL AND STATE

2054
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
OFFICIALS ARE ALL ON SCENE AS IS

2055
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
THE MEDIA HERE, AS FAMILIES WALK

2056
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
OUT.
MANY PEOPLE TRIED TO SPEAK WITH

2057
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
THEM, BUT MANY ARE JUST

2058
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
INCONSOLABLE.
YOU SEE PEOPLE WALKING OUT,

2059
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
PARENTS CLUTCHING THEIR

2060
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
CHILDREN, TEARS IN THEIR EYES,

2061
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
SPEAKING ON CELL PHONES AND JUST

2062
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
TRYING TO CONVEY THE GRAVITY OF

2063
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
THE SITUATION HERE.

2064
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

2065
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
SPEAK WITH A LOCAL TEACHER, NOT

2066
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
A TEACHER AT THE ELEMENTARY

2067
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
SCHOOL WHERE THE SHOOTING TOOK

2068
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
PLACE, BUT IN THE NEARBY SCHOOL

2069
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
SYSTEM AND SHE SAID THE PEOPLE

2070
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
MOVE HERE, OFTEN FOR THE

2071
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
SCHOOLS, SO YOU HAVE PEOPLE

2072
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
COMING FROM IN AND AROUND THE

2073
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
STATE, FOR THE QUALITY OF THE

2074
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
EDUCATION THAT STUDENTS GET IN

2075
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
THIS AREA.
AND SO IT BECAME SUCH A SHOCK

2076
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,000
WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS

2077
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
TRANSPIRE.

2078
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
IT IS -- IT LEAVES YOU AT A LOSS

2079
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
FOR WORDS, BOTH WHAT SHE SAID

2080
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
AND IN MY OWN REPORTING HERE,

2081
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000

ADULTS ARE HERE, SO YOU HAVE

2177
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
PARENTS AND THEN THEIR PARENTS

2178
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
ARE WITH THEM, SUPPORTING THEM.

2179
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,000
SO THERE IS AT LEAST 30, PERHAPS

2180
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
EVEN MORE THERE.

2181
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY, YOU KNOW,

2182
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
WHO IS AWAITING THE NEWS AND WHO

2183
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
IS THERE AS A FRIEND, SO IT IS

2184
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
HARD TO GIVE A PRECISE NUMBER.

2185
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
BUT THE ROOM IS PRETTY FULL.

2186
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
>> AND THEY'RE GETTING THE

2187
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM

2188
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
GOVERNOR MALLOY?

2189
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
>> I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW THAT

2190
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
ALL WORKS.

2191
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I JUST KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR

2192
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
BRIEFED US ALL.

2193
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
AND SAID THAT HE WAS GOING TO

2194
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
TELL US AS SOON AS HE FOUND

2195
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
ANYTHING OUT AND THAT HE SAID HE

2196
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
WOULD BE BACK, YOU KNOW, AROUND

2197
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
3:00.
SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS

2198
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
SPECIFICALLY THE GOVERNOR THAT

2199
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
IS PROVIDING ANY INFORMATION OR

2200
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
NOT.

2201
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
>> RABBI PRAVER OF CONGREGATION

2202
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
OF ISRAEL OUT OF NEWTOWN,

2203
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
CONNECTICUT, HE'S IN THAT
FIREHOUSE, HE'S TRYING TO

2204
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
CONSOLE SOME OF THESE PARENTS

2205
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
WHO MAY HAVE LOST CHILDREN IN

2206
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
THIS MASS SHOOTING TODAY AT THE

2207
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN

2208
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

2209
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
RABBI, WE'LL CONTINUE OUR

2210
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
CONVERSATION.

2211
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
WHAT A PAINFUL CONVERSATION IT

2212
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
IS.

2213
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I'M SURE IT MUST BE SO PAINFUL

2214
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
FOR YOU TO BE WITH THESE FAMILY

2215
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
MEMBERS, WITH THESE PARENTS OF

2216
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
CHILDREN WHO MAY HAVE BEEN

2217
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
KILLED IN THIS MASS MURDER.

2218
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO CALL IT.

2219
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI IS ON THE SCENE

2220
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
FOR US AS WELL.

2221
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
SUSAN, ARE YOU GETTING MORE

2222
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
INFORMATION ON WHAT HAPPENED?

2223
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
>> YES, WOLF.

2224
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I HAVE SOME NEW INFORMATION TO

2225
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
REPORT NOW FROM TWO LAW

2226
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
ENFORCEMENT SOURCES THAT AMONG

2227
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
THE DEAD IS THE MOTHER OF THE

2228
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
SHOOTER IN THIS CASE.

2229
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
THE MOTHER OF THE SHOOTER IS

2230
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
ALSO DEAD.

2231
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
SHE IS A TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL.

2232
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
NOW, WE DON'T HAVE CONFIRMED

2233
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
WHETHER SHE WAS FOUND DEAD AT

2234
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
THE SCHOOL, OR AT SOME OTHER

2235
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
LOCATION.

2236
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
BUT TWO SOURCES TELL US THAT

2237
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
SHE, TOO, IS AMONG THE DEAD.

2238
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
ALSO SOME ADDITIONAL NEW

2239
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
INFORMATION TO REPORT TO YOU,

2240
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
WOLF, IS THAT THE SHOOTER, RYAN

2241
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
LANZA, IS 24 YEARS OLD, 24 YEARS

2242
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
OLD.

2243
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
TO REMIND OUR VIEWERS.

2244
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
HE WAS FOUND DEAD AT THE SCENE,

2245
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
IN A CLASSROOM.

2246
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
AND ADDITIONALLY HE WAS FOUND

2247
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
WITH AT LEAST TWO WEAPONS.

2248
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I AM HEARING THERE MAY BE EVEN

2249
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
MORE WEAPONS THAT WERE FOUND.

2250
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
AND ALSO AS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY

2251
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
REPORTED, ANOTHER PERSON IS

2252
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
BEING QUESTIONED BY POLICE IN

2253
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
CONNECTION WITH THIS SHOOTING,

2254
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
BUT WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL

2255
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
INFORMATION ON THAT AT THIS TIME

2256
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
TO REPORT.

2257
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
WOLF?
>> IS THE WORKING ASSUMPTION,

2258
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
AND I KNOW THIS INFORMATION IS

2259
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
PRELIMINARY, SUBJECT TO CHANGE,

2260
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
IS THE WORKING ASSUMPTION THERE

2261
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT, SUSAN,

2262
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
THAT RYAN LANZA, AFTER OPENING

2263
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
FIRE, KILLING ALL THESE PEOPLE,

2264
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
TOOK HIS OWN LIFE?

2265
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
>> Reporter: THAT IS THE WORKING

2266
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
ASSUMPTION HERE.
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT CONFIRMED

2267
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
INFORMATION THAT HE TOOK HIS OWN

2268
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
LIFE.
BUT THAT CERTAINLY IS THE

2269
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
WORKING THEORY HERE.

2270
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
AND SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF PIECES

2271
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
TO PUT TOGETHER.

2272
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
WE ALSO KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT

2273
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN EXECUTING

2274
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
A SEARCH WARRANT AT RYAN LANZA'S

2275
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
HOME.
AND THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THAT

2276
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW.

2277
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
WE HAVE NO INFORMATION YET ABOUT

2278
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION THEY

2279
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
HAVE FOUND.

2280
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
FOR EXAMPLE, HAD THEY FOUND ANY

2281
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
ADDITIONAL WEAPONS AT THE HOUSE.

2282
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
IT IS VERY LIKELY IF HE HAD A

2283
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
COMPUTER THERE, THEY CERTAINLY

2284
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
WOULD HAVE SEIZED THAT AND THE

2285
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
HARD DRIVE AND WOULD BE HARD AT

2286
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
WORK EXAMINING THAT.

2287
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
SO COMMON THAT SO MANY OF US

2288
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
HAVE COMPUTERS THESE DAYS.

2289
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
AND SO WE'RE WAITING FOR ANOTHER

2290
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
UPDATE, WE HOPE TO GET MORE

2291
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
INFORMATION.
OF COURSE, IN THE COMING

2292
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
MINUTES, HOURS, WE'LL HAVE TO

2293
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
SEE.
AND AS YOU KNOW, THE GOVERNOR

2294
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
WILL ALSO BE HOLDING A NEWS

2295
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
CONFERENCE, SCHEDULED IN LESS

2296
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
THAN AN HOUR FROM NOW, EXPECTED

2297
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
TO HAPPEN AROUND 3:30 OR SO,

2298
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
WOLF.
>> AND IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES

2299
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
WE'LL BE HEARING FROM PRESIDENT

2300
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
OBAMA AT THE WHITE HOUSE AS

2301
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
WELL.
BUT, SUSAN, QUICKLY, I WANT TO

2302
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
BE PRECISE ON THIS, IS IT YOUR

2303
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
INFORMATION THAT THE SHOOTER,

2304
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
RYAN LANZA, WENT TO THE SCHOOL

2305
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
AND AMONG OTHERS ACTUALLY SHOT

2306
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
HIS OWN MOTHER THERE, THAT SHE

2307
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
IS A TEACHER AT THIS SCHOOL, AND

2308
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
YOU'RE NOW REPORTING SHE WAS

2309
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
SHOT AND KILLED.

2310
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
I ASSUME HE MUST HAVE SHOT HER,

2311
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
BUT CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG.

2312
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
>> Reporter: YOU KNOW, THE ONLY

2313
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
INFORMATION WE HAVE NOW IS THAT

2314
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
HIS MOTHER IS A TEACHER AT THE

2315
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
SCHOOL.

2316
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
AND SHE WAS -- SHE HAS BEEN

2317
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
FOUND DEAD.

2318
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
INTERESTINGLY WE DON'T HAVE OUR

2319
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES TELLING

2320
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
US THAT SHE IS AMONG THE DEAD AT

2321
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
THE SCHOOL.

2322
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
ONLY THAT SHE IS DEAD.

2323
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
>> WHAT A HORRIFIC STORY.

2324
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
SUSAN, I KNOW YOU'LL BE WORKING

2325
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
YOUR SOURCES, GETTING MORE

2326
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
INFORMATION.

2327
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
MARY SNOW IS WORK HER SOURCE.

2328
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
SHE'S OUTSIDE THE SUSPECT'S HOME

2329
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

2330
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
WE'LL CHECK BACK WITH HER.

2331
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
DAVID ARIOSTO, OUR PRODUCER ON

2332
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
THE SCENE, WE'LL CHECK BACK WITH

2333
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
HIM.
I WANT TO GO TO OUR CHIEF WHITE

2334
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT JESSICA

2335
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
YELLIN IN THE WHITE HOUSE

BRIEFING ROOM RIGHT NOW,

2337
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
AWAITING THE PRESIDENT.

2338
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
SET THE SCENE OVER THERE.

2339
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
MOMENTARILY HE'LL BE WALKING

2340
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
OUT, MAKING A STATEMENT,

2341
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
JESSICA.

2342
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT, WOLF.
WE JUST GOT THE TWO-MINUTE

2343
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
WARNING HERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE

2344
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO ENTER THE

2345
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
PRESS BRIEFING ROOM HERE AND

2346
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
ADDRESS THIS SHOOTING.

2347
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
TRAGICALLY WE HAVE ALL TOO MUCH

2348
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
EXPERIENCE OF THE PRESIDENT

2349
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
SPEAKING TO THE NATION AFTER

2350
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
SHOOTING RAMPAGES SUCH AS THIS

2351
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
ONE.
AND IN THESE INSTANCES HE

2352
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
GENERALLY -- HE OFTEN TRIES TO

2353
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
BRING IT TO A PERSONAL LEVEL,

2354
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
TALK ABOUT THAT IT IS LIKE AS A

2355
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
FATHER, TO RELATE TO WHAT -- TO

2356
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
THE EXPERIENCE THAT PARENTS ARE

2357
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
FEELING ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT

2358
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
NOW, WATCHING THIS STORY UNFOLD,

2359
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
AND TRY TO TELL A STORY FROM

2360
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
INSIDE THAT SCHOOL, USUALLY

2361
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
TRIES TO FIND A STORY OF HEROISM

2362
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
IF HE CAN, TO REASSURE THE

2363
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
NATION THAT THERE ARE POSITIVE

2364
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
STORIES OF AMERICAN RESILIENCE,

2365
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
BUT THIS IS SUCH A GRIM DAY, IT

2366
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
IS A HARD ONE FOR THE PRESIDENT,

2367
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
NO DOUBT, AND FOR THE WHITE

2368
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
HOUSE HERE, WOLF.

2369
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
THE PRESIDENT FOUND OUT ABOUT

2370
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
THIS AT 10:30 THIS MORNING FROM

2371
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
HIS DIRECTOR OF HOMELAND

2372
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
SECURITY.
HE'S RECEIVED UPDATES THROUGHOUT

2373
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
THE DAY.

2374
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
HE SPOKE TO THE FBI DIRECTOR, TO

2375
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
THE CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR, AND

2376
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
HAS BEEN BRIEFED CONSISTENTLY.

2377
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS ADMONISHED

2378
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
US NOT TO TALK ABOUT POLICY AND

2379
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
GUN CONTROL ISSUES TODAY.

2380
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
THIS IS A DAY FOR GRIEVING AND

2381
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
CONCERN FOR THE FAMILIES OF

2382
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
THOSE INVOLVED.
AND I EXPECT THE PRESIDENT TO

2383
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
COME OUT HERE AND MAKE SOME

2384
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
BRIEF REMARKS, WOLF, MUCH MORE

2385
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
PERSONAL IN NATURE.

2386
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
WOLF?

2387
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
>> WE JUST HAVE GOTTEN WORD,

2388
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
RELEASE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE,

2389
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS ORDERED

2390
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
ALL FLAGS FLYING AT HALF-STAFF

2391
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE, ALL U.S.

2392
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
INSTITUTIONS, PUBLIC GROUNDS,

2393
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

2394
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
THERE YOU SEE THE FLAG OVER THE

2395
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
WHITE HOUSE FLYING AT HALF-STAFF

2396
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
RIGHT NOW IN HIS ORDER.

2397
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
HE SAYS I ALSO DIRECT THAT THE

2398
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
FLAG SHALL BE FLOWN AT

2399
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
HALF-STAFF FOR THE SAME LENGTH

2400
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
UNTIL DECEMBER 18th, 2012, SAME

2401
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
LENGTH OF TIME AT ALL U.S.

2402
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
EMBASSIES.

2403
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
HERE IS THE PRESIDENT.
>> I OFFERED GOVERNOR MALLOY MY

2404
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
CONDOLENCES ON BEHALF OF THE

2405
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
NATION.

2406
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
AND MADE IT CLEAR HE WILL HAVE

2407
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
EVERY SINGLE RESOURCE THAT HE

2408
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THIS

2409
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
HEINOUS CRIME, CARE FOR THE

2410
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
VICTIMS, COUNSEL THEIR FAMILIES.

2411
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
WE HAVE ENDURED TOO MANY OF

2412
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
THESE TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST FEW

2413
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
YEARS.
AND EACH TIME I LEARN THE NEWS,

2414
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I REACT NOT AS A PRESIDENT, BUT

2415
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,000
AS ANYBODY ELSE WOULD, AS A

2416
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
PARENT.
AND THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE

2417
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
TODAY.

2418
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I KNOW THERE IS NOT A PARENT IN

2419
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

2420
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I

2421
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
DO.
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

2422
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

2423
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

2424
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

2425
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

2426
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
AHEAD OF THEM, BIRTHDAYS,

2427
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,000
GRADUATIONS, WEDDINGS, KIDS OF

2428
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,000
THEIR OWN.

2429
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

2430
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
TEACHERS, MEN AND WOMEN WHO

2431
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING

2432
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
OUR CHILDREN FULFILL THEIR

2433
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,000
DREAMS.
SO OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY

2434
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
FOR THE PARENTS AND

2435
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
GRANDPARENTS, SISTERS AND

2436
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE

2437
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
CHILDREN, AND FOR THE FAMILIES

2438
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,000
OF THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST.

2439
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

2440
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
PARENTS OF THE SURVIVORS AS
WELL.

2441
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
FOR AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE TO

2442
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

2443
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
TONIGHT, THEY KNOW THAT THEIR

2444
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN

2445
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY.

2446
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
AND THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT WILL

2447
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
EASE THEIR PAIN.

2448
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
AS A COUNTRY WE HAVE BEEN

2449
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
THROUGH THIS TOO MANY TIMES.

2450
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
WHETHER IT IS AN ELEMENTARY

2451
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN, OR A SHOPPING

2452
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
MALL IN OREGON, OR A TEMPLE IN

2453
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
WISCONSIN, OR A MOVIE THEATER IN

2454
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
AURORA OR A STREET CORNER IN

2455
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
CHICAGO, THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE

2456
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THESE

2457
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
CHILDREN ARE OUR CHILDREN.

2458
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME

2459
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
TOGETHER AND TAKE MEANINGFUL

2460
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
ACTION TO PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES

2461
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
LIKE THIS, REGARDLESS OF THE

2462
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
POLITICS.

2463
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
THIS EVENING MICHELLE AND I WILL

2464
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
DO WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT IN

2465
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
AMERICA WILL DO, WHICH IS HUG

2466
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
OUR CHILDREN A LITTLE TIGHTER,

2467
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
AND WE'LL TELL THEM THAT WE LOVE

2468
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
THEM, AND WE'LL REMIND EACH

2469
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
OTHER HOW DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE

2470
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
ANOTHER.
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

2471
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CANNOT DO THAT

2472
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
TONIGHT AND THEY NEED ALL OF US

2473
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
RIGHT NOW.

2474
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
IN THE HARD DAYS TO COME, THE

2475
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
COMMUNITY NEEDS US TO BE AT OUR

2476
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
BEST AS AMERICANS, AND I WILL DO

2477
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER AS

2478
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
PRESIDENT TO HELP.

2479
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
BECAUSE WHILE NOTHING CAN FILL

2480
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
THE SPACE OF A LOST CHILD OR

2481
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
LOVED ONE, ALL OF US CAN EXTEND

2482
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
THE HAND TO THOSE IN NEED, TO

2483
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
REMIND THEM THAT WE ARE THERE

2484
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
FOR THEM, THAT WE ARE PRAYING

2485
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
FOR THEM, THAT THE LOVE THEY

2486
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
FELT FOR THOSE THEY LOST ENDURES

2487
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
NOT JUST IN THEIR MEMORIES, BUT

2488
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
ALSO IN OURS.

2489
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF THE

2490
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
VICTIMS AND IN THE WORDS OF

2491
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
SCRIPTURE, HEAL THE

2492
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
BROKEN-HEARTED AND BIND UP THEIR

2493
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:54,000
WOUNDS.

2494
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
>> VERY, VERY EMOTIONAL MOMENT

2495
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

2496
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
STATES.

2497
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
DARE I SAY FOR ALL OF AMERICA.

2498
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
MUCH OF THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.

2499
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
YOU DON'T OFTEN SEE THE

2500
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

2501
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
SHOWING SUCH EMOTION, WIPING

2502
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
AWAY TEARS AS HE SPEAKS OF THESE

2503
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
LITTLE KIDS, 5 TO 10-YEAR-OLD

2504
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
KIDS, THE MAJORITY OF THE

2505
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
VICTIMS WHO WERE KILLED IN THIS

2506
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
MASS SHOOTING IN CONNECTICUT

2507
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
TODAY.
GOT TO TELL YOU, I COVERED A LOT

2508
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
OF PRESIDENTS, I HAVEN'T SEEN A

2509
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
PRESIDENT EMERGE AS EMOTIONALLY

2510
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
CHARGED AND THIS IS A PRESIDENT

2511
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
WHO HAS TWO DAUGHTERS, HE SENDS

2512
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY, LIKE

2513
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
MILLIONS OF OTHER PARENTS ALL

2514
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
OVER THE COUNTRY, HOW MUCH THEY

2515
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
CAN IDENTIFY WITH WHAT IS GOING

2516
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
ON RIGHT NOW, THIS INSANITY THAT

2517
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
HAS OCCURRED IN THIS SMALL

2518
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN

2519
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
CONNECTICUT.
TODAY, JOHN KING IS JOINING WITH

2520
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
US MORE INFORMATION.

2521
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
WE HAVE COVERED PRESIDENTS, NOT

2522
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
OFTEN -- DARE I SAY, I DON'T

2523
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
REMEMBER A TIME I'VE SEEN A

2524
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
PRESIDENT START LITERALLY CRYING

2525
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
LIKE THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF A

2526
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
MAJOR STATEMENT.

2527
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
>> AS THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF

2528
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
NOTED, WOLF, I THINK HE WAS

2529
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
ADDRESSING THE NATION MORE AS A

2530
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
FATHER THAN AS A PRESIDENT.

2531
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
AND I CAN -- I'VE BEEN TEXTING

2532
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER ALL

2533
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
AFTERNOON.
I GET WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS

2534
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
ABOUT HUGGING YOUR CHILDREN A

2535
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
LITTLE TIGHTER TONIGHT.

2536
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
THIS IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND

2537
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
THAT'S ONE REASON THE PRESIDENT

2538
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
WAS SO SAD, AS HE DELIVERED THAT

2539
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
STATEMENT THERE.
AS WE GET MORE INFORMATION,

2540
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
WOLF, IT BECOMES MORE

2541
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
INCOMPREHENSIBLE.

2542
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,000
I'M TOLD BY FEDERAL LAW

2543
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
ENFORCEMENT SOURCE THAT MOST OF

2544
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
THOSE KILLED WERE KILLED IN THE
CLASSROOM OF THE ALLEGED

2545
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000

01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
CLASSROOM AND, AGAIN THIS IS

01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000

ALLEGED SHOOTER WAS FOUND DEAD

2578
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

2579
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
THE FATHER WHO WAS DIVORCED FROM

2580
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
LANZA'S MOTHER LIVES ELSEWHERE

2581
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000

SO, JOHN, NOW WE'RE LEARNING NOT

2585
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
ONLY WAS THE MOTHER FOUND DEAD,

2586
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
AS YOU'VE BEEN REPORTING INSIDE

2587
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
THE SMALL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, THE

2588
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

2589
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
AND MANY OF THE CHILDREN WERE

2590
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
WHO WERE KILLED WERE IN HER

2591
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
CLASSROOM, SHE WAS A TEACHER AT

2592
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
THIS SCHOOL, BUT THE BROTHER OF

2593
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
THE ALLEGED SHOOTER WAS FOUND

2594
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
DEAD IN A RESIDENTIAL LOCATION

2595
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,000
IN HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY.

2596
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
THIS HAS BEEN OBVIOUSLY VERY,

2597
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
VERY OFF, EVEN MORE AWFUL THAN

2598
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE.

2599
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
>> AND YOU WERE SPEAKING, WOLF,

2600
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I'M SORRY, A SHORT TIME AGO TO

2601
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
THE SCHOOL SECURITY EXPERT WHO

2602
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
PREDICTED SOMETHING SIMILAR TO

2603
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
THIS, SAID AS MORE DETAILS

2604
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
EMERGE, YOU'RE LIKELY TO FIND A

2605
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
PROFILE OF SOMEBODY WHO WAS

2606
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
HAVING A VERY TROUBLED ISSUES IN

2607
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
HIS OR HER FAMILY LIFE.

2608
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
NOW WE KNOW THE SHOOTER, OF

2609
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
COURSE, 24-YEAR-OLD, I BELIEVE,

2610
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
YOUNG MAN, RYAN LANZA, ACCORDING

2611
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
TO POLICE AT THE SCENE AND YOU

2612
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
HAVE FROM TERRY FRIEDEN'S

2613
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
REPORTING, A BROTHER KILLED, HIS

2614
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
MOTHER WAS A TEACHER AT THE

2615
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
SCHOOL, AND IS BELIEVED THAT SHE

2616
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
WAS THE PRIMARY TARGET,

2617
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
ACCORDING TO FEDERAL LAW

2618
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND HE
SHOT HER AND THEN SHOT CHILDREN

2619
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
IN HER CLASSROOM AT THE SCHOOL,

2620
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
MOST OF THE DEATHS I'M TOLD BY

2621
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE

2622
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
OCCURRED THERE IN THAT ONE

2623
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
CONCENTRATED AREA OF THE SCHOOL.

2624
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
AND THE POLICE WILL TRY TO PUT

2625
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
THIS TOGETHER.
AND OBVIOUSLY THERE WILL BE

2626
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
DETAILED INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT

2627
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
THING OR WHAT THINGS MAY HAVE

2628
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
BEEN THE TRIGGER HERE FOR THIS

2629
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
HORRIFIC EVENT.

2630
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
AND THAT IS PART OF THE

2631
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
INVESTIGATIVE DETAIL THAT WE'LL

2632
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
TRY TO PUT TOGETHER, AND IT IS

2633
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
ALWAYS THE BIG QUESTION, THE

2634
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
PRESIDENT JUST ASKED IT QUITE

2635
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
POIGNANTLY AND I THINK PARENTS

2636
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
AROUND THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS

2637
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
ALL THOSE LAW ENFORCEMENT

2638
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
OFFICIALS WERE SHOWING ON OUR

2639
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
SCREENS AT THE SCENE TODAY WILL

2640
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
BE ASKING VERY SHORT QUESTION,

2641
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
WHY.

2642
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
>> WE DON'T KNOW.

2643
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
WE HAVE NO IDEA, THOUGH I

2644
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
SUSPECT WE'LL LEARN A LOT MORE

2645
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
IN THE COMING MINUTES, HOURS AND

2646
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
CERTAINLY DAYS.

2647
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
JOHN, STAND BY.

2648
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
JESSICA YELLIN IS OUR CHIEF

2649
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT.
YOU WERE IN THE BRIEFING ROOM

2650
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
WHEN THE PRESIDENT DELIVERED THE

2651
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
POWERFUL, VERY EMOTIONAL

2652
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
STATEMENT.

2653
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
WE SAW HIM REPEATEDLY PAUSING,

2654
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
TRYING TO CONTROL HIMSELF,

2655
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
WIPING AWAY TEARS AS HE SPOKE TO

2656
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

2657
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
>> WOLF, I'VE SIMPLY NEVER SEEN

2658
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
THE PRESIDENT THAT EMOTIONAL.

2659
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
PUBLICLY HE'S NEVER CRIED LIKE

2660
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
THAT IN MY PRESENCE.

2661
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
HE WAS CONSISTENTLY WIPING AWAY

2662
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
TEARS AS YOU SAY.

2663
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS, HE CALLED

2664
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
THEM, AND POINTED OUT, AGAIN, AS

2665
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
HE ALWAYS DOES, DURING THESE

2666
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
INSTANCES, BUT IT SEEMED TO

2667
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
REALLY HIT HOME FOR HIM HERE,

2668
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
THE WHITE HOUSE, AND FOR SO MANY

2669
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
OF HIS AIDES THAT WE SAW

2670
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
ACTUALLY HOLDING HANDS AND

2671
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
CRYING BY THE SIDE, THAT HE IS A

2672
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
PARENT WHO CAN NOW GO HOME AND

2673
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
HUG HIS CHILDREN TONIGHT, BUT

2674
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
THESE FAMILIES CANNOT.

2675
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT A STORY

2676
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE.

2677
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
BUT WHEN HE SPEAKS AS THE

2678
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
CONSOLAR IN CHIEF, IT IS SORT OF

2679
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT SO MANY

2680
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE

2681
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
EXPERIENCING TONIGHT AND THIS

2682
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
IS, IN A WAY, ONE OF THOSE

2683
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
STORIES THAT WRENCHES EVERYBODY
OUT OF THE MOMENT, OUT OF THE

2684
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
STORIES THAT WE HAVE BEEN

2685
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
COVERING, AND REMINDS US ALL

2686
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
THAT WHATEVER PARTISAN POLITICS

2687
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
WE HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH IN

2688
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
REPORTING ON, THIS IS A TIME TO

2689
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
JUST PAUSE AND APPRECIATE OUR

2690
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
FAMILIES, APPRECIATE WHAT WE DO

2691
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
HAVE, COMFORT THOSE WHO ARE

2692
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW AND GOING

2693
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
THROUGH LOSS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS CLEARLY

2694
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
STRUGGLING TO DO THAT HIMSELF

2695
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE HE IS CLEARLY

2696
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
SHAKEN BY THIS.

2697
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
PERSONALLY.
AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT HE

2698
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
DID MAKE A VEILED REFERENCE TO

2699
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
TRYING TO TAKE SOME ACTION IN

2700
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
THE WAKE OF THIS.

2701
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
HE SAID WHATEVER OUR POLITICS,

2702
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO MAKE

2703
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
SURE THESE TRAGEDIES STOP.

2704
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
WE WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW UP ON

2705
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
ANOTHER TIME TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT

2706
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
THAT MEANS FOR HIM, WOLF.

2707
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
>> AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT

2708
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
THE PRESIDENT IS EMOTIONALLY

2709
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,000
MOVED.
I SUPPOSE HE'S ANXIOUS TO GO TO

2710
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
CONNECTICUT, CONSOLE THE

2711
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
PARENTS.
WE'RE AWAITING WORD FROM THE

2712
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT, DANNEL

2713
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
MALLOY, SPEAKING MOMENTARILY.

2714
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
LET'S TAKE THIS QUICK BREAK.

2715
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000

01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT AS EVIL,

2892
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
THIS IS TRULY IN THAT ZONE.

2893
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
THIS IS PSYCHOPATHY.

2894
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN EVIDENCE

2895
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
THAT THIS WAS A PROBLEMATIC

2896
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
PERSON LONG BEFORE, AND I'M

2897
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
SAYING NOW, WE HAVE TO HELP

2898
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
PEOPLE HELP THEM.

2899
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
WE HAVE TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM

2900
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
DOING THESE THINGS.

2901
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
WE HAVE TO BREAK DOWN PARENTS'

2902
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
DENIALS WHO DON'T WANT TO ADMIT

2903
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
THEIR KID MAY BE -- HAVE

2904
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
TENDENCIES IN THIS DIRECTION.

2905
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
WE MUST TAKE ACTION BEFORE

2906
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
SOMETHING HORRIBLE LIKE THIS

2907
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
HAPPENS.

2908
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
THIS IS NOT LIKE AN OREGON,

2909
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
WHERE THE KID SEEMS OUT OF

2910
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
CONTEXT, DOESN'T SEEM

2911
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
UNDERSTANDABLE.

2912
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A PSYCHOTIC

2913
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
EPISODE.
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOMETHING OF

2914
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
THAT NATURE GOING ON HERE.

2915
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
WE'LL LEARN AS WE GO ALONG, BUT

2916
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
THE PURPOSEFUL, GOAL-DIRECTED

2917
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
NATURE OF THESE ACTIONS SUGGEST

2918
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
SOMETHING FAR WORSE, FAR MORE

2919
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
SINISTER, AND FAR MORE CHRONIC.

2920
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
IN OTHER WORDS, FAR MORE

2921
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
POTENTIALLY PREDICTABLE.

2922
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
LISTEN, I WAS THINKING ABOUT

2923
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
THIS, WOLF, JUST SITTING HERE IN

2924
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
THE CHAIR WAITING TO TALK TO

2925
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
YOU, WHEN WE'RE TREATING -- WHEN

2926
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
WE OPERATE A HOSPITAL OR IN A

2927
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
TREATMENT ENVIRONMENT, WE TRY TO

2928
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
OPERATE LIKE A HEALTHY FAMILY,

2929
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
IN ORDER TO DECREASE THE

2930
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
TENDENCIES FOR THE MOST

2931
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
VULNERABLE AMONGST US, THE ONES

2932
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
WE'RE TRYING TO TREAT FROM

2933
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
ACTING OUT.

2934
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
IT IS TIME FOR OUR GOVERNMENT

2935
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
AND OUR CULTURE TO ACT LIKE A

2936
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
HEALTHY FAMILY.

2937
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
DIVISIVENESS IS STARTING TO HAVE

2938
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
ITS EFFECT AMONGST THE MOST

2939
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
VULNERABLE AMONGST US AND IT IS

2940
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
TIME TO STOP.

2941
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
WE HAVE TO LEAD OUR WAY OUT OF

2942
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
THIS, AND WE NEED OUR LEADERS TO

2943
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
BEHAVE IN A HEALTHY MANNER.

2944
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
>> WE'RE AWAITING, DR. DREW, THE

2945
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT, DANNEL

2946

MALLOY, HE'S BEEN INSIDE THAT

2947
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
FIREHOUSE MEETING WITH PARENTS

2948
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000
WHOSE KIDS WERE KILLED TODAY.

2949
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
FIRST GRADERS, SECOND-GRADERS,

2950
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
THIRD GRADERS AND HE'S ABOUT TO

2951
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
MAKE A STATEMENT THERE, HE'S

2952
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
WALKING UP TO THE MICROPHONE.

2953
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
MOMENTARILY WE'RE TOLD WE'LL

2954
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

2955
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
BUT WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN YOU

2956
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
TELLING US, MAYBE YOU'LL TELL US

2957
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
AFTER WE HEAR FROM THE GOVERNOR,

2958
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
WHAT DO PARENTS TELL THEIR

2959
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
CHILDREN TONIGHT BECAUSE THIS

2960
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
IS -- THESE KINDS OF INCIDENTS,

2961
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED

2962
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
HERE?

2963
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
>> RIGHT.
FEEL FREE TO INTERRUPT ME IF THE

2964
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
GOVERNOR STARTS SPEAKING.

2965
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
THE FACT IS WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO

2966
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
OPERATE HEALTHY WITHIN OUR

2967
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
FAMILIES, WITHIN OUR

2968
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
COMMUNITIES, WITHIN OUR STATES,

2969
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
WITHIN OUR GOVERNMENT.

2970
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
WE HAVE TO START IN OUR FAMILIES

2971
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
AND HELPING KIDS UNDERSTAND THAT

2972
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
THEY'RE LOVED, THEY'RE IN A

2973
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
STABLE ENVIRONMENT, WE'RE

2974
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
COMMITTED TO THEM, AND WE HAVE

2975
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
TO BE COMMITTED TO THEM, WE HAVE

2976
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
TO BE PARENTS, AND THAT THEY ARE

2977
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
SAFE.

2978
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
SOMETIMES YOU MAY PICK --

2979
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
DEPENDING ON THE AGE OF THE

2980
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
CHILD, MAYBE THAT CHILD WILL
WANT TO TAKE ACTION, TAKE

2981
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
SELF-DEFENSE CLASSES, WANT TO DO

2982
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
SOMETHING WHERE THEY CAN FEEL

2983
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
LIKE THEY'RE IN CONTROL OF THEIR

2984
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
ENVIRONMENT.
BUT FUNDAMENTALLY, THE SAFETY

2985
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
AND SECURITY AND THE COMMITMENT

2986
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
TO THE FAMILY NEEDS TO BE

2987
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
REASSURED.

2988
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
IT IS THE HOLIDAY SEASON.

2989
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
WE NEED TO LET THE KIDS HAVE

2990
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
THEIR HOLIDAY SEASON.

2991
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,000
BUT I'M TELLING YOU, WE NEED TO

2992
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
OPERATE ON THE MACRO LEVEL AS

2993
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
WELL AS ON THE INDIVIDUAL FAMILY

2994
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
LEVEL.
WE, AS PARENTS, NEED TO TAKE A

2995
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
PAGE FROM OUR LEADERS --

2996
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
>> HOLD ON.

2997
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
>> LET'S SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO

2998
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
SAY.

2999
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
>> EARLIER TODAY A TRAGEDY OF

3000
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,000
UNSPEAKABLE TERMS PLAYED ITSELF

3001
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,000
OUT IN THIS COMMUNITY.

3002
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND I HAVE

3003
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,000
BEEN SPOKEN TO AND IN AN ATTEMPT

3004
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
WE MIGHT BE PREPARED FOR

3005
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS PLAYING

3006
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
ITSELF OUT IN OUR STATE.

3007
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
YOU CAN NEVER BE PREPARED FOR

3008
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
THIS KIND OF INCIDENT.

3009
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHAT HAS

3010
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
TRANSPIRED AT THAT SCHOOL

3011
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
BUILDING WILL LEAVE A MARK ON

3012
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,000
THIS COMMUNITY AND EVERY FAMILY

3013
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
IMPACTED.
I ONLY ASK THAT ALL OF OUR

3022
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
AFTER I'M DONE SPEAKING, A

3023
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE

3024
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000

EARLIER TODAY, A NUMBER OF OUR

3028
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
CITIZENS, BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN,

3029
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
HAD THEIR LIFE TAKEN AWAY FROM

3030
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
THEM.
AS WELL AS ADULTS WHOSE

3031
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
RESPONSIBILITY IT WAS TO EDUCATE

3032
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
AND SUPERVISE THOSE CHILDREN.

3033
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
THE PERPETRATOR OF THE CRIME IS

3034
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
DEAD.

3035
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,000
AS IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO THE

3036
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
PERPETRATOR LIVED WITH.

3037
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
WITH THAT, I'M GOING TO TURN IT

3038
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
OVER TO PAUL VANCE, WHO WILL

3039
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000

3043
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000

I WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT,

3051
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:03,000

3059
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

3060
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000

01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,000
THE FAMILY MEMBERS, FOR ALL THE

3252
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
RESPONDING, FIRST RESPONDERS, IT

3253
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
IS A TRAGEDY.

3254
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
IT IS A TRAGIC SCENE.

3255
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I WOULD -- WE HAVE BEEN ASKED BY

3256
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
THE FAMILY MEMBERS TO ASK THE

3257
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,000
MEMBERS OF THE PRESS TO RESPECT

3258
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
THEIR PRIVACY, AND TO PLEASE

3259
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
LEAVE THEM ALONE AT THIS TIME.

3260
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
THEY'RE GOING THROUGH A

3261
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,000
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF GRIEF WHICH

3262
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
I'M SURE YOU CAN APPRECIATE.

3263
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I WOULD -- I'VE BEEN ASKED TO

3264
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
ASK YOU THAT, PERSONALLY, BY THE

3265
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,000
FAMILY MEMBERS.
ALL RIGHT?

3266
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I'LL BE BACK IN 60 MINUTES WITH

3267
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
THE LIEUTENANT AND WE'LL ANSWER

3268
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:40,000
ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WE CAN.

3269
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
I DON'T KNOW.

3270
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
>> THE POLICE CHIEF IN NEWTOWN,

3271
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
CONNECTICUT, UPDATING US, GIVING

3272
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000

3273
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
LATEST NUMBERS AND THESE ARE

3274
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,000
AWFUL, AWFUL NUMBERS, 26 PEOPLE

3275
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN,

3276
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
CONNECTICUT, THE SANDY HOOK

3277
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

3278
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
HE SAID ONE OTHER INDIVIDUAL WAS

3279
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
KILLED AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION.

3280
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
WE SUSPECT THAT IS THE LOCATION

3281
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
OF HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY, WHERE

3282
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
THE BROTHER OF THIS SUSPECTED

3283
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
SHOOTER, RYAN LANZA, HAS BEEN

3284
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
FOUND, SO ALTOGETHER 27 ON THE

3285
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
SCENE, 26 THERE, PLUS THE

3286
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
SHOOTER.
ANOTHER PERSON WILL BE 28 DEAD

3287
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
PEOPLE AS A RESULT OF WHAT HAS

3288
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
HAPPENED.

3289
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
20 OF THOSE 26 WHO WERE KILLED,

3290
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
CHILDREN, ACCORDING TO THE

3291
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
POLICE CHIEF THERE IN

3292
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
CONNECTICUT.
WE ALSO HEARD FROM DANNEL

3293
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
MALLOY, THE GOVERNOR OF

3294
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
CONNECTICUT, EARLIER FROM THE

3295
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

3296
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
WHO HELD BACK TEARS AS HE SPOKE,

3297
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
NOT ONLY AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE

3298
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
UNITED STATES, BUT AS A PARENT,

3299
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
AS A FATHER OF TWO GIRLS

3300
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
HIMSELF, HE APPRECIATES AS SO

3301
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DO THE

3302
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
TRAGEDY, THE ENORMITY OF WHAT

3303
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
HAS HAPPENED.

3304
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
DR. DREW PINSKY HAS BEEN

3305
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
LISTENING AND WATCHING.

3306
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
DR. DREW, WHAT CAN WE SAY?

3307
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING

3308
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
WE CAN SAY THAT CAN CONSOLE THE

3309
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
PARENTS WHO HAVE LOST A FIRST

3310
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,000
GRADER OR SECOND-GRADER OR

3311
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
THIRD-GRADER.
20 CHILDREN WERE KILLED, ANOTHER

3312
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
SIX ADULTS INCLUDING A TEACHER,

3313
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
ONE OF THOSE TEACHERS BEING THE

3314
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,000
MOTHER OF THIS SUSPECTED

3315
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
SHOOTER.
>> YEAH, WHEN YOU SAY IT, WOLF,

3316
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,000
IT JUST TAKES YOUR BREATH AWAY.

3317
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
I FEEL -- I'M AFRAID I'LL LOSE

3318
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
MY LUNCH THINKING ABOUT HOW

3319
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
AWFUL IT WOULD JUST BE TO BE ONE

3320
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
OF THOSE PARENTS.

3321
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BE

3322
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
DONE FROM HERE TO HELP THOSE

3323
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
PEOPLE OTHER THAN TO SAY OUR

3324
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
PRAYERS AND TO KEEP THEM IN OUR

3325
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
THOUGHTS.
IT IS THE PEOPLE CLOSE TO THEM

3326
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
THAT ARE GOING TO GET THEM

3327
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
THROUGH THIS.

3328
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
NOT US.

3329
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,000
BUT EACH OF US HAS BEEN AFFECTED

3330
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
BY THIS EXPERIENCE.

3331
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
FRANKLY, WOLF, I'M SORRY, I'M

3332
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
STILL DISAPPOINTED BY OUR

3333
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
LEADERS.
I GENUINELY APPRECIATE PRESIDENT

3334
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
OBAMA'S DISPLAY OF EMOTION, THAT

3335
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
WAS A VERY BIG STEP FORWARD.

3336
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
BUT THEY -- THEY HAVE TO DO WHAT

3337
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
EACH OF US, WHAT I WILL HAVE TO

3338
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,000
DO AS A HEAD OF A HOUSEHOLD

3339
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
TONIGHT IN MY FAMILY, WE NEED

3340
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
THAT FROM OUR LEADERS, TODAY,

3341
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO BE

3342
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
OKAY, THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET

3343
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
ALONG, THAT WE ARE GOING TO

3344
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
MODEL HEALTHY BEHAVIOR GOING

3345
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
FORWARD, AND THAT THIS HAS --

3346
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
THIS WILL STOP.

3347
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,000
WE HAVE HAD A YEAR OF

3348
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
UNCONSCIONABLE VIOLENCE THAT IS

3349
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
ENDING IN A VIOLENT EPISODE

3350
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
THAT, IN MY OPINION, PUTS US IN

3351
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
A NEW PLACE.

3352
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
CLOSE RANGE VIOLENCE AGAINST

3353
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,000
CHILDREN.

3354
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
SOMEBODY WILLFULLY, IN A

3355
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
GOAL-DIRECTED FASHION, THOUGHT

3356
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
THIS WAS AN OKAY BEHAVIOR.

3357
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:36,000
IT IS OKAY TO PUSH SOMEONE ON A

3358
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
SUB

3359
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
WE MUST REQUIRE PEOPLE TO GET

3360
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
HELP IF THEY HAVE ANY TENDENCY

3361
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
TOWARDS VIOLENCE OR TO BE

3362
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
DISCONNECTED FROM REALITY.
THERE IS SUCH A THING AS HEALTHY

3363
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
AND NOT HEALTHY.

3364
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
YOU KNOW, WOLF, I WAS EXPLAINING

3365
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
TO SOMEBODY EARLIER THAT THESE

3366
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
DAYS NO ONE WOULD ALLOW SOMEONE

3367
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
IN THE WORKPLACE OR AT SCHOOL IF

3368
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
THEY WERE HAVING CHEST PAIN AND

3369
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
SHORTNESS OF BREATH OR HAD AN

3370
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
INFECTIOUS ILLNESS.

3371
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF

3372
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,000
THEIR MEDICAL CONDITION.

3373
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
GET A LETTER FROM A DOCTOR IN

3374
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
ORDER TO COME BACK.
WE NEED THE SAME SORT OF

3375
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
ATTENTION TO OUR MENTAL HEALTH

3376
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,000
AND WE NEED TO EACH OF US

3377
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS TO HAVE

3378
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:16,000
HEALTHY FAMILIES TO WHICH WE ARE

3379
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
COMMITTED AND THEN AGAIN ON A

3380
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
MACRO LEVEL, WE NEED OUR LEADERS

3381
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
TO SHOW US THE WAY.

3382
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
SHOW US THE WAY TO A HEALTHIER

3383
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
FUTURE WHERE THIS KIND OF THING

3384
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
IS NOT OKAY AND NOT

3385
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,000
CONTEMPLATED.

3386
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
>> BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE -- SEE

3387
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
THESE HORRIFIC CRIMES UNFOLDING,

3388
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,000
WHETHER AT THE MOVIE THEATER OR

3389
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
HERE, IMMEDIATELY LAW

3390
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
ENFORCEMENT OVER THE YEARS HAS

3391
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,000
ALWAYS SAID TO BE CAREFUL OF

3392
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
COPY CATS.

3393
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM DO YOU, DR.

3394
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,000
DREW, THINK COPY-CATS ARE IN

3395
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
THESE KINDS OF MASS KILLINGS?

3396
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
>> WOLF, I AM SORRY TO SAY I

3397
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,000
THINK IT IS A MAJOR ISSUE.

3398
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,000
AND IT'S A MAJOR ISSUE TODAY

3399
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
ESPECIALLY.
I WAS RIDING ON AN ELEVATOR

3400
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
YESTERDAY NIGHT HERE IN CNN LOS

3401
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,000
ANGELES WITH A SECURITY GUARD

3402
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
WHO LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, YOU

3403
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
KNOW, IN A VERY SORT OF, YOU

3404
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
KNOW, SORROWFUL VOICE, THERE'S

3405
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
GOING TO BE COPY-CATS.

3406
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
I LOOKED AT HIM.

3407
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
IT WAS A GUARD I DIDN'T KNOW.

3408
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
AND I SAID REALLY, ARE WE THERE?

3409
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
THAT'S HOW BAD WE'VE GOTTEN?

3410
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
NOT ONLY WAS HE RIGHT, HE WAS

3411
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
RIGHT AND WE'VE CROSSED OVER

3412
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:22,000
WITH A COPY-CAT INTO SOMETHING

3413
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,000
TRULY EVIL, SOMETHING

3414
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
UNIMAGINABLE, WHERE CHILDREN ARE

3415
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
KILLED AT CLOSE RANGE.

3416
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I CAN'T EVEN SAY THE WORDS.

3417
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES IS BROUGHT TO TEARS BY

3418
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
THIS.
ALL OF US ARE BROUGHT TO TEARS

3419
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
BY IT.

3420
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
EACH OF US HAS TO PAY ATTENTION

3421
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
TODAY, PAY ATTENTION TO OUR

3422
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,000
FAMILIES, PAY ATTENTION TO OUR

3423
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
COMMUNITIES AND START TO SAY NO

3424
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
MORE OF THIS.

3425
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON OUR HEALTH.

3426
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
IF SOMEBODY IS AWARE OF SOMEONE

3427
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
RIGHT NOW WHO'S STRUGGLING, DO

3428
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
NOT BE AFRAID TO ENLIST THE HELP

3429
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,000
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OR MENTAL

3430
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS.

3431
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
THEY ARE NOT THERE TO BE

3432
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,000
PUNITIVE, THEY ARE THERE TO

3433
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
HELP.

3434
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
PEOPLE IN AUTHORITY ARE THERE TO

3435
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
HELP.
YOU NEED -- THEY ARE YOUR

3436
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
FRIEND.
YOU NEED TO USE THEM.

3437
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN IN YOUR

3438
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
COMMUNITY.

3439
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
>> AND, DR. DREW, AS WE TAKE A

3440
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:09,000
LOOK AT WHAT YOU SAY THERE ARE

3441
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
SIGNS, IN THIS SHOOTER'S LIFE

3442
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS IN

3443
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
RECENT MONTHS OR YEARS THERE MAY

3444
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:16,000
HAVE BEEN SIGNS OF EVIL INTENT

3445
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
THAT WERE OBVIOUS TO PEOPLE WHO

3446
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
KNEW HIM, MAYBE CLOSE FAMILY

3447
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
MEMBERS AND OTHERS, AND THIS

3448
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF

3449
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
FOLKS WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING,
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING?

3450
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
>> I'M SUSPICIOUS OF THAT.

3451
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
OF COURSE I DON'T KNOW THIS

3452
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
CASE.
AGAIN, AS I SAID, WOLF, I SPENT

3453
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
A LOT OF TIME IN THE MEDIA

3454
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE.

3455
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SENSE OF

3456
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
ALL THESE THINGS.

3457
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
PART OF LEADING US OUT IS TO SAY

3458
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
WHAT HAPPENED, HOW DO WE MAKE

3459
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,000
SENSE OF THIS.

3460
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
THAT'S GOOD LEADERSHIP.

3461
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
SO WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

3462
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
THIS TODAY AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN.

3463
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
I HAVE NO DIRECT KNOWLEDGE, BUT

3464
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,000
MY SUSPICION IS THIS IS SOMEBODY

3465
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
WHO HAS BEEN STRUGGLING FOR A

3466
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
WHILE AND FOR WHOM PROBABLY

3467
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
THERE WAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

3468
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
DENIAL ON BEHALF OF HIS PARENTS

3469
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,000
OR FAMILY OR EVEN HIS COMMUNITY

3470
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,000
AND THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

3471
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
HISTORIES OF LACK OF EMPATHY FOR

3472
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:10,000
OTHERS, AGGRESSION, CRIMINALITY

3473
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
OF ANY TYPE, THEY NEED TO BE

3474
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:14,000
ADDRESSED IN A COHESIVE,

3475
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
THOROUGH AND A MANNER WITHOUT

3476
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
DENIAL.

3477
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
YOU DON'T PRETEND THAT THINGS

3478
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
ARE DIFFERENT THAN YOU WISH THEY

3479
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
WERE.

3480
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,000
YOU REALLY GO AFTER THESE

3481
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,000
THINGS, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,

3482
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,000
HORRIBLE THINGS CAN HAPPEN.

3483
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
>> WE HAVE THE PICTURE NOW OF

3484
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
THE PRINCIPAL OF THE SANDY HOOK

3485
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THAT WE WANT

3486
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:34,000
TO SHOW OUR VIEWERS.

3487
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI IS ON THE SCENE

3488
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
FOR US AS WELL.

3489
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
SUSAN, A HEART-BREAKING,

3490
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
HEART-WRENCHING STORY UNFOLDING.

3491
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
WHAT A TRAGEDY.

3492
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,000
THERE SHE IS, THE PRINCIPAL AT

3493
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,000
THIS SCHOOL, DAWN HOCHSPRUNG WAS

3494
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
KILLED, SHE WAS ALSO A

3495
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,000
PSYCHOLOGIST AT THIS SMALL

3496
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, KINDERGARTEN

3497
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
THROUGH FOURTH GRADE.

3498
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

3499
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
STATES SAID, 5-YEAR-OLD TO

3500
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
10-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN.
20 OF THEM KILLED NOW ACCORDING

3501
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
TO THE POLICE CHIEF IN NEWTOWN,

3502
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
CONNECTICUT.
26 PEOPLE KILLED ALTOGETHER PLUS

3503
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
THE SHOOTER, THAT MAKES 27.

3504
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
AND ANOTHER PERSON AT A

3505
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
DIFFERENT -- AT A DIFFERENT

3506
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
LOCATION.

3507
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
WE EXPECT IN HOBOKEN, NEW

3508
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
JERSEY.
I WANT TO SHOW OUR VIEWERS SOME

3509
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
OF THE IMAGES OF WHAT HAS

3510
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:24,000
HAPPENED.

3511
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
>> CAR AFTER CAR AFTER CAR, SOME

3512
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
OF THEM WERE FLYING UP PAST MY

3513
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
HOUSE AND COMING BACK AROUND

3514
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
AGAIN AND GOING TO THE SCHOOL.

3515
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
THIS HOUSE IS THREE HOUSES AWAY

3516
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
FROM THE SCHOOL.
>> WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVED THERE,

3517
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF SECURITY

3518
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
TO GUARD AND THERE WERE THREE

3519
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
CHILDREN THAT CAME OUT.

3520
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
ONE OF THEM WAS -- HAD A VERY

3521
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
BLOODY FACE.

3522
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
>> WE IMMEDIATELY JUMPED IN THE

3523
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,000
CAR AND HEADED DOWN HERE, SO

3524
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
THIS IS TROUBLING.

3525
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
IT WAS REALLY KIND OF MAY HEM IN

3526
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
THE ROOM WITH THE KIDS AND THE

3527
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,000
TEACHERS, TRYING TO IDENTIFY

3528
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,000
YOUR KID, MAKING SURE THEY WERE

3529
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
SAFE, FIND OUT WHAT THE

3530
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,000
SITUATION WAS.

3531
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
IT STARTED WITH THE NEIGHBORS

3532
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
AND THE REST OF THEIR FRIENDS AT

3533
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:20,000
SCHOOL AND THAT SORT OF THING.

3534
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
>> WHAT DID YOUR DAUGHTER SAY TO

3535
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
YOU?
>> THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY CRYING.

3536
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
PETRIFIED OF WHAT HAPPENED AND

3537
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
WHAT DID IT MEAN.

3538
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
THEY'RE BOTH OLDER THAN SOME OF

3539
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
THE OTHER KIDS IN THE SCHOOL, SO

3540
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
UNDERSTANDING WHAT HAPPENED.
MY SON WAS IN THE GYM WHEN IT

3541
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
HAPPENED, SO I THINK THAT HE

3542
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,000
HEARD THE GUNSHOTS.

3543
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
>> WE SAW POLICE OFFICERS AND WE

3544
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
HEARD THEM ON THE ROOF AND IN

3545
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,000
OUR BUILDING.

3546
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
>> DID YOU HEAR ANY GUNSHOTS OR

3547
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

3548
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:47,000
>> WELL, POLICE OFFICERS, LIKE

3549
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
THEY WERE KIND OF -- THERE WERE

3550
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
POLICE OFFICERS RIGHT OUT THE

3551
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
DOOR TRYING TO FIND THE GUY.

3552
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
>> IT WAS SHOCKING.

3553
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
I GOT THE CALL AT WORK THIS

3554
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,000
MORNING AND I CAN'T BELIEVE A

3555
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
SMALL TOWN LIKE THIS WOULD EVER

3556
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN.

3557
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
AND TO BE IN AN ELEMENTARY

3558
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
SCHOOL, THAT'S UNHEARD OF.

3559
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
>> IT DOESN'T EVEN SEEM REAL.

3560
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
IT JUST DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT'S

3561
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
EVEN POSSIBLE.

3562
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
IT'S LIKE YOU READ IT IN THE

3563
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
PAPER OR SEE IT IN THE NEWS.

3564
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
YOU'RE LIKE OH, MY GOD, THAT

3565
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
POOR FAMILY.

3566
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING

3567
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
HAPPEN SO CLOSE TO HOME, IT'S

3568
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
LIKE I THINK I'M STILL IN SHOCK.

3569
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
>> I CAN TELL YOU THAT, FIRST OF

3570
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
ALL, OBVIOUSLY OUR HEARTS AND

3571
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
PRAYERS GO OUT TO THE VICTIMS OF

3572
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
THIS TERRIBLE INCIDENT, VERY

3573
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
TRAGIC.

3574
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
OUR POLICE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING

3575
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
CLOSELY WITH THE NEWTOWN POLICE

3576
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
DEPARTMENT.

3577
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,000
WE HAVE MUTUAL AID AGREEMENTS IN

3578
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
PLACE THAT ALLOW US TO PROVIDE

3579
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
ASSETS THEY MAY NOT HAVE, ALONG

3580
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
WITH THE STATE POLICE WHO HAVE

3581
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
TAKEN THE LEAD IN THIS

3582
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
INVESTIGATION.
>> IT'S TERRIFYING.

3583
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
I'M STILL TERRIFIED.

3584
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
I THINK I'M STILL IN SHOCK ABOUT

3585
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,000
IT ALL.

3586
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
>> WAS EVERYBODY CRYING, SCARED,

3587
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
WANTING THEIR PARENTS TO COME

3588
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
GET THEM?

3589
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,000
>> YEAH, THEY WERE.

3590
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,000
AND SOME PEOPLE WERE EVEN

3591
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
LIKE -- THEY GOT A STOMACH ACHE.

3592
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,000
>> THEY WOULDN'T EVEN LET US IN

3593
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,000
THE BUILDING.

3594
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
ALL I CAN SAY IS ONE OF THE COPS

3595
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
SAID IT'S THE WORST THING HE'D

3596
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
EVER SEEN IN HIS ENTIRE CAREER,

3597
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,000
BUT IT WAS WHEN THEY TOLD THE

3598
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
PARENTS.
ALL THESE PARENTS WERE WAITING

3599
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO COME OUT.

3600
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE

3601
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,000
STILL ALIVE.

3602
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
THERE'S 20 PARENTS THAT WERE

3603
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
JUST TOLD THAT THEIR CHILDREN

3604
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
ARE DEAD.

3605
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:16,000
IT WAS AWFUL.

3606
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
>>> THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO

3607
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:29,000
DIED TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

3608
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN
