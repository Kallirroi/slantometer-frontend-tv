WE KNOW ADAM LANZA'S FATHER

ACTUALLY MOVED OUT OF THE HOME

1165
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
IN 2001.

1166
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000

EVERY WEEKEND WITH YOUNG ADAM UP

1168
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000

DYNAMIC.

1172
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
THAT'S WHEN ADAM'S PARENTS

OFFICIALLY GOT DIVORCED AND WHEN

00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
HIS FATHER AND BROTHER, RYAN,

1175
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
STOPPED SEEING ADAM.

1176
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
AND WE FOUND OUT THE DAY AFTER

1177
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
THIS MASSACRE OVER THE WEEKEND,

1178
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000

NOW.

01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
HURT ME OR HIMSELF.

AND HAS THREATENED HER, EVEN

1467
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
PULLED A KNIFE ON HER.

1468
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
SHE CALLED THIS A CRY FOR HELP.

1469
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
ONE THAT WAS IMMEDIATELY ECHOED

1470
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
IN A REMARKABLE WAY BY PARENTS

1471
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, BOTH ONLINE

1472
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000

1473
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
>> I'M AFRAID FOR MY DAUGHTER.

1474
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I'M FEARFUL FOR MY DAUGHTER.

01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN MY SON.

01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
WOULD THIS BE HER THAT I'M

1480

GETTING A PHONE CALL ABOUT?

1481
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
>> Reporter: IT WAS CONNECTICUT
THAT TRIGGERED THIS.

1482
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
YET THESE PARENT'S FEARS

1483
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
CONFLICT WITH ALL EXPERT OPINION

1484
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
ABOUT THE MENTALLY ILL.

1485
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
STATISTICALLY THEY ARE NOT

SHE WAS SHOCKED WHEN IT

GREAT DEAL OF LIGHT ON THE FACTS

ABOUT THIS FAMILY DYNAMIC, THE

1850

GUNS, AS WELL AS WHAT

1851
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
INVESTIGATORS FOUND IN THE LANZA

1852
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
HOME?

1853
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
>> Reporter: WELL, WHAT WE KNOW

1854
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
IS THAT ADAM LANZA ACTUALLY

1855
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
DIDN'T SEE HIS BROTHER, RYAN, OR

1856
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
HIS FATHER PETER FOR TWO YEARS.

1857
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
WE KNOW THOSE GUNS FOUND IN THE

1858
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
HOME WERE PURCHASED OVER THE

1859
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
LAST TWO YEARS, LEGALLY BY

1860
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
ADAM'S MOTHER.

1861
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
AND AS FOR THE COMPUTER THAT

1862
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN LOOKING

1863
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
AT IN THE HOME, IT APPEARS THAT

1864
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
WAS INTENTIONALLY DAMAGED.

1865
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
LIKELY BY ADAM USING EITHER A

1866
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
HAMMER OR A SCREWDRIVER.

1867
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
WHAT INVESTIGATORS WILL

1868
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
EVENTUALLY PULL FROM THAT HARD

1869
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
DRIVE REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

1870
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
>> THANKS TO ABC'S T.J. WINICK

1872
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
MORNING.

1873
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,000
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE THAT.

1874
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,000
>>> IN TERMS OF THE GUNS IN THE

1875
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
FAMILY, IF THE MOM KNEW HE WAS
TROUBLED AND KNEW SHE WAS LOSING

1876
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
CONTROL OF HIM, WHY THEN WOULD

1877
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
YOU LEAVE THE GUNS IN A PLACE

1878
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
THAT HE WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO?

1879
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
BUT WHO KNOWS -- NO ONE KNOWS

1880
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
THE RELATIONSHIP OF THAT NATURE

1881
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
EXCEPT THOSE TWO AND WE'LL NEVER

1882
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
KNOW FROM THEIR MOUTHS WHAT IT

1883
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
WAS.

1884
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
BUT A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
SOME PEOPLE SAY THE SHOOTER

1885
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
SHOULD NOT GET AS MUCH ATTENTION

1886
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
AS THE VICTIMS, BUT IT'S SO

1887
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
NATURAL TO WONDER WHAT LED

1888
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
SOMEONE TO GET THAT DARK AND

1889
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
THAT DAMAGED TO SHOOT UP A

1890
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
CLASSROOM OF KIDS.

1891
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
THOSE ARE FAIR, LOGICAL, NATURAL

1892
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
QUESTIONS TO WONDER ABOUT.

1893
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
>> YOU WANT TO GET INTO HIS HEAD

1894
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
TO MAKE SURE WE PREVENT THIS

1895
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
SORT OF TRAGEDY AGAIN.

1896
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
>>> WE ARE LEARNING EVEN MORE

1897
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
ABOUT GUNMAN ADAM LANZA, AS

1898
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
POLICE STRUGGLE TO FIND A

1899
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
POSSIBLE MOTIVE FOR HIS KILLING
SPREE.

1900
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
THOSE WHO KNEW THE 20-YEAR-OLD

1901
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
DESCRIBE HIM AS TROUBLED AND
INTENSELY SHY.

1902
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
THEY SAY HE BARELY LEFT THE

1903
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
HOUSE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS.

1904
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
FOR YEARS, HIS MOTHER NANCY TOLD

1905
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
FRIENDS ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR

1906
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
PROBLEMS AND WORRIED SHE WAS

1907
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
LOSING CONTROL OF HIM.

1908
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
A FORMER BABYSITTER WAS TOLD,

1909
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
DON'T LET HIM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.

1910
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
>> NEVER GO TO THE BATHROOM OR
TURN YOUR BACK ON HIM.

1911
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
>> SHE HOME SCHOOLED HIM AND

1912
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
EVERYTHING.

1913
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
SO LIKE I SAY, I KNEW HE WAS ON

1914
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
MEDICATION, BUT THAT'S ALL I

1915
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
KNOW.

1916
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,000
>> FRIENDS SAY IT WAS NANCY

1917
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
LANZA WHO TOOK HER SON TO THE

1918
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
FIRING RANGE AND INTRODUCED HIM
TO HIGH POWERED WEAPONS,

1919
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
INCLUDING THE AR-15 RIFLE THAT

1920
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
HE USED TO KILL HIS VICTIMS.

1921
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
>> AS WIDELY EXPECTED, THIS

1922
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
TRAGEDY HAS REIGNITED THE DEBATE

1923
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000

MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

1943
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
HE DIDN'T USE THE WORD GUN

1944

ONCE, BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA

1945
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
PROMISED ACTION.

2019
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
ABOUT THE BAN, THE NUMBER OF

2020

PEOPLE KILLED IN MASS SHOOTINGS

2021
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
DID GO DOWN IN THE YEARS THE BAN

2022
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
WAS IN EFFECT EXCEPT FOR '99.
THAT WAS COLUMBINE, AS WE ALL

2023
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
REMEMBER.
BUT BECAUSE MASS SHOOTINGS ARE

2024
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
RELATIVELY RARE, IT'S DIFFICULT

2025
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
TO TELL WHETHER THIS WAS CAUSED

2026
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
BY THE BAN.

2027
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS GIVEN A LOT OF

2028
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
LIP SERVICE TO GUN CONTROL

2029
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,000
BECAUSE OF THE NATIONAL OUTRAGE.
BUT THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO HAS

2030
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
BEEN MUCH MORE FRIENDLY TO GUN

2031
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
OWNERS THAN GUN CONTROL

2032
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
ADVOCATES.

2033
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
HE ALLOWED GUNS ON AMTRAK TRAINS
AND ALLOWED GUNS IN NATIONAL

2034

2035
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
HE GAVE LIP SERVICE TO GETTING

2037
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000

2038

NOT.

2364
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
EMOTIONS STILL SO VERY RAW.

2365
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,000

2378
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
SAD THAT COWARDS OUT THERE WOULD

2379
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH A TRAGIC

2380
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:48,000

SO UNBELIEVABLY SAD MOMENT,

SOMEONE WAS SICK ENOUGH TO CALL

2391
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000

FOR MORE THAN A COUPLE SECONDS.

2443
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,000
HE WOULD ALWAYS LOOK DOWN AT HIS

2444
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,000

THE INABILITY TO FEEL PAIN.

2457

2458
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
HIMSELF, HE WOULD NOT KNOW IT OR

2459
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
FEEL IT.

2460
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000

2479
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
FOUND IN THE LANZA HOME.

2480
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
WHEN THEY FOUND IT, SOMEONE HAD
