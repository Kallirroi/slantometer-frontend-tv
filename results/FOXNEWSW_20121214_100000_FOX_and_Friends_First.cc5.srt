DEEPLY REGRET THE UNFAIR ATTACKS

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
ON SUSAN RICE IN RECENT WEEKS

125
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
THE POSITION DEMONSTRATES

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
STRENGTH OF HER CHARACTER AND

127
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
ADMIRABLE COMMITMENT TO RISE

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN BE PROUD

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
TO HAVE A PUBLIC SERVANT OF HER

DECISION TO WITHDRAW HER NAME.

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
GRAHAM HAS BEEN HIGHLY CRITICAL

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
OF RICE AND HER ROLE IN THE

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
ADMINISTRATION'S PUBLIC RESPONSE

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000

POLITICAL CONCLUSION IT WAS TOO

148
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
COSTLY FOR THE NOMINATION TO GO

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
FORWARD AND SHE WANTED TO GET

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT IT.

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS

155
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
TO GET THIS OFF THE RADAR

156
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000

RICE TO DISPIER.

163
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000

HEATHER?
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

171
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
NO SENATE CONFIRMATION.

172
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
THAT MIGHT BE KEY.

173
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
NOW IT IS TIME FOR A LOOK AT WHO

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000

WITH HER NOT BEING NOMINATED

182
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
BENGHAZI SCANDAL WILL DIE IN THE

MAINSTREAM MEDIA THEY WILL HAVE

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
NO INTEREST IN THE STORY.

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
THAT'S WHY I THINK THE PRESIDENT

186
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
PUT HIMSELF OUT THERE HE WOULD

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
RATHER HAVE HAD HER I THINK HE

IN HER HOME TOWN LATER TODAY.

380
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000

SHE TOOK THE LAST MINUTE

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
DECISION TO TAKE THE PLANE RIDE

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
EVEN THOUGH THEY OFFER TO DO PUT

TO COSTA RICA.

395
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
HE WAS ARRESTED FOR CARRYING

396
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
THIS ANTIQUE SHOT GUN.

397
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
IT BELONGED TO HIS GRANDFATHER.

398
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
A U.S. BORDER PATROL AGENT TOLD

399
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
HIM IT WAS LEGAL AS LONG AS HE

400
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
DECLARED IT WITH MEXICAN

401
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
AUTHORITIES.
WHEN HE WENT TO DO THAT HE WAS

402
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
ARRESTED INSTEAD.

403
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
>>> IN A MOMENT WE WILL HEAR HIS

404
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
PARENT'S PLEA TO PRESIDENT

405
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
OBAMA.
FIRST HERE'S HIS LAWYER'S

406
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
EXPLANATION OF THIS EVENT.

407
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
>> THE CUSTOMS TOLD HIM IT WAS

408
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
LEGAL TO GO TO MEXICO WITH

409
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
REGISTRATION PAPERS.

410
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
THE PROBLEM WAS WHEN HE CAME

411
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
BACK INTO THE STATES.

412
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
HE GOES THROUGH MEXICO WITH

413
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
CUSTOMS TOLD HIM TO WAIT AND

414
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
FOOI HOURS AFTER THEY RAISED HIM

415
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
FOR VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 11

416
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
PARAGRAPH H OF THE FEDERAL LAW

417
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
OF WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES WHICH

418
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
SAYS YOU CAN HAVE ANY SHOT GUN

419
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
EXCEPT CERTAIN TYPE OF SHOT GUNS

420
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
FOR EXAMPLE ONES OF CERTAIN

421
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
CALIBER.
THIS PARTICULAR CALIBER WAS .410

422
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
WHICH IS NOT -- IT IS NOT

423
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
RESERVED FOR EXCLUSIVE USE OF

424
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
THE ARMED FORCES AND NEITHER

425
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
WERE THE BULLETS THE GAUGES THAT

426
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
WAS FOR THE NONEXCLUSIVES.

427
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
THE ISSUE HERE REALLY IS THE

428
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
LENGTH OF THE BARREL.

429
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

430
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
HOW IT WAS MEASURED AND ALSO

431
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
MOST IMPORTANT THAT IS WHY.

432
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
THIS HAD TO BE UNDER 25 INCHES

433
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
AND WE BELIEVE THE PRESSURE WAS

434
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
TAKEN THE WRONG WAY.

435
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
>> THERE HAN SOME CRITICISM HERE

436
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
AT HOME THAT THE STATE

437
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
DEPARTMENT AND THE

438
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
ADMINISTRATION ARE NOT DOING

439
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
ENOUGH TO HELP SECURE HAMMER'S

440
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
RELEASE.
LAST NIGHT HIS PARENTS SPOKE

441
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
WITH SEAN HANNITY ABOUT THIS

442
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
MAKING A PLEA TO PRESIDENT

443
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
OBAMA.
>> WE ARE JUST ASKING FOR

444
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
EVERYONE TO TALK TO THEIR

445
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
LAWMAKERS.
I WOULD MAKE A PERSONAL PLEA TO

446
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
THE PRESIDENT TO CONTACT THE NEW

447
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
INCOMING PRESIDENT OF MEXICO AND

448
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
JUST ASK HIM TO RESOL 6 --

449
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
RESOLVE THIS CASE AND SEND HIM

450
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
HOME.
IT HAS GONE ON TOO LONG IT'S A

451
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
RIDICULOUS CASE.
I THINK THEY KNOW IT'S A

452
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
RIDICULOUS CASE BECAUSE IT WAS

453
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
AN ACCIDENT.
IT'S A CASE THAT THEIR OWN

454
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
MILITARY SENT LES TO THE JUDGES

455
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
AND PROSECUTORS SAYING THIS GUN

456
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
IS NOT ON THE RESTRICTED LIST

457
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
THAT IT IS TRYING TO RESTRICT

458
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
ASSAULT RIFLES ESSENTIALLY.

459
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
THIS ISN'T ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

460
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
THE PROSECUTORS AND THE JUDGES

461
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
HAVE REFUSED TO CONSIDER THAT.

462
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I AM JUST ASKING THE PRESIDENT

463
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
TO GET INVOLVED AT THIS POINT.

464
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
>> HAMMER'S NEXT HEAR SOMETHING

465
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY 17TH.

466
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
MORE ON THAT ON FOX AND FRIENDS

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
LATER THIS MORNING.

468
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
>>> THE TIME IS NOW 20 MINUTES

469
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
AFTER THE HOUR.

470
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
TROOPS PUTTING OUR LIVES ON THE

471
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
LINE TO PROTECT US FROM THE

472
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
TALIBAN.
WHY IS THE ARMY TELLING SOLDIERS

473
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
TO BE SO NICE TO THEM?

474
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
>> GET UP STAND UP.

475
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
A STUDY SAYS STANDING AND

476
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
SITTING COULD TELL YOU HOW LONG

477
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
YOU WILL LIVE.

478
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
This Bible changed the world.

479
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm Kirk Cameron. Four Hundred

480
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
years ago

481
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
our forefathers risked their

482
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
lives to bring this Bible to the

483
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
shores of America.

484
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Because it contained

485
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
the principals for economic

486
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
liberty,

487
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
political liberty and religious

488
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
freedom. The 1599 Geneva Bible.

489
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It was the first

490
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000

491
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
translation, complete with

492
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000

493
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
numbered verses and 300,000

494
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
utterly unique study notes.

495
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It actually came out

496
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
before the King James

497
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Version and because the

498
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
government didn't authorize it,

499
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
it was outlawed. But it was a

500
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Bible by the people,

501
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
for the people, the book

502
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
that built America.

503
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000

BAD FOR YOU, RIGHT?

THE RISK OF SUDDEN DEATH FOR

You know how painful heartburn
can be.

594

For fast, long lasting relief,
use doctor recommended
Gaviscon®.

595
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Only Gaviscon® forms a
protective barrier that helps

596
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
block stomach acid from
splashing up-

597

649
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000

THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS

659

PROPOSING IN VIRGINIA.
A FEDERAL JUDGE WILL HEAR

WATER AS A POLLUTANT AND DOING

665
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
SO WOULD REGULATE A SINGLE CREEK

666
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
THAT COULD COST THE STATE A

667
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
BILLION DOLLARS AND FORCE PEOPLE

668
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
OUT OF THEIR HOMES.

MUCH WATER IT CAN BE CLASSIFIED

677
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
AS POLLUTANT THAT GIVES THEM

678
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
REGULATORY POWER UNDER THE CLEAN

679
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000

COMPLAINED THAT LAST YEAR'S

687
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000

688
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
A SPEECH ON ANTI BULLYING WILL

689
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000

AGREEMENT YET.

723
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
BUT WE MAY SEE MORE OF A

BAND-AID APPROACH AS OPPOSED TO

725
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
A BIG FIX, ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD

726
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
REQUIRE THE REPUBLICANS GIVE IN

727
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
TO THE PRESIDENT TO RAISE TAXES.

NO AGREEMENT CAME OUT OF THAT
