SHE HAD STAYED IN THE CONFERENCE

HER IS THAT THE PRINCIPAL AND

122
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
OTHER PEOPLE GOT SHOT WHEN THEY

123
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
WENT OUT INTO THE HALLWAY.

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
>> I WORKED SO CLOSE, I SAW THE

125
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
FIRST COPS ROLLING DOWN THERE.

126
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
SO, I JUST LITERALLY RAN DOWN

127
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
THERE AND I GOT PRETTY MUCH UP

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
TO THE SCHOOL WITH A BUNCH OF

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
OTHER PARENTS RIGHT ON THE SCENE

130
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
AND AS THEY WERE LEADING THE

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
KIDS OUT SINGLE FILE, I SAW HIM

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
RIGHT AWAY AND JUST WENT WITH

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000

134
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
WHAT DID HE WANT TO TALK TO YOU

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
ABOUT?
>> HE DOES NOT REALLY WARRANTY

137
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
HE'S JUST SCARED AND SHAKEN.

139
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
HE TOLD US THAT HE DIDN'T SEE

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
BUT HEARD.
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE JUST FOCUSED ON

141
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
COMFORTING HIM.
>> I HEARD THAT CHILDREN WERE

142
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
TAKEN OUT BLOODY, SEVERAL

143
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
TEACHERS AND A MOTHER WHO WAS

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
ACTUALLY IN THE SCHOOL SAID THAT

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
A MASKED MAN CAME IN AND STARTED

146
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
FIRING.

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
WE ARRIVED, I WOULD SAY PROBABLY

150
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
THERE WERE 30, 40 PARENTS THERE

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
OR SO, THEY WERE JUST GATHERING

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
CHILDREN AT THE FIRE HOUSE.

153
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
IT BEGAN A CHAOTIC SITUATION.

154
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
LIKE I SAID, BETWEEN THE POLICE

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000

157
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL TEACHERS,

158
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I MEAN, I'M JUST SO PROUD OF THE

159
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
WAY OUR TOWN HAS RESPONDED TO

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THIS.
>> THAT SUMS IT UP FOR THE

161
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
PARENTS AND THE PEOPLE ABLE TO

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'M JUST PROUD OF THE WAY THIS

165
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
>> THAT WAS THE SUSPICIOUS SINCE

190
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
THE FIRST THING THIS MORNING.

191
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
WE HAVE COVERED SO MANY OF THESE

192
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
AND YOU JUST A HATE TO HAVE

193
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
CONFIRM IT, THE GUNMAN, THE

194
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
GUNMAN HAS SOME SORT OF

195
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE INSIDE

196
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THE SCHOOL AND THERE YOU HEARD,

197
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
PIERRE, REPORTING THAT IT'S RYAN

198
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
LANZA, HE'S FROM NEW JERSEY, 24

199
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
YEARS OLD.

200
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
IT'S BELIEVED HIS MOTHER WAS A

201
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
TEACHER IN THE SCHOOL.

202
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
IT'S BELIEVED THAT SHE DIDN'T

203
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
SURVIVE ALONG WITH 26 OTHERS.

204
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
THE TOTAL IS AT LEAST 27 DEAD

205
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
AND COUNTING.

206
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
MANY OF THEM CHILDREN.

207
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
AND AS WE IN THE COMING HOURS

208
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
LEARN ABOUT THE FAMILIES WHO

209
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
WILL HAVE JUST THE HORRIFIC

210
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
JOURNEY AHEAD OF LEARNING

211
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
PERHAPS THEIR CHILD DID NOT

212
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
SURVIVE.
WE KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR IS ON

213
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
THE SCENE, HE'S MEETING WITH

214
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
PARENTS.

215
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
A NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND STAFF

216
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
MEMBERS DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT OF

217
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
THE SCHOOL.

218
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
BRAD GARRETT JOINS US, FORGIVE

219
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
ME, BRAD, TYPICALLY, WE'RE

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
TRYING TO GET INTO THE MIND OF

221
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
SOMEONE CAPABLE OF SOMETHING

222
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
LIKE THIS, THIS IS THE KIND OF

223
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
PIECING TOGETHER THAT PROFILERS

224
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
LIKE YOU DO IN A CASE LIKE THIS,

225
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
4 YEARS OLD AND HIS MOTHER WAS A

226
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL.

227
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
>> AND SO, WHAT YOU TAKE AWAY

228
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
FROM THAT, THERE IS SOMETHING

229
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
GOING ON AND PROBABLY LONG TERM

230
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM AND HE

231
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
WANTED BEYOND KILLING HER,

232
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
OBVIOUSLY, SOMEONE THAT WOULD

233
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
COMMIT THIS TYPE OF ACT COULD

234
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
HAVE KILLED HIS MOTHER AT ANY

235
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
POINT, HE WANTED TO INFLICT

236
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
INJURIES AMONG OTHERS BEYOND HIS

237
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
MOTHER, PERHAPS WHAT SHE STOOD

238
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
FOR IN REFERENCE TO THE SCHOOL,

239
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
KEEP IN MIND, PEOPLE WHO DO

240
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
THESE THINGS IS DRIVEN BY

241
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
DELUSION, THE DELUSION IS, THIS

242
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
HAS HARMED ME, THIS WOMAN HAS

243
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
HARMED ME, SHE TEACHES THESE
CHILDREN, I'M GOING TO GET RID

244
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
OF HER AND THE WORLD AROUND HER.

245
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
IT COULD BE THAT.

246
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
SOMETHING IN HIS OWN CHILDHOOD

247
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
IN RELATION TO HER.

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
IT'S MY BELIEF WITHOUT KNOWING

249
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
ANYTHING ELSE, THIS GOES BEYOND

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
JUST HER BUT WHAT SHE REPRESENTS

251
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
IN ADDITION TO OBVIOUSLY KILLING

252
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
HER.
>> BRAD, STICK WITH US.

253
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I WANT TO GO BACK TO PIERRE,

254
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS

255
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
24-YEAR-OLD AND HIS HOME,

256
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
PERHAPS SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS

257
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE INFLICTED

258
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
PAIN HERE OTHER THAN THIS

259
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
SCHOOL?
>> WELL, AGAIN, THIS IS A VERY

260
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
FLUID SITUATION.

261
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A SEARCH

262
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
ONGOING AT A RESIDENCE IN NEW

263
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
JERSEY, THOUGHT TO BE THE

264
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
RESIDENCE OF HIS PARENTS.

265
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
WE'RE TRYING TO GET SOME

266
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
ADDITIONAL REPORTING ABOUT WHAT

267
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
IS HAPPENING AT THE HOME.

268
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
WE'RE NOT QUITE READY TO RELEASE

269
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
THAT INFORMATION YET.

270
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
UNTIL WE KNOW IT'S ACCURATE.

271
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
AGAIN, WHAT MY SOURCES ARE

272
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
TELLING ME IS THAT THIS

273
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
24-YEAR-OLD RYAN LANZA HAD GONE

274
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
ON A SHOOTING SPREE AT MULTIPLE

275
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
LOCATIONS AND THAT WE MIGHT

276
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
ADDITIONAL DEAD BODIES.

277
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
>> CHILLING TO HEAR THAT

278
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
DEVELOPMENT.
WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS

279
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
SHORTLY AFTER 9:30 THIS MORNING.

280
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
AS YOU HEARD PIERRE THOMAS, OUR

281
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT REPORT

282
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
THERE MOMENTS AGO, AUTHORITIES

283
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
ARE NOW INVESTIGATING A

284
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
4-YEAR-OLD WHOSE NAME IS RYAN

285
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
LANZA BELIEVED TO BE FROM NEW

286
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
JERSEY.

287
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE NOW AT THE

288
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
HOME INVESTIGATING WHETHER OR

289
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
NOT HE MIGHT HAVE INFLICTED PAIN

290
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
ON OTHER PEOPLE.

291
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
PIERRE REPORTING THAT IT'S

292
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
POSSIBLE THAT THE SCHOOL WASN'T

293
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
HIS ONLY TARGET.

294
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
WE'LL CHECK BACK IN WITH HIM AS

295
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
SOON AS WE GET INFORMATION ON

296
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
OTHER POSSIBLE VICTIMS.

297
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
WHAT WE DO KNOW THIS AFTERNOON,

298
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
THIS WAS A 24-YEAR-OLD, HIS NAME

299
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
ON THE SCREEN THERE, RYAN LANZA

300
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
OF NEW JERSEY.
HIS MOTHER WAS A TEACHER AT THE

301
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
SCHOOL.

302
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
SHE WAS ONE OF AT LEAST 27

303
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
PEOPLE KILLED INSIDE THAT

304
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
SCHOOL, IT'S BELIEVED.

305
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE TAUGHT AT

306
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
THE SCHOOL.

307
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'M GUESSING WE'LL LEARN THAT

308
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
QUITE SHORTLY.

309
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
THEIR PARTS OF THESE

310
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
COMMUNITIES, THE TEACHERS WHO

311
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
PROUDLY WHATEVER THEIR SUBJECT

312
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
IS, WHATEVER THE GRADE LEVEL IS

313
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
IT THEY HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO

314
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
FOR THE YEAR.

315
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
AS YOU LOOK AT THE CALENDAR,

316
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH DECEMBER.

317
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
THIS IS TYPICALLY A JOYOUS TIME

318
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
IN SCHOOLS, THEY GET THAT BREAK

319
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
THEY SO LOOK FORWARD TO, THAT

320
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
EXTENDED BREAK THAT TAKE THEM

321
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S

322
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
HOLIDAYS.

323
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'M SURE THAT THE DECORATIONS

324
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
THEY HAD, UP AND DOWN THOSE

325
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
HALLWAYS, BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW

326
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
THAT IT WAS ALL TURNED UPSIDE

327
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
DOWN INSIDE THIS SCHOOL, SANDY

328
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

329
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.
AND JUST LOOK AT THESE IMAGES,

330
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
THESE CHILDREN WITH THEIR ARMS

331
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
WRAPPED AROUND THEIR PARENTS.

332
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
THIS LITTLE BOY WITH HIS HANDS

333
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
UP TO HIS FACE.

334
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
AND THE TEARS.

335
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
SO OFTEN WE HAVE HEARD

336
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY HERE THAT THE

337
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
CHILDREN WERE THE ONES WHO WERE

338
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
CALMEST, WHO WERE THE MOST

339
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
QUIET, THERE WERE TEARS, THERE

340
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
WERE CRIES BUT THE MOST -- THE

341
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
OLDER PEOPLE, THE PARENTS, THE

342
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
OLDER STUDENTS WERE SO WORRIED

343
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEIR

344
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
YOUNGER SIBLINGS WOULD MAKE IT

345
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
OUT.
WE HEARD FROM A 17-YEAR-OLD WHO

346
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
WAS JUST INCREDIBLY RELIEVED HIS

347
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
FOURTH GRADE SISTER HAD MADE IT

348
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
OUT.

349
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
NOW WILL COME THE DIFFICULT TASK

350
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
FOR THE FAMILIES WHO PICKED UP

351
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
THOSE KIDS TO EXPLAIN THEM,

352
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
THOSE OF US IN THIS INDUSTRY,

353
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
HAVE TO ANSWER THE SAME

354
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
QUESTIONS EVERY TIME, WHICH IS,

355
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
HOW CAN SOMEONE DO THIS?

356
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
WERE THERE RED FLAGS?

357
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
COULD ANYTHING BE DONE TO

358
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
PREVENT THIS TRAGEDY?

359
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
HISTORIC IN NATURE.

360
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
AS WE KNOW VIRGINIA TECH, AT

361
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
THIS POINT, AS WE LOOK BACK, IT

362
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
APPEARS THAT VIRGINIA TECH WAS

363
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
THE ONLY SHOOTING THE DEADLIER

364
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
THAN THE ONE WE'RE REPORTING ON

365
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
THIS ONE THIS MORNING.

366
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
SOMETHING THAT WE'LL NEVER

367
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
FORGET AT VIRGINIA TECH BUT AT

368
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
SCHOOLS, ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS,

369
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
MIDDLE SCHOOLS ACROSS AMERICA,

370
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE

371
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
THIS.
THE NUMBERS ARE SIMPLY STOPPING

372
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
EVERYONE WHO IS TURNING ON THEIR

373

FOR WORD.

382
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
WE WERE TALKING WITH N.J.

383
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
BURKETT EARLIER, HE'S MOVED ON

384
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
IN REPORTING.

385
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
IT'S ABOUT AN HOUR FROM NEW

386
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
YORK, NORTHEAST OF NEW YORK

387
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
CITY.
HE WAS REPORTING FROM THE

388
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
HOSPITAL, WHICH IS DANBURY

389
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
HOSPITAL, THAT WAS THE DEDICATED

390
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
HOSPITAL FOR THIS INCIDENT.

391
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
THE MOMENT THE CALL CAME IN.

392
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
YOU CAN SEE THE GEOGRAPHY WE'RE

393
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
TALKING ABOUT.

394
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
NEWTOWN NOT FAR AWAY FROM NEW

395
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
YORK.
IN DANBURY THAT'S WHERE THE

396
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
HOSPITAL IS, THEY HAD PREPARED

397
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
FOR THIS.

398
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
N.J. REPORTING THAT THE NURSES,

399
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
THE TEAMS INSIDE THAT HOSPITAL

400
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
SHAKEN BUT I'M SURE DETERMINED

401
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
TO HELP THE PEOPLE WHO CAME

402
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
THROUGH THAT DOOR.

403
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
WHAT WAS STUNNING TO HEAR IN

404
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
THIS CASE, ONLY THREE PEOPLE

405
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
THAT WE KNOW OF SO FAR, BEING

406
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
TREATED AT THE HOSPITAL.

407
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
SO MANY OF THE AMBULANCES, THOSE

408
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
AMBULANCES PULLING UP AND

409
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
SITTING THERE.

410
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
NO LIGHTS, NO SIRENS AND VERY

411
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
FEW OF THEM, IF ANY, LEFT THE

412
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
SCENE WITH ANYONE TO BE SAVED.

413
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
THAT IS SIMPLY STAGGERING.

414
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS

415
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
ABOUT THIS THAT MAKES IT SO

416
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
HEINOUS AND SO HARD TO

417
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
COMPREHEND, THE PEOPLE WHO

418
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
DIDN'T MAKE OUT OF THIS SCHOOL

419
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A CHANCE.

420
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
AT LEAST 27.

421
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THEM ARE

422
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
CHILDREN.
AND BRAD GARRETT OUR FBI

423
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
PROFILER WHO WE TURN TO IN THESE

424
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
CASES TALKING ABOUT HOW PEOPLE

425
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
WHO COMMIT THESE KIND OF CRIMES

426
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY WALK IN

427
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
AND INTO A SCHOOL LIKE THIS, AND

428
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
IT'S SO IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND

429
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
HOW THEY CAN TARGET YOUNG

430
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
CHILDREN IN THEIR CLASSROOMS

431
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
DOING WHAT IT IS THEY'RE TOLD

432
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
TO, HOW THEY COULD DO THIS,

433
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
COMMIT THIS WITH CHILDREN WHO

434
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
ARE SO INNOCENT AND AS I

435
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO, JUST

436
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
SHOWING UP TO SCHOOL, KNOWING A

437
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
COUPLE OF WEEKS, IF I REMEMBER

438
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
CORRECTLY, EVERY ONE OF THOSE

439
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
CHILDREN HAD THAT COUNTDOWN IN

440
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
THEIR HEAD, HOW MANY DAYS LEFT

441
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
NOT ONLY TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS

442
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
BUT TO TAKE THE HOLIDAY BREAK?

443
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
TO CELEBRATE NEW YEAR'S.

444
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

445
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
BROUGHT UNDER THE TREE, WE DO

446
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

447
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
BRIEFED ON THIS REPEATEDLY

448
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

449
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
JAKE TAPPER IN THE BRIEFING

450
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
ROOM.
WE'LL CHECK IN WHEN WE CAN.

451
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
WE KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT

452
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
REACHED OUT TO CONNECTICUT

453
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
GOVERNOR DAN MALLOY.

454
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
HE HAS THE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE

455
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
TASK OF MEETING WITH PARENTS WHO

456
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEIR DHICHILN

457
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
ARE AND WE DON'T KNOW IF THE

458
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
PARENTS OF THE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN

459
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
TOLD.

460
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE

461
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
TEACHERS WHO WERE SHOWING UP TO

462
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
DO THEIR WORK TODAY AND WON'T BE

463
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
COMING HOME AFTER THIS UNFOLDED

464
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
TODAY.
WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT

465
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
WILL BE SPEAKING IN A

466
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
HALF-HOUR'S TIME.

467
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
WE'LL BE STAYING WITH YOU AND

468
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
YOU'LL BE ASSURED THAT WE'LL

469
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
BRING YOU THE PRESIDENT AS SOON

470
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
AS HE APPEARS BEFORE THE CAMERA.

471
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
THE PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW THIS

472
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
PRESIDENCY, HE OFTEN TALKED

473
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
ABOUT HIS TWO DAUGHTERS AND WHAT

474
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
THEY SEE AT SCHOOL WITH THEIR

475
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
FRIENDS, AND NO QUESTION THAT

476
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
HE'LL APPEAR BEFORE THAT CAMERA

477
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
TODAY NOT ONLY AS OUR PRESIDENT

478
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
BUT AS A FATHER AS WELL, THE

479
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN SAYING

480
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS AFFECTED

481
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
AS IN PARENT WOULD BE THINKING

482
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
ABOUT HIS OWN CHILDREN.

483
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
>>> I WANT TO BE IN DR. JEN

484
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
ASHTON, AS WE AWAIT THE

485
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
PRESIDENT, WE EXPECT TO HEAR

486
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
FROM HIM WITHIN A HALF-HOUR.

487
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
HE'S A FATHER, TOO, THERE'S THIS

488
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
DELICATE TASK IN THE NEXT HOURS,

489
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
DAYS, TO NOT ONLY OVERTALK THIS

490
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
BUT TO TALK IT THROUGH WITH YOUR

491
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
CHILDREN AND WHAT A TASK IT IS.

492
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
>> IT IS AN UNFATHOMABLE TASK,

493
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
DAVID.
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO BE A

494
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
PARENT TO IMAGINE THAT THIS WILL

495
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
IMPACT EVERY PERSON WHO HEARSE

496
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
THIS STORY, BECAUSE IT'S REALLY

497
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
NOT ABOUT BEING A PARENT, IT'S

498
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
NOT ABOUT A BEING TEACHER, IT'S

499
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
ABOUT A BEING HUMAN BEING.

500
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH ASPECT IS

501
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
ENORMOUS.
THE ISSUE OF SHOCK AND TRAUMA TO

502
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
THE CHILDREN WERE IMMEDIATELY AT

503
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
THE SCENE.

504
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
THERE'S THE ISSUE OF SHOCK AND

505
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
DRAW MA TO THE TEACHERS, TO THE

506
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
FACULTIES, TO THE FIRST

507
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
RESPONDERS.

508
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
THAT SHOCK WAVE WILL CONTINUE

509
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
OUT TO EVERY ONE IN THE COUNTRY

510
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
IF NOT THE WORLD WHO HEARSE THIS

511
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
STORY.

512
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
YOU HAVE TO BE CONCERNED WITH

513
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
REACTIVE DEPREX, PTSD, THAT

514
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
THOSE ARE FIRST AND FOREMOST,

515
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE SHOOTER,

516
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
THIS IS THE FACE OF MENTAL

517
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
ILLNESS.
BY DEFINITION, THIS IS REALLY

518
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
WHAT YOU CANNOT COMMIT A CRIME

519
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
LIKE THIS WITHOUT AN ELEMENT OF

520
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
ACUTE PSYCHOSIS.

521
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME PUTTING

522
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
ALL THESE THOUGHTS INTO WORDS AS

523
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE ARE.

524
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
IT'S JUST UNTHINKABLE.

525
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
>> YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS SO

526
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
WELCOME.
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MENTAL

527
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
ILLNESS, I HAVE TO ASK THE

528
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
QUESTION, IF THAT'S THE CASE

529
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
THERE HAD BEEN WARNING SIGNS,

530
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
FLAGS ALONG THE WAY, WHAT DO WE

531
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
DO AS A COUNTRY TO TRY TO REACH

532
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
OUT AND PROVENT THESE THINGS?

533
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
MENTAL ILLNESS PREVENTS ITSELF

534
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
LONG BEFORE WE GET TO SOMETHING

535
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
LIKE THIS.

536
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
>> RIGHT.

537
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY, ALL TOO

538
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
OFTEN IN THE RECENT PAST, TO

539
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
BRING THAT TO THE FOREFRONT OF

540
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
PEOPLE'S MINDS, THE DEFINITION

541
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
OF ACUTE PSYCHOSIS IS IMPAIRED

542
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
REALITY TESTING, NO ONE CAN

543
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
COMMIT A CRIME LIKE THIS WHILE

544
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
HAVING A NORMAL SENSE OF REALITY

545
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
AND IMPACT JUDGMENT.

546
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ACUTE BEING

547
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
MENTAL ILLNESS ISSUE TO THE

548
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
FOREFRONT IT'S --

549
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000

"WORLD NEWS."

554
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
DIANE SAWYER WILL BE REPORTING.

555
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
SHE'S TALKED TO MANY OF THE

556
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
PARENTS THERE ALREADY.

557
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000

ABCNEWS.COM THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

561
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000

DR. RICHARD BESSER, YOUR

565
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
PARENT AS WELL.

566
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
YOU'LL WANT TO GET YOUR CHILDREN

567
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
AWAY FROM THE SELL VISION SET.

568
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
WHAT DO YOU TELL YOUR CHILDREN,

569
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIVE IN THAT

570
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
COMMUNITY, AS WE KNOW IN THE AGE

571
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
OF INTERNET, TWITTER AND EL

572
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
EVERYTHING ELSE, IT WILL BE

573
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
ALMOST INESCAPABLE.

574
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, DAVID, YOU

575
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
CAN'T SHIELD OLDER CHILDREN

576
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000

I RECEIVED A TEXT FROM MY HIGH

577
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
SCHOOL SON THIS AFTERNOON,

578
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
SAYING DAD, WHAT'S THE STORY IN

579
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
CONNECTICUT?
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.

580
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
SO, YOU NEED TO ENGAGE YOUR

581
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
CHILDREN, YOU NEED TO KNOW YOUR

582
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
CHILD AND KNOW HOW THEY RESPOND

583
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
TO STRESS.

584
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
AS JEN ASHTON WAS SAYING, WE

585
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
HAVE SEEN FAR TOO MANY OF THESE

586
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
EVENTS YOU MAY HAVE SOME

587
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW YOUR CHILD
IS GOING TO RESPOND TO SOMETHING

588
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
THAT'S SO DIFFICULT TO

589
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
UNDERSTAND.

590
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
AND HOW YOU ADDRESS YOUR CHILD,

591
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
HOW YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF WILL

592
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
REALLY, AGAIN -- YOU WANT TO

593
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
PROTECT YOUR OWN FEARS ON THE

594
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
SITUATION.

595
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
THOSE CELL PHONES AS WE'RE

601
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000

IT'S NOW CLOSING IN ON 3:00 THIS

608
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
AFTERNOON.

609
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE WHITE

610
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
HOUSE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL

611
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
MAKE A STATEMENT TODAY.

612
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
HE WAS INFORMED THIS MORNING.

613
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
HE'S BEEN BRIEFED SEVERAL TIMES

614
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
THROUGHOUT THE MORNING.

615
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
HE'LL ADDRESS THE NATION ON

616
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
PERHAPS THE WORST SCHOOL

617
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
SHOOTING IN AMERICAN HISTORY FOR

618
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THAT IS OUR

619
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
BELIEF THIS AFTERNOON AND AS WE

620
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
KNOW HE'S JUST BEGUN WHAT WILL

621
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
BE A SECOND TERM, HE'S NOT BEEN

622
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
INAUGURATED BUT THE ELECTION

623
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
BEHIND HIM AND THESE ARE THE

624
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
THINGS THAT PRESIDENT HAS TO GET

625
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA AND

626
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
REASSURE THE NATION THAT WE'LL

627
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE

628
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
SURE WE MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL

629
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

630
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
YOU CAN SEE THE WOMAN RIGHT

631
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
THERE, THE ANGUISH TO HER FACE,

632
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
HOLDING A CELL PHONE TO HER EAR,

633
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
THAT LITTLE GIRL IN HER PIG

634
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
TAILS.

635
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T

636
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
EXPECT ON A FRIDAY MORNING,

637
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
CLOSING IN ON THE CHRISTMAS, THE

638
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
HOLIDAY SEASON IN SCHOOLS ACROSS

639
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
AMERICA, WHEN SCHOOL CHILDREN

640
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
THINK THEY'RE ALMOST THERE,

641
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
THEY'RE ALMOST TO THAT PRIZED

642
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
VACATION THAT THEY HAVE EARNED

643
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
AND THAT VISIT PERHAPS FROM

644
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
SANTA OR IF THEY'RE CELEBRATING

645
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
OTHER HOLIDAYS THIS TIME OF

646
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
YEAR, THIS ISN'T ANYTHING THAT

647
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
WE WANT TO WISH ON ANY SCHOOL OR

648
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
ANY LITTLE PERSON IN THIS

649
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
COUNTRY.
IS WHAT THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH

650
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
TODAY.

651
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000

THE GUNMAN HAS BEEN EYE DPENT

654
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
MIED AS 24-YEAR-OLD RYAN LANZA.

655
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
IT'S BELIEVED THAT HIS MOTHER

656
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
WAS A TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL.

657
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
WE LEARNED NOT ONLY, A MOTHER

658
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
AND A SON.

659
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
WE BELIEVE THAT THE MOTHER DID

660
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
NOT MAKE IT OUT.

661
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
THAT SHE WAS A TEACHER THERE.

662
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE TAUGHT AT

663
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
THE SCHOOL.

664
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'M SURE WE'LL LEARN THAT AS THE

665
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
HOURS UNFOLD HERE.

ANYTHING BEYOND THAT.

677
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
IT'S BELIEVED THAT AUTHORITIES

678
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
ARE NOT CONVINCED THAT THIS

679
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000

HEROISM THAT WE ALWAYS REPORT,

ANYONE OUT THERE?

695
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT OTHERS.

696
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'M READING THIS QUOTE RIGHT NOW

697
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
THE TEACHER SAID, SHE REPLIED TO

BE POSITIVE.

706
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
THAT'S THE EXTRAORDINARY TALE OF

707
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
JUST ONE TEACHER.

708
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
WE APPLAUD ALL OF THEM WHO

709
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000

CONNECTICUT.

724
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
HE HAD THE IMPAOSSIBLE TASK OF

725
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
SHOWING UP AT THAT SCHOOL AND

726
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000

SCHOOL WAS SECURED.

748
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000

BATHROOM.

IT COMPLETELY CLEAR WHICH SCHOOL
