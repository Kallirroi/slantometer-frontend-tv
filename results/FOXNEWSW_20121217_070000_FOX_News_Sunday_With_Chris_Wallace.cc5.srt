TOWN WHERE NEIGHBORS KNOW

194
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000

MINUTE.

241
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
IT'S WHAT BOTH OUR SON AND OUR

243
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
INCOMPREHENSIBLE.

244
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF

245
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
A SENSELESS ACT.

246
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
WE TRY TO EXPLAIN THINGS THAT

250
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
CAN'T BE EXPLAINED.

251
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
AND WE TAKE STOCK IN OUR FAITH

252
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
AND IN OUR COMMUNITY, OUR

253
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
NEIGHBORS AND OUR FRIENDS WHO

254
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000

DOES ALEXIS WANT TO TALK ABOUT

259
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000

260
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000

263
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PRY TOO

264
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000

265
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
TELLING US STUFF, WE'RE

WE'RE NOT PRYING INTO HER, YOU

269
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000

270
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

271
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
>> ROBERT, YOUR SON, ADEN, IS

272
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
IN THE FIRST GRADE.

273
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE

274
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
GUNMAN BURST INTO HIS

275
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
CLASSROOM AND WAS CON FRONTED

276
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
AND SHOT HIS VERY BRAVE

277
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
TEACHER.
WE WILL TALK ABOUT HER IN A

278
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
MINUTE.

279
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
VICTORIA SOTO.
WHAT DID ADEN DO AFTER THAT.

280
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
>> WE'RE FINDING OUT MORE AND

281
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000

282
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
BUT HE BASICALLY THE CHILDREN

WITNESSED THE SHOOTER COME

284
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000

FIRING.

287
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
THE CHILDREN ACTED ON INSTINCT

288
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
AND WHAT THEY WERE TAUGHT,

289
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
WHICH WAS TO RUN.

290
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
AND THEY DID.

291
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
THEY JUST RAN UP TO THE MAIN

292
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
ROAD 100 YARDS AWAY.

293
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
MY SON AND SEVERAL OF HIS

294
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
OTHER STUDENTS WERE EXTREMELY

295
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
BRAVE IN WHAT THEY DID AND

296
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
ACTED WITH COURAGE THAT I

297
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE.

298
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
AND AGAIN, THEY JUST RAN AND

299
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO MEET

300
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
A WOMAN WHO WAS -- IS ANOTHER

301
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000

303
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
>> Chris: I UNDERSTAND.
>> THEY JUST JUST RAN.

304
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT ADEN NOT

305
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
ONLY WAITED FOR ADEN TO MAKE

306
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
SURE HE WAS SAFE.

307
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
TELL US ABOUT VICTORIA SOTO.

FIRST GRADE TEACHER ACTUALLY

310
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
TRIED TO PERSUADE THE GUNMAN

311
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
NOT TO SHOOT AND PUT HERSELF

312
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
IN FRONT OF THE GUNMAN AND

313
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
LOST HER LIFE TRYING TO SAVE

314
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
HER CHILDREN.

315
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000

MY WIFE KNEW HER A LITTLE BIT

319
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
BETTER THAN I DID.

320

SHE LOVED THEM IN RETURN.

326
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
SHE WAS VERY SPECIAL AND WE'LL

PRINCIPAL DAWN HOCHSPRUNG.

332
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
WE UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN SHE

SHE WAS A WONDERFUL WONDERFUL

359
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
PERSON.
THERE IS NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
THE LOSS THAT WE ALL AS A

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
RIGHT?

376
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
SO, ALL OF THE CHILDREN KNOW

377
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
EACH OTHER FROM PRESCHOOL.

378
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
THEY GO TO CHURCH TOGETHER.

379
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
THEY HAVE PLAY DATES TOGETHER.

380
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
WENER THOUGHT HE WAS GONE BUT

381
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
HE COULD HAVE VERY WELL BEEN

382
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
ONE OF THOSE THAT WERE

383
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
AFFECTED.
WE FEEL VERY BLESSED.

384
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
AND IT IS BITTERSWEET BECAUSE

385
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
WE DO, WHILE WE FEEL BLESSED

386
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
THAT WE STILL HAVE OUR SON AND

387
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
OUR DAUGHTER, WE MOURN FOR OUR

388
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS WHO

389
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
WEREN'T AS FORTUNATE AND LOST

390
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
THEIR CHILDREN.

391
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
>> Chris: LYNN, FINALLY I

392
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
GUESS THIS IS THE HARDEST

393
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
QUESTION, HOW DO YOU MAKE

394
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
SENSE OF THIS?

395
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
THERE IS NO SENSE.

396
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE

397
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
TO THIS I THINK I'M STILL VERY

398
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
NUMB.

399
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
LIKE ROBERT SAID WE ARE

400
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
BLESSED HAVING OUR DAUGHTER

401
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000

402
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
HOW MANY FAMILIES AND FRIENDS

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
AND EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY

404
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
DIDN'T GO HOME WITH THEIR

405
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
CHILDREN FRIDAY NIGHT.

406
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
IT'S JUST VERY VERY HEART

407
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
WRENCHING AND THERE IS NO --

408
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
THERE IS NO WAY TO MAKE ANY

409
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
SENSE OF ANYTHING WHAT THIS

410
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
PERSON HAS DONE.

411
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
NOT ONLY TO FAMILIES BUT TO A

412
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
COMMUNITY, TO A NATION, AND

413
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
IT'S JUST UNFATHOMABLE.

414
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
YOU JUST DON'T.

415
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
WHO WOULD HAVE EVER THOUGHT

00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000

>> THANK YOU.

440
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
>> Chris: FRIDAY'S MASS
SHOOTING IS THE WORST IN

441
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
CONNECTICUT HISTORY SECOND

442
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
WORST EVER IN THIS COUNTRY.

443
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
COLD NUMBERS ONLY MAGNIFY THE

444
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
FACT THAT THE SO MANY OF THE

445
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
VICTIMS WERE SMALL CHILDREN.

446
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
JOINING US NOW IS JOE

447
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
LIEBERMAN WHO HAS REPRESENTED

448
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
CONNECTICUT FOR 24 YEARS.

449
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN ON

450
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
THIS DIFFICULT WEEKEND.

451
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
>> THANK YOU, CHRIS.

452
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
>> Chris: WHAT DO WE DO?

453
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
>> YOU KNOW AS LYNN SAID,

454
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
THERE IS NO ANSWER, I MEAN,

455
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
THIS IS EVIL.

456
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS MANY

457
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
TIMES.

458
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I THINK WE NEED A NATIONAL

459
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
COMMISSION ON MASS VIOLENCE.

460
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
NOT TO BE IN PLACE OF ANYTHING

461
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
ELSE THE PRESIDENT OR CONGRESS

462
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
OR STATE GOVERNMENTS MIGHT

463
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
WANT TO DO BUT TO MAKE SURE

464
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
THAT HEART BREAK AND THE ANGER

465
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
THAT WE FEEL NOW IS NOT

466
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
DISSIPATED OVER TIME OR LOST

467
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
IN LEGISLATIVE GRIDLOCK.

468
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU, THIS

469
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
REMINDS ME OF THE DAYS AND

470
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
WEEKS AFTER THE TERRORIST

471
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
ATTACKS AGAINST US OF 9/11.

472
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
AND AT ONE POINT, JOHN MCCAIN

473
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
AND I TURNED TO EACH OTHER AND

474
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
SAID WE CAN'T LET THIS JUST

475
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
GO.
WE HAVE GOT TO CREATE A

476
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
NATIONAL COMMISSION TO

477
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
INVESTIGATE EXACTLY THE

478
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
QUESTIONS WE ARE ASKING ABOUT

479
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
NEW TOWN.
HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED

480
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
AND IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN

481
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
DO TO TRY TO PREVENT IT FROM

482
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
HAPPENING AGAIN.
>> THERE WERE FORUMS AFTER

483
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
9/11 AND AFTER THE COMMISSION

484
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
AND THE WAY THAT THE

485
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND THE

486
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
FBI SHARED INFORMATION.

487
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
IT WASN'T JUST LET'S WALLOW IN

488
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
OUR GRIEF.

489
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
>> NO.

490
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
>> Chris: LET ME ASK YOU A

491
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
SPECIFIC QUESTION.
>> I WANT TO SAY VERY QUICKLY

492
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I

493
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN.

494
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I DON'T WANT US TO WALLOW IN

495
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
OUR GRIEF.

496
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I WANT US TO ASK WHAT CAN WE

497
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
DO AS A SOCIETY TO MAKE SURE

498
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
YOUNG MEMBER LIKE ADAM LANZA

499
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
GET HELP BEFORE THEY BECOME

500
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
SHOOTERS AND KILLERS.

501
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
WHAT'S THE ROLE OF VIOLENCE IN

502
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
OUR ENTERTAINMENT CULTURE

503
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
TODAY IT IN STIMULATING A

504
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
VULNERABLE KID LIKE THIS?

505
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
AND WHAT MORE CAN WE DO TO

506
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
KEEP DANGEROUS WEAPONS OUT OF

507
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
THE HANDS OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS?

508
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
>> Chris: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT

509
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
SOME OF THOSE SPECIFIC

510
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
QUESTIONS.
BACK IN THE 90'S YOU SUPPORTED

511
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
THE BREATED LAW WHICH CALLED

512
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
FOR A FIVE DAY WAITING PERIOD.

513
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
>> RIGHT.

514
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
>> Chris: YOU AASSAULT WEAPONS

515
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
BAN.
YOU AND AL GORE CAMPAIGNED

516
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
AROUND THE COUNTRY AND YOU

517
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
LOST AND A LOT OF PEOPLE TOOK

518
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
AS A LESSEN PART OF IT WAS IN

519
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
STATES LIKE TENNESSEE AND WEST

520
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
VIRGINIA THE FACT THAT YOU

521
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
WERE PROGUN CONTROL AND QUITE

522
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
FRANKLY EVER SINCE DEMOCRATS

523
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
HAVE BEEN SCARED OF TOUCHING

524
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
THAT ISSUE.

525
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
IS IT FULL-TIME FOR DEMOCRATS

526
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
TO PUSH FOR STRICTER GUN

527
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
CONTROL?

528
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
>> IT'S TIME FOR DEMOCRATS,

529
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS

530
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
TO SAY -- ACKNOWLEDGE TWO

531
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
THINGS.

532
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
ONE IS THE STRONGEST

533
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
CONCEIVABLE GUN CONTROL LAWS

534
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
WON'T STOP ALL ACTS OF

535
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
VIOLENCE.
BUT ALSO, TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

536
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
THE STRONGER OUR GUN CONTROL

537
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
LAWS ARE, THE FEWER ACTS OF

538
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
VIOLENCE, INCLUDING MASS

539
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
VIOLENCE THAT WILL HAPPEN ON

540
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
OUR SOCIETY.

541
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
SO, AS A RESULT OF THE BRADY

542
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
LAW, AND IT STILL EXISTS.

543
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
IF YOU GO IT NOAH A LICENSED

544
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
FIREARM DEALER YOU HAVE A

545
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
BACKGROUND CHECK AND IT'S A

546
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
THOROUGH ONE.

547
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
IF YOU BUY A GUN FROM SOMEBODY

548
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
WHO IS NOT LICENSED OR AT A

549
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
GUN SHOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE

550
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
CHECKED AT ALL.

551
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
THAT'S A LOOPHOLE THAT WE

552
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
OUGHT TO CLOSE.

553
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS, THESE WERE

554
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
DEVELOPED BY THE U.S. MILITARY

555
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
ORIGINALLY AS WEAPONS OF WAR.

556
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO

557
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
RESTORE THAT ASSAULT WEAPONS

558
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
BAN BECAUSE NOT TO TAKE

559
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
ANYBODY'S GUNS AWAY FROM THEM

560
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
THAT THEY HAVE NOW.

561
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
BUT IT TO STOP THE MANUFACTURE

562
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
AND SALE OF THOSE WEAPONS NOW

563
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
BECAUSE LOOK WHAT LANZA DID TO

564
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
THESE POOR TALK ABOUT A COUPLE

565
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
OF OTHER THINGS.

566
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
MENTAL ILLNESS.
>> YEAH.

567
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
>> THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A

568
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
DISTURBED BOY.

569
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
>> CORRECT.
>> SOME OTHER CASES HOLMES IN

570
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
AURORA DISTURBED.

571
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY

572
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
THERE IS SOME STATISTICS ABOUT

573
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
KIDS WILL HAVE WATCHED

574
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
THOUSANDS OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE

575
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
ON VIDEOS, ON GAMES AND MOVIES

576
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
AND TV BY THE TIME, YOU KNOW,

577
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
THEY ARE 10.

578
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
SPECIFICALLY, WHAT KIND OF

579
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
THING CAN WE DO ABOUT THAT?

580
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
>> THAT'S WHY I THINK WE NEED

581
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
A NATIONAL COMMISSION.

582
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I WILL TELL YOU I SPENT ENOUGH

583
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
TIME ON THIS QUESTION OF

584
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
VIOLENCE IN THE ENTERTAINMENT

585
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
CULTURE TO REACH THIS

586
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
CONCLUSION.

587
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
THAT THE VIOLENCE IN THE

588
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
ENTERTAINMENT CULTURE

589
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
PARTICULARLY WITH THE
EXTRAORDINARY REALISM TO VIDEO

590
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
GAME MOVIES ET CETERA DOES

591
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
CAUSE VULNERABLE YOUNG MEN,

592
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
PARTICULARLY TO BEING MORE

593
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
VIOLENT IT.
DOESN'T MAKE EVERYBODY MORE

594
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
VIOLENT BUT IT'S A CAUSATIVE

595
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
FACTOR IN SOME CASES.

596
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
WE HAVE GOT TO ASK THE

597
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY WHAT

598
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
ARE TONE IT DOWN.

599
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
>> Chris: PASS A LAW.

600
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
>> IN OUR SOCIETY YOU TRY TO

601
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
DO IT VOLUNTARILY, YOU HAVE

602
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
COME TO A POINT TO SAY IF NOT

603
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
MAYBE THERE IS SOME THINGS WE

604
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
CAN DO TO TONE IT DOWN.

605
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
THERE IS A BETTER RATING

606
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
SYSTEM NOW THAN THERE USED TO

607
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
BE ON VIDEO GAMES AND VIOLENT

608
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
MOVIES.
THEY ARE STILL OUT THERE.

609
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MENTAL

610
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
HEALTH SYSTEM.

611
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I THINK WE HAVE REALLY GOT TO

612
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
ASK OURSELVES FIRST OFF THIS

613
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
IS LIKE THE SLOGAN THAT WE USE

614
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
IN HOMELAND SECURITY.

615
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.

616
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
WE HAVE GOT TO ASK PARENTS,

617
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
FRIENDS, SCHOOL OFFICIALS IF

618
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
YOU SEE A CHILD, A YOUNG

619
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
PERSON THAT REALLY LOOKS LIKE

620
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
THEY ARE POTENTIALLY REALLY

621
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
TROUBLESOME, GET THEM MENTAL

622
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
HELP.
AND THEN WE HAVE GOT TO ASK

623
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
OURSELVES AS A SOCIETY, IS

624
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
THERE ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH

625
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
HELP AVAILABLE FOR THESE KIDS?

626
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
THERE IS IS NO CURE.

627
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
VIOLENCE IS AS OLD AS CAIN

628
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
KILLING HIS BROTHER ABLE.

629
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
BUT GOD DIDN'T ACCEPT THAT AS

630
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
A GIVEN AND SAID IF I MAY TO

631
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
CAIN, WHERE IS YOUR BROTHER?

632
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
AND ABLE, CAIN SAYS AM I MY

633
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
BROTHER'S KEEPER?
AND GOD SAYS ESSENTIALLY YES.

634
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I HEAR YOUR BROTHER'S BLOOD

635
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
CRYING OUT TO ME FROM THE

636
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
GROUND.

637
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
AND I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO

638
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
CONTINUE TO HEAR THE SCREAMS

639
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
OF THESE CHILDREN AND SEE

640
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
THEIR BLOOD UNTIL WE DO

641
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
SOMETHING TO TRY TO PREVENT

642
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

643
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
VIGIL TONIGHT.

644
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
THANK YOU, SIR EVERYWHERE.

645
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
>> Chris: UP NEXT, WITH
ANOTHER MASS MURDER, NEW CALLS

646
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
FOR GUN CONTROL IS NOW THE

647
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
RIGHT TIME?
AS OUR COVERAGE OF THE SCHOOL

648
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
TRAGEDY IN CONNECTICUT

649
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
CONTINUES.

650
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
SUGGESTING IS NOW TIME TO

651
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
REOPEN THE NATIONAL DEBATE ON

652
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
GUN CONTROL.
AS HORRIFIC AS THIS SHOOTING

653
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
HAS BEEN WE HAVE WITHIN HERE

654
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
BEFORE AS A NATION.

655
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE INTEREST

656
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
IN THE LAST DECADE IN

657
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
TIGHTENING GUN LAWS.

658
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
JOINING ME NOW IS DICK DURBIN

659
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
IN HIS HOME STATE OF ILLINOIS.

660
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
SENATOR, HOW DO YOU READ THE

661
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS THAT WE

662
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
JUST PLAYED?

663
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
IS IT TIME FOR A NEW PUSH,

664
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
TIGHTER GUN CONTROL?

665
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
>> WELL, FIRST, LET ME SAY THE

666
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
NATION IS IN MOURNING AND

667
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
REFLECTION AND PRAYER OVER

668
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN NEWTOWN,

669
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
CONNECTICUT THERE ISN'T A

670
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
PARENT OR GRANDPARENT THAT

671
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
DIDN'T VISUALIZE SOME SOMEONE

672
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
THEY LOVE SUBJECTED TO THIS

673
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
KIND OF VIOLENCE WHY NEED A

674
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
NATIONAL CONVERSATION OF THE

675
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
JOE LIEBERMAN CALLED.

676
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
WE NEED A NATIONAL

677
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
CONVERSATION ABOUT SAFETY.

678
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I WOULD GO BEYOND JOE AND SAY

679
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
LET'S ADD THAT ISSUE OF SCHOOL

680
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
SAFETY INTO THIS CONVERSATION

681
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
AS WELL.

682
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
GUN CONTROL IS PART OF IT WE

683
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
NEED TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A

684
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
QUIET CALM REFLECTION ON THE

685
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
SECOND AMENDMENT?

686
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
ARE THERE GUNS THAT SHOULDN'T

687
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
BE SOLD ACROSS AMERICA.

688
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
MILITARY ASSAULT WEAPONS SUCH

689
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
AS THE ONE INVOLVED IN THIS

690
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
HORRIFIC INCIDENT N

691
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
CONNECTICUT?
ARE THERE HIGH AM MISSION

692
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
CLIPS?
HIGH CLIPS THAT HAVE NO VALUE

693
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
WHATSOEVER WHEN IT COMES TO

694
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
SPORTING AND HUNTING AND EVEN

695
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
SELF-DEFENSE.

696
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
THAT A PERSON COULD BUY BODY

697
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
ARMOR, TAKE THAT BODY ARMOR

698
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
AND USE IT TO PROTECT

699
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
THEMSELVES AS THEY KILL

700
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
INNOCENT PEOPLE?

701
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
CAN WE HAVE A THOUGHTFUL, CALM

702
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
REFLECTION ON THESE THINGS DO

703
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
IT IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR

704
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
SECOND AMENDMENT?
I THINK WE NEED TO.

705
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
>> Chris: THE PRESIDENT AS WE

706
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
HAD IN THAT CLIP MENTIONED

707
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
REGARDLESS OF POLITICS AND THE

708
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
FACT IS THAT WE HAD THAT

709
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
SLAUGHTER OF PEOPLE AT THE
MOVIE THEATER IN AURORA,

710
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
COLORADO JUST IN JULY AT THAT

711
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
TIME YOU SAID YOU SUPPORTED A

712
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS.

713
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
YOU ALSO SAID.

714
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
>> I DO.

715
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
>> Chris: BACK AT THAT TIME

716
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
THERE IS ZERO CHANCE THAT

717
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
CONGRESS WILL PASS THAT.

718
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
IT'S NOT JUST REPUBLICANS,

719
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
QUITE FRANKLY AS I POINTED OUT

720
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
TO JOE LIEBERMAN YOUR PARTY

721
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
HAS BEEN AFRAID BECAUSE OF

722
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
POLITICS TO PUSH THIS FOR THE

723
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
LAST DECADE.

724
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
CHRIS, THERE IS PLENTY OF

725
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
BLAME ON BOTH SIDES

726
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
POLITICALLY.

727
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
THERE IS ALSO A RESPONSIBILITY
OF THE PEOPLE ACROSS THIS

728
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
NATION I WOULD APPEAL TO THE

729
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
HUNTERS AND SPORTSMEN I KNOW

730
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
THEM.
THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE.

731
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
THEY LOVE THEIR FAMILIES.

732
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
THEY HEAR WHAT THEY ARE
HEARING ABOUT NEW TOWN,

733
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
CONNECTICUT BUT THEY HAVE BEEN

734
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
LARGELY QUIET.

735
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
THIS CONVERSATION HAS BEEN

736
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
DOMINATED IN WASHINGTON BY,

737
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
YOU KNOW AND I KNOW, GUN

738
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
LOBBIES THAT HAVE AN AGENDA.

739
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
WE NEED FOR HERMINE, JUST

740
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
ORDINARY AMERICANS TO COME

741
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
TOGETHER AND SPEAK OUT AND TO

742
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
SIT DOWN AND CALMLY REFLECT ON

743
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
HOW FAR WE GO.

744
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'M GOING TO BE HOLDING A

745
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
HEARING AFTER THE FIRST OF THE

746
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
YEAR IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS OR SO

747
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
ON THIS CONSTITUTIONAL

748
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
QUESTION.
THAT'S THE STARTING POINT.

749
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
THE SUPREME COURT RAISED

750
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SECOND

751
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
AMENDMENT, WHAT ARE THE

752
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
PROTECTIONS?

753
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
WHAT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITIES?

754
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
LET'S SPELL THIS OUT?

755
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
AND LET'S TRY TO DO IT IN A

756
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
THOUGHTFUL WAY AND MOVE

757
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
FORWARD TOGETHER.
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED.

758
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
>> Chris: LET'S DEAL WITH SOME

759
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST NEW GUN

760
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
LAWS.
THE FACT IS THAT CONNECTICUT

761
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
SENATOR AS YOU PELL KNOW HAS

762
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
SOME OF THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS

763
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
IN THE COUNTRY.

764
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
NANCY LANZA, THE MOTHER OF THE

765
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
SHOOTER HAD BOUGHT AND

766
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
REGISTERED THESE GUNS LEGALLY.

767
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
WHAT MORE CAN WE DO?

768
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
>> WELL, LISTEN, WHY IN THE

769
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
WORLD WOULD ANYONE, EVEN NANCY

770
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
LANZA NEED A MILITARY ASSAULT

771
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
WEAPON DESIGNED FOR THE

772
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
MILITARY THAT HAS THE CAPACITY

773
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
TO FIRE OFF HUNDREDS OF

774
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
ROUNDS?

775
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
HEART BREAKING TO HEAR THIS

776
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
CORONER SPEAK ABOUT THESE POOR

777
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
LITTLE KIDS WHOSE BODIES WERE

778
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
RIDDLED WITH BULLETS FOR

779
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
GOODNESS SAKES.
CAN WE STOP FOR A MOMENT AND

780
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
REFLECT ON THIS?

781
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I'M ALL FOR SPORT AND HUNTING

782
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
AND SELF-DEFENSE.

783
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
THIS GOES WAY BEYOND THAT.

784
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
>> Chris: FINALLY, SENATOR,

785
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
BLAB THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAY AND

786
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
OUR NEXT GUEST CONGRESSMAN

787
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
GOHMERT IS ONE OF THEM THAT

788
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
THE REAL ANSWER IS NOT FEWER

789
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
GUNS BUT MORE GUNS SO THAT IF

790
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
A PERSON LIKE THIS COMES TO A

791
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
MOVIE THEATER OR A MALL OR A

792
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
SCHOOL, SOMEBODY IS THERE WHO

793
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
CAN TAKE THEM DOWN.

794
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
>> I JUST -- I HONESTLY THINK

795
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
THAT THAT ARGUMENT U.S. IS --

796
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
ARGUMENT JUST DOESN'T HOLD

797
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
WATER.

798
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
TALKING ABOUT ARMING TEACHERS

799
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
AND PRINCIPALS?

800
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
IS THAT GOING TO MAKE US A

801
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
SAFER AMERICA?

802
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I DON'T THINK SO.
TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE HARMED BY

803
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
FIREARMS, THEIR OWN FIREARMS

804
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
THAT ARE ACCIDENTLY MISUSED OR

805
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
TURN ON THEM.

806
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I DON'T HAPPEN TO BUY THAT

807
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
APPROACH AT ALL.

808
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I WANT TO SIT DOWN AND CALMLY

809
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
DISCUSS ALL THE OPTIONS.

810
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT AS

811
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
A NATION.

812
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN

813
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
MOVE FORWARD AND MAKE SURE

814
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
THAT THERE IS A LESSON TO BE

815
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
LEARNED IN NEW TOWN

816
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
CONNECTICUT.
>> LET ME JUST ASK YOU AFTER

817
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
AURORA YOU SAID THERE WAS ZERO

818
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
CHANCE CONGRESS WOULD PASS A

819
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
NEW LAW.

820
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
DO YOU STILL SAY ZERO CHANCE?

821
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
>> NO.

822
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN

823
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
NEW TOWN, CONNECTICUT, MAY AT

824
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
LEAST LEAD SOME TO FINALLY

825
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
DECIDE TO SIT DOWN AND TO HAVE

826
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
THIS CONVERSATION.

827
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I REALLY THINK WE MAY HAVE A

828
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
CHANCE BECAUSE OF THIS

829
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

830
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AFTER

831
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
9/11.

832
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
IT CAN HAPPEN AFTER NEW TOWN

833
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
CONNECTICUT AS WELL.

834
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
>> Chris: SENATOR DURBIN,

835
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US

836
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
TODAY, SIR.

837
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> THE CORE OF THE DEBATE GOES

838
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
TO A BASIC CONSTITUTIONAL

839
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
PROVISION THE RIGHT TO BEAR

840
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
ARMS.
DOES THIS TRAGEDY CHANGE OR

841
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
LIMIT THAT?

842
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
JOINING ME NOW REPUBLICAN

843
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
CONGRESSMAN LOUIE GOHMERT OF

844
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
TEXAS.
CONGRESSMAN, WELCOME.

845
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU,

846
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
CHRIS.

847
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
>> Chris: ATTORNEY GENERAL
HOLDER SPOKE OUT ABOUT THE

848
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
SHOOTING ON FRIDAY.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HE

849
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
SAID.

850
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
>> WE NEED TO DISCUSS WHO WE

851
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
ARE AS A NATION.

852
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
TALK ABOUT THE FREEDOMS THAT

853
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
WE HAVE.
THE RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE, AND

854
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
HOW THOSE MIGHT BE USED IN A

855
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
RESPONSIBLE WAY.

856
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
>> Chris: WHAT DO YOU THINK

857
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
ABOUT HIS COMMENTS ABOUT OUR

858
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
RIGHTS AND OUR FREEDOMS BEING

859
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
USED IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY?

860
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
>> WELL, I THINK COMING FROM

861
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
HIM, THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

862
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
TO NOTE.

863
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
COMING FROM A MAN WHO IS OVER

864
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
A DEPARTMENT THAT FORCED THE

865
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
SALE OF GUNS TO PEOPLE THAT

866
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
WOULD BRING ABOUT THE DEATH OF

867
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
PEOPLE LIKE BRIAN TERRY AND

868
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
THERE SHOULD BE NATIONAL

869
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
OUTRAGE ABOUT MEXICANS, OUR

870
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
NEIGHBORS, 200 OR MORE THAT

871
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE GUNS

872
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
THAT HIS DEPARTMENT HAVE

873
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
FORCIBLY OR FORCED TO BE SOLD.

874
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
SO, HE IS RIGHT.

875
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
AND REALLY, SENATOR DURBIN IS

876
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
RIGHT.
BUT THE CONVERSATION WE HAVE

877
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
GOT TO HAVE HAS GOT TO HAVE

878
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
EVERYBODY OPEN-MINDED.

879
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I MEAN, WE ALL REACT

880
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
EMOTIONALLY, THAT'S WHY WE

881
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
HAVE ALL SHED TEARS AND OUR

882
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
PRAYERS WILL CONTINUE TO GO

883
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
FOR THE PEOPLE IN CONNECTICUT

884
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES.

885
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
>> Chris: AFTER THE MOVIE HERE

886
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
IS THE SHOOTING IN JULY IN

887
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
AURORA, COLORADO, YOU SAID

888
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
WHAT WE NEED IS MORE PEOPLE

889
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
CARRYING WEAPONS SO THAT IF A

890
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
SHOOTER COMES INTO A MOVIE
THEATER WITH A GUN, SOMEBODY

891
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
CAN STAND UP AND DEFEND HIM

892
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
AND DEFEND OTHER PEOPLE.

893
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
QUESTION:  AND THIS IS THE

894
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
QUESTION DICK DURBIN HAD.

895
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
DO WE REALLY WANT FOLKS IN

896
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
MOVIE THEATERS, AND MALLS AND

897
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
SCHOOLS ARMED?
>> ONCE WE HAVE THIS ACTUALLY

898
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
OPEN DIALOGUE ABOUT EVER EVERY

899
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
MASS KILLING OF PEOPLE IN

900
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
RECENT HISTORY HAS BEEN IN A

901
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
PLACE WHERE GUNS WERE

902
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
PROHIBITED.

903
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
THESE GUN -- EXCEPT FOR ONE.

904
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THEY CHOOSE THIS PLACE, THEY

905
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
KNOW NO ONE WILL BE ARMED.

906
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
YOU KNOW, HAVING BEEN A JUDGE

907
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
AND HAVING REVIEWED

908
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THESE HORRIFIC

909
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
SCENES AND KNOWING THAT

910
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
CHILDREN HAVE THESE DEFENSIVE

911
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
WOUNDS, GUNSHOTS THROUGH THEIR

912
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
ARMS AND HANDS AS THEY TRY TO

913
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
PROTECT THEMSELVES, AND

914
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
HEARING THE HEROIC STORIES OF

915
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
THE PRINCIPAL LUNGING TRYING

916
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
TO PROTECT, CHRIS, I WISH TO

917
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
GOD SHE HAD HAD AN M 4 IN HER

918
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
OFFICE LOCKED UP SO THAT WHEN

919
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
SHE HEARD GUNFIRE SHE PULLS IT

920
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
OUT AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO

921
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
LUNGE HEROICALLY WITH NOTHING

922
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
IN HIS HANDS TAKES HIM OUT AND

923
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
TAKES HIS HEAD OFF BEFORE HE

924
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
COULD KILL THOSE PRECIOUS

925
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
KIDS.

926
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
>> Chris: I UNDERSTAND THE
RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS AND THE

927
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
SUPREME COURT MEANT SUPREME

928
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
COURT WAS CLEAR WHEN THEY PUT

929
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS IN THE

930
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
CONSTITUTION.
LET ME ASK YOU THE QUESTION

931
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
DICK DURBIN ASKED.

932
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
WHY DO PEOPLE NEED THESE

933
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS?

934
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I WAS READING ABOUT THE GLOCK

935
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
HE HAD AND THE SIGSOWER HE

936
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
HAD.
FIVE BULLETS A SECOND BUSH

937
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
MASTER.
THESE WERE CREATED FOR LAW

938
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
ENFORCEMENT.

939
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
THESE WERE CREATED FOR THE

940
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
MILITARY.
WHY DOES THE AVERAGE PERSON.

941
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I CAN UNDERSTAND HUNTING RIFLE

942
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
AND HUNTING GUN.

943
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
WHY DO THESE WEAPONS OF MASS

944
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
DESTRUCTION.

945
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
>> FOR THE REASON THAT GEORGE

946
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
WASHINGTON SAID.
A FREE PEOPLE SHOULD BE AN

947
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
ARMED PEOPLE.

948
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
IT ENSURES AGAINST THE TYRANNY

949
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
OF THE GOVERNMENT.

950
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
IF THEY KNOW THAT THE BIGGEST

951
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
ARMY IS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,

952
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE

953
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
TYRANNY THAT CAME FROM KING

954
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
GEORGE.
THAT'S WHY IT WAS PUT IN

955
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
THERE.
THAT'S WHY ONCE YOU START

956
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
DRAWING THE LINE WHERE DO YOU

957
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
STOP?

958
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
AND THAT'S WHY IT IS IMPORTANT

959
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
TO NOT JUST LOOK EMOTIONALLY.

960
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
OUR REACTION IS TO IMMEDIATELY

961
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
SAY LET'S GET RID OF ALL GUNS.

962
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
YOU DO AS IT A JUDGE.

963
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
YOU REACT EMOTIONALLY BUT YOU

964
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
USE YOUR HEAD AND YOU LOOK AT

965
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
THE FACTS.

966
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
AND THE FACTS ARE THAT EVERY

967
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
TIME GUNS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED,

968
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
CONCEAL CARRIES HAVE BEEN

969
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
ALLOWED.

970
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
THE CRIME RATE HAS GONE DOWN.

971
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
WASHINGTON, D.C. AROUND US

972
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
OUGHT TO BE THE SAFEST PLACE

973
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
IN AMERICA.
AND IT'S NOT.

974
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
CHICAGO OUGHT TO BE SAFE.

975
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
IT'S NOT.

976
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
BECAUSE THEIR GUN LAWS DON'T

977
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
WORK.
>> Chris: CONGRESSMAN, THANK

978
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING IN TODAY.

979
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
WE WILL SEE WHERE THIS DEBATE

980
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
COMES FROM HERE.

981
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
>> THANKS SO MUCH.

982
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
>> Chris: UP NEXT, WE WILL

983
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
TALK WITH AN EXPERT ABOUT WHAT

984
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
CAN BE DONE TO MAKE OUR

985
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
SCHOOLS SAFER.

986
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
THEN OUR SUNDAY PANEL AS WE

987
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
CONTINUE OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE

988
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
OF THE TRAGEDY IN THE

989
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
CLASSROOM.

990
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
>> Chris: THE SANDY HOOK

991
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING CONFRONT SOME

992
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
QUESTIONS IS MY CHILD'S SCHOOL

993
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
AS SAFE AS IT SHOULD BE.

994
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE?

995
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
JOINING ME NOW FROM CALABASAS,

996
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
CALIFORNIA, IS RONALD STEVENS,

997
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL

998
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
SCHOOL SAFETY CENTER.

999
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
SHEAND HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

1000
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
HAD RECENTLY INSTALLED A NEW

1001
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
SECURITY SYSTEM.

1002
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
THE DOORS WERE LOCKED AT 9:30.

1003
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
YOU HAD TO BE BUZZED IN.

1004
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
TO GET INTO THE SCHOOL.

1005
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
BUT POLICE SAY THE SHOOTER

1006
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
FORCED HIS WAY IN SO I GUESS

1007
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT MORE CAN

1008
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
A SCHOOL DO?

1009
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
>> IT'S A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE

1010
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
FOR SCHOOL OFFICIALS BECAUSE

1011
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
SCHOOL CAMPUSES ARE NOT

1012
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
DESIGNED TO BE FORTRESSES TO

1013
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
BE DEFENDED.

1014
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
THEY ARE PLACES OF LEARNING.

1015
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
SO, THE EXPECTATION FOR

1016
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
SCHOOLS IS THAT THEY WOULD

1017
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
TAKE REASONABLE STEPS AND WHEN

1018
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
WE LOOK AT THE COMPASSION AND

1019
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
CARE AND SACRIFICE OF THE

1020
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
ADMINISTRATORS AND TEACHERS,

1021
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE

1022
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS BUT

1023
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
BUNS AGAIN IF YOU HAVE AN

1024
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
ARMED GETTING ON TO THE CAMPUS

1025
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
THEY WILL USE USE WHATEVER

1026
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
MEANS NECESSARY.

1027
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
NOT UNCOMMON SITUATION WHERE

1028
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
THEY DEFEAT SOME THE BEST

1029
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN PLACE.

1030
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
>> Chris: I WAS FASCINATED,

1031
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
MR. STEVENS, BY HOW MUCH

1032
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
SECURITY AND I DIDN'T REALIZE

1033
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
THIS A LOT OF OUR PUBLIC

1034
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE, LET'S

1035
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE

1036
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
SECURITY MEASURES THAT ARE

1037
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
ALREADY THERE.

1038
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
92% OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS LOCK OR

1039
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
MONITOR THEIR DOORS.

1040
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
61% USE SECURITY CAMERAS.

1041
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
63% USE ELECTRONIC

1042
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
NOTIFICATION FOR A SCHOOL

1043
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
EMERGENCY.
WHAT ARE THE BIG GAPS YOU

1044
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
STILL SEE OUT THERE, SIR?

1045
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
>> ONE OF THE BIGGEST GAPS

1046
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
THAT I SEE IS THAT SCHOOLS SO

1047
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
OFTEN ARE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR

1048
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
NOT SUPPOSED TO EVER BE

1049
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
LETTING THESE KINDS OF

1050
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
INCIDENTS OCCUR.

1051
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
AND, YET, THE SCHOOLS REFLECT

1052
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
SO MUCH WHAT'S GOING ON IN

1053
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
SOCIETY.

1054
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
WE WANT SCHOOLS TO TAKE STEPS

1055
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
THAT ARE APPROPRIATE BUT THERE

1056
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
ARE LIMITATIONS AND UNTIL

1057
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
SOMEONE IS ABLE TO CONTROL THE

1058
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
HUMAN MIND IN THESE CHOICES

1059
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
THAT ARE MADE BY DERANGED

1060
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
INDIVIDUALS, IT'S GOING TO BE

1061
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
VERY DIFFICULT.
I THINK THIS NATIONAL

1062
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
CONVERSATION THAT WE ARE

1063
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
TALKING ABOUT HAS TO GO BEYOND

1064
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
SCHOOLS IN THE COMMUNITIES AND

1065
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
TO HOMES INTO.

1066
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
GATHER.

1067
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
KEEP OUR SAFER.

1068
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
>> Chris: YOU HEARD WHAT

1069
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
CONGRESSMAN GOHMERT JUST SAID,

1070
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
DO WE NEED ARMED GUARDS INSIDE

1071
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
SCHOOLS?
DO WE NEED A TEACHER OR SOME

1072
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
KIND OF PERSONNEL, THE

1073
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
PRINCIPAL WHO KNOWS AND HAS

1074
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
HOW TO FIRE AND HAS A WEAPON

1075
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
WITH HIM?

1076
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
>> I WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO

1077
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
HAVE ARMED GUARDS IN THE

1078
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
SCHOOLS.
AND, YET, THE KINDS OF THINGS

1079
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
THAT ARE HAPPENING NOW HAS

1080
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
BEEN ONE OF THE CHIEF ITEMS

1081
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
THAT HAS ENCOURAGED THE

1082
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
PRESENCE OF SCHOOL RESOURCE

1083
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
OFFICERS ALL ACROSS THE

1084
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
COUNTRY.
BUT, EVEN ON THE BEST OF DAYS,

1085
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
TO ASSUME THAT THE OFFICER

1086
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
WILL ALWAYS BE IN THE RIGHT

1087
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AT THE

1088
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
RIGHT MOMENT IS DIFFICULT.

1089
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
YOU LOOK AT RED LAKE, MINUTE

1090
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
SOCIETY THAT HAD OFFICERS AT

1091
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
THE SCHOOLHOUSE GATE AS WELL

1092
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
AS METAL DETECTORS AND YET THE

1093
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
ASSAILANT COMES, IN TAKES OUT

1094
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
THE OFFICER, WALKS RIGHT

1095
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
THROUGH THE METAL DETECTORS.

1096
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
THERE ARE THINGS THAT

1097
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
OFTENTIMES SIMPLY CAN'T.

1098
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
SCOPE AND CONTROL OF SCHOOL

1099
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
OFFICIALS THAT THESE ARE ARE

1100
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE

1101
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
FACE.

1102
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
>> ONE THING THAT SEEMED

1103
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR FROM WHAT

1104
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
HAPPENED AT SANDY HOOK IS THEY

1105
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
HAVE DONE A LOT OF TRAINING

1106
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
THERE HAD BEEN A LOT OF SAFETY

1107
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
DRILLS AND IT SURE SEEMED, IN

1108
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
TERMS OF THE RESPONSE IN THE

1109
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
CLASSROOMS AND EVACUATING THE
KIDS FROM THE SCHOOL THAT SURE

1110
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
SEEMED TO MAKE A BIG

1111
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
DIFFERENCE IN SAVING LIVES.

1112
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
>> WELL, IT ABSOLUTELY DID.

1113
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
AND WE'RE PROBABLY A LOT

1114
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
BETTER AT CRISIS RESPONSE THAN

1115
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000

00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
WHEN THE DEMOCRATS RESTORED

1297
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
EVERYTHING IN 2009, 2010.

1298
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
SO I'M TOTALLY OPEN TO HAVING

1299
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
SERIOUS -- A LOT OF SOCIAL

1300
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
SCIENCE RESEARCH ON GUN

1301
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
CONTROL.

1302
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I DON'T THINK IT'S FAVORABLE
TO MOST EFFORTS OF GUN

1303
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
CONTROL.

1304
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I THINK EVERYTHING HAS TO BE

1305
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
ON THE TABLE TOO.

1306
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
IS IT GUN FREE ZONES.

1307
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
MAYBE HAVING SECURITY GUARDS

1308
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
THAN HAVING DO BACKGROUND

1309
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
CHECKS IN A CASE WHERE THE

1310
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
PURCHASE OF THE GUNS IN THIS

1311
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
CASE PASS BACKGROUND CHECK.

1312
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
CONNECTICUT IS A PRETTY

1313
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
LIBERAL STATE.
I BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

1314
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
CONTROLS ALL THE BRANCHES OF

1315
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
GOVERNMENT IN CONNECTICUT.

1316
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
THEY CHOSE NOT TO BAN THE

1317
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
THINGS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.

1318
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I GUESS.

1319
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
THEY COULD HAVE.
COULDN'T THEY?

1320
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
>> STATE LAWS ARE USELESS.

1321
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
CAN YOU ORDER THINGS ONLINE

1322
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
NOW.
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT -- I'M

1323
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
JUST SAYING LET'S HAVE AN

1324
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
HONEST DEBATE AND PRIVACY

1325
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
LAWS, MENTAL HEALTH.

1326
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I DO THINK THE REPUBLICAN

1327
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
PARTY SHOULDN'T BE IN A

1328
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
POSITION OF SAYING YOU CAN'T

1329
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
EVEN DISCUSS.

1330
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
THIS I THINK THE SPEAKER COULD

1331
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
EASILY ASK CONTROL ONE HOUSE

1332
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
OF CONGRESS, SENATOR REID

1333
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
COULD THIS ON THE OTHER SIDE.

1334
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
HAVE SIROUS HEARINGS ABOUT THE

1335
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
LEGAL ISSUES AND THE PUBLIC

1336
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
POLICY ISSUES.

1337
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
>> Chris: YOU KNOW, LIZ, I'M

1338
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
SURE THAT SOME OF OUR

1339
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
LISTENERS LISTENED TO THIS

1340
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
TALK ABOUT JOE LIEBERMAN

1341
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
CALLING FOR A COMMISSION OR

1342
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
BILL KRISTOL CALLING FOR

1343
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
HEARINGS.
AND I DON'T MEAN THIS IN A

1344
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
BELITTLING WAY.
THEY THINK WE HAVE HEARD THIS

1345
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
ALL BEFORE.

1346
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
THAT JUST MEANS WE WILL HAVE

1347
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
SOME DOCUMENTS, WE'LL HAVE

1348
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
SOME HEARINGS AND NOTHING WILL

1349
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
HAPPEN.

1350
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
AND MAYBE NOTHING SHOULD

1351
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
HAPPEN.

1352
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WILL SIT

1353
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
THERE AND SAY MORE OF THE

1354
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
SAME.
>> AND THAT IS POSSIBLE.

1355
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I THINK I AGREE WITH NINA THAT

1356
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
THIS FEELS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A

1357
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
TIPPING POINT.
AND ONE OF THE PHRASES YOU

1358
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
KEEP HEARING IS THAT PEOPLE

1359
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
ARE FED UP.

1360
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
THERE SEEMS TO BE THIS DESIRE

1361
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
FOR ACTION.

1362
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
NOT JUST A COMMISSION OR A

1363
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
REPORT OR A DEBATE OR A

1364
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
NATIONAL DEBATE.
THERE SEEMS TO BE A STRONGER

1365
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
DESIRE FOR LET'S FIND SOME

1366
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
CONCRETE STEPS MAYBE THAT WE

1367
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
CAN TAKE RIGHT AWAY.

1368
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
EVEN IF THEY MAKE ONLY A

1369
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
SLIGHT DIFFERENCE.

1370
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
MAYBE THAT WILL EFFECT IT IT I

1371
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
ALSO WONDER IF THE POLITICS OF

1372
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
THIS MIGHT CHANGE.

1373
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
WE ARE SEEN, YOU KNOW, OVER

1374
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
THE LAST FEW DECADES, GALLUP

1375
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
HAS SHOWN SUPPORT FOR GUN

1376
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
CONTROL HAS FALLEN OFF PRETTY

1377
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
DRAMATICALLY.

1378
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
YOU WONDER IF IN THE WAKE OF

1379
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
THIS PAST ELECTION THE

1380
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
DEMOCRATIC COALITION SEEMS TO

1381
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
BE CHANGING SOMEWHAT.

1382
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
YOU WONDER IF DEMOCRATIC

1383
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
POLITICIANS MAY NOT SEE THIS

1384
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
AS SUCH A THIRD RAIL ISSUE AS

1385
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
THEY HAD AS YOU SAID WITH

1386
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
LIEBERMAN AFTER THE 2000

1387
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
ELECTION AND IN RECENT YEARS.

1388
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
>> YOU KNOW, BRIT, ONE OF THE

1389
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
THINGS THAT I VALUE MOST ABOUT

1390
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
YOU IS WHEN EVERYBODY IS

1391
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
RUSHING IN ONE DIRECTION, YOU

1392
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
ARE A CONTRARIAN AND YOU SAY

1393
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
WAIT A MINUTE.

1394
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

1395
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
HERE.
REALLY.
WE DON'T.

1396
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

1397
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
INSIDE THAT ELM.
WHO WE DON'T KNOW WHY FOR SURE

1398
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
THIS WOMAN SEEMED COMPELLED TO

1399
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
BUY ALL THESE WEAPONS IF

1400
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
INDEED THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

1401
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS

1402
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
YOUNG MAN.
WE NEED TO KNOW ALL OF THAT

1403
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
BEFORE WE MAKE -- START MAKING

1404
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
ANY POLICY PREDICTIONS.

1405
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
WE ALSO NEED TO FIND OUT AS

1406
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
BEST WE CAN WHAT INFLUENCES

1407
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
WITHIN THE CULTURE HAVE

1408
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
CREATED THIS -- MAY HAVE

1409
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
HELPED TO CREATE THIS WAVE OF

1410
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
VIOLENCE.

1411
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
PERHAPS A DECENTIZATION TO

1412
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
VIOLENCE.
YOU SEE IT ON THE SCREEN.

1413
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY THERE IS

1414
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
NO PERHAPS.

1415
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
THERE HAS BEEN.

1416
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I SEE MY KIDS PLAYING THESE

1417
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
GAMES WHERE THEY ARE SOLDIERS.

1418
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
>> LOOK, I PLAYED A LOT OF

1419
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
GUNS WHEN I WAS A KID.

1420
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
SEE A LOT OF COWBOY WESTERNS.

1421
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
>> Chris: IT'S DIFFERENT.

1422
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
>> I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU.

1423
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
THAT NEEDS TO BE PART OF IT.

1424
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT AS

1425
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
YELL.

1426
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
THERE IS A LOT IN THIS.

1427
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
IF THERE IS GOING TO BE

1428
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
INVESTIGATION IT SHOULDN'T
FOCUS ON SINGLE ISSUE IT

1429
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
SHOULD FOCUS ON ALL THE THINGS

1430
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO

1431
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
THIS SO WE GET A BETTER

1432
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
PICTURE OF IT.

1433
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
>> Chris: WHAT ABOUT THE

1434
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
AVERAGEMENT IF YOU HAVE THE

1435
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
COMMISSIONS AND YOU HAVE THE

1436
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
HEARINGS, NOTHING HAPPENS?

1437
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
>> THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE

1438
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
CASE.

1439
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
YOU HAVE COMMISSIONS AND

1440
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
HEARINGS AND SOMETIMES THINGS
DO HAPPEN.

1441
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
WE HAD A BIG COMMISSION AFTER

1442
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
9/11 AND THINGS DID HAPPEN.

1443
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
SO, IT WILL DEPEND, I THINK ON

1444
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
THE EXTINCT TO WHICH THE

1445
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE HAS BEEN

1446
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
CHANGED BY THE HORROR AT THIS

1447
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
HAVE.

1448
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
>> Chris: YOU GET THE FINAL

1449
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
WORD.

1450
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
>> I WAS GOING TO JUMP.

1451
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
IN IT HAS TO BE SEEN IN THE

1452
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
CONTEXT OF THIS INCIDENT AND

1453
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
THE CONTEXT OF ALL THESE OTHER

1454
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
INCIDENTS AND THE

1455
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
COMMONALITIES ARE THERE WERE

1456
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
WARNINGS.
IT INVOLVED MENTALLY UNSTABLE

1457
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
PEOPLE AND SEMIAUTOMATIC

1458
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
WEAPONS.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WILL FIND IS

1459
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
COMMON IN ALL OF THESE

1460
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
MURDERS.

1461
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
