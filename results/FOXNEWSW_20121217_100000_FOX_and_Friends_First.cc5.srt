AND TAX RAKES FOR HIGH INCOME

355
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE TO LIVE

356
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
THERE.
UNEMPLOYMENT IS HIGH AND

357
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000

IT REALLY IS NOT POPULAR IN THE

HONEST WITH OURSELVES, THE

695
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
ANSWER IS NO.

HE ASKED WHETHER THE NATION WAS

00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
DOING ENOUGH TO PROTECT THE

722
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
CHILDREN.

723
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T SAY WHAT

KIND OF CHANGE HE WOULD ADVOCATE

725
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
EVEN SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS SAY

726
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
HE NEEDS TO PUSH FOR SOMETHING

727
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
COMPREHENSIBLE.

FORWARD AND MAKE SURE THERE'S A

733
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
LESSON TO BE LEARNED IN NEWTOWN,

WILL PLAY OUT.

738
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000

I'm Kirk Cameron. Four Hundred

911
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000

FORCED HIS WAY INTO THE SCHOOL.

962
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
HE WAS CARRYING THREE WEAPONS

963
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000

AR 15 ASSAULT WEAPONS.

WAS PARKED OUTSIDE OF THE

980
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
SCHOOL.
>> PERHAPS THE MOST TERRIFYING

981
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
PART OF THE STORY IS THE FACT

982
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
THAT THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF

983
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000

SHOOTING AS HORRIBLE AS IT WAS

989
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000

996
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
FOR SCHOOL OFFICIALS, BECAUSE

00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
SCHOOL CAMPUSES ARE NOT DESIGNED

998
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000

00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
WILL USE WHATEVER MEANS

1003
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
NECESSARY.
THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON

1004
