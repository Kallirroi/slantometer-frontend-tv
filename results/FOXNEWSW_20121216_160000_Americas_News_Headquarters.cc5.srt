CLOSENESS IN PRAYER.

198

FATHER, HOW DO WE MAKE SENSE OF

199
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
THIS, WITH OUR FAITH, TURNING TO

200
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
GOD?
IT'S SO HORRIFIC AND

201
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
INCOMPREHENSIBLE.
WHAT DO WE DO?

202
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
>> CLOSENESS, AS BOTH MENTIONED

203
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
IN PRAYER AND ALSO IN

204

IF I WERE IN NEWTOWN,

206
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000

207
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
NOT BE GIVING AN EXPLANATION.

208
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I WOULD GIVE A HUG.

209
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
THE ONE THING THAT THE FAMILIES

210
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
TRAGIC SITUATIONS ALWAYS SAY,

211
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
WHAT GOT ME THROUGH IT WAS MY

212
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
FAITH AND MY FAMILY, THOSE WHO

213
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
WERE CLOSE TO ME AND HUGGED ME,

214
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
EVEN WHEN THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

215
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
TO SAY.

216
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000

PARISHIONERS AND TO THE VIEWERS

221

SO EMOTIONAL, SOME COMFORT AND

224

ASSURANCE OF FAITH -- NO MATTER

WHAT YOUR FAITH IS?

TOPICS OF HOW CAN AN ALL-LOVING,

229
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
ALL-POWERFUL GOD LET THIS HAPPEN

230
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
AND I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT

231
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
FREE WILL AND ABUSE OF FREE WILL

232
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
AND TO DISCOURAGE JUDGMENT.

233
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
NO SINGLE FACTOR CAN ATTRIBUTE

234
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
SUCH A TERRIBLE ACT.

235
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
WE SEE THE MENTAL ILLNESS AND

236
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
THE DISTURBANCE WITHIN THE

237
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
FAMILY UNIT, OF THE DIVORCE AND

238
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
THE NOT TALKING TO THE FAMILY,

239
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
ALL OF THIS TAKES -- COMES INTO

240
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
PLAY.
THERE IS A FACTOR OF EVIL.

241
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
SUPERNATURAL FORCES AND ALLOWING

242
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
OURSELVES, OUR SOULS TO GO DARK.

243
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I AM GOING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

244
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
TO DOUBLE DOWN ON LOVE.

245
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
WHEN WE SEE THIS TRAGEDY, WE SAY

246
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
THAT IS CONTRARY TO HUMAN

247
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
NATURE, CONTRARY TO HUMAN

248
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
REASON.

249
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
BUT WE USE OUR FREE WILL AS ONE

250
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
OF PARENTS SAID SO BEAUTIFULLY

251
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
YESTERDAY, I RECOGNIZE THAT I AM

252
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
NOT ANGRY AT THIS YOUNG MAN

253
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
BECAUSE HE CHOSE TO USE HIS FREE

254
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
WILL TERRIBLY.

255
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
BUT I CAN USE IT FOR THE GOOD.

256
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THAT'S WHAT I AM GOING TO DO.

257
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

258
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
WE CAN DOUBLE DOWN ON LOVE.

259
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ONE MORE

260
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
CHALLENGE.

261
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000

262
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000

263

264

ABOUT THOSE WHO CANNOT CELEBRATE

IN THE SAME WAY, MAKE A DECISION

266
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
WITHIN YOUR FAMILY TO CHANGE A

267
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
TRADITION, TO GET DOWN BEFORE

268
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
OPENING THE GIFTS AND IN YOUR

269
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
OWN WAY, HOWEVER YOU CAN, TO SAY

270
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000

271
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
FOR LIFE, THANK GOD NEAR FAMILY,

THANK GOD FOR RELATIONSHIPS AND

273
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
TO DECIDE THAT YOU WILL DOUBLE

274
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
DOWN ON LOVE.

275
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ALL CAN

276
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000

OF ONE OF THE CHILDREN WHO WAS

283
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
KILLED.
OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO ALL THE

284
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
VICTIMS.
OPENING PRESENTS, IT'S REALLY

285
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
ABOUT THE LOVE OF FAMILY AND IT

286
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000

WE LIVE IN A TIME, WHEN THE

294
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
SOCIAL MEDIA CAN SEPARATE US AND

295
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
WE FEEL DISTANCE.

296
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000

297
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
HILLARY CLINTON.

372
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
LET'S BRING IN AARON DAVID

373
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
MILLER, FORMER ADVISER TO SIX

374
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
SECRETARIES OF STATE AND THE

375
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE WOODROW

376
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
WILSON CENTER.
A PRIVILEGE TO HAVE YOU HERE.

377
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
THANKS FOR JOIN JOINING US.

378
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
>> PLEASURE, JAMIE.

379
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
>> JAMIE: THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE

380
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
LIST OF EXPERIENCE.
AS YOU LOOK AT THE CHOICE OF

381
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
JOHN KERRY, IF HE IS IN FACT,

382
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
SELECTED, WOULD HE BRING TO OUR

383
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
NATION'S SAFETY AND SECURITY AND

384
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER

385
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
NATIONS?
>> I MEAN, LOOK, THE KERRY

386
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
APPOINTMENT IS SAFE.

387
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
IT'S CENTRIST.

388
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
HE'S GOING TO BE LOYAL TO THE

389
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
PRESIDENT AND HE'S CONFIRMABLE.

390
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
BEYOND THAT, I THINK THE CENTRAL

391
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
QUESTION IS, HOW MUCH INFLUENCE

392
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
WILL HE REALLY HAVE?

393
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
BARACK OBAMA IS THE MOST

394
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
WITHHOLDING FOREIGN POLICY

395
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
PRESIDENT SINCE RICHARD NIXON,

396
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
ALL POWER FLOWS IN AND OUT OF

397
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
THE WHITE HOUSE ON MOST OF THE

398
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
CONS QUENTIAL ISSUES WITH WAR

399
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
AND PEACE WITH REGARD TO THE

400
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
NATION.
SO I THINK THE QUESTION IS, IF

401
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
BARACK OBAMA DECIDES TO

402
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
DELEGATE, RATHER THAN DOMINATE,

403
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
WHICH HE DID NOT DO TO HIS QUITE

404
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
TALENTED CURRENT SECRETARY OF

405
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
STATE, THEN I THINK THE

406
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
APPOINTMENT OF JOHN KERRY WILL

407
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
BE CONS QUENTIAL, TELL MATTER F.

408
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
HE DOESN'T, THEN JOHN KERRY WILL

409
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
IMPLEMENT THE PRESIDENT'S

410
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
FOREIGN POLICY.

411
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
THAT'S WHAT THE SECRETARY OF

412
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
STATE IS CHARGED TO DO.

413
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
BUT USUALLY, WHEN WE HAVE HAD

414
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
TRULY CONS QUENTIAL SUCCESSES OF

415
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
STATE, HENRY KISSINGER, GEORGE

416
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
SCHULZ, JAMES BAKER, THE

417
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
SECRETARY HAD A LOT OF LEEWAY TO

418
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
CREATE AND SHAPE THE POLICY,

419
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
RATHER THAN EXECUTE IT.
THAT'S WAWE DON'T KNOW RIGHT

420
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
NOW.
WILL KERRY BE ALLOWED TO DO

421
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
THAT?
OR WILL HE ESSENTIALLY BE AN

422
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
EXECUTOR OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT

423
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
WANTS.

424
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
>> JAMIE:

425
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
>> JAMIE: WHAT TYPE OF

426
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
FOUNDATION DID HILLARY CLINTON,

427
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
AS SECRETARY OF STATE LAY FOR

428
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
THE NEXT SECRETARY?

429
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
>> IT'S REALLY FASCINATING.

430
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
SHE WAS A SECRETARY OF STATE WHO

431
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
CAME TO THE OFFICE WITH MORE

432
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
STAR POWER AND QUALITY THAN ANY

433
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
OF OUR PREVIOUS SUCCESSES WITH

434
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF COLIN

435
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
POWELL.
I MEAN, SHE HAD 8 YEARS IN THE

436
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
WHITE HOUSE.

437
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
SHE WAS ALMOST THE PRESIDENT --

438
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
AT LEAST SHE WAS ALMOST THE

439
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR

440
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
PRESIDENT.
SO SHE HAD TREMENDOUS APPEAL.

441
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I THINK BY AND LARGE, SHE

442
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
UNDERSTOOD THAT BARACK OBAMA IS

443
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
A WITHHOLDING PRESIDENT AND SHE

444
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
IDENTIFIED IN ISSUES -- THEY

445
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
WEREN'T WHAT I WOULD CALL FIRST

446
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
TIER ISSUES.

447
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
BUT SHE IDENTIFIED ISSUES-- THE

448
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
ENVIRONMENT, GENDER ISSUES,

449
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
IMPROVING -- WHICH I THINK WAS A

450
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
VERY IMPORTANT ROLE FOR HER TO

451
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
PLAY -- IMPROVING AMERICA'S

452
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
IMAGE AND CREDIBILITY ABROAD

453
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
THROUGH HER RELENTLESS TRAVEL

454
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
AND THE FACT THAT SHE WAS VERY

455
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
GOOD AT WHAT SHE DOES.

456
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
KERRY'S A LOT STIFFER AND MORE

457
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
AWKWARD, PUBLICLY.

458
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
HE MAY LOSE A LITTLE OF THAT.

459
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
BUT DIPLOMACY IS A GET-ALONG

460
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
BUSINESS.

461
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
LET'S BE CLEAR.
THAT'S ITS STRENGTH AND ITS

462
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
WEAKNESS, AT THE SAME TIME.

463
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
KERRY IS GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN

464
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
HOW TO BE MUCH MORE RELAXED AND

465
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE.

466
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
>> JAMIE: AARON, YOU MENTION,

467
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
IT'S A GET-ALONG BUSINESS.

468
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
ON THE BIGGEST SCALE WE HAVE

469
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
SEEN IN I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG --

470
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
YOU COULD TELL ME -- THERE ARE

471
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
SO MANY COUNTRIES IN TURMOIL, SO

472
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
MUCH HATE FOR AMERICA.

473
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
HOW CHALLENGING A JOB IS IT FOR

474
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
JOHN KERRY OR WHATEVER IS THE

475
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE?

476
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
DO YOU SEE THEM NEGOTIATING WITH

477
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
COUNTRIES LIKE IRAN, WHERE WE

478
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
HAVEN'T SEEN THAT HAPPEN?

479
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
>> OTHER THAN BEING PRESIDENT,

480
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
BEING SECRETARY OF STATE IS THE
BEST JOB, I THINK, IN TERMS OF

481
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
SERVING THE REPUBLIC.

482
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
BUT AT THIS MOMENT IN OUR

483
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
HISTORY, IT'S GOT TO BE ONE OF

484
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
THE MOST CHALLENGING.

485
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
WE ARE FACING IN THE

486
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
MIDDLE-EAST, THE AREA I KNOW

487
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
BEST, WE ARE FACING ISSUES THAT

488
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
ARE DIVIDED BETWEEN MIGRAINE

489
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
HEADACHES ON ONE HAND OR ROOT

490
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
CANAL OPERATIONS ON THE OTHER.

491
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
IRAN, THE ARAB/ISRAELI CONFLICT,

492
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
THE ARAB SPRING THAT LOOKS TO ME

493
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
MORE LIKE AN ARAB WINTER IN

494
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
GETTING COLDER ALL THE TIME.

495
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
THESE ARE ISSUES THAT IMPINGE ON

496
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
AMERICA'S NATIONAL SECURITY.

497
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
BUT I AM AFRAID THAT OUR

498
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
INTERESTS ARE LARGE, BUT OUR

499
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
CAPACITY, OUR INFLUENCE ON THE

500
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
INTERESTS ARE SMALL.

501
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
SO I THINK THE CRITICAL ISSUE

502
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
WILL BE WHAT TO DO ABOUT IRAN'S

503
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.

504
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
THAT MAY DOMINATE 2013.

505
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT WILL

506
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
GO TO FAIRLY EXTREME LENGTHS TO

507
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
AVOID A MILITARY STRIKE AGAINST

508
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
OOH RAN.

509
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
SO AT LEAST FOR 2013, THAT'S

510
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
GOING TO PUT JOHN KERRY IN THE

511
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
POSITION OF TESTING IN A MORE

512
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
SERIOUS WAY, WHETHER THE MULLAHS

513
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
IN TEHRAN ARE INTERESTED AT ALL

514
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
IN SOME SORT OF NEGOTIATION.

515
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
MANAGING RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA

516
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
AND CHINA WILL BE CERTAINLY AT

517
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
THE TOP OF THE LIST.

518
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
AND OF COURSE, THE MOST

519
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
IMPORTANT ISSUE OF ALL, HOW TO

520
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
KEEP AMERICA SAFE, WHICH IS THE

521
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE OF ANY

522
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
NATION'S FOREIGN POLICY.

523
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
IF YOU CAN'T PROTECT YOUR

524
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
HOMELAND, FRANKLY, YOU DON'T

525
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
NEED A FOREIGN POLICY.

526
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
THAT'S AT THE TOP OF THE LIST.

527
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN

528
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
POLITIC, NATIONAL SECURITY.

529
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
THIS IS GOING TO BE AN

530
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING JOB AT A

531
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
CRITICAL MOMENT, BOTH IN THE

532
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
NATION'S FOREIGN POLICY AND ITS

533
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
NATIONAL SECURITY.

534
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
>> JAMIE: AARON DAVID MILLER,

535
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
WHO HAS ADVISED SIX SECRETARIES

536
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
OF STATES.

537

PLEASE, WE ARE ASKING YOU, AS WE

538
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000

POSITION AND THE NATIONAL
SECURITY TEAM, COME BACK, WEIGH

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
IN, LET US KNOW HOW THEY ARE

541
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
DOING ON THAT.

542
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
>> LOVE TO, JAMIE.

543
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
TAKE CARE.
>> JAMIE: ALL THE BEST.

544
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
>> ERIC: JAMIE, WE ARE AWAITING

545
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
A NEWS CONFERENCE ON THE LATEST

546
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
ON THE SCHOOL SHOOTING IN

547
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
CONNECTICUT.

548
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
THAT'S WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

549
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
IT'S NEWTOWN AND THE PODIUM

550
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
BEING SET UP, AS THE CAMERAS AND

551
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
THE REPORTERS AND THE NEWS MEDIA

552
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
ARE GETTING READY FOR THE LAW

553
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL WHO IS WILL

554
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
GIVE US AN UPDATE.

555
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
THIS, AS THE NATION GRIEVES,

556
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
WITH COMPASSION AND PRAYERS.

557
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE

558
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
SELFLESS ACTIONS OF THE BRAVE

559
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
STUDENTS AND TEACHERS AND THE

560
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
INCREDIBLY TOUCHING STORIES OF

561
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
THE LITTLE INNOCENT LIVES LOST.

562
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Sometimes what we suffer from

563
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Is bigger than we think ...
like the flu.

564
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
With aches, fever and chills-
the flu's a really big deal.

565
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So why treat it like
it's a little cold?

566
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
There's something
that works differently

567
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
than over-the-counter
remedies.

568
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Prescription TAMIFLU attacks
the flu virus at its source.

569
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So don't wait. Call your
doctor right away.

570
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
TAMIFLU is prescription
medicine for treating the flu

571
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
in adults and children
one year and older

572
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
whose flu symptoms started
within the last two days.

573
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Before taking TAMIFLU tell your
doctor if you're pregnant,

574
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
nursing. have serious
health conditions,

575
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
or take other medicines.

576
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If you develop an allergic
reaction, a severe rash,

577
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
or signs of unusual behavior,

578
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
stop taking TAMIFLU and call
your doctor immediately.

579
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Children and adolescents in
particular may be at an

580
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
increased risk
of seizures, confusion

581
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
or abnormal behavior.

582
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The most common
side effects are

583
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
mild to moderate nausea
and vomiting.

584
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
The flu comes on fast,

585
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
so ask your
doctor about TAMIFLU.

586
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Prescription for flu.

AMONG SO MANY OTHER THINGS, IT

802
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
WAS DIFFICULT NOT TO HAVE THE

803
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
TEARS WELL UP CONSTANTLY, IS THE

804
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
TASK THAT A PARENT HAS TO DO IN

805
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
ORDER TO CONFIRM -- YES, THAT

806
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
WAS MY CHILD.

807
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
DR. MICHAEL BODDEN SAYS, YOU

808
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
KNOW, THE KIDS WERE SUPPOSED TO

809
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
IDENTIFY OUR PARENTS, NOT THE

810
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
OTHER WAY AROUND.

811
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
HOW DO YOU SURVIVE THAT?

812
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
>> THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY

813
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
TRAUMATIC.

814
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I DON'T KNOW THE PARTICULARS IN

815
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
WHICH THE FAMILIES WERE ABLE TO

816
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
IDENTIFY THEIR CHILDREN UP IN

817
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
NEWTOWN --
>> JAMIE: THEY USED PHOTOGRAPHS.

818
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
THEY DID IT VERY CONSIDERATELY.

819
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
>> THAT SEEMS TO BE THE RIGHT

820
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
WAY.

821
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I WISH THE PARENTS DIDN'T HAVE

822
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
TO WAIT SO LONG.

823
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
THAT HAD TO BE I FELT GRUELING,

824
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
IT WONDER IF YOUR CHILD WAS

825
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
GOING TO COME OUT OF THAT ROOM.

826
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
>> JAMIE: I CAN'T IMAGINE THE

827
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
THOUGHTS IN A TIME LIKE THIS.

828
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
WHAT IS IT THAT PEOPLE DID FOR

829
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
YOU AND FIRST OF ALL, LET ME

830
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
SAY, EVERYTHING THAT WE LEARNED

831
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
ABOUT CHRISTINA WAS AMAZING.

832
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
IN HER SHORT LIFE, SHE MADE SUCH

833
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
A DIFFERENCE FOR SO MANY PEOPLE,

834
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
NOT ONLY IN YOUR FAMILY, BUT

835
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
OTHERS.

836
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
SHE WENT THAT DITO MEET THE

837
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
CONGRESSWOMAN BECAUSE SHE WANTED

838
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
TO DO THINGS FOR THIS COUNTRY,

839
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
EVEN AT HER YOUNG AGE, SHE WAS

840
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
RUNNING FOR STUDENT GOVERNMENT

841
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
AND IT WAS AN IMPORTANT EVENT

842
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
FOR HER TO ATTEND.

843
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
WHAT IS IT THAT PEOPLE DID FOR

844
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
YOU IN YOUR COMMUNITY THAT WE

845
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
CAN DO IN NEWTOWN AND EVEN HERE

846
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
IN NEW YORK AND AROUND THE

847
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
NATION FOR THESE FAMILIES THAT

848
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
YOU FOUND HELPFUL?

849
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
>> THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

850
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I THINK SOMETHING THAT WE MAY

851
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
HAVE TO OFFER.

852
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
AGAIN, I AM SURE THERE IS -- ON

853
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, PEOPLE HAVE

854
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
DIFFERENT NEEDS.

855
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
BUT TO TELL THE FAMILIES AND

856
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
THEIR TOWN TO EMBRACE -- EMBRACE

857
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
PEOPLE SURROUNDING THEM.

858
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
YOU KNOW, AT FIRST, WE WERE

859
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
GOING TO -- ON THE WAY HOME FROM

860
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
THE HOSPITAL, AFTER WE HAD

861
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
LEARNED CHRISTINA... WE JUST

862
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
WANTED TO CRAWL INSIDE OUR HOUSE

863
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
AND STAY THERE ALONE FOREVER.

864
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
YOU KNOW?
THAT WAS THE -- IMMEDIATE

865
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
FEELING AND OUR INSTINCTS.

866
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
BUT THANK GOD OUR FRIENDS, OUR

867
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
FAMILY, OUR COMMUNITY, EVEN OUR

868
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
CHURCH -- THEY DIDN'T LISTEN TO

869
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
US.

870
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
WE DIDN'T REALIZE THE SCOPE OF

871
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
EVERYTHING AT THAT POINT, THE

872
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
MEDIA ATTENTION, YOU KNOW, WHAT

873
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

874
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
BUT WE ALLOWED OTHERS TO COME IN

875
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
AND HELP US.

876
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
USUALLY, WE ARE VERY

877
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
INDEPENDENT.

878
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
WE CAN DO THIS ON OUR OWN.

879
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
BUT IT WAS SO OVERWHELMING, WE

880
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
ALLOWED OTHERS TO COME IN AND

881
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
HELP US WHERE WE NORMALLY WOULD

882
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
NOT.
THAT WAS -- THAT WAS THE BEST

883
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
MEDICINE, TO ALLOW, YOU KNOW,

884
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
YOUR CHURCH MEMBERS, YOUR FAMILY

885
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
AND FRIENDS THAT ARE CLOSE TO

886
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000

00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
SUNDAY MORNING.

922
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

923
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
>> ERIC: WHEN IT COMES TO NORTH

924
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
KOREA, A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK

925
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
THEY ARE NUTS.

926
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR

927
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
NEIGHBORS OR THE INTERNATIONAL

928
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
COMMUNITY.
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE

929
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
SECURITY COUNCIL.
THEY ARE HOSTILE, BELLIGGERRANT

930
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
AND A DANGER.

931
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
CHINA IS THEIR PROTECTOR.

932
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
WHAT CAN WE DO?

933
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE

934
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
DONE IN THE PAST WHICH WAS

935
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL WAS BASICALLY

936
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
TO BLACK LIST THE BANKS THAT

937
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
WERE DOING BUSINESS WITH NORTH

938
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
KOREA.
REMEMBER, THEY HAVE TO GET HARD

939
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
CURRENCY.

940
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
THEY DON'T PRODUCE ANYTHING.

941
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
SO WHEN WE FOUND THEY WERE

942
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
COUNTERFEITING HUNDRED-DOLLAR

943
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
BILLS, WE BEGAN A PROCESS OF

944
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
FREEZING THOSE ACCOUNT, NOT

945
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
ALLOWING THE BANKS TO DO

946
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
BUSINESS WITH THE WEST.

947
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
OF COURSE, THE BANKS SAID ALL

948
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
RIGHT N. THAT CASE, WE WILL NOT

949
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
RUN MONEY THROUGH THIS ACCOUNT

950
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
FOR NORTH KOREA.

951
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
WE WILL FREEZE IT.

952
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
AS A RESULT, KIM JUNG IL WAS

953
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
WANT ABLE TO RUP HIS PROGRAM.

954
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
BUT WE SHOULD RE-DEPLOY THE

955
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
SANCTIONS?

956
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
>> WHO LOOKED AT THAT -- WHY DID

957
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
THEY LIFT IT?

958
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
IT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO GIVE THEM

959
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
CARROT, HOPING IT WILL --

960
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
>> EXACTLY.

961
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
RIGHT.

962
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
FOR THE LAST 18 YEARS, AS YOU

963
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
KNOW, THERE HAS BEEN AN EFFORT

964
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
OFF AND ON TO GIVE CARROTS.

965
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
WE HAVE TRANSFERRED BILLIONS IN

966
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
FOOD AID.

967
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
SOUTH KOREA HAS TRANSFERRED A

968
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
LET OF AID.
SO AS A CONSEQUENCE, ACCORDING

969
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
TO DEFECTORS, WHAT WE HAVE

970
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
REALLY DONE IS TO HELP FUND

971
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM THROUGH

972
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
THIS PROCESS.

973
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
THOSE DEFECTORS, SENIOR

974
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
DEFECTORS ARE TELLING US, WE

975
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
SHOULD SHUT DOWN THE EFFORT TO

976
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
TRANSFER AND INSTEAD FOCUS ON

977
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
WHAT WE CAN DO TO INTERDICT THE

978
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
SHIPS THAT LEAVE NORTH KOREA

979
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
WITH WEAPONS WHICH OCCASIONALLY,

980
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
WE DO DO, AS YOU KNOW.

981
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
BUT WE SHOULD STEP THAT UP.

982
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
PUT THE SANCTIONS BACK ON THE

983
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
BANK ACCOUNTS AND START

984
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
BROADCASTING WITH A TOUGHER

985
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
MESSAGE INTO NORTH KOREA TO

986
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
REACH THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE AS

987
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
WE DID IN THE EAST BLOC YOU?

988
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
>> ARE SAYING THE OBAMA

989
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
ADMINISTRATION LIFTED THIS AND

990
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
THE RESULT IS WE GET ANOTHER

991
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
ROCKET?
>> IT WAS LIFTED ACTUALLY, UNDER

992
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION--

993
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
>>> OKAY.

994
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
>> WE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS -- THAT

995
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
WAS A BLUNDER.

996
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
WE HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM OFF AND

997
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
ON, AS I SAY, THROUGH THE LAST

998
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
THREE ADMINISTRATIONS.

999
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
SO THE TIME HAS REALLY COME AT

1000
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
THIS POINT FOR A DIFFERENT

1001
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
APPROACH.
THIS APPROACH HASN'T WORKED--

1002
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
>>> I'M SORRY.

1003
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOU.

1004
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
WHETHER IT'S THE BUSH

1005
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
ADMINISTRATION, THE OBAMA

1006
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
ADMINISTRATION, THE CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION HAD THAT DEAL THE

1007
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
FOOD AND FUEL DEAL.

1008
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
THAT DIDN'T DETER THEM.

1009
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
SO BOTTOM LINE --

1010
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
>> NOT ONLY--

1011
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
>>> GO AHEAD.

1012
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
>>  IT ACTUALLY EMPOWERED THEM

1013
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
BECAUSE DURING THAT TIME, THEY

1014
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
WERE SELLING THE ABILITY TO

1015
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
SYRIA TO MAKE A NUCLEAR DEVICE

1016
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
IN 2007.

1017
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
THAT WAS TAKEN OUT BY THE

1018
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
ISRAELI AIR FORCE THAT TOOK OUT

1019
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
THAT FACILITY.

1020
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
BUT THE NORTH KOREAN SCIENTISTS

1021
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
WERE BUILDING A NUCLEAR BOMB FOR

1022
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
THE SYRIANS AT THIS TIME.

1023
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
THIS LAUNCH WAS AN ADVERTISING

1024
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
PLOY HERE TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN

1025
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
DELIVER A THREE-STAGE ICBM,

1026
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
WHICH POTENTIALLY COULD HIT THE

1027
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
UNITED STATES.

1028
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO -- TO ACT

1029
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
NOW.
THERE ARE REPORTS IN THE SOUTH

1030
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
KOREAN MEDIA THAT IRANIAN

1031
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
SCIENTISTS WERE ON HAND FOR THIS

1032
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
LAUNCH.
SO CLEARLY, SINCE THEY'RE

1033
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000

SCHEDULED THIS AFTERNOON.

1111
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS ON

00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000

WITH THE SCHOOL.

1119
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
THE SCHOOL CRIME SCENE, THE

1120
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
BUILDING ITSELF IS STILL BEING

1121
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
WORKED ON.

1122
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
REMEMBER, I TOLD YOU WE HAD A

SEARCHED EACH AND EVERY ONE EVER

00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000

1128
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
WE ARE BEGINNING TO RELEASE

1129
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
THOSE BACK TO THEIR OWNERS.

1130
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
SO SLOWLY, BUT SURELY, WE ARE

1131
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
BEGINNING TO COMPLETE THE

1132
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
EXTERIOR PART OF THE CRIME

1133
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
SCENE.
THE GOVERNOR AND LIEUTENANT

GOVERNOR ARE ON SITE.

1135
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
THEY HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED

1136
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
TODAY.
ONE THING THAT IS BECOMING

1137
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
SOMEWHAT OF A CONCERN AND THAT

1138
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
IS MISINFORMATION IS BEING

1139
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA SITES.

1140
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
THERE HAS BEEN MISINFORMATION

1141
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
COMING FROM PEOPLE POSING AS THE

1142
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
SHOOTENER THIS CASE, POSING --

1143
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
USING OTHER I.D.s, MIMICKING

1144
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
THIS CRIME AND CRIME SCENE AND

1145
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT TOOK

1146
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
THERE HAS BEEN SOME THINGS AND

1148
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
SOMEWHAT OF A THREATENING

1149
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
MANNER.

1150
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE

1151
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
HAVE DISCUSSED WITH FEDERAL

1152
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
AUTHORITIES THAT THESE -- THESE

1153
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
ISSUES ARE CRIMES.

1154
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
THEY WILL BE INVESTIGATED.

1155
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
STATEWIDE AND FEDERALLY AND

1156
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
PROSECUTION WILL TAKE PLACE WHEN

1157
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
PEOPLE PERPETRATING THIS

1158
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
INFORMATION ARE IDENTIFIED.

1159
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
AGAIN, ALL INFORMATION RELATIVE

1160
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
TO THIS CASE IS COMING FROM

1161
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
THESE MICROPHONES AND ANY

1162
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
INFORMATION COMING FROM OTHER

1163
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
SOURCES CANNOT BE CONFIRMED AND

1164
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
IN MANY CASES HAS BEEN FOUND IS

1165
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
INACCURATE.
SO I SIMPLY, THAT'S THE NEWEST

1166
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
TWIST TODAY THAT WE WANT TO MAKE

1167
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
SURE IS PERFECTLY CLEAR, SOCIAL

1168
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
MEDIA WEB SITES WITH INFORMATION

1169
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
RELATIVE TO THIS CASE ARE NOT

1170
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000

1174
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
IN THIS CASE.

1175
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
SO ANY OF THAT INFORMATION AND

1176
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
PEOPLE THAT ARE PUTTING THAT

1177
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
INFORMATION UP THERE, IN ANY

1178
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
MANNER, ALL RIGHT?

1179
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
THAT CAN BE CONSTRUED AS A

1180
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
VIOLATION OF STATE OR FEDERAL

1181
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
LAW, WILL BE PROSECUTED, WILL BE

1182
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED.

1183
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
QUESTIONS.
I CAN TAKE A FEW.

1184
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
AGAIN, UNDERSTANDING THAT WE

1185
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
STILL ARE ACTIVE IN THIS CASE,

1186
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
OKAY.

1187
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
>> Reporter: A VERY SPECIFIC

1188
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
TIMELINE OF HOW THE EVENTS

1189
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
HAPPENED.
I AM WONDERING IF YOU CAN

1190
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
CONFIRM THAT TIMELINE THAT IS

1191
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
BEING REPORTED IN GREAT DETAIL

1192
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000

1193
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
>> VERY GOOD QUESTION.

1194
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
>> Reporter: THANK YOU.

1195
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000

THIS CASE, TO EVERY MEMBER OF

1197
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
THE MEDIA.

1198
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I CANNOT RESTATE OR STATE

1199
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
HEAVILY ENOUGH, I HAVE NOT AND

1200
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
WILL NOT PUT OUT A TIMELINE IN

1201
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
THIS CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AS

1202
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
IT IS UNDERWAY.

1203
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
IT IS INAPPROPRIATE.

1204
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
WE WILL NOT DO THAT.

1205
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
ANY SOURCES THAT ARE PUTTING OUT

1206
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
ANY KIND OF INFORMATION LIKE

1207
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
THAT DOES NOT COME FROM THE

1208
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
OFFICIAL INVESTIGATING AGENCY,

1209
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
WHICH IS THE CONNECTICUT STATE

1210
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
POLICE, ASSISTED BY THE NEWTOWN

1211
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

1212
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
WE WILL NOT PUT THAT OUT AS THE

1213
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING.

1214
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I HAVE NOT READ IT.

1215
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

1216
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
BUT WE HAVE NOT PUT OUT ANY

1217
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
TIMELINE INFORMATION.

1218
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
WE WOULD NOT DO THAT.

1219
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
>> Reporter: I WOULD LIKE TO

1220
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
FOLLOW UP ON THAT, YOU HAVE SAID

1221
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
THERE WERE TWO PLACES INSIDE THE

1222
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
SCHOOL.
CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT THE

1223
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
PRINCIPAL AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST

1224
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
WERE SHOT NEAR THE FRONT DOOR

1225
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
AND THE CHILDREN AND THE OTHER

1226
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
WORKERS WERE IN THE CLASSROOMS?

1227
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
>> WHAT I STATED, RELATIVE TO

1228
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
THE INTERIOR OF THE CRIME SCENE

1229
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
THAT WAS THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE

1230
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
IN A SINGULAR SECTION OF THE

1231
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
SCHOOL THAT INVOLVED TWO

1232
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
CLASSROOMS AND A HALLWAY.

1233
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
THAT'S AS MUCH AS WE SAID ABOUT

1234
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
THAT.
WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT DESCRIBE

1235
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
THE LOCATION OF THE DECEASED IN

1236
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
THIS INVESTIGATION.

1237
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
WE WON'T DO THAT.

1238
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
YES, SIR?

1239
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
SIR?

1240
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
>> Reporter: WILL YOU CONFIRM,

1241
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
YOU SAID YOU ARE INVESTIGATING

1242
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
THE FIREARMS?

1243
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
>> YES, SIR.
>> Reporter: THE SHOOTER WAS

1244
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
TAKEN BY HIS FAMILY MEMBER TO A

1245
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
SHOOTING RANGE AND --

1246
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
[INAUDIBLE]?
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT, QUITE

1247
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
FRANKLY.
AND THAT'S WHAT I AM TRYING TO

1248
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT

1249
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
WE CAN'T TAKE SEGMENTS OF AN

1250
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSS IT

1251
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
PUBLICLY BECAUSE SOMETHING TAKEN

1252
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
OUT OF CONTEXT COULD BE

1253
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
MISINTERPRETED.
IT COULD BE MISINTERPRETED AND

1254
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
NOT FACTUAL, ONCE IT'S

1255
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
MISINTERPRETED.

1256
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
THEREFORE, NUMBER 1, I DON'T

1257
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT, THAT

1258
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
PARTICULAR STATEMENT THAT YOU

1259
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
JUST MADE.

1260
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
NUMBER 2, EVEN IF I DID, I WOULD

1261
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
SAY, LET US PUT IT INTO THE

1262
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
CONTEXT OF THE INVESTIGATION SO

1263
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
WE CAN MANAGE IT AND YOU CAN GET

1264
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
THE WHOLE, COMPLETE PICTURE OF

1265
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
WAIS GOING ON.

1266
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
>> Reporter: DO YOU KNOW

1267
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
ANYTHING ABOUT THE FIREARMS?

1268
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
>> JUST THE FOUR FIREARM, WE ARE

1269
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL

1270
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
PARTNERS AND WE ARE ANALYZING,

1271
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
EXAMINING, WE WILL TRACE THEM

1272
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
BACK TO THEIR ORIGIN.

1273
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
WE WILL TRACE EVERY STEP OF THE

1274
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
WAY AND EVERY TIME THAT WE CAN,

1275
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
WHERE THEY WERE USED, HOW THEY

1276
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
WERE USED AND HOW THEY WERE

1277
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
EXAMINED FORENSICALLY.

1278
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
A GREAT DEAL OF WORK MUST BE

1279
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
DONE ON THE WEAPONS.

1280
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
>> Reporter: ANY OTHER

1281
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
WEAPONS?

1282
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
>> I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

1283
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I DO NOT KNOW.

1284
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
OUR DETECTIVES WILL IN FACT BE

1285
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000

STATED WHAT EVIDENCE WE HAVE AND

HAVE NOT COLLECTED.

1309
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I WANT TO MAKE THAT PERFECTLY

IT'S A HUGE CASE.
WE'RE USING EVERY SINGLE

WE JUST GOT THAT INFORMATION AS

THAT PROCESS.

WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE PARENTS

EXAMINED ON A LOCAL AND

1381

STATEWIDE BASIS.

1382
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
THERE ARE MANY PLANS FOR

1383
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
EMERGENCY PURPOSES IN ALL THE

1384
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000

ALL OF THEM ARE BEING

1386
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
RE-EXAMINED AND THE PARENTS

1387
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
SHOULD IN FACT BE CONFIDENT THAT

MAKE SURE THAT THE SCHOOLS IN

1394
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
CONNECTICUT ARE SAFE.

1395
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
WHAT I WOULD LIKE THE LIEUTENANT

1396
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
TO DO IS TO TALK ABOUT THE

1397
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
SCHOOLS HERE IN NEWTOWN.

1398
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
ONE SECOND.

1399

WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

SCHOOLS HERE.

1402
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
OBVIOUSLY, WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE

1403
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
TO THE FAMILIES IN THIS

1404
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
SITUATION.

00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD VERY

1406
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
SLOWLY AND RESPECTFULLY.

1407
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
THEY DO HAVE SOME TENTATIVE

1408
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
PLANS, AS FAR AS MOVING FORWARD

1409
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
WITH SCHOOL.
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WILL BE

1410
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
PUTTING THOSE OUT IN THE NEAR

1411
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
FUTURE.

1412
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
>> Reporter: DO YOU THINK THE

CHILDREN WILL EVER RETURN TO

1414

TO SAY.

1417
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
BUT I WOULD FIND IT VERY

1418
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO THAT.

1419
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
BUT CERTAINLY, THAT'S ONE OF THE

1420
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
THINGS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO

1421
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000

IT'S TENTATIVE RIGHT NOW.

1428
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
BUT WE ARE TRYING TO BE AS

1429
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
RESPECTFUL AS WE CAN.

1430
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
WE NEED TO KEEP THE KIDS

1431
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
TOGETHER.

1432
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000

OTHER.

1434
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000

>> Reporter: WITHOUT REVEALING

1436

A SPECIFIC TIME LINE, YOU CAN

1437

SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE GENERAL

1438

SENSE OF THE SCHOOL?

1439
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
>> THE MOST GENERAL I CAN BE IS

1440
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
IT HAS TO BE VERY GENERAL, WAS

1441
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
THAT THE SCHOOL WAS FORCEFULLY

1442
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
ENTERED THE FACILITY ITSELF.

1443
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
OKAY, ENCOUNTERED...

1444
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
JUST ENCOUNTERED THE STUDENTS

1445

AND THE TRAGEDY OCCURRED.

1446
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000

ARE BROKEN, AS WE ALL WELL KNOW.

1452
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
WE HAVE TO BE SENSITIVE.

THAT WILL BE IN THE FINAL

1469
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
SUMMARY.

1470
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
EVERYONE KEEPS ASKING THAT

1471
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
QUESTION.

1472
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU THAT FOR US

1473
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
TO BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU A SUMMARY

1474
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
OF THE MOTIVE, WE HAVE TO

1475
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000

1476
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
WE HAVE TO HAVE THE WHOLE

1477
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
PICTURE BEFORE WE CAN SAY AND

1478
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000

00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000

1480
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
QUICKLY.
>> Reporter: ANY WRITINGS, ANY

1481
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
NOTES BEHIND?

00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
WE DON'T DO THAT.

1483
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
IT'S SIMPLY STATED, WE HAVE A

1484
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
GREAT DEAL OF EVIDENCE THAT

1485
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000

1486
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
THAT'S ALL I CAN SEESAY.
