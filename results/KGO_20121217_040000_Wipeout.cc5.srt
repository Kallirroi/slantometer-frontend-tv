'COURSE. I CAN'T GET

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I THINK SO.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
HO, HO, HO, HO!

WITHOUT SANTA.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
HE'LL BE ACTING
AS OUR MOTIVATOR TODAY.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
DON'T YOU MEAN
"HO-HO-HO-TIVATOR"?

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
HE'LL BE USING
THAT SANTA STRENGTH

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
TO BRING WIPEOUTS TO ALL
THE GOOD LITTLE GIRLS AND BOYS.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
FROM THERE,
IT'S UP TO THE SNOWFALL.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
THAT'S A BIG FLAKE,

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
WHICH IS WHAT
MY GUIDANCE COUNSELOR CALLED ME

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
WHEN HE RECOMMENDED
TRADE SCHOOL.

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
AND FINALLY,
SANTA'S WORKSHOP.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
GUARDED BY
VICIOUS ATTACK ELVES,

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
HOPPED UP
ON BALLSY'S EGGNOG.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I GOTTA GET
THAT SECRET RECIPE.
MM.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
OF OUR 24 HOLIDAY HOPEFULS,
ONLY 12 WILL MOVE ON

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
FOR A CHANCE AT PUTTING 50 GRAND
UNDER THE TREE, JOHN.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'M AS EXCITED AS...
ME ON CHRISTMAS MORNING.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
WELL, HANG ON
TO YOUR SWEATER, THEN,

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
BECAUSE I HAVE
ONE MORE PRESENT FOR YOU.

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
OOH, OOH, OOH!

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
UH, A KNIT CAP, SKINNY JEANS,
AND A PASHMINA?

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
NO.

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
IT IS THE GIFT OF
OUR NEW COHOST, VANESSA LACHEY.

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
SANTA BROUGHT US A LADY?

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
THAT'S BEEN ON MY LIST
SINCE '87.

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
HEY, THANKS, GUYS, SO MUCH.

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I JUST WANT TO SAY
I'M A HUGE FAN OF BOTH OF YOU.

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
ANDERSON,
I LOVE YOUR WORK ON ESPN,

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
AND, HENSON, YOUR DAD
INVENTED THE MUPPETS, RIGHT?

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
UH, NO.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
OH, WELL, UH... YOU KNOW WHAT?

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'M SURE YOU'VE GOT
OTHER COOL STUFF GOING ON.

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
IT'S--IT'S COOL.

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
YEAH, I'M--I'M TAKING A HIP-HOP
DANCE CLASS ON SATURDAYS...

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
THAT'S GOOD.
IF YOU WANT TO COME DOWN,
CHECK IT OUT.

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE ANOTHER TIME.
OKAY.

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW
IT'S TIME TO KICK OFF

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
OUR "DECK THE BALLS"
CHRISTMAS SPECIAL.

61
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
HERE'S OUR FIRST CONTESTANT,
JESSICA KERR.

62
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
AW, A CHRISTMAS PENGUIN.

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
AAH!

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
WHOA. I THINK SHE GOT
INTO MR. PENGUIN'S POPPERS.

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
WHOO!
YEAH, JESSICA'S OBSESSED
WITH PENGUINS.

66
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
VANESSA?

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
AAH!
OH, MY GOSH.

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
(John H.) OKAY, I BELIEVE IT.
SHE'S GOT THE OUTFIT, THE DANCE.

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
PENGUINS SCREAMED.

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
AAH!

71
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
(John A.) MAYBE SHE WAS
RAISED BY PTERODACTYLS.

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
(air horn blows)
JESSICA THE PENGUIN

73
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
FIRST TO TEST
THE SWEET NUTCRACKER.

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
HOPE SHE LEFT HER NUTS
IN HER OTHER PENGUIN SUIT.

75
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
SHE EASES RIGHT PAST
THAT FIRST ONE.

76
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
MAYBE THESE GUYS
ARE SWEETER THAN THEY LOOK.

77
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
OHH, HO HO, NO!
OH, GOODNESS!
PENGUIN DOWN!

78
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I THINK I'M GONNA
LOVE THE NUTCRACKER.

79
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I CAN FEEL IT
RIGHT DOWN IN MY--

80
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
CAREFUL.

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
BONES! I WAS GONNA
SAY "BONES." JEEZ.

82
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
JESSICA THE PENGUIN
ON TO THE CANDY CANES.

83
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ME,
YOU CANDY CANES!

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
PENGUINS AND CANDY CANES,

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
OR AS POLAR BEARS KNOW IT,
CHRISTMAS DINNER.

86
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
OHH!
OH, HO HO!

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THAT IS "OW" CANDY.

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
OOH, HO HO!

89
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
WOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN
A CANING LIKE THAT

90
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
SINCE I JAYWALKED
IN SINGAPORE.

91
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
BIG FUN NOW FOR PENGUIN--

92
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
THE JINGLE BALLS,
FEATURING OUR HO-HO-HO-TIVATOR.

93
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
HE WAS GREAT AS TIM ALLEN,
JOHNNY.

94
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
HOLY JINGLE BALLS.

95
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
YOU SAID IT, SISTER.

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
MAYBE SHE CAN
JINGLE ALL THE WAY--

97
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
OHH!
OH! OH, HO!

98
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
OH, HO HO, PENGUINS ARE
SO CUTE AND BOUNCY.
WHOA! AAH!

99
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
SOMEBODY SHOULD MAKE
A MOVIE ABOUT THEM.

100
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
FIRST LOOK AT THE SNOWFALL NOW,
WHERE JESSICA WILL SWOOP DOWN

101
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
PAST THE SPOKES
OF OUR SPINNING SNOWFLAKE.

102
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
OHH! SNOW SHE DIDN'T!

103
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
OUR FLIGHTLESS BIRD DIDN'T STAND
A CHANCE WITH THE SNOWFALL.

104
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
SEA LIONS AREN'T LOOKING SO MEAN
AFTER ALL NOW, ARE THEY?

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
PENGUIN JESSICA
WADDLING HER WAY OVER

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
TO THE FINAL OBSTACLE
OF THE DAY, SANTA'S WORKSHOP.

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
OH, BOY. THERE ARE THE ELVES.
IS ANYBODY ELSE TERRIFIED?

108
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
OH!
OH! JUST ME?

109
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
BRACE YOURSELF, JESSICA.
OOH!
AH!

110
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
PENGUIN JESSICA BATTLING
THROUGH THE AERIAL ELF ATTACK.

111
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
OHH!
EE!

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
INTO BALLSY'S EGGNOG.

113
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
YOU EVER SEEN A PENGUIN
DUNKED IN EGGNOG?

114
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I WAS IN A FRATERNITY,
VANESSA.

115
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
OH, HO!
OH, HO. DON'T TOY
WITH THESE TOY MAKERS.

116
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
YOU DON'T GET TO BE
AN ATTACK ELF

117
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
BY BEING A NICE GUY.

118
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
COME ON, GIRL.
YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

119
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
(blows raspberry)
OH, HO!

120
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
HOPE HER MATE
WASN'T WATCHING.

121
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
DON'T WORRY. IT'S WINTER.

122
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
HE'S PROBABLY SITTING
ON A GLACIER, INCUBATING AN EGG.

123
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
WELL, THIS MARCH OF THE PENGUIN
ENDS WITH A TIME OF 4:39.

124
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I MADE IT! I MADE IT.

125
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
WHO'S NEXT?

126
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
WELL, BACK AT THE BIG BALLS

127
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
IS 34-YEAR-OLD CHRISSA ROBBY,
FROM SALEM, OREGON.

128
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
SALEM? SANTA!

129
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
IT'S A CHRISTMAS WITCH!
QUICK! SEE IF SHE FLOATS!

130
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
YEAH, SALEM, OREGON,
NOT MASSACHUSETTS.

131
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I THINK EVERY WOMAN HAS
A LITTLE BIT OF WITCH IN THEM.

132
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
SEE? VANESSA KNOWS
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

133
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
GUYS, THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS A CHRISTMAS WITCH.

134
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
TRUST ME, JOHN.
EVEN SANTA HAS A FEW ENEMIES.

135
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
AH, HA HA HA!
OH, HO HO!

136
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
OH, THE SNOWFALL KNOWS
HOW TO FLIP A WITCH.

137
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
IT TAKES A WICCAN...

138
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
MM.
OHH!

139
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
AND KEEPS ON TICKIN'.

140
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH
OF THIS CHRISTMAS FEAR.

141
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
GIVE ME
SOME CHRISTMAS CHEER.

142
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
(humming "Jingle Bells")
DONE. MEET WISCONSIN NATIVE
CAREY CONLEY.

143
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
OH, MAN. I WISH I COULD
GET THIS AS A RINGTONE.

144
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
OH, THAT'S IT.
YEAH, BACK THAT THING UP.

145
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
(stops humming)
(applause)

146
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
WELL, CAREY CALLS HER IMPRESSIVE
INSTRUMENT THE HUMAN KAZOO,

147
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
JOHNNY, AND SHE GAVE VANESSA
A QUICK MUSIC LESSON.

148
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR LIP
AND PUT IT UNDERNEATH YOUR TEETH

149
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
JUST LIGHTLY...
OKAY.

150
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
AND THEN HUM.
SO THEN THE VIBRATION--
(hums)

151
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
YOU'RE PRETTY CLOSE.

152
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
MOM, DAD! DID YOU KNOW
I COULD DO THAT?

153
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
(both humming
"We Wish You a Merry Christmas")

154
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I CAN KAZOO!

155
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
(laughs)

156
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'M A HUMAN KAZOO!
I COULD QUIT!

157
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
(John H.) WAIT, WHAT?

158
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I COULD GO
TOUR THE COUNTRY.

159
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
ABSOLUTELY.
(John H.)
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

160
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
YOU CAN'T QUIT
ON YOUR FIRST DAY.
(Vanessa)
THIS IS GREAT.

161
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
CAREY, IT'S SO NICE
TO MEET YOU...
(John H.) REALLY?
WE JUST BECAME BESTIES.

162
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
AND GOOD LUCK ON THE COURSE.
THANK YOU.
I WAS ABOUT TO BREAK UP WITH
ANDERSON TO MAKE ROOM FOR YOU.

163
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
(hums "We Wish You
a Merry Christmas")

164
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
(John A.)
WELL, THAT IS PRETTY GOOD.

165
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
TAKE THAT. MNH!

166
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
ALL RIGHT, MICK JAGGER.
TIME TO GET BACK TO WORK.

167
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
OH, YES.

168
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
(air horn blows)
ALL RIGHT, MR. NUTCRACKER.
YOU AND ME.

169
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
THAT'S RIGHT, HUMAN KAZOO CAREY.
YOU TELL HIM.

170
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I WONDER IF SHE'LL BLOW IT
ON THE SWEET NUTCRACKER.

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
YEAH? SEE WHAT I DID THERE?
"BLOW IT"? BECAUSE--

172
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
YOU'RE A PRO.

173
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
(hums, yells)

174
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
OH, SHE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO KAZOO RIGHT FOR A WEEK.

175
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
THE NUTCRACKER
IS WHOLESOME HOLIDAY FUN.

176
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
CAN WE SEE MORE, PLEASE?

177
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
AAH!

178
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
OHH, THAT HURTS ME
IN MY SUGARPLUMS.

179
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
AH, HA!
OH, HO HO HO!

180
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
OH, THEY'VE BEEN MAKING
BEAUTIFUL NUT MUSIC ALL DAY.

181
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
OOH!
AHH!

182
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
IT'S A CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR
OF WIPEOUTS.

183
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
NUTCRACKERS
WILL MAKE YOU CRY,

184
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
AND THEN
THEY'LL LAUGH AT YOU.

185
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
NOTHING IS BETTER
THAN CULTURE MIXED WITH...

186
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
OHH!
AH, HA--VIOLENCE.

187
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
OOF!
OHH!

188
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
RIGHT IN THE TUTU.

189
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
HO HO HO!
CHEST HAIR, DON'T FAIL ME NOW!

190
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
CHEST HAIR?
UHH!

191
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
OH! THAT IS
MICHAEL ANGELO GONZALEZ,

192
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
AND AS THE NAME SUGGESTS,
HE'S AN ARTIST.

193
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
WHAT'S CHEST HAIR
GOT TO DO WITH IT?

194
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
EVERYTHING, JOHN.

195
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
(Vanessa)
THAT IS FANTASTIC.

196
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
HOW DID YOU GET INTO
SHAVING YOUR CHEST?

197
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
NO, IT'S, UH,
JUST SOMETHING TO DO.

198
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
YOU HAVE CHEST HAIR, YOU MIGHT
AS WELL, YOU KNOW, DESIGN ON IT.

199
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
YOU HAVE A CANVAS, USE IT.

200
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
(John H.) AMEN, BROTHER,

201
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
BUT "WIPEOUT" IS REALLY
MORE OF A PERFORMANCE ART.

202
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
WHOO!

203
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
AHH!
OH, HO! RIGHT IN
THE GUGGEN-HEINIE.

204
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
SNOWFLAKES AREN'T
SUPPOSED TO HURT.

205
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
OH, VANESSA.
YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO LEARN.

206
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
SO LET'S NOT WASTE TIME.
BACK TO THE START.

207
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
'TIS THE SEASON
TO BE BALLSY!

208
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
WHOO-HOO!

209
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
WHOO-HOO! PAR-TAY!

210
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY'S

211
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
ALREADY BEEN DIPPING
INTO THE HOLIDAY SPIRITS.

212
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
THAT'S AMANDA CIURDAR,

213
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
AND SHE GAVE VANESSA
THE REAL STORY.

214
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
SO WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE THING
ABOUT CHRISTMAS?

215
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
OH, GOSH. I LOVE EGGNOG.
IT'S MY FAVORITE.

216
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
(John H.) WHAT-WHAT!
LET'S GET BLITZED!

217
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
DO YOU EVER SPIKE
YOUR EGGNOG?

218
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
(laughs) SHH.

219
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
(John H.)
DON'T BE ASHAMED, SISTER.

220
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
WITHOUT BOOZE,
IT'S JUST EGG JUICE AND NUTMEG.

221
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
WHAT'S A GUY GOT TO DO TO GET
BALLSY'S SECRET RECIPE, ANYWAY?
(air horn blows)

222
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
AMANDA OFF LIKE A SHOT
OF EGGNOG AND HOLIDAY CHEER.

223
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT SANTA
FEEDS HIS REINDEER,

224
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
ESPECIALLY BLITZEN.

225
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
WHOA!

226
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
WHOA, HO! GIDDYAP!
OH, HO!

227
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
AT THE TOP OF THE STEPS,
THERE AROSE QUITE A CLATTER,

228
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
BECAUSE BLITZEN GOT HIT
BY A NUTCRACKER BATTER.

229
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
BLITZEN CONTINUES
TO THE JINGLE BELLS,

230
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
A HO-HO-HO-TIVATOR HOVERING,
KIND OF LIKE

231
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
AN OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY
AT THE NORTH POLE, I'M GUESSING.

232
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
OHH!
AHH!

233
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
AND BARELY GOT A SNIFF
OF OUR $500 PRESENT.

234
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
WHAT, YOU REALLY EXPECT BLITZEN
NOT TO GET A LITTLE WOBBLY

235
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
AT THE CHRISTMAS PARTY?

236
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
JOHN, CHRISTMAS IS ABOUT
MORE THAN GETTING BLITZED.

237
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.

238
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
THAT'S WHY AMANDA'S HUSBAND
SAM CIURDAR IS ALSO HERE TODAY.

239
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
JIMINY CHRISTMAS!
BLITZEN HAS A HUSBAND?

240
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
WHY, I BET HE'S THE BIGGEST
CHRISTMAS PARTIER EVER!

241
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
UH, MAYBE HE'S STILL IN
A FOOD COMA FROM THANKSGIVING.

242
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
JANGLE YOUR JINGLE BELLS
AT HIM.

243
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
(bells jingle)

244
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
WOW.

245
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
WONDER IF HE WAS A LITTLE
MORE JOVIAL WITH VANESSA.

246
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
IT IS CHRISTMASTIME,

247
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
SO DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE
THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT WITH YOU?

248
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
BECAUSE YOU SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE READY TO GO.

249
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
UM, YES.

250
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
(John H., singsongy)
BORING.

251
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I AM SO EXCITED.
LET'S DO THIS.

252
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
(yawns)

253
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
(normal voice)
TALK ABOUT EBENEZER SNOOZE.

254
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I WONDER IF HE PERKS UP
IN COLD WATER.

255
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
WE'LL CERTAINLY
GET A CHANCE TO FIND OUT.

256
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
OHH, YI!

257
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
OH, GHOST OF CHRISTMAS REPLAY,
LET'S SEE THAT AGAIN.

258
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
HA HA HA!
OH, HO HO HO!

259
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
GOD BLESS US,
EVERY WIPEOUT.

260
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
WHAT A HEARTWARMING
CHRISTMAS STORY.

261
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
HOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT,
THESE THINGS YOU'VE SHOWN ME,

262
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
THESE WIPEOUTS--
ARE THEY REAL OR ONLY A DREAM?

263
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
NO, THEY--
THEY JUST HAPPENED.

264
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
WELL, CAN EBENEZER SNOOZE LEARN
THE TRUE MEANING OF WIPEOUT?

265
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
IS HIS FATE SET IN STONE?

266
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
YEAH, IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL,
ACTUALLY.

267
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
WE HAVE 12 MORE CONTESTANTS
THAT NEED TO RUN THE QUALIFIER,

268
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
SO ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

269
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
(sighs) THANK HEAVENS,
THERE'S STILL TIME!

270
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
THANK YOU,
HOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT!
MM-HMM.

271
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

272
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
YOU KNOW, UNLESS THIS
IS MY HORRIBLE DREAM,

273
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
WE'RE GONNA BE RIGHT BACK.

274
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
WHO ELSE WANTS A CHRISTMAS HUG,
HUH? COME HERE, YOU!

275
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
OW. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S A "NO."
ANYBODY ELSE WANT A HUG?

276
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
HEY, GOAT!
COME ON! COME BACK!

277
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Even though our mom tries,

278
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
she doesn't really get us.

279
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And she'll never know
who we are, or what...

280
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No way,
Madden Girls??

281
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Nike!

282
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
They're so awesome!

283
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Nike!

284
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Wow!
Yeahhhh!
Thank you!

285
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Who's your mommy now?

286
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's a
Christmas miracle.

287
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Give Victoriously.

288
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Famous brands. Famously easy.
Famous Footwear.

289
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Victory is Yours.

290
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You could keep your phone and
I lonumber.hone.

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But for half of what we pay now.

292
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Half?

293
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Really good progress today.

294
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000

Yes! Thank you! Yes! Yeah!

298

excited screaming and jumping

299
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Kids never get this excited
about clean teeth.

300
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes, yes , yes!

301
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But dogs do.

302
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This season, give the gift
that makes dogs giddy.

303
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And fights plaque and
tartar at the same time.

304
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Greenies dental chews.

305
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The treats vets recommend most

306
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
to make dental care fun
all year long.

307
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
♪

308
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
WELCOME BACK TO

309
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
THE "WINTER WIPEOUT--DECK

THANKS. IT'S BOATNECK.

YOU KNOW, ALL HOSTS OF MAJOR
TV SPECIALS DO COSTUME CHANGES.
MM-HMM.

313
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
YOU WANT ONE?
I GOT A WHOLE BAG OF 'EM.

314
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
NO, YEAH, ACTUALLY,
I LIKE THIS.

315
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
SUIT YOURSELF.
GET IT? "SUIT"?
MM-HMM.

316
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
(chuckles) 'CAUSE YOU'RE
WEARING A SUIT.

317
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
YEAH, I GOT IT.

318
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
THANKS.

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
SPEAKING OF HOSTS, WE SHOULD
CHECK IN ON THE NEW KID,

320
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
SEE HOW SHE'S DOING, YOU KNOW?
SHOW HER THE ROPES.
RIGHT.

321
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I FORGOT TO TELL HER
NOT TO LOOK BALLSY IN THE EYE.

322
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
WHAT ABOUT
THE SECRET INGREDIENT?

323
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
(John H.) WHAT?

324
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
IS HE GIVING VANESSA
THE SECRET EGGNOG RECIPE?

325
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
DON'T BE JEALOUS.

326
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'M NOT JEALOUS.
I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED.

327
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
MAN, HE IS
A REAL PLAYBALL.

328
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
WOULD A LITTLE CHRISTMAS CARNAGE
CHEER YOU UP?

329
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I MEAN, PROBABLY.

330
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE COURSE,

331
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000

335
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
NOT UNLIKE THE ONE
LEFT IN MY FOREHEAD

336
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
AT THE MALL
ON BLACK FRIDAY.

337
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
LITTLE GIRLS ARE
DECEPTIVELY STRONG, JOHN.

338
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
AHH!

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
THE NUTCRACKER

341
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
HE KNOCKED HER SILLY.

342
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
WELL, TICKLE ME SANDRA
WILL LOVE OUR CANDY CANES.

343
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
YOU KNOW, SHE RUNS ON CANDY...
AND DOUBLE "A" BATTERIES.

344
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
GREAT SNUFFLEUPAGUS!

345
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
WITH ANY BEST-SELLING TOY,

346
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
YOU GOT TO WATCH OUT
FOR CHEAP KNOCKOFFS.

347
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
TICKLE ME SANDRA'S
UP TO THE BIG BALLS.

348
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
LOBBYING SANTA FOR A SPOT UNDER
THE TREE--MARKETING GENIUS.

349
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
HO HO.
TICKLE ME SANDRA
GOES FLYING OFF THE SHELF.

350
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
OH, I'D WAIT IN LINE A WEEK
JUST TO SEE THAT AGAIN.

351
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
TICKLE ME SANDRA
AT THE TOP OF THE SNOWFALL...

352
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
(giggling)
AND GIGGLING
LIKE IT'S HER JOB.

353
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
OHH, HO,
MR. HOOPER'S GHOST!

354
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
THAT WAS A BELLY LAUGH.

355
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
WELL, HENSON THINKS
IT WAS AWESOME.

356
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
WHO ELSE
IS IN SANTA'S BAG?

357
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK.

358
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'VE GOT THIS IN THE BAG!

359
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
AND HE MEANS THAT LITERALLY.
MAN DESIGNS BAGS.

360
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I LOVE ME SOME FANNY PACKS.
VANESSA, TELL ME MORE.

361
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I AM DOWN HERE
WITH DAVID BRACKEN.

362
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
DAVID,
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

363
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
INDEED. IT'S CHRISTMAS,
AND I HAVE A PRESENT FOR YOU,

364
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
A "WIPEOUT" BAG
THAT I MADE.
YOU GOT ME A PRESENT?

365
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
INDEED.

366
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
DID YOU MAKE THIS?

367
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I DID. I MADE IT
OUT OF RECYCLED MATERIAL,

368
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
SO JUST LIKE "WIPEOUT,"
IT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.

369
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
(air horn blows)
(John H.) THE BAG MAN DAVID

370
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
IN THE UNFRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT
OF THE NUTCRACKER.

371
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
AND I'VE GOT THIS
IN THE BAG!

372
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
OHH, HO!
OH, HO! SWEET LORD!

373
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
HO HO HO.
THE NUTCRACKER PULVERIZED
EVERY NUT IN HIS BAG.

374
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
SANTA, PUT THIS IN THE BAG.

375
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
WOW, TWO SACK MASTERS
TALKING BAGS, JOHNNY.

376
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
IT'S A REAL
MEETING OF THE MINDS.

377
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
AHH!
AHH!

378
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
BAG MAN DAVID
IS BAGGED AND TAGGED,

379
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
BUT THERE ARE
MORE CONTESTANTS TO OPEN.

380
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
YEAH, UP AHEAD,
EMERGING FROM BALLSY'S EGGNOG,

381
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
22-YEAR-OLD EMILY SPOONRONG IS
UNDER A FULL-SCALE ELF ASSAULT.

382
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
AH, HA HA!
OHH!

383
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
(Vanessa)
JUST IGNORE THE FLYING TOYS.

384
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
ABSOLUTELY.
IGNORE YOUR FEELINGS.

385
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
THAT'S WHAT THE HOLIDAYS
ARE ALL ABOUT.

386
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
SEE? IT'S WORKING.
SHE'S ALMOST TO THE END.

387
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS
MAKE IT TO THE FINAL PLATFORM.
(quacks)

388
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
OH, HO!
OHH! WHAT THE DUCK?!

389
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
GOOD ONE. OUR CHRISTMAS DUCK
COOKED EMILY'S GOOSE.

390
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
AND WITH A TIME OF 5:42...
YEAH!

391
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
PROBABLY WON'T BE ADVANCING
TO THE NEXT ROUND.

392
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
WHERE'S OUR NEXT
CHRISTMAS STAR?

393
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
SHE'S BACK AT THE START.

394
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
18-YEAR-OLD AUTUMN BATES
IS GONNA GIVE IT A RUN.

395
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
THIS COURSE IS FOR NOOBS!

396
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
AND IN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW,
NOOBS ARE ROOKIES!

397
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
OH, YEAH.
I KNEW THAT, AUTUMN.

398
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
YOU DID?
WELL, DID YOU KNOW

399
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
THAT AUTUMN IS THE MASTER
OF FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER GAMES?

400
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
YES.

401
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
AUTUMN,
A.K.A. GamerGirl93,

402
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
HAS BEEN MY MULTIPLAYER NEMESIS
FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS,

403
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
BUT SHE'S IN MY HOUSE NOW,

404
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
AND I'M ABOUT TO SCORE
SOME POINTS.

405
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
(snaps fingers)
GO! MY CONTROLLER.

406
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

407
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I FITTED AUTUMN
WITH ONE OF OUR NEW GAMING VESTS

408
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO CONTROL
HER RUN THROUGH THE COURSE.

409
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
JOHN, YOU CAN'T
CONTROL A CONTESTANT.

410
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
WANNA BET?
(air horn blows)

411
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'M GONNA SHOW HER
HOW IT'S DONE--

412
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
HIGH SCORE, NO WIPEOUTS.

413
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
OW. ALL RIGHT.
AFTER THE NUTCRACKER.

414
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
EVERYBODY WIPES OUT
ON THAT STUNT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

415
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
BUT WATCH AS I ABSOLUTELY PWN
THE CANDY CANE.

416
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
DARN IT. SOMETHING'S WRONG
WITH MY CONTROLLER.

417
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
YEAH, LIKE,
YOU'RE NOT CONTROLLING HER.

418
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
NO WAY, ANDERSON. I GOT THIS.
WATCH. JUMP. JUMP!

419
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
OOH.
AW, MAN!

420
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I ALMOST GOT TO THE FOURTH BALL.
SHOULD HAVE TURNED OFF AUTO-AIM.

421
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
(screams)

422
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'LL HAVE TO RESPAWN.

423
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
YEAH, YOU KNOW

424
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
YOU HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO
WITH AUTUMN'S RUN.

425
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
WHAT, JOHN?
DON'T BE SUCH A NOOB, MAN.

426
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
AND--AND THIS?

427
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
WIRELESS?

428
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'M GUESSING NOT.

429
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
COULD WE PLEASE JUST
GET BACK DOWN TO THE COURSE

430
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
AND SEE WHO'S NEXT?

431
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
WHAT TIME IS IT?

432
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
CHRISTMASTIME!

433
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
JIM CASHMAN KNOWS
HIS CALENDAR, JOHNNY.

434
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
WHOA. HE CAN
TELL TIME AND DANCE?

435
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I GOTTA KNOW MORE.
VANESSA?

436
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
WHAT'S--WHAT'S
WITH THE COOKIE SHEET?

437
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I LOVE TO BAKE COOKIES.

438
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
YOU DO?
I DO.

439
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
THAT'S GREAT,
YET YOU DIDN'T BRING ANY.

440
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
YOU JUST BROUGHT THE PROP.
YOU'RE A COOKIE TEASE.

441
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
IMAGINATION.

442
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
(John H.) I CAN'T HAVE
IMAGINARY COOKIES.

443
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'M ALLERGIC
TO IMAGINARY GLUTEN.

444
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
JIM THE COOKIE TEASE ON HIS WAY
TO FACE A VERY REAL SANTA.

445
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
THERE'S A GUY
YOU DON'T WANT TO PRESENT

446
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
WITH AN EMPTY COOKIE PLATE.

447
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
OH, HO HO!
AH, HA!
HOLY SNICKERDOODLE!

448
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
THE COOKIE TEASE
WENT ALL THE WAY

449
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
WITH THE JINGLE BALLS.

450
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
ALL PART OF THE SEASON
OF GIVING, JOHN,

451
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000

THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF JOYS
FOR GOOD GIRLS AND BOYS,

454
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
HOORAY! SNOWBALL FIGHT!

458
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000

ABOUT CHRISTMAS? SANTA.

459
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
OHH!
HEY!

460
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
AND DON'T FORGET
THE ATTACK ELVES.

461
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
SWEET GUMDROPS,
THEY'VE GOT VANESSA!

462
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
OH, HO HO!

463
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
(deep voice)
MERRY CHRISTMAS! HO HO--NRR.

464
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
IT REALLY IS THE MOST WONDERFUL
TIME OF THE YEAR.

465
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
SAD TO SEE IT END, JOHNNY,
BUT WE ARE DOWN

466
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
TO OUR LAST CONTESTANT,
WHO'S WITH VANESSA.

467
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
THANK YOU, GUYS, SO MUCH.

468
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'M DOWN HERE NOW
WITH SHAWN TOWNSEND.

469
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

470
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
YEAH!

471
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
WOW, YOU'RE VERY EXCITED
ABOUT CHRISTMAS.

472
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
YES, MA'AM.
I-I LIVE FOR CHRISTMAS.

473
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
THE ENTIRE MONTH OF NOVEMBER,
JUST COUNT ME OUT,

474
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
BECAUSE I DON'T DO ANYTHING
BUT CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

475
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
CAN YOU SEE IT FROM SPACE?

476
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
UNFORTUNATELY, YES.

477
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
(John H.) UNFORTUNATELY?
OWN IT, CAPTAIN CHRISTMAS!

478
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
YOU'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING THAT SAYS,

479
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
"I LOVE CHRISTMAS
MORE THAN YOU."

480
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
LET'S GIVE SANTA'S WORKSHOP
A LITTLE BLING, SHALL WE?

481
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
SEEMS LIKE A WASTE
OF ELECTRICITY.

482
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
NAH, WE JUST CUT THE HEAT
IN YOUR TRAILER.

483
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
UH-OH!
THE ATTACK ELVES LOOK HUNGRY.

484
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
HOLD ME.

485
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
NOPE.

486
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
OH, YOU HATE TO SEE
THE MINIONS OF SANTA

487
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
TURN THIS INTO
A HATE CAPTAIN CHRISTMAS CRIME.

488
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
OH, HO HO, MAN.

489
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
IT'S JUST TOYS, SHAWN.
THEY'RE JUST TOYS.

490
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
YES, BUT EVEN PLUSH TOYS,

491
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
DANGEROUS IN THE HANDS OF
HIGHLY TRAINED BLACK OP ELVES.

492
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
IGNORE ALL THE FLYING OBJECTS.
BE ONE WITH YIN.

493
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
(yells)

494
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
OHH!
AHH!

495
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
VANESSA, NOT EVEN YOU

496
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
CAN KEEP A MAN SAFE

CLEARLY, DECORATING

854
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.

855

SPEAKING OF WHICH,
WE HAVE A BRAND-NEW OBSTACLE

856

THE COLDHEARTED SNAKE...

859
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000

YES, I NAMED IT

863
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000

PAULA ABDUL SONG.

864
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
SECOND-FAVORITE.

865
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
YEAH, "VIBEOLOGY" JUST DIDN'T
MAKE SENSE FOR CHRISTMAS.

866
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I GET THAT, AS LONG AS
IT MAKES SENSE TO YOU.

867
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000

NO, HE'S NOT HOLDING A BAG.

912
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THEY DON'T
KNOW HIS CATCHPHRASE YET?

913
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
IT'S ALL HE SAYS.

914
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000

00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
COOKIE TEASE
IN THE GREEN NOW.

1173
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
EXIT PLATFORM
ALL LINED UP FOR HIM

1174
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
IF HE CAN JUST GET
INTO POSITION TO JUMP.

1175
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
OH, MAN. I'M MAKING THIS
A LITTLE DIFFICULT.

1176
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
JIM WORKING ON SOME COOPERATION
WITH THE ROTATION.

1177
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
GOTTA KEEP REESTABLISHING
YOUR POSITION.

1178
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
LITTLE BEHIND HERE.
GOING FOR IT.

1179
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
A BOLD MOVE! YEAH!

1180
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
OH! I DIDN'T THINK
HE WAS GONNA MAKE THAT.

1181
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
ON HIS WAY
TO THE FROZEN FURY NOW.

1182
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
THE EFFORT AND THE EFFECTS
OF THAT COLD

1183
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
STARTING TO TIGHTEN UP
THOSE MUSCLES.
(grunts)

1184
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
LOOK OUT!
(laughs)

1185
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
CAUGHT BY THE BAR

1186
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
AND BACK INTO THE ZONE'S
FRIGID WATERS.
WHOA!

1187
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
YEAH, COOKIE TEASE
JUST COULDN'T GET OVER,

1188
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
AND HE HAS GOT TO BE
TURNING BLUE IN FRUSTRATION.
WHOA!

1189
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
JIM BURNED UP A LOT OF TIME

1190
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
WITH THAT 18-FOOT CLIMB
BACK TO THE FROZEN FURY.

1191
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
HE IS UP AND OVER
THAT FIRST BAR.

1192
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
KEEPS MOVING. HE MIGHT HAVE
THIS OBSTACLE SORTED OUT.

1193
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
SURGING AHEAD,
CLEARS ANOTHER,

1194
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
AND LOPES OVER TO THE SAFETY
OF THE PLATFORM.
WHOO!

1195
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
TWO-THIRDS OF THIS NIGHTMARISH
WIPEOUT ZONE...
WHOO!

1196
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
NOW IN HIS REARVIEW,

1197
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
ONE OBSTACLE LEFT TO GO--
ICED OVER.

1198
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I'M AS TIRED AS SANTA CLAUS
AFTER DELIVERING PRESENTS.

1199
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
YEAH, BUT STILL NOT HOME.
BELLY FLOPS FORWARD. OH, HO HO!

1200
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
THE EXPLOSION OF
THAT WATER CANNON SO UNNERVING.
(laughs)

1201
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
OHH!
OH! AND THE COOKIE TEASE IS
DUNKED.

1202
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
YEAH, JIM CASHMAN TOSSED
HEAD OVER HEELS...

1203
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
(slo-mo voice) AAH!

1204
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
AND BACK INTO THE WATER FOR
ANOTHER LONG, EXHAUSTING SWIM.

1205
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
CLOCK TICKING PAST
THE 14-MINUTE MARK NOW.

1206
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
IT'S A DIFFICULT COURSE
TONIGHT,

1207
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT TIME'S
GONNA HOLD UP.

1208
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
COOKIE TEASE
BALANCED AND STEADY

1209
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
ON THE SECOND DIAMOND.

1210
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
BEARING DOWN ON THE THIRD.

1211
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
YEAH, CLEARS THAT GAP.

1212
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
NOW FOR THE FINAL PAYOFF.

1213
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
AND HE LANDS IT, JOHNNY.
YEAH. WELL DONE.

1214
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
WHOO! ALL RIGHT!
JIM CASHMAN HAS FINISHED
THE WINTER WIPEOUT ZONE

1215
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
WITH A TIME
OF 14 MINUTES, 25 SECONDS.
WHOO! YES!

1216
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
HOPING TO BEST THAT TIME--
THE BAG MAN DAVID BRACKEN.

1217
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
LET'S SEE HOW HE GOT HERE.

1218
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
THE BAG MAN DAVID BRACKEN
GOT SACKED EARLY TODAY,

1219
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
BARELY SURVIVING
OUR CHRISTMAS QUALIFIER.

1220
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
PUT THIS IN THE BAG.

1221
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
HE SHOWED HE COULD
WITHSTAND PAIN IN THE ICE...
OOH!

1222
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
AND NOW AFTER COMING IN FIRST
ON THE COLDHEARTED SNAKE...
AAH!

1223
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
HE'S HOPING HE'LL NEED A BAG
BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD $50,000.

1224
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
BAG MAN READY TO GO
ATOP KILLER LUGE.

1225
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
14:25 THE TIME TO BEAT.

1226
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
THERE GO THE LIGHTS,
THERE'S THE COUNTDOWN,
(beeping)

1227
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
AND THAT'S A 70-FOOT DROP.

1228
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
WHOA, HO HO HO!

1229
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
WAHOO!

1230
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
SEALED AND DELIVERED.

1231
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
ROLL BACK THE REPLAY
AND WATCH

1232
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
AS DAVID STARTS DOWN
AND ACCELERATES

1233
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
FOR THE FLIGHT OF HIS LIFE...
AAH!

1234
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
BEFORE A CRASH LANDING
INTO THAT FREEZING WATER.

1235
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
UP THE LADDER NOW

1236
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
TO THE FANTASTIC
PSYCHEDELIC SNOW GLOBE.

1237
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
(speaks indistinctly)
THAT BUTTON IN THE CENTER
IS KEY.

1238
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
IT TRIGGERS
THE LANDING PLATFORM.
HELLO!

1239
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
(laughs)
OH, THAT WAS GOOD, THOUGH.

1240
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
BAG MAN TOUGHING IT OUT.

1241
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
WORKING DOWN TO THE CENTER.

1242
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
RELEASES THE EXIT PLATFORM.

1243
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
ALL RIGHT, NOW HE'S GOTTA FIND
A WAY OUT.

1244
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
IN THE BAG, NOT THE DRINK.

1245
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
MANEUVERING ACROSS
THOSE PEGS.

1246
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
OH, DICEY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM.

1247
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
OH!
REALLY BAD BODY POSITION.

1248
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
AAH!
OH, HE COULDN'T HOLD ON.

1249
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
OH, HO!

1250
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
BAG MAN TRIED TO FLIP HIMSELF
ONTO THAT NEXT PEG...

1251
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
(slo-mo voice) AAH!

1252
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
BUT DIDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH
TO HOLD ON.

1253
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
NEARING THE 3 1/2-MINUTE MARK

1254
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
AS HE STARTS
HIS SECOND ATTEMPT.

1255
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
OHH! MAY BE
A LITTLE BRUISED THERE.

1256
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
BAG MAN GETTING A BREAK, THOUGH.
PLATFORM ALREADY DOWN,

1257
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
SO HE CAN CRAWL
DIRECTLY ACROSS.

1258
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
AAH!
WELL-PLAYED.

1259
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
YEAH. BAG MAN DAVID BRACKEN
MADE IT TO THE FROZEN FURY.

1260
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
ALMOST TWO MINUTES AHEAD

1261
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
OF COOKIE TEASE'S PACE
AT THIS POINT.

1262
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
HE IS FLYING THAT.

1263
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
LET'S SEE IF HE CAN EXTEND
HIS LEAD HERE.

1264
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
HERE HE GOES.
STEPS ONTO THE PLATFORM,

1265
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
A LEAP OVER. OH! WOW.
(grunts) AAH!

1266
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
WHAT A LETDOWN, HUH?

1267
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
WOW! ONE HASTY JUMP...
AAH!

1268
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
AND DAVID IS SOAKING HIS BAG
IN COLD WATER AGAIN.

1269
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
A LOT OF ENERGY SPENT
FOR A DO-OVER.
IT'S IN THE BAG.

1270
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
A LOT LESS CONVICTION
IN HIS SMACK TALK.

1271
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
COMING UP
ON 9 MINUTES NOW.

1272
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
HE'S RUNNING OUT OF TIME,

1273
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
BUT HE STILL HAS THE CHANCE
TO TAKE THE LEAD.

1274
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
A LITTLE MORE
SURE-FOOTED THIS TIME.

1275
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
CAN'T HAVE ANOTHER MISTAKE.

1276
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
JUST ONE MORE SWEEPER BAR
TO GO.

1277
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
CLEARS THAT ONE AND THEN
BOUNDS ONTO THE PLATFORM.

1278
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
YEAH! BAG MAN DAVID NOW ON
THE LAST OBSTACLE, ICED OVER,

00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
OH! HIS TIME AND FACE
TAKING A BEATING THERE.

1287
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
IT'S GONNA BE TIGHT NOW.

1288
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
A LITTLE MORE THAN 15 SECONDS
TO FINISH THE COURSE.

1289
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
HE'S ONTO THE FIRST DIAMOND.

1290
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
GOOD THERE. 10 TICKS LEFT.

1291
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
OHH!

1292
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000

OH!
OH, NO!

1296
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
SO CLOSE!

1297
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
BAG MAN CAN'T LAND THE JUMP,

1298
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
AND 50K SLIPS

1347
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
YEAH, WHERE IT'S BEEN ANYTHING
BUT A SILENT NIGHT.

1348
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
HOT LIGHTS! WE'VE SEEN
TWO RUNS IN THE ZONE

1349
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
WITH ONE STILL TO GO.

1350
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
OUR LEADER,
COOKIE TEASE JIM CASHMAN,

1351
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
CAME IN WITH A TIME
OF 14 MINUTES, 25 SECONDS.

1352
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
AIMING TO BEAT THAT MARK,
A MAN WITH VISIONS

1353
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
OF 50 LARGE DANCING
IN HIS HEAD--

1354
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
EBENEZER SNOOZE SAM CIURDAR.
LET'S DO THIS! WHOO!

1355
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
LET'S REVIEW HOW HE ARRIVED HERE
AT THE WINTER WIPEOUT ZONE.
WHOO!

1356
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
EBENEZER SNOOZE SAM CIURDAR WAS
STINGY WITH EXCITEMENT

1357
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
THIS MORNING WHEN HE RAN
THE QUALIFIER.

1358
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
HE SLEEPWALKED THROUGH
THE PAIN IN THE ICE,

1359
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
LANDING
AN UNEXCITING POSITION...
(groans)

1360
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
BUT NOW, AFTER A CHANGE
OF CHARACTER...
WHOO!

1361
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
HE'S GOT THE "WIPEOUT" SPIRIT
IN TIME...
AAH!

1362
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
TO PUT HIMSELF IN STRIKING
DISTANCE OF THE 50K.

1363
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
OUR MAN IN POSITION
ON KILLER LUGE,

1364
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
FROM SEVEN STORIES
UP IN THE FROSTY AIR.

1365
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
THE TIME TO BEAT--14:25.

1366
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
(beeping)
THE LIGHT SHOW SIGNALS
THE START OF OUR SHOW.

1367
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
EBENEZER SNOOZE IS OFF,
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

1368
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
WOW!
AAH!

1369
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
YOU SNOOZE, YOU LUGE, JOHN.

1370
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.
GAINING SPEED,

1371
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
HE SKYROCKETS INTO THE AIR...
AAH!

1372
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
AND THRASHES RIGHT INTO
THOSE FRIGID WATERS.

1373
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
WOW.

1374
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
WHAT DO WE DO HERE?

1375
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.
YOU JUST GET IN, CLIMB ACROSS,

1376
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
TAG THE CENTER, DROP THE EXIT,
LAND THE JUMP.

1377
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
EBENEZER SNOOZE IN ACTION,

1378
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
PICKING HIS WAY DOWN.

1379
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
OH, BOY. BAD SLIP. OH!

1380
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
OH, HO HO!
BAD RESULTS.

1381
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
EBENEZER SNOOZE
SLIPS AND SLIDES...

1382
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
(grunting)

1383
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
PINBALLING THROUGH
THE SNOW GLOBE

1384
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
WITH NOTHING TO HOLD ON TO.

1385
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
(grunts)

1386
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
HERE GOES NOTHING. UHH!

1387
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
SECOND GO-AROUND
OF THIS THING.

1388
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
STILL NEEDS TO REACH
THE CENTER BUTTON.

1389
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
DONE.

1390
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
(grunts)
EXIT PLATFORM'S IN PLACE NOW.

1391
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
EBENEZER RUNNING JUST BEHIND
THE PACE SET BY COOKIE TEASE.

1392
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
EBENEZER STAYING HIGH,
LOOKING TO MAKE THAT LEAP.

1393
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
GOES FOR IT.

1394
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
UHH!
OH, YES. SPOT ON.

1395
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
NICE.
OH, SHOOT.

1396
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
EBENEZER SNOOZE
ON THE FROZEN FURY NOW,

1397
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
STILL WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE
OF COOKIE TEASE'S PACE.

1398
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
BUT IF HE'S GONNA CATCH UP,
HE HAS GOT TO MOVE.

1399
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
STILL PAYS TO BE CONSERVATIVE,
JOHNNY.

1400
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
IN THESE ICY CONDITIONS,
THE PLATFORM SO SLIPPERY.

1401
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
STRUGGLING TO GET UP.
(grunts)

1402
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
OH, NO!

1403
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
NOT QUITE ENOUGH DISTANCE.
SHORTS IT.

1404
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
EBENEZER SNOOZE DOESN'T GET UP
IN TIME

1405
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
AND GETS ANOTHER
HYPOTHERMIC WAKEUP CALL.

1406
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
THE WIPEOUTS, THE SWIMS,
THE CLIMBS--

1407
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
ALL THREE BEATING UP
EBENEZER SNOOZE AND THE CLOCK.

1408
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
BACK IN THE LINE OF FIRE
NOW.

1409
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
OH! A LITTLE SCORPION HIT
ON THAT ONE.

1410
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
OH, HO! CLOSING IN
ON 10 MINUTES.

1411
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
SAM HAS A REAL CHANCE
TO PULL AHEAD OF COOKIE TEASE

1412
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
IF HE CAN MAKE IT THROUGH.

1413
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
EBENEZER'S WIDE AWAKE NOW,
JOHNNY.

1414
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
ONE JUMP TO SAFETY, AND HE'S
GOT IT. HE HAS GOT IT.

1415
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
OH, HE'S LOOKING GOOD.

1416
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
INDEED. AN EXHAUSTED EBENEZER

1417
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
HAS CAUGHT UP WITH
COOKIE TEASE JIM CASHMAN.

1418
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
ONTO THE FIRST DIAMOND.
GOING FOR THE SECOND.

1419
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
(grunts)
NO, SIR!

1420
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
OH, HO!

1421
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
SAM GETS THE SNOOZE
KNOCKED OUT OF HIM...

1422
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
(grunts)

1423
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
AND HE FACES
ANOTHER LONG, GRUELING SWIM.

1424
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
THIS IS HIS LAST SHOT AT IT.
(grunts)

1425
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
OH!
OH!

1426
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
A GUT SHOT,
BUT IN GOOD POSITION.

1427
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
HERE'S THE SECOND ONE.

1428
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
(grunts)

1429
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
POOR GUY. TAKING IT RIGHT
IN THE BREAD BASKET.

1430
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
HE HAS THE FINISH
IN HIS SIGHTS.

1431
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
JOHNNY,
20 SECONDS TO GET THERE.

1432
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
$50,000 WAITING FOR HIM
IF HE CAN PULL THIS OFF.

1433
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
16 SECONDS. JUST ONE JUMP AWAY
FROM VICTORY.

1434
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
YES!
NO WAY!

1435
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000

AND THAT IS THE MOST ENERGY
WE HAVE SEEN FROM HIM ALL DAY.

1436
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
