WOULD HAVE PARTICIPATING IN

225
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000

CHILDREN WERE NOT COMING HOME.

363
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000

DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT.

373
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
SUFFICE TO SAY THERE WERE

374
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
DECEASED IN TWO CLASSROOMS AND

375
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000

378
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
WE HAVE A STATE POLICE COMMAND

382
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
QUESTION AND WE'LL DO AN

383

HISTORY AND HISTORICAL EVENS

386
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
THAT THIS YOUNG MAN MAY HAVE

387
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
BEEN INVOLVED N. AND WE'LL

388
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED.

389
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
>> DID THE SCHOOL KNOW HIM OR

390
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
MOTHER COMPLAIN OR WORRIED

391
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
ABOUT HIM?
>> THERE WAS NOTHING THAT

392
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
SHOWED THAT SOMETHING LIKE

393
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
THIS COULD OCCUR .

394
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
OUR AT

395
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
ALL OF THAT AND CERTAINLY LOOK

396
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
AT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE

397
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000

398
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000

AND THIS ISENDLESS AND WE'LL

399
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
DO EVERYTHING WE HAVE TO

400
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS.

401
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND

402
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
CLEAR IT UP FOR ME AND I READ

403
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
OR HEARD THAT THE MOTHER WAS

404
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
FOUND DEAD AT HER HOME AND

405
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
ALSO A TEACHER.

406
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
WAS SHE NOT TEACHING OR CALL

407
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
IN SICK.

408
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
WHY WAS SHE NOT AT SICK?

409
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
>> WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED

410
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
OFFICIALLY ANYONE YET.

411
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I CAN TELL YOU, WE HAVE A

412
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
SECONDARY SCENE WITH A

413
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
DECEASED FEPLAIL WHO WE

414
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
TENTATIVELY IDENTIFIED .

415
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
THOSE ARE QUESTIONS WE HAVE

416
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
AND WILL HAVE TO ANSWER.

417
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
NCAN YOU TELL ME WHETHER THERE

418
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
WAS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER IN

419
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
THE CLASS ROM.

420
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I AM SORRY I DON'T KNOW.

421
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
>> MEDICAL EXAMINERS IN WITH

422
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
THE CHILDREN AND ADULTINGS.

423
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
>> MEDICAL EXAMINERS ARE THERE

424
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
WITH THE TEEM IN PLACE.

425
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
AND THEY ARE GOING TO WORK

426
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AND DO

427
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
WHATEVER THEY NEED TO DO TO

428
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
IDENTIFY THE CHILDREN FOR THE

429
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
FAMILIES.
>> EVERY TIME I RECOVER THE

430
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
STORY, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

431
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
THER ALL PARTNER THEY GO INTO

432
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
THESE SCENES AND IT IS JUST

433
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
UNTHINKABLE AND UNPEEKABLE.

434
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
THEY ALL HAVE KIDS THE AGE OF

435
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
THESE CHILDREN MUCH.

436
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
>> IT IS IT A VERY SCENE FOR

437
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
THEM.
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

438
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
WHO INTERESTED THE BUILDING WE

439
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
HAVE PROVIDED THEM WITH

440
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
COUNSELING AND WE DID THE SAME

441
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
FOR THE FAMILY THAT BROUGHT IN

442
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
CLERGY .
IT IS IT HARD FOR LAW ENFORCE

443
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
MS PERSONNEL AND CERTAINLY

444
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
NOTHING LIKE WHAT THE PARTNERS

445
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
ARE GOING THROUGH.

446
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
>> NO PARENT WANTS TO SEND HIS

447
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
CHILD TO SCHOOL WITH A PRISON

448
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
AND LOTS OF METAL DETECTORS,

449
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
BUT I AM CURIOUS, WAS THE

450
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
SECURITY NOT THAT I AM

451
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
CONDEMNING IF IT HASN'T.

452
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
YOU IT GOES BOTH WAYS.

453
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
>> SUFFICE TO SAY THE SCHOOL

454
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
WAS VERY SECURE.

455
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
AND WHY WILL CERTAINLY

456
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW THE

457
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
SHOOTER WAS ABLE TO GAIN

458
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
ACCESS .

459
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
>> SECURE IN A SENSE IF I

460
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
TRIED TO GET IN SOMEBODY WOULD

461
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
STOP ME AND SOMEBODY WILL LET

462
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
ME IN.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

463
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
YOU COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN IN.

464
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
>> GOOD LUCK AND IF IS TOUGH

465
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
ON YOU AND ESPECIALLY THE

466
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
FAMILIES OF THE DEAD.

467
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
THANK YOU, SIR .

468
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
OUR LIVE COURAGE CONTINUES IN

469
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
A MINUTE.

470
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THE LONG

471
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000

FROM NEWTOWN, STAY WITH US.

474
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I JUST KNEW WE HAD TO GET IN

475
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
THERE AND IT IS IT GOING TO BE

476
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
OKAY AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE

477
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
ALL RIGHT I PULL WOULD A BOOK

478
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
SHELF AND WE WERE BARRICADED

479
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
AND DID YOU TELL THEM TO BE

480
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
QUIET.
NDID YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT.

481
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
>> I TOLD THEM TO BE

482
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
ABSOLUTELY QUIET.

483
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
BECAUSE I WAS SO AFRAID HE

484
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
WOULD COME IN AND HEAR US AND

485
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
START SHOOTING THE DOR.

486
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
WE HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTELY

487
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
QUIET.

488
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
AND WE HAVE.

489
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
THERE ARE BAD GOYS OUT THERE

490
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
NOW.

491
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
AND WE NEED TO WAIT FOR THE

492
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
GOOD GUYS.

493
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I JUST WANTED US TO BE OKAY.

494
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
AND I AM SO SADDENED THRATHERE

495
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
ARE PIME IN THE SITUATION THAT

496
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
ARE NOT OKAY.

497
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
MY HEART GOES OUT TO WHO KNEW

498
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
THEM AND WAS PART OF THEIR

499
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
LIVES.

500
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
>> WE ARE BACK LIVE IN

501
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

502
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
THE PRETTY NEW ENGLAND TOWN

503
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
NOW THE SCENE OF ONE OF THE

504
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
DEADLIEST SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IN

505
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
HISTORY.

506
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
ADAM LANZA IS THE KILLER,

507
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
FIRST REPORTS IDENTIFIED HIS

508
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
BROTHER RYAN LANZA AS THE

509
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
KILLER.

510
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN.

511
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
CLAR MOSES JOINS US.

512
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
HOW DID IT HAPPEN THAT THERE

513
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
WAS CONFUSION AND YOU SPOKE TO

514
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
FRENS OF RYAN, HAVE YOU NOT?

515
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
>> I DID SPEAK TO FRIENDS OF

516
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
RYAN.

517
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFUSION

518
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
AND THE INTERNET START TOD

519
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
PUBLISH RYAN PICTURES AND THEY

520
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
CALLED HIM THE KILLER.

521
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
AT THAT VERY MOMENT I TALKED

522
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
TO SOME OF HIS FRIENDS BY TEXT

523
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
AND PHONE AND THEY TOLD ME, I

524
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
POKE TO THREE OF HIS FRIENDS

525
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
AND THEY HAD SPOKEN TO HIM

526
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
BRIEFLY ON BOOK BOOK CHAT OR

527
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
BY PHONE AND HE WAS IN FACT AT

528
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
WORK AND NOT THE KILLER .

529
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
IT WAS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE

530
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
FOR HIM TO BE IN NEWTOWN WHILE

531
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
HE WAS AT WORK AND TALKING ON

532
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
THE PHONE TO HIS FRIENDS.

533
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
>> BUT YOU KNOW.

534
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
>> YES?

535
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
>> DO YOU KNOW IF HIS FRIENDS,

536
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
DID ANY OF RYAN'S FRIEND EVER

537
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
MET ADAM?

538
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
>> NOT THE ONES THAT I SPOKE

539
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
TO.

540
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
THEY KNEW HE HAD A BROTHER AND

541
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
THAT IS ABOUT THE EXTENT OF

542
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
THEIR KNOWLEDGE.

543
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
THEY HAD BRIEF CONVERSATIONS

544
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
WITH HIM TODAY AS YOU CAN

545
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
IMAGINE IT WAS A CRAZY DAY FOR

546
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
HIM SO THEY JUST HAD A FEW

547
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
MINUTES AND THEY KNEW HE HAD A

548
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
BROTHER BUT NONE OF THEM

549
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
SEEMED TO KNOW ADAM.

550
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
>> DID THEY KNOW ANYTHING

551
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
ABOUT ADAM, DID RYAN EVER PEEK

552
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
ABOUT ADAM OR DESCRIBE UNUSUAL

553
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
OR NOT UNUSUAL OR A

554
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM OR

555
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
ANYTHING?

556
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
>> THERE IS VERY LITTLE

557
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THAT.

558
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
ONE OF HIS FRIENDS DID TELL ME

559
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
IN FACT, HE HAD A BROTHER AND

560
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A

561
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
LITTLE CHALLENGED, AND

562
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
DEVELOPMENTALLY CHALLENGED BUT
THAT IS ALL OF THE

563
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
INFORMATION.
OTHER INFORMATION IS VERY

564

WAY AND IT WAS PROBABLY ADAM

583
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
RATHER THAN HIMSELF.

584
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
CHILD AND TO BE THERE TO

729
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
PROTECT THEM.

CALL THAT THERE WAS A SHOOTING

732
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
AND THEY SAY WHERE AND THE

733
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
SCHOOLS ARE ON LOCK DOWN AND

734
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT I GOT A

735
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000

HOOK.

738
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
AND SO I LEFT AND WENT TO THE

KNEW AND I SAID WHAT IS GOING

742
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
ON.
SHE SAID THE PRINCIPAL IS DEAD

743
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
AND THE CHILDREN CAME OUT WITH

744
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
BLOOD.

745
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
>> WE ARE COPING AND TRYING TO

746
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON.

747
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
IT IS IT NERVE RACKING.

GROUP, AND THEY STARTED TO

752
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
HEARING I GUESS BANGS.

753
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
AND HER TEACHER WHICH I AM SO

754
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
GRATEFUL FOR.

755
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
IT WAS A SMALL GROUP.

756
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
THEY RUSHED THE KIDS INTO THE

757
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
BATHROOM AND THEY LOCKED THE

758
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
DOOR AND THEY JUST TOLD THE

759
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
CHILDREN IT WAS HAMMERING AND

760
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
TRIED TO KEEP THEM CALM.

761
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,

762
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
BECAUSE IT IS HARD TO GET THE

763
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
COMPLETE STORY, THE NEXT THING

764
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I KNOW IS THAT THE POLICE CAME

765
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
AND THEY WERE KNOCKING ON THE

766
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
DOOR TO BE LET OUT.

767
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
WHEN THEY WERE SHE SAW GLASS

768
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
AND BLOOD AND ONE CHILD

769
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
COVERED IN BLOOD BUT I

770
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
UNDERSTAND THAT CHILD IS SAFE

771
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
.

772
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
>> SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW

773
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
THE WHILE SHE WAS WALKING DOWN

774
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
THE HALLWAY, THE POLICE TOLD

775
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
THEM TO CLOSE THEIR EYES.

776
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A SENSITIVE

777
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
SCENE AND SHE SAID SHE HEARD

778
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
GUN SHOTS AND ACTUALLY WHAT

779
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
SHE TOLD ME WAS IN THE

780
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
BEGINNING, THE INTERCOM CAME
ON AND SHE HEARD A SCREAM ON

781
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
THE INTERCOM AND IT WENT

782
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
IMMEDIATELY OFF.

783
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I AM NOT SURE AT THE SPECIFICS

784
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
OF THE LOCK DOWN.

785
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
>> NOTHING MAKES SENSE LIKE

786
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
THIS.
NO IT DOESN'T.

787
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
OUR HEARTS ARE WITH EVERYBODY.

788
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
EVERY PARENT AND MOTHER AND

789
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
FATHER AND GRAND FATHER AND

790
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
MOTHER AND SISTER AND BROTHER

791
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
FOR ALL OF THE CHILDREN.

792
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
>> SHE SEEMED TO BE DOING

793
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
OKAY.
BUT A COUPLE OF FRIENDS WE

794
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
HAVEN'T GOTTEN IN TOUCH WITH.

795
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
WE HOPE THAT EVERYTHING IS

796
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
OKAY WITH THEM.

797
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
NCOMING UP MORE LIVE COVERAGE

798
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
FROM NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT AND

799
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
WHY THE PLICE ARE IN THE

800
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
SCHOOL.

801
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
DETECTIVE MARK FUR@6

802
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
>> TONIGHT THE INVESTIGATION

803
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
IN THE CONNECTICUT MASS

804
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
SHOOTING IS ONLY BEGINNING.

805
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
THE HOMICIDE DETECTIVE MARK

806
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
FURMAN JOINS US.

807
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
>> GOOD EVENING.

808
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
>> MARK, YOU AND I GO BACK A

809
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
LONG TIME TALKING ABOUT ALL OF

810
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
THESE CASES.
THIS ONE TONIGHT, RIGHT NOW AS

811
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
WE TALK.

812
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER INSIDE OF

813
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
THAT CLASSROOM, AND BODIES

814
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
STILL IN THE CLASSROOM AND

815
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
TRYING TO DETERMINE IDEPTITY.

816
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW

817
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THE POLICE

818
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
AND MEDICAL EXAMINER AND

819
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
FAMILIES AND EVERYTHING.

820
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
THIS HAS TO BE DONE, DOESN'T

821
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
IT?

822
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
>> IT DOES HAVE TO BE DONE,

823
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
GRETA AND UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN

824
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
IMAGINE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND

825
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
YOU TRY TO PUT THAT OUT OF

826
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
YOUR MIND.

827
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER AND

828
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
FORENSIC PERSONNEL HAVE TO

829
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
BLUE PRIPT THE ROOM WHERE EACH

830
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
AND EVERY PERSON IS.

831
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
ALL EVIDENCE HAS TO BE

832
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
PHOTOGRAPHED BEFORE IT IS

833
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
DISTURBED AND YOU HAVE TO

834
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
NUMBER AND THE POSITIONS OF

835
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
EACH BODY.

836
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
EACH BODY HAS TO BE PROCESSED

837
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
AND EXAMINED BY THE CORONER

838
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
AND FORENSICALLY AND

839
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
DOCUMENTED AND EVIDENCE

840
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
COLLECTED AND THEN, AND ONLY

841
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
THEN CAN YOU REMOVE EACH BODY

842
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
ONE AT A TIME.

843
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK OF THE

844
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
FAMILIES TONIGHT.

845
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
THEY HAVEN'T GOT KNOW OFFICIAL

846
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
WORD THEIR CHILD IS DEAD OR A

847
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
LOVED ONE OR WIFE OR MOTHER.

848
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
BUT IF YOU ARE SITTING AT HOME

849
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
AND YOU ARE EXPECTING YOUR

850
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
CHILD TO BE HOME OR EXPECTED

851
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
YOUR WIFE OR MOTHER OR FATHER

852
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
TO BE HOME AND THAT PERSON

853
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
HASN'T SHOWN UP.

854
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT YOU

855
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
ARE -- YOUR FAMILY MEMBER WAS

856
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
A VICTIM AND A LOT OF PEOPLE

857
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
ARE THINKING WHY IN THE WORLD

858
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
GOING ON.
WE KNOW WHO THE SHOOTER IS.

859
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
HE SHOT HIMSELF IN THE HEAD

860
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
AND THERE IS IT A RISK OF A

861
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
CO-DEFENDANT OR SOMEONE WHO

862
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
HELPED HIM AND YOU WILL HAVE

863
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
TO PUT A CASE TOGETHER; IS

864
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
THAT WHY THEY DO THIS?

865
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
>> YOU HAVE TO DOCUMENT IT,

866
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
BECAUSE IT IS WHAT YOU NEED TO

867
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
DO TO REALLY CREATE A HISTORY

868
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
OF THE INSTENT.

869
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
FOR LEGAL PURPOSES AND

870
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
CERTAINLY THERE COULD BE CIVIL

871
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
ACTIONS IF THERE IS NOT

872
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
CRIMINAL.
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS

873
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
SUSPECT WAS DESCRIBED AS

874
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
SOMEONE WHO MIGHT HAVE MENTAL

875
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
PROBLEMS AND INCAPACITY AS FAR

876
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
AS HIS MENTAL STATE HE COULD

877
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
HAVE BEEN FORMULATED BY

878
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
SOMEONE ELSE AND GUIDED AND

879
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
PROVIDED WITH INFORMATION AND

880
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
A CONSPIRACY, YOU KNOW.

881
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
IT IS REALLY WHAT I AM TALKING

882
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
ABOUT AND SOMEBODY COULD HAVE

883
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
PUT HIM UP AND GAVE HIM

884
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
INFORMATION AND COMPLETED THE

885
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
CONSPIRACY.
AND THEN YOU WOULD NEED TO

886
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
PROSECUTE THAT INDIVIDUAL.

887
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
SO IT NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE

888
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
THIS EARLY IN THE

889
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
INVESTIGATION, YOU COUNTY

890
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
DON'T KNOW -- WHAT YOU HAVE

891
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
EXCEPT FOR THE VICTIMS.

892
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
>> WE ARE GETTING A LITTLE BIT

893
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
OF AN IDEA WHO HE WAS.

894
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
AND THE NEW YORK TIMES AND

895
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
REPORTING ABOUT HOW SOCIALLY

896
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
ACWARD HE HIGH SCHOOL.

897
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
AND FEW FREPPEDS AND HE DIDN'T

898
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
CENTER A BOOK BOOK -- FACE

899
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
BOOK PAGE WE ARE GETTING A

900
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
GLIMPSE OF HIM TONIGHT .

901
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
BUT THE DETECTIVES.

902
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
THEY HAVE TO DIG DEEPER, ARE

903
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
THEY NOT?

904
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
>> THEY ARE GOING TO DIG

905
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
DEEPER FOR WEEKS AND MAYBE

906
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
LONGER THAN THAT.
THEY WILL DO AN AUTOPSY ON HIS

907
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
MIND AND HIS LIFE AS WELL AS

908
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
HIS BODY.
THEY ARE GOING TO FIGURE OUT

909
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
WHO HE WAS TALKING TO AND WHAT

910
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
HIGH WAS SAYING AND TALK TO

911
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND ANYBODY

912
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
ON THE COMPUTER AND WEB SITES

913
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
AND ANYTHING HE PUT OUT OR

914
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
WROTE.

915
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
ANYTHING THAT HE THREATENED.

916
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
THEY ARE GOING TO FIND OUT

917
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
JUST EXACTLY HOW MANY FLAGS

918
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
THERE WERE AND THAT IS REALLY

919
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
ONLY WAY TO GO BACK WARDS AND

920
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
TRY TO PREVENT AN INCIDENT IS

921
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
TO CONTROL THE INDIVIDUAL WITH

922
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
THE IDEA AND MOTIVATION TO DO

923
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
AS HEINOUS AS THIS.

924
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
NDO YOU EVER GET USED TO THE

925
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
INVESTIGATION .

926
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
20 CHILDREN.

927
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
THEY ARE LIKE FIVE OR 10 YEARS

928
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
OLD.

929
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
IT SEEMS LIKE THE WORST OF THE

930
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
WORST.

931
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
AND AS A DETECTIVE, DO YOU

932
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
EVER, CAN YOU DO THIS?

933
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
AND HOW DO YOU GO THROUGH

934
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
THYSELF THINGS?

935
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO

936
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
WAY THAT ANYBODY CAN PREPARE

937
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
THEMSELVES FOR A CHILD'S

938
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
HOMICIDE.
