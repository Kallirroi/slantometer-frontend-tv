1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
YOU WANT TO SEE IT, IT'S A BIG

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
THING.
BIG DEAL TONIGHT.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
SO CHECK IT OUT THERE.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
ALSO, WE WOULD LIKE FOR TO YOU

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
SPOUT OFF ABOUT THE FACTOR FROM

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
NAME AND TOWN IF YOU WISH TO

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
OPINE.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
WORD OF THE DAY, DO NOT BE A

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
MISCREANT.
WHO LOVES THAT WORD?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
DO KNOW BE A MISCREANT WHEN

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
WRITING TO THE FACTOR.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I AM BILL O'REILLY.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
PLEASE, ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THE

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
SPIN STOPS RIGHT HERE BECAUSE WE

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING OUT FOR

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
YOU.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
>> SEAN: THIS IS A FOX NEWS

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
ALER.
SUSAN RICE, THE U.S. AMBASSADOR

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
TO THE UNITED NATIONS WERE YOU

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
HER NAME FROM CONSIDERATION TO

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
BE THE NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
IN A LETTER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA,

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
RICE WROTE, QUOTE, I AM FULLY

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
CONFIDENT THAT I COULD SERVE OUR

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
COUNTRY ABLY AND EFFECTIVELY IN

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
THAT ROLE.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
HOWEVER, IF NOMINATED, I AM NOW

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
CONVINCED THAT THE CONFIRMATION

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
PROCESS WOULD BE LEATH --

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
LENGTHY, DISRUPTIVE AND COSTLY

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
TO YOU AND OUR MOST PRESSING

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
PRIORITIES AND THAT IS NOT WORTH

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
IT TO OUR COUNTRY.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
THIS COMES IN THE WAKE OF

38
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS, EXPRESSING

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
OPPOSITION TO HER POTENTIAL

40
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
NOMINATION BECAUSE OF COMMENTS

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
SHOW MADE FIVE DAYS AFTER FOUR

42
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
AMERICANS WERE KILLED IN A

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
BLATANT TERRORIST ATTACK IN

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
BENGHAZI IN SEPTEMBER.

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
AMBASSADOR RICE BLAMED ALL THE

46
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
VIOLENCE ON A youtube VIDEO,

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
WHEN ALL THE EVIDENCE SHOWED

48
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT TROUGH.

49
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA RESPONDED TO THE

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
LETTER EARLIER TODAY AND SAID

51
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
THE ATTACKS ON AMBASSADOR RICE

52
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
IN RECENT WEEKS HAVE BEEN BOTH

53
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
UNFAIR AND MISLEADING.

54
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
BUT GET THIS, IN TYPICAL

55
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
FASHION, NBC NEWS JUMPED IN TO

56
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
RICE'S DEFENSE AND CONTINUED

57
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
THEIR FALSE NARRATIVE THAT ANY

58
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
CRITICISM OF HER IS NOT ROOTED

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
IN HER FALSE TESTIMONY, BUT

60
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
RACISM, OTHER DOG WHISTLE.

61
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
WATCH THIS.
>> I THINK THAT THIS HAD BECOME

62
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
SORT OF AN IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGE

63
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
FOR HER TO BE CONFIRMED, THAT

64
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
SHE REALIZED THAT, THE WHITE

65
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
HOUSE REALIZED IT AS WELL.

66
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I THINK THEY KNOW THEY ARE ON

67
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
GOOD POLITICAL, SOLID GROUND, AS

68
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
YOU WERE POINTING OUT.

69
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
THIS IS NOT GOING TO HELP

70
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
REPUBLICANS AT ALL, THE FACT

71
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
THAT A WOMAN AND A WOMAN OF

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
COLOR HAS BEEN FORCED OUT OF A

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
CONFIRMATION PROCESS BEFORE SHE

74
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
WAS NOMINATED.

75
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
JOINING ME WITH REACTION, FORMER

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, NEWT

77
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
GINGRICH.
>> I AM DOING VERY WELL.

78
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I COULDN'T HELP BUT SMILE AT THE

79
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
ABSURDITY.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DID

80
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
NOMINATE COLIN POWELL, WHO

81
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
BECAME THE SECRETARY OF STATE.

82
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
THEY DID NOMINATE CONDOLEEZZA

83
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
RICE, WHO BECAME SECRETARY OF

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
STATE.

85
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
IT WOULD BE HARD TO SAY THAT THE

86
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
SENATOR WHO IS HAD PROBLEMS WERE

87
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
DOING SO FOR EITHER RACIAL OR

88
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
SEXUAL REASONS.

89
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
THEY HAVE PROVEN THE WILLINGNESS

90
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
TO WORK WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS

91
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
OF BOTH MALE AND FEMALE.

92
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I THINK IT WOULD NOT BE A BAD

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
IDEA FOR PRESIDENT OBOTTOMING --

94
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
OBAMA TO SEE IF COLIN POWELL

95
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
WOULD COME OUT OF RETIREMENT AND

96
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
THAT MIB A BIPARTISAN STEP TO

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
MOVE US IN A DIRECTION OF A

98
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
DIFFERENT KIND OF DIALOGUE THAT

99
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
WE ARE GOING TO GET, IF WE STAY

100
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
WITH LEFT-WING POLICIES?

101
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
IT'S INTERESTING.

102
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
THE EVIDENCE WAS OVERWHELMING.

103
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
IT WAS INCONVERTIBLE IN THIS

104
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
PARTICULAR CASE, BUT

105
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
DEMOCRATS -- THE CAMPAIGN NEVER

106
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
STOPS.
THERE IS NO TIME FOR GOVERNING

107
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
HERE, WHATSOEVER.

108
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
IT SEEMS THAT THEY WANT TO

109
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
HUMILIATE, CRUSH, DIVIDE AND

110
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
HURT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

111
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
AM I WRONG, AS I OBSERVE THE

112
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
FISCAL CLIFF AND THE ATTACKS

113
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THAT NEVER END -- WAR ON WOMEN,

114
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
NEVER ENDS?
>> YOU KNOW, I WAS A BIG FAN AND

115
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
VERY, VERY IMPRESSED WITH COACH

116
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
WOOTEN'S USE OF THE FULL-COURT

117
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
PRESS AT UCLA.

118
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE

119
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
BASKETBALL DINE SEE -- DYNASTIEN

120
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
HISTORY, IF YOU ARE RUNNING

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
AGAINST A FULL-COURT PRESS, YOU

122
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
BETTER RUN AGAINST THE

123
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
FULL-COURT PRESS.
A CHICAGO-STYLE MACHINE IS

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
TRYING TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT

125
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
24-HOUR-A-DAY, 365-DAY-A-YEAR

126
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
CAMPAIGN.
WE BETTER LEARN HOW IT COPE WITH

127
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
AND HOW TO BE INVOLVED WITH IT.

128
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
THE FACT IS, IN THE CASE OF

129
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
AMBASSADOR RICE, SHE IS THE

130
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
PERSON WHO HAS A GRIEVANCE WITH

131
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
THE PRESIDENT.

132
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
SHE WAS SENT OUT BY THE

133
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
PRESIDENT TO SAY THINGS THAT

134
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
WERE FALSE.

135
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
SHE WAS USED FOR FIVE SHOWS IN

136
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
ONE SUNDAY TO TELL THE AMERICAN

137
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
PEOPLE SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT

138
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
TRUE.

139
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
AND I THINK IF SHE HAS A
COMPLAINT WITH ANYBODY, IT OUGHT

140
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
TO BE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO

141
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
SENT HER OUT THERE, USING HER

142
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
POLITICALLY, EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS

143
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
THE U.N. AMBASSADOR.

144
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
>> SEAN: YOU ALWAYS HAVE AN

145
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
INTERESTING TAKE ON THE EVENTS

146
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
OF THE DAY.
WE HAVE ALL OF THESE INCIDENCE

147
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
OF VIOLENCE -- UP ON, WE SEE THE

148
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
LEFT AND THE G-8 AND G-20

149
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
SUMMITS.
WE SEE STEVEN CROWDER, PUNCHED

150
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
IN THE FACE, A TENT KNOCKED

151
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
DOWN.
I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON ALL

152
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
OF THIS BECAUSE THE SILENCE FROM

153
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
PRESIDENT CIVILITY IS DEAFENING

154
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE HIS ALLIES

155
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
AFTER ALL.

156
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
HE HAS SOME SWAY WITH STHEM.

157
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
>> IN A NUMBER OF CASES,

158
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
PARTICULARLY WITH THE THREATS OF

159
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
VIOLENCE IN MICHIGAN, I WOULD

160
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
HOPE THAT THE GOVERNOR OF

161
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
MICHIGAN WOULD CALL ON THE

162
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
PRESIDENT TO ASK HIS ALLIES TO

163
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
BEHAVE IN A CIVIL AND DECENT

164
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
MATTER.
THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR

165
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
PEOPLE THREATENING VIOLENCE.

166
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I THINK ONE OF THE STATE

167
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
SENATORS IN MICHIGAN SAID THAT

168
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
THERE WILL BE BLOOD.
WHAT KIND OF COMMENT IS THAT

169
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
FROM AN ELECTED OFFICIAL?

170
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
WHY IS IT BEING TOLERATED?

171
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I THINK THE NETWORKS AND THE NEW

172
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
YORK TIMES AND OTHERS HAVE A

173
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
REAL OBLIGATION TO COVER UNION

174
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
VIOLENCE WHEN IT OCCURS AND NOT

175
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
HIDE IT.

176
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
SO I THINK YOU ARE RAISING A

177
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
GOOD POINT AND IT'S ONE THAT WE

178
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
SHOULD BE ADDRESSING AND

179
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
DEMANDING THAT THE PRESIDENT
CALL ON HIS ALLIES TO EXERCISE

180
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
DISCIPLINE AND CIVILITY.

181
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
>> SEAN: ALL RIGHT.

182
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
DO YOU REMEMBER DURING THE TEA

183
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
PARTY RALLIES, YOU WERE SPEAKING

184
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
ABOUT THE MEDIA.
THE MEDIA WOULD SEARCH HIGH AND

185
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
LOW AND THEY WOULD BE LOOKING

186
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
FOR...

187
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
SOMETHING NEGATIVE THAT THE TEA

188
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
PARTY MOVEMENT WAS SAYING,

189
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
USUALLY, THEY WERE KIDS ON THEIR

190
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
DAD'S SHOULDERS AND PATRIOTIC

191
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
SPEECHES, SINGING THE PLEDGE OF

192
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
ALLEGIANCE AND LEAVE THE PLACE

193
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
CLEANER THAN WHEN THEY FOUND IT.

194
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I ASK YOU THROUGH THIS PRISM, AS

195
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
WE COMPARE THIS TO THE TEA

196
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
PARTY, NOW, THERE WAS A VENDOR

197
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
IN THE TENT, A HOTDOG GUY, BEEN

198
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
WORKING THERE FOR 16 YEARS.

199
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I INTERVIEWED THIS MAN ON MY

200
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
RADIO PROGRAM.
THEY RUINEDDED HIS EQUIPMENT AND

201
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
KNOCKED OVER HIS FOOD.

202
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
>> THEY TRAMPLED THE TENT AND

203
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
EVERYTHING I HAD.

204
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
THEY WERE UNDER THE TENT,

205
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
TABLES, HOTDOG, HOTDOG BUNS,

206
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
HOTDOGS, CHILI, ALL OF MY

207
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
UTENSILS AND THEN THEY WERE

208
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
SAYING, OKAY, MAKE A CHILI DOG

209
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
NOW.

210
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
EVERYTHING'S ON THE GROUND.

211
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
THEY CALLED ME THE "N" WORD --

212
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
>> WAIT.

213
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
THEY CALLED ME -- YOU ON THE

214
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
WRONG SIDE.
I EXPLAINED TO THEM, SEAN, THAT

215
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I WAS THERE TO DO A JOB,

216
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
PROSPERITY HIRED ME TO DO A JOB.

217
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
THAT'S WHY I WAS THERE.

218
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I AM NOT HERE AND I AM NOT ON

219
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
THAT SIDE.
I AM JUST HERE.

220
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
SO IT REALLY DIDN'T MAKE A

221
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
DIFFERENCE TO THOSE GUYS?

222
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
>> YOU WERE HIRED TO DO A JOB,

223
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
SO THEY PURPOSELY STARTED

224
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
DESTROYING YOUR EQUIPMENT,

225
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
CALLING YOU THE "N" WORD AND

226
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
UNGLE TOM?
>> THEY DIDN'T CARE.

227
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
THEY DIDN'T CARE.

228
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
>> SEAN: THE MEDIA DIDN'T COVER

229
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
THE VIOLENCE.

230
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
IF THIS WAS A TEA PARTY RALLY,

231
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
WHAT WOULD THE REACTION BE IN

232
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
THE MEDIA?

233
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT IT WOULD

234
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
BE.

235
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
THIS IS PART OF THE TOTAL BIAS

236
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
OF THE MODERN MEDIA IN

237
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
PROTECTING THE LEFT EVERY WAY IT

238
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
CAN.

239
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I WOULD HOPE THAT A COUPLE OF

240
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
CONSERVATIVE LAWYERS LISTENING

241
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
TO THAT ON YOUR RADIO SHOW WOULD

242
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
OFFER TO REPRESENT HIM PRO BONO

243
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
AND FILE A SUIT FOR DAMAGES

244
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
AGAINST THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE I

245
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
SUSPECT THERE ARE PICTURES OF

246
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
WHO THEY ARE.

247
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I SUSPECT THEY'RE VULNERABLE TO

248
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
BEING SUED.
I THINK WE NEED TO LEARN TO USE

249
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
THE LEFT'S OWN TECHNIQUES

250
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
AGAINST THEM.

251
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
BUT WE HAVE TO BE MUCH MORE

252
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
AGGRESSIVE, IN RAISING THE ISSUE

253
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
OF VIOLENCE ON THE LEFT AND IN

254
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
DEMANDING THAT IT WOULD BE

255
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
POLICED, THE PEOPLE WOULD BE

256
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
ARRESTED WHEN NECESSARY AND THAT

257
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY

258
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
HERE AND CALLING ON HIS OWN

259
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
ALLIES TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT AND

260
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
TO BE DISCIPLINED AND RECOGNIZE

261
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
THE RULE OF LAW.

262
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
>> SEAN: HOW DO YOU INTERPRET UP

263
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
ON, THIS LABOR VIOLENCE, THE

264
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
G-20 SUMMIT.

265
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
HOW DO YOU INTERPRET THAT,

266
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
COMING FROM THE LEFT?

267
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
AND THE LANGUAGE OF THE LEFT,

268
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
WHICH NEITHER -- NEITHER YOU OR

269
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I WOULD EVER GET AWAY WITH.

270
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
>> I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE IS

271
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
A MOVEMENT ON OFFENSE WHICH IS

272
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
DESPERATELY TRYING TO CHANGE

273
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
AMERICA AND TRIES TO BROWBEAT

274
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
AND RIDICULE AND INTIMIDATE THE

ANTI-DEMOCRATIC OPPRESSION BY

277
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
VERY MILITANT, SMALL GROUPS.

278
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I THINK WE HAVE TO PROVE THAT WE

279
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
ARE PREPARED WHEN NECESSARIES TO

280
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
USE THE POLICE, WE ARE PREPARED

281
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
WHEN NECESSARY TO FILE LAWSUITS.

282
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
AND WE ARE NOT -- WE ARE GOING

283
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
TO GO AFTER THEM.

284
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
>> SEAN: THESE ARE TWO BIG

285
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
LOSSES FOR THE PRESIDENT.

286

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
UNION LEADERSHIP.

295
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000

298
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
SUSAN RICE, THE PRESIDENT TRIED

299
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
TO STAND UP FOR HER AND THAT

300
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
DIDN'T WORK EITHER.
THIS SHWE INTERPRET THAT AS IT

301
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
RELATES TO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE

302

PRESIDENT?

303
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
>> WELL, LOOK, I THINK THE

304
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
NEGOTIATIONS ARE SOMETHING TO

305
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
TALK ABOUT.

306
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
BUT WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THE

NATURAL BALANCE OF THINGS.

308
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WON A VICTORY.

309
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
IT WAS A BIG VICTORY, AN

310
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
IMPRESSIVE VICTORY.

311
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I DIDN'T THINK HE COULD DO IT.

312
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000

313
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000

HERE'S WHY.

408
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
IN RECENT DAYS, HIS COMPANY,

409
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000

410
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
NOT EXACTLY PAYING THEIR FAIR

411
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
SHARE.
SCHMITT, AT THE HELM OF THE

412
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
COMPANY WHEN ACCORDING TO A

413
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
REPORT BY BLOOMBERG NEWS, GOOGLE

414
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
AVOIDED $2 BILLION IN WORLDWIDE

415
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
INCOME TAXES IN 2011, SHIFTING

416
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
$9.8 MILLION IN REVENUES INTO A

DOUBLE THE TOTAL FROM YEARS

BEFORE.

420
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
WHILE THE REPORT NOTES THAT THE

421
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
MONEY WAS MOVED LEGALLY, THIS

422
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
SEAM SEEMS LIKE A DIRECT

423
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
CONTRADICTION TO PRESIDENT

424
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
OBAMA'S NON-STOP LECTURES ABOUT

425
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
CORPORATE GREED AND PAYING YOUR

426
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
FAIR SHARE.

427
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
MR. SCHMITT HAS SAID, HE'S PROUD

428
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
OF HIS TAX MOVES.

429
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
MORE INTERESTING, HE WAS RUMORED

430
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
TO BE AT THE TOP OF THE

431
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
PRESIDENT'S CABINET RECRUITING

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
CLASS FOR A SECOND TERM.

433
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
THOUGH HE PREEMPTIVELY DECLINED

434
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
AN OFFER, POSSIBLE POSITIONS

435
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
WERE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY,

436
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
EVEN THE SECRETARY OF

BUSINESSES.

438
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
HERE WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT'S

439
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
BILLIONAIRE BUDDY AT GOOGLE,

440
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
HELPING TO SHELTER HIS COMPANY'S

441
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
MONEY IN A SHELL COMPANY IN

442
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
BERMUDA TO AVOID PAYING HIS FAIR

443
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
SHARE AND HE IS BEING CONSIDERED

444
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
FOR A CABINET POST.

445
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
JOINING ME IS FORMER SPEAKER OF

446
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
THE HOUSE NEWT GINGRICH AND

447
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE NEWT
GINGRICH.

448
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
AND WARREN BUFFETT, FORBES

449
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
MAGAZINE HAS A PIECE ABOUT

450
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
HIM -- MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF TAX

451
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
DOLLARS HE IS NOT PAYING BECAUSE

452
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
HE IS USING EVERY LOOPHOLE

453
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
IMAGINABLE, NOT TO PAY.

454
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
A LITTLE IRONIC.

455
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
>> I THINK THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS

456
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
OUGHT TO PASS THE GOOGLE/BUFFETT

457
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
TAX BILL, PROVIDING THAT EVERY

458
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO

459
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
AT LEAST AS MANY DEDUCTIONS AND

460
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
LOOPHOLES AS WARREN BUFFETT AND

461
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
ERIC SCHMITT.

462
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
WE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

463
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
LIBERALS BEING HUMAN AND TRYING

464
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND SIMPLY

465
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
SUGGEST THAT EVERYBODY ELSE

466
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
OUGHT TO BE THE SAME RIGHT.

467
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE PART

468
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
OF OF OUR ANSWER TO PRESIDENT

469
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
OBAMA'S CONSTANT DEMAND FOR

470
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
HIGHER TAXES.
THESE ARE HIS ALLIES, DOING WHAT

471
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
THEY -- IT IS LEGAL.

472
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
AND SO WE SHOULD TRY TO EXTEND

473
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
THAT LEGALITY TO THE MIDDLE

474
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
CLASS.
I THINK -- IT WOULD BE VERY

475
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
EDUCATIONAL TO SUDDENLY CALL A

476
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
HEARING AND ASK PEOPLE LIKE

477
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
WARREN BUFFETT TO COME IN AND

478
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
EDUCATE THE WHOLE COUNTRY ON HOW

479
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
THE MIDDLE CLASS COULD USE EVERY

480
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
LOOPHOLE TO AVOID PAYING TAXES.

481
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
>> SEAN: THIS WAS ON NATIONAL

482
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
REVIEW ONLINE, 36 OF PRESIDENT

483
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE STAFF

484
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
OWE $$830,000 IN BACK TAXES.

485
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
WHY DO I THINK IF IT WAS YOU OR

486
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
ME -- MADE A MODEL CITIZEN

487
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
BEFORE THE NATION -- I THINK

488
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
THERE WOULD BE A DOUBLE STANDARD

489
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
IN HANDLING SOME OF THAT.

490
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
>> WELL, THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL

491
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
PART OF THE CONSERVATIVE

492
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
ARGUMENT ABOUT BIG GOVERNMENT.

493
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
BIG GOVERNMENT'S INHERENTLY

494
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
UNFAIR T. INHERENTLY HAS

495
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
ADVANTAGES FOR FRIENDS AND

496
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
INHERENTLY TAKES CARE OF

497
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
INSIDERS, CREATING A SYSTEM,

498
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE

499
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
RULE OF LAW AND THE OPPOSITE OF

500
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
A FREE SOCIETY.

501
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
THAT'S WHY CONSERVATIVES HAVE

502
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
ARGUED FOR SMALLER GOVERNMENT

503
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
BECAUSE THESE THINGS ARE ALMOST

504
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
INEVITABLE BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO

505
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
HAVE POWER TAKE CARE OF

506
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
THEMSELVES AND THEY TAKE CARE OF

507
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
THEIR FRIENDS?

508
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
>> SEAN: I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR

509
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
THE HOUSE LEADERSHIP, THERE HAS

510
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
BEEN A LOT OF FIGHTING, TEA

511
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
PARTY CONSERVATIVES SAY THEY

512
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
HAVE BEEN PURGED FROM THEIR

513
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
COMMITTEES AND THE NEGOTIATE --

514
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE

515
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
PRESIDENT -- YOUR ADVICE WAS,

516
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
PASS A SERIES OF BILLS.

517
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET.

518
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE TIME TO

519
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
DO THAT?
>> SURE, THEY HAVE TIME TO DO

520
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
IT.

521
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN CAUGHT UP IN,

522
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I BEING, A LOSING PROPOSITION.

523
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET A REAL

524
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
AGREEMENT OUT OF BARACK OBAMA

525
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.

526
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
HE JUST WON AN ELECTION.

527
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
HE IS FEELING LIKE HE IS

528
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
DOMINANT WHARKTS JAPANESE USED

529
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
TO CALL VICTORY DISEASE.

530
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
HE IS MAKING OUTLANDISH

531
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
SUGGESTIONS, SUCH AS ELIMINATING

532
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
THE DEBT CEILING PERMANENTLY, SO

533
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
THE PRESIDENT COULD RUN UP ANY

534
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
LEVEL OF DEFICIT THAT HE WANTS

535
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
TO.

536
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR THE

537
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
HOUSE TO PASS, I WOULD PASS TWO

538
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
BILLS, A COMPLETE EXTENSION OF

539
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
EVERY SINGLE TAX CUT AND PASS AN

540
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
EXTENSION OF EVERY PASS CUT

541
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
EXCEPT THE TOP.

542
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
PASS BOTH OF THEM.

543
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
SEND THEM TO THE SENATE AND SAY,

544
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
WE ARE NOT DEALING WITH ANYTHING

545
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
ELSE.
WE ARE NOT PLAYING GAMES.

546
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE MIDDLE

547
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
CLASS DOESN'T FACE A TAX

548
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
INCREASE.
YOU PICK.

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
THEY ARE BULLDOZING ENTIRE

732
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE HALF THE

733
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
POPULATION'S GONE, TO

734
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
CONSOLIDATE SERVICES.
THEY LOST ALL OF THOSE CAR

735
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
MANUFACTURING JOBS, THE UNIONS

736
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
PARTLY RESPONSIBLE?

737
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
LEADERSHIP?

738
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
>> THE AUTO INDUSTRY IS NOT THE

739
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
ENVY OF THE WORLD.

740
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I LOVE THIS COUNTRY -- I WISH IT

741
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
WERE.

742
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
WE HAVE -- LOOK, A LOT OF GREAT

743
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
PEOPLE IN UNION, I WORKED IN A

744
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
UNION FACTORY IN COLLEGE.

745
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I CAN TELL YOU, BECAUSE YOU ARE

746
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
UNION, IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE A

747
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
BAD EMPLOYEE.

748
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
BUT MANY MIDE YOKER EMPLOYEES

749
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
ARE PROTECTED BY THE UNIONS AND

750
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
THIS HURTS UNIONS.

751
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
THERE IS A REASON, DETROIT, ONE

752
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
OF THE BIRTH PLACES OF THE LABOR

753
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
UNION BECAME A RIGHT-TO-WORK

754
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
STATE -- BECAUSE OF NONSENSE

755
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
LIKE THIS.

756
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
IT IS SELF-DISCREDITING, TO

757
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
PROTECT PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING

758
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
WITH HEAVY MACHINERY, GETTING

759
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
HIGH ON THEIR BRAKE BREAKS.

760
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
>> EVEN IF YOU ACCEPT THAT

761
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
REASONING -- WHICH I DON'T -

762
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
EVEN IF YOU ACCEPT THAT

763
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
REASONING, IT ISN'T THAT THE

764
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
SITUATION IN DETROIT IS GOING TO

765
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
LEAD TO THE DECLINE OF AMERICAN

766
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
CITIES?

767
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
>> WHY CAN'T YOU LOOK AT

768
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
SOMETHING AS BASIC AS THAT SAY

769
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
YOU HAVE TO FIRE THOSE GUYS.

770
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
THEY DON'T REFLECT EVERY WORKER.

771
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
AS A MATTER OF FACT, GOOD

772
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
WORKERS, THEIR NAME AND

773
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
REPUTATION IS HURT BECAUSE OF

774
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
SCENES LIKE THIS AND PEOPLE

775
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
SEEING THIS.
>> I AM SAYING OWNERSHIP, THE

776
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
MANAGEMENT AND THE OWNERSHIP

777
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
ENTERED INTO INTO AN AGREEMENT

778
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
WITH THE WORKERS AND SET UP A

779
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
PROCESS, IT DIDN'T WORK OUT--

780
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
>>> BUT WHY ARE THERE ALL OF

781
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
THESE -- TO TUCKER, LOOK AT

782
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
MISSISSIPPI AND TENNESSEE AND

783
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
ALABAMA.
ALL OF THESE STATES, GUESS WHAT?

784
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
NOW THEY ARE BUILDING CARS --

785
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
>> OF COURSE, THEY ARE.

786
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
>> SEAN: AND IN INDIA AND OTHER

787
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
COUNTRIES.

788
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
>> UNIONS DON'T HELP -- SOME

789
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
UNIONS DO -- A LOT OF UNIONS

790
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
HAVE SOLD OUT THEIR OWN WORKERS.

791
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
YOU SEE DEPRESSED WAGES BECAUSE

792
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
OF LOW-SKILL IMMIGRATION,

793
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
SUPPORTED BY THE UNIONS, FOR

794
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
REASONS THAT ARE NOT CLEAR AT

795
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
ALL.

796
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
AT THE BEHEST OF THE DEMOCRATIC

797
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
PARTY, FOR WHICH THEY ARE THE

798
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
MOST FAITHFUL GET-OUT-THE VOTES.

799
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
TRULY--
>>> NOW, WE HAVE THIS VIOLENCE

800
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
TAKE PLACE, YOU SAW THE VIDEO

801
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
AND IF IT WAS A TEA PARTY

802
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
MEMBER, I TALKED TO THE HOTDOG

803
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
GUY, WHO WILL BE ON GRETA LATER

804
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
TONIGHT -- AND I JUST PLAYED HIM

805
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
WITH NEWT GINGRICH, USING THE

806
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
"N" WORD -- THE "N" WORD WAS USE

807
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
THE AGAINST HIM.

808
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
HE WAS CALLED AN UNCLE TOM.

809
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
HIS EQUIPMENT WAS RUINED.

810
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
HIS FOOD WAS KNOCKED OVER.

811
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
IF THIS HAPPENED IN A TEA PARTY

812
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
RALLY, NOT A LABOR RALLY, IT

813
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
WOULD BE FRONT-PAGE NEWS AND THE

814
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
LEFT WOULD BE HAVING A FIT.

815
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN, UP ON

816
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
VIOLENCE?

817
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
G-20 SUMMIT, VIOLENCE.

818
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
LABOR MOVEMENT, VIOLENCE THIS

819
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
WEEK.

820
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
NO PROMINENT LIBERAL SPEAKS OUT.

821
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
>> I AM A PRODUCT OF THE SOCIAL

822
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
JUSTICE MOVEMENT FOR CIVIL

823
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
RIGHTS, A NONVIOLENT MOVEMENT

824
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
YOU?
>> ARE RIGHT.

825
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
>> THOSE WHO CAME OUT FOR

826
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
NONVIOLENCE, VIOLENCE WAS

827
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
VISITED UPON THEM.

828
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
THEY HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO PAY

829
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
THE CONSEQUENCES FOR BEING

830
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
NONVIOLENT.
WHEN PEOPLE BREAK THE LAW, THEY

831
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
HAVE TO GO TO JAIL.

832
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
WHETHER THE MEDIA--

833
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
>>> BUT IF A TEA PARTY MEMBER

834
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
USED THE "N" WORD AGAIN A GUY--

835
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
THE BIG LABOR -- NO REPORTS ON

836
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
ANY MAJOR NETWORKS.

837
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
>> I AM NOT FOR IT UNDER ANY

838
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
CIRCUMSTANCES.

839
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I NEVER CONDONE THE "N" WORD--

840
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
>>> RUINED HIS EQUIPMENT.

841
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
>> BUT THE OTHER THICK THAT WAS

842
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
MENTIONED THAT HAS TO BE

843
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
RESPONDED TO, THE ROLE OF UNIONS

844
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
IN CIVIL RIGHT, CHILD LABOR LAW,

845
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
WORKPLACE SAFETY AND OVER--

846
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
>>> LAST QUESTION -- IS IT WRONG

847
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
TO SAY TO PEOPLE, YOU CAN'T WORK

848
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
UNLESS YOU JOIN THE UNION, PAY

849
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
DUES AND THAT MONEY IS USED FOR

850
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
POLITICAL --
>> IF IT GOES THROUGH THE

851
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND IS PASSED

852
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
BY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND THE

853
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000

IN AMERICA WHO, HAVE BEEN IN

862
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
EVERY INSTANCE, WHEN THERE ISN'T

863
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000

STILL AHEAD, MEDIA MASH.

867
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
WE COUNT THE MANY WAYS THAT THE

868
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
MEDIA BIAS IS ON DISPLAY.

869
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
ALSO, HARRY BELLE FOBTY -- HARRY

870
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
BELAFONTE IS LAUNCHING IDIOTIC

OBAMA ADVICE.

873
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT THE

874
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
ESPN ANALYSTS ARE SAYING ABOUT

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000

WE HAVE THE TAPE, COMING UP.

00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

879
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
COPD INCLUDES CHRONIC
BRONCHITIS AND EMPHYSEMA.

880
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
SPIRIVA HELPS CONTROL
MY COPD SYMPTOMS

881
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
BY KEEPING MY AIRWAYS

882
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
OPEN FOR 24 HOURS.

883
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
PLUS, IT REDUCES COPD FLARE-UPS.

884
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
SPIRIVA IS THE ONLY ONCE-DAILY

885
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
INHALED COPD MAINTENANCE
TREATMENT THAT DOES BOTH.

886
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
SPIRIVA HANDIHALER TIOTROPIUM
BROMIDE INHALATION POWDER

887
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
DOES NOT REPLACE FAST-ACTING
INHALERS FOR SUDDEN SYMPTOMS.

888
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU HAVE
KIDNEY PROBLEMS, GLAUCOMA,

889
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
TROUBLE URINATING, OR
AN ENLARGED PROSTATE.

890
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
THESE MAY WORSEN WITH SPIRIVA.

891
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
DISCUSS ALL MEDICINES
YOU TAKE, EVEN EYE DROPS.

892
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
STOP TAKING SPIRIVA AND SEEK
IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP

893
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
IF YOUR BREATHING
SUDDENLY WORSENS,

894
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
YOUR THROAT OR TONGUE
SWELLS, YOU GET HIVES,

895
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
VISION CHANGES OR EYE PAIN,
OR PROBLEMS PASSING URINE.

896
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
DRY MOUTH AND CONSTIPATION.

897
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
NOTHING CAN REVERSE COPD

898
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
SPIRIVA HELPS ME BREATHE BETTER.

899
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
(BLOWING SOU)

900
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT SPIRIVA.

all.

912
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
>> SEAN: WELCOME BACK TO

913
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
"HANNITY."

914
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
EVEN THOUGH 50 MILLION AMERICANS
VOTED AGAINST PRESIDENT OBAMA,

915
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
HIS SUPPORTERS CANNOT SEEM TO

916
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
COMPREHEND WHY HE IS RECEIVING

917
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
SUCH OPPOSITION TO HIS RADICAL

918
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
AGEND A. HARRY BELAFONTE HAS

919
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
DOWNRIGHT DISTURBING ADVICE, HOW

920
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
OBAMGA SHOULD DEAL WITH THE

921
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
SENATORS.
HE WAS ASKED ABOUT REPUBLICANS

922
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
PUSHING REFORM TO THE COUNT RE'S

923
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
BROKEN ENTITLEMENT SYSTEM.

924
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS IS WHAT

925
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
HE SAID.

926
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
>> PLENTY OF AMERICAN PEOPLE IN

927
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
THEIR MATURITY DECLARED FULLY,

928
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
WE WANT WHAT BARACK OBAMA IS

929
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
TALKING ABOUT.
WE WANT OUR COUNTRY TO GO IN

930
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
THAT DIRECTION.

931
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
WHAT FASCINATES ME IS IN THE

932
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
FACE OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS

933
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
EXPRESSING THEIR DESIRE, THE

934
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
WHOLE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT

935
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
DEFINING ITS GAME THAT THERE

936
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
SHOULD BE THIS LINGERING

937
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
INFESTATION OF REALLY CORRUPT

938
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
PEOPLE WHO SIT TRYING TO

939
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
DISMANTLE THE WISHES OF THE

940
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
PEOPLE, THE MANDATE THAT HAS

941
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
BEEN GIVEN TO BARACK OBAMA AND I

942
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE THEY WANT.

943
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR BARACK

944
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
OBAMA TO DO IS TO WORK AND

945
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
DICTATE TO THE WORLD AND THROW

946
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
ALL OF THESE GUYS IN JAIL.

947
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
THEY ARE VIOLATING THE AMERICAN

948
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
DESIRE.

949
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
>> SEAN: YEAH, THROW 'EM IN

950
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
JAIL.
PRESIDENT OBOTTOM AACT LIKE A

951
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
DICTATOR.
JOINING ME WITH THE REACTION,

952
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE AND TARA

953
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
DOWDELL IS HERE.

954
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
THIS IS THE SAME BELAFONTE WHO

955
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
SAID OF NELSON MANDELA.

956
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
WE SALUTE YOU.
WE WANT TO SEE YOU AND YOUR

957
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
FELLOW POLITICAL PRISONERS

958
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
FREED.
REACTION?

959
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
>> WELL, I THINK THAT HARRY

960
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
BELAFONTE WAS SAYING HAD HE SAID

961
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
IN JEST--
>>> IN JEST?

962
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
>> HE WAS JOKING AROUND.

963
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
HE DIDN'T MEAN IT--

964
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
>>> I HAVE A WHOLE LIST OF

965
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
THINGS HE SAID IN JEST.

966
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
>> YOU HAVE THE LIST OF HIM

967
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
CRITICIZING PRESIDENT OBAMA,

968
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
WHICH HE DID.

969
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
>> SEAN: COMPARING THE

970
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
ROSENBERGS TO POLITICAL

971
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
PRISONERS AND THE BUSH

972
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
ADMINISTRATION AND THE DHS TO

973
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
THE GASTOPO AND --

974
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
>> HE CRITICIZED OBAMA TOO AND

975
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
JAY-Z.

976
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
>> SEAN: COP KILLER -- I MEAN,

977
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
HOW EXTREME CAN YOU GET?

978
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
>> WELL, I THINK--

979
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
>>> YOU DON'T SEEM FAZED AT ALL.

980
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
>> HE WAS SAYING IT IN JEST--

981
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
>>> EVERY DUMB THING --

982
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
>> EVERYBODY STARTED LAUGHING--

983
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
>>> I SAY DUMB THINGS IN JEST,

984
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
PEOPLE START CAMPAIGNS TO STOP

985
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
ME.
>> THEY DO.

986
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
BECAUSE THEY KNOW YOU ARE NOT

987
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
KIDDING.

988
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
HE IS PREPARING FOR A ROLE.

989
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
THIS IS A SCRIPT HAIS

990
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
UNBELIEVABLE.

991
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
WHEN HE WAS CRITICIZING

992
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA IT'S BECAUSE HE

993
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
WASN'T CHOVEZ ENOUGH -- IT

994
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
WASN'T FAR SOCIALIST OR LIBERAL

995
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
ENOUGH.
HE IS QUITE SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT

996
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
HE IS SAYING.

997
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
THIS IS THE DIRECTION THAT HE

998
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
BELIEVES THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE

999
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
GOING.
HE SEEMS TO DESCRIBE A PLURALITY

1000
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
THAT DIDN'T WANT PRESIDENT OBAMA

1001
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
TO BE RE-ELECTED AND OUTRIGHT

1002
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
REJECTED HIS LIBERAL AGENDA.

1003
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
BUT THAT SEEMS TO HAVE FALLEN ON

1004
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
DEAF EARS OR HARRY BELAFONTE'S

1005
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
NOT LISTENING.

1006
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
>> SEAN: DO YOU LIKE RG3 AS MUCH

1007
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
AS I DO?

1008
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I AM A JETS FAN.

1009
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
SO HE WAS IMPRESSED WITH HIM, AS

1010
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
A PERSON?
>> RIGHT,.

1011
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
>> SEAN: AS AN INDIVIDUAL, ISN'T

1012
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
HE AMAZING?

1013
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
>> HE IS.

1014
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
>> SEAN: HE WAS ONCE ASKED ABOUT

1015
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
WHO HE FEARS, HE SAID GOD.

1016
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I FEAR GOD.

1017
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
>> GOOD ANSWER.

1018
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
>> SEAN: GOOD PERSON.

1019
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
GOOD HEART.

1020
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
GOOD SOUL.
HERE'S WHAT ESPN --

1021
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
>> THIS IS TERRIBLE.

1022
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
>> SEAN: THIS ANALYST HAD TO SAY

1023
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
ABOUT HIM.

1024
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
ROB PARKER.

1025
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
LISTEN TO THIS.

1026
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
>> MY QUESTION, WHICH IS JUST A

1027
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
STRAIGHT, HONEST QUESTION, IS HE

1028
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
A CORN BALL BROTHER --

1029
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1030
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
>> YEAH, EXPLAIN THAT.

1031
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
>> HE'S NOT REALLY.

1032
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
>> HE'S BLACK.

1033
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
BUT HE IS NOT DOWN WITH THE

1034
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
CAUSE.
HE IS NOT ONE OF US.

1035
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
HE IS KINDA BLACK.

1036
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
BUT HE'S NOT REALLY THE GUY YOU

1037
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
WANT TO HANG OUT WITH --

1038
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
>> WHY IS THAT YOUR QUESTION?

1039
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
>> BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I WANT TO

1040
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
FIND OUT ABOUT HIM.

1041
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I KEEP

1042
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
HEARING THESE THINGS.

1043
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
HE HAS A WHITE FIANCEE AND ALL

1044
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
OF THIS STUFF ABOUT HE IS A

1045
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
REPUBLICAN -- THERE IS NO

1046
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
INFORMATION AT ALL -- I AM

1047
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
TRYING TO DIG DEEPER INTO WHY HE

1048
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
HAS AN ISSUE.

1049
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
>> SEAN: HE DOESN'T HAVE THE

1050
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
ISSUE.
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

1051
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
IT'S AWFUL.

1052
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
A HATE-FILLED SPEECH.

1053
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
THOSE ARE RACIST COMMENTS.

1054
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
HE HAS A WHITE FIANCEE, HE'S A

1055
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
REPUBLICAN.
HE WANTS TO DISAVOW AND SAY HE'S

1056
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
NOT AFRICAN-AMERICAN.

1057
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
IT'S VERY STRANGE BEHAVIOR AND

1058
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
REALLY RUDE.

1059
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
>> SEAN: REACTION?
>> I AM IN SHOCK FOR TWO

1060
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
REASONS.

1061
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
NUMBER 1, I THINK HIS COMMENTS

1062
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
WERE TERRIBLE, TO CRITICIZE A

1063
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
MAN FOR HAVING A WHITE FIANCEE.

1064
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
AWFUL.

1065
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I AM SHOCKED BECAUSE I AGREE

1066
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
WITH YOU, SEAN HANNITY.

1067
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS ALERT!

1068
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
TARA DOWDELL AGREES WITH SEAN

1069
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
HANNITY.
ITS COMMENTS WERE WAY OUT OF

1070
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
LINE -- AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO

1071
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
WITH SPORTS?

1072
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
>> AN HONEST DISAGREEMENT WITH

1073
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
SUSAN RICE BECAUSE SHE KNEW --

1074
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS NOT

1075
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
RELATED TO youtube.

1076
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
SHE SAID IT FIVE TIMES.

1077
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
IT'S A WAR ON WOMEN AND IT'S

1078
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
RACISM.
THIS IS AN ONGOING FALSE

1079
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
NARRATIVE ABOUT REPUBLICANS.

1080
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I AM SICK OF IT BECAUSE I DON'T

1081
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
KNOW CONSERVATIVES THAT ARE

1082
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
RACIST.

1083
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I DON'T.
THEY MIGHT BE SOME.

1084
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
THEY ARE NOT FRIENDS OF OURS.

1085
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
THEY ARE NOT IN THE REPUBLICAN

1086
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
PARTY AND IF THEY ARE, I WANT

1087
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
THEM OUT.

1088
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I AM GETTING FED UP AND SICK AND

1089
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
TIRED OF IT.

1090
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
NBC IS THE WORST.

1091
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
