SANDY HOOK IS STILL A CRIME

95
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
SCENE THAT IS WHERE SIX

ADULTS AND 20 CHILDREN WERE

97
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
SINGLE WITNESS.

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
THAT WILL UNFORTUNATELY HAVE

107
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
TO INCLUDE THE CHILDREN FROM

108
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
THE SCHOOL WHO SURVIVED THE

109
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
SHOOTING.
I ASKED THE LIEUTENANT

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
EARLIER TODAY ABOUT HOW THEY

111
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000

I CAN TELL YOU THAT ANY

117
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
INTERVIEWS WITH ANY CHILDREN

118
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000

AND WITH INVESTIGATORS AS

121
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
APPROPRIATE.

122
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
THE INVESTIGATORS WILL

123
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
DETERMINE HOW, WHEN, WHERE

124
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
AND WHY WE'LL DO THIS.

125
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000

126
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000

132
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
HE MAY HAVE ATTENDED SANDY

THE ONES HE DID ENDED UP

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
WITH A GPA OF 3.26.

142
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
WE LEARNED THE WEAPONS HE

143
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000

144
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000

ACTUAL SHOOTER, ADAM LANZA,

24-YEAR-OLD BROTHER.

163
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
THE INVESTIGATORS SPOKE WITH

164
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
HIM.
THEY SPOKE WITH THE FATHER

165
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
OF THESE TWO BOYS.

166
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
THE PARENTS WERE DIVORCED.

167
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
HAVE THEY BEEN ABLE TO OFFER

168
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
THE POLICE ANY ASSISTANCE

169
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
THAT IS MEANINGFUL AND HAVE

170
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
THEY NOW BEEN CLEARED OF

171
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
ANYTHING IN THIS

172
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
INVESTIGATION?

173
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
>> Reporter: MY

174
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
UNDERSTANDING IS THEY HAVE

175
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
BEEN CLEARED.

176
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
THEY WERE ALSO DESCRIBED AS

177
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
VERY COOPERATIVE.

178
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
THEY GAVE INVESTIGATORS

179
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
INSIGHT TO THE MINDSET OF AD

180
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
MANY TODAY LANZA.

181
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
MY UNDERSTANDING THEY WERE

182
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
ESTRANGED FOR SOME TIME.

183
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
AS YOU MAY KNOW, APPARENTLY

184
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
ADAM WAS CARRYING RYAN'S

185
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
IDENTIFICATION.

186
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
WHEN HE WAS FOUND IN THE

187
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
SCHOOL THAT'S WHY THEY

188
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
INITIALLY THOUGHT HE MIGHT
BE RYAN.

189
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
THAT IS WHAT SENT

190
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
INVESTIGATORS TO RYAN'S HOME

191
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000

00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
HAD NO CRIMINAL HISTORY BUT

198
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
WAS OBVIOUSLY UNWELL.

199
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
HER MOTHER LED TO A

200
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
SHELTERED LIFE OF HER SON.

201
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
WHEN SHE WAS IN TOWN SHE

202
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
DIDN'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT

203
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
HER SOME AD DOOM.

204
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
SHE PULLED HIM OUT OF FOR

205
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
HOMESCHOOLING.

206
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
THESE ARE ALL THE REPORTS

207
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000

208
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
ANY INSIGHT FROM THE THOSE

209
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
WHO KNEW THE BOY GROWING UP

210
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
AND WHAT HE WAS LIKE AND

211
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
WHETHER THERE WERE RED FLAGS

212
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
SO MANY MENTAL HEALTH

213
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
EXPERTS THERE ARE IN THESE

214
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
TYPES OF SITUATIONS?

215
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
>> Reporter: YOU KNOW WE'VE

216
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
BEEN TOLD THAT HE WAS SOCIAL

217
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
LE AWKWARD.

218
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
WE ALSO HEARD HE WAS RARELY

219
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
SEEN.
THAT HIS MOTHER KEPT HIM

220
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
SHELTERED INSIDE THE HOME

221
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
AND HE RARELY LEFT THAT

222
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
HOUSE.
NOT HEARING A LOT FROM

223
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY

224
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
ABOUT HIM.

225
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
SORT OF A MYSTERY KID.

226
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
AGAIN, WAS ONLY APPARENTLY

227
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
AT THAT SCHOOL FOR A SHORT

228
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
TIME BEFORE HE WAS PULLED

229
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
OUT, SENT TO ANOTHER SCHOOL

230
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
AND HOMESCHOOLED.

231
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
THERE ARE REPORTS, MEGYN,

232
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000

BUT, OBVIOUSLY JUST A

237
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE

238
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
SITUATION.

239
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000

246
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
KIND OF HOME LIFE ADAM LANZA

247
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
HAD AND THE KIND OF

248
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
STRUGGLES HIS FAMILY WAS

249
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
FACING.

250
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
BY ALL REPORTS THE GUNMAN'S

251
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
MOTHER, NANCY LANZA WAS THE

252
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
FIRST VICTIM.

253
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
FRIENDS SAY SHE WAS

254
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
EXTREMELY WORRIED ABOUT HER

255
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
SON PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST

256
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
COUPLE OF YEARS.

257
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000

FAMILY FRIEND ABOUT THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADAM

260
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
AND HIS MOTHER.

261
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
>> Reporter: YOU SAID THERE

262
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
WERE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT

263
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
SHE TRIED TO DO BECAUSE SHE

264
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
HAD A HARD TIME BONDING WITH

265
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
HIM?

266
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
>> YEAH.
SHE WAS TRYING TO BOND, FIND

267
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
WAYS TO BOND WITH HIM AND

268
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
YOU KNOW, SHE TOLD ME THAT

269
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
THE GUNS, YOU KNOW, SHE

270
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
WOULD TAKE THEM SHOOTING

271
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
BECAUSE THAT WAS A WAY THAT,

272
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
YOU KNOW, A SINGLE MOM

273
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
COULD, YOU KNOW, RELATE TO

274
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
HER SON.

275
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
AND SO SHE WOULD TAKE HIM,

276
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
TAKE HIM OUT SHOOTING.

277
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
MEGYN: GIVEN WHAT WE'RE

278
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
LEARNING ABOUT ADAM AND HIS

279
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
APPARENT TROUBLES THE

280
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
QUESTION BECOMES, SHOULD

281
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
SOMEONE HAVE SEEN THIS

282
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
COMING?

283
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
DR. ALAN LIPMAN, CRIMINAL

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE AS

290
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
SOMEONE WHO CAN PROVIDE

291
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
INSIGHT TO THE CRIMINAL

292
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
MIND.

293
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
MANY FOLKS WANT TO BELIEVE

294
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
THIS IS A STORY ABOUT ANY

295
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
NUMBER OF THINGS, GUN

296
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
CONTROL, WHAT HAVE YOU, BUT

297
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
AT THE BEGINNING DON'T WE

298
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
HAVE TO START WITH WHAT MADE

299
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THE SHOOTER WANT TO KILL?

300
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
>> WELL, LET'S THINK ABOUT

301
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
THIS AND IT IS TRUE AGAIN

302
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
YOU AND I JOIN IN A TRAGIC

303
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
SITUATION AND OUR HEARTS OF

304
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
COURSE GO OUT TO THOSE

305
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
FAMILIES IN CONNECTICUT.

306
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
EVERYONE OF US ACROSS THE

307
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
NATION.

308
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
BUT, LOOK, THE FACT IS, THAT

309
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
AS WE'VE SEEN, WE SAW IN

310
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
AURORA, COLORADO, WITH

311
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
HOLMES, WE SAW IN VIRGINIA

312
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
TECH WITH CHO AND WE SAW

313
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
WITH LOUGHNER IN TUCSON,

314
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
ARIZONA, IN EVERY SINGLE ONE

315
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
OF THESE CASES AND U.S.

316
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
SECRET SERVICE STUDY LOOKED

317
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
AT OVER 20 YEARS OF THESE

318
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
EPISODES, BEFORE VIRTUALLY

319
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
EVERY SINGLE ONE THERE WAS

320
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
UNDIAGNOSED OR

321
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
INSUFFICIENTLY TREATED

322
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
MENTAL ILLNESS.

323
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
AGAIN WE SEE AT THE PRIME

324
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
AGE, LATE TEENS OR EARLY 20s,

325
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
WHEN A PERSON ERUPTS INTO

326
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
PSYCHOSIS, THIS IS WHAT

327
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
WE'RE SEEING AGAIN WITH ADAM

328
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
LANZA.
YOU JUST REPORTED, ONE OF

329
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
YOUR REPORTERS WAS NOTING

330
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
THAT NANCY LANZA WAS HAVING

331
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
INCREASING TROUBLE WITH ADAM

332
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
OVER THESE LAST COUPLE

333
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
YEARS.

334
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS.

335
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
THE PERSON FIRST SHOWS A

336
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
PATTERN OF ABNORMAL SOCIAL

337
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
BEHAVIOR.

338
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
THAT IS A KEY SIGN OF THE,

339
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
PRECEDING SIGNS OF

340
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
SCHIZOPHRENIA.
THEY BECOME MORE AND MORE

341
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
DIFFICULT.

342
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
IN LATE TEENS OR EARLY 20s

343
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
THEY BREAK INTO SIGH COAST

344
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
KISS.
QUITE LIKELY ALTHOUGH WE

345
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
DON'T KNOW FOR CERTAIN, THAT

346
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
IS THE CASE AS IN ALL OF

347
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
THESE OTHER SHOOTINGS THAT

348
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
WE'VE SEEN HAPPENED HERE --

349
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
PSYCHOSIS.
MEGYN: RIGHT.

350
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
>> MEGYN, IT IS THE CASE IF

351
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
YOU HAVE SOMEONE AS WITH

352
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
HOLMES, AS WITH LOUGHNER AND

353
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
APPEARS TO BE THE CASE WITH

354
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
LANZA, CHO, ALL THE WAY BACK

355
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
TO COLUMBINE, IF YOU HAVE

356
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
SOMEONE FILLED WITH RAGE,

357
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
FILLED WITH DELUSIONS,

358
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
FILLED WITH VENGANCE AND

359
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
THEY CAN SIMPLY LAY THEIR

360
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
HANDS ON SOMETHING THAT WILL

361
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
ALLOW THAT VENGANCE TO BE

362
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
QUICKLY ACTED UPON RATHER

363
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
THAN DELAYED, THAT IS A VERY

364
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
POWERFUL COMBINATION.

365
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
WE, NEED TO BEGIN A NATIONAL

366
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
DIALOGUE IN WHICH WE TEACH

367
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
PEOPLE HOW TO IDENTIFY THE

368
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
SIGNS OF MENTAL ILLNESS THAT

369
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
WE HAVE BEEN SO AFRAID TO

370
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
LOOK AT.
YOU KNOW, IN EVERYONE OF

371
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
THESE INCIDENTS BEFOREHAND I

372
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
HEARD OVER THE YEARS SINCE

373
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
EARLY DAYS AT YALE, HOW CAN

374
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
THIS HAPPEN?

375
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAS

376
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
HAPPENED?

377
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN IT?

378
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
WE KNOW WHY.

379

WHAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

WE DON'T KNOW THAT'S WHAT

400
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
HAPPENED HERE BUT CLEARLY --

401

HERE IS WHAT I BELIEVE.

I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT NOW FOR

408

OVER 20 YEARS.

409
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
THERE ARE TWO REASONS, OKAY?

410
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
THE FIRST, WE AS A NATION

411
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT

412
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
MENTAL ILLNESS SHOULD NOT BE

413
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
STIGMATIZED AND IT IS NOT AN

414
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
EXCUSE.

415
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
THESE PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE

416
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
FOR THEIR ACTIONS.

417
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
BUT IF WE DON'T LOOK AT THAT

418
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
CAUSE, IF WE DON'T LEARN TO

419
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
SEE IT, UNDERSTAND IT, SEE

420
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
THE SIGNS, AND LEARN HOW TO

421
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000

OF THIS NATION, WE WILL SEE

424

THIS CYCLE REPEAT AGAIN AND

425
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
AGAIN.
WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT, TO

426
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000

INTERVENE.

430
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
AND SECONDLY, IF WE KNOW

431
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
THAT WE HAVE A CHILD WHO IS

432
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
HOW FAR SHOULD WE GO TO KEEP OUR

563
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
KIDS SAFE?

564
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
DR. JAMES SHAW IS A SCHOOL

565
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
SECURITY, SAFETY AND VIOLENCE

566
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
EXPERT, A TRUE EXPERT AT THE

567
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
CHICAGO SCHOOL OF PSYCHOLOGY AND

568
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
AUTHOR OF THE BOOK "JACK AND

569
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
JILL, WHY THEY KILL" YOU SPOKE

570
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
AT THE COMMENCEMENT CEREMONY AT

571
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL SHORTLY

572
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
AFTER THE MASSACRE THERE AND YOU

573
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

574
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ADOLESCENT

575
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
SIDE, I MEAN YOUNG, YOUNG PEOPLE

576
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
IN THIS COUNTRY, WHETHER IT'S

577
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
LATE TEENS OR EARLY 20S,

578
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
COMMITTING MASS MURDER.

579
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
BACK THEN THIS IS YOU APRIL 20,

580
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
2000 SAYING, WE MUST REQUIRE OF

581
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
OURSELVES THAT WE DO MORE THAN

582
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
GRIEVE.

583
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
WHAT KIND OF INSPIRATION,

584
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
MOTIVATION OR DIRECTION DO WE

585
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
MEAD TO MAKE US PROTECT OUR

586
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
CHILDREN AGAINST VIOLENCE,

587
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
INCLUDING IN SCHOOL?

588
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
APPARENTLY WE NEEDED A LITTLE

589
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
MORE.

590
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
>> I AGREE, MEGYN.

591
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
DR. LIPMAN SAID A LOT OF

592
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
TRUTHFUL THINGS IN HIS

593
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
STATEMENT.
ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAID IS TO

594
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
LOOK FOR THE SIGNS.
I WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO THAT.

595
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
LOOK FOR THE SIGNS OF SOMEONE

596
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
WHO IS GETTING READY TO ENGAGE

597
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
IN NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR.

598
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
FOR EXAMPLE, MORE AND MORE PRESS

599
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
STORIES ARE SAYING THAT THE

600
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
SLAIN SHOOTER, ADAM LANZA HAD A

601
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
VERBAL CONFLICT WITH SCHOOL

602
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
STAFF THE DAY BEFORE THE

603
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
SHOOTING, LESS THAN 24 HOURS

604
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
BEFORE HE WENT OFF, SO TO

605
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
SPEAK.
WE NOW SADLY KNOW AFTER THE FACT

606
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
THAT WE CAN USE VERBAL DISPUTES

607
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
AS SCHOOL PEOPLE, VERBAL

608
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
CONTACTS, THREATS, AS A REPB T

609
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
AS A REASON TO DENY ENTRY.

610
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
IF YOU HAVE A VERBAL DISPUTE

611
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
WITH SOMEONE YOU DON'T LET THEM

612
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
THROUGH INTO THE SCHOOL.

613
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
AIRLINES HAVE DONE THAT, IF

614
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
SOMEONE IS ACTING VERBALLY OR

615
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
MAKING THREATS, HE OR SHE CANNOT

616
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
GET ON THE PLANE.

617
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
MEGYN: WE KNOW HE SHOT HIS WAY

618
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
IN THE NEXT DAY MAYBE YOU ARE ON

619
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
A HIGHER ALERT WHEN AN

620
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
ALTERCATION HAS TAKEN PLACE.

621
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
MAYBI DEFINITELY WANT TO SPEAK

622
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
WITH YOU.

623
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
JAY CARNEY HAS JUST BEEN ASKED

624
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL AND WHETHER

625
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
THAT WILL BE A NEW PUSH BY THE

626
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
PRESIDENT.

627
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
>> I THINK THAT IT'S PART OF IT,

628
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
BUT IT IS FAR FROM AWFU FROM

629
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
ALL OF IT.

630
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
AS YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS

631
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
TAKEN POSITIONS ON COMMON-SENSE

632
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
MEASURES THAT HE BELIEVES SHOULD

633
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
BE TAKEN TO HELP ADDRESS THIS

634
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
PROBLEM, BUT HE MADE CLEAR THAT

635
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE, THAT WE

636
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
AS A NATION HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH

637
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
CLEARLY TO FULFILL OUR NUMBER

638
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
ONE OBLIGATION, WHICH IS TO

639
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

640
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
>> ONE MORE ON THIS.

641
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
AS YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN THESE

642
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
HORRIFIC MOMENTS COME AND GO,

643
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
AND THE DEBATE GOOD GUN SAFETY,

644
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
CHILDREN SAFETY GOES WITNESS.

645
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
DOES THE PRESIDENT THINK THAT HE

646
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
NEEDS TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS AND

647
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
GET THIS CONVERSATION GOING AND

648
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
SEE SOME ACTION IN THE SHORT

649
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
TERM, OR DOES HE FEEL LIKE HE

650
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
CAN GET THROUGH FISCAL CLIFF,

651
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
IMMIGRATION AND THERE IS NOW A

652
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
MINDSET AND A WILL TO GET THIS

653
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
DONE MONTHS DOWN THE LINE?

654
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
>> I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC

655
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
TIMELINE FOR YOU FOR WHAT THE

656
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
PRESIDENT WILL DO MOVING

657
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
FORWARD.
I WOULD SIMPLY REFER YOU TO HIS

658
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
REMARKS LAST NIGHT WHEN HE

659
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
TALKED ABOUT THE ACTION HE HOPED

660
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
TO TAKE TO ENGAGE THE AMERICAN

661
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
PEOPLE IN THE COMING WEEKS.

662
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED AT

663
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HAS

664
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
CLEARLY SHOCKED THE ENTIRE

665
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
NATION, AND HAS LAID BARE THE

666
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
NECESSITY OF EVALUATING THE

667
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
VARIOUS THINGS THAT WE CAN AND

668
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
MUST DO AS A NATION TO TRY TO

669
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
BETTER PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

670
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
>> QUICKLY ON FISCAL CLIFF, THE

671
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
PRESIDENT SAID TO THE BUSINESS

672
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
ROUNDTABLE RECENTLY THAT

673
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
REPUBLICANS NEED TO REACH WHAT

674
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
HE CALLED A CONCEPTUAL

675
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
BREAKTHROUGH ON RATES, TAX RATES

676
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
GOING UP AND ONCE THAT HAPPENS

677
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
THE DEAL WILL COME TOGETHER

678
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
PRETTY QUICKLY.

679
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
DOES HE FEEL HE HAS THAT NOW

680
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
THAT SPEAKER BOEHNER IS TALKING

681
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
ABOUT RATES, AS FAR AS IN

682
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
CONVERSATION?

683
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
>> I WON'T COMMENT ON SPECIFIC

684
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
REPORTED PROPOSALS OR COUNTER

685
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
PROPOSALS ON INTERNAL

686
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE

687
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
PRESIDENT AND THE SPEAKER, OR

688
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM AND THE

689
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
SPEAKERS TEAM, OR WITH OTHER

690
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
MEMBERS OF LEADERSHIP.

691
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
THE PRESIDENT'S INSISTENCE THAT

692
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
RATES NEED TO GO UP ON THE TOP

693
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
2% WAS BASED ON AN ECONOMIC

694
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
REALITY, WHICH IS THAT IN ORDER

695
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
TO ACHIEVE A BROAD DEFICIT

696
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
REDUCTION IMAGINE THAT PUTS OUR

697
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
ECONOMY --

698
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
MEGYN: HR-RBGTS YO YOU HEARD

699
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
JAY CARNEY ECHOING WHAT

700
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID LAST

701
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
NIGHT.
THE PRESIDENT IN ELLA KWEPBT

702
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
REMARKS IN NEWTOWN TALKED ABOUT

703
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
HOW WE ARE FAILING OUR CHILDREN

704
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
IN THIS NATION, WE ARE FAILING

705
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
THEM WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR

706
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
SAFETY.
AND THAT HE'S BEEN TO TOO MANY

707
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
OF THESE MEMORIAL SERVICES WHERE

708
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
INNOCENT VICTIMS ARE BEING

709
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
KILLED, AND HE DIDN'T SPEAK

710
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL, HE JUST

711
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
TALKED ABOUT HOW HE NEEDED TO

712
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
SIT WITH ADVISERS, WITH EXPERTS

713
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
AND COME UP WITH WAYS THAT WE

714
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
CAN IMPROVE THE SITUATION.

715
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
MANY BELIEVED HE WAS TALKING

716
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
MAYBE AT LEAST IN PART ABOUT AN

717
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN WHICH HAS

718
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
BEEN VERY MUCH IN THE NEWS

719
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
LATELY BUT THE WHITE HOUSE NOT

720
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
CONFIRMING THAT RIGHT THERE.

721
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
A CONVERSATION IS GOING TO BEGIN

722
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
IN THIS COUNTRY AND HOPEFULLY

723
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
ABOUT MANY ISSUES, INCLUDING AS

724
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
WE TALKED ABOUT MOMENTS AGO,

725
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
WHAT WOULD MAKE SWAN WANT TO

726
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
KILL IN THISOMEONE WANT TO KILL

727
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
IN THIS WAY IN THE FIRST PLACE.

728
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
WE HAD DR. JAMES SHAW, HIS

729
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
SATELLITE FEED WENT DOWN.

730
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
WE WILL GET HIM BACK UP.

731
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I REALLY DO WANT YOU TO HEAR

732
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
FROM HIM.
IT'S SO HARD TO FIND PEOPLE WHO

733
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
ARE TRULY EXPERTS IN THIS KIND

734
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
OF THING, IN SCHOOL SECURITY AND

735
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
HE'S ONE OF THEM.

736
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
WE GOT HIM?

737
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
LET'S BRING BACK DR. SHAW.

738
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
WELCOME BACK.
IN TERMS OF RECOGNIZING THE

739
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
SIGNS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,

740
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
MOST PEOPLE ARE REGULAR FOLKS,

741
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
THEY SEE SOMEBODY, HE'S WEIRD,

742
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
HE'S ODD, HE'S SHY, HE KEEPS TO

743
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
HIMSELF.
THIS GUY THEY SAID HE DRESSED

744
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
MORE FORMALLY, HE HELD A

745
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
BRIEFCASE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

746
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
HE WOULD PUSH UP AGAIN THE

747
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
LOCKERS WHEN FRIENDS WENT BY, HE

748
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
DIDN'T LIKE TO TALK TO ANYBODY.

749
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
HOW DO YOU DISCERN THAT FROM SHY

750
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
NECESSARY, AWKWARDNESS,

751
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
ASBURGERS WHICH CAN BE A SOCIAL

752
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
IMPEDIMENT FOR SOME FOLKS FROM A

753
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
WOULD BE MURDERER.

754
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
>> I WOULD ADVISE EVERYBODY NOT

755
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
TO START LABELING, NOT USE TERMS

756
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
LIKE ASBURGERS OR AUTISM.

757
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I THINK THAT IS INCORRECT, IT'S

758
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
WRONG, IT'S OFFENSIVE, IT'S LIKE

759
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
LABELING SOMEONE WHO IS TOO

760
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
SHORT OR TOO TALL OR

761
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
LEFT-HANDED, THAT KIND OF

762
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
THING.

763
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I THINK IN THE IMMEDIATE NEWT WE

764
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
NEED TO START PAYING ATTENTION

765
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
TO POTENTIAL COPY-CATS.

766
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
AFTER COLUMBINE THERE WERE A

767
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
SPAYED OF COPY-CAT-TYPE EVENTS

768
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
ON HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES AROUND

769
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
THE COUNTRY.

770
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I HOPE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN HERE,

771
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP OUR

772
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
RADAR UP AND ON, IN THE EVENT,

773
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
IN THE PROSPECT THAT THERE IS A

774
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
COPY-CAT OUT THERE WANTING TO

775
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
GET SOME KIND OF PRESTIGE,

776
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
WANTING TO GET SOME KIND OF

777
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
FLATTERY AND ATTENTION.

778
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
MEGYN: WE SAW IT AFTER

779
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
COLUMBINE.
DR. ABLOW WAS ON THE PROGRAM ON

780
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
FRIDAY TALKING ABOUT ONE OF THE

781
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
REASONS THIS IS VERY DISTURBING

782
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN NEWTOWN, WE

783
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
STILL BELIEVED IN THE WAKE OF

784
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
COLUMBINE AND OTHER INCIDENTS

785
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN RED

786
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
LINES, EVEN THE MENTALLY

787
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
DERANGED, EVEN TERRORISTS WON'T

788
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
CROSS AND THE MASS MURDER OF SIX

789
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS WAS ONE OF

790
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
THEM, WE JUST STILL BELIEVED

791
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
THAT.

792
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
THE FEAR IS THAT NOW THAT ONE

793
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
PERSON HAS CROSSED THAT RED

794
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
LINE, WHETHER IT'S ELIMINATED,

795
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
WHETHER THE RED LINE IS GONE.

796
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
DR. SHAW, AS SOMEBODY WHO DOES

797
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
THIS FOR A LIVING, WHAT DO YOU

798
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
SAY TO THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS OUT

799
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
THERE WHO NOW HAVE TO WORRY

800
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
ABOUT COPY-CATS AND THE PARENTS

801
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
OUT THERE WHO ARE VERY

802
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
CONCERNED?

803
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
>> I THINK SCHOOL DISTRICT, AND

804
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS, AND

805
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
BOARDS OF EDUCATION, AND SCHOOL

806
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
PRINCIPALS NEED TO WORKDAY LEE,

807
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
IF NECESSARY, WITH LAW

808
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
ENFORCEMENT TO COME UP WITH

809
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
COGENT, STRATEGIC SCHOOL SAFETY

810
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
PLANS THAT MAKE SENSE, THAT ARE

811
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
EXECUTABLE AND THAT ARE

812
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
CURRENT.

813
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I THINK SCHOOLS NEED CAMERAS,

814
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
HIGH-TECH, HIGH CAPACITY CAMERAS

815
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
IN THEIR FRONT OFFICES AND

816
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
OUTSIDE THE FRONT OFFICES,

817
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
AROUND PASSAGEWAYS AND

818
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
HALLWAYS.

819
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I THINK SCHOOLS NEED TO HAVE

820
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
VISITOR SIGN ENTRY LOGS AND EXIT

821
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
LOGS.
JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW A PERSON,

822
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
BECAUSE HE OR SHE IS REPEATEDLY

823
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
AT YOUR DESK IN THE FRONT HOFS

824
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
DOES NOT MEAN YOU LET YOUR GUARD

825
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
DOWN, DOES NOT MEAN YOU LET THEM

826
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
THROUGH THE ELECTRONIC GAME.

827
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I AM CHEERED AND ENCOURAGED BY

828
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S WANTING TO

829
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
HELP EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN

830
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
THE NATION.

831
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR HIM

832
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
TO LOOK AT THE FORMER DRUG

833
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
AND -- SAFE AND DRUG FREE

834
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
SCHOOLS ACT WHICH HAD BILLIONS

835
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
OF DOLLARS IN PAST

836
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
ADMINISTRATIONS OR TWO.

837
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
HOWEVER THEY WERE FUNDING THINGS

838
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
SUCH AS MAGIC SHOWS, AND DUNKING

839
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
TANKS AT SCHOOLS.

840
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
WE CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN

841
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
THAT.
MEGYN: YOU KNOW, AND I -- WE'LL

842
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
TALK A LOT MORE ABOUT AUTISM AND

843
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
ASBURGERS.
THAT REPORTEDLY COMES FROM ADAM

844
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
LANZA'S BROTHER TO THE POLICE

845
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
SAYING THAT HE WAS ON THE AUTISM

846
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
SPECTRUM, AND WE WILL TALK A LOT

847
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
MORE ABOUT WAVING THAT MEANS.

848
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I MEAN, YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE

849
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
IN THAT COUNTRY HAVE A DIAGNOSIS

850
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
OF SOME PLACE ON THE AUTISM

851
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
SPECTRUM, AND THE VAST MAJORITY

852
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
HAVE NO VIOLENT TENDENCIES, AND

853
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
THAT'S AN ASIDE ACCORDING TO

854
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
MOST OF THE EXPERTS BUT HAS

855
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
BECOME THE FOCUS OF SO MANY.

856
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHETHER THAT

857
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
IS FAIR AND WHAT PEOPLE REALLY

858
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
NEED TO LOOK THE HERE.

859
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I KNOW IT'S ONLY BEEN 72 HOURS.

860
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
THIS GUY THE POLICE SAY HE SHOT

861
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
HIS WAY IN.

862
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
THEY HAD THE CAMERAS AND THE

863
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
LOCKDOWN, THE TEACHERS DID

864
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
EVERYTHING RIGHT FROM THE SOUND

865
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
OF IT.

866
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
HOW COULD THEY HAVE DONE

867
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY ON FRIDAY?

868
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
>> I DON'T KNOW, MEGYN THAT THEY

869
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
COULD HAVE.

870
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I THINK THE TEACHERS, GOD REST

871
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
THEM, I THINK THE TEACHERS DID

872
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
EVERYTHING THEY POSSIBLY COULD.

873
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
THEY GAVE THEIR LIVES.

874
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
THEY RAN TOWARD THE SHOOTER, THE

875
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
PRINCIPAL, AND A TEACHER,

876
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
ANOTHER TEACHER OR TWO RAN

877
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
TOWARD THE SHOOTER TO BLOCK AND

878
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
PROTECT -- BLOCK AND PROTECT

879
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
KIDS BEHIND THEM AND AROUND

880
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
THEM.
WHEN YOU'VE DONE ALL THAT YOU

881
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
CAN DO, WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU

882
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
FAILED TO DO?

883
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I DON'T KNOW.

884
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I THINK THAT IS AN ETERNAL

885
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
QUESTION THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE

886
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
CLINTON IS WILLING TO WORK WITH

1113
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
THE COMMITTEES ON THAT.

1114
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND WHERE

1115
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
DOES IT STAND.

1116
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
MONICA CROWLEY IS A SYNDICATED

1117
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
TALK SHOW HOST AND A FOX NEWS

1118
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
CONTRIBUTOR.
WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE.

1119
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
>> OF COURSE,.

1120
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
MEGYN: TO DEVELOP INTO POLITICS

1121
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
SEEMS LIKE AN ESCAPE FROM THIS

1122
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
WHOLE STORY RIGHT NOW.

1123
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON?

1124
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
STHAO*E SHE FAINTED SOME TIME

1125
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
LAST WEEK AND CAN'T SHOW UP THIS

1126
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
THURSDAY FOR A PREVIOUSLY

1127
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
SCHEDULED TESTIMONY?

1128
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
THERE WAS SPECULATION I WANT

1129
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
VIEWERS TO KNOW ABOUT WHETHER

1130
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
SHE'D REALLY SHOW UP AND DO IT.

1131
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
>> EVEN BEFORE THE FALL AND THE

1132
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
CONCUSSION.
MEGYN: I'M NOT SUGGESTING SHE

1133
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
DIDN'T GET A CONCUSSION.

1134
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT DO WE

1135
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
BELIEVE THIS IS AN SUSAN WILL

1136
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
SHE SHOW UP TO TESTIFY.

1137
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
>> THE REASON WE ARE ASKING THE

1138
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS VIRUS WITH

1139
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
IMPECCABLE TIMING IS FROM THE

1140
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
VERY BEGINNING, FROM

1141
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
SEPTEMBER 11th THE DAY OF THE

1142
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
ATTACK IN BENGHAZI THAT RESULTED

1143
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
IN THE DEATHS OF FOUR AMERICAN

1144
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
CITIZENS THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN

1145
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
ABLE TO GET A STRAIGHT STORY OR

1146
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
FRANKLY ANYBODY FROM THIS

1147
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
ADMINISTRATION ON THE RECORD

1148
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
WITH A CLEAR EXPLANATION NOT

1149
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
JUST FOR THE FOUR FAMILIES BUT

1150
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

1151
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
MEGYN: SHE IS GOING TO SEND SOME

1152
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
LIEUTENANTS.

1153
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
IT'S NOT LIKE ALL TESTIMONY HAS

1154
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
BEEN WITHDRAWN AND WE ARE NOT

1155
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
GOING TO GET SOMEBODY

1156
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
KNOWLEDGEABLE WE PRESUME BEFORE

1157
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
CAPITOL HILL BUT IT'S NOT THE

1158
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
SECRETARY OF STATE.

1159
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
AND SHE SAID THE BUCK STOPS WITH

1160
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
ME.

1161
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
SO THESE LAWMAKERS WANT TO HEAR

1162
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
FROM HER, INCLUDING SENATOR KER

1163
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
RAOEFPLT HE IS THE ONE WHO

1164
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
REPORTEDLY SAID TO HER DON'T

1165
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
COME, YOU DON'T FEEL WELL BUT HE

1166
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
WANTS TO HEAR FROM HER AS WELL

1167
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
OVER ON THE SENATE SIDE.

1168
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
>> AND SHE CAN STILL BE CALLED.

1169
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
EVEN AFTER SHE STEPPED DOWN

1170
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
PRESUMABLY AND SENATOR KERRY

1171
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
TAKES HER POSITION SHE CAN STILL

1172
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
BE CALLED BEFORE THE CONGRESS

1173
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
AND SHE LIKELY STILL L. BUT THE

1174
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
PROBLEM IS THAT THIS KIND --

1175
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
HERE WE ARE ALMOST THREE MONTHS

1176
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 11th

1177
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
ATTACKS IN BENGHAZI.
WE ARE STILL AWAITING ANSWERS.

1178
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
WE STILL CAN'T GET A STRAIGHT

1179
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
STORY FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION,

1180
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
AND THOSE WHO ARE IN THE UPPER

1181
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
LEVELS OF AUTHORITY HERE, WHO

1182
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
OVERSAW THIS OR AT LEAST HAVE

1183
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT, INCLUDING

1184
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
THE SECRETARY OF STATE, NONE OF

1185
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
OF THEM HAVE PUT THEMSELVES IN A

1186
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
POSITION BEFORE CONGRESS, BEFORE

1187
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
THE MEDIA, BEFORE THE AMERICAN

1188
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
PEOPLE TO ANSWER FOR THIS.

1189
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
IT'S WHAT I THINK DRAWS A LOT OF

1190
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
THE FRUSTRATION ON CAPITOL HILL

1191
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
AND I THINK IN THE PUBLIC.

1192
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
MEGYN: HOW DOES IT WORK FOR HER

1193
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
IF JUST HER TOP LIEUTENANTS

1194
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
TESTIFY AND SHE NEVER DOES?

1195
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
THIS CONGRESS IS ENDING AT THE

1196
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
END OF THIS YEAR, WE'LL START A

1197
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
NEW ONE, AND SHE CAN WE ARE TOLD

1198
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
BE CALLED BEFORE THE NEW

1199
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
CONGRESS AND MAY EVEN THOUGH

1200
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
SHE'LL BE OUT OF A JOB BECAUSE

1201
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
SHE IS LEAVING HER POSITION AS

1202
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
SECRETARY OF STATE.

1203
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
WE SAW THAT WITH WHAT'S HIS

1204
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
NAME, GENERAL.

1205
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
>> PETRAEUS.

1206
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
MEGYN: HE LEFT HIS POST AND WENT

1207
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
BECOME TO TESTIFY.

1208
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT SHE WILL

1209
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
AND HOW MUCH IF ANY DOES THIS

1210
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
HAVE TO DO WITH HILLARY 2016.

1211
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
>> I THINK A LOT OF THIS.

1212
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
SO MUCH OF THIS HAPPENED ON HER

1213
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
WATCH.

1214
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS

1215
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
PRESUMABLY IN THIS REPORT, THIS

1216
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
INSPECTOR'S REVIEW REPORT COMING

1217
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
OUT TODAY THAT WILL BE

1218
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
TRANSFERRED OVER TO CONGRESS,

1219
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
MAYBE EVEN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

1220
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
HAVE IT NOW TO LOOK AT, THAT

1221
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
WILL CONTAIN SOME MIGHTY

1222
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
EMBARRASSING THINGS FOR HER AND

1223
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
FOR HER DEATH.
UNDERSTANDABLE SHE DOESN'T WANT

1224
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
TO HAVE TO ANSWER FOR IT.

1225
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
BUT SHE IS IN THE POSITION OF

1226
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
AUTHORITY WHERE THE BUCK REALLY

1227
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
DOES STOP.

1228
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
THERE ARE SOME POINTS THAT MAYBE

1229
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
SHE ENDS UP LOOKING VINDICATED

1230
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
OR ACTUALLY LOOKING OKAY IN ALL

1231
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
OF THIS.

1232
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
REMEMBER, IN THE MONTHS LEADING

1233
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
UP TO THE SEPTEMBER 11th

1234
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
ATTACKS, MEGYN, SHE AND HER

1235
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
DEPARTMENT, THE STATE DEPARTMENT

1236
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
ACTUALLY REQUESTED ON MULTIPLE

1237
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
OCCASIONS ADDITIONAL SECURITY

1238
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
FOR BENGHAZI.

1239
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
THEY WERE TURNED DOWN.

1240
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
WHO TURNED HER DOWN?

1241
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
WHO TURNED DOWN THE STATE

1242
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
DEPARTMENT TO GIVE AMBASSADOR

1243
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
STEVENS AND THOSE OTHER

1244
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
AMERICANS ADDED SECURITY?

1245
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
WAS IT THE WHITE HOUSE?

1246
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
WELL THERE MAY BE A WHOLE ARRAY

1247
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
OF THINGS THAT SHE MIGHT NOT

1248
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
WANT TO ADDRESS.

1249
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
AGAIN THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT

1250
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
SHE IS THE ONE ULTIMATELY

1251
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
RESPONSIBLE AND SHE DOES HAVE TO

1252
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
ANSWER FOR THIS AT SOME POINT.

1253
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
MEGYN: THE REPUBLICANS STILL

1254
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
CONTROL THE HOUSE, AND WILL IN

1255
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
JANUARY AS WELL.

1256
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
IT'S BEEN A BIPARTISAN PUSH IN

1257
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
THE SENATE TO GET ANSWERS ON

1258
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
THAT.
EVEN THOUGH THE DEMOCRATS

1259
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
CONTROL THAT CHAMBER THEY WANTED

1260
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
ANSWERS FROM SECRETARY CLINTON

1261
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
NOW AND PRESUMABLY WILL WANT

1262
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
THEM AFTER THE NEW YEAR.

1263
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
ANY CHANCE YOU THINK THAT SHE

1264
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
DOESN'T WIND UP SPEAKING TO

1265
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
EITHER BODY?

1266
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

1267
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I THINK SHE CAN'T AVOID THIS FOR

1268
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
MUCH LONGER.
I THINK ALL OF THIS IS SORT OF,

1269
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
THE DELAY IN THE REPORT UNTIL

1270
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
TODAY, RIGHT BEFORE THE

1271
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS.

1272
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
THEN SHE HAS A STOMACH VIRUS AND

1273
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
A CONCUSSION AND NOW IT'S

1274
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
DELAYED EVEN FURTHER.

1275
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I THINK PART OF THE STRATEGY IF

1276
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
THERE IS A STRATEGY HERE IS TO

1277
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
RUN OUT THE POLITICAL CLOCK SO

1278
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
MAYBE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LOSE

1279
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
INTEREST IN THIS WHICH TH*E

1280
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
SHOULD NOT, WE HAVE FOUR DEAD

1281
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
AMERICANS HERE AND WE NEED

1282
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
ANSWERS ABOUT THAT.

1283
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
LEADING INTO A NEW

1284
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S SECOND TERM, A WHOLE NEW

1285
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
CAST OF CHARACTERS.

1286
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
YOU MENTIONED SENATOR KERRY WHO

1287
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
IS GOING TO SUCCEED HER IN THIS

1288
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
JOB.
IT'S PROBABLY IN HIS INTERESTS

1289
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
TO KIND OF SWEEP THIS ASIDE SO

1290
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
HE CAN BEGIN HIS TENURE ANEW.

1291
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
ALL OF THIS UNDERSTANDABLE FROM

1292

01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
WERE SCHEDULED TO START

1654
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

1655
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
TWO 6-YEAR-OLD BOYS LAID TO

1656
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
REST AFTER A CRIME THE

1657
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
PRESIDENT SAYS REMINDS JUST

1658
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
HOW PRECIOUS AND FRAGILE,

1659
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
LOOK AT THOSE FACES A

1660
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
PARENT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH

1661
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
THEIR CHILD CAN BE.

1662
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
>> THERE IS ONLY ONE THING

1663
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
WE CAN BE SURE OF.

1664
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
AND THAT IS THE LOVE THAT WE

1665
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
HAVE.

1666
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
FOR OUR CHILDREN, FOR OUR

1667
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,000
FAMILIES, FOR EACH OTHER.

1668
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
THE WARMTH OF A SMALL

1669
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
CHILD'S EMBRACE.

1670
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
THAT IS TRUE.

1671
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
THE MEMORIES WE HAVE OF THEM,

1672
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
THE JOY THAT THEY BRING, THE

1673
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
WONDER WE SEE THROUGH THEIR

1674
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
EYES.

1675
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
THAT FIERCE AND BOUNDLESS

1676
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
LOVE WE FEEL FOR THEM.

1677
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
A LOVE THAT TAKES US OUT OF

1678
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
OURSELVES AND BIND US TO

1679
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
SOMETHING LARGER.

1680
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,000
WE KNOW THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

1681
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
WE KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS DOING

1682
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
RIGHT WHEN WE'RE TAKING CARE

1683
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
OF THEM.

1684
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
WHEN WE'RE TEACHING THEM

1685
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
WELL.

1686
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
WHEN WE'RE SHOWING ACTS OF

1687
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
KINDNESS.
WE DON'T GO WRONG WITH THEY

1688
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
DO THAT.

1689
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
MEGYN: EVERY PARENT CAN

1690
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
RELATE TO THOSE WORDS.

1691
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I MEAN EVERY PARENT HELD

1692
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
THEIR CHILD A LITTLE TIGHTER

1693
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
THIS WEEKEND.

1694
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
AND WAS REMINDED TO JUST

1695
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
TREASURY THE LOVE YOU HAVE

1696
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
FOR YOUR BABIES, RIGHT?

1697
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
CHIEF CORRESPONDENT ED HENRY

1698
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
IS LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE

1699
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
WITH MORE.

1700
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
AND THERE WAS A QUESTION, NO

1701
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
ONE QUESTIONED CERTAINLY

1702
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
ANYTHING THE PRESIDENT SAID

1703
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
ALONG THOSE LINES, ED.

1704
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
HE WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT

1705
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THE

1706
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
COUNTRY AND HE DIDN'T GET

1707
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
SPECIFIC.

1708
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
CLEARLY SOMETHING NEEDS TO

1709
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
HAPPEN.
>> Reporter: NO DOUBT ABOUT

1710
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
IT, MEGYN.

1711
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I WAS THERE WITH THE

1712
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT,

1713
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
SPEAKING TO PEOPLE IN THE

1714
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
COMMUNITY.

1715
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
SOME OF THEM TOLD ME THAT

1716
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
THEY WALKED FOR ABOUT ONE

1717
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
HOUR IN A VERY COLD RAIN

1718
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
THERE IN NEWTOWN BECAUSE ALL

1719
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
THE PARKING AROUND THAT HIGH

1720
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
SCHOOL WAS ALL FILLED UP.

1721
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
THE AUDITORIUM, FULL.

1722
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
PEOPLE WERE THAT COMMITTED

1723
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
TO TURNING OUT AND TRYING TO

1724
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
DO TWO THINGS.

1725
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
TRYING TO GRIEVE AND MOURN

1726
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
AND HELP HEAL THE PEOPLE WHO

1727
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
HAVE BEEN SO HURT IN THAT

1728
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
COMMUNITY BUT SECONDLY THEY

1729
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
WERE WONDERING WHAT'S NEXT

1730
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
HERE.
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, THE

1731
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
PRESIDENT DID IN GENERAL

1732
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
REFER TO THE IDEA IT WAS

1733
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
SORT OF A CALL TO ACTION IN

1734
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
THE MIDDLE OF THAT SPEECH

1735
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
LAST NIGHT.

1736
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
IT WAS BASICALLY, LIKE, WE

1737
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH TO

1738
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

1739
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
HE WAS HINTING AT GUN

1740
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
CONTROL, OTHER MEASURES

1741
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
POTENTIALLY, BUT AS YOU SAY

1742
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
HE DIDN'T GET SPECIFIC.

1743
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
A FW MOMENTS AGO JAY CARNEY

1744
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
IN THE BRIEFING GOT A LOT OF

1745
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS.

1746
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
REPORTERS PRESSING ABOUT

1747
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
WHAT ACTION THE PRESIDENT

1748
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
WILL ACTUALLY TAKE.

1749
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
HE WAS PRETTY VAGUE ABOUT

1750
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
DETAILS.
TAKE A LISTEN.

1751
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
>> IT'S A COMPLEX PROBLEM

1752
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
THAT WILL REQUIRE A COMPLEX

1753
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
SOLUTION.

1754
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
NO SINGLE PIECE OF

1755
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
LEGISLATION, NO SINGLE

1756
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
ACTION WILL FULLY ADDRESS

1757
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
THE PROBLEM.

1758
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
>> Reporter: JAY CARNEY DID

1759
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
SAY SPECIFICALLY THAT THE

1760
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
PRESIDENT STILL SUPPORTS

1761
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
SOMETHING THAT HE HAD SAID,

1762
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
HE SUPPORTED GOING BACK TO

1763
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,000
THE 2008 PRESS 2008

1764
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

1765
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
RENEWING THE BAN ON ASSAULT

1766
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
WEAPONS WHICH EXPIRED.

1767
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
PRESIDENT SPOKE OUT

1768
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
PREVIOUSLY WHAT HE CALLED

1769
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
WEAPONS OF WAR OFF THE

1770
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
STREETS.
THAT IS ONE SPECIFIC.

1771
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
BUT THEN PRESSED FOR MORE

1772
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
DETAILS HOW QUICKLY THE

1773
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
PRESIDENT WILL ACT, HE

1774
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
REALLY DIDN'T WANT TOO GET

1775
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
INTO THAT.
THAT WILL BE THE QUESTION

1776
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
MOVING FORWARD, HOW MUCH

1777
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
PEOPLE ARE TALKING, WHAT

1778
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
KIND OF ACTION WILL HAPPEN.

1779
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
MEGYN?
MEGYN: ED HENRY, THANK YOU.

1780
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
WE WANT TO GO TO THE

1781
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
WHITE HOUSE TO THE U.S.

1782
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
SENATE WHERE THERE IS MOMENT

1783
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
OF SILENCE FOR THE VICTIMS

1784
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
OF NEWTOWN.

1785
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
[MOMENT OF SILENCE]

1786
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
>> MR. PRESIDENT?

1787
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
>> MAJORITY LEADER.

1788
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
>> REMARKS THE SENATE WILL

1789
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
BE IN MORNING BUSINESS.

1790
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
MEGYN: SENATE MAJORITY
LEADER HARRY REID SPEAKING.

1791
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

1792
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
MOMENTS.

1793
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
IT IS LIKE, WHAT THE COUNTRY

1794
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
FELT AFTER 9/11 WHERE

1795
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
REGARDLESS OF YOUR POLITICS

1796
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
YOU FEEL FIRST AN AMERICAN,

1797
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
YOU FEEL FIRST A PARENT, AND

1798
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
YOU THINK, IT DOESN'T MATTER

1799
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
WHAT YOUR PARTY AFFILIATION

1800
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
IS.

1801
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO

1802
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT LED TO

1803
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
THIS.
AND HOW TO STOP IT FROM

1804
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
HAPPENING AGAIN.

1805
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
WITHOUT ANY QUICK FIXES,

1806
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
WITHOUT ANY QUICK JUDGMENTS

1807
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
TO REALLY LOOK AT IT, TRY TO

1808
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
FIGURE IT OUT.

1809
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
YOU CAN SEE SOME BIPARTISAN

1810
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
SHARING IN THE HEARTBREAK

1811
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
THERE ON CAPITOL HILL
MOMENTS AGO.

1812
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
AMID THE TRAGEDY IN NEWTOWN

1813
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
THERE ARE AMAZING STORIES OF

1814
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
HEROISM.

1815
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
HAVE BEEN SO MOVING, JUST

1816
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
RENEW YOUR BELIEF IN THE

1817
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
HUMAN SPIRIT, DON'T THEY?

1818
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
WE HAVE TO HOLD ONTO THAT.

1819
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
THIS COUNTRY, BEING AN

1820
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
AMERICAN, BEING A HUMAN

1821
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
BEING ON THIS EARTH IS NOT

1822
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
IDENTIFYING WITH ADAM LANZA.

1823
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
IT IS ABOUT IDENTIFYING WITH

1824
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
VICTORIA SOTO AND THAT

1825
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
BEAUTIFUL PRINCIPAL AND ALL

1826
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
THE OTHERS IN THAT SCHOOL

1827

THAT DID SO OF MUCH TO SAVE

1828
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
LIVES, AND TO PROTECT

1829
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
CHILDREN.
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

1830
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
YET WE'RE LEARNING MORE

1831
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
ABOUT THIS CASE AND THIS

1832
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000

TRACE?

1836
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
>> Reporter: THERE ARE SOME

1837
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000

01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
IT IS STILL VERY EARLY BUT

2082
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
WE CAN'T DO TOO MUCH OF

2083
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
THAT.

2084
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
WHY?

2090
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
INEVITABLY IF WE WATCH TV

2091
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
WE'LL GET CERTAIN EMOTIONS.

2092
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000

WE HEAR ABOUT THE PARENT

2098
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000

AND MOST IMPORTANT THING IN

2102
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
OUR LIVES.
WE DON'T NEED FEAR.

2103
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
WE NEED EMPATHY.

2104
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
WE NEED TO CARE FOR HER AND

2105
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
PASSION FOR HER.

OUR CHILDREN, WE NEED

2107
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000

CHILDREN ONLY OCCUR AROUND

2121
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
SCHOOLS LESS THAN ONE

2122
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
PERCENT OF THE TIME.

2123
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
HERE IS ANOTHER THING.

2124
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:30,000
ELIZABETH FELLSPS FROM NYU,

2125
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
MEASURED THE BRAIN, IF

01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000

TO YOU.

2130
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO LIMIT

2131
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
THE AMOUNT OF CONTACT OUR

2132
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
CHILDREN HAVE WITH THESE

2133
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
IMAGES.

MEGYN: AND THAT WE HAVE WITH

01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
THEY FEEL IT.

2141
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
THEY, SAY SORT OF LIKE,

2142
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
MOM'S IN A BAD MOOD,

2143
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
EVERYBODY IS IN A BAD MOOD.

2144
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
YOU HAVE TO WATCH THAT.

2145
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
>> SO TRUE.
IF WE WORRY, THEY WORRY.

2146
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
IF WE'RE CALM, THEY'RE CALM.

2147
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
IF WE COME HOME TALKING

2148
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
ABOUT THAT PRINCIPAL,

2149
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
THEY'RE GOING TO UNDERSTAND

2150
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
COURAGE, YOU KNOW.

2151
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
WE OF COURSE HAVE TO FEEL

2152
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
THE FOR THE VICTIMS.

2153
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
THEN THERE IS THE ISSUE OF

2154
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
SURVIVES.
THERE WILL BE A VERY HIGH

2155
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
INCIDENCE OF POST-TRAMATIC

2156
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
STRESS DISORDER.

2157
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
MEGYN: WHAT ABOUT THAT?

2158
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
THEY WILL HAVE POST-TRAMATIC

2159
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
STRESS.

2160
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
WILL THE NATION HAVE

2161
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
POST-TRAMATIC STRESS.

2162
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
>> WE HAVE MORE CONTROL.

2163
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
THOSE CHILDREN WILL HAVE IT.

2164
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
THEY WILL FEEL SAD.

2165
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
THEY WILL FEEL ANGRY.

2166
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
THEY WON'T FEEL THEMSELVES

2167
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
FOR A LONG TIME.

2168
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
SURVIVORS OF COLUMBINE BIND

2169
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
ARE NEVER THEMSELVES.

2170
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
THEY HAVE FLASHBACKS.

2171
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
THE NATION CAN CONTROL WHAT

2172
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
WE HAVE IT IS NOT OUR

2173
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
CHILDREN.

2174
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
WE CAN FEEL COMPASSION AND

2175
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
CARING AND IT IS NOT OUR

2176
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
CHILDREN.

2177
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
AS LONG AS IT IS NOT WE CAN

2178
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF

2179
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS WE

2180
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
HAVE.

2181
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
THERE IS PHENOMENON CALLED

2182
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
VICARIOUS TRAUMATIC STRESS

2183
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
DISORDER.

2184
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
WE CAN GET IT FROM WATCHING

2185
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000

01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000

01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
THE WAY THEY'RE BRINGING

2205
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
PEOPLE TOGETHER.

2206
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
THE LOVE AND OUTPOURING AND

2207
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
CARE FROM THE U.S..

2208
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

2209
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
STATES'S REACTION TO THIS,

2210
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
ALL OF THE REACTIONS ON A

2211
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
POSITIVE NOTE OF COMPASSION

2212
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
AND CARING COMING INTO THE

2213
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
CHRISTMAS SEASON, THE

2214
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
HANUKKAH SEASON THAT'S WHAT

2215
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
WE NEED.
MEGYN: YOU CAN'T SKIP PAST

2216
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
THE GRIEF.

2217
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
YOU CAN'T DO THAT NOTHING

2218
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
WILL CHANGE.
WE WON'T TAKE A CLOSE LOOK

2219
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
HOW THIS HAPPENED.
THEN YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON

2220
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
FROM IT.

2221
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
>> WELL, MEGYN, I WANT TO

2222
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
SAY, THIS IS A SERIES OF

2223
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
TERRIBLE PERSONAL TRAGEDIES.

2224
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
IT IS NOT A NATIONAL

2225
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
TRAGEDY.
IT IS A PERSONAL TRAGEDY.

2226
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT,

2227
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
DOC.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

2228
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
>> IT IS A NATIONAL TRAGEDY

2229
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
IN THE SENSE WE'RE MOURNING

2230
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
FOR THEM.

2231
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
MEGYN: IN A SENSE SEEMS LIKE

2232
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
THE WORLD GOT A LITTLE

2233
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
DARKER ON FRIDAY.

2234
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT

2235
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
DIDN'T HAPPEN TO US.

2236
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
WE DIDN'T LOSE CHILDREN,

2237
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
THANK GOD.
THE FACT THAT THERE IS, I

2238
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
DON'T KNOW EVEN IF I KNOW I

2239
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
WANT TO SAY EVIL.

2240
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS

2241
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
YOUNG MAN WAS EVIL OR SO

2242
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
DISTURBED THAT HE DID AN

2243
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
EVIL THING AND WENT TO AN

2244
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
EVIL PLACE.

2245
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
THAT IS FOR THE

2246
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
PSYCHIATRISTS TO FIGURE OUT.

2247
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
BUT I MEAN, IT JUST SEEMS

2248
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
LIKE WE LOST A HAIL BIT OF

2249
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
OURSELVES SOMEHOW ON FRIDAY.

2250
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
A RED LINE WAS CROSSED AS

2251
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
DR. ABLOW SAID WE DIDN'T

2252
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
THINK COULD BE CROSSED.

2253
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000

PSYCHIATRIC DISTURBANCE.

01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

2259
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000

SOME JEWISH GROUPS IS

2329
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
MR. HAGEL'S PAST HOSTILITY

01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
TOWARDS ISRAEL AND ITS

01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
CHUCK HAGEL'S PERCEIVED

2339
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
HOSTILITY TOWARD ISRAEL AND

2340
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
SAYING IT WOULD BE A

2341
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
TERRIBLE APPOINTMENT AND

2342
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
APPARENTLY MOST OF THE

2343
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
JEWISH LEADERS WHO HAVE

2344
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
EXPRESSED THEMSELVES.

2345
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
WHY?
>> I THINK THEY HAVE LOOKED

2346
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
AT A NUMBER OF VOTES THAT

2347
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
SENATOR HAGEL TOOK DURING

2348
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
HIS TIME IN THE SENATE AND

2349
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
THEY'RE VERY WORRIED WHAT

2350
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
HIS POSITION ON ISRAEL,

2351
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
TERRORISM IN THE MIDDLE

2352
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
EAST.
DEALING WITH IRAN WOULD BE.

2353
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
LET ME SAY, I WOULD STERNLY

2354
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
DON'T BEAR SENATOR HAGEL ANY

2355
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
ILL WILL PERSONALLY.

2356
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
HE SUPPORTED BOTH OF MY

2357
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
NOMINATIONS IN THE BUSH

2358
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
ADMINISTRATION.

2359
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
HE GAVE ME A LOT OF GOOD

2360
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
ADVICE AND HELPED OUT BEHIND

2361
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
THE SCENES.

2362
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
SO I'M CERTAINLY PERSONALLY

2363
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR ALL OF

2364
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
THAT AND WHAT IS INTERESTING

2365
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
THIS CONTROVERSY APPEARS TO

2366
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
BE STARTING PRIMARILY AMONG

2367
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
DEMOCRATS.

2368
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
JEWISH DEMOCRATS, WHO ARE

2369
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
WORRIED ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL

2370
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
NOMINATION.

2371
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
MEGYN: WHAT SPECIFICALLY HAS

2372
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
CHUCK HAGEL DONE?

2373
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
HE IS A REPUBLICAN IN THE

2374
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
SENATE FOR 12 YEARS.

2375
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
HE WAS A MORE MODERATE

2376
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
REPUBLICAN, THAT REAL

2377
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
STAUNCH CONSERVATIVES NEVER

2378
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
MUCH LIKED HIM BECAUSE HE

2379
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
DIDN'T SORT OF VOTE ALONG

2380
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
THE PARTY LINE BUT WHAT

2381
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
SPECIFICALLY ON ISRAEL HAS

2382
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
HE SAID OR DONE THAT HASD ABOUT?

2383
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
>> AS I SAY HE VOTED ALONG

2384
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
PARTY LINES THAT I'M

2385
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
CERTAINLY GRATEFUL FOR.

2386
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
MEGYN: I SEE YOUR STANDARD.

2387
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
THIS IS GOOD TO KNOW ABOUT

2388
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
YOU.

2389
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
WE HAVE TO CHECK THE RECORD

2390
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
TO SEE IF THE LAWMAKERS

2391
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
VOTED FOR YOU.

2392
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
>> JUST WANTED TO GET THAT

2393
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
OUT THERE.

2394
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
IN 2007, THE HARDEST VOTE I

2395
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
THINK TO EXPLAIN IS THAT HE

2396
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
DECLINED TO VOTE THE IRANIAN

2397
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS CORPS

2398
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
AS A FOREIGN TERRORIST

2399
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
ORGANIZATION.
THAT WAS THE VERY TIME THE

2400
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
IRGC WAS ARMING AND EQUIPING

2401
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
SHIITE TERRORISTS IN IRAQ

2402
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
WHO WERE ATTACKING AMERICAN

2403
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
AND OTHER COALITION FORCES

2404
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
WHEN IRGC PEOPLE WERE

2405
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
TRAINING AND ARMING AND

2406
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
FINANCING HEZBOLLAH IN

2407
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
LEBANON, AND THE LIST GOES

2408
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
ON AND ON.

2409
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
SO I THINK THIS IS, PEOPLE

2410
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF

2411
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THAT

2412
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
MEANS FOR THE ENTIRE OBAMA

2413
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
ADMINISTRATION POLICY.
AND I THINK, THE FACT THAT

2414
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
SO MUCH OF THIS OPPOSITION,

2415
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
THESE QUESTIONS, THAT ARE

2416
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
BEING RAISED, COME FROM

2417
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
STRONG DEMOCRATIC PARTY

2418
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
SUPPORTERS MAY WELL THROW A

2419
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
WRENCH INTO THE WHITE HOUSE

2420
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
PLANS TO HAVE A PACKAGE

2421
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE NEW

2422
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM IN

2423
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

2424
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
MEGYN: COULD THIS BE, COULD

2425
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
THIS BE A DEAL BREAKER?

2426
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
COULD HE ACTUALLY NOT GET

2427
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
THE NECESSARY SUPPORT?

2428
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S TOO

2429
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
EARLY TO SAY THAT.

2430
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
ALTHOUGH, I'M VERY SURPRISED

2431
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
AT THE LEVEL OF, OF

2432
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
OPPOSITION ALREADY BEING

2433
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
VOICED.

2434
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
AND A LOT DEPENDS HOW

2435
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
REPUBLICANS INCLUDING

2436
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
SENATOR McCAIN, DECIDE

2437
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
THEY'RE GOING TO GO.

2438
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
YOU KNOW, HE AND SENATOR

2439
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
HAGEL WERE BOTH VIETNAM

2440
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
VETERANS.

2441
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
THEY WERE CLOSE IN THE

2442
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
SENATE.
AND YET, SENATOR HAGEL

2443
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
ENDORSED PRESIDENT OBAMA IN

2444
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
2008.

2445
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
HE DID NOT ENDORSE SENATOR

2446
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
McCAIN.

2447
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I DON'T, BELIEVE ME, I DON'T

2448
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
THINK SENATOR McCAIN WOULD

2449
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
REACT OUT OF PERSONAL PIQUE.

2450
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I DON'T THINK THAT DROVE HIS

2451
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
CONCERN ABOUT SUSAN RICE AND

2452
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD DRIVE

2453
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
THE POSITION ON CHUCK HAGEL.

2454
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
A LOT OF REPUBLICANS LOOK TO

2455
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
SENATOR McCAIN, IF THE

2456
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
NOMINATION OCCURS, WE'RE IN

2457
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
THE PHASE TALKING ABOUT

2458
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
NOMINATIONS THAT HAVEN'T

2459
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
OCCURRED AGAIN, BUT IF IT

2460
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
WERE TO OCCUR I THINK

2461
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
SENATOR McCAIN'S POSITION

2462
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
COULD BE PIVOTAL.
MEGYN: QUICKLY BEFORE I LET

2463
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
YOU GO I DIDN'T HEAR YOUR

2464
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
REACTION TO SUSAN RICE

2465
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
OFFICIALLY OUT AS POSSIBLE

2466
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE?

2467
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
>> IT IS A GREAT PERSONAL

2468
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
DISAPPOINTMENT FOR HER AND

2469
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
WHEN YOU GO INTO MEETINGS

2470
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
WITH SENATORS AND COME OUT

2471
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
WITH THEM HAVING MORE

2472
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
QUESTIONS THAN WHEN YOU WENT

2473
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
IN IT'S A REAL PROBLEM IN A

2474
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
CONFIRMATION PROCESS.

2475
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I THINK THE PRESIDENT
DECIDED IT WASN'T WORTH THE

2476
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
POLITICAL COST TO HIM.

2477
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
HE HAS 55 DEMOCRATS IN THE

2478
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
SENATE.
IF HE HAD REALLY WANTED TO

2479
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
PUSH IT THROUGH I THINK HE

2480
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED.

2481
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
SO THE CALCULUS WAS THE

2482
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
PRESIDENT'S TO MAKE IT

2483
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
WASN'T POLITICALLY WORTH IT.

2484
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
MEGYN: THAT IS WIDELY

2485
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
BELIEVED SENATOR KERRY WILL

2486
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
ASSEND TO THAT POSITION.

2487
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
AMBASSADOR BOLTON, THANKS

2488
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000

01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
KNOW, SHE WOULD TAKE THEM

THAT I THINK HE ENJOYED, AND SO,

2566
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
YOU KNOW, SHE USED THE

2567
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT WITH HIM,

2568
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
YOU KNOW?
SO THAT SHE COULD HAVE SOME

2569
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
QUALITY TIME WITH HER SON.

2570
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000

2584
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR BEING

2585
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
HERE.

2586
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
>> WHERE YOU'RE WELCOME.

2587
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
MEGYN: APPRECIATE IT.

2588
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
LET ME START WITH YOU, REBECCA.

2589
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
>> SURE.

2590
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
MEGYN: THERE WAS A PIECE POSTED

2591
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
ONLINE, I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T

2592
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
LOOKED AT THIS, BUT IT'S CALLED

2593
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I AM ADAM LANZA'S MOTHER, AND

2594
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
IT'S WRITTEN BY A WOMAN -- IT'S

2595
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
NOT, OBVIOUSLY, HIS MOTHER, BUT

2596
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
SHE TALKS ABOUT HOW SHE HAS A

2597
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
SON WHO TERRIFIES HER.

2598
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,000
AUTISM SPECTRUM, ADHD, OPTIONAL

2599
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
DEFINAL, EXPLOSIVE DISORDER.

2600
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
SHE BASICALLY SAYS SHE'S AFRAID

2601
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
OF HER SON.

2602
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S

2603
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
WRONG WITH HIM, BUT SHE DOESN'T

2604
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
FEEL THERE IS A PLACE RIGHT NOW

2605
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
IN SOCIETY TO GET THE RIGHT

2606
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
HELP.
>> THE SERVICES.

2607
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
MEGYN: THE SERVICES.

2608
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
YOUR THOUGHTS.

2609
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
>> MY THOUGHTS ARE THERE ARE SO

2610
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
MANY COMORBID SITUATIONS IN SOME

2611
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
OF THESE KIDS WITH AUTISM --

2612
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
MEGYN: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT,

2613
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
COMORBID?

2614
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:49,000
>> COMORBID MEANS YOU COULD HAVE

2615
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,000
ADHD, YOU CAN HAVE OPPOSITIONAL

2616
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
DEFIANCE DISORDER.

2617
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I COULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN THAT

2618
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
ARTICLE BECAUSE MY SON IS NOT,

2619
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
DOES NOT HAVE MELTDOWNS AND IS

2620
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
NOT VIOLENT, BUT MY SON PROBABLY

2621
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
COULD HAVE, WELL, WE WERE ABLE

2622
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
TO ACCESS THE RIGHT SERVICES

2623
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
VERY YOUNG, AND HE GOT THOSE

2624
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
IMPULSES UNDER CONTROL.

2625
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:13,000
AND WHAT WE DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW

2626
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
IS ENOUGH INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT

2627
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
ADAM, WHAT WAS GOING ON, HOW

2628
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
MANY SERVICES.

2629
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW TRULY WHAT

2630
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
HIS CORRECT DIAGNOSE KNOW CEASE

2631
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
IS.
MEGYN: AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE

2632
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS AT

2633
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
ALL BECAUSE THE BROTHER, RYAN

2634
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
LANZA, REPORTEDLY TOLD THE

2635
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
POLICE THAT HIS BROTHER SUFFERED

2636
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
FROM -- WAS ON THE AUTISM

2637
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
SPECTRUM, AND HE REPORTEDLY USED

2638
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
THE WORD AS ASPERGER'S WHICH IS

2639
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
SORT OF CONSIDERED ON THE AUTISM

2640
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
SPECTRUM BUT MAYBE NOT FOR MUCH

2641
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
LONGER.
IN ANY EVENT, SO MANY PEOPLE,

2642
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
DOCTOR, SOMETHING OVER 1.5

2643
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
MILLION HAVE ASPERGER'S OR HAVE

2644
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
AUTISM IN THIS COUNTRY.

2645
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
>> UH-HUH.

2646
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
MEGYN: 99 PERCENT OF THEM COMMIT

2647
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
NO VIOLENT CRIME.

2648
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
SHOULD WE EVEN BE TALKING ABOUT

2649
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
THIS?

2650
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
>> YES, I THINK WE SHOULD

2651
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
BECAUSE, ONE, I THINK WE'VE

2652
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
IGNORED THESE PROBLEMS FOR TOO

2653
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
LONG.

2654
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
ALTHOUGH THIS IS AN UNFORTUNATE

2655
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
SITUATION, IT'S BRINGING UP A

2656
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT

2657
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
SOMETHING THAT I THINK HAS BEEN

2658
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
IGNORED BY THIS COUNTRY FOR WAY

2659
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
TOO LONG.

2660
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
WE'VE BEEN SPENDING SO MUCH TIME

2661
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
TALKING ABOUT POLITICS AND THE

2662
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,000
ECONOMY, AND WE'VE FORGOTTEN

2663
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
ABOUT OUR CHILDREN.

2664
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
WE'RE LITERALLY SEEING AN

2665
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
EPIDEMIC OF THESE ISSUES RIGHT

2666
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
NOW.
THESE ARE NEUROLOGICAL

2667
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
PROBLEMS --

2668
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
MEGYN: THESE ARE NOT MENTAL

2669
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
ILLNESSESES, RIGHT?
>> NO.

2670
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
IT'S A NEUROLOGICAL PROBLEM.

2671
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
AND IN MANY WAYS, YOU KNOW, IT

2672
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
CAN BE PREVENTED, IT CAN BE

2673
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
TREATED EFFECTIVELY.

2674
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
BUT MOST KIDS I DON'T THINK ARE

2675
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
GETTING THE PROPER RESOURCES

2676
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
THAT THEY NEED.

2677
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
AND I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, IT'S

2678
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF THAT

2679
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED.

2680
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,000
MEGYN: JOHN GILMOUR, THEY SAID

2681
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
THIS MOM, NANCY, DECIDED TO HOME

2682
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
SCHOOL HIM FOR SOME PERIOD OF

2683
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
TIME BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T FEEL

2684
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
LIKE SHE WAS GETTING THE SUPPORT

2685
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
SHE NEEDED UNLIKE REBECCA.

2686
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
IT, OBVIOUSLY, SHE WAS NOT AS

2687
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
SUPPORTED AS SHE NEEDED TO BE.

2688
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
THAT SEEMS TO BE CLEAR TO US.

2689
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

2690
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
>> WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY NOT

2691
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
UNUSUAL FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE

2692
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
CHILDREN ON AUTISM SPECTRUM TO

2693
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
HOME SCHOOL THEM.

2694
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
MANY PUBLIC SCHOOLS AREN'T

2695
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
REALLY EQUIPPED TO PROVIDE

2696
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
APPROPRIATE SETTING OR EDUCATION

2697
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
FOR CHILDREN WITH AUTISM.

2698
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE, YOU KNOW,

2699
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
WITH THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING

2700
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
ABOUT A YOUNG MAN, AND WHEN THEY

2701
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
GET TO THEIR 20s, THERE'S A

2702
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
COMPLETE EVAPORATION OF

2703
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
SERVICES.

2704
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
MEGYN: RIGHT.
BECAUSE THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THE

2705
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
SCHOOL SYSTEM FOR ALL THOSE

2706
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
YEARS, AND THERE'S BEEN SUPPORT,

2707
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
AND THEN SUDDENLY IT'S GONE.

2708
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

2709
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
WE TALK ABOUT IT IN OUR

2710
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
COMMUNITY AS THE DAY THE BUS

2711
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
STOPS SHOWING UP.

2712
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
MEGYN: AND WHAT'S THE GENERAL

2713
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
CONSENSUS ON THAT?

2714
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
>> WELL, A LOT OF FEAR AND, YOU

2715
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
KNOW, AT LEAST FOR SOME OF US

2716
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AS MUCH

2717
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
AS WE CAN TO SORT OF IMPROVE THE

2718
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
SITUATION.
YOU KNOW, ONE THING STRUCK ME

2719
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
ABOUT THIS, THOUGH, IS THAT I

2720
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
THINK IT KIND OF

2721
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
MISCHARACTERIZES PEOPLE ON THE

2722
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
AUTISTIC SPECTRUM -- IF HE

2723
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
WAS --

2724
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
MEGYN: RIGHT.

2725
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
UNCONFIRMED STILL.
>> RIGHT.

2726
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
ANOTHER UNCONFIRMED REPORT WAS

2727
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
THAT HE WAS TAKING A VERY

2728
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:09,000
POWERFUL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG.

2729
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
NOW, THAT WOULD SEEM TO

2730
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
INDICATE -- WHICH IS NOT

2731
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
RECOMMENDED FOR AUTISM OR

2732
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
ASPERGER'S.
SO THAT WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE

2733
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
THERE'S OTHER ISSUES GOING ON

2734
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
WITH THIS YOUNG MAN BEFORE THIS

2735
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
HAPPENED.
MEGYN: MICHAEL JOHN, YOUR

2736
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
THOUGHTS ON THE REPORTS OF THE

2737
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
GUNS BEING IN THE HOME.

2738
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS A GUN

2739
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
DISCUSSION, BUT THE MOTHER WAS A

2740
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
GUN ENTHUSIAST WHICH, YOU KNOW,

2741
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
THAT'S LEGAL IN THIS COUNTRY,

2742
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
BUT IS THERE HEIGHTENED CONCERN

2743
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
FOR KEEPING THAT KIND OF WEAPON

2744
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
IN THE HOUSE IN YOUR VIEW WITH A

2745
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
CHILD THAT'S ON THE AUTISM

2746
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
SPECTRUM, OR, FORGET THAT, HAS

2747
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
JUST HAD THESE TYPE OF MENTAL

2748
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
ISSUES IN THEIR PAST?

2749
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
>> ARE WELL, JUST FOCUSING ON

2750
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
THE AUTISM SPECTRUM ASPECT OF

2751
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
IT, I WOULD SAY, NO, IT'S NOT

2752
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
NECESSARILY GOING TO PLAY A ROLE

2753
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
IN WHETHER OR NOT THE CHILD IS

2754
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
GOING THE USE THOSE GUNS

2755
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
NECESSARILY.
FOLKS ON THE SPECTRUM SUCH AS

2756
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
MYSELF, SUCH AS MY SON, SUCH AS

2757
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
G.R.A.S.S. MEMBERS, WE DON'T

2758
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
LIKE AMBIGUITY TOO MUCH, WE

2759
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
DON'T LIKE, YOU KNOW,

2760
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
UNCERTAINTY IN LIFE.

2761
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
THE WORLD IS CONFUSING ENOUGH

2762
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
SOMETIMES.
SO RULES AND REGULATIONS,

2763
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE SAFETY

2764
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
VALVES, YOU KNOW?

2765
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
WE APPRECIATE THEM BECAUSE THEN

2766
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
EVERYTHING IS CLEAR.

2767
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
SO, YOU KNOW, USUALLY ON THE

2768
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
SPECTRUM YOU'RE GOING TO SEE

2769
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
MORE OF A PREPONDERANCE FOR AN

2770
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
INDIVIDUAL OBEYING THE LAW MAYBE

2771
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH RATHER

2772
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
THAN DISOBEYING THE LAW.

2773
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
MEGYN: DOCTOR, WHAT ARE THE

2774
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
OPTIONS FOR A MOTHER LIKE THIS

2775
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
WHO, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER HIS

2776
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,000
ISSUE WAS, YOU KNOW, EXTREMELY

2777
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
WITHDRAWN, EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT

2778
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
BUT GROWING MORE AND MORE

2779
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
TROUBLED IN RECENT YEARS

2780
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS, ALL OF

2781
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
WHICH REMAINS CONFIRMED, BUT WE

2782
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
NEED TO GET THIS OUT THERE

2783
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
BECAUSE ALREADY THE DISCUSSION

2784
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
ABOUT THESE THINGS IS OUT THERE,

2785
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS FOR SUCH A

2786
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
MOTHER?

2787
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
>> YEAH.

2788
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
THERE ARE OPTIONS OUT THERE

2789
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
OTHER THAN JUST THROWING

2790
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
MEDICATION AT KIDS WHICH REALLY,

2791
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
AGAIN, MAY OR MAY NOT BE

2792
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
APPROPRIATE.
BUT IT'S NOT THE LONG-TERM

2793
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
ANSWER, WE FOE THAT.

2794
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
THERE ARE -- WE KNOW THAT.

2795
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
WE HAVE BRAIN BALANCE CENTERS

2796
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
WHICH ARE OUT THERE --

2797
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
MEGYN: WHERE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR

2798
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,000
CHILD TESTED AND GET A

2799
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
MEANINGFUL DIAGNOSIS BACK?

2800
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
>> WHERE WE CAN WORK WITH THE

2801
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,000
PROBLEM.
IT'S NOT ABOUT LABELING, BECAUSE

2802
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
EVERYBODY IS DIFFERENT, EVERY

2803
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
CHILD IS DIFFERENT.

2804
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
THEY MAY FOLLOW THE RULES, BUT

2805
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
THEN THERE MAY BE OTHERS THAT

2806
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
HAVE NO EMPATHY, THAT REALLY

2807
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
DON'T FEEL MUCH IN THE WAY OF

2808
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,000
PAIN OR COMPASSION AND MAY BE

2809
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
PRONE TO ANGER AND OUTBURST, SO

2810
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
THERE ARE ALL DIFFERENT TYPES.

2811
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM IS THE

2812
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
SAME.

2813
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
THERE ARE NEUROLOGICAL

2814
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
IMBALANCES, AND WE CAN DEAL WITH

2815
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
THESE WITH MULTIMODAL

2816
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
TREATMENTS, DIFFERENT

2817
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
THERAPISTS, PHYSICAL THERAPY,

2818
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
BEHAVIORAL THERAPY, NUTRITION.

2819
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
ALL OF THAT IS VERY, VERY

2820
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
IMPORTANT.

2821
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000
THERE'S A LOT OF OPTIONS OUT

2822
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
THERE.
MEGYN: AND YET OUTBURSTS, JUST

2823
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000

WHO'S ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM

2825
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING ABOUT

2826
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO BE

2827

2830
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000

2836

A TANTRUM. -- REMITTED AS A

2837
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
TANTRUM.
MEGYN: REBECCA, THE MESSAGE WE

2838
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
NEED TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS?

2839
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
>> I FEEL HORRIBLE ABOUT THE

2840
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
SITUATION, I THINK, UM, THE

2841
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
REASON MY SON GOT THE SERVICES

2842
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,000
HE NEEDED WAS BECAUSE I WAS

2843
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
TENACIOUS.
MY HUSBAND AND I HIRED AN

2844
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
ATTORNEY TO MAKE SURE HE GOT THE

2845
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
SERVICES HE NEEDED.
I KNOW THAT MOST OF THE PARENTS

2846
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
OUT THERE CAN'T DO THAT, BUT

2847
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
THEY CAN LOOK INTO FREE

2848
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000

2849
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000

2851
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
THAT THINGS LIKE THIS NEVER

2852
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE.

2853
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
MEGYN: GOT TO BE A MOTHER

2854
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000

2855
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
THANK YOU ALL.

2857

THERE

2858
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,000
So now I can be in
the scene.

2859
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
ADVAIR is
clinically proven to help

2860
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
significantly improve

2861
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
lung function.

2862
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Unlike most COPD medications,

2863
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
ADVAIR contains both an
anti-inflammatory

2864
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
and a
long-acting bronchodilator

2865
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,000
working together to help improve
your lung function all day.

2866
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
ADVAIR won't
replace fast-acting inhalers

2867
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
for sudden symptoms

2868
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
and should not be used more
than twice a day.

2869
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
People with
COPD taking ADVAIR

2870
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
may have a higher chance
of pneumonia.

2871
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
ADVAIR may increase your
risk of osteoporosis

2872
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
and some eye problems.

2873
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Tell your doctor
if you have a heart condition

2874
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,000
or high blood pressure before
taking ADVAIR.

2875
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
If you're still
having difficulty breathing,

2876
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
ask your doctor if including
ADVAIR could help

2877
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
improve your lung function.

01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
CONNECTICUT, AND EVEN IF SHE

2923
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
TOOK -- THE MOTHER -- EVEN IF

2924
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
SHE TOOK HER SON, AN UNLICENSED

2925
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
GUN OWNER, TO A SHOOTING RANGE,

2926
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME REPORTS SHE

2927
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
MAY HAVE LET HIM SHOOT, EVEN IF

2928
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
SHE DID ALL OF THOSE THINGS,

2929
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
MEGYN, THAT'S PERFECTLY LEGAL

2930
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
UNDER CONNECTICUT LAW TO TAKE

2931
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE A

2932
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
LICENSE AND LET THEM SHOOT AT A

2933
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
RANGE.

2934
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
MEGYN: MARK, WHEN I READ UP

2935
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
ABOUT THIS, THEY SAID THAT

2936
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
CONNECTICUT'S GUN LAWS ARE THE

2937
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:04,000
FOURTH MOST STRICT IN THE

2938
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
COUNTRY.
>> YEAH.

2939
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
LIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

2940
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
IF WE'RE ANALYZING HER SPECIFIC

2941
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
BEHAVIOR, WE TRACE FIRST HER

2942
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
CHOICE TO LET HER SON SHOOT

2943
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
WEAPONS WITH HER, AND LIS IS

2944
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
AS LONG AS SHE IMMEDIATELY

2945
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
SUPERVISED AN UNLICENSED GUN

2946
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
HANDLER, SHE'S ALLOWED TO DO

2947
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
THAT.
MEGYN: OKAY, BUT WAIT.

2948
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
BEFORE WE GET TO THAT, HOLD ON,

2949
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,000
HOLD ON, BEFORE WE GET TO THAT,

2950
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
SHE OWNED ALL THE GUNS LEGALLY,

2951
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,000
CORRECT?

2952
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,000
>> CORRECT.

2953
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
MEGYN: OKAY.
AND SHE JUMPED THROUGH ALL THE

2954
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
HOOPS SHE NEEDED TO.

2955
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
SHE DID ALL THAT, SHE PASSED ALL

2956
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
THAT, SHE HAD THESE WEAPONS

2957
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,000
LEGALLY.
>> YES.

2958
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
MEGYN: OKAY.

2959
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
BUT NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO THE

2960
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S

2961
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
ANY RESTRICTION ON HAVING SUCH A

2962
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
GUN IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY IN YOUR

2963
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,000
HOUSE LIKE THIS SON WHO,

2964
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
WHOSE -- WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

2965
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
WHAT HE WAS SUFFERING FROM, LIS.

2966
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
>> WELL, THAT'S THE PROBLEM, WE

2967
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
DON'T HAVE A DIAGNOSIS YET.

2968
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY, IF SHE

2969
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
KNEW THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO COMMIT

2970
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
AN ACT OF VIOLENCE, IF THERE'S

2971
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,000
SOMETHING ON THE COMPUTERRER --

2972
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
WE'LL NEVER KNOW, EXAIVEL, WHAT

2973
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
THEIR CONVERSATION WAS, BUT IF

2974
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,000
THERE WAS SOMETHING ON ON THE

2975
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,000
COMPUTER, IF THERE WERE NOTES OR

2976
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHERE SHE

2977
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
HAD CAUSE TO BELIEVE HE WAS

2978
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,000
GOING TO GO OUT AND SHOOT UP

2979
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
THAT SCHOOL, THEN THERE'S AN

2980
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
ISSUE THERE.

2981
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
BUT JUST THE FACT THE KID HAS

2982
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
SOME MENTAL PROBLEMS AND SHE'S

2983
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
GOT THE GUNS LEGALLY, THE MOST

2984
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,000
YOU COULD GO FOR IS CHILD

2985
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
ENDANGERMENT, HER CHILD.
MEGYN: IT LOOKS LIKE, OBVIOUSLY,

2986
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
THE MOTHER IS DECEASED, SO THIS

2987
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
IS A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION ABOUT

2988
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:28,000
WHAT THE OBLIGATIONS ARE OF

2989
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
WHETHER OR

2990
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
WHETHER OR

2991
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,000
PARENTS WHO HAVE CHILDREN IN

2992
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
THEIR HOME WITH MENTAL HEALTH

2993
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
ISSUES.
POSSESSION OF A FIREARM IS

2994
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
REGULATED BOTH BY FEDERAL LAW

2995
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,000
AND THAT OF 45 STATES, BUT IT

2996
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
ONLY APPLIES TO THE PERSON

2997
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
APPLYING.
SO YOU CAN HAVE SOMEBODY IN YOUR

2998
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
HOUSE THEN IN ALMOST ALL STATES

2999
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
WHO IS, WHO'S BEEN DIAGNOSED AS

3000
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
MENTALLY ILL, WHO MAY BE A

3001
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,000
SCHIZOPHRENIC, AND YOU CAN HAVE

3002
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
A GUN IN THE HOUSE?

3003
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
>> YES.

3004
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST

3005
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
THAT HE EVER HAD ANY OF THOSE

3006
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
WEAPONS IN HIS HANDS WITHOUT HER

3007
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
SUPERVISION AT A GUN RANGE, AND

3008
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
SO MERELY SAYING THAT SOMEBODY

3009
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
HAS MENTAL ILLNESSES DOESN'T

3010
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT'S

3011
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
REASONABLY FORESEEABLE THAT

3012
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
THEY'RE GOING TO GAIN ACCESS TO

3013
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
GUNS AND THEN GO OUT AND DO THIS

3014
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
HORRIFIC ACT.

3015
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
>> AND THAT'S, THAT'S WHAT WE

3016
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
NEED TO FIND OUT, MEGYN, IN THE

3017
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
ENSUING DAYS, FIND OUT WHAT DID

3018
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
SHE KNOW AND WHEN.

3019
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
COMPUTERS, NOTES --

3020
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
>> IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO DO

3021
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
NOW.
>> WELL, I KNOW, BUT MARK'S

3022
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
EXACTLY RIGHT, IS IT LEGAL?

3023
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
YES.
MEGYN: YEAH.

3024
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
AND IT'S NOT ILLEGAL FOR

3025
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:35,000
SOMEBODY WITH AS ASPERGER'S TO

3026
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
BE IN A HOME WITH GUNS.

3027
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000

3028
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,000
WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES.

3029
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000

01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,000
