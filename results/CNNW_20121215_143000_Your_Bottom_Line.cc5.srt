THREE GUNS, WORE FATIGUES AND

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
HAD A MILITARY VEST ON.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
HE GOT THE GUNS FROM HIS MOTHER.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000

RIGHT NOW.
PARENTS AND TEACHERS, I THINK IT

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
IS FAIR TO SAY THE ENTIRE NATION

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
IS STRUGGLING WITH HOW TO REALLY

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
UNDERSTAND HOW A GUNMAN COULD

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000

CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO HAVE

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
THAT CONVERSATION.

DR. FISHER, I APPRECIATE YOU

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
TALKING TO US.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO I TALKED

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
TO A FIRST AND THIRD GRADER.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY SAID

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
TO ME IS THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
WHAT TO DO.
THEY HAVE BEEN LETTING THE KIDS

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
DICTATE HOW MUCH THEY TALK OR

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
HOW MUCH NOT TO TALK, BUT NOW

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THAT THEY KNOW SOME OF THEIR

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
FIRST GRADERS' BEST FRIENDS HAVE

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
BEEN MASSACRED, THEY JUST DON'T

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE THEM TO

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
DO?
>> WELL, I THINK YOU DO IN SOME

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
WAYS LET YOUR CHILD TAKE THE

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
LEAD AND ASK THEM WHAT THEY KNOW

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
AND WHAT THEY ARE AWARE OF.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
WHEN PEOPLE EXPERIENCE TRAUMA,

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
IT IS NOT OFTEN STORED IN THE

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
VERBAL CENTERS OF THE BRAIN BUT

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
THE NON-VERBAL CENTER OF THE

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
BRAIN.
AS KIDS WORK THIS THROUGH, THEY

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
COULD HAVE A LOT OF EMOTION BUT

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
NOT HAVE WORDS.

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
A LOT OF TIMES WE HAVE EMOTIONS

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
BEFORE WE HAVE WORDS.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
AND WE HAVE TO SEE THAT

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
EVERYBODY WORKS THROUGH THEIR

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
GRIEF AND EMOTION DIFFERENTLY.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DRAW, TO

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
WRITE, TO COLOR, TO PAINT, TO

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
SING THROUGH THEIR HEALING

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
PROCESS.
AT THIS TIME, THOUGH, ANYBODY

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
WHOSE BEEN IN THIS EXPERIENCE IS

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
GOING TO NEED SOME PROFESSIONAL

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
HELP AND SUPPORT.

116
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
THAT'S JUST AN ABSOLUTE.

117
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
SO THE SOONER THEY CAN GET TO

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
SOMEBODY AND CONSULT WITH PEOPLE

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
WHO ARE EXPERTS AND

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
PROFESSIONALS IN THE AREA, THE

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000

122

RUN.

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
ALSO AS PARENTS, MAKE SURE

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
YOU'RE TAKING CARE OF

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
YOURSELVES, TOO.

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
IF YOUR KIDS SEE YOU WORN AND

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME, SOME OF

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
THAT IS GOING TO BE OKAY BECAUSE

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THEY WILL SEE THIS IS A HUMAN

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
EXPERIENCE.
HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
YOU HAVE AN OUTLET AS A PARENT

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
TO BE THERE TO SUPPORT YOUR KIDS

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE CONSULTING

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
A PROFESSIONAL IF YOU NEED THAT.

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
TOO.

BE VERY SUBTLE THINGS.

AND TEMPER TANTRUMS.

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
SOMETHING THAT SEEMS UNUSUAL,

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
BUT OFTENTIMES IT COULD BE MORE

THING, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000

DID NOT GO THROUGH THE TRAUMA,

WATCHING THE STORY UNFOLD FROM

LIE BUT YOU ALSO WANT TO GIVE

186
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
THEM REASSURANCE.

187
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
WHAT DO YOU DO?

188
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
>> I'M CAREFUL TO NOT MAKE

189
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
PROMISES.

190
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I NEVER TELL MY 7-YEAR-OLD

191
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
DAUGHTER I PROMISE BECAUSE WE

192
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
CANNOT MAKE PROMISES OVER THINGS

193
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
WE DO NOT CONTROL.

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I REALLY TRY TO SAY THIS IS WHAT

195
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
WE ARE DOING AND THESE ARE THE

196
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
PLANS I HAVE.

197
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE AN

198
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
EMERGENCY PLAN IF YOU GET

199
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
SEPARATED, WHAT'S YOUR EMERGENCY

200
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
CALL AND WHERE'S A SAFE PLACE TO

201
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
GO THAT'S A MEETING PLACE OR

202
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
THINGS LIKE THAT.
THOSE ARE THINGS IMPORTANT TO

203
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
HAVE IN PLACE.
BECAUSE THE MORE PEOPLE FEEL

204
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
LIKE THEY HAVE A PLAN, THE LESS

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
STRESS THAT OCCURS IN A

206
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
SITUATION IN THE LONG-TERM

207
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
STRESS.

208
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
DR. GUPTA MADE A GREAT POINT

209
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
ABOUT WATCHING SLEEP BECAUSE OF

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
THE STRESS HORMONES SECRETED

211
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
WHEN SLEEP DEPRIVED BUT YOU ARE

212
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
NOT JUST LOOKING HOW KIDS

213
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
RESPOND FOR THE NEXT MONTH OR

214
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
YEAR, BUT IN THE WORK OF PEOPLE

215
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
WITH TRAUMAS AS CHILDREN, WE ARE

216
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
TALKING ABOUT THE NEXT 20 YEARS.

217
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
EVEN IN THESE EVENTS, I HAVE HAD

218
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
TO CONSULT WITH CLIENTS TO SAY

219
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
TURN OFF THE TV.

220
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
DON'T WATCH IT AS THEY BRING UP

221
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
HUGE TRIGGERS FOR POST-TRAUMATIC

222
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
STRESS.
>> Reporter: IT IS SO

223
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
INTERESTING TO HEAR THE

224
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TEACHERS SO

225
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
CLEARLY HEROES.

226
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
HAVING THE CHILDREN HIDE IN

227
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
CUBBIES AND TRY TO PROTECT THEM

228
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
IN A WAY THAT WITH A GUNMAN

229
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
ROAMING AROUND, THEY CAN'T

230
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
REALLY PROTECT THEM IN DOING

231
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
THEIR ALL AND BEING ORGANIZED

232
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
AND BRINGING THEM TO THE

233
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
FIREHOUSE.
THAT'S AMAZING.

234
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
IS THAT A WAY TO FOCUS?

235
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
IT BREAKS MY HEART, IT IS SO

236
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
UPSETTING, BUT AT THE SAME TIME

237
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
IT FEELS LIKE ONE POSITIVE THING

238
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
IN THIS HORRIBLE THING IS PEOPLE

239
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
WERE TRULY HEROIC.

240
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
>> IT IS TOUGH TO TALK ABOUT,

241
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
BUT THE WHOLE NOTION OF

242
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
EMPOWERING YOURSELF IN SOME WAY.

243
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU SEEM TO

244
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
HAVE LOST COMPLETE CONTROL.

245
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
YOU HAVE NO LONGER TO DO

246
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
ANYTHING ALL TO EMPOWER YOURSELF

247
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
OR THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU.

248
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
IT MAY SEEM LIKE SMALL THINGS,

249
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
JUST SINGING SONGS TO THE

250
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
CHILDREN, HIDING IN CLOSETS, AND

251
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
NOT EVEN BEING SURE THOSE WILL

252
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN

253
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
TERMS OF PREVENTING THE HORROR,

254
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
BUT THAT EMPOWERMENT GOES A LONG

255
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
WAY AS SAYING, CONTROL YOUR OWN

256
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
FEELINGS BEFORE CONTROLLING

257
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
EVERY ONE'S FEELINGS.

258
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING THESE

259
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
STORIES ALL DAY.

260
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
>> Reporter: LET ME ASK YOU A

261
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
QUESTION, SANJAY, ABOUT WHAT A

262
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
FAMILY MEMBER OF THE SHOOTER,

263
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
ADAM LANZA TOLD INVESTIGATORS.

264
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
HE SAID THAT ADAM HADAUTISM.

265
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
MY NEPHEW IS AUTISTIC AND I HAVE

266
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
NEVER HEARD TO AUTISM BEING

267
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
LINKED TO THIS VIOLENT BEHAVIOR.

268
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
WE HAVE LINKED IT TO SMASZ

269
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
SHOOTINGS BEFORE BUT NOT AUTISM.

270
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
WHAT IS YOUR STUDY?

271
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
>> THERE ARE HARDLY ANY STUDIES

272
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
ON THIS, BUT THERE WERE A COUPLE

273
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
FROM A YEAR OR TWO AGO THA TO

274
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
SHOW THE LINK BETWEEN THIS AND

275
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
ANY KIND OF VIOLENT BEHAVIOR WAS

276
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
THE STUDIES DON'T BEAR THAT OUT.

277
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
VIOLENT OUTBURSTS LIKE ANY CHILD

278
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
OR YOUNG PERSON I HAVE ARE

279
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
THERE.
THERE ARE SOME STUDIES LOOKING

280
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
AT EMPATHY.

281
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
COULD THERE BE LIMITED EMPATHY?

282
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
BUT EVEN THE STUDIES ARE

283
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
LIMITED.

284
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I WILL SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, THE

285
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
DIAGNOSIS OF ASPERGERS IS NOT A

286
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
DIAGNOSIS.
AS OF THIS YEAR THAT DIAGNOSIS

287
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
IS GONE.

288
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
SO I GUESS I WOULDN'T REACH TOO

289
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
MUCH INTO THAT.

290
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
>> Reporter: AS WE ARE WAITING

291
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
FOR INFORMATION TO COME TO US,

292
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
ERIK FISHER, THANK YOU FOR

293
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
JOINING US THIS MORNING WITH

294
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
YOUR INSIGHT.
AND SANJAY, I APPRECIATE YOUR

295
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
TIME.
WE ARE WAITING FOR THIS PRESS

296
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
CONFERENCE.
THERE ARE NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU

297
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
SAY, LIKE 100 CAMERAS AT LEAST

298
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
HERE LINED UP FOR THE STATE

299
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
POLICE AND THE NEWTOWN POLICE

300
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
OFFICIALS TO COME OUT AND UPDATE

301
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
US ON THE VERY LATEST THAT THEY

302
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
KNOW.
WE ALSO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE

303
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
DETAIL FROM THE LIBRARIAN AT

304
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

305
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
SHE SAYS THE KIDS AND THE TEEN

306
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
TEACHERS WERE PREPARED ON WHAT

307
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
THEY COULD OVERHEAR OVER THE

308
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
INTERCOM.
SHE TALKED A FEW MOMENTS AGO ON

309
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
WHAT SHE DID TO KEEP KIDS SAFE

310
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
DURING THE SHOOTING SPREE.

311
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
LISTEN.
>> EVERYBODY DOES WHAT THEY HAVE

312
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
TO DO WHEN CONFRONTED IN A

313
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
SITUATION LIKE THAT.

314
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
AND EVERYBODY THAT WE PRACTICED

315
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
IT, AND THEY KNEW WHAT TO DO,

316
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
AND YOU JUST THINK ABOUT

317
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
PROTECTING THE KIDS AND JUST

318
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

319
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
>> Reporter: HOW LONG DID YOU

320
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
PRACTICE THIS?

321
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
>> WE HAVE LOCKDOWN DRILLS.

322
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MANY, BUT

323
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
THERE ARE RULES TO HAVE A

324
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
CERTAIN NUMBER A YEAR.

325
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
SO THE KIDS KNOW THE ROUTINE.

326
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
EVERYONE HAS A SPOT IN THE ROOM

327
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO GO

328
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
TO.

329
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
>> Reporter: CAN YOU DESCRIBE

330
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
THAT SPACE FOR US?
>> IN THE LIBRARY IT IS BETWEEN

331
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
A COUPLE BOOKCASES WITH NO

332
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
WINDOWS.

333
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
WE WENT INTO A BACK STORAGE ROOM

334
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
AND LOCKED THE KIDS IN THERE.

335
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
>> Reporter: HOW CLOSE WERE YOU

336
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
THERE?

337
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
>> WE WERE LIKE THIS CLOSE

338
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
TOGETHER.

339
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
THERE WAS CRAYONS AND PAPER THE

340
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
STORAGE ROOM IN THE BACK.

341
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
AND WE TORE SOME UP AND GAVE

342
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
THEM CLIPBOARDS AND HAD THEM

343
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
COLOR AND DRAW PICTURES.

344
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
THERE WERE THREE OTHER ADULTS

345
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
WITH ME.

346
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
THEY WERE ASKING WHAT'S GOING

347
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
ON, WE SAID WE DON'T KNOW.

348
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
OUR JOB IS TO STAY QUIET.

349
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
IT COULD BE A DRILL OR MAY NOT.

350
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
>> Reporter: YOU DIDN'T KNOW AT

351
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
THAT POINT?

352
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
>> WE KNEW BECAUSE I CALLED THE

353
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
OFFICE AND SHE TOLD ME THERE WAS

354
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
A SHOOTER.

355
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
>> MY KIDS, FRIENDS OF THEIRS

356
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
HAVE LITTLE SISTERS OR BROTHERS

357
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
DEAD.

358
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
EVERYBODY IN TOWN KNOWS

359
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
EVERYBODY.
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANYBODY

360
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
AFFECTED BY THIS.

361
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
IT IS AWFUL.

362
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'M JUST GLAD THEY WERE SAFE AND

363
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT ME

364
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
BECAUSE WE WERE IN LOCKDOWN AND

365
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
DIDN'T KNOW.

366
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
THE KIDS BACK HOME IN HIGH

367
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
SCHOOL WERE LEFT WATCHING IT ON

368
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
TV.

369
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000

460
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000

473

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
FACTS ARE THOROUGHLY KNOWN, THE

554
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
NRA HAS NO COMMENT."

555
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
THIS COMES FROM THE NATIONAL

556
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION.

557
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
ACTUALLY, BASED HERE.

558
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
THEY SAY THIS, CAN YOU SCROLL

559
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
DOWN AGAIN SO I TODAY THAT?

560
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
"OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THE

561
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
FAMILIES OF THIS HORRIBLE

562
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
TRAGEDY IN OUR COMMUNITY.
OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE FAMILIES,

563
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
THE COMMUNITY AND THE ONGOING

564
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
POLICE INVESTIGATION, IT WOULD

565
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
BE INAPPROPRIATE TO COMMENT."

566
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
SO FROM BOTH OF THEM, PRETTY

567
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
MUCH GETTING A BIG RESOUNDING NO

568
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
COMMENT AT THIS POINT.

569
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
WANT TO GET TO CALIFORNIA

570
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSWOMAN MARY

571
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
BONO MACK.

572
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK

573
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS THE LAST

574
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
YEAR ON MY MORNING PROGRAM.

575
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
YOU'RE A PARENT FIRST AND

576
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
FOREMOST.

577
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO WHAT HAS

578
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
UNFOLDED IN NEWTOWN,

579
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
CONNECTICUT?

580
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
>> HI, SOLEDAD.

581
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
THUNDERSTORM WATCH FOR HAVING ME

582
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
HERE.
MY RESPONSE -- THANK YOU FOR

583
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
HAVING ME HERE.

584
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
MY RESPONSE IS THE SAME AS EVERY

585
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
AMERICAN IS HAVING NOW, THAT IS

586
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
A BONE-CHILLING SADNESS.

587
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I THINK THAT WE ALL GRIEVE RIGHT

588
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
NOW.
I THINK THERE'S A PIECE OF EVERY

589
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
SINGLE PARENT RIGHT NOW WITH

590
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
THESE PARENTS AND THESE

591
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
FAMILIES.

592
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
AND YOU KNOW, YOU'VE DONE SUCH A

593
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
GREAT JOB ALREADY THIS MORNING

594
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
OF EXPLORING THE WHAT IFs AND

595
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
WHY NOT MY SCHOOL AND THANK GOD

596
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
IT'S NOT MY SCHOOL.

597
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
AND ALL OF THE PAIN AND

598
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
SUFFERING THAT WE'RE ALL FEELING

599
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
NOW.
AS WE WAIT FOR ANSWERS, WHY THIS

600
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
HORRIFIC THING HAPPENED, WHY WE

601
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
DECIDED -- HOW WE DECIDED AS A

602
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
DOWN MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE SURE

603
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

604
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
>> Reporter: WHAT DO YOU THINK

605
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
THAT MEANS?

606
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'M GOING TO WARN YOU, WE'RE

607
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
WAITING FOR THIS PRESS

608
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
CONFERENCE.
WE'VE BEEN WAITING ALL MORNING.

609
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I 1995 JUMP IN WHEN YOU'RE

610
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
TALKING AND JUST INTERRUPT FOR

611
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
THEIR START.

612
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
BUT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET.

613
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
SO WHAT DOES MEANINGFUL ACTION

614
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
MEAN?

615
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE?

616
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
YOU SUPPORT GUN RIGHTS IN THIS

617
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
COUNTRY.
YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN, AND I THINK

618
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
THAT'S A POSITION CONSISTENT

619
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
WITH MOST REPUBLICANS.

620
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
WHAT DOES MEANINGFUL ACTION,

621
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
THAT ACTUALLY STOPS THESE KINDS

622
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
OF SHOOTINGS, LOOK LIKE TO YOU?

623
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, I AM A

624
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
REPUBLICAN WHO HAS HAD
QUESTIONS, TOO, ABOUT A NUMBER

625
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE COME

626
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
BEFORE US ABOUT GUN RIGHTS AND

627
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
GUN CONTROL.

628
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
FOR EXAMPLE, COP KILLER BULLETS

629
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
OR, YOU KNOW, LARGE MAGAZINES.

630
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'VE ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS.

631
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
BUT WHERE I KEEP GETTING TO

632
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
REALLY QUICKLY IS THE MENTAL

633
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
HEALTH ISSUE.

634
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I KEEP WONDERING WHY THESE

635
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
PEOPLE SNAP.

636
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
ESPECIALLY IN THIS INSTANCE,

637
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
THERE -- THESE CHILDREN WERE, AS

638
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
SOMEBODY SAID TO ME EARLIER,

639
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
THEY WERE ANGELS.

640
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY

641
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
DEFENSELESS.
AND WHAT WOULD MAKE SOMEBODY

642
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
SNAP SO TERRIBLY TO DO SOMETHING

643
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
THIS HEINOUS?

644
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
SO THE QUESTION FOR ME IS NOT

645
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
JUST GUN RIGHTS BUT MENTAL

646
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
HEALTH.
I AGREE THAT I'VE NEVER HEARD

647
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
THIS ABOUT AUTISM.

648
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE WOULD BE

649
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
A LINK THERE.
BUT I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE

650
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
ARE LINK T-- LINKS TO MENTAL

651
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
HEALTH.
WE NEED TO DISCUSS WHAT WE CAN

652
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
DO BETTER IN THE MENTAL HEALTH

653
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
SYSTEM.
>> MAYBE THE ANSWER THEN IS BOTH

654
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
-- I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'RE

655
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
GOING TO GET A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

656
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
ARE GOING TO BE AGAINST GIVING

657
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
PEOPLE MORE MENTAL HEALTH

658
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
COUNSELING, ET CETERA, ET

659
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
CETERA.

660
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
SO I WOULD AGREE COMPLETELY ON

661
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
THAT FRONT.
LET'S GO BACK TO GUN CONTROL.

662
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BE DONE

663
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
TO MAKE PEOPLE SAFE?

664
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I MEAN, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

665
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
HAVE SAID, AND I THINK HONESTLY

666
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
HORRIBLY HAVE SAID THAT IF
PEOPLE WERE ARMED INSIDE THE

667
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
SCHOOL THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE

668
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
TO SHOOT THE SHOOTER.

669
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

670
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
>> WELL, YES.

671
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I MEAN, THAT IS ONE PORTION OF

672
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
IT I GUESS.

673
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
YOU KNOW, I THINK THOSE OF US

674
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
WHO FLY OFTEN KNOW THAT WE FEEL

675
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
SOME SORT OF CONSOLATION OR

676
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
SAFETY KNOWING THAT THERE MIGHT

677
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
BE AIR MARSHALS ON BOARD.

678
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETIMES IF

679
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
THERE'S SOMEBODY THERE WHO CAN

680
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
DEFEND YOU IN A SITUATION.

681
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THESE

682
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
INDIVIDUALS AND TO RECOGNIZE

683
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
THEY GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO HARM

684
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
OTHER PEOPLE.

685
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
WHAT LENGTHS ARE THEY GOING TO

686
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
GO TO IF GUNS AREN'T AT THEIR

687
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
DISPOSAL?
THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO THE NEXT

688
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
BEST THING WHETHER IT'S, YOU

689
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
KNOW, EXPLOSIVES OR PIPE BOMBS,

690
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
WHATEVER IT'S GOING TO BE.

691
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I MEAN, I SHUDDER TO THINK.

692
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE DERANGED OR

693
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
HAVE SNAPPED.
>> Reporter: ISN'T PART OF THE

694
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
ISSUE -- ISN'T PART OF THE ISSUE

695
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
THAT THERE'S EASY ACCESS?

696
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
WE DO KNOW THAT HIS MOTHER HAD

697
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
FIVE LEGALLY OBTAINED GUNS.

698
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
SHE WAS LICENSED FOR FIVE GUNS,

699
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
AT LEAST ONE OF THEM IS THIS

700
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
BUSH 223 -- BUSHMASTER RIFLE,

701
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
RIGHT?

702
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
A SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPON.

703
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
HE HAD EASY ACCESS TO THAT.

704
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
SO I FIND IT HARD WHEN PEOPLE

705
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
SAY, WELL, YOU KNOW, IF YOU

706
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
DIDN'T HAVE A GUN YOU COULD DO

707
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
SOMETHING ELSE.

708
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
IS THE ANSWER THEN ARMING MORE

709
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
PEOPLE?
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO

710
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
ME HONESTLY.
>> NO, BUT SOLEDAD, IT PROBABLY

711
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
DOESN'T.
BUT WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A

712
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
ROBUST DISCUSSION THAT INCLUDES

713
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
ALL OF THIS.

714
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
THE TALKS ABOUT GUN CONTROL,

715
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
ACCESS TO WEAPONS, AND MENTAL

716
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
HEALTH.

717
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
AND WHAT IT ALL MEANS.

718
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
YOU KNOW, THESE VICTIMS AND

719
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
THESE FAMILIES REALLY DESERVE A

720
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
VERY THOROUGH DISCUSSION.

721
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY -- I THINK

722
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
WE ALWAYS WANT THE QUICK AND

723
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
EASY ANSWER.
AND THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE GUN

724
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
CONTROL.
I DON'T KNOW.
RIGHT NOW I THINK -- I'M

725
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
GRIEVING TOO MUCH TO TRY TO

726
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
FIGURE IT OUT, YOU KNOW -- BUT

727
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
WE NEED A VERY THOROUGH --

728
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
>> Reporter: I DON'T KNOW THAT

729
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
PEOPLE WANT QUICK AND EASY

730
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
ANSWERS.
HONESTLY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

731
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
AND YOU AND I HAVE HAD MANY

732
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
CONVERSATIONS OVER THE PAST

733
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
YEAR.
WE TALK A LOT.

734
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS A

735
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
TRAGEDY, WE ALL RUN OUT AND

736
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
COVER IT.

737
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
AND PEOPLE WATCH AT HOME, AND

738
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
THEY'RE BROKEN HEARTED.

739
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
WE GO ON THE NEXT DAY OR THREE

740
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
WEEKS LATER AS IF, WELL, THAT'S

741
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
DONE.
THEN WE REVISIT THE ISSUE AGAIN

742
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
AT THE NEXT TRAGEDY.

743
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I GUARANTEE THE NEXT SCHOOL

744
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
SHOOTING WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT

745
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
GUN CONTROL AGAIN.
I WOULD PUT MONEY ON IT THAT

746
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
BETWEEN NOW AND THAT NEXT

747
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
SHOOTING NO ONE'S GOING TO DO

748
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
ANYTHING.
I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE SAYING

749
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
THAT.
NOTHING WILL BE DONE.

750
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
SO -- I JUST WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

751
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
WHAT TANGIBLE THINGS OUTSIDE OF

752
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHICH I

753
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
THINK ARE A VERY, VERY IMPORTANT

754
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
ONE, BUT LET'S TABLE THAT AND

755
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
FOCUS ON GUN CONTROL.

756
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
WHAT HAS TO CHANGE SO THAT

757
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
PEOPLE CAN'T GET ACCESS TO SEMI

758
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
ON AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND CAN GO

759
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
INTO A SCHOOL AND SHOOT UP A

760
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
BUNCH OF KIDS?

761
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
>> WELL, SOLEDAD, WITH ALL DUE

762
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
RESPECT, YOU KNOW, FIRST OF ALL,

763
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS SHOOTER.

764
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
WE KNOW HIS NAME.

765
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
WE DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT MORE.

766
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
IT'S BEEN 24 HOURS SINCE THIS

767
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
TRAGEDY.

768
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
WE'RE MAKING A LOT OF

769
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE SHOULDN'T

770
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
MAKE YET.

771
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I WOULD VENTURE TO GUESS THIS IS

772
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
A VERY DEEPLY TROUBLED
INDIVIDUAL.

773
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
YES, I WILL HAVE THAT DEBATE

774
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
WITH YOU.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE AS I'VE SAID --

775
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
>> Reporter: WE KNOW THE WEAPONS

776
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
HE USED.

777
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
WE KNOW THE WEAPONS HE USED.

778
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
WE KNOW THAT HE HAD THREE

779
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
WEAPONS AT LEAST ON HIM.

780
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
SO YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE IS TONS

781
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
TO KNOW.

782
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
WE'RE WAITING FOR A PRESS

783
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
CONFERENCE BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS

784
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
MORE TO KNOW ABOUT THIS YOUNG

785
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
MAN WHO IS 20 YEARS OLD.

786
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
BUT WE TO DOO KN-- WE DO KNOW H

787
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
AND KILLED PEOPLE.

788
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
HE DIDN'T STAB THEM.

789
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
HE SHOT THEM.
THIS CONVERSATION AT SOME POINT

790
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
HAS TO GO TO WHAT IS THE NORMAL

791
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
AMOUNT OF GUNS THAT PEOPLE CAN

792
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
OWN AND HOW THEY'RE REGISTERED

793
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
AND TRACKED.

794
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
WE JUST -- ANOTHERWISE Y -- OTH

795
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
WE'LL HAVE THIS SAME

796
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
CONVERSATION AT THE SAME

797
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.
I THINK YOU KNOW WE WILL, RIGHT?

798
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
>> I PRAY NOT.

799
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
OF COURSE, WE ALL PRAY THAT WE

800
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
-- NEVER AGAIN.

801
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
BUT SOLEDAD, YES, WE KNOW THAT

802
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
HE HAD THESE WEAPONS, BUT WE

803
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
HAVEN'T SEEN ANY TOXICOLOGY

804
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
RESULTS.
WE DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS USING,

805
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS ADDICTED

806
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
TO PILLS.

807
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
WE HAVE NO IDEA IF HE'S BEEN

808
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
SEEKING MENTAL COUNSELING.

809
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
WE DON'T KNOW THOSE ANSWERS YET.

810
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
AND I THINK, YES, I WILL -- WE

811
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
CAN TALK ABOUT GUN CONTROL, YOU

812
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
AND I AS MOTHERS, AS REPUBLICAN

813
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
AND DEMOCRAT, AND WE SHOULD TALK

814
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND WHO HE

815
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
WAS AND WHAT CONTRIBUTED.

816
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
AND YOU KNOW, THEN LET'S FO

817
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
FORMULATE THOSE OPINIONS.

818
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE

819
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE I HAVE

820
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
LOOKED AT VARIOUS ISSUES ON GUN

821
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
CONTROL WHERE I'VE DIVERTED FROM

822
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
MY PARTY AGAIN.

823
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
IN THIS CASE, THIS GUY SERIOUSLY

824
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
SNAPPED.

825
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
AND THE GUNS DIDN'T MAKE HIM
SNAP.

826
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
HE SNAPPED AND THEN SOUGHT OUT

827
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
THE GUNS.
AND WHETHER THEY WERE HIS

828
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
MANAGER'S GUNS OR WHETHER THEY

829
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
-- HIS MOTHER'S GUNS OR WHETHER

830
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
THEY WERE SOMEBODY ELSE'S, HE

831
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
WAS GOING SNAP AND DO SOMETHING

832
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
HORRIFIC AND HEINOUS,

833
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
UNFORTUNATELY.

834
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
>> Reporter: WE KNOW -- BUT WE

835
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
KNOW HE USED GUNS, AND THAT'S

836
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
HOW HE KILLED 26 PEOPLE AND THEN

837
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
TOOK HIS MOTHER'S LIFE AND TOOK

838
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
HIS OWN LIFE.

839
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
IT WAS GUNS.

840
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
MARY BONO MACK, ALWAYS NICE TO

841
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
TALK TO YOU.

842
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU OCCUPY

843
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
THAT.
YOU AND I WILL CONTINUE THIS

844
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
CONVERSATION.
I THINK PEOPLE ARE SICK OF ALL

845
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
THE -- YOU KNOW, THE
CONVERSATION AROUND IT.

846
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
AND WE NEVER ACTUALLY DO

847
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
ANYTHING.
AND I -- YOU KNOW, MAYBE IN

848
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
NATION PEOPLE OF TIRED OF THAT

849
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
AT THIS POINT.

850
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT.

851
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
THANK YOU FOR TALKING WITH US.

852
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
>> THANK YOU, SOLEDAD.

853
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I THINK WE SHOULD BE TALKING

854
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
ABOUT ALL OF THESE ISSUE.

855
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
THANK YOU.

856
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
>> Reporter: I APPRECIATED THAT.

857
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
MARY BONO MACK, CONGRESSWOMAN,

858
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
JOINING US THIS MORNING.
WE HAVE LOTS TO UPDATE YOU ON.

859
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A PRESS

860
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
CONFERENCE.

861
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN AT

862
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
8:00.

863
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
IT'S BEEN DELAYED.
UNCLEAR WHY IT'S BEEN DELAYED.
