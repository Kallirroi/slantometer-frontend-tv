PEOPLE THAT FAR AWAY CARE ABOUT

187
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
US.

188
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
>> TWO SIMPLE WORDS, THANK YOU.

189
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
AND WE HAVE ALSO NOW LEARNED

190
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
THAT THE U.S. SENATE, MEMBERS OF

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
THE SENATE, HAVE OBSERVED A

192
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
MOMENT OF SILENCE.
WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT HERE, TAKE

193
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
A LOOK.

194
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
>> I NOW ASK THAT THE UNITED

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
STATES SENATE OBSERVE A MOMENT

196
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
OF SILENCE TO HONOR THE VICTIMS

197
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
OF THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

198
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
SCHOOL TRAGEDY.

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
>> MR. PRESIDENT --

200
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000

201
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
MOMENT WITH YOU AS WE JUST

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
LEARNED THAT THE FLOOR OF THE

204
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
U.S. SENATE IN SILENCE, IN

205
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
MEMORY OF THE LOST LIVES HERE IN

206
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

207
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
LET ME ALSO KEEP YOU UP TO SPEED

208
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
IN TERMS OF THE INVESTIGATION, A

209
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
POSSIBLE MOTIVE.

210
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
WE HAVE NEW DETAILS FROM POLICE

211
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
THAT MAY COMPLICATE THE SEARCH

212
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
FOR A MOTIVE.

213
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
>> THERE WAS NO CONNECTION

214
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
BETWEEN THE SHOOTER AND THE

215
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
SCHOOL ACCORDING TO THE SCHOOL

216
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
AUTHORITIES HERE IN NEWTOWN.

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
>> NONE AT ALL?

218
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
>> ACCORDING TO THE SCHOOL

219
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
AUTHORITIES IN NEWTOWN.

220
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
>> WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED ABOUT

221
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
ANOTHER SURVIVOR OF FRIDAY'S

222
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
MASSACRE.
POLICE SAY NOW NOT ONE, TWO

223
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
ADULTS WERE SHOT AND WOUNDED AT

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
THE SCHOOL, BOTH ADULTS NOW

225
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
RECOVERING FROM INJURIES.

226
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I WANT TO BRING IN DON LEMON WHO

227
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
HAS BEEN HERE FOR A COUPLE OF

228
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
DAYS HERE IN NEWTOWN.

229
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
LET ME ASK YOU FIRST, JUST ABOUT

230
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
NANCY LANZA, THE GUNMAN'S

231
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
MOTHER.

232
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
YOU'VE TALKED TO FRIENDS WHO

233
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
KNEW HER, WHAT DID THEY SHARE

234
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
WITH YOU?

235
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
>> THEY APPROACHED ME THE OTHER

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
NIGHT BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY

237
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
WERE HEARING SOME THINGS IN THE

238
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
MEDIA THAT THEY JUST -- THAT

239
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
JUST DIDN'T RING TRUE TO THEM

240
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
ABOUT NANCY LANZA AND PEOPLE

241
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
WERE IN SOME WAY, THEY FELT,

242
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
MAYBE BLAMING HER FOR WHAT

243
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
HAPPENED.

244
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
THEY SAID, YES, YOU KNOW, THEY

245
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
SAID THAT THE SHOOTER DID HAVE

246
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
ASPERGER'S SYNDROME AND THAT HE,

247
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
YOU KNOW, HE WAS SOMEONE -- A

248
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
KID WHO KEPT TO HIMSELF, BUT

249
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
THEY SAY SHE WAS A RESPONSIBLE

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
MOTHER AND IN THEIR ESTIMATION A

251
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
GOOD MOTHER.

252
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
FOUR OF HER FRIENDS I TALKED TO

253
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
WHO ALL APPROACHED ME AND SAID,

254
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS

255
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
WOMAN, BECAUSE SHE IS AMONG THE

256
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
VICTIMS AND QUITE FRANKLY THIS

257
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
IS A HORRIBLE THING, UNDENIABLE

258
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE KIDS, BUT

259
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
THEY LOVED HER AND THEY WANT

260
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT HER.
TAKE A LISTEN.

261
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
>> TELL US ABOUT NANCY, WE DON'T

262
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
KNOW MUCH ABOUT HER.

263
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
>> NANCY WAS JUST A LOVELY

264
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
WOMAN.

265
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
A GREAT FRIEND, YOU KNOW, WARM

266
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
PERSONALITY.

267
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
YOU KNOW, SHE WOULD JUST MAKE

268
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
YOU SMILE WHEN SHE WALKED INTO

269
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
THE ROOM.

270
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
>> YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO TALK

271
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
ABOUT HER BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME

272
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
THINGS YOU WANTED TO CLEAR UP.

273
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
>> WELL, I'VE SEEN A LOT OF

274
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THINGS IN THE MEDIA ABOUT HER

275
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
BEING THIS SURVIVALIST WACKO AND

276
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
THAT WAS NOT HER AT ALL.

277
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
SHE WAS -- SHE DID HAVE GUNS,

278
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
WHICH SHE USED VERY RESPONSIBLY.

279
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
SHE WENT SHOOTING WITH MUTUAL

280
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
FRIEND OF OURS WHO IS A RETIRED

281
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
NEW YORK CITY POLICE OFFICER.

282
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
SO, YOU KNOW, HE TAUGHT HER HOW

283
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
TO SHOOT, SHE WAS VERY

284
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
RESPONSIBLE WITH THE GUN.

285
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
SHE WAS VERY RESPONSIBLE PERSON

286
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
IN GENERAL.
ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF SAFETY.

287
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
>> AND SHE TOOK THE BOYS TO THE

288
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
SHOOTING RANGE.

289
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT.

290
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
SHE DID TAKE THEM TO THE

291
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
SHOOTING RANGE.
>> FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, YES.

292
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
>> AND WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SAY

293
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
ABOUT THAT?

294
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
>> AGAIN, I GUESS I WANT TO JUST

295
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
MIMIC RUSS AS FAR AS HER SAFETY.

296
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
NANCY WOULDN'T EVEN ANSWER A

297
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
PHONE OR A TEXT OR EVEN LOOK AT

298
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
HER TEXT IN THE CAR.

299
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
IF I GOT IN HER CAR, IT WAS

300
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
OOPS, SEAT BELT, AT THE FIRST

301
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
DING.
OR BEFORE THE DING HAPPENED.

302
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
SO SHE WAS JUST VERY CAREFUL AND

303
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
CAUTIOUS AND RESPONSIBLE.

304
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
AND IN REGARD TO, YOU KNOW,

305
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
LEAVING ANYTHING OUT, AS FAR AS

306
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
A GUN, JUST -- I CAN'T BELIEVE

307
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
THAT SHE WOULD DO THAT.

308
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
>> SEBASTIAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

309
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
TELL US ABOUT YOUR MEMORY.

310
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
>> MY MEMORIES OF HER, SHE WAS A

311
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
VERY DIGNIFIED WOMAN.

312
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
SHE HAD A LOT OF CLASS.

313
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
VERY PROPER.
HAD A GREAT MORAL COMPASS.

314
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
WE JUST SAW HER, WHAT, THREE

315
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
WEEKS AGO, MY PLACE, AND I LEFT

316
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
AND DIDN'T SAY BYE AND SHE SENDS

317
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
ME A TEXT, YOU DIDN'T SAY BYE TO

318
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
ME.
THAT'S THE KIND OF PERSON SHE

319
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
WAS.
POLITE AND NICE TO YOU.

320
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
JUST A REALLY GOOD PERSON.

321
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
>> AND, BROOKE, THEY SAID,

322
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
CONTRARY TO WHAT PEOPLE HAD BEEN

323
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
SAYING, SHE DID NOT WORK FOR THE

324
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
SCHOOL, DID NOT VOLUNTEER FOR
THE SCHOOL.

325
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
SHE WAS THINKING OF MOVING

326
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO FIND A

327
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE SO HE COULD

328
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
HAVE AS NORMAL AN ADULT LIFE AS

329
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
POSSIBLE.
>> WE'RE LEARNING MORE HIM AND

330
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
SOME OF THE OTHER VICTIMS.

331
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT, WE WERE

332
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
HERE LAST NIGHT, FOR THE

333
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
PRESIDENT, THIS TOWN WAS PACKED,

334
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
DIFFICULT TO MOVE AROUND, JUST

335
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
BECAUSE WHEN THE PRESS PRESIDENT

336
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
IS IN TOWN, SECURITY IS

337
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
DIFFICULT.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

338
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
GOVERNOR HERE, DAN MALLOY, HE

339
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
SAID SOMETHING POIGNANT, USED

340
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
THIS IMAGERY, IT IS COLD AND

341
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
WE'RE CLOSE TO WINTER AND LISTEN

342
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
TO WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE

343
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
SNOWFALL.

344
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
>> LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT IN

345
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
WINTER EACH TIME I SEE THE

346
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
BEGINNING OF A SNOWFALL, WILL BE

347
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
THINKING OF THOSE 27 SOULS LOST

348
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO.

349
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
EACH TIME THE DAY GETS A LITTLE

350
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
LONGER, I WILL THINK AND DREAM

351
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
OF THE LIVES THAT MIGHT HAVE

352
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
BEEN AND THE LIVES THAT WERE SO

353
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
FULL OF GRACE.

354
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
AND WHEN THE FLOWERS START TO

355
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
COME OUT OF THE GROUND, AND WHEN

356
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
THEY RISE UP, I WILL KNOW THAT

357
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
WE ARE IN TOUCH WITH THOSE THAT

358
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
WE HAVE LOST IN THE LAST FEW

359
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
DAYS.

360
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
>> IT GIVES YOU GOOSEBUMPS

361
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
LISTENING TO IT AGAIN.
AS WE WERE WATCHING FROM OUR

362
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
LIVE TRUCK, WATCHING THEM, THAT

363
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
MEMORIAL AND WATCHING THE

364
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
GOVERNOR, THE SNOW STARTED TO

365
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
FALL.
>> AFTER THAT MEMORIAL.

366
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
>> THE SNOW STARTED TO FALL.

367
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
>> ISN'T THAT AMAZING?

368
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
THE WEATHER HAS BEEN INDICATIVE

369
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
OF THE WAY PEOPLE FEEL, DREARY,

370
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
COLD AND WET.

371
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
SOME PEOPLE SAY IT IS SYNONYMOUS

372
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
WITH TEARS.
I THINK THE WHOLE COUNTRY,

373
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
AMERICA'S HEART IS BROKEN AT

374
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
THIS POINT.
>> ABSOLUTELY.

375
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
DON, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

376
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000

379
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
YOU CAN HELP THE PEOPLE HERE

380
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
AFFECTED IN NEWTOWN,

381
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
CONNECTICUT.
GO TO CNN.COM/IMPACT.

382
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
CNN.COM/IMPACT TO LEARN HOW YOU

383
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
CAN GIVE.

384
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
OF COURSE, SCHOOLS ACROSS THE

385
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
COUNTRY ARE ON HEIGHTENED ALERT

386
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
NOW AFTER NEWTOWN'S TRAGEDY.

387
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO ONE

388
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
EXPERT ABOUT WHETHER CURRENT

389
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
TACTICS, WHAT IS GOING ON IN

390
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
SCHOOLS TODAY, DRILLS YOUR

391
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
CHILDREN MAY BE GOING THROUGH,

392
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
SHOULD THEY BE CHANGED INCLUDING

393
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
WHETHER STUDENTS SHOULD EVER

394
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
FIGHT BACK.

395
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's hard to see opportunity

396
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
in today's challenging
environment.

397
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Unless you have the right
perspective.

398
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
BNY Mellon Wealth Management
has the vision

399
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and experience to look beyond
the obvious.

400
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We'll uncover opportunities,
find hidden risk,

401
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and make success a reality.

402
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
BNY Mellon Wealth Management

403
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
>>> ONE OF THE FIRST DETAILS

404
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE GAVE

405
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
ABOUT THE MASS KILLING HERE IN

406
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
NEWTOWN, AS SOON AS OFFICERS GOT

407
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
TO SANDY HOOK, THEY WENT RIGHT

408
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
INTO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

409
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
>> ON AND OFF DUTY TROOPERS

410
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
RESPONDED TO THE CALL AND WITH

411
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
POLICE IMMEDIATELY UPON ARRIVAL

412
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
ENTERED THE SCHOOL AND BEGAN A

413
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
COMPLETE ACTIVE SHOOTER SEARCH

414
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
OF THE BUILDING.

415
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
>> THAT IS A TOTAL SWITCH IN

416
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
TACTICS AND LAW ENFORCERS SAY

417
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THEY

418
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
LEARNED IN 1999, IN LITTLETON,

419
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
COLORADO, THE COLUMBINE HIGH

420
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING, OFFICERS THERE

421
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
WERE HEAVILY CRITICIZED FOR NOT

422
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
ENTERING THE BUILDING AS THEY

423
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
WAITED FOR S.W.A.T. TEAMS TO

424
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
ARRIVE.
WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE PAST,

425
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE?

426
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
WHAT WILL SCHOOLS DO IN THE WAKE

427
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN NEWTOWN

428
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
ON FRIDAY MORNING?

429
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
KEN TRUMP IS FROM THE NATIONAL

430
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
SCHOOL SAFETY AND SECURITY

431
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
SERVICES WHICH HELPS SCHOOL

432
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
DISTRICTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

433
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
SECURITY AND EMERGENCY

434
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
PREPAREDNESS.

435
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
SO, KEN, WELCOME TO YOU.

436
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I KNOW YOU ARE HERE IN NEWTOWN,

437
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
YOURSELF.
JUST OFF THE TOP HERE, WHAT WERE

438
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
YOUR IMPRESSIONS OF WHAT YOU SAW

439
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
AND EXPERIENCED?

440
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
>> MINE STARTED AS A FATHER.

441
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I WAS ON MY KID'S PLAYGROUND,

442
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
SUPERVISING, VOLUNTEERING AT

443
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
RECESS TIME, AND 25 YEARS OF

444
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
SCHOOL SAFETY EXPERIENCE WENT

445
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
OUT THE DOOR AS A PUNCH IN THE

446
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
GUT WHEN YOU HEAR IT OCCURRED AT

447
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

448
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
AND WHEN I WAS IN NEWTOWN, I

449
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
FOUND IT REALLY HARD TO ASK

450
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
ANYBODY WHAT DO YOU ASK PEOPLE?

451
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
WE KNOW HOW THEY FEEL.

452
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I THINK THAT IT'S SUCH A

453
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
LONG-TERM RECOVERY PROCESS.

454
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
WE KNOW FROM OTHER HIGH PROFILE

455
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
INCIDENTS.

456
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
AND I THINK ANOTHER CONCERN IS

457
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
THE PARENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

458
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
ARE ALARMED FROM -- ABOUT ASKING

459
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
QUESTIONS BECAUSE OUR MOST

460
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
VULNERABLE CHILDREN HAVE NOW

461
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
BECOME A TARGET IN ONE OF OUR

462
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
SCHOOLS AND PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED

463
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

464
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
BUT THEY SHOULD SEND THEIR KIDS

465
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
TO SCHOOL.

466
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
>> KEN, THOUGH, LET ME ASK YOU,

467
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
AS WE'RE HEARING THE STORIES

468
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
FROM THIS PRINCIPAL IN

469
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
PARTICULAR, WHO JUST INSTALLED

470
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
THIS NEW SECURITY SYSTEM, YOU
HAD TO RING THE DOORBELL IF YOU

471
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
WERE COMING TO THE SCHOOL AFTER

472
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
9:30 IN THE MORNING.

473
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
YOU KNOW, THEY SEEM TO BE DOING

474
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
ALL THE RIGHT THINGS HERE IN

475
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
NEWTOWN.

476
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
WHAT IS THE TAKEAWAY FOR SCHOOLS

477
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
MOVING FORWARD?

478
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
IS IN A TAKEAWAY?

479
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
>> I WANT TO PROPOSE A DIFFERENT

480
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
WAY OF LOOKING AT THIS SLIGHTLY.

481
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
SADLY THE OUTCOME WAS TRAGIC.

482
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
THE NEW SECURITY SYSTEM PEOPLE

483
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
HAVE SAID DIDN'T FAIL.

484
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I WOULD SAY THAT IT -- WE

485
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
CERTAINLY DIDN'T HAVE THE

486
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
DESIRED OUTCOME WITH NO LIVES

487
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
LOST.

488
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
BUT A SECURITY SYSTEM WILL

489
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
EITHER DETER THOSE WHO ARE

490
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
DETERRABLE OR DELAY OTHERS.

491
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
AND I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE IT

492
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
DELAYED EVEN IN SECONDS THE

493
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
SHOOTER, AND THAT IT GAVE AN

494
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME KIDS TO GET

495
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
TO A SAFE PLACE.

496
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I THINK THAT ANY TECHNOLOGY IS

497
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
AN EXTRA TOOL, BUT WE TEND TO

498
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
LOOK FOR A QUICK FIX.

499
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO DETER OR

500
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
DELAY.

501
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
A SECOND -- SECONDS CAN MEAN THE

502
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
MOST VALUABLE TIME.

503
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
BUT I THINK LOOK AT THE HUMAN

504
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
ASPECT BEHIND IT.

505
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
YOU HAVE A PRINCIPAL AND A

506
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST WHO DIDN'T

507
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
RUN FROM THE GUNMAN, BUT WENT TO

508
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
PROTECT THE CHILDREN.

509
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
YOU HAVE TEACHERS WHO KNEW TO

510
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
LOCK DOWN, STAFF TRAINED, THE

511
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
SECURITY SYSTEM.
THERE ARE MANY OF THE BEST

512
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
PRACTICES IN PLACE THAT WERE

513
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
IMPLEMENTED.
I DON'T KNOW WE NEED TO TOTALLY

514
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
THROW OUT THE PLAYBOOK.

515
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I KNOW WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

516
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
FOCUS ON THE FUNDAMENTALS AND

517
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
ALSO LOOK AT RESOURCES THAT ARE

518
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
DEDICATED TO SECURITY, WHICH

519
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
HAVE BEEN CUT BACK IN RECENT

520
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
YEARS.
>> WELL, KEN, LET ME BRING YOU

521
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
BACK TO YOUR POINT, THOUGH YOU

522
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
POINT OUT WHAT THE SCHOOL

523
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
PSYCHOLOGIST AND THE PRINCIPAL

524
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
WERE SORT OF LUNGING AT THIS

525
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
GUNMAN.
I READ AN ARTICLE THAT DAWN

526
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
HOCHSPRUNG, THE PRINCIPAL, WAS

527
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
SHOUTING BACK AT A TEACHER DOWN

528
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
THE HALL, CLOSE THE DOOR, LOCK

529
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
IT FROM THE INSIDE.

530
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
WHAT IS PROPER PROTOCOL, HEAVEN

531
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
FORBID SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS

532
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
DOWN THE ROAD, WHAT SHOULD

533
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
TEACHERS, WHAT SHOULD STUDENTS

534
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
DO?
SHOULD THEY FIGHT BACK?

535
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
SHOULD THEY RUN?

536
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
OR SHOULD THEY HIDE?

537
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
>> WELL, I THINK THAT THERE ARE

538
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
GOING TO BE NATURAL INSTINCTS

539
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
THAT KICK IN AS IT DID WITH THE

540
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
PRINCIPALS AND WE HAVE SEEN

541
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
ELSEWHERE WITH TEACHERS WHO HAVE

542
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
STEPPED IN FRONT OF A BULLET,

543
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
WHO TACKLED GUNMAN AND TAKEN

544
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
OTHER ACTIONS BASED ON THE

545
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
SCENARIO AT HAND.

546
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
THE BEST PRACTICES HAVE INCLUDED

547
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
TO PRACTICE LOCKDOWNS, DOING

548
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
EVACUATIONS, CERTAINLY SOME WHO

549
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
HAVE BEEN INSTINCTIVELY GOT OUT

550
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
OF HARM'S WAY.

551
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I THINK WE'RE STEPPING INTO SOME

552
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
DANGEROUS AREA IF WE START

553
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
TALKING ABOUT TEACHING

554

SOME WILL BE CLOSED.

739
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
WHAT IS HAPPENING ALL AROUND ME

744
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
IN PORTLAND, OREGON.

745
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
THERE ARE 20 FOR THE LITTLE
LIVES LOST.

754
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000

755
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
OF TOWN, THE BIG FLAG IS NOW

756
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
FLYING AT HALF-STAFF.

757
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
THIS IS THE FIREHOUSE HERE WHERE

758
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
A LOT OF THE FAMILIES HUDDLED

759
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000

DAUGHTERS.

762
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
WE CAN'T CROSS THE STREET.

763

MANY OF THESE FIRST RESPONDERS

STILL VERY MUCH STILL REELING

768
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000

WANT TO READ YOU A QUOTE, FROM A

771
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER, 39 YEARS

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
HERE, HE SAID, I'VE SEEN SOME

773
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
HORRENDOUS THINGS IN 39 YEARS AS

774
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
A FIREFIGHTER.

775
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I WENT

776
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
HOME AND CRIED.

777
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I DID MANAGE TO TALK TO TWO

778
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
YOUNGER FIREFIGHTERS HERE AND

779
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
THEY TOLD ME REALLY THE

780
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
PRIORITY, BEYOND THE COMMUNITY,

781
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
GRIEF COUNSELORS TO HELP THEM

782
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
COPE WITH WHAT THEY SAW.

783
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
BACK HERE LIVE, JUST TALKING TO

784
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN AND AROUND

785
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
THE COMMUNITY AND YOUR HEART

786
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
BREAKS FOR THEM.
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

787
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
WONDERING IF WHAT HAS HAPPENED

788
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
HERE WILL CHANGE THE DEBATE OVER

789
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
GUN CONTROL.

790
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HASN'T OFFERED

791
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
SPECIFICS AS TO WHAT HE WILL DO.

792
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
BUT MADE IT CLEAR, HE WANTS TO

793
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
PREVENT FUTURE TRAGEDIES LIKE
THIS ONE.

794
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
>> IN THE COMING WEEKS I'LL USE

795
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE HOLDS

796
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
TO ENGAGE MY FELLOW CITIZENS

797
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, TO MENTAL

HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, TO PARENTS

799
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
AND EDUCATORS IN AN EFFORT AIMED

800
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
AT PREVENTING MORE TRAGEDIES

801
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
LIKE THIS.

802
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
>> THAT WAS THE PRESIDENT

803
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
SPEAKING LAST NIGHT AT THE HIGH

804
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
SCHOOL HERE.

805
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
BUT I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT

806
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM WEST

807
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
VIRGINIA, HERE IS WHAT JOE

808
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
MANCHIN SAID.

809
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
HE'S WEIGHING IN AS WELL.

810
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
HE'S A GUN OWNER FROM A RURAL

811
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
STATE, FULL OF HUNTERS LIKE

812
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
HIMSELF.
SO THIS MORNING HE SAID THAT

813
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
WHEN IT COMES TO GUN CONTROL, IT

814
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
IS TIME FOR EVERYONE TO JOIN THE

815
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
DISCUSSION.

816
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
>> WE HAVE GOT TO SIT DOWN.

817
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I ASK ALL MY FRIENDS IN THE NRA

818
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
AND I'M A PROUD NRA MEMBER AND

819
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN, WE NEED TO SIT

820
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
DOWN AND MOVE THIS DIALOGUE TO A

821
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
REASONABLE APPROACH TO FIXING

822
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
IT.
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE ON THE

823
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
TABLE AND I THINK IT WILL BE.

824
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
>> IN THE WEST, A LOT OF GUN

825
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
SHOW CUSTOMERS HAVE NEWTOWN ON

826
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
THEIR MINDS AND THEY HAVE THEIR

827
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
OWN IDEAS AS TO HOW THE

828
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
SHOOTINGS COULD HAVE BEEN

829
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
PREVENTED.

830
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
HERE IS CNN'S CASEY WIAN.

831

OREGON SHOPPING MALL, EVEN WITH

834
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
THE MASS SHOOTINGS IT HAS BECOME

835
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
EASIER FOR MOST AMERICANS TO

836
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
CARRY A GUN, OWN AN ASSAULT

837
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
RIFLE OR USE HIGH CAPACITY

838
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
MAGAZINES.
BUT IN THE AFTERMATH OF

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000

GUN CONTROL.

842

YOU WON'T HEAR THEM AT A

843
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
CALIFORNIA GUN SHOW HELD THE DAY

844
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
AFTER THE CONNECTICUT MASSACRE.

845
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
>> EVERYBODY IS IN A PANIC.

846
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY PEOPLE
AT A GUN SHOW.

847
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I THINK THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT

848
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

849
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000

850
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
FOR THE VICTIMS.

851
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
>> IT IS HORRIBLE THAT THOSE

852
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
CHILDREN DID DIE.

853
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000

854
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
HERE, MORE GUNS.

855
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000

OF THEM, A FACULTY MEMBER, A

857
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
JANITOR, HAD A GUN, BAM, HE

858
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
WOULD HAVE KILLED AN EIGHTH,

859
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT HE WAS

860
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
CAPABLE OF DOING.

861
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
YOU HAVE TO ALLOW US TO PROTECT

862
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
OURSELVES.
>> THE GUNS REALLY DIDN'T KILL

863

PEOPLE.

864
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
IT WAS THE PERSON WHO WAS CRAZY.

865
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
HE WAS MENTALLY UNSTABLE.

866
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000

BEFORE THE CONNECTICUT SHOOTING

869
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
IT IS TIME TO CONSIDER GUN

870

CONTROL LEGISLATION.
BUT ACKNOWLEDGES IT WILL BE

871
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000

OUT THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR WHERE

1016
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
HER CLASSROOM WAS LOCATED, AND

1017
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000

1185

>> THERE WAS A PENNSYLVANIA

1186
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
SCHOOL THAT WAS ACTUALLY BLOWN

1187
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
UP, YOU KNOW, FIVE DECADES AGO

1188

BUT I WILL GIVE YOU MY BEST TAKE

1191
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
AND IT WOULD BE THE FOLLOWING.

1192
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
THAT WHEN A PERPETRATOR CROSSES

1193
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
THE THRESHOLD, THEY NO LONGER

1194
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
SEE PEOPLE AS HUMAN BEINGS.

1195
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
RATHER THEY BECOME AN OBJECT.

1196
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
THAT OBJECT MEANS THEY HAVE NO

1197
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
EMPATHY, NO SYMPATHY, DON'T SEE

1198
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000

AND I'M NOT IN ANY WAY

1199
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000

1209
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
WHY AND WHEN THAT DAY, WE MAY

1210
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000

1218
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
WHY IS THAT?

1219
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
>> WELL, I BELIEVE -- UP UNTIL

1220
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
THIS YEAR I WAS NOT CONVINCED

1221
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
ISSUES SUCH AS THE ECONOMY WERE

1222
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
PLAYING A ROLE, BUT I THINK WHAT

1223
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
IS HAPPENING IS PEOPLE ARE
FALLING OUT OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS,

1224
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
NOT BEING REIMBURSED FOR MEDICAL

1225
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
CARE.

1226
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
SOMETIMES THE DROP IN SOCIETY

1227
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
MEANS PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING THE

1228
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
MEDICATIONS, UNABLE TO SEE THEIR

1229
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
PHYSICIANS.
THAT'S A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE.

1230
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
THE OTHER IS CLEARLY THE WHOLE

1231
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
PROBLEM OF COPYCATS.

1232
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS YEAR, WHICH

1233
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
IS AS YOU SAID WILL BE THE

1234
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
WORST, THE SIKH TEMPLE SHOOTING

1235
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
OR FT. HOOD OR NEW YORK CITY, WE

1236
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
HAVE TO NOT BLAME YOUNG PEOPLE

1237
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
THERE IS A LOT OF CHATTER BY

1238
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
SO-CALLED EXPERTS THAT SAY THIS

1239
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
IS MOSTLY DONE BY YOUNG PEOPLE.

1240
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
MANY OF THESE PERPETRATORS ARE

1241
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
IN THEIR 30s, 40s AND 50s.

1242
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
SO IN TERMS OF WHY, I THINK PART

1243
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
OF IT IS MENTAL HEALTH GAPS.

1244
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000

00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
UNDERSTAND, YOU WERE BORN WITH
INTUITION.

1246

1247

GIFT AT BIRTH.

1248
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
AND IF YOU SEE OR SENSE SOMEONE

1249
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
THAT YOU LOVE OR SOMEONE THAT

1250
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
YOU WORK WITH OR IT MAY BE A

1251
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000

THEY'LL KNOCK ON THE DOOR OF

THEY'LL TRY TO TALK WITH THEM TO

1256
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000

1257
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
SOME SOFT OBSERVATION.

1258
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000

00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Get a great deal on a new Subaru

1276
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
and 250 dollars goes to your
choice of five charities.

1277
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
By the end of this, our fifth
year,

1278
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
our total can reach almost 25
million dollars.

1279
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
It's a nice reflection on us
all.

1280
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Now through January 2nd.

1281
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
>>> WE WANT TO RETURN QUICKLY

1282
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
NOW TO THE BIG STORY OUT OF

1283
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
WASHINGTON.
THERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER MEETING

1284
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY BETWEEN

1285
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
THE PRESIDENT AND HOUSE SPEAKER

1286
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
JOHN BOEHNER.

1287
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
A SIGN, PERHAPS, OF SOME

1288
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
CONCRETE PROGRESS TOWARD

1289
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
AVERTING THE SO-CALLED FISCAL

1290
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
CLIFF.
THAT LOOMING EVENT THAT WOULD

1291
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
BRING HIGHER TAXES FOR EVERYONE

1292
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
AND BLUNT FORCE GOVERNMENT

1293
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
SPENDING CUTS, INCLUDING CUTS TO

1294
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
THE PENTAGON BUDGET, COME

1295
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
JANUARY 1st.
DANA BASH IS ON CAPITOL HILL.

1296
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
WE HAVE TWO WEEKS NOW TO GO

1297
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
UNTIL THE DEADLINE.

1298
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
BUT THERE WAS THIS 45-MINUTE

1299
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE

1300
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
TODAY.
WHAT'S IT ALL MEAN?

1301
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
>> Reporter: YOU KNOW, I WISH I

1302
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
WAS A FLY ON THE WALL.

1303
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I'M SURE YOU DO TOO, IN THAT

1304
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
MEETING.

1305
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
THE FACT THAT IT WAS 45 MINUTES,

1306
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
YOU KNOW, IT MAKES YOU A LITTLE

1307
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
BIT CONCERNED THAT MAYBE IF IT

1308
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
WERE LONGER THEY WOULD HAVE MORE

1309
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
PROGRESS.
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

1310
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
OVER THE PAST FOUR, FIVE DAYS OR

1311
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
SO, ACCORDING TO SOURCES IN BOTH

1312
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
PARTIES, THERE HAS BEEN GENERAL

1313
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
PROGRESS MADE.

1314
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
AND DIEDRA WALSH AND I HAVE BEEN

1315
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
HEARING FROM SOURCES, BOTH

1316
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
PARTIES, THAT RIGHT NOW AT THIS

1317
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
POINT THE TALKS ARE CENTERED

1318
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
AROUND ABOUT A $2 TRILLION DEAL,

1319
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
A TRILLION DOLLARS IN SPENDING

1320
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
CUTS, ABOUT A TRILLION DOLLARS

1321
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
IN TAX REVENUE.

1322
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE THIS IS WHAT

1323
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
THE REPUBLICANS ARE PUSHING.

1324
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
DEMOCRATIC SOURCES SAY THEY'RE

1325
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
STILL NOT SURE BIG PICTURE, THAT

1326
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
THEY COULD PASS THIS, BECAUSE

1327
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
MUCH OF THE SPENDING HAD TO DO

1328
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
WITH CHANGES IN MEDICARE THAT

1329
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
MIGHT BE HARD FOR DEMOCRATS TO

1330
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
SWALLOW.
ALL OF THE SPECIFICS ABOUT RATE

1331
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
CUTS AND THINGS THAT REALLY

1332
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
DIVIDE THEM ARE STILL WAITING TO

1333
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
HEAR, BUT THE FACT THEY'RE

1334
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
TALKING IS DEFINITELY A GOOD

1335
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
SIGN.

1336
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
GIVEN WHERE WE ARE ON THE

1337
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
CALENDAR.
>> THE DIFFERENCE IS VERY MUCH

1338
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
STILL THERE, BUT APPARENTLY

1339
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
NARROWING WITH SPEAKER BOEHNER

1340
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
NOW AT LEAST AGREEING THAT THERE

1341
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
COULD BE SOME ACTUAL HIKES IN

1342
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
THE TAX RATES.

1343
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
>> EXACTLY.

1344
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
EXACTLY.

1345
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
THAT SEEMED TO BE WHAT KIND OF

1346
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
OPENED UP THIS PROGRESS THAT
WE'RE TOLD ABOUT FROM BOTH

1347
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
SIDES, THE FACT THAT REPUBLICANS

1348
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
COULD GO FOR THAT.

1349
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
NOW, WHAT HE PROPOSED WAS

1350
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
RAISING TAX RATES FOR PEOPLE

1351
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
WITH AN INCOME OF A MILLION

1352
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
DOLLARS OR MORE.

1353
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
DEMOCRATS AND THE PRESIDENT

1354
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
CAMPAIGNED CONSTANTLY ON THE
IDEA OF RAISING TAX RATES FOR

1355
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
FAMILIES MAKING $250,000 OR

1356
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
MORE.

1357
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
THAT'S A NONSTARTER FOR THE

1358
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
WHITE HOUSE.
THE IDEA OF PUTTING HIGHER TAX

1359
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
RATES FOR WEALTHY AMERICANS OF

1360
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
ANY SORT TO THE TABLE WAS

1361
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
CONSIDERED A BREAKTHROUGH.

1362
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
>> DANA, THE HORRIFIC EVENTS IN

1363
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
NEWTOWN IN A WAY CAST A SHADOW

1364
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
OVER THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

1365
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
WASHINGTON ALSO.
WE SAW A MOMENT OF SILENCE AT

1366
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
THE SENATE.

1367
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO.

1368
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
WHAT ABOUT ACTION?

1369
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
WHAT ARE SENATORS SAYING ABOUT

1370
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
ACTUAL ACTION ON THE HILL?

1371
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
>> Reporter: WELL, YOU KNOW
THIS, JOHN, YOU'VE BEEN COVERING

1372
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
POLITICS FOR YEARS AS WELL, THAT

1373
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
PART OF THE -- REALLY THE MAIN

1374
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
REASON WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY

1375
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
ACTION ON GUN CONTROL IS BECAUSE

1376
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
DEMOCRATS PULLED BACK BIG TIME

1377
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
FROM PUSHING THIS ISSUE BECAUSE

1378
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
THEY REALLY GOT CRUSHED

1379
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
POLITICALLY, RED STATES, FROM

1380
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL, ON DOWN.

1381
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
SO THEY JUST THOUGHT IT WAS BAD

1382
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
POLITICS.

1383
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT THIS TIME,

1384
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS

1385
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
SHOOTING, BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING

1386
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
ABOUT SMALL CHILDREN, THERE IS A

1387
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
DIFFERENT FEELING, A DIFFERENT

1388
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
ATMOSPHERE HERE.

1389
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
JOE MANCHIN, DEMOCRATIC SENATOR

1390
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
WHO IS AN -- HE SAID HE THINKS

1391
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
THERE SHOULD BE STRICTER GUN

1392
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
LAWS.

1393
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
WHY DO YOU THINK THIS MOMENT MAY

1394
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
BE DIFFERENT?

1395
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
>> BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A

1396
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
LOGICAL CONTINUUM.

1397
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
IF THERE SHOULD BE A SAFE PLACE

1398
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
IN AMERICA, IT IS AN ELEMENTARY

1399
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
SCHOOL.

1400
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
AND HERE IN THIS ELEMENTARY

1401
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
SCHOOL, LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.

1402
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
6-YEAR-OLDS WITH 3 TO 11 BULLETS

1403
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
FROM THIS BUSHMASTER IN THEIR

1404
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
BODY, 20 OF THEM.

1405
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
IS THIS AMERICA?
I DON'T THINK SO.

1406
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
AND I THINK THESE INCIDENTS ARE

1407
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
GOING TO CONTINUE UNTIL WE DO

1408
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
SOMETHING TO CHANGE THE SUPPLY

1409
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
MODE OF THESE WEAPONS OUT IN OUR
SOCIETY.

1410
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
>> Reporter: AND, JOHN, WHEN I

1411
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
TALKED TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN, SHE

1412
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
JUST HUNG UP THE PHONE WITH HER

1413
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUE FROM WEST

1414
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
VIRGINIA, JOE MANCHIN.

1415
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
THE TWO DECIDED THEY WOULD COME

1416
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
TOGETHER AND TALK TO SENATOR

1417
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
MANCHIN ABOUT WAYS SHE MIGHT BE

1418
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
ABLE TO CHANGE HER LEGISLATION

1419
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
TO GET HIM ON BOARD.

1420
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
THAT WOULD BE FROM HER

1421
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
PERSPECTIVE A BIG, BIG DEAL TO

1422
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
HELP PUSH ALONG THIS LEGISLATION

1423
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
THAT STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO.

1424
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
A LOT OF POLITICS TO OVERCOME.

1425
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
>> THAT WOULD BE A BIG DEAL, TO

1426
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
PUSH SOME KIND OF BOTH SIDE OF

1427
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

1428
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
DANA BASH FROM CAPITOL HILL,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1429
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
>>> WHEN WE COME BACK, BROOKE

1430
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
BALDWIN WILL HAVE MORE ON THE

1431
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
TRAGEDY FROM NEWTOWN,

1432
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
CONNECTICUT.
looked away from my screen.

1433
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550

1434
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
That kind of focus...

1435
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
that's what I have
when I trade.

1436
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550

1437
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
And the StreetSmart Edge trading
platform from Charles Schwab...

1438
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
...helps me keep an eye on
what's really important to me.

1439
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
It's packed with tools that
help me work my strategies,

1440
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
spot patterns and find
opportunities more easily.

1441
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
Then, when I'm ready...
act decisively.

1442
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
I can even access it from the
cloud and trade on any computer.

1443
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
With the exact same tools,
the exact same way.

1444
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
And the reality is,
with Schwab Mobile,

1445
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
TDD#: 1-800-345-2550
I can focus on trading
anyplace, anytime...

1446
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000

NEW REALITY IS SETTING IN.

I WAS FIGHTING BACK TEARS A

1504
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
LITTLE BIT TO DO IT.

1505
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
AND IT FELT, YOU KNOW, IT FELT

1506
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
GOOD.
IT FELT GOOD TO HONOR A FAMILY

01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
THEY SEEM LOOK A STRONG FAMILY.

1509
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I SPOKE TO THE OLDER BROTHER,

1510
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
AND, HE WAS DISTRAUGHT AS WELL.

1511
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
HE WAS -- HE COULDN'T SAY MUCH,

1512
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
JUST HOW HIS BROTHER WAS, HOW I

1513
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
WAS HIS BROTHER'S FAVORITE

1514
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
PLAYER.
AND HE WAS, YOU KNOW, HE WAS

1515
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000

BATTED HIS LONG EYELASHES.

1522
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
HE TRIED TO GET WHAT HE WANTED

1523
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
WITH HIS EYELASHES AND HE LIT UP

1524
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
EVERYONE'S HEART.

1525
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
>> NOAH WAS EXTREMELY LIVELY.

1526
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
HE WAS REALLY THE LIGHT OF THE

1527
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000

HE HAD A HUGE HEART, AND HE WAS

1529
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
SO MUCH FUN.

1530
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
A LITTLE BIT RAMBUNCTIOUS, LOTS

1531
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
OF SPIRIT.

1532
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
HE LOVED PLAYING WITH ALL OF HIS

1533
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
COUSINS.

1534
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
HE LOVED HIS TWIN THE MOST OF

1535
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000

1536
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000

WAS ASSIGNED TO A DIFFERENT

1541
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
CLASSROOM THAN HER BROTHER.

1542
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
ARIEL ESCAPED THE SHOOTING ALONG

THEY WERE ON THE SCENE.

1574
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
THEY MET THESE GRIEVING PARENTS

1575
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
IN THOSE MOMENTS OF CONFUSION

1576
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
AND SHOCK.
JUST A SHORT TIME AGO, AFTER I

1577

01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
WHAT DID YOU THINK IT WAS?

1621
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
>> NOT ON THE SCALE IT WAS.

1622
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
ONE OR TWO.

1623
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,000
WE HEARD THE PRINCIPAL AT FIRST,

1624
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
AND -- AS TIME WENT ON, WE GOT

1625
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
THE REPORTS.

1626
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
JUST DIDN'T BELIEVE IT.

1627
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
WE CAME DOWN THE ROAD.

1628
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
IT WAS JUST ALL SURREAL.

1629
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
SEEING ALL THE CARS.

1630
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
ALL THIS.

1631
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
TOUGH.

1632
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
>> WHERE DID YOU GO ONCE YOU SAW

1633
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
THE CARS?
STRAIGHT TO THE FIREHOUSE?

1634
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
>> STRAIGHT TO THE FIREHOUSE.

1635
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,000
FROM THERE WE JUST --

1636
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
>> HELP US AROUND THE WORLD

1637
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU AS A FIRST

1638
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
RESPONDER ARE GOING THROUGH.

1639
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,000
>> SADNESS, ANGER, GUILT IN SOME

1640
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
ASPECTS.

1641
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
>> WHY GUILT?

1642
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
WHAT COULD YOU HAVE DONE?

1643
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
>> EXACTLY.

1644
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I MEAN, WE'RE HAVING COUNSELING.

1645
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
AS A GROUP.

1646
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
>> CAN I GET YOUR FIRST AND LAST

1647
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
NAME?
>> NAME'S JEFFREY THOMAS.

1648
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
>> JEFFREY THOMAS.

1649
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

1650
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
>> SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

1651
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
>> FINALLY, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

1652
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
THE WREATHS, JUST PEOPLE YOU

1653
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
DON'T KNOW, SENDING YOU ALL

1654
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
THESE WREATHS TO PUT UP IN YOUR

1655
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
TOWN?

1656
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THE PEOPLE

1657
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
OF PORTLAND, OREGON?

1658
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
>> THANK YOU.
IT MAKES US FEEL WARM TO KNOW

1659
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
THIS IS -- IT IS AMAZING THAT

1660
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
PEOPLE THAT FAR AWAY CARE ABOUT

1661
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,000
US.

1662
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
>> SO MANY PEOPLE I KNOW CARE

1663
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
ABOUT THESE PEOPLE AND THE TOWN

1664
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
OF NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1665
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
SO MANY ISSUES THAT PEOPLE ARE

1666
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
WORKING THROUGH, IN THE

1667
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
AFTERMATH OF THIS TRAGEDY.

1668
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I WANT TO BRING IN PSYCHOLOGIST

1669
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
WENDY WALSH WHO JOINS ME FROM

1670
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
LOS ANGELES.

1671
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I WANT TO BEGIN WITH A POINT

1672
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
THAT THAT YOUNG FIREFIGHTER

1673
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
BROUGHT UP WITH ME, IT BROKE MY

1674
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
HEART TO HEAR HIM SAY GUILT.

1675
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
GUILT AS ONE OF THE EMOTIONS

1676
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
HE'S SORT OF COPING WITH.

1677
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
HOW DO THEY SORT THROUGH THESE

1678
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
EMOTIONS IN THE DAYS AFTER THE

1679
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
SHOOTING?
>> IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

1680
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
THAT SURVIVOR'S GUILT CAN HIT

1681
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
ANYBODY.
IT IS REALLY COMMON, BROOKE, IN

1682
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
FIRST RESPONDERS, BUT IT IS EVEN

1683
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
COMMON IN ALL OF US.

1684
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
YOU KNOW, WHEN I ASK PEOPLE HOW

1685
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
ARE YOU FEELING?

1686
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
EVEN MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES

1687
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
AT CNN WHEN I SAY HOW IS IT

1688
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
GOING?
THEY SAY, WELL, IT'S TERRIBLE,

1689
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
BUT NOT AS BAD AS THOSE PARENTS,

1690
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
LIKE SOMEHOW IT IS NOT OKAY FOR

1691
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
US TO FEEL AS SAD AS THOSE
PARENTS WHO FELT THE LOSS.

1692
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
OBVIOUSLY THEIR LOSS IS MORE

1693
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
REAL, IT WILL LAST A LONGER

1694
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
TIME, BUT THIS COMMUNITY

1695
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
GRIEVING, WE SHOULD ALL GIVE

1696
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
OURSELVES TIME FOR.

1697
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

1698
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
ALLOW OURSELVES TIME TO GRIEVE

1699
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE HEALING

1700
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
WORK IS DONE.

1701
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
>> YEAH, YOU TALK ABOUT

1702
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
SURVIVOR'S GUILT.
WE HEAR THE STORIES OF PEOPLE IN

1703
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
NEWTOWN WHOSE CHILDREN WERE IN

1704
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
CLASSES ACROSS THE WALL OR

1705
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
LITTLE ONE PLAYED DEAD AMIDST

1706
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
THE YOUNG FOLKS WHO DIDN'T MAKE

1707
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
IT.
AND THAT PERSON SURVIVED AND

1708
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
THESE PARENTS WALKING AROUND

1709
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
SORT OF WITH HEAVY HEARTS.

1710
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
THEY FEEL GUILTY AS WELL.

1711
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
BUT ALSO JUST, WENDY, I KNOW

1712
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD, YOU

1713
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
KNOW, I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS,

1714
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
PEOPLE HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS, THEY

1715
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
HAVEN'T HAD A DRY EYE IN DAYS.

1716
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
HOW DO YOU ADVISE THEM AS THEY

1717
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
MOVE FORWARD?

1718
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, WE ALL DEAL

1719
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
WITH THIS KIND OF EMOTIONAL

1720
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
TRAUMA IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

1721
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,000
SOME PEOPLE NEED TO BE ACTIVE.

1722
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
THE EXTRA VE

1723
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
OTHERS NEED TO DISTRACT

1724
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
THEMSELVES AND SAYING WHY ARE

1725
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
THEY BEING SO OBLIVIOUS, DON'T

1726
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND

1727
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
BUSY THEMSELVES WITH OTHER

1728
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
THINGS.

1729
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
THAT'S WHY AROUND FUNERALS,

1730
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
THERE IS A LOT OF FOOD

1731
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
PREPARATION AND BRINGING OF FOOD

1732
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU SOMETHING

1733
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
TO DO.
STILL, OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE NUMB

1734
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
FOR A WHILE UNTIL A TIDAL WAVE

1735
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
OF SADNESS MAY SHOW UP.

1736
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
OTHER PEOPLE MAY JUST FEEL

1737
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
IRRITABLE AND ANGRY AND NOT KNOW

1738
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
WHY.

1739
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
YOU SEE THOSE PEOPLE COMING OUT

1740
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
IN GIANT DEBATE OVER GUN

1741
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
CONTROL.
EITHER SIDE OF THE ISSUE,

1742
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
THEY'RE QUITE ANGRY RIGHT NOW.

1743
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
SO THESE ARE ALL SYMPTOMS OF THE

1744
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
TRAUMA.
AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO JUST SORT

1745
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
OF ALLOW OURSELVES TO HAVE IT

1746
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
FOR A TIME, BUT IT IS ALSO

1747
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOT ACT,

1748
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
THINK OR TALK OUT OF A PLACE

1749
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
FROM FEAR, A PLACE OF FEAR.

1750
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ALLOW

1751
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
OUR BEHAVIORS TO BE GOVERNED BY

1752
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
LOVE.

1753
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
AND GOOD ACTS.

1754
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
AND LIKE THE WREATHS YOU SHOWED

1755
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
THAT WERE BLIZZARDE EDELIVERED

1756
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
THE FIREFIGHTERS AND THE PEOPLE
IN PORTLAND, TOO.

1757
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
>> I ALWAYS SAY IT IS THE LITTLE

1758
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
THINGS AND IT WAS PRETTY AMAZING

1759
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
WATCHING THE FIREFIGHTERS SORT

1760
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
OF HANGING THESE WREATHS AROUND

1761
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
TOWN AND THEY KNEW SOMEONE, ALL

1762
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
THE WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

1763
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
CARED ENOUGH ABOUT THEM AND YOU

1764
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
CAN JUST TELL IT MEANT THE WORLD
TO THEM.

1765
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE.

1766
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
THERE WAS A PRETTY STUNNING

1767
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
PIECE, FROM THE BLUE REVIEW,

1768
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
PUBLISHED TODAY IN THE

HER NAME IS LIZA LONG.

1774
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
SHE TALKS ABOUT HER BRIGHT BUT

1775
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
TROUBLED 13-YEAR-OLD SON WHO AT

1776
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
TIMES HAS PULLED A KNIFE ON HER,

THREATENED TO KILL HER,

1778
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
THREATENED TO KILL HIMSELF.

1779
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I WANT TO QUOTE HER HERE.

1780
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
SHE WROTE, NO ONE WANTS TO SEND

1781
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
A 13-YEAR-OLD GENIUS WHO LOVES

1782
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
HARRY POTTER AND HIS SNUGGLE

1783
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
ANIMAL COLLECTION TO JAIL.

1784
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
BUT OUR SOCIETY WITH ITS STIGMA

1785
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
ON MENTAL ILLNESS AND ITS BROKEN

1786
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM DOES NOT

1787
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
PROVIDE US WITH OTHER OPTIONS.

1788
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
THEN ANOTHER TORTURED SOUL

1789
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
SHOOTS UP A FAST FOOD

1790
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
RESTAURANT.
A MALL.

1791
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
A KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM.

1792
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
AND WE WRITTEN OUR HANDS AND SAY

1793
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
SOMETHING MUST BE DONE.

1794
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT?

1795
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
>> YOU KNOW, SHE'S DEAD ON.

1796
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
AS THE CONVERSATION HAS BEEN

1797
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL, AND THAT'S A

1798
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
VERY VALID CONVERSATION TO BE

01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
HAVING IN THESE TIMES, I THINK

1800
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT MENTAL

1801
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000

1802
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
IMPORTANT HERE.

1803
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000

1804
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
ARIZONA SHOOTER, YOU KNOW, WHO

1805
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
WAS EXHIBITING EARLY SIGNS OF

1806
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
SCHIZOPHRENIA, HE WAS OVER THE

1807
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
AGE OF 18, ONCE YOU'RE OVER THE

1808
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
AGE OF 18, NOBODY CAN MAKE YOU
GO TO A PSYCHIATRIST.

1809
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
NOBODY CAN MAKE YOU TAKE YOUR

1810
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
MEDS.
PARENTS LOVE THEIR CHILD, SO THE

1811
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
BEST THING THEY CAN DO IS GIVE A

1812
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
ROOF OVER HIS HEAD AND FOOD.

1813
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE

1814
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE --

1815
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
WE'RE SO FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUAL

1816
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000

1817

COURSE DENYING SOMEONE THEIR

1818
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
FREEDOM IS A BAD THING AND

1819
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000

BECAUSE THEY HAD STRANGE

1822

SOMETHING IN THE '20s.

1825
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000

01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
>> I KNEW TEN OF THEM.

1977
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
TEN OF THE KIDS WERE IN MY CLASS

1978
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
LAST YEAR.

1979
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
WHEN I HEARD THE NAMES, IT IS

1980
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
TOUGH.

1981
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
IT'S TOUGH.

1982
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I WAS WANTING TO ATTEND SOME OF

1983
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
THE SERVICES.

1984
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I'M SURE SOME FAMILIES WANT

1985
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
PRIVACY.

1986
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
THERE IS A FEW CHILDREN WHO I'VE

1987
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
HAD, NOT JUST THEM, I'VE HAD

1988
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
THEIR SIBLINGS, AND IN ONE CASE

1989
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I'VE HAD ALL THREE.

1990
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000

[ Male Announcer ] When Ziggy
the cat appeared at their door,

he opened up
Jake's very private world.

2040
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
At first, Jake's family
thought they saved Ziggy,

2041
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
but his connection with Jake
has been a lifesaver.

2042
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,000
For a love this strong,
his family only feeds him Iams.

Compared to other
leading brands,

2044
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
it has 50% more
animal protein...

2045
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
...to help keep Ziggy's body
as strong as a love

2046
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
that reaches further
than anyone's words.

THE MEETING THIS TIME WAS ABOUT

OVER THE WEEKEND, THE SPEAKER

PROPOSING A PEACEFUL END TO HIS

COUNTRY'S CIVIL WAR.

2085
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
HE'S SAYING GOVERNMENT FORCES

2086
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
CAN'T WIN AND NEITHER CAN THE

2087
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
REBELS.

2088
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
WE'LL HAVE THE STORY NOW FROM

2090
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
HERE'S CNN'S NIC ROBERTSON.

2091
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
>> THIS IS PRETTY STRONG STUFF

2092
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
COMING FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT.

2093
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
WE HAVEN'T HEARD THIS LANGUAGE

2094
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
FROM ANYONE CLOSE TO THE SORT OF

2095
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
INNER CIRCLE.

2096
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
WHY SHOULD WE LISTEN TO FAROUK

2097
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
AL SHARAA.

2098
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
HE WAS THE FOREIGN MINISTER IN

2099
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
THE COUNTRY.

2100
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
SINCE THEN, THE VICE PRESIDENT.

2101
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
HE'S BEEN UNDER HOUSE ARREST

2102
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
SINCE THE SUMMER.

2103
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS HE WAS

2104
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
FLEEING THE COUNTRY.

2105
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
THOSE PROVED NOT TO BE TRUE.

2106
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
SO HE'S NOT SOMEBODY WHO IS
RIGHT AT THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF

2107
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
BASHAR AL ASSAD RIGHT NOW.

2108
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNUSUAL IN

2109
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
THE CIRCUMSTANCES RIGHT NOW TO

2110
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
HAVE SOMEBODY OF HIS STATURE

2111
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
SAYING IT IS TIME FOR UNITY

2112
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
GOVERNMENT.
HE GOES BEYOND THAT BY SAYING,

2113
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
CRITICIZING BASHAR AL ASSAD

2114
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,000
SAYING ASSAD ONLY WANTS TO HAVE

2115
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
A POLITICAL SOLUTION AFTER A

2116
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
MILITARY VICTORY.

2117
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
AND HE SAYS THERE ARE PEOPLE IN

2118
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
BASHAR AL ASSAD'S BAATH PARTY

2119
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
THAT ACTUALLY SUPPORT A

2120
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
POLITICAL SOLUTION NOW.

2121
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
THAT PARTY LEADERS AROUND THE

2122
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
COUNTRY, THE DEPARTMENTAL HEADS

2123
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
AROUND THE COUNTRY, ONLY DO WHAT

2124
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
BASHAR AL ASSAD SAYS.

2125
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
HE BLAMES ASSAD FOR THAT.

2126
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
HE SAID ASSAD LET THE ECONOMY OF

2127
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
THE COUNTRY RUN DOWN.

2128
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
THAT THAT'S THE REASON THAT

2129
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
THESE PROTESTS BEGAN.

2130
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
THAT BASHAR AL ASSAD IGNORED THE

2131
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
PROTESTERS AND THAT'S WHY IT

2132
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
TURNED TO VIOLENCE.
HE'S LAYING A LOT AT THE FEET OF

2133
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
THE PRESIDENT HERE.

2134
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
AND THIS DOES REALLY SEEM TO BE

2135
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'RE

2136
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
GETTING INSIGHT FROM SOMEBODY

2137
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
CLOSE TO THE INNER CIRCLE THAT

2138
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
IS CALLING OUT AND SAYING IT IS

2139
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
TIME FOR CHANGE.

2140
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
HE SAYS THAT IF ASSAD DOESN'T

2141
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
CHANGE, FIND SOME AGREEMENT WITH

2142
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
THE OPPOSITION RIGHT NOW, IT

2143
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
WILL BE TAKEN OUT OF HIS HANDS

2144
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
AND INTO THE OPPOSITION WILL

2145
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
HAVE THEIR WAY.

2146
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
AND HE ALSO GOES ON TO CRITICIZE

2147
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
THE REBELS AND SAYS ANYONE WHO

2148
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
SITS DOWN AT THE TABLE NOW AND

2149
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
EXPECTS TO GET EVERYTHING THAT

2150
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
THEY WANT, THEN FORGET IT.

2151
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
HE SAID THIS COUNTRY WILL

2152
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
CONTINUE TO BE AT WAR.

2153
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
THERE WILL BE FURTHER BLOODSHED

2154
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
AND FURTHER SUFFERING.

2155
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
SO HE'S PAINTING A VERY DARK

01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
SCENARIO, BUT HE'S LAYING IT AT

AND THE TIME TO DO THAT IS RIGHT

2160
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000

01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
>> INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT.

2162
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
A CRACK PERHAPS INSIDE THE

POIGNANT STATEMENT HERE, POINTED

2171
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL SPECIFICALLY

2172
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
AS SHE'S TALKING THERE TO DANA

2173
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
BASH.
SHE IS PUSHING FOR A BAN ON

HIS CONVERSATION WITH FRIENDS OF

THE GUNMAN'S MOTHER.
THAT'S NEXT.

2180
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
It's hard to see opportunity

2181
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
in today's challenging
environment.

2182
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Unless you have the right
perspective.

2183
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
BNY Mellon Wealth Management
has the vision

2184
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
and experience to look beyond
the obvious.

2185
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,000
We'll uncover opportunities,
find hidden risk,

2186
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
and make success a reality.

2187
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,000
BNY Mellon Wealth Management

2188
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
trying to find a better job can
Likbe frustrating.gs,

2189
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
So at University of Phoenix
we're working with a growing

2190
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
list of almost two thousand
corporate partners -

2191
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
companies like Microsoft,
American Red Cross and Adobe -

2192
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
to create options for you.

2193
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Not only that, we're using what
we learn from these partners

2194
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
to shape our curriculum, so that
when you find the job you want

2195
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
you'll be a perfect fit.

2196
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Let's get to work.

2197
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
>>> THIS IS NEWTOWN,

2198

FUNERALS BEGIN.

IN FACT, ONE IS BEGINNING JUST

2201
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
ACROSS THE STREET.

2202
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
THIS IS THE ONLY UNDERTAKER IN

2203
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
THIS TOWN OF SOME 27,000 PEOPLE.

2204

01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000

TASK OF MASKING SOME OF THE

2208
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
WOUNDS FROM FRIDAY'S SHOOTING.

2209
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
AND WE'RE TOLD, THINK ABOUT

2210
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
THESE TINY CASKETS, SOME WILL BE

2211
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
OPEN, SOME WILL BE CLOSED.

2212
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
WHAT IS HAPPENING ALL AROUND ME

2213
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000

01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
JUST TOLD ME THROUGH TEARS THERE

01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
JUST DRIVING AROUND NEWTOWN, YOU

01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000

01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000

2224
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000

01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
FOR A TOWN.

2228
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,000
WE NOTICED IN THE MIDDLE OF PART

2229
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
OF TOWN A FLAG, THE BIG FLAG IS

2230
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
NOW FLYING AT HALF-STAFF.

2231
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
THIS IS THE FIREHOUSE HERE WHERE

2232
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
A LOT OF THE FAMILIES HUDDLED

2233
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
FRIDAY MORNING, LEARNING THE

2234
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
FATES OF THEIR LITTLE SONS AND

2235
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
DAUGHTERS.

2236
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
WE CAN'T CROSS THE STREET.

2237
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
YOU CAN SEE THE SIGN HERE, NO

2238
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
MEDIA BEYOND THIS POINT.

2239
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
WE CAN'T GET INSIDE THE

2240
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
FIREHOUSE.
MANY OF THESE FIRST RESPONDERS

2241
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
STILL VERY MUCH SO REELING OVER

2242
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
WHAT THEY SAW, WHAT THEY

2243
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
RESPONDED TO FRIDAY.

2244
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
WANT TO READ YOU A QUOTE, FROM A

2245
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER, 39 YEARS

2246
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
HERE, HE SAID I'VE SEEN SOME

2247
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
HORRENDOUS THINGS IN 39 YEARS AS

2248
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
A FIREFIGHTER.

2249
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I WENT

2250
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
HOME AND CRIED.

2251
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I DID MANAGE TO TALK TO TWO

2252
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
YOUNGER FIREFIGHTERS HERE AND

2253
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
THEY TOLD ME REALLY THE

2254
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
PRIORITY, BEYOND THE COMMUNITY,

2255
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
THE GRIEF COUNSELORS, TO HELP

2256
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,000
THEM COPE WITH WHAT THEY SAW.

2257
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
SO THAT WAS JUST A LOOK AROUND

2258
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
THE TOWN.

2259
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
DON LEMON JOINS ME.

2260
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR A COUPLE OF

2261
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
DAYS.

2262
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I JUST CAN'T -- ALL THE ANGELS

2263
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
IN PEOPLE'S FRONT YARDS AND THE

2264
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
BALLOONS AND THE CHRISTMAS TREES

2265
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
AND THE RIBBONS, IT IS

2266
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
EVERYWHERE YOU TURN.

2267
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
AND IN MEMORIAL OF THE LITTLE

2268
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
LIVES LOST.
YOU WANT TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE

2269
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
GUNMAN, ABOUT HIS MOTHER, WHAT

2270
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
ARE YOU LEARNING?

2271
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
>> WELL, NOT THAT, YOU KNOW,

2272
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
EVERY TIME THERE IS SOMETHING

2273
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
LIKE THIS, YOU WANT TO SHY AWAY

2274
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,000
FROM MAKING THAT PERSON FAMOUS,

2275
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
BUT THERE ARE SOME CLUES TO HIS

2276
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
ACTIONS, POSSIBLY, AND TO FIND

2277
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
OUT WHY --

2278
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
>> WHY.
>> WHY, WHICH IS WHAT EVERYONE

2279
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
IS ASKING.

2280
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE PEOPLE WHO

2281
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
KNEW HIM.

2282
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
HIS MOTHER'S FRIENDS, I TALKED

2283
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
TO THEM ABOUT THE MOTHER,

2284
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT

2285
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
HER, I ASKED THEM ABOUT HIM.

2286
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
WHAT WAS HE LIKE?

2287
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
WERE THERE ANY WARNING SIGNS?

2288
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,000
LISTEN.

2289
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
YOU KNEW ADAM?

2290
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
>> YEAH.
>> WHAT ABOUT HIM?

2291
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,000
>> HE DID HAVE ASPERGER'S

2292
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
SYNDROME.
HE, LIKE MANY KIDS THAT HAVE

2293
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
THAT, HE WAS VERY WITHDRAWN,

2294
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
EMOTIONALLY.

2295
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,000
BUT HE HAD -- HE WAS AN ORGANIC

2296
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
VEGAN AND NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW

2297
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
THAT.

2298
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
AND HE TOOK THAT STANCE BECAUSE

2299
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
OF MORAL STANCE ABOUT ANIMALS

2300
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
PROVIDING HIS FOOD.

2301
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
HE DIDN'T WANT TO REQUIRE THEM

2302
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
TO MAKE THAT SACRIFICE.

2303
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
HE BELIEVED THAT NOTHING SHOULD

2304
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,000
HAVE TO DIE SO HE COULD LIVE.

2305
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:46,000
SO IT MAKES THE ENORMITY OF THIS

2306
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
TRAGEDY EVEN MORE BIZARRE,

2307
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
BECAUSE HE WAS NOT VIOLENT.

2308
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
HE DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

2309
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
ANYBODY.

2310
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:58,000
HE WAS VERY RECLUSIVE.

2311
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
HE WAS VERY PRIVATE IN TERMS OF

2312
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:06,000
HOW HE VIEWED HIMSELF AND HE WAS

2313
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:11,000
ALWAYS TRYING TO BE VERY

2314
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
INCONSPICUOUS, EVEN IN PUBLIC.

2315
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
HE DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE THEM --

2316
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
HIMSELF THE CENTER OF ATTENTION.

2317
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
HE NEVER WAS -- ALWAYS A VERY

2318
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
QUIET KID.

2319
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
>> HE WASN'T A BAD KID.

2320
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
>> NO.

2321
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
NOT AT ALL.
>> HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS?

2322
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
>> I DON'T.

2323
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I THINK WE'RE ALL -- WE'RE ALL

2324
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:30,000
DOWN HERE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS.

2325
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:36,000
>> SO HE'S QUIET, HE'S A LONE

2326
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
E

2327
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
ER, RECLUSIVE.
THOSE ARE THE SIGNS OF --

2328
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
THEY'RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE,

2329
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
BUT THOSE ARE THE SIGNS THAT

2330
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS AND THAT PROFILERS

2331
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
WILL TELL YOU THAT MIGHT LEAD

2332
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
PEOPLE TO -- SO THEY -- THERE

2333
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
WERE SOME WARNING SIGNS THERE,

2334
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
BUT DIDN'T THINK THERE WERE ANY

2335
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
WARNING SIGNS THERE.

2336
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
ALSO, THEY SAID, THEY DON'T

2337
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
BELIEVE HE HAD ANY CONNECTION TO

2338
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

2339
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
BUT HE DID GO TO SANDY HOOK HIGH

2340
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
SCHOOL.
SO, BUT NO CONNECTION, THEY

2341
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
BELIEVE TO THE --

2342
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
>> TALKING TO AN EXPERT A MOMENT

2343
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
AGO AND HIS POINT WAS THAT IF

2344
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
YOU GET TO A POINT, YOU DO NOT

2345
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
DISTINGUISH CHILDREN VERSUS

2346
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:10,000
ADULTS, PERHAPS, IN THIS CASE.

2347
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
NO ONE WILL FULLY UNDERSTAND

2348
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
WHY.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS NEW

2349
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
POLL.
TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS HERE,

2350
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
A NEW POLL, TAKEN AFTER FRIDAY'S

2351
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
SHOOTINGS AND YOU LOOK AT THE

2352
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
NUMBER HERE IN A MOMENT.

2353
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
44% OF AMERICANES SAY THEY

2354
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
STRONGLY SUPPORT STRICTER GUN

2355
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
CONTROL LAWS.

2356
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
THAT IS UP JUST A LITTLE BIT

2357
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
FROM 39% BACK IN AUGUST.

2358
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
THAT WAS AFTER THE AURORA

2359
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
THEATER SHOOTINGS IN COLORADO.

2360
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,000
THE ABC "WASHINGTON POST" SURVEY

2361
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
SHOWS 32% OPPOSE STRICTER GUN

2362
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
CONTROL LAWS, THAT'S DOWN FROM

2363
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
37% IN AUGUST.

2364
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
THE PUSH FOR NEW GUN CONTROL

2365
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
LAWS ALREADY IN THE WORKS.

2366
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
DIANNE FEINSTEIN PLANS TO

2367
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
REINTRODUCE HER ASSAULT BAN --

2368
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN LEGISLATION.

2369
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
WE TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT THAT.

2370
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
ALSO NEW JERSEY SENATOR FRANK

2371
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
LAUTENBERG PLANS A BILL THAT

2372
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
WOULD BAN THE SALE OF HIGH

2373
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
CAPACITY MAGAZINES.

2374
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

2375
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
>> WHY DO YOU THINK THIS MOMENT

2376
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
MAY BE DIFFERENT?

2377
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
>> BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A

2378
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
LOGICAL CONTINUUM.

2379
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
IF THERE SHOULD BE A SAFE PLACE

2380
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
IN AMERICA, IT IS AN ELEMENTARY

2381
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
SCHOOL.
AND HERE IN THIS ELEMENTARY

2382
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
SCHOOL, LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.

2383
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
6-YEAR-OLDS WITH 3 TO 11 BULLETS

2384
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
FROM THIS BUSHMASTER IN THEIR

2385
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
BODY, 20 OF THEM.

2386
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
IS THIS AMERICA?

2387
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
I DON'T THINK SO.

2388
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
AND I THINK THESE INCIDENTS ARE

2389
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
GOING TO CONTINUE UNTIL WE DO

2390
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
SOMETHING TO CHANGE THE SUPPLY

2391
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
MODE OF THESE WEAPONS OUT IN OUR

2392
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:43,000
SOCIETY.

2393
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
>> IT IS A GRUESOME IMAGE TO

2394
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
THINK ABOUT.

2395
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
BUT HOW SHE SAID, THIS IS

2396
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
AMERICA.

2397
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I DON'T THINK SO.
HERE YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT HERE

2398
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
IN TOWN, JUST LAST NIGHT,

2399
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
SPEAKING AT THE HIGH SCHOOL,

2400
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU LISTEN TO

2401
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
HIM, HE DIDN'T GO INTO

2402
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
SPECIFICS, BUT HE CERTAINLY SAID

2403
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
THAT GUN VIOLENCE, KILLING

2404
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
AMERICA'S YOUTH MUST SOP.

2405
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
.
>> WE CAN'T TOLERATE THIS

2406
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
ANYMORE.

2407
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,000
THESE TRAGEDIES MUST END.

2408
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:16,000
AND TO END THEM WE MUST CHANGE.

2409
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
>> SO SUPPORTERS OF GUN RIGHTS,

2410
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
THEY SEEM TO BE SAYING, YOU

2411
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
KNOW, YES, WE NEED MORE GUNS,

2412
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT

2413
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
MOMENTUM IS REALLY SHIFTING.

2414
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
>> HERE'S THE THING.

2415
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
CAN WE GO BACK TO WHAT DIANNE

2416
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
FEINSTEIN --

2417
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
>> HOW ABOUT WHAT SHE SAID.

2418
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
>> HERE'S THE THING.

2419
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
>> YEAH.
>> IF YOU ASK -- LISTEN, WE'RE

2420
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
COMING OFF OF 20 KIDS BEING

2421
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
SHOT.
THESE ARE 6 AND 7-YEAR-OLDS.

2422
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
THESE ARE KIDS WHO, AS I'VE BEEN

2423
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
SAYING, GOING TO BOLT DOWN THE

2424
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
STAIRS IN A FEW DAYS TO SEE WHAT

2425
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
SANTA BROUGHT THEM.

2426
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
THINK ABOUT THAT.
>> RIGHT.

2427
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
>> DOES YOUR RIGHT -- DO YOU

2428
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
BELIEVE YOUR RIGHT TO OWN A GUN

2429
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
OR AN ASSAULT WEAPON, WE'RE NOT

2430
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
TALKING ABOUT TAKING AWAY

2431
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,000
PEOPLE'S GUNS, AN ASSAULT WEAPON

2432
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
OR AUTOMATIC RIVFLE, DOES THAT

2433
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
TRUMP MY RIGHT TO BE IN A MOVIE

2434
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
THEATER AND FEEL SAFE, A 6 AND

2435
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
7-YEAR-OLD TO SIT IN A CLASSROOM

2436
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
AND FEEL SAFE?

2437
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I DON'T THINK SO.

2438
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
SO THAT'S THE CONVERSATION WE

2439
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
NEED TO HAVE.

2440
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
AND WHEN SOMEONE SAYS, OH, WELL,

2441
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
PEOPLE WHO SAY WE NEED TO LOOK

2442
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
AT THE GUN LAWS ARE TRYING TO

2443
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
TAKE AWAY THE SECOND AMENDMENT

2444
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
RIGHT, NOT AT ALL.

2445
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
BUT IN THE WAKE OF CHILDREN

2446
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
BEING SLAUGHTERED IN AN

2447
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, IF WE'RE NOT

2448
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT NOW, WHEN

2449
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
THE HECK ARE WE GOING TO TALK

2450
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
ABOUT IT?
IT IS DISRESPECTFUL NOT TO DO IT

2451
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
AT THIS POINT.

2452
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I THINK IT WOULD BE

2453
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
DISRESPECTFUL NOT ONLY --

2454
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
>> SOME PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED

2455
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION
AT ALL AND TRYING TO POLITICIZE

2456
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
IT OR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE

2457
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
TRYING TO POLITICIZE IT.

2458
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
BUT I AGREE.

2459
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
>> WE'RE VERY GOOD AT LIGHTING

IT WILL BE ANOTHER SHOOTING, A

2464
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
HURRICANE, A TWISTER.

2465
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000

01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
GOVERNMENT ALREADY SPENDS TOO

2513
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
MUCH.

2514
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
SO THE QUESTION IS NOT REALLY

2515
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
ABOUT WHETHER MILLIONAIRES OR

2516
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
THOSE MAKING MORE THAN $250,000

2517
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
A YEAR WILL PAY HIGHER RATES,

2518
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
THE REAL CONVERSATION BOILS DOWN

2519
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,000
TO THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT.

2520
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
FAREED ZAKARIA WERE DISCUSSING

2521
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
MY CONTENTION WE SHOULD BE LESS

2522
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
CONCERNED WITH ACTUAL RATES AND

2523
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
BE HAVING MORE OF A DISCUSSION

2524
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
ABOUT THE VALUE THAT AMERICANS

2525
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
GET FOR THEIR TAX DOLLARS.

2526
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
>> HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH THAT.

2527
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
AMERICANS LIKE GOVERNMENT.

2528
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
SO WHAT WE HAVE FOR THE LAST 30

2529
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
YEARS, DON, IS SAY WE'RE GOING

2530
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
TO HAVE LOW TAXES, BUT WE STILL

2531
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
WANT LOTS OF GOVERNMENT.

2532
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
WE MADE UP THAT DIFFERENCE BY

2533
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
BORROWING.

2534
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
>> SPEAKING OF VALUE FOR YOUR

2535
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
TAXES, LOOK AT THIS LIST OF

2536
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
COUNTRIES RATED ON A 1 TO 10

2537

LOOK AT THE TOP TAX RATES IN

2543
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
THESE COUNTRIES.

2544
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
AMERICANS PAY 41.7% WHEN YOU

2545
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
FACTOR IN FEDERAL, STATE AND

2546
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
LOCAL TAXES.

2547
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
DANS ARE HAPPY BUT PAY MORE,

2548
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
48%.

2549
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
WHY?
IN PART BECAUSE THEIR TAXES GET

2550
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
THEM FREE HEALTH CARE AND POST

2551
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
SECONDARY EDUCATION.

2552
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
SO, PERHAPS A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE

2553
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
CONVERSATION SHOULD CENTER ON

2554
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
HOW MUCH WE EXPECT TO BENEFIT

2555
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
FROM GOVERNMENT SERVICES, AND

2556
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
HOW MUCH WE'RE WILLING TO PAY

2557
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
FOR THOSE SERVICES.

2558
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
NOW, THE NEGOTIATION BETWEEN

2559
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER AND PRESIDENT

2560
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
OBAMA HAVE GIVEN US A NEW TERM

2561
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
OVER WHICH TO OBSESS, CHAIN CPI.

2562
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
IT WOULD CHANGE THE WAY THE

2563
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CALCULATES

2564
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
INFLATION AND THOSE BENEFITS

2565
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
THAT ARE TIED TO IT.

2566
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
NORMALLY EVERY YEAR BOTH WAGES

2567
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
AND PRICES GO UP.

2568
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX OR CPI

2569
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
MEASURES HOW MUCH PRICES GO UP

2570
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:51,000
BY TRACKING A BASKET OF GOODS

2571
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
THAT AMERICANS TYPICALLY BUY.

2572
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
THIS IS USED TO CALCULATE COST

2573
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS ON SOCIAL

2574
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000

2575
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000

2576
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
YEAR AS PRICES FOR WHAT WE NEED

2577
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
GO UP.

2578
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
ONE POTENTIAL FLAW IN THE SYSTEM

2579
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:07,000
IS THAT CPI ASSUMES PEOPLE DON'T

2580
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
CHANGE THE THINGS IN THE BASKET.

2581
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
IF YOU'RE EATING MORE CHICKEN

2582
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
BECAUSE THE PRICE OF BEEF HAS

2583
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
SHOT UP, CPI DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR

2584
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
THAT.
CHAIN CPI CREATES A CHAINED

2585
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
BASKETS OF GOODS TO MEASURE

2586
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
INFLATION MORE ACCURATELY.

2587
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
IT IS MEASURING HOW PEOPLE

2588
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
ACTUALLY REACT TO PRICE CHANGES,

2589
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,000
NOT SIMPLY THE FACT THAT PRICES

2590
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,000
HAVE CHANGED.

2591
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
CHAIN CPI WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE

2592
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
FACT YOU ARE BUYING MORE

2593
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
CHICKEN, WHEN BEEF BECOMES TOO

2594
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
EXPENSIVE.

2595
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
NOW THAT COULD RESULT IN A

2596
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000

WHAT PEOPLE EARN.

2601
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,000

01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS LIKE TO SEE

2693
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:15,000
THESE PARENTS AS I DID ON

2694
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
FRIDAY, LAST NIGHT, GOING FROM

2695
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
ROOM TO ROOM, AND THEN AGAIN

2696
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:24,000
WITH RESPECT TO NOAH'S PARENTS

2697
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
TODAY.

2698
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
IT IS TOUGH TO SEE RELATIVES AND

2699
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
FRIENDS OF THESE LITTLE

2700
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,000
CHILDREN, WHO DIED, AND AS WELL

2701
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
AS TO SEE SOME OF THE TEACHERS

2702
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
WHO HAVE BEEN SO ADVERSELY

2703
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
IMPACTED.
THE REALITY WITH RESPECT TO THE

2704
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
RELATIVES AS YOU TRY TO FEEL

2705
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
THEIR PAIN, BUT YOU CAN'T, YOU

2706
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
TRY TO FIND SOME WORDS THAT YOU

2707
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:49,000
HOPE WILL BE ADEQUATE, KNOWING

2708
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
THAT THEY'LL BE INADEQUATE AND
YOU SEE LITTLE COFFINS AND YOUR

2709
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
HEART HAS TO ACHE.

2710
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
SO YOU TELL THEM, YOU GRIEVE FOR

2711
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
THEIR LOSS, YOU GIVE THEM A HUG

2712
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
AND YOU TELL THEM THAT THEIR

2713
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,000
COMMUNITY, THEIR STATE, AND

2714
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
THEIR NATION, DARE I SAY THE

2715
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
WHOLE WORLD, STANDS WITH THEM

2716
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,000
AND YOU HOPE THAT THAT MAKES

2717
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
SOME DIFFERENCE.
PAST FEW DAYS HAVE OBVIOUSLY

2718
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
BEEN VERY DIFFICULT ONES FOR

2719
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
ANYONE LIVING IN THE STATE OF

2720
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
CONNECTICUT OR AWARE OF THESE

2721
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,000
PARTICULARLY HEINOUS

2722
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
CIRCUMSTANCES.

2723
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
AS I SAID IN MY TELEVISED

2724
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
REMARKS ON SATURDAY NIGHT, YOU

2725
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
SEE THESE TRAGEDIES PLAY OUT IN

2726
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
OTHER PLACES, AND YOU HOPE AND

2727
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,000
YOU EXPECT THAT IT WILL NEVER

2728
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
HAPPEN IN YOUR HOME, BUT CLEARLY

2729
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,000
IT DID IN CONNECTICUT.

2730
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I WILL REPEAT SOMETHING I SAID

2731
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,000
ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.

2732
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
THE FAMILIES OF THOSE VICTIMS,

2733
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR RELATIVES,

2734
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
THE BRAVE TEACHERS AND

2735
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
ADMINISTRATORS AT THE SCHOOL WHO

2736
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
SURVIVED AND THE CHILDREN WHO

2737
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
SURVIVED, TO ALL OF THEM, LET

2738
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
US -- LET ME SAY ON BEHALF OF

2739
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT WE

2740
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
STAND READY TO ASSIST YOU IN ANY

2741
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
WAY POSSIBLE, IN ANY WAY NEEDED

2742
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
TO HELP YOU HEAL.

2743
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,000
SO MANY RESOURCES ALREADY

2744
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
BEING -- SO MANY RESOURCES ARE

2745
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
ALREADY BEING BROUGHT TO BEAR,

2746
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
BUT WE WILL BRING MORE, WHATEVER

2747
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
IS NECESSARY, AND DO WHATEVER

2748
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,000
HAS TO BE DONE TO HELP OUR STATE

2749
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:15,000
AND THE COMMUNITY OF NEWTOWN AND

2750
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
SPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOOD OF SANDY

2751
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
HOOK HEAL.

2752
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
TO THAT END, AND THIS IS FOR ALL

2753
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
OF OUR CITIZENS, NOT JUST ON A

2754
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
GEOGRAPHIC BASIS, ANYONE WHO IS

2755
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000

2756
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
CONNECTICUT, CALL 211, IT IS A

2757
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
CRISIS LINE, IT IS AVAILABLE ON

2758
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
A STATE WIDE BASIS, IT IS
AVAILABLE 24 HOURS A DAY TO

2759
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
CONNECT FAMILIES WITH RESOURCES

2760
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
THAT THEY NEED TO GET THROUGH

2761
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.

2762
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
AND IT IS STAFFED BY PEOPLE WHO

2763
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
IT IS STAFFED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE

2764
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,000
TRAINED SPECIALISTS IN HANDLING

2765
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
THESE SITUATIONS.

2766
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,000
WE'VE USED THE UNITED WAY AND

2767
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
211 TO HELP COORDINATE THE MANY

2768
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
OFFERS OF SERVICES THAT ARE

2769
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,000
POURING IN TO OUR STATE.

2770
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,000
AND WE WILL USE MANY OF THOSE

2771
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
RESOURCES I'M SURE.

2772
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
I WANT TO AGAIN THANK THE

2773
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,000
PRESIDENT FOR HAVING COME TO THE

2774
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
STATE AND HAVING PLEDGED TO

2775
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,000
PROVIDE ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL

2776
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
GOVERNMENT THE PRESENCE THAT WE

2777
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
NEEDED IN NEWTOWN AND ANY

2778
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
ADDITIONAL SERVICES.

2779
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
I ALSO WANT TO COMMENT THAT HE

2780
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
WAS ELOQUENT, HE WAS MOVING, HE

2781
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
WAS HEALING AND HE WAS POWERFUL.

2782
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,000
I THINK I CAN SPEAK ON BEHALF OF

2783
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,000
EVERYONE WHEN I SAY WE'RE

2784
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,000
GRATEFUL FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND

2785
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
OBVIOUS THAT HE IS CONCERNED

2786
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
ABOUT OUR STATE AND OUR PEOPLE

2787
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
AND I'M MOST APPRECIATIVE OF

2788
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
THAT.
I WANT TO THANK THE FIRST

2789
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
RESPONDERS.
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR NOW THAT THEIR

2790
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,000
VERY QUICK RESPONSE SAVED LIVES.

2791
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THEM.

2792
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
THEY PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE

2793
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

2794
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
THEN THERE ARE DAYS LIKE FRIDAY

2795
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,000
WHEN THEY PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE

2796
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
LINE AND THEY ACTUALLY SAVE

2797
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:58,000
LIVES AS THEY CLEARLY DID ON

2798
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
FRIDAY.

2799
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,000
AS A RESULT, CHILDREN WENT HOME

2800
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
AND CONTINUED THEIR PREPARATIONS

2801
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS OR

2802
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,000
HANUKKAH.

2803
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ADULTS

2804
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,000
IN THE SCHOOL, THE TEACHERS, THE

2805
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
ADMINISTRATORS, ALL OF THE

2806
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
ADULTS.

2807
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
THOSE WHO DIED TRYING TO SAVE

2808
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,000
THEIR STUDENTS ARE HEROES.

2809
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
THEY GAVE THEIR LIVES SO OTHERS

2810
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
COULD LIVE.
AND THERE ARE THOSE TEACHERS WHO

2811
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
SAVED MANY LIVES, THEY ARE HERO

2812
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,000
ALSO.

2813
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
THERE ARE A LOT OF HEROES IN

2814
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
CONNECTICUT TODAY AND I'M

2815
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
GRATEFUL TO ALL OF THEM.

2816
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I SAID IN MY REMARKS SATURDAY

2817
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
NIGHT THAT I THOUGHT THERE WOULD

2818
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
BE A TIME FOR PUBLIC DISCUSSION

2819
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,000
AND THAT DISCUSSION WOULD

2820
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
INEVITABLY OCCUR.
AS IT DOES EVERY TIME WHEN A

2821
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
TRAGEDY LIKE THIS TAKES PLACE.

2822
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
AND I THINK SOME PEOPLE

2823
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
INTERPRETED THAT TO MEAN THAT I

2824
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
THOUGHT IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE FOR

2825
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
THOSE DISCUSSIONS TO TAKE PLACE.

2826
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
I DO NOT THINK IT'S

2827
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
INAPPROPRIATE FOR THEM TO TAKE

2828
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
PLACE.
IN FACT, IT'S QUITE APPROPRIATE.

2829
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,000
THE POINT I WAS MAKING WAS THAT

2830
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,000
NO MORE THAN 36 HOURS AFTER THE

2831
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
EVENT, MY JOB, MY PERSONAL JOB

2832
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
AS GOVERNOR AT THAT MOMENT, WAS

2833
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,000
TO SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE OF

2834
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
CONNECTICUT ABOUT THE FEARS

2835
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
THEY'RE FEELING, THE DAMAGE

2836
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
THAT'S BEEN DONE, AND MY JOB WAS

2837
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
TO HELP AND CONTINUE TO HELP

2838
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
NEWTOWN AND THE ENTIRE STATE TO

2839
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
RECOVER.

2840
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
BUT WE KNOW IN OUR STATE WE HAVE

2841
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,000
SOME OF THE TOUGHEST LAWS IN THE

2842
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
NATION.

2843
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
I'M GOING TO ASK A FEW

2844
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:37,000
QUESTIONS.
IS THERE A LAW, A POLICY, WE

2845
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
COULD HAVE HAD ON THE BOOKS THAT

2846
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,000
MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED THIS

2847
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:45,000
STRATEGY?
IT TURNS OUT QUITE CLEARLY THE

2848
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
ANSWER IS YES, I BELIEVE IT IS

2849
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
YES, AND WE SHOULD PURSUE THAT

2850
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,000
STRATEGY.

2851
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
ARE WE DOING ENOUGH TO REACH OUT

2852
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
TO KIDS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE

2853
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
OBVIOUSLY IN TROUBLE?
MY SENSE IS WE ARE NOT AND WE

2854
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
NEED TO LOOK AT THAT WITHIN OUR

2855
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
OWN STATE AND WITHIN OUR OWN

2856
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
NATION.

2857
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
FINALLY, DO I THINK WASHINGTON,

2858
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
D.C. NEEDS TO GET ITS ACT

2859
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
TOGETHER AND ENACT STRICTER GUN

2860
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
CONTROL LAWS AT THE FEDERAL

2861
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
LEVEL?
YOU BET I DO.

2862
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
I'M CONFIDENT, ESPECIALLY AFTER

2863
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
HEARING THE PRESIDENT AND HIS

2864
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
ADDRESS TODAY THAT PERHAPS --

2865
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,000
AND THE COMMENTS OF OUR OWN

2866
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
DELEGATE ORGANIZATION THAT

2867
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
PERHAPS THE DEBATE WILL BE

2868
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
RENEWED IN WASHINGTON AND LEAD

2869
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
TO A DIFFERENT RESULT, ONE OTHER

2870
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:35,000
THAN THE RESULT THAT ALLOWED THE

2871
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:40,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN TO HAVE

2872
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
EXPIRED.

2873
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
THE DEBATE IS ALREADY PLAYING

2874
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:48,000
OUT ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL.

2875
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
IF CONNECTICUT OR I CAN BE A

2876
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
VOICE ON THAT LEVEL, WE ARE

2877
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:58,000
PREPARED TO ENTER THAT STATE

2878
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
RIGHT NOW.
OUR FOCUS NOW IS TO HELP GET

2879
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
THROUGH THIS TERRIBLE TIME.

2880
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,000
FIRST, OFFERS OF FINANCIAL

2881
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,000
ASSISTANCE, GENEROUS OFFER, ARE

2882
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
POURING IN.

2883
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I'VE ASKED MY STAFF TO HANDLE

2884
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,000
ALL OF THIS IN AN ORGANIZED

2885
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,000
FASHION.
I EXPECT TO HAVE SOMETHING

2886
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
FURTHER TO ANNOUNCE ABOUT THIS

2887
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.

2888
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
I KNOW THAT THE COMMUNITY OF NEW

2889
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
TOWN IS WORKING WITH UNITED WAY

2890
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
ON THIS VERY SUBJECT AS WELL AND

2891
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:32,000
HAS SET UP A FUND THERE.

2892
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
SECOND, I'VE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE

2893
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
ORDER THAT WILL PERMIT MONROE

2894
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
AND NEWTOWN TO ENTER INTO AN

2895
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:42,000
AGREEMENT CONCERNI INING THE US

2896
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
A MONROE EXTRA SCHOOL THEY HAVE,

2897
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
SURPLUS SCHOOL, THAT WILL ALLOW

2898
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
THAT SCHOOL TO BE USED

2899
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
IMMEDIATELY AND SUSPENDS SOME OF

2900
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,000
THE PUBLIC NOTICE ASPECTS OF

2901
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,000
ENTERING INTO THAT AGREEMENT.

2902
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

2903
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I WAS PREPARED TO DECLARE A

2904
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
SEPARATE EMERGENCY, BUT THE

2905
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,000
REALITY IS, WE'RE STILL UNDER

2906
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
HURRICANE SANDY EMERGENCY SO I

2907
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
USED THAT AS THE BASIS TO

2908
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:11,000
EXECUTE THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER.

2909
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,000
THIRD, I'M ASKING FRIDAY,

2910
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
DECEMBER 21st, AT 9:30 A.M.,

2911
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
EXACTLY ONE WEEK AFTER THE

2912
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,000
HORROR BEGAN TO UNFOLD IN

2913
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
NEWTOWN, THAT THE ENTIRE STATE

2914
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
OBSERVE A MOMENT OF SILENCE.

2915
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,000
I'D LIKE TO ASK HOUSES OF

2916
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
WORSHIP WITH THE ABILITY TO PLAY

2917
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
BELLS TO DO SO.

2918
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
26 BELLS FOR THE BEAUTIFUL

2919
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
CHILDREN AND 6 WONDERFUL ADULTS

2920
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
WHO WERE KILLED AT THE SCHOOL ON

2921
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,000
THAT DAY.

2922
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:45,000
I'LL BE SENDING A LETTER OF

2923
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
NOTIFICATION TO ALL OF THE OTHER

2924
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
GOVERNORS THROUGH THE NGA TO ASK

2925
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
THEM TO ASK THEIR CITIZENS TO

2926
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
OBSERVE THAT OCCASION AS WELL.

2927
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
NOW I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR

2928
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
QUESTIONS.

2929
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
>> GOVERNOR, WHILE THE FEDERAL

2930
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
ASSAULT BAN HAS EXPIRED, THE

2931
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
STATE BAN HERE IN CONNECTICUT

2932
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
REMAINS IN EFFECT.

2933
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,000
HAS BEEN SINCE 1993.

2934
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
SEEMS UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT

2935
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
THIS WEAPON THAT WAS SEIZED AT

2936
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
THIS INCIDENT WAS COVERED BY IT

2937
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,000
OR NOT.
WE ALSO HAVE A UNIQUE LAW ON THE

2938
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
BOOKS THAT WAS ENACTED A COUPLE

2939
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:16,000
OF YEARS AFTER THE LOTTERY

2940
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
SHOOTINGS, WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO

2941
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
REPORT SOMEONE WHO YOU THINK IS

2942
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
DANGEROUS AND HAS WEAPONS IN THE

2943
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,000
HOUSE.
I THINK IT'S CALLED THE WEAPONS

2944
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
SEIZURE LAW.
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT "REPORT YOUR

2945
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
NEIGHBOR" LAW, YOU KNOW THE ONE

2946
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

2947
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
THOSE ARE TWO OF THE TOUGHEST

2948
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
LAWS ON THE BOOKS IN THE

2949
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,000
COUNTRY, YET NEITHER ONE OF THEM

2950
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,000
HELPED HERE.

2951
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
A MAN SHOT HIS WAY INTO THE

2952
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
SCHOOL.

2953
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
IS THERE REALLY ANYTHING ELSE

2954
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
THAT COULD BE DONE --

2955
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
>> SURE --

2956
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
>> -- TO STOP THING LIKE --

2957
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
>> NUMBER ONE, WE DO USE THE

2958
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
LATTER OF THE TWO STATUTES

2959
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
YOU'VE REFERRED TO.

2960
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,000
I THINK WE'VE REMOVED THOUSANDS

2961
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
OF GUNS USING THAT STATUTE.

2962
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
SECONDLY WITH RESPECT TO THE

2963
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
EXPIRING -- WHAT WAS OTHERWISE

2964
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
THE BRADY BILL OR THE ASSAULT

2965
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
WEAPONS BAN, UNDER THAT

2966
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,000
LEGISLATION, CLIPS WERE LIMITED

2967
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
TO TEN.

2968
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
WE KNOW THAT IN THIS CASE CLIPS

2969
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:11,000
WERE USED WITH 30 CARTRIDGES AND

2970
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,000
MULTIPLES WERE USED.

2971
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,000
THAT ONE DIFFERENCE COULD VERY

2972
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,000
WELL HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT, AND

2973
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
I SUSPECT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN.

2974
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,000
YOU KNOW, THESE GUNS AREN'T USED

2975
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
TO HUNT DEER, AND, YOU KNOW, I'M

2976
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
A BIG BELIEVER IN HUNTING

2977
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
RIGHTS, BIG BELIEVER IN

2978
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,000
SUPPORTING THE SECOND AMENDMENT.

2979
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:41,000
BUT THERE IS A REALITY THAT THIS

2980
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
STUFF HAS GONE TOO FAR, AND IS

2981
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:47,000
TOO EASY TO OWN, AND THEN

2982
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:51,000
YOUR -- THE WHOLE POINT OF YOUR

2983
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,000
QUESTION IS THAT CONNECTICUT HAS
THESE LAWS.

2984
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
IN THE ABSENCE OF A FEDERAL

2985
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,000
FRAMEWORK IN WHICH WE LIMIT

2986
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
REALLY THE EXPLOSIVE NATURE OF

2987
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,000
THE WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION

2988
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
THAT'S USED, NO STATE WOULD EVER

2989
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:08,000
BE SAFE BASED ON SIMPLY ITS OWN

2990
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,000
LAWS.

2991
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:12,000
THAT'S WHY THE BRADY BILL, THE

2992
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN WAS SO

2993
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
IMPORTANT.
POLITICS PLAYED A ROLE INTO

2994
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:20,000
ALLOWING THAT TO EXPIRE.

2995
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,000
POLITIC SHOGS PLAY A ROLE IN

2996
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:26,000
HAVING IT BE REINSTITUTED.

2997
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,000
WE CAN'T BUILD A BUILDING ANY

2998
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:55,000
FASTER THAN THEY CAN BUILD A

2999
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,000
BUILDING.
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A LOCAL ISSUE

3000
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:01,000
TO BE DISCUSSED AND WE'LL

3001
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
RT
