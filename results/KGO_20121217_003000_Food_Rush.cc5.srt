GREENS ON AND THEN I'M GOING TO

465
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
WAIT UNTIL WE TURN THESE TO PUT

466
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
THE RUMS ON BECAUSE THEY DON'T

467
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
TAKE THAT LONG.

468
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
>> THEY TAKE JUST A SECOND.

469
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
>> AND I CUT THAT BECAUSE THEY

470
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
ARE PRETTY DENSE IN THE MIDDLE.

471
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
AND THESE ARE NICE BECAUSE THEY

472
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
ADD A LITTLE BIT OF BITTERNESS

473
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
WITH GOES WELL WITH THE PLUM

474
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
FLAVOR.
>> ONE OF THE GREENS THAT CAN

475
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
HOLD UP ON THE GRILL OR RAW.

476
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
SUPER UNIVERSAL.

477
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
>> IT AND THIS TIME OF YEAR

478
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
THEY ARE A LITTLE MILDER.

479
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
IN THE WINTER TIME THEY ARE A

480
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
LITTLE MORE BITTER.

481
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
THE YELLOW ONES TEND TO BE MORE

482
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
BITTER THAN THE RED ONES ARE.

483
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
AND RIDICIA IS REALLY GREAT.

484
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
>> PORTABELLAS CAN BE MARINATED

485
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
A LONG TIME AND BRAISED COOKED

486
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
ROAST.

488
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
VEGETARIAN STYLE.
>> THE OTHER THING ABOUT

489
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
MUSHROOMS IS THEY ARE GOOD FOR

490
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
YOU.

491
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
HIGH IN PROTEIN WITHOUT THE

492
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
FAT.
>> THERE IS A TRICK WHEN YOU

493
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
ARE COOKING WITH PROTEIN.

494
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO GET THE

495
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
HASH MARKS ON THEIR STEAKS.

496
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
SEEING LIKE THIS AND THEN TURN

497
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
IT TO SEAR ON THE OTHER SIDE.

498
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
IMAGINE ALL THE WATER IS GOING

499
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
UP IN THE GLASS AND IF YOU

500
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
DON'T TURN THE PROTEIN OVER AND

501
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
TRY TO SEER IT ON THE OTHER

502
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
SIDE ALL OF THE JUICES ARE

503
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
GOING UP TO THE TOP.

504
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
IMAGINE THIS IS A STEAK AND YOU

STILL DOING IT IT ON THAT SIDE.

508
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
BY THE TIME YOU FLIP IT OVER

509
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
YOU ARE ABOUT THREE QUARTERS

510
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
COOKED AND DRIED OUT ON ONE

511
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
GRILL IT, FLIP IT OVER AND

514
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
GRILL ON THE OTHER SIDE AND

515
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
