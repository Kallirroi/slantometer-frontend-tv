LET'S CHECK IN WITH OUR JUSTICE

DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT, PIERRE

172

THOMAS.

173

HE'S BEEN TALKING TO HIS SOURCE

174
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
THERE IS.
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?

175
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000

HAVE SENT PEOPLE TO THE SCENE.

178
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
IT'S AN ACTIVE SCENE.

179
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
ONE OFFICIAL SAID THE SHOOTER IS

180
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
DEAD.

181
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
THAT TWO FIRE ARMS HAVE BEEN

182
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000

AGAIN, A LARGE NUMBER OF FEDERAL

183
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000

185
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
THAT SUGGESTS THERE IS A LOT TO

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
INVESTIGATE.
THEY'RE BEING VERY CAREFUL

187
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000

188
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
ONE OFFICIAL SAID HE HAD BEEN

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
TOLD OF TWO CHILDREN INJURED IN

190
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
SOME FASHION.

191
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET ADDITIONAL

192
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
INFORMATION FROM THE LOCAL

193
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
AUTHORITIES BEFORE THEY GIVE OUT

194
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000

THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE SLURE TH

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
SCHOOL IS CLEAR.

196
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO GO

197
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
THROUGH.
THE MAIN THING IS TO MAKE SURE

198
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
PEOPLE GET SAFE.

199
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000

200
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
CHILDREN WITH ALL THE PARENTS

201
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
WAITING FOR THEM.

THE SHOOTING AT THE MALL IN

211
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
PORTLAND, OREGON.

212
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
BY OUR CALCULATION, AT LEAST 31

213
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS SINCE COLUMBINE

214
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000

215
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000

WE'LL HAVE A FULL KNOW HOW

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR PRESENTS

227
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
UNDER THE TREE?

228
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
WELL, WE HAD OUR PRESENTS SORT

229
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
OF LIKE STACKED UP AGAINST THE

230
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
WALL, BECA

231
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
WALL, BECAUSE OUR TREE WAS ON

232
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
LIKE THIS, WE JUST USED THE TREE

233
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
SKIRT TO COVER THE GIANT BIN

234
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
THAT THE TREE WAS IN.

235
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
THEN MY FATHER REPLANTS IT IN

236
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
THE FRONT YARD, BECAUSE ISN'T IT

237
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
LOVELY WE DIDN'T KILL A TREE, WE

238
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
SAVED A TREE?

239
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
WELL, LOW AND BEHOLD, MY FATHER

240
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
HAD TO EVENTUALLY MOVE THE TREE

241
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
THREE TIMES AND THEN CUT IT DOWN

242
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
BECAUSE IT WAS KILLING THE

243
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
PLUMBING IN OUR HOUSE.

244
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

245
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
KELLY: THE TREE DEVOURED OUR

246
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
HOUSE!
MICHAEL: BUT EVERY YEAR HE WOULD

247
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
DIG UP THAT SAME TREE EVERY

248
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
YEAR?
OR GO BUY NEW TREES?

249
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
HOW MANY TREES IN YOUR FRONT

250
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
YARD?

251
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
KELLY: NO, NO THAT WAS THE ONLY

252
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
TIME HE DID THA BOUGHT AN ATHEN

253
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
BECAUSE THIS IS BACK BREAKING

254
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
WORK, I CAN'T DO THAT.

255
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
BUT THE TREE HE PLANTED KEPT

256
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
GROWING AND GROWING.

257
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
AND HE KEPT HAVING TO MOVE IT

258
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
AND MOVE IT.

259
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
AND EVENTUALLY, IT WAS LIKE THE

260
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
TREE THAT ATE OUR LIVES.

261
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
AND THEN, HE INVESTED IN THE

262
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
AXE.

263
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
MICHAEL: OH.

264
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
KELLY: IT WAS LIKE A SCENE FROM

265
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
"MOMMY DEAREST."

266
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
KELLY!
BRING ME THE AXE!

267
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
MICHAEL: WE HAD A FAKE TREE LONG

268
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
BEFORE THEY WERE INVOGUE.

269
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
WE HAD REAL TREES.

270
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
MY PARENTS WERE LIKE I'M TIRED

271
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
OF CLEANING IT UP.

272
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
SO WE ENDED UP GETTING A FAKE

273
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
TREE.
THE PAINFUL THING ABOUT THE FAKE

274
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
TREES, OR ANY TREE, TRYING TO

275
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
CONNECT ALL THOSE LIGHTS, THEN

276
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
YOU GET THE ONES THAT DON'T

277
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
LIGHT UP AND YOU'RE FOLLOWING

278
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
THROUGH THE TREE.

279
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
THIS IS A PAIN.

280
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
KELLY: I REMEMBER MY AUNT AND

281
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000

292
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I WAS LIKE THIS IS WHAT HEAVEN

A "STAR WARS" BED.

310
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000

311
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
ROYALTY AND I WASN'T SURE HOW WE

312
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
WERE RELATED TO THEM!

313
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
MICHAEL: THEN I ALSO REMEMBER,

314
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
SINCE WE'RE BACK IN THAT ERA, I

315
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000

316
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
PAGEANT TALKING ABOUT THE

317
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS SAYING.

322

WIFE, MY GRANDMOTHER WOULDN'T

605
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
LET HIM BACK IN BECAUSE IT HAS

606
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
TO BE A STRANGER, OR AT LEAST

607
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
SOMEBODY YOU DON'T KNOW.

608
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000

KELLY: THAT IS INCREDIBLE.

614
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I KIND OF LIKE THAT TRADITION.

615
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
IT'S SPOOKY AND UNPREDICTABLE!

ONLY NIGHT OF THE YEAR WE WERE

619
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
ALLOWED TO STAY UP REALLY LATE.

620
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000

BIKELES AS SORT OF A PASTTIME

640
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
BECAUSE I MADE A FILM CALLED

MOTORCYCLES BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE

657
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000

658
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
