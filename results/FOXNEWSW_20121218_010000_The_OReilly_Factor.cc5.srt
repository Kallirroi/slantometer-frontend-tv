FUTURE HE COMPLETED IT IN SIX

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
WEEKS AND STILL ONE OF THE MOST

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
POPULAR HOLIDAY STORIES OF ALL

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
TIME.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
IT WAS FOUNDED 169 YEARS AGO

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
TODAY.
THAT'S THE FOX REPORT FOR

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
MONDAY, DECEMBER 17, 2012.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'M JOHN SCOTT IN FOR SHEPARD

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
SMITH.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
SHEP IS BACK TOMORROW.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
"THE FACTOR" IS UP NEXT.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
>>> "THE O'REILLY FACTOR" IS ON.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
TONIGHT --
>> ARE WE REALLY PREPARED TO SAY

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
THAT WE'RE POWERLESS IN THE FACE

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
OF SUCH CARNAGE?

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
THAT THE POLITICS ARE TOO HARD?

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA HIPTING HE

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
WILL SUPPORT SOME KIND OF

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
MEASURE TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
IN AMERICA.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
SO WHAT THAT MIGHT BE IS A

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
MYSTERY.
WE'LL TELL WHAT YOU HAS WORKED

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
IN SOME OTHER COUNTRIES.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
>> SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
THAT COULD JUST LIGHT UP A ROOM.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON AND

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER DAD.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
>> AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE 13

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE MURDERED

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
HERE THAN IN OTHER DEVELOPED

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
NATIONS.
WHY?

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
WE WILL TRY TO ANSWER THAT

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
QUESTION.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
>> HIDING BEHIND THE SECOND

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
AMENDMENT DOESN'T CUT IT

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
ANYMORE.
IT'S TIME OUR LAWMAKERS REALIZE

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
THAT SOCIETY HAS CHANGED.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
>> IT TOOK JUST MINUTES FOR SOME

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
FAR LEFT PUNDITS TO EXPLOIT THE

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
TERRIBLE MURDERS IN CONNECTICUT

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES.

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
BERNIE GOLDBERG WILL HAVE

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
THOUGHTS ON THAT.

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
CAUTION.

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER THE NO

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
SPIN ZONE.

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
"THE FACTOR" BEGINS RIGHT NOW.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
>> HI.
I'M BILL O'REILLY.

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
THANKS FOR WATCHING US TONIGHT.

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
WHAT DO WE DO, WHAT DO WE DO

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
ABOUT VIOLENT EVIL?

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
EVENING'S TALKING POINTS MEMO.

62
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
HAVING DONE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
ON LEE HARVEY OSWALD FOR

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
"KILLING KENNEDY," I SNOW

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
SOMETHING ABOUT VIOLENT EVIL I.

66
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
SAW IT FIRSTHAND IN EL SALVADOR

67
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
AND THE MIDDLE EAST AND I SAT

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
ACROSS ELECTRIC IT WHEN I

69
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
INTERVIEWED A FORMER SS GUARD

70
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
WHO WORKED AT THE CONCENTRATION

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
CAMP IN GERMANY.

72
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
SO WHEN I FIRST HEARD THAT

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA HAD

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
MURDERED 27 PEOPLE, INCLUDING 20

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
LITTLE CHILDREN, I PRETTY MUCH

76
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
KNEW A FEW THINGS ABOUT LANZA.

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
NUMBER ONE, THAT HE WAS DEEPLY

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
ANGRY.
NUMBER TWO, THAT HE WAS

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
ALIENATED FROM MOST OTHER HUMAN

80
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
BEINGS.

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
NUMBER THREE, THAT MOST LIKELY

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
HE WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH THE

83
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
INTERNET.

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE NOW

85
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
BEEN ESTABLISHED.

86
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
ADAM LANZA COULD NOT LIVE HIS

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
LIFE IN A NORMAL WAY.

88
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
THERE HAS BEEN SPECULATION THAT

89
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
HE HAD ASPERGERS SYNDROME, BUT

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
THAT HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED

91
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
AND THAT IS UNFAIR TO KNOWS WHO

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
HAVE THAT PERSONALITY DISORDER,

93
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
OR AUTISM, TO DIAGNOSE HIM

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
WITHOUT CONCLUSIVE PROOF.

95
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I GIVE MONEY TO AUTISM CHARITY.

96
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE THAT

97
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
CONDITION ARE VIOLENT.

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH.

99
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THEY DON'T NEED TO BE

100
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
STIGMATIZED.
LET'S GET BACK TO LANZA.

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT PEOPLE

102
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
LIKE HIM?

103
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
THE ANSWER IS VERY LITTLE.

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
WE'RE A REACTIVE SOCIETY IN

105
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
AMERICA.
OUR FREEDOMS DICTATE THAT WE CAN

106
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
NOT WAREHOUSE PEOPLE OR STRANGE.

107
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THEY MUST COMMIT A CRIME OR DO

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
SOMETHING DESTRUCTIVE BEFORE
THEY CAN BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.

109
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
APPARENTLY ADAM LANZA DID NOT DO

110
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
THOSE THINGS UNTIL THE DAY HE

111
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
COMMITTED MASS MURDER.

112
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
SO ATTENTION TURNS TO THE GUNS

113
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
LANZA TOOK FROM HIS MOTHER WHOM

114
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
HE KILLED BEFORE THE SCHOOL

115
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
RAMPAGE.
THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
AMERICA DOES HAVE A GUN CULTURE.

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NEARLY

118
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
300 MILLION GUNS IN CIRCULATION

119
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
IN THIS COUNTRY.

120
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
CHILDREN AGES FIVE TO 14 ARE 13

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE MURDERED

122
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
WITH GUNS HERE AS CHILDREN IN

123
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS.

124
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
LAST YEAR MORE THAN 18,000

125
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
PEOPLE COMMITTED SUICIDE WITH A

126
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
FIREARM IN THIS COUNTRY.

127
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
MORE THAN 8,000 WERE MURDERED

128
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
WITH GUNS.

129
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
SIMPLY PASSING LAWS AGAINST GUN

130
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
POSSESSION WILL NOT STOP MASS

131
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
MURDER.
IT WOULD BE LIKE ENGLAND BANNING

132
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
KNIVES AFTER JACK THE RIPPER'S

133
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
KILLING SPREE.

134
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
U.S. CONSTITUTION ALLOWS

135
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
AMERICANS THE RIGHT TO ARM

136
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
THEMSELVES, NO QUESTION ABOUT

137
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
THAT.
BUT WE CAN NOW EXPECT PRESIDENT

138
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
OBAMA TO GET BEHIND LEGISLATION

139
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
THAT WOULD LIMIT WHAT KIND OF

140
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
FIREARMS THE PUBLIC CAN BUY.

141
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
>> ARE WE REALLY PREPARED TO SAY

142
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THAT WE'RE POWERLESS IN THE FACE

143
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
OF SUCH CARNAGE, THAT THE

144
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
POLITICS ARE TOO HARD?

145
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
ARE WE PREPARED TO SAY THAT SUCH

146
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
VIOLENCE VISITED ON OUR CHILDREN

147
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR IS

148
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
SOMEHOW THE PRICE OF OUR

149
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
FREEDOM?
>> THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING LAST

150
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
NIGHT IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
HE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY SAY HE

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
WOULD CALL FOR STRICTER CONTROLS

153
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
ON HEAVY WEAPONS LIKE THE AR 15

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
RIFLE LANZA USED.

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
BUT IT'S CLEAR HE IS HEADING IN

156
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
THAT DIRECTION.

157
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
BUT BEFORE CONGRESS TAKES ANY

158
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
ACTION, IT SHOULD STUDY THE

159
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
SITUATIONS IN EASTERN EUROPE AND

160
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
RUSSIA WHERE MOST GUNS ARE

161
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
BANNED.
HASN'T CUT DOWN ON GUN VIOLENCE,

162
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
HOWEVER.
AS THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE A HIGHER

163
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
MURDER RATE THAN THE USA.

164
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
ALSO THE GUN MURDER RATE HERE IN

165
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
AMERICA HAS ALMOST BEEN CUT IN

166
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
HALF IN THE PAST 20 YEARS.

167
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
TALKING POINTS WANTS A SANE

168
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
COUNTRY WITH SMART PUBLIC SAFETY

169
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
MEASURES.
DO WE NEED SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES

170
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
TO BE EASILY AVAILABLE?

171
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
THAT'S A WORTHY DEBATE.

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
AND THERE ARE STRONG POINTS ON

173
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
EACH SIDE.

174
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
CLEARLY WE THE PEOPLE, HAVE TO

175
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
TAKE A TOUGH LOOK AT OUR VIOLENT

176
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
SOCIETY AND FIND SOME EFFECTIVE

177
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
SOLUTIONS WITHOUT VIOLATING

178
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.

179
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION, BUT

180
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
WE HAVE TO TRY.

181
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
THAT'S A MEMO.

182
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
NOW FOR THE TOP STORY, REACTION.

183
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
JOININGS FROM PHOENIX, ALAN

184
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
GOTTLIEB, FOUNDER OF THE SECOND

185
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
AMENDMENT FOUNDATION, NATIONAL

186
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
RIFLE ASSOCIATION, WOULD NOT

187
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
PROVIDE, WOULD NOT PROVIDE A

188
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
SPOKESPERSON THIS EVENING.

189
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY GIVE AT ALL?

190
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
IS THERE ANY AREA THAT YOU WOULD

191
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
COMPROMISE AS FAR AS NEW LAWS

192
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

193
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
OBTAIN CERTAIN WEAPONS?

194
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
>> FIRST, BILL, LET ME SAY I

195
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
THOUGHT YOUR TALK POINTS WERE

196
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
REALLY EXCELLENT.

197
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AFFIDAVIT

198
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
THE DATA HERE, WE BANNED ASSAULT

199
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
RIFLES ONE TIME IN 1994.

200
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL

201
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE'S STUDY ON

202
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
THAT BAN THAT WAS DONE IN 1999,

203
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
AS WELL AS THE UNIVERSITY STUDY

204
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

205
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
BERKELEY, HARDLY A BASSTIVE

206
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
PRO-GUN RIGHTS THOUGHT, IT

207
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
SHOWED IT HAD NO IMPACT AT ALL

208
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
ON LOWERING HOMICIDE RATES.

209
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
IN FACT, IT HAD NO IMPACT AT ALL

210
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
ON LOWERING MASS MURDERS.

211
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
IN FACT, IT HAD NO IMPACT AT ALL

212
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
IN THE NUMBER OF BULLETS THAT A

213
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
VICTIM WAS SHOT WITH.
SO THE TRUTH IS WE ALREADY KNOW

214
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
IT DOESN'T WORK.

215
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
BUT WHEN WE TRIED IT LAST TIME,

216
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
WHAT HAPPENED?

217
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
WE HAD A TEN-YEAR SUPPLY OF ALT

218
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
WEAPONS SOLD IN ONE YEAR BEFORE

219
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
THE BAN COULD GO INTO EFFECT AND

220
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
WHEN IT WAS ENACTED AND BECAME

221
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
EFFECTIVE.

222
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
BOTTOM LINE IS WE'RE GOING TO
SEE THAT AGAIN THIS TIME, TOO.

223
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
AS EVERYBODY CALLS FOR BANNING

224
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THESE GUN, YOU'LL SEE RECORD

225
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
SALES OF THESE FIREARMS.

226
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S WHAT THE

227
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
ANTIGUN PEOPLE WANT TO DO.

228
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
>> I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU AS

229
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
FAR AS THE STUDY AND THE DATA

230
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
AND ALL OF THAT.

231
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
BUT WHY DOES AN INDIVIDUAL NEED

232
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
AN AK 15?

233
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
MAYBE NEEDS NOT THE BEST WORD.

234
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
WOULD IT BE BETTER,

235
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
MR. GOTTLIEB, FOR AMERICANS TO

236
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
SAY YOU KNOW WHAT?

237
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'D LIKE TO HAVE TARGET PRACTICE

238
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
WITH THIS AND I'D LIKE TO GO

239
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
HUNTING WITH THAT.

240
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
AND IT'S A WEAPON THAT I'D LIKE

241
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
TO HAVE.
BUT FOR THE GREATER GOOD, I'M

242
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
GOING TO GO ALONG -- THIS IS

243
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
WHAT'S COMING DOWN AND YOU KNOW

244
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
IT'S COMING DOWN.

245
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'M GOING TO GO ALONG WITH THAT.

246
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
HAND GUNS I SAY NORTH TEXAS

247
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I MEAN, WE NEED -- WE THE PEOPLE

248
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
DOINGNEED THE ABILITY TO PROTECT

249
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
OURSELVES.

250
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
AN AK 15, I'M NOT SURE WE NEED

251
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
THAT.

252
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
>> WELL, IT'S AN AK 47 AND AR

253
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
15, IT'S EASY TO CONFUSE.

254
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
>> I'M SORRY.
>> I WANT TO GET YOU RIGHT ON

255
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
THAT.

256
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
WE SAW -- I LIKE TO POINT OUT ON

257
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
NATIONAL TELEVISION, WE SAW FILM

258
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
FOOTAGE OF KOREAN MERCHANTS

259
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
USING THESE TYPES OF FIREARMS ON

260
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
TOP OF THEIR ROOF TOPS DURING

261
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
THE L.A. RIOTS SO PLAYER PLACE

262
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
OF BUSINESSES WEREN'T LOOTED.

263
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
WE WATCHED DURING HURRICANE

264
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
ANDREW PEOPLE USING THESE KIND

265
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
OF FIREARMS IN FRONT OF THEIR

266
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
HOMES TO STOP LOOTING AFTER THE

267
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
HURRICANE OF THE LITTLE PROPERTY

268
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
THEY HAD LEFT.

269
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
THEY'RE USING SPORT SHOOTING

270
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
HEAVILY.

271
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
THESE SPORT UTILITIES --

272
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
>> SO YOU SAY IN SOME CASES

273
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
THEY'RE NEEDED TO DEFEND -- ALL

274
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
RIGHT.

275
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THAT'S YOUR ARGUMENT.
NOW, IN AUSTRALIA --

276
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
>> WELL, GO AHEAD.

277
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
>> IN AUSTRALIA, THEY DID BAN

278
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND THE

279
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
CRIME RATE PLUMMETED THERE.

280
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
AND THEY SAY IN AUSTRALIA, THAT

281
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
WAS A VERY EFFECTIVE PUBLIC

282
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
POLICY DEAL.

283
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
THAT HAPPENED IN 1996.

284
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
THEY DID A STUDY AND SAID LOOK,

285
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
HAND GUNS, OKAY.

286
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
A LITTLE STRICTER THAN HERE, NOT

287
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
SO MUCH.

288
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
CANADA, 60 DAYS TO OBTAIN A

289
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
FIREARM THERE.

290
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
THEY PUT YOU THROUGH HOOPS.

291
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
YOU GOT TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS

292
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

293
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
WOULD EITHER AUSTRALIA OR

294
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
CANADA, THE DATA THERE, 'CAUSE

295
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
MUCH LOWER GUN HOMICIDE RATE IN

296
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
BOTH OF THOSE COUNTRIES -- WOULD

297
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
THAT CONVINCE YOU AT ALL?

298
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
>> WELL, NO, BECAUSE IN

299
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
AUSTRALIA, WHILE IT WENT DOWN

300
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE BAN, WHAT

301
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
HAPPENED SUBSEQUENTLY IS IT WENT

302
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
BACK UP AGAIN.

303
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
>> NOT ACCORDING TO THE ANDREW

304
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
LEE OF THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY

305
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
THERE, WHO STUDIED TEN YEARS

306
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
HOMICIDES FELL 59% AND SUICIDES

307
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
65%.
SO THAT'S THE LATEST STUDY OUT

308
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
OF THERE.

309
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
>> WELL, MORE RECENT DATA SHOWS

310
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
THAT, IN FACT, IT'S COMING WAY

311
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
BACK UP AGAIN.

312
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
PEOPLE ARE ALSO USING OTHER

313
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
WEAPONS TO COMMIT CRIMES IF

314
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
AUSTRALIA AS WELL.

315
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
>> YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO

316
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THAT -- IN AUSTRALIA, HERE IT'S

317
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
3.3%.
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO WITH THE

318
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
STATS, IT'S WAY BELOW US IN

319
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
AUSTRALIA.

320
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
THAT'S JUST A FACT.

321
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
>> THAT IS A FACT.

322
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
BUT THE UNITED STATES IS A WHOLE

323
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
LOT OF REASONS WHY WE HAVE THE

324
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
VIOLENT CRIME, NOT JUST WITH

325
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
GUNS, BUT OTHER WEAPONS AS WELL.

326
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
A LOT OF CULTURAL, ECONOMIC,

327
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
SOCIAL REASONS WHY.

328
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
>> I SEE THAT.

329
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
AND AUSTRALIA HAS ONLY

330
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
22 MILLION.
WE HAVE 320 PEOPLE.

331
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
CANADA, AGAIN, THEY HAVE

332
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
35 MILLION PEOPLE.

333
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
BUT WOULDN'T IT MAKE A LITTLE

334
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
BIT MORE SENSE JUST TO TIGHTEN

335
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
THINGS UP A LITTLE BIT?

336
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I AM A SECOND AMENDMENT GUY.

337
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
AND I KNOW WHAT THE FOUNDING

338
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
FATHERS' INTENT WAS.

339
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
THEY WANTED AMERICANS TO BE ABLE

340
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.

341
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THERE ISN'T ANY QUESTION ABOUT

342
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
IT.
BUT I THINK WE CAN TIGHTEN IT UP

343
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
A LITTLE, MR. GOTTLIEB.

344
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'LL GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD.

345
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
>> BILL, LIKE YOU SAID IN YOUR

346
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
TALKING POINTS, NEW GUN LAWS

347
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
WOULDN'T PROBABLY STOP A CRIME

348
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
LIKE THIS AND YOU'RE RIGHT, THEY

349
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
WON'T.

350
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
HE BROKE AT LEAST 41 LAWS TO

351
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
BEGIN WITH.

352
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
PROBLEM HERE IS MENTAL HEALTH

353
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES NEED

354
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
TO BE UPDATED AND CHANGED SO

355
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
THESE PEOPLE GET THE TREATMENT

356
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
THEY NEED AND THEY'RE NOT WALK

357
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
AROUND --

358
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
>> DID HE NOT DO ANYTHING IN 20

359
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
YEARS THAT WOULD HAVE WARRANTED

360
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
ANY KIND OF COMPULSORY MENTAL

361
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
HEALTH INTERVENTION ON HIS PART.

362
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
SO AGAIN, IT'S THE SAME THING.

363
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
>> WE'RE NOT SURE ABOUT THAT.

364
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
>> OUR RESEARCH SHOWS IT RIGHT

365
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
NOW.
NEW STUFF COULD COME IN, BUT

366
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
RIGHT NOW THERE WASN'T ANYTHING

367
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
THIS MAN DID IN 20 YEARS THAT

368
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
WOULD HAVE WARRANTED --

369
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000

>> I THINK IT COULD.

THE SECOND THING IS BACKGROUND

PROBABLY PASS THAT LAW.

521

SO I'M NOT SURE HOW NATIONALLY

530
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
ENFORCED ONE WOULD CHANGE THE

531
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000

533
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
SO I'M JUST CONCERNED, I THINK

534
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000

IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE

539
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
HIGHLY.
>> Bill: THAT'S RIGHT.

540
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT.

541
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
WE HAVE A STRUCTURE HERE.

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
WE HAVE A CONSTITUTION HERE

543
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
HISTORICALLY.
BUT THAT DOESN'T SOLVE THE

547
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
IMMEDIATE PROBLEM.
THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM IS

548
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
BASICALLY THAT YOU, ANY

549
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
AMERICAN, CAN GET A

550
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE OR PISTOL

551
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
AND ALL THE ROUNDS YOU WANT AND

552
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
YOU CAN GET IT IN CONNECTICUT --

553
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
LOOK, CHICAGO IS THE TOUGHEST

554
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
GUN LAWS AND THEY'RE GUNNING

555
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
PEOPLE DOWN LIKE FIVE OR SIX A

556
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
DAY.
>> THE EVIDENCE IS THAT DOESN'T

557
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
WORK.
I WOULD ADD ALSO THERE WAS

558
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
LEGISLATION PASSED IN THE WAKE

559
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
OF THE VIRGINIA TECH MASSACRE

560
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
WHICH ALLOWED STATES AND THE

561
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SHARE THAT

562
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
MENTAL HEALTH INFORMATION.

563
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I DO BELIEVE IT CAN BE A CIVIL

564
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
LINTS ISSUE OR CAN BE A

565
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
BUREAUCRATIC MESS.

566
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
BUT THAT WAS ALREADY PASSED.

567
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
>> Bill: IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S ADVISOR, WOULD YOU

568
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
ADVISE HIM TO DO ANYTHING, PUT

569
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
FORTH ANY NEW LEGISLATION?

570
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
>> I THINK SOME DISCUSSION OF,

571
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
LIKE, THE TWEAKING OF THE

572
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
INTERSECTION OF MENTAL HEALTH

573
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
AND OWNING GUNS COULD BE

574
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
HELPFUL, LIKE I SAID IN THE WAKE

575
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
OF THIS PAST ONE, SOMETHING

576
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
PASSED AND IT WAS SUPPORTED BY

577
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
THE BRADY CAMPAIGN AND THE NRA.

578
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
SO YOU CAN COME TOGETHER ON

579
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
THESE THINGS.

580
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY

581
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
CAREFUL.
THERE IS NOT A LOT OF EVIDENCE

582
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
THAT THESE LAWS STOP THESE

583
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
THINGS.

584
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
THESE ARE CRAZY PEOPLE INTENT ON

585
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
DOING THEM.

586
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
>> YOU KNOW, THIS IS JUST NOT

587
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
TRUE.
>> YOU'RE TAKING AWAY OTHER

588
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
PEOPLE'S ABILITIES TO DEFEND

589
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
THEMSELVES.

590
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
>> MARY KATHERINE, IF YOU'RE

591
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
SELLING GUNS IN THE WOODS OF

592
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
VERGE, BELIEVE ME, THERE BECOMES

593
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
A PIPELINE TO THE CITIES  THAT

594
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
LEADS TO THIS KIND OF CARNAGE

595
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
AND I THINK WE AS A COUNTRY HAVE

596
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
TO HAVE AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN

597
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
AND STOP SELLING THESE LARGE --

598
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
>> Bill: I GOT TO GO.

599
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION.

600
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
>> BE HONEST ABOUT THE FACT

601
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

602
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
IN AUSTRALIA, THEY TOOK GUNS

603
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
AWAY FROM PEOPLE --

604
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
>> Bill: HOLD IT!
HOLD IT!

605
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
>> YOU OVERREACT.
>> Bill: HOLD IT.

606
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A

607
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
UNIFORM THING OF ALL 50 STATES

608
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
ABOUT WHO YOU SELL TO AND

609
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
INFORMATION ABOUT GUNS.

610
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
BUT JUAN, THE THING ABOUT THE

611
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC BA 300 MILLION

612
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000

613
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
AS MR. GOTTLIEB POINTED OUT,

614
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
THEY'RE GOING TO BUY THEM AND

615
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
THEY'RE AROUND AND THE BAD GUYS

616
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
ARE GOING TO HAVE THEM AND THE

617
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
GOOD GUYS AREN'T.

618
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
>> YOU JUST CAN'T CURSE THE

619
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
NIGHT.
YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING, BILL.

620
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
>> NOT IF IT DOESN'T WORK AND IF

621
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
YOU'RE IMPEDING OTHER PEOPLE.

622
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
>> Bill: RIGHT.

623
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
YOU DON'T MAKE IT WORSE.

624
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
VERY INTERESTING DEBATE, YOU

625
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
GUYS.
DIRECTLY AHEAD, WE'LL TAKE TO

626
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000

WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

675
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
TO YOU THAT YOU SAW TODAY?

676
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
>> WOW.

677
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I GUESS WHAT I'M LEARNING ABOUT

678
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
THE KILLER.

679
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I GUESS WHAT I'M LEARNING ABOUT

680
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE

681
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
KILLER'S MOTHER.

682
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
LET'S TAKE THE FIRST THING.

683
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
WHAT I AM TOLD IS THAT ADAM

684
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
LANZA WAS WELL-KNOWN IN THIS

685
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
TOWN OF SANDY HOOK.

686
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
HE WAS ALWAYS THE KIND OF PERSON

687
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
WHO JUST DID NOT FIT IN.

688
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO TOLD ME

689
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
THAT HE WOULD STOP ON A SIDEWALK

690
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
AND STARE AT YOU AND STARE AT

691
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
YOU AND STARE AT YOU MORE UNTIL

692
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
YOU WENT AND PASSED BY.

693
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
SOCIAL SETTINGS, HE RARELY, IF

694
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
EVER, TALKED.

695
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU'RE A

696
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
TEEN-AGER GROWING UP HERE

697
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
ENCOUNTERING THIS YOUNG MAN, HOW

698
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
DO YOU REACT AND RESPOND TO HIM?

699
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
PART OF THAT, I THINK, HELPED TO

700
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
PUSH HIM FURTHER INTO ISOLATION.

701
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
THIS POINT IS KEY, BILL.

702
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
HE HAD NO CRIMINAL RECORD.

703
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
NONE.

704
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
EVER THAT THE POLICE TOLD US

705
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
TODAY.
>> Bill: RIGHT.

706
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
THAT'S A SMALL TOWN.

707
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
IF HE WERE CAUSING TROUBLE ON

708
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
ANY LEVEL, BUT YOU CAN'T ARREST

709
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
SOMEONE FOR STARING AT YOU.

710
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
HE WAS A WEIRDO.

711
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
THERES NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

712
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
AND NOW WE FIND OUT HE WAS

713
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH THE NET,

714
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
WHICH IS ALWAYS A PROVOCATIVE

715
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
SITUATION.

716
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
WHAT IT YOU LEARN ABOUT THE

717
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
MOTHER?
>> THE MOTHER, REMEMBER ON

718
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
FRIDAY WHEN THERE WERE ALL THESE

719
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
REPORTS SHE WAS A TEACHER AT THE

720
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
SCHOOL AND THAT --

721
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
>> Bill: THEY WEREN'T TRUE.

722
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
>> SHE NEVER TAUGHT HERE.

723
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
NOW THEY'RE SAYING HE HAD NO

724
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL.

725
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
HOWEVER, AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE

726
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
STRONGLY CONNECTED TO THE POLICE

727
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
DEPARTMENT HERE IN NEWTOWN TELL

728
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
ME THAT SHE VOLUNTEERED AT THE

729
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
SCHOOL.

730
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
NOW, DID SHE TEACH THESE KIDS IN

731
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
THAT FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM?

732
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
THAT'S NOT CONFIRMED.

733
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
HOW OFTEN DID SHE DO IT?

734
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
WHAT CLASS DID SHE TEACH?

735
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
WE CANNOT SAY.

736
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
BUT SHE APPARENTLY DID HAVE A

737
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
CONNECTION AND THAT WAS THROUGH

738
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
THE VOLUNTEER WORK SHE DID.

739
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I MENTIONED THAT, BILL, 'CAUSE

740
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
THAT COULD BE A CRITICAL POINT

741
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
OF EVIDENCE IN TRYING TO TIE THE

742
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
SHOOTER TO THE SCHOOL BEHIND ME

743
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
HERE.
>> Bill: THE FUNERALS HAVE

744
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
BEGUN, WHICH JUST MAKES

745
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
EVERYTHING -- COMPOUNDS THE

746
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
GRIEF.

747
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM

748
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
WATCHING FOX NEWS ALL DAY TODAY,

749
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
THE TOWN IS HANDLING IT AS WELL

750
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
AS ANYBODY COULD HANDLE IT,

751
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
RIGHT?
THERE ISN'T ANY KIND OF LASHING

752
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
OUT OR ACTING OUT.

753
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
THERE IS NONE OF THAT.

754
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
THEY'RE VERY DIGNIFIED PEOPLE.

755
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
>> YEAH.
SO FAR I AGREE WITH YOU

756
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
ENTIRELY.

757
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
YOU KNOW THE STAGES.

758
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
SHOCK AND THEN GRIEF.

759
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
THEY'RE IN GRIEF NOW.

760
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
THEN IT'S ANGER.

761
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I DON'T THINK WE'VE REALLY SEEN

762
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
THE THIRD PHASE OF THAT.

763
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
BUT WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT SOME

764
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS WHO

765
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 9:30 IN THE

766
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
MORNING, ONE WAS A U.S. MARINE

767
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
WHO SERVED TWO TOURS OF DUTY IN

768
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
AFGHANISTAN.
HE'S IN HIS MID 20S.

769
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
HE'S NOT TALKING YET AND PERHAPS

770
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
WILL NOT FOR SOME TIME.

771
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
HE IS TELLING HIS CLOSE FRIENDS,

772
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
BILL, THAT WHAT HE FOUND INSIDE

773
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
THAT CLASSROOM, FAR EXCEEDS

774
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
ANYTHING HE SAW IN WAR IN

775
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
AFGHANISTAN, THE MOUNTAINS OF

776
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
THE DESERTS OF THAT COUNTRY,

777
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
OVER TWO DIFFERENT TOURS OF

778
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
DUTY.
YOU IMAGINE THE HELP THAT MAN IS

779
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
GOING TO NEED FOR THE REST OF

780
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
HIS LIFE BASED ON WHAT HE SAW

781
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
INSIDE.
THE OTHER THING I WANT TO PASS

782
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
ON TO YOU AND YOUR VIEWERS,

783
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
BILL, LATE ON SATURDAY NIGHT, I

784
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
WAS IN ONE OF THE RESTAURANTS

785
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
HERE AFTER A LONG DAY OF WORK.

786
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
THE WOMAN SITTING NEXT TO ME,

787
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY INCONSOLABLE,

788
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
BILL.

789
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I MEAN, THE TEARS RUNNING DOWN

790
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
HER FACE AND LOOKING AT US AND

791
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
TELLING, YOU'RE CRYING JUST AS

792
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
MUCH AS I AM.
YOU'RE HURTING JUST AS MUCH AS I

793
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
AM.

794
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
AND I PUT MY ARM AROUND HER AND

795
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I SAID, LOOK, AMERICA IS CRYING

796
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
WITH YOU.
BUT THEN THE MAN NOKES TO HER,

797
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
HE WAS JUST STARING OFF IN THAT

798
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
100-YARD STARE WITH TEARS

799
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
ROLLING DOWN HIS FACE AND THE

800
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
WOMAN NEXT TO HIM DOING THE SAME

801
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
THING.

802
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
THEN WE'D WALK OUT.
ANOTHER GROUP CAME IN AND THEY

803
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
WERE DOING THE SAME THING.

804
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
THIS IS A TOWN IN ABSOLUTE

805
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
MOURNING.
IT IS A TOWN YET AGAIN THAT YOU

806
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
FIND IN TEARS.

807
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
TWO MORE FUNERALS TOMORROW,

808
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000

THE LIVING CONDITIONS IN THERE

THAT'S HOW IT WAS.

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000

900
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
WERE THERE GUARDS, A WARDEN?

901
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000

THE GUARDS THERE WERE MOST OF

908
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
THEM WERE PRETTY CORRUPT.

909
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
THEY WOULD BRING YOU ANYTHING

910
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
THAT YOU BASICALLY WANTED INTO

911
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
THE PRISON.

912
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
IF YOU WANTED MONEY BROUGHT IN

913
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
OR FOR SOME PEOPLE DRUGS AND

914
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
STUFF LIKE THAT.

915
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED WAS AT
6:00 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING,

916
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
THEY WOULD OPEN UP THE CELLS.

917
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
EVERYONE WENT O A BIG FREE FOR

918
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
ALL ALL DAY LONG, RUNNING AROUND

919
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
THE PRISON.

920
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
YOU KNOW, LIKE I SAID, THERE WAS

921
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
11, 1200 PEOPLE IN THERE AT A

922
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
TIME.
SO THE STATISTICS IN THERE WERE

923
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
800 PEOPLE OUT OF THE 11 OR 1200

924
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
WERE ALL DRUG ADDICTS.

925
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
>> Bill: THE GUARD WOULD SELL

926
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
THE PRISONERS DRUGS, NARCOTICS.

927
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Bill: HOW ABOUT THE VIOLENCE

928
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
LEVEL?
>> WELL, ON A DAILY BASIS, THERE

929
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
WERE FIGHTS.

930
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I SAW A COUPLE MURDERS.

931
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
A COUPLE GUYS STABBED TO DEATH.

932
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I, UNFORTUNATELY, WAS IN A

933
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
COUPLE OF FIGHTS AND WAS STABBED

934
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
TWO DIFFERENT TIMES THERE IN THE

935
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
PRISON, JUST BASICALLY OVER

936
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
MONEY.

937
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
>> Bill: DID YOU THINK YOU WERE
GOG DIE IN THERE?

938
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
>> OH, YES.

939
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I HONESTLY THOUGHT TO MYSELF AND

940
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I PRAYED -- I COULDN'T TELL YOU

941
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
HOW MANY PRAYERS I SAID WHILE I

942
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
WAS THERE INN THERE, LORD, JUST

943
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
GET ME OUT OF HERE.

944
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
IT WASN'T AN EVERYDAY PRAYER.

945
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
IT WAS AN ALL-DAY LONG PRAYER.

946
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
GOD, PLEASE JUST GET ME OUT OF

947
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
HERE ALIVE.

948
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
>> Bill: HOW DID THEY GET YOU

949
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
OUT?
HOW DID YOU FINALLY GET OUT?

950
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
>> WELL, AFTER THREE DIFFERENT

951
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
LAWYERS AND PAIN, THESE THREE

952
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
DIFFERENT LAWYERS, 70 TO $80,000

953
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
IN AMERICAN MONEY, NONE OF

954
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
THESE -- ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY

955
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
GOT ONE OF THE CHARGES DROPPED.

956
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
BUT I'M STILL CHARGED WITH

957
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED

958
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
SUBSTANCE.

959
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
AND AFTER 70, $80,000, THEY ALL

960
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
TOOK THE MONEY AND RAN.

961
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I ACTUALLY AM THANKFUL TO MY

962
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
AUNT, MY AUNT CONSISTENTLY

963
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
CALLED THE UNITED STATES

964
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
CONSULATE.

965
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME OF

966
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
CALLING THEM AND CALLING THEM

967
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
AND CALLING THEM, THEY TOLD ME I

968
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
COULD PUT IN FOR A TRANSFER AND

969
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I PUT IN FOR A TRANSFER.

970
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
TWO YEARS, 2 1/2 YEARS AFTER I

971
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
WAS IN THERE.

972
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
AFTER I DID PUT IN THE TRANSFER,

973
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I GOT TRANSFERRED OUT OF THERE

974
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
BY THE UNITED STATES CONSULATE.

975
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
>> Bill: SO THEY GOT YOU OUT OF

976
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
THE COUNTRY?

977
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
>> THEY GOT ME OUT OF THE

978
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
COUNTRY.

979
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
>> Bill: AFTER ALL THE PRESSURE

980
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
THAT YOUR AUNT PUT ON THEM.

981
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO

982
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
HAPPEN IN THE CASE OF CORPORAL

983
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
HAMMAR AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO PUT

984
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
THE PRESSURE ON.

985
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
JEREMY, THANKS VERY MUCH.

986
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
WE APPRECIATE IT.

987
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
WHEN WE COME BACK, BERNIE

988
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
GOLDBERG ON PUNISH EXPLOITING

989
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
THE CONNECTICUT SITUATION FOR

990
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
POLITICAL REASONS.

991
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
THEN WHY IS AMERICA SO VIOLENT?

992
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
WE'LL HAVE A DISTURBING ANALYSIS

993
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY AND WE'LL

994
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
BE RIGHT BACK

995
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
97%.

996
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Mmmm tasty.

997
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And cut! Very good.

998
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

999
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

1000
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

1001
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It's not real.

1002
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

1003
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

1004
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

1005
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

1006
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
but with ADVAIR,
I'm breathing better.

1007
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So now I can be in
the scene.

1008
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
ADVAIR is
clinically proven to help

1009
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
significantly improve

1010
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
lung function.

1011
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Unlike most COPD medications,

1012
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
ADVAIR contains both an
anti-inflammatory

1013
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and a
long-acting bronchodilator

1014
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
working together to help improve
your lung function all day.

1015
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
ADVAIR won't
replace fast-acting inhalers

1016
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
for sudden symptoms

1017
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and should not be used more
than twice a day.

1018
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
People with
COPD taking ADVAIR

1019
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
may have a higher chance
of pneumonia.

1020
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
ADVAIR may increase your
risk of osteoporosis

1021
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and some eye problems.

1022
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Tell your doctor
if you have a heart condition

1023
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
or high blood pressure before
taking ADVAIR.

1024
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
If you're still
having difficulty breathing,

1025
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
ask your doctor if including
ADVAIR could help

1026
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
improve your lung function.

1027
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Get your
first full

1028
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
prescription
free

1029
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and save
on refills

1030
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
at
ADVAIRcopd.com.

1031
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
>> Bill: THANKS FOR STAYING WITH

1032
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
US.
I'M BILL O'REILLY.

1033
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
BERNIE SEGMENT.
ON FRIDAY, IT JUST TOOK MINUTES,

1034
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
MINUTES FOR SOME PEOPLE ON MSNBC

1035
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
AND OTHER LIB RAT OUTLETS TO

1036
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
DIRECT THE STORY IN CONNECTICUT

1037
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
FROM THE HORROR TO GUN CONTROL.

1038
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
>> WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GUN

1039
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY, WE'RE

1040
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
NOT TALKING ABOUT SECOND

1041
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

1042
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
WE'RE TALKING AS I WAS
DISCUSSING WITH THE BRADY

1043
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS YESTERDAY,

1044
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
ABOUT REASONABLE BACKGROUND

1045
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
CHECKS, REASONABLE CONTROLS,

1046
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
AUTOMATIC WEAPONRY AND AMMO,

1047
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
MULTIPLE ROUNDS THAT CAUSE THE

1048
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
GREATEST AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE.

1049
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
>> Bill: JOINING US FROM MIAMI,

1050
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
MR. GOLDBERG.
WE DIDN'T DO THIS ON FRIDAY.

1051
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I SAW

1052
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
FRIDAY'S FACTOR.
BUT WE HAD THE HIGHEST RATING,

1053
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
AS USUAL, ON THE CABLE NEWS

1054
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
UNIVERSE.

1055
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
WE HAVE DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT

1056
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
POLITICAL STUFF.

1057
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
>> RIGHT.

1058
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
>> Bill: BECAUSE IT JUST WASN'T

1059
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
APPROPRIATE, YOU KNOW.

1060
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
>> RIGHT.

1061
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
>> Bill: THE FOLKS WANTED TO

1062
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

1063
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
THEY WANTED THE FACTS AS FAR AS

1064
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
WE KNEW.

1065
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
AND THEY WANTED TO SEE THE

1066
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
REACTION OF THE PEOPLE ON THE

1067
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
SCENE.
THEY DIDN'T WANT ANY OF THIS

1068
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
POLITICAL STUFF.

1069
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
NOW THREE DAYS LATER YOU CAN GET

1070
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
INTO IT.

1071
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
SO WHEN I SAW THAT, I JUST WENT,

1072
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T REALLY

1073
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
MATTER WHAT IT IS, THEIR

1074
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
POLITICAL AGENDA OVERRIDES EVERY

1075
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
HUMANISTIC CONCERN.
AM I WRONG?

1076
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
>> NO, YOU'RE NOT,

1077
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
UNFORTUNATELY.
THERE SHOULD BE A REASONABLE

1078
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
PERIOD OF TIME WHEN WE SIMPLY

1079
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
MOURN.

1080
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
TELEVISION IS OUR NATIONAL

1081
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
CATHEDRAL.
IT'S WHERE WE ALL GO WHEN THERE

1082
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
IS AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY.

1083
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
WE GO THERE TO GRIEVE TOGETHER

1084
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
AND TO WITNESS WHAT'S GOING ON

1085
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
TOGETHER.

1086
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
THERE SHOULD BE NO POLITICS.

1087
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
AS YOU SAID, IT TOOK MINUTES FOR

1088
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
SOME ON THE LEFT AND THE MEDIA

1089
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
TO START IN WITH THEIR GUN

1090
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
AGENDA.
BUT CONSERVATIVE MEDIA ALSO USED

1091
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
THE TRAGEDY AND THE MEDIA TO

1092
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
FURTHER THEIR AGENDA.

1093
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
>> Bill: HOW DID THEY DO THAT?

1094
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
>> I'LL GIVE TWO EXAMPLES.

1095
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
THERE WAS TALK ABOUT HOW WE TOOK

1096
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
GOD OUT OF THE CLASSROOM, OUT OF

1097
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
THE SCHOOL ROOM, SO WE SHOULDN'T

1098
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
BE SURPRISED WHEN THERE IS

1099
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
CARNAGE IN THE SCHOOLS.

1100
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
>> Bill: I GOT LETTERS SAYING

1101
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
THAT.
>> THERE WAS TALK ABOUT HOW WE

1102
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
HAVE A MILLION ABORTIONS A YEAR,

1103
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
WHICH CHEAPENS LIFE, AND THAT

1104
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
SOMEHOW THIS IS RELATED TO WHAT

1105
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
HAPPENED.

1106
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
INDIRECTLY, BUT SOMEHOW RELATED.

1107
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
>> Bill: LET ME ASK YOU

1108
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
SOMETHING --
>> LET ME JUST SAY, THIS BILL.

1109
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
AS IF AN INSANE GUNMAN, AN

1110
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
INSANE MENTALLY UNSTABLE GUNMAN

1111
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
CARES ABOUT GOD AND THE

1112
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
CLASSROOM OR ABORTION.

1113
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
WE KNOW HE DOESN'T.

1114
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
>> Bill: OKAY.

1115
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I DON'T THINK HE WAS INSANE, BY

1116
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
THE WAY.
I THINK HE KNEW RIGHT FROM WRONG

1117
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY HE KILLED

1118
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
HIMSELF.

1119
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
>> MENTALLY UNSTABLE.
>> Bill: OKAY.

1120
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
NOW, I DIDN'T SEE THAT LEVEL

1121
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
OF -- I GOT LETTERS SAYING WHAT

1122
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
DO YOU EXPECT?

1123
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
YOU TAKE GOD OUT OF THE

1124
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
CLASSROOM AND WE'RE A SOCIETY

1125
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
THAT DOESN'T VALUE RIGHT AND

1126
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
WRONG ANYMORE.

1127
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
BUT I DIDN'T SEE THAT --

1128
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
CERTAINLY DIDN'T HAPPEN ON THE

1129
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
FOX NEWS CHANNEL.

1130
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I DIDN'T SEE IT.

1131
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
>> YES, IT DID.
YES, IT DID.

1132
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
>> Bill: I DIDN'T SEE IT.

1133
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
>> YEAH.
>> Bill: ALL RIGHT.

1134
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
>> HAPPENED ON THE FOX NEWS

1135
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
CHANNEL.
>> Bill: WAS IT FRONT AND

1136
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
CENTER?
'CAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN ON THIS

1137
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
PROGRAM AND I WAS WATCHING PRIME

1138
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
TIME AND I DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF

1139
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
THAT.

1140
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
>> WELL, NO.
THERE IS MORE OF IT ON THE LEFT

1141
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
BECAUSE -- LOOK, EVERYBODY IN

1142
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
THE MEDIA HAS A ROLE.

1143
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
THAT'S THE UNFORTUNATE THING.

1144
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
THAT'S WHY I'M DISGUSTED WITH

1145
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
BOTH SIDES.

1146
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
EVERYBODY HAS A ROLE IN THE

1147
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
MEDIA.
SO THE LEFT IMMEDIATELY,

1148
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
IMMEDIATELY --
>> Bill: BAN GUNS.

1149
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

1150
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
LET'S NOT LET ANY TRAGEDY GO TO

1151
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
WASTE.
SO THEY IMMEDIATELY JUMP ON THIS

1152
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
TO FURTHER THE AGENDA THAT

1153
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
THEY'VE GOT ABOUT GUNS.

1154
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
AN AGENDA, BY THE WAY, WHEN IT

1155
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
COMES TO ASSAULT WEAPONS, I'LL

1156
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
SAY IT, KEEP THE LETTERS -- I

1157
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU --

1158
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
THAT I AGREE WITH.

1159
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I DON'T THINK WE NEED ASSAULT

1160
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
WEAPONS IN OUR CULTURE.

1161
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I BELIEVE IN THE SECOND

1162
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
AMENDMENT.
I'M NOT ANTIGUN.

1163
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
BUT I THINK WE DON'T NEED THAT.

1164
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
BUT THE RIGHT ALSO JUMPS ON

1165
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
THESE THINGS TO FURTHER ITS

1166
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
AGENDA.
BILL, I WROTE A COLUMN ON MY WEB

1167
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
SITE TODAY.

1168
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
IT WAS MOSTLY ABOUT THE

1169
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT PROBLEM OF

1170
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
HOW TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE

1171
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
WALKING TIME BOMBS WHO SIMPLY

1172
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT, THEY

1173
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
SEEM ODD.

1174
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THOSE

1175
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
PEOPLE?

1176
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
AND I MENTIONED IN THIS COLUMN

1177
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
THAT I WAS ALSO IN FAVOR OF A

1178
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS.

1179
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE COMMENT

1180
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
AFTERWARD DIDN'T MENTION THE

1181
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
MENTAL ILLNESS PART,  WHICH IS

1182
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
WHAT THE COLUMN WAS ABOUT.

1183
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
THEY WANT ASSAULT WEAPONS AND

1184
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
YOU KNOW WHY?

1185
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE BIG

1186
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
NAMES AND CONSERVATIVE MEDIA

1187
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO SAY OUT

1188
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
LOUD.

1189
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
YOU KNOW WHY THEY WANT ASSAULT

1190
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
WEAPONS?
THEY DON'T WANT IT TO PROCEED

1191
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
THEY CAN'T SELVES FROM COMMON

1192
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
CRIMINALS.
THEY WANT IT TO PROTECT

1193
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
THEMSELVES FROM THE FEDERAL

1194
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
GOVERNMENT.
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

1195
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
>> Bill: ALSO A LEVEL OF

1196
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
PARANOIA ON THE FAR RIGHT THAT

1197
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW.

1198
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
THE FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THAT

1199
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
CLAUSE IN THERE BECAUSE THERE

1200
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
WAS FEAR BACK THEN THAT THE

1201
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
GOVERNMENT WOULD TURN OPPRESSIVE

1202
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
AND THAT'S A HISTORIC FACT.

1203
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
>> THEY THINK BARAK OBAMA WANTS

1204
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
TO TAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY AND THAT

1205
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
HE'S GOING TO SEND TROOPS INTO

1206
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
THEIR HOMES.

1207
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
>> Bill: IF BARAK OBAMA SENDS
TROOPS INTO THE HOMES, THE

1208
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS IS NOT GOING TO

1209
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
HELP THEM.

1210
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
THE TROOPS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE

1211
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
TO GO INTO THE HOME NO MATTER

1212
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
WHAT THEY HAVE.
MY TALKING POINTS I TRIED TO BE

1213
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
FAIR.
AND I TRIED TO PUT FORTH A CALM

1214
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
DOWN EVERYBODY, LET'S WORK ON

1215
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
THIS PROBLEM SEE IF WE CAN FIND

1216
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
A SOLUTION THAT ACTUAL HEE

1217
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
WORKS.
I THINK THAT'S THE GOAL HERE.

1218
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
THANKS VERY MUCH.
UP NEXT, WHY IS AMERICA SO

1219
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000

WE'LL TRY TO ANSWER IT UPCOMING

1221
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000

00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
WE'RE ON VACATION.
THERE IS NO PLAN.

TALKING POINTS MEMO, STATISTICS

1241
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
PROVE THE USA IS A VIOLENT

1242
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
NATION EVEN THOUGH VIOLENT CRIME

1243
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
RATES ARE DROPPING.

1244
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
OBVIOUSLY WE STILL HAVE FAR TOO

1245
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
MANY PEOPLE DYING IN THE STREETS

1246
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
FROM GUN SHOTS AND OTHER VIOLENT

1247
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
ACTIONS.
HERE IS WHAT CONNECTICUT

1248
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
GOVERNOR DAN MALLOY SAID.

1249

1252
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
AND IF SOMEONE WANTS TO DO AN

00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
ACT LIKE THIS, THEY'RE GOING TO

1254
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
FIND A WAY TO DO IT IF IT'S NOT

1255
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
IN A BUILDING, IT COULD BE

1256
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
OUTSIDE.

1267
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I HAD GUNS, I RAN AROUND.

1268
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I WATCHED THE WESTERNS.

1269
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
AS I GREW TO AN ADULT, I DIDN'T

1270
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
HAVE MUCH INTEREST IN GUNS OR

1271
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
VIOLENCE OR ANY OF THAT.

1272
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
SO ARE YOU SURE THERE IS A

1273
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
CORRELATION BETWEEN WHAT
CHILDREN SEE ON TV AND MOVIES

1274
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
AND ALL OF THAT AND HOW THEY

1275
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
BEHAVE?
>> BILL, WHEN I WAS A KID, WE

1276
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
NEVER BUCKLED OUR SEATBELTS.

1277
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
EVERY KID I KNOW NEVER BUCKLED

1278
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
THEIR SEATBELTS AND WE WERE ALL

1279
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
JUST FINE.

1280
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
BUT BUCKLING THE KIDS IN A SEAT

1281
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
IS A DARN SMART IDEA AND IT

1282
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
SAVED LIVES.  WHAT WE'RE TALKING

1283
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
ABOUT HERE IS A CAUSAL FACTOR IN

1284
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
THE EQUATION.

1285
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I'M OUR NATION'S NUMBER ONE LAW

1286
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
ENFORCEMENT TRAINER.

1287
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
MORE CONTACT HOURS, MORE CONTACT

1288
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
DAYS THAN ANYBODY IN AMERICA.

1289
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I GOT A BEST SELLING VIDEO

1290
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
SERIES FOR CITIZENS, MENTAL

1291
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
PREPARED FOR THE BATTLE.

1292
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
AND WE ARE DOING WHAT THESE

1293
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
VIDEO GAMES, THESE SIMULATORS,

1294
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
THESE MURDER SIMULATORS, WE ARE

1295
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
PROVIDING THE SAME CONDITIONING

1296
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
AND THE SAME TRAINING TO

1297
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
CHILDREN THAT WE PROVIDE TO

1298
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
ADULTS IN HIGH QUALITY VIDEOS

1299
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
AND SIMULATIONS THAT WE PROVIDE

1300
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
TO MILITARY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

1301
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
IN SIMULATORS.

1302
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
THESE ARE MURDER SIMULATORS.

1303
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
THEY REHEARSE THE ACTION.

1304
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A JUVENILE

1305
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
MASS MURDERER IN THE SCHOOL IN

1306
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
HUMAN HISTORY UNTIL A DOUBLE

1307
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
HOMICIDE IN THE LATE '70S.

1308
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
TODAY JUVENILE MASS MURDERS ARE

1309
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
EVERYWHERE.
>> Bill: SO YOU THINK IT'S THE

1310
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
VIDEO GAME, INTERNET CULTURE

1311
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
THAT'S SO INTENSE, SO PERSONAL

1312
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
BECAUSE IT'S UNLIKE WATCHING TV

1313
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
OR A MOVIE, SITTING IN A BIG

1314
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
THEATER WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

1315
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
THIS IS VERY PERSONAL, IT'S YOU

1316
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
AND THE SCREEN AND YOU ARE

1317
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
ACTUALLY DOING THE SHOOTING.

1318
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
BUT I'LL SUBMIT TO YOU, COLONEL,

1319
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
THAT 99 OUT OF 100 CHILDREN WHO

1320
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
PLAY THOSE GAMES AREN'T VIOLENT

1321
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
CHILDREN.
IT'S THE ONE THAT HAS SOMETHING

1322
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
GOING ON THAT ACTS OUT.

1323
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
>> YOU KNOW, 99 OF 100 KIDS CAN

1324
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
GO A LIFETIME WITH NO SEATBELT

1325
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
ON.
BUT IT'S THE ONE IN 100 THAT

1326
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
DOESN'T HAVE --

1327
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
>> Bill: DO YOU WANT TO BAN ALL

1328
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
OF THOSE GAMES?

1329
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
>> WHAT WE NEED TO DO, BILL, IS

1330
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

1331
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
VERY SICKEST GAMES AND THE VERY

1332
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
SICKEST MOVIES ARE VERY, VERY

1333
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
SICK INDEED AND THE KIDS WHO

1334
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
GAVE US JONESBORO IN THE MIDDLE

1335
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
SCHOOL, COLUMBINE IN THE HIGH,

1336
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
VIRGINIA TECH IN THE COLLEGES

1337
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
ARE NOW ADULTS GIVING US AURORA,

1338
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
COLORADO AND SANDY HOOK SCHOOLS.

1339
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
>> Bill: DO YOU SEE A DIRECT

1340
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
CORRELATION.

1341
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
MISS O'TOOL, DO YOU THINK THAT

1342
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
SOCIETY IS BECOMING MORE VIOLENT

1343
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
BECAUSE OF THIS INTERNET AND

1344
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
MASS MEDIA CONCENTRATION ON IT?

1345
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
>> MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT THERE

1346
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
ARE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES

1347
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
WHO HAVE A PROPENSITY FOR

1348
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
VIOLENCE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

1349
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
THAT'S A STRONG STATEMENT, BUT

1350
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
THAT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE.

1351
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
>> Bill: MORE SO THAN OTHER

1352
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
COUNTRIES?
MORE SO THAN AUSTRALIA AND

1353
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
CANADA AND GREAT BRITAIN WHERE?

1354
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
WE'RE MORE VIOLENT?

1355
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
>> THE QUALITY OF OUR VIOLENCE

1356
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
IS DIFFERENT AND WHEN I REALLY

1357
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
TOOK NOTE OF THAT, ESPECIALLY

1358
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
WHEN IT COMES TO MASS HOMICIDES,

1359
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
WITH ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG

1360
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
ADULTS IS FOLLOWING COLUMBINE.

1361
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
THAT REALLY PRESENTED A NEW

1362
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
NORMAL FOR US.

1363
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
AND THAT PROPENSITY FOR VIOLENCE

1364
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
CAN BE EXACERBATED, CAN BE

1365
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
INCREASED BY VARIABLES LIKE HOW

1366
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
YOU'RE RAISED, WHAT YOU VIEW ON

1367
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
TV OR VIDEO GAMES FOR A SMALL

1368
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

1369
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
SIGNIFICANTLY BUT NEGATIVELY

1370
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
INFLUENCED BY NEGATIVE STIMULI

1371
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
LIKE VIOLENT VIDEOS, VIOLENT

1372
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
MOVIES.
>> Bill: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE

1373
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
BETWEEN A CHILD WHO HAS A

1374
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
PROPENSITY FOR VIOLENCE HERE IN

1375
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
THE UNITED STATES AND ONE IN

1376
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
CANADA?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCE

1377
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
IS.

1378
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000

1392
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
STIMULATION FACTORS IN CANADA

1393
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000

1394
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
>> THEY DO.

1395

CANADA HAD ALBERTA.

1396
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
THIS IS A WORLD WIDE PHENOMENON.

1397
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
WHEREVER THERE IS A MEDIA

1398
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000

00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I DON'T LIKE TO USE THE WORD

1447
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
EVIL.

1448
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
IT TRIVALIZES SOMETHING WE

1449
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
NEED TO UNDERSTAND.

1450
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
>> WHY SAVAGES ARE KILLED IN

1451
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
CAMBODIA AND THE ENTHIRE THIRD

1452
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
REICH.
UNTIL THEN EVIL WILL SUFFICE.

1453
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
HORRIFIC SCHOOL KILLINGS

1454
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
HAPPENED IN BATH, MICHIGAN

1455
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
WHEN A MAN USED DYNAMITE TO

1456
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
KILL 45.

1457
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
HOW MANY MORE CHILDREN HAVE TO

1458
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
DIE BEFORE AMERICA MENDS GUN

1459
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
LAWS.

1460
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
>> BRINGING FIRE ARMS IN

1461
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
MEXICO IS A HUGE CRIME.

1462
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
THAT'S WHY YOU CHECKED N. I AM

1463
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
ANGRY ABOUT THE STORY.

1464
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
MY WIFE AND I CANCELLED A TRIP

1465
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
TO MEXICO.

1466
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
IF CORPORAL HAMMER IS NOT

1467
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
RELEASED BEFORE CHRISTMAS, I

1468
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
THINK YOU WILL HAVE COMPANY.

1469
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
THE TIP OF THE DAY, BECAUSE OF

1470
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
THE COVERAGE.

1471
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE FACTOR

1472
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
CHRISTMAS COVERAGE IS ACCURATE

1473
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
OR OVER FLOWN.

1474
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
25,000.

1475
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
AND 91 SAY ACCURATE.

1476
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
NIPE
