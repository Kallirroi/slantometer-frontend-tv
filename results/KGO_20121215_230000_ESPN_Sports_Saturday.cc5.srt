ASPECT OF IT.

189
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
YOU WERE REPRESENTING NOT ONLY

190
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
YOURSELF BUT YOU WERE

191
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
REPRESENTING ALL OF THE BLACK
STUDENTS.

192
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
WE WERE ALSO COACHED UP TO

193
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS A
NONVIOLENT CHANGE.

194
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
NOW IN THE RACIAL STRUGGLE,

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
OKAY, IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS

196

197
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
NONVIOLENT.

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
WE WALK AWAY.

199
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
YOU DON'T RETALIATE.

200
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
VERBALLY OR PHYSICALLY.

201
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
BUT ON A FOOTBALL FIELD, THAT'S

202
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
THE GREAT EQUALIZER.

203
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
NOW I GET TO HIT ANYTHING THAT

204

HITS YOU AND YOU HIT HIM, WHAT

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
AND YOU MAY HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF

211
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
OPINION ABOUT THINGS.

212
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
BUT THE FIRST THING THAT HAS TO
BE ESTABLISHED IN ANY

213
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
RELATIONSHIP, THERE HAS TO BE

214
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000

TO BE RESPECTED WHEN YOU COME

369
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
ANYTHING UNLESS HE CALLS YOUR
NAME.

370
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
YOU HAD TO BE PERFECT IN

371
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
EVERYTHING YOU DID.

372
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
HE WAS A GREAT COACH, BUT HE WAS

373
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
A GREAT MAN.

374
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
AGAIN, HE AND DADDY, THEIR WORD

375
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
WAS THEIR BOND.

376
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
IF THEY TOLD YOU SOMETHING, IT

377
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

378
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
YOU KNEW THAT THEY HAD YOUR BACK

379
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
AND THEY WERE ALWAYS GOING TO BE

380
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
THERE FOR YOU.

381
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
AND THAT'S THE KIND OF MAN I

382
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
WANT TO BE.

383
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
...and this,

384
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
dancing in their heads...

385
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
...we have these.

386
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Home Depot gift cards.

387
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Give the gift of doing,

388
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
in-store or online.

389
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
>>> SYLVESTER CROOM SPENT A

390
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
DECADE ON THE SIDELINES AT

391
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
ALABAMA BEFORE CONTINUING HIS

392
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
COACHING EDUCATION IN THE NFL.

393
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
HE WORKED FOR FIVE TEAMS OVER 17
YEARS.

394
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
BUILDING A STRONG RESUME AND A

395
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
REPUTATION AS ONE OF PRO

396
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
FOOTBALL'S MOST POPULAR AND MOST
RESPECTED COACHES.

397
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
IN 2003, HE GOT A CALL FROM

398
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
TUSCALOOSA.

399
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
NO BLACK MAN HAD EVER BEEN A

400
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
HEAD COACH IN THE S.E.C.

401
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
HIS ALMA MATER WAS CONSIDERING

402
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
MAKING CROOM THE FIRST.

403
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
>> I WAS EXCITED, BECAUSE THAT'S

404
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
TO ME THE PINNACLE OF COLLEGE

405
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
FOOTBALL, FIRST OF ALL, A CHANCE

406
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
TO BE A HEAD COACH, HEAD COACH

407
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
IN THE SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE

408
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
AND A HEAD COACH AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA.

409
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I

410
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
FELT LIKE IF ANYBODY IS UP TO

411
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
THE CHALLENGE OF GETTING THIS

412
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
THING ON THE RIGHT TRACK, IT'S

413
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
ME.

414
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
>> HE WAS A LEGITIMATE CANDIDATE
IN MY MIND.

415
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I THINK HE UNDERSTOOD ALABAMA

416
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
FOOTBALL.

417
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I THINK HE UNDERSTOOD THE ALUMNI

418
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
AND HE KNEW THE IMPORTANCE OF

419
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
BEING AN ALABAMA FOOTBALL
PLAYER.

420
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
IN MY MIND, THERE WAS NO

421
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
QUESTION BASED ON WHAT HE HAD

422
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
GONE THROUGH IN HIS LIFE, HE WAS

423
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
READY TO TAKE THAT JOB.

424
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
>> WE WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT
THE OPPORTUNITY.

425
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I REMEMBER COACH BRYANT WHEN HE

426
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
CAME BACK, HE SAID, WHEN MAMA

427
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
CALLS, YOU HAVE TO COME AND

428
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
ANSWER.

429
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
AS A RESULT, WE SAW MAMA CALLING

430
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
AND I WAS EXCITED TO HAVE THE

431
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
OPPORTUNITY FOR MY BROTHER TO

432
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
COME BACK HOME.

433
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, OUR

434
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
ALABAMA HEAD FOOTBALL COACH,

435
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
MIKE SHULA.

436
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
>> I WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT THE

437
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
JOB WAS MINE AT ONE POINT.

438
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
AND IT CHANGED.

439
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION, I

440
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
DON'T THINK IT WAS A PROBLEM.

441
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I KNEW IT WASN'T A PROBLEM WITH

442
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
THE FORMER PLAYERS.

443
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I KNEW IT WAS NOT A PROBLEM WITH

444
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
THE ALABAMA FAN BASE EITHER.

445
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
BUT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE CHAIN OF

446
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
COMMAND, SOMEBODY SAID NO.
>> IT'S PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

447
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
ALABAMA THAT POINT, WAS NOT

448
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
READY TO HIRE BLACK HEAD

449
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
FOOTBALL COACH.

450
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
THAT'S NOT TO POINT A FINGER AT

451
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
ALABAMA.

452
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
THERE WERE A LOT OF SCHOOLS IN

453
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
THE S.E.C. THAT JUST COULDN'T OR

454
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
WOULDN'T HIRE A BLACK HEAD

455
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
FOOTBALL COACH.
>> I FELT THAT WE NEEDED A

456
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
FORMER PLAYER, YOU KNOW, TO HELP

457
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
US THROUGH A TOUGH TIME.

458
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
AND IN THE END, YOU KNOW, WE

459
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
FELT THAT SHULA'S NAME WOULD BE

460
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
A RECRUITING STRENGTH FOR US.

461
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
HE WAS A GREAT PLAYER HERE.

462
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
GREAT QUARTERBACK.

463
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
COACHED IN THE PROS.
A LOT TO SELL.

464
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
>> I THINK IT WAS A VERY

465
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
REGRETTABLE MOMENT IN ALABAMA

466
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
HISTORY AND WHAT PEOPLE TOLD ME

467
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
WAS, SLY DIDN'T INTERVIEW WELL.

468
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
OKAY, ARE YOU HIRING A

469
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
CONTESTANT FOR "AMERICAN IDOL"

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
OR ARE YOU HIRING A GOOD

471
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
FOOTBALL COACH?

472
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
AND MIKE SHULA HAD THE

473
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
ADVANTAGES.
THERE WAS A PERFECT WIFE.

474
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
THEY LOOKS LIKE THE COUPLE ON

475
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
THE TOP OF A WEDDING CAKE.

476
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
SYLVESTER CROOM WAS MORE

477
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
QUALIFIED THAN MIKE SHULA AND
THAT'S THE ONLY MEASURE YOU HAVE

478
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
TO LOOK AT.
>> WE GREW UP IN THE SOUTH.

479
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I GREW UP IN THIS ALL THE TIME

480
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
WHEN MAYBE YOU WERE THE BEST

481
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
CANDIDATE, OR THE BEST PERSON

482
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
FOR THE JOB, AND YOU DON'T GET

483
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
THE JOB, BUT DON'T MEAN YOU
QUIT, YOU HAVE TO KEEP STRIVING,

484
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
YOU HAVE TO KEEP GOING, THAT'S

485
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
WHAT MADE US SO GREAT SO FAR.

486
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
>> THESE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS

487
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
THAT COACH BRYANT TALKED ABOUT.

488
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET UP?

489
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
HOW DO YOU MOVE FORWARD?

490
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
YOU GET OFF THE GROUND, DUST

491
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
YOURSELF OFF AND YOU GO BACK TO
WORK.

492
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
DOING THE BEST JOB AT WHATEVER N

493
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
IT IS YOU'RE DOING.

494
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
BEING THE BEST YOU CAN BE.

495
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
>> IT WAS A PHILOSOPHY THAT

496
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
HAD EARNED HIM THE INTERVIEW AT

497
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
ALABAMA.

498
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
AS THE 2003 SEASON WOUND DOWN,

499
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
ANOTHER S.E.C. PROGRAM IN NEED

500

JACKIE SHERRILL WAS RETIRING,

504
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
AND ATHLETIC DIRECTOR LARRY

TEMPLETON WAS LEADING A SEARCH
FOR A REPLACEMENT.

506
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
BUT THE PROGRAM WAS FACING

507
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
PENALTIES FROM THE NCAA AND
ALREADY SUFFERING WITH ONE OF

508
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
THE CONFERENCE'S WEAKEST

509
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
ROSTERS.

510
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
>> THERE WAS NO QUESTION ABOUT

511
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
HIS INTEGRITY, HIS LOYALTY.

512
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
BUT HE CAME TO THAT INTERVIEW TO

513
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
TELL US HE WAS NOT GOING TO

514
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
ACCEPT THE JOB.

515
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T WANT TO

516
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
BE THE TOKEN BLACK COACH.

517
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
THE SECOND THING IS THAT, DO YOU

518
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
REALIZE HOW BAD THE PROGRAM IS

519
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
RIGHT NOW?

520
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I DON'T WANT TO WIN ONE OR TWO

521
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
YEARS.
I WANT TO BUILD A PROGRAM THAT

522
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
10 OR 20 YEARS DOWN THE ROAD IS

523
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
STILL A CHAMPIONSHIP PROGRAM.

524
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
IN ORDER FOR ME TO DO THAT, I

525
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
SAID, I'VE GOT TO BUILD IT MY

526
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
WAY.

527
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
AND THAT MEANS, IF I HAVE TO
BLOW IT UP AND START ALL OVER

528
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
AGAIN THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO
DO.

529
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
>> PRESIDENT LEE DID AN

530
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
UNBELIEVABLE JOB SETTING THE

HE LOOKED UP AT ME AND SAID,

535
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
YOU'RE NOT PLAYING FAIR.

536
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
>> I CALLED A GOOD FRIEND OF

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
MILT JACKSON.

539
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I SAID I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE

540
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
THAT STATE JOB AND THERE WAS A
PAUSE ON THE OTHER END OF THE

541
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
LINE, HE SAID, BUDDY, YOU HAVE

542
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
TO TAKE THE JOB.

543
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
HE SAID, FOR WHATEVER REASON,

544
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN.

545
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
YOU'RE THE ONE AND YOU HAVE TO

546
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
GO.

547
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
>> COACH SYLVESTER CROOM, I KNOW

548
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
THAT I SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE

THAT COACH BRYANT TAUGHT ME AND

913

1277
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
EQUALLY AS SIGNIFICANT WITH

SYLVESTER CROOM.

1279
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000

1289
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
BEEN -- THAT'S TOUCHED MY LIFE.

1290
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
A GUY WROTE ME A LETTER THE

1291
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
FIRST YEAR I LEFT MISSISSIPPI

1292
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
STATE AND IN THE LETTER, IT

1293
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,000
SAID, COACH, I'M GLAD YOU'RE
GONE.

1294
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
YOU'RE A LOSER AND YOU ALWAYS

1295
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
HAVE BEEN.

1296
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I WROTE A NOTE, I SAID, YOU

1297
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
KNOW, SIR, WITH ALL OF THINGS

1298
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
THAT I HAVE DONE IN MY LIFE, I

1299

COULDN'T SEND IT TO HIM.

PLAY FUNDAMENTAL PLAYOFF.

1407
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000

THROW THE FOOTBALL.

1412

1419
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000

1420
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,000
>> HOW ABOUT ANDREW LUCK, HOW IS

1421
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
GOING TO FARE AGAINST THE TEXANS

1422
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
DEFENSE?

1423
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
>> THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE

1424
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
SEASON, LUKE HAS PROVEN THAT

1425
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
HE'S A GOOD QUARTERBACK.

1426
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
HOWEVER, I THINK THE HOUSTON

1427
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
TEXANS HAD A VERY, VERY

1428
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
DIFFICULT WEEK LAST WEEK IN NEW

1429
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
ENGLAND.

1430
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
THEY'RE AT HOME.

1431
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
A GOOD DEFENSE.

1432
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
THEY'LL PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON

1433
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
HIM.

1434
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
IT WILL BE TOUGH.

1435
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I'M NOT SURE HE'LL FARE VERY

1436
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
WELL.
>> I THINK THE COLTS ARE ABOUT

1437
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
TO RUN OUT OF LUCK, PUN

1438
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
INTENDED.
THE RUNNING IS GOING TO BE DONE

1439
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
BY THE HOUSTON TEXANS IF THEY

1440
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
CAN RUN THE BALL THEY CAN WIN

1441
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
THIS GAME PRETTY HANDILY.

1442
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
>>> HOW ABOUT THE MATCHUP TO

1443
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
WATCH IN THE GIANTS AGAINST THE

1444
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
FALCONS.
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD

1445
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
GAME.
THE FALCONS ARE SO OVERLOOKED.

1446
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
THEY QUIETLY HAVE HAD A VERY

1447
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
GOOD SEASON.
I THINK THE GIANTS SECONDARY HAS

1448
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
KIND OF BEEN THEIR ACHILLES HEEL

1449
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
AND THE X FACTOR IN THIS GAME.

1450
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
PLENTY OF RECEIVERS, RUNNING

1451
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
BACKING, VERY, VERY GOOD TIGHT

1452
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
ENDS.

1453
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I LIKE THE OLDER GUYS, I LIKE

1454
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
TONY GONZALEZ.
>> THE KEY FOR THIS GAME IS THE

1455
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
FALCONS OFFENSIVE LINE, THEY GOT

1456
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
TO PROTECT AGAINST THE NASCAR

1457
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
RUSH.

1458
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
IF THEY CAN DO THAT, MATT WILL

1459
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
HAVE A GOOD GAME.

1460
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
>> LAST TIME GIANTS WERE IN

1461
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
ATLANTA, THEY WERE KNOCKING THE

1462
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
FALCONS OUT OF THE PLAYOFFS.

1463
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,000
>>> MEANWHILE, HOW MUCH OF A

1464
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
DIFFERENCE WILL CALDWELL MAKE?

1465
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
>> TO MAKE A CHANGE AT THE

1466
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR SPOT, I'M

1467
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THIS SPFANS

1468
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
OUT.

1469
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
HOW FLACCO RESPONDS TO THIS.

1470
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
BILL

1471
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
BILL KNOWS JIM CALDWELL LOT

1472
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
BETTER THAN I DO.

1473
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
>> OVER TIME, YOU'LL SEE MORE

1474
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
UPTEMPO, MORE NO-HUDDLE, THAT'S

1475
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
REALLY JIM'S EXPERTISE AND I

1476
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT

1477
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
FLACCO TO DO AND I THINK HE'S

1478
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT.

1479
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
>> THE QUARTERBACK WHO'S GOING

1480
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
TO HAVE A BETTER GAME IN THE

1481
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
STEELERS/COWBOYS MATCHUP?

1482
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
>> I THINK BEN WILL BOUNCE BACK.

1483
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
THEY'RE GOING INTO A TOUGH PLACE

1484
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
TO PLAY IN DALLAS, BUT I THINK

1485
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
THE DALLAS COWBOYS DEFENSE HAS

1486
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
BEEN NOT VERY GOOD FOR THE LAST

1487
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
FEW WEEKS AND BEN'S GOING TO GO

1488
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
IN THERE AND HAVE A MUCH BETTER

1489
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
DAY.
BEN, I LOVE THE WAY HE CREATES

1490
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
PLAYS ON THE RUN.

1491
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
>> I THINK BEN THE COWBOYS

1492
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
DEFENSE HAS BEEN BEATEN UP

1493
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
PRETTY BADLY, PHYSICALLY AND

1494
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN GREAT ALL

1495
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
SEASON, SO I LOOK FOR BEN TO

1496
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
HAVE A BIG DAY.

1497
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
>> AND THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THE

1498
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
MORE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS FOR

1499
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
ANYONE TO ANSWER, HOW DO THE

1500
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
49ers SLOW DOWN THE PATRIOTS

1501
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
OFFENSE?

1502
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

1503
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
>> I TOLD YOU --

1504
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
>> YOU HAVE TO PRESSURE TOM

1505
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
BRADY.
GET HIM TO MOVE OFF THE SPOT.

1506
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
THE NINERS HAVE THE GUYS TO DO

1507
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
IT.

1508
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
THE SMITHS CAN COLLAPSE THAT

1509
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
POCKET.

1510
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
49ers STAY PHYSICAL, KEEP MIXING

1511
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
IT UP, PRESSURE TOM BRADY, THEY

1512
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
HAVE A CHANCE.

1513
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
>> ALL OF THAT IS TRUE, YOU HAVE

1514
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
TO KNOCK BRADY OFF THE SPOT.

1515
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
THE OTHER THING THAT YOU HAVE TO

1516
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
DO IS CONTROL THE BALL WITH THE

1517
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
RUNNING GAME, HERE COMES FRANK

1518
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
GORE AND THOSE BIG HUGS UP

1519
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
FRONT.
>> THAT'S ANOTHER EDITION OF

1520
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
CATCH 32.

1522
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
ESPN2 ROBERT?

1523
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
>>> THE PLAYOFF PICTURE IN THE

1524
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
AFC.

1525
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
BENGALS WIN THURSDAY, THEY JUMP

1526
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
INTO THE FINAL PLAYOFF PICTURE.

1527
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
THE STEELERS ARE OUT FOR NOW,

1528
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
BUT THEY CAN GET BACK IN WITH A

1529
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
WIN ON SUNDAY.

1530
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
AFC NORTH BEING LED RIGHT NOW BY

1531
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000

1532
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
MEANTIME, NFC, THE FALCONS CAN

1533
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
CLINCH HOME FIELD WITH A WIN AND

1534
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
THE NFC EAST, THE GIANTS LOOKING

1535
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
TO STAY ONE GAME UP ON THE

1536
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
REDSKINS AND THE COWBOYS.

1537
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
SPEAKING OF WHICH, COMING UP A

1538
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
LITTLE BIT LATER, RG3 MAY BE

1539
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
PLAY TOMORROW, SHOULD HE?

1540
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
FIRST TAKE CREW ADDRESSING THAT

1541
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
QUESTION LATER.
>>> IN THE NBA, THE LAKERS BEAT

1542
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
THE WIZARDS, 102-96.

1543
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
SNAPPING A SEASON-HIGH FOUR-GAME

1544
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000

01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
AT LEAST 30.

1549
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
HE WAS HOPING TO SEE THE

1550
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
WASHINGTON JONGENERALS ON THEIR

1551
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
SCHEDULE, EASY, KOBE.

1552
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
SERIOUSLY, THE LAKERS ARE A TEAM

1553
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
THAT WILL TAKE A WIN, BUT WHAT'S

1554
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
NEXT FOR THIS STAR-STUDDED

1555
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,000
COLLECTION?
THE NBA TONIGHT STUDIOS.

01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
FINALLY THE LAKERS FRIDAY NIGHT

1559
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
GET OFF THE SCHNEID A LITTLE

1560
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
BIT, THEY BEAT WASHINGTON IN THE

1561
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
NATION'S CAPITAL.

1562
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
FLIP, WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A

1563
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
TEAM THAT HIRED MIKE D'ANTONI

1564
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
BECAUSE IT'S CHAMPIONSHIP OR

1565
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
BUST.
LET'S START WITH KOBE BRYANT AND

1566
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
THE STARTING LINEUP, WHAT CAN

1567
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
THEY DO TO FIX THE PROBLEMS AT

1568
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
THE START OF THE BASKETBALL

1569
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
GAME?

1570
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
>> FIRST, THEY HAVE TO PLAY

1571
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
TOGETHER.

1572
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
THEY HAVEN'T TOGETHER VERY LONG.

1573
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
THE SUCCESS IN NBA IS BEING

1574
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
TOGETHER AND HAVING CONTINUITY.

1575
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
THEY HAVE A LOT OF NEW PLAYERS

1576
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
AND THEY HAVE A NEW SYSTEM.

1577
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,000
BEGINNING OF GAMES, SENSE OF

1578
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
URGENC

1579
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
URGENCY.

1580
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
EVERY GAME IS IMPORTANT.

1581
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
WE GOT TO WIN A GAME.

1582
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
WE GOT TO GET GOING.

1583
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
GET A RHYTHM GOING.

1584
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
THEY HAVE TO HAVE A SENSE OF

1585
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
URGENCY, LOOK AT THE SCOUTING

1586
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
REPORT AND KNOW WHAT THEIR

1587
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
STRENGTH IS AGAINST THAT TEAM,

1588
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
UTILIZE THEIR STRENGTHS.

1589
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
>> A SEASON-HIGH 24 FOR HIM, HOW

1590
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
IMPORTANT IS THIS BENCH GOING TO

1591
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
BE GOING GUARD TO MAKE SURE THAT

1592
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
KOBE DOESN'T HAVE TO PLAY 40

1593
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
MINUTES A GAME?

1594
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
>> IT'S IMPORTANT.

1595
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
THE TEAMS THAT THEY HAVE TO BEAT

1596
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
HAVE STRONG BENCHES.

1597
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
L.A. CLIPPERS, ONE OF THE BEST

1598
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
BENCHES IN THE LEAGUE.

1599
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
SO, THE TEAMS THEY HAVE TO BEAT

1600
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
HAVE VERY GOODS. BENCHES.

1601
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
THEY HAVE TO GIVE THEM

1602
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
PRODUCTION.

1603
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
THAT'S WHAT MEEKS GAVE THEM ON

1604
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
FRIDAY NIGHT.
HIS DEFENSIVE ENERGY THAT GOT

1605
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
THE WHOLE TEAM GOING.

1606
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
THEY CREATED SO MANY TURNOVERS,

1607
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
19 TURNOVERS FRIDAY NIGHT.

1608
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
>> ALL RIGHT, STEVE NASH HOPING

1609
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
TO HAVE HIM BACK BY CHRISTMAS AT

1610
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
LEAST, REALISTICALLY, HOW BIG OF

1611
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
A DIFFERENCE IS HE GOING TO MAKE

1612
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,000
WHEN HE'S IN THE LINEUP?

1613
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
>> HE'LL BE A BIG DIFFERENCE.

1614
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
IT WILL CUT DOWN ON THE

1615
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
TURNOVERS.

1616
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
THEY WON'T GIVE UP THOSE EASY

1617
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
TURNOVER POINTS.

1618
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
DEFENSIVELY WHERE THEY REALLY

1619
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
STRUGGLED HE'S NOT GOING TO HELP

1620
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
THEM VERY MUCH.

1621
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
HE'LL HELP THEM WITH LEADERSHIP.

1622
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
HE HAS GREAT INTELLECTUAL

1623
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
KNOWLEDGE OF THE GAME.

1624
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
MORE IMPORTANTLY, HE'S GOING TO

1625
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
BE ABLE TO CONTAIN KOBE, HE'LL

1626
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
GET INTO KOBE'S HEAD A LITTLE

1627
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
BIT, GET HIM SOME EASY BUCKETS

1628
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
WHEN HE NEEDS TO, SETTLE HIM

1629
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,000
DOWN WHEN KOBE GETS ENERGIZED.

1630
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
>> DWIGHT HOWARD DOESN'T SEEM

1631
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
THE JOVIAL, OUTGOING GUY, WHAT

1632
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000

BE NUMBER ONE NOTRE DAME AGAINST

1892
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:15,000
NUMBER TWO ALABAMA.

1893
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1894
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
LET'S DO THIS.

1895
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
IT'S BEEN THREE WEEKS SINCE

1896
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
NOTRE DAME LAST PLAYED.

1897
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
TWO FOR ALABAMA.

1898
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
BUT YET, IT ONLY FEELS LIKE 14

1899
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
DAYS.
RIGHT?

1900
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
PLAY THIS GAME ALREADY.

1901
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
WAS THE FIRST OF MANY PREVIEWS,

1902
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
RECE DAVIS AND KIRK HERBSTREIT.

1903
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
>> LAST YEAR'S ALABAMA WIN WENT

1904
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
INTO THE BCS CHAMPIONSHIP GAME,

1905
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:43,000
A.J. McCARRON,CARRON, WAS LOOK

1906
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
DON'T MESS IT UP, WHAT DO YOU

1907
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,000
EXPECT FROM McCARRON AGAINST THE

1908
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
FIGHTING IRISH.

1909
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
>> LEADERSHIP.
POISE.

1910
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
HE'S BEEN THROUGH THIS.

1911
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
HE KNOWS WHAT TO ANTICIPATE AND

1912
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE NATIONAL

1913
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
CHAMPIONSHIP.

1914
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,000
HE'S QUARTERBACKING TWO S.E.C.

1915
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
C
CHAMPIONSHIPS.

1916
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
THE GREATEST THING THAT HE

1917
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
BRINGS TO THE TABLE IS AN
ALABAMA TEAM THAT'S EXPERIENCED.

1918
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
LET'S FACE IT, THEY WON IT IN 2

1919
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
AGAIN, BECAUSE McCARRON HAS BEEN

1920
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
AROUND ALL THAT, QUARTERBACKING

1921
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
LAST YEAR'S TEAM AND THIS YEAR'S

1922
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
TEAM, A VETERAN LIKE THAT AT A

1923
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
KEY POSITION, IT CREATES AN AURA

1924
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
AND CONFIDENCE ABOUT WHO YOU ARE

1925
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
AND WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO

1926
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
ACCOMPLISH.
>> NOTRE DAME AT THE QUARTERBACK

1927
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
POSITION, IN THE EARLY PART OF

1928
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
THE SEASON, THEY BROUGHT TOMMY

1929
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
REES IN AS A CLOSER AT TIMES.

1930
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
OVER THE LAST THREE GAMES, YOU

1931
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
HAVE SEEN GOLSON GET BETTER,

1932
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
PARTICULARLY THROWING IN THE

1933
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
POCKET.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO ASK

1934
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
EVERETT GOLSON TO DO?

1935
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
>> THE BIGGEST THING THAT HE HAS

1936
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
TO DO HE HAS TO BE ABLE TO BE

1937
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
AGGRESSIVE BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

1938
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
HE HAS TO PROTECT THE FOOTBALL.

1939
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
ALABAMA WILL TRY TO COME AFTER

1940
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
HIM.
THEY'LL TRY TO GET PRESSURE AND

1941
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
CREATE TURNOVERS.

1942
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
EVERETT GOLSON HAS TO MATCH

1943
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
THAT, NOT ONLY I HAVE TO PROTECT

1944
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
THE BALL AND LET'S BE CAREFUL

1945
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
AND PUNT, BUT HEY, WE'RE NOT

1946
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
INTIMIDATED.

1947
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
WE HAVE SEEN ALABAMA ON FILM.

1948
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
EVERETT GOLSON HAS THAT BRAVADO

1949
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
ABOUT HIM.

1950
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:31,000
IT HAS TO BE DISPLAYED ON

1951
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
JANUARY 7th.

1952
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I HAVE SEEN THIS GUY GROW.

1953
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I HAVE SEEN IT FIRSTHAND.

1954
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
WE CALLED FOUR NOTRE DAME GAMES

1955
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
IN PERSON.

1956
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
TO SEE FROM DID BEGINNING OF THE

IT'S LIKE WATCHING A DIFFERENT
GUY.

1959
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
>> SEE IF EVERETT GOLSON IS

1960
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,000
THEIEL, ALSO IN THE PROCESS, NY

1961
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:03,000
GOLSON CAN KEEP McCARRON FROM

01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
DOING, WIN BACK-TO-BACK BCS

1963
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000

>> I LIKE THE COTTON BOWL.

1979
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I LIKE THE MATCHUP OF THE

1980
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000

1981
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
JOHNNY MANZIEL, WINNER OF THE

1982
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
HEISMAN TROPHY.

WAS TOLD BY ALL OF THE FANS IN

HEY, OUR GOAL WAS TO BEAT THE

THINK OF VIOLENCE.

01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
THEY WANTED TO BEAT US.

THERE WAS ALWAYS BEAR WEEK AND

2087
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
BEAR WEEK WAS MORE INTENSE THAN

ANY OTHER WEEK IN THE SEASON.

2089
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000

GREEN BAY PACKERS.

2092

WOULD BE GETTING REALLY

2094

EMOTIONAL AND REALLY EXCITED.

2095

HE SAID, YOU GO OUT THERE AND

2096
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:57,000
YOU KICK THOSE BEARS BACKSIDE.

2097
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000

2098
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
MUCH AS WE RESPECTED THEM YOU

2099
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
WANT TO BEAT THEM BECAUSE YOU

2100
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
KNOW THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET TO

2101
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
THE NEXT LEVEL IS TO BEAT THEM.

01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,000
AND HELLO, DEZ BRYANT IS QUIETLY

2169
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
BECOMING A CLUTCH RECEIVER.

2170
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
THAT'S WHAT TONY ROMO NEEDS.

2171
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I'M GOING WITH THE DALLAS

2172
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
COWBOYS.

2173
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
>> SO CLUTCH THAT HE HAS A

2174
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
BROKEN FINGER AND THAT HAS TO

2175
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
PLAY A FACTOR FOR A RECEIVER

2176
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
TRYING TO CATCH FOOTBALLS IN THE
NFL.

2177
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
GETTING OFF THE GROUND, TRYING

2178
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
TO BLOCK ON RUN PLAYS, IT'S

2179
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO

2180
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
HIDE THE FACT THAT HE HAS A

2181
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
BROKEN FINGER.

2182
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,000
>> HE'LL BE OKAY.

2183
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
TORRIDOL.

2184
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
IT MASKS THE PAIN.

2185
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
SUCK IT UP.
>> THAT'S GOING TO DO IT FOR US.

2186
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
THIS IS THE KIND OF DEBATE THAT

2187
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
YOU GET ALL THE TIME ON NUMBERS

2188
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
NEVER LIE, CHECK US OUT EVERY

2189
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
WEEKDAY AT 2:00 EASTERN ON

2190
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
ESPN2.

2191
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
NOW BACK TO MORE ESPN SPORTS

2192
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:12,000
SATURDAY.

2193
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
>>> WELCOME BACK TO ESPN SPORTS

2194
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,000
SATURDAY.

2195
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
>>> ROBERT AVOIDS ONE MAN.

2196
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:25,000
HEADS UP THE FAR SIDELINE.

2197
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
30, 35, TO THE 40.

2198
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
HE'S TAKEN DOWN AT THE 40 YARD

2199
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
LINE AND HE IS SLOW TO GET UP.

2200
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
ROBERT'S NOT GETTING UP.

2201
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
ROBERT IS STILL DOWN.

2202
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
>> I KNEW AS SOON AS I GOT UP, I

2203
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
SCREAMED, LIKE A MAN OF COURSE,

2204
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
I KNEW I COULDN'T HELP THE TEAM

2205
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
WIN ANYMORE.

2206
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO DO

2207
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE TEAM.

2208
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I HAD TO GET OUT.

2209
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
>> THE FACE OF THE WASHINGTON

2210
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
REDSKINS IS A-OKAY, AS FOR HIS

2211
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
KNEE, THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.
ROBERT GRIFFIN III LISTED AS

2212
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
QUESTIONABLE FOR TOMORROW'S GAME

2213
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
AGAINST THE BROWNS WITH THAT

2214
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
SPRAINED KNEE.
CONSIDERING WHAT'S AT STAKE FOR

2215
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
THIS SEASON AND BEYOND SHOULD HE

2216
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
PLAY?

2217
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
THAT'S WHAT WE ASKED THE "FIRST

2218
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
TAKE" CREW.

2219
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
>> THANKS, ROBERT.

2220
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
LET'S EMBRACE DEBATE, RG3

2221
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
PRACTICED ON THURSDAY AND

2222
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
ACCORDING TO MIKE SHANAHAN HE

2223
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
HAS IMPROVED FROM WEDNESDAY.

2224
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
THE QUESTION IS SHOULD RG3 PLAY

2225
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
ON SUNDAY?

2226
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
SKIP?

2227
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
YOU FIRST.

2228
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
>> STEPHEN A., I GIVE UP.

2229
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
YES, HE SHOULD PLAY ON SUNDAY.

2230
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
>> WHAT?
>> I SAID EARLIER THIS WEEK, NO

2231
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,000
WAY.

2232
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
THAT LOOKED LIKE SUCH A SCARY,
BAD HYPERTENSION THAT HE

2233
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
SUFFERED.
THANKS TO NGATA BENDING HIS KNEE

2234
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
STRAIGHT BACK.

2235
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,000
AND YET, ALL I HEAR OUT OF D.C.

2236
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
IS, HE'S LOOKING BETTER AND

2237
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
BETTER AND BETTER IN PRACTICE.

2238
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I'M STARTING TO THINK THAT RG3

2239
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
IS BETTER THAN I THOUGHT.

2240
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
HE'S A CARTOON CHARACTER.

2241
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
THEY CAN'T BEAT CLEVELAND WITH

2242
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
KIRK COUSINS AT QUARTERBACK.

2243
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I THINK THEY CAN MAKE THE

2244
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
PLAYOFFS.

2245
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I THINK THEY CAN WIN OUT.

2246
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
IF HE'S OKAY, I'M OKAY.

2247
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
>> I DON'T CARE IF HE LOOKS LIKE

2248
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
A SUPERMODEL, HE DOES NOT NEED

2249
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
TO BE PLAYING THIS SUNDAY.

2250
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
AFTER HE TOOK THAT HIT FROM

2251
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
HALOTI NGATA, THE WAY YOU SAW

2252
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
HIS LEG -- THAT WAS A

2253
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
NASTY-LOOKING HIT RIGHT THERE.

2254
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
IT WASN'T INTENTIONAL.

2255
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
BUT YOU GET EXPOSED TO SOMETHING

2256
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
LIKE THAT, I UNDERSTAND THAT

2257
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
IT'S BETTER AND IT'S FEELING

2258
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,000
BETTER.

2259
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S NOT

2260
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
LIKE IT'S BEEN HIT AGAIN.

2261
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
YOU NEED A BREAK, TAKE A WEEK

2262
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
OFF.

2263
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
RELAX, YOU'RE GOING UP AGAINST

2264
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
THE CLEVELAND BROWNS.

2265
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BEAT THE

2266
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
BROWNS THE KIRK COUSINS IS HAUL

2267
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
THAT YOU SAID HE IS SUPPOSED TO
BE.

2268
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
HE'S A QUALITY BACKUP.

2269
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
HE CAME IN AND SEALED THE DEAL

2270
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
AGAINST THE RAVENS.

2271
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE A PLAY

2272
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
AGAINST THE CLEVELAND BROWNS?

2273
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
EXCUSE ME, HOW MANY IN ROW HAVE
THE REDSKINS WON?

2274
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
THEY HAVE WON FOUR IN A ROW.

2275
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
>> WHY IS THAT?

2276
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,000
>> ALL BECAUSE RG3.

2277
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
>> ALL RIGHT, THAT AIN'T ALL.

2278
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
THE FACT IS, THIS KID CAN STEP

2279
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
IN AND GET THE JOB DONE.

2280
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
THE SAME KID THAT YOU WERE
WORRIED ABOUT IN TERMS OF

2281
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
REDSKINS DRAFTING HIM BECAUSE

2282
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
OH, MY GOD, BECAUSE RG3 IS A

2283
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
ROOKIE.

2284
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
HE'S SENSATIONAL.

2285
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
HE DOESN'T NEED TO HAVE THAT

2286
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
THREAT HOVERING OVER HIM,
STEPHEN.

2287
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
NO, THE FACT IS, THIS DUDE CAN

2288
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
PLAY.

2289
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
IF COUSINS CAN PLAY AND IS NO

2290
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
THREAT TO RG3, HE'S IN THERE TO

2291
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:19,000
SPELL RG3 UNTIL HE'S HEALTHY.

2292
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
YOU NEED HIM FOR THE LAST TWO

2293
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
WEEKS OF THE REGULAR SEASON

2294
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
AGAINST PHILADELPHIA AND DALLAS.

2295
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE WORRIED

2296
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
ABOUT HIM AGAINST CLEVELAND.

2297
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
HIM AGAINST CLEVELAND YOU ARE

2298
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
NOT WHAT I THOUGHT YOU WERE AND

2299
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
WHAT THE GREAT ALL-KNOWING SKIP

2300
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
BAYLESS SAID YOU ARE.

2301
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
>> YOU'RE AFRAID THAT THE

2302
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
REDSKINS ARE GOING TO CATCH THE

2303
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
GIANTS AND WIN --

2304
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
>> STOP IT.

2305
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
STOP IT.

2306
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

2307
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,000
REDSKINS.

2308
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
STOP BRINGING BIG BLUE UP IN THE

2309
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
MIX.
BY THE WAY, THEY ALREADY HAVE

2310
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,000
THE LEAD IN THE NFC EAST.

2311
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:53,000
>> ROBERT, WE'LL SEND IT BACK TO
HIM.

2312
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
>> SIT AT HOME.

2313
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
EAT SOME CAPTAIN CRUNCH.

2314
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
>>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS, THANKS.

2315
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
ROGER GOODELL, NFL COMMISSIONER
SPOKE EARLIER THIS WEEK ABOUT

2316
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
THE POSSIBILITY OF PLAYOFF

2317
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
EXPANSION.

2318
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
FROM 12 TEAMS TO WHERE IT IS
NOW, TO MAYBE 14 OR 16.

2319
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
16 WOULD BE HALF OF THE LEAGUE.

2320
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
AND A HECK A LOT OF EASIER TO

2321
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
GET INTO THE POSTSEASON.

2322
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
THAN YOUR RUN-OF-THE-MILL

2323
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
FANTASY LEAGUE.

2324
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
MIKE AND MIKE DISCUSS.

2325
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
>> ROBERT, THANKS.

2326
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
MIKE AND MIKE HERE.

2327
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,000
GOLIC, YEA OR NAY ON EXPANDING

2328
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
THE PLAYOFFS?

2329
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
>> I DON'T WANT TO.

2330
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
YOU'RE LOOKING AT TEAMS AT
POSSIBLY 7-9 TO WIN A

2331
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
CHAMPIONSHIP.
HALF OF THE TEAMS OUT OF THE 32

2332
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,000
WILL GET INTO THE PLAYOFFS.

2333
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I'M COMPLETELY AGAINST IT.

2334
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:39,000
>> I AGREE WITH YOU.

2335
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
LY I'M AGAINST WATERING DOWN

2336
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
REGULAR SEASONS.

2337
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
BILL POLIAN MADE AN INTERESTING
POINT, THE MODEL IS 7 IN EACH

2338
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
CONFERENCE.

2339
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
ONLY ONE TEAM GETS A BYE.

2340
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
MORE TEAMS FIGHTING FOR THAT

2341
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
NUMBER ONE OVERALL SEED.

2342
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
AND MORE TEAMS KEEPING THEIR

2343
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
SEASONS MEANINGFUL DOWN NEAR THE

2344
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000

01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
SEASON AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.

2523
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
IN INDIANAPOLIS.

2524
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
BUT TOMORROW, THEY MEET IN

2525
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,000
HOUSTON.

2526
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
CHRISTIAN'S REVERSE JINX WORKED

2527
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,000
FOR THE PATRIOTS.

2528
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
WHO ARE YOU TAKING TOMORROW IN

2529
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
HOUSTON?

2530
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,000
INDIANAPOLIS OR HOUSTON?

2531
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,000
>> LISTEN, THIS TEAM PLAYING
WITH A LOT OF SPIRIT BUT I THINK

2532
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
SOMETIMES THEY'RE OVERMATCHED AT

2533
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
TIMES, BUT ANDREW LUCK HAS DONE

2534
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
A GREAT JOB OF BRINGING THIS

2535
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
TEAM BACK, HOWEVER THE HOUSTON

2536
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
TEXANS EMBARRASSED.

2537
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT TAPE,

2538
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
THIS WAS A TEXAS TEAM THAT
PRETTY MUCH FAILED ON EVERY

2539
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
IMPORTANT GAME SITUATION THEY

2540
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
HAD.

2541
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
FIRST TIME THEY HAD THE BALL,

2542
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,000
OFFSIDE PENALTY.

2543
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
FIRST RED ZONE OPPORTUNITY,

2544
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,000
COULDN'T MATCH IT.

2545
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
FIRST FUMBLED OPPORTUNITY TO

2546
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
PICK IT UP THEY LOST IT.

2547
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
THEY WEREN'T READY FOR THIS

2548
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
GAME.

2549
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
MAYBE IT WAS A LITTLE TOO BIG
FOR THEM.

2550
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE

2551
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,000
OVERMATCHED, WHEN YOU LOOK AT

2552
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
IT, I THINK THE TEXANS OVERWHELM
THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS.

2553
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,000
>> WOW, YOU KNOW WHAT --

2554
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
I'M GOING WITH INDY.

2555
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
>> DON'T DO IT, LOMAS.

2556
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,000
>> I'M GOING WITH INDY.
THIS TEAM RIGHT HERE THEY HAVE

2557
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS
RIGHT NOW, COMING OFF THAT

2558
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
EMBARRASSING LOSS AGAINST THE
PATRIOTS.

2559
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
THEY HAVE MORE QUESTIONS THAN

2560
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
THEY HAVE ANSWERS FOR THEM.

2561
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,000
I THINK THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS,

2562
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
VERY CONFIDENT TEAM.

2563
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:11,000
WE KNOW ABOUT CHUCK PAGANO.

2564
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
THEIR COACH.

2565
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
THEY'RE USING THAT AS THEIR

2566
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
INSPIRATION.
WE DID IT BACK IN '91.

2567
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I HEAD A TEAMMATE GET PARALYZED.

2568
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:26,000
WE USED THE MOMENTUM TO GET TO

2569
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,000
THE NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.

2570
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
THEY HAVE A ROOKIE QUARTERBACK

2571
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
PLAYING LIKE A VET.
>> HE'S PLAYING ON BORROWED

2572
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
TIME.

2573
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,000
SIX TOUCHDOWNS, SIX
INTERCEPTIONS.

2574
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
ONLY COMPLETED 40% OF HIS

2575
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
PASSES.
>> BUT I SEE THE COACHING STAFF

2576
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
LOOKING AT THAT.

2577
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,000
I SEE THEM TWEAKING THE GAME

2578
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
PLAN A LITTLE BIT.

2579
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,000
LET HIM HAND IT OFF A LITTLE BIT

2580
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,000
MORE.
>> THE TEXANS ARE ANGRY.

2581
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,000
THE COLTS HAVE TO PAY.

2582
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
>> ANOTHER BIG MATCHUP IN THE

2583
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,000
AFC, THE BRONCOS AND THE RAVENS.
PEYTON MANNING HISTORICALLY HAS

2584
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,000
PERFORMED VERY WELL AGAINST THIS

2585
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,000
BALTIMORE GROUP.

2586
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,000
TAKE YOUR PICK.

2587
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
>> I'M GOING WITH THE BRONCOS.

2588
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
I CAN'T GO AGAINST PEYTON

2589
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
MANNING.

2590
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,000
LOOK, TO ME ONE OF THE BEST

2591
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
QUARTERBACKS AT PRESNAP READ.

2592
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
IF YOU GO UP AS A DEFENSE, IF

2593
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,000
THE RAVENS GET UP AND THEY SHOW

2594
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:14,000
THEY LOOK TO PEYTON MANNING TOO

2595
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
EARLY AND THIS GUY GETS A CHANCE

2596
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,000
TO DISSECT IT, HE'S GOING TO EAT

2597
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
THE RAVENS APART.

2598
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
I THINK THE RAVENS ARE GOING TO

2599
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,000
MISS RAY LEWIS.

2600
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:28,000
YOU SAY, MISS RAY LEWIS, YEAH,
HE'S THEIR INSPIRATIONAL LEADER.

2601
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,000
HE LINES THEM UP WHERE THEY NEED

2602
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
TO BE LINED UP.

2603
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
HE MAKES SURE THESE GUYS DON'T

2604
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
STOP.
THEY GO UNTIL THE END OF THE

2605
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
WHISTLE.

2606
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
THAT'S MY PICK RIGHT THERE, THE

2607
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
BRONCOS.
>> THAT'S THE SMARTEST THING

2608
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
THAT YOU SIDE THE WHOLE SEGMENT.

2609
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
I'M GOING TO AGREE WITH YOU, MY

2610
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
LARGE FRIEND.

2611
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I'M GOING WITH THE BRONCOS.

2612
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT TEAMS.

2613
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
THE RAVENS ARE TRENDING DOWN.

2614
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:57,000
THE BRONCOS ARE TRENDING UP.

2615
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,000
THEY HAVE BEEN PLAYING WELL,

2616
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
SLOWLY PLAYING BETTER.
GETTING USED TO IS THE SYSTEM

2617
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
THAT PEYTON MANNING HAS.
VON MILLER IS PLAYING

2618
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
UNBELIEVABLE.
THE RAVENS, DEFENSIVELY, THIS

2619
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
ISN'T THE SAME TEAM.

2620
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
JOE FLACCO EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE

2621
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
A GOOD RECORD, NEEDS TO PLAY A

2622
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
LITTLE BIT BETTER.
THEY CHANGED THEIR OFFENSIVE

2623
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
COORDINATOR.
WHAT KIND OF A PHILOSOPHY CHANGE

2624
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
ARE WE GOING TO SEE?

2625
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
>> THAT'S BAD SIGN.

2626
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
>> WHEN COW DO THAT THIS LATE IN

2627
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
THE SEASON, DECEMBER, WHAT KIND

2628
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
OF MESSAGE ARE ROW SEND DWROURG

2629
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
TEAM?
>> IRONICALLY, JIM CALDWELL IS

2630
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR FOR

2631
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,000
THE BALTIMORE RAVENS NOW.

2632
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
MANNING'S OLD HEAD COACH.

2633
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
>>> SAN FRANCISCO AND NEW
ENGLAND.

2634
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
BOTH OF THESE TEAMS HAVE DESIGNS

2635
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
ON PLAYOFF POSITIONS.

2636
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,000
THE PATRIOTS WERE FANTASTIC AT

2637
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
HOME ON MONDAY NIGHT.
TAKE YOUR PICK.

2638
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,000
>> LAST WEEK I PICKED AGAINST

2639
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
THE PATRIOTS.
I'M MORE SCARED ABOUT THE 49ers

2640
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
THAN ANY OTHER TEAM.
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE A

2641
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
PHYSICAL MATCHUP THAT THE

2642
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
PATRIOTS HAVE SEEN ALL YEAR.

2643
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:51,000
THE 49ers DEFENSE ONLY ALLOWING

2644
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
1.2 YARDS AFTER CONTACT.

2645
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

2646
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
THEY'RE PHYSICAL.
ONCE THEY HIT YOU YOU'RE NOT

2647
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
BREAKING FREE.

2648
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,000
IN THE END, IT'S TOM BRADY.

2649
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,000
DECEMBER, STILL TRYING TO GET A

2650
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
FIRST-ROUND BYE, NUMBER ONE SEED

2651
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,000
IF POSSIBLE, IT MAY BE RAINY OR

2652
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,000
SNOWY.

2653
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
IT'S LATE AT NIGHT.

2654
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,000
BIG STAGE.
A YOUNG QUARTERBACK FOR SAN

2655
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
FRANCISCO ALSO.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, I AGREE WITH

2656
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
YOU, MY SMALLER FRIEND.

2657
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT.

2658
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
IT'S GOING TO BE TOM TERRIFIC.

2659
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK AT THE

2660
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
OFFENSIVE SIDE OF THE BALL.

2661
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
GUESS WHAT?

2662
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THEIR

2663
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,000
DEFENSE.

2664
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,000
BIG VINCE WILFORK CLOGGING UP

2665
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,000
THE MIDDLE.

2666
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED.

2667
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
WE DEFINITELY KNOW THAT SAN

2668
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
FRANCISCO IS GOING TO GO WANT TO

2669
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,000
COME OUT AND POUND THE BALL
BETWEEN THE TACKLES.

2670
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
VINCE WILFORK CAN CONTROL THE

2671
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, IF HE DOES

2672
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:40,000
THAT, THEY'LL ALLOW THE

2673
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
LINEBACKERS TO STAY BACK AND
MAKE THEIR READS.

2674
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I LOVE NEW ENGLAND IN THAT GAME.
>> LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

2675
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,000
TALKING ABOUT J.J. WATT, THE

2676
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
MOST UNDERRATED PLAYER THIS YEAR

2677
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
SO FAR.
>>> REAL QUICK, STEELERS AND

2678
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
COWBOYS?

2679
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
WHAT'S YOUR PICK IN THAT ONE?

2680
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
>> I'M GOING WITH THE COWBOYS,
THEY NEED IT.

2681
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000
IT'S A MUST-WIN FOR THEM.

2682
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,000
>> I'M GOING WITH THE STEELERS.

2683
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,000
THEY NEED IT BUT THEY'RE NOT

2684
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
GOING TO GET IT.
>> BOTH TEAMS IN MUST-WIN

2685
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
SITUATIONS.

2686
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
AS THEY FIGHT FOR THE PLAYOFFS

2687
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
IN THE NFC AND THE AFC.

2688
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
>>> HERE'S WHAT YOU SHOULD BE

2689
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
