FOR HIS TEAM.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
SHOCKED.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
>> THAT SHOCK IS STILL EVIDENT

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
26 CHRISTMAS TREES LINE THE CURB

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
FIREHOUSE WHERE SOME OF THE

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
CHILDREN FLED THE GUNFIRE.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
PROCESS OF RESETTLING THE

TEDDY BEARS AT RAM'S PASTURE.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
ANGELS KEEPING WATCH NEAR THE

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
CENTER OF TOWN.

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
AND THE TOWN'S FLAG IN THE

TREE NOW HAS A DIFFERENT GLOW.

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
SURROUNDED BY MEMORIAL CANDLES

25
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
AND THE LIGHTS OF THE WORLD'S

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
MEDIA.
THE RESIDENTS OF NEWTOWN KNOW IT

27
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
WILL TAKE TIME FOR THIS TOWN TO

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
HEAL.

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
BUT THEY'RE ALSO DETERMINED TO

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
KNOW THE WORLD THAT NEWTOWN WILL

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
NOT JUST BECOME ANOTHER WORD FOR

32
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
TRAGEDY.
>> THE TOWN RIGHT NOW IS

33
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
MOURNING.

34
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
WE'RE SAD.

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I THINK -- I THINK DOWN THE

36
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
ROAD, WE'LL DEFINITELY BE

37
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
STRONGER.
YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO BE STRONGER.

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
>>> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

39
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
WE ARE LIVE ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT

40
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
FROM NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, A

41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
COMMUNITY STRUGGLING WITH GRIEF,

42
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
REACHING OUT TO ONE ANOTHER FOR

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
COMFORT, BEGINNING THE LONG,

44
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
LONG PROCESS OF SAYING GOODBYE

45
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
TO SO MANY YOUNG LIVES CUT FAR

46
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
TOO SHORT.

47
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
MAKESHIFT MEMORIALS WE MIND THE

48
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
PEOPLE OF THIS COMMUNITY THAT

49
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
THEY'RE NOT ALONE IN THEIR

50
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
GRIEF.
PEOPLE STOP BY TO LEAVE CANDLES

51
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
AND FLOWERS, TEDDY BEARS, NOTES
OF COMFORT.

52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
IT'S A DAUNTING CONCEPT, THE

53
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
IDEA OF TRYING SOMEHOW TO MOVE

54
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
ON WITHOUT THE 20 SIX AND 7-YEAR

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
OLDS.

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
TRYING TO MOVE ON WITHOUT THE

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
ADULTS THAT WERE ALSO KILLED AT

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
MOVING ON MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE

60
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
FOR OOLONG TIME, IF EVER.

61
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHEN THE STUDENTS

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
IN SANDY HOOK WILL RETURN TO

63
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
CLASS, BUT WHEN THEY DO, IT WILL

64
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
BE IN A DIFFERENT BUILDING, IN A

65
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
DIFFERENT SCHOOL IN A

66
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
NEIGHBORING TOWN.
EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT NOW.

67
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
EVERYTHINGMENT.

68
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
FOR THE FAMILIES HERE, THIS WEEK

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
IS ABOUT TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO

70
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
SAY GOODBYE, AND TO HONOR THE

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
LIVES OF THEIR CHILDREN, THE

72
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
LIVES OF THEIR TEACHERS AND

73
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS.

74
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
THERE ARE THREE FUNERALS

75
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
SCHEDULED FOR THE REST OF THE

76
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
WEEK FOR THREE 6-YEAR-OLDS, AND

77
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
THERE WERE TWO FUNERALS TODAY,

78
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
ALSO FOR 6-YEAR-OLDS, FOR JACK

79
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
PINTO AND NOAH POZNER.

80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
TONIGHT WE REMEMBER JACK AND

81
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
NOAH, AND WE WISH THEIR FAMILIES

82
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
AND THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR

83
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
CLASSMATES A MODICUM OF PEACE

84
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
AND LOTS OF STRENGTH AT THIS

85
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
UNIMAGINABLY DIFFICULT TIME.

86
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
IN A TRIBUTE TO THE LITTLE BOY

87
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
WHO LOVES SPORTS, TEAMMATES FROM

88
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
THE LOCAL YOUTH WRESTLING

AND MEDALS TO 6-YEAR-OLD JACK

91
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
PINTO'S FUNERAL.

92
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
JACK WAS AN AVID SPORTS FAN, NOT

93
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
JUST WRESTLING, BUT BASEBALL,

94
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
BASKETBALL, AND SKIING.

95
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
HIS FIRST LOVE, HOWEVER, WAS

96
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
FOOTBALL.
HE IDOLIZED THE NEW YORK GIANTS'

97
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
VICTOR CRUZ, WHO PAID TRIBUTE TO

98
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
HIS LITTLE FAN BY WRITING HIS

99
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
NAME ON HIS CLEATS BEFORE A GAME

100
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
THIS PAST WEEKEND.

101
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
ACCORDING TO "THE NEW YORK

102
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
TIMES," A FAMILY FRIEND WHO GAVE

103
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
A EULOGY AT THE FUNERAL

104
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
DESCRIBED JACK AS THE KIND OF

105
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
BOY WHO COMMANDED ALL THE

106
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
ATTENTION IN THE ROOM, AND THAT

107
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
HE WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO

108
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
CATCH UP WITH HIS OLDER BEN,

109
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
WHOM HE WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED

110
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
ANYWHERE.
IN HIS OBITUARY, JACK'S FAMILY

111
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
WROTE, "IN LIFE AND IN DEATH,

112
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
JACK WILL FOREVER BE REMEMBERED

113
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
FOR THE IMMEASURABLE JOY HE

114
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
BROUGHT TO ALL WHO HAD THE

115
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
PLEASURE OF KNOWING HIM, A JOY

116
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
WHOSE WIDE REACH BELIED HIS SIX

117
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
SHORT YEARS."

118
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
ALSO LAID TO REST TODAY, NOAH

119
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
POZNER, WHO JUST CELEBRATED HIS

120
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
SIXTH BIRTHDAY LAST MONTH WITH

121
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
HIS TWIN AND BEST FRIEND,

122
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
AVIELLE.
THEY WERE BOTH AT SANDY HOOK

123
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
ELEMENTARY.
ON FRIDAY SHE APPARENTLY HID IN

124
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
A BATHROOM DURING THE ATTACK.

125
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
SHE SURVIVED.

126
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
NOAH DID NOT.

127
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
>> WE ARE ALL COMPLETELY

128
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
SHATTERED.

129
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
IT'S BEEN A VERY, VERY ROUGH FEW

130
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
DAYS.

131
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
NOBODY IS GETTING MUCH SLEEP.

132
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
YOU KNOW, WE'RE HOLDING TOGETHER

133
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
AS BEST WE CAN.
BUT YOU NEVER, EVER THINK THAT

134
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN

135
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
TO YOUR FAMILY.

136
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
>> NOAH'S AUNT SAYS HE LOVED TO

137
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
READ AND LOVED TO FIGURE OUT HOW

138
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THINGS WORKED.

139
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
SHE SAID HE WAS EXTREMELY

140
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
LIVELY, THE LIGHT OF THE ROOM.

141
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
SHE'LL REMEMBER HIS BIG BLUE

142
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
EYES, A BOY WITH A BIG HEART WHO

143
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
LOVED HIS PARENTS, HIS OLDER

144
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
SISTERS AND BROTHER, AND HIS

145
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
TWIN MOST OF ALL.

146
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
>> THEY DON'T KNOW THE WAY IN

147
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
WHICH NOAH PASSED AWAY, BUT

148
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE THERE DURING

149
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
THE WHOLE EVENT, AND WERE LED

150
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
OUT.

151
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
AND IT'S NOT -- SHE JUST TURNED

152
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
6.

153
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
ARIEL JUST TURNED 6.

154
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
AND HER OLDER SISTER IS 8.

155
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
HOW DO YOU TELL THEM THEIR

156
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
BROTHER DIED?

157
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
IT'S THE UNTHINKABLE, REALLY.

158
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
>> IN HIS OBITUARY, HIS FAMILY

159
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
SAID HE WAS IMPISH AND LARGER

160
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
THAN LIFE.

161
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
THEY CALLED HIM A LITTLE SOUL

162
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
DEVOID OF SPITE AND MEANNESS.

163
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
THEY WROTE EVERYTHING HE DID

164
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
CONVEYED ACTION AND ENERGY
THROUGH LOVE.

165
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
HE WAS THE LIGHT OF OUR FAMILY.

166
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
HE WILL BE FOREVER MISSED.

167
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
>> WE'VE JUST SEEN THE EULOGY

168
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
DELIVERED BY HIS MOTHER.

169
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
IT WAS PUBLISHED BY "THE NEW

170
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
YORK TIMES" AND DISTRIBUTED BY

171
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
THE PRESS.

172
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I WANT TO READ PART OF IT TO

173
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
YOU.
YOU WERE A LITTLE BOY WHOSE LIFE

174
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
FORCE HAD THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL

175
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
OF A CELESTIAL BODY.

176
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
YOU WERE LIGHT AND LOVE,

177
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
MISCHIEF AND PRANKS.

178
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
YOU ADORED YOUR FAMILY WITH

179
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
EVERY FIBER OF YOUR 6-YEAR-OLD

180
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
BEING.

181
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
WE ARE ALL OF US ELEVATED IN OUR

182
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
HUMANITY BY HAVING KNOWN YOU.

183
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
A LITTLE MAVERICK WHO DIDN'T

184
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
ALWAYS WANT TO DO HIS SCHOOL

185
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
WORK OR CLEAN UP HIS TOYS WHEN

186
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
PRACTICING HIS NINJA MOVES OR

187
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
SUPER MARIO ON THE Wii SEEMED

188
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
FAR MORE IMPORTANT.

189
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
NOAH, YOU WILL NOT PASS THROUGH

190
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
THIS WAY AGAIN.

191
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I CAN ONLY BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE

192
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
PLANTED ON EARTH TO BLOOM IN

193
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
HEAVEN.
TAKE FLIGHT, MY BOY, SOAR.

194
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
THE WORDS OF A MOTHER GRIEVING

195
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
FOR HER LOST SON.

196
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
ONE THING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING

197
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
HERE IS REALLY TRYING TO KEEP

198
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
OUR FOCUS ON THE LIVES LOST.

199
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
AND THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE HERE

200
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
WHO DIED LED, THE HEROS WHO

201
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
SAVED LIVES, WHO STOPPED EVEN

202
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
MORE BLOODSHED, AND OFTEN PUT

203
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY TO DO

204
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
IT.
THE TEACHERS AND THE SCHOOL

205
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
ADMINISTRATORS.
WE'VE AVOIDED FOCUSING ON THE

206
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
KILLER, BECAUSE HE IS GONE, AND

207
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
FRANKLY, WE DON'T WANT HIM TO BE

208
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
REMEMBERED.
CERTAINLY NOT HIS NAME.

209
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
WE TRIED TO BE CAREFUL AND

210
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
RESPECTFUL OF WHAT THE FAMILIES

211
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
HERE ARE DOING THROUGH, AND WE

212
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT.

213
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
WE TRIED NOT TO INTRUDE ON THEIR

214
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
SUFFERING.

215
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
AFTER LAST NIGHT'S PROGRAM WE

216
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
GOT A CALL FROM THE McDONNELL

217
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
FAMILY.

218
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
THEIR 7-YEAR-OLD GRACE, AMAZING

219
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
GRACE, DIED ON FRIDAY.

220
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I SPOKE WITH GRACE'S PARENTS AT

221
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
LENGTH TODAY, AND WE'RE GOING TO

222
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
BRING YOU THAT INTERVIEW

223
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
TOMORROW.
WE WERE GOING TO BRING TO IT YOU

224
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
TONIGHT, BUT WE HAD A TECHNICAL

225
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
PROBLEM WITH IT.

226
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO

227
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
IT RIGHT, AND WE BRING YOU THE

228
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
COMPLETE INTERVIEW.

229
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
SO WE'LL DO THAT -- WE'LL BRING

230
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THAT TO YOU TOMORROW.

231
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
TONIGHT WE REMEMBER ALL THE

232
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
VICTIMS, AND ALSO THE HEROES OF

233
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THIS TRAGEDY, THE TEACHERS WHO

234
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
DID SO MUCH TO PROTECT THEIR

235
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
STUDENTS AND THE FIRST

236
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
RESPONDERS.
HERE IS WHAT LIEUTENANT VANCE OF

237
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE

238
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
SAID ABOUT THOSE FIRST
RESPONDERS.

239
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
>> THE FACULTY, STAFF IN THAT

240
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
SCHOOL DID EVERYTHING THAT THEY

241
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
POSSIBLY COULD TO PROTECT THOSE

242
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
CHILDREN.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FIRST

243
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
RESPONDERS THAT GOT TO THAT

244
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
SCENE WHEN THE ACTIVE TEAM THAT

245
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
ENTERED THE SCHOOL SAVED MANY

246
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
LIVES.
I CAN TELL YOU IT BROKE OUR

247
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
HEARTS WE COULDN'T SAVE THEM

248
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
ALL.

249
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
>> WELL, LAST NIGHT'S MEMORIAL,

250
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS GOT A

251
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
STANDING OVATION FROM A VERY

252
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
GRATEFUL COMMUNITY.
[ APPLAUSE ]

253
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
ROB MANNA AND RAY KORBO ARE

254
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
FIREFIGHTERS.

255
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
HOW YOU BOTH HOLDING UP?

256
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
>> DIFFICULT EVERY DAY.

257
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
EVERY DAY IT'S A LITTLE BIT
BETTER.

258
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
BUT IT'S A CHALLENGE.

259
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
IT'S CERTAINLY A CHALLENGE.

260
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I KNOW YOU

261
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING IS HANDING

262
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
OUT GIFTS TO LITTLE KIDS, THINGS

263
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
FROM THE RED CROSS.
THAT'S GOT TO BRING SOME

264
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
COMFORT.

265
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
>> DEFINITELY HELPS.

266
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF STUFFED

267
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
ANIMALS AND TEDDY BEARS CAME

268
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
STREAMING INTO THE FIREHOUSE.

269
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
AND WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO

270
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
GIVE IT OUT TO THE CHILDREN IN

271
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
TOWN.
>> YOU WERE BORN HERE, RIGHT?

272
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
>> YES.

273
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
>> YOU'RE FROM HERE ORIGINALLY.

274
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THIS

275
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
COMMUNITY.
I MEAN, I'VE JUST BEEN STRUCK

276
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
ABOUT HOW CLOSE-KNIT IT SEEMS.

277
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
AND PROBABLY NOW MORE THAN EVER.

278
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
>> YEAH, THE OUTPOURING OF

279
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
SUPPORT FROM PEOPLE IN THE

280
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
COMMUNITY AND THE UNITY AND, YOU

281
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
KNOW, THE EMOTION IS
OVERWHELMING.

282
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH OF THE

283
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
SUPPORT WE'VE BEEN GETTING FROM

284
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
EVEN OUTSIDE, OTHER COMMUNITIES,

285
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
AND, YOU KNOW, ALL AROUND THE

286
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
COUNTRY.

287
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
THE PHONE IS RINGING OFF THE

288
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
HOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

289
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
BRING FOOD AND SUPPLIES OR

290
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
WHATEVER THEY CAN.

291
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
>> I KNOW ON THAT HORRIBLE DAY

292
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
ON FRIDAY, YOU GUYS WERE

293
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
ASSIGNED TO A TRIAGE AREA.

294
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
AND IT DIDN'T UNFORTUNATELY END

295
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
UP BEING USED.

296
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A -- JUST A

297
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
SICKENING FEELING, TO BE THERE

298
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
AT THIS TRIAGE UNIT AND REALIZE

299
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
THERE IS NOT PEOPLE COMING IN.

300
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
>> AT THE TIME, A FEW TIMES

301
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
DURING THE INCIDENT, I ACTUALLY

302
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
THOUGHT TO MYSELF SHOULD I BE

303
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
HOPING THAT THIS AREA WAS FILLED

304
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
WITH INJURED PEOPLE?

305
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
>> RIGHT.

306
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
>> I WAS ALMOST WISHING THAT --

307
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
>> THAT AT LEAST THERE WOULD BE

308
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
SOME HOPE.
>> FAIRLY EARLY ON WE REALIZED

309
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO BE THE

310
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
CASE, AND IT WAS BASICALLY SET

311
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
UP FOR NOTHING.

312
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
>> WHEN -- HOW DO YOU -- HOW DO

313
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
YOU DEAL WITH SOMETHING LIKE

314
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
THAT AS A FIRST RESPONDER?

315
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
EVERYBODY THINKS ABOUT OBVIOUSLY

316
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
THE CHILDREN AND THE TEACHERS

317
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO LOST THEIR

318
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
LIVES AND THE PARENTS.

319
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
BUT THE THINGS THAT YOU GUYS

320
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
HAVE TO DEAL WITH, THERE IS -- I

321
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
MEAN IT NEVER LEAVES YOU.

322
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
>> NO.

323
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
>> YOU HAVE A JOB TO DO AT THE

324
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
TIME, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

325
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
THINKING ABOUT AT THE TIME.

326
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
YOU REALLY DON'T THINK TOO MUCH

327
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
ABOUT THAT KIND OF STUFF

328
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
UNTIL --
>> UNTIL LATER?

329
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
>> UNTIL LATER.

330
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
AND EVEN NOW THERE IS STILL A

331
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
LOT OF STUFF GOING ON.

332
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO GET

333
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER.

334
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
>> I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THAT IN THE

335
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS, AND WHEN

336
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
THERE IS A LOT OF FOCUS AND

337
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
ATTENTION THE ADRENALINE KIND OF

338
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
GETS YOU THROUGH.

339
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
BUT IT'S OFTEN IN THE WEEKS

340
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
AFTER WHEN PEOPLE KIND OF GO

341
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
AWAY AND THE REST OF THE WORLD

342
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
KEEPS SPINNING AND RETURNS TO

343
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
SOME SEMBLANCE OF NORMAL, THEN

344
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
IT'S THIS TOWN WHICH IS GOING TO

345
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
BE LEFT WITH AN OPEN WOUND.

346
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
>> THERE IS GOING TO BE A NEW
NORMAL I THINK.

347
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
THE OLD NORMAL A WEEK AGO,

348
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
THAT'S GONE, I BELIEVE.

349
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
>> A LEVEL OF COMPLACENCY ALL

350
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
THESE YEARS, THAT'S GONE.

351
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
AND WE'LL BE SCARRED FOREVER

352
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
FROM THIS, I THINK.

353
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
>> WE WILL RECOVER, OBVIOUSLY.

354
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
LIKE ROB SAID, WE'RE A

355
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
CLOSE-KNIT COMMUNITY.

356
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
WE WILL RECOVER SOMEWHAT.

357
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
BUT LIKE ROB SAID, THE SCAR IS

358
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
NOT GOING TO GO AWAY.

359
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
>> THE SCARS HEAL, BUT THEY

360
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
REMAIN.
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE.

361
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL YOU'VE

362
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
DONE, AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH

363
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
FOR TALKING.

364
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY.

365
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
THANK YOU.
I WISH YOU THE BEST.

366
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> THANKS.

367
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
WITH THE COMMUNITY REALLY UNITED

368
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
IN GRIEF, ONE PIECE OF THE PLAN

369
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
TO MOVE BEYOND THE TRAGEDY IS

370
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
TAKING SHAPE TODAY.

371
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
AND WHEN I SAY "MOVE BEYOND," I

372
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE

373
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
PEOPLE WANT TO FORGET, BECAUSE

374
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
THEY DON'T.

375
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
THIS TOWN WILL NEVER FORGET, AND

376
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
THEY JUST NEED TO TRY TO FIGURE

377
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
OUT A WAY TO CONTINUE ON AND

378
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
HONOR THE MEMORY OF THOSE WHO

379
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
THEY'VE LOST.

380
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
HOW NEWTOWN'S NEIGHBORS ARE

381
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
HELPING SANDY HOOK STUDENTS FEEL

382
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
SAFE WHEN THEY RETURN TO CLASS.

383
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'LL SPEAK WITH THOSE WHO LOST

384
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
LOVED ONES IN PREVIOUS MASS

385
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
SHOOTINGS ABOUT THEIR HEALING

386
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
PROCESS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

387
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
SO, THIS BOARD
GIVES ME RATES FOR

388
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
PROGRESSIVE DIRECT AND OTHER
CAR INSURANCE COMPANIES?
YES.

389
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
BUT YOU'RE PROGRESSIVE,
AND THEY'RE THEM.
YES.

390
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
BUT THEY'RE HERE.
YES.

391
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
ARE YOU...?
THERE?

392
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
YES.
NO.

393
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
ARE YOU THEM?
I'M ME.

394
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
BUT THOSE RATES
ARE FOR...        THEM.

395
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
SO THEM ARE HERE.

396
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
YES!

397
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
YOU WANT TO RUN
THROUGH IT AGAIN?

398
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
NO, I'M GOOD.
YOU GOT IT?

399
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
YES.

400
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
RATES FOR US AND THEM --
NOW THAT'S PROGRESSIVE.

401
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
CALL OR CLICK TODAY.

402
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
>>> WELL, NEWTOWN SCHOOLS WILL

403
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
REOPEN TOMORROW, BUT NOT SANDY

404
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY, OBVIOUSLY.

405
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
INSTEAD ANOTHER, A FORMER SCHOOL

406
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
WILL REOPEN EVENTUALLY FOR THE

407
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
STUDENTS WHO SURVIVED THE

408
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
SHOOTING.
THE MOVE WILL ALLOW SANDY HOOK

409
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
STUDENTS TO RETURN TO CLASS
WITHOUT HAVING TO RETURN TO THE

410
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
SITE OF THE TRAGEDY.

411
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
CONNECTICUT'S GOVERNOR DAN

412
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
MALLOY ANNOUNCED THE MOVE TODAY

413
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
AT A VERY EMOTIONAL NEWS

414
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
CONFERENCE, WHERE HE ALSO

415
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
RECOUNTED THE MOMENTS AFTER THE

416
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
SHOOTING WHEN HE NEEDED TO

417
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
DELIVER TO THE PARENTS WHO WERE

418
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
WAITING FOR NEWS ABOUT THEIR

419
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
CHILDREN, WHEN HE NEEDED TO
DELIVER THE WORST POSSIBLE NEWS.

420
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
>> IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT

421
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
THERE WAS A RELUCTANCE TO TELL

422
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
PARENTS AND LOVED ONES THAT THE

423
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
PERSON THAT THEY WERE WAITING

424
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
FOR NOT GOING TO RETURN.

425
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
AND THAT HAD GONE ON FOR A

426
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
PERIOD OF TIME, WELL AFTER THERE

427
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
WAS ANY EXPECTANCY THAT FAMILIES

428
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
WOULD BE REUNITED.

429
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I MADE THE DECISION THAT TO HAVE

430
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
THAT GO ON ANY LONGER WAS WRONG.

431
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
SO I DID IT.

432
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
>> I TALKED TO LYNN McDONNELL.

433
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
KATE BALDWIN JOINS ME NOW.

434
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I TALKED TO LYNN McDONNELL

435
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
EARLIER.
I TALKED TO HER AND HER HUSBAND

436
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
CHRIS THAN WAIT.

437
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
THEY THOUGHT MAYBE THEIR LITTLE

438
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
GRACE WAS IN SOME PLACE THAT WAS

439
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
SAFE.

440
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
AND THEN SLOWLY IT BEGAN TO DAWN

441
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
ON PEOPLE THAT THAT WAS NOT THE

442
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
CASE.

443
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
SO WHAT ARE THE PLANS NOW FOR

444
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
SCHOOLS?
>> IT REALLY STARTED KICKING

445
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
INTO ACTION THE SAME DAY AS THE

446
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
HORROR WAS UNFOLDING.

447
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
NO ONE WANTS TO SEND THE

448
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
CHILDREN BACK TO SANDY HOOK

449
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
ELEMENTARY.

450
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
THEY KNOW THAT IT'S CLEARLY NOT

451
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
TIME FOR THAT.
IT'S STILL A CRIME SCENE RIGHT

452
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
NOW.
SO THEY MADE PLANS WITH THE

453
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
NEIGHBORING TOWN FOR A SCHOOL

454
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
JUST SIX MILES AWAY.

455
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
ALMOST -- IT'S VERY FORTUITOUS.

456
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
BUT THERE WAS AN EMPTY MIDDLE

457
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED BECAUSE OF

458
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
DECLINING ENROLLMENT LAST YEAR.

459
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
SO THE NEIGHBORING TOWN MONROE,

460
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE TOWN,

461
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
HE CALLED THEM RIGHT AWAY THAT

462
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
SAME DAY AND SAID IF YOU WANT

463
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
IT, IT'S YOURS.

464
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
AND SO THEY'VE BEEN WORKING

465
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
AROUND THE CLOCK.

466
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
CONTRACTORS FROM AROUND THE

467
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
REGION HAVE BEEN DONATING THEIR

468
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
TIME TO GET THIS FACILITY, IT'S

469
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
A FORMER MIDDLE SCHOOL UP TO

470
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
STUFF AND UP TO CODE.

471
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
THEY HAVE TO CHANGE, REALLY,

472
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
EVERYTHING.
THE BONES ARE STRONG.

473
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
IT'S A SCHOOL.
BUT THEY HAVE TO LOWER

474
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
EVERYTHING.

475
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
THEY HAVE TO REPLACE TOILETS TO

476
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
BE SMALL ENOUGH FOR CHILDREN,

477
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN.

478
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
THEY HAVE TO LOWER TOWEL

479
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
DISPENSERS.

480
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
>> DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE KIDS ARE

481
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
GOING TO GO BACK?
>> THAT'S UP TO TOWN OFFICIALS.

482
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
THE MACHINE ROW OFFICIALS TOLD

483
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
ME THE BUILDING ITSELF COULD BE

484
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
READY AS SOON AS TOMORROW.

485
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING AROUND THE

486
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
CLOCK TO GET IT READY.

487
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
BUT HEN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS

488
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
READY TO ASK THE CHILDREN TO

489
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
COME BACK TO SCHOOL, THAT'S UP

490
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
TO NEWTOWN SCHOOL OFFICIALS.

491
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
AND THIS FRIDAY IS SUPPOSED TO

492
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
BE THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL BEFORE

493
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
THE HOLIDAY BREAK.

494
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
SO IT COULD BE, YOU KNOW, ONLY A

495
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
DAY OR TWO THAT THEY'LL BE IN

496
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
CLASS.
BUT SOME ARE SAYING, WE ACTUALLY

497
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
TALKED ABOUT IT WITH SANJAY

498
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
EARLIER, SOME ARE SAYING THAT'S

499
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
REALLY WHAT THE KIDS NEED TO DO.

500
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
THEY NEED TO GET BACK INTO THAT

501
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
ROUTINE.

502
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
BECAUSE ONCE THEY GET INTO THAT

503
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
ROUTINE AND BACK INTO SCHOOL AND

504
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
BACK FOCUSING ON THEIR SCHOOL

505
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
AND WORK, THAT'S GOING TO HELP

506
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
THEM HEAL FASTER.

507
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
>> AND OF COURSE THERE ARE GOING
TO BE A NUMBER OF FUNERALS ALL

508
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
THIS WEEK.

509
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
>> YES.

510
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
>> WE SAW TWO TODAY.

511
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I KNOW GRACE McDONNELL, THAT THE

512
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
WAKE IS ON THURSDAY.

513
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I THINK THE FUNERAL IS GOING TO

514
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
BE ON FRIDAY.
SO WHETHER THE KIDS ARE GOING TO

515
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
GO TO FUNERALS OBVIOUSLY, AND

516
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GOING TO NEED

517
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
TO HAVE COUNSELORS ON SCENE.

518
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
THAT FIRST DAY FOR THE KIDS COME

519
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
BACK TO THAT SCHOOL.

520
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
>> SO TOUGH.

521
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
AND I'VE BEEN TOLD THEY'RE EVEN

522
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
TALKING TO TEACHERS ABOUT HOW TO

523
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
TALK TO STUDENTS ON THE FIRST

524
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
DAY BACK.
>> SURE.

525
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
>> IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS, IF

526
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
VIOLENCE IS BROUGHT UP OR

527
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
WHATEVER QUESTIONS MAY COME UP.

528
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
YOU KNOW, CHILDREN SEE AND KNOW

529
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
MORE THAN THEY GIVE OFF, YOU

530
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
KNOW.
THEY'RE VERY PERCEPTIVE,

531
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
ESPECIALLY AT THAT AGE.

532
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

533
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
TEACHERS, AND WE SAW IT WHEN WE

534
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
WERE DRIVING AROUND.

535
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
THEY SAID THAT CHALK HILL, THAT

536
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
MIDDLE SCHOOL WHERE THE SANDY

537
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
HOOK CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE

538
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
GOING, IT WILL LIKELY BE THE

539
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
MOST SECURE SCHOOL IN THE STATE.

540
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
AND THEY'RE VERY SERIOUS

541
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
ABOUT -- THERE IS POLICE PATROL

542
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
AT EVERY SCHOOL.

543
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
THEY SAID UNFORTUNATELY THAT MAY

544
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
NOW BE THE NEW NORMAL AS THEY'RE

545
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO

546
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
AND HOW TO PROTECT THEIR KIDS.

547
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
>> KATE, I APPRECIATE THAT

548
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
THANKS FOR ALL THAT LATEST

549
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
INFORMATION.
SADLY, THIS IS NOW THE LATEST

550
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
MASS SHOOTING TO BRING THE

551
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
COUNTRY TOGETHER IN GRIEF.

552
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
AND WHILE MANY AMERICANS ARE

553
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
STILL STRUGGLING TO GRASP THE

554
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
ENORMITY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN

555
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
NEWTOWN, OTHER FAMILIES ALREADY

556
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO FACE THIS

557
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
SORT OF NIGHTMARE.

558
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
WE THOUGHT IT WORTHWHILE TO TALK

559
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

560
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
BEEN THROUGH THIS KIND OF A

561
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
TRAGEDY BEFORE.

562
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
AND SADLY, THERE ARE MANY OF

563
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
THEM.
HE LOST HIS FATHER AT THE SIKH

564
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
TEMPLE SHOOTING IN OAK CREEK,

565
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
WISCONSIN IN WISCONSIN.

566
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
WE TALKED TO OMERDEEP A LOT.

567
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
AND AND THE TUCSON SHOOTING THAT

568
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
ALSO INJURED GABBY GIFFORDS

569
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO.

570
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
ROXANA IS JOINING ME NOW.

571
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
AND OMERDEEP IS GOING TO BE

572
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
JOINING ME IN JUST A MOMENT.

573
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
ROXANNA, WHEN YOU HEARD THE

574
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
NEWS, WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?

575
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
IT MUST JUST ALL BRING IT BACK.

576
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
>> I WAS DEVASTATED.

577
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I WAS HEARTBROKEN FOR ALL THE

578
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
FAMILIES AND THE VICTIMS.

579
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
IT JUST BROUGHT IT ALL BACK TO

580
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
ME, AND I WAS VERY, VERY SAD.

581
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
>> LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A MIC

582
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE HAVING AN

583
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
ISSUE HERE.

584
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
HOLD ON TO IT.

585
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
THERE ARE NOW SO MANY PARENTS

586
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
WHO ARE GOING THROUGH EXACTLY

587
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH.

588
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO THEM?

589
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I MEAN, IT'S A JOURNEY THAT

590
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
DOESN'T END, THIS JOURNEY OF

591
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
GRIEF.
>> WELL, ALL I CAN SAY IS TO DIG

592
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
DEEP WITHIN YOURSELF.

593
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
AND IF YOU'RE A PERSON OF FAITH,

594
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
JUST TO PRAY REALLY HARD AND

595
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
SURROUND YOURSELF WITH LOVED

596
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
ONES OR FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

597
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
AND THINGS WILL GET BETTER IN

598
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
TIME.
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S A PAIN

599
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
THAT NEVER GOES AWAY.

600
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I HAVE A HOLE IN MY HEART, AND I

601
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
WILL FOREVER.
BUT I'M JUST PRAYING FOR THEM,

602
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
THEY FIND SOME KIND OF PIECE.

603
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
>> AND I WANT TO BRING IN

604
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
OMERDEEP.
FOR YOU, YOUR LOSS WAS MORE

605
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
RECENT.

606
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
OBVIOUSLY, WHEN YOU HEARD OF

607
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
THIS, IT MUST HAVE ALL BROUGHT

608
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
IT BACK.
>> OH MY GOD, IT WAS SHOCKING.

609
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
WHEN WE HEARD IT, WE HAD A

610
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
TODDLER RUNNING AROUND THE

611
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
HOUSE.
AND WE JUST STARED AT HIM.

612
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
MY WIFE LOOKED AT ME.

613
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I WAS A FORMER TEACHER.

614
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
SHE GOES HE WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN

615
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
RAN.
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN SHOCK.

616
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
WE STARTED CRYING.

617
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
WE COULDN'T STOP.

618
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
>> WHAT IS IT LIKE WHEN THERE IS

619
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
A LOT OF FOCUS IN THE IMMEDIATE

620
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
DAYS AFTER THIS, BUT THEN

621
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
ULTIMATELY REPORTERS GO AWAY,

622
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
AND A LOT OF THE WELL-WISHERS

623
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
AND THE COUNSELORS GO AWAY.

624
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
AND THE REST OF THE WORLD SORT

625
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
OF KEEPS SPINNING, BUT YOUR

626
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
WORLD HAS STOPPED?

627
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I MEAN YOUR WORLD HAS COMPLETELY

628
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
CHANGED FOREVER.

629
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
HOW DO YOU COPE WITH THAT TIME

630
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
WHEN THE ADRENALINE FADES AWAY

631
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
AND THE REALITY SETS IN?

632
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
>> WELL, IN MY CASE, I WROTE A

633
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
BOOK, "AS GOOD AS SHE IMAGINED."

634
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I STARTED A FOUNDATION IN MY

635
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
DAUGHTER'S NAME.
SO I'VE BEEN REALLY, REALLY BUSY

636
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
WITH THAT IT TAKES UP A LOT OF

637
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
MY TIME.

638
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
AND JUST GIVING BACK TO LESS

639
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
FORTUNATE CHILDREN IN OUR

640
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
COMMUNITY BY BUILDING

641
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
PLAYGROUNDS AND HELPING OUT THE

642
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
SCHOOLS WITH SMARTBOARDS AND

643
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
P.E. EQUIPMENT.

644
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
THAT HAS BEEN THERAPEUTIC AND

645
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
HEALING.

646
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
>> AMARDEEP, WHAT CAN COME OUT

647
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
OF THIS?

648
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
WE'VE SEEN FAR TOO MANY OF THESE

649
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
KINDS OF THINGS.

650
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I KNOW YOU WANT SOMETHING TO

651
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
CHANGE.
SOMETHING'S GOT TO CHANGE.

652
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
>> I MEAN, THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE

653
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
HAS TO START.

654
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
ROXANNA AND I WITH MAYORS

655
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
AGAINST ILLEGAL GUNS.

656
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
AND WE JUST DID A WHOLE EVENT

657
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
WITH MAYOR BLOOMBERG THIS

658
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
MORNING OR THIS AFTERNOON.

659
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
AND, I MEAN, IT'S NOT JUST THE

660
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
GUNS THAT IS THE PROBLEM,

661
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
THOUGH.

662
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
AND IT'S BECOME LIKE A DEEP DOWN

663
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
ROOTED SOCIETAL ISSUE.

664
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
AND WE NEED TO KEEP THAT

665
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
CONVERSATION GOING.

666
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
AND FOR US, WE STARTED A

667
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
DOCUMENTARY CALLED NURSERY

668
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
CRIMES.

669
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
AND WE'RE GOING OUT OF OUR WAY

670
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
TO GO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS

671
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
HAPPENING AT A YOUNGER AND

672
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
YOUNGER AGE, AND HOW WE CAN FIND

673
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALMOST AT

674
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
THIS POINT OF SOCIOPATHY AND

675
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
THEN STOP IT AND BRING THEM

676
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
BACK.
>> THERE IS ALSO OBVIOUSLY

677
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH THAT

678
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.

679
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
IS THAT A CONCERN OF YOURS AS

680
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
WELL?
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY.

681
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
OUR SYSTEM HAS FAILED SO MANY
YOUNG PEOPLE.

682
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK CONGRESS

683
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS TO WORK

684
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
REALLY, REALLY HARD TO COME UP

685
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
WITH A, YOU KNOW, GUN VIOLENCE

686
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
PROTECTION PLAN AND A BETTER

687
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO THESE KIND

688
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
OF SENSLESS TRAGEDIES DON'T

689
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
HAPPEN.
>> IT SEEMS LIKE SO MANY EVEN

690
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
PARENTS WHO KNOW THEIR CHILDREN

691
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
HAVE AN ISSUE, OR KNOW THEIR

692
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
YOUNG KIDS IN THEIR 20s HAVE AN

693
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
ISSUE, THEY CAN'T GET HELP

694
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
UNLESS THAT CHILD IS PROVEN TO

695
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
BE VIOLENT OR A THREAT TO

696
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
THEMSELVES OR TO OTHERS.

697
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
>> I MEAN, IT'S SAD.

698
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
MOST OF THE TIME THE CHILD

699
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
ACTUALLY HAS TO COMMIT A CRIME

700
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
BEFORE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE

701
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
TO GET HELP.

702
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
AND A LOT OF TIMES MEDICAL

703
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY THAT HEY, I

704
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
CAN'T HELP THEM UNTIL THEY DO

705
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
SOMETHING X, Y, Z BAD.

706
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
AND THAT'S A BROKEN SYSTEM.

707
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
BECAUSE WE CAN SEE YOUNGER AND

708
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
YOUNGER KIDS DOING SMALL THINGS

709
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
THAT WOULD BE SOCIOPATHIC OR

710
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
ISOLATED.

711
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
AND WE CAN GET THEM TO CONVERT

712
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
OR REVERT.

713
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
>> WHAT HAS BEEN IT BEEN LIKE

714
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
FOR YOU JUST TO WALK AROUND THIS

715
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
TOWN AND TO SEE -- TO SEE THE

716
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
OUTPOURING OF -- PEOPLE JUST

717
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
WANT TO BE HERE AND HUG ONE

718
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
ANOTHER.

719
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
>> I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY

720
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
SPECIAL.
IT'S SO HEARTBREAKING WHAT

721
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
HAPPENED HERE.

722
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
IT'S JUST DEVASTATING.

723
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
BUT TO SEE ALL THE PEOPLE COME

724
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
TOGETHER, WE JUST KNOW THAT

725
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
THERE HAS TO BE CHANGE AND HOPE

726
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
WITH THAT.

727
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
>> I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU

728
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
TALKING.
AND ANY WANTED TO BE HERE TOO.

729
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
YOU WERE WALKING AROUND TO SEE

730
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
THE MEMORIALS.

731
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

732
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE ALL THE

733
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
SUPPORT IN THE COMMUNITY TO COME

734
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
OUT.

735
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
AND IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE

736

00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING OTHER

917
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
THAN THAT, ANY PROOF OF ANYTHING

918
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
ELSE RIGHT NOW.

919
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
BUT SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE

920
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
ECONOMY, BUT THERE IS NO

921
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
EVIDENCE THAT IT WENT BEYOND

922
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
THAT, YOU KNOW.
>> RIGHT.

923
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
>> WHY SHE WAS COLLECTING THESE

924
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
GUNS.
>> RIGHT.
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, I APPRECIATE

925
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

926
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
LATEST ON THAT.

927
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
AFTER EVERY MASS SHOOTING, OF

928
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
COURSE, WE'RE ALL LEFT WITH THE

929
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
SAME QUESTION WHY, WHY DID THIS

930
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
HAPPEN.

931
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
WHAT LEADS SOMEONE DOWN TO GUN

932
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
DOWN COMPLETE STRANGERS?

933
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
DO THESE KILLERS HAVE ANYTHING

934
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
IN COMMON?

935
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
WHAT DOES HISTORY ACTUALLY SHOW

936
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
US?
BECAUSE WHAT IS FASCINATING IS

937
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
OFTEN WHAT WE THINK WE KNOW

938
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
ABOUT THESE SHOOTINGS, ABOUT THE

939
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
PEOPLE WHO DO THEM, IT'S

940
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
ACTUALLY VERY DIFFERENT THAN

941
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
WHAT THE REALITY IS.

942
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
AND OFTEN IT TAKES YEARS TO

943
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
LEARN THE TRUTH ABOUT THESE

944
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
PEOPLE.
CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR.

945
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
SANJAY GUPTA JOINS ME JUST

946
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
AHEAD.

947
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
[ Male Announcer ]
RESEARCH SUGGESTS CELL HEALTH

948
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
PLAYS A KEY ROLE
THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES.

949
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
One A Day Men's 50+
IS A COMPLETE MULTIVITAMIN

950
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
DESIGNED FOR MEN'S HEALTH
CONCERNS AS WE AGE.

951
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
IT HAS 7 ANTIOXIDANTS
TO SUPPORT CELL HEALTH.

952
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
One A Day Men's 50+.

953
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
IT HAS 7 ANTIOXIDANTS
TO SUPPORT CELL HEALTH.

954
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Wooohooo....Hahaahahaha!

955
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Oh...there you go.

956
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Wooohooo....Hahaahahaha!

957
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm gonna stand
up to her!

958
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
No you're not.

959
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I know.

960
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You know Ronny folks who save
hundreds of dollars

961
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
switching to GEICO
sure are happy.

962
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
How happy are they Jimmy?

963
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Happier than a witch in
a broom factory.

964
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Get happy. Get GEICO.

965
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Fifteen minutes could save you
fifteen percent or more.

966
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
>>> IT WAS DEVASTATING TO KNOW

967
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
THAT SOMEONE HAD COME INTO THE

968
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
SCHOOL WITH A GUN.

969
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
THAT ALONE WAS HORRIBLE ENOUGH,

970
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
BECAUSE IT'S A PLACE OF PEACE

971
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
AND JOY.

972
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
BUT NOW AS WE GO FORWARD AND

973
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
WE'VE LEARNED THE NAMES, AND NOW

974
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE GRUELING

975
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
PROCESS OF THE FUNERALS, IT'S

976
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
VERY, VERY VERY HARD.

977
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
EVERYONE USES THE WORD HOLLOW.
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW.

978
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
>> WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

979
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
FOCUS ON THE VICTIMS OF FRIDAY'S

980
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
SHOOTING.
WE'RE GOING BRING YOU JUST A

981
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
LITTLE BIT OF MY INTERVIEW WITH

982
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
THE McDONNELL FAMILY, WHOSE

983
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
DAUGHTER GRACE WAS KILLED ON

984
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
FRIDAY.
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THE WHOLE

985
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
INTERVIEW FOR YOU TOMORROW

986
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
NIGHT.
BUT WE'LL PLAY JUST A LITTLE BIT

987
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
A LITTLE BIT LATER ON TO HONOR

988
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
GRACE, AMAZING GRACE, AS WE

989
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
TALKED ABOUT IN THE INTERVIEW.

990
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
BUT THERE ARE MANY UNANSWERED

991
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
QUESTIONS THAT INVOLVES THIS

992
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
KILLER.

993
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
WHY TARGET AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

994
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
WHY THIS SCHOOL?

995
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
WHY DID HE MURDER 20 FIRST

996
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
GRADERS, LITTLE KIDS JUST 6 AND

997
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
7 YEARS OLD, YOUNG ENOUGH TO

998
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS AND THE

999
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
TOOTH FAIRY.

1000
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
AS WE SAID EARLIER TODAY,

1001
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
AUTHORITIES ARE EXAMINING A

1002
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
COMPUTER SMASHED IN THE GUNMAN'S

1003
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
HOME.
SUSAN CANDIOTTI SPOKE ABOUT

1004
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
THAT.

1005
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
INVESTIGATORS MAY NEVER FIGURE
OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

1006
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
SADLY, THOUGH, THERE IS A BODY

1007
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
OF RESEARCH ON THESE KIND OF

1008
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
KILLERS, ON MASS MURDERERS, AND

1009
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
THE COMMON GROUND THEY MAY

1010
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
SHARE.
DR. SANJAY GUPTA JOINS ME.

1011
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
HE HAS BEEN LOOKING INTO THAT.

1012
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
YOU'VE BEEN RESEARCHING

1013
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
COMMONALITIES.

1014
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
WHAT ARE THEY?
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND?

1015
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
>> ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT

1016
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
THESE MEDICAL INVESTIGATORS,

1017
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
FORENSIC INVESTIGATORS WILL DO

1018
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
IS TRY AND FIGURE OUTDO THEY FIT

1019
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
A PARTICULAR TYPE.

1020
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
AND THEY ALMOST ALWAYS DO, WHICH

1021
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
IS INTERESTING.

1022
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
THERE ARE TYPICALLY THREE TYPES

1023
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

1024
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY HAS

1025
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
PSYCHOTIC TENDENCIES, SOMEONE

1026
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
WHO HAS PSYCHOPATHIC TENDENCIES,

1027
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
OR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN HEAVILY

1028
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
TRAUMATIZED IN YOUTH.

1029
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
JARED LOUGHNER, FOR EXAMPLE,

1030
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
SOMEBODY WE REPORTED ON QUITE A

1031
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
BIT.

1032
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
HE CLEARLY HAD PSYCHOTIC

1033
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
TENDENCIES.

1034
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
AND ONE OF THE COLUMBINE KILLERS

1035
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
HAD CLEAR CLUES DATING BACK OF

1036
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
PSYCHOPATHIC TENDENCIES.

1037
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
HE HAD SADISTIC BEHAVIOR.

1038
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
HE HAD BEEN DELINQUENT WITH HIS

1039
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
PARENTS QUITE A BIT.

1040
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER

1041
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
THIS, ANDERSON, BUT HE WAS

1042
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
LAUGHING AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS

1043
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
ACTUALLY COMMITTING THESE

1044
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
MURDERS AT COLUMBINE HIGH

1045
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
SCHOOL.
THE POINT IS THAT HARDLY ANYONE

1046
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
EVER REALLY JUST SNAPS.

1047
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT

1048
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
IN THESE SITUATIONS.

1049
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
BUT THE REAL POINT HERE IS THAT

1050
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
WERE THERE SOME CLUES?

1051
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
AND THERE ALMOST ALWAYS IS.

1052
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
>> THAT NOTION OF JUST SNAPPING,

1053
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
THAT DOESN'T REALLY TURN OUT TO

1054
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
BE THE CASE, THAT USUALLY THERE

1055
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
ARE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY --

1056
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
SOMETIMES I'VE HEARD -- THERE

1057
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
WAS A SECRET SERVICE REPORT DONE

1058
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
THAT THEY ACTUALLY TALKED TO

1059
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
OTHER KIDS, OTHER PEOPLE WHAT

1060
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
THEY'RE GOING TO DO.

1061
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
>> AND IF THEY DO THAT, A VERY

1062
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
IMPORTANT POINT, IF THEY

1063
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
ACTUALLY TALK TO SOMEONE AS

1064
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
OPPOSED TO BEING ISOLATED, IT IS

1065
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
A GREAT INHIBITOR OF CARRYING

1066
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
OUT THE ACTIVITY.
ONCE YOU START TO TALK TO OTHER

1067
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
PEOPLE, EITHER BECAUSE THEY TALK
YOU OUT OF IT, OR YOU YOURSELF

1068
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
GET SOME GREATER CONTEXT OF WHAT

1069
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
IT IS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT

1070
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
ALMOST ALWAYS INHIBITS THE

1071
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
ACTIVITY.
SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH A

1072
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
LOVED ONE AND OTHER PEOPLE IN

1073
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
THE SCHOOL.

1074
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
COLUMBINE WAS UNUSUAL THAT WAY

1075
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
BECAUSE THERE WAS TWO PEOPLE

1076
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
TOGETHER.
BUT ALMOST ALWAYS IT IS A SINGLE

1077
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
PERSON WHO HAS NOT DISCUSSED

1078
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
THIS PLAN WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

1079
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
>> YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

1080
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
ARE A LOT OF THEM ON MEDICATION,

1081
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
OFF MEDICATION?

1082
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
>> THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING.

1083
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
ALMOST ALL OF THEM WERE ON SOME

1084
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
TYPE OF MEDICATION.

1085
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
AND IF YOU DIG A LITTLE BIT DEEP

1086
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
WERE THAT, WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT

1087
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
THERE IS A VULNERABLE PERIOD.

1088
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
IT IS WHEN SOMEONE IS STARTING

1089
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
MEDICATIONS OR WHEN THEY'RE

1090
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
GOING OFF.

1091
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
AND TYPICALLY THEY'RE

1092
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
ANTIDEPRESSANTS.

1093
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
NOT ALL PSYCHOTROPIC

1094
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
MEDICATIONS.
AT THAT POINT WHEN THEY'RE

1095
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
EITHER GOING ON OR GOING OFF,

1096
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
THEY CAN BE A GREAT BENEFIT, BUT

1097
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
YOU CAN HAVE INCREASED

1098
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
IMPULSIVENESS, DECREASED

1099
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
JUDGMENT AND LOSS OF TOUCH WITH

1100
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
REALITY.

1101
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
THOSE ARE THE THREE SYMPTOMS

1102
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
THAT THEY DESCRIBED TO ME.

1103
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
AND REMEMBER, ANDERSON, THEY

1104
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
SHOULD BE MONITORED AT THAT

1105
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
TIME.

1106
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
BUT IN A MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM

1107
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
THE WAY IT IS NOW, THEY GET THE

1108
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
PRESCRIPTION, AND HARDLY ANY

1109
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
FOLLOW-UP.

1110
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
>> DOCTORS HAVE TOLD ME THAT IF

1111
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
YOU ARE ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND

1112
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
YOU JUST STOP, THAT YOU SHOULD

1113
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
NOT JUST STOP.

1114
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
YOU REALLY NEED TO BE UNDER

1115
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
SUPERVISION AND TAPER OFF.

1116
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> AND IT SEEMS LIKE SOME OF

1117
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
THESE PEOPLE DIDN'T.

1118
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
>> NO.

1119
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
AND YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE

1120
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
MONITORING NOTION INVOLVES

1121
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
BUILDING TRUST WITH A

1122
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
PSYCHIATRIST, BEING ABLE TO CALL

1123
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
THAT PERSON, NOT SIMPLY GETTING

1124
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
A PRESCRIPTION.
AND, YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T TO

1125
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
INDICT THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

1126
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
BUT IT'S BASICALLY SAYING THERE

1127
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
IS NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES.

1128
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
THEY CAN BARELY SEE THE PEOPLE

1129
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
THAT THEY NEED TO SEE.

1130
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
THIS IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO

1131
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
MONITOR THEM, AGAIN, AT THESE

1132
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
VULNERABLE PERIODS, IT'S NOT

1133
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
HAPPENING.

1134
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I TALKED TO SEVERAL OF THEM.

1135
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
THIS IS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING

1136
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
FOR THEM.

1137
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
>> ALSO OVER THE YEARS THERE HAS

1138
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE

1139
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
RIGHTS OF THE PATIENT,

1140
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
UNDERSTANDABLY, BECAUSE THERE

1141
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
WERE ABUSES BEFORE.

1142
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I GUESS I WONDER, HAS IT GONE

1143
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
TOO FAR?
I'VE HEARD FROM PARENTS WHO SAY

1144
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TROUBLES

1145
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
WITH A CHILD OR WITH EVEN AN

1146
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
ADULT CHILD, BUT THEY CAN'T DO

1147
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
SOMETHING UNLESS THAT PERSON HAS

1148
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
COMMITTED A CRIME OR IS PROVEN

1149
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
TO BE DANGEROUS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1150
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
EMINENT THREAT TO THEMSELVES OR

1151
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
TO OTHERS.

1152
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
WHAT AN UNBELIEVABLE STANDARD.

1153
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
THINK ABOUT IT.

1154
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
IT'S LIKE SAYING YOU WOULD HAVE

1155
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
TO BE HAVING A HEART ATTACK TO

1156
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
BE TREATED FOR YOUR HEART

1157
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
DISEASE.

1158
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

1159
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING WE

1160
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
THINK OF AS DOCTORS.

1161
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
THE OTHER OPTION IS BASICALLY TO

1162
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
PUT THEM INTO THE CRIMINAL

1163
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

1164
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
AND NOW YOU'RE ASKING PARENTS TO

1165
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
ESSENTIALLY CREATE A POLICE
RECORD FOR YOUR CHILD.

1166
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
>> AND FRANKLY, THAT IS THE

1167
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
REALITY THAT IS HAPPENING.

1168
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I MEAN, OUR PRISONS ARE FULL OF

1169
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL ISSUES.

1170
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1171
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
PEOPLE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THIS

1172
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
NOTION THAT FAMILIES ARE DENYING

1173
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
THE SNI

1174
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
THE, SYMPTOMS THEY'RE IGNORING

1175
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
THEM.

1176
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
THEY'RE ANGUISH OVER WHAT IS

1177
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
HAPPENING WITH THEIR CHILDREN.
EVEN IF THEY GET THE MEDS, THEY

1178
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
ARE TO BE MONITORED, ESPECIALLY

1179
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
WHEN GOING ON AND OFF.

1180
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
AND THEY DON'T GET THAT.

1181
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
THERE ARE SO MANY POTENTIAL

1182
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
BREAKDOWNS IN THE SYSTEM.

1183
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
THESE ARE FIXABLE PROBLEMS.

1184
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
BUT IT'S NOT WORKING THE WAY IT.

1185
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
>> AND THERE JUST NEEDS TO BE A

1186
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
WILL AND A CONTINUED DISCUSSION.

1187
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
OFTEN WE DISCUSS THESE THINGS IN

1188
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
THE MEDIA IN THE WAKE OF

1189
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND STOP,

1190
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
AND NOTHING EVER CHANGES.

1191
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
SANJAY, I APPRECIATE THE REPORT.

1192
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT

1193
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
MASKED SHOOTERS ARE LONERS THAT

1194
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
SIMPLY SNAP AS SANJAY SAID AND

1195
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
GO ON KILLING SPREES.

1196
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
IN HER BOOK "RAMPAGE," CATHERINE

1197
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
NEWMAN SAYS IT'S NOT THAT

1198
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
SIMPLE, NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

1199
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
SHE HAS DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH

1200
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
ON SCHOOL SHOOTINGS.

1201
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING BACK ON

1202
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
THE PROGRAM.

1203
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
YOU'VE STUDIED RAMPAGE SHOOTINGS

1204
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
LIKE THE ONE DATING BACK TO THE

1205
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
1970s.
YOU SAY THERE ARE A LOT OF MYTHS

1206
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
ABOUT THEM.

1207
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
TALK TO ME ABOUT SOME OF THE
MYTHS.

1208
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
>> ONE OF THE MYTHS IS THE IDEA

1209
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
THAT PEOPLE SNAP.

1210
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
BUT WE FOUND THAT SOMETIMES THEY

1211
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
PLAN THESE THINGS AS MUCH AS

1212
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
NINE MONTHS IN ADVANCE.

1213
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
ANOTHER MYTH IS THAT THEY ARE

1214
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
LONERS.

1215
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
THEY'RE VERY RARELY LONERS, BUT

1216
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT OF

1217
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
TROUBLE IN THEIR SOCIAL

1218
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
INTERACTIONS THERE IS FRICTION

1219
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
ALL AROUND THEM.

1220
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I HAVE TO SAY CONTRARY TO WHAT

1221
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT, IN

1222
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
THE CASE OF THE SHOOTERS WE
LOOKED AT, THEY WERE ALMOST

1223
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
NEVER DIAGNOSED OR UNDER

1224
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
TREATMENT.

1225
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
AND SO THEY'RE OFTEN PEOPLE WHO

1226
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
ARE COMPLETELY MISSED BY THE

1227
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

1228
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
AND WE FIND OUT ABOUT THEIR

1229
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
MENTAL DISORDERS IN FORENSIC

1230
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
SEGMENTS AFTER THE FACT.

1231
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
WE ALSO DISCOVER THAT THEY TELL

1232
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
PEOPLE A LOT ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE

1233
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
PLANNING TO DO, BUT THEY DO SO

1234
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
IN A WAY THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT

1235
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
TO INTERPRET.

1236
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
THEY SAY THINGS THAT ARE RATHER

1237
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
VEILED AND CONFUSING.

1238
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
AND BECAUSE WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO

1239
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
IS SO OUTLANDISH AND SO

1240
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
INCONCEIVABLE, THE PEOPLE AROUND
THEM DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO

1241
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
INTERPRET WHAT THEY'VE HEARD.

1242
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
SO THEY GET A LOT OF INFORMATION

1243
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
CIRCULATING, BUT THAT DOESN'T

1244
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
COME TO THE ADULTS WHO MIGHT BE

1245
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
ABLE TO INTERVENE BECAUSE THE

1246
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
KIDS HAVE A HARD TIME

1247
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
INTERPRETING EXACTLY WHAT THOSE

1248
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
VEILED WARNINGS MEAN.

1249
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
>> I MEAN, WE SEEM TO SEE MOSTLY

1250
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
MALES, YOUNG MALES COMMITTING

1251
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
THESE HORRIBLE CRIMES.

1252
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
IS THERE -- IS THERE A REASON
WHY THAT IS?

1253
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
>> WELL, GIRLS DO OTHER THINGS,

1254
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT ARE

1255
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
DAMAGING TO THEMSELVES.
BUT THEY TEND TO BE TURNING

1256
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
INWARD, WHERE AS BOYS TEND TO BE

1257
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
EXPLODING OUTWARD.

1258
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
AND THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE

1259
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
IMAGES THAT THEY RECEIVE IN

1260
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
POPULAR CULTURE, WHICH LIONIZE

1261
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
THIS KIND OF VIOLENCE.

1262
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
OBVIOUSLY NOT AGAINST CHILDREN,

1263
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
BUT THE TRENCH COAT MAFIA, THE

1264
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
SORT OF GUNMAN IS A FIGURE WE

1265
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
RECOGNIZE.

1266
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
AND FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THESE

1267
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
VERY MARGINAL BOYS, IT LOOKS

1268
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
MORE APPEALING THAN THE DWEEBIE

1269
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
LONER MISFIT.

1270
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
AND SO WHAT THEY'RE SEEKING TO

1271
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
DO MOST OF THE TIME IS SOLVE A

1272
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
PROBLEM.

1273
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
AND THE PROBLEM IS THEY DON'T

1274
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
LIKE THE WAY OTHER PEOPLE

1275
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
PERCEIVE THEM, AND THEY WANT TO

1276
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
CHANGE IT.
AND WHEN THEY START TALKING

1277
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
ABOUT SHOOTING PEOPLE, ALL OF

1278
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
THE SUDDEN THOSE PEER GROUPS

1279
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
START PAYING ATTENTION TO THEM.

1280
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
AND NOW THEY'VE MADE A

1281
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
COMMITMENT OR PROMISE WHAT
THEY'RE GOING TO DO, AND THEY

1282
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
FIND THEY CAN'T BACK DOWN OUT OF

1283
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
IT OR IT WOULD BE ONE MORE
SOCIAL FAILURE.

1284
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
>> THAT'S INTERESTING.

1285
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
SO IN SOME CASES, ACTUALLY

1286
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
TALKING ABOUT IT, HAVING SAID

1287
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
SOMETHING TO OTHERS, IT KIND OF

1288
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
BUILDS UP THE MOMENTUM OR THE

1289
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
PRESSURE FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY

1290
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
ACT OUT ON IT?

1291
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
>> IT DOES, ANDERSON.

1292
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I MEAN, THEY'RE USUALLY QUITE

1293
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
AMBIVALENT ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE

1294
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
GOING TO DO.

1295
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
BUT WHAT PUSHES THEM PAST THE

1296
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
AMBIVALENCE IS THE POSSIBILITY

1297
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE ONE MORE

1298
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
COMPLETE SOCIAL DISASTER IN

1299
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
WHICH THEY'VE MADE PROMISES, AND

1300
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
NOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FULFILL

1301
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
THEM, AND EVERYBODY IS GOING TO

1302
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
BE LAUGHING AT THEM NOW.

1303
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
AND IT IS AMAZING HOW MUCH THAT

1304
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
MOTIVES THIS BEHAVIOR.
THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT HOW

1305
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL PEOPLE OR

1306
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
DESTROY A TOWN.

1307
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW OTHER

1308
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE THEM

1309
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
DIFFERENTLY.
LOOK AT THE PICTURES OF THE

1310
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
SHOOTER IN THE VIRGINIA TECH

1311
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
CASE.
THERE HE WAS WITH GUNS BLAZING

1312
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
AND A FLAK JACKET, AND HE LOOKS

1313
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
LIKE RAMBO.

1314
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
WELL, THAT LOOKS A LOT BETTER TO

1315
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
HIM, I'M SORRY TO SAY THAN THE

1316
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
DWEEBIE IMAGE OF THE REJECT AND

1317
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
MISFIT.

1318
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
>> AND JUST VERY BRIEFLY,

1319
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000

1320
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
DOES THAT -- HAVE YOU SEEN ANY

1321
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
LINK?

1322
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
>> THERE IS A LINK, ANDERSON,

1323
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
BUT IT'S NOT THE LINK WE USUALLY

1324
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
THINK OF.

1325
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
OFTEN PEOPLE THINK THAT VIDEO

1326
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
GAMES WILL SOMEHOW INSPIRE

1327
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
PEOPLE TO FEEL RAGE AND GO OUT

1328
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
AND ENACT IT.

1329
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
INSTEAD, WHAT WE SAW WAS THAT

1330
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
VIDEO GAMES JUST LIKE FILMS

1331
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
PRESENT AN IMAGE OF MASCULINITY

1332
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
THAT IS TIED TO VIOLENCE, AND

1333
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
SORT OF GLAMOURIZES IT, AND

1334
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
MAKES THESE BOYS WHO DON'T FEEL

1335
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
VERY GLAMOROUS THAT IF THEY CAN

1336
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
JUST DO THAT, OTHER PEOPLE ARE

1337
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
GOING TO TURN AROUND AND LOOK AT

1338
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
THEM DIFFERENTLY.

1339
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
RATHER THAN INSPIRING A KIND OF

1340
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
BOILING RAGE, WHAT IT DOES IS

1341
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
PRESENT AN IMAGE OF HOW A

1342
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000

1343
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
ACT AND BE NOTICED.

1344
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000

00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
UPSIDE DOWN.

1456
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
IF THEY ARE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN

1457
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
AND THEY FLAIL, THEY CAN'T BE A

1458
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
COMFORT DOG?

1459
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
>> RIGHT.

1460
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
OUR INITIAL SCREENING IS IF THEY

1461
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
CAN BE RELAXED IN THAT POSITION,

1462
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
THEN WE START THE NEXT PROCESS,

1463
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
WHICH IS A TRAIN THEY'RE WORKS

1464
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
WITH THEM ONE-ON-ONE FOR THE

1465
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
NEXT EIGHT MONTHS TO A YEAR.

1466
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
>> Reporter: AND WHERE ELSE HAVE
YOUR DOGS BEEN?

1467
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
WHAT OTHER DISASTERS?

1468
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
>> OUR DOGS A MONTH AGO WHEN

1469
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
SANDY HIT, WE WERE OUT IN NEW

1470
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
YORK AND NEW JERSEY.

1471
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
WE HAVE BEEN IN INDIANA WITH THE

1472
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
FLOODINGS.
WE HAD DOGS OUT IN JOPLIN,

1473
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
MISSOURI.
>> Reporter: COME HERE!

1474
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
THIS IS LUTHER.

1475
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
HE IS A COMFORT DOG.

1476
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
YOU CAN PET HIM.

1477
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
IT SAYS RIGHT HERE, "PLEASE PET

1478
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
ME."
HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU SEE A

1479
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
CHILD COME UP TO ONE OF YOUR

1480
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
DOGS WHO HAS BEEN IN THIS

1481
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
SITUATION AND HAS A BIG SMILE ON

1482
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
THEIR FACE?

1483
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
>> TEARS.

1484
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
THEY SMILE, I CRY.

1485
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
>> Reporter: AND AMID THE

1486
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
CONTINUING SADNESS HERE, THERE
WERE A LOT OF SMILES.

1487
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
>> NOTHING BETTER THAN SEEING

1488
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
DOG'S TAIL WAGGING LIKE THAT.

1489
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
GARY TUCHMAN JOINS ME NOW.

1490
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
THE DOGS WERE GREAT.

1491
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
WERE YOU ABLE TO TELL THE HOW

1492
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
THE PARENTS OF SANDY HOOK

1493
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
REACTED TO THEM?

1494
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
>> IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO HEAR

1495
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
WHAT YOU SAID.

1496
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I THINK YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT HOW

1497
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
THIS ALL WORKS.

1498
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
LET ME TELL YOU MY UNSCIENTIFIC

1499
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
FINES OF WHAT I LEARNED TODAY.

1500
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
KIDS LOVE STUFFED ANIMALS,

1501
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
ESPECIALLY BIG STUFFED ANIMALS.

1502
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
THESE ARE BASICALLY BIG STUFFED

1503
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
ANIMALS THAT WALK, WAG THEIR

1504
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
TAILS AND LICK.

1505
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
THEY DON'T BITE, THEY DON'T

1506
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
GROWL, AND THEY WANT TO BE

1507
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
PETTED 100% OF THE TIME.

1508
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
IT'S VERY COMFORTING FOR THE

1509
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
CHILDREN.
THIS IS THE EXACT ANTITHESIS OF

1510
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS TOWN ON

1511
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
FRIDAY.
>> YEAH, GARY, I APPRECIATE THAT

1512
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
REPORT.
BRINGING A SMILE TO A LOT OF

1513
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
PEOPLE'S FACES TODAY.

1514
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
GARY, THANKS.
>>> COMING UP NEXT, THE PARENTS

1515
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
OF GRACE McDONNELL REMEMBER

1516
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
THEIR DAUGHTER, THE AMAZING GIRL

1517
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
THEY CALLED GRACIE.

1518
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
>>> LOOKING AT PICTURES OF A

1519
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
LIVE VIGIL AT THE MAKESHIFT

1520
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
MEMORIAL THAT IS GROWING WITH

1521
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
EACH PASSING DAY AND NIGHT.

1522
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
EARLIER I MENTIONED I SPOKE WITH

1523
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
THE PARENTS OF GRACE McDONNELL.

1524
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
TODAY THEY INVITED US INTO THEIR

1525
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
HOME.

1526
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
THEY WANTED TO SPEAK ABOUT THEIR

1527
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
DAUGHTER.
CHRIS AND LYNN McDONNELL HELPED

1528
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
US TO GET TO KNOW GRACE AND THE

1529
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
HAPPINESS THEY BROUGHT THEM AND

1530
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
THEIR SON JACK AND EVERYONE SHE

1531
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
TOUCHED.
WE'RE GOING TO BRING YOU THAT

1532
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
FULL INTERVIEW TOMORROW.

1533
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
WE'RE GOING TO SHARE SOME OF

1534
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
WHAT THEY SAID WITH YOU TONIGHT.

1535
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
LYNN McDONNELL TOLD US HOW THEY

1536
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
DON'T WANT TO HAVE HATE IN THEIR
HEARTS WHAT HAPPENED.

1537
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
LISTEN TO SOME OF WHAT SHE HAD
TO SAY.

1538
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,000
>> I HAD SAID THAT TO JACK, THAT

1539
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
IT'S OKAY TO BE ANGRY BECAUSE

1540
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
SURE, WE HAVE ANGER AND WE'RE

1541
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
UPSET AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY.

1542
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
BUT I TOLD JACK THAT HE COULD

1543
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
NEVER LIVE WITH HATE.

1544
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
GRACE DIDN'T HAVE AN OUNCE OF

1545
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
HATE IN HER.
AND SO WE HAVE TO LIVE THROUGH

1546
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
GRACE AND REALIZE THAT HATE IS

1547
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
NOT HOW OUR FAMILY IS AND

1548
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
CERTAINLY NOT HOW GRACE IS.

1549
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
AND I KNOW ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL

1550
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
LITTLE CHILDREN.

1551
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY HATE IN

1552
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
THEM EITHER.
SO WE'LL JUST TAKE THE LEAD FROM

1553
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
THEM AND WE WILL NOT GO DOWN

1554
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
THAT ROAD.

1555
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
BUT WE'LL LET THEM GUIDE US.

1556
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
>> DURING THE INTERVIEW, WE WERE

1557
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
TALKING ABOUT GRACE.
AND I MENTIONED THAT ONE OF MY

1558
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
FAVORITE SONGS IS "AMAZING

1559
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
GRACE," AND THAT IT ALWAYS MAKES

1560
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
ME CRY.

1561
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I SAID I'LL NEVER HEAR THAT SONG

1562
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
AGAIN WITHOUT THINKING OF THEIR

1563
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
GRACE.
AND LYNN LIKED THAT IDEA.

1564
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
BUT SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

1565
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
WHEN YOU HEAR THAT SONG, YOU

1566
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
SMILE, THAT YOU DON'T CRY.

1567
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
ANOTHER THING THAT LYNN SAID

1568
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
THAT GIVES HER SOME COMFORT TO

1569
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
THINK THAT GRACE DIED WITH HER

1570
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
FRIENDS, AND THAT THEY WERE

1571
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
HOLDING HANDS WHEN THEY DIED.

1572
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
SHE LIKES TO THINK OF THEM ALL

1573
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
IN HEAVEN, ALL 20 OF THOSE

1574
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
