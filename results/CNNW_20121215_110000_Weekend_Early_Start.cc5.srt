THEY HAVE TO.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CONGRESSMAN

IT'S TIME FOR ACTION.

20
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
TIME THAT AMERICA'S POLITICIANS

21

KILLED, SIX ADULTS, ALL AT THE

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000

THE SHOOTER, WHICH WE'RE GOING

73
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000

ALL OF THEM TRYING TO COME TO

83
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
GRIPS WITH THIS HORRIBLE,

84
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.

85
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
>> PEOPLE'S CHILDREN AND
BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE TAKEN

86
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
FROM THEM.

87
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
PEOPLE'S SPOUSES, THOSE TEACHERS

88
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
AND ADMINISTRATORS WERE TAKEN

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
FROM US.

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
YET, WE STAND IN A CHURCH, AND

MANY OF US TODAY IN THE COMING

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
THERE IS FAITH FOR A REASON.

96
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
AND THAT FAITH ITSELF IS GOD'S

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
GIFT.

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
IN THESE TIMES OF TROUBLES WHEN

99
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000

NOT JUST IN THE RELIGIOUS SENSE,

102
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
NOT JUST NECESSARILY OUR FAITH

103
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
IN GOD, BUT OUR FAITH IN

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
COMMUNITY, AND WHO WE ARE AND

105
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
WHAT WE COLLECTIVELY ARE.

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THROUGH THIS MORNING.

118
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
IT IS ALMOST UNIMAGINABLE.

TEACHER WHO SAVED THEM.

203
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
>> YOU THINK THE TEACHER SAVED

204
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
HIS LIFE?
>> HE DID.

205
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
HE HAD BULLETS GOING BY HIM AND

206
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000

THING HE'D EVER SEEN IN HIS

ENTIRE CAREER, BUT IT WAS WHEN

239
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THEY TOLD THE PARENTS.

240
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
ALL OF THESE PARENTS WERE

241
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
WAITING FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO

242
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
COME OUT.
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE, YOU

243
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
KNOW, STILL ALIVE.

244
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
THERE'S 20 PARENTS THAT WERE

245
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
JUST TOLD THAT THEIR CHILDREN

246
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
ARE DEAD.

247
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
IT WAS AWFUL.
>> Reporter: AWFUL.

248
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
AND LATE TODAY SPEAKING FOR THE

249
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
NATION BUT ALSO AS A FATHER, AN

250
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
EMOTIONAL PRESIDENT OBAMA FOUGHT
BACK TEARS.

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
AMERICA WILL DO, WHICH IS HUG

254
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000

256
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
THEM.

257
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
AND WE'LL REMIND EACH OTHER HOW

258
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

259
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

260
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CANNOT DO THAT
TONIGHT.

261
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
AND THEY NEED ALL OF US RIGHT

262
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000

263
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
IN HIS VOICE.

266
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I SIMPLY CAN'T THINK OF AN EVENT

267
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
IN RECENT MEMORY THAT TOUCHED SO

268
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
MANY PEOPLE, SEEMED TO AFFECT

269
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THEM SO DIRECTLY RIGHT IN THEIR

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
HEARTS, RIGHT IN THEIR SOULS.

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
SHOOTING IN NEWTOWN, GO TO

CNN.COM/IMPACTALL.

276
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I WANT TO GO BACK TO ALI VELSHI

277
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
JUST DOWN THE STREET HERE IN

278
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
NEWTOWN.
ALI?

279
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
>> YOU KNOW, JOHN, YOU SEE THOSE

280
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
PARENTS SO EMOTIONALLY

281
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
DISTRAUGHT AND SO MUCH OF THE

282
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
COMMUNITY LIKE THAT AND

283
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
ELSEWHERE IN THE COMMUNITY,

284
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
THERE'S THIS FEELING ABOUT HOW

285
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
STUNNED EVERYBODY IS.

286
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
WHEN YOU TRAVEL AROUND THIS TOWN

287
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
AS I DID LAST NIGHT, JOHN, AS

288
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
YOU SAW, IT'S A BIT OF A SLEEPY

289
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
PLACE, IT'S A QUIET PLACE.

290
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS, I

291
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
UNDERSTAND THERE'S BEEN ONE

292
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
HOMICIDE HERE.

293
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
WE ARE NOW LEARNING A LITTLE BIT

294
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
MORE ABOUT THE MAN WHO POLICE

295
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
SAY WAS THE SHOOTER.

296
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
HE IS 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA.

297
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
LAST NIGHT, OUR PIERS MORGAN GOT

298
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
INSIGHT ON LANZA FROM A FORMER

299
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
CLASSMATE.
>> HE WAS REALLY QUIET, HE KEPT

300
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
TO HIMSELF.

301
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
HE WAS A LITTLE FIDGETY, A

302
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
LITTLE UNEASY SOMETIMES IF YOU

303
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
WERE TO LOOK AT HIM.

304
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I THINK HE WAS JUST SOCIALLY NOT

305
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
REALLY INTO GOING OUT THERE AND

306
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
MAKING AS MANY FRIENDS AS

307
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
EVERYONE ELSE WAS DOING IN

308
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND MIDDLE

309
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
SCHOOL.

310
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
PREFERRED TO STAY TO HIMSELF.

311
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
>> Reporter: ADAM LANZA'S BODY

312
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
WAS FOUND IN THE SCHOOL.

313
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
HIS MOTHER'S BODY WAS FOUND AT

314
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
THE HOME THEY SHARED ABOUT 2 1/2

315
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
MILES FROM HERE.

316
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
THAT IS WHERE OUR MARY SNOW IS

317
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
STANDING BY THIS MORNING.

318
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
MARY, THE AREA THAT YOU ARE IN,

319
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
BIG HOUSES, IT'S A PROSPEROUS

320
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
AREA, A QUIET AREA.

321
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
THERE AREN'T EVEN STREET LIGHTS

322
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
AROUND YOU.

323
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
THE ONLY LIGHTS YOU'VE GOT ARE

324
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
THE ONES PROVIDED BY OUR LIGHTS.

325
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

326
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
AREA'S USED TO.

327
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
WHAT DO WE KNOW NOW ABOUT THE

328
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
AREA AND ADAM LANZA?

329
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
>> YEAH, ALI, WE -- IT'S

330
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
BELIEVED HE DID LIVE WITH HIS

331
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
MOTHER AND THAT HOUSE IS BEHIND

332
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
ME ON THIS QUIET ROAD WHICH IS

333
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
NOW CLOSED OFF BY POLICE, AND,

334
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
OF COURSE, AS YOU SAID, PEOPLE

335
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
ARE ABSOLUTELY STUNNED BY THIS.

336
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT

337
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
HIM, DISTURBED IS ONE WORD A

338
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
NEIGHBOR USED TO DESCRIBE HIM.

339
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
OTHERS DESCRIBED HIM AS

340
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
DIFFERENT, SOCIALLY AWKWARD, AND

341
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
QUIET.
BUT ONE WOMAN WHO CAME BY

342
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
YESTERDAY, SHE'S A FORMER SCHOOL

343
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
BUS DRIVER AND HE WAS ON HER

344
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
ROUTE, SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, HE

345
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
WAS A QUIET KID BUT SHE NEVER

346
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
SAW ANYTHING DANGEROUS, YOU

347
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
KNOW, ABOUT HIM.

348
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
AND A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WE TALKED
TO IN THIS AREA, EVEN THOUGH IT

349
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
IS A VERY CLOSED TIGHT-KNIT

350
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
COMMUNITY, IT'S PHYSICALLY VERY

351
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
LARGE.
AND HOUSES ARE PRETTY SEPARATE

352
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
FROM EACH OTHER AT A GOOD

353
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
DISTANCE.

354
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
AND MANY PEOPLE REALLY WERE NOT

355
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
FAMILIAR WITH THE FAMILY.

356
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
BUT IT'S REALLY KIND OF A MIXED

357
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
PICTURE.
BUT ONE WORD WE DID HERE OFTEN

358
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
WAS VERY QUIET AND DIFFERENT.

359
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
>> MARY, LET'S UNDERSTAND ABOUT

360
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
THE HANDGUNS.

361
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
THERE WERE TWO HANDGUNS USED IN

362
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
THE ATTACK.

363
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
A SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPON FOUND IN

364
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
A CAR NEARBY.

365
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HOW HE GOT

366
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
HIS HANDS ON THOSE GUNS?

367
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
>> Reporter: WELL, OUR OWN SUSAN

368
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
CANDIOTTI HAS BEEN REPORTING

369
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
THAT THOSE HANDGUNS WERE LEGALLY

370
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
PURCHASED AND THEY WERE

371
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
PURCHASED AND REGISTERED TO

372
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
LANZA'S MOTHER NANCY, AND THAT'S

373
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THOSE GUNS.

374
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
>> IT'S A STRICT GUN LAWS IN

375
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
CONNECTICUT.
THEY HAVE TO BE REGISTERED.

376
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
THEY'VE GOT A GUN REGISTRY IN

377
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
THE STATE, WHICH IS WHY THE

378
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
AUTHORITIES, I THINK, WERE ABLE

379
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
TO TRACE THAT BACK SO QUICKLY TO

380
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
THE GUNMAN AND THEORYS AND

387
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
EXPLANATIONS ABOUT HOW SOMETHING

388
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
THIS HORRIBLE COULD'VE HAPPENED.

389
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000

392
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
THE INNOCENCE FROM HUNDREDS AND

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
CERTAINLY OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN

00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
FOR THE FAMILIES HERE.

397

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
POPS, GUN SHOTS.

403
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000

I HAVE NOBODY TO PLAY WITH NOW.
EXCUSE ME.

413
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000

ARE THEY ALL OKAY?

418

AND YOU LOOK AT THEM AND SAY I'M

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
NOT REALLY SURE.

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
THIS KIND OF INCIDENT.

422
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000

470
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
AS YOU MENTIONED, I'M HERE AT

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
DESCRIBED AS THE KIND OF PERSON

479
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
YOU WOULD WANT EDUCATING YOUR

480
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
KIDS, JOHN.
SHE WAS A VERY INVOLVED EDUCATOR

481
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
WITH MEMORABLE ENTHUSIASM

482
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
ACCORDING TO THOSE THAT KNEW

483
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
HER.

484
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
SHE SPENT HER ENTIRE CAREER

485
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
RISING THROUGH THE RANKS OF THE

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
CONNECTICUT SCHOOL SYSTEM,

487
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000

WHERE SHE WAS A FIXTURE IN

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
SCHOOLS BEFORE COMING TO SANDY

489
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000

SCHOOLS, MIDDLE SCHOOLS, AND

492
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
HIGH SCHOOLS.
THOSE WHO REMEMBER HER SAY SHE

493
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT, JOHN,

494
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
THAT MADE PEOPLE FEEL ACCEPTED

495
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
AND IMPORTANT.

496
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
NOT ONLY WAS SHE AN EDUCATOR,

497
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
JOHN, SHE WAS ALSO A MOTHER AND

LEAVES BEHIND TWO DAUGHTERS AND

499
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
MENTIONED, SHE WAS JUST 47 YEARS

501
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000

508
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000

510
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000

551
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
AHEAD OF THEM THAT WILL NEVER BE

552
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
REALIZED.
I WANT TO GO NOW BACK TO ALI

553
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
VELSHI NEAR THE SANDY HOOK

554
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HERE IN

555
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
NEWTOWN.
HEY, ALI.

556
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
>> Reporter: JOHN, YOU KNOW, AS

557
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I SAID WE ARE AT A FIELD, A

558
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
FOOTBALL FIELD, WHICH

559
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
AUTHORITIES SET UP AROUND HERE

560
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
SO THAT THE MEDIA COULD GATHER.

561
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S MEDIA HERE

562
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
FROM ALL OVER THE NORTHEAST, ALL

563
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
OVER THE UNITED STATES, AND, IN

564
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
FACT, FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.

565
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
LAST NIGHT I SAW SOME PEOPLE

566
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
HERE FROM A RUSSIAN TELEVISION

567
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
STATION.
WE'VE GOT SOME CANADIANS NEAR

568
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
US.

569
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
THE SCHOOL IS -- THIS IS A TIGHT

570
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
LITTLE TOWN, JOHN.

571
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
AS YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T HAVE

572
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
SPACE FOR EVERYBODY CONVERGING

573
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
ON IT.

574
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
THE SCHOOL IS BEHIND US SOME

575
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
DISTANCE WHERE ADAM LANZA LIVED

576
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
WAS ABOUT 2 1/2 MILES AWAY.

577
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
AND THIS IS A LITTLE TOWN THAT

578
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED THE

579
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
HORROR THAT UNFOLDED AT SANDY

580
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HERE IN

581
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.
WHAT CAN YOU DO TO KEEP YOUR

582
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
CHILDREN SAFE IF YOU'RE EVER,

583
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
EVER IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION?

584
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
CNN'S BRIAN TODD TALKED TO A

585
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
SCHOOL SECURITY CHIEF.

586
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
>> Reporter: A NIGHTMARE

587
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
SCENARIO FOR ANY SCHOOL SECURITY

588
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
OFFICIAL, BUT MICHAEL BLOW HAS

589
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
SOME IDEAS ON HOW TO AVOID MASS

590
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
CASUALTIES IF A GUNMAN'S INSIDE

591
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
YOUR SCHOOL.
>> HOW DO YOU RESPOND IF THERE

592
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
ARE KIDS ALL AROUND?

593
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
>> WELL, I THINK THAT'S WHERE

594
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
THE TRAINING COMES IN.

595
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
>> Reporter: HE'S HEAD OF

596
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
SECURITY FOR PRINCE GEORGES

597
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN

598
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
MARYLAND.

599
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
A FORMER DEPUTY POLICE CHIEF WHO

600
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
ONCE HAD TO LOCK DOWN A SCHOOL.

601
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
HE TOOK US THROUGH AN ELEMENTARY

602
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
SCHOOL THAT OFFICIALS DIDN'T

603
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
WANT US TO NAME.

604
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
SHOWED US WHAT TO DO IF THAT
NIGHTMARE UNFOLDS.

605
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
>> EXITS ARE OBVIOUSLY KEY,

606
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
RIGHT?
>> YES.
>> FIND THE NEAREST ONE.

607
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
>> ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.

608
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE

609
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
FAMILIAR WITH THE BUILDING.

610
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
THAT'S WHY, AGAIN, WE ENCOURAGE

611
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
JUST LITTLE THINGS.

612
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
A BUILDING FAMILIARIZATION, JUST

613
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
WALKING THE OUTSIDE OF THE

614
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
BUILDING SO YOU KNOW IF YOU

615
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
BELIEVE THIS PARTICULAR DOOR IF

616
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
IT COMES TO A CREEK OR A PARKING

617
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
LOT OR A BUSY INTERSECTION.

618
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
>> Reporter: ADULTS AND

619
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
STUDENTS, HE SAYS, HAVE TO HAVE

620
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
THAT EXIT AWARENESS.

621
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
BUT IF YOU'RE STUCK INSIDE,

622
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
MICHAEL BLOW SAYS WHILE

623
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
BATHROOMS MAY BE A TEMPTING

624
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
PLACE TO HIDE AT FIRST, NOT A

625
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
GOOD IDEA.

626
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
AS YOU CAN SEE, A VERY CONFINED

627
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
SPACE AND USUALLY NO WAY OUT.

628
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
COURTYARDS, HE SAYS, ARE EQUALLY

629
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
TEMPTING BUT ALSO NOT THE BEST

630
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
PLACES BECAUSE THEY'RE OFTEN

631
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
ENCLOSED.

632
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
>> MICHAEL, IF THERE'S A

633
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
CLASSROOM, THERE'S A GUNMAN OUT

634
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
THERE, WE'VE HEARD SHOTS, DON'T

635
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
KNOW WHERE HE IS.

636
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
WHAT DO WE DO?

637
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
WE LOCK, TURN LIGHTS OFF, CLOSE

638
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
WINDOWS?

639
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
>> WELL, CERTAINLY THERE ARE A

640
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
HOST OF THINGS WE WOULD DO IN AN

641
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
EMERGENCY THAT WOULD INCLUDE

642
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
LOCKING DOORS TO MAKE SURE THAT

643
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
WE ARE ABLE TO FORTIFY THAT

644
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
ENTRANCE WAY AS BEST AS WE CAN.

645
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
AGAIN, IF THERE ARE NO SAFE

646
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
ALTERNATIVES FOR EVACUATING THE

647
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
BUILDING AND THAT WAY IF SOMEONE

648
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
WAS TO WALK BY THE ROOM THAT

649
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE AN EASY SIGHT

650
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
PICTURE OF ANYONE IN THE ROOM.

651
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
>> ADULTS IN THE ROOM, HE SAYS,

652
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
SHOULD TALK THE KIDS THROUGH IT

653
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
AS CALMLY AS POSSIBLE.

654
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
>> WHAT ABOUT LARGE ROOMS LIKE

655
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
GYMS?

656
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
>> AGAIN --
>> WOULD YOU GO IN, AVOID IT?

657
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
>> WELL, AGAIN, THERE'S NOT A

658
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
LOT OF PLACES TO CONCEAL

659
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
YOURSELVES AS YOU SEE THERE, BUT

660
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
THERE'S A WAY TO GET TO THE

661
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING.

662
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
>> BLOW DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY

663
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
TOO MANY PREEMPTIVE SCHOOL

664
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
MEASURES, BUT SAYS THEY

665
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
SOMETIMES USE WANDING DEVICES TO

666
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
SCREEN STUDENTS.

667
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
BUT HE SAYS SOME OF THE BEST

668
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
SCREENING IS AWARENESS OF WHO'S

669
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
TROUBLED, WHO'S BEING BULLIED,

670
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
HAVING THAT RADAR UP FOR

671
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
POTENTIAL ASSAILANTS.

672
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
>> OF COURSE, WE KNOW THAT

673
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
DESPITE ANY SCHOOL'S BEST

674
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
EFFORTS, IF SOMEONE IS

675
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
DETERMINED TO CAUSE HARM, THEY

676
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
WILL FIND A WAY AND SADLY THAT'S

677
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AT SANDY

678
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

679
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
JOHN, A COUPLE OF INTERESTING

680
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
THINGS.
DAVID WAS HERE YESTERDAY

681
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
AFTERNOON AND WENT TO THE FIRE

682
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
HOUSE, IT WAS A RENDEZVOUS POINT

683
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
TO MEET UP WITH THEIR KIDS.

684
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
AND HE SAW THEM GOING IN AND IN

685
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
MANY CASES PARENTS CAME OUT WITH

686
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
THEIR KIDS AND HE SAID THE

687
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
REACTION ON THEIR FACES WAS OF

688
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
SUCH RELIEF BUT STRAIN AND

689
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
STRESS AND THEN THERE WERE THOSE

690
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
PARENTS WHO WENT THERE EXPECTING

691
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
TO FIND THEIR KIDS AND LEFT

692
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
WITHOUT THEM.

693
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
THEY STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THEIR

694
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
KIDS.

695
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
THE BODIES WERE STILL BEING

696
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
PROCESSED LAST NIGHT.

697
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
POLICE WANTED TO GET TENTATIVE

698
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
IDENTIFICATIONS ON ALL OF THE

699
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
BODIES BEFORE THEY WERE ABLE TO

700
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
RELEASE THAT INFORMATION TO

701
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
THEIR PARENTS.
AND OF COURSE, WE WILL HEAR

702
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
ABOUT THAT THIS MORNING PROBABLY

703
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS.

704
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
POLICE ARE EXPECTING TO UPDATE

705
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
US AT ABOUT 8:00 EASTERN TIME.

706
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
JOHN, THE OTHER THING LET'S TALK

707
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
ABOUT.
YOU WERE IN HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY,

708
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
LAST NIGHT, WHICH FOR A WHILE

709
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
WAS TREATED AS THE SCENE OF A

710
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
CRIME.
TELL US WHAT WAS GOING ON IN

711
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
HOBOKEN.
>> Reporter: YOU KNOW, ALI, IT

712
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
WAS SO INTERESTING, FOR MUCH OF

713
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
YESTERDAY, HOBOKEN, THE STREET

714
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
WAS ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY.

715
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
HOBOKEN CITY POLICE, JERSEY CITY

716
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
POLICE, BOMB SQUAD

717
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
REPRESENTATIVES AND THE FBI.

718
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
THE REASON WAS THEY WERE GOING

719
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
INTO THE APARTMENT OF RYAN LANZA

720
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
WHO IS THE BROTHER OF THE

721
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
SHOOTER, THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER

722
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
ADAM LANZA.

723
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
APPARENTLY ADAM HAD HIS

724
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
BROTHER'S I.D. ON HIM WHEN HE

725
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
WENT INTO THE SCHOOL AND

726
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
CONDUCTED THE SHOOTING.

727
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
SO AUTHORITIES WENT RIGHT TO

728
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
RYAN'S APARTMENT IN HOBOKEN,

729
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
TOOK HIM INTO CUSTODY BRIEFLY

730
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
FOR QUESTIONING ALSO QUESTIONED

731
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
SOME FRIENDS WHO MAY HAVE LIVED

732
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
WITH HIM THERE.
IT WAS JUST A CONFUSING

733
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000

918
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
THIS FAMILY.
AND WHAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING

919
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
FROM FORMER CLASSMATES IS THAT

920
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
ADAM LANZA WAS DESCRIBED AS A

921
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
STUDENT WHO WAS VERY BRIGHT,

922
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
VERY QUIET, SOME OF THE

923
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
DESCRIPTIONS ABOUT HIM WERE

924
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
SOCIALLY AWKWARD.

925
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
YESTERDAY, THERE WAS A WOMAN WHO

926
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
SAID SHE WAS A FORMER BUS DRIVER

927
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
AND KNEW HIM WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER

928
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
AND SHE SAID THAT THERE WAS

929
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
NOTHING ABOUT HIM THAT REALLY
STOOD OUT.

930
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

931
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
>> HE WAS A NICE KID.

932
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
VERY POLITE.
SHE RAISED VERY NICE BOYS, TO

933
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
ME.

934
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S A SHOCK.

935
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
TO EVEN KNOW THEM AND REALIZE

936
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT HE DID.

937
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT

938
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
HAPPENED THAT HE -- THAT HE

939
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
SNAPPED WHAT HAVE YOU AND TOOK

940
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
SUCH INNOCENT LIVES.

941
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
>> AND SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS WHO

942
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
KNEW HIM IN RECENT YEARS, SOME

943
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
DESCRIBED HIM AS BEING

944
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
DIFFERENT.
ONE NEIGHBOR USED THE WORD

945
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
TROUBLED TO DESCRIBE HIM, BUT

946
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
WOULDN'T REALLY ELABORATE ON

947
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
THAT.

948
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
JOHN?
>> MARY, THREE GUNS, WE

949
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
UNDERSTAND, AT THE SCENE.

950
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
TWO HANDGUNS, A CIG SIEOR, A

951
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
GLOCK.

952
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHERE THE

953
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
SHOOTER GOT THESE WEAPONS?

954
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
>> YEAH, AND VERY STRICT LAWS

955
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
HERE IN CONNECTICUT.

956
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
AND WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM

957
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
OUR OWN SUSAN CANDIOTTI'S

958
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
REPORTING IS THAT THESE GUNS

959
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
WERE LEGALLY PURCHASED AND

960
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
PURCHASED IN THE NAME OF NANCY

961
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
LANZA, THE SUSPECT'S MOTHER.

962
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
>> Reporter: NANCY LANZA FOR

963
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
MUCH OF THE DAY YESTERDAY,

964
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REPORTING SHE

965
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
WORKED AT THE SCHOOL.

966
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
THERE APPEAR TO BE QUESTIONS

967
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
ABOUT THAT.
WHAT MORE HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT

968
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
HER LIFESTYLE, ANYTHING FROM THE

969
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
NEIGHBORS WHO MAY KNOW HER?

970
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
>> YEAH, AND YOU KNOW, JOHN, AS

971
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
YOU SAID, THIS IS A TIGHT-KNIT

972
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
COMMUNITY AND SO MANY OF THE

973
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
PEOPLE HERE HAVE SENT THEIR

974
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
CHILDREN TO SANDY HOOK

975
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
AND WE COULD FIND NO ONE WHO

976
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
COULD PLACE HER AT THE SCHOOL OR

977
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
SAY THAT THERE WAS A DEFINITIVE

978
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
LINK.

979
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
WE DID MEET ONE NEIGHBOR WHO HAD

980
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
KNOWN HER IN THE PAST,

981
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
DESCRIBING HER AS A GOOD MOTHER.

982
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
SHE WAS -- HER BELIEF THAT SHE

983
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
WAS A STAY-AT-HOME MOM AND WAS

984
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
UNAWARE OF ANY JOBS THAT SHE

985
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
HELD.
SO IT'S REALLY UNCLEAR ABOUT,

986
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
YOU KNOW, HER PROFESSION OR IF

987
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
THERE WAS ANY LINK TO THE

988
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
SCHOOL.

989
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
>> MARY SNOW, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

990
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
YOU'VE BEEN HERE SINCE EARLY

991
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
YESTERDAY WORKING ON THIS STORY.

992
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
IT'S HARD FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED.

993
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
THANKS, MARY.

994
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
ALI?

995
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
>> JOHN, MARY WAS AT THAT CHURCH

996
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
YOU'RE AT NOW.

997
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
ONE OF THE SEVERAL VIGILS THAT

998
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
TOOK PLACE AROUND HERE.

999
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
IT'S SUCH A SMALL TOWN.

1000
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
AND YET THERE ARE SO MANY POINTS

1001
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
OF CONCENTRATION AROUND HERE.

1002
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
IN FACT, AS YOU PLAYED THAT TAPE

1003
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
OF THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN

1004
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
FIRST RESPONDERS YESTERDAY, YOU

1005
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
TALKED ABOUT THEM, THEY TALKED

1006
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
ABOUT A STAGING AREA.

1007
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DID EARLY

1008
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
BECAUSE THIS IS A SMALL TOWN

1009
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
WITH SMALL STREETS, NARROW

1010
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
STREETS THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE THE

1011
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
INFLUX OF MEDIA THAT HAVE COME

1012
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
IN TO COVER IT.

1013
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
THEY PUT US ALL AT A PARK, TREAD

1014
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
WELL PARK, IT'S FOOTBALL

1015
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
FIELD -- SOCCER FIELD IN FRONT

1016
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
OF ME RIGHT NOW.

1017
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
THE SCHOOL IS BEHIND US AND THIS

1018
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
IS A SPACE WHERE EVERYBODY'S

1019
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
CONVERGED.
JUST BESIDE ME IN ABOUT AN HOUR,

1020
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
THEY'LL HOLD THE NEWS

1021
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
CONFERENCES.

1022
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
THEY WERE HOLDING THEM ELSEWHERE

1023
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
TODAY AND THEY DECIDED THIS IS

1024
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
WHERE EVERYBODY IS AND THIS IS

1025
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO START

1026
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
LETTING EVERYBODY KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON.

1027
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
WHAT WE ARE EXPECTING AT 8:00

1028
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
EASTERN IS THE RELEASE OF SOME

1029
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
NAMES.

1030
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING IT'S ADAM

1031
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
LANZA, THE SHOOTER, BUT POLICE

1032
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
HAVE NOT OFFERED THAT

1033
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
IDENTIFICATION AS OF YET.

1034
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
THEY WANT POSITIVE

1035
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
IDENTIFICATIONS ON THE SHOOTER

1036
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
AND THE VICTIMS.

1037
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
SO THEY'LL BE BRINGING THAT TO
US.

1038
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
WE EXPECT AT 8:00 OR SOME TIME

1039
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
THEREAFTER.

1040
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
REMEMBER, THERE WERE 18 CHILDREN

1041
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
SHOT IN THE SCHOOL, SIX ADULTS,

1042
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
TWO OF THE CHILDREN DIED AT THE

1043
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
HOSPITAL.

1044
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
ONE PERSON REMAINS WOUNDED AND

1045
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
IN THE HOSPITAL.

1046
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
NOW IT'S BEEN OVER 21 HOURS

1047
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
SINCE THIS UNIMAGINABLE

1048
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
NIGHTMARE HAPPENED HERE IN

1049
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
NEWTOWN.

1050
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
ALL STARTED WHEN A GUNMAN

1051
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
ENTERED THROUGH THE DOORS OF

1052
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1053
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
TOM FOREMAN WALKS US THROUGH

1054
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
WHAT HAPPENED MINUTE BY MINUTE.

1055
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
>> THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS

1056
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
POINT ABOUT THE TIME LINE OF THE

1057
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
SHOOTING AS REPORTED BY LAW

1058
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND

1059
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
WITNESSES.
AND THE LAYOUT OF THE SCHOOL AS

1060
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
BEST WE CAN PIECE IT ALL

1061
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
TOGETHER.

1062
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
9:30 IN THE MORNING, CLASSES

1063
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
UNDERWAY FOR HALF AN HOUR.

1064
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
MORE THAN 600 STUDENTS AND ABOUT

1065
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
50 FACULTY MEMBERS ARE INSIDE

1066
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
THE BUILDING.

1067
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
IN ADDITION TO THAT, A MEETING

1068
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
CONVENED BY SOME SCHOOL

1069
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THE

1070
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
PRINCIPAL -- ABOUT SEVEN OF THEM

1071
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
GATHERED IN ONE ROOM.

1072
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
ABOUT 9:40, TEN MINUTES LATER AS

1073
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
BEST WE CAN MAKE IT OUT AGAIN,

1074
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
THAT'S WHEN THE GUNMAN APPEARS

1075
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
TO HAVE ENTERED THE BUILDING.

1076
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
HOW?
WE DON'T KNOW, THEY HAD A NEW

1077
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
SECURITY SYSTEM THAT MIGHT HAVE

1078
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
KEPT HIM OUT.

1079
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED WITH

1080
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
THAT.
POLICE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

1081
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
LOOKING AT A CAR PARKED RIGHT

1082
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
OUT HERE IN THE FIRE LANE

1083
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
SUGGESTING THAT IF THAT WERE HIS
CAR THAT, IN FACT, HE MAY HAVE

1084
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
INDEED COME RIGHT THROUGH THE

1085
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
FRONT DOOR HERE INTO THE SCHOOL.

1086
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING

1087
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
AT THAT POINT START SAYING THAT

1088
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
THEY'RE HEARING SHOTS.

1089
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
9:41, THE CALLS START GOING IN

1090
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
TO 911 AT THAT POINT.

1091
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
AND THE PRINCIPAL, THE VICE

1092
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
PRINCIPAL, AND THE SCHOOL

1093
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
PSYCHOLOGIST ALL GO TOWARD THE

1094
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
GUNFIRE OUT IN THE HALLWAY

1095
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
ACCORDING TO A WITNESS.

1096
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
ONLY THE VICE PRINCIPAL RETURNS,

1097
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
AND THE VICE PRINCIPAL IS

1098
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
WOUNDED.
THERE ARE MANY, MANY SHOTS OUT

1099
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
THERE.
EVERYONE SAYS THEY HEAR IT.

1100
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
AUTHORITIES SAY THE SHOOTING

1101
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
ITSELF HAPPENED IN A RELATIVELY

1102
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, AND THEY

1103
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
SAY THE GUNMAN GENERALLY STAYS

1104
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
IN THIS AREA.

1105
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
IN FACT, THEY SAY ALL THE

1106
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
SHOOTING HAPPENS IN TWO ROOMS.

1107
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
9:45, TEACHERS THROUGHOUT THIS

1108
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
BUILDING ARE TRYING TO PROTECT

1109
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
STUDENTS, IN SOME CASES THE

1110
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
STUDENTS SAY THEY HELPED THEM

1111
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
HIDE, IN OTHERS THERE SEEMS TO

1112
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
BE SOME INDICATION THAT TEACHERS

1113
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
MAY HAVE TRIED TO GET THEM OUT

1114
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
OF THE BUILDING.

1115
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THOUGH, YOU

1116
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
SEE THE PICTURES OF THE NEWTOWN

1117
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
BEE, THERE WAS AN EFFORT TO GET

1118
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
THE STUDENTS OUT TO SAFETY.

1119
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
AND IT WAS A DIFFICULT STUNT TO

1120
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
PULL OFF BECAUSE YOU HAVE

1121
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
HUNDREDS OF KIDS HERE AND

1122
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY TRAUMATIZED

1123
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
AND VERY, VERY UPSET.

1124
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
9:50.

1125
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
BY THIS TIME FOR SURE, AND

1126
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
AGAIN, WE'RE NOT SURE OF THE

1127
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
TIME LINE, IT'S MURKY, BUT THE

1128
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
GUNMAN SOMEWHERE IN THIS PROCESS

1129
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
HAS DIED.

1130
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
POLICE OFFICERS SAY NO OFFICER

1131
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
FIRED A SHOT.
SO IT'S BELIEVED HE SHOT

1132
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
HIMSELF, BUT THIS WE DO KNOW.

1133
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
AS OFFICERS ARRIVE ON THE SCENE

1134
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
FROM STATE AND LOCAL POLICE,

1135
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
THEY SECURE THE ENTIRE BUILDING

1136
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
AND THEY SPREAD OUT THROUGH IT

1137
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO

1138
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
OTHER GUNMEN AND TRYING TO FIND

1139
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
ALL THESE POCKETS OF CHILDREN

1140
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
HIDING WITHIN THIS BUILDING.

1141
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
AND AT THAT POINT, THEY START

1142
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
ESCORTING THEM OUT OF THE

1143
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
BUILDING AS WELL.
A DIFFICULT, DIFFICULT TIME, AND

1144
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
THIS TIME LINE IS WHAT THE

1145
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE GOING TO HAVE

1146
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
TO BUILD UPON IN THE COMING

1147
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
WEEKS TO CLARIFY, TO MAKE SURE

1148
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
WE KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THINGS

1149
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
HAPPENED AND HOW.

1150
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
>> Reporter: AND THAT IS TOM

1151
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
FOREMAN REPORTING FOR CNN.

1152
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
IN THE AFTERMATH OF FRIDAY'S

1153
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
TRAGEDY, QUESTIONS ARE BEING

1154
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
FORMED AROUND THE GUNS THAT WERE

1155
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
USED.
THREE WEAPONS WERE RECOVERED

1156
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
FROM THE SCENE.

1157
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
SIMILAR TO THE ONES WE'RE ABOUT

1158
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
TO SHOW YOU.
THEY INCLUDE TWO PISTOLS, A

1159
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
GLOCK AND A SIG SIEOR.

1160
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
A BUSH MASTER RIFLE.

1161
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
ALL THREE GUNS WERE LEGALLY

1162
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
PURCHASED BY THE SHOOTER'S
MOTHER.

1163
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
LET'S DISCUSS THIS A LITTLE

1164
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
MORE.

1165
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
WE'RE JOINED BY TOM FUENTES.

1166
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
TOM, LET'S START WITH YOU.

1167
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
THE BUSH MASTER WAS REGISTERED

1168
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
TO THE SUSPECT'S MOTHER, NANCY

1169
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
LANZ, A SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPON IN

1170
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
A STATE THAT IS CALLED A MAY

1171
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
ISSUE STATE.
IT'S NOT THE EASIEST PLACE TO

1172
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
GET A GUN.

1173
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
PARTICULARLY A SEMIAUTOMATIC

1174
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
GUN.
EXPLAIN WHY WE THINK NANCY LANZA

1175
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
HAD A BUSH MASTER AND WAS ABLE

1176
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
TO GET ONE.

1177
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
>> GOOD MORNING, ALI.

1178
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I THINK RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO

1179
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
CLUE WHY SHE WOULD'VE GOTTEN

1180
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
THOSE WEAPONS.

1181
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
SHE MAY HAVE BEEN IN FEAR OF

1182
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
BEING BURGLARIZED OR ROBBED OR

1183
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
SOMEBODY ELSE HAPPENING.

1184
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
MAYBE SHE HAD BEEN THREATENED,

1185
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
YOU KNOW, ONCE BEFORE IN HER

1186
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
LIFE AND FELT LIKE SHE WANTED

1187
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
WEAPONS IN THE HOUSE TO PROTECT

1188
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
HERSELF.

1189
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
BUT, THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE AN

1190
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
EASY ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION

1191
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
UNLESS SHE TOLD A FRIEND OR

1192
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
RELATIVE WHY SHE WANTED TO HAVE
THOSE THREE WEAPONS.

1193
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
>> YOU KNOW, LET ME FOLLOW UP,

1194
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
TOM.
HOW HARD IS IT TO GET A BUSH

1195
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
MASTER RIFLE?

1196
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
AND IF I CAN ASK ABOUT THE

1197
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
PISTOLS FOR A SECOND, WHAT ARE

1198
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THEM?

1199
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
ARE THEY POSSIBLE TO LOAD WITH

1200
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
THESE HIGH NUMBER OF ROUND

1201
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
MAGAZINES WITH A LOT OF BULLETS?

1202
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
>> YES, THEY'RE POSSIBLE TO DO

1203
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
THAT.

1204
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
THE STANDARD MAGAZINE WOULD

1205
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
GENERALLY ENABLE THAT GUN TO

1206
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
HAVE ABOUT 15 BULLETS IN IT.

1207
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
EACH OF THE TWO GUNS, ABOUT 15

1208
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
BULLETS A PIECE, BUT YOU CAN BUY

1209
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
EXTENDED MAGAZINES THAT CARRY 30

1210
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
ROUNDS LIKE WE SAW IN THE TUCSON

1211
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
SHOOTING A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

1212
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE.

1213
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD THAT IN

1214
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
THIS CASE OR IF HE JUST RELOADED

1215
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
AND HAD MULTIPLE MAGAZINES AND

1216
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
RELOADED AS HE RAN OUT.

1217
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
BECAUSE WE THINK HE SHOT MORE

1218
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
THAN 30 ROUNDS FROM THE TWO

1219
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
PISTOLS.

1220
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
>> TOM, THESE PISTOLS ARE

1221
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
COMMON.

1222
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
THEY ARE ACTUALLY COMMONLY USED

1223
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
BY POLICE, PARTICULARLY THAT

1224
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
GLOCK.

1225
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
BUSH MASTER BIT MORE OF AN

1226
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
UNUSUAL WEAPON.

1227
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
BUT IF CIVILIANS ARE GOING TO

1228
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
GET PISTOLS, THESE ARE THE TWO

1229
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
MORE COMMON ONES AROUND.

1230
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
>> WELL, IN SENSE, THEY'RE NOT

1231
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
AS COMMON BECAUSE OF THE FACT

1232
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
THEY'RE HIGH-QUALITY GUNS THAT
ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE

1233
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
AVERAGE PISTOLE.

1234
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
OBVIOUSLY PROFESSIONAL LAW

1235
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WOULD WANT

1236
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
TO HAVE A QUALITY PISTOL SUCH AS

1237
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
A GLOCK OR SIG SAUER.

1238
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
THESE ARE QUALITY WEAPONS, YOU

1239
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
KNOW, AS WE'VE SEEN,

1240
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN BROUGHT TO A

1241
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
BAD PURPOSE.

1242
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
AS FAR AS THE BUSH MASTER,

1243
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
AGAIN, THESE GUNS ARE LEGAL.

1244
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
ANY RESTRICTIONS ON ASSAULT

1245
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
RIFLES THAT HAD BEEN IN PLACE

1246
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
HAVE EXPIRED OR NOT RENEWED BY

1247
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
THE CONGRESS.

1248
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
SO PRETTY MUCH ANYBODY CAN GO IF

1249
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
THEY MEET THE GUN CHECKS CAN GO

1250
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
AHEAD AND PURCHASE THIS.

1251
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
AND IN THIS SITUATION, NO MATTER

1252
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
HOW MENTALLY ILL THE SHOOTER MAY

1253
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
HAVE BEEN, THERE'S NO INDICATION

1254
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
THAT HIS MOTHER WAS OR THAT SHE

1255
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
HAD ANY TROUBLE PURCHASING THE

1256
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
WEAPONS, REGISTERING THE

1257
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
WEAPONS, OR HAVING THEM.

1258
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
YOU STILL HAVE THE ISSUE OF A

1259
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
MENTALLY DISTURBED PERSON IN A

1260
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
HOME WHERE THE HOMEOWNER IN THIS

1261
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
CASE THE MOTHER LEGALLY OWNS

1262
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
WEAPONS.

1263
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
>> AND WE'RE STILL WAITING TO

1264
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
FIND OUT IF, IN FACT, THERE'S --

1265
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
SORRY, JOHN, GO AHEAD.

1266
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
>> NO, I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY

1267
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
YOU MENTIONED BEFORE THE NUMBER
OF SHOTS FIRED.

1268
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
WE BELIEVE WE HEAR FROM

1269
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
WITNESSES THEY HEARD AT LEAST

1270
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
100 ROUNDS GO OFF IN THE

1271
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
HALLWAY.
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF

1272
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
BULLETS THESE COULD HOLD THE 30

1273
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
MAGAZINES IF THEY HAD EXTENDED

1274
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
CLIPS.
HOW HARD WOULD IT BE TO GET OFF

1275
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
100 ROUNDS IN THIS TYPE OF

1276
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
EVENT?
>> AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN PULL

1277
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
THE TRIGGER AND RELOAD

1278
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
MAGAZINES.
WHEN SOMEBODY RUNS OUT OF

1279
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
AMMUNITION, WHICH DOESN'T OFTEN

1280
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
HAPPEN IN THE MOVIES, BUT WHEN

1281
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
THAT HAPPENS AND THEY RELOAD THE

1282
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
MAGAZINE, ONE OF THE VICTIMS MAY

1283
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
POUNCE ON THE SHOOTER AND ATTACK

1284
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
HIM AT THAT POINT WHEN HE'S

1285
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
VULNERABLE.
BUT HERE WE'RE TALKING 5 AND

1286
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
6-YEAR-OLDS.

1287
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
SO EVEN IF HE STOPS FOR TWO

1288
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
SECONDS TO SWITCH MAGAZINES AND

1289
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
PUT A FRESH MAGAZINE IN THE GUN

1290
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
TO KEEP GOING, THE LITTLE KIDS

1291
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
AREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP

1292
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
HIM.

1293
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
SO THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT

1294
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
SITUATION THAN WE HAVE IF IT

1295
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
OCCURRED ON A CITY STREET CORNER

1296
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
OR EVEN WITH ADULTS.

1297
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
>> TOM, IN CONNECTICUT, AS WE

1298
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
SAID, THIS IS A -- IT'S CALLED A

1299
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
MAY ISSUE STATE.

1300
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
WHICH MEANS IF YOU FULFILL THE

1301
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
REQUIREMENTS REQUIRED TO GET A

1302
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
GUN, THEY HAVE OTHER THINGS THEY

1303
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
CAN DO TO DETERMINE WHETHER

1304
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
SOMEONE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT

1305
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
HAVE ACCESS TO A GUN.

1306
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

1307
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IN THIS CASE,

1308
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
IF THE MOTHER HAS NEVER BEEN

1309
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
ARRESTED OR JUDGED MENTALLY ILL

1310
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
AND SHE WANTS TO PURCHASE A

1311
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
WEAPON, SHE GOES THROUGH THE

1312
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
PROCEDURES IN PLACE IN THE STATE

1313
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
OF CONNECTICUT, WHICH ARE

1314
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
REPORTEDLY MORE STRINGENT THAN

1315
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
MANY OF THE OTHER STATES WHERE

1316
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
THESE TYPE OF SHOOTINGS HAVE

1317
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
OCCURRED.

1318
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
BUT IF SHE'S IN A POSITION TO GO

1319
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
AHEAD AND BUY THAT WEAPON OR

1320
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
THREE WEAPONS LEGALLY, YOU KNOW,

1321
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
IT DOESN'T -- THAT DOESN'T SOLVE

1322
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
THE PROBLEM.
SHE'S GOT THE GUNS THAT ARE IN

1323
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
THE HOUSE, YOU KNOW, IT JUST

1324
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
TOOK HER SON TO STEAL THEM FROM

1325
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
HER AND TURN THEM ON HER AND GO
FORWARD.

1326
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
>> TOM, THANKS FOR YOUR INPUT

1327
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
INTO THIS, FORMER ASSISTANT FBI

1328
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
DIRECTOR JOINING US NOW.

1329
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
IN WASHINGTON, A VISIBLY

1330
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
EMOTIONAL AND TEARFUL PRESIDENT

1331
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
OBAMA ADDRESSED THE NATION

1332
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.
HE OFFERED PRAYERS, SOLACE AND

1333
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
SUPPORT FOR THE VICTIMS IN THIS

1334
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
TRAGEDY.
>> WE'VE ENDURED TOO MANY OF

1335
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
THESE TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST FEW

1336
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
YEARS.

1337
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I KNOW THERE'S NOT A PARENT IN

1338
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

1339
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I
DO.

1340
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

1341
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

1342
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

1343
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

1344
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

1345
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

1346
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

1347
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

1348
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
TEACHERS, MEN AND WOMEN WHO

1349
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING

1350
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
OUR CHILDREN FULFILL THEIR

1351
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
DREAMS.

1352
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

1353
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
PARENTS OF THE SURVIVORS, AS

1354
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
WELL.
FOR AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE TO

1355
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

1356
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
TONIGHT, THEY KNOW THEIR

1357
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN

1358
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY

1359
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
AND THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT WILL

1360
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
EASE THEIR PAIN.

1361
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
THIS EVENING, MICHELLE AND I

1362
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
WILL DO I KNOW WHAT EVERY PARENT

1363
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
IN AMERICA WILL DO WHICH IS HUG

1364
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
OUR CHILDREN A LITTLE TIGHTER

1365
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
AND TELL THEM WE LOVE THEM.

1366
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
AND WE'LL REMIND EACH OTHER HOW

1367
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

1368
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

1369
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CANNOT DO THAT

1370
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
TONIGHT.
MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF THE

1371
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
VICTIMS.

1372
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
AND IN THE WORDS OF SCRIPTURE,

1373
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
HEAL THE BROKEN HEARTED AND BIND

1374
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
UP THEIR WOUNDS.

1375
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
[ sniffs ] I HAVE A COLD.

1376
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
[ sniffs ] I TOOK DAYQUIL
BUT MY NOSE IS STILL RUNNY.

1377
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
[ Male Announcer ] TRUTH IS,
DAYQUIL DOESN'T TREAT THAT.

1378
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
REALLY?
[ Male Announcer ]
Alka-Seltzer Plus

COLD SYMPTOMS,

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000

[ Male Announcer ]
YES, IT IS.

1383
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
THAT'S THE COLD TRUTH!

1384
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I HEARD YOU GUYS CAN SHIP GROUND
FOR LESS THAN THE UPS STORE.

1385
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
THAT'S RIGHT.

1386
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I'VE LEARNED THE ONLY WAY TO GET
A HOLIDAY DEAL IS TO CAMP OUT.

1387
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN OPEN
ALL NIGHT.

1388
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
IS THIS A TRICK
TO GET MY SPOT?

1389
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000

BREAK FROM THE HOLIDAY STRESS.

SCHOOL YESTERDAY.
AND LET ME START OFF BY SAYING,

1435
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
FIRST OF ALL, OUR THOUGHTS ARE

00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
WITH YOU AND THIS ENTIRE TOWN,

1437
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
WHAT YOU'RE ALL GOING THROUGH

RIGHT NOW.
LET ME ASK YOU, HOW ARE YOU?

1439
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
AND HOW'S YOUR DAUGHTER?

1440
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
>> MY DAUGHTER IS DOING

1441
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
SURPRISINGLY WELL.

1442
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
SHE'S DOING SURPRISINGLY WELL

1443
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
AFTER WHAT SHE SAW.

1444
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
>> HOW DID THIS GO DOWN FOR YOU

1445
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
YESTERDAY?
WHEN DID YOU FIRST GET WORD THAT

1446
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
SOMETHING HORRIBLE WAS HAPPENING

1447
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
AT THE SCHOOL?

1448
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU?

1449
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
AND WHAT DID THEY ASK YOU TO DO?

1450
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
>> I WORKED ABOUT AN HOUR PLUS

1451
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
AWAY AND MY WIFE CALLED ME AND

1452
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
SAID THERE'D BEEN A SHOOTING.

1453
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
SHE HAD ALREADY RUSHED TO THE

1454
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
SCHOOL TO GET MY DAUGHTER WHO

1455
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
HAD MADE THEIR WAY TO THE FIRE
HOUSE.

1456
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I WAS ABLE TO GET TO THE FIRE

1457
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
HOUSE EVENTUALLY AND AT THAT

1458
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
TIME, IT WAS JUST TOO EARLY.

1459
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
WE HAD NO IDEA ABOUT ALL THE

1460
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
CHILDREN AND THE FACULTY WHO HAD

1461
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
DIED.

1462
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
>> YOU KNEW YOUR DAUGHTER WAS

1463
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
OKAY, THOUGH, CORRECT?

1464
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
>> THANK GOD.

1465
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
WE KNEW SHE WAS OKAY AND, YOU

1466
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
KNOW, JUST GAVE HER A BIG HUG.

1467
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
YOU KNOW, AND JUST GOT HER OUT

1468
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
OF THERE.

1469
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
>> AND SO MANY PARENTS ACROSS

1470
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
THE COUNTRY INCLUDING ME,

1471
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
FRANKLY, WANT TO KNOW HOW TO

1472
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
TALK TO OUR KIDS ABOUT THIS.

1473
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
OUR KIDS, OF COURSE, DIDN'T GO

1474
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
THROUGH THIS.

1475
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
HAS YOUR DAUGHTER ASKED YOU ANY

1476
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

1477
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
>> WELL, THAT'S A VERY DIFFICULT

1478
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
QUESTION.

1479
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
AND, YOU KNOW, VERY -- THIS IS

1480
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
ALL NEW.
SO ALL WE REALLY CAN DO, I

1481
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
THINK, IS THE BEST THING IS TO

1482
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
BE HONEST AND LET HER KNOW WHAT

1483
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
WE KNOW.
TRY TO TALK TO THEM AND TRY TO

1484
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
REINFORCE THE BAD GUY THAT DID

1485
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
THIS IS GONE FOREVER.

1486
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
BECAUSE, OF COURSE, ALL THEY'RE

1487
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
TALKING ABOUT IS NOT WANTING TO

1488
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
GO TO SCHOOL AGAIN.

1489
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
BOTH MY CHILDREN.

1490
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I HAVE A 10-YEAR-OLD WHO WAS IN

1491
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
ANOTHER SCHOOL ON LOCKDOWN, AS

1492
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
WELL.

1493
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
AND THEY'RE JUST REALLY, REALLY

1494
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
FREAKED OUT.

1495
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.

1496
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1497
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
THEY'RE TALKING TO YOU, THEY

1498
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL

1499
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
AGAIN.

1500
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
DID YOUR DAUGHTER TELL YOU

1501
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE

1502
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
TO BE IN THE SCHOOL AS THIS WAS

1503
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
HAPPENING?

1504
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
>> SHE WAS IN A READING CLASS,

1505
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
AND IT WAS A SEPARATED CLASS

1506
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
WITH JUST -- USUALLY THERE'S

1507
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
JUST A FEW KIDS IN THERE.

1508
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
AND SHE HEARD A BUNCH OF

1509
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
BANGING, SOUNDED LIKE HAMMERING

1510
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
SHE SAID.

1511
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
AND HER TEACHER, HER READING

1512
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
TEACHER GRABBED MY DAUGHT AS

1513
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
WELL AS A FELLOW TEACHER THAT

1514
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
WAS IN THE READING ROOM AND

1515
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
ACTUALLY LOCKED THEM IN THE

1516
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
BATHROOM AND THEY JUST HEARD

1517
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
LOTS OF SHOTS AND I THINK MY

1518
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
DAUGHTER SAID SHE HEARD

1519
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
SCREAMING.
AND EVENTUALLY THE POLICE WERE

1520
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
BANGING ON THE DOOR AND WERE

1521
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
ABLE TO ESCORT THEM INTO THE

1522
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
HALLWAY, GET THEM OUT TOWARDS,

1523
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
UNFORTUNATELY, WHERE FROM WHAT I

1524
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
UNDERSTAND WHERE MOST OF THE

1525
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
SHOOTINGS HAPPENED, WHICH WAS A

1526
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
PRETTY ROUGH SCENE FROM WHAT I

1527
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
UNDERSTAND FROM WHAT MY DAUGHTER

1528
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
TOLD ME.

1529
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
AND THEN THEY WERE ABLE TO WHISK

1530
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
THEM AWAY TO THE FIRE HOUSE.

1531
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
AND I BELIEVE MY DAUGHTER, FROM

1532
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
WHAT SHE TELLS ME WAS THE FIR

1533
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
FIRST -- THE FIRST KID TO GET TO

1534
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
THE FIRE HOUSE.

1535
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
>> THIS IS SOMETHING NO KID

1536
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
SHOULD EVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH,

1537
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
DECLAN, I THINK THAT GOES

1538
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
WITHOUT SAYING.

1539
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
WHAT KIND OF COMMUNICATION ARE

1540
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
YOU GETTING FROM THE TOWN, FROM
THE AUTHORITIES?

1541
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
>> YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TO BE

1542
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
FRANK WITH YOU, SINCE THIS

1543
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
HAPPENED, YOU KNOW, THE PHONE'S

1544
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
BEEN RINGING OFF THE HOOK.

1545
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE WANTING TO

1546
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

1547
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
SO THERE'S JUST BEEN -- WE

1548
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
ACTUALLY TURNED OUR PHONES OFF

1549
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
YESTERDAY.

1550
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
LAST NIGHT, AND WE'VE BEEN JUST

1551
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
GETTING OUR SOURCES FROM THE

1552
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
NEWS.
WE HAVEN'T LET OUR KIDS WATCH

1553
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
THE NEWS YET.

1554
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE RIGHT

1555
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
OR WRONG DECISION, BUT I THINK

1556
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
IT'S BEST THAT WE TALK WITH THEM

1557
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
FIRST AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET

1558
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
PLENTY OF THAT STUFF LATER.

1559
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
AND SO, YOU KNOW, NEWS SOURCES

1560
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
LIKE YOURS IS WHERE WE'RE

1561
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
GETTING OUR UPDATES.

1562
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
>> DECLAN, WE SINCERELY

1563
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
APPRECIATE YOU TALKING TO US

1564
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
THIS MORNING.

1565
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR THE

1566
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
WEEKEND AT THIS POINT?

1567
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
HOW DO YOU -- HOW DO YOU SPEND

1568
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,000
THE NEXT TWO DAYS?

1569
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
>> I HONESTLY HAVEN'T EVEN

1570
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

1571
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
THIS IS SO NEW.

1572
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
MOST OF MY DAY YESTERDAY WAS

1573
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
JUST SPENT -- YOU KNOW, WE

1574
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
GOT -- IT WASN'T THAT EASY TO

1575
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
GET OUT OF THE AREA.

1576
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
THERE WERE LOTS OF EMERGENCY

1577
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
VEHICLES, POLICE VEHICLES, YOU

1578
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
KNOW, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.

1579
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
SO A LOT OF THE DAY WAS SPENT

1580
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
GETTING OUT OF THERE.

1581
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
AND THEN I GOT MY WIFE AND MY

1582
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
DAUGHTER HOME AND HAD TO GO TO

1583
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
THE OTHER SCHOOL TO GET MY SON

1584
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
OUT OF LOCKDOWN AND WE HAD TO

1585
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
WAIT FOR THAT.

1586
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
AND THEN WE FINALLY GOT HOME.

1587
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
AND I JUST SAID, LOOK, WE NEED A

1588
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
QUIET NIGHT TOGETHER AS A FAMILY

1589
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
AND PRAY FOR THOSE POOR KIDS AND

1590
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
THOSE POOR FACULTY MEMBERS WHO

1591
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
WE KNOW SO MANY OF THEM.

1592
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THE

1593
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
NAMES COME OUT, BUT IT'S JUST

1594
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
SOMETHING THAT RIGHT NOW I CAN'T

1595
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
EVEN FATHOM WHEN THEY RELEASE

1596
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
THE NAMES OF THOSE CHILDREN WHO

1597
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I'M SURE WE ALL -- WE KNOW AND

1598
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
WE KNOW THEIR FAMILIES AND THE

1599
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
FACULTY MEMBERS AND, SO, I

1600
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
REALLY DON'T HAVE A PLAN IS TO

1601
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.

1602
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
>> PLEASE KNOW THAT ALL OF OUR

1603
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
THOUGHTS ARE WITH YOU.

1604
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY'S THOUGHTS

1605
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
ARE WITH YOU AND YOUR COMMUNITY

1606
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
THIS MORNING.

1607
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH

1608
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
US.

00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING SO

1610
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
STRONG.

1611
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
THANK YOU.

1612
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000

1614
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000

AND WHAT HE SAID, WHAT DECLAN

1616
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
SAID, IT'S GOING TO BE SO HARD

1617
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
WHEN THE NAMES COME OUT BECAUSE

1618
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
PEOPLE DID TRY AND HAVE A QUIET

1619
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
NIGHT LAST NIGHT.

1620
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
THEY DON'T KNOW THE NAMES.

1621
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
THE PARENTS WHO DIDN'T GET THEIR

1622
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
KIDS BACK KNOW WHO THEY ARE,

1623
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
KNOW WHO THEIR KIDS ARE.

1624
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
EVERYBODY ELSE DOESN'T.

1625
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
THIS MORNING AT 8:00 A.M.
