HE HAD BULLETS GOING BY HIM AND

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
GRABBED HIM AND ANOTHER CHILD

89
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
EVACUATED TO A NEARBY FIRE HOUSE

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
>> ONE OF THE COPS SAID IT WAS

116
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THE WORST THING HE'D EVER SEEN

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
IN HIS ENTIRE CAREER, BUT IT WAS

118
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
WHEN THEY TOLD THE PARENTS, ALL

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
THESE PARENTS WERE WAITING FOR

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
THEY'LL THOUGHT THEY WERE, YOU

THERE'S 20 PARENTS THAT WERE

JUST TOLD THEIR CHILDREN ARE

124
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000

IT WAS AWFUL.

125

126
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000

EMOTIONAL PRESIDENT OBAMA FOUGHT

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000

132
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
OUR CHILDREN A LITTLE TIGHTER

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
AND WE'LL TELL THEM THAT WE LOVE

134
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
THEM.
AND WE'LL REMIND EACH OTHER HOW

135
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

136
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

137
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CANNOT DO THAT

138
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
WEIGHT OF THE SHOOTING TRAGEDY

145
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
GOT HEAVIER AND HEAVIER.

146
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
FIRST, WORD OF THE SHOOTING AT

147
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

WIND RIGHT OUT OF YOU.

154
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
AND FOR MANY OF US, IT REALLY,

155
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
REALLY DID.
THAT WAS LIKELY THE SAME CASE

156
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
FOR POLICE WHO WERE AT THE

157
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
SCENE.
THERE WERE GRIEF COUNSELORS NOT

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
JUST FOR THE FAMILIES, BUT ALSO

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
FOR THE FIRST RESPONDERS.

160
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
INVESTIGATORS DESPITE THE

ANALYST MIKE BROOKS.

165
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
FIRST OF ALL, MIKE, I HAVE TO

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
ASK YOU, HOW DO INVESTIGATORS AT

167
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A SCENE LIKE THIS, HOW DO THEY

168
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
DEAL WITH THEIR JOBS WHILE THE

169
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
SCOPE OF THE TRAGEDY IS JUST

170
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
STARING THEM IN THE FACE?

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
>> YOU KNOW, JOHN, LAW

172
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
ENFORCEMENT, FIRST RESPONDERS,

THEY ARE ALL HUMAN ALSO.

174
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
AND MANY OF THEM HAVE YOUNG LIKE

175
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
WERE KILLED THERE IN THE SCHOOL.

176
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
BUT YOU HAVE TO COMPARTMENTALIZE

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
THAT AND KNOW THAT YOU ARE THERE
TO DO A JOB.

178
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
IT'S VERY, VERY HARD.

179
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
IN FACT, WE HEARD THE LIEUTENANT

180
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000

ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO WERE

185
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
THERE WHO WERE THE FIRST ONES

186
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
IN.
THEY WERE GETTING THEM

187
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL HELP.

188
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
IF THEY DID NEED IT.

189
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT

190
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
THEY DO HAVE CRISIS INTERVENTION

191
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
TEAMS THERE TO DO ON SCENE

192
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
DIFFUSINGS AND TO DO A FULL

193
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
STRESS DEBRIEFING SHOULD IT

194
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
HAPPEN.

195
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
BECAUSE, JOHN, THESE ARE THE

196
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
PEOPLE WHILE THEY'RE PROCESSING

197
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
THAT SCENE, THEY CAN'T LOOK

198
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
AWAY.
>> WALK ME THROUGH THE LOGISTICS

199
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
OF WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING OVER

200
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
THE LAST EIGHT HOURS.

201
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
WE'VE BEEN SAYING ONE OF THE

202
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
TRULY SAD THINGS IS THE BODIES

203
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
OF THE KIDS WERE STILL THERE

204
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
OVERNIGHT.
THE VICTIMS STILL LYING THERE.

205
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER DEAD

206
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
BELIEVED TO BE OBVIOUSLY.

207
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
IT IS A CRIME SCENE, THOUGH, SO

208
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
WHAT ARE INVESTIGATORS LOOKING

209
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
FOR AT THIS POINT?
>> THEY ARE LOOKING FOR ANY

210
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
LITTLE PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT

211
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
NEEDS TO BE GATHERED.

212
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
THEY'RE TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS,

213
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
THEY'RE VIDEOTAPING.

214
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
THEY'RE DOING DIAGRAMS.

215
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
YOU FIGURE YOU HAVE -- A MAJOR

216
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
SCENE WITH OVER 26 DEATHS, JOHN.

217
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
THAT IS JUST AN UNBELIEVABLE

218
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
SCENE.
I'VE WORKED BOMBING SCENES WHERE

219
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THERE HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF

220
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
PEOPLE INJURED, HUNDREDS OF

221
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
PEOPLE KILLED, BUT YOU HAVE

222
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
LITTLE KIDS AND, STILL, IT'S

223
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
VERY DIFFICULT.

224
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
BUT THEY'VE GOT A JOB TO DO.

225
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
YES, THE SHOOTER IS DEAD, THE

226
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
ALLEGED SHOOTER IS DEAD, IS

227
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
THERE ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED IN

228
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
THIS?
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.

229
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
BUT IT'S THE LAW ENFORCEMENT'S

230
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
JOB TO GO IN THERE AND DO A

231
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
THOROUGH AND ACCURATE ACCOUNTING

232
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
OF EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

233
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
THERE'S SO MUCH EVIDENCE INSIDE

234
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
THAT SCHOOL, OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL

235
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
POSSIBLY, HIS CAR.

236
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
AND THEN THE IDENTIFICATION OF

237
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
THE CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY HAVE

238
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
DONE A PRELIMINARY

239
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
IDENTIFICATION.
THEY KNOW WHO THESE CHILDREN

240
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
ARE.

241
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
THE PARENTS KNEW WHO THEY ARE.

242
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
THEY HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT

243
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
ASSIGNED TO THEM TO KEEP THEM UP

244
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
TO DATE.

245
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
BUT, BY LAW THEY HAVE TO DO AN

246
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
IDENTIFICATION, A THOROUGH -- A

247
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF WHO

248
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
THESE CHILDREN ARE.

249
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
AND WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HEAR

250
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
ABOUT THAT THIS MORNING.

251
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
BUT, AGAIN, JUST A TOUGH JOB FOR

252
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE FIRST

253
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
RESPONDERS, FIRE, EMS, AND THESE

254
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
CRIME SCENE TECHNICIANS FROM THE

255
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
CONNECTICUT STATE MEDICAL

256
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
EXAMINER'S OFFICE WHO HAVE BEEN

257
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
IN THERE ALL NIGHT DOCUMENTING

258
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
EVERY LITTLE BIT OF EVIDENCE

259
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
THEY FIND.

260
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
>> SO, MIKE, LET'S REWIND A

261
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
LITTLE BIT TO THE MOMENTS AFTER

262
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
IT BEGINS TO HAPPEN.

263
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
AND WHAT THE POLICE, WHAT THE

264
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
FIRST RESPONDERS ARE TRAINED TO

265
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
DO.
AND LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THIS.

266
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING

267
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
ME ABOUT THIS QUESTION OVER THE

268
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
LAST SEVERAL HOURS, EVACUATION

269
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
VERSUS LOCKDOWN.

270
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY FOR THE

271
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
SCHOOL TO HANDLE IT?

272
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
TO GET THE KIDS OUT RIGHT AWAY?

273
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
OR IS IT TO STAY IN PLACE AND

274
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
GET THEM TO A SAFE PLACE IN THE

275
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
CLASSROOM?
>> WELL, THEY TRAIN FOR THESE

276
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
THINGS.
WE KNOW THEY HAD THEIR ANNUAL

277
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
EVACUATION DRILL BACK IN OCTOBER

278
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

279
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
JOHN.

280
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
BUT IT'S WHAT THE SITUATION

281
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
DICTATES.
WE'VE HEARD SO MANY STORIES NOW

282
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
OF TEACHERS PULLING KIDS OUT OF

283
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
THE HALLWAYS AND SHELTERING IN

284
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
PLACE, IF YOU WILL, WHILE THEY

285
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
WAITED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

286
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
COME, LAW ENFORCEMENT CAME, ONE

287
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
TEACHER STILL DIDN'T THINK IT

288
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
WAS REALLY LAW ENFORCEMENT ASKED

289
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
TO SEE THEIR BADGES, SLID THEIR

290
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
BADGE UNDER THE DOOR.

291
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
AND THEY SAID IF YOU REALLY ARE

292
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT, YOU CAN OPEN

293
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
THE DOER WITH THE KEY, THEY DID

294
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
AND GOT THE CHILDREN OUT.

295
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I WAS LISTENING, JOHN, YESTERDAY

296
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
TO THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE

297
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
FREQUENCY WHILE ALL THIS WAS

298
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
HAPPENING, WHILE UNITS WERE

299
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
RESPONDING TO THE SCENE AND HAVE

300
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
BEEN LISTENING TO SOME OF THE

301
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
FIRST UNITS FROM NEWTOWN POLICE

302
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
THAT WERE THERE.

303
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU TRAIN FOR AN

304
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
ACTIVE SHOOTER SCENARIO, BUT YOU

305
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
HOPE YOU NEVER HAVE TO USE IT.

306
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
BUT SOUNDS, JOHN, THAT THESE

307
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
FIRST RESPONDERS, THE LAW

308
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
ENFORCEMENT, WHEN THEY WENT IN,

309
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAD

310
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
TO DO.

311
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
AND THEIR JOB WAS TO MAKE SURE

312
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
THESE KIDS WERE SAFE, THAT THESE

313
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
KIDS WERE EITHER HUNKERED DOWN,

314
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
BUT THEY WERE GOING AFTER THAT

315
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
GUNMAN.

316
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
AND TRY TO NEUTRALIZE THIS
PERSON.

317
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
BUT WE HEARD THAT LAW

318
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
ENFORCEMENT DID NOT FIRE A SHOT.

319
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
BUT THE COORDINATION BETWEEN LAW

320
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
ENFORCEMENT, FIRE, AND EMS

321
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS TEXTBOOK.

322
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE SO MANY
VICTIMS INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.

323
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
>> MIKE BROOKS, THANK YOU SO

324
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
MUCH FOR BEING WITH US THIS

325
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
MORNING.

326
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
THE INVESTIGATION INTO THIS OR

327
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
HORRIFIC SCENE, THIS AWFUL

328
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
TRAGEDY, IT DOES CONTINUE.

329
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
>>> MEANWHILE, SHE IS BEING

330
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
REMEMBERED AS CARING, SOMEONE

331
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
WHO LOVED HER STUDENTS, MORE ON

332
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
THE PRINCIPAL WHO LOST HER LIFE

333
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
IN THIS TRAGIC CONNECTICUT

334
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING.

335
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
BUT FIRST, WHILE INVESTIGATORS

336
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
FAMILIES AND THE NATION TRY TO

337
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
MAKE SENSE OF THIS ENTIRE

338
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
SITUATION, WE WILL BE TALKING

339
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
ABOUT THE VICTIMS, THE VICTIMS

340
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
OF THIS TRAGEDY, WHO THEY ARE,

341
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
AND WE'LL PIECE TOGETHER SOME

342
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
MOMENTS OF THEIR LIVES.

343
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

344
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
>> THIS IS A VERY, VERY TRAGIC,

345
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
TRAGIC SCENE FOR EVERYBODY.

346
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
CERTAINLY OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN

347
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
FOR THE FAMILIES HERE.

348
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, ABOUT 9:30,

349
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
9:40, WE HEARD NOISES, AND THE

350
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM WAS STILL

351
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
ON, SO IT DIDN'T GO OFF.

352
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
YOU COULD HEAR WHAT SOUNDED LIKE

353
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
POPS, GUN SHOTS.

354
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
>> HER TEACHER MANAGED TO TAKE

355
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
TWO CHILDREN OUT OF THE HALLWAY.

356
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
PULL THEM INTO THE CLASSROOM,

357
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
LOCK THE DOOR AND MOVE EVERYBODY

358
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM.

359
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
>> WE JUST TOLD THE LITTLE BOY

360
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
ABOUT HIS SISTER NOW.

361
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
WHO AM I GOING TO PLAY WITH, HE

362
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
SAID?
I HAVE NOBODY TO PLAY WITH NOW.

363
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
EXCUSE ME.

364
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
>> WHEN YOUR FIRST GRADER GOES

365
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
TO BED AND SAYS, MOMMY, IS

366
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
ANYONE FROM MY CLASS LAST YEAR?

367
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
ARE THEY ALL OKAY?

368
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
ARE THEY ALL OKAY?

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
REMEMBER HER AS SOMEBODY WHO

470
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
IN A TIME LIKE THIS AND NOW THEY

485
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000

THOSE PEOPLE YOU JUST TALKED

529
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
ABOUT IN THE SCHOOL WHEN THE

530
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
GUNMAN OPENED FIRE.

531
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
WHAT DID THAT PARENT SAY?

532
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000

546
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000

547
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
BOTH SHERLOCK AND HOCHSPRUNG DID

548
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
NOT RETURN.

549
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000

YOU'LL BE WATCHING AS WE WILL

VERY CLOSELY IN JUST A FEW

554
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
MOMENTS.

555
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY, VERY

556
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
IMPORTANT NEWS CONFERENCE
HAPPENING RIGHT NEXT TO ME.

557
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
JOHN BERMAN IN NEWTOWN,

558
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
CONNECTICUT, WITH ME.

559
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
AT THE TOWN SQUARE.

560
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
JOHN, THIS IS GOING TO BE

561
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
DEVASTATING IN A FEW MINUTES.

562
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY IN THIS

563
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
TOWN WHO KNOW THEY HAVE THEIR

564
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
CHILDREN MANY IN TOWN THAT KNOW

565
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
20 CHILDREN AND SIX ADULTS WERE

566
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
KILLED.

567
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
AND SOME TIME AFTER THE NEXT 10

568
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
OR 15 MINUTES, THEY'RE GOING TO

569
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
HEAR THOSE NAMES AND THAT WILL

570
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
OPEN UP A WHOLE NEW SET OF

571
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
WOUNDS FOR THIS TOWN, WOUNDS

572
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
THAT HAVE HARDLY EVEN HAD A

573
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
CHANCE TO START HEALING SINCE

574
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
LAST NIGHT.
IT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH TIME IN

575
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
THE NEXT FEW MINUTES, JOHN.

576
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
>> I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

577
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
RIGHT, ALI.

578
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I THINK THOSE NAMES ARE GOING TO

579
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
MAKE THIS REALITY ALL THE MORE

580
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
PAINFUL FOR THE PEOPLE HERE.

581
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'M STANDING IN FRONT OF, BY THE

582
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
WAY, THE ST. ROSE OF LIMA

583
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
CATHOLIC CHURCH WHERE THERE WAS

584
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
A VIGIL.
MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE IN THIS

585
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
COMMUNITY GATHERED HERE TO BE

586
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
TOGETHER TO GRIEVE TOGETHER.

587
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE HERE KNEW

588
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
PEOPLE WHO WERE AT THE SCHOOL,

589
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
SO MANY PEOPLE HERE DIRECTLY

590
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
AFFECTED BY WHAT WENT ON.

591
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
EARLIER I SPOKE TO THE FATHER OF

592
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
ONE CHILD WHO SURVIVED THE

593
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
SHOOTING.

594
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
AND IT WAS A TOUGH CONVERSATION.

595
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO TOUGH

596
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
CONVERSATION.

597
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY

598
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
ABOUT HOW HIS DAUGHTER IS COPI

599
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
WITH THE SITUATION AND HOW HE

600
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
FOUND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.

601
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
>> SHE'S DOING SURPRISINGLY WELL

602
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
AFTER WHAT SHE SAW.

603
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
>> HOW DID THIS GO DOWN FOR YOU

604
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
YESTERDAY?
WHEN DID YOU FIRST GET WORD THAT

605
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
SOMETHING HORRIBLE WAS HAPPENING

606
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
AT THE SCHOOL?

607
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU AND WHAT

608
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
DID THEY ASK YOU TO DO?

609
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
>> I WORK AN HOUR-PLUS AWAY AND

610
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
MY WIFE CALLED ME TO SAY THERE

611
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
WAS A SHOOTING.

612
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
SHE HAD ALREADY RUSHED TO THE

613
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
SCHOOL TO GET MY DAUGHTER, THEY

614
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
MADE THEIR WAY TO THE FIREHOUSE.

615
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I WAS ABLE TO GET TO THE

616
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
FIREHOUSE EVENTUALLY AND AT THAT

617
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
TIME IT WAS JUST TOO EARLY.

618
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
WE HAD NO IDEA ABOUT ALL THE

619
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
CHILDREN AND THE FACT OF WHO HAD

620
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
DIED.
>> YOU KNEW YOUR DAUGHTER WAS

621
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
OKAY, THOUGH, CORRECT?

622
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
>> THANK GOD WE KNEW SHE WAS

623
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
OKAY AND JUST GAVE HER A BIG HUG

624
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
AND JUST GOT HER OUT OF THERE.

625
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
>> DECLAN, SO MANY PARENTS

626
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING

627
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
ME, FRANKLY, WANT TO KNOW HOW TO

628
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
TALK TO OUR KIDS ABOUT THIS.

629
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
OUR KIDS DIDN'T GO THROUGH THIS,

630
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
HAS YOUR DAUGHTER ASKS YOU ANY

631
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

632
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
>> WELL, THAT'S THE VERY

633
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
DIFFICULT QUESTION.

634
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
YOU KNOW, THIS IS ALL NEW.

635
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
SO ALL WE REALLY CAN DO, AND I

636
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
THINK IS THE BEST THING, IS TO

637
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
BE HONEST AND LET HER KNOW WHAT

638
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
WE KNOW.
TRY TO TALK TO THEM AND TRY TO

639
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
REINFORCE THAT THE BAD GUY THAT

640
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
DID THIS IS GONE FOREVER.

641
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
BECAUSE, OF COURSE, ALL THEY ARE

642
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
TALKING ABOUT IS NOT WANTING TO

643
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
GO TO SCHOOL AGAIN.

644
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
BOTH OF MY CHILDREN.

645
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I HAVE A 10-YEAR-OLD WHO WAS IN

646
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
ANOTHER SCHOOL ON LOCKDOWN AS

647
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
WELL.
AND THEY ARE JUST REALLY, REALLY

648
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
FREAKED OUT.

649
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.

650
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY.

651
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
THEY ARE TALKING TO YOU, THEY

652
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL

653
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
AGAIN.
DID YOU DAUGHTER TELL YOU

654
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE

655
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
TO BE IN THE SCHOOL AS THIS WAS

656
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
HAPPENING?
>> SHE WAS IN HER READING CLASS,

657
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
AND IT WAS A SEPARATED CLASS

658
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
WITH JUST, USUALLY THERE'S JUST

659
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
A FEW KIDS IN THERE, AND SHE

660
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
HEARD A BUNCH OF BANGING, WHAT

661
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
SOUNDED LIKE HAMMERING, SHE

662
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
SAID.

663
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
AND HER TEACHER, HER READING

664
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
TEACHER, GRABBED MY DAUGHTER AS

665
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
WELL AS A FELLOW TEACHER THAT

666
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
WAS IN THE READING ROOM, AND

667
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
ACTUALLY LOCKED THEM IN THE

668
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
BATHROOM AND THEY JUST HEARD

669
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
LOTS OF SHOTS.

670
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I THINK MY DAUGHTER SAID SHE

671
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
HEARD SCREAMING AND EVENTUALLY

672
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
THE POLICE WERE BANGING ON THE

673
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
DOOR AND WERE ABLE TO ESCORT

674
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
THEM INTO THE HALLWAY, GET THEM

675
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
OUT TOWARDS, UNFORTUNATELY,

676
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
WHERE FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,

677
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
WHERE MOST OF THE SHOOTINGS

678
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
HAPPENED, WHICH IS A PRETTY

679
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
ROUGH SCENE FROM WHAT I

680
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
UNDERSTAND FROM WHAT MY DAUGHTER

681
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
TOLD ME.

682
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
AND THEN THEY WERE ABLE TO WHISK

683
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
THEM AWAY TO THE FIREHOUSE.

684
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
AND I BELIEVE MY DAUGHTER, FROM

685
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
WHAT SHE TELLS ME, WAS THE FIRST

686
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
KID TO GET TO THE FIREHOUSE.

687
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
>> Reporter: THAT WAS DECLAN IS

688
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
THE FATHER OF AN 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL

689
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
WHO SURVIVED THIS HORRIBLE

690
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
EVENT.
HE'S TALKING TO HER AND HIS

691
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
10-YEAR-OLD SON WITH SO MANY

692
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
QUESTIONS.

693
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
THE SADDEST THING I HAVE HEARD

694
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
IS THAT HIS KIDS DON'T WANT TO

695
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

696
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
AS FAMILY AND FRIENDS TRY TO

697
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS TRAGEDY,

698
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
MANY ARE TURNING TO THEIR FAITH

699
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
FOR ANSWERS.

700
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
CNN'S ANDERSON COOPER ASKED A

701
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
LOCAL CHURCH LEADER HOW HE HELPS

702
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
THE PEOPLE IN MOURNING.

703
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
>> WHAT CAN YOU REALLY SAY?

704
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
MANY OF THEM JUST SAID TO ME,

705
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WITH

706
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
US.
WE PRAY TOGETHER, WE HUGGED EACH

707
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
OTHER THERE, WERE A LOT OF

708
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
TEARS.

709
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
CERTAINLY A LOT OF EMOTION.

710
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
AND IT HAS NOT REALLY SETTLED

711
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
INTO THEIR LIVES THAT THEIR

712
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
CHILD HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM THEM.

713
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I MUST SAY FOR THE PARENTS I

714
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
SPOKE WITH TODAY THERE WAS A

715
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LOVE FOR
THESE CHILDREN.

716
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
AND I KNOW THE DAYS AHEAD ARE

717
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT AND

718
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
WE AS A COMMUNITY, CERTAINLY AS

719
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
A CHURCH COMMUNITY, WILL BE

720
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
PRESENT TO THEM.

721
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
BUT THE WORDS, WHAT CAN YOU SAY

722
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

723
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
>> THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT OF

724
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
PARENTS WRESTLING AROUND THE

725
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD

726
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
RIGHT NOW WITH WHAT ARE THEY

727
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
GOING THE SAY TO THEIR CHILDREN

728
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
WHO ASK THEM QUESTIONS ABOUT

729
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
THIS?

730
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
WHAT WILL YOU RECOMMEND FOR

731
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
PEOPLE TO SAY TO THEIR KIDS, NOT

732
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
KIDS FROM NEWTOWN WHO WERE AT

733
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
THE SCHOOL, BUT JUST WHO HEAR

734
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
ABOUT THIS AND WANT TO KNOW, ARE

735
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
THEY SAFE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

736
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
>> I THINK THAT'S THE ONE THING

737
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
YOU HAVE TO ENSURE THEM ABOUT.

738
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
SOME CIRCUMSTANCES ARE BEYOND

739
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
ANY HUMAN CONTROL, BUT WE HAVE

740
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
TO TEACH THE CHILDREN TO TRUST.

741
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I KNOW IT'S A DIFFICULT WORLD IN

742
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
WHICH WE LIVE AND IT IS VERY

743
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
DIFFICULT TO TRUST EVERYONE, BUT

744
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
THEY HAVE TO HAVE FAITH.

745
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE FAITH IN

746
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
GOD AND FAITH IN EACH OTHER.

747
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
AND I HOPE THAT THESE PARENTS

748
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
WILL CERTAINLY LEARN FROM THIS.

749
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
ONCE AGAIN, THE VALUE OF FAMILY

750
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
AND KEEP PRIORITIES STRAIGHT.

751
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
THE CHILDREN NEED TO KNOW THEY

752
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
ARE LOVED AND THEY ARE IN

753
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
ENVIRONMENTS THAT CAN BE SAFE

754
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
AND AN ENVIRONMENT TO GROW UP TO

755
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
BE PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS.

756
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU TAKE THE

757
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
FEAR OUT OF A CHILD'S HEART

758
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
EXCEPT BY LOVE, AND THESE

759
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
CHILDREN TODAY WERE CERTAINLY

760
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
DEEPLY LOVED BY THEIR PARENTS.

761
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
>> ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE IN THE

762
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
NEWTOWN COMMUNITY PACKED THIS

763
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
CHURCH FOR A VIGIL INSIDE AND

764
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
OUTSIDE.
SOME PEOPLE WERE CRYING THERE,

765
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
WERE HUGS AND SO MANY PEOPLE

766
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
PRAYING FOR THE LIVES OF THOSE

767
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
WHO WERE LOST.

768
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
SO MANY OF THE SURVIVORS,

769
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
OBVIOUSLY, ARE STILL IN SHOCK

770
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
TODAY, BUT AT LEAST ONE OF THE

771
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
TEACHERS AT SANDY HOOK

772
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KEPT HER COOL

773
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
EVEN AFTER HEARING THE GUNSHOTS.

774
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
JANET BALMER ALSO SPOKE TO

775
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
ANDERSON COOPER.

776
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
>> ABOUT 9:30, 9:40, WE HEARD

777
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
ANNOUNCEMENTS AND THE

778
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM WAS STILL

779
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
ON.
SO YOU COULD HEAR WHAT SOUNDED

780
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
LIKE POPS, GUNSHOTS, OF COURSE

781
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL THAT TO

782
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
5-YEAR-OLDS, SO I SAID TO THEM,

783
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
WELL, WE ARE GOING OVER TO A

784
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
SAFE AREA AND WE ARE GOING TO,

785
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
YOU KNOW, WE READ A STORY AND

786
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
KEPT THEM CALM.
WE DID A LOCKDOWN DRILL AND

787
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
CLOSED THE DOORS, LOCKED AND

788
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
COVERED THE WINDOWS, YOU KNOW,

789
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
KEPT THE CHILDREN WITH US.

790
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I HAVE OTHER ADULTS IN MY --

791
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
>> I FIND THAT AMAZING -- I FIND

792
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
THAT AMAZING, FEARING THAT YOU

793
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
HEAR GUNSHOTS, YOU WERE ABLE TO

794
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
HAVE THE COMPOSURE TO SIT DOWN

795
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
TO READ TO YOUR STUDENTS.

796
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I MEAN, THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.

797
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

798
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
WITH 5-YEAR-OLDS BECAUSE YOU

799
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
CAN'T LOSE IT.

800
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG

801
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
TIME.
IT'S MY 18th YEAR OF TEACHING

802
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
AND MY JOB WAS TO KEEP THEM

803
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
SAFE.

804
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I DIDN'T KNOW, THERE WAS NO

805
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
ANNOUNCEMENT OF WHAT WAS GOING

806
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
ON.

807
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
MYNSTINCT WAS IT WASN'T GOOD.

808
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
WE KEPT THEM CALM AND STAYED IN

809
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
THE ROOM UNTIL THERE WAS BANGING

810
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
AT THE DOOR UNTIL IT WAS THE

811
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
POLICE AND THE TROOPERS AND

812
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
WHOEVER WAS THERE.

813
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
AND THEY HAD US EXIT THE

814
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
BUILDING.
>> Reporter: IT'S OUR JOB TO

815
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
KEEP THEM SAFE, SHE SAID.

816
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
WE ALSO HEARD FROM ANOTHER

817
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
TEACHER INSIDE HER CLASSROOM

818
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
DURING THIS AWFUL MORNING.
IN AN INTERVIEW WITH ABC NEWS,

819
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
FIRST GRADE TEACHER KAITLIN ROIG

820
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
TALKED TO HER STUDENTS.

821
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
>> I NEED YOU TO KNOW I LOVE YOU

822
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
VERY MUCH AND IT IS GOING TO BE

823
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
OKAY.
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL GOING TO

824
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
DIE.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S

825
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
OKAY.

826
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
TEACHERS, I WANT THEM TO KNOW

827
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
SOMEONE LOVED THEM AND I WANTED

828
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
THAT TO BE ONE OF THE LAST

829
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
THINGS THEY HEARD.

830
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
NOT THE GUNFIRE IN THE HALLWAY.

831
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
IT WAS SO HORRIBLE.

832
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
>> Reporter: SO MANY OF US LOOK

833
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
TO TEACHERS AS HEROES ALL THE

834
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
TIME, FRANKLY, BUT MANY PARENTS

835
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
LAST NIGHT WERE THANKFUL FOR THE

836
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
BRAVE TEACHERS, ESPECIALLY

837
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
THANKFUL FOR HELPING GET THEIR

838
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
CHILDREN TO SAFETY.

839
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
ONE DAUGHTER SPOKE TO HER MOTHER

840
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE INSIDE

841
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
THE SANDY HOOK HIGH SCHOOL.

842
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
HER MOTHER SHARED THAT STORY

843
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
WITH ANDERSON.

844
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
>> SHE DID MENTION THAT SHE DID,

845
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
OF COURSE, HEAR GUNSHOTS.

846
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
THEY WERE ON THE SAME FLOOR.

847
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
SHE, HER TEACHER, MANAGED TO

848
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
TAKE TWO CHILDREN OUT OF THE

849
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
HALLWAY, PULL THEM INTO THE

850
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
CLASSROOM, LOCK THE DOOR AND

851
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
MOVE EVERYBODY OVER TO THE OTHER

852
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
SIDE OF THE ROOM.

853
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
IT WAS VERY CONFUSING, AS IT

854
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
WOULD BE IN ANY OF THESE CASES,

855
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
TO GO AND PICK UP YOUR CHILD

856
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
ONCE WE FIGURED OUT THAT

857
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
EVERYBODY WAS DISPATCHED TO

858
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

859
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PARENT

860
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
THERE IS ALONG WITH A FRIEND OF

861
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
MINE.
WE BOTH FIGURED OUT WHAT WAS

862
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
GOING ON AND RAN OVER THERE.

863
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
THEY WERE SMART TO GET THEM OUT

864
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
OF THE BUILDING AND MOVED THEM

865
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
OVER TO THE FIREHOUSE, BUT YOU

866
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
COULD SEE MY DAUGHTER'S TEACHER

867
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
WAS VISIBLY UPSET AS WELL AS

868
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
MANY OF THE CHILDREN THERE.

869
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
AND SHE DID A VERY HEROIC THING

870
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
AND PULLED TWO KIDS OUT OF THE

871
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
HALLWAY AND JUST SHOVED THEM THE

872
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
CLASS AND LOCKED THAT DOOR UP.

873
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
AND THE KIDS ARE GOING TO SUFFER

874
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
FROM
