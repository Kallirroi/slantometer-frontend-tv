WITH A JERSEY NUMBER 80.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
WE WILL GET TO THE TOP STORY

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
TONIGHT.
HE SHUN ATTENTION UNTIL HE

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
DIDN'T.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
ADAM LANZA WAS AN AWKWARD

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
LOANER WHO PRESSED HIMSELF

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
AGAINST THE WALL WHEN OTHERS

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
APPROACHED IN THE HALLWAY.

57
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
NOW A SHATTERED AND DEVASTATED

58
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
TOWN IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

59
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
WHY HE SLAUGHTERED HIS MOTHER

60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
AND 26 OTHER ADULTS.

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
HE HAD PROBLEMS, PROBLEMS THAT

62
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
WENT BEYOND LACK OF SOCIAL

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
SKILLS.

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
THEY ASSIGNED HIM A PERMANENT

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
PSYCHOLOGIST AS A 9th

66
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
GRADER AND FLAGGED HIM TO THE

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
SECURITY CHIEF.

68
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
HE WAS MENTALLY ILL, CLEARLY,

69
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
AND THERE WERE REPORTS HE HAD

70
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
ASPBUREGER'S A MILDER FORM OF

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
AUTISM.

72
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
BUT WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING.

73
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
BUT IT HAS PUT THE SPOTLIGHT

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
ON MENTAL HEALTH.

75
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
AS ONE PSYCHOLOGIST TOLD USA

76
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
TODAY, IF WE WILL FOCUS ON

77
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
PREVENTION, WE CAN'T THINK OF

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
THE GUNMAN IN THE PARKING LOT

79
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
AND WHAT TO DO WITH THEM.

80
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
WE HAVE TO GET INVOLVED A LOT

81
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
EARLIER.

82
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
JIM, SO THIS GUY WAS AN

83
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
AWKWARD LONER AND PAINFULLY

84
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
QUIET.
SO ARE A LOT OF TEENAGERS.

85
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
HOW DO YOU DIFFERENTIATE?

86
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
CAN YOU?
>> YOU JUST KNOW.

87
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
WE ARE TAUGHT TO BE POLITE.

88
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I LOVE HOW THEY SAY YOU CAN'T

89
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
JUDGE A BOOK BY THE COVER.

90
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
EVERY TIME I SEE A SCHOOL

91
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
SHOOTER HE LOOKS LIKE A SCHOOL

92
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
SHOOTER LOOKS.

93
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
THEY HAVE THE SAME STUPID

94
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
VACANT LOOK.

95
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
THEY GIVE YOU THE CREEPS, BUT

96
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
YOU ARE TAUGHT NOT TO TREAT

97
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
THEM LIKE THAT.

98
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
SOMEBODY GIVES YOU THE CREEPS

99
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
AND IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE

100
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
CREEPY.
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE DID IT,

101
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
BUT HE IS A PSYCHO PATH.

102
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
THAT'S WHY HE DID IT.

103
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
WHY DID THE KILLER KILL?

104
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
BECAUSE HE IS INSANE.

105
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO FIND A

106
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
REASON THAT MAKES SENSE OR

107
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
MAKES IT ACCEPTABLE OR MAKES

108
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
IT LESS RANDOM.
I AM JUST TIRED OF OBSESSING

109
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
ON WHY THE MENTALLY ILL DO

110
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
WHAT THEY DO.

111
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
>> JEDEDIAH, GOOD POINT, BUT

112
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS SAY THE

113
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
PERPETRATORS OF MASS MURDERS

114
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
OF VIRGINIA TECH AND OTHER

115
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
THINGS ALL SUFFERED FROM

116
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
SERIOUS MENTAL ISSUES AS JIM

117
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
WAS SAYING.

118
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
CAN WE FOCUS MORE ATTENTION ON

119
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
THESE PEOPLE AND TRY TO HEAD

120
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
THIS STUFF OFF AT THE PASS?

121
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
>> I THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE

122
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
OUT WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHY

123
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
THESE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE

124
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
GOING UNADDRESSED.
IT IS THE JOB OF A

125
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
PSYCHOLOGIST TO SEE WHY THEY

126
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
POSE A THREAT.
IF THEY ARE DOING THEIR JOB

127
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THEY CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN

128
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOANERS AND

129
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
A LITTLE ODD VERSUS PEOPLE WHO

130
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
ARE DANGEROUS.

131
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
ANOTHER QUESTION I HAVE WAS

132
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
WAS HE ON MEDICATION?

133
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
A LOT OF THESE MEDICATIONS

134
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
USED TO TREAT DEPRESSION,

135
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
ANXIETY AND ADD HAVE SERIOUS

136
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
SIDE AFFECTS THAT COULD

137
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
POTENTIALLY MAKE YOU HAVE

138
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
OUTBURSTS AND MAKE A SIDE OF

139
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
YOUR PERSONALITY COME OUT YOU

140
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
DIDN'T KNOW EXISTED.

141
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I HAVE SEEN THIS WITH KIDS IN

142
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
SCHOOLS WHERE THEIR

143
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
PERSONALITY CHANGES AS RESULT

144
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
OF MEDICATION.

145
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I AM NOT SAYING THAT IS THE

146
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
SOLE CAUSE, BUT COULD BE A

147
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.

148
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
>> AT THIS JUNCTURE WE DON'T

149
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
KNOW.

150
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
>> WE DON'T KNOW.

151
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'M SAYING THAT'S ONE OF THE

152
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
QUESTIONS THE REPORTERS SHOULD

153
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
BE ASKING.
WAS HE ON MED?

154
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
>> SOME STATES HAVE THE

155
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT

156
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
LAWS THAT ALLOW JUDGES TO

157
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
ORDER PEOPLE WITH A SERIOUS

158
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
MENTAL ILLNESS TO GO INTO

159
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
TREATMENT.

160
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
THE THING IS THESE PROGRAMS

161
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
ONLY APPLY TO PEOPLE WITH A

162
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
HISTORY OF VIOLENCE OR HAVE

163
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
BEEN INCARCERATED OR

164
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
HOSPITALIZED.

165
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THAT

166
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
WOULD HAVE HELPED HERE.

167
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
IS THERE ANYTHING -- WHAT DO

168
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
YOU THINK?

169
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
>> I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A

170
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

171
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
PROTECTION THAT'S BEEN PUT

172
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
AROUND MENTAL ILLNESS.

173
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
IN MANY RESPECTS FOR GOOD

174
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
REASONS.

175
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
IT IS NOT THE PERSON'S FAULT

176
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
IF THEY SUFFER FROM SOME

177
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE.

178
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
IT IS A DISEASE.

179
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO

180
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
STIGMA TIES THEM FOR SOMETHING

181
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
BEYOND THEIR CONTROL DOESN'T

182
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
MEAN YOU SHOULD HAVE A

183
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
HANDS-OFF ATTITUDE.
THIS IS NOT LIKE HAVING A

184
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
FLU.

185
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THIS IS POTENTIALLY MUCH MORE

186
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
SERIOUS.

187
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I THINK THAT THE NOTION THAT

188
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
BECAUSE MENTAL ILLNESS IS

189
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
STILL SOMETHING WE ARE TRYING

190
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
TO UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TO

191
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
LEAVE PEOPLE ALONE UNTIL A

192
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
TRAGEDY HAPPENS IS JUST THE

193
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
WRONG WAY TO LOOK AT IT.

194
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
>> THE THING IS YOU CAN HELP

195
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
PEOPLE WITHOUT STIGMA TIEING

196
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
THEM.

197
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
>> I THINK THE EARLIER YOU

198
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION

199
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL AND

200
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
CONSIDER INVOLUNTARY -- THIS

201
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

202
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I THINK THE LIBERTARIANS

203
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
UNDERSTANDABLY ARE WORRIED

204
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
ABOUT IT.

205
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
MASS MURDER IS A WORSE

206
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
PROBLEM.
>> SO, BILL, THE SCHOOL

207
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
OFFICIALS WHERE LANZA WENT TO

208
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
SCHOOL, THEY HAD HIM JOIN A

209
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
TECH CLUB THING.

210
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
IT IS TO HELP HIM TRY TO BE

211
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
MORE SOCIAL.

212
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
APPARENTLY IT DIDN'T HELP.

213
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
PEOPLE ARE ASKING SHOULD THE

214
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
SCHOOL HAVE DONE MORE?

215
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
CAN THE SCHOOL DO MORE?

216
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
IS THIS ULTIMATELY NOT THE

217
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
SCHOOL'S RESPONSIBILITY?

218
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS THE

219
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
SCHOOL'S RESPONSIBILITY OR

220
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
NOT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW SOCIAL YOU

221
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
CAN BE IN A TECH CLUB.

222
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
YOU ALSO HAVE TO WONDER HOW

223
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
MUCH IS TOO MUCH AS FAR AS

224
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
THIS COVERAGE IS CONCERNED?

225
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
DILUTION AND NARCISSISM ARE IN

226
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
THE SAME BALLPARK.

227
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
A LOT OF THESE KIDS JUST NEED

228
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
A PUSH.
I WAS LOOKING AT A TABLOID

229
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
THIS WEEKEND, A NEW YORK

230
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
TABLOID, 20 PAGES OF COVERAGE

231
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
DEVOTED TO THIS.

232
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
THE SPORTS SECTION 10.

233
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
AFTER AWHILE, YOU HAVE TO

234
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
WONDER HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH AS

235
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
FAR AS THIS COVERAGE IS

236
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
CONCERNED.
ALL OF THESE KIDS HAVE

237
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
DILUTIONS OF GRAND DURE.

238
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
IN RAPE CASES THEY AGREE NEVER

239
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
TO MENTION THE THAIM OF THE

240
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
VICTIM.

241
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAN

242
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
BE APPLIED TO THE PERPETRATOR

243
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
WHEN SOMETHING COMES TO THIS.

244
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
THESE KIDS ARE ALL ON THE

245
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
EDGE.
ALL IT TAKES IS A LITTLE

246
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
PUSH.

247
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
A LOT OF TIMES THEY SEE A

248
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
COHORT OR SOMEBODY WHO DID

249
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
SOMETHING THAT MAYBE HAS

250
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
CROSSED THEIR MIND AND THEN

251
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THEY MENTION HIS NAME ONE

252
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER.

253
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
IN THEIR MIND THIS IS NOT A

254
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
BAD WAY TO GET THEIR NAME

255
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
OUT.
THERE IN THEIR MIND IT IS

256
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
LIKE -- WOW IF THIS GUY IS

257
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
GOING THIS WAY, WHY CAN'T I BE

258
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
THERE?

259
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
HAVE THE NOTORIATY I FEEL I

260
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
DESERVE.

261
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER
IS, BUT IT IS A LOT.

262
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
>> I THINK THERE IS A LOT TO

263
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
THIS.

264
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
ONE REASON THE MEDIA DON'T

265
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
BROADCAST TERRORIST DEMANDS OR

266
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
READ TERRORIST MAN FESS TOES

267
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
IS THEY DON'T WANT TO

268
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
ENCOURAGE OTHER TERRORISTS.

269
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
IN THE PECULIAR WAY I THINK

270
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
THE MINDS OF SOME OF THESE

271
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
PEOPLE WORK, THEY SEE THIS AS

272
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
A WAY TO GET PUBLICITY.

273
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
IF YOU ARE A LONER AND DON'T

274
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
THINK ANYBODY PAYS ATTENTION

275
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
TO YOU OR CARES YOU OR LOVES

276
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
YOU, AND YET YOU SEE WHAT

277
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
HAPPENS WITH THIS OBSESSIVE

278
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
COVERAGE, I THINK IT IS OVER

279
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
THE TOP FOR MANY REASONS.

280
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
BUT ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT OF

281
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
PEOPLE WHO COULD GO OVER THE

282
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
EDGE IS SOMETHING THE MEDIA

283
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

284
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
ABOUT INSTEAD OF BLAMING OTHER

285
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
PEOPLE.
THIS IS SOMETHING THE MEDIA

286
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
CAN AFFECT ITSELF.
>> JIM, I KNOW YOU HAVE STRONG

287
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
FEELINGS ABOUT IT AND WE

288
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE GREEN

289
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
ROOM, AND YOU PRETTY MUCH

290
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
AGREE WITH THEM.

291
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
LET ME BRING THIS UP THOUGH,

292
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
THE MEDIA COVERS SADDAM

293
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
HUSSEIN.
THE MEDIA COVERS CRAZY

294
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
DICTATORS.
WE DO COVER PEOPLE LIKE THAT

295
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
BECAUSE IT IS NEWSWORTHY.

296
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
HOW DO YOU SAY, WELL YOU

297
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
SHOULDN'T COVER THIS WHEN IT
IS CLEARLY NEWSWORTHY?

298
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
>> WELL, SADDAM HUSSEIN, YOU

299
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
ARE NOT GOING TO INSPIRE OTHER

300
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
PEOPLE TO BECOME A DICTATOR BY

301
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
COVERING SADDAM HUSSEIN.

302
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
YOU HAVE TO COVER IT BECAUSE

303
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
IT IS LEGITIMATE NEWS, AND WE

304
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING

305
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
ON.

306
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
BUT THERE BECOMES A POINT

307
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
WHERE IT IS TABLOID AND

308
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
DISGUSTING.

309
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
THE MEDIA KNOWS WHERE THAT

310
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
LINE IS.

311
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE BEEN

312
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
TELLING THEM FOR YEARS HOW TO

313
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
COVER THIS STORY.

314
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
THEY ARE NOT NAIVE.

315
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
WE HAVE THE SAME BORING GUN

316
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
DISCUSSIONS.
>> IS IT MENTAL ILLNESS OR

317
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
GUNS?
THE MEDIA NEVER HAS A

318
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
DISCUSSION, WHAT DID WE DO TO

319
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
CONTRIBUTE?

320
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
WHEN THE SHOOTING HAPPENED IN

321
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
AURORA YOU KNEW MORE WERE

322
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
COMING.
THEY ARE GIVING THESE WORMS

323
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
WHAT THEY WANT.

324
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
THEY LET THEM GO OUT IN A

325
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
BLAZE OF GLORY, AND THE PRESS

326
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
KNOW THEY ARE DOING IT, AND

327
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
THEY DON'T CARE.

328
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
DON'T LET THEM FEIGN

329
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
IGNORANCE.
WE ARE JUST DOING OUR JOB.

330
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
THEY KNOW AND THEY ADD

331
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
ADMONISH THEMSELVES OF GUILT

332
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY CAN

333
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
HIDE BEHIND DOING THEIR JOB.

334
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
DISGUSTING.

335
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
>>> GEDS DO DYE YAW WE WILL --

336
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
JEDEDIAH WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

337
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
GUNS IN A MINUTE.

338
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I WANT TO STAY ON THIS MENTAL

339
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
HEALTH THING FOR A SECOND.
I KNOW A LITTLE ABOUT GUNS.

340
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I SAW A LOT OF FLAT OUT WRONG

341
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
INFORMATION BEING PASSED

342
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
AROUND ON TWITTER AND NEWS

343
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
REPORTS, STUFF ABOUT AUTOMATIC

344
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
WEAPONS AND PEOPLE NOT

345
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
UNDERSTANDING WHAT A

346
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPON IS

347
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
APPARENTLY.

348
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
SO TO GET BACK TO MENTAL

349
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
HEALTH, MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO

350
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT

351
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
INCLUDING US RIGHT HERE AREN'T

352
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
EXPERTS.
WE PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WHAT

353
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
THE HELL WE ARE TALKING ABOUT,

354
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
RIGHT 1234*.

355
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
>> WHEN IT COMES TO MENTAL

356
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
HEALTH YOU NEED MENTAL HEALTH

357
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
EXPERTS TO BE TALKING.

358
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
TO FOX NEWS' CREDIT YOU HAVE A

359
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
LOT OF DOCTORS ON THAT WERE

360
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
DISCUSSING THE IMPLICATIONS TO

361
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
THE FACT THIS COULD HAVE FOR

362
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
KIDS WHO SURVIVED AND HOW THE

363
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
SITUATION SHOULD BE DEALT WITH

364
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
AND HOW IT SHOULD BE EXPLAINED

365
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
TO YOUR CHILDREN IF YOU

366
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
WEREN'T INVOLVED AND WE HAD A

367
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
CROWD HAMMER ON.

368
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
IT WAS THE FIRST PERSON WHO WE

369
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
SAID WE NEED TO GET INTO THE

370
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
MINDS OF THESE PEOPLE.

371
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL

372
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
HEALTH ISSUE.

373
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
TO YOUR QUESTION BEFORE ABOUT

374
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
SCHOOLS AND HOW MUCH THEY CAN

375
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
DO, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT

376
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
THIS IN MANY CASES RESIDES

377
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
WITH PARENTS.
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

378
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
WITH THESE KIDS 24-7.

379
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

380
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
IN AN AUTHORITATIVE POSITION

381
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
WHERE THEY CAN MAKE THESE

382
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT KIND OF

383
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
HELP THEIR KIDS GET.

384
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
AT A CERTAIN POINT THE SCHOOL

385
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
DOES LEGALLY NEED TO STEP BACK

386
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
AND SAY THIS IS THE JOB OF

387
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
PARENTS.

388
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
>> I WANT TO-ON TO GUNS.

389
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
SUNDAY NIGHT'S VIGIL AND

390
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID HE WOULD
ENTER THE DEBATE IN GUN

391
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
CONTROL IN THE WEEKS TO COME.

392
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
>> NO SINGLE LAW, NO SET OF

393
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
LAWS CAN ELIMINATE EVIL FROM

394
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
THE WORLD OR PREVENT EVERY

395
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
SENSELESS ACT OF VIOLENCE IN

396
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
OUR SOCIETY, BUT THAT CAN'T BE

397
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
AN EXCUSE FOR AN ACTION.

398
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
SURELY WE CAN DO BETTER THAN

399
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
THIS.
IN THE COMING WEEKS I WILL USE

400
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE

401
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000

EFFORT AIMED AT PREVENTING

406

MORE TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS.

SECRETARY JAY CARNEY SAYS THE

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
ISSUE WILL REQUIRE A, QUOTE,

COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION, END

411

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
AND OTHER MEASURES.

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000

TOE RENEWAL OF THE BAN EXPIRED

IN 2004.

REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN NOTED

418
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY THAT

419
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
STRICTER GUN CONTROL DOES NOT

420
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT CRIME

421
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
RATES GO DOWN.

422
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
>> WASHINGTON, D.C. SHOULD BE

423
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
THE SAFEST PLACE IN AMERICA,

424
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
IT IS NOT.

425
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
IG CHICAGO SHOULD BE SAFE.

426
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
IT IS NOT.

427
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
THEIR GUN LAWS DON'T WORK.

428
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
>> AMBASSADOR ON MONDAY, THE

429
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
SENATOR WHO IS AN AVID -- I'M

430
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
SORRY, DEMOCRAT WHO IS AN AVID

431
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
HUNTER AND NRA MEMBER.

432
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
HE SAID GUN CONTROL

433
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
LEGISLATION SHOULD BE -- NEEDS

434
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
TO BE PART OF A DISCUSSION.

435
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
HAVE WE -- ARE WE SEE A SHIFT

436
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
IN THE GUN CONTROL DEBATE IN

437
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
THE TONE AT LEAST?

438
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
>> IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL.

439
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I THINK ALL OF THESE ISSUES

440
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
NEED TO BE DEBATED.

441
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
BUT MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

442
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
NOW SAYING, SEE THIS PROVES

443
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
YOU NEED STRONGER GUN CONTROL

444
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
LAWS HELD THAT POSITION BEFORE

445
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
THE NEWTOWN MASACRE AND FOR

446
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
VARIOUS THRANS HAVE NOTHING TO

447
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
DO WITH WHAT HAPPENED THERE.

448
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
IF YOU CHANGE THE EXISTING GUN

449
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
CONTROL LAWS, WOULD IT HAVE

450
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
STOPPED NEWTOWN OR AURORA?

451
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
THE ANSWER IN MOST CASES IS

452
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
NO.

453
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I THINK THAT TIES IN PART TO

454
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
THE POINT YOU MADE ABOUT

455
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
PEOPLE NOT REALLY

456
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF

457
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
THESE WEAPONS.

458
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
YOU CALL SOMETHING

459
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC.

460
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
THAT SOUNDS LIKE ALMOST

461
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
AUTOMATIC.
I HAVEN'T FIRED A

462
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
AUTOMATIC SINCE I WAS ON

463
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
ACTIVE DUTY.

464
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO TALK

465
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
ABOUT IT HAVE NEVER DONE IT.

466
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
IF YOU HAVE EVER DONE IT ONCE

467
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

468
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I THINK ALSO IT GOES TO THIS

469
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
QUESTION OF DEFENSE.

470
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
YOU CAN'T LOCK UP ALL OF THE

471
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED PEOPLE.

472
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
YOU CAN'T GET RID OF ALL OF

473
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
THE GUNS.

474
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE

475
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
POTENTIAL.

476
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
WHAT STEPS TO PROTECT THE

477
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
SCHOOLS ARE YOU TAKING?

478
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
TO DECLARE THEM GUN FREE ZONES

479
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
MEANING THE TEACHERS DON'T

480
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
HAVE GUNS AND THAT SECURITY

481
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
JUST HOPE OPS THEM -- JUST

482
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
OPENS THEM UP TO THIS KIND OF

483
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
ATTACK.

484
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
>> I WANT TO QUOTE THE SENATOR

485
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
AGAIN SAYING I DON'T KNOW

486
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
ANYBODY THAT GOES OUT WITH AN

487
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
ASSAULT RIFLE OR ANYBODY THAT

488
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
NEEDS 30 ROUNDS IN A CLIP TO

489
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
GO HUNTING.

490
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I FIND IT ODD THAT AN AVID

491
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
HUNTER WOULD CONFUSE A CLIP

492
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
AND A MAGAZINE, BUT THAT'S A

493
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
SEPARATE ISSUE.
DO YOU AGREE WITH HIM THOUGH?

494
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
DOES HE HAVE A POINT?

495
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
>> YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND

496
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
THAT ADAM LANZA TRIED TO BUY A

497
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
LEGAL GUN AND WAS DENIED.

498
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
HE REFUSED THE BACK GROUND

499
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
CHECK.

500
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
HE REFUSED TO GO IN THE

501
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
WAITING PERIOD.

502
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
HE DIDN'T GET A LEGAL GUN.

503
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
450E STOLE SOMEBODY ELSE'S

504
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
GUN.

505
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
THE GUN CONTROL LAW THAT

506
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
PREVENTED HIM FROM GETTING A

507
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
LEGAL GUN WORKED.

508
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
WHAT DIDN'T WORK WAS THE FACT

509
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
THAT HE STOLE SOMEBODY ELSE'S

510
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
GUN.

511
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO

512
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
ABOUT THAT.
IF A CRAZY PERSON WILL STEEL

513
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
SOMEBODY ELSE'S GUN, ODDS ARE

514
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
THEY WILL GET IT.

515
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
AND THE SCHOOL RKS GUN FREE

516
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
ZONE.
ALL OF THESE PLACES, THE WILL

517
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
MAS, THE MOVIE THEATERS THESE

518
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
PEOPLE GO TO ARE GUN FREE

519
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
ZONES FOR A REASON.

520
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
THEY KNOW PEOPLE WON'T BE

521
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
ARMED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.

522
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
>> YOU COULD ARGUE THAT IF HIS

523
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
MOTHER HADN'T BEEN ALLOWED TO

524
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
PURCHASE THE GUN HE WOULDN'T

525
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STEEL IT

526
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
FROM HER.

527
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
>> YOU COULD, BUT THAT'S LIKE

528
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
SAYING EVERY PERSON WHO IS A

529
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
LAW ABIDING CITIZEN HAS TO BE

530
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
PUNISHED AND CAN'T PROTECT

531
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
THEMSELVES BECAUSE SOMEONE

532
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
ELSE WHO ISN'T A LAW ABIDING

533
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
CITIZEN MAY DECIDE TO STEAL

534
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
THEIR STUFF.
>> ISN'T THAT GUN CONTROL?

535
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
>>-
>> SHOULD HIS MOTHER BE MORE

536
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
CAREFUL WITH SOMEBODY IN THE

537
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
HOUSE, WE DON'T KNOW.

538
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SAFETY

539
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
PRECAUTIONS THERE WERE TO KEEP

540
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
THE GUNS OUT OF HIS HAND.

541
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING

542
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
IN TERMS OF THE FAMILY

543
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
DYNAMIC.
I WOULD ARGUE, YES, IF YOU

544
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
HAVE A CHILD WITH MENTAL

545
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
ISSUES WHO IS TEETERING ON THE

546
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
EDGE AND YOU HAVE GUNS IN THE

547
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
HOUSEHOLD, IT IS YOUR

548
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE

549
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
THE GUNS ARE PROTECTED.

550
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA THAT

551
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
SCHOOL OFFICIALS SHOULD BE

552
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
ARMED?

553
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS

554
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
NOW.

555
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
IS THIS OVERREACTING?

556
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
THE FACT IS SCHOOLS ARE AMONG

557
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
SAFEST PLACES FOR KIDS.

558
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
>> IF YOU ARM THE SCHOOL

559
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
OFFICIALS, ONE OF THEM IS

560
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
GOING TO SNAP.

561
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
OH WE HAVE TO ARM THE

562
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
CAFETERIA LADIES.

563
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

564
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
WHO EVER HAS IT, IF ONE OF

565
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
THAT GROUP SNAPS PEOPLE SAY OH

566
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
MY GOD.
IT IS LIKE NOTHING -- IT

567
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
DOESN'T CHANGE ANYBODY'S

568
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
OPINION.
WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS

569
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
HAPPENS, PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY,

570
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
VERY FOR GUNS IT STRENGTHENS

571
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
THEIR OPINIONS.

572
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
IF I TWHRAS WITH MY GUN I

573
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
WOULD HAVE STOPPED IT.

574
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
PEOPLE ANTI-GUNS SAY LOOK SEE

575
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
WHAT HAPPENS.
IT IS A TALKING POINT PEOPLE

576
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
USE TO STRENGTHEN THEIR SIDE

577
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
OF THE ARGUMENT.

578
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
IT CHANGES NOTHING.

579
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
>> IN THE CASE OF THE SCHOOL

580
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
ATTACK THE PRINCIPAL AND OTHER

581
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
TEACHERS VERY COURAGEOUSLY

582
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
WENT TOWARD THE GUNMAN IN AN

583
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
EFFORT TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN

584
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
AND DIED AS A RESULT OF THEIR

585
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
COURAGE.
HAD THEY HAD WEAPONS WOULD THE

586
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
RESULT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT?

587
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE IT COULD

588
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN

589
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
26-YEAR-OLDS BEING KILLED.

590
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I THINK THE POSSIBILITY WITH

591
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
TRAINING AND WITH SUPERVISION

592
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I THINK WOULD POSSIBLY DETER

593
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
PEOPLE LIKE THE NEWTOWN.

594
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
>> DO WE REQUIRE THAT

595
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
PRINCIPALS AND TEACHERS GET

596
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
GUN SAFETY TRAINING?

597
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK THIS OUGHT TO BE PART

598
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
OF THE DEBATE.

599
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
THE NOTION OF THE GUN FREE
ZONE ZONE -- MAYBE YOU DON'T

600
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
WANT YOUR STUDENTS TO HAVE

601
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
GUNS, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

602
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
YOU DON'T WANT SOME SYSTEM OF

603
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
SECURITY GUARD FOR EXAMPLE TO

604
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
PROTECT THE STUDENTS.

605
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
THIS LANZA COMMITTED SUICIDE

606
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
WHEN HE KNEW THE POLICE HAD

607
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
ARRIVED.

608
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
WHY?
THEY WERE THE PEOPLE WITH THE

609
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
GUNS.
THAT'S WHAT HE FEARED.

610
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
>> FROM YOU A COP OR MILITARY

611
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
GUY --
>> ARE YOU TALKING AN AIR

612
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
MARTIAL SYSTEM?

613
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
>> SOMEBODY THERE WHO IS USED

614
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
TO -- EVEN A TEACHER WITH A

615
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
GUN AND BEING WELL

616
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
INTENTIONED, BEING TRAINED
WITH A GUN IS ONE THING, BUT

617
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
RUNNING IN WHEN THERE IS A

618
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
MANIAC FIRING IS TOTALLY

619
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
DIFFERENT.

620
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
>> COULD NOT AGREE MORE.

621
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
BILL, I SAW A QUOTE THAT SAID

622
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE

623
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
EQUIVALENT OF SCHOOLS THAT

624
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
9/11 WAS FOR AIRPORTS.

625
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
IS THAT WHAT WE WANT?

626
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
DO WE WANT THE EQUIVALENT OF A

627
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
TSA IN SCHOOLS?

628
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
>> WHAT MORE CAN THEY DO AT
THIS POINT?

629
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I CAN'T SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO

630
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
WHAT THE SCHOOL WAS DOING, BUT

631
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
WEREN'T THEY AT THE TOP OF THE
LIST WHEN IT COMES TO SAFE

632
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
SCHOOLS?

633
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
THEY HAD LOCKED DOORS AND ALL

634
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
KINDS OF SECURITY PROVISIONS.

635
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
HE STORMED HIS WAY IN.

636
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
AT THIS POINT IF IT IS GOING

637
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
TO HAPPEN, IT IS GOING TO

638
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
HAPPEN.

639
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
THE THING I HAVE SEEN A LITTLE

640
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
BIT OF HERE IS I DON'T

641
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
UNDERSTAND WHEN PEOPLE START

642
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
EQUATING GUN CONTROL WITH

643
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
BANNING GUNS.
THAT ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE THE

644
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
PARALLEL I SEE MADE.

645
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
ONE IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

646
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
FROM THE OTHER.
YOU FIND A LOT OF GUN OWNERS

647
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
ARE COMPLETELY FOR COMMON

648
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
SENSE MOVEMENTS THAT INVOLVE

649
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
GUN CONTROL.

650
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
IT SEEMS THE ARGUMENT STOPS

651
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
WHEN YOU MENTION THE WORDS

652
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
BECAUSE THAT IMMEDIATELY

653
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
EQUATES BACK, BACK, SECOND --

654
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
BAM, BAM, SECOND AMENDMENT.

655
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
HE DID A POLL AND HE ASKED THE

656
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
GUN OWNERS, NONNRA GUN OWNS

657
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
AND NRA GUN OWNERS IF THERE

658
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
SHOULD BE A REQUIRED

659
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
BACKGROUND CHECK ON OWNERS AND

660
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
EMPLOYEES.

661
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
MOST SAID YES.

662
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
CONCEALED CARRY PERMITS SHOULD

663
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
ONLY BE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO

664
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
COMPLETED A SAFETY COURSE.

665
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
MOST SAID YES.

666
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
THERE IS A CONSENSUS HERE.

667
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
WHAT YOU DON'T HEAR ARE THESE

668
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
PEOPLE.

669
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
YOU HEAR THE REPRESENTATIVES

670
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
OF THE NRA AND FAR RIGHT

671
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
POLITICAL STRATEGISTS,

672
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

673
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
ON TV DOING THEIR AGENDA.

674
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

675
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
THERE ARE LESS PEOPLE BUYING

676
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
GUNS NOW.
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE BUYING A

677
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
LOT OF GUNS, BUT GUN OWNERSHIP

678
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
IN HOUSEHOLDS HAS GONE DOWN

679
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
BIG TIME.

680
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
THEY HAVE TO KEEP THE NUMBERS

681
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
UP JIE. LET ME TAKE THE OTHER

682
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
SIDE OF THIS.
THIS IS SOMETHING I SAW OVER

683
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
THE WEEKEND ON TV OR TWITTER,

684
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE SAYING WE

685
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ON

686
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
GUN CONTROL.

687
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
IT IS TIME FOR A CONVERSATION.

688
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
BY ALL MEANS, LET'S HAVE A

689
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
CONVERSATION.

690
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
BUT MOST OF THESE PEOPLE DON'T

691
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
WANT A CONVERSATION.

692
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
A CONVERSATION REQUIRES

693
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
LISTENING TO PEOPLE WHO

694
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
DISAGREE WITH YOU.

695
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
AND IT IS STARTING FROM THE

696
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
PREMISE THAT BOTH SIDES ARE

697
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
COMING FROM BOOTH FAITH.

698
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
-- COMING FROM GOOD FAITH.

699
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
THEY DON'T WANT A

700
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
CONVERSATION.
THEY WANT GUN CONTROL.

701
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
>> THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT

702
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
WHAT THEY FEEL.

703
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE STATS

704
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE

705
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
COUNTRY, THE STATES, THE

706
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
CITIES, IT IS PLACES WITH THE

707
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
STRICTEST GUN CONTROL LAWS

708
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
HAVE THE HIGHEST CRIME

709
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
LEVELS.

710
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
IT IS A DETERRENT FOR

711
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
CRIMINALS.

712
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
THINK ABOUT IT.

713
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
IF YOU HAD A SECURITY GUARD

714
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
PROTECTING YOU ALL DAY AND I

715
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
THREW THIS OUT TO PIERCE

716
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
MORGAN OR ONE OF THE MEDIA

717
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
FOLKS WOULD YOU WANT THEM

718
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
ARMED?

719
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I WOULD IF I WAS OUT THERE AND

720
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
A HIGH PROFILE FIGURE I WOULD

721
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
WANT MY SECURITY TEAM ARMED.

722
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
IT MAKES NO SENSE.

723
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
>> WE HAVE TO MOVE ON.

724
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
A BIG THING GOING IS EVERYONE

725
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
SAYS IN THE WAKE OF THIS WE
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING, DO

726
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
SOMETHING.

727
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I AM OPPOSED TO CALLING FOR

728
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
LEGISLATION AND PASSING

729
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
LEGISLATION IN THE HEAT OF THE

730
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
MOMENT WHEN EMOTIONS ARE

731
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
HIGH.
TO ME THAT'S HOW YOU END UP

732
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
WITH THINGS LIKE THE PATRIOT

733
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
ACT WHICH END UP HAVING A LOT

734
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OR

735
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
INTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT

736
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
PEOPLE DIDN'T QUITE REALIZE
WHEN THEY WERE VOTING FOR IT.

737
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
HAVE A CONVERSATION,

738
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
ABSOLUTELY.

739
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
WE DON'T NEED TO PASS ANYTHING

740
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
IN THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS OR

741
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

742
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
COMING UP, A DIFFERENT STORY,

743
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
SOMETHING ABOUT FOOTBALL

744
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
PERHAPS.
YOU ARE WATCHING "RED EYE" ON

745
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
FNC.
STICK AROUND.

746
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
>>> IS IT CORNY IF RG3 LIKES

747
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
THE GSP?

748
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
THEY SUSPENDED ROB PARKER FOR

749
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
CALLING ROBERT GRIFFIN THE

750
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
THIRD A CORN BROTHER AND

751
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
SAYING HE SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED

752
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
ON THE BASIS OF RACE.

753
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
>> MY QUESTION WHICH IS A

754
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
STRAIGHT, HONEST QUESTION, IS

755
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
HE A BROTHER OR A CORNWALL

756
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
BROTHER?
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

757
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
>> HE DOES THE THING, BUT SHE

758
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
NOT REALLY DOWN WITH THE

759
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
CAUSE.
HE IS NOT ONE OF US.

760
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
WE KNOW HE IS A REPUBLICAN AND

761
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
THERE IS NO INFORMATION AT

762
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
ALL.
I AM JUST TRYING TO DIG DEEPER

763
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
INTO WHY HE HAS AN ISSUE.

764
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
>> HERE IS STEVEN A SMITH

765
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
SUMMING UP THE SEGMENT

766
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
NICELY.

767
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
>> I AM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH

768
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
WHERE WE JUST WENT.

769
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
>> AND WHILE THE NETWORK

770
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
CONDUCTS A FULL REVIEW

771
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
WHATEVER THAT MEANS, PARKER

772
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
HAS CHASTISED CRITICS ON

773
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
TWITTER BY CALLING THEM,

774
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
QUOTE, UNEDUCATED.

775
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
THERE IS A BURN NOTICE IF I

776
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
EVER HEARD ONE.

777
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
AS FOR SANTA PAWS, STILL HATES

778
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
THE HOLIDAYS.

779
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS GETS MORE

780
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
AND MORE VIOLENT.

781
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
JIM, I AM GUESSING REGARDLESS

782
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
OF WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT PARK

783
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
PARKER'S COMMENTS HE SHOULD

784
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
NOT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED.

785
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
>> I AM QUIET ON THIS ONE.

786
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I TYPICALLY HATE SEEING PEOPLE

787
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
SUSPENDED FOR EXPRESSING

788
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THEMSELVES.
BUT IF IT WAS A WHITE

789
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
COMMENTATOR SAYING THAT HE

790
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
WOULD BE SUSPENDED.

791
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
FIRST OF ALL HIS HEAD IS AWFUL

792
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
TO LOOK AT.

793
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I THOUGHT I HAD A MISS SHAPEN

794
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
HEAD.

795
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
THERE IS NOTHING MORE BORING

796
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
THAN WATCHING A GUY QUESTION

797
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
ANOTHER GUY'S RACIAL

798
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
ALLEGIANCE OR QUALIFICATION

799
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
IN, WHAT, 1970s THINK ?G HE

800
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
IS NOT BROTHER ENOUGH?

801
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
HE IS MARRIED TO A HONKEY?

802
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
>> LIKE THE JEFFERSONS.

803
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS

804
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
LIKE.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE A GUY

805
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
FIRED ON THIS, BUT I HOPE HE

806
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
IS FIRED FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

807
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
>> THIS STEMS FROM RG3 SAYING,

808
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO BE

809
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
DEFINED AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN

810
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
QUARTERBACK.

811
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
ISN'T THAT COMMON SENSE?

812
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
WOULD YOU RATHER BE KNOWN AS A

813
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
GREAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN

814
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
QUARTERBACK OR A GREAT

815
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
QUARTERBACK.

816
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
>> THIS IS A CRITICAL POINT

817
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
WHERE OUR SOCIETY HAS REVERSED

818
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
WHERE WE STARTED OUT IN THE

819
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

820
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
IT WAS MARTIN LUTHER KING WHO

821
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
SAID "I LOOK FORWARD TO A DAY

822
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
WHEN PEOPLE ARE JUDGED BY THE

823
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
CONTENT OF THEIR CHARACTER AND

824
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
NOT THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN."

825
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
THEY OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T GET THE

826
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
MEMO AT ESPN.

827
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
UNFORTUNATELY IT IS TRUE
ACROSS THE BOARD.

828
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
THAT'S HOW WE CAMPAIGN IN

829
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
POLITICS.

830
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
AT LEAST THAT'S HOW THE OBAMA

831
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
CAMPAIGN WORKED.

832
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
YOU TARGET ETHNIC GROUPS,

833
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
RELIGIONS ON THE BASIS OF

834
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
GENDER.
YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT ISSUES.

835
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I THINK IT IS DEMEANING.

836
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I THINK PEOPLE ARE MULTI

837
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
DIMENSIONAL.

838
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
WHEN YOU TRY AND PIGEON HOLE

839
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
SOMEBODY AS THE BLACK GUY OR

840
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
THE WOMAN, YOU ARE GOING IN

841
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
THE WRONG DIRECTION.

842
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
>> JED JEDEDIAH, RG3 HAS

843
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
AMAZING LEGS AND ARM AND HE

844
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
WILL BE REMEMBERED LONG AFTER

845
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
ROB PARKER IS FORGOTTEN.

846
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
>> OH YES.

847
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
THIS GUY IS ALREADY OLD NEWS.

848
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT HIM.

849
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
YOU KNOW, THIS GUY SAID

850
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
SOMETHING STUPID, PARKER.

851
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
YOU HAVE TO BE HELD

852
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT YOU SAY.

853
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
AS I RECALL I THINK RUSH

854
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
LIMBAUGH SAID SOMETHING THAT

855
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
HAD RACIAL UNDERTONES YEARS

856
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
AGO ON ESPN, AND HE WAS FORCED

857
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
TO RESIGN.
I THINK ESPN WAS IN A TOUGH

858
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
SITUATION.
IF YOU ARE GOING TO HOLD

859
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE YOU HAVE TO

860
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
DO IT ACROSS THE BOARD AND

861
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY.

862
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
>> LAST WORD TO YOU, QUICK.

863
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
>> I THINK RUSH LIMBAUGH

864
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
OFFENDED ALL BLACK PEOPLE.

865
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
THIS JUST OFFENDED CORN BALL

866
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
ONES.

867
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
THE FUNNY PART WAS ROB PARKER

868
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
GAVE HIM STREET CREDS.

869
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I THINK HE IS NOT TRYING TO

870
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
LOOK LIKE A SURFER.

871
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
FAVORITE GROUP IS THE BEACH

872
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
BOYS, FACT.

873
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
>> DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON

874
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000

>> YES, YOU ARE.

894
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I GOT THAT RIGHT.

895
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH DISCUSSION

896
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
AT THE BEGINNING.
JIM NORTON, YOU SAID YOU DON'T

897
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
CARE TO ASK, AND YOU KIND

898
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
OF -- YOU GAVE IT A LITTLE

899
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
VOICE SAYING WHO DID THE

900
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
KILLER KILL?
THIS IS WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN

901
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
HEARING ALL THE TIME.

902
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
WHY DID THE KILLER -- YOU ARE

903
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
SICK OF HEARING PEOPLE SAY WHY

904
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
DID THE KILLER KILL?

905
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
BUT IF THE ANSWER TO THAT

906
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
LEADS TO SOME KIND OF INITTER

907
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
VEPTION, VEPTION -- KIND OF

908
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
INTERVENTION COULD IT BE

909
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
AVAILABLE?
>> SURE, BUT IT TENDS TO LEAD

910
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
TO MORE MEDIA COVERAGE.

911
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
IT IS STAGE 3 OF THEM

912
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
PROSTITUTING A STORY, IS THIS

913
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
FEIGN INTEREST WHY DID THE

914
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
AURORA KILLER AND THEN THEY

915
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
CALL IT WHY DID THE JOKER

916
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
KILL?
AND I AM NEVER CONCERNED WITH

917
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
THE MOTIVES OF A SOCIOPATH.

918
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
IT IS NEVER GOING TO MAKE

919
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
SENSE.

920
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
THEY ARE NOT SO CRAZY THEY

921
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE

922
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
DOING.
HE PLANED IT AND SHOT HIMSELF

923
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
WHEN THE COPS ARE COMING.

924
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
HE KNEW THE CONSEQUENCES.

925
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
YOU ARE NEVER GO BE TO FIND AN

926
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
ANSWER THAT MAKES IT LESS

927
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
RANDOM AND LESS FRIGHTENING.

928
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
>> THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE.

929
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
WASN'T IT THE MOVIE THEATER

930
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
SHOOTER WHO WAS DRESSED LIKE A

931
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
SUPER VILLAIN?
>> YES.

932
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
OR GABBY GIFFORDS, THE GUY WHO

933
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
SHOT HER ISN'T THERE EVER GO

934
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
BE TO BE A TIME WHERE WE SAY

935
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
OH OKAY THAT MAKES SENSE.

936
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
NO, IT NEVER MAKES SENSE.

937
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
>> JEDEDIAH, YOU RESPONDED

938
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
SAYING THIS IS THE JOB OF A

939
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
PSYCHOLOGIST TO FIGURE OUT

940
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
WHAT MAKES THESE PEOPLE TICK.

941
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THE QUESTION IS, IF WE DO FIND

942
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
A WAY TO ISOLATE THESE PEOPLE,

943
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
ISN'T THE ISSUE REALLY LESS

944
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY AND MORE

945
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
ABOUT THE WILLINGNESS TO FORCE

946
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
THESE PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT?

947
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
WE DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO

948
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
DO.

949
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
>> IF IT IS A MINOR YOU HAVE

950
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
TO DEAL WITH THE PARENTS AND

951
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
WORK WITH THEM.
THE IDEA IS TO FIGURE OUT IF

952
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
THESE PEOPLE ARE DANGEROUS

953
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
BEFORE THEY BECOME DANGEROUS

954
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
AND TO MONITOR.

955
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
LIKE I SAID IF THEY ARE ON

956
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
MEDICATIONS AND UNDER
TREATMENT AND TO MAKE SURE IF

957
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE

958
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
LIVING WITH PARENTS OR HAVE

959
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
CLOSE RELATIVES THAT THERE IS

960
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
SOMEONE INVOLVED IN THE

961
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
SITUATION WHO IS AWARE OF THE

962
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
SEVERITY OF IT AND MONITORING

963
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
IT.
A LOT GOES UNMONITORED.

964
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
AND THEN IT IS TOO LATE.

965
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
WE LOOK AT THE NEWS STORIES

966
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
AND WE SEE THERE WERE ALL OF

967
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
THESE WARNING SIGNS, WHY

968
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
DIDN'T ANYONE DO ANYTHING

969
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
ABOUT IT?

970
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
MAYBE ENOUGH PEOPLE KNEW WHAT

971
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
WAS GOING.
>> YOU WERE A TEACHER, AM I

972
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
RIGHT?
>> I WAS A TEACHER AND A DEAN

973
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
AND AN ADVISOR.

974
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
>> THEY TALK ABOUT ARMING

975
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
PRINCIPALS.
DO YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE IN

976
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
ADMINISTRATION WHO ARE WILLING

977
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
TO WALK AROUND ARMED?

978
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT IS

979
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
THE CULTURE THAT ACCEPTS THIS

980
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
CHARACTER.
>> IT DEPENDS ON WHERE IT IS.

981
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
IN TEXAS MAYBE.

982
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
IN NEW YORK CITY PROBABLY

983
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
NOT.

984
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THAT JUST

985
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT DIFFICULT

986
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
SCHOOLS LOOK LIKE WHERE THERE

987
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
ARE VERY TOUGH KIDS.

988
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I KNOW THERE IS TENSION IN

989
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
CLASSROOMS ALL OF THE TIME.

990
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I WOULD BE A LITTLE WORRIED

991
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
ABOUT THE TEACHER BEING

992
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
WORRIED WHERE THE WEAPON WAS.

993
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
ALL OF THAT WORRIES ME.

994
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I SUPPORT SECURITY AT SCHOOL.

995
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
IF YOU HAD A TRAINED

996
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
PROFESSIONAL WHO WAS VISIBLE
TO THE PUBLIC OUTSIDE AND IN

997
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
AND OUT.

998
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
IT WAS KNOWN AS A GROUND THAT

999
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
WAS PROTECTED BY SOMEONE WHO

1000
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
WAS ARMED THAT COULD MAKE A

1001
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
WORLD OF DIFFERENCE.

1002
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
>> CERTAINLY PEOPLE ARE

1003
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
COMFORTABLE IN OTHER

1004
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
COUNTRIES.
SOMETIMES THERE ARE GUYS WITH

1005
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
MACHINE GUNS OUTSIDE HOTELS.

1006
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
>> AND GUESS WHAT, THE PEOPLE

1007
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
IN THAT HOTEL ARE WELL

1008
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
PROTECTED.
NO ONE IS GOING IN THERE TO

1009
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
BOTHER THEM.
>> THAT'S THE TIME I FELT SAFE

1010
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
IN MY HOTEL.
>> I HATE TO TELL YOU HOW TO

1011
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
DO YOUR JOB, BUT WE ARE

1012
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
BURYING THE LEAD.

1013
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
HOW COME NO TEACHER WE EVER

1014
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
HAD LOOKED LIKE JEDEDIAH.

1015
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
>> I HAD A MALE TEACHER WHO

1016
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
WORE THAT DRESS.

1017
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
>> THAT'S WHY THEY PUT HER IN

1018
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
THE FRONT OFFICE.

1019
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
>> I DID HAVE A LOT OF

1020
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
TROUBLESOME MALE STUDENTS.

1021
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
>> YOU BROUGHT UP A GOOD

1022
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
EXAMPLE WHEN YOU SAID WE DON'T

1023
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
BROADCAST TERRORIST DEMANDS.

1024
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

1025
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
MEDIA.
EXACTLY.

1026
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
WE DON'T READ THE RANSOM

1027
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
NOTES.

1028
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
IT GLORIFIES THE TERRORISTS OR

1029
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
THE CRIMINALS, HOSTAGE TAKERS,

1030
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
WHATEVER.

1031
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I THINK IT WAS BILL WHO SAID

1032
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
THE RAPE CASES, THEY DON'T

1033
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
MENTION THE NAME OF THE

1034
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
VICTIM.

1035
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
THE MEDIA IS CONSTANTLY

1036
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
SELF-CENSORING THEMSELVES.
BUT FOR SOME REASON THEY THINK

1037
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
IN TERMS OF IN THESE CASES OF

1038
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
VIOLENT SHOOTINGS THEY CAN'T

1039
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
SENSOR THEMSELVES.

1040
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
BILL'S EXAMPLE OF THE RAPE

1041
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
VICTIM MY EXAMPLE WHEN A MINOR

1042
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
KILLS THEIR MOTHER, A

1043
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
13-YEAR-OLD, THEY DON'T PUT
HIS NAME ON THE NEWS.

1044
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
JIM NORTON GAVE ME A GOOD

1045
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
EXAMPLE.
IT WAS A PERFECT EXAMPLE WHEN

1046
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
A FAN RUNS OUT ON TO THE

1047
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
FIELD, THESE SPORTS COVERAGE,

1048
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
THEY DON'T FOLLOW HIM ON THE

1049
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
FIELD.

1050
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
>> I WAS FEELING LEFT OUT.

1051
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
>> IT SEEMS FRIVOLOUS, BUT IT

1052
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE.

1053
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
MEDIA SENSORS THEMSELVES AND

1054
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
WHY NOT, ANDY, IN A CASE LIKE

1055
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
THIS.

1056
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
>> I AM STILL NOT SURE WHAT

1057
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
EXACTLY YOU WANT.

1058
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
DO YOU WANT NO COVERAGE OF

1059
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
THIS EVENT?

1060
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
WE COVER TERRORIST EVENTS -- --.

1061
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
>> LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN

1062
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
SINCE FRIDAY.

1063
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
IT HAS BEEN WALL TO WALL

1064
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
COVERAGE.

1065
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
HOUR AFTER HOUR AFTER HOUR.

1066
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I THINK IT IS THAT EXCESSIVE

1067
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
COVERAGE THAT COULD HAVE AN

1068
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
AFFECT ON OTHER EMOTIONALLY

1069
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
DISTURBED PEOPLE TO SAY TO

1070
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
THEM, YOU CAN GET FOUR DAYS OF

1071
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
BEING THE CENTER OF ATTENTION

1072
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
OF THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES.

1073
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
THAT'S BAD.

1074
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
>> LET ME TELL YOU THIS.

1075
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
IF YOU STOP COVERAGE IN THE

1076
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
FIRST FOUR DAYS, THEN YOU ARE

1077
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
GOING TO GET YELLED AT FROM

1078
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
PEOPLE SAYING WHY ARE YOU

1079
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
COVERING X WHILE THIS IS GOING

1080
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
ON.

1081
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
>> I THINK IF THERE WAS A

1082
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
PRINCIPAL THROUGHOUT THE MEDIA

1083
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD -- WE

1084
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
UNDERSTAND WHEN WE HEAR THERE

1085
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
WAS RAPE VICTIM AND WE DON'T

1086
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
ANNOUNCE HER NAME WE ARE ALL

1087
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
FAMILIAR WITH THE PRACTICE.

1088
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I STILL REMEMBER THIS GUY'S

1089
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
NAME.

1090
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
WHY DO I REMEMBER DILLON

1091
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
KLEEBOLD'S NAME?

1092
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I REMEMBER THAT AS BEING

1093
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
PARTICULARLY EXCESSIVE.

1094
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
WE MAY BE APPROACHING IT IN

1095
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
THIS CASE IN MY OPINION.

1096
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
JAY TOM, --

1097
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
>> TOM, HOW DOUDA FINE THE

1098
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
MEDIA?
IS THE MEDIA FOX NEWS?

1099
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
IS THE MEDIA NOT TWITTER OR

1100
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
THE INTERNET?
YOU ARE STILL GOING TO GET

1101
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
COVERAGE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

1102
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
NEWS NETWORKS AND NEWS

1103
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD NOT COVER

1104
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
THIS, BUT IT IS STILL GOING TO

1105
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
BE COVERED.

1106
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
HIS NAME WILL BE OUT THERE.

1107
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
IT IS GOING TO BE CIRCULATING

1108
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
ALL OVER THE PLACE WHETHER WE

1109
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
COVER IT OR NOT.

1110
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I AM OPPOSED TO LOOKING AT

1111
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
THIS GUY'S FACE AND PROJECTED

1112
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
ON A BIG SCREEN AND SEEING HIS

1113
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
NAME.

1114
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
IT IS INTERESTING YOU
MENTIONED TWITTER.

1115
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE

TWITTER HASH TAG, THE INNED

COULD OF THINGS THAT ARE

1118
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000

1120
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
TWITTER.

1121
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I SEE I REMEMBER NEWTOWN AND

1122
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
SANDY HOOKS.

1123
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
IT IS INTERESTING.
MAYBE I CAN ASK ONE OTHER

1124
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
QUESTION OF JEDEDIAH AND THIS

1125
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
IS FOR MY OWN PURPOSES.

1126
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
PEOPLE WERE GIVING ALL SORTS

1127
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
OF ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO TALK TO

1128
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
YOUR CHILDREN ABOUT THIS.

1129
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I WAS HOPING MY KIDS WEREN'T

1130
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
TALKING ABOUT THIS IN SCHOOL.

1131
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I DIDN'T BRING IT UP WITH THEM

1132
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
OVER THE WEEKEND.

1133
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I DON'T KNOW IF SITTING DOWN

1134
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
AND TALKING TO LITTLE KIDS

1135
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
ABOUT THIS -- I JUST TURNED

1136
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
THE NEWS OFF.

1137
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BE

1138
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
TALKING ABOUT IT IN A FIRST OR

1139
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
SECOND GRADE CLASSROOM?

1140
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT A FIRST

1141
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
OR SECOND GRADE CLASSROOM, BUT

1142
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
THE PROBLEM IS KIDS WILL ASK

1143
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
QUESTIONS.

1144
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
TV'S ARE ON AND KIDS ARE

1145
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
COMING HOME FROM POOL AND AND

1146
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
DOING THEIR HOMEWORK AT THE

1147
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
KITCHEN TABLE AND MOM AND DAD

1148
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
ARE WATCHING THIS.

1149
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
THEY ARE GOING TO ASK

1150
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
QUESTIONS.

1151
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO

1152
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
DEAL WITH IT.

1153
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
IF KIDS ARE FRIGHTENED --

1154
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
SOMETIMES KIDS ARE MORE

1155
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
FRIGHTENED WHEN YOU DON'T GIVE

1156
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
THEM REAL ANSWERS.

1157
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
THEY ARE VARY ACCEPT TIFF TO

1158
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
THAT.
THEY ARE RECEPTIVE TO TRUTH.

1159
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS IT IF YOUR

1160
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
KIDS HAVE QUESTIONS.

1161
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I WOULDN'T GO OUT OF MY WAY TO

1162
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
BRING IT UP IF YOUR KIDS HAVE

1163
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
BEEN UNTOUCHED BY THIS.

1164
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
BUT IF THEY DO HAVE QUESTIONS

1165
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
YOU SHOULD BE PREPARED TO HAVE

1166
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
ANSWERS.

1167
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
>> WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

1168
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
TALKING ABOUT THE SHOOTING.

1169
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I GUESS WE CAN JUST GO TO THE

1170
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
AS A "STAR WARS" EXPERT ON THE

1297
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
PANEL, BILL, I'M SURE YOU KNOW

1298
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
ENOUGH ABOUT CONSTRUCTING A

1299
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
DEATH STAR.

1300
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
HOW MANY JOBS DO WE LOOK AT

1301
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
CREATING?

1302
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
>> 32.
BUT THE THING WE HAVE TO DO IS

1303
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
LEARN FROM OUR PREDECESSORS.

1304
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
IF WE ARE TO MAKE A DEATH

1305
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
STAR, WE CANNOT HAVE SOME SORT

1306
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
OF EXPLOSIVE DEVICE IN A VERY

1307
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
SMALL AREA WE CAN EASILY LOCK

1308
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
DOWN THE PROTECTIVE SPHERE,

1309
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
AND ALL IT TAKES IS TWO WELL

1310
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
AIMED SHOTS TO EXPLODE THE

1311
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
WHOLE THING.
THAT CANNOT HAPPEN.

1312
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
YOU WERE TELLING ME SOMETHING

1313
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
SIMILAR WHEN I BUMPED INTO YOU

1314
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
AND YOUR GROUP WHEN YOU WERE

1315
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
SINGING OVER A TRASHCAN WITH A

1316
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
FIRE ON IT.

1317
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
>> CAN WE SAY IF NOTHING ELSE

1318
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
WE NEED TO BUILD THIS THING

1319
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
QUICKLY.

1320
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
WHEN IT OPENS OR LAUNCHES DICK

1321
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
CHENEY CAN BE THE ONE THAT

1322
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
SAYS NOW WITNESS THE FIRE

1323
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
POWER.
THIS HAS TO BE DONE REQUEST I

1324
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
CANLY, PEOPLE.

1325
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
>> ONLY IF I COULD INTRODUCE

1326
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
HIM.

1327
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1328
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
ABSOLUTELY.

1329
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
>> THERE ARE A THOUSAND VOICES

1330
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
THAT CRIED OUT.

1331
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
>> WE NEED THE DEATH STAR

1332
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
FILLED.
>> MY FRIEND IS THE BLUE

1333
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
ELEPHANT AND HE HAS NO WHERE

1334
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
TO WORK.

1335
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
>> I KNOW IT IS PURPLE WITH

1336
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
THREE LONG EARS.

1337
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
>> TIME TO TAKE A BREAK.

1338
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
OH WHEN WE RETURN A

1339
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
PERFORMANCE FROM TONIGHT'S

1340
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
MUSICAL GUEST.

1341
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
>>> WE ARE NEARING THE END OF

1342
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
2012, AND THAT MEANS IT IS

1343
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
TIME FOR "RED EYE"'S YEAR IN

1344
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
KITTEN WHERE WE LOOK BACK AT

1345
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
ALL THAT IS CAT.

1346
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
AS ALWAYS, PLEASE HOLD YOUR

1347
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
APPLAUSE UNTIL THE END.

1348
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
>> NO ONE EVER HOLDS THEIR

1349
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
APPLAUSE UNTIL THE END.

1350
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
ANNOYING.

1351
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
AMBASSADOR, ANYTHING TO ADD TO

1352
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
THAT?
>> WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY ADD

1353
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
TO THAT?

1354
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
JEDEDIAH?

1355
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
>> THE MOST AMAZING THING I

1356
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.

1357
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
>> WE WERE ALL WATCHING

1358
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
JEDEDIAH WATCH THAT.

1359
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
THAT WAS MORE ENTERTAINING.

1360
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
>> YOU MISSED SOME CRYING AND

1361
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
SOME LAUGHING.

1362
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
>> IT MAKES YOU WANT TO GO UP

1363
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
TO A CAT AND DO THIS TO ITS

1364
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
CHIN.
THEY LOVE THAT.

1365
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
>> IT MAKES YOU WANT TO BE

1366
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
ONE.

1367
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
>> IT WILL STOP A CAT IN ITS

1368
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
TRACKS.

1369
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
>> ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ANYTHING

1370
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
TO SAY ABOUT THAT?

1371
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
>> I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO

1372
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
SCRATCH ONE UNDER THE CHIN.

1373
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
CAN I SECOND WHAT JIM SAID?

1374
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
>> HOW MANY OF THOSE CATS LIVE

1375
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
WITH YOU?

1376
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
>> NOT A ONE.

1377
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
>> REALLY?
>> NO.

1378
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I DON'T REALLY HAVE CATS.

1379
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
>> IT IS ALL PART OF MY TV

1380
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
PERSONA.

1381
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
>> ALL OF THE CAT VIDEOS WERE

1382
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
NOT SUBJECT TO TV.

1383
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
>> WE GOT A CAT WHEN I WAS

1384
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
FIVE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A

1385
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
GIRL SO I NAMED HIM SUSAN.

1386
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
BUT THEN I WAS TOLD IT WAS A

1387
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
BOY.
SO I NAMED HIM JOHN.

1388
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
A VERY SPECIAL "RED EYE."

1389
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

1390
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
>> WE SHOULD ADD THAT TO THE

1391
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
CAT VIDEO.

1392
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
>> AND THEN WE GOT A BLACK CAT

1393
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
WHO I THOUGHT WAS A MALE AND I

1394
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
NAMED THE CAT WILLIAM.

1395
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
BUT THEN I FOUND OUT IT WAS A

1396
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
FEMALE SO I NAMED HER

1397
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
MIDNIGHT.

1398
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
BUT I LIKED THE LITERAL NAMES

1399
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
FOR MY ANIMALS.

1400
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
>> THANKS FOR NAMING HIM

1401
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
WILLIAM.

1402
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
WE WILL CLOSE THINGS OUT WITH

I ALWAYS LIKE BEING IN BUFFALO

MAYBE WE CAN MEET ON ROUTE 90

1420
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
