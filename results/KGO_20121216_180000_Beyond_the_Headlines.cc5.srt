58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
>> Cheryl: PEOPLE GET TO KNOW

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
EACH OTHER?

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
>> PEOPLE GET TO KNOW ONE

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
ANOTHER AND ALL THE STEREOTYPES

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
GET WIPED OUT.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
WE CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER AND

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
SAID.
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT MONEY.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I KNOW THE BUDGET HAS BEEN A

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
STRUGGLE TO PUT THE EVENT ON.

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
>> IT STARTED WHEN THE ECONOMIC

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
DOWNTURN STARTED AND WE LOST

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000

WE'VE BEEN THERE 25 YEARS AND

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
NEW VENUES HAVE FEWER SEATS.

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THOSE LOSS OF SEATS HAVE

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
TRANSLATED TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
DOLLAR PER YEAR LOST INCOME

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
REVENUE WHICH HAS PUT US IN A

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
POSITION.

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
>> Cheryl: YOU HAD AUDITIONS?

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
PART OF THE CULTURAL ECOLOGY FOR

INVOLVED IN THAT.

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I WANT TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING

IT'S A PILOT PROGRAM.

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
WE KNOW THAT THE KIDS ARE THE

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000

SCHOOLS AND SHARE MY ART FORM

495
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
AND HOPEFULLY INSPIRE PEOPLE NOT

496
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BUT BECAUSE

497
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
THEY WANT TO.

498
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
>> Cheryl: GRAHAM, I WAS

499
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
THINKING ABOUT HOW DIFFERENTLY

500
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
YOUR NUTCRACKER IS.

501
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
WHY IS IT SO DIFFERENT?

502
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
>> IT'S A LATER PERIOD,

503
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
EDWARDIAN PERIOD.

504

WE HAVE 50 PEOPLE AND IT'S PART

508
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
OF THEIR EDUCATION.

509
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
SOME OF THEM ARE ON STAGE FOR

510

THEY HAVE EIGHT MINUTES ON STAGE

512
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
SO IT'S VERY EXCITING TO SEE

513
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
THEM, GRASP THEIR ROLE AND TAKE

514
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000

THE STAGE.

528
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
THE KEY IS TO DEAL WITH IT AT

529
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
THE MOMENT.

530
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
