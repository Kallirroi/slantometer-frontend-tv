WE'RE JOINED NOW BY DAVID

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
CASS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND A

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
FORMER SPECIAL AGENT TO THE

193
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
DAVID, WELCOME, THANK YOU FOR

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
JOINING ON THIS DAY.

196
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
OBVIOUSLY WE WISH IT WAS UNDER

197
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES.

198
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
BUT BACK TO THE POINT.

199
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
HAVE YOU EVER EXPERIENCED AN

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION LIKE

201
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
THIS ONE WITH POSSIBLE

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
CASUALTIES AND HOSTAGES

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
INSIDE?
>> I WAS A SPECIAL AGENT WITH

204
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
DRUG ENFORCEMENT, AND ALTHOUGH

205
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
THERE ARE HIGH RISK WARRANTS

206
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
AND AFFECTING ARREST OF

207
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
DANGEROUS PEOPLE THEY'RE

208
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
PROACTIVE IN NATURE NOT

209
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
REACTIVE.

210
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
SO OUR TRAINING FOR THIS TYPE

211
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
OF SCENARIO STEMS ON WHAT IS

212
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
CALLED THE RESCUE, AN

213
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
UNDERCOVER AGENT IN THE

214
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
RESIDENCE, IN THE LOCATION

215
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
THAT WE HAVE TO GET OUT

216
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
QUICKLY.

217
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
SO WE WOULD GO IN HEEDLESS,

218
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
THE TACTICS LESS DESIGNED TO

219
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
MOVE SAFE AND SLOW, BUT

220
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
DESIGNED TO GET TO THE PERSON

221
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
IN DANGER AS QUICKLY AS

222
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
POSSIBLE AND THAT'S WHAT AN

223
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
ACTIVE SHOOTER RESPONSE IS ALL

224
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
ABOUT.

225
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
>> Kelly: SO THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE TRAINED TO DO.

226
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
FROM AN OFFICER-AGENT POINT OF

227
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
VIEW WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IN A

228
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS, WHEN

229
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
SOMEWHAT IS GOING ON INVOLVING

230
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
INCIDENT CHILDREN AND TEACHERS

231
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
THAT CAN'T DEFEND THEMSELVES.

232
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR MIND

233
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
AND YOUR HEAD IN TERMS OF

234
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
REACTION.
>> I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR

235
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
MOST PEOPLE IN LAW

236
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
ENFORCEMENT, GET IN AS QUICKLY

237
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
AS POSSIBLE AB STOP WHAT'S

238
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
HAPPENING IMMEDIATELY AND I

239
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
DON'T THINK YOU'RE REALLY

240
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
CONCERNED ABOUT--

241
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND, YOU

242
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S DANGEROUS

243
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
AND IT MAY BE A DANGER TO YOUR

244
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
PERSONAL SAFETY, BUT LOOK,

245
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
THESE ARE KIDS, ALL OUR

246
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
CHILDREN AND THE PARENTS WOULD

247
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
HAVE RUSHED IN BARE HANDED TO

248
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
CONFRONT THIS AND LAW

249
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
ENFORCEMENT, SAT THING.

250
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
>> Kelly: YOU'RE RIGHT.

251
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
PARENTS WOULD RUN IN BARE

252
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
HANDED AND MANY PARENTS IN THE

253
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
WAKE OF THE TRAGEDY WITHOUT

254
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
THEIR LOVED ONES THERE, FEEL

255
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
POWERLESS AND HELPLESS TO DO

256
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
ANYTHING.
HOW DO YOU FOLLOW UP ON A

257
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
CRIME SCENE LIKE THIS, NOT

258
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
ONLY IN TERMS OF THE FAMILY

259
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
AND BRIEG THEM SAL LAST, BUT

260
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
GATHERING ALL THE NECESSARY

261
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
EVIDENCE THAT WILL HELP THEM

262
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT POSSIBLY WENT

263
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
WRONG AND WHY IT HAPPENED.

264
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
>> AND AT THIS POINT, IT'S NOT

265
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
A MATTER OF GATHERING EVIDENCE

266
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
FOR A TRIAL, A TRIAL, RATHER,

267
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
BUT THE SHOOTER IS DEAD.

268
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
JUST IN THE OFF, OFF CHANCE

269
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
THERE IS ANOTHER INVOLVED
PERSON, WHICH IS VERY, VERY

270
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
UNLIKELY AND YOU WANT TO MAKE

271
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
SURE THAT YOU DO THE

272
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
INVESTIGATION THOROUGHLY AND

273
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
IT'S ABSOLUTELY HEART BREAKING

274
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
WHEN YOU HEAR THAT THE

275
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
CHILDREN WERE LYING AT SCHOOL

276
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
FOR ALL THOSE HOURS AND

277
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT,

278
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER HAS TO

279
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS AND

280
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
OF COURSE THE CRIME SCENE HAS

281
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
TO BE WELL DOCUMENTED AND

282
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
PRESERVED.
BUT THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO

283
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
IS HOPE THAT THERE ARE LESSONS

284
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
LEARNED AND GOING FORWARD,

285
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS ARE

286
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
PREVENTED.
>> AND BEFORE YOU LET YOU GO,

287
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS OF
SOMEONE LIKE THIS GAINING

288
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
ACCESS TO SUCH HIGH CALIBER

289
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
WEAPONS, ANYTHING THAT COULD

290
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
HAVE BEEN DONE TO PREVENT THE

291
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
GUY FROM GETTING HOLD OF THE

292
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
WEAPONS AND USING THEM IN SUCH

293
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
A MANNER AS THIS WAS TOTALLY

294
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
UNAPPROPRIATE, INAPPROPRIATE?

295
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
>> WELL, THE REPORTS, WEAPONS

296
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
WERE REGISTERED TO THE MOTHER

297
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
AND I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH,

298
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
OWNING A FIREARM IS A

299
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY AND

300
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
SECURING THEM FROM SOMEONE NOT

301
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
TO HAVE ACCESS TO THEM.

302
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
YOU FILL OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE

303
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
AND REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW,

304
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
AND ONE IS AN EXHAUSTIVE

305
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND AND UNDER

306
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
INDICTMENT AND LINE ITEMS

307
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
WHETHER YOU'RE TREATED FOR

308
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
MENTAL ILLNESS OR ON NARCOTICS

309
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
OR MEDICATIONS AND NO WAY FOR

310
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN SELLING

311
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
WEAPONS TO VERIFY, AND DO A

312
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK,

313
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
WHICH IS DONE, BUT THE MENTAL

314
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
ISSUE WE NEED TO DO A BETTER

315
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
JOB OF IDENTIFYING THESE

316
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
PEOPLE AND MAKING IT

317
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET A

318
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
HOLD OF WEAPONS.

319
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
>> Kelly: THAT CERTAINLY SEEMS

320
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
TO BE A QUESTION A LOT OF

321
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT WHEN

322
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
THEY MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS

323
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
INVESTIGATION AND REACTION TO

324
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
THIS.

325
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR.

326
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
>> AND HOW THIS, AND TWO THEY

327
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
TOOK TO THE HOSPITAL ARE DEAD

328
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
NOW AND YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH

329
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
ASSUME THAT THE ONES IN THE

330
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
HOSPITAL, I MEAN, THAT ARE IN

331
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THE SCHOOL ARE DEAD.

332
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
AND EVERYBODY IN THE SCHOOL IS

333
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
DEAD.

334
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
>> THIS TOWN IS 300 YEARS OLD.

335
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST DAY

336
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
IN THE HISTORY OF THIS TOWN.

337
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
AND IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT

338
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
ANYTHING LIKE THIS COULD

339
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
HAPPEN IN THIS TOWN, IT'S A

340
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
QUIET TOWN, MAYBE IT'S TOO

341
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
QUIET.
>> LOT OF EMOTION AND LOTS OF

342
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
PAIN THERE.

343
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
AND UNDERSTANDABLY NEWTON'S

344
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
RESIDENTS REMAIN IN SHOCK AS

345
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
THEIR BUCOLIC LITTLE TOWN WAS

346
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
HIT WITH ONE OF THE DEADLIEST

347
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
MASS SHOOTING.

348
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
AND WHAT'S LEFT OF THE 30,000

349
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
WHO LIVE IN THAT COMMUNITY

350
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
WITH A VERY LOW CRIME RATE.

351
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
HARD TO IMAGINE BACK IN 2010,

352
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
NEWTOWN SAW ONLY ONE VIOLENT

353
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
CRIME.
WELL, YOUR CHILD DIDN'T HAVE

354
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
TO BE, BUT WATCHING ON

355
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
TELEVISION CAN BE TRAUMATIZING

356
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
AS WELL.
HOW COULD WE EXPLAIN WHAT IS

357
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
HAPPENING TO OUR CHILDREN.

358
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
AND FROM HARVARD MEDICAL

359
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
SCHOOL, JOINING VALUABLE

360
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
INSIGHT AND OFFERING WAYS OF

361
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
COMFORT AND HOPE AS MANY ARE

362
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
STRUGGLING TO FIND THIS

363
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
SENSELESS TRAGEDY.

364
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
GOOD TO HAVE YOU.

365
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
>> THANK YOU.

366
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
>> IF YOUR CHILD SAYS I'M

367
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
SCARED.
ISN'T THE WORST THING TO SAY

368
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE SCARED.

369
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
SHOULDN'T WE ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR

370
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
FEELINGS.
>> ABSOLUTELY.

371
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
THE FIRST THING WE SHOULD DO

372
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
IS LISTEN TO THE CHILDREN

373
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
REACT TO THEIR FEAR AND GRIEF,

374
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
BEING SCARED AND ANXIOUS AND

375
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
BEING DEPRESSED AND WANTING TO

376
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
BE COMFORTED AND HUGGED,

377
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
THAT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT AND

378
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
FOR THE PARENTS TO KIND OF

379
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
STAND BY AND A LOT OF THOSE

380
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
CHILDREN, AND CHILDREN AROUND

381
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE OF WHAT

382
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
HAPPENED IN CONNECTICUT, ARE

383
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
GOING TO BE HAVING NIGHTMARES

384
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
TONIGHT, SLEEP PROBLEMS, MAYBE

385
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
EATING PROBLEMS, MAYBE A LOT

386
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
OF PHYSICAL COMPLAINTS,

387
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
STOMACH ACHES, UPSETS.

388
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I THINK THAT PARENTS HAVE TO

389
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
BE VERY ALERT TO THAT AND KNOW

390
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
THAT THEY HAVE TO BE

391
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
REASSURING TO THE CHILDREN AS

392
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

393
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
MANY OF THEM AROUND THE

394
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
COUNTRY, NOT JUST AGAIN IN

395
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
CONNECTICUT, ARE NOT GOING TO

396
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL ON

397
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
MONDAY, PERHAPS.

398
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE.

399
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
THEY'RE THE NOT CLEAR WHY THIS

400
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
HAPPENED AND WHETHER IT COULD

401
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
HAPPEN IN THEIR SCHOOL AS WELL

402
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
SO THEY ARE HE' GOING TO HAVE

403
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
SOME ANXIETY AND PARENTS MAY

404
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
HAVE TO SUPPORT THEM AND

405
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
REASSURE THEM THAT THEY'RE

406
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
SAFE IN THEIR SCHOOL.

407
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
NOW, RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE ARE NOT

408
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
FEELING THAT WAY, BUT PUTTING

409
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
IT IN PERSPECTIVE, THESE ARE

410
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
CURRENCIES, RELATIVELY RARE.

411
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
IF YOU LOOK AT THEM.

412
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
SO, IT HAPPENED.

413
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
IT'S AWFUL, IT'S TRAGIC, IT'S

414
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
PAINFUL PARTICULARLY FOR THE

415
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
CONNECTICUT PEOPLE WHERE THIS

416
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
IS GOING TO BE WITH THEM OR

417
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES, BUT I

418
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
THINK THAT WE SHOULD LET THE

419
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
OTHER CHILDREN IN THE COUNTRY

420
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
KNOW THAT THEY'RE RELATIVELY

421
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
SAFE AND THAT THE PARENTS WILL

422
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
PROTECT THEM, THE SCHOOLING

423
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
WILL DO ALL THAT THEY CAN TO

424
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
PROTECT THEM.

425
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
THE POLICE WILL DO ALL THAT

426
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
THEY CAN TO PROTECT THEM.

427
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
AND SO FAR, LOOKING AT IT IN

428
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
THE LONG-TERM, IT HAS BEEN

429
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
WORKING WELL, BUT WE STILL ARE

430
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
SCARRED BY THESE AWFUL,

431
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
HORRIFIC TRAGEDIES THAT DAMAGE

432
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
NOT ONLY THE COMMUNITIES AND

433
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
THE CHILDREN, BUT ALSO THE HE

434
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
BE TIRE COUNTRY.

435
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
>> INDEED.

436
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
YOU'VE DONE SOME GROUND

437
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
BREAKING WORK WITH YOUNG

438
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT

439
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
COMES OF ISSUE OF VIOLENCE.

440
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
HOW DO YOU ENGAGE TEENAGERS,

441
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THESE

442
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
CONVERSATIONS?

443
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
>> WELL, I THINK THAT

444
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
TEENAGERS PRETTY MUCH HAVE A

445
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
REGULAR DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

446
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
VIOLENCE.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE AS PUZZLED

447
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
AS ADULTS.

448
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
BUT I THINK WE ALSO IS TO

449
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
EXPLAIN TO TEENAGERS AND

450
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
CHILDREN THAT WE HAVE TO DO

451
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
ALL THAT WE CAN TO PREVENT

452
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
VIOLENCE.

453
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
YOU KNOW, SINCE THESE

454
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
SHOOTINGS STARTING, DECADES

455
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
AGO, THAT WE HAVE VIOLENCE

456
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
PREVENTION PROGRAMS, CONFLICT

457
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
RESOLUTION PROGRAMS, WE HAVE

458
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
PROGRAMS THAT TEACH CHILDREN

459
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
TOLERANCE, ANTI-BULLYING

460
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
PROGRAMS SO THAT YOUNG PEOPLE

461
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
DON'T DEVELOP THE KIND OF HATE

462
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
AND FURY AND FRUSTRATION THAT

463
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
LEADS SOMEONE TO COMMIT A

464
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
CRIME AS HORRIFIC AS THIS ONE.

465
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
SO I THINK WE STILL SHOULD

466
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
FOCUS ON OUR VIOLENCE

467
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
PREVENTION EFFORTS AND I THINK

468
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
THE WHOLE ISSUE OF GUN CONTROL

469
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
SHOULD COME UP.

470
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
PARENTS SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN

471
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
THAT.

472
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
OTHER CITIZENS.

473
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
WHAT KIND OF CONTROLS DO WE

474
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
NEED THAT MIGHT MINIMIZE THE

475
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
CHANCES OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS

476
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
OCCURRING.

477
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
AND I THINK THAT THINGS WE CAN

478
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
DO.
REICH RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE CLOSE

479
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
TO 300 MILLION GUNS IN

480
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
CIRCULATION AND HANDS AND

481
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
THAT'S ONE GUN FOR EVERY MAN,

482
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE

483
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
IF YOU HAVE THAT MANY GUNS IN

484
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
CIRCULATION, YOU CAN BE SURE

485
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
THERE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE,

486
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT

487
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
MOTIVATION, WE TALK ABOUT THE

488
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
FACT THERE ARE A CERTAIN

489
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
NUMBER OF DERANGED PEOPLE, I'M

490
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
NOT SAYING MENTALLY ILL,

491
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF

492
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE, BUT THEY

493
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
CERTAINLY ARE DERANGED PEOPLE

494
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
WHO WILL DO SOMETHING LIKE

495
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
THIS, THAT IN MY DEFINITION,

496
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
THESE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING

497
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
FROM MENTAL DISORDERS OF

498
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
VARIOUS TYPES BEING EXPRESSED

499
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

500
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
AND SO I THINK--

501
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
YES, GO AHEAD.

502
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
>> DO YOU THINK THAT YOUNG

503
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
PEOPLE MAY HAVE A TENDENCY TO

504
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
BECOME IMMUNE OF THE VIOLENCE

505
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
IF NE CONTINUE TO SEE THE

506
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
STORIES WE'VE SEEN OVER THE

507
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
LAST SEVERAL MONTHS OF ONE

508
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
SHOOTING AFTER ANOTHER?

509
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
>> WELL, YES, I CAN.

510
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
IN FACT, ONE OF THE THINGS

511
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
THAT WE KNOW WHEN CHILDREN

512
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
WATCH A LOT OF VIOLENCE ON

513
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
TELEVISION AND THE MOVIES, AND

514
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
EVEN IN VIDEO GAMES, THEY

515
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
BECOME A BIT NUMB TO IT ALL.

516
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
AS IF IT'S NOT REALLY

517
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
HAPPENING, AS IF THEY REALLY

518
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
DON'T APPRECIATE WHAT DEATH

519
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
AND KILLING IS.

520
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
YES, THAT CAN HAPPEN AND EVEN

521
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
YESTERDAY, COME SOME OF THE

522
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
KIDS WERE ACTING NUMBER TO THE

523
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
VIOLENCE AND CHILDREN WERE

524
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
SEEING VIOLENCE NEARLY EVERY

525
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
DAY ON THE SIX O'CLOCK NEWS

526
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
SWELLS IN VIDEO GAMES AS WELL

527
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
AS ON TELEVISION AND THE

528
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
MOVIES AND SO IT'S LIKE AN

529
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
EVERYDAY KIND OF MATTER AND

530
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
THE YOUNGER ONES AREN'T SURE

531
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
WHEN PEOPLE ARE KILLED THAT
THEY'RE DEAD.

532
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
SO, WE HAVE TO -- WE HAVE TO

533
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION AND

534
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
MAKE IT A POSITIVE ONE TO TRY

535
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE

536
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
HORRIFIC EVENTS.

537
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000

IS SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO BE

545
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
TALKING ABOUT FOR SOME TIME,

546
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
APPRECIATE IT.

547
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000

FAITH IN GOD.

778
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
NO, IT HASN'T.

779
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000

BECAUSE GOD HATES THIS AND I

1227

QUESTION.

1234
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
WHY DID GOD ALLOW THIS TO

HAPPEN.

AFFECTS INNOCENT PEOPLE AND WE

PERIOD FROM WHY TO WHAT, NOT

JUST WHY ME, BUT AFTER WE

GRIEVE, WHAT NOW?

1267
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
THE BIBLE WILL TELL US TAKE

1268
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
HELLACIOUS THINGS LIKE THIS

1269
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
AND USE IT IT IT FOR THEIR

1270

PURPOSES AND I DON'T

1271
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
UNDERSTAND THAT AND I DON'T

1272
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
THINK WE WILL UNTIL WE GETS TO
THE OTHER SIDE, BUT THAT'S

1273

THINGS ARE GOING WELL, SO

1286
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
