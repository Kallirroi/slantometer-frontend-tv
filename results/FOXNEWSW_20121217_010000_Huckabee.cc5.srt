WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE MOST AWARE

422
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000

423
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000

426
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000

427
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
WHEN YOU CALL JEREMIAH OR AMOS

428
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
OR BARUK AND ALL OF YOUR

429
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
PRECIOUS APOSTLES AND

430
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
PROPHETS, THEY HEDGED AT

431
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
FIRST, BUT EACH TIME IN TURN

432
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
THEY GAVE THEIR YES AND THEY

433
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
FOLLOWED YOU, KNOWING THAT YOU

434
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
WERE ALWAYS AMONG THEM, ALWAYS

435
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
SUPPORTING THEM.

436
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
THEY WERE CONDUITS FOR YOUR

00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
EYES AND YOUR EARS AND YOUR

438
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
VOICE AND YOUR HANDS.

439
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
THEY WERE THE CLAY KNOWING

440
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
THAT YOU ALWAYS WERE THE

441
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
POTTER AND THEY WERE RESILIENT

442
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
IN YOUR HANDS.

443
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
WHEN JESUS FELT THE NEED TO

444
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
GET AWAY FOR SOME RESPITE

445
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000

TIRED AND DRAINED, AS HE WAS,

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000

453
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000

WE ARE ALSO A PLACE THAT HAS

501
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
GREAT PRIDE IN OUR SCHOOLS,

502
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
PRIDE THAT PROPELS THE

508
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
THE HORROR THAT WAS VISITED

509
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
UPON OUR SANDY HOOK SCHOOL WAS

510
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
NOT DESERVED.

511
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
IT IS THE ANGRY AND DESPERATE

512
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
ACT OF A CONFUSED YOUNG MAN.

513
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
THERE IS NO BLAME TO BE LAID

514
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
ON US, BUT THERE IS A GREAT

515
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
BURDEN AND A GREAT CHALLENGE

516
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
THAT WE EMERGE WHOLE, THAT

517
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
TRUST THAT WE LOVE THEM AND

HELP THEM HEAL.

522
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I KNOW THAT NEWTOWN WILL

523
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
PREVAIL THAT WE WILL NOT FALL

524
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
TO ACTS OF VIOLENCE.

525
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
IT IS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR

526
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
OUR TOWN, BUT IT DOES NOT

527
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
DEFINE US.

528
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
WE ARE NEWTOWN, A SPECIAL AND

IT ALSO SPEAKS OF THE POWER OF

INTRODUCE PRESIDENT OBAMA.

LET'S LISTEN IN.

585
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
>> TO SURVIVE THAT WHICH HAS

586
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
BEFALLEN THIS COMMUNITY, THESE

587
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
FAMILIES, THESE SPOUSES.

588
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
THAT WHICH HAS HAPPENED AND IS

589
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
UNIMAGINABLE AND UNTHINKABLE

590
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
AND WAS NEVER, WE THOUGHT,

591
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
INTENDED TO BE VISITED UPON US

592
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
HERE IN CONNECTICUT OR IN

593
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
NEWTOWN, OR IN SANDY HOOK.

594
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I CHOOSE TO THINK ABOUT THE

595
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
FACT THAT IN THE COMING DAYS

596
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
WE WILL OFFICIALLY ENTER

597
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
WINTER.

598
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
AND THAT IS ALWAYS TO BE

599
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
FOLLOWED BY THE SPRING.

600
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT IN

601
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
WINTER EACH TIME I SEE THE

602
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
BEGINNING OF A SNOWFALL, I

603
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
WILL BE THINKING OF THOSE 27

604
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
SOULS LOST JUST A FEW DAYS

605
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
AGO.

606
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
EACH TIME THE DAY GETS A

607
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
LITTLE LONGER, I WILL THINK

608
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
AND DREAM OF THE LIVES THAT

609
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND THE LIVES

610
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
THAT WERE SO FULL OF GRACE.

611
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
AND WHEN THE FLOWERS START TO

612
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
COME OUT OF THE GROUND AND

613
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
WHEN THEY RISE UP, I WILL KNOW

614
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
THAT WE ARE IN TOUCH WITH

615
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
THOSE THAT WE'VE LOST IN THE

616
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
LAST FEW DAYS.

617
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
WE WILL GO ON.

618
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
WE WILL FIND STRENGTH.

619
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
FAITH IS A GIFT, AS IS OUR

620
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
ABILITY TO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER

621
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
IN OUR GREATER COMMUNITY.

622
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
TO ALL OF YOU, I EXTEND MY

623
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
MOST PROFOUND CONDOLENCES ON

SEEN, WHAT YOU HAVE WITNESSED

627
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
AND WHAT YOU HAVE PERSONALLY

628
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
EXPERIENCED.

629
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
WE WILL MOVE ON.

630
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
WE WILL NEVER FORGET.

631
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
WE WILL IN MANY WAYS BE MADE

632
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
STRONGER FOR WHAT HAS

633
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
TRANSPIRED.

634
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
AND WE WILL GET BETTER.

635
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
WE ARE BLESSED TODAY TO HAVE

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
AND WE FIX OUR EYES NOT ON

667
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
WHAT IS SEEN, BUT WHAT IS

668
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
UNSEEN.

669
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
WHAT IS SEEN IS TEMPORARY, BUT

670
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
WHAT IS UNSEEN IS ETERNAL.

671
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
FOR WE KNOW THAT IF THE

672
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000

DESTROYED, WE HAVE A BUILDING

674
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
FROM GOD.

675
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
AN ETERNAL HOUSE IN HEAVEN,

676
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
NOT BUILT BY HUMAN HANDS.

BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN AND SIX

679
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
REMARKABLE ADULTS.

680
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
THEY LOST THEIR LIVES IN A

681
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
SCHOOL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN

682
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
ANY SCHOOL.

683
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
IN A QUIET TOWN FULL OF GOOD

684
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
AND DECENT PEOPLE, THAT COULD

685
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
BE ANY TOWN IN AMERICA.

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
A NATION.

689
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I AM VERY MINDFUL THAT MERE

690
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
WORDS CANNOT MATCH THE DEPTHS

691
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
OF YOUR SORROW, NOR CAN THEY

692
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
HEAL YOUR WOUNDED HEARTS.

00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000

ALONE IN YOUR GRIEF.

696
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
THAT OUR WORLD, TOO, HAS BEEN

697
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000

00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
THAT YOUNG CHILDREN SOMETIMES

753
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
DO.

754
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
ONE CHILD EVEN TRIED TO

755
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
ENCOURAGE A GROWNUP BY SAYING,

756
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I KNOW KARATE, SO, IT'S OKAY,

757
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I'LL LEAD THE WAY OUT.

758
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
AS A COMMUNITY, YOU'VE

759
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
INSPIRED US, NEWTOWN.

760
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
IN THE FACE OF INDESCRIBABLE

761
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
VIOLENCE, IN THE FACE OF

762
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
UNCONSCIONABLE EVIL, YOU'VE

763
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
LOOKED OUT FOR EACH OTHER,

764
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
YOU'VE CARED FOR ONE ANOTHER

765
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
AND YOU'VE LOVED ONE ANOTHER.

766
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
THIS IS HOW NEWTOWN WILL BE

767
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
REMEMBER

768
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
REMEMBERED.
AND WITH TIME AND GOD'S GRACE,

769
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
THAT LOVE WILL SEE YOU

770
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
THROUGH.

771
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
THROUGH.
BUT WE AS A NATION, WE ARE

772
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
LEFT WITH SOME HARD QUESTIONS.

773
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE ONCE

774
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
DESCRIBED THE JOY AND ANXIETY

775
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
OF PARENTHOOD AS THE

776
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
EQUIVALENT OF HAVING YOUR

777
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
HEART OUTSIDE OF YOUR BODY ALL

778
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
THE TIME.

779
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
WALKING AROUND.

780
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
WITH THEIR VERY FIRST CRY,

781
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
THIS MOST PRECIOUS, VITAL PART

782
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
OF OURSELVES, OUR CHILD, IS

783
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
SUDDENLY EXPOSED TO THE WORLD,

784
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
POSSIBLE MISHAPS OR MALICE.

785
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
AND EVERY PARENT KNOWS THERE'S

786
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
NOTHING WE WILL NOT DO TO

787
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
SHIELD OUR CHILDREN FROM HARM.

788
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
AND YET, WE ALSO KNOW THAT

789
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
WITH THAT CHILD'S VERY FIRST

790
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
STEP, AND EACH STEP AFTER

791
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
THAT, THEY'RE SEPARATING FROM

792
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
US.

793
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
THAT WE WON'T, THAT WE CAN'T

794
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
ALWAYS BE THERE FOR THEM.

795
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
THEY'LL SUFFER SICKNESS AND

796
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
SETBACKS AND BROKEN HEARTS,

797
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
AND DISAPPOINTMENTS.

798
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
AND WE LEARN THAT OUR MOST

799
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
IMPORTANT BE JOB IS TO GIVE

800
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO BECOME

801
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
SELF-RELIANT AND CAPABLE AND

802
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
RESILIENT READY TO FACE THE

803
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
WORLD WITHOUT FEAR.

804
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
AND WE KNOW WE CAN'T DO THIS

805
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
BY OURSELVES.

806
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
IT COMES AS A SHOCK AT A

807
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
CERTAIN POINT WHEN YOU REALIZE

808
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU LOVE

809
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
THESE KIDS, YOU CAN'T DO IT BY

810
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
YOURSELF.

811
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
THAT THIS JOB OF KEEPING OUR

812
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
CHILDREN SAFE AND TEACHING

813
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
THEM WELL IS SOMETHING WE CAN

814
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
ONLY DO TOGETHER.

815
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
WITH THE HELP OF FRIENDS AND

816
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
NEIGHBORS, THE HELP OF A

817
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
COMMUNITY, AND THE HELP OF A

818
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
NATION.

819
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
AND IN THAT WAY, WE COME TO

820
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
REALIZE THAT WE BEAR A

821
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERY CHILD

822
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
BECAUSE WE'RE COUNTING ON

823
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
EVERYBODY ELSE TO HELP LOOK

824
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
AFTER OURS.

825
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
AND WE'RE ALL PARENTS.

826
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
THAT THEY'RE ALL OUR CHILDREN.

827
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
THIS IS OUR FIRST TASK, CARING

828
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
FOR OUR CHILDREN.

829
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
IT'S OUR FIRST JOB.

830
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
IF WE DON'T GET THAT RIGHT WE

831
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
DON'T GET ANYTHING RIGHT.

832
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
THAT'S HOW, AS A SOCIETY, WE

833
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
WILL BE JUDGED.

834
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
AND BY THAT MEASURE, CAN WE

835
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
TRULY SAY AS A NATION THAT

836
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
WE'RE MEETING OUR OBLIGATIONS.

837
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
CAN WE HONESTLY SAY THAT WE'RE

838
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
DOING ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR

839
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
CHILDR

840
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
CHILDREN, ALL OF THEM, SAFE

841
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
FROM HARM?

842
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
CAN WE CLAIM AS A NATION THAT

843
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
WE'RE ALTOGETHER THERE,

844
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
LETTING THEM KNOW THAT THEY'RE

845
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
LOVED AND TEACHING THEM TO

846
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
LOVE IN RETURN?

847
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
CAN WE SAY THAT WE'RE TRULY

848
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
DOING ENOUGH TO GIVE ALL THE

849
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
CHILDREN OF THIS COUNTRY THE

850
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
CHANCE THEY DESERVE TO LIVE

851
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
OUT THEIR LIVES IN HAPPINESS

852
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
AND WITH PURPOSE?

853
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I'VE BEEN REFLECTING ON THIS

854
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
THE LAST FEW DAYS AND IF WE'RE

855
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
HONEST WITH OURSELVES, THE

856
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
ANSWER IS NO.

857
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH.

858
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
AND WE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE.

859
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
SINCE I'VE BEEN PRESIDENT,

860
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME WE

861
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
HAVE COME TOGETHER TO COMFORT

862
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
A GRIEVING COMMUNITY TORN

863
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
APART BY MASS SHOOTINGS.

864
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
FOURTH TIME WE'VE HUGGED

865
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
SURVIVORS, THE FOURTH TIME

866
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
WE'VE CONSOLED THE FAMILIES OF

867
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
VICTIMS.

868
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
AND IN BETWEEN THERE HAVE BEEN

869
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
AN ENDLESS SERIES OF DEADLY

870
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
SHOOTINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

871
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
ALMOST DAILY REPORTS OF

872
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
VICTIMS, MANY OF THEM

873
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
CHILDREN.

874
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
IN SMALL TOWNS AND BIG CITIES

875
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
ACROSS AMERICA, VICTIMS WHO

876
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
MUCH OF THE TIME THEIR ONLY

877
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
FAULT WAS BEING IN THE WRONG

878
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME.

879
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
WE CAN'T TOLERATE THIS

880
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
ANYMORE.

881
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
THESE TRAGEDIES MUST END.

882
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
AND TO END THEM, WE MUST

883
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
CHANGE.

884
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
WE WILL BE TOLD THAT THE

885
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
CAUSES OF SUCH VIOLENCE ARE

886
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
COMPLEX AND THAT IS TRUE.

887
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
NO SINGLE LAW, NO SET OF LAWS

888
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
CAN ELIMINATE EVIL FROM THE

889
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
WORLD OR PREVENT EVERY

890
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
SENSELESS ACT OF VIOLENCE IN

891
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
OUR SOCIETY, BUT THAT CAN'T BE

892
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
AN EXCUSE FOR INACTION.

893
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
SURELY, WE CAN DO BETTER THAN

894
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
THIS.
IF THERE'S EVEN ONE STEP WE

895
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
CAN TAKE TO SAVE ANOTHER CHILD

896
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
OR ANOTHER PARENT OR ANOTHER

897
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
TOWN FROM THE GRIEF THAT'S

898
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
VISITED TUCSON AND AURORA AND

899
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
OAK CREEK AND NEWTOWN, AND

900
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
COMMUNITIES FROM COLUMBINE TO

901
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
BLACKSBERG BEFORE THAT, SURELY

902
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO TRY.

903
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
IN THE COMING WEEKS I'LL USE

904
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE

905
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
HOLDS TO ENGAGE MY FELLOW

906
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
CITIZENS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT

907
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
TO MENTAL HEALTH

908
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
PROFESSIONALS, TO PARENTS AND

909
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
EDUCATORS, IN AN EFFORT AIMED

910
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
AT PREVENTING MORE TRAGEDIES

911
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
LIKE THIS BECAUSE WHAT CHOICE

912
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
DO WE HAVE?

913
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
WE CAN'T ACCEPT EVENTS LIKE

914
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
THIS AS ROUTINE.

915
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
ARE WE REALLY PREPARED TO SAY

916
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
THAT WE'RE POWERLESS IN THE

917
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
FACE OF SUCH CARNAGE?

918
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
THAT THE POLITICS ARE TOO HA

919
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
HARD?
ARE WE PREPARED TO SAY THAT

920
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
SUCH VIOLENCE VISITED ON OUR

921
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
CHILDREN YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER

922
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
YEAR, SOMEHOW THE PRICE OF OUR

923
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
FREEDOM?

924
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
IN ALL THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS,

925
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
SO MANY OF THEM REPRESENTED

926
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
HERE TODAY, START WITH A

927
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
QUESTION.

928
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
WHY ARE WE HERE?

929
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
WHAT GIVES OUR LIFE MEANING?

930
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
WHAT GIVES OUR ACTS PURPOSE?

931
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
WE KNOW OUR TIME ON THIS EARTH

932
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
IS FLEETING.
WE KNOW THAT WE WILL EACH HAVE

933
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
OUR SHARE OF PLEASURE AND

934
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
PAIN, THAT EVEN AFTER WE

935
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
CHAN

936
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
CHASE AFTER SOME EARTHLY GOAL,

937
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
WHETHER IT'S WEALTH, POWER,

938
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
FAME OR SIMPLE COMFORT, WE

939
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
WILL IN SOME FASHION FALL

940
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
SHORT OF WHAT WE HAD HOPED.

941
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
WE KNOW THAT NO MATTER HOW

942
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
GOOD OUR INTENTIONS WE'LL ALL

943
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000

WE'LL MAKE MISTAKES.

945
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
WE'LL EXPERIENCE HARDSHIPS.

946
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
AND EVEN WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO

947
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
DO THE RIGHT THING, WE KNOW

948
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
THAT MUCH OF OUR TIME WILL BE

949
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
SPENT GROPING THROUGH THE

950
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
DARKNESS, SO OFTEN UNABLE TO

951
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
DISCERN GOD'S HEAVENLY PLANS.

952
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING WE CAN

953
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
BE SURE OF AND THAT IS THE

954
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
LOVE THAT WE HAVE FOR OUR

955
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
CHILDREN, FOR OUR FAMILIES,

956
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
FOR EACH OTHER.

957
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
THE WARMTH OF A SMALL CHILD'S

958
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
EMBRACE, THAT IS TRUE.

959
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
THE MEMORIES WE HAVE OF THEM,

960
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
THE JOY THAT THEY BRING, THE

961
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
WONDER WE SEE THROUGH THEIR

962
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
EYES, THAT FIERCE AND

963
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
BOUNDLESS LOVE WE FEEL FOR

964
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
THEM, A LOVE THAT TAKES US OUT

965
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
OF OURSELVES AND BINDS US TO

966
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
SOMETHING LARGER, WE KNOW

967
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

968
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
WE KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS DOING

969
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
RIGHT WHEN WE'RE TAKING CARE

970
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
OF THEM.

971
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
WHEN WE'RE TEACHING THEM WELL.

972
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
WHEN WE'RE SHOWING ACTS OF

973
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
KINDNESS.

974
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
WE DON'T GO WRONG WHEN WE DO

975
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
THAT.

976
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
THAT'S WHAT WE CAN BE SURE

977
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
OF.

978
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000

980
