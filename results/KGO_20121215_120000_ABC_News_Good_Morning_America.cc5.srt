MOTHER ONCE SERVED AS A

187
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
VOLUNTEER OR A TEACHER'S AIDE.

188
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
>> THE CHILDREN DIDN'T HARM HIM.

189
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
BUT THEY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH

190
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
HIS MOTHER.

191
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
AND I MOTHER, I BELIEVE, MAY BE

192
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
REAL FOCUS OF ALL OF THIS.

193
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
>> Reporter: THE GUNS USED IN

194
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
THE ATTACK, ACCORDING TO POLICE,

195
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
ARE EXTREMELY POPULAR AND

196
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
COMMON, ELIZABETH, AMONG PEOPLE

197
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
IN THIS COUNTRY WHO DO OWN GUNS.

198
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
>> ALL RIGHT.

199
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
WE'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT,

200
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
BRIAN.
>>> WE'RE GOING TO TURN, NOW,

201
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
FROM THE FOCUS ON THE SUSPECT TO

202
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
THE FOCUS ON THE FAMILIES.

203
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
GEORGE HAS MORE ON THAT.

204
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
GEORGE?
>> THANKS, ELIZABETH.

205
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'M HERE WITH LIEUTENANT PAUL

206
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
VANCE OF STATE POLICE HERE IN

207
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
CONNECTICUT.

208
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
KEEPING PEOPLE INFORMED ALL
THROUGH THE DAY YESTERDAY.

209
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
WE LEARNED OVERNIGHT THAT YOU

210
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
WERE ABLE TO NOTIFY ALL OF THE

211
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
FAMILIES.
>> OUR DETECTIVES MADE IT A

212
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
PRIORITY TO, IN FACT, IDENTIFY

213
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
ALL OF THE DECEASED VICTIMS, THE

214
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
CHILDREN, AND THE ADULTS, WITHIN

215
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
THE FACILITY.

216
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
>> AND WHAT MORE HAVE YOU BEEN

217
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
ABLE TO LEARN ABOUT ADAM LANZA?

218
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
WHY AND HOW HE DID THIS?

219
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
>> THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S

220
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
GOING TO TAKE A SIGNIFICANT

221
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
AMOUNT OF TIME.

222
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
WE HAVE TEAMS PEELING THE ONION

223
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
BACK, SO TO SPEAK.
WE HAVE MANY, MANY QUESTIONS WE

224
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
NEED TO ASK AND WE NEED TO

225
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
EXPLORE.

226
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
>> THREE GUNS FOUND ON-SITE.

227
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
>> WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED THAT AS

228
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
OF YET.

229
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
IN EXCESS OF THREE GUNS.
>> MORE THAN THREE GUNS.

230
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
WE KNOW ALSO THAT THE GUNS MATCH

231
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
GUNS THAT HIS MOTHER MAY HAVE

232
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
HAD.
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO PUT THAT

233
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
TOGETHER YET?

234
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION

235
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
SPECIFICALLY.
>> DO YOU KNOW IF THEY WERE

236
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
OBTAINED LEGALLY.

237
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
>> THAT IS SOMETHING WE WOULD

238
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
ALSO EXPLORE IN THE

239
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
INVESTIGATION.

240
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
>> HOW ABOUT HOW ADAM LANZA GOT

241
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
INTO THE SCHOOL.

242
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
THERE WERE SOME REPORTS THAT THE

243
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
PRINCIPAL MAY HAVE BUZZED HIM

244
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
IN.

245
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
>> I THINK THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY

246
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
PREMATURE.

247
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
WE DO HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA

248
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
HOW ENTRANCE WAS OBTAINED.

249
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
WE HAVE AN ADULT WITNESS THAT

250
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
WAS WOUNDED THAT SURVIVED, WHO

251
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
WILL BE INVALUABLE TO US.

252
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
>> WHY THIS SCHOOL?

253
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
>> WE DO HAVE SOME BACKGROUND

254
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
INFORMATION, THAT THERE WAS A

255
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL.

256
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
THE SPECIFIC CONNECTION, I'D

257
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
RATHER NOT DIVULGE AND GET INTO

258
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
RIGHT NOW.
THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION OUT

259
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
THERE.
>> HIS MOM MAY HAVE BEEN A

260
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
TEACHER THERE AT SOME POINT?

261
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
>> FOR OUR PURPOSES, IT'S BETTER

262
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
WE EXPLORE THAT CONFIDENTLY FOR

263
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

264
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
>> I KNOW YOU'VE SPOKEN BOTH TO

265
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
HIS BROTHER AND HIS FATHER

266
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
OVERNIGHT.
WHAT WERE YOU ABLE TO LEARN FROM

267
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
THEM?

268
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
>> WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH LAW

269
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM OTHER
STATES, WHO ARE WORKING WITH US

270
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
ON THIS CASE, TO ASSIST US.

271
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
AND THEY HAVE EXTRACTED AND

272
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
OBTAINED INFORMATION THAT WAS

273
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
CRITICAL TO OUR INVESTIGATION.

274
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
>> ANY INDICATION THAT HE HAD

275
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THREATENED TO KILL BEFORE?

276
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
>> THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT

277
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
SURFACED IMMEDIATELY.

278
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
THERE'S NONE WHATSOEVER.

279
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
>> ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT HE

280
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
ACTACT

281
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
ED ABSOLUTELY ALONE?

282
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
>> YEAH.

283
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
>> LIEUTENANT VANCE, THANK YOU

284
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
FOR YOUR TIME.

285
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
>>> AS WE JUST HEARD, THE NAMES

286
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
OF THE VICTIMS WILL BE RELEASED

287
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
LATER THIS MORNING, INCLUDING

288
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
ALL THOSE CHILDREN.

289
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
PRAYING FOR THEM LAST NIGHT,

290
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
THIS COMMUNITY, HUNDREDS PACKED

291
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
INTO CHURCHES.
WE'RE GOING TO GO TO AMY ROBACH

292
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
WHO HAS MORE ON THE VICTIMS.

293
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
YOU WERE AT THE HOSPITAL ALL DAY

294
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
YESTERDAY.
>> IT HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT SCENE

295
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED, FROM THE

296
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000

FIREFIGHTERS.

298
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO

299
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
IMAGINE THE HORRIFIC REALITY

300
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE WAKING

301
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
UP TO THIS MORNING.

302
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
THAT WHAT HAPPENED HERE LESS
THAN 24 HOURS AGO, ACTUALLY

303
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
HAPPENED.
AND THIS MORNING, WE ARE

304
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE TEACHERS

305
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
AND THE CHILDREN INSIDE THAT

306
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
SCHOOL, WHO SO TRAGICALLY LOST

307
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
THEIR LIVES.

308
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
DISTRAUGHT FAMILY AND FRIENDS

309
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
CAME TOGETHER TO MOURN, TO CRY

310
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
AND TO REMEMBER THE 27 LIVES

311
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
LOST HERE IN NEWTOWN,
CONNECTICUT.

312
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
>> I'M SO SORRY.

313
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
>> Reporter: OVERNIGHT, WE

WAS TO PROTECT HER STUDENTS,

319
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
THROWING HERSELF IN THE LINE OF

320
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
FIRE.
20 OF 27 VICTIMS WERE STUDENTS

321
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

322
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
20 CHILDREN.

AND NOW, 20 FAMILIES MOURN

324
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
PRECIOUS LIVES LOST TOO SOON.

325

326
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000

AS PARENTS TRY TO EXPLAIN HOW A

330
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
NIGHTMARE BECAME A REALITY.

331
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
YOU KNOW, YOUR CHILD DOES NOT

OF THIS TRAGEDY TO BE

334
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
TRAUMATIZED.

335

SEEING OR HEARING THE IMAGES ON

336
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
THE SCREEN ARE TRAUMATIC ENOUGH.

337
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
IF YOU HAVE AN OLDER CHILD, MAKE

338
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
SURE YOU'RE TALKING TO THEM

339
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
ABOUT HOW THEY'RE FEELING.

340
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
AND THEN, SHIELDED THE CHILDREN

357
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
IN THE CLOSET, TRYING TO PROTECT

358
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000

THE HARM THAT WAS COMING.

I'M SURE SHE HEARD WHAT WAS

368
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
GOING ON.

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS A

513
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
FINAL ACT OF HEROISM ON HER PART

514
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
TO WARN THE TEACHERS AND

DEATH OF THEIR CHILDREN.

THEY KNEW IN THEIR HEARTS THIS

527

528
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000

ASKING, THE REGRETS THEY HAD.

530
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
WHY DID I SEND MY CHILD TO

531
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
SCHOOL TODAY?

532
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000

CHILDREN.

535
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
ONE OF THE DADS SHARED HOW FOR

536
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
SOME REASON THE CHILD GOT UP

537
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
EARLY AND JUST CAME DOWN AND

538
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
TOLD THE FATHER HOW MUCH SHE

539
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
LOVED HIM.

540
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
AND ANOTHER ONE SAID JUST THE

541
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
DAY BEFORE, THE CHILD ASKED HIM,

542
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
WHAT IS DYING LIKE?

543
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
SO, PARENTS ARE GOING THROUGH A

544
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PAIN AND

545
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
HAPPENED TO THEIR CHILD IN THE

TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AND

917
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
QUESTIONED BY AUTHORITIES.

918
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
BUT POLICE SAY HE IS NOT

00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
SUSPECTED OF BEING INVOLVED IN

920
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
THE SHOOTING.

RYAN WORKED AT ERNST & YOUNG IN

922
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
MANHATTAN.
INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING AT

923
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
WHETHER THE 20-YEAR-OLD SHOOTER

924
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
WAS CARRYING RYAN'S I.D. AT THE

925
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
CAUSE OF THE SHOOTING, CAUSING

926
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
THE INITIAL MISIDENTIFICATION.

927
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
AUTHORITIES TOLD ABC NEWS, THEIR

928
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
MOTHER, NANCY LANZA, WAS FOUND

929
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
FATALLY SHOT AT THEIR

930
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
CONNECTICUT HOME.

931
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
>> SHE RAISED VERY NICE BOYS TO

932
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
ME.

933
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S A SHOCK

934
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
TO EVEN KNOW THEM AND REALIZE

935
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
WHO THEY ARE.

936
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000

>> Reporter: STATE RECORDS
INDICATE SHE WAS DIVORCED FROM

938
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000

NANCY AND HER EX-HUSBAND, PETER

940
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000

A PARENTING EDUCATION PROGRAM,

942
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
NECESSARY FOR DIVORCED COUPLES

943
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
WITH CHILDREN UNDER 18.

944
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
>> THEY SAY THE FACT THAT THE

945
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
PARENTS WERE DIVORCED MUST HAVE

946
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
CONTRIBUTED TO IT.
>> Reporter: THE SHOOTER'S

947
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
FATHER, PETER LANZA, WAS A VICE

948
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
PRESIDENT AT G.E. CAPITAL, AND

949
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
HAD BEEN A PARTNER AT ERNST &

950
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
YOUNG.

951
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
HE IS REMARRIED AND WAS

952
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
QUESTIONED BY AUTHORITIES.

953
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
BUT IS NOT UNDER ANY SUSPICIOUS.

954
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
THE MOTHER WHO LIVED HERE ON

955
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THIS STREET, WAS -- HAD SOME

956
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL, WE'RE

957
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
TOLD.
BUT THE SUPERINTENDENT SAID THIS

958
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
MORNING THAT SHE WAS NOT

959
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
OFFICIALLY EMPLOYED THERE.

960
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
SHE MAY HAVE VOLUNTEERED IN SOME

961
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
WAY.
AS FOR THE FATHER, THEY'RE

962
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
DIVORCED.
HE DOESN'T LIVE HERE.

963
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
HE LIVES IN STANFORD.

964
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
AND HE APPARENTLY FOUND OUT

965
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
ABOUT THE KILLING FROM A

966
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
REPORTER WHO WAS IN HIS DRIVEWAY

967
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
WHEN HE CAME HOME AND INFORMED

968
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
HIM.

969
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>>> THE QUESTION GOES TO WHAT

970
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
WOULD MAKE A PERSON DO SOMETHING

971
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
LIKE THIS?

972
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
SOMETHING SO TERRIFIC TO

973
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
CHILDREN SO LITTLE.

974
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
LET'S BRING IN PSYCHIATRIST

975
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
DR. JANET TAYLOR TO TALK ABOUT

976
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
THE MIND OF THE SHOOTER.

977
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
CLEARLY, EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS

978
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
THIS YOUNG MAN WAS MENTALLY ILL.

979
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
BUT TO PICK CHILDREN, YOUNG,

980
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
YOUNG CHILDREN, AS HIS VICTIMS.

981
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I MEAN, THAT IS ABOUT THE WORST

982
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
THING YOU COULD DO.

983
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT

984
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
HIS MOTIVATION?

985
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
ABOUT HIS STABILITY OR

986
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
INSTABILITY, OBVIOUSLY?

987
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
>> CERTAINLY, THERE IS AN EVIL

988
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
JUST HEINOUS QUALITY TO IT.

989
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
AND THE FACT IS, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

990
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
TO PREDICT WHO WILL BE VIOLENT.

991
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
BUT RISK FACTORS ARE,

992
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN

993
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
EXPOSED TO PHYSICAL ABUSE,

994
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
SEXUAL ABUSE.

995
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
IF THERE'S AN UNDERLYING

996
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPAIRMENT, WHICH

997
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
CERTAINLY HE WAS DESCRIBED AS

998
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
ODD AND IN THE AUTISM SPECTRUM.

999
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO GUNS AND

1000
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
WEAPONS.
AND CERTAINLY, INDIVIDUALS WHO

1001
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
MAY HAVE REVENGE IN THEIR MIND.

1002
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
BUT WHO WANTS TO HURT INNOCENT

1003
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
CHILDREN?

1004
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
>> OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S A LOT OF

1005
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT ARE

1006
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
AUTISTIC OR HAVES ASPERGER'S

1007
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
SYNDROME AND NEVER COMMIT A

1008
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
VIOLENT ACT.
THIS YOUNG MAN, ACCORDING TO

1009
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
POLICE, IS SHOOTING HIS MOTHER

1010
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
AT HIS HOME, AND GETTING IN THE

1011
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
CAR WITH HIS WEAPONS, DRIVING TO

1012
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, WALKING IN

1013
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
AND SHOOTING KINDERGARTNERS AND

1014
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
FIRST GRADERS.

1015
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
>> I THINK THE PREMEDITATIVE

1016
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
QUALITY OF IT INDICATES A FACT

1017
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
THAT YOU CAN BE MENTALLY ILL.

1018
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
YOU CAN BE PSYCHOTIC AND KNOW

1019
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
RIGHT FROM AMONG.

1020
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
AND THIS CASE, I THINK HE

1021
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
DELIBERATELY KNEW WHAT HE WAS

1022
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
DOING.

1023
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
CERTAINLY, HIS UNDERLYING MENTAL

1024
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
ILLNESS, PRESUMABLY THAT HE HAD,

1025
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
WAS NOT AN EXCUSE IN ANY WAY FOR

1026
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
A WHAT HE DID.

1027
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
>> THE FACT THAT THE TARGET WAS

1028
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
YOUNG CHILDREN.

1029
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
DOES THAT GIVE YOU ANY

1030
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
INDICATION OF PERHAPS HE WAS

1031
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
TRYING TO HURT SOMETHING THAT

1032
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
MEANT SOMETHING TO HIS MOTHER?

1033
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
>> I MEAN, PRESUMABLY THAT WOULD

1034
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
BE THE LINK.

1035
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
UNFORTUNATELY, WE WILL NOT KNOW.

1036
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT THE

1037
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
FACT HE KILLED HIS MOTHER AND

1038
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
THEN WENT AND KILLED INNOCENT

1039
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
CHILDREN, MAYBE THERE'S A LINK

1040
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
BETWEEN HIS MOTHER AND THE KIDS.

1041
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
OR MAYBE HE JUST FELT LIKE HE

1042
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
WAS DOING SOMETHING SO HORRIFIC

1043
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
THAT HE WOULD ALWAYS BE

1044
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
REMEMBERED.

1045
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
WE WON'T KNOW.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE HAVE

1046
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
TO PRAY FOR THE FAMILIES AND

1047
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
UNDERSTAND THAT AT SOME POINT,

1048
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
WE WILL UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVE.

1049
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
BUT IT STILL WILL NEVER BE

1050
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
ENOUGH TO BRING THE POOR KIDS

1051
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
AND ADULTS WHO DIED BACK.

1052
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000

1193
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000

1210
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
THAT MY KIDS DON'T YET KNOW

1211
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
ABOUT THIS.
A LOT OF KIDS DON'T.

PSYCHOLOGIST SAID DON'T BRING IT

1215
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
UP IF THEY DON'T ASK ABOUT IT.

1216
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
IS THATTING THE RIGHT THING TO

1217
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
DO?
>> I THINK THE CHANCES OF THEM

1218
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
NOT HEARING ABOUT IT IN SOME

1219
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
FASHION ARE SLIM TO NONE.

1221
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
CHILDREN'S SCHOOL, AS WELL,

1222
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
ABOUT PLANS THEY WILL TAKE AT
THE SCHOOL ON MONDAY.

1223
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PARENTS TO

1224
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
REMEMBER THAT HOW THEY DEAL WITH

1225
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
THEIR CHILDREN, HAS TO BE BASED

1226
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
ON AGE.

1227
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
THE CONVERSATION YOU HAVE WITH A

1228
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
5-YEAR-OLD IS VERY DIFFERENT

1229
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
THAN A CONVERSATION YOU HAVE

1230
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
WITH A 15-YEAR-OLD.

1231
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

1232
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
THAT THERE MAY BE A SPECTRUM OF

1233
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
REACTIONS FROM CHILDREN WHO WERE

1234
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
NOT AT THE SCENE.

1235
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
IT MIGHT BE MILD.

1236
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
IT MIGHT BE SEVERE.

1237
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
AND IT MIGHT BE DELAYED.
IT MIGHT NOT APPEAR RIGHT AWAY.

1238
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
>> IT'S IMPORTANT TO STAY CALM

1239
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
WHEN YOU TALK WITH YOUR CHILD.

1240
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
AND TO REASSURE THEM, THAT EVEN

1241
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
THOUGH WE CAN'T TELL THEM YOU

1242
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
WILL ABSOLUTELY BE SAFE AT

1243
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
SCHOOL, SAY IT ANYWAY.

1244
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
GUARANTEE THEM.

1245
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
>> THAT'S KEY.

1246
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
YOU WANT TO KEEP THE HONEST

1247
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
COMMUNICATION OPEN.

1248
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
YOU WANT TO ASK THEM QUESTIONS.

1249
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
BUT YOU ALSO WANT TO LISTEN.

1250
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
AND I THINK IT CAN'T BE

1251
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
EMPHASIZED ENOUGH THAT THIS IS A

1252
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
PERFECT EXAMPLE WHERE RECRUITING

1253
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
THE ASSISTANCE OF TRAINED MENTAL

1254
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IS VITALLY

1255
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
IMPORTANT.
KIDS SOMETIMES CAN'T ASK FOR

1256
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
HELP.

1257
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
BUT ADULTS CAN.

1258
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000

A MOMENT. Capella University
rough economic times  ds

1261

clinical depression.

Drug and alcohol abuse is up.

And those dealing with grief
don't have access to the

professional help they need.

1265
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
When you see these issues, do
you want to walk away or
step up?
