JACK PINTO, NOAH POZNER.

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
IT IS GOING TO BE A TRAGIC

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
SEVERAL WEEKS.
NO ONE KNEW THAT MORE THAN

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO CAME HERE TO

MEMORIAL LAST NIGHT.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
>> SURELY WE DO BETTER THAN

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000

IF THERE IS EVEN ONE STEP WE CAN

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
TAKE TO SAVE ANOTHER CHILD OR

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
ADAM LANZA HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
OFFICIALLY AS THE KILLER.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
THAT IS HIS MOTHER IN BETTER

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
TIMES ON THE RIGHT.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
NANCY LANZA.

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
HER HOME REMAINS A CRIME SCENE.

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
IT WILL REMAIN SO FOR QUITE SOME

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
TIME.
THE POLICE AREN'T GIVING ANY

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
INDICATION RIGHT NOW AS TO A

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
MOTIVE.
THEY SAY THEY ARE ACCUMULATING

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
QUITE A BIT OF EVIDENCE,

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
INCLUDING THE HARD DRIVE OF HIS

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000

SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY ARE

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
NOW WE ARE -- WE ARE NOW HEARING

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
HELP IN THE INVESTIGATION.

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
THE POLICE SAYING TODAY WHEN IT

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
IS APPROPRIATE, WHEN THE TIME IS

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
RIGHT, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
QUESTION THOSE TWO ADULTS

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
FURTHER.
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THOSE

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
600-SOME-ODD KIDS WILL BE ABLE

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
TO RETURN TO SCHOOL.

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THOSE CHILDREN FROM SANDY HOOK

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
ELEMENTARY.

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
WE ARE TOLD THAT SCHOOL IS

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
CLOSED INDEFINITELY UNTIL THEY

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
ARE ABLE TO REOPEN IT.

82
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
BUT IT IS A CRIME SCENE AND

83
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
THERE IS A LOT OF PROCESSING.

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
THIS MORNING, WE WERE TOLD THAT

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
IT COULD BE MONTHS AND MONTHS

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
BEFORE THAT SCHOOL OPENS.

87
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
THE SAME GOES FOR THE LANZA

88
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
FAMILIAR FAMILY HOME.

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
HERE IS THE LATEST WORD FROM THE

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE THIS

91
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
MORNING.

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
>> WE ARE HOLDING BOTH CRIME

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
SCENES, THE SCHOOL AND SECONDARY

94
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
CRIME SCENE, INDEFINITELY.

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
WE SEIZED IT UNDER SEARCH
SXWARPTS WE WILL HOLD THOSE

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
LOCATIONS UNTIL WE HAVE

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
COMPLETED OUR WORK AND WE FEEL

98
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
IT IS APPROPRIATE TO LET THEM

99
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
GO.
IT IS NOT TO READ ANYTHING INTO

100
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
THAT, IT IS COMMON PRACTICE TO

101
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
DO THAT, TO HOLD ON TO THE CRIME

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
SCENE, AS LONG AS AS NEEDED FOR

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
INVESTIGATIVE PURPOSES.

104
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000

I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000

THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PIECE

110
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
TOGETHER SOME KIND OF PLAN NOT

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
ONLY FOR THE KIDS AT SANDY HOOK

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
BUT ALSO ALL OF THE KIDS IN THE

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
DISTRICT HERE IN NEWTOWN.

114
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
WHAT DO THEY KNOW SO FAR?

115
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000

00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
IMPORTANT THE TEACHERS AS WELL.

118
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE.

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
THEY ARE BEEFING AND ADDING

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
OFFICERS.

121
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT IN HIS

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
PRESS CONFERENCE.

123
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
BEEFING UP SECURITY.

124
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
OFFICERS AT SCHOOLS.
THE SCHOOL OFFICERS ARE ALREADY

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
THERE.
THEY WILL MAKE SURE THAT THEY

126
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
HAVE MORE.

127
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DOING, TO

128
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
ASSURE SAFETY AS MUCH AS THEY

129
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
CAN AS POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WHO

130
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
ARE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
AND ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS.

132
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
THEY SAID THEY ARE MEETING WITH

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
TEACHERS AS WELL.

134
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
>> NO ONE TODAY.

135
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000

EXACTLY WHEN THEY WANT TO GO

140
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
BACK.
>> IT IS LIKELY THE REST OF THE

141
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
CHILDREN OUTSIDE OF SANDY HOOK

142
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000

TOMORROW.
OBVIOUSLY WITH A -- WHOLE OTHER

145
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
THE CRISIS THAT HAS HAPPENED.

147
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000

149
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
THERE'S OFTEN A TENSION BETWEEN

161
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
THE POLICE AND THE PRESS AND THE

162
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
PEOPLE.

163
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'M NOT FEELING THAT AS MUCH

164
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
HERE AS I EVER HAVE.

165
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
OR SO KIDS FROM SANDY HOOK, THEY

188
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
ARE NOT GOING TO BE GOING BACK

189
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS TO THAT

190
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
SCHOOL BUT THEY ARE MAKE

191
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
ARRANGEMENTS AT THE CHALK HILL

192
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
SCHOOL IN MONROE.

193
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
>> THAT WAS THE INITIAL WORD.

194
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
WE BOUGHT THE OFFICIAL WORD LAST

195
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
NIGHT.

196
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
AGAIN, AS WE SAY, IT IS A WORK

197
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
IN PROGRESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

198
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
TALK TO PARENTS AND THEY HAVE TO

199
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
TALK INFORM TO TEACHERS AND

200
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
STAFF AND MAKE SURE THAT THE

201
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
FACILITY IS BIG ENOUGH TO TAKE

202
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
IN ALL OF THE STUDENTS THAT ARE

203
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
AT THE SCHOOL HERE, THAT --

204
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
WON'T BE GOING BACK TO THE

205
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
SCHOOL HERE.

206
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I WANT TO SAY THIS JUST BEFORE

207
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
WE GO.

208
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I THOUGHT ONE OF THE PEOPLE I

209
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
SPOKE TO YESTERDAY WHO KNEW

210
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
NANCY LANZA, ONE OF HER FRIENDS,

211
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
SAID OUR TOWN HAS CHANGED

212
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
FOREVER.

213
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
AND IT IS DEFINITELY CHANGED
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

214
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
HE SAYS AS WE WERE TALKING,

215
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
SIRENS WERE GOING OFF.
THERE WAS A MOTORCADE GOING BY

216
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
OF SOME DIGNITARY.

217
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
IT WASN'T THE.
.

218
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
HE SAID IT IS LIKE WE ARE IN THE

219
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
MIDDLE OF A CIRCUS.

220
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
EXCEPT NOBODY IS HAVING FUN WITH

221
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
THIS.

222
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
THAT SUMS UP WHAT IS HAPPENING.

223
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
>> I THOUGHT THAT FRIDAY MIGHT

224
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
AS I WAS DRIVATION WAY FROM THIS

225
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
TOWN LATE.
I THINK IT WAS MID MIGHT WHEN WE

226
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
MIGHT HAVE WRAPPED UP HERE.

227
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I WAS DRIVING ALONG AND SEEING

228
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AND SEEING ALL

229
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
THE LIGHTS ON INSIDE OF THESE

230
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
HOMES.

231
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
REALIZING A LOT OF THESE HOMES

232
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
MAY BE THE ONES PEAKED.

233
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
AND THERE WERE SO MANY THAT I

234
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
THOUGHT THIS TOWN WILL NEVER,

235
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
EVER BE THE SAME.

236
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
WITHOUT QUESTION.

237
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
>> THOSE 20 KIDS WILL NOT BE

238
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
RUNNING DOWN THE STAIRS AND

239
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
BOLTING TOWARDS A CHRISTMAS TREE

240
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
TO SEE WHAT SANTA LEFT THEM.

241
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
INSTEAD THEIR PARENTS ARE TRYING

242
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
TO PICK OUT COFFINS FOR THEM.

243
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
THAT'S A SAD REALITY.

244
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
>> DON, THANK YOU.
STAND BY, IF YOU WILL.

245
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
ALISON KOSIK HAS BEEN WORKING ON

246
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS STORY

247
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
WHICH IS THE INVESTIGATION WHICH

248
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
HAS TO GO ON AS THOSE WHO

249
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
MORNING AND PLAN THEIR BURIALS.

250
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
THOSE POLICE OFFICERS WHO ARE

251
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
NOW BEING DISPATCHED TO COVER

252
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
THE FUNERALS AND DO SECURITY FOR

253
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
FUNERALS ARE ALSO WORKING ON THE

254
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
INVESTIGATION OF ADAM LANZA, WHY

255
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
HE DID WHAT HE DID, HOW HE DID

256
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
WHAT HE DID.

257
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
AND EXACTLY HOW IT ALL

258
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
TRANSPIRED.
STILL A TIMELINE ISN'T VERY

259
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
CLEAR.

260
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
ALISON KOSIK IS LIVE OUT IN

261
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
FRONT OF THE LANZA HOME.

262
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
WHAT ARE YOU FINDING OUT TODAY?

263
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, WE ARE STANDING

264
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
IN FRONT OF THE LANZA HOME.

265
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
IT IS THE ONE BEHIND ME HERE ON

266
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
THE HILL.
IT IS PICTURESQUE WHEN YOU LOOK

267
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
AT IT.

268
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
IT IS HUGE.
SITTING ON A BEAUTIFUL GREEN

269
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
LAWN.
THERE IS A WREATH OVER THE FRONT

270
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
DOOR.
THIS, THOUGH IS STILL AN ACTIVE

271
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
CRIME SCENE AND THE

272
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
INVESTIGATION REALLY DOES

273
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
CONTINUE INTO WHAT ADAM LANZA

274
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
WAS DOING IN THE DAYS AND IN THE

275
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
WEEKS AND MONTHS BEFORE THIS

276
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
MASSACRE ON FRIDAY.

277
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
INVESTIGATORS NOW HAVE PROOF

278
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
THAT THE GUNMAN -- WAS -- AT

279
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
LEAST ONE SHOOTING RANGE.

280
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
THEY ARE NOT SAY WHEN, THEY ARE

281
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
NOT SAYING WHERE.

282
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THEY ARE ALSO SAYING THAT HIS

283
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
MOTHER, NANCY LANZA, WHO ALSO

284
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
LIVED WITH HIM AT THE HOUSE

285
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
BEHIND ME, WHO HE SHOT AND

286
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
KILLED BEFORE HE WENT TO THE

287
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
SCHOOL, THAT SHE ALSO VISITED AT

288
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
LEAST ONE SHOOTING RANGE SEVERAL

289
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
TIMES.

290
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
THEY ARE NOT SAYING WHEN.

291
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
THEY ARE NOT SAYING WHERE.

292
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THERE WAS A PRESS CONFERENCE A

293
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
SHORT TIME AGO WHERE POLICE WERE

294
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
ASKED IF THEY RECOVERED ANYTHING

295
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
FROM A SMASHED HARD DRIVE AND

296
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
THE WAY -- THE LIEUTENANT PUT IT

297
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
IS THAT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING

298
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
ALL ELECTRONIC EVIDENCE IN THIS

299
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
CASE.

300
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
>> I'M JUST CURIOUS, OFTENTIMES

301
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
WHEN WE COVER THESE TRAGEDIES,

302
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
THE PERSON AT THE CENTER IS --

303
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
LEAVES SOME KIND AFTER FOOTPRINT

304
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
BEHIND, FACEBOOK PAGE, TWITTER

305
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
ACCOUNT, PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE

306
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
YEARBOOK.

307
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME KIND OF

308
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
A -- AT LEAST A PHOTOGRAPHIC

309
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
PERSONALITY WE CAN PUT TOGETHER.

310
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
WE CAN GET INTERVIEWS WITH

311
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
PEOPLE WHO KNEW THEM TO AT LEAST

312
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
TRY TO PIECE TOGETHER WHAT KIND

313
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
OF PEOPLE THEY WERE.

314
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE STORIES

315
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
WHERE WE HAVE HAD A TERRIBLY

316
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
DIFFICULT TIME FIGURING OUT WHO

317
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
THIS YOUNG MAN WAS.

318
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
OR EVEN FIND OUT WHAT HE LOOKS

319
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
LIKE.
WHY IS THAT?

320
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
>> IT HAS BEEN VERY TOUGH

321
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
BECAUSE THIS IS A FAMILY THAT --

322
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
MOTHER AND SON WHO LIVED BEHIND

323
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
ME, THEY KEPT TO THEMSELVES.

324
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
THEY REALLY WEREN'T THAT

325
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
SOCIAB

326
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
SOCIABLE.
THAT'S WHAT WE HEAR FROM

327
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
NEIGHBORS.
WE KNOW WHAT HE DID ON FRIDAY,

328
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
CAME OUT INTO THE OPEN.

329
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
HE SHOT HIS WAY IN A THAT

330
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
SCHOOL.
HE FIRED DOZENS OF BULLETS INTO

331
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
HIS VICTIMS, USING A

332
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPON.

333
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
DID YOU KNOW HE HAD HUNDREDS OF

334
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
UNUSED BULLETS ON HIM.

335
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
HE WAS REALLY OUT TO KILL.

336
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
AND -- AT THE SAME NEWS

337
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
CONFERENCE I'M TALKING ABOUT,

338
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
SOMEONE HAD ASKED THE

339
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
LIEUTENANT, WAS HE OUT TO KILL

340
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THAT MUCH?

341
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
THE POLICE DIDN'T WANT TO GO

342
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
THAT FAR.
LISTEN HOW POLICE PUT IT.

343
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
>> I CAN'T SPECULATE WHAT WOULD

344
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
HAVE OCCURRED.

345
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
THAT WOULD BE WRONG ON MY PART.

346
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE --

347
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
FACULTY AND STAFF IN THAT SCHOOL

348
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
DID EVERYTHING THAT THEY

349
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
POSSIBLY COULD TO PROTECT THOSE

350
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
CHILDREN.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FIRST

351
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
RESPONDERS THAT GOT THERE AT THE

352
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
SCENE AND ENTERED THE SCHOOL AND

353
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
SAVED MANY HUMAN LIVES.

354
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I CAN TELL YOU IT BROKE OUR

355
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
HEARTS WE COULDN'T SAVE THEM

356
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
ALL.
>> AUTHORITIES FOUND THREE

357
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
WEAPONS IN THE CLASSROOM INSIDE

358
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
OF THAT SCHOOL.

359
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
AND THEY FOUND ONE OTHER WEAPON,

360
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
FOURTH WEAPON, SHOTGUN INSIDE OF

361
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
HIS CAR THAT WAS PARKED IN THE

362
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
SCHOOL PARKING LOT.

363
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
>> ALL RIGHT, ALISON KOSIK FOR

364
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
US LIVE THIS MORNING.

365
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

366
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
>>> OBVIOUSLY THE POLICE HAVE

367
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
SAID THAT THEY HAVE AN

368
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF WORK

369
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
AHEAD OF THEM.
NOT ONLY ARE THEY PROCESSING

370
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
THAT SCHOOL AS A CRIME SCENE,

371
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000

PLAN IN THE PAST.

1006
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000

LOOKING AT WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE

1029
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000

1031
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000

1032
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
FORWARD?
>> SURE.

BASED ON THIS ACTION PLAN, WHAT

1034
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
WE HAVE DONE AND WILL CONTINUE

1035
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
TO DO FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS IS

1036
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
WE HAVE TAKEN EVERY OFFICER

1037
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
THAT'S NOT ALREADY ASSIGNED TO

1038
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
PATROL AND NOT ALREADY

WE HAVE TAKEN THEM AND ASSIGNED

1043
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
THEM TO EACH OF THE 102 SCHOOLS

1044
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
IN OUR DISTRICT.

1045
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
WE HAVE AN OFFICER STATIONED AT

1046
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000

1047
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
NEXT THREE DAYS WHEN WE WILL

1048
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
RE-EVALUATE TODAY AND SEE WHERE

1049
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
WE STAND AND WHERE THE NATION

1050
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
STANDS WITH THE REACTION TO THIS

1051
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
INCIDENT.

1052
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
>> CORPORAL SMITH, I WANT TO ASK

1053
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
YOU SOMETHING AND IT IS ON A

1054
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
SEMI PERSONAL LEVEL BUT HAS TO

1055
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
DO WITH YOUR PROFESSIONAL

1056
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
BACKGROUND, TOO.
THIS PERPETRATOR TOOK A

1057
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPON AND SHOT

1058
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
HIS WAY IN THROUGH THE SECURITY

1059
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
SYSTEM.
THE PRINCIPAL HAD JUST

1060
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
IMPLEMENTED A BRAND-NEW SECURITY

1061
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
SYSTEM AT THIS SCHOOL.

1062
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
IT WAS THE SAFE AS ANY SCHOOL

1063
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY CAN BE.

1064
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
THIS AUTOMATIC WEAPON WAS NO --

1065
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
THERE WAS NO MATCH FOR IT.

1066
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
AND IN THAT LIGHT, AS YOU LOOK

1067
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000

OFFICERS AND POLICE ASSOCIATIONS

00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY LOOK TO TRY

1071
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
TO PROTECT THEIR KIDS, IS

1072
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
THERE -- IS THERE REALLY

1073
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO WHEN

1074
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
FACED WITH WEAPONS LIKE THESE

1075
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
THAT ARE OUT THERE?

1076
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
>> IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT

1077
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
QUESTION TO ANSWER.

1078
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
IT GETS INTO A LOT OF ANGLES

1079
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
THAT I CAN'T DISCUSS WITH YOU

1080
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
HERE TODAY.

1081
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
POLICE DEPARTMENTS AROUND THE

1082
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
COUNTRY HAVE CHANGED THEIR

1083
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ON HOW

1084
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
WE RESPOND TO CERTAIN INCIDENTS

1085
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
LIKE THIS.

1086
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
IN THE WAKE OF COLUMBINE, MANY

1087
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
POLICE DEPARTMENTS WENT TO A

1088
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
PATROL RIFLE PROGRAM WHERE

1089
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
POLICE OFFICERS WILL BE ACTUALLY

1090
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
ARMED WITH MORE SUITABLE WEAPONS

1091
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
FOR DEALING WITH SOMEONE WHO IS

1092
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
ARMED AND IN SUCH A WAY.

1093
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION

1094
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
TO ANSWER WHEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT

1095
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
SECURING A SILT LIKE THE SCHOOL

1096
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
OR SHOPPING MALL OR MOVIE

1097
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
THEATER OR ANYTHING ALONG THOSE

1098
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
LINES.
IT IS ONE I'M NOT PREPARED TO

1099
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
ANSWER.

1100
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
>> OF COURSE, THOSE POLICE OFTEN

1101
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
GET THE CALL AFTER THOSE WEAPONS

1102
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
HAVE BEEN DISCHARGED.

1103

LOT OF OPTIMISM IN RECENT DAYS

1376
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000

WHERE THE DISCUSSIONS ARE.

1402
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
THIS MOSTLY COMES FROM EXCELLENT

1403
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
REPORTING FROM OUR CONGRESSIONAL

1404
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
PRODUCER, DEIRDRE WALSH.

1405

AND THAT IS ROUGHLY A $2

1406
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
TRILLION FRAMEWORK.

1407
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
REPUBLICANS ARE PUSHING THE

1408
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
CONVERSATIONS RIGHT NOW.

SPENDING CUTS.

1413
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE SOURCES IN

00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
BOTH PARTIES MADE CLEAR THAT

1415
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

1416
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
REPUBLICANS ARE PUSHING NOW.

1417
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
THE BIG QUESTION, WHEN YOU TALK

1418
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
ABOUT THE OVERALL POTENTIAL DEAL

1419
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
ON THIS ESPECIALLY, I'M TOLD

1420
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
FROM DEMOCRATIC SOURCES IS

1421
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
WHETHER OR NOT THE SPENDING

1422
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
SIDE, $1 TRILLION IN SPENDING

1423
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
CUTS, IS SOMETHING THAT CAN PASS

1424
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE,

1425
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE WHAT

1426
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A LOT

1427
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
OF CUTS TO MEDICARE.

1428
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THE

1429
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
DEMOCRATS HAVE RESISTED.

1430
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
SO THIS IS STILL FLUID.

1431
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
YOU KNOW WHAT, ASHLEIGH?

1432
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000

IT LASTED 45 MINUTES.

1435
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET A LITTLE

1436
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
MORE DETAIL.
JUST THE FACT THAT THEY'RE

1437
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
TALKING FACE TO FACE IS A GOOD

1438
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
SIGN.
>> Reporter: AND OBVIOUSLY THE

1439
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000

JUST WANT TO WRAP UP FROM HERE

1444
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, IF I

1445
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
CAN.
THERE WILL BE TWO FUNERALS

1446
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
TAKING PLACE FOR TWO OF THE

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000

ALSO NO SCHOOL FOR ANY OF THE

1451
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
CHILDREN IN THIS DISTRICT.

1452
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
AND THEY'LL BE RETURNING

1453
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
TOMORROW.
BUT NOT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

1454
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
THEY WILL NOT BE RETURNING.

1455
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
THERE ARE ALTERNATE PLANS BEING

1456
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
MADE FOR THEM.

1457
