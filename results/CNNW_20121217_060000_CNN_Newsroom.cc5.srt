1
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
>>> I WISH TO GOD SHE HAD HAD AN

2
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
M4 IN HER OFFICE LOCKED UP SO

3
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
WHEN SHE HEARD GUNFIRE SHE PULLS

4
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
IT OUT AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
LUNGE HEROICALLY WITH NOTHING IN

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
HER HANDS, BUT SHE TAKES HIM

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
OFF, TAKES HIS HEAD OFF BEFORE

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
HE COULD KILL THOSE PRECIOUS

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
KIDS.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
>> SAYING SOMETHING MANY

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
AMERICANS ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
FRANK BRUNI, WHEN I HEAR THAT, I

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
JUST DESPAIR, BUT IT IS A VIEW

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
MANY AMERICANS HAVE.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
POLLS SUGGEST THAT IF THE

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
TEACHERS HAD ALL BEEN ARMED, ONE

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
WOULD HAVE SHOT THE GUY AND

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
>> IF POLICE OFFICERS CAN'T FIRE

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
WITH AN ACCURACY, THEY CAN'T

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
FIRE.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
WHY WOULD WE BELIEVE TEACHERS IN

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
SCHOOLS WOULD HAVE WONDERFUL

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
MARKSMANSHIP AND WOULD MAKE THIS

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
A BETTER THING.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
IT DEFIES COMMON SENSE.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
>> IT CANNOT BE TRUE.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
AMERICA HAS THE MOST GUNS OF ANY

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
>> AND THE MOST GUN RELATED

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
DEATHS.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
>> TWICE AS MANY AS ANYBODY
ELSE.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
THE PENNY DOESN'T SEEM TO DROP

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
WITH MANY PEOPLE.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
>> I'VE BEEN WRITING ON AND OFF

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
SINCE THEN 15 YEARS, STATES HAVE

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
GOTTEN MORE LAX.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DONE

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
ANYTHING.
WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT WE'RE

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
MADE OF.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHETHER

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
WE'RE WILLING TO DO ANYTHING.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
>> I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA IS

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
EMOTIONAL NOW, HE SAID THIS IS

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
THE FOURTH TIME TO COMFORT

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
COMMUNITIES TORN APART BY

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
SHOOTINGS.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
SIX OF THE WORST SHOOTINGS HAVE

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
HAPPENED SINCE 2007.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
THIS IS BORDERING ON AN

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
EPIDEMIC.
>> IT'S NOT BORDERING ANYMORE.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
IT IS AN EPIDEMIC.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I THINK SOMETHING WILL CHANGE.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I WATCHED YOUR SHOW FRIDAY.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
THE AMOUNT OF OUTRAGE WAS HIGHER

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
THAN I'VE SEEN.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I THINK ABOUT THE OPENING OF

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE LAST NIGHT

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
WITH THAT RENDITION OF SILENT

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
NIGHT.
IT FEELS LIKE PEOPLE HAVE HAD

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
ENOUGH.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
HE SAID WE HAVE ANG OBLIGATION

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
TO TRY.
I THINK WE ALL FINALLY REALIZE

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
WHETHER SOMETHING WILL WORK OR

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
NOT WE CAN'T JUST SAY THE

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN DIDN'T WORK

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
SO WELL, LET'S TRY SOMETHING

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
LIKE IT.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO TRY.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
THERE'S ALL OF THESE DEAD

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
CHILDREN THAT ARE NOT GOING TO

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
LIVE TO SEE TOMORROW.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
WE OWE THEIR MEMORIES THE, OUR

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
BEST EFFORT EVEN IF IT'S A

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
FLAWED EFFORT.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
>> THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
SYSTEM.
ON GUNS, IT HAS TO BE A SPECIFIC

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
DEBATE.
IT'S NO GOOD SAYING BAN GUNS.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN IN

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
AMERICA AND THERE'S TOO MANY OUT

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
THERE.
THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN, I DON'T

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
BELIEVE IT WAS AN INEFFECTUAL AS

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
THEY WOULD LIKE US TO HAVE US

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
BELIEVE.

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
ALLOWING THEM TO COME BACK IN,

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
WHY DOES ANY YOUNG MAN IN

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
AMERICA OR WOMAN, THEY'RE ALL

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
MEN AT THE MOMENTUM NEED ONE OF

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
THESE AR-15 RIFLES.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
>> OR THE HIGH CAPACITY CLIPS.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
EVEN IF WE ENFORCE IT IN A

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
FLAWED FASHION THAT PREVENTS ONE

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
OF THESE MASSACRES OR PREVENTS

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
FIVE DEATHS A YEAR, DON'T WE OWE

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
IT TO THE COUNTRY AND THE

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
CHILDREN OF THE COUNTRY TO TRY

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
THAT?

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
>> DO YOU THINK THE SCALE OF

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW TOWN MEANS

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
THIS IS THE TIPPING POINT?
>> I THINK WHAT MAKES IT THE

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
TIPPING POINT IS WHERE IT COMES

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
IN THE SEQUENCE AND THE AGE OF

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
THE VICTIMS.
>> WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
KIDS THIS AGE, I THINK THAT'S
WHAT REALLY GOT TO PEOPLE.

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
>> FRANK, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
>>> AFTER THE BREAK, WE'RE GOING

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
TO REMEMBER THOSE VICTIMS IN

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
SILENCE.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
EACH OF THEM BY NAME AND

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
PICTURE.

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
>>> WE LEAVE YOU TONIGHT WITH
THE NAMES AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
VICTIMS OF THE SANDY HOOK

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
TRAGEDY.
20 CHILDREN AND SIX TEACHERS WHO

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
MUST NEVER BE FORGOTTEN.

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
HERE THEY ARE.

116
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
>>> SADLY THE DAYS AHEAD WON'T

117
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
GET ANY BETTER.

118
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
THERE ARE MANY DIFFICULT DAYS

119
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
AND WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD.

120
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
STARTING TOMORROW PARENTS WILL

121
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
BEGIN BURYING THEIR CHILDREN.

122
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
TRYING TO IMAGINE IT IS ALMOST

123
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
UNTHINKABLE.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND THE

124
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
WORDS.

125
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
ALL THE WORDS WE'LL SAY IN THIS

126
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
HOUR WILL SEEM SO SMALL IN FACE

127
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
OF THE TRAGEDY THAT'S OCCURRED

128
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
HERE.

129
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
NOW IS THE TIME TO LEAN ON ONE

130
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
ANOTHER.
THEY CAME TOGETHER TONIGHT FOR A

131
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
VIGIL CROWDING TO THE LOCAL HIGH

132
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
SCHOOL JUST BEHIND ME.

133
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

134
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
TO LISTEN AS SPIRITUAL LEADERS

135
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
FROM EVERY MAJOR FAITH OFFERED

136
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
ANY WORDS OF COMFORT THEY COULD.

137
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE AND SAID

138
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
THAT WE AS A NATION ARE NOT

139
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
DOING ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR

140
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
CHILDREN SAFE.

141
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
HE PROMISED TO WORK TO PUT AN

142
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
END TO FUTURE TRAGEDIES LIKE

143
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
THIS ONE.
WE'LL PLAY YOU HIS CALL FOR

144
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
ACTION SHORTLY.
WE DON'T WANT TO FOCUS ON THE

145
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
KILLER.
FOR THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS WE

146
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
HAVEN'T SAID HIS NAME.

147
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I DON'T WANT HISTORY TO REMEMBER

148
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
HIM.
WE AND THE HISTORY WANT PEOPLE

149
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
TO REMEMBER THE TEACHERS AND THE

150
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
CHILDREN AND THOSE WHOSE LIVES

151
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
HAVE BEEN SO UNFORTUNATELY

152
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
TAKEN.

153
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
PEOPLE WITH HOPES AND WITH

154
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
DREAMS AND WITH STORIES.

155
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
EVEN THOUGH 20 OF THOSE STORIES

156
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
HAD ONLY JUST BEGUN.

157
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THEIR

158
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
LIVES FROM PARENTS AND FRIENDS

159
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
AND LOCAL AND NATIONAL PAPERS

160
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
AND LOCAL BLOGS.

161
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
THERE WAS A VIGIL IN AURORA,

162
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
COLORADO, EVERY TIME A VICTIM

163
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
WAS READ THE CROWD SAID WE WILL

164
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
REMEMBER.
I THOUGHT I'D TAKE TIME TO

165
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
REMEMBER YOU EACH OF THE NAMES

166
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
OF EVERY CHILD AND EVERY GROWN

167
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
UP AND TELL YOU WHAT QUESTION

168
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
ABOUT THEIR LIVES.

169
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
CHARLOTTE BACON WAS SIX YEARS

170
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
OLD.

171
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
SHE WAS WEARING A NEW PINK DRESS

172
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
AND BOOTS AND HOLIDAY OUTFIT.

173
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
SHE BEGGED HER MOM TO WEAR IT TO

174
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
SCHOOL THAT DAY.

175
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
HER BIG BROTHER WAS ALSO AT

176
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
SCHOOL THAT DAY.

177
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
WE'RE TOLD HE MADE IT TO SAFELY.

178
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
HER UNCLE SAID SHE COULD LIGHT

179
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
UP A ROOM.

180
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
WE'LL ALSO REMEMBER DANIEL

181
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
BARDEN, 7 YEARS OLD.

182
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
HE WAS A BUDDING ATHLETE.

183
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
HE SWAM, PLAYED SOCCER, WAS

184
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
MISSING TWO FRONT TEETH.

185
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
HIS FAMILY CALLED HIM FEARLESS.

186
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
NATION.

373
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I AM VERY MINDFUL THAT MERE

374
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
WORDS CANNOT MATCH THE DEPTHS OF

375
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
YOUR SORROW.

376
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
NOR CAN THEY HEAL YOUR WOUNDED

377
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
HEARTS.

378
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I CAN ONLY HOPE IT HELPS FOR YOU

379
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN

380
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
YOUR GRIEF THAT OUR WORLD TOO

381
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
HAS BEEN TORN APART.

382
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
THAT ALL ACROSS THIS LAND OF

383
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
OURS, WE HAVE WEPT WITH YOU.

384
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
WE'VE PULLED OUR CHILDREN TIGHT.

385
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
AND YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHATEVER

386
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
MEASURE OF COMFORT WE CAN

387
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
PROVIDE, WE WILL PROVIDE.

388
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
>> WITH ME NOW ARE TWO CLERGY

389
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
MEMBERS WHO SPOKE AT THE VIGIL.

390
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
SENIOR MINISTER OF THE NEWTOWN

391
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH.

392
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO COME OUT OF

393
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
THIS?

394
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW?

395
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
>> I'M HOPING, ANDERSON, THIS
WILL BE THE TIPPING POINT IN OUR

396
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
COUNTRY.

397
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I FEEL THAT CHILDREN ARE

398
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
INUNDATED WITH THE CULTURE OF

399
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
VIOLENCE FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE.

400
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
FROM THE TOYS THAT WE PLAY WITH

401
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
TO THE MOVIES THAT WE SEE AND

402
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
THE TV THAT WE SEE.

403
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
THAT WE CAN DO BETTER, AND WE

404
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
CAN MAKE GAMES THAT ARE EXCITING

405
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
THAT HAVE A POSITIVE OBJECTIVE.

406
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
AND WE REALLY NEED TO DO THAT,

407
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S TOO

408
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
COMMONPLACE, THE VIOLENT
REACTION.

409
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
OF COURSE, THE INDIVIDUAL IS

410
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
DERANGED BUT THERE'S A PART OF

411
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
ME THAT THINKS IF WE HAD MORE OF

412
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
A CULTURE OF PEACE THAT THESE

413
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
KIND OF EVENTS WOULD BE LESS

414
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
LIKELY TO HAPPEN.

415
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
>> WHAT ARE YOU HOPING COMES OUT

416
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
OF THIS?

417
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
>> WELL, I'M HOPING FOR OUR

418
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
COMMUNITY THAT THE COMMUNITY

419
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
GROWS EVEN CLOSER AND STRONGER.

420
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT

421
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
HOW CLOSE AND STRONG IT WAS
BEFORE.

422
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
BUT AS YOU KNOW, A TRAGEDY LIKE

423
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
THIS, WE'RE VERY VULNERABLE.

424
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
BUT I ALSO HAVE HOPE THAT WE CAN

425
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
BECOME STRONGER AND CLOSER AND

426
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
CARE FOR ONE ANOTHER IN DEEPER

427
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
WAYS.

428
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
>> IT'S EXTRAORDINARY JUST THE

429
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
LAST COUPLE DAYS, I'VE BEEN

430
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
HERE.

431
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
COMPLETE STRANGERS COME UP TO

432
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
ONE ANOTHER ON THE STREET AND

433
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
ARE HUGGING AND SHARING, SHARING

434
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
THEIR HEARTS WITH EACH OTHER.

435
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
>> THERE'S AN OUTPOURING.

436
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
NOT ONLY IN THE TOWN, BUT FOR

437
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD.

438
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
AND -- BUT THAT WILL SLOWLY

439
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
DISSIPATE.

440
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
AND THE ATTENTION WILL DISAPPEAR

441
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
FROM THIS PLACE, AND WE'LL BE

442
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
RETURNING TO LIVES THAT ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE NORMAL.

443
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
FOR MANY PEOPLE, THEY WON'T FEEL

444
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
NORMAL AGAIN.

445
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
HOW DO WE MAKE THOSE LIVES FEEL

446
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
CONNECTED AND CLOSER AND CARED

447
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
FOR, AND VIBRANT?

448
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS EVENT

449
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
TO DEFINE THE SPIRIT OF OUR

450
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
FAITH COMMUNITIES, THE SPIRIT OF

451
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
THIS COMMUNITY.
WE WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT

452
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
THERE IS SOMETHING MORE,

453
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
SOMETHING HOPEFUL, SOMETHING

454
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
THAT WE CAN EVEN BECOME MORE

455
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
COMPASSIONATE, MORE CARING, SOME

456
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
OF THE THINGS THAT WE JUST

457
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
TALKED ABOUT, HOW WE SEE PEOPLE

458
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
NOT JUST HERE IN TOWN, BUT IN

459
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
THE WORLD.

460
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
>> I'VE SEEN REPRESENTATIVES AND

461
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
MEMBERS ON THE STAGE.
IT WAS A POWERFUL MOVING

462
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
STATEMENT.

463
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
WHAT DO YOU -- HOW -- THERE'S SO
MANY PARENTS AROUND THE WORLD

464
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
WHO ARE FOLLOWING THIS, WHO

465
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THEIR

466
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
CHILDREN, DON'T KNOW HOW TO

467
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
EXPLAIN IT.

468
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
HOW DO YOU COUNCIL SOMEBODY.

469
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM?

470
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
>> YOU MEAN, AROUND THE COUNTRY?

471
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
>> YEAH, OR HERE, ANYWHERE.

472
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
>> WE HAVE YOUNG ONES TOO, WE

473
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
HAVE FIRST GRADERS, WE WANT THEM

474
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
TO KNOW THAT SOMETHING BAD
HAPPENED.

475
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
WE HAVE TO TELL THEM SOMETHING.

476
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
WE HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING YET.

477
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
IT'S VERY UNUSUAL AND THE BAD

478
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
MAN CAN'T HURT ANYBODY ANY MORE.
THAT'S HOW WE WOULD, AS FIRST

479
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
GRADERS WE WOULD APPROACH THAT.

480
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
AND WE JUST NEED TO WORK TO MAKE

481
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
OUR COMMUNITY BETTER, AND NOT TO

482
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
BE AFRAID.

483
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
YOU'RE SAFE.

484
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
>> NO DOUBT YOU'VE HAD TO

485
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
COUNCIL PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST

486
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
LOVED ONES, WHAT DO YOU SAY IN

487
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
THAT -- IS THERE ANYTHING TO

488
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
SAY?

489
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
>> THERE ARE THINGS TO SAY, BUT

490
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I THINK OFTEN TIMES WE'RE

491
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
INCLINED TO WANT TO SAY THINGS

492
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
FIRST.

493
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I THINK LISTENING IS THE FIRST

494
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
RESPONSE, IS TO LISTEN TO

495
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
PEOPLE'S GRIEF, LISTEN TO WHAT

496
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
THEY'RE -- EVEN IF THEY CAN'T

497
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
ARTICULATE NOT COMING IN

498
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
THINKING THAT A CERTAIN WORD,

499
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
PHRASE OR EVEN PEOPLE OF FAITH,

500
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
CERTAIN SCRIPTURES WILL JUST

501
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
SOLVE OR HEAL INSTANTLY.

502
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
BUT THOSE WORDS OF SCRIPTURE,

503
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
THOSE WORDS ARE SIGNIFICANT.

504
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
BUT REALIZING THAT WE HAVE TO

505
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
CONTINUE TO LISTEN AND TO FIND

506
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
APPROPRIATE WAYS WITH THEM TO

507
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
FIND EXPRESSION AND A MEANING

508
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
THAT COME OUT OF OUR TRADITIONS.

509
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
FOLKS I COUNCIL IN MY OWN

510
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
TRADITION.

511
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
THAT WOULD BE WHAT I DROP ON.

512
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
>> THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS

513
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
SOMETHING -- THAT PAIN NEVER

514
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
GOES AWAY.

515
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
>> IT'S REALLY HORRIBLE.

516
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
AND WHEN YOU SEE THE PARENTS

517
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
WAILING LIKE THAT, YOU REALIZE,

518
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
THAT'S HOW WE WOULD BE IF WE

519
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
WERE THERE TOO.

520
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
THESE ARE ALL OF OUR CHILDREN.

521
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
AND SO -- I THINK MATT SAID IT

522
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
VERY WELL, YOU TAKE YOUR CUES,

523
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
SOME PEOPLE WILL LIKE A

524
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
THEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION.

525
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
NOAH'S MOTHER, I TOLD HER THIS

526
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
MORNING, WHERE IS THE 6-YEAR-OLD

527
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
INSIDE OF YOU READY TO GO?

528
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
AND SHE SAID, WELL, IT'S STILL

529
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
IN ME.

530
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
IN A SENSE, THERE'S A SPIRITUAL

531
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
IDEA THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT,

532
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
THERE'S A TRANSFORMATION, AS WE,

533
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
THROUGH NATURE GROW OUR

534
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
6-YEAR-OLD IS STILL SURROUNDED

535
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
BY THE GREATER ASPECT OF

536
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
OURSELVES AS WE GROW AND MATURE.

537
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
AND SO IT'S A LEAP OF FAITH TO

538
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
SAY AFTER WE LEAVE OUR BODY THAT
WE BECOME PART OF A GREATER

539
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
MATRIX OR A GREATER MOTIF IN THE

540
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
UNIVERSE.

541
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
>> I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU FOR

542
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
BEING WITH US TONIGHT, BUT ALSO

543
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
JUST BEING ON THE STAGE AND WHAT

544
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
YOU SAID, I THOUGHT IT WAS
EXTRAORDINARILY POWERFUL.

545
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
>> THANK YOU.

546
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
>> THANK YOU.

547
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
>> WISH YOU THE BEST.

548
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
>>> WHEN WE COME BACK,

549
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
REMEMBERING PRINCIPAL DAWN

550
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
HOCHSPRUNG.

551
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'M WITH HER HUSBAND AND

552
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
CHILDREN.

553
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

554
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
>>> THE PRINCIPAL WHO -- GOD
BLESS HER LOST HER LIFE.

555
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
SHE WAS A VERY SPECIAL PERSON.

556
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
AND ALL THE PARENTS KNEW THAT.

557
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
>> THE PRINCIPAL OF SANDY HOOK

558
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
ELEMENTARY WAS RESPECTED AND

559
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
ADMIRED BY THE TEACHERS AND

560
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
PARENTS AND LOVED BY THE

561
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
STUDENTS AS WELL.

562
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
DAWN HOCHSPRUNG WAS HER NAME,

563
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
SHE BECAME PRINCIPAL TWO YEARS

564
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
AGO, SHE WAS A MOM OF ONE OF THE

565
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
FIRST GRADERS, SHE NEVER SAW HER

566
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
WITHOUT A SMILE, ON THAT AWFUL

567
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
DAY AT THAT SCHOOL WHO SURVIVED,

568
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
SAY DAWN DIED PROTECTING THEM,

569
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
CONFRONTING THE GUNMAN HERSELF.

570
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
IT WAS A TERRIBLE LOSS OF A

571
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
BELOVED PRINCIPAL, MORE

572
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
IMPORTANTLY, OF A WIFE, MOTHER

573
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
AND GRANDMOTHER.

574
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
TONIGHT HER DAUGHTER POSTED THIS

575
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
PICTURE ON TWITTER OF PRESIDENT

576
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
OBAMA HOLDING DAWN HOCHSPRUNG'S

577
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
GRANDDAUGHTER.

578
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
MY MOM WOULD BE SO PROUD TO SEE

579
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HOLDING HER

580
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
DAUGHTER.

581
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
BUT NOT AS PROUD AS I AM ABOUT

582
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
HER.

583
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
GARY TUCHMAN SPOKE TO THE FAMILY

584
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
ABOUT WHAT A WONDERFUL WOMAN SHE

585
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
WAS.

586
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
>> Reporter: SHE WAS QUITE A BIT

587
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
YOUNGER THAN HER HUSBAND GEORGE,

588
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED TEN YEARS

589
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
AGO, GEORGE WAS MARRYING HIS

590
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
BOSS.

591
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
>> SHE WAS AN ASSISTANT

592
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
PRINCIPAL AT OUR SCHOOL, AND I

593
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
WAS A 7th GRADE MATH TEACHER AT

594
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
THAT TIME.

595
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
AND I JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH

596
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
HER.

597
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
>> GEORGE MADE THE BIG DECISION,

598
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
THE TIME HAD COME TO PROPOSE.

599
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
>> SHE TURNED ME DOWN FIVE

600
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
TIMES.

601
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
>> YOU ASKED HER TO MARRY YOU,

602
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
BUT SHE TURNED YOU DOWN?
>> FIVE TIMES.

603
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE SIXTH TIME?

604
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
>> THE SIXTH TIME I WAITED UNTIL

605
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
IT WAS NOT SUCH ROUGH SAILING.

606
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
WE GOT MARRIED ON THE SWOOP OUT

607
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
OF MYSTIC.

608
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
BETH, AMY AND ANN ARE GEORGE'S

609
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
DAUGHTERS FROM HIS FIRST

610
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
MARRIAGE.

611
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
ERICA IS DAWN'S DAUGHTER FROM

612
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
HER FIRST MARRIAGE.

613
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
HER OTHER DAUGHTER WAS OUT WHILE

614
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
WE WERE AT THE HOUSE.

615
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
THEY'RE A BLENDED BUT VERY CLOSE

616
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
FAMILY WITH 11 GRANDCHILDREN.

617
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
>> WE BUILT THIS BEAUTIFUL HOUSE

618
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
IN THE ADIRONDACKS, THE DREAM
WAS -- IT WAS GOING TO BE DAWN'S

619
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
HOUSE, BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO

620
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
DIE.

621
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I'M MUCH OLDER THAN DAWN.

622
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
IT WAS GOING TO BE HER HOUSE AND

623
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN

624
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
COULD USE THE HOUSE ON THE LAKE.

625
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
THERE WOULD BE ROOMS DOWN STAIRS

626
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
FOR KIDS.

627
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
IT WAS GOING TO BE DAWN'S HOUSE

628
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
ULTIMATELY WITH ALL THE

629
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
CHILDREN.

630
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
ALL THE CHILDREN.

631
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
AND NOW IT'S ME.

632
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I CAN'T -- I DON'T THINK I CAN

633
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
DO THAT.

634
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
>> I WANT TO REITERATE TO YOU,

635
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
GEORGE, HAVE YOU THESE BEAUTIFUL

636
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
DAUGHTERS AND SON IN LAWS AND

637
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
GRANDCHILDREN, AND EVERYONE WILL

638
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
BE HERE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU, IS

639
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
THAT RIGHT, LADIES?

640
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
>> MY JOB HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO

641
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
TAKE CARE OF OTHER PEOPLE?

642
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT IF SOME PEOPLE

643
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
TAKE CARE OF YOU FOR A WHILE?

644
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
>> NO ONE TAKES CARE OF ME.

645
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
>> STOP BEING SO STUBBORN.

646
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
>> IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY

647
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
FRIDAY, THIS IS HOW GEORGE FOUND

648
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

649
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
>> ONE OF THE KIDS CAME UP WITH

650
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
A COMPUTER AND SAID, SOMETHING'S

651
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
HAPPENING AT SANDY HOOK SCHOOL

652
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
AND YOUR WIFE'S BEEN KILLED.

653
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
>> GEORGE RACED OUT OF SCHOOL

654
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
AND INTO A NIGHTMARE, LIKE ALL

655
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
THE FAMILIES OF VICTIMS THEY

656
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
WANT TO KNOW MORE.

657
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
AND ON THIS DAY THEY HAVE

658
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
LEARNED MORE.

659
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
TWO TEACHERS WHO SURVIVED SAID

660
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
THEY WERE HAVING A MEETING WITH

661
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
DAWN WHEN THE SHOTS RANG OUT.

662
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
>> SHE PUT HERSELF IN JEOPARDY,

663
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
AND I HAVE BEEN ANGRY ABOUT THAT

664
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
UNTIL THE TWO WOMEN I MET TODAY,

665
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
SHE TOLD THEM TO RUN TO SHELTER

666
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
WHEN SHE CONFRONTED THE GUNMAN.

667
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
SHE COULD HAVE AVOIDED THAT.

668
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
SHE COULDN'T, I KNEW SHE

669
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
WOULDN'T.

670
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'M NOT ANGRY ANY MORE.

671
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'M NOT ANGRY, I'M JUST VERY

672
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
SAD.

673
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
THEY SAID, WE WERE AT THE

674
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
MEETING, THERE WERE GUNSHOTS.

675
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
SOMEBODY SHOT THE WINDOW,

676
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
SOMEBODY CAME IN, INTO THE --

677
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
NOT INTO THE OFFICE, BUT INTO
THE BUILDING, THE FOYER OF THE

678
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
BUILDING.

679
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
DAWN TOLD US TO GO HIDE, AND SHE

680
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
AND AT LEAST ONE OTHER TEACHER

681
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
RAN OUT AND ACTUALLY TRIED TO

682
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
SUBDUE THE KILLER.

683
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT COMES

684
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
FROM, DAWN WAS ALL OF 5'2".

685
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
>> EVERYONE HERE IS PROUD, NO

686
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
ONE MORE SO THAN ERICA, WHO SAID

687
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
HER MOM WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR HER

688
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
DAUGHTERS.

689
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
>> EVERY GAME, PRACTICE, SHE WAS

690
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
THERE.

691
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
DANCE COMPETITION, SHE WAS DOING

692
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
HOMEWORK ON THE BLEACHERS, BUT

693
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
SHE WAS THERE.

694
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
AND SHE WAS MY ROCK, MY ROCK.

695
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
>> AND NOW SHE IS A HERO TOO.

696
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
>> THE FINAL THING I WANT TO ASK

697
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
YOU IS, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO

698
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
YOUR MOM RIGHT NOW?

699
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
>> COME BACK.

700
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
JUST COME BACK.

701
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
>> GARY TUCHMAN JOINS ME NOW

702
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
LIVE.

703
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I GUESS SOME PEOPLE DON'T

704
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WOULD TALK

705
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

706
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
WHAT I FOUND IS OFTEN TIMES

707
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
PEOPLE WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT

708
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
THEIR LOVED ONE.

709
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT THE LIFE

710
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
THEY LIVED, NOT JUST HOW THEIR

711
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
LIFE ENDED.

712
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT, ANDERSON.

713
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
AND THEY ARE SUCH A WONDERFUL

714
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
AND AMAZING FAMILY.

715
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
WE'RE SO GRATEFUL THEY LET US

716
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
INTO THEIR HOME ON A DAY LIKE

717
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
THIS.

718
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO

719
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
STAY CLOSE AND STAY UNITED.

720
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
THAT'S WHAT WILL GIVE THEM

721
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
STRENGTH.

722
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
OF THE FIVE DAUGHTERS, TWO OF

723
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000

THEIR FATHER GEORGE STRENGTH.

729
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
THEY HAVE A HAPPY EVENT COMING

A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER AT SANDY

HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

741
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
SHE JOINS ME LIVE.

742
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I SPOKE TO YOU ON THE PHONE

743
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
FRIDAY.

744
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU ALL

745
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
WEEKEND.

746
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I THINK HEROES ARE TEACHERS
EVERY DAY AROUND THE COUNTRY.

747
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I FIND -- I JUST THINK WHAT YOU

748
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
DID WAS SO HEROIC.

749
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
YOU -- EXPLAIN AGAIN, YOU
HEARD -- YOU KNEW SOMETHING WAS

750
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
GOING WRONG.

751
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
HOW?
>> WELL, I MEAN WE WERE IN OUR

752
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
CLASSROOM, WE HEARD WHAT SOUNDED

753
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
LIKE GUNSHOTS, NOISES.
>> YOU HEARD THAT --

754
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
>> WELL, THERE WAS A LOUD
SPEAKER, THE PA SYSTEM WAS NOT

755
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
WORKING IN THE WAY IT NORMALLY

756
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
IS, YOU DON'T USUALLY HEAR
THINGS UNLESS SOMEONE MAKES AN

757
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
ANNOUNCEMENT.

758
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
THERE WERE NOISES THAT DIDN'T
SOUND CORRECT.

759
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
THERE WAS NO ONE TELLING US IT

760
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
WAS A DRILL.

761
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
WE TOOK THE CHILDREN AND WENT

762
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
INTO A LOCKDOWN, WE GO TO A

763
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
CERTAIN PLACE IN THE ROOM.

764
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
WE PULL THE BLINDS DOWN, WE LOCK

765
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
THE CLASSROOM DOORS AND WE COVER

766
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
THE WINDOW AT THE DOOR.

767
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
>> THIS IS SOMETHING YOU HAD

768
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
PRACTICED.

769
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
>> ABOUT A MONTH OR SO BEFORE,

770
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
DAWN MAKES SURE WE DO THAT.

771
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
AND WE GO TO A SAFE PLACE AND

772
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
TYPICALLY WHEN IT'S A DRILL THEY

773
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
TELL US, OKAY, AND WE EVEN EXIT

774
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
THE BUILDING FOLLOWING A CERTAIN

775
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
PATH.

776
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
IF THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY WE

777
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
WOULD GO DOWN TO THE SANDY HOOK

778
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
FIREHOUSE AND GATHER THERE,

779
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
WHICH IS WHAT WE DID THAT DAY.

780
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
WE KNEW THAT --

781
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
>> BUT YOU SAT THE KIDS DOWN.

782
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
>> WE SAT IN THE CUBBY AREA,

783
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
AWAY FROM THE DOOR SO NO ONE

784
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
COULD SEE US, READ THEM A STORY,

785
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
TALKED TO THEM.
THEY KEPT SAYING HOW COME WE'RE

786
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
HERE FOR SO LONG.

787
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
WELL, IT WILL BE A LITTLE

788
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
LONGER.

789
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
WHEN THEY'RE FIVE YOU DO

790
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
WHATEVER YOU CAN TO KEEP THEM

791
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
SAFE AND CALM.

792
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
>> THE COURAGE FOR YOU TO BE

793
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
ABLE TO JUST SIT THERE AND READ

794
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
A STORY AND KEEP THEM CALM.

795
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
>> I THINK THE ADRENALINE KICKS

796
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
IN AND YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO

797
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
DO.

798
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
THERE WERE TWO OTHER PEOPLE IN

799
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
THE ROOM THAT WERE HELPING ME

800
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
WITH PULLING DOWN THE BLINDS AND

801
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
THAT, I WAS FOCUSED ON THE KIDS.

802
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
AND JUST KEEPING THEM SAFE.

803
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I'M NOT ABOUT TO TELL THEM THAT

804
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I THINK SOMETHING IS VERY BAD OR

805
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
VERY WRONG.

806
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
WE WAITED AND WAITED.

807
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
IT SEEMED LIKE A VERY LONG TIME.

808
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
MAYBE IT WAS 20 MINUTES A HALF

809
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
HOUR, I'M NOT SURE.

810
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
THERE WERE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR.

811
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
IT WAS POLICE, SOMEONE TELLING

812
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
US THAT WE HAD TO LEAVE.

813
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
DIDN'T WANT TO OPEN THE DOOR AT

814
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
FIRST, BUT WE DID.

815
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
THEY SAID, HAVE THE CHILDREN

816
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
WALK HOLD HANDS, COVER THEIR

817
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
EYES IF THEY COULD -- HE DIDN'T

818
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
SAY WHY, HE JUST SAID HAVE THEM

819
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
DO IT.

820
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
AT 5 IT'S NOT SO EASY TO CLOSE
YOUR EYES AND WALK.

821
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
SO I HAD THEM LOOK TOWARD THE

822
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
WALL.

823
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I SAID, REMEMBER THE ADVENTURE

824
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
WE HAD.

825
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AGAIN.

826
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
>> HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

827
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
>> AGAIN, ADRENALINE.

828
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
YOU ARE MOVING, YOU KNOW YOU

829
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
HAVE TO GET TO SAFETY.

830
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SITUATION WAS

831
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
OCCURRING, WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY
INFORMATION.

832
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
>> HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP NOW?

833
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
>> HOW AM I HOLDING UP NOW?
>> YOU KNEW SOME OF THE KIDS?

834
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
>> TEN OF THEM.

835
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
TEN OF THEM WERE IN MY CLASS

836
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
LAST YEAR.

837
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I WANT TO ATTEND SOME OF THE

838
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
SERVICES, I'M SURE SOME FAMILIES

839
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
WANT PRIVACY.

840
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
THERE'S A FEW CHILDREN WHO I'VE

841
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
HAD NOT JUST THEM, I'VE HAD

842
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
THEIR SIBLINGS AND IN ONE CASE,

843
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I'VE HAD ALL THREE.

844
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
SO OUR FAMILIES WERE CLOSE -- AT

845
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
SANDY HOOK SCHOOL WE'RE A TIGHT

846
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
KNIT GROUP AND WE KNOW -- AND I

847
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY ALSO,

848
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
SO --

849
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
>> AND DAWN AND ALL THE OTHERS.

850
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
OBVIOUSLY -- WHAT DO YOU WANT

851
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT THEM, ABOUT

852
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
THIS COMMUNITY.
>> I WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO

853
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
COME BACK TO SCHOOL.

854
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL COME BACK

855
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
TO SANDY HOOK SCHOOL.

856
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I HEAR WE'RE GOING TO BE

857
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
POSSIBLY MOVED TO ANOTHER

858
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
BUILDING SOMEWHERE ELSE.
WE NEED TO GET THE KIDS BACK IN

859
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
SCHOOL.
WE NEED TO SEE THEM.

860
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
IT WAS HELPFUL TONIGHT TO SEE

861
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
SOME OF THE FAMILIES AND GIVE

862
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
THEM A HUG.
THEY'RE CALLING US ALL HEROES.

863
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
WE DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT.

864
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
WE JUST DID WHAT WE NEEDED TO

865
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
DO.

866
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I WAS ABLE TO TELL EVERYBODY IN

867
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
MY CLASS, YOUR KIDS ARE SAFE.

868
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
THAT MADE ME FEEL GOOD.
>> YOU'RE A HERO TO ME AND I

869
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
THINK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.

870
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I APPRECIATE YOU TALKING TO ME.

871
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
>> THANK YOU.

872
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
OKAY.

873
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
>> AMAZING.

874
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
COMING UP, WE WANT TO PLAY YOU

875

888
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
THE ANSWER IS NO.

889
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000

00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
WAS, SINGING AND PRAISING GOD.

TONIGHT WE REMEMBER ANA, WE

925
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
REMEMBER ALL THE CHILDREN.

EMOTIONAL NIGHT HERE IN NEWTOWN,

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
CONNECTICUT, AS IT HAS BEEN THE

934
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
LAST SEVERAL NIGHTS AS THE

935
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
COMMUNITY CAME TOGETHER.

936
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA MET WITH
VICTIM'S FAMILIES AND SPOKE AT

937
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
THE SERVICE.

938
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
WE WANT TO PLAY YOU MORE OF WHAT

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
SMALL MEASURE OF COMFORT

942
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
TONIGHT.

943
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
>> THIS IS OUR FIRST TASK,

944
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
CARING FOR OUR CHILDREN.

945
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
IT'S OUR FIRST JOB.

946
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
IF WE DON'T GET THAT RIGHT, WE

947
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
DON'T GET ANYTHING RIGHT.

948
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
THAT'S HOW, AS A SOCIETY, WE

949
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
WILL BE JUDGED.

950
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
AND BY THAT MEASURE, CAN WE

951
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
TRULY SAY AS A NATION THAT WE'RE

952
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
MEETING OUR OBGATIONS?

953
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
CAN WE HONESTLY SAY THAT WE'RE

954
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
DOING ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR

955
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
CHILDREN, ALL OF THEM SAFE FROM

956
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
HARM?

957
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
>> I'VE BEEN REFLECTING ON THIS

958
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
THE LAST FEW DAYS, IF WE'RE

959
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
HONEST WITH OURSELVES, THE

960
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
ANSWER IS NO.

961
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH.

962
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
AND WE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE.

963
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
SINCE I'VE BEEN PRESIDENT, THIS

964
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
IS THE FOURTH TIME WE HAVE COME

965
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
TOGETHER TO COMFORT A GRIEVING

966
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
COMMUNITY TORN APART BY MASS
SHOOTINGS.

967
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
FOURTH TIME WE'VE HUGGED

968
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
SURVIVORS.

969
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
FOURTH TIME WE'VE CONSOLED THE

970
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
FAMILIES OF VICTIMS.

971
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
AND IN BETWEEN THERE HAVE BEEN A

972
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
SERIES OF SHOOTINGS, DAILY

973
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
REPORTS OF VICTIMS, MANY OF THEM

974
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
CHILDREN, IN SMALL TOWNS AND BIG

975
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
CITIES ALL ACROSS AMERICA.

976
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
VICTIMS WHOSE MUCH OF THE TIME

977
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
THEY'RE ONLY FAULT WAS BEING IN

978
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG

979
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
TIME.

980
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
WE CAN'T TOLERATE THIS ANY MORE.

981
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
THESE TRAGEDIES MUST END.

982
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
AND TO END THEM WE MUST CHANGE.

983
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
WE WILL BE TOLD THAT THE CAUSES

984
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
OF SUCH VIOLENCE ARE COMPLEX AND

985
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
THAT IS TRUE.

986
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
NO SINGLE LAW, NO SET OF LAWS

987
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
CAN ELIMINATE EVIL FROM THE

988
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
WORLD OR PREVENT EVERY SENSELESS

989
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
ACT OF VIOLENCE IN OUR SOCIETY.

990
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
BUT THAT CAN'T BE AN EXCUSE FOR

991
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
INACTION.

992
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
SURELY WE CAN DO BETTER THAN

993
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
THIS.

994
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
IF THERE'S EVEN ONE STEP WE CAN

995
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
TAKE TO SAVE ANOTHER CHILD OR

996
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
ANOTHER PARENT OR ANOTHER TOWN

997
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
FROM THE GRIEF THAT'S VISITED

998
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
TUCSON AND AURORA AND OAK CREEK

999
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
AND NEWTOWN AND COMMUNITIES

1000
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
BEFORE THAT, THEN SURELY WE HAVE

1001
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
AN OBLIGATION TO TRY.

1002
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
IN THE COMING WEEKS I'LL USE

1003
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE HOLDS

1004
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
TO ENGAGE MY FELLOW CITIZENS

1005
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO MENTAL

1006
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO PARENTS

1007
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
AND EDUCATORS IN AN EFFORT AIMED

1008
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
AT PREVENTING MORE TRAGEDIES

1009
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
LIKE THIS.

1010
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
BECAUSE WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE.

1011
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
WE CAN'T ACCEPT EVENTSES LIKE

1012
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
THIS AS ROUTINE.

1013
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
ARE WE REALLY PREPARED TO SAY

1014
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
THAT WE'RE POWERLESS IN THE FACE

1015
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
OF SUCH CARNAGE?

1016
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
THAT THE POLITICS ARE TOO HARD?

1017
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
ARE WE PREPARED TO SAY THAT SUCH

1018
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
VIOLENCE VISITED ON OUR CHILDREN

1019
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR IS

1020
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
SOMEHOW THE PRICE OF OUR

1021
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
FREEDOM?

1022
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA EARLIER

1023
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
TONIGHT SPEAKING TO HIGH SCHOOL

1024
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
JUST BEHIND US.

1025
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
WOLF BLITZER NOW JOINS ME LIVE.

1026
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I WAS WONDERING ABOUT YOUR

1027
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
THOUGHTS WHILE LISTENING TO THE
PRESIDENT.

1028
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
>> HE DID TONIGHT WHAT HE DIDN'T

1029
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
DO THE EARLIER TIMES, HE TRIED
TO COMFORT THE NATION.

1030
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
HE SPECIFICALLY PROMISED THAT HE

1031
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
WAS GOING TO TAKE STEPS.

1032
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
HE DIDN'T GO INTO DETAILS, TAKE

1033
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
STEPS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT

1034
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
THESE SENSELESS KILLINGS DON'T
HAPPEN AGAIN, EVEN IF YOU CAN

1035
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
SAVE A FEW LIVES.

1036
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
OBVIOUSLY WHAT HE'S REFERRING TO
IS LEGISLATION DEALING WITH GUN

1037
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
CONTROL.
>> AND ALSO MENTAL HEALTH

1038
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
ISSUES.
>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

1039
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
THINGS YOU CAN POTENTIALLY DO.

1040
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
THERE WILL BE A POLITICAL FIGHT.
OBVIOUSLY THE HOUSE OF

1041
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
REPRESENTATIVES IN THE SENATE,

1042
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES.

1043
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
HE DID MAKE THAT COMMITMENT, HE

1044
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
PROMISED HE WAS GOING TO DO, AND

1045
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I THINK MAYOR BLOOMBERG OF NEW

1046
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
YORK WANTS HIM TO DO, NOT JUST

1047
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
TALK A LITTLE BIT, BUT START

1048
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
TAKING ACTION.
>> IT'S SOMETHING HE HAD TALKED

1049
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
ABOUT BEFORE BECOMING PRESIDENT.

1050
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
>> HE DIDN'T JUST HAVE PROBLEMS

1051
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
WITH REPUBLICANS WHO ARE OPPOSED

1052
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
TO STRICTER GUN CONTROL.

1053
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
THERE ARE PLENTY OF DEMOCRATS

1054
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
OUT THERE, THEY THINK IT'S SUCH

1055
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
A LOSING ISSUE.

1056
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
HE HAS A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES, HE

1057
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
HAS A FISCAL CLIFF.

1058
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I THINK HE'S GOING TO DEAL WITH

1059
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
THIS -- YOU KNOW, HE'S IN HIS

1060
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
SECOND TERM, HE DOESN'T THE HAVE

1061
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING

1062
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
RE-ELECTED.

1063
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'LL SUCCEED.

1064
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I'VE BEEN IN WASHINGTON A LONG

1065
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
TIME, GUN CONTROL IS AN ISSUE.

1066
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I THINK HE'S GOING TO TRY.

1067
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
>> A CRIME LIKE THIS HAS SHOCKED

1068
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
THE NATION.
WHETHER IT LEADS TO CHANGE,

1069
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE.
ON THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

1070
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
YOU AND SANJAY WERE TALKING

1071
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
ABOUT THIS EARLIER, MENTAL

1072
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
HEALTH IS ODDLY DEALT WITH IN

1073
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
THIS COUNTRY.

1074
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
IT'S NOT DEALT WITH OR

1075
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
CONSIDERED IN THE SAME WAY AS A

1076
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
DISEASE LIKE CANCER.

1077
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
>> TIPPER GORE, REMEMBER TIPPER

1078
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
GORE, SHE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE,

1079
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
AND TRIED TO BRING IT TO THE

1080
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
FOREFRONT BUT IT'S SORT OF GONE

1081
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
AWAY.

1082
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
GUN CONTROL IS IMPORTANT, BUT

1083
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
MENTAL HEALTH, DEALING WITH

1084
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
THIS, AND TAKING IT OUT OF THE

1085
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
BACK ROWS AND DEALING WITH IT,

1086
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
IF A LOVED ONE SEES A YOUNG KID

1087
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
WHO HAS SOME PROBLEMS, NOT JUST

1088
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
PRETEND THEY DON'T EXIST, THERE

1089
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
ARE MEDICAL TREATMENTS.

1090
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
>> AND ALSO OFTEN TIMES PARENTS

1091
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
CAN'T GET HELP UNLESS THE CHILD

1092
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
CAN BE PROVEN TO BE A DANGER TO

1093
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
THEMSELVES OR OTHERS.

1094
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
AND THAT OFTEN WAITS UNTIL A

1095
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
CRIME IS COMMITTED.

1096
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
>> AND WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH

1097
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
ABOUT THE SHOOTER IN THIS CASE,

1098
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF

1099
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
INDIVIDUALS THIS INDIVIDUAL MAY

1100
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
OR MAY NOT HAVE HAD.

1101
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF

1102
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
TREATMENT HE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE
HAD.

1111
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
DAUGHTER WAS IN THE CLASSROOM

IS OKAY.

1115
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
WAS A STUDENT OF VICTORIA SOTO'S

1116

LAST YEAR.

>>> IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

1161
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN

1162
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
INSIDE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

1163
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
SCHOOL FRIDAY MORNING.

1164
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
THEIR PARENTS RACED TO THE SCENE

1165
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
DESPERATE TO FIND THEIR SONS AND

1166
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
DAUGHTERS.

1167
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
NICOLE AND STEVEN MADDOX LIVED

1168
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
THROUGH THAT PANIC.

1169
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
THEIR DAUGHTER JORDAN IS A

1170
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
SECOND GRADER, THANKFULLY THEY

1171
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
FOUND HER SAFE.

1172
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
HER CLASSROOM WAS JUST ACROSS

1173
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
THE HALL FROM VICTORIA SOTO'S

1174
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM.

1175
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
VICTORIA SOTO DIED TRYING TO

1176
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
SAVE HER STUDENTS.

1177
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
SHE IS 27 YEARS OLD AND IS BEING

1178
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
REMEMBERED TONIGHT AS A HERO.

1179
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I SPOKE A SHORT TIME AGO TO
NICOLE AND STEVEN MADDOX.

1180
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
>> HOW ARE YOU GUYS HOLDING UP,

1181
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
HOW IS JORDAN HOLDING UP?

1182
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
>> I THINK WE'RE DOING OKAY.

1183
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO

1184
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
PROCESS EVERYTHING.

1185
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
WE'RE TRYING TO BE THERE FOR

1186
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
HER, AND SUPPORT HER, AND HELP

1187
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
HER TO DEAL WITH THIS IN HER OWN

1188
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
WAY AND OWN TIME.

1189
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
SHE'S DOING OKAY, IT'S JUST THE

1190
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
NIGHTTIME I THINK IS WHEN SHE

1191
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
REALLY STARTS TO REFLECT ON

1192
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

1193
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
>> THERE'S SO MANY PARENTS

1194
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
AROUND, NOT ONLY THIS TOWN, BUT

1195
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE TRYING

1196
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TALK TO

1197
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
THEIR KIDS ABOUT IT, HOW DO

1198
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
YOU -- DO YOU WAIT FOR JORDAN TO

1199
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
SAY SOMETHING TO YOU?

1200
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH IT?

1201
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
>> I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHAT

1202
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
WE'VE BEEN DOING.

1203
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
JUST BECAUSE WHO KNOWS HOW TO
DEAL WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1204
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
AS THINGS COME UP, SHE ASKS

1205
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
QUESTIONS, YOU ANSWER THEM

1206
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
CALMLY.

1207
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
WHAT HAS --

1208
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
>> WHAT DID SHE SEE, DO YOU

1209
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
>> WHAT DID SHE SEE, DO YOU KNOW

1210
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
>> OR HEAR?
>> WE'VE BEEN GETTING THE STORY

1211
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
SLOWLY FROM HER.

1212
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
THE FIRST TIME SHE TOLD US THE

1213
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
STORY, SHE TOLD US ABOUT HEARING

1214
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
THE GUNSHOTS.

1215
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
HER CLASSROOM IS RIGHT BEHIND
THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE AND THE

1216
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
CONFERENCE ROOM THAT I

1217
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE FOLKS
WERE IN.

1218
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
>> SHE WAS RIGHT ACROSS THE HALL
FROM VICTORIA SOTO'S CLASS?

1219
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
>> WHICH IS SOMETHING SHE WAS

1220
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
EXCITED ABOUT, SHE WOULD BE
GOING JUST ACROSS THE HALL FROM

1221
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
HER FAVORITE TEACHER.

1222
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
THEY SPOKE ALMOST DAILY.
AND THAT WAS THE HARDEST THING

1223
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
TO HAVE TO TELL HER.

1224
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
THAT'S WHEN SHE REALLY BROKE

1225
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
DOWN.

1226
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
SHE HAD BEEN HANDLING MOST OF IT

1227
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
OKAY, BUT WHEN WE TOLD HER ABOUT

1228
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
MISS SOTO THAT'S WHEN SHE TOOK

1229
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
IT THE HARDEST.
>> SHE KNOWS SHE'S DEAD?

1230
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
>> SHE KNOWS NOW.

1231
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
WE WAITED.

1232
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
WE TOLD HER SATURDAY MORNING.

1233
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
>> HOW DO YOU SAY THAT TO A

1234
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
6-YEAR-OLD?

1235
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
>> WE JUST EXPLAINED TO HER, YOU

1236
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

1237
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
AND HONESTLY SHE SAW ENOUGH TO

1238
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WERE

1239
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T WALK OUT OF

1240
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
THERE ALIVE.

1241
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
>> SHE SAW SOMEBODY LAYING

1242
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
THERE?

1243
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
>> SHE SAW THE PRINCIPAL, YEAH.

1244
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
THEY HAD TO WALK THE CHILDREN

1245
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
OUT THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR WHERE

1246
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
HER CLASSROOM IS LOCATED.

1247
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
SHE WALKED PAST THE BODY.

1248
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
ALTHOUGH THEY TOLD THEM TO CLOSE

1249
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
THEIR EYES, I THINK SOME OF THEM

1250
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
WERE KIND OF PEEKING AS KIDS

1251
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
HAVE A TENDENCY TO DO.

1252
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
>> SHE SAW THE PRINCIPAL ON THE

1253
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
FLOOR?

1254
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
>> SHE SAW THE PRINCIPAL, SHE

1255
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
SAW BLOOD, SHE TOLD US ABOUT A

1256
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
LOT OF BROKEN GLASS.

1257
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
>> SO WHEN YOU ACTUALLY TOLD HER

1258
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
THAT HER FORMER TEACHER HAD

1259
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
DIED, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

1260
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
>> UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S VERY

1261
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
SIMPLE.

1262
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
IT'S -- WE CALMLY SAID, JORDAN,

1263
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
SHE WAS ONE OF THE TEACHERS WHO

1264
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
PASSED AWAY.

1265
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
SHE HAD A MOMENT WHERE SHE

1266
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
PAUSED AND HER EYES GOT REAL
WIDE, AND SHE JUST -- YOU COULD

1267
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
SEE HER HEART SINK.

1268
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
AND --

1269
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
>> DOES A 6-YEAR-OLD KNOW -- I

1270
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
MEAN, MY DAD DIED WHEN I WAS 10.

1271
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I'M NOT SURE LOOKING BACK ON IT,

1272
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
THAT I UNDERSTOOD FULLY WHAT

1273
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
THAT MEANT AT THE TIME.

1274
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
>> I THINK CHILDREN ARE

1275
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
RESILIENT AND THEY CAN HEAR THE

1276
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
COLD HARD TRUTH OF SOMETHING AND

1277
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
TAKE THAT IN.

1278
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
IT MAY TAKE YEARS TO PROCESS,

1279
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
BUT MY ADVICE TO PARENTS IS

1280
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
DON'T TRY TO COVER IT UP OR --

1281
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
WHEN DEATH HAPPENS OR HORRIBLE

1282
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
THINGS HAPPEN, YOU HAVE TO FIND

1283
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
A WAY TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOUR

1284
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
CHILDREN.

1285
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
IN A LOT OF WAYS, IT'S LIFE.

1286
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
THIS IS THE WORLD WE LIVE IN.

1287
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
AND THERE'S EVIL AND HIDING THAT

1288
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
DOES NOT HELP THEM AT ALL.

1289
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
>> SHE MUST HAVE -- I THINK THE

1290
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
ULTIMATE REALITY -- SHE LOOKED

1291
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
AT US AND SAID, WHO AM I GOING

1292
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
TO TALK TO EVERY DAY?

1293
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I SAID THERE ARE OTHER TEACHERS

1294
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
YOU CAN TALK TO.

1295
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
SHE SAID YEAH, BUT SHE WAS

1296
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
REALLY FUNNY.

1297
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
>> WHAT WAS IT ABOUT HER?

1298
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
>> SHE WAS A KIND INDIVIDUAL,

1299
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
YOU CAN TELL SHE HAD A HEART FOR

1300
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
HER CHILDREN, EACH AND EVERY ONE

1301
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
OF THEM.
SHE MEANT BUSINESS, WHICH WE

1302
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
LOVED.

1303
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
>> SHE WAS YOUTHFUL.

1304
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
OUR FIRST TEACHER CONFERENCE I

1305
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
FELT LIKE AN OLD MAN.

1306
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
SHE SEEMED BARELY OUT OF HIGH

1307
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
SCHOOL HERSELF.

1308
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
IT'S JUST A TESTAMENT TO HER

1309
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
PERSONALITY.

1310
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
>> VERY MATURE.

1311
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
SHE WAS A GREAT TEACHER AND SHE

1312
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
PUT EVERYTHING INTO WHAT SHE

1313
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
DID.

1314
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
THE KIDS ENJOYED LEARNING.

1315
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
THERE WASN'T A DAY THAT JORDAN

1316
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
SAID I DON'T WANT TO GO TO

1317
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
SCHOOL.

1318
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
THERE WERE TIMES IT SEEMED LIKE

1319
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
AFTER A WEEKEND SHE WAS EXCITED

1320
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
TO GO BACK.
THAT TOLD US SHE HAD A REALLY

1321
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
GOOD TEACHER.

1322
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
SOMEBODY WHO WAS DOING THEIR JOB

1323
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
AND DOING IT WELL.

1324
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
>> THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US.
I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY, I

1325
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
APPRECIATE IT.

1326
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
>> THANK YOU.

1327
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
>> I WISH YOU PEACE IN THE DAYS

1328
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
