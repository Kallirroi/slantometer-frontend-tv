1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
THINK I MOVE NEARLY AS MUCH AS

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I USED TO, SO I DON'T

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
HAVE THE NEED

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000

THE BODY HELP ITSELF MORE.

12
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
THE PILLOW'S A GREAT

13
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
PLACE TO START.

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000

IN ANY STORE.

23
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
BUT FIRST, LET ME ASK YOU

24
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
A FEW QUESTIONS.

25
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
DO YOU OR SOMEONE YOU CARE

26
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
ABOUT WAKE UP MORE TIRED

27
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
THAN WHEN YOU WENT TO BED?

28
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
DO YOU WAKE UP WITH A HEADACHE,

29
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A STIFF NECK OR THAT TINGLING

30
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
FEELING IN YOUR FINGERS?

31
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
HOW 'BOUT THIS: DO YOU FIND

32
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
YOURSELF TOSSING AND TURNING

33
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
ALL NIGHT, STACKING, FOLDING,

34
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
RE-SMOOSHING YOUR PILLOWS

35
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
OR EVEN FLIPPING IT TO THE COOL

36
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
SIDE JUST TO GET COMFORTABLE?

37
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
IF YOU'VE ANSWERED YES

38
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS,

39
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
THEN YOU, LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHER

MIKE'S HERE TO SHARE WITH US

47
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
WHY GETTING A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
A HAPPY, HEALTHY LIFE.

50
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000

LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE OUT THERE,

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I HAVE USED MY ARMS, FOLDED MY

56
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
PILLOWS, GOT MIGRAINES IN THE

57
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
MORNING FROM SLEEPING ON POOR

58
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
PILLOWS AND WHAT IT IS, WHAT I

59
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
FOUND IN MY STUDIES OVER THE

60
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
LAST SEVEN YEARS IS THE CERVICAL

61
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
NERVES ON EACH SIDE OF YOUR NECK

62
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
NEED TO BE HELD STRAIGHT IN

63
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
ORDER TO GET THAT DEEP REM SLEEP

64
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
THAT WE ALL NEED.

65
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
THAT'S OUR HEALING SLEEP.

66
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
HEALING IS CRITICAL TO ONE'S

67
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
HEALTH AND PILLOWS ARE THE

68
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
PROBLEM.

69
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
THERE IS NO BIGGER PROBLEM THAN

70
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
PILLOWS. >> MIKE, I HEAR WHAT

71
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
YOU'RE SAYING.

72
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL SLEEP

73
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
FOUNDATION, THE AVERAGE ADULT

74
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
PURCHASES 58 PILLOWS OVER THEIR

75
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
LIFETIME, THEY OWN SIX DIFFERENT

76
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
PILLOWS AT ANY GIVEN TIME-- AND

77
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
THIS IS WHAT BLEW ME AWAY--

78
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
70% OF US DO NOT LIKE OUR

79
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
CURRENT PILLOW WE SLEEP

80
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
WITH EVERY NIGHT.

81
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

82
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
>> WELL, I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE

83
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
SOME HERE. [LAUGHS]

84
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THESE, THESE PILLOWS, UH, IN

85
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
THE LAST 30 YEARS, IN THE 1970s,

86
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
PILLOWS KIND OF CHANGED FOREVER

87
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
AND WE'VE ALL SLEPT WITH THIS

88
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
PILLOW HERE.

89
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
THIS PILLOW HERE IS, UH, IT

90
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
PUSHES BACK.

91
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SLEEP ON YOUR

92
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
BACK, YOU FEEL THAT PILLOW.

93
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
>> YEAH, YEAH.

94
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
>> IT'S LIKE SPRING, IT'S LIKE

95
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
PUSHING BACK AT YOU.
>> OH, RIGHT.

96
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
>> YOU'RE ON YOUR BACK AND

97
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
YOU'RE LIKE THIS WITH A TILTED

98
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
NECK, YOU WAKE UP IN THE

99
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
MORNING, YOU'VE BENT YOUR

100
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
PRECEREBRAL ARTERIES AND

101
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
YOU'RE GONNA GET HEADACHES.

102
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
THIS IS NO GOOD.

103
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

104
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
OKAY, THIS PILLOW HERE, IT

105
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
BECOMES A HARD SURFACE.

106
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
WE'VE ALL SLEPT IN THAT, WITH

107
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
THE CURVE.

108
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
THE PROBLEM IS PILLOWS GIVE YOU

109
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
SUPPORT HERE AND HERE, NOTHING

110
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
WHERE YOUR C1 AND C2 IS--

111
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
YOUR AXIS AND YOUR ULNA.

112
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
THOSE ARE CRITICAL TO SNORING,

113
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA, ALL THESE

114
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU NEED

115
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
SUPPORT IN YOUR NECK.

116
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THIS ONE HERE-- AND YOU ALSO

117
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
NEED TO BE KEPT COOL.

118
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
THIS PILLOW HERE WILL HEAT UP,

119
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
WILL ALSO BECOME A HARD SURFACE

120
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
AND IT'S NO GOOD.

121
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
[LAUGHTER]

122
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?

123
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
>> THIS ONE HERE HAS RUINED

124
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
AMERICA.

125
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
WE'VE ALL SLEPT ON THIS.

126
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
THERE'S NO SUPPORT.

127
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
THIS HAS DONE MORE FOR BAD

128
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
SLEEP DEPRIVATION THAN

129
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
ANYTHING ANYWHERE.

130
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
AND ANOTHER THING TOO, WHEN YOU

131
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
WASH THESE PILLOWS, YOU KNOW

132
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
THEY BALL UP IN A WASHER AND

133
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
DRYER... THE BIG PILLOW COMPANY

134
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
WANTS YOU BUYING MORE AND MORE

135
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
PILLOWS AND THEY DON'T CARE

136
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
ABOUT YOUR HEALTH.

137
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT

138
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
OUR SLEEP.

139
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
THEY DON'T CARE THAT WE KEEP

140
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
BUYING PILLOWS OVER

141
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

142
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I JUST WANTED SOME SLEEP AND I

143
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT, AND THIS

144
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
PILLOW HERE, I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH

145
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
BAD THINGS ABOUT, BUT

146
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
IT'S TERRIBLE.

147
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
>> MIKE, I LOVE YOUR PILLOW.

148
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
IT HAS A GREAT WARRANTY.

149
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I LOVE THAT IT'S MADE

150
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
IN AMERICA.

151
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
>> THE BEST THING YOU'RE GONNA

152
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
LIKE ABOUT THIS PILLOW IS I GET

153
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
REM SLEEP, THE DEEP-HEALING

154
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
SLEEP, THE SLEEP THAT HELPS

155
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
ALL YOUR, YOUR HEALTH,

156
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
HOW YOU FEEL THE NEXT DAY.

157
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I HAVE A PATENT ON THIS PILLOW,

158
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
AND WHAT IT IS, IS ALL THREE

159
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
SIZES OF MY FILL ARE IN EVERY

160
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
PILLOW.

161
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THIS STUFF WAS WARRANTIED 10

162
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
YEARS, IT WON'T GO FLAT.
IT'S THE HEALTHIEST

163
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
THING EVER INVENTED.

164
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
IT'S GOT... IT'S NON-ALLERGENIC,

165
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
IT'S ANTI-MICROBIAL, BUT THE

166
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
BEST THING IT DOES... WHEREVER

167
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
YOU SET THIS, OKAY, UNTIL YOU

168
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
FIRST GET COMFORTABLE ON YOUR

169
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
PILLOW AND YOU'RE LIKE THIS AND

170
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
YOU GO LIKE THIS AND...

171
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
NOW, TONJA, I WANT YOU

172
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
TO FEEL THAT.

173
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
YOU SEE HOW THAT HOLDS?

174
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
>> OH, MY GOSH.

175
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
>> THAT WILL NOT MIGRATE.

176
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
WHEREVER YOU SET IT, YOU GET

177
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED FOR YOUR

178
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
INDIVIDUAL NECK SUPPORT, OKAY?

179
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
YOU CAN TRIM THIS ANY WAY

180
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
YOU WANT.

181
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
YOU CAN MAKE LITTLE BALLOON

182
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
ANIMALS OUT OF IT. [LAUGHTER]

183
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
IT'S GONNA HOLD. OKAY,

184
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
IT TAKES SIX POUNDS OF

185
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
PRESSURE TO HOLD THAT

186
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
IN POSITION.

187
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
YOUR PILLOW, YOUR BRAIN SAYS,

372
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
"OKAY, I'M COMFORTABLE," 'CAUSE

373
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
YOUR CERVICAL NERVES ARE

374
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
LINED UP. >> YEAH.

375
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
>> WELL, WHAT HAPPENS IS THE AIR

376
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
STARTS GOING OUT OF THAT PILLOW

377
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
AND THEY'RE BENT, LIKE BENDING A

378
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
WATER HOSE, OKAY?

379
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU GO...

380
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
[MIMICS GUSHING SOUND]

381
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
YOUR SIGNAL'S NOT GOING THROUGH.

382
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
SAME WAY WITH YOUR ARTERIES,

383
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
YOUR PRECEREBRAL ARTERY AND

384
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
YOUR CAROTID ARTERY... THE BLOOD

385
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
FLOW TO THE BRAIN NEEDS TO BE,

386
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
UM, YOU KNOW, OPEN LIKE A HOSE.

387
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
>> IS THAT WHY MY CONCENTRATION

388
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
IS SO MUCH BETTER AFTER I

389
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
SLEEP ON MY PILLOW?

390
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

391
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
>> GOOD SUPPORT, WHICH IS

392
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
SOMEHOW THE MIRACLE OF MY

393
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
PILLOW, UH, THROUGHOUT THE

394
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
NIGHT IS WHAT WE WANT.

395
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
IT'S NICE TO FALL ASLEEP, BUT

396
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
THEN, AS YOUR PILLOW COLLAPSES,

397
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
YOU'RE GONNA WAKE UP AGAIN

398
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
'CAUSE YOUR POSITION'S CHANGED.

399
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
THE MY PILLOW, IT SEEMS THAT

400
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
WE'RE AT A STATE THAT IS

401
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYS THE

402
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
SAME THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.

403
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
>> WHAT DR. KOLODNY HAS TO SAY

404
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
REALLY REINFORCES WHAT YOU'VE

405
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
BEEN TELLING US ABOUT MY PILLOW.

406
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
>> WHAT IT DOES.... THAT IT CAN

407
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
PUT YOU IN A DEEP REM SLEEP,

408
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
WHICH IS THE HEALING SLEEP.

409
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
IT'S ALSO THE MOST COMFORTABLE

410
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
SLEEP.

411
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
WHEN YOU GET COMFORTABLE AT

412
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
NIGHT, THAT'S WHAT SENDS

413
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
YOU INTO THE REM.

414
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
THAT'S WHEN YOUR CERVICAL

415
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
NERVES, YOUR NECK IS LINED UP.

416
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
AND, INTERESTING ENOUGH, WHAT'S

417
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
MY THEORY ON THIS-- THIS THEORY

418
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
WAS BRAND NEW-- AND IT'S

419
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
TRUE, AND IT'S REAL AND

420
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.
NOW, IT'S OUT THERE BECAUSE

421
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
YOU'VE ALL DONE THAT WITH YOUR

422
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
ARMS, FOLDED YOUR PILLOWS AND

423
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
DONE ALL THIS STUFF AND

424
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
FLIP-FLOPPED ALL NIGHT

425
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
LIKE A GUPPY.

426
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
HERE, YOU STAY WITH MY PILLOW.

427
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
WHEREVER YOU SET THIS PILLOW,

428
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
IT'S GONNA HOLD, EXACTLY FOR

429
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL.

430
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
WITH MY PILLOW, BY KEEPING ALL

431
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
THOSE THINGS IN YOUR NECK

432
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
STRAIGHT, YOU GET THE BEST SLEEP

433
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
OF YOUR LIFE EVERY SINGLE

434
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
NIGHT AND I GUARANTEE IT.

435
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
WE MAKE 'EM RIGHT HERE IN THE

436
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
UNITED STATES.
THE REASON WHY I'M STILL IN

437
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
BUSINESS IS TO HELP PEOPLE.

438
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
THAT'S MY CALLING, THAT'S WHY

439
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'M HERE AND I WANT EVERYBODY TO

440
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
HAVE THE BEST NIGHT'S SLEEP

441
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
THEY'VE EVER GOT IN THEIR LIFE.

442
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
>> ABSOLUTELY,

443
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
ABSOLUTELY! [APPLAUSE]

444
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
>> I DISCOVERED THAT HAVING MY

445
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
HEAD, NECK AND SPINE PERFECTLY

446
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
ALIGNED ALL NIGHT, WHETHER IT'S

447
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
ON MY SIDE OR WHETHER,

448
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
OCCASIONALLY, I'M ON MY BACK, I

449
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
CAN GET A PERFECT CERVICAL

450
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
CURVATURE, AND MY ALIGNING THAT

451
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
SPINE, THE FOUR CERVICAL NERVES

452
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
RUNNING RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE

453
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
OF MY NECK GOING EVERYWHERE IN

454
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
MY BODY AND REPORTING BACK UP,

455
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
EVERYTHING IS IN ALIGNMENT.

456
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
IT'S A PHENOMENAL DIFFERENCE IN

457
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
THE WAY THAT YOU'RE ABLE

458
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
TO SLEEP.

459
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
>> I FELL ASLEEP

460
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
INSTANTLY... INSTANTLY.

461
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
>> I HAVE FOUND THAT I HAVE

462
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
MORE ENERGY DURING THE DAY.

463
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I SLEEP BETTER, I'M NOT

464
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
RUSTLING AROUND.

465
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
MY WIFE USED TO TELL ME THAT I

466
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
USED TO FLIP AROUND AND

467
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
MOVE ALL OVER THE BED.

468
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
SHE HAS NOT SAID THAT SINCE

469
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'VE HAD THE MY PILLOW.

470
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
SO IT'S JUST BEEN, IT'S OVERALL

471
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
HAS GIVEN ME A BETTER NIGHT'S

472
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
SLEEP, AND AGAIN, THAT'S WHY

473
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
THE REST OF MY FAMILY HAS

474
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
THE MY PILLOW AS WELL.

475
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
>> WITH THOSE OTHER PILLOWS THAT

476
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
YOU'RE GETTING AT THE MARKETS,

477
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
THEY'RE JUST TRASH, REALLY.

478
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
THEY'RE JUST... THEY'RE CHEAP.

479
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
AND AFTER YOU WASH THEM, THEY

480
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
BUNCH UP, THEY'RE NOT THE

481
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
SAME ANYMORE.

482
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
WITH MY PILLOW, YOU CAN TOSS IT

483
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
INTO THE WASH, YOU CAN AIR DRY

484
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
IT, TOSS IT INTO THE DRYER.

485
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
IT'S SUCH AN EASY PILLOW TO

486
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
TAKE CARE OF AND IT'S GONNA

487
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
LAST YOU FOREVER.

488
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
>> EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT THE

489
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
IMPORTANCE OF A GOOD NIGHT'S

490
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
SLEEP WHICH IS SOMETHING I

491
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
CAN REALLY RELATE TO.

492
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I HAVE TO ADMIT, I WAS PRETTY

493
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
SKEPTICAL, BUT MICHAEL TOLD ME

494
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
IT WOULD REALLY WORK.

495
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
AND AFTER ABOUT TWO OR THREE

496
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
WEEKS, I NOTICED THAT ALL OF MY

497
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
MIGRAINES HAD DISAPPEARED.

498
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
AND WHAT I REALLY NOTICED IS

499
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
THAT I COULD START GOING OUT

500
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
TO THE GYM, I COULD START

501
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
EXERCISING MORE, BECAUSE ANY

502
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
TIME I TRIED TO DO THAT

503
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
BEFORE, I JUST WOULD GET

504
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
EXCRUCIATING HEADACHES.

505
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
AND SO, UH, ONE OF THE THINGS...

506
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
WE TALK ABOUT WASHING AND DRYING

507
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
A PILLOW... I'VE WASHED HUNDREDS

508
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
OF PILLOWS WHERE THEY END UP IN

509
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
THAT CLUMP.

510
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
WELL, I PUT IT IN THE WASHER

511
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
MACHINE AND WHEN I TOOK IT OUT

512
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
OF THE DRYER AND WHEN IT LOOKED

513
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
JUST LIKE IT DID THE DAY I

514
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
BOUGHT IT, I WAS SOLD.

515
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
AND THAT'S WHEN I WANTED TO BUY

516
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
'EM FOR MY KIDS BECAUSE MY KIDS

517
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
ARE ALWAYS TAKING THEIR PILLOW

518
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
IN THE CAR.

519
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
THEY'RE TAKING IT TO GRANDPA AND

520
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
GRANDMA'S HOUSE, THEY'RE

521
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
THROWING IT IN FRONT OF THE TV

522
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
AND SO I'D ALWAYS END UP WASHING

523
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
THEIR PILLOWS AND I KNEW THAT I

524
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
WAS SPENDING MORE MONEY ON GAS

525
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
DRIVING BACK AND FORTH TO THE

526
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
DEPARTMENT STORE TO BUY

527
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
THEM A NEW ONE.

528
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
AND THE OTHER THING THAT I

529
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
REALLY WANTED AND I KNEW IS

530
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
THAT IF THEY REALLY STARTED

531
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
GETTING A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP NOW,

532
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
KEEPING THEIR CERVICAL NERVES IN

533
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
ALIGNMENT AND DOING ALL THAT

534
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
STUFF FOR THEIR HEALTH THAT

535
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
HOPEFULLY, WHEN THEY GOT TO BE

536
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
MY AGE, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THE

537
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
KIND OF PROBLEMS THAT I'VE HAD.

538
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME

539
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
THAT MY KIDS SLEEP ON

540
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
A GREAT PILLOW.

541
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
AND THEY'VE EVEN COMMENTED.

542
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
MY DAUGHTER-- I WAS OUT WORKING

543
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
ONE DAY-- AND SHE SAID... I WAS

544
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
KIND OF TELLING MY PILLOW STORY,

545
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
AND SHE SAID, "MOM, I HAD NO

546
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
IDEA YOU WERE IN THAT

547
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
MUCH PAIN."

548
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
AND SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, AND

549
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I JUST KNOW THAT IT'S MADE ME

550
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
A MUCH BETTER MOM.

551
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
[APPLAUSE]

552
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
>> Announcer: PEOPLE ALL ACROSS

715
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
SO WHEN I GO TO BED, I REALLY,

716
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
REALLY NEED SLEEP AND I'VE TRIED

717
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
PRETTY MUCH EVERY PILLOW OUT

718
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
THERE: THE FLAT PILLOWS, THE

719
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
FIRM, I TRIED A WATER PILLOW AND

720
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
THOSE MEMORY FOAM PILLOWS AND I

721
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
ALWAYS WOKE UP WITH A DULL

722
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
HEADACHE, JUST...

723
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
IT WAS NOT, YOU DON'T HAVE THE

724
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
ENERGY AND YOU CAN'T DEAL

725
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
WITH CHILDREN WHEN

726
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
YOU'RE DEALING WITH THAT.

727
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I SAW MY PILLOW AT ONE OF YOUR

728
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
SHOWS AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,

729
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'D INVESTED ENOUGH MONEY ON

730
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
PILLOWS THAT DIDN'T WORK, SO I

731
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
THOUGHT I'D JUST TRY IT.

732
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
AND THAT NIGHT I HAD THE BEST

733
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
NIGHT'S SLEEP OF MY LIFE IN

734
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
YEARS AND IT'S... IT'S, I'VE

735
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
HAD THE BEST NIGHT'S

736
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
SLEEP EVERY NIGHT.

737
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I DON'T TOSS AND TURN ANYMORE, I

738
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
DON'T WAKE UP WITH A

739
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
DULL HEADACHE.

740
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I JUST REALLY FEEL GOOD

741
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
WHEN I WAKE UP.

742
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I HAVE ENERGY AND I

743
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
LOVE MY PILLOW.

744
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
>> DID YOU BELIEVE IT WHEN YOU

745
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
SAW THE SIGN THAT SAID

746
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
IT DID ALL THAT?

747
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
IT'S TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!

748
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
>> I WAS REALLY SKEPTICAL.

749
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
MY HUSBAND IS THE BIGGEST

750
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
SKEPTIC EVER.

751
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
HE'S LIKE, "YOU WANT TO SPEND

752
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
MONEY ON A PILLOW?

753
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
GO AHEAD, WE'LL SEE WHAT

754
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
HAPPENS," ROLLING HIS EYES.

755
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
AND, HONEST, IT WORKED SO WELL.

756
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I LOVE MY PILLOW, LOVE IT.

757
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
>> Mike: THANK YOU,

758
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
THAT'S AWESOME. THANK YOU.

759
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
>> THANK YOU FOR

760
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
MAKING IT. [APPLAUSE]

761
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
>> I KNOW, MIKE, THAT THE

762
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
60-NIGHT MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE

763
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
REALLY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE

764
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SKEPTICAL,

765
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
WHO KNOW THAT THEY WANT TO TRY A

766
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
PILLOW BUT MAYBE THEY'RE AFRAID

767
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD SO MANY IN

768
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
THE PAST THAT DIDN'T WORK.

769
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
>> RIGHT, AND I'VE SAID, YOU

770
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
KNOW, BACK WHEN I INVENTED THIS

771
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
SEVEN YEARS AGO, OR EIGHT YEARS

772
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
AGO, WHATEVER IT'S BEEN NOW,

773
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
THAT WAS THE ONE THING I WANTED

774
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
PEOPLE TO NOT HAVE, THAT

775
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
SKEPTICISM, SO I GAVE THE... I

776
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
BELIEVED IN IT SO MUCH, THAT'S

777
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
WHY I GAVE THE 60-DAY MONEY-BACK

778
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
GUARANTEE SO THEY'D HAVE NOTHING

779
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
TO LOSE AND EVERYTHING TO GAIN.

780
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING TO GAIN.

781
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
YOUR HEALTH IS THE MOST

782
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
IMPORTANT THING TO

783
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
YOUR LIFE. >> ABSOLUTELY.

784
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
>> AND MY PILLOWS ARE MORE

785
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR HEALTH.

786
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
>> ABSOLUTELY, HANDS DOWN.

787
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
WELL, WE HAVE ANOTHER GENTLEMAN

788
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
IN OUR AUDIENCE

789
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
HIS NAME IS MICHAEL, AND

790
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
MICHAEL,THANK YOU FOR BEING

791
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
HERE TODAY.

792
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
>> WELL, MY PILLOW HELPED A LOT.

793
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
A FEW YEARS BACK I HAD A MEDICAL

794
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
SCARE-- I HAD A JAW JOINT THAT

795
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
WAS GETTING EATEN AWAY BY

796
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
A TUMOR.

797
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
THE GOOD NEWS IS IT WASN'T

798
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
MALIGNANT, IT WAS BENIGN.

799
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT IS WHEN

800
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
THEY ACTUALLY DO THE SURGERY,

801
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO SEVER THE

802
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
MUSCLE THAT NORMALLY FITS OVER

803
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
YOUR JAW JOINTS, SO NOW, AT

804
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
NIGHT, I'VE FOUND THAT MY

805
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
MOUTH WOULD COME OPEN AND

806
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I WOULD START SNORING.

807
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
MY WIFE DID NOT LIKE

808
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
THAT VERY MUCH.

809
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
SO I CAME ACROSS MY PILLOW

810
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
AT A COUNTY FAIR, AND I THOUGHT,

811
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
NO, I'M NOT GONNA BUY A PILLOW.

812
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
AND HE TALKED TO ME, HE SAID,

813
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
"LISTEN, IT'S A MONEY-BACK

814
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
GUARANTEE, TRY IT OUT.

815
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?"

816
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
THOUGHT, OKAY, THAT'S A PRETTY

817
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
GOOD PITCH, LET ME TRY IT.

818
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
THAT NIGHT I SLEPT THROUGH THE

819
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
NIGHT AND IT REALLY WAS ONE OF

820
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
THE FIRST NIGHT'S THAT I CAN

821
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
REMEMBER WHERE I DIDN'T TOSS.

822
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
IT WAS A NICE, COMFORTABLE

823
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
FEELING AND I WOKE UP COOL AND I

824
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
WASN'T GETTING HEADACHES.

825
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
SO THE PRODUCT DOES WORK.

826
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
THANK YOU FOR

827
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
MAKING WHAT YOU MADE.

828
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
>> AND YOU DON'T SNORE
ANYMORE, YOU SAID?

829
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
>> I DON'T SNORE ANYMORE.

830
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
>> [LAUGHS] THAT'S AMAZING.

831
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
THAT'S WHY I LOVE SELLING THIS

832
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000

>> DEFINITELY

837
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
A LIFE-CHANGER.

THIS GUY, HE WROTE ME.

853
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
HE SAID, "I'M WRITING YOU

854
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000

855
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000

RIGHT NOW, I'M SLEEPING ON A COT

860
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
WITH A BAG FULL OF UNUSED

861
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
CLOTHES AS A PILLOW--" WHICH CAN

862
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
BE BETTER THAN SOME OF THE

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000

IF THEY SAID, "I WANT

1035

TO WASH IT AND DRY IT," I MADE

1036
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
MINE FOR WASHER AND DRYER.

1037
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
