00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
THEIR MEMORY.

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
>> "OUTFRONT" NEXT, HONORING THE

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
HEROES OF THE NEWTOWN SCHOOL

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
SHOOTING AND REMEMBERING LOVED

AND WE HAVE THE LATEST ON THE

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
INVESTIGATION, TRYING TO FIND

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
ANSWERS TO THE BIGGEST QUESTION,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
WHY.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
AND A BLOGGER WRITES A PIECE

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
THAT WAS ENTITLED I'M ADAM

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
LANZA'SMOTOR.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
SHE IGNITED A FIRE STORM.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
THAT MOM ANSWERS CRITICS

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
TONIGHT.
LET'S GO "OUTFRONT."

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
>>> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'M ERIN BURNETT, "OUTFRONT"

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
TONIGHT, HONORING THE DEAD.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
THE GRIEVING COMMUNITY OF

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, BEGAN THE

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
BURIALS TODAY.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
JUST A MOMENT AGO, WE WERE

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
APPROACHED BY A REPRESENTATIVE

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
FOR MADELEINE HUH SHOE.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
HER FAMILY WANTED US TO KNOW --

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'M GOING TO QUOTE THE WORDS

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
THEY SAID WITH ALL OF YOU,

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
SWEET, UNIQUE, BRIGHT,

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
SPARKLING, DETERMINED LITTLE

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
GIRL.
SHE WAS AN AVID READER WHO LOVED

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
RUNNING AND DANCING.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
SHE WAS A BORN LEADER.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
THIS IS THE START OF WHAT WILL

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
BE A PAINFUL WEEK AS FRIENDS AND

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
FAMILY TRY TO PREPARE TO TRY TO

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
SAY GOOD-BYE TO THE 20 CHILDREN

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
AND SIX EDUCATORS WHO WERE

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
KILLED ON FRIDAY IN THE SECOND

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
WORST SCHOOL SHOOTING IN

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
AMERICAN HISTORY.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
AS NEWTOWN MOURNS, INVESTIGATORS

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
WHAT MOTIVATED ADAM LANZA TO GO

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
ON A SHOOTING SPREE, TO KILL

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
CHILDREN, AND ALSO TAKE THE LIFE

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
OF HIS OWN MOTHER.

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE ON THE

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
INVESTIGATION IN A MOMENT.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
BUT THE TRUTH IS, WE MAY NEVER

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
KNOW WHY ADAM LANZA CHOSE TO GO

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
ON A MASS KILLING SPREE.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
WE MAY NEVER KNOW WHY HE CHOSE

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
TO GO IN A SCHOOL AND KILL

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
INNOCENT 6 AND 7-YEAR-OLDS, BUT

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
WE'RE LEARN AGLOT MORE TONIGHT

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
ABOUT HIS MOTHER NANCY AND THE

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
RELATIONSHIP SHE HAD WITH HER

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
TROUBLED SON.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
ACCORDING TO FRIENDS, THE

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
52-YEAR-OLD DIVORCED MOTHER OF

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
TWO WAS DEVOTED TO HER CHILDREN

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
AND WAS ESPECIALLY CLOSE WITH

64
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
ADAM WHO FRIENDS SAY WAS VERY

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
INTELLIGENT BUT SOCIALLY

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
AWKWARD.
A RETIRED STOCK BROKER FROM NEW

67
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
HAMPSHIRE, SHE WAS A LIFELONG

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
RED SOX FAN WITH SEASON TICKETS

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
WHO LIVED WITH HER SON ADAM IN A

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
LARGE COLONIAL HOME NOT FAR FROM

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
THE CENTER OF HOME.

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
FRIENDS SAY SHE WAS A

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
CONTRADICTION.
EXTREMELY GENEROUS AND FRIENDLY,

74
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
BUT EXTREMELY PRIVATE WHEN IT

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
CAME TO HER FAMILY LIFE.

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
THEY SAID SHE DID TALK ABOUT THE

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
CHALLENGES OF RAISING A SON WITH

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
ASPERGER'S SYNDROME, AND DURING

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
AN INTERVIEW WITH CNN, NANCY'S

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
FRIENDS SAID SHE MIGHT SOON BE

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
MOVING THERE.

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
>> SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
WASHINGTON STATE, AND SHE WAS

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
READY TO CHANGE HER WHOLE LIFE,

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
SELL HER HOUSE AND START OVER

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
JUST FOR HIM, JUST SO HE COULD

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
GO TO SCHOOL AND -- I MEAN, HE

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
WAS -- HE WAS HER LIFE.

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
>> FRIENDS SAY NANCY LANZA WAS A

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
GUN ENTHUSIAST AND HAD TAKEN UP

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
TARGET SHOOTING AS A HOBBY WHEN

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
SHE INTRODUCED TO HER SON ADAM,

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
BUT THEY INSIST SHE WAS ALWAYS

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
RESPONSIBLE WITH GUNS.

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
>> THEY PAINTED HER AS SOME

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
IRRESPONSIBLE GUN FREAK, BUT SHE

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
WASN'T.
SHE WAS -- SHE WAS THE EPITOME

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
OF RESPONSIBILITY.

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
SHE WAS A PARAGON FOR GUN

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
SAFETY.
SHE TAUGHT THE BOYS HOW TO USE

101
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THE GUNS RESPONSIBLY.

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
>> LITTLE DID SHE KNOW THAT THE

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
SON SHE DOTED ON AND TAUGHT HOW

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
TO USE GUNS WOULD TURN THOSE

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
GUNS ON HER AND CHILDREN.

106
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THAT ADAM

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
LANZA SHOT AND KILLED HER MOTHER

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
AS SHE WAS LYING IN BED BEFORE

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
TAKING HER GUNS, TWO OF HER

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
HANDGUNS AND AN ASSAULT RIFLE,

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
TO SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I SAT DOWN WITH SOME OF NANCY'S

113
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
FRIENDS AT ONE OF HER FAVORITE

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
PLACES IN NEWTOWN, A PLACE SHE

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
WENT TO TWO TO THREE TIMES A

116
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
WEEK, AND I ASKED THEM ABOUT WHO

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
WAS NANCY LANLZA.

118
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
>> ABOUT 12 YEARS AGO, 12, 13

119
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
YEARS AGO.

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
YEAH, MET HER IN THE BAR.

121
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
SHE COME IN HERE AND HAD

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
TAKE-OUT FOOD.
WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
WITH MARK, YOU KNOW, WE USED TO

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
TALK IN THE BAR.
YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE CLICKED.

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
THAT WAS IT.
YOU KNOW, WE STARTED TALKING.

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
WE BECAME GOOD FRIENDS.

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
>> GOT TO KNOW HER?

128
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
>> YEAH.

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
YEAH, LIKE I SAID, SHE STARTED

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
COMING TO THE TAKE-OUT AREA,

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
PICKING UP FOOD.

132
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
SHE GOT TO KNOW OUR FAMILY

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
PRETTY WELL.

134
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
AND SHE WAS VERY FRIENDLY,

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
OUTGOING.
SHE WAS FUNNY.
WE TOOK TO HER.

136
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
YEAH, SHE BECAME FAST FRIENDS

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
WITH US.

138
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
YOU KNOW.

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
SHE DID A LOT IN TOWN.

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
WAS ALWAYS ON THE GO.

141
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
>> HOW OFTEN DID SHE COME IN

142
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
HERE?
SOUNDS LIKE YOU KNOW HER WELL.

143
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
WAS THIS KIND OF HER REGULAR

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
PLACE?
>> YEAH.

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
TWO TO THREE TIMES A WEEK.

146
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
>> TWO TO THREE TIMES A WEEK?

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
>> FOR FOOD, ESPECIALLY.

148
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
THE BAR, NOT SO OFTEN.

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
YOU KNOW.

150
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
>> WHEN SHE HAD TICKETS FOR US

151
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
TO THE BALL GAMES.

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
WE USED TO GO TO THE BOSTON

153
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
GAMES.
>> SHE HAD TICKETS TO THE RED

154
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
SOX, SO SHE WOULD INVITE US OR

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
GIVE US THE TICKETS.

156
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
>> WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME SHE

157
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
CAME IN?

158
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
>> I SAW HER LAST WEEK OR TWO

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
WEEKS AGO TOPS.

160
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
SHE CAME IN AND I WAS TALKING TO

161
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
HER FOR A LITTLE BIT.

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
AS FAR AS THIS, SHE CAME TO PICK

163
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
UP FOOD MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE

164
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
DURING THE WEEK.
>> YOU DIDN'T MEET THE BOYS,

165
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
RIGHT?
>> RIGHT.

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
>> YOU KNEW ONE OF THEM?

167
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
>> BOTH OF THEM.

168
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
RYAN WORKED FOR ME FOR A YEAR

169
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
AND A HALF WHEN HE WAS IN HIGH

170
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
SCHOOL.
HE WAS A BUSKER.

171
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
ADAM WAS NEVER A SOCIAL PERSON.

172
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
HE USED TO COME IN AND KEEP HIS

173
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
HEAD DOWN.

174
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
HE WAS NEVER SURE OF HIMSELF.

175
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
>> YOU KNEW THERE WAS

176
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
SOMETHING --

177
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
>> SHE HAD TOLD US THAT, YOU

178
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000

179
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
YOU KNOW, ALWAYS HAD AN ISSUE IN

181
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
SCHOOL SOCIALLY WITH THAT.

182
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
HE WAS A HIGHLY INTELLIGENT KID,

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
VERY HIGH IQ.

184
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
GRADUATED AROUND TENTH GRADE OR

185
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
SO.
>> SO GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL

186
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
EARLY?
>> YEAH, I THINK SO.

187
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
LIKE TENTH GRADE.

188
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
YEAH, VERY, VERY INTELLIGENT

189
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
KID.

190
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
AND I MENTIONED EARLIER, TOO, A

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE MENTIONING

192
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
ASPERGER'S.
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY

193
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.
I THINK THAT A LOT OF KIDS HAVE

194
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
IT, AND I DON'T THINK IT HAS

195
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE

196
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
SITUATION AT ALL BECAUSE KIDS

197
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
WITH THAT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

198
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG.

199
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
>> SHE TALKED -- NANCY TALKED

200
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
OVER THE YEARS ABOUT HER SONS?

201
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
>> WHEN SHE CAME IN HERE, WE

202
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
SOCIALIZED AND WENT OUT.

203
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT THE

204
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
FAMILY.
IT WAS HER -- SHE JUST CAME IN

205
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
TO HAVE A GREAT TIME, TO TALK.

206
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
>> GET IT OFF HER MIND, IF

207
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
ANYTHING.
SHE DID, BUT SHE WOULD ONLY SAY

208
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
HE WAS -- YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN

209
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
HARD FOR HER, YOU KNOW.

210
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR HER,

211
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
BRINGING HIM UP.

212
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
AND SHE WAS ALWAYS --

213
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
>> TALKED ABOUT IT.

214
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
>> SHE WAS ALWAYS ON IT.

215
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
YEAH, JUST SAYING, YEAH, NEVER

216
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
REALLY -- DIDN'T HAVE TO COME IN

217
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
AND TALK ABOUT IT.

218
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT

219
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
IT.

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
SHE WOULD MENTION IT'S BEEN

221
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
DIFFICULT.

222
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
YOU KNOW, I DID SO MUCH FOR HIM

223
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
TO TRY TO GET HIM HELP HERE OR

224
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
THERE OR DOING DIFFERENT THINGS.

225
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD A

226
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
LOT ABOUT HER IS SHE WAS

227
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
PASSIONATE ABOUT GUNS.

228
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
SHE COLLECTED GUNS.

229
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU KNEW

230
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
ABOUT OR WERE SURPRISED WHEN YOU

231
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
HEAR?
>> I WOULD SAY IN THE LAST THREE

232
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
YEARS OR SO, SHE PICKED UP THAT

233
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
HOBBY.
I DON'T KNOW WHO GOT HER INTO

234
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
IT, BUT SHE REALLY ENJOYED IT.

235
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
TARGET SHOOTING.

236
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
SO I DIDN'T KNOW.

237
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I HAD NO IDEA -- YEAH.

238
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
>> NOT COLLECTING GUNS?

239
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
>> SHE WAS A TARGET SHOOTER.

240
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
SHE PROBABLY HAD SOME GUNS SHE

241
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
USED TO TAKE TO THE RANGE AND

242
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
PRACTICE WITH.

243
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
WHERE DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE OWNED

244
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
OR WHAT SHE SAID.

245
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
SHE SAID SHE ENJOYED IT, AND

246
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
THAT WAS IT.
WE DON'T KNOW IF SHE

247
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
SONS, DIDN'T TAKE HER SONS.

248
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
SHE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT MUCH.

249
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I TOOK IT UP, IT WAS FUN, THAT

250
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
KIND OF THING.

251
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
>> GIVEN YOU KNEW HER AS A

252
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
PERSON, DO YOU THINK SHE WAS A

253
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
PERSON WHO WOULD HAVE THE GUNS

254
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
AROUND THE HOUSE?

255
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN LOCKED UP?

256
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
>> THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN LOCKED

257
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
UP.
>> FAR TOO BRIGHT FOR THAT.

258
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
VERY SMART.

259
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
SHE WAS REALLY FUN.

260
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
SHE UNDERSTOOD.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK SOME OF THE

261
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
BIGGEST MISCONCEPTIONS ARE THAT

262
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
YOU HAVE HEARD ON THE NEWS?

263
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
>> I THINK MOSTLY THE, YOU KNOW,

264
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
WELL, BETWEEN THE CONDITION THAT

265
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
HE HAD, WHICH PEOPLE GET

266
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
CONFUSED FOR BEING THE REASON,

267
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
AND THE GUNS.

268
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T THINK THAT

269
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER

270
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
CHARACTER.

271
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
>> SHE DONATED HER TIME FOR ALL

272
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
CHARITABLE WORK, HELPING PEOPLE

273
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
WHO NEEDED HELP.

274
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
HELPING AIDS PEOPLE, DONATING

275
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
MONEY FOR AIDS AND CHARITY.

276
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
THAT'S WHAT SHE DID.

277
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
SHE DIDN'T -- SHE DIDN'T GET

278
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
PAID FOR DOING WHAT SHE DID.

279
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
SHE DID ALL CHARITABLE WORK ON

280
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
HER OWN.

281
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
>> VERY GENEROUS?

282
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
>> VERY GENEROUS.

283
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
VERY GENEROUS.
A PERSON COULD BE SITTING HERE

284
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
AND SAY, YOU'RE TALKING TO HER,

285
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
AND THEY HAPPEN TO BE SAYING,

286
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
YOU KNOW, I DON'T SHAVE MONEY FR

287
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
THIS OR HAVE MONEY FOR THAT.

288
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
SHE WOULD DIG OUT HER CHECKBOOK

289
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
AND WRITE A CHECK AND GIVE IT TO

290
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
THE PERSON WITHOUT KNOWING THEM.

291
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
THAT'S THE KIND OF PERSON SHE

292
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
WAS.

293
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
>> ALL RIGHT, I WANT TO BRING IN

294
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI.

295
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
SHE HAS THE LATEST ON THE

296
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
INVESTIGATION.

297
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I KNOW WE WERE HEARING THE

298
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
FRIENDS OF NANCY LANZA TALKING

299
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
ABOUT HOW SHE PICKED UP THE GUN

300
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
HOBBY OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS.

301
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
THEY WERE VERY ADAMANT SHE

302
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE KIND OF

303
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
PERSON TO HAVE LET HER GUNS

304
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
LOOSE.

305
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
SHE WOULD HAVE LOCKED THEM UP.

306
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING ABOUT

307
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
TARGET SHOOTING, NANCY LANZA,

308
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
AND ADAM?

309
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

310
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
INVESTIGATORS HAVE TO LOOK AT.

311
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
WHAT WERE BOTH OF THEM DOING IN

312
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THIS?

313
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
IN PARTICULAR, HER SON, THE

314
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
SUSPECTED SHOOTER IN THE CASE?

315
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
THEY'RE FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT

316
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
THAT.
THEY'RE LEARNING IN FACT BOTH

317
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
MOTHER AND SON HAD BEEN TO

318
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
TARGET PRACTICE, DID GO TO GUN

319
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
RANGES SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE

320
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

321
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW

322
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
OFTEN YET, BUT MOST RECENTLY FOR

323
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
ADAM, ANYWAY, IN THE LAST SIX

324
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
YEARS AND OVER THE COURSE OF

325
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
SEVERAL YEARS.

326
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
THE REASON THEY DON'T KNOW THE

327
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
BIG PICTURE, THE FULL PICTURE IS

328
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
ATF IS STILL CANVASSING ALL OF

329
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
THE GUN RANGES IN THE AREA, AND

330
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
THERE ARE A TON OF THEM, TO GET

331
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS.

332
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
THEY'RE STILL FOLLOWING A LOT OF

333
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
LEADS, AND THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING

334
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
AT COMPUTERS, COMPUTER SAID THEY

335
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
HAVE DISCOVERED IN THE HOME.

336
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
A COUPLE OF THEM, WE LEARNED

337
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
FROM OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

338
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
OFFICIALS, IS THAT THEY WERE

339
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
SMASHED.

340
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
SMASHED TO SMITH ARENES.

341
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
>> HE TRIED TO DESTROY THE

342
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
EVIDENCE?

343
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
>> THAT APPEARS TO BE THE CASE,

344
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THE APPARENT INDICATION.

345
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
THEY HAVE HAD TO PICK UP THE

346
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
PIECES, LITERALLY, PULL THINGS

347
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
TOGETHER, TRY TO EXAMINE THE

348
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
HARD DRIVE.
WHAT WOULD THEY BE LOOKING FOR?

349
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
OBVIOUSLY, CHECKING TO SEE IF HE

350
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
SENT E-MAILS TO ANYONE, WHAT

351
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
WEBSITES DID HE VISIT?

352
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
WAS HE IN CHAT ROOMS, MESSAGE

353
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
BOARDS?
GIVE ANY INDICATION TO A

354
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
POSSIBLE MOTIVE IN ALL THIS?

355
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
WHO DID HE COMMUNICATE WITH, IF

356
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
ANYONE?

357
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

358
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
THEY'RE LOOKING AT.

359
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
AND REMEMBER, THEY ARE ALSO

360
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
DOING A COMPLETE HISTORY OF ALL

361
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
OF THE WEAPONS THAT WERE USED IN

362
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
THIS TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

363
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
WE'VE GOT THE ONE MADE BY

364
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
BUSHMASTER, WHICH WAS THAT

365
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
ASSAULT-TYPE RIFLE, AND WE KNOW

366
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
HE CAME, ACCORDING TO OFFICIALS,

367
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
WITH A TON OF AMMUNITION.

368
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
HE WAS ARMED TO THE HILT WHEN HE

369
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000

FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN,

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
AND MADE A MONTHLY TRIP TO THE
CLINIC TO GET HIS BLOOD TESTED.

442
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

A DIFFERENT OPTION:

444
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
ONCE-A-DAY XARELTO®.

445
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000

THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE
ROUTINE BLOOD MONITORING.

450
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
LIKE WARFARIN,
XARELTO® IS PROVEN EFFECTIVE

451
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
TO REDUCE THE RISK
OF AN AFIB-RELATED STROKE.

452

ON HOW THESE DRUGS COMPARE

XARELTO® RIVAROXABAN

WITHOUT TALKING TO THE DOCTOR
WHO PRESCRIBES IT FOR YOU.

ABNORMAL BLEEDING.

XARELTO® CAN CAUSE BLEEDING,
WHICH CAN BE SERIOUS,

AND RARELY MAY LEAD TO DEATH.

MORE EASILY ON XARELTO®,

BELIEVE IT.

547
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I STOPPED AND SAID TO MYSELF,

548
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
THIS ISN'T NORMAL.

549
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I HAVE TO FACE UP TO THE FACT

550
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
THAT I HAVE A SICK SON, AND WE

551
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
NEED HELP.

552
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
AND ERIN, THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE

553
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
BLOG POST WAS ABOUT.

554
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
IT WAS ABOUT -- IT WAS A CRY FOR

555
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
HELP.

556
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
IN A SITUATION WHERE I WAS

557
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
FEELING VERY HELPLESS.

558
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
>> AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE HAS?

559
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
WHAT CAUSES HIM TO DO THIS?

560
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
HAS IT EVER BEEN DIAGNOSED?

561
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
>> WE HAVE HAD A VARIETY OF

562
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
DIAGNOSES.

563
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
WE HAVE LOOKED AT OPPOSITIONAL

564
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
SOCIETAL DISORDER, INTERMITTENT

565
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
DISORDERS.

566
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
HE'S BEEN LOOKED AT FOR AUTISM

567
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
SPECTRISM DISORDER AND FINALLY

568
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
ALSO ADHD.

569
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
>> SO YOU'RE NOT EVEN SURE.

570
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I KNOW TO GIVE THE VIEWERS SOME

571
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
BACKGROUND HERE, YOU AND YOUR

572
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
HUSBAND, HE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN

573
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
INTO JUVENILE DETENTION FOUR

574
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
TIMES AND HE'S NOW AT WHAT YOU

575
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
CALL AN ACUTE IN-PATIENT

576
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
FACILITY, A MENTAL HEALTH

577
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
FACILITY, AND YOU TOOK HIM THERE

578
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
AFTER THE NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT.

579
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
WHEN YOU WRITE ABOUT THE MOMENT,

580
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'LL READ IT, MICHAEL WAS IN A

581
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
FULL-BLOWN FIT, SCREAMING AND

582
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
HITTING.
I HUGGED HIM CLOSE SO HE

583
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
COULDN'T ESCAPE FROM THE CAR.

584
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
HE BIT ME SEVERAL TIMES AND

585
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
REPEATEDLY JABBED HIS ELBOWS IN

586
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
MY RIB CAGE.

587
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'M STILL STRONGER THAN HE IS,

588
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
BUT I WON'T BE FOR MUCH LONGER.

589
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
HOW LONG WILL HE BE IN THE

590
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTION AND

591
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN HE COMES

592
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
HOME?
>> ERIN, THAT'S THE REASON I

593
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
WROTE THE BLOG.

594
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
PEOPLE HAVE HAD A HARD TIME

595
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
UNDERSTANDING THIS, BUT WHERE WE

596
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
LIVE, I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS

597
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
WHERE YOU LIVE, BUT WHERE WE

598
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
LIVE, MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT IS

599
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
PRETTY SHORT-TERM, SO THIS

600
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
FACILITY FOR YOUNG ADULTS, 10 TO

601
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
14 DAYS MAYBE AT THE MOST.

602
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
MAYBE EVEN LESS.

603
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
AND AFTER THAT, THERE JUST

604
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
REALLY AREN'T A LOT OF OPTIONS

605
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
FOR CONTINUED RESIDENTIAL

606
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
TREATMENT HERE.

607
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
THAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE I'M

608
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
FACING, THE ADVICE I GOT WAS

609
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
THAT I NEEDED TO PRESS CHARGES

610
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
SO THAT WE COULD CREATE A PAPER

611
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
TRAIL AGAIN.
AND HE DID GET EXCELLENT

612
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
FOLLOW-THROUGH CARE WHEN HE HAD

613
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
TO DO JUVENILE DETENTION AS A

614
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
YOUNGER BOY.

615
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
BUT I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE JAIL

616
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
IS THE RIGHT PLACE FOR MY SON.

617
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
AND I'M JUST REALLY HOPING THAT

618
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
WE CAN FIND ANOTHER SOLUTION FOR

619
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
HIM.
>> YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED, OF

620
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
COURSE, FOR WRITING THIS BLOG.

621
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I KNOW YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF

622
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
THAT.
YOU WROTE IT UNDER YOUR OWN NAME

623
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
SO PEOPLE COULD FIGURE OUT WHO

624
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
YOUR SON IS.
MICHAEL ISN'T HIS REAL NAME, BUT

625
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
ANYONE WHO KNEW YOU COULD FIGURE

626
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
IT OUT.
YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR

627
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
DOING THAT, MAYBE IF HE DOES

628
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
GROW UP AND IS ABLE TO BECOME A

629
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
FUNCTIONING MEMBER OF SOCIETY,

630
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
THIS WOULD DOG HIM FOR THE REST

631
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
OF HIS LIFE.

632
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
YOUR WORDS WOULD BE THERE.

633
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?

634
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
>> THOSE KINDS OF CRITICISMS ARE

635
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
GOING TO COME UP ANY TIME

636
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
THERE'S A SITUATION LIKE THIS.

637
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
FIRST AND FOREMOST, AND I

638
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
REALIZE THIS SOUNDS HOPELESSLY

639
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
NAIVE, I DID BELIEVE MY BLOG WAS

640
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
ANONYMO

641
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
ANONYMOUS.
IF YOU LOOK AT IT, MY NAME

642
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
WASN'T IN THERE.

643
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
MY LINK WAS IN THE BLUE REVIEW

644
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
AND THAT WAS LINKED TO MY BLOG.

645
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, AS YOU

646
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
PROBABLY KNOW, THERE'S A GREAT

647
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
WOMAN NAMED SARAH OUT THERE WHO

648
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
HAS A WONDERFUL BLOG, SHAEZ E'SY

649
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
ARTICULATE AND PASSIONATE AND

650
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
CONCERNED ABOUT CHILDREN'S

651
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
PRIVACY ISSUES.

652
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I THINK HER CONCERNS ARE

653
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
LEGITIMATE.

654
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
HER CONCERNS ABOUT CHILDREN'S

655
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
PRIVACY ISSUES ARE LEGITIMATE.

656
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
HIGH SON DOES KNOW ABOUT THE

657
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
PIECE.

658
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
HIS TAKE ON IT WAS, MOM, IF WE

659
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
CAN HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND, THIS

660
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
IS A GOOD THING.

661
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
>> LIZA, LET ME ASK YOU BECAUSE

662
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
YOU MENTIONED SARAH.

663
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
AND THAT'S WHO YOU'RE REFERRING

664
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
TO.
SHE'S ANOTHER MOM WHO WAS

665
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
INCREDIBLY CRITICAL OF YOU.

666
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
YOU HAVE TALKED AND YOU PUT OUT

667
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
A JOINT STATEMENT SAYING LOOK,

668
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
AMERICA, LET'S HAVE A

669
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
CONVERSATION ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH

670
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
ISSUES.
WHEN SHE POSTED ONLINE, YOU

671
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
WROTE THINGS ABOUT YOUR SON'S

672
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
BEHAVIOR.
I'LL QUOTE YOU AGAIN, IT MAKES

673
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
ME WANT TO THROTTLE YOU, I QUIT,

674
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
LET THE STATE TAKE CARE OF YOU.

675
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
YOU WROTE, MY DAYDREAMS ALL

676
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
INVOLVED MY OWN DEATH?

677
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
ARE THOSE EMOTIONS YOU FEEL AS A

678
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
MOTHER AND PEOPLE DON'T SAY,

679
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
WERE YOU EXAGGERATING?

680
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
TELL ME HOW THAT HAPPENED?

681
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE TO ADMIT

682
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
THAT YOU GUYS HAVE SCRUTINIZED

683
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
MY BLOG A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN I

684
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SCRUTINIZED.

685
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN AMERICA

686
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
THINKS ANYONE READS THEIR BLOGS.

687
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
YEAH, I THINK ONE OF THE HA

688
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
HALLMARKS OF MY WRITING AND ONE

689
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
OF THE REASONS THE LAST PIECE

690
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
CONNECTED WITH SO MANY PEOPLE IS

691
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
THAT I DO HAVE A TENDENCY TO

692
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
KIND OF SAY WHAT'S ON MY MIND.

693
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
YOU KNOW, I WROTE THOSE WORDS,

694
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
AND THOSE ARE MY WORDS.

695
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'M NOT DISOWNING THEM, BUT

696
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A FOUR-YEAR --

697
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
THAT'S A FOUR-YEAR SLICE OF

698
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
HISTORY.

699
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
>> LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

700
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
DO YOU OWN A GUN?

701
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
>> HEAVENS NO.

702
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
NO, NO, NO.

703
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
NO.
>> OKAY.

704
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE

705
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
WRITING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH.

706
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID, LOOK, YOU

707
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
HAVE FAIR POINTS, LIZA, BUT

708
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
DON'T LET THIS OBSCURE THE

709
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
NATIONAL DEBATE WE NEED TO HAVE

710
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL AND WHAT WE

711
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
NEED TO DO.

712
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
>> OH, MY GOODNESS, NO.

713
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I HEARD THAT FROM MORE THAN ONE

714
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
PERSON.

715
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I THINK THE QUESTION IS IT'S

716
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
SOMETHING ABOUT IT'S EASY TO

717
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
TALK ABOUT GUN CONTROL BUT IT'S

718
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
TIME TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL

719
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
HEALTH.
IF I CAN CLARIFY, WHAT I MEAN IS

720
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
EASY IS WE CAN FRAME THE GUN

721
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
CONTROL DEBATE IN TERMS OF RIGHT

722
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
AND WRONG.
YOU KNOW, IT'S RIGHT TO HAVE GUN

723
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
CONTROL.
OR IT'S WRONG, AS SOME PEOPLE

724
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
WOULD SAY, TO HAVE GUN CONTROL.

725
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
THAT'S A SIMPLE WAY TO DEBATE A

726
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
QUESTION.
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SAY THAT

727
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
MENTAL HEALTH IS RIGHT OR WRONG.

728
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
>> YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

729
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LIZA.

730
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME

731
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
AND COMING AND TALKING ABOUT

732
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
THIS.
>> THANK YOU, ERIN.

733
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU

734
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
HIGHLIGHTING THIS IMPORTANT

735
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH.

736
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I REALLY FEEL LIKE THIS IS A

737
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
CONVERSATION WE NEED TO HAVE AS

738
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
A NATION.
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING FOR OUR

739
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
CHILDREN AND ADULTS WHO STRUGGLE

740
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
WITH BEHAVIORAL AND MENTAL

741
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
HEALTH ISSUES.

742
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
>> WE CERTAINLY DO.
THANKS.
>> THANK YOU.

743
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
>>> NOW, I ASKED LIZA WHY SHE

744
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
HAD PUT A PICTURE UP OF HER SON

745
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
ON HER BLOG SINCE SHE CHANGED

746
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
HIS NAME AND WANTED TO PROTECT

747
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
HIS PRIVACY.
SHE WAS OPEN.

748
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
SHE SAID THE PICTURE OF HIM WAS

749
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
AT AGE 7.

750
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
HE LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THAT NOW.

751
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
HE'S 13 YEARS OLD.

752
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I WANT TO BRING IN DR. SANJAY

753
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
GUPTA.

754
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
HOST OF SANJAY GUPTA M.D.

755
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
WHEN YOU HEAR LIZA TALK ABOUT

756
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
HER CHILD AND HIS STRUGGLES,

757
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
SHE'S TAKEN A LOT OF CRITICISM.

758
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> IT WAS A GOOD INTERVIEW.

759
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
YOU GOT THE SENSE IT WAS A

760
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
LITTLE THERAPEUTIC FOR HER, HER

761
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
WRITING.

762
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
SHE WRITES THIS STUFF.

763
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
SEEING HER, MIEETING HER THROUG

764
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
THE INTERVIEW, YOU CAN TELL

765
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
SHE'S NOT THE KIND OF MOM WHO IS

766
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
GOING TO DO THOSE THINGS.

767
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
SHE'S FRUSTRATED.

768
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
IMAGINE THE THRESHOLD TO GET

769
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
YOUR CHILD TREATMENT IS THEY

770
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
HAVE TO BE IMMINENT HARM TO

771
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
THEMSELVES OR OTHER PEOPLE.

772
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
THAT'S LIKE SAYING YOU CAN ONLY

773
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
GO TO THE HOSPITAL IF YOU'RE

774
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
ALREADY HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

775
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

776
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT PUTTING MENTAL HEALTH ON

777
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
PAR WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH.

778
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
IT'S NOT RIGHT NOW.

779
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
>> IT WAS HARD WHEN YOU HAVE TO

780
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
GUARD YOUR CHIARGE YOUR CHILD

781
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
WITH BATTERY OR ASSAULT TO GET

782
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
THEM CARE.

783
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
YOU HAVE DONE THE NUMBERS, 1 IN

784
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
5 CHILDREN HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH

785
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
ISSUE IN THIS COUNTRY.

786
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
THAT'S AN AMAZING NUMBER.

787
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
>> THAT IS AN AMAZING NUMBER,

788
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
AND THE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES

789
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
AREN'T THERE.
WHEN YOU PRESCRIBE A MEDICATION

790
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
OR TAKE SOMEONE OFF A

791
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
MEDICATION, ALL THE LITERATURE

792
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
SAYS YOU HAVE TO MONITOR A

793
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
PERSON.
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO, THEY

794
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
GET PRESCRIPTIONS AND THEY DON'T
GET THE FOLLOW-UP.

795
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM.

796
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
IT'S SOMETHING THAT COMES UP IN

797
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
A TRAGEDY HERE.

798
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
>> IT SEEMS THAT A LOT OF

799
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
PARENTS WOULD BE UNDERSTANDABLY

800
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
IN DENIAL.

801
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
MY CHILD DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM,

802
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
OR THEY'RE GOING TO GROW OUT OF

803
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
IT.
NOBODY WANTS TO BE THAT -- BE IN

804
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
THAT POSITION.
>> I THINK DENIAL IS A BIG PART

805
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
OF THIS.

806
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
YOU KNOW, ERIN, I HAVE BEEN

807
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
TALKING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.

808
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
WHAT I'M HEARING MORE THAN

809
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
ANYTHING ELSE IS ANGUISH OVER

810
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THEIR

811
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
CHILDREN.
THEY WOULD LOVE TO GET TREATMENT

812
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
FOR THEIR CHILDREN, BUT IT MEANS

813
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
GIVING THEM A CRIMINAL RECORD OR

814
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
SAYING THEY ARE GOING TO HURT

815
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
PEOPLE.
THAT'S A TOUGH CHOICE TO MAKE.

816
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
>> YOU CAN SEE THE ANGUISH.

817
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

818
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

819
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
>>> UP NEXT, WE'LL BRING YOU

820
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
SOME OF OUR OTHER TOP STORIES

821
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
FROM THE DAY.

822
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
WE HAVE MORE FROM NEWTOWN,

OF A MAN WHO FOUND CHILDREN ON

825
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
HIS FRONT LAWN, VICTIMS OF A

826
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
HORRIBLE CRIME THE WORLD AT THAT

827
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
MOMENT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT.

828
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
YOU CAN STAY IN
AND LIKE SOMETHING...

829
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
OR YOU CAN GET OUT THERE
AND ACTUALLY LIKE SOMETHING.

830
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
THE LEXUS DECEMBER TO REMEMBER
SALES EVENT IS ON.

831
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
THIS IS THE PURSUIT
OF PERFECTION.

832
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
>>> WELCOME BACK.

833
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
TONIGHT, WE START THE SECOND

834
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
OLDER MEMBER DIED TODAY.

839
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
HE REPRESENTED HAWAII AND WAS

840
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
THE SECOND LONGEST SERVING

841
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
MEMBER IN THE HISTORY.

842
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
A WORLD WAR II VETERAN.

843
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
HE WAS HOSPITALIZED LAST WEEK

844
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
BUT EVENTUALLY SUCCUMBED TO

845
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
RESPIRATORY COMPLICATIONS.

846
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
WE'RE TOLD HIS LAST WORD WAS

847
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
ALOHA.

848
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
>> FISCAL CLIFF TALKS MAY BE

849
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
GAINING SOME MOMENTUM.

850
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA MET WITH HOUSE

851
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER AFTER

852
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
BOEHNER INDICATED HE WAS WILLING

853
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
TO MAKE NEW CONCESSIONS.

854
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
IT WAS A FACE-TO-FACE MEETING,

855
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
THEIR THIRD IN EIGHT DAYS.

856
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
A DPEEAL COULD HELP THE COUNTRY

857
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
GET OUR AAA RATING BACK.

858
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
ELSEWHERE IN POLITICS, A BIG

859
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
DECISION IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

860
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY HAS

861
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
REPRESENTED KIM SCOTT TO REPLACE

862
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
OUTGOING SENATOR JIM DeMINT.

863
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
SCOTT WILL BE THE SENATE'S ONLY

864
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
BLACK MEMBER, BUT WILL ONLY HOLD

865
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
THE POSITION UNTIL THE ELECTION

866
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
IN 2014.

867
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
YOU MAIL RECALL THAT EARLIER

868
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
THIS MONTH, DeMINT SAID HE WAS

869
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
RESIGNING FROM THE SENATE BY

870
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
JANUARY 1st TO LEAD A

871
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
CONSERVATIVE THINK TANK WHERE HE

872
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
SAID HE COULD MAKE A BIGGER

873
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
DIFFERENCE THAN HE DOES IN THE

874
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
SENATE.

875
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
>> AND AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF

876
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
HOW THE AMERICAN EMBASSY HANDLED

877
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
THE ATTACK ON THE CONSULATE.

878
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
THEY WILL HAVE A CLOSED-DOOR

879
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
BRIEFING ON WEDNESDAY.

880
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
THEY'LL BE BRIEFED BY THE

881
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
MEMBERS WHO CONDUCTED THE

882
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
REVIEW.

883
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
>>> WELL, EARLIER TODAY, NEWTOWN

884
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
BEGAN THE UNBEARABLE TASK OF

885
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
SAYING GOOD-BYE TO TWO OF

886
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
FRIDAY'S YOUNGEST VICTIMS.

887
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
AS WE WERE COMING INTO NEWTOWN

888
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
FROM A DISTANCE, WE SAW A

889
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
GRAVEYARD AND A FUNERAL.

890
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
AND YOU CHOKE UP AND TEAR UP

891
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
JUST SEEING THAT.

892
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
IT BRINGS HOME JUST THE

893
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
MAGNITUDE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED

894
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
HERE.

895
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
6-YEAR-OLDS JACK PINTO AND NOAH

896
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
POZNER WERE BOTH LAID TO REST.

897
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
NOAH WAS A SMART LITTLE BOY.

898
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
HE LOVED READING AND PLAYING

899
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
WITH HIS SIBLINGS CALLING HIS

900
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
TWIN CENTRAL ASISTER, ARIEL, HI

901
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
FRIEND.

902
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
JACK PINTO WAS A HUGE FOOTBALL

903
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
FAN WHO LOVED THE NEW YORK

904
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
GIANTS.
THEY HAVE BEEN COVERING JACK'S

905
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
FUNERAL, AND SHE JOINS ME NOW.

906
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I KNOW HE LOVED THE GIANTS.

907
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
THAT WAS A REAL AREA OF PASSION

908
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
FOR THAT LITTLE BOY.

909
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HEARTBREAKING

910
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
TO BE THERE TODAY.

911
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
>> CERTAINLY, BECAUSE IT JUST

912
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

913
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING WHAT HAS

914
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
BEEN HAPPENING TO THIS TOWN, BUT

915
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
THEN TO SEE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE

916
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
SHOW UP AT THIS LITTLE BOY'S

917
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
FUNERAL, JUST A 6-YEAR-OLD BOY

918
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
IN THE FIRST GRADE.

919
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
THE PEOPLE YOU NORMALLY SEE SHOW

920
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
UP AT A FUNERAL, THEY'RE OLDER.

921
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
THE PEOPLE WHO CAME TODAY,

922
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
CHILDREN, 5-YEAR-OLDS,

923
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
6-YEAR-OLDS, 7-YEAR-OLD

924
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
CHILDREN.
THEY ARRIVED WEARING LONG

925
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
SLEEVED SHIRTS, SWEATSHIRTS THAT

926
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
HAD NEWTOWN WRESTLING ON IT.

927
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
THE FAMILY HAD ASKED FOR

928
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
PRIVACY, SO WE TRIED TO GIVE

929
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
THEM AS MUCH PRIVACY AS

930
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
POSSIBLE.
YOU THINK ABOUT THE GLOBAL

931
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
SPOTLIGHT.

932
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
THEY TRIED TO HAVE AS MUCH ALONE

933
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
TIME AS POSSIBLE, BUT CERTAINLY

934
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
THERE IS A LOT OF INTEREST IN

935
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THIS LITTLE BOY WHO LOVED SPORTS

936
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
SO MUCH.

937
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
ONE CHILD WHO SHOWED UP TO MOURN

938
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
TODAY, HE WAS ACTUALLY WEARING A

939
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
MEDAL.
AND THE MEDAL IS SIGNIFICANT

940
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
BECAUSE I SPOKE TO A MEMBER OF A

941
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
WRESTLING TEAM IN A NEARBY TOWN,

942
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
AND THIS TEAM SAYS THAT JACK HAD

943
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
JUST WON HIS FIRST MEDAL THIS

944
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
LAST WEEK.

945
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
HIS VERY FIRST MATCH, HE HAD WON

946
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
HIS FIRST MEDAL.

947
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
BUT AS YOU MENTIONED, HIS REAL

948
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
LOVE WAS FOOTBALL.

949
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
HE LOVED THE NEW YORK GIANTS.

950
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
HE LOVED VICTOR CRUZ.

951
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
AND THAT MESSAGE WENT ALL THE

952
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
WAY TO CRUZ.

953
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
HE TWEETED OUT THIS PICTURE.

954
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
HE TOOK A PICTURE OF HIS CLEATS

955
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
AND HIS GLOVES.

956
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
THEY HAD THE NAME JACK PINTO ON

957
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
IT.
HE SAID, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.

958
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
AND AFTER LAST NIGHT'S GAME,

959
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
HERE'S WHAT CRUZ TOLD REPORTERS.

960
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
>> IT WAS EMOTIONAL, MAN.

961
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
YOU KNOW, I WAS HOLDING BACK

962
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
TEARS TO DO IT.

963
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
IT FELT GOOD.

964
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
IT FELT GOOD TO HONOR A FAMILY

965
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
GOING THROUGH SO MUCH.
JUST THE THOUGHT OF YOUR LITTLE

966
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
ONE OR YOUR CHILD, YOUR SON OR

967
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
DAUGHTER GOING THROUGH SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, IT WAS -- YOU KNOW,

968
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE TO EVEN

969
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
LISTEN TO ON THE NEWS.

970
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
SO I PUT MY DAUGHTER INTO BED

971
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
WITH ME THAT NIGHT.

972
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
>> THE FAMILY REPORTEDLY WAS SO

973
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
MOVED AND KNEW HOW MUCH THEIR

974
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
LITTLE BOY LOVED CRUZ THAT THEY

975
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
BURIED HIM IN A VICTOR CRUZ

976
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000

THIS, ERIN, JUST THE VERY FIRST

977
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000

978
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000

1018

1020
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING A SKIT

1021
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
OR MAYBE THEY WERE CUB SCOUTS OR

1022
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
GIRL SCOUTS AND THEY WERE JUST

1023
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
PRACTICING BECAUSE THEY WERE

1024
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
SITTING SO NICELY.

1025
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000

AGITATED WAY SAYING IT'S GOING

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000

1028
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
AND HE KEPT RAISING HIS VOICE.

1029
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
AND I CAME TO THE CHILDREN AND

1030
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
THEY WERE CRYING AND WAILING AND

1031
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
MORTIFIED.

1032
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
AND THERE WAS A SCHOOL BUS

1033

1034
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
THEM INTO THE HOUSE.

1035
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000

INCIDENT AT THE SCHOOL.

1037
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS.

1038

1040
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000

1042
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
THEY JUST STARTED TALKING.

1043
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
THE TWO BOYS MOSTLY TALKED.

1044
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
AND THEY SAID, WE CAN'T GO BACK

1045
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
TO THAT SCHOOL.

1046
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
WE CAN'T --

1047
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
>> WE CAN'T GO BACK.

1048
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
>> OUR TEACHER -- OUR TEACHER IS

1049
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
DEAD.
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

1050
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
WE DON'T HAVE A TEACHER.

1051
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
AND I WAS -- I COULD NOT TAKE

1052
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
THAT IN.
I COULD NOT -- I COULD NOT

1053
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
ACCEPT THAT.
AND I JUST KEPT LISTENING TO

1054
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
THEM, AND THEN THEY TALKED MORE.

1055
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
AND THE BOY SAID, OH, NO, IT WAS

1056
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
A BIG GUN AND A SMALL GUN.

1057
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
THEN I KNEW.

1058
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
THEN THEY SAID THERE WAS BLOOD.

1059
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
THERE WAS BLOOD.

1060
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
AND THEN THEY SAID HER NAME.

1061
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
AND I PRAYED THAT IT WASN'T THAT

1062
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
TEACHER, AND IT WAS.

1063
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
>> VICKY SOTO.

1064
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000

1065
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000

I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY FLED.

1066
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I THINK SHE MUST HAVE PROTECTED

1067
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
THEM AND SAVED THEIR LIVES.

1068
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY RAN ALL THE

1069
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
WAY DOWN THE BOULEVARD, THE

1070
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
STREET NEXT TO THE FIRE HOUSE.

1071
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY GOT TO MY

1072
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
HOUSE.
THEY WERE SO BRAVE.

1073
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
AND THEY WERE SO GOOD.

1074
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
AND I BROUGHT DOWN SOME TOYS

1075
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
FROM MY GRANDSON'S TOY CHEST AND

1076
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I GAVE THEM SOME JUICE.

1077
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
AND WE CALLED THEIR PARENTS.

1078
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
THEY WERE VERY BRAVE AND VERY

1079
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
GOOD.

1080
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
AND I WAS AMAZED.

1081
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I WAS ASTOUNDED AT WHAT THEY

1082
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
WERE TELLING ME.

1083
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
>> THEY NOTICE EVERYTHING.

1084
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I KNOW YOU'RE A PSYCHOLOGIST BY

1085
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000

1086
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
BEING A GRANDFATHER.

1087
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
THAT WAS THE GRANDFATHER THAT

1088
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
WAS YOU AT THAT MOMENT?

1089
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000

ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN WHICH
EXPIRED IN 2004.

1269
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

1270
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
THAT SENATORS ARE TALKING ABOUT

1271
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
LOOKING AT.
SO THE FACT THAT THESE TWO

1272
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
SENATORS WITH A RATINGS FROM THE

1273
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
NRA ARE SAYING THEY'RE OPEN TO

1274
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
THIS KIND OF A CONVERSATION IS

1275
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
REALLY SIGNIFICANT.

1276
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
>> ALL RIGHT, JOHN AVLON, THANK

SANDY HOOK PRINCIPAL DAWN

1285
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
HOCHSPRUNG WAS ONE OF THEM.

1286
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
OUR NEXT GUEST HAS LIVED IN THIS

1287
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
COMMUNITY FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS.

1288

REMEMBER.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1295
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I KNOW THREE CHILDREN.

1296
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN HAS FRIENDS

1297
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
WHO HAVE LOST SIBLINGS?

1298
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
>> YES.

1299
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT DAWN.

1300
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
YOU KNEW HER WELL.

1301
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
YOU WORKED WITH HER FOR A WHILE.

1302
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
>> I DIDN'T KNOW HER WELL.

1303
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I WORKED WITH HER BECAUSE I WAS

1304
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
VERY ACTIVE AS MOM IN THE

1305
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
SCHOOL.
YES, MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER, WHEN

1306
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
SHE WAS THERE, DAWN WAS THERE AT

1307
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
THE SAME TIME.

1308
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
YEAH, DAWN WAS AN UNUSUAL

1309
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
PRINCIPAL.

1310
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
SHE DIDN'T HAVE THAT FORMALITY

1311
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
THAT A LOT OF, YOU KNOW,

1312
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
ADMINISTRATORS MIGHT HAVE.

1313
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
SHE HAD THIS RADIANT SMILE.

1314
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
SHE WAS ALWAYS ABOUT FUN AND

1315
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
WARMTH.

1316
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU KIND OF FELT

1317
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
LIKE YOU COULD JUST GIVE HER A

1318
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
HUG AS SOON AS YOU MET HER.

1319
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
SHE HAD A RARE QUALITY.

1320
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
>> HOW DO YOU -- HOW DO YOU

1321
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
FEEL, AND HOW DOES THIS TOWN

1322
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
FEEL, JUST BEING HERE?

1323
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
IT IS A PICTURE-PERFECT LITTLE

1324
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
TOWN.
AND IT'S SMALL.

1325
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
AND IT FEELS LIKE EVERYBODY HERE

1326
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
WOULD KNOW EVERYBODY ELSE.

1327
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
>> YEAH, WELL, WE ARE ALL
CONNECTED HERE.

1328
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
YEAH.
I FELT A LITTLE BIT CONFLICTED

1329
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
TONIGHT ABOUT COMING OUT.

1330
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT

1331
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

1332
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
BUT I FELT LIKE COY HAVE AN

1333
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

1334
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE GRIEF THAT

1335
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
WE'RE FEELING AS A COMMUNITY.

1336
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
YOU KNOW, WE FEEL -- WE FEEL

1337
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
NUMB.
WE'RE CARRYING OUR GRIEF AROUND

1338
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
WITH US.

1339
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
WE HAVE THE THOUGHTS OF THE

1340
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
PARENTS WHO LOST THEIR CHILDREN

1341
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
IN OUR MINDS ALL THE TIME.

1342
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
AND IT'S HARD.

1343
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
EVERYTHING HAS STOPPED NOW.

1344
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
IT'S HARD -- IT'S HARD TO GET ON

1345
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
WITH YOUR ROUTINE.

1346
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, ACTUALLY.

1347
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE

1348
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
COFFEE WITHOUT FORGETTING WHAT

1349
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I'M DOING HALFWAY THROUGH.

1350
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT TO

1351
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
GET THE MESSAGE OUT TO MY

1352
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS,

1353
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
ESPECIALLY THE ONES WHO ARE

1354
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
GRIEVING THE MOST, WHO HAVE LOST

1355
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
LOVED ONES THAT WE'RE IN THIS

1356
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
TOGETHER AND THAT THERE IS SO

1357
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
MUCH GOOD IN THE WORLD, AND THAT

1358
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
WE'RE GOING TO HOLD ON TO IT

1359
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
TOGETHER.
>> I KNOW THAT YOU WERE TELLING

1360
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
A PERSONAL STORY JUST ABOUT HOW

1361
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
IT'S HARD TO SLEEP.
>> YEAH.

1362
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
>> BUT WHEN YOU DOZED OFF A

1363
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
LITTLE BIT LAST NIGHT AND WOKE

1364
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
UP, YOU HAD TO WAKE YOUR HUSBAND

1365
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
UP JUST TO SEE IF IT WAS REAL.

1366
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
>> I WOKE HIM UP AND I SAID TO

1367
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
HIM IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?

1368
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
AND THAT'S A LINE THAT HAS BEEN

1369
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD.

1370
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
AND I MENTIONED THAT TO FRIENDS

1371
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
OF MINE, AND THEY ALL COULD

1372
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
REALLY RELATE TO THAT.

1373
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE IT.

1374
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE WHEN

1375
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA GAVE THAT
BEAUTIFUL SPEECH LAST NIGHT AND

1376
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
HE LISTED THE MASSACRES THAT

1377
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
HAVE HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY,

1378
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
THE TRAGIC EVENTS.

1379
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
AND AT THE END OF IT CAME THE

1380
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
NAME OF OUR LITTLE TOWN THAT NO

1381
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
ONE ELSE USED TO, YOU KNOW -- I

1382
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
USED TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHERE IT

1383
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
WAS.

1384
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
THAT WAS SHOCKING.
>> AND YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE

1385
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
THAT WAY.
AND YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE

1386
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
COLUMBINE.

1387
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
>> EXACTLY.
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO ASSOCIATE

1388
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
THE NAME OF OUR TOWN WITH THIS

1389
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.
OUR TOWN IS SO MUCH MORE THAN

1390
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
THAT.

1391
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
IT'S A REALLY SPECIAL PLACE

1392
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
WHERE PARENTS ARE SO COMMITTED

1393
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
TO THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION

1394
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
AND BRINGING THEM UP WELL.

1395
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
AND MY KIDS HAVE SUCH WONDERFUL

1396
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
MEMORIES OF SANDY HOOK.

1397
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
IT'S A HUGE PART OF THEIR

1398
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
CHILDHOOD.
HAVE I WONDERFUL MEMORIES THERE

1399
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
AND I WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO

1400
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE MEMORIES

1401
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
AND NOT THINK OF IT AS THE CRIME
SCENE.

1402
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
>> THIS IS A TOUGH QUESTION TO

1403
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
ASK GIVEN MY ROLE, BUT THE

1404
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
MEDIA, WHEN I WALK AROUND HERE,

1405
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE ME.

1406
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
WE'RE TRYING COVER THIS STORY,

1407
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
BUT I KNOW THAT WE'RE MAKING IT

1408
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
HARD TOO IN SOME WAYS FOR YOU.

1409
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
>> YEAH.
THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT, ERIN.

1410
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
YOU KNOW, I CAME DOWN A COUPLE

1411
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
OF DAYS AGO.

1412
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I CAME DOWN TO THE CENTER OF

1413
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
SANDY HOOK HERE WHEN THE MEDIA

1414
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
WAS HERE.

1415
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
AND I KEPT BUMPING INTO FRIENDS,

1416
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
AND FRIENDS OF FRIENDS, AND WE

1417
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
WOULD HOLD EACH OTHER AND

1418
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
EMBRACE EACH OTHER AND COME

1419
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
TOGETHER.
AND THAT FEELS VITAL RIGHT NOW.

1420
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
AND WHEN I CAME HERE TONIGHT, I

1421
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
DIDN'T SEE ANYBODY I KNEW.

1422
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
AND WE REALLY FEEL THAT THE

1423
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
NATION FEELS OUR PAIN AND WANTS

1424
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
TO REACH OUT AND WANTS TO BE

1425
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
HERE WITH US.

1426
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
AND THAT MEANS A GREAT DEAL.

1427
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT'S HARD TO

1428
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
NOT BE ABLE TO GET -- TO DRIVE

1429
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
AROUND YOUR OWN TOWN, WHEN

1430
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
REALLY WHAT WE NEED IS TO BE

1431
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
TOGETHER.

1432
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
>> MIRANDA, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1433
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
>> THANK YOU.

1434
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
>> WE APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE

1435
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
TIME TO SHARE WITH US.

1436
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
>> THANK YOU.
>>> AND UP NEXT, A TOWN FOREVER

1437
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
CHANGED.

1438
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
ADDING A FRIEND...

1439
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
♪

1440
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
...COULD END
WITH ADDING A CLOSE FRIEND.

1441
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
THE LEXUS DECEMBER TO REMEMBER
SALES EVENT IS ON.

1442
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,000
THIS IS THE PURSUIT
OF PERFECTION.

1443
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
FIVE DAYS LATER,
I HAD A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK.

1444
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
BAYER ASPIRIN WAS THE FIRST
THING THE EMTS GAVE ME.
