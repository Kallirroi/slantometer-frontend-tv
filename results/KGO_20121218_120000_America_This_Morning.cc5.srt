CEILING FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
BUT IT'S NOT WHO YOU THINK.

IT WAS ALL FOR HER LITTLE

A RITUAL RETURNS FOR THOUSANDS

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
THEY'RE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL

TASK.

33
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
PARENTS ARE DOING WHAT THEY

34
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO.

6-YEAR-OLD NOAH POZNER WAS

36
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000

STORIES.

44
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
>> SHE TOLD HIM, I LOVE YOU.

45
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
MOMENT HE INFORMED PARENTS THEIR

57
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
CHILDREN HAD DIED.

58

NOW, HE WILL ATTEND SO MANY

59
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
FUNERALS.

60
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000

61
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000

A YOUNG MAN THAT SEEMED TO BE

66
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
UNRAVELING.

67
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
FOR YEARS, HER MOTHER, NANCY,

68
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
SHARED HER STRUGGLES WITH ADAM'S

THEM IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS,

75
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
ADAM WAS SO TROUBLED, HE WOULD

76
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE.

77
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
>> SHE HOMESCHOOLED HIM AND

78

EVERYTHING.

79
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I KNEW HE WAS ON MEDICATION.

80
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
BUT THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

AND INTRODUCED HIM TO THE WORLD

OF HIGH-POWERED GUNS.

91
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
THIS FRIDAY, THE GOVERNOR OF

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
BACK TO CLASS LATER TODAY.

102

THOSE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

104
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
RIGHT, ROB.

106
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
THE STUDENTS AT OTHER SCHOOLS

107
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
WILL RETURN TO CLASS.

108
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
BUT WITH A LOT OF POLICE AND

109
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
WITH GRIEF COUNSELORS.

110
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

111
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000

IT'S GOING TO BE CHALK HILL

114

SCHOOL.

115
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
THE SCHOOL HASN'T HAD STUDENTS

116
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
FOR A FEW YEARS.

117
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
THEY'RE MOVING DESKS AND OTHER

118
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000

TAHMAN BRADLEY LIVE IN NEWTOWN,

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
CONNECTICUT, THIS MORNING.

128
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT,

129
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
TAHMAN.
>>> ON TOP OF THAT, WE ARE

130
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
LEARNING MORE ABOUT GUNMAN ADAM

131
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
LANZA'S PARENTS AND THEIR

132
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
TROUBLES.

133
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
ACCORDING TO A SOURCE CLOSE TO

134
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
PETER LANZA, THE BOY'S FATHER

135
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE BACK IN

136
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
APRIL OF 2001.

137
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
NOW, PETER AND ADAM LANZA SPENT

138
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
MOST OF THEIR WEEKENDS TOGETHER

139
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
UNTIL 2010.

140
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
THAT YEAR WAS THE LAST TIME ADAM

141
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
LANZA SAW EITHER HIS FATHER OR

142
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
HIS BROTHER, RYAN.

143
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
THOSE WHO KNEW ADAM SAY HE HAD

144
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
BEHAVIORAL ISSUES, NEEDED

145
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
CONSTANT SUPERVISION AND SIMPLY

146
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
DIDN'T RESPOND TO EITHER

147
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL PAIN.

148
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
>> IF HE HAD CUT HIMSELF OR HURT

149
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
HIMSELF, HE WOULD NOT KNOW IT OR

150
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
FEEL IT.

151
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
SO, WE WERE BEING VERY, VERY

152
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
CAREFUL WITH HIM.
>> POLICE ARE STILL HAVING

153
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
TROUBLE FINDING A MOTIVE IN ALL

154
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
OF THIS.

155
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
A COMPUTER, THOUGH, TAKEN FROM

156
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
ADAM LANZA'S HOME IN NEWTOWN WAS

157
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
BADLY DAMAGED.

158
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
INVESTIGATORS ALSO SAY THEY

159
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
FOUND, QUOTE, SIGNIFICANT

160
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
EVIDENCE IN THAT HOUSE THAT

161
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
LANZA SHARED WITH HIS MOTHER

162
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
BEFORE KILLING HER.

163
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
>>> AND IN LIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY,

164
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
AMERICANS ARE TALKING ONCE AGAIN

165
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL.
A NEW ABC NEWS POLL FOUND THAT

166
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
54% OF AMERICANS FAVOR STRICTER

167
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
GUN CONTROL LAWS.

168
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
AND MORE THAN HALF SAY THE

169
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
SHOOTING REFLECTS BROADER

170
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
PROBLEMS IN OUR SOCIETY, NOT

171
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
JUST ONE TROUBLED PERSON.

172
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
ONE LEADING DEMOCRATIC SENATOR

173
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
SAYS, THIS MAY BE THE TIPPING

174
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
POINT.

175
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
BUT ANOTHER LAWMAKER SAYS, MORE

176
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
GUNS ARE THE ANSWER.

177
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
>> I DON'T KNOW ANYONE IN THE

178
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
SPORTING OR HUNTING ARENA THAT

179
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
GOES OUT WITH AN ASSAULT RIFLE.

180
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE THAT NEEDS

181
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
30 ROUNDS AND A CLIP TO GO

182
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
HUNTING.

183
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
>> SHE TAKES HIM OUT, TAKES HIS

184
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
HEAD OFF BEFORE HE CAN KILL

185
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
THOSE PRECIOUS KIDS.

186
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
>> AND TEXAS GOVERNOR, RICK

187
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
PERRY, SAYS HE SUPPORTS ARMING

188
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
TEACHERS IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES

189
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000

INTERCEPTED.
HIS FOURTH PICK OF THE GAME.

561
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
HIS FOURTH GAME WITH AT LEAST

562

565
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000

SANCHEZ, WOULD YOU?

570
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
NOPE.

571
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
FUMBLES THE SNAP.

572
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
SANCHEZ, TURNOVERS THIS SEASON,

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000

AND IT'S A SENTIMENT THAT'S

597
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
DEFINITELY SPREADING.
STAY WITH UTHIS

598
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
A REGULAR GUY
WITH AN IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT.

599
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
THE USUAL, BOB?

600
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
NOT TODAY.

601
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
[ Male Announcer ]
BOB HAS AFIB:

602
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION NOT CAUSED
BY A HEART VALVE PROBLEM,

603
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
A CONDITION THAT PUTS HIM
AT GREATER RISK FOR A STROKE.

604

[ GPS ] TURN LEFT.

605
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I DON'T THINK SO.

606
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
[ Male Announcer ]
FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN,

607
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
AND MADE A MONTHLY TRIP TO THE
CLINIC TO GET HIS BLOOD TESTED.

608
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

609
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
BOB'S DOCTOR RECOMMENDED
A DIFFERENT OPTION:

610
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
ONCE-A-DAY XARELTO®.

611
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
XARELTO® IS THE FIRST AND ONLY

612
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
ONCE-A-DAY PRESCRIPTION
BLOOD THINNER

613
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
FOR PATIENTS WITH AFIB

614
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
NOT CAUSED
BY A HEART VALVE PROBLEM,

615
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE
ROUTINE BLOOD MONITORING.

616
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
LIKE WARFARIN,
XARELTO® IS PROVEN EFFECTIVE

617
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
TO REDUCE THE RISK
OF AN AFIB-RELATED STROKE.

618
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
THERE IS LIMITED DATA
ON HOW THESE DRUGS COMPARE

619
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
WHEN WARFARIN IS WELL MANAGED.

620
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
NO ROUTINE BLOOD MONITORING

621
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
MEANS BOB CAN SPEND HIS
EXTRA TIME HOWEVER HE LIKES.

622
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
NEW ZEALAND!

623
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
XARELTO®
IS JUST ONE PILL A DAY,

624
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
TAKEN WITH THE EVENING MEAL.

625
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
AND WITH
NO DIETARY RESTRICTIONS,

626
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
BOB CAN EAT THE HEALTHY FOODS
HE LIKES.

627
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
DO NOT STOP TAKING
XARELTO® RIVAROXABAN

628
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
WITHOUT TALKING TO THE DOCTOR
WHO PRESCRIBES IT FOR YOU.

629
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
STOPPING MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK
OF HAVING A STROKE.

630
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY

631
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
IF YOU DEVELOP ANY SIGNS
OR SYMPTOMS OF BLEEDING,

632
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING
OR TINGLING.

633
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
YOU MAY HAVE A HIGHER RISK
OF BLEEDING

634
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
IF YOU TAKE XARELTO®
WITH ASPIRIN PRODUCTS,

635
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
NSAIDS OR BLOOD THINNERS.

636
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
BEFORE TAKING XARELTO®

637
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE
ABNORMAL BLEEDING.

638
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
XARELTO® CAN CAUSE BLEEDING,
WHICH CAN BE SERIOUS,

639
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
AND RARELY MAY LEAD TO DEATH.

640
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
YOU ARE LIKELY TO BRUISE
MORE EASILY ON XARELTO®,

641
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
AND IT MAY TAKE LONGER
FOR BLEEDING TO STOP.

642
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
TELL YOUR DOCTORS
YOU ARE TAKING XARELTO®

643
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
BEFORE ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
OR DENTAL PROCEDURES.

644
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
BEFORE STARTING XARELTO®,
TELL YOUR DOCTOR

645
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
ABOUT ANY CONDITIONS,
SUCH AS KIDNEY, LIVER

646
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
OR BLEEDING PROBLEMS.

647
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
READY TO CHANGE YOUR ROUTINE?

648
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000

ABOUT ONCE-A-DAY XARELTO®.

I NEVER WORRIED ABOUT IT BEFORE.
