IN THE FIRST CENTURY B.C.

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'M EAGER TO ROLE UP MY SLEEVES
AND START DIGGING,

178

A PRIMER

EFFORT INTO IT.

It just wouldn't go away.

266
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
My doctor diagnosed it
as fibromyalgia,

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
thought to be the
result of overactive nerves

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
that cause chronic
widespread pain.

269
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Lyrica is believed
to calm these nerves.

270
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I learned Lyrica can provide
significant relief

271
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
from fibromyalgia pain.

272
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000

Lyrica is not for everyone.

276
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Lyrica may cause serious
allergic reactions

277
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
or suicidal thoughts or actions.

278
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000

or tired feeling.

284

Common side effects
are dizziness, sleepiness,

WILL BE THE NEXT YOUNG LADY
TO BE MARRIED.

348
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
NORMALLY, IN A WEDDING,

349
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
IT'S A LITTLE MORE PRIVATE,

350
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
SO IT SEEMS LIKE THE WHOLE TOWN
IS HERE FOR THE BRIDE.

351
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
- YES, YOU SEE, ALL THIS BEAUTY
HAS TO BE SHARED

OVER THE CENTURIES.

IN A FINAL PREWEDDING BLESSING,

TO THE CHURCH THROUGH
THE STREETS OF KYPEROUNTA.

HAS SHOWN UP,

364
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
AND I MEAN EVERYONE.

365
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
- PEOPLE HERE ARE VERY FRIENDLY

366
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
AND THEY'RE CLOSE TOGETHER.

367
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000

AND THIS--I'M VERY PROUD
OF ALL THIS.

I MEAN, MORE THAN 2,000 PEOPLE
IN THE PARTY

371
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
BECAUSE WE KNOW EACH OTHER.

372
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
IN THE UNITED STATES,

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
ALWAYS THE BIG ARGUMENT
BETWEEN THE BRIDE AND THE GROOM

IS THE GUEST LIST,
WHO'S INVITED.

BUT HERE IT SEEMS LIKE
EVERYBODY'S INVITED.

I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO BE GOING TO A WEDDING TODAY,

408
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
BUT MAYBE THIS
WAS VERY SYMBOLIC

409
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
OF A SMALL CYPRIOT VILLAGE.

410
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
PEOPLE HERE ARE FRIENDLY,

411
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
SO THIS WAS A GREAT TRADITION

412
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
AND IT WAS REALLY NICE
TO BE PART OF IT.

WITH THAT KIND OF MONEY

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
IS CLEOPATRA.

- A LITTLE WATER.

519
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
- ONCE WE MADE IT
INTO A FAIRLY WET MUD...

520
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
- OKAY.

521
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
- YOU'RE GONNA WALK IN IT.

522
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
- YOU KNOW, THE MARKETING PERSON
IN ME SAYS

523
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I WOULD SELL THIS AS, LIKE,
CLEOPATRA'S MUD--

524
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
YEAH, SOME THERAPY THING
FOR PEOPLE

525
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
AND SAY, "OKAY, THIS IS A BEAUTY
SECRET OF CLEOPATRA."

526
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
AND WHAT'S GONNA HOLD
THIS MUD TOGETHER?

527
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
- WE'RE GONNA TREAD IN
WITH OUR BARE FEET TOGETHER

528
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
THIS WHEAT CHAFF.

529
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
- I'M GONNA PUT THIS IN A JAR

530
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
AND SELL IT
IN SOME BEAUTY STORE.

531
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
- SO I'M GONNA START PUTTING
THE CHAFF WHEAT NOW.

532
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
- I KNEW I WAS GONNA GET
MY HANDS DIRTY,

533
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.

534
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
IT ACTUALLY FEELS KIND OF NICE
BETWEEN THE TOES.

535
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
- YEAH, IT'S NICE, ISN'T IT?
- YEAH, IT IS.

536
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
[squelching]

537
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
ALL RIGHT, I AM READY
TO RECONSTRUCT HISTORY.

538
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
- OKAY, WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO WET IT DOWN A BIT FIRST

539
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
SINCE IT'S PRET

540
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
WET IT A LITTLE.

541
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
- SOMETHING TELLS ME
THE TECHNIQUE

542
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
IS NOT AS INVOLVED
IN SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS.

543
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
- THE REASON THAT WE'RE SECURING
THIS STRIP OF EARTH

544
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
BENEATH THE WALL IS THAT
IT'S FAIRLY LOOSE AND FRAGILE,

545
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
AND WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME,

546
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
IT WILL BECOME ERODED AWAY
AND THE WALL WILL COLLAPSE.

547
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
WITH GOOD LUCK,
IT SHOULD LAST SEVERAL YEARS

548
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
BEFORE WE HAVE TO RENEW IT.

549
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
- YOU KNOW, I MAY HAVE FOUND
MY CALLING.

550
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
[both chuckle]

551
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
JOAN CERTAINLY PUT ME TO WORK

552
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
DURING MY BRIEF VISIT
TO YERONISOS,

553
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
AND I LOVED IT.

554
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE THRILL
TO UNEARTH AN ARTIFACT

555
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
LAST TOUCHED BY SOMEONE WHO
LIVED THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO.

556
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
JOAN'S STILL SEARCHING
FOR THE DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE

557
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
THAT PROVES CLEOPATRA
BUILT THIS TEMPLE,

558
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT
SHE'LL SOON FIND IT.

559
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
- THIS IS THE KIND OF PLACE

560
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
WHERE YOU CAN TEASE OUT
THE HISTORY

561
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
THAT FALLS BETWEEN THE CRACKS.

562
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
JOB.
WHERE YOU CAN TEASE OUT
SO THIS IS OUR JOB.

563
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
THIS IS THRILLING.

564
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
AND WE CONTRIBUTE

565
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
IN OUR OWN SMALL WAY

566
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
TO TELLING THE STORY
OF THE LONG MARCH OF HISTORY.

567
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
- UP NEXT, WE PARTY
WITH JOAN'S TEAM

568
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
AND CELEBRATE HER BIRTHDAY.

569
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
[rhythmic clapping]

570
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
stuffed with a gooey center

571
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
toasted up all golden brown

572
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
then given a delicious design?

573
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
A toaster strudel.

574
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Pillsbury Toaster Strudel.

575
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So Delicious...So Fun.

576
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And when I get a cold I take
Coricidin HBP.

577
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
The number one pharmacist
recommended cold brand

578
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
designed for people with high
blood pressure.

579
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Coricidin HBP.

580
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
[rhythmic clapping
and fiddling]

581
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
- OUR TIME ON CYPRUS HAS BEEN
A REMARKABLE COMBINATION

582
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
OF HISTORY AND HOSPITALITY.

583
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
IT FEELS LIKE EVERYONE
HAS SHOWN UP

584
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
TO CELEBRATE
THE YERONISOS DIG TEAM

585
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
AND JOAN'S BIRTHDAY.

586
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
- WELCOME, EVERYONE.

587
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
THIS IS OUR 22ND ANNUAL
YERONISOS ISLAND DIG PARTY.

588
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
THEY SEEM TO BE GETTING BETTER
AND BETTER.

589
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
- WITH JOAN AS OUR
UNOFFICIAL AMBASSADOR,

590
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
WE COULDN'T HAVE HOPED
FOR A MORE WELCOMING

591
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
AND EXHILARATING EXPERIENCE
WITH THE PEOPLE OF CYPRUS.

592
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
AS WE SING AND DANCE
INTO THE NIGHT,

593
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
IT FEELS LIKE THIS GATHERING

594
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
IS A HEARTFELT WAY
FOR ALL OF US

595
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
TO SAY HONORING OUR TRADITIONS
IS A WONDERFUL THING.

596
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
SHARING THEM WITH FRIENDS
IS EVEN BETTER.

597
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
[cheers and applause]

598
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
SAM: TODAY ON SEA
RESCUE, A DOLPHIN

599
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
BEACHES ON SHORE WITH

600
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
GRUESOME INJURIES ALL

601
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
OVER ITS BODY.

602
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
JON: IT'S PHENOMENAL

603
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
THAT THE ANIMAL WAS

604
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
STILL ALIVE.

605
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
SAM: NOW IT'S UP TO

606
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
RESCUERS TO SAVE HIM.

607
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'M SAM CHAMPION, AND

608
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
WE'RE ON A SEA RESCUE.
