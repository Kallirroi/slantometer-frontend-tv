00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
BEFORE.

53
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
HE AND HIS CREW WERE GRABBED

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
AFTER CROSSING INTO NORTHWEST

55
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
SYRIA LAST THURSDAY.

56
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
THERE HAD BEEN NO COMMUNICATION

57
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
WITH THEM, NO CONTACT, NO RANSOM

58
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
DEMANDS.

59
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
THEY WERE THROWN IN THE BACK OF

60
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
A TRUCK, BOUND AND BLINDFOLDED,

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
ALTHOUGH NOT PHYSICALLY HARMED.

62
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
THEN YESTERDAY, AS THE CAPTORS

63
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
WERE MOVING THEM TO A NEW

64
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
LOCATION, THEY WERE STOPPED AT A

65
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
REBEL CHECKPOINT.

66
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
THERE WAS A CONFRONTATION.

67
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
AND THEN, THE FIREFIGHT BROKE

68
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
OUT.

69
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
IN THAT FIREFIGHT, TWO OF THE

70
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
CAPTORS WERE KILLED AND SEVERAL

71
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
OTHERS ESCAPED.

72
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
BUT RICHARD AND HIS CREW WERE

73
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
RESCUED.

74
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
THE SYRIAN REBELS THEN DROVE HIM

75
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
TO THE BORDER TO SAFETY.

76
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000

WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE GROUP

THAT TOOK THEM HOSTAGE?

81
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
>> WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE

82
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
GROUP.

83
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
BUT THEY WERE NOT BELIEVED TO BE

84
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
LOYAL TO THE ASSAD REGIME, NOR

85
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
WERE THOSE WHO RESCUED HIM.

86
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
THERE'S SO MANY REBEL GROUPS IN
THAT AREA.

87
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
THIS WAS KEPT QUIET BECAUSE

88
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
RICHARD IS A VERY HIGH-PROFILE

89
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
REPORTER.

90
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
AND THEY DID NOT WANT TO

91
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
INCREASE HIS VALUE TO THE
CAPTORS.

92
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
>> FOR FEAR THAT SOMETHING WOULD
HAPPEN TO HIM.

93
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
AND, OF COURSE, THERE'S BEEN SO

94
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
MUCH VIOLENCE IN SYRIA OVER THE

95
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000

THE NATION IS STILL IN SHOCK.

100
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
AND A TOWN MUST BID GOOD-BYE TO

101
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000

KUNIS, AND DOZENS OF OTHERS,

370
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
MOSTLY IN THE ENTERTAINMENT

371
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
INDUSTRY.

372
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
JOHANSSON TOLD THE JUDGE SHE HAD
BEEN TRULY HUMILIATED.

373
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
>>> FINALLY, TAKE IT FROM ME.

374
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
DO NOT LOOK DOWN.
THE WORLD'S HIGHEST, AND THUS,

375
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
SCARIEST PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE, HAS
OPENED IN THE SWISS ALPS.

376
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
>> NO WAY.
>> PASS.

377
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
>> NOT A FAN.

378
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
>> IT IS THREE FEET WIDE.

379
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
IT IS SUSPENDED 1,500 FEET ABOVE
A GLACIER.

380
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
>> NO.

381
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
>> VISIBILITY SO POOR ON OPENING

382
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
DAY --
>> WHY?

383
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
>> -- THEY SAY YOU COULDN'T SEE

384
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
WHAT WAS UNDER YOUR FEET.

385
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
PERHAPS THE MOST UNUSED BRIDGE

386
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
IN HUMAN HISTORY IS THERE.

387
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
>> AT LEAST BY OUR TEAM.

388
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
>> NO TO AND FROM.

389
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
>> WHEREVER IT NEEDS TO GO, I

390
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
HOPE YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING

391
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
OVER THERE.

392
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
>> YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING
THERE.

393
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
>> SOMEBODY'S GOT A SPECIAL
ASSIGNMENT COMING UP.

394
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
>> NO WAY.

395
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
>>> WE TURN TO WHAT MAY BE A

396
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN THE

397
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
STALEMATE OVER THE FISCAL CLIFF.

398
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
EVERYONE'S TAXES GO UP.

399
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
EVERY GOVERNMENT PROGRAM SET TO

400
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
GET CUT IN JUST 14 DAYS.

401
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
AFTER A NEW OFFER FROM THE WHITE

402
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
HOUSE LAST NIGHT, THE TWO SIDES
MAY HAVE A DEAL IN SIGHT.

403
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
ABC'S JON KARL IS ON CAPITOL

404
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
HILL.

405
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
A CRUCIAL TEST TODAY, WHEN HOUSE

406
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER WILL TALK
TO HIS TROOPS ABOUT WHERE THINGS

407
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
STAND.

408
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
>> Reporter: THE SPEAKER WILL
SPEAK WITH THE RANK AND FILE

409
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
HOUSE REPUBLICANS LATER THIS
MORNING ABOUT THIS LATEST OFFER

410
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

411
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
ALTHOUGH, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

412
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
DIFFERENCES, WE'RE NOW SEEING,

413
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
FOR THE FIRST TIME, REAL SIGNS

414
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
OF PROGRESS.

415
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
THE PRESIDENT IS MAKING SOME

416
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
SIGNIFICANT CONCESSIONS,

417
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
OFFERING MORE SPENDING CUTS,

418
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
ASKING FOR LESS IN THE WAY OF

419
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
TAX INCREASES.

420
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
THE OFFER INCLUDES $1.2 TRILLION

421
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
IN TAX INCREASES.

422
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
THAT'S DOWN FROM $1.6 TRILLION

423
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
THE PRESIDENT HAD INITIALLY

424
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
ASKED FOR.

425
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
HE IS TALKING ABOUT RAISING

426
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
TAXES ON THOSE MAKING OVER

427
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
$400,000 A YEAR INSTEAD OF

428
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
$250,000 A YEAR.

429
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
AND HE IS TALKING ABOUT LIMITING

430
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
THE AMOUNT OF COST OF LIVING

431
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
INCREASES FOR SOCIAL SECURITY

432
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
RECIPIENTS.

433
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
AND ASKING FOR A TWO-YEAR

434
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
EXTENSION OF THE DEBT LIMIT, NOT

435
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
AN INDEFINITE EXTENSION OF THE
DEBT LIMIT.

436
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
GEORGE, THERE ARE STILL PROBLEMS

437
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
FROM THE REPUBLICANS ON THIS.

438
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
THEY STILL THINK IT'S TOO MUCH

439
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
IN TAX INCREASES, NOT ENOUGH IN

440
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
SPENDING CUTS.

441
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
BUT THE SPEAKER CALLED IT A STEP
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

442
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
>> IT SEEMS LIKE A PROBLEM OF

443
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
MATH.
DOES THE WHITE HOUSE HAVE ANY

444
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
MORE ROOM TO MANEUVER?
OR IS THIS THEIR BOTTOM LINE?

445
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
>> Reporter: WHITE HOUSE

446
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
OFFICIALS TOLD ME LATE LAST

447
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
NIGHT, THIS IS NOT A FINAL

448
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
OFFER.

449
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
THEY DO CONSIDER IT A GOOD FAITH

450
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
EFFORT TO MEET THE SPEAKER

451
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
HALFWAY.

452
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
IT'S CLOSE TO A FINAL OFFER.

453
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
BUT THERE'S STILL WIGGLE ROOM.

454
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
AND YES, GEORGE, NOW THEY'RE

455
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
QUIBBLING ABOUT NUMBERS, NOT

456
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
TALKING ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL

457
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
DISAGREEMENTS.

458
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
>> OKAY, JON KARL, THANKS VERY

459
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
MUCH.

460
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
>>> WE TURN TO OUR ABC NEWS

461
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
ONGOING COMMITMENT TO THE SEARCH
FOR SOLUTIONS TO GUN VIOLENCE.

462
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA PROMISED ACTION

463
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
ON SUNDAY AT THAT INTERFAITH

464
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
VIGIL FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE

465
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
NEWTOWN SHOOTINGS.

466
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
AT LEAST ONE PRO-GUN RIGHTS

467
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
ADVOCATE IN THE SENATE SAID

468
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
EVERYTHING SHOULD BE ON THE
TABLE.

469
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
ABC'S PIERRE THOMAS HAS THE

470
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
LATEST ON THE CALL TO ACTION.

471
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
GOOD MORNING, PIERRE.

472
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING,
ELIZABETH.

473
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
MANY AMERICANS ARE DEMANDING

474
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
THAT SOMETHING BE DONE TO STOP

475
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
NIGHTMARES LIKE WHAT WE SAW IN

476
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
NEWTOWN.

477
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
WHAT THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE IS

478
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
WHERE THE FIGHT BEGINS.

479
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
>> All: SHAME ON THE NRA.

480
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
>> Reporter: AT NRA HEADQUARTERS

481
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
IN VIRGINIA ON MONDAY, AN ANGRY

482
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
CROWD.

483
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
>> All: SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.

484
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
>> Reporter: HORDES OF ACTIVISTS
PROTESTING THE GUN LOBBY.

485
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
AND THE DEBATE IGNITED AGAIN.

486
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
BUT THOSE IN SUPPORT OF THE NRA

487
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
QUESTIONED WHETHER THE ASSAULT

488
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
RIFLE USED IN THE NEWTOWN

489
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
MASSACRE WAS REALLY THE ISSUE.

490
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST

491
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
JOHN FUND CALLED IN YESTERDAY.

492
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THE LAWS
DON'T WORK.

493
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
THESE MASS KILLINGS ARE BECAUSE

494
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
OF PSYCHOTIC OR MENTALLY ILL

495
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
INDIVIDUALS.

496
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
>> Reporter: BUT SOME POLITICAL

497
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
LEADERS ARE FED UP WITH THE

498
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
NATION'S GUN VIOLENCE.

499
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
34 AMERICANS ARE KILLED EVERY

500
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
DAY BY FIREARMS.

501
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
>> THIS IS JUST RIDICULOUS.

502
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.

503
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
WE ARE KILLING EACH OTHER.

504
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
AND WE'RE THE ONLY

505
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY IN THE

506
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
WORLD DOING IT.

507
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
>> Reporter: THE NATION HAS

508
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
FOUGHT THIS BATTLE BEFORE.

509
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
IN 1994, CONGRESS PASSED AN

510
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN, AFTER A

511
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
SURGE IN GUN VIOLENCE ACROSS THE

512
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
NATION.

513
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
THE LAW BANNED 18 TYPES OF

514
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
RIFLES.

515
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
BUT AFTER TEN YEARS, IT EXPIRED,

516
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
AS THE GUN LOBBY'S POWER HAD
GROWN.

517
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
ACCORDING TO A UNIVERSITY OF

518
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
PENNSYLVANIA STUDY, THE NUMBER

519
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
OF MASS SHOOTINGS DID DECLINE

520
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
DURING THAT DECADE, EXCEPT FOR

521
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
THE YEAR 1999.

522
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
THAT WAS THE YEAR OF COLUMBINE.

523
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
13 STUDENTS AND FACULTY KILLED

524
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
IN A MURDEROUS RAMPAGE.

525
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
SINCE THE BAN ENDED, THE COUNTRY

526
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
HAS SEEN A SPATE OF MASS

527
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
SHOOTINGS.

528
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
INCLUDING THE SPREE IN TUCSON,

529
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
AND THE COLORADO MOVIE THEATER

530
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
MASSACRE, BUT LITTLE IN THE WAY

531
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
OF SIGNIFICANT GUN CONTROL.

532
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
SUPPORTERS OF GUN CONTROL POINT

533
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
TO AUSTRALIA.

534
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
IN 1996, AFTER A MASS SHOOTING

535
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
THERE, THAT COUNTRY BANNED

536
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
CERTAIN TYPES OF RIFLES AND

537
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
LAUNCHED A MASSIVE GUN BUYBACK
CAMPAIGN.

538
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
SINCE THEN, AUSTRALIA HAS NOT

539
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
HAD A SINGLE MASS SHOOTING.

540
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
IS THERE THE WILL OR THE DESIRE

541
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE
U.S.?

542
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
WE DON'T YET KNOW.

543
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
ELIZABETH?

544
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
>> THE NRA HAS BEEN NOTABLY

545
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
SILENT SINCE THE ATTACKS ON
FRIDAY.

546
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
WHAT ABOUT RETAIL STORES?

547
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
SPORTING GOODS STORES THAT SELL

548
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
THESE GUNS?
ANY MOVES?

549
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
ANY ACTIONS OR STATEMENTS FROM

550
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
THEM?

WHAT I'M TELLING YOU IS, WE'RE

914
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
DEALING WITH A POPULATION, THE

915
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
MASS KILLER.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

916
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
DISTINGUISHES THAT PERSON IS,

917
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
ONCE HE DECIDES HE'S GOING TO DO

918
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
IT, HE'S GOING TO DO IT.

919
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
IF YOU CAN KEEP AN ASSAULT RIFLE

920
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
OUT OF HIS HANDS, THE BODY COUNT

921
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
WILL DROP.

922
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
AND THAT'S GREAT.

923
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
BUT THE MASS KILLINGS WILL

924
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN UNLESS

925
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
SYSTEMICALLY WE ADDRESS IT AS A

926
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
SOCIAL PHENOMENON.

927
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
AND RECOGNIZE THERE'S THINGS

928
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
THAT PROMOTE IT.

929
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
FOR EXAMPLE, HIS PICTURE ON OUR

930
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
SCREEN AND US EVEN CARING TO GO

931
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
ALL THE WAY BACK TO FIND OUT

932
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
WHAT HIS GRIEVANCE IS.

933
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A

934
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
MOMENT.

935
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
AND THINGS THAT ENABLE AND

936
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
FACILITATE IS ISOLATING,

937
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
ALIENATING FROM THE WORLD, AND

938
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
KILLING CHILDREN LIKE HE'S IN AN

939
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
ARCADE GAME.

940
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
>> YOU SAY THERE'S NO QUESTION

941
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
THAT THE SEARCH FOR CELEBRITY IS

942
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
PART OF THIS.

943
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
GOING OUT IN A BLAZE OF GLORY.

944
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
YOU'RE ACTUALLY RECOMMENDING NOT

945
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
COVERING THIS AT ALL?

946
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, WORDS ARE

947
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
IMPORTANT.
I THINK CELEBRITY, FOR SOME,

948
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
LIKE A BREIVIK, IN NORWAY.

949
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
HE WANTS CELEBRITY.

950
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
HE TAKES THE PICTURES.

951
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
HE'S READY FOR HIS CLOSE-UP.

952
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
YOU CAN'T SAY THIS ABOUT THIS

953
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
MAN.

954
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
WHAT YOU CAN SAY, WHAT'S THE

955
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
COMMON THREAD OF BOTH?

956
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
IRRELEVANCE.

957
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
WHAT'S THE COMMON THREAD OF THE

958
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
MASS KILLER?
A GRIEVANCE.

959
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
BUT IT'S A GRIEVANCE THAT'S

960
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
THEIR GRIEVANCE.

961
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT LEGITIMATE.

962
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I COULD SAY I HAVE A GRIEVANCE

963
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
WITH YOU.

964
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I COULD JUST CONJURE SOMETHING

965
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
UP BECAUSE I'M RESENTFUL AND

966
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
ALIENATED AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT

967
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
ME FUNNY.

968
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
THAT DOESN'T LEGITIMIZE IT.

969
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
WHAT MASS KILLERS HAVE LEARNED,

970
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
BY WATCHING A STORY SUCH AS

971
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
OURS, SAYING WE'RE GOING TO FIND

972
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
OUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THEIR LIFE.

973
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
WE WANT TO KNOW WHY.

974
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
WHY?
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE, HIS MOTHER

975
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
AND OTHER PEOPLE PAID ATTENTION

976
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
TO HIS GRIEVANCE.
HE HAS IT.

977
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
THE POLICE KNOW IT.

978
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
>> IT'S A SOCIAL PHENOMENON.

979
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
>> MY POINT IS, WHAT HE'S AFTER

980
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
IS LEGITIMACY.

981
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
THEY WANT TO GO FROM IRRELEVANCE

982
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
TO HYPERRELEVANCE.

983
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
>> IS THERE ANY WAY TO TARGET

984
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
THESE MOSTLY YOUNG MEN BEFORE

985
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
THEY KILL?
>> HERE'S THE PATHWAY.

986
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THE PATHWAY IS SOMEONE WHO

987
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
STARTS OUT BLAMING OTHERS,

988
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
RESENTFUL, AND WITHDRAWN.

989
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
AND OVER TIME, BECOME

990
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
INCREASINGLY WITHDRAWN.
AND THEN, INVESTED IN THE IDEA

991
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
OF BLAMING OTHERS.

992
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
SO, IT'S A PERSON WHO BECOMES

993
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
INVESTED IN THE IDEA THAT

994
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
EVERYBODY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

995
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
THEIR SOCIAL AWKWARDNESS, FOR

996
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
HIS SEXUAL INCOMPETENCE, MAN'S

997
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
MAN.

998
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
OKAY?
AND IDENTIFIES WITH DESTRUCTION

999
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
AND THEMES OF DESTRUCTION.

1000
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
IT'S MASCULINITY BECAUSE THAT

1001
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
PERSON HAS FAILED.

1002
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
AND OVER TIME, SEEING STORIES

1003
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
ABOUT MASS KILLERS AND HEARING

1004
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
THE DIALOGUE BEING, WE FAILED.

1005
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
THE END POINT OF THAT IS, PEOPLE

1006
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
DESERVED WHAT THEY GOT.

1007
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
AND WHEN SOMEONE TAPS INTO THAT

1008
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
AND HAS GONE DOWN THAT PATH, AND

1009
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
IT'S A PATH.

1010
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
ONCE THEY'VE GONE DOWN THAT PATH

1011
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
AND THEIR LIFE IS GOING NOWHERE,

1012
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
THEY START TO ENTERTAIN THE IDEA

1013
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
OF ADOPTING THAT AS AN AMBITION.

1014
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, IT'S A

1015
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
TICKING PROCESS.
THEY NEVER STOP.

1016
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
>> WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO

1017
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
BLOCK THAT PATH.
>> THERE IS A WAY.

1018
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
WE HAVE TO ELIMINATE IT.

1019
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT EACH

1020
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
ONE OF US CAN DO.

1021
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000

1022

FIRST OF ALL, WHAT CAN PARENTS

1023
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
DO?

1024
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
TEACH YOUR CHILDREN PERSONAL

1025
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
RESPONSIBILITY.

1026
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
TEACH OUR CHILDREN RESILIENCE

1027
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
BECAUSE TEACH THEM TO UNDERSTAND

1028
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
WHEN THEY FALL DOWN THEY CAN GET

1029
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000

1030
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000

01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
THE IDEA IS TO BRING IN DRIER,

1572

01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,000
>> THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM.

1804
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,000
WE HAVE A STIGMA AROUND

1805
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
CHILDHOOD PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES.

1806
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT.
>> DO YOU THINK PARENTS DON'T

1807
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
SEEK THE HELD?
>> I THINK PARENTS LACK THE

1808
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
INFORMATION.

1809
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
AND WE CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE
WHERE PARENTS CAN BE BLAMED.

1810
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
YOU WATCH A PARENT WATCHING AN

1811
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
OUT-OF-CONTROL CHILD.

1812
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
AND YOU SEE THEM ROLL THEIR
EYES.

1813
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
THAT CHILD MAY HAVE PROBLEMS
THAT WARRANT INTERVENTION.

1814
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
AND ANY PARENT WOULD HAVE A HARD

1815
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
TIME MANAGING.

1816
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
>> NO PARENT WOULD TAKE THAT

1817
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
LONG, TWO YEARS, TO TREAT A

1818
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
PHYSICAL AILMENT.

1819
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I MEAN, THE MINUTE THEY GET

1820
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
A COLD OR A STOMACH BUG, WE HAVE

1821
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
THEM INTO THE DOCTOR.

1822
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
>> RIGHT.
YOU HAVE A RASH, YOU GO TO THE

1823
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
DOCTOR.

1824
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
YOU DON'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT IT
TURNS INTO.

1825
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
WE GO TO THE DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY.

1826
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
WE NEED TO DO THAT WITH

1827
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES, AS WELL.

1828
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
>> WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO

1829
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
RECOGNIZE A CHILD NEEDS TO GO TO

1830
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
THE DOCTOR.

1831
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
YOU AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT

1832
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
THIS A MOMENT AGO.
I BELIEVE IN A MOTHER'S

1833
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
INSTINCT, WE KNOW WHEN

1834
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
SOMETHING'S OFF, NOT QUITE

1835
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
RIGHT.

1836
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
IT'S IMPORTANT WE PAY ATTENTION
TO THOSE INSTINCTS AND NOT BE

1837
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
AFRAID.

1838
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
AND THE FIRST STEP SHOULD BE TO
TAKE THE CHILD TO THE

1839
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
PEDIATRICIAN.

1840
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
>> PARENTS WAIT ABOUT TWO YEARS
ON AVERAGE AFTER THE ONSET OF

1841
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS BEFORE

1842
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
REACHING OUT.

1843
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
SO, THEY HAVE THE GUT INSTINCTS.

1844
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
BUT THEY DON'T ALWAYS FOLLOW-UP

1845
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
ON IT.

1846
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
SO, WE ADVOCATE FOR PARENTS TO

1847
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
GO TO THE PEDIATRICIAN AND TALK

1848
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
TO THE PEDIATRICIANS ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

1849
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
>> WHAT ARE THE WARNING SIGNS

1850
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
THAT SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS MAY

1851
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
BE GOING ON WITH YOUR CHILD?

1852
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
>> YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR CHRONIC

1853
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
IRRITABILITY AND UNHAPPINESS.

1854
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR SOCIAL
LONER.

1855
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
SOCIAL ISOLATION.

1856
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
NOT HAVING MANY FRIENDS OR ANY

1857
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
MEANINGFUL FRIENDSHIPS.

1858
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
BEING ARGUMENTATIVE AND

1859
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
OPPOSITIONAL.

1860
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR

1861
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
ANTI-SOCIAL ACTS, LIKE STEALING

1862
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
OR BEING MEAN TO KIDS.

1863
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
>> ALL THOSE SYMPTOMS YOU

1864
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
DESCRIBED COULD BE FOUND IN ANY
CHILD, ANY NORMAL CHILD.

1865
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1866
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
THEY CAN.

1867
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
SO, WHAT WE WANT TO LOOK FOR IS

1868
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
SOMETHING WE CALL FUNCTIONAL

1869
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
IMPAIRMENT.

1870
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
WHERE KIDS' JOBS ARE BEING

1871
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
COMPROMISED.

1872
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
A KID'S JOB IS TO GO TO SCHOOL

1873
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
AND LEARN AND TO CONCENTRATE.

1874
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
AND A KID'S JOB IS TO MAKE AND

1875
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
KEEP FRIENDS.

1876
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THOSE

1877
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
TWO IMPORTANT THINGS BECAUSE

1878
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
SYMPTOMS ARE GETTING IN THE WAY,

1879
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
WE WANT TO REACH OUT AND GET
HELP.

1880
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THERE'S A

1881
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
LACK OF RESOURCES FOR SO MANY

1882
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
FAMILIES?
I'VE DONE SO MUCH REPORTING OVER

1883
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
THE YEARS.

1884
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
WE JUST SAW IN THAT PIECE JUST

1885
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
NOW WE HAD ON "20/20," SHOWING

1886
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
FAMILIES DESPERATE FOR HELP.

1887
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
BUT THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT.

1888
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
INSURANCE DOESN'T COVER IT.

1889
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
OR A HOSPITAL DOESN'T HAVE A BED

1890
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
FOR A CHILD.

1891
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
>> WE WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR

1892
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
PARENTS TO GET CONNECTED TO THE

1893
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
RESOURCES THEY NEED.

1894
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS ARE COMMON

1895
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,000
AND TREATABLE.
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF RESOURCES

1896
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000

1897
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000

AGO.

2316
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000

YOU KNOW?
WE HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME

2318
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000

01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
AND THEN, IN THE END, IT GETS

2341
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
BETTER AGAIN.

2342
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
BUT IT'S AN INTERESTING TIME.

2343
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
>> AND AT THE HANDS OF YOUR

2344
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
HUSBAND, IT'S VERY, VERY FUNNY.

2345
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
LET'S SHOW EVERYBODY A CLIP.

2346
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
TAKE A LOOK.

2347
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
>> YOU NEED TO GET OUTSIDE MORE.

2348
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
DO SOME PLAYING OUTSIDE.

2349
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
>> YEAH.

2350
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,000
YOU CAN BUILD THINGS.
YOU CAN BUILD A FORT OUTSIDE.

2351
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
>> WHAT?

2352
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
>> YEAH, BUILD A FORT.

2353
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

2354
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
>> MAKE A FORT OUTSIDE?

2355
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
AND DO WHAT?

2356
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
DO WHAT IN A FORT?

2357
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:29,000
>> WHEN I WAS A KID, WE USED TO

2358
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,000
BUILD TREE HOUSES AND PLAY WITH

2359
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
STICKS.
>> NOBODY PLAYS WITH STICKS.

2360
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
>> YOU CAN HAVE A LEMONADE

2361
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
STAND.
>> PLAY KICK THE CAN.

2362
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
>> LOOK FOR BED BODIES.

2363
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
>> THAT'S FUN TO DO.

2364
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
>> GET A TIRE AND RUN DOWN THE

2365
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
STREET WITH IT.

2366
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
>> IT'S 2012.

2367
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
>> YOU DON'T NEED TECHNOLOGY.

2368
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
>> NO TECHNOLOGY.

2369
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
>> CHARLOTTE, PUT THAT DOWN.

2370
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
>> SO FUNNY.

2371
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
THOSE ARE YOUR REAL DAUGHTERS.

2372
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
AND DAD WAS BOSS, JUDD APATOW.

2373
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
DO THEY LISTEN TO HIM ON THE

2374
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
SET?

2375
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
>> THEY DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

2376
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
THEY DON'T.
HE THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BECAUSE

2377
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
HE'S THE DIRECTOR.

2378
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
BUT NO.

2379
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
THEY COULD CARELE LESS WHAT HE S

2380
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
TO SAY.
IF THEY GET TIRED, THEY JUST

2381
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
TAKE NAPS.
THEY'RE AWFUL TO DEAL WITH.

2382
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
BUT THEY'RE REALLY GOOD IN THE

2383
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
MOVIE.

2384
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000

THE OUTTAKES.

2389
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
>> SHE'S SO GREAT.

2390
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
SHE'S HILARIOUS.

2391
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
>> SO ARE YOU.

2392
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
THE MOVIE IS "THIS IS 40."

2393
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
IT'S IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY.

2394

MAYBE JOSH WILL GO.
HE TALKS THROUGH ALL THE MOVIES.

2399
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
>> THAT'S -- TRUE.

2400
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT MOVIE.

SO MANY OF US ARE WORRIED ABOUT

2448
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
THE SECRETS ON WHAT TO AVOID AND

2449
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
WHAT TO GO FOR.

2450

JOLLY, IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE

2453
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
TO GAIN WEIGHT, TOO.

2454
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I HAVE HOLIDAY TRADITIONS TO

2455
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
KEEP FROM PACKING ON THE POUNDS.

2456
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000

I DRINK LOTS OF WATER TO FILL UP

2459
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
AND HYDRATE.
ONCE THE PARTY STARTS, I PLAN TO

2460

ENJOY IT.

2461
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
BUT IT TAKES MORE THAN THAT TO

2462
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
MAKE GOOD CHOICES.

2463
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
