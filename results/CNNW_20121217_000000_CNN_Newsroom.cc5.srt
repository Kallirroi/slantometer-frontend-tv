1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO KNOW

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
TOMORROW.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
THAT'S JUST THE WORLD WE LIVE IN

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA OBVIOUSLY,

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
JUST TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
TOUGH CONVERSATIONS, WOLF.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I THINK I HAVE HAD SOME OF THOSE

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
ALREADY WITH MY OWN KIDS.

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THESE THINGS

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE

12
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION BE AS

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE.

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I THINK SOME OF THE IMPORTANT

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
TIPS ARE TO ALLOW -- FIRST OF

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
ALL, I ALWAYS SAY CHECK YOUR OWN

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
PULSE BEFORE YOU GO INTO A

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
MEDICAL SITUATION.
HERE YOU CHECK YOUR OWN

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
FEELINGS.
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
OVER TALKING THE CHILD, BUT ALSO

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
MAKING SURE YOU LISTEN TO THEM

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
FIRST.
SEE WHAT THEY KNOW AND THEN

23
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
SLOWLY START TO FILL IN DETAILS.

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

25
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
THESE ARE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
ARE HAPPENING FRANKLY ALL OVER

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
THE COUNTRY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

28
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
DAYS.
>> AS WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW, THE

29
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
PRESIDENT IS STILL COMFORTING

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
PEOPLE, SOME OF THE FAMILY

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
MEMBERS WHO HAVE SUFFERED SO

32
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
MUCH.

33
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW THOSE

34
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING.

35
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
WHAT DOES EVEN THE PRESIDENT SAY

36
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
TO A MOTHER AND A FATHER WHO

37
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
LOST A 6-YEAR-OLD?

38
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
>> YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

39
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THOSE

40
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
CONVERSATIONS ARE LIKE.

41
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I THINK SIMPLY BEING THERE,

42
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
SIMPLY SHOWING THE SUPPORT,

43
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
SIMPLY AGAIN HAVING PEOPLE COME

44
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
TOGETHER.
YOU KNOW, I THINK SUFFERING IN

45
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
SILENCE, SUFFERING IN ISOLATION,

46
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
YOU KNOW, DEALING WITH THIS

47
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
ANGUISH I THINK PROBABLY MAKES

48
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
IT THAT MUCH HARDER.

49
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
SO I THINK THAT HE CAN HELP

50
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
WITH.

51
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
>> LET ME RESET WHAT'S GOING ON

52
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
RIGHT NOW, AND I WANT TO WELCOME

53
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
OUR VIEWERS NOT ONLY HERE IN THE

54
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
UNITED STATES BUT AROUND THE

55
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
WORLD.
WE'RE STANDING BY FOR THE START

56
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
OF THIS PRAYER VIGIL, THIS

57
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
INTERFAITH PRAYER VIGIL THAT

58
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
WILL TAKE PLACE HERE AT THE

59
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
NEWTOWN HIGH SCHOOL.

60
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
YOU SEE THE FOLKS ARE GATHERING.

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO COMFORT EACH

62
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
OTHER.
WE'RE WATCHING WHAT'S GOING ON

63
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

64
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
STATES.
HE HAS ARRIVED HERE.

65
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
HE FLEW FROM THE WHITE HOUSE,

66
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
FROM ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE

67
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
OUTSIDE OF THE WHITE HOUSE IN

68
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
SUBURBAN MARYLAND, FLEW TO

69
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
HARTFORD AND THEN DROVE.

70
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
THE WEATHER HERE IS NOT GOOD

71
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
RIGHT NOW, SO HE COULD NOT

72
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
CHOPPER -- COULD NOT COME OVER

73
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
BY MARINE ONE.
HAD TO DRIVE FROM HARTFORD, AN

74
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
HOUR, HOUR AND A HALF DRIVE FROM

75
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
HERE, AND WE'RE IN NEWTOWN

76
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
WATCHING WHAT'S GOING ON.

77
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
ALL OF THESE MAKESHIFT MEMORIALS

78
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
HAVE JUST SPRUNG UP.

79
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
YOU CAN'T -- YOU CAN VIRTUALLY

80
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
NOT EVEN DRIVE THROUGH THE SMALL

81
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
STREETS OF NEWTOWN RIGHT NOW

82
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
IT'S SO, CROSO CROWDED.

83
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
PEOPLE ARE BRINGING CANDLES,

84
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
FLOWERS, CANDLES, TEDDY BEARS,

85
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
LEGOS.
WE'RE GETTING READY FOR WHAT

86
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
WILL BE A VERY, VERY EMOTIONAL

87
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
MEMORIAL SERVICE.
I'M WOLF BLITZER REPORTING HERE

88
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
FROM NEWTOWN.

89
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
ANDERSON COOPER IS RIGHT DOWN

90
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
THE STREET.
HE'S NEAR THE HIGH SCHOOL.

91
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
HE'S JOINING US AS WELL.

92
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
ANDERSON?

93
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, WOLF.

94
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'M ACTUALLY RIGHT RIGHT OUTSIDE

95
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
THE HIGH SCHOOL.
YOU SEE THE INSIDE OF THE

96
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
AUDITORIUM THERE AND REALLY FULL

97
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
TO CAPACITY.

98
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL OUTSIDE

99
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
LOOKING LIKE THEY'RE LETTING

100
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
SOME MORE PEOPLE IN.

101
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'M NOT SURE WHAT PART OF THE

102
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
HIGH SCHOOL THEY'LL BE IN.

103
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
THEY'LL PROBABLY HAVE SOME

104
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
OVERFLOW ROOMS AVAILABLE.

105
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENT

106
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
IS ALREADY INSIDE THE HIGH

107
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
SCHOOL, HAS BEEN MEETING WITH
THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO HAVE

108
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
LOST LOVED ONES AND TRYING TO

109
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
OFFER THEM SOME COMFORT AND

110
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
LISTEN AS MUCH AS TALK, I'M

111
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
SURE, IN CASES LIKE THIS.

112
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
OFTEN JUST LISTENING TO PARENTS

113
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
TALK ABOUT THEIR CHILD, ABOUT

114
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
WHAT THEIR CHILD WAS LIKE,

115
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
SHARING STORIES AND SHARING IN

116
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
THAT GRIEF.

117
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
OUR JESSICA YELLIN, OUR CHIEF

118
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT IS

119
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
ALSO HERE WITH ME.
DO WE KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS

120
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
GOING TO BE SAYING TONIGHT?

121
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
>> I'M TOLD THAT HE'LL TALK

122
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
ABOUT THE NATION'S OBLIGATIONS

123
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
TO OUR CHILDREN.
THEY'RE NOT GETTING MORE

124
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
SPECIFIC THAN THAT, BUT I THINK

125
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
THAT THAT MEANS BOTH AS

126
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
FAMILIES, AS PARENTS, AND, YOU

127
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
KNOW, PERSONALLY TO CONNECT WITH

128
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
YOUR LOVED ONES, AND PROBABLY

129
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
MAYBE A BROAD REFERENCE TO OUR

130
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
OBLIGATIONS TO TAKE ACTION.

131
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

132
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
PRESIDENT REALLY MEANS BY THAT.

133
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
IS IT SOME SORT OF POLITICAL

134
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
ACTION.

135
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, IN THESE

136
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
SPEECHES, THE PRESIDENT IS VERY

137
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
GOOD, ANDERSON, ABOUT FINDING

138
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
MOMENTS OF HEROISM TO TALK ABOUT

139
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
RESILIENCE AND THE AMERICAN

140
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
SPIRIT AND MOMENTS THAT SORT OF

141
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
CONNECT US TO WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT

142
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
OUR SPIRIT.

143
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
AND SO THAT WE FIND SOMETHING

144
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
POSITIVE IN ALL OF THIS.

145
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
>> AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY MANY

146
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
MOMENTS THAT WE KNOW OF ALREADY

147
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
FROM WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT

148
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
SCHOOL ON THAT DAY, TEACHERS

149
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
LIKE VICTORIA SOTO WHO

150
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
ESSENTIALLY SEEMED TO HAVE

151
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
SACRIFICED HER LIFE IN ORDER TO

152
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
PROTECT HER STUDENTS, TELLING

153
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
THE GUNMAN THAT THE STUDENTS

154
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
WERE NOT IN THE CLASSROOM WHEN

155
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
SHE HAD HIDDEN THEM.

156
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
AND I HAVE TALKED TO TEACHERS

157
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
WHO WERE, YOU KNOW, LITERALLY --

158
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
THEY KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING

159
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
ON, DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS, AND

160
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THEY SAT THEIR KIDS DOWN, GOT

161
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
THEM IN THE CORNER AND READ TO

162
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
THEM ALL DURING THE SHOOTING AND

163
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
JUST TRYING TO KEEP THEIR KIDS

164
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
CALM AND KEEP THEM -- THEIR

165
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
MINDS DIVERTED UNTIL A S.W.A.T.

166
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
TEAM ARRIVED.

167
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
>> THAT'S WHY IT'S JUST SUCH A

168
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
CHILLING STORY, A CHILLING

169
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE THESE WERE

170
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
YOUNG CHILDREN, AND I THINK

171
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS AN

172
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
OBLIGATION AND HE KNOWS THE

173
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
CHALLENGE TO CONNECT WITH.

174
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
THE SENSE THIS WAS A COMMUNITY

175
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
THAT DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

176
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
LOOK AT WHAT THE SCHOOL DID WITH

177
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
SECURITY THEY PUT IN PLACE, WITH

178
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
HOW DEVOTED THESE TEACHERS WERE.

179
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I MEAN, TWO THREW THEMSELVES AT

180
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
THE GUNMAN TO BLOCK THEIR WAY

181
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
AND IT HAPPENED TO THEM, AND

182
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
IT'S AN INSTANCE WHERE YOU

183
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
HAVE -- IT'S SO SENSELESS.

184
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
THERE'S NO WAY TO EXPLAIN EVEN

185
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
WHEN THE POLICE UNCOVER THE

186
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
MOTIVE.

187
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THERE'S NO WAY TO EXPLAIN WHY

188
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
THIS HAD TO HAPPEN.

189
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
>> AND PRESIDENT OBAMA SPEAKING

190
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
AS A FATHER TONIGHT AS MUCH AS

191
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
AS THE PRESIDENT, AS A FATHER

192
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
WHO NO DOUBT HAD TO EXPLAIN TO

193
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
HIS OWN CHILDREN WHAT HAPPENED.

194
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
>> IT'S SUCH A GOOD POINT, AND,

195
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
YOU KNOW, WHEN -- THE TIMES WE

196
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
SEE HIM GET EMOTIONAL, IT IS

197
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
WHEN HE'S TALKING ABOUT SASHA

198
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
AND MALIA, AND IT'S INTERESTING,

199
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
THE MOMENT HE CHOKED UP ON

200
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
FRIDAY WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING

201
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
ABOUT THIS TRAGEDY WAS WHEN HE

202
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
SAID, THESE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN,

203
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
THESE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN, THAT'S

204
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
WHEN HE STARTED TO CRY.

205
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
AND, YOU KNOW, I HAVE SAID IT

206
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
BEFORE, BUT THAT WAS THE MOST

207
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
EMOTIONAL I HAVE EVER SEEN HIM

208
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
IN PUBLIC, AND IT WAS A POWERFUL

209
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
MOMENT FOR THE NATION OF RELEASE

210
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
FOR THE WHOLE NATION AND A WAY

211
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
FOR EVERYBODY TO EXPRESS GRIEF.

212
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
HE WENT TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S

213
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
DANCE REHEARSAL TODAY.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS PLANNING

214
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
TO ANYWAY, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S

215
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
SORT OF -- I WONDER IF HE JUST

216
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
WANTED TO SPEND TIME WITH HIS

217
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
KIDS.
>> DO WE KNOW IS THE FIRST LADY

218
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
WITH HIM?
>> SHE'S NOT.

219
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
>> SHE'S NOT.

220
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
>> SHE'S NOT.

221
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
HIS FAMILY IS HOME TONIGHT, BUT

222
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
HE DID GET TO SPEND SOME TIME

223
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
WITH THE GIRLS TODAY.

224
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
>> HE IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY

225
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
SPEAKERS WHO WILL BE TALKING

226
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
DURING THIS SERVICE.

227
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WAS TO BEGIN AT 7:00 EAST COAST

228
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
TIME.
IT NOW SEEMS LIKE IT MAY BE

229
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
DELAYED SOMEWHAT.

230
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
WE'RE NOT SURE IF THAT'S BECAUSE

231
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THE PRESIDENT IS CONTINUING TO

232
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
MEET WITH FAMILIES OR WHAT THE

233
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
REASON FOR THE DELAY IS, BUT

234
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
OBVIOUSLY WE WILL BRING YOU THE

235
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
SERVICE IN ITS ENTIRETY WHEN IT

236
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
BEGINS, AND YOU'RE SEEING THE

237
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
INSIDE OF THE AUDITORIUM RIGHT

238
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
NOW.
SUPPOSED TO LAST ABOUT TWO

239
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
HOURS, SO IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE

240
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
A LENGTHY SERVICE.

241
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THERE'S A NUMBER OF SPEAKERS, A

242
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
NUMBER OF READINGS FROM VARIOUS

243
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
RELIGIOUS TEXTS.

244
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
THERE WILL BE SOME AUDIENCE

245
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
PARTICIPATION IN THOSE READINGS

246
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
AS WELL.

247
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I SEE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO IT

248
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
LOOKS LIKE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT

249
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
THERE'S NO MORE ROOM, SO IT

250
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
LOOKS LIKE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE

251
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
ARE LEAVING THIS HIGH SCHOOL.

252
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
WE'VE BEEN SEEING PEOPLE COME,

253
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
BUT EVEN AS WE SEE PEOPLE

254
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
LEAVING, WE SEE MORE PEOPLE

255
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
ARRIVING, MORE FAMILIES ARRIVI G

256
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
ARRIVING, EVEN BRINGING THEIR

257
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
LITTLE CHILDREN HOPING TO GET

258
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
INSIDE, BUT THERE ARE MANY

259
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
PLACES THROUGHOUT THIS TOWN

260
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
WHERE PEOPLE CAN PARTICIPATE IN

261
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
A SENSE AND CAN FEEL AS IF THEY

262
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
ARE ALL PART OF THIS.

263
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
WE'VE BEEN SEEING ONE OF THE

264
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
MAKESHIFT MEMORIALS DON LEMON IS

265
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
AT A FEW PLBLOCKS FROM THE HIGH

266
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
SCHOOL.
I SAW SOMEONE BRING 26 BALLOONS

267
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
AND TIE THEM DOWN AT A MEMORIAL.

268
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
PEOPLE BRINGING WHATEVER THEY

269
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
CAN, LITTLE ME MENTOS THEY FEEL

270
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
ARE IMPORTANT.
THEY JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT

271
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
AND PAUSE AND REMEMBER.

272
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
WOLF?

273
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
>> YOU KNOW, ANDERSON, SORT OF A

274
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
VERY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCE

275
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
INDEED, AND IT REMINDS ME IN THE

276
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
AFTERMATH OF THE OKLAHOMA CITY

277
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
BOMBING WHEN PRESIDENT CLINTON

278
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
WENT OUT TO OKLAHOMA CITY AND

279
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
DELIVERED A REALLY BEAUTIFUL,

280
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
POWERFUL ADDRESS THAT NOT ONLY

281
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
THE PEOPLE IN OKLAHOMA CITY, BUT

282
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND,

283
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
INDEED, THE WORLD, AN ADDRESS

284
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
THAT RESONATED.

285
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE KEY MOMENTS

286
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
FOR THIS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

287
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
STATES TO DO THE SAME THING AND

288
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
AS JESSICA HAS BEEN REPORTING

289
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
AND AS WE'VE HEARD THE PRESIDENT

290
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
PERSONALLY GOT INVOLVED.

291
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
HE'S AN EXCELLENT WRITER, AND HE

292
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
HAS WORKED HARD IN MAKING SURE

293
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
THAT THE WORDS HE WILL SAY

294
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
TONIGHT WILL HE BELIEVES

295
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
HOPEFULLY RESONATE NOT ONLY WITH

296
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
THE FOLKS OUT THERE, PEOPLE
WATCHING HERE IN THE UNITED

297
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD, BUT

298
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
MOST IMPORTANTLY MAYBE BRING A

299
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
LITTLE BIT OF COMFORT, A LITTLE

300
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
BIT OF COMFORT, AND GOD KNOWS

301
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH

302
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
HELL RIGHT NOW, THE FAMILIES OF

303
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
THOSE WHO DIED, THE 26 PEOPLE

304
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
WHO WERE KI8D LLED SO BRUTALLY

305
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
FRIDAY MORNING.

306
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
SANJAY IS HERE AS WP.

307
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
SANJAY, THIS IS A CHALLENGE FOR

308
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THIS PRESIDENT.

309
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
HE'S BEEN RE-ELECTED.

310
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
HE'S GOT FOUR YEARS AHEAD OF

311
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
HIM, BUT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

312
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
SEMINAL MOMENTS THAT HISTORIANS

313
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
IN THE FUTURE WILL LOOK BACK AT

314
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
THIS SPEECH AND SAY, THIS WAS A

315
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
MOMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT

316
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
STEPPED UP.

317
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
>> THAT COMFORTER-IN-CHIEF IS

318
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
TERMINOLOGY THAT'S BEEN USED.

319
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
IT'S A QUESTION OF RIGHT NOW

320
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
HE'S MEETING WITH THESE PARENTS,

321
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
AS YOU MENTIONED, WOLF.

322
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
HE'S WORKING ON THESE REMARKS

323
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
HIMSELF.

324
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
MY GUESS IS HAVING WORKED IN

325
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
THAT CAPACITY IN A WHITE HOUSE

326
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
BEFORE, YOU KNOW, HIS REMARKS

327
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
MAY CHANGE EVEN AFTER HE MEETS

328
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
WITH THESE PARENTS AND IS SO

329
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
AFFECTED AND TOUCHED BY WHAT

330
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
HE'S HEARING FROM THEM.

331
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
SO I THINK THAT THE SORT OF --

332
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
WHAT WE HEAR FROM HIM I THINK IS

333
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
VERY MUCH GOING TO REFLECT THAT.

334
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
HE'S STILL MEETING WITH THEM

335
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
NOW, AS YOU POINT OUT.

336
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO START

337
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
AROUND 7:00, BUT HE DOES NOT

338
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
WANT TO BE RUSHED.
HE WANTS TO HAVE THAT TIME TO

339
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
MEET WITH THESE FAMILIES.

340
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS SAYING,

341
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
AND I DON'T KNOW, AS YOU SAID

342
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
EARLIER, WHAT HE COULD POSSIBLY

343
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
SAY, BUT THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING

344
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
RIGHT NOW.
>> WE SAW THOSE 26 GLASSES

345
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
THERE, MEMORIAL TO THE 26 WHO

346
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
WERE SO BRUTALLY ASSAULTED AND

347
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
KILLED FRIDAY MORNING.

348
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
20 CHILDREN AGES 6 AND 7, ALL

349
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
FIRST GRADERS, AND SIX TEACHERS,

350
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
SIX TEACHERS, ALL WOMEN, FOR NO

351
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
REASON, NO REASON AT ALL.

352
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT

353
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
HAPPENED, AND NOW WE'LL HEAR

354
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
FROM REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE

355
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
MAJOR FAITHS HERE IN THE UNITED

356
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
STATES AND THEY'RE GEARING UP.

357
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
WE'LL HAVE MUSIC AND WE'LL HAVE

358
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
POWERFUL WORDS.

359
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
REVEREND MATTHEW KREBIN, THE

360
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
SENIOR MINISTER OF THE NEWTOWN

361
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
CONGRESSIONAL CHURCH, UNITED

362
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
CHURCH OF CHRIST, HE WILL OPEN

363
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
UP.

364
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET

365
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
WITH HIM AT HIS CHURCH YESTERDAY

366
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
AND YOU SEE SOME OF THE CLERGY

367
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
THERE, INCLUDING THE RABBI WHO

368
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
IS THERE AS WELL.

369
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
YOU SEE HIM WEARING THE SKULL

370
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
CAP WITH HIS BACK TO US.

371
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
HE AND REVEREND KREBBIN, THEY

372
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
WERE BOTH INSIDE THE FIRE HALL

373
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
WHERE ALL THE FAMILIES GATHERED,

374
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
THE GOVERNOR WAS THERE, DANNEL

375
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
MALLOY, AND AT ONE POINT THE

376
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
GOVERNOR STARTED TELLING FAMILY

377
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
MEMBERS, PARENTS, WHO WAS ALIVE

378
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
AND WHO WASN'T ALIVE, AND, YOU

379
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
KNOW, AND BOTH THE MINISTER AND

380
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
THE RABBI SAID TO ME, IT WAS

381
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
ONE -- IT WAS THE MOST POWERFUL

382
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
MOMENT, THE SHOCK, AND THESE ARE

383
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
CLERGY, THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO

384
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
COMFORT.

385
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

386
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
>> THESE PARENTS, THEY DID NOT

387
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
KNOW, THEY WERE WAITING, HOPING,

388
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
SEEING CHILDREN COME OUT AND

389
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
HOPING THAT ONE OF THOSE

390
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
CHILDREN WOULD BE THEIRS, BUT

391
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
FOR SO MANY PARENTS THAT DIDN'T

392
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
HAPPEN, AND THE GOVERNOR WAS THE

393
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
ONE, YOU HEARD THIS MORNING,

394
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
WOLF, THAT ULTIMATELY TOLD THEM,

395
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
CONVEYED THAT INFORMATION, THAT
HORRIBLE INFORMATION TO THEM.

396
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
>> HE FELT IT WAS HIS

397
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
RESPONSIBILITY, GOVERNOR MALLOY,

398
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
HIS RESPONSIBILITY AS THE

399
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF

400
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
CONNECTICUT TO DELIVER THIS

401
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
HORRENDOUS NEWS.
NO NEWS COULD BE WORSE.

402
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
CHILDREN BURY PARENTS.

403
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
PARENTS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BURY

404
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
THEIR CHILDREN, AND THIS IS AN

405
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY THAT HAS

406
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
AFFLICTED -- THAT HAS IMPACTED

407
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
THIS SMALL OPPORTUNITY.

408
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
UNDER 30,000 PEOPLE LIVE HERE IN

409
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
NEWTOWN, AND, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE

410
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
ALL GATHERED HERE.

411
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
YOU SEE REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL

412
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
THE FAITHS WHO HAVE COME TO

413
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
REMEMBER, TO REFLECT, AND THEY

414
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
HOPE BRING SOME COMFORT TO THOSE

415
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
WHO ARE IN MOURNING.

416
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW I

417
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
WOULD BEHAVE, WOLF.

418
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'M SURE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU

419
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
WOULD EITHER IN A SITUATION LIKE

420
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
THIS.

421
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I HAVE BEEN PRETTY AMAZED AT HOW

422
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
QUICKLY PEOPLE HAVE COME

423
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
TOGETHER.
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ROBBIE

424
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
PARKER, THIS 30-YEAR-OLD

425
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT WHO LOST

426
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
HIS DAUGHTER EMILIE, I WAS,

427
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
AGAIN, AS I THINK SO MANY PEOPLE

428
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
WERE, STUNNED AND BLOWN AWAY BY

429
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
HOW FORGIVING HE WAS, HOW

430
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
COMPASSIONATE HE WAS, AND HOW --

431
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I MEAN ACCEPT EPPSANCE IS PROBA

432
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
THE WRONG WORD BUT HE HAD

433
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
DEVELOPED A PLAN TO FORGIVE AND

434
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
TURN THIS TRAGEDY INTO SOMETHING

435
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
THAT COULD BE OF COMFORT TO

436
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
FAMILIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

437
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
THAT MAY GO THROUGH SOMETHING

438
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
LIKE THIS, THE LOSS OF A CHILD,

439
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
WOLF.

440
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
>> YEAH.
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAT ANY

441
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
PARENT, ANYONE COULD ENDURE THAN

442
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
LOSING A CHILD, AND WHEN WE SEE

443
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
THE PICTURES OF THESE LITTLE

444
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
SEE THEIR NAMES, WE

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
APPRECIATE -- I DON'T KNOW IF WE

447
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
COULD EVER APPRECIATE, BUT YOU

448
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
BEGIN TO SENSE THE ENORMITY OF

449
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
THE PAIN THESE PARENTS AND THEIR

450
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000

A SMILE -- LISTEN, I HAVEN'T

512
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
REALLY SEEN ANYONE SMILING OUT

513
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
HERE AND THESE DOGS SHOWED UP

514
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
AND THE KIDS STARTED SMILING.

515
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
THIS IS MARE MOM, KATHY.

516
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
WHEN YOUR KIDS SAW THE DOGS,

517
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
WHAT HAPPENED?

518
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
>> THEY LIT UP.

519
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
THEY LIT UP INSIDE AND THEY WERE

520
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
EVEN MORE EXCITED TO HEAR THAT

521
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
THEY WERE HERE TO SPREAD COMFORT

522
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
AND WE'RE RELIGIOUS, AND WE

523
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
BELIEVE THAT HAVING A SENSE OF

524
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
GOD BEING AROUND US BRINGS THAT

525
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
KIND OF COMFORT.

526
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
SO IT'S REALLY EXCITING THAT

527
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
PEOPLE CAME FROM CHICAGO.

528
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
>> Reporter: SHOW THE DOGS.

WITH THE BLINKING LIGHTS.

536
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
WE JUST -- WE FELT LIKE IT WAS

537
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T

538
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
REALLY ANY GOOD WORDS TO FIX

539
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
PEOPLE'S GRIEF, THAT IF THEY SAW

540
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
AN ACTION, THAT PEOPLE LOVED

541
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
THEM ENOUGH TO COME AND WALK AND

542
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
REMEMBER THEIR CHILDREN THAT IT

543
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
WOULD HELP.

544
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
>> Reporter: THE SIGN SAYS WE

545
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
ARE HOLDING YOU CLOSE FROM

546
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000

YOU LOOK AT, WOLF, YOU KNOW, THE

548
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
DOGS THAT CAN BRING A SMILE TO
THE FACE OF CHILDREN AND REALLY

549
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
TO EVERYONE, AND WHEN THESE DOGS

550
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
SHOWED UP HERE, EVERYONE STARTED

551
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
TO FLOCK AROUND THESE DOGS.
THEY STARTED TO PET THEM AND

552
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
THEY STARTED TO SMILE.

553
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
AND IT'S JUST ONE OF THE WAYS

554
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
HERE THAT PEOPLE ARE COMING

555
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
TOGETHER TO HELP THIS COMMUNITY

556
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
NOT ONLY FROM THE AREA BUT

557
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
REALLY FROM ALL OVER THE

558
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
COUNTRY.

559
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
YOU PUT SMILES ON PEOPLE'S

560
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
FACES.
DOES THAT MAKE YOU SMILE?

561
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
>> WE BRING MERCY AND COMPASSION

562
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
AND HELP PEOPLE TO DEAL.

563
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
>> Reporter: YOU COULDN'T HELP
YOURSELF WHEN YOU SAW WHAT

564
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
HAPPENED HERE?
>> WEE SEE THIS ALL THE TIME.

565
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
IF IT HELPS PEOPLE, THAT'S WHAT

566
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
WE'RE ABOUT.

567
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
>> Reporter: GO TOWARDS THE

568
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
DOGS.

569
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
YOU SEE EVERYONE HERE WALKING UP

570
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
AND THESE DOGS HAVE BECOME THE

571
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
CENTER OF ATTENTION.

572
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IT DOES --

573
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
AND THEY'RE ALL AROUND THE

574
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
MEMORIAL OVER HERE.
IT DOES WARM MY HEART TO SEE

575
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
THIS BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS BEEN

576
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
SO SAD HERE, AND AS I SAID

577
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
YESTERDAY, I WAS TALKING TO

578
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
ANDERSON I BELIEVE, THAT I

579
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
HAVEN'T SEEN FACES LIKE THIS,

580
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
PEOPLE WHO SORT OF HAVE BLANK

581
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
LOOKS ON THEIR FACES SINCE I SAW

582
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
THE RESCUERS, QUITE FRANKLY,

583
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
DOWN AT 9/11, AND THEN THESE

584
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
DOGS REALLY ARE HELPING.

585
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
>> YES.

586
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
>> Reporter: I WISH THERE WERE

587
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
MORE.
>> A FEW WEEKS AGO WE WERE IN

588
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
NEW YORK CITY WITH THE DOGS AND

589
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
HELPING PEOPLE THERE AND THEN IN

590
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
NEW JERSEY, SAME THING.

591
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
WALKING THEM WITH CHILDREN.

592
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
>> Reporter: HOW MANY OTHER

593
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
ORGANIZATIONS ARE YOU AWARE OF

594
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT DOES

595
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
THIS?
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY THAT HAS

596
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
ORGANIZED PROGRAM THAT DOES

597
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
THIS.
>> Reporter: THE KIDS OVER HERE.

598
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
YOU SAID YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF

599
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
WHAT?
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY THAT

600
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
DOES THIS, THAT BREEDS AND

601
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
TRAINS THEIR DOGS AND PLACES

602
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
THEM IN CHURCHES TO DO THIS.

603
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
THEY'RE AT NURSING HOMES,

604
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
HOSPITALS, WHEREVER, BUT

605
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
PARTICULARLY IN SITUATIONS LIKE

606
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
THIS WHERE YOU HAVE A TRAGEDY.

607
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
>> Reporter: YEAH.

608
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
WOLF, YOU KNOW, ONE MOMENT OF

609
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
JUST A LITTLE COMFORT HERE TO

610
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED SO

611
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
MUCH COMFORT AND SO MUCH HELP

612
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
AND JUST A DOG, A COUPLE DOGS

613
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
ARE ABLE TO DO IT.
I WISH THERE WERE MORE.

614
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I WISH THERE WAS MORE WE COULD

615
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
DO FOR THE FOLKS HERE, BUT THIS

616
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
AT THE MOMENT, THIS IS AT LEAST

617
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
A LITTLE BIT.

618
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
>> YOU KNOW, THOSE DOGS, I'M

619
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
SURE, ARE VERY COMFORTING TO

620
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

621
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
THERE, DON.
THOSE ARE REALLY MOVING REPORTS

622
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
YOU'RE BRINGING US, AND WE'RE

623
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
GOING TO COME BACK TO YOU AS WE

624
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
AWAIT THE PRESIDENT OF THE

625
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
UNITED STATES, THE CLERGY,

626
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
THEY'RE GETTING READY FOR THIS

627
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
INTERFAITH MEMORIAL SERVICE.

628
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
WE'LL HEAR MUSIC, WE'LL HEAR

629
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
PRAYERS, WE'LL HEAR PASSAGES

630
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
FROM THE PSALMS AND WE'LL HEAR

631
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
FROM THE GOVERNOR OF

632
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
CONNECTICUT.
WE'LL ALSO HEAR FROM THE

633
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

634
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
THIS WILL BE A VERY, VERY MOVING

635
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
SERVICE, AND WE CAN ONLY HOPE

636
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
AND PRAY THAT IT WILL BRING SOME

637
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
COMFORT TO THOSE WHO ARE IN

638
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
MOURNING RIGHT NOW.

639
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
ANDERSON COOPER IS WATCHING

640
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
WHAT'S GOING ON AS WELL.

641
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
ANDERSON?
>> YEAH, WOLF.

642
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
WE'RE OUTSIDE THE HIGH SCHOOL

643
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
WHERE THIS SERVICE IS GOING TO

644
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
TAKE PLACE.

645
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'M WITH DONNA MORRISSEY FROM

646
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
THE AMERICAN RED CROSS.

647
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
YOU HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE FRIDAY.

648
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
YOU CAME DOWN FROM BOSTON?

649
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
>> I DID, YES.

650
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
>> WHAT'S THE RED CROSS DOING

651
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
HERE?
>> I'M JOINED WITH 100 RED CROSS

652
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
VOLUNTEERS PROVIDING FOOD AND

653
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
WATER, ASSISTANCE TO NOT ONLY

654
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
THE AFFECTED FAMILIES BUT THE

655
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE WHOLE

656
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
COMMUNITY.

657
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
ONE OF OUR BIG PUSHES IS TO

658
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
PROVIDE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND

659
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
COUNSELING FOR THOSE WHO ARE

660
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
DEALING WITH THE UNIMAGINABLE.

661
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
IN FACT, TONIGHT WE WERE HERE,

662
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
WE HANDED OUT ABOUT 400 OF THESE

663
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
LITTLE PUPPIES TO THE KIDS

664
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
WAITING IN LINE.
JUST SOMETHING THEY COULD HOLD

665
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
ONTO, PROVIDE SOME SENSE OF

666
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
COMFORT TO THEM.

667
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
>> THIS IS FOR THE KIDS WAITING

668
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
IN LINE TO GET INTO THE SERVICE.

669
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
>> WE HANDED OUT ABOUT 900

670
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
BLANKETS.
IT'S COLD, IT'S RAINY, AND

671
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
THEY'RE REALLY JUST DEALING WITH

672
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
SUCH AN UNIMAGINABLE TRAGEDY.

673
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
WE WANT TO BE HERE TO JUST

674
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF SUPPORT

675
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
DURING THESE DARK DAYS.

676
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
>> HOW DO COUNSELORS -- WHAT

677
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
DOES A COUNSELOR SAY AT A TIME

678
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
LIKE THIS?

679
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
>> WELL, MANY PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY

680
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
ARE OVERCOME WITH GRIEF, AND

681
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
THAT'S NORMAL FOR THEM TO FEEL

682
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
THAT WAY, AND SO WE HAVE

683
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
COUNSELORS MEETING ONE-ON-ONE.

684
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
WE HAVE PEOPLE PROVIDING

685
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
RESOURCES JUST TO BE THERE IN

686
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
THE MOMENT.

687
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE --

688
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
HAVE BEEN PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED

689
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
DIRECTLY, HAVE LOST LOVED ONES.

690
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
OTHERS THAT JUST ARE IN A STATE

691
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
OF SHOCK BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW,

692
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
DRIVING THROUGH THIS COMMUNITY,

693
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
IT'S, YOU KNOW, QUINTESSENTIAL

694
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
SMALL TOWN THAT YOU'D LOVE TO BE

695
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
A PART OF, YOU'D LOVE TO LIVE

696
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
IN.
YOU SEE KIDS, A CLOSE-KNIT

697
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
COMMUNITY, AND IT'S BEEN ROCKED.

698
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
EVEN FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS FOR

699
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
THE RED CROSS, THIS IS A

700
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
MAGNITUDE THAT WE'RE CARING FOR

701
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
OUR VOLUNTEERS AS WELL BECAUSE

702
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
IT'S JUST SO OVERWHELMING, BUT

703
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
YET WE NEED TO PUT OUR GRIEF

704
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
ASIDE, COME IN AND DO THE JOB

705
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
THAT WE'RE HERE TO DO, AND JUST

706
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND THE PEOPLE

707
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
AND GIVE THEM A SHOULDER TO LEAN

708
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
ON.

709
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
>> YOU'RE ALSO REACHING OUT TO
FIRST RESPONDERS.

710
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
>> WE ARE, AND I'M SO AMAZED BY

711
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
THE PROFESSIONALISM.

712
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
YESTERDAY THERE WAS A POLICE

713
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
OFFICER IN FRONT OF ME, AND THIS

714
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
WOMAN CAME UP AND LITERALLY

715
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
COLLAPSED INTO HIS ARMS, AND HE

716
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
JUST WRAPPED HIMSELF AROUND HER

717
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
AND WAS A STEADY FORCE.

718
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
AND THESE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE THE

719
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
FABRIC OF THE COMMUNITY.

720
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
THEY HAVE KIDS, AND YET THEY'RE

721
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
HERE DOING THE JOB THAT THEY'VE

722
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
BEEN TRAINED TO DO.

723
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
SO THIS IS BIGGER THAN ONE

724
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
ORGANIZATION, ONE GROUP, BUT IF

725
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
THERE WAS ONE MESSAGE WE COULD

726
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
BRING TO THE COMMUNITY HERE,

727
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
THAT IS THAT PEOPLE ACROSS THIS

728
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
COUNTRY AND BEYOND ARE SENDING A

729
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
MESSAGE OF LOVE AND HOPE AND

730
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
SUPPORT, AND THE RED CROSS IS

731
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO STAY

732
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
HERE AS LONG AS NEEDED.

733
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
>> AND I CERTAINLY HOPE PEOPLE

734
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
IN THIS COMMUNITY FEEL THAT

735
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD FROM PEOPLE

736
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
ALL AROUND THE WORLD, AND THIS

737
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
IS -- THIS HAS BEEN THE FRONT

738
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
PAGE REPORTS IN ALL THE

739
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
NEWSPAPERS ALL AROUND THE WORLD,

740
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
AND WE'VE SEEN AN OUTPOURING OF

741
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
PEOPLE, AND I HOPE THAT THE

742
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
PEOPLE HERE FEEL THAT BECAUSE

743
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE AND A LOT

744
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
OF PRAYERS AND SUPPORT FOR THEM.

745
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
>> ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE MET

746
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
WITH AS WE HANDED THEM A DOG OR

747
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
A SNACK OR WATER OR A BLANKET

748
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
TONIGHT WERE THANKING US.

749
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
THIS IS THE LEAST WE CAN DO.

750
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
WE ARE HERE DURING THEIR TIME OF

751
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
NEED.
DRIVING THROUGH TOWN TONIGHT,

752
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
THERE WAS A VILLAGIL OF 26 LITT

753
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
ANGELS, CARDS PEOPLE WERE

754
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
SIGNING.

755
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
THERE'S SUCH AN OUTPOURING OF

756
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
COMMUNITY SPIRIT IN THE FACE OF

757
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
SUCH HORROR, AND SO OUR HOPE IS

758
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
THAT WE CAN JOIN SHOLDER TO

759
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
SHOULDER AND ARM IN ARM AND JUST

760
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
BE HERE IN THEIR MOMENT OF NEED.

761
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
>> YOU CAME FROM -- BEFORE THIS

762
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
YOU WERE AT HURRICANE SANDY

763
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
RESPONDING TO THAT.
WHAT IS IT LIKE FOR YOU TO SEE

764
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
THIS?

765
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
>> WHEN WE RECEIVED THE CALL

766
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
THAT THERE WAS A REPORT OF A

767
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
SHOOTING AT A SCHOOL, OUR HEARTS

768
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
SKIPPED A BEAT, AND WITHIN A

769
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
COUPLE HOURS WE KNEW THAT WE

770
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
WERE NEEDED.

771
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
WE ALREADY HAD LOCAL RED

772
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
CROSSERS HERE AND I WAS FROM

773
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
BOSTON.
WE JUMPED IN A CAR AND JUST

774
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
STARTED HEADING THIS DIRECTION

775
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
NOT KNOWING WHAT WE WERE GOING

776
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
TO FIND.

777
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
WHEN WE FIRST DROVE IN, WHAT

778
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
STRUCK ME WAS THE HOUSES OF

779
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
WORSHIP THAT WERE OVERFLOWING,

780
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
THE YOUNG KIDS, TOO YOUNG TO

781
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS WITH

782
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
THEIR HEADS HUNG LOW, AND THE

783
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
HUSH.
THERE WAS A VERY HUSH OF SILENCE

784
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
AS WE DROVE IN.

785
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
THE NEXT DAY TO SEE WHAT SHOULD

786
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
HAVE BEEN A JOYOUS HOLIDAY TIME

787
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
AND YET PEOPLE WERE DEALING WITH

788
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
LITTLE ONES, JUST LITTLE ONES

789
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
TAKEN FAR TOO SOON.

790
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
IT JUST WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU

791
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
HAD TO KIND OF GET AHOLD OF

792
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
YOURSELF.
FOR ME PERSONALLY, I WANTED TO

793
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
JUST SIT DOWN AND CRY MY EYES

794
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
OUT, RIGHT?
I THOUGHT OF MY OWN NIECES.

795
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I THOUGHT OF LITTLE ONES AROUND

796
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
THE HOLIDAYS WHO SHOULD BE OUT,

797
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
YOU KNOW, WITH SONGS AND LIGHTS

798
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
AND ENJOYING WHAT LIFE HAS TO

799
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
OFFER, BUT YET I FELT AS A RED

800
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
CROSS VOLUNTEER I NEEDED TO JUST

801
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
KIND OF COMPARTMENTALIZE, PUT IT

802
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
ASIDE, AND GO AND DO WHAT WE

803
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
NEEDED TO DO.

804
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
BUT IT'S FAR BEYOND WHAT I HAVE

805
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
EVER BEEN ON AND THE DEPLOYMENTS

806
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I HAVE DONE FOR THE RED CROSS,

807
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
BUT WE'RE HERE, WE TRAIN YEAR

808
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
ROUND FOR THIS AND THAT'S WHAT

809
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000

812
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
>> I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO HAS

813
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
BEEN HERE FOR A FEW DAYS THAT
HASN'T SHED A LOT OF TEARS.

814
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
>> THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR DOING.
>> THANK YOU.

815
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
REMARKABLE WORK.

816
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
WOLF, AGAIN, THAT'S THE SCENE

WE'VE BEEN GIVEN A 15-MINUTE

821
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000

INTERRUPTION.
WE WON'T BE TALKING OVER THE

826
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
SERVICE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

827
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
WE KNOW HOW ANNOYING THAT CAN BE

828
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000

EXPERIENCING IT THEMSELVES, AND

831
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
OUTSIDE THE SCENE AT THE HIGH
SCHOOL AGAIN, MORE PEOPLE STILL

832
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
CONTINUE TO COME AND THERE IS AN

833
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
OVERFLOW ROOM WE'RE TOLD, BUT WE

834
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
BELIEVE THAT'S ABOUT AT CAPACITY

835
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
AS WELL BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A

836
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KIND

837
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
OF TURNED AWAY AND ARE MOVING

838
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
BACK TO THEIR VEHICLES, WOLF.

839
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000

I'M DOWN THE STREET FROM THE

844
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
HIGH SCHOOL.
THIS IS A SERVICE THAT I THINK

845
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
ALL OF US WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER

846
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
THE PRESIDENT.

851
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
HE'S STILL COMFORTING SOME OF

852
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
THE FAMILY MEMBERS, THE PARENTS

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000

AND WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT

858
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
THESE VICTIMS.

866
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
HEARTBREAKING, WOLF, WHEN YOU

LOOK AT THIS LIST OF THESE 20

868
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
YOUNG VICTIMS AND NEVER HAVE I

869
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
EVER SEEN A LIST WHERE YOU LOOK

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
AT THE AGES AND THEY ARE ALL IN

871
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
THESE LITTLE ONES WHO ARE NO

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
LONGER WITH US, WE'RE LEARNING

875
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
ALSO ABOUT THE HEROES.

876
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
IN FACT, WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT

877
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
THIS FIRST GRADE TEACHER, VICKI,

878
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
SHE WENT BY VICKI, IT'S VICTORIA

879
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
SOTO.
HER LITTLE SISTER CARLY IS

880
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
INSIDE THAT MEMORIAL.

881
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
SHE JUST TWEETED ABOUT HER BIG

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
SISTER.
CARLY SOTO TWEETED, GOING TO

883
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000

884
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
WISH VICKI WAS HERE.

885
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
DRESSED IN ALL MY BIG SISTER'S

886
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
CLOTHES LOOKING CUTE IN HONOR OF

887
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
SISSY.

888
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
HER SISTER, VICKI, WAS THAT

889
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
FIRST GRADE TEACHER WHO QUICKLY

890
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
THOUGHT ON HER FEET AND

891
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
PROTECTED AS MANY OF HER LITTLE

892
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
6 AND 7-YEAR-OLDS AS SHE

893
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
POSSIBLY COULD.

894
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
IN FACT, POLICE LATER FOUND

895
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
SEVEN OF THOSE YOUNGSTERS SORT

896
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
OF HUDDLED SURVIVING IN A CLOSET

897
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
IN THAT FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM.

898
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
WE KNOW THAT ACCORDING TO

899
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
VICKI'S COUSIN, QUOTE, SHE

900
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
INSTINCTIVELY WENT INTO ACTION

901
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
WHEN A MONSTER CAME INTO A

902
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
CLASSROOM AND TRIED TO PROTECT

903
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
THE KIDS SHE LOVED SO MUCH.

904
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
WE WANT THE PUBLIC TO KNOW THAT

905
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
VICKI WAS A HERO.

906
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ANOTHER

907
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
HERO, THE PRINCIPAL.

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
DONNA HOCHSPRUNG, 47 YEARS OF

909
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
AGE.

910

HAD BEEN AT THIS ELEMENTARY

911
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
SCHOOL FOR TWO YEARS.

912
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
SHE WAS PASSIONATE.

913
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
SHE LOVED CHILDREN.

914
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
THE CHILDREN LOVED HER.

915
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
SHE HAD A SMILE ON HER FACE.

916
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
THIS ONE FRIEND SAYS SHE WAS A

944
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000

953
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000

1137
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
YOU, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

1138
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
PEOPLE SHOWED UP.

1139
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
THERE WERE AT LEAST 100 CARS AT

1140
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000

1141
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
THIS WAS YESTERDAY AFTERNOON,

1142
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
AND PEOPLE WENT IN AND THEY

1143
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
STAYED IN THERE FOR SOME TIME,

1144
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000

1152

1154
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000

SMALL TOWN WHERE PEOPLE KNOW

1156
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
EACH OTHER, THEY RAISED EACH

1157
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000

HAPPENS IN BIG CITIES.

1161
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT YOU CAN

1162
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
TELL IS VERY TIGHT-KNIT, AND

1163
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
WHEN THEY WENT TO A CRISIS

1164
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
CENTER, AS THEY CALL IT, I THINK

1165
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
A LOT OF THE COMFORT THEY WERE

1166
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
GETTING WAS JUST SIMPLY BEING

1167
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000

1168
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000

00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
GOING TO GO THROUGH AND GET

1172
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
THROUGH TOGETHER.

1173
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000

1183
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000

OFTEN TIMES DON'T HAVE TIME TO
