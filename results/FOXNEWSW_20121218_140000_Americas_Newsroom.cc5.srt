NOW THEY'RE AT 400,000.

70
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
SOME PEOPLE THINK IT SHOULD

72
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
THERE WAS A OFFER FROM THE

250,000 AND ABOVE TO 400.

99
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
DEMOCRATS SAY A BIG, BIG

100
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
MOVE BY THE PRESIDENT.

101
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
WHETHER OR NOT THAT WILL

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
ACTUALLY GO OVER WITH

103
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
REPUBLICANS PARTICULARLY IN

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
THE HOUSE IS VERY, VERY OPEN

105
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
QUESTION.
THEY'RE MEETING AS WE SPEAK

106
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
OVER ON THE HOUSE SIDE.

107
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
MR. BOEHNER AND HIS

109
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000

LATEST OFFER FROM THE

111
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000

REPUBLICANS.
THE UNIFIED REPUBLICAN

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
LEADERSHIP IS KEY HERE.

115
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
THUS FAR BOEHNER HAD THE GOP

116
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
PRETTY MUCH BEHIND HIM.

117
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
THE SPEAKER, HIS MAJORITY

118
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
KEVIN McCARTHY AND BUDGET

120
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
CHAIRMAN PAUL RYAN HAVE BEEN

121
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
VERY, VERY STRONGLY LOCKED

122
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
IN ARMS AS THEY'RE

123
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
NEGOTIATING WITH THE
PRESIDENT GIVING BOEHNER AN

124
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
OPPORTUNITY TO GO DOWN THERE

125
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
AND SAYING WHAT COULD BE A

126
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
FEASIBLE DEAL OR NOT.

127
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
THERE IS LOT OF SKEPTICISM

128
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
AMONG THOSE LEADERS ABOUT

129
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
THIS PROPOSAL FROM THE

130
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
PRESIDENT.

131
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THEY SAY THE TAX RELIEF IS

132
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
TOO MUCH.

133
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
STILL TOO HIGH AT $1.2

134
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
TRILLION AND THAT THE

135
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
PRESIDENT'S SPENDING

136
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
REDUCTIONS AREN'T BALANCED.

137
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
THEY INSIST MR. BOEHNER AND

138
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE PUT THE

139
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
POSSIBILITY OF TAX INCREASES

140
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
AND LETTING BUSH TAX CUTS

141
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
EXPIRE FOR THE WEALTHIEST ON

142
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THE TABLE BUT THEIR

143
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
THRESHOLD IS A MILLION

144
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
DOLLARS OF INCOME AND

145
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
HIGHER.
BY PUTTING IT ON THE TABLE

146
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THEY SAY THE PRESIDENT HAS

147
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
TO COME UP WITH SIGNIFICANT

148
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
SPENDING REDUCTIONS AND THEY

149
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
ARGUE THAT HAS YET TO

150
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
APPEAR.
WHEN THEY COME OUT OF THE

151
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
MEETING AT 9:00 REPUBLICANS

152
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
WILL HAVE A LOT MORE TO SAY.

153
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THEY BELIEVE THERE IS

154
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
POTENTIAL FOR PROGRESS BUT

155
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
NO DEAL YET.

156
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
BILL: TWO YEARS AGO THEY

157
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
THOUGHT THEY HAD A DEAL AND

158
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
THREW HIM OUT THE DOOR.

159
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
12, 13 DAYS AGO, WHAT WOULD

160
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
BE THE TIMETABLE THEN, CARL?

161
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
>> Reporter: VIRTUALLY

162
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
PASSED AS WE SPEAK.

163
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
BECAUSE OF THE CHRISTMAS

164
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
HOLIDAY THE LIKELIHOOD OF

165
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS

166
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
GETTING ANY SORT OF A

167
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
MIRACLE DEAL TOGETHER THAT

168
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
COULD PASS MUSTER WITH THE

169
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
WHITE HOUSE AND DEMOCRATS IS

170
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
SMALL.
IF THAT MIRACLE WERE TO

171
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
HAPPEN, IT IS LESS LIKELY

172
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
THE SENATE COULD COME BACK

173
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
AFTER CHRISTMAS AND GET

174
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
ANYTHING DONE BEFORE NEW

175
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
YEAR'S.

176
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THERE HAS BEEN A LOSS HERE

177
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
IN THE SENATE.

178
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THE SENATOR FROM THE HAWAII,

179
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
DANIEL INOUYE AT 88 YEARS

180
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
OLD PASSED AWAY YESTERDAY.

181
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
THAT WILL LIKELY CAUSE

182
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
INTERRUPTION FOR A FEW DAYS

183
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
FOR MEMORIAL SERVICES NEXT

184
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
COUPLE WEEKS.

185
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
WHETHER FOR THE PRESIDENT

186
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
AND MOST MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

187
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
TO GO TO HAWAII OR FOR THE

188
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
LATE SENATOR TO LIE IN STATE

189
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
AT THE CAPITOL, ALL THINGS

190
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
WOULD CUT UP MORE TIME,

191
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
MEANING IN ALL LIKELIHOOD,

192
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
IF THEY FIND AN AGREEMENT

193
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED

194
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
REAL THEY WOULD HAVE TO GIVE

195
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
THEMSELVES A LITTLE BIT OF

196
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
OVERTIME AND PASS ONE OF THE

197
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
LEGISLATIVE VEHICLES THAT

198
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
ESSENTIALLY STOPS THE CLOCK

199
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
TO TAKE IT INTO NEW YEAR'S.

200
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
THAT WAS NOT THE PLAN.

201
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
THAT IS WHY THEY PUT

202
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
TOGETHER WHAT WAS CALLED

203
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
SEQUESTER SO THEY WOULD BE

204
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
FORCED TO PUT A LEGISLATIVE

205
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
GUN TO THEIR HEADS TO MAKE A

206
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
DEAL.

207
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
LOOKS LIKE THEY MAY GIVE

208
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
THEMSELVES A LITTLE BIT OF

209
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
AFTER SCHOOL STUDY TIME.

210
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
BILL: WE'LL SEE HOW THAT

211
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
PAYS OFF.

212
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
CARL CAMERON LEADING OUR

213
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
COVERAGE.
THANK YOU, SIR.

214
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
MARTHA: THE BOTTOM LINE

215
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
REALLY DOES THIS DEAL BEGIN

216
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
TO ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC

217
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
PROBLEMS THAT EXIST IN THIS

218
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
COUNTRY?

219
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
STUART VARNEY, THE ANCHOR OF

220
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
"VARNEY & COMPANY" ON THE

221
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
FOX BUSINESS NETWORK, HAS

222
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS

223
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
MORNING AND FOR MANY DAYS IN

224
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
FACT.
STUART, WHAT DO YOU THINK

225
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
ABOUT THIS DEAL, DOES IT

226
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
HELP?

227
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
>> OKAY, IF YOU LOOK AT THIS

228
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
PURELY ECONOMICALLY, THEN

229
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
THIS FRAMEWORK OF A DEAL

230
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
DOES NOT ADDRESS AMERICA'S

231
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
TWO MAJOR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.

232
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
THAT WOULD BE GROWTH AND

233
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
ALSO THE DEBT.

234
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
JUST LOOK AT THE SPENDING

235
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
SIDE OF THE FRAMEWORK FOR

236
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
THIS DEAL.

237
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT

238
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
OFFERING ANY SIGNIFICANT CUT

239
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
IN SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS

240
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
IN THE FUTURE.

241
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
IT'S A TINY CUT.

242
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
IF YOU LOOK AT MEDICARE, THE

243
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
PRESIDENT WANTS TO KEEP THE

244
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
AGE OF ELIGIBILITY AT 65.

245
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
NO SAVINGS THERE BY GOING TO

246
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
67.
THE PRESIDENT WANTS A

247
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
TWO-YEAR DEBT LIMIT DEBATE.

248
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
ACTUALLY HE WANTS A TWO YEAR

249
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
PERIOD, IN WHICH HE CAN

250
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
SPEND MONEY FREELY, A BLANK

251
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
CHECK FOR SPENDING BECAUSE

252
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
THERE WILL BE NO DEBT

253
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
CEILING DEBATE FOR TWO

254
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
YEARS.

255
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
HE ALSO WANTS $50 BILLION

256
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
WORTH OF NEW SPENDING ON

257
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
INFRASTRUCTURE.

258
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
YOU ADD ALL OF THAT LOT UP

259
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
TOGETHER, WHAT YOU'RE

260
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
LOOKING AT IS A TRILLION

261
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
DOLLAR DEFICIT FOR THE NEXT

262
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
FOUR YEARS EACH AND EVERY

263
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
YEAR.

264
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
YOU'RE ALSO LOOKING, IF YOU

265
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
COUPLE IT WITH TAX HIKES

266
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
THERE IS ALSO IN THAT

267
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
FRAMEWORK, YOU'RE LOOKING AT

268
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
A GROWTH RATE OF MAYBE 2 OR

269
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
3% FOR THE ECONOMY AT BEST.

270
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
NOT THE 4, 5, 6% WE WANT.

271
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
DIRECTLY TO ANSWER YOUR
QUESTION, MARTHA, THIS

272
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
FRAMEWORK DOES NOT ANSWER

273
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
AMERICA'S PRINCIPLE ECONOMIC

274
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
PROBLEMS OF THE DAY.

275
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
MARTHA: FOR THOSE WHO ARE

276
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
WORRIED WE ARE SLIPPING

277
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
CLOSER TO BECOMING A

278
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
GREASE-LIKE SITUATION.
IT SOUND AS IF YOU'RE SAYING

279
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
THIS IS NO REMEDY FOR THAT,

280
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THIS IS A BANDAID AT BEST?

281
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
>> NO, IT IS NOT.
YOU'RE GUARANTEED MUCH

282
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
HIGHER DEFICITS CONTINUING

283
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
INTO THE FUTURE, AT LEAST A

284
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

285
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
GREECE HAS A DEBT PROBLEM.

286
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT DEBT

287
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
PROBLEM.

288
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
MARTHA: INDEED.
STUART, THANK YOU.

289
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
>> SURE.

290
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
BILL: $16 TRILLION.

AS POLICE CONTINUE THEIR

300
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
INVESTIGATION THERE.
THERE ARE QUESTIONS WHETHER

301
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
IT WILL BE EVER REOPEN.

302
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000

COULD HAVE BEEN ANYTHING IF

328
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
HE HAD GROWN UP.

329
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
THIS IS TRAGEDY THAT WE HAVE

HAVE LEARNED NEW THINGS

336
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
ABOUT ADAM LANZA.

337
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
PARTICULARLY HE TRIED

338
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
DESPERATELY TO COVER HIS

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000

ACCORDING TO POLICE SOURCES

343
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000

344
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
DIFFICULT TO READ HIS

BABY-SITTER WAS SAYING THERE

348
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
WERE EARLY SIGNS OF HIS

349
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
UNPREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR.

350
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000

PAIN.

365
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
HE SPENT MOST OF THE TIME

366
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000

SHE MISSED TWO CRITICAL

POINTS.

693
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
SHE WILL MISS THE HEARING ON

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
TRYING TO GO AROUND SOME OF

703
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000

704
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000

AVOID SPEAKING IN PUBLIC.

706
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I THINK THESE WITNESSES ON

708
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000

DESIGNATED HITTER?

713
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
WHY DIDN'T ONE OF SECRETARY

714
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
CLINTON'S TWO DEPUTIES

THEY WILL BE UP THERE

716

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S OFFER

940
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
LAST NIGHT TO AGAIN TRY TO

941
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
RAISE REVENUE, DECREASE

942
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
SPENDING AND COME UP WITH A

943
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
BALANCED PLAN TO AVOID THE

944
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
FISCAL CLIFF OF MANDATORY

945
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
TAX INCREASES AND SPENDING

946
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
CUTS.
TURNS OUT THE REPUBLICANS

947
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
WERE PROBABLY GOING TO BE

948
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
APPREHENSIVE ABOUT IT, BUT

949
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
MR. BOEHNER WENT INTO THE

950
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
MEETING WITH ALTERNATIVE.

951
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE

952
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
CALENDAR.

953
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
SO FAR INABILITY TO BREAK

954
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
THE JOG LAM ON A REAL DEAL

955
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
HERE.
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO

956
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
SIDES.
AS A CONSEQUENCE HE TOLD HIS

957
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
MEMBERS HE HAS GOT A PLAN B.

958
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I WANT TO READ REMARKS WE

959
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
KNOW HE IS SAYING BEHIND

960
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
CLOSED DOORS TO HIS FELLOW

961
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
REPUBLICANS.
HE WILL SAY OR HAS SAID,

962
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
QUOTE, FOR WEEKS SENATE

963
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
REPUBLICANS AND A GROWING

964
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
NUMBER OF YOU, MEANING HOUSE

965
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN

966
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
PUSHING FOR US TO PIVOT TO A

967
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
PLAN B I THINK THERE IS

968
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
BETTER WAY BUT THE

969
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
WHITE HOUSE CAN'T SEEM TO

970
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
BRING TO A BALANCED APPROACH

971
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
AND TIME IS RUNNING SHORT.

972
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
TAXES ARE GOING UP ON

973
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
EVERYONE JANUARY 1st.
THEY ARE BAKED INTO CURRENT

974
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
LAW AND WE HAVE TO STOP

975
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
WHATEVER RATE INCREASE WE

976
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
CAN IN THE ABSENCE OF

977
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
ALTERNATIVE THIS MORNING,

978
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
THIS MORNING A MODIFIED PLAN

979
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
B IS THE PLAN.

980
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
THAT PLAN B BOEHNER IS

981
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
PROPOSING TO HOUSE

982
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
REPUBLICANS COULD WOULD BE

983
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
VOTE IN THE HOUSE TO EXTEND

984
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
THE TAX REDUCTIONS OF THE

985
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
BUSH ERA ON EVERYBODY MAKING

986
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
UNDER A MILLION DOLLARS.

987
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY AVERT

988
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
HAVING TAXES GO UP ON THE

989
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
FIRST OF THE YEAR AND

990
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
DAMAGING THE ECONOMY.

991
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
HOW THIS WOULD BE ARRANGED

992
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
WITH THE SENATE AND THE

993
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
PRESIDENT VERY MUCH UP IN

994
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
THE AIR BUT A CLEAR SIGN

995
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
FROM HOUSE REPUBLICANS THAT

996
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THE TIME HAS ALL BUT RUN OUT

997
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
AND THEY NEED SOME SORT OF A

998
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
STOPGAP MEASURE TO AVERT

999
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
GOING OVER THE CLIFF,

1000
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
HURTING THE ECONOMY WITH

1001
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
MASSIVE TAX INCREASES AND

1002
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
SPENDING REDUCTIONS

1003
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
MANDATORY WITH SOME SORT OF

1004
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
A STOPGAP.

1005
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
WHETHER OR NOT THAT GOES

1006
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
OVER WITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS.

1007
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
DEMOCRATS SAY THIS OBVIOUSLY

1008
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
WILL BE A BAD THING.

1009
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
NEGOTIATIONS DO CONTINUE,

1010
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
BILL.

1011
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
BILL: THAT IS IMPORTANT

1012
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
POINT.
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE

1013
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
NEGOTIATIONS DO CONTINUE.

1014
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
JUST SO OUR VIEWERS NO.

1015
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
BOB CORKER IS AT THE TOP OF

1016
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
THE 10:00 HOUR.

1017
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
HE SAYS WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR A

1018
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
DEAL.
WE'LL TALK WITH HIM ABOUT

1019
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
THAT.

1020
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM

1021
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER AT 11:00

1022
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000

TIME'S A WASTING.

1025
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
CARL CAMERON ON THE HILL.

1026
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
MARTHA: THERE ARE SO MANY

1027
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
NEW QUESTIONS NOW ABOUT HOW

1028
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
SCHOOLS AND HOW SOCIETY CAN

1029
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
BETTER ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF

1030
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
MENTAL ILLNESS IN LIGHT OF

1031
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
THE TRAGIC SCHOOL SHOOTING

1032
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000

SUFFERED FROM MENTAL ILLNESS

1035
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
ISSUES.

1036
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
WE'RE STILL LEARNING TO WHAT

1037
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
EXTENT THEY EXISTED AND FOR

1038
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
HOW LONG THEY EXISTED BUT HE

1039
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
IS CLEARLY NOT THE ONLY

1040
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
GUNMAN IN THESE KINDS OF

1041
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
RANDOM MASS SHOOTINGS THAT

1042
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
WE HAVE SEEN WHO BATTLED

1043
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
MENTAL DISORDERS.

1044
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

1045
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
THAT.

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
HOW ABOUT THIS FROM

1047

1050
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000

1051
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
INVOLVED IN THESE SITUATIONS

1052
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1078
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
MARTHA: IT IS SO

1079
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
GUT-WRENCHING, WHEN YOU LOOK

OF THESE YOUNG MEN.

1086
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
THERE'S A PROFILE THAT

1087
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
EMERGES IN THE COMMON

1088
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
QUALITIES, ALL UNDER 25

1089
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000

YOU HAVE JIRD LOUGHNER FROM

AURORA, COLORADO, SHOOTING.

1098
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
THERE ARE A LOT OF SIMILAR

1099
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
CHARACTERISTICS IN THESE

1100
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
YOUNG MEN.

1101
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
ALL OF THEM HAD INTERVENTION

1102
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
WHAT DOES IT TELL US WHAT

1106
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
WE'RE NOT DOING RIGHT IN

1107
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
TERMS OF TREATING THESE

1108
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
ISSUES?
>> FIRST OF ALL I THINK IT

1109
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE

1110
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
DISCUSSION AROUND WHAT TO DO

1111
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
FOCUSES NOT JUST ON THE

1112
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
SECOND AMENDMENT.

1113
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
PRECISELY ON THE PROFILE AND

1114
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
TROUBLED PROFILES OF SO MANY

1115
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
OF THESE ACTORS.
TO YOUR POINT, WHICH IS

1116
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
WELL-STATED AND VERY

1117
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
IMPORTANT IN THE NATIONAL

1118
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
DISCUSSION, YOU TAKE A LOOK

1119
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
AT THE INCIDENT AND COME

1120
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE

1121
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
INDIVIDUALS AND THERE IS,

1122
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
WELL IT'S NOT UNIVERSALLY

1123
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
APPLIED, THERE ARE MANY,

1124
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
MANY INSTANCES WHERE THESE

1125
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
YOUNG MEN HAD SERIOUS MENTAL

1126
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
HEALTH PROBLEMS.

1127
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
WHEN I SERVED ON THE

1128
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
VIRGINIA TECH PANEL IT WAS

1129
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
QUITE OBVIOUS CHO HIMSELF

1130
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
HAD A DETERIORATING MENTAL

1131
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
CONDITION THAT WAS

1132
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
RECOGNIZED EARLY ON IN GRADE

1133
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL.

1134
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
FOLLOWED ALL THE WAY

1135
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
THROUGH.
RECOGNIZED BY TEACHERS AND

1136
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
RECOGNIZED BY A SPECIAL

1137
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
JUSTICE HE WAS IN POTENTIAL

1138
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
OF DANGER HARMING HIMSELF

1139
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
AND THE COMMUNITY, YET THE

1140
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
TREATMENT WAS INADEQUATE.

1141
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
THIS IS REMINISCENT OF SOME

1142
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAD

1143
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
SETTING UP HOMELAND SECURITY,

1144
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
BALANCING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS
WITH A NEED FOR COMMUNITIES

1145
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
TO BE SAFE AND SECURE.

1146
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
IT IS NOT JUST THE SECOND

1147
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
AMENDMENT.

1148
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
THERE IS A RIGHT OF PRIVACY.

1149
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO

1150
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
LOOK AT VERY CAREFULLY

1151
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
BECAUSE IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED

1152
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
IN THE CONSTITUTION BUT IT

1153
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
IS A RIGHT PEOPLE, THAT THE

1154
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
LAWYERS AND THE SUPREME

1155
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
COURT HAVE PROTECTED FOR A

1156
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
LONG TIME BUT WE'VE GOT TO

1157
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE.

1158
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
FIREARMS IN THE HANDS OF

1159
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
MENTALLY DISABLED, MENTALLY

1160
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
CHALLENGED INDIVIDUALS,

1161
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
MAYBE BE AT THE EPICENTER OF

1162
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
A LOT OF PROBLEMS WE HAVE

1163
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
HAD.
MARTHA: YOU LOOK AT MENTAL

1164
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
HEALTH AND HISTORY OF IT IN

1165
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
THIS COUNTRY AND WE'VE

1166
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
GOTTEN AWAY FROM THE TIME WE

1167
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
HAD INSTITUTIONS AND PEOPLE

1168
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
WERE COMMITTED TO AN

1169
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
INSTITUTION IF THEIR

1170
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
FAMILIES COULD NOT DEAL WITH

1171
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
THEM.

1172
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
THAT UNDERSTANDABLY RAN INTO

1173
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
SOME BAD SITUATIONS WHERE

1174
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
PEOPLE WERE COMMITTED.

1175
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
THEY WERE IN INSTITUTIONS

1176
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
THAT WERE HORRIBLE.

1177
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
THAT WERE OFFENSIVE TO

1178
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
EVERYBODY'S SENSIBILITY.

1179
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
THEN WE GOT INTO A TIME

1180
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
PERIOD WHERE WE WANTED TO

1181
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
SORT OF MAINSTREAM

1182
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
EVERYBODY.

1183
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

1184
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
LIVE IN SOCIETY AND YOU KNOW,

1185
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES

1186
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
EVERYONE ELSE HAS.

1187
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
NOW YOU HAVE A SITUATION

1188
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
WHERE, THERE'S A VERY

1189
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
POIGNANT BLOG THAT WENT OUT

1190
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
THIS MORNING BY A WOMAN WHO

1191
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
IS STRUGGLING WITH A CHILD

1192
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
WHO SHE SAYS IS THE NEXT

1193
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
ADAM LANZA, OKAY?

1194
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
AND THE DESPERATION THAT

1195
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
THIS MOTHER FEELS IN THE

1196
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
LACK OF ABILITY TO GET HELP.

1197
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I WANT TO READ SOME OF THIS

1198
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
MOTHER'S BLOG TO YOU THIS

1199
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
MORNING.
SHE SAYS, NO ONE WANTS TO

1200
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
SEND A 13-YEAR-OLD GENIUS

1201
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
WHO LOVES "HARRY POTTER" AND

1202
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
HIS SNUGGLE ANIMAL

1203
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
COLLECTION TO JAIL BUT OUR

1204
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
SOCIETY WITH ITS STIGMA ON

1205
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
MENTAL ILLNESS AND ITS

1206
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
BROKEN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

1207
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
DOES NOT PROVIDE US WITH

1208
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
OTHER OPTIONS.

1209
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
THEN ANOTHER TORTURED SOUL

1210
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
SHOOTS UP A FAST-FOOD

1211
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
RESTAURANT, A MALL, A

1212
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM AND

1213
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
SHE GOES ON TO SAY WE WRING

1214
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
OUR HANDS AND SAY SOMETHING

1215
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
MUST BE DONE.

1216
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
THIS POOR MOTHER SHOWED UP

1217
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
AT HOSPITAL, SAID I NEED

1218
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000

00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
SOMEONE TAKE MY CHILD.

1220
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
HE IS THREATENING TO KILL MY

1221
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
OTHER CHILDREN AND ME.

1222
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
THE NEXT DAY HE IS DOCILE,

1223
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
AND HAPPY, MOMMY I WILL BE

1224
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
BETTER, I PROMISE.

1225
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
WHAT CAN WE OFFER THIS

1226
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
WOMAN?
>> FIRST OF ALL SHE IS HERRO

1227
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
ININ MY MIND, SHE RAISED IN

1228
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
A PUBLIC WAY A SITUATION A

1229
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
LOT OF PARENTS WOULD BE VERY

1230
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO RAISE,

1231
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
PUBLIC RECOGNITION THAT

1232
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
THEIR SON HAS A MENTAL

1233
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
HEALTH CHALLENGE.

1234
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
SHE ALSO USED A WORD VERY

1235
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
APPROPRIATE.

1236
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
IT IS WHY IT NEEDS TO BE

1237
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
PART OF THE NATIONAL

1238
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
DISCUSSION.

1239
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
WE STIGMATIZE YOUNG PEOPLE

1240
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS

1241
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
INSTEAD OF RECEIVING OUT

1242
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
TRYING TO HELP THEM.

1243
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
CLEARLY, CLEARLY THE MENTAL

1244
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
HEALTH COMMUNITY HAS BEEN

1245
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
ADEQUATELY STAFF,

1246
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
INADEQUATELY FUNDED FOR A

1247
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
LONG TIME.

1248
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
NOT THAT EVERYBODY NEEDS TO

1249
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
BE INSTITUTIONALIZED.

1250
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
NOT EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE

1251
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
PUT ON A DRUG REGIMEN.

1252
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
THE FACT OF MATTER REMAINS

1253
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
VARIOUS DEGREES OF MENTAL

1254
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
HEALTH ILLNESS HAVE TO BE

1255
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
RECOGNIZED AND DEALT WITH.

1256
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I LOVE JOE LIEBERMAN'S CALL

1257
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
FOR PARENTS AND FRIENDS TO

1258
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
RECOGNIZE THESE PROBLEM AND

1259
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
DIRECT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TO

1260
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
HELP.
THE PATTERN OF ACTIVITY YOU

1262
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN

1263
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
THESE MASS MURDERS HAVE

1264
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
TALKED ABOUT SUICIDE.

1265
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT

1266
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
KILLING OTHER PEOPLE BUT CAN

1267
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000

WHO TALKED ABOUT DOING

1271
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

1272
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
IT IS CULTURAL PROBLEM AND

1273
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM.

1274
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
WE BETTER ADDRESS IT SOON

1275
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
AND SERIOUSLY.

1276
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
MARTHA: ONE OF THE ISSUES IF

1277
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
SOMEONE HASN'T BEEN CHARGED

1278
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
WITH ANY CRIME AS ADAM LANZA

1279
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
WAS NOT.

1280
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
HE WASN'T EVEN ON THE RADAR

1281
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

1282
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000

EMERGENCY ROOM YOU WILL GET

1315
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000

THIS VERY IMPORTANT STORY

1325
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
THIS MORNING.
THIS IS A U.S. MARINE WHO

1326
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
LOCKED UP IN A NOTORIOUS

1327

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
TO HIS BED AS HIS FAMILY

1329
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
PLEADS AND SAYS THIS IS A

1330
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
HUGE MISTAKE.

1331
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
THEY WANT HELP FROM THE

1332
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
GOVERNMENT.

1333
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
>> EXAMINE THIS CASE.

1334
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
THIS IS WRONG, AND DO THE

1335
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
RIGHT THING.
HE SHOULD BE RELEASED

1336
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
IMMEDIATELY.
THIS WAS AN ADMINISTRATIVE

1337
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
MISTAKE.
HE IS NOT A GUNRUNNER.

1338
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
AND YOU KNOW IT.

1339
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
PLEASE RELEASE HIM.

1340
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000

family and friends find it

they're like high-definition for

get with other hearing aids.

1347

So now you can connect with
family and friends again

1348
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000

IN A MATTER OF MOMENTS.

1371
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
PLAN B APPARENTLY MIGHT BE

1372
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
ON THE TABLE AS A BACKUP TO

1373
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
YEARS AGO WHERE THE TWO OF

1394
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
YOU CAME ON TV FOR THE FIRST

1395
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
TIME.

1396
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
>> HAS IT BEEN THAT LONG?

1397
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
BILL: IT HAS BEEN THAT LONG.

1398
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
THE TIME HAS FLOWN.

1399
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
AND WHAT PEOPLE, PEOPLE ARE

1400
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
NOT GIVING US ANY CREDIT FOR

1401
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
CREATING "THE FIVE." WHICH

1402
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
EVENTUALLY LED TO THAT.

1403
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
>> FRANCHISE STARTED RIGHT

1404
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
HERE.

1405
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
>> HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, ANDREA,

1406
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
BILL.
YOU DID A TERRIFIC JOB IN

1407
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
CONNECTICUT.
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

1408
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
>> YES YOU DID, BILL.

1409
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
BILL: TOUGH STORY AS YOU CAN

1410
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
WELL SEE.
>> I COULDN'T IMAGINE.

1411
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
BILL: LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS

1412
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
ANDREA.

1413
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
WILL REPUBLICANS GO ALONG

1414
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
WITH BOEHNER OR TELL HIM TO

1415
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
GET OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN?

1416
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
>> IT DEPENDS WHAT HE IS

1417
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
PROPOSING.

1418
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
IF HE IS PROPOSING TO HAVE A

1419
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
VOTE EXTENDING ALL THE BUSH

1420
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
TAX CUTS THERE IS A VERY

1421
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
GOOD CHANCE THEY WILL GO

1422
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
ALONG WITH HIM BUT WHY

1423
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
DIDN'T HE DO THIS EARLIER? I

1424
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
SAID IT ON THE "THE FIVE"

1425
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
LAST WEEK.

1426
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
MY FIRST SUGGESTION, MY PLAN

1427
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
A WAS WALK AWAY LET OBAMA

1428
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
OWN IT.

1429
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
AS WE CAN SEE HE IS

1430
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
CONCEDING NOTHING.

1431
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
BUT THE PLAN B FROM THE

1432
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
START, PASS YOUR OWN PLAN,

1433
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
AND THEN LEAVE AND GET YOUR

1434
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
GUYS ON RECORD, YOUR GUYS

1435
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
AND GALS IN THE HOUSE GOP

1436
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
CONFERENCE ON RECORD WITH

1437
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
SOMETHING THEY CAN TAKE BACK

1438
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
TO THEIR DISTRICT.
A LOT OF THESE MEMBERS, BILL,

1439
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
ARE PETRIFIED TO VOTE FOR

1440
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
INCREASED TAXES BECAUSE
THINK ABOUT IT.

1441
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
THEY HAVE TO RUN FOR

1442
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
RE-ELECTION IN TWO YEARS.

1443
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
THEY'RE FEARING THE

1444
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
PRIMARIES FROM PEOPLE ON THE

1445
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
RIGHT.

1446
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
SO PASS YOUR OWN BILL AND

1447
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
LET HARRY REID HAVE THE GUTS

1448
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
TO BRING IT TO THE FLOOR.

1449
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I DOUBT HE WILL.
BILL: WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS

1450
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
TODAY, BOB?

1451
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
>> FIRST OF ALL I THINK

1452
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
REPUBLICANS WOULD PAY A

1453
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
PRICE FOR NOT GOING ALONG

1454
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
WITH THIS.

1455
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
THE IDEA OF A MILLION,

1456
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
MILLIONAIRE TAX BASICALLY

1457
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
HERE IS SOMETHING I CAN NOT

1458
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
IMAGINE THERE ARE TOO MANY

1459
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
MILLIONAIRES IN MOST OF

1460
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
THESE DISTRICTS.

1461
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT

1462
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
HAVE EVERYBODY GET A TAX ON

1463
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
1st OF JANUARY THEY WOULD

1464
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
BLAME THE REPUBLICANS NO

1465
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
QUESTION ABOUT IT.
PRESS WOULD.

1466
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I WOULD.

1467
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
MOST OF DEMOCRATS AND

1468
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
PRESIDENT WOULD.

1469
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
HERE'S THE DEAL.
OF COURSE BOEHNER WILL HAVE

1470
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
TO GET SOMETHING FOR THIS.

1471
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
THE QUESTION IS IT ON

1472
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
ENTITLEMENTS?
YES.

1473
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
CAN YOU GET ENTITLEMENTS

1474
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
WRITTEN BY END OF THIS YEAR?

1475
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
OF COURSE NOT.
WHAT HAS TO BE WHATEVER THE

1476
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
DEAL IS SOME DATE CERTAIN

1477
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
WHEN THEY REPORT OUT A

1478
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
CHANGE TO ENTITLEMENTS WITH

1479
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
SOME FIGURE ATTACHED TO IT.

1480
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
NOW, AND IF NOT THEY COULD

1481
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
COME BACK AND, UNDO THE TAX

1482
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
RATE INCREASE.
THAT IS ONLY WAY I COULD SEE

1483
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
THEY DO IT.

1484
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
>> THE PROBLEM IS --.

1485
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
BILL: DID YOU WANT TO

1486
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
RESPOND, ANDREA I'M SORRY?

1487
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
IT IS YOUR ANNIVERSARY.

1488
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I SHOULD RESPECT THAT.

1489
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
>> WHERE IS THE CAKE, RIGHT?

1490
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
WE'LL GET CELEBRATE A DEAL.

1491
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
THERE.

1492
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I DON'T THINK THERE IS

1493
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
POLITICAL APPETITE IN

1494
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CAUCUS TO

1495
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
GET THE MEMBERS TO AGREE ON

1496
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
SOME FORM OF ENTITLEMENTS.

1497
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
FRANKLY, BILL, THE PRESIDENT

1498
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
HAS CONCEDED NOTHING.

1499
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
BILL: LET ME MAKE THIS

1500
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
POINT.
YOU GUYS CAN REACT TO IT.

1501
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
AND THERE'S A LOT OF

1502
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
REPORTING ABOUT THIS
THROUGHOUT THE MORNING.

1503
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A DEAL

1504
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
THAT WILL SAVE $2 TRILLION

1505
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
OVER 10 YEARS.

1506
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
WE'RE ALREADY AT 16

1507
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
TRILLION.

1508
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
WE'LL BE AT 20 TRILLION IN

1509
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
FOUR YEARS FOR SURE.

1510
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
SAVING $2 TRILLION?

1511
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS?

1512
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
WE'RE LEFT WITH A HUGE BAG

1513
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
ON OUR HANDS AT THE END OF

1514
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
THAT DEAL ANYWAY, AREN'T WE,

1515
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
BOB?
>> YEAH.

1516
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
FIRST OF ALL, FUNNY WHAT YOU

1517
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
SAY 2 TRILLION IF IT IS

1518
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
TRUMP CHANGE.

1519
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
IN THIS DAY AND AGE IT SEEMS

1520
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
LIKE THAT.
BILL: RIDICULOUS, RIGHT.

1521
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
>> WHAT YOU DON'T INCLUDE

1522
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
ENTITLEMENT CUTS WHICH THERE

1523
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
WILL BE.

1524
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
HERE IS ANSWER FOR

1525
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS, IF

1526
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
REPUBLICANS GO ALONG WITH

1527
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
TAX RATE INCREASES ON RICH

1528
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
THEN THE DEMOCRATS IF THEY

1529
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
DON'T DO SOMETHING ON

1530
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
ENTITLEMENTS WILL TAKE

1531
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
POLITICAL HEAT FOR IT.

1532
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
BILL: ALL RIGHT.

1533
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
ANDREA.
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

1534
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
>> I THINK THAT BOB IS BEING

1535
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
ACTUALLY REASONABLE AT THIS

1536
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
MOMENT AND HE HAS SOME GOOD

1537
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
IDEAS THAT HE MENTIONED

1538
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
BEFORE LIKE RAISING AGE OF

1539
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
ELIGIBILITY, BUT I DON'T

1540
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
THINK A LOT OF MEMBERS IN

1541
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS WILL

1542
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
GO ALONG WITH IT.

1543
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I DON'T.

1544
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
AS FAR AS RAISING TAXES ON

1545
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
RICH, BOB, THEY STILL CAN'T

1546
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
AGREE WHAT IS RICH.

1547
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
IS IT GOING TO BE MILLION

1548
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
DOLLARS?

1549
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
PRESIDENT SAYS 400,000.

1550
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
AND I DO AGREE WITH YOU ON

1551
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
ONE POINT, BOB, REPUBLICANS

1552
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
DO NOT WANT TO LOOK LIKE

1553
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
THEY'RE PROTECTING THE RICH

1554
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
BUT I THINK THEY FIGURE

1555
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
WE'RE GETTING BLAMED ANYWAY

1556
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
SO WE MIGHT AS WELL STAND UP

1557
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
FOR --.
BILL: SORRY, GUYS.

1558
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
WE DID NOT, WE'LL GET TO

1559
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
THAT IN A MOMENT.

SPEAKER BOEHNER AT THE TOP

1561
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000

HE SAYS TODAY, WE'RE NOT

1566
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
CLOSE.

1567
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I'M SURPRISED AT REPORTING

1569
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
UNLESS SOMETHING HAPPENED AT

1570
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
6:00 A.M. WE'RE NOT CLOSE TO

1571
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
A DEAL.
WE'LL GET HIS REACTION.

1572
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000

1586
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
MUCH MORE GOES OUT?

1587
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
WE ALL KNOW ONE NUMBER IS A

1588
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
LOT BIGGER THAN THE OTHER,

1589
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
RIGHT?

1590
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
WHERE DO YOUR TAX DOLLARS

1591
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000

AND CONGRESS TRYING TO

1611

1613

YOU'VE HEARD THAT, RIGHT?

1614
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
THINK ABOUT THIS.

1615
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
EVERY DAY THE GOVERNMENT

1616
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
TAKES IN $6 BILLION AND IT

1617
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
SPENDS 10 DAL BILLION.

1618
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
SO WHERE IS ALL THAT MONEY

1619
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000

1627
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
MORNING TO YOU.

1628
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
VIRTUALLY EVERY PRESIDENT

1629
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
SINCE REAGAN TALKED ABOUT

1630
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
THE NEED TO REDUCE DEFICIT

1631
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
SPENDING OF THE PRESIDENT
OBAMA IS NO EXCEPTION.

1632
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
>> I'VE SHOWN MYSELF WILLING

1633
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000

SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER INSISTS

1638
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS

1639
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
SPEAK VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN

1640
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
HIS WORDS.
>> IT'S CLEAR THE PRESIDENT

1641
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
IS JUST NOT SERIOUS ABOUT

1642
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
CUTTING SPENDING BUT

1643
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
SPENDING IS THE PROBLEM.

1644
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
>> Reporter: SO HOW BIG OF A

1645
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
PROBLEM?

1646
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT LAST

1647
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
NOVEMBER ALONE.

1648
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
EACH DAY THAT MONTH THE

1649
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
GOVERNMENT BROUGHT IN ABOUT

1650
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
$5 BILLION OF REVENUE BUT WE

1651
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
SPENT MORE THAN $11 BILLION

1652
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
A IN NOVEMBER.
THE DIFFERENCE?

1653
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
OBVIOUSLY $6 BILLION.

1654
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
HERE'S WHERE MOST OF THAT

1655
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
MONEY GOES.

1656
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
THE TOP FOUR OUTLAYS.

1657
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
AT TOP OF THE LIST THE

1658
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND

1659
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
HUMAN SERVICES WHICH GOES

1660
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
THROUGH $3 BILLION OF YOUR

1661
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
TAX AS DAY.

1662
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000

1.8 BILLION DAILY.

1667
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
BUT ECONOMISTS SAY MOST

1668
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
CONCERNING IS THE INTEREST

1669
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
ON THE DEBT.
RIGHT NOW IT IS AT $854

1670

01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
IF THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT

1849
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
HAPPENS THIS YEAR, THEN TAXES DO

1850
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,000
GO UP BU UP ON EVERYBODY WHO

1851
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
MAKES LESS THAN A MILLION

1852
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
DOLLARS A YEAR.

1853
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS FIGHTING

1854
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
THIS BATTLE FOR YEARS NOW WILL

1855
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
GO INTO THE NEW YEAR AND WILL

1856
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
HAVE VOTED ON A MEASURE IN THE

1857
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
END TO RAISE TAXES.

1858
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
>> NO, THERE IS A WAY, BILL,

1859
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
THAT THEY CAN VOTE AND NOT RAISE

1860
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
TAXES.

1861
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
THEY CAN ACTUALLY VOTE TO FREEZE

1862
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
EVERYBODY'S TAXES.

1863
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
THEY CAN VOTE TO FREEZE

1864
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
EVERYBODY UNDER A MILLION.

1865
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
BILL: FOR EVERYONE.

1866
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
>> YEAH.

1867
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS ALL OF THEM

1868
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
CAN VOTE TO KEEP THE BUSH TAX

1869
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
CUTS IN PLACE, AND WHEN IT COMES

1870
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
OVER TO THE SENATE THEN THE

1871
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
SENATE CHANGES IT, OBVIOUSLY I'D

1872
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
BE VOTING THE WAY THE HOUSE

1873
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
MEMBERS HAVE VOTED, BUT, NO,

1874
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
THERE IS A WAY OF DOING THAT

1875
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
WITHOUT THEM ACTUALLY VOTING FOR

1876
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
ANY KIND OF TAX INCREASE.

1877
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
BILL: I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT

1878
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
THAT.

1879
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
THE WAY I READ YOUR COMMENT FROM

1880
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
EARLIER TODAY SUGGESTED THAT

1881
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
HOUSE REPUBLICANS WOULD VOTE ON

1882
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
RAISING TAXES.
>> NO.

1883
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
BILL: WHETHER IT'S A MILLIONAIRE

1884
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
OR WHETHER IT'S NOT.

1885
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
THEN YOU GO INTO THE NEW YEAR

1886
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
THAT IS THE ONLY THING YOU GET

1887
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
ACCOMPLISHED NOW.

1888
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
>> IT'S UNFORTUNATE.

1889
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW, THOUGH, BILL,

1890
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
THAT YOU CAN AGREE TO GIVE AWAY

1891
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
THE DEBT CEILING INCREASE TO

1892
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
THIS PRESIDENT WHO IS RED LINING

1893
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
OUR COUNTRY WITH SPENDING RIGHT

1894
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
NOW.
HE WANTS US TO GIVE AWAY THE

1895
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
DEBT CEILING, DO AWAY WITH THE

1896
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
SEQUESTER WHICH IS 1.2 TRILLION

1897
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
IN REDUCTIONS OVER THE NEXT

1898
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
DECADE AND ALL HE'S LAYING ON

1899
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
THE TABLE IS 400 BILLION IN

1900
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
REDUCTIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIC,

1901
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
ONLY 200 BILLION OF THOSE ARE

1902
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
ENTITLEMENTS AND ANOTHER TO BE

1903
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
TKERPD DISCUSSION THAT LEND IN

1904
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
ANOTHER FISCAL CLIFF IN A YEAR.

1905
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
SO, BILL I THINK WHAT THE HOUSE

1906
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
IS SAYING IS THAT LOOK, WE

1907
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
REALIZE THAT WE REALIZE WHERE WE

1908
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
ARE, WE WANT TO RESCUE EVERYBODY

1909
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
WHO MAKES UNDER A MILLION

1910
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
DOLLARS.
THEY ARE STILL NOT GOING TO VOTE

1911
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
FOR ANY TAX INCREASE.

1912
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
THERE IS A WAY THEY CAN DO

1913
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
THAT.
UNFORTUNATELY WE'LL CARRY THIS

1914
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
ONTO THE DEBT CEILING AND

1915
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER HAS BEEN

1916
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS.
I THINK HE'S BEEN A HERO IN

1917
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
THIS.
BUT THE PRESIDENT STILL IS NOT

1918
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
FORTHCOMING, BILL, WITH ANY

1919
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
TANGIBLE ENTITLEMENT REFORMS.

1920
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
WITHOUT THAT YOU CANNOT SAVE OUR

1921
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
COUNTRY WITHOUT DOING THAT.

1922
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
BILL: I'M READING THROUGH A LOT

1923
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
OF THE REPORTS.

1924
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
LET ME -- THE AMOUNT OF SPENDING

1925
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
YOU'LL SAVE IN TEN YEARS WHICH

1926
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
AMOUNTS TO $2 TRILLION.

1927
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
WHEN YOU CONSIDER IN FOUR YEAR'S

1928
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
TIME WE'LL BE AT $20 TRILLION.

1929
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
IT'S SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT.

1930
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
YOU'RE GOING TO GO INTO THE NEW

1931
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
YEAR AND NONE OF THIS GETS

1932
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
ACCOMPLISHED.

1933
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
>> AND YOU'LL HAVE THE DEBT

1934
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
CEILING IN FEBRUARY OR MARCH

1935
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
WHICH WILL BE A WHOLE OTHER

1936
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
ROUND OF DISCUSSION.

1937
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
BILL: WHAT IS THE IMPACT AND

1938
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
THAT IS THE CASE AND REALITY AND

1939
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
THE WAY IT PLAYS OUT, IS THE

1940
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY.

1941
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
>> IT'S TERRIBLE, ABSOLUTELY

1942
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
TERRIBLE, BILL.

1943
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I LAID OUT A BILL ABOUT THREE

1944
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
WEEKS AGO THAT SPECIFICALLY SAID

1945
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
THE THINGS THAT WE NEEDED TO DO

1946
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
AS A NATION, AND I DON'T THINK

1947
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
ANYBODY ELSE HAS ACTUALLY DONE

1948
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
THAT IN LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE.

1949
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
WHAT THIS NATION NEEDS IS TO PUT

1950
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
THIS IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR,

1951
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
COME UP WITH 4 1/2 TO

1952
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
$5 TRILLION OF REFORMS AND

1953
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
SAVINGS AND CUTS TO REALLY LOWER

1954
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
THE DEFICIT THAT YOU'RE TALKING

1955
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
ABOUT.

1956
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
BY THE WAY IN THE OUT YEARS,

1957
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
BILL, IF YOU MAKE ENTITLEMENT

1958
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
REFORMS THE NUMBERS ARE TENS OF

1959
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND YOU

1960
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
SAVE THOSE PROGRAMS FOR FUTURE

1961
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
GENERATIONS.

1962
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
NO IT'S AN ABSOLUTE TRAVESTY

1963
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
THAT WE ARE WHERE WE ARE, WE ARE

1964
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
A GREAT NATION, EVERY DEVELOPED

1965
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD KNOWS OUR

1966
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
GREATEST THREAT IS OUR OWN

1967
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
FISCAL SOLVENCY AND WE HAVE A

1968
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
PRESIDENT THAT WE HAVE TO TRY TO

1969
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
LEVERAGE INTO A PLACE OF DOING

1970
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
THE THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY

1971
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
FOR OUR COUNTRY.

1972
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
IT'S A TRAVESTY.

1973
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
WHAT THIS MEANS IS THERE ARE

1974
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
AMERICANS OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE

1975
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
THAT WILL NOT SEE THE ECONOMIC

1976
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
PROSPECTS THIS NEXT YEAR THAT

1977
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN,

1978
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT IS

1979
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
UNWILLING TO LAYOUT A CONE

1980
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
WREATH PLAN TCONCRETE PLAN TO

1981
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
SAVE THIS NATION.

1982
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I THINK SPEAKER BOEHNER HAS BEEN

1983
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
TRYING TO GET THERE.

1984
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I THINK IT'S A TRAVESTY.

1985
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
BILL: THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

1986
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
BOB CORKER IS A REPUBLICAN FROM

1987
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
TENNESSEE.

1988
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
MARTHA: YOU THINK ABOUT THE FEAR

1989
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
THAT WE COULD GO OVER THIS

1990
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
FISCAL CLIFF, AND THAT THE

1991
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
FUTURE LOOKS VERY DARK IF WE ARE

1992
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
NOT ABLE TO GET OUR HANDS AROUND

1993
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
THE DEBT THAT YOU ALL WERE JUST

1994
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
DISCUSSING.
NOW WE ARE LEARNING THAT ERIC

1995
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
CANTOR HAS TOLD THE CAUCUS THAT

1996
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
THERE WILL BE A VOTE LIKELY ON A

1997
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
REPUBLICAN FISCAL CLIFF TAX PLAN

1998
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
IN THE HOUSE THAT COULD COME

1999
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
THIS WEEK.

2000
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MOVE

2001
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
THE BALL ALONG TOO DRAMATICALLY

2002
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
IN THIS PICTURE, BECAUSE

2003
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE

2004
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
REPUBLICAN SIDE IN THE HOUSE IS

2005
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
GOING TO VOTE ON A DEAL THAT

2006
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
WOULD HAVE A LOT OF SPENDING

2007
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
CUTS IN IT AND IT'S SOMETHING

2008
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD BE

2009
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
UNLIKELY TO SIGN INTO LAW.

2010
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
WE ARE WAITING FOR JOHN BOEHNER

2011
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
TO COME IN RIGHT NOW.

2012
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
HE'LL BE WITH THE USUAL TEAM.

2013
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
KEVIN MCCARTHY WILL BE THERE,

2014
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
KATHY MCMORRIS, PEOPLE WORKING

2015
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
TO HOLD THE FISCAL LINE AND GET

2016
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
SPENDING CUTS, THEY WANT A

2017
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
MILLION DOLLAR CUT OFF FOR THE

2018
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
TAXES TO INCREASE.

2019
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
THAT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THAT

2020
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
MIGHT BE PALATABLE ON THE

2021
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
REPUBLICAN SIDE.

2022
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW IN TERMS OF

2023
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
THE LARGER REPUBLICAN HOUSE VOTE

2024
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
WHETHER OR NOT JOHN BOEHNER

2025
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
COULD GET THOSE VOTES BECAUSE
THERE ARE FOLKS IN THE HOUSE WHO

2026
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
WANT TO SEE ABSOLUTELY NO TAX

2027
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
INCREASES ON ANYBODY AS PART OF

2028
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
THIS DEAL.
SO IT IS QUITE ABREU THAT WE ARE

2029
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
WORKING ON HERE, AND BOB CORKER

2030
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
MAKES SIGNIFICANT POINTS FOR THE

2031
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
REPUBLICAN SIDE IN TERMS OF

2032
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
DOING SOMETHING THAT REALLY

2033
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
CREATES REFORM, THAT CHANGES THE

2034
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
SYSTEM, THAT WORKS ON MEDICARE,

2035
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
THAT WORKS ON SOCIAL SECURITY IN

2036
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
A WAY THAT WILL START TO IMPROVE

2037
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
OUR FISCAL SITUATION DOWN THE

2038
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
ROAD AND MIGHT GET US OUT OF THE

2039
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
WHOLE LONGER TERM.

2040
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
THAT IS WHAT SEEMS TO BE MISSING

2041
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
HERE.
BILL: IT'S DECEMBER 18th ON

2042
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
THE CALENDAR.
WE KNEW MONTHS AGO AT SOME POINT

2043
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
WE WERE GOING TO REACH CRUNCH

2044
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
TIME.
I DON'T THINK WE ARE AT THAT

2045
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
POINT YET.

2046
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
YOU CAN FEEL THE GEARS WORKING

2047
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
IN THAT DIRECTION AS OF TODAY,

2048
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
BECAUSE --
MARTHA: I THINK PEOPLE ARE SO

2049
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
FED UP WITH THIS PROCESS OF

2050
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
HAVING TO TAKE EVERYTHING TO THE

2051
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
LAST MINUTE TO GET IT DONE.

2052
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS, AND BOB

2053
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
BECKEL SAID IT EARLIER, WELL

2054
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
THERE IS JUST NO TIME RIGHT NOW

2055
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
TO DO TAX REFORM, THERE IS NO

2056
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
TIME TO DO ENTITLEMENT REFORMS,

2057
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
AND AMERICANS ARE TOLD TIME AND

2058
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
TIME AGAIN THAT THEY ARE OUT OF

2059
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
TIME.

2060
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS,

2061
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT YOU'RE TOO

2062
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
CLOSE TO THE NEXT ELECTION TO

2063
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
GET ANYTHING DONE, AND I JUST

2064
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
THINK THE FRUSTRATION LEVEL IS

2065
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
SO HUGE RIGHT NOW WITH ALL OF

2066
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
THIS.

2067
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
BILL: IF YOU PICK UP THE LINES

2068
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
OUT OF WASHINGTON SOME OF THE

2069
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
DEALS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

2070
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
TALKING ABOUT OVER THE PAST

2071
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
COUPLE OF DAYS WOULD SAVE THE

2072
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
COUNTRY $2 TRILLION OVER A

2073
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
PERIOD OF TEN YEARS, WHICH I

2074
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
MEAN $2 TRILLION, THAT IS A

2075
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY.

2076
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
BUT YET WHEN THE NATIONAL DEBT

2077
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
STANDS AT 16.3 TRILLION NOW AND

2078
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
IT'S STEADILY INCREASING AND

2079
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
GOES UP HIGHER POSSIBLY TO

2080
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
$20 TRILLION THREE OR FOUR YEARS

2081
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
AGO, WHAT DOES $2 TRILLION TEN

2082
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
YEARS AGO GET YOU?

2083
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
THAT'S WHAT MOVES CORKER AROUND

2084
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
TO HIS BIG IDEA, ABOUT DO 4,

2085
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
4 1/2, $5 TRILLION, TO A GRAND

2086
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
BARGAIN TO REDUCE THE SPENDING

2087
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
AND THE SPENDING THAT WE HAVE

2088
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
WATCHED GO UP INCREASINGLY BY

2089
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
THE MINUTE IN WASHINGTON.

2090
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
MARTHA: WE ARE GETTING

2091
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
INFORMATION FROM OUR PRODUCER ON

2092
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
THE HILL.

2093
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
BASICALLY HE'S HIGHLIGHTING WHAT

2094
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I JUST MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO.

2095
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IS

2096
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
GOING TO HAPPEN ON THE HOUSE

2097
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
REPUBLICAN SIDE EVEN.

2098
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW DIFFICULT

2099
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
THEY MAY BE HAVING AT RALLYING

2100
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
THE TROOPS IN TERMS OF EVEN A

2101
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
MILLION DOLLAR LEVEL FOR

2102
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
INCREASES ON TAXES BECAUSE THERE

2103
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
WILL BE, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THOSE

2104
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
TEA TEA PARTY REPUBLICANS AND

2105
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
THOSE HE COMMITTED TO NOT

2106
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
INCREASING TAXES AT ALL WILL

2107
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
THEY PUT AT RISK THEIR

2108
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
RE-ELECTION.

2109
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID THE REAL
ISSUE WILL BE THE DEBT CEILING,

2110
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
BECAUSE AS WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT

2111
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
WANTS A HANDS-OFF APPROACH TO

2112
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
THE DEBT CEILING.

2113
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO RAISE IT

2114
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
WHENEVER THEY THINK IT'S

2115
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
NECESSARY.

2116
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
WE'VE HEARD TIMOTHY GEITHNER

2117
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
TALK IN GREAT DETAIL ABOUT HOW

2118
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
WE CAN'T RISK THE CREDIBILITY OF

2119
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
THE U.S. DOLLAR, THE U.S.

2120
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
ECONOMY, THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

2121
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
AND HAVING THOSE DOWNGRADES COME

2122
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
IF WE DON'T RAISE THE DEBT

2123
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
LIMIT.
A LOT OF FOLKS ARE SAYING HOW

2124
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
CAN WE POSSIBLY ALLOW A

2125
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
LIMITLESS CREDIT CARD FOR THE

2126
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WITHOUT

2127
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
ANY CHECK ON THAT.

2128
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
A MAJOR ISSUE OF CONTENTION HERE

2129
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
AS WELL.
BOB CORKER -- I'M SURE HE IS

2130
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
RIGHT, THEY MAY BE VERY FAR

2131
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
APART ONCOMING TO ANY CONCLUSION

2132
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
AT ALL.

2133
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
BILL: SPEAKER BOEHNER HAS MET

2134
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
WITH MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY.

2135
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
WE SHOULD SEE HIM IN A MATTER OF

2136
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
MOMENTS.
LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK HERE,

2137
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
WE'LL BRING THIS TO YOU AFTER A

2138
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,000
COMMERCIAL AT TIME OUT.
I ALWAYS WAIT
UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE.

2139
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
CAN I STILL SHIP A GIFT
IN TIME R CHRISTMAS?

2140
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
YEAH, SURE YOU CAN.
GREAT.

2141
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
WHERE'S YOUR GIFT?

2142
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
UH...

2143
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000

MARTHA: WE ARE BACK AND WE ARE

2148
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
WAITING FOR JOHN BOEHNER TO

2149
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
SURFACE IN THAT ROOM AND TALK

2150
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
ABOUT WHERE THIS IS GOING WITH

2151
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
THE FISCAL CLIFF NEGOTIATIONS.

2152
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
STEVE HAYES IS WITH ME NOW WITH

2153
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
"THE WEEKLY STANDARD" AND FOX

2154
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

2155
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
HOW IS THIS GOING.

2156
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
>> I THINK OUR FOCUSED ON

2157
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
EXACTLY THE RIGHT QUESTION.

2158
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
WHAT DID SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER

2159
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
SAY TO HIS CONFERENCE THAT WOULD

2160
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
ALLOW HIS PEOPLE TO ACCEPT SOME

2161
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
KIND OF A GRAND BARGAIN WHICH

2162
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
SEEMS TO BE WHAT HE WOULD PREFER

2163
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,000
AT THIS POINT.
THERE IS DEEP SKEPTICISM AMONG

2164
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
THE CONSERVATIVES IN THE HOUSE

2165
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
OF REPRESENTATIVES WHO SAY WE

2166
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
ARE NOT VOTING FOR TAX INCREASES

2167
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,000
NOT BECAUSE WE ARE BEING OBJECT

2168
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
STA NAT, WE AGREE IN PRINCIPLE

2169
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO RAISE

2170
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
TAXES AND GOVERNMENT IS SPENDING

2171
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
TOO MUCH, THAT IS THE BIG

2172
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
PROBLEM.

2173
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DEAL IN

2174
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
TERMS .
OUTLINE THAT WE ARE GETTING OF

2175
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
IT, NO INCREASE IN THE MEDICARE

2176
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
AGE WHICH MANY PEOPLE THINK IS

2177
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
REASONABLE, NOT TO RAISE IT

2178
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
RIGHT NOW BUT DOWN THE ROAD

2179
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
WHICH ECHOES THE PAUL RYAN PLAN

2180
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
AS ONE OF HIS ELEMENTS, RAISE

2181
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
THE RATE FOR FOLKS UNDER 55

2182
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
RIGHT NOW, NOT EVEN A COMPROMISE

2183
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
ON THAT YET, STEVE.

2184
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
>> I THINK THIS IS THE

2185
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM.

2186
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
WHATEVER WE SEE COME OUT OF

2187
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
THESE FISCAL CLIFF NEGOTIATIONS

2188
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
IT'S ALMOST CERTAIN NOT TO GET

2189
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
TO THE HEART OF THE REAL

2190
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
PROBLEM.

2191
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
THE DRIVERS OF OUR DEBT ARE

2192
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
ENTITLEMENTS, WE ARE TALKING

2193
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
ABOUT SPENDING 60% OF OUR BUDGET

2194
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
ON ENTITLEMENTS ON A HANDFUL OF

2195
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
PROGRAMS THAT ARE -- THAT THE

2196
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
SPENDING IS AUTOMATIC.

2197
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
WE DON'T CONTROL IT FROM YEAR TO

2198
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
YEAR.
UNLESS YOU DRAMATICALLY REFORM

2199
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
THOSE PROGRAMS YOU'RE NOT GOING

2200
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
TO GET IN FRONT OF THE DEBT

2201
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
PROBLEM THAT THE COUNTRY FACES.

2202
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO

2203
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE

2204
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
U.S. NATIONAL DEBT.

2205
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
AND UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU DO THAT

2206
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
ALL YOU'RE DOING IS SORT OF

2207
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
MEDDLING AT THE MARGINS.

2208
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
MARTHA: THIS SORT OF DISTASTE ON

2209
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
THE DEMOCRAT'S SIDE FOR TAKE ON

2210
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
THIS ISSUE IN ANY MEANINGFUL

2211
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
WAY, I JUST WONDER, YOU KNOW, DO

2212
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
THEY LOOK AT IT AND SAY, WELL,

2213
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,000
NOW, IT WON US A PRESIDEN

2214
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION PROMISING

2215
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
WE WON'T TOUCH ANY

2216
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
ENTITLEMENTS.

2217
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
BUT WHERE IS THE FOR SIGHT,

2218
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
LOOKING DOWN THE ROAD?

2219
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I THINK PEOPLE ARE SO

2220
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
DISTRUSTFUL NOW OF CONGRESS'

2221
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
ABILITY TO GET ANYTHING DONE

2222
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
THAT WILL CHANGE THE COURSE OF

2223
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
WHERE WE ARE HEADED IN THIS

2224
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
COUNTRY LONG TERM.

2225
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
>> YEAH THEY SHOULD BE

2226
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
DISTRUSTFUL.
THAT IS PART OF THE PROBLEM IS

2227
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
THAT CONGRESS REFUSES TO TAKE

2228
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
THESE ISSUES SERIOUSLY.

2229
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
IT'S NOT JUST CONGRESS.

2230
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
REMEMBER, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS THE

2231
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

2232
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
AND HE RAN THE FIRST TIME SAYING

2233
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
THAT HE WAS GOING TO GET IN

2234
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
FRONT OF THESE ISSUES THAT HE

2235
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
WAS GOING --

2236
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
MARTHA: LINE-BY-LINE HE WAS

2237
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
GOING TO GO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE

2238
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
PROGRAM.

2239
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
>> EXACTLY.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE COMMENTS HE

2240
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
MADE IN THE VERY FIRST MONTH OF

2241
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
HIS PRESIDENCY BACK IN 2009 HE

2242
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
SAID THAT THE CENTRAL PARK TO

2243
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
GETTING IN FRONT OF THE U.S.

2244
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
SPENDING PROBLEM IS GOING TO BE

2245
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
TACKLING ENTITLEMENTS.

2246
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
AND HE HASN'T DONE THAT.

2247
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
THE ONLY INDICATIONS THAT HE'S

2248
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
GIVEN AT ALL THAT HE WAS WILLING

2249
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
TO CONTEMPLATE THIS CAME IN THE

2250
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
CONTEXT OF THE DEBT CEILING

2251
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
NEGOTIATIONS AND EVEN THOSE THE

2252
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
WHITE HOUSE REFUSED REPEATEDLY

2253
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
TO PUT ON PAPER, TO BE SPECIFIC

2254
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
ABOUT.

2255
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
SO HE HASN'T BEEN SERIOUS ABOUT

2256
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
THIS.
AND I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY THIS

2257
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
IS A PROBLEM OF LEADERSHIP AT

2258
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL.

2259
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
MARTHA: ALL RIGHT.

2260
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
THEY ARE COMING OUT NOW, STEVE.

2261
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
THANKS A LOT.

2262
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
LET'S LISTEN TO THIS AND GET

2263
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT LATER.

2264
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
>> GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.

2265
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
OUR HOPE CONTINUES TO BE TO

2266
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE

2267
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
PRESIDENT ON A BALANCED APPROACH

2268
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
THAT AVERTS THE FISCAL CLIFF.

2269
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
WHAT WE'VE OFFERED MEETS THE

2270
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
DEFINITION OF BALANCE, BUT THE

2271
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
PRESIDENT IS NOT THERE YET.

2272
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
THE WHITE HOUSE OFFERED

2273
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
YESTERDAY ESSENTIALLY A

2274
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
$1.3 TRILLION IN NEW REVENUES

2275
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:51,000
FOR ONLY $850 BILLION IN NET

2276
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
SPENDING REDUCTIONS.
THAT IS NOT BALANCED IN MY

2277
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
OPINION.
SO AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE GOING

2278
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
TO CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THE

2279
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
PRESIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO ALSO

2280
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
MOVE PLAN B.

2281
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT EVERY

2282
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
INCOME TAX FILER IN AMERICA IS

2283
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
GOING TO PAY HIGHER RATES COME

2284
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
JANUARY THE 1st UNLESS

2285
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
CONGRESS ACTS.

2286
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
SO I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

2287
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
WE PROTECT AS MANY AMERICAN

2288
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
TAXPAYERS AS WE CAN.

2289
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
AND OUR PLAN B WOULD PROTECT

2290
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
AMERICAN TAXPAYERS WHO MAKE A

2291
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
MILLION DOLLARS OR LESS AND HAVE

2292
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
ALL OF THEIR CURRENT RATES

2293
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
EXTENDED.
I CONTINUE TO HAVE HOPE THAT WE

2294
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
CAN REACH A BROADER AGREEMENT

2295
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
WITH THE WHITE HOUSE THAT WOULD

2296
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
REDUCE SPENDING AS WELL AS HAVE

2297
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
REVENUES ON THE TABLE.

2298
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR

2299
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
OUR COUNTRY, BUT AT THIS POINT

2300
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
HAVING A BACK UP PLAN TO MAKE

2301
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
SURE THAT AS FEW AMERICAN

2302
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
TAXPAYERS ARE AFFECTED BY THIS

2303
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
INCREASE AS POSSIBLE, MOVING

2304
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
DOWN THAT PATH IS THE RIGHT

2305
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
COURSE OF ACTION FOR US.

2306
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
>> GOOD MORNING.

2307
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO SAY

2308
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
THAT I THINK ALL OF OUR HEARTS

2309
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
AND PRAYERS ARE WITH THE

2310
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
FAMILIES IN NEWTOWN,

2311
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
CONNECTICUT.

2312
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
AS A FATHER I CANNOT EVEN

2313
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
IMAGINE THE UTTER HORROR THAT

2314
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
THOSE FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH

2315
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
RIGHT NOW GRIEVING THE LOSS OF

2316
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,000
THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR LOVED

2317
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
ONES.
AS FAR AS THE FISCAL CLIFF IS

2318
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
CONCERNED AS THE SPEAKER SAID WE

2319
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
REMAIN COMMITTED TO TRYING TO

2320
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
MINIMIZE THE IMPACT ON

2321
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
HARD-WORKING FAMILIES AND SMALL

2322
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
BUSINESSES IN THIS COUNTRY, AS

2323
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
FAR AS TAX INCREASES ARE

2324
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
CONCERNED.
WE LOOK TO FIND THE ANSWER TO

2325
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
SOLVE THE PROBLEM ON THE

2326
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
SPENDING ISSUE HERE IN

2327
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
WASHINGTON.

2328
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT YET THERE,

2329
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
HE HAS NOT COME TO WHERE HE

2330
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
NEEDS TO BE IN ORDER FOR US TO

2331
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
PUSH THROUGH A BILL THAT REALLY

2332
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
DOES BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE

2333
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
PROBLEM.

2334
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
AND AS THE SPEAKER SAID, THAT'S

2335
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
WHY WE ARE NOW DISCUSSING AND

2336
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
ALTERNATIVE PLAN IF THE

2337
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE

2338
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
CANNOT COME OUR WAY.

2339
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
THANK YOU.

2340
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
>> AS THE SPEAKER AND THE LEADER

2341
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
SAID, WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE

2342
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
SURE WE DO NOT GO OFF THIS

2343
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
FISCAL CLIFF.

2344
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PUT

2345
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
AMERICA ON A DIFFERENT PATH, ONE

2346
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
FOR JOB CREATION, ONE THAT ALSO

2347
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
TAKES CARE OF OUR SPENDING.

2348
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I THINK MANY TIMES THE SPEAKER

2349
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
FELT THAT MAYBE HE WAS

2350
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
NEGOTIATING WITH HIMSELF.

2351
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
AFTER PLAN, AFTER PLAN WHERE THE

2352
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
PRESIDENT STAYED SILENT.

2353
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
THOSE THREE WEEKS RIGHT AFTER

2354
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
THE ELECTION WHEN THE FIRST IDEA

2355
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
WAS SENT ACROSS FROM THE

2356
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
PRESIDENT TO THE SPEAKER WE

2357
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
HEARD NOTHING BUT SILENCE.

2358
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
UNFORTUNATELY TODAY WE ARE GOING

2359
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
TO HAVE TO GO TO PLAN B.

2360
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE

2361
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
DO NOT GO OFF THE CLIFF AND WE

2362
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP

2363
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
AN ECONOMY WHERE JOBS CAN BE

2364
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
CREATED.

2365
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
BUT THE THING WE HAVE TO

2366
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
REMEMBER IS WHERE WE ARE IN THE

2367
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
SITUATION.

2368
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
WE ARE TWO MONTHS INTO A NEW

2369
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
FISCAL YEAR.

2370
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
WE SHOULD ALWAYS LOOK AT THE

2371
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
NUMBERS, BECAUSE THEY CAN TELL

2372
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
YOU IN A SCENARIO WHERE WE ARE.

2373
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
IN TWO MONTHS WE ARE

2374
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
$292 BILLION IN DEBT.

2375
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
WHEN YOU READ THE NUMBERS THERE

2376
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
IS SOME POSITIVE NEWS IN IT,

2377
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
REVENUES ARE UP BY 10%,

2378
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
$30 BILLION.
THAT IS 1 BILLION LESS THAN

2379
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
YOU'D GET IF YOU JUST RAISED THE

2380
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
TOP TWO RATES FOR THE FIRST

2381
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
YEAR.

2382
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
BUT THE SAD REALITY IS SPENDING

2383
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
IS UP 16%.

2384
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
$87BILLION.

2385
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
THAT IS WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES,

2386
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
THAT'S WHERE THE PRESIDENT HAS

2387
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
TO START TALKING ABOUT AND

2388

WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT.

2476
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
WITH A PERSON AS EVERYBODY HAS

2477
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
BEEN SAYING THAT IS POSSIBLY

2481
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE

2482
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
EVIDENCE THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT

2483
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
ALREADY, BILL REAL QUICKLY THE

2484
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
POLICE HAVE SAID THAT THEY HAVE

2485
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
VERY GOOD EVIDENCE.

01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
WHAT COULD THAT VERY GOOD

2487
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000

THAT COMPUTER HARD DRIVE WHAT

2489
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
THEY WILL FIND ONCE THEY ARE

2490
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
ABLE TO GET INTO IT IS THAT THIS

2491
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
GUY HAD BEEN RESEARCHING A LOT

2492
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
OF THE ACTIVITY SURROUNDING THE

2493
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
AURORA, COLORADO SHOOTING AND

2494
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
SPECIFICALLY THE MINDSET OF

2495
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
JAMES HOLMES WHO WAS THE SHOOTER

2496
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
WHO HAD A VERY SIMILAR MINDSET

2497
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
TO THIS GUY LANZA LAST WEEK.

2498
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
BILL: ARE YOU SAYING THAT, OR DO

2499
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
YOU HAVE THAT ON AUTHORITY?

2500
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
>> NO, NO, NO --

2501
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
BILL: THAT IS YOUR THEORY.

2502
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
>> THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVE.

2503
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
THIS IS JUST A THEORY.

2504
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVE.

2505
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
IF YOU LOOK AT BOTH OF THESE

2506
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR MINDSETS

2507
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR.

2508
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
NOW WHY THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

2509
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
BILL?

2510
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
THAT IS A QUESTION THAT

2511
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
EVERYBODY HAS BEEN ASKING.

2512
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
NOW JUST YESTERDAY THE POLICE

2513
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000

2514
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
CONNECTION BETWEEN LANZA AND THE

2515
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, BUT HERE IS

2516
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
THE CORRELATION RIGHT HERE.

2517
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
WHERE WILL YOU FIND A LARGE

2518
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
NUMBER OF CHILDREN TOGETHER ON A

2519
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
FRIDAY MORNING?

2520
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

2521
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
HOW DO YOU AFFECT THE FABRIC,

2522
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
THE CORE OF THIS NATION

2523
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
ESPECIALLY THE ADULTS, YOU

2524
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
ATTACK THE CHILDREN.

2525
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
THAT IS THE SAME MINDSET, BILL

2526
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
THAT THE COLORADO SHOOTER HAD.

2527
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
BILL: NOW HOLD ON NOW, OKAY.

2528
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000

FROM THE SCHOOL.

2530
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
THERE ARE OTHER SCHOOLS ALONG

2531
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
THAT ROAD THAT YOU KNOW OF.

2532
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
>> RIGHT.
BILL: THEY HAVE SAID THAT ADAM

2533
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
LANZA HAS NO CONNECTION TO THE

2534
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000

THEY HAVE NOT DEFINED WHAT THE

2535
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000

2536
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000

TWO SOURCES CLOSE TO THE POLICE

2539
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
DEPARTMENT SAID SHE VOLUNTEERED

2540
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
AT THE SCHOOL.
I TALKED TO POLICE IN

2541
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
CONNECTICUT AS WELL AND I ASKED

2542
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
ABOUT THE HARD DRIVE.

2543
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
THEY WOULD NOT CONFIRM ANY OF

2544
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
THIS INFORMATION THAT IS BEING

2545
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
REPORTED TODAY.

2546
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
>> RIGHT.
BUT YOU KNOW, HE WAS FAMILIAR, I

2547
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
THINK, BILL, AND YOU MAY KNOW

2548
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
FROM BEING UP THERE THE PAST

2549
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
COUPLE OF DAYS, BUT IT'S BEEN

2550
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
REPORTED THAT HE WAS FAMILIAR

2551
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
WITH THAT SCHOOL.

2552
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THAT AREA,

2553
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
AND TYPICALLY, BILL, IN A

2554
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS THE SHOOTER,

2555
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
ESPECIALLY AN ACTIVE SHOOTER

2556
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
WILL GO TO A PLACE THAT THEY ARE

2557
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR W. WHY?

2558
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO

2559
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
PLAN THEIR ESCAPE AT THE SAME

2560
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
TIME.

2561
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I THINK ALL OF THESE FACETS,

2562
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
ONCE THEY COME TOGETHER, WE

2563
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
GOING TO SEE A STRIKING

2564
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
SIMILARITY TO THE AURORA

2565
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000

2566
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
BILL: WE WILL WATCH ALL THAT AND

2567
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000

01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,000
BEING HELD THAT WAY?

2590
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000

THEY SPECIFICALLY STATE THAT HE

2593
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
IS BEING CHAINED BECAUSE OF HIS

2594
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
MILITARY EXPERIENCE.

2595
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000

2608
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
JOHN HAMMER APPEARS TO BE

2609
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
UNHARMED IN THIS IMAGE, BUT THE

2610
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000

01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000

2619
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000

THEY WERE ON THE WAY TO HUNT AND

MEXICAN AUTHORITIES SAID THE

2649
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
BARREL WAS TOO SHORT UNDER THE

2650
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000

THAT'S WHY JOHN WAS ARRESTED.

2675
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
THERE IS A LETTER FROM THE U.S.

2676

GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE FELONY

2680
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
HE WAS DETAINED FOR.

CONSIDERED A SERIOUS OFFENSE.

2685
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT ALSO SAYS

2686
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
AMERICANS ARE ARRESTED IN

2687
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000

MORE YEARS IN A MEXICAN PRISON

2694
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000

01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
>> I DON'T SEE THAT HE'LL BE

2712
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
HOME FOR CHRISTMAS AT ALL.

2713
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I THINK, YOU KNOW, THE EARLIER

2714
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000

01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
EXPECT ANY ACTION TO BE TAKEN

2717
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
UNTIL THEN.

2718
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
MARTHA: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS

2719
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
CASE, KULLY?

2720
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000

2721
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
MARTHA: LET'S GO TO KULLY

2722
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
FIRST.

2723
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
>> THANKS, MARTHA IT'S A

2724
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
TRAGEDY.
FROM WHAT I'VE READ HE ACTUALLY

2725
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,000
TRIED TO SPEAK WITH U.S. CUSTOM

2726
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
AND BORDER PATROL AGENTS BEFORE

2727
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
HE CROSSED THE MEXICAN BORDER TO

2728
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
MAKE SURE IT WAS OKAY TO BRING

2729
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
THIS 24-INCH, 410 SHOTGUN

2730
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
TRANSIT THROUGH MEXICO TO GO

2731
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
SURFING DOWN IN COSTA RICA, HE

2732
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
CLEARLY HAD NO ILL INTENT.

2733
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
I AGREE WITH MY COGUEST THAT IT

2734
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE WILL BE

2735
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
ANY ACTION EXCEPT FOR THE COURT

2736
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
ACTION IN JANUARY.

2737
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
THE ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO DO

2738
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
MORE QUIETLY BEHIND THE SCENES

2739
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
TO MAKE SURE HE'S PROVIDED THE

2740
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
COUNSELOR SERVICES HE DESERVES

2741
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
AND HAS A RIGHT TO HAVE

2742
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
ESPECIALLY AS A COMBAT DECORATED

2743
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
MARINE.
MARTHA: IS IT TYPICAL FOR THIS

2744
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,000
KIND OF VIOLATION TO GARNER THIS

2745
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
KIND OF PRISON SENTENCE AND THIS

2746
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
KIND OF TREATMENT.

2747
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
HE'S SHIRTLESS AND KHEUPBD TO A

2748
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
BED, REALLY?
FOR BRINGING AN UNREGISTERED GUN

2749
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
ACROSS THE BORDER?

2750
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
LOOK AT FAST AND FURIOUS WE'VE

2751
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
SEEN GUNS FLY ACROSS THIS BORDER

2752
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
AND NOBODY SEEMS TO PAY THE

2753
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
PRICE EXCEPT FOR SOME PEOPLE

2754
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,000
THAT LOST THEIR LIVES IN THAT

2755
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
TRANSACTION.

2756
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
>> LET'S BE CLEAR THE CONDITIONS

2757
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
IN MEXICAN JAILS ARE

2758
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
DEPLORABLE.

2759
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
THEY ADDRESS THE EUPL PROCEDUR

2760
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
THE IMPORTATION OF WEAPONS AS

2761
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
DESCRIBED BY THE AMBASSADOR.

2762
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
THE INTENTION OF THIS AMERICAN

2763
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
WAS NOT TO VIOLATE MEXICAN

2764
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
IMMIGRATION LAW.
WHAT I FIND EVEN MORE DEPLORABLE

2765
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
IS THAT THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT

2766
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:47,000
WILL BE VERY -- VERY HARSH ON

2767
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
ANY TREATMENT OF THEIR MEXICAN

2768
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
CITIZENS EVEN IF THEY ENTER THE

2769
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AND VIOLATE

2770
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
THE LAW WITHIN TENSION.

2771
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT GOES

2772
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
TO SAY THAT THERE WAS NO INTENT

2773
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
ON MR. HAMMER TO VIOLATE THE LAW

2774
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
AS HE ENTERED MEXICO, HE TRIED

2775
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
TO DECLARE THE WEAPON.

2776
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
YET I WILL TELL YOU THAT MEXICAN

2777
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
PROSECUTORS WILL NOT BACK OFF

2778
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE INTENT OF

2779
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
MR. HAMMER WAS.

2780
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
MARTHA: ALL RIGHT.
SO YOU LOOK FOR A WAY TO DEAL

2781
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:16,000
WITH THIS PROBLEM IN WASHINGTON,

2782
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
DIPLOMATICALLY BEHIND CLOSED

2783
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
DOORS SO IT DOESN'T BECOME

2784
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
SOMETHING THAT HA IS AN EPL BAR

2785
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
A ASment TO THE MEXICAN

2786
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
GOVERNMENT IF THEY APPEAR TO

2787
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
BACK DOWN ON THE CHARGES AGAINST

2788
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
THIS YOUNG MAN.

2789
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FOR HIS

2790
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
FAMILY TO PURSUE THIS AND WHAT

2791
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
DO YOU THINK IS THE BEST WAY FOR

2792
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
THE THE GOVERNMENT TO HANDLE

2793
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,000
IT?
STPHREU THINK TH

2794
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
>> I THINK THE FAMILY IS DOING

2795
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
THE RIGHT THING.

2796
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
GET ON THE MEDIA, CONTACT THE

2797
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
REPRESENTATIVES.

2798
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
REPRESENTATIVES HAVE WRITTEN THE

2799
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
SOAK OF STATE IN THE UNITED

2800
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
STATES AND THE MEDIA NEEDS TO

2801
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
KEEP ON THIS STORY.

2802
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
IF THERE IS A PLEA IN JANUARY OR

2803
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
SHORTLY THERE AFTER OR A

2804
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
CONVICTION AFTER A TRIAL IT'S AT

2805
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
THAT POINT WHEN HE'S SENTENCED

2806
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,000
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE

2807
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
UNITED STATES HAS THE MOST

2808
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
LEVERAGE, THEY CAN SAY, LOOK YOU

2809
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
GOT YOUR POUND OF FLESH, YOU

2810
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
PROSECUTED HIM, THAT SENTENCE IS

2811
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
WAY TOO LONG.

2812
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
WE'LL TAKE CARE THE SITUATION

2813
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
AND BRING HIM HOME.

2814
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
JUSTICE IS SERVED, NOW IT'S TIME

2815
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
TO BRING HIM HOME.

2816
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
I THINK PRESSURE REALLY

2817
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
MATTERSES ESPECIALLY BEHIND THE

2818
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
SCENES.
IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT REALLY

2819
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
WANTED THIS GUY HOME THEY COULD

2820
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
DO A LOT TO PRESSURE THE MEXICAN

2821
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
GOVERNMENT BEHIND THE SCENES TO

2822
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
MAKE IT HAPPEN SOME TIME IN

2823
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
JANUARY.
MARTHA: WE'LL STAY ON IT.

2824
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US

2825
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
TODAY.

2826
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
BILL: A NIGHT OF HEAVY DRINKING

2827
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
AND A 19-YEAR-OLD IS FOUND

2828
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
DEAD.

2829
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
NOW MEMBERS OF A COLLEGE

2830
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
FRATERNITY ARE FACING CHARGES,

2831
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
AND SOME OF THOSE CHARGES ARE

2832
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
EVEN FELONIES.

2833
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
>> HE WANTED TO BE LIKED.

2834
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
HE WANTED TO BE ACCEPTED.

2835
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
THE TERMS THAT THE FRATERNITY

2836
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
PLACED ON HIM IS THAT HE HAD TO

2837
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
GO THROUGH THIS.

2838
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
>> HE HAD TO DRINK?

2839
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:51,000
>> YES.
COPD makes it hard
to breathe,

2840
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:53,000
but with ADVAIR,
I'm breathing better.

2841
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,000
So now I can be in
the scene.

2842
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
ADVAIR is
clinically proven to help

2843
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
significantly improve

2844
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
lung function.

2845
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Unlike most COPD medications,

2846
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
ADVAIR contains both an
anti-inflammatory

2847
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
and a
long-acting bronchodilator

2848
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
working together to help improve
your lung function all day.

2849
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
ADVAIR won't
replace fast-acting inhalers

2850
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
for sudden symptoms

2851
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
and should not be used more
than twice a day.

2852
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
People with
COPD taking ADVAIR

2853
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
may have a higher chance
of pneumonia.

2854
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
ADVAIR may increase your
risk of osteoporosis

2855
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
and some eye problems.

2856
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Tell your doctor
if you have a heart condition

2857
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
or high blood pressure before
taking ADVAIR.

2858
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
If you're still
having difficulty breathing,

2859
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
ask your doctor if including
ADVAIR could help

2860
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
improve your lung function.

2861
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000

MARTHA: OUT OF THE SADNESS IN

2866
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT WE ARE

2867
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000

2868
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
STORY.

2869
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,000
THIS MAN LIVES NEAR SANDY HOOK

2870
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND HE'S

2871
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
SPEAKING OUT ABOUT HIS
EXPERIENCE OF COMING HOME AND

2872
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
FINDING SIX SMALL CHILDREN

2873
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
SITTING IN A SEMI CIRCLE ON HIS

2874
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
LAWN.
HE HAD HEARD THE GUNFIRE ON HIS

2875
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
WAY BACK FROM BREAKFAST AT A

2876
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
LOCAL DINER AND HE THOUGHT IT

2877
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
WAS A HUNTER, THEN HE SAW THESE

2878
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
CHILDREN SITTING ON HIS FRONT

2879
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
LAWN.
HE STARTED TO TALK TO THEM, GAVE

2880
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
HIM JUICE AND TOYS AND THEY

2881
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
RECOUNTED WHAT HAD HAPPENED .

2882
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
LISTEN TO THIS.

2883
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
>> OVER THE NEXT 30 MINUTES THEY

2884
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
JUST DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED,

2885
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
LITTLE BY LITTLE, AND THESE TWO

2886
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
BOYS KEPT SAYING, WE CAN'T GO

2887
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
BACK TO SCHOOL, WE CAN'T GO BACK

2888
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
TO SCHOOL.

2889
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
OUR TEACHER IS DEED.

2890
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
MRS. SOTO, WE DON'T HAVE A

2891
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
TEACHER.
AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT.

2892
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
I COULDN'T TAKE THAT IN.

2893
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT HAD

2894
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,000
HAPPENED.
MARTHA: SO, SO, SO SAD.

2895
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
AND LISTENING TO HIS STORY, AND

2896
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
HE SAID AT FIRST HE SAW THEM ON

2897
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
THE LAWN I THOUGHT THEY WERE

2898
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
PUTTING ON APPLY OR SOMETHING.

2899
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
HE WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

2900
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,000
THEY COULD POSSIBLY BE DOING ON

2901
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
HIS FRONT LAWN.

2902
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
WE ALL KNOW HOW CHILDREN FEEL

2903
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
ABOUT HIS TEACHER, IT IS THE

2904
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN THEIR

01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000

THE CHILDREN THAT GO TO THE

01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000

LET'S TURN OUR ATTENTION NOW,

2926
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
