00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
SHE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ONE OF

187
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
THE TOP MEMBERS OF MY NATIONAL

188
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
SECURITY TEAM.

189
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
>> Reporter: RICE HAD BECOME THE
DESIGNATED OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

190
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
TARGET FOR REPUBLICANS SEEKING

191
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
ANSWERS AND/OR POLITICAL

192
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
ADVANTAGE, RELATING TO THE

193
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER

194
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
11th, 2012, ON THE DIPLOMATIC

195
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
COMPOUND IN BENGHAZI, LIBYA.

196
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
>> IN FACT, WHAT THIS BEGAN AS

197
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
WAS A SPONTANEOUS, NOT A

198
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
PREMEDITATED RESPONSE.

199
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
>> Reporter: FIVE DAYS AFTER

200
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
THOSE ATTACKS, RICE WENT ON THE

201
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
SUNDAY SHOWS, REPEATING TALKING

202
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
POINTS FROM THE INTELLIGENCE

203
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
COMMUNITY, THAT CRITICS SAID

204
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
DOWNPLAYED THE TERRORIST ATTACK

205
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
IN THE WEEKS LEADING UP TO THE

206
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
ELECTION.

207
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
>> I DIDN'T MISLEAD.

208
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I DIDN'T MISREPRESENT.

209
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I DID THE BEST WITH THE

210
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
INFORMATION THE UNITED STATES

211
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
GOVERNMENT HAD AT THE TIME.

212
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
>> Reporter: DEMOCRATS POINT OUT

213
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
THAT REPUBLICANS DIDN'T HAVE AS

214
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
HARD A TIME WITH A DIFFERENT

215
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER NAMED

216
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
RICE WHO HAD DIFFERENT

217
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
INACCURATE TALKING POINTS FROM

218
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

219
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
THAT WAS CONDOLEEZZA RICE,

220
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
TALKING ABOUT IRAQI WEAPONS OF

221
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
MASS DESTRUCTION THAT DIDN'T
EXIST.

222
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
THAT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME.

223
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
GEORGE?

224
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
>> YES, IT WAS, JAKE, THANKS

225
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
VERY MUCH.

226
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
>>> LET'S GET MORE ON THIS FROM
OUR SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

227
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
CORRESPONDENT, MARTHA RADDATZ.

228
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
AND MARTHA RADDATZ, NOW IN LINE

229
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
TO BE NAMED SECRETARY OF STATE,

230
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
SENATOR JOHN KERRY OF

231
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
MASSACHUSETTS.

232
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
HE'S LIKELY TO BE EASILY

233
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
CONFIRMED.

234
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
BUT THIS IS STILL A PAINFUL,

235
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
PERSONAL RETREAT FOR BOTH THE
PRESIDENT AND AMBASSADOR RICE.

236
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
>> Reporter: IT'S TRUE, GEORGE.

237
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
YOU KNOW,

238
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT KINDS OF

239
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
CHOICES, VERY DIFFERENT KINDS OF

240
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
STYLE.

241
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
KERRY'S SAFE, LOW-KEY,
EVEN-KEELED AND HAS LOTS OF

242
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
EXPERIENCE.

243
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
SUSAN RICE HAS LOTS OF

244
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
EXPERIENCE IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS.

245
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
BUT SHE'S FAR MORE COMBATIVE AND

246
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
IN YOUR FACE.

247
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
SHE WAS SEEN AS A RISKIER
CHOICE.

248
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
AND RIGHT NOW, THE PRESIDENT

249
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
DOESN'T WANT TO BATTLE OVER
PEOPLE.

250
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
HE'LL BATTLE OVER POLICY, BUT

251
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
NOT PEOPLE.

252
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
>> THAT'S WHAT THE AMBASSADOR
SAID, AS WELL.

253
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
THAT'S WHY SHE PULLED HERSELF

254
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
OUT.

255
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
MEANWHILE, WE'RE SEEING THE

256
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
CHALLENGES CONTINUE TO MOUNT FOR
THE PRESIDENT OVERSEAS,

257
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
ESPECIALLY IN SYRIA.

258
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
THAT CRISIS CONTINUING TO

259
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
ESCALATE.

260
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
WE LEARNED OVERNIGHT THAT THE
UNITED STATES WILL BE SENDING

261
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
MORE FIREPOWER TO THE REGION.

262
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
>> Reporter: THEY WILL.

263
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
TWO PATRIOT ROUNDS TO PREVENT

264
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
ROUNDS FROM CROSSING THE BOARD

265
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
WITH TURKEY.

266
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
THAT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST.

267
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
BUT THIS IS REALLY A SYMBOLIC

268
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
SHOW OF FORCE, TO SIGNAL SUPPORT

269
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
OF TURKEY AND TO PUT MORE
PRESSURE ON SYRIA.

270
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
BUT IT DOES REQUIRE ABOUT 400

271
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
TROOPS TO OPERATE THOSE SYSTEMS.

272
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
THAT WILL TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO

273
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
GET THERE, GEORGE.

274
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
>> OKAY, MARTHA RADDATZ, THANKS

275
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
VERY MUCH.

276
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
>>> LET'S STAY IN WASHINGTON NOW

277
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
AND MOVE ON TO THE LATEST ON THE

278
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
FISCAL CLIFF.

279
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
JUST 18 DAYS BEFORE EVERYONE'S

280
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
TAXES GO UP.

281
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
EVERY FEDERAL PROGRAM SET TO BE

282
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
CUT.

283
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
ABC'S JON KARL COVERS THAT FOR

284
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
US FROM CAPITOL HILL.

285
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
AND, JON, THE PRESIDENT AND

286
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
HOUSE SPEAKER BOEHNER MET AGAIN

287
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
LAST NIGHT.

288
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
IT WAS LESS THAN AN HOUR.

289
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY'RE
MAKING MUCH PROGRESS.

290
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
>> Reporter: NO, NOT AT ALL.

291
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
NO SIGNS OF PROGRESS AT ALL UP

292
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
HERE, GEORGE.

293
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
BOTH SIDES EMERGED FROM THAT

294
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
MEETING, CALLING IT FRANK.

295
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
NOW, YOU KNOW IN INTERNATIONAL

296
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
POLITICS, WHEN THE SIDES

297
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
DESCRIBE A MEETING AS FRANK, IT

298
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
USUALLY MEANS THEY VEHEMENTLY

299
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
DISAGREED OR THEY'RE ON THE

300
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
VERGE OF WAR.
I TALKED TO A PROMINENT HOUSE

301
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
DEMOCRAT LATE LAST NIGHT WHO

302
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
TOLD ME, SIMPLY, GET YOUR
PARACHUTE READY.

303
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
WE'RE GOING OVER THE CLIFF.

304
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
MEANWHILE, I CAN TELL YOU,

305
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
GEORGE, CONGRESS IS PRETTY MUCH,

306
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
YOU KNOW, A DESERT RIGHT NOW.

307
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
BOTH CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS ON

308
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
BOTH SIDES OF THE CAPITOL GOING

309
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
HOME FOR THE WEEKEND.

310
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
NO SIGNS OF REALLY ANYTHING
GOING ON HERE.

311
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
>> AS WE'RE CLOSING IN, JUST 18

312
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
DAYS TO GO,

313
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT BOTH SIDES

314
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
MUST HAVE FALLBACK PLANS IN

315
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
PLACE IF THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE

316
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
A DEAL.

317
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
>> Reporter: WELL, CERTAINLY, NO

318
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
PROSPECTS OF A MAJOR DEFICIT

319
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
DEAL.

320
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
ONE KIND OF A FALLBACK PLAN,

321
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
REPUBLICANS ARE TALKING ABOUT,

322
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
IS THAT THEY WOULD AGREE TO
EXTEND WHATEVER TAX CUTS THEY

323
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
CAN.

324
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
THAT MEANS THE MIDDLE-CLASS TAX

325
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
CUTS THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO

326
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
EXTEND.
BUT DO NOTHING ELSE.

327
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
THAT MEANS A BIG BATTLE OVER THE

328
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
DEBT CEILING COMING IN THE EARLY

329
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
PART OF THE YEAR.
>> OKAY, JON KARL, THANKS VERY

330
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
MUCH.

331
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
>>> OF COURSE, WE'RE GOING TO

332
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
COVER ALL THESE WASHINGTON
STORIES, THE WHOLE WEEK IN

333
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
POLITICS, SUNDAY ON "THIS WEEK,"

334
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
WITH SENATOR JOHN McCAIN AND THE

335
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
ROUNDTABLES.

336
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
>>> AND GUESS WHAT, JUST TWO

337
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
WEEKENDS UNTIL CHRISTMAS.

338
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
SO MANY PEOPLE KOUMPBTING DOWN

339
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
TO THE HOLIDAYS.

340
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
AND IT COULD BE A RECORD-SETTING

341
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
HOLIDAY FOR BOTH RETAIL AND
TRAVEL.

342
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
ABC'S BIANNA GOLODRYGA IS

343
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
STANDING BY WITH THE EXTREMES

344

RETAILERS ARE GOING THROUGH TO

345
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
GET YOUR DOLLARS.

346
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
BUT LET'S FIRST GO TO LISA

347
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
STARK, WHO IS TRACKING THE

348
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
LATEST ON WHY THIS HOLIDAY COULD

349
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
BE VERY TRICKY FOR TRAVELING.

350
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
LISA, GOOD MORNING.

351
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
>> Reporter: AMY, TRAVELING OVER

352
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
THE HOLIDAYS IS BEST

353
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
CIRCUMSTANCES.

354
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
CAN BE TRICKY.

355
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
GET A LOAD OF THIS.

356
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
HUNDREDS OF WORKERS AT NEW YORK

357
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
CITY JFK AIRPORT THREATENING TO

358
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
GO ON STRIKE ON DECEMBER 20th.

359
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
THESE ARE THE SECURITY GUARDS.
NONE AT THE CHECKPOINT.

360
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
BUT THEY DIRECT TRAFFIC, MAKE

361
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
SURE THE GATES ARE SECURE.

362
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
IT COULD ADD TO THE CHAOS OF

363
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
TRAVELERS WILL FEEL OVER A BUSY

364
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
HOLIDAY.

365
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
PLANES WILL BE PACKED.

366
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
THE AIRLINE TRADE GROUP SAYS 85%

367
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
TO 90% OF THE SEATS WILL BE
FILLED.

368
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
AND THE HOLIDAY TRIP WILL COST

369
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
YOU MORE THAN LAST YEAR, 9%

370
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
MORE, ACCORDING TO

371
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
TRAVELOCITY.

372
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
NONSTOP PRICES ARE NEARLY DOUBLE

373
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
THAN WHAT THEY WERE AT THE
BEGINNING OF DECEMBER.

374
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
>> THE AVERAGE PRICE

375
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
IS OVER $400 ROUND-TRIP.

376
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
THAT'S A BIG BITE OUT OF

377
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
SOMEONE'S WALLET, ESPECIALLY IF

378
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
YOU MULTIPLY THAT ACROSS SEVERAL

379
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
FAMILY MEMBERS.

380
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
>> Reporter: IF YOU'RE STILL ON

381
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
THE FENCE ABOUT WHETHER TO TAKE

382
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
THAT CHRISTMAS FLIGHT, DECIDE

383
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
FAST.
>> THE TIME TO BOOK WAS WEEKS

384
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
AGO.

385
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T BOOKED YET,
YOU HAVE TO PULL THE TRIGGER

386
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
RIGHT NOW.

387
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
PRICES ARE GOING UP, NOT EVERY
DAY, BUT EVERY HOUR YOU WAIT.

388
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
>> Reporter: LOOKING FOR CHEAPER

389
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
FARES, TRAVELOCITY SAYS YOUR

390
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
BEST BET IS CHRISTMAS EVE AND
CHRISTMAS DAY.

391
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
THE MOST EXPENSIVE DAYS TO FLY

392
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
ARE DECEMBER 21st AND 22nd, AND

393
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
RETURNING ON DECEMBER 30th.

394
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
THAT COULD COST YOU AN EXTRA
$500 A TICKET.

395
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
AND IF YOU CAN BE FLEXIBLE,

396
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
THERE ARE LESS EXPENSIVE

397
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
DESTINATIONS, THINK FLORIDA,

398
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
DENVER AND LOS ANGELES.

399
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
ALL BECAUSE OF FIERCE AIRLINE

400
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
COMPETITION.

401
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
CONNECTING FLIGHTS ARE OFTEN

402
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
CHEAPER AS ARE THOSE SHORT HOPS

403
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
OF LESS THAN AN HOUR.

404
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
AND BE CAREFUL HOW YOU PACK YOUR

405
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
BAGS.
TOO MANY OF THEM OR TOO HEAVY,

406
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
AND THOSE BAG FEES CAN COST YOU
MORE THAN THE TICKET.

407
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
AND IF YOU'RE SKIPPING THE PLANE

408
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
AND TRAVELING BY CAR, THAT'S

409
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
THE ROADS MAY BE BUSIER THAN

410
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
THEY'VE BEEN IN SOME SIX YEARS.

411
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
ALL BECAUSE GASOLINE PRICES HAVE
PLUMMETED.

412
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
IT'S A DOLLAR LESS A GALLON THAN

413
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
IT WAS JUST A YEAR AGO.

414
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
AT LEAST, AMY, THAT IS A VERY

415
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
NICE CHRISTMAS PRESENT.

416
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
>> MORE MONEY FOR SHOPPING.

417
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
THANKS SO MUCH.
>>> SPEAKING OF SHOPPING, RETAIL

418
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
SALES ROSE IN NOVEMBER.

419
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
AND DECEMBER COULD BE AN EVEN

420
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
BIGGER MONTH FOR THE ECONOMY, AS

421
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
RETAILERS COMPETE FOR YOUR

422
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
MONEY.
ABC'S BIANNA GOLODRYGA IS

423
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
TRACKING THE LATEST.

424
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
THEY'RE PULLING OUT ALL THE

425
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
STOPS.

426
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
>> Reporter: THEY ARE, AMY.

427
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON

428
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
STARTED OFF WITH A BANG.

429
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
REMEMBER THIS --

430
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
THANKSGIVING WEEKEND, AMERICANS
SPENT SOME $59 BILLION.

431
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
THAT'S UP NEARLY 13% FROM LAST
YEAR.

432
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
NOW, THE CHALLENGE IS TO KEEP
THE MOMENTUM GOING.

433
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
KEEP SHOPPERS IN THE STORES.

434
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
HOW ARE STORES DOING THAT?

435
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
THEY'RE EXTENDING HOURS, MAKING
IT EASIER FOR SHOPPERS TO COME

436
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
OVER AND BUY MERCHANDISE.

437
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
MACY'S, FOR EXAMPLE, OPEN

438
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
48 HOURS THE WEEKEND BEFORE

439
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
CHRISTMAS.

440
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
TARGET, OPEN UNTIL 9:00 P.M. ON
CHRISTMAS EVE.

441
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
AND THEN, RIGHT ACROSS THE

442
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
STREET AT TOYS "R" US HERE, FOR
THREE WEEKS THEY'RE OPENED

443
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
24 HOURS AROUND THE CLOCK.

444
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
THIS IS GOOD FOR THE SHOPPERS

445
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
AND FOR THE ECONOMY THAT MORE

446
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
TEMPORARY JOBS WILL BE ADDED.

447
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
SOME 619,000 JOBS WERE CREATED
IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER ALONE.

448
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
THAT'S UP SINCE LAST YEAR.

449
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
AND UP 19% FROM LAST YEAR.

450
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
NEARLY TO A 2000 HIGH.

451
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
AMY.

452
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
>> GOOD NEWS.
THANKS FOR THAT.

453
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
>>> BACK TO BARBARA WALTERS FOR

454
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
MORE OF HER EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE

455
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
FIRST LADY.
IT'S BECOMING A HOLIDAY

456
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
TRADITION.
IT AIRS TONIGHT ON "20/20."

457
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
AND BARBARA IS HERE WITH SOME OF
THE HIGHLIGHTS RIGHT NOW.

458
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
YOU GOT THE FULL TOUR.

459
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
AS ALWAYS.

460
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
>> I GOT THE FULL TOUR OF THE

461
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
WHITE HOUSE, WITH THE STAR OF
THE WHITE HOUSE.

462
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
THAT'S NOT THE PRESIDENT OR THE

463
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
FIRST LADY.

464
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
YOU KNOW IT'S BO.

465
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
>> BUT YOU DID SIT DOWN WITH THE

466
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
PRESIDENT AND COVERED THE NEWS
OF THE DAY, AS WELL?

467
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
>> WE DID.

468
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
WE TALKED TO THE TWO OF THEM.

469
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT WHEN THEY
ARE TOGETHER.

470
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
THEY'RE FUNNY AND CUTE.

471
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
BUT WE ALSO ASKED THE PRESIDENT

472
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION

473
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
ABOUT THE LEGALIZATION OF

474
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
MARIJUANA.

475
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
THERE ARE TWO STATES IN WHICH IT

476
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
IS LEGAL.
>> WASHINGTON AND COLORADO.

477
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
WE'LL TAKE A LOOK.
>> DO YOU THINK THAT MARIJUANA

478
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
SHOULD BE LEGALIZED?

479
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
>> I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR.

480
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
BUT I WHAT THINK IS THAT, AT

481
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
THIS POINT, WASHINGTON AND

482
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
COLORADO, YOU'VE SEEN THE VOTERS

483
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE.

484
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
AND, AS IT IS, THE FEDERAL

485
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
GOVERNMENT HAS A LOT TO DO WHEN

486
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
IT COMES TO CRIMINAL

487
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
PROSECUTIONS.

488
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE FROM A

489
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
PRIORITIZATION POINT OF VIEW,

490
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
FOR US TO FOCUS ON RECREATIONAL

491
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
DRUG USERS IN A STATE THAT HAS

492
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
ALREADY SAID, UNDER STATE LAW,
THAT'S LEGAL.

493
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
>> THAT'S INTERESTING.
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T WANT TO

494
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
CONFLICT WITH THE STATES.

495
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
EVEN THOUGH IT'S THE ATTORNEY

496
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
GENERAL'S FINAL DECISION.

497
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
>> I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE FACT

498
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
THAT WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER, HE

499
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
SMOKES MARIJUANA.

500
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
AND WHAT DOES HE TELL HIS GIRLS?
HE SAYS, DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKES

501
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
THAT I MADE.

502
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
>> THE ONLY THING HE CAN SAY.

503
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
YOU ALSO TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT

504
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
ABOUT HOW HE'S SPENDING THAT

505
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
LITTLE BIT OF SPARE TIME HE HAS?

506
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
>> AND YOU SEE THE TWO OF THEM

507
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
TOGETHER, QUARRELLING ABOUT

508
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
SCRABBLE, NO LESS.
TAKE A LOOK.

509
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
YOU HAVE AN iPAD.

510
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
>> I DO.

511
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
>> WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE APP?

512
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
>> SCRABBLE.

513
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
>> OH, YEAH.

514
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
GOSH.

515
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
SOMETIMES I WANT TO YANK THAT

516
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
OUT OF YOUR HAND.

517
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
>> AND WHO WINS?

518
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
>> HE'S GOOD AT SCRABBLE.

519
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
HE'S VERY IRRITATING.

520
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
>> SHE DOESN'T LIKE LOSING.

521
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
SO, SHE STOPPED PLAYING.

522
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
>> I DON'T LIKE LOSING TO YOU

523
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
BECAUSE YOU'RE IRRITATING WHEN

524
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
YOU WIN.

525
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
>> THE THING THAT'S CHARMING

526
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW, WHICH
YOU'LL SEE TONIGHT, IS HOW

527
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
DIFFERENT THEY ARE -- YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU INTERVIEW THEM ALONE,

528
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
THEY'RE VERY SERIOUS.

529
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
TOGETHER, SHE TEASES HIM.

530
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
HE TEASES HER.

531
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
IT'S A WHOLE OTHER LOOK.

532
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
BUT THEN, WHAT I FOUND VERY

533
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
TOUCHING, I ASKED THE PRESIDENT

534
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
AND FIRST LADY IF THEY HAD A

535
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
MESSAGE FOR ROBIN.

536
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
AND, INDEED, THEY DID.

537
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
>> LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

538
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE TO SEND A

539
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
BIG CHRISTMAS GREETING TO ROBIN

540
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
ROBERTS, PART OF YOUR TEAM.

541
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

542
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
>> WHO IS JUST SUCH A WONDERFUL

543
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
PERSON.

544
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
SOMEBODY THAT WE'VE, YOU KNOW,

545
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
COME TO REALLY LOVE.

546
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
SO, WE'RE JUST ROOTING FOR HER.

547
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000

>> WE CAN TAKE YOU THROUGH A

1443
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
TIME LINE AS IT'S COME

1444
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
AVAILABLE.

1445
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
THIS ACCORDING TO THE

1446
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,000
CURRENT.COM.
WEBSITE OF THE HARTFORD COURANT.

1447
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
THE SHOOTER WAS IN FACT IN THE

1448
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
MAIN OFFICE OF THE SCHOOL,

1449
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
AGAIN, UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF

1450
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
TWO SHOOTERS, WE DO OF COURSE,

1451
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
WE CAN CONFIRM ONE SHOOTER HAS

1452
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
BEEN KILLED.

1453
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
ANOTHER PERHAPSES AT LARGE.

1454
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
WE DON'T HAVE THAT CONFIRMED.

1455
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
AND AGAIN, AS OF 10:30 EASTERN,

1456
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
STUDENTS WERE STILL BEING LED AS

1457
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
YOU SEE THE STUDENTS HERE, LED

1458
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
FROM THE SCHOOL, BY THEIR

1459
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
TEACHERS.

1460
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
AGAIN, WE CAN TELL YOU NOW, IT'S

1461
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SCENE, THOUGH

1462
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
THE SCHOOL ITSELF HAS BEEN

1463
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
CLEARED.

1464
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
WE DID RECEIVE REPORTS AS WELL

1465
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
THAT THE FBI, S.W.A.T. TEAM WAS

1466
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
ON SCENE.

1467
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
WE WANT TO BRING IN A FORMER IF

1468
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
FBI SPECIAL AGENT, BRAD GARRETT

1469
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
JOINING US BY PHONE.

1470
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
REPORTS OF S.W.A.T. AND FBI HAVE

1471
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
RESPONDED ALONG WITH STATE

1472
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
POLICE AS THEY LOCKED DOWN THAT

1473
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
SCHOOL, WHAT IS THE FIRST THING

1474
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
THEY'RE LOOKING TO DO.

1475
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
>> TO ENSURE THEY'VE GOT THE

1476
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
SITUATION CONTAINED, JOSH.

1477
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
THE PROBLEM IS, YOU STILL DON'T

1478
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
KNOW, THEY DON'T KNOW PERHAPS

1479
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
HOW MANY SHOOTERS THEY MIGHT

1480
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
HAVE, HAVE THEY DONE ANYTHING

1481
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
ELSE TO THE SCHOOL, THINK ABOUT

1482
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
HARRIS AND KLEBOLD AT COLUNBINE.

1483
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
THE SECOND IS, DO YOU HAVE ANY

1484
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
TEACHERS, CHILDREN INJURED TO

1485
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
GET OUT OF THE BUILDING TO SAVE

1486
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
THEIR LIVES.

1487
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
>> ONE SHOOTER IS CONFIRMED

1488
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
DEAD.
THEY DO BELIEVE THAT THERE MAY

1489
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
HAVE BEEN A SECOND SHOOTER.

1490
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
THEY HAVE CLEARED THE SCHOOL,

1491
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I'M IMAGINING THAT SEARCH MAY GO

1492
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
WELL BEYOND THE SCHOOL, LOOKING

1493
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
FOR A PERSON POTENTIALLY AT

1494
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
LARGE?
>> DEFINITELY.

1495
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
IF IN FACT THERE'S A SECOND

1496
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
SHOOTER THE PROBLEM IN THESE

1497
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
CASES IS THAT PEOPLE, SOMETIMES

1498
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
SEE THINGS THAT AREN'T EXACTLY

1499
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
ACCURATE.

1500
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,000
THERE MIGHT ONLY BE ONE SHOOTER,

1501
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
BECAUSE PEOPLE CAUGHT IT A

1502
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
CERTAIN WAY THINK THERE MAY BE

1503
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
TWO.

1504
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
>> THE DISTRICT HAS ASKED

1505
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
PARENTS NOT TO FLOOD DISTRICT

1506
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
PHONES WITH CALLS, EVERY PARENT

1507
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
WANT TO KNOW THAT THEIR CHILDREN

1508
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
ARE SAFE, I'M CERTAIN MANY

1509
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
PARENTS NOW MAKING THEIR WAY TO

1510
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
THE SCHOOL, WHAT WOULD TELL

1511
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
PARENTS RIGHT NOW AS THEY'RE

1512
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
MAKING THEIR WAY TO AN ACTIVE

1513
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
CRIME SCENE?

1514
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
>> TYPICALLY WHAT THE POLICE DO

1515
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
IS SET UP A CHECK POINT AT THE

1516
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
SCHOOL WHERE THEY CAN GO IN AND

1517
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
CHECK IN WITH AN OFFICER,

1518
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS, FIGURING

1519
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
OUT WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE, WHO

1520
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
HAS BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR AND WHO

1521
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
HAS NOT IS GOING TO TAKE A

1522
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
WHILE.

1523
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
THE REAL KEY IS, KEEPING PARENTS

1524
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
INFORMED.

1525
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
KEEPING THEM OFF THE PHONE AND

1526
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
KEEPING THEM AWAY FROM THE

1527
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
SCHOOL.

1528
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
>> WE HAVE A MOTHER WHO ATTEND

1529
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
THE SCHOOL.

1530
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
MYRA, YOU HAVE YOUR CHILDREN

1531
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000

SCHOOL.
THEY DON'T GO TO THESE SANDY

1539
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000

PARENTS RUNNING TO GET TO THE

01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
SCHOOL.
SOME PARENTS HAVE THEIR KIDS.

1551
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
SOME DON'T.
>> WE CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE CHAOS

1552
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
AND THE FEAR THERE WITH THOSE

1553
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
PARENTS DESPERATELY TRYING TO

1554
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
LOCATE THEIR CHILDREN.

1555
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000

WE'LL SEE THIS FALLING IN THE

FORM OF STORMS.

1582
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
STRONG STORMS ARE POSSIBLE ON

1583
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
THAT LINE.

1584
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
BUT NEXT WEEK, WE'LL START TO

1585
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000

01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
HE'S JUST BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN.

THERE YOU SEE HIM.

1800
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
THAT'S CAPTAIN GARCIA.

1801
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
HE THINKS HE'S JOINING "GMA" TO

1802
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
GIVE A HOLIDAY GREETING TO HIS

1803

FELLOW TROOPS STILL ON THE FRONT

1804
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
LINES.

1805
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
HE HAS NO IDEA HE'S ABOUT TO SEE
HIS WIFE AND KIDS, RIGHT THERE,

1806
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000

MATHISON FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

1808
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
ALMOST A YEAR.

1809
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
CAM, HOW IS EVERYBODY DOING?

1810
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
>> WE ARE BEYOND EXCITED HERE.

1811
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
COME ON, GUYS.

1812
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
WE'RE GOING THIS WAY.

1813
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
BUT WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO KEEP

1814
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
IT QUIET, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE

1815
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
CAPTAIN GARCIA IS LITERALLY,

1816
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
COME ON WITH ME, RIGHT ON THE

1817
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
OTHER SIDE OF THIS DOOR RIGHT

1818
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
HERE.

1819
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
SO, OBVIOUSLY, WE DON'T WANT TO

1820
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
GIVE IT AWAY.

1821
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
WE'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS FAR TOO

1822
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
LONG.

1823
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THE BIG

1824
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
MOMENT, THE BIG REVEAL, LET'S
TAKE A LOOK AT THE GARCIA FAMILY

1825
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
HISTORY.

1826
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
>> MY HUSBAND'S NAME IS GERARDO.

1827
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO HIM FOR TEN
YEARS.

1828
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
WE MET IN THE MILITARY.

1829
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I CAUGHT HIS EYE.

1830
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
AND HE CAUGHT MY EYE.
THE REST IS HISTORY.

1831
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
HE'S A FUNNY GUY.

1832
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
HE LIKES TO MAKE JOKES.

1833
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
WE ARE ALWAYS PLAYING JOKES ON

1834
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
EACH OTHER OR THE CHILDREN.

1835
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,000
>> HE CALLS ME THE FUZZY MAN.

1836
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
>> IS THAT SANTA?

1837
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I HAVE THREE KIDS.

1838
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
MARK IS OUR OLDEST.

1839
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
HE'S 10.

1840
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
ALESSANDRA, SHE'S 6.

1841
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,000
AND OUR BABY IS 3.

1842
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:05,000
>> HI.

1843
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
>> Reporter: BUT HER HUSBAND,

1844
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
CAPTAIN GERARDO GARCIA IS ON HIS

1845
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
FOURTH DEPLOYMENT IN
AFGHANISTAN, WHILE ANDREA HOLDS

1846
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
DOWN THE FORT IN CALIFORNIA.

1847
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
>> YOU LOVE WHAT YOU DO,

1848
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
YOU LOVE YOUR HUSBAND SO MUCH,

1849
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
YOU MAKE SACRIFICES.
>> Reporter: WHILE GERARDO

1850
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
SERVES HIS COUNTRY, ANDREA IS

1851
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
IN SCHOOL,

1852
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
GETTING HER NURSING DEGREE.

1853
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
>> I NEED TO BE A MODEL FOR

1854
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
THEM, TOO.
THAT'S WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR

1855
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
ME TO GO TO SCHOOL, TO BETTER

1856
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
MYSELF, SO THEY CAN SEE MOMMY

1857
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHILE

1858
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
THEIR DAD'S GONE.

1859
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
>> Reporter: BUT RAISING THREE

1860
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
KIDS, ESSENTIALLY AS A SINGLE

1861
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
PARENT, CAN TAKE A TREMENDOUS
EMOTIONAL TOLL.

1862
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
>> IT'S HARD.

1863
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
THEY DON'T GET TO SEE THEIR DAD

1864
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
IN THE MORNING.

1865
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
TO SAY, HI, HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

1866
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
OR GET THEIR DAD TO MAKE THEM

1867
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
PANCAKES THEY USED TO MAKE ON

1868
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
SUNDAYS.

1869
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
THINGS THAT NORMAL PARENTS DO

1870
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
FOR THEIR KIDS.

1871
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
>> Reporter: BUT NOW, CHRISTMAS

1872
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
IS COMING.

1873
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
AND THAT MEANS CAPTAIN GERARDO

1874
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
GARCIA IS COMING HOME FOR THE

1875
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
HOLIDAYS.

1876
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
BUT WITH A SPECIAL TWIST.

1877
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
HE HAS NO IDEA HIS FAMILY IS

1878
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
COMING TO THE BASE TODAY.

1879
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
AN INCREDIBLE EARLY CHRISTMAS

1880
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
SURPRISE.

1881
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
>> I'M SO READY TO BE ABLE TO

1882
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
HUG HIM AND KISS HIM AND LOVE ON

1883
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
HIM.
AND JUST BE TOGETHER.

1884
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
THE TOGETHERNESS IS WHAT I MISS

1885
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
IS MOST.

1886
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
>> HI, DADDY.

1887
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
>> HI, DAD.

1888
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
>> I MISS YOU, DADDY.

1889
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
>> WE ARE ALL READY FOR IT, TOO,

1890
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
RIGHT NOW.

1891
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS MOMENT.

1892
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
SO, YOU GUYS, CAN YOU OPEN MY

1893
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
MIC TO CAPTAIN GARCIA, PLEASE?

1894
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
HEY, CAPTAIN GARCIA.

1895
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS HERE.

1896
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

1897
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
>> YES, I CAN HEAR YOU.

1898
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
>> I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR
SERVICE TO THIS COUNTRY.

1899
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
FOUR TOURS IN AFGHANISTAN.

1900
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
THAT'S A TREMENDOUS SACRIFICE I

1901
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
KNOW YOU HAVE MADE.

1902
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
AND I KNOW YOU'RE THERE NOW TO

1903
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,000
SEND A HOLIDAY HOOHA TO ALL OF

1904
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
YOUR FELLOW TROOPS IN IRAQ AND

1905
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
AFGHANISTAN.

1906
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
WE'LL DO THAT IN A SECOND.

1907
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
BEFORE YOU DO THAT, CAN YOU JUST

1908
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
TURN AROUND FOR A SECOND?

1909
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
>> UM -- I'M SORRY --

1910
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
>> CAN YOU JUST TURN AROUND?

1911
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
>> TURN AROUND, YOU SAID?

1912
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
>> YEAH.

1913
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
CAN YOU TURN AROUND BEFORE WE DO

1914
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
THE GREETING?

1915
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
>> OH.

1916
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
HI.

1917
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,000
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING TO ME?

1918
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
WOW.

1919
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
LOVE YOU.

1920
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:34,000
>> SURPRISE.

1921
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,000
>> THERE IS REAL SURPRISE.

1922
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:48,000
OH, THAT IS SUCH A HAPPY MOMENT.

1923
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
>> I'M CAMERON MATHISON FOR

1924
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
"GOOD MORNING AMERICA."

1925
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
I'M THE EYES AND EARS BEHIND THE

1926
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
SCENES.

1927
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
WE WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU.

1928
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I HEAR THAT YOU ARE NORMALLY THE

1929
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
FAMILY'S PRACTICAL JOKER.

1930
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
HOW DO YOU THINK ANDREA DID?

1931
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
DID SHE SURPRISE YOU?

1932
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
>> YEAH.

1933
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I'M SPEECHLESS.

1934
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I DON'T EVEN HAVE ANYTHING TO

1935
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
SAY BECAUSE I'M TOTALLY CAUGHT

1936
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
OFF GUARD HERE.
>> YOU DIDN'T WANT TO TURN

1937
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
AROUND.

1938
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
>> YEAH.

1939
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
>> I KNOW GEORGE IN NEW YORK

1940
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
WANTS TO CHECK IN WITH YOU, AS

1941
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
WELL.

1942
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
>> OH, WE LOVED SEEING THAT

1943
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
MOMENT.

1944
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
YOU WERE SO INTENT ON FOLLOWING

1945
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
THE DIRECTIONS SO WELL.

1946
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
YOU ALMOST MISSED THE SURPRISE

1947
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
RIGHT THERE.

1948
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
ANDREA, I WANT TO ASK YOU.

1949
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
YOU HAD TO COOK UP SUCH AN

1950
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
ELABORATE PLAN TO PULL OFF THIS

1951
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
SURPRISE.

1952
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

1953
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
>> I HAD A LOT OF POSTING ON

1954
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
FACEBOOK, ELABORATE POSTS ON

1955
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:46,000
FACEBOOK.

1956
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID TO

1957
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
TAKE OFF THIS PLAN.
AND LUCKILY, YOU KNOW, HE TRUSTS

1958
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
ME SO MUCH, IT WAS VERY

1959
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
BELIEVABLE.

1960
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
>> NOT AFTER TODAY.

1961
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
>> AND I LOVE SEEING THE SMILE

1962
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
ON YOUR KIDS' FACES RIGHT NOW.

1963
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
THEY'RE GOING TO GET THEIR
PANCAKES THIS WEEKEND, CAPTAIN

1964
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
GARCIA?

1965
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
>> OH, YEAH.

1966
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
DEFINITELY.

1967
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
LIKE I SAID, I'M SPEECHLESS.

1968
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I'M KIND OF SHOCKED, BELIEVE IT

1969
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
OR NOT.

1970
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
AFTER ALL OF THE THINGS WE DID

1971
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
IN THE LAST YEAR, THIS IS

1972
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
PROBABLY THE MOST CHAOTIC ONE.

>> HOW LONG DO YOU LET THIS SIT?

2507
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
>> IF YOU HAVE AN HOUR, IT'S

2508
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
FINE.

2509
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,000
IF IT'S 30 MINUTES, THAT'S FINE.

2510
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
OVERNIGHT, THAT'S FINE, TOO.

2511
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
>> THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

2512
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,000
AFTER IT'S BEEN SITTING FOR A

2513
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
WHILE.

2514
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
>> HAS ALL THAT MARINADE IN IT.

2515
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:37,000
AND THEN A HOT GRILL.

2516
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
THIS IS GREAT THE CAST IRON

2517
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
GRILL.

2518
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
YOU CAN GET THE FLAVOR FROM THE

2519
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
CAST IRON.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

2520
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:46,000
YOU WANT THAT SOUND RIGHT THERE.
DOESN'T IT LOOK DELICIOUS?

2521
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
>> IT'S DELICIOUS AS WELL.

2522
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
YOU WANT TO HEAR THAT SIZZLE.

2523
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,000
THAT WAY YOU KNOW IT'S COOKING.

2524
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
>> HOW LONG WILL THEY TAKE ON

2525
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,000
THAT GRILL?

2526
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,000
>> THIS WILL PROBABLY TAKE
20 MINUTES OR SO.

2527
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
YOU CAN THROW THEM ON THE GRILL.
THEY'RE FINISHING UP.

2528
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
THROW THEM ON THE GRILL, POP

2529
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
THEM IN THE OVEN, FINISH THEM IN

2530
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:05,000
THE OVEN.

2531
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
THAT'S THE ROSEMARY.

2532
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:11,000
THAT'S COOKING WITH A WREATH OR
CHRISTMAS TREE.

2533
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
AND THEN, WE'RE MOVING OVER TO
SOME OF OUR MORE CREATIVE SIDES.

2534
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
POLENTA.
POLENTA'S GREAT.

2535
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,000
WE HAVE POLENTA.

2536
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS VERY
SIMPLY --

2537
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
WHERE IS IT AT?

2538
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,000
WE HAVE PULVERIZED THE

2539
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
GINGERBREAD MAN.
WE HAVE.

2540
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,000
>> THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

2541
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
>> GINGER, ALL OF THE FLAVORS,
AROMATIC.

2542
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
>> YOU JUST SPRINKLE IT ON TOP.

2543
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
>> THIS COULD BE --

2544
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:38,000
>> I WILL SAY, HE GAVE HIS LIFE

2545
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
SO THAT WE COULD ENJOY.

2546
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
WE THANK YOU FOR IT.

2547
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
THE SACRIFICE.

2548
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,000
>> AND THEN, OF COURSE, CREAMED
SPINACH.

2549
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
THIS IS MY FAVORITE RECIPE HERE.

2550
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,000
CREAMED SPINACH COOKED WITH

2551
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
EGGNOG.

2552
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:54,000
EGGNOG HAS NUTMEG IN IT.

2553
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,000
CREAMED SPINACH HAS NUTMEG IN

2554
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
IT.

2555
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
A NICE WAY TO REUTILIZE YOUR

2556
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
WREATH, YOUR CHRISTMAS TREE,

2557
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
YOUR GINGERBREAD MAN.

2558
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
AND THE CANDY CANE.
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT?

2559
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
HERE WE GO.

2560
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:10,000

RESTAURANT.

2564
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,000
LAMB AND MINT GOES TOGETHER

2565
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
REALLY WELL.

2566
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,000

>> SHAVED IT.

2568
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
