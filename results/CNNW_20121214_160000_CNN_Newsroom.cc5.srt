WHAT DO WE KNOW?

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
>> DISTURBING STORY.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000

DICKERSON DRIVE.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
THIS IS COMING TO US FROM ONE OF

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
OUR AFFILIATES.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
POLICE ARE REPORTING A NUMBER OF

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
INJURIES.
THE NATURE OF THE INJURIES AT

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
THIS POINT ARE UNCLEAR.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
WE'RE GOING TO BE CHECKING THAT

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
THROUGHOUT THE MORNING.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
STATE POLICE SOURCES SAY THAT

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
ONE PERSON IS DEAD.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
EARLIER REPORTS OF A SECOND
SHOOTER.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
THAT HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED AT
THIS POINT.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
A FEW MORE REPORTS, APPARENTLY

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
THE SHOOTING WAS REPORTED

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
SHORTLY AFTER 9:40 A.M. THIS

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
MORNING.
POLICE REPORTED THAT A SHOOTER

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
WAS IN THE -- APPARENTLY IN THE
MAIN OFFICE.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
>> WHICH IS HARD TO TELL WITH

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
THIS IMAGE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
BECAUSE THAT'S SORT OF

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF THE SCHOOL

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
LAYOUT DOESN'T SHOW WHERE THAT

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
IS.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
WE SHOULD MENTION THAT ONE OF

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
THE TV STATIONS THAT HAS BEEN

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
REPORTING ON THIS WAS TOLD BY A

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
WITNESS THAT SHE SAW TWO

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
CHILDREN, ONE WITH A BLOODY FACE

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
AND THE OTHER WITH WHAT APPEARED

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
TO BE A HAND INJURY.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
AGAIN, THAT COMING IN TO NEWS 8,

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
ONE OF THE LOCAL STATIONS IN THE

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
AREA.
>> THAT FALLS IN STEP WITH ONE

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
OF THE REPORTS THAT WE'RE

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
HEARING, THAT A PERSON IN ONE OF

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
THE ROOMS HAS, QUOTE, NUMEROUS

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL FROM SOME

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
OF THESE IMAGES THAT WE'RE

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
GETTING INTO OUR NEWSROOM WHERE

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING AT THE

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
SCHOOL.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
>> IS THERE ANY REPORTING AT

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
ALL, JASON?

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
THIS JUST BROKE WITHIN THE LAST

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
FEW MOMENTS BUT ANY REPORTS THAT

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
THE SHOOTER MAY HAVE BEEN A

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
STUDENT OR PERHAPS WAS THIS

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
STAFF-RELATED?

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
WHENEVER YOU HEAR ABOUT AN

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, THE LAST

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
THING THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE IS A

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
CHILD THAT MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT A

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
GUN TO SCHOOL AND I DO HAVE

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
SOMETHING FROM THE WEBSITE THAT

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
SAYS THIS IS A SCHOOL THAT

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
BEGINS IN KINDERGARTEN AND ONLY

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
GOES UP TO FOURTH GRADE.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
THESE ARE VERY YOUNG CHILDREN.
>> ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS IS

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
TELLING US THAT SHE SPOKE TO A

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
FATHER FROM THE DISTRICT WHO

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
REPORTED THAT ONE CHILD WAS IN

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
FACT TAKEN AWAY AND THAT CHILD

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED, QUOTE,

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
SERIOUSLY INJURED.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
THAT'S ONE CHILD TAKEN AWAY WITH

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
SERIOUS INJURIES.
>> BY AMBULANCE?

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
>> BY AMBULANCE.

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
AND THAT FALLS IN STEP WITH WHAT

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
WE HEARD ABOUT NUMEROUS GUNSHOT

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
WOUNDS.
ALSO, WE'RE BEING TOLD THAT

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
GROUPS OF STUDENTS, SOME OF THEM

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
CRYING, SOME OF THEM HOLDING

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
HANDS WERE ESCORTED AWAY FROM

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THE SCHOOL BY THEIR TEACHERS.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
SOME WERE IN SCHOOL STILL AS OF

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
10:30 A.M.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
>> THERE IS SOMETHING ON THE

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
WEBSITE AND IT'S UNKNOWN IF IT

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
WAS POSTED BEFORE OR AFTER THE

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
SHOOTING BUT IT DOES SAY THAT
AFTERNOON KINDERGARTEN IS

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
CANCELED AND THERE WILL BE NO

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
MIDDAY BUS RUNS.

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
AGAIN, NO OTHER INCLINATION.

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
POLICE WERE CALLED AND HAVE

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
RESPONDED BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY
WERE TOLD WAS A SHOOTING.

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
>> AND I'M SURE WE'LL BE GETTING
MORE DETAILS COMING IN.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
BECAUSE, AGAIN, DOZENS OF STATE

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
TROOPERS ARE ASSISTING LOCAL

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
POLICE.
HEAVILY ARMED POLICE ARE

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
GATHERED FROM THE SCHOOL AND A

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
NUMBER OF STRETCHERS HAVE BEEN

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
SET UP AS A PRECAUTION.
A STAGING AREA ALSO SET UP FOR

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
STUDENT AND THEIR PARENTS NEAR

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
THEIR SCHOOL, AS YOU CAN

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
IMAGINE.
A NUMBER OF PARENTS SITTING AT

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
HOME WATCHING THIS ARE GOING TO

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
BE WATCHING THIS WANTING TO --

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
ARE GOING TO BE WANTING TO KNOW
WHERE THEY SHOULD GO AND WHAT

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
THEY SHOULD DO TO MAKE SURE THAT

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THEIR KIDS ARE SAFE.
>> WHAT'S REMARKABLE ABOUT THIS

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
AS WELL IS THAT SANDY HOOK

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
ELEMENTARY IN NEWTOWN, KU

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
CONNECTICUT IS MIDWAY

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
NORTH-SOUTH BETWEEN STANFORD

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
WHICH WOULD BE IN THE BOTTOM

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
LEFT HAND CORNER.

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
>> VERY CLOSE TO DANBURY?

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
>> YES.

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
BUT A LONG WAY AWAY FROM THE

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
COAST WHICH IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
ARE FAMILIAR WITH AND THE METRO

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
TRAIN LINES, ET CETERA.

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
AND ALSO VERY DIFFICULT FOR

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
REPORTERS TO GET THERE AND

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
OTHERS AS WELL.

YOUR PAST.

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
WHAT IS THE PROTOCOL?

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
WHAT HAPPENS IMMEDIATELY WHEN A

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
CALL COMES IN TO AUTHORITIES

141
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
THAT IT IS AN ELEMENTARY SQUOCH

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
WHEN THEY ARE DEALING WITH A

143
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
POSSIBLE SHOOTER.

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000

THESE RESPONDING OFFICERS ARE

ESPECIALLY WITH INCIDENTS

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
INVOLVING CHILDREN, WHETHER THEY
ARE STRUCK BY AUTOS OR INCIDENTS

158
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
OF THE SCHOOLS, YOU JUST CAN'T

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
GET THERE FAST ENOUGH.

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
WE REALLY DON'T EXPECT TO HAVE

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
INCIDENTS OF THIS TYPE

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
HAPPENING.

I'M BEING TOLD THAT YOU HAVE

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
FOUR CHILDREN IN THIS SCHOOL?

166
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
MR. BRANCHWELL, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
WE'LL TRY TO RE-ESTABLISH OUR

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
CONNECTION WITH MIKE BRANCH
WELL.

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
IN THE MEANTIME, IF YOU'RE JUST

171
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
JOINING US, THERE IS SO LITTLE,

172
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
UNFORTUNATELY, TO REPORT ON THIS

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
WHICH IS WORRY SOME IN ITSELF

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THAT THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
SCHOOL IS ON LOCKDOWN.
I THINK WE HAVE MIKE BRANCHWELL

176

177
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000

>> I THINK YOU HAVE FOUR

180
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
CHILDREN.
ARE THEY ALL IN THIS SCHOOL?

181

>> WE HAVE TWO THAT HAVE

182
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
GRADUATED.

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
NO ONE HAS BEEN THROUGH THE
SANDY HOOK SCHOOL.

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
>> BUT IS THERE SOMETHING THAT
YOU CAN ADD TO THIS?

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
IS THIS YOUR COMMUNITY?

186
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
IS THIS YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD?
>> YES, IT'S OUR COMMUNITY AND

187
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
NEIGHBORHOOD AND OUR CHILDREN

188
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
HAVE FRIENDS THAT GO TO THAT

189
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
SCHOOL.
WE HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO IS IN AN

190
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT NOT THAT

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
ACTUAL SCHOOL.
>> SO WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT

192
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

193
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
THERE SEEMS TO BE A REAL VACUUM

194
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
OF INFORMATION.

195
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING?

196
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
HAVE YOU SEEN RESPONDERS GOING

197
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
BY IN WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

198
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
>> WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A

199
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
NUMBER OF RESPONDERS AT THE

200
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
SCHOOL.
THE SCHOOL HAS A VERY GOOD

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
SYSTEM OF COMMUNICATING TO

202
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
PARENT.
WE'VE GOT E-MAILS AND TEXTS AND

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
UPDATED INFORMATION.

204
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT.

205
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THE SCHOOL IS ON LOCKDOWN.

206
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
WE HAVE A FRESHMAN AT THE HIGH

207
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
SCHOOL WHO HAS BEEN TEXTING US.

208
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
HE'S IN LOCKDOWN IN THE SILENCE

209
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
LAB AT THE MOMENT.
BUT --

210
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
>> SO YOUR CHILD, THE FRESHMAN
IN HIGH SCHOOL, HAS BEEN ABLE TO

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
TEXT YOU THAT THERE IS A

212
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
LOCKDOWN AT THAT SCHOOL?

213
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
BECAUSE WE HAVE HEARD THAT THE

214
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
WHOLE DISTRICT IS IN LOCKDOWN.

215
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
THAT WOULD SQUARE WITH WHAT WE

216
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
ARE BEING TOLD.

217
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

218
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
THEY DO PRACTICE THIS.

219
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
WE HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE 2005 AND

220
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
THE SCHOOLS ARE VERY FORWARD

221
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
THINKING AND VERY PROACTIVE.

222
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
AND SADLY IN THIS TYPE OF

223
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
SITUATION.
SO THE KIDS KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT

224
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
AND WHAT TO DO.

225
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
WE DO CURRENTLY HAVE A FRESHMAN

226
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
IN LOCKDOWN.
>> AND THAT FRESHMAN, IS THAT A

227
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
SON OR DAUGHTER?

228
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
>> IT'S OUR SON.

229
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
>> AND HAS YOUR SON BEEN ABLE TO

230
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
TEXT YOU ANY OTHER KINDS OF

231
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
INFORMATION THAT HE MAY BE

232
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
HEARING WITHIN THE SCHOOL

233
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
ITSELF, NOT THE ELEMENTARY

234
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
SCHOOL BUT THE HIGH SCHOOL?

235
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
>> I THINK THAT THEY ARE ALL

236
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
USING PRECAUTIONS AND THE

237
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
TEACHERS HAVE GOT THE SITUATION

238
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
UNDER CONTROL.

239
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
HE KNOWS.

240
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
>> CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT

241
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
ABOUT NEWTOWN, THE SIZE AND

242
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
PROXIMITY TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE

243
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
IN THE UNITED STATES MIGHT GLEAM
FROM IT, IF YOU CAN GIVE US A

244
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
DESCRIPTION OF YOUR TOWN?

245
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
>> IT'S A SMALL TOWN, VERY LARGE
SQUARE MILES BUT LOW POPULATION.

246
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
IT'S A VERY QUIET TOWN.

247
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
GREAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND THE

248
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
SCHOOLS ARE VERY HIGHLY RATED.

249
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
>> ALL RIGHT.
I WANT TO JUST ASK YOU TO STAND

250
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
BY, IF YOU WILL.

251
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
MY COLLEAGUE, JASON CARROLL, HAS

252
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
BEEN COLLECTING MORE

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
INFORMATION.
>> I THINK WE HAVE MORE

254
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
INFORMATION THAT MAY BE

255
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
IMPORTANT FOR PARENT.

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
WE'RE TOLD THAT THERE IS A

257
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
STAGING AREA SORT OF I AM PROM

258
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
TEA BEING SET UP AT VILLAGE

259
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
RESTAURANT AND PIZZA.

260
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
APPARENTLY THE PARKING LOT

261
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THERE.
THE SCHOOL IS JUST OVER THE HILL

262
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
FROM THAT LOCATION, JUST ABOUT A

263
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
FIVE-MINUTE WALK AWAY FROM THERE
AND APPARENTLY A NUMBER OF

264
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
PARENTS ARE GATHERED THERE

265
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
TRYING TO GET INFORMATION.

266
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
THAT'S BEING SET UP AS SOME SORT

267
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
OF INFORMAL STAGING AREA FOR

268
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
PARENTS TRYING TO GET

269
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN

270
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
AND THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN

272
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
TO HELP THIS TSHOOTING.

273
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
>> ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, JUST TO

274
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
RECAP YOU, AN ELEMENT REE SCHOOL

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, IN THE

276
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
SOUTHWESTERN PART.

277
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
THIS IS THE AERIAL VIEW OF WHAT

278
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
THE SCHOOL LOOKS LIKE AND YOU
CAN TELL HOW BIG THE LAYOUT OF

279
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THIS SCHOOL IS.

280
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
BUT THE HARTFORD IS SAYING THAT

281
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
ONE PERSON HAD NUMEROUS WOUNDS.

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
WE'RE NOT BEING GIVEN ANY

283
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
INFORMATION AT THIS POINT.

284
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
IF THERE ARE OTHER INJURIES OR

285
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
WHERE THOSE CHILDREN ARE IN THAT

286
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
SCHOOL RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE GOING TO SQUEEZE IN A

287
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
QUICK BREAK, GATHER MORE
INFORMATION, AND BE RIGHT BACK

288
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
AFTER THIS.
[ sniffs ] I HAVE A COLD.

289
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
[ sniffs ] I TOOK DAYQUIL
BUT MY NOSE IS STILL RUNNY.

290
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
[ Male Announcer ] TRUTH IS,
DAYQUIL DOESN'T TREAT THAT.

291
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
REALLY?
[ Male Announcer ]
Alka-Seltzer Plus

292
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
FIGHTS YOUR WORST
COLD SYMPTOMS,

293
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
PLUS IT RELIEVES
YOUR RUNNY NOSE.

294
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
[ breathes deeply ]
AWESOME.

295
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
[ Male Announcer ]
YES, IT IS.

296
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
THAT'S THE COLD TRUTH!

297
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
[ Male Announcer ]
YES, IT IS.

298
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
...so as you can see, GEICO's
customer satisfaction is at 97%.

299
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Mmmm tasty.

300
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And cut! Very good.

301
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

302
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

303
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

304
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's not real.

305
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

306
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

307
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

308
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

309
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Bye!

310
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Bye!

311
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Bye!

312
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Santa, we made a video for
your trip!

313
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah, you can watch it on your
sleigh!

314
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
OK!

315
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Here you go.

316
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Aw, thanks elves.

317
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I also made you a video.

318
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You are so sweet.

319
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But you probably shouldn't watch
it on the sleigh.

320
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Say goodbye to Santa boys!

321
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Bye!

322

IT'S A TOWN MIDDAY BETWEEN

STANFORD AND HARTFORD IN

334
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
REPORTS CAME IN EARLY THIS
MORNING OF A SHOOTING AND THE

335
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
RESPONSE WAS QUICK AND FURIOUS.

336
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
YOU CAN SEE NOW FROM THE AERIAL

337
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
SHOTS SOME OF THE OFFICERS, ONE

338
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
OF THEM WITH A CANINE UNIT ON

PARENTS HAVE BEEN ADVISED TO

STAY AT HOME.

346
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
PARENTS HAVE BEEN TOLD TO STAY

347
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
AT HOME.

348
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
THESE PICTURES JUST SHOT MOMENTS
AGO IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE

349
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
PARKING LOT AT SANDY HOOK

350
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
ELEMENTARY.
YOU CAN SEE A NUMBER OF POLICE

351
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
AND A CHILD BEING TAKEN AWAY BY

352
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
AMBULANCE AND PARENTS YOU CAN

353
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
SEE IN THAT SHOT WALKING THROUGH

354
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
AND CARRYING THEIR CHILDREN,

355
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
ANOTHER ONE HOLDING ON TO KIDS,

TOO.

357
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
WE ALSO HEARD THAT SOME OF THE

359
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
HAVE BEEN EVACUATED TO A NEARBY

THE GROUND PICTURES SHOWING

THINGS FAIRLY CALM BUT CERTAINLY
A STRONG POLICE PRESENCE AND

363
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
WHAT THAT CANINE UNIT IS DOING.

364
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'M NOT CLEAR.

365
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
THEY SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN

366
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000

PARENTS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO STAY

407
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
HOME, ALTHOUGH YOU CAN IMAGINE

408
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF YOU HAD

409
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
CHILDREN IN THAT SCHOOL.

410
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
THE LAST THING YOU WOULD THINK

411
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
OF TO DO IS TO STAY HOME.

412
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
POLICE ARE BRANCHING OUT TO THE

413
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
SURROUNDING AREA.
THE SCHOOL IS SORT OF A SQUARE

414
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
FORMATION.
IT'S A LARGE CAMPUS FOR AN

415
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY ARE

416
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
HEADING OUT INTO THE BRUSH

417
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000

GOTTEN UNDER WAY, REPORTS OF A

427
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
SHOOTING IN WHICH OFFICERS

428
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000

429
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
VERY LITTLE INFORMATION RIGHT

430
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000

431
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
THE HARTFORD CURRENT, A NOTABLE

VERY TERRIBLE SHOOTING
SITUATION.

436
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
WE HAD HEARD REPORTS THAT THERE

437
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
COULD HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE

438
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
SHOOTERS.
THAT IS UNCONFIRMED AT THIS

439
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
POINT.
BUT PARENT OBVIOUSLY NERVOUS

440
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
ABOUT THESE REPORTS.

441
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000

445
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
THE ROADS, WE'RE ALSO TOLD, HAVE

446
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
BEEN SHUT DOWN AND TRAFFIC HAS

447
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
BEEN BOTTLENECKED IN THIS AREA.

448
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
THIS IS NOT FAR FROM DANBURY.

449
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
GEOGRAPHICALLY SPEAKING,

450
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
PROBABLY ABOUT AN HOUR, 40

451
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
MINUTE DRIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY

452
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
IF YOU'RE HEADING UP THE COAST

453
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
AND THEN INLAND SOMEWHAT,

454
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
BETWEEN STANFORD DOWN IN THE

455
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
SOUTHWEST CORNER AND HARTFORD AS

456
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
YOU CAN SEE IN THE CORNER, THE

457
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
CAPITAL OF THE STATE.

458
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
JASON?
>> AS WE SAW THE PICTURE OF THE

459
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
MAN WITH THE YOUNG BOY, YOU CAN

460
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
IMAGINE HOW TRAUMATIZING THIS

461
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
MUST BE FOR THE CHILDREN.

462
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
THIS IS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

463
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
THEY WERE CRYING AND HOLDING

464
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
HANDS.
>> THEY HAVE THESE PROTOCOLS

465
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
WHEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS -- OF

466
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
THIS MAGNITUDE, THERE ARE

467
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
PROTOCOLS TO LOCK DOWN AND

468
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
BARRICADE YOURSELF, FIND SAFE

469
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
POSITIONS UNTIL AN ALL CLEAR IS

470
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
INDICATED TO GET THE KIDS OUT OF

471
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
SCHOOL.
>> OBVIOUSLY AS THE HOURS MOVE

472
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
ON, WE'RE GOING TO BE TRYING TO

473
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE MOTIVE

474
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
OF THE SITUATION.

475
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
>> OR WHO?

476
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
IS IT ANNED A DULT.
>> IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO

477
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
FIGURE OUT WHY THESE KINDS OF

478
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
THINGS HAPPEN.

479
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE

480
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000

THE MOTIVE BEHIND THE SHOOTING.

485
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
IT'S ALL DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND

486
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
WHY THESE THING HAPPEN.

487
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000

MANY SCHOOLS IN CONNECTICUT,

517
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, ANYWAY.

518
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
IT'S OFTEN AN 8:00 A.M. START.

519
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000

523
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000

AS A RESULT OF THIS SHOOTING.

527
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE EXTENT

528
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
OF THE INJURIES MAY BE.

529
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000

533
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
NOT SURE IF BRIDGEPORT HAS
RECEIVED ANY INJURED BUT THEY

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000

535
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000

THAT SCHOOL.

540
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
SO MANY SCHOOLS HAVE A VERY

541
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
STRICT PROTOCOL FOR AN EMERGENCY

542
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
SITUATION IN WHICH THEY

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
STAYING LOW UNTIL THEY GET SOME

546
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
KIND OF INDICATION THAT IT'S
SAFE TO EVACUATE THE SCHOOL.

547
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000

>> AND WHAT ABOUT THE CAR THAT

730
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
SEEMED TO BE THE FOCUS OF THE

731
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
INVESTIGATORS ON THE SCENE?

732
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
THERE'S A CAR THAT IS

733
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
ERRATICALLY PARKED AND MARKED

734
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
OFF WITH CRIME TAPE.

735
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
ANY INFORMATION THAT THAT IS

736
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
CONNECTED TO THIS?
>> Reporter: NO DETAILS ON THAT

737
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
AS OF YET.

738
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE FOR

739
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
MYSELF.

740
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
SO WE ARE -- WE'LL GET THERE AS

741
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
SOON AS WE CAN.

742
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LARGE POLICE

743
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
PRESENCE ON THE SCENE.

744
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
AGAIN, REPEATING HERE THAT THE

745
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
SHOOTER, SUSPECTED SHOOTER IN

746
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
THIS CASE IS DEAD.

747
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
EITHER TAKEN DOWN BY POLICE OR

748
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
HE MAY HAVE TAKEN HIS OWN LIFE.

749
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
THAT REMAINS UNCLEAR AT THIS

750
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
POINT.
>> I JUST WANT TO BRING IN AS

751
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
WELL, SOME OF THE REPORTS HAVE

752
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
BEEN COMING IN FROM LOCAL

753
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
NEWSPAPERS, SOME OF THE LOCAL

754
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
AFFILIATES.

755
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
THE NEWTOWN B AND MULTIPLE

756
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
REPORTS OF INJURIES AFTER THIS

757
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
SHOOTING AT THE SANDY HOOK

758
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
I WANT TO JUST DIP IN OUR

759
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
AFFILIATE COVERAGE.
>> WE DO NOT HAVE THAT CONFIRMED

760
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
YET BUT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO

761
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
DETERMINE THAT.

762
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
THE INFORMATION IS JUST GOING

763
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
OUT TO THE PARENTS.
A LOT OF THEM ARE UPSET AS THEY

764
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
ARE TRYING TO PICK UP THEIR

765
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
CHILDREN.

766
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
THERE IS A LOT OF CONFUSION AND

767
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
CARS JAMMED IN HERE AND PEOPLE

768
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
JUST CAN'T GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO

769
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
GET SOME SOLID INFORMATION BUT
THAT IS GOING TO BE COMING AS

770
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
THEY SECURE THE SCENE.

771
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
>> ROBERT, THEY ARE REPORTING OR

772
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
CONFIRMING THAT ONE GUNMAN IS

773
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
DEAD.

774
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
IS THERE ANY INDICATION AS

775
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
YOU'RE OUT THERE AND HEARING

776
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
PEOPLE AROUND YOU THAT THERE
COULD BE ANOTHER SHOOTER?

777
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
>> WELL, THERE WAS SOME

778
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
INFORMATION THAT SOMEBODY -- AT

779
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
LEAST ONE PARENT SAW SOMEBODY

780
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
BEING ESCORTED OUT OF THIS

781
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
WOODED AREA RIGHT OVER HERE WITH

782
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
POLICE AND THAT THAT PERSON

783
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
TURNED TO A PARENT AND SAID, IT

784
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
WASN'T ME.

785
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
THE PERSON WAS JIBED DESCRIBED

786
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
WEARING A CAMMO TYPE SHIRT.

787
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
THE PERSON IS BEING HELD IN ONE

788
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
OF THE POLICE CARS OVER HERE TO

789
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
THE LEFT.
AT THIS POINT WE DON'T KNOW IF

790
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
THAT PERSON IS CONNECTED AND WE

791
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
ARE STILL TRYING TO DETERMINE

792
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
SOME EXACT INFORMATION ABOUT

793
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
WHETHER THERE IS ONE GUNMAN, TWO

794
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
GUNMAN, OR MORE AND IF SOMEBODY

795
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
IS DEAD WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

796
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
THESE SHOOTINGS INSIDE THE

797
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
SCHOOL HERE.

798
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
BUT, AGAIN, WE ARE JUST TRYING

799
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT EXACTLY

800
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
HAPPENED INSIDE AND I THINK THAT

801
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
POLICE ARE OF COURSE SWARMING

802
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
THE AREA MAKING SURE THAT WE

803
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
ALSO SAW SOME FEDERAL AGENTS

804
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
FROM THE ATF ARMED WITH HEAVY

805
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
GUNS TRYING TO ASSIST THE

806
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
NEWTOWN POLICE AND, OF COURSE,

807
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
THE STATE POLICE.
>> ALL RIGHT, ROBERT, WE'LL

808
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
CHECK IN WITH YOU IN A MOMENT.

809
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
LET'S RECAP WHAT WE KNOW.

810
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY, 600 OR SO

811
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
STUDENTS.
THERE WAS A SHOOTING REPORTED AT

812
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
9:41 A.M.

813
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
THAT'S WHEN A CALL CAME IN TO

814
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
911.
WE CAN CONFIRM AT LEAST ONE

815
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
PERSON HAS BEEN SHOT AT THAT

816
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
SCHOOL.
WE ALSO HAVE BOB ORR FROM CBS

817
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
NEWS, JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT FROM

818
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
CBS NEWS, HE HAS BEEN REPORTING

819
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
THAT THE GUNMAN IS DEAD.

820
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
>> THE PICTURE THAT IS MAKING

821
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
ITS WAY ON OUR AIR, THE SYMBOL

822
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
OF WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING,

823
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
WE'VE BEEN SEEING THE CHILDREN

824
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
LED AWAY CRYING, LED AWAY FROM

825
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
THEIR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CRYING

826
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
AS THEY ARE WALKING OUT AND

827
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
ADULTS TRYING TO KEEP THEM SAFE.

828
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
NOW THE SCHOOL IS GOING THROUGH

829
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
THE EFFORT OF TRYING TO REUNITE

830
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN TAKEN

831
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
TO THE NEARBY FIREHOUSE WITH THE

832
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
PARENTS WHO HAVE BEEN LINING UP

833
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
THERE.
THE SCHOOL IS TRYING TO KEEP

834
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
PARENTS INFORMED THERE AND AT

835
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
THE SAME TIME THEY ARE ASKING

836
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
PARENTS NOT TO GO TO THE SCHOOL.

837
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
>> YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT KIND OF

838
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
EX CRUCIAL ATING REQUEST THAT IS

839
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
THAT THEY ARE ASKING THAT YOU

840
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
WAIT FOR THEM.

841
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
BUSES HAVE BEEN CANCEL LTD.
NO BUSES ARE RUNNING AT THIS

842
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
POINT.

843
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
THOSE ARE S.W.A.T. OFFICERS.

844
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
THEY HAVE THEIR HELMET AND

845
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
CAMOUFLAGE ON.

846
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
THEY ARE GATHERING OUTSIDE OF

847
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
THE FRONT DOOR.

848
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
WHAT WE DO KNOW AT THIS POINT IS
THAT THE ENTIRE AREA IS IN

849
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
LOCKDOWN.

850
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
ONE GENTLEMAN HAS BEEN TAKEN

851
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
INTO CUSTODY AT LEAST THEY WANT

852
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
TO TALK TO HIM.

853
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
HE WAS TELLING A PARENT THAT HE

854
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
WAS NOT INVOLVED.
THAT'S WHAT POLICE DO, THEY LOCK

855
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
THE ENTIRE DOWN AND GET ANYONE

856
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
THEY WANT TO TALK TO AND TRY TO

857
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON.

858
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
>> ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMEONE IS ON

859
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
THE SCENE LIKE THIS WEARING

860
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
CAMOUFLAGE.

861
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
GUNS WERE STILL DRAWN AND THE

862
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
LAST REPORT WE HAD FROM HIM JUST

863
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
A FEW MOMENTS AGO WAS SAYING

864
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
THAT THINGS WERE NOT GETTING

865
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
BETTER.

866
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
THAT THIS IS A BAD SCENE.

867
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
THE HOSPITALS, WE KNOW, HAVE

868
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
BEEN PREPARED ALTHOUGH WE'RE

869
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
HEARING THAT THE HOSPITAL IN

870
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
BRIDGEPORT HAS NOW SAID THAT

871
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
IT'S NOT EXPECTING ANYONE COMING

872
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
TO THE BRIDGEPORT HOSPITAL.

873
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
AS FAR AS WHO EXACTLY HAS BEEN

874
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
SHOT, THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

875
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
INJURED, WE DO NOT KNOW.

876
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
WE'RE HANGING ON TO THE VERY

877
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
OMINOUS WORDS OF LIEUTENANT PAUL

878
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
VANCE FROM THE STATE POLICE.

879
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
>> AS WE CONTINUE TO LISTEN IN

880
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
TO SOME OF THE LOCAL COVERAGE

881
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
AND WATCHING FROM THESE

882
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
HELICOPTER SHOTS AS THE NUMEROUS
POLICE RESPONSE BEGINS TO WHAT

883
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
LOOKS LIKE HEAD TOWARDS ONE

884
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
LOCATION OF THE SCHOOL.
I CAN TELL YOU THE HEADLINE, A

885
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
SOURCE TELLS OUR SUSAN CANDIOTTI

886
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
THAT THE GUNMAN, THE SHOOTER IS

887
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
DEAD ON THE SCENE AND APPARENTLY

888
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
TWO WEAPONS HAVE ARE BEEN
RECOVERED.

889
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
WE ARE NOT CLEAR AS TO WHETHER
THE SHOOTER IS A CHILD OR AN

890
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
ADULT.
WE HAVE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS THAT

891
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
THERE IS A SECOND SHOOTER.

892
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
POLICE WERE SEARCHING IN THE

893
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
HILLSIDE BEHIND THE SCHOOL IN

894
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
THE WOODED AREA WITH THE CANINE

895
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
UNIT AS WELL AS PARENTS FLOODED

896
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
INTO THE PARKING LOT BEFORE THE

897
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
WORD CAME OUT THAT THEY WERE TO

898
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
STAY HOME, STAY BY THE PHONE,

899
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
THAT IT PERHAPS WASN'T SAFE TO

900
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
BE THERE.

901
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
POLICE TELLING NEWS 8 THAT THEY

902
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
SAW A CHILD WITH A BLOODY FACE

903
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
AND ANOTHER CHILD WITH A HAND

904
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
INJURY.

905
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
AND ONE OTHER PIECE OF

906
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
INFORMATION I WANT TO PASS YOUR

907
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
WAY BEFORE WE HEAD TO A QUICK

908
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
BREAK AND THAT IS THE HOSPITAL

909
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
AT YALE, YALE IS IN NEW HAVEN

910
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
WHICH IS ABOUT A 40-MINUTE DRIVE

911

00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIND OUT

1089
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
WHAT IS GOING ON.

1090
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
IT'S A LITTLE NERVE RACKING.

1091
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
AS YOU CAN TELL BEHIND US, WE DO

1092
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
HAVE A FEW MORE CARS PULLING IN

1093
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
AT THIS TIME.
HOW MANY SHOOTERS, HOW MANY

1094
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
PEOPLE ARE INJURED.

1095
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
>>.
>> Reporter: I SAW A PARENT

1096
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
RUNNING AND CRYING AT THE BOTTOM

1097
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
OF THE HILL WANTING TO FIND HIS

1098
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
CHILD.

1099
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
DID YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM FINDING

1100
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
ALEXIS?

1101
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
>> I DIDN'T HAVE TOO MUCH

1102
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
TROUBLE.

1103
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
OBVIOUSLY I WAS RUNNING TO THE

1104
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
SCHOOL.
SOMEBODY TOLD ME THAT THE KIDS

1105
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
WERE EVACUATED -- MOST OF THE

1106
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
KIDS WERE EVACUATED TO THE LOCAL
FIREHOUSE HERE.

1107
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
INSIDE THE FIREHOUSE IT WAS

1108
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
OBVIOUSLY TOUGH TO FIND BECAUSE

1109
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
IT WAS PACKED.

1110
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
BUT SHE WAS THERE AND WE'RE

1111
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
GRATEFUL.
>> Reporter: YEAH.

1112
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
AGAIN, IT'S PROBABLY A MORE
NERVE-RACKING SCENE FOR A

1113
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
PARENT, KEITH, THAN THE KIDS AT

1114
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
THIS POINT.

1115
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
THEY WERE THERE.
THEY ARE SAFE NOW.

1116
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
BUT EVERY SINGLE PARENT THAT

1117
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I'VE SPOKEN TO -- AND THERE'S A
MILLION OF THEM, ARE JUST SHAKEN

1118
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
UP AND WANT ANSWERS IMMEDIATELY.

1119
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
OF COURSE, NEWS 8 WILL BE HERE
LIVE FOR ALL OF THE DAY UNTIL WE

1120
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
HAVE SOME ANSWERS FOR YOU.

1121
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I'LL SEND IT BACK OVER TO YOU.

1122
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
>> AS THEY WRAP UP THAT LOCATION

1123
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
ON LOCATION, OUR LOCAL AFFILIATE

1124
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
WRAPPING UP THEIR INTERVIEW WITH

1125
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
AELECTS IS S

1126
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
AELECTS ALEXIS.

1127
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF THEM ON

1128
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
THE ROOF AND WHAT SHE SAW, IT

1129
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
CONFERS WITH WHAT WE'RE

1130
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
REPORTING, THAT S.W.A.T. TEAM

1131
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
WAS ON THE ROOF AS WELL AND

1132
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
CANINE UNITS AROUND THE SCHOOL

1133
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
AS WELL.

1134
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

1135
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
HAVEN'T SEEN YET IT A REPORTED

1136
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
VIDEO OF SOMEONE BEING TAKEN

1137
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
AWAY IN HANDCUFFS.
I CAN TELL THAT YOU SUSAN

1138
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
CANDIOTTI HAS CONFIRMED THAT THE

1139
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
SHOOTER IS DEAD ON THE SCENE.

1140
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
WHETHER IN FACT THERE WAS A

1141
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
SECOND PERSON WHO WAS ARRESTED

1142
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
HAS NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED.

1143
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
THE MAYOR OF DANBURY, MARK

1144
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
BOUGHTON IS ON THE PHONE WITH

1145
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
US.
>> A TEACHER WAS SHOT IN THE

1146
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
FOOT AND THAT TEACHER WAS TAKEN

1147
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
TO DANBURY HOSPITAL.

1148
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
THAT IS ONE INJURY THAT WE'RE

1149
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
HEARING FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES
AND NOW THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

1150
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
CONFIRMING THAT.

1151
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
>> WE HEARD THAT DANBURY

1152
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
HOSPITAL AS WELL AS BRIDGEPORT

1153
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
HOSPITAL HAVE BEEN ON STAND BY

1154
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF MULTIPLE

1155
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
VICTIMS BEING HOSPITALIZED.

1156
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
WE HAVE CONFIRMED AND IT'S

1157
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
LIKELY THE SAME PERSON HEADED TO

1158
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
BRIDGEPORT HOSPITAL, WE HAVE

1159
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
CONFIRMED THAT THE NEWTOWN

1160
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
AMBULANCE TRANSPORTED ONE PERSON

1161
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
THAT WAS SHOT IN THE FOOT TO

1162
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
THAT HOSPITAL.

1163
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
THEY ARE ON THE WAY TO

1164
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
BRIDGEPORT HOSPITAL WHERE THEY

1165
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
WILL BE TREATED.

1166
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
THAT PERSON IS IN STABLE

1167
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
CONDITION.
>> AND WE DO SEE -- I SAW A

1168
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
STRETCHER THERE.
IT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT WAS ON TOP

1169
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
OF THAT.
BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT LIVE

1170
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
AERIAL PICTURES FROM OUR WCBS

1171
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
HELICOPTER, OUR SISTER STATION

1172
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
IN NEW YORK THAT IS FLYING OVER

1173
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1174
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
AGAIN, THE NIGHTMARE BEGAN AT 20

1175
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
MINUTES BEFORE 10:00 ON THIS

1176
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
FRIDAY MORNING WHEN THEY GOT
REPORTS OF A SCHOOL SHOOTING AT

1177
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THAT GOES

1178
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
KINDERGARTEN THROUGH THE FOURTH

1179
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
GRADE.

1180
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
THE NEARBY FIREHOUSE, AS THE

1181
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
CROWS FLY, IT'S AERIAL SHOTS.

1182
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
IT'S NOT FAR AWAY.

1183
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
THAT'S BECOME THE STAGING

1184
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
SITUATION WHERE PARENTS HAVE

1185
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
BEEN SHOWING UP.

1186
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

1187
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
LOOKING AT NOW.

1188
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
PARENTS HAVE BEEN SHOWING UP

1189
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
THERE AND REUNITING WITH THEIR

1190
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
CHILDREN, TAKING THEM HOME.

1191
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
AND AS ROBERT SAID, WHEN HE WAS

1192
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
WATCHING THEM REUNITE, THE

1193
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
CHILDREN WERE QUITE SHAKEN.

1194
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
THEY WERE LED AWAY CRYING AND

1195
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY, VERY

1196
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
DIFFICULT THING TO EXPLAIN TO

1197
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
THESE YOUNG CHILDREN.

1198
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
>> AND WE DID SEE OBVIOUSLY A
LOT OF THAT EMOTION AND WE SAW

1199
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
FROM THE PARENTS AS THEY ARRIVED

1200
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
HERE JUST IN THIS SHOT THAT WE

1201
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
HAVE HAD UP FOR THE LAST SEVERA

1202
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
EMBRACING AS THEY WERE ARRIVING

1203
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
THERE AT THE SCENE.

1204
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
ROBERT IS THERE ON THE SCENE AS

1205
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
IS LYNN BESTOFF.

1206
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
THEY'RE THERE RIGHT NOW.

1207
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
>> THEY'RE INTERVIEWING SOME OF

1208
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
THE PARENT WHO IS CAN HAVE COME

1209
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
TO

1210
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
TO THE SCENE.
LET'S LISTEN.

1211
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
>> THERE'S SIGNING PROCEDURES.

1212
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I BELIEVE THE FRONT DOOR IS

1213
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
LOCKED DURING THE DAY, TOO.

1214
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I'M CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THESE

1215
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
PEOPLE DID GET INTO THE

1216
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
BUILDING.

1217
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
>> ANY IDEA AT ALL AND ANYTHING

1218
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
THAT PEOPLE ARE HEARING?

1219
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
>> FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN IT'S

1220
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
IMPOSSIBLE TO GET INTO A SCHOOL,

1221
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
ESPECIALLY AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

1222
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
TODAY WITHOUT PEOPLE CHECKING,

1223
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
CHECKING AND RECHECKING WHO YOU

1224
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
ARE AND IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

1225
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
THERE.
>> CORRECT.

1226
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I WOULD GUESS THEY WOULD HAVE

1227
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
PICKED UP ON -- UNLESS IT'S

1228
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
SOMEBODY THEY KNEW THEY LET INTO

1229
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
THE BUILDING.

1230
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
>> RIGHT.

1231
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
YOUR DAUGHTER FOR A THIRD GRADER

1232
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
SEEMS VERY CALM RIGHT NOW.

1233
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS HASN'T

1234
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
HIT HER YET?

1235
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

1236
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
WHEN I P PICKED HER UP, THOUGH,

1237
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
SHE WAS REALLY, REALLY UPSET AND

1238
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT.

1239
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
WE'RE JUST FORTUNATE ENOUGH THAT

1240
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
SHE'S HERE WITH US.

1241
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

1242
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
US.
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING YOUR

1243
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
DAUGHTER TO SPEAK TO US, AND WE,

1244
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
OF COURSE, KEITH, WILL LET THESE

1245
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
PEOPLE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING

1246
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
ON AS SOON AS WE GET WORD.

1247
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
>> OKAY.

1248
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
A COUPLE OF THINGS TO GET YOU UP

1249
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
TO SPEED ON.
ONE OF THE AFFILIATES, WFSB IS

1250
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
REPORTING THAT A TEACHER

1251
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
APPARENTLY HAS BEEN SHOT IN THE

1252
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
FOOT AND WAS TAKEN TO DANBURY

1253
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
HOSPITAL ABOUT 10, 15 MINUTES

1254
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
AWAY.

1255
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
THE MAYOR OF DANBURY HAS BEEN ON

1256
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
THE PHONE WITH US, MARK, AND I

1257
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
THINK WE MIGHT HAVE LOST HIM.

1258
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN'T GET

1259
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
RECONNECTED WITH HIM AT ONE

1260
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
POINT.

1261
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
ALSO, VERY, VERY IMPORTANT

1262
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
INFORMATION, AND THAT IS THAT

1263
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
ANY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IS LOCKED

1264
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
FOR THE MOST PART ACROSS THIS

1265
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
COUNTRY, AND IT IS NEXT TO

1266
