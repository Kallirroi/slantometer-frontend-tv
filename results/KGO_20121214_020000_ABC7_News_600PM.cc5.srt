00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
WEEKLY, HE SAID IT WAS MEANT TO

188
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
BE TONGUE IN CHEEK.

189
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
HE NOW FACES SUSPENSION.

190
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
>>> ONE OF THE BAY AREA'S

191
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDALS OF

192
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
THE YEAR TOOK A MAJOR TURN

193
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
TODAY.

194
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
NADIA LOCKIER, WIFE OF STATE

195
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
TREASURER BILL LOCKIER, DROPPED

196
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
HER REQUEST FOR A RESTRAINING

197
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
ORDER AGAINST HER FORMER

198
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
BOYFRIEND.
DAN WAS THE ONLY REPORTER AT THE

199
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
HEARING AND HERE WITH MORE ON

200
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THIS FOR US.

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
>> Reporter: I'VE BEEN TEXT WITH

202
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
THE FORMER BOYFRIEND.

203
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
THE STORY IS A METH USE WITH

204
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
NADIA AND OF A SEX TAPE FACTORED

205
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
INTO HER RESIGNING AS COUNTY

206
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
SUPERVISOR AND NOW SHE APPEARS

207
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
TO BE DOING WELL IN REHAB, BUT

208
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
HE IS IN A VERY DARK PLACE.

209
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
NADIA DID NOT COME TO COURT THIS

210
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
MORNING.
SHE REMAINS IN A SOUTHERN

211
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
CALIFORNIA REHAB CENTER NOW 107

212
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
DAYS SOBER.

213
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
NADIA TEXTED THE I TEAM LAST

214
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
MONTH.

215
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS

216
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
ROAD ON RECOVERY AND A NEW WAY

217
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
OF LIFE.

218
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
>> HER COUNSELORS HAVE HOPE FOR

219
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
HER TO COME OUT OF THIS PROCESS

220
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
AND MOVE ON WITH HER LIFE.

221
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
SO FROM ALL INDICATIONS, THINGS

222
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
ARE GOING WELL.

223
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
>> Reporter: HER ATTORNEY ASKED

224
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
THE JUDGE TO DELAY HEARING HER

225
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
REQUEST FOR A RESTRAINING ORDER

226
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
AGAINST FORMER BOYFRIEND STEVE

227
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
UNTIL SHE GETS OUT OF REHAB IN

228
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
FEBRUARY.
THE SCANDAL BLEW UP TEN MONTHS

229
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
AGO AFTER A VIOLENT

230
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE TWO AT

231
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
THIS NEWARK MOTEL.

232
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
IT LEFT HER WITH SCRAPES AND

233
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
DEEP BRUISES.

234
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
BUT AUTHORITIES DECLINED TO

235
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
PRESS CHARGES.

236
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
AFTER SHE PUBLICLY DISCUSSED

237
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
THEIR METH USE.
SHE RESIGNED FROM THE BOARD OF

238
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
SUPERVISORS AND ENTERED REHAB.

239
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
TODAY THE JUDGE SUGGESTED

240
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
DROPPING THE ISSUE OF A

241
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
RESTRAINING ORDER FOR NOW AND

242
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
RESCHEDULING IF NECESSARY WHEN

243
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
NADIA RETURNS TO THE BAY AREA.

244
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
>> SO THE COURT WOULD TAKE THE

245
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
MATTER OFF THE CALENDAR AND IF

246
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
WE WANT TO DO REISSUE, WE'LL DO

247
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
THAT.
OKAY.

248
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
GOOD ENOUGH.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ODDS

249
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
ARE OF YOU COMING BACK?

250
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
YOU THINK IT COULD DIE RIGHT

251
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
HERE?
>> I THINK IS A GOOD CHANCE THIS

252
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
COULD DIE HERE.

253
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
NADIA WILL GO THROUGH TREATMENT
AND RECONSIDER HER OPTIONS AND

254
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
ONE OF THE OPTIONS WILL BE, OF

255
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
COURSE, TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE

256
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
THIS.
ANOTHER OPTION MAY BE TO LET

257
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
MATTERS LIE THE WAY THEY ARE AND

258
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
MOVE ON.

259
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
>> Reporter: NADIA'S HUSBAND,

260
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
BILL, FILED FOR DIVORCE IN JULY.

261
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
BUT IT'S NOW ON HOLD, THAT BILL

262
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
AND NADIA ARE WORKING WELL

263
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
TOGETHER.
BILL'S PAYING FOR REHAB AND

264
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
BRINGING THEIR SON TO SOUTHERN

265
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
CALIFORNIA REGULARLY TO VISIT

266
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
NADIA.
IT'S A MUCH DIFFERENT STORY FOR

267
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
STEVE.

268
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
THERE IS A WARRANT FOR HIS

269
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
ARREST AFTER HE MISSED A COURT

270
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
APPEARANCE.

271
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
POLICE SAY HE TRIED OSTEAL A

272
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
SWEATSHIRT WHILE HIGH ON METH IN

273
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
AUGUST.

274
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I TEXTED HIM BEFORE THE HEARING

275
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
TODAY, ASKING IF HE WOULD

276
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
ATTEND.
HE ANSWERED, NOT FEELING LIKE

277
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
GOING TO JAIL AND THEY WOULD

278
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
TAKE ME IF I SHOWED.

279
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I CAN'T GET PAST THIS.

280
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
THE CONNECTION HER AND I HAD WAS

281
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
SO STRONG.

282
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
LAST NIGHT I SLEPT ON THE

283
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
STREETS AGAIN.

284
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I LOST EVERYTHING BECAUSE OF HER

285
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
AND THE LIFE SHE FORCED ME INTO.

286
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
THIS HOLE I'M IN IS SO DEEP, I

287
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
CAN'T GET OUT OF.

288
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
IN THE PAST I COULD PULL MYSELF

289
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
TOGETHER.
I CAN'T FIND THAT STRENGTH IN

290
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
ME.

291
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
IT'S JUST NOT THERE.

292
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
WHAT IS THERE INSTEAD IS A

293
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
WELCOMING THAT MY END WILL BE

294
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
SOON.
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.

295
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I TRIED TO CALL HIM SEVERAL

296
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
TIMES TO SEE IF HE'S OKAY AND

297
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
JUST GOT HIS VOICE MAIL.

298
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'M POSTING SCREEN SHOTS OF

299
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
THOSE TEXTS AT ABC7NEWS.COM.

300
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
>> BY THE WAY, NADIA IS STILL

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
FACING DRUG AND CHILD

ENDANGERMENT CHARGES IN SOUTHERN

303

CALIFORNIA, BUT HER LAWYER SAYS

304
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
THE CASE MAY BE DROPPED IF SHE

305
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
CONTINUES TO DO WELL IN REHAB.

306
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000

307
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
THANKS.

AWARENESS CAMPAIGN.

HIS JOB.

345
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
TODAY EVERYONE I TALKED TO

346
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
INSISTED THIS ISN'T POLITICAL.

347
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
>> WE ARE BOTH AN OUTSPOKEN,

348
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
ADVOCATES AND WE SHARE A STRONG

349
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000

DURING THE HOLIDAYS.

357
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
THERE IS A LOT OF DEPRESSION

358
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
THAT GOES ALONG WITH HOLIDAYS

359
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

360
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
SO PEACE AT HOME IS A CAMPAIGN

DAVID CURE AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY

372
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
HAVE ALL BEEN PART OF THE PUSH

373
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
TO GET RID OF THE SHERIFF AFTER

374
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
HE BRUISED HIS WIFE'S ARM DURING

375
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
AN ARGUMENT LAST NEW YEAR'S EVE.

376
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
TODAY DAVID CHIOU AND THE D.A.

377
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
BOTH SAID TODAY'S PUSH ISN'T

378
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
ABOUT THAT.

379
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
>> THIS IS REALLY ABOUT

380
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
PROTECTING VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC

381
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
VIOLENCE.

382
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
>> THE NUMBER OF CALLS TO OUR

383
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
HOT LINES INCREASED BY 37%.

384
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS

386
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
CAMPAIGN IS NEEDED BECAUSE THE

387
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
NUMBERS ARE GOING THE WRONG WAY.

388
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
THIS YEAR THERE HAS BEEN MORE

389
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
COVERAGE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

390
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
ISSUES BECAUSE OF THE CASE THAN

391
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
SAN FRANCISCO EXPERTS SAY

392
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
THEY'VE SEEN IN, WELL, MAYBE

393
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
FOREVER.

394
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
>> CERTAINLY THE MESSAGE HAS

395
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
BEEN AMPLIFIED FROM CITY HALL

396
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
AND WE'RE GLAD TO SEE IT BECAUSE

397
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
WE SEE IT EVERY DAY FOR 30

398
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
YEARS.

399
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
>> Reporter: WE CAUGHT UP WITH
THE SHERIFF IN FRONT OF THE

400
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
WOMEN'S RESOURCE CENTER WHERE HE

401
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
WAS TAKING PART IN THE SHERIFF'S

402
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
TOY DRIVE AND I ASKED IF THE

403
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
MAYOR OR THE D.A. HAD CHANGED

404
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
THEIR OPPOSITION TO WORKING WITH

405
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
HIM ON THEIR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

406
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
CAMPAIGN.

407
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
>> THERE HASN'T BEEN A
CONVERSATION BY THEM, BUT I

408
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
CONTINUE TO HAVE DIRECTLY WITH

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
ME.

410
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
BUT I CONTINUE TO REACH OUT TO

411
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
THEM.

412
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
>> Reporter: THE SHERIFF SAYS HE
ISN'T ABOUT TO RESIGN AND HE

413
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
ISN'T PAYING ATTENTION TO NEW

414
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
EFFORTS TO HAVE HIM RECALLED.

THESE TIDES OCCUR WHEN THE SUN,

MOON AND EARTH ARE IF ALIGNMENT.

422
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
SOME SAY CLIMATE CHANGE WILL

423
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
MAKE HIGH WATER EVENTS LIKE

424
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
THESE MORE COMMON.

425
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
>> OPEN A CONVERSATION IN A WAY

426
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
WHERE IT'S NO LONGER POLARIZED,

427
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
IT BECOMES A CONVERSATION OF

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
>> YEAH, IT IS.

446
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000

A LITTLE LOWER THAN TODAY, BUT

451
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
WE STILL COULD SEE SOME FLOODING

452
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
CONCERNS TOMORROW MORNING.

453
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
WE ALSO HAVE FREEZING COLD

454
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
CONDITIONS COMING.

455
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
>> OH, YEAH.

WE'RE HEADED THERE AGAIN.

465
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
TONIGHT IT IS CLEAR.

466
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
WE DO HAVE SOME CLOUDS COMING IN

467
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
AHEAD OF THE NEXT STORM.

468
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
SO FIRST WE'RE GOING TO DEAL

469
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
WITH THE COLD, THEN THE WET.

470
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
HERE IS A LOOK AT LIVE DOPPLER

7HD.

472
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
WE HAD AN ISOLATED SHOWER

473
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
EARLIER.
IT'S NOW GONE.

474
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
BUT THIS DOPPLER WILL BE

475
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
TRACKING RAIN HEADING INTO

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
TOMORROW MORNING.

477
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
LOOK AT THE TEMPERATURES NOW

478
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
AFTER THE HIGHS AND THE LOWS TO

479
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
UPPER 50S.

480
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
NUMBERS ARE DROPPING FAST.

481
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
ANOTHER FROSTY NIGHT INLAND.

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
LIGHT RAIN TOMORROW, BIGGER

487
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
STORMS ARE DUE IN NEXT WEEK.

488
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE FROST

489
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
IT GOES INTO EFFECT AT 2:00 A.M.

491
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
TOMORROW.

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
RUNS UNTIL 8 A.M

493
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
IT'S REALLY FOR THE EAST BAY AND

494
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
SALINAS VALLEY.

495
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
PATCHY FOG, COUNT ON FROSTY

496
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
WINDSHIELD.

497
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
SLIPPERY ON THE SIDEWALKS DUE TO

498
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
THE PATCHES OF FROST.

499
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
YOU'LL WANT TO BUNDLE UP WHEN

500
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
YOU HEAD OUT IN THE MORNING AND

501
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR RAIN

502
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
GEAR WITH YOU.

503
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
HERE IS HOW IT WILL PLAY OUT.

504
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
DOWN TO FREEZING IN LIVERMORE,

508
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
36 IN FREMONT.

509
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
THE CLOUDS THAT ARE COMING IN

510
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
AHEAD OF THE STORM WILL ACTUALLY

511
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
HELP TO HOLD THE TEMPERATURES UP

512
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
JUST A LITTLE BIT COMPARED TO

513
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
LAST NIGHT.
SO KEEP THAT IN MIND.

514
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
BUT IT WILL START TO GET WET AS

515
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
WE HEAD INTO TOMORROW.

516
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
HERE IS A LOOK AT THE SYSTEM FOR

THIS ONE ALSO COMING OUT OF THE

GULF OF ALASKA.

520
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN ON FRIDAY.

521
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
CERTAINLY IS GOING TO BE ON THE

522
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
COLD SIDE.

523
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
SERIES OF STORMS LINING UP OVER

524
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS.

525
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
YOU WILL NEED THE RAIN GEAR AS

526
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000

5:00 A.M, JUST CLOUDS.

530
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
AS WE HEAD INTO 8:00  O'CLOCK

531
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000

DROPS DEVELOP NEAR THE COAST.

533
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
AND THIS IS JUST GOING TO BE

534
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
HEADING INTO THE AFTERNOON, A

535
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
CHANCE OF A FEW SHOWERS.

536
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
NOTICE HERE IT IS NOT THE STORM

537
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
OF THE CENTURY.

538
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
TENTHS OF AN INCH OR LESS

539
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
EXPECTED FOR THIS FIRST SYSTEM.

540
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
REALLY LIGHT AMOUNTS FOR THE

541
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
WEEKEND AS WELL.

542
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
SO HIGHS FOR YOUR FRIDAY,

543
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
CHILLY.
THESE LOOK LIKE LOWS, THEY'RE

544
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
NOT LOWS.

545
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
MID 40S TO THE LOW 50S WITH THE

546
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
LIGHT RAIN ACROSS THE BAY AREA.

547
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
AROUND THE MONTEREY BAY,

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
TEMPERATURES TO REMAIN ON THE

CHILLY SIDE AS WELL.

550
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
UPPER 40S TO THE MID 50S.

551
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
YOU NEED A JACKET AND YOUR RAIN

552
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000

553
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
TEMPERATURES WILL COME UP

554
