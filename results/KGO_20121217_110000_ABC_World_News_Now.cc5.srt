00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
THE GROUP IS DEMANDING TOUGHER

188
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
LAWS RESTRICTING ACCESS TO GUNS

189
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
AND WHO CAN OWN THEM.

190
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY THAT

191
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
DISCUSSION IS COMING, AS
EVIDENCED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA'S

192
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
COMMENTS DURING LAST NIGHT'S

193
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
SERVICE THERE IN NEWTOWN.

194
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
>>> THIS IS THE FOURTH MASS

195
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
SHOOTING SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA

196
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
TOOK OFFICE.

197
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
LAST NIGHT HE MADE IT CLEAR GUN

198
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
CONTROL IS ABOUT TO BECOME A TOP

199
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
PRIORITY OF HIS ADMINISTRATION.
BUT DESPITE NATIONAL OUTRAGE

200
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
AFTER EACH TRAGEDY, THE NUMBER
OF GUNS IN AMERICA IS SOARING.

201
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
HERE'S ABC'S CORRESPONDENT

202
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
PIERRE THOMAS.

203
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
>> Reporter: ON BLACK FRIDAY,

204
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
U.S. SHOPPERS WERE NOT JUST

205
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
BUYING TOYS AND ELECTRONICS,

206
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
THEY WERE ALSO BUYING GUNS IN

207
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
RECORD NUMBERS.

208
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
ON THAT SINGLE DAY, THE FBI DID

209
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
COMPUTERIZED BACKGROUND CHECKS

210
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
ON MORE THAN 154,000 PURCHASES

211
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
OF FIREARMS.

212
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
AND IN NOVEMBER ALONE, AMERICANS

213
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
TRIED TO BUY A WHOPPING 2

214
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
MILLION GUNS.

215
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
HERE ARE SOME FACTS THAT MIGHT

216
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
SURPRISE YOU.

217
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
THERE ARE MORE REGISTERED GUN
DEALERS AND STORES THAN MAJOR

218
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
SUPERMARKETS.

219
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
MORE GUN SELLERS THAN McDONALD'S

220
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
RESTAURANTS.

221
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF GUN
USERS ARE LAW ABIDING CITIZENS.

222
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
BUT AUTHORITIES TELL ABC NEWS

223
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THE MILLIONS OF GUNS ALREADY IN

224
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
CIRCULATION GUARANTEE THAT

225
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
DISTURBED PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO

226
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
OBTAIN THEM.

227
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
EVEN IN QUIET COMMUNITIES LIKE

228
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
NEWTOWN.
WE SPOKE TO THE ATF ON-SCENE

229
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
COMMANDER.

230
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
ROUGHLY HOW MANY GUN DEALERS ARE

231
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
IN THERE AREA?
>> THERE ARE ABOUT 400 GUN

232
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
DEALERS IN A FOUR-COUNTY AREA.

233
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
JUST WITHIN TEN MILES OF THE

234
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
INCIDENT, THERE ARE 36 GUN
DEALERS.

235
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
>> Reporter: POLICE BELIEVE THE

236
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
GUNS ADAM LANZA USED WERE BOUGHT

237
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
LEGALLY.

238
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
>> IN AMERICA, UNLESS YOU HAVE A

239
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
FELONY CONVICTION OR YOU'RE

240
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
ADJUDICATED BY A COURT TO BE
MENTALLY INCOMPETENT, YOU HAVE

241
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
ACCESS TO FIREARMS.

242
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
>> Reporter: LANZA JOINS THE

243
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
RANKS OF MASS SHOOTERS.

244
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
SO HOW DO YOU KEEP WEAPONS FROM

245
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
MEN LIKE THESE, WHEN THERE ARE

246
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
AN ESTIMATED 200 MILLION PLUS

247
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
GUNS ALREADY IN CIRCULATION?

248
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
PIERRE THOMAS, ABC NEWS.

249
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
>>> LAWMAKERS AND ADVOCATES FOR

250
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
GUN CONTROL HAVE WASTED NO TIME

251
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
FOR SPEAKING OUT.

252
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
BUT FOR NOW, THE NATIONAL RIFLE
ASSOCIATION SEEMS TO BE SILENT

253
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
THE SOCIAL MEDIA SAVVY GROUP HAS

254
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
NOT TWEETED OR POSTED ANYTHING

255
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
ON ITS FACEBOOK PAGE SINCE THE

256
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
CONNECTICUT SHOOTINGS.
IN FACT, THE NRA'S FACEBOOK PAGE

257
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
WAS TAKEN DOWN A DAY AFTER IT

258
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
BOASTED REACHING 1.7 MILLION
LIKES.

259
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
>> I WAS WATCHING SOME OF THE

260
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
SUNDAY SHOWS AND THERE WAS ONE

261
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
PROGRAM WHERE THEY SAID THEY

262
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
INVITED 31 PRO-GUN RIGHT

263
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
SENATORS ON THE SHOW TO BE PART

264
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
OF THE PANEL DISCUSSION AND NOT

265
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
A SINGLE ONE ACCEPTED THE
INVITATION.

266
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
>> THAT'S REMARKABLE TO ME.

267
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
>> IT IS.

268
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
>> TYPICALLY, THE REACTION WHEN

269
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS IS

270
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
WELL, IF THERE WERE MORE GUNS,

271
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
THEN THIS TYPE OF THING WOULDN'T

272
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
HAPPEN.

273
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE SECURITY

274
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
GUARD AT THE SCHOOL HAD A GUN,

275
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

276
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
IF THE TEACHERS HAD GUNS, THIS

277
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

278
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
SO I'M SURPRISED THE NRA HAS

279
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
BEEN SO SILENT.

280
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
THESE GUN ENTHUSIASENTHUSIASTS,

281
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
SURPRISED THEY HAVE BEEN SILENT.

282
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
>> I THINK THEY KNOW ALL THE PRO

283
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
GUN RIGHTS THAT OBVIOUSLY FOR

284
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
CLEAR REASONS, EMOTIONS ARE RAW

285
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
RIGHT NOW.

286
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
TEMPERS ARE HIGH, FRUSTRATION IS

287
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
HIGH.

288
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
AND SO THEY'RE LAYING LOW.

289
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
BUT THE THING IS, THE PRESIDENT
MADE IT VERY CLEAR.

290
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
SOME LEGISLATION IS COMING.

291
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
WHETHER IT SUCCEEDS OR NOT IS A

292
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
QUICKLY.

370

372

373
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
BRAVE?

374
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
>> I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

375
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
OUTSIDE OF DIVINE INTERVENTION.

376
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000

378
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
DAD DOING?

379
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
>> I THINK AS WELL AS YOU CAN

380
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
EXPECT THEM TO DO.

381
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
>> Reporter: AND THEY MUST BE

382
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
RELIEVED TO HAVE THEIR CHILD.

383
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND --

384
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
>> YES, THE MOM TOLD ME, AND I
THOUGHT THIS WAS VERY

385
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
INSIGHTFUL, THAT SHE WAS

386
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
SUFFERING FROM WHAT SHE CALLED

387
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
SURVIVOR'S GUILT.

388
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
BECAUSE SO MANY OF HER FRIENDS

389
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
NO LONGER HAVE THEIR CHILDREN

390
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
LONGER HAVE TRS.
HILDREN

391
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
BUT SHE HAS HERS.

392
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
>>> MANY STUDENTS MAY BE ANXIOUS

393
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

394
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
SO WHAT SHOULD PARENTS SAY AND

395
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
DO TO CALM THOSE FEARS?

396
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US

400
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000

401
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
>> IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE.

402
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
>> WE HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS, OF

403
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
COURSE.
I'M A PARENT.

404
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I HAVE A FIRST GRADER AND A

405
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
FIFTH GRADER.

406
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I STRUGGLED WITH WHETHER OR NOT

407
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
TO SPEAK TO BOTH OF THEM.

408
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
CAN YOU TELL OUR VIEWERS WHAT

409
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
AGE IS APPROPRIATE TO DISCUSS

410
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
THIS TERRIBLE TRAGEDY?

411
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO DEPEND

412
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
ON THE PARTICULAR CHILD, BUT AT
LEAST 5 YEARS OF AGE IS THE

413
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
FIRST TIME YOU TALK TO THEM.

414
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
ONE OF THE THINGS WE LIKE IS FOR

415
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
PARENTS TO BREAK THE NEWS TO THE

416
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
KIDS.

417
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
SAY SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED

418
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
IN A SCHOOL, VERY FAR AWAY, NOT

419
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
SO FAR AWAY, AND BECAUSE THIS

420
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
TERRIBLE THING HAPPENED WHERE

421
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
KIDS WERE VERY BADLY HURT,

422
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
SCHOOL IS GOING TO BE SAFER NOW,

423
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
WHERE THERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE

424
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
PRECAUTIONS AT SCHOOL.

425
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
BUT TAKE THE CUE FROM THE CHILD,

426
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
SO YOUR INDIVIDUAL CHILD MIGHT

427
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
WANT TO KNOW MORE OR LESS, BUT

428
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T FORCE
THIS.

429
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
IT'S NICE FOR THEM TO KNOW YOU

430
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
TOLD THEM ABOUT IT, AND THEY

431
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
KNOW THAT THEY CAN KEEP COMING

432
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
BACK TO ASK MORE QUESTIONS.

433
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE CHILD THAT IS

434
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
AFRAID TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL ON

435
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
MONDAY MORNING?

436
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
>> I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

437
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

438
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
THAT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

439
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
TO REASSURE THEM AND TELL THEM

440
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
ABOUT THE SAFETY OF YOUR SCHOOL,

441
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
HOW RARE THESE KIND OF EVENTS
ARE.

442
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
AND IF NECESSARY, YOU'RE GOING

443
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
TO CHANGE YOUR SCHEDULE AROUND

444
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
AND DRIVE YOUR CHILD TO SCHOOL

445
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
OR WALK YOUR CHILD TO SCHOOL,

446
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
OR WALK YOUR CHILD TO SCHOOL

447
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

448
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
THAT WE WANT TO MODEL RESILIENCE

449
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
AND WE WANT OUR CHILDREN TO BE

450
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
RESILIENT.

451
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
WE DON'T WANT THIS TERRIBLE

452
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
EVENT TO HAVE MORE NEGATIVE

453
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
EVENTS ON CHILDREN WHO WON'T GO

454
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
BACK TO SCHOOL, BECAUSE GETTING

455
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
BACK INTO A ROUTINE IS ONE OF

456
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
THE BEST THINGS WE CAN DO FOR

457
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
CHILDREN.

458
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
>> WHAT IF YOU SEE, OR WHAT ARE

459
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
THE SIGNS OF TRAUMA IN A CHILD?

460
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
ALTHOUGH PARENTS I BELIEVE

461
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
CERTAINLY KNOW THEIR CHILDREN,

462
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
WE MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THE

463
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
SIGNS OF TRAUMA.

464
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
SO WHAT SHOULD WE BE LOOKING

465
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
FOR?

466
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
>> I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT.

467
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LISTENING

468
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
TO YOUR CHILD EVEN WHEN THEY'RE

469
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
NOT TALKING.

470
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
IF YOU HAVE A GREAT SLEEPER,

471
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
THEN THEY WANT TO SLEEP IN YOUR

472
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
BED OR THEY ARE VERY IRRITABLE

473
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
OR THEIR APITUTE HAS CHANGED OR

474
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
YOUR CHILD HAS MANY WORRIES THEY

475
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
NEVER HAD BEFORE THESE ARE THE

476
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
BEGINNING SIGNS OF AN ANXIETY

477
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
REACTION AND WE SHOULD WATCH
THAT.

478
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
BECAUSE IN A FEW WEEKS FROM NOW,

479
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
IF THESE THINGS DON'T DISAPPEAR,

480
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
THAT'S WHEN WE CALL IT TRAUMATIC

481
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
STRESS DISORDER.

482
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
>> LET'S SAY WE SEE THAT.

483
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
WHERE DO WE GET HELP FOR OUR

484
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
CHILDREN?

485
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
>> I THINK EVERY PARENT HAS TO

486
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
KNOW THEY COULD REACH OUT TO

487
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
THEIR PEDIATRICIAN.

488
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
THEY SHOULD REACH OUT TO

489
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
WEBSITES LIKE CHILDSMIND.ORG

490
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000

SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND
INFORMATION.

492
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
AND IF THEY STILL HAVE WORRIES,

493
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
THAT'S WHEN YOU MAKE AN

494
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR DOCTOR AND

495
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
ASK THEM TWO WEEKS, THREE WEEKS

WITH TERRIBLE SYMPTOMS THAT

500

736
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
YOUNG CHILDREN TAKEN FROM THEIR

737
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
FAMILIES.

738
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
>> CHARLOTTE, DANIEL, OLIVIA,

AVIELLE, ALLISON.

744
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
GOD HAS CALLED THEM ALL HOME.

745
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
>> ALL SCHOOLS IN NEWTOWN WILL

746
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
REMAIN CLOSED TODAY.

747
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
SOME SCHOOLS ELSEWHERE IN

748
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
CONNECTICUT PLAN TO HAVE

749
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
COUNSELORS AVAILABLE WHEN
STUDENTS ARRIVE FOR CLASS LATER

750
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
THIS MORNING.

751
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
YOU WONDER HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE

752
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
FOR ANY SENSE OF NORMALCY TO GET

753
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
BACK TO THAT TOWN.

754
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING ABOUT
THE FACILITY ITSELF, OBVIOUSLY,

755
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
SANDY HOOK IS NOT GOING TO BE

756
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
OPEN FOR A WHILE.

757
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
IT'S STILL A CRIME SCENE HERE.

758
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
THOSE KIDS WILL GO BACK TO

759
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
SCHOOL ON TUESDAY, BUT IN A

760
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
DIFFERENT CAMPUS AS PART OF THAT
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

761
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
WHO KNOWS FOR HOW LONG?

762
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
THOSE KIDS WILL NOT BE RETURNING

763
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
THERE ON TUESDAY.

764
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME OTHER

765
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
PLANS.
>> THERE'S NO WAY.

766
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
THEY COULDN'T POSSIBLY.

767
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I THINK WHAT'S FASCINATING IS

768
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
THAT IT HAS AFFECTED, AS YOU

769
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
MENTIONED EARLIER, EVERYONE IN

770
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
OUR COUNTRY.

771
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
OUTSIDE OF OUR COUNTRY, IN A WAY

772
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE 9/11.

773
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
EVERYONE FELT THIS TRAGEDY SO

774
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
PERSONALLY IN SO MANY WAYS.

775
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
EVEN MY -- THE SCHOOL MY

776
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
CHILDREN GO TO, WE GOT SO MANY

777
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
E-MAILS FROM THE PRINCIPAL, FROM

778
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
THE FIRST GRADE TEACHERS, THE

779
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
FIFTH GRADE TEACHERS, ASKING US

780
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
HOW WE WERE, WHAT WE WERE GOING

781
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
TO BE TALKING TO OUR CHILDREN

782
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
ABOUT, WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO

783
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
BE DOING ON MONDAY.

784
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
BECAUSE IT HAS AFFECTED EVERY

785
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
SINGLE FAMILY IN THE COUNTRY.

786
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
>> YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THAT EVERY

787
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
SINGLE SCHOOL IN THE COUNTRY IS

788
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THIS IN

789
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
SOME WAY WITH THEIR STUDENTS

790
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
COMING BACK TO CLASS TODAY AND

791
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
MAYBE LOOK AT THEIR OWN SECURITY
PROCEDURES.

792
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
THE RIPPLE EFFECTS ARE

793
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
BOUNDLESS.

794
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
>> UNBELIEVABLE.

795
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
>>> THE GUNMAN ADAM LANZA HAD

796
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS AND USED

797
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
MULTIPLE HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES

798
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
WHEN HE WENT TO THE SCHOOL

799
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
ACCORDING TO POLICE.

800
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
ABC'S DAN HARRIS HAS NEW DETAILS

801
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
ABOUT THE DEADLY PATH LANZA TOOK

802
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

803
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
>> Reporter: AFTER ADAM LANZA

804
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
SHOT HIS WAY THROUGH THE GLASS

805
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
NEAR THE FRONT ENTRANCE OF THE

806
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
SCHOOL ON FRIDAY AT AROUND 9:40

807
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
A.M., HE HAD CHOICES.

808
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
LANZA COULD HAVE GONE TO THE

809
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
RIGHT, TO THE CAFETERIA, WHERE,
ACCORDING TO THE HARTFORD

810
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
NEWSPAPER, STUDENTS WERE
REHEARSING A PLAY.

811
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
STRAIGHT AHEAD TO THE

812
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE OR LEFT

813
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
TOWARD THE FIRST GRADE

814
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
CLASSROOMS.

815
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
HE WENT LEFT AND ENCOUNTERED THE

816
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
PRINCIPAL AND A SCHOOL

817
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
PSYCHOLOGIST, WHO, AS WE KNOW,

818
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
LOCAL OFFICIALS SAY DIED TRYING

819
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
TO STOP LANZA.

820
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
IN THE FIRST CLASSROOM LANZA

821
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
ENTERED HE SHOT AND KILLED

822
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
LAUREN RUSSEAU, A SUBSTITUTE

823
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
TEACHER, AND 15 FIRST GRADERS,

824
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
ALL BUT ONE OF THE STUDENTS.
THEN HE WENT TO THE CLASSROOM OF

825
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
VICTORIA SOTO WHO WAS HIDING THE

826
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
STUDENTS.

827
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
SOTO TRIED TO CONVINCE LANZA THE

828
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
KIDS WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

829
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
THE BUILDING, BUT WHEN A GROUP

830
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
OF STUDENTS TRIED TO GET AWAY,

831
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
LANZA SHOT THEM, SOTO, AND A

832
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
SPECIAL ED TEACHER.

833
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
IT WAS ONLY AFTER POLICE ARRIVED

834
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
THAT THEY FOUND OTHER STUDENTS.

835
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
THE PAPER SAYS THEY WERE HIDDEN

836
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
IN A CLOSET.

837
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
THE GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT TOLD

838
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
ABC'S GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS THE

839
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
RAMPAGE ONLY ENDED AROUND 9:50,

840
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
ABOUT TEN MINUTES AFTER IT BEGAN

841
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
WHEN LANZA HEARD THE SIRENS

842
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
APPROACHING AND KILLED HIMSELF

843
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
WITH ONE BULLET TO THE HEAD.

844
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
>> WE SURMISE THAT IT WAS DURING

845
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
THE SECOND CLASSROOM EPISODE

846
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THAT HE HEARD RESPONDERS COMING

847
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
AND APPARENTLY DECIDED TO TAKE

848
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
HIS OWN LIFE.

849
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
>> Reporter: SCHOOL OFFICIALS

850
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
ANNOUNCED THE SURVIVING STUDENTS

851
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
FROM SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY WILL

852
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
IN A MATTER OF DAYS START

853
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
ATTENDING CLASSES AT AN UNUSED

854
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
SCHOOL IN A NEIGHBORING TOWN.

855
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
AFTER THAT, THOUGH, THERE'S A

856
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
WRENCHING DECISION TO BE MADE --

857
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
DO THEY EVER REOPEN SANDY HOOK

858
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
ELEMENTARY?

859
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
DAN HARRIS, ABC NEWS IN NEWTOWN,

860
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
CONNECTICUT.

861
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
>> NO EASY ANSWER ON THAT ONE.

862
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
SCHOOLS AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE

863
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
NOW REVIEWING SECURITY IN LIGHT

864
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
OF THE TRAGEDY.

865
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
ADMINISTRATORS HAVE PLEDGED TO

866
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
HAVE EXTRA POLICE AND GUIDANCE

867
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
COUNSELORS ON HAND AS STUDENTS

868
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM FOR THE

869
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
FIRST TIME SINCE THE SHOOTING.

870
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
THE NEWTOWN SCHOOL DISTRICT

871
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
DECIDED TO SPEND TEN TIMES MORE

872
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
ON SECURITY TRAINING FOR STAFF

873
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
MEMBERS THIS YEAR, TRAINING THAT

874
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
MAY HAVE LIMITED THE DAMAGE.
>> YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN

875
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
AMOUNT OF FIRE DRILLS AND

876
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
EVACUTION DRILLS AND LOCKDOWN

877
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
DRILLS SO THE KIDS KNOW THE

878
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
ROUTINE AND THE TEACHERS KNOW

879
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
THE ROUTINE AND EVERYONE HAS A

880
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
SPOT WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO
GO TO.

881
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
>> THE POLICE CHIEF SAYS HE

882
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
PLANS TO STEP UP PATROL OF THE

883
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
CITY'S ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE

884
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
SCHOOLS BY ASSIGNING OFFICERS TO

885
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
VISIT THEM AT LEAST ONCE A DAY.

886
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
AGAIN, THOSE ARE THE RIPPLE
EFFECTS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

887
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
HOW YOU AS A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR

888
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
PRINCIPAL, HOW CAN YOU LOOK AT

889
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
THIS TRAGEDY AND NOT PERHAPS
REVIEW YOUR OWN SECURITY

890
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
PROCEDURES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

891
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I MEAN, I REMEMBER DOING FIRE

892
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
DRILLS.

893
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER THE SAME

894
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
THING.

895
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
BUT THESE LOCKDOWNS, I DON'T --

896
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I NEVER PARTICIPATED IN THAT.

897
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
>> BUT THEY DID IT AT SCHOOL.

898
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
TEACHERS SAID THANK GOD WE DID

899
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
THIS, BECAUSE THEY KNEW WHERE TO

900
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
HIDE AND WHERE TO GO.

901
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
AND THIS DETAIL TOO IS CHILLING

902
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
TO THINK ABOUT.

903
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
APPARENTLY THE GUNMAN FIRST

904
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
ENTERED A KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM
AND IT WAS EMPTY.

905
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
HE THOUGHT IT WAS EMPTY, BUT THE

906
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
KIDS WERE IN A BATHROOM AREA

907
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
WHERE THE TEACHER HAD TAKEN

908
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
THEM.

909
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I GUESS IT WAS A BATHROOM BREAK

910
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
OR WHAT HAVE YOU.

911
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
AFTER THINKING THAT ROOM WAS

912
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
EMPTY, HE WENT INTO THAT FIRST

913
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
GRADE CLASSROOM WHERE HE

914
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
PROCEEDED TO KILL 15 OF THE 16

915
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
STUDENTS.

916
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
BUT HAD THOSE KINDERGARTEN KIDS

917
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
BEEN IN THAT ROOM, THE DEATH

918
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
TOLL COULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER AND

919
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
THE VICTIMS EVEN YOUNGER THAN
THE 6 AND 7-YEAR-OLDS.

920
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
>> I CAN'T WRAP MY BRAIN AROUND

921
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
IT.

922
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
>> NO ONE CAN.

923
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
IT'S A LEVEL OF EVIL AND

924
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
SICKNESS YOU CAN'T PROCESS.

925
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

926
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000

928
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
THE POLICE FORCE IS IN SHOCK

929
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
AFTER TWO OF ITS OFFICERS WERE

930
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
SHOT AND KILLED.
BOTH THE MEN WERE SHOT IN THE

931
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000

OUTSIDE A GROCERY STORE.

934

NOW THERE'S A MANHUNT FOR THE

AND EQUIPMENT.

944
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
A POLICE DOG FOLLOWED THEIR

945
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
TRAIL TO THE HOME DEPOT.

946
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000

18-YEAR-OLD SAMMY CHAVEZ WAS

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
ARRESTED LATE LAST WEEK.

POLICE SAY CHAVEZ WANTED TO GET

ALL STUDENTS INTO THE AUDITORIUM

954
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
AND THEN START SHOOTING THEM

955

ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE, HE LISTED

958
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
KILLING PEOPLE AS A FAVORITE.

HUGE SPIKE IN THE AFTERMATH OF

HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.

968
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
MANY OF THEM SAID THEY TURNED

969
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
OVER THEIR WEAPONS BECAUSE THEY

970
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
WERE MOVED BY THE CONNECTICUT

971
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
TRAGEDY.

972
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
>> I FEEL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

973
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
MIGHT HURT SOMEBODY SOME DAY,

YOU KNOW, THEN I WOULD FEEL

975
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
TERRIBLE ABOUT THAT.

976
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
>> WHEN THE COMMUNITY SAYS

977
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, I THINK YOU'VE

978
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
GOT A GOOD CHANCE OF SOMETHING

979
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
LIKE THIS.

FOR EACH WEAPON THEY BROUGHT IN.

982
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
THERE WERE SIMILAR BUYBACKS IN

983
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK AND

984
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
WASHINGTON, D.C. AND IN PRINCE

GEORGE'S COUNTY, MARYLAND.

986
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
>> YOU THINK ABOUT THE

987
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
STAGGERING NUMBER.

988
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
THERE ARE MORE THAN 200 MILLION

AMERICA.

991
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
SO ONE, THAT QUESTIONS HOW

992
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
EFFECTIVE ANY GUN CONTROL COULD

993
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
BE.

994
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
IT SEEMS LIKE THE GENIE IS WAY

995
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
OUT OF THE BOTTLE.

996
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I GUESS EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS,

997
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
SO SOME OF THOSE BUYBACK

998

New Lysol Power & Free has more

1012
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
cleaning power than bleach.

1013

How?

1014
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
The secret
is the hydrogen peroxide
formula.

1015
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
It attacks tough stains

1016
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
and kills 99.9% of germs.

Powerful cleaning that's
family friendly.

CONCUSSION, AS WELL AS A STOMACH

1046
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
VIRUS.
IN FACT, THE TWO ARE RELATED.

1047
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS THE

DEHYDRATED AND FAINTED AT HER
HOME.

1052
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
SHE APPARENTLY HIT HER HEAD,

1053
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
BECAUSE OFFICIALS SAY SHE

1054
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
SUFFERED A CONCUSSION.
IT'S THE SECOND TIME IN EIGHT

1055
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
YEARS SHE'S FAINTED BECAUSE OF A
STOMACH BUG.

1056
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
BUT SHE'S GENERALLY HEALTHY, AS

1057
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
SHE TOLD BARBARA WALTERS WHO

1058
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000

BEFORE BOTH HOUSES ON THURSDAY.

1078
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000

DEPUTIES WILL FILL IN.

1080
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
NOT GOOD ENOUGH SAID THE

1081
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
REPUBLICAN CHAIR OF THE HOUSE
COMMITTEE, WHO SAID THIS

1082
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
REQUIRES A PUBLIC APPEARANCE BY

1083
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
THE SECRETARY OF STATE HERSELF.

1084
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
BUT THAT MAY NEVER HAPPEN.
ABC NEWS LEARNED THE PRESIDENT

1085
