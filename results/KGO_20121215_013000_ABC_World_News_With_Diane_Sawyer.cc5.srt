00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
15 SMALL CHILDREN INTO A TINY

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
BATHROOM TO TRY TO SAVE THEIR

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
LIVES.

190
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
>> I PUT ONE OF MY STUDENTS ON

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
TOP, I KNEW WE HAD TO GET IN

192
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
THERE, I TOLD THEM IT'S GOING TO

193
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
BE OKAY.

194
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

195
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I PULLED A BOOK SHELF IN FRONT

196
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
OF IT SO WE WERE COMPLETELY

197
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
BARRICADED IN.
I TURNED THE LIGHTS OFF.

198
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
>> Reporter: DID YOU TELL THEM

199
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
TO BE QUIET?

200
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
DID YOU WORRY --

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
>> I TOLD THEM TO BE QUIET,

202
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
ABSOLUTELY QUIET.

203
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
BECAUSE I WAS JUST SO AFRAID IF

204
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
HE CAME IN AND HEAR US AND START

205
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
SHOOTING THE DOOR.
I SAID WE HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTELY

206
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
QUIET AND WE HAVE -- I SAID

207
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
THERE ARE BAD GUYS OUT THERE AND

208
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
WE NEED TO WAIT FOR THE GOOD

209
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
GUYS.
I WANTED US TO BE OKAY.

210
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
AND I WAS SO SADDENED THERE WERE

211
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
PEOPLE WHO IN THIS SITUATION ARE

212
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
NOT OKAY.

213
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO ANYONE

214
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
WHO KNEW THEM AND WAS PART OF

215
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THEIR LIVES.

216
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

217
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
>> Reporter: DID THEY CRY?

218
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
>> IF THEY STARTED CRYING I

219
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
WOULD TAKE THEIR FACE AND SAY

220
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY, SHOW ME

221
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
YOUR SMILE.
I REALLY TRIED -- ONE OF MY

222
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
STUDENTS WOULD SAY LIKE I KNOW

223
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
CAKARAT

224
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
KARATE, I'LL LEAD THE WAY OUT.

225
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
>> Reporter: THEY REALLY SAID TO

226
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
YOU, WE WANT TO GO HOME FOR

227
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
CHRISTMAS?
>> OH, YEAH.

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I JUST WANT TO HUG MY MOM,

229
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THINGS LIKE THAT, THAT WERE

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
JUST, IT'S HEARTBREAKING.

231
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
BECAUSE YOU'RE HEARING -- I'VE

232
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
NEVER BEEN PART OF SOMETHING

233
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
ANYWHERE NEAR THIS TRAUMATIC AND

234
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
SO I'M HEARING THE GUNFIRE IN

235
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
THE HALLWAY, I'M IN THE FIRST

236
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
CLASSROOM.
WHY ISN'T HE COMING?

237
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'M THINKING WE'RE NEXT.

238
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
IN MY MIND I'M THINKING, AS A

239
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
6-YEAR-OLD, 7-YEAR-OLD, WHAT ARE

240
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
YOUR THOUGHTS?

241
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
AND THINKING THAT I HAVE TO

242
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
ALMOST BE THEIR PARENT, I HAVE

243
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
TO TELL THEM -- I SAID I NEED

244
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL LOVE YOU

245
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
ALL VERY MUCH AND THAT IT'S

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
GOING TO BE OKAY.

247
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I NOW THE THAT WAS THE LAST

248
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THING THEY WERE EVER GOING TO

249
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
HEAR.
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL GOING TO

250
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
DIE.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S OKAY,

251
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
TEACHERS, I WANTED THEM TO KNOW

252
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
SOMEONE LOVED THEM AND I WANTED

253
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THAT TO BE ONE OF THE LAST

254
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
THINGS THEY HEARD, NOT THE G

255
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
GUNFIRE IN THE HALLWAY.

256
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
SO HORRIBLE.

257
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
HORRIBLE.

258
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE.
>> Reporter: HOW DID YOU KNOW

259
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
YOU WERE GOING TO BE OKAY?

260
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
>> I DIDN'T.

261
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
STOPPED, IT WASN'T THAT LONG,

00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
SO, EVEVENEVENTUALLY THE POLICE

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
PUT YOUR BADGES UNDER THE DOOR.

271
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
THEY PUT THEIR BADGES UNDER THE

272
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
DOOR.
I SAID IF YOU'RE REALLY A POLICE

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
HAD BEEN TRAINED TO REACT TO A

546
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
THREAT, NEVER EXPECTING TO USE

547
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
THAT TRAINING.

548
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
ABC'S AMY ROBACH IS WITH US NOW

549
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
AND SHE TELLS US WHAT THE

550
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
TRAINING WAS AND EXACTLY WHAT
THEY DID.

551
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
AMY?

552
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000

MEDICAL STAFF TOLD US THEY

555
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
THOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN A LOT

556
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
LIKE 9/11 BECAUSE THEY HAD THEIR

557
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000

ONLY THREE ARRIVED.

560
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
THE DEATH COUNT UNIMAGINABLE,

561
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
BUT AS YOU MENTIONED, SO MANY

562
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
PEOPLE ARE ATTRIBUTING THAT

563
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
NUMBER TO THE HEROIC ACTS OF
TEACHERS.

564
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THEIR BRAVERY,

565
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
MANY IN THE COMMUNITY BELIEVE

566
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
THAT NUMBER WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN

567
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
HIGHER.

568
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, IT IS THE

571
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
TEACHERS' WORDS THEY FOLLOW DAY
IN AND DAY OUT.

572
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
TODAY, THOSE WORDS MIGHT HAVE

573
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
JUST SAVED THEIR LIFE.

574
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
>> HIS TEACHER WENT AND CHECKED,

575
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
LOCKED AND CLOSED THE DOOR.

576
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
THEY WENT INTO A CORNER UNTIL
THEY WERE RECOVERED BY POLICE.

577
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
>> THE TEACHER PUT THEM IN THE

578
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
CORNER AND THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED

579
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
TO MOVE UNTIL THE POLICE CAME.

>> THEY'RE ALL HEROES.

585
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
>> IT DOES SOUND THAT THE
TEACHERS DID EVERYTHING HUMANLY

586
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
POSSIBLE, DOWN TO RISKING THEIR

587
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
OWN LIVES TO PROTECT THE
CHILDREN IN THIS CONNECTICUT

I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYBODY COULD

ANYTHING TO IMMEDIATELY HELP

617
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000

618
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000

TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE.

>> Reporter: SPEAKING OF

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
POWERLESS, I JUST SPOKE TO ONE

621
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
OF THE DOCTORS HERE WHO WAS AT

622

DANBURY HOSPITAL WHEN THEY

623
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
RECEIVED THE INITIAL CALL OF

624
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
MULTIPLE SHOTS FIRED AT

625
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
THE SCHOOL.
HE AMASSED 80 DOCTORS AND NURSES

626
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
WAITING TO RECEIVE ANY POTENTIAL
VICTIMS AND INJURED.

627
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
WITHIN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES,
THEY GOT THOSE INITIAL THREE

628
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
INJURED AND THEY WERE WAITING

629
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
FOR MORE.
THEY WERE TOLD AS MANY AS TWO

630
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
DOZEN THEY WOULD RECEIVE.

631
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
WITHIN 30 MINUTES WHEN THEY

632
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
DIDN'T SHOW UP, THAT'S WHEN THEY

633
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
FELT THE GRAVITY OF THE

634
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
SITUATION BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY

635
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
WEREN'T COMING, THEY WERE AT THE

636
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
SCHOOL AND WOULD STAY THERE

637
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
FOREVER.

638
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
IT WAS A VERY DISTURBING MOMENT

639
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
FOR ALL OF THEM.

640
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
THEY SAID THEY'RE STILL GOING TO

641
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
BE DEALING WITH THIS OBVIOUSLY
FOR MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME.

642
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
THIS COMMUNITY IS FOREVER
CHANGED.

643
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
NO ONE HERE HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED

644
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000

645
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
>> AND NO ONE IN THE COUNTRY,

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
AMY.

647
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR REPORTING
TONIGHT.

648
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
>>> WHEN WE COME BACK, WE HAVE

649
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
BEEN RECEIVING INCREDIBLE IMAGES

650
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
FROM THIS DAY AND WE'RE GOING TO

651
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
SHOW YOU SOME OF THE LATEST.

652
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
That was ME...

653
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
the day I learned I had
to start insulin

654
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
for my type 2 diabetes.

655
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
ME...

656
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
thinking my only option was the
vial and syringe dad used.

657
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And ME...

658
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
discovering once-daily
Levemir® FlexPen.

659
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
FlexPen® is prefilled.

660
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Doesn't need
refrigeration

661
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
for up to
42 days.

662
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
No drawing from a vial.

663
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Dial the exact dose.

664
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Inject by pushing a button.

665
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
FlexPen® is insulin delivery...

666
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
MY way.

667
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Levemir® (insulin detemir
[rDNA origin] injection)

668
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
is a long-acting insulin

669
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
used to control high blood sugar
in adults and children

670
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
with diabetes and is not
recommended to treat

671
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
diabetic ketoacidosis.

672
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Do not use Levemir® if
you are allergic

673
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
to any of its ingredients.

674
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The most common side effect
is low blood sugar,

675
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
which may cause
symptoms such as sweating,

676
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
shakiness, confusion,
and headache.

677
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Severe low blood sugar can be
serious and life threatening.

678
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Ask your healthcare provider
about alcohol use,

679
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
operating machinery, or driving.

680
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Other possible side
effects include

681
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
injection site reactions.

682
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Tell your healthcare provider
about all medicines you take

683
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
and all of your
medical conditions.

684
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Get medical help right away
if you experience

685
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
serious allergic
reactions, such as body rash,

686
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
trouble with breathing, fast
heartbeat, or sweating.

687
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
With FlexPen®... say good night
to vial and syringe.

688
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Ask your doctor about
Levemir® FlexPen.

689
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Covered by
90% of insurance plans,

690
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000

COOK WHAT YOU LOVE,

BUT HE'LL WORK HIS WAY UP

695

701
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
WHICH ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

702
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.

703
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
FROM TD AMERITRADE.

704
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
THEN I READ AN ARTICLE
ABOUT A STUDY THAT LOOKED

705
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
AT THE LONG TERM HEALTH BENEFITS
OF TAKING MULTIVITAMINS.

706
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
THEY USED CENTRUM SILVER
FOR THE STUDY...

707
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
SO I GUESS MY WIFE WAS RIGHT.
