THAT HAS STAYED ON THAT SCENE

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
FOR THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS.

194
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
STAGING AREA THE POLICE HAVE

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
ESSENTIALLY SET UP.

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
THE SCHOOL IS A LITTLE BIT

198
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
BEHIND ME ACROSS THE FIELDS.

199
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
IT IS ON COMPLETE LOCKDOWN.

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
EVERY STREET IN THIS VERY SMALL

201
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
TOWN OF SANDY HOOK IS SHUT OFF

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
BY THE COPS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

203
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN AS WE

204
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000

205
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
REALLY WANTING TO TALK TO THE

206
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
MEDIA.

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
VERY, VERY UNDERSTANDABLE.

208
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
EVERYONE HERE IS IN A COMPLETE

209
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
STATE OF SHOCK.

210
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
WE DID HEAR SOME REPORTS THAT

211
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
SOME OF THE FIREFIGHTERS --

212
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
THERE IS A FIREHOUSE CLOSE TO

213
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
THE SCHOOL -- SOME OF THE

214
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
FIREFIGHTERS WALKED OUT IN TEARS

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
AND IF IT IS REDUCING GROWN MEN

216
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
TO TEARS YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE

217
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
WHAT THE SMALL CHILDREN WENT

218
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
THROUGH.
MANY WERE LED OUT THROUGH THE

219
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
SCHOOL IN THE IMMEDIATE

220
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
AFTERMATH OF THE SHOTTING BY

221
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THEIR TEACHERS AND BY POLICE.

222
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
THEY WERE TOLD TO COVER THEIR

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
EYES.
ONE CAN ONLY ASSUME THEY WERE

224
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
TOLD TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY

225
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
WERE WALKING AROUND BODIES OF

226
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
KIDS WHO USED TO BE THEIR

227
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
CLASSMATES.

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
THEN I FOUND OUT THAT 26 PEOPLE.

THERE ARE CHILDREN THAT ARE

247
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
UNACCOUNTED FOR AND THEY WILL

248
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
NOT TELL THE PARENTS WHERE THEY

>> SO THERE IS A LOT OF

253
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
CONFUSION.

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
COMMUNITY, WITH NO CRIME.

375
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
HE, SOURCES ARE SAYING, HE WENT

376
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
TO EMERGENCY AND KILL A RELATIVE

377
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
THERE.
THEN HE CAME HERE THIS MORNING

378
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
TO NEWTOWN AND WALKED INTO THE

379
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
MOTHER TEACHES, SHOT AND KILLED

381
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
HER MOTHER AND SHOT AND KILLED

382
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
MOST OF THE CHILDREN IN THE

383
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
CLASSROOM, THE 18 CHILDREN WERE

384
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
IN THE CLASSROOM.

385
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
THE POLICE HAVE RECOVERED TWO

386
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
HANDGUNS AND POSSIBLY A .223

387
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
HIGH CALIBER RIFLE HE MAY HAVE

388
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
USED.
HE WAS WEARING, DRESSED IN BLACK

389
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
WITH BODY ARMOR, AND CARRYING

390
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
THE TWO PISTOLS.

391
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
AFTER HE SHOT HIS MOTHER AND

392
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
KILLED THE CHILDREN IN THAT

393
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM, HE

394
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
WALKED DOWN THE HALLWAY AND AT

395
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
THAT POINT, THIS IS A ONE-LEVEL

396
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
SCHOOL BUILDING, THE PRINCIPAL

397
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
CAME OUT OF THE PRINCIPAL'S

398
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
OFFICE WITH TWO TEACHERS AND AT

399
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
THAT POINT THE ALLEGED GUNMAN

400
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
SHOT AND KILLED THE PRINCIPAL.

401
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
A TOTAL OF 27 PERSONS KILLED, 18

402
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
OF THEM CHILDREN, AND NINE

403
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
ADULTS AND WE HEAR THAT SOME

404
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
CHILDREN MAY ALSO BE IN SERIOUS

405
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
CONDITION AND MAY HAVE ALSO DIED

406
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
SO THE NUMBERS MAY GO UP TO 30

407
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
BUT THAT IS NOT OFFICIALLY

408
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
CONFIRMED.
THAT IS THE SITUATION LIKE IN

409
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

410
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
>> HE WAS STANDING DOWN THE

411
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
STREET FROM THE SCENE AND WE ARE

412
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
SKIPPING OVER A FEW STATES HERE

413
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
AS WE CONTINUE TO WATCH THE

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000

THE CRIME.

415
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
THE MURDERS HAPPENED IN NEWTOWN,

416
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
CONNECTICUT, BUT THE SHOOTER MAY

417
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
HAVE LIVED IN NEW JERSEY, WHERE

418
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
HIS FATHER WAS FOUND KILLED.

419
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
HIS MOTHER ALSO FUND KILLED IN

420
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
NEW STUN CONNECTICUT.

421
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
WE ARE JUST NOW PUTTING TOGETHER

NEWSROOM.
RIGHT NOW, 20 CHILDREN HAVE

424
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
DIED.
THAT IS THE LATEST.

425
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
THAT NUMBER HAS CHANGED THE LAST

426
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
SEVERAL HOURS.

427
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
WE WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU

428
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
UPDATED.

429
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
THE PRESIDENT IS SET TO MAKE

430
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
REMARKS ABOUT THE SHOOTING

431
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
TODAY.

432
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
>> I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE

433
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
GOVERNOR THIS AFTERNOON AND FBI

434
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
DIRECTOR MUELLER.

435
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I OFFERED THE GOVERNOR MY

436
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
CONDOLENCES ON BEHALF OF THE

437
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
NATION AND MADE IT CLEAR HE

438
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
WILL HAVE EVERY SINGLE RESOURCE

439
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
THAT HE NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE

440
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
THIS HEINOUS CRIME, CARE FOR THE

441
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
VICTIMS, COUNSEL THEIR FAMILIES.

442
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
WE HAVE ENDURED TOO MANY OF THE

443
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.

444
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
EACH TIME I LEARN THE NEWS I

445
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
REACT NOT AS A PRESIDENT BUT AS

446
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
ANYONE ELSE WOULD, AS A PARENT.

447
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE TODAY.

448
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I KNOW THERE IS NOT A PARENT IN

449
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

450
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I

451
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
DO.

452
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

453
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

454
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

455
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
THE AGES OF FIVE AND TEN.

456
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIKES

457
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
AHEAD OF THEM: BIRTHDAYS,

458
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
GRADUATIONS, WEDDINGS, KIDS OF

459
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
THEIR OWN.

460
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE TEACHERS

461
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
MEN AND WOMEN WHO DEVELOPED

462
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
THEIR LIVES TO HELP OUR CHILDREN

463
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
FULFILL THEIR DREAMS.

464
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY FOR

465
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
THE PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS AND

466
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
SISTERS AND BROTHERS OF THE

467
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
LITTLE CHILDREN AND FOR THE

468
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
FAMILIES OF THE ADULTS WHO WERE

469
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
LOST.
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

470
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000

472
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

473
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
TONIGHT THEY KNOW THAT THEIR

474
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN

475
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY

476
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
AND THERE ARE IN WORDS THAT WILL

477
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
EASE THEIR PAIN.

478
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
AS A COUNTRY WE HAVE BEEN

479
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000

480
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
WHETHER IT IS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

481
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
IN NEWTOWN OR A MOVIE THEATER IN

482
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
AURORA OR A STREET CORNER IN

483
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
CHICAGO, THE MAINS ARE OUR

484
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE CHILDREN

485
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
ARE OUR CHILDREN.

486
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COME

487
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
FOLK AND TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION

488
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
TO PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES LIKE

489
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
THIS REGARDLESS OF THE POLITICS.

490
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
THIS EVENING, MICHELLE AND I

491
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
DO, HUG OUR CHILDREN TIGHTER AND

493
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
WE WILL TEMPERATURE THEM WE LOVE

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
THEM AND REMIND EACH OTHER HOW

495
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

496
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

497
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CANNOT DO THAT

498
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
TONIGHT.
THEY NEED ALL OF US, RIGHT NOW,

499
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
HIMSELF SEVERAL TIMES IN THE

560
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
REMARKS SAYING OBVIOUSLY THAT HE

561
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
IS REACTING NOT JUST AS A

562
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
PRESIDENT BUT AS A PARENT AS

563
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
MANY OF US OBVIOUSLY ARE ALL

564
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THE

565
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
WORLD.
IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE

566
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
THAT THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT

567
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
DOES GO FORWARD.

568
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
HE MADE VERY CLEAR HE SPOKE TO

569
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
THE GOVERNOR IN CONNECTICUT AND

570
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
HE SPOKE TO THE F.B.I. DIRECTOR,

571
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
ROBERT MUELLER, AND PLEDGED

572
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
EVERY RESOURCE OF THE FEDERAL

573
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
GOVERNMENT WILL BE THERE FOR THE

574
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
FOLKS IN CONNECTICUT, STATE AND

575
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, TO TELL

576
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
WITH THIS TRAGEDY AND HE

577
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
OBVIOUSLY GOT INTO THE EMOTIONAL

578
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
TOLL OF THIS TRAGEDY THAT GOES

579
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
FAR BEYOND WHAT ANY DOLLAR OR

580
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
ANY RESOURCE FROM THE GOVERNMENT

581
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
CAN DEAL WITH BUT IT IS ALSO

582
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
WORTH NOTING AND I WANT TO MAKE

583
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
SURE I QUOTE HIP, HE SAID THAT

584
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
AT SOME POINT WE WILL "COME

585
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
TOGETHER TO TAKE MEANINGFUL

586
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
ACTION REGARDLESS OF POLITICS."

587
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
INTERESTING BECAUSE EARLY TODAY

588
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
AS YOU NOTED JAKE CARNEY WAS

589
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
CAREFUL TO SAY IT IS TOO

590
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
SOON-TO-BE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER

591
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
THERE WILL BE GUN CONTROL

592
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
LEGISLATION IN THE DAYS AND

593
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
MONTHS AHEAD TO DEAL WITH

594
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS, PREVENT

595
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
FUTURE TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS.

596
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T USE

597
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
THE WORDS GUN CONTROL BUT HE

598
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
SAID MEANINGFUL ACTION

599
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
REGARDLESS OF POLITICS IN THE

600
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
DAYS AHEAD.
HE HAS FACED SOME CRITICISM

601
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
AFTER WHAT HE NOTED HAVE BEEN A

602
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
SERIES OF TRAGEDIES DURING THE

603
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
FIRST TERM OF HIS

604
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
ADMINISTRATION.

605
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
HE MENTIONED THE MOVIE THEATER

606
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
IN AURORA, C TEMPLE

607
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
IN WISCONSIN, TUCSON, ARIZONA,

608
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
AS WELL, WITH CONGRESSWOMAN

609
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
GABRIELLE GIFFORDS SHOT AND

610
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
OTHERS LOST THEIR LIBS.

611
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
SHE THANKFULLY SURVIVED.

612
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
YOU COULD TELL THE EMOTIONAL

613
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
TRILLION ON THIS PRESIDENT FROM

614
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
ALL THE TRAGEDIES BUT THIS IN

615
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
PARTICULAR WITH ALL THE

616
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
CHILDREN.
>> WELL PUT.

617
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

618
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE AS WE

619
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
GET MORE NEWS.

620
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
A FEW DIFFERENT POINTS OF WHAT

621
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
THE PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY, AND I

622
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
NOTE THAT THE PRESIDENT GAVE US

623
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
MORE INFORMATION THAN WE
PREVIOUSLY HAD.

624
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
THE PRESIDENT NOTED THAT AS A

625
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
VICTIM, IT INCLUDED CHILDREN 5

626
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
TO 10 YEARS OLD.

627
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
IF YOU ARE JUST GYPPING, WE HAVE

628
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
BEEN REPORTING OVER THE LAST

629
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
SEVERAL HOURS WE HAVE HEARD OF

630
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
THE SHOOTING TAKING PLACE IN A

631
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
FEW DIFFERENT LOCATIONS

632
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
INCLUDING THE PRINCIPAL'S

633
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
OFFICE, THE ELEMENTARY

634
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
CLASSROOM, AND THE FIRST GRADE

635
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
FROM A PARENT.

636
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
THE PRESIDENT NARROWED THAT

637
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
DOWN, 5 TO 10 YEARS OLD.

638
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT HAPPENED

639
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
INSIDE THE SCHOOL?

640
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
WE DON'T KNOW.

641
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
WE DO KNOW THAT THIS IS THE

642
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
MURDER OF SOME OF OUR MOST

643
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
INNOCENT.
THAT IS THE BIG HEADLINE OF THE

644
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
DAY AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK

645
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
THROUGH THE OTHER DETAILS.

646
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
NOW IS CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST AND

647
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND A FORMER

648
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
NYPD INVESTIGATOR.

649
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
DOCTOR, FIRST THE MURDERER.

650
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
DEAD.

651
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
THAT ENRAGES US.

652
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
THERE IS ANGER AND SADNESS.

653
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE REMAIN

654
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
MOTIONS?
>>Guest: WE HAVE HEARD A LOT

655
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT ARE WE

656
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
BECOMING SENSITIZED TO MASS

657
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
SHOOTINGS?
WE HEAR ABOUT IT.

658
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
WE ARE UPSET FOR A DAY OR TWO

659
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
BUT THIS TAKES IT TO ANOTHER

660
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
LEVEL.
OUR MOST INNOCENT PEOPLE.

661
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
OUR YOUNGEST.

662
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
OUR MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF

663
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
SOCIETY.
WE SEE THEY ARE NOT SAFE.

664
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
THEY HAVE BEEN SLUTTERED --

665
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
SLAUGHTERED.

666
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
WILL WAKE US UP TO THE ISSUES OF

667
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
SOCIETY WHETHER IT IS MEDICAL

668
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
LAWS, LEGAL HAWS, GUN LAWS.

669
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I THINK IT IS MUCH TOO EARLY TO

670
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
GO INTO THOSE RIGHT NOW.

671
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON

672
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE

673
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
PARENTS, WITH THE CHILDREN, IN

674
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
THAT SCHOOL AND THAT COUNTRY,

675
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH US HERE

676
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
IN THE UNITED STATES.

677
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
THIS IS A GLOBAL ISSUE.

678
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
WE HAVE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO TALK

679
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
ABOUT THEIR GRIEF AND RAGE.

680
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
>> ONE QUESTION THAT COMES UP,

681
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN, AND WHAT

682
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
KIND OF PERSON DOES THIS?

683
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
>>Guest: IT IS A SICK AND

684
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
DERANGED INDIVIDUAL.

685
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
SOMETHING WAS GOING ON IN HIS

686
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
MIND THAT NOT ONLY TOOK THE

687
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
LIKES OF THOSE INNOCENT PEOPLE,

688
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
THE SCHOOLTEACHERS AS WELL AS

689
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
HIS OWN PARENTS IN TWO SEPARATE

690
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
STATES.

691
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
WHAT WE KNOW NOW THERE ARE TWO

692
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
SEPARATE CRIME SCENES, ONE IN

693
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
NEW JERSEY WHY HIS FATHER

694
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
APPEARS TO BE KILLED BY HIM.

695
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
AS WELL AS A CRIME SCENE, TWO

696
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
CRIME SCENES IN CONNECTICUT, ONE

697
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
AT THE SCHOOL AND ONE IN HIS

698
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
MOTHER'S HOME.

699
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
SO LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS A VERY

700
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
BIG TASK, PUTTING TOGETHER THE

701
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
DIFFERENT CRIME SCENES AND TIE

702
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
THE CASE TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND

703
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
WHY IT HAPPENED, WERE THERE

704
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
WARNING SIGNS, AND WHAT DO WE DO

705
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
MOVING FORWARD.

706
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
TO JEFF'S POINT, I WOULD SAY IT

707
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
IS TIME FOR US TO GO HIM AND HUG

708
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
OUR CHILDREN AND TO BE WITH OUR

709
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
CHILDREN AND TRY AND COUNSEL

710
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
THEM IN WHAT HAPPENED IN SOMEONE

711
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
ELSE'S SCHOOL BUS THEY WILL HEAR

712
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
ABOUT IT.

713
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
>> I AM GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT

714
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
UP.
WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK BUT

715
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
SO MANY PARENTS AND FAMILIES ARE

716
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
GOING TO SEE THIS, IT IS

717
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
UNAVOIDABLE, SO WE WILL LEARN TO

718
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
TALK TO OUR KIDS ABOUT IT.

719
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A BREAK?

720
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK.

721
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
>> WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM THE

722
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
GOVERNOR OF CUT -- CONNECTICUT

723
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
WHERE THE SCHOOL SHOOTING TOOK

724
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
PLACE THIS DAY, RIGHT BEFORE

725
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
HOLIDAY BREAK IN THE MIDDLE OF

726
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
HANUKAH RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

727
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM GOVERNOR

728
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
MALLOY IN A FEW MINUTES AND HOPE

729
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
TO HEAR MORE OF THE DETAILS.

730
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN KEEPING THE

731
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
DETAILS UNDER WRAPS.

732
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
THEY ARE TALKING TO THE FAMILIES

733
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
OF THOSE AFFECTED.

734
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
WELCOME BACK TO CONTINUING

735
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
COVERAGE OF THE WORST SCHOOL

736
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
SHOOTINGS IN OUR HISTORY.

737
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
26 PEOPLE PLUS THE SHOOTER ARE

738
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
DEAD.
20 OF THEM, THE VICTIMS, ARE

739
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
CHILDREN.
AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

740
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT; WHERE

741
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
THIS HAPPENED.

742
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
TEACHERS AND SCHOOL OFFICIALS

743
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
HELPED THE YOUNG STUDENTS

744
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
ESCAPE.

745
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
THE FIREHOUSE WAS DOWN THE BLOCK

746
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
AND THEY TOLD THEM TO CLOSE

747
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
THEIR EYES AS THEY LEFT THE

748
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
SCHOOL BUILDING.

749
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
MOMENTS AGO THE PRESIDENT

750
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
OFFERED HIS THOUGHTS FROM THE

751
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
WHITE HOUSE.

752
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
>> THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO

753
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
DIED TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

754
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

755
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
THE AGES OF FIVE AND TEN.

756
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

757
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
AHEAD OF THEM: BIRTHDAYS,

758
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
GRADUATIONS, WEDDINGS, KIDS OF

759
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
THEIR OWN.

760
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
>> THE MURDER OF THE CHILDREN

761
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
AND THE DEATH OF THEIR DREAMS.

762
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
>> SOME OF THE KIDS ARE BEING

763
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
LED OUT OF THE SCHOOL AND THE

764
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
GIRL IN THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN

765
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
IS CRYING BEYOND CONSOLABLE

766
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
GETTING LED OUT OF SCHOOL.

767
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
THE HOSPITAL IN NEIGHBORING

768
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
DANBURY CONNECTICUT IS TREATING

769
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
THREE PATIENT.

770
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
THE SCHOOL AND THE FACILITY WAS

771
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
ON LOCKDOWN.

772
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
WE SPOKE WITH THE MAYOR OF

773
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
DANBURY WHO SAID THE COMMUNITIES

774
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
HAD ACTIONS PLANS IN PLACE.

775
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
>> WHETHER IT WAS A SCHOOL

776
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
SHOOTER OR MASS CASUALTY WE

777
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
DRILL AND WE PRACTICE AND THE

778
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
KIDS PRACTICE.

779
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
THAT IS WHY WE NEED THESE THINGS

780
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
SO WE ARE READY.

781
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
>> WE SPOKE WITH AN 8-YEAR-OLD

782
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
WOULD CAME OUT OF SCHOOL 10

783
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
MINUTES AGO AND SAID SHE

784
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
REMEMBERS FIRE DRILLS AND WE

785
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
KNOW A DRILL IS ONE THING BUT A

786
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
MASS SHOOTING IS ANOTHER.

787
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
LITTLE CAN PREPARE YOU FOR THIS.

788
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
THE PARENTS HAVE BEEN STUNNED

789
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
SAYING THEY HAVE KNOWN NEWTOWN,

790
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
CONNECTICUT, AS ONE OF THE

791
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
SAFEST PLACES IN THE COUNTRY.

792
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
RICK?

793
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Rick: WE ARE SURROUNDED BY

794
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
DOZENS OF MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA.

795
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
THE GOVERNOR IS VERY CLOSE AND

796
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
IS EXPECTED TO APPROACH THE

797
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
PODIUM.
I WANT TO UPDATE OUR VIEWERS ON

798
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
INFORMATION FROM A RELIABLE

799
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE

800
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
WHO SAYS THE SHOOTER IN THIS

801
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
CASE MAY NOT BE RYAN LANZA BUT

802
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
HIS BROTHER.

803
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
RYAN LANZA IS IN CUSTODY IN NEW

804
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000

805
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
FACT, THE SHOOTER AND USED AN

806
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
ASSAULT RIFLE AND A GLOCK

807
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
HANDGUN AND MAY HAVE KILLED HIS

808
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
FATHER IN NEW JERSEY AND THEN

809
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
GONE DO HIS MOTHER'S HOME HERE

810
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
NEAR SANDY HOOK IN NEWTOWN,

811
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
CONNECTICUT, KILLED HIS MOTHER

812
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
AND WENT TO HER KINDERGARTEN AND

813
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
SLAUGHTERED EVERY CHILD IN THE

814
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
CLASSROOM.
THE DEATH TOLL IS 26 INCLUDING

815
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
20 CHILDREN AND FIVE ADULTS.

816
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
THE SHOOTER IS CONFIRMED DEAD

817
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
AND IS, IN FACT, ADAM LANZA AND

818
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
HIS BROTHER, RYAN, MAY BE IN

819
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
CUSTODY.
I AM TOLD THE TWO WEAPONS WERE

820
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
REGISTERED TO HIS MOTHER.

821
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
WE ARE EXPECTING AN UPDATE FROM

822
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
THE GOVERNOR.

823
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
WE WERE TOLD EARLIER THAT HIS

824
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
PRIMARY CONCERN IS THE FAMILY

825
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
MEMBERS OF THE VICTIMS AND THE

826
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
GOVERNOR'S PRESS PERSON IS

827
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
APPROACHING AS OUR THE STATE

828
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
POLICE.
>> THANK YOU.
WE WILL GO THERE LIKE TO THE LOT

829
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
OF THE SCENE ARE PARENTS AND AN

830
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
OFFICIAL AND WE DON'T KNOW THE

831
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
WOMAN ON LEFT.

832
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
MAYBE WE CAN BRING THAT PICTURE

833
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
BACK, SOMEONE WHO IS REACTING TO

834
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
THE SITUATION LOOKING BEYOND

835
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
CONSOLABLE AND WE CAN ONLY

836
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
IMAGINE AS WE LEARN 20 CHILDREN

837
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
DEAD, SEVERAL ADULTS, AND WE ARE

838
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
STILL WAITING ON CONSOLATION ON

839
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

840
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
RICK BROUGHT US NEWS THAT

841
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
PERHAPS THE NAME THAT WE HAVE

842
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
FOR THE INDIVIDUAL OF THE

843
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
SHOOTER IS WRONG AND WE WILL

844
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
WORK ON CONFIRMING THAT.

845
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
RICK IS ALWAYS RELIABLE AND THIS

846
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
HAS BEEN CHAOS.

847
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
THIS ONLY THE INITIAL REPORTS

848
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
POINTED TO TWO SHOOTERS.

849
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
WE ALSO HEARD THAT LOCAL

850
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
OFFICIALS WERE LOOKING FOR

851
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
ANOTHER CAR THAT HAD FLED THE

852
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
SCENE.

853
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
WE HAD LIVE SHOTS OF

854
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
INVESTIGATORS GOING INTO THE

855
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
WOODS BEHIND THE SCHOOLS.

856
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
THERE WERE MANY QUESTIONS ON

857
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
WHETHER THE INVESTIGATION WAS

858
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
OVER, WAS THE SCENE DONE, OR WAS

859
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
THERE SOMETHING GOING ON.

860
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS MUCH MORE TO

861
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
THE INVESTIGATION.
THE BODY OF THE SHOOTER IS

862
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
INSIDE THE BILL AND WE WILL WORK

863
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
ON CONFIRMING THE IDENTITY.

864
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
ONE OF THE THING WE ARE ALSO

865
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
WATCHING IS THE FACT THAT

866
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
WHOEVER THE SHOOTER IS, THE

867
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
BROTHER, TRY AS WE MAY, RYAN OR

868
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
ADAM -- HERE IS THE GOVERNOR.

869
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
>> TRAGEDY PLAYED ITSELF OUT IN

870
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
THIS COMMUNITY.

871
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
THE LT. GOVERNOR AND I HAVE BEEN

872
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
SPOKEN TO IN AN ATTEMPT TO BE

873
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
PREPARED FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS

874
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
PLAYING ITSELF OUT.

875
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
WE CAN NEVER BE PREPARED IF THIS

876
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
KIND OF INCIDENT.

877
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
WHAT HAS HAPPENED, WHAT HAS

878
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
TRANSPIRED AT THE SCHOOL

879
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
BUILDING WILL LEAVE A MARK ON

880
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
THIS COMMUNITY AND EVERY FAMILY

881
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
IMPACTED.

882
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I AND ONLY THAT ALL OF OUR

883
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
RESPONSIBILITY IT WAS TO EDUCATE

901
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
AND SUPERVISE THOSE CHILDREN.

902
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
THE PERPETRATOR OF THE CRIME IS

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
DEAD AS IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO THE

904
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000

905
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000

949
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
SHORTLY AFTER 9:30 THIS MORNING,

950
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000

ELEMENTARY COOL IN NEWTOWN.

953
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
UPON REALIZING THE INTENSITY AND

954
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
DIFFICULTY OF THE SITUATION WE

955
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000

964
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
REMOVE THEM TO A SAFE AREA

965
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL.

966
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
THEY DID SEARCH EVERY NOOK AND

967
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
CRANNY EVERY ROOM, AND EVERY

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000

00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
FATALITIES.

974
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
THERE WERE 18 CHILDREN

975
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000

976
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000

IT IS NOT A SIMPLISTIC SCENE.

998
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
WE NEED TO ESTABLISH IDENTITY.

999
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000

WE HAVE NOT MADE ANY POSITIVE

1137
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000

1176
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
POLICE ENGAGE WITH THE SHOOTER

1177
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
AND WE LEARNED ACCORDING TO LT.

1178
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
COLONEL, POLICE DID NOT SHOOT

1179
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000

1180
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
THE SHOOTER IS DEAD.

1181
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000

MY NEPHEW WAS IN A CLASSROOM

1200
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
