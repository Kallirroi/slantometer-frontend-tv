HAD NOT SPOKEN OR SEEN EACH

189
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
OTHER IN A COUPLE OF YEARS.

190
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
LAST SAW HIS BROTHER IN 2010.

191
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH GOOD

192
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
INFORMATION IS HE GOING TO GET

193
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
ABOUT THE SHOOTER FROM THE

194
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
BROTHER WHO LIVES IN HOBOKEN.

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
>> DIVORCED OFFICIALLY IN

196
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
2009.
SEPARATED IN 2008.

197
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
THE PARENTS WHERE THE MOM IS

198
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
LIVING IN NEWTOWN AND THE DAD

199
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
IS LIVING IN NEW JERSEY.

200
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
>> AND OF COURSE HE KILLED HIS

201
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
MOTHER BEFORE TAKING HER CAR

202
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
AND THEN DRIVING TO THE

203
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
SCHOOL.
WE HAVE MORE ON THAT

204
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
CHRONOLOGY AS WELL.
>> AND THEN LEAVING WITH HER

205
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
GUNS WHICH WERE ALL OBTAINED

206
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
LEGALLY.

207
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
THEY HAD PERMITS.

208
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
>> MOMENTS AGO THE FBI JUST

209
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
CLEARED THE SUSPECT'S FAMILY

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
AS WE JUST MENTIONED INCLUDING

211
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
HIS FATHER AND OLDER BROTHER

212
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
RYAN WHO WAS INITIALLY

213
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
MISTAKEN AS HIS BROTHER ADAM

214
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
THE GUNMAN BRIEFLY CUFFED.

215
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
ANNA KOOIMAN JOINS US NOW FROM

216
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY.

217
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
ANNA, WHAT DO WE NO KNOW ABOUT

218
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
THE LANZA FAMILY.

219
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
>> WE CAN TELL YOU QUITE A BIT

220
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
OF INFORMATION, BRIAN, GOOD

221
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
MORNING TO YOU AND GOOD

222
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
MORNING TO EVERYBODY AT HOME.

223
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
WE ARE STANDING IN FRONT OF

224
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
THE BUILDING THAT IS

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
APPARENTLY THE HOME OF THE

226
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
SHOOTER'S BROTHER 24-YEAR-OLD

227
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
RYAN LANZA, HE LIVED HERE WITH

228
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
TWO OTHER PEOPLE.

229
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
WE WERE HERE YESTERDAY AND

230
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
LAST NIGHT AND WATCHED AS COPS

231
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
ROLLED UP THE TAPE THAT HAD

232
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
BEEN INCIRCLING THE BUILDING

233
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
ABOUT 10:00 LAST NIGHT.

234
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
YES IT MAY BE QUIET NOW BUT A

235
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SCENE

236
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
YESTERDAY.
ALL SORTS OF CONFUSION AND

237
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
CHAOS AND SOME OF THAT

238
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
STEMMING FROM REPORTS THAT

239
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
THERE WAS SOMEONE MURDERED

240
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
INSIDE THIS APARTMENT BUILDING

241
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
AND IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLY THE

242
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
FATHER OF THE BROTHERS PETER

243
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
LANZA.
WE DO HAVE A RELIABLE SOURCE

244
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
AND THE FBI TELLING US NO,

245
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
THAT IS NOT THE CASE AND THAT

246
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
THE FATHER WAS QUESTIONED BY

247
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
FBI AGENTS LAST NIGHT.

248
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
THAT SOURCE ALSO TELLING US

249
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
THAT RYAN YESTERDAY AFTERNOON

250
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
DID NOT KNOW ABOUT EVERYTHING

251
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
COMING HERE, SEEING HIS

252
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
APARTMENT INCIRCLED BY POLICE.

253
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
HE WAS THEN HANDCUFFED AND

254
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
TAKEN AWAY.

255
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
THE REASON FOR SOME OF THIS

256
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
CONFUSION MAY HAVE STEMMED

257
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
BECAUSE THE SHOOTER ADAM LANZA

258
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
WAS CARRYING RYAN LANZA'S I.D.

259
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
AND, OF COURSE, RESIDENTS HERE

260
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
IN HOBOKEN ARE REALLY ON EDGE,

261
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
ESPECIALLY YESTERDAY, THINKING

262
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
THAT A MASS MURDERER MAY HAVE

263
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
BEEN LIVING AMONG THEM.

264
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
>> IT WAS OBVIOUSLY SCARY TO

265
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
SEE THAT SOMEONE THAT COULD

266
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
COMMIT SOME ACT LIKE THIS IS

267
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
LIVING AMONGST YOU.

268
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
YOU ARE WALKING PROBABLY IN

269
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD.

270
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I DON'T KNOW THE PINNER --

271
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
PERSON PERSONALLY.

272
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
OBVIOUSLY PROBABLY CROSSED

273
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
PATHS FROM TIME TO TIME AND
THAT'S AWFUL.

274
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
>> WELL, THE FBI SAYS THAT THE

275
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
BROTHER AND THE FATHER HAVE

276
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
BEEN CLEARED AND POSSIBLY MAY

277
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
BE ON THEIR WAY BACK TO

278
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
CONNECTICUT.
THAT'S WHERE PETER LANZA

279
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
LIVED.
HE DID GET REMARRIED AND LIVES

280
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
WITH HIS WIFE THERE.

281
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
THEY IN STANFORD.

282
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
ALTHOUGH NOT BEING A SUSPECT,

283
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
RYAN'S COMPUTER AND PHONE

284
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
RECORDS ARE BEING SEARCHED.

285
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
THAT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE

286
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
APARTMENT YESTERDAY.

287
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
AND RYAN AS MENTIONED HAS BEEN

288
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
COOPERATING WITH POLICE GUYS,

289
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
AND HAS MENTIONED THAT HIS

290
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
BROTHER ADAM POSSIBLY DID HAVE

291
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
A PERSONALITY DISORDER AND

292
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
MILD AUTISM.

293
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
BACK TO YOU.

294
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
>> Shepard: ALL RIGHT, ANNA,

295
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NOT TOO LONG AGO THE PRINCIPAL

296
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
AT SANDY HOOK SCHOOL SENT OUT

297
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
A LETTER TO THE PARENTS OF THE

298
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
SCHOOL AND SAID WE'RE

299
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
INSTALLING A NEW SECURITY

300
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
SYSTEM.
GOING FORWARD WHAT THEY ARE

301
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
GOING TO DO IS THEY WOULD HAVE

302
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
TO BUZZ A DOORBELL AT THE

303
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
FRONT OF THE ONLY OPEN -- THE

304
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
ONLY ACCESS POINT IN THE

305
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
SCHOOL THE FRONT DOOR.

306
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
ALL THE OTHER DOORS ARE GOING

307
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
TO BE LOCKED.

308
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
ACCORDING TO A REPORT IN THE

309
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
"NEW YORK TIMES" THIS MORNING,

310
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
APPARENTLY THIS SHOOTER ADAM

311
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
LANZA WENT UP TO THE DOOR,

312
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
RANG THE BUZZER AND THE

313
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
PRINCIPAL REALIZED OH, THAT'S

314
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
NANCY LANZA'S SON.

315
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I RECOGNIZE HIM.

316
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'M GOING TO LET HIM IN.

317
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
AND IT WAS JUST A COUPLE

318
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
MINUTES LATER THAT SHE

319
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
ACTUALLY CONFRONTED HIM IN THE
HALL AND HE SHOT HER DEAD.

320
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
>> HERE IS WHY THERE IS A

321
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
LITTLE BIT OF PROBLEM WITH

322
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
THAT STORY IN THAT SUPPOSEDLY

323
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
SHE WAS IN A CONFERENCE WITH

324
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST AND

325
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
WITH ANOTHER PARENT.

326
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
SO AT THAT TIME IS THE

327
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
PRINCIPAL REALLY THE ONE WHO

328
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
HAS TO IN THE MIDDLE OF A

329
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
CONFERENCE MEETING HIT A

330
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
BUTTON AND CUE SOMEBODY IN.

331
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
AND NANCY WE UNDERSTAND THE

332
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
MOM LATEST REPORTS WAS SHE

333
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
WASN'T WORKING THERE.

334
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
SAW A REPORT IN THE DAILY NEWS

335
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
TODAY THAT SHE HAD STOPPED

336
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
WORKING IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH

337
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
ADAM FULL TIME.

338
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
>> THAT WAS JUST A PICTURE OF

339
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
THE PRINCIPAL.

340
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I THINK WHAT THEY DO IS THEY

341
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
HAVE A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA

342
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
WITH A LITTLE TV SCREEN.

343
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
>> OFFICE BUZZES THEM IN.

344
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
IF THEY LOOK RELATIVELY NORMAL

345
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
AND OF COURSE HE WASN'T

346
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
WEARING I'M SURE THE SKI MASK

347
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
OR WHATEVER IT WAS AT THAT

348
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
TIME.

349
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE STORIES

350
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
OF SOME HEROISM AND PROFOUND

351
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
CARRYING THAT THE TEACHERS

352
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
TOOK OVER INSIDE THE SCHOOL

353
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
WHEN THE GUNFIRE BROKE OUT.

354
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
THERE IS A STORY OF A FIRST

355
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
GRADE TEACHER HER NAME IS

356
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
KATELYN ROIG.

357
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
HAD 14 KIDS IN HER CLASS.

358
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
MORNING MEETING.
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

359
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
KIDS YOU SIT AROUND IN THE

360
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
MORNING AND TALK ABOUT WHAT

361
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
YOUR DAY IS GOING TO BE LIKE.

362
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
DURING MORNING MEETING THEY

363
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
HEARD GUNSHOTS.

364
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
THE TEACHER DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

365
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
WAS HAPPENING SHE KNEW

366
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
SOMETHING BAD WAS HAPPENING.

367
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
SHE BARRICADED HER DOOR WITH

368
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
WHATEVER SORT OF ROLLING CART

369
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
IS AVAILABLE.

370
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
THERE IS A BATHROOM IN THE 3RD

371
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
GRADE CLASSROOM.

372
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
SHE TOOK HER 14 KIDS INTO THE

373
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
BATHROOM AND LOCKED THE

374
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
BATHROOM DOOR.

375
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
SOME OF THE KIDS HAD TO GET UP

376
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
ON THE TOILET AND SHE JUST

377
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
TOLD THEM YOU NEED TO BE

378
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
EXTREMELY QUIET IN HERE,

379
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING.

380
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
LET'S LISTEN TO HER.

381
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
>> I PUT ONE OF MY STUDENTS ON

382
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
TOP OF THE TOILET.

383
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I JUST KNEW WE HAD TO GET IN

384
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
THERE I WAS TELLING THEM IT'S

385
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
GOING TO BE OKAY.

386
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
YOU ARE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

387
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I HAD PULLED THE BOOK SHELF

388
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
BEFORE I CLOSED THE DOOR IN

389
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
FRONT OF IT SO WE WERE

390
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
COMPLETELY BARRICADED IN.

391
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I TURNED THE LIGHTS OFF.

392
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
>> DID YOU TELL THEM TO BE

393
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
QUIET.
>> YEAH.

394
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
>> DID YOU WORRY ABOUT THEM.
>> I TOLD THEM TO BE QUIET.

395
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I TOLD THEM WE HAD TO BE

396
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
ABSOLUTELY QUIET BECAUSE I WAS

397
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
JUST SO AFRAID IF HE DID COME

398
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
IN AND HEAR US AND MAYBE JUST

399
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
START SHOOTING THE DOOR.

400
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I SAID WE HAVE TO BE

401
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
ABSOLUTELY QUIET.

402
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
AND WE I SAID THERE IS A BAD

403
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
GUY OUT THERE NOW WE NEED TO

404
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
WAIT FOR THE GOOD GUY.

405
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
[CRYING]

406
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I WANTED US TO BE OKAY.

407
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'M SO SADDENED THAT THERE ARE

408
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
PEOPLE WHO IN THIS SITUATION

409
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
ARE NOT OKAY.

410
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO

411
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
ANYONE WHO KNEW THEM AND WAS

412
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
PART OF THEIR LIVES.

413
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

414
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
>> Steve: YOU CAN'T IMAGINE.

415
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
THERE ARE ALSO STORIES OF

416
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
HEROISM A SCHOOL JANITOR

417
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

418
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
RAN UP AND DOWN THE HALLS

419
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
TELLING PEOPLE LOCK YOUR

420
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
DOORS.

421
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
FROM THE INSIDE.

422
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
>> IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW

423
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
THIS COULD BE WORSE BUT

424
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
APPARENTLY IT COULD BE WORSE

425
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
IF THESE TEACHERS HADN'T TAKEN

426
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
ACTION.
YOU NEVER KNOW HOW YOU ARE

427
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
GOING IT RESPOND IN ONE OF

428
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
THESE LIFE ALTERING

429
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
SITUATIONS.
>> WITH IT CLASSROOMS, THREE

430
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
MINUTES, UNBELIEVABLE THE
AMOUNT OF DAMAGE AND TRAUMA HE

431
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
HAS CAUSED.

432
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE FOR THE

433
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
NEXT FOUR HOURS AND OF COURSE

434
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
HAVE CONTINUING COVERAGE

435
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
THROUGH THE DAY.

436
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
STRAIGHT AHEAD YOUR CHILD

437
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
DIDN'T NEED TO BE AT THE SCENE

438
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
OF THE SHOOTING TO BE

439
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
TRAUMATIZED.
JUST HEARING ABOUT IT CAN BE

440
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
TRAUMATIC.
AS A PARENT WHAT DO YOU DO AND

441
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
ADVISE?

442
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
DR. MARK STEALING HERE LIVE

443
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
NEXT.
This holiday, Share Everything.

444
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Share "Not even close."

445
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Share "You owe me..."

446
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Share "Just right."

447
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The Share Everything Plan.

448
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Shareable data across 10 devices

449
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
with uimited
talk and text.

450
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
by HTC for $49.99.

451
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Music is a universal language.

452
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But when I was in an accident...

453
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I was worried the
health care system

454
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
spoke a language all its own

455
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
With UnitedHealthcare,
I got help that fit my life.

456
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Information on my phone.

457
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Connection to doctors who
get where I'm from.

458
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And tools to estimate what
my care may cost.

459
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So I never missed a beat.

460
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
We're more than 78,000
people looking out for

461
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
more than 70
million Americans.

462
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's health in numbers.
UnitedHealthcare.

463
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
POLICE SAID COME AND LINE UP

464
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
AND CLOSE YOUR EYES AND HOLD

465
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
ON TO EACH OTHER.
THEY SAID THERE COULD BE SOME

466
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
BAD STUFF.
WE CLOSED OUR EYES AND WE WENT

467
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
OUT.
WHEN WE GOT OUT, THEY SAID

468
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
OPEN YOUR EYES AND WE FOUND

469
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
GLASS AND BLOOD ON THE GROUND.

470
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
>> HEART BREAKING.

471
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
THAT CHILD REACTING TO THE

472
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
TERRIFYING ORDEAL AT HIS

473
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL YESTERDAY.

474
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
20 CHILDREN WERE AMONG THOSE

475
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
KILLED IN THIS MASSACRE.

476
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
WHAT TYPE OF IMPACT WILL THIS

477
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
HAVE ON THE SURVIVORS OF THE

478
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
TRAGEDY AND HOW CAN WE HELP

479
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
ALL CHILDREN COPE WITH THIS

480
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
VIOLENCE AND ADULTS BY THE

481
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
WAY.

482
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
DR. MARC SIEGEL IS AN

483
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000

FALSE ALARM THE TRUTH WILL THE

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
EPIDEMIC OF FEAR.

488
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
DOCTOR, GREAT TO HAVE YOU.
>> GOOD MORNING, ALISYN.

489
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
>> Alisyn: LET'S START WITH

490
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
THE KIDS WHO WERE AT THE

491
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
SCHOOL.
THIS WILL HAVE A LIFELONG

492
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
IMPACT ON THEM.

493
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
>> THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT

494
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
THAT THAT CHILD WE JUST SHOWED

495
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
HAD TREMENDOUS COURAGE THE WAY

496
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
THAT HE WAS ABLE TO WALK OUT

497
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
OF THERE AND DID WHAT HE WAS

498
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
TOLD TO DO AND HIS PATIENTS

499
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
SHOULD BE SO PROUD OF HIM.

500
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT 77% OF

501
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
THE KIDS THAT WERE IN THAT

502
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
SCHOOL ARE GOING TO HAVE

503
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER

504
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
AND 35% OF THE KIDS AND JUST

505
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, LIVING IN

506
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

507
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
>> Alisyn: MEANING THOSE

508
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
STATISTICS BASED UPON PREVIOUS

509
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
TRAGEDIES, GENERALLY YOU CAN

510
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
FIGURE OUT HOW MANY WILL HAVE

511
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
ACUTE SYMPTOMS AFTER THAT.

512
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

513
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
THAT'S THESE STATISTICS PUT

514
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
TOGETHER BY THE VETERANS

515
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
ADMINISTRATION.

516
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS.

517
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
IT'S GOING TO INTERFERE WITH

518
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
THEIR PLAY.

519
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
IT MEANS THEY ARE GOING TO PUT

520
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
THE EVENTS TOGETHER BACKWARDS.

521
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY ARE GOING

522
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
TO THINK THAT MAYBE SOMETHING

523
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
HAPPENED IN ADVANCE THAT MIGHT

524
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
HAVE CAUSED THIS TO HAPPEN.

525
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
THIS IS HOW THINGS KID.

526
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
AGGRESSIVE AT PLAY, SAD AT

527
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
PLAY.
THEY MAY HAVE TROUBLE

528
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
SLEEPING.

529
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
THEY MAY HAVE TROUBLE WITH

530
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
DEPRESSION.
THIS CAN GO ON FOR MONTHS.

531
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
LUCKILY, ALISYN, THERAPY WORKS

532
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
ON THIS.

533
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
BEHAVIORAL THERAPY WORKS WHICH

534
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
TARGETS THE TRAUMA AND HELPS

535
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
KIDS WORK THROUGH IT.

536
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
IT IS EFFECTIVE.

537
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT

538
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO

539
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
ARE WATCHING THIS.

540
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
>> Alisyn: LET'S TALK ABOUT

541
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
THAT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THE LET

542
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
DIRECT KIND OF TRAUMA BUT IT'S

543
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
TRAUMA NONE THE LESS.

544
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I HAVE FRIENDS FROM ALL OVER

545
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
THE COUNTRY CALLING KNOWING

546
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
THAT WE LIVE IN THIS GENERAL

547
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
AREA AND THEY'RE DEVASTATED.

548
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
PEOPLE CAN'T PULL THEMSELVES

549
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
AWAY FROM THE TV.

550
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
THEY CAN'T STOP CRYING.

551
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
THERE IS TRAUMA EVERYWHERE

552
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
TODAY.
>> I HAVE TWO POINTS ABOUT

553
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
THIS ALISYN.

554
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
FIRST OF ALL PEOPLE HAVE TO

555
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
RETURN TO THEIR REGULAR LIVES.

556
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
THEY CAN'T OBSESS EVEN ON OUR

557
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
REPORTS.
THEY CAN'T TEACH THEIR KIDS TO

558
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
WORRY.
I THINK WE HAVE TO ROLE MODEL

559
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
OUR KIDS TO BE COMMON.

560
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
TEACH OUR KIDS EMPATHY FOR THE

561
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED.

562
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
EMPATHY FOR THE VICTIMS.

563
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
LET'S CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

564
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
TO THE PEOPLE THERE AND NOT

565
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
TALK ABOUT OUR OWN SCHOOLS,

566
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
WHICH STATISTICALLY REMAIN

567
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
ENORMOUSLY SAFE.
WE'RE REPORTING TOO MUCH ON

568
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
SHOULD RERAMP UP SECURITY IN

569
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY?

570
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
THESE TRAGEDIES ARE VERY RARE.

571
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW COURAGE

572
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
USES THE SAME CENTERS OF THE

573
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
BRAIN THAT FEAR DOES.

574
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
LET'S REPLACE OUR FEAR TODAY

575
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
WITH COURAGE AND CARING.

576
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
>> Alisyn: HOW DO YOU TEACH

577
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
YOUR KIDS EMPATHY.

578
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
>> YOU SHOW IT YOURSELVES.

579
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
IF YOU ARE OUT THERE CARING

580
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN

581
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
SCHOOLS RATHER THAN WORRYING

582
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
ABOUT YOUR OWN LIFE KIDS PICK

583
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
UP ON THAT.
IF THEY SEE YOU AS CALM.

584
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
WE HAVE TO ALL BE ROLE MODELS

585
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
FOR OUR CHILDREN.

586
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
SO TODAY TURN OFF THE

587
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
TELEVISION IF YOUR CHILDREN

588
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
ARE AROUND.
WE NEVER GIVE THAT

589
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
RECOMMENDATION.
IF KIDS ARE AROUND.

590
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
PUT THE NEWSPAPERS ASIDE.

591
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
PUT THE RADIO OFF.

592
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
YOU PUT THE TV OFF AND YOU

593
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
JUST TRY TO BE AS

594
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
COMPASSIONATE WITH THEM AS

595
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
POSSIBLE.
>> ALISYN, ANSWER THEIR

596
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
QUESTIONS.
THEY ARE GOING TO ASK YOU

597
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
ABOUT THIS TODAY.

598
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
ANSWER THEM.

599
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
DON'T TRY TO SHY AWAY FROM IT.

600
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
BUT, DON'T IMMERSE THEM IN IT

601
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
AND DON'T MAKE THEM THINK IT'S

602
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM.

603
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO

604
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
THEM.

605
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
>> Alisyn: DR. SEGAL GREAT TO

606
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
HAVE YOU HERE.
>> THANK YOU, ALISYN.

607
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
>> IS THERE ANYTHING CAN YOU

608
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
DO TO PREPARE YOUR CHILD FOR

609
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
ARE THERE SURVIVAL SKILLS WE

610
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
SHOULD BE TEACHING THEM

611
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
SOMEHOW AND WHAT AGE?

612
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
WE EXPLORE ALL THAT NEXT.

613
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You ever notice that some people
just have a knack

614
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
for giving the perfect gift?

615
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
They put real thought into it.

616
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And find just...

617
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
the right...thing.

618
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
How do they do that?

619
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
More saving. More doing.

620
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That's the power of The
Home Depot.

621
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Pick up a RIDGID JobMax
multi-tool starter kit and
get a free head attachment.

622
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
[ Male Announcer ]
JILL AND HER MOUTH HAVE LIVED

623
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
A GREAT LIFE.

624
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
BUT SHE HAS SOME DENTAL ISSUES
SHE'S NOT HAPPY ABOUT.

625
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
SO I INTRODUCED JILL

626
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
TO CREST PRO-HEALTH FOR LIFE.

627
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
SELECTED FOR PEOPLE OVER 50.

628
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
PRO-HEALTH FOR LIFE IS A
TOOTHPASTE THAT DEFENDS AGAINST

629
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
TENDER, INFLAMED GUMS,
SENSITIVITY AND WEAK ENAMEL.

630
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
CONDITIONS PEOPLE OVER 50
EXPERIENCE.

631
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
CREST PRO-HEALTH FOR LIFE.

632
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
SO JILL CAN KEEP LIVING
THE GOOD LIFE.

633
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
CREST.
LIFE OPENS UP WHEN YOU DO.

634
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
SANDY HOOK IT UPDATED

635
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
REQUIRING VISITS TO RING A

636
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
BELL.

637
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
SOMEBODY WOULD RING THEM.
IN STILL THE UNTHINKABLE

638
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

639
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
WHAT SHOULD SCHOOLS BE DOING

640
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
RIGHT NOW TO PREPARE AND

641
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
PROTECT THEIR STUDENTS?

642
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
A FORMER DETECTIVE FOR THE NEW

643
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT

644
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
AND HE IS A SECURITY EXPERT AS

645
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
WELL.
HARRY, THANKS FOR COMING IN ON

646
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
THIS SATURDAY MORNING.

647
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
>> GOOD MORNING.

648
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
>> Steve: TERRIBLE STORY.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

649
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
REACTION PLAN WAS AT THE

650
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
SCHOOL WE DO KNOW THEY HAD

651
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
RECENTLY IN-STORED A NEW

652
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
DOORBELL.
>> A DOORBELL IS NICE BUT IN A

653
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS YOU

654
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
BASICALLY NEED WHAT'S CALLED

655
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
THE EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN.

656
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
THIS IS A SPECIAL PLAN THAT

657
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
YOU SET UP IN THE EVENT AN

658
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
ATTACK LIKE THIS OCCURS.

659
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
THIS WAY YOUR PEOPLE KNOW HOW

660
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
TO REACT.

661
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
YOU KNOW, I SAW A LOT OF

662
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
PEOPLE ON TV YESTERDAY,

663
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
ESPECIALLY THE TEACHERS, OKAY,

664
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW

665
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
THEY REACTED MUCH WHEN

666
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
SOMETHING HAPPENS.
IT'S JUST LIKE A FIRE DRILL.

667
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
YOU KNOW, PUTTING AN EMERGENCY

668
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
ACTION PLAN TOGETHER IS KEY

669
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
THEY NEED TO KNOW HOW TO REACT

670
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS

671
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
OCCURS.
ALL RIGHT?

672
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
SO THE TEACHERS NEED TO BE

673
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
TRAINED, ALL RIGHT.

674
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
THE REST OF THE SCHOOL STAFF

675
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
NEEDS TO BE TRAINED.

676
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
>> Steve: SURE.

677
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
>> ALL RIGHT.
AND YOU HAVE GOT TO WORK IN

678
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
CONJUNCTION WITH THE POLICE

679
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
DEPARTMENT ON HOW TO REACT TO

680
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

681
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
>> Steve: IT DOES SOUND LIKE

682
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
THEY HAD THE RIGHT IDEA.

683
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
THE JANITOR APPARENTLY

684
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
SELFLESSLY RAN UP AND DOWN THE

685
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
HALLS TELLING THE TEACHERS TO

686
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
LOCK THE DOORS FROM THE INSIDE

687
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
AND APPARENTLY SOMEBODY KEYED

688
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
THE INTERCOM, THE PUBLIC

689
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
ADDRESS SYSTEM.

690
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

691
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
>> Steve: FROM THE OFFICE SO
THAT PEOPLE COULD HEAR THE

692
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
SCREAMS AND SHOOTING AS WELL

693
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
AND PERHAPS THAT ACTUALLY

694
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
SAVED SOME LIVES.
>> IT PROBABLY DEFINITELY DID.

695
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
THE FIRST TWO MINUTES ARE THE

696
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
MOST IMPORTANT TIME IN AN

697
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
ACTIVE SHOOTER ATTACK.

698
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
THAT'S WHEN MOST OF THE DAMAGE

699
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
OCCURRED.

700
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I WAS LISTENING TO SOME OF THE
RADIO TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE

701
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
POLICE DEPARTMENT YESTERDAY IT

702
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
SEEMS LIKE BY THE TIME THE

703
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
POLICE OFFICERS ALREADY

704
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
ARRIVED THAT THE SHOOTER HAD

705
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
ALREADY KILLED HIMSELF.

706
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
IF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

707
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
>> Steve: DO YOU THINK SCHOOLS

708
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
SHOULD HAVE ARMED GUARDS.

709
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
>> YES, WITHOUT A DOUBT.

710
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THEM HERE IN

711
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
NEW YORK.

712
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE NOTHING

713
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
FOR ONE POLICE OFFICER TO BE

714
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
AROUND THE SCHOOL AREA BETWEEN

715
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
9:00 AND 3:30 IN THE

716
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
AFTERNOON.
>> Steve: JUST A LOCAL POLICE

717
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
OFFICER.
>> THAT WOULD BE PART OF HIS

718
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
DUTY.

719
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
>> EXACTLY NOT TO STAND IN

720
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
FRONT OF THE SCHOOL.

721
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
IDEALLY, YOU WOULD WANT A

722
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
SECURITY PERSON WHO WAS IN

723
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
PLAIN CLOTHES BECAUSE EVEN IF

724
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
YOU HAD SOMEBODY ARMED IN A

725
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
UNIFORM, THE ACTIVE SHOOTER

726
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
WOULD PROBABLY KNOW WHO HE IS

727
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
JUST BY AND THEN JUST SHOOT

728
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
HIM FIRST.

729
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
>> Steve: HARRY, IT'S A SAD

730
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
SITUATION TO THINK THAT WE

731
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
WOULD HAVE TO HAVE ARMED

732
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
GUARDS AT OUR SCHOOLS.

733
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
IN THIS PARTICULAR TOWN I HAVE

734
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
BEEN UP IN THAT AREA IT'S

735
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
IDEAL LICK, BEAUTIFUL.

736
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
LAST PLACE YOU WOULD THINK

737
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD

738
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
HAPPEN.
>> EXACTLY.

739
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
WE LIVE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
INTERCOM.

923
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
THAT MAY HAVE ACTUALLY SAVED

924
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
SOME LIVES.

925
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
IMMEDIATELY TEACHERS HEARD

926
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
THAT THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS

927
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
WRONG AND STARTED LOCKING

928
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
DOORS.

929
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
>> THINK ABOUT THAT, TOO.

930
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
IT'S WORTH -- IT'S WORTH THE

931
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
DAMAGE DONE BUT THEN YOU GET

932
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
TO HEAR THE HORROR AS IT

933
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
UNFOLDS ON ALL THE SPEAKERS IN

934
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
THE CLASSROOMS.

935
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
YOU REACT TO IT BUT YOU STILL

936
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
TAKE IT IN.

937
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
>> IT ALLOWED THEM TO

938
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
BARRICADE THEMSELVES IN THE

939
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
ROOM WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY

940
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
HELPFUL.
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE

941
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
PRINCIPAL.

942
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
A I DON'T MEAN 27 YEARS OLD.

943
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
DAWN HOCKSPRUNG I HOPE I'M

944
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
SAYING THAT RIGHT.

945
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
DESCRIBED AS INCREDIBLY

946
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
DEDICATED AND PASSIONATE

947
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
EDUCATOR.

948
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
SHE HAD A TWITTER STREAM.

949
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
SHE WOULD APPARENTLY SEND OUT

950
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
MESSAGES ALL THE TIME ABOUT

951
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
THE THINGS THAT SHE WAS

952
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
EXCITED ABOUT AT SCHOOL, THE

953
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
WAY SHE WAS EXCITED TO WELCOME

954
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
NEW KINDERGARTNERS THIS YEAR

955
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
INTO THE CLASS.
I THINK THE QUOTE WAS I'M SO

956
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
EXCITED THAT THEY HAVE A

957
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
LIFETIME OF LEARNING AHEAD OF

958
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
THEM.

959
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
SHE IS -- ONE OF THE THINGS

960
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
THAT SHE IS NOTED FOR TODAY IS

961
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
THAT SHE INSTALLED THIS NEW

962
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
SECURITY SYSTEM.

963
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
AND THE WAY IT WORKS.

964
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
THE WAY IT WORKS IN MOST

965
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS THAT THERE

966
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
IS A CAMERA AT THE FRONT DOOR.

967
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
THE DOOR IS LOCKED.

968
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
YOU HAVE TO BUZZ EVEN AS A

969
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
PARENT YOU BUZZ AND THEN

970
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
SOMEBODY GIVES LIKE A VISUAL

971
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
IDENTIFICATION IN THE ROOM AND

972
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
BUZZ -- IN THE OFFICE AND

973
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
BUZZES YOU IN.

974
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
OF COURSE, WHEN PEOPLE ARE

975
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
BUSY, AND YOU ARE NOT

976
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
EXPECTING A MASS MURDERER,

977
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
PEOPLE PROBABLY, ABSENT

978
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
MINDEDLY BUZZ PEOPLE IN ALL

979
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
THE TIME.

980
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
SITUATION WAS YESTERDAY.

981
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
OBVIOUSLY WE CAN ASSUME THE

982
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
GUNMAN WASN'T WEARING COMBAT

983
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
CAMO HEAD GEAR WHEN HE BUZZED.

984
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
BUT THIS JUST HAPPENS ALL THE

985
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
TIME THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU THINK

986
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
IT'S A PARENT AND ALSO WE HAD

987
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
HEARD THAT THE PRINCIPAL

988
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
RECOGNIZED HIM, ADAM LANZA

989
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
SOMEHOW BECAUSE PERHAPS HIS

990
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
MOTHER WAS CONNECTED TO THE

991
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
SCHOOL.

992
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
>> "NEW YORK TIMES."

993
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I GIVE SO MUCH CREDIT TO THE

994
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
PRINCIPAL WHEN YOU HEAR GUN

995
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
SHOTS A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD

996
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
SAY DUCK AND COVER.

997
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
SHE AND THE PSYCHIATRIST,

998
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
SCHOOL PSYCHIATRIST WHO WAS

999
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
GOING TO ACCORDING TO ONE

1000
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
REPORT RETIRE AT THE END OF

1001
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
THIS YEAR WALK OUT TOWARDS THE

1002
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
GUNSHOTS AND THEN SHE WAS

1003
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
KILLED.
WHAT KIND OF PERSON WAS SHE?

1004
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
WE MENTIONED ABOUT THE TWEETS.

1005
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
SHE WOULD BE SOMEBODY THAT

1006
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
WOULD BE SILLY.

1007
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I REMEMBER PRINCIPALS FAR

1008
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
REMOVED FROM KIDS.

1009
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
OH MY GOODNESS.

1010
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
>> SCARY.

1011
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
>> SHE WOULD DRESS IN SILLY

1012
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
OUTFITS ON WEDNESDAYS.

1013
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
WACKY WEDNESDAYS WHERE THEY

1014
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
ENCOURAGED KIDS TO DRESS IN A

1015
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
FUNNY, CRAZY WAY.

1016
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
SO SHE WAS SOMEBODY THAT

1017
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
PEOPLE COULD REALLY RELATE TO

1018
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
THAT WAS REALLY PUMPED UP TO

1019
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
DO HER JOB ON A DAILY BASIS.

1020
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
A THE LOVE THE KIDS WERE

1021
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
EVIDENTLY ASKING THEIR MOMS

1022
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
HOW WAS THE PRINCIPAL.

1023
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
>> Steve: IT WAS APPARENTLY

1024
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
HER IDEA TO INSTALL THIS DOOR

1025
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
BUZZER.
ALI WAS TALKING ABOUT THE

1026
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
SAFETY DRILL.
HERE IS A TWEET SHE SENT OUT

1027
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
ON OCTOBER 17TH.

1028
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
SAFETY FIRST AT SANDY HOOK.

1029
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR OUR

1030
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
ANNUAL EVACUATION DRILL.

1031
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
THEY ALSO HAD INCLUDED ON THE

1032
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
TWEET AN IMAGE OF THAT.

1033
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
WHEN IT WAS TIME FOR THE

1034
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
INSTALLATION OF THE NEW
DOORBELL DID SEND OUT A LETTER

1035
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
TO THE PARENTS AND SAID,

1036
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
QUOTE:  PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT

1037
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
WITH NEARLY 700 STUDENTS AND

00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
OVER 1,000 PARENTS

1039
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
REPRESENTING 500 FAMILIES MOST

1040
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
PARENTS WILL BE ASKED TO SHOW

1041
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
IDENTIFICATION.

1042
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
THAT IS YOU RING THE DOORBELL

1043
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
AND THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE TO

1044
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
SHOW SOME IDENTIFICATION.

1045
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
BUT AS WE DETAILED THIS

1046
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
MORNING THERE IS A REPORT FROM

1047
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" TODAY

1048
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
THAT APPARENTLY SHE RECOGNIZED

1049
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
THE SHOOTER BECAUSE THAT WAS

1050
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
NANCY'S SON.

1051
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
SHE KNEW NANCY.

1052
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
NANCY WAS A TEACHER THERE.

1053
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
WE DON'T KNOW FULL TIME, PART

1054
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
TIME, RETIRED, WHATEVER.

1055
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
BUT BUZZED HIM IN AND WITHIN

1056
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
TWO MINUTES THAT KID WITH A

1057
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000

NOW.
YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT SPOKE

1061
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
YESTERDAY EMOTIONALLY.

1062
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
HE SAID NOT AS A PRESIDENT.

1063
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I SPEAK TO YOU NOW AS A

1064
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
PRESIDENT.

1065
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
UNDERSTANDS WHAT HE WAS GOING

1066
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
THROUGH AND WHAT WE'RE ALL

1067
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
GOING THROUGH.

1068
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
LISTEN.

1069
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
>> THOSE WHO DIED TODAY WERE

1070
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
CHILDREN.
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

1071
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS

1072
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
OLD.

1073
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

1074
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

1075
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

1076
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

1077
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
>> Steve: YESTERDAY THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

1078
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
HAD THE FACE OF THE NATION

1079
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
RIGHT THERE WIPING AWAY THE

00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
TEAR.

MORE.

1082
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
SEEMS LIKE WE ARE AURORA

00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
MORE AND MORE HEARING ABOUT

1087
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
THE SAME THEMES.

1088
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
>> EVIL.

1089
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000

UNITY YESTERDAY.

1099
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
THE HORROR OF THIS DAY SEEMS

1100
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
SO UNBEARABLE THE OHIO

1101
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
LAWMAKER SAID WE WILL LOCK

1102
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
ARMS AND UNITE AS CITIZENS FOR

1104
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
ABOVE UNSPEAKABLE EVIL.

1105

1280
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
WEARING A BULLET-PROOF VEST.

1281
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
SO YOU KNOW HE JUST DIDN'T

1282
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
WAKE UP YESTERDAY MORNING AND

1283
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
SAY I'M GOING TO GO DO THIS.

1284
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I BELIEVE THIS WAS A PLANNED

1285
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
EVENT.

1286
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
>> IT WAS HIS MOM'S GUNS

1287
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
EVIDENTLY.

1288
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
THEY WERE ALL REGISTERED AND

1289
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
ALL LEGAL.
THE RIFLE THAT HE HAD IN THE

1290
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
CAR WAS EVIDENTLY USED FOR BIG

1291
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
GAME HUNTING.

1292
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
HERE IS A QUOTE FROM HIS

1293
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
NEIGHBOR AND CLASSMATE TIM

1294
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
DALTON NOT HIS FRIEND.

1295
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
HE SAID AS HORRIBLE AS THIS

1296
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
WAS, I CAN'T SAY I AM

1297
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
SURPRISED.
BURN IN HELL, ADAM.

1298
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
WE SEE ALL THESE RED FLAGS.

1299
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE THAT

1300
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
COULD SAY THAT ABOUT OTHER

1301
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
POTENTIAL ASSASSINS OR IS THIS

1302
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
OBVIOUSLY A GUY THAT'S CAPABLE

1303
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
OF THIS?

1304
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
>> WELL, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A

1305
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
GUY THAT'S CAPABLE OF IT

1306
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
BECAUSE HE DID IT YESTERDAY.

1307
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
HERE IS THE THING AND YOU HIT

1308
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
THE NAIL ON THE HEAD.

1309
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
THERE HAD TO BE WARNING SIGNS

1310
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
AND APPARENTLY THE FRIEND OF

1311
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
THE SHOOTER KNEW ABOUT SOME OF

1312
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
THESE WARNING SIGNS BECAUSE

1313
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
THAT'S WHY HE MADE THE

1314
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
STATEMENT THAT HE DID.

1315
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
YOU KNOW, THE POLICE AND THE

1316
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
FBI RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE IN

1317
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
THREE DIFFERENT STATES THIS

1318
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
MORNING, BRIAN, INTERVIEWING

1319
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
ASSOCIATES, RELATIVES OF THE

1320
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
SHOOTER.

1321
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TRYING

1322
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
TO FIND OUT RIGHT NOW?

1323
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT IF

1324
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
THERE WERE WARNING SIGNS.

1325
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
NOR ABOUT THIS GUY'S HISTORY

1326
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
EVEN IF IT WAS A MENTAL ISSUE.

1327
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND THIS

1328
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
OUT TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT

1329
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
WAS IT THAT WAS THE SPARK THAT

1330
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
IGNITED HIM YESTERDAY.

1331
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
>> ROD, HERE'S THE THING.

1332
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
THERE IS THE AURORA SHOOTING.

1333
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
THIS GUY WAS DEFINITELY

1334
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
DERANGED, SIGNS OF SHOWING

1335
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
THAT HE WAS DERAKED.

1336
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
PEOPLE SAY HE WAS REALLY OFF

1337
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
AND HIS OWN THERAPIST SAYING

1338
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
RELATIVELY SQUARED FOR HIM.

1339
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
AS WE FIND OUT THAT THIS GUY

1340
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
WAS A DANGER AND SCARED

1341
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
EVERYBODY IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

1342
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
IN THE FUTURE, HOW CAN WE STOP

1343
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
THE NEXT MULTIPLE SHOOTING IF

1344
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
BEFORE IT HAPPENS WHILE STILL

1345
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
GUARDING AGAINST PEOPLE'S

1346
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
FREEDOM?
>> YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.

1347
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEAK

1348
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
UP.
I WAS JUST TEACHING A COURSE

1349
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
YESTERDAY, BRIAN, I DON'T KNOW

1350
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
IF YOU HEARD, HERE IN

1351
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
MINNESOTA ON ACTIVE SHOOTER

1352
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
RESPONSE TRAINING TO A MAJOR

1353
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
COMPANY.
AND ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS

1354
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
TELLING THOSE FOLKS IS THAT

1355
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
WHEN YOU SEE THESE WARNING

1356
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
SIGNS, YOU CAN'T WORRY ABOUT

1357
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
PROFILING.
YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP TO

1358
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
SOMEBODY.
AT THE VERY MINIMUM NOTIFY THE

1359
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
POLICE DEPARTMENT SO THAT WE

1360
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
CAN CHECK THESE INDIVIDUALS

1361
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
OUT, BRIAN.

1362
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT IT TO

1363
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
BE A DAY TOO LATE.

1364
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I GUARANTEE THERE ARE PEOPLE

1365
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
THAT ARE GOING TO COME FORWARD

1366
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
NOW THAT IS GOING TO SAY I

1367
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
WISH I WOULD HAVE SPOKE UP.

1368
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
IF IT'S MEDICATION HE NEEDS TO

1369
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
BE ON AND HE DOESN'T TAKE IT

1370
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
AT 20 YEARS OLD THERE IS

1371
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
NOTHING WE CAN DO TO MAKE HIM

1372
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
TAKE IT, CORRECT?

1373
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
>> NO, NO.

1374
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
HE CAN BE PROBATED IF AN

1375
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
INDIVIDUAL IS ORDERED BY THE

1376
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
COURT TO TAKE THEIR MEDICATION

1377
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
AND THEY DO NOT TAKE IT, WE

1378
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
CAN GET THAT PERSON PROBATED

1379
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
AND HAVE THEM FORCE THE

1380
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
MEDICATION.

1381
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
>> Brian: INTERESTING.

1382
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
11 MINUTES BEFORE THE TOP OF
THE HOUR.

1383
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
ROD WHEELER THANKS SO MUCH.

1384
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
>> THANK YOU, BRIAN.

1385
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
>> Brian: THANK YOU YOUR

1386
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
ANALYSIS.

1387
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
AS WE MOVE STRAIGHT AHEAD.

1388
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
SOME PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHAT

1389
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
IS HAPPENING TO THE CULTURE OF

1390
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
AMERICA?

1391
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
ARE WE CHANGING OR ARE WE JUST

1392
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
NOTICING MORE?

1393
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
FATHER JONATHAN MORRIS HERE

1394
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
LIVE NEXT.

00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Share "Not even close."

1396
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Share "You owe me..."

1397
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Share "Just right."

1398
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
The Share Everything Plan.

1401
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Get a Droid Razr M

1402
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
by Motorola for $49.99.

1403
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
>> Alisyn: YOU ARE LOOKING AT

1404
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
PRAYER VIGILS HELD FOR THE

1405
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
MASSACRE.

1406
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
HOW CAN CHILDREN AND FAMILY

1407
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
PICK UP THE PIECES AFTER ONE

1408
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
OF THE DEADLIEST SHOOTINGS IN

1409
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
U.S. HISTORY.

1410
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
>> Steve: WE NOW TURN TO FOX

1411
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
NEWS RELIGION CORRESPONDENT

1412
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
JONATHAN MORRIS WHO WE TURN TO

1413
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
IN TIMES LIKE THIS GOOD

1414
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
MORNING.
>> GOOD MORNING, THANK YOU.

1415
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
>> Steve: WHAT DO YOU THINK.
>> CERTAINLY THERE IS NO

1416
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
EXPLANATION THAT WE CAN GIVE

1417
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
TO WHY GOD ALLOWS THIS TO

1418
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
HAPPEN.

1419
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
WHY IT DID HAPPEN.
WE DO KNOW IT'S NOT A

1420
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
SENSELESS ACT LIKE WE HEAR

1421
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
FROM SO MANY POLITICIANS AND

1422
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
EVEN SOMETIMES RELIGIOUS

1423
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
LEADERS IT'S NOT SENSELESS,

1424
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
COMBINATION MENTAL ILLNESS,

1425
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
FREE CHOICE, DECIDING TO GO

1426
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
AND DO SOMETHING VERY VERY BAD

1427
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
THIRD I THINK THE POWER OF

1428
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
EVIL.
THE POWER OF EVIL WHEN WE

1429
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
ALLOW OURSELVES OR BECAUSE OF

1430
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
MENTAL ILLNESS TO GET INVOLVED

1431
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
IN OUR MIND AND IN OUR HEART

1432
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
OF SUCH A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE

1433
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
THING LIKE KILLING SOMEBODY,

1434
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
THE DEVIL, IN MY OPINION, GETS

1435
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
INVOLVED AND THE POWER OF EVIL

1436
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
TAKES OVER.

1437
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
>> Alisyn: WHAT ARE WE

1438
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT THIS.

1439
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
YOU WROTE A BOOK A COUPLE OF

1440
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
YEARS AGO ABOUT SUFFERING AND

1441
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
DEALING WITH TRAGEDY AND WHAT

1442
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
PRIESTS ALWAYS SAY IS THAT GOD

1443
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
CAN'T PREVENT THESE THINGS

1444
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
FROM HAPPENING BUT GOD IS WITH

1445
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
YOU.

1446
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
>> THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

1447
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
WE CAN NEVER GIVE A PERFECT

1448
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
EXPLANATION.

1449
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
GOD CAN'T STOP IT.

1450
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
HE CAN'T K. IF HE WANTS.

1451
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
HE USUALLY DOES NOT.

1452
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
THEN WE NO LONGER WOULD HAVE

1453
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
FREE WILL.

1454
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
WE -8D BE REBOTS.

1455
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
WE COULDN'T DO BAD BUT WE ALSO

1456
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
COULDN'T LOVE.
THERE WOULD BE NO RELATIONSHIP

1457
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
MAN OR GOD EVEN AMONG

1458
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
OURSELVES IF THERE WAS NO FREE

1459
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
WILL.

1460
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
BUT, WHEN THERE ARE CHILDREN

1461
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
KILLED, WE SAY WELL WHY, AT

1462
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
LEAST IN THIS INSTANCE DIDN'T

1463
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
GOD INTERVENE.

1464
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
IF THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS

1465
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
HEAVEN.
IF THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS

1466
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
ETERNAL LIFE THEN YOU HAVE TO

1467
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
SAY THAT GOD IS AN EVIL, EVIL

1468
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
BEING.

1469
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I BELIEVE GOD BRINGS OUT A

1470
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
GREATER GOOD OUT OF EVERY

1471
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
SINGLE INSTANCE OF EVIL AND

1472
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
SUFFERING IN THIS WORLD THAT'S

1473
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
WHAT I HAVE WROTE ABOUT.

1474
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
BUT SOMETIMES THAT GREATER

1475
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
GOOD ONLY COMES OUT IN

1476
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
ETERNITY.

1477
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
WHAT DO PARENTS DO RIGHT NOW

1478
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
OR WHAT DO WE DO FOR THE

1479
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
PARENTS?
WE HUG THEM.

1480
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
THEY HUG EACH OTHER.

1481
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
PART OF GOD'S SOLUTION TO THIS

1482
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
GREAT EVIL THAT WAS CARRIED

1483
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
OUT NOT BY GOD BUT BY A HUMAN

1484
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
BEING IS OUR LOVE FOR ONE

1485
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
ANOTHER.
OUR LOVE FOR ANOTHER IS WHAT

1486
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
WE CAN GIVE TO THESE FAMILIES

1487
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
RIGHT NOW.

1488
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
AND THERE IS LOVE BEING SENT

1489
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
FROM ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY

1490
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
RIGHT NOW.

1491
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
>> Steve: YESTERDAY WAS A BIG

1492
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
DAY FOR PRAYER ASIDE FROM THE

1493
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
FACT THAT PEOPLE WOULD

1494
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
SPONTANEOUSLY SEE THE EVIL

1495
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
IMAGES AND DO THAT ON THEIR

1496
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
OWN.
LAST NIGHT THE CONNECTICUT

1497
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
GOVERNOR MALOY SAID ADD THESE

1498
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
FAMILIES IN YOUR PRAYERS.

1499
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
SAY A PRAY FOR THE CHILDREN.

1500
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1501
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
ABSOLUTELY.

1502
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I GET THAT ALL THE TIME COMING

1503
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST

1504
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
WANTING TO BE A PART OF IT.

1505
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I PUT A VERY SIMPLE TWEET OUT

1506
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
YESTERDAY SAYING I LIVE ONLY

1507
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
60 MILES AWAY FROM THIS

1508
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
TRAGEDY.
IF ANYBODY NEEDS SPIRITUAL

1509
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
GUIDANCE OR COMFORT IF I CAN

1510
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
BE OF HELP.

1511
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT GETS

1512
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
RETWEETED ALL OVER THE PLACE.

1513
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
ONE OF THE FAMILIES CONTACTED

1514
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
ME.
SOMEBODY PUT KNEE IN CONTACT

1515
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
WITH THE PRIEST AT THAT

1516
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
PERISH.

1517
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
AMAZING ABILITY NOW TO BE ABLE

1518
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
TO COME TOGETHER EVEN USING

1519
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
NEW TECHNOLOGY.

1520
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
>> THAT'S REALLY NICE.

1521
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
THE RAP ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS

1522
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
THAT IT SORT OF SEPARATES US.

1523
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
YOU HAVE VIRTUAL FRIENDS BUT

1524
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
TO BE ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE AT

1525
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
THAT DISTANCE IS ALSO REALLY

1526
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
NICE.

1527
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
WE WILL CHECK BACK IN WITH

1528
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
YOU, FATHER.

1529
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING

1530
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
HERE.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

1531
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
>> Steve: WE WILL RETURN IN
TWO MINUTES.

1532
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
YOU ARE WATCHING THE FOX NEWS

1533
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,000
CHANNEL.
I'M DOING MY OWN SLEEP STUDY.

1534
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
ADVIL PM® OR TYLENOL PM.

1535
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
THE ADVIL PM® GUY

1536
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
IS SPENDING LESS TIME
LYING AWAKE

1537
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
WITH ANNOYING ACHES AND PAINS
AND MORE TIME ASLEEP.

1538
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
ADVIL PM®. THE DIFFERENCE
IS A BETTER NIGHT'S SLEEP.

1539
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
WITH ANNOYING ACHES AND PAINS
AND MORE TIME ASLEEP.
It's hard to see opportunity

1540
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
in today's challenging
environment.

1541
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Unless you have the right
perspective.

1542
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
BNY Mellon Wealth Management
has the vision

1543
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
and experience to look beyond
the obvious.

1544
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
We'll uncover opportunities,
find hidden risk,

1545
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
and make success a reality.

1546
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
BNY Mellon Wealth Management

1547
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
But when I was in an accident...

1548
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I was worried the
health care system

1549
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
spoke a language all its own

1550
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
With UnitedHealthcare,
I got help that fit my life.

1551
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So I never missed a beat.

1552
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,000
That's health in numbers.
UnitedHealthcare.

1553
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
>> THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO

1554
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
DIED TODAY WERE CHILDREN,

1555
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

1556
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS

1557
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
OLD.

1558
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,000
[SIGH]

1559
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

1560
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
AHEAD OF THEM, BIRTHDAYS,

1561
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,000
GRADUATIONS, WEDDINGS, KIDS OF

1562
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
THEIR OWN.

1563
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
[SIGH]

1564
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

1565
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
TEACHERS, MEN AND WOMEN WHO

1566
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING

1567
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
THEIR CHILDREN TO FULFILL

1568
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
THEIR DREAMS.

1569
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
SO OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY

1570
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
FOR THE PARENTS AND

1571
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
GRANDPARENTS, SISTERS AND

1572
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE

1573
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
CHILDREN AND FOR THE FAMILIES

1574
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
OF THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST.

1575
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
>> Steve: GOOD MORNING,

1576
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO SPECIAL
EDITION OF "FOX & FRIENDS."

1577
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
BRIAN AND I JOIN ALI TODAY FOR

THIS SPECIAL COVERAGE.

1579
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
THIS MORNING AS THE WORLD

1580
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
WAKES UP AND LOOKS AT THE 26

1581
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
DEAD THERE IN NEWTOWN,

1582
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
CONNECTICUT, PEOPLE ARE ASKING

1583
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
THE QUESTION WHY.

1584
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
WHY DID THAT 20-YEAR-OLD KID

1585
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
GET UP YESTERDAY MORNING,

1586
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
MURDER HIS MOTHER AND THEN

1587
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
DRIVE TO THE SCHOOL SHE WORKED

1588
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
IN AND KILLED 20 KIDS?

1589
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
>> OR WAS HE PLANNING THIS FOR

1590
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
A LONG TIME FROM THE AMMO TO

1591
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
THE GUNS.

1592
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
HE DIDN'T MISS.

1593
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
WORD IS IN THREE MINUTES, THE

1594
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
GUY DIDN'T MISS.

1595
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
AND HE SPREAD OVER 100 ROUNDS.

1596
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
>> DEADLY ACCURATE.

1597
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
ONLY ONE PERSON WAS INJURED.

1598
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
EVERYBODY ELSE WAS FATALLY

1599
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
SHOT.

1600
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
>> THATS WHAT A TEACHER THAT

1601
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
THREW HERSELVES IN FRONT OF A

1602
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
CLASSROOM AND A DOOR AND GOT

1603
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
SHOT IN THE ARM AND THE LEG.

1604
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
>> Alisyn: HOPELY WE WILL GET

1605
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
ANSWERS.
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE BEGS FOR

1606
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
AFTER SOMETHING LIKE THIS

1607
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
HAPPENS FIGURE OUT WHY IT

1608
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
HAPPENS SO WE CAN PREVENT THEY M

1609
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
IN THE FUTURE.

1610
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
CAN I TELL YOU FROM COVERING

1611
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
CRIME FOR FIVE YEARS AND

TALKING TO MURDERERS IN THEIR

01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
PRISON CELLS IT'S A FOOL'S

1614
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
ERRAND.
THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD

01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
EXPLANATION THAT END UP MAKING

1616
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
SENSE.
>> Steve: THAT'S THE KEY.

1617
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
WE WANT AN EASY ANSWER.
WE WANT TO KNOW WHY HE DID IT.

1618
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
BUT WHEN YOU'RE CRAZY.

1619
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
WHEN YOU ARE EVIL AS HE SURELY

1620
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
WAS, WE MAY NEVER KNOW.

1621
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
>> Brian: RIGHT.

1622
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000

WE ARE GLAD YOU ARE WITH US.

1626

MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE

1631
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
WORKED TO POSITIVELY IDENTIFY

1632
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
THE VICTIMS.

1633
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
WE'RE TOLD THAT THERE WAS A

1634
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
TEMPORARY MORGUE SET UP SOME

1635
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000

THAT'S WHERE AUTHORITIES TOOK

1638
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
THE YOUNG VICTIMS AND THEY

01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
PHOTOGRAPHED THEM SO THAT THEY

01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
COULD SHOW THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS

1641
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
TO THEIR PARENTS.

1642
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
ALL 20 CHILDREN WHO WERE

1643
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
KILLED WERE BETWEEN THE AGES

1644
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
OF 5 AND 10.

1645
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
IT IS A NIGHTMARE HERE IN

1646
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
NEWTOWN FOR EVERYONE WHO IS

1647
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
EVEN IN THE MOST SLIGHT WAY

1648
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
INVOLVED.
NOW, THE 20-YEAR-OLD MASS

1649
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
MURDERER, ADAM LANZA USED AT

1650
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
LEAST THREE GUNS YESTERDAY.

1651
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
THEY WERE ALL LEGALLY

1652
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
REGISTERED TO HIS MOTHER NANCY

1653
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
LANZA, ADAM SHOT HIS MOM NANCY

1654
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
BEFORE HEADING TO THIS SCHOOL

1655
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
AND HE DID MOST OF HIS KILLING

1656
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,000
IN JUST TWO CLASSROOMS.

1657
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
>> THE INDIVIDUAL THAT I HAVE

1658
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
ON THE PHONE IS CONTINUING TO

1659
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
HEAR WHAT HE BELIEVES TO BE

1660
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
GUNFIRE.

1661
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
>> UNITS IN THE SCHOOL.

1662
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I HAVE GOT BODIES HERE.

1663
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
>> ONCE THE SHOOTING STARTED.

1664
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
WE'RE TOLD THAT STUDENTS HEARD

1665
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
SCREAMING OVER THE SCHOOL'S

1666
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
INTERCOM SYSTEM.

1667
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
TEACHERS EVENTUALLY EVACUATED

1668
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
STUDENTS TO A NEARBY FIREHOUSE

1669
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
AND PARENTS WERE TOLD, MANY

1670
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
PARENTS, THAT THEIR KIDS

1671
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
WERE -- THAT THERE WERE

1672
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
CHILDREN AT THE FIREHOUSE.

1673
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
THEY DIDN'T KNOW IF THEIR

1674
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
CHILD MADE IT TO THE

1675
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
FIREHOUSE.
A LOT OF THESE PARENTS JUST

1676
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
KNEW THAT THE CHILDREN WHO

1677
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
MADE IT WERE AT THE FIREHOUSE

1678
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
AND THEY WERE SHOWING UP NOT

1679
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
KNOWING IF THEIR CHILD WAS

1680
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
ALIVE OR DEAD.

1681
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
>> ARE YOU TRYING TO FIND YOUR

1682
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
CHILD, MA'AM?

1683
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
>> NO.

1684
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
MY GIRLFRIEND'S DAUGHTER, MY

1685
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
BABYSITTER.

1686
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
HER AND MY LITTLE DAUGHTER ARE

1687
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
LIKE BEST FRIENDS AND THEY

1688
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
JUST TOLD US GO TO MALOY.

1689
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
THEY TOLD US IF YOU CAN'T FIND

01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
YOUR CHILDREN, THEY ARE DEAD

1691
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
IN THE BUILDING.

1692
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
>> IN CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR

1693
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
DANIEL MALOY SAID EVIL VISITED

1694
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
THIS COMMUNITY YESTERDAY AND

1695
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
FROM EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE

1696
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
HEARD AND EVERYTHING THAT WE

1697
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,000
HAVE SEEN, HE WAS SPOT ON BACK

1698
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
TO YOU IN NEW YORK.

1699
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1700
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
THERE IS A FULLER PICTURE OF

1701
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
WHO ADAM LANZA WAS.

1702
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
THERE IS INFORMATION COMING

1703
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
OUT ABOUT THIS GUNMAN.

1704
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
GREW UP IN NEWTOWN, DIVORCED

1705
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
IN 2008 OR 2008.

1706
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
HE THEN LIVED WITH HIS MOTHER

1707
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
APPARENTLY ALONE IN NEWTOWN

1708
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
BECAUSE HIS BROTHER LIVED IN

1709
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
NEW JERSEY.

1710
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
>> SHE WORKED FOR THE SCHOOL

1711
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
SYSTEM ALTHOUGH IT'S UNCERTAIN

1712
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
EXACTLY WHAT HER STATUS WAS AT

1713
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
THE TIME OF THE MURDER.

1714
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
>> WAS SHE A SUBSTITUTE?

1715
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
WAS SHE PART TIME?

1716
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
>> AN AIDE?

1717
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
>> Brian: WAS SHE RETIRED OR

1718
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
DID SHE STEP ASIDE TO SPEND

1719
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
MORE TIME WITH HER TROUBLED

1720
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
SON?

1721
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
>> Alisyn: THAT WAS ONE REPORT

1722
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
AS WELL.
THEN THERE WERE GUNS THAT WERE

1723
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
FOUND AT THE SCENE AND THEY

1724
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
APPARENTLY WERE REGISTERED TO

1725
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
HIS MOTHER, NANCY LANZA.

1726
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
THAT'S AN INTERESTING POINT

1727
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
RIGHT THERE.

1728
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY

1729
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS GUNS IS

1730
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHERE

1731
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
YOU LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY.

1732
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT THERE

1733
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
WAS LIKE ONE CRIME THERE SINCE

1734
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
2010.

1735
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
ONE VIOLENT CRIME.

1736
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
AGAIN, IN CONNECTICUT, THESE

1737
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
NOT -- THIS IS NOT TEXAS OR

1738
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
THE EAST COAST NEAR NEW YORK

1739
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
WE HAVE A DIFFERENT

1740
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH ONES.

1741
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
FOR A WOMAN TO HAVE THREE GUNS

1742
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
ONE OF THEM POSSIBLY THIS

1743
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC THAT HE USED

1744
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
IT'S INTERESTING THAT SHE HAD

1745
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
THESE GUNS.

1746
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
WHO KNOWS WHY BUT IT'S ALSO

1747
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
POSSIBLE THAT HE HIMSELF WAS

1748
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
TROUBLED.
THERE ARE LOTS OF REPORTS FROM

1749
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
NEIGHBORS THAT THE SON WHO

1750
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
LIVED WITH HER ADAM WAS A

1751
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
TROUBLED KID SOMEHOW.

1752
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
>> Brian: AS EARLY AS 5 YEARS

1753
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
OLD IN TERMS OF THE WEAPONS HE

1754
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
USED A GLOCK, AN SIG SOWER, IF

1755
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I HAVE SAID THAT WRONG EXCUSE

1756
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
ME.

1757
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
A BUSH RIFLE WAS LEFT IN THE

1758
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
CAR.
>> AS CAN YOU SEE FROM THAT

1759
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
GRAPHIC BROTHER TOLD

1760
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
AUTHORITIES THAT HE WAS

1761
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
AUTISTIC AND SOME OF THE

1762
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
NEIGHBORS SAID YEAH, HE WAS
NOT WELL.

1763
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
>> Alisyn: WANT TO CLARIFY

1764
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
THAT AS WELL.

1765
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
HIS BROTHER SAID AUTISTIC AND

1766
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
SAID I THINK HE HAD AS

1767
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
BERGER'S SYSTEM WHICH IS A

1768
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
VERY DIFFERENT PLACE ON THE

1769
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
SPECTRUM FOR AUTISM.

1770
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
VERY HIGH FUNCTIONING.

1771
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
DESCRIBED AS A GENIUS.

1772
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
DESCRIBED AS A GREAT STUDENT.

1773
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
DESCRIBED AS A COMPUTER NERD

1774
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
AND HE HAD A PERSONALITY

1775
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
DISORDER.

1776
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
>> Steve: WHATEVER IT WAS, HE

1777
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
WAS EVIL YESTERDAY.

1778
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
ANY TIME YOU START THE DAY BY

1779
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
MURDERING YOUR MOTHER AND THEN

1780
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
TAKING HER CAR TO THE SCHOOL

1781
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
AND, OF COURSE NOW WE ARE

1782
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
TRYING TO PIECE IT ALL

1783
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
TOGETHER AND TRYING IT TALK TO

1784
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
AS MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED AS WE

1785
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
CAN.

1786
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
>> Alisyn: NEXT GUEST LIVES
THROUGH THE MOST TERRIFYING

1787
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
MOMENTS OF HIS LIFE YESTERDAY

1788
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
WHEN HE HEARS GUNSHOTS COMING

1789
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
FROM HIS LITTLE SISTER'S

1790
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
SCHOOL FROM HIS HOME.

1791
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
THEY RAN THERE AND ARRIVED

1792
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
BEFORE MANY OF THE FIRST

1793
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
RESPONDERS.
PLEASE TELL US WHAT HAPPENED

1794
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
YESTERDAY AT 9:30 THAT YOU

1795
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
STARTED TO HEAR.

1796
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
>> WELL, BASICALLY I WAS AT

1797
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
HOME FROM SCHOOL THAT DAY.

1798
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
WE HEARD -- MY NEIGHBOR AND I

1799
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
HEARD TWO GUNSHOTS ECHO

1800
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY OPEN AREA.

1801
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
AS SOON AS WE HEARD THE ECHOS

1802
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
WE RAN TO THE SCHOOL WITH MY

1803
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
MOM TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

1804
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
AND THAT'S WHERE WE SAW THE

1805
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
STATE TROOPERS THERE.

1806
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
>> Brian: WHAT TIME WAS THAT

1807
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
ABOUT, DO YOU KNOW?

1808
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
>> I WANT TO SAY ABOUT 9:45.

1809
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
>> Steve: YOU GOT THERE BEFORE

1810
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS, RIGHT?

1811
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
>> WELL, THERE WERE SOME FIRST

1812
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
RESPONDERS THERE.

1813
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
THERE WERE THE LOCAL POLICE

1814
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
AND THERE WERE SOME STATE

1815
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
TROOPERS.
BUT IT WAS NOT A HEAVILY

1816
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
SECURED AREA WHEN I WAS THERE.

1817
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I WAS THERE VERY EARLY IN THE

1818
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
RUNNING.
>> DID YOU GO TO THE FRONT

1819
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
DOOR MERGINM?

1820
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
>> EXCUSE ME.

1821
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000

01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
PARENT TO IMAGINE WHAT THE

2179
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
MOMS AND DADS OF THE VICTIMS

2180
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000

2181
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
SCHOOL ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT

2182
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
NOW.

2183
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
OUR NEXT GUEST UNDERSTANDS

2184
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
THEIR POSITION AND PAIN ALL

2185
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
TOO WELL.

2186
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
BETH LOST DAUGHTER RACHEL JOY

2187
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
SCOTT IN THE COLUMBINE
SHOOTING IN COLORADO AND HER

2188
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
SON CRAIG WITNESSED THE

2189
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
TRAGEDY AND SURVIVED.

2190
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
SHE JOINS US THIS MORNING FROM

2191
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
DENVER.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU, BETH.

2192
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
>> GOOD MORNING.

2193
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD FOR US

2194
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
LOOKING INTO IMAGINE WHAT

2195
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
THOSE PARENTS ARE GOING

2196
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
THROUGH.

2197
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
YOU KNOW, WE JUST HEARD FROM

2198
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
OUR CORRESPONDENT THEY HAVE

2199
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
APPARENTLY SET UP A MAKESHIFT

2200
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
MORGUE AND NOW THE PARENTS ARE

2201
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
STARTING TO IDENTIFY THEIR

2202
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
CHILDREN BY PICTURES.

2203
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
YOU WENT THROUGH THIS A NUMBER

2204
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
OF YEARS AGO.

2205
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
>>
>> I DID.

2206
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,000
>> WHAT ARE THEY GOING

2207
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
THROUGH?

2208
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
THAT TIME OF WAITING THERE IS

2209
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
MIXED FEELINGS.

2210
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
YOU HAVE SOME HOPE.

2211
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
AND YET, THERE IS THIS

2212
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
IMPENDING DOOM THAT BECAUSE

2213
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOUR

2214
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
CHILD OR THERE IS NO NEWS

2215
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
ABOUT THEM THAT THE WORST IS

2216
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
TO BE EXPECTED AND FOR US IT

2217
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
TOOK EXACTLY 24 HOURS FOR WHEN

2218
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
RACHEL PASSED AWAY TO GET A

2219
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
CALL FROM THE CORONER.

2220
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
WE DIDN'T IDENTIFY HER.

2221
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
THEY IDENTIFIED HER THROUGH

2222
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
SOME FINGERPRINTS THAT I HAD

2223
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
MADE UP AS MY KIDS WERE

2224
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
LITTLE.
AND SHE WAS IDENTIFIED THAT

2225
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
WAY.

2226
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
>> JUST THE WAITING, YOU SAY

2227
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
THAT IT TOOK YOU 24 HOURS.

2228
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
THEY KNOW, YOU KNOW, ALL THE

2229
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
OTHER PARENTS WERE REUNITED

2230
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

2231
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
THEY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO

2232
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
THEM AND YET THEY HAVE GOT TO

2233
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
AWAIT FORMAL WORD.
>> YEAH.

2234
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
THAT WAS THE HARDEST PART.

2235
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
FOR US WE WERE TOLD THAT

2236
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
EVENING TO GO HOME AND THAT NO

2237
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
MORE INFORMATION WAS FORTH

2238
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
COMING.
THAT WAS JUST ABOUT THE

2239
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
CRUELEST THING WE COULD HAVE

2240
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
BEEN TOLD AT THAT POINT IN

2241
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
TIME BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T

2242
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
RELEASING NAMES OF VICTIMS.

2243
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
BUT THERE WERE STUDENTS THAT

2244
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
HAD SEEN RACHEL'S BODY SO WE

2245
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,000
WERE GETTING RECORDS REPORTS

2246
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,000
FROM THEM EVEN THOUGH IT WAS

2247
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
VERIFIED BY AUTHORITIES.

2248
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
IT'S A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.

2249
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
IT'S THE SADDEST THING.

2250
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
YOU WANT TO HOLD ON TO HOPE

2251
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
BUT IN YOUR MIND YOU KNOW THAT

2252
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
IT'S GONE.

2253
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
>> BETH, I UNDERSTAND YOU TOLD

2254
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS THAT THE

2255
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN WHO

2256
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
WERE LOST YESTERDAY THEY ARE

2257
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
NOT GOING TO KNOW WHAT HIT

2258
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
THEM FOR A WHILE.

2259
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
>> THEY WON'T.

2260
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I BELIEVE IT WAS WELL INTO A

2261
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
YEAR BEFORE I COULD GRASP WHAT

2262
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
REALLY HAPPENED.

2263
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,000
THE GRIEF AND THE PAIN IS SO

2264
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
TREMENDOUS.
IT'S SO -- IT'S IT LIKE YOUR

2265
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
BREATH IS TAKEN AWAY.

2266
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
YOUR HEART IS RACING.

2267
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
YOU CAN'T BREATHE.

2268
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
YOU CAN'T THINK.

2269
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
AND SO SOMETIMES YOU ARE IN A

2270
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
SURREAL SITUATION.

2271
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
AND IT COMES AND GOES.

2272
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
SOMETIMES IT'S REAL AND

2273
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE JUST A

2274
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
LIVING NIGHTMARE.
AND YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO

2275
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY IT'S

2276
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
GOING TO BE BETTER.

2277
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
AND IT TAKES A LONG TIME.

2278
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I THINK FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND

2279
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
THE REALITY OF WHAT HAPPENED

2280
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
AND REALLY BE ABLE TO DEAL

2281
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
WITH THE REALITY, RATHER THAN

2282
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
ALL OF THE SUPERFICIAL THAT'S

2283
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

2284
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
>> Steve: RIGHT.
>> THERE IS SO MUCH.

2285
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
THERE IS A LOT OF MEDIA.

2286
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
THERE IS A LOT OF TALK.

2287
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
AND IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO

2288
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS REAL AND

2289
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
WHAT WASN'T.

2290
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:42,000
SHE AND I WERE JUST IN THAT

2291
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
PARTICULAR CASE YOU BLAME THE

2292
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
YOUNG MAN WHO TOOK YOUR

2293
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
DAUGHTER'S LIFE AND THE LIVES

2294
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
OF SO MANY OTHER OUT THERE

2295
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
THEY WERE EVIL INCARNATE ON

2296
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
EARTH AND YOU WERE ANGRY FOR A

2297
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
WHILE.
YOU ARE NOT ANGRY ANYMORE.

2298
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO

2299
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,000
GET TO THAT STAGE?

2300
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
IT TOOK QUITE A WHILE.

2301
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HELPED

2302
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
WE WERE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING

2303
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
ABOUT RACHEL'S WRITINGS AND

2304
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
JOURNALS AND DRAWINGS THAT SHE

2305
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
LEFT BEHIND AND THAT KIND OF

2306
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:16,000
GAVE US A PLATFORM TO START

2307
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
COOL PROGRAMS AND DO A LOT OF

2308
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
SPEAKING TO LOOK AT THE GOOD

2309
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
THAT COULD COME OUT OF IT THAT

2310
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
WAS A VERY HEALING POINT.

2311
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
AND ONCE WE SAW THAT, WE WERE

2312
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,000
ABLE TO PUT THINGS IN A BETTER

2313
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
PERSPECTIVE I DON'T BELIEVE IT

2314
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
WAS RACHEL'S TIME TO DIE BUT

2315
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
SHE DID.

2316
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:37,000
AS A RESULT WE WERE ABLE TO

2317
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
MOVE FORWARD AND TURN

2318
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
SOMETHING EVIL INTO GOOD.

2319
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
THAT BROUGHT A LOT OF HEALING.

2320
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
THAT ALSO HELPED DEAL WITH THE

2321
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
ANGER AND FRUSTRATION OF

2322
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
LOSING HER.

2323
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
BUT I STILL HAD TO DEAL WITH

2324
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
CRAIG WHO WAS EXTREMELY

2325
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
TRAUMATIZED.
SUFFERED FROM PTSD FOR A LONG

2326
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
TIME.
AND MY CONCERN WAS I WOULD

2327
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
HAVE TWO COLUMBINE VICTIMS.

2328
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
ONE FROM THE SHOOTING AND ONE

2329
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
FROM EMOTIONAL CRIPPLE.

2330
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
>> Steve: SURE.

2331
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
>> RELIVING DAY IN AND DAY OUT

2332
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:12,000
WHAT HE EXPERIENCED.

2333
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
IT TOOK HIM ALMOST TWO YEARS

2334
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
BEFORE I SAW HIM TURN A CORNER

2335
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
AND BECOME A REGULAR TEENAGER

2336
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
AGAIN AND START

2337
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
LIFE WHICH HE HAS DONE IN A

2338
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
VERY POWERFUL WAY NOW.

2339
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
>> Steve: YOU GIVE VERY

2340
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
POWERFUL WITNESS TO WHAT

2341
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
HAPPENED TO THE PARENTS THERE.

People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

2360
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

2361
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

2362
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
It's not real.

2363
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

2364
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

2365
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

2366
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

2367
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
For thos...this...ions of doing
this...

2368
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
...and this,

2369
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
dancing in their heads...

2370
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
...we have these.

2371
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Home Depot gift cards.

2372
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Give the gift of doing,

2373
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
in-store or online.

2374
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000

CRIME.

FROM ALL OVER THE STATE RACED

2394
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
TO THAT AREA AS THEY CONVERGED

2395
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,000
ON THE SCHOOL.

2396
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
THE CHILDREN OBVIOUSLY WERE

2397
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
VERY SHAKEN.

2398
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
THEY WERE CRYING IN THE

2399
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
CLOSET.

2400
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
WHEN THEY WERE LEAVING THE

2401
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
POLICE MADE THEM HOLD HANS AND

2402
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
TOLD THEM TO CLOSE THEIR EYES.

2403
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
>> THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

2404
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

2405
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

STAY AGAINST THE WALL AND

2409
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,000
EVERYBODY STARTED TO KIND OF

2410
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
PANICKING NO WORDS, SHEAR

2411
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
TERROR.
>> IT DOES NOT SEEM REAL.

2412
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT'S

2413
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
EVEN POSSIBLE.

2414
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000

OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

2419
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
KIDS WERE TERRIFIED.

2420
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
THEY HAD JUST WITNESSED

2421
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,000
SOMETHING AND THEY WERE

2422
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,000

PRINCIPAL BUZZED IN THE WOULD

2438
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
BE ASSASSIN.

2440
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
SECURITY SYSTEM THEY HAD

2441
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
INSTALLED.

ABC IS REPORTING NOW AFTER

2443
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
DOING INTERVIEW WITH THE

01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
INVESTIGATOR IN CHARGE WHO
WILL HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE

2445
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
SHORTLY HE GOT IN BECAUSE HE

2446
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
SMASHED HIS WAY IN THROUGH THE

2447
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
GLASS AT THE FRONT OF THE

2448
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
SCHOOL AND THEN STORMED

2449
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
THROUGH THE HALL WHICH WOULD

2450
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
EXPLAIN WHY THE PRINCIPAL AND

2451
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST HEARD

2452
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
SOME COMMOTION, WENT TO THE

2453
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
HALL AND PERHAPS WERE HIS

2454
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
FIRST VICTIMS.

2455
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
>> Steve: THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.

2456
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
>> Alisyn: THIS IS ACCORDING

2457
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
TO GEORGE CINCO OF THE NOWTOWN

2458
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

2459
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
IT MAKES MORE SENSE THAT THE

2460
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
GUNMAN BROKE HIS WAY.

2461
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
IN HE HE SMASHED THE WINDOW

2462
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
ADJACENT TO THE DOOR HANDLE

2463
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
AND WAS ABLE TO GAIN ACCESS

2464
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
THAT WAY AND THAT DOES MAKE

2465
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
MORE SENSE.
BUT LET'S TELL YOU ABOUT THE

2466
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
STORIES.

2467
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
THE TEACHERS THE HEROIC

2468
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
TEACHERS HAD WHO KNEW WHAT TO

2469
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
DO WHO KNOWS IF THEY EVER HAD

2470
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
A DRILL OF THIS MAGNITUDE.

2471
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
STILL JUST INSTINCTIVELY THEY

2472
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
KNEW TO BARRICADE THE DOORS

2473
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
AND TO HIDE THEIR KIDS.

2474
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS 3RD

2475
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
GRADE TEACHER KATELYN ROIG

2476
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
DID.

2477
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
SHE ASSEMBLED ALL 14 OF HER

2478
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
KIDS INTO A BATHROOM THAT WAS

2479
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
CONNECTED TO THEIR CLASS AFTER

2480
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
BARRICADING THE DOOR AND SHE

2481
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
JUST SAT WITH THEM AND TOLD

2482
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
THEM TO BE AS QUIET AS

2483
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:24,000
POSSIBLE.

2484
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
I PUT ONE OF MY STUDENTS ON

2485
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
TOP OF THE TOILET.
I JEWS KNEW WE HAD TO GET IN

2486
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
THERE.
I WAS TELLING THEM IT'S GOING

2487
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
TO BE OKAY.
YOU ARE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

2488
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
I HAD PULLED THE BOOK SHELF

2489
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
BEFORE I CLOSED THE DOOR IN

2490
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
FRONT OF IT SO IT WAS

2491
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
COMPLETELY -- WE WERE

2492
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
COMPLETELY BARRICADED IN.

2493
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
>> DID YOU TELL THEM TO BE

2494
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
QUIET?

2495
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
>> OH, YEAH.
>> DID YOU WORRY ABOUT --

2496
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
>> -- I TOLD THEM TO BE QUIET.

2497
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
I TOLD THEM WE HAD TO BE

2498
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
ABSOLUTELY QUIET.

2499
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I WAS JUST SO AFRAID THAT IF

2500
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
HE DID COME IN AND HE WOULD

2501
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
HEAR US AND HE WOULD MAYBE

2502
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
START SHOOTING THE DOOR I SAID

2503
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:54,000
NO, WE HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTELY

2504
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
QUIET I SAID THERE ARE BAD

2505
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
GUYS OUT THERE NOW.

2506
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
WE NEED TO WAIT FOR THE GOOD

2507
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,000
GUYS.
I JUST WANTED US TO BE OKAY.

2508
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
AND I'M SO, SO SADDENED THAT

2509
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO, IN THIS

2510
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:10,000
SITUATION, ARE NOT OKAY.

2511
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
MY HEART GOES OUT TO ANYONE

2512
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,000
WHO KNEW THEM ALGD AND PASS

01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
PART OF THEIR LIVES I CAN'T

01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
IMAGINE.
>> SHE HAD 14 KIDS INSIDE THAT

2515
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
RESTROOM.
SHE SAT THERE, ANY KID QUIET

HOLD HIS FACE OR HER FACE

2517
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000

ROSE BARRICADED HER KIDS IN A

CLASSROOM.

2521
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
THEY HID IN A CLOSET THEY

2522
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
STAYED THERE.
THE GUNMAN BANGED ON THE DOOR

2523
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
SAYING LET ME IN.

2524
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
SHE DID NOT.

2525
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,000
SHE WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT HER

2526
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
ACTION, HERO.

2527
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
CAN'T I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU

2528
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
ACTED THAT WAY.

2529
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT

2530
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHERE WE

2531
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
GO FROM HERE AND HOW WE HELP

2532
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000

LITTLE BIT MORE TO THE STORY

2535
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
POLICE FOUND THEM POLICE, I

2536
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
YOU NEED TO PUT YOUR SLIDE

2537
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
YOUR IDS UNDER.

2538

POSSIBLY AUTISM AS WELL.

01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,000
ABOUT SOMETHING WE CALL A

2717
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
SKITS ZIP CODE OR A SKITS OWE

2718
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
TYPE PERSONALITY DISORDER.

2719
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THESE

2720
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
PARTICULAR DISORDERS, PEOPLE

2721
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,000
ISOLATE THEMSELVES, THEY HAVE

2722
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
A BIT OF A DIFFERENT REALITY.

2723
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,000
THEY DON'T HAVE MANY SOCIAL OR

2724
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
INTERACTIONAL SKILLS.

2725
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
>> Brian: SEEMS WENT THROUGH

2726
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
HIGH SCHOOL.
>> FROM WHAT WE HEAR AND THEY

2727
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
HAVE THEIR OWN REALITY.

2728
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,000
WE ARE NOT SAYING THAT THEY

2729
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
ARE SCHIZOPHRENIC.

2730
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
THEY DON'T HAVE HALLUCINATIONS

2731
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
BUT THEY CERTAINLY LIVE IN A

2732
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,000
DIFFERENT WORLD THAN OURS.

2733
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
>> OUR WORLD HAS CHANGED OVER

2734
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
THE LAST 20, 30 YEARS.

2735
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
THE CULTURE HAS CHANGED.

2736
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I WAS TALKING A LITTLE BIT

2737
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
ABOUT APPARENTLY THIS GUY WAS

2738
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
AN EXPERT GAMER.

2739
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:40,000
>> YEAH.

2740
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
>> Steve: MAYBE THE RATING
SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE CHANGED

2741
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
WITH REGARD TO VIDEO GAMES.

2742
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,000
HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN DEADLY

2743
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,000
ACCURATE.

2744
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
>> HE MIGHT HAVE LEARNED HOW

2745
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
TO DO THAT ON THOSE GAMING

2746
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
SYSTEMS.

2747
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
AND THAT MAY HAVE LED INTO AND

2748
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
SUPPORTED A LOT OF THE

2749
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:57,000
DELUSIONAL THINKING.
THIS WAS A VERY DISTURBED

2750
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
INDIVIDUAL.
DELUSIONAL THINKING THAT HE

2751
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,000
MAY HAVE HAD.

2752
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,000
IN SOME WAYS I THINK WE ALL

2753
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY,

2754
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
PERHAPS NOT LETTING OUR KIDS

2755
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
PLAY A LOT OF THOSE GAMES,

2756
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE SOME

2757
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,000
EMOTIONAL ISSUES.

2758
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WE

2759
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,000
KEEP AWAY FROM THOSE VIOLENT

2760
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
GAMES.
>> Brian: HE HAS GOT NO

2761
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
FRIENDS.
HE IS PAINFULLY SHY.

2762
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
DOESN'T WANT TO INTERACT YET

2763
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:20,000
HE HAS THIS GENIUS SIDE TO

2764
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
HIM.

2765
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
PEOPLE CALL HIM EVIL GENIUS OR

2766
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
VERY BRIGHT.

2767
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GO

2768
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,000
THESE GAMES WHERE YOU LOSE

2769
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
YOURSELF.

2770
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
HOW DO YOU STOP IT?
>> VERY DIFFICULT TO STOP IT.

2771
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
IT COMES BACK TO THE

2772
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
RESPONSIBILITY.
BUT HERE'S THE BANE OF THE

2773
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
EXISTENCE OF MANY PARENTS.

2774
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
IF THE KIDS HAVE SOME OF THESE

2775
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,000
VERY SEVERE EMOTIONAL

2776
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
DISORDERS AS THOSE KIDS GET

2777
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
OLDER THEY BECOME A LOT MORE

2778
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
UNCONTROLLABLE.

2779
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,000
AND IT REALLY IS ABOUT GETTING

2780
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
THEM, PERHAPS, TO STAY ON

2781
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
MEDICATION OR TO BE DIAGNOSED.

2782
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
SO IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE

2783
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,000
KIDS.
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE PARENTS

2784
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
AND WE NEED TO STEP UP OUR

2785
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM TO ASSIST

2786
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
THOSE PARENTS IN CONTROLLING

2787
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
AND WORKING.

2788
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
>> Alisyn: SOMEBODY DOESN'T

2789
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
WANT TO TAKE THEIR MEDICATION,
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO

2790
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
THAT?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE IS

2791
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,000
INVOLUNTARY MEDICATION, BUT,

2792
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
AGAIN, YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THE

2793
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,000
RIGHTS OF THE PATIENTS AND

2794
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE MAY HAVE

2795
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
A SCHIZOPHRENIA OR PERHAPS A

2796
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
PERSONALITY DISORDER WHICH WE

2797
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
REALLY DON'T MEDICATE, YOU

2798
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,000
CAN'T REALLY FORCE THEM

2799
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO RESPECT

2800
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
THEIR RIGHTS.

2801
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
THAT'S THE CONUNDRUM.

2802
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,000
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE REALLY ALL

2803
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
STUCK.

2804
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
>> Steve: IT IS TOUGH.
WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD IMAGE OF

2805
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THAT

2806
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
HOUSE UP IN NEWTOWN IN THAT

2807
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
CONNECTICUT.

2808
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE
CULTURE HAS HARDENED PERHAPS

2809
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,000
IT NEEDS TO CHANGE TO A

2810
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,000
SIMPLER, MORE WHOLESOME TIME

2811
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
PATIENTS NEED TO DO THEIR JOB.

2812
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
THEY NEED TO PARENT.

2813
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
>> AS MUCH AS THEY CAN.

2814
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
THEY NEED TO REACH OUT TO

2815
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
OTHER PARENTS, ESPECIALLY WHEN

2816
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
IT BECOMES DIFFICULT FOR THEM.

2817
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
>> Brian: I JUST THINK THIS

2818
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
GUYS IS NUTS.

2819
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
LIKE THE GUY IN AURORA.

2820
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
TO ME THAT ISN'T HANDS ON

2821
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
PARENTING.
I DON'T KNOW IF ANY PARENT CAN

2822
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
REIGN IN THAT TYPE OF MENTAL

2823
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,000
CONDITION.

2824
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
>> THAT IS THE MAJOR ISSUE,

2825
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
LOOK.
PEOPLE DO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH

2826
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,000
ISSUES, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

2827
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
THEY BECOME VIOLENT.

2828
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO WORK

2829
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
WITH THEM TO BE COMPLIANT ON

2830
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
THEIR MEDICATIONS TO BE ABLE

2831
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,000
TO GO TO THE THERAPY.

2832
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
IT'S DIFFICULT THE WAY THE

2833
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IS SET UP

2834
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
RIGHT NOW, IT JUST DOES NOT

2835
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
REACH OUT TO ENOUGH PEOPLE.

2836
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
AND AS A PSYCHOLOGIST.

2837
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:20,000
I HAVE TO STEP UP MY GAME AND

2838
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
HELP PARENTS IN DEALING WITH

2839
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
THESE VERY DIFFICULT

2840
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
SITUATIONS.
>> THIS WHAT S. WHAT WE ALL

2841
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
NEED TO DOES A SOCIETY.

2842
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,000
>> Steve: VERY DIFFICULT

2843
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,000
SITUATION.

01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:02,000
BECAUSE THIS MAY BE IMPORTANT

2896
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,000
LATER ON IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT

2897
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
HAPPENED.

2898
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
>> Alisyn: I KNOW THIS IS YOUR

2899
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,000
LIVELIHOOD AND SO I HESITATE

2900
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
TO SOMEHOW DENIGRATE IT BUT WE

2901
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

2902
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
THERE WON'T BE A TRIAL.

2903
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
THERE IS NO TRIAL.

2904
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
WHY PUT THE PARENTS THROUGH

2905
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
ALL OF THESE FORENSICS?

2906
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
>> TWO THINGS, NUMBER ONE,

2907
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
THERE WON'T BE A TRIAL ON THE

2908
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,000
ADAM.

2909
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF

2910
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,000
CIVIL TRIALS ON THIS.

2911
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
THERE WILL BE CIVIL TRIALS

2912
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
ABOUT THE SCHOOL, ABOUT

2913
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
MEDICATION, ABOUT SECURITY.

2914
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
AND THERE MAY BE A POLICE

2915
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:38,000
INVESTIGATION IF THERE IS
ANOTHER PERSON WHO HELPED ADAM

2916
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
DO THIS BECAUSE, REMEMBER,

2917
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
THIS TOOK A WHILE TO GET

2918
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
TOGETHER FOR HIM TO DO.

2919
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
THERE MAY BE A CRIMINAL CHARGE

2920
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
AGAINST SOMEBODY.
SO THE POLICE WANT TO GET

2921
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
EVERYTHING RIGHT.

2922
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
NOW, FORTUNATELY, THEY HAVE AN

2923
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
EXCELLENT FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST

2924
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
IN CHARGE IN THE STATE OF

2925
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,000
CONNECTICUT WANE CARVER.

2926
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
HE WILL DO EVERYTHING HE CAN

2927
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,000
TO GET THE BABIES BACK TO THE

2928
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,000
FAMILIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

2929
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
BUT NOT ONLY DO THE

2930
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
PHOTOGRAPHS ON IDENTIFICATION

2931
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
HAVE TO BE DONE RIGHT.

2932
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
X-RAYS, SEE IF THERE IS ANY

2933
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
BULLS IN THE BODIES.

2934
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
BULLETS IN THE BODIES.

2935
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
>> Alisyn: YOU HAVE TO DO THAT

2936
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
AGAIN, I HATE THE IDEA OF

2937
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
PUTTING THE PARENTS THROUGH

2938
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
ANY MORTAR TEMPERATURE YOU

2939
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
MUST DO THAT BECAUSE THAT WILL

2940
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
TELL YOU IF HE HAD HELP

2941
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
SOMEHOW OR IF THIS WAS AN ACT

2942
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
ALONE.

2943
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
>> IT WILL TELL IF YOU THERE

2944
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
IS A FOURTH GUN INVOLVED.

2945
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
THE BULLET THAT THE MEDICAL

2946
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
EXAMINER LEAVES BEHIND IS THE

2947
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,000
BULLET THAT MAY HAVE COME FROM

2948
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,000
ANOTHER GUN.

2949
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
SO IT IF THEY HAVE BULLETS

2950
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
FROM SAY THREE GUNS THAT ADAM

2951
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
HAD, MAYBE THERE IS A 40

2952
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
BULLET FROM ANOTHER GUN THERE

2953
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
WAS A QUESTION IN THE

2954
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
BEGINNING AS TO WHETHER THERE

2955
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
WAS A FOURTH SHOOTER.

2956
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
>> A SECOND SHOOTER.

2957
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
>> EXCUSE ME A SECOND SHOOTER

2958
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
A YEAR OR TWO FROM NOW WHEN

2959
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
THIS MAY COME TO COURT THOSE

2960
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
ISSUES WILL BE RAISED AGAIN.

2961
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
>> Alisyn: YOU MAKE A GREAT

2962
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
POINT.
WHEN WILL THE PARENTS BE ABLE

2963
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
TO GET THEIR LOVED ONES?

2964
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
>> I WILL SUSPECT THEY WILL

2965
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
START GETTING THEM FROM THE

2966
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,000
MEDICAL EXAMINERS BECAUSE THE

2967
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,000
FARMINGTON, MEDICAL EXAMINER'S

2968
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
OFFICE HOPEFULLY BY SUNDAY,

2969
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
MONDAY, TUESDAY.

2970
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
THERE WILL BE BODIES STILL

2971
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
THERE MONDAY.

2972
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
ALSO THEY HAVE GOT TO DO A

2973
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:11,000
THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE

2974
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
SHOOTER.
NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF DEATH.

2975
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
WHAT DRUGS WAS HE ON?

2976
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
A DRUG OF ABUSE?

2977
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
HAD HE SEEN A PSYCHIATRIST AND

2978
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:23,000
WAS HE ON ANY THERAPEUTIC

2979
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
DRUGS.
>> Alisyn: TOXICOLOGY REPORTS

2980
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
FOR THE SHOOTER IS VERY

2981
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
IMPORTANT.
>> VERY IMPORTANT.

2982
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
>> Alisyn: THERE IS A PRESS
CONFERENCE EXPECTED AT ANY

2983
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,000
MOMENT AND WE WILL BRING IT TO

2984
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
YOU AS SOON AS IT HAPPENS.

2985
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:37,000
STUDENT, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

2986
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
>>  GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE, WE

2987
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,000
ARE AWAITING A LIVE PRESS

2988
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
CONFERENCE OUT OF NEWTOWN,

2989
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
CONNECTICUT WHERE WE EXPECT TO

2990
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
LEARN NEW DETAILS ABOUT THE

2991
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,000
VICTIMS OF THIS HORRIBLE

2992
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
TRAGEDY AND ABOUT THE SHOOTER

2993
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,000
WHO TOOK THE LIVES OF 26

2994
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
PEOPLE, INCLUDING 20 CHILDREN.

2995
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,000
>> Brian: WE WILL GO TO THAT

2996
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
PRESSER AS SOON AS IT STARTS

2997
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
AND YOU CAN TOTALLY UNDERSTAND

2998
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
IT, BUT EVERYBODY HAS BEEN

2999
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,000
RUNNING BEHIND AND LAST NIGHT

3000
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
EVERY PRESS CONFERENCE RAN

3001
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
BEHIND AND VERY BRIEF AND THE

3002
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
FACTS WERE SKETCHY WHICH

3003
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
REALLY EXPLAINS WHY IF YOU GO

3004
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
TO THE HARTFORD CURRENT OR THE

3005
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:24,000
LOCAL PATCH PAPER AND TALK TO

3006
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,000
GO A REPORTER AND TALK TO THE

3007
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,000
NEW YORK TIMES OR THE NEW YORK

3008
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,000
POST OR DAILY NEWS, A LOT OF

3009
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,000
THE FACTS ARE STILL FLUID, SO

3010
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
TO SPEAK, AND A LOT OF THINGS

3011
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
THAT MATTER A LOT ARE STILL

3012
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,000
UNCLEAR.
THAT'S WHY THIS PRESS

3013
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
CONFERENCE, I IMAGINE, WILL

3014
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
CLEAR A LOT UP.

3015
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:45,000
>> Steve: I HOPE SO, WE'RE 23

3016
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
HOURS AFTER ONE OF THE WORST

3017
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
MASS MURDERS IN AMERICAN

3018
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
HISTORY AND THE SHOOTING AT

3019
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:56,000
VIRGINIA TECH WHERE 32 DIED.

3020
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
IT'S TOO EARLY.

3021
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,000
WE'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW WHAT

3022
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,000
THE MOTIVE IS.

3023
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHY 20-YEAR-OLD

3024
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,000
ADAM LANZA MURDERED HIS MOM

3025
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
AND DROVE HIS CAR TO THE WHERE

3026
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
SHE WORKED.

3027
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
AND THERE'S ONE OTHER THING

3028
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
ABOUT YESTERDAY, I HAVEN'T

3029
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,000
HEARD ANYBODY TALK ABOUT AND

3030
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,000
YOU KIND OF TOUCHED ON IT A

3031
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,000
LITTLE BIT, ALI.

3032
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
YESTERDAY, SCHOOL PRAYER

3033
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,000
RETURNED TO SANDY HOOK BECAUSE

3034
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
A NUMBER OF REEFERS HEARD THE

3035
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:32,000
COMMOTION AND LOCKED THEIR

3036
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,000
KIDS IN CLOSETS AND CORNERS,

3037
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,000
WHAT ELSE DID THEY DO, THEY

3038
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
PRAYED.
>> Alisyn: AND WHAT ELSE CAN

3039
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,000
YOU DO.

3040
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
AND NEW PICTURE EMERGES FROM

3041
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,000
ADDS DAM LANZA, HE WAS 20

3042
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
YEARS OLD.

3043
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
PARENTS DIVORCED IN 2008 OR

3044
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,000
2009 AND LIVED WITH HIS MOM

3045
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
WHO HE LATER KILLED IN

3046
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, GUNS

3047
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
FOUND AT THE SCENE WERE

3048
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
REGISTERED TO HIS MOM, THERE

3049
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
WERE THREE GUNS AND BROTHER

3050
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
RYAN DESCRIBED HIS BROTHER AS

3051
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
BASICALLY A COMPUTER NERD, A

3052
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
TECHNO GEEK.

3053
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
OTHER PEOPLE DESCRIBED HIM AS

3054
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
REMOTE.
THE BROTHER ALSO SAID THAT HE

3055
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
THOUGHT HIS BROTHER MIGHT HAVE

3056
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:10,000
HAD ASPERGER'S SYNDROME AND A

3057
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,000
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

3058
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,000
>> Brian: AS WE DID FIND OUT

3059
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,000
AND ASPERGER'S BARELY IS THERE

3060
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:16,000
VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH IT,

3061
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW SOME TYPE

3062
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
OF ADVERSE MEDICATION.

3063
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
IF THEY ARE HIS MOM'S GUNS AND

3064
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
ONE OF THE GUNS, ONE OF THE

3065
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
WEAPONS WAS TO BE IN THE CAR,

3066
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
THANKFULLY NOT USED WAS A

3067
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
RIFLE THEY SAY IS USED FOR BIG

3068
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,000
GAME HUNTING.

3069
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:37,000
I QUESTION HOW EXTE--

3070
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
HE WENT TO THE CLASSROOMS,

3071
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:48,000
HARTFORD CURRENT, THERE WERE

3072
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
TWO DIFFERENT CLASSROOMS,
WE'VE HEARD DIFFERING REPORTS

3073
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
WAS THE MOM A TEACHER, AN

3074
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
AIDE, DID SHE STEP ASIDE TO

3075
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
TRY TO SOLVE SOME OF HER SON'S

3076
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
PROBLEMS AT 20 YEARS OLD.

3077
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:03,000
>> Steve: WE DID HEAR THE

3078
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
LIEUTENANT EARLIER ON ANOTHER

3079
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,000
CHANNEL, I'M SURE WE'LL HEAR

3080
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
MORE.
THE NEW YORK TIMES IS

3081
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
REPORTING THAT THEY STALLED

3082
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
THIS NEW SECURITY SYSTEM AT

3083
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
THE SCHOOL WHEN SOMEBODY CAME

3084
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,000
TO THE DOOR, ONLY ONE DOOR TO

3085
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,000
ENTER AFTER SCHOOL STARTED

3086
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
9:30.

3087
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
AND WE LEARNED THAT THE KID

3088
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
DIDN'T BUZZ THE DOOR, HE

3089
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
BUSTED THE GLASS AND CAME IN,

3090
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
THERE WAS A STORY THAT THE

3091
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:34,000
PRINCIPAL HAD BUZZED HIM IN.

3092
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
THAT APPARENTLY IS NOT TRUE.

3093
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
THE PRINCIPAL WAS IN A THREE

3094
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
ON ONE MEETING, THE PRINCIPAL,

3095
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000

CHILDREN AND HEARD COMMOTION

3099
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
AND THE PRINCIPAL WENT OUT,

3100
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,000
REALIZED THIS KID WAS SHOOTING

3101
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
AT PEOPLE, TOLD SOME OF THE

3102
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
PEOPLE TO BACK UP.

3103
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:55,000
YELLED LOCK YOUR DOORS AND SHE

3104
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,000
WAS DEAD WITHIN TEN SECONDS.

3105
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,000

CURRENT OF A PRINCIPAL WALKING

3107
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
TO A GUNMAN, RATHER THAN

3108
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
RUNNING AWAY, CONFRONTING,

3109
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
CONFRONTING ALONG WITH THE

02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:17,000
LOSE THEIR LIVES AND VICE

02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
TO RECOVER WITH THE ARM AND

3117
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
LEGS.
AND THE ADMINISTRATION WAS

3118
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,000
DOING THE BEST TO BLOCK AND

3119
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
PROTECT.

3120
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
>> Alisyn: THERE ARE WONDERFUL

3121
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
THINGS COMING OUT ABOUT THE

VERY ACTIVE TWITTER FEED AND

3126
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,000
SHE WOULD TWEET OUT MESSAGES

3127
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,000
ALL THE TIME AND ON THE
OPENING DAY THIS YEAR,

3128
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
SEPTEMBER THE FIRST DAY OF

3129
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000

02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,000
LOVE OF LEARNING AND A COUPLE

3134
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
WELL.

3135
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
HE REPORTEDLY WAS AN HONOR

3136
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:56,000

3137
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000

PERSONALITY DISORDER SET IN.

3141

NO CRIMINAL HISTORY.

3142
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,000
WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS

3143
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
HAPPENS, EVERYONE LOOKS FOR

3144
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,000
WHAT WERE THE WARNING SIGNS

3145
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,000
HOW COULD WE HAVE EVER STOPPED

3146
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
THIS.

3147
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY VIOLENT

3148
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:16,000
BEHAVIOR BEFORE THAT AND
YOU'RE JUST A STRANGE, REMOTE

COMPUTER GEEK, WHAT ARE YOU --

3150
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,000
HOW CAN YOU EVER STOP IT?

3151
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,000
NEIGHBORS DESCRIBED HIM AS A

3152
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:26,000
LITTLE ODD AND PERHAPS A

3153
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,000
COMPULSIVE--

3154
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:28,000
>> THEY WANT TO CONNECT THE

3155
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,000
DOTS AND WE SHOULD HAVE

3156
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,000
REALIZED WHEN HE DID THIS.

3157
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
LOOK, SOMETHING HAPPENED.

3158
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
HE WAS EVIL YESTERDAY AND HE

3159
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
KILLED A WHOLE BUNCH OF

3160
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,000
PEOPLE.

3161
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000

3162
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:44,000

02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
HAPPENING, BUT ROT IN HELL.

3165
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,000
NEIGHBORS WERE TOTALLY FREAKED

3166
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,000
OUT BY THIS GUY.

3167
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,000
>> Steve: I SAW THAT SAME

3168
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
QUOTATION, BUT THERE ARE A LOT

3169
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
OF ROTTEN PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:59,000
EVIL INCARNATE AND WHO DO NOT

3171
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
COMMIT MURDER.

3172
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
AND A SCHOOL CUSTODIAN, HEARD

3173
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,000
GUNSHOTS AND RAN UP AND DOWN

3174
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
THE HALLS AND ALERTED

3175
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
TEACHERS, LOCK YOUR DOORS.

3176
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
THERE WAS A SCHOOL NURSE WHO

3177
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
HEARD THE COMMOTION AND HER

3178
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
INCLINATION WAS TO RUN INTO

3179
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
THE HALL TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S

3180
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
GOING ON, BUT INSTEAD SHE

3181
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
REMEMBERED THE PROTOCOL THEY

3182
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,000
TALKED ABOUT WHEN THEY WERE IN

3183
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
A LOCKDOWN AS THEY WERE

3184
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,000
APPARENTLY YESTERDAY AND HID

3185
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
UNDER THE DESK AND THE DESK,

3186
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
SHE LOOKED UNDER THE, YOU

3187
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,000
KNOW, THE SKIRT OF THE DESK

3188
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
AND SHE SAW THE GUNMAN'S FEET.

3189
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:36,000
HE WAS RIGHT AT HER DESK.

3190
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:39,000
SHE REMAINED COMPLETELY QUIET

3191
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
AND HE TOOK OFF AND STARTED

3192
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,000
SHOOTING AGAIN.

3193
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
>> Brian: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

3194
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,000
MUSIC TEACHER.

3195
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,000
>> Alisyn: LET'S DO THAT.

3196
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,000
OBVIOUSLY IT'S THE CHRISTMAS
SEASON AND JUST THE NIGHT

3197
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:50,000
BEFORE THIS TRAGEDY, THE MUSIC

3198
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:53,000
TEACHER AT THIS SCHOOL SANDY

HER STUDENTS IN A HOLIDAY

3201
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
CONCERT.

3202
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I WISH, I THINK, I DON'T KNOW

3203
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
IF WE HAVE IT RIGHT NOW.

3204
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
THERE'S SOUND FOR THAT AND

3205
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
SPECIAL THAT IS AND LET'S

3206
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:08,000
WATCH THAT FOR ONE SECOND.

3207
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
.
>> MY MUSIC TEACHER TOLD US TO

3208
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,000
GET INTO THE CLOSET.

3209
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:14,000
AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS

3210
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:17,000
JUST A PRACTICE, BUT THEN I

3211
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
REALIZED THAT EVERYTHING WAS

3212
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,000
REAL AND WE WERE ALL IN THE

3213
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,000
CLOSET AND WE WERE SAYING A

3214
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
PRAYER.

3215
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
>> Alisyn: SO THAT'S THAT
STUDENT RESPOND TO GO WHAT THE

3216
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,000
TEACHER DID.

3217
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
THE TEACHER WAS ALSO--

3218
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
HAD HER WITS ABOUT HER AND PUT

3219
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
THEM IN THE CLOSET EVEN AS THE

3220
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
GUNMAN WAS APPARENTLY POUNDING

3221
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:36,000
ON THE DOOR AND SAYING LET ME

3222
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
IN.

3223
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
>> Brian: A SCARY THING.

3224
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,000
>> Steve: SO SHE LOCKED THE

3225
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:43,000
DOOR FROM THE INZOO I HAD

3226
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,000
WHIHAD--

3227
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:48,000
FROM THE INSIDE WHICH WAS THE

3228
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,000
KEY.
AND THE GUNMAN WAS KNOCKING ON

3229
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
THE DOOR SAYING LET ME IN.

3230
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
>> Brian: YOU WANT TO HEAR

3231
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
SOME OF THE CONCERT.

3232
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
THIS IS BEFORE IT TOOK PLACE,

3233
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
BACK THE NIGHT BEFORE.

3234
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,000
OH, WE DON'T?

3235
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,000
OKAY, I THOUGHT WE DID, MY

3236
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
FAULT.
SO, HEARD THE STUDENT IN THE

3237
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
CLASS TALK ABOUT THAT.

3238
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
WHEN THEY WENT UP TO THE MUSIC

3239
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,000
TEACHER AND HEARD THE ACCOUNT

3240
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,000
OF WHAT YOU DID.

3241
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
SHE SAYS I DON'T WANT TO TALK

3242
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
ABOUT WHAT I DID, I WANT TO

3243
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
TALK ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THE

3244
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO LOST

3245
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
THEIR LIVES AND KIDS WHAT

3246
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,000
THEY'VE GONE THROUGH.

3247
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,000
>> Alisyn: THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT BOY, THAT

3248
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:20,000
PARTICULAR LITTLE BOY WHO WE

3249
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
HEARD JUST SPEAK THAT'S

3250
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
PARTICULARLY POIGNANT.

3251
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
AND I THINK YOU FORGET HOW

3252
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,000
LITTLE THOSE BOYS ARE UNTIL

3253
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
YOU HEAR THEIR VOICES.

3254
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,000
AND THAT BOY'S VOICE AS HE'S

3255
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:37,000
ABLE TO RECOUNT THAT TERROR IN

3256
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,000
HIS LITTLE BOY VOICE AND THERE

3257
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
WERE KINDERGARTEN,IN THIS

3258
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,000
CLASS WHO HAD TO DEAL WITH

3259
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
THIS, THIS TERROR AND ALL OF

3260
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:45,000
THESE KIDS IN THE SCHOOL, AS

3261
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID YESTERDAY,

3262
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,000
THESE WERE LITTLE BEAUTIFUL

3263
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
KIDS FROM FIVE TO TEN YEARS

3264
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
OLD AND YOU SPOKE TO THE MOM

3265
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,000
FROM COLUMBINE WHO ALSO IS SO

3266
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
PROFOUND IN EVERYTHING SHE

3267
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
SAYS AND SO POIGNANT AND TALKS

3268
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,000
ABOUT HOW THIS WILL BE WITH

3269
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
THEM, LIKE HER SON, FOR LIFE,

3270
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
BUT HOPEFULLY THEY WILL GET

3271
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
THE HELP THAT THEY NEED TO

3272
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,000
MOVE ON FROM THIS.

3273
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,000
>> Steve: RIGHT.

3274
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
WHAT SHE SAID WAS AFTERWARDS

3275
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY DAZED AND

3276
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:16,000
ANGRY AT KLEBOLD AND HARRIS.

3277
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
AND SHE REGARDED THAT AS EVIL

3278
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
ON EARTH AND BLAMED THEM AND

3279
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
TOOK A WHILE AND EVENTUALLY

3280
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
CAME TO--
TO RECOGNIZE HER DAUGHTER WAS

3281
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
GONE, HER SON HAD WITNESSED

3282
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:31,000
IT.
HE WAS SUFFERING FROM

3283
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,000
TRAUMATIC STRESS SYNDROME,

3284
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,000
STILL DOES.

3285
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
BUT YOU KNOW, SHE SAYS THAT

3286
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
THESE PARENTS OF THESE

3287
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
CHILDREN WHO WERE KILLED

3288
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,000
YESTERDAY, IT'S GOING TO BE A

3289
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
LONG ROAD FOR THEM AND THEY'RE

3290
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000
THE NOT GOING TO KNOW WHAT HIT

3291
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
THEM FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

3292
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,000
>> Brian: AND WE UNDERSTAND

3293
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
ACCORDING TO THE HARTFORD

3294
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
CURRENT, TWO CLASSROOMS, AND

3295
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
WE'VE HEARD REPORTS

3296
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS AND

3297
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,000
HOPEFULLY GET IT CLEARED UP

3298
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:53,000
TODAY.

3299
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
ONE OF THE FIRST GRADE

3300
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,000
TEACHERS HEARD THE SHOOTING

3301
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
AND HAD TO SPRING INTO ACTION.

3302
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:01,000
WHAT WOULD KAITLIN HOYT DO

3303
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
WHEN SHE HAD THE KIDS IN THE

3304
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
CLASSROOM AND HEARD THE

3305
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
SHOOTING.
AND DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS

3306
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
HAPPENING, BUT IN THAT GRADE.

3307
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
THERE WAS A BATHROOM IN THE

3308
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
ACTUAL CLASSROOM AND ASKED ALL

3309
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
HER KIDS TO GET IN THERE.

3310
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
SO CROWDED THEY HAD TO STAND

3311
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,000
ON TOP OF THE TOILETS AND SOME

3312
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:16,000
OF THEM WOULD MAKE NOISE AND

3313
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
SOME WOULD SIT THERE IN HORROR

3314
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
AND SOME THOUGHT IT WAS A GAME

3315
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
AND SHE KNEW IT WAS ESSENTIAL

3316
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
THEY STAY QUIET AND HERE IS

3317
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
THAT TEACHER TALKING ABOUT

3318
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:25,000
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY AT

3319
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
1Y9D 30 IN THE MORNING.

3320
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:30,000
>> I PUT ONE OF MY STUDENTS ON

3321
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,000
TOP OF THE TOILETS.

3322
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
I KNEW WE HAD TO GET IN THERE

3323
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
AND TELLING THEM IT'S GOING TO

3324
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,000
BE OKAY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE

3325
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,000
ALL RIGHT.

3326
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,000
AND I PULLED THE BOOK SHELF

3327
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
BEFORE I CLOSED THE DOOR IN

3328
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:42,000
FRONT OF IT SO WE WERE

3329
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
COMPLETELY BARRICADED IN.

3330
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
>> DID YOU TELL THEM TO BE

3331
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,000
QUIET.
>> YEAH.

3332
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:47,000
>> DID YOU WORRY--

3333
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
>> I TOLD THEM TO BE QUIET.

3334
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,000
WE HAD TO BE ABSOLUTELY QUIET

3335
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,000
I WAS AFRAID IF HE DID COME IN

3336
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,000
AND HEAR US HE WOULD MAYBE

3337
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
START SHOOTING THE DOOR, NO,

3338
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
WE HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTELY QUIET

3339
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:02,000
AND I SAID WE'RE WAITING FOR

3340
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:07,000
THE GOOD GUYS AND I JUST, I

3341
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
WANTED US TO BE OKAY SO

3342
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,000
SADDENED THAT THERE WERE

3343
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,000
PEOPLE IN THE SITUATION WHO

3344
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,000
ARE NOT OKAY.

3345
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
AND MY HEART, MY HEART GOES

3346
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:21,000
OUT TO ANYONE WHO, PART OF

3347
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
THEIR LIVES.

3348
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
>> Alisyn: THE MOST HEART

3349
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
WRENCHING THING ABOUT WHAT SHE

3350
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:28,000
SAYS THERE, AT LEAST I'M

3351
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
READING IT IN THE TRANSCRIPT

3352
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
OF WHAT HE SHE SAID, WE DIDN'T

3353
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,000
PLAY IS THERE.

3354
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:36,000
SHE WOULD TAKE THEIR HEAD,

3355
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,000
THEIR FACE INS HER HANDS AND

3356
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
TELL THEM IT'S GOING TO BE

3357
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
OKAY, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY,

3358
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
SHE WANTED THAT TO BE THE LAST

3359
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,000
THING THEY HEARD.

3360
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,000
>> Brian: THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

3361
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
FROM PAST RECORDS YOU KNOW HOW

3362
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,000
THE GRADES AND CLOSE, FIRST

3363
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,000
GRADE, SECOND GRADES, THIRD

3364
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
GRADES, AND CURRICULUMS AND

3365
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,000
TWO FIRST GRADE CHARMS THAT

3366
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
WERE MASSACRED AND SHE'S

3367
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
SITTING THERE AND GOT TO LIVE

3368
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
WITH WHAT, WHO IS LEFT AND THE

3369
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
HORROR THAT SHE'S BEEN THROUGH

3370
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,000
AND SHE DEFINES TRAUMATIZED.

3371
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,000
>> Steve: THERE IS ONE OTHER

3372
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
COMPONENT AND WE DON'T KNOW

3373
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
THE BACK STORY BECAUSE

3374
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
SOMEBODY IN THE OFFICE AS THE

3375
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
COMMOTION STARTED YESTERDAY.

3376
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
PUSHED DOWN THE BUTTON ON THE

3377
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM WHERE

3378
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
THEY DO THE FLAG SALUTE AND

3379
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
SOMEBODY PUSHED IT DOWN AND

3380
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
THE ENTIRE BUILDING HEARD AT

3381
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:24,000
LEAST ONE PERSON SCREAMING AND

3382
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,000
IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THERE

3383
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:28,000
WERE GUNSHOTS WERE AUDIBLE OR

3384
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
NOT AND CREDITING WHOEVER DID

3385
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
THAT WITH PERHAPS SAVING LIVES

3386
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
BECAUSE AS SOON AS PEOPLE

3387
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:35,000
HEARD THAT, THE TEACHERS AND

3388
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
OTHER STAFF MEMBERS, THEY LOCK

3389
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
THE DOORS FROM THE INSIDE.

3390
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
AND PERHAPS, YOU KNOW, YOU

3391
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,000
LISTEN TO THE STORY ABOUT THE

3392
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,000
MUSIC TEACHER AND THE GUY IS

3393
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:46,000
BANGING ON THE DOOR, OPEN UP,

3394
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
THE GUY WITH THE THE GUN, HOW

3395
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,000
MANY LIVES WERE SAVED BECAUSE

3396
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
SOMEBODY PUSHED A BUTTON FOR

3397
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,000
TWO SECONDS.

3398
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
>> Brian: RIGHT WEEKS' WAITING
FOR THE PRESS CONFERENCE,

3399
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,000
COULD START ANY SECOND AND

3400
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:56,000
WE'LL GO RIGHT TO IT AND WE'LL

3401
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,000
LEAVE THE SCREEN AND YOU'LL

3402
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:00,000
TAKE IN THAT, YOU'LL SEE THE

3403
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
OFFICER SITTING BEHIND THE

3404
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,000
MICROPHONE AND GETTING THE

3405
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
LATEST AND LET'S CONTINUE TO

3406
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,000
SPECULATE FROM AN EDUCATION

3407
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,000
A-PERSPECTIVE.

3408
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
ROD WHEELER A HOMICIDE

3409
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:12,000
DETECTIVE.
SEES SADLY A LOT OF THESE

3410
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:17,000
CRIME SCENES AND NOTHING, I

3411
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
WOULD ARGUE, AS SAD AS

3412
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
CHILDREN LOSING THEIR LIVES AT

3413
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,000
SCHOOL.

3414
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,000
AND WHAT HAS YOUR SCRATCHING

3415
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:24,000
YOUR HEAD?

3416
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:25,000
>> I THINK THE MAIN THING

3417
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,

3418
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,000
BRIAN, TALKING ALL MORNING

3419
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,000
TOLD.

3420
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,000
WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE

3421
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,000
MOTIVE AND WHAT WAS THE SPARK?

3422
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
AS I INDICATED EARLIER THAT

3423
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,000
IGNITED THIS GUY YESTERDAY.

3424
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
THERE HAD TO BE SOMETHING AND

3425
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,000
SO THAT'S WHAT THE POLICE ARE

3426
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

3427
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:39,000
THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT TO

3428
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
KNOW AND THE OTHER VERY

3429
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:42,000
IMPORTANT QUESTION HERE, WHERE

3430
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,000
DID HE GET THIS AMMUNITION

3431
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,000
FROM?

3432
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,000
AND I KEEP GOING BACK TO THAT

3433
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,000
FOR A REASON.

3434
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
REASON I'M GOING BACK TO THAT

3435
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
HE DIDN'T GET THAT AMMUNITION

3436
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,000
YESTERDAY MORNING, HE HAD TO

3437
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:51,000
HAVE ACCUMULATED THAT OVER A

3438
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:52,000
PERIOD OF TIME.

3439
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
SO, AS A RESULT OF THAT, THE

3440
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,000
QUESTION BECOMES, WAS THIS AS

3441
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,000
PLANNED EVENT AND WHETHER OR

3442
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,000
NOT ANYBODY WAS INVOLVED WITH

3443
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:00,000
THEM.
AND THAT'S STILL SOMETHING

3444
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,000
THAT THE POLICE ARE TRYING TO

3445
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:02,000
FIGURE OUT RIGHT NOW, BRIAN.

3446
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
>> Brian: LET'S THINK ABOUT

3447
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,000
THAT.

3448
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,000
WE KNOW HE HAD PROTECTIVE

3449
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
EQUIPMENT WHETHER IT WAS A

3450
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,000
BULLET-PROOF VEST.

3451
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,000
AND EXCUSE ME?

3452
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,000
>> AND CALMO, TOO.

3453
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS A BLACK

3454
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
OUTFIT, THOUGH, TOO, BUT HE

3455
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
HAD HOLLOWED OUT BULLETS, BUT

3456
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
I'M NOT A BALLISTICS EXPERT,

3457
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
BUT I UNDERSTAND FLOWER AFTER

3458
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
IMPACT INSIDE THE BODY.

3459
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
>> THOSE ARE THE WORST BULLETS

3460
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
YOU CAN HAVE.

3461
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
THEY'RE HOLLOW POINT AND THE

3462
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:32,000
KIND WE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT

3463
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:35,000
HATE, THEY CAN PENETRATE A

3464
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,000
BULLET-PROOF VEST.

3465
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
WHERE DID HE GET THAT

3466
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
AMMUNITION FROM?

3467
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
WAS ANYBODY INVOLVED WITH THIS

3468
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:42,000
GUY?

3469
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,000
OBVIOUSLY THIS WAS A PLANNED

3470
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
EVERETT AND SET OUT, I THINK,

3471
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,000
PROBABLY, DAYS AGO TO COMMIT

3472
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
THIS ACT.

3473
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,000
>> Alisyn: I HAVE A QUESTION.

3474
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NEWTOWN,

3475
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
CONNECTICUT FOR A SECOND AND

3476
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IT'S

3477
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
LIKE.

3478
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:56,000
IT'S THIS VERY PRECIOUS, VERY

3479
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
SWEET, I'VE SPENT TIME THERE,

3480
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:01,000
A BEAUTIFUL TOWN WITH LOVELY

3481
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
TOWN SQUARES AND BEAUTIFUL OLD

3482
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,000
CHURCHES ADORNING DIFFERENT

3483
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,000
CORNERS AND SMALL,

3484
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
PARTICULARLY HAMLET OF SANDY

3485
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:08,000
HOOK.
IS THIS SOMETHING, SOMETHING

3486
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
AS HIDEOUS AS THIS CRIME THAT

3487
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
A SMALL LITTLE TOWN POLICE

3488
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:15,000
DEPARTMENT LIKE THE NEWTOWN

3489
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,000
POLICE OFFICERS, WOULD THEY

3490
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:19,000
EVER HAVE HAD A DRILL TO TRAIN

3491
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,000
FOR A SCHOOL SHOOTING?

3492
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,000
>> YOU KNOW, THAT'S AN

3493
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,000
EXCELLENT QUESTION AND I CAN

3494
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
TELL YOU THE ANSWER IS YES.

3495
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:25,000
WHY?

3496
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:26,000
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK

3497
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
HISTORICALLY, ALISYN, AT A LOT

3498
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
OF THESE TYPE OF SHOOTINGS,

3499
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
THEY HOPE IN REMOTE AREAS, YOU

3500
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE A WHOLE

3501
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,000
LOT OF MASS SHOOTINGSES IN THE

3502
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
INNER CITY AREA THAT YOU EVER

3503
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,000
NOTICE THAT.

3504
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
A LOT OF TIMES THEY HAPPEN IN

3505
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,000
REMOTE AREAS.

3506
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:44,000
LOOK AT COLUMBINE, ALL POLICE

3507
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THIS
COUNTRY REALLY, AS A RESULT OF

3508
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,000
COLUMBINE AND OF COURSE,

3509
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,000
VIRGINIA TECH, ALISYN, WE'VE

3510
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:51,000
BEEN PRACTICING ON THIS AND

3511
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
CONTINUE TO PRACTICE ON THIS

3512
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:54,000
ON A REGULAR BASIS, EVERY

3513
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,000
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

3514
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,000
NOW WHY?

3515
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,000
BECAUSE THESE SITUATIONS CAN

3516
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:58,000
HAPPEN AT ANY TIME AND THAT'S

3517
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
WHY IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT FOR

3518
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,000
ALL OF OUR VIEWERS TO

3519
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,000
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO

3520
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE NOW,

3521
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
ALISYN, IN CASE SOMETHING LIKE

3522
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,000
THIS HAPPENS.

3523
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:10,000
LET'S HOPE IT NEVER HAPPENS

3524
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,000
AGAIN, BUT THE TIME TO PLAN

3525
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,000
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO RESPOND TO

3526
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,000
THIS IS NOW.

3527
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,000
>> AS A DETECTIVE AND YOU TRY

3528
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:15,000
TO PUT THIS CRIME SCENE

3529
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
TOGETHER, PEOPLE SAY CRIMES OF

3530
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,000
PASSION, LOOK FOR THIS.

3531
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:21,000
CRIMES OF HATE, STRANGERS,

3532
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,000
WHATEVER.
WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE

3533
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
SHOOTS HIS MOM AND GOES TO

3534
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
WHAT WE BELIEVE WAS HER WORK

3535
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,000
PLACE.
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT WORK

3536
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
PLACE COULD SYMBOLIZE

3537
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:30,000
SOMETHING THAT HE WANTED TO

3538
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
RECTIFY, TAKE HER OUT AND THEN

3539
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
TAKE OUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT

3540
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
SHE LOVED.
>> THAT SHE LOVED OR WAS

3541
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
COMING BETWEEN HER AND HIM AND

3542
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,000
HIS MOM.

3543
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
>> RIGHT.

3544
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,000
AND THERE HAD TO BE SOMETHING,

3545
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
AS I INDICATED EARLIER, BRIAN,

3546
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:44,000
AND I DON'T LIKE TO SPECULATE,

3547
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
AS YOU GUYS KNOW, TOOUCH IN

3548
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,000
THESE CASES.

3549
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
IT'S VERY EARLY IN THIS CASE,

3550
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I HONESTLY

3551
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,000
BELIEVE?

3552
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:53,000
I THINK THERE HAD TO BE

3553
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,000
SOMETHING GOING ON BETWEEN

3554
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,000
THIS GUY'S MOTHER AND THE

3555
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:59,000
SCHOOL AND TOOK HIS MOTHER OUT

3556
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,000
FIGURED IN HIS MIND HE'S GOING

3557
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
TO GET EVEN WITH THAT SCHOOL,

3558
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:03,000
THAT PRINCIPAL, AGAIN, DON'T

3559
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
WANT TO SPECULATE HERE, THAT

3560
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
DOESN'T DO ANYBODY ANY GOOD,

3561
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
BUT HOWEVER, WE HAVE AN

3562
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
OBLIGATION TO TRY TO PUT THE

3563
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
PIECES TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT

3564
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
WHAT WAS IT TO CAUSE THIS GUY

3565
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
TO SELECT THOSE CLASSROOMS.

3566
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,000
ONE OF THE ACTUAL WITNESSES

3567
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,000
SAID WHEN THIS GUY CAME INTO

3568
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
THE SCHOOL HE SPECIFICALLY

3569
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,000
WENT TO A CERTAIN CLASSROOM.

3570
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,000
WHY DID HE DO THAT?

3571
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
WHY DIDN'T HE JUST START

3572
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:24,000
SHOOTING IN THE HALLWAY?

3573
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
WE DON'T KNOW.

3574
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,000
THAT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT
QUESTION WE'RE TRYING TO

3575
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:30,000
FIGURE OUT HOW, BRIAN.

3576
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:34,000
>> ROD WHEELER, THANKS.
AND STAY CLOSE, WE'LL WAIT FOR

3577
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND THE

3578
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
FACTS THIS MORNING.

3579
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
>> Alisyn: THANKS, MEANWHILE

3580
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,000
WE WANT TO BRING IN MIKE

3581
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
HUCKABEE, GOVERNOR, 1998,

3582
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:44,000
JONESBORO, ARKANSAS.

3583
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
>> YEAH.

3584
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,000
>> Alisyn: THERE WAS A SCHOOL

3585
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:49,000
SHOOTING, AGAIN, YOUNG MEN,

3586
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:50,000
YOUNG BOYS.

3587
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

3588
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
>> I MEAN, I REMEMBER VIVIDLY,

3589
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I'LL NEVER FORGET IT, MARCH

3590
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,000
24TH, 1998 AND WHAT WAS

3591
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:00,000
TRAGIC, A 11-YEAR-OLD AND A

3592
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
12-YEAR-OLD, WHO AMBUSHED

3593
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:03,000
THEIR FELLOW STUDENTS AND

3594
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
TEACHERS, KILLING FIVE,

3595
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
WOUNDING TEN OTHERS, IT WAS A

3596
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,000
HORRIBLE SCENE.

3597
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT NO

3598
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
ONE REALLY EVER PREPARED FOR A

3599
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
11-YEAR-OLD COMMITTING MASS

3600
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
MURDER.
A 11-YEAR-OLD, NOT ENOUGH TO

3601
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
GO EVEN THROUGH PUBERTY, SO

3602
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
THERE WERE NO LAWS IN PLACE

3603
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
THAT SAID YOU CAN KEEP THIS

3604
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
KID FOREVER, YOU ADJUDICATE

3605
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
HIM WHEN HE'S A JUVENILE AND

3606
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
HAVE TO LET HIM GO WHEN HE'S

3607
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
18.
THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT THE

3608
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT

3609
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:37,000
SAYS THIS, AND PEOPLE SAY YOU

3610
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
SHOULD HAVE A LAW AND THERE IS

3611
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:44,000
ONE THOU SHALLT NOT KILL.

3612
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:45,000
>> Brian: THEY'RE NEVER

3613
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
TALKING ABOUT THE CULTURE.

3614
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
>> Steve: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

3615
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
OUR CULTURE AND OUR CULTURE

3616
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:52,000
HAS HARDENED.

3617
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
>> AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT

3618
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,000
IN AN HONEST WAY AND DON'T

3619
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:58,000
MEAN TO BE SIMPLISTIC AND

3620
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
YESTERDAY ON CAVUTO, HE ASKED

3621
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,000
WHERE WAS GOD.

3622
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
WE'VE REMOVED THEM.

3623
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,000
AND SOME SAID IF WE HAVE

3624
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:07,000
PRAYER IN SCHOOLS THIS

3625
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,000
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

3626
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,000
MY POINT IS A LARGER POINT,

3627
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,000
THAT WE HAVE AS A CULTURE

3628
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
DECIDED THAT WE DON'T WANT TO

3629
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
HAVE VALUES, THAT WE DON'T

3630
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:17,000
WANT TO SAY THAT SOME THINGS

3631
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,000
ARE ALWAYS RIGHT AND SOME

3632
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,000
THINGS ARE ALWAYS WRONG.

3633
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
WHEN WE DIVORCE OURSELVES FROM

3634
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,000
A BASIC SENSE OF WHAT WE WOULD

3635
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,000
CALL, I WOULD SAY, COLLECTIVE

3636
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
MORALITY WHERE WE AGREE ON

3637
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
CERTAIN PRINCIPLES TO BE TRUE

3638
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
ALWAYS, THEN WE CREATE A

3639
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:32,000
CULTURE, NOT THAT IT

3640
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:33,000
SPECIFICALLY CREATES THIS

3641
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:36,000
CRIME.
IT DOESN'T, BUT IT CREATES AN

3642
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,000
ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH EVIL AND

3643
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
VIOLENCE ARE REMOVED FROM OUR

3644
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:44,000
SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY.

3645
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:49,000
THE GOVERNOR YESTERDAY SAID

3646
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:52,000
TEVIL VISITED THIS COMMUNITY.

3647
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,000
AND HE SPOKE AS A DAD AND NOT

3648
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:56,000
AS A POLITICIAN, YOU COULD SEE

3649
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
THE EMOTION, HE QUOTED

3650
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,000
SCRIPTURE, WE ALWAYS GO BACK

3651
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:02,000
TO THE CULTURAL NORMS IN THE

3652
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
MOMENTS OF CRISIS AND ACT LIKE

3653
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
WE'RE ASHAMED TESTIFY THE REST

3654
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
OF THE YEAR.

3655
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,000
>> Brian: THE SCHOOL HAD IT IT

3656
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
RIGHT AND THE GOVERNMENT HAD

3657
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,000
IT WRONG.

3658
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:12,000
THAT SCHOOL SEEMED TO BE A

3659
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
HOME RUN IN EVERY WAY AS AN

3660
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
EDUCATIONAL FOUNDER AND THE

3661
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,000
PRINCIPAL DRESSING UP, FUNNY

3662
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
FACES AND GREETING CHILDREN.

3663
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:22,000
MY PRINCIPAL NEVER SAID THREE

3664
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
WORDS.
>> THERE WERE TIMES WE WISHED

3665
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,000
OUR PRINCIPAL WOULD HAVE

3666
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:25,000
DRESSED UP.

3667
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
THAT'S A GREAT POINT, BRIAN.

3668
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:30,000
AN EXEMPLARY SCHOOL AND SOME

3669
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:35,000
WOULD SAY A IDYLLIC COMMUNITY.

3670
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
AND WE ALWAYS SAY THIS IS THE

3671
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
LAST PLACE IT WOULD HAPPEN,

3672
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
NO, IT'S REALLY NOT BECAUSE IT

3673
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE, ANYTIME

3674
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
AND THAT'S WHY WE CAN PASS A

3675
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,000
THOUSAND THOUSANDS AND

3676
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:47,000
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN

3677
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT AT SANDY

3678
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY, IT CAN AND IT

3679
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
UNFORTUNATELY WILL HAPPEN.

3680
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:54,000
>> Alisyn: BUT TO BRIAN'S

3681
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:55,000
POINT.
YOU TALK ABOUT THE CULTURE

3682
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:56,000
SOMEHOW GOING AWRY, BUT I

3683
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

3684
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT THIS IS A

3685
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
TOWN OF -- YOU SEE THE PARENTS

3686
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
RUNNING TO THE SCHOOL.

3687
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
THESE ARE GOOD PARENTS, AND

3688
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL CULTURE AND

3689
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL

3690
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,000
CONNECT TODAY THEIR COMMUNITY,

3691
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
BE IT A CHURCH, BE IT A

3692
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:13,000
SYNAGOGUE.

3693
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
SO, SOMETHING MUST BE GOING

3694
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,000
WRONG WITH YOUNG MEN.

3695
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:19,000
I MEAN, IT'S YOUNG MEN WHO

3696
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,000
PERPETRATE ALL OF THESE SCHOOL

3697
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,000
SHOOTING AND SADLY THEY ARE

3698
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
HE' ON THE RISE.

3699
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,000
THERE'S SOMETHING, I DON'T

3700
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,000
KNOW A SENSE OF ILLNESS?

3701
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DIG DEEP

3702
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,000
TOWER GET TO THE ANSWER, BUT

3703
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S THAT

3704
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:31,000
CULTURE, LOOK AT THAT

3705
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,000
BEAUTIFUL CULTURE.

3706
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:33,000
>> IT'S NOT THE CULTURE OF

3707
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
NEWTOWN, IT'S THE GENERAL

3708
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
CULTURE OF OUR SOCIETY.

3709
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,000
AN EXAMPLE, WHEN I WAS IN

3710
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,000
SCHOOL IT WAS NORMAL THAT WE

3711
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
CARRY GUNS TO SCHOOL, OKAY?

3712
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
IN OUR CARS AND PICKUP TRUCKS,

3713
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
GUNS WERE IN OUR, BECAUSE WE

3714
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:46,000
HUNTED BEFORE SCHOOL, WE

3715
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:47,000
HUNTED AFTER.

3716
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:50,000
LISTEN, IT NEVER OCCURRED--

3717
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,000
>> COULD HAVE GUN RACKS IN OUR

3718
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,000
TRUCKS.

3719
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
>> AND STAYED IN THE SCHOOL

3720
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
PARKING LOT.
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ANY OF US

3721
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
THAT WE WOULD EVER USE THAT

3722
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,000
GUN TO KILL OUR CLASSMATES.

3723
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
THE CULTURE POINT I'M TALKING

3724
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
ABOUT, WE UNDERSTOOD WHAT GUNS

3725
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,000
WERE, WE UNDERSTOOD WE WEREN'T

3726
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
TO USE THEM ON EACH OTHER.

3727
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:07,000
TODAY, YOU HAVE KIDS WHO USE

3728
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
GUNS IN GAMES, THEY HAVE A

3729
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
DISCONNECT FROM REALITY.

3730
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
THE GUNS THEY SEE AND HEAR ARE

3731
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
NOT REAL AND THEY SOMEHOW

3732
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THERE

3733
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:20,000
ARE REAL CONSEQUENCES.

3734
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
>> GO AHEAD.
>> I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY

3735
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
THIS PARTICULAR SHOOTER WHO

3736
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:25,000
SHOT ALL THE PEOPLE WERE

3737
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,000
APPARENTLY AN EXPERT GAMER,

3738
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
AND NEW YORK TIMES THEY TALKED

3739
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,000
A LITTLE ABOUT THAT.

3740
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
YOU MENTIONED A SCHOOL PRAYER,

3741
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
IT RETURNED YESTERDAY.

3742
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
>> YEAH.
>> Steve: A BUNCH OF STORIES

3743
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,000
OF TEACHERS WHO MASSED THEIR

3744
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
KIDS IN CLOSETS AND CORNERS

3745
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
AND WHAT DO THEY DO, WAIT FOR

3746
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,000
THE POLICE.

3747
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
>> AND PRAY.

3748
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:44,000
>> Brian: GOVERNOR, AND BRING

3749
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,000
IN SOMETHING ELSE, THOUSAND

3750
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
SHALL NOT KILL AND WORK A

3751
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
JACKHAMMER DURING A TALK SHOW

3752
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
IN THE BACKGROUND.

3753
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,000
>> Alisyn: I DON'T KNOW IF THE

3754
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:58,000
VIEWERS CAN HEAR IT, IT'S

3755
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:59,000
DEAFENING.
>> LIKE A DENTIST IN THE

3756
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:00,000
MAKEUP ROOM.

3757
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,000
>> Brian: BRINGING BACK BAD

3758
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,000
MEMORIES.

3759
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
GOVERNOR, KEEP IN MIND, TOO,

3760
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
YOU KNOW THIS, EVEN THOUGH

3761
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
THERE'S THE GABBY GIFFORDS

3762
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,000
HORROR AND AT AURORA HORROR

3763
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,000
AND IN THE MALL.

3764
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE

3765
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,000
WALKING IN AND AROUND SHOPPING

3766
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
IN MALLS, NOTHING IS IT

3767
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,000
HAPPENING AND SCHOOLS ARE

3768
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,000
OPENING AND CLOSING, NOTHING

3769
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
IS HAPPENING, THERE'S NO

3770
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,000
THREAT.

3771
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
SECURITY IS WORKING FINE.

3772
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:22,000
WE OBVIOUSLY HIGHLIGHT

3773
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
SOMETHING THAT'S THE SECOND

3774
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,000
WORSE MASSACRE IN THE HISTORY

3775
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,000
OF THE COUNTRY WHEN IT COMES

3776
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
TO SCHOOLS, BUT I ALSO THINK

3777
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:29,000
THAT THE PEOPLE AT HOME ARE

3778
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
WRITING AND SAYING THIS, I

3779
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
DON'T WANT EVERYONE TO GO TO

3780
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:34,000
SCHOOL TOMORROW, ON MONDAY AND

3781
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
THINK TO THEMSELVES ARE WE

3782
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
GOING TO GET SHOT TODAY, IT'S

3783
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,000
NOT REALITY.

3784
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
>> NO, IT'S NOT REALITY.

3785
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:45,000
AND JUST LIKE PLANE CRASHES

3786
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:46,000
AND PEOPLE SAY I'M GOING TO

3787
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:47,000
CANCEL MY NIGHT.

3788
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:51,000
OR A BUS ACCIDENT, OR TRAINS,

3789
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,000
IT'S A NATURAL HUMAN RESPONSE

3790
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
WE WANT TO SURVIVE AND SO WE

3791
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,000
LOOK AT ALL FORMS OF THREAT

3792
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:58,000
AND WE TRY TO ELIMINATE

3793
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,000
BUT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY IS

3794
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
THE KIND OF OUT OF THE BLUE,

3795
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
THAT'S WHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

3796
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:06,000
IT, WHY WE'VE GONE 24/7

3797
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:09,000
TALKLING ABOUT IT, BECAUSE

3798
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,000
IT'S UNUSUAL.

3799
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
THE DAY IT'S NORMAL, OR

3800
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:15,000
ROUTINE, ONE OF THE DOZENS

3801
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:16,000
STORIES COVERED IN THE HALF

3802
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
HOUR.
IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT WE

3803
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:21,000
SHOULD BE SHOCKED WHEN THIS

3804
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
HAPPENED, WHEN I SAY SHOCKED,

3805
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:24,000
YES, IT SHOULD--

3806
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,000
THE DAY IT BECOMES ROUTINE AND

3807
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
DON'T ALL FEEL A GUT-PUNCH,

3808
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
THAT'S WHEN WE NEED TO WORRY.

3809
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:30,000
>> Alisyn: IF HISTORY HAD GONE

3810
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,000
DIFFERENTLY AND IF YOU WERE

3811
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:34,000
PRESIDENT TODAY, WHAT WOULD

3812
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,000
YOU HAVE THE NATIONAL DIALOG

3813
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:36,000
BE TOMORROW ABOUT THIS?

3814
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:37,000
>> I THINK YOU WOULD GRIEVE.

3815
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:38,000
THIS IS NOT A TIME TO HAVE A

3816
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
DIALOG ABOUT WHAT TO DO AND I

3817
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:41,000
THINK THE BIG MISTAKE TODAY

3818
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:44,000
WOULD BE TO HAVE ALL OF THESE

3819
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
POLITICAL OR PHILOSOPHICAL

3820
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,000
DISCUSSIONS HOW DO WE PREVENT

3821
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE TIME.

3822
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
THE TIME NOW IS TO GRIEVE,

3823
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
IT'S TO TO PUT OUR ARMS AROUND

3824
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:54,000
THIS COMMUNITY AND THESE

3825
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:55,000
FAMILIES AND KIDS WHO SAW

3826
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
SOMETHING THEY'LL NEVER EVER

3827
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
GET BEYOND AND TO DO

3828
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GRIEVE.

3829
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:02,000
AND THERE'S A TIME FOR ALL OF

3830
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
THAT, IT'S NOT TODAY AND NOT

3831
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:05,000
THIS WEEKEND.

3832
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:06,000
>> ARE YOU GOING TO BE LIVE
THIS WEEKEND?

3833
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:07,000
>> WE'LL BE LIVE TONIGHT TO DO

3834
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
A SPECIAL SHOW AND WE'LL HAVE

3835
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:10,000

YOU TALK TO YOUR FAMILY,

3840
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,000
PARTICULARLY TO LITTLE KIDS

3841
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
AND EXPLAIN THE GRIEF PROCESS

3842
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
TO THEM WHO MAYBE HAVE NEVER

3843
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,000
BEEN THROUGH IT BEFORE.

3844
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
>> GOOD MORNING AB WE'LL LET

3845
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:29,000

3848
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
LIVE IMAGE OUT OF NEWTOWN,

3849
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
CONNECTICUT WHERE WE WERE TOLD

3850
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,000
THAT THE PRESS CONFERENCE WITH

3851
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:38,000
THE AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE

3852
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,000
STATE POLICE, LOCAL POLICE WAS

3853
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:40,000
GOING TO START AT EIGHT

3854
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,000
O'CLOCK.

3855
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
KEEP IN MIND, INSIDE THAT

3856
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
SCHOOL, IT'S A GIGANTIC CRIME

3857
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:49,000
SCENE WHERE 26 HOMICIDES TOOK

3858
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:50,000
PLACE YESTERDAY.

3859
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:54,000
DR. MICHAEL BODDEN, ESTEEMED

3860
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGIST JOINS US

3861
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:57,000
LIVE NOW HERE.

3862
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN DOING

3863
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,000
OVERNIGHT IN THE SCHOOL.

3864
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
>> OVERNIGHT THE MEDICAL

3865
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,000
EXAMINER HAS BEEN LOOKING AT

3866
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
THE BODIES AND WORKING WITH

3867
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
THE CSI, THE CRIME SCENE

3868
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:10,000
POLICE, DOCUMENTING WHERE EACH

3869
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,000
BODY IS, DOCUMENTS FOR THE

3870
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,000
SHELL CASINGS.

3871
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:13,000
>> WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT?

3872
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
>> WE KNOW WHO DID IT AND WE

3873
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
KNOW HE CAME IN AND HE JUST

3874
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:18,000
STARTED SHOOTING.

3875
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
>> RIGHT, BECAUSE TO DOCUMENT

3876
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
EVERYTHING IS IMPORTANT FOR

3877
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:26,000
FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH HOLLIES

3878
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:29,000
DISCUSSIONS AND ALSO, THE

3879
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:32,000
FUTURES AND JUST BECAUSE THERE

3880
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:33,000
ARE NO CRIMINAL LAWSUITS

3881
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
DOESN'T MEAN A LOT OF CIVIL

3882
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
LAWSUITS WHERE ALL OF THIS IS

3883
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:38,000
IT GOING TO BE IMPORTANT WHERE

3884
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,000
THERE'S ANY DEFICIT IN THE WAY

3885
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:42,000
THE CHILDREN WERE HANDLED,

3886
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:43,000
THEY HAVE TO PHOTOGRAPH THE

3887
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:44,000
SCENE, DIAGRAM THE SCENE, BUT

3888
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:47,000
THEN, AND THAT'S BEEN GOING ON

3889
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
24 HOURS.

3890
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
NOW, THE BODIES WOULD NORMALLY

3891
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:56,000
HAVE TO GO TO FARMINGTON WHERE

3892
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:00,000
THE CONNECTICUT MEDICAL

3893
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:03,000
EXAMINER IS AND X-RAYS TAKEN

3894
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:04,000
AND THE INDIVIDUAL GUNSHOT

3895
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:05,000
WOUNDS WILL BE DOCUMENTED.

3896
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
NOW, IN THE X-RAYS, IF THERE

3897
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:08,000
ARE BULLETS IN THE BODIES

3898
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
BECAUSE SOME OF THE BODIES

3899
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:13,000
WENT THROUGH, THERE'S AN ISSUE

3900
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:17,000
OF AUTOPSIES HAVING TO BE DONE

3901
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
TO DOCUMENT EACH BULLET WITH

3902
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
EACH GUN.

3903
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:22,000
>> Alisyn: AND WHAT DO PARENTS

3904
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
SAY, AND I JUST WANT THE BODY

3905
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
OF MY CHILD RETURNED TO ME.

3906
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
>> THE WISHES, THE MEDICAL

3907
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
EXAMINER'S DETERMINATION.

3908
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:31,000
>> Alisyn: BECAUSE IT'S A

3909
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:32,000
CRIME SCENE, PARENTS DON'T

3910
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
HAVE THE CHOICE.
>> THE PARENTS HAVE A CHOICE

3911
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
TO TELL THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

3912
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
WHAT THEIR OPINION IS.

3913
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER MASS TO

3914
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
SEE WHAT THE RESPONSIBILITY IS

3915
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
AND NORMALLY, THE PARENT

3916
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
DOESN'T WANT THE MEDICAL

3917
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:46,000
EXAMINER TO DO THE AUTOPSY

3918
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
THEY CAN GO TO COURT AND GET A

3919
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:51,000
COURT ORDER, BUT THAT TAKES

3920
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:54,000
DAYS AND DAYS AND THE FAMILIES

3921
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,000
WANT REMAINS BECAUSE OF BURIAL

3922
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
ARRANGEMENTS AND GRIEVING AND

3923
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
THAT'S THE TENSION IN THE NEXT

3924
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,000
COUPLE OF DAYS.

3925
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
>> AND HOW IS THE

3926
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:03,000
COMMUNICATION FOR THE MOST
PART IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS,

3927
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:04,000
YOU HAVE A BE JOB TO DO, GUYS

3928
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
LIKE YOU, TO GET THE PARENTS

3929
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
THAT WANT TO KNOW DETAILS

3930
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
ABOUT THEIR CHILD.

3931
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:11,000
AND HOW IS--

3932
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
WAYNE CARVER THE CHIEF MEDICAL

3933
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:14,000
EXAMINER HAS BEEN AROUND A

3934
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
LONG TIME AND ONE OF THE

3935
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO IS TO

3936
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:19,000
GO TO THE--

3937
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:20,000
PERIODICALLY TO GO TO THE

3938
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
FIREHOUSE AND TELL THE PARENTS

3939
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
WHAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE

3940
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU

3941
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
RAISED, AND GIVE ANSWERS TO

3942
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:29,000
THE PARENTS SO THEY'RE NOT

3943
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,000
LEFT OUT.

3944
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
THAT THIS WAS A PROBLEM OF

3945
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
FLIGHT 800 AND WHEN THEY WERE,

3946
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:35,000
ALL THE PARENTS WERE--

3947
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
MENTS A LOT OF ANGER.

3948
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:38,000
>> AND STILL A THE LOT OF

3949
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
ANGER, BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T

3950
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,000
KEPT UP-TO-DATE.

3951
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:42,000
AND HERE I'M SURE SOMEBODY

3952
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
FROM THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S

3953
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
OFFICE AND SOMEBODY FROM THE

3954
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,000
POLICE DEPARTMENT, GOING

3955
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:48,000
PERIODICALLY EVERY HOUR, TWO

3956
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,000
HOURS, TELLING THE FAMILIES

3957
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT'S

3958
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
HAPPENING.
AND SO THAT THEY DON'T GET IT

3959
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
FROM TELEVISION, THEY SHOULD

3960
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
GET IT BEFORE IT GOES ON THE

3961
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
TUBE.
>> WELL, OUR CORRESPONDENT UP

3962
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
THERE REPORTED THE STORY THAT

3963
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
APPARENTLY THEY HAVE SET UP A

3964
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
MAKESHIFT MORGUE INSIDE THE

3965
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:06,000
SCHOOL AND THEY'VE TAKEN

3966
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
PICTURES OF THE CHILDREN.

3967
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:09,000
>> RIGHT.

3968
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
>> AND THEN IS IT STANDARD

3969
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
THEN TO HAVE THE PARENT

3970
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
IDENTIFY THEIR CHILD FROM A

3971
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:18,000
PHOTOGRAPH?
>> YES, THEY HAVE TO MAKE, THE

3972
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
EASIEST WAY TO IDENTIFY THE

3973
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,000
CHILDREN WOULD BE MY

3974
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,000
PHOTOGRAPHS, RATHER THAN

3975
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:23,000
SEEING THE BODIES.
>> THEY DIDN'T WANT THE

3976
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,000
PARENTS TO COME INTO THE

3977
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:25,000
SCHOOL.

3978
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
>> RIGHT, RIGHT, SO THEY CAN

3979
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,000
DO IT BY PHOTOGRAPHS OR BY

3980
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
VIDEO AND THEN THE PARENT WILL

3981
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE THEIR

3982
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
CHILDREN AT THE FUNERAL HOME

3983
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:37,000
AFTER EVERYTHING IS--

3984
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
THE BLOOD--
>> DON'T GO TO THE CRIME

3985
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:40,000
SCENE.

3986
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:41,000
>> IT'S STILL A CRIME SCENE.

3987
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,000
>> Brian: DR. BODDEN IN

3988
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
EVERYTHING YOU'VE SEEN, IS IT

3989
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:45,000
POSSIBLE, CAN YOU EVEN MAKE

3990
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:48,000
SENSE OF A KILLER WHO CAN BE

3991
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:51,000
AS HEARTLESS TO ASSASSINATE

3992
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
CHILDREN AT POINT BLANK RANGE?

3993
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT

3994
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
MINDSET.
>> LET ME TELL YOU 50 YEARS OF

3995
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:58,000
EXPERIENCE OF DOING THIS

3996
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,000
STUFF.

3997
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,000
EVERY MASS MURDER IS

3998
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
DIFFERENT.
THIS ARE DIFFERENT BASES, I'VE

3999
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
NEVER BEEN IN A SITUATION

4000
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
WHERE CHILDREN WERE SELECTED

4001
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:09,000
TO BE KILLED LIKE THIS AND

4002
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:12,000
THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT HE HAD

4003
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:13,000
SOMETHING WITH HIS MOTHER THAT

4004
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:14,000
CAUSED HIM TO KILL HIS MOTHER

4005
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:17,000
AND THEN KILLS ALL OF THE

4006
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
CHILDREN, PRESUMABLY THAT SHE

4007
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
MAY HAVE DONE SOME TEACHING

4008
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
WITH.
SO, YEAH, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND

4009
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
IT, BUT YOU CAN'T--

4010
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
>> AND HAS NEVER KILLED

4011
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
BEFORE, NEVER BEEN IN TROUBLE,

4012
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:30,000
EVIDENTLY.
>> EXCEPT HE WAS KIND OF A

4013
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
LONER AND FELT LEFT OUT AND HE

4014
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
WASN'T A JOINER.

4015
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:35,000
>> Alisyn: IS THAT A

4016
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
UNIVERSAL?

4017
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:37,000
>> THAT OFTEN HAPPENS WITH

4018
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:38,000
THESE KIDS.

4019
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:39,000
THEY'RE NOT JOINERS AND WANT

4020
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
TO GET EVEN AND SHOW

4021
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:42,000
EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE

4022
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
SUPERMEN AND IT'S ALSO

4023
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,000
INTERESTING THAT POLICE HAVE

4024
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
HAVE TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OF

4025
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:48,000
THE WEAPONS AND THE AMMUNITION

4026
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,000
WAS IN THE HOUSEHOLD, YOU

4027
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:52,000
KNOW, THAT HE COULD USE, BUT

4028
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,000
CERTAINLY, HE HAD TO PREPARE

4029
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
BY GETTING THE BULLET-PROOF

4030
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
VEST AND THE CAMOUFLAGE

4031
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,000
CHOATING.

4032
02:30:58,000 --> 02:30:59,000
AND THIS IS' STILL SOME THINGS

4033
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:00,000
OUT THERE.

4034
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:01,000
REMEMBER, THEY FOUND ANOTHER

4035
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:04,000
PERSON IN THE WOODS WITH

4036
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:05,000
CAMOUFLAGE IN THE BEGINNING.

4037
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:06,000
>> Brian: YES.

4038
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:07,000
>> AS YOU SAID EARLIER, EACH

4039
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:08,000
NEWSPAPER IS GIVING A LITTLE

4040
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
DIFFERENT STORY WHAT HAPPENED

4041
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,000
AND PRESUMABLY THIS--

4042
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
>> ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATED

4043
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:14,000
THINGS HAPPENED.

4044
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
WE SEE DR. BODDEN AND OTHER

4045
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
EXPERTS AS THEY LEAVE OUR SET

4046
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:19,000
TO GO GREEN ROOM AND YOU GUYS

4047
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:20,000
ARE TRYING TO PIECE THIS

4048
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
TOGETHER, TOO, BECAUSE THERE'S

4049
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:23,000
A LOT OF ANSWERS NOBODY HAS.

4050
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
>> I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET

4051
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:26,000
A LOT OF INFORMATION FROM THIS

4052
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
PRESS CONFERENCE, HOPEFULLY.

4053
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,000
>> THEY HAVE HE' BEEN VERY

4054
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
RESPONSIBLE AND THEY, YOU

4055
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:32,000
KNOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE AS SOON

4056
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
AS IT'S RELIABLE INFORMATION,

4057
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:37,000
THEY HAVE SHARED IT WITH US.

4058
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
>> IT'S RELIABLE BECAUSE THEY

4059
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:40,000
WANT EVERYBODY PROPERLY

4060
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
IDENTIFIED AND--

4061
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,000
>> WONDER WHAT THE DELAYS ARE,

4062
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
THE DELAY COULD SHOW THEY'RE

4063
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
FINDING OUT NEW INFORMATION.

4064
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:48,000
>> IT WAS INTERESTING LAST

4065
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:49,000
NIGHT WHEN THE SERGEANT VANCE,

4066
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:50,000
THE TROOPER.

4067
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:51,000
>> STATE POLICE.

4068
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:52,000
>> THE STATE POLICE, HE WAS

4069
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
SOLID AND HE WAS AT EIGHT

4070
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:55,000
O'CLOCK AND HE MEANT EIGHT

4071
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
O'CLOCK SO THERE'S SOMETHING

4072
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
GOING ON RIGHT NOW TO MAKE A

4073
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:00,000
DELAY.
>> RIGHT AND SOME OF THE

4074
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,000
REPORTERS WERE ASKING SOME

4075
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:02,000
QUESTIONS, NOW WHAT?

4076
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:03,000
I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO THAT

4077
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
RIGHT NOW.

4078
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:06,000
>> HE WAS VERY GOOD IN THE

4079
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
FACT THAT DEFLECTING CERTAIN

4080
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:09,000
QUESTIONS AND SAYING, HEY,

4081
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:12,000
LOOK, WE'RE NOT UP TO THAT,

4082
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:13,000
YET.
>> Alisyn: THANKS SO MUCH FOR

4083
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:14,000
STICKING AROUND WITH US AND

4084
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:15,000
CALL UPON YOUR EXPERTISE,

4085
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
AGAIN WE'RE WAITING FOR THE

4086
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
PRESS CONFERENCE IN NEWTOWN,

4087
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:20,000
CONNECTICUT YOU CAN SEE ALL

4088
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:21,000
THE REPORTERS AND

4089
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:22,000
PHOTOGRAPHERS THERE ASSEMBLED

02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
GOING TO KEEP AN EYE ON IT AND

4093
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
WE'RE GOING TO HOPE THIS DELAY

4094
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:29,000
MEANS THEY HAVE NEW

4095
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:30,000
INFORMATION OF POSSIBLY ABOUT

4096
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:33,000
THE SHOOTER, POSSIBLY ABOUT

4097
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE

02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
VICTIMS AND THE ONGOING

4099
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:38,000
INVESTIGATION.

4102
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL

4103
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:45,000
AT THE SCHOOL, A 47-YEAR-OLD

4104
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:50,000
EDUCATOR BY THE NAME OF DAWN,

4105
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
AND SHE HAD BEEN AT THE SCHOOL

4106
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:57,000
A COUPLE OF YEARS AND BY ALL

4107
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:59,000
ACCOUNTS A FANTASTIC PRINCIPAL

4108
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:00,000
AND ABSOLUTELY LOVED HER JOB.
SHE WAS SADLY MURDERED

4109
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:01,000
YESTERDAY, SHE WAS IN A

4110
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
MEETING WITH ONE OF THE

4111
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:06,000
PARENTS.
>> AND THE SCHOOL

4112
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,000
PSYCHOLOGIST.

4113
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
>> Steve: AND THE SCHOOL

02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:14,000
APPARENTLY THE BROKE THROUGH

4117
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,000
THE GLASS AND THERE SHE IS

4118
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:16,000
RIGHT THERE.

4119
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
SHE HAD THE KIND OF, APPROACH

4120
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
TO EDUCATION THAT MADE IT FUN

4121
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:21,000
TO LEARN.

4122
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:22,000
>> Alisyn: YEAH SHE WAS

4123
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:23,000
DESCRIBED AS PASSIONATE

4124
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
EXTREMELY DEDICATED AND SHE

4125
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
SENT OUT A LOT OF TWEETS.

4126
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
ONE OF THE ONES THAT STRUCK ME

4127
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
WAS ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL

4128
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,000
THIS YEAR, SHE TALKED ABOUT

4129
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:35,000
HOW EXCITED SHE WAS TO WELCOME

4130
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
THE NEW KINDERGARTENERS IN FOR

4131
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
THEIR LIFE LONG LOVE OF

LEARNING, SHE HOPED TO BE ABLE

4133
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:42,000
TO STOKE THAT.

4134
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
ANOTHER TWEET SHE SENT OUT ON

4135
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:45,000

02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
ANNUAL EVALUATION DRILL.

4140
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:53,000
>> Brian: A LOT OF TIMES

4141
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
PEOPLE WOULD TRY TO GET INTO

4142
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
THE BUILDING AND EVEN IF

02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000

4145
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT THE

4146
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,000
NEW SAFETY PROCEDURES IN

02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:04,000

GETTING INTO THE SCHOOL.

4158
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:18,000
AND THAT WAS THE LETTER THAT

4159
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:21,000

02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:26,000
LOCKED START AGO 9:30 IN THE

4163
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
MORNING, IF YOU WANTED TO GET

4164
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
IN, YOU HAD TO GO TO THE FRONT

4165
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:31,000
DOOR, RING THE DOOR BELL AND

4166
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:34,000
THEY WOULD BE BUZZED IN.

4167
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
YESTERDAY NOBODY BUZZED IN THE

4168
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
GUY WITH THE GUNS, INSTEAD

4169
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,000
BROKE THE GLASS AND CAME IN

4170
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
AND CONFRONTATION AND THAT

4171
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
JUST OUTSIDE THE OFFICE WHEN

4172
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:46,000
HE MURDERED THE PRINCIPAL.

4173
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
>> AND SHE WAS HIRED IN 2010,

4174
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:49,000
ALREADY MAKING IMPACT ON THE

4175
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:53,000
SCHOOL AND SHE WAS JOINED BY

4176
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:56,000
MARY SHERLOCK, 56 YEARS OLD.

4177
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
BEEN THERE 18 YEARS AND ACCORD

4178
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,000
TO GO A FAMILY MEMBER, AND SHE

4179
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
IS SURVIVED BY A HUSBAND AND

4180
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
OLDER DAUGHTERS IN THEIR 20'S

4181
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:09,000
AND HEARD THE POPS, AND NOT

4182
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
SPECIAL TRAINING, BUT WHEN YOU

4183
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
HEAR THE GUN GO OFF AND YOU

4184
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
RUN TO THE GUN.

4185
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:16,000
THAT'S INCREDIBLE INSTINCTS.

4186
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
>> Steve: AND ALSO, WE'VE BEEN

4187
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
WONDERING WHY WOULD THIS GUY

4188
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
SHOOT AND MURDER HIS MOTHER

4189
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
AND THEN GO TO THE SCHOOL?

4190
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:25,000
RIGHT?

4191
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:26,000
AND THE STORY HAS BEEN, YOU

4192
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,000
KNOW, SHE HAD BEEN A TEACHER

4193
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
THERE OR A TEACHER'S AIDE OR

4194
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:30,000
SHE HAD SOME SORT OF A

4195
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:31,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH IT.

4196
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
AND APPARENTLY WE'VE JUST

4197
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,000
HEARD FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT

4198
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,000
OF SCHOOLS UP THERE, SHE WAS

4199
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
NOT ON THE STAFF.

4200
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:38,000
SHE DID NOT HAVE A

4201
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SCHOOL.

4202
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
SO, THAT MAKES HIS APPEARANCE

4203
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:45,000
AT THE SCHOOL ABOUT 23 HOURS

4204
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:48,000
AGO, EVEN THE MORE PUZZLING.

4205
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:49,000
AND SANDY HOOK.

4206
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:50,000
>> Steve: SHE'S NOT IN THE

4207
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:51,000
SCHOOL'S DATA BASE.

4208
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:52,000
>> Alisyn: INTERESTING, WELL,

4209
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
HOPEFULLY AT THE PRESS

4210
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:57,000
CONFERENCE, A REPORTER WILL

4211
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:58,000
HAVE SOME ANSWERS.

4212
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
AND WE'LL BRING BY DR. MARK

4213
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:01,000
SEGAL.

4214
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:04,000
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE PTSD

4215
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
NOT JUST FOR THE IMMEDIATE

4216
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
KIDS IN THE SCHOOL AND

4217
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:09,000
IMMEDIATE PARENTS, BUT FOR ALL

4218
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:10,000
OF US NATIONWIDE.

4219
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE

4220
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:13,000
E-MAILED AND PEOPLE IN

4221
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:14,000
WASHINGTON STATE E-MAILED HOW

4222
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
DEVASTATED THEY ARE BY ALL OF

4223
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
THIS.
HOW DO YOU START TO ADDRESS

4224
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:19,000
THAT?

4225
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
>> WELL, ALISYN IT SPANS

4226
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
OUTWARD.
FOR THE KIDS OF THE SCHOOL

4227
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL

4228
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:30,000
CENTER OF PTSD, MANY ARE GOING

4229
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
TO SUFFER FOR DRAMATIC CHANGES

4230
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,000
AND WHEN THEY PLAY, FEEL

4231
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:34,000
AGGRESSIVE AND ANTICIPATE THE

4232
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:35,000
NEXT TRAGEDY, IT'S JUST

4233
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:38,000
TERRIBLE, THEY'RE GOING TO BE

4234
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:39,000
NERVOUS, THEY FEEL A

4235
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:40,000
PREMONITION OF SOMETHING ELSE

4236
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
COMING ON AND MAY FEEL

4237
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:43,000
SADNESS, ANXIETY.

4238
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:44,000
VERY TOUGH TO GET OVER.

4239
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:45,000
THERAPY WILL BE REQUIRED AND

4240
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
EVEN FOR KIDS IN THE

4241
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:48,000
NEIGHBORHOOD NOWHERE NEAR THE

4242
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
SCHOOL, ABOUT 30, 40% OF THEM

4243
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:53,000
WILL FEEL THE SYMPTOMS OF

4244
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:56,000
PTSD, HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING,

4245
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:57,000
LOW SELF-ESTEEM.

4246
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:58,000
TROUBLE CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE

4247
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
AND FOR THE REST OF US, IT

4248
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
DEPENDS ON HOW WE HANDLE THIS,

4249
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:07,000
A LOTS OF US ARE FOCUSED ON

4250
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
THE MEDIA AND OUR
REPRESENTATION ON TELEVISION.

4251
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,000
WHAT ARE WE TELLING OUR

4252
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:13,000
CHILDREN, TO BE EMPATHETIC, TO

4253
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
CARE ABOUT THE VICTIMS AND NOT

4254
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
FOCUS SO MUCH ON OURSELVES,

4255
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR KIDS

4256
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:22,000
SCHOOLS AND THE CHANCE OF THIS

4257
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
HAPPENING AGAIN, LESS THAN 1%

4258
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
OF ALL HOMICIDES IN THE UNITED

4259
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:29,000
STATES OCCUR AROUND SCHOOLS,

4260
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:30,000
LESS THAN 1%.

4261
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:34,000
IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T SEEM THAT

4262
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
WAY THIS MORNING AND CERTAINLY
WE HAVE TO REPORT THIS THE WAY

4263
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:37,000
THEY'RE REPORTING IT, I DON'T

4264
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
WANT MY CHILDREN TO BE AFRAID.

4265
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:40,000
I WANT MY CHILDREN TO CARE

4266
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
ABOUT THE CHILDREN OUT THERE.

4267
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:43,000
>> Brian: YOU'RE SAYING, YOU

4268
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:44,000
CAN TELL THEM FLAT OUT IT'S

4269
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU,

4270
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:51,000
EVEN THOUGH YOU NEVER CAN BE

4271
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:54,000
100% SURE, IT DOESN'T HAPPEN

4272
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:55,000
EVERY DAY, SECOND WORST

4273
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
MASSACRE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR

4274
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:58,000
COUNTRY WITH EDUCATION, AND

4275
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
HIT THEM WITH THE STATS.

4276
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,000
>> RIGHT, I LIKE EXACTLY THE

4277
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:02,000
WAY YOU PUT THAT.

4278
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
YOU HAVE TO ANSWER THEIR

4279
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:05,000
QUESTIONS AND YOU HAVE TO

4280
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
ANSWER THEM HONESTLY, LOOK,

4281
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
THEY'RE LOOKING HOW YOU'RE

4282
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:10,000
ANSWERING, ARE YOU WORRIED,

4283
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
LOOK LIKE YOU'RE WORRIED TO

4284
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:13,000
SEND YOUR CHILD TO SCHOOL

4285
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
TOMORROW, ON MONDAY.

4286
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
YOU SHOULD THINK THOSE

4287
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:18,000
STATISTICS OUT IN YOUR OWN

4288
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:19,000
BRAIN FIRST THAT IT'S KNOTS

4289
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
GOING TO HAPPEN THE SCHOOL.

4290
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:22,000
YOU HAVE TO PROJECT CALM AND

4291
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:23,000
CONFIDENCE AND CARING, YOU

4292
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
WANT YOUR KIDS TO CARE FOR THE

4293
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:29,000
VICTIMS AND YOU CARE FOR THEM.

4294
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:30,000
>> Brian: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

4295
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:33,000
THE SHOOTER, THE KILLER.

4296
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:34,000
IS IT POSSIBLE, AND GETTING

4297
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:35,000
INSIDE HIS HEAD, IS IT

4298
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
POSSIBLE THIS GUY IS JUST

4299
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
EVIL?
TO SIT IN FRONT OF A KID AND

4300
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:42,000
SHOOT AT A CHILD FIVE YEARS

4301
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
OLD IN THE HEAD, IS IT THAT

4302
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:47,000
SIMPLE?
>> BRIAN WITH ALL OF MY

4303
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:48,000
MEDICAL TRAINING, I CAN LOOK

4304
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:49,000
AT THINGS CLINICALLY AND I CAN

4305
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,000
GIVE YOU REASON, BUT I

4306
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,000
ABSOLUTELY REFUSE TO LOOK AT A

4307
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:56,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS, WHERE SO

4308
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
MANY--
SOMEBODY ALLEGEDLY

4309
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
COLD-BLOODEDLY GUNS DOWN

4310
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:04,000
CHILDREN THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF

4311
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:05,000
EVIL.

4312
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:08,000
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY A MEDICAL

4313
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:09,000
DIAGNOSIS, I DON'T BELIEVE

4314
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:14,000
THERE IS JUST A DISORDER OR AN

4315
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
AUTISTIC--
THIS SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY IS

4316
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:17,000
PSYCHOTIC AND DILUTIONAL AND

4317
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
THINK THE CHILDREN REPRESENT

4318
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:20,000
SOMETHING ELSE.

4319
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:21,000
>> Alisyn: ISN'T THAT HAD A

4320
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:22,000
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

4321
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:23,000
>> MUCH WORSE.

4322
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
A 20-YEAR-OLD, I'M THINKING

4323
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:26,000
SCHIZOPHRENIC, BIPOLAR

4324
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,000
DISORDER.

4325
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:28,000
SOMEBODY WAS OUT OF TOUCH

4326
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,000
COMPLETELY WITH REHE ALT, BUT

4327
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
THAT DOESN'T LET THAT PERSON

4328
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:36,000
OFF THE HOOK, ALISYN, PLENTY

4329
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:38,000
OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT ARE NOT

4330
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
GOING AROUND SHOOTING PEOPLE.

4331
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:41,000
>> Steve: A GOOD POINT.

4332
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:42,000
IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING US,

4333
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:43,000
WE'RE AWAITING A PRESS

4334
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:44,000
CONFERENCE AND THE AUTHORITIES

4335
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
IN CONNECTICUT ARE RELEASING

4336
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:47,000
THE INFORMATION THAT THEY

4337
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:48,000
GATHERED OVERNIGHT AND DR.

4338
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:51,000
SEGAL, YOU KNOW, THE LAST 23

4339
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
YEARS HAVE BEEN REALLY HARD

4340
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
FOR 20 SETS OF PARENTS THEY

4341
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:59,000
PUT THEIR KIDS IN FRONT DOOR

4342
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
OF THAT SCHOOL, YESTERDAY

4343
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:02,000
MORNING ABOUT THIS TIME AND

4344
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
THEY REMAINED ONNED FLOOR

4345
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:05,000
OVERNIGHT.

4346
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:06,000
AND IT'S, YOU KNOW, AND FOR

4347
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:07,000
THE POLICE TO SAY, TELL US

4348
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
WHAT YOUR CHILD WAS WEARING

4349
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:12,000
WHEN THEY WENT TO SCHOOL,

4350
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:13,000
THAT'S SO HARD FOR A PARENT

4351
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:14,000
AND FOR THE PARENTS WATCHING

4352
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:17,000
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT

4353
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
KIDS WHO WENT TO SCHOOL AFTER

4354
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:20,000
COLUMBINE AND EVERY TIME THERE

4355
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:21,000
WAS ANOTHER SCHOOL SHOOTING

4356
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:22,000
THEY WOULD JUST FREAK OUT.

4357
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
THEY'D HEAR ABOUT IT AT SCHOOL

4358
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:25,000
AND THEY WORRIED THAT'S GOING

4359
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:26,000
TO HAPPEN TO THEM, EVEN

4360
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:30,000
THOUGH, YOU KNOW, WE DID

4361
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
DISCUSS WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO

4362
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
DO.
KIDS WORRY.

4363
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
>> AND I CAN'T IMAGINE THE

4364
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:39,000
PARENTS HAVING THE COURAGE,

4365
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:42,000
AND THE IDEA OF PUTTING YOUR

4366
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:43,000
KIDS' CAR SEAT IN THE TRUNK

4367
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:44,000
AND KNOWING YOU'RE NEVER GOING

4368
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:45,000
TO LOSE IT.

4369
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:46,000
I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND I

4370
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,000
CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE

4371
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
TO LOSE ONE OF MY CHILDREN AND

4372
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:50,000
FACE THE CAMERAS AND GO

4373
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:51,000
THROUGH A CRIMINAL

4374
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:52,000
INVESTIGATION AND YOU KNOW,

4375
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
IT'S JUST, THIS IS THE

02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:55,000
GREATEST TRAGEDY.

WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THOSE

02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:42,000
KINDS OF THINGS AND FIND OUT

4435
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
AT THIS PRESS CONFERENCE,

4436
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
WHETHER OR NOT THIS INDIVIDUAL

LEFT ANY NOTES.

4438
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:48,000
WE HAVEN'T HEARD THAT YET, BUT

4439
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
COULD HAVE LEFT A NOTE I'M

4440
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
TALKING ABOUT THE SHOOTER.

4441
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:53,000
WHETHER OR NOT HE HAD A

4442
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:54,000
FACEBOOK PAGE, WHAT WAS ON IT.

4443
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
WHAT IS ON HIS COMPUTER AND

4444
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:57,000
MAYBE NOT SPECIFIC DETAILS

4445
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:58,000
WHAT WAS ON HIS COMPUTER, BUT

4446
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THOSE

4447
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:01,000
KINDS OF THINGS, WHAT WE NEED

4448
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
RIGHT NOW IS CLOSURE.

4449
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
THE FAMILIES NEED CLOSURE,

4450
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
THEY NEED TO KNOW WHY THIS GUY

4451
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:10,000
DO WHAT HE DID AND WHY DID HE

4452
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:11,000
IN FACT TARGET THIS PARTICULAR

4453
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:12,000
SCHOOL.
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING,

4454
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:13,000
STEVE.

4455
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:14,000
A FEW MINUTES AGO WHEN BRIAN

4456
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
TOLD US AND SHARED WITH US THE

4457
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
NEWS THAT THIS GUY, HIS MOTHER

4458
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
MAY HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN ON THE

4459
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:21,000
PAYROLL THERE AT THE SCHOOL.

4460
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:22,000
AS YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY HAS

4461
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:23,000
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT, SO

4462
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:26,000
WHEN HE SAID THAT I THOUGHT TO

4463
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:29,000
MYSELF OKAY, THEN THERE IS

4464
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:30,000
ANOTHER REASON THEN WHY THIS
GUY SELECTED THAT SCHOOL AND

4465
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,000
MAYBE IT'S NOT HIS MOTHER AND

4466
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE

4467
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:34,000
OUT.
>> RIGHT.

4468
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:35,000
WE'RE SAYING THAT SHE'S NOT

4469
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:36,000
CURRENTLY ON THE PAYROLL, BUT

4470
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,000
COULD HAVE BEEN AS YEAR OR THE

4471
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:38,000
YEAR BEFORE.

4472
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
AND ALSO PART OF THE STORY

4473
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
THAT I READ AND I CANNOT

4474
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:43,000
REMEMBER THE PUBLICATION, IS

4475
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:44,000
THAT SHE QUIT TO SPEND MORE

4476
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
TIME WITH HER SON WHO WAS TO

4477
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:47,000
SAY THE LEAST, A HANDFUL.

4478
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
AND ACCORDING TO THE NEIGHBORS

4479
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
THEY KNEW HE WAS A HANDFUL.

4480
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
>> YOU KNOW, I'M WONDERING IF

4481
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:54,000
THIS GUY USED TO GO BACK AND

4482
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:57,000
FORTH UP TO THAT SCHOOL A LOT

4483
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:58,000
AND MAYBE THE SCHOOL

4484
02:43:58,000 --> 02:43:59,000
ENCOURAGED THE MOTHER TO SPEND

4485
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:00,000
MORE TIME WITH HIM AT THE HOME

4486
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:03,000
AND MAYBE THAT TICKED THIS GUY

4487
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
OFF.
IN A SENSE THAT KIND OF MADE

4488
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
SENSE.
THERE HAD TO BE SOME REASON,

4489
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
BRIAN, EVEN THOUGH SHE MAY

4490
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
HAVE HAVE NOT BEEN CURRENTLY

4491
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:14,000
ON THE PAYROLL, AND WHY HE

4492
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:15,000
DECIDED TO GO YESTERDAY.

4493
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:16,000
AND THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION,

4494
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,000
WHY YESTERDAY?

4495
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
WHY NOT A WEEK AGO, MAYBE

4496
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
GETTING THE AMMUNITION, CALMO,

4497
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
FLAK JACKET.

4498
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:24,000
THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT

4499
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:25,000
EVERYBODY, INCLUDING THE

4500
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:26,000
FAMILIES NEED TO KNOW AND NEED

4501
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:27,000
TO KNOW RIGHT AWAY.

4502
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:28,000
>> Alisyn: I HAVE A QUESTION

4503
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,000
ABOUT HOW THE POLICE WILL

4504
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
HANDLE THE POLICE CONFERENCE,

4505
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
BECAUSE THERE BE ARGUABLY NOT

4506
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:34,000
BE A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION,

4507
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:35,000
BECAUSE THE SHOOTER KILLED

4508
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
HIMSELF SO THEY DON'T NEED TO

4509
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:38,000
BE KEEPING THINGS CLOSE TO

4510
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:39,000
THEIR VEST IN TERMS OF

4511
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:40,000
INFORMATION ABOUT HIM.

4512
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
WILL THAT MAKE THE POLICE LESS

4513
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
HAM STRUNG AT THIS PRESS

4514
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
CONFERENCE?
WILL THEY BE ABLE TO GIVE THE

4515
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
PUBLIC MUCH MORE INFORMATION

4516
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY HAD

4517
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:51,000
SOMEBODY IN CUSTODY RIGHT NOW?

4518
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:52,000
>> YES AND NO.

4519
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
LET ME QUICKLY EXPLAIN WHAT I

4520
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
MEAN BY THAT ALISYN.

4521
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:57,000
THIS IS A CRIMINAL

4522
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:58,000
INVESTIGATION, YES, WE DO KNOW

4523
02:44:58,000 --> 02:44:59,000
THAT THE SHOOTER, ALLEGED

4524
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:00,000
SHOOTER SHOT AND KILLED

4525
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:01,000
HIMSELF.

4526
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:02,000
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW, ALISYN,

4527
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:03,000
WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS

4528
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
ANYBODY AFFILIATED WITH THIS

4529
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:06,000
GUY THAT STILL MAY BE OUT

4530
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:07,000
THERE.

4531
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:08,000
WE DON'T KNOW THAT SO THE

4532
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
POLICE HAVE TO BE A LITTLE

4533
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
CAUTIOUS, ALISYN IN TERMS OF

4534
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:13,000
HOW MUCH INFORMATION THEY GIVE

4535
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:14,000
TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

4536
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:15,000
THEY'LL SHARE A LOT MORE

4537
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
INFORMATION, JUST SO YOU I

4538
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
DON'T, SHARE A LOT MORE

4539
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:24,000
INFORMATION WITH THE DESECEDEN S

4540
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
DECEDENTS' FAMILIES THAN US.

4541
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:29,000
AND IT COULD BE WEEKS, OR

4542
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:32,000
MONTHS.
>> I'M LOOKING AT THE NEWTOWN

4543
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:35,000
PATCH THERE, THE LOCAL

4544
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:36,000
NEWSPAPER AND SAID AT THIS

4545
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
POINT ANY KIND OF A MOTIVE IS

4546
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:39,000
MURKY, UNCLEAR.

4547
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
WITH REGARDING THE PRESS

4548
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
CONFERENCE AT THAT WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN 45 MINUTES

4549
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:44,000
AGO AND STILL WAITING FOR IT.

4550
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
IT SAYS THAT THE POLICE ARE

4551
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
WORKING BACKWARDS TO PIECE

4552
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:49,000
TOGETHER THE WHY'S BEHIND THE

4553
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:50,000
SHOOTING.

4554
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
EXPLAIN THAT, WOULD YOU,

4555
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:53,000
WORKING BACKWARDS?

4556
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:54,000
>> YES, IN EVERY CRIMINAL

4557
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:55,000
INVESTIGATION, GUYS, GOOD

4558
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
INFORMATION YOU ALWAYS WANT TO

4559
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:58,000
WORK BACKWARDS.

4560
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,000
YOU NEVER MAKE ASSUMPTIONS, IF

4561
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:00,000
YOU MAKE ASSUMPTIONS THAT

4562
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:03,000
MEANS YOU'RE WORKING FORWARD,

4563
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:04,000
YOU THINK THIS IS WHAT
HAPPENED.

4564
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
WHEN YOU WORK BACKWARDS YOU'RE

4565
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
TRYING TO TRACE THIS GUY'S

4566
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
LIFE WHERE WAS HE AT THE NIGHT

4567
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:11,000
BEFORE THE SHOOTING OCCURRED?

4568
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
WHO WAS HE TALKING TO?

4569
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
THEY HAVE HIS CELL PHONE AND

4570
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:18,000
EVERY OFF HIS CELL PHONE AND

4571
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
CALLING THOSE FOLKS AND THE

4572
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
FBI IS AT THESE FOLKS' HOUSES

4573
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY MEAN,

4574
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO TRY TO

4575
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:27,000
FIND SOME UNDERSTANDING TO

4576
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:30,000
FIND WHY THIS GUY DID WHAT HE

4577
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
DID.
>> THE LAST QUESTION BEFORE WE

4578
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:33,000
GO TO THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND

4579
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
BRING IN A REPORTER FROM THE

4580
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
NEWTOWN PATCH, FROM YOUR

4581
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:40,000
EXPERIENCE, WHEN A PRESS

4582
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:44,000
CONFERENCE IS 45 MINUTES LATE
AFTER A HORRIFIC CRIME LIKE WE

4583
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
JUST SAW PERPETRATED, DOES IT

4584
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
USUALLY MEAN THAT SOMETHING IS

4585
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:49,000
UNFOLDING?
>> YES AND NO AGAIN, BRIAN.

4586
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT

4587
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:52,000
ANSWER, YES AND NO, BUT THE

4588
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:53,000
REASON I'M SAYING THAT, I

4589
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:54,000
WOULDN'T READ TOO MUCH IN THE

4590
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:55,000
FACT THAT THE PRESSER IS

4591
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF TIME.

4592
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:58,000
I THINK THE ONLY REASON THE

4593
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
PRESSER IS TAKING A LITTLE BIT

4594
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:01,000
MORE TIME BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

4595
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
BE CAREFUL NOW, GUYS, THEY

4596
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:04,000
HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN

4597
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
TERMS OF HOW MUCH INFORMATION

4598
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:07,000
THEY GIVE TO THE GENERAL

4599
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:08,000
PUBLIC.

4600
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:09,000
WHY?
BECAUSE THIS IS STILL A

4601
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:12,000
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND I

4602
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:13,000
BELIEVE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,

4603
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
THE FBI AND THE PROSECUTOR IN

4604
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:16,000
THAT COMMUNITY THERE, THEY'RE

4605
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
GOING THROUGH ALL THE

4606
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
INFORMATION TO DECIDE EXACTLY
WHAT THEY WANT TO RELEASE AND

4607
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
WOULDN'T READ TOO MUCH INTO

4608
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
THE FACT QUITE YET THIS IS

4609
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
TAKING A WHILE.

4610
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:27,000
>> Alisyn: THANK YOU, STANDING

4611
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
BY AND WE'LL TALK TO YOU AFTER

4612
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:30,000
THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

4613
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:33,000
OUR NEXT GUEST WAS ON THE

4614
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:36,000
GROUND AFTER HEARING THE NEWS,

4615
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:37,000
NEWTOWN LOCAL EDITOR FOR THE

4616
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
PATCH NEWSPAPER.

4617
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
AARON, GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

4618
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:42,000
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU

4619
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
ARRIVED ON THE SCENE

4620
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
YESTERDAY.
>> FIRST THING ARRIVING, IT

4621
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:50,000
WAS A SURPRISINGLY ORGANIZED

4622
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:53,000
CHAOS, THERE WERE PARENTS

4623
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:54,000
EVERYWHERE JUST WAITING TO
HEAR WHAT HAPPENED AND TO TRY

4624
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
TO FIND OUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED

4625
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:57,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN, IF THEIR

4626
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
CHILDREN WERE OKAY.

4627
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:00,000
AND PARENTS STANDING AROUND

4628
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
TRYING TO CONSOLE EACH OTHER.

4629
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
AND AFTER A TIME, THE POLICE

4630
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:05,000
START TODAY EVACUATE THE

4631
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
CHILDREN, THEY WERE BROUGHT AT

4632
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:08,000
ONE CLASS AT A TIME IN ORDER

4633
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
TO ACCOUNT FOR EVERYONE, AND

4634
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:11,000
WE WERE ABLE TO SEE A LOT OF

4635
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
FAMILIES REUNITED, A LOT OF

4636
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:16,000
JOY, TEMPERED JOY AS THEY

4637
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:20,000
REALIZED THAT OTHER FAMILIES

4638
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
AROUND THEM WEREN'T BEING RUE

4639
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:25,000
UNITED.
AND LATER IN THE DAY WE SAW

4640
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
MORE PARENTS BROUGHT IN AND

4641
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
SUBSEQUENTLY LEAVING WITHOUT

4642
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:30,000
THEIR CHILDREN.

4643
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:31,000
>> Brian: I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU

4644
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:32,000
A QUESTION.

4645
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT'S FINE.

4646
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
SO MANY CONTRADICTORY WRITTEN

4647
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
BY REPUTABLE SOURCES.

4648
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
FIRST OFF, CAN YOU TELL ME IF

4649
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:41,000
HIS MOTHER WAS ACTUALLY

4650
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCHOOL AT

4651
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:44,000
ALL?

4652
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
IF SO, WHEN?
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY

4653
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
WHEN.
WE KNOW SHE WAS AT SOME POINT

4654
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
A TEACHER WITH THE SCHOOL.

4655
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:53,000
AND AS YOU HEARD, WE'VE HEARD

4656
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:54,000
AS WELL, SHE NO LONGER WORKS

4657
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
THERE OFFICIALLY, BUT AT SOME

4658
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
POINT SHE WAS WITH THE SCHOOL

4659
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:59,000
SYSTEM.

4660
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:00,000
>> Brian: BUT WAS A TEACHER OR

4661
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:01,000
COULD SHE HAVE BEEN AN AIDE OR

4662
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,000
JUST A SUBSTITUTE?

4663
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
>> NOW, I BELIEVE TEACHER, BUT

4664
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
I'M NOT 100% CONFIDENT ON

4665
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:07,000
THAT.

4666
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:08,000
>> ALL RIGHT.

4667
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
AARON, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE

4668
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:11,000
PRINCIPAL, WHO WAS TRAGICALLY

4669
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:14,000
MURDERED YESTERDAY, HAD

4670
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:15,000
RECENTLY INSTALLED THAT BUZZER

4671
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
SYSTEM WHERE IF YOU WANTED TO

4672
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:18,000
GET IN THE SCHOOL AFTER SCHOOL

4673
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
STARTED YOU HAD TO GET BUZZED

4674
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:23,000
IN.
IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS ADAM LANZA

4675
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
ACTUALLY BROKE THE WINDOW.

4676
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
DO YOU KNOW THE EXTENT OF THE

4677
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
PRECAUTIONS THAT THE SCHOOL

4678
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
HAD MADE IN ADVANCE OF THE

4679
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
MASSACRE YESTERDAY?

4680
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:37,000
>> WELL, IT'S SIMILAR TO A LOT

4681
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:38,000
OF THE SAFETY MEASURES BEING

4682
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
INSTALLED IN A LOT OF SCHOOLS

4683
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
IN THE AREA.

4684
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:43,000
AND ACROSS THE INAUGURATION.

4685
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:44,000
BUZZERS ARE BECOMING MORE AND

4686
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
MORE TRADITIONAL WAY OF MAKING

4687
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:47,000
SURE THAT CHILDREN ARE SAFE.

4688
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:50,000
BUT, AS WE SAW YESTERDAY,

4689
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:51,000
THERE'S NO WAY TO KEEP

4690
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:52,000
EVERYONE SAFE 100% OF THE

4691
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:53,000
TIME.

4692
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:56,000
PEOPLE LIKE THIS WILL FIND A

4693
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:57,000
WAY.
>> Alisyn: AND IF SOMEONE

4694
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:58,000
WANTS TO BREAK IN, HE JUST

4695
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
BROKE IN.

4696
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
AARON, HAVE YOU AT YOUR PAPER

4697
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
BEEN ABLE TO FLESH OUT ANY

4698
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:05,000
MORE PICTURES OF THE SHOOTER,

4699
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:06,000
OF ADAM.

4700
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIS

4701
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:09,000
BACKGROUND?

4702
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:10,000
>> AT THIS POINT, NO, WE

4703
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY

4704
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
NEW INFORMATION THAT ISN'T

4705
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:15,000
ALREADY OUT THERE AND WE ARE

4706
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:18,000
HEAPING TO GET A LITTLE MORE

4707
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:19,000
FROM THE PRESS CONFERENCE

4708
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:20,000
WE'RE WAITING ON.

4709
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:21,000
>> Brian: SHOULD BE

4710
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
INTERESTING.
AND GIVE US AN IDEA THE PEOPLE

4711
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
OF NEWTON--

4712
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:26,000
NEWTOWN, I SHOULD SAY, TO HAVE

4713
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:29,000
TWO HANDGUNS AND A RIFLE

4714
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
REGISTERED LEGALLY TO SOMEONE.

4715
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:32,000
IS THERE A LOT OF HUNTING

4716
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
GOING ON IN THAT AREA.

4717
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:35,000
>> THERE'S CERTAINLY HUNTING

4718
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:36,000
IN CONNECTICUT AND THIS AREA,

4719
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:37,000
IT'S VERY WOODED.

4720
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
THERE'S A LARGE DEER

4721
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:40,000
POPULATION AND WE HAVE

4722
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:41,000
CONTROLLED DEER HUNTS EVERY

4723
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:44,000
YEAR, AND GUN OWNERSHIP IS NOT

4724
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:45,000
NECESSARILY UNUSUAL IN THIS

4725
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:46,000
AREA.

4726
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:51,000
AND THAT SAID, IT'S ALSO NOT

4727
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
PARTICULARLY PREVALENT EITHER.

4728
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
>> AND NEWTOWN LOCAL EDITOR OF

4729
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:56,000
THE PATCH.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

4730
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:57,000
>> THANK YOU.

4731
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:00,000
AND NOW WE'RE JOINED ON THE

4732
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
SET BY THE SECURITY EXPERT AS

4733
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
WELL, HARRY, WHEN WE SPOKE A

4734
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
COUPLE OF HOURS AGO.

4735
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:07,000
>> RIGHT.
>> Steve: THE NEWS FROM THE

4736
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
NEW YORK TIMES HAD BEEN THAT

4737
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
APPARENTLY THIS GUY CAME TO

4738
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
THE FRONT DOOR AND BECAUSE HE

4739
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:14,000
WAS THE SON AFTER WOMAN WHO

4740
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
HAD WORKED IN THE SCHOOL HE

4741
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:17,000
GOT BUZZED IN.

4742
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
AND AS IT TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT

4743
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:20,000
STORY.

4744
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:21,000
APPARENTLY HE APPEARED HAD

4745
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:24,000
CAMOUFLAGE ON AND GUNS IN HIS

4746
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:25,000
POCKET AND BROKE THROUGH THE

4747
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:26,000
GLASS.

4748
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:27,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS PARTICULAR

4749
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:28,000
SCHOOL DID HAVE AN ACTION

4750
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:29,000
PLAN.

4751
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:30,000
>> YES, IT DEFINITELY DID.

4752
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:33,000
AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU HOW

4753
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
IMPRESSED I AM WITH THAT THIRD

4754
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
GRADE TEACHER.
>> Alisyn: MY GOODNESS.

4755
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:40,000
>> I COULD NOT HAVE TAUGHT HER

4756
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
ANY BETTER.

4757
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:43,000
>> Steve: KIDS UP ON THE

4758
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:44,000
TOILET AND LOCKED THEMSELVES

4759
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:45,000
IN THE BATHROOM.

4760
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:46,000
>> RIGHT.
>> SHE DOESN'T REALIZE HOW

4761
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:49,000
MUCH OF A HERO SHE IS.

4762
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
SHE KEPT THAT DOOR LOCKED.

4763
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:54,000
THE SHOOTER TRIED TO ENTER THE

4764
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
BATHROOM, ALL RIGHT, IT

4765
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:59,000
APPEARS AND HE DIDN'T HAVE THE

4766
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:00,000
FORETHOUGHT TO SHOOT THROUGH

4767
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
THE DOOR.
HE SAW THAT AS A WAY OF

4768
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
IMPEDING WHAT HE WAS DOING,

4769
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:05,000
ALL RIGHTS, AND DECIDED TO

4770
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
TURN AROUND AND FIND AN EASIER

4771
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:08,000
TARGET.

4772
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:09,000
ALL RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENED.

4773
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:10,000
AND THAT TEACHER, IS SHE'S A

4774
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
HERO AND SHOULD BE VERY PROUD

4775
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:15,000
OF HERSELF.
>> AS IS THE MUSIC TEACHER,

4776
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:16,000
TOO, SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR

4777
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
AND HEARD BANGING ON THE DOOR.

4778
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:19,000
>> IN TERMS OF THIS CRIME, IS

4779
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
IT FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE,

4780
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE

4781
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:24,000
SOMEONE KILLING IN THIS, IN

4782
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
THIS COLD BLOOLDED WAY, FOR

4783
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
THE FIRST TIME AND THEN

4784
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:29,000
KILLING THEMSELVES?

4785
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:32,000
IS IT POSSIBLE TO SEE THIS

4786
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:33,000
HAPPENING, THAT THAT HAPPENED

4787
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
ONE DAY WITH NO CRIMINAL

4788
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
RECORD?
>> RIGHT, IT HAPPENS ALL THE

4789
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:38,000
TIME AND A LONG TIME AGO WHEN

4790
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
I WAS A DETECTIVE, I STOPPED

4791
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:41,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY

4792
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:42,000
PEOPLE DO THINGS.

4793
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:45,000
IT'S JUST TOTALSLY INSANE.

4794
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:46,000
I CAN'T SEE SOMEBODY STANDING

4795
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:49,000
THERE WITH A CLASSROOM FULL OF

4796
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:50,000
CHILDREN AND SITTING THERE AND

4797
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
EXECUTING THEM AND LOOKING AT

4798
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
THEIR BEAUTIFUL FACES.

4799
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
AND IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT

4800
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:59,000
YOU CAN'T THINK ABOUT.

4801
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:00,000
NOW?
AND AS A DETECTIVE, YOU KNOW,

4802
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:04,000
I'M USED TO SEEING BODIES, YOU

4803
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
KNOW, OF ADULTS ALL THE TIME,

4804
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
BUT YOU KNOW, WHEN IT'S A

4805
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
CHILD, YOU NEVER GET OVER IT.

4806
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:11,000
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T GET

4807
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:12,000
USED TO.

4808
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:13,000
I REMEMBER THE FIRST DEAD

4809
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
CHILD I SAW WHEN I FIRST

4810
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:16,000
BECAME A COP IN 1978--

4811
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
>> I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT

4812
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:19,000
THAT.
I WANT TODAY ASK YOU ABOUT

4813
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:20,000
THAT.

4814
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
HOW CAN THE NEWTOWN POLICE

4815
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
EVER BE MENTALLY PREPARED FOR

4816
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:25,000
WHAT THEY ENCOUNTER WHEN THEY

4817
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
RAN INTO THE SCHOOL YESTERDAY.

4818
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:28,000
WHAT HAPPENED?

4819
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:31,000
THE NEWTOWN POLICE TAKE

4820
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAINING AND BE

4821
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
COMPOSED AT A SCENE LIKE THAT.

4822
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:36,000
>> NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.

4823
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
WE NEVER RECEIVED ANY KIND OF

4824
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:39,000
TRAINING.

4825
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:40,000
NOW WHAT THEY'LL DO, PROBABLY

4826
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:41,000
HAVE THOSE POLICE OFFICERS

4827
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:44,000
SPEAK TO PEOPLE TO HELP THEM

4828
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:45,000
DEAL WITH THIS.

4829
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:46,000
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE FIRST

4830
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:47,000
RESPONDING OFFICER TO WALK

4831
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
INTO THAT CHARM AND SEE ALL OF

4832
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:50,000
THOSE CHILDREN DID HE

4833
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
UNDERSTAND?
I MEAN, I CAN'T -- I CAN'T

4834
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
FATHOM THAT AT ALL.

4835
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:57,000
>> AND IN THREE MINUTES THE

4836
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
ENTIRE OPERATION, DOES THAT

4837
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
SURPRISE YOU?
>> I TELL WHAT YOU, THE MOST

4838
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:05,000
DANGEROUS PEOPLE IN AN ACTIVE

4839
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:06,000
SHOOTER INCIDENTS IS THE FIRST

4840
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:07,000
TWO AND THREE MINUTES.

4841
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:10,000
WHEN I WAS LISTENING TO THE

4842
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:13,000
POLICE RADIO ONLINE IT APPEARS

4843
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
THE SHOOTING WAS DONE WHEN THE

4844
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
POLICE ALREADY RESPONDED.

4845
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:18,000
>> Steve: IT WAS THAT FAST.

4846
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
AND TODAY, LOOK AT SOME OF THE

4847
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
BLOGS ARE ALREADY TALKING
ABOUT, DO WE NEED BETTER

4848
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:23,000
SECURITY, DO WE NEED TO

4849
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:24,000
CONTROL GUNS?

4850
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:27,000
AND YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S, THAT

4851
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:28,000
JUST HAPPENS IN CERTAIN PARTS

4852
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:29,000
OF THE INTERNET.

4853
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:30,000
>> RIGHT.
>> Steve: WHEN YOU LOOK AT

4854
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
9/11, I MEAN, 3000 PEOPLE WIND

4855
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
UP DYING NOT BECAUSE OF GUNS,

4856
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:39,000
BUT BECAUSE OF BOMBS.

4857
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
>> AND THAT'S A DEBATE ABOUT

4858
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:43,000
THAT.

4859
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:44,000
>> Steve: THERE NEEDS TO BE A

4860
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:45,000
DEBATES ABOUT THE CULTURE.

4861
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
>> WITHOUT A DOUBT, WITHOUT A

4862
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
DOUBT.
AND, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO PUT THE

4863
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
BLAME WHERE IT BELONGS, EVIL

4864
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:54,000
ON THE SHOOTER, THE BAD GUY.

4865
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:55,000
EVIL.

4866
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:56,000
>> EXACTLY.
>> Brian: RIGHT, BUT IN TERMS

4867
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
OF HAVING A GLOCK AND ANOTHER

4868
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:01,000
WEAPON, I'M NOT A BIG GUN GUY,

4869
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:02,000
I DON'T KNOW--

4870
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
ANDED BIG GAME RIFLE IF I TOLD

4871
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:07,000
YOU THEY WERE LOCATED IN

4872
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:08,000
CONNECTICUT, DOES THAT REMIND

4873
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:11,000
YOU OF SOMETHING, A TYPICAL OF

4874
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:14,000
CONNECTICUT.
>> I'M SURE THERE'S HUNTERS IN

4875
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:15,000
CONNECTICUT.

4876
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:16,000
>> Steve: THEY'RE LEGAL GUNS.

4877
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:17,000
>> THE WEAPONS ARE LEGAL THE

4878
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:20,000
MERE FACT THAT THIS KID HAD

4879
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
ACCESS TO THESE WEAPONS, ALL

4880
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:23,000
RIGHT, IF HE HAD SOME KIND OF

4881
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM IS A

4882
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
PROBLEM FOR ME.
HOW COME THE GUNS WEREN'T

4883
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
LOCKED UP.
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THEY

4884
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:30,000
WERE OR WEREN'T.

4885
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
>> HE LIVED IN THE HOUSE WITH

4886
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:35,000
HIS MOTHER.
>> AND PROBABLY REGISTERED TO

4887
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:36,000
HIS MOM AND THESE ARE

4888
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
QUESTIONS NA NEED TO BE

4889
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
ANSWERED AND SOMEBODY WHO BY

4890
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
MANY ACCOUNTS TODAY DOES SEEM

4891
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:43,000
TO HAVE BEEN MENTALLY

4892
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
DISTURBED AND HIS BROTHER

4893
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:46,000
DESCRIBED A PERSONALITY

4894
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:47,000
DISORDER, WHY HE WOULD HAVE

4895
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:51,000
ACCESS TO THESE AND THAT WOULD

4896
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
MEAN--
AN INVESTIGATION WOULD START.

4897
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:54,000
>> THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT

4898
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:55,000
OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS

4899
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:56,000
AND TRYING TO FIND OUT WHY

4900
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:57,000
THIS HAPPENED.

4901
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:00,000
I MEAN THIS, GUY, IT WILL BE A

4902
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
NOTE, DID HE HAVE A MANIFESTO,

4903
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:03,000
ALL RIGHT?

4904
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:04,000
AND YOU KNOW, ALL THE

4905
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:05,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS AND

4906
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
PSYCHIATRISTS ARE GOING TO

4907
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:08,000
LOOK AT THIS AND TRY TO--

4908
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
IF THIS GUY DIDN'T LEAVE A

4909
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:15,000
NOTE, ALL RIGHT, IF THERE

4910
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:20,000
WASN'T ANY SIGN, BUT I'M SURE

4911
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:21,000
THERE WERE SIGNS THIS GUY WAS

4912
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:22,000
A LUNATIC?

4913
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:23,000
ARE WE GOING TO KNOW WHY THE
MAN DID THIS.

4914
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:24,000
HE'S DEAD NOW.

4915
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
>> Brian: IF YOU'RE A FIRST

4916
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:30,000
TIME KILLER, AND WERE DRUGS

4917
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:31,000
INVOLVED?

4918
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:32,000
WERE YOU ALMOST A WALKING

4919
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
ZOMBIE, THAT OUT OF YOUR MIND.

4920
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
WOULD THAT SURPRISE YOU THERE

4921
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:39,000
WERE LEGAL DRUGS INVOLVED?

4922
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:40,000
>> THAT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME,

4923
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:43,000
APPARENTLY HAD SOME TYPES OF

4924
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:44,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES AND ON

4925
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
SOME TYPE OF MEDICATION, MAYBE

4926
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:47,000
THE MEDICATION M A SIDE

4927
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
EFFECTS FOR HIM TO ACT LIKE A

4928
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
COMPLETE LUNATIC AND DO

4929
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

4930
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:56,000
THE MERE FACT THAT THIS GUY

4931
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:57,000
WOKE UP THAT MORNING AND SHOT

4932
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
HIS MOTHER AND DECIDED TO GO

4933
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:02,000
TO THE SCHOOL AND KILL

4934
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
CHILDREN, IT'S JUST BEYOND--

4935
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:05,000
PREMEDITATED OR NOT.

4936
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:06,000
>> I THINK IT'S PRE HE

4937
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:07,000
MEDITATED.

4938
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
I DON'T THINK HE JUST WOKE UP

4939
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
THAT MORNING, HE HAD THE WHOLE

4940
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
OUTFIT, HE HAD THE WEAPONS AND

4941
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:14,000
WOKE UP.

4942
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:15,000
AND FORETHOUGHT TO SHOOT HIS

4943
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
MOTHER, GETS IN HIS CAR AND

4944
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
MAKE HIS WAY TO THE SCHOOL AND

4945
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:22,000
WHAT I THINK BROKE GLASS TO

4946
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:23,000
GET INTO THE SCHOOL.

4947
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
ALL RIGHT?
AND JUST WENT TO THE OFFICE

4948
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
AND SHOTS UP THE OFFICE WITH

4949
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:28,000
THE TEACHERS THERE AND THEN HE

4950
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:32,000
SAID, WELL, LET ME GO TO A

4951
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:35,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM OR
CLASS AND SHOOT SOME CHILDREN,

4952
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:36,000
I MEAN.
>> AND HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE

4953
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:37,000
WAS DOING.

4954
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:38,000
>> I THINK HE KNEW EXACTLY

4955
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:41,000
WHAT HE WAS DOING.
>> AND THE FACT THAT HE HAD TO

4956
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
BREAK THE GLASS TO GET INTO

4957
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:44,000
THE SCHOOL AND SO MANY--

4958
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
WE TALKED A LITTLE AGO,

4959
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:47,000
APPARENTLY SOMEBODY IN THE

4960
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:48,000
OFFICE PUSHED DOWN THE BUTTON

4961
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
ON THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM

4962
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:51,000
AND PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE

4963
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:54,000
BUILDING HEARD A SCREAM AND

4964
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:55,000
GUNSHOTS AND STARTED LOCKING

4965
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
DOORS AND THEN, YOU SALUTE

4966
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:58,000
SOME OF THE TEACHERS AS HEROES

4967
02:57:58,000 --> 02:57:59,000
BECAUSE THEY DID EXACTLY THE

4968
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:00,000
RIGHT THING.

4969
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
IN THE FACE AFTER GUY WITH A

4970
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
BUNCH OF GUNS.

4971
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:05,000
>> YEAH.

4972
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
>> AND THEY STEPPED UP.
>> AN EVIL MAN WITH GUNS.

4973
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
>> RIGHT.

4974
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:10,000
>> Brian: WHAT SHOULD SCHOOLS

4975
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:13,000
ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY -- THIS

4976
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:14,000
HAPPENED IN AN INNER CITY

4977
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:17,000
THEY'D GO WELL, THAT'S WHY

4978
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:18,000
THEY HAVE MEDAL DETECTORS AND

4979
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:19,000
SECURITY AND JOE CLARK,

4980
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
EVERYTHING HE DID TO REIN IN A

4981
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:22,000
BAD AREA AND TURN AROUND A

4982
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,000
COMMUNITY.

4983
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:24,000
WITH IT HAPPENING IN NEWTOWN,

4984
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
CONNECTICUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE

4985
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:29,000
ARE GOING TO RESPOND AND

4986
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:30,000
PRINCIPALS ARE GOING TO BE
RESPOND AND THEY MIGHT BE

4987
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
HAVING MEETINGS TODAY.

4988
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:33,000
WHAT WOULD YOU HOPE THEY TAKE

4989
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
OUT OF THE MEETINGS?

4990
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:36,000
>> WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK AND

4991
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
TAKE A LOOK HOW EVERYTHING

4992
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:39,000
HAPPENED.

4993
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:42,000
ALL RIGHT?
IT APPEARS TO ME, HE HAD TO

4994
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
BREAK THE GLASS TO GET IN.

4995
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
AEN SO MAYBE THEY NEED TO

4996
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
REINFORCE THE DOOR GLASS AND

4997
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:49,000
IF THIS GUY COULDN'T HAVE

4998
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:50,000
GOTTEN OUT OF THE BUILDING,

4999
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,000
THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED

5000
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:53,000
AND THE POLICE MIGHT RESPOND

5001
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
IF THEY SAW SOMEBODY OUTSIDE

5002
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:56,000
AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE

5003
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:57,000
TRAGEDY THAT WE HAD TODAY.

5004
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:58,000
ALL RIGHT?

5005
02:58:58,000 --> 02:58:59,000
AND WE ALSO PROBABLY NEED TO

5006
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:00,000
REINFORCE THE CLASSROOMS A

5007
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:01,000
LITTLE BIT.

5008
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:04,000
YEAH, AND THAT'S PRETTY COST

5009
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:07,000
EFFECTIVE.
>> AND RIGHT, EXACTLY, AND

5010
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
MAKE IT A SAFE ROOM AND PUT

5011
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
SOME REALLY GOOD DOORS LIKE I

5012
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:12,000
SAID THE FIRST TWO OR THREE

5013
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:13,000
MINUTES ARE MOST IMPORTANT AND

5014
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
WHEN MOST THE KILLING IS DONE.

5015
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:16,000
WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD

5016
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,000
OFF THAT GUY FOR A POLICE

5017
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
RESPONSE TIME.
IF WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT, WE

5018
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:21,000
COULD SAVE LIFERS.

5019
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
>> OF COURSE, YOU'RE

5020
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:24,000
SUGGESTING SECURITY EXPERT.

5021
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:25,000
>> CORRECT.

5022
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
>> Alisyn: AND OUR DOCTORS AND

5023
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
PSYCHOLOGIST HAVE TOLD US,

5024
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
COVERAGE MORE AND MORE SADLY,

5025
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:34,000
TRAGICALLY ON THE NEWS, IT'S

5026
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:35,000
EXTREMELY RARE SO TO HAVE

5027
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
EVERY SCHOOL BEEFING UP THE

5028
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
SECURITY AND REINFORCED GLASS,

5029
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
IS THAT THE RIGHT THING OR

5030
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
WILL BAD GUYS ALWAYS FIND--

5031
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:44,000
>> FIGURE A WAY IN.

5032
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:47,000
>> FIGURE A WAY IN.

5033
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:48,000
>> THE TARGET.

5034
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:49,000
>> THEY SPECIFICALLY GO FOR A

5035
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
SOFT TARGET, AN UNPROTECTED

5036
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:52,000
TARGET.

5037
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:53,000
SO, MAYBE, IN GUY WENT

5038
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:54,000
SPECIFICALLY TO THIS SCHOOL

5039
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:55,000
BECAUSE OF WHAT I AM A HEARING

5040
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
FROM SOME OF THE PEOPLE YOU

5041
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:58,000
HAVE SPEAKING HERE, BECAUSE HE

5042
02:59:58,000 --> 02:59:59,000
HAD SOME KIND OF CONNECTION

5043
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:00,000
WITH THAT SCHOOL WITH THE

5044
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
MOTHER.

5045
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:03,000
ALL RIGHT?
SO THEREFORE, THIS WAS HIS

5046
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:04,000
TARGET.

5047
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:05,000
IF HE COULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN IN

5048
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
THERE, WHERE WAS HE GOING TO

5049
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:08,000
GO FROM THERE?

5050
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:09,000
SHOT HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE

5051
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:10,000
SCHOOL?

5052
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:11,000
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T HAVE A

5053
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:12,000
CRYSTAL BALL, BUT THE WHOLE

5054
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:15,000
THING, NOW, IS THAT THE SCHOOL

5055
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
SHOULD TAKE SOME TYPE OF

5056
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:18,000
ACTION AT LEAST SOMETHING, YOU

5057
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:19,000
KNOW?

5058
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:20,000
IF NOT APPARENTLY THIS SCHOOL

5059
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,000
LOOKS LIKE IT WAS VERY

5060
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:23,000
PREPARED, AND THE TEACHERS

5061
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:26,000
REALLY KNEW HOW TO REACT.

5062
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:30,000
>> IT'S A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD.

5063
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
AND CUTTING BUDGETS AND AREN'T

5064
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,000
LOOKING TO BOLSTER THE GLASS

5065
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:36,000
AND THE KIDS, MIGHT NOT

5066
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:37,000
HAPPEN.

5067
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000

ALL RIGHT IT'S NINE O'CLOCK IN

5071
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
NEW YORK CITY.

5072
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
>> WE BEGIN THE HOUR WE'RE

5073
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:54,000
AWAITING A LIVE PRESS

5074
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:55,000
CONFERENCE OUT OF NEWTOWN,

5075
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
CONNECTICUT AND EXPECT TO

5076
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:58,000
LEARN NEW DETAILS ABOUT THE

5077
03:00:58,000 --> 03:00:59,000
VICTIMS IN THE HORRIBLE

5078
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:00,000
TRAGICER AND THE SHOOTER WHO

5079
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:03,000
TOOK THE LIVES OF 26 PEOPLE.

5080
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:04,000
INCLUDING 20 CHILDREN.

5081
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:05,000
AS YOU SEE, EVERYONE THOUGHT

5082
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
IT WAS GOING TO START AN HOUR

5083
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:08,000
AGO, WE'RE GOING LIVE TO THE

5084
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:09,000
PRESSER AS SOON AS IT STARTS,

5085
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:12,000
THIS IS UNFOLDING, A VERY LIVE

5086
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:13,000
INVESTIGATION, A LOT OF MOVING

5087
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:14,000
PARTS AND I IMAGINE IT'S GOING

5088
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
TO BE SUBSTANTIVE AND THAT'S

5089
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:17,000
WHAT WE'RE WAITING FOR,

5090
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
BECAUSE THEY COULD SEE

5091
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:20,000
THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS OF THE

5092
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:21,000
NATIONAL PRESS.

5093
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
I ALSO SEE THAT THERE'S PRIME

5094
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:24,000
MINISTERS AND PRESIDENTS FROM

5095
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:25,000
AROUND THE GLOBE REACHING OUT

5096
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
AND EXPRESSING THEIR SUPPORT

5097
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:30,000
IN AMERICA AND THE HORROR OVER

03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:33,000

AUSTRALIA.

5101
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:37,000
>> Steve: IT HAPPENED 23 HOURS

5102
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:40,000
AND 30 MINUTES AGO WHEN ADAM

03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,000
LANZA, 20 YEARS OLDS WALKED

5104
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:45,000
INTO NA SCHOOL AFTER HE BROKE

5105
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:49,000
THE GLASS OUT AFTER HE

5106
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:50,000
MURDERED HIS MOTHER AND SHOT

5107
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:52,000
DEAD 20 CHILDREN AND SIX

5108
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:53,000
ADULTS AND HEARD GREAT STORIES

5109
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:54,000
OF HEROISM.

5110
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:56,000
THINGS THAT TEACHERS AND

THE THINGS THAT THEY DID, A

5114
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,000
LOT OF THEM DID THE RIGHT

5115
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,000
STUFF.
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS WAS A GUY

5116
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
INTENT ON KILLING.

5117
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:07,000
>> Alisyn: WE'LL GET TO THE
STORIES ABOUT THE TEACHERS AND

5118
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
THE STUDENTS THERE, BUT FIRST

5119
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT WHO ADAM

5120
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
LANZA IS, BECAUSE OF COURSE,

5121
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:14,000
EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW IF

5122
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:15,000
THERE WAS A SPARK, A SIGN

5123
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:16,000
WHERE SOMEBODY COULD HAVE SEEN

5124
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
WHAT WAS GOING TO COME.

5125
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:19,000
HE'S 20 YEARS OLD.

5126
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:20,000
PARENTS DIVORCED IN 2009.

5127
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:23,000
HE'S LIVED ALONE WITH HIS

5128
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:28,000
MOTHER IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT

5129
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:33,000

RYAN, LIVED IN HOBOKEN.

5133
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:45,000
HE BELIEVED HIS BROTHER WAS

5134
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:48,000
SOMEWHERE ON THE AUTISM

5135
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:53,000
SPECTRUM, MIGHT HAVE HAD AS

5136
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:58,000
PERFECTI

5137
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
PERFECTI

5138
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,000
ASPERGER'S.
AND HE WAS A COMPUTER NERD AND

5139
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,000
LOVE VIDEO TECHNOLOGY.

5140
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:06,000
>> GAMER.

5141
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:10,000
>> Alisyn: SOME NUMBERS SAID

5142
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
STRANGE.
>> FOUND HIM STRANGE.

5143
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
AS EARLY AS 7TH GRADE WE USED

5144
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
TO CARRY KNAPSACKS TO SCHOOL

5145
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,000
AND HE'D CARRY A BRIEFCASE AND

5146
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,000
HE WAS PAINFULLY SHOW AND

5147
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:21,000
FEARED SOMEBODY MIGHT TALK TO

5148
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:22,000
HIM.

5149
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:24,000
AND A QUOTE THAT STOOD OUT TO

5150
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:25,000
ME IN THE DAILY NEWS, ONE OF

5151
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
THE CLASSMATES WHO HAPPENS TO

5152
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:29,000
BE HIS NEIGHBOR NOW, AS

5153
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:30,000
HORRIBLE AS THIS IS, I CAN'T

5154
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
SAY I AM SURPRISED.

5155
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:33,000
HE SHOULD BURN IN HELL.

5156
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:34,000
SO I CAN'T SAY I'M SURPRISED

5157
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,000
INDICATES THAT NOT ONLY WAS

5158
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
THIS GUY BASICALLY SHY, BUT

5159
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:39,000
PAINFULLY DANGEROUS.

5160
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:40,000
>> Steve: AND HE LOOKED

5161
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:41,000
DANGEROUS YESTERDAY WHEN HE

5162
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:45,000
ARRIVED AT THE SCHOOL, BLACK

5163
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:49,000
CAMOUFLAGE AND SEMI AUTOMATIC

5164
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
PISTOLS AND RIFFLE AS WELL.

5165
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:53,000
JUST IMAGINE IF YOU LIVED

5166
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,000
NEARBY AND YOUR SISTER IS IS

5167
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:57,000
IN THE THIRD OR FOURTH GRADE

5168
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:58,000
AT THAT SCHOOL AND YOU HEAR

5169
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:00,000
GUNSHOTS.

5170
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
WELL, THAT WAS THE STORY OF A

5171
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
YOUNG MAN WHO'S, YOU KNOW,

5172
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
BROTHER TO A LITTLE GIRL WHO

5173
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:07,000
WENT TO THAT SCHOOL.

5174
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:08,000
HE HEARD THE GUNSHOTS

5175
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
YESTERDAY AT ABOUT THIS TIME

5176
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:12,000
AND RAN FOR THE SCHOOL TO SEE

5177
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:13,000
IF HIS SISTER WAS OKAY.

5178
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:16,000
HE JOINED US ABOUT TWO HOURS

5179
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:17,000
AGO RIGHT HERE ON "FOX &

5180
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
FRIENDS" AND HERE IS A LOOK AT

5181
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:20,000
THEIR STORY.

5182
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:23,000
>> SHE WAS IN ART CLASS AND

5183
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,000
THE INTERCOM CAME ON, WHERE

5184
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:27,000
SHE HEARD A SCREAM AND A

5185
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:28,000
BULLET.

5186
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:29,000
AND THAT'S WHEN THE SCHOOL

5187
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:32,000
WENT INTO LOCKDOWN AND WHAT

5188
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:33,000
ULTIMATELY HAPPENED WAS

5189
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:34,000
BECAUSE SHE WAS IN THE ART

5190
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:35,000
CLASS, THEY LOCKED THE DOORS,

5191
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:36,000
BUT ONE OF THE DOORS IN THE

5192
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:38,000
ART CLASS DID NOT LOCK

5193
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:41,000
ACCORDING TO WHAT SHE SAID.

5194
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:42,000
SO, YEAH, SO THEY HAD TO GO

5195
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:44,000
INTO SOME SORT OF SMALL ROOM,

5196
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
A CLOSET, I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE

5197
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:47,000
HOW SHE DETAIL IT HAD, BUT

5198
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,000
THEY HAD TO GO INTO A SMALL

5199
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:50,000
ROOM AND STAY QUIET.

5200
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:53,000
>> Alisyn: AND HE WAS HAPPY TO

5201
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:54,000
REPORT THAT HIS SISTER WAS

5202
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:56,000
OKAY AND OBVIOUSLY, VERY

5203
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,000
SHAKEN UP AND THE LONG-TERM

5204
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
RAMIFICATIONS WILL BE WITH

5205
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
THIS.
WE HAD GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE

5206
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
ON A SHORT TIME AGO AND HE'S

5207
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:05,000
TAKING HEAT ONLINE ON THE

5208
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
INTERNET AND HE CAME OUT AND

5209
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:08,000
SAID PART THIS HAVE IS BECAUSE

5210
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:12,000
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RELIGION

5211
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
IN OUR CULTURE.

5212
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:17,000
HE WAS EXPLAINED ABOUT WHAT HE

5213
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
THINKS ABOUT OUR CULTURE AND

5214
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:22,000
HOW IT COULD LEAD TO THIS.

5215
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:23,000
AND KEEP IT HERE.

5216
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:24,000
>> YESTERDAY I WAS ON NEIL

5217
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,000
CAVUTO AND HE ASKED ME, NOW

5218
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:30,000
WHERE WAS GOD AND I SAID WE'VE

5219
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:31,000
SYSTEMATICALLY REMOVED HIM

5220
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:34,000
FROM OUR CULTURE AND FROM OUR

5221
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:37,000
SCHOOLS AND I'VE BEEN BARRAGED

5222
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:42,000
BY PEOPLE WHO SAID IF WE'VE

5223
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:43,000
H

5224
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:46,000
HAD--
IF WE AS A CULTURES DECIDE WE

5225
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,000
DON'T WANT VALUES AND SAY SOME

5226
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:49,000
THINGS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT,

5227
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:50,000
ALWAYS WRONG.

5228
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:51,000
WHEN WE DIVORCE OURSELVES FROM

5229
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:54,000
A BASIC SENSE OF WHAT WE WOULD

5230
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:57,000
CALL, I WOULD SAY COLLECTIVE

5231
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,000
MORALITY WE AGREE ON CERTAIN

5232
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:00,000
PRINCIPLES TO BE TRUE ALWAYS,

5233
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
THEN WE CREATE A CULTURE, NOT

5234
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:03,000
THAT IT SPECIFICALLY CREATES

5235
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:04,000
THIS CRIME, IT DOESN'T.

5236
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:06,000
BUT IT CREATES AN ATMOSPHERE

5237
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:09,000
IN WHICH EVIL AND VIOLENCE ARE

5238
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:12,000
REMOVED FROM OUR SENSE OF

5239
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:13,000
RESPONSIBILITIES.

5240
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:16,000
>> Brian: THERE WAS A LOT OF
VALUES AND A LOT OF GREAT

5241
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:17,000
ACTION UNDER PRESSURE THAT WE

5242
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:18,000
DID SEE YESTERDAY.

5243
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:19,000
BECAUSE THEY WERE PRESSED INTO

5244
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:22,000
ACTION.
THE TOWN OF NEWTOWN, I FIND

5245
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:23,000
FASCINATING.

5246
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:24,000
IT'S ABOUT 20,000 PEOPLE

5247
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,000
THERE, 25,000 PEOPLE, ONLY 60

5248
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
SQUARE MILES, IT'S A

5249
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000
RELATIVELY AFFLUENT COMMUNITY.

5250
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:31,000
108,000 IS THE AVERAGE INCOME

5251
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:32,000
THERE.

5252
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,000
45% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS INCLUDE

5253
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:35,000
KIDS UNDER 18 AND WHEN YOU

5254
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:37,000
TALK ABOUT ANCILLARY DAMAGE

5255
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:41,000
AND COLLATERAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL

5256
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,000
DAMAGE A LOT OF FAMILIES

5257
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:44,000
EXPLAINING TO DO AND

5258
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:46,000
TWO-THIRDS OF THE RESIDENTS

5259
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:47,000
ARE UNDERAGE 44.

5260
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:48,000
YOUNG EMERGING.

5261
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:49,000
>> Alisyn: YOU MOVE THERE

5262
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
BECAUSE YOU HAVE KIDS THERE

5263
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:52,000
AND WANT TO GO TO THE SCHOOLS

5264
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:54,000
AND DEDICATED TEACHERS AND

5265
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:55,000
PRINCIPALS LIKE THE ONES WE

5266
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:56,000
SAW YESTERDAY AND KNOW YOUR

5267
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,000
KIDS WILL BE SAFE FOR THAT,

5268
03:06:58,000 --> 03:06:59,000
AND WHEN YOU SEND THEM OFF TO

5269
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
SCHOOL IN THE MORNING AND THEY

5270
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:02,000
GO TO KINDERGARTEN.

5271
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,000
>> THERE'S A GREAT COLUMN IN

5272
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:05,000
THE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS THIS

5273
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:07,000
MORNING AND ONE OF THE

5274
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:08,000
COLUMNISTS WENT OVER TO THE

5275
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:11,000
BLUE COLONY DINER THERE IN

5276
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:14,000
NEWTOWN AND A WAITRESS TOLD A

5277
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:15,000
SORRY SHE WAS TALKING TO ONE

5278
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:16,000
OF HER REGULAR CUSTOMERS WHO

5279
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:19,000
HAD BEEN TALKING TO HIS GOOD

5280
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:23,000
FRIEND WHOSE CHILD WAS

5281
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:24,000
MURDERED YESTERDAY AND HE SAID

5282
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:26,000
HIS BUDDY WAS UNCONSOLABLE,

5283
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:27,000
OBVIOUSLY, DIDN'T WANT TO GO

5284
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:29,000
ON LIVING, SAID HE WANTED TO

5285
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:30,000
JUMP OFF A BRIDGE AND DIDN'T

5286
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:33,000
WANT TO LIVE ANYMORE WITHOUT

5287
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:34,000
HIS LITTLE GIRL ESPECIALLY AT

5288
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:35,000
CHRISTMAS TIME.

5289
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:37,000
THAT DAD JUST WANTED TO DIE.

5290
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:38,000
>> Brian: RIGHT, INSTEAD OF

5291
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:39,000
GOING OUT AND SHOPPING FOR

5292
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:40,000
CHRISTMAS PRESENTS, A LOT OF

5293
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:41,000
THE FAMILIES ARE SHOPPING FOR

5294
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:42,000
SOMETHING TO BURY THEIR

5295
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:44,000
CHILDREN IN AND IT'S

5296
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:45,000
UNBELIEVABLE THE CHANNING OF

5297
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:48,000
EVENTS AND HOW QUICK SOMETHING

5298
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:51,000
COULD TURN AROUND.

5299
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:52,000
>> Alisyn: WHEN GOVERNOR

5300
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:53,000
HUCKABEE WAS ON AND TALKING

5301
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:54,000
ABOUT THE CULTURE.

5302
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:55,000
IT HEARTS TO MAKE SENSE THAT

5303
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:57,000
IT HAPPENS.

5304
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,000
WE KNOW THAT IT HAPPENS IN THE

5305
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:00,000
UNITED STATES MORE AND

5306
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:01,000
ELSEWHERE, SOMETHING IS

5307
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:02,000
HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES

5308
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:03,000
WITH SCHOOL SHOOTINGS.

5309
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:04,000
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS WE TALKED

5310
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,000
ABOUT WITH GOVERNOR HUCKABEE

5311
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:09,000
IN 1998 JONESBORO, ARKANSAS,

5312
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:10,000
EVERYBODY REMEMBERS THAT ONE.

5313
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:12,000
IT FELT LIKE SOMETHING UNUSUAL

5314
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:13,000
THAT WAS SHOCKING AND IN THOSE

5315
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:16,000
20 YEARS, YOU KNOW, THAT HAVE

5316
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:17,000
PASSED, 15 YEARS, IT SEEMS

5317
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:22,000
THAT THERE'S MORE AND MORE R

5318
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:24,000
PREVALENT.

5319
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:25,000
THE CONVERSATION HAS TO BEGIN

5320
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:26,000
ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING THAT

5321
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:28,000
MAKES PRIMARILY YOUNG BOYS,

5322
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:30,000
THEY WERE THAT ONE IN

5323
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:32,000
ARKANSAS, AND ADAM YESTERDAY

5324
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:34,000
LANZA WAS 20 YEARS OLD AND

5325
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:35,000
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING WITH

5326
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:39,000
YOUNG MEN, YOUNG BOYS AND

5327
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:40,000
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS.

5328
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:44,000
>> IN THAT CASE, IN ARKANSAS,

5329
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:46,000
PERHAPS PARENTING.

5330
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:47,000
>> PERHAPS CULTURE.

5331
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:50,000
>> AND ROD WHEELER CONTINUES

5332
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:54,000
WITH US NOW.

5333
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:57,000
ALI IS WRITE.

5334
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:58,000
IS IT THE CULTURE, THE GUNS,

5335
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:00,000
IS IT PARENTS?

5336
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:02,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY.

5337
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:04,000
>> I DO DON'T POLITICAL

5338
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:07,000
THINGS, GUNS DON'T KILL

5339
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:08,000
PEOPLE, PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE AND

5340
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:09,000
KNIVES--

5341
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:10,000
I DON'T THINK IT'S TIME TO

5342
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:12,000
FOCUS ON THAT TYPE OF A

5343
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:13,000
SITUATION.

5344
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:14,000
WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON IS

5345
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:15,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH IN THIS

5346
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:16,000
COUNTRY.

5347
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:17,000
WE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE

5348
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:19,000
GOING TO CONTINUE TO RESPOND

5349
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:20,000
AND TEACHERS ARE GOING TO

5350
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:23,000
CONTINUE TO TEACH AND SCHOOLS

5351
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:25,000
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO

5352
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:26,000
TO--
STUDENTS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE

5353
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:29,000
TO GO TO SCHOOLS.

5354
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:32,000
THE SCHOOLS ARE SAFE AND

5355
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:35,000
TEACHERS PREPARE FOR THESE

5356
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:37,000
TYPE OF HORRIFIC EVENTS TO

5357
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:38,000
GUARD AGAINST WHAT THAT SCHOOL

5358
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:43,000
TEACHER DID YESTERDAY, A HERO

5359
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:44,000
DEFINITELY.
I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE

5360
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:45,000
TO POINT THE FINGER RIGHT NOW

5361
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:46,000
SAYING THIS IS THE CAUSE.

5362
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:48,000
I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS

5363
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:50,000
START ADDRESSING SOME PERSONAL

5364
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:51,000
ISSUES THAT PEOPLE MAY BE

5365
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:54,000
HAVING.
>> ROD, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

5366
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:57,000
WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY DANGEROUS

5367
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:59,000
PEOPLE AND HOW DO YOU DO THAT

5368
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:02,000
WITHOUT INFRINGING ON PEOPLE'S

5369
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:03,000
PERSONAL RIGHTS?

5370
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:04,000
>> THAT'S INTERESTING, BRIAN,

5371
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:06,000
YOU ASKED ME EARLY.

5372
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:07,000
AND I GET ASKED THAT A LOT.

5373
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:09,000
AND SOME PEOPLE SAY, ISN'T

5374
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:10,000
THAT PROFILING?

5375
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:12,000
IN 2012 WE CAN'T WORRY ABOUT

5376
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:13,000
THAT.

5377
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:15,000
IF YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL AND

5378
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:16,000
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT, THAT'S

5379
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:17,000
SHOWING SIGNS, THEY'RE

5380
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:19,000
ISOLATED FROM EVERYBODY ELSE,

5381
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:20,000
AND MAKING STRANGE COMMENTS

5382
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:22,000
AND A CONNECTION WITH WEAPONS.

5383
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:23,000
LOOK, DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,

5384
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:24,000
BUT YOU HAVE TO LET SOMEBODY

5385
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:25,000
KNOW THAT.

5386
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:30,000
LET THE EXPERTS COME IN AND

5387
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:32,000
POLICE DEPARTMENTS,

5388
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:33,000
COUNSELORS, TALK WITH THE

5389
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:34,000
PERSONS AND THESE ARE THE

5390
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:35,000
INDIVIDUALS COMMITTING THE
ACTS AND AT THE SAME TIME WE

5391
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:37,000
HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO KEEP OUR

5392
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:38,000
SCHOOL SAFE AND I THINK

5393
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:39,000
THEY'RE RELATIVELY SAFE, GUYS.

5394
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:41,000
>> OF COURSE, OF COURSE, AND

5395
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:43,000
JUST THE--

5396
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:44,000
AND AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS THAT

5397
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:47,000
STRIKES AT THE HEART OF THE

5398
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:48,000
COUNTRIES, BECAUSE IT IS SO

5399
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:50,000
UNUSUAL AND JUST WHEN YOU

5400
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:52,000
THINK YOU CAN NEVER HEAR

5401
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:53,000
SOMETHING MORE HORRIFYING THAN

5402
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:55,000
VIRGINIA TECH, MORE THAN

5403
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:57,000
COLUMBINE, THE IDEA THAT THIS

5404
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:00,000
ONE IS EVEN BECAUSE OF THE--

5405
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:01,000
THAT THEY WERE

5406
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:02,000
KINDERGARTENERS, THEY WERE

5407
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:03,000
FIVE YEARS OLD, THEY WERE SIX

5408
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:06,000
YEARS OLD, SOMEHOW, A CRAZED

5409
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:08,000
GUNMAN CAN FIND SOMETHING

5410
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:09,000
THAT'S MORE EVIL AND HORRIBLE.

5411
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:10,000
>> AND THERE'S A STORY OUT

5412
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:12,000
THERE, ROD, THAT SAYS THAT

5413
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:14,000
THIS YOUNG ADAM APPARENTLY

5414
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:15,000
SUFFERED--

5415
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:17,000
HAD SOME SORT OF PERSONALITY

5416
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:18,000
DISORDER, BUT ONE OF THE

5417
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:19,000
NEWSPAPERS TODAY IS SAYING

5418
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:21,000
THAT HE HAD A CONDITION WHERE

5419
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:22,000
HE COULD NOT FEEL PAIN.

5420
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:23,000
AND THERE'S A PICTURES OF HIM

5421
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:25,000
WHEN HE WAS A YOUNGER MAN.

5422
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:27,000
AND IN FACT, WHEN HE WAS ON

5423
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:28,000
THE BASEBALL TEAM THEY REPORT,

5424
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:30,000
EVERYBODY HAD TO BE CAREFUL,

5425
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:31,000
HE DIDN'T FALL BECAUSE HE

5426
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:34,000
COULD GET HURT AND NOT FEEL

5427
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:35,000

03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:22,000
MOVED LAST NIGHT.

5606
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:24,000
>> IN THE FIREHOUSE WHERE THEY

5607
03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:27,000
WERE AMASSING AND FOR THEM,

5608
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:29,000
COME ON, WE KNOW MY CHILD IS

5609
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:30,000
DEAD, WHY DO I HAVE TO WAIT.

5610
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:32,000
>> WELL, THEY HAVE TO IDENTIFY

5611
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:34,000
EACH CHILD TO MAKE SURE THE

5612
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:35,000
WRONG CHILD DOESN'T GO AND NOW

5613
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:39,000
THAT THAT'S BEEN DONE, THEY'LL

5614
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:40,000
SOON HAVE THE BODIES BECAUSE

5615
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:41,000
THE BODIES HAVE TO BE

5616
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:42,000
EXAMINED.

5617
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:43,000
>> AND THE MEDICAL EXAMINER?

5618
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:45,000
>> AND THAT WILL BE WHERE

5619
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:48,000
THEY'D BE AND RELEASED FROM

5620
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:50,000
THERE IS THE USUAL WAY IT'S

5621
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:51,000
DONE, UNLESS THEY HAD X-RAY

5622
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:53,000
FACILITIES BROUGHT DOWN TO THE

5623
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:55,000
SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY WANT TO

5624
03:18:55,000 --> 03:18:56,000
REMOVE THE BULLETS.

5625
03:18:56,000 --> 03:18:57,000
>> Alisyn: DR. BADEN,

5626
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:58,000
EVERYTHING YOU'RE TALKING

5627
03:18:58,000 --> 03:19:00,000
ABOUT IS SO TECHNICAL AND IT'S

5628
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:02,000
SO, KIND OF CLINICAL AND

5629
03:19:02,000 --> 03:19:04,000
MEDICAL, I KNOW THAT'S YOUR

5630
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:06,000
JOB, BUT THIS IS ABOUT THE

5631
03:19:06,000 --> 03:19:08,000
HEART BREAK OF PARENTS AND

5632
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:09,000
PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT WE

5633
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:10,000
KNOW WHO THE SHOOTER WAS,

5634
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:11,000
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A

5635
03:19:11,000 --> 03:19:12,000
TRIAL FOR THE SHOOTER BECAUSE

5636
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:14,000
HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.

5637
03:19:14,000 --> 03:19:15,000
YOU HAVE POINTED OUT THAT

5638
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:17,000
THERE WILL STILL BE TRIALS

5639
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:18,000
BECAUSE YOU PREDICT, HAVING

5640
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:20,000
BEEN AROUND THINGS LIKE THIS

5641
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:21,000
BEFORE.
>> RIGHT.

5642
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:23,000
>> Alisyn: THAT THERE WILL BE

5643
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:24,000
LAWSUITS, BUT ALSO SOUNDS LIKE

5644
03:19:24,000 --> 03:19:25,000
THE SCHOOL DID EVERYTHING

5645
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:27,000
RIGHT.
THEY DID HAVE SECURITY IN

5646
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:28,000
PLACE AND DID DO SAFETY DRILLS

5647
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:30,000
AND THE PRINCIPAL DID THE

5648
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:31,000
RIGHT THING.

5649
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:33,000
HOW, SOMETIMES HORRIBLE THINGS

5650
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:35,000
HAPPEN AND THERE'S NO LAWSUIT

5651
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:36,000
THAT'S GOING TO FIX IT.

5652
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:39,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT, BUT AT THE

5653
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:41,000
SAME TIME THE POLICE AND THE

5654
03:19:41,000 --> 03:19:43,000
MEDICAL EXAMINERS HAVE A

5655
03:19:43,000 --> 03:19:44,000
CERTAIN PROTOCOL THEY HAVE TO

5656
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:46,000
DOCUMENT BECAUSE THEY KNOW A

5657
03:19:46,000 --> 03:19:47,000
YEAR, TWO, THREE YEARS FROM

5658
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:49,000
NOW, ISSUES CAN COME UP AND IF

5659
03:19:49,000 --> 03:19:51,000
THEY HAVEN'T MADE THE

5660
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:52,000
DOCUMENTATION IT'S GOING TO BE

5661
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:53,000
WORSE FOR THE FAMILIES HAVING

5662
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:55,000
TO LIVE THROUGH IT AGAIN,

5663
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:58,000
HAVING TO EXHUME A BODY, FOR

5664
03:19:58,000 --> 03:19:59,000
EXAMPLE, WOULD BE TERRIBLE SO

5665
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:01,000
THEY HAVE TO GET EVERYTHING

5666
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:04,000
FROM THE REMAINS AS MUCH AS

5667
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:05,000
POSSIBLE AND THEN RELEASE THE

5668
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:07,000
BODY.
THE WAY THEY'RE DOING IT,

5669
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:08,000
THEY'RE DOING IT VERY QUICKLY

5670
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:11,000
AND HOPEFULLY, BOY MONDAY AND

5671
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:16,000
TUESDAY THERE'LL BE SOME--

5672
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:17,000
>> ISSUES.
>> BODIES RELEASED.

5673
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:18,000
>> Brian: AND DO YOU HAVE TO

5674
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:19,000
BRING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

5675
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:21,000

YOU SAID FARMINGTON IS WHERE

5676
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:22,000
THEY'RE GOING IN CONNECTICUT.

5677
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:23,000
ARE THEY GOING TO NEED SOME

5678
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:24,000
HELP?

5679
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:27,000
>> NO, NO, THE MEDICAL

5680
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:28,000
EXAMINERS ARE.

5681
03:20:28,000 --> 03:20:30,000
>> Brian: THEY HAVE HANDLE 26,

5682
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:33,000
28 PEOPLE?
>> YES, THEY CAN HANDLE IT.

5683
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:34,000
THE ISSUE OF HOMICIDE TO DO AT

5684
03:20:34,000 --> 03:20:36,000
THE SCHOOL, THEN THEY MIGHT

5685
03:20:36,000 --> 03:20:38,000
NEED EQUIPMENT, BUT THEY WILL

03:20:38,000 --> 03:20:39,000
EVERYTHING IN CONNECTICUT AS I

5687
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:40,000
SAID.

5688
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:41,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER, DR. KARR

5689
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:45,000

>> YOU KNOW, I STARTED TALKING

5779
03:26:37,000 --> 03:26:38,000

LOST MY BEST FRIEND.

5783
03:26:43,000 --> 03:26:44,000
AND I SAID TO HIM, YOU KNOW,

5784
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:46,000
THAT GOD'S GOING TO SEND YOU

5785
03:26:46,000 --> 03:26:48,000
SOME WONDERFUL NEW FRIENDS.

5786
03:26:48,000 --> 03:26:49,000

SISTER IN YOUR HEART AND I

03:26:53,000 --> 03:26:55,000
WORRY BECAUSE SHE'S VERY SAFE

5790
03:26:55,000 --> 03:26:56,000
BECAUSE SHE'S WITH GOD AND WE

5791
03:26:56,000 --> 03:26:58,000
TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT WHAT

5792
03:26:58,000 --> 03:26:59,000
HEAVEN WAS LIKE, AND HE

5793
03:26:59,000 --> 03:27:01,000
REALIZED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO

5794
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:03,000
BE HAPPEN, IF A SHE WAS GOING

5795
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:04,000
TO BE SAFE, BUT IT WAS SHORTLY

5796
03:27:04,000 --> 03:27:07,000
AFTER THIS, THAT HE BROKE DOWN

5797
03:27:07,000 --> 03:27:08,000
INTO TEARS.

5798
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:09,000
>> Reporter:  AND IT'S ABOUT

5799
03:27:09,000 --> 03:27:11,000
SAFETY AND LOVE AND I KNOW

5800
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:13,000
YOU'VE DECIDED AND PARISH HAS

5801
03:27:13,000 --> 03:27:15,000
DECIDED TO GO FORWARD WITH A

5802
03:27:15,000 --> 03:27:19,000
LIVE NATIVITY PAGEANT AND AT

5803
03:27:19,000 --> 03:27:20,000
5:30, A MAN WILL COME INTO THE

5804
03:27:20,000 --> 03:27:22,000
CHURCH AND STAY THAT THERE IS

5805
03:27:22,000 --> 03:27:24,000
A STAR OVER THE STABLE AND THE

5806
03:27:24,000 --> 03:27:26,000
CHURCH WILL PROCEED OUT TO THE

5807
03:27:26,000 --> 03:27:29,000
STABLE TO A LIVE NATIVITY

5808
03:27:29,000 --> 03:27:31,000
SCENE AND THIS TOWN WAS SO

5809
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:32,000
PROUD THEY WERE GETTING A

5810
03:27:32,000 --> 03:27:34,000
CAMEL FOR THE NATIVITY SCENE

5811
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:37,000
AND LOOK AT THE BABY JESUS,

5812
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:40,000
WHEN YOUR PARISHIONERS LOOK AT

5813
03:27:40,000 --> 03:27:45,000
THE BABY JESUS IN TKRESH.

5814
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:49,000
WHAT DOES IT SAY.

5815
03:27:49,000 --> 03:27:50,000
>> WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING FOR

5816
03:27:50,000 --> 03:27:52,000
ONE STAR, WE'LL LOOK FOR 20

5817
03:27:52,000 --> 03:27:53,000
STARS AND THE LIGHT SHINING

5818
03:27:53,000 --> 03:27:54,000
OVER CHRIST IS GOING TO SHINE

5819
03:27:54,000 --> 03:27:56,000
OVER THE FAMILY AS WELL.

5820
03:27:56,000 --> 03:27:58,000
AND THESE CHILDREN ARE ANGELS

5821
03:27:58,000 --> 03:27:59,000
NOW.

5822
03:27:59,000 --> 03:28:01,000
WHEN THEY REFLECT ON THE

5823
03:28:01,000 --> 03:28:04,000
CHRIST CHILD BORN HE DID BRING

5824
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:06,000
US HOPE IN THE WORST TIMES

5825
03:28:06,000 --> 03:28:07,000
HE'S EVER PRESENT TO US AND

CAN TAKE TONIGHT, THERE'S

5828
03:28:10,000 --> 03:28:12,000
STILL A REASON TO HOPE AND

5829
03:28:12,000 --> 03:28:15,000
LIVE ON AND FAMILIES OF OTHER

5830
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:16,000
CHILDREN THAT THEY HAVE TO

5831
03:28:16,000 --> 03:28:17,000
RAISE AND HOPING THAT THE

5832
03:28:17,000 --> 03:28:18,000
STRENGTH THAT COMES FROM THE

5833
03:28:18,000 --> 03:28:21,000
CHRIST CHILD WILL BE FOR THESE

5834
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:23,000
FAMILIES AND WITH THESE

5835
03:28:23,000 --> 03:28:24,000
PARENTS.
>> Reporter:  A TEACHER SAID

5836
03:28:24,000 --> 03:28:26,000
YESTERDAY, ONE OF THE CHILDREN

5837
03:28:26,000 --> 03:28:27,000
SAID AS SHE WAS PROTECTING

5838
03:28:27,000 --> 03:28:28,000
THEM FROM WHAT SHE BELIEVED TO

5839
03:28:28,000 --> 03:28:30,000
BE CERTAIN DEATH, I DON'T WANT

5840
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:33,000
TO DIE, I JUST WANT TO HAVE

5841
03:28:33,000 --> 03:28:34,000
CHRISTMAS.

5842
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:35,000
SO THE INNOCENCE OF THESE

5843
03:28:35,000 --> 03:28:38,000
CHILDREN ARE ARTICULATED IN

5844
03:28:38,000 --> 03:28:40,000
THAT STATEMENT.

5845
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:41,000
THIS IS A TOUGH THING FOR YOU

5846
03:28:41,000 --> 03:28:43,000
AND YOU'RE A STRONG MAN AND

5847
03:28:43,000 --> 03:28:45,000

HOW DO YOU STAY STRONG AND HOW

5853
03:28:53,000 --> 03:28:54,000
DO YOU GET THE MESSAGE OUT IN

5854
03:28:54,000 --> 03:28:55,000
A WAY THAT HELPS PEOPLE?

5855
03:28:55,000 --> 03:28:58,000
>> YOU KNOW, I'M TAKING A LOT

5856
03:28:58,000 --> 03:28:59,000
OF STRENGTH FROM THESE

5857
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:00,000
PARENTS.

5858
03:29:00,000 --> 03:29:02,000
YOU KNOW, IF--

5859
03:29:02,000 --> 03:29:04,000
AS I WAS WEARING THEM SIT

5860
03:29:04,000 --> 03:29:06,000
THERE YESTERDAY AND THEY WERE

5861
03:29:06,000 --> 03:29:07,000
BREAKING DOWN AND HORRIBLE

5862
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:09,000
MOMENTS THERE WAS SUCH A BOND

5863
03:29:09,000 --> 03:29:10,000
AND AFFECTION AND LOVE FOR THE

5864
03:29:10,000 --> 03:29:12,000
CHILDREN AND EACH OTHER AND

5865
03:29:12,000 --> 03:29:13,000
YOU DRAW A LOT OF STRENGTH

5866
03:29:13,000 --> 03:29:14,000
FROM THAT, EVEN IN THEIR LIVES

5867
03:29:14,000 --> 03:29:16,000
OF GREATEST WEAKNESS AND WHAT

5868
03:29:16,000 --> 03:29:18,000
ST. PAUL TELLS US, THE

5869
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:19,000

5871
03:29:20,000 --> 03:29:21,000
MY FAITH WAS NOT SHAKEN BY

5872
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:22,000
THIS.

5873
03:29:22,000 --> 03:29:24,000
MY FAITH IN HUMANITY IS ALWAYS

5874
03:29:24,000 --> 03:29:26,000
SHAKEN WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS

5875
03:29:26,000 --> 03:29:30,000
HAPPEN AND THE CHILDREN CAN'T

5876
03:29:30,000 --> 03:29:31,000
TRUST BEING IN A PLACE SAFE

5877
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:33,000

COME IN AND TAKE THAT AWAY

5880
03:29:37,000 --> 03:29:39,000
FROM THEM.

5881
03:29:39,000 --> 03:29:41,000
WE'RE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE

5882
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:43,000
CHILDREN'S FEARS AND ANXIETIES

5883
03:29:43,000 --> 03:29:44,000

5969
03:35:59,000 --> 03:36:00,000
THREE THAT WE KNEW ABOUT

5970
03:36:00,000 --> 03:36:02,000
YESTERDAY.
SO, WE KNEW THAT HE HAD TWO

5971
03:36:02,000 --> 03:36:05,000
PISTOLS AND A RIFLE THAT THEY

5972
03:36:05,000 --> 03:36:06,000

FIREARMS FOUND ON SCHOOL

5975
03:36:12,000 --> 03:36:13,000
GROUNDS AND WE DON'T KNOW WHEN

5976
03:36:13,000 --> 03:36:15,000
AND AS FOR THE EVIDENCE

5977
03:36:15,000 --> 03:36:16,000
OUTSIDE, WE'RE TOLD THE

5978
03:36:16,000 --> 03:36:17,000

INCLUDE THE SUSPECT'S

5980
03:36:18,000 --> 03:36:20,000

5981
03:36:20,000 --> 03:36:21,000
SUSPECT VEHICLES AND MAYBE

5982
03:36:21,000 --> 03:36:22,000
SOME OF THE VICTIMS VEHICLES,

5983
03:36:22,000 --> 03:36:26,000
BUT WE'VE ALSO BEEN TOLD BY

5984
03:36:26,000 --> 03:36:27,000
SOME NEIGHBORS WHO HEARD THE

5985
03:36:27,000 --> 03:36:28,000
GUNSHOTS AND HEADED OVER

5986
03:36:28,000 --> 03:36:29,000
THERE, THEIR CARS ARE STUCK IN

5987
03:36:29,000 --> 03:36:32,000
THE AREA THAT'S LOCKED DOWN

5988
03:36:32,000 --> 03:36:33,000
AND JUST TRYING TO SORT OUT

5989
03:36:33,000 --> 03:36:35,000
WHOSE CAR GOES WHERE AND IF

5990
03:36:35,000 --> 03:36:38,000
THE PEOPLE WHO THE CAR OWNERS

5991
03:36:38,000 --> 03:36:40,000
SURVIVED YESTERDAY'S ATTACK.

5992
03:36:40,000 --> 03:36:42,000
AUTHORITIES ALSO ARE NOW

5993
03:36:42,000 --> 03:36:45,000
SAYING NA IT APPEARS THAT ADAM

5994
03:36:45,000 --> 03:36:47,000
LANZA SHOT OUT THE GLASS NEXT

5995
03:36:47,000 --> 03:36:49,000
TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE

5996
03:36:49,000 --> 03:36:51,000
SCHOOL, TO GAIN ENTRY.

5997
03:36:51,000 --> 03:36:52,000
NG A LOT ABOUT

5998
03:36:52,000 --> 03:36:54,000
HOW SECURE THE SCHOOL WAS.

5999
03:36:54,000 --> 03:36:56,000
I TALKED TO ANOTHER TEACHER

6000
03:36:56,000 --> 03:36:58,000
FROM THE DISTRICT, NOT FROM

6001
03:36:58,000 --> 03:36:59,000
THIS SPECIFIC SCHOOL, BUT

6002
03:36:59,000 --> 03:37:02,000
SOMEBODY WHO IS VERY, VERY

6003
03:37:02,000 --> 03:37:03,000
FAMILIAR WITH THE SECURITY

6004
03:37:03,000 --> 03:37:04,000
PROTOCOL AND SHE SAID AS SOON

6005
03:37:04,000 --> 03:37:05,000
AS SCHOOL STARTS IF ANYBODY

6006
03:37:05,000 --> 03:37:06,000
WANTS TO GET IN, INCLUDING

6007
03:37:06,000 --> 03:37:08,000
PARENTS OR SIBLINGS, THEY,

6008
03:37:08,000 --> 03:37:09,000
SINCE ALL THE DOORS ARE

6009
03:37:09,000 --> 03:37:11,000
LOCKED, THEY NEED TO BASICALLY

6010
03:37:11,000 --> 03:37:13,000
WAVE TO A CAMERA THAT BEAMS A

6011
03:37:13,000 --> 03:37:15,000
PICTURE INTO THE FRONT OFFICE

6012
03:37:15,000 --> 03:37:17,000
AND THEN SOMEONE IN THE FRONT

6013
03:37:17,000 --> 03:37:18,000
OFFICE NEEDS TO BUZZ THAT

6014
03:37:18,000 --> 03:37:20,000
PERSON IN AND THEN THAT PERSON

6015
03:37:20,000 --> 03:37:21,000
NEEDS TO GO RIGHT TO THE FRONT

6016
03:37:21,000 --> 03:37:22,000
OFFICE.

6017
03:37:22,000 --> 03:37:23,000
WE'RE HEARING NOW THAT

6018
03:37:23,000 --> 03:37:25,000
AUTHORITIES SAY IT APPEARS

6019
03:37:25,000 --> 03:37:27,000
THIS GUNMAN SHOT OUT THAT

6020
03:37:27,000 --> 03:37:28,000
GLASS.

6021
03:37:28,000 --> 03:37:29,000
WE ALSO TALKED TO A LIBRARY

6022
03:37:29,000 --> 03:37:31,000
CLERK.

6023
03:37:31,000 --> 03:37:32,000
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME NEW

6024
03:37:32,000 --> 03:37:33,000
SOUND AT THE TOP OF THE TEN

6025
03:37:33,000 --> 03:37:35,000
O'CLOCK HOUR, SHE SAID, SHE

6026
03:37:35,000 --> 03:37:37,000
WAS WITH SOME FOURTH GRADERS

6027
03:37:37,000 --> 03:37:40,000
IN THE BACK OF THE SCHOOL, BUT

6028
03:37:40,000 --> 03:37:42,000
SHE SAID HER UNDERSTANDING IS

6029
03:37:42,000 --> 03:37:43,000
THAT THE GUNMAN ENTERED THE

6030
03:37:43,000 --> 03:37:45,000
SCHOOL AND THEN SKIPPED THE

6031
03:37:45,000 --> 03:37:46,000
FIRST CLASSROOM AND THEN DID

6032
03:37:46,000 --> 03:37:48,000
MOST OF HIS SHOOTING IN THE

6033
03:37:48,000 --> 03:37:50,000
TWO CLASSROOMS NEXT TO THE

6034
03:37:50,000 --> 03:37:52,000
FIRST ONE.
SO WENT RIGHT PAST THE FIRST

6035
03:37:52,000 --> 03:37:53,000
ONE FOR SOME REASON ACCORDING

6036
03:37:53,000 --> 03:37:56,000
TO THIS LIBRARY CLERK, HER

6037
03:37:56,000 --> 03:37:58,000
NAME IS MARY ANNE JACOB AND

6038
03:37:58,000 --> 03:38:00,000
JUST DID THE SHOOTING IN THE

6039
03:38:00,000 --> 03:38:02,000
SECOND TWO CLASSROOMS, WE ALSO

6040
03:38:02,000 --> 03:38:04,000
ARE HEARING FROM HER THAT WHEN

6041
03:38:04,000 --> 03:38:07,000
THEY EVACUATED THE STUDENTS TO

6042
03:38:07,000 --> 03:38:10,000
THE FIREHOUSE, THEY ALL LINED

6043
03:38:10,000 --> 03:38:14,000
UP AND THEY ALL LINED UP BY

6044
03:38:14,000 --> 03:38:15,000
GRADE AND BEHIND THEIR

6045
03:38:15,000 --> 03:38:16,000
TEACHERS SO THEY COULD DO A

6046
03:38:16,000 --> 03:38:18,000
HEAD COUNT AND IT WAS THEN

6047
03:38:18,000 --> 03:38:19,000
THAT THE TEACHERS REALIZED

6048
03:38:19,000 --> 03:38:21,000
THAT ABOUT 10:30, ELEVEN

6049
03:38:21,000 --> 03:38:23,000
O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THAT

6050
03:38:23,000 --> 03:38:25,000
TWO ENTIRE FIRST GRADE CLASSES

6051
03:38:25,000 --> 03:38:27,000
WERE MISSING.

6052
03:38:27,000 --> 03:38:28,000
AND THIS LIBRARY CLERK, MARY

6053
03:38:28,000 --> 03:38:29,000
ANNE SAYS THAT THEY WERE AT

6054
03:38:29,000 --> 03:38:32,000
THE FIREHOUSE, WHICH IS WHERE

6055
03:38:32,000 --> 03:38:34,000
THE FAMILIES CAME TO CLAIM

6056
03:38:34,000 --> 03:38:35,000
THEIR CHILDREN AND REALIZED

6057
03:38:35,000 --> 03:38:37,000
WHEN THEY WERE LINING UP BY

6058
03:38:37,000 --> 03:38:38,000
GRADE BEHIND THEIR TEACHERS

6059
03:38:38,000 --> 03:38:40,000
THAT TWO ENTIRE FIRST GRADE

6060
03:38:40,000 --> 03:38:42,000
CLASSES WERE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR

6061
03:38:42,000 --> 03:38:44,000
EXCEPT FOR A FEW KIDS, AGAIN,

6062
03:38:44,000 --> 03:38:46,000
WE'RE EXPECTING TO HEAR MORE

6063
03:38:46,000 --> 03:38:47,000
INFORMATION WHENEVER THIS

6064
03:38:47,000 --> 03:38:49,000
PRESS CONFERENCE STARTS

6065
03:38:49,000 --> 03:38:50,000
HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT FEW

6066
03:38:50,000 --> 03:38:51,000
MINUTES, BACK TO YOU.

6067
03:38:51,000 --> 03:38:52,000
>> Brian: THANKS A LOT, PETER.

6068
03:38:52,000 --> 03:38:54,000
YOU WONDER THE ROLE, DID HE IN

6069
03:38:54,000 --> 03:38:57,000
FACT ATTEND THIS SCHOOL A

6070
03:38:57,000 --> 03:38:58,000
GRUDGE THAT THIS GUY IN HIS

6071
03:38:58,000 --> 03:39:00,000
TWISTED MIND WAS TRYING TO

6072
03:39:00,000 --> 03:39:02,000
AVENGE BY DOING THIS OR

6073
03:39:02,000 --> 03:39:03,000
PSYCHOTIC DRUGS PLAYING A ROLE

6074
03:39:03,000 --> 03:39:04,000
IN THIS.

6075
03:39:04,000 --> 03:39:05,000
CERTAINLY, WE STILL DON'T KNOW

6076
03:39:05,000 --> 03:39:06,000
A LOT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT

6077
03:39:06,000 --> 03:39:07,000
THE TIME OF THE SHOOTING, BUT

6078
03:39:07,000 --> 03:39:08,000
WE'RE FINDING OUT MORE.

6079
03:39:08,000 --> 03:39:10,000
>> Alisyn: MEANWHILE, ONE OF

6080
03:39:10,000 --> 03:39:15,000
THE SOURCES IS THE LIBRARY

6081
03:39:15,000 --> 03:39:17,000
CLERK THAT PETER JUST

6082
03:39:17,000 --> 03:39:20,000
MENTIONED, MARY ANNE JACOB AND

6083
03:39:20,000 --> 03:39:22,000
HE SHE WAS INSIDE THE SCHOOL

6084
03:39:22,000 --> 03:39:27,000
THE INTERCOM BUTTON, PA SYSTEM

6085
03:39:27,000 --> 03:39:29,000
WAS PRESSED AND ALERTED

6086
03:39:29,000 --> 03:39:30,000
TEACHERS SOMETHING WAS

6087
03:39:30,000 --> 03:39:32,000
TERRIBLY WRONG IN THE FRONT

6088
03:39:32,000 --> 03:39:34,000
OFFICE, LET'S LISTEN TO HER.

6089
03:39:34,000 --> 03:39:35,000
>> THE INTERCOM WENT OFF AS IF

6090
03:39:35,000 --> 03:39:37,000
THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE AN

6091
03:39:37,000 --> 03:39:38,000
ANNOUNCEMENT AND WE HEARD SOME

6092
03:39:38,000 --> 03:39:40,000
NOISES AND STUFF AND I THOUGHT

6093
03:39:40,000 --> 03:39:42,000
SOMEBODY HAD HIT THE BUTTON BY

6094
03:39:42,000 --> 03:39:44,000
MISTAKE AND THEY WERE IN THE

6095
03:39:44,000 --> 03:39:45,000
OFFICE AND I CALLED DOWN

6096
03:39:45,000 --> 03:39:46,000
THERE, AND ONE OF THE

6097
03:39:46,000 --> 03:39:47,000
SECRETARIES ANSWERED THE PHONE

6098
03:39:47,000 --> 03:39:48,000
AND SAID THERE WAS A SHOOTING

6099
03:39:48,000 --> 03:39:51,000
AND THEN YOU BECOME AWARE WE

6100
03:39:51,000 --> 03:39:53,000
STARTED HEARING THE GUNSHOTS,

6101
03:39:53,000 --> 03:39:55,000
SO I YELLED LOCKDOWN TO THE

6102
03:39:55,000 --> 03:39:58,000
GROUP IN OUR ROOM AND RAN

6103
03:39:58,000 --> 03:39:59,000
ACROSS THE HALL.

6104
03:39:59,000 --> 03:40:01,000
>> SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT

6105
03:40:01,000 --> 03:40:03,000
INTERCOM DID SAVE SOME LIVES

6106
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:05,000
BECAUSE PEOPLE STARTED TO LOCK

6107
03:40:05,000 --> 03:40:06,000
THEIR DOORS.

6108
03:40:06,000 --> 03:40:08,000
AND WITH PETER'S INFORMATION,

6109
03:40:08,000 --> 03:40:09,000
EARLIER THIS MORNING WE LOOKED

6110
03:40:09,000 --> 03:40:11,000
IN THE NEW YORK TIMES, IT SAYS

6111
03:40:11,000 --> 03:40:13,000
THAT THE PRINCIPAL BUZZED ADAM

6112
03:40:13,000 --> 03:40:15,000
LANZA IN, NOT THE CASE, HE

6113
03:40:15,000 --> 03:40:17,000
SHOT HIS WAY IN BY BREAKING

6114
03:40:17,000 --> 03:40:19,000
THE WINDOW AND MORE THAN THREE

6115
03:40:19,000 --> 03:40:20,000
GUNS WE KNEW OF.

6116
03:40:20,000 --> 03:40:22,000
IT'S INTERESTING WE KNOW THE

6117
03:40:22,000 --> 03:40:24,000
GUNS BELONGED TO HIS MOTHER

6118
03:40:24,000 --> 03:40:26,000
AND WE DON'T KNOW HIS

6119
03:40:26,000 --> 03:40:27,000
EXPERIENCE WITH A GUN.

6120
03:40:27,000 --> 03:40:28,000
AND IF HE WENT TO A PISTOL

6121
03:40:28,000 --> 03:40:31,000
RANGE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

6122
03:40:31,000 --> 03:40:34,000
AND A BIG GAMER AND APPARENTLY

6123
03:40:34,000 --> 03:40:36,000
VERY ACCURATE.

6124
03:40:36,000 --> 03:40:37,000
IS THERE A CONNECTION?

6125
03:40:37,000 --> 03:40:38,000
NO DOUBT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

6126
03:40:38,000 --> 03:40:40,000
BE CALLING FOR A REVIEW OF

6127
03:40:40,000 --> 03:40:41,000
VIDEO GAME RATINGS, NOW.

6128
03:40:41,000 --> 03:40:45,000
>> BUT HE'S 20 YEARS OLD.

6129
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:46,000
>> EXACTLY.

6130
03:40:46,000 --> 03:40:47,000
>> Brian: WE'RE GETTING NEW

6131
03:40:47,000 --> 03:40:51,000

6146
03:41:17,000 --> 03:41:19,000

03:41:19,000 --> 03:41:22,000
THEIR PARENTS' MARRIAGE WAS IN

6148
03:41:22,000 --> 03:41:23,000
SHAMBLES, ENDED IN 2008.

6149
03:41:23,000 --> 03:41:24,000
ALTHOUGH RYAN IS NOT A

6150
03:41:24,000 --> 03:41:25,000
SUSPECT.

6151
03:41:25,000 --> 03:41:26,000
HIS HOME WAS SEARCHED

6152
03:41:26,000 --> 03:41:27,000
YESTERDAY, ALONG WITH COMPUTER

6153
03:41:27,000 --> 03:41:28,000
AND PHONE RECORDS.

6154
03:41:28,000 --> 03:41:30,000
THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION AS TO

6155
03:41:30,000 --> 03:41:33,000
HIS IDENTITY, OR AS TO THE

6156
03:41:33,000 --> 03:41:34,000
IDENTITY OF THE SHOOTER,

6157
03:41:34,000 --> 03:41:37,000
THAT'S BECAUSE ADAM LANZA WAS

6158
03:41:37,000 --> 03:41:40,000
CARRYING THE I.D. OF RYAN

6159
03:41:40,000 --> 03:41:41,000
LANZA.

6160
03:41:41,000 --> 03:41:43,000
WE CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT THE

6161
03:41:43,000 --> 03:41:45,000
FBI SAYS THEY QUESTIONED THE

6162
03:41:45,000 --> 03:41:46,000
FATHER, THEY QUESTIONED RYAN

6163
03:41:46,000 --> 03:41:47,000
AND THEY'RE SAID TO BE IN

6164
03:41:47,000 --> 03:41:50,000
CONNECTICUT NOW, THEY WERE

6165
03:41:50,000 --> 03:41:52,000
VERY COOPERATIVE AND THAT'S

6166
03:41:52,000 --> 03:41:54,000
PRETTY MUCH THE LATEST HERE,

6167
03:41:54,000 --> 03:41:56,000
AS FAR AS WHAT THEY MENTIONED

6168
03:41:56,000 --> 03:41:57,000
TO THE AUTHORITIES ABOUT HIS

6169
03:41:57,000 --> 03:41:59,000
DEMEANOR, THEY SAID THAT HE

6170
03:41:59,000 --> 03:42:01,000
HAD A PERSONALITY DISORDER OF

6171
03:42:01,000 --> 03:42:04,000
SOME SORT, WAS AUTISTIC, AND

6172
03:42:04,000 --> 03:42:06,000
RYAN ALSO TOLD US HE HAD NOT

6173
03:42:06,000 --> 03:42:10,000
SPOKEN WITH ADAM SINCE 2010.

6174
03:42:10,000 --> 03:42:11,000
ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE WERE YOU

6175
03:42:11,000 --> 03:42:12,000
TALKING ABOUT THAT, BRIAN.

6176
03:42:12,000 --> 03:42:14,000
HE SAID I WAS AT WORK, IT

6177
03:42:14,000 --> 03:42:16,000
WASN'T ME.
YOU CAN JUST REALLY IMAGINE

6178
03:42:16,000 --> 03:42:17,000
WHAT HE WAS GOING THROUGH,

6179
03:42:17,000 --> 03:42:18,000
WHEN PEOPLE WERE THINKING HE

6180
03:42:18,000 --> 03:42:22,000
WAS A MASS MURDERER.

6181
03:42:22,000 --> 03:42:24,000
BACK TO YOU.

SPOKEN IN TWO YEARS.

WITH ADAM.

6190
03:42:39,000 --> 03:42:40,000
AND TALKING ABOUT HOW TO

6191
03:42:40,000 --> 03:42:42,000
EXPLAIN THIS TO YOUR CHILDREN,

6192
03:42:42,000 --> 03:42:44,000
IF THEY HAPPENED TO HEAR ABOUT

6193
03:42:44,000 --> 03:42:46,000
IT OR SEEN IT IN A NEWSPAPER

6194
03:42:46,000 --> 03:42:51,000
OR TELEVISION, AND HOW DO YOU

6195
03:42:51,000 --> 03:42:54,000
TELL THEM THAT THINGS LIKE

6196
03:42:54,000 --> 03:42:57,000
THIS EXIST.

03:42:57,000 --> 03:42:59,000
AND SURVIVAL SKILLS, WHAT AGE

03:42:59,000 --> 03:43:04,000
IS APPROPRIATE NEXT.

6199
03:43:08,000 --> 03:43:12,000
>>  TWO PAST THE BUILDING,

6200
03:43:12,000 --> 03:43:17,000
PAST THE GYM.

6201
03:46:22,000 --> 03:46:23,000
>>  ALL RIGHT.

6202
03:46:23,000 --> 03:46:24,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

6203
03:46:24,000 --> 03:46:26,000
THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING

6204
03:46:26,000 --> 03:46:27,000
EVERYTHING RIGHT AND A NEW

6205
03:46:27,000 --> 03:46:28,000
SECURITY SYSTEM AND THEY

6206
03:46:28,000 --> 03:46:30,000
LOCKED THE FRONT DOORS

6207
03:46:30,000 --> 03:46:32,000
REQUIRING VISITORS TO GET

6208
03:46:32,000 --> 03:46:34,000
INSIDE AFTER SCHOOL STARTS AND

6209
03:46:34,000 --> 03:46:35,000
TRAGICALLY NOT ENOUGH FOR THE

6210
03:46:35,000 --> 03:46:36,000
26 PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR

6211
03:46:36,000 --> 03:46:37,000
LIVES.

6212
03:46:37,000 --> 03:46:38,000
SO, WHAT ELSE CAN SCHOOLS DO

6213
03:46:38,000 --> 03:46:40,000
TO PREPARE AND PROTECT

6214
03:46:40,000 --> 03:46:42,000
THEMSELVES FOR A MASS SHOOTING

6215
03:46:42,000 --> 03:46:43,000
SCENARIO LIKE THIS.

>> Alisyn: A FORMER N.Y.P.D.

DETECTIVE AND A SECURITY

6218
03:46:48,000 --> 03:46:49,000
EXPERT.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR STICKING

6219
03:46:49,000 --> 03:46:50,000
AROUND WITH US.

6220
03:46:50,000 --> 03:46:52,000
OF COURSE, YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON

6221
03:46:52,000 --> 03:46:54,000
THIS IS AS A SECURITY EXPERT.

6222
03:46:54,000 --> 03:46:56,000
WE'VE HEARD OTHERS COME ON AND

6223
03:46:56,000 --> 03:46:57,000
SAY, THIS IS VERY RARE, YOU

6224
03:46:57,000 --> 03:46:58,000
SHOULDN'T HAVE YOUR KIDS

6225
03:46:58,000 --> 03:47:00,000
OBSESS ABOUT THIS.

6226
03:47:00,000 --> 03:47:01,000
THIS WILL ONLY MAKE YOUR KIDS

6227
03:47:01,000 --> 03:47:02,000
NERVOUS.

6228
03:47:02,000 --> 03:47:04,000
YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT TAKE ON
THAT AND YOU THINK YOU SHOULD

6229
03:47:04,000 --> 03:47:06,000
PREPARE YOUR KIDS FOR AN

6230
03:47:06,000 --> 03:47:07,000
EMERGENCY DRILL.

6231
03:47:07,000 --> 03:47:08,000
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

6232
03:47:08,000 --> 03:47:09,000
>> EXACTLY.

6233
03:47:09,000 --> 03:47:12,000
AND YOU KNOW, AND WHEN I GREW

6234
03:47:12,000 --> 03:47:14,000
UP AS A LITTLE KID, I WAS

6235
03:47:14,000 --> 03:47:16,000
PLAYING SHOOT-EM-UP BANG-BANG

6236
03:47:16,000 --> 03:47:18,000
COWBOYS IN THE PARK EVERY

6237
03:47:18,000 --> 03:47:19,000
NIGHT.
THE KIDS AREN'T DOING THAT.

6238
03:47:19,000 --> 03:47:21,000
THEY'RE OUT THERE PLAYING THE

6239
03:47:21,000 --> 03:47:24,000
VIDEO GAMES AND THINGS LIKE

6240
03:47:24,000 --> 03:47:26,000
THAT.
IF I WAS FIVE, SIX YEARS OLD,

6241
03:47:26,000 --> 03:47:28,000
I WOULD HAVE KNOWN A LITTLE

6242
03:47:28,000 --> 03:47:29,000
HOW TO REACT HOW THIS

6243
03:47:29,000 --> 03:47:30,000
HAPPENED.

6244
03:47:30,000 --> 03:47:31,000
I WOULD HIT THE DECK BECAUSE I

6245
03:47:31,000 --> 03:47:32,000
WATCHED ON THE TV SHOWS I

6246
03:47:32,000 --> 03:47:34,000
WATCHED AS A KID.

6247
03:47:34,000 --> 03:47:38,000
BUT YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM HERE

6248
03:47:38,000 --> 03:47:40,000
IS THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS

6249
03:47:40,000 --> 03:47:41,000
SCHOOL WAS VERY PREPARED.

6250
03:47:41,000 --> 03:47:42,000
ALL RIGHT.

6251
03:47:42,000 --> 03:47:44,000
IT LOOKS LIKE--
>> DO YOU LIKE THE SYSTEM, DO

6252
03:47:44,000 --> 03:47:46,000
YOU LIKE THE SYSTEM?
>> I LIKE THE SYSTEM.

6253
03:47:46,000 --> 03:47:47,000
COULD IT BE IMPROVED ON?

6254
03:47:47,000 --> 03:47:49,000
ANYTHING COULD BE IMPROVED ON.

6255
03:47:49,000 --> 03:47:51,000
WHEN IT COMES TO ME I'M

6256
03:47:51,000 --> 03:47:53,000
LOOKING AT THE BEST CASE

6257
03:47:53,000 --> 03:47:54,000
SCENARIO FOR YOU, THESE ARE

6258
03:47:54,000 --> 03:47:55,000
THE BEST THINGS THAT WE CAN

6259
03:47:55,000 --> 03:47:56,000
DO.

6260
03:47:56,000 --> 03:47:58,000
THIS IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO

6261
03:47:58,000 --> 03:47:59,000
COST YOU AND THEN LOOK AT

6262
03:47:59,000 --> 03:48:01,000
WHAT'S COST EFFECTIVE FOR YOU.

6263
03:48:01,000 --> 03:48:03,000
>> Steve: THE NEW NEWS THIS

6264
03:48:03,000 --> 03:48:05,000
MORNING IN THE LAST HOUR OR SO

6265
03:48:05,000 --> 03:48:06,000
IS THE FACT THAT THIS GUY, YOU

6266
03:48:06,000 --> 03:48:10,000
KNOW, HE SHOT HIS WAY IN.

6267
03:48:10,000 --> 03:48:11,000
>> RIGHT.

6268
03:48:11,000 --> 03:48:12,000
>> Steve: HE WASN'T BUZZED IN.

6269
03:48:12,000 --> 03:48:13,000
HE SHOT THROUGH THE GLASS AND

6270
03:48:13,000 --> 03:48:16,000
SOMEHOW OPENED THE DOOR.

6271
03:48:16,000 --> 03:48:21,000
IT'S HARD TO HARDEN THE ENTIRE

6272
03:48:22,000 --> 03:48:24,000
SCHOOL.
>> THEY CAN'T PROTECT THE

PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

6274
03:48:27,000 --> 03:48:29,000
100%, AND SO WE CAN'T PROTECT

6275
03:48:29,000 --> 03:48:32,000
THE SCHOOL 100%, THERE'S WAYS

6276
03:48:32,000 --> 03:48:34,000
TO SLOW THE SHOOTER DOWN FOR

6277
03:48:34,000 --> 03:48:35,000
THE POLICE RESPONSE.

6278
03:48:35,000 --> 03:48:37,000

6279
03:48:37,000 --> 03:48:39,000
YOUNG FOR KIDS IN YOUR MIND?

CAN YOU TEACH A FIVE,

6281
03:48:41,000 --> 03:48:43,000
SIX-YEAR-OLD WHAT TO DO IN AN

6282
03:48:43,000 --> 03:48:44,000
ACTIVE SHOOTER.

6283
03:48:44,000 --> 03:48:47,000
>> SURE, MAKE IT A GAME.

6284
03:48:47,000 --> 03:48:51,000
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP,

6285
03:48:51,000 --> 03:48:52,000
KINDERGARTENER, THERE WAS A

6286
03:48:52,000 --> 03:48:54,000
SOVIET THREAT.

6287
03:48:54,000 --> 03:48:56,000
>> DUCK AND COVER.

6288
03:48:56,000 --> 03:48:57,000
>> UNDER A DESK OR HIDE LIKE

6289
03:48:57,000 --> 03:48:59,000
THIS UP AGAINST THE WALL.

6290
03:48:59,000 --> 03:49:01,000
YOU CAN MAKE IT A GAME FOR THE

6291
03:49:01,000 --> 03:49:03,000
KIDS AND THEY LOVE TO PLAY

6292
03:49:03,000 --> 03:49:04,000
GAMES AND RELATE TO SOMETHING

6293
03:49:04,000 --> 03:49:05,000
LIKE THIS IF IT HAPPENS.

6294
03:49:05,000 --> 03:49:07,000
>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

6295
03:49:07,000 --> 03:49:08,000
SECURING THE DOOR AND MAYBE

6296
03:49:08,000 --> 03:49:10,000
HAVING A DEAD BOLT SO PEEFR

6297
03:49:10,000 --> 03:49:11,000
SCHOOL HAS AN ABILITY WHEN THE

6298
03:49:11,000 --> 03:49:12,000
ALARM GOES OFF.

6299
03:49:12,000 --> 03:49:13,000
>> RIGHT.

6300
03:49:13,000 --> 03:49:14,000
>> THEY CAN QUICKLY DEAD BOLT

6301
03:49:14,000 --> 03:49:16,000
THE DOOR AND SLOW DOWN THE

6302
03:49:16,000 --> 03:49:17,000
GUY.

6303
03:49:17,000 --> 03:49:18,000
THE BIG QUESTION PEOPLE HAVE

6304
03:49:18,000 --> 03:49:19,000
NOW, WRITING AND TWEETING US,

6305
03:49:19,000 --> 03:49:22,000
WOULD IT BE BET ARE TO HAVE

6306
03:49:22,000 --> 03:49:24,000
SOMEBODY AT THAT DOOR ARMED IN

6307
03:49:24,000 --> 03:49:26,000
A SMALL COMMUNITY LIKE

6308
03:49:26,000 --> 03:49:28,000
NEWTOWN?
>> AGAIN, BEST CASE SCENARIO,

6309
03:49:28,000 --> 03:49:29,000
I SAY YES, NOW WHY?

6310
03:49:29,000 --> 03:49:30,000
BECAUSE IT'S OUR CHILDREN AND

6311
03:49:30,000 --> 03:49:31,000
NOT GOING TO--

6312
03:49:31,000 --> 03:49:33,000
LISTEN, WE'VE GOT POLICE

6313
03:49:33,000 --> 03:49:34,000
OFFICERS, SECURITY PEOPLE OUT

6314
03:49:34,000 --> 03:49:35,000
ON THE STREET EVERY DAY, ALL

6315
03:49:35,000 --> 03:49:36,000
OVER THIS COUNTRY, THAT ARE

6316
03:49:36,000 --> 03:49:37,000
ARMED.

6317
03:49:37,000 --> 03:49:38,000
AND SOME PEOPLE ARE AFRAID

6318
03:49:38,000 --> 03:49:40,000
THAT EVEN THEY'RE ARMED.

6319
03:49:40,000 --> 03:49:41,000
ALL RIGHT?

6320
03:49:41,000 --> 03:49:42,000
AND NOTHING BAD HAPPENS.

6321
03:49:42,000 --> 03:49:43,000
ALL RIGHT?

6322
03:49:43,000 --> 03:49:44,000
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE WE HAVE

6323
03:49:44,000 --> 03:49:45,000
SOME KIND AFTER PROBLEM, ALL

6324
03:49:45,000 --> 03:49:47,000
RIGHT?
BUT I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK

6325
03:49:47,000 --> 03:49:48,000
THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH

6326
03:49:48,000 --> 03:49:51,000
HAVING AN ARMED GUARD AND--

6327
03:49:51,000 --> 03:49:52,000
>> AND PERHAPS THE LOCAL

6328
03:49:52,000 --> 03:49:54,000
POLICE FORCE.
>> RIGHT, OR A LOCAL POLICE

6329
03:49:54,000 --> 03:49:55,000
FORCE OR SOMEBODY WHO IS

6330
03:49:55,000 --> 03:49:56,000
