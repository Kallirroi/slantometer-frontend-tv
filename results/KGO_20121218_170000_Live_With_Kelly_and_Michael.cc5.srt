FIVE INTERCEPTIONS, POUR OR FIVE

64
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
INTERCEPTIONS WHICH MEANS THAT

65
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
THE JETS ARE OFFICIALLY OUT OF

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000

WELL, YOU KNOW, THE GIANTS WENT

84
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
THAT WAS FUNNY.

85
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
AND I GIVE IT TO THE FALCONS.

86
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
THE FALCONS BEAT THEM LIKE THEY

87
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
STOLE SOMETHING.

88
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I MEAN, IT WAS BAD.

89
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
34-0.
KELLY: WOW.

MICHAEL: ATLANTA LOOKED GREAT.

91
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
BUT THE GIANTS LOOKED BAD.

92
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
BUT NOW THEY HAVE TO WIN THE

93
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
NEXT TWO GAMES TO MAKE THE

94
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
PLAYOFFS.

95
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
KELLY: THEY HAVE TO.
MICHAEL: THEY HAVE TO.

96
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
THEY HAVE NO CHOICE.

97
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
THEY HAVE TO PLAY THE RAVENS AND

98
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES.

99
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
KELLY: OH.

103
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
THEY'RE OUT OF THE PLAYOFFS, BUT

104
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
WHAT BETTER PRESENT TO GIVE YOUR

105
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
RIFLES A PRESENT BY SENDING THEM

106
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
HOME?
THE GIANTS HAVE TWO HARD GAMES

107
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
TO GET IN.

108
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
AND THE KNICKS HAVE BEEN REALLY

109
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
HARD.
ONE OF THE BEST TEAMS IN THE NBA

110
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
BUT LAST NIGHT, THEIR OLD

111
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000

TOWN AND THE ROCKETS BEAT THE

113
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
KNICKS BY 13 POINTS.

114
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
NO, 12 POINTS.

115
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
KELLY: LIN OF THE LIN-SANITY.

116
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
HE WAS A KNICK, RIGHT?

117
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
MICHAEL: YES.
KELLY: WHEN DID HE NOT BECOME A

118
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
KNICK?

119
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
[LAUGHTER]
MICHAEL: ARE YOU SERIOUS?

120
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
KELLY: NO, I'M SERIOUS.

121
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000

I DON'T KEEP UP WITH JEREMY LIN.

123
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000

125
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
ATHLETE.
KELLY: I NEVER GOOGLE ATHLETES.

126
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I GOOGLE THINGS LIKE --

127
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000

AND IT WAS A BIG DEAL WHEN THEY

133
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
LET HIM GO OR WHEN HE SIGNED

134
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
WITH THE ROCKETS BECAUSE THE

135
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
KNICKS DID NOT MATCH THE DEAL

136
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
THAT THE ROCKETS GAVE HIM.

137
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
KNICKS CAN MATCH ANY DEAL EVER.

141
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
MICHAEL: THEY CAN BUT I GUESS

142
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
THEY FEEL IT COULDN'T MAKE IT

143
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
FINANCIALLY SO THE ROCKETS WOULD

144
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
HAVE TO PAY HIM LIKE $20

145
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
KNOW, KELLY, YOU'RE NOT PLAYING

188
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
LIKE YOU USED TO.

189
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
KELLY: RIGHT.

190
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
MICHAEL: GOOD LUCK.

191
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
KELLY: RIGHT.

192
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
HOLY COW!
MICHAEL: YEAH.

193
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

194
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
MICHAEL: YEP.

195
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
THAT'S WHY I WAS STRESSED FOR 15

196
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
YEARS.

197
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
[LAUGHTER]

198
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
KELLY: THAT'S A LOT OF STRESS.

199
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
MICHAEL: MOMMA NEEDS SOME SHOES!

200
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
KELLY: WOW.

201
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

202
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
MICHAEL: YEAH.

203
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
KELLY: DID YOU GUYS KNOW THAT?

204
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
HALF OF YOU KNEW AND HALF OF YOU

205
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
DID NOT KNOW.

206
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
KELLY: HOW MANY OF YOU ARE

207
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
GUARANTEED YOUR SALARY AT WORK?

208
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
GO AHEAD, GELMAN.

209
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
RAISE YOUR HAND OVER THERE.

210
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
GO AHEAD, GELMAN.

211
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
RAISE YOUR HAND.

212
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
KELLY: WITH WE GUARANTEED OUR

213
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
SALARY?

214
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
GELMAN: YES, YOU ARE.

215
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
MICHAEL: OH, REALLY?

216
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I DON'T HAVE TO FOOL NOW?

217
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I WON'T GET FIRED?

218
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
[LAUGHTER]

219
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
GELMAN: WE DO HAVE SOME OUTS

220
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
HID, IN THERE.

221
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
-- HIDDEN IN THERE.

222
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
MICHAEL: OH, I BETTER READ MY

223
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
CONTRACT.
KELLY: I'VE BEEN AGONIZING ABOUT

224
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
WHAT TO GET YOU FOR CHRISTMAS

225
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO KIND AND SO

226
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
LOVELY AND SO GENEROUS I HAVE TO

227
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
DO SOMETHING NICE FOR YOU.

228
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
AND I SAW THE NEWSPAPER

229
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
THAT I SORT OF WANT TO GET YOUR

230
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
OPINION THAT I GO OUT AND INVEST

231
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
IN THESE STATEMENT PIECES.

232
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
MICHAEL: STATEMENT PIECES.

233
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
OH, BOY.

234
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
KELLY: HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT

235
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
LEGGINGS?
MALE LEG

236
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THIS IS WHAT THEY KIND OF --

237
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
[LAUGHTER]

238
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
MICHAEL: WELL, BEFORE YOU WASTE

239
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
YOUR MONEY, I WILL TELL YOU

240
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THAT.

241
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
KELLY: OK.

242
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
MICHAEL: WEREN'T YOU SAY THAT

243
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
LEGGINGS ARE NOT PANTS?

244
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
KELLY: NO.

245
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
THEY'RE LEGGINGS.
I'M GOING TO GET YOU A BIG BAGGY

246
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
SWEATER TO WEAR OVER IT JUST

247
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
LIKE WE DID IN THE 1980'S.

248
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
MAYBE AN OFF-THE-SHOULDER

249
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
NUMBER.

250
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
MAYBE A BELT.
MICHAEL: I SAY NO TO THE

251
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
MEGGINS.

252
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
KELLY: ARE YOU SURE?

253
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I DON'T WANT TO INVEST $20

254
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
THAT'S GOING TO SET ME BACK.

255
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
MICHAEL: ARE THEY IN STYLE?

256
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
KELLY: YES.

257
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
MEN HAVE BEEN SEEN WEARING

258
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
LEGGINGS.

259
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
LEGGINGS.
MICHAEL: FIRST OF ALL, WHEN YOUR

260
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
LEGS LOOK LIKE A FLAGPOLE, YOU

261
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
MAY BE ABLE TO WEAR THOSE

262
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
THINGS.

263
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I ACTUALLY HAVE A MUSCLE ON MY

264
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
LEGS.

265
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
KELLY: YEAH, YOU DO.

266
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
MICHAEL: IMAGINE ME WALKING

267
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
ACROSS BROADWAY IN SOMING MINGS.

268
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
-- MEGGINGS.

269
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
KELLY: ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE THESE

270
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
ARE LEGGINGS.

271
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
BECAUSE THESE LOOK LIKE LADY

272
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
PANS IN THIS AREA.

273
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
MICHAEL: THE SKINNY JEANS TOOK A

274
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
WHILE FOR ME TO GET IN.

275
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
IF HE PULLED THEM ALL THE WAY

276
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
UP, I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD BE

277
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
LIKE THAT HIGH OVER THE ANKLE.

278
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
KELLY: NO, THEY USED TO WEAR

279
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
THEM DOWN.
MICHAEL: THEY'RE SO SKINNY.

280
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
KELLY: HOW OLD IS HE?

281
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
MICHAEL: 18.

282
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
KELLY: RIGHT.

283
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
MICHAEL: OH, NO, HE'S 20 NOW.

284
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
KELLY: YEAH.

285
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
SO THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT YOUNG

286
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
MEN LIKE -- YOUNG MEN COME IN

287
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
TWO SIZES, LIKE VERY SPINLY AND

288
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
ROBUST.

289
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
BECAUSE LIKE I FEEL LIKE YOUNG

290
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
BOYS HAVE LIKE THESE SPINLY

291
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
LITTLE LEGS.

292
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
ROBUST. I LOVE THE WORD

293
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
HEY, EURO BUST.

294
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
[LAUGHTER]
KELLY: BUT MICK JAGGER IS

295
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
SOMEBODY THAT CAN WEAR MEGGINGS

296
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
WITHOUT WEARING A BLUE SHIRT

297
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
OVER TOP.

298
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
MICHAEL: AND MILES IS MICK

299
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
JAGGER LIKE SPINLY BUT THERE'S

300
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
NO REASON FOR MEGGINGS.

301
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
SOMETIMES, FELLOWS, I DON'T CARE

302
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
WHAT YOU'RE BUILT LIKE, DO NOT

303
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
PUT ON SOME TIGHTS BECAUSE IF I

304
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
SEE YOU, I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT

305
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
YOU RIGHT THERE IN YOUR FACE.

306
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
YOU'RE WRONG FOR THIS.

307
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

308
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
KELLY: I HOPE I SAVED THAT GIFT

309
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
RECEIPT.

310
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
WELL, HERE'S ANOTHER TREND THAT

311
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I WAS GOING TO INVEST IN YOU.

312
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
AND I JUST FOUND OUT THAT GELMAN

313
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000

314
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000

[APPLAUSE]

320
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000

335
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
MICHAEL: ONE COOKIE A MONTH

336
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
WOULD JUST MAKE ME MAD.

337
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
IT'S SOMETHING, I GUESS.

338
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
KELLY: ARE THEY LUCKOUS SOCKS?

339
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000

340
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000

341
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000

KELLY: YOU WOULD?

346
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
SO THAT'S SOMETHING I WON'T HAVE

347
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
TO TAKE BACK.

348
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000

THAT OUR FRIEND, CHANNING TATUM

359
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
CAN'T BELIEVE HE FOUND SOMEBODY

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
THAT WOULD DO IT WITH HIM.

364
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
YEAH, NO.

365
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
SO APPARENTLY HIS WIFE AGREES HE

366
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
IS IN FACT THE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE

367
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
AND HE'S GOING TO BE THE SEXIEST

368
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
ANNIVERSARY.

745
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
>> EXACTLY.
I GOT MARRIED.

746
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
YES.

747
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
[APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.

748
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
IT'S TRUE.

749
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO, IT

750
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
FINALLY HAPPENED FOR ME.

751
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
IT WAS GOOD.

752
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
IT WAS SCARY.

753
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
NO.
[LAUGHTER]
YEAH, I GOT MARRIED OVER A YEAR

754
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
AGO AND WE'RE STILL MARRIED,

755
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD.

756
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
KELLY: I BELIEVE LIKE THE FIRST

757
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
EYE OF MARRIAGE, I MEAN, FROM MY

758
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
POINT OF VIEW, THE HARDEST.

759
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
DID YOU MIND IT -- FIND IT TO BE

760
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
THE HARD SHE'S

761
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
>> NO, I FOUND OUT SHE'S BEEN

762
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
FULL OF RAGE TO ME THAT I

763
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
HAVEN'T ASKED HER TO MARRY HER

764
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
EARLIER, THIS YEAR HAS BEEN THE

765
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
GREATEST YEAR OF MY LIFE.

766
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I DON'T GET THE SENSE THAT SHE'S

767
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
GOING TO STAB ME IN MY SLEEP.

768
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
MICHAEL: YOU'RE FUNNY, MAN.

769
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
YOUR PROPOSAL STORY THAT YOU

770
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
TOLD, YOU PROPOSED TO HER WHEN

771
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
YOU SAID SHE WAS TOPLESS, BUT --

772
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
>> SHE WAS --

773
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
MICHAEL: YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW

774
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
>> NO.

775
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I PROPOSED TO HER.
SHE WAS CHANGING.

776
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I GOT THE RING AND I FELT LIKE I

777
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
HAD A NUCLEAR BOMB LIKE I HAD TO

778
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
GET RID OF IT.

779
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
LIKE I'VE GOT UNLOAD THIS THING.

780
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
IED A ALL OF THESE ELABORATE

781
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
PLANS AND THE SEC I GOT HOME, I

782
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
THOUGHT I'M DOING IT AND SHE'S

783
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
CHANGING AND SHE'S TOPLESS.

784
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW.

785
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
[LAUGHTER]

786
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
AND I GUESS SHE DIDN'T TELL MANY

787
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
PEOPLE THAT STORY BECAUSE SHE

788
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
WASN'T AS PSYCHED ABOUT IT AS I

789
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
WAS.

790
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
AND THEN I STARTED TELLING IT ON

791
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
TALK SHOWS AND MAGAZINES AND

792
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
STUFF LIKE THAT AND HER

793
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
FATHER-IN-LAW, I GUESS DIDN'T

794
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
KNOW AND WASN'T, YOU KNOW,

795
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
TICKLED BY IT AS I WAS.

796
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
KELLY: YOU MEAN YOUR

797
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
FATHER-IN-LAW?
>> MY FATHER-IN-LAW.

798
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
BOTH FATHERS-IN-LAW.
I'M NOT GOOD AT THIS.

799
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
IS HE MY IN-LAW?

800
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
HE'S NOT MY STEP DAD?

801
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
KELLY: NO, HE'S YOUR

802
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
FATHER-IN-LAW, NOT YOUR STEPDAD.

803
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
IF HE WAS YOUR STEPDAD, THAT

804
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
WOULD BE REALLY CREEPY.

805
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
>> YOU NEVER KNOW.

806
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
KELLY: AND YOU'VE ALSO IN

807
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
ADDITION TO CELEBRATING YOUR

808
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY, YOU

809
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
DIRECTED YOUR OWN FILM?

810
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
>> I DID.

811
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
IT COMES OUT THIS SUMMER WITH ME

812
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000

815
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
PAUL RUDD IS A PART OF IT.

816
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
EVERY IDIOT I'M IN EVERY MOVIE

817
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
IS IN IT.

818
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
MICHAEL: SO WE HAVE TO TAKE A

819
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
QUICK BREAK.

820
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL FIND

821
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000

822
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
COUPLE, STREISAND AND ROGEN.

823
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
KELLY: OH, MY GOD.

824
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
ANNOUNCER: STILL AHEAD ON

825
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
BROADWAY MUSICAL "ANNIE."

827
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
MICHAEL: WE ARE BACK WITH SETH

828
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
ROGEN, STAR OF DEBATE DESK.

829
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
-- "THE GUILTY TRIP."

830
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
HOLIDAY IS HERE.

831
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
HOW IS ZELLEDA DOING?

832
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
>> SHE'S GOOD.

833
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
SHE'S JEWISH.

834
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
KELLY: WAS SHE BORN JEWISH?

835
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
>> WE CONVERTED HER TO JEWISH.

836
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
KELLY: GOOD FOR HER.

837
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
>> MY WIFE MAKES THESE CALENDARS

838
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
SHE TORTURES OUR DOG AND DRESS

839
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
HER UP.

840
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
THAT MIGHT BE ILLEGAL.

841
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
SHE DOES NOT LOOK HAPPY IN THAT

842
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
PICTURE.
IF SHE COULD TALK, SHE WOULD SAY

843
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
"WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME"

844
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
KELLY: SHE'S SO CUTE.

845
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
>> SHE'S A VERY CUTE DOG.

846
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
VERY CUTE DOG.

847
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
KELLY: LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR NEW

848
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
FILM, "THE GUILTY TRIP," WHERE

849
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
YOU GO ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH

850
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
BARBRA STREISAND.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GET TO SPEND

851
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
SO MUCH TIME WITH HER IN A CAR

852
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
GOING ACROSS COUNTRY.

853
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
>> YEP, WE DID NOT LEAVE MALIBU,

854
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
ACTUALLY, WHILE GOING ACROSS

855
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
COUNTRY.
KELLY: ARE YOU KIDDING?

856
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
>> NO.
BARBRA DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE

857
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
MALIBU.
SHE LOVES IT THERE.

858
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
WHEN YOU'RE BARBRA STREISAND,

859
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
YOU CAN SAY THINGS OVER THERE.

860
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
SHE COULD SAY I WANT TO DRIVE

861
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
CROSS-COUNTRY BUT I DON'T WANT

862
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
TO LEAVE MALIBU.

863
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
THERE'S A SCENE WHERE

864
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
DR WE'RE
DRIVING TO GRAND CANYON AND WE

865
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
BROUGHT THE GRAND CANYON TO HER.

866
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
KELLY: SO IT WAS A SCREEN?

867
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
>> YEAH.

868
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
AND SHE JUST LIKE THE WHOLE

869
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
TIME, WE'RE LIKE IN BARBRA'S

870
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
FRONT LAWN.

871
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
LITERALLY.

872
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
IT'S REMARKABLE.

873
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
MICHAEL: DID YOU HAVE ANY

874
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
HESITATIONS ABOUT DOING A MOVIE

875
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
WITH BARBRA STREISAND?

876
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I MEAN, SUCH A BIG STAR?

877
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
>> NO, NOT REALLY.

878
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I HONESTLY JUST -- I USUALLY

879
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
JUST MAKE REALLY FILTHY MOVIES.

880
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
SO I WASN'T -- I HAD HESITATIONS

881
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
ABOUT DOING A MOVIE THAT WASN'T

882
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
REALLY DIRTY.
I WASN'T SURE IF I COULD STILL

883
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
BE FUNNY.
THAT WAS MY MAJOR FEAR, BUT THE

884
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
SCRIPT IS REALLY GOOD AND IT'S A

885
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
REALLY SWEET MOVIE AND IT'S

886
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
PROBABLY, YEAH, ONE OF THE FIRST

887
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
MOVIES I'VE DONE THAT LIKE A LOT

888
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
OF PEOPLE WON'T REALLY HATE ME

889
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
FOR.
SO YEAH, IT WAS REFRESHING TO

890
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
DO, ACTUALLY.
KELLY: AND I KNOW THAT YOUR WIFE

891
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
IS A HUGE BARBRA STREISAND FAN.

892
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
SO WHEN SHE HEARD YOU WERE

893
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
OFFERED THIS FILM, DID YOU SHE

894
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
SAY YOU'RE DOING IT?

895
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
>> SHE WAS REALLY PSYCHED ABOUT

896
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
IT.
SHE'S A HUGE FAN.

897
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
SHE'S DRAGGED ME TO SEVERAL OF

898
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
BARBRA'S CONCERTS OVER THE

899
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
YEARS.
I LOVE IT.

900
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
[LAUGHTER]

901
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
IT'S NOT MY KIND OF MUSIC.

902
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

903
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I LISTEN TO RAP.

904
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
BUT YEAH, SHE'S -- NOW MY WIFE

905
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
AND BARBRA KNOW EACH OTHER.

906
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
SHE'S THRILLED.

907
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
MICHAEL: YOU'RE MOTHER AND SON

908
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
IN THE FIT.
BUT WERE THERE ANY SIMILARITY

909
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
BETWEEN YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR

910
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
REAL MOTHER?

911
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
>> YEAH, THEY'RE BOTH JEWISH

912
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
LADIES.
THAT'S LIKE 98% OF SOMEONE'S

913
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
PERSONALITY, I THINK, IN A LOT

914
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
OF WAYS.

915
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
[LAUGHTER]
SHE PUSHES ME TO EAT A BUNCH OF

916
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
STUFF I DON'T WANT AND WHEN I

917
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
EAT IT, SHE CRITICIZES ME FOR

918
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
EATING TOO MUCH.
IT'S LIKE THAT.

919
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
[LAUGHTER]
THAT KIND OF THING.

920
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
SHE'S ALSO MESSING WITH MY HAIR,

921
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
ALWAYS TOUCHING MY HAIR.

922
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
SHE'S A LOT LIKE MY REAL MOTHER.

923
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
IT'S LIKE SHE REALLY IS, I'VE

COMMERCIAL BREAK.

927
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000

GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT A SCENE

929
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
FROM "THE GUILTY TRIP" WITH SETH

930
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000

931
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
WE RETURN.
DON'T GO AWAY.

ANNOUNCER: THIS IS BOB,"LIVE," ]

933
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
A REGULAR GUY
WITH AN IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT.

934
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
THE USUAL, BOB?

935
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
NOT TODAY.

936
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
[ Male Announcer ]
BOB HAS AFIB:

937
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION NOT CAUSED
BY A HEART VALVE PROBLEM,

938
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
A CONDITION THAT PUTS HIM
AT GREATER RISK FOR A STROKE.

939
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
[ GPS ] TURN LEFT.

940
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I DON'T THINK SO.

941
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
[ Male Announcer ]
FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN,

942
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
AND MADE A MONTHLY TRIP TO THE
CLINIC TO GET HIS BLOOD TESTED.

943
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

944
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
BOB'S DOCTOR RECOMMENDED
A DIFFERENT OPTION:

945
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
ONCE-A-DAY XARELTO®.

946
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
XARELTO® IS THE FIRST AND ONLY

947
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
ONCE-A-DAY PRESCRIPTION
BLOOD THINNER

948
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
FOR PATIENTS WITH AFIB

949
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
NOT CAUSED
BY A HEART VALVE PROBLEM,

950
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE
ROUTINE BLOOD MONITORING.

951
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
LIKE WARFARIN,
XARELTO® IS PROVEN EFFECTIVE

952
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
TO REDUCE THE RISK
OF AN AFIB-RELATED STROKE.

953
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
THERE IS LIMITED DATA
ON HOW THESE DRUGS COMPARE

954
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
WHEN WARFARIN IS WELL MANAGED.

955
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
NO ROUTINE BLOOD MONITORING

956
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
MEANS BOB CAN SPEND HIS
EXTRA TIME HOWEVER HE LIKES.

957
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
NEW ZEALAND!

958
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
XARELTO®
IS JUST ONE PILL A DAY,

959
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
TAKEN WITH THE EVENING MEAL.

960
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
AND WITH
NO DIETARY RESTRICTIONS,

961
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
BOB CAN EAT THE HEALTHY FOODS
HE LIKES.

962
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
DO NOT STOP TAKING
XARELTO® RIVAROXABAN

963
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
WITHOUT TALKING TO THE DOCTOR
WHO PRESCRIBES IT FOR YOU.

964
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
STOPPING MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK
OF HAVING A STROKE.

965
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY

966
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
IF YOU DEVELOP ANY SIGNS
OR SYMPTOMS OF BLEEDING,

967
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING
OR TINGLING.

968
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
YOU MAY HAVE A HIGHER RISK
OF BLEEDING

969
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
IF YOU TAKE XARELTO®
WITH ASPIRIN PRODUCTS,

970
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
NSAIDS OR BLOOD THINNERS.

971
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
BEFORE TAKING XARELTO®

972
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE
ABNORMAL BLEEDING.

973
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
XARELTO® CAN CAUSE BLEEDING,
WHICH CAN BE SERIOUS,

974
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
AND RARELY MAY LEAD TO DEATH.

975
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
YOU ARE LIKELY TO BRUISE
MORE EASILY ON XARELTO®,

976
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
AND IT MAY TAKE LONGER
FOR BLEEDING TO STOP.

977
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
TELL YOUR DOCTORS
YOU ARE TAKING XARELTO®

978
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
BEFORE ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
OR DENTAL PROCEDURES.
