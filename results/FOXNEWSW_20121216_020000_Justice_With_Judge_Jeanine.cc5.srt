NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT WHICH

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
JUST YESTERDAY WAS THE SCENE

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
OF UNIMAGINABLE HORROR AND

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
GRIEF.
TODAY A COMMUNITY AND A NATION

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
STRUGGLE TO MAKE SENSE OF THE

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
INCOMPREHENSIBLE.
THE SENSELESS KILLING OF

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
INNOCENCE, CHILDREN AND THEIR

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
TEACHERS.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
WE NOW KNOW THE NAMES OF ALL

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
20 CHILDREN AGES 6 AND 7 WHO

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
WERE MURDERED IN THEIR OWN

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
CLASSROOM.
THAT PLACE WHICH SHOULD BE A

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
HAVEN OF SAFETY IN A HEARTLESS

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
WORLD.

CHARLOTTE AND DILLON, JESSE

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
AND JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO,

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
WE HEARD FROM ROBBY PARKER THE

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
REALLY LIKE TO OFFER OUR

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO ALL THE

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
AFFECTED BY THIS SHOOTING.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
IT'S A HORRIFIC TRAGEDY AND WE

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
OUR HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
OUT TO THEM.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
>> Judge Jeanine: WE'RE ALSO

WHO HELPED THEIR CLASSMATES

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
ESCAPE.
OF THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL WHO

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
RUSHED THE GUNMAN IN AN EFFORT

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
TO PROTECT HER SCHOOL.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
OF A TEACHER WHO PUT HERSELF

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
IN BETWEEN HER STUDENTS AND

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
THE GUNMAN TO PROTECT HER

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000

A PRESS CONFERENCE A SHORT

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
TIME AGO GIVING US HORRIFYING

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
INSIGHT INTO WHAT HAPPENED AT

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
THAT SCHOOL IN THOSE LAST

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
MOMENTS.
OUR OWN MOLLY LINE WAS AT THAT

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
PRESS CONFERENCE.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
MOLLY, TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.
>> THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
RELEASED A LOT OF DETAILS

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
TODAY AND THEY REALLY SPEAK OF

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
CLARITY WITH JUST HOW HORRIBLE

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
THIS SITUATION WAS.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
HE ESSENTIALLY MADE VERY CLEAR

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THAT THE VICTIM SUFFERED

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
MULTIPLE GUNSHOT WOUNDS AT THE

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
HANDS OF A LONG GUN, A RIFLE

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
HE CLARIFIED WHEN HE WAS ASKED

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
TO CLARIFY.

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
WE KNOW THAT HE PARTICIPATED

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
IN A NUMBER OF THOSE EXAMS

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
HIMSELF OF THE VICTIMS, OF

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THESE LOVED ONES, AND THAT OF

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THOSE HE EXAMINED THEY

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
SUFFERED 3 TO 11 GUNSHOT

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
WOUNDS.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUCH

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
LITTLE CHILDREN, THE YOUNGEST

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
TO SAVE THEIR OWN LIVES AND

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
THESE WOMEN, SIX WOMEN GUNNED

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
DOWN THAT WERE TRYING TO SAVE

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
THE CHILDREN.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
>> Judge Jeanine: YOU KNOW,

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
WHAT WAS INTERESTING IN THAT
PRESS CONFERENCE IS ALSO THE

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
FACT THAT HE SAID ALTHOUGH HE

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
IS A CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER,

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
THIS IS THE WORST THAT HE HAS

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
EVER SEEN.
>> HE SAYS HE HAS WORKED ABOUT

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
A THIRD OF A CENTURY IN HIS

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
LIFE DOING MEDICAL EXAMS.

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
THIS IS THE WORST HE HAS SEEN

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
AND THE WORST THAT ALL HIS

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
COLLEAGUES HAVE SEEN.

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE NATURE

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
OF THIS.
JUST HEARING ABOUT IT, WHAT WE

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
HAVE SEEN HERE ON THE SCENE,

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
THE EMOTION OF THE COMMUNITY,

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
BUT HE HAS PHYSICALLY SEEN IT

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
HIMSELF.
THEY ASKED IF HE HAD BROKEN

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
DOWN YET IF HE HAD CRIED

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
ABOUT.

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
THIS HE SAID SO FAR HE HASN'T.

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
HE SAID SO FAR HE HASN'T.

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
>> Judge Jeanine: CLEARLY A

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
BIG ISSUE WILL BE, YOU KNOW,

124
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE BY ALL

125
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
THESE FIRST RESPONDERS, POLICE

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000

TOMORROW.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
THAT?
>> THE DETAILS HAVEN'T BEEN

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
NAILED DOWN EXACTLY BUT

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS EXPECTED TO

133
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
MAKE A VISIT TO THE TOWN TO

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000

SOME VIGILS HELD AGAINST THIS

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
COMMUNITY SINCE THE MASSACRE

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
HAS OCCURRED.

140
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
EVERYONE PULLING TOGETHER.
THE NEWTOWN HAS PULLED

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
TOGETHER.
THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY HAS

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
PULLED TOGETHER.

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
THIS JUST SHOWS THAT THE

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
ENTIRE COUNTRY IS INVOLVED IN

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE.

146
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER TRAGEDY.

147
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
NOT JUST NEWTOWN AND NOT JUST

148
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
CONNECTICUT.

149
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
>> Judge Jeanine: ALL RIGHT,

150
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
MOLLY, THANKS SO MUCH.

151
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000

REACTION FROM THE PEOPLE OF

155
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
THIS SMALL TOWN IN

156
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
CONNECTICUT.

157
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
MIKE?
>> AND, JUDGE, THIS IS A NIGHT

158
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
WHEN THE PAIN OF THIS TRAGEDY

159
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
IS REFRESHED.

160
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE'RE

161
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
LEARNING NOW THE NAMES AND THE

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
FACES OF THE SMALLEST VICTIMS

163
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
OF THIS UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY.

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
NAMES LIKE 7-YEAR-OLD GRACE

165
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
MCDONALD WHOSE FAMILY SAID SHE

166
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
WAS THE LOVE AND LIFE OF THAT

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
FAMILY.

168
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
6-YEAR-OLD EMILY PARKER, WHO

169
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
SAID GOOD BY TO HER FATHER

170
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
BEFORE HE WENT OFF TO WORK.

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
>> SHE WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
AND I HAD ACTUALLY BEEN

173
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
TEACHING HER PORTUGUESE.

174
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
OUR LAST CONVERSATION WAS IN

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
PORTUGUESE.

176
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
AND SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING.

177
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
AND ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

178
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I SAID I WAS DOING WELL.

179
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME,

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
AND I GAVE HER A KISS AND I

181
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
WAS OUT THE DOOR.

182
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
>> SADLY FAMILIAR, THE

183

THE PEOPLE HERE ARE DRAWING ON

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

192

FOCUS ON THE KIDS AND TRY TO

199
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
GET THEM THROUGH THIS.

MAKE SURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN

236
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
A RELATIVELY SAFE AREA OF THE

252
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
NORMAL ROUTINE.

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
WE'RE TRYING TO GET IN YOU

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
WE DO ASK HIM AND HE DOES ASK

257
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BAD

258
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
PERSON.

AND YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY WAS

260
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT.

261
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
HE WAS FEARFUL OF EVEN GOING

262
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
HOME AFTER WE LEFT THE

263
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
HE IS GETTING BETTER BUT HE IS

266
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
STILL AFRAID OF BAD PEOPLE.

267
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
>> Judge Jeanine: ROBERT, I
ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE

268
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
A 7-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WHO WAS

269
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
IN THE CAFETERIA ACTUALLY IN

270
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
LEAVING THE SCHOOL SAW THE

271
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
BODIES OF THESE CHILDREN?

272
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
>> WELL, IT'S HER CLASSROOM

273
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
WAS NEAR THE CAFETERIA.

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
SHE WAS IN HER ROOM WITH HER

275
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
TEACHER AND FELLOW STUDENTS IN

276
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
A DIFFERENT SECTION OF THE

277
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
BUILDING ON -- YEAH.

278
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
BUT SHE DID AS I'M SURE MANY

279
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
OF THE CHILDREN DID BEAR

280
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
WITNESS TO VERY HORRIFIC

281
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
THINGS.

282
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
BUT, YEAH, SHE DID SEE SOME

283
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
BODIES THERE, YEAH.

284
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
>> Judge Jeanine: FINALLY, I

285
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR SON

286
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
UNDERSTANDABLY, ADEN, WHO SAW

287
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
HIS TEACHER BEING SHOT, IS

288
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
RELUCTANT TO BE SEPARATED FROM

289
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
THE FAMILY OR FROM YOU.

290
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I IMAGINE THAT THAT'S NOT

291
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
SURPRISING?
>> YEAH.

292
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
SO WE'RE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE

293
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000

OF OUR FAMILY AND OUR

296
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
NEIGHBORS.
WE'RE STAYING CLOSE.

297
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT TODAY

298
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000

299
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000

HIS.
AT HIS FRIEND'S HOUSE.

301
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
SO AS LONG AS HE IS SOMEWHERE

302
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
WHERE HE FEELS SAFE, IT'S A

303
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
GOOD THING.

304
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT HE

305
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
WANTS TO KNOW WE'RE CLOSE BY

306
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
THOUGHTS?

374
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
>> THE TOWN IS, AS EVERYBODY

375
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
HAS HEARD ACROSS THE COUNTRY

376
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
AND THE WORLD, THE TOWN IS

377
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
JUST A GREAT GREAT TOWN AND

378
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
WHAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T

379
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING LIKE THIS

380
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
NEVER HAPPENS, ESPECIALLY IN

381
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
OUR TOWN.

382
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
THEY NEED TO BE AWARE BUT

383
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
BASICALLY WE HAVE A REVERSED

384
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
911 SYSTEM RECALL ANY EVENTS

385
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
THAT HAPPENED.

386
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
AND IF YOU SEE THAT AND I

387
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
FIRST HEARD THAT THERE WAS A

388
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
POSSIBLE SHOOTING.

389
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
AND SO, KNOW, WHAT'S RUN

390
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
THROUGH YOUR MIND OBVIOUSLY

391
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
YOUR MIND JUST RACES AND YOUR

392
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
ADRENALINE GOES RIGHT TO YOUR

393
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
HEAD.
SO BASICALLY I WAS AT MY

400
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I HAD A SENSE OF RELIEF BEFORE

401
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I ACTUALLY GOT THERE UNTIL I

402
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
ACTUALLY SAW HER I WASN'T

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000

YEAH!

572
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
THAT'S A PAIR OF SHOES.

573
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
SEE FOR YOURSELF IF YOU COULD
SAVE ON THEIFTS YOU WANT.

574
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
WALMART.

575
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
often comes with a set

576
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
of equally impressive
instructions ?

577
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Shouldn't something
that's truly advanced,

578
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
not need much explanation
at all ?

579
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
With the Nokia Lumia 822
on Verizon,

580
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
there's not much to learn

581
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
because it's
powered by Windows...

582
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
to let you do more than you ever
imagined on your smartphone.

583
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000

a feature that makes
the most of your plan.

585
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Only on Verizon.

586
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
>> WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE

587
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
POINT OF ENTRY.

588
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I CAN TELL YOU IT HE WAS NOT

589
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
VOLUNTARILY LET INTO THE

590
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
SCHOOL AT ALL.

591
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
THAT HE FORCED HIS WAY INTO

592
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
THE SCHOOL.
THAT'S AS FAR AS WE CAN GO ON

593
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
THAT.

594
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
>> Judge Jeanine: YESTERDAY'S
MASSACRE WAS JUST THE LATEST

595
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
INCIDENT OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE

596
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS

597
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
COUNTRY.

598
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

599
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
HAD SAFETY MEASURES IN PLACE,

600
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
BUT THE SHOOTER WAS STILL ABLE

601
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
TO GAIN ENTRY WHICH RAISES THE

602
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
QUESTION HOW SAFE ARE OUR

603
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
SCHOOLS AND HOW SAFE ARE OUR

604
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
CHILDREN?

605
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
WITH ME IS FAIRFIELD COUNTY

606
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
POLICE CHIEF GARY MCNAMARA.

607
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

608
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

609
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
>> YOU ARE A POLICE CHIEF JUST

610
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
30 MILES FROM HERE.

611
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
>> JUST A LITTLE SOUTH OF

612
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
NEWTOWN, YEAH.

613
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
>>
>> Judge Jeanine: YOU ARE

614
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
FAMILIAR WITH THE ISSUE OF

615
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
SCHOOL VIOLENCE AND SCHOOL
SAFETY IN CONNECTICUT.

616
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
>> I AM.

617
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
>> CONNECTICUT IS A SMALL

618
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
STATE.
SO YOU KNOW THE CHIEFS OF

619
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
POLICE IN THE AREA REALLY GET

620
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
TOGETHER.
SO ANY TIME ANYTHING HAPPENS

621
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
WE REALLY DO COME TOGETHER AND

622
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
DISSECT IT TOGETHER.

623
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
>> Judge Jeanine: CHIEF, WHAT
IS MANDATED.

624
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
IS CONNECTICUT, IS THERE

625
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
ANYTHING THAT'S REQUIRED OF

626
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
THIS STATE?

627
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
>> THERE IS, ALL SCHOOLS HAVE

628
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
TO HAVE A CRISIS PLAN IN

629
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
PLACE.

630
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
AND THEN EVERY THREE MONTHS

631
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
AFTER COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL IN

632
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
2000, THEY HAVE TO -- EVERY

633
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
THREE MONTHS PUT THAT PLAN

634
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
INTO PLACE.

635
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT, THE

636
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS HAVE TO

637
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
WORK WITH LOCAL LAW

638
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
ENFORCEMENT EVERY THREE

639
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
MONTHS.
SORT OF LIKE A FIRE DRILL TO

640
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN TO ENSURE

641
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
--
>> -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THESE

642
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
CHILDREN ACTUALLY HAD GONE

643
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
THROUGH SOME OF THE FIRE
DRILLS AND THEY HAD DONE THAT.

644
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
BUT THE ISSUE OF SAFETY AND

645
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
THE THREAT ASSESSMENT, I MEAN,

646
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

647
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
MANDATE THAT EVERY SCHOOL HAVE

648
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
A THREAT ASSESSMENT DONE

649
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
REGARDING SAFETY?
>> WELL, I THINK THERE IS SOME

650
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
SORT OF A MANDATE.

651
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
AND I'M NOT REALLY FAMILIAR

652
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
WITH HOW HEAVY THAT MANDATE

653
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
IS.
BUT I THINK GIVEN THE

654
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
ATMOSPHERE.
IT'S A PUBLIC MANDATE.

655
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A THREAT

656
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
ASSESSMENT IN EACH SCHOOL.

657
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
>> Judge Jeanine: WHO DECIDES,
CHIEF, HOW MUCH SAFETY IS

658
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
IMPLEMENTED AT A PARTICULAR

659
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
SCHOOL.
>> I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE

660
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

661
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
IT DEPENDS ON THE LAW

662
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
ENFORCEMENT AND THE DESIGN OF

663
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
THE SCHOOL.

664
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
HOW OLD THE SCHOOLS ARE.

665
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
>> Judge Jeanine: IT'S REALLY

666
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
THE LOCALS WHO DECIDE THIS?

667
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
>> IT COMES DOWN FROM THE

668
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
STATE.
SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN GO TO THE

669
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
STATE POLICE AND GO TO THE

670
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
STATE FOR THREAT ASSESSMENT.

671
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
>> Judge Jeanine: ALL RIGHT.
AND FINALLY THIS IS NOT THE

672
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
FIRST TIME THAT THIS STATE HAS

673
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
DEALT WITH THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL

674
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
VIOLENCE.

675
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
>> IT HAS NOT.
WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SOMETHING

676
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
IN FAIRFIELD BACK IN 2

677
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
CLASSROOM FULL OF STUDENTS

678
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
HELD HOSTAGE FOR A PERIOD OF 8

679
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
HOURS.
THANKFULLY NOBODY WAS INJURED

680
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
AS THE CASE HERE.

681
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
IT TOUCHES ALL OF US.

682
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
CONNECTICUT IS A SMALL STATE.

683
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
WE ARE ALL HERE HELPING

684
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
TOGETHER.

685
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
>> Judge Jeanine: UNFORTUNATELY

686
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
WE HAD MANY DIE IN JUST OVER
THE WOODS BEHIND ME RIGHT NOW.

687
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
CHIEF, FINALLY, VERY QUICKLY,

688
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS COULD

689
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
HAVE BEEN PREVENTED?

690
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
>> YOU KNOW, GIVEN THE MINIMUM

691
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
FACTS I HAVE, I DON'T THINK IT

692
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED.

693
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> I THINK WE HAVE SAVED A LOT

694
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
MORE KIDS THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN

695
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
DONE IF THERE WERE NO PLANS IN

696
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
PLACE.
>> I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO WORK

697
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
A LITTLE HARDER THOUGH.

698
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
CHIEF MCNAMARA THANK YOU FOR

699
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
BEING WITH US THIS EVENING.

700
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> COMING UP:  WHO WAS THIS

701
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
SHOOTER WHO LITERALLY

702
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
UNLEASHED HELL AT AN

703
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

704
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
COMING UP INSIDE THE MIND OF A

705
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
KILLER.

706
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
There is no
mass-produced human.

707
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So we created the
extraordinarily

708
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
comfortable Sleep Number

709
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
around a bed with DualAir

710
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000

your body needs - each of

711
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
your bodies.

712
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Our sleep professionals will
help you find

713
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
your sleep number setting.

714
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Exclusively at a Sleep

715
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Sleep Number.

716
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Comfort individualized.

717
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
This holiday season, give
the gift that's magical:

718
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
the innovative AirFit
adjustable pillow at

719

special 30% savings.

720
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
>> HE WAS DIFFERENT, HE WAS

721
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
QUIET.
NICE KID.
GOOD KID.

722
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I MEAN, HE WAS DEFINITELY

723
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
CHALLENGE THE FAMILY IN THAT

724
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
HOUSE.

725
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
EVERY FAMILY HAS ONE.
I HAVE ONE.

726
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
THEY HAVE ONE.

727
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
BUT NEVER IN TROUBLE WITH THE

728
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
LAW.

729
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
NEVER IN TROUBLE WITH

730
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
ANYTHING.

731
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I KNOW SHE HAD ISSUES WITH

732
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
SCHOOL.
SHE EVENTUALLY WOUND UP HOME

733
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
SCHOOLING HIM.
SHE BATTLED WITH THE SCHOOL

734
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
DISTRICT.

735
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
IN WHAT CAPACITY I'M NOT 100%

736
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
CERTAIN IF IT WAS BEHAVIOR OR

737
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
LEARNING DISABILITIES, I

738
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
REALLY DON'T KNOW BUT IS HE A

739
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
VERY VERY BRIGHT BOY.

740
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
HE IS SMART.

741
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
>> Judge Jeanine: IT DOESN'T

742
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
MAKE SENSE.

743
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

744
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
SHOOTER.
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU MY

745
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
BACKGROUND, I'M REALLY NOT SO

746
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
INTERESTED IN THE MENTAL STATE

747
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
OF THE SHOOTER.
I'M INTERESTED IN THE VICTIM.

748
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'M INTERESTED IN THE PEOPLE

749
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
WHO NEVER CHOSE TO BE A VICTIM

750
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
IN THE FIRST PLACE AS OPPOSED

751
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
TO GUY WHO MAKES A A DECISION

752
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
TO DRESS UP IN BLACK GARB AND

753
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
A MILITARY VEST AND TAKE A

754
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
LONG GUN AND TWO

755
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
SEMIAUTOMATICS AND COME INTO
THE SCHOOL WHERE THE MOST

756
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
VULNERABLE VICTIMS IN OUR

757
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
SOCIETY ARE AND TAKE THEIR

758
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
LIVES.
TO ME, THE ISSUE OF THE STATE

759
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
OF MIND OF THE CRIMINAL IS NOT

760
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
SO MUCH ABOUT HIS STATE OF

761
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
MIND BUT ABOUT HIS CHOICE.

762
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
HE IS THE ONE WHO CHOSE TO

763
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
PICK UP A GUN.

764
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
HE IS THE ONE WHO CHOSE TO

765
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
MAKE A DECISION TO KILL.

766
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
BUT HAVING SAID THAT, MY

767
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
PROSECUTOR BACKGROUND I WILL

768
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
NOW PUT ON HOLD AND I WILL ASK

769
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
AND FIRST OF ALL INTRODUCE

770
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
DR. JOHN SHARP, WHO IS A

771
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
PSYCHIATRIST ON THE FACULTY OF

772
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
THE HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,

773
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
DR. SHARP, SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU

774
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
HERE.
YOU HEARD ME RAMP, I DON'T

775
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
MUCH CARE ABOUT THIS GUY'S

776
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
STATE OF MIND.

777
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I CARE ABOUT THE VICTIMS.

778
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THE VICTIM'S FAMILY THE RIPPLE

779
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
EFFECT.
THE FACT THAT THIS TOWN WILL

780
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
FOREVER BEAR THE INSIGNIFICANT

781
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
ANY I CAN'T INSIGNIA THAT

782
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
HAPPENS HERE.

783
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT GRIEVING

784
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
AND.

785
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
>> I'M A PARENT.

786
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I DROP THEM OFF AT THAT SCHOOL

787
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WOULD

788
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
LEARN TO BE SAFE.

789
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
WHAT AM I FEELING RIGHT NOW?

790
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
>> YOU ARE FEELING ANGRY.

791
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
YOU ARE FEELING SCARED.

792
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
YOU ARE FEELING SO MANY

793
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
DIFFERENT EMOTIONS IT'S HARD

794
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
TO KEEP THEM STRAIGHT.

795
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
EVERYONE WOKE UP TODAY TO THE

796
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
WORST NIGHTMARE TO EVEN

797
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
IMAGINE THAN WHEN THEY WENT TO

798
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
BED LAST NIGHT.

799
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
WHAT PARENTS HAVE TO DO IS

800
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
PROVIDE A SENSE OF SAFETY FOR

801
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
THEIR CHILDREN.

802
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
>> Judge Jeanine: BUT THEY

803
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
DIDN'T.
DO THEY LIVE WITH GUILT?

804
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
HOW DO THEY RESOLVE WHAT THEY

805
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
HAVE GONE THROUGH?

806
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
HOW DO THEY PROTECT THEIR OWN

807
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
CHILDREN.
>> WHAT WE KNOW TWO DIFFERENT

808
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
THINGS.

809
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
THAT DOESN'T MAKE US FEEL

810
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
BETTER OR SAFE WHEN WE

811
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
CONSIDER DROPPING OUR KID

812
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
SOMEWHERE OR GOING TO A MALL.

813
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WE

814
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
CAN SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER AND

815
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
RECREATE A SENSE OF SAFETY.

816
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
AND MAKE SURE THE KIDS FEEL

817
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THAT WAIT A MINUTE KIDS CAN BE

818
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
MORE RESILIENT THAN ADULTS

819
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
EVEN.

820
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
>> Judge Jeanine: I HE AGREE KIS

821
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
ARE MORE RESILIENT.

822
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
WE JUST SPOKE WITH A FATHER

823
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
WHOSE 6-YEAR-OLD IS AFRAID TO

824
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
HAVE HIM LEAVE HIM SIDE.

825
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
>> THAT'S A NORMAL RESPONSE.

826
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
RESPOND TO WHAT YOU ARE SEEING

827
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
IN YOUR CHILDREN.

828
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
IT'S DIFFERENT IF YOU ARE
TALKING TO A 6-YEAR-OLD OR A

829
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
PRETEEN OR TEEN.

830
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
6-YEAR-OLD IS VERY CONCRETE.

831
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
YOU WANT TO SEE THOUSAND THEY

832
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
ARE FEELING.

833
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
MAKE SURE THEY FEEL SAFE.

834
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
OBSERVE THEM AND COMFORT THEM.

835
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
PRETEENS GET CAUGHT UP IN

836
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
MORALITY.

837
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
VERY BLACK AND WHITE.

838
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
MAKE SURE THEY ARE THINKING

839
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
RIGHT.

840
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
>> Judge Jeanine: WHAT ABOUT
THE KIDS WHO ARE WATCHING

841
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
TELEVISION AND SHOULD PARENTS

842
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

843
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
SITUATION TO TALK TO THEIR

844
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
CHILDREN AND SAY THIS IS WHAT

845
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
YOU SHOULD DO OR THIS IS, YOU

846
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
KNOW, WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

847
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
WORLD?
>> ESPECIALLY THEY ARE TEENAGE

848
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
YEARS.
THE YOUNGER I THINK LESS

849
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
EXPOSURE THE BETTER.

850
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
ALL OF US CAN OVERDOSE ON

851
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
TELEVISION.
WE SHOULDN'T OVERDO IT IN ANY

852
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
WAY.
WE SHOULDN'T OVERDRINK OR

853
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
EXERCISE OR ISOLATE.

854
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
WE SHOULD TRY TO BE MOD

855
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
DEMOCRAT AND IN COMMUNICATION

856
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
WITH ONE ANOTHER AND OPEN TO

857
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
RECEIVE WHATEVER SUPPORT IS

858
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
GOING TO HELP US.

859
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
COUNSELORS, RELIGIOUS SUPPORT.

860
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
ONE ANOTHER.

861
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
>> WELL, OKAY.

862
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE

863
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
CHILDREN AND THE PARENTS WHO

864
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
CLEAR LIVE WILL GO INTO A

865
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
DEPRESSION?
>> WELL, THAT CAN BE TREATED.

866
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
SO I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

867
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
THINK THAT THAT'S A FAILURE.

868
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
WE DON'T THINK OF THAT OF ANY

869
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
KIND OF A SHORT OR MORAL

870
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
UPCOMING.

871
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
THAT'S VERY TREATABLE.

872
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE

873
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
SHOOTER HERE.

874
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
HE PLAY HAVE HAD A CONDITION

875
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
TOO.

876
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
ANYBODY SUFFERING NOW CAN BE
TREATED AND MOVE TOWARD

877
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
HEALING.

878
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
>> Judge Jeanine: FINAL
QUESTION BEFORE I GO TO

879
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
DR. BARBARA KERWIN A FORENSIC

880
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
PSYCHOLOGIST SITTING IN NEW
YORK CITY NOW.

881
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE SAY CAN THIS

882
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
KIND OF THING BE PREVENTED AND

883
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
YOU THINK THAT MAYBE IT CAN

884
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
BE, IF YOU KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT

885
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
THE INDIVIDUAL.

886
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
YOU KNOW, MY QUESTION REALLY

887
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
IS WHY IS THE WORLD SO

888
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
DIFFERENT TODAY?

889
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
WHY ARE PEOPLE DOING THIS?

890
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
WHY IS THIS BECOMING THE NORM?

891
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE THE

892
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
ONE ANSWER FOR THAT.

893
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
PEOPLE THINK THAT THERE IS A

894
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
TOO MUCH OF CULTURE OF

895
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
VIOLENCE.
PEOPLE ARE TOO ISOLATED IN

896
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
THEIR OWN MINDS.

897
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM ISN'T

898
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE.

899
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
LOVING EMBRACE THAT INSISTED

900
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
ON THERAPY OF A MEANINGFUL

901
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
SORT THAT HE COULD HAVE

902
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
ACCESSED AND AFFORD COULD HAVE

903
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
AVOIDED THIS.

904
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
>> DOCTOR, THANKS SO MUCH FOR

905
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
BEING WITH US THIS EVENING.

906
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
KNOW, DOCTOR, YOU RAN THE UNIT

907
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
FOR THE VIOLENT CRIMINALLY

908
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
INSANE AT CREED MORE.

909
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
SO YOU HAVE GOT A LOT OF

910
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
EXPERIENCE WITH THIS KIND OF

911
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
THING.
WERE THERE A TELL TALE SIGNS

912
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
OR ARE THERE PREDICTABLE

913
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
ISSUES OR FACTORS THAT WOULD

914
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
IDENTIFY THIS INDIVIDUAL AS A

915
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
DANGEROUS INDIVIDUAL.

916
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
>> WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH HIM

917
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
IS THE STORY THAT WE SEE AGAIN

918
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
AND AGAIN WITH THESE COINS OF

919
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
CREEPY PEOPLE THAT GO IN AND

920
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
UNLEASH THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE.

921
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
HE WAS THE LONER, HE DIDN'T

922
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000

UNTIL THAT STEP IS MET, THEN

1104
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
YOU CAN'T GO FORWARD WITH A

BARRICADE.

1111
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
AND MAKE IT A HARDER TARGET

1112
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW EVERY

00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000

00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
TO FIND YOUR KID.

1285
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
IDENTIFY WHERE YOURS IS AND

1286
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
MAKING SURE THEY ARE SAFE.

1287
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
FIND OUT WHAT THE SITUATION

1288
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
WAS.
>> SHE WAS IN A SMALL CLASS.

1289
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
A READING GROUP AND THEY

1290
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
STARTED HEARING, I GUESS,

1291
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
BANGS.

1292
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
AND HER TEACHER WHICH I'M SO

1293
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
GRATEFUL FOR, THERE WAS JUST A

1294
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
SMALL GROUP, THEY RUSHED THE

1295
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
KIDS INTO THE BATHROOM, AND

1296
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
THEY LOCKED THE DOOR.

1297
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
AND THEY JUST TOLD THE

1298
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
CHILDREN THAT IT WAS HAMMERING

1299
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
AND TRIED TO KEEP THEM CALM.

1300
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
THE NEXT THING I KNOW BECAUSE

1301
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET THE

1302
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
COMPLETE STORY.

1303
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
THE NEXT THING I KNOW IS THAT

1304
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
THE POLICE CAME IN AND THEY

1305
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
WERE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR TO

1306
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
BE LET OUT.

1307
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
OF THE CLASSROOM.

1308
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
AND WHEN THEY WERE, SHE HAD

1309
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
SEEN GLASS AND BLOOD.

1310
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
ONE CHILD WAS COVERED IN BLOOD

1311
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT CHILD IS

1312
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
SAFE AND WAS NOT HURT AND MUST

1313
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY ELSE'S.

1314
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
>> IT'S SHEAR TERROR AND A

1315
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
SENSE OF IMMEDIATE URGENCY.

1316
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
AND, YOU KNOW, TO GET TO YOUR

1317
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
CHILD AND TO BE THERE TO

1318
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
PROTECT THEM.

1319
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
>> 18 CHILDREN PRONOUNCED DEAD

1320
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
AT THE SCHOOL.

1321
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
THERE WERE TWO THAT WERE

1322
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
TRANSPORTED TO AREA HOSPITALS

1323
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
AND PRONOUNCED DEAD AT AREA

1324
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
HOSPITALS.
THERE WERE SIX ADULTS

1325
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE

1326
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
AT THE SCHOOL.

1327
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
>> WE HAVE ENDURED TOO MANY OF

1328
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
THESE TRAGEDIESED IN THE PAST
FEW YEARS.

1329
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
AND EACH TIME I LEARN THE

1330
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
NEWS, I REACT NOT AS A

1331
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
PRESIDENT BUT AS ANYBODY ELSE

1332
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
WOULD, AS A PARENT.

1333
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE

1334
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
TODAY.
I KNOW THERE IS NOT A PARENT

1335
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
IN AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL

1336
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
THE SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF

1337
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
THAT I DO.

1338
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

1339
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.
