108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
IN AN AREA WHERE THE MORNING

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000

SEE WHERE THE HOME WAS AND TO

219
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
WHERE THE SWAT TEEMS AND

220
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000

WHERE TO GO TO BEGIN TO LOOK

230
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
FOR CLUES AND WHY ADAM LANZA

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
WOULD HAVE PARTICIPATING IN

232
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
THIS.

233
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
AND THEY WERE LOOKING FOR

234
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000

WANT TO BEAR AND IT WAS

363
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
HEARTBREAKING TO HAVE TO HEAR

CHILDREN WERE NOT COMING HOME.

366
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
IT WAS HEART BREAKING FOR THE

367
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO GO

368
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000

375
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT.

376
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
SUFFICE TO SAY THERE WERE

377
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000

AND THE INTERNET START TOD

562
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
PUBLISH RYAN PICTURES AND THEY

563
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
CALLED HIM THE KILLER.

564
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
AT THAT VERY MOMENT I TALKED

565
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
TO SOME OF HIS FRIENDS BY TEXT

566
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
AND PHONE AND THEY TOLD ME, I

567
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
POKE TO THREE OF HIS FRIENDS

568
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
AND THEY HAD SPOKEN TO HIM

569
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
BRIEFLY ON BOOK BOOK CHAT OR

570
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
BY PHONE AND HE WAS IN FACT AT

571
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
WORK AND NOT THE KILLER .

572
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
IT WAS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE

573
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
FOR HIM TO BE IN NEWTOWN WHILE

574
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
HE WAS AT WORK AND TALKING ON

575
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
THE PHONE TO HIS FRIENDS.

576
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
>> BUT YOU KNOW.

577
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
>> YES?

578
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
>> DO YOU KNOW IF HIS FRIENDS,

579
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
DID ANY OF RYAN'S FRIEND EVER

580
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
MET ADAM?

581
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
>> NOT THE ONES THAT I SPOKE

582
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
TO.

583
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
THEY KNEW HE HAD A BROTHER AND

584
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
THAT IS ABOUT THE EXTENT OF

585
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
THEIR KNOWLEDGE.

586
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
THEY HAD BRIEF CONVERSATIONS

587
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
WITH HIM TODAY AS YOU CAN

588
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
IMAGINE IT WAS A CRAZY DAY FOR

589
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
HIM SO THEY JUST HAD A FEW

590
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
MINUTES AND THEY KNEW HE HAD A

591
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
BROTHER BUT NONE OF THEM

592
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
SEEMED TO KNOW ADAM.

593
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
>> DID THEY KNOW ANYTHING

594
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
ABOUT ADAM, DID RYAN EVER PEEK

595
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
ABOUT ADAM OR DESCRIBE UNUSUAL

596
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
OR NOT UNUSUAL OR A

597
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM OR

598
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
ANYTHING?

599
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
>> THERE IS VERY LITTLE

600
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THAT.

601
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
ONE OF HIS FRIENDS DID TELL ME

602
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
IN FACT, HE HAD A BROTHER AND

603
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A

604
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
LITTLE CHALLENGED, AND

605
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
DEVELOPMENTALLY CHALLENGED BUT
THAT IS ALL OF THE

606
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
INFORMATION.
OTHER INFORMATION IS VERY

607
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
SPARSE.
HIS FRIENDS DIDN'T SEEM TO

608
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
KNOW HIS FAMILY OR AT LEAST

609
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
THEY DIDN'T MENTION THAT

610
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
TODAY.

611
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MORE

612
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
INFORMATION.
>> I AM SORRY ONE MORE TIME

613
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
GRETA?

614
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
NBEYOND MENTALLY CHALLENGED

615
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE

616
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
ABOUT ADAM?

617
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
NNOT ABOUT ADAM, NOT ABOUT

618
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
ADAM.

619
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
WE HEARD EARLIER TODAY THAT

620
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
ADAM COULD HAVE HAD RYAN'S

621
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
IDENTIFICATION ON HIM.

622
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
RYAN TOLD ONE OF HIS FRIENDS

623
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
THAT THE CONFUSION AROSE THAT

624
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
WAY AND IT WAS PROBABLY ADAM

625
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
RATHER THAN HIMSELF.

626
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
BUT OTHER THAN THAT THERE WAS

627
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT ADAM

628
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
HERE IN HOBOKEN.

629
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
>> THANK YOU.

630
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
>> COMING UP.
IT TOOK ONLY MINUTES FOR THE

631
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
KILLER TO GUN DOWN 20 CHILDREN

632
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
AND 6 ADULTS.

633
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
OUR LIVE COVERAGE IN

634
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
CONNECTICUT CONTINUES, THAT'S

635
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
NEXT .

636
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
...so as you can see, GEICO's
customer satisfaction is at 97%.

637
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Mmmm tasty.

638
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And cut! Very good.

639
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

640
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

641
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

642
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It's not real.

643
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

644
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

645
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

646
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

647
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
>> UNTHINKABLE TRAGEDY

648
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
UNFOLDED.

649
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000

00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
DIFFICULT TO SEE THE WAT THEM

666
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
THAT WAS RESPONDING.

667
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000

AND TWO REPORTS SAID THAT ONE

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
GUNMAN MAY BE DEAD .

674
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
IT IS A FAST-MOVE FLUID

675
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
SITUATION IN THE SCHOOL .

676
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000

PARENTS CERTAINLY DO.

683
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
FEELING ENORMOUS SYMPATHY FOR

684
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
THE FAMILIES THAT ARE

685
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000

686
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000

MUCH WORSE.

698
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
>> THE SHOOTER MAY A YOUNG MAN

699
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
20 YEARS OLD AND HE MAY LIVE

700
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000

THAT PERSON'S HOME.

705
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
WE ARE TRYING TO CONFIRM THAT.

706
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
WE DON'T KNOW THE IDENTITY OF

707
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
THE GUNMAN .

708
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000

718
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000

962
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
YOUR WIFE OR MOTHER OR FATHER

963

GOING ON.
WE KNOW WHO THE SHOOTER IS.

970
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
HE SHOT HIMSELF IN THE HEAD

971
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000

CO-DEFENDANT OR SOMEONE WHO

973
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
HELPED HIM AND YOU WILL HAVE

974
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
TO PUT A CASE TOGETHER; IS

975
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
THAT WHY THEY DO THIS?

976
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000

977
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000

FOR LEGAL PURPOSES AND

981
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
CERTAINLY THERE COULD BE CIVIL

ACTIONS IF THERE IS NOT

983
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
CRIMINAL.
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS

984
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
SUSPECT WAS DESCRIBED AS

985
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
SOMEONE WHO MIGHT HAVE MENTAL

986

987
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000

988
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
HAVE BEEN FORMULATED BY

989

IT IS REALLY WHAT I AM TALKING

993

994
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
PUT HIM UP AND GAVE HIM

995

INFORMATION AND COMPLETED THE

996
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000

AND THEN YOU WOULD NEED TO

997
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
PROSECUTE THAT INDIVIDUAL.

998
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
SO IT NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE

999
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
