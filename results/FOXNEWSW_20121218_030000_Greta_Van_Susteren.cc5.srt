889
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
GOOD EVENING.
ANY PROBLEM WITH THE SECRETARY

890
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
NOT TESTIFYING?

891
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
>> WELL, I THINK SHE WILL HAVE

892
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
TO TESTIFY AT SOME POINT.

893
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
YOU KNOW EVERY FOREIGN SERVICE

ABOUT TO USE.

00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
EVINT.

900
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
YOU HAVE A DIPLOMATIC ILLNESS

901
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
AND THIS IS WOB - ON ONE TO

902
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
BEAT THE BAN.

903
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
IT WAS REVEALED IN A WAY THAT

904
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
WAS NOT TRANSPARENT AND I

905
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
THINK THERE IS AN OBLIGATION

906
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
HERE ESPECIALLY IF SECRETARY

907
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
CLINTON DECIDES TO RUN FOR

908
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
PRESIDENT.
SHE MAY BE TESTIFYING THIS

909
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
WEEK, BUT SHE WILL NOT ESCAPE

910
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
IT FOREVER.

911
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
>> I DON'T THINK SHE INDICATED

912
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
THAT SHE WILL NOT TESTIFY EVER

913
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT SHE

914
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
HAD THE FLU AND A WOMAN WHO

915
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
LIVED IN AN AIRPLANE FOR FOUR

916
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
YEARS REPORTED THAT SHE WAS

917
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
DEHYDRATED AND IF YOU FALL AND

918
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
GET A CONCLUSION THAT IS IT A

919
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
BRAIN INJURY.
BUT SHE DID SAY THAT SHE IS

920
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
GOING TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE

921
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000

DEPARTMENT HAVE TO TURN OVER

926
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
THE ENTIRE SUMMARY AND THAT IS

927
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
IT A POSITIVE STEP FORWARD.

928
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
IT IS IT TIME THAT THE

929
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE FIPED OUT.

930
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I DON'T LIKE THAT IT IS DONE

931
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
CLOSED DOORS ON WEDNESDAY .

932
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
THERE IS SOME ASPECTS THAT ARE

933
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
CLASSIFIED AND SOME ARE NOT.

934
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS

935
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
TWO HEARINGS.

936
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I TELL YOU THE SECRETARY

937
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
STAYED OUT THE PUBLIC LIME

938
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
LIGHT.
I THINK SHE WAS WAITING FOR

939
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
THE REPORT SO SHE COULD FIND

940
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
OUT WHAT IT SAID.

941
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
AND NOTHING MORE EMBARRASSING

942
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
THAN TO SAY SOMETHING AND THEN

943
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
HAVE IT CONTRADICTED AND HAVE

944
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
TO CHANGE THE STORY.

945
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
SHE HAD A CHANCE TO READ THE

946
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
REPORT AND WRITE HER TESTIMONY

947
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
AT HER LEISURE AND I THINK

948
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
THAT IS NOT TRANSPARENT,

949
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
EITHER.

950
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
>> TWO QUESTIONS.

951
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
DID SHE CHOOSE AMBASSADOR

952
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
PICKERING AND ADMIRAL MULEN

953
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
AND THAT IS THE FIRST

954
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
QUESTION.

955
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
ARE THEY GOOD AGGRESSIVE

956
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
INVESTIGATORS?

957
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
>> IF SHE PICKED TWO THAT WERE

958
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
LIGHT WEIGHTS, I WOULD BE SUS.

959
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
BUT SHE PICK TWO GOOD ONES.

960
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
>> UNDER SECRETARY FOR

961
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
MANAGEMENT PATRICK KENNEDY

962
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
PICKED THEM.

963
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I WOULD LIKE TO SO THE REPORT

964
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
BEFORE JUDGING THE

965
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
PERSONALITYINGS.

966
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
TWO EVENTS SECRETARY CLINTON

967
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
MANAGE TOD AVOID BEING IN

968
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
PUBLIC.

969
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
TWO CRITICAL POINTS SHE WAS

970
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
UNAVAILABLE.

971
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
FIRST, THE FAMOUS SUNDAY TALK

972
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
SHOWS IN FIVE DAYS AFTER THE

973
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
ATTACK.

974
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
AND AMBASSADOR RICE WROTE IN

975
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
THE WASHINGTON POST LAST WEEK,

976
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
THAT SECRETARY CLINTON WAS

977
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
UNAVAILABLE BECAUSE SHE HAD A

978
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
GRUELING WEEK.

979
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
AND THE LOSS OF HER FOUR

980
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
COLLEAGUES WOULD BE GRUELING.

981
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
BUT PRESIDENTS CAN HAVE

982
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
GRUELING WEEKS.

983
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
PRESIDENT ROOSE VET APPEARED

984
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
ON A MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND HE

985
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
HAD A GRUELING DAY.

986
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
AND IT DEPARTMENTIN

987
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
IBCAPACITATE HIM AND NOW

988
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
SENATOR CLINTON CAN'T TESTIFY

989
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
THIS WEEK.

990
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
TWO POINTS DON'T MAKE A

991
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
PATTERN BUT MAKE A LINE.

992
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE

993
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000

994
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000

995

SUBPEONAS FOR EVERYONE.

996
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000

997

FEET TO THE FIRE AND I WOULD

998
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
HAVE SUBPEONED ERCH. THAT IS

999
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
JUST ME.

1000
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000

I DON'T KNOW THEY CAN MAKE IT

I THINK ADMINISTRATION IS

1038
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
GOING TO HAVE TO GET INVOLVED

1039
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000

MATTER OF A CONVERSATION.

1058
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000

1065
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
ENSURE HIS PERSONAL SAFETY TO

1068
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000

1069
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
THEY'RE CHECKING ON HIM TO BE

1070
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
SURE HE'S GETTING FED.

1071
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
TO TALK TO HIM, YOU KNOW?

1072
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
FIND OUT IF THERE HAD BEEN

1073
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
HARASSING THINGS GOING ON.

1074
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000

00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I MEAN, OUR STATE DEPARTMENT

1080
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
CAN HELP YOU.
THEY CAN DO THAT.

1081
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
GOVERNMENTS DO DO THAT.
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WLA TO

1082
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
SAY TO YOU.

DEPARTMENT?

>> WE'RE FRUSTRATED.

1086
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
YOU KNOW?

1087
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
WE KNOW THAT BEHIND THE SCENES

1088
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
OUR ATTORNEY IS TALKING TO THE

1089
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
MEXICAN ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND

1090
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
WE KNOW THAT CONGRESS WOMAN

1091

WE'RE VERY FRUSTRATED YES.

1094
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
>> GRETA: THAT IS FINE,

1095
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
THEY'RE TALKING BUT THEY'RE

1096
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
NOT GETTING ANYWHERE.

1097
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
TIME IS UP.

1098
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
YOUR SON HAS BEEN THERE SINCE

1099
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
AUGUST.

1100
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
THERE IS SOME DISCUSSION

1101
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
WHETHER THEY MEASURED THE

1102
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
BARREL WRONG ON THE GUN,

1103
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S ILLEGAL.

1104
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
BUT I -- GOVERNMENTS CAN DO

1105
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
THIS.

1106
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF INFLUENCE

1107
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
