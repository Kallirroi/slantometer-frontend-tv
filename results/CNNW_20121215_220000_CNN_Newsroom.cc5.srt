00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
VIEWERS HERE IN THE UNITED

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
ABOUT THIS DRAMATIC SITUATION

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
OF, THE MASSACRE THAT CLAIMED

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
THE LIVES OF 20 CHILDREN AND 6

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
ADULTS AT THE SANDY HOOK

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
AUTHORITIES HAVE JUST RELEASED

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
THE FULL LIST OF THE VICTIMS'

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
NAMES.
12 GIRLS AND 8 BOYS.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
THEY WERE SHOT AND KILLED.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
ALL WERE EITHER 6 OR 7 YEARS

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
OLD.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
WE'RE TOLD THEY WERE FIRST

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
GRADERS.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
ALL SIX OF THE ADULTS KILLED AT

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
THE SCHOOL WERE WOMEN.

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
JUST MINUTES AGO, A MEDICAL

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
EXAMINER TOLD REPORTERS, ALL OF

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
THE VICTIMS DIED OF GUNSHOTS,

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
AND EVERYBODY WAS HIT MORE THAN

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
ONCE.
THREE GUNS WERE FOUND AT THE

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
SCENE, BUT THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
SAYS ALL OF THE WOUNDS HE KNOWS

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
OF WERE CAUSED BY WHAT HE CALLS

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
THE LONG WEAPON.

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
THAT WOULD BE THE MODIFIED

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE, THAT'S THE

30
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
CIVILIAN VERSION OF THE

31
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
MILITARY'S M-16.

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
CNN'S NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI IS WORKING HER

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
SOURCES.

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
WE'RE HEARING FROM THE GOVERNOR

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
OF CONNECTICUT, DAN MALLOY.

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
UPDATE OUR VIEWERS ON WHAT

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
YOU'RE LEARNING.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
>> WOLF, TODAY WE ARE LEARNING

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
MORE FROM AUTHORITIES ABOUT --

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
THEY ARE PICKING UP MORE

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
EVIDENCE, BOTH AT THE SCENE,

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
CRIME SCENE, AS WELL AS AT THE

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
HOME THAT THE SHOOTER SHARED

45
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
WITH HIS MOTHER.

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
AND THEY ARE TRYING TO -- SAYING

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
IT IS BEGINNING TO EXPLAIN WHY

48
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
THIS HAPPENED.

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
NOW, THEY'RE NOT REVEALING

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
EXACTLY WHAT THAT INFORMATION

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
IS.
HOWEVER, AN OFFICIAL WITH THE

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
ATF IS TELLING US THAT, IN FACT,

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
MORE WEAPONS WERE FOUND AT THE

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
MOTHER'S HOME.

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
NOW, THEY ARE DOING COMPLETE

56
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
TRACES ON THOSE WEAPONS.

57
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
THEY ARE NOT SAYING THEY ARE

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE

59
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
SHOOTING.

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
BUT IT IS PROVIDING MORE OF A

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
PICTURE ABOUT HOW EVERYTHING

62
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
HAPPENED.
WE HAVE, HOWEVER, LEARNED FROM

63
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
OUR SOURCES ABOUT THE THREE

64
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
ADDITIONAL WEAPONS THAT WERE

65
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
FOUND AT THE HOME.

66
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
APPEAR TO BE FOUND THERE.

67
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
AND THEY ARE ALL RIFLES.

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
ALL RIFLES.

69
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THESE ARE IN ADDITION TO THE

70
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
THREE WEAPONS THAT WE'VE ALREADY

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
TOLD YOU ABOUT IN THE LAST

72
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
COUPLE OF DAYS.

73
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
TWO HANDGUNS, A GLOCK AND A SIG

74
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
SAUER.
AS WELL AS THAT SEMIAUTOMATIC

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
KNOWN AS A BUSHMASTER.

76
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
NOW, AUTHORITIES TELL US, OUR

77
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
SOURCES TELL US, THOSE THREE

78
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
WEAPONS WERE, IN FACT, FOUND

79
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
NEXT TO THE SHOOTER'S BODY AT

80
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
THE SCHOOL.

81
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
ONE WAS NOT IN ONE OF THE

82
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
VEHICLES OUTSIDE, BUT ALL THREE

83
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
WERE WITH HIM.

84
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
THEY ALSO DO KNOW WHICH ONE HE

85
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
USED TO KILL HIMSELF, ACCORDING

86
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
TO OUR SOURCES.

87
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
BUT THEY'RE NOT READY TO REVEAL

88
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
THAT YET, BECAUSE THEY CONSIDER

89
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
IT AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE

90
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
INVESTIGATION.

91
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
ALSO AT A NEWS CONFERENCE TODAY,

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER EXPLAINED

93
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
HOW VICIOUS THE ATTACKS WERE.

94
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
THAT THE VICTIMS WERE SHOT AT

95
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
CLOSE RANGE.
WOLF?

96
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
>> SUSAN, I'M GOING INTERRUPT,

97
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR IS SPEAKING

98
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
RIGHT NOW.
DAN MALLOY, THE GOVERNOR OF

99
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
CONNECTICUT.

100
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
>> ALL OF CONNECTICUT'S PEOPLE,

101
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
INDEED, THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD,

102
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
WEEP FOR THE IMMEASURABLE LOSSES

103
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
SUFFERED BY THE FAMILIES AND

104
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
LOVED ONES OF THESE VICTIMS.

105
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
THOUGH WE COULD ALL TRY, WHEN

106
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
SOMETHING AS SENSELESS AS THIS

107
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
OCCURS, THERE'S PRECIOUS LITTLE

108
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
ANYONE CAN SAY TO THE FAMILIES

109
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THAT WILL LESSEN THE HORROR AND

110
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
THE SENSE OF LOSS THEY FEEL.

111
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
WE COULD SAY WE FEEL THEIR PAIN,

112
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
BUT THE TRUTH IS, WE CAN'T.

113
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
WHEN TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS TAKE

114
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
PLACE, PEOPLE OFTEN LOOK FOR

115
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
ANSWERS, AN EXPLANATION OF HOW

116
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED.

117
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
BUT THE SAD TRUTH IS, THERE ARE

118
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
NO ANSWERS.

119
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
NO GOOD ONES, ANYWAY.

120
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
WE HAVE ALL SEEN TRAGEDIES LIKE

121
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
THIS PLAY OUT IN OTHER STATES

122
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

123
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
EACH TIME WE HAVE WONDERED HOW

124
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
SOMETHING SO HORRIFIC COULD

125
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
OCCUR.
AND WE HAVE THANKED GOD THAT IT

126
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
DIDN'T HAPPEN HERE IN OUR

127
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
CONNECTICUT.

128
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
BUT NOW, SADLY IT HAS.

129
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

130
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
AS WAS NO DOUBT THE CASE LAST

131
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
NIGHT, WE CAN HUG SOMEONE WE

132
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
LOVE A LITTLE TIGHTER.

133
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
AS HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE

134
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
YESTERDAY, WE CAN SHOW AND SHARE

135
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
WITH EACH OTHER THE GRIEF WE

136
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
FEEL FOR THE CHILDREN AND ADULTS

137
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
WHO WERE KILLED.

138
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR

139
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
LOVED ONES.

140
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
WE CAN SPEAK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY

141
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
IMPORTANT, AND WHAT CAN WAIT FOR

142
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
ANOTHER DAY.

143
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
THERE WILL BE TIMES SOON FOR A

144
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
DISCUSSION OF PUBLIC POLICY

145
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
ISSUES SURROUNDING YESTERDAY'S

146
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
EVENTS.

147
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW

148
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
IS LOVE, COURAGE AND COMPASSION.

149
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
LOVE, AS IT HAS POURED IN FROM

150
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
AROUND THE WORLD.

151
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
COURAGE AS IT WAS DEMONSTRATEDED

152
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
BY THE TEACHERS AND OTHER ADULTS

153
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
IN THE SCHOOL BUILDING WHOSE

154
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
ACTIONS NO DOUBT SAVED LIVES.

155
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
COURAGE ON DISPLAY AS IT ALWAYS

156
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
IS BY OUR FIRST RESPONDERS.

157
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
COMPASSION AS SHOWN BY PEOPLE

158
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
FROM AROUND CONNECTICUT WHO HAVE

159
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
ARRIVED IN NEWTOWN WANTING ONLY

160
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
TO HELP.
TOO OFTEN, WE FOCUS ON WHAT

161
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
DIVIDES US AS A PEOPLE.

162
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
INSTEAD OF WHAT BINDS US AS

163
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
HUMAN BEINGS.

164
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAY WERE THOSE

165
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
BONDS.
THAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY.

166
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
IN THE COMING DAYS, WE WILL RELY

167
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
ON THAT WHICH WE HAVE BEEN

168
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
TAUGHT AND THAT WHICH WE

169
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
INHERENTLY BELIEVE.

170
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
THAT WE HAVE FAITH FOR A REASON,

171
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
AND THAT FAITH IS GOD'S GIFT TO

172
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
US ALL.

173
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THOSE EDUCATORS AND THOSE

174
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
INNOCENT LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS

175
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR FAMILIES

176
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
FAR TOO SOON.

177
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
LET US ALL HOPE AND PRAY THOSE

178
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
CHILDREN ARE NOW IN A PLACE

179
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
WHERE THAT INNOCENCE WILL

180
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
FOREVER BE PROTECTED.

181
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
MAY GOD BLESS YOU.

182
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
AND MAY GOD BLESS THOSE 27

183
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
PEOPLE.

184
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
MAY GOD BLESS THEIR FAMILIES AND

185
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
FRIENDS.
AND MAY THE PAIN THEIR LOVED

186
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
ONES FEEL BE SOMEDAY ABSORBED BY

187
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
THE LOVE OF ALL MANKIND.

188
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000

INDEED, THE ENTIRE COUNTRY,

192
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
ABOUT THIS HORRENDOUS TRAGEDY

193
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
HERE IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

194
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
TRAGEDY NOW THAT IS BEGINNING --

195
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
THE ENORMITY OF THIS TRAGEDY

196
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
ONLY BEGINNING TO BE FELT WITH

197
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
THE RELEASE OF THE NAMES OF ALL

198
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
OF THE VICTIMS, 23 VICTIMS, 6

199
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
ADULTS, 20 CHILDREN.
THE NAMES HAVE NOW BEEN

200
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
RELEASED.
WE'RE ALSO LEARNING MORE ABOUT

201
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
THE FAMILY OF THE SHOOTER, ADAM

202
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
LANZA.

203
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
CNN'S ALI VELSHI HAS BEEN

204
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
TALKING TO NEIGHBORS, PEOPLE WHO

205
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
KNEW THIS 20-YEAR-OLD.

206
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
HE'S JOINING US NOW.

207
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
ALI, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?

208
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
>> Reporter: WOLF, MORE

209
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
QUESTIONS COME OUT EVERY TIME WE

210
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
TRY AND FIND MORE INFORMATION.

211
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
YOU CAN'T SEE THE HOUSE, IT'S

212
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
BEHIND ME, BEHIND THAT POLICE

213
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
CAR YOU SEE.

214
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
THAT'S CORDONED OFF, STILL A

215
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
CRIME SCENE.
POLICE SAY THEY HAVE FOUND IT

216
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
QUITE FRUITFUL WHAT THEY HAVE

217
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
FOUND IN HERE.

218
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT NANCY LANZA,

219
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
SHE LIVED ALONE WITH ADAM LANZA.

220
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
THE FAMILY LIVED ALONE SINCE

221
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
1998, THE WHOLE FAMILY, NANCY

222
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
LANZA, THE HUSBAND PETER LANZA,

223
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THE SON RYAN, 24 YEARS OLD, AND

224
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
ADAM, WHO WAS 20 YEARS OLD.

225
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
WHAT HAPPENED IS PETER LANZA

226
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
LEFT THE HOUSE AT SOME POINT A

227
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THEY

228
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
DIVORCED.
HE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

229
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
RYAN LANZA, WHO IS 24 YEARS OLD,

230
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
WENT OFF TO WORK.

231
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
HE LIVED IN HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY.

232
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
WE SAW HE WAS TAKEN IN FOR

233
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
QUESTIONING YESTERDAY.

234
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
THAT LEFT ADAM AND NANCY BACK

235
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
HERE.

236
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
NANCY LANZA WORKED IN FINANCE IN

237
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
BOSTON AND HERE IN CONNECTICUT

238
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
FOR SOME YEARS.
BUT RECENTLY SHE HAS LEFT WORK.

239
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS

240
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
RETIRING OR WHETHER SHE WAS

241
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
TAKING A BREAK.

242
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
SHE DID TELL ACQUAINTANCES SHE

243
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
WANTED TO TAKE CARE OF ADAM.

244
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
NOW, WE DID SPEAK TO ONE

245
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
NEIGHBOR, GENE J McDADE, WHO

246
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
SAID SHE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING

247
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
UNUSUAL ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR

248
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
FAMILY.

249
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
>> SHE WAS A STAY-AT-HOME MOM

250
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
WHO LOVED HER KIDS.

251
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
THERE IS NO EXPLANATION.

252
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
THERE WAS NO FUNNY BUSINESS

253
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
GOING ON AS FAR AS I KNOW.

254
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
>> THEY WERE QUIET.

255
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
SEEMINGLY FRIENDLY PEOPLE.

256
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE IN THIS

257
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
NEIGHBORHOOD REALLY KNEW THEM
TOO WELL.

258
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
>> WERE THEY -- DID THEY

259
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
STRUGGLE, WERE THEY MORE SIMPLE?

260
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
>> I THINK THEY WERE WELL OFF,

261
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
BUT I CAN ONLY SPECULATE.

262
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I DON'T KNOW.

263
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
IT'S NOT REALLY MY BUSINESS.

264
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
>> THAT WAS GINA McDADE'S SON,

265
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
JP.
I'LL TELL YOU, THE ONE QUESTION

266
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
THAT KEEPS COMING UP HERE, THIS

267
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
IS AN UPSCALE, AFLUENT FAMILY.

268
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
WHAT'S THE CONNECTION TO THE

269
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
GUNS?
SOME POLICE SOURCES ARE SAYING

270
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
ADAM MAY HAVE HAD ACCESS TO SIX

271
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
GUNS, TWO OF WHICH WERE USED IN

272
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THE SHOOTINGS.

273
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
ONE WHICH WAS A SEMIAUTOMATIC

274
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
RIFLE, A BUSHMASTER, WHICH WAS

275
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
FOUND IN THE CAR.

276
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
AND THREE OTHER STANDARD RIFLES,

277
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
ONE OF THEM WAS AN M-FIELD.

278
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
WE DID SPEAK TO A LANDSCAPER IN

279
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
THE AREA WHO HAD ACTUALLY BEEN

280
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
INVOLVED IN PUTH UP CHRISTMAS

281
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
DECORATIONS, A LOT OF CHRISTMAS

282
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
DECORATIONS AROUND HERE VERY

283
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
RECENTLY FOR NANCY LANZA.

284
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
HE TOLD US THAT NANCY LANZA HAD

285
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
SHOWN HIM A RIFLE THAT SHE HAD

286
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
PURCHASED RECENTLY, THAT SHE WAS

287
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
A GUN ENTHUSIAST, AND SHE LIKED

288
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
TAKING HER KIDS TO TARGET

289
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
PRACTICE.

290
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS

291
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
AND WHERE THAT TARGET PRACTICE

292
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
WAS.

293
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
WE ALSO HAVE WORD FROM THE ATF

294
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
THAT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

295
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
TRUE.
SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET TO

296
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
THE BOTTOM OF WHAT ROLE GUNS HAD

297
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
IN THIS FAMILY.

298
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
BUT FOR THE MOMENT, A LOT OF

299
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
THESE NEIGHBORS SAY THEY DIDN'T

300
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
REALLY KNOW THEM ALL THAT WELL,

301
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
EVEN THOUGH THEY LIVED IN THE

302
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
HOUSE SINCE 1998, WOLF.

303
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
>> SINCE 1998.

304
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
THEY HAVE LIVED THERE.

305
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
AND THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY VERY

306
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
QUIET, THESE FOLKS.

307
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
PEOPLE DIDN'T -- THEY WEREN'T

308
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
VERY SOCIABLE IS THAT THE

309
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
IMPRESSION YOU'RE GETTING?

310
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
>> Reporter: YEAH.

311
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
YOU KNOW, INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT

312
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
WAS THEY WEREN'T SOCIABLE.

313
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
IT JUST WAS THEY WEREN'T VERY

314
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
WELL-KNOWN AROUND THIS AREA.

315
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
IT'S A QUIET AREA, NO STREET

316
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
LIGHTS.

317
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
THE ONLY LIGHTS YOU SEE ARE FROM

318
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
OUR CAMERAS.

319
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
A QUIET AREA.

320
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
BOTH SONS ARE SAID TO HAVE

321
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
ENJOYED SKATEBOARDING.

322
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
BUT WE'RE NOT RUNNING INTO

323
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
PEOPLE WHO KNEW THEM.

324
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING.

325
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
THESE NEIGHBORS ARE BEING VERY

326
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
QUIET.
MANY WERE EVACUATED OR TAKEN OUT

327
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
WHILE THE CRIME SCENE WAS BEING

328
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
COMBED.
AND MANY ARE IN THEIR HOMES BUT

329
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
THEIR LIGHTS ARE OFF.

330
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
WE SEE THEM LOOKING OUT.

331
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
WE DON'T WANT TO BE DISTURBING

332
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO TALK TO

333
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
US.
WE'RE NOT GETTING AS MUCH --

334
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
MAYBE THEY KNEW MORE PEOPLE,

335
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
MAYBE THEIR SOCIAL CIRCLE WAS

336
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
OUTSIDE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

337
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
IT IS JUST UNUSUAL THAT IN A

338
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
PLACE LIKE THIS, AFTER HAVING

339
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
LIVED HERE FOR SO LONG, WE DON'T

340
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING

341
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
FORWARD AND SAYING WE REALLY

342
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
KNEW THEM, HERE'S WHAT THEY WERE

343
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
LIKE.
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A FULL

344
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
PICTURE YET.

345
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
>> IT IS UNFOLDING, IT IS

346
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
DEVELOPING.

347
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
THE KEY THING HERE IS WE KNOW

348
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
THAT NANCY STOPPED WORKING

349
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
RECENTLY.

350
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHY.

351
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE

352
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
BOTTOM OF THAT, WOLF.

353
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
>> ALI VELSHI, THANKS VERY MUCH.

354
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
WE'LL STAY IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH

355
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
YOU.
THERE IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE A

356
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
LOT OF ATTENTION ON THE

357
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE, LIKE THE

358
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
ONE THAT THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

359
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
JUST SAID WAS USED TO SHOOT

360
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
EVERY ONE OF THE VICTIMS.

361
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
OUR CRIME AND JUSTICE

362
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
CORRESPONDENT JOE JOHNS HAS MORE

363
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
ON THE GUNS USED IN THE

364
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
SHOOTING.
JOE, TELL US WHAT YOU'RE

365
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
LEARNING.
>> WOLF, THE BUSHMASTER .223 IS

366
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
A WELL-KNOWN SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE

367
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
USED BY THE BELTWAY SNIPERS MORE

368
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
THAN A DECADE AGO TO WREAK HAVOC

369
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
HERE AROUND THE WASHINGTON, D.C.

370
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
AREA.

371
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
IT LOOKS LIKE A MILITARY WEAPON,

372
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
CERTAINLY FORMIDABLE, BUT IT HAS

373
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
ELEMENTS THAT CLEARLY MAKE IT A

374
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
HUNTING WEAPON.
AND NOW THE MEDICAL EXAMINER IN

375
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
CONNECTICUT SAYS ALL THE WOUNDS

376
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
HE KNOWS OF CAME FROM, QUOTE,

377
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
THE LONG GUN, WHICH ACCORDING TO

378
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
OUR UNDERSTANDING, IS THE

379
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
BUSHMASTER.
WHICH WAS CONFISCATED FROM THE

380
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
SHOOTING SCENE AND APPARENTLY

381
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
CAUSED ALL THE INJURIES TO THE

382
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
VICTIMS, THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

383
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
SAW.

384
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE'RE

385
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
ASKING RIGHT NOW IS WHETHER THAT

386
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
BUSHMASTER .223 FOUND ON THE

387
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
SCENE WOULD HAVE BEEN BANNED,

388
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
EITHER UNDER THE OLD FEDERAL

389
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN THAT PASSED

390
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
DURING THE CLINTON

391
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
ADMINISTRATION AND EXPIRED

392
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
DURING THE GEORGE W. BUSH YEARS.

393
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
WE ASKED A FORMER TOP OFFICIAL

394
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF

395
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND FIREARMS

396
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
ABOUT THAT.

397
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
AND HE SAID IT JUST DEPENDS ON

398
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
HOW THE GUN WAS OUTFITTED, AND

399
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
SOME OF THESE THINGS WE DON'T

400
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
KNOW YET.

401
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000

402
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
>> UNDER THE ASSAULT WEAPON BAN,

403
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
A WEAPON LIKE THE BUSHMASTER

404
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
WOULD ONLY HAVE BEEN BANNED IF

405
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
IT HAD THINGS LIKE A FOLDING

406
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
STOCK, EXTENDED MAGAZINE, MORE

407
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
THAN TEN ROUNDS, I BELIEVE.

408

OR -- OTHER THAN FIXED SIGHTS,

409
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
THOSE KIND OF THINGS.
THOSE WOULD HAVE CAUSED IT TO

410
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
HAVE BEEN BANNED BEFORE.

411
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
>> OKAY.
SO HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE OLD

412
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
FEDERAL BAN.

413
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
NOW, BRESHARD SAYS THE STATE OF

414
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
CONNECTICUT HAS ITS OWN ASSAULT

415
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
WEAPONS BAN, BUT THIS BUSHMASTER

416
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
FOUND AT THE SCENE MIGHT NOT

417
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THAT

418
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
EITHER.
THE BUSHMASTER RIFLE CERTAINLY

419
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
CAN BE CONSTRUED AS A SPORTING

420
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
RIFLE TO SHOOT SMALL ANIMALS.

421
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
THE WEAPON ADAM LANZA WAS USING

422
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
MIGHT HAVE BEEN LEGIT UNDER PAST

423
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
AND PRESENT LAW.

424
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000

>> AND THE WEAPONS THAT WERE

426
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
FOUND THAT THEY BELIEVE WERE ALL

427
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
PURCHASED LEGALLY, RIGHT?

428
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
>> RIGHT.

429
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
LEGALLY BY NANCY LANZA.

430
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
THE MOTHER OF ADAM LANZA.

431
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
SHE, OF COURSE, WAS FOUND DEAD.

432
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
SO IT DOES APPEAR THAT THOSE

433
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
WERE PURCHASED LEGALLY BY THE

434
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
MOTHER, ADAM LANZA APPARENTLY

435
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO YOUNG.

436
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
WE ALSO DO HAVE THAT REPORT THAT

437
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
ADAM LANZA TRIED TO PURCHASE A

BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING ON,

443

JOE.

444
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE BIG

445
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
PICTURE, THE GUN DEBATE

446
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
CERTAINLY WILL BE INTENSIFIED AS

447
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
A RESULT OF WHAT'S GOING ON.

448
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
BUT CONNECTICUT HAS AMONG THE

449
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE

450
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
COUNTRY, RIGHT?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

451
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
CONNECTICUT HAS A VERY STRICT

452
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
GUN LAW THERE.

453
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON

454
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
WHY AUTHORITIES WERE ABLE TO GO

455
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
BACK AND TRACE SO QUICKLY TO

456
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
FIND OUT THAT AT LEAST THE THREE

457
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
WEAPONS WE KNEW ABOUT AS OF

458
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
YESTERDAY HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY

459
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
THE MOTHER.

460
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
THAT WOULD BE THE SIG SAUER AS

461
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
WELL AS THE GLOCK, ALONG WITH

462
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
THIS BUSHMASTER.

463
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
SO THEY WERE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT

464
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
PRETTY QUICKLY, DUE TO

465
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
CONNECTICUT LAW, WHO HAD

466
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
PURCHASED THESE WEAPONS.

467
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
NONETHELESS, THIS STILL
HAPPENED.

468
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
OF COURSE, THAT'S ALL PART OF

469
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
THE WEAPONS DEBATE, AS YOU KNOW,

470
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000

INTENSIFY.
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

554
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
AND FOR NO REASON.

555
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
AND WE CAN ONLY PRAY WE FIND

556
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
UNDERSTANDING IN THE DAYS AND

557
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
WEEKS TO COME.

558
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
AND ONE DAY FIND PEACE.

559
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
BUT WE WERE ALL BLESSED TO HAVE

560
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
KNOWN HER.

561
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
AND TO HAVE HAD HER IN OUR

562
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
LIVES.

563
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
THERE'S BEEN A FUND THAT WAS SET

564
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
UP BY MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILIES

565
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
AND FRIENDS BACK IN UTAH THAT

566
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DONATING TO,

567
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
AND WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL

568
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
OF YOU FOR YOUR DONATIONS TO

569
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
THAT.
WE'RE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO USE

570
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
THAT TO BRING EMILIE BACK TO

571
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
UTAH FOR HER FINAL RESTING PLACE

572
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
WITH HER FAMILY THERE.

573
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
AND WE WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU

574
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
WHO MADE THOSE DONATIONS.

575
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I WILL TURN THIS TO ROB PARKER.

576
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
>> WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR FROM

577
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
THE FATHER NOW OF THIS

578
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
6-YEAR-OLD, EMILIE PARKER, SHOT

579
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
AND KILLED IN THE ELEMENTARY

580
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
SCHOOL YESTERDAY.
THAT WAS -- THAT WAS EMILIE

581
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
PARKER'S AUNT WHO WAS SPEAKING,

582
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
AND HER FATHER, EMILIE PARKER'S

583
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
FATHER, ROBBY PARKER IS GOING TO

584
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
BE SPEAKING RIGHT NOW.
THE FAMILY WANTED TO SPEAK AND

585
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
WANTED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THEY

586
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
WANTED TO REMEMBER LITTLE EMILIE

587
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
PARKER, AND WE JUST HEARD WHAT A

588
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
WONDERFUL YOUNG LITTLE

589
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL SHE WAS.

590
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
HOW SAD OF A STORY THIS IS.

591
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
IT GETS SADDER AND SADDER AS WE

592
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
LEARN MORE DETAILS OF THESE

593
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
YOUNG KIDS AND THE SIX ADULTS

594
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
SHOT AND KILLED AT THAT SCHOOL.

595
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
26 VICTIMS, 20 CHILDREN.

596
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
6 AND 7-YEAR-OLD FIRST GRADERS

597
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
MOSTLY SHOT FOR NO REASON AT

598
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
ALL.

599
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
AND SIX ADULTS, MOSTLY TEACHERS,

600
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
ALL WOMEN, SHOT AND KILLED, AS

601
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
WELL.
ONCE AGAIN, ROBBY PARKER, THE

602
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
FATHER OF 6-YEAR-OLD EMILIE

603
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
PARKER, IS SUPPOSED TO COME TO

604
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
THE MICROPHONES.

605
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I ASSUME HE'S CONSOLING THE

606
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
SISTER RIGHT NOW.

607
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
AND HE WILL HAVE THE STRENGTH --

608
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
THIS IS THE DECISION THAT THE

609
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
PARKER FAMILY WANTED TO DO.

610
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
THEY WANTED TO COME TO THE

611
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
MICROPHONES.

612
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
THEY WANTED TO SPEAK ABOUT

613
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
EMILIE PARKER.

614
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

615
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
HAVE SEEN NOW THAT -- PRESUMABLY

616
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
WE'LL SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE,

617
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
PEOPLE WANTING TO REMEMBER THEIR

618
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
LOVED ONES AND SPEAKING OUT.

619
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL IN A SITUATION

620
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
LIKE THIS.

621
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I REMEMBER AT VIRGINIA TECH WHEN

622
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I WENT OUT THERE, PARENTS, LOVED

623
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
ONES OF SLAIN YOUNG PEOPLE

624
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
WANTED TO REMEMBER THEIR SONS

625
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
AND THEIR DAUGHTERS, AND AS A

626
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
RESULT THEY SPOKE AND MADE A

627
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
STATEMENT.

628
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
SO WE'LL SEE IF ROBBY PARKER --

629
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I ASSUME HE'S GOING TO COME OUT

630
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
TO THE MICROPHONES NOW.

631
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
AND MAKE A STATEMENT.

632
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
IT LOOKS LIKE THE FAMILY IS

633
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
THERE.
AND THEY'RE GETTING READY TO

634
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
MAKE -- TO COME TO THE MIKE

635
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
REPHONE.
WE'LL LISTEN IN.

636
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
>> OKAY.

637
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
SO MY NAME IS ROBBY PARKER.

638
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
MY FAMILY IS ONE OF THE FAMILIES

639
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
THAT LOST A CHILD YESTERDAY.

640
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
IN THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

641
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS HERE IN

642
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
CONNECTICUT.

643
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY SO MANY

644
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
PEOPLE AND AGENCIES WANTING TO

645
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
KNOW HOW WE'RE DOING AND I JUST

646
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT BE THE

647
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
BEST WAY TO SHARE THOSE FEELINGS

648
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
WITH EVERYBODY.

649
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD REALLY

650
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
LIKE TO OFFER OUR DEEPEST

651
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
CONDOLENCES TO ALL OF THE

652
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
FAMILIES WHO WERE DIRECTLY

653
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
AFFECTED BY THIS SHOOTING.

654
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
IT'S AN HORRIFIC TRAGEDY, AND WE

655
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT OUR

656
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO OUT TO

657
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
THEM.

658
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
THIS INCLUDES THE FAMILY OF THE

659
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
SHOOTER.

660
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD THIS

661
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
EXPERIENCE MUST BE FOR YOU.

662
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR

663
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
FAMILY AND OUR LOVE AND OUR

664
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
SUPPORT GOES OUT TO YOU AS WELL.

665
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
AT THIS TIME, OUR THANKS GO OUT

666
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
TO SO MANY PEOPLE, SO MANY

667
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

668
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
AND COMPLETE STRANGERS WHO WE

669
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
DON'T KNOW.
FOR ALL THE LOVE, CONDOLENCES

670
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
AND IS SUPPORT YOU'VE GIVEN TO

671
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
US.

672
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
MY DAUGHTER EMILIE WOULD BE ONE

673
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE STANDING

674
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
AND GIVING HER LOVE AND SUPPORT

675
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS.

676
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF

677
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
PERSON THAT SHE IS.

678
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
NOT BECAUSE OF ANY PARENTING

679
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
THAT MY WIFE AND I COULD HAVE

680
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
DONE.

681
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
BUT BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE GIFTS

682
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY HER

683
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
HEAVENLY FATHER.

684
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

685
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

686
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

687
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

688
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
WAS, AND HOW MANY LIVES SHE WAS

689
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT TIME

690
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
HERE ON EARTH.

691
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

692
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
VERY LOVING.

693
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
EMILIE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO TRY

694
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
NEW THINGS, OTHER THAN FOOD.

695
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
SHE LOVED TO USE HER TALENTS TO

696
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
IT TOUCH THE LIVES OF EVERYONE

697
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
SHE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH.

698
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
SHE WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL ARTIST,

699
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
AND SHE ALWAYS CARRIED AROUND

700
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
HER MARKERS AND PENCILS SO SHE

701
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
NEVER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO

702
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
DRAW A PICTURE OR MAKE A CARD

703
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
FOR THOSE AROUND HER.

704
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF

705
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
TIMES EMILIE NOTICED SOMEONE

706
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
FEELING SAD OR FRUSTRATED AND

707
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
WOULD RUSH TO FIND A PIECE OF

708
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
PAPER TO DRAW THEM A PICTURE OR

709
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
TO WRITE THEM AN ENCOURAGING

710
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
NOTE.

711
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
EMILIE'S CARD-MAKING WAS

712
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
EXPRESSED BEAUTIFULLY THIS LAST

713
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
OCTOBER WHEN SHE PLACED A VERY

714
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
SPECIAL CARD SHE HAD MADE INTO

715
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
THE CASKET WITH HER GRANDPA, WHO

716
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
ALSO JUST RECENTLY DIED OF A

717
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
TRAGIC ACCIDENT.

718
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER TWO

719
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
LITTLE SISTERS IN DELIGHTING AND

720
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ, DANCE

721
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS IN

722
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
LIFE.

723
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
EMLIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS,

724
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
AND ALL WOULD AGREE THIS WORLD

725
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
WAS A BETTER PLACE BECAUSE SHE

726
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
HAS BEEN IN IT.

727
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT HAPPENED

728
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO SO MANY

729
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN INTO

730
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US.

731
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
BUT SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US

732
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
TO BE BETTER, TO BE MORE

733
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
COMPASSIONATE, AND MORE HUMBLE

734
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
PEOPLE.

735
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
LET US PLEASE KEEP THE

736
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
SENTIMENTS OF LOVE WE FEEL FOR

737
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
OUR FAMILIES AND THE COMPASSION

1105
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1106
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
IT IS JUST SO -- IT IS JUST --

1107
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
IT'S SO UNHUMAN TO THINK THAT

1108
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
YOU OUTLIVE YOUR CHILDREN.

1109
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW, YOU

1110
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
KNOW -- WHEN YOU HEAR HIM TALK

1111
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
LIKE THAT, HE WANTS TO EMPOWER

1112
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
HIMSELF.
HE WANTS TO TURN THIS INTO SOME

1113
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
SORT OF -- YOU KNOW, HE WANTS TO

1114
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
TURN IT INTO SOMETHING WHERE HE

1115
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
CAN HELP OTHER PEOPLE.

1116
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
AND THAT'S HOW HE'S GOING TO

1117
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
HELP GET HIMSELF THROUGH THIS.

1118
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000

1179
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
GOT TO THE SCHOOL AND REALIZED

1180
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
IT WAS SANDY HOOK, I PULLED DOWN

1181
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
DICKENSON DRIVE AS FAR AS I
COULD.

1182
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I COULDN'T GET ALL THE WAY.

1183
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I DROVE OVER THE CURB AND INTO

1184
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
THE FIREHOUSE PARKING LOT AND I

1185
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
SAID, "IT'S HERE, IT'S HERE.

1186
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
THERE'S BEEN A SHOOTING HERE."

1187
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
AND I SAW THE EMTs WORKING ON A

1188
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
LITTLE BOY AND I KNEW IT WASN'T

1189
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
OUR SON, BECAUSE I KNEW FROM THE

1190
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
CLOTHES.
SO I RAN TO THE SCHOOL AND, YOU

1191
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
KNOW THE CHAOS IS INDESCRIBABLE.

1192
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE LIVING THROUGH

1193
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
COLUMBINE.
EVERYTHING YOU'VE SEEN ON TV.

1194
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
SO AS THE CHILDREN START TO COME

1195
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
OUT, YOU KNOW, SINGLE-FILE,

1196
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
CLASS BY CLASS, GROUP BY GROUP,

1197
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
WHEN YOU SEE THEIR TEACHER -- I

1198
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
SAW MY DAUGHTER'S TEACHER, AND

1199
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
SHE WASN'T -- MY DAUGHTER WASN'T

1200
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
WITH HER TEACHER.

1201
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
AND I GRABBED HER TEACHER AND I

1202
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
ASKED HER WHERE SHE WAS AND SHE

1203
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW, BECAUSE

1204
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
SHE WASN'T WITH THE CLASS.

1205
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
SO THE KIDS START TO COME OUT

1206
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
AND WHEN I SAW HER, YOU KNOW,

1207
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
THE SENSE OF RELIEF IS

1208
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
INCREDIBLE, BUT IT'S REALLY

1209
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
SHORT-LIVED BECAUSE I STILL HAVE
ONE IN THERE.

1210
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
AND I'M WAITING FOR HIM TO COME.

1211
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
AND HE DIDN'T COME OUT.

1212
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
AND I DIDN'T SEE HIS TEACHER AND

1213
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I DIDN'T SEE HIS CLASSMATES.

1214
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
AND SO AS A PARENT, YOU KNOW, I

1215
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
HUGGED MY DAUGHTER AND I SAID,

1216
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
YOU KNOW -- I TOLD HER TO HUG

1217
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
HER FRIEND WHO WAS IN HER CLASS

1218
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
AND I SAID GO TO THE FIRE

1219
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
STATION, DADDY IS COMING.

1220
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
AND I'M GOING TO WAIT FOR AIDEN.

1221
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I'M GOING TO WAIT.

1222
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
AND HE DIDN'T COME OUT.

1223
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
SO YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE

1224
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
STANDING THERE WAITING, AND NO

1225
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
ONE WILL TELL YOU ANYTHING, IT'S

1226
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
INDESCRIBABLE FEELING OF

1227
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
HELPLESSNESS.

1228
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
YOU KNOW, WE ARE VERY LUCKY,

1229
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
BECAUSE I THINK I WAS THERE AN

1230
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
HOUR, AND THEN THE GROUP STOPPED

1231
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
COMING.

1232
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
AND I JUST KNEW NO ONE ELSE WAS

1233
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
COMING OUT OF THAT SCHOOL.

1234
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I JUST KNEW IN MY HEART.

1235
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
AND I ACTUALLY RECEIVED A TEXT

1236
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
FROM A FRIEND THAT SAID THAT HE

1237
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
WAS AT THE POLICE STATION AND HE

1238
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
WAS SAFE THERE AND ONE OF THE

1239
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
GROUPS OF KIDS THAT RAN AND GOT

1240
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
OUT.

1241
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
AND HAD BEEN PICKED UP.

1242
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
AND SO WHEN WE WENT THERE AND I

1243
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
SAW HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT

1244
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
WAS JUST AN INCREDIBLE FEELING

1245
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
OF RELIEF.

1246
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
AND I FEEL SO BLESSED.

1247
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
IT'S JUST A FEELING OF BLESSING.

1248
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
>> A MIRACLE.

1249
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
>> IT TRULY IS.

1250
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
>> THE CHILDREN WHO GOT OUT OF

1251
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
THAT CLASSROOM, IT WAS A
BLESSING.

1252
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
INDESCRIBABLE.
>> IT'S AN AMAZING FEELING.

1253
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
AND YOU FEEL SO RELIEVED.

1254
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW

1255
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
THAT OTHERS CAN'T SHARE THAT

1256
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
FEELING.

1257
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
AND YOU JUST -- YOUR HEART

1258
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
DOESN'T KNOW WHICH DIRECTION TO

1259
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
GO.
THEIR FRIENDS, THEIR NEIGHBORS.

1260
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
>> IT WAS ALL SO -- THE

1261
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
MAGNITUDE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED,

1262
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
NOT JUST FOR US, BUT FOR

1263
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
EVERYONE IN THIS COMMUNITY

1264
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
HASN'T EVEN BEEN FELT YET.

1265
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
BECAUSE THE CHILDREN EVENTUALLY

1266
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
WILL LEARN ABOUT THEIR FRIENDS

1267
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
AND THEIR TEACHER AND OTHERS

1268
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
THAT THEY KNOW.

1269
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
AND, YOU KNOW, WE -- WE PARENTS

1270
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
NEED TO DO THE BEST TO PREPARE

1271
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
OUR CHILDREN FOR THAT AND

1272
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
EXPLAIN IN THE BEST WAY WE CAN

1273
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
THAT MAKES SENSE TO THEM WHAT'S

1274
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
HAPPENED AND HOW TO KIND OF HELP

1275
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
THEM THROUGH THAT PROCESS.

1276
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
>> FROM WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TOLD BY

1277
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
YOUR SON AND WHAT YOU KNOW NOW,

1278
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
WHAT HAPPENED?

1279
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
>> ACCORDING TO AIDEN, THEY WENT

1280
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
THROUGH THEIR NORMAL DAY.

1281
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
THEY DID THEIR CIRCLE TIME,

1282
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
THEIR -- WHERE THEY INTRODUCE

1283
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
EACH OTHER.

1284
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
THEY DID THEIR MESSAGE.

1285
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
>> OVER THE LOUD SPEAKER.

1286
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
>> AND THEY WERE DOING THEIR

1287
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE LOUD

1288
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
SPEAKER.
AND THAT'S WHEN THEY HEARD

1289
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
NOISES THAT HE DESCRIBED AS --

1290
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
INITIALLY THEY THOUGHT WERE

1291
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
HAMMERS FALLING.
THEN THEY REALIZED THAT IT WAS

1292
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
GUNSHOTS.

1293
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
AND MS. SOTO, WHO IS AIDEN'S

1294
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
TEACHER, HAD THE PRESENCE OF

1295
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
MIND TO MOVE ALL OF THE CHILDREN

1296
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
TO A DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE DOOR

1297
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROOM FURTHEST

1298
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
AWAY FROM THE DOOR.

1299
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
AND THAT'S WHEN THE GUNMAN BURST

1300
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
IN, DID NOT SAY A WORD.

1301
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
NO FACIAL EXPRESSIONS.

1302
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
AND PROCEEDED TO SHOOT THEIR

1303
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
TEACHER.

1304
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
AT THAT TIME, THE CHILDREN FROM

1305
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
AN EARLY AGE ARE TAUGHT, WHEN

1306
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
THEY SEE A PERSON WITH A GUN,

1307
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
YOU RUN AND YOU CALL 911.

1308
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
AND THAT'S -- THEY PRACTICE IT

1309
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
IN SCHOOL WITH THEIR FIRE

1310
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
EMERGENCY DRILLS AND EVERYTHING.

1311
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
AND WE'RE VERY LUCKY THAT ALL

1312
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
THE CHILDREN -- MY SON INCLUDED,

1313
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO

1314
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
REACT PRESENCE OF MIND TO

1315
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
REACT APPROPRIATELY.

1316
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
AND THEY BASICALLY RAN RIGHT

1317
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
NEXT TO THE GUY OUT THE DOOR.

1318
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
>> THEY RAN PAST THE MAN?

1319
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
>> WELL, WE'RE CLEARLY HAVING

1320
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.

1321
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
AND WE'LL BRING MORE OF MY

1322
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
INTERVIEW WITH ROBERT AND DIANE,

1323
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
BUT YOU CAN JUST SEE KIND OF THE

1324
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
PROCESS THAT THESE FAMILIES WENT

1325
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
THROUGH, AS THEY LEARNED OF

1326
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
THIS -- SOMETHING WAS WRONG AT

1327
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
THIS SCHOOL.

1328
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
AND THEN AS THEY RUN TO FIND

1329
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
THEIR CHILDREN, AND IT WAS

1330
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
REALLY DIFFICULT TO HEAR THEM

1331
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
RE-PLAY IT.

1332
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
AND THE PART RIGHT THERE, WOLF,

1333
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT

1334
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
TO TELL OUR VIEWERS, AS THEIR

1335
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
SON SAW THIS SHOOTER SHOOT HIS

1336
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
TEACHER, HE SOMEHOW HAD THE

1337
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
PRESENCE OF MIND, WELL, FOR HE

1338
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
AND SEVERAL OF HIS CLASSMATES, A

1339
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY TO RUN PAST THE

1340
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
SHOOTER AND RUN OUT OF THE

1341
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
SCHOOL.
AND EVENTUALLY RUN TO SAFETY.

1342
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
IT TRULY IS A MIRACLE, THEY SAY,

1343
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
THEY SAY ANGELS WERE IN THAT

1344
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
CLASSROOM TO GET THEIR SON OUT

1345
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
YESTERDAY MORNING.

1346
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
BUT THEY KNOW THATO MANY

1347
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
FAMILIES ARE NOT AS LUCKY AS

1348
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
THEY WERE.

1349
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
AND THEY SHARE IN THAT GRIEF.

1350
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
AND THAT IS WHY THEY REALLY

1351
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
WANTED TO SIT DOWN WITH ME THIS

1352
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
MORNING.

1353
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO NOT ONLY

1354
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
TALK ABOUT HOW BLESSED THEY ARE,

1355
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
BUT TO ALSO SEND THEIR

1356
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
CONDOLENCES, AND SHARE THAT

1357
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
THERE IS A LOT OF HEALING AND

1358
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
GRIEVING THAT STILL NEEDS TO GO

1359
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
ON IN THIS TOWN.

1360
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
>> THEY WANTED TO SHARE THEIR

1361
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
STORY, THEY WANTED TO SHARE WHAT

1362
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
WAS GOING ON WITH ALL OF US, AND

1363
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,000
LET US KNOW WHAT EXACTLY

1364
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
HAPPENED.
BECAUSE IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO

1365
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
THEM.
IT WAS NOT A SITUATION WHERE YOU

1366
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
HAD TO COAX THEM OR CONVINCE

1367
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
THEM OR TALK THEM INTO THIS.

1368
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
THIS WAS THEIR IDEA.

1369
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
>> Reporter: THEY'RE A GREAT

1370
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
FAMILY, AND THEY'RE VERY

1371
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
PROTECTIVE OF THEIR CHILDREN.

1372
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
AND THEY DID NOT WANT THEIR

1373
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
CHILDREN INTERVIEWED.

1374
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
AND OF COURSE, WE RESPECTED

1375
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
THAT.
I DID HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET

1376
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
THEIR CHILDREN AND KIND OF

1377
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
ACTUALLY PLAY A LITTLE BIT WITH

1378
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
AIDEN THIS MORNING.

1379
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
HE IS A REMARKABLE YOUNG BOY.

1380
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
AND THESE ARE TWO VERY STRONG

1381
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
PARENTS, THEY ACKNOWLEDGE TO ME

1382
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
THEY HAVE A VERY ROUGH ROAD

1383
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
AHEAD, EVEN FOR THEIR FAMILY, TO

1384
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
FIGURE OUT HOW THEY, AS PARENTS,

1385
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
AND AS HUMAN BEINGS WILL LEARN

1386
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS TRAGEDY.

1387
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
BECAUSE THEY -- THEY SAY THEY

1388
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW, NO ONE IS

1389
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
PREPARED FOR THIS TYPE OF THING,

1390
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
WOLF, THAT IS THE UNDERSTATEMENT

1391
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
OF THE YEAR, WOLF.

1392
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE OF

1393
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
YOUR INTERVIEW, KATE, COMING UP

1394
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
LATER IN OUR SPECIAL SATURDAY

1395
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
SITUATION ROOM.

1396
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
MEANWHILE, OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE

1397
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
WILL RESUME RIGHT AFTER THIS.

1398
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
>>> WE'RE HERE IN NEWTOWN,

1399
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
CONNECTICUT.

1400
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
WE'RE GETTING MORE REACTION, THE

1401
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
INCREDIBLE FALLOUT FROM THIS

1402
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE TRAGEDY THAT

1403
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
OCCURRED HERE YESTERDAY IN THE

1404
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 26 PEOPLE

1405
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
WERE SHOT.
SIX OF THEM ADULTS.

1406
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
20 CHILDREN, AND WE NOW HAVE THE

1407
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
NAMES OF EVERYONE WHO WAS

1408
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
KILLED.
SANJAY GUPTA IS WATCHING AND

1409
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
LISTENING AND WONDERING WHAT IS

1410
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
GOING ON, LIKE ALL OF US,

1411
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
SANJAY, AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR,

1412
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
NEAR THE TOP OF THE HOUR WE'RE

1413
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
GOING TO BE HEARING FROM THE

1414
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
BROTHER OF NANCY LANZA, SHE IS

1415
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
THE MOTHER OF TWENTY-YEAR-OLD

1416
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
ADAM LANZA.

1417
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
THE BROTHER WANTS TO SPEAK OUT,

1418
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR WHAT HE HAS

1419
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
TO SAY.
ANOTHER POWERFUL PERSPECTIVE

1420
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
FROM A PERSON FROM THE LANZA

1421
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
FAMILY.
>> OBVIOUSLY, YES, WE HAVEN'T

1422
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
HEARD FROM THEM AT ALL.

1423
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
AND PEOPLE KEEP ASKING THIS

1424
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
QUESTION, WHY.

1425
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT HE CAN

1426
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
PROVIDE AN ANSWER.

1427
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
AND AS YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT

1428
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
EARLIER, I'M NOT SURE IT IS EVEN

1429
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
KNOWABLE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CURIOUS TO

1430
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
HEAR FROM HIM, AS WELL, AND TRY

1431
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE IS

1432
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
ANYMORE SORT OF SENSE OF ALL OF

1433
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
THIS.

1434
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
>> AND YOU'RE A NEUROSURGEON,

1435
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
YOU STUDY THE BRAIN.

1436
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN MAKE

1437
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
ANY SENSE OF WHAT TRIGGERS

1438
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
SOMEBODY TO GO INTO A SCHOOL

1439
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
LIKE THAT AND JUST START KILLING

1440
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
YOUNG KIDS.

1441
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
>> I CAN'T, YOU KNOW, AND I

1442
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
THINK YOU KNOW THAT THERE WILL

1443
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
BE A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT

1444
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
THIS, I THINK, IN TERMS OF

1445
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
LOOKING AT POSSIBLE CAUSES, EVEN

1446
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
MEDICAL CAUSES.

1447
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
WHETHER IT BE MENTAL ILLNESS OR

1448
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
SOMETHING, BUT IT IS JUST SO

1449
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
HARD TO SAY, WOLF, AND WE HAVE

1450
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
COVERED SO MANY TRAGEDIES LIKE

1451
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
THIS.

1452
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
AND I THINK IT IS DISTINCTLY

1453
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
UNSATISFYING, BECAUSE I THINK

1454
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
THAT NOW PEOPLE EXPECT THAT

1455
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME

1456
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
ABSOLUTE ANSWER TO WHAT HAS

1457
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
HAPPENED HERE.

1458
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT

1459
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
THERE IS.
AND EVEN AS A MEDICAL SCIENTIST,

1460
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
WE'RE SO USED TO SAYING HERE IS

1461
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
THAT BLOCKAGE, LET'S HOPE THAT

1462
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
UP.
OR HERE IS HOW THIS NEEDS TO BE

1463
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
TREATED.

1464
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT IN

1465
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
CERTAIN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.

1466
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
>> BECAUSE I ASSUME THEY WILL DO

1467
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
AN AUTOPSY ON ADAM, AND TAKE A

1468
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
LOOK.
IF YOU WERE INVOLVED, WHAT WOULD

1469
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
YOU LOOK FOR?

1470
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
YOU'RE A NEUROSURGEON.

1471
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
>> WELL, YOU WOULD WANT TO SEE

1472
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING OBVIOUS

1473
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
IN THE BRAIN, ORGANIC IN THE

1474
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
BRAIN, THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK IN

1475
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
TERMS OF HOW HE DIED,

1476
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
SPECIFICALLY --
>> WELL, HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.

1477
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
>> HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.

1478
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
THEY WILL LOOK FOR THAT, AS

1479
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
WELL.
BUT IT IS UNLIKELY, WOULD BE MY

1480
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
GUESS, THAT THEY CAN SAY THIS IS

1481
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
AN EXPLANATION IN SOME WAY, OF

1482
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
ALL OF THIS.

1483
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
>> LIKE A PHYSICAL EXPLANATION.

1484
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
>> YEAH, WHETHER THERE WAS

1485
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
SOMETHING INHIBITING JUDGMENT OR

1486
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
WHETHER IT WOULD CAUSE SOMETHING

1487
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
LIKE THAT.

1488
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
BUT EVEN IF YOU DID FIND

1489
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO TAKE AN

1490
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
ORGANIC THING, AND TO SAY

1491
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
TRANSLATE THAT TO A SORT OF

1492
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
BEHAVIORAL THING, IT IS JUST

1493
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
HARD, WOLF.

1494
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
>> YOU WERE OVER AT ONE OF THE

1495
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
CRISIS CENTERS THAT WAS

1496
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
ESTABLISHED HERE, TALKING TO

1497
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
SOME OF THE MEDICAL

1498
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
PROFESSIONALS.
>> I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT,

1499
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
WOLF, I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

1500
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
BECAUSE THIS IS A TOWN THAT I
