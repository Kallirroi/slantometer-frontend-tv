ON.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE FOLKS

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
OUT THERE THAT ARE TRULY

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
HERORIC ALSO THE PROCESS OF

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
WHAT IT IS LIKE TO GATHER NEWS

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
ON THIS STORY.

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
>> WE ARE TOLD INITIALLY WHEN

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
THE CALLS CAME OUT THERE WAS A

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
SHOOTING IN THE ELEMENTARY

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
SCHOOL.
ON DUTY AND OFF DUTY OFFICERS

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
ALL RESPONDED AND WE HAVE BEEN

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
HEARING REPORTS OF SHATTERED

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
GLASS AND WE LEARNED THAT ALL

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
OF THAT EXTRA SHATTERED GLASS

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
IS BECAUSE THE SAME WAY THE

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
GUNMAN HAD TO FORCE HIMSELF IN

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
THE SCHOOL SINCE THEY DIDN'T

133
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
WANT HIM IN THERE, THE POLICE

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
AND ON DUARTEDUTY POLICE

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
OFFICERS HAD TO FORCE

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE SCHOOL

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
WAS ON LOCK DOWN AND TICHERS

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
AND STUDENTS WERE SO SCARED

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
AND WITH ALL OF THE FOURTH

140
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
GRADERS, YOU HEARD THEY CANNOT

141
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
WANT TO OPEN THE DOOR UNTIL

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
THE POLICE GOT THERE UNTIL

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
THEY SAW A BADGE.

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
IT DIFFICULT TO GATHER NEWS ON

145
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
THIS, WHEN YOU HEAR THE STORE

146
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
TORES AND TALK TO THE

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
COLLEAGUES AND THE LIBRARY

CLASSES THAT WERE NOT THERE.

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000

PRESENT OUT OF TWO ENTIRE

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
CLASSES AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
THE NUMBERS, IT IS STAGGERING.

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
AND INFORMATION FOR THEM.

159
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
AND WE WERE SPEAKING TO THE

160
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
LOCAL JOURNALIST AND THEY WERE

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
OVERCOME WITH EMOTION AS TO

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
COMMUNITY.
NYEAH.

164
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
IT IS DIFFICULT, AND IT IS ONE

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
OF THOSE THINGS, WHERE IT IS

166
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
IT A VERY, VERY MAUL TOWN, AND

167
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
EVERYONE.
AS SOMEBODY WHO IS THE HUSBAND

168
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
OF A TEACHER OF ANOTHER SCHOOL

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
IN THE DISTRICT.

170
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
NORMAL LOW WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT

171
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
A WORLD EVENT IT IS IT DEGREES

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
OF.
AND HERE IT IS IT ONE DEGREE.

173
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THE NAMES OF THE VICTIMS WILL

174
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
NOT BE RELEASED UNTIL THE

175
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER IS FINISHED

176
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000

THEY ARE ALL IDENTIFIED AND

178
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
REMOVED FROM THE SCHOOL.

179
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
BUT THE MEDICAL EXAMINER STILL

180
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
HAS WORK TO DO.

181
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
BUT THE FEAR THAT IS GRIPPING

182
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
THE FOLKS, WHEN THOSE COME OUT

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000

CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES THAT

337
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
WERE LOST.

338
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
THE NATION WONDERS HOW ONE MAN

339
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
CAN GO ON A RAMPAGE AND

340
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
CARNAGE.

341
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
THE ADULTS HELPED TO CIPH THE

342
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
CHILDREN AND PREVENT THE

343
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
CATASTROPHE FROM EVEN ACCIDENT

344
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
WORSE.

345
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
GENA.

346
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
NIT WAS A DIFFICULT TORE STORE

347
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
AND HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT STORY

348
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
AND CHALLENGING TO SAY THE

349
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
LEAST TO REPORT OUT.

350
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
ONE OF THE FIRST LESSONS YOU

351
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
LEARN AS A YOURNALIST.

352
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
FIRST REPORTS THAT YOU GET ARE

353
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
MOST INACCURATE.

354
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
OF THE HEROS WANTED THINGS

355
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
THAT WE LATER TOUND WERE NOT

356
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
TRUE.

357
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
AND YOU CAN SHARE THE LIGHT ON

358
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
THIS AS WELL.

359
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
TALK ABOUT THE THINGS WE NOW

360
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
LEARNED.
Y WA THE SHOOT ARES NAME IS

361
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
ADAM LANZA AND THE FATHER WAS

362
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
DEAD.
AND THOOTHAT IS NOT TRUE.

363
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
AS WE KNOW NOW.

364
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
AND ON THE AIR, FIRST HEARD

365
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
THAT THERE MIGHT BE TWO

366
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
SHOOTERS ON THE SCENE AND WE

367
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
LATER LEARNED AT LEAST

368
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS NOW

369
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
THAT THAT IS NOT TRUE.

370
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
>> IN THE EARLY PART OF THESE

371
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
INVESTIGATIONS.
THERE MIGHT BE MULTIPLE PHONE

372
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
CALL TO 911 AND YOU GET

373
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
DIFFERING DESCRIPTIONS AND I

374
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
SUPPOSE THAT'S THE REASON THAT

375
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
THEY THOUGHT WERE TOOTWO --

376
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
WHEN IT IS A DRILL.

563
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
THE FIRE ALARM GOES OFF AND IT

564
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
IS SCARY FOR THE LITTLE KIDS.

565
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I DON'T THINK UNTIL WE OPENED

566
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
THE DOOR AND THERE WERE COPS

567
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
WITH GIANTIC GUNS AND ESCORTED

568
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
THEM OUT DID THEY REAL.

569
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
>> WHAT WERE THE CHILDREN

570
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
SAYING IN THE CLOSEST.

571
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
NHOW LONG DID THAT TAKE?

572
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
>> WE DIDN'T KNOW AND WE LET

573
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
THEM IN AT FIRST.

574
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
THEY FOUNDED ON THE

575
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
THAPE WERE PLOSE AND THEY PUT

576
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
A BADGE FROM UNDER THE DOOR

577
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
AND WE LET THE KIDS OUT THEN.

578
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
WE GOT TO THE FIRE HOUSE AT

579
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
TIN TIME 30.

580
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
NYOU WERE THERE AN HOUR.

581
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
NI THINK SO.

582
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
NJOHN, MARY ANN US THEY HAD

583
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
GONE OVER THE DIFFERENT DRILLS

584
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
AND SHE WAS WITH THE 18 FOURTH

585
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
GRADERS AND TIGHT AS WE WERE

586
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
AROWN TRYING TO TALK TO HER.

587
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
AND ONE OF THE LUCKY THINGS,

588
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
IN THAT TORAGE CLOSEST THEY

589
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
HAD CRAYIONS AND PAPER AND

590
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
THEY TROYED TO GET THE KIDS TO

591
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
DRAW AND WORRY THEIR

592
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
QUESTIONS.
>> IT STATE YOUR NAMELY SOUNDS

593
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
LIKE SHE AND THE OTHER

594
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
TEACHERS DID A FANTASTIC JOB

595
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
OF KEEPING THE KIDS SAFE AS

596
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
THEY COULD.

597
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
THERE IS A REPORT OF IANITOR

598
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
RUNNING THROUGH THE HALLS

599
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
WARNING TEACHER TO KEEP THEIR

600
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
DOORS CLOYCED BECAUSE OF THE

601
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
SHOOTING.
TO MY KNOWLEDGE WE DON'T KNOW

602
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE JANITOR

603
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
AND WHETHER HE SURVIVED.

604
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY HAD

605
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
INSTALL A NEW SECURITY SYSTEM

606
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
AND COORDINATING LOCK DOWN

607
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
DRILLS.
DESPITE THE CAUTION THE GUNMAN

608
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
GOT N. >> WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT

609
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
WITH MICHAEL DORM.

610
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
IT IS IT A NONPROFIT

611
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
ORGANIZATION THAT HELPS COOLS

612
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
IMPROVE CRISIS PREPAREDNESS

613
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
AND CAMPUS SAFETY.
>> WOULD YOU SAY GIVEN WHAT WE

614
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
KNOW STOW FAR, THIS SCHOOL DID

615
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
A PRESIDENTY GOOD JOB OF

616
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
TAKING CARE OF THIS

617
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
UNIMAGINABLE SITUATION.

618
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
>> FIRST ALL OF OUR ANALYST

619
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
AND VOLUNTEERS WOULD LIKE TO

620
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
EXPRESS CONDOLENCES FOR THE

621
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE QUESTION.

622
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I HAVE DONE FONCE --

623
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
FORERENCIC EVASIONS AND IT IS

624
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
EARLY TO TELL.

625
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I AM SEEING INDICATIONS OF A

626
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
NUMBER OF GOOD THINGS THEY AM

627
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
HEARING.
ONE TO UNDERSTAND, A SIMPLE

628
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
ERROR CAN DRAMATICALLY CHANGE

629
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
THE CASULTIES DELAY OF LOCKING

630
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
A DOOR IN A LOCK DOWN IT CAN

631
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
CHANGE THE OUTCOME.

632
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
IT IS EARLY TO TELL.

633
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
A LOT OF THE THINGS I AM

634
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
HEARING AND WHY HAVE TO

635
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
REMEMBER THAT NOTHING IS IT

636
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
FOOL PROOF.
INE OUR BEST EFFORTS CAN'T

637
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
PROTECT US FROM SOME

638
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
SITUATIONS .

639
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
NWE UNDERSTAND FROM THE TIME

640
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
LINE THAT POLICE RELEASED THAT

641
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
THE GUNMAN SHOT AND KILLED HIS

642
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
OWN MOTHER.

643
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
IMAGINE THE DEPRAVITY THERE

644
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
CAN HEADS TO THE SCHOOL WITH

645
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
THE INTENTION OF OPENING FIRE.

646
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
EVEN A LOCKED SCHOOL DIDN'T

647
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
KEEP HIM OUT.
NOW THAT IS IT PRETTY MUCH

648
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
ROUTINE.
THIS SCHOOL WAS LOCKED AND WE

649
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
HEARD FROM LIEUTENANT PAUL

650
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
VANCE HE APARENTLY SHOT HIS

651
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
WAY IN AND MASHED HIS WAY IN

652
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
TO OPEN THE DOR.

653
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

654
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
PART OF THE SCHOOL IT SEEMS.

655
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
NWE HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR

656
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
WEAKEST HAPPENING LINTH'RE

657
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
LINK.

658
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
IF YOU HAVE GLASS AND SOMEONE

659
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
SHOOTS OUT A WIPO AND SCHOOLS

660
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
DON'T REALIZE THEY HAVE TO PUT

661
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
PROTECTIVE LAMINATE ON THE
CLASS .

662
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD HAVE

663
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
MAID A DIFFERENCE.

664
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I WORKED WITH LIEUTENANT VANCE

665
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
BEFORE AND HE IS A SHARP IPO

666
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
AND THEY ARE GETTING OUT

667
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
INFORMATION QUICKLY FOR THE

668
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
MAG MAGNITUDE OF THE DETAILS.

669
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
WE FOCUS ON EVIDENCE BASED

670
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
APPROACHES OF HOW PEOPLE

671
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
ACCOUNT UNDER STRESS .
