THE FACTOR BEGINS RIGHT NOW.

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
>> Bill: HI, I'M BILL

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
O'REILLY.
THANKS FOR WATCHING US

57
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
TONIGHT.
SECULAR FORCES ON THE MARCH,

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
EVENING'S TALKING POINTS MEMO.

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
AS WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING,

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
SOME COMMITTED LEFT WING

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
AMERICANS HAVE BEEN EMBOLDENED

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
BY THE RE-ELECTION OF

64
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
YOU ARE SEEING THAT NOW IN THE

66
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS AS THE

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
PRESIDENT AND HIS SIDE ARE NOT

68
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
IN ANY COMPROMISING MOOD.

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I SAW IT FIRSTHAND THIS WEEK

70
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
WHEN I WAS DOWN IN WASHINGTON.

71
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
THERE IS ARROGANCE AND

72
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
CONDESCENSION IN MANY LEFT

73
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
WING PRECINCTS DESPITE THE

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
FACT THAT U.N. AMBASSADOR

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
TODAY SUSAN RICE IS OUT OF

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
CONSIDERATION FOR SECRETARY OF

77
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
STATE.
WE WILL MORE ON THAT WITH BOB

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
BECKEL COMING UP.

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
THE MORE SECULAR PROGRESSIVES

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
UNDERSTAND NOW IS THEIR TIME

81
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
IN HISTORY.

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
THE AGENDA IS CLEAR.

83
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
ABOVE ALL THE SECULAR FORCES

84
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
WANT TO CHANGE THE ECONOMY.

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
THEY WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO

86
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
RUN IT AND PROVIDE GRADDLE TO

87
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
GRAVE ENTITLEMENTS FOR THOSE

88
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
AMERICANS WHO CANNOT OR WILL

89
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
NOT PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES.

90
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
THE LEFT ALSO WANTS TO CONTROL

91
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
PROFITS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

92
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
TAKING AS MUCH MONEY AS

93
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
POSSIBLE AWAY FROM THE

94
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
ACHIEVERS AND THE

95
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
CORPORATIONS.

96
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
AGAIN, WITH THE INTENT TO

97
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
REDISTRICT THE CASH.

98
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
SO THAT'S AGENDA NUMBER ONE.

99
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
NUMBER TWO, IS TO OBLITERATE

100
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
SOME AMERICAN TRADITIONS.

101
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
GAY MARRIAGE, NOT ABOUT

102
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
MATRIMONY ANYMORE.

103
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
IT'S ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS.

104
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
AND IF YOU OPPOSE GAY MARRIAGE

105
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
YOU ARE A HATER, A RIGHTS

106
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
DENIER.

107
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
LEGALIZED NARCOTICS, THE LEFT

108
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
SEES DRUG USERS AS VICTIMS AND

109
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
BELIEVES NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO

110
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
STAND BETWEEN AN AMERICAN AND

111
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
INTOXICATION MUCH.

112
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
ON THAT NOTE THE "NEW YORK

113
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
TIMES" RAN A FRONT PAGE

114
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
ARTICLE YESTERDAY LAMENTING

115
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
TOUGH MANDATORY PRISON

116
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
SENTENCES FOR DRUG DEALERS.

117
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
THE LEFT BELIEVES THEY ARE NOT

118
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
VIOLENT OFFENDERS.

119
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
SO IF YOU ARE SELLING METH,

120
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
HEROIN, COCAINE, THAT'S NOT AN

121
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
ACT THAT CAUSES HARM OR PAIN

122
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
TO ANOTHER PERSON, OH, NO.

123
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

124
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW

125
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
FIRSTHAND ABOUT ADDICTION KNOW

126
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
HOW CRAZY THAT POINT OF VIEW

127
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
IS.

128
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
PEOPLE WHO SELL DRUGS ARE THE

129
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
LOWEST RUNG.

130
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
THEY ARE COMMITTING VIOLENCE

131
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
AGAINST OTHER HUMAN BEINGS.

132
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
PERIOD.

133
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
"TIMES" ARTICLE SAYS A HALF

134
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
MILLION PEOPLE ARE IN PRISON

135
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
FOR DRUG OFFENSES IN THE

136
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
U.S.A.

137
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
10 TIMES THE NUMBER THAN IN

138
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
1980.

139
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THAT SOUNDS BAD, DOESN'T IT?

140
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
WHAT THE PAPER DOES NOT, DOES

141
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
NOT TELL YOU IS THAT VIOLENT

142
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
RHYME IN -- CRIME IN AMERICA

143
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
HAS BEEN CUT IN HALF SINCE THE

144
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
TOUGH MANDATORY PRISON

145
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
SENTENCES WERE INSTITUTED.

146
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
THE COUNTRY IS MUCH SAFER

147
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
BECAUSE HARD CORE CRIMINALS

148
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
ARE DOING HARD TIME.

149
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THAT'S A FACT.

150
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
NO ONE SHOULD FEEL SORRY FOR

151
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
KILLERS, RAPISTS AND DRUG

152
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
PUSHERS.

153
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
NOW, BECAUSE I DO COMMENTARY

154
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
LIKE THIS, LAYING OUT THE

155
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
PROGRESSIVE AGENDA, I'M A BIG

156
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
THREAT TO THEM.

157
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
LISTEN TO THIS INCREDIBLE

158
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
SOUND BITE FROM COMMITTED LEFT

159
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
WING GUY HARRY BELL BELAFONTE

160
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
HE SAYS PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO

161
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
OPPOSE PRESIDENT OBAMA AND

162
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
LIBERAL AGENDA ON SOME THINGS

163
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
SHOULD BE DEALT WITH.

164
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
>> WHAT FASCINATES ME IS THAT

165
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
IN THE PHASE OF MILLIONS OF

166
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
AMERICANS EXPRESSING THEIR

167
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
DESIRE THE WHOLE POLITICAL

168
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
ESTABLISHMENT DEFINING ITS

169
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
GAME THAT THERE SHOULD BE THIS

170
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
LINGERING INFESTATION OF

171
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
REALLY CORRUPT PEOPLE WHO SIT

172
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
TRYING TO DISMANTLE THE WISHES

173
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
OF THE PEOPLE, THE MANDATE

174
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO BARACK

175
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
OBAMA AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT

176
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
MORE THEY WANT.

177
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR BARACK

178
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
OBAMA TO DO IS TO ORGANIZE A

179
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THIRD WORLD DICTATOR AND PUT

180
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
ALL THESE GUYS IN JAIL.

181
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
VIOLATING THE AMERICAN DESIRE.

182
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
>> Bill: I GUESS VIOLATING THE

183
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
AMERICAN DESIRE IS A FELONY

184
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
NOW, RIGHT, HARRY?

185
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
MAYBE THE GUY WAS JUST

186
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
KIDDING.

187
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
MAYBE.

188
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
BUT, BELIEVE ME, ANYONE IN

189
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
THIS COUNTRY WHO CHALLENGES

190
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
THE SECULAR PROGRESSIVE AGENDA

191
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
IS GOING TO GET HAMMERED.

192
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
THESE PEOPLE ARE ON A MISSION.

193
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
THEY WANT A COMPLETELY

194
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
DIFFERENT AMERICA.

195
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
A COUNTRY THAT EMBRACES SOCIAL

196
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
JUSTICE, LIBERTINE BEHAVIOR

197
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
AND SECULAR IN EVERY WAY.

198
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
THAT BRINGS US TO THE

199
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
CHRISTMAS CONTROVERSY WHICH IS

200
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
SYMBOLIC, SYMBOLIC OF THE
ENTIRE CULTURE WAR.

201
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
WAR ON CHRISTMAS IS OVER AND

202
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
TRADITIONAL FORCES HAVE WON.

203
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
THE MAGAZINE CITING RETAIL

204
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
STORES ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO

205
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
NOW SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS TO THE

206
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
SHOPPERS.

207
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
A FEW YEARS AGO SOME

208
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
CORPORATIONS WERE FORBIDDEN.

209
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
THEY WERE TELLING EMPLOYEES

210
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
THEY COULDN'T DO THAT.

211
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
WELL WAR ON CHRISTMAS HAS

212
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
LARGELY GONE OUR WAY.

213
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
DON'T THINK THE DEAL IS OVER.

214
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
IT'S NOT.

215
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
LISTEN TO NEXT CHANGE ABOUT

216
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY ON "THE

217
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000

218
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
>> I FOCUS ON, HONESTLY THE

219
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
RELIGION PART OF IT.
I REALLY AND TRULY DO.

220
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
SO I CAN'T OUTSOURCE THAT PART

221
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
OF IT.

222
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
CAN I SEND YOU TO GET MY TREE

223
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
BUT I CAN'T HELP -- YOU CAN'T

224
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
HELP ME.
>> I DON'T LIKE THE RELIGION

225
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
PART.

226
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I THINK RELIGION IS WHAT MUCKS

227
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
THE WHOLE THING UP.

228
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
[ LAUGHTER ]

229
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000

WITH DR. SNYDERMAN THERE THAT

231
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
BECAUSE CHRISTMAS HONORS JESUS

232
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
WHOM SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE IS

233
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
GOD, IT IS MUCKED UP.

234
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
MUCKED UP SO TO SPEAK.

235
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
TV WRITER FRAZIER MOORE

CHRIST IN CHRISTMAS.

241
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
AT THE SAME TIME HE PROCLAIMS
THAT EVERYONE, NO MATTER THEIR

242
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
FAITH, SHOULD CALL A CHRISTMAS

243
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
TREE A CHRISTMAS TREE AND

244
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
KNOCK OFF THEIR WHINING.

245
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
NO ONE INTELLIGENT PERSON

246
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
COULD POSSIBLY SEE A SECULAR

247
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
POSSIBLY SEE A SECULAR DISPLAY

248

249
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000

CHRISTIAN RELIGION, UNQUOTE.

255
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
MR. MOORE IS OFFEND OD THAT I

256
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
WANT A CHRISTMAS TREE TO BE

257
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
CALLED A CHRISTMAS TREE.

258
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
HE SEES IT AS AN ATTACK ON HIS

259
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
VALUE SYSTEM.

260
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
MOORE IS ONE OF THE LEGIONS OF

261
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
MEDIA WHO HAVE FORMED A

262
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
SECULAR CLOWN POSEY.

263
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO

264
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
BLANKING IDEA WHAT THIS

265
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ON.

266
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
SO I'M GOING TO SPEAK VERY

267
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
SLOWLY TO YOU FRAZIER, PLEASE

00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
TAKE SOME NOTES AND HAVE THAT

269
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
DICTIONARY HANDY.

270
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
CHRISTIANITY IS A RELIGION FOR

271
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
THOSE WHO BELIEVE JESUS IS IS

272
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
GOD.

273
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
AND FOR THOSE WHO JOIN A

274
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
SPECIFIC CHURCH TO CELEBRATE

275
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
THAT BELIEF.

276
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
BUT CHRISTIANITY IS A

277
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
PHILOSOPHY TO PEOPLE LIKE

278
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
THOMAS JEFFERSON WHO DID NOT

279
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
BELIEVE THAT JESUS WAS THE

280
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
DEITY.

281
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
AND MR. JEFFERSON, AS WELL AS

282
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
MANY OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS,

283
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
INCORPORATED THE

284
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
JUDEO-CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY

285
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
INTO THE CONSTITUTION.

286
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
THAT'S WHY THE 10 COMMANDMENTS

287
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
HANG IN THE SUPREME COURT

288
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
BUILDING.
ARE YOU WITH ME SO FAR,

289
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
FRAZIER?

290
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
IMAGES OF THE MANGER SCENE IN

291
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THE PUBLIC SQUARE SIMPLY HONOR

292
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
THE BABY JESUS, THE HUMAN

293
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
BEING.

294
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
THE BABY IS NOT SITTING AT THE

295
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
RIGHT HAND OF GOD.

296
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
HE IS LAYING THERE FLANKED BY

297
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
HIS PARENTS.
IT'S LIKE THE MARTIN LUTHER

298
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
KING JR. HOLIDAY, FRAZIER.

299
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
DR. KING HONORED AS A MAN WHO

300
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
HELPED HUMANITY.

301
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
AT CHRISTMAS, JESUS IS HONORED

302
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
AS A MAN WHO HELPED HUMANITY.

303
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE JESUS

304
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
IS GOD, THEN YOU CAN TAKE THAT

305
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
FURTHER AS IS YOUR

306
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT.

307
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
IF YOU DON'T BUY THE RELIGIOUS

308
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
ASPECT.

309
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
CAN YOU JUST CELEBRATE THE
FEDERAL HOLIDAY THAT WAS

310
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
SIGNED INTO LAW PRESIDENT

311
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
GRANT, WITH NO PROVISION,

312
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
FRAZIER, THAT EVERYONE WORSHIP

313
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
JESUS.

314
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
NOT PART OF THE DEAL.

315
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
ARE YOU STILL WITH ME?

316
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
OR IS THIS TOO COMPLICATED FOR

317
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
YOU?

318
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
HERE IS THE BIG PICTURE.

319
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
THE SECULAR PROGRESSIVE AGENDA

320
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
IS OPPOSED BY MANY PEOPLE OF

321
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
FAITH.

322
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
ABORTION, GAY MARRIAGE,

323
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
LEGALIZED DRUGS, ALL OF THOSE

324
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
THINGS ARE OPPOSED BY MANY

325
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
RELIGIOUS AMERICANS.

326
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
THAT IS WHY SOME FAR LEFT

327
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
FOLKS WANT TO DIMINISH

328
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
JUDEO-CHRISTIAN TRADITION AND

329
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
RENAME THE CHRISTMAS TREE THE

330
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
HOLIDAY TREE.

331
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
THE LESS CHRISTMAS, THE

332
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
BETTER.

333
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
THE SECULAR PEOPLE ARE NOW

334
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER.

335
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
THEIR GUY HAS BEEN RIO HE

336
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
ELECTED AND OPPOSING FORCES

337
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
ARE SCATTERED.

338
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
AND THAT IS WHAT IS GOING ON

339
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
IN AMERICA ON DECEMBER 13TH,

340
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
2012.

341
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
AND THAT'S THE MEMO.

>> I DON'T KNOW WHO FRAZIER

362
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
MOORE WAS.

363
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
HE JUST GOT HIS BUTT SKINNED

364
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
BY YOU IF I WERE HIM I

365
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000

DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

370
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
BETWEEN CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY

371
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
AND THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION AND

372
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
MOST PEOPLE DON'T.

373
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000

IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE

391
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
SUGGESTING.
>> Bill: NO THEY WANT CHANGE.

DO YOU KNOW THAT A MAJORITY OF

399
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000

DEFINED AS CIVIL RIGHTS.

404
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
>> YOU SAY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

405
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000

406
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
>> NOT MAJORITY.

407
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
>> HALF THE COUNTRY.

408
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000

HOW?
>> HE LAUGHED.

429
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000

BECAUSE IT WAS SO INSANE.

434
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
>> YOU THINK HARRY BELAFONTE

435
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
WANTS TO LOCK YOU UP?

436
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE

437
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
EXERCISE.
>> Bill: I THINK HARRY

438
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
BELAFONTE WOULD PROBABLY

439
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
EMBRACE ANYTHING THAT WOULD

440
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS

441
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
POLITICALLY.

457
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
LITTLE TAX HIKE.

458
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
IT'S ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT

459
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
TAKING OVER THE ECONOMY.

FOLKS ON THE BUDGET DEBATE

559
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
>> IMPACT SEGMENT TONIGHT BY

560
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
ALMOST EVERY MEASURE

561
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
TRADITIONAL FORCES IN AMERICA
ARE UNDER SIEGE JUST BY WHAT

562
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
BOB BECKEL SAYS.

563
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
HOW SHOULD INDIVIDUAL

564
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
AMERICANS REACT TO THAT ON

565
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
BOTH SIDES?

566
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
JOINING US NOW FROM WASHINGTON

567
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
LAURA INGRAHAM.

568
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
ALL RIGHT, YOU HEARD MY

569
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
TALKING POINTS AND YOU HEARD

570
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
BOB BECKEL AND THE DISCUSSION

571
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
GO.
>> FIRST OF ALL DID PURR RENO

572
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
PERINO AND GUTFELD PUT

573
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
BECKEL'S HEAD IN A DEVICE AND

574
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
SQUEEZE IT?
WHAT'S GOING ON.

575
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
NO PROBLEMS ON CHRISTMAS.

576
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
NO ATTACKS ON RELIGION IN THE

577
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
PUBLIC SQUARE.

578
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
SUSAN RICE WAS TREATED

579
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
UNFAIRLY.

580
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
LIVING IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE

581
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
HERE.
LOOK, I THINK MOST PEOPLE

582
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
REALIZE THAT AFTER THE

583
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
ELECTION AS OFTEN HAPPENS IN

584
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
POLITICS THE SIDE THAT WINS,

585
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
DEMOCRATS FEEL VERY HEADY,

586
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
VERY COCKY.

587
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
FEEL LIKE THE COUNTRY HAS

588
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
SHIFTED SO MUCH BOTH

589
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
POLITICALLY AND CULTURALLY

590
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
THAT THEY CAN PUSH THEIR

591
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
ISSUES.

592
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
>> AND THEY ARE.

593
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
>> Laura: PUSH MORE BENEFITS

594
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

595
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
TAKE THE FIGHT AGAINST

596
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
RELIGION AND CHRISTMAS.

597
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
AND THEY CAN DO A VARIETY OF

598
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
THINGS.
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IN THE

599
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
END, BILL, IS THAT IT'S ALMOST

600
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
ALWAYS OVERREACHING ON THE

601
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
PART OF THE COCKY PARTY, THE

602
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
CONCRETED PARTY.

603
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
IN THIS CASE OF COURSE IT'S

604
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
THE DEMOCRATS AND MORE LIBERAL

605
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
DEMOCRATS.

606
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
THEY OVERREACH.

607
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
AMERICA KIND OF BRISTLES AND

608
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
THE PEOPLE INVARIABLY WILL SAY

609
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
WOE WOE WOE WOE WOE, MAYBE WE

610
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
DIDN'T LIKE ROMNEY SO MUCH.

611
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
MAYBE WE WEREN'T THAT EXCITED

612
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
ABOUT HIM BUT WE THARNT

613
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
EITHER.

614
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
TAKE IT SLOW.
LET US LIVE OUR LIVES AND

615
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
DON'T TRY TO PUSH TRADITION

616
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
OUT OF ALL ASPECTS OF THE

617
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
AMERICAN CULTURE.
I THINK DEMOCRATS ARE AT LISK

618
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
OF DOING THAT ONCE AGAIN.

619
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
>> Bill: OKAY.

620
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF I WERE

621
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
A SECULAR PROGRESSIVE.

622
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
>> YEAH.

623
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
AND I WAS ON THAT SIDE I WOULD

624
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
PUT THE PEDAL TO THE METAL THE

625
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
PARTY HAS TO ORGANIZE.

626
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
OLD LEADERSHIP IS OUT, NEW

627
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
LEADERSHIP HAS TO COME BACK

628
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
IN.
RATINGS FOR A LOT OF THE

629
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE ARE DOWN.

630
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
THOSE PEOPLE WHO BACK ROMNEY

631
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
BIG TIME AND SAID WIN THE

632
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
ELECTION PEOPLE HAVE FLED AND

633
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
THEY ARE CONFUSED.

634
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
SO IF I'M A SECULAR

635
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
PROGRESSIVE AND, LOOK, HARRY

636
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
BELAFONTE COMING OUT AND I

637
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
DON'T KNOW WHETHER HARRY WAS
KIDDING AROUND OR NOT.

638
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I MEAN, HE WASN'T SMILING BUT

639
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
MAYBE HARRY DOESN'T SMILE.

640
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
>> IS HE A COMMITTED LEFTIST.

641
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
>> Bill: BUT WHEN HE SAYS HEY,

642
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
IF YOU DON'T AGREE DESIRE OF

643
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,

644
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
WE HAVE GOT A JAIL CELL FOR

645
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
YOU.

646
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GETTING REALLY

647
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
NOW INTO A PRETTY INTERESTING

648
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
SITUATION.
>> IT'S LIKE JEFFREY IMMELT

649
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
SAYING KIND OF PRAISING CHINA

650
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
RECENTLY BECAUSE THEY CAN MAKE

651
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
SOME GOOD BUSINESS DECISIONS

652
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
FOR THEMSELVES SO THE WHOLE

653
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
SYSTEM MIGHT BE SOMEWHAT ADD

654
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
ADMIRABLE.

655
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I THINK THEY ARE REVEALING

656
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
WHAT THEY IN MANY WAYS REALLY

657
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
THINK.
IT WASN'T TOO MANY YEARS AGO

658
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

659
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
HARRY BELAFONTE COMMENTS ABOUT

660
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
CONDOLEEZZA RICE AND EVEN

661
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
COLIN POWELL WHEN HE SAID THEY

662
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
WERE LIVING IN THE HOUSE OF

663
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
THE MASTER.

664
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
HE WASN'T JOKING THEN.

665
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
HE MAY BE OVERSTATED A LITTLE

666
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
BIT MAYBE FOR HIM.

667
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
>> Bill: IS HE EMBOLDENED.

668
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
>> OF COURSE.

669
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
>> Bill: NOBODY CARES ABOUT

670
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
HARRY BELAFONTE.
>> THAT SONG IS IN MY HEAD

671
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
RUINING THE CHRISTMAS SEASON

672
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
BANANA BOAT.

673
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
>> Bill: SUN GOES DOWN. I LIKE

674
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
THAT SONG.

675
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I USED HIM NOT BECAUSE HE HAS

676
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
CREDIBILITY AND THAT IS HE

677
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
SOMEBODY THAT PEOPLE LISTEN

678
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
TO, BUT TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE

679
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
OF WHAT IS BEING SAID IN THE

680
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
SALONS AT THE HUFFINGTON POST.

681
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING, YOU

682
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
KNOW WHAT?

683
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
IF YOU OPPOSE PRESIDENT OBAMA

684
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
NOW AND YOU OPPOSE THE SECULAR

685
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
PROGRESSIVE AGENDA WE'RE GOING

686
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
TO DEAL WITH YOU.

687
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
LOOK, THE ATTACKS ON ME, LOOK,

688
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I HAVE A STACK OF NEWS CLIPS

689
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BECAUSE

690
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
HOW DARE O'REILLY, HOW DARE HE

691
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
STAND IN OUR WAY AND POINT

692
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
THESE THINGS OUT.

693
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
WE'LL GO AFTER HIM ANY

694
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
INSTITUTION OR MEDIA SOURCE

695
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
THAT ACTUALLY EXPOSES WHAT

696
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
THEY REALLY THINK OR EVEN

697
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
QUESTIONS THEM HOW DARE YOU DO

698
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
THAT?

699
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
KANYE WEST TO BELAFONTE.

700
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
CHRISTMAS SEASON.
ANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT

701
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
DISAGREE ON THIS THEN YOU ARE

702
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
SOMEHOW ILLEGITIMATE.

703
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

704
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'M NOT EVEN NECESSARILY

705
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
BLAMING THEM BECAUSE THAT'S

706
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
WHO THEY ARE.

707
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
THEY DON'T LIKE, YOU KNOW,

708
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES.

709
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
THEY DON'T MUCH LIKE FISCAL

710
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
CONSERVATIVES.
THEY THINK THEY ARE SCARIER,

711
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
FRANKLY THAN AL QAEDA.

712
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
>> Bill: THEY DON'T LIKE

713
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
CHRISTIAN PEOPLE WHO SAY THIS

714
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
IS WHAT I BELIEVE AND.

715
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
>> SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE

716
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
CHRISTIANS.
THAT'S HATEFUL.

717
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
>> GAY MARRIAGE ISSUE TO ME

718
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
THAT'S NOT.

719
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
>> MOTIVATE YOUR EVERY BREATH.

720
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
>> Bill: I DON'T THINK THAT'S

721
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
GOING TO ERODE IF THE SUPREME

722
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
COURT RULES ON THE SIDE IT'S

723
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
GOING TO ERODE THE FABRIC OF

724
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
THE COUNTRY.
I UNDERSTAND WHY SOME

725
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
RELIGIOUS PEOPLE AND

726
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
TRADITIONAL AMERICANS SAY YOU
KNOW WHAT?

727
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
IT'S JUST -- IT'S NOT THE SAME

728
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
COUNTRY.
IT'S NOT WHAT WE WERE BUILT ON

729
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
HERE.

730
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
>> I DON'T THINK WHAT'S
HAPPENING NOW IS THAT THOSE

731
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
PEOPLE ARE DEMONIZED.

732
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
COMPASSIONATE THEY MIGHT HAVE

733
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
A DEEPL RELIGIOUS BELIEF

734
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
OR MORAL BELIEF THAT CONFLICTS

735
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
WITH THE POPULAR CULTURE.

736
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
LOOK, I DON'T BLAME THEM FOR

737
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
BEING VERY HEADY AND VERY

738
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
EXCITED ABOUT THEIR POLITICAL

739
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
OPPORTUNITIES BUT I CAUTION

740
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
AGAINST WHAT HAPPENED.

741
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
>> IF YOU ARE ARRESTED IN THE

742
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000

768
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000

MILITANT FEMINISM MAKING A

777
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
COMEBACK.
CAMILLE WROTE AN ARTICLE IN

778
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER HASHLY

779
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
CRITICIZING KATIE PERRY AND

780
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
TAYLOR SWIFT CALLING THEM

781
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
INSIPID.
SHE THINKS THEY SHOULD BE

782
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
QUOTE POWERFUL MODELS OF

783
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
MATURE BOMBINGLINESS UNQUOTE.

784
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
HERE ARE TWO LADIES WHO FIGHT

785
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
FIT THAT DESCRIPTION GRETCHEN

786
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
CARLSON AND JEANINE PIRRO.

787
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
SO WHY DON'T YOU DEFINE THE

788
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
POINT THAT MS. PAGGALA ARE

789
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
TRYING TO MAKE.

790
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
>> SHE IS SAYING THERE ARE

791
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
SUCCESSFUL WOMEN LIKE KATIE

792
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000

FORBES MAGAZINE MAKE MORE

794
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
MONEY THAN JUST ABOUT ANYONE

795
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
IN TERMS OF THEIR MUSIC.

796
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
SHE IS SAYING THAT THEY ARE

797
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
INSIPID THAT THEIR MUSIC IS

798
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
BLAND AND THAT THEY ARE

799
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
MONOTONOUS AND AT THE END OF

800
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
THE DAY THEY ARE TOO BUTTONED

801
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
UP.
HER CONCERN IS THAT THEY ARE

802
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
NOT TRASHY AND THEY DON'T

803
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
REFLECT KIND OF A SENSE OF

804
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
REAL LIVING.
AND SHE TALKS ABOUT BLACK

805
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
FEMALE PERFORMERS AS STRONGER

806
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
AND MORE DEFIANT.

807
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
SHE IGNORES THE FACT THAT

808
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
PEOPLE BUY THEIR RECORDS

809
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
BECAUSE THEY LIKE MUSIC AND

810
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
SHE PREFERS WOMEN WHO

811
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
APPARENTLY IN HER MIND SHOW

812
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
MORE BODY, MORE BOSOM, MORE

813
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
BOOTY AND, THEREFORE, WE ARE

814
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
GOING BACKWARDS.

815
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
>> Bill: KATIE PERRY IS NOT

816
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
KNOWN -- DID YOU SEE IT.
>> I SAW AMAZINGLY ANGRY

817
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
FEMALE WRITING AN ARTICLE

818
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
ABOUT OTHER SUCCESSFUL WOMEN

819
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
WHO IS SHE IS PROBABLY JEALOUS

820
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
OF.
BY THE WAY BEYONCE, TAYLOR

821
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
SWIFT TO A CERTAIN DEGREE

822
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
KATIE PERRY ARE GOOD ROLE

823
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
MODELS.

824
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
>> Bill: SHE DIDN'T CRITICIZE

825
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
BEYONCE.
>> NO.

826
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
>> Bill: YOU WOULD NEVER DARE

827
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
DO THAT.
THAT WOULD BE SO

828
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
POLITICALLY -- LET'S STAY WITH

829
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
THE POINT.

830
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
TAYLOR SWIFT 23 YEARS OLD

831
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
TODAY.

832
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I THINK SHE IS A GOOD ROLE

833
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
MODEL.
I KNOW THE FAMILY A LITTLE

834
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
BIT.

835
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I THINK SHE TRIES TO PUT

836
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
FORTH.

837
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
KATIE PERRY I DON'T KNOW

838
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
ANYTHING ABOUT HER.

839
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
BUT PAGLIA WHO TEACHES IN

840
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
PHILADELPHIA AT SOME ARTS

841
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
COLLEGE SHE WANTS THE WOMEN TO

842
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
DO WHAT.

843
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
WHAT DOES SHE WANT.

844
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
WHAT'S THIS BOMBINGLINESS

845
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
THING WHAT.

846
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
>> TRASHY DURING THE DAY.

847
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
REMINISCENT OF THE 19 AUTOS

848
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
WHEN PEOPLE WERE COMPLACENT

849
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
AND WAITED FOR THE MEN TO COME

850
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
HOME.
>> Bill: TOO HARD TO BELIEVE

851
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
THAT SHE WANTS THEM TO BE

852
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
DRESSED?
DID YOU TAKE THAT AWAY FROM

853
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
THE ARTICLE?

854
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
>> SHE MAN PLEASING WAYS HAD

855
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
TO BE PEPPY, CHEERFUL AND

856
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
MODEST.

857
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
>> HERE IS PART OF IT.

858
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
WHO DOES SHE THINK IS A GOOD

859
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
ROLE MODEL IN THE SINGING

860
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
WORLD?

861
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
MADONNA.

862
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
>> Bill: MADONNA.
>> WHO WE JUST TALKED ABOUT A

863
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
COUPLE WEEKS AGO AS NOT BEING

864
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
A ROLE MODEL.

865
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
>> SHE STRIPPED DOWN.

866
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
SHE IS OBJECTING TO THE

867
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
CLOTHING, BILL.
SHE DOES IT OVER AND OVER

868
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
AGAIN.
>> Bill: I HAVEN'T BEEN IN

869
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
THIS FEMINIST THING.

870
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
WEREN'T FEMINIST AT ONE TIME

871
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
ANGRY ABOUT WOMEN BEING

872
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
OBJECTIFIED?
>> SEXUALIZED.

873
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
>> Bill: NOW SHE WANTS THEM TO
BE?

874
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
>> I GUESS.

875
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
>> REMEMBER WHEN WE HAD

876
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE NATIONAL

877
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
ORGANIZATION OF AMERICA WOULD
NOT LET ME IN BECAUSE I WAS A

878
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
FORMER MISS AMERICA EVEN

879
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
THOUGH I WENT TO STANFORD AND

880
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
OXFORD THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T

881
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
BECAUSE I WAS IN WHAT THEY
DEEM A PAGEANT.

882
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
>> Bill: NOW THEY WANT YOUNGER

883
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
WOMEN TO BE MORE FLASHY AND

884
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
OBJECTIFIED?

885
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'M NOT GETTING ANY OF.

886
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
THIS I DIDN'T GET IT EITHER.

887
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I WAS VERY CONFUSED.

888
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
>> MODEST AND SHE DOESN'T WANT

889
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
THEM TO BE THE PLAN,

890
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
CULTIVATED.
THIS IS MY CHRISTMASER GO THIS

891
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
-- PREMISE THERE GO THIS

892
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
IS MY CONCLUSION.

893
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
>> Bill: SHE WANTS PUBLICITY.
SHE HAS BEEN OUT OF THE

894
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
LIMELIGHT.
SHE GETS THE HOLLYWOOD

895
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
REPORTER WHICH IS NOW SOME

896
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
KIND OF LEFT WING THING TO RUN

897
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
THIS PIECE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT

898
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
IT THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS.

899
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT

900
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
ALL.

901
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
>> IT DOESN'T.

902
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
>> Bill: PERRY AND SWIFT PUT

903
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
OUT RECORDS THAT PEOPLE LIKE.

904
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING

905
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
OFFENSIVE TO ME.

906
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THAT

907
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
THEY HAVE DONE.

908
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
ALL THEY ARE DOING IS MAKING

909
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
AN HONEST LIVING AND NOW SHE

910
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
SAYS THEY ARE NOT

911
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
BOMBINGLINESS.
IS THERE A WORD

912
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
WOMANINGLYNESS?

913
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
>> YES.
WE WILL TAKE IT.

914
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
>> THE MAN DID NOTHING WRONG.

915
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
MEGYN KELLY ON THE CASE IN

916
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT

920
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
BEGINNING WITH THE TERRIBLE
ORDEAL OF 27-YEAR-OLD JOHN

925
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
MEXICANS PUT HIM IN PRISON

926
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
AFTER HE REGISTERED ANTIQUE

927
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
GUN WITH THE U.S. BORDER

928
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
PATROL.
THEN HE CROSSED INTO MEXICO.

929
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
APPARENTLY THE MEXICAN

930
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
AUTHORITIES SAW THE PAPERWORK

931
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
AND IMMEDIATELY ARRESTED

932
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
CORPORAL HAMMAR ON GUN

933
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
CHARGES.

934
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
THAT WAS FOUR MONTHS AGO AND

935
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
HE IS STILL IN PRISON.

936
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
SENATOR BILL NELSON SAID THIS.

937
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
>> BRING THIS MARINE HOME,

938
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT.

939
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
AND NOW THAT YOU HAVE A NEW

940
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
PRESIDENT JUST INSTALLED IN

941
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
MEXICO, THE RELATIONS WITH THE

942
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
UNITED STATES ARE ESPECIALLY

943
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
IMPORTANT TO TREAT THE UNITED

944
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
STATES CITIZENS WHO ARE

945
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
PEACEFUL IN THEIR INTENT,

946
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
INNOCENT IN THEIR OBSERVATION

947
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
OF THE MEXICAN LAWS.

948
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
>> Bill: HERE NOW AND ATTORNEY

949
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
FOX NEWS ANCHOR MEGYN KELLY

950
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
LOOKING AT THE STORY.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS, RIGHT?

951
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
>> STOTTLELY RIDICULOUS.

952
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
>> WHY DON'T THEY TURN HIM

953
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
AWAY AT THE BORDER.

954
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
>> Bill: ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS

955
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
THAT TAKING THE ANTIQUE GUN TO

956
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
COSTA RICA TO GO HUNTING.

957
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
THAT WASN'T SMART ON HIS PART.

958
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
YOU GO TO MEXICO, DON'T DO

959
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
ANYTHING, DON'T TAKE ANYTHING,

960
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
DON'T DRIVE THERE, JUST FLY,

961
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
IN GO TO YOUR RESORT HOTEL.

962
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
AND GET THE HELL OUT.

963
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
>> YOU REALLY HAVE TO THINK

964
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
DON'T BOTHER GOING UNTIL

965
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
MR. HAMMAR GETS OUT OF PRISON.

966
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
>> Bill: I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
SHOULD GO.

967
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
>> THIS GUY SERVES OUR COUNTRY

968
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
HONORABLY.

969
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
HE HAD TO GOES INTO PROST

970
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
TRAUMATIC STRESS TREATMENT.

971
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
HIS BUDDIES HAD GOTTEN KILLED

972
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
DURING SERVICE.

973
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
HE GETS OUT OF THAT AND HE

974
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
GOES JUST TO HAVE A SURFING

975
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
TRIP.
>> Bill: JUST TO GO DOWN AND

976
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

977
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
>> NOT LIKE HE IS TRYING TO

978
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
PULL A FAST ONE.

979
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
REGISTERED WITH U.S. CUSTOMS

980
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
AND THOUGHT MEXICANS SAY

981
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
THAT'S IT.
YOU ARE ARE GOING TO

982
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
IMMEDIATELY TO JAIL.

983
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
HERE IS THE IRONY ABOUT IT

984
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
WHAT HAS OUR STATE DEPARTMENT

985
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
DONE?
WE HAVE MADE A FEW PHONE

986
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
CALLS.

987
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
THE PARENTS ARE VERY UPSET
THAT THE U.S. CONSULATE HASN'T

988
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
DONE MORE.

989
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
TYPICALLY THE WAY THIS WORKS

990
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
OUR STATE DEPARTMENT CALLS

991
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
THEIR STATE DEPARTMENT AND

992
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
FUNNELS DOWN THE LINE UNTIL

993
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
THEY GET TO THE STATE POLICE

994
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
AND THEY SAY DON'T BE

995
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
RIDICULOUS.
THIS ISN'T ONE OF THOSE

996
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
SITUATIONS WHERE SOMEBODY GOES

997
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
HIKING OVER AND ACCIDENTLY

998
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
CROSSES INTO IRAN.

999
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
THIS IS MEXICO.

1000
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
THAT'S AN ALLY OF OURS.

1001
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
WE GIVE THEM HUNDREDS OF

1002
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR,

1003
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
BILL.
WHY ISN'T IT JUST A PHONE

1004
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
CALL.

1005
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
>> Bill: LET'S BE HONEST THEY

1006
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
DISRESPECT US ALL THE TIME

1007
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
MEXICO.
NUMBER ONE, HILLARY CLINTON

1008
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THIS

1009
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
HERSELF.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY SIGN OF

1010
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
THAT NUMBER TWO, PRESIDENT

1011
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
OBAMA SHOULD BE INVOLVED WE

1012
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
HAVEN'T SEEN ANY SIGN OF THAT

1013
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
NUMBER THREE, THE NEW MEXICAN

1014
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
PRESIDENT, THERE IS NO WAY

1015
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
THAT THIS GUY SHOULDN'T LET

1016
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
THIS MARINE OUT TOMORROW.

1017
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
CHRISTMAS IS COMING UP.

1018
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
WE CALLED THE MEXICAN EMBASSY

1019
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
TODAY.
THOSE PEOPLE ARE TOTALLY

1020
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
CHAOTIC.
>> THEY ARE VERY BUSY.

1021
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
>> THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

1022
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
HELL IS GOING ON.

1023
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
THEY DON'T CARE.
SO I THINK NOW WE ARE GOING TO

1024
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
HAVE TO SQUEEZE.

1025
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
WE WILL HAVE TO PUT PRESSURE.

1026
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
>> HERE IS THE IRONY.

1027
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
LET THE VIEWERS KNOW.

1028
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
SO WE HAVE THIS 1.9

1029
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
BILLION-DOLLAR ASSISTANCE
PROGRAM THAT WE HELP MEXICO

1030
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
WITH TO FIGHT THEIR WAR ON

1031
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
DRUGS, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

1032
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
WE HAVE BEEN SENDING DOWN

1033
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
MONEY FOR BLACKHAWK

1034
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
HELICOPTERS AND SO ON.

1035
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
RECENTLY OUR EFFORT HAS

1036
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
SHIFTED TO MORE OF A LAW AND

1037
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
ORDER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

1038
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
AND WE HAVE HAD THE FORMER

1039
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
DIRECTOR OF COLORADO'S

1040
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
PENITENTIARY SYSTEM HAS

1041
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
TRAINED MORE THAN 5,000

1042
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
MEXICAN PRISON OFFICIALS IN

1043
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
RECENT YEARS.

1044
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
MEXICAN JURY LISTS RUNNING

1045
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
MOCK TRIALS WITH VISITING

1046
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
MEASURE JUDGES WHAT ARE THEY

1047
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
TRAINING FOR?

1048
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
TO TRY OUR MARINE.

1049
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

1050
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
GOING DOWN THERE TO REVAMP OUR

1051
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
LAW AND ORDER SYSTEM AND WHO

1052
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
ARE THEY GOING TO USE IT

1053
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
AGAINST NOT THEIR OWN CARTEL

1054
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
MEMBERS BUT OUR MILITARY.

1055
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
>> Bill: GOING TO BE ON
HANNITY AFTER OUR PROGRAM

1056
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
STICK AROUND.

1057
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
WE WILL DO A STORY ON IT

1058
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
TOMORROW.
MEXICAN EMBASSY, AGAIN WE

1059
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
ASKED YOU ALL DAY LONG TO

1060
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
COMMENT.

1061
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
YOU ARE HIDING.
YOU CAN'T CONTINUE TO HIDE.

1062
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
HILLARY CLINTON, YOU KNOW

1063
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
WHAT?
YOU HAVE GOT TO GET INVOLVED.

1064
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
ALL RIGHT, MS. SECRETARY?

1065
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
YOU HAVE GOT TO GET INVOLVED.

1066
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
THAT'S IT.

1067
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
AND IF PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TO
GET INVOLVED, HE HAS TO GET

1068
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
INVOLVED.
THIS IS A MARINE CORPS PATROL.

1069
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
THIS IS AN AMERICAN FOUR

1070
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
MONTHS FOR NOTHING.

1071
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
>> HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

1072
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
WRONG.

1073
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
>> Bill: THAT'S IT.
>> HE IS FACING UP TO 12 YEARS

1074
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
IN PRISON.

1075
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
ESSENTIALLY.
>> Bill: IS HE GOING TO GET

1076
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
OUT SOON.
I HAVE CONFIDENCE THE NEW

1077
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
PRESIDENT OF MEXICO IS GOING

1078
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

1079
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
>> THEY ARE CALLING THE

1080
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
PARENTS FROM THE JAIL AND
TRIED TO EXTORT THOUSANDS OF

1081
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
DOLLARS.

1082
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
>> Bill: OF COURSE, THAT'S
WHAT THEY DO.

1083
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
>> HAD TO MOVE TO SOLITARY

1084
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
CONFINEMENT.

1085
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
THEY SAY HE HAS BEEN CHAINED

1086
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
TO THE BED.

1087
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
APPARENTLY WE WERE ABLE TO

1088
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING.

1089
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
>> Bill: ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

1090
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
SENATOR BOB MENENDEZ FROM NEW

1091
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
JERSEY APPARENTLY HAD AN

1092
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
IMMIGRANT WHO WAS IN THE

1093
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
COUNTRY, AN INTERN IN THE

1094
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, ALL RIGHT?

1095
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
>> RIGHT.

1096
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
>> Bill: AND A REGISTERED SEX

1097
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
OFFENDER TO BOOT.

1098
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
PICK IT UP.

1099
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
>> WELL, THEN, THAT INTERN

1100
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
JUST GOT ARRESTED.
IS HE ONLY A YOUNG KID.

1101
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
IS HE 18 YEARS OLD.

1102
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
HE GOT ARRESTED.

1103
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
SEX CHARGE IS AGAINST HIM?

1104
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
BECAUSE IT WAS SEALED?

1105
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
>> JUVY REGISTER AS A SEX

1106
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
OFFENDER.

1107
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I'M CONFUSED ABOUT THIS CASE

00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
>> WE'RE AT 16 TRILLION.

1289
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
YOU JUST DOUBLED IT.

1290
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
ARE YOU A FACTOR FAN BY ANY

1291
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
CHANCE?
>> I LOVE YOU.

1292
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> AND I LOVE HIM.

1293
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
BUT I'M TOO CHEAP FOR CABLE.

1294
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
>> HOW ARE YOU?

1295
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I WATCH YOU ALMOST EVERY DAY.

1296
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
>> I DON'T AGREE WITH A LOT OF

1297
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
HIS COMMENTARY.
>> REALLY?

1298
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
WHAT SPECIFICALLY?
>> I HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE

1299
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
COUNTRY FOR TWO YEARS.

1300
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I'M NOT A GOOD PERSON TO ACT.

1301
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
>> LET ME GUESS YOU LIVE IN

1302
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
FRANCE.
>> HOW DID YOU KNOW?

1303
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
>> OH, NAILED IT.

1304
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
>> Bill: SO YOU ARE ROAMING

1305
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
AROUND DC I ALWAYS ASK THIS

1306
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
QUESTION BUT IT'S INTERESTING
TO ME.

1307
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
YOU TALK TO, WHAT, A COUPLE OF

1308
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
DOZEN PEOPLE.
>> ABOUT TWO DOZEN.

1309
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
SO, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THEM

1310
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
HAD ANY CLUE AT ALL WHAT'S AT

1311
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
STAKE HERE?

1312
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
>> I SAY HALF OF THEM CLUELESS

1313
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
ON THE CLIFF.

1314
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
>> HALF OF THEM NO IDEA.

1315
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
>> IT'S BORING.

1316
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT

1317
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
THEY DO THIS MAN WHO CRIED

1318
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
WOLF ALL THE TIME.

1319
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
THEY HAVE THESE CLIFFS WITH

1320
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
THE DEBT CEILING WITH THE BUSH

1321
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
TAX CUSS.
PEOPLE ARE NUMB TO THIS.

1322
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
THEY DO THIS EVERY CHRISTMAS.

1323
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
THEY DON'T CARE.

1324
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
>> LOOK, NUMBER ONE WHEN YOU

1325
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
SAY 16 TRILLION-DOLLAR DEBT IT

1326
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO

1327
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
ANYBODY.

1328
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
>> YOU CAN'T WRAP YOUR HEAD

1329
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
AROUND THAT.

1330
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
>> Bill: MAKE YOUR CAR PAYMENT
TAKE YOUR CAR AWAY THEY KNOW.

1331
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
NUMBER TWO, IT'S A PRETTY

1332
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
COMPLICATED SITUATION.
IT'S NOT JUST RAISING THE

1333
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
TAXES ON WEALTHY AND

1334
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
CORPORATIONS.

1335
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
IT'S A LOT OF OTHER STUFF
INVOLVED IN IT AS WELL.

1336
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
BUT, OUT OF THE TWO DOZEN

1337
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
PEOPLE, WERE THERE ANYBODY --

1338
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
WAS THERE ONE PERSON WHO

1339
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
REALLY HAD A HANDLE ON IT?

1340
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
>> WELL, WE RAN INTO AN ACTUAL

1341
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
PERSON WHO WORKS FOR A

1342
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
SENATOR.

1343
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
AND THAT WAS -- THAT MADE THE

1344
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
PACKAGE BECAUSE, WITHOUT HER,

1345
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
NO ONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT'S

1346
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
GOING ON.

1347
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
>> Bill: SO ONE OUT OF 24.

1348
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
>> ONE OUT OF 20 NAILED IT.

1349
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
FACTOR FAN AND SAID SHE LOVED

1350
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
ME.
>> Bill: YOU CAN'T HAVE

1351
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
EVERYTHING.

1352
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
JESSE WATTERS, EVERYBODY,
THERE HE IS.

1353
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
IS HE GOING TO HAWAII.

1354
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
WATTERS IS GOING TO HAWAII

1355
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS

1356
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
VACATIONING THERE I'M SURE THE

1357
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO INVITE

1358
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
YOU.
YOU WILL BE OUT AND WACKY

1359
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
TOGETHER.
>> ALOHA.

1360
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
>> FACTOR TIP OF THE DAY

1361
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
HISTORIC OCCURRENCE IN THE
BOOK WORLD THAT YOU SHOULD

1362
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
KNOW ABOUT.

1363
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,000
THE TIP 60 SECONDS AWAY.

1364
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
>> FACTOR TIP OF THE DAY.

1365
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
IT IS AN AMAZING SITUATION.

1366
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
TAKE A LOOK AT THE FULL-PAGE AD

1367
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
IN THE NEW YORK TIMES,

1368
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
CELEBRATING THE FACT THAT

1369
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
"KILLING KENNEDY" IS THE

1370
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
NUMBER-1 SELLING BOOK.

1371
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
"KILLING LINCOLN," NUMBER 2,

1372
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
AFTER 60 WEEKS IN THE

1373
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
MARKETPLACE.
THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE,

1374
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
AS FAR AS WE KNOW.

1375
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
THE "KILLING KEN DE" AUDIOBOOK.

1376
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000

1377
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
INCREDIBLE.

1378
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
THANK YOU ALL.

1379
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,000

00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR IT.

1382
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
>> I WANT IT HEAR THE OPPOSING

1383
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
POINTS OF VIEW, BILL.

1384
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
IT'S BORING TO JUST HEAR ONE

1385
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
SIDE, WHICH IS WHY WE MAINTAIN

1386
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
OUR NUMBER-1 STATUS ON THE

1387
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000

WE EMBRACE BOTH SIDES OF THE

1388
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
DEBATE.
