I'VE GOT TWO BANDS HERE.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I WAS SHOCKED HERE.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
QUITE SO MUCH RESISTANCE.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
IT'S A GOOD WORKOUT,
I LIFT A LOT AND BELIEVE ME.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
IT STARTED SHAKING.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
OBVIOUSLY STRONG AND THIS
IS MAKING YOU WORKOUT.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
AND THIS IS TWO BANDS, AND

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
THERE IS UP TO FIVE THERE
SO IT CAN CHALLENGE YOU.

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
THIS IS KIND OF AN ALL IN ONE

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
SOLUTION AND IF I GO ON A
ROAD TRIP I THROW IT IN MY CAR.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
IT'S A PERFECT WAY TO
MAKE SURE YOU DON'T

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
SKIP YOUR WORKOUTS.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
FOR THE REALLY ADVENTUROUS

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
PERSON ON YOUR LIST HOW
ABOUT A PAIR OF KANGAROO JUMPS.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
THESE LOOK LIKE
SKY BOOTS RIGHT.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
YOUR FOOT IS IN THERE
NICE AND FIRM AND TIGHT.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
AND I'M GOING TO
BE OKAY IN THEM.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
TOTALLY IF YOU CAN STAND
UP STRAIGHT YOU'RE GOOD.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
THIS IS ALL ABOUT

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
HAVING FUN WHILE
WERE WORKING OUT.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
IT'S A GREAT EXERCISE

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
FOR ANYONE NINE YEARS

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
TO NINETY YEARS.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
SO IT ABSORBS THE IMPACT,

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
BUILDS BONE DENSITY AND
YOU BURN TONS OF CALORIES.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I TEACH AEROBICS IN
THEM, SO I LITERALLY

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
DO AEROBIC TYPE STEPS.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
REMEMBER THE DAY'S RIGHT.

WORKING YOUR MUSCLES ON

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
THE INSIDE OF YOUR BODY.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000

WANT AIR BUBBLE IN IT.

168
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

169
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE ABOUT

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
COOKING WITH YOU IS WERE
ALWAYS BAKING SOMETHING

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
AND I THINK BAKING AND I
THINK CALORIES YOU CAN'T

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
HAVE BAKED GOODS

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
CONSCIOUS, BUT YOU CAN YOU
JUST HAVE TO DO IT RIGHT.

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
AND BE CREATIVE, I SAID
THE AMOUNT OF CALORIES YOU

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
HAVE IN THE SUGAR,

177
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
AND THIS IS WHOLE WHEAT DOUGH

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
AND WE PUT SOME SUGAR, BECAUSE

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
THEY ARE CINNAMON SUGAR PRETZELS

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
BUT WE USE COCONUT SUGAR,

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

182
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
THEY'RE 12 INCHES OR LONGER

183
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
AND THEY STAY 12 INCHES.

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
YOU LINK THEM
TOGETHER AT ONE END

185
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
AND TWIRL IT TOGETHER.

186
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
LIKE SO.

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
YOU WANT LOTS
OF TWIRLS IN IT.

188
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
AS TIGHTLY AS POSSIBLE

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
THEY LOOK COOLER.

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
THAT WOULD BE
YOUR CANDY CANE.

191
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THE NEXT STEP IS WE

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
HAVE BOILING WATER
WE'RE PUTTING BAKING SODA IN.

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
SO NOW OUR GOAL HERE, THIS
IS THE TRICKY PART IS

194
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
GETTING THESE TO STAY

195
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
IN THIS SHAPE AS
THEY'RE FORMING.

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
SO WHAT I DO, YOU CAN USE

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
A STEAMER IF YOU HAVE ONE

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
OR USE A SPATULA OR SOMETHING

199
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
LIKE THIS AND I SPRAY IT
WITH SPRAY AND THEN

200
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I LAY MY CANDY CANE ON THERE.

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
OKAY.

202
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
SO NOW WE HOPE IT GOES IN

203
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
THE WATER, AND YOU WANT
TO MAKE SURE YOU GET IT.

204
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
SEE HOW IT'S LIKE
GOING AWAY BUT IF YOU

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
GENTLY GUIDE IT HERE.

206
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
OKAY.

207
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
SO AND THEN IT WILL FORM

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
AND STAY LIKE THAT.

209
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
AND THEN YOU SIMPLY WAIT
FOR IT TO POP TO THE TOP.

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'M SO EXCITED
TO TAKE THESE.

211
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
YAY.

212
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000

DESSERT COOK BOOK.

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
SO NOW IT'S FORMED AND
AGAIN GENTLY TAKE IT OUT.

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
IT'S GOING TO KEEP SHAPE
THOUGH, YOU CAN SEE NOW.

218
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
AND THEN YOU PUT
IT ON A PARCHMENT

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
LINE BAKING SHEET.

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
AND THEN YOU HAVE

233
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
TWO GRAMS OF FAT AND FIBER.

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
SO FROM HERE WE DO WHAT?

235
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
BAKE THEM IN THE OVEN 450

236
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
DEGREES FOR TEN MINUTES.

237
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
TEN MINUTES THAT'S IT?

238
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
10-12 YEAH.

239
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
SO ONCE THEY'RE OUT OF THE

240
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
OVEN YOU WANT TO LET THEM

241
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
COOL FOR A COUPLE MINUTES.

242
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE PRETZELS

243
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
YOU WANT THEM TO BE HOT, BUT

244
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
NOT SO HOT YOU BURN YOURSELF.

245
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
SO MIX THE SUGAR HERE.

246
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
CINNAMON IS LIKE ONE OF
MY MOST FAVORITE THINGS.

247
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I LOVE CINNAMON.

248
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
ANYTHING CINNAMON.

249
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
SO NOW THIS IS

250
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
THE SUBSTITUTE.

251
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
SO BRUSH THE

252
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
PRETZELS VERY WELL.

253
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
GET THE NOOKS
AND CRANNIES.

254
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
AND THEN LITERALLY
DO BOTH SIDES.

255
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
IT'S ALL ABOUT MAKING THE

256
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
STUFF THAT EVERYBODY'S

257
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
USED TO LOOKING AT SO THEY

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
DON'T KNOW IT'S HEALTHY

259
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
AND THEN SPRINKLE OUR
GLITTER AFTER EVERYTHING.

260
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
YES YOU SPRINKLE
THE GLITTER.

261
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I USUALLY PUT THEM
ON A PLATTER FIRST.

262
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
THIS HAS A NICE SHAKER.

263
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
YOU SEE THIS HAS

264
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
A TINY AMOUNT.

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I PUT THEM ON THERE AND

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
THEN SPRINKLED, IT'S
PRETTY AND FESTIVE TO HAVE

267
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
THE SUGAR BITS FALLING.

268
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
AND IT SEEMS
MORE DECADENT.

269
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I CAN TASTE THESE THEN?

270
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
THEY'RE READY TO GO.

271
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'M SO EXCITED.

272
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
WHY DO I GET
EXCITED TO EAT?

273
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
BECAUSE WE ALL DO.

274
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I LOVE BREAD PRETZEL,
I HAVEN'T HAD

275
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
ONE IN LIKE FOREVER.

276
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
SO I CAN MAKE THIS TAKE IT
TO MY HOLIDAY PARTY AND

277
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
THEN I CAN WRAP UP YOUR BOOK.

278
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000

279
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000

AWESOME.

282
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
RUM BALLS HOW
DO WE MAKE THEM.

283
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
THESE ARE REALLY COOL, RUM
BALLS TRADITIONALLY THEY

284
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
HAVE BUTTER, CHOCOLATE,

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
CHOCOLATE BARS.

286
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
SO I USE DATES

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
AS THE BASE.

288
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
WHICH I KNOW MAY NOT SOUND

289
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
VERY GOOD BUT BELIEVE IT
OR NOT YOU'LL NEVER KNOW

290
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
IN THE END
I PROMISE, SO PULSE

291
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
THESE, BREAK THEM UP.

292
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
SEE THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

293
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
WE DON'T HAVE ANY
BIG CHUNKS IN THERE.

294
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
OKAY THEN WERE GOING
TO ADD SOME OATS, WHICH

295
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
HELP BIND THEM TOGETHER.

296
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
COCOA POWDER, INSTEAD OF
CHOCOLATE, YOU GET THE FLAVOR BT

297
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
NOT THE OILS IN CHOCOLATE.

298
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
AND OF COURSE RUM

299
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
THEY ARE RUM BALLS YOU
HAVE TO USE REAL RUM.

300
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
TIS THE SEASON FA LA LA.

301
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
AND THEN WE JUST PULSE

302
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
THESE SOME MORE AND IT WILL BE
NICE AND STICKY AND GOOEY.

303
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
OOO IT SMELLS GOOD, IT
SMELLS LIKE CHOCOLATE.

304
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
OKAY, ALRIGHT.

305
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
IT SMELLS REALLY GOOD.

306
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
DOESN'T IT?

307
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
YOU CAN REALLY SMELL
THE WAFTING RUN.

308
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
SO ALWAYS OBVIOUSLY TAKE

309
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
YOUR BLADE OUT BEFORE YOU STICK
YOUR HAND IN THE FOOD PROCESSOR.

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
THEY MOST PE.ING ABOUT THIS.

311
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
NOW THESE ARE LITERALLY

312
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
ITS VERY STICKY.

313
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
WHICH IS FINE.

314
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
OKAY.

315
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
YOU CAN SEE IT

316
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
WILL COME TOGETHER.

317
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
IT'S BASICALLY BREAKING
IT IN HALF AND DO

318
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
SEVEN PIECES OUT OF IT.

319
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
BUT IT'S ABOUT THAT.

320
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
SO, DO THIS.

321
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I LOVE HOW ALL
THESE THINGS.

322
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
LIKE THESE ARE.

323
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
LIKE YOUR RECIPES
YOU GET IN THERE YOU

324
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
GIVE IT SOME LOVE.

325
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
ITS YOU KNOW I
CALL IT PLAYING.

326
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
LIKE WE PLAYED IN
THE KITCHEN TODAY.

327
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
LIKE THIS WOULD BE FUN
TO MAKE WITH THE KIDS.

328
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
EXACTLY.

329
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
AND TWO OF THESE WILL ONLY

330
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
BE 155 CALORIES, 4 GRAMS OF
FIBER AND ONLY 2 GRAMS OF FAT.

331
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
SO NOW THERE A LITTLE
STICKY ON THE OUTSIDE AND

332
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
LIKE YOUR TRADITIONAL RUN

333
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
BALL YOU ROLL THEM IN

334

HERE, AND THE SUPER

335
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
IMPORTANT STEP IN HERE IS

336
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
GET THE COCO POWDER OFF,
OTHERWISE WHEN YOU GO TO

337
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
EAT IT YOU MIGHT INHALE

338
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
THE COCOA POWDER.

339
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
WOULD I FIND THIS

340
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
RECIPE AND THE PRETZEL
IN THE SAME COOK BOOK.

341
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
SHAKE OFF MY COCO CAUSE

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
A LITTLE BIT BUT

347
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
ITS ALL GOOD.

348
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
OKAY.

349
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
IT'S GOOD.

350
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
IT IS GOOD.

351
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
IT'S NOT LIKE MY SISTERS.

352
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
A HOUSE BUT I'VE NEVER

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000

00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I LOVE TO GIVE FOOD GIFTS,
THERE IS SO MANY VARIETIES

363
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
FOR INSTANCE I HAVE

364
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
A BOTTLE OF
CHAMPAGNE VINEGAR.

365
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
SO MANY PARTIES YOU BRING
WINE AND YOU DON'T KNOW

366
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
WHAT KIND OF WINE PEOPLE LIKE

367
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
OR IF EVERYBODY DRINKS SO I LIKE

368
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
TO BRING A CHAMPAGNE VINEGAR LIE
A DECADENT PORT VINEGAR.

369
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
OKAY CAUSE YOU CAN PUT IT

370
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
IN A CUTE BAG LIKE THAT

371
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
AND 30 SECONDS AND DONE.

372
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
AND THEN THEY'LL ACTUALLY

373
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
HAVE IT AFTER THE PARTY.

374
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
MANY TIMES IF YOU DO WINE

375
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
YOU DRINK IT DURING THE PARTY

376
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
AND DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU BROUGHT.

377
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
SO ALSO TOO ESPECIALLY WITH YOU

378
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
DO PEOPLE SAY LIKE DEVIN
PLEASE MAKE ME SOMETHING.

379
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
YES PEOPLE WANT ME

380
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
TO BRING SOMETHING.

381
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
SO AGAIN IF YOU'RE TAKING

382
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
SOMETHING TO A PARTY OR
YOU WANT TO GIVE IT AS A GIFT

383
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I SUGGEST MAKING

384
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
GINGERBREAD TRUFFLES.

385
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE
THINGS I LOVE WHEN PEOPLE

386
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
SPEND THE TIME I KNOW

387
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT ME

388
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
WHEN THEY'RE MAKING THE

389
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
GIFT FOR ME SO THIS IS GREAT.

390
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
HOW DO WE MAKE THE

391
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
GINGER BREAD TRUFFLES.

392
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I THINK YOU KNOW THAT
GINGERBREAD MEN, MANY

393
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
PEOPLE WANT THE GINGER BREAD,

394
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
WITH HOLIDAYS

395
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
BUT MOST ARE MADE WITH LARD.

396
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
REALLY?

397
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
YEAH.

398
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
OH.SOMETHING YOU REL

399
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
NOT SOMETHING YOU REALLY
WANT TO BE EATING SO SOME

400
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
CAN BE OBVIOUSLY WITH BUTTER

401
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
BUT TRADITIONALLY WITH LARD.

402
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
SO THE THING IS THE

403
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
MOLASSES AND NICE
SPICES IN THERE.

404
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
SO I'M GONG TO DO SOMETHING

405
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
SIMILAR TO THE RUM BALL BUT SPIE
IT LIKE GINGER BREAD.

406
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
AND AGAIN YOU CAN TELL ME.

407
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
SO START WITH DATES AGAIN.

408
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
DATES ARE GREAT BECAUSE

409
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
THEY GET NICE AND STICKY
AND HOLD THINGS TOGETHER

410
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
BUT STAY MOIST,

411
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
WANT DRY BAKED GOODS.

412
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
OKAY PULSE THEM IN

413
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
YOUR FOOD PROCESSOR.

414
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
AGAIN ANOTHER
REALLY EASY ONE.

415
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
SO WE HAVE OUR DATES

416
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
KIND OF CHOPPED UP.

417
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
ADD OUR MOLASSES.

418
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
THAT'S WHERE I CAN
ALREADY SMELL WHAT'S

419
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
GOING ON IN HERE.

420
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
THIS SMELLS GOOD.

421
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I WISH THAT YOU COULD SEND

422
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
SMELLS THROUGH THE TV.

423
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I KNOW THAT
WOULD BE GREAT.

424
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
SO THEN THE OATS.

425
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
AGAIN.

426
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
YOU'RE NOTICING A PATTERN.

427
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
AND THEN I HAVE A SPICE

428
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
MIXTURE HERE, THESE ARE
INDIVIDUAL SPICES, OF ALL

429
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
SPICE, NUTMEG,
CLOVES AND GINGER.

430
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
WHICH ARE THE

431
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
GINGER BREAD SPICES.

432
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
THEY ARE?

433
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

434
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'VE NEVER MADE COOKIES.

435
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
YOU'VE NEVER MADE A

436
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
GINGER BREAD HOUSE.

437
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'VE DECORATED
A HOUSE BUT I NEVER

438
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
MADE THE GINGER BREAD.

439
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
FROM SCRATCH.

440
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
THIS SMELLS GOOD.'VE GOE

441
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE
GINGER BREAD THING RIGHT.

442
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
SO NOW THIS ONE COMES

443
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
TOGETHER EVEN A LITTLE
MORE THAN THE OTHER ONE.

444
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
AGAIN TAKE THE BLADE
OUT BEFORE YOU DO THIS.

445
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
NEVER REACH AROUND IT

446
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
BECAUSE WITHOUT FAIL

447
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
YOU'LL STAB YOURSELF.

448
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
SO THIS ONE BREAKS

449
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
INTO 12 PIECES.

450
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
SO WELL DO HALF AND

451
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
YOU DO HALF OF THEM.

452
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
SO I NEED SIZE BALLS OUT

453
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
OF THIS AND YOU COULD
PRESS THIS INTO GINGER

454
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
BREAD MEN IF YOU WANT TO.

455
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
HOW LONG CAN I KEEP THESE.

456
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
THESE WILL STAY IN A

457
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
TUPPERWARE FOR A LONG
TIME, I MEAN LIKE A WEEK.

458
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
NOW GRAB SOME OATS
FROM DOWN THERE.

459
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
ALRIGHT.

460
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
OKAY.

461
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
ALRIGHT.

462
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
HERE'S THE OATS AND THEN

463
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
PUT THEM IN THIS BOWL AND
ROLL AWAY AND THE PURPOSE

464
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
OF THIS IS THEY ARE STICKY SO IT

465
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
PUTS OATS ON THE OUTSIDE SO IT

466
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
DOESN'T MAKE IT AS STICKY.

467
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
EXACTLY.

468
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
AND YOU JUST PRESS THESE YOU
WANT TO PRESS IN A LITTLE BIT

469
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
TO MAKE THE OATS STICK.

470
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
TWO OF THESE IS 151

471
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
CALORIES, ONLY A TRACE OF
FAT, LIKE VERY LITTLE BIT,

472
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
AND THEN THREE

473
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
GRAMS OF FIBER.
OKAY.

474
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'M GOING TO TAKE
YOUR BALLS BECAUSE

475
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
YOURS ARE PRETTIER.
THERE YOU GO.

476
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
OKAY.

477
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
SO THEN PUT THEM IN A GIFT

478
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
BOX AND THEN YOU KNOW IF

479
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000

BECAUSE YOU KNOW MY THING.

483
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
IS IT WORTH THE CALORIES.

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

485
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
THAT IS GOOD.

486
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000

487
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
