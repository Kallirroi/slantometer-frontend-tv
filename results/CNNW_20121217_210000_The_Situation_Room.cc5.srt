1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
THAT MATTER.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
YOU KNOW, IF I HAD BEEN ASKED, I

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED IT.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I SUPPORT THE BRADY BAN.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I WAS QUITE ACTIVE WITH MAYORS

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
ON THE GUN ISSUE AT THE TIME

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
THAT THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN WAS

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
EXPIRING.
AND WAS QUITE ACTIVE WITH MAYOR

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
BLOOMBERG ON OTHER ISSUES AROUND

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
GUNS.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'VE BEEN TOLD SOMEONE SUBMITTED

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
THAT.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'M NOT SURE THAT WAS AN

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
ACTIVELY DISCUSSED ITEM.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
WE GET A LOT OF LETTERS IN THE

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
OFFICE.
MOST OF THEM NEVER GET TO ME

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
QUITE FRANKLY.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
SO I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT DIDN'T

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
HAPPEN.
I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
SUPPORTS A PERSON'S OPPORTUNITY

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
TO HUNT.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
AND TO MEET THE STRICTEST

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
DEFINITION OF THE SECOND

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
AMENDMENT, BUT BEYOND THAT I

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
THINK THIS THING HAS GOTTEN WAY

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
OUT OF CONTROL.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
AND THE IDEA THAT ASSAULT

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
WEAPONS ARE AS PLENTIFUL IN THE

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
UNITED STATES WITH A CAPACITY AS

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
LARGE AS THEY'RE AVAILABLE IN

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING IN

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
CONNECTICUT, IS NOT SOMETHING I
SUPPORT.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I THINK THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS AND WEAPONS THAT

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
CAN EASILY BE CONVERTED TO A

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
SALT WEAPONS IS A QUESTION WE

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
REALLY NEED TO HAVE IN THIS

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
COUNTRY.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
OBVIOUSLY THE DISCUSSION CAN

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
BEGIN ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
MAGAZINES, AND I THINK THAT'S A

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
GOOD DISCUSSION TO HAVE.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'D LOVE TO HEAR THE PEOPLE

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
ARGUE THAT WE NEED 30-ROUND

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
MAGAZINES AND THAT'S SOMEHOW

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
TIED TO THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
[ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ]

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
RIGHT, AND THEY SAY THAT BECAUSE

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
THEY KNOW THEY CAN PREVENT

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
ABOUT -- -- I'M NOT TALKING

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
ABOUT BASIC WEAPONS OR WEAPONS

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
USED IN HUNTING.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, IF ANYONE

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
USES AN ASSAULT WEAPON -- AN

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
ASSAULT WEAPON IN THE HUNTING

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
WITH THE 30-ROUND MAGAZINE, I'D

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
BE QUITE SURPRISED BY THAT --

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
AND BY THE WAY, IF THEY DO, AND

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
BECAUSE OF PUBLIC SAFETY, THAT

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
SHOULD GO AWAY, THEN I BELIEVE

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THAT SHOULD GO AWAY.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000

TERM HERE -- WELL, I WAS

67

WONDERING IF YOU AGREE WITH THAT

OBSERVATION AND IF SO, WHY NOW?

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
>> I THINK GUN SAFETY IS -- HAS

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
BEEN IMPORTANT TO OUR

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
ADMINISTRATION AND THE FACT IS

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
WE ARE RANKED AS HAVING THE TOP

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000

THE NATION.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
BUT I WILL GO BACK TO WHAT I

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
SAID EARLIER.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000

DRILL DOWN FURTHER INTO MY OWN

79

PERSONAL HISTORY.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
AS MAYOR OF STANFORD, WE CAME TO

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
UNDERSTAND THAT A BIG PERCENTAGE

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
OF THE HANDGUNS WORK THEIR WAY

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
UP FROM I-95 IN STATES IN WHICH

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THERE ARE ACTUALLY EASIER GUN

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
LAWS AND GUNS IN SOME CASES SOLD

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
UNDER EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE FOR

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
GUN SHOWS.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
THOSE GUNS WORK THEIR WAY UP

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I-95 AND GET TO PLACES LIKE NEW

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
YORK CITY OR CITIES IN OUR STATE

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
AND I'VE ALWAYS SAID THOSE

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
EXCEPTIONS IN THE ABSENCE OF A

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
TOUGHER FEDERAL LEGISLATION IS

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
NOT GOOD FOR CONNECTICUT, NOT

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
GOOD FOR OUR CITIES AND, AGAIN,

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I ALSO HAVE FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
THESE HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
HAVING SAID THAT, BEING IN THE

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
TOP FIVE, I THINK THERE HAVE

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
BEEN PEOPLE WHO PREVIOUSLY

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
THOUGHT THEY'VE DONE ENOUGH IN

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
CONNECTICUT.

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'M NOT SAYING I'M ONE OF THOSE.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I DOUBT THERE IS ONE OF THOSE

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
LEFT.

107

OUT, THAT WE COULD BE COMPLIANT

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000

FROM A 30 MAGAZINE TO A 10

I THINK THAT'S A COMMONSENSE

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT COULD

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
BE TAKEN UP.

ABOUT IT.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
MY COMMENTS ABOUT IT ARE IN

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
LARGE PART BASED ON THE NATURE

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
OF THE CRIME, HOW IT WAS CARRIED

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
OUT, THE FACT THAT HE KILLED HIS

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
MOTHER FIRST, THE FACT THAT HE

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
DROVE HIMSELF TO THE SCHOOL, HE

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000

BUT DO I HAVE A DIAGNOSIS, THE

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
ANSWER'S NO.

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
ILLNESS HAS LONG BEEN DELEGATED

146

TO A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION THAN

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
PHYSICAL HEALTH, FOR INSTANCE.

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
IT IS A DISTINCTION THAT I THINK

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
IN MANY WAYS HAS NOT SERVED OUR

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
COUNTRY WELL.

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000

NOW, OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS,

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000

RECOVER FROM MENTAL ILLNESS, BUT

174

IN FACT, I WANT TO SAY JUST THE

192
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
OPPOSITE.
I'M A BIG BELIEVER THAT A GROUP

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
HOME OR ALTERNATIVE PLACEMENT IS

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A FAR BETTER WAY TO ASSURE

195

POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN TREATING

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
MENTAL ILLNESS, DRUG ADDICTION,

197
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000

LEADERS, BUT THAT'S TENTATIVE.

213
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
THEY'VE NOT SHARED IT WITH THEIR

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
KNOWLEDGE.
IT'S CAPABLE OF BEING ADJUSTED

216
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
FURTHER.
BUT I THINK WE'RE ON A ROAD TO

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
HAVING AN AGREEMENT.

285

286
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
CAN YOU GIVE US SOME DETAIL ON

287
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
THAT --

288
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
>> YEAH, I WAS -- IT WAS EVIDENT

289
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
TO ME THAT THERE WAS A

290
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
RELUCTANCE TO TELL PARENTS AND

291
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
LOVED ONES THAT THE PERSON THEY

292
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
WERE WAITING FOR WAS NOT GOING

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000

294
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
PERIOD OF TIME.

296
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000

297
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000

BE REUNITED.

299
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
SO I MADE A DECISION THAT RATHER

300
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
THAN RELYING ON TRADITIONAL

301
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
INVESTIGATIVE POLICIES, THAT YOU

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
PARTICULAR VICTIM, BEFORE YOU

305
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
INFORM SOMEONE, OR AT LEAST GIVE

306
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
THEM THE INFORMATION BY WHICH

307
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
THEY COULD FORMULATE FOR

308
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
THEMSELVES THAT THEIR LOVED ONE

309
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
WAS NOT GOING TO RETURN, I MADE

310
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
THE DECISION THAT TO HAVE THAT

311
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
GO ON ANY LONGER WAS WRONG.

312
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000

313
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
[ INAUDIBLE ]

314
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000

ALTHOUGH NANCY WAS ABLE TO GET

320
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
DOWN TO NOAH'S WAKE BEFOREHAND,

321
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
SHE THEN WENT UP TO JACK'S

322

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
CNN'S NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT
DEBORAH FEYERICK IS KEEPING

374
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
TRACK OF THE LATEST

375
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
DEVELOPMENTS.
SHE'S JOINING US NOW LIVE WITH

376
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
MORE.
WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING, DEB?

377
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
>> WOLF, WE CAN TELL YOU LAW

378
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
ENFORCEMENT SOURCES ARE TELLING

379
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
US THE COMPUTER IS BEING

380
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
ANALYZED.
IT WAS FOUND SMASHED INSIDE THE

381
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
HOME, AND INVESTIGATORS RIGHT

382
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
NOW GATHERED UP THE PIECE,

383
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
PUTTING IT TOGETHER, TRYING TO

384
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
CHECK ALL THE FORENSICS ON IT,

385
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
WHO HE MAY HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT

386
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
WITH, E-MAILS, WEBSITES.

387
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
ANYTHING THAT MAY GIVE THEM SOME

388
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
INSIGHT INTO WHAT HE WAS

389
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
THINKING IN THE DAYS AND THE

390
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
MOMENTS LEADING UP TO THIS

391
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
CRIME.
WE WANT TO TELL YOU THAT AROUND

392
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
3:00, TWO UNMARKED POLICE CARS

393
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
TRAVELED UP THE LONG DRIVEWAY

394
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
AND YOU CAN SEE, THIS IS AS

395
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
CLOSE AS WE'VE GOTTEN TO THE

396
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
HOME SINCE THIS ALL HAPPENED.

397
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
THREE PEOPLE DID ENTER THAT

398
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
HOME.

399
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
WE BELIEVE THEY'RE

400
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
INVESTIGATORS.
I CAN ALSO TELL YOU, WOLF,

401
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
SOMETHING EQUALLY SAD.

402
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
ON OUR WAY HERE, WE NOTICED

403
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
THERE WERE MARKED SQUAD CARS IN

404
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
THE DRIVEWAYS OF SOME OF THE

405
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
NEARBY HOMES.

406
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY CONNECTICUT

407
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
POLICE THAT ANY HOME DIRECTLY

408
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
AFFECTED BY THIS TRAGEDY WOULD

409
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
HAVE THOSE CARS IN THEIR

410
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
DRIVEWAYS.
SO WE'RE TRYING TO CONFIRM

411
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
WHETHER, IN FACT, THE HOMES

412
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
NEARBY THE LANZAS MAY HAVE BEEN

413
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
AFFECTED.

414
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
CNN CONFIRMED NANCY LANZA, THE

415
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
MOM, WHO WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY

416
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
HER OWN SON, SHOT IN THE HEAD,

417
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
BY HER OWN GUN, THAT, IN FACT,

418
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
SHE HAD CONFIDED TO FRIENDS THAT

419
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
THIS WAS THEIR LAST WINTER HERE,

420
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
THAT THEY WERE PLANNING ON

421
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
MOVING, THAT SHE THOUGHT ABOUT

422
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
POSSIBLY GOING TO WASHINGTON

423
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
STATE, POSSIBLY ENROLLING HER

424
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
SON IN A COLLEGE THERE.

425
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TRACE A

426
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
LITTLE BIT OF HIS ACADEMIC

427
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
HISTORY, WOLF.

428
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
WE CAN TELL YOU, RIGHT NOW,

429
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
THERE IS NO KNOWN CONNECTION TO

430
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

431
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
SCHOOL.
HE FIRST APPEARS IN PUBLIC

432
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
RECORDS AS A FRESHMAN IN HIGH

433
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
SCHOOL BACK IN 2007, AND AT THAT

434
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
TIME, WE SPOKE TO A SECURITY

435
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
DIRECTOR, WHO SAID THAT ADAM

436
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
LANZA IMMEDIATELY WAS IDENTIFIED

437
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
AS A CHILD THAT NEEDED TO BE

438
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
WATCHED.
NOT BECAUSE HE WAS A THREAT TO

439
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
OTHER PEOPLE, THAT HE WAS SO

440
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
GAWKY AND SO AWKWARD THAT

441
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
SECURITY OFFICIALS FELT THAT

442
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
OTHERS MAY BE A THREAT TO HIM.

443
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
SO NOT ONLY DID THEY KEEP AN EYE

444
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
ON HIM, BUT ALSO HE WAS, AT THAT

445
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
TIME, ASSIGNED A SCHOOL

446
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000

447
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
HE LEFT THAT SCHOOL IN ABOUT

448
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
2008.

449
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
HE ENROLLED IN CLASSES AT A

450
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
NEARBY UNIVERSITY, JUST ABOUT 15

451
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
MINUTES FROM HERE.
HE WAS TAKING COMPUTER SCIENCE,

452
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
MACRO ECONOMIC, AMERICAN

453
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000

THIS IS A 16-YEAR-OLD KID, MIND

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
YOU, HE WAS TAKING THOSE

455
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
CLASSES.

456
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
IN 2009, HE JUST FELL OFF THE

457
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
GRID, NEVER WENT BACK TO THE

458
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
SCHOOL.

459
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
HE TOOK UP SHOOTING AS A HOBBY.

460
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
THE ATF TELLING US HE WAS

461
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
SPOTTED AT A LOCAL GUN RANGE.

462
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
EVEN HIS MOM SAYING TO A FRIEND

463
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
THAT IT WAS A HOBBY, THAT HE

464
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
ENJOYED AND HE WANTED TO PURSUE.

465
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
WOLF.
>> DEBORAH FEYERICK, THANKS VERY

PEOPLE ACROSS THE NATION HAVE

467
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
BECOME FASCINATED BY THE STORIES

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
THE MAKESHIFT MEMORIALS THAT ARE

473
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
SPRINGING UP ALL OVER THIS TOWN.

474
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
CNN'S BROOK BALDWIN IS HERE.

475
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
SHE CAUGHT UP WITH A FIRST

BROOK, THE STORY IS POWERFUL.

481
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
IT'S A SYMPTOM, A SYMBOL OF WHAT

482
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
HAS GOING ON HERE.

483
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
YOU AND I HAVE WALKED AROUND

484
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
THIS TOWN.
PEOPLE JUST WANT TO SHOW SOME

485
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
EMOTION.
>> IT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

486
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO TALK TO

487
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
SOME OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS.

488
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
YOU CAN SEE IT IN THEIR EYES

489
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
WHAT THEY SAW BUT THEY DON'T

490
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
EXACTLY WANT TO SHARE IT AND

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000

530
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
>> WE THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OR TWO.

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
SEEING ALL THE CARS, ALL THIS.

535
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
IT'S TOUGH.

536
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
>> SADNESS, ANGER, GUILT IN SOME

545
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
ASPECTS.

546
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
>> WHY GUILT?

547
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000

560
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
>> IT WAS THE SAME FIREHOUSE IN

561
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
WHICH A LOT OF THOSE PARENTS

562
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
WERE WAITING FRIDAY MORNING TO

563
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
FIND OUT THE FATES OF THEIR SONS

564
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000

565
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
TO GET OUT AND HANG THESE 26

566
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
WREATHS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

567
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
TOWN SQUARE AND JUST THOSE TWO

568
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
SIMPLE WORDS, "THANK YOU," YOU

569
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
CAN JUST TELL IT MEANT THE WORLD

570
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
TO THESE GUYS.
>> I JUST MYSELF WALKED UP TO

571
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
THAT FIREHOUSE AND I SAW THOSE

572
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
LITTLE TREES, SAW THE TOYS, THE

573
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
FLOWERS, EVERYTHING --

574
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
>> THE STUFFED ANIMALS --

575
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000

576
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
TIME, A LITTLE TIME WITH SOME OF

577
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS THERE WHO

578
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000

579
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
TO OUR VIEWERS LATER.

580
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
THEY ALL SAID THE SAME THING

581
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
THEY SAID TO YOU.

582
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
THEY NEVER EXPECTED THAT THEY

583
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
WOULD BE -- AND THAT'S SORT OF

584
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
THE COMMAND CENTER.

585
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
IT'S A CRIME SCENE BECAUSE THAT

586
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
FIREHOUSE IS RIGHT DOWN THE

587
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000

588
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000

589
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
AND THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE REVIEW

590
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
EVERYTHING, THEY'RE CHECKING

591
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
EVERYTHING, AND I WAS GOING TO

592
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
MEET WITH ONE OF THE LEAD

593
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
COMMANDERS OVER THERE, BUT THEY

594
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
WERE BUSY RETURNING PERSONAL

595
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
EFFECTS OF SOME OF THOSE WHO

596
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
WERE KILLED TO THEIR PARENTS AND

597
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
JUST --

598
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
>> IT'S A TOUGH SCENE AT THE

599
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
FIREHOUSE.

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000

603
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
EITHER.

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
THAT'S COMPLETELY UP TO THE

737
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
NEWTOWN SCHOOL OFFICIALS.

738
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
THERE'S NO WORD YET IF THEY WANT

739
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
TO START BACK.

740
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
>> THERE WERE ALMOST 600 KIDS IN

741
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
THAT KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FOURTH

742
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
GRADE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HERE

743
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOW A CRIME

744
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
SCENE.
>> THAT'S NOW A CRIME SCENE BUT

745
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
IT'S AMAZING HOW THEY'RE DOING

746
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
EVERYTHING THEY CAN.
YOU CAN SEE IN THOSE TRUCK LOADS

747
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
OF THINGS.
THEY'RE TRYING TO REPLICATE

748
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
ALMOST DOWN TO THE DESK AND THE

749
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
CHAIR AND THE PICTURE ON THE

750
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
WALL, EACH ROOM, AS MUCH AS THEY

751
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
CAN, IN ORDER TO TRY TO GIVE

752
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
THEM A SENSE OF NORMALCY, OF

753
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
SAFETY, OF SOMETHING THAT

754
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
THEY'RE FAMILIAR WITH, TO TRY TO

755
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
GET THEM ON THE PATH TO HEALING.

756
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
BUT THIS FRIDAY IS SUPPOSED TO

757
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
BE THE LAST DAY BEFORE HOLIDAY

758
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
BREAK FOR MANY, FOR I THINK

759
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
EVERY SCHOOL IN THE AREA, SO

760
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
IT'S UP TO -- IF THEY WANT TO

761
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
GET THEM BACK FOR A COUPLE DAYS

762
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
OR AFTER THE HOLIDAY.

763
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
>> THEY GOT TO GET INTO A

764
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
ROUTINE TOO.

765
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I GUESS IT'S GOOD THEY'RE GOING

766
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
TO HAVE THE CHRISTMAS BREAK

767
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
COMING UP SO THEY WON'T -- THAT

768
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
WILL BE NORMAL FOR THEM TO JUST

769
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
SPEND SOME TIME WITH THEIR

770
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
FAMILIES.

771
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
>> WITH THEIR FAMILY.

772
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
WHICH WE KNOW IS IMPORTANT.

773
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
>> KATE WILL BE WITH US

774
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
THROUGHOUT OUR COVERAGE HERE.

775
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
CAN AMERICA PREVENT TRAGEDIES

776
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
LIKE NEWTOWN FROM HAPPENING

777
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
AGAIN?
WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE?

778
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
WE'LL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT

779
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
PARENTS AND COMMUNITIES CAN DO.

780
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
>>> RIGHT HERE IN NEW TOWN, ALL

781
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
THESE MAKESHIFT MEMORIALS ARE

782
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
SPRINGING UP.

783
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
CNN'S DON LEMON IS RIGHT IN THE

784
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
MIDDLE OF ALL OF THIS.

785
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
DON, WALK US THROUGH, EXPLAIN TO

786
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
OUR VIEWERS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
AND WHAT'S GOING ON, BECAUSE

788
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
THIS IS SUCH A POWERFUL AND

789
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
EMOTIONAL PART OF THIS STORY.

790
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
>> POWERFUL IS RIGHT,

791
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
HEARTWARMING, RIGHT.

792
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
WOLF, FLOWERS HERE, TEDDY BEARS,

793
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
CANDLES, SEEMS TO BE THE THEME

794
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
HERE.

795
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
AS YOU AND I WERE TALKING

796
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
YESTERDAY, WHEN I ARRIVED HERE

797
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
ON SATURDAY, IT WAS JUST CANDLES

798
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
HERE.
JUST A SMALL NUMBER OF CANDLES.

799
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
AND NOW THIS HAS GROWN.

800
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
THIS APPEARS TO HAVE BECOME THE

801
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
HEART OF THIS NEWTOWN COMMUNITY,

802
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000

PUTTING UP.

809
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
YOU SEE THIS ORAGAMI HERE, SOME

810
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
PEOPLE CALL THEM JAPANESE BIRDS

811
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
THEY PUT UP FOR BLESSINGS FOR

812
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
EVERYONE INVOLVED.

813
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I WANT TO TALK WITH EMILY AND

814
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I SAW YOU HUGGING AND CRYING.

816
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE.

817
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
>> WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR ABOUT I

00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
NOW.
>> WHY DID YOU WANT TO COME OUT?

820
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
>> LIVED IN NEWTOWN MY WHOLE

821
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
LIFE.

822
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I USED TO GO TO SANDY HOOK TILL

823
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I WAS 7.

824
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
YOU COULD WALK ANYWHERE, FEEL

825
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
OKAY.
SUCH A GREAT COMMUNITY.

826
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
WE'RE JUST -- I'M JUST PROUD OF

827
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000

REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

832
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
>> YOU'VE BEEN VERY EMOTIONAL AS

833
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
WELL.

834
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
>> SAME THING, I'VE LIVED HERE

835
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

836
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
MY KARATE SCHOOL'S RIGHT AROUND

837
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
THE CORNER.

838
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
IT'S MY SECOND HOME.

839
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I LOOK ON TV LIKE ALL THIS STUFF

840
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
AND I -- IT'S NOT MY HOME

841
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
ANYMORE, LIKE, IT'S NOT THE

842
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
SAME.

843
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
>> WOLF, PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY

844
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
DON'T WANT TO -- THANK YOU,

845
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
LADIES, THANK YOU.

846
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT YOU.

847
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
THEY DON'T WANT THIS TO BE WHAT

848
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
THEIR TOWN IS REMEMBERED FOR.

849
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
BUT, AGAIN, IF YOU LOOK AT THIS,

850
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
IT'S EVEN GOING FURTHER DOWN THE

851
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
STREET.
AT FIRST, IT WAS JUST IN THE

852
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
MIDDLE OF THE SQUARE WHERE THEY

853
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
HAVE THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND NOW

854
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
IT IS -- THERE ARE TEDDY BEARS

855
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
UPON TEDDY BEARS, FLOWERS UPON

856
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
FLOWERS, AND LAYERS UPON LAYERS

857
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE

858
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
DROPPING OFF AND NOTES SAYING

859

861
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000

THIS IS WHERE PEEP COME OUT AND

THEY POUR THEIR LOVE AND THEIR

864
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
WORDS.
WE'VE EVEN SEEN PEOPLE PRAYING

865
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
OPENLY OUT HERE AND EMBRACING

866
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
AND PEOPLE DROPPING OFF FLOWERS

867
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
ALL DAY.
NOT JUST SINGLE FLOWERS, WOLF.

868
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE --

869
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
EXPENSIVE ARRANGEMENTS THEY'VE

870
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
BROUGHT HERE, POINSETTIAS,

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000

00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
THEY'RE FEELING.

874
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
AS WE HAVE BEEN SEEING THE WHO

875
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
TIME, TO A PERSON, THEY SAY, I

876
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
DON'T WANT TO FEEL HELPLESS.

877
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I WANT TO COME OUT AND I WANT TO

878
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
SUPPORT MY COMMUNITY.

879
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
>> ONE OF THE SADDEST THINGS IS

880
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
TO SEE THE NOTES THAT LITTLE

881
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000

923
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
HE WAS A CUB SCOUT WHO PLAYED

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
BASEBALL, ENJOYED THE KIDS

925
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
WORKSHOP AT THE HOME DEPOT AS

00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
WELL, 7 YEARS OLD.

927

INJO

928
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
INJOINING US NOW, DR. DREW

929
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
PINSKE.
THANKS SO MUCH.

930
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
HOW IMPORTANT IS IT FIRST OF ALL

931
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
FOR THESE OTHER KIDS, NEARLY 600

932
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
OF THEM, TO GET BACK INTO A

933
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
REGULAR SCHOOL ROUTINE?

934
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
>> IT'S VERY IMPORTANT, WOLF,

935
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
THAT THESE PARENTS TELL THEIR

936
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
KIDS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

937
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
SAFE AND THEY NEED TO GET BACK

938
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
TO THEIR LIVES.

939
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
IMPORTANT TO GIVE SORROW AND

940
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
TRAUMA WORDS, ALLOW THE KIDS TO

941
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS AND MAKE

942
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
SENSE OF THEM.

943
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF

944
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
US, THE HEAD OF EVERY HOUSEHOLD,

945
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
THE HEAD OF EITHER COMMUNITY, TO

946
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
BEGIN TALKING ABOUT HEALING,

947
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
RETURNING TO A NORMAL LIFE, AND

948
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
AN UNDERSTANDING THAT ALTHOUGH

949
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
WE WILL NOT FORGET THIS, WE'RE

950
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
GOING TO BE OKAY, WE ARE

951
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
RESILIENT AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO

952
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
LET THIS HAPPEN TO OUR KIDS

953
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
AGAIN.
>> I KNOW YOU HEARD THE

954
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT.

955
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF OTHER

956
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
POLITICIANS SPEAKING OUT RIGHT

957
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
NOW.
YOU'VE GOT SOME STRONG VIEWS.

958
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO NOW AS A

959
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
COUNTRY TO TRY TO PREVENT THESE

960
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
KIND TRAGEDIES?

961
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
>> WE'RE LOOKING FOR LEADERSHIP.

962
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
ONE THING WE DO IN THE

963
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL WHEN WE'RE

964
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
DEALING WITH VERY DISTURBED

965
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
PEOPLE IS WE FORM A TEAM THAT IS

966
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
A HEALTHY FAMILY.

967
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
WE MODEL A HEALTHY FAMILY.

968
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
AND WE HAVE A UNIFIED FRONT SO

969
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
THERE'S NO SPLITTING OF THAT

970
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
FRONT.

971
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
AND I CALL UPON OUR LEADERS AT

972
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
COMMUNITY, AT STATE, AND AT

973
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
FEDERAL LEVEL, TO MODEL A

974
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
HEALTHY FAMILY.

975
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
DIVISIVENESS AND SPLITTING IS

976
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
WHAT CAUSES THE MOST VULNERABLE

977
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
AMONGST US TO FEEL LIKE ACTING

978
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
OUT.
IT CREATES A VULNERABILITY TO

979
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
THESE KINDS OF THINGS.

980
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
TWO OTHER THINGS I WOULD SAY.

981
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
ONE IS PHYSICIANS MUST BE ABLE

982
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
TO DO THEIR JOB.

983
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
IF THEY HAVE AN INSTINK

984
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
SOMEBODY'S IN TROUBLE, THEY MUST

985
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
BE ABLE TO ACT ON THAT INSTINCT

986
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
DESPITE THE CONCERN FOR

987
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
SOMEBODY'S RIGHT, THE INSTINCT

988
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
IS TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL AND

989
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
THE COMMUNITY FOR THEIR OWN

990
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
GOOD.
DOCTORS MUST BE ABLE TO DO THEIR

991
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
JOB.

992
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
NUMBER TWO, BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH

993
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
WOU

994
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
WOEFUL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES,

995
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS BECOME THE
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OF LAST

996
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
RESORT.

997
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
WE MUST CALL UPON THEM.

998
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I'M NOT ASKING WE FLOOD THE LAW

999
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM.

1000
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
BUT I CANNOT TELL YOU, WOLF, HOW

1001
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
OFTEN I'M TELLING PARENTS AND

1002
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
FAMILY MEMBERS TO JUST CALL LAW

1003
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE IT'S ALL WE

1004
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
GOT AND YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING

1005
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
TO DO THAT OR SOMETHING HORRIBLE

1006
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
LIKE THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.

1007
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
>> BECAUSE WE REALLY DO KEEP

1008
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AT A

1009
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
DIFFERENT LEVEL THAN PHYSICAL

1010
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
AILMENTS OUT THERE --

1011
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> IT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM

1012
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
HERE, ISN'T IT?
WE'VE GOT TO DO A LOT MORE --

1013
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1014
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
>> -- TO EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT

1015
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
MENTAL HEALTH.
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1016
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY

1017
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
THE PROBLEMS AND THEN DOCTORS --

1018
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I WAS TALKING TO DR. OZ THIS

1019
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
MORNING, SAYING, LOOK, YOU, IN

1020
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
THE MIDDLE OF AN OPERATION, IF

1021
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
SOMETHING GOES WRONG, COULD

1022
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
IMPROVISE AND USE YOUR JUDGMENT.

1023
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
IN MENTAL HEALTH, WE CAN'T DO

1024
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
THAT.
ALL KINDS OF THINGS GET IN THE

1025
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
WAY OF PHYSICIANS DOING THEIR

1026
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
JOB.
BY THE SAME TOKEN, BECAUSE WE'RE

1027
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
SO UNDERSERVED IN MENTAL HEALTH,

1028
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
WE GOT NOTHING MUCH ELSE AT OUR

1029
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
DISPOSAL BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT.

1030
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
OF COURSE FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND

1031
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
COMMUNITIES DON'T LIKE TO DO

1032
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
THAT, BUT THEY'RE THERE TO HELP.

1033
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
PHYSICIANS ARE THERE TO HELP.

1034
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THERE TO

1035
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
HELP.

1036
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
BUT BEYOND THAT, I REALLY

1037
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
STRONGLY CALL UPON OUR LEADERS

1038
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
TO, A, LET OUR CHILDREN KNOW

1039
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
TODAY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

1040
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
FINE, AND, B, WE'RE GOING TO BE

1041
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
A HEALTHY FAMILY, THAT WE ARE

1042
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
COMMITTED TO AND WE'RE NOT GOING

1043
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
TO SEE ALL THESE DIVISIVENESS

1044
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
AND ENVY AND HATRED WHICH IS

1045
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
REALLY -- ALONGSIDE OF ME WE'RE

1046
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
LOOKING AT LOVE AND GRACE WHICH

1047
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
IS THE RESPONSE TO THE ENVY AND

1048
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
HATRED THAT RESULTED IN THE EVIL

1049
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THAT POOR

1050
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
TOWN.
>> WHERE DO YOU COME DOWN,

1051
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
DR. DREW, ON THE ISSUE OF

1052
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES, VIOLENT

1053
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
FILMS AND LITTLE BOYS?

1054
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
>> WELL, I MUST TELL YOU, WOLF,

1055
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I'VE GOT VERY STRONG FEELINGS

1056
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
ABOUT THIS.

1057
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
TWOFOLD.

1058
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
ONE IS WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT A

1059
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
GOOD THING.
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT NOT

1060
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
BEING GOOD FOR KIDS.

1061
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE KIDS.

1062
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
REMEMBER, HERE, WE HAVE A YOUNG

1063
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
MAN WHO WENT OUT AND WAS

1064
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
SHOOTING GUNS SO THERE -- HE'S

1065
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
GONE TO THE NEXT LEVEL WITH

1066
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
THE -- YOU KNOW, FROM A TOY GUN

1067
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
OR A VIDEO GAME TO SHOOTING

1068
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
GUNS.
BUT OF GRAVER CONCERN, THIS HAS

1069
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
NOT BEEN STUDIED YET, IS THAT

1070
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
PEOPLE TODAY FEEL ENTITLED TO

1071
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
ACT OUT ON REAL PEOPLE IN SOCIAL

1072
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
MEDIA.

1073
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
THE KIND OF VENOM AND HATRED

1074
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
THAT IS EXPRESSED TOWARDS ACTUAL

1075
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE IT AND READ

1076
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
IT AND THE ENTITLEMENT YOUNG

1077
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO ACT THAT OUT IN

1078
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
SOCIAL MEDIA, I THINK THAT IS

1079
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
WHERE THE DISASSOCIATION COMES

1080
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
AND THE DISCONNECT THAT ALLOWS

1081
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
PEOPLE TO LOSE EMPATHY THAT CAN

1082
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
RESULT IN SOMETHING HORRIBLE

1083
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
LIKE THIS.

1084
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
>> WHY IS IT ALWAYS -- IT SEEMS

1085
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
TO BE ALMOST ALWAYS YOUNG MEN OR

1086
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
BOYS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THESE

1087
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
KINDS OF MASS MURDERS AS OPPOSED

1088
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
TO GIRLS OR YOUNG WOMEN.

1089
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
>> YEAH.

1090
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
WELL, THE REASON IS THAT'S MEN,

1091
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
NUMBER ONE, I MEAN, THAT IS

1092
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
SIMPLY THE FACT, MEN ARE MORE

1093
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
LIKELY TO ACT OUT VIOLENTLY.

1094
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
18 TO 25 IS THE WINDOW WHEN

1095
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
MAJOR MENTAL ILLNESS EMERGES.

1096
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
THINGS LIKE SCHIZOPHRENIA,

1097
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000

1100
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
THAT'S THE WINDOW WHEN THIS

1101
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
COMES ON.

1102
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
THOSE KIDS WHO HAVE INTERVENTION

1103
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
DURING THAT WINDOW ARE LESS

1104
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
LIKELY TO HAVE THE CHRONIC

00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
LONG-TERM PROBLEMS.

1106
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
BUT IF YOU DON'T INTERVENE THEN,

1107
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
YOU'RE LIKELY TO HAVE SOMEONE

1108
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
WHO PROGRESSES AND WORSENS AND

1109
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
WHO HAS A LIFETIME OF PROBLEMS.

1140
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
but with ADVAIR,
I'm breathing better.

1141
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So now I can be in
the scene.

1142
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
ADVAIR is
clinically proven to help

1143
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
significantly improve

1144
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
lung function.

1145
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Unlike most COPD medications,

1146
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
ADVAIR contains both an
anti-inflammatory

1147
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
and a
long-acting bronchodilator

1148
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
working together to help improve
your lung function all day.

1149
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
ADVAIR won't
replace fast-acting inhalers

1150
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
for sudden symptoms

1151
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
and should not be used more
than twice a day.

1152
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
People with
COPD taking ADVAIR

1153
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
may have a higher chance
of pneumonia.

1154
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
ADVAIR may increase your
risk of osteoporosis

1155
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
and some eye problems.

1156
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Tell your doctor
if you have a heart condition

1157
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
or high blood pressure before
taking ADVAIR.

1158
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
If you're still
having difficulty breathing,

1159
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
ask your doctor if including
ADVAIR could help

1160
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
improve your lung function.

SO MANY FUNERALS TO COME FOR THE

6-YEAR-OLD NOAH POZNER AND JACK

JOINING US NOW IS THE FORMER

00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION.

1172
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
THIS MUST BE SO DIFFICULT FOR

1173
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
YOU.

1174
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
YOU KNEW SOME OF THESE PEOPLE

1175
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
WHO WERE KILLED.

1176
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

1177
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
>> GOING THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE

1178
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
YOU MEAN?

1179
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
OH, IT'S BEEN HORRIFIC.

1180
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
FROM THE MOMENT WE ALL HEARD THE

1181
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
NEWS, IT WAS DEVASTATING TO KNOW

1182
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
THAT SOMEONE HAD COME INTO THE

1183
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
SCHOOL WITH A GUN, THAT ALONE

1184
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
WAS HORRIBLE ENOUGH BECAUSE IT'S

1185
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
A PLACE OF PEACE AND JOY.

1186
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
BUT NOW AS WE GO FORWARD AND

1187
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
WE'VE LEARNED THE NAMES AND NOW

1188
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE GRUELING

1189
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
PROCESS OF THE FUNERALS, IT'S

1190
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
VERY, VERY, VERY HARD.

1191
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
EVERYONE USES THE WORD "HOLLOW."

1192
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT NOW.

1193
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
>> I CERTAINLY WANT TO RESPECT

1194
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
THE PRIVACY OF THE PARENTS AND

1195
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
FAMILIES OF THE TWO LITTLE BOYS

1196
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
WHO WERE BURIED TODAY.

1197
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE -- YOU WERE

1198
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
THERE, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT

1199
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
IT TO EVEN TELL US WHAT WAS

1200
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
GOING ON.

1201
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
>> I DON'T.
I DON'T WANT TO SAY WHICH ONE I

1202
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
WENT TO EITHER.

1203
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY.

1204
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
>> BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE GRIEF

1205
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
WAS OVERWHELMING IN THE PARKING

1206
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
LOT AFTERWARDS FROM THOSE OF US

1207
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
WHO HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER YET

1208
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
DURING THIS.

1209
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
SO IT'S EVERYTHING YOU CAN

1210
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
IMAGINE PLUS SOME.

1211
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
IT'S WORSE.

1212
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
>> HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD?

1213
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
HOW DOES THIS COMMUNITY MOVE

1214
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
FORWARD?
BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF YOUR

1215
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
RESPONSIBILITIES.
>> YES.

1216
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I FEEL LIKE I SAID BEFORE THAT

1217
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
WE REALLY NEED TO LEAD WITH

1218
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
LOVE.

1219
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M SEEING OUR

1220
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
COMMUNITY DO.

1221
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
WE'RE PUTTING OUR ARMS AROUND

1222
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
PEOPLE.
BUT THERE'S ALSO THE

1223
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
RESPONSIBILITY THAT AS WE START

1224
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT ARE

1225
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
WE GOING TO DO NEXT AND I'M

1226
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
SEEING SOME OF THIS ONLINE WHERE

1227
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
PEOPLE ARE ALREADY STARTED TO

1228
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
YELL AT EACH OTHER.

1229
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IF

1230
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THESE

1231
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
BROADER DISCUSSIONS ON ALL THE

1232
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
ISSUES, NOT JUST GUN CONTROL,

1233
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
MENTAL HEALTH, ALL THE OTHER

1234
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
ISSUES, SCHOOL SAFETY, THEN WE

1235
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
CAN'T YELL AT EACH OTHER.

1236
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
THAT'S ALL WE'VE BEEN DOING IN

1237
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
THIS COUNTRY, IT'S SO DIVISIVE.

1238
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
>> HOW DO WE GET OVER THAT?

1239
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
PEOPLE ARE SO PASSIONATE ON AN

1240
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
ISSUE LIKE GUN CONTROL.

1241
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
>> FIRST, WE'VE GOT TO LEARN HOW

1242
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
TO HAVE DISCOURSE AND PUT THE

1243
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
PASSION AWAY, AND I WOULD

1244
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
SUGGEST THAT ONE OF THE WAYS WE

1245
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
DO THAT, AS WE HAVE THESE

1246
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
DISCUSSIONS, I WANT YOU TO MANG

1247
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
YOU'RE TALKING TO ONE OF THESE

1248
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
6-YEAR-OLDS.
IF THAT 6-YEAR-OLD WAS IN THE

1249
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
ROOM WITH YOU, WOULD YOU SPEAK

1250
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
LIKE THAT?
IMAGINE IF YOU'RE A POLITICAL

1251
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
PERSON, IF THAT -- THOSE

1252
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
TEACHERS HAD THE COURAGE TO DO

1253
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
WHAT THEY DID, AND VICKY SOTO

1254
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
HAD THE COURAGE, AND DAWN

1255
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
HOCHSPRUNG, THEN LET'S HAVE OUR

1256
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
POLITICIANS HAVE THE COURAGE TO

1257
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
TALK CIVILLY TO EACH OTHER AND

1258
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
FIGURE THESE ISSUES OUT.

1259
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
WE CANNOT HAVE ANY MORE

1260
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
6-YEAR-OLDS AND 7-YEAR-OLDS DIE

1261
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
IN THEIR CLASSROOMS.

1262
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
>> DO WE NEED GREATER SECURITY

1263
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
AT ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE, HIGH

1264
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
SCHOOLS HERE IN CONNECTICUT,

1265
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES?

1266
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
>> I THINK THAT'S A HUGE PART OF

1267
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
THE DISCUSSION.
AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S

1268
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
SECURITY OR PERHAPS IT'S OUR

1269
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
BUILDING MATERIALS, THE GLASS

1270
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
WAS EASILY, YOU KNOW, SHOT

1271
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
THROUGH.
WHO WOULD HAVE EVER THOUGHT

1272
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
THAT?
I DON'T KNOW --

1273
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
>> BECAUSE HE FORCED HIS WAY

1274
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
INTO THAT SCHOOL.

1275
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
>> HE DID, FROM WHAT I

1276
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
UNDERSTAND, HE SHOT THE WINDOWS

1277
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
OUT.
YOU KNOW, WE HAD PREPARED FOR

1278
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
EVERYTHING EXCEPT THAT.

1279
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I'M SURE MOST SCHOOLS IN THE

1280
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
COUNTRY HAVEN'T CONSIDERED THAT

1281
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
OPTION.
LIKE IN OKLAHOMA, THE BOMBING,

1282
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
ONCE THAT HAPPENED, FEDERAL

1283
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
BUILDINGS HAD BIG THINGS IN

1284
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
FRONT OF THEM.

1285
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I DON'T WANT SCHOOLS TO BE A

1286
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
FORTRESS, I REALLY DON'T, BUT

1287
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
BULLETPROOF GLASS, AND THEN YOU

1288
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
GET INTO MONEY, SO THESE ARE

1289
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
DISCUSSIONS.

1290
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
THERE'S NO ONE ANSWER.

1291
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
IT'S A MULTILAYERED ANSWER.

1292
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I THINK A LOT OF IT IN OUR

1293
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
COUNTRY TODAY IS CIVIL

1294
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
DISCOURSE.

1295
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
SO I WOULD BEG EVERYONE, PLEASE,

1296
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
LET'S TRY TO HAVE A CIVIL

1297
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
DISCURIOUDI

1298
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
DISCOUR

1299
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
DISCOURSE.
WHEN YOU FEEL BECAUSE YOU'RE

1300
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
ANONYMOUS ON THE KEYBOARD YOU

1301
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
WANT TO TAKE THE GUY OUT YOU
DON'T AGREE WITH, TRY TO HAVE

1302
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
THESE ANGELS' FACES IN THEIR

1303
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
MIND BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT HELPING

1304
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
THEM AND YOU'RE NOT HELPING ALL

1305
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
THE CHILDREN IN THE UNITED

1306
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
STATES.
IT'S WHAT I HEARD AT THE VIGIL

1307
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
AND FROM WHAT I HEARD FROM

1308
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND WHAT I HEARD

1309
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
AT THE SERVICES TODAY.

1310
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
EVERYONE WANTS THIS.

1311
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
NOW WE HAVE TO EXECUTE ON IT.

1312
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
>> TELL US ABOUT THIS RIBBON.

1313
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
>> THIS RIBBON COMES FROM OUR

1314
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
LOCAL GROCERY STORE.
THEY'RE MAKING THEM IN THE

1315
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
FLORAL DEPARTMENT AND HANDING

1316
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
THEM OUT TO ANYONE WHO WANTS IT.

1317
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
THE COLORS REPRESENT SANDY HOOK

1318
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
SCHOOL.
THESE WERE OUR SCHOOL COLORS --

1319
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
ARE OUR SCHOOL COLORS.

1320
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
>> I'VE SEEN OTHER LITTLE

1321
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
RIBBONS THAT ARE SIMILAR THAT

1322
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
HAVE A LITTLE ANGEL.

1323
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
>> I KNOW, I WANT ONE OF THOSE.

1324
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
>> THE COMMUNITY, YOU KNOW, YOU
WALK AROUND, YOU JUST SEE THESE

1325
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
LITTLE MEMORIALS THAT ARE

1326
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
SPRINGING UP AND YOU SEE THESE

1327
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
NOTES FROM OTHER LITTLE KIDS,

1328
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
WRITING MESSAGES, WRITING NOTES.

1329
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
SOME THE -- TWO THE BOYS WERE

1330
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
BURIED TODAY.

1331
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
WHO COULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WE

1332
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
WOULD BE LIVING THROUGH

1333
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

1334
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
>> THERE'S A MEMORIAL ON THE

1335
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
ENTRANCE COMING INTO TOWN AT THE

1336
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
SKIN THERE.

1337
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
THERE'S MEMORIALS AT ANOTHER

1338
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
SCHOOL THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO

1339
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
WITH THIS.
IT'S INCREDIBLE, THE OUTPOURING,

1340
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
IT REALLY IS.

1341
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I'M ORIGINALLY FROM THE MIDWEST

1342
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
AND THE PEOPLE IN MY HOMETOWN OF

1343
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
KANSAS CITY, THE YOUTPOURING IS

1344
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
INCREDIBLE, REALLY IS

1345
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
INCREDIBLE.

1346
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW

1347
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
TOUCHING THAT IS TO KNOW THAT

1348
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
PEOPLE THAT I'VE KNOWN MY WHOLE

1349
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
LIFE THAT ARE NOT JUST IN KANSAS

1350
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
CITY ANYMORE.

1351
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I HAVE A FRIEND IN GERMANY AND

1352
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND THEY'RE

1353
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
ALL RESPONDING TO THIS.

1354
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S

1355
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS

1356
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
MESSAGE OUT AND LET'S ALL JOIN

1357
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
HANDS AND LET'S LEAD WITH LOVE

1358
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
IN EVERYTHING WE DO.

1359
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
NOT JUST GETTING THROUGH THIS

1360
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
TRAGEDY.
BUT REBUILDING WHAT WE WANT THIS

1361
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
COUNTRY TO DO FOR OUR CHILDREN.

1362
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
>> HOW ARE THESE PARENTS,

1363
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
THOUGH, GOING TO -- I CAN ONLY

1364
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
IMAGINE, YOU KNOW, YOU WERE
THERE AT THE FUNERAL, HOW COULD

1365
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
THESE PARENTS MOVE FORWARD NOW,

1366
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
KNOWING WHAT HAS JUST HAPPENED

1367
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
FRIDAY MORNING?
>> THAT'S A LONG JOURNEY.

1368
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF

1369
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
EXPERIENCE PERSONALLY WITH THAT.

1370
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
NOT LIKE THIS BUT A LITTLE BIT.

1371
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
AND IT'S A HOLLOWNESS.

1372
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
IT'S WEAK KNEES.

1373
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
IT'S ALL THE HORRIBLE THINGS

1374
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
EVERYONE IMAGINES.

1375
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
ALL YOU CAN DO IS TAKE IT A DAY

1376
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
AT A TIME AND DEPEND ON

1377
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
EVERYBODY YOU LOVE AND I WOULD

1378
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
TELL OUR COMMUNITY THAT TWO

1379
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
WEEKS IS ABOUT THE TIME THAT THE

1380
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
FAMILY GOES AWAY, AND THAT'S THE

1381
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
IMPORTANT TIME FOR FRIENDS TO

1382
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
RUSH IN.

1383
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
BECAUSE THEN ALL THE FAMILY

1384
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
MEMBERS ARE OUT OF TOWN.

1385
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF

1386
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
LOVE AND SUPPORT.

1387
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
IT REALLY IS.

1388
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
>> IT'S A MOURNING PROCESS.

1389
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
>> IT'S AWFUL.

1390
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
>> I CAN ONLY, YOU KNOW, I HAVE

1391
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
NO IDEA BUT IT'S -- EYE JUST

1392
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
SEEN A LITTLE BIT OF IT AND IT'S

1393
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
NORMALLY PARENTS BURY --

1394
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
CHILDREN BURY THEIR PARENTS.

1395
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
PARENTS SHOULDN'T BE BURYING

1396
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
THEIR KIDS, 6-YEAR-OLD AND

1397
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
7-YEAR-OLD LITTLE KIDS --

1398
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
>> NO, THAT'S THE HORROR OF

1399
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
THIS, THE REAL HORROR.

1400
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
AND THE FACT THAT TEACHERS WERE

1401
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
PROTECTING PEOPLE.
THAT DAWN TRIED TO STOP HIM.

1402
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
AND, YOU KNOW, I HEARD ON

1403
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
ANOTHER INTERVIEW --

1404
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
>> SHE WAS THE PRINCIPAL OF THE

1405
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
SCHOOL.
>> I'M SORRY, THE PRINCIPAL,

1406
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
YES.

1407
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I HEARD SOMEONE SAID IF SHE HAD

1408
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
HAD A GUN LOCKED IN HER OFFICE,

1409
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
SHE COULD HAVE TAKEN HIM ON.

1410
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
EXCUSE ME, SHE WAS IN ANOTHER

1411
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
MEETING, NOT HER OFFICE.

1412
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
TO GET TO HER OFFICE, SHE WOULD

1413
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
HAVE HAD TO HAVE GONE THROUGH

1414
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
THE GUNMAN.

1415
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT

1416
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
THESE TEACHERS DID AND NOT JUST
THE ONES WHO PASSED AWAY BUT

1417
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
THAT WHOLE SCHOOL, I KNOW ALL

1418
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
THOSE TEACHERS AND WHAT THEY DID

1419
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN AND TO

1420
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
KEEP THEM SAFE WAS INCREDIBLE.

1421
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
>> LILLIAN, THANKS FOR WHAT YOU

1422
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
DID, THANKS FOR INJOINING US,

1423
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
THANKS FOR SHARING YOUR

1424
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
THOUGHTS.
>> LEAD WITH LOVE, PLEASE.

1425
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
>> OUR VIEWERS HERE IN THE

1426
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE

1427
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
WORLD, THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCH

1428
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
WHAT'S GOING ON.

1429
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
MAYBE WE'LL LEARN SOME LESSONS.

1430
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
MAYBE DOWN THE ROAD WE CAN

1431
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
PREVENT THESE TRAGEDIES FROM

1432
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
HAPPENING.
LILLIAN, THANKS VERY MUCH.

1433
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
>>> WHILE EMOTIONS HERE IN

1434
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
NEWTOWN ARE TOO RAW TO BEGIN

1435
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
DEBATING WAYS TO STOP GUN

1436
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
VIOLENCE, THE TALK CERTAINLY

ALREADY STARTING BACK IN

WASHINGTON.
WE'LL HAVE THE LATEST FROM THE

WHITE HOUSE AFTER THIS.

1440
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
>> I AM VERY MINDFUL THAT MERE

1441
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
WORDS CANNOT MATCH THE DEPTHS OF

1442
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
YOUR SORROW, NOR CAN THEY HEAL

1443
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
YOUR WOUNDED HEARTS.

1444
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I CAN ONLY HOPE IT HELPS FOR YOU

1445
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN

1446
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
YOUR GRIEF.

1447
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
THAT OUR WORLD, TOO, HAS BEEN

1448
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
TORN APART.

1449
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
THAT ALL ACROSS THIS LAND OF

1450
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
OURS, WE HAVE WEPT WITH YOU.

1451
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
WE'VE PULLED OUR CHILDREN TIGHT.

1452
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
AND YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHATEVER

01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000

1632
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
LIVED A WONDERFUL LIFE.

1633
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
>> OUR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT

1634
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
DEBORAH FEYERICK IS STANDING BY

1635
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
OUTSIDE THE GUNMAN'S HOUSE WITH

1636
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
MORE ON THE INVESTIGATION.

1637
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU LEARNING, DEB?

1638
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
>> WELL, WOLF, WE CAN TELL YOU

1639
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
THAT SEVERAL UNMARKED POLICE

1640
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
CARS WENT INTO THE HOME AND HAVE

1641
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
BEEN GOING INTO THE HOME SINCE

1642
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
ABOUT 3:00 THIS AFTERNOON.

1643
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
THE HOME JUST BEHIND ME, THE

1644
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
ONLY LIGHTS THAT WE CAN SEE THAT

1645
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
ARE ON ARE ON THE GROUND FLOOR

1646
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
TO THE RIGHT.

1647
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
ALL THE OTHER ROOMS, THE SHADES

1648
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
ARE DRAWN.
VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT IS

1649
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
GOING ON INSIDE THAT HOME.

1650
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
AT LEAST TWO HOMES IN THIS AREA

1651
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
AS WE WERE DRIVING HERE HAVE

1652
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
UNMARKED POLICE CARS STATIONED

1653
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
OUT FRONT.

1654
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
WE ARE TOLD THAT UNMARKED POLICE

1655
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
CARS ARE BEING STATIONED AT ALL

1656
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
THE HOMES OF THOSE WHO LOST

1657
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
CHILDREN OR ADULTS IN THE

1658
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
MASSACRE.

1659
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
THE LANZA HOME IS STILL

1660
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
CONSIDERED A CRIME SCENE.

1661
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
AND POLICE SAY THEY HAVE SEIZED

1662
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
SOME SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE.

1663
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

1664
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
>> I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WE SEIZED

1665
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
EVIDENCE IF, IF, THERE IS

1666
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
COMPUTER EVIDENCE.

1667
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I STRONGLY SAY THAT, IF WE DO

1668
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
HAVE A COMPUTER CRIMES TEAM, AND

1669
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
THEN OUR STATE FORENSIC

1670
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
LABORATORY, THAT ARE EXPERTS IN

1671
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
RETREATING ANY KIND OF

1672
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
ELECTRONIC EVIDENCE AND DATA.

1673
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
>> WE'RE LEARNING A COUPLE OF

1674
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
THINGS ABOUT ADAM LANZA.

1675
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
HE WAS IN AND OUT OF VARIOUS

1676
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
SCHOOLS.

1677
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
IN 2007, AS A FRESHMAN, THE

1678
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
SCHOOL SECURITY DIRECTOR THERE

1679
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
WAS CONCERNED BECAUSE HE WAS --

1680
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
HE SEEMED SO VULNERABLE THAT THE

1681
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
DIRECTOR WAS CONCERNED HE WOULD

1682
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
BE PICKED ON, SO HE TOLD THE

1683
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
SECURITY OFFICERS TO MAKE SURE

1684
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

1685
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER, 2008,

1686
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
HE ENROLLED IN CLASSES AT A

1687
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
NEARBY COLLEGE, JUST ABOUT 15 --

1688
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
COMMUNITY COLLEGE, ABOUT 15

1689
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
MINUTES FROM HIS HOME.

1690
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
HE WAS TAKING COMPUTER SCIENCE

1691
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
AS WELL AS MACRO ECONOMICS,

1692
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000

1693
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
WE SPOKE TO ONE GIRL WHO WAS IN

1694
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
HIS GERMAN CLASS.

1695
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW HIM

1696
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
VERY WELL BUT AT ONE POINT SHE

1697
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000

01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
SURPRISED BY THAT, SHE DIDN'T

1701
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
UNDERSTAND JUST HOW YOUNG HE

1702
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
WAS.

1703
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
DESCRIBED AS A GENIUS BY ALL

1704
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000

1706
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO PUT

1707
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
TOGETHER PIECES OF THE COMPUTER

1708
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
HE SMASHED BEFORE HE WENT ON

1709
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
THIS RAMPAGE, WOLF.

1710
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000

01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
WE'VE BEEN TELLING YOU ABOUT THE

1714
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000

TRAGEDY.
>> WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE

1716
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
VICTIMS, NOT -- AS MUCH AS WE

01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000

WE WANT TO GIVE YOU A LOOK AT

1722
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000

TO DO THAT THROUGHOUT THE SHOW.

1724
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
ALLISON WYATT WAS QUIET AND A

1725
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
LITTLE SHY, BUT IF SOMEONE DID

1726
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
SOMETHING FUNNY, SHE'D BE THE

1727
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
FIRST ONE TO BURST OUT LAUGHING.

1728
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
AND JESSE LEWIS, HAD BEEN

1729
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKING

1730
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
GINGERBREAD HOUSES AT SCHOOL.

1731
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
HE LOVED MATH, RIDING HORSES AND

1732
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000

1733
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
VICTORIA SOTO ALWAYS WANTED TO

1734
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
BE AN EDUCATOR.

1735
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
JUST LIKE HER AUNT.

1736
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
THE FIRST GRADE TEACHER LOVED

1737
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
THE COLOR GREEN AND HER BLACK

1738
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
LAB, ROXIE.

1739
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
>> SHE WAS TRULY SELFLESS.

1740
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
SHE WOULD NOT HESITATE TO SAVE

1741
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
ANYONE ELSE BEFORE HERSELF AND

1742
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
ESPECIALLY CHILDREN.

1743
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
SHE LOVED THEM MORE THAN LIFE

1744
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
AND SHE WOULD DEFINITELY PUT

1745
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
HERSELF IN FRONT OF THEM.

1746
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
ANY DAY.
ANY DAY.

1747
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
FOR ANY REASON.

1748
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
SO IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ANYBODY

1749
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
THAT KNOWS VICKY THAT SHE DID

1750
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000

01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
>> IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.

1832
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
WE DID WANT TO RESPECT THE

1833
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
FAMILY'S WISHES.
THE FAMILY WANTED AS PRIVATE A

1834
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
SERVICE AS THEY COULD HAVE, AS

1835
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
PRIVATE A SERVICE AS THEY COULD

1836
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000

REPORTERS ARE HERE, HOW MANY

1838
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
CAMERAS ARE INTERESTED IN THIS.

1839
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
FROM THE DISTANCE WE WERE

1840
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
STANDING AWAY FROM THE CHURCH,

1841
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
WE COULD SEE THAT THIS WAS A

1842
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
VERY DIFFICULT DAY FOR THE

1843
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
FAMILY, THE FRIENDS, OF THIS
LITTLE BOY.

1844
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
A 6-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO WAS IN THE

1845
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
FIRST GRADE.

1846
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
THE PEOPLE ARRIVING NOT THE

YOUNG FAMILIES.

1849
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
A LOT OF YOUNG CHILDREN.

1850
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
THE CHILDREN WHO ARRIVED WERE

1851
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
WEARING NEWTOWN WRESTLING

1852
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
SHIRTS, LONG SLEEVE SHIRTS AND

1853
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
SWEATSHIRTS.

1854
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
ONE LITTLE BOY WAS WEARING A

1855
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
MEDAL.
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT

1856
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
MEDAL -- I'VE SPOKEN TO PEOPLE

1857
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
IN THE WRESTLING COMMUNITY HERE

1858
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
IN CONNECTICUT.

1859
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
ONE TOWN THAT'S NEARBY SAID THAT

1860
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
JACK HAD JUST COMPETED IN HIS

1861
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
FIRST WRESTLING MATCH.

1862
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
HIS FIRST OFFICIAL WRESTLING

1863
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
MATCH.
AND HAD WON HIS FIRST MEDAL.

1864
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
THIS LITTLE BOY LOVED SPORTS BUT

1865
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
HIS FIRST LOVE WAS FOOTBALL AND

1866
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
HIS IDOL WAS NEW YORK GIANT

1867
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
PLAYER VICTOR CRUZ.

1868
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
NOW, THAT MESSAGE GOT TO THE

1869
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
FOOTBALL PLAYER.

1870
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
HE DECIDED THAT HE WANTED TO PUT

1871
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
THE LITTLE BOY'S NAME ON HIS

1872
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
CLEATS AND HIS GLOVES.

1873
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
HE TWEETED OUT A PICTURE OF IT.

1874
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
HE THEN CALLED JACK'S FAMILY.

1875
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
HERE'S WHAT CRUZ TOLD REPORTERS.

1876
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
>> IT WAS EMOTIONAL, MAN, YOU

1877
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
KNOW, I WAS FIGHTING BACK TEARS

1878
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
A LITTLE BIT TO DO IT.

1879
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
IT FELT GOOD TO HONOR A FAMILY

1880
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
THAT WAS GOING THROUGH SO MUCH.

1881
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
JUST THE THOUGHT OF YOUR LITTLE

1882
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
ONE OR YOUR CHILD, YOUR SON OR

1883
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
DAUGHTER, GOING THROUGH

1884
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW,

1885
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
IT WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE TO EVEN

1886
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
LISTEN TO ON THE NEWS.

1887
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
THAT NIGHT, I PUT MY DAUGHTER IN

1888
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
THE BED WITH ME.

1889
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
>> THE FAMILY IS REPORTEDLY

1890
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
BURYING THEIR SON IN A VICTOR

1891
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
CRUZ JERSEY.

1892
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
A VERY DIFFICULT DAY.

1893
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
JUST THE VERY FIRST OF WHAT WILL

1894
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
BE MANY MORE FUNERALS, WOLF.

1895
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
>> HOW SAD IS THIS, UNBELIEVABLY

1896
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
SAD.
THANKS, KYUNG LAH, FOR THAT.

1897
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000

01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
POPPING UP AROUND THIS TOWN.

1901

CNN'S DON LEMON IS JOINING US

1902
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000

1903
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
JUST A LITTLE BIT DOWN THE ROAD

1904
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
FROM WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW.

1905
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
DON, THESE MEMORIALS REALLY HAVE

1906
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
A WAY OF LETTING PEOPLE EXPRESS

1907
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
THEIR EMOTIONS.

1908
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
THIS IS A HUGE, HUGE TRAGEDY.

1909
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
>> YEAH, IT IS A HUGE TRAGEDY.

1910

01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
>> FROM MY CHILDREN, SOMETHING

1924
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
THAT THEY'VE HAD.
>> WHY DID YOU COME OUT?

1925

1926
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,000

SOME PEOPLE WILL NEVER, EVER,

2032
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000

01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
THAT TYPICALLY DOESN'T DECREASE

2343
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
VIOLENCE AND IT CAN ACTUALLY

2344
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
DECREASE THE PERCEIVED SENSE OF

2345
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
SAFETY IN THAT SCHOOL.

GREATER SENSE OF SECURITY.

ESTABLISH A CRISIS RESPONSE TEAM

2357
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
TO DEAL WITH ANY EMERGENCY.

2358
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
THEY SHOULD ALSO COMMUNICATE

KEEP CHILDREN SAFE.

2362
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
THEY SHOULD REVIEW ALL SAFETY

2363
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
POLICIES AND HAVE ADEQUATE

2364
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000

STARTED RINGING OUT.

2463
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
>> DAWN PUT HERSELF IN JEOPARDY.

2464
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I HAD BEEN ANGRY ABOUT THAT,

SHE ACTUALLY CONFRONTED THE

01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
GUNMAN AND SHE COULD NOT -- SHE

2470
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
COULD HAVE AVOIDED THAT.

2471
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
BUT SHE DIDN'T.

2472
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,000
I KNEW SHE WOULDN'T.

2473
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
SO I'M NOT ANGRY ANYMORE.

2474
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I'M NOT ANGRY.

AND ACTUALLY TRIED TO SUBDUE THE

2486
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:24,000
KILLER.

2487
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000

STUDENTS EXPERIENCED A SIMILAR

SHOCK AND SADNESS AS THOSE HERE

2530
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000

2531
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW.

DEADLIEST SCHOOL SHOOTING IN

U.S. HISTORY, A FATHER SOMEHOW

2542
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
FOUND THE WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE

2543
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
UNTHINKABLE.
A DAUGHTER, NOT PICKING UP HER

2544
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
CELL PHONE.
>> I COULD ONLY ASSUME THE WORST

2545
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT RESPONDING,

2546
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
NOBODY KNEW WHO SHE WAS.

2547
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000

18-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, THE STAR

2549
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
STUDENT, THE TEENAGER WHO

2550
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,000
THOUGHT DANCE COULD CHANGE THE

2551
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
WORLD.
WHO WAS SHOT TO DEATH IN FRENCH

2552
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
CLASS.
AND THAT DAY HE TALKED ABOUT HER

2553
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
MAINLY IN THE PRESENT TENSE.

2554
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
>> I KEEP HER IN MY MIND.

2555
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
HER FACE IS IN MY MENTAL VISION.

2556
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
AND IT KEEPS ME GOING.

2557
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
>> Reporter: IT'S BEEN WHAT'S

2558
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
KEPT HIM GOING FOR MORE THAN

2559
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
FIVE YEARS.

2560
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
WHAT IS IT LIKE TALKING ABOUT

2561
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
HER TODAY?

2562
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:46,000
>> OH, HASN'T CHANGED.

2563
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
SHE'S IN MY HEART.

2564
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
>> Reporter: REMEMBERED IN THE

2565
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
FAMILY PICTURES, ON THE FLAG IN

2566
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
THE FRONT YARD.

2567
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
BUT SHE HAS BEEN MISSED AT SO

2568
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
MUCH.
WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HER

2569
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
GRADUATION.
HER FUNERAL.

2570
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
HER MEMORIALS.

2571
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
HER FATHER SAYS NEWTOWN MADE THE

2572
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
MISSING WORSE ALL OVER AGAIN.

2573
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:07,000
>> THE TRAUMA IS ONLY SKIN DEEP.

2574
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
SO EVERY TIME SOMETHING LIKE

2575
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:14,000
THIS HAPPENED, YOU OPEN THE

2576
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:19,000
WOUND.
BUT I WILL SAY THAT MY THERAPY,

2577
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
IS DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

2578
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
>> Reporter: HE SAID WHEN

2579
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
VIRGINIA TECH HAPPENED, THERE

2580
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
WAS NO ONE TO ASK HOW DO YOU GET

2581
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
THROUGH.

2582
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
SO HE AND OTHER VICTIM'S

2583
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,000
FAMILIES STARTED THE VTV FAMILY

2584
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
OUTREACH FOUNDATION.

2585
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,000
ADVOCATES FOR CAMPUS SAFETY.

2586
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
TRAINED TO OFFER VICTIM'S

2587
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
FAMILIES SUPPORT.

2588
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
>> THEY'RE GOING TO BE ANGRY.

2589
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
THEY'RE GOING TO BE DEPRESSED.

2590
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,000
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SHOCKED.

2591
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS IS THERE

2592
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

2593
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
BUT THEY'LL HAVE QUESTIONS.

2594
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
THEIR EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE

2595
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
PARTICULAR TO THEM.

2596
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
WE MAY HAVE SOME ANSWERS.

2597
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,000
BUT WE ARE THERE TO BE AT THEIR

2598
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
SERVICE.
THAT'S WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR

2599
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
IN OUR TRAGEDY AT VIRGINIA TECH.

2600
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
>> Reporter: JOSEPH SOMAHAHA

2601
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
SAYS THEY WILL ONLY HELP IN

2602
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
NEWTOWN IF ASKED TO DO SO.

2603
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
HIS ADVICE, VICTIM'S FAMILIES

2604
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES

2605
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
FIRST AND FOCUS ON ISSUES LIKE

2606
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
GUN CONTROL, SCHOOL SAFETY AND

2607
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
MENTAL HEALTH LATER.

2608
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:24,000
EMILY SCHMIDT, CNN, WASHINGTON.

2609
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
>> CERTAINLY REMEMBER SPEAKING

2610
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
WITH JOSEPH.
HE MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION ON ME

2611
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
INTERVIEWING HIM IN THE WAKE OF

2612
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
THAT VIRGINIA TECH UNIVERSITY

2613
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
TRAGEDY.

2614
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO HIM AS WELL

2615
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,000
AS THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF ALL OF
THOSE KILLED IN THAT TRAGEDY.

2616
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
HERE IN THE NEWTOWN,

2617
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
CONNECTICUT, TRAGEDY, ALL THE

2618
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE ALL

2619
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
WE'RE SICK AND TIRED OF COVERING

2620
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
THESE STORIES.

2621
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
WE'VE COVERED WAY TOO MANY OF

2622
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
THEM OVER THESE YEARS.

2623
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
MANY PEOPLE ARE WONDERING, HOW

2624
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,000
EASY IS IT FOR SOMEONE TO BUY AN

2625
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
AUTOMATIC RIFLE LIKE THE ONE THE

2626
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,000
SHOOTER USED HERE IN NEWTOWN,

2627
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
CONNECTICUT, AT THE SANDY HOOK

2628
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
WE'RE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK.

2629
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
MUCH MORE COMING UP.

2630
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
A SPECIAL EDITION OF "THE

2631
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
SITUATION ROOM" CONTINUES RIGHT
AFTER THIS.

2632
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:14,000
asty.

2633
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
And cut! Very good.

2634
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

2635
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

2636
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

2637
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
It's not real.

2638
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

2639
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

2640
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

2641
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

2642
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
>>> UNDERSTANDABLY, THERE'S

2643
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
CERTAINLY BEEN A LOT OF TALK

2644
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
ABOUT THE GUNS USED IN THE NEW

2645
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,000
TOWN, CONNECTICUT, MASSACRE,

2646
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
PARTICULARLY THE SEMIAUTOMATIC

2647
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
ASSAULT-TYPE RIFLE THAT WAS

2648
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
REPORTEDLY USED IN MOST OF THE

2649
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
KILLINGS.

2650
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
SO HOW UNUSUAL IS THIS WEAPON?

2651
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,000
HOW EASY IS IT TO GET ONE HERE

2652
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
IN THE UNITED STATES?

2653
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
OUR PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT CHRIS

2654
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
LAWRENCE HAS BEEN LOOKING INTO

2655
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
THESE QUESTIONS FOR US.

2656
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
CHRIS, TELL US WHAT YOU CAN

2657
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
ABOUT THIS EXTREMELY DEADLY

2658
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
WEAPON.
>> FIRST OF ALL, WOLF, THEY'RE

2659
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
EVERYWHERE.
I MEAN, YOU CAN LITERALLY BUY

2660
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
THIS RIFLE AT NEARLY 2,000

2661
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
WALMART STORES ALL ACROSS THE

2662
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
COUNTRY.
THERE ARE LITERALLY MILLIONS OF

2663
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
THESE RIFLES IN HOMES ACROSS

2664
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
AMERICA.
AND SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH, AFTER

2665
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN CONNECTICUT,

2666
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
THAT NUMBER MAY BE GOING UP.

2667
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:51,000
NOT DOWN.

2668
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,000
THE AR-15 HAS ALWAYS BEEN A TOP

2669
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
SELLER AT THIS VIRGINIA GUN

2670
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
SHOP.
BUT CHUCK SAYS SINCE FRIDAY'S

2671
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
SHOOTING, SALES HAVE BEEN

2672
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
SURGING.
>> PEOPLE WANT TO GET THEM

2673
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSES

2674
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
ANY RESTRICTION AND THEY'RE

2675
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
BUYING THEM UP IN RECORD NUMBERS

2676
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
RIGHT NOW.
>> Reporter: WE WEREN'T IN THE

2677
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
STORE FOR FIVE MINUTES BEFORE

2678
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
CUSTOMERS STARTED CALLING FOR

2679
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
GUNS AND AMMO.

2680
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:19,000
>> THOSE MAGAZINES ARE SELLING

2681
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,000
FAST.
IN ANTICIPATION OF THE POSSIBLE

2682
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
BAN ON MAGAZINES.

2683
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
>> Reporter: HE CAN'T KEEP

2684
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
ENOUGH OF THE AR-15.

2685
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
>> WE DO HAVE IN STOCK, IN THE

2686
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,000
STORE, THREE OTHER GUNS THAT ARE

2687
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,000
OF THE SAME QUALITY AS THE

2688
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
BUSHMASTER.
>> Reporter: HOW MANY ROUNDS CAN

2689
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
THIS FIRE PER SECOND?

2690
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
>> HOW FAST CAN YOU PULL THE

2691
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
TRIGGER?
>> Reporter: THE AR-15 IS

2692
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC, MEANING ONE

2693
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
BULLET PER TRIGGER PULL.

2694
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,000
AN AVERAGE CLIP CARRIES 30

2695
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
ROUNDS.

2696
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
IT'S A VARIATION OF THE

2697
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
MILITARY'S M-16.

2698
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000

01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:56,000
>> EVERY DAY THERE MORE PEOPLE

2878
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
COMING TO GIVE SUPPORT AND BE

2879
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
PART OF THE COMMUNITY EVEN FROM

2880
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
OUTSIDE.
YOU WENT TO THAT FIREHOUSE AND

2881
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:06,000
YOU SAW THE MEMORIALS, I SAT IN

2882
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
ON A SUNDAY CHURCH SERVICE

2883
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,000
YESTERDAY AND THE PASTOR THERE

2884
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:13,000
WAS AT THE FIREHOUSE TO FIND OUT

2885
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
NEWS OF THEIR CHILDREN.

2886
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
ONE OF THEIR MEMBERS LOST A

2887
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
CHILD, BENJAMIN WHEELER, IN THE

2888
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,000
SHOOTING.

2889
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
SHE SPOKE SO POWERFULLY AND SO

2890
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
EMOTIONALLY, BUT WITH SUCH

2891
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:28,000
STRENGTH DURING HER SERVICE.

2892
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
SHE SAID I'M DONE.

2893
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,000
GO.

2894
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,000
>> THIS IS HALLOWED GROUND.

2895
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
THAT'S WHERE EVERYONE GATHERED.

2896
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
ALL THE FAMILIES DOWN THE

2897
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,000
STREET.

2898
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:49,000
THEY STAYED THERE.

2899
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
ANOTHER EXAMPLE I LEARNED

2900
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:03,000
DRIVING AROUND IN AREAS.

2901
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
THIS IS A FIRST RESPONDER HERE

2902
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000

2903
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
GRANDCHILD AT SANDY HOOK AND HIS

2904
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,000
WIFE IS A SCHOOL BUS DRIVER FOR

2905
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM.
EVERYONE IS IMPACTED.

2906
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
EVERYONE.

2907
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
>> IT'S TRUE.

2908
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
DURING HIS VERY, VERY POWERFUL

2909
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:24,000
SPEECH LAST NIGHT AT THIS

2910
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
MEMORIAL, THE PRESIDENT READ THE

2911
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:30,000

SAYING GOD HAS CALLED THEM ALL

2913
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
HOME.
WE HAVE TAKEN HIS WORDS OUT OF

2914
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:39,000
THE PICTURES HE NAMED.

2915
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
>> LET THE LITTLE CHILDREN COME

2916
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
TO ME, JESUS SAID.

2917
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,000
DO NOT HINDER THEM.

2918
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
FOR TO SUCH BELONGS THE KIMDOM

2919
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:51,000
OF HEAVEN.

2920
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:01,000
CHARLOTTE, DANIEL, OLIVIA,

2921
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:17,000

2926
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
GOD HAS CALL THEM ALL HOME.

2927
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:47,000
FOR THOSE OF US WHO REMAIN, LET

2928
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:51,000
US FIND THE STRENGTH TO CARRY ON

2929
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,000
AND MAKE OUR COUNTRY WORTHY OF

2930
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:57,000
THEIR MEMORY.

2931
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
.
>> HEARTBROKEN FAMILIES CLING TO

2932
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:10,000
ONE ANOTHER.
SURVIVORS SAY GOODBYE.

2933
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
THE FIRST YOUNG VICTIMS OF THE

2934
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MASSACRE ARE

2935
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:18,000
BURIED AND THE GRIEF IS

2936
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
OVERWHELMING.

2937
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
>> IT'S EVERYTHING YOU CAN

2938
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,000
IMAGINE PLUS SOME.

2939
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
IT'S WORSE.

2940
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,000
>> I'M WOLF BLITZER IN NEWTOWN,

2941
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
CONNECTICUT.
THE STATE'S GOVERNOR SAID THERE

2942
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE PAIN OF

2943
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
PARENTS BURYING THEIR CHILDREN

2944
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
LET ALONE CHILDREN KILLED IN

2945
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,000
SUCH A HORRIFIC ACT OF VIOLENCE.

2946
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
6-YEAR-OLDS JACK PINTO AND NOAH

2947
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
POSNER ARE THE FIRST VICTIMS OF

2948
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING

2949
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
TO BE LAID TO REST.

2950
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:50,000
THERE WILL BE TWO DOZEN MORE

2951
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
BURIALS JUST AS GUT WRENCHING AS

2952
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
THE ONES HERE TODAY.

2953
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
POLICE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT

2954
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
THE GUNMAN, ADAM LNZA.

2955
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE LATEST ON

2956
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:03,000
THE INVESTIGATION FOR US.
WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING?

2957
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
>> WE CAN TELL YOU WITHIN THE

2958
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
LAST HALF HOUR, FOUR UNMARKED

2959
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,000
POLICE CARS WITH DETECTIVES

2960
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:12,000
PULLED OUT OF THE LANZA HOME.

2961
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,000
THERE HAVE BEEN LIGHTS ON IN THE

2962
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
GROUND FLOOR IN THE CORNER ROOM.

2963
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
THOSE LIGHTS OFF THE SHADES

2964
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
DRAWN ACROSS THE HOME IN THIS

2965
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:22,000
PARTICULAR AREA.
WE HAVE PASSED A COUPLE OF HOMES

2966
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
THAT HAVE SQUAD CARS IN FRONT OF

2967
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,000
THEM.

2968
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,000
PATROL CARS IN FRONT OF THEM.

2969
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
WE BELIEVE THOSE ARE HOMES THAT

2970
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
SOME OF THE VICTIMS HAD.

2971
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
LANZA'S HOME IS A CRIME SCENE.

2972
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
THEY WERE ABLE TO RECOVER PIECES

2973
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,000
OF A SMASHED COMPUTER.

2974
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
THAT COMPUTER NOW BEING ANALYZED

2975
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
BY LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLKS WHO ARE

2976
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
ABLE TO RETRIEVE A LOT OF DATA.

2977
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,000
THEY ARE LOOKING AT E-MAILS AND

2978
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,000
WANT TO KNOW WHAT WEBSITES HE

2979
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
VISIT AND WHO HE MAY HAVE COME

2980
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
INTO CONTACT WITH AND WHY HE MAY

2981
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,000
HAVE CHOSEN THIS SCHOOL TO CARRY

2982
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,000
OUT THE MASSACRE.

2983
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,000
THE DETAILS ARE SKETCHY, BUT

2984
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,000
STARTING TO COME TOGETHER.

2985
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
>> ADAM LANZA MOVED INTO THIS

2986
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
HOUSE WHEN HE WAS ABOUT 6 YEARS

2987
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
OLD, THE SAME AGE AS THE FIRST

2988
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,000
GRADERS HE IS ACCUSED OF

2989
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
KILLING.

2990
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,000
HE DID NOT GO TO SANDY HOOK

2991
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
ELEMENTARY, BUT A WOMAN SAID HER

2992
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,000
CHILD AND ADAM LANZA HAD BEEN

2993
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,000
CLASSMATES THERE IN THE FIRST

2994
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
AND THIRD GREATS.

2995
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
POLICE ARE SEARCHING FOR A

2996
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
CONNECTION AS TO WHY HE CHOSE TO

2997
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
CARRY OUT THE MASSACRE THERE

2998
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000
LAST WEEK.

2999
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,000
LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT ADAM

3000
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
LANZA, BUT AS A FRESHMAN IN

3001
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:36,000
2007, LANZA SEEMED SO

3002
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,000
VULNERABLE.

3003
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
THE FORMER SCHOOL SECURITY

3004
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
DIRECTOR TOLD CNN HE WARNED HIS

3005
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
SCHOOL OFFICERS TO KEEP AN EYE

3006
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
ON THE CHILD SO HE WOULD NOT BE

3007
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
PICKED ON OR BULLIED.

3008
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,000
LANZA WAS ASSIGNED TO SCHOOL

3009
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS AS THE SECURITY

3010
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
DIRECTOR.
THOUGH LANZA JOINED THE TECH

3011
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:57,000
CLUB, HE REMAINED WITH DRAWN.

3012
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
AT AGE 16, LANZ ENROLLED AS A

3013
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
STUDENT AT WESTERN CONNECTICUT

3014

STATE UNIVERSITY ABOUT 15

3015
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
MINUTES FROM HIS HOME, TAKING

COMPUTER SCIENCE, AMERICAN

3018
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
HISTORY AND MACRO ECONOMICS.

3019
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
HE DROPPED OUT IN 2009 AND DID

3020
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
NOT RETURN.

3021
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,000
HIS HIGH SCHOOL FRIEND RAN INTO

3022
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
NANCY LANZA AND HE SAID THE MOM

3023
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:21,000
SAID HE WAS DOING REALLY WELL IN

3024
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,000
COLLEGE.

3025
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
SHE TOLD HIM SHE TAKEN HIM

3026
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
SHOOTING AS A HOBBY AND LIKED TO

3027
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,000
GO TO THE GUN RANGE.

3028
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
>> IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER SHE WAS

3029
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
CONTINUING HIS EDUCATION, BUT

3030
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
CNN LEARNED HIS MOTHER CONFIDED

3031
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
TO A FRIEND THIS WAS LIKELY HER

3032
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
LAST WINTER HERE IN NEWTOWN,

3033
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
CONNECTICUT.

3034
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
SHE WANTED TO GO SOMEWHERE WHERE

3035
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
HE COULD GO TO COLLEGE.

3036
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
SHE WAS LOOKING TO GO ACROSS

3037
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
COUNTRY TO WASHINGTON STATE,

3038
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
POSSIBLY PUTTING HIM IN COURSES

3039
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,000
THERE.
HE IS DESCRIBED AS A GENIUS,

3040
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,000
INCREDIBLY SMART AND SOME OF HIS

3041
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
FRIENDS WHO TALK ABOUT HIM SAY

3042
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
WHILE HE WAS VERY, VERY QUIET

3043
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:00,000
AND SHY, ONCE YOU GOT HIM TO

3044
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
OPEN UP HE SEEMED TO JOKE.

3045
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
HE ENJOYED BEING IN THAT

3046
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
COMPANY.

3047
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
EXTREMELY WITH DRAWN.

3048
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
INVESTIGATORS HOPE THEY CAN

3049
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,000
PIECE TOGETHER THE INVESTIGATION

3050
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:13,000
ON THAT COMPUTER.
THEY DESCRIBED IT AS SEIZING

3051
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
VERY GOOD EVIDENCE.

3052
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
WHAT THAT EVIDENCE IS, WHEN

3053
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE ARE

3054
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
READY TO RELEASE IT, THEY WILL

3055
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE.

3056
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
WOLF?

3057
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000

02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:15,000
RIGHT NOW.
THANKS FOR THAT.

3239
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,000
SANJAY GUPTA IS JOINING US.

3240
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
YOU HAVE BEEN OUT AND WORKING ON

3241
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,000
SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL THAT YOU

3242
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
ARE GOING TO BE SHARING WITH OUR

3243
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
VIEWERS LATER THIS HOUR.

3244
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:26,000
>> WE TEND TO LOOK AT A LOT OF

3245
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:30,000
THESE PREVIOUS TRAGEDIES IN

3246
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
HINDSIGHT.
THE QUESTION A LOT OF PEOPLE

3247
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
HAVE, CLUES THAT PEOPLE CAN DO

3248
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,000
PROACTIVELY OR RECOGNIZE THAT IS

3249
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
TOUGH AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE.

3250
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
IF YOU LOOK THROUGHOUT THE

3251
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
HISTORY, WHAT CHARACTERIZES SOME

3252
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,000
OF THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN

3253
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
INVOLVED WITH THE TRAGEDIES.

3254
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
THAT'S WHAT WE DECIDED TO FOCUS

3255
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
ON.
THESE ARE SPECIFIC THINGS.

3256
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,000
>> YOU HAVE SOME COMMON THREADS?

3257
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
>> COMMON THREADS.

3258
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,000
AGAIN THERE OBVIOUSLY NO RULE

3259
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:58,000
WHEN IS IT COMES TO THAT SORT OF

3260
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,000
STUFF.

3261
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,000
DESPITE WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN

3262
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
TALKING B THESE ARE FEW AND FAR

3263
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
BETWEEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE

3264
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
NUMBERS.
A FEW PEOPLE ARE EXPERTS AND

3265
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:10,000
THEY TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF

3266
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,000
PEOPLE HARDLY EVER SNAP.

3267
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
THAT'S COME UP QUITE A BIT.

3268
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:14,000
YOU HAVE TO KNOW SPECIFICALLY

3269
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:17,000
WHERE TO LOOK AND THE PATTERNS.

3270
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEEN FOLK E

3271
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
USING O.

3272
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
>> IF THERE IS MORE RESEARCH,

3273
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
MAYBE THEY CAN PREVENT THE

3274
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
TRAGEDIES.
>> EXACTLY.

3275
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:29,000
>> THIS IS IN THE CONTEXT THAT

3276
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,000
IS UNDER RESOURCED AND DIFFICULT

3277
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
TO GET PEOPLE INTO.

3278
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,000
ONE THING HA IS INTERESTING AND

3279
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
WE WILL TALK ABOUT IS THE IDEA

3280
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:40,000
OF MEDICATIONS.
WHEN YOU GIVE MEDICATIONS, THERE

3281
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:42,000
VULNERABLE TIMES WHEN YOU ARE

3282
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,000
STARTING AND TAKING A PATIENT

3283
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,000
OFF THE MEDICATION.

3284
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,000
THESE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU CAN

3285
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,000
INDUCE PSYCHOSIS.

3286
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:53,000
LOSS OF TOUCH WITH REALITY.

3287
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
DECREASED JUDGMENT AND

3288
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
IMPULSIVITY.

3289
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,000
PEOPLE NEED TO BE MONITORED.

3290
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
THIS IS NOT CASTING BLAME, BUT

3291
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:05,000
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MONITORS.

3292
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
>> WHY DO YOU THINK WHEN WE LOOK

3293
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:12,000
AT THE THINGS IN HINDSIGHT THAT

3294
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
IS RIGHT AND DO YOU THINK --

3295
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:17,000
WHERE DO YOU THINK THE MAJOR

3296
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:20,000
ISSUE IS IN TERMS OF DIAGNOSING

3297
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
MENTAL ILLNESS AND GETTING

3298
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
PEOPLE IN TO THE MENTAL HEALTH

3299
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,000
SYSTEM.

3300
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:28,000
WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THIS AFTER

3301
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
EVERY TRAGEDY.
>> FOR ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE WE TALK

3302
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
ABOUT THIS.

3303
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:32,000
ONE THING I HAVE LEARNED THAT

3304
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
MAY BE SURPRISING, PEOPLE SEEM

3305
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:37,000
TO THINK THE SIGNS WERE IGNORED.

3306
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
THAT'S HARDLY EVER THE CASE

3307
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
ACTUALLY.
FAMILIES DO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS

3308
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:44,000
AND LOVED ONES AND NEIGHBORS.

3309
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
AND THEY ANGUISH OVER IT.

3310
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
THE PROBLEM IS THE NEXT STEP.

3311
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
THE THRESHOLD FOR GETTING PEOPLE

3312
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,000
IN IS USUALLY IF THEY HAVE

3313
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
IMMINENT HARM TO THEMSELVES OR

3314
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,000
OTHERS.

3315
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,000
THAT'S THE THRESHOLD AND LIKE

3316
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:59,000
HAVING A HEARD ATTACK.

3317
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:00,000
THAT'S TOO LATE AS YOU KNOW.

3318
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:03,000
YOU HAVE TO TREAT THE PEOPLE

3319
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
EARLIER.
IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE SIGNS THAT

3320
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
ARE BEING RECOGNIZED, BUT THE

3321
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:12,000
SYSTEM HAS FAILED.

3322
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,000
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY

3323
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:19,000
MENTAL HEALTH.

3324
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,000
>> THEY DECREASE THE STIGMA

3325
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT.

3326
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:28,000
>> THE FULL REPORT LATER THIS

3327
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,000
HOUR.
EMERGENCY OFFICIALS HERE IN

3328
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
NEWTOWN ARE PAYING TRIBUTE TO

3329
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
THE VICTIMS OF THE SCHOOL

3330
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:34,000
MASSACRE.

3331
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,000
CHILDREN DESPERATELY HOPE TO

3332
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,000
SAVE AND THEY COULDN'T.

3333
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:39,000
WE WILL HEAR FROM A FIREFIGHTER.

3334
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:40,000
>> ALSO WILL PRESIDENT OBAMA

3335
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
LIVE UP TO HIS PROMISE TO THE

3336
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
PEOPLE OF NEW AND THE NATION TO

3337
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:49,000
TRY TO PREVENT FUTURE SHOOTING

3338
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:56,000
TRAGEDIES.

3339
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
>>> AS THE FIRST YOUNG VICTIMS

3340
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
ARE BURIED HERE IN CONNECTICUT,

3341
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
THE CRIES ARE GROWING LOUDER FOR

3342
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:20,000
NEW FEDERAL GUN CONTROL

3343
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,000
MEASURES.

3344
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,000
SOME BELIEVE IT COULD BE A

3345
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
TURNING POINT IN THE GUN DEBATE

3346
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
IN AMERICA IF THE PRESIDENT OF

3347
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,000
THE UNITED STATES FOLLOWS

3348
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
THROUGH ON HIS CALL TO ACTION.

3349
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:32,000
LET'S GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

3350
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
BRIANNA KEILAR HAS THE LATEST.

3351
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
>> I'M NOT SURE IF YOU NOTICED,

3352
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,000
BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS NOT EVEN

3353
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
UTTERED THE WORD GUN SINCE THE

3354
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
SHOOTING ON FRIDAY.

3355
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
GUN RIGHTS ADVOCATES HAVE STAYED

3356
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:48,000
OUT OF THIS DEBATE, BUT GUN

3357
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
CONTROL ADVOCATES HAVE NOT.

3358
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
THE PRESIDENT IS MISSING AN

3359
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:55,000
OPPORTUNITY TO OUTLINE SPECIFIC

3360
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:56,000
GUN CONTROL MEASURES BECAUSE

3361
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
THEY SAY PUBLIC INTEREST IN THIS

3362
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
IS HIGH ON AN ISSUE THAT HAS NOT

3363
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,000
BEEN A PRIORITY FOR PRESIDENT

3364
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:06,000
OBAMA OR CONGRESS IN RECENT

3365
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:07,000
YEARS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA PROMISED SUNDAY

3366
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
IN NEWTOWN TO TAKE ACTION.

3367
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:13,000
>> IN THE COMING WEEKS I WILL

3368
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:14,000
USE WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE

3369
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
HOLDS TO ENGAGE MY FELLOW

3370
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
CITIZENS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

3371
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,000
MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO

3372
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
PARENTS AND EDUCATORS IN AN

3373
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
EFFORT AIMED AT PREVENTING MORE

3374
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS.

3375
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:29,000
>> HERE GAVE NO SPECIFICS.

3376
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
DIANNE FEINSTEIN WANTS TO BAN

3377
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:32,000
SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

3378
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
>> HE IS GOING TO HAVE A BILL TO

3379
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
LEAD ON BECAUSE AS A FIRST DAY

3380
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
BILL, I WILL INTRODUCE IN THE

3381
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
SENATE AND THE SAME BILL WILL BE

3382
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:44,000
INTRODUCED IN THE HOUSE, A BILL

3383
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,000
TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS.

3384
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:48,000
>> FAR FROM FAKE TAKING THE LET,

3385
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,000
THEY WON'T SEE IF THE WHITE

3386
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
HOUSE WILL SUPPORT THE BILL.

3387
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:56,000
JAY KARN CARNEY DID NOT SUPPORT

3388
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,000
MEASURE.

3389
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:00,000
THAT IRKS A NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS

3390
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,000
CHO WHO SUPPORT GUN CONTROL

3391
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:07,000
INCLUDING CONGRESSWOMAN CAROLYN

3392
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,000
CARTHY WHOSE HUSBAND DIED AND

3393
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
SON WAS INJURIED ON A LONG

3394
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
ISLAND TRAIN IN 1993.

3395
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,000
>> WHEN THE WHITE HOUSE, CARNEY

3396
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:18,000
CAME OUT AND SAID THIS WAS NOT A

3397
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
TIME TO TALK ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE

3398
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:23,000
AND LEGISLATION.
I CALLED THE WHITE HOUSE AND IT

3399
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:26,000
WAS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

3400
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,000
ABOUT?
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TALKING

3401
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:28,000
ABOUT THIS YEARS AGO.

3402
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:31,000
>> McCARTHY AND OTHERS INCLUDING

3403
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
NEW YORK MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG

3404
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:34,000
SAID NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT

3405
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
WHILE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS

3406
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS

3407
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:41,000
TRAGEDY.
AFTER PAST SHOOTINGS, CONGRESS'S

3408
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:44,000
APPETITE TO ACT ON GUN VIOLENCE

3409
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,000
WANED QUICKLY.

3410
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:49,000
>> INNOCENT IT MORE LIKELY THAT

3411
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
PEOPLE PRERE TREAT TO THEIR

3412
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
CORNERS WHICH YOU DON'T WANT TO

3413
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
SEE FURTHER OUT FROM THE EVENT.

3414
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:00,000
>> IT IS HARD TO THINK ABOUT 20

3415
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,000
6 AND 7-YEAR-OLDS AND WHAT

3416
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,000
HAPPENED TO THEM ON FRIDAY AND

3417
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:09,000
IMAGINE IN A FEW WEEKS OR A FEW

02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:38,000
TRANSITIONING INTO THE TEMPORARY

3957
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:39,000
SCHOOL.
SOME WERE ASKING IF THEY WERE

3958
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:42,000
ONLY BACK FOR A DAY BEFORE THEY

3959
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
GO ON HOLIDAY BREAK, WHY WOULD

3960
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:45,000
YOU DO THAT?

3961
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:48,000
>> THAT'S THE POINT.

3962
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:49,000
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO WASTE

3963
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:50,000
ANY TIME.

3964
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
YOU CAN DRAW TRAJECTORIES

3965
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:53,000
BETWEEN THE ESTABLISHING OF

3966
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:56,000
NORMALCY AND LONG-TERM OUT COME.

3967
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:57,000
THE QUICKER YOU ESTABLISH THAT

3968
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
NORMALCY THE BETTER IN TERMS OF

3969
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:00,000
LONG-TERM OUT COME.

3970
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
A QUICK FRAME OF REFERENCE,

3971
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
COLUMBINE HAPPENED IN APRIL SO

3972
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
NEAR THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR.

3973
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:07,000
THEY KEPT THE SCHOOL CLOSE AND

3974
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
DIDN'T OPEN UNTIL AFTER THE

3975
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:10,000
SUMMER BRICK IN AUGUST.

3976
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
THAT WAS A DECISION MADE IN

3977
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
COLORADO AT THAT TIME.

3978
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:15,000
EVERY COMMUNITY WILL HANDLE IT

3979
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:18,000
DIFFERENTLY.
THOSE ARE OLDER KIDS, BUT THE

3980
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:21,000
SOONER THE BETTER.
>> THE PARENTS WILL FEEL ANXIOUS

3981
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:22,000
AS WELL.

3982
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:23,000
THEY SAY DR. GUPTA, WHAT SHOULD

3983
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
WE DO.

3984
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
>> YOUNG KIDS AND DIFFERENT THAN

3985
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
OTHER SITUATIONS.

3986
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:30,000
THIS IS THE SITUATION IN SOME

3987
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:33,000
WAYS, CHECK YOUR FEELINGS FIRST.

3988
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
YOU WILL FEEL ANXIOUS AND THE

3989
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
KEY THEY KEEP HEARING IS NOT TO

3990
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
INCUMBER A CHILD THAT YOU TRY TO

3991
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:42,000
PROVIDE SUPPORT WITH WITH YOUR

3992
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
FEELINGS.
IT'S TOUGH AND PROBABLY EASIER

3993
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
SAID THAN DONE, BUT MAKING SURE

3994
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
YOU LISTEN AND YOU FILL IN

3995
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:49,000
DETAILS AS APPROPRIATE.

3996
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:50,000
LET THEM DO TALKING.

3997
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
INSTEAD OF SAYING I WILL TELL

3998
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
YOU EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED,

3999
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
DON'T DO THAT.
FIND OUT WHAT THEY KNOW.

4000
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
THEY WILL PROBABLY KNOW THINGS

4001
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:01,000
THAW DON'T REALIZE THEY KNOW.

4002
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
>> SOME PARENTS WILL SAY TO A

4003
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:07,000
DOCTOR, I THINK I NEED

4004
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:08,000
MEDICATION.
WHAT DO THEY DO?

4005
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
>> SOMETIMES IT'S NECESSARY.

4006
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
WE HAVE TALKED ENOUGH ABOUT THIS

4007
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
THAT I'M NOT SOMEONE WHO

4008
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
ADVOCATES THAT REGULARLY, BUT

4009
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:17,000
SLEEP IS SUCH A KEY.

4010
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:20,000
PARRA ARE IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP IF

4011
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
YOU ARE SO NERVOUS, YOU GIVE

4012
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
THEM AMBIEN OR MEDICATION TO

4013
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:25,000
HELP THEM SLEEP.

4014
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
>> ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION OR

4015
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:28,000
SLEEPING MEDICATION AND

4016
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
SOMETIMES THAT IS NECESSARY FOR

4017
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:34,000
THE ADULTS.
SOMETIMES FOR KIDS AS WELL.

4018
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
IF YOU CAN GET THESE CHILDREN

4019
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
GOOD SLEEP ESPECIALLY IN THE

4020
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
EARLY NIGHTS, IT'S VERY, VERY

4021
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
IMPORTANT.
MEDICATION HOPEFULLY IS NOT

4022
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:43,000
NECESSARY BECAUSE THESE ARE

4023
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:46,000
POWERFUL MEDS ESPECIALLY FOR THE

4024
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:47,000
YOUNG CHILDREN.

4025
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:48,000
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU

4026
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:49,000
ADDRESS THAT.

4027
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
>> SANJAY, THANKS VERY, VERY

4028
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
MUCH AND THANKS FOR EVERYTHING

4029
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:54,000
YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING OUR

4030
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:55,000
VIEWERS AS WELL.

4031
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:59,000
THE MAN WHO KNEW THE LANZA

4032
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:00,000
FAMILY SAID NANCY LANZA PICKED

4033
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:03,000
UP THE GUN HOBBY RECENTLY.

4034
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:04,000
HE IS STANDING BY TO JOIN US

4035
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:09,000
NEXT.

4036
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
>>> ERIN BURNETT IS HERE WITH ME

4037
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:00,000
IN CONNECTICUT AS WELL.

4038
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK TODAY

4039
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:06,000
WITH FOLKS WHO ACTUALLY KNEW THE

4040
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:07,000
SHOOTER'S MOTHER?

4041
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
>> YES, A RESTAURANT CALLED "MY

4042
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:10,000
PLACE" WHICH YOU MAY HAVE SEEN

4043
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
DRIVING AROUND IN ONE OF THE

4044
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
MALLS.
IT'S SORT OF A LOCAL JOINT.

4045
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
SHE WENT THERE TWO TO THREE

4046
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:19,000
TIMES A WEEK TO GET TAKE-OUT,

4047
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:20,000
SOMETIMES TO GET A BEER, AND SHE

4048
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:23,000
GOT TO KNOW THE FAMILY WHO OWNS

4049
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
IT.
THE FAMILY SAID SHE WAS

4050
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
GENEROUS, HOW FUNNY SHE WAS.

4051
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
SHE WAS THE PERSON WHO AT A BAR

4052
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
WHO WOULD BE TELLING A STORY

4053
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:34,000
ABOUT SOMETHING WAS WRONG IN

4054
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:35,000
THEIR LIFE AND SHE WOULD SAY,
HERE'S SOME MONEY.

4055
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:39,000
I ASKED IF SHE EVER TALKED ABOUT

4056
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:40,000
HER GUN LHOBBY.

4057
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
THEY SAID, YES, SHE HAD.

4058
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD IS

4059
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:47,000
SHE WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT GUNS,

4060
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:48,000
SHE COLLECTED GUNNED.

4061
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU KNEW ABOUT

4062
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
OR WERE SURPRISED WHEN YOU

4063
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
HEARD?
>> I WOULD SAY IN THE LAST THREE

4064
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:57,000
OR SO YEARS SHE PICKED UP THE

4065
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:58,000
HOBBY.

4066
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
SHE REALLY ENJOYED IT.

4067
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
SHE PROBABLY HAD SOME GUNS SHE

4068
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:03,000
USED TO TAKE TO THE RANGE AND

4069
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:04,000
PRACTICE WITH.

4070
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:05,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE OWNED OR

4071
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:06,000
WHAT SHE HAD.

4072
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF SHE TOOK HER

4073
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
SON, DIDN'T TAKE HER SON.

4074
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
SHE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT THAT

4075
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:13,000
MUCH.
I TOOK IT UP, IT'S FUN.

4076
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
THAT KIND OF THING.

4077
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
>> GIVEN YOU KNEW HER AS A

4078
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:20,000
PERSON, IS SHE THE KIND OF

4079
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:21,000
PERSON TO HAVE GUNS AROUND THE

4080
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:22,000
HOUSE, WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN

4081
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
LOCKED UP?
>> THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN LOCKED

4082
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:25,000
UP.
>> FAR TOO BRIGHT FOR THAT.

4083
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
VERY SMART.

4084
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:31,000
>> THE QUESTION ABOUT THE GUNS,

4085
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
WOLF, WHY SHE HAD THEM, WHY SHE

4086
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
WOULD TAKE HER SON TO A SHOOTING

4087
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:36,000
RANGE, THOSE ARE QUESTIONS WE

4088
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
DON'T HAVE SKWRS TO, BUT WE'RE

4089
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
STARTING TO GET MORE COLOR ON

4090
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:41,000
WHO SHE WAS AND WHY SHE LIKED

4091
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:42,000
WHAT SHE LIKED?

4092
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
>> WE'LL HAVE MORE AT THE TOP OF

4093
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:45,000
THE HOUR AS WELL.

4094
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:48,000
>> WE'LL BE TALKING WITH OTHER

4095
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:53,000
NEIGHBORS.
ONE WOMAN WHOSE 11-YEAR-OLD

4096
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
DAUGHT
DAUGHTER, HER FRIEND LOST HER

4097
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
TWO SIBLINGS.

4098
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:58,000
>> IT'S A HARD STORY TO COVER.

4099
02:52:58,000 --> 02:52:59,000
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

4100
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:00,000
>> IT'S HARD.

4101
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
YOU SEE THE HOLE AND THEN YOU

4102
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000

IN THE TOWN.

4106
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
IT'S HARD TO DO OUR JOB.

4107
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
>> PEOPLE COME UP TO US AND WANT

4108
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000

02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:15,000
