00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
WHY ARE THEY IMPORTANT?

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
CAROLINA LIKE RABBITS MULTIPLY.

45
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
AND IT'S A STABLE FOOD.

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
IT WAS ALSO INEXPENSIVE.

47
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
DURING THE DEPRESSION

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
YEARS, ESPECIALLY IN
EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000

MEAT AND COLLARD GREENS

53
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
THE WHOLE FAMILY;
BISQUITS, CORN BREAD,

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
COLLARD GREENS, SWEET POTATOES.

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
WAS PRETTY STABLE FAIR
FOR A LOT OF FOLKS.

57
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
MY PARENTS INCLUDED.

58
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
THE RECIPE FRED IS COOKING

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
UP FOR US TODAY CALLS FOR

60
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
FROST BITTEN CABBAGE GREENS.

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
ONE OF THE CRITICAL

62
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
SECRETS FRED'S MOTHER
SLOWLY GAVE UP OVER 20 YEARS.

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
FRED'S JOURNEY TO LEARN EVERY

64
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
ASPECT OF HOW TO COOK

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
HIS MOTHERS COLLARDS TOOK

66
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
A LOT OF TIME.

67
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
AND PICKING UP THE RIGHT

68
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
COLLARDS IS ANOTHER CRUCIAL STEP
IN MAKING THIS FAMILY RECIPE.

69
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
NOW OK WE'RE HERE,

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
OK WHAT KIND OF
COLLARDS ARE THESE?

71
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
THESE ARE CABBAGE
COLLARDS.

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
CABBAGE I FEEL LIKE I'M

73
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
LIKE AT THE CABBAGE PATCH

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
LAND WAITING FOR IT TO

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
OPEN UP AND A BABY'S HEAD
I WAS GOING TO PICK THE

76
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
CABBAGE PATCH DOLL UP.

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
THIS IS LIKE ONE...

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
YEAH PICK IT UP, PICK IT UP.

79
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
GOING TO COOK.

81
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
AND TO ME THIS IS THE

82
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
BEST WAY, THIS THE WAY MY
MOTHER TAUGHT ME TO DO IT

83
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
WAS TO FIND THE WHOLE

84
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
HEAD AND WORK DOWN
FROM THE WHOLE HEAD.

85
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
NOW THE OTHER THING IS

86
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
IMPORTANT IS THEY GOT
TO BE FROST BITTEN.

87
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
FROST BITTEN?

88
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
KYLE, HOW DOES THAT WORK WITH
THE FROST BITTEN?

89
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
KYLES GRANDDADDY

90
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
BEEN GROWING
COLLARDS FOREVER SO.

91
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I GREW UP IN AADDY

92
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
FAMILY AND MY GRANDDADDY
WE ALL CALLED HIM PAPA

93
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
PAUL HAS GROWN CABBAGE

94
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
AND COLLARDS AS LONG
AS I'VE BEEN ALIVE.

95
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
AND HE WOULD NEVER, EVER PICK

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
COLLARDS OUT OF HIS PATCH TILL

97
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
AFTER WE HAD OUR FIRST FROST.

98
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
IT FEELS LIKE RIGHT NOW ITS LIKE

99
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
WE HAD OUR FIRST FROST RIGHT NO,

100
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
YEAH WE'VE HAD A FROST

101
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
THINGS ARE GOING

102
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
TO BE FINE.

103
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
OKAY.

104
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
NOW COLLARD GREENS
CAN BE VERY INTIMIDATING

105
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
WHEN YOU FIRST SEE THEM.

106
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THE IDEA OF COOKING A

107
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
PLANT THE SIZE OF A
VOLKSWAGON JETTA CAN SEEM

108
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
A LITTLE DAUNTING BUT
FRED AND KYLE ASSURE

109
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
ME IT'S A SNAP.

110
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
NOW AFTER WE FINISH UP OUTSIDE
THE BOYS TOOK US INSIDE TO GRAB

111
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
ANOTHER IMPORTANT INGREDIENT.

112
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
ALRIGHT FIRST I'M
GOING TO ASK YOU, WHAT

113
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
EXACTLY IS HOCKS PORK?

114
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I KNOW IT'S FROM

115
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
A PIG BUT WHERE?

116
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
WHAT ITEM DO YOU USE?

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
YOU NEED TO THINK

118
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
ABOUT THIS SMOKED
PORK OSSO BUCO.

119
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
GOT YOU.

120
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
OKAY.

121
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
ITS THAT PART OF THE PIG.

122
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
OKAY.
ITS REALLY KIND OF

123
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
A CRITICAL THING.

124
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
THESE WERE THE TYPE OF THINGS

125
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
THAT WHEN MY MOM WAS COMING UP

126
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
THEY COULDN'T SELL THIS.

127
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
THEY RAISED HOGS.

128
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
THEY COULDN'T SELL THEM.

129
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
BUT THEY COULD SELL THE
TENDERLOINS AND THE RIBS

130
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
AND ALL THAT RIGHT?

131
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
PEOPLE IN RURAL NORTH CAROLINA
THIS IS WHAT THEY ATE AND THIS S

132
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
WHAT THEY USE TO SEASON.

133
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
WITH OUR GREENS IN THE CAR

134
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
AND FRESH IN HOCK IN HAND

135
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
IT WAS TIME TO HEAD HOME

136
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
WITH FRED AND KYLE TO

137
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
START COOKING THE FAMILY

138
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
RECIPE FOR COLLARD GREENS.

139
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
FRED LIVES JUST NORTH OF
RALEIGH IN A GREAT

140
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
NEIGHBORHOOD SURROUNDED BY

141
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
CAROLINA PINE FORREST.

142
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
NOW HE'S MADE FOOD HIS

143
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
PASSION AND CAREER OVER 20

144
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
YEARS AND HAS WRITTEN TOP

145
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
SELLING COOK BOOKS ON
SOUTHERN FOODS AND DRINKS.

146
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
MORE THAN ANYTHING COLLARD

147
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
GREENS HAVE BECOME A

148
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
CONNECTION TO MY MOTHER,

149
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
TO MY FATHER, TO THEIR

150
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
PAST, TO THEIR HISTORY AND
THE HISTORY OF THE SOUTH.

151
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
COLLARD GREENS ARE
THE KIND OF THE CENTER

152
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
OF THE PLATE THING.

153
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
THEY BRING PEOPLE

154
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
TO THE TABLE.

155
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
THROUGH THE TABLE I THINK

156
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
YOU SOLVE PROBLEMS.

157
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'VE OFTEN SAID THAT IF WE

158
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
COULD SIT DOWN AND HAVE A
GOOD MEAL WITH SOME OF OUR

159
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
ENEMIES WE'D BE OKAY.

160
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
BECAUSE NOBODY'S REALLY
PISSED OFF WHEN THEY'RE

161
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
EATING GOOD FOOD.

162
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
AS WE FOUND OUT FRED'S

163
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
KITCHEN WAS KIND OF SMALL
BUT IT WAS WELL EQUIPED

164
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
FOR GOURMET COOKING.

165
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
AND THE FIRST STEP IN
GETTING HIS MOTHER'S

166
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
RECIPE FOR COLLARDS GREENS

167
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
GOING IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION STARTS WITH

168
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
AN INGREDIENT THAT'S

169
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
IMPORTANT IN A LOT
OF SOUTHERN MEALS.

170
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
BACON.

171
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
ALRIGHT SO WE HAVE

172
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
THE COLLARD GREENS
BUT THESE ARE HUGE.

173
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
HOW DO WE BREAK

174
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
THESE DOWN?

175
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
WHAT DO WE DO?

176
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
WE JUST THROW THIS
IN A POT LIKE THIS?

177
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I MEAN IS IT THIS HUGE?

178
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
YOU DON'T HAVE A POT

179
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
BIG ENOUGH DO YOU?

180
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
NO.

181
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
MAYBE MY RELATIVES DID.

182
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
WE NEED TO FIND HIM A POT.

183
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
OBVIOUSLY IT'S ABOUT THE

184
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
ONLY PEOPLE THAT WOULD

185
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
HAVE A POT THIS BIG.

WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT

190
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
IN ANY SHAPE, FORM AT ALL.

211
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
EVERYTHING GOES GOOD
WITH BACON I THINK.

212
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000

213
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000

FOR MANY YEARS.

235
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
THE POT LIQUOR
IS A BIG PART OF HOW TO

236
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
MAKE THESE GREENS SINK.

237
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
NOW AFTER RENDERING DOWN

238
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
SOME BACON FAT FRED ADDED
THE NEXT INGREDIENT TO THE MIX.

239
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
THE NEXT THING WE'RE GOING

240
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO
PUT SOME CHOPPED ONIONS IN HERE.

241
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
SO THIS IS KIND OF LIKE IF

242
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I WERE TO MAKE FOR ME LIKE
I SAID I'M ITALIAN TALKING

243
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
ABOUT THE POT, BUT IF I

244
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
WERE TO MAKE SOMETHING I'D
USUALLY PUT EXTRA VIRGIN

245
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
OLIVE OIL, BUT FOR YOU
IT'S THE BACON FAT.

246
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
IT'S THE BACON.
THAT'S KIND OF

247
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
LIKE THE OIL.

248
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
NOW HERE'S SOMETHING
YOU GET HOME AND YOU

249
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
WANT TO TRY THIS.

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
TAKE SOME PANCETTA.

251
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
YOU CAN PUT PANCETTA IN HERE

252
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
WITH A LITTLE OLIVE OIL AND

253
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
IT'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

254
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
AND I DO THAT ON OCCASIONS

255
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
JUST TO SORT OF CHANGE IT
UP A LITTLE BIT.

256
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
AND LIKE EVERY GOOD
ITALIAN KNOWS WE'RE GOING

257
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000

258
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
WE DON'T WANT TO

259
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000

HE DOES, HE DOES.

322
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
LITTLE QUICK AT LEARNING.

323
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
EVEN THE SMALL ONES

324
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
AS YOU GO DOWN TOO.
EXACTLY.

325
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
BECAUSE THESE ARE THE
SWEETER ONES AREN'T THEY.

326
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
EXACTLY.

327
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
WHEN YOU SHUT THE KNOTS ON THEM
IT'S KIND OF LIKE ROLLING A JOIT

328
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
AND THEN CUTTING THEM UP.

329
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
GOT YOU.

330
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
IF YOU GROW UP IN THE 70'S

331
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
ANY TIME PAST THE 70'S IT'S

332
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
EASY TO DO CHEF OBLIVIA.

333
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000

DOING PERFECT.

337
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
IT'S ALMOST LIKE WHAT
YOU DOING WITH THE BAY

338
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
LEAVES OR WHATEVER.

339
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
OR LIKE THE BASIL LEAVES.

340
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
YOU ROLL THEM UP.

341
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
EXACTLY.

342
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'M NOT FAMILIAR

343
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
WITH THE JOINT BUT.

344
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
AFTER GETTING INTO IT I CAN SEE
WORKING WITH COLLARD GREENS

345
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
WASN'T ALL THAT BAD.

346
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I MEAN ONCE WE GOT THEM CLEANED

347
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
UP, REMOVE THE STEMS AND CUT THM

348
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
DOWN INTO SMALLER PIECES

349
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
THEY'RE READY TO ADD TO

350
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
THE POT LIQUOR FOR A SLOW AND

351
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
LOW RISE ON THE STOVE.

352
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
ALRIGHT JOEY THE NEXT THING

353
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING

354
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
TO COOK THESE SUCKERS.

355
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
AND ONE OF THE THINGS I

356
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
DID WHILE YOU WERE OVER

357
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000

OKAY.

360
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
SO THAT'S GOT TO GO IN
THERE RIGHT BEFORE IT

361
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
STARTS TO GET TO A BOIL?

362
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
RIGHT BEFORE IT

363
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000

WE'RE COOKING UP COLLARD GREENS
IN NORTH CAROLINA WITH FOOD

415
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
AUTHOR AND CHEF FRED THOMPSON.

416
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
FRED'S MOTHER WAS SLOW

417
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
TO GIVE UP HER RECIPE FOR

418
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
THE FAMILY DISH TO FRED.

419
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
MAKING HIM WORK FOR

420
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
OVER 20 YEARS TO GET
EVERY SECRET STEP.

421
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
NOW AFTER GETTING THE
GREENS CHOPPED UP AND PUT

422
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
INTO THE POT LIQUOR WE'RE

423
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
ALMOST READY FOR THE LOW

424
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
AND SLOW COOKING TO BEGIN.

425
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
SO WE'VE GOT
EVERYTHING IN THE POT.

426
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
WE'RE DONE.

427
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000

00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
THEM ALL IN THERE.

430
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
YOU DID.

431
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
LET'S PUT A LITTLE BLACK

432
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
PEPPER IN THERE, IT'S
FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER.

433
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
SPRINKLE THOSE...THE LITTLE

434
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
FINALE BEFORE WE ACTUALLY GET TO
RELEASE IT THERE.

435
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
ALRIGHT.

436
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
WE'RE GOING TO

437
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
COVER THEM UP.

438
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
LET'S GO GET A BEER BECAUSE
ABOUT TWO HOURS THEY'LL BE DONE

439
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
BUT WE GOT TIME TO HAVE A BEER.

440
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
THAT'S SOUNDS
GOOD LET'S DO IT.

441
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
NOW FOR MANY PEOPLE IN

442
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
THE SOUTH COLLARD GREENS
WERE AN IMPORTANT PART OF

443
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
SURVIVING THE
GREAT DEPRESSION.

444
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I MEAN THEY GREW LIKE

445
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
CRAZY HERE IN NORTH
CAROLINA AND COULD EASILY

446
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
FEED FAMILIES HIT
BY A TOUGH TIMES.

447
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
FRED'S MOTHER HELD THE
SECRET TO THIS DELICIOUS

448
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
RECIPE FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

449
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
SLOWLY REVEALING THE
IMPORTANT PARTS OF

450
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
IT TO FRED OVERTIME.

451
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
FOR MY MOTHER THIS HAS BEEN SORT

452
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
OF AN INTERESTING JOURNEY AND

453
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
INTERESTING TRIP WITH HER.

454
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
TAKING LITERALLY

455
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
20 YEARS TO GET THE
RECIPE OUT OF HER.

456
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
GIVING ME SO MANY EXCUSES
TO BE AROUND HER, BE WITH

457
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
HER AND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

458
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
LIFE WAS LIKE
GROWING UP FOR HER.

459
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
COOKING COLLARD GREENS
RIGHT TAKES TIME.

460
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I MEAN IT TAKES A COUPLE OF

461
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
HOURS FOR THE LEAVES TO BREAK

462
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
DOWN IN THE POT LIQUOR WITH THIS

463
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
RECIPE AS THEY SLOWLY SUCK UP
ALLTHE SMOKEY FLAVORS OF THE HAM

464
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
HOCK, BACON, ONIONS AND GARLIC.

465
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
COOKING TRADITIONAL
MEALS LIKE THIS IS

466
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
ALWAYS SPECIAL FOR FRED.

467
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
AND USING SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT

468
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
HIS MOTHER USED

469
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
TO ACTUALLY PREPARE THE DISH
REALLY BRINGS IT HOME.

470
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
ALRIGHT SO THIS
SMELLS ABSOLUTELY

471
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
GREAT RIGHT NOW.

472
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
SO ARE WE READY TO EAT?

473
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
YOU REMEMBER
THE MONSTROSITY
THAT WE STARTED.

474
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
RIGHT?
AND THEN YOU WEREN'T

475
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
CERTAIN THAT I WOULD GET

476
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
THEM SMALL IN THE POT.

477
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
RIGHT AND YOU DID.

478
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
ALRIGHT NOW THIS IS MAYBE

479
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
A LITTLE SURPRISE THAT'S
WHAT THEY'VE COOKED DOWN TO.

480
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
OKAY.

481
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS

482
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
DO A COUPLE OF
BATCHES AT ONE TIME.

483
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
RIGHT.

484
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
AND NOW YOU JUST
WANT TO EAT THEM.

485
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
ONE OF THE LAST TRICKS
THAT MY MOTHER TOLD ME

486
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS WAS
SHE CHOPPED HOW TO KNOW

487
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
HOW THIS COLLARD CHOPPER

488
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
IS BECAUSE THIS WAS THE

489
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
BIGGEST FIGHT WHEN SHE

490
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
DECIDED TO BREAK UP
HOUSEKEEPING AND CLEAR THE

491
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
RETIREMENT CENTER.

492
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
WE GOT THE CHOPPER.

493
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
AT THAT TIME I COOKED

494
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
MORE THAN MY SISTER DID.

495
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
SO YOU GOT IT?

496
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I GOT THE CHOPPER.

497
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I COULD SELL THIS TO MY SISTER
FOR A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY BUT

498
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

499
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
RIGHT.

500
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

501
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
AND THIS IS MY MOMS BOWL.
OH REALLY?

502
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
OH COOL.
IT ACTUALLY WAS

503
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
HER MOTHERS BOWL.

504
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
HER MOTHER USED IT TO

505
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
MAKE BISQUITS OUT OF IT.

506
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
SO HOW OLD WOULD YOU
SAY THAT BOWL IS THEN?

507
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
WE'RE LOOKING AT CLOSE
TO 100 YEARS OLD.

508
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
WOW.
FRED AND KYLE HAVE

509
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
PEFECTED A GREAT WAY TO
ENJOY THESE GREENS, THAT A

510
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LOVE.

511
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
AS THE GREENS COOK DOWN
KYLE GOT THE GRILL READY

512
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
AND SEASONED SOME FAT NEW

513
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
YORK STEAKS TO SERVE

514
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
OVER THE GREENS.

515
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
AFTER THE COLLARDS HAVE

516
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
COME OUT AND ARE STRAINED
FOR THE SHINING PART OF

517
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
THE RECIPE FRED BREAKS

518
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
DOWN THE MEATY HAM HOCK
TO ADD BACK INTO THE POT.

519
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
ALRIGHT JOEY I'M
GOING TO GIVE THEM

520
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
A LITTLE QUICK TEST.

521
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
BUT SINCE YOU'RE NOT
AROUND HERE I'M GOING TO

522
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
LET YOU TASTE A LITTLE

523
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
QUICK TEST AND WE'RE
GOING TO DECIDE HOW

524
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
MUCH SALT WE NEED.

525
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
GET A LITTLE
SWEET AND SOUR?

526
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I DON'T THINK I

527
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
WOULD CHANGE IT.
YEAH.

528
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
WELL I THINK THEY

529
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
GET TOO MUCH SALT.
WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING

530
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
YEAH OBVIOUSLY WHEN THAT

531
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
SEASON HAS SALT IN IT.

532
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I THINK IT'S PERFECT.

533
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
SO I'LL SHOW YOU THE OLD

534
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
FASHIONED WAY OF EATING
COLLARD GREENS AND THEN

535
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
WE'LL DO SOME UP A
LITTLE BIT WITH A STEAK.

536
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
ALRIGHT.

537
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
COMING UP NETE UP FRED'S AMAZINE

538
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
TO PLATE UP FRED'S AMAZING
COLLARD GREENS OVER STEAK.

539
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
AND WE GET A TASTE OF SOME HOME

540
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
BREW THAT WILL DEFINITELY PUT A

541
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
LITTLE SKIP IN YOUR STEP.
WHEN MY FAMILY RECIPE

542
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
ROCKS RETURNS.

543
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
WE HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME

544
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
MEETING FRED AND KYLE
IN NORTH CAROLINA.

545
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
AND LEARING THE TRADITIONS

546
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
OF SOUTHERN COOKING.

547
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
THE LAST STEP IN THIS

548
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
RECIPE IS AN UNUSUAL ONE

549
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
BUT IT WAS TOP SECRET TILL

550
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
FRED'S MOM FINALLY

551
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
GAVE IT UP.

552
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
ALRIGHT REMEMBER WE TALKED
ABOUT THE SHINE WHICH WAS

553
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
ONE OF THE VERY CRITICAL

554
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
THINGS THAT MY MOM

555
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
JUST REALLY LEFT OUT.

556
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
WELL WHAT THE SHINE IS,

557
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
IS THIS STUFF THAT COMES
TO THE TOP OF YOUR POT LIQUOR.

558
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
AND HOW DOES THAT

559
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
GET LIKE THAT?

560
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
HOW DOES IT FORM?

561
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
WELL IT JUST AFTER IT SITS

562
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES THE
STUFF COMES UP TO THE TOP

563
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
OR YOU CAN STICK INTO THE

564
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
REFRIGERATOR REAL QUICK
AND THIS IS THE MAGIC STUFF.

565
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
AND YOU JUST KIND OF WORK

566
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
THIS IN AND BELIEVE IT OR

567
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
NOT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A

568
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
WHOLE LOT BUT IT PUTS IN
A WHOLE LOT OF FLAVOR.

569
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
AND KYLE YOU
GROWED THIS RIGHT?

570
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
KYLE IS THE KING OF MEAT.

571
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH THE SEASONING?

572
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
WHAT DID YOU PUT ON THERE?

573
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
IT'S JUST SALT AND PEPPER.
SALT AND PEPPER?

574
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
DON'T GO CRAZY WITH

575
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
THE STEAKS LET THE

576
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
MEAT SHINE THROUGH.
I LIKE THAT.

577
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
