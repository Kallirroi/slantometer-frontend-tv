1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
WEEK.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
ALL THAT, "HOT TOPICS" AND MORE

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
COMING UP ON "THE VIEW."

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
>> SO HELLO AND WELCOME TO "THE

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
VIEW."

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
YOU KNOW, THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
BEYOND HEARTBROKEN AFTER THIS

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
TRAGIC MASSACRE IN NEWTOWN,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
CONNECTICUT, AND THAT IS JUST

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
ALMOST TOO AWFUL TO COMPREHEND.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE WITH YOU GUYS

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
WITH THE KIDS, WITH LITTLE ONES,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
HOW YOU -- HOW YOU'RE TALKING

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
ABOUT IT OR ARE YOU TALKING

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
ABOUT IT.
>> WE WERE TEXTING BACK AND

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
FORTH ABOUT IT.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
WHAT DID YOU END UP DOING WITH

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
JEFFREY?
>> WELL, THE PRINCIPAL AT

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
JEFFREY'S SCHOOL SENT US AN

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
E-MAIL AND SAID BECAUSE IT'S SO

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
YOUNG KEEP THE TVs OFF AND

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
SHIELD THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
IF THEY WERE UNAWARE THEN IT WAS

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
UP TO US AND I FELT FOR JEFFREY,

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
HE WAS NOT AWARE OF WHAT WAS

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
GOING ON AND I CHOSE NOT TO PUT

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
MY ISSUES ON HIM SO I CHOSE NOT

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
TO TELL JEFFREY ANYTHING.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
>> BUT HE MIGHT HEAR ABOUT IT,

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
THOUGH.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
>> WE KEPT THE TV OFF BUT HE

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
HEARD ABOUT IT ONE TIME WHEN HE

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
WAS WATCHING THE KNICKS GAME AND

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
GAVE A MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
SANDY HOOK VICTIMS AND HE SAID,

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
MOM
MOMMY, I THOUGHT SANDY WAS OVER.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
>> HOW ABOUT YOU?

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
>> LIKE YOU SAID, I THINK

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
EVERYONE WAS IN A REALLY SAD

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
PLACE OF GRIEVING.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
IT'S HARD.
AS A PARENT YOU NEED TO BE

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
STRONG FOR YOUR KIDS.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
WE HAD A GOOD FRIEND TELL US

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
WHEN HIS DAUGHTER WAS TALKING

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
ABOUT COLUMBINE SHE WAS ASKING

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
DETAILS.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
HE SAID, HONEY, WHEN WE TRAVEL

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
THROUGH THE AIRPORT DO I ASK YOU

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
TO CARRY THE HEAVIEST BAG AND

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
SHE SAID, NO.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
HE SAID, I DON'T ASK YOU TO

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
CARRY THE HEAVIEST BAG BECAUSE

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
THAT'S MY JOB AS YOUR FATHER.

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'LL TAKE THE HEAVIEST AND YOU

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
TAKE THE ONE YOU CAN HANDLE.

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I WENT WITH THAT.

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
EVERY CHILD IS DIFFERENT.

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
WE'RE NOT TRAINED WHAT TO DO IN

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
THIS SITUATION AND I TRIED TO

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
GIVE GRACE ONE MORE DAY OF NOT

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
KNOWING.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I THOUGHT SHE'D FIND OUT FROM US

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
OR SOMEBODY ELSE.

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
SOMETIMES THEY GET INFORMATION

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
BEFORE YOU DO AND A FRIEND DID

68
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
TELL HER DETAILED INFORMATION, A

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
FRIEND OF HERS TOLD HER DETAILED

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
INFORMATION THAT WOULD NOT HAVE

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
BEEN THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION I

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
WOULD HAVE GIVEN HER,

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
NONETHELESS, I THINK WE HAD A

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
SOULFUL DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
HAPPENED.
>> WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
>> SHE WAS VERY SAD.

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I MEAN VERY SAD.

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
>> DID YOU TELL HER THERE WAS A

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
BAD MAN?

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN TO A CHILD

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
THIS KIND OF EVIL ESPECIALLY

82
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE LIST

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
OF CHILDREN, ONE OF THE CHILDREN

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
WAS NAMED GRACE AND I THOUGHT,

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
WHAT IS ELISABETH GOING TO SAY.

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
>> YOU KNOW, WELL, FIRST OF ALL

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
CHRIS CUOMO WHO IS HERE TODAY

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
THANKFULLY AND I HAD A GREAT

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
DISCUSSION AND HE SAID, LOOK,

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
WE'RE OKAY, SO YOU CAN'T GET

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
HEAVY LIKE YOU WOULD IF IT WERE

92
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
YOUR DIRECT SITUATION, BUT I

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, I TOLD

94
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
HER, LOOK, THIS WAS WAS A MAN

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
WITH A SICK MIND AND A SICK

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
HEART AND HE DID AN EVIL THING,

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
VERY EVIL THING.

98
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
IT'S OVER.

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
HE'S GONE.

100
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
YOU'RE SAFE.

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
YOU CAN -- TWO THINGS I WOULD

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
ASK, THOUGH BECAUSE I THINK KIDS

103
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

104
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
INFORMATION.

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
AS I SAID GRACE IS PRIVY TO SOME

106
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THAT I DON'T THINK WAS

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
APPROPRIATE FOR HER MIND AND

108
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
HEART.

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
ONE IF YOU'RE TALKING TO THEM

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
ABOUT IT, TELL THEM IT'S FAMILY

111
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
TALK OR IF THEY WANT TO TALK TO

112
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
YOU THEY CAN TALK TO YOU OR

113
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
FAMILY OR TEACHERS.

114
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
IT'S NOT RECESS TALK AND THEY

115
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
HAVE THE OPTION TO SAY IF IT

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
COMES UP IN THOSE SOCIAL AREAS

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
AND DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THEY CAN SAY CAN WE CHANGE THE

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
SUBJECT?

120
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
LET THEM HAVE A LITTLE

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
CONTROVERSY OVER WHAT'S IN THEIR

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
MIND.

123
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
>> GO YOU GO AHEAD.

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
>> THERE WAS A THING ON THE

125
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
INTERNET THAT MR. ROGERS WHEN HE

126
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
WAS AROUND SAID TO CHILDREN,

127
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
WHEN THINGS ARE BAD FIND THE

128
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
HELPERS.

129
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
>> YES, WE TALKED ABOUT THAT.

130
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
>> I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY GOOD

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
ADVICE.
THE ADULTS NEED TO FIND

132
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
SOLUTIONS AND THE CHILDREN NEED

133
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
TO FIND HELPERS.

134
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
>> ONCE OF THE THINGS LAST

135
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
NIGHT, ONE OF THE PERSONS --

136
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
OBAMA CAME TO THE SERVICES IN

137
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
NEWTOWN, AND HE HAS BEEN -- FROM

138
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
THE TILE THIS HAPPENED HE HAS

139
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
BEEN ONE OF THE HELPERS AND

140
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
CONSOLERS BUT THEY HAD ALL OF

141
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
THE DIFFERENT AND ROGGE US

142
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
LEADERS, THE RABBIS AND MUSLIMS

143
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
AND PROSS STANTES AND SO FORTH.

144
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
EACH OF THEM FROM THAT TOWN,

145
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
EACH OF THEM SO I THOUGHT

146
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
SPECIAL AND ARTICULATE AND IT

147
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
WAS AN OPPORTUNITY NO MATTER

148
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
WHAT YOUR RELIGION TO SEE HOW

149
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
EACH OF THEM HANDLED IT AND HOW

150
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
EACH OF THEM GAVE SOLACE.

151
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I THOUGHT THEY WERE REMARKABLE

152
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
AND IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT PART

153
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
OF BRINGING EVERYONE TOGETHER TO

154
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
SEE THAT IT AFFECTED EVERYONE.

155
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
>> TIMES WHEN RELIGION HAS A

156
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
PART IN EVERYBODY'S LIFE WHETHER

157
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
YOU'RE AN ATHEIST OR NOT JUST

158
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO ANSWERS TO

159
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
THESE KIND OF QUESTIONS AND IT'S

160
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
THE ONE THING YOU CAN -- THEY'RE

161
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
SAYING, SHE'S IN HEAVEN.

162
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
SHE'S IN A BETTER PLACE AND ALL

163
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THAT, MAYBE THAT'S THE

164
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
CONSOLATION.

165
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
>> THAT'S WHAT I GO TO.

166
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
>> THE THING THAT YOU HAVE TO DO

167
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
WITH KIDS IS JUST MY THOUGHT IS

168
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
YOU JUST HAVE TO SAY, YOU KNOW,

169
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT I CAN

170
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
EXPLAIN TO YOU RIGHT NOW AND I

171
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
NEED SOME MORE TIME TO THINK

172
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
ABOUT IT AND WHEN I THINK I CAN

173
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
TELL YOU, THEN WE CAN SIT DOWN.

174
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
>> EACH PARENT HAS THEIR OWN WAY

175
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
OF DEALING WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

176
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
>> SO PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS IN

177
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, YESTERDAY

178
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
AS BARBARA SAID TO LEND HIS

179
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
SUPPORT TO THE GRIEVING FAMILIES

180
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
AND TOWNSPEOPLE.

181
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
TAKE A LOOK.
>> WE GATHER HERE IN MEMORY OF

182
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
20 BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN AND 6

183
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
REMARKABLE ADULTS.

184
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
AS A COMMUNITY YOU'VE INSPIRED

185
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
US, NEWTOWN.

186
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
IN THE FACE OF INDESCRIBABLE

187
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000

>> BECAUSE YOU'RE SHOCKED AND

900
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
YOU'LL TALK ABOUT IT.

901

WHEN SOMEBODY DOES A SHOOTING AT

902
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
THE WORKPLACE, THE NEWS MEDIA

903
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
DOESN'T TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

904
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
BUT IF WE'RE SHOCKED ENOUGH

905
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO ASK, WHO

906
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000

911
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000

912

TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN HIM AND

913
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
