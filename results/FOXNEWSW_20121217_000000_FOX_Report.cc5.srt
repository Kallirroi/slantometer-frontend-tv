1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
YOU KNOW, TO LOOK AT THAT

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
WOMAN, THAT SISTER WHO'S LOST

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
HER SISTER, WHO IS A TEACHER

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
AND TO KNOW THE PRINCIPAL HAS

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
PARENTS, PROBABLY, AND

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
SIBLINGS AND YOU KNOW, WE

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
CAN'T FORGET THE ADULTS AS

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
WELL WHO LOST THEIR LIVES, WHO

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
GAVE THEIR LIVES IN PROTECTION

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
OF THE CHILDREN.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
>> AS WE LOOK BACK INSIDE,

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
GETTING READY FOR THIS, AND

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
OUTSIDE, LINING UP OUTSIDE AND

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
GETTING READY FOR THE SERVICE

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
INSIDE, STEVE, YOUR THOUGHTS

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, DEALING WITH

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
THIS AND IS ALSO THAT, I KNOW

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
YOU SEE SENATOR JOE LIEBERMAN

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
IN LINE AND OBVIOUSLY, HE WAS

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
OUT HERE ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
TALKING ABOUT DEALING WITH

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
THIS AND ALSO, AS YOU

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
MENTIONED, SOMETHING WE TALKED

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
ABOUT, HOLLYWOOD, VIDEO GAMES

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
AND OTHER ASPECTS TO WHAT NINA

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
TALKS ABOUT, THE BROAD,

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
PERHAPS, COMMISSION APPROACH

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
TO A BIGGER PROBLEM.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
>> YEAH, I THINK IF YOU -- IF

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
YOU -- YOU KNOW, BASICALLY

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS BROAD

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
NATIONAL DISCUSSION, I HOPE

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
IT'S BROADER RATHER THAN MORE

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
NARROW, BUT WHAT STRUCK ME

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
FROM THE WORDS FROM ROBBIE

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
PARKER YESTERDAY AS HE

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
REMEMBERED HIS DAUGHTER WHO

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
DIED IN THE SHOOTING WAS THAT

39
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
HE TOOK THE TIME TO REMEMBER

40
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
AND THINK ABOUT THE FAMILY OF

41
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
THE SHOOTER, WHICH I JUST

42
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
FOUND, YOU KNOW, AS A

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
OF A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD,

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
FIVE-YEAR-OLD AND A

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
TWO-YEAR-OLD, TO SEE HIM TAKE

46
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
THAT TIME IN THAT MOMENT AS

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
HE'S TAKING AND REMEMBERING

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
HIS OWN DAUGHTER AND REMEMBER

49
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
THE FAMILY OF THE SHOOTER AND

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
SAY, I'M NOT MAD, I FORGIVE

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
THEM, I'M THINKING ABOUT THEM

52
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
AT THIS TIME WAS JUST AN

53
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL MOMENT,

54
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
AND MAKES HIM, I THINK, A VERY

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
STRONG MAN.

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
>> AND I THINK THAT'S A

57
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
REMARKABLE EXAMPLE OF GRACE IN

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
THE WORLD THAT A FATHER WOULD

59
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
THINK OF THAT.

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
IF I COULD SAY ONE WORD ABOUT

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
THE POLICY, I THINK THE

62
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
NATIONAL COMMISSION IS THE WAY

63
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
TO GO TO TAKE IT OUT OF THE

64
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
MOMENT.

65
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
AND I THINK OF THE -- WHEN I

66
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
MENTIONED THE OTHER DAY THERE

67
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
HAD BEEN THREE ELEMENTS ARE

68
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
THE SHOOTER, THE WEAPON, AND

69
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
THE ENVIRONMENT.

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
AND ALL THREE SHOULD BE GIVEN

71
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
EQUAL PLACE IN ANY INQUIRY,

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
MEANING THE AVAILABILITY OF

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
GUNS, THE QUESTION OF THE

74
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
VIDEO GAME AND THE MOVIE,

75
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
HOLLYWOOD INDUSTRY, WHICH

76
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
DESENSITIZES AND MAKES ALMOST

77
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A GAME OF THE VIOLENCE, I

78
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF WE

79
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
LEARNED THAT THE SHOOTER WAS

80
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
PLAYING GAMES, YOU KNOW, ON

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
HIS OWN IN HIS AUTISTIC WORLD

82
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
AND MANY OF WHICH ARE ABOUT

83
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
MASSACRE, MOWING DOWN PEOPLE

84
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
AND THE THIRD IS, OF COURSE,

85
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SHOOTER.

86
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
AND INTERESTINGLY, EACH OF

87
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
THEM IMPINGES ON A RIGHT, A

88
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT, GUN CONTROL

89
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
ON THE SECOND, THE

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY, FREE

91
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
SPEECH, THE FIRST.

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
AND THE IDEA OF COMMITTING A

93
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
PERSON, THE FIFTH.

94
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
HE SO, THESE ARE REALLY

95
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
ROUNDING ISSUES, VERY DEEP IN

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
OUR LIBERAL, SORT OF

97
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
LIBERTARIAN CULTURE, BUT I

98
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
THINK IF YOU DEAL WITH

99
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH

100
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
ALL THREE AT ONCE.

101
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
>> AND I SHOULD POINT OUT

102
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
YOU'RE LOOKING LIVE AT THE

103
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
AUDITORIUM AT THE NEWTOWN HIGH

104
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
SCHOOL.
ABOUT 900 PEOPLE FIT AND AN

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
OVERFLOW IN THE GYM OF 1300

106
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
AND STAFF AND STUDENTS OF

107
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY ARE

108
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
ACTUALLY IN THE CROWD AND

109
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
THEY'RE WEARING GREEN AND

110
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
WHITE RIBBONS.

111
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THE TOWN'S AND THE SCHOOL'S

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
COLORS WITH A SMALL ANGEL IN

113
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
THE MIDDLE OF THEM.

114
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
WE'RE TOLD THAT THIS SERVICE

115
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
WILL BE DELAYED A BIT BECAUSE

116
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
THE PRESIDENT IS STILL MEETING

117
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
WITH THESE FAMILY MEMBERS AND

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
CLASSROOMS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL.

119
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
AND HE'S TAKING HIS TIME WITH

120
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THESE FAMILIES IN INDIVIDUAL

121
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
CLASSROOMS.

122
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
WE DON'T HAVE A START TIME

123
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
YET.
IT COULD BE POSSIBLY AT THE

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
BOTTOM OF THE HOUR.

125
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
WE DON'T KNOW AS OF YET.

126
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
THEY'LL GIVE US THE BEST CUES

127
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THEY CAN, BUT HE IS MEETING

128
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
WITH THESE--

129
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
WITH THESE FAMILIES ONE BY ONE

130
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
AND ALSO MEETING WITH FIRST

131
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
RESPONDERS.

132
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
AND PICKING UP ON WHAT CHARLES

133
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
SAID.
>> YEAH, I MEAN, I WAS JUST

134
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
GOING TO POINT OUT WHEN YOU

135
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HEROES

136
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
AND HUMAN MOMENTS AND THE

137
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
STORIES THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT

138
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
THESE TEACHERS OVER THE COURSE

139
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
OF THE LAST 24 HOURS.

140
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
>> THE PRINCIPAL AND--

141
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
>> THE PRINCIPAL.

142
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
>> THE PSYCHIATRIST.

143
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
>> AND LOSING THEIR LIVES AND

144
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
TRYING TO PROTECT THE KIDS AND

145
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THEN THERE WERE TEACHERS WHO

146
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
HID IN CLOSETS WITH CHILDREN

147
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
AND GOT THEM TO DRAW TO CALM

148
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THEM DOWN AND ONE TEACHER TOLD

149
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
THEM SHE LOVED THEM, FEARFUL

150
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
THAT THEY WOULD HEAR THAT

151
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
INSTEAD OF THE GUNFIRE.

152
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I MEAN, THESE WERE REALLY

153
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
HEROES IN THE BEST, BEST SENSE

154
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
OF THE WORD.

155
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THOSE ARE THE

156
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
STORIES, GETTING INTO THE

157
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
ROOMS, LOOKING THEM UP.

158
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
SOME TEACHERS PUTTING THEM

159
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
THROUGH WINDOWS SO THEY COULD

160
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
GET OUT IN TIME, KIRSTEN,

161
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
THINKING TO GET THEM, YOU

162
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
KNOW, REALLY WHAT THEY'D BEEN

163
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
TRAINED TO DO IN THE SENSE OF

164
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
EMERGENCY AND REMEMBER THAT

165
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THIS PLACE IS JUST, AN IDYLLIC

166
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
KIND OF PLACE.

167
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
>> TOWN, YEAH, I MEAN, MY

168
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
BROTHER IS A TEACHER AND I

169
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT FOR

170
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
TEACHER AND THEY LOVE TEAR

171
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
KIDS SO MUCH AND I DON'T

172
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
THINK, YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE

173
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
ULTIMATE SACRIFICE THAT WE SAW

174
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
WHAT THE TEACHERS ARE DOING.

175
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T

176
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
ALWAYS APPRECIATE JUST HOW

177
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
MUCH THEY REALLY DO LOVE THESE

178
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
KIDS AND REALLY GIVE THEIR

179
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
LIVES TO THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY

180
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
AND THEN IN THIS WAY, IN THE

181
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
ULTIMATE WAY.

182
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
AND BY THROWING THEMSELVES IN

183
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
FRONT OF THIS GUNMAN, THEY

184
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
DELAYED, YOU KNOW, ENOUGH FOR

185
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS TO GET

186
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
THERE BECAUSE THE FIRST

187
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
RESPONDERS SAID THERE WAS SO

188
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
MUCH AMMO LEFT OVER, THAT HE

189
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
BASICALLY, THE SHOOTER KILLED

190
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
HIMSELF BECAUSE THE FIRST

191
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
RESPONDERS SHOWED UP AND I

192
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
GUESS HE DIDN'T WANT THEM TO

193
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
BE ABLE TO KILL HIM OR CAPTURE

194
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
HIM.

195
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
SO, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW

196
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
MUCH WORSE THE CARNAGE WOULD

197
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
HAVE BEEN, HAD THE PRINCIPAL,

198
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
HAD THE TEACHER NOT, YOU KNOW,

199
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
DELAYED HIM.

200
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
>> LIKE WE'VE SAID, STEVE, WE

201
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
DON'T KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THIS

202
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
COMPLETE STORY AND SO MUCH

203
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
MORE COULD POTENTIALLY COME

204
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
OUT ABOUT THIS.
>> YEAH, I SUSPECT WE'LL LEARN

205
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
A LOT MORE ABOUT WHAT THE

206
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
TEACHERS DID AND WHAT THE

207
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
ADMINISTRATORS DID AND IT'S

208
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
THE CASE THAT TEACHERS TAKE

209
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
THIS PERSONALLY, FOR THE VAST

210
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
MAJORITY OF TEACHERS, GOING TO

211
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
SCHOOL EVERY DAY IS NOT JUST

212
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
SHOWING UP AT A JOB.

213
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
THEY TAKE THIS PERSONALLY.

214
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
THEY'RE PERSONALLY INVESTED IN

215
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THE LIVES OF THEIR STUDENTS

216
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
AND WHEN THEIR STUDENTS DON'T

217
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
DO WELL, THE TEACHERS GO HOME

218
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
AND THEY WORRY ABOUT IT AT

219
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
NIGHT AND I THINK WHAT YOU'VE

220
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000

OF THAT LEVEL OF CARING AND IN

223
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
THIS KIND OF AN EVENT, THAT

224
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
THE TEACHERS DO, YOU KNOW,

225
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
THESE KIND OF -- THEY TAKE

226
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
THIS KIND OF CARE ON A DAILY

227
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
BA
SIS AND YOU JUST DON'T SEE IT

228
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
IN THIS WAY.

229
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000

OFFICE.

267
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I WILL NOTE THOUGH THAT PEOPLE

CORNERS OF THE GLOBE.

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I SPOKE TO A RED CROSS

SMILE TO THEIR FACES AND

288
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
DIFFICULT EVENING TO CONTINUE

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
THERE'S NO PARKING AND CARS

304
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
LINED UP ON EITHER SIDE OF ME

305
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
AND A HIGHWAY TO MY RIGHT JUST

306
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
PAST THE HIGH SCHOOL AND ONE

307
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
WOMAN WHO JUST WALKED BY AND I

308
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
ASKED A WOMAN WHERE SHE'D

309
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
PARKED HER CAR AND SHE SAID

310
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
EXIT 10 OFF THE HIGHWAY ON THE

311
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
OTHER SIDE OF THE HIGH SCHOOL

312
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
AND I SAID HOW FAR IS THAT?

313
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
TWO MILES, SHE WAS WALKING

314
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
WITH OTHER PEOPLE, SHE WAS

315
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
WALKING TWO MILES IN THE RAIN

316
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
JUST TO BE AT THIS PRAYER

317
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
VIGIL.

318
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE

319
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
DEPTH OF THE PAIN PEOPLE ARE

320
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
FEELING, BUT THE SUPPORT

321
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
THEY'RE WILLING TO GIVE ONE

322
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
ANOTHER TONIGHT, BRET.

323
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
>> YEAH, PRETTY AMAZING.

324
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
AND DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

325
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
THE SPEECH AS OF YET, THE

326
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH?

327
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
>> ALL WE -- ALL WE KNOW ABOUT

328
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH IS THAT

329
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
SOME OF HIS ADVERTISERS HAVE

330
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
SAID HE DOES NOT WANT TO TALK

331
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL AND SOME OF

332
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
THE ISSUES THAT HAVE COME OUT

333
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
IN TERMS OF PUBLIC POLICIES

334
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT GIVEN

335
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
EVERYTHING LAID OUT ABOUT THE

336
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
COMMUNITY IT'S NOT THE TIME OR
PLACE TO DO IT, BUT AS YOU

337
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
KNOW, THERE ARE SOME, LIKE NEW

338
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
YORK CITY MAYOR MICHAEL

339
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
BLOOMBERG, SAYING EVERY TIME

340
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
THERE'S A TRAGEDY LIKE THIS,

341
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
TUCSON, AURORA AND NOW IS NOT

342
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT.

343
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
HE BELIEVES IT'S THE TIME TO

344
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
TALK ABOUT IT.

345
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
AND YOU MENTIONED SENATOR JOE

346
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
LIEBERMAN HE TALKED TO

347
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
REPORTERS AND TALKED ABOUT THE

348
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
COMMISSION YOU MENTIONED HE'S

349
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
NOW PUSHING, NOT JUST WITH GUN

350
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
CONTROL, BUT TAKE A LOOK AT

351
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES AND

352
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
VIOLENCE FROM HOLLYWOOD, WHAT

353
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
KIND OF ROLE THAT MAY PLAY, IN

354
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
TERMS OF AFFECTING CHILDREN

355
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
AND WHAT NOT.

356
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
SO, SENATOR LIEBERMAN WHO IS

357
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
RETIRING MAY OBVIOUSLY BE

358
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
SOMEBODY WHO COULD LEAD A

359
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
COMMISSION LIKE THAT, WE'LL
SEE IF THE PRESIDENT REACHES

360
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
OUT TO HIM ON THAT.

361
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
WE'RE TOLD THAT THE PRESIDENT

362
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
WILL NOT TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC

363
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
POLICY ISSUES, HE WANTS THIS

364
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
TO BE ABOUT PRAYER AND

365
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
REMEMBRANCE, BRET.

366
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
>> AS WE'RE LOOKING LIVE

367
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
THERE, WE SEE THE TABLE IN

368
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
FRONT OF THE PODIUM THERE AND

369
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I THINK THAT THAT IS--

370
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
THOSE ARE CANDLES, PROBABLY 26

371
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
CANDLES THERE ON THE STAGE TO

372
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
REPRESENT THE 26 PEOPLE KILLED

373
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
INSIDE THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

374
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

375
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
SHOOTINGS.
THERE WAS A SHOOTER ON THE

928
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
LOOSE HERE IN D.C. THAT

929
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
DOMINATED EVERYTHING.

930
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
WE WERE CONSUMED IN WASHINGTON

931
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
D.C. WITH GOING TO A GAS

932
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
STATION, TAKING YOUR KIDS OUT

933
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
TO THE HOME DEPOT.

934
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
>> YES.

935
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
>> Bret: AND YOU THINK ABOUT

936
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE GRIPPED

937
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
WITH FEAR AFTER ONE OF THESE

938
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
EVENTS.
>> WELL, I THINK AS YOU'RE

939
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
SAYING, HE'S NOT JUST SPEAKING

940
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
TO THIS CROWD HERE, HE'S

941
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
SPEAKING TO THE NATION, A

942
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
NATION WHO IS MOURNING AND A

943
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
NATION WHO IS FRIGHTENED AND

944
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN

945
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000

946
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
THEY SEE THIS AND THEY THINK

THIS COULD HAPPEN TO MY

948
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
CHILDREN.

949
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I MEAN, WHAT'S TO SAY THERE'S

950
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
NOT A COPY CAT OR SOMETHING

951
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
LIKE THAT, AND I THINK THAT

952
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS TO -- IS

953
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000

AND STEVEN, WE TALKED ABOUT

1015
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
WHAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO DO

1016
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
TONIGHT.

1017
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
>> I THINK HIS MAIN MESSAGE IS

1018
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PEOPLE

1019
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT WE'RE

1020
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
ALTOGETHER IN THIS.

1021
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
THAT WE'RE WITH THE PEOPLE IN

1022
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
NEWTOWN, THAT WE'RE THINKING

1023
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
ABOUT YOU, WE'RE PRAYING

1024
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
ALONGSIDE YOU.

1025
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
HE REALLY DOES HAVE TO BE THE

1026
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
CONSOLER IN CHIEF.

1027
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
WHILE IT DOES SEEM ODD TO SAY

1028
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
IT THIS EARLY BECAUSE THE PAIN

1029
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
IS SO RAW AND SO FRESH, IT'S

1030
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
INEVITABLE THAT THIS SERVICE

1031
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
WILL PROBABLY BE THE FIRST

1032
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
STEP IN WHAT WILL BE A LONG

1033
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
AND INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT

1034
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
RECOVERY PROCESS AND THE

1035
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
PRESIDENT'S JOB IN SOME WAYS

1036
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
IS TO BEGIN THAT PROCESS WITH

1037
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
WORDS OF HEALING ALONG WITH

1038
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
LEADING CLERGYMEN, CLERGY

1039
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
FOLKS WITH HIM TONIGHT.

1040
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
>> Bret: CHARLES, WE'VE HEARD

1041
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
FROM ED HENRY THAT THIS WILL

1042
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
NOT BE A POLICY SPEECH, THAT

1043
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
THIS WILL BE A CONSOLING

1044
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
SPEECH, THIS WILL BE A UNITING

1045
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
SPEECH.

1046
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
WE HEARD A LOT ON THE SUNDAY

1047
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
SHOWS, ABOUT POLICY

1048
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
PROJECTIONS GOING FORWARD, BUT

1049
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
NOT TONIGHT.

1050
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
>> NOT TONIGHT, BUT I DO THINK

1051
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
THAT THIS EVENT IS LIKELY TO

1052
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
BE A WATERSHED, I MEAN, IT'S

1053
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
HARD TO PREDICT THESE THINGS

1054
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
BECAUSE WE'RE ALL CAUGHT UP IN

1055
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
THE EMOTION, BUT THE FREQUENCY

1056
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
OF THESE ATTACKS AND FINALLY,

1057
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
THE NATURE OF THIS ONE, IN THE

1058
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
SAME WAY THAT 9/11 WOKE US UP

1059
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
TO TERRORISM AFTER YEARS,

1060
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
DECADES OF BEING ATTACKED

1061
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
BECAUSE OF THE SHEER

1062
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
MAGNITUDE, THIS ONE, I THINK,

1063
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
WILL MAKE A MAGNITUDE BECAUSE

1064
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
OF THE SHEER INNOCENCE OF THE

1065
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
VICTIMS.

1066
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
IN ARIZONA THE PRESIDENT IN

1067
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
THE SPEECH TALKED ABOUT RISING

1068
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF CIVIL

1069
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
DISCOURSE AND THE VEHICLE HE

1070
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
USED TO MAKE THAT POINT WAS

1071
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
THE NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO

1072
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
DIED IN THAT ATTACK.

1073
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
SHE WOULD HAVE WANTED US TO

1074
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
CONDUCT OURSELVES IN A BETTER

1075
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
WAY.

1076
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
AND IT WAS IN THAT CASE WAS

1077
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
ONLY A SINGLE CHILD.

1078
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
HERE IT IS ESSENTIALLY, YOU

1079
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
KNOW, A WHOLE CLASSROOM FULL

1080
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
OF UTTERLY INNOCENT CHANGE AND

1081
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
IN THE LANGUAGE, MEN, WOMEN

1082
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
AND CHILDREN, NOTHING SPECIAL

1083
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
ABOUT THE INNOCENCE--

1084
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
IN SOME WAY ALL THE VICTIMS

1085
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
ARE INNOCENT, BUT SUDDENLY

1086
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
TRANSCENDENTLY, IT'S ABOUT

1087
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
CHILDREN.
I THINK THAT MAY MAKE THE

1088
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
DIFFERENCE AND I THINK THE

1089
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
BEST COURSE IS THE ONE THAT

1090
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
LIEBERMAN SUGGESTED NOT RASH

1091
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
ACTION AND NOT BUSINESS AS

1092
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
USUAL, BUT A COMMISSION THAT

1093
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
WILL LOOK AT THIS, BRING IN

1094
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
STUDIES AND BRING IN SOCIAL

1095
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
SCIENTISTS AND HAVE

1096
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
CONCLUSIONS THE WAY AS 9/11.

1097
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
>> Bret: WE'LL CONTINUE WITH

1098
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000

SLIGHT DELAY TO THE START OF

WAS GOING THROUGH THE GRIM

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
TASK OF GREETING EACH FAMILY

1108
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000

1109
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
CLASSROOMS SET OUT ON THE HIGH

00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
EACH OF THEM, AN AS THE PANEL

1113
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
HAS BEEN SAYING, TO START THE

1114
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
GRIEVING PROCESS, START THE

1115
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
HEALING PROCESS AS THEY MOVE

1116
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
FORWARD HERE.

1117
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I WILL NOTE IT IS VERY CHILLY

1118
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
OUT HERE, IT'S BEEN GETTING

1119
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
CHILLIER AS THE NIGHT WEARS ON

1120
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
AND YET, THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT

1121
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
OF PEOPLE LINED UP OUTSIDE AND

1122
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I NOW SEE SOME PEOPLE LEAVING

1123
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
BEHIND ME WE BELIEVE COULD NOT

1124
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
GET IN BECAUSE YOU SAID, IT'S

1125
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
ALREADY AT CAPACITY IN THAT

1126
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
AUDITORIUM.

1127
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
ONE WOMAN JUST IN THE LAST

1128
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
FIVE OR TEN MINUTES WALKED BY

1129
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
AND SHE WAS STILL HEADED IN,

1130
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
SHE DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS

1131
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
ALREADY FULL AND SHE WAS WITH

1132
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
A FRIEND AND I ASKED THEM HOW

1133
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
LONG IT TOOK THEM TO GET HERE

1134
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
BECAUSE THE CARS ARE LINED UP.

1135
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
THERE'S NO MORE PARKING SPACES

1136
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
NEAR THIS HIGH SCHOOL AND THE

1137
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
TWO WOMEN SAID THEY WALKED ONE

1138
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
HOUR IN THE RAIN, IN THE COLD,

1139
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
JUST TO BE HERE, JUST TO REACH

1140
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
OUT TO THE FELLOW MEMBERS OF

1141
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
THIS COMMUNITY.

1142
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
SO, IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF

1143
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
THE DEPTH OF THE PAIN THAT

1144
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
PEOPLE ARE FEELING, BUT ALSO,

1145
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
THE DEPTH WITH WHICH THEY'RE

1146
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
REACHING OUT TO TRY TO HELP

1147
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
ONE ANOTHER THROUGH THIS

1148
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
CRISIS, BRET.

1149
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
>> Bret: THANK YOU, ON THE

1150
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
STAGE 26 CANDLES IN GLASSES IN

1151
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
FRONT OF THE PODIUM THERE.

1152
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
26 CANDLES REPRESENTING THE 26

1153
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
PEOPLE KILLED INSIDE SANDY

1154
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1155
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
20 OF THEM CHILDREN, AGES SIX

1156
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
AND SEVEN YEARS OLD.

1157
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
NINA EASTEN, FORTUNE MAGAZINE.

1158
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
>> I THINK TO REMEMBER IT'S

1159
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
NOT EVEN THE LARGEST MASS

1160
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
MURDER AT A SCHOOL, VIRGINIA

1161
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
TECH WAS, BUT THIS IS THE --

1162
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
WE HOPE, AS CHARLES SAID, A

1163
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
TIPPING POINT BECAUSE WHEN IT

1164
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
INVOLVES SMALL CHILDREN, SIX

1165
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS, WHOSE

1166
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
BODIES WERE RIDDLED WITH

1167
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
BULLETS, RANGING FROM THREE TO

1168
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
EIGHT--

1169
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
THREE TO 11 WOUNDS PER CHILD,

1170
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
IT'S SO HORRIFIC THAT IT

1171
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
SHOULD BE TREATED AS A MOMENT

1172
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
JUST LIKE 9/11 WAS, WE SHOULD

1173
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
HAVE A CRISIS COMMISSION TO

1174
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
LOOK AT THIS.

1175
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE PAST

1176
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
KILLINGS, THESE MASS KILLINGS,

1177
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
BOTH FROM SCHOOLS AND OUTSIDE,

1178
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS

1179
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
THAT STAND OUT FOR BEING IN

1180
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
COMMON.

1181
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
ONE IS THAT THERE WERE WARNING

1182
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
SIGNS AND IT OFTEN INVOLVED

1183
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
SOMEBODY WHO WAS EMOTIONALLY

1184
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
UNSTABLE AND PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT

1185
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
IT AND SECONDLY, IT INVOLVED

1186
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND

1187
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
RAISES THE DEATH TOLL AND

1188
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
MAKES IT A MASS MURDER AS

1189
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
OPPOSED TO A MURDER.

1190
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
>> KIRSTEN.
>> WE HOPE IT'S A WATERSHED

1191
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
MOMENTS, WE FOCUS ON THE

1192
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
MOMENTS AND MOVE ON AND THE

1193
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST ENTRENCHED

1194
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARGUE NO,

1195
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
WE MUST HAVE SEMI AUTOMATIC

1196
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
WEAPONS OR YOU CAN'T DO

1197
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
ANYTHING TO LIMIT VIDEO GAMES.

1198
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
YOU HAVE THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

1199
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
SELF-INTEREST IN IT AND THEY

1200
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
TEND TO DOMINATE.

1201
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
WHAT MAKES THIS ONE, AS

1202
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
CHARLES WAS SAYING, THEY WERE

1203
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
INNOCENT, BUT THEY WERE

1204
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
HELPLESS.
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

1205
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
MAJOR THINGS YOU OFTEN HEAR

1206
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
PEOPLE SAYING, WELL, IF THE

1207
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
PERSON HAD BEEN ARMED THEY

1208
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
COULD HAVE DEFENDED

1209
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
THEMSELVES.

1210
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
WELL, THESE WERE THE MOST

1211
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
HELPLESS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD

1212
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
THESE LITTLE CHILDREN WHO

1213
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
WOULDN'T KNOW, MAYBE THEY KNEW

1214
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
TO RUN AWAY AT BEST, BUT YOU

1215
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
KNOW, WHO REALLY LOOKED TO

1216
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
ADULTS TO HELP THEM.

1217
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
IF THIS ISN'T A WATERSHED

1218
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
MOMENT THEN WE PROBABLY NEVER

1219
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
WILL HAVE ONE SO I REALLY HOPE

1220
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
THAT WE'LL SEE SOMETHING COME

1221
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
OF THIS.

1222
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
>> Bret: IT MAY ALSO BE A

1223
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
WATERSHED MOMENT, STEVE, ON

1224
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
THE MENTAL ILLNESS SIDE OF THE

1225
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
COIN.

1226
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
WE HAVEN'T TALKED A LOT ABOUT

1227
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
THAT AS A NATION.

1228
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
BUT SOME PEOPLE TODAY ARE

1229
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
TALKING ABOUT THAT A LOT MORE

1230
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
THAN THEY EVER HAVE.
>> WELL, IF WE DO HAVE THAT

1231
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
KIND OF BROAD COMMISSION TAKE

1232
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
A LOOK AT THIS AND SAY, LOOK,

1233
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
NORMALLY I'M SKEPTICAL OF

1234
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
THESE KINDS OF COMMISSIONS

1235
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON,

1236
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
THEY'RE AN EXCUSE NOT TO GET

1237
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
SOMETHING DONE RATHER THAN TO

1238
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION

1239
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
ABOUT IMPORTANT ISSUES, BUT I

1240
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
THINK IN THIS CASE WE COULD

1241
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
HAVE THAT KIND OF CONVERSATION

1242
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
POTENTIALLY, THROUGH A

1243
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
COMMISSION, BUT IT WOULD HAVE

1244
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
TO INCLUDE THOSE KINDS OF

1245
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
ISSUES, I MEAN, WE'VE SEEN AS

1246
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
WE'VE DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT

1247
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
EARLIER, AGAIN AND AGAIN AND

1248
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
AGAIN, SIGNS AND WARNINGS

1249
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
REPEATEDLY AGAIN AND AGAIN,

1250
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
PEOPLE, PARENTS WHO HAVE CRIED

1251
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
OUT AND SAID THAT THEY WANT

1252
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
ASSISTANCE, THAT THEY WANT

1253
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
HELP AND UNABLE TO GET IT.

1254
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
THAT HAS TO BE PART OF THIS

1255
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
DISCUSSION, PARTICULARLY IF WE

1256
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
LEARN MORE ABOUT ADAM LANZA

1257
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
AND THE PROBLEMS THAT HE MAY

1258
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
HAVE HAD.
>> CHARLES?

1259
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
>> I THINK IF YOU PUT

1260
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
LIEBERMAN AND RUDY GUILIANI IN

1261
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
CHARGE, YOU MIGHT GET A

1262
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
COMMISSION THAT ACTUALLY DOES

1263
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
SOMETHING AND EVERYTHING HAS

1264
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
TO BE ON THE TABLE, ALL THE
THREE ELEMENTS.

1265
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I MEAN, FOR 30 YEARS EVER

1266
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
MENTALLY ILL, NOT OVER THERE,

1267
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
BUT BECAUSE OF THE HOMELESS

1268
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE MENTALLY

1269
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
ILL, THEY'RE NOT DESTITUTE AND

1270
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
WE LEAVE THEM TO DIE IN THE

1271
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
COLD WITH THEIR RIGHTS ON.

1272
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
AND OF COURSE I'VE BEEN

1273
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
TALKING IN THE THE WIND ALL OF

1274
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
THESE YEARS, BUT THERE'S A

1275
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
CHANGE IN OUR ATTITUDE WITH

1276
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
COMMITMENT AND ABUSE OF THAT

1277
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
IN THE 50'S, BUT THERE'S GOT

1278
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
TO BE LOOKING AT THAT AS WELL

1279
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
AS THE OTHER ELEMENTS.

1280
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
AS I SAID IT'S GOING TO

1281
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
IMPINGE ON THE FIRST

1282
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
AMENDMENT, GOING TO IMPINGE ON

1283
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
THE SECOND, GOING TO IMPINGE
ON THE FIFTH.

1284
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
THAT'S A LOT OF IMPINGING, BUT

1285
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
OUR COUNTRY MIGHT BE READY FOR

1286
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
THAT HOW TO DEAL WITH A MASS

1287
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
KILLINGS IN AN OPEN SOCIETY.

1288
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
>> Bret: WE'VE BEEN JUST GIVEN

1289
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
UNDER TWO MINUTE WARNING AND

1290
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE

1291
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
OFFICIAL START OF THIS PRAYER

1292
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000

SCREAMING OUT IN PAIN.

00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
THINGS LIKE I KNEW A TEACHER

1352
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000

KNEW THE PRINCIPAL WHO WE'VE

1355
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
