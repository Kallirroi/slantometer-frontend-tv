BY THE ONE WEAPON.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I ONLY DID SEVEN OF THE

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
AUTOPSIES, THE VICTIMS I HAD

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
AND I ONLY SAW TWO OF THEM WITH

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
POST RANGE SHOOTING.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
>> EMILIE ALICE PARKER WAS THE

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
SWEETEST LITTLE GIRL I'VE EVER

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
KNOWN.
MY CHILDREN ARE GRIEVING, MY

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
SIBLINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
GRIEVING, AND WE'RE JUST

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
DEVASTATED THAT SOMEONE SO

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT IS NO

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
LONGER GOING TO BE IN OUR LIVES.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
AND FOR NO REASON.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
AND WE CAN ONLY PRAY THAT WE

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
FIND UNDERSTANDING IN THE DAYS

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
AND WEEKS TO COME.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
>> WOW.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SEARCHING

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
FOR UNDERSTANDING TONIGHT.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
YOU ALL KNOW THE NAME OF THE

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
SHOOTER BY NOW, AND WE WANT YOU

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
TO KNOW THE NAMES OF THE

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
VICTIMS.
SO WE'RE REALLY GOING TO BE

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
CAN TONIGHT, AND, OF COURSE, IN

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THE DAYS AHEAD ON THIS PROGRAM.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'M NOT GOING TO KEEP REPEATING

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
THE NAME OF THE SHOOTER BECAUSE

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
YOU ALREADY KNOW IT I DON'T WANT

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
THAT NAME TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
IN THIS TOWN DO NOT WANT THE
NAME OF THE PERSON, THE KILLER,

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
TO BE KNOWN IN HOUSEHOLDS AND TO

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
GO DOWN IN HISTORY.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THEY WANT THE NAMES OF THE

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
VICTIMS TO BE REMEMBERED.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
AND WE WILL REMEMBER THEM

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
TONIGHT.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI IS JOINING ME

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
NOW WITH THE LATEST ON THE

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
INVESTIGATION.
YOU WERE IN NEWTOWN JUST HOURS

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
AFTER THE SHOOTING HAPPENED,

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
SUSAN.
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM PEOPLE

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
TODAY?

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
>> WELL, WE'RE HEARING THAT

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
EVERYONE WANTS TO FIND OUT WHY,

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
WHY THIS HAPPENED.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
WHAT LED THIS YOUNG MAN TO DO

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
THIS.
AND WE KNOW THAT AUTHORITIES ARE

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
TRACING HIM WAY BACK, AS FAR AS

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
THEY CAN GO, BUT PRIMARILY

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
CONCENTRATE ON THE TIME HE WAS A

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
TEENAGER UP UNTIL NOW WHEN HE'S

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
20 YEARS OLD.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
AND, IN FACT, CNN OBTAINED A

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
PHOTOGRAPH, ONE TAKEN IN 2005

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
WHEN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT 13

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
YEARS OLD.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
WE ALSO KNOW THAT AUTHORITIES

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
HAVE BEEN SPENDING THE ENTIRE

116
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
DAY CHASING DOWN LEADS, ALSO

117
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
LOOKING AT ANYTHING HE WOULD

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
HAVE WRITTEN DOWN, LETTERS,

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
CORRESPONDENT.

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
AND THEY EVEN WENT TO VARIOUS

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
GUN RANGES AS WELL AS A SPORTING

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
GOODS STORE BECAUSE THEY GOT A

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
TIP, A TIP THAT THE SHOOTER HAD

124
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
GONE THERE TO PURCHASE A GUN ON

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
TUESDAY.

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
WELL, THEY TALKED TO THE

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
EMPLOYEES, THEY LOOKED HARD AT

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
ALL THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEOS FROM

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THAT DAY AND THEY SAY THEY HAVE

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
NOT BEEN ABLE TO PULL ANYTHING

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
OUT OF THAT.

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
THAT LEAD JUST DID NOT PAN OUT.

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
BUT WE ALSO LEARNED FROM THE

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
ATF, AND EERSON THAT THEY FOUND

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
THREE MORE WEAPONS AT THE HOUSE

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
THAT THE YOUNG MAN SHARED WITH

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
HIS MOTHER.

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
NOW, THEY DIDN'T SAY WHAT THOSE

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
WEAPONS WERE, BUT MY SOURCES

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
TELL ME THEY ARE THREE OLDER

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
MODEL RIFLES.

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
AND SO THEY'VE BEEN TRACING, SO

143
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
FAR HAVE TRACED ONLY ONE OF THEM

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
TO HIS MOTHER.
ANDERSON?

145
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
>> AND WHAT DO WE KNOW NOW ABOUT

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
THE THREE WEAPONS THAT WERE

147
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
TAKEN INTO THE SCHOOL?

148
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
>> WELL, THOSE THREE WE NOW KNOW

149
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES THAT
ALL THREE OF THEM WERE FOUND

150
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
RIGHT THERE WITH THE SHOOTER.

151
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
THOSE WERE TWO HANDGUNS AND A

152
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
LONG GUN THAT WE NOW KNOW CALLED

153
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
A BUSHMASTER.

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
AND YOU HEARD THE MEDICAL

155
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
EXAMINER REFER TO THE LONG GUN

156
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
SPECIFICALLY TODAY.
HE SAID THAT THE SHOOTER USED

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
THAT LONG GUN TO KILL SEVERAL OF

158
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
HIS VICTIMS.

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
SOME WITH ANYWHERE FROM 3 TO 11

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
WOUNDS EACH, ANDERSON.

161
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
JUST A VICIOUS, COLD BLOODED
KILLING.

162
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
ANDERSON?

163
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
>> SUSAN CANDIOTTI, APPRECIATE

164
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
YOUR REPORTING TONIGHT.

165
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
WE'RE OBVIOUSLY BEING VERY

166
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
RESPECTFUL AND NOT APPROACHING

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
ANYBODY WHO IS IN MOURNING OR IN

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
LOSS.
AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
INTRUDE ON ANYBODY'S GRIEF, BUT

170
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
SOME FAMILIES ARE SPEAKING.

171
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
AND THEY DO WANT YOU TO KNOW

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
ABOUT THEIR CHILD, THEIR CHILD
WHO IS LOST.

173
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
WE JUST HEARD FROM THE FATHER OF
ONE LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS KILLED

174
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
YESTERDAY.
AND HE SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW TO

175
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
GET THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
BUT THE MAN WHO SAID THOSE WORDS

177
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
WILL HAVE TO FIND A WAY, OF

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
COURSE.
AND SO WILL SO MANY OTHER

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
FAMILIES HERE.
HIS DAUGHTER, 6-YEAR-OLD EMILIE

180
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
PARKER WAS ONE OF THE CHILDREN

181
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
KILLED AND CARRYING THE

182
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
UNBEARABLE PAIN.

183
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
ROBBIE PARKER WENT BEFORE

184
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
CAMERAS TONIGHT TO TELL THE

185
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
WORLD ABOUT THAT PAIN AND ABOUT

186
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
HIS DAUGHTER.

187
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
AND SHOW HIS LOVE AND ADMIRATION

188
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
FOR THE LITTLE GIRL HE DESCRIBED

189
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
AS EXTRAORDINARY.

190
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
LISTEN.

191
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
>> MY NAME IS ROBBIE PARKER.

192
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
MY FAMILY IS ONE OF THE FAMILIES

193
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
THAT LOST A CHILD YESTERDAY IN

194
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

195
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
SCHOOLS HERE IN CONNECTICUT.

196
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY SO MANY

197
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
PEOPLE AND AGENCIES WANTING TO

198
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
KNOW HOW WE'RE DOING, AND I JUST

199
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THIS MIGHT BE

200
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
THE BEST WAY TO SHARE THOSE
FEELINGS WITH EVERYBODY.

201
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD REALLY

202
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
LIKE TO OFFER OUR DEEPEST

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILIES

204
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
AFFECTED BY THIS SHOOTING.

205
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
IT'S A HORRIFIC TRAGEDY AND WE

206
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT OUR

207
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
HEARTS AND PRAYERS GO OUT TO

208
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
THEM.

209
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD THIS

210
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
EXPERIENCE MUST BE FOR YOU AND I

211
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR FAMILY

212
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
AND OUR LOVE AND SUPPORT GO OUT

213
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
TO YOU AS WELL.

214
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
AT THIS TIME, OUR THANKS GO OUT

215
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
TO SO MANY PEOPLE, SO MANY

216
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND COMPLETE

217
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
STRANGERS WHO WE DON'T KNOW, FOR

218
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
ALL THE LOVE, CONDOLENCES AND

219
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
SUPPORT YOU'VE GIVEN US.

220
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
MY DAUGHTER EMILIE WOULD BE ONE

221
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE STANDING

222
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
AND GIVING HER LOVE AND SUPPORT

223
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS, BECAUSE

224
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
THAT'S THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT

225
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
SHE IS.

226
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
NOT BECAUSE OF ANY PARENTING

227
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
THAT MY WIFE AND I COULD HAVE

228
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
DONE, BUT BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE

229
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
GIFTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY

230
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
HER HEAVENLY FATHER.

231
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

232
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

233
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
COMFORT, REFLECTING ON THE

234
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILY WAS

235
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
AND HOW MANY LIVES THAT SHE WAS

236
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT TIME

237
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
HERE ON EARTH.

238
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
EMI

239
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

240
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
VERY LOVING.

241
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
EMILIE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO TRY

242
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
NEW THINGS, OTHER THAN FOOD.

243
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
SHE TOUCHED THE LIVES OF

244
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
EVERYONE SHE CAME IN CONTACT
WITH.

245
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
SHECHS AN EXCEPTIONAL ARTIST AND

246
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
SHE ALWAYS CARRIED AROUND HER

247
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
MARKERS AND PENCILS SO SHE NEVER

248
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
MISSED AN TUPTD TO DRAW A

249
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
PICTURE OR MAKE A CARD FOR THOSE

250
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
AROUND HER.

251
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF

252
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
TIMES EMILIE NOTICED SOMEONE

253
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
FEELING SAD OR FRUSTRATED AND

254
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
WOULD RUSH TO FIND A PIECE OF

255
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
PAPER TO DRAW THEM A PICTURE OR

256
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
TO WRITE THEM AN ENCOURAGING

257
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
NOTE.

258
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
EMILIE'S CARD MAKING WAS

259
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
EXPREZZED BEAUTIFULLY THIS LAST

260
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
OCTOBER WHEN SHE PLACED A VERY

261
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
SPECIAL CARD THAT SHE HAD MADE

262
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
INTO THE CASKET WITH HER GRANDPA

263
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
WHO ALSO JUST RECENT LLY DIED OA

264
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
TRAGIC ACCIDENT.

265
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER TWO

266
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
LITTLE SISTERS, DELIGHTING IN

267
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ, DANCE

268
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS IN
LIFE.

269
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
EMILIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS

270
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE

271
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
PLEASURE TO MEET HER WOULD AGREE

272
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
THAT THIS WORLD IS A BETTER

273
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
PLACE BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN IN

274
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
IT.

275
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT HAPPENED

276
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO SO MANY

277
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN INTO

278
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US.

279
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US TO BE

280
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
BETTER, TO BE MORE COMPASSIONATE

281
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
AND MORE HUMBLE PEOPLE.

282
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
LET'S PLEASE KEEP THE SENTIMENTS

283
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
OF LOVE THAT WE FEEL FOR OUR

284
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
FAMILIES AND THE COMPASSION THAT

285
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
WE FEEL FOR OTHERS, EVEN

286
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
COMPLETE STRANGERS, AND KEEP

287
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
THEM WITH US AT ALL TIMES.

288
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
NOT JUST IN THE TIMES OF SORROW

289
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
AND TRAGEDY.

290
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
AND LET'S DO THIS SO WE CAN MAKE

291
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY FEEL

292
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
SAFE.
THANK YOU.

293
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
>> ROBBIE PARKER SPEAKING ABOUT

294
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
HIS DAUGHTER, EMILIE.

295
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
THAT'S EMILIE IN THE BOTTOM

296
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
RIGHT CORNER.

297
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
YOU TALKED ABOUT EMILIE BEING A

298
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
MENTOR TO HER SISTERS, EVEN AT

299
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
THE SENDER AGE OF 6 YEARS OLD.

300
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
IN THE COMING DAYS WE'RE GOING

301
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
TO BE HEARING MORE FROM PARENTS

302
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
WHO WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT THEIR

303
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
CHILDREN.
WE'RE GOING TO BE LEARNING MORE

304
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
ABOUT THE CHILDREN, AND IT JUST

305
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
ADDS TO THE HORROR OF THIS

306
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
EVENT.
THE THIS ENTIRE COMMUNITY FEELS.

307
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
WE WERE THERE WHEN ROBBIE PARKER

308
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
FACED THE CAMERAS.

309
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I CAN'T -- THE STRENGTH FWR HIM

310
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
TO COME OUT AND SPEAK AT A TIME

311
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
WITH SUCH GRIEF AS WE TALK ABOUT

312
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
COMPASSION FOR OTHERS IS
EXTRAORDINARY.

313
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
>> IT'S INCREDIBLE.

314
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
TO STAND IF OUR OR FIVE FEET

315
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
AWAY FROM THE FATHER WHO JUST

316
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
LOST HIS DAUGHTER TO GUN

317
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
VIOLENCE AND THEN TALK ABOUT

318
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
COMPASSION AND NOT LETTING THIS

319
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
DEFINE ALL OF US.

320
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
AND HIS ADVICE TO OTHER PEOPLE,

321
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
THE NEED TO HEAL, THIS HAS GOT

322
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
TO BE SOMETHING THAT IMPROVES

323
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
SOCIETY OVERALL AND NOT JUST

324
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
FOCUSING ON HIS OWN PERSONAL

325
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
GRIEF.

326
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT.

327
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
IN YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE

328
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
PEOPLE YOU KNOW IN YOUR LIFE,

329
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A PARENT

330
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
AND HAVE CHILDREN, TO IMAGINE

331
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
LOSING YOUR CHILD AND THEN BE

332
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
ABLE TO FACE REPORTERS TO SAY

333
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
THANK YOU FOR THE KINDNESS THAT

334
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
YOU RECEIVED IN THIS COUNTRY

335
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
JUST AS PEOPLE HAVE FOUND OUT

336
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
ABOUT IT.

337
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
FOR POSTING THINGS ON FACEBOOK.

338
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
IT'S REALLY QUITE EXTRAORDINARY.

339
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
AND WHEN I WAS SPEAKING FURTHER
FROM HIM, HE SAID LOOK, I'M NOT

340
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
ANGRY.

341
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
HE HAS TO FEEL THAT HE HAS TO BE

342
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
ABLE TO MOVE ON BY SHOWING

343
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
COMPASSION TO OTHERS SO OTHERS

344
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
CAN LEARN FROM WHAT HE IS GOING

345
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
THROUGH, NOT ONLY HIM, BUT HIS

346
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
SISTER-IN-LAW.
HERE'S WHAT SHE TOLD REPORTERS

347
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
JUST BEFORE HER FATHER SPOKE.

348
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
>> OUR FAMILY IS FROM UTAH.

349
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I GOT A CALL YESTERDAY MORNING

350
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
FROM MY SISTER SAYING THERE HAD

351
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
BEEN A SHOOTING AND THERE WAS A

352
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
LOCKDOWN AT THE SCHOOL.

353
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I WAS GIVING HER WORDS OF

354
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
COMFORT AS SHE WAS FRANTICALLY

355
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
ATTEMPTING TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS

356
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
GOING ON AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED.

357
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
AULD I COULD WAS ASSURE IN EVERY

358
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
OTHER INSTANCE WHEN A SHOOTING

359
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
HAPPENS, IT'S NOT THE 5, 6 AND 7

360
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
YEAR OLDS WHO ARE GOING TO BE

361
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
TARGETED.
THEY'RE TOO INNOCENT AND

362
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
PERFECT.
AS I TRIED TO REASSURE HER

363
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY, AS I HOPPED

364
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
INTO AN AIRPLANE, AS I LEFT, I

365
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
DIDN'T KNOW THE STATUS OF MY

366
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
NIECE UNTIL WE ARRIVED IN

367
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
ATLANTA.

368
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
>> AND THAT'S IN LARGE PART WHY

369
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
THE FAMILY WANTED TO COME OUT

370
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
AND SPEAK TO REPORTERS.

371
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
SOMETHING ELSE I WANTED TO

372
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
MENTION IS THE FATHER ROBBIE IS

373
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
A PHYSICIANS ASSISTANT TREATING

374
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
CHILDREN.
THEY MOVED HERE EIGHT MONTHS

375
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
AGO.

376
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
TO LOSE THEIR CHILD LIKE THIS IS

377
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
REALLY UNFAIR, IT'S HARD TO

378
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
IMAGINE.

379
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
>> APPRECIATE IT, KIM.

380
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
GLAD YOU WERE THERE AND WE WERE

381
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
ABLE TO HEAR FROM ROBBIE ABOUT

382
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
HIS DAUGHTER.

383
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
YESTERDAY, WE SAW SOME TRULY

384
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
HEROIC EFFORTS BY TEACHERS, BY

385
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS, BY FIRST

386
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
RESPONDERS.
WHEN THE BULLETS STARTED FLYING,

387
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
SO MANY TEACHERS DID WHAT THEY

388
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
HAD PRACTICED.

389
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
THEY USHER CANNED THE KIDS YOUU.

390
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
THE AMAZING PART IS HOW TEACHERS

391
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
WERE ABLE TO KEEP THE KIDS CALM.

392
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
LISTEN TO SOME OF WHAT THEY HAD

393
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
TO SAY.

394
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
>> THEY HAD A SPOT IN THE ROOM

395
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
WHERE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO GO

396
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
TO.

397
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
>> CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT SPOT?

398
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
>> IT'S BETWEEN SOME BOOKCASES

399
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
AGAINST THE CALL, WHERE YOU

400
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
CAN'T BE SEEN BY ANY WINDOWS.

401
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
ONE OF OUR DOORS WASN'T LOCKED

402
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
SO WE WENT INTO A BACK STORAGE

403
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
ROOM AND LOCKED THE KIDS

404
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
TOGETHER.

405
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
>> HOW DID YOU KEEP THE KIDS

406
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
QUIET?

407
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
>> THERE WAS CRAYONS AND ERP PA

408
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
AND WEER TO SOME UP AND HAD THEM

409
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
COLOR.
>> WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?

410
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
>> THERE WERE THREE OTHER ADULTS

411
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
WITH THEM.

412
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
THEY ASKED WHAT WAS GOING ON.

413
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
WE SAID WE DON'T KNOW.

414
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
WE ASKED THEM TO STAY QUIET.

415
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
IT MAY BE A DRILL, IT MAY NOT.

416
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
>> YOU DIDN'T KNOW AT THAT

417
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
POINT?
>> WE KNEW.

418
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I CALLED THE OFFICE AND SHE TOLD

419
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
ME THERE WAS A SHOOTER.

420
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
>> THERE WAS POUND ON THE DOOR.

421
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
THEY SAID IT WAS THE POLICE.

422
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
WE DIDN'T WANT TO OPEN THE DOOR,

423
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
SO HE FIRST SLID A BADGE UNDER

424
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
THE DOOR, BUT WE HAD FILE

425
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
CABINETS IN FRONT OF IT SO WE

426
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
HAD TO MOVE THOSE.

427
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
>> ABOUT 9:30, 9:40, WE HEARD

428
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
NOISES.

429
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM WAS

430
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
STILL ON.

431
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
IT DID GO OFF TO WHAT SOUNDED

432
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
LIKE POPS AND GUNSHOTS.

433
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL THAT TO

434
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
5-YEAR-OLDS.

435
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I SAID WE'RE GOING TO A SAFE

436
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
AREA.
AND WE'RE GOING TO, YOU KNOW, WE

437
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
READ A STORY AND WE KEPT THEM

438
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
CALM.

439
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
>> THE TEACHER MANAGED TO TAKE

440
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
TWO CHILDREN OUT OF THE HALLWAY,

441
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
PULL THEM INTO THE CLASSROOM.

442
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
LOCKED THE DOOR AND MOVED

443
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
EVERYBODY OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE ROOM.

444
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
>> WHEN I SAW THOSE TEACHERS AND

445
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
LOCKED EYES WITH EACH OF THOSE

446
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
SEPARATELY, WHEN I FOUND THE TWO

447
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
CHILDREN, IF I COULD GO BACK, I

448
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
WOULD EMBRACE THEM.

449
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY

450
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
HAD GONE THROUGH.

451
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
>> ONE OF THE FIRST VICTIMS TO

452
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
BE PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED WAS

453
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
VICTORIA SOTO, 27 YEARS OLD, A

454
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
FIRST GRADE FEETEACHER.

455
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
SHE WAS KILLED IN HER CLASSROOM.

456
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
SHE'S BEING MOURNED TONIGHT,

457
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
HAILED AS A HERO.

458
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
JASON, HOW IS STRAT FORD

459
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
REMEMBERING THIS YOUNG WOMAN

460
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
TONIGHT?
THERE WAS A VIGIL EARLIER.

461
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
>> ANDERSON, THAT VIGIL JUST

462
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
WRAPPING UP A FEW MOMENTS AGO,

463
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
EVERYONE COMING OUT HERE

464
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
TONIGHT, LEANING ON EACH OTHER

465
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
FOR SUPPORT.

466
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
A LOT OF THOSE WHO ARE COMING

467
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
OUT HERE TONIGHT WORE GREEN.

468
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
GREEN WAS ONE OF SOTO'S FAVORITE

469
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
COLORS.
IN TERMS OF HOW THEY'RE

470
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
REMEMBERING HER, THEY'RE

471
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
REMEMBERING HER AS A DEDICATED

472
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
TEACHER.
THIS IS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO

473
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
ACTUALLY WANTED TO BE A TEACHER

474
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
EVER SINCE SHE HERSELF WAS A

475
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
LITTLE GIRL.
AND WHEN THEY CAME OUT HERE

476
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
TONIGHT, THEY SANG "AMAZING

477
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
GRACE."
THEY LIT CANDLES.

478
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I ALSO EARLIER TODAY, ANDERSON,

479
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO

480
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SOTO

481
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
FAMILY.
THEY TALKED A LITTLE BIT MORE

482
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
ABOUT HOW THEY WANT VICKI SOTO

483
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
TO BE REMEMBERED.

484
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
AND THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE

485
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
HEROIC ACTIONS SHE TOOK IN HER

486
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
CLASSROOM TO SAVE HER STUDENTS.

487
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
>> THE FAMILY DIDN'T WANT VICKI

488
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
TO BE JUST ANOTHER VICTIM ON A

489
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
PIECE OF PAPER.

490
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
VICKI WAS AN OUTSTANDING

491
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
TEACHER, WELL LIKED, WELL

492
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
RESPECTED IN HER SCHOOL

493
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
COMMUNITY.

494
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
AND SHE WAS TAKEN TOO EARLY.

495
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
SHE INSTINCTIVELY WENT INTO

496
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
ACTION WHEN A MONSTER CAME INTO

497
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
HER CLASSROOM AND TRIED TO

498
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
PROTECT THE KIDS THAT SHE LOVED

499
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
SO MUCH.

500
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
>> CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT

501
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
MORE ABOUT HOW SHE TRIED TO DO

502
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
THAT?
>> WHAT WE WERE TOLD WAS SHE

503
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
GATHERED HER CHILDREN INTO A

504
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
CLOSET AND PUT HERSELF IN HARM'S

505
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
WAY IN BETWEEN THE GUNMAN AND

506
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
THE KIDS.

507
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
AND WE JUST WANT THE PUBLIC TO

508
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
KNOW THAT VICKI WAS A HERO.

509
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
REGARDLESS OF THE INTIMATE

510
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
DETAILS OF WHAT TOOK PLACE IN

511
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
THAT CLASSROOM, VICKI WAS DOING

512
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
WHAT SHE KNEW WAS RIGHT IN HER

513
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
HEART AND WHAT SHE WAS TRAINED

514
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
TO DO TO PROTECT HER KIDS.

515
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
>> SO MANY TEARS HERE TONIGHT,

516
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
ANDERSON.
ALSO HERE TONIGHT WAS VICKI'S

517
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
FAMILY.
HER YOUNGER SISTER KALE LEE.

518
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
HER OTHER SISTER JULIAN, HER

519
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
YOUNGER BROTHER.

520
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
KALE LEE AT ONE POINT ADDRESSED

521
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
THE CROWD, ADDRESSED ALL THE

522
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
MOURNERS WHO CAME OUT HERE.

523
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
AND SHE SAID SOMETHING SHE

524
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
TWEETED A LITTLE EARLIER.

525
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'M GOING TO READ IT TO YOU

526
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
BRIEFLY.
HUG YOUR LOVED ONES.

527
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
TELL THEM HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THEM

528
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN

529
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
YOU'LL SEE THEM AGAIN.

530
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
AND ONCE AGAIN, THE REASON WHY

531
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
THE FAMILY SAID THEY DECIDED TO

532
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
HOLD THIS VIGIL TONIGHT, WHY

533
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
THEY DECIDED TO RELEASE SOME OF

534
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
THE PICTURES THAT YOU SAW THERE

535
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
EARLIER OF VICKI SOTO IS THEY

536
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
DON'T WANT HER TO BE REMEMBERED

537
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
AS JUST A VICTIM, ANDERSON.

538
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
THEY WANT HER TO BE REMEMBERED

539
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
AS A WOMAN WHO WAS A DEDICATED

540
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
TEACHER, A WOMAN WHO WAS A

541
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
LOVING DAUGHTER, AND SOMEONE WHO

542
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
CARED FOR HER STUDENTS, SO MUCH

543
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
SO, ANDERSON, THAT SHE DIDN'T

544
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
EVEN REFER TO THEM AS STUDENTS,

545
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
SHE REFERRED TO THEM AS HER

546
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
CHILDREN.
ANDERSON?

547
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
>> I THINK SO MANY PARENTS WANT

548
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT THEIR

549
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
CHILD, ABOUT THEIR SIBLING.

550
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
IF IT'S A TEACHER OR A SCHOOL

551
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
ADMINISTRATOR AND REALLY WANT TO

552
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
HONOR THE LIFE THAT THEY LIVED.

553
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

554
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
POINT ABOUT NOT BEING REFERRED

555
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
TO AS A VICTIM, BUT AS A PERSON,

556
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
AS A SPIRIT WHO LIVED A

557
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
REMARKABLE LIFE.

558
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
AND IN THE CASE OF VICTORIA

559
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
SOTO, SACRIFICING HER LIFE TO

560
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
PROTECT HER STUDENTS, IT'S

561
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
EXTRAORDINARY.

562
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
YOU SPOKE WITH THE PARENTS OF A

563
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
YOUNG BOY WHO WAS IN VICTORIA

564
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
SOTO'S CLASS.

565
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF

566
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
PARENTS WHO ARE JUST SO THANKFUL

567
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
FOR ALL THE TEACHERS.

568
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I IMAGINE THEY WERE AS WELL.

569
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

570
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
THIS IS BRIANING ROBERT AND

571
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
DIANE LACATA.

572
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
THEY SAY IT'S IN PART HER QUICK

573
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
THINKING THAT'S PART OF THE

574
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
REASON WHY THEIR SON WAS ABLE TO

575
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
MAKE IT OUT OF THAT CLASSROOM

576
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
ALIVE, ANDERSON.

577
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
ALSO PART OF HIS OWN QUICK

578
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
THINKING AS SOMEHOW HE WAS ABLE,

579
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER

580
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
STUDENTS TO RUN DIRECTLY PAST

581
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
THE GUNMAN AS HE WAS IN THE

582
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
CLASSROOM AND RUN OUT OF THE

583
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
SCHOOL TO SAFETY.

584
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
AND A VERY EMOTIONAL INTERVIEW I

585
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
DID WITH THESE PARENTS TODAY,

586
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
THEY ALSO CONVEYED THAT HAIR

587
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
SON, FOLLOWING THIS HORRIFIC

588
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
DAY, THEIR SON VERY MUCH LOVED
HIS TEACHER.

589
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
>> HE'S REASSURING HIMSELF THAT

590
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
HE'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

591
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
HE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY CARED

592
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
ABOUT HIS TEACHER.

593
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
HE KEEPS SAYING I HOPE SHE'S

594
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
OKAY, I HOPE IT'S NOT HER.

595
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
ENOS THAT SHE'S BEEN HURT, BUT

596
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE END RESULT.

597
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
HE KNOWS THE KIDS THAT HE SAW

598
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
GETTING SHOT.

599
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE OUTCOME.

600
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
SO I THINK HE'S REASSURING

601
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
HIMSELF IN HIS 6-YEAR-OLD MIND.

602
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I KNOW HE'S PROCESSING IT, BUT I

603
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
THINK HE'S REASSURING HIMSELF.

604
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I THINK HE'S TELLING HIMSELF

605
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

606
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
>> I DID SPEND B TIME WITH THE

607
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
TWO OF THEM.

608
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
THEIR SON IS VERY SHAKEN.

609
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
THEY HAD TO PUT A SIGN ON THEIR

610
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
DOORBELL TO ASK PEOPLE NOT TO

611
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
RING THE DOORBELL BECAUSE EVERY

612
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
TIME IT RINGS, AIDEN THINKS IT'S

613
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
THE BAD GUY COMING TO GET HIM.

614
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
NOW, AS HARD AS THIS DAY HAS

615
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
BEEN FOR THEIR FAMILY, THEY ALSO
SAID TO ME THAT THEIR HEARTS

616
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
BREAK FOR THE SO MANY OTHER

617
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
FAMILIES THAT CANNOT GO HOME TO

618
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
HUG THEIR CHILDREN TONIGHT AND

619
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

620
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
MESSAGE WAS CONVEYED, INCLUDING

621
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
TO THE FAMILY OF VICTORIA SOTO.

622
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
>> THERE'S STILL A LOT ABOUT THE

623
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
CHAIN OF R OF EVENTS THAT WE

624
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
DON'T KNOW.

625
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
WE'RE TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER

626
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
THE PIECES AS BEST WE CAN.

627
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
AN UPDATE WHEN WE COME BACK.

628
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
[ Male Announcer ] THIS IS
JOE WOODS' FIRST DAY OF WORK.

629
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
AND HIS NEW BOSS TOLD HIM
TWO THINGS --

630
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
COOK WHAT YOU LOVE,
AND SAVE YOUR MONEY.

631
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
JOE DOESN'T KNOW IT YET,
BUT HE'LL WORK HIS WAY UP

632
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
FROM BUSSER TO WAITER TO CHEF
BEFORE OPENING A RESTAURANT

633
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
SPECIALIZING IN FISH AND GAME
FROM THE GREAT NORTHWEST.

634
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
HE'LL START INVESTING EARLY,

635
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
HE'LL FIND SOME GOOD PEOPLE
TO HELP GUIDE HIM,

636
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
AND HE'LL SET MONEY ASIDE
FROM HIS FIRST DAY OF WORK

637
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
TO HIS LAST,

638
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
WHICH ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

639
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.

640
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
FROM TD AMERITRADE.

641
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
>> THE FIRST SHOTS RANG OUT AT

642
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
THE SANDY HOOK SCHOOL JUST AS

643
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
THE MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE

644
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
BEING READ OVER THE LOUD

645
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
SPEAKER, AS PEOPLE COULD HEAR

646
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
THE SOUNDS OF THE SHOOTING OVER

647
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
THE LOUD SPEAKER.

648
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
TOM FOREMAN IS IN WASHINGTON

649
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
WITH THE LATEST INFORMATION ON

650
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
WHAT WE HAVE ABOUT HOW THE DAY

651
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
UNFOLDED INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.

652
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
TOM?

653
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
>> ANDERSON, POLICE ARE

654
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
ESSENTIALLY CONSTRUCTING A MAP

655
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
OF ALL OF THE PLACES THAT MIGHT

656
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
HAVE HAD CONNECTIONS TO THIS

657
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
SHOOTER.
FOR EXAMPLE, HIS BROTHER'S

658
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
APARTMENT DOWN HERE IN NEW

659
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
JERSEY.
ACROSS NEW YORK UP INTO

660
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
CONNECTICUT, HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE

661
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
WHERE SHE WAS FOUND DEAD.

662
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
AND ONLY ABOUT THREE MILES AWAY,

663
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
OF COURSE, THE SCHOOL.

664
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT LED

665
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
HIM TO THIS SPOT AT THAT TIME.

666
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
BECAUSE THEY DO BELIEVE THAT

667
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
SHORTLY AFTER MURDERING HIS

668
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
MOTHER, HE DID DRIVE THE FEW

669
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
MILES FROM HER HOUSE TO THIS

670
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
SCHOOL AND EMERGE IN THIS

671
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
PARKING LOT WITH WEAPONS VERY

672
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
MUCH LIKE THESE TO GO INTO THE

673
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
SCHOOL.

674
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
NOW, LET'S LOOK AT THE TIME LINE

675
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
OF WHAT HAPPENED.

676
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THEY'RE
TRYING TO RECONSTRUCT.

677
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
ABOUT 9:30 IN THE MORNING THAT'S

678
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
WHEN WE BELIEVE BASED ON

679
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS AND POLICE

680
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
RADIO THAT HE PROBABLY LEFT HIS

681
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
CAR.
WE THINK THIS IS THE ONE OVER

682
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
HERE, BASED ON THE
INVESTIGATION, AND CAME UP TO

683
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL.

684
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
THAT'S ALSO WHEN HE ENCOUNTERED

685
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
HIS FIRST OBSTACLES, BECAUSE

686
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
THIS IS WHERE THE SECURITY DOORS

687
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
WERE INSTALLED TO KEEP PEOPLE

688
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
OUT.
POLICE LATER SAID THE GLASS HAD

689
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
BEEN BROKEN OUT OF THESE.

690
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
THAT'S APPARENTLY HOW HE GOT

691
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
INTO THE SCHOOL WITH THOSE

692
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
WEAPONS.

693
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
WHAT WE KNOW IS BASED ON POLICE

694
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
REPORTS, BY 9:36 WE HAVE THE

695
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
FIRST CALLS INTO THE POLICE

696
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
STATION SAYING SHOOTING WAS

697
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
OCCURRING INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

698
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
EVERYBODY IN THE SCHOOL WAS

699
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
ALERT

700
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
ALERTED TO THE SOUNDS IN THE

701
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
SCHOOL.

702
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
AND THIS IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT.

703
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
BY 9:38, 2 TO 2 1/2 MINUTES

704
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
LATER, POLICE WERE SAYING IF NOT

705
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
ALL OF THE SHOOTING, THE BULK OF

706
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
THE SHOOTING WAS OVER.

707
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IN A

708
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
VERY SMALL AREA WHERE WHERE IT
ALL SEEMED TO OCCUR.

709
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?

710
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
WELL, IT PROGRESSED EVEN FURTHER

711
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
BY ABOUT 9:40 IN THE MORNING,

712
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
POLICE WERE CALLING FOR

713
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIANS TO

714
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
COME THERE, FOR AMBULANCES TO

715
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
COME.
A VERY FEW MINUTES LATER, THEY

716
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
CALLED FOR A WHOLE LOT MORE

717
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
AMBULANCES TO COME.

718
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
AND BY 9:50 OR SO IN THE

719
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
MORNING, THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY

720
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
SAYING THAT THE SCENE WAS

721
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
SECURE, THAT THEY HAD A SUSPECT

722
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
WHO WAS DOWN, THEY CLEARED THE

723
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
BUILDING AND MANY CHILDREN WERE

724
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
BEING LED OUT.

725
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
AS YOU CAN SEE THIS PHOTOGRAPH

726
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
FROM THE NEWTON B.

727
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
AND THE SITUATION WAS MORE OR

728
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
LESS SECURE.
THERE WAS STILL AN AWFUL LOT OF

729
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
WORK TO BE DONE, OBVIOUSLY, BUT

730
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
AS YOU CAN SEE, AS WE LOOK AT

731
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
THIS TIME LINE, CLOSER AND

732
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
CLOSER, IT REALLY IS COMING DOWN

733
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
TO A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME,

734
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
20 MINUTES OR LESS FROM THE

735
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
BEGINNING TO THE END OF THIS IN

736
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
TERMS OF PEOPLE REALLY KNOWING

737
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

738
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
AND NOW HUGE LONG, LONG SEARCH

739
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT HAPPENED.

740
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
ANDERSON?

741
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
>> APPRECIATE THAT.
THE LATEST INFORMATION THAT WE

742
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
HAVE.

743
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
AND AS I SAID, WE'RE TRYING TO

744
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
COLLECT PIECES OF INFORMATION AS

745
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
WE GET THEM AND BRING THEM TO

746
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
YOU.

747
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I WANT TO SHOW YOU A LIVE

748
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
PICTURE RIGHT NOW IN NEWTOWN.

749
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
A CANDLE LIGHT VIGIL.

750
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
TODAY AND LAST NIGHT.

751
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
PEOPLE GATHERING, PEOPLE JUST

752
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
WANT TO KIND OF BE TOGETHER.

753
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
AND SOMETIMES JUST BE TOGETHER

754
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
IN SILENCE, SOMETIMES TALK,

755
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
SOMETIMES JUST HUG AND CRY.

756
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
WE'VE SEEN ALL OF THAT IN THE

757
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
STREETS OF NEWTOWN.

758
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
WE ARE GETTING NEW INFORMATION

759
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
TONIGHT ABOUT THE FIRST PERSON

760
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
THAT WAS KILLED IN NEWTOWN.

761
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER, NANCY.

762
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
>> IT'S BECOME REALLY A PORTION

763
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
OF WHO THIS WOMAN WAS.

764
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
THE VINLS I SPOKE TO IN SOME OF

765
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN THIS AREA

766
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
PAINT A PICTURE OF THIS WOMAN

767
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
WHO ATTENDED THESE SORT OF

768
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
WEEKLY OR MONTHLY DICE GAMES IN

769
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
WHICH SHE WOULD GATHER WITH

770
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
RESIDENTS IN THIS COMMUNITY,

771
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
WHICH THEY DESCRIBE AS A

772
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
TIGHT-KNIT GROUPS WHO WOULD PLAY

773
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
THESE DICE GAMES, GARDEN AND

774
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
TALK ABOUT LANDSCAPING.

775
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
THE JOKE IS THAT THE HOUSE

776
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
BEHIND ME WHERE ALL OF THIS

777
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
INCIDENT TOOK PLACE IS SET BACK,

778
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
AND SHE WOULD TALK ABOUT DOING

779
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
THE LANDSCAPING IN THE BACK AND,

780
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
YOU KNOW, THE LANDSCAPE IS

781
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
REALLY NOTHING PEOPLE WOULD SEE.

782
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
IT PAINTS THIS PICTURE OF THIS

783
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
WOMAN WHO ATTENDED THESE SORT OF

784
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
PARLOR-LIKE GAMES AND YET AT THE

785
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
SAME TIME HAD THIS COLLECTION OF

786
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
GUNS, SOME OF WHICH WERE VERY

787
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
HIGH POWERED GUNS, LIKE THE

788
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
BUSHMASTER, SIMILAR TO WHAT

789
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
SOLDIERS IN IRAQ AND

790
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
AFGHANISTAN, SIMILAR TO THAT
TYPE OF WEAPON.

791
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
SO IT DOESN'T QUITE JIVE WITH

792
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
THE SCENE THAT THE NEIGHBORS

793
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
PAINT OF WHO THIS WOMAN WAS

794
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
DURING HER DAY TO DAY

795
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
INTERACTIONS WITH THEM.

796
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
SOMEONE WHO KEPT TO HERSELF, SHE

797
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
MOVED INTO THE AREA ABOUT 1998.

798
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
DIVORCED WITH HER HUSBAND YEARS

799
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
LATER.

800
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
AND HER TWO BOYS GREW UP HERE.

801
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
WHAT TRANSPIRED NEXT REALLY LED

802
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
TO THIS INCIDENT HAS ONLY RAISED

803
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
MORE QUESTIONS.

804
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
THAT'S SORT OF THE THING WE FIND

805
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
BEING HERE.

806
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
THE MORE QUESTIONS WE GET

807
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
ANSWERED THE MORE WE HAVE.

808
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
AND WHAT BROUGHT THIS TRAGEDY ON

809
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
THIS TOWN SUBPOENA NOT REALLY

810
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ANSWERED,

811
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
IT SEEMS.

812
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF

813
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
QUESTIONS IN THIS COMMUNITY AND

814
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
ELSEWHERE.
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY HAD

815
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
RECENTLY INSTALLED A NEW

816
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
SECURITY SYSTEM.

817
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
INCLUDING LOCKING THE DOORS AT

818
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
9:00 A.M.
THAT'S AROUND THE TIME THE

819
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
GUNMAN WAS ABLE TO FORCE HIS WAY

820
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
INTO THE BUILD, BUT THEY HAVEN'T

821
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
SAID EXACTLY HOW THEY GOT IN.

822
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
A FORMER NASSAU COUNTY NEW YORK

823
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
POLICE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR OF

824
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
THE ELITE INTELLIGENCE AND

825
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
PROTECTION, IS THERE ANY

826
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
SECURITY SYSTEM THAT, I MEAN,

827
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
PROTECTS SCHOOLS IN THIS WAY?

828
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
>> THERE ISN'T ONE THAT'S

829
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
DESIGNED TO.

830
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
YOU CAN FORT FIE THE DOORS,

831
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
UPGRADE THE LOCKS.

832
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
ONE I THINK EVERY SCHOOL SHOULD

833
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
CONSIDER, EVEN BEFORE THIS
INCIDENT WAS MAKING THESE

834
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
CLASSROOMS SAFE ROOMS IN A

835
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
SENSE.

836
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
BY FORTIFYING THE CLASSROOM

837
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
DPOORS, KEEPING THEM LOCKED AT

838
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
ALL TIMES AND UPGRADING A LOCK

839
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
SYSTEM.
YOU COULD CREATE A SOMEWHAT

840
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
SAFER ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM IN AN

841
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
INSTANCE LIKE THIS.

842
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TURNING

843
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
OUR CLASSROOMS INTO SOMEWHAT

844
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
FORTIFIED --
>> THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.

845
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
>> THAT'S A KNEE-JERK REACTION.

846
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT ARMED POLICE

847
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
OFFICERS IN ALL OUR SCHOOLS.

848
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
THAT'S JUST NOT FEASIBLE.

849
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN

850
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
EMOTIONALLY HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT

851
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
FOR KIDS TO LEARN IN EITHER.

852
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
>> A LOT OF SCHOOLS WERE

853
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
DESIGNED TO BE OPEN PLACES, OPEN

854
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
FOR TEACHERS, OPEN FOR STUDENTS.

855
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
AND NOW THEY'RE STARTING TO HAVE

856
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
TO RETHINK THAT, TO NOT HAVE THE

857
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
ARCHITECTURE OF THE SCHOOL BE

858
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
QUITE SO OPEN.
>> UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE

859
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
REGRESSING IS WHAT THIS COMES

860
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
DOWN TO.

861
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
THESE ARE INSTITUTIONS WHERE WE

862
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
LEARN, WHERE WE ABSORB

863
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
KNOWLEDGE, WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED

864
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
TO BE SAFE IN DOING THAT OR

865
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
EXPERIENCING THAT PROCESS.

866
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THE

867
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
DETERIORATI

868
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
DETERIORATION OF THE CULTURE.

869
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
THIS IS A DIFFERENT FORMAT OF
THE GUN.

870
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
WE HAVE ISSUES HERE ABOUT

871
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
FAILING TO SAFEGUARD THESE

872
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
WEAPONS.
>> THE POLICE SAY A WOMAN WHO

873
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
WAS WOUNDED AT THE SCHOOL IS

874
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
GOING TO BE INSTRUMENTAL TO THE

875
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
INVESTIGATION.

876
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
AT THIS POINT, WHAT ARE POLICE

877
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
DOING?
>> THEY'RE CONTINUING THIS

878
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
INVESTIGATION.

879
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE GATHERING

880
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
EVIDENCE.
THEY'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE

881
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
CONCLUSIVELY IF HE ACTED A I

882
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
LOAN.
THEY HAVE TO DO THAT.
THEY'RE PREPARING FOR POSSIBLY

883
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
ANY FUTURE COURT CASES.

884
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
THEY'RE DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT

885
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
THINGS.
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT

886
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
EXACTLY WHAT TRANSPIRED IN THAT

887
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
CLASSROOM.
DID HE LEAVE US ANY MESSAGES,

888
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
VERBALLY, WRITTEN, COMPUTER, SO

889
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
ON AND SO FORTH.

890
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO VET THIS

891
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
ENTIRE INCIDENT TO FIND OUT WHAT

892
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
MAY HAVE PRECIPITATED IT.

893
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
BEYOND THE PARE

894
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
>> BEYOND THE PARENTS, I THINK
OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS.

895
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
THIS IS A CRIME SCENE.

896
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
YOU KNOW, I SHUTTER TO THINK OF

897
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
WHAT THAT CRIME SCENE LOOKS

898
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
LIKE.

899
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
BUT THEY HAVE TO CATALOG IT.

900
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
THEY HAVE TO DOCUMENT IT.

901
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
>> YEAH.

902
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THE

903
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
EMOTIONALLY, THE TOLL THIS TAKES

904
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.
AS A RULE, WE DEAL WITH THE

905
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
UNDERBELLY OF OUR SOCIETY AND

906
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
PART OF OUR EXERCISE IS TO
INSULATE THE GENERAL PUBLIC FROM

907
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
HOW DARK THIS GETS.

908
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
THESE MEN OR WOMEN WENT INTO

909
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
THIS ROOM LOOKING AT THESE

910
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
CHILDREN THAT WERE BASICALLY

911
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
SLAUGHTERED, SHOT MULTIPLE

912
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
TIMES.
THESE ARE BABIES.

913
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
OUR BABIES.

914
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
>> I APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH

915
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
US.

916
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I'M SORRY IT'S UNDER THESE

917
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
CIRCUMSTANCES.
WE HAVE A LOT AHEAD.

918
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
WE'RE TRYING TO GET AS MUCH

919
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
INFORMATION AS WE CAN.

920
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
WE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A SHORT

921
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
BREAK.
[ Male Announcer ]
IT'S SIMPLE PHYSICS...

922
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
A BODY AT REST
TENDS TO STAY AT REST...

923
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
WHILE A BODY IN MOTION
TENDS TO STAY IN MOTION.

924
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
STAYING ACTIVE CAN ACTUALLY
EASE ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS.

925
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
BUT IF YOU HAVE ARTHRITIS,

926
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
STAYING ACTIVE
CAN BE DIFFICULT.

927
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
PRESCRIPTION CELEBREX
CAN HELP RELIEVE ARTHRITIS PAIN

928
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
SO YOUR BODY
CAN STAY IN MOTION.

929
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
BECAUSE JUST ONE
200MG CELEBREX A DAY

930
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
CAN PROVIDE 24 HOUR RELIEF

931
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
FOR MANY WITH ARTHRITIS PAIN
AND INFLAMMATION.

932
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
PLUS, IN CLINICAL STUDIES,

933
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
CELEBREX IS PROVEN TO IMPROVE
DAILY PHYSICAL FUNCTION

934
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
SO MOVING IS EASIER.

935
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
CELEBREX CAN BE TAKEN WITH
OR WITHOUT FOOD.

936
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
AND IT'S NOT A NARCOTIC.

937
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR
SHOULD BALANCE THE BENEFITS

938
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
WITH THE RISKS.

939
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
ALL PRESCRIPTION NSAIDS,
LIKE CELEBREX, IBUPROFEN,

940
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
NAPROXEN, AND MELOXICAM

941
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
HAVE THE SAME
CARDIOVASCULAR WARNING.

942
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
THEY ALL MAY INCREASE
THE CHANCE

943
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
OF HEART ATTACK OR STROKE,
WHICH CAN LEAD TO DEATH.

944
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
THIS CHANCE INCREASES
IF YOU HAVE HEART DISEASE

945
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
OR RISK FACTORS
SUCH AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE

946
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
OR WHEN NSAIDS ARE TAKEN
FOR LONG PERIODS.

947
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
NSAIDS, INCLUDING CELEBREX,

948
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
INCREASE THE CHANCE OF SERIOUS
SKIN OR ALLERGIC REACTIONS

949
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
OR STOMACH AND INTESTINE
PROBLEMS,

950
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
SUCH AS BLEEDING AND ULCERS,

951
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
WHICH CAN OCCUR WITHOUT WARNING
AND MAY CAUSE DEATH.

952
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
PATIENTS ALSO TAKING ASPIRIN
AND THE ELDERLY

953
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR
STOMACH BLEEDING AND ULCERS.

954
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
DO NOT TAKE CELEBREX IF YOU'VE
HAD AN ASTHMA ATTACK, HIVES,

955
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
OR OTHER ALLERGIES TO ASPIRIN,
NSAIDS OR SULFONAMIDES.

956
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
GET HELP RIGHT AWAY IF YOU HAVE
SWELLING OF THE FACE OR THROAT,

957
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
OR TROUBLE BREATHING.

958
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR
YOUR MEDICAL HISTORY

959
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
AND FIND AN ARTHRITIS TREATMENT
FOR YOU.

960
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
VISIT CELEBREX.COM AND ASK
YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT CELEBREX.

961
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
FOR A BODY IN MOTION.

962
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
>> THIS IS A VERY, VERY TRAGIC.

963
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
CERTAINLY OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN
FOR THE FAMILIES HERE.

964
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
>> ABOUT 9:30, 9:40, WE HEARD

965
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
NOISES AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT

966
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
SYSTEM WAS SO ON.

967
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
IT DIDN'T GO OFF SO YOU COULD

968
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
HEAR WHAT SOUNDED LIKE POPS,

969
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
GUNSHOTS.

970
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
>> HER TEACHER MANAGED TO TAKE

971
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
TWO CHILDREN OUT OF THE HALL
WAY, PULL THEM INTO THE

972
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
CLASSROOM, LOCKED THE DOOR AND

973
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
MOVE EVERYBODY OVER TO THE OTHER

974
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
SIDE OF THE ROOM.

975
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
>> WE JUST TOLD A LITTLE BOY

976
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
ABOUT HIS SISTER NOW.

977
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
JUST TO SEE HIS HEART, WHO AM I

978
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
GOING TO PLAY WITH, HE SAID?

979
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
>> WHEN YOUR FIRST GRADER GOES

980
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
TO BED AND SAYS MOMMY, ANYONE

981
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
FROM MY CLASS LAST YEAR, ARE

982
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
THEY ALL OKAY?

983
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
AND YOU LOOK AT THEM AND SAY I'M

984
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
NOT REALLY SURE.

985
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
>> YOU CAN NEVER BE PREPARED FOR

986
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
THIS KIND OF INCIDENT.

987
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
WHAT HAS HAPPENED, WHAT HAS

988
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
TRANSPIRED AT THAT SCHOOL

989
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
BUILDING WILL LEAVE A MARK ON

990
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
THIS COMMUNITY AND EVERY FAMILY

991
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
IMPACTED.

992
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
>> SOME WANT TO GRIEVE IN

993
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
SILENCE, OTHERS WANT TO TALK,

994
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
TALK TO THE MEDIA, LOVED ONES,

995
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
TALK TO EVEN STRANGERS ON

996
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
STREETS.
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE GATHERED

997
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
OUT TONIGHT, EVEN THOUGH IT'S

998
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
VERY COLD.
YOU WERE ACTUALLY AT ONE OF THE

999
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
PLACES, A KIND OF GATHERING

1000
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
POINT FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO
TALK TO COUNSELORS.

1001
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
AND WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

1002
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW

1003
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
WHAT TO EXPECT.

1004
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT WAS SO RAW

1005
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
STILL.
I DIDN'T KNOW IF PEOPLE WERE

1006
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
GOING TO GO TO THIS CENTER.

1007
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
WHEN WE GOT THERE, THERE WAS

1008
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
LITERALLY 100 CARS IN THE

1009
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
PARKING LOT.

1010
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
AND OUT OF RESPECT FOR PEOPLE'S

1011
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
PRIVACY, WE WEREN'T FILMING

1012
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
ANYTHING.
BUT PEOPLE WERE WALKING OUT WITH

1013
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
CHILDREN.
PROBABLY CHILDREN FROM THE

1014
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
SCHOOL.
A LOT OF PARENTS WALKING WITH

1015
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
THEM INTO THE SCHOOL AND THERE

1016
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
WERE PSYCHIATRIST,

1017
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS, CHILDREN'S

1018
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
COUNSELORS IN THE SCHOOL.

1019
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I THINK WHAT WAS REALLY STRIKING

1020
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
IS PEOPLE WERE GOING IN AND

1021
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
STAYING IN FOR A LONG TIME.

1022
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I MEAN, THIS WAS A, I'M SURE,

1023
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
GRIEVING, BUT ALSO HEALING GOING
ON.

1024
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
AND ALSO THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT

1025
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
THE COMMUNITY WAS SORT OF AN

1026
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
INDIVIDUAL.

1027
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
MEANING THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU SAW

1028
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
THAT SOMEONE ELSE WAS GOING

1029
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
THROUGH THE SAME THING YOU WERE.

1030
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
AND PEOPLE WERE BEING COMFORTED

1031
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
BY THAT IN SOME WAYS.

1032
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
>> IT'S INTERESTING, I WAS

1033
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
TALKING TO MY MOM WHO LOST A

1034
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
SON, MY BROTHER.

1035
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
AND SHE WAS SAYING FOR HER, IT

1036
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
HELPED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

1037
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
AND I'VE HEARD THAT FROM A LOT

1038
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
OF PEOPLE HERE, THAT IT HELPS TO

1039
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
TALK.
YET OTHER PEOPLE AREN'T READY TO

1040
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
TALK ABOUT IT OR CAN'T TALK

1041
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
ABOUT IT.

1042
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
>> YEAH.
I THINK THE TIMING SEEMS TO BE

1043
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

1044
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
WHICH IS WHY I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

1045
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
TO EXPECT.
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THIS COMMUNITY

1046
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
FOR THE MOST PART IS READY TO

1047
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
TALK.
I MEAN, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A

1048
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
SMALL SAMPLE SIZE, BUT PEOPLE

1049
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
ARE TALKING ABOUT IT.

1050
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
AND THE FEELING OF ISOLATION,

1051
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
THINKING THAT I'M GOING THROUGH

1052
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
THIS ALONE, THAT NO ONE QUITE

1053
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
UNDERSTANDS WHAT THIS HAS DONE

1054
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
TO ME CAN BE QUITE PAINFUL AND

1055
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
QUITE DAMAGING LONG TERM AS

1056
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
WELL.

1057
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
SO IF YOU SEE OTHER PEOPLE GOING

1058
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
THROUGH IT, AND EVEN JUST BEING

1059
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
THERE IN THE CRISIS CENTER WITH

1060
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
OTHER PEOPLE, I THINK IS ASSUMED

1061
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
TO BE SOMEWHAT THERAPEUTIC.

1062
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
>> OTHER PATIENTS AROUND THE

1063
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
WORLD ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

1064
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
HOW TO TALK TO THEIR KIDS ABOUT

1065
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
IT.

1066
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I TALKED TO PARENTS LAST NIGHT

1067
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
WHOSE KIDS WERE IN THE SCHOOL

1068
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
AND THANKFULLY SURVIVED, THEY

1069
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
WERE WAITING FOR THEIR CHILDREN

1070
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
TO KIND OF BRING IT UP TO THEM.

1071
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
THAT'S WIN WAY TO DO IT.

1072
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
>> OBVIOUSLY THE CHILDREN IN THE

1073
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
SCHOOL KNOW.

1074
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
OTHER CHILDREN IN THE COMMUNITY

1075
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
KNOW, EVEN IF THEY HADN'T BEEN

1076
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
WATCHING TELEVISION, IN TODAY'S

1077
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
DAY AND AGE.
THE THING THAT KEEPS COMING BACK

1078
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
IS THEY SORT OF DIRECT THE

1079
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
CONVERSATION.

1080
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
YOU SORT OF GET YOUR OWN

1081
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
FEELINGS IN CHECK FIRST AS AN

1082
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
ADULT OR AS A PARENT, AND THEN

1083
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
YOU FILL IN DETAILS AS

1084
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
APPROPRIATE.

1085
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
AS AGE FROEPT.

1086
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
-- APPROPRIATE.

1087
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
LEAVING OUT GRAPHIC DETAILS.

1088
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
BUT THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT YOU

1089
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
DON'T WANT TO BE FALSE OR YOU

1090
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
WANT TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT.

1091
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH MY

1092
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
DAUGHTER.
THE FIRST THING SHE ASKED ME,

1093
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
SHE STARTED ASKING ME ABOUT SOME

1094
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
OF THE NAMES OF THE CHILDREN.

1095
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I THINK THAT'S INTERESTING.
THEY IMMEDIATELY WANT TO

1096
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
HUMANIZE THIS.

1097
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
IT WAS A TOUGH CONVERSATION TO

1098
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
HAVE.
SHE WANTED TO KNOW IF HER SCHOOL

1099
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
WAS GOING TO BE SAFE. I HAVE TO

1100
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
SAY LOOK, DADDY'S SCHOOL NEVER

1101
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
HAD THIS HAPPEN TO THEM.

1102
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
MOMMY'S SCHOOL NEVER HAPPENED TO

1103
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
HER.

1104
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
WE DO THE BEST WE CAN TO KEEP

1105
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
YOU SAFE.CONVERSATIONS.

1106
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
>> YESTERDAY, THERE WERE REPORTS

1107
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
THE SHOOTER'S BROTHER HAD SAID

1108
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
THAT HE HAD A PERSONALITY

1109
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
DISORDER.

1110
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
MAYBE HE WAS SOMEWHERE ON

1111
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
AUTOTICHL SPECTRUM.

1112
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
THOSE ARE TWO SEPARATE THINGS.

1113
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
AND I HAD NEVER HEARD OF AUTISM

1114
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
BEING ANYTHING TO DO WITH A

1115
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
PREPLANNED ACT OF VIOLENCE.

1116
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

1117
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
CHILDREN WHO ARE UH TISIC ARE

1118
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
UPSET THAT THE WORD AUTISM IS

1119
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
EVEN BEING MENTIONED IN

1120
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
RELATIONSHIP TO THIS.

1121
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
>> I'M GLAD YOU SAID IT BECAUSE,

1122
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
YOU KNOW, I LOOKED THIS UP AGAIN

1123
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
TODAY.
I TALKED TO SOME OF MY EXPERTS I

1124
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
TALK TO IN THIS SORT OF THING.

1125
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE AT ALL,

1126
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST

1127
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
THAT SOMEONE ON THE AUTISM

1128
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
SPECTRUM IS -- IT COULD BE

1129
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
PREPLANNED VIOLENCE.

1130
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
AND PEOPLE HAVE VIOLENT

1131
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
OUTBURSTS SOMETIMES, REACTIVE

1132
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
VIOLENCE.
BUT PREPLANNED VIOLENCE JUST

1133
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S

1134
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS.

1135
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I TRIED TO MAKE THAT CLEAR ALL

1136
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
DAY.
I HEARD THAT SAME THING.

1137
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
THERE'S JUST NO EVIDENCE OF THAT

1138
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
WHATSOEVER.
ALSO THIS WHOLE NOTION, YOU

1139
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
KNOW, ASBERGER,

1140
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
WHATEVER, THAT'S SOMETHING

1141
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
THAT'S A NEURODEVELOPMENTAL

1142
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
DISORDER.

1143
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
IT'S NOT A PERSONALITY DISORDER.

1144
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
THE IT'S NOT A MENTAL ILLNESS.

1145
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
IT'S A NEURODEVELOPAL DISORDER.

1146
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
>> I HOPE THAT CLARIFIES IT.

1147
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
THAT'S SOMETHING WE WILL TRY TO

1148
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
REPEAT AS MUCH AS WE CAN.

1149
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANYONE A

1150
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
FALSE IMPRESSION ABOUT KIDS WITH

1151
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
AUTISM.

1152
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
AND AGAIN, THERE'S STILL SO MUCH

1153
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE MENTAL

1154
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
STATE OF THIS GUNMAN.

1155
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
SANJAY, APPRECIATE IT.
GOING TO HAVE MORE WITH SANJAY

EDITION OF "360."

1158
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF

1159
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
INFORMATION WE'RE TRYING TO GO

1160
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
THROUGH.
ALSO GETTING NEW INFORMATION.

1161
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
ACTUALLY, I DO WANT TO ASK YOU

1162
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
BRIEFLY ABOUT -- THERE'S SOME

1163
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
INFORMATION ON SECRETARY OF

1164
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
STATE HILLARY CLINTON, THAT SHE

1165
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
FELL AND POSSIBLY HAD A

1166
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
CONCUSSION.
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?
>> EARLIER THIS WEEK, SHE WAS

1167
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
DEALING WITH A STOMACH VIRUS.

1168
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
SHE FAINTED.

1169
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
WHEN SHE FAINTED SHE HIT HER

1170
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
HEAD.

1171
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
JUST TODAY NOW, THEY SAY SHE

1172
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
LIKELY HAD A CONCUSSION.

1173
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
SO IT TOOK A FEW DAYS TO

1174
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
ACTUALLY CLARIFY THAT AND MAKE

1175
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
THAT DIAGNOSIS.

1176
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
SO THE DOCTORS HAVE RECOMMENDED

1177
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
THAT IT'S OKAY FOR HER TO BE AT

1178
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
HOME.

1179
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

1180
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I THINK THEY HAVE A LOW

1181
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
THRESHOLD FOR HER BEING IN THE

1182
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
HOSPITAL.

1183
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH HER

1184
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
BEING AT HOME, BUT ALSO SAYING

1185
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
NO STRENUOUS ACTIVITY AND REALLY

1186
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
NO WORK.

1187
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
WITH A CONCUSSION, YOU WANT TO

1188
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
MAKE SURE THAT THE BRAIN IS SORT

1189
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
OF RESTED.

1190
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000

1192
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000

1194
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I' NOT SURE SHE'S SOMEONE

1195
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
CAPABLE OF DOING THAT, FRANKLY,

1196
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE

1197
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000

00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
DO WE LOCK AND TURN LIGHTS OFF,

1273
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
CLOSE WINDOWS?

1274
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
>> CERTAINLY THERE ARE A HOST OF

1275
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
THINGS THAT WE WOULD DO IN AN

1276
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
ENERGY.
THAT WOULD INCLUDE LOCKING

1277
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
DOORS, TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

1278
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
ABLE TO FORTIFY THAT ENTRANCE

1279
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
WAY AS BEST AS WE CAN.

1280
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
AGAIN, IF THERE ARE NO SAFE

1281
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
ALTERNATIVES FOR EVACUATING THE

1282
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
BUILDING.

1283
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
AND THAT WAY IF SOMEONE WAS TO

1284
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
WALK BY THE ROOM, THEY WOULDN'T

1285
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
HAVE AN EASY PICTURE OF ANYONE

1286
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
THAT IS IN THE ROOM.

1287
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
>> ADULTS IN THE ROOM, HE SAYS,

1288
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
SHOULD TALK THE KIDS THROUGH IT

1289
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
AS CALMLY AS POSSIBLE.

1290
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
>> WHAT ABOUT LARGE ROOMS LIKE

1291
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
GYMS?
GO IN?

1292
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
AVOID IT?

1293
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
>> THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PLACES

1294
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
TO CONCEAL YOURSELVES AS YOU SEE

1295
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
THERE.
BUT THERE'S A WAY TO GET TO THE

1296
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING.

1297
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
>> WE WANT TO ADD ANOTHER VOICE

1298
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT

1299
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
SAFETY.
HECTOR GARCIA HAS ENDEVOTED MUCH

1300
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
OF HIS PROFESSIONAL LIFE AS A

1301
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
FORMER SCHOOL POLICE KMEEF.

1302
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
HE JOINS ME NOW FROM WEST PALM

1303
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
BEACH, FLORIDA.

1304
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US.

1305
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
WE MADE OBVIOUSLY STRIDES SINCE

1306
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
THE COLUMBINE SCHOOL SHOOTING

1307
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
BACK IN '99.

1308
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
BUT WHERE ARE WE NOW AND WHAT

1309
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
MORE DO YOU THINK NEEDS TO BE

1310
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
DONE?
>> FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU,

1311
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,000
ANDERSON, FOR HAVING ME.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD

1312
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
ADVOCATE FOR IS ONCE AGAIN A

1313
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
RESURGENCE OF THE GRANTS THAT

1314
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
WERE FRO PROVIDED BY A FEDERAL

1315
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
GOVERNMENT THAT EFFECTUATED SO

1316
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
MANY OF THESE TRAINING SESSIONS

1317
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
FOR OUR SCHOOLCHILDREN AND STAFF

1318
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
MEMBERS THAT THEY PERFORMED SO

1319
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
ADMIRABLY DURING THESE TRAGIC

1320
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
TIMES AS A RESULT OF THAT

1321
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
TRAINING THAT WAS ADMINISTERED

1322
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
UNDER GRANT PROGRAMS.

1323
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
ANYTHING, OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS,

1324
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
PUTTING POLICE OFFICERS IN

1325
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
SCHOOLS WHERE THEY CAN ADVOCATE

1326
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
ALSO AND BE PROTECTORS OF

1327
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
SCHOOLS HAVE FALLEN ON TO BUDGET

1328
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
CUTS AS WELL.

1329
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT COME

1330
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
BACK INTO EFFECT.

1331
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
IN ADDITION THERE HAVE BEEN MANY

1332
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
STUDIES GRANTED BY THE U.S.

1333
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
SECRET SERVICE.

1334
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
THERE ARE MANY ADVOCACY GROUP, A

1335
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
SAFETY ADVOCACY COUNCIL,

1336
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
NATIONAL SERASSOCIATION OF SCHO

1337
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO ALL

1338
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
CAME TOGETHER AND DREW UPON THE

1339
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
BEST PRACTICES AND THE LESSONS

1340
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
LEARNED AND DEVELOPED MANY OF

1341
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
THESE PLANS.

1342
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A

1343
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
RESURGENCE OF THAT AGAIN SO WE

1344
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
CAN HONE WHAT WE HAVE NOW AND

1345
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
MAKE IT EVEN BETTER BECAUSE THAT

1346
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS VITAL IN

1347
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
THIS TRAGEDY.

1348
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
>> I THINK IT'S A GOOD POINT YOU

1349
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
RAISED IN THE TRAINING.

1350
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I WAS AMAZED, THE TEACHERS I

1351
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
TALKED TO, JUST HOW THEY HAD

1352
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
DRILLED FOR SOME SORT OF AN

1353
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
EVENT, WHETHER IT WAS LIKE THIS

1354
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
OR SOME SORT OF EMERGENCY EVENT.

1355
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
THEY GOT THE KIDS INTO THE

1356
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
CORNERS.
IN ONE CASE, THE TEACHERS SAT

1357
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
THE KIDS DOWN AND READ TO THEM

1358
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
TO KIND OF KEEP THEM CALM AND

1359
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
CONTINUED TO READ ALL THE WAY

1360
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
THROUGH THIS UNTIL S.W.A.T. TEAM

1361
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
MEMBERS KNOCKED ON THE DOOR AND

1362
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
TOLD EVERYBODY IT WAS OKAY TO

1363
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
COME OUT.

1364
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
HOW WIDESPREAD IS THAT KIND OF

1365
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
STRAINING IN SCHOOLS ACROSS THE

1366
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
COUNTRY.

1367
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
>> WELL, ANDERSON, THIS TRAINING

1368
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
IS NOW MANDATORY IN SO MANY

1369
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
STATES.
AND I BELIEVE THAT IT IS

1370
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
WIDESPREAD THROUGHOUT THE

1371
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
COUNTRY.

1372
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
NOW, THE FREQUENCY OF THE

1373
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
TRAINING IS CRITICAL.

1374
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
THE LARGER SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

1375
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
GOING TO DO MORE TRAINING AND

1376
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
MORE DRILLS AND THEREFORE BE

1377
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
BETTER PREPARED.

1378
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I QUESTION THOSE PRIVATE

1379
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
SCHOOLS, THOSE PRIVATE
INSTITUTIONS, MAYBE THE SMALLER

1380
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
ONES THAT ARE NOT REALLY FOC

1381
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
FOCUSING ON THIS AS MUCH TO

1382
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
REALLY STEP UP TO THE PLATE.

1383
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
AND ALSO COME TO THE SAME LEVELS

1384
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
OF FREQUENCY OF TRAINING AND

1385
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
DRILLING.
AND OF ALSO REVIEWING, AS THE

1386
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
EXPERTS SAID EARLIER, THOSE EXIT

1387
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
PLANS.
HAVE THINGS CHANGED AROUND THEIR

1388
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
NEIGHBORHOODS?

1389
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LIVE

1390
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
THIS -- MAKE IT A LIVING

1391
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
DOCUMENT AND CONTINUE TO EVOLVE

1392
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
AND TO MASTER THAT CRISIS PLAN

1393
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
AND DRILL IT DOWN, DRILL IT

1394
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
DOWN, ALL THE WAY TO THE

1395
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
TEACHERS AND EVEN THE PARENTS

1396
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
WHO MAY BE THERE.

1397
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
>> I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPERTISE.

1398
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
THE TRAGEDY IN THIS COMMUNITY

1399
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
HAS TOUCHED PEOPLE AROUND THE

1400
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
WORLD.
THIS HAS MADE THE FRONT PAGE OF

1401
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
PAPERS ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

1402
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
IN ENGLAND, SEVERAL SOCCER TEAMS

1403
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
WORE BLACK ARM BANDS TO HONOR

1404
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
THE VICTIMS.

1405
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
ONE TEAM NOTED THE TRIBUTE WAS

1406
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
AT THE REQUEST OF THE PLAYER

1407
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
THEMSELVES.

1408
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE PICTURES
FROM BRAZIL.

1409
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
BLACK CROSSES FOR EACH OF THE

1410
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
VICTIMS IN RIO DEJANEIRO.

1411
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
MANY NEWSPAPERS COMPARED IT TO

1412
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
TRAGEDIES THAT UNFOLDED ON THEIR

1413
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
OWN SOIL.
AND SOME SPECULATED WHETHER THIS

1414
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
COULD BE THE EVENT THAT SHIFTS

1415
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
AMERICA'S ATTITUDE ON GUN

1416
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
CONTROL, EITHER BECAUSE OF THE

1417
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
AGE OF THE VICTIMS OR BECAUSE

1418
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
AMERICANS CAN ONLY TOLERATE SO

1419
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
MANY SENSELESS DEATHS FROM GUN

1420
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000
VIOLENCE.

1421
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
BE RIGHT BACK.

1422
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
>>> THIS IS CNN.

1423
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
THIS EVENING, A COMMUNITY IN

1424
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
SHOCK AND MOURNING, JUST ONE DAY

1425
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
AFTER AN HORRIFIC EVENT THAT
