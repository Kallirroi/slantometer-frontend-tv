1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
THAT KNOCK DOWN DRAGOUT FIGHT

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
STARTED AS COMEDY BUT QUICKLY IT

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
TURNED VERY VERY REAL.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
MASCOTS GETTING VIOLENT.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
THE RAM AND THE PANTHER PULLING

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
EACH OTHER TO THE GROUND AND

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
THROWING PUNCHES.
THE HALFTIME BRAWL DIDN'T END

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
UNTIL OTHERS STEPPED IN TO PULL

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
THE MASCOTS APART, BUT DON'T

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
WORRY.
THE RAM AND THE PANTHER WERE NOT

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
HURT.
THAT'S THE LAST CALL.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
TONIGHT.
SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
GO TO GRETAWIRE.COM.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
THERE'S AN OPEN THREAD.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
TELL US WHAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
TONIGHT'S SHOW.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
GRETAWEAR.COM.
GOODNIGHT FROM WASHINGTON.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
>> Eric: THIS IS A FOX NEWS

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
ALERT.
WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS ON TWO

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
BIG STORIES AT THIS HOUR.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
YOU ARE LOOKING LIVE AT THE

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
WHITE HOUSE WHERE PRESIDENT

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
OBAMA AND HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
BOEHNER ARE ABOUT TO MEET TO

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
DISCUSS THE LOOMING FISCAL

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
CLIFF.

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
THIS IS A SURPRISE MEETING,

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
ONE THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT A

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
SHORT TIME AGO.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
BOEHNER IS MAKING HIS WAY OVER

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
THERE RIGHT NOW.

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
THE OTHER BREAKING NEWS IS

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
THAT U.N. AMBASSADOR SUSAN

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
RICE JUST REMOVED HER NAME

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
FROM CONSIDERATION FOR THE

37
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
COVETED SECRETARY OF STATE

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
JOB, FOLLOWING THE THEORY OVER

39
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
HER RESPONSE TO THE ATTACK ON

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
THE CONSULATE IN BENGHAZI.

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
ED HENRY HAS MORE ON BOTH

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
BREAKING STORIES.

43
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
TAKE IT AWAY.
>> Reporter: YOU ARE RIGHT.

44
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER LEFT THE

45
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
CAPITAL AND EXPECTED TO ARRIVE

46
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN A

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
MOMENT.

48
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
THIS COULD NOT PUT MORE

49
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
EXPLANATION POINT HOW CRITICAL

50
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
THIS MEETING IS.
WE ARE RUNNING UP AGAINST THE

51
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
FISCAL CLIFF.
WE HEARD FROM FIRMS THAT

52
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
UNLESS A FRAMEWORK FOR A DEAL

53
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
IS FORGED IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS

54
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
THEY ARE GOING TO RUN OUT OF

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
TIME IN ORDER ACTUALLY MOVE

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
WHATEVER DEAL THEY COME UP

57
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
WITH THROUGH BOTH CHANGES TO

58
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE.

59
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
THIS IS WHY I GOT NEW

60
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
INFORMATION THAT LAST NIGHT

61
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
REID MET IN A PRIVATE DINNER

63
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
AND HE WAS SAYING HE BELIEVES

64
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET

65
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
THE FISCAL CLIFF DEAL DONE

66
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

67
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
WHAT THEY ARE FOCUSED ON IS A

68
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
SO-CALLED PLAN "B" WHERE THE

69
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
HOUSE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS MAY

70
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
PASS EXTENSION OF THE MIDDLE

71
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
CLASS TAX CUTS.

72
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THE OLD BUSH TAX CUTS.

73
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
THEN LET THE TAX RATES FOR THE

74
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
RICH GO UP AND FIGHT IT OUT IN

75
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OVER

76
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
SPENDING CUTS.

77
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
WE'LL SEE WHETHER OR NOT

78
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
CONSERVATIVE GOES ALONG WITH

79
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
THAT, IF SPEAKER BOEHNER WAS

80
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
PARTY TO THAT.

81
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
THE SECOND BIG STORY IS SUSAN

82
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
RICE.

83
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS

84
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
CALLING THE PRESIDENT AND

85
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
SAYING SHE IS PULLING HER NAME

86
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR

87
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
SECRETARY OF STATE, ALL

88
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
BECAUSE OF THE CONTROVERSY

89
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
OVER BENGHAZI, HER REACTION TO

90
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
THE TERROR ATTACK, WHETHER OR

91
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
NOT SHE MISLED THE PUBLIC.

92
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
BOTTOM LINE THIS PUTS JOHN

93
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
KERRY, DEMOCRATIC SOURCES SAY,

94
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
AS THE LIKELY CONTENDER TO BE

95
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
SECRETARY OF STATE I'M SEEING

96
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
THE SUVs PULL UP WITH

97
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER RIGHT NOW.

98
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
BOTH THE STORIES BREAKING

99
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
RIGHT AS WE SPEAK.

100
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
YOU WILL SEE SPEAKER BOEHNER

101
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
IN A MOMENT.

102
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
BUT BOTTOM LINE IS YOU WILL

103
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
REMEMBER AT THE POST ELECTION

104
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
NEWS CONFERENCE, THE PRESIDENT

105
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
MADE A BIG DEAL ABOUT STANDING

106
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
UP FOR SUSAN RICE.

107
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
SAYING THAT BASICALLY, SHE

108
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
WAS --
[ INAUDIBLE ]

109
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
NOT GOING TO STAND FOR ATTACKS

110
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
THREATENED FILIBUSTER.

111
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
THIS IS A CAVE-IN BY THE

112
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
PRESIDENT.
HE GAVE IN TO THE CRITICS ON

113
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
THE HILL.

114
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
SUSAN RICE MAY NOT BE

115
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
DISAPPEARING.
IT POSTED A STORY SAYING THE

116
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
TOP DEMOCRATS SAY SHE MAY BE

117
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
THE NEXT NATIONAL SECURITY

118
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
ADVISOR HERE INSIDE THE WHITE

119
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
HOUSE.

120
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
SIGNIFICANT THAT THE PRESIDENT

121
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
APPOINTS HER TO THAT, DOESN'T

122
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
NEED SENATE CONFIRMATION, SO

123
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
REPUBLICANS CAN'T PHIL BUSTER.

124
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
THE FINAL POINT I'LL MAKE IS

125
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
DEMOCRATS ARE TELLING US THAT

126
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
CHUCK HAGEL THE FORMER

127
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
REPUBLICAN SENATOR IS NOW THE

128
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
LEADING CONTENDER TO BE THE

129
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
NEXT DEFENSE SECRETARY.

130
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
THE RICE MOVE POSSIBLE KERRY

131
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
ELEVATION TO SECRETARY OF
STATE IS PART OF A BROADER

132
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
LOOK AT REFURBISHMENT.

133
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
EXPECTING A NEW NATIONAL

134
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
SECURITY TEAM FOR PRESIDENT TO

135
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
ANNOUNCE AS EARLY AS NEXT

136
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
WEEK.

137
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
>> Eric: THANK YOU, ED
HENRY.

138
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING ELSE, GET

139
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
BACK TO US AND WE'LL GO BACK

140
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
TO YOU.

141
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> Eric: YOU HEAR THIS, AND

142
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I HEARD YOU HUMMING, WHICH

143
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
PART?

144
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
WHAT WAS CONCERNING TO YOU?

145
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
>> Dana: THE PIECE ABOUT THE

146
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
FISCAL CLIFF FIRST.

147
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
YOU THINK THEY HAVE HAD A YEAR

148
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
TO WORK ON THAT THE DEMOCRATS

149
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
AND REPUBLICANS COULD COME

150
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
TOGETHER.
I THINK WHAT HARRY REID HEARD

151
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
LAST NIGHT FROM THE DEMOCRATS

152
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
IS WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO

153
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
ANYTHING.
THIS IS REPORTED IN THE

154
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
NATIONAL JOURNAL TODAY.

155
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO

156
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
MAKE ANY CHANGE OR SACRIFICE

157
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
BENEFIT FOR SOCIAL SECURITY,

158
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
MEDICARE OR MEDICAID.

159
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
THAT WOULD BE A CONDITION OF

160
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER, WHICH IS IF

161
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
WE GIVE YOU THE REVENUE YOU

162
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
HAVE TO HELP US ON THE

163
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
SPENDING SIDE, ON THE

164
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
ENTITLEMENT ISSUE.

165
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
REID SAID I CAN'T GET

166
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
DEMOCRATS TO SUPPORT THAT.

167
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
SO NOW BOEHNER IS GOING UP TO

168
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
SAY ALL RIGHT, WHERE ARE WE?

169
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
MAYBE THEY'LL GET TO

170
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
SOMETHING.

171
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
IF THEY PUSH THIS ON THE NEXT

172
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
YEAR, I THINK IT'S A GOOD

173
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
THING BECAUSE, IN SOME WAYS,

174
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
BECAUSE YOU A NEW CONGRESS AND

175
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
NEW MEMBERS.

176
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
MAYBE BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING

177
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
OUT TO LIVE UNDER THE DECISION

178
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
THAT WOULD BE MADE THIS MONTH,

179
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
MAYBE IT'S OKAY TO HAVE THEM

180
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN ON IT.

181
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
>> Eric: HANG ON TO THE

182
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
AMBASSADOR RICE COMMENT COMMENTA

183
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
MINUTE.
BOB, YOU WERE FIST-PUMPING

184
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
WHILE HEARING HENRY SAY THERE

185
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
IS A MEETING AND THEY MAY KICK

186
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
PART OF IT DOWN THE ROAD.

187
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
>> Eric: WHAT IS HAPPENING

188
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
HERE -- NORTH DAKOTA IS
GETTING TO POINT YOU CAN'T

189
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
WRITE LEGISLATION, NOT ENOUGH

190
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
TIME TO WRITE LEGISLATION

191
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
REVAMPING SOCIAL SECURITY AND

192
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
MEDICARE.

193
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
THEY CAN PASS THE TAX CUTS.

194
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
LEAVE THE TOP 2%, $250,000

195
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
THEIR TAXES WILL GO UP.

196
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
THEY HAVE TO HAVE LANGUAGE

197
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
THERE TO DEAL WITH THE

198
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
REPUBLICAN CONCERN ABOUT

199
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
ENTITLEMENT.
I THINK IT WILL BE ALONG THE

200
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
LINES OF SEQUESTRATION.

201
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN AGREEMENT

202
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
ON SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE

203
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
OR MEDICAID, SOCIAL SECURITY

204
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
OR MEDICARE AT A CERTAIN

205
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
POINT, DATE CERTAIN THERE WILL

206
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
BE AUTOMATIC CUTS IN PROGRAMS.

207
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
>> Andrea: THEY WILL TAKE

208
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
AWAY THE DEFENSE CUTS AND

209
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
PUSH --

210
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
>> Dana: THEY WILL PUSH OFF

211
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
THE DEFENSE CUTS.

212
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
PUSH THEM OFF.

213
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
>> Andrea: HOW HOWARDLY IS

214
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
THAT?

215
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I THINK A LOT OF MEMBERS

216
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
SECRETLY WANTED THE CUTS TO

217
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
TAKE PLACE SO THEY DON'T TAKE

218
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
A STAND AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO

219
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
VOTE EITHER FOR HIGHER TAXES

220
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
OR ON ENTITLEMENTS.

221
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
TODAY IS -- BOB IS RIGHT.

222
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
TODAY IS THE LAST DAY THAT

223
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
THEY NEED TO COME UP WITH A

224
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
DEAL BECAUSE THERE IS A TIME

225
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
CRUNCH ON THE LEGISLATION.

226
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
GETTING IT THROUGH.

227
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
BUT I THINK IT'S DISINGENUOUS

228
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
FOR JAY CARNEY TO COME OUT AND

229
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
SAY TODAY, REPUBLICANS HAVEN'T

230
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
MOVED AT ALL.

231
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
REPUBLICANS HAVE MOVED.

232
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
THEY HAVE COME TO THE TABLE

233
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
WITH REVENUE RAISERS.

234
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
IT'S THE DEMOCRATS THAT

235
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
HAVEN'T MOVED AT ALL.

236
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I DO THINK THAT AFTER THE

237
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
FIRST OF THE YEAR, IT'S NOT

238
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
GOOD TO HAVE THE FIGHT.

239
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
THE REASON FOR THAT IS THEY

240
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
ARE JUST FIGHTING OVER THE TAX

241
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
CUTS FOR THE RICH, THAT IS A

242
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
P.R. BATTLE THAT THE PRESIDENT

243
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
WANTS, BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE

244
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
WILL WIN.

245
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
>> Greg: THIS WAS SUPPOSED

246
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
TO BE ABOUT SPENDING, AND

247
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
TAXES.
NOW IT'S JUST ABOUT TAXES.

248
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
IT'S LIKE IGNORING CANCER AND

249
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
TREATING A COLD SORE.

250
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE ABOUT

251
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
SPENDING.

252
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
THE WORST THING, PRESIDENT

253
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
OBAMA NEVER HAS TO EXPLAIN,

254
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
EVER, WHY RAISING TAXES ON THE

255
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
2% WOULD HELP.

256
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
OR HURT THE ECONOMY.

257
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IT

258
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
WILL HURT THE ECONOMY.

259
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
HE GETS MORE FREE RIDES THAN A

260
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
HOT HITCHHIKER.

261
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
AT SOME POINT, WE HAVE TO

262
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
QUESTION PRESIDENT OBAMA'S

263
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
OBSESSION WITH A CERTAIN

264
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION.

265
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
IF THE RICH WERE JUSTIN

266
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
BIEBER, OBAMA WOULD BE

267
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
ARRESTED FOR STALKING.

268
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
>> Eric: THAT IS ANOTHER

269
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
GREAT LINE.

270
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
>> Bob: ONE THING HE HAS

271
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
GOING FOR HIM IS THE POLLS

272
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
THAT ARE OUT, TWO THINGS IN

273
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
THE POLLS THAT JUST CAME OUT

274
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
FROM PEW AND ABC, "WASHINGTON

275
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
POST," PEOPLE DO WANT SPENDING

276
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
CUTS.
THEY THINK IT'S VERY

277
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
IMPORTANT.

278
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
BUT THEY OVERWHELMINGLY FAVOR

279
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
INCREASE IN TAXES.

280
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
>> IF YOU DON'T OFFER THE

281
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
ALTERNATIVE, YOU KNOW, CLOSING

282
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
THE LOOPHOLES AND FINDING, YOU

283
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
KNOW, GETTING RID OF THE

284
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
BRACKETS, NOBODY EVER PUTS

285
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
THAT IN A POLL.

286
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
WHEN THEY DO PUT IN A POLL

287
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
THAT PEOPLE SHY AWAY FROM

288
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
INCREASING TAXES.

289
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
>> Eric: WE HAVE A COUPLE OF

290
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
POLLS.

291
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
PULL UP THE FIRST ONE.

292
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
HOW THE BUDGET CONTROL, HOW

293
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
THE BUDGET SHOULD BE FIXED.

294
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
49% SAY LAWMAKERS WILL REACH

295
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
AN AGREEMENT.

296
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
34% SAID PUSH THEM OVER THE

297
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
FISCAL CLIFF.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN

298
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
IN THIS HOUR, IN THIS MEETING

299
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
SO WE COULD STILL GO OVER THE

300
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
FISCAL CLIFF.

301
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
THE SECOND POLL, THE BEST WAY

302
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
OR FIX THIS BUDGET PROBLEM,

303
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
57%.
MOSTLY SPENDING CUTS.

304
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
RAISE MY TAXES.

305
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
>> Dana: THIS IS THE PROBLEM

306
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE

307
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
STARTING TO REALIZE, THEY LET

308
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
THIS GO ON TOO LONG.

309
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
YOU NEVER UNDER ESTIMATE THE

310
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TENDENCY

311
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
TO OVERPLAY THEIR HAND.

312
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
YES, THEY HAD A GOOD HAND, BUT

313
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
THEY DO TOO MUCH.

314
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
THEN THE PUBLIC CATCHES UP

315
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
WITH WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.

316
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
THEY SAY WAIT A SECOND, FOR

317
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
SPENDING CUTS AND THE NEW

318
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
STORIES ARE STARTING TO

319
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
CHANGE.
THAT THE DEMOCRATS SAY THEY

320
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
ARE NOT FOR THAT.

321
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
>> Bob: THE PEOPLE BLAME
REPUBLICANS IF IT DOESN'T

322
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
WORK.
THEY BLAME OBAMA.

323
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
IF YOU BROUGHT UP A NUMBER

324
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
SHOULD RICH PEOPLE GET TAX

325
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
INCREASES OVERWHELMINGLY THEY

326
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
YES.
>> Eric: LET'S TALK ABOUT

327
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
WHAT IS GOING ON.

328
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME OUT AND

329
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
SAID I WANT 1.6 TRILLION IN

330
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
NEW REVENUES.

331
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
JOHN BOEHNER SAYS WE WILL GIVE

332
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
YOU $800 EXAMPLE IN NEW

333
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
REVENUE.
OBAMA CAME DOWN TO

334
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
$1.4 TRILLION.

335
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
BOEHNER HASN'T COME BACK YET.

336
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
IF BOEHNER OFFERS $1 TRILLION

337
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
NEW REVENUES CAN IT PASS THE

338
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
HOUSE?
>> Andrea: GREAT QUESTION.

339
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
WE ARE SITTING AROUND THE

340
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
TABLE SITTING ABOUT DEAL THAT

341
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
BOEHNER BROKERS.

342
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
HE HAS TO GO BACK TO THE

343
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
MEMBERS TO GET THE DEAL

344
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
THROUGH THE HOUSE.
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT IT.

345
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I KNOW WHAT HE WON'T GET

346
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
THROUGH THE HOUSE, RAISING

347
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
TAXES.
HE IS NOT GOING TO GET SOME

348
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
TAX RAISING COMPROMISE

349
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
TOGETHER.
THERE IS NO HOUSE MEMBER WHEN

350
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO RUN FOR

351
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
RE-ELECTION EVERY TWO YEARS,

352
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
THAT IS GOING TO VOTE FOR A

353
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
TAX INCREASE.

354
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
HOW WOULD THEY GET THROUGH A

355
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
PRIMARY?

356
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
>> Bob: THEY WILL VOTE ON

357
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
CUTTING TAXES ON EVERYBODY BUT

358
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
THE 2%.

359
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
THAT IS POLITICALLY SELLABLE.

360
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
>> Dana: NO.

361
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
EXTENDING THE BUSH TAX CUTS

362
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
FOR EVERYBODY.
IT'S NOT OBAMA'S TAX CUTS.

363
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
>> Bob: YOU EXTEND IT FOR

364
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
EVERYBODY EXCEPT FOR THAT

365
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
GROUP OF PEOPLE.

366
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
>> Eric: IF THEY ARE NOT --

367
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
LET ME ASK YOU.

368
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
>> Dana: I SEE.

369
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
>> Eric: WILL THEY GET --

370
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
>> Dana: I SEE WHAT HE IS

371
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
SAYING.
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU REDUCE THE

372
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
RATE OF GROWTH, YOU GET CREDIT

373
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
FOR SAYING THAT YOU CUT

374
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
SPENDING.

375
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
IT'S A GAME.

376
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
IT'S A WORD GAME.

377
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
>> Bob: KEEP IN MIND,

378
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
WHATEVER LEGISLATION HAPPENS

379
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
CAN BE RETROACTIVELY MADE TO

380
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
JANUARY 1.
WHEN YOU GET TO JUNE WORKING

381
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
ON THIS, YOU STILL HAVE THE

382
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
DEBT CEILING ISSUE HERE.

383
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
SHE IS RIGHT TOUGH TO GET

384
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
THROUGH THE HOUSE.

385
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
BOEHNER FOR THE FIRST TIME,

386
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
UNLIKE LAST TIME, HE HAS THE

387
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
LIEUTENANTS WITH HIM.
CANADA WITH HIM, TWO OR THREE

388
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
OTHERS IN LEADERSHIP WITH HIM

389
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
ON THIS.

390
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
SO IF HE HAS THAT, HE CAN PUT

391
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
TOGETHER MAJORITY.
>> Eric: CAN YOU IMAGINE

392
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
WHAT IS GOING ON BEHIND THE

393
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
DOOR NOW?
JOHN BOEHNER HAS TO FIGURE OUT

394
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
HOW HE IS GOING TO OFFER

395
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
INCREASE REVENUE, PROBABLY

396
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
OFFER TAX INCREASES AND FIGURE

397
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
OUT HOW TO SELL IT TO THE

398
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
GROUP.
>> Greg: I GO BACK TO THE

399
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
MAXIM ABOUT OBESE PEOPLE.

400
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
THEY ARE NOT FAT BECAUSE THEY

401
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FAT.

402
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THEY'RE FAT BECAUSE THEY EAT

403
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
TOO MUCH.
THAT'S THE GOVERNMENT.

404
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
THE PROBLEM ISN'T THEY NEED

405
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
MORE MONEY.
THEY CAN'T STOP SPENDING.

406
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
EVERY TIME YOU RAISE TAXES

407
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
IT'S INJECTING A FAT PERSON

408
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
WITH TWINKIES.

409
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
>> Eric: WE HAVE TO GO.

410
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF

411
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
BOEHNER WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE

412
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
EITHER TONIGHT OR TOMORROW

413
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
MORNING TO GO BACK TO OHIO.

414
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
AND THIS MEETING HAPPENS.

415
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
>> Dana: THEY ALL WANT A

416
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
WEEKEND.

417
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
THE MEMBERS WANT TO GO BACK

418
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
HOME AND TOUCH BASE WITH THE

419
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
CONSTITUENTS SO OBAMA AND

420
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
BOEHNER WHO ARE ACTING LIKE

421
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
THE ADULTS HERE DECIDED TO

422
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
HAVE A MEETING.

423
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
AND TEMPORARY MEASURES ARE

424
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
VERY BAD FOR THE ECONOMY.

425
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
SO SETTING ASIDE WHAT IS GOOD

426
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
FOR REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS

427
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
IF THEY KICK THIS TO JANUARY

428
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
OR FEBRUARY AND WE TALK ABOUT

429
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
IT THEN, MAYBE IT HELPS THE

430
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
MARKETS GET THROUGH THE FISCAL

431
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
CLIFF AREA.

432
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
BUT STILL A TETCH RARE MEASURE

433
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE --

434
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
>> Greg: CAN WE CALL IT

435
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
SOMETHING ELSE?
FISCAL CLIFF?

436
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
CAN'T WE CALL IT SOMETHING

437
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
ELSE?

438
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
>> Dana: SURE.
>> Eric: MONETARY --

439
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
>> Greg: LIBERAL FANTASY.

440
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
>> Bob: ONE MORE THING ON

441
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
THE TABLE.

442
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
CAN OBAMA SELL CUTS IN

443
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
ENTITLEMENTS TO HIS SENATE?

444
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
>> Dana: NOT ACARDING TO

445
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
HARRY REID.
>> Eric: LEAVE IT THERE.

446
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
WE'LL STAY ON IT.

447
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
DON'T GO AWAY.

448
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000

OF THE YEAR, COVERUP BENGHAZI

464

BIGGEST LIE WAS MILT'S CLAIM

THAT -- MITT'S CLAIM THAT JEEP

469
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
WAS MOVING ITS PRODUCTION TO

NEGATIVE PRESS DIRECTED AT

00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
MITT.
OF COURSE IT DID.

473
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
ONLY THE AMERICAN MEDIA COULD

474
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
SEE THIS LITTLE FLUBB AS WORSE

475
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
THAN THE BUNGLED AFTERMATH

476
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF FOUR

477
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
AMERICANS IN BENGHAZI.

478
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
FORGET THE OTHER LIBERAL LIES

479
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
THAT PAUL RYAN PUSHES GRANNIES

480
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
OFF THE CLIFF, REMEMBER THAT?

481
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
OR MITT MURDERED A GUY'S WIFE.

482
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
THAT WAS FUN.

483
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
MEDIA IS A SAD MIDDLE AGE MAN

484
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
AT STRIP CLUB OVERCOME BY

485
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
OBAMA LUST DIMINISHED BY

486
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
STUPIDITY.
THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOSE

487
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
CLOTHES.
ALL THEY CAN DO IS KEEP

488
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
WHISTLING.

489
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
WHY EVERY NEWS OUTLET RAN WITH

490
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
THE FAKE AWARD.

491
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
THE BLOG CLAIMS THE PUBLIC

492
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
EXPRESSED COLLECTIVE OUTRAGE

493
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
AND THEY MUST MEAN MALE

494
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
BLOGGERS WITH PONYTAILS.

495
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
SAYING THIS IS THE REAL LIE

496
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
BUT IT'S WORSE THAN A LIE.

497
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
ABETTING THE OBAMA COVERUP,

498
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
THE MEDIA IS AN ACCESSORY

499
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
AFTER THE FACT.

500
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS

501
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000

502
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000

DON'T YOU THINK THAT IS WORSE

504
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
THAN A CRACK ABOUT JEEPS

505
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
SHIPPED TO CHINA?

506
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
THE POLITIFACT LIE OF YEAR

507
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
AWARD SHOULD GO TO POLITIFACT.

508
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
CONGRATS.

509
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
COVERING UP "O"'S MISTAKE IS

510
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
YOU CONSIDERED JOURNALISM?

511
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
A FEW MORE DEAD AN YOU'D GET

512
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
THE LIAR'S ACHIEVEMENT AWARD.

513
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
SUSAN RICE REMOVED HER NAME.

514
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD DO

515
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
THAT.

516
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I COULD THEORETICALLY REMOVE

517
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
MY NAME FROM THE STRAWBERRY

518
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000

THE HELLO KITTY AMBASSADORSHIP

523
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
AT TIMES SQUARE.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SEE THEM.

524
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
THEY TRY TO RECRUIT ME.

525
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
>> Andrea: MISS UNIVERSE.

526
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
>> Dana: I UNDERSTAND THEY

527
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
WANT THE NEWS FIGHT AND WHY

528
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
THEY GO AGAINST THE
REPUBLICANS, THE MEAN GUYS.

529
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
HERE IS THE THING.

530
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT BENGHAZI

531
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
SHE WAS NOT LOOKED AT TO BE

532
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
THE NEXT BEST SECRETARY OF

533
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
STATE.

534
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
IT'S A MODERATE SENATOR.

535
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
SENATOR COLLINS SAYING I'M NOT

536
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
FOR THIS.

537
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
SEVERAL REASONS.

538
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA LOST HIS FIRST

539
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
POLITICAL GAMBLE OF A SECOND

540
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
TERM.
THEN THEY ARE MAGNIFYING IT,

541
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
MAKING A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT.

542
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
SHE IS DOING EXCLUSIVE

543
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
INTERVIEW TONIGHT WITH NBC.

544
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
SHE WAS NEVER OFFICIALLY

545
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
NOMINATED FOR ANYTHING.
YOU CAN'T WITHDRAWAL YOUR NAME

546
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
FROM CONSIDERATION.

547
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
WE COULD DO THAT ALL DAY LONG.

548
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
GET MAYBE GOOD PRESS.

549
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000

BE THE SECRETARY OF STATE

553
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
NOMINEE.

554
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
>> Dana: YES, HE --

555
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000

556
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
BUT I NEVER HEARD HIM SAY

557
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
ANYTHING ABOUT SECRETARY OF

558
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
STATE.
>> Andrea: DO YOU WANT TO

THEY WERE TRYING TO GIVE HER

578

THEY FLOATED HER NAME.

NOW, THEY THINK THIS IS GOOD

589
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000

590
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
IT REALLY DO THINK THIS IS

THE PRESIDENT ISSUED A

NOW I LOOK LIKE A VICTIM.

602
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
SHE SHOULD HAVE SAID WEEKS AGO

603
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS

604
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
ON AMERICA'S NEWSROOM, SHE

605
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
SHOULD SAY I DON'T WANT IT.

606
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000

DON'T DO IT BY GIVING HER

TALKING POINTS ON

611
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE AND PUT IT

613
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000

00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
CAN WE PUT THEM IN JAIL?

>> Greg: DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT

622
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
IS?
ONCE THEY FOUND OUT SHE WAS

623
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
WORTH $40 MILLION.
COULD IT HAVE BEEN ATTACK ON

624
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
THE SUPER RICH?

625
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000

THE MONOLOGUE.

632
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
THEY'RE WRONG ON THIS.

633
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
ROMNEY IS RIGHT.

634
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000

648
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
THIS IS A BIGGER DEAL THAN

THE MOST IMPORTANT STATE.

652
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
HE MADE A STATEMENT THAT

653
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
CHRYSLER WAS TAKING THE JEEPS

654
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
AND GOING TO CHINA WITH THEM.

655
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
THAT'S JUST WRONG.

656
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000

THEY SAID THAT WAS A LIE.

694
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000

FOR THEM TO COME OUT AND GIVE

746
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
GIVING ERIC HOLDER ACCESS IS

747
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
GIVING CAR KEYS TO A

748
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
KINDERGARTEN GLASS.

749
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE SHE WILL BE

750
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
THE GROUND GAME IN 2016?

751
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
WE HAVE IMPRISONED A

752
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
FILMMAKER, EXPANDED

753
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
SURVEILLANCE OVER AMERICA AND

754
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
USED DRONES TO KILL AMERICANS.

755
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
WE PAINTED THE RIGHT BEING

756
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
THOSE WHO INFRINGE ON RIGHT.

757
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
BUT EVIL IS DONE IN NAME OF

758
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
AMERICA.

759
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
>> Eric: AL-AWLAKI BECAME A

760
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
U.S. CITIZEN --

761
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
>> I'M OKAY WITH IT.

762
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
HE'S A TERRORIST.

763
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
IT'S BAD UNDER BUSH AND OKAY

764
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
UNDER BAM.

765
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
THE THING I LIST ARE OKAY BUT

766
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
IF IT WAS --

767
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
>> THE TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE

768
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
PROGRAM, BROKE BY THE "NEW

769
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
YORK TIMES."
PROGRAM IN PLACE TO SURVEIL

770
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
ANYONE TALKING TO A TERRORIST

771
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
OVERSEAS.
THIS WAS THE BIGGEST DEAL

772
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
GOING.

773
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
EVERYBODY FREAKED OUT.

774
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
RUINED A WAY TO COLLECTER

775
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
THOR.

776
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
BUT IN ADDITION PROGRAM

777
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
ANALYSIS, THEY ADMIT THEY HAVE

778
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
TO SO MUCH INFORMATION THEY

779
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

780
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
>> A BIG DIFFERENCE HERE.

781
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
PEOPLE ON THE LEFT, WHAT ABOUT

782
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
THE PATRIOT ACT.

783
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
SIMILAR TYPE OF THINGS.

784
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
PAYRY YOT ACT WENT THROUGH

785
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
CONGRESS AND VOTED ON.

786
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
THEY WANT TO PULL IT, THEY CAN

787
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
PULL THE PLUG ON IT.

788
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
THIS IS EXECUTIVE ORDER.

789
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
IT HAPPENED BEHIND CLOSED

790
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
DOORS.
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" DID

791
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
A REQUEST BUT THIS VIOLATES

792
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
THE FOURTH AMENDMENT.

793
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
THEY CAN GO IN AND TAKE WHAT

794
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
THEY WANT WITHOUT THE PROBABLE

795
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
CAUSE.

796
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
THEY DON'T TO PROVE PROBABLE

797
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
CAUSE.

798
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
THIS IS DISTURBING.

799
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
>> THIS IS AND OUGHT TO BE

800
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
DONE AWAY WITH.

801
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
THE REASON YOU SIGN THE

802
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
EXECUTIVE ORDER IS BECAUSE OF

803
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
THE PATRIOT ACT.

804
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
IT GIVES THE PRESIDENT THE

805
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
AUTHORITY IN ADMINISTRATION --

806
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
>> THAT IS --

807
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
>> EXECUTIVE ORDER ON THIS

808
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
PART.

809
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
YOU COULDN'T BEFORE THE

810
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
PATRIOT ACT YOU COULDN'T SIGN

811
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
A THING.
BUT WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT,

812
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
REMEMBER THE PHONE COMPANIES

813
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
GOT IN THAT IS ALL OF THAT

814
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
TROUBLE, THEY HELPED OUT THE

815
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
ADMINISTRATION IN
COUNTERTERRORISM AND PULLED

816
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
THE PLUG ON THAT.

817
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
TERRIBLE.

818
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
>> Andrea: THE PATRIOT ACT

819
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
WAS DESIGNED TO FOCUS ON

820
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
TERRORISM.

821
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION USED

822
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
IT TO GET TERRORISM

823
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
INFORMATION NON-TERRORISM DATA

824
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
BASES.
THIS IS TO GET ANY INFORMATION

825
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
ANYWHERE.
NOT JUST THE FOURTH AMENDMENT.

826
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
FRONT TO THE BILL OF RIGHTS.

827
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
YOU KNOW, THOUGH, THE LEFT HAS

828
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
BEEN SESELECTIVELY BERSERK

829
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
ABOUT PRIVACY.

830
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET

831
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
HANDS ON THE MEDICAL RECORDS

832
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
FOR YEARS.

833
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
THEY ARE DOING IT UNDER

834
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
OBAMACARE.
AS YOU POINT OUT, AS LONG AS

835
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
IT'S FOR THE GREATER GOOD,

836
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
PRIVACY DOESN'T MATTER.

837
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY

838
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
WANT.

839
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I HOPE IT HEADS TO THE COURTS.

840
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE THEY

841
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
FOCUS ON TERRORISM.

842
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
>> THE ADMINISTRATION, THEY
SAY THEY ONLY LOOK AT LIKELY

843
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
TERRORISM THINGS.

844
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED.

845
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THE OTHER

846
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
CITIES, SOME OF THE PUBLIC BUS

847
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
SYSTEMS PUT MICROPHONE IN THE

848
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
SEAT TO DO SURVEILLANCE.

849
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
IMAGINE IF YOU HEARD THIS

850
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
CONVERSATION.

851
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
THERE IS GREG, BOB, ERIC,

852
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
IMAGINE YOU WERE ON A PUBLIC

853
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
BUS AND HEAR WHAT THEY WERE

854
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
TALKING ABOUT.

855
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
>> THAT IS FUNNY.

856
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
>> Greg: I HAVE NEVER BEEN

857
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
ON A PUBLIC BUS.

858
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
THE ONLY TALK YOU HEAR ON A

859
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
BUS IS A GUY HAVING A

860
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
CONVERSATION WITH HIMSELF.

861
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
HE'S NORMALLY NOT WEARING

862
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
PANTS.

863
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT BILL HEMMER.

864
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
>> Andrea: BILL DOESN'T RIDE

865
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
THE BUS.
>> Bob: I TALK TO A NUMBER

866
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
OF LIBERAL SINCE THE STORY

867
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
BROKE.

868
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
THEY ARE ALL FURIOUS ABOUT IT.

869
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
THIS IS NOT THE LIBERALS

870
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
BEHIND THIS.

871
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
THEY ARE OUTRAGED.

872
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
>> Dana: THE WAY THEY DEAL

873
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000

874
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
MAKING THEY PUT THEM UP ON A

WEBSITE.

876
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
AS IF IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY

877
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
TO GO TO THE WEBSITE AND CHECK

878
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000

WHERE IS THE PRESS?

879
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
SIX MONTHS LATER SHE WROTE

880
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000

881
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000

882
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
WHERE ARE THE --

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'M FINE WITH PUTTING

885
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
SURVEILLANCE ON BUSES.

886
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
>> Greg: WHAT?

887
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
>> Eric: LISTEN, I'M ALL FOR

888
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
PUTTING SURVEILLANCE ON THE

891
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
KNOW WHAT OUT OF EACH OTHER.

>> Andrea: YOUR POINT IS THE

893
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
LIBERALS ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF

894
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
WHAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

895
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
IS DOING.

896
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I HAVEN'T HEARD THE OUTRAGE

897
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000

SAME LEVEL OF OUTRAGE

900
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
OBVIOUSLY BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE

901
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
OUTRAGED BY IT.

902
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
LEVIN IN THE SENATE WILL MAKE

903
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
A STINK ABOUT IT.

904

905
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
OUTRAGED IT MUST BE A WHISPER.

906

907
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
IS THE PUBLIC BUS.

1313
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
CONGRESS HAS DONE SOMETHING

1314
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
POSITIVE WITH THEIR TIME.

1315
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000

DECIDED INSTEAD OF DOING THAT

1367
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000

1386
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
