00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
FIRST OF ALL, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

215
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
>> I'M OKAY.
FAMILY IS HERE, THAT HELPS.

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
IT WAS AWFUL.

220
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
>> YOU WERE IN YOUR CLASSROOM.

221
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
>> I WAS IN MY CLASSROOM.

222
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
>> YOU WERE IN YOUR CLASSROOM.

223
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

224
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, ABOUT 9:30,

225
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
9:40, WE HEARD NOISES AND THE

226
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM WAS STILL
ON, SO IT DIDN'T GO OFF, SO YOU

227
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
COULD HEAR WHAT SOUNDED LIKE

228
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
POPS, GUNSHOTS, OF COURSE, I'M

229
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
NOT GOING TO TELL THAT TO 5 YEAR

230
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
OLDS, AND I SAID WE'RE GOING

231
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
OVER IN A SAFE AREA AND WE'RE

232
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
GOING TO -- WE READ A STORY AND

233
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
KEPT THEM CALM.

234
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
DID A LOCKDOWN DRILL.

235
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
CLOSED THE DOOR, LOCKED, COVERED

236
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000

237
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
AND, YOU KNOW, KEPT THE CHILDREN

238
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000

239
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I HAVE OTHER ADULTS --

240
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
>> I FIND THAT AMAZING -- I FIND

241
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
THAT AMAZING THAT FEARING THAT

242
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
YOU HEAR GUNSHOTS, YOU WERE ABLE

243
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
TO HAVE THE COMPOSURE TO SIT

244
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
DOWN AND READ TO YOUR STUDENTS.

245
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

246
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
WITH 5-YEAR-OLDS, YOU CAN'T LOSE

247
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
IT.

248
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
SO, YOU KNOW, YOU JUST KIND

249
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
OF -- I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A

250
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
LONG TIME.

251
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
IT'S MY 18th YEAR OF TEACHING,

252
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
AND MY JOB WAS TO KEEP THEM

253
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
SAFE.
I DIDN'T KNOW -- NO ANNOUNCEMENT

254
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.

255
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
YOU KNOW, MY I STINGT WAS IT

256
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
WASN'T GOOD.

257
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
SO WE KEPT THEM CALM, STAYED IN

258
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
THE ROOM UNTIL THERE WAS BANGING

259
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
AT THE DOOR, WHICH WAS POLICE,

260
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
TROOPERS, WHOEVER WAS THERE, AND

261
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
THEY HAD US EXIT THE BUILDING

262
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
AND TOLD THE CHILDREN TO COVER

263
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
THEIR EYES AND WALK IN A LINE

264
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
AND LEAVE THE BUILDING AND

265
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
THAT'S WHEN WE WENT DOWN TOWARD

266
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
THE FIREHOUSE.

267
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
SO, YOU KNOW, WE WERE ALL SAFE.

268
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I HAD 19 CHILDREN IN THE ROOM

269
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
WITH ME, AND THANK GOODNESS,

270
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
THEIR PARENTS WERE ABLE TO COME,

271
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
PICK THEM UP, TAKE THEM HOME.

272
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
>> WHEN YOU WERE READING, DID

273
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
THE KIDS REALIZE SOMETHING WAS

274
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
GOING ON, OR THINK IT WAS A

275
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
DRILL LIKE BEFORE?

276
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
>> RIGHT, IT DIDN'T SEEM A

277
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
NATURAL THING, ALTHOUGH WE DO

278
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
PRACTICE DRILLS, AND WE JUST

279
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
SAID, WELL, WE'RE NOT REALLY

280
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
SURE, BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE

281
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
SAFE, BECAUSE WE'RE SITTING OVER

282
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
HERE AND WE'RE ALL TOGETHER.

283
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
AND THAT'S, YOU KNOW, AS WE GOT

284
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
DOWN TO THE FIREHOUSE, LATER ON,

285
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
THERE WAS A LOT OF THE EVENTS

286
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
STARTED TO UNFOLD THROUGHOUT THE

287
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
DAY, I THINK SOME OF THEM

288
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
REALIZED THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT

289
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
WAS GOING ON, SAW OTHER PEOPLE

290
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
UPSET, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE JUST

291
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
HELD THEM CLOSE UNTIL THEIR

292
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
PARENTS CAME AND WE RELEASED

293
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
THEM, AND, YOU KNOW, MY ROOM, MY

294
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
CHILDREN, WERE ALL ACCOUNTED

295
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
FOR, AND SAFE IN MY KINDERGARTEN

296
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
CLASSROOM.

297
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
>> FOR ALL OF US,

298
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
INCOMPREHENSIBLE, YOU KNEW THE

299
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
CHILDREN, THE FAMILIES INVOLVED.

300
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE LOST THEIR

301
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
LIVES.
I CERTAINLY WON'T ASK YOU ABOUT

302
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
ANY OF THE KIDS.
WHAT DO YOU WANT THE WORLD TO

303
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
KNOW ABOUT YOUR COLLEAGUES?

304
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
>> YEAH, I MEAN, WE HEARD A LOT

305
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
OF THINGS AS WE WERE DOWN AT THE

306
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
FIREHOUSE.

307
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WERE TEXTING

308
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
NEWS REPORTS AND THIS ONE, THAT

309
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
ONE, I'M SURE -- I'M NOT SURE

310
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
STILL OF THE MAGNITUDE OF WHO

311
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
EVERYONE IS, I HEAR SIX OR SEVEN

312
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
ADULTS AND MANY CHILDREN, AND,

313
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
YOU KNOW, I KNOW THOSE FIRST

314
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
GRADERS WERE CHILDREN I HAD IN

315
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
MY ROOM LAST YEAR.

316
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
SO THOSE PARENTS WERE SHOWING UP

317
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
TODAY, AND THEY COULDN'T FIND

318
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
THEIR CHILDREN, AND, YOU KNOW,

319
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
THEY WERE ALL TAKEN TO SEPARATE

320
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
ROOMS AND SO -- I DON'T KNOW WHO

321
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
THEY ALL ARE, BUT I'M SURE AS

322
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
THE DAYS UNFOLD, IT WILL NOT

323
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
BE -- IT WILL NOT BE GOOD NEWS

324
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
FOR MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE.

325
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
>> AND -- YEAH, IT'S REALLY

326
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
BEYOND WORDS, AND I APPRECIATE

327
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
YOU TAKING A FEW MOMENTS TO TALK

328
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
TO US TONIGHT.

329
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
IT REALLY IS --

330
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
>> WELL --

331
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
>> JANET, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

332
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
COMPOSURE.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

333
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
>> IT'S EXTRAORDINARY WHAT YOU

334
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
DID, AND THE OTHER COLLEAGUES OF

335
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
YOURS.
>> SOME OF THOSE TEACHERS WERE

336
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
HEROES.
ONE OF THE TEACHERS, SHE LOCKED

337
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
EVERYBODY IN THE BATHROOM.

338
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
AND WOULDN'T OPEN THE DOOR.

339
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
YOU KNOW, I THINK WE DO THIS AS

340
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
TEACHERS, WE ARE TRAINED, WE DO

341
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
HAVE DRILLS, WE TALK TO THE

342
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
KIDS, AND IN CASE SOMETHING WERE

343
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
TO HAPPEN, THIS IS WHAT WE DO.

344
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
AND IT'S KIND OF WHAT HAPPENED

345
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
TODAY.

346
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
EVERYBODY JUST IN STINCTIVELY

347
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
KEPT THE CHILDREN SAFE.
>> A LOT OF TEACHERS I THINK OF

348
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
HEROES, AND YOU AND YOUR

349
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
COLLEAGUES SHOWED THAT TODAY.

350
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
>> THANK YOU.

351
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
>> I WISH YOU PEACE AND STRENGTH

352
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
IN THE DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD.

353
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
AMY RECEISEIVER IS JOINING US.

354
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
SHE IS A PARENT.

355
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
HOW IS YOUR DAUGHTER DOING, YOUR

356
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
FAMILY, HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

357
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
>> OKAY.
IT'S A VERY ROUGH NIGHT HERE.

358
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
WHEN YOUR FIRST GRADER GOES TO

359
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
BED AND SAYS, MOMMY, IS ANYONE

360
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
FROM MY CLASS LAST YEAR, ARE

361
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
THEY ALL OKAY?

362
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
ARE THEY ALL OKAY?

363
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
AND YOU LOOK AT THEM AND SAY I'M

364
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
NOT REALLY SURE, IT'S NOT THE

365
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
BEST NIGHT WHEN YOU TELL THAT TO

366
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
YOUR 7-YEAR-OLD.

367
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
IT'S -- VERY, VERY SAD NIGHT FOR

368
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
THIS TOWN AND A LOT OF FAMILIES

369
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
HERE.

370
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
>> HAS YOUR DAUGHTER WANTED TO

371
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OR

372
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
FIRST GRADE, I DON'T -- DO THEY

373
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
WANT TO TALK?

374
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
>> SHE ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS

375
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL.

376
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
SHE CAUGHT WIND VERY QUICK THAT

377
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
WILL SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH

378
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
OUR PRINCIPAL.

379
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
WHICH WE DIDN'T TELL HER UNTIL

380
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
JUST NOW THAT, YES, SHE WAS

381
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
DEFINITELY HURT AND IT WASN'T

382
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
GOOD.
IT TOOK HER -- IT'S TAKING HER A

383
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
WHILE.

384
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I THINK TOMORROW WILL PROBABLY

385
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
BE HARDER FOR HER.

386
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I ALSO HAVE A FIFTH GRADER WHO

387
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
CAME OFF THE BUS CRYING, BECAUSE

388
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
SHE, ONE, HAD A SISTER WHO SHE

389
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
WAS WORRIED ABOUT, AND JUST

390
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
BASICALLY LEFT THAT SCHOOL, A

391
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
FEW MONTHS AGO AND I THINK FOR A

392
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
LOT OF THOSE KIDS, THEY KIND OF

393
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
ARE A LITTLE OLDER AND CAN GET

394
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
IT A LITTLE BIT FASTER, EVEN

395
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
THOUGH THEY WEREN'T IN IT.

396
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
SO IT'S -- THE QUESTIONS I THINK

397
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
ARE COMING.

398
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
THEY ARE NOT REALLY HERE YET,

399
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
ESPECIALLY FOR THE LITTLER ONES,

400
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
BUT IT'S STARTED AS I PUT THEM

401
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
TO BED TONIGHT, THE QUESTIONS.

402
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
>> DO YOU KNOW -- AS A MOM, DO

403
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
YOU KNOW HOW YOU ARE GOING TO

404
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS?
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF

405
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
PARENTS AROUND THE WORLD,

406
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
FRANKLY, WHOSE KIDS ARE GOING TO

407
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
BE ASKING THEM QUESTIONS IN THE

408
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
DAYS AHEAD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

409
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT YOU

410
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
ARE GOING TO SAY?

411
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
>> UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE BEEN

412
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
THROUGH A BIT OF TRAUMA IN OUR

413
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
OWN LIFE, FOR ME, AND I CAN'T

414
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
SPEAK FOR MOMS -- OTHER MOMS OR

415
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
MOMS AROUND THE WORLD, BUT FOR

416
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
MY FAMILY, I SPEAK KIND OF

417
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
QUIETLY AND TRUSTFTHFULLY AND T

418
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT

419
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
THEY ASK WITHOUT A LOT OF

420
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
DETAIL.
I DEFINITELY DON'T LIE.

421
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
IS PRINCE HOCHSPRUNG OKAY?

422
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
AND I SAID NO.

423
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
AND SHE SAID IS SHE DEAD?

424
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
AND I SAID YES.

425
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I TRY NOT TO OFFER TOO MUCH.

426
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY KNOW.

427
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR THEM TO

428
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
ASK.
IF THEY ASK, I GIVE THEM AN

429
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
HONEST ANSWER.

430
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
AND, UNFORTUNATELY, FOR A LOT OF

431
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
US IN TOWN, THE ANSWERS ARE NOT

432
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
GOOD.
>> THE PRINCIPAL, DAWN --

433
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
>> AND THEY ARE VERY SAD

434
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
TONIGHT, I DON'T THINK ANYONE

435
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
CAN ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS

436
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
EASILY -- THEY ARE DEFINITELY

437
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
NOT FUN ANSWERS.

438
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
>> I'VE HEARD SO MANY GREAT

439
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
THINGS ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL, DAWN

440
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
HOCHSPRUNG, AND THE FACT THAT

441
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
YOUR CHILD WAS ASKING ABOUT HER.

442
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW

443
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
ABOUT DAWN?

444
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
>> A VERY LOVELY COMPASSIONATE

445
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
WOMAN.

446
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
EXTREMELY HELPFUL.

447
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
AS A CHAIR ON ONE OF THE PTA

448
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
COMMITTEES, COULD NOT HAVE COME

449
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
OUT TO SUPPORT ME BETTER THIS

450
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
YEAR.
I NEEDED SUPPORT THIS YEAR, AND

451
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE ON MY

452
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
TEAM, THE FIRST ONE TO HELP, THE

453
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
FIRST ONE TO BE THERE.

454
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
NEVER SAW HER WITHOUT A SMILE.

455
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
YOU KNOW, WAS JUST IN MY

456
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
DAUGHTER'S CLASSROOM THIS WEEK,

457
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
READING A BOOK TO THE KIDS.

458
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
VERY, VERY LOVELY, VERY LOVELY

459
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
WOMAN.
AND DEFINITELY HAD THE CHILDREN

460
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I BELIEVE HAD THE CHILDREN'S

461
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
BEST INTENTIONS ALL THE TIME.

462
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
SHE WAS ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR

463
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
THEM.

464
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
JUST A VERY SAD THING.

465
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
>> YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED, AND

466
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'M GOING TO LET YOU GO.

467
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I APPRECIATE YOU TALKING

468
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
TONIGHT, AND THANK YOU.

469
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I REALLY -- I JUST WISH YOU AND

470
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
YOUR FAMILY A LOT OF STRENGTH.

471
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
THANK YOU.
>> MY FAMILY IS ONE OF THE LUCKY

472
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
ONES, ANDERSON.

473
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE A LOT

474
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
OF PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, THAT AREN'T

475
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
SO LUCKY TONIGHT IN TOWN, BUT

476
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
THANK YOU, AND I -- WE PRAY FOR

477
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
ALL OF THE FAMILIES THAT ARE OUT

478
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
THERE TONIGHT.

479
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
>> YEAH.
I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF

480
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
PRAYERS AROUND THE WORLD TONIGHT

481
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
FOR THE FAMILIES, AMY, THANK

482
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
YOU.
>> THANK YOU.

483
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
>> IT IS FRANKLY UNBELIEVABLE.

484
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
LET'S GO BACK TO SOLEDAD.

485
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
>> IT REALLY IS.

486
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
IT REALLY IS.

487
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
AND IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE I

488
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
THINK TO FATHOM WHAT THE PEOPLE

489
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
OF NEWTOWN ARE GOING THROUGH NOW

490
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
AND WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE

491
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
GOING THROUGH IN THE NEXT DAYS

492
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
AND WEEKS, ESPECIALLY THE

493
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
PARENTS AND SIBLINGS AND FAMILY

494
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
MEMBERS OF LITTLE CHILDREN WHO

495
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
DID NOT SURVIVE THE MASSACRE

496
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
TODAY.

497
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
SO MANY LIVES WERE LOST, SO MANY

498
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES WERE JUST

499
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
CHANGED FOREVER.
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND IN

500
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
SOME CASES COMPLETE STRANGERS

501
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
GATHERED AND CONTINUE TO GATHER

502
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
AT THIS HOUR, HOLD EACH OTHER,

503
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
CRY, AND TO REMEMBER.

504
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
A VIGIL TONIGHT, TOOK PLACE AT A

505
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
LOCAL CHURCH AND JASON CARROLL

506
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
HAS BEEN THERE ALL DAY AND

507
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
THROUGH THE NIGHT AND AN UPDATE

508
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
ON HOW THAT WENT TONIGHT.

509
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
JASON, THE MOOD HAS GOT TO BE SO

510
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
SAD.

511
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

512
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
TONIGHT'S VIGIL.

513
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
>> YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN A LOT OF

514
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
EMOTIONAL THINGS THROUGHOUT MY

515
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
LIFE, BUT TONIGHT WAS -- IT'S

516
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
REALLY HARD TO EXPLAIN.

517
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
THE VIGIL HERE TONIGHT.

518
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
SO MANY PEOPLE CAME OUT,

519
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
SOLEDAD.
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH ROOM FOR

520
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
EVERYBODY INSIDE ST. ROSA LINEA

521
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
CHURCH.

522
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
THEY CAME OUTSIDE.

523
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
STOOD IN THE FREEZING COLD.

524
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE STOOD INSIDE
AND LISTENED.

525
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
WHEN THE VIGIL THAT LET OUT, ALL

526
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
OF THOSE STANDING OUTSIDE WENT

527
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
INSIDE AND YOU HEARD SOME

528
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
SINGING AT ONE POINT.

529
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
GROUPS BROKE OFF INTO SEPARATE

530
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
GROUPS AND STARTED SINGING.

531
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
PEOPLE REALLY CAME HERE TONIGHT,

532
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
AND I KNOW YOU JUST HEARD

533
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
ANDERSON GIVE THAT VERY

534
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
EMOTIONAL INTERVIEW.

535
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
PEOPLE CAME HERE LOOKING FOR

536
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
ANSWERS, JUST LIKE THAT MOTHER

537
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
WAS TRYING TO GIVE ANSWERS TO

538
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
HER DAUGHTER.

539
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
AND IT'S DIFFICULT, IT'S VERY

540
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
TOUGH TO TRY AND GET THOSE

541
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
ANSWERS AT THIS TIME.

542
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
PEOPLE CAME LOOKING FOR THAT.

543
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
THEY CAME TO LEAN ON EACH OTHER

544
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
AND THEY TURNED TO THEIR FAITH.

545
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
THIS IS SUCH A SMALL COMMUNITY

546
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
THAT IT'S THE KIND OF PLACE

547
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
WHERE LITERALLY SO MANY OF THE

548
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
PEOPLE CAME OUT TONIGHT KNEW

549
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
SOMEONE.
KNEW ONE OF THE FACULTY MEMBERS,

550
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
KNEW ONE OF THE CHILDREN.

551
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
THEY TALKED ABOUT ONE THE LITTLE

552
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
GIRLS WHO LOST HER LIFE WHO WAS

553
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
SUPPOSED TO BE IN A CHRISTMAS

554
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
PAGEANT HERE AT THE CHURCH.

555
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
SPOKE TO ANOTHER MAN WHO KNEW

556
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
THE PRINCIPAL.
HE WANTED TO SPEAK OUT BEFORE HE

557
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
WENT INTO THE VIGIL AND I WANT

558
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
YOU TO LISTEN TO A LITTLE BIT OF

559
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
THAT CONVERSATION.
>> DAWN, THE PRINCIPAL AT SANDY

560
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
HOOK, I HAD DINNER WITH HER LAST

561
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
SPRING, SHE WAS EXCITED,

562
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
EXUBERANT, AN EXCEPTIONAL

563
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
EDUCATOR.

564
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
IT'S SAD.

565
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
BUT MY PRAYERS WILL BE FOR OUR

566
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
COMMUNITY AS WELL.

567
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
>> ONE OF THE OTHER POINTS THAT

568
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
HE WANTED TO MAKE WAS THAT THIS

569
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
WAS A WOMAN WHO LOVED NOT ONLY

570
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
HER SCHOOL AND HER JOB, BUT SHE

571
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
LOVED ALL OF THE CHILDREN AT THE

572
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
SCHOOL AS WELL.

573
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
SOLEDAD.
>> SO, JASON, I KNOW YOU HAD A

574
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
CHANCE TO TALK TO THE DEACON,

575
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
AND I'M SURE HE WILL BE A FOCUS

576
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
OF MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

577
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
PEOPLE ARE HAVING.

578
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

579
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
>> IT'S -- IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR

580
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
HIM.

581
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
HE BECAME EMOTIONAL DURING OUR

582
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
CONVERSATION.
HE SAID THAT AT LEAST 100 PEOPLE

583
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
HAD COME TO THE CHURCH DOORS

584
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY LOOKING FOR

585
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
ANSWERS.
AND I SAID HOW DO YOU TRY AND

586
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
PROVIDE ANSWERS?

587
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
HE SAID IT'S TOO SOON TO COME UP

588
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
WITH SOME SORT OF A DEEP

589
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
PHILOSOPHICAL ANSWER AS TO WHY

590
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
THIS HAPPENED.

591
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
HE WAS ALSO FEELING THE EMOTION

592
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED AS WELL.

593
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
HE KNEW SOME OF THE CHILDREN

594
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
THAT WERE KILLED, INCLUDING SOME

595
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
OF THE FACULTY MEMBERS.

596
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
HE SPOKE ABOUT ONE CHILD IN

597
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
PARTICULAR, WHO HE REMEMBERED

598
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
RECEIVING HER FIRST COMMUNE HERE

599
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
AT THE CHURCH, AND A CHILD WHO

600
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
REALLY LEFT AN IMPRESSION UPON

601
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
HIM, AND HE EXPLAINS THE REASON

602
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
WHY.

603
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
>> I HEARD ONE OF THE VICTIMS,

604
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT IT, BUT I

605
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
HEARD ONE OF THE VICTIMS

606
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
RECENTLY, I THINK IT WAS

607
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
BIRTHDAY MONEY, HER BIRTHDAY

608
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
GIFTS AND DONATED IT TO THE

609
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
PARISH TO GIVE FOR HURRICANE

610
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
SANDY VICTIMS.

611
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
SHE'S 6 YEARS OLD.

612
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
SO THAT'S -- THAT MAKES IT VERY,

613
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
VERY PERSONAL.

614
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
AND VERY INTIMATE.

615
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
>> HIS STRUGGLE IS THAT HE HAS

616
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
GOT TO BE A ROCK FOR THE

617
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
COMMUNITY NOW.
HE HAS GOT TO TRY TO KEEP IT

618
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
TOGETHER AS MORE PEOPLE COME TO

619
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
HIM TO LEAN ON HIM FOR EMOTIONAL

620
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
SUPPORT.
I ASKED HIM, I SAID WHAT DO YOU

621
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
DO?
I'M GOING TO GO HOME, HUG MY OWN

622
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
DAUGHTER, AND I'M GOING TO COME

623
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
BACK HERE AND BE THE SUPPORT

624
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
THIS COMMUNITY NEEDS.

625
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
SOLEDAD.

626
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
>> JASON CARROLL FOR US, THANK

627
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
YOU, JASON.

628
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
APPRECIATE THAT.

629
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
AND, ANDERSON, IT'S A QUESTION

630
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET AN

631
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
ANSWER TO.
THE WHY BEHIND IT.

632
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

633
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
THE SHOOTER, BUT THE MOTIVATION

634
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
IS ALWAYS THE THING I DON'T

635
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
THINK ANYBODY IS CLOSE TO

636
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
UNDERSTANDING AT THIS POINT.

637
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
>> YEAH, AND MAY NEVER.

638
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES

639
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
THERE ISN'T ANY WHY.

640
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
BUT WE'LL CONTINUE TO

641
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
INVESTIGATE, SOLEDAD, WE'LL COME

642
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
BACK TO YOU SHORTLY.

643
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT YET

644
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
RELEASED THE NAME OF THE

645
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
VICTIMS, THE PROCESS OF

646
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
IDENTIFICATION CONTINUES AT THIS

647
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
HOUR.

648
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
THOSE CHILDREN'S LITTLE BODIES

649
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
ARE STILL INSIDE THAT SCHOOL AND

650
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
IT'S APPROPRIATE, WE'LL FOCUS ON

653
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
THE LIVES.

654
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THEM WHEN

655
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
WE LEARN ABOUT THEM, WHAT

656
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
PARENTS WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM.

657
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
THE VICTIMS WE WANT HISTORY TO

658
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
REMEMBER AND HONOR.

659
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah, you can watch it on your
sleigh!

735
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
OK!

736
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Here you go.

737
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Aw, thanks elves.

738
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I also made you a video.

739
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You are so sweet.

740
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But you probably shouldn't watch
it on the sleigh.

741
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Say goodbye to Santa boys!

742
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Bye!

743
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Good bye Santa!

744
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Bye!

745
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Exclusively at AT&T, buy any
Samsung Galaxy smartphone,

746
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
get up to $100 off a second
msung Galaxy device.

747
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
>>> IT DOESN'T EVEN SEEM REAL.

748
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
IT JUST DOES NOT EVEN SEEM LIKE

749
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
IT'S POSSIBLE.

750
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
YOU READ IT IN THE PAPER, SEE IT

751
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
ON THE NEWS, YOU'RE LIKE OH, MY

752
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
GOD, THAT POOR FAMILY.

753
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
AND SOMETHING HAPPENS SO CLOSE

754
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
TO HOME, IT'S LIKE I THINK I'M

755
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
STILL IN SHOCK, TO BE HONEST

756
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
WITH YOU.

757
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
>> WELL, NO DOUBT A LOT OF

758
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
PEOPLE FEELING THE IMPACT SAME

759
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
WAY TONIGHT.

760
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
THE MASSACRE INSIDE THE SCHOOL,

761
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
THE DEADLIEST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

762
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
SHOOTING IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

763
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
ALL THE WORDS SPOKEN TODAY, AND

764
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
ALL OF THE WORDS I'M SPEAKING

765
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
TONIGHT IN THIS HOUR, THEY ALL

766
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
SOUND SO SMALL IN THE FACE OF

767
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
THIS HORROR.

768
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
20 LITTLE CHILDREN, 7 ADULTS.

769
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
LAST NIGHT ALIVE, GETTING READY

770
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
FOR ANOTHER DAY OF SCHOOL,

771
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
TONIGHT THEY ARE GONE.

772
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE TO THE

773
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
NATION EARLIER, WE PLAYED SOME

774
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
OF IT BEFORE THE TOP OF THE

775
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
PROGRAM.
BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH HEARING

776
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
ALL OF WHAT HE SAID.

777
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
>> THIS AFTERNOON I SPOKE WITH

778
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
GOVERNOR MALLOY, FBI DIRECTOR

779
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
MUELLER.

780
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I OFFERED GOVERNOR MALLOY MY

781
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
CONDOLENCES ON BEHALF OF THE

782
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
NATION AND MADE IT CLEAR HE WILL

783
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
HAVE EVERY SINGLE RESOURCE HE

784
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THIS

785
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
HEINOUS CRIME, CARE FOR THE

786
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
VICTIMS, COUNCIL THEIR FAMILIES.

787
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
WE HAVE ENDURED TOO MANY OF

788
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
THESE TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST FEW

789
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
YEARS, AND EACH TIME I LEARN THE

790
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
NEWS, I REACT NOT AS A

791
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
PRESIDENT, BUT AS ANYBODY ELSE

792
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
WOULD, AS A PARENT, AND THAT WAS

793
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
ESPECIALLY TRUE TODAY.

794
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I KNOW THAT THERE IS NOT A

795
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
PARENT IN AMERICA WHO DOESN'T

796
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
FEEL THE SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF

797
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
THAT I DO.

798
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

799
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

800
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

801
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

802
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

803
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
AHEAD OF THEM, BIRTHDAYS,

804
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
GRADUATIONS, WEDDINGS, KIDS OF

805
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
THEIR OWN.

806
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

807
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
TEACHERS, MEN AND WOMEN WHO

808
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING

809
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
OUR CHILDREN FULFILL THEIR

810
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
DREAMS, SO OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN

811
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
TODAY FOR THE PARENTS AND

812
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
GRANDPARENTS, SISTERS AND

813
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE

814
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
CHILDREN, AND FOR THE FAMILIES

815
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
OF THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST.

816
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

817
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
PARENTS OF THE SURVIVORS AS

818
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
WELL.
FOR AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE TO

819
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

820
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
TONIGHT, THEY KNOW THAT THEIR

821
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN

822
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY,

823
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
AND NO WORDS WILL EASE THEIR

824
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
PAIN.
AS A COUNTRY, WE HAVE BEEN

825
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
THROUGH THIS TOO MANY TIMES.

826
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
WHETHER IT'S AN ELEMENTARY

827
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN OR A SHOPPING

828
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
MALL IN OREGON OR A TEMPLE IN

829
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
WISCONSIN, OR A MOVIE THEATER IN

830
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
AURORA OR A STREET CORNER IN

831
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
CHICAGO, THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE

832
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THESE

833
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
CHILDREN ARE OUR CHILDREN.

834
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME

835
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
TOGETHER AND TAKE MEANINGFUL

836
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
ACTION TO PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES

837
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
LIKE THIS, REGARDLESS OF THE

838
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
POLITICS.

839
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
THIS EVENING, MICHELLE AND I

840
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
WILL DO WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT

841
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
IN AMERICA WILL DO.

842
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
WHICH IS HOLD OUR CHILDREN A

843
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
LITTLE TIGHTER, TELL THEM WE

844
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
LOVE THEM AND REMIND EACH OTHER

845
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
HOW DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

846
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

847
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CANNOT DO THAT

848
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
TONIGHT, AND THEY NEED ALL OF US

849
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
RIGHT NOW IN OUR DAYS TO COME,

850
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
THE COMMUNITY NEEDS TO US BE AT

OUR BEST AS AMERICANS, AND I

852
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER

853
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
AS PRESIDENT TO HELP, BECAUSE

854
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
WHILE NOTHING CAN FILL THE SPACE

855
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
OF THE LOST CHILD OR LOVED ONE,

856
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
ALL OF US CAN EXTEND A HAND TO

857
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
THOSE IN NEED, TO REMIND THEM

858
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
THAT WE ARE THERE FOR THEM, THAT

859
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
WE ARE PRAYING FOR THEM, THAT

860
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
THE LOVE THEY FELT FOR THOSE

861
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
THEY LOST ENDURES NOT JUST IN

862
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
THEIR MEMORIES, BUT ALSO IN

863
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
OURS.
MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF THE

864
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
VICTIMS, AND IN THE WORDS OF

865
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
SCRIPTURE, HEAL THE

866
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
BROKENHEARTED AND BIND UP THEIR

867
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
WOUNDS.

EARLIER TODAY.

869
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
NOT JUST AS PRESIDENT, BUT AS A

870
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
FATHER OF TWO DAUGHTERS.

871
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
DENISE KORIAS' DAUGHTER GOES TO

THIS DAY HAS BEEN LIKE FOR YOU,

876
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
FOR YOUR CHILD.

877
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
HOW IS YOUR CHILD?

878
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
HOW ARE YOU?

879
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
>> I THINK EVERYONE IS COPING AS

880
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
BEST AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN, AND

881
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
IT IS SHOCKING WHEN IT HAPPENS

882
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
ANYWHERE.

883
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
SO WE'RE ALL TRYING TO WRAP OUR

884
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
ARMS AROUND THE SITUATION AS

885
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
BEST AS WE CAN.

886
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
>> DID -- DOES YOUR DAUGHTER

887
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT WITH YOU?

888
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
OR ARE YOU ENCOURAGING HER TOO?

889
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
HOW DO YOU HANDLE THIS?

890
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
A LOT OF PARENTS AROUND THE

891
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
WORLD ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

892
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
WHAT TO SAY TO THEIR CHILD.

893
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
>> YOU KNOW, THE HARD THING FOR

894
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
ME IS, ANDERSON, I'M A NEW

895
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
YORKER, SO I'M VERY ACCUSTOMED

896
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
TO MANHATTAN AND ACCUSTOMED TO

897
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
ALWAYS TELLING MY KIDS TO BE

898
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
CAREFUL.
I GUESS YOU NEVER EXPECT IT TO

899
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
HAPPEN IN YOUR SCHOOL, AND AT

900
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
THE END OF THE DAY, YOU JUST --

901
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I'M LETTING HER TALK.

902
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
SHE'S MENTIONED QUITE A BIT

903
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL, WHO MANY OF

904
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
US HAVE WORKED WITH, AND I

905
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
ADORED HER.

906
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I WORKED WITH HER PERSONALLY

907
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
WITH MY BUSINESS.

908
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
THAT IS ONE PERSON I KNOW WE'VE

909
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
LOST ON A PERSONAL LEVEL.

910
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE

911
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
COUNSELORS AT THE INTERMEDARY

912
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
SCHOOL TOMORROW, AND I ALREADY

913
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
TOLD MY CHILDREN, THEY ARE ALL

914
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
WELCOME TO GO THERE.

915
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
WE ARE PLANNING ON DOING THAT

916
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
TOMORROW, SO IF THEY NEED TO

917
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
SPEAK TO SOMEBODY, THEY WILL.

918
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
>> HAS YOUR DAUGHTER SAID MUCH

919
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
ABOUT WHAT SHE SAW OR WHAT SHE

920
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
HEARD?

921
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
>> SHE DID MENTION THAT SHE DID,

922
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
OF COURSE, HEAR GUNSHOTS, AND ON

923
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
THE SAME FLOOR, AND SHE -- HER

924
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
TEACHER, MANAGED TO TAKE TWO

925
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
CHILDREN OUT OF THE HALLWAY,

926
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
PULL THEM INTO THE CLASSROOM,

927
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
LOCK THE DOOR AND MOVE EVERYBODY

928
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM,

929
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
WHEN, YOU KNOW, IT WAS VERY

930
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
CONFUSING AS IT WOULD BE IN ANY

931
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
OF THESE CASES TO GO AND PICK UP

932
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
YOUR CHILD, ONCE WE FIGURED OUT

933
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
THAT EVERYTHING WAS DISPATCHED

934
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
TO SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY, I WAS

935
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
ONE OF THE FIRST PARENTS THERE

936
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
ALONG WITH A FRIEND OF MINE, WE

937
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
BOTH FIGURED OUT WHAT WAS GOING

938
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
ON, RAN OVER THERE, THEY WERE

939
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
VERY SMART TO GET THEM OUT OF

940
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
THE BUILDING, MOVED THEM OVER TO

941
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
THE FIREHOUSE.

942
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
YOU COULD SEE MY DAUGHTER'S

943
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
TEACHER WAS VISIBLY UPSET AS

944
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
WELL AS THE CHILDREN THERE.

945
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
SHE DID A VERY HEROIC THING.

946
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
PULLED TWO KIDS OUT OF THE

947
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
HALLWAY, SHOVED THEM INTO THE

948
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
CLASSROOM AND LOCKED THAT DOOR.

949
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
THE KIDS WILL SUFFER FROM THIS.

950
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE, A

951
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVENT THAT WILL

952
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
TAKE TIME FOR HEALING AND AS

953
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
LONG AS EVERYONE GETS THE PROPER

954
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
HELP, IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU

955
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
SHAKE OFF VERY EASILY AND

956
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
CERTAINLY NOT FOR LITTLE PEOPLE

957
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
AND WE LOST A LOT OF BABIES

958
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
TODAY IN THIS TOWN AND THERE ARE

959
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
A LOT OF VERY SAD FAMILIES, AND

960
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
AS EVERYONE CAN THINK, YOU NEVER

961
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
THINK IT WILL HAPPEN, BUT

962
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
BASICALLY IT HAPPENS ALL OVER

963
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
THE WORLD AT THIS POINT, SO WE

964
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
HAVE TO BE VERY COGNIZANT OF

965
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
MENTAL HEALTH AND GUN CONTROL IN

966
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
MY EYES AND HOW SCHOOLS ARE

967
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
LOCKED UP THESE DAYS.

968
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE.

969
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
YOU WOULDN'T THINK TO TAKE YOUR

970
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
CHILDREN TO SCHOOL YOU HAVE TO

971
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
WORRY ABOUT SOMEONE GOING IN AND

972
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
BLOWING THEM ALL UP.

973
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE STATE OF

974
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
AFFAIRS, BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,

975
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
IT'S OUR REALITY THESE DAYS.

976
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
>> DENISE, I'M SORRY THAT

977
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
REALITY WAS VISITED UPON YOUR

978
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
DAUGHTER TODAY.

979
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
AND EVERYBODY ELSE.
AND I WISH YOU STRENGTH AND

980
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
PEACE IN THE DIFFICULT DAYS

981
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
AHEAD.
THANK YOU FOR TALKING TONIGHT.

982
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
>> OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH,

983
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
ANDERSON.

984
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
>> AND THERE WILL BE A LOT OF

985
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD.

986
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
LET'S GO BACK TO SOLEDAD.
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

987
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
SO, ANDERSON, AS WORD START TO

988
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE STATE

989
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
TODAY, SO DID THE SHOCK, SO DID

990
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
THE HORROR AND NOW THERE IS THE

991
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
GRIEVING.

992
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
>> YOU CAN NEVER BE PREPARED FOR

993
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
THIS KIND OF INCIDENT.

994
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
WHAT HAS HAPPENED, WHAT HAS

995
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
TRANSPIRED AT THAT SCHOOL

996
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
BUILDING, WILL LEAVE A MARK ON

997
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
THIS COMMUNITY AND EVERY FAMILY

998
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
IMPACTED.

999
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I ONLY ASK THAT ALL OF OUR

1000
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
FELLOW CITIZENS HERE IN THE

1001
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE

1002
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
WORLD, WHO HAVE ALREADY OFFERED

1003
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
THEIR ASSISTANCE REMEMBER ALL OF

1004
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
THE VICTIMS IN THEIR PRAYERS.

1005
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
>> THAT WAS CONNECTICUT'S

1006
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
GOVERNOR, DAN MALLOY SPEAKING

1007
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
EARLIER TODAY.

1008
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
HE SAID HIS MAIN RESPONSIBILITY

1009
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
NOW IS THE INVESTIGATION ALONG

1010
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
WITH LOCAL AND FEDERAL

1011
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
AUTHORITIES.

1012
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE ONCE AGAIN

1013
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
THAT IS THE FOCUS NOW.

1014
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, HANDLING OUR

1015
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
COVERAGE OF THE INVESTIGATION.

1016
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
LET'S FOCUS FIRST ON WHAT WE

1017
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
KNOW ABOUT THE SHOOTER.

1018
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
>> NOT VERY MUCH.

1019
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THAT HE IS 20 YEARS OLD, WE

1020
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
UNDERSTAND THAT HE CAME TO THE

1021
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
SCHOOL WITH THREE WEAPONS, TWO

1022
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
OF THEM WERE HANDGUNS, ONE

1023
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
DESCRIBED AS A GLOCK.

1024
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
ONE DESCRIBED AS A SIG SAUER,

1025
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
AND ANOTHER ONE NOT FOUND IN THE

1026
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
CLASSROOM WITH HIM, BUT INSTEAD

1027
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
WAS FOUND IN A CAR OUTSIDE THE

1028
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
SCHOOL, AND THAT IS CALLED

1029
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
A .223 BUSHMASTER, A SEMI

1030
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
AUTOMATIC WEAPON.

1031
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
IT SEEMS THOSE GUNS WERE NOT

1032
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
REGISTERED TO HIM.

1033
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
BUT WE ARE TOLD ACCORDING TO OUR

1034
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES THEY

1035
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
BELONG TO HIS MOTHER WHICH IS --

1036
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
DON'T HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR

1037
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
THAT RIGHT NOW.

1038
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
>> WERE ALL THOSE GUNS LEGALLY

1039
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
PURCHASED IN THIS STATE?

1040
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
>> YES, THEY WERE LEGALLY

1041
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
PURCHASED AND PURCHASED IN THE

1042
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
STATE OF CONNECTICUT.

1043
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
WE BELIEVE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

1044
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
LIVING WITH HIS MOTHER.

1045
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
OUR SOURCES TELL US HIS MOTHER'S

1046
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
BODY WAS FOUND INSIDE A

1047
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
RESIDENCE AND SHE LIVES IN THIS

1048
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
AREA, SO IT'S POSSIBLE HE LIVED

1049
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
WITH HIS MOTHER.

1050
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
STILL WAITING ON THAT DETAIL.

1051
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
>> SOME CONFUSION AS WELL WITH

1052
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
HIS BROTHER.

1053
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
POLICE WENT TO HOBOKEN TO DO AN

1054
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
INVESTIGATION THERE, AND TOOK

1055
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
THE BROTHER OFF FOR QUESTIONING

1056
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
AS WELL.
>> THE BROTHER IS OLDER, 24

1057
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
YEARS OLD, HE DOES LIVE IN AN

1058
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
APARTMENT IN HOBOKEN, AND THEY

1059
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
DID GO TO HIM TO ASK HIM

1060
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS BROTHER.

1061
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
EVERYBODY TIGHTLIPPED ABOUT

1062
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
EXACTLY WHAT HE TOLD THE

1063
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
AUTHORITIES.

1064
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
BUT ALSO HIS FATHER HAS BEEN

1065
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
QUESTIONED AS WELL.

1066
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
HIS FATHER IS DIVORCED FROM THE

1067
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
MOTHER WHO WAS KILLED IN THIS

1068
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
INCIDENT AND WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING

00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
WELL.

1071
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
>> SUSAN CANNDIOTTI, THE

INVESTIGATION CONTINUES.

WE'RE INTENTIONALLY LIMITING THE

00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
USE OF THE KILLER'S NAME.

1080
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
WE DON'T WANT TO USE IT OVER AND

1081
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
OVER AGAIN.
WE ARE TRYING TO LEARN MORE

1082
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
ABOUT WHAT LED THIS PERSON TO

DREW GRIFFIN JOINS US LIVE.

BEGINNING PLAY OUT IN EXACT THAT

00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
WILL ORDER.
HERE IS WHAT WE DO KNOW.

1095
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
THE 20-YEAR-OLD SHOOTER HAD AN

1096
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
OLDER BROTHER.

1097
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
THAT BROTHER REPORTEDLY TOLD ABC

00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
NEWS THAT THE SHOOTER HAD A

00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
PERSONALITY DISORDER AND ALSO

1100
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
MENTIONED AUTISM.

1101
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
CNN HEARD THAT SAME INFORMATION

1102
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
FROM A MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF A

1103
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
FRIEND OF THE SHOOTER'S IN

1104
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
NEWTOWN WHERE THE SHOOTER LIVED.

1105
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
WE CAN CONFIRM THE GUNS, TWO

1106
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
HANDGUNS AND SEMI AUTOMATIC

1107
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
RIFLE WERE LEGALLY OWNED BY THE

1108
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
SHOOTER'S MOTHER, NOW DECEASED,

1109
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
YOU CAN SEE THE PICTURE OF THE

1110
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
GUN THERE, AND SOMEWHAT STANDARD

1111
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
IN THESE CASES, WE FIND PEOPLE

1112
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
THAT ARE SHOCKED THAT THE

1113
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
PARTICULAR SHOOTER COULD HAVE

1114
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
BEEN INVOLVED IN ANYTHING LIKE

1115
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
THIS, AS IS THE CASE WITH ONE OF

1116
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
THE SHOOTER'S FORMER CLASSMATES

1117
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
AND FORMER SCHOOL BUS DRIVER.

1118
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
>> HE WAS JUST A KID.

1119
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
>> JUST A KID?

1120
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
>> JUST A KID.

1121
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
>> NEVER ANTI SOCIAL?

1122
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
>> NO, NO.

1123
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
>> TROUBLE MAKER?

1124
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
>> NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

1125
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
>> NOTICEABLE?

1126
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
DID HE JUST KIND OF BLEND INTO

1127
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
THE BACKGROUND?

1128
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
>> YEAH.

1129
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
NOTHING THAT WOULD WARRANT ANY

1130
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
OF THIS.

1131
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
>> HE WENT AFTER HER MOM AND HER

1132
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
CLASS OF KIDS, CAN YOU WRAP YOUR

1133
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
HEAD AROUND THAT?

1134
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
>> NO, I CANNOT.

1135
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD DO

1136
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
ANYTHING LIKE THIS?

1137
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
>> YOUR GENERAL SENSE IS WHAT?

1138
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
>> THIS IS -- THIS IS

1139
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
UNSPEAKABLE.
WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT --

1140
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I'M STILL IN SHOCK.

1141
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
EXCUSE ME A MOMENT.

1142
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I WANT TO GO.

1143
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
>> HE WAS A NICE KID.

1144
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
VERY POLITELY.

1145
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
SHE RAISED VERY NICE BOYS TO ME.

1146
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S A SHOCK.

1147
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
TO EVEN KNOW THEM AND REALIZE

1148
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
WHO THEY ARE, AND WHAT HE DID.

1149
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT

1150
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
HAPPENED THAT HE SNAPPED, WHAT

1151
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
HAVE YOU, AND TOOK SUCH INNOCENT

1152
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
LIVES.
>> SO WHAT CAN WE EXPECT?

1153
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
WELL, ANDERSON, AS WE'VE LEARNED

1154
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
IN THE OTHER CASES, VIRGINIA

1155
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
TECH, THE SHOOTING OF

1156
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
CONGRESSMAN GIFFORDS, THE MASS

1157
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
KILLING AT THE MOVIE THEATER IN

1158
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
AURORA, COLORADO, IN THE COMING

1159
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
DAYS, MAYBE BY TOMORROW, WE'LL

1160
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
SEE MULTIPLE WARNING SIGNS,

1161
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
DANGEROUS MESSAGES, IGNORED OR

1162
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
PERHAPS OR EVEN PRACTICE

1163
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
SESSIONS OR AN OBSESSION WITH

1164
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
THE MOM'S GUNS THAT WEREN'T

1165
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
TAKEN SERIOUSLY OR THE FAMILY IN

1166
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
MANY CASES DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO

1167
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
HANDLE THE SITUATION.
THEY DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO TURN

1168
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
AND THERE WILL NEVER BE AN

1169
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
ANSWER OR EXPLANATION THAT COULD

1170
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
BE ANYWHERE NEAR GOOD ENOUGH FOR

1171
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES TO

1172
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
UNDERSTAND THIS, BECAUSE IN A

1173
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
LOT OF CASES, IT'S JUST

1174
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
SENSELESS AND IT'S NEVER GOING

1175
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
TO BE UNDERSTOOD.

1176
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
>> YEAH, AND HEARING THE -- ONE

1177
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
OF THE PEOPLE SAY AUTISTIC, OR

1178
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
COULD BE AUTISTIC, THAT -- I

1179
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
MEAN, I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF

1180
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
SOMEBODY AUTISTIC DOING

1181
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1182
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT JIVES.

1183
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
>> IT'S TWO SEPARATE THINGS.

1184
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
THE BROTHER SAID PERSONALITY

1185
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
DISORDER AND ALSO AUTISTIC.

1186
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PUT THOSE

1187
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
TOGETHER OR SAY ONE LEADS TO THE

1188
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
OTHER.
>> GOT IT.

1189
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
>> BUT SOME HINTS, EARLY HINTS,

1190
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
LIKE WE'VE SEEN IN THE OTHER

1191
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
CASES, EARLY HINT WHERE THERE IS

1192
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
SOME SORT OF MENTAL ISSUE GOING

1193
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
ON AND WE LEARN AS THINGS GO ON

1194
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
THAT THERE ARE WARNING SIGNS.

1195
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
THAT'S WHAT I EXPECT.

1196
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
THAT'S WHAT I'VE SEEN OTHER

1197
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
EXPERTS EXPECT TALKING ABOUT

1198
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
THIS.
>> AND THERE WILL BE DEBATE OVER

1199
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
GUN ISSUES, GUN CONTROLS.

1200
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
CONNECTICUT HAS VERY STRICT GUN

1201
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
LAWS AND THESE GUNS WERE LEGALLY

1202
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
PURCHASED AS FAR AS WE KNOW BY

1203
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
THE MOTHER.

1204
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
>> IF YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE A

1205
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
GUN LAW TO PREVENT THIS, YOU

1206
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THIS WOMAN'S

1207
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
LEGALLY OWNED GUNS AWAY THE

1208
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
REASON WE FOUND OUT SO SOON

1209
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
WHERE THESE GUNS CAME FROM,

1210
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
CONNECTICUT HAS IT'S OWN

1211
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
REGISTRY, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

1212
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
CERTIFICATE TO OWN A HANDGUN

1213
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
THAT COMES WITH A -- A TEST --

1214
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
NOT A TEST, BUT A CLASS.

1215
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
A HANDGUN SAFETY CLASS.

1216
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
NO ONE UNDER 21 CAN OWN A

1217
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
HANDGUN AND THEY HAVE AN ASSAULT

1218
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
WEAPONS BAN.

1219
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
THIS ASSAULT RIFLE, I DON'T HAVE

1220
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
THE DETAILS IF IT WAS LEGALLY

1221
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
OWNED, SHE MUST HAVE OWNED IT

1222
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
BEFORE 1993 AND ALSO HAD A

1223
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
CERTIFICATE OF POSSESSION

1224
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
REGISTERED WITH THE STATE.

1225
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
SOME OF THE OLDER GUNS WERE

1226
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
GRANDFATHERED IN.

1227
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
CAN'T HAVE AN ASSAULT WEAPON

1228
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
PURCHASED IN CONNECTICUT AS I

1229
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
READ FROM THE LAW.

1230
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
>> HOW WERE THEY STORED?

1231
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
IN A LOCKED BOX?

1232
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
A LOT WE DON'T KNOW.

1233
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
DREW, APPRECIATE IT.

1234
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
>>> FOR PARENTS, THE ORDEAL

1235
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
BEGAN WITH THE WORD THAT SANDY

1236
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WAS ON

1237
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
LOCKDOWN.
THE FIRST WORD THAT PARENTS GOT.

1238
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL HAVE

1239
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
MORE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

1240
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

1241
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
of Washington about the future
of Medicare and Social Security.

1242
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
ANNCR: But you deserve straight
talk about the options on the...

1243
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
table and what they mean for you
and your family.

1244
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
ANCR: AARP is cutting through
all the political spin.

1245
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Because for our 37 million
members, only one word counts.

1246
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Get the facts at earnedasay.org.
Let's keep Medicare...

1247
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
and Social Security strong for
generations to come.

1248
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
>>> I WAS IN NEW YORK, AND MY

1249
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
WIFE CALLED ME IN HISSTERRICS,

1250
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
SO I RUSHED HOME, AND SHE -- SHE

1251
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
HEARD SOME BANGS AND SHE WENT

1252
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
RUNNING INTO A BATHROOM.

1253
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
>> IT WAS FRIGHTENING, IT WAS

1254
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
LIKE MY HEART STOPPED BEATING.

1255
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN IT.

1256
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
>> JASON CARROLL GAVE US A LOOK

1257
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
INSI

1258
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000

PASTO

PASTOR.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A PARENT?

1262
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A PARENT WHO

1263
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
IS GOING THROUGH THE WORST

1264
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
POSSIBLE KIND OF GRIEF

1265
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
IMAGINABLE?

1266
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
>> YOU KNOW, I HAD A NUMBER OF

1267
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
CONVERSATIONS WITH PARENTS

1268
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
TODAY.
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE BELONG TO THE

1269
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
PARISH COMMUNITY.

1270
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
THE WORDS ARE FEW.

1271
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
WHAT CAN YOU SAY?

1272
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
MANY SAID THANK YOU FOR MANY

1273
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
HERE WITH US.

1274
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
WE PRAYED TOGETHER, HUGGED EACH

1275
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
OTHER, A LOT OF TEARS.

1276
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
CERTAINLY A LOT OF EMOTION, AND

1277
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I -- I DON'T REALLY THINK IT'S

1278
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
SETTLED INTO THEIR LIVES.

1279
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
THEIR CHILD HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM

1280
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
THEM.

1281
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I MUST SAY FOR THE PARENTS I

1282
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
SPOKE WITH TODAY, THERE WAS A

1283
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LOVE FOR

1284
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
THESE CHILDREN, AND I KNOW THAT

1285
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
THE DAYS AHEAD ARE GOING TO BE

1286
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.
WE AS A COMMUNITY, CERTAINLY AS

1287
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
A CHURCH COMMUNITY WILL BE VERY

1288
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
PRESENT TO THEM.

1289
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
BUT THE WORDS?

1290
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
WHAT CAN YOU SAY AT A TIME LIKE

1291
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
THIS?

1292
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF PARENTS

1293
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
WRESTLING AROUND THE COUNTRY AND

1294
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
AROUND THE WORLD WITH WHAT ARE

1295
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
THEY GOING TO SAY TO THEIR

1296
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
CHILDREN WHO ASK THEM QUESTIONS

1297
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
ABOUT THIS.

1298
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND FOR PEOPLE

1299
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
TO SAY TO THEIR KIDS.

1300
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
NOT KIDS AT NEWTOWN AT THE

1301
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
SCHOOL, BUT CHILDREN WHO HEAR

1302
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
ABOUT THIS, WANT TO KNOW IF THEY

1303
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
ARE SAFE, WANT TO KNOW ABOUT

1304
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> THAT'S THE ONE THING YOU HAVE

1305
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
TO ASSURE THEM.

1306
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE

1307
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
BEYOND ANY HUMAN CONTROL.

1308
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
WE HAVE TO TEACH THESE CHILDREN

1309
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
THEY HAVE TO TRUST.

1310
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
YOU KNOW, I KNOW IT'S A

1311
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
DIFFICULT WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE

1312
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
AND VERY DIFFICULT TO TRUST

1313
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
EVERYONE, BUT THEY HAVE TO HAVE

1314
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
FAITH, FAITH IN GOD AND FAITH

1315
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
WITH EACH OTHER AND I HOPE

1316
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
PARENTS LEARN THE VALUE OF

1317
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
FAMILY AND KEEP THE VALUES

1318
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
STRAIGHT.

1319
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
THE CHILDREN NEED TO KNOW THEY

1320
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
ARE LOVED AND THEY ARE IN AN

1321
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY CAN GROW

1322
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
UP TO BE PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS.

1323
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU TAKE FEAR

1324
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
OUT OF A CHILD'S HEART EXCEPT BY

1325
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
LOVE.
AND THESE CHILDREN WERE DEEPLY

1326
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
LOVED BY THEIR PARENTS.

1327
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I'M SURE WHEN THEY DROPPED THEIR

1328
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
CHILDREN OFF AT THE SCHOOL, THE

1329
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
LAST THING ON THEIR MINDS IS

1330
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
THIS THE WAY THE DAY WOULD END.

1331
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I HOPE PARENTS TAKE THE

1332
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THEIR

1333
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
CHILDREN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

1334
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
BEING FAMILY AND THE IMPORTANCE

1335
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
OF TRUSTING AND LOVING EACH

1336
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
OTHER.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS

1337
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
THINKING ABOUT TODAY, AFTER THE

1338
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
AURORA SHOOTING IN AURORA,

1339
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
COLORADO, THEY HAD A SORT OF

1340
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
MEMORIAL SERVICE, AND I REMEMBER

1341
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
THE SPEAKERS WOULD READ THE NAME

1342
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
OF EACH PERSON WHO WAS KILLED,

1343
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
AND THEN THE CROWD WOULD SHOUT

1344
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
BACK, WE WILL REMEMBER.

1345
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
WE WILL REMEMBER YOU.

1346
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
THAT WAS SO POWERFUL.
AND I KEPT THINKING ABOUT THAT

1347
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
TODAY, OUR COVERAGE TONIGHT.

1348
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
WE EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF

1349
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS.

1350
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
AND WE SAW THAT TONIGHT AT THE

1351
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
VIGIL, PEOPLE WERE LITERALLY --

1352
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
THEY WERE OUTSIDE.

1353
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
IT WAS SO MANY PEOPLE WANTING TO

1354
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
GO.

1355
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
THEY COULDN'T FIT IN.

1356
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
WHAT WAS YOUR MESSAGE TONIGHT?

1357
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
>> OUR MESSAGE, I THUT THIS WAS

1358
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
A DAY ABOUT HEARTS.

1359
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I WITNESSED THIS MORNING, BEING

1360
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
WITH THE FAMILIES, WITH THEM FOR

1361
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
ALMOST SIX HOURS.

1362
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
COMPASSIONATE HEARTS, BROKEN

1363
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
HEARTS, CARING HEARTS.

1364
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
REALLY ABOUT LOVE IN SO MANY

1365
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
WAYS, AND LOVE LOST, BUT LOVE

1366
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
THAT WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN.

1367
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TONIGHT --

1368
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

1369
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY,

1370
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
VIOLENCE IN THE MEDIA, VIOLENCE

1371
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.

1372
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
IT IS FILLING THEIR HEADS WITH

1373
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
AN AWARENESS THAT EVIL DOES

1374
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
EXIST IN THIS WORLD, BUT THAT

1375
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
GOOD ALWAYS CONQUERS EVIL AND

1376
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
THE ONLY WAY WE'LL CHANGE IS BY

1377
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
COMING TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY,

1378
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED

1379
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
TONIGHT.
PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER TO SUPPORT

1380
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
EACH OTHER AND TO ENCOURAGE EACH

1381
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
OTHER.

1382
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
TO LET EACH OTHER KNOW THERE IS

1383
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
A BETTER WAY TO LIVE.

1384
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID IF WE

1385
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
WORK TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY.

1386
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
>> MONSIGNOR, I KNOW IT'S BEEN A

1387
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
LONG DAY FOR YOU, A HORRIFIC DAY

1388
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
FOR YOU.

1389
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME

1390
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
TO TALK TO US.

1391
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
THANK YOU.

1392
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
>> THANK YOU.

1393
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
>> AGAIN, SOLEDAD, AS WE'VE BEEN

1394
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
SAYING ALL NIGHT LONG AND ALL

1395
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
DAY LONG, THERE WILL BE MANY

1396
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD.

1397
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
>> NO QUESTION, FOR THOSE WHO

1398
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
HAVE LOST CHILDREN AND THOSE

1399
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
WHOSE CHILDREN SURVIVED.

1400
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
TOUGH CONVERSATIONS.

1401
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
MANY WERE TELLING US WHAT

1402
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
HAPPENED WHEN THEY CAME RACING

1403
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1404
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
THEY GOT WORD THAT THE SCHOOL

1405
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
WAS ON LOCKDOWN AND THEY WERE

1406
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
PANICKED.
SOME TRIED TO RUN TO THE SCHOOL.

1407
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
SENT TO A NEARBY FIRE STATION,

1408
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
COMPLETELY FRANTIC SCENE BY ALL

1409
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
ACCOUNTS WE'VE HEARD.

1410
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
PEOPLE HAD TO BASICALLY SIT AND

1411
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
WAIT TO SEE IF THEIR CHILDREN

1412
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
WERE ALIVE OR NOT.

1413
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
EARLIER, I SPOKE WITH CHRISTINE

1414
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
WILFORD ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE.

1415
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
HER SON IS A SECOND GRADER AT

1416
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
THE SCHOOL.

1417
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
HOW ARE YOU DOING NOW?

1418
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
>> IT'S STILL PROCESSING.

1419
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
IT'S -- IT'S SCARY, SCARY.

1420
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
NO WORDS.

1421
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
>> HOW IS YOUR SON DOING?

1422
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
ARE YOU ENCOURAGING HIM TO TALK

1423
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
AND SHARE OR TRYING TO TAKE HIS

1424
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
MIND OFF THE TERRIBLE THINGS

1425
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
THAT HE WITNESSED AND
EXPERIENCES?

1426
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
>> WE'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT OF

1427
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
EACH.

1428
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
TRY TO SPOIL HIM AND, YOU KNOW,

1429
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
TAKE HIS MIND OFF, LET HIM PLAY

1430
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
THE PS3, STUFF LIKE THAT, AND

1431
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
THEN TRYING TO TALK AND PROCESS

1432
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
WITH HIM, LETTING THEM KNOW WHEN

1433
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
WE FOUND OUT ABOUT OTHER

1434
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
CHILDREN THAT HE KNOWS.

1435
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
>> YOU'VE GOTTEN AN ELECTRONIC

1436
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
ALERT IS REALLY HOW YOU GOT THE

1437
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
MESSAGE, A ROBOCALL.

1438
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
HOW DID THAT COME ACROSS?

1439
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
WHAT WAS SAID?

1440
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE MOST

1441
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
TERRIFYING THING.

1442
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
>> MY HUSBAND AND I WERE SITTING

1443
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
THERE, AND A NEIGHBOR WAS OVER

1444
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
AND WE GOT A ROBOCALL THAT ALL

1445
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
NEWTOWN SCHOOLS WERE IN LOCKDOWN

1446
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
DUE TO A REPORTED SHOOTING.

1447
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
WE IMMEDIATELY GOT ONLINE.

1448
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
MY NEIGHBOR CALLED HER HUSBAND

1449
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
AND HE SAID HE HEARD IT WAS

1450
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
SANDY HOOK.

1451
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
WE HOPPED IN THE CAR AND WENT

1452
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
DOWN.

1453
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
>> THE SCHOOL WAS ON LOCKDOWN.

1454
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1455
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
>> I'M NOT SURE COMPLETELY WHAT

1456
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
THAT MEANS.
WHEN I GOT THERE, ALL OF THE

1457
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
CHILDREN EVACUATED WERE IN THE

1458
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
FIREHOUSE.

1459
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
WHICH IS CLOSE PITCH.

1460
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
>> HOW ARE THE KIDS HOLDING UP?

1461
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
>> IT VARIES.

1462
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
MY SON SEEMED TO BE OKAY.

1463
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
MOM, I'M OKAY, I'M SAFE.

1464
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
HE GAVE ME A BIG HUG.

1465
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
A LOT OF CHILDREN WERE CRYING

1466
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
AND SCARED.

1467
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
>> HOW DID HE DESCRIBE WHAT

1468
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
HAPPENED?

1469
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
>> HE SAID HE HEARD WHAT SOUNDED

1470
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
LIKE LARGE PANS FALLING, JUST

1471
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
LOUD NOISES.

1472
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
HE SAID HIS TEACHER STEPPED

1473
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM,

1474
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
IMMEDIATELY CAME BACK IN AND

1475
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
LOCKED THE DOOR AND HAD THEM ALL

1476
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
GET INTO A CORNER AND SIT DOWN

1477
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
AND JUST HAD THEM START READING

1478
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
QUIETLY.
>> HOW MUCH TIME WENT BY BETWEEN

1479
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
THAT HAPPENED AND BEFORE HE WAS

1480
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
ABLE TO GET TO YOU?

1481
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1482
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
HE ISN'T ABLE TO PIECE HOW MUCH

1483
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
TIME ACTUALLY PASSED.

1484
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
HE SAID AFTER A LITTLE WHILE, A

1485
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
POLICE OFFICER CAME AND TOOK
THEM OUT OF THE BUILDING AND

1486
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
BROUGHT THEM TO THE FIREHOUSE.

1487
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
>> WE KNOW THAT THE PRINCIPAL

1488
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
HAD INSTALLED A SYSTEM WHERE YOU

1489
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
HAVE TO BE BUZZED IN.

1490
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
>> YES.
AND IT'S BEEN THAT WAY FOR THE

1491
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN HERE.

1492
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
YOU HAD TO RING A DOORBELL AND

1493
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
BE LET IN, AND THE OFFICE IS

1494
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THOSE DOORS,

1495
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
THEY CAN LOOK OUT AND SEE WHO IS

1496
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
AT THE DOOR?

1497
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
>> ANY PARTICULAR REASON FOR

1498
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
THAT?

1499
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
IT'S VERY TYPICAL IN BIG CITIES,

1500
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
BUT COMMUNITIES PRETTY RURAL, A

1501
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
LITTLE BIT OF A RARITY

1502
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
SOMETIMES?
>> I THINK THEY TAKE THE SAFETY

1503
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
OF OUR CHILDREN VERY SERIOUS.

1504
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
IT'S A FAIRLY LARGE SCHOOL.

1505
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
THERE'S BETWEEN 500 AND 600

1506
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
STUDENTS THERE, AND THEY WANT TO

1507
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
KEEP CONTROL, AND, YOU KNOW WHO

1508
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
IS IN THE BUILDING WITH OUR

1509
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
CHILDREN.
>> I WAS TALKING TO THE STATE

1510
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
POLICE, AND THEY SAID THEY ARE

1511
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
PROCESSING THE SCENE STILL,

1512
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
WHICH MEANS THERE ARE CHILDREN

1513
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
STILL INSIDE.

1514
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN TO YOUR SON

1515
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
WHAT HAS HAPPENED ABOUT HIS

1516
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
CLASSMATES?

1517
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
>> WE -- WE ARE A FAIRLY

1518
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
RELIGIOUS FAMILY AND WE JUST HAD

1519
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
TALKED ABOUT THAT THEY HAD GONE

1520
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
TO HEAVEN, AND TO, YOU KNOW, BE

1521
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
WITH JESUS AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL

1522
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
WE CAN SAY.

1523
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
YOU KNOW, AND TALK ABOUT YOU'RE

1524
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
NOT GOING TO SEE THEM ANYMORE

1525
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
AND NOT GOING TO BE AROUND, AND

1526
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
IT'S -- YOU REALLY JUST STRUGGLE

1527
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
TO FIND THE WORDS, YOU KNOW, AS

1528
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
TO WHAT HAPPENED.

1529
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
>> YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT EVERYONE

1530
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
IS SENDING THEIR WELL WISHES,

1531
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
NOT JUST TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY,

1532
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
BUT TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE.

1533
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000

1537
