65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
COMMENTS FROM LAST NIGHT'S

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
VIGIL.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
>> I AM VERY MINDFUL THAT MER

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
WORDS CANNOT MATCH THE DEPTHS OF

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
YOUR SORROW, NOR CAN THEY HEAL

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
YOUR WOUNDED HEARTS.

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I CAN ONLY HOPE IT HELPS FOR YOU

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
YOUR GRIEF, THAT OUR WORLD TOO

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
HAS BEEN TORN APART.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
THAT ALL ACROSS THIS LAND OF

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
OURS WE HAVE WEPT WITH YOU.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
WE'VE PULLED OUR CHILDREN TIGHT.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
AND YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHATEVER

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
MEASURE OF COMFORT WE CAN

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
PROVIDE, WE WILL PROVIDE.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
WHATEVER PORTION OF SADNESS THAT

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU TO EASE

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
THIS HEAVY LOAD, WE WILL GLADLY

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
BEAR.

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
NEWTOWN, YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
>> THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS ARE

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
PROVIDING A MEASURE OF COMFORT

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
FOR THE FAMILIES OF THOSE

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
KILLED.
AFTER LAST NIGHT'S VIGIL, WE

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
SPOKE WITH THE PARENTS AND

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
SIBLINGS OF VICKI SOTO.

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
SHE'S THE FIRST GRADE TEACHER

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
WHO WAS SHOOING HER STUDENTS

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
AWAY FROM THE DOOR WHEN THE

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
GUNMAN BURST IN AND SHOT HER.

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
>> I APPRECIATE ALL HIS KIND

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
WORDS THAT HE DID SAY ABOUT MY

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
SISTER.
SHE WAS A HERO, AND SHE STILL

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
IS.
>> I WOULD JUST LIKE EVERYONE TO

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
KNOW THAT SHE WAS JUST A

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY.

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
SHE HAD SUCH PASSION FOR

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
TEACHING AND FOR LIFE, AND

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
ESPECIALLY FOR HER FAMILY.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
SHE WAS EXTREMELY CLOSE TO HER

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
SIBLINGS THAT ARE SITTING WITH

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
ME AND HER COUSINS AND LOVED

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
THEM DEARLY AND WANTED TO BE A

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
TEACHER FROM THE TIME SHE WAS 3.

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THAT'S ALL SHE EVER WANTED TO

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
DO, AND SHE JUST LOVED HER KIDS.

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
SHE JUST TALKED ABOUT THEM ALL

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
THE TIME WITH SUCH FONDNESS AND

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
CARING, AND SHE JUST ADORED

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
THEM.
I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND SHE

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
DID EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
PROTECT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THEM.
>> INVESTIGATORS SAY VICKI SOTO

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
ALMOST CERTAINLY SAVED LIVES BY

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
ACTING SO QUICKLY.

121
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
THE NEWTOWN TRAGEDY IS THE

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
NATION'S FOURTH MASS SHOOTING IN

123
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
JUST THE PAST TWO YEARS, AND IN

124
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
THE AFTERMATH OF EACH,

125
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
CONVERSATION NATURALLY TURNS TO

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
THE ISSUE OF GUN CONTROL.

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
THIS TIME, HOWEVER, THE TONE

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
SEEMS DIFFERENT.

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
LISTEN TO THE PRESIDENT'S

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
RESOLVE IN HIS SPEECH LAST

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
NIGHT.

132
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
>> IN THE COMING WEEKS, I'LL USE

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE HOLDS

134
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
TO ENGAGE MY FELLOW CITIZENS

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO MENTAL

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO PARENTS

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
AND EDUCATORS IN AN EFFORT AIMED

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
AT PREVENTING MORE TRAGEDIES

139
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
LIKE THIS.

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
>> CNN'S DAN LOTHIAN IS AT THE

141
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
WHITE HOUSE THIS MORNING.

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
DAN, THE PRESIDENT VOWED ACTION,

143
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
BUT HE OFFERED NO SPECIFICS.

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
WHAT KIND OF REFORMS COULD HE

145
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
PUSH FOR?

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
>> Reporter: WELL, I THINK, AS

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
SOME PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT,

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
MAYBE DURING THAT SERVICE WASN'T

149
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
THE TIME FOR THE PRESIDENT TO BE

150
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
LAYING OUT ANY SPECIFICS, BUT A

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
COUPLE OF THINGS WE COULD SEE

152
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
THE PRESIDENT DO, FIRST OF ALL,

153
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
THERE'S THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
WHICH EXPIRED IN 2004.

155
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
THAT HAD BEEN IN PLACE FOR TEN

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
YEARS.

157
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
THE PRESIDENT DURING THE 2008

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
CAMPAIGN SAID HE SUPPORTED IT,

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
BUT THERE WAS NO REAL MOVEMENT

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
IN THAT AREA.

161
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
IN FACT, THE BRADY CENTER TO

162
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE SAID AFTER

163
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST YEAR IN

164
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
OFFICE WAS A, QUOTE, ABJECT

165
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
FAILURE WHEN IT COMES TO THIS

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
ISSUE.

167
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
WE COULD SEE THE PRESIDENT PUT

168
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
MORE PRESSURE ON LAWMAKERS TO

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
REINSTATE THAT ASSAULT WEAPONS

170
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
BAN.

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
PERHAPS THE PRESIDENT COULD ALSO

172
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
FOCUS ON STRENGTHENING MENTAL

173
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
HEALTH LAWS THAT WOULD PREVENT

174
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
THOSE WITH DIFFICULT MENTAL

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
HEALTH ISSUES FROM GETTING THESE

176
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
DANGEROUS WEAPONS AND THEN

177
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
CARRYING OUT THESE MASS

178
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
SHOOTINGS.
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE AREAS

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
WHERE WE COULD SEE THE PRESIDENT

180
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
PUSH.

181
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
BUT, AGAIN, WE HAVEN'T HEARD THE

182
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
PRESIDENT LAY OUT ANY SPECIFICS,

183
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
AND IT REALLY HASN'T BEEN A BIG

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
PRIORITY FOR THE PRESIDENT

185
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
DURING HIS FIRST FOUR YEARS, AND

186
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WHEN IT COMES TO CONGRESS, THERE

187
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
HAVE BEEN SOME BILLS, SOME GUN

188
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
RELATED BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT

189
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
FORWARD BUT REALLY WENT NOWHERE.

190
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
THERE IS SOME INDICATION NOW

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
THIS IS SOMETHING LAWMAKERS

192
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
COULD START LOOKING AT, BUT

193
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE,

194
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
CAROL.

195
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
>> DAN, SADLY, WE HAVE BEEN DOWN

196
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
THIS ROAD SO MANY TIMES, TOO

197
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
MANY TIMES.

198
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
NOTHING REALLY CHANGES.

199
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I MEAN THAT AS FAR AS GUN

200
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
CONTROL LAWS GO, HELP FOR PEOPLE

201
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, MORE MONEY

202
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
BEING POURED INTO PSYCHIATRIC

203
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
CENTERS OR COUNSELING CENTERS

204
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
THAT MIGHT HELP PEOPLE.

205
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
NOTHING IS EVER ACCOMPLISHED.

206
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
IS THE TONE DIFFERENT THIS TIME?

207
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
>> Reporter: THE TONE IS ALWAYS

208
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
DIFFERENT AFTER A MASS SHOOTING.

209
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
WE HEARD THE SAME THING AFTER

210
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
AURORA.
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN INVOLVED

211
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
OR HAD TO DEAL WITH FOUR MASS

212
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
SHOOTINGS DURING HIS PRESIDENCY,

213
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
AND THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF

214
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
TOUGH TALK, AND THIS DEBATE

215
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
REALLY INTENSIFIES IN THE DAYS

216
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
FOLLOWING THESE MASS SHOOTINGS,

217
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
BUT THEN NOTHING REALLY HAPPENS.

218
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
WE DO SEE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

219
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
TONE WHERE YOU HEAR LAWMAKERS

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
TALKING ABOUT GOING UP TO

221
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
CAPITOL HILL AND REALLY PUSHING

222
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
FORWARD ON SOMETHING, BUT WE

223
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
DON'T KNOW.

224
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.

225
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000

229
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
THERE'S THE FISCAL CLIFF

230
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
OBVIOUSLY THAT NEEDS TO BE

231
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
RESOLVED BEFORE THE END OF THE

232
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
YEAR.
SO WE'LL HAVE TO SEE ONCE THOSE

233
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
ISSUES ARE DEALT WITH, WHETHER

234
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000

235

INSTALLED IN THE SCHOOL.

267

YOUNGER THAN HER HUSBAND GEORGE,

OUR DREAM WAS A CHRONOLOGICAL

316
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
BE WONDERFUL.

ON THIS DAY, THEY HAVE LEARNED

353
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000

TWO TEACHERS WHO SURVIVED TOLD

THE GUNMAN, AND SHE COULD NOT --

365
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
SHE COULD HAVE AVOIDED THAT, AND

366
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
SHE DIDN'T.
I KNEW SHE WOULDN'T.

367
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000

368
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000

POLICE SAY ADAM LANZA'S FIRST

577
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
TARGET ON FRIDAY WAS HIS MOTHER.

578
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
SOME WHO KNEW NANCY LANZA CALL

579
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
HER A REASONABLE NEIGHBOR, A

580
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
FRIEND WHO -- A PERSONAL AND

581
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
REASONABLE NEIGHBOR.

582
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
A FRIEND WHO -- ONE OF HER SONS

583
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
CALL HER A SOCIAL BUTTERFLY.

584
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY FOR HER

585
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
SON ADAM.

586
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
NANCY PULLED HER SON OUT OF THE

587
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
SCHOOL DISTRICT AND HOME

588
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
SCHOOLED HIM.

589
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
THOSE WHO KNEW ADAM REMEMBER HIM

590
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
FOR NOT STANDING OUT.

591
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
>> BASICALLY, HE WAS A QUIET,

592
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
SHY KID.

593
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
HE STOOD OUT TO ME BECAUSE OF

594
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
THE FACT HE DIDN'T INTERACT WITH

595
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
TOO MANY OTHER KIDS ON THE BUS.

596
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
HE WAS OLDER, I BELIEVE, WHEN I

597
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
HAD HIM.
THIS IS GOING BACK A FEW YEARS.

598
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I DON'T RECALL EVERYTHING, BUT

599
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
THAT DID STAND OUT.

600
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
THE ONE THING ABOUT IT.

601
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
>> THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT ADAM

602
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
LANZA, THE MORE CONFUSING IT

603
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
BECOMES.

604
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
CNN'S BRIAN TODD LOOKS DEEPER

605
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000

CONFLICTING.
A NEIGHBOR WHO KNEW HIM IN

615
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000

THE BACKGROUND?

628
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
>> YEAH.
NOTHING THAT WOULD WARRANT ANY

YEARS AGO WHEN LANZA WAS 10 AND

KRAFT WAS 15.

634
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
HE DESCRIBES LANZA AS FOCUSED,

635
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
QUIET, INTROVERTED.

636
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000

637
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
VIOLENCE, KRAFT SAYS, BUT HE

638
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
SAYS LANZA DID THROW THE

639
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
OCCASIONAL TEMPER TANTRUM.

640

>> JUST GENERAL STUFF LIKE WE

641
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
HAD TO PUT HIM TO BED AND HE

642
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
WOULDN'T LIKE THAT OR STOP

643
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
WATCHING TV AND HE WOULDN'T LIKE

644
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
THAT.
NORMAL STUFF KIDS DO, BUT I

645
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
GUESS THE A10 YEARS OLD NORMAL

646
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
KIDS GET OUT OF THAT PHASE, AND

647
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ADAM.

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
WE ARE HOLDING BOTH CRIME

920
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
SCENES, THE SCHOOL AND THE

921
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
SECONDARY CRIME SCENE,

922
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
INDEFINITELY.
WE'VE SEIZED IT UNDER SEARCH

923
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
WARRANTS, AND WE'RE GOING TO

924
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
HOLD THOSE LOCATIONS UNTIL WE'VE

925
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
COMPLETED OUR WORK AND WE FEEL

926
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
IT IS APPROPRIATE TO LET THEM

927
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
GO.
SO AS NOT TO READ ANYTHING INTO

928
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
THAT, IT IS COMMON PRACTICE TO

929
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
DO THAT, TO HOLD ON TO THE CRIME

930
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
SCENE AS LONG AS IT'S NEEDED FOR

931
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
INVESTIGATORY PURPOSES.

932
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
WE HAD BEGUN PROCESSING THE

933
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
EVIDENCE, ANALYZING THE

934
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
EVIDENCE.

935
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
AS I STATED YESTERDAY, JUST TO

936
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
USE AN EXAMPLE, THE WEAPONRY,

937
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
EVERY SINGLE FACET OF THE

938
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
WEAPONS WILL BE ANALYZED.

939
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
EVERY SINGLE ROUND OF AMMUNITION

940
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
WILL BE LOOKED AT AND EXAMINED

941
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
FOR ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL

942
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
EVIDENCE.
I ALLUDED YESTERDAY TO THE

943
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
VOLUME OF ROUNDS, FOR EXAMPLE,

944
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
THAT, IN FACT, WERE SEIZED AND

945
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
RECOVERED.

946
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
EACH SINGULAR ROUND WILL BE

947
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
EXAMINED.
IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE

948
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
PAINSTAKING LENGTH OF THAT

949
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
PROCESS.
ALL THE EVIDENCE WILL BE

950
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
PROCESSED.

951
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
WE'LL CONTINUE TO ANALYZE EVERY

952
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
SINGLE PIECE, AND, AGAIN, I

953
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
CANNOT DETAIL THE CONTENT OF ANY

954
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
EVIDENCE OR EVEN WHAT THAT

955
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
EVIDENCE IS FOR PUBLIC

956
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
CONSUMPTION.
I WANT TO RESTATE AGAIN, THANK

957
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
YOU FOR HELPING US IN THIS, BUT

958
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
ANY THREATS, ANY INFORMATION

959
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
INTENDED TO MISLEAD

960
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
INVESTIGATORS IN THIS CASE WILL,

961
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
IN FACT, BE COMPLETELY AND

962
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED, AND IF

963
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
APPROPRIATE, PROSECUTED IF

964
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
ANYONE ATTEMPTS TO THREATEN OR

965
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
MISLEAD THIS INVESTIGATION.

966
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
AS YOU KNOW, THERE WERE A COUPLE

967
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
YESTERDAY, AND THOSE TOO ARE

968
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
ACTIVE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS.

969
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
TEAMS OF STATE POLICE DETECTIVES

970
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
AND NEWTOWN DETECTIVES HAVE BEEN

971
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
ASSIGNED TO INVESTIGATE THOSE AS

972
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
ANCILLARY CRIMINAL CASES, IF YOU

973
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
WILL.
THE CRISIS TEAMS ARE STILL IN

974
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
PLACE.
I WANT TO GIVE YOU THAT PHONE

975
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
NUMBER AGAIN.

976
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN THE

977
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
TOWN, AND THIS PHONE LINE IS

978
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
OPEN TO ANYONE, ANYONE WHO NEEDS

979
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
TO DISCUSS ANYTHING OR NEEDS

980
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
SUPPORT FROM PROFESSIONALS.

981
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
THEY'RE STAFFING THIS LINE FROM

982
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
THE HOSPITAL.

983
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
THE NUMBER IS 203-270-4283.

984
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
AT THIS TIME, I WILL ENTERTAIN

985
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
SOME QUESTIONS.

986
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
AGAIN, PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT

987
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS THAT WE

988
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
JUST CANNOT GO DOWN AT THIS

989
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
POINT IN TIME.

990
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
YES, MA'AM?

991
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
>> RICHFIELD SCHOOLS ARE

992
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
CURRENTLY UNDER LOCKDOWN.

993
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
IS IT ALL RELATED TO SANDY HOOK?

994
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
>> WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL ADDRESS

995
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
THAT.
I'M AWARE OF THAT SITUATION IN

996
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
THE TOWN OF RICHFIELD.

997
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT IS
HANDLING THAT SITUATION.

998
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
THERE'S A REPORT OF A SUSPICIOUS

999
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
PERSON THAT MAY, IN FACT, BE

1000
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
ARMED.
WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE

1001
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
SITUATION IS.

1002
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
WE SENT APPROPRIATE PERSONNEL IN

1003
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
THAT DIRECTION TO ASSIST

1004
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
RICHFIELD, BUT RICHFIELD IS

1005
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
HANDLING THAT SITUATION.

1006
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
THERE'S BEEN NO UPDATES OTHER

1007
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
THAN THAT.
>> DO THE SCHOOLS FEEL SAFE

1008
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
RIGHT NOW?

1009
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
>> THE SCHOOLS, AGAIN, ARE SAFE

1010
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
WITH THE RIDGEFIELD OFFICERS AND

1011
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
RIDGEFIELD POLICE DEPARTMENT
WITH THAT.

1012
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
>> YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE

1013
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
INTERVIEWING EVERY WITNESS.

1014
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
OBVIOUSLY, THAT INCLUDES
CHILDREN.

1015
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW YOU'RE

1016
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
HANDLING THAT?
>> I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO

1017
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
DETAIL.
IT'S A VERY, VERY TENDER, TENDER

1018
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
ISSUE.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT ANY

1019
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
INTERVIEWS WITH ANY CHILDREN

1020
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
WILL BE DONE WITH PROFESSIONALS,

1021
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
WITH PARENTS, AND WITH

1022
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
INVESTIGATORS, AS APPROPRIATE.

1023
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
THE INVESTIGATORS WILL DETERMINE

1024
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
HOW, WHEN, WHERE, AND WHY WE'LL

1025
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
DO THIS.

1026
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
AGAIN, UNDERSTAND WE WILL HANDLE

1027
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
THAT EXTREMELY DELICATELY WHEN

1028
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
THE TIME ARISES.

1029
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
>> LIEUTENANT, HAVE YOU HAD ANY

1030
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
MEDICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH

1031
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
PROFESSIONALS COME FORWARD TO

1032
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
SAY WHETHER THEY WERE TREATING

1033
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
ADAM LANZA?

1034
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
IF THERE ARE ANY OUT THERE WITH

1035
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
SUCH INFORMATION, WOULD YOU ASK

1036
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
THEM TO COME FORWARD?

1037
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
>> CERTAINLY, WE WOULD ENCOURAGE

1038
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
ANYONE WITH ANY INFORMATION TO

1039
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
COME FORWARD THAT CAN ASSIST US

1040
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
IN THIS INVESTIGATION.
WHEN I TALKED ABOUT THE WEAPONRY

1041
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
AND THE HISTORICAL ANALYSIS, ALL

1042
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
THE WEAPONRY INVOLVED, THE SAME

1043
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
THING HOLDS TRUE WITH THE

1044
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
SUSPECT.

1045
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
WE WILL GO BACK TO THE DATE OF

1046
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
BIRTH.

1047
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
WE WILL CONTINUE ON THROUGH.

1048
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
WE WILL ANSWER EVERY SINGLE

1049
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
QUESTION DETERMINING ANY KIND OF

1050
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
MEDICAL CONDITION, ANY KIND OF

1051
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
ISSUE WHATSOEVER THAT MAY HAVE

1052
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
BEEN INVOLVED IN.

1053
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISCUSS

1054
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
MEDICAL CONTENT.

1055
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISCUSS

1056
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
ANY OF THE INFORMATION SO FAR

1057
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
UNCOUGHED, BU

1058
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
UNCOVERED, BUT SUFFICE IT TO

1059
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
SAY, I WANT TO SAY WE WILL COVER

1060
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
EVERY SINGLE FACET.

1061
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
>> THERE ARE REPORTS THAT LAW

1062
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
ENFORCEMENT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT

1063
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
ADAM LANZA PREVIOUS TO THIS.

1064
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
DO YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT INTO

1065
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
THAT?

1066
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
>> NO.
WE'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH

1067
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
NEWTOWN POLICE, AND THERE WAS NO

1068
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
PREVIOUS CONTACT OR CONCERNS

1069
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
PRIOR TO THIS TRAGIC EVENT.

1070
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
YES, SIR.
>> CAN YOU TELL US MORE DETAIL

1071
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
ON HOW HE PROCEEDED TO GET IN

1072
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
THE SCHOOL AND WHAT HE DID ONCE

1073
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
INSIDE.

1074
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
>> I CAN'T DO THAT.
IT'S TOO DIFFICULT TO DISCUSS.

1075
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU,

1076
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
IT'S TOO DIFFICULT TO DISCUSS.

1077
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I CAN TELL YOU, AS I'VE BEEN

1078
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
TELLING YOU, THE SUSPECT FORCED

1079
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
HIS WAY INTO THE SCHOOL BEFORE

1080
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
AND AS HE BEGAN TO TAKE HUMAN

1081
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
LIFE THEREIN.
I SIMPLY DON'T WANT TO -- AND

1082
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR US TO

1083
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
GO ANY FURTHER WITH THAT.

1084
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
YES, MA'AM.

1085
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
>> ARE OFFICERS STILL TALKING TO

1086
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
GUN SHOPS AND GUN RANGES TO FIND

1087
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
OUT INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER

1088
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
LANZA TRIED TO POSSESS OTHER

1089
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
FIREARMS.

1090
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
>> GOOD QUESTION.

1091
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
WE'RE NOT ONLY CHECKING THE

1092
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
WEAPONRY, BUT ATF IS WORKING

1093
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
WITH US.

1094
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
NEWTOWN IS WORKING WITH US.

1095
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
OTHER AGENCIES WORKING WITH US

1096
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
SEARCHING EVERY DATABASE, EVERY

1097
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
RECORD, SEARCHING EVERYTHING WE

1098
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
CAN POSSIBLY UNCOVER.

1099
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
AGAIN, IF ANYONE HAD ANY CONTACT

1100
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000

YES, SIR?

1104
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
>> HAS ANY PROGRESS BEEN MADE IN

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000

INFORMATION FROM THE COMPUTERS

1107
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000

1108
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000

00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
NONSTOP EXAMINING ANY EVIDENCE

THAT WAS SEIZED AT ANY LOCATION,

1113
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
LITERALLY.

1114
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
WHETHER IT BE CELL PHONES,

1115
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
COMPUTERS.
AND I'M NOT NAMING ANYTHING THAT

1116
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
WAS SEIZED.

1117
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I'M SAYING ALL THAT ELECTRONIC

1118
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
EVIDENCE WILL, IN FACT, BE

1119
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
ANALYZED.

1120
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
WE CERTAINLY WILL DISSECT IT, IF

1121
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
YOU WILL.

1122
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
>> DID ADAM LEAVE ANY EVIDENCE

1123
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
AT THE HOME?

1124
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
>> I CAN'T DISCUSS THE EVIDENCE.

1125
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
>> IS THERE A SEPARATE SURVIVOR?

1126
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
REPORTS THAT THERE ARE TWO

1127
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
SURVIVORS.
>> YES, THERE ARE TWO ADULTS

1128
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
THAT WERE INJURED IN THE
FACILITY, IN THE SCHOOL, THAT

1129
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
SUFFERED GUNSHOT WOUNDS AND ARE

1130
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
RECOVERING.

1131
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
>> WHY DID HE HAVE HIS BROTHER'S

1132
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I.D.?

1133
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION

1134
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
ABOUT WHAT HE WAS CARRYING AT

1135
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
ALL.

1136
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
>> NO INFORMATION ABOUT HOW HE

1137
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
GOT HIS BROTHER'S I.D.?

1138
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
>> NO INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT HE

1139
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
WAS CARRYING AT ALL.

1140
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
>> WAS THERE A SURVEILLANCE

1141
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
SYSTEM INSIDE THAT SCHOOL?

1142
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT.

1143
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION.

1144
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
>> ABOUT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN WITH

1145
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
THE SCHOOL AFTER IT'S NO LONGER

1146
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
A CRIME SCENE?

1147
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
>> THAT WILL A TOWN DECISION,

1148
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
THE TOWN LEADERS.

1149
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
AGAIN, WE ARE POSSESSING THAT

1150
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
SCHOOL.
WE ARE HOLDING THAT SCHOOL AS A

1151
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
CRIME SCENE INDEFINITELY.

1152
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
AND I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU WHAT

1153
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
THAT MEANS.

1154
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THAT WILL

1155
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
BE.
I'M SUSPECTING MONTHS.

1156
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
AT THAT TIME, IT'S UP TO THE

1157
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
TOWN OFFICIALS TO DETERMINE

1158
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
EXACTLY WHAT'S APPROPRIATE WITH

1159
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
THAT FACILITY AND WITH THAT

1160
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
BUILDING.
YES, SIR?
>> CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW THE

1161
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
TWO SURVIVORS ARE HELPING AT ALL

1162
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
IF IN THIS INVESTIGATION?

1163
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
>> WE PROVIDED THE SURVIVORS

1164
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
WITH THE SAME CONDUIT WE

1165
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
PROVIDED ALL THE OTHER VICTIMS

1166
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
IN THIS CASE, AND THAT IS LAW

1167
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
ENFORCEMENT ESCORT, IF YOU WILL.

1168
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
OUR INVESTIGATORS WILL, IN FACT,

1169
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
SPEAK WITH THEM WHEN IT'S

1170
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE, AND

1171
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
CERTAINLY THEY WILL SHED A GREAT

1172
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
DEAL OF LIGHT ON THE FACTS AND

1173
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS TRAGIC

1174
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
INVESTIGATION THAT WE'RE

1175
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
UNDERTAKING.
>> LIEUTENANT, WOULD YOU TALK

1176
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

1177
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
AMMUNITION THAT HE HAD WITH HIM.

1178
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
YOU ALLUDED TO THAT YESTERDAY.

1179
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
THE GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT THAT

1180
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
YESTERDAY AS WELL.

1181
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
DO YOU NOW BELIEVE THAT HE HAD

1182
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
MUCH WIDER INTENTIONS INSIDE

1183
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
THAT SCHOOL THAT WERE THWARTED

1184
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
BECAUSE OF THE EFFORTS OF LAW

1185
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
ENFORCEMENT?
>> I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS

1186
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
THAT I CAN'T SPECULATE WHAT

1187
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
WOULD HAVE OCCURRED.

1188
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
THAT WOULD BE WRONG ON MY PART.

1189
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FACULTY,

1190
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
STAFF IN THAT SCHOOL DID

1191
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
EVERYTHING THAT THEY POSSIBLY

1192
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
COULD TO PROTECT THOSE CHILDREN.

1193
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FIRST

1194
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
RESPONDERS THAT GOT TO THAT

1195
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
SCENE WITH THE ACTIVE SHOOTER

1196
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
TEAM ENTERED THAT SCHOOL AND

1197
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
SAVED MANY HUMAN LIVES, AND I

1198
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
CAN TELL YOU IT BROKE OUR HEARTS

1199
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
WE COULDN'T SAVE THEM ALL.

1200
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
SO QUITE FRANKLY, THERE ARE THE

1201
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
VICTIMS, THE FAMILIES IN THIS

1202
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
SITUATION THAT REALLY ARE A

1203
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
FOCUS OF OUR ATTENTION RIGHT

1204
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
NOW.

1205
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
WE'LL LEAVE THAT THERE, PLEASE.

1206
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
>> IS THERE ANY ADDED POLICE

1207
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
PRESENCE IN OTHER SCHOOLS AROUND

1208
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
THIS STATE.

1209
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
>> THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE UNDER

1210
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
THE LEADERSHIP OF THE GOVERNOR

1211
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
AND THE EDUCATIONAL COMMISSIONER

1212
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
AND LAW, ALL THE LOCAL

1213
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
OFFICIALS.

1214
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
MANY, MANY SCHOOLS ARE SHOWING

1215
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT AND
SECURITY, AND I MUST STATE VERY

1216
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
EMPHATICALLY, VERY EMPHATICALLY,

1217
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
THAT IT IS NOT FUNNY.
IT IS NOT A JOKE.

1218
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR ANYONE

1219
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
TO MAKE ANY KIND OF INNER THREAT

1220
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
OR MAKE ANY STATEMENT RELATIVE

1221
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
TO THE SECURITY AND THE

1222
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS, RESPECT

1223
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
WHAT'S OCCURRED HERE.

1224
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I WOULD ASK PEOPLE TO RESPECT

1225
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
WHAT'S OCCURRED HERE, AND

1226
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
CERTAINLY WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR

1227
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
BEST TO ENSURE SECURITY

1228
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
STATEWIDE.
LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL DO SO AS

1229
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
WELL AS THE PROFESSIONALS AT

1230
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
EACH AND EVERY EDUCATIONAL

1231
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
INSTITUTION IN CONNECTICUT.

1232
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO NOW IS TELL

1233
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
YOU THAT I DON'T WANT TO KEEP

1234
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
COMING.

1235
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
WE'LL COME HERE EVERY DAY.

1236
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
LIEUTENANT AND I COME HERE EVERY

1237
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
DAY IF IT'S NECESSARY.

1238
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I DON'T WANT TO COME AND JUST

1239
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
TELL YOU EVERYTHING'S UNDER

1240
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
INVESTIGATION.

1241
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
OUR NEXT BRIEFING WE'LL HAVE

1242
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
WILL PROBABLY BE ABOUT 12:00

1243
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
NOON TODAY, JUST BEFORE 12:00

1244
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
NOON IF WE CAN GET HERE TO BRING

1245
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
YOU UP TO DATE WITH ANYTHING WE

1246
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
HAVE.

1247
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
BUT WE'RE GOING TO -- WE'RE

1248
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
GOING TO START SCALING BACK THE

1249
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
BRIEFINGS, AND WE'LL PUT

1250
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
EVERYTHING THAT'S NECESSARY

1251
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
APPLICABLE TO THIS INVESTIGATION

1252
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
ON OUR WEBSITE.

1253
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
WE TRULY BELIEVE THAT KEEPING

1254
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
YOU HERE IS PROBABLY SOMEWHAT

1255
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.
I WOULD RESTATE AGAIN, PLEASE,

1256
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
THE FAMILIES HAVE REQUESTED

1257
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
PRIVACY DURING THE SERVICES, AND

1258
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I KNOW YOU FOLKS HAVE BEEN

1259
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
GREAT.

1260
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I WOULD ASK YOU TO CONTINUE TO

1261
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
DO SO.

1262
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
WE'LL SEE YOU JUST BEFORE NOON.
THANK YOU.

1263
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000

1264
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000

GRASPING A NUMBER OUT OF THE SKY

LITERALLY.

YOU HEARD THAT HE SAID THERE'S

1278
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
INCREASED SECURITY IN PART

1285
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
OUR QUESTION.

1286
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
HOW DO WE PREVENT ANOTHER

1287
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000

FRONT AND CENTER, HOW DO WE

1288
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
PROTECT OUR CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS

1289
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
THESE DAYS?
SO LET'S BRING BACK OUR

1290
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
CONTRIBUTORS.

1291
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
WILL CAIN, L.Z. GRAN DER SODERS

1292
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
DON LEMON.

1293
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
L.Z., YOU HAD A VERY TOUCHING

1294
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
COLUMN ABOUT HOW PARENTS CAN

1295
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
KEEP THEIR CHILDREN SAFE.

1296
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
WHAT CONCLUSION DID YOU COME TO?

1297
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
>> SADLY, THE CONCLUSION I CAME

1298
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
TO AS A PARENT WAS IT'S

1299
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ENSURE

1300
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
THAT MY SON OR ANYONE'S CHILD

1301
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
WILL BE PROTECTED FROM ANY HARM

1302
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
THAT CAN HAPPEN ONCE THEY'RE OUT

1303
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
OF OUR SIGHTS.

1304
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
AS I WAS DROPPING MY SON OFF

1305
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
THIS MORNING, I WATCHED HIM WALK

1306
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
ALL THE WAY INTO THE BUILDING,

1307
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
AND IT LITERALLY TOOK EVERY

1308
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
EFFORT IN ME NOT TO GET OUT OF

1309
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
THE CAR AND WALK HIM PERSONALLY

1310
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
TO THE BUILDING, AND HE'S 16

1311
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
YEARS OLD.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING

1312
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
LIKE THIS, YOU SEE THE LITTLE

1313
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
LIVES THAT WERE TAKEN, I DON'T

1314
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
KNOW HOW ANY PARENT CAN HAVE

1315
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
PEACE WHEN THEIR CHILD IS NOT

1316
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
NEAR THEM.

1317
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
SO IT'S VERY, VERY DISTRESSING,

1318
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
AND WE'RE REALLY HOPING THAT THE

1319
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE BEGUN TO

1320
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
HAPPEN THIS WEEKEND DON'T END

1321
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
ONCE ALL THE FUNERALS HAVE BEEN

1322
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
HELD.

1323
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
THAT TRUE LEGISLATIVE POWER

1324
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
COMES FROM THIS.
>> WE'LL SEE.

1325
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
WILL, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A

1326
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
TOUGH QUESTION.

1327
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I KNOW AT LEAST TWO SCHOOL

1328
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
DISTRICTS IN PITTSBURGH,

1329
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
PENNSYLVANIA, HAVE GIVEN

1330
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
SECURITY OFFICERS IN SCHOOLS

1331
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
PERMISSION TO CARRY GUNS TODAY.

1332
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
IS THAT THE ANSWER?

1333
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
IS THAT HOW WE KEEP KIDS SAFE?

1334
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
DO WE ARM SCHOOL SECURITY

1335
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
GUARDS?

1336
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
DO WE ARM THE PRINCIPALS?

1337
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
>> CAROL, THAT DOESN'T -- FROM A

1338
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
COMMON SENSE, INSTINCTUAL LEVEL,

1339
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
NO, THAT DOESN'T RING AS

1340
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
APPROPRIATE TO ME.

1341
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
HERE'S THE DEAL.

1342
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
JUST LIKE L.Z., I DROPPED MY SON

1343
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
OFF AT SCHOOL THIS MORNING.

1344
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
MY SON IS 5 YEARS OLD.

1345
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
HE'S RIGHT IN THIS AGE RANGE.

1346
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE THE

1347
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
EMOTION OF THIS MOMENT.

1348
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK AT THIS

1349
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
IN STRICTLY RATIONAL TERMS.

1350
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
THAT BEING SAID, I THINK THAT

1351
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
OUR FOCUS ON GUNS, IT JUST --

1352
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
IT'S TOO NARROW.

1353
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
IT DOESN'T STAND UP TO CRITICAL

1354
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
THOUGHT.
HERE'S THE DEAL, CAROL.

1355
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
GUN VIOLENCE IS, QUITE HONESTLY,

1356
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
IT'S DOWN FROM A PEAK IN THE

1357
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
1990s.

1358
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
AND YET THESE MASS KILLINGS ARE

1359
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
UP.

1360
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
SIX OF THE DEADLIEST 12 HAVE

1361
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
HAPPENED SINCE 2007.

1362
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
SO IF GUNS ARE SOMEWHAT

1363
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
CONSTANT, WHAT IS THE

1364
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
DETERMINING FACTOR?

1365
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
WHAT HAS CHANGED?

1366
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
WE MUST FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

1367
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH, ANALYZE

1368
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
MENTAL HEALTH.

1369
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED IN OUR

1370
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
COUNTRY IN THE LAST 40 YEARS.

1371
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
THE PROCESS OF

1372
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
DEINSTITUTIONALIZING MENTAL

1373
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
HEALTH OR THE RISE IN

1374
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS.

1375
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
THIS SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY THING

1376
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
THAT I CAN PINPOINT NOW THAT IS

1377
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
THE DELINEATING FACTOR, AND

1378
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
THAT'S WHERE WE MUST FOCUS.

1379
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
>> LET'S HEAD TO NEWTOWN,

1380
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
CONNECTICUT, AND DON LEMON, WHAT

1381
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
ARE PEOPLE THERE SAYING?

1382
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
>> LET ME -- LISTEN, FOR THE

1383
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
PAST THREE DAYS, I HAVE BEEN ON

1384
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
THE VERGE OF TEARS EVERY SECOND,

1385
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE HERE HAVE

1386
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
BEEN CRYING 24 HOURS STRAIGHT.

1387
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
YES, WE NEED TO ADDRESS MENTAL

1388
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
HEALTH, BUT MENTAL HEALTH IN

1389
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE -- LET'S

1390
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
NOT GET IT TWISTED -- IS A

1391
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
SECONDARY ISSUE.
IF SOMEONE WHO HAS A MENTAL

1392
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
ISSUE DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO

1393
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
GUNS THAT SHOULD ONLY BE

1394
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
AVAILABLE IN WAR ZONES, WE WOULD

1395
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
NOT BE DEALING WITH THIS.

1396
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
WHO NEEDS A BULLET PIERCING,

1397
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
ARMOR PIERCING BULLET TO GO

1398
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000

WHO NEEDS AN ASSAULT RIFLE TO GO

1399
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
HUNTING?
YOU CAN'T EVEN USE THE PREY THAT

1400
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
YOU KILL WITH AN ASSAULT RIFLE

1401
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
IF YOU INDEED DO IT.

1402
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
NO ONE NEEDS AN ASSAULT RIFLE TO

1403
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
GO OUT AND SHOOT A DEER.
NO ONE NEEDS AN ASSAULT RIFLE

1404
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
THAT'S CAPABLE OF SHOOTING 10,

1405
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
20, 30 ROUNDS OFF AT A TIME TO

1406
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
SHOOT A DUCK OR TO SHOOT QUAIL.

1407
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE.

1408
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
THE FIRST THING THAT WE NEED TO

1409
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
DO, ACCORDING TO EVERYONE WHO IS

1410
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
HERE, EVEN GUN ENTHUSIASTS, IS

1411
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH

1412
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
ASSAULT RIFLES.

1413
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
WHY SHOULD GUNS THAT SHOULD ONLY

1414
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
BE AVAILABLE IN WAR ZONES, WHY

1415
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
ARE THEY AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO

1416
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
ARE MENTALLY HEALTHY AND PEOPLE

1417
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
WHO ARE NOT MENTALLY HEALTHY?

1418
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO

1419
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
DEAL WITH.
SO TO SAY THAT GUN VIOLENCE IS

1420
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
DOWN DOES NOT MAKE SENSE.

1421
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
TO ME, IT'S INSULTING TO

1422
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
EVERYONE WHO LOST A LOVED ONE

1423
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
HERE AND WHO WAS DEALING WITH

1424
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
THAT.
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF GUN

1425
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
VIOLENCE IS DOWN.

1426

CHALLENGED IN SOME WAY IS DEAD.

1431

1433
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
MENTAL HEALTH, YES.

1434
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000

TORN APART.

1638
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
THAT ALL ACROSS THIS LAND OF

1639
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,000
OURS, WE HAVE WEPT WITH YOU.

1640
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
WE PULLED OUR CHILDREN TIGHT.

1641
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
AND YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHATEVER

1642
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
MEASURE OF COMFORT WE CAN

1643
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
PROVIDE, WE WILL PROVIDE.

1644
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
WHATEVER PORTION OF SADNESS THAT

1645
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU TO EASE

1646
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,000
THIS HEAVY LOAD, WE WILL GLADLY

1647
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
BEAR IT.

1648
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
NEWTOWN, YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

1649
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
>> Reporter: WE ARE GOING TO BE

1650
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
BACK HERE IN NEWTOWN IN JUST A

1651
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
FEW MINUTES.

1652
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
FOR NOW, I'M GOING TO HAND IT

1653
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
BACK OVER TO CAROL WHO IS IN

1654
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
ATLANTA.
I WATCHED IT HERE IN A TAVERN

1655
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
NOT A DRY EYE IN THE HOUSE.

1656
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
IT WAS SUCH A MOVING MEMORIAL

1657
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
LAST NIGHT.
>> IT REALLY WAS.

1658
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT DOING

1659
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
SOMETHING.
HE SORT OF INTIMATED GUN CONTROL

1660
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
WAS PART OF THAT SOMETHING.

1661
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
HOW DID YOU TAKE THAT, DON?

1662
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
>> Reporter: I THINK HE HAD SOME

1663
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
VERY STRONG LANGUAGE ON GUN

1664
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
LAWS.

1665
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I DON'T KNOW IF GUN CONTROL IS

1666
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
THE RIGHT THING -- I THINK WHAT

1667
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING AND MOST

1668
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
PEOPLE ARE SAYING, IT IS NOT

1669
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
ABOUT TAKING AWAY ANYONE'S

1670
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

1671
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
IT IS ABOUT HAVING A SENSIBLE,

1672
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
NON-POLITICIZED CONVERSATION

1673
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
ABOUT OUR GUN LAWS, TAKINGING A

1674
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
SECOND LOOK AT THEM.

1675
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE AT

1676
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
THIS POINT.
>> OKAY.

1677
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
DON, AFTER WHAT HAPPENED IN

1678
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
NEWTOWN, SCHOOLS ARE STRUGGLING

1679
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
WITH GUN CONTROL.

1680
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
GUNS IN GENERAL AND HOW TO KEEP

1681
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
KIDS SAFE.

1682
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
ONE WAY ARMED SCHOOL SECURITY

1683
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
GUARDS.

1684
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
ACCORDING TO THE PITTSBURGH

1685
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
GAZETTE, AT LEAST WOULD

1686
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
PITTSBURGH AREA SCHOOL DISTRICTS

1687
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
WILL ALLOW ARMED GUARDS TO

1688
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
PATROL THEIR SCHOOLS.

1689
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
THE SUPERINTENDENT TOLD THE

1690
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
PAPER, QUOTE, IT WAS OUR INTENT

1691
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
TO DO THIS ANYWAY.

1692
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
THE MUST HAVE TOWN SHOOTING

1693
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
CAUSED US TO THINK ABOUT IT AND

1694
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
WORK OVER THE WEEKEND TO

1695
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
EXPEDITE THAT PROCESS.

1696
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
GUN ADVOCATES ARE ALSO FOR IT.

1697
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
>> I WISH TO GOD SHE HAD AN M-4

1698
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
IN HER OFFICE LOCKED UP SO WHEN

1699
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
SHE HEARD GUNFIRE PULLED IT OUT

1700
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
AND DIDN'T HAVE TO LUNG

1701
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
HEROICALLY WITH NOTHING IN HER

1702
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
HANDS BUT TAKES HIM OUT.

1703
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
>> HE MENTIONED AN M-4.

1704
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
IF YOU ARE WONDERING WHAT AN M-4

1705
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
IS, HERE IS A PICTURE OF IT.

1706
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
AN ASSAULT RIFLE USED BY THE

1707
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
U.S. MILITARY.

1708
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
JOINING US NOW IS CONNECTICUT

1709
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
SENATOR JOE LIEBERMAN.

1710
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
GOOD MORNING, SENATOR.

1711
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
>> GOOD MORNING, CAROL.

1712
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
>> I'M JUST GOING CUT RIGHT TO

1713
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
THE CHASE.
IS THAT THE ANSWER, SENATOR,

1714
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
MORE GUNS?

1715
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS.

1716
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
OBVIOUSLY SECURITY AT SCHOOL

1717
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
BUILDINGS IS IMPORTANT.

1718
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
BUT THIS -- AS THE PRESIDENT

1719
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
SAID, VERY ELOQUENTLY LAST NIGHT

1720
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
IS A VERY COMPLICATED PROBLEM.

1721
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
BUT THE FACT THAT IT IS

1722
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
COMPLICATED DOESN'T MEAN WE

1723
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
CAN'T DOING IN ABOUT IT AND I

1724
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT ISSUED A

1725
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
CALL TO NATIONAL ACTION PRECEDED

1726
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
BY DISCUSSION WHEN HE SAID THAT

1727
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
IT IS TIME FOR THESE TRAGEDIES

1728
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
TO END.
I MEAN, CLEARLY PART OF IT HAS

1729
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
TO BE -- TO MAKE IT HARDER TO --

1730
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
FOR PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE

1731
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
GUNS TO HAVE THEM.

1732
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
AND TO KEEP SOME GUNS THAT ARE

1733
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
MILITARY GUNS AND NOT HUNTING OR

1734
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
SPORTS GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF

1735
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
MOST PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY.

1736
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
BUT IT IS MORE THAN IN A.

1737
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
IT IS ABOUT BALANCE AND THE

1738
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
CULTURE.

1739
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

1740
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
IT IS ABOUT SPOTTING THESE KIDS

1741
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
WHO FIT THE PROFILE, TROUBLED

1742
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
YOUNG MEN, WHO EVERYBODY IN

1743
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
HINDSIGHT SAYS I SHOULD HAVE

1744
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
NOTICED THIS.
HOW WE MAKE SURE WE NOTICE IT

1745
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
BEFORE THEY STRIKE AND GET THEM

1746
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
HELP SO THAT -- SO NEVER STRIKE

1747
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
AND HURT ANYBODY.

1748
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
>> SENATOR, I THINK A LOT OF

1749
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
PEOPLE OUT WILL THINK, YOU KNOW,

1750
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
THESE TRAGEDIES HAPPEN.

1751
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
WE HEAR BIG TALK FROM

1752
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
POLITICIANS, WHAT THEY DON'T --

1753
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
THEY DON'T HAVE THE POLITICAL

1754
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
WILL OR COURAGE TO REALLY CHANGE

1755
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
THINGS.

1756
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
>> I DON'T BLAME PEOPLE FOR

1757
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
THINKING THAT BECAUSE -- THAT'S

1758
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
THE RECORD.

1759
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
YOU KNOW.
THE LAST THING WE REALLY ADOPTED

1760
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
A LAW ON GUNS, FOR INSTANCE, WAS

1761
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
IN 1993 OR '94, THE BRADY ACT

1762
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
NAMED AFTER JIM BRADY, PRESIDENT

1763
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
REAGAN'S PRESS SECRETARY, WHO
WAS DISABLED BY GUNFIRE WHEN

1764
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
HINCKLEY RIDE TO KILL PRESIDENT

1765
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
REAGAN.
THAT TOOK SEVEN YEARS TO PASS.

1766
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
WE HAD AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN

1767
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
THAT PASSED AT ABOUT THAT TIME,

1768
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
HAD A TEN-YEAR LIFE AS A STATUTE

1769
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
AND NOT A CONSENSUS TO

1770
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
REAUTHORIZE IT.

1771
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
THAT'S WHY I THINK WHAT THE

1772
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
PRESIDENT SAID LAST NIGHT IS SO

1773
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK HE WAS

1774
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
SAYING HE WANTS -- HE'S

1775
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
COMMITTED TO DOING SOMETHING

1776
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
ABOUT VIOLENCE IN OUR SOCIETY

1777
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
AND IN THIS SECOND TERM.

1778
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
IT IS WHY I'M PROPOSING A

1779
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
COMMISSION TO MAKE -- ONCE YOU

1780
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
APPOINTED COMMISSION, THEY HOLD

1781
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,000
HEARINGS.
THEY TALK TO PEOPLE.

1782
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
EVENTUALLY THEY PRODUCE A REPORT
WITH RECOMMENDATIONS.

1783
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
THAT'S SOME SMALL GUARANTEE WE

1784
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
WON'T WALK AWAY FROM THIS.

1785
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
>> I THINK WHEN PEOPLE LISTEN TO

1786
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
THAT AND SAY THAT'S GREAT, YOU

1787
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
WANT TO POINT A COMMISSION AND

1788
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS.

1789
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
OFTENTIMES, NOTHING COMES OF IT.

1790
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE NRA

1791
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
BECAUSE THE NRA REMAINED SILENT

1792
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
ON THIS ISSUE.

1793
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
WE HAVEN'T HEARD WORD ONE.

1794
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
FACEBOOK PAGE IS DOWN.

1795
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

1796
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
WHY ISN'T THE NRA COMING OUT AND

1797
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
STANDING UP FOR ITSELF WHEN SO

1798
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
MANY OUT THERE ARE BLAMING THE

1799
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
NRA FOR WHAT HAPPENED IN

1800
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT?

1801
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
>> YEAH.

1802
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
WELL, I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY YOU

1803
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
WOULD HAVE TO ASK FOLKS FROM THE

1804
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
NRA.
LET'S JUST HOPE IT IS OUT OF

1805
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
RESPECT FOR THIS TRAGEDY.

1806
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, FROM THE

1807
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
PRESIDENT ON DOWN, WE ALL HAVE

1808
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,000
TO ENGAGE THE NRA AND PEOPLE WE

1809
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
KNOW WHO HAVE GUNS AND WANT TO

1810
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
KEEP THEIR GUNS AND REMIND THEM

1811
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
JUST AS DON LEMON SAID A MOMENT

1812
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
AGO, NONE OF THESE PROPOSALS

1813
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
WILL TAKE GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS

1814
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEM NOW.

1815
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
THIS IS ALL ABOUT TRYING TO

1816
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
LIMIT ACCESS TO GUNS BY PEOPLE

1817
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM.

1818
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
BASED ON THEIR RECORDS.

1819
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
AND TO KEEP MILITARY WEAPONS OFF

1820
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
OF THE COMMERCIAL MARKET.

1821
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
THAT SHOULDN'T INHIBIT ANYBODY'S

1822
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
RIGHT TO HUNT, TARGET SHOOT, OR

1823
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
EVEN TO DEFEND THEMSELVES WITH A

1824
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
GUN.

1825
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I THINK -- THIS MURDER OF 20

1826
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
PURE, INNOCENT CHILDREN IS A

1827
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
TIPPING POINT.

1828
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I'M PROPOSING THIS COMMISSION SO

1829
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
WE DON'T LOSE THE ANGER AND HURT

1830
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
WE HAVE NOW BEFORE WE REALLY GET

1831
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
SOMETHING DONE ABOUT THIS.

1832
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I DON'T WANT THE COMMISSION TO

1833
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
BE AN EXCUSE FOR NOT DOING

1834
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
SOMETHING.

1835
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
IF THE PRESIDENT CAN DO

1836
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
SOMETHING NOW EXECUTIVE ORDER,

1837
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
GOD BLESS HIM.

1838
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
IF CONGRESS CAN GET TOGETHER

1839
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
SOON AND GET SOMETHING DONE, GOD

1840
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
BLESS CONGRESS.

1841
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
BUT --

1842
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
>> EVEN AFTER GABRIELLE

1843
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
GIFFORDS, ONE OF YOUR OWN, WHO

1844
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
IS STILL DAMAGED TO THIS DAY

1845
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
BECAUSE SOMEBODY GOT AHOLD OF A

1846
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
GUN WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE, NOTHING

1847
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
HAPPENED EVEN AFTER THAT.

1848
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
>> YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

1849
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I MEAN, I GO BACK TO COLUMBINE

1850
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
IN 1999.
I ACTUALLY PROPOSED AFTER THAT A

1851
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
COMMISSION VERY SIMILAR TO THIS.

1852
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
JOHN McCAIN AND I AND OTHERS

1853
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
DID.
GOT ADOPT MEDICAL THE SENATE AND

1854
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
WAS DROPPED IN A CONFERENCE

1855
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
COMMITTEE.
NEVER EVEN CONVENED.

1856
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
BUT WE HAVE -- ALL GOT TO BE

1857
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
ANGRY.

1858
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
THIS IS NOT US AND THEM.

1859
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
US AGAINST THE NRA OR US AGAINST

1860
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.

1861
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
THIS IS ALL OF US.

1862
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
THIS IS A QUESTION OF HOW WE ALL

1863
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
PROTECT OURSELVES FROM WANTON

1864
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
VIOLENCE AND MOST FUNDAMENTALLY

1865
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
HOW WE PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

1866
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
AGAIN, I WANT TO SAY -- I WAS

1867
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
HEARTENED BY THE PRESIDENT'S

1868
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
WORDS LAST NIGHT.

1869
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
THEY WERE STRONG AND HE WAS

1870
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
MOVED.
I HAPPENED TO BE AT A BILL

1871
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
SIGNING AT THE WHITE HOUSE

1872
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
FRIDAY MORNING WHEN HE FIRST

1873
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
LEARNED ABOUT HOW EXTENSIVE THE

1874
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
SLAUGHTER WAS IN NEWTOWN.

1875
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
HE WAS SO VISIBLY MOVED.

1876
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I THINK HE'S -- HE'S STRUGGLED

1877
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
WITH THIS OVER THE WEEKEND.

1878
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A

1879
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
CENTERPIECE OF HIS SECOND TERM.

1880
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, 12,000

1881
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
PEOPLE KILLED IN THIS COUNTRY

1882
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
EVERY YEAR WITH ILLEGAL GUNS,

1883
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
WOW.
IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT

1884
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
THAT TO REDUCE THAT NUMBER, THAT

1885
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
WILL BE A REMEMBER LEGACY FOR

1886
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND ANYBODY WHO

1887
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
SUPPORTS THESE EFFORTS.

1888
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
>> SENATOR LIEBERMAN, THANK YOU

1889
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
SO MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS

1890
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
MORNING.
>> THANK YOU, CAROL.

1891
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
>> HOW DO WE TALK ABOUT THIS

1892
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
TRAGEDY?

1893
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
DON LEMON WILL JOIN US AGAIN

1894
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
FROM NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1895
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
HI, DON.
>> Reporter: THANK YOU, CAROL.

1896
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS

1897
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
MOVING FORWARD IN THIS TRAGEDY

1898
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
IS HOW TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED

1899
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
TO CHILDREN.
CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR.

1900
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
SANJAY GUPTA JOINS US.

1901
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
YOU ARE A FATHER.

1902
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I'M AN UNCLE, GREAT UNCLE.

1903
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I CAN'T EVEN -- I HAVE BEEN ON

1904
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
THE VERGE OF TEARS ALMOST EVERY

1905
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
MINUTE HERE.
AS A PEAR, I HEARD YOU

1906
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
EXPLAINING HOW YOU TALKED TO

1907
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
YOUR GIRLS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE

1908
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
THEY ARE ASKING.
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS TO YOUR

1909
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
KIDS?

1910
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
>> YEAH.
I WAS SKYPING.

1911
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I WAS HERE WITH YOU.

1912
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
YOU KNOW.
AND -- YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE

1913
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
FIRST QUESTIONS, JUST INSIDE MY

1914
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
7IER OLD ASKED, SHE IMMEDIATELY

1915
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
ASKED FOR THE NAMES.

1916
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
NAMES OF THE CHILDREN.

1917
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING

1918
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT HUMANIZING

1919
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
AND KIDS, THEY JUST DO THAT

1920
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
INSTINCTIVELY.
WE OBVIOUSLY ARE TRYING TO PUT

1921
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
THE
THESE THINGS IN CONTEXT FOR

1922
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
PEOPLE.
THESE ARE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS.

1923
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE LOSS OF

1924
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
INNOCENCE.
YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST.

1925
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
IN MEDICINE WE SAY YOU CHECK

1926
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
YOUR OWN PULSE BEFORE GOING IN

1927
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
TO TREAT A PATIENT SOMETIMES.

1928
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
HERE CHECK YOUR OWN FEELINGS TO

1929
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
SOME EXTENT.

1930
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
YOU DON'T WANT TO OVERTALK TO

1931
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
THE CHILD AND FRIGHTEN THEM MORE

1932
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
THAN NECESSARY.

1933
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
UP WANT TO BE HONEST.

1934
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
QUESTION WILL COME UP.

1935
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
MY 5-YEAR-OLD WILL ASK TODAY

1936
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO HEAR

1937
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
ABOUT IT.

1938
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
SOCIAL MEDIA ASK OTHERWISE AND

1939
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
SAY IS THEIR SCHOOL SAFE.
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE -- IT DIDN'T

1940
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
HAPPEN IN DADDY'S SCHOOL, IT

1941
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
DIDN'T HAPPEN IN MOMMY'S SCHOOL.

1942
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
THIS OBVIOUSLY HAPPENED.

1943
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
>> Reporter: IS YOUR WIFE

1944
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
LIMITING WATCHING TELEVISION AT

1945
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
HOME?
>> SHE IS.

1946
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
THE TYPES OF STORIES I COVER SHE

1947
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
DOES THAT OFTEN.

1948
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I THINK THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR.

1949
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
>> Reporter: I THINK WHAT

1950
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
PEOPLE -- YOU KNOW, WHAT --

1951
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
OBVIOUSLY THE DEATH OF CHILDREN.

1952
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
BUT IT IS A TIME OF THE YEAR AS

1953
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
WELL.
THESE ARE KIDS WHO IN A WEEK WHO

1954
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS, WHO ARE

1955
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
GOING TO BE -- BOLTING DOWN THE

1956
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
STAIRS TOWARDS THAT CHRISTMAS

1957
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
TREE GOING LOOK AT WHAT SANTA

1958
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
BROUGHT ME.

1959
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
NOW INSTEAD THE PARENTS ARE NOT

1960
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
GOING -- DID I GET MY KID THE

1961
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
RIGHT PRESENT?

1962
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
DID I GO TOO FAR, TOO MUCH?

1963
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
DID I NOT GO ENOUGH.

1964
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
INSTEAD THESE PARENTS ARE

1965
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
PICKING OUT COFFINS.

1966
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS

1967
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
MORNING WHEN I WOKE UP.

1968
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE NOT

1969
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
FIGURING OUT WHAT AM I GOING TO

1970
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
GET LITTLE JANE.
HOW AM I GOING TO GO TO THIS

1971
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
FUNERAL FOR MY SISTER AND

1972
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
BROTHER.

1973
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY,

1974
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
DON.

1975
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, I THINK -- YOU KNOW, I

1976
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO RESPOND

1977
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
TO THAT.
I THINK -- SOME OF THESE THINGS

1978
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
ARE UNPRECEDENTED AND SO

1979
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
HORRIFIC THAT CERTAINLY AS

1980
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
SCIENTISTS WE WANT TO PROVIDE

1981
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
ANSWERS TO THINGS AND -- YOU

1982
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
KNOW, LOOK AT HOW THESE SORTS OF

1983
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
THINGS HAVE BEEN HANDLED IN THE

1984
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
PAST.
I KNOW AFTER OTHER SCHOOL

1985
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
SHOOTINGS, THREE TO FOUR MONTHS

1986
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
LATEST, THE CHILDREN HAD

1987
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
POST-TRAUMATIC DISTRESS.

1988
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
IT EXISTS IN CHILDREN.

1989
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
WE THINK ABOUT IT IN ADULTS.

1990
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
IT CAN BE -- THEY BEHAVE

1991
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
DIFFERENTLY AND MAY REGRESS IN

1992
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
TERMS OF BEHAVIOR, NIECES OR

1993
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
NEPHEWS MAY START TO REGRESS IN

1994
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000

1995
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
SLEEP -- IT SOUNDS SO SIMPLE BUT

1996
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
SLEEP IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT

1997
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
COMPONENT.

1998
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
YOU CAN PREDICT -- SUCH A

1999
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
POWERFUL PREDICTOR OF HOW THEY

2000
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
WILL COPE IS IF THEY ARE GETTING

2001
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
SLEEP.
SOMETHING THE PARENTS CAN DO IS

2002
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
CHECK IN TO MAKE SURE YOUR CHILD

2003
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
IS SLEEPING WELL WITH ALL THAT'S

2004
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
GOING ON.

2005
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
YEAH.
I MEAN, I DON'T -- I DON'T

2006
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
KNOW -- IT IS THE HOLIDAYS, AS

2007
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
YOU SAY.

2008
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I'M SURE SOME OF THE PARENTS

2009
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
ALREADY PURCHASED THE PRESENTS

2010
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
FOR THESE CHILDREN.

2011
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
AND THEY WENT HOME TO SEE THOSE

2012
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
PRESENTS LYING UNDER THE TREE.

2013
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I CAN'T -- YOU KNOW, I MEAN,

FEEL LIKE THEY KNOW YOU AND JUST

2029
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
GIVE YOU A HUG.

2030
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000

01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
ARE GOING THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.

2033
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
THE WORST THING WOULD BE TO

2034
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
SUFFER IN SILENCE OR ISOLATION.

2035
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

2036
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
BUT I'M HERE WITH YOU.

2038
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
IMPORTANT THING.

SENATE AND THE SAME BILL WILL BE

2068
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
INTRODUCED IN THE HOUSE A BILL

TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS.

2070
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
IT WILL BAN THE SALE, TRANSFER,

2071
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
THE IMPORTATION AND THE

2072
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
POSSESSION, NOT RETROACTIVELY,

2073
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
BUT PERSPECTIVELY AND IT WILL

2074
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
BAN THE SAME FOR BIG CLIPS,

2075
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000

2079
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,000
BUT DOES NOT MEAN THAT BILL WILL

PASS.
LET'S BRING IN DANA BASH.

2081
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
I TALKED TO SENATOR LIEBERMAN

2082
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
AND HE SAYS THIS IS THE TIPPING

2083
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
POINT.

2084
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
IN THE COMING WEEKS WE WILL SEE

2085
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
SOME MOVEMENT ON GUN CONTROL.

2086
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?

2087
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
>> YOU KNOW, THE SENTIMENT

2088
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
DEFINITELY SEEMS TO BE
DIFFERENT.

2089
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I MEAN, OVER THE -- HERE'S THE

2090
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
REASON WHY WE HAVEN'T SEEN

2091
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
MOVEMENT ON GUN CONTROL,

2092
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT ON GUN

2093
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
CONTROL, FOR THE PAST DECADE.

2094
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
IT IS BECAUSE DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE

2095
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
BEEN THE PARTY WHO HAVE PUSHED

2096
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
IT MILLION ABOUT 2000, THEY

2097
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
SHIED AWAY FROM IT.
THE REASON IS BECAUSE THEY

2098
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
REALLY FELT THAT THEY WERE HURT

2099
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
POLITICALLY IN RED STATES AND

2100
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
EVEN IN NOT SO RED STATES BY THE

2101
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
BEING SO OVERTLY FOR GUN

2102
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
CONTROL.
AND SO THEY PULLED BACK

2103
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
POLITICALLY.
IT HAS CHANGED IN THE PAST 24 TO

2104
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
48 HOURS.

2105
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
THERE'S MONTH QUESTION.

2106
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000

2108
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
HAS BEEN IN OFFICE FOR DECADES

2109
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
FROM A BLUE STATE, IT IS ALSO

2110
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
OTHERS LIKE JOE MANCHIN.

2111
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
HE HAS AN A-RATE PROSECUTING THE

2112
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
NRA.

2113
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
HE'S VERY MUCH PRO-GUN.

2114
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
HE USED HIMSELF, SHOOTING GUNS,

2115
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
AND IN POLITICAL ADS, WEST

2116
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
VIRGINIA, OBVIOUSLY IS A VERY

2117
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
PRO-GUN STATE.

2118
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
EVEN HE SAYS IT IS TIME TO TALK

2119
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
ABOUT IT.

2120
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYS.

2121
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
>> I JUST CAME WITH MAY FAMILY

2122
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
FROM DEER HUNTING.

2123
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I NEVER HAD MORE THAN THREE

2124
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
SHELLS IN A CLIP.

2125
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T GET MORE

2126
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
THAN ONE SHOT ANYWAY AT A DEER.

2127
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
IT IS COMMON SENSE.

2128
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
IT IS TIME TO MOVE BEYOND

2129
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
RHETORIC.
WE NEED TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A

2130
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
COMMON SENSE DISCUSSION AND MOVE

2131
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
IN A REASONABLE WAY.

2132
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I ASK ALL MY FRIENDS IN THE NRA.

2133
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I HAVE BEEN AN NRA MEMBER AND

2134
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

2135
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
WE NEED TO SIT DOWN AND MOVE

2136
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
THIS DIALOGUE TO A SENSIBLE,

2137
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
REASONABLE APPROACH TO FIXING.

2138
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
IT IS PART OF IT, NOT ALL OF IT

2139
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE ON THE

2140
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
TABLE AND I THINK IT WILL BE.

2141
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000

NOBODY DID ANYTHING TO REINSTATE

2150
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
IT.
HE DID SAY THAT AS A HUNTER, HE

2151

SAID, YOU DON'T NEED 30 ROUNDS

2152
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
TO KILL A DEER.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT

ON --

2174

2175

IN THE WAY IT NORMALLY IS

2179
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
BECAUSE YOU DON'T USUALLY HEAR

2180
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
THINGS UNLESS SOMEONE IS MAKING

2181
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
AN ANNOUNCEMENT.
THERE WERE NOISES THAT DIDN'T

2182
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,000
SOUND CORRECT.
SO THERE WAS NO -- TELLING US IT

2183
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
WAS A DRILL.
WE THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS NOT

2184
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
RIGHT.
WE TOOK THE CHILDREN AND WENT

2185
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
INTO A LOCKDOWN.

2186
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
WE GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE IN THE

2187
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
ROOM.
WE PULLED THE BLINDS DOWN.

2188
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
WE LOCKED THE CLASSROOM DOORS.

2189
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
AND WE COVER THE WINDOW AT THE

2190
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
DOOR.
>> Reporter: THIS IS SOMETHING

2191
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000

WE -- GO TO A SAFE PLACE.

2194
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
AND TYPICALLY WHEN IT IS A DRILL

2195
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
THEY TELL US, OKAY, THEN WE EVEN

2196
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
EXIT THE BUILDING, FOOLING

2197
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
CERTAIN PATH.

2198
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
AND IF THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY WE

2199
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
GO DOWN TO THE SANDY HOOK

2200
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
FIREHOUSE AND GATHER THERE.

2201
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
WHICH IS WHAT WE DID THAT DAY.

2202
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
YOU KNOW, WE KNEW THAT.

2203
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
>> Reporter: YOU SAT THE KIDS

2204
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
DOWN.
>> WE SAT IN THE CUBBY AWAY FROM

2205
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
THE DOOR SO NO ONE COULD SEE US,

2206
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
READ THEM A STORY AND TALKED TO

2207
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
THEM.
THEY KEPT SAYING WE ARE HERE FOR

2208
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
HOW LONG.

2209
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
IT WILL BE ALWAYS LONGER.

2210
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
YOU KNOW.

2211
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
WHEN THEY ARE 5 YOU TELL THEM

2212
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
WHATEVER YOU DO TO GET -- KEEP

2213
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
THEY WILL SAFE AND CALM.

2214
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
>> Reporter: THIS IS WHAT I HAVE

2215
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
BEEN THINKING ABOUT ALL WEEKEND,

2216
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
THOUGH.
THE COURAGE FOR YOU TO BE ABLE

2217
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
TO JUST SIT THERE AND READ A

2218
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
STORY AND KEEP THEM CALM.

2219
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
>> I THINK THE ADRENALINE KICKS

2220
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
IN AND YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE DO.

2221
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
THERE WERE TWO OTHER PEOPLE IN

2222
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
THE ROOM HELPING ME WITH PULLING

2223
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
DOWN THE BLINDS.

2224
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
I WAS FOCUSED ON THE KIDS.

2225
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
JUST KEEPING THEM SAFE AND I'M

2226
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
NOT ABOUT TO TELL THEM I THINK

2227
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
SOMETHING IS VERY BAD OR

2228
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
REMEMBER WRONG.

2229
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
SO WE WAITED AND WAITED.

2230
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
YOU KNOW, IT SEEMED LIKE A VERY

2231
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
LONG TIME AND MAYBE IT WAS 20

2232
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
MINUTES, HALF AN HOUR.

2233
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I'M NOT SURE.

2234
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
THERE WERE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR.

2235
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
IT WAS -- POLICE.

2236
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
SOMEONE TELLING US THAT WE HAD

2237
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
TO LEAVE.

2238
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
DIDN'T WANT TO OPEN THE DOOR AT

2239
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
FIRST BUT WE DID.

2240
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
YOU KNOW, THEY SAID HAVE THE

2241
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
CHILDREN WALK, HOLD HANDS, COVER

2242
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
THEIR EYE IT IS THEY COULD

2243
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T SAY

2244
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
WHY.
HE SAID HAVE THEM COVER THEIR

2245
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
EYES.
AT 5, COVERING YOUR EYES AND

2246
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
WALKING ISN'T SO EASY.

2247
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I JUST -- HAD THEM, YOU KNOW,

2248
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
LOOK TOWARDS THE WALL AND WE

2249
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
WENT DOWN THE HALL AND OUT OF

2250
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
THE BUILDING.
AND, YOU KNOW, WE GOT ON THE

2251
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
SIDEWALK AND I SAID BOYS AND

2252
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000

2253
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000

THAT IS A TOUGH QUESTION.

2268

BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THOUGHTFUL

2269

DISCUSSION.
SOMETHING THAT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE

BAYER ASPIRIN WAS THE FIRST

2360
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000

BOPRODUCTIVITY UP, COSTS DOWN,
THTIME TO MARKET REDUCED...

2361
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
THOSE ARE GOOD THINGS.

2362
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
UPSTAIRS, THEY WILL SEE FANTASY.

2363
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
NOT FANTASY... LOGISTICS.

2364
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
UPS CAME IN, ANALYZED OUR SUPPLY
CHAIN, INVENTORY SYSTEMS...

2365
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
UPS?

2366
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
UPS.

2367
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
NOT FANTASY?

2368
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?

2369
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I DID.

2370
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
WE DID, BOB. WE DID.

2371
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,000
GOT IT.

2372

>>> WE ARE ALL LOOKING FOR

2373
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
ANSWERS AFTER MUST HAVE TOWN.

2374
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE TRAGEDIES

2375
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
LIKE SANDY HOOK ARING A DIRECT

2376
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
RESULT OF REMOVING GOD FROM OUR

2377
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
SOCIETY.
FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR MIKE

2378
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
HUCKABEE SAID AS MUCH.

2379
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
>> WE ASK WHY THERE'S VIOLENCE

2380
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
IN OUR SCHOOLS.

2381
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
BUT WE HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY

2382
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
REMOVED GOD FROM OUR SCHOOLS.

2383
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
SHOULD WE BE SO SURPRISED

2384
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
SCHOOLS WOULD BECOME PLACE OF

2385
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
CARNAGE BECAUSE WE HAVE MADE

2386
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,000
EIGHT PLACE WE DON'T WANT TO

2387
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:40,000
TALK ABOUT ETERNITY, LIFE, WHAT

2388
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
RESPONSIBILITY MEANS.

2389
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT WITH

2390
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,000
FATHER THOMAS REESE.

2391
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
THANK YOU, FATHER, IMPORTANT

2392
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
BEING WITH US TODAY.

2393
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
>> THANK YOU.

2394
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
>> I'M GOING TO ASK YOU THE BIG

2395
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
QUESTION FIRST.

2396
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
WHY DOES GOD ALLOW THESE THINGS

2397
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
TO HAPPEN?

2398
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
>> WELL, THAT'S -- IF I KNEW,

2399
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
COULD ANSWER THAT IN A SIMPLE

2400
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
SOUND BITE, I WOULD BE A GENIUS.

2401
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT PEOPLE

2402
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,000
HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH FOR

2403
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
CENTURIES.
ALL RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS STRUGGLE

2404
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
WITH THIS QUESTION.

2405
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I THINK PART OF IT IS WHAT WE

2406
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
THINK ABOUT GOD.

2407
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
DO WE SEE GOD AS THIS ABSTRACT

2408
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
BEING THAT IS IN CONTROL, MICRO

2409
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
MANAGE IT IS UNIVERSE?

2410
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I MEAN, THE GOD OF GREEK FILLS

2411
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
ON PERFECTS?

2412
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
OR DO WE LOOK AT THE GOD THAT'S

2413
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
PORTRAYED IN SCRIPTURES WHERE WE

2414
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
SEE A GOD OF COMPASSION.

2415
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
A GOD THAT, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES

2416
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
DOESN'T GET WHAT HE WANTS.

2417
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
BAD THINGS HAPPEN AND HE --

2418
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
WEEPS OVER IT.

2419
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
HE WEEPS OVER WHAT HAPPENS TO

2420
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
HIS CHILDREN.

2421
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
THIS IS THE GOD FOR ME.

2422
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
THE GOD THAT JESUS SHOWED US.

2423
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
A GOD WHO IS SUFFERING, A GOD

2424
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
WHO IS COMPASSIONATE TOWARDS HIS

2425
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,000
FRIENDS, WHO WEPT WHEN LAZARETH

2426
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
DIED.

2427
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
HE DOESN'T ALWAYS GET HIS WAY

2428
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
AND THAT'S WHEN THESE KIND OF

2429
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
TRAGEDIES HAPPEN.

2430
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
>> LET'S GO BACK TO WHAT

2431
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
GOVERNOR HUCKABEE SAID.

2432
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
HE SAID RAE MOVING GOD FROM OUR

2433
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND SOCIETY IN

2434
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
GENERAL, THAT'S TO BLAME FOR THE

2435
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
EVIL THAT HAPPENS IN THIS WORLD.

2436
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
DO YOU AGREE?

2437
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
>> WELL -- AS A CATHOLIC PRIEST,

2438
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I OBVIOUSLY BELIEVE IN THE

2439
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
IMPORTANCE OF HAVING RELIGION

2440
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
AND GOD IN SCHOOLS.

2441
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CATHOLIC

2442
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
SCHOOLS.
BUT TO THINK THAT SOMEHOW

2443
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
MAGICALLY THAT WILL SOLVE THE

2444
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
PROBLEMS OF VIOLENCE AND

2445
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
BULLYING OR WILL SOMEHOW CURE

2446
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL DISEASES

2447
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
AND DISORDERS OR WILL SOMEHOW

2448
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
DEAL, YOU KNOW, TAKE CARE OF

2449
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES, MINE,

2450
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
THAT'S TOTALLY ABSURD.

2451
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
AND IT ALSO MISSES THE POINT

2452
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
THAT, YOU KNOW, HOW DO WE TALK

2453
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
ABOUT GOD AND RELIGION IN PUBLIC

2454
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
SCHOOLS IN A PLURALISTIC SOCIETY

2455
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
WHERE THERE'S LOTS OF

2456
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
DISAGREEMENT?

2457
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
IT IS INTERESTG, ALMOST 50

2458
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,000
YEARS AGO, 1963, WHEN THE

2459
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
SUPREME COURT SAID THAT PUBLIC

2460
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
SCHOOLS SHOULD NOT PROMOTE

2461
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
DEVOTION, SHOULD NOT BE HAVING

2462
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
PRAYERS, IT SAID WE SHOULD TEACH

2463
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
ABOUT RELIGION.

2464
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
WE HAVE BEEN, YOU KNOW, HAD LOTS

2465
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
OF CONVERSATIONS AMONG RELIGIOUS

2466
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
LEADERS ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT AND

2467
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
HOW TO DO THAT IN A

2468
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
CONSTITUTIONAL WAY.
BECAUSE WE IMMEDIATE TO KNOW

2469
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
MORE ABOUT RELIGION.

2470
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
>> THEN, YOU KNOW, ANOTHER

2471
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
QUESTION I HAVE BEEN WONDER

2472
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
BEING.
WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT PERSONAL

2473
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
LIBERTY, THEY ALWAYS SAY GOD AND

2474
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:39,000
GUNS AS IF GOD AND GUNS ARE

2475
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
SYNONYMOUS, ARE EQUAL.

2476
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM?

2477
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
>> WELL, I MEAN, I THINK -- YOU

2478
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
KNOW, WE HAVE LIBERTY BUT WE

2479
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
ALSO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY.

2480
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
WITH FREEDOM COMES

2481
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
RESPONSIBILITY.

2482
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
AND AS -- AS A NATION, I MEAN, I

2483
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
PERSONALLY THINK, YOU KNOW, WERE

2484
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
DO WE IMMEDIATE ASSAULT RIFLES?

2485
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
WE DON'T IMMEDIATE THEM TO SHOOT

2486
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
DEER.

2487
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
WE DON'T IMMEDIATE THESE WEAPONS

2488
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
THAT ARE WEAPONS FROM WAR AS

2489
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
SPORTS WEAPONS.

2490
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
I THINK WE SHOULD DEAL WITH THIS

2491
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,000
IN A RATIONAL WAY.

2492
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
AND, YOU KNOW, BUT IT -- IT IS

2493
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
ALL OF THESE THINGS.

2494
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
IT IS DEALING WITH MENTAL

2495
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,000
DISORDERS.
IT IS DEALING WITH THE AMOUNT OF

2496
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
WEAPONS THAT ARE OUT WILL IN

2497
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
SOCIETY.
IT IS DEALING WITH DYSFUNCTIONAL

2498
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
FAMILIES.
ALL OF THESE KINDS OF THINGS

2499
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
NEED TO BE, YOU KNOW, PART OF

2500
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
THE SOLUTION.

2501
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, YOU KNOW,

2502
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
FOR THE FREEDOM WE HAVE IS ALSO

2503
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
THE FREEDOM TO REJECT GOD AND TO

2504
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,000
SIN AND TO DO VIOLENT ACTS AND

2505
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
THAT'S PART OF THE HUMAN

2506
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
CONDITION ALSO.

2507
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
>> PEAR THOMAS, THANK YOU SO

2508
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
MUCH IMPORTANT BEING WITH US

2509
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
THIS MORNING.
I CAN TALK TO YOU ALL DAY.

2510
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

2511
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:58,000
QUESTIONS?

2512
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
ANYONE HAVE OCCASIONAL
CONSTIPATION,

2513
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
DIARRHEA, GAS, BLOATING?

2514
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
YEAH.

2515
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
ONE Phillips' Colon Health
