BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS ENORMOUS

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
TRAGEDY.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
NO WORDS CAN TRULY EXPRESS HOW

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
HEARTBROKEN WE ARE.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
HE IS THE FATHER OF ADAM LANZA.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
THIS IS A PICTURE OF HIM FROM

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
JUST A FEW YEARS AGO.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
HE IS NOW 20 YEARS OLD WHO

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
POLICE SAY WALKED INTO AN

INCLUDING THE PRINCIPAL, THEY'RE

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
ALL DEAD NOW, TOO.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
THE SHOOTER KILLED HIMSELF.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
THIS IS WHERE POLICE ARE TRYING

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO ANSWER THE

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
QUESTIONS WHY.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
THE LANZA HOME, NOT FAR FROM THE

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
SCHOOL.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
IT'S ALSO WHERE THE SUSPECTED
SHOOTER'S MOTHER WAS FOUND DEAD

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
AS WELL.

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
TODAY, THE FATHER AND AUNT OF

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
ONE OF THE SHOOTING VICTIMS IN

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, WENT

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
BEFORE CAMERAS TO REMEMBER A

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
CHILD THEY DESCRIBED AS

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
INCREDIBLE BUT IN REMEMBERING

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
LITTLE EMILIE PARKER, THEY SAID,

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
THEY'RE PRAYING FOR THE

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
SHOOTER'S FAMILY, TOO, BECAUSE

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
THAT'S WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
WANTED.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
KYUNG LAH WAS THERE.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
KYUNG, WHAT STUCK OUT TO YOU

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
MOST OF ALL WHEN YOU WERE

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
TALKING TO THESE PEOPLE AND YOU
WATCHED ALL OF THIS?

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
>> THE ABILITY OF THEM TO BE

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
ABLE TO STILL THINK OF OTHER

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
PEOPLE AND SOCIETY IN THE FACE

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
OF AN UNSPEAKABLE LOSS.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
IF YOU'RE A PARENT, IF YOU HAVE

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
CHILDREN WHO YOU LOVE AND YOU

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
THINK ABOUT THIS HAPPENING TO

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
YOURSELF, IT'S REALLY HARD TO

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
COMPREHEND, THEN BEING ABLE TO

69
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
FACE NATIONAL CAMERAS, REPORTERS

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
AND MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
SOCIETY.

72
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS FAMILY HAS

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
DONE.
AND HERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
THEY SAID.

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
>> EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
TWO LITTLE SISTERS AND DELIGHTED

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
IN TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ,

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
DANCE AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS
IN LIFE.

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
EMILIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
PLEASURE TO MEET HER WOULD AGREE

82
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
THAT THIS WORLD IS A BETTER
PLACE BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN IN IT.

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
>> EMILIE ALICE PARKER WAS THE

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
SWEETEST LITTLE GIRL I'VE EVER

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
KNOWN.

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
MY CHILDREN ARE GRIEVING.

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
MY SIBLINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
ARE GRIEVING AND WE'RE JUST

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
DEVASTATED THAT SOMEONE SO

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT IS NO

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
LONGER GOING TO BE IN OUR LIVES

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
AND FOR NO REASON.

93
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
>> AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
HAPPENED HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
SO MANY PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
INTO SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US.

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
BUT SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US
TO BE BETTER, TO BE MORE

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
COMPASSIONATE AND MORE HUMBLE

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
PEOPLE.

100
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
>> WHAT HE SAID IS THAT HE

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
SIMPLY WANTED PEOPLE TO BE ABLE

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
TO BECOME MORE TOLERANT, TO BE

103
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
MORE HUMANE.

104
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
HE IS HOPING THAT THIS IS GOING

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
TO BE AN EVENT WHERE PEOPLE LOOK

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
NOT AT THE SHOOTER, NOT AT THE

107
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
CRIME ITSELF BUT IN TRYING TO

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
BECOME BETTER PEOPLE FOR THE
GREATER GOOD OF SOCIETY.

109
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
IT'S REALLY, TRULY REMARKABLE,

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
THIS FATHER CAME HERE EIGHT

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
HE'S HERE TO TRY TO HELP

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
CHILDREN GET BETTER AND YET HIS

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
CHILD WAS LOST DUE TO GUN

118
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
VIOLENCE.

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
IN THE FACE OF UNSPEAKABLE LOSS,

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
STUNNING.

125
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
KYUNG LAH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH

130
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000

131
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
WANT TO TALK ABOUT VICTORIA

132
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
SOTO, SHE ADORED HER STUDENTS

133
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
CALLING THEM HER KIDS.

134
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
WHEN THE SHOOTING STARTED, SHE

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
DID WHAT SHE COULD TO PROTECT

136
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
THEM.

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
TONIGHT, RESIDENTS OF STRATFORD,

138
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000

PEOPLE AT A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
WORE GREEN.
THE 27-YEAR-OLD'S FAVORITE

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
COLOR.

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
SHE TAUGHT FIRST GRADE AT SANDY

143
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

144
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
CNN'S JASON CARROLL JOINS ME NOW

145
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
WITH MORE ON THAT VIGIL.

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
HOW IS THIS COMMUNITY DEALING

147
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
WITH THIS EXTRAORDINARY LOSS
RIGHT NOW?

148
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
>> THEY'RE JUST COMPLETELY TORN

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
UP.

150
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO SAY IT,

151
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
TO SEE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE,

152
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
HUNDREDS WHO CAME OUT HERE AT

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
STRATFORD HIGH SCHOOL.

154
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THIS IS WHERE VICTORIA, VICKI AS

155
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
EVERYONE CALLED HER, VICKI SOTO,

156
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
THIS IS WHERE SHE GRADUATED BACK

157
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
IN 2003.
WHEN EVERYONE GOT TOGETHER HERE

158
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
TONIGHT, THEY DID THEIR BEST TO

159
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
REMEMBER HER.

160
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW SOTO

161
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A TEACHER,

162
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
EVER SINCE SHE WAS A LITTLE
GIRL.

163
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
SHE TALKED ABOUT WANTING TO BE A

164
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
TEACHER, THAT'S WHAT HER FRIENDS

165
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
SAID.
TONIGHT THEY TALKED ABOUT THE

166
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
HEROIC ACTIONS THAT SHE TOOK IN

167
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
HER CLASSROOM WHEN THE GUNMAN

168
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
BURST THROUGH THE DOOR, HOW SHE

169
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
RUSHED THE KIDS INTO A CLOSET TO

170
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
TRY AND SAVE THEM AND THEN OOF

171
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
COURSE THE GUNMAN TOOK HER LIFE.

172
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
AS WE WERE OUT HERE TONIGHT WITH

173
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
HER SISTERS AND HER BROTHER, HER

174
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
COUSINS AND ALL OF HER FRIENDS,

175
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
AND DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO

176
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
REMEMBER HER, I SPOKE TO ONE

177
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
YOUNG WOMAN, A FRIEND OF SOTO'S

178
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

179
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
JUST LISTEN TO HOW SHE STRUGGLED

180
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
TO TALK ABOUT HOW SHE WILL
REMEMBER HER.

181
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
>> SHE WAS ALWAYS AT THE HOUSE

182
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
SMILING.
SHE DROVE US TO CHEERLEADING

183
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
PRACTICES A COUPLE OF TIMES.

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'M ALSO A TEACHER AND I CAN'T

185
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
EVEN IMAGINE GOING THROUGH WHAT

186
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
SHE WENT THROUGH.

187
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I THINK HER PUTTING HERSELF OUT

188
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
THERE -- SHE'S JUST AN ANGEL AND

189
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
SHE JUST WENT STRAIGHT INTO

190
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
HEAVEN.

191
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

192
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
>> DON, THE REASON WHY SOTO'S

193
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
FAMILY DECIDED TO HOLD THIS

194
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
VIGIL TONIGHT, THE REASON WHY

195
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
THEY SHOWED UP AND GAVE US

196
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
PICTURES, PICTURES BY THE WAY

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
THAT SOTO'S MOTHER PICKED OUT

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
BECAUSE THEY WERE HER FAVORITE

199
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
PICTURES.

200
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
THE REASON WHY THEY DID ALL THIS

201
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
IS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT

202
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
SOTO TO BE REMEMBERED AS JUST A

203
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
VICTIM.

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
THEY WANTED HER TO BE REMEMBERED
AS A DEDICATED TEACHER, A LOVING

205
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
DAUGHTER, A LOVING SISTER.

206
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
AT ONE POINT HER SISTER, CARLEY,

207
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
SHE STOOD UP AND SPOKE TO

208
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
EVERYONE WHO CAME OUT HERE TODAY

209
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
AND SHE SAID THE WORDS THAT SHE

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
HAD TWEETED EARLIER TODAY.

211
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
SHE SAID, HUG YOUR LOVED ONES,

212
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
TELL THEM HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THEM

213
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU

214
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
WILL EVER SEE THEM AGAIN.

215
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
THESE WERE THE WORDS SPOKEN BY

216
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
HER YOUNGER SISTER, 19-YEAR-OLD

217
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
CARLEY.
THIS IS HOW THEY WANT HER

218
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
REMEMBERED.
DON?

219
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
>> JASON, YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.

220
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
THESE ARE NOT JUST VICTIMS.

221
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
THEY'RE STROOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE

222
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
LED EXTRAORDINARY LIVE AND TAKEN

223
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
AWAY WAY TOO SOON.

224
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
JASON CARROLL, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH FOR THAT REPORT.

225
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
WITNESSES SAY THE FIRST SHOTS

226
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
RANG OUT YESTERDAY JUST AFTER

227
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
THE MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE

228
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
BEING READ AT SANDY HOOK
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

229
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
POLICE ARE TRYING TO HAMMER DOWN

230
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE

231
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
THAT MOMENT.
AND OUR TOM FOREMAN HAS A

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
BREAKDOWN ON WHAT INVESTIGATORS

233
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
KNOW SO FAR.

234
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
>> POLICE ARE SEARCHING OVER AN

235
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
IMMENSE CLUE FOR ANY CLUE WHY

236
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
THIS HAPPENED.

237
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
THEY'VE SEARCHED THE BROTHER'S

238
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
APARTMENT DOWN HERE IN NEW

239
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
JERSEY.

240
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THEY BELIEVE THE GUNMAN WENT

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
DIRECTLY HERE AFTER HIS MOTHER'S

242
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
MURDER AND EMERGED FROM HIS CAR

243
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
IN THE PARKING LOT CARRYING
WEAPONS VERY MUCH LIKE THESE.

244
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
BUT WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

245
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
LET'S LOOK AT THE TIME LINE

246
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
BASED ON POLICE RADIO REPORTS
AND EYEWITNESSES.

247
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
9:30 IN THE MORNING, THAT'S WHEN

248
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
WE BELIEVE THAT HE EMERGED FROM

249
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
HIS CAR AND HEADED INTO THE

250
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
SCHOOL HERE.

251
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
WEP DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS HIS

252
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
CAR.

253
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
BUT THEY'VE PAID A LOT OF
ATTENTION TO THIS VEHICLE OVER

254
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
THE PAST FEW DAYS.

255
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
HERE IS WHERE HE ENCOUNTERED HIS

256
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
FIRST BARRICADE BECAUSE THERE

257
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
WAS A SECURITY SYSTEM ON THE

258
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
DOORS THERE RECENTLY PUT IN BY

259
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
THE PRINCIPAL, WHERE HE WOULD

260
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
HAVE TO BE BUZZED IN.

261
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
POLICE LATER FOUND THAT THE

262
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
GLASS HERE HAD BEEN SHOT OUT OR

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
BROKEN OUT IN SOME FASHION.

264
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
THAT SEEMS TO BE HOW HE ENTERED

265
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
THE SCHOOL.

266
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?

267
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
WELL, THE FIRST CALL TO THE

268
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
POLICE THAT SAID THERE WAS A

269
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
PROBLEM CAME AT 9:36.

270
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
THE FIRST CALL SAYING THERE IS

271
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
GUNFIRE INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

272
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE IN THE SCHOOL

273
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
KNEW IT BECAUSE THEY COULD

274
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
EITHER HEAR IT DIRECTLY OR

275
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
BECAUSE THEY HEARD IT OVER THE

276
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
SCHOOL'S P.A. SYSTEM, THERE WERE

277
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
ANNOUNCEMENTS BEING MADE AT THE

278
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
TIME.

279
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
ALL THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE IN A

280
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
A VERY SMALL AREA UP IN THIS

281
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
PART OF THE SCHOOL.

282
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY

283
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
ELSE HAVE SOME IDEA THAT THIS

284
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
WAS GOING ON SO THEY COULD TRY

285
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
TO BE SAFE IN THESE

286
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
CIRCUMSTANCES.

287
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
BEYOND THAT, WHAT HAPPENED?

288
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
AT 9:38, POLICE WERE SAYING

289
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
ALREADY THEY WERE HEARING

290
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
REPORTS THAT THE SHOOTING WAS

291
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
OVER.
AN INCREDIBLY SHORT PERIOD OF

292
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
TIME.

293
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
2, 2 1/2 MINUTES, MAYBE, WHERE

294
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
THE BULK, IF NOT ALL OF THE

295
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
SHOOTING TOOK PLACE.

296
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
WHAT WAS THE NEXT PHASE OF ALL

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
OF THIS?

298
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
THE NEXT PHASE CAME WHEN AT

299
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
ABOUT 9:40, POLICE AT THE SCHOOL

300
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
SAID, WE NEED SOME EMERGENCY

301
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
MEDICAL SERVICES HERE.

302
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
THAT WAS THE FIRST CALL FOR
AMBULANCES.

303
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
IT WAS FOR TWO AMBULANCES TO

304
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
BEGIN WITH AND THEN AS THEY

305
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
REALIZED THEY HAD MANY MORE

306
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
VICTIMS IN A MATTER OF MINUTES,

307
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
THERE WAS A CALL FOR MANY, MANY

308
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
MORE EMERGENCY MEDICAL

309
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
TECHNICIANS AND AMBULANCES TO

310
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
COME TO THE SCHOOL.

311
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
AND THEN SURPRISINGLY, BY 9:50

312
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
IN THE MORNING, POLICE WERE

313
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT THEY HAD

314
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
A SUSPECT WHO WAS DOWN, MEANING

315
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
THEY HAD HAD ONE SUSPECT WHO IS

316
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
DEAD, THEY HAD SECURED THE

317
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
BUILDING TO SOME DEGREE.

318
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
THEY'D CLEARED THE BUILDING IS

319
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THE LANGUAGE THEY USED.

320
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
AND A LOT OF THE KIDS WERE BEING

321
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
LED AWAY.

322
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
THIS IS A PICTURE FROM "THE

323
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
NEWTOWN BEE" OF THE KIDS BEING

324
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
LED AWAY.

325
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
THIS IS A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF

326
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
TIME, FROM 17 TO 20 MINUTES THAT

327
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
THIS WENT FROM NOTHING HAPPENING

328
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
TO ALL OF THESE EVENTS HAPPENING

329
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
THAT HAVE CHANGED THE LIVES OF

330
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
SO MANY PEOPLE.

331
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
AND POLICE WILL CONTINUE GOING
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE

332
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
DETAILS OF THE MOVEMENT OF THIS

333
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
SHOOTER AND HIS VICTIMS TO TRY

334
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF

335
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
PRECISELY HOW IT ALL HAPPENED.

336
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
>> TOM, THANKS.

337
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT BUILDING

338
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
AFFECTED EVERYONE.

339
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
THE TRAGEDY IS TOUGH FOR THE

340
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
ENTIRE COMMUNITY HERE.

341
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
AND THOSE NOT DIRECTLY AFFECTED

342
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
STILL WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

343
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
EARLIER, I SPOKE WITH TWO WOMEN

344
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
TRYING TO DO JUST THAT.

345
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
WHEN YOU CAME UP THO TALK TO ME,

346
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
YOU LADIES COULD BARELY GET THE

347
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
WORDS OUT.

348
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
>> THIS IS -- THERE ARE NO

349
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
WORDS.

350
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
THERE ARE NO WORDS.

351
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
AND EVEN RIGHT NOW, WE KNOW THAT

352
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
FAMILIES ARE CRYING TOGETHER,

353
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
TRYING TO GET THROUGH DAY TO

354
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
DAY.
AND WE FEEL THAT SINCE WE

355
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
WEREN'T DIRECTLY IMPACTED, WE

356
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
FEEL LIKE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

357
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
USE OUR VOICES TO SAY THINGS

358
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
THAT WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE

359
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
GOING TO BE SAYING FOR A LONG

360
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
TIME AFTER THE CAMERAS ARE GONE.

361
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
AND SOMETIMES IT'S AFTER THE

362
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
CAMERAS ARE GONE THAT THINGS

363
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
STOP WORKING.

364
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
AND MOTION STOPS.

365
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
>> FOR YOU, YOU'VE BEEN CRYING

366
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
THE ENTIRE TIME YOU'RE STANDING

367
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
HERE.

368
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
>> THERE ARE NO WORDS.

369
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
THERE ARE NO ADEQUATE WORDS TO

370
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000

CLAIMING SHE HEARD SHOTS.

553
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
AND THAT'S WHEN WE HEARD A LOT

554
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
OF SIRENS GOING OFF.

555
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
AND THAT'S WHEN WE GOT VERY

556
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
CONCERNED BECAUSE THE SCHOOL DID

557
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
NOT PICK UP THE PHONE.

558
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
WE CALLED THE SCHOOL.
THEY DID NOT PICK UP THE PHONE.

559
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
THAT WAS WHEN WE REALLY BECAME

560
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
CONCERNED.
>> ONCE YOU GOT THERE, YOU SAID

561
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
YOU GOT TO THE PERIMETER OF THE

562
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
SCHOOL.

563
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
>> RIGHT.
>> ONCE YOU GOT THERE, THEN

564
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
WHAT?
>> THEN IT WAS JUST HORRIFYING.

565
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
WITHIN A MATTER OF THREE

566
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
MINUTES, WE SAW TWO STUDENTS

567
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
BEING CARRIED OUT BY STATE
TROOPERS.

568
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
THEY WERE NOT MOVING.

569
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
THEY WERE VERY PALE AND IT WAS

570
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
JUST A VERY HORRIFYING SCENE.

571
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
AND THEN A THIRD FEMALE CAME

572
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
OUT.
SHE HAD A LOT OF BLOOD OVER HER

573
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
FACE.
IT WAS JUST HORRIBLE.

574
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
IT WAS BLOOD SPLATTER FROM OTHER

575
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
STUDENTS WAS MY GUESS BECAUSE

576
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
SHE WAS WALKING FINE.

577
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
>> THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT

578
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, 5, 6, 7

579
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
YEARS OLD.
>> YEAH, NO MORE THAN THAT.

580
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

581
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
>> DID YOU FEEL HELPLESS IN NOT

582
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING?

583
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S THE

584
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
BEST WORD TO DESCRIBE IT.
HELPLESS.

585
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I WAS WAITING FOR MY SISTER.

586
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
IT WAS 20 MINUTES BETWEEN THE

587
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
TIME I SAW THOSE OTHER

588
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
FEMALES --
>> YOUR SISTER GOES TO THE

589
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
SCHOOL?
>> YES, SHE DOES.

590
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
>> YOU DIDN'T KNOW --

591
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
>> I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS

592
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
HAPPENING TO HER.

593
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
>> YOUR SISTER IS 7?

594
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
>> SHE'S 9.

595
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
>> SHE'S 9?

596
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
>> CORRECT.
>> NOT KNOWING IN THOSE

597
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
MOMENTS --
>> IT WAS HORRIBLE.

598
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
THOUGHTS WERE RUNNING THROUGH MY

599
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
HEAD, ALL MY MEMORIES WITH HER

600
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
WERE RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD

601
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
DURING THOSE 20 MINUTES.

602
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
IT SEEMED LIKE DAYS.

603
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
BUT IT WAS HORRIFYING.

604
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
>> WHEN DID SHE COME OUT?

605
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
>> SHE CAME OUT ABOUT 20 MINUTES

606
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
AFTER THE -- I SAW THE OTHER

607
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
STUDENTS -- THE TWO OTHER

608
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
STUDENTS THAT UNFORTUNATELY WERE

609
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
PRONOUNCED DEAD LATER ON.

610
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
AND THE STUDENTS -- ALL THE

611
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
STUDENTS WERE CRYING AND

612
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
SOBBING.

613
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
AND THEY WERE JUST -- THEY WERE

614
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
TRAUMATIZED.

615
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
>> HOW'S YOUR SISTER DOING?

616
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
>> SHE'S DOING WELL.

617
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
AGAIN, SHE'S VERY TRAUMATIZED

618
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
NATURALLY.

619
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
BUT I CREDIT THE TEACHERS FOR

620
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
KEEPING THEM CALM.

621
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
THEY'RE VERY HEROIC TEACHERS
THAT DAY.

622
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
THE PRINCIPAL, THERE WERE

623
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
MULTIPLE TEACHERS THAT DID A

624
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
FANTASTIC JOB KEEPING THE

625
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
CHILDREN CALM.

626
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
>> WHAT DID YOUR SISTER SAY?

627
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
DID SHE HEAR ANYTHING --

628
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
>> YEAH.

629
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
THE FIRST THING SHE TOLD ME WAS

630
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
THAT SHE HAD HEARD THE INTERCOM

631
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
SYSTEM COME ON AND THROUGH THE

632
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
INTERCOM, SHE HEARD SCREAMS AND

633
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
BULLETS -- SHE HEARD THE

634
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
GUNSHOTS AND THE SCREAMS

635
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
OCCURRING IN THE MAIN OFFICE OF
THE BUILDING.

636
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHEN THE

637
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
SCHOOL WENT INTO LOCKDOWN.

638
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
>> A 9-YEAR-OLD.

639
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
CAN YOU IMAGINE A 9-YEAR-OLD

640
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
HAVING TO DEAL WITH THAT?
I JUST CAN'T.

641
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
>> IT'S TRAUMATIC.

642
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
>> TELL US -- TALK TO OUR

643
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
VIEWERS AND EVERYONE WHO'S

644
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
WATCHING HERE ABOUT HOW YOU GUYS

645
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
ARE DOING, YOUR SISTER, YOUR

646
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
FAMILY, THE COMMUNITY?

647
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
>> FIRST OFF, I'D REALLY LIKE TO

648
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
GIVE MY CONDOLENCES TO EVERYONE

649
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
WHO'S SUFFERING FROM THIS,

650
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS, IT'S AN

651
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY.

652
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
BUT I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE

653
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
IN NEWTOWN.

654
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
CULTURALLY WE'RE A VERY, VERY

655
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
STRONG TOWN.

656
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
AND WE STICK TOGETHER.

657
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
WE'RE A TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY.

658
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO WORK

659
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
THROUGH THIS.

660
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
EVERYONE CARES ABOUT EVERYONE.

661
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
AND THAT'S JUST WHO WE ARE.

662
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
THAT'S OUR CULTURE.

663
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
>> YOU'RE 17?

664
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
>> YES.
>> THE SHOOTER IS 20.

665
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
DID YOU KNOW HIM?
>> NO.

666
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
BUT UPON HEARING HE WAS 20, I

667
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
WAS SHOCKED.

668
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I WAS LOST FOR WORDS.

669
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
HOW COULD SOMEONE SO YOUNG

670
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
COMMIT SUCH A HEINOUS ACT.

671
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
>> YOU DON'T KNOW HIS FAMILY?

672
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
>> I DO NOT.

673
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I DO NOT.

674
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.

675
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I APPRECIATE IT.

676
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
>> WE'RE GLAD YOUR SISTER IS
OKAY.

677
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
AGAIN, OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS

678
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
ARE WITH EVERYONE HERE.
>> THANK YOU.

679
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
>> ESHT PROO IT.

680
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
IT'S GOING TO BE AMAZING JUST TO

681
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
WATCH THIS COMMUNITY IN THE

682
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
COMING DAYS TRY TO DEAL WITH

683
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
TH

684
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
THIS, TO SEE HOW THEY'RE GOING

685
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
TO COPE, HOW THE WORLD IS GOING

686
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
TO TRY TO HELP THEM GET THROUGH

687
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
IT, WHAT WORDS OF COMFORT THE

688
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
PRESIDENT WILL OFFER THEM AS
WELL.

689
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
WE'LL BE HERE TO COVER IT FOR

690
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
YOU HERE ON CNN.

691
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
A LITTLE WHILE AGO, I TOOK A

692
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
WALK THROUGH THIS TOWN, THIS

693
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
TOWN OF JUST 27,000 PEOPLE, ALL

694
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
OF THEM STILL TRYING TO PROCESS

695
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
THE HORROR OF WHAT HAPPENED JUST

696
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
DOWN THE ROAD.

697
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
RIGHT BEHIND ME, THAT'S THE ROAD

698
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
THAT LEADS UP TO THE SCHOOL

699
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
WHERE THIS HAPPENED.

700
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
IT HAS BEEN BLOCKED OFF.
YOU CAN SEE THE SIGN HERE RIGHT

701
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
ACROSS THE STREET ON THAT PORCH,

702
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
IT SAYS, GOD BLESS SANDY HOOK.

703
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
AND RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF

704
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
THE SQUARE, 26 CANDLES FOR ALL

705
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS TRAGEDY

706
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
RIGHT HERE AT THE TIME SQUARE.

707
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
AND UP THE STREET, A CHURCH

708
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
WHERE THE VICTIMS ARE BEING

709
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
MEMORIALIZED.

710
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
THIS IS ONE OF THE INTIMATE
LITTLE SQUARES HERE IN SANDY

711
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
HOOK.

712
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
YOU CAN SEE THE LITTLE QUAINT

713
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
STORES, BEAUTIFUL LITTLE STORES.

714
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
AND THEN COME THIS WAY, YOU CAN

715
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
SEE JUST THE MEDIA.

716
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
AND PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THIS

717
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
SQUARE OVER.

718
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE HERE, THEY

719
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
SAY, THERE'S NEVER THIS MANY

720
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
PEOPLE.
THERE ARE NEVER THIS MANY PEOPLE

721
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
WHO COME TO THIS TOWN ON A

722
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
SATURDAY OR SUNDAY.

723
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
TO SEE HOW INTIMATE AND

724
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
BEAUTIFUL THIS TOWN IS, LOOK, A

725
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
CREEK THAT RUNS RIGHT THROUGH

726
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
IT.

727
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
THE PEOPLE OF THIS SMALL TOWN

728
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
PROBABLY NEVER DREAMED THAT

729
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
THEIR TOWN WOULD BE THE FOCUS OF
SUCH PAIN AND ANGUISH AND

730
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
SORROW.

731
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THIS IS THE NEWTOWN UNITED

732
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
METHODIST CHURCH AND WHERE A LOT

733
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
OF THE MEDIA ARE CAMPED OUT.

734
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
THERE'S THE CHURCH BEHIND ME.

735
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
IT'S BEEN OPENED NOW FOR 24

736
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
HOURS.

737
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
IT'S GOING TO BE OPEN MORE 24

738
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
HOURS FOR AS LONG AS THEY NEED

739
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
IT HERE.

740
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THAT

741
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
CHURCH DIED AND ANYONE WHO WANTS

742
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
TO COME BY AND PAY THEIR

743
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
RESPECTS TO THE PEOPLE WHO DIED,

744
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
ANYONE WHO NEEDS HELP FROM THIS

745
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
CHURCH, THEY CAN COME HERE AND

746
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
GET IT.

747
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
AFTER THIS SHOOTING INSIDE SANDY

748
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, THE

749
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
SAFETY ISSUE WILL NOW BE FRONT

750
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
AND CENTER AT SCHOOLS ACROSS THE

751
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
COUNTRY.

752
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
DO CLASSROOMS NEED TO BE CHANGED

753
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
INTO PANIC ROOMS OR AS I'VE BEEN

754
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
SAYING EARLIER, CAN WE MAKE

755
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
CLASSROOMS INTO MINI PRISONS?

756
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT WE MAY HAVE

757
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
TO MAKE OUR SCHOOLS IN ORDER TO

758
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
BE SAFE.

759
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I WANT TO BRING IN LOU PALUMBO.

760
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
SOME SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE

761
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
ROAMING OFFICERS, METAL

762
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
DETECTORS, OFFICERS ROAMING THE

763
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
HALLWAYS.

764
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE OUR

765
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
SCHOOLS SAFER?

766
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
DO WE NEED ALL OF THESE MEASURES

767
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
IN PLACE?

768
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
>> WELL, APPARENTLY BASED ON

769
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
THIS INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE UP

770
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
HERE YESTERDAY, I GUESS YOU

771
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
COULD SUPPORT THAT ARGUMENT.

772
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
IT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE TO THINK

773
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

774
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
CREATE ENVIRONMENTS FOR OUR

775
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
CHILDREN TO LEARN IN THAT ARE A

776
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
BIT MORE SECURE.

777
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
AND I DON'T THINK MY

778
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ANYTHING

779
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
THAT ARE EXTREME.
I MENTIONED TO YOU EARLIER, DON,

780
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
ONE THING I WOULD DO IS LOCK

781
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
THESE CLASSROOM DOORS.

782
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I WOULD CHANGE THE DOORS AND

783
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
FORTIFY THE LOCKS AND UPGRADE

784
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
THEM.

785
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
THE SAME ON ENTERING THE

786
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
BUILDING.

787
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
THERE'S A CONDITION WHAT WE CALL

788
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
A MANTRAP.

789
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
THAT'S WHEN YOU ENTER FROM AN

790
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
OUTER DOOR INTO A TYPE OF FOYER

791
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
AREA WHERE THERE'S ANOTHER DOOR

792
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
AND THAT DOOR IS SECURED UNTIL

793
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH WHO YOU
ARE.

794
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS
BIGGER ISSUES THAT ARE NOT JUST

795
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
IMPACTING OUR EDUCATIONAL

796
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
INSTITUTIONS BUT OUR ENTIRE

797
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
COUNTRY.

798
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
IT HAS TO DO WITH YOUR SAFETY,

799
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
OUR PEACE OF MIND.

800
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT A

801
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
CHANCE TO HEAR THE TWO MOTHER

802
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
THAT IS CAME UP AND WROTE ME THE

803
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
LETTER ABOUT WHAT THEY SAY TO

804
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
THEIR KIDS.
THEY SAY, OUR KIDS ARE ASKING

805
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
ALL THOSE QUESTIONS.

806
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS.

807
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
THEY'RE ASKING US ABOUT GOING

808
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
BACK TO SCHOOL ON MONDAY.

809
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
HOW DO YOU REASSURE PARENTS AND

810
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
EVEN STUDENTS THAT THEY'RE SAFE

811
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
AT SCHOOL?

812
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
CAN YOU REASSURE THEM?

813
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
CAN YOU BE SURE OF THAT?

814
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
>> APPARENTLY YOU CANNOT.

815
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
WHAT I WOULD DO IN THE

816
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
TRANSITIONAL PERIOD IN

817
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
PARTICULAR FOR THESE CHILDREN UP

818
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
HERE, I WOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF

819
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
UNIFORM LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE

820
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
TO EASE THEM THROUGH A

821
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
TRANSITION OF COMFORT AGAIN TO

822
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
WHERE THEY CAN START TO RELAX

823
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
AND FEEL A BIT MORE SECURE AND A

824
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
BIT MORE SAFE.

825
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I DON'T THINK THE GRAVITY OF

826
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
THIS SITUATION FOR ALL OF US HAS

827
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
SET IN YET, NOT IN THIS

828
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
COMMUNITY AND NOT IN THIS

829
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
NATION.

830
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALLY HAVE

831
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
THOUGHT THIS THROUGH WHAT THE

832
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
ANGUISH WAS FOR THESE BABIES IN

833
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
THAT CLASSROOM.

834
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
IT'S A LITTLE DISTURBING TO EVEN

835
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
SPEAK ABOUT IT.

836
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
>> THAT THIS HAPPENS -- I SAID

837
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
AMAZING EARLIER, AND THE

838
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
PERPLEXING SENSE OF THAT WORD

839
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
THAT EVERY TIME WE HEAR ABOUT

840
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
THIS, WE SAY, YOU KNOW, THE

841
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
COMMUNITY'S RESILIENT.

842
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
THEY'LL GET THROUGH IT.

843
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING TO SAY

844
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
THAT.
>> WITHOUT QUESTION.

845
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
AND WE SHOULDN'T BE BURYING

846
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
CHILDREN AT THIS AGE.

847
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
IT'S SYMPTOMATIC OF A MUCH

848
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
LARGER PROBLEM IN OUR COUNTRY.

849
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
>> I WENT ON THE AIR I THINK IT

850
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
WAS ABOUT 11:40 ON FRIDAY AND I

851
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
WAS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT SAFETY

852
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
AND SECURITY.

853
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
AND I SAID, LOU, YOU SEND YOUR

854
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
KIDS OFF TO SCHOOL AND THIS IS

855
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
THE WORST PHONE CALL THAT YOU

856
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
CAN GET.

857
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
THEN WE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS

858
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
JUST SOME ANGRY PARENT OR

859
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
SOMEONE WHO HAD JUST COME IN AND

860
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
THAT WAS THE ONLY PERSON

861
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
INVOLVED.

862
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
AND THEN AN HOUR LATER, WE FIND

863
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
OUT IT'S 20 CHILDREN INVOLVED IN

864
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
THIS SHOOTING.

865
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
WE HAVE TO STOP THIS.

866
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT MENTAL HEALTH

867
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
ISSUES AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

868
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
GUN LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY.

869
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
>> WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS

870
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
INTERPRETATION WE HAVE OF THE

871
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
CONSTITUTION.
AND I WOULD SAY INTERJECT SOME

872
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
LEVEL OF COMMON SENSE, DECENCY

873
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
AND SENSIBILITY.

874
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
NO ONE'S OPPOSED TO IS SECOND

875
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
AMENDMENT.

876
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'M CERTAINLY NOT.

877
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE.

878
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
>> I THINK WHEN PEOPLE SEE US DO

879
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
THIS -- THEY SAY, NO ONE'S

880
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
TRYING TO DO THAT.

881
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE TRYING

882
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
TO MAKE AN ISSUE OF.

883
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
LET'S REALLY TALK ABOUT THIS,

884
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
LOU.

885
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
WE DON'T COVER MULTIPLE

886
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
STABBINGS WHERE 20 PEOPLE -- 26

887
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
PEOPLE DIE IN A SCHOOL.

888
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
WE DON'T COVER WHERE MOLOTOV

889
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
COCKTAIL GOES OFF IN THE SCHOOL

890
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE.

891
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
IT'S USUALLY FROM SOMEONE WITH

892
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
SOME TYPE OF ASSAULT WEAPON AND

893
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
SOMEONE WHO HAS A SICK MIND WHO

894
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
GOES IN AND DOES THESE SORTS OF
THINGS.

895
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
>> THE REAL UNFORTUNATE PART IS

896
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
COUPLED WITH A SICK MIND OR

897
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
DERANGEMENT OR DELUSION, WE HAVE

898
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
A VEHICLE OF DELIVERY OF THEIR
MESSAGE.

899
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
THAT'S WHERE THE FIREARM COMES

900
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
IN.
WHAT WE SPOKE TO EARLIER IS

901
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
KNOWING A BIT MORE ABOUT THE

902
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
PEOPLE WE'RE PUTTING THESE

903
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
FIREARMS IN THE HANDS OF.

904
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
TALKING ABOUT JUST SCREENING
PEOPLE PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

905
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
THIS IS NOT AN ANOMALY.

906
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
THIS IS BECOMING A PATTERN.

907
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
ALTHOUGH THEY WOULD LIKE TO

908
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
STATISTICALLY ADDRESS THIS BY

909
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
SAYING THE NUMBER OF TIMES OR

910
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
THE PERCENTAGE OF THESE

911
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
INCIDENTS IN DIRECT PROPORTION

912
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
TO OUR POPULATION ARE .5%.

913
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
THAT'S A GREAT STATISTIC UNLESS

914
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
IT'S YOUR CHILD.

915
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
BUT THERE ARE WAYS WE CAN DO

916
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
THIS.
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS

917
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
TAKE THE POLITICAL ASPECT OF

918
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
THIS THING OUT AND SIT DOWN THE

919
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

920
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
CHANGE THE WAY WE'RE ADDRESSING

921
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
THIS.

922
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
THIS IS A DISGUSTING PROBLEM

923
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH --

924
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
>> AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

925
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
HAVE TO DEAL WITH.
THANK YOU.

926
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
>> WITHOUT QUESTION.

927
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
>> AND AS YOU SAY, TAKE THE

928
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
POLITICS OUT OF IT.

929
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
IT'S A COMMONSENSE ISSUE, NOT A

930
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
LEFT/RIGHT ISSUE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

931
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
MOST OF US CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE

932
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
HOW THIS CAN HAPPEN.

933
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
BUT SOME PEOPLE CAN BECAUSE THEY

934
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT BEFORE.

935
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
CNN'S JOSH LEVS TELLS US HOW

936
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
VICTIMS OF THE 1999 COLUMBINE

937
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
SHOOTING ARE REACTING TO THIS

938
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
HORROR.
>> MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER

939
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
THE WORLD ARE MOURNING FOR THE

940
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED IN

941
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
CONNECTICUT.
BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN GROUP OF

942
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, A VERY

943
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
SMALL GROUP, FORTUNATELY, THAT

944
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
CAN ASSOCIATE IN A WAY THAT MOST
OF US CANNOT IMAGINE.

945
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT

946
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
IT'S LIKE TO BE AT SCHOOL WHEN A

947
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
TYPICAL DAY TURNS INTO CARNAGE.

948
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
SOME OF THEM ARE SURVIVORS OF

949
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
THE COLUMBINE MASSACRE 14 YEARS

950
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
AGO, SOME OF WHOM ARE NOW

951
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
PARENTS THEMSELVES.

952
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I SPOKE WITH ONE WHO'S NOW A

953
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
MOM, CASEY JOHNSON.

954
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
>> YOU LOSE THE SENSE THAT

955
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
THINGS COULD NEVER HAPPEN TO

956
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
YOU.
SO MANY PARENTS WOULD SAY, THIS

957
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AT MY CHILD'S

958
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
SCHOOL.

959
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
FOR ME AS A PARENT OF A CHILD, I

960
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
BELIEVE THIS COULD EASILY HAPPEN

961
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
AT MY CHILD'S SCHOOL BECAUSE

962
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
THAT'S BECAUSE IT HAS HAPPENED

963
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
TO ME BEFORE.

964
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I WOULD HOPE THAT THE PEOPLE

965
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
INVOLVED WILL WALK BESIDE THESE

966
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES FOR

967
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
THE YEARS TO COME.

968
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
THEY HAVE YEARS AND YEARS OF

969
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
HEALING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

970
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
FACING.

971
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN COME

972
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
BESIDE THEM AND ENCOURAGE THEM

973
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
AND FOCUS POSITIVELY ON THE

974
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
LIVES OF THE ONES THAT WERE
LOST.

975
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
>> I WANT YOU TO MEAT SHAWN

976
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
GRAVES.
SHAWN WAS SHOT SIX TIMES AT

977
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
COLUMBINE.
HE ENDED UP SPENDING MORE THAN A

978
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
YEAR IN A WHEELCHAIR.

979
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
TO THIS DAY, HE HAS SOME PAIN

980
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
BECAUSE OF IT.

981
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I SPOKE WITH HIM ABOUT HOW THE

982
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
NEWS FROM CONNECTICUT IS

983
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
AFFECTING HIM.

984
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
>> I LIVE WITH PAIN PHYSICALLY

985
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
ON A DAILY BASIS BECAUSE OF THE

986
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
INJURIES THAT I SUSTAINED.

987
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
BUT LOOKING BACK THEN, I TRY NOT

988
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

989
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
BUT WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS
HAPPENS, THAT'S THE FIRST THING

990
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
YOU DO.

991
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
YOU BEGIN TO RELIVE IT.

992
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
AND TURNING IT ON TO THE --

993
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
PUTTING ON THE NEWS AND JUST

994
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
WATCHING THE COVERAGE LIVE FROM

995
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
THIS POINT OF VIEW VERSUS WHERE

996
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I WAS THEN, IT WILL TAKE YOU

997
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
THROUGH AN EMOTIONAL TOLL,

998
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
THAT'S FOR SURE.

999
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
>> AND A LOT OF THE SURVIVORS OF

1000
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
COLUMBINE WERE ACTUALLY REACHING

1001
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
OUT TO FAMILIES IN CONNECTICUT,

1002
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
SOME OF THEM HAVE FORMED A GROUP

1003
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
NOW THAT REACH OUT TO FAMILIES

1004
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
AFTER MASS SHOOTINGS AND THEY

1005
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
ARE JUST AMONG THE MANY AROUND

1006
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
THE WORLD WHO ARE MOURNING IN

>> JOSH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1012
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
LET'S NOT FORGET THE FIRST

1013
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
VICTIM OF THIS TRAGEDY HERE IN

1014
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
NEWTOWN, THE MOTHER OF THE

1015
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
SHOOTER.

NEXT, MORE ABOUT HER AND THE

1017
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
WEAPONS THAT ENDED UP IN THE

1018
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
HANDS OF HER TROUBLED SON.

1019
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Capella University understands
rough economic times

1020
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
have led to an increase in
clinical depression.

1021
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Drug and alcohol abuse is up.

1022
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And those dealing with grief
don't have access to the

1023
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
professional help they need.

1024
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
When you see these issues, do
you want to walk away or
step up?

1025
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
With a degree in the field of
Counseling or Psychology from

1026
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000

the knowledge to make

others.

ONLY APPLY TO THOSE MAKING $1

1104
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
LEARNING MORE EACH DAY THAT MAY

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
EXPLAIN WHAT LED 20-YEAR-OLD

00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
ATTACK ON YOUNG CHILDREN AND

1108
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
ADULTS AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1109
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000

SECONDARILY AT IF SECONDARY

1112
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
CRIME SCENE THAT WE DISCUSSED

1113
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
WHERE THE FEMALE WAS LOCATED

1114
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
DECEASED, DID PRODUCE SOME VERY

1115
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
GOOD EVIDENCE IN THIS

1116
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
INVESTIGATION THAT OUR

1117
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
INVESTIGATORS WILL BE ABLE TO

1118
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
USE IN HOPEFULLY PAINTING THE

1119
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
COMPLETE PICTURE AS TO HOW AND

1120
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
MORE IMPORTANTLY WHY THIS

1121
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
OCCURRED.

1122
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
>> Reporter: POLICE WON'T SAY
THAT WHAT EVIDENCE IS.

1123
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
HOWEVER, INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN

1124
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
CHECKING OUT GUN RANGES AND

1125
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
SPORTING GOODS STORES.

1126
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
THEY FOLLOWED A LEAD THE SHOOTER

1127
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
TRIED TO BUY A GUN TUESDAY AT

1128
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
THIS LOCATION.

1129
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
AFTER SEARCHING STORE

1130
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
SURVEILLANCE VIDEOS, THE TIP

1131
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
DIDN'T PAN OUT.

1132
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
>> TO DATE, ATF HAS NOT

1133
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
UNCOVERED ANY INFORMATION THAT

1134
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
WOULD SUBSTANTIATE THE FACT THAT

1135
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
HE TRIED TO ACQUIRE GUNS

1136
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
RECENTLY.

1137
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
WE'RE ACTIVELY INVESTIGATING.

1138
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
>> Reporter: FEDERAL GUN AGENTS

1139
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
ALSO SAID THEY RECOVERED WEAPONS

1140
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
AT THE HOME THE SHOOTER SHARED

1141
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
FROM WIZ MOTHER.

1142
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
SOURCES SAY THREE MORE GUNS WERE

1143
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
FOUND.

1144
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
THESE THREE RIFLE MODELS, ALL

1145
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
OLDER ARE BEING TRACED.

1146
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
AT LEAST ONE HAS BEEN CONNECTED
TO THE MOTHER.

1147
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
THREE MORE WEAPONS WERE

1148
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
DISCOVERED WITH THE SHOOTER IN A
CLASSROOM WHERE HE TOOK HIS OWN

1149
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
LIFE.

1150
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
ACCORDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

1151
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
OFFICIALS, THE TWO HANDGUNS AND

1152
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC LONG GUN CALLED A

1153
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
BUSHMASTER WERE BOUGHT LEGALLY

1154
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
BY HIS MOTHER.

1155
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER SAYS

1156
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
THAT LONG GUN WAS USED TO KILL

1157
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
SEVERAL VICTIMS.

1158
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
>> I ONLY DID SEVEN OF THE

1159
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
AUTOPSIES.

1160
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
THE VICTIMS I HAD RANGED FROM

1161
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
THREE TO 11 WOUNDS APIECE.

1162
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I ONLY SAW TWO OF THEM WITH

1163
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
POSTRANGE SHOOTING.

1164
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
ALL THE WOUNDS THAT I KNOW OF AT

1165
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
THIS POINT WERE CAUSED BY THE

1166
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
LONG WEAPON.

1167
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
>> Reporter: ONE RELATIVE

1168
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
DESCRIBES THE SHOOTER AS BEING A

1169
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
VERY BRIGHT YOUNG MAN WHO AT

1170
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
TIMES WAS HOMESCHOOLED BY HIS
MOTHER.

1171
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL TELLS

1172
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
US THAT HIS OLDER BROTHER SAYS

1173
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
THAT HIS YOUNGER BROTHER WAS

1174
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
AUTIST

1175
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
AUTISTIC.
BUT SO FAR, NOTHING ADDS UP TO A

1176
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
MOTIVE.

1177
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN, NEWTOWN,
CONNECTICUT.

1178
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
>> THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER HAS

1179
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
EMERGED AS ONE OF THE MORE

1180
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
MYSTERIOUS FIGURES IN THE

1181
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
INVESTIGATION.

1182
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
HER SON APPARENTLY USED ONE OF

1183
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
HER OWN GUNS TO KILL HER.

1184
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
BUT THERE'S STILL SO MUCH WE

1185
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
DON'T KNOW ABOUT HER.

1186
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
CNN'S DAVID ARIOSTO JOINS US NOW

1187
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
WITH WHAT'S NEW ON THIS.

1188
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
DAVID, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT

1189
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
NANCY LANZA?

1190
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
>> RIGHT HERE, WE'RE HERE IN

1191
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
FRONT OF NANCY LANZA'S HOUSE.

1192
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
IT'S A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN
THE ROAD.

1193
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
WE'VE BEEN DIGGING ON THAT VERY

1194
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
QUESTION.
IT'S AN INCOMPLETE PICTURE AS TO

1195
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
WHO THIS WOMAN REALLY WAS.

1196
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
WE SPOKE WITH NEIGHBORS IN THE
AREA HERE.

1197
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
MANY OF THEM HAVE RECALLED A

1198
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
PERSON WHO IS A VERY PLEASANT

1199
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
PERSON TO TALKING WITH, LOVED

1200
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
GARDENING, LOVED LANDSCAPING.

1201
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
WOULD OFTEN ATTEND THESE SORT OF

1202
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
DICE GAME, LADIES NIGHT

1203
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
GET-TOGETHERS EVERY SO OFTEN,
PERHAPS EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS.

1204
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
SHE WAS THE KIND OF WOMAN THAT

1205
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
SORT OF LEANED ON HER NEIGHBORS

1206
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
BUT WAS ONLY REALLY FAMILIAR

1207
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
WITH SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS IN

1208
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY.

1209
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
YOU KIND OF THINK OF YOUR OWN

1210
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
NEIGHBORHOOD AND HOW MANY
NEIGHBORS YOU ACTUALLY KNOW

1211
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
OUTSIDE THOSE INITIAL FEW

1212
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
BLOCKS.

1213
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
SO THE NEIGHBORS THAT WE DID GET

1214
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
TO SPEAK WITH DID GET TO KNOW

1215
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
NANCY, BUT IT'S REALLY NOT ALL

1216
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
THAT CLEAR WHAT WAS BEHIND THE

1217
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
SCENES.
SHE MOVED HERE IN 1998 WITH HER

1218
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
HUSBAND.
THEY HAD TWO BOYS.

1219
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
SHE LATER DIVORCED AND RAISED

1220
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
HER TWO BOYS IN THIS AREA.

1221
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
WHAT TRANSPIRED LATER, HOWEVER,

1222
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
IS REALLY SOMEWHAT UNCLEAR

1223
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
BECAUSE THERE'S THIS OTHER SIDE

1224
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
TO NANCY.

1225
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
SHE HAD SEVERAL GUNS AND ONE

1226
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
INDIVIDUAL THAT I SPOKE TO, A

1227
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
BUSINESS OWNER, SAID THAT AT ONE

1228
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
POINT SHE EVEN BRANDISHED A

1229
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
RIFLE THAT SHE HAD RECENTLY

1230
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
PURCHASED.
THIS INDIVIDUAL ALSO SAID THAT

1231
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
SHE WOULD GO TARGET SHOOTING.

1232
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THAT OCCURRED

1233
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
AT A RANGE OR JUST AROUND ON

1234
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
CERTAIN TREES OR WHAT ACTUALLY

1235
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
HE MEANT BY THAT.

1236
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
BUT THEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ATF

1237
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
AND FBI OFFICIALS SAID

1238
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
ESSENTIALLY THAT WASN'T THE

1239
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
CASE.

1240
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
THEY WEREN'T AT A SHOOTING

1241
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
RANGE.
THAT DIDN'T OCCUR.

1242
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
BUT REALLY WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

1243
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
HERE ARE TRYING TO GET ANSWERS

1244
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
TO IS JUST WHAT MOTIVATED HER

1245
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
SON TO DO THIS?

1246
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
WHAT TRANSPIRED INSIDE THE

1247
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
HOUSE -- AND THERE'S A LOT OF

1248
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
PEOPLE REALLY REELING FROM THIS

1249
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
AND LEFT WITH THIS SORT OF A

1250
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
SPEECHLESS QUALITY ABOUT IT,
EVEN A DAY AFTER.

1251
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I KNOW MYSELF, I WENT DOWN TO

1252
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
THE FIREHOUSE JUST YESTERDAY AS

1253
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
FAMILIES WERE COMING OUT OF THIS

1254
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
FIREHOUSE THAT WAS MEANT TO BE A

1255
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
WEIGH STATION.

1256
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
AND TOWARD THE EARLY MORNING

1257
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
HOURS OF THAT TUMULTUOUS DAY,

1258
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
YOU'D SEE FAMILIES WALKING OUT

1259
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
WITH LOVED ONES, CHILDREN WHO

1260
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
WERE TEARY-EYED, SHAKEN BUT

1261
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
CLEARLY THEY WERE WALKING OUT

1262
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

1263
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
AND AS THE DAY PROGRESSED, THESE

1264
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
FAMILIES WOULD WALK OUT

1265
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
CHILDLESS.
AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THESE

1266
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
THINGS THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

1267
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
AN EASY END EVEN AS THE DAYS --

1268
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
>> AND DAVID, CLEARLY IT BREAKS

1269
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
YOUR HEART.

1270
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
AS YOU SAID, THERE ARE A LOT OF

1271
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.

1272
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
THERE WERE SOME INITIAL REPORTS

1273
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
THAT SHE, NANCY LANZA,

1274
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
ORIGINALLY WORKED FOR THE

1275
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
SCHOOL.
BUT THAT ISN'T TRUE, IS IT?

1276
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
>> A LOT OF INFORMATION COMING

1277
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
IN FROM ALL ANGLES HERE THAT WE

1278
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
GET IN.
IT SEEMS CREDIBLE.

1279
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
AND THEN IT TURNS OUT NOT TO BE
THE CASE.

1280
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
THERE WERE SOME INITIAL LOCAL

1281
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
REPORTS THAT INDICATED THAT SHE

1282
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
MIGHT HAVE WORKED IN THE SCHOOL

1283
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
SYSTEM.

1284
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
WHAT WE LATER FOUND OUT IS THAT

1285
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
SHE ACTUALLY HAD A BACKGROUND IN

1286
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
FINANCE AND HAD TAKEN SOME TIME

1287
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
OFF AND WAS STAYING HERE.

1288
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
WHAT HER CONNECTION WAS TO THE

1289
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
SCHOOL IS UNCLEAR.

1290
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
IF THERE'S ANY, WHICH ALSO

1291
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
RAISES MORE QUESTIONS AS TO WHY

1292
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
HER SON CHOSE THIS SCHOOL TO GO

1293
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
IN AND COMMIT THIS HEINOUS ACT.

1294
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
>> DAVID ARIOSTO, THANK YOU VERY

1295
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
MUCH FOR YOUR REPORTING.

1296
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
WE KNOW THE SHOOTER HAD THREE

1297
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
GUNS WITH HIM INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

1298
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
THOSE GUNS WERE REGISTERED TO

1299
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
HIS MOTHER.

1300
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW HE GOT
THEM.

1301
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
SO CAN ANYONE BE HELD

1302
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DEADLY

1303
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
ATTACK?

1304
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
KAREN CONTI IS A TRIAL ATTORNEY

1305
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
IN CHICAGO.

1306
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
CAN WE EXPECT LAWSUITS TO BE

1307
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
FILED AND AGAINST WHOM?

1308
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
>> LAWSUITS GET FILED FOR A LOT

1309
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
OF REASONS OTHER THAN MONEY

1310
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY MONEY DOESN'T

1311
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
REPLACE CHILDREN.

1312
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE FILE LAWSUITS TO

1313
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
GET INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN'T

1314
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
OTHERWISE GET THROUGH THE

1315
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
AUTHORITIES.
SOMETIMES THEY JUST WANT TO

1316
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
BLAME SOMEONE FOR AND HOLD

1317
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
SOMEONE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE

1318
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
SENSELESS VIOLENCE.

1319
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
AND SOMETIMES THEY JUST WANT TO

1320
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
CHANGE THINGS IN THE FUTURE,

1321
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
MAYBE CHANGE THE LAWS AND THE

1322
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
SAFETY PROCEDURES.

1323
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
SO JUST A NOTE ABOUT THAT, THE

1324
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
PARENTS WHO ARE ANGRY AND UPSET

1325
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
ABOUT THESE THINGS WILL BRING

1326
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
LAWSUITS.

1327
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
NOW, I JUST DON'T SEE A VIABLE

1328
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
LAWSUIT HERE BECAUSE WHO ARE YOU

1329
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
GOING TO SUE?

1330
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
THE SCHOOL SEEMED LIKE THEY DID

1331
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
A GREAT JOB, THEY HAD THE

1332
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
PRECAUTIONS IN PLACE.

1333
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
THIS WAS AN ADULT PERSON WHO DID

1334
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
THIS.
YOU CAN'T HOLD THE PARENTS

1335
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
RESPONSIBLE.

1336
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I DON'T REALLY SEE A VALID

1337
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
LAWSUIT.
>> YEAH.

1338
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION

1339
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
BECAUSE THE LEGAL DEFENSE HERE

1340
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
WOULD BE THE FACT THAT THE

1341
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
SUSPECT IS OVER THE AGE OF 18.

1342
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
HE IS AN ADULT.

1343
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
THEREFORE, HE'S THE ONLY ONE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS.

1344
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
BUT THEY WERE NOT HIS GUNS.

1345
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
MAYBE HE SHOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN

1346
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
ACCESS TO THE GUNS.

1347
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
BUT THE PERSON THE GUNS BELONGED

1348
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
TO IS NOW DECEASED.

1349
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1350
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE

1351
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
FAMILIES COULDN'T SUE THE ESTATE

1352
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
OF THE MOTHER.

1353
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PROVE

1354
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
THAT SHE IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR

1355
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
FORM KNEW THAT HE HAD THE

1356
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
PROPENSITY TO DO THIS AND THIS

1357
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
INDIVIDUAL HAD ASPERGER'S

1358
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
SYNDROME, WHICH IS A FORM OF
AUTISM.

1359
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
BUT IT HAS NO RELATION TO

1360
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
VIOLATION.

1361
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
BUT IF SHE HAD PRIOR

1362
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
KNOWLEDGE -- BUT EVEN THAT IS

1363
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
VERY TENUOUS.

1364
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
>> IN OREGON, WE SAW THE GUNS

1365
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
BEING STOLEN.
E WITH SAW HERE THE GUNS

1366
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
BELONGEDED TO THE MOTHER AND HE

1367
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
GOT ACCESS TO THE GUN.

1368
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE SOME

1369
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
CHANGES IN THE LAW HERE BECAUSE

1370
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
OF WHAT HAPPENED?

1371
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
>> I THINK WHAT WE SAW IN

1372
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
CONNECTICUT IS JUST PRIOR TO

1373
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
THIS, AFTER THE AURORA,

1374
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
COLORADO, THEATER SHOOTING, THEY

1375
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
TRIED TO CHANGE THE LAWS AND

1376
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE STRINGENT.

1377
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
BUT THERE WAS SUCH PROTEST THAT

1378
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
IT ALL GOT STRICKEN DOWN.

1379
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I DO SEE, THOUGH, THAT WE HAVE A

1380
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
LAW IN ILLINOIS CALLED THE

1381
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
ILLINOIS SCHOOL SAFETY DRILL ACT

1382
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
WHICH REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO

1383
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
ANNUALLY HAVE DRILLS TO KIND OF

1384
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
PREPARE FOR NOT ONLY THESE KINDS

1385
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
OF THINGS BUT WEATHER ISSUES,

1386
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
TORNADOES, FIRES AND THE LIKE,

1387
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
EVACUATION PROCEDURES IN PLACE,
P.A. SYSTEMS, ET CETERA.

1388
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE A

1389
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
MASSIVE AMOUNT OF LEGISLATION

1390
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY REQUIRING

1391
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
SCHOOLS TO DO THIS.

1392
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
>> KAREN CONTI, THANK YOU.

1393
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
EARLIER ONE OF THE MOST

1394
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
COMPELLING MOMENTS OF THIS

1395
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
TRAGEDY, A FATHER WHO LOST HIS
DAUGHTER IN THE SHOOTING,

1396
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
BRAVELY TELLS THE WORLD ABOUT

1397
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
THE LITTLE GIRL THAT NOT ONLY HE

1398
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
LOST BUT ONE OF THE MANY THAT WE

1399
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
ALL LOST.

00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
HELD TOMORROW EVENING.

1445
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
THE SHOOTER'S FATHER, PETER

1446
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
LANZA, ISSUED A STATEMENT

1447
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
TONIGHT OFFERING HIS CONDOLENCES

1448
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
TO THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES.

1449
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
AND WE HAVE LEARNED MORE ABOUT

1450
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
THE VICTIMS INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

1451
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
SIX WOMEN AND 20 STUDENTS DIED

1452
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
THERE.

1453
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
12 GIRLS, EIGHT BOYS, ALL 6 OR 7

1454
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
YEARS OLD.

1455
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
THE STATE'S CHIEF MEDICAL

1456
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
EXAMINER SAYS ALL OF THEM DIED

1457
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
FROM GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

1458
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE

1459
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
NOW TRYING TO EMOTIONALLY HANDLE

1460
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
THIS TRAGEDY, FRIENDS, FAMILY

1461
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
AND RESIDENTS OF NEWTOWN,

1462
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
CONNECTICUT, TRYING TO START

1463
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
DOWN THAT ROAD TO RECOVERY RIGHT

1464
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
NOW.
OUR DR. SANJAY GUPTA VISITED A

1465
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
GRIEF CENTER TODAY AND HE TALKED
TO SOME OF THEM.

1466
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
LISTEN TO WHAT HE TOLD ANDERSON
EARLIER.

1467
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
>> WHEN WE GOT THERE, THERE WERE

1468
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
LITERALLY 100 CARS IN THE

1469
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
PARKING LOT.

1470
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
WE WEREN'T FILMING ANYTHING OUT

1471
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
OF RESPECT FOR PEOPLE'S PRIVACY.

1472
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
BUT PEOPLE WERE WALKING OUT WITH

1473
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
CHILDREN, PROBABLY CHILDREN FROM

1474
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
THE SCHOOL, A LOT OF PARENTS

1475
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
WALKING WITH THEM INTO THE

1476
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
SCHOOL.
AND THERE WERE PSYCHIATRISTS,

1477
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS, CHILDREN'S
COUNSELORS IN THE SCHOOL.

1478
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I THINK WHAT WAS STRIKING IS

1479
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
PEOPLE WERE GOING IN AND THEY

1480
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
WERE STAYING IN FOR A LONG TIME.

1481
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
THIS WAS SORT OF A GRIEVING BUT

1482
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
ALSO HEALING GOING ON.

1483
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
ALSO THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT THE

1484
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
COMMUNITY WAS SORT OF AN
INDIVIDUAL, MEANING THAT YOU SAW

1485
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
THAT SOMEONE ELSE WAS GOING

1486
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
THROUGH THE SAME THING YOU WERE.

1487
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
AND PEOPLE WERE BEING COMFORTED

1488
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
BY THAT IN SOME WAY.

1489
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
>> IT'S INTERESTING.

1490
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I WAS TALKING TO MY MOM WHO LOST

1491
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
A SON, MY BROTHER.

1492
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
AND SHE WAS SAYING FOR HER, IT

1493
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
HELPED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

1494
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
AND I'VE HEARD THAT FROM A LOT

1495
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
OF PEOPLE HERE, THAT IT HELPS TO

1496
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
TALK.
AND YET OTHER PEOPLE KIND OF

1497
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
AREN'T READY TO TALK ABOUT IT OR

1498
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT AT THIS

1499
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
POINT.
>> YEAH.

1500
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I THINK THE TIMING SEEMS TO BE

1501
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE

1502
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
WHICH IS WHY I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

1503
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
TO EXPECT WHEN I WENT TO THAT

1504
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
CRISIS CENTER TODAY.

1505
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THIS COMMUNITY

1506
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
FOR THE MOST PART IS READY TO

1507
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
TALK.

1508
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SMALL SAMPLE

1509
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
SIZE.
BUT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT.

1510
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
AND THE FEELING OF ISOLATION,

1511
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
THINKING THAT I'M GOING THROUGH

1512
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
THIS ALONE, THAT NO ONE QUITE

1513
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
UNDERSTANDS WHAT THIS HAS DONE

1514
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
TO ME CAN BE QUITE PAINFUL AND

1515
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
QUITE DAMAGING LONG TERM AS
WELL.

1516
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
IF YOU SEE OTHER PEOPLE GOING

1517
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
THROUGH IT -- EVEN JUST BEING

1518
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
THERE IN THE CRISIS CENTER WITH

1519
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
OTHER PEOPLE, I THINK, SEEMED TO

1520
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
BE THERAPEUTIC FOR THEM.

1521
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
>> AND A LOT OF PARENTS HERE AND

1522
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
AROUND THE WORLD ARE TRYING TO

1523
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
FIGURE OUT HOW TO TALK TO THEIR

1524
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
KIDS ABOUT IT.

1525
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I TALKED TO SOME PARENTS LAST

1526
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
NIGHT WHOSE KIDS WERE IN THE

1527
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
SCHOOL AND THANKFULLY HAD

1528
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
SURVIVED.
AND THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE

1529
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
WAITING FOR THEIR CHILD TO KIND

1530
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
OF BRING IT UP TO THEM.

1531
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
AND THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT.

1532
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
>> YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THEY

1533
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
KNOW.

1534
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
OBVIOUSLY THE CHILDREN IN THE

1535
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
SCHOOL KNOW.

1536
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
BUT EVEN OTHER CHILDREN IN THE

1537
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
COMMUNITY KNOW, EVEN IF THEY

1538
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
HAVEN'T BEEN WATCHING TELEVISION

1539
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
JUST IN TODAY'S DAY AND AGE.

1540
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
THE THING THAT KEEPS COMING BACK

1541
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
IS THEY SORT OF DIRECT THE

1542
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
CONVERSATION.
SO YOU SORT OF GET YOUR OWN

1543
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
FEELINGS IN CHECK FIRST AS AN

1544
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
ADULT OR AS A PARENT.

1545
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
AND THEN YOU FILL IN DETAILS AS

1546
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
APPROPRIATE, AS AGE APPROPRIATE,

1547
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
LEAVING OUT OBVIOUSLY GRAPHIC

1548
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
DETAILS.
BUT THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT YOU

1549
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
DON'T WANT TO BE FALSE OR YOU

1550
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
WANT TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT IN

1551
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
TERMS OF WHAT YOU TELL THEM -- I

1552
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH MY

1553
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
DAUGHTER.

1554
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
SHE STARTED ASKING ABOUT SOME OF

1555
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
THE NAMES OF THE CHILDREN.

1556
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THEY

1557
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
IMMEDIATELY WANT TO HUMANIZE

1558
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
THIS IN SOME WAY FOR THEMSELVES.

1559
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
IT'S A TOUGH CONVERSATION TO

1560
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
HAVE.

1561
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
SHE WANTED TO KNOW IF HER SCHOOL

1562
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
WAS GOING TO BE SAFE.

1563
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I HAD TO SAY, LOOK, DADDY'S

1564
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
SCHOOL NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN TO

1565
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
HIM.

1566
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
MOMMY'S SCHOOL NEVER HAD IT

1567
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
HAPPEN TO HER.
BUT THIS OBVIOUSLY HAPPENED.

1568
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
WE DO THE BEST WE CAN TO KEEP

1569
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
YOU SAFE.

1570
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
IT'S TOUGH BUT AN IMPORTANT

1571
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
CONVERSATION.

1572
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
>> AND ONE FATHER REFUSES TO

1573
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
THINK OF HIS DAUGHTER AS JUST

1574
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
THE VICTIM OF A HORRIBLE CRIME.

1575
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
THIS IS HOW ROBBIE PARKER SAYS

1576
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
HE'LL REMEMBER HIS 6-YEAR-OLD

1577
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
LITTLE GIRL.

1578
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
>> I'D REALLY LIKE TO OFFER OUR
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO THE

1579
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
FAMILIES WHO WERE DIRECTLY

1580
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
AFFECTED BY THIS SHOOTING.

1581
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
IT'S AN HORRIFIC TRAGEDY AND WE

1582
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT OUR

1583
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO OUT TO

1584
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
THEM.

1585
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
THIS INCLUDES THE FAMILY OF THE
SHOOTER.

1586
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD THIS

1587
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
EXPERIENCE MUST BE FOR YOU AND I

1588
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR FAMILY

1589
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
AND OUR LOVE AND OUR SUPPORT

1590
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
GOES OUT TO YOU AS WELL.

1591
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
MY DAUGHTER, EMILIE, WOULD BE

1592
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE

1593
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
STANDING AND GIVING HER LOVE AND

1594
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
SUPPORT TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS

1595
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF

1596
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
PERSON THAT SHE IS, NOT BECAUSE

1597
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
OF ANY PARENTING THAT MY WIFE

1598
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
AND I COULD HAVE DONE, BUT

1599
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE GIFTS

1600
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY HER

1601
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
HEAVENLY FATHER.

1602
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I HAVE TWO REALLY GOOD FRIENDS

1603
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
AT HOME WHO HAVE SET UP A

1604
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
FACEBOOK PAGE TO HELP RAISE
MONEY FOR EMILIE.

1605
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
WHEN I'VE GOTTEN ON THAT AND

1606
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
SEEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

1607
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
HAVE COMMENTED AND EXPRESSED

1608
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
THEIR CONDOLENCES, IT'S BEEN

1609
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
QUITE OVERWHELMING.

1610
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

1611
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

1612
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

1613
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

1614
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
WAS AND HOW MANY LIVES THAT SHE

1615
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
WAS ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT

1616
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
TIME HERE ON EARTH.

1617
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

1618
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
VERY LOVING.

1619
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
EMILIE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO TRY

1620
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
NEW THINGS, OTHER THAN FOOD.

1621
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
SHE LOVED TO USE HER TALENTS TO

1622
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
TOUCH THE LIVES OF EVERYONE THAT

1623
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
SHE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH.

1624
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
SHE WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL ARTIST

1625
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
AND SHE ALWAYS CARRIED AROUND

1626
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
HER MARKERS AND PENCILS SO SHE

1627
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
NEVER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO

1628
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
DRAW A PICTURE OR MAKE A CARD

1629
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
FOR THOSE AROUND HER.

1630
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF

1631
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
TIMES EMILIE NOTICED SOMEONE

1632
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
FEELING SAD OR FRUSTRATED AND

1633
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
WOULD RUSH TO FIND A PIECE OF

1634
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
PAPER TO DRAW THEM A PICTURE OR

1635
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
TO WRITE THEM AN ENCOURAGING

1636
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
NOTE.

1637
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
EMILIE'S CARD MAKING WAS

1638
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
EXPRESSED BEAUTIFULLY THIS LAST

1639
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
OCTOBER WHEN SHE PLACED A VERY

1640
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
SPECIAL CARD SHE HAD MADE INTO

1641
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
THE CASKET WITH HER GRANDPA, WHO

1642
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
ALSO JUST RECENTLY DIED OF A
TRAGIC ACCIDENT.

1643
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER TWO

1644
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
LITTLE SISTERS AND DELIGHTED IN

1645
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ, DANCE

1646
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS IN

1647
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
LIFE.

1648
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
EMILIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS

1649
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE

1650
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
PLEASURE TO MEET HER WOULD AGREE

1651
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
THAT THIS WORLD IS A BETTER
PLACE BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN IN IT.

1652
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
SHE WAS THEIR BEST FRIEND.

1653
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
THEY WERE ALL BORN WITHIN THREE

1654
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
YEARS OF EACH OTHER SO BY LAW,

1655
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE.

1656
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
SHE WAS TEACHING MY MIDDLE

1657
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
DAUGHTER TO READ.

1658
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
SHE WOULD HELP MY YOUNGEST

1659
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
DAUGHTER LEARN HOW TO MAKE

1660
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
THINGS, SHOW HER HOW TO DO

1661
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
CRAFTS.

1662
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
THEY LOOKED UP TO HER AND THEY

1663
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
LOOKED TO HER WHEN THEY NEEDED

1664
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
COMFORT.

1665
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
USUALLY THAT'S SAVED FOR A MOM

1666
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
AND A DAD.

1667
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
BUT IT WAS REALLY SWEET TO SEE

1668
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
THE TIMES WHEN ONE OF THEM WOULD

1669
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
FALL OR GET THEIR FEELINGS HURT,

1670
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
HOW THEY WOULD RUN TO EMILIE TO

1671
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
GET SUPPORT AND HUGS AND KISSES.

1672
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT

1673
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
COULD JUST LIGHT UP A ROOM.

1674
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING KIND TO

1675
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
SAY ABOUT ANYBODY.

1676
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
AND HER LOVE AND THE STRENGTH

1677
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
THAT SHE GAVE US AND THE EXAMPLE

1678
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
THAT SHE SHOWED TO US IS

1679
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
REMARKABLE.

1680
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON.

1681
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
AND I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER

1682
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
DAD.

1683
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I WAS LEAVING TO WORK AND SHE

1684
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT.

1685
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
AND I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TEACHING

1686
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
HER PORTUGUESE.

1687
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
SO OUR LAST CONVERSATION WAS IN

1688
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
PORTUGUESE.

1689
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
AND SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING.

1690
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

1691
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I SAID THAT I WAS DOING WELL.

1692
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME.

1693
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT

1694
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
THE DOOR.

1695
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
FREE AGENCY IS GIVEN TO ALL OF

1696
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
US TO ACT AND DO WHAT WE WANT.

1697
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM

1698
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
US.

1699
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

1700
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
THAT HE WAS GIVEN AND THAT'S

1701
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
WHAT HE CHOSE TO DO WITH IT.

1702
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I KNOW THAT GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT

1703
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
AWAY.

1704
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I'M NOT MAD BECAUSE I HAVE MY

1705
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
AGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT I USE

1706
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
THIS EVENT TO DO WHAT I CAN TO

1707
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
DO WHATEVER I CAN.
