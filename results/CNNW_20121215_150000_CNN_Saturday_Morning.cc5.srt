THE TRAGEDY AND SCOPE AND

68
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
MAGNITUDE OF THE TRAGEDY THAT

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

87
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
ANOTHER DETAIL THAT WE'RE
LEARNING FROM THIS IS THAT EACH

88
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
FAMILY, SOLEDAD, EACH VICTIM'S

89
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
FAMILY HAS BEEN ASSIGNED A

THE STATEMENT READS, TO

92
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000

THEY'RE REQUESTING THAT WE NOT

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
CALL THEM, NO PRESS INTERVIEWS

98
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
FROM THE FAMILY WHICH PROBABLY

99
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
EXPLAINS A LITTLE ABOUT THE

100
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
DIFFICULTY THAT WE'VE HAD ALL

101
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000

102
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
SECOND CRIME SCENE THERE IN

108
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000

114
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
SOLEDAD?
>> Reporter: THE BODIES HAVE

115
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
BEEN MOVED TO THE MORGUE.

116
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
IT WAS ONE OF THE MORE

117
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
DISTURBING DETAILS THAT WE GOT

118
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
YESTERDAY IN THE PRESS

119
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
CONFERENCE WHEN WE WERE TALKING

120
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
TO LIEUTENANT VANCE, THE ONE

121
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
WHO'S BEEN GIVING US THE BULK OF

122
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THE INFORMATION.

123
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
HE WAS TELLING US BECAUSE IT WAS

124
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
AN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE THAT ALL

125
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
THE BODIES WOULD REMAIN WHERE

126
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
THEY HAD FALLEN.

127
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
SO THAT IS A BIG STEP FORWARD I

128
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
GUESS IN THIS INVESTIGATION TO

129
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
AT LEAST HAVE THOSE BODIES MOVED

130
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000

131
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
OF KIN NOTIFIED AND HAVE I GUESS

132
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
CONFIRMATION FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE

133
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
STILL WONDERING THE VERY WORST

134
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
ABOUT THEIR LOVED ONES.

135
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
NICK VALENCIA WITH AN UPDATE FOR

136
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
US THIS MORNING.

137
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THANK YOU, WE APPRECIATE IT.

138
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN THAT LATEST

139
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
RELEASE, THEY CONFIRMED WHAT

140
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
WE'RE CERTAIN TO KNOW.
OF COURSE WE'RE WAITING FOR THE

141
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
PRESS CONFERENCE.
THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE

142
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
DOING THE PRESS CONFERENCE

143
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
SOMETIME AFTER 10:00 EASTERN

144
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
TIME.
SO OBVIOUSLY AS THE MINUTES TICK

145
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
BY, THEY'RE NOW WAITING TO SEE

146
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
WHEN THEY'LL DO THAT.

147
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
LOTS OF QUESTIONS REMAIN.

148
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
WE'RE HOPING THEY CAN ANSWER

149
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
SOME QUESTIONS IN THE UPCOMING

150
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
PRESS CONFERENCE.

151
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
WHY WOULD THE SHOOTER COME TO AN

152
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

153
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
IT MAKES NO SENSE, IT REALLY

154
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
DOES BOGGLE THE MIND.

155
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHY ANYONE

156
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
WOULD TARGET SOME SMALL

157
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
CHILDREN.
IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

158
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
THE PARENTS WERE GOING THROUGH

159
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
AS THEY GOT A ROBO CALL TELLING

160
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
THEM TO COME TO THE SCHOOL.

161
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
THE SCHOOL HAD BEEN LOCKED DOWN.

162
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
TELLING THEM THAT THERE HAD BEEN

163
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
A SHOOTING.

164
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
CANNOT PUT YOUR MIND AROUND WHAT

165
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
PARENTS WERE THINKING AS THEY

166
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
PULLED UP TO THE SCHOOL.

167
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
THEY WOULD SEE AMBULANCES

168
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
STREAMING IN, AS WELL.

169
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
AND THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS HERE

170
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
AND THAT IT WAS VERY, VERY BAD.

171
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
AND CAN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT WHAT

172
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
IT WOULD MEAN TO TELL YOUR

173
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
CHILDREN THAT THEIR PRINCIPAL

174
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
HAS BEEN SHOT AND KILLED, AND

175
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST HAS BEEN

176
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
SHOT AND KILLED.

177
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF
THAT.

178
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
>> WHEN I SAW THOSE TEACHERS,

179
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
WHEN I FOUND THE TWO CHILDREN

180
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
AND -- WE'RE DEVASTATED AND

181
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
HEARTBROKEN FOR THE POOR

182
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
FAMILIES WHO DID NOT HAVE THAT

183
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
MOMENT IN THE FIRE HOUSE OF

184
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
FINDING THEIR CHILDREN.

185
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

186
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
AND OUR PRAYERS -- THE ENTIRE

187
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
COMMUNITY'S HEARTBROKEN.

188
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
WHEN I SAW THE TEACHERS AND

189
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
LOCKED EYES WITH EACH OF THEM

190
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
SEPARATELY, I FOUND THE TWO

191
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
CHILDREN, IF I COULD GO BACK, I

192
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
WOULD -- I WOULD EMBRACE THEM

193
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY

194
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
HAD GONE THROUGH.

195
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
BUT IT WAS -- IT WAS ACTUALLY

196
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
HANDLED VERY WELL BECAUSE I

197
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
CAN'T IMAGINE THE PANDEMONIUM

198
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GONE ON IN

199
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
THE FIRE HOUSE FROM THE PARENTS

200
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
SEARCHING FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

201
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
IF ANYBODY THERE HAD ANY IDEA OF

202
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
THE LEVEL OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED

203
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
YESTERDAY.
PEOPLE JUST SIMPLY DIDN'T KNOW

204
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
REALLY WHAT WAS GOING ON.

205
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
THEY JUST KNEW THAT THEIR

206
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
CHILDREN HAD BEEN IN A DANGEROUS

207
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
PLACE, AND THAT THEY -- THAT

208
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
THOSE THAT MADE IT TO THE FIRE

209
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
HOUSE WERE, THANK GOD, SAFE.

210
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
>> Reporter: WHAT WILL YOU TELL
YOUR SON WHO'S A FIRST GRADER?

211
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
WHAT WILL YOU TELL YOUR DAUGHTER

212
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
WHO'S A THIRD GRADER?

213
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
DO THEY HAVE ANY IDEA OF THE

214
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
SCOPE OF HOW BAD IT IS?

215
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THEY DO

216
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
MORE THAN THEY'RE LETTING ON.

217
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
WE HAVEN'T SAID MUCH, IT'S --

218
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
THIS IS SHOCKING.
SO WE'RE -- THIS IS NEW TO US.

219
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
AND WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO

220
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
TALK TO COUNSELORS TODAY OVER AT

221
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
THE REED SCHOOL.

222
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
WE'RE GOING TO LIVE AT OUR

223
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
CHURCH AT ST. ROSE AND LEARN

224
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
WHAT TO SAY BEFORE WE SAY IT.

225
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
IT'S REALLY TRICKY.

226
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
AND FOR MY THIRD GRADER, LITTLE

227
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
BITS AND PIECES ARE COMING OUT

228
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
NOW.
>> Reporter: SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S

229
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
NOT TALKING AS MUCH ABOUT IT.

230
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
>> NO.

231
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
LITTLE THINGS ARE COMING OUT NOW

232
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
WHERE SHE -- SHE HEARD A LOT.

233
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
THEY ALL HEARD AND SAW THINGS

234
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THAT OUR CHILDREN SHOULD NOT

235
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
HEAR OR SEE.

236
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
THEY KNOW THAT IT WAS A BAD MAN.

237
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
AND WE SAID WE'RE JUST COMING TO

238
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
TALK TO PEOPLE.
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

239
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
AT SANDY HOOK.

240
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
THEY DON'T KNOW -- THEY DON'T

241
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
KNOW THAT THEY'VE LOST THEIR

242
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
FRIENDS, THEIR PRINCIPAL.

243
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
>> IT'S BECOME APPARENT THAT OUR

244
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
6-YEAR-OLD HAS LOST CLOSE

245
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
FRIEN
FRIENDS.

246
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
HE'S VERY UNAWARE OF THAT NOW.

247
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO

248
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
APPROACH IT WITH HIM AT THIS

249
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
POINT.
WE'RE GUARDING HIM FROM THE TV.

250
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
WHEN THEY FELL ASLEEP LAST NIGHT

251
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
AND THE EXPERTS WOULD COME ON

252
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
THE TV TO DISCUSS HOW TO TALK TO

253
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
YOUR CHILDREN, WE WERE

254
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
ATTENTIVE, LET'S LISTEN OR WATCH

255
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THIS.

256
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
AND WE REALIZED WATCHING IT, IT

257
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH US, HAD

258
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE REST

259
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
OF THE COUNTRY WATCHING IT, BUT

260
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
NOT THE PEOPLE INVOLVED, THE

261
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL.

262
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO, WE

263
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
REALIZE AS THIS GOES ON, THAT WE

264
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

265
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
COUNSELING.
>> Reporter: YEAH, MANY PEOPLE

266
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
-- SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SENT

267
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
MESSAGES TO ME TO TELL PEOPLE

268
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
LIKE YOU AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

269
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
LOST THEIR CHILDREN.

270
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
JUST HOW SORRY THEY FEEL FOR

271
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
THEM.
>> YEAH.
I MEAN, YOUR HEART -- THIS IS A

272
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
FEELING, IT IS UNSPEAKABLE.

273
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
IT IS LIKE REACHING INTO YOUR

274
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
INSIDES AND PULLING THEM OUT.

275
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I MEAN, WHEN THINGS HAPPEN TO

276
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
YOUR CHILDREN AND TO OTHER

277
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
PEOPLE'S CHILDREN -- I CAN'T

278
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
LOOK AT MY CHILDREN'S FACES NOW

279
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
WITHOUT SEEING THE FACES OF

280
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
EVERY ONE OF THEIR SCHOOLMATES

281
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
AND ALL OF THEIR FRIENDS AND

282
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE DOING

283
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
RIGHT NOW OR SAYING OR TALKING

284
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
ABOUT CHRISTMAS.

285
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'M THINKING, YOUR FRIENDS

286
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
SHOULD ALL BE HERE.

287
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
AND IT'S JUST -- IT IS SUCH --

288
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
IT IS SO HEAVY, SO HEAVY ON YOUR

289
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
HEART.
>> Reporter: THE NATION FEELS

290
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
THAT WAY, TOO.

291
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
>> YEAH.
THE OUTPOURING OF LOVE HAS BEEN

292
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
TREMENDOUS.
I MEAN, PEOPLE ARE CALLING FROM

293
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

294
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
WE'RE GOING TO NEED THAT NOW.

295
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
WE'RE GOING TO ABSOLUTELY NEED

296
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
THAT TO BE THERE AS A COMMUNITY.

297
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
WE LOVE SANDY HOOK.
THIS IS SUCH A GREAT PLACE.

298
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
AND THE PEOPLE ARE WONDERFUL.

299
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO

300
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
REALLY EMBRACE EACH OTHER AND

301
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
OPEN OUR HEARTS AND OPEN OUR

302
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
ARMS AND OPEN THE CHURCH DOORS

303
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
AND GET EVERYBODY PRAYING AND

304
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
TOGETH

305
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
TOGETHER.

306
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE
WILL GET THROUGH.

307
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SOMETHING

308
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
WE WILL EVER, EVER GET OVER.

309
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
>> I WOULD LIKE -- I WOULD LIKE

310
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
ALSO TO SAY THAT WE ALWAYS FELT

311
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
BLESSED THAT OUR CHILDREN WERE

312
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
AT SANDY HOOK SCHOOL.

313
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
IT WAS AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL

314
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
SCHOOL, FANTASTIC EDUCATORS.

315
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
THE PRINCIPAL WHO, GOD BLESS

316
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
HER, LOFHE

317
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
HER, LOST HER LIFE WAS JUST A
VERY SPECIAL PERSON.

318
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
AND ALL THE PARENTS KNEW THAT.

319
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
SO IT'S A VERY -- IT'S SHOCKING

320
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
BEYOND BELIEF THAT THIS HAS

321
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
HAPPENED.

322
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
AND WE'RE JUST GRIEF STRICKEN.

323
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
HEARTBROKEN FOR THOSE FAMILIES.

324
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
>> Reporter: WE'RE GOING TO

325
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
CONTINUE TO TALK THROUGH TO SEE

326
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
PARENTS LIKE THE PHELPSES

327
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

328
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY STRUGGLING

329
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
WITH HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE
AND THE KIND OF HELP AND

330
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
ASSISTANCE THAT THEY NEED, AT

331
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
THE SAME TIME BEING VERY

332
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
GRATEFUL FOR THE OUTPOURING OF

333
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
SUPPORT THAT THEY HAVE FELT HERE

334
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
IN NEWTOWN FROM ALL THE PEOPLE

335
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
AROUND THE COUNTRY AND AROUND

336
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
THE WORLD WHO HAVE BEEN MAKING

337
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
THEIR CONDOLENCES WELL KNOWN.

338
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
AND OF COURSE WE'RE ALSO GOING

339
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE

340
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
OF GUN CONTROL IN THE COUNTRY,

341
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
FOR THE SECOND DAY IN A ROLE.

342
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
WE'

343
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
-- IN A ROW.

344
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
WE'RE HEARING PRESIDENT OBAMA
CALL FOR MEANINGFUL ACTION.

345
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT EXACTLY THAT

346
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
WOULD MEAN.

347
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT

348
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
BRIANNA KEILAR IS AT THE WHITE

349
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
HOUSE FOR US.
LAY OUT THERE FOR ME, YOU HAVE

350
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
POINTED OUT THAT THE PRESIDENT

351
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
HIMSELF HAS NOT DONE MUCH ON THE

352
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
ISSUE OF GUN CONTROL.

353
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
SO WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS OF

354
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
WHAT MEANINGFUL ACTION COULD

355
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
SPECIFICALLY MEAN?

356
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
>> Reporter: WELL, GUN CONTROL

357
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
ADVOCATES, SOLEDAD, THINK THAT

358
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
IT SHOULD MEAN FURTHER GUN

359
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
LEGISLATION.
THEY WANT TO SEE ACTION TAKEN.

360
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
THE THING, THOUGH, IS IT'S

361
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHAT PRESIDENT

362
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
OBAMA MEANS BY WHAT HE SAID

363
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
YESTERDAY IN THE BRIEFING ROOM,

364
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
AND HE REITERATED TODAY IN HIS

365
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
WEEKLY ADDRESS.
HE WANTS TO SEE MEANINGFUL

366
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
ACTION.
IF YOU GO BY HIS PAST, IN 2008

367
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
WHILE HE WAS CAMPAIGNING, HE

368
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
SAID HE WANTED TO SEE A RENEWAL

369
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
OF THE SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPON BAN.

370
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN THAT

371
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
EXPIRED IN 2004.

372
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
AND THERE WERE A LOT OF TRIES IN

373
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
CONGRESS TO RENEW THAT TO NO

374
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
AVAIL.
HE PROMISED THAT.

375
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING HE DIDN'T

376
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
DELIVER ON DURING HIS FIRST

377
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
TERM.
THE BRADY CAMPAIGN A COUPLE OF

378
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
YEARS AGO GIVING HIM AN "F" WHEN

379
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
IT COMES TO GUN CONTROL.

380
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I WAS WITH HIM IN JULY IN NEW

381
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
ORLEANS WHERE HE SPOKE TO THE
NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE A FEW DAYS

382
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
AFTER THE SHOOTING IN AURORA,

383
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
COLORADO.

384
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
HE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH

385
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
GUNS.
HE TALKED ABOUT HAVING A

386
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
CONVERSATION.

387
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
AND SO WHEN YOU READ BETWEEN THE

388
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
LINES THERE, IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE

389
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
THERE WAS A WHOLE LOT GOING ON

390
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
THERE CONCRETE.

391
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
THAT, OF COURSE, WAS AN ELECTION

392
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
YEAR, NOT A WHOLE LOT OF

393
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
APPETITE TO DO SOMETHING IN AN

394
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
ELECTION YEAR.
FRANKLY, WHEN IT COMES TO

395
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
CONGRESS, THERE OFTEN IS NOT AN

396
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
APPETITE TO DO SOMETHING ON GUN

397
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
CONTROL.

398
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

399
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
REPUBLICANS WHO TRADITIONALLY
ARE IN FAVOR OF GUN RIGHTS,

400
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
THERE ARE DEMOCRATS OPPOSED TO

401
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
GUN RIGHTS OPPOSED TO GUN

402
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
CONTROL, LEGISLATION THAT MAY

403
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
TIGHTEN RESTRICTIONS.

404
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
THAT'S EVEN THE CASE YOU MIGHT

405
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
SEE IN THE SENATE WHEN YOU'RE

406
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
TALKING ABOUT THE SENATE

407
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
MAJORITY LEADER, A DEMOCRAT,

408
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
HARRY REID, WHO COMES FROM

409
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
NEVADA.
WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW AT THIS

410
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
POINT EXACTLY WHAT MEANINGFUL

411
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
ACTION IS GOING TO MEAN.

412
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'LL BE

413
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT, GETTING

414
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
ANSWERS TO IN THE COMING DAYS.

415
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
CERTAINLY GUN-CONTROL ADVOCATES

416
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
WANT TO SEE MORE LEGISLATION.

417
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
>> Reporter: A RESOUNDING NO

418
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
COMMENT ESSENTIALLY FROM THE NRA

419
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
WHICH IS A VERY, VERY POSSIBLE

420
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
LOBBYIST, PROBABLY ANOTHER

421
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
POWERFUL LOBBY LOCATED IN

422
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, THE

423
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
NATIONAL SPORT SHOOTING

424
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
ASSOCIATION, AS WELL.

425
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
BOTH COMING FORWARD TODAY WITH

426
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
-- WITH NO COMMENT BASICALLY.

427
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
BRIANNA KEILAR FOR US, THANK YOU

428
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
VERY MUCH.
SOME ACTION TO MY LEFT HERE

429
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
WHICH IS GIVING ME A SENSE THAT

430
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
MAYBE THIS PRESS CONFERENCE IS A

431
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO GETTING

432
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
STARTED.

433
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'M SEEING FOLKS START TO RUN

434
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
ACROSS THIS PARKING LOT WHERE WE

435
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
ARE ALL KIND OF SET UP.

436
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
AND IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THEY'RE

437
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
KNEELING DOWN WHICH IS MAKING ME

438
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
THINK THAT MAYBE WE'RE GOING TO

439
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
HEAR IN A MOMENT FROM LIEUTENANT

440
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
VANCE.

441
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
HE IS WITH THE STATE POLICE, AND

442
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
HE'S BEEN THE GUY WHO'S BEEN

443
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
DOING THE BULK OF THE UPDATING

444
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE

445
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
AFTERMATH OF THIS TERRIBLE

446
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
SHOOTING.

447
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
NOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

448
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
KNOW ALREADY FROM A PRESS

449
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
RELEASE THAT THEY SENT OUT SORT

450
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
OF IN LIEU OF THIS 8:00 PRESS

451
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
CONFERENCE THAT NEVER HAPPENED,

452
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
THEY SAID THAT THE BODIES WERE

453
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
NOW OUT OF THE SCHOOL, THANK

454
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
GOD.
HAD BEEN MOVED TO A MORGUE.

455
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
WE KNOW THAT NEW YORK CITY HAD

456
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
SET UP A MOBILE MORGUE UNIT TO

457
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
COME AND HELP OUT IN THIS

458
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
TRAGEDY.
THE NEXT OF KIN WE WERE TOLD IN

459
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
THE PRESS RELEASE HAD ALREADY

460
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
BEEN NOTIFIED.

461
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
AND THAT A TROOPER WOULD BE

462
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
ASSIGNED TO EVERY FAMILY THAT

463
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
LOST SOMEONE IN ORDER TO

464
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
NAVIGATE I GUESS OVER THE NEXT

465
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
DAYS AND WEEKS AS THEY GRAPPLE

466
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
WITH THE AFTERMATH OF THIS

467
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

468
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
BUT THERE ARE MANY MORE

469
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
QUESTIONS PEOPLE HAVE.

470
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
FOR EXAMPLE, THE SHOOTER, 20

471
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
YEARS OLD, ADAM LANZA.

472
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
HIS MOTHER WAS ALSO KILLED AT A

473
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
LOCATION NOT FAR FROM HERE.

474
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
BUT BEYOND THAT, WE ACTUALLY

475
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT HIM.

476
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
WE'VE HAD SOME DESCRIPTIONS FROM

477
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
FRIENDS AND SCHOOLMATES, BUT IT

478
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
IS UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHAT COULD

479
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
POSSIBLY MOTIVATE HIM TO PULL

480
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
OFF SUCH A HEINOUS AND JUST

481
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
HORRIFYING CRIME.

482
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
WE WANT TO CHECK IN WITH MARY

483
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
SNOW, OUTSIDE THE SHOOTER'S HOME

484
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
THIS MORNING.

485
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
MARY, BEFORE I GO TO YOU, I WANT

486
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
TO WARN YOU, THERE'S A LOT OF

487
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
ACTION WHERE I AM.

488
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I MIGHT BREAK AWAY FROM YOU IF

489
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
THE PRESS CONFERENCE STARTS.

490
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
WHAT UPDATES CAN YOU GIVE US

491
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
THIS MORNING, MARY?

492
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
>> Reporter: WELL, SOLEDAD,

493
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
UNLIKE YESTERDAY WHERE IT WAS A

494
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
VERY ACTIVE SCENE HERE, IT IS

495
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
MUCH QUIETER TODAY.

496
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
WE ARE OUTSIDE THE LANZA HOME.

497
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
YOU CAN'T SEE IT BEHIND ME

498
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
BECAUSE THE ROAD IS BLOCKED OFF,

499
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
IT'S A LITTLE --

500
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
>> Reporter: I'M GOING TO

501
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
INTERRUPT YOU THERE.
AND LET'S IN FACT HEAD OVER TO

502
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE.

503
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
LOOKS LIKE LIEUTENANT VANCE IS

504
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
BEGINNING TO SPEAK.

505
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
LET'S LISTEN IN.

506
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
>> THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE

507
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

508
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
WITH ME IS THE CHIEF OF POLICE

509
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
IN NEWTOWN, THE FIELD OPERATIONS

510
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
COMMANDER OF THE STATE POLICE,

511
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
AND MY COUNTERPART HERE FROM

512
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
NEWTOWN POLICE DEPARTMENT.

513
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
AS YOU KNOW, THE VICTIMS HAVE

514
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
BEEN POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED BY

515
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF STATE'S

516
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER.
THEY'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF

517
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
DOING SOME OF THEIR WORK, AND AS

518
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
SOON AS THAT WORK IS COMPLETED,

519
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
WE WILL BE PREPARED TO RELEASE

520
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
IN WRITING TO YOU A FORMAL LIST

521
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
OF NAMES, BIRTHDATES, AND

522
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
INFORMATION.

523
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
THERE IS ONE -- THERE'S A COUPLE

524
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
MAJOR FACTORS.

525
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
NUMBER ONE, WHEN WE RELEASE THAT

526
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
LIST, AND WE WOULD ASK YOU AGAIN

527
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
AS WE DID YESTERDAY AT THE

528
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
REQUEST OF ALL OF THE FAMILY

529
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
MEMBERS, THEY HAVE ASKED FOR YOU

530
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
TO PLEASE RESPECT THEIR PRIVACY.

531
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
THEY'RE GOING THROUGH, AS I KNOW

532
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
YOU UNDERSTAND, A VERY DIFFICULT

533
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
AND TRYING TIME.

534
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
WE HAVE, IN FACT, THE JUSTICE OF

535
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
THE CHIEF AND THE COLONEL

536
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
REASSIGNED AND CONTINUE TO

537
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
ASSIGN A TROOPER TO THESE FOLKS

538
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
TO HELP TO MAINTAIN THAT

539
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
SOLITUDE.

540
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
SO AGAIN, I WOULD ASK YOU, I'M

541
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
PLEADING WITH YOU, AS YOU KNOW

542
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
THIS IS EXTREMELY HEARTBREAKING,

543
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
DIFFICULT THING FOR THESE FOLKS

544
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
TO ENDURE.

545
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
PLOOEZ PLEASE

546
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
PLEASE ABIDE BY THEIR REQUEST.

547
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
IN ADDITION TO THE TOWNSPEOPLE

548
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
IN THE TOWN OF NEWTOWN, A CRISIS

549
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
INTERVENTION TEAM FROM YALE NEW

550
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
HAVEN HOSPITAL HAS BEEN

551
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
ESTABLISHED IN THE COMMUNITY.

552
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
THEY CAN BE REACHED VIA

553
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
TELEPHONE.
THAT TELEPHONE NUMBER IS

554
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
203-270-4283.

555
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
AND AGAIN, THEY'RE OPEN, AND

556
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
THEY'RE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE IN

557
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
THE COMMUNITY WHO MAY HAVE THE

558
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
NEED TO DISCUSS, TO TALK, TO

559
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
TALK ABOUT THIS INCIDENT IN ITS

560
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
ENTIRETY.

561
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE SOME

562
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
QUESTIONS.
I JUST SIMPLY WANT YOU TO

563
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
UNDERSTAND THAT WE STILL HAVE

564
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
MAJOR CRIME DETECTIVES AND

565
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
NEWTOWN DETECTIVES WORKING AT

566
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
THE SCENE IN THE SCHOOL.

567
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
THAT IS NOT COMPLETED, THAT

568
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
PROBABLY WILL NOT BE COMPLETED

569
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER DAY AND A

570
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
HALF TO TWO DAYS.

571
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'M PUTTING A TIME LIMIT ON IT.

572
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
IT COULD TAKE LONGER.

573
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
AS I'VE EXPLAINED, WE HAVE DONE

574
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
EVERYTHING WE NEED TO DO TO

575
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
LITERALLY PEEL BACK THE ONION

576
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
LAYER BY LAYER AND EXAMINE EVERY

577
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
CRACK AND CREVICE OF THAT

578
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
FACILITY.
AND THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE OR

579
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
EXCLUDE I SHOULD SAY THE OUTSIDE

580
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
OF THE BUILDING.

581
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING IS

582
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
ALSO PART OF THE CRIME SCENE.

583
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
EVERY SINGLE VEHICLE IN THAT

584
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
LOT.
SO IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG,

585
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
PAINSTAKING PROCESS.

586
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
WE ACTUALLY HAVE THREE TEAMS

587
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
NOW, THREE MAJOR CRIME TEAMS IN

588
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
THE COMMUNITY.

589
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
OUR LOCAL PARTNERS WITH WORKING

590
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
WITH US.

591
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
WE'LL MOVE THAT AND EXPEDITE
THAT ALONG AS QUICKLY AS

592
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
POSSIBLE.

593
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
WE HAD A MEETING THIS MORNING,

594
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
AND THAT WAS A DELAY WITH THE

595
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS.

596
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
SHE WILL BE HOPEFULLY IN THE

597
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE UP HERE

598
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT SOME OF

599
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
THE ISSUES THAT SHE HAS

600
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
ENCOUNTERED.
THE MINUTE THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

601
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
IS DONE, AND I MEAN THAT

602
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
INSERIAL, THE MINUTE HE IS DONE

603
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
HE IS COMING HERE, AND WE WILL

604
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
AGAIN PROVIDE ALL THE DETAILED

605
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
INFORMATION OR AS MUCH DETAILED

606
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
INFORMATION AS WE CAN RELATIVE

607
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
TO THE WORK THAT HIS OFFICE DID

608
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
BOTH OVERNIGHT AND CONTINUE TO

609
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
DO AS WE SPEAK.

610
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
AGAIN, AS FAR AS ACTUAL SPECIFIC

611
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
QUESTIONS, I'LL TAKE A FEW.

612
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THERE

613
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE

614
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
SIMPLY CARDS THAT WE'RE HOLDING

615
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
CLOSE TO OUR CHEST IN THIS

616
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
INVESTIGATION UNTIL -- NO

617
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
NOTHING'S TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT

618
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
AND WE HAVE CONTINUITY OF ALL

619
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
THE INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDE.

620
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
YES, SIR?

621
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
>> THERE WERE REPORT THAT THERE

622
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
WERE OTHER GUNS OTHER THAN THE

623
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
ONES FOUND IN THE SCHOOL.

624
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
ARE THOSE REPORTS ACCURATE?

625
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
>> NO.
THAT'S NOT ACCURATE.

626
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
THE WEAPONRY THAT WAS RECOVERED

627
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
BY OUR INVESTIGATORS RECOVERED

628
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
IN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE

629
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
DECEASED.
AND AGAIN, WE'RE INVESTIGATING

630
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
THE HISTORY OF EACH AND EVERY

631
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
WEAPON.

632
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
AND WE WILL KNOW EVERY SINGLE

633
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
THING ABOUT THOSE WEAPONS, I

634
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
KNOW FOLLOWUP QUESTIONS ARE

635
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
LEGALLY REGISTERED, WHO ARE THE

636
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
OWNERS, SO ON, THAT'S BEING DONE

637
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
BY THE INVESTIGATORS ASSIGNED TO

638
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
THE TASK.

639
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
WE'RE, AGAIN, WE'RE GOING TO

640
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
ALLOW THE MEDICAL EXAMINER, WAIT

641
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
FOR THE MEDICAL EXAMINER TO COME

642
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
IN AND PROVIDE THE IDENTITIES OF

643
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
THE SHOOTER, OF ALL THE DECEASED

644
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

645
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
>> HAVE YOU FOUND ANY WRITINGS,

646
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
EMAILS, ANY MESSAGES THAT YOU

647
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
MIGHT VIEW AS TO WHAT IS GOING

648
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
--

649
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
>> THAT'S A FAIR, GOOD QUESTION.

650
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
THE ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU ON

651
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
THAT IS THAT OUR INVESTIGATORS

652
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
AT THE CRIME SCENE, THE SCHOOL

653
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
AND SECONDARILY AT THE SECONDARY

654
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
CRIME SCENE THAT WE DISCUSSED

655
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
WHERE THE FEMALE WAS LOCATED

656
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
DECEASED DID PRODUCE SOME VERY

657
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
-- VERY GOOD EVIDENCE IN THIS

658
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
INVESTIGATION, THAT OUR

659
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
INVESTIGATORS WILL BE ABLE TO

660
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
USE IN HOPEFULLY PAINTING THE

661
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
COMPLETE PICTURE AS TO HOW AND

662
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
MORE IMPORTANTLY WHY THIS

663
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
OCCURRED.
>> CAN YOU CHARACTERIZE THIS

664
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
TYPE OF EVIDENCE --

665
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO NAME THE

666
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
EVIDENCE.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT

667
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
THE EVIDENCE.

668
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
SIMPLY STATED, IT'S PART AND

669
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
PARCEL TO THE INVESTIGATION.

670
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT OUT OF

671
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
THE CONTEXT OF WHAT'S BEING

672
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
DONE.
>> CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT

673
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
SHATTERED GLASS --

674
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
>> WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE POINT

675
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
OF ENTRY.

676
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I CAN TELL YOU IT'S BELIEVED HE

677
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
WAS NOT VOLUNTARILY LET INTO THE

678
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
SCHOOL AT ALL.
THAT HE FORCED HIS WAY INTO THE

679
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
SCHOOL.

680
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
THAT'S AS FAR AS WE CAN GO ON

681
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
THAT.

682
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
>> ARE THERE BROKEN WINDOWS AT

683
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
THE SCHOOL?

684
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
>> WHAT?
>> BROKEN WINDOWS?

685
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
>> YEAH.

686
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
FRANKLY, THAT'S SOMETHING,

687
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
AGAIN, IF YOU TAKE IT OUT OF

688
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
CONTEXT, IT SOUNDS SUSPICIOUS.

689
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
BUT AS THE RESCUE CREWS ARRIVED,

690
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
THE ACTIVE SHOOTING TEAMS

691
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
ENTERED THE SCHOOL, THEY ENTERED

692
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
THE SCHOOL FROM SEVERAL

693
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
DIFFERENT POINTS.

694
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
AND IT NECESSITATED THEIR WAY IN

695
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
TO GAIN ACCESS TO PERFORM THE

696
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
RESCUE AND TO SAVE AS MANY

697
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
STUDENTS AND FACULTY AS THEY

698
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
COULD.

699
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
HENCE, LAW ENFORCEMENT BROKE

700
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
MANY WINDOWS.

701
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
>> THE OTHER CRIME SCENE --

702
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
>> YEAH, THE SECONDARY CRIME

703
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
SCENE AS I TOLD YOU WAS A CRIME

704
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
SCENE THAT WAS DISCOVERED

705
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
PURSUANT TO THE INVESTIGATION.

706
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
ONCE WE HAD THE TENTATIVE

707
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
IDENTIFICATION ON THE SUSPECT,

708
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
WE BEGAN DOING A GREAT DEAL OF

709
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
WORK, AGAIN, PEELING BACK THE

710
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
ONION.

711
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
EVERYTHING WE COULD FIND OUT

712
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
ABOUT THE SUSPECT INCLUDING AND

713
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
NOT LIMITED TO RELATIVES,

714
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
FRIENDS, CO-WORKERS, FORMER

715
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
STUDENTS, LOCATION OF RESIDENTS,

716
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
AND ALL THOSE AREAS HAD TO BE --

717
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
PEOPLE HAD TO BE INTERVIEWED AND

718
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
THE AREAS HAD TO BE EXAMINED.

719
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
HENCE, THAT CAUSED US TO

720
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
DISCOVER THE SECONDARY CRIME

721
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
SCENE WHICH WAS A PRIVATE

722
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
RESIDENCE WITH THE SOLE FEMALE

723
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
DECEASED.

724
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
>> WAS THERE PROVIDED A MOTIVE

725
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
OR EXPLANATION AS TO WHY --

726
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
>> TO BE DETERMINED.

727
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
THE DETECTIVES WILL ANALYZE

728
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
EVERYTHING AND PUT A COMPLETE

729
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
PICTURE TOGETHER OF THE EVIDENCE

730
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
THAT THEY DID OBTAIN.
WE'RE HOPEFUL, WE'RE HOPEFUL

731
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
THAT TELL PAINT A COMPLETE

732
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
PICTURE AS TO HOW AND WHY THIS

733
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
ENTIRE INCIDENT, UNFORTUNATE

734
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
INCIDENT OCCURRED.

735
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
>> AT THE CRIME SCENE, DID YOU

736
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
FIND A MAN OR WOMAN?

737
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
WILL.
>> I'M SORRY?

738
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
>> THERE WAS ONE WOMAN WHO WAS

739
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
SHOT AND SURVIVED.
HOW IS SHE?

740
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
>> SHE IS DOING FINE.

741
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
SHE'S -- SHE HAS BEEN TREATED,

742
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
AND SHE'LL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN

743
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
THIS INVESTIGATION, AS I'M SURE

744
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND.

745
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
[ INAUDIBLE ]
>> THAT I DON'T KNOW.

746
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
>> THE SHOOTER IN THIS CASE

747
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
APPEARED TO BREAK INTO THE

748
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000

750
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
THAT WOULD BE ACCURATE,

751
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
ACCORDING TO INVESTIGATORS.

752
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
YES.
>> AND DOES IT APPEAR HE USED TO

753
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
WEAPONS TO BREAK HIS WAY --

754
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
>> I DON'T WANT TO BE TOO

755
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
SPECIFIC BECAUSE FRANKLY I DON'T

756
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000

SO I WOULD SIMPLY -- I'VE BEEN

757
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
INFORMED THAT IT WAS FORCIBLY

758
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000

772
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000

NOT A LOT TO UPDATE FOLKS ON.

831
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
THEY HAD SENT OUT A WRITTEN

832
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000

ALSO A LIEUTENANT WITH THE

HE SAID AS SOON AS THE LIST OF

DECEASED IS, IN FACT, COMPLETED

841
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
THAT HE WOULD MAKE THAT PUBLIC.

842
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER WOULD BE

843
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
CHARGED WITH THAT.

844
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
THAT ALL THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO

LIKE EVERYONE TO RESPECT THEIR

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
PRIVACY.

849
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
AND TO THAT END, HE HAS ASSIGNED

850
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
A TROOPER TO EACH OF THE

851
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
FAMILIES.

852
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
AND HE CALLED THAT TO HELP

853
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
MAINTAIN THE SOLITUDE.

854
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
MEANING THAT THERE WILL BE A

855
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
BARRIER TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM

856
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
GETTING TO THOSE FAMILIES, TO

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
GIVE THEM SOME TIME AND GIVE

860
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
HAVE LOST IS JUST UNIMAGINABLE

868
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
AT THIS POINT.

869
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
HE SAID THAT A CRISIS

WANTED SOME SGIENS, W SGIE-- SO

GUIDANCE IN THE COMMUNITY.

876
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
DETECTIVES ARE ON THE SCENE OF

877
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
THE SCHOOL.
HE SAID IT COULD TAKE A DAY, IT

878
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
COULD TAKE AS LONG AS TWO DAYS.

879
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
THEY'RE GOING TO PEEL BACK THE

880
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
ONION, HIS QUOTE, TO TRY TO

881
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
INVESTIGATE EVERY CRACK AND

882
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
CREVICE AND REALLY FIGURE OUT

883
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
WHAT HAPPENED AND THE ORDER IN

884
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
WHICH THINGS HAD HAPPENED IN

885
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
THAT TEN-MINUTE WINDOW WHEN THE

886
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
SHOOTINGS HAPPENED.

887
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING, HE SAID

888
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
IT WAS ALSO PART OF THAT CRIME

889
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
SCENE.
THERE ARE THREE CRIME TEAMS, HE

890
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
SAID.
AND HE -- ESSENTIALLY ENDED BY

891
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
SAYING INVESTIGATORS WOULD

892
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
EVENTUALLY HAVE A VERY FULL

893
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
PICTURE OF HOW AND WHY THIS

894
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
OCCURRED.
THE HOW AND WHY WHICH, OF

895
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
COURSE, I THINK ARE THE

896
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
QUESTIONS THAT EVERYBODY'S

897
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
REALLY BEEN TRYING TO

898
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
UNDERSTAND.
HE SAID THEY WANT TO TALK TO

899
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
RELATIVES AND FRIENDS AND
CO-WORKERS AND FORMER CLASSMATES

900
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
OF THE SHOOTER'S.
THAT THE WOMAN WHO WAS, WE KNOW

901
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
WAS INJURED AND WHO HAD BEEN AT

902
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
ONE POINT IN THE ROOM WITH THE

903
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST AND THE

904
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
PRINCIPAL, THEY WERE HAVING A

905
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
MEETING ABOUT A STUDENT THAT

906
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
MORNING.

907
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
SHE ENDED UP BEING SHOT IN THE

908
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
FOOT I BELIEVE AND ALSO THE ARM.

909
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
BUT THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE

910
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
INSTRUMENTAL IN PIECING TOGETHER

911
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THIS

912
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
INVESTIGATION.

913
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
AND WITH THAT, HE ENDED WHAT WAS

914
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
A SHORT PRESS CONFERENCE.

915
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
HE SAID THE SUPERINTENDENT AND

916
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
TOWN LEADERS ARE GOING WANT TO

917
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
TALK TO FOLKS.

918
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
AND ALSO THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

919
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
WOULD BE SOMEONE THAT WE WOULD

920
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
BE HEARING FROM AS SOON AS THEY

921
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
FINISHED THE IDENTIFICATION

922
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
PROCESS.
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO UPDATE US

923
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
ON SOME MORE INFORMATION.

924
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
SO THAT'S WHERE IT STANDS RIGHT

925
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
NOW IN TERMS OF THE

926
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
INVESTIGATION.

927
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
BUT I'D GO BACK TO THE HOW AND

928
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
THE WHY.
I THINK SANJAY GUPTA IS JOINING

929
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
ME NOW.
THAT IS ALWAYS THE QUESTION FOR

930
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
THOSE OF US WHO COVER THESE

931
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
THINGS AND THOSE OF US WHO WATCH

932
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
IT ON TV AND PEOPLE IN TOWN,

933
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
TOO, CERTAINLY, PEOPLE WHO LOST

934
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
PEOPLE.

935
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
THE WHY BEHIND IT.

936
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
THERE HAS BEEN -- IS THERE A

937
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
CONNECTIONTIVE THREAD WHEN IT

938
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
COMES TO THESE MASS SHOOTINGS?

939
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
ARE THERE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN

940
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
MASS SHOOTINGS THAT DEAL WITH

941
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
MENTAL STABILITY?
>> OFTENTIMES THERE ARE.

942
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
BUT OFTEN TIMES I KEEP HEARING,

943
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
AND I'VE TALKED TO PEOPLE AS YOU

944
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
HAVE OVER THE YEARS, A LOT OF

945
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
TIMES THE ANSWER IS UNKNOWABLE.

946
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
IT'S NOT SATISFYING, PEOPLE WANT

947
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO THESE

948
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
QUESTIONS.

949
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
BUT SOMETIMES WE JUST NEVER CAN

950
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
KNOW FOR SURE.

951
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
EVEN AFTER THE INVESTIGATION IS

952
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
DONE, THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

953
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
CLOSEST TO THE PERSON INVOLVED

954
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
HERE, YOU STILL DON'T HAVE A

955
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
VERY SATISFYING ANSWER.

956
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
AND I JUST SAY THAT BECAUSE I

957
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE

958
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
MAY NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR.

959
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS, IT

960
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
MAY NOT COME BACK A DEFINITIVE

961
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
REASON.

962
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
ALL SORTS OF SPECULATION AS YOU

963
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
KNOW TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING

964
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
ABOUT THIS.

965
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE KNOW ANY OF

966
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
THAT FOR SURE, AND WE MAY NEVER.

967
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
>> Reporter: WE KNOW THAT A
FAMILY MEMBER TOLD INVESTIGATORS

968
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
THAT THE SHOOTER HAD SOME TYPE

969
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
OF AUTISM.
I THINK A PHRASE THEY USED.

970
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
AND AS I'VE TOLD YOU A BUNCH OF

971
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
TIMES, MY NEPHEW'S AUTISTIC.

972
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I KNOW A LITTLE ABOUT AUTISM.

973
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY CONNECTION

974
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
BETWEEN AUTISM AND VIOLENT

975
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
BEHAVIOR.
IS THERE A CONNECTION BETWEEN

976
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
AUTISM AND ANY VIOLENT BEHAVIOR?

977
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
IS THERE A CONNECTION BETWEEN

978
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
VIOLENT BEHAVIOR AND ANY OTHER

979
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
MENTAL ILLNESS -- I SHOULD SAY

980
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
OF MENTAL ILLNESS SINCE AUTISM

981
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
IS NOT A MENTAL ILLNESS.

982
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
>> RIGHT.
AUTISM IS NOT A MENTAL ILLNESS,

983
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
IT'S NOT A PERSONALITY DISORDER

984
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED.

985
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST

986
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
THAT THERE'S A LINK BETWEEN

987
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
AUTISM OR ANYTHING ON THE AUTISM

988
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
SPECTRUM AND PLANNED VIOLENCE.

989
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
THERE CAN BE REACTIVE VIOLENCE,

990
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
CALL THEM VIOLENT OUTBUSTS.

991
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
THAT THEIR CAN BE LIMITED --

992
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
SINCE WE SPOKE I LOOKED UP SOME
MORE RESEARCH ON THAT.

993
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
THERE WAS ONE STUDY THAT SAID

994
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
OUT OF 132 PEOPLE WHO HAD

995
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
AUTISM, THERE WERE THREE

996
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
DEMOCRAT THAT DEMONSTRATED

997
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
EVIDENCE OF VIOLENCE.
AGAIN, THAT WAS REACTIVE

998
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
VIOLENCE, NOT PLANNED VIOLENCE

999
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
AS SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED HERE.

1000
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
>> Reporter: SO WHAT -- WHAT

1001
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
WILL THE RECOVERY PROCESS BE FOR

1002
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
PEOPLE?
I MEAN, EVERY PARENT I TALKED TO

1003
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
AND NOW IN THE, YOU KNOW, 18

1004
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
HOURS WE'VE BEEN HERE ON THE

1005
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
SCENE, THEY'RE TRAUMATIZED.

1006
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
THE PARENTS ARE TRAUMATIZED.

1007
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
SOME HAD BROUGHT THEIR KIDS WITH

1008
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
THEM, AND THE CHILDREN ARE

1009
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
CLEARLY TRAUMATIZED.

1010
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
AND THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT

1011
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
TO DO.
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK IF THERE'S

1012
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
ANY GOOD NEWS IN THIS, THAT IS

1013
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
LOOKING THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND

1014
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
EVERYTHING IS OBVIOUSLY

1015
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
UNPRECEDENTED HERE, BUT

1016
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
TYPICALLY IT IS A MOURNING

1017
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
PROCESS THAT WILL LAST.

1018
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
BUT IT IS SHORT-LIVED AND MAYBE

1019
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
EVEN MORE SHORT-LIVED FOR THE

1020
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
CHILDREN AS COMPARED TO THEIR

1021
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
PARENTS.

1022
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
CHILDREN TEND TO BE MORE

1023
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
RESILIENT HERE.

1024
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I THINK OBVIOUSLY TALKING ABOUT

1025
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
THIS, BUT ALSO RESTORING SOME

1026
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
SORT OF NORMALCY TO THEIR LIVES.

1027
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
AND YOU KNOW, WE SAY THAT ALL

1028
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
THE TIME, BUT IT MAKES A HUGE

1029
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
DIFFERENCE TO ACTUALLY GO BACK

1030
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
TO SOME SORT OF NORMAL PATTERN.

1031
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
IF YOU HAD SOCCER PRACTICE ON

1032
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
SATURDAY, TO DO THAT PRACTICE.

1033
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
PIANO LESSONS TOMORROW, THE SAME

1034
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
THING.

1035
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
>> Reporter: HOW POSSIBLY DO YOU

1036
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
REOPEN A SCHOOL WHERE CHILDREN

1037
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
WERE HIDING INSIDE THEIR CUBBIES

1038
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
HOPING NOT TO GET SHOT?

1039
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I KNOW THAT EVENTUALLY COLUMBINE

1040
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
WAS REOPENED, RIGHT?

1041
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
THERE WAS A SIMILAR HORRIFIC

1042
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
EXPERIENCE.

1043
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
AND PEOPLE DID EVENTUALLY GO

1044
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
BACK.
BUT I JUST CAN'T WRAP MY MIND

1045
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
AROUND THAT.

1046
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF IT NEEDS TO

1047
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
BE COMMEMORATED IN ONE WAY AND

1048
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
ACKNOWLEDGED.
I THINK A COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY

1049
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
SEEMS TO BE KEY HERE, NOT TRYING

1050
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
TO HIDE THESE THINGS.

1051
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW

1052
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
THAT IN FACT THIS DID HAPPEN

1053
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
HERE, BUT THAT -- PEOPLE ARE

1054
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
GOING TO MOVE BEYOND THAT.

1055
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
AND ALSO THIS WHOLE NOTION OF

THESE COUPLE OF DAYS BEING SO

1057
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
IMPORTANT.

1058
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
YOU KNOW, NOT PUTTING IT OFF,

1059
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
MAKING SURE THAT IF IT'S GOING

1060
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
TO BE DISCUSSED IT'S DISCUSSED

1061
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
BECAUSE A LONGER -- THE LONGER

1062
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
SYMPTOMS SORT OF LAST IN

1063
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
CHILDREN AND ADULTS, THE HARDER

1064
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
IT IS TO TREAT.

1065

1066
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
HAVEN HOSPITAL HAS VOLUNTEERED A

1067

COUNSELING LINE.

1068
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I WAS SURPRISED AND WONDERED IS

1069
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
IT EFFECTIVE TO DO COUNSELING ON

1070
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
PHONE, AS EFFECTIVE AS SEEING

1071
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
SOMEONE IN PERSON?

1072
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
>> I THINK IT VERY MUCH CAN BE.

1073
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
THIS IS A NATIONALLY KNOWN

1074
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
CENTER.
I'VE DEALT WITH THEM IN THE

1075
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
PAST.

1076
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
THEY HAPPEN TO BE CLOSE BY.

1077
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
THEY DEAL WITH THESE TYPES OF

1078
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
ISSUES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

1079
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
THEY SERVE AS A REMINDER THAT

1080
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE GOING

1081
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
THROUGH THIS.
WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS,

1082
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
YOU TEND TO THINK THAT IT'S YOU,

1083
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE

1084
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
THAT HAS LED YOU TO FEELING THIS

1085
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
WAY.

1089
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
GOING THROUGH THIS.

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
VERY MUCH.
I APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT ON

1092
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
THAT.
WE KNOW LOTS ABOUT THE SCENE SO

1093
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
FAR.
BUT VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE

1094
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
VICTIMS.
VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE SHOOTER.

1095
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE CRIME

1096
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
SCENE.
WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE DETAILS

1097
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
ABOUT HOW THIS TERRIBLE TRAGEDY

1098
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
UNFOLDED, THAT'S STRAIGHT AHEAD
AFTER THIS BREAK.

1099
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
STAY WITH US.

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
[ Male Announcer ]
THIS IS SHELDON, WHOSE LONG DY
SETTING UP THE NEWS

1101
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
STARTS WITH ARTHRITIS PAIN

PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND

1171
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
THE WHY AND MAYBE IT'S NOT

1172
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE

1173
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000

1193
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
KEEP KIDS SAFE DURING THE

1194
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
SHOOTING.

1195
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
LISTEN.
>> EVERYBODY DOES WHAT THEY HAVE

1196
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
TO DO WHEN THEY'RE CONFRONTED

1197
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
WITH A SITUATION LIKE THAT.

1198
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
AND EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW, WE

1199
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000

1200
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
AND THEY KNEW WHAT TO DO.

1201
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
AND YOU JUST -- YOU THINK ABOUT

1202
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
PROTECTING THE KIDS AND JUST

>> WE HAVE LOCKDOWN DRILLS.

1206
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY, BUT

1207
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
THERE'S RULES.

1208
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN

1209
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
NUMBER OF FIRE DRILLS,

1210
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
EVACUATION DRILLS, AND LOCKDOWN

1211
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
DRILLS.
THE KIDS KNOW THE ROUTINE AND

1212
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
TEACHERS KNOW THE ROUTINE.

1213
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
EVERYONE HAS A SPOT THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO GO TO.

1214
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
>> CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE SPOT?

1215
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
>> IN THE LIBRARY IT'S BETWEEN

1216
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
SOME BOOK CASES AGAINST A WALL

1217
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
WHERE YOU CAN'T BE SEEN FROM ANY

1218
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
WINDOWS.
WE HAD TO MOVE OUT OF THAT SPOT

1219
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
BECAUSE ONE OF OUR DOORS WASN'T

1220
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
LOCKED WE DISCOVERED SO WE WENT

1221
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
TO A BACK STORAGE ROOM AND

1222
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
LOCKED THE KIDS IN THERE.

1223
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
>> HOW DID YOU GET --

1224
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
>> WE WERE THIS CLOSE TOGETHER.

1225
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
>> HOW DID YOU GET THE CHILDREN

1226
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
TO BE QUIET?

1227
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
>> THERE WAS CRAYONS AND PAPER

1228
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
IN THE STORAGE ROOM IN THE BACK.

1229
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
WE TORE SOME UP AND GAVE THEM

1230
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
CLIPBOARDS AND HAD THEIR COLOR

1231
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
AND DRAW.

1232
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
>> WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM --

1233
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
>> WERE ALONE?

1234
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
>> THERE WERE THREE OTHER

1235
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
ADULTS.

1236
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
THEY WERE ASKING WHAT WAS GOING

1237
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
ON, WE SAID WE DON'T KNOW, OUR

1238
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
JOB IS TO STAY QUIET.

1239
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
IT MAY BE A DRILL, IT MAY NOT.

1240
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
>> YOU DIDN'T KNOW AT THAT

1241
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
POINT?
>> WE KNEW BECAUSE I CALLED THE

1242
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
OFFICE, AND SHE TOLD ME THERE

1243
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
WAS A SHOOTER.
MY KIDS, FRIEND OF THEIRS, HAVE

1244
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
LITTLE BROTHERS OR SISTERS THAT

1245
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
ARE DEAD.

1246
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
EVERYBODY IN TOWN KNOWS

1247
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
EVERYBODY.

1248
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I'M JUST GLAD THEY WERE SAFE.

1249
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
WE WERE IN LOCKDOWN AND THEY
DIDN'T KNOW.

1250
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
THE KIDS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL WERE

1251
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
IN LOCKDOWN WATCHING.

1252
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
THEY HAVE FAMILY.

1253
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
THIS WAS PROBABLY DIFFICULT.

1254
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
>> CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT --

1255
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
>> CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT TO ME?

1256
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
>> DID YOU KNOW THE MOTHER?

1257
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
>> NO.
SHE WASN'T IN PLAY.

1258
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL?

1259
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
EVERYONE'S SAYING WHAT A GREAT

1260
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
PERSON SHE WAS, HOW MUCH DO YOU

1261
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
--

1262
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
>> SHE WAS A PERSONAL FRIEND AND

1263
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
A WONDERFUL LEADER.

1264
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
>> LAST NIGHT A TEACHER TOLD OUR

1265
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
ANDERSON COOPER THAT SHE TOOK

1266
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
THE KIDS IN HER CLASS INTO

1267
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
ANOTHER ROOM AND JUST HAD THEM

1268
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
READ, READ TOGETHER.

1269
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
AND JUST TO HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL

1270
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT, TO HAVE

1271
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
THE COMPOSURE TO WHILE THIS IS

1272
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
HAPPENING KEEP THE CHILDREN CALM

1273
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
AND MORE THAN ONE PARENT SAID,

1274
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
SOLEDAD, THAT THE TEACHERS SAVED

1275
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES.

1276
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
THE ONES WHO WERE ABLE TO TAKE

1277
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
THEIR CHILDREN HOME.

1278
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR MORE ABOUT

1279
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
THE HEROISM AS WE LEARN ABOUT

1280
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
THE TRAGEDY AS THE DAYS GO ON.

1281
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
SOLEDAD?
>> MY GOODNESS, VICTOR.

1282
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
THESE TEACHERS ARE TRUE HEROES.

1283
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT THEY DID TO

1284
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
TRY TO -- NOT JUST KEEP THEM

1285
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
SAFE BUT KEEP THEM QUIET.

1286
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
THEY WERE WORRIED IF THE GUNMAN

1287
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
HEARD THE CHILDREN TALKING OR

1288
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
ANYBODY MADE NOISE OR CRYING

1289
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
THAT HE COULD TARGET THEIR

1290
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
CLASSROOM.

1291
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
SO TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT, KEEP

1292
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
THEM CALM, DISTRACT THEM BECAUSE

1293
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
THEY'RE SMALL CHILDREN AND THEY

1294
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO ALMOST BE

1295
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
FOCUSED ON SOMETHING ELSE, WHAT

1296
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
THEY HAD DONE IS NOTHING SHORT

1297
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
OF HEROIC.

1298
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
IT'S AN AMAZING THING.

1299
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
VICTOR BLACKWELL REPORTING,

1300
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT.

1301
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A BREAK.

1302
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
WE'LL CONTINUE TO UPDATE YOU ON

1304
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
THIS SHOOTING HERE AT A

1306
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
CONNECTICUT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1307
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
WE'RE BACK IN A MOMENT.
STAY WITH US.

1308
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
THERE'S A HEALTH COMPANY THAT
CAN HELP YOU STAY THAT WAY.

1309
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
WHAT'S HEALTHIER THAN THAT?

1310
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
CUSTOMER ERIN SWENSON
BOUGHT SO, I'M HAPPY. TODAY.

1311
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
SALES GO UP... I'M HAPPY.

1312
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
IT WENT OUT TODAY... I'M HAPPY.

1313
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
WHAT IF SHE'S NOT HOME?

1314
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
(TOGETHER)
SHE WON'T BE HAPPY.

1315
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
USE UPS! SHE CAN GET
A TEXT ALERT, REROUTE...

1316
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
EVEN RESCHEDULE HER PACKAGE.

1317
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
IT'S UPS MY CHOICE.

1318
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
ARE YOU HAPPY?

1319
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I'M HAPPY.

1320
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'M HAPPY.
I'M HAPPY.

1321
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I'M HAPPY.
I'M HAPPY.

1322
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
HAPPY.

1323
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
HAPPY.
HAPPY.
HAPPY.
(TOGETHER)
HAPPY.

1324
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I LOVE LOGISTICS.

1325
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
>>> WELCOME BACK.

1326
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
YOU'RE WATCHING OUR SPECIAL

1327
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
COVERAGE OF THE SCHOOL SHOOTING

1328
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1329
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
WE LEARNED FROM A CONFERENCE

1330
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
THAT THE SHOOTER, ADAM LANZA,

1331
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
GAINED ENTRY IN FACT INTO THE

1332
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
SCHOOL BY FORCING HIS WAY

1333
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
INSIDE.

1334
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
WE HAD HEARD REPORTS THAT THERE

1335
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
HAD BEEN A NEW SECURITY SYSTEM

1336
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
SET UP FOR WHEN THE NEW

1337
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
PRINCIPAL CAME IN.

1338
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
ONCE HE GOT INSIDE, HE WAS ABLE

1339
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
TO KILL 26 PEOPLE, ALL THE

1340
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
WEAPONS THAT HE USED WERE

1341
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
PURCHASED LEGALLY AND PURCHASED

1342
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
IN FACT BY HIS MOTHER.
WE WANT TO BRING IN THE FORMER

1343
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR TOM

1344
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
FUENTES.

1345
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
ALSO A CNN CRIB ONTRIBUTOR.

1346
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
WE HEARD IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE

1347
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
THAT THE CRIME SCENE IS STILL

1348
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
BEING PROCESSED.

1349
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
TELL ME ABOUT WHAT THEY WOULD BE

1350
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
DOING NOW.

1351
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
THE BODIES WE KNOW ARE MOVED TO

1352
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
A MORGUE.

1353
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

1354
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
>> THE SCENE AT THE INSIDE OF

1355
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
THE SCHOOL WOULD BE TO TRACE THE

1356
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
STEPS OF THE SHOOTER, WHERE DID

1357
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
HE GO EVERY STEP OF THE WAY FROM

1358
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
THE TIME HE GAINED ENTRY, WHICH

1359
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
ROOMS HE WAS IN, WHERE HE WAS

1360
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
WHEN HE FIRED THE SHOTS, WHERE

1361
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
THE VICTIMS WERE WHEN THEY GOT

1362
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
SHOT, AND TRY TO DETERMINE EVERY

1363
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
STEP HE TOOK WHILE IN THERE

1364
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
LEADING UP TO HIM TAKING HIS OWN

1365
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
LIFE.

1366
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
THAT PART IS VERY DIFFICULT.

1367
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO TRACE THE

1368
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
DIRECTION OF BULLET AND WHERE

1369
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
THEY MAY HAVE HIT WALLS AND PICK

1370
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
UP THE BULLET CASINGS THAT WOULD

1371
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
HAVE BEEN SPRAYED OUT OF THE GUN

1372
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
AS HE WAS SHOOTING OR THE TWO

1373
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
GUNS AS HE WAS SHOOTING.

1374
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
THAT'S A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS.

1375
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
TAKES A LOT OF METICULOUS WORK

1376
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
ON THE CRIME SCENE

1377
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
INVESTIGATORS.

1378
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
OF COURSE YOU HAVE THE CRIME

1379
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
SCENE OUTSIDE THE BUILDING, ANY

1380
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
MATERIAL HE MAY HAVE DROPPED.

1381
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
MAYBE HE WAS WALKING AROUND

1382
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
BEFOREHAND OR HIS VEHICLE.
THEN OF COURSE AT HIS RESIDENCE

1383
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
WHERE YOU HAVE PRESUMABLY HIS

1384
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
MOTHER KILLED BEFORE HE DEPARTS

1385
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
AND GOES TO THE SCHOOL AND

1386
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
SHOOTS EVERYBODY ELSE.

1387
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
SO THESE CRIME SCENES TAKE A LOT

1388
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
OF PHYSICAL WORK TO PROCESS.

1389
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
>> Reporter: THEY SAID THAT THEY

1390
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
WERE GOING TO TRY TO FIND THE

1391
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
HOW AND THE WHY.

1392
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
AND HOW OFTEN, IN FACT, I THINK

1393
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
THEY FIGURE OUT THE HOW.

1394
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
THEY'RE ABLE TO PIECE TOGETHER

1395
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
CLEARLY, EVENTUALLY, WHAT

1396
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
UNFOLDED.
BUT HOW OFTEN IN CASES LIKE THIS

1397
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
DO WE JUST NEVER REALLY KNOW THE

1398
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
WHY?

1399
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
AND BEFORE I LET YOU ANSWER, I

1400
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
WANT TO TELL WHOEVER'S TALKING

1401
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
IN MY EAR WHILE YOU'RE TALKING,

1402
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
IT'S HARD TO HEAR.

1403
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
IF YOU IN THE CONTROL ROOM WOULD

1404
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
FIX, THAT I'M GETTING ANOTHER

1405
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
FEED.

1406
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
SOMEONE ELSE IS TALKING IN MY

1407
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
EAR.
TOM, GO AHEAD, HOW LIKELY THAT

1408
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
WE'RE GOING TO GET THE WHY IN

1409
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
THIS CASE?

1410
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
THE PROBLEM IS EVEN IF EXPERTS

1411
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
SAY THEY KNOW WHY, DO THEY

1412
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
REALLY?

1413
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
AS MR. GUPTA SAID, MAYBE IT'S

1414
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
UNKNOWABLE.
EVEN IF THEY GET EMAILS, EVEN IF

1415
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
THEY GET CONVERSATIONS THAT HE'S

1416
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
HAD WITH OTHER FRIENDS OR FAMILY

1417
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
MEMBERS, NEIGHBORS, SOMEBODY

1418
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
SAYING THAT HE WAS GOING DO THIS

1419
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
OR WHY HE WAS GOING TO DO IT,

1420
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT IT WAS

1421
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
TRUTHFUL.

1422
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
FOUN HE MEA

1423
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
YOU DON'T KNOW IF HE MEANT IT,

1424
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
IF HE WAS DELUSIONAL.
THERE'S SO MANY ASPECTS THAT

1425
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
WE'RE NOT EVER GOING TO KNOW.

1426
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF

1427
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
SPECULATION BY EXPERTS, BUT

1428
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO REALLY KNOW

1429
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
POSITIVELY WHAT WAS ON HIS MIND

1430
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
WHEN HE WENT TO COMMIT THESE

1431
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
ACTS.
AND YOU KNOW, THE CLOSEST PERSON

1432
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
TO HIM TO MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE

1433
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
THEIR OWN MOTHER, SHE'S NOT

1434
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO TALK

1435
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
TO.
WHETHER HE WAS CLOSE WITH HIS

1436
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
BROTHER OR FATHER, WE DON'T

1437
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
KNOW.
YOU KNOW, WE ALSO DON'T KNOW WAS

1438
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
THIS A CLOSE KNIT FAMILY GROWING

1439
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
UP OR WERE THEY DYSFUNCTIONAL

1440
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
AND HE WAS OFF ON HIS OWN

1441
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
MENTALLY OR PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

1442
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
AND SO I DON'T PUT A LOT OF

1443
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
FAITH INTO THE SPECULATION.

1444
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
INVESTIGATORS WILL DO EVERYTHING

1445
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
THEY CAN TO PROFILE HIM AND SEE

1446
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
WHAT WAS ON HIS MIND BUT THEY'RE

1447
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
NEVER GOING TO KNOW POSITIVELY.

1448
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
>> Reporter: HOW WOULD YOU

1449
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
ASSESS THE JOB THAT THE LAW

1450
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
ENFORCEMENT HERE DID FROM

1451
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
LISTENING TO THOSE 911 CALLS AND

1452
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
ALSO I THINK IN THE CONTEXT OF

1453
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
KNOWING THAT THIS IS A COMMUNITY

1454
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
THAT HASN'T HAD A HOMICIDE IN A

1455
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
DECADE?
I DON'T THINK IT'S A PLACE WHERE

1456
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
THEY ARE USED TO SHOOGSZ,

1457
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
FRANKFRAN -- TO

1458
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
SHOOTINGS, FRANKLY.

1459
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
>> FORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK

1460
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
MANY COMMUNITIES ARE USED TO A

1461
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
MASS MURDER AT THEIR SCHOOLS.

1462
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
THE SITUATION THE FIRST

1463
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
RESPONDERS FACED WAS EXTREMELY

1464
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
DIFFICULT.
APPEARS THEY HANDLED IT

1465
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
PROFESSIONALLY AND DID A GOOD

1466
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
JOB.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY HAD

1467
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
MULTIPLE SHOOTERS.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW IF SOMEONE HAD

1468
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
LEFT AND WAS IN THE WOODS OR HAD

1469
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
RUN INTO A NEIGHBORING HOUSE AND

1470
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
WAS HOLDING A FAMILY HOSTAGE.

1471
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ALL THE

1472
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
CHILDREN WERE.

1473
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
WE HAD REPORTS THAT SOME

1474
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
CHILDREN WERE RUNNING THROUGH

1475
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
THE FIELD AND THROUGH PEOPLE'S

1476
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
BACK YARDS IN THE IMMEDIATE

1477
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
AFTERMATH.
SO FOR POLICE TO ARRIVE AND

1478
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
QUICKLY ASSESS WHAT IT OCCURRED

1479
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT, IT

1480
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
APPEARS THAT THEY DID A VERY

1481
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
PROFESSIONAL JOB.

1482
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
NOW IN THE AFTERMATH OF IT, YOU

1483
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
HAVE THE POLICE TRYING TO

1484
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
CONTROL THE INFORMATION.

1485
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
AND THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT

1486
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
TASK.
AND I THINK AN UNDERRATED TASK

1487
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
FOR POLICE EXECUTIVES.
IF THE POLICE GIVE OUT TOO MUCH

1488
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
INFORMATION TOO SOON, IT COULD

1489
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
BE INACCURATE, IT COULD OBSTRUCT

1490
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION.

1491
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
FRANKLY, IF THEY GIVE TOO LITTLE

1492
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
INFORMATION, ENTERPRISING

1493
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
REPORTERS NOT FROM CNN OF

1494
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
COURSE, BUT SOME ENTERPRISING

1495
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
REPORTERS WILL FILL THE VACUUM

1496
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
WITH INACCURATE DATA, AND THAT

1497
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
WILL ALSO CLOUD THE

1498
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
INVESTIGATION.
SO IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING

1499
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
TO ACTUALLY CONDUCT THE

1500
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
INVESTIGATION, AND IT'S ALSO A

1501
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
DIFFICULT THING TO DESCRIBE AND

1502
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
REPORT ON THE INVESTIGATION TO

1503
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
THE PUBLIC.

1504
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
>> IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR

1505
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
LIEUTENANT VANCE TALK ABOUT

1506
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
ASSIGNING TROOPERS TO EACH

1507
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
FAMILY THAT BASICALLY WANTED TO

1508
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
ENSURE THEIR PRIVACY BECAUSE, OF

1509
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
COURSE, THERE IS -- I'M GOING TO

1510
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
GUESS LIKE 100 LIVE CAMERAS ALL

1511
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
WIRED HERE IN THE PARKING LOT

1512
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
FROM THE SORT OF THE HALF MILE

1513
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
FROM THE SCHOOL WHERE WE ARE.

1514
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
HE'S GOING TO PROTECT THEM FROM

1515
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

1516
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
MEDIA.
IS THAT UNUSUAL?

1517
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
IT SEEMED TO BE A SMART THING.

1518
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
>> VERY SMART THING.

1519
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
LIEUTENANT VANCE HAS DONE AN

1520
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
EXCEPTIONAL JOB IN THE WAY THAT

1521
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
HE'S CONDUCTED PRESS CONFERENCES

1522
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
FROM THE BEGINNING UNTIL AND

1523
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
INCLUDING THIS MORNING.

1524
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
THE DIFFICULTY HERE AND THE
POLICE ARE WELL AWARE OF WHAT'S

1525
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
GOING TO HAPPEN, AS SOON AS THE

1526
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
NAMES OF THOSE VICTIMS ARE

1527
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
ACTUALLY RELEASED AND BECOME

1528
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
PUBLIC THOSE FAMILIES ARE GOING

1529
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
TO BE INUNDATED NO MATTER HOW

1530
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
MUCH HE AND OTHERS PLEAD FOR THE

1531
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
PRIVACY AND SOLITUDE OF THE

1532
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
VICTIMS' FAMILIES.

1533
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
FRANKLY, IT'S NOT GOING TO

1534
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
COMPLETELY HAPPEN.

1535
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
THERE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE,

1536
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
EVEN WELL WISHERS CONTACTING

1537
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
THEM THAT ARE THINKING THEY'RE

1538
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
BEING HELPFUL.

1539
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WILL BE
PEOPLE TRYING TO EXPLOIT THEM

1540
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

1541
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
SITUATION AND OF THE POOR

1542
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
VICTIMS.
THERE'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES.

1543
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
THE POLICE KNOW WHAT'S GOING

1544
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
HAPPEN IN TERMS OF THE PRIVACY

1545
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
OF THOSE FAMILY AS SOON AS THE

1546
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
NAMES GO OUT.

1547
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
THEY KNOW THE FAMILIES ARE IN

1548
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
FOR A LOT OF TROUBLE IN THE DAYS

1549
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
AHEAD.
>> Reporter: YEAH.

1550
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I HOPE THOSE TROOPERS KNOW

1551
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
THEY'LL BE WORKING HARD TO KEEP

1552
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
THE PRIVACY FOR THE FAMILY

1553
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
MEMBERS.

1554
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
TOM, THANK YOU.

1555
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
FORMERLY WITH THE FBI.
WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND

1556
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
INSIGHT THIS MORNING.
WE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT

1557
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
EARLIER CALLING FOR MEANINGFUL

1558
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
ACTION IN THE WAKE OF THIS

1559
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
TRAGEDY.
THERE'S ALSO THIS FROM THE NEW

1560
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
YORK MAYOR, MICHAEL BLOOMBERG,

1561
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
"CALLING FOR "MEANINGFUL ACTION"

1562
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
IS NOT NUFD.

1563
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
WE NEED IMMEDIATE ACTION.

1564
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
WE HAVE HEARD ALL THE RHETORIC

1565
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
BEFORE, WHAT WE'VE NOT SEEN IS

1566
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
LEADERSHIP, NOT FROM THE WHITE

1567
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
HOUSE AND NOT FROM CONGRESS.

1568
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
THAT MUST END TODAY."

1569
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
JOINING US IS CNN CONTRIBUTOR

1570
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
MARIA CAR DON'T AAMY HOLMES OF

1571
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
THE BLAZE.COM.

1572
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
THE YEAS ARE A, YOU'VE GOT KIDS

1573
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I IMAGINE -- MARIA, YOU'VE GOT

1574
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
KIDS I IMAGINE.

1575
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
AND AMY, YOU HAVE REPORTED -- I

1576
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
HAVE TO IMAGINE YOU'RE

1577
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
HORRIFIED.
>> I KNOW THERE WAS NOT A DRY

1578
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
EYE YESTERDAY, ESPECIALLY FROM

1579
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
PARENTS.
I SAW YOU THIS MORNING CHOKING

1580
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
UP.
AND EVERY SECOND I FEEL LIKE I'M

1581
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
ABOUT TO CHOKE UP.

1582
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
YES, THIS IS A NATIONAL TRAGEDY.

1583
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I AGREE FRANKLY WITH MAYOR

1584
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
BLOOMBERG.
OUR LEADERS NEED TO STEP UP

1585
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
INCLUDING PRESIDENT OBAMA.

1586
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I HOPE THAT HIS CALL FOR

1587
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
MEANINGFUL ACTION WILL MEAN

1588
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
IMMEDIATE ACTION.
THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE CAN

1589
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
DO IMMEDIATELY, THAT IS RENEW

1590
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
THE BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS.

1591
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
THERE'S NO REASON WHY THE

1592
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
SHOOTER HAD THAT SEMIAUTOMATIC

1593
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
RIFLE IN HIS POSSESSION.

1594
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
THERE ALSO SHOULD BE A WAY TO

1595
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
GET RID OF THE LOOPHOLE, THE GUN

1596
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
SHOW LOOPHOLE WHERE 40% OF GUNS

1597
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
ARE SOLD WITHOUT BACKGROUND

1598
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
CHECKS.

1599
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
THERE IS NO SANE, RATIONAL

1600
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
REASON IN THE WORLD WHY THAT

1601
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
SHOULD BE HAPPENING IN THIS

1602
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
COUNTRY TODAY.

1603
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
>> RIGHT.

1604
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT ASSAULT

1605
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
RIFLES, SEMIAUTOMATIC ASSAULT

1606
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
RIFLE, THE BUSHMASTER 223, THAT

1607
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
WAS IN THE CAR.

1608
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
HE PULLED OFF THIS ATTACK USING

1609
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
GUNS BUT NOT ASSAULT WEAPONS

1610
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
BANNED IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE.

1611
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE HAD AN

1612
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
IMPACT.
AMY HOLMES, I KNOW IT'S NOT JUST

1613
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
REPUBLICANS.
THERE ARE PLENTY OF DEMOCRATS,

1614
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
TOO, WHO GET ANTSY WHEN PEOPLE

1615
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
START TALKING ABOUT GUN CONTROL.

1616
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
AND PUTTING LIMITS ON THE

1617
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
ABILITY TO OWN GUNS.

1618
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
SO WHAT DOES MEANFUL ACTION IN

1619
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
YOUR MIND MEAN?

1620
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
>> WELL, I THINK AS LIEUTENANT

1621
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
VANCE SAID, WE NEED TO PEEL BACK

1622
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
THE ONION AND UNDERSTAND HOW HE

1623
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
DID GET POTISSESSION OF THE GUN.

1624
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
AS WE UNDERSTAND, THEY WERE

1625
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
REGISTERED TO HER MOTHER.

1626
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
WHY THEY WERE AVAILABLE IS HARD

1627
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
TO KNOW.
I THINK ONE THING WE CAN DO IN

1628
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
TERMS OF MEANINGFUL ACTION IS

1629
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
NOT TO GLORIFY THESE VILLAINS

1630
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
AND THESE KILLERS AND NOT TO USE

1631
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
THEIR NAMES, NOT TO REFERENCE

1632
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
THEM DIRECTLY.

1633
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

1634
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
BEEN LEARNING WITH THESE MASS

1635
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
SHOOTERS THEY THEY DO SORT OF

1636
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
REVEL IN THEIR NOTE RIGHT AND

1637
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
THEY DO SEEK NOTORIETY.

1638
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
SO I WOULD ASK ALL OF US NEVER

1639
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
TO USE THE NAME OF THE SHOOTER

1640
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
EVER.

1641
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
>> WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT.

1642
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
AT THE SAME TIME --

1643
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
>> IT'S A DIFFICULT THING, AND

1644
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
OF COURSE WE HAVE A CONSTITUTION

1645
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
AND A FIRST AMENDMENT.

1646
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
BUT WE ALSO HAVE JUDGMENT AND

1647
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
DISCERNMENT.

1648
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
WE KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT WE

1649
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
DON'T SHOW THE BODIES OF

1650
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
VICTIMS.
I THINK THAT WE CAN TREATED THIS

1651
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
WITH A BIT MORE SENSITIVITY TO

1652
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
SOME OF THE DYNAMICS THAT GO IN

1653
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
TO CREATING THESE MASS SHOOTERS

1654
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
WHO APPARENTLY WANT ALL OF THE

1655
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
NATION AND ALL OF THE WORLD'S

1656
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
ATTENTION ON THEM.

1657
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
>> I'M GOING TO STOP YOU THERE.

1658
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING.

1659
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE'S VOICE IN

1660
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
MY EAR.
BEFORE I CARRY ON A CONVERSATION

1661
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL, I NEED TO

1662
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

1663
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
MARIA, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A

1664
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
FIRST QUESTION AND ASK AMY TO

1665
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
RESPOND.
GUYS IN THE CONTROL ROOM, YOU'VE

1666
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
GOT TO GET THIS VOICE THAT'S

1667
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
BEING REPORTED OUT OF MY EAR.

1668
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
MARIA, FOR YOU, YOU LAID OUT

1669
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
SOMETHING TO DO -- I DON'T KNOW

1670
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
THAT I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT

1671
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
THAT'S MEANINGFUL ACTION.

1672
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
WHAT YOU HAVE DESCRIBED, THE

1673
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN, IT WOULDN'T

1674
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
DO ANYTHING IN THIS PARTICULAR

1675
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
CASE.
AMY, WHAT YOU LAID OUT ALSO

1676
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING

1677
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
SPECIFICALLY AND REALISTICALLY,

1678
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
RIGHT?

1679
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I MEAN NOT SAYING THE SHOOTER'S

1680
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
NAME, I AGREE 100%.

1681
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE

1682
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
ANYTHING ABOUT THE NEXT SHOOTING
THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AT SOME

1683
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
POINT.
GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND

1684
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
TELL ME WHAT MEANINGFUL ACTION

1685
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
THAT COULD STOP SHOOTINGS WOULD

1686
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
BE AND MAYBE THE ANSWER IS THERE

1687
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
IS NONE.

1688
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
THEN I'D LIKE TO HEAR THAT.

1689
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
MARIA?
>> SURE.

1690
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
MAYBE, AND YOU COULD BE RIGHT.

1691
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I THINK WHERE WE CAN STAND TO --

1692
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
WHERE WE CAN START IS ACTUALLY

1693
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
THINGS THAT MAKE SENSE.

1694
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, IN THIS

1695
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
PARTICULAR INSTANCE, SOLEDAD,

1696
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
PERHAPS THE BAN ON THE ASSAULT

1697
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
WEAPON WOULD NOT HAVE MADE ANY

1698
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
DIFFERENCE.

1699
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT TIME?

1700
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
AND WHAT IF HE HAD HAD THIS WITH

1701
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
HIM, THE CARNAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN

1702
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
MUCH WORSE THAN IT WAS.

1703
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
AND SO WE HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT

1704
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THIS

1705
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

1706
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT

1707
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
JUST HAPPENED.

1708
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT

1709
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
NEXT TIME.

1710
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
AGAIN, I SAY THE --

1711
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
>> I'M GOING INTERRUPT YOU.

1712
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING

1713
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
YOU.
WHILE WE FIX OUR AUDIO, I'LL

1714
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
STOP YOU THERE.

1715
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I KNOW THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT

1716
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000

00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000

1781
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000

01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
THEY PLAN TO RELEASE THE NAMES

1816
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
SHORTLY.
CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATORS ARE

1817
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK.

1818
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
>> WE STILL HAVE MAJOR CRIME

1819
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
DETECTIVES AND NEWTOWN

1820
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
DETECTIVES WORKING AT THE SCENE
IN THE SCHOOL.

1821
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
THAT IS NOT COMPLETED.

1822
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
THAT PROBABLY WILL NOT BE

1823
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
COMPLETED FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER

1824
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
DAY AND A HALF TO TWO DAYS.

1825
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I'M PUTTING A TIME LIMIT ON IT,

1826
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
IT COULD TAKE LONGER.

1827
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
AS I EXPLAINED AT PREVIOUS PRESS

1828
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
CONFERENCES, WE'VE DONE
EVERYTHING WE NEED TO DO TO

1829
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
LITERALLY PEEL BACK THE ONION

1830
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
LAYER BY LAYER AND EXAMINE EVERY

1831
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
CRACK AND CREVICE OF THAT

1832
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
FACILITY.
AND THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE OR

1833
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
EXCLUDE I SHOULD SAY THE OUTSIDE

1834
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
OF THE BUILDING.

1835
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING'S

1836
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
ALSO PART OF THE CRIME SCENE,

1837
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
EVERY SINGLE VEHICLE IN THAT

1838
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
LOT.
SO IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG,

1839
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
PAINSTAKING PROCESS.

1840
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
THE SECONDARY CRIME SCENE WAS

1841
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
DISCOVERED PURSUANT TO THE

1842
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
INVESTIGATION.
ONCE WE HAD A TENTATIVE

1843
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
IDENTIFICATION OF THE SUSPECT,
WE BEGAN DOING A GREAT DEAL OF

1844
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
WORK.
AGAIN, PEELING BACK THE ONION,

1845
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
EVERYTHING WE COULD FIND OUT

1846
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
ABOUT THE SUSPECT INCLUDING AND

1847
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
NOT LIMITED TO RELATIVES,

1848
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
FRIENDS, CO-WORKERS, FORMER

1849
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
STUDENTS, LOCATION OF RESIDENTS.

1850
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
AND ALL THOSE AREAS HAD TO BE --

1851
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
PEOPLE HAD TO BE INTERVIEWED AND

1852
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
AREAS HAD TO BE EXAMINED.

1853
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
HENCE THAT CAUSED US TO

1854
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
DISCOVERY THE SECONDARY CRIME

1855
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
SCENE, A PRIVATE RESIDENCE WITH

1856
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
A SOLE FEMALE DECEASED.

1857
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
>> THAT WOMAN IS IDENTIFIED AS

1858
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
NANCY LANZA.

1859
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
SHE'S THE MOTHER OF THE SHOOTER

1860
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
IDENTIFIED AS 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM

1861
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
LAN

1862
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
LANZA.
POLICE HAVE GATHERED WHAT THEY

1863
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
CALL GOOD EVIDENCE ON THE

1864
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,000
POSSIBLE MOTIVE FOR THIS DEADLY

1865
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
PAM RAGE.

1866
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
THEY'RE NOT RELEASE -- RAMPAGE.

1867
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
THEY'RE NOT RELEASING THAT

1868
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
YESTERDAY.
WE EXPECT THAT AHEAD.

1869
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WHO WERE INSIDE
THE SCHOOL DURING THE SHOOTING

1870
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
ARE STARTING TO COME FORWARD TO

1871
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
DESCRIBE THEIR HARROWING ORDEAL.

1872
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
EARLIER THIS MORNING, THE

1873
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
SCHOOL'S LIBRARIAN DESCRIBED

1874
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
WHAT SHE DID WHEN SHE REALIZED

1875
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG WAS

1876
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
GOING ON.

1877
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
>> EVERYBODY DOES WHAT THEY HAVE

1878
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
TO DO WHEN THEY'RE CONFRONTED

1879
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
WITH A SITUATION LIKE THAT.

1880
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
AND EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW, WE

1881
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
PRACTICED IT, AND THEY KNEW WHAT

1882
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
TO DO.

1883
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
AND YOU JUST -- YOU THINK ABOUT

1884
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
PROTECTING THE KIDS AND DOING

1885
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
THE RIGHT THING.
>> HOW HAD YOU PRACTICED THIS?

1886
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
>> WE HAVE LOCKDOWN DRILLS.

1887
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MANY, BUT

1888
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
THERE'S RULES.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN

1889
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
NUMBER OF FIRE DRILLS,

1890
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
EVACUATION DRILLS, LOCKDOWN

1891
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
DRILLS.

1892
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
EVERYONE HAS A ROUTINE, EVERYONE

1893
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
HAS A SPOT IN THE ROOM THEY'RE

1894
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
SUPPOSED TO GO TO.
>> CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE SPOT?

1895
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
>> IN THE LIBRARY IT'S BETWEEN

1896
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
BOOK CASES AGAINST A WALL WHERE

1897
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
YOU CAN'T BE SEEN FROM ANY

1898
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
WINDOW.
WE HAD TO MOVE OUT OF THE SPOT

1899
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
BECAUSE ONE OF OUR DOORS WASN'T

1900
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
LOCKED WE DISCOVERED.

1901
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
WE WENT TO A BACK STORAGE ROOM.

1902
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
>> HOW CLOSE --
>> WE WERE LIKE THIS CLOSE

1903
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
TOGETHER.
>> HOW DID YOU KEEP THE CHILDREN

1904
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
QUIET?
>> THERE WAS CRAYONS AND PAPER

1905
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
IN THE BACK.

1906
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
WE TORE SOME UP AND GAVE THEM

1907
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
CLIPBOARDS.
>> WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?

1908
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
>> WERE YOU ALONE?

1909
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
>> THERE WERE THREE OTHER

1910
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
ADULTS.
THEY WERE ASKING WHAT WAS GOING

1911
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
ON, WE SAID WE DON'T KNOW, OUR

1912
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
JOB IS TO STAY QUIET.

1913
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
IT MAY BE A DRILL, IT MAY NOT.

1914
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
>> WHAT DID YOU KNOW AT THAT

1915
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
POINT?

1916
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
>> WE KNEW.
I CALLED THE OFFICE, AND SHE

1917
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
TOLD ME THERE WAS A SHOOTER.

1918
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
>> ONCE AGAIN, THERE ARE

1919
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS UNFOLDING

1920
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
RIGHT NOW.

1921
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
WE'RE HERE IN NEWTOWN,

01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
WE WANT TO WELCOME OUR VIEWERS
NOT ONLY HERE IN THE UNITED

1927
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
ARE WATCHING.

1928
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
THIS STORY CERTAINLY HAS

1929
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
RESONATED AROUND THE WORLD.

1930
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
CERTAINLY LEFT WITH A LOT OF

1931
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
QUESTIONS THAT STILL NEED

1932
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000

THE 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA.

1935
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
POLICE SAY THEY HAVE A GOOD

1936
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
SENSE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.

1937
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
THEY HAVEN'T RELEASED THE

1938
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
INFORMATION YET.
SAY HE KILLED HIS MOTHER BEFORE

1939
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
THE RAMPAGE AT THE SCHOOL WHERE

1940
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
HE THEN TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.

WHAT HAVE WE LEARN GOOD ADAM

LANZA, THIS 20-YEAR-OLD MAN?

1946
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
ARE WE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE

1947
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
MOTIVE?
THE POLICE SEEM TO THINK THEY

1948
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT

1949
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
WAS GOING ON.

1950
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000

1953
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
YESTERDAY'S HORRIFIC SHOOTING,

1954
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
POLICE WERE ON THE SCENE HERE AT

01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000

AND LIEUTENANT PAUL VANCE

1959
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
INDICATED THAT THEY ARE PICKING

01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
UP INFORMATION PIECING TOGETHER,

1961
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
POSSIBLY COULD LEAD TO THE

1962
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
MOTIVE.
HE WAS ASKED AT THE PRESS

1963
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
CONFERENCE JUST A SHORT TIME AGO

1964
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
ABOUT WHETHER THERE WERE ANY

1965
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,000
EMAILS OR MIGHTINWRITINGS THAT

01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
WHERE THE FEMALE WAS LOCATED

1971
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
DECEASED DID PRODUCE SOME VERY

1972
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
-- VERY GOOD EVIDENCE IN THIS

1973
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
INVESTIGATION THAT OUR

1974
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
INVESTIGATORS WILL BE ABLE TO

1975
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
USE IN HOPEFULLY PAINTEDING THE

01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
COMPLETE PICTURE AS TO HOW AND

1977
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,000
MORE IMPORTANTLY WHY THIS
OCCURRED.

1978
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
>> Reporter: THE SECONDARY CRIME

1979
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,000

YOU CAN'T SEE IT BEHIND ME, IT'S

1982
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
BLOCKED BY POLICE.

1983
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
BUT THE BODY OF THE SUSPECT'S

1984
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
MOTHER WAS FOUND IN THE HOME

1985
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
YESTERDAY.
AS FOR WHAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT

1986
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
THE SUSPECT FROM NEIGHBORS HERE,

1987
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
MANY ARE SAYING THIS WAS A KID

1988
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:50,000
WHO WAS QUIET, WHO WAS DIFFERENT

1989
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
IN SOME ESTIMATES, HE WAS CALLED

1990
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
TROUBLED.
WE HEARD THE FAMILY WAS NOT THAT

1991
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
SOCIAL.
THEY DIDN'T REALLY KNOW TOO MUCH

1992
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000

SHOOTING, GO TO CNN.COM/IMPACT.

YOUR WORLD.

2184
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
AS WE SAY, AS WE'VE BEEN

2185
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
REPORTING, THREE WEAPONS WERE

2186
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
FOUND AT THE SCHOOL.

2187
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
TWO SEMIAUTOMATIC PISTOLS AND A

2188
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
BUSHMASTER ASSAULT RIFLE.

2189
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
ALL BELONG TO ADAM LANZA'S

2190
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
MOTHER, NANCY LANZA.

2191
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER FBI

2192
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
DIRECTOR TOM FUENTES JOINS US

2193
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
FROM WASHINGTON.

2194
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
DEBORAH FEYERICK IS JOINING US.

2195
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
TOM, FIRST YOU TO.

2196
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,000
THESE ARE HIGH-POWERED GUNS

2197
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
THE

2198
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
THERE.
YOU OBVIOUSLY DOWNTOWN WAN'T WAN

2199
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
THE WRONG HANDS.

2200
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
CONNECTICUT HAS STRONG LAWS ON

2201
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
THE BOOKS NOW.

2202
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
HOW DID THE YOUNG ADAM LANZA,

2203
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
20-YEAR-OLD, GET THESE WEAPONS?

2204
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
>> HI, WOLF.
SO FAR WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE

2205
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
HOW HE GOT THEM.

2206
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
THE REPORTS ARE THAT HIS MANAGER

2207
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
LEGALLY PURCHASED THE WEAPONS

2208
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
AND LEGALLY HAD THEM IN THE

2209
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
HOUSE, IT FOLLOWED ALL OF THE

2210
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
LAWS OF CONNECTICUT.

2211
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
BUT IF HE WENT AHEAD AND STOLE

2212
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
THEM FROM HIS MOTHER AND THEN

2213
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
ACTUALLY USED THEM AGAINST HER

2214
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,000
AND THE OTHER CHILDREN, THEN

2215
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM COMES

2216
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
IN.
SHE MAY HAVE OBTAINED THE GUNS

2217
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
LEGALLY, BUT HE DIDN'T.

2218
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
HE BASICALLY WOULD HAVE STOLEN

2219
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
THE WEAPONS.

2220
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
>> HOW POPULAR OUT THERE ARE

2221
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
THESE THREE KINDS OF WEAPONS?

2222
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
THE TWO PISTOLS, ONE RIFLE?

2223
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
HOW POPULAR OUT THERE ARE THEY

2224
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
GENERALLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY?

2225
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
>> THEY'RE POPULAR BECAUSE THE

2226
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
GLOCK AND THE SIG SAUER PISTOLS

2227
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
ARE PROFESSIONAL,

2228
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
TOP-OF-THE-LINE QUALITY.

2229
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
THEY'RE CARRIED BY MOST LAW

2230
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS, FEDERAL,

2231
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
STATE, AND LOCAL THROUGHOUT THE

2232
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
UNITED STATES BECAUSE THEY'RE

2233
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
TOP-QUALITY REPRY.

2234
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
T
THE BUSHMASTER IS A SPINOFF OR

2235
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:43,000
NON- AUTOMATAUTOMATIC VERSION OS

2236
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
FIRING THAT .223 BULLET WHICH IS

2237
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
VERY, VERY LETHAL.

2238
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:51,000
IT'S A MILITARY-GRADIVELY WITH E

2239
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
WEAP

2240
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
-- GRADE WEAPON.
THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT FULLY

2241
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
AUTOMATIC DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT

2242
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
VERY LEETHD THAL.

2243
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
>> DEB, GO AHEAD.

2244
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
>> ONE OF THE QUESTIONS, TOM,

2245
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
YOU'VE WORKED A NUMBER OF CASES

2246
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
LIKE THIS.

2247
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
WHY NOT JUST KILL YOURSELF?

2248
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
WHY GO AFTER PEOPLE WHO ARE THE

2249
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
MOST VULNERABLE?
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT

2250
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
THE SHOOTER?

2251
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO SAY.

2252
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
WHAT WAS IN HIS MIND OR ON HIS

2253
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
MIND AT THE TIME HE CARRIED ALL

2254
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
THESE ACTIONS OUT, WE'LL

2255
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
PROBABLY NEVER KNOW FOR SURE.

2256
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I KNOW EXPERTS ARE GOING TO

2257
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
THEORIZE THIS IS WHAT HE WAS

2258
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
THINKING, THIS IS WHY HE DID IT,

2259
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
OR HE WANTS HIS 15 MINUTES OF

2260
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
FAME BY DOING A HORRENDOUS ACT

2261
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
THAT WOULD OBTAIN WORLDWIDE

2262
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
MEDIA ATTENTION AND FAME FOR

2263
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
HIM.
BUT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.

2264
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TRIGGERED HIM

2265
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
TO TAKE THIS OUT.

2266
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:46,000
AND UNFORTUNATELY, HOOS NE'S NO

2267
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
AVAILABLE TO ASK AND MIGHT NOT

2268
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
HAVE BEEN HONEST IF HE DID

2269
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
SURVIVE.

2270
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
HIS MOTHER WOULD KNOW HIM BEST.

2271
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
AND SHE'S NOT AVAILABLE TO ASK

2272
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
WHAT WAS ON HER SON'S MIND.

2273
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
WE DON'T KNOW, AND WE MAY NEVER

2274
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
KNOW.
>> AND OUT OF CURIOSITY, DO YOU

2275
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
KNOW IN THESE KINDS OF

2276
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
SITUATIONS WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS

2277
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
INTENT ON DOING SOMETHING, IS

2278
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
THERE A MOMENT WHERE SOMEBODY

2279
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
CAN INTERCEDE, WHERE SOMEBODY

2280
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
CAN TRY TO TALK THEM DOWN FROM

2281
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
WHAT IT IS THEY'RE DOING, OR

2282
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
ONCE THEY'RE IN, ARE THEY

2283
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
COMMITTED TO CARRYING OUT THIS

2284
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
KIND OF HORROR?

2285
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
>> THEY MAY BE COMMITTED.

2286
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
AND THIS BRINGS UP A WHOLE OTHER

2287
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
TOUCHY SUBJECT.

2288
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
THAT IS, THE MENTAL HEALTH

2289
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES.

2290
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
PARENTS REPORT REPEATEDLY HOW

2291
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
HELPLESS THEY FEEL IN TERMS OF

2292
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
BEING ABLE TO CALL THE POLICE

2293
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
AND SAY, "I THINK MY SON'S OUT

2294
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
OF CONTROL, I THINK HE'S GOING

2295
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,000
TO DO A TERRIBLE THING."

2296
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
UNFORTUNATELY, UNTIL THAT

2297
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
TORNADO DOPERSON

2298
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
DOES THE TERRIBLE THING, THERE'S

2299
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
NOT MUCH WE CAN DO SO IT'S

2300
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
PREVENTED.
SO WE HAVE A VERY INADEQUATE

2301
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM, AND IT'S

2302
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF

2303
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
RESOURCES AND CHANGES IN THE LAW

2304
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE AND TO

2305
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
GIVE PARENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS

2306
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DOCTORS

2307
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
THE ABILITY TO INTERVENE AND TRY

2308
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
TO DO SOMETHING BEFORE SOMEBODY

2309
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
GOES OFF THE EDGE LIKE HE DID,

2310
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
IF THEY KNOW THAT'S COMING.

2311
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
IN SOME CASES THAT MAY NOT BE

2312
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,000
CLEAR THAT IT'S PREVENTABLE.

2313
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
PROBABLY A LARGE NUMBER WOULD BE

2314
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
PREVENTABLE IN THE FUTURE IF WE

2315
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
HAD THAT SYSTEM.

2316
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
THE ISSUES THAT COME UP IN THESE

2317
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
MASS SHOOTINGS ARE A COMBINATION

2318
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,000
OF AN INADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH

2319
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
SYSTEM AND TREMENDOUS

2320
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
AVAILABILITY OF HIGH-POWER

2321
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
WEAPONS THROUGHOUT OUR SOCIETY.

2322
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
>> WOLF, I'M SURE YOU'RE SEEING

2323
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
IT THERE ON THE GROUND IN TERMS

2324
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
OF PEOPLE ASKING WAS THERE A

2325
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
MOTIVE.
IN THE END, WOLF, I'M SURE THE

2326
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
ANSWER YOU'RE GETTING IS IT

2327
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
DOESN'T MATTER THAT THERE'S A

2328
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
MOTIVE.

2329
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
YOU'VE GOT 26 PEOPLE, 27 PEOPLE

2330
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,000
WHO ARE DEAD NOW, WOLF.

2331
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
>> YEAH, A SAD STORY, INDEED.

2332
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
TOM, WE DID LEARN TWO IMPORTANT

2333
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
NUGGETS FROM THE CONNECTICUT

2334
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
STATE POLICE, LIEUTENANT PAUL

2335
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
VANCE, WHO JUST SPOKE TO

2336
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
REPORTERS HERE.

2337
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
FIRST THING HE POINTED OUT -- I

2338
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
WANT YOUR REACTION.

2339
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
HE SAID OUR INVESTIGATIONS DID

2340
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
PRODUCE GOOD EVIDENCE IN THIS
INVESTIGATION THAT OUR

2341
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
INVESTIGATORS WILL BE ABLE TO

2342
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
USE TO PAINT A COMPLETE PICTURE.

2343
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
SO WHAT -- WHEN YOU HEAR THAT

2344
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
FROM THE CONNECTICUT STATE

2345
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
POLICE, WHAT ARE YOU -- WHAT DO

2346
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
YOU THINK?

2347
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
WHAT KIND OF EVIDENCE DID THEY

2348
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
PRODUCE AT THE CRIME SCENE?

2349
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
DID THEY FIND AT THE CRIME SCENE

2350
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
THAT HELPS ALL OF US BETTER

2351
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
UNDERSTAND WHY THIS COULD

2352
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
HAPPEN?
>> THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT

2353
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
THE SHOOTER MAY HAVE BEEN

2354
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
CARRYING SOME TYPE OF A NOTE OR

2355
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
PERSONAL MANIFESTO WHERE HE'S

2356
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
SAYING GOOD-BYE TO THE WORLD.

2357
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
AND INDICATING THROUGH THAT WHY

2358
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
HE WANTS TO DO THIS.

2359
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
WE DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE.

2360
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
BUT CERTAINLY THAT'S POSSIBLE

2361
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
THAT HE MAY HAVE HAD SOMETHING

2362
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
ON HIS PERSON OR AROUND HIS BODY

2363
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
THAT -- THAT IS USEFUL FOR THE

2364
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
INVESTIGATORS TO TRY TO FIND OUT

2365
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
WHAT THE MOTIVE WAS OR HAVE AN

2366
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
INDICATION OF MOTIVE.

2367
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,000
THAT COULD BE -- ONE OF THE

2368
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
THINGS HE COULD HAVE SAID TO

2369
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
SOMEBODY THAT HASN'T BEEN MADE

2370
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
PUBLIC YET.

2371
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
THAT'S ANOTHER POSSIBILITY FROM
THE CRIME SCENE.

2372
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
THOSE THINGS -- AGAIN, THE

2373
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
PAPERWORK THAT WAS WITH HIM, THE

2374
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
WALLET THAT HE WAS CARRYING, AND

2375
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
ANY COMMENTS HE MAY HAVE MADE

2376
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
PRIOR TO TAKING HIS OWN LIFE MAY

2377
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
BE WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

2378
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
>> AND THE OTHER NUGGET, THE

2379
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
OTHER NEW PIECE OF INFORMATION

2380
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
THAT THE CONNECTICUT STATE

2381
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
POLICE SPOKESMAN SAID, IT WAS

2382
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
THE SHOOTER -- AND I'M BEING

2383
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
SPECIFIC, IT'S THE SHOOTER

2384
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
FORCED HIS WAY INTO THE SCHOOL.

2385
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
SO MAYBE THE DOORS WERE LOCKED.

2386
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
HE FORCED HIS WAY, WHAT DOES

2387
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
THAT SAY TO YOU?

2388
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
>> WELL, THAT -- PEOPLE HAVE

2389
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
TALKED ABOUT THIS GREAT SECURITY

2390
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
SYSTEM THEY HAD.

2391
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
AND ESSENTIALLY, IT'S A LOCKED

2392
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
DOOR WITH A DOORBELL AND CAMERA

2393
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
WHERE SOMEBODY IN THE FRONT

2394
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
OFFICE CAN BUZZ PEOPLE IN IF

2395
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
THEY RECOGNIZE THEM OR GO TO THE

2396
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
DOOR AND HAVE THEM PRODUCE AN

2397
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I.D. AND SAY WHY THEY'RE AT THE

2398
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
SCHOOL, WHAT PURPOSE THEY'VE

2399
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
COME FOR.

2400
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
SO IN THIS CASE, WE DON'T KNOW,

2401
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
THERE WERE SOME REPORTS THAT HE

2402
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
SHOT THE DOOR, SHOT THE GLASS,

2403
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
AND ALLOWED HIMSELF IN.

2404
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE -- HE MAY

2405
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
HAVE BUZZED AND SOMEONE CAME TO

2406
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
THE DOOR, AND THEN HE PUSHED IT

2407
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:05,000
OPEN WHEN THEY OPENED TO SEE

2408
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
IDENTIFICATION.

2409
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
AGAIN, THAT'S SOMETHING THEY'RE

2410
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
STILL HOLDING CLOSELY IN TERMS
OF THE INVESTIGATION AS HOW

2411
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
EXACTLY HE MADE THAT ENTRY.

2412
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
>> THE PICTURE IS BEGINNING TO

2413
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
BECOME LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLETE,

2414
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
BUT THERE ARE STILL SO MANY

2415
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.

2416
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000

INNOCENCE HAS BEEN TORN AWAY FAR

2428

TOO EARLY.

2429
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000

JUST IN THEIR OWN MEMORIES BUT

SOUND OF CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS

2531

GAVE PERMISSION.
AS ONE WOMAN WALKED AWAY FROM

01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
THE SCHOOL SHE WAS HEARD CRY,

2533
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
"WHY, WHY?"

2534
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
A POLICEMAN WAS HEARD SAYING, IT

2535
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
WAS THE WORST THING HE'D SEEN IN

2536
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
HIS CAREER.
A NURSE FROM NEARBY DANBURY

2537
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
HOSPITAL DESCRIBED THE SCENE AS

2538
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
PARENTS WAITED FOR WORD ABOUT

2539
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
THEIR CHILDREN.

2540
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
>> ALL THESE PARENTS WERE

2541
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
WAITING FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO

2542
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
COME OUT.
THEY THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE

2543
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
STILL ALIVE.
THERE WERE 20 PARENTS WHO WERE

2544
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
JUST TOLD THEIR CHILDREN WERE

2545
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
DEAD.
IT WAS AWFUL.

TRYING TO PROCESS IT ALL.

2549
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
>> IT WAS SHOCKING.

2550
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
I GOT THE CALL AT WORK THIS

2551
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
MORNING.
I CAN'T BELIEVE A SMALL TOWN

2552
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
LIKE THIS WOULD EVER HAVE

2553
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN.

2554
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,000
AND TO BE IN AN ELEMENTARY

2555
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
SCHOOL, THAT'S UNHEARD OF.

2557
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
AFTERNOON AND INTO THE EVENING,

2558
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
EVACUATED CHILDREN WERE BEING

>>> SUSAN CANDIOTTI HAS JOINED

2563
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
ME IN CONNECTICUT, NEWTOWN.

2564
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
SUSAN, YOU'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING

2565
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
WHAT HAPPENED, YOU'RE GETTING

2566
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
NEW INFORMATION.

2567
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
UPDATE OUR VIEWERS.

2568
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
>> ALL RIGHT.

2569
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
FIRST THING THAT IS NEW, WE WANT

2570
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
TO TALK ABOUT, ARE THE THREE

2571
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
GUNS THAT WE'VE ALREADY BEEN

2572
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
IDENTIFYING.

2573
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
THE GLOCK, THE SIG SAUER, AND

2574
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
THE BUSHMASTER, THAT UP UNTIL

2575
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
NOW WE HAVE REPORTED THAT THAT

2576
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC BUSHMASTER WAS

2577
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
FOUND IN THE MOTHER'S CAR

2578
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
BELONGED -- THAT THE SHOOTER WAS

2579
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
USING PARKED OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.

2580
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,000
NEW INFORMATION IS THAT ALL

2581
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
THREE OF THOSE GUNS WERE INSIDE,

2582
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
NEXT TO THE SHOOTER IN THE

2583
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
CLASSROOM.
IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THERE WAS

2584
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
ANOTHER WEAPON FOUND AT THE

2585
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
CRIME SCENE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

2586
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
>> IN ADDITION TO THOSE THREE?

2587
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

2588
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:43,000
HOWEVER, WE DO HAVE THIS NEW

2589
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:48,000
INFORMATION.

2590
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
AUTHORITIES ARE TRACING THREE

2591
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
MORE GUNS THAT THE SHOOTER MAY

2592
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
HAVE HAD ACCESS TO.

2593
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
WE'RE DOING A FULL TRACE ON ALL

2594
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
OF THESE GUNS.

2595
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
THE THREE ADDITIONAL GUNS ARE

2596
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
DESCRIBED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT

2597
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
SOURCES AS SINGLE-ACTION RIFLES

2598
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
OF VARIOUS CALIBERS.

2599
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,000
SO THEY ARE CONDUCTING, WE HAVE

2600
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
THE MAKES AND MODELS.
THEY ARE CONDUCTING A FULL TRACE

2601
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
TO SEE WHETHER THEY BELONG TO

2602
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
THE MOTHER, WHERE THEY BELONG TO

2603
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
THE FATHER, WHETHER THEY MIGHT

2604
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
HAVE BELONGED TO BOTH.

2605
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,000
BUT AUTHORITIES INCLUDING BUREAU

2606
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND

2607
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
FIREARMS, IS CURRENTLY DOING A

2608
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
TRACE ON THESE WEAPONS.

2609
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT VARIOUS

2610
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
SPORTING GOODS STORES, GUN

2611
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
RANGES, THIS KIND OF THING, TO

2612
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
FIND OUT WHETHER THE SHOOTER IN

2613
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
THIS CASE VISITED ANY OF THOSE

2614
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
PLACES.

2615
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
IN FACT, ANOTHER SOURCE TELLS ME

2616
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
THAT THEY HAVE INFORMATION THAT

2617
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
THE SHOOTER MAY HAVE TRIED TO

2618
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
PURCHASE A WEAPON BUT WAS

2619
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
UNSUCCESSFUL ON TUESDAY OF THIS

2620
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
YEAR.
TRIED TO BUY A GUN BUT WAS

2621
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
UNABLE TO DO SO.
>> BECAUSE OF A BACKGROUND CHECK

2622
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
OR WHATEVER?
>> I AM TOLD HE DIDN'T HAVE A

2623
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
PROPER PERMIT.

2624
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
AND REMEMBER, HE WAS 20 YEARS

2625
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
OLD.
NOW THAT MIGHT MEAN THAT HE HAD

2626
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
A FAKE I.D. AT THE TIME, BUT I'M

2627
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
TOLD THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE THE

2628
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
PROPER PERMIT IN ADDITION TO

2629
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
WHAT OTHER SPECIFICATIONS HE

2630
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
DIDN'T HAVE OR REQUIREMENTS, AND

2631
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
HE DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT.

2632
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
>> AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE

2633
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
REPORTS HE DID HAVE HIS OLDER

2634
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
BROTHER'S I.D. ON HIS BODY,

2635
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
24-YEAR-OLD RYAN LANZA.

2636
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
THAT WAS -- APPARENTLY THE

2637
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,000
RESULT, CAUSING THAT YOU WILL

2638
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
CONFUSION WHO SHOOTER SERVICE

2639
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
ORIGINALLY.

2640
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
HE DID HAVE SOME I.D. ON HIS

2641
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
BODY THAT SUGGESTED HE WAS RYAN

2642
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
AS OPPOSED TO ADAM LANZA.

2643
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
>> THERE ARE REPORTS ABOUT THAT,

2644
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
AND CERTAINLY IF THAT IS THE

2645
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
CASE, THAT MIGHT BE AN

2646
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
EXPLANATION FOR HIM GOING INTO A

2647
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
GUN STORE AND TRYING TO MAKE A

2648
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
PURCHASE.

2649
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
>> DO WE KNOW IF THE THREE
WEAPONS THAT THEY WERE

2650
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
DISCOVERED INSIDE THE SCHOOL,

2651
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
THE BUSHMASTER, GLOCK, THE SIG

2652
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
SAUER, WERE THEY ALL FIRED?

2653
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
WERE THEY ALL USED?
>> I'VE BEEN UNABLE TO CONFIRM

2654
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
THAT, BUT I DID ASK THIS --

2655
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
WHICH ONE OF THOSE HE USED TO

2656
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
COMMIT SUICIDE.
AND I WAS TOLD THEY DO KNOW BUT

2657
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
THEY WILL NOT REVEAL THAT AT

2658
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
THIS TIME.

2659
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
>> WAS THERE A LOT OF AMMUNITION

2660
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
THAT WAS STILL USABLE ON THE

2661
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
SCENE OR DID HE GO THROUGH ALL

2662
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
THE BULLETS?

2663
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
>> I'VE BEEN ASKING THAT

2664
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
QUESTION AND I DON'T HAVE AN

2665
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
ANSWER TO THAT.
AS YOU KNOW, THEY'RE CURRENTLY

2666
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
STILL WORKING THAT CRIME SCENE,

2667
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:24,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY

2668
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
BULLET WERE FIRED, IF THERE WAS

2669
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
ADDITIONAL AMMO.
THOSE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

2670
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
AND CERTAINLY ONE THAT

2671
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
INVESTIGATORS EITHER KNOW AND

2672
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
AREN'T REVEALING OR ARE STILL

2673
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
LOOKING INTO.
>> I THINK THEY KNOW A LOT MORE

2674
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
THAN THEY'RE REVEALING NOW.

2675
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
TO THEIR CREDIT, THEY WANT TO BE

2676
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
PRECISE.

2677
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE
INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE TO

2678
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
LATER WALK BACK AND -- I ADMIRE

2679
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
THEM FOR DOING THAT.
>> TRYING TO BE VERY CAREFUL.

2680
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
>> THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A TRAGEDY

2681
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
THAT HAS SO RESONATED NOT ONLY

2682
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
IN CONNECTICUT BUT ALL OVER THE

2683
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
COUNTRY, INDEED ALL OVER THE

2684
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
WORLD RIGHT NOW.

2685
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,000
THEY WANT TO BE -- TO BE

2686
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
PRECISE.

2687
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
WE'LL GET MORE INFORMATION.

2688
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
ARE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE

2689
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
TAKING THE LEAD?

2690
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
>> THEY ARE, BUT THEY'VE

2691
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
ACKNOWLEDGED THEY'RE GETTING A

2692
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
LOT OF COOPERATION FROM THE FBI,

2693
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
FROM THE ATF, AND ANY OTHER

2694
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
AGENCIES THEY'RE ASKING.

2695
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
THEY'RE GETTING IT, AND IT'S

2696
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
HELPING ADVANCE WHAT THEY'RE

2697
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,000
DOING.
>> SUSAN CANDIOTTI, WOKKING HER

2698
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
SOURC

2699
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
-- WORKING HER SOURCES, GETTING

2700
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
INFORMATION.
TO REPEAT THE HEADLINE, ALL

2701
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
THREE WEAPONS WERE FOUND INSIDE

2702
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
BECAUSE ORIGINALLY WE THOUGHT

2703
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
THE RIFLE WAS STILL IN THE

2704
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
VEHICLE THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL

2705
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
DROVE TO THE SCHOOL.

2706
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

2707
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
AND THAT HE MAY HAVE HAD ACCESS

01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
RE-CREATING THE CRIME SCENE FROM

2889
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
BEGINNING TO END TO MAKE SURE WE

2890
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

2891
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
HLN'S LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST

2892
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
MIKE BROOKS IS JOINING US,

2893
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,000
DEBORAH FEYERICK STILL WITH US.

2894
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
MIKE, THESE PEOPLE ARE

2895
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
PROFESSIONALS, INVESTIGATORS,

2896
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
THEY HAVE TO DO THIS EXTREMELY

2897
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
DIFFICULT WORK TO RE-CREATE IN

2898
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
EFFECT EVERY ONE OF THOSE

2899
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:23,000
MINUTES IF NOT SECONDS OF WHAT

2900
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
UNFOLDED.

2901
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
WALK US THROUGH WHAT THEY ARE

2902
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
DOING NOW AND WHY THEY'RE DOING

2903
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
IT.

2904
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
>> YOU HEARD FROM LIEUTENANT

2905
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
VANCE OF THE CONNECTICUT STATE

2906
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
POLICE THAT THEY WILL BE THERE

2907
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
AT THE SCHOOL AT LEAST FOR

2908
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
ANOTHER DAY AND A HALF, TWO

2909
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
DAYS.

2910
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
EVEN MORE IF THEY NEED THAT

2911
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
TIME.
WE KNOW THAT THE BODIES HAVE

2912
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
BEEN REMOVED.

2913
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
THEY ARE UNDERGOING AUTOPSY AT

2914
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE.

2915
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
THAT EVIDENCE WILL BE ANALYZED

2916
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
BY A CRIME LAB.

2917
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
BUT BACK AT THE SCHOOL, YOU

2918
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
STILL HAVE CRIME TEAM -- CRIME

2919
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
SCENE TECHNICIANS.

2920
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
YOU SAID THEY HAVE THREE MAJOR

2921
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
CASE SQUADS THAT ARE GOING OVER

2922
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:59,000
THAT SCHOOL WITH A FINE TOOTH

2923
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
COMB, BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE.

2924
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
WOLF, WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW

2925
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
MANY ROUNDS WERE FIRED IN THAT

2926
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
SCHOOL.
WE'RE HEARING WITNESS ACCOUNTS

2927
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
OF MAYBE 100 OR MORE.

2928
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
AND NOW THAT MAKES SENSE WITH

2929
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
THE NEW INFORMATION SUSAN

2930
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:17,000
CANDIOTTI HAS THAT THAT .223

2931
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
BU
BUSHMASTER WAS INSIDE WITH THE

2932
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
MAGAZINES WITH 30 ROUNDS EACH.

2933
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
SO ALL THOSE ROUNDS, THEY WILL

2934
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,000
TRY TO ACCOUNT FOR EVERY ONE OF

2935
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
THOSE ROUNDS, WOLF.

2936
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
AND THEY WILL TRY TO RE-CREATE

2937
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
THROUGH STILL PICTURES AND VI  O

2938
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
VIDEO, FINGERPRINT, DNA, WHAT

2939
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
HAPPENED.

2940
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
WE KNOW THE SCHOOL UPGRADED

2941
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
THEIR SECURITY SYSTEM AND HAD A

2942
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA AT THE FRONT
DOOR.

2943
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
THE OTHER QUESTION IS, WERE

2944
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
THERE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS

2945
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,000
THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL?
IF THERE WAS, THAT WILL ALSO

2946
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:55,000
HELP THEM RE-CREATE WHAT

2947
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
HAPPENED, RE-CREATE THE TIME

2948
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
LINE FROM WHEN HE DROVE UP,

2949
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
FORCED HIS WAY INTO THE SCHOOL,

2950
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
TO THE TIME HE WENT THROUGH THE

2951
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
SCHOOL JUST WREAKING HAVOC WITH

2952
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
THOSE THREE WEAPONS.

2953
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
>> POLICE SAY THEY NOW SAY THEY

2954
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,000
KNOW FOR A FACT HE DID FORCE HIS

2955
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
WAY INTO THAT SCHOOL.

2956
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
HE WAS DETERMINED TO GET INSIDE

2957
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
THAT SMALL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND

2958
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
START KILLING PEOPLE.

2959
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
THE QUESTION IS WHY WOULD ANYONE

2960
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
WANT TO DO THAT.

2961
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS,

2962
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
ALTHOUGH THE POLICE SAY, MIKE,

2963
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
THEY HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF

2964
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
WHY HE DID THIS.

2965
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
WHEN THEY SAY THAT, WHAT DOES

2966
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
THAT SAY TO YOU?

2967
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
>> THAT SAYS THAT THEY HAVE

2968
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
GLEANED SOME INFORMATION FROM

2969
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
EITHER THERE AT THE SCHOOL, HIS

2970
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
CAR, THE SECONDARY CRIME SCENE

2971
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
WHERE HIS MOTHER WAS FOUND DEAD,

2972
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
OR POSSIBLY ALSO THE INTERVIEWS

2973
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
THAT THEY'VE DONE WITH ALL OF

2974
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
HIS FRIENDS, HIS ASSOCIATES.

2975
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
WE KNOW THAT IN HOBOKEN, NEW

2976
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
JERSEY, HIS BROTHER RYAN WAS

2977
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
TAKEN INTO CUSTODY FOR A WHILE

2978
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,000
YESTERDAY AND QUESTIONED.

2979
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:02,000
AND POSSIBLY A COMPUTER TAKEN

2980
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
FROM HIS APARTMENT.

2981
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
AND HIS FATHER, I'M SURE HE WAS

2982
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
ABLE TO GIVE A PRETTY GOOD

2983
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
BACKGROUND, WOLF.

2984
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
AND THE SECONDARY CRIME SCENE AT

2985
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
THE HOUSE, THERE COULD HAVE

2986
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
BEEN.
THEY WENT OVER THAT HOUSE, I

2987
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
GUARANTEE YOU, WITH A FINE TOOTH

2988
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
COMB, TAKING ANY COMPUTERS, ANY

2989
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,000
LAPTOPS, YOU NAME IT, TO TRY TO

2990
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,000
GET INFORMATION ON THE HOW AND

2991
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
THE WHY ALL THIS HAPPENED.

2992
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
AND I THINK THAT WE'RE PROBABLY

2993
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,000
GOING TO HEAR OVER THE NEXT WEEK

2994
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:35,000
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE
I'M SURE THAT THEY HAVE GOOD

2995
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
INFORMATION.
>> DEB, LIKE ME, ALL OF US,

2996
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
WE'VE COVERED WAY TOO MANY OF

2997
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
THOSE HORRIFIC, HORRIFIC

2998
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
TRAGEDIES.

2999
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
AND UNFORTUNATELY AFTER EACH ONE

3000
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
WE HOPE THAT IT'S THE LAST BUT

3001
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
WE KNOW THERE WILL BE MORE

3002
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
TRAGEDIES DOWN THE ROAD.

3003
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I KNOW YOU WANT TO ASK MIKE A

3004
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
QUESTION.
>> AND THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS

3005
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
THAT HAVE TO BE ANSWERED PEOPLE

3006
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
SAY, WELL, WHAT WAS THE MOTIVE?

3007
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
WILL THERE BE A MOTIVE.

3008
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
AND TO A LOT OF THE FAMILIES,

3009
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
IT'S PROBABLY LIKE, WELL, IT

3010
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THERE'S A

3011
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,000
MOTIVE.
MY CHILD IS DEAD.

3012
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
THE BODIES ARE NOW WITH THE

3013
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER.
HOW LONG, MIKE, DOES THE PROCESS

3014
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
TAKE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE

3015
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:13,000
TURNED OVER TO THE FAMILIES, AND

3016
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
WHEN YOU DO FRIENDS ACTIVITIES A

3017
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:22,000
CHILD, A VICTIM, AN -- FORENSICS

3018
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
ON A CHILD, A VICTIM, AN ADULT,

3019
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
IS THERE A TIMELINE?

3020
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
>> YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE THE
CAUSE OF DEATH.

3021
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
THE MANNER IS MOST LIKELY

3022
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
HOMICIDE IN THIS CASE.

3023
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
BY LAW THEY HAVE TO FILL OUT A

3024
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
DEATH CERTIFICATE.
IT'S NOT A PLEASANT THING TO

3025
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
TALK ABOUT, BUT THEY HAVE TO

3026
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
FILL OUT A DEATH CERTIFICATE FOR

3027
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
EACH OF THE CHILDREN AND ADULT

3028
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
KILLED AT THE SCENE AS WELL AS

3029
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
THE SHOOTER.

3030
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,000
AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO GO

3031
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:52,000
THROUGH AN AUTOPSY LIKE THEY

3032
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,000
WOULD FORRIN ELS IANYONE ELSE.

3033
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
THEY HAVE ASKED FOR HELP FROM A

3034
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER WITHIN THE

3035
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
STATE OR OUTSIDE THE STATE TO

3036
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
ASSIST BECAUSE OF THE SHEER

3037
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
NUMBER OF BODIES.

3038
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:06,000
WHEN YOU HAVE 27, YOU KNOW, 26,

3039
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
27 BODIES, IT TAKES A LONG TIME

3040
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
TO DO THAT.

3041
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
TO DO A THOROUGH JOB.

3042
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:15,000
BUT AS T'S SOMETHING TH-- BUT I

3043
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
THEY HAVE TO DO, NOT A PLEASANT

3044
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
TASK BUT SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO

3045
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
DO.

3046
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:22,000
>> SURE, BUT EVEN AS MANY GUNS

3047
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
AS THERE ARE, YOU GET THE SENSE

3048
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
THAT IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO DO

3049
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, SADLY AND

3050
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
TRAGICALLY THEY'RE GOING TO.

3051
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
WOLF?
>> YEAH.
IF THEY'RE DETERMINED TO START

3052
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
KILLING LITTLE CHILDREN IN AN

3053
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, HOW DO YOU

3054
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,000
PREVENT THAT?
AND THAT'S A QUESTION THAT'S

3055
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:42,000
GOING TO BE ASKED.

3056
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
MIKE, WE'LL CONTINUE THIS

3057
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
CONVERSATION, STAND BY FOR THAT.

3058
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
MEANWHILE A COUNTRY AND

3059
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
PRESIDENT GRIEVING FOR VICTIMS

3060
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
OF THIS HORRIFIC, HORRIFIC

3061
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
TRAGEDY.

3062
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:54,000
WE'LL CONTINUE OUR SPECIAL
COVERAGE RIGHT AFTER THIS.

3063
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
>>> SHOCK AND SADNESS ACROSS THE

3064
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,000
NATION, INDEED SO MUCH OF THE

3065
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
WORLD FOLLOWING A MASS SHOOTING

3066
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HERE IN

3067
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, A FEW

3068
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
HOURS AFTER THE RAMPAGE.

3069
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA DELIVERED A

3070
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
STATEMENT, A POWERFUL STATEMENT

3071
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
ON THIS HORRIFIC TRAGEDY.

3072
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,000
HE GOT VERY EMOTIONAL, SOMETIMES

3073
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
-- TYPICALLY DOESN'T GET THAT

3074
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
EMOTIONAL AT LEAST IN PUBLIC,

3075
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,000
BUT HE ACTUALLY STARTED TO TEAR

3076
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
UP AS HE SPOKE ABOUT THESE YOUNG

3077
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
VICTIMS.

3078
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
WANT TO PLAY IN ITS ENTIRETY THE

3079
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,000
STATEMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT
MADE.

3080
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
>> THIS AFTERNOON I SPOKE WITH

3081
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:32,000
GOVERNOR MALLOY AND FBI DIRECTOR

3082
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
MUELLER.
I OFFERED GOVERNOR MALLOY MY

3083
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
CONDOLENCES ON BEHALF OF THE

3084
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,000
NATION AND MADE IT CLEAR HE WILL

3085
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:40,000
HAVE

3086
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
CONDOLENCES AND WILL GIVE HIM

3087
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
EVERY RESOURCE HE NEEDS TO

3088
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:48,000
INVESTIGATE THIS CRIME, CARE FOR

3089
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
THE VICTIMS, COUNSEL THEIR
FAMILIES.

3090
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
WE'VE ENDURED TOO MANY OF THESE

3091
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST FEW YEARS

3092
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:58,000
AND EACH TIME I LEARN THE NEWS I

3093
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
REACT NOT AS A PRESIDENT BUT AS

3094
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:06,000
ANYBODY ELSE WOULD, AS A PARENT.

3095
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,000
AND THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE

3096
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
TODAY.
I KNOW THERE IS NOT A PARENT IN

3097
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
AMERICA WHO DOES NOT FEEL THE

3098
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I DO.

3099
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:20,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

3100
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

3101
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

3102
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:27,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

3103
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

3104
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:43,000
AHEAD OF THEM, BIRTHDAYS,

3105
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,000
GRADUATIONS, WEDDINGS, KIDS OF

3106
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,000
THEIR OWN.

3107
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

3108
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
TEACHERS, MEN AND WOMEN WHO

3109
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING

3110
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
OUR CHILDREN FULFILL THEIR

3111
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
DREAMS.

3112
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
SO OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY.

3113
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
FOR THE PARENT AND GRANDPARENTS,

3114
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
SISTERS AND BROTHERS OF THESE

3115
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
LITTLE CHILDREN AND FOR THE

3116
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:15,000
FAMILIES OF THE ADULTS WHO WERE

3117
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
LOST.
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

3118
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
PARENT OF THE SURVIVORS AS WELL.

3119
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
FOR AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE TO

3120
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

3121
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
TONIGHT, THEY KNOW THAT THEIR

3122
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN

3123
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:30,000
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY

3124
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,000
AND THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT WILL

3125
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
EASE THEIR PAIN.

3126
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
AS A COUNTRY, WE HAVE BEEN

3127
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
THROUGH THIS TOO MANY TIMES,

3128
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,000
WHETHER IT'S AN ELEMENTARY

3129
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,000
SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN OR A SHOPPING

3130
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,000
MALL IN OREGON OR A TEMPLE IN

3131
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
WISCONSIN OR A MOVIE THEATER IN

3132
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:50,000
AURORA OR A STREET CORNER IN

3133
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
CHICAGO, THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE

3134
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND THESE

3135
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
CHILDREN ARE OUR CHILDREN.

3136
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME

3137
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:01,000
TOGETHER AND TAKE MEANINGFUL

3138
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
ACTION TO PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES

3139
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
LIKE THIS REGARDLESS OF THE

3140
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
POLITICS.
THIS EVENING, MICHELLE AND I

3141
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
WILL DO WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT

3142
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:14,000
IN AMERICA WILL DO, WHICH IS HUG

3143
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:19,000
OUR CHILDREN TIGHTER AND REMIND

3144
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
EACH OTHER HOW DEEPLY WE LOVE

3145
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:26,000
ONE ANOTHER BUT THERE ARE FA

3146
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
FAMILIES IN CONNECTICUT WHO

3147
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
CANNOT DO THAT AND THEY NEED US

3148
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,000
RIGHT NOW TO COME TOGETHER AS

3149
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
AMERICANS AND I WILL DO

3150
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER AS

3151
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
PRESIDENT TO HELP BECAUSE WHILE

3152
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,000
NOTHING CAN FILL THE SPACE OF

3153
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:44,000
THE LOT OF CHILD S LOST CHILD O

3154
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,000
ALL OF US CAN REMIND THEM THAT

3155
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
WE ARE THERE FOR THEM, THAT WE

3156
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
ARE PRAYING FOR THEM, THAT THE

3157
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
LOVE THEY FELT FOR THOSE THEY

3158
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
LOST ENDURES NOT JUST IN THEIR

3159
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:03,000
MEMORIES BUT ALSO IN OURS.

3160
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORIES OF

3161
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,000
THE VICTIMS AND IN THE WORDS OF

3162
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
SCRIPTURE, HEAL THE

3163
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:16,000
BROKENHEARTED AND BIND UP THEIR

3164
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
WOUNDS.
>> NOT OFTEN YOU SEE A PRESIDENT

3165
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
OF THE UNITED STATES WIPING AWAY

3166
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
TEARS, HOLDING BACK THOSE TEARS,

3167
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
SPEAKING SO EMOTIONALLY, SO

3168
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
PERSONALLY, NOT ONLY AS THE

3169
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
PRESIDENT BUT ALSO AS A FATHER.

3170
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,000
IN THAT INITIAL STATEMENT HE

3171
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:37,000
DIDN'T DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE VERY

3172
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,000
SENSITIVE ISSUE OF GUN CONTROL

3173
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
IN THE UNITED STATES.

3174
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
BUT THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS
SECRETARY JAY CARNEY DID TELL

3175
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
REPORTERS THE PRESIDENT SUPPORTS

3176
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
REINSTATING A FEDERAL BAN ON THE

3177
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,000
ASSAULT ON ASSAULT WEAPONS.

3178
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
THAT WAS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

3179
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
PRESS SECRETARY, JAY CARNEY.

3180
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,000
THE HARROWING WORDS FROM THE

3181
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
STUDENTS WHO WITNESSED SOMETHING

3182
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,000
THAT NO CHILD SHOULD EVER HAVE

3183
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,000
TO SEE ARE SUCH A POWERFUL

3184
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,000
REMINDER OF THE ENORMITY OF THIS

3185
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
TRAGEDY.
TO GIVE US A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT

3186
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:10,000
HAPPENED, CNN JOSH LEVS IS GOING

3187
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
TO GIVE US A 3-D LOOK AT THE

3188
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
SCHOOL.

3189
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
>> I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU THROUGH

3190
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
SOME NEW INFORMATION THAT WE GOT

3191
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,000
THIS MORNING.
THIS IS A 3-D IMAGE OF THE

3192
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
SCHOOL.

3193
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
WE LEARNED THIS MORNING THAT

3194
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
POLICE ARE SAYING THAT THE

3195
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
ENTIRE THING IS AND REMAINS A

3196
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
CRIME SCENE.

3197
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
THEY SAY THEY ARE SEARCHING EACH

3198
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
AND EVERY ROOM AND IN THE WORDS

3199
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
OF THE POLICE, EACH HE EVERY

3200
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,000
WEEK IN THE PARKING LOT.

3201
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
WE DO NOT KNOW IF THERE ARE

3202
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
SPECIFIC THINGS THEY ARE LOOKING

3203
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:38,000
FOR BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THEY ARE

3204
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,000
SEARCHING ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING,

3205
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
SCOURING THE AREA.

3206
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
POLICE PUT OUT A STATEMENT THIS

3207
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
MORNING SAYING THAT THE FIRST

3208
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
911 CALL ABOUT THIS CAME IN AT

3209
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
ABOUT 9:30 A.M.

3210
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:51,000
I WANT OUR VIEWERS IN THIS

3211
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD TO

3212
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:58,000
UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY SECONDS

3213
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,000
COUNT, EVEN FRACTIONS OF A

3214
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
MINUTE.
IF THE CALL CAME IN AROUND 9:30

3215
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
A.M., THAT PUTS THE TIME FRAME

3216
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
BACK FROM TEN MINUTES FROM WHAT

3217
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
WE BELIEVED LAST NIGHT AND THAT

3218
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
CAN INTRODUCE NEW QUESTIONS.

3219
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
WHEN SCHOOL WAS BEGINNING, WAS

3220
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
THE GUNMAN ALREADY THERE?

3221
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:14,000
WAS HE HIDING IN PLACES?

3222
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
WAS THERE SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE

3223
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
COULD HAVE SEEN MIGHT HAVE

3224
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
ULTIMATELY MADE A DIFFERENCE?

3225
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
LET ME TALK YOU THROUGH A LITTLE

3226
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN

3227
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
HEARING ABOUT THIS ACTUAL

3228
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,000
ATTACK.
WE DO KNOW NOW THAT THIS GUNMAN

3229
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
FORCED HIS WAY INTO THE

3230
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
BUILDING.
THERE'S A SECURITY SYSTEM AT

3231
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
THIS BUILDING.
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW HE DID

3232
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,000
BUT ONE OF THE CHIEF QUESTIONS

3233
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
THAT SCHOOL AROUND THE COUNTRY,

3234
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
PEOPLE WILL BE ASKING, HOW DOES

3235
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,000
SOMEONE FORCE THEMSELVES INTO

3236
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:43,000
THE SCHOOL WITH A WEAPON?

3237
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,000
WE HEARD SOMETHING THAT CAN TURN

3238
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
OUT TO BE VERY SIGNIFICANT.
IT'S BELIEVED THAT THIS AREA

3239
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
RIGHT HERE IS WHERE THE

3240
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
SHOOTINGS TOOK PLACE AND THAT

3241
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
THE WEAPONS WERE FOUND RIGHT

3242
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
NEAR HIM.
BUT WE HAVE TO FIND OUT EXACTLY

3243
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:57,000
WHAT HAPPENED STEP BY STEP

3244
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
INSIDE THIS SCHOOL AND WHAT

3245
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
POTENTIAL EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT
OTHERWISE -- OR ULTIMATELY END

3246
