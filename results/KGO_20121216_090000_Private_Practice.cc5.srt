1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
TONIGHT?
ABOUT SAM AND NAOMI.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
THERE'S NOTHING TO DO.
ARE--ARE YOU WITH PETE?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
CONFERENCE CALL.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
REMEMBER THE GOOD OLD DAYS--
SAM AND NAOMI TOGETHER,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
THE PRACTICE
RUNNING IN HARMONY?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
YOU--YOU DIDN'T
WORK HERE THEN.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
THE POINT IS WE MUST RETURN
TO THE WAY IT WAS.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
DAYS OF YESTERYEAR? BAD IDEA.
NO, NO, ACTUALLY,
IT'S A--IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hold on.
I'm gonna get Coop.
NO, DON'T GET COOP.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
(telephone rings)

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
HOW COME I DIDN'T KNOW

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
ANY NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRLS
IN HIGH SCHOOL?
I DID.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
PETE, ARE YOU AT VIOLET'S?
NO. TECHNOLOGY.
CONFERENCE CALL.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
WE'RE DOING
AN INTERVENTION.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
ENDING THE WAR--SAM AND NAOMI,
PEACE AT THE OFFICE.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
OH, I'M IN.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
VOLVED,
PEOPLE.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
WE ARE GONNA PUT THEM
IN A ROOM

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
AND CREATE A SUPPORTIVE,
NONTHREATENING ENVIRONMENT.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I NEED SOMEONE
TO LICK MY LOLLIPOP.
I GOTTA GO.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
D-DON'T HANG UP.
(doorbell ringing)

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
ARE--ARE WE AGREED?
YEP, TOMORROW,
FIRST THING--

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
OPERATION "GET NAOMI AND SAM
BACK TOGETHER."

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I GOTTA GO.
UH, KEVIN'S HERE.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
IF YOU HANG UP,
DOES THAT MEAN--
(dial tone drones)

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
HEY.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
CHINESE TAKEOUT,
BOTTLE OF WINE,

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
FANCY SUBTITLED MOVIE,
HOT ACTION MOVIE--

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
WHICHEVER YOU NEED
TO BE HAPPY.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I NEED.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
♪

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT RULES?

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
YOU THINK WE SHOULD SET RULES
FOR NAOMI AND SAM?

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
NO, NO.
RULES ABOUT DATING.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
SEX RULES?
MM-HMM, YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
IS THIS YOU
TRYING TO BOND WITH ME?
NO, I'M SEEKING
YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'M THINKING ABOUT SETTING
SOME RULES FOR MYSELF.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
IS THIS ABOUT
THE S.W.A.T. GUY?
MM-HMM.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
YOU TWO HAVEN'T...
NOPE.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
WOW. YOU'RE ONE OF
THOSE WOMEN.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE WOMEN.

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'M CAUTIOUS.
I'M TRYING TO BE CAUTIOUS.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
SO YOU DON'T LIKE HIM?

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I DO LIKE HIM. I JUST...
ONCE YOU SLEEP WITH SOMEONE--

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I DON'T KNOW, IN THE PAST,
I-I MESSED UP.

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I JUST DON'T WANT TO
DO THAT AGAIN, SO I THOUGHT

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
IF I MADE SOME RULES--
BUT YOU WANT
TO SLEEP WITH HIM?

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
YES, BUT MY RULES, I--
WHAT RULES?

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
YOU NEED TO SEE
A THERAPIST.

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
THERAPISTS ARE OVERRATED.
UH...

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
OKAY, JUST SAW 'EM IN THE LOBBY.
THEY'RE ON THE WAY UP.
TOGETHER? THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE
NOT TALKING AT ALL.
WELL, THAT'S A BAD SIGN.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
HEY, YOU'RE BACK.
I AM, I AM, FULL-TIME
AS OF TODAY. OKAY, OKAY.

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
SEE? BACK TO THE WAY
IT WAS.
(elevator bell dings)

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
ALL RIGHT, BE STRONG,
BE FIRM

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
AND DON'T TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER.

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I THOUGHT WE SAID
NO MORE SECRET MEETINGS.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
IT'S NOT SECRET.
WHOSE CUPCAKES?

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
WHAT IS THIS?
IT'S AN INTERVENTION.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
SOMEBODY HAVE A PROBLEM
THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF?

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
OH, NO, NO, NO. IT'S FOR YOU,
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
TO GET YOU TWO BACK...

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
TO THE WAY IT USED TO BE--

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
OUR LEADERS, TOGETHER.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
NO.
NO, THAT'S--
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
SORRY.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
OKAY, I WAS BEING POLITE.

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
WE CANCELED
YOUR MORNING PATIENTS.

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
YOU TWO ARE GONNA SIT
IN THIS ROOM,

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
YOU'RE GONNA EAT THE CUPCAKES,
AND YOU'RE GONNA REMEMBER

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
WHY IT IS THAT YOU STARTED
THIS PRACTICE

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
IN THE FIRST PLACE TOGETHER.

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
AND THEN YOU ARE GOING TO AGREE
ON A WAY TO MOVE FORWARD,

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
WITH THIS PRACTICE,
TOGETHER AS A FAMILY.

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
DON'T COME OUT
UNTIL YOU'RE DONE.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
(woman) BRADEN DOESN'T SPEAK,
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHEN I DO.

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
WE'VE BEEN TO FIVE DOCTORS.

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
MY FRIEND BETH SAID YOU WERE
AMAZING WITH HER DAUGHTER.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
CHECK THIS OUT.
LOOK AT THAT.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
IT'S GOT A LADDER.
IT'S GOT A LITTLE GUY IN THERE.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
HMM?

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
PLEASE DON'T JUST TELL ME
HE'S AUTISTIC.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
BRADEN MIGHT BE PROCESSING
MORE THAN YOU THINK,

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
AND IF HE IS--
AUGMENTATIVE
COMMUNICATION THERAPY,

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
SENSORY INTEGRATION PROGRAMS--
THEY HAVEN'T WORKED FOR HIM.

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
SO HE STARTED SPEAKING
AND... HE JUST STOPPED AT 4?

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
SO NOW YE ENVIRONMENTAL,

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
IT COULD BE GENETIC,
IT COULD BE ANYTHING.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
SOMETIMES KIDS
JUST BECOME AUTISTIC.

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S ONE OF
THOSE DISORDERS

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THAT JUST ISN'T
THAT WELL UNDERSTOOD.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
DO WE KNOW EACH OTHER
FROM SOMEWHERE?
DO WE?

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I JUST WANT TO KNOW YOU.

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
SO YOU'LL DO SOMETHING
FOR BRADEN.

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'LL TAKE A LOOK,
I'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND,

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
AND I WILL DO WHAT I CAN.
I PROMISE.
OKAY.

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
HEY, BRADEN.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
CAN YOU FOLLOW
THE LIGHT FOR ME?

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
CAN YOU LOOK UP?

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
WHOA.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
HERE. THERE YOU GO.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
IT'S WORKING, NAYSAYER.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
WHAT DOES THAT
EVEN MEAN?

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
YOU THINK WE'RE BACK?

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I THINK WE MIGHT BE BACK.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
HEY, WELL, WE AGREE.

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
YOU SEE?
WE'RE ALL GONNA VOTE...

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
MY WAY OR NAOMI'S.

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
WHAT? NO.
YOU CHOOSE WHICH ONE OF US
RUNS THE PRACTICE.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
AND WE'LL ABIDE BY
THE DECISION.

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
THIS IS A BAD IDEA.
THIS IS GONNA TEAR US APART.
I WARNED YOU.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
LOOK, YOU WE

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
WE CAN'T KEEP ON THE WAY
THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
SO WE WILL CAMPAIGN FAIRLY.
RIGHT, NO DIRTY TRICKS,
NO BRIBERY.

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
CIVIL, DEMOCRATIC--THE WAY
THE PRACTICE SHOULD BE RUN.

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT
I WANT ANYTHING ELSE?

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
DO I GET A VOTE? I MEAN,
I AM PART OF THE PRACTICE.

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
THAT WAS THE DEAL, RIGHT?
YEAH, OF COURSE YOU ARE.

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
RIGHT. I-I WOULDN'T HAVE IT
ANY OTHER WAY.

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
SO, UH, TOMORROW
AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS.

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
RIGHT.
WE VOTE... TOMORROW.

125
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
ALL RIGHT?

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
(chuckles)

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
SO SEEING AS YOU'RE
GONNA NEED VOTES,

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I WANT TO START SHADOWING.

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I DON'T HAVE YOUR VOTE?

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
AFTER I BULLIED SAM
INTO TAKING YOU BACK?

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
YOU WERE THE REASON
THAT I LEFT.

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
YOU'RE DOING A GAMETE
MICROMANIPULATION ON FRIDAY.

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I WANT TO ASSIST.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
OH, UH, THE COLES.

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
UM, THAT'S--THAT'S DIFFICULT.
IT IS WHAT YOU PROMISED.

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I NEED TO GET THE HOURS FOR
MY MIDWIFE CERTIFICATION.
I KNOW.

137
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
IT'S JUST THAT THE COLES, UH,
CAN BE A LITTLE BIT JUMPY.

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
INK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
YOU THINK ABOUT IT.
VOTE'S TOMORROW.

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
SHARB--
SHARBAT QALZAI?

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I AM SHARBAT'S FATHER,
IDREES QALZAI.

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
HELLO. HOW DO YOU DO?
I'M DR. MONTGOMERY.

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
SHARBAT IDENTIFIED YOU

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
AS THE TOP DOCTOR
THERE IS FOR LADIES.

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU
TO GIVE HER THE EXAM

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
YOU GIVE
YOUR VERY BEST PATIENTS.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
ALL OF MY PATIENTS
GET THE VERY BEST,

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
AND SHARBAT WILL BE
NO EXCEPTION.

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
SO WHY DON'T, UH,
WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK?

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
(whispers)
STAY RIGHT HERE.

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
OH, HEY. I'M NOT GONNA--

152
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'M NOT GONNA KNOW ANYTHING
TILL I GET HIS LABS BACK.

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I RELE?

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
OW YOU FROM.
NICOLE?

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
YOU'RE THE ONE IN THE PICTURES,
NAKED, ON THAT WEB SITE.
WHAT?

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
THE DATING SITE
FOR ADULTS.

157
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
YOU SAW THAT?

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
YOU ARE A DOCTOR,
A PEDIATRICIAN--

159
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
PLEASE, NICOLE--
HOW CAN YOU WORK
WITH CHILDREN?

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
OKAY, THAT SITE
HAS NOTHING TO...

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
MY PERSONAL LIFE DOES NOT IMPACT
THE CARE I GIVE MY PATIENTS.

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
HOW CAN IT NOT?

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
YOU SHOULD NOT BE A DOCTOR.

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
SO YOU'VE BEEN HAVING
SOME DISCOMFORT?

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
SORT OF.

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
WHERE EXACTLY ARE YOU

00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
STOP WORRYING.
IT'S A BITE.

499
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
(chuckles)

500
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
IT'S AN INSECT BITE,
RIGHT?

501
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
WOW. WHAT BIT YOU
AND DID THAT?

502
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I DON'T KNOW.
PROBABLY A SAND FLY.

503
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'VE BEEN LIVING
IN NIGERIA.

504
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
(water running)

505
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
SO HOW DO YOU KNOW PETE?

506
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
WE WERE RESIDENTS TOGETHER.

507
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
THEN WE DID
DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS

508
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS
BEFORE HE MOVED HERE.

509
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
WHOA, WHOA. PETE DID
DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS?
WHEN WAS THAT?

510
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
15 YEARS AGO. HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO TAKE A COUPLE MONTHS OFF,

511
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
BUT THEN HE MET SOMEBODY,
MARRIED HER,

512
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
SETTLED... DOWN HERE.

513
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
HE NEVER TOLD YOU ABOUT IT?
NO, BUT YOU CAN TELL US.

514
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
PETE'S A VERY PRIVATE PERSON.
HE'S VERY SHY. HE'S VERY SHY.
HE DOESN'T LIKE TO BRAG.

515
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
UH, TRUST ME.
HE'S NOT SHY.

516
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
WELL, I-I DIDN'T MEAN SHY
IN THE--THE "SHY" SENSE.

517
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
SO WHAT WAS HE LIKE THEN?

518
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
AMAZING.

519
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
AMAZING DOCTOR.

520
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
WELL, YOU KNOW.

521
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
WE'VE ONLY SEEN PETE
DO EASTERN MEDICINE.

522
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
WE'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
IN ACTION.

523
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
OH.

524
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
ONE TIME WE WERE, UH, TREATING
THESE CHILDREN IN BOSNIA.

525
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
THE ORPHANAGE
WAS UNDER MORTAR FIRE.

526
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
AN EVACUATION WAS ORDERED,

527
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
TO GET THE KIDS OUT.

528
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
PETER REFUSED TO LEAVE
THE KIDS BEHIND.

529
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
HE STAYED WITH 'EM
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

530
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
MOST OF THE KIDS SURVIVED
BECAUSE OF HIM.

531
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
PETE DID THAT?
OUR PETE?

532
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY...
"PETE."

533
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
TO ME HE WAS ALWAYS "PETER."

534
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
PETER.

535
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
HEY, YOU GOT A MINUTE?

536
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
TO SNOOP ABOUT MEG,
OR HOCK ME FOR A VOTE?

537
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE VOTE.
THIS IS ABOUT THE PRACTICE...

538
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
OKAY.
AND THE DIRECTION
THAT IT IS HEADED IN.

539
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
NAI--
AND I THINK THAT I CAN SUM UP
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW

540
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN SAM AND ME

541
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
AND THE WAY WE SEE THIS PRACTICE
INTO ONE WORD--DEFATALATOR.

542
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
DEFATALATOR?
IT WAS AN EXPERIMENT,

543
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
A LEAD-IN
TO A TOTAL WELLNESS PROGRAM.

544
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
IT'S A SHAME YOU DIDN'T
HAVE IT IN WEST AFRICA.
HE DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

545
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
ANOTHER DOCTOR IN THE PRACTICE

546
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
WAS PRESSING HIM INTO TRYING
TO BRING IN BUSINESS--

547
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
SOMETHING I WOULD NEVER DO.

548
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
HI, I'M NAOMI BENNETT.
SHE'S CAMPAIGNING.

549
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
AND YOU'RE
THE ANTI-DEFATALATOR CANDIDATE?

550
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED
THAN THAT.
IS IT?

551
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
(knock on door)

552
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
HEY.

553
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
TO WHAT DO I OWE
THIS SURPRISE?

554
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I'VE GOT
THIS COMING WEEKEND OFF,

555
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
AND I WAS THINKING YOU, ME,
CABO SAN LUCAS.

556
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
A WEEKEND AWAY--
PALMILLA, VERY FANCY,

557
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
PERFECT, CLEAR BLUE WATERS.

558
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
WE COULD GET AWAY.

559
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
MM.

560
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
(chuckles)

561
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
TOO MUCH?
NO. YES.

562
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
NO. YE--

563
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
YES. (chuckles) NO. HERE--
HERE'S THE THING--

564
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
UM, WE'VE BEEN OUT
A FEW TIMES,

565
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
AND, UM, IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S BEEN GREAT.

566
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I... I REALLY LIKE YOU--

567
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
IS THIS WHERE YOU
BREAK UP WITH ME?

568
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
NO, NO.

569
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
IT'S JUST, UM...
I HAVE THESE RULES.

570
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
THEY'RE STUPID RULES,
REALLY.

571
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
BUT, UM, IN THE PAST,
WHEN I DIDN'T HAVE RULES,

572
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
IT--IT--
IT DIDN'T GO SO WELL.

573
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
MY--MY--MY POINT IS THAT

574
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
NOW THAT I HAVE MY RULES...

575
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
MM-HMM.

576
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I DON'T WANT TO BREAK THEM.
YOU KNOW?

577
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
YEAH, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

578
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
(laughs)
I WANT TO KNOW,
BUT, UM, RULES?

579
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
SEX RULES.

580
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
RULES ABOUT SEX.

581
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
YOU KNOW, A HOTEL MEANS
A ROOM, A ROOM MEANS A BED,

582
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
A BED MEANS--
YOU HAVE SEX RULES.

583
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'M WAITING.
UNTIL MARRIAGE?

584
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
NO! NO. (laughs)
(laughs)

585
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
NO, NO. I--

586
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
JUST TILL, UM...

587
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
UNTIL IT FEELS RIGHT,
UNTIL I'M... SURE.

588
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
OKAY.

589
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
SO WE'LL WAIT.

590
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I'M GOOD WITH WAITING.

591
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'M HAPPY WITH WAITING.
REALLY?

592
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
NO, BUT I CAN WAIT.
(laughs)

593
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
AND I AM SURE.

594
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
GO AWAY.
THIS WILL JUST TAKE
ONE SECOND.

595
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
NALIZATIONS.
O HEAR
YOUR RATIONALIZATIONS.

596
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
(knocks on door)

597
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
BRADEN MIGHT NOT BE AUTISTIC.

598
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
IS THIS SOME SICK IDEA--
NO.

599
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
HE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING CALLED
LANDAU-KLEFFNER SYNDROME.

600
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
IN KIDS LIKE BRADEN, THAT LOSE
THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE,

601
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
THEY MIGHT BE HAVING SEIZURES.
AT NIGHT. YOU DON'T NOTICE THEM,

602
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
BUT IT CAUSES PROBLEMS WITH
THE SYNAPSES IN THEIR BRAIN.

603
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
THEY START MISFIRING. IT IMPAIRS
THEIR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE,

604
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
AND WHEN THEY CAN'T COMMUNICATE,
THEY WITHDRAW.

605
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
AND THE THING IS,
WITH CORTICOSTEROIDS,

606
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
WITH ANTICONVULSANTS,
IT MIGHT BE TREATABLE.

607

THREE EXCELLENT PEDIATRICIANS.

PETE NOT TELLING US
ABOUT HIS PAST IS NOT A LIE.

ADDISON?

715
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
WELL, HER PATIENT LIED
ABOUT BEING RAPED.

716
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
OH.
BUT I GUESS I CAN'T
HOLD THAT AGAINST HER.

717
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
YOU KNOW WHAT, ADDISON?

718
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN HELP HIM?

720
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
IF WE GIVE BRADEN

IN A MATTER OF HOURS.

723
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
BEFORE HE GOES TO BED,
WE COULD KNOW IF IT'LL HELP.

724
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
DID YOU REALLY
WORK IN AFRICA

725
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000

WITH RIVER BLINDNESS?

726
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
HAVE YOU HEARD THE STORY ABOUT
HIM AND THE BOSNIAN ORPHANS?
NO!

727
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
WHERE DID YOU
HEAR ABOUT THAT?
IN THE LADIES ROOM.

728
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE
DO IN THERE?

729
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
YOU HAD THIS WHOLE PAST, PETE?
PETER.

730
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
PETER?

731
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

732
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
YOU REALLY LIKE HER.

733
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
LOOK...

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I KNOW YOU WANT THIS.
YOU THINK YOU WANT THIS.

736
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.
IT MAY BE THE ONLY WAY

737
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
FOR THIS MAN YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO MARRY, BUT FOR YOU--

738
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU.

739
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
LOOK, YOU TOLD YOUR MOTHER
ABOUT THE RAPE.

740
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
TELL HER ABOUT THIS BOY
YOU LOVE.

741
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
DO YOU REALLY WANT
YOUR FUTURE

742
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
TO BE BASED ON A LIE?

743
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
HAVE YOU BEEN HAVING FATIGUE,
HEADACHE, JOINT PAINS?

744
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'VE BEEN ON AND OFF AIRPLANES
ALL MONTH

745
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
IN HALF A DOZEN
DIFFERENT TIME ZONES.

746
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Y-YES, I HAVE.

747
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
OH, COME ON, SAM.
WHAT IS IT?

748
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
THERE WE GO.

749
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
THIS.

750
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
THAT WAS IN MY BACK?

751
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
OF A TICK.

752
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
THE REMNANTS
OF A TICK.

753
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
PROBABLY BEEN IN THERE
A WEEK OR SO.

754
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
PETE WAS RIGHT.

755
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
THESE THINGS CAN CAUSE
A NASTY INFECTION.

756
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
IF YOU WOULD'VE LET IT
LAST ANY LONGER,

757
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
YOU COULD HAVE WOUND UP
WITH SERIOUS CARDIAC PROBLEMS,

758
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
ENCEPHALITIS--

759
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
WELL, THANK YOU.

760
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
WELL, YOU CAN THANK PETER.

761
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I DON'T SUPPOSE I COULD
PAY YOU OFF

762
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
TO SAY IT WAS
A SAND FLY BITE?

763
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
(laughs)

764
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
OH. (exhales slowly)

765
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
YOU DECIDE WHAT TO DO?

766
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I DECIDED THE TRUTH
SEEMED BETTER.

767
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
HEY, SPEAKING OF WHICH, UH,

768
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
WHY IS IT THAT NO ONE SEEMS
TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU?

769
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
YOU KNOW ME.
APPARENTLY WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW YOUR NAME... PETER.

770
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
LOOK, THE PAST IS THE PAST.
I'M NOT ONE TO DWELL ON IT.

771
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
BUT MEG--SHE SEEMS LIKE
A GOOD PART OF YOUR PAST.

772
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
SHE'S HERE NOW.
THEN SHE'LL BE GONE.

773
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
SO... IT IS WHAT IT IS.

774
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
YOU COULD NOT LET HER GO.

775
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS?

776
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
YOU ARE A ROMANTIC.

777
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
YOU DON'T WANT THEM
RUNNING THIS PLACE TOGETHER.

778
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
YOU WANT THEM TOGETHER--
SAM AND NAOMI THE WAY IT WAS,

779
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
YOU AND NAOMI
THE WAY IT WAS.

780
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
I LIKE THE WAY IT WAS.

781
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
(door opens)

782
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
THANK YOU.

783
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
WHAT SHARBAT
IS ASKING FOR,

784
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
WHAT SHE WANTS TO GIVE UP
IS A LOT.

785
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
AND I THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW THE TRUTH.

786
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I KNEW.
MOTHERS ARE MOTHERS.

787
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
WHAT SHE COULDN'T TELL ME,
I KNEW.
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

788
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
YOU LET HER SAY
SHE WAS RAPED?
IF SHE BROKE THE TRUST

789
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
THAT HER FATHER AND I HAVE
IN HER, IT WOULD BE HER SIN.

790
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
SHE WOULD HAVE FELT SHAME.

791
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
IT WAS EASIER FOR HER TO SAY
IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE'S.

792
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
WE'VE TALKED.

793
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
NOW WILL YOU DO
THE SURGERY?

794
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
UH...

795
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
SHARBAT,
NO MATTER WHAT I DO,

796
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I CAN'T MAKE YOU FORGET
WHAT YOU HAD HERE.

797
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I LOVE MY PARENTS MORE
THAN ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD.

798
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I JUST WANT
TO TAKE THEM HOME.

799
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
PLEASE, IF I DON'T BURY
MY PAST,

800
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
MY FAMILY WILL HAVE
NO FUTURE.

801
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
NO, NO, NO,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--
STOP, STOP TALKING.

802
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
JUST LISTEN--LISTEN TO
WHAT I'M SAYING.
WAIT, NO, NO, NO.
I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT.

803
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
YOU GOT ME OUT OF THE MARRIAGE.
NOW WHAT YOU CAN DO

804
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
IS OVER THE PRACTICE.GO AHEAD
AND TAKE OVER THE PRACTICE.
FOR THE LAST TIME--
PROBABLY NOT THE LAST TIME...

805
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
MAYBE I'LL GO WORK
OVER AT ST. AMBROSE.
BECAUSE WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE THIS
ARGUMENT MAYBE NINE MORE TIMES

806
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY...
NO, REALLY, I'M SURE THAT I
COULD FIND A JOB THERE...

807
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
SINCE WE'VE ALREADY HAAVE A PRIG
TO HAVE A PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

808
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I DON'T CARE.

809
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
GREAT.

810
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
LOOK, MAYBE THIS IS MY FAULT.

811
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I PUSHED US TO TRY
TO RECAPTURE THE PAST,

812
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
WHAT WE HAD,
WHAT THIS PLACE USED TO BE.

813
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
BUT THE PAST IS CLUTTERED
WITH ANGER AND MISTAKES,

814
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
AND WE NEED TO BURY THAT.

815
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO DID WHAT WHEN.

816
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
IT MATTERS
WHAT WE WANT TO DO NOW,

817
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
WHAT WE WANT THIS PLACE
TO BE GOING FORWARD.

818
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON PATIENTS,
AND WE NEED TO EARN MONEY.

819
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
WE NEED NAOMI AND WE NEED SAM,

820
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
THE BEST OF BOTH OF YOU.

821
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
AND THIS VOTE,A,

822
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
AN IDEA THAT WE MIGHT NEVER
RECOVER FROM.

823
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
WE SHOULDN'T DO IT.

824
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
LET'S SIT DOWN AND FIGURE OUT

825
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
WHAT WE WANT
THIS PLACE TO BE, TOGETHER.

826
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
IF YOU FORCE US TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN YOU,

827
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
THAT WILL CREATE SCARS
THAT WON'T HEAL.

828
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
WE NEED TO MOVE
NOT BACK.

829
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
WE VOTE
