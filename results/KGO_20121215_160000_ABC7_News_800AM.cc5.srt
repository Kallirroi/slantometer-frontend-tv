WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THE SCHOOL

193
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
TRAGEDY IN CONNECTICUT IN JUST A

194
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
MOMENT.

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
HA HAVING?

NEXT I SHALL PROCURE
SOME HOBBIT HOLES

198
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
WITH A SIDE OF THE
PUMPKIN PANCAKES.

199
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THAT OUGHT TO HOLD ME
TILL SECOND BREAKFAST.

200
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
EAT LIKE A HOBBIT.

201
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
ONLY AT DENNY'S.

202
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
AND SEE "THE HOBBIT:
AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY."

203
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So I get Claritin Clear...

204
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
...for strong, non-drowsy
relief of all my allergies...

205
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
...like dust...

206
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
...mold...

207
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000

Looks good.
Thanks.

209
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I Live Claritin Clear.

210
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
>>> WHEN WE HEARD GUNSHOTS, IT

211
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ARMY GUNSHOTS

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
AND POLICEMAN GUNSHOTS, WE WERE

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
HIDING IN MY TEACHER'S OFFICE.

214
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
IT WAS SCARY.

215
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
WE HAD TO HIDE THERE BECAUSE WE

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
WERE REALLY NEAR THAT GUY.

217
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
THA THE GUY COULD HAVE COME INTO

218
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
NORMAL, FRIDAY MORNING WOULD BE

221
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000

THE MEDIAN TO FIX A FLAT TIRE.

255
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
IT WAS THEN THIS BLACK

EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE AND FORCE

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000

CLUES.
>> IT LOOKS LIKE SPEED WAS A

268
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
FACTOR.

269
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
>> WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE

270
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000

IT CAUSED A TRAFFIC BACK-UP FOR

279
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
MILES.
INVESTIGATORS SAY NEITHER

280
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
ALCOHOL NOR DRUGS APPEAR TO BE A

281
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
FACTOR BUT STRESS THEY ARE IN

THEN THE RAIN WILL GET MORE

291
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
INTERESTING.

IT SHOWS A SCENE NESTLED IN A

301
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
SHIELD BUT CAME UNDER FIRE FROM

302
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
PEOPLE THAT CALLED IT BLAND AND

303
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
NONDESCRIPT.
I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE LOGO

THE SPACE AGENCY WILL

308
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
INTENTIONALLY CRASH THE PROBE

309
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
INTO A CLIFF.

310
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
THEY LAUNCHED THE GRAIL MISSION

311
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR.

312
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
THEY SAY IT HAS BEEN A HUGE

313
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
SUCCESS.

314
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
BACK HERE ON EARTH, WE NEED TO

315
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT.
A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING.

316
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
>> IT IS STILL COLD OUT THERE.

317
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
32 DEGREES IN SANTA ROSA.

318
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000

HERE.

330
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE

331
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
AND WE'LL SEE MORE DRY

332
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE

333
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
MORNING HOURS ACROSS THE BAY

334
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
IT IS GOING TO BE HARD TO GET

339
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
FROM NOVATO TO SANTA ROSA AND

354
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000

SO BE CAREFUL.

355
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
WITH THE COLD START WE'LL LOOK

IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE
ABNORMAL BLEEDING.

XARELTO® CAN CAUSE BLEEDING,
WHICH CAN BE SERIOUS,

AND RARELY MAY LEAD TO DEATH.

MORE EASILY ON XARELTO®,
