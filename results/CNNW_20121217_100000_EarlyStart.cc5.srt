548
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
IF YOU TAKE XARELTO®
WITH ASPIRIN PRODUCTS,

550

IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE
ABNORMAL BLEEDING.

552
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
XARELTO® CAN CAUSE BLEEDING,
WHICH CAN BE SERIOUS,

553
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
AND RARELY MAY LEAD TO DEATH.

554
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
YOU ARE LIKELY TO BRUISE
MORE EASILY ON XARELTO®,

555
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
AND IT MAY TAKE LONGER
FOR BLEEDING TO STOP.

556

TELL YOUR DOCTORS
YOU ARE TAKING XARELTO®

557
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
BEFORE ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
OR DENTAL PROCEDURES.

558
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
BEFORE STARTING XARELTO®,
TELL YOUR DOCTOR

559
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
ABOUT ANY CONDITIONS,
SUCH AS KIDNEY, LIVER

560
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
THE SUSPECT'S VEHICLE, THAT WAS

THAT WERE NOT USED.

856
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
AS FOR THE MOTIVE, INVESTIGATORS

857
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000

866
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE

GUNMAN'S ACTIVETICTIVITIES LEAD

868
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000

WANT TO KNOW.
THE DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS

870
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
LEADING UP TO THE SHOOTING.

871
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
THEY ALREADY HAVE PROOF IN A THE

872
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
GUNMAN WAS AT LEAST ONE GUN

873
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
RANGE.

874
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
THEY'RE NOT TELLING US WITH WHEN

875
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000

876
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
THEY SAY HIS MOTHER WAS ALSO AT

877
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
MULTIPLE GUN RANGES.

878
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
THEY'RE NOT GIVING A TIMELINE

879
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
FOR THAT, EITHER.

880
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
FEDERAL AGENTS CONTINUE CHASING

881
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
LEADS, THOUGH.

882
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000

892
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
TO TRACE THAT GUN.

893
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
THEY'LL KNOW WHERE IT WAS SOLD,

894
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
HOW MUCH IT TRAVELED.

895
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
>> THEY HAVE A LOT MORE TO

896
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
FIGURE OUT.

897
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
>>> IT'S BEEN TRUE THAT GUN

898
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
CONTROL HAS NOT BEEN ON THE

899
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000

NOW.

901
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
NOW, THE DEBATE IS RAGING AGAIN.

902
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
FOR STRICTER GUN LAWS.

903
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
THERE'S SO MANY WEAPONS IN THIS

904
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000

00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING ENOUGH IS

906
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
ENOUGH.

907
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
OF COURSE, OPPONENTS OF GUN

908
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
CONTROL SAY, IF PEOPLE IN THE

909
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
SCHOOL HAD HAD GUNS, THEY WOULD

910
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEFEND

911
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
THEMSELVES.

AND WHERE DO THEY GO BACK TO

1471
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
SCHOOL?

1472

AS WE CAN IS ON THE VICTIMS, BUT

1494
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
THIS IS A CRIME SCENE AND

1495
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
INVESTIGATORS IN THE PAIN

1496
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
STAYING PROCESS OF PIECING

TOGETHER WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

1498
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
IT'S AN AROUND THE CLOCK

1499
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
INVESTIGATION BY CONNECTICUT

1500
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
STATE POLICE, AND AS THEY GATHER

1501
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
EVIDENCE, POLICE HAVE POSITIVELY

1502
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
IDENTIFIED ADAM LANZA AS THE

1503
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
GUNMAN WHO OPENED FIRE.

1504
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
THEY ALSO CONFIRM THAT HE DID

1505
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
KILL HIMSELF.

1506
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW YET?

1507
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
WHY?
WHY DID HE TARGET THE SCHOOL?

1508
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
WHY DID HE TARGET THOSE INNOCENT

1509
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
CHILDREN INSIDE?

1510
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
ALISON KOSIK WITH THE LATEST ON

SUSPECT'S HOME.

1513
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
GOOD MORNING, ALLISON.

1514
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
>> GOOD MORNING, JOHN.

1515
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
AND IT MAY BE A WHILE BEFORE WE

1516
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
KNOW THAT MOTIVE.
AT THIS MOMENT, WE ARE GETTING A

1517
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
CLOSER LOOK AT WHERE ADAM LANZA

1518
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
LIVED WITH HIS MOTHER NANCY, WHO

1519
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
HE ALSO SHOT AND KILLED BEFORE

1520
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
HE WENT TO SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

1521
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
SCHOOL.
A HOUSE, BIG HOUSE, SITTING ON

1522
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
TOP OF THE HILL TO MY LEFT.

1523
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
ALL THE LIGHTS ARE ON, A COUPLE

DRIVEWAY.

1526
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
WE'RE ALSO LEARNING NEW DETAILS

1527
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
OF HOW THIS GUNMAN BLASTED HIS

1528
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
WAY INTO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

1529
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
HOW MANY WEAPONS HE ON HIM, AND

1530
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
HOW MUCH AMMUNITION HE WAS

1531
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
CARRYING.
THE GUNMAN, ADAM LANZA, FIRED

1532
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,000
DOZENS OF BULLETS, USING A SEMI

1533
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
AUTOMATIC RIFLE ON HIS VICTIMS,

1534
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
USING A PISTOL TO KILL HIMSELF.

1535
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
>> THE VICTIM UTILIZED MOST OF

1536
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
THE TIME DURING THIS HORRIFIC

1537
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
CRIME, WAS IDENTIFIED A

01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
MILLIMETER, AND ONE OTHER

1542
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
WEAPON.

1543

>> A FOURTH WEAPON, A SHOTGUN

1544
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
WAS FOUND IN THE CAR PARKED

1545
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.

1546
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
THEY CONTINUE TO FOCUS THE

1547
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
EFFORT ON THE SCHOOL CRIME

1548
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000

LANZA VISITED A GUN RANGE.

WE'RE PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS

THANK YOU, ALLISON.

REIGNITED THE GUN CONTROL DEBATE

IN AMERICA.

1589
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA, INSISTING EARLY

1590
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
ON THAT THERE WAS MORE

1591
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
MEANINGFUL ACTION THAT NEEDED TO

1592
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
BE TAKEN TO PREVENT FUTURE

SUPPORTERS OF STRICTER GUN LAWS

1597
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,000
QUESTION ANYBODY'S RIGHT TO OWN

1598
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
>> THESE ARE ASSAULT WEAPONS.

1599

YOU DON'T HUNT DEER WITH THESE

1600
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
THINGS AND THAT'S THE QUESTION

01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TO

1602
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
RESOLVE THIS THEIR OWN MINDS.

1603
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
WHERE SHOULD THIS LINE GET

01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
DRAWN?

1605
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
>> A FREE PEOPLE SHOULD BE AN

1606

ARMED PEOPLE IT ENSURES AGAINST

01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
THE TYRANNY OF THE GOVERNMENT IF

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

MORE ABOUT GUN CONTROL AND

THERE IS A PHYSICAL PRESENCE, AS

1807
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
A REASSURING PRESENCE, MAY OR

1808
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
MAY NOT BE A FOOD IDEA.

1809
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
A LOT OF THINGS NOW WILL BE

1810
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
EXPLORED.
WE'RE REALLY IN UNCHARTERED

1811
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
TERRITORY NOW.

1812
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
NOW ABSOLUTELY NO-MAN'S LAND IN

1813
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT

1814
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

1815
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SITUATION.

1816
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
ONE EXAMPLE IN 2006 WHERE THE

1817
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
SCHOOL IN LANCASTER,

1818
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
PENNSYLVANIA, WAS INVADED, AND A

1819
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
LOT OF CHILDREN WERE MASSACRED

1820
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
THERE AND NOTHING MUCH HAPPENED.

1821
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
WITH THIS EVENT, I THINK WE'LL

1822
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
SEE SOME ACTION, A LOT OF

1823
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT WE'LL DO

1824
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
NEXT IN TERMS OF PROTECTING

1825
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
CHILDREN AND DON'T FORGET, THIS

1826
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
IS A VERY, VERY RARE OCCURRENCE.

1827
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
>> LET ME PLAY A LITTLE OF WHAT

1828
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID IN THE

1829
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
VIGIL.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL,

1830
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
VERY EMOTIONAL VIGIL LAST NIGHT.

1831
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
LET'S PLAY A LITTLE OF WHAT THE

1832
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
PRESIDENT SAID.

1833
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
>> IN THE COMING WEEKS, I WILL

1834
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
USE WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE

HOLDS TO ENGAGE MY FELLOW

1836
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000

TO MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS

1838
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
TO PARENTS AND EDUCATORS, IN AN

EFFORT AIMED AT PREVENTING MORE

1840
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS.

1841
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
>> HE BASICALLY SAID WE HAVE TO

1842
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
ENGAGE EVERYBODY IN FINDING A

1843
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
SOLUTION TO THIS, AND HE

1844
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
MENTIONED MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL.

1845
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
THERE IS THIS INTERSECTION

1846
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
BETWEEN ACCESS TO GUNS WHICH THE

1847
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
KILLER RELIED ON HEAVILY IN THIS

1848
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000

DESCRIPTIONS OF HIM BEING

1850
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
DISTURBED.
ANYONE WHO COMMITS A MASS

1851
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
MURDER, THAT'S FAIR TO SAY, AND

1852
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
OTHER INFORMATION COMING UP

1853
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
ABOUT HIS CHILDHOOD AS WELL.

1854
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
WHAT -- WHAT SHOULD THE FOCUS BE

1855
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
ON MENTAL HEALTH?

1856
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
WHICH PEOPLE DON'T DISCUSS VERY

1857
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
MUCH UNTIL THERE IS SOME KIND OF

1858
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
TRAGEDY LIKE THIS?

1859
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE

1860
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

1861
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
THAT HAVE ALL SORTS OF MENTAL

1862
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
HEALTH ISSUES FROM ANXIETY AND

1863
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
STRESS TO MUCH MORE SERIOUS

1864
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000

1865
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
THERE IS THE WHOLE SPECTRUM,

AUTISM --
>> THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO

1871
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
SAY.
NO CORRELATION BETWEEN AUTISM OR

1873
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000

01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
SO ALL I'M SAYING, WE HAVE A

1875
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000

01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,000
THAT WEREN'T EVEN USED.

2344
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
SOLEDAD.
>> ALISON KOSIK FOR US, OUTSIDE

2345

WITH HIS MOTHER, BOTH NOW

2347
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
DECEASED.

2348
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
LET'S GET BACK TO ZORAIDA

2350
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,000

ZORAIDA.
>> I DO, SOLEDAD.

2352
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
ACTUALLY, I'M AT TREADWELL PARK,

2353
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
WHERE MOST OF THE PRESS

2354
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
CONFERENCES TAKE PLACE.

2355
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
I WANT TO POINT SOMETHING OUT

2356
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
BEHIND ME, IS A SOCCER FIELD.

2357
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
YOU HAVE TO WONDER HOW MANY KIDS

2358
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
AND FAMILIES ENJOYED TIME HERE.

2359
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
WE WANT TO LEARN A LITTLE MORE

2360
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
ABOUT THESE KIDS.

2361
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
WE FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE SANDY

01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
THEY ARE DEVASTATED, BUT PROUD.

2369
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
>> DAWN PUT HERSELF IN JEOPARDY

2370
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
AND I HAVE BEEN ANGRY ABOUT

2371
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
THAT.

2372
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
ANGRY, UNTIL JUST NOW TODAY,

2373
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
WHEN I MET THE TWO WOMEN THAT

2374
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,000
SHE TOLD TO GO RUN TO SHELTER,

2375
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
WHILE SHE ACTUALLY CONFRONTED

2376
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
THE GUNMAN AND SHE COULD NOT --

2377
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
SHE COULD HAVE AVOIDED THAT AND

2378
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
SHE DIDN'T.

2379
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I KNEW THEY WOULDN'T.

2380
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
>> I DON'T THINK I WANT TO ASK

2381
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
YOU THIS.

2382
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO YOUR MOM

2383
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
RIGHT NOW?

2384
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
>> COME BACK.

2385
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,000
JUST COME BACK.

2386
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
>> JUST BREAKS YOUR HEART.

2387
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
DAWN'S DAUGHTER SAYS HER MOTHER

2388
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
WAS HER ROCK, AND NOW THEIR

2389
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
HERO.

2390
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
THE NEWTOWN TRAGEDY WAS FELT ALL

2391
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000

CRUZ SPOKE WITH THE BOY'S FAMILY

2400
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
AFTER LEARNING THEIR BOY WAS A

2401
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
BIG FAN.
THEY ARE CONSIDERING BURYING

2402
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
THEIR SON IN CRUZ' JERSEY.

2403
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
A REALLY EMOTIONAL MOMENT.

2404
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
CRUZ WANTED TO BE ABLE TO

2405
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
SOMEHOW EXPRESS HIS CONDOLENCES,

2406
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
JOHN AND SOLEDAD, SO HE CALLED

2407
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
THE FAMILY AND YOU KNOW, TRYING

2408
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HE ALSO CAN

2409
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
DO TO HELP.

2410
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FEELING THAT

2411
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

2412
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
>> I THINK THAT'S VERY TRUE.

2413
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,000
VERY HARD -- WHAT DO YOU DO.

2414
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
YOU LOOK AT PICTURES OF THE KIDS

2415
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
AND FEEL VERY POWERLESS.

2416
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,000
>> UNITED WAY, OTHER PLACES HAVE

2417
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
SET UP CHARITIES TO SEND MONEY,

2418
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
BUT PEOPLE WANT TO DO MORE THAN

2419
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
THAT.
THANKS, ZORAIDA.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

2423
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
IT WASN'T A TOPIC AT ALL.

2424
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,000
BUT NOW GUN CONTROL IS A TOPIC.

2425
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
WE'LL SPEAK WITH MARY BONO MACK

2426
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000

2437
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,000
YES!

Now, here's one that will
make you feel alive.

2445
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Meet the five-passenger
Ford C-MAX Hybrid.

2446
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
C-MAX says ha.

2447
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
C-MAX says wheeee.

2448
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Which is what you get,
don't you see?

2449
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Cause C-MAX has lots more
horsepower than Prius v,

2450
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,000
a hybrid that C-MAX
also bests in MPG.

2451
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Say hi to the all-new 47
combined MPG C-MAX Hybrid.

THIS TERM IS UP.

2487
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL

2488
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000

2489
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
FIRST, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

2490
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT AT THIS

2491
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
VIGIL.
HE DID SPEAK ABOUT MEASURES THAT

2492
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
SOUNDED LIKE HE WAS TALKING

2493
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL.

2494
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:47,000
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE

2495
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
SAID.

2496
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
>> IN THE COMING WEEKS I HAD USE

2497
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE HOLDS

01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
AIMED AT PREVENTING MORE

2503
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS.

2504
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
>> SO WHAT CAN BE DONE TO

2505
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
PREVENT THESE TRAGEDIES?

2506
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS ON

2507
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
THE RIGHT PATH HERE.

2508
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
THERE HAS TO BE AN AWFUL LOT

2509
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
THAT IS DONE.

2510
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
TO SIMPLY THROW OUT ONE QUICK

2511
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,000
ANSWER IS NOT DOING JUSTICE TO

2512
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
ANY OF THE VICTIMS AND THEIR

2513
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
FAMILIES RIGHT NOW.

2514
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT MENTAL

2515
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
HEALTH.
I THINK THE QUESTION OF GUN

2516
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
CONTROL, OF COURSE, WE SHOULD

2517
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
DEBATE THAT QUESTION.
THERE IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH WE

2518
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
REALLY HAVE TO DELVE INTO AND

2519
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
NOT LOOK FOR THE QUICK, QUICK,

2520
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
QUICK FIX.

2521
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
>> I THINK THAT EVERYONE IS

2522
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
WILLING, ABLE, AND EAGER TO TALK

2523
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
ABOUT THE FULL RANGE OF ISSUES

2524
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
RIGHT NOW.

2525
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
ONE OF THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT

2526
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
SAID LAST NIGHT, ONE OF THE MOST

2527
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
INTERESTING QUESTIONS, I HAVE

2528
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
BEEN ASKING MYSELF, HAVE WE DONE

2529
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP OUR

2530
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
KIDS SAFE?

2531
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
HE SAID WHEN HE SEARCHED HIS OWN

2532
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
FEELINGS, THE ANSWER WAS NO.

2533
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, CONGRESSMAN

2534
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
MACK, HAVE YOU BEEN DOING

2535
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO KEEP

2536
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
AMERICA'S KIDS SAFE?

2537
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,000
>> LET ME SAY THIS IS THE FIRST

2538
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
TIME WE'VE BEEN HERE, AND OUR

2539
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
HEARTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH THE

2540
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
FAMILIES, WITH THIS COMMUNITY,

2541
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:05,000
SUCH A TRAGIC EVENT THAT

2542
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
HAPPENED, IT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN

2543
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,000
TO ANY OF OUR CHILDREN OR OUR

2544
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
CITIZENS, BUT THE QUESTION YOU

2545
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
ASKED, HAVE WE DONE ENOUGH?

2546
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
THERE IS NOTHING -- YOU CAN'T DO

2547
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
EVERYTHING IT WOULD TAKE TO KEEP

2548
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
EVERYBODY SAFE, BUT WE NEED TO

2549
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
TRY TO DO MORE.

2550
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,000
LOOK, WE'RE HEARING ABOUT THE

2551
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
CHALLENGES THAT THIS -- THIS

2552
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
YOUNG MAN HAD, THE STORIES THAT

2553
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
HIS MOTHER WAS TELLING FRIENDS.

2554
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,000
THERE ARE WARNING SIGNS LEFT AND

2555
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
RIGHT ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN, AND

2556
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
WE NEED TO HAVE OUR COMMUNITIES

2557
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,000
IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN

2558
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
RECOGNIZE THOSE WARNING SIGNS

2559
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
AND ACT ON THOSE WARNING SIGNS.

2560
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,000
>> THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF SEEMED

2561
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
TO ADDRESS YOUR STATEMENT RIGHT

2562
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
THERE.

2563
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
HE SAID HELPLESSNESS ISN'T A

2564
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
REASON NOT TO TRY TO DO

2565
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
SOMETHING.
SO ON THE SUBJECT OF MENTAL

2566
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:53,000
HEALTH, SUCH A BIG CONCERN OF

2567
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,000
YOURS, CONGRESSMAN MACK WHAT IS

2568
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
THE GOVERNMENT ROLE WHEN IT

2569
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
COMES TO MENTAL HEALTH?

2570
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
IS THERE A ROLE?

2571
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
>> FOR ME, I HAVE BEEN FOCUSED A

2572
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
LOT ON THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG

2573
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
EPIDEMIC AND MOVING TO THE

2574
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, I

2575
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
SUPPORTED THE WELL STONE MENTAL

2576
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
HEALTH PARODY ACT.

2577
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
MENTAL HEALTH IS PART OF

2578
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,000
PHYSICAL HEALTH AND TREAT IT AS

2579
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,000
SUCH.
IT ISN'T JUST A GOVERNMENT ROLE.

2580
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
A FAMILY ROLE, A SOCIETAL ROLE,

2581
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
A CULTURAL ROLE, IT'S EVERYWH  E

2582
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
EVERYWHERE, IN OUR HOMES.

2583
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
EVERY PERSON IN AMERICA HAS TO

2584
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,000
ASK THE QUESTION, WE CAN'T JUST

2585
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
LOOK TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE

2586
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,000
ANSWER, ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE

2587
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,000
SOME ANSWERS THERE.

2588
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
JUST THIS MORNING ON THE DRIVE

2589
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,000
OVER HERE, I RESEARCHED THAT THE

2590
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
CENTER OF DISEASE CONTROL HAS AN

2591
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
AGENCY OR PROGRAM LOOK INTO

2592
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
THESE TYPES OF VIOLENCE.

2593
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THAT BEFORE

2594
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
UNTIL NOW, SO I WOULD LIKE KNOW

2595
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
IS IT FUNDED AT THE LEVEL IT

2596
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
SHOULD BE FUNDED, IS IT DOING

2597
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
WHAT IT SHOULD BE DOING?

2598
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
WHO IS IT REPORTING TO?

2599
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:58,000
>> ONE OF THE GREATEST SOURCES

2600
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
OF FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH

2601
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
ISSUES COMES FROM MEDICAID, OF

2602
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
COURSE.
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS A

2603
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,000
PARTISAN ISSUE, IT'S NOT A

2604
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:09,000
PARTISAN ISSUE, BUT THE RYAN

2605
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
BUDGET, FOR INSTANCE, INCLUDED

2606
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
VERY BIG CUTS IN SOME INSTANCES

2607
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
FOR MEDICAID.

2608
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
WOULD MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BE

2609
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
AFFECTED BY THE KIND OF CUTS

2610
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,000
THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED OVER

2611
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,000
THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

2612
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
>> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, I DON'T

2613
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,000
KNOW THAT QUESTION REALLY GETS

2614
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,000
TO THE HEART OF THIS.

2615
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
YOU SEE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

2616
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A LOT

2617
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
THAT'S UNKNOWN ABOUT MENTAL

2618
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
HEALTH.

2619
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
MENTAL HEALTH THERE, IS A STIGMA

2620
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
IN OUR SOCIETY ABOUT MEANTALITY

2621
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
HEALTH, WHICH THERE SHOULDN'T

2622
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,000
BE.

2623
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS

2624
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,000
OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT TO THE

2625
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES, AND

2626
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
SO MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS

2627
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
FUNDING AVAILABLE AND THAT WE

2628
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE -- WHEN WE

2629
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
SAY MENTAL HEALTH, PEOPLE DON'T

2630
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
EVEN REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT

2631
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
IS.
BUT WHEN WE HAVE YOUNG MEN IN

2632
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
OUR COMMUNITIES LIKE THE -- THE

2633
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
YOUNG MAN THAT COMMITTED THIS

2634
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
TRAGEDY, THESE MURDERS, THERE

2635
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
WERE WARNING SIGNS EVERYWHERE,

2636
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
AND WE NEED TO HAVE A SOCIETY

2637
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
THAT IS LOOKING FOR THOSE

2638
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,000
WARNING SIGNS AND KNOW HOW TO

2639
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
ACT.
RIGHT NOW, NO ONE WOULD KNOW HOW

2640
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
TO ACT ON THOSE ISSUES.

2641
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

2642
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
>> SENATOR JOE LIBERMAN, HIS

2643
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
LAST FEW WEEKS AS SENATOR, HAS

2644
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
SUGGESTED DOING A NATIONAL

2645
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
COMMISSION OF SOME KIND TO LOOK

2646
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
INTO ALL OF THESE ISSUES, I

2647
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
THINK.
THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, GUN

2648
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
CONTROL.

2649
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,000
WOULD THIS BE A GOOD IDEA?

2650
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE COME

2651
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,000
THAT?
>> I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

2652
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A

2653
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
NATIONAL DIALOG, PUT EVERYTHING

2654
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
ON THE TABLE.

2655
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
EVERY PARENT OR GRANDPARENT

2656
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,000
SHOULD EXPECT THAT.
EVERYTHING SHOULD BE ON THE

2657
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
TABLE AND HAVE A REASONED

2658
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,000
DEBATE.
BACK TO THE QUESTION ABOUT THE

2659
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
RYAN BUDGET, THE REASON IT'S

2660
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
IMPORTANT TO SAY THIS, ALTHOUGH

2661
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
I SUPPORT THE RYAN BUDGET, IT'S

2662
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
SO HARD TO ALWAYS PUT THESE

2663
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
THINGS IN THE TERMS OF BUDGETS.

2664
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,000
THE COUNTRY IS FACED WITH CUTS,

2665
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
BUT I SUPPORT INCREASING

2666
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
MEDICAID AND SUPPORTED S CHIP

2667
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,000
AND INCREASED MEDICAID FUNDING

2668
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
ON THE STATE LEVEL.

2669
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
WE LOOK AT POLITICAL ANSWERS, WE

2670
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,000
SHOULDN'T JUMP ON SOMETHING AND

2671
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,000
OVERSIMPLIFY IT.

2672
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,000
PARENTS DESERVE BETTER.

2673
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
THE VICTIMS OF THIS HEINOUS

2674
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
TRAGEDY DESERVE BETTER, AND I

2675
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
THINK WE AS A COUNTRY NEED TO

2676
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
QUIT SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER AND

2677
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
TRY TO FIND THE INSTANT PROBLEMS

2678
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
AND EXPLOIT THEM.

2679
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
EVERYTHING SHOULD BE ON THE

2680
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
TABLE.
SENATOR LIBERMAN IS RIGHT.

2681
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
>> THE MACKS, THANK YOU, BOTH,

2682
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
SO MUCH.

2683
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
I KNOW YOU JUST DID ARRIVE HERE.

2684
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
SO MOVING TO BE HERE IN THIS

2685
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
TOWN WHERE THE TRAGEDY DID

2686
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,000
HAPPEN.

2687
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
AND AS YOU SAID, SOMETIMES WORDS

2688
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
LIKE BUDGETS AND FUNDING, THIS

2689
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
AND THAT, COLD WORDS DEALING

2690
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
WITH THE TRAGEDY.

2691
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT.

2692
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
>>> OF COURSE, AS WE MENTIONED,

2693
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA DID PLAY THE

2694
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
ROLE AS COMFORTER IN CHIEF IN

2695
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
NEWTOWN, TELLING PEOPLE IN THIS

2696
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
COMMUNITY, THEY ARE NOT ALONE

2697
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
AND THEY ARE NOT ALONE.

2698
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
MORE FROM LAST NIGHT'S VIGIL,

2699
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
COMING UP.

2700
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,000
