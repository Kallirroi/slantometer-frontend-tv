1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
>> FOR THOSE OF US WHO REMAIN,

2
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
LET US FIND THE STRENGTH TO

3
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
CARRY ON.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
KATIE: IF YOU'RE LIKE MOST

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
AMERICANS, IT WAS NEARLY

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP THINKING

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED FRIDAY

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
MORNING AT SANDY HOOK

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
ELEMENTARY IN NEWTOWN,

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
CONNECTICUT.
WE FELT BOTH DEEP SADNESS AND

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
OUTRAGE.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
IT WAS INCOMPREHINSIBLE AND SO

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
OVERWHELMING.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
TODAY, WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
HAPPENED, THOUGH WE'LL NEVER

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
UNDERSTAND IT.
AND TRY TO FIND THE ANSWER TO

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
WHAT SO MANY OF US ASKED

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
OURSELVES OVER THE WEEKEND.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
OH MY GOD, WHAT IS THE WORLD

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
COMING TO?
27 LIVES LITERALLY SNUFFED OUT.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
BRAVE TEACHERS AND

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
ADMINISTRATORS AND A MOTHER

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
ANDED BY HER OWN FLESH

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
BLOOD.
BUT THE CHILDREN, 20 OF THEM,

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
SO YOUNG AND SMALL AND SO MUCH

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
AHEAD OF THEM, THEIR DEATHS

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
SEEM TOO MUCH TO BEAR.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I WENT TO NEWTOWN LAST NIGHT

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
AND SPOKE TO TWO FAMILIES.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
ONE LOST THEIR FIRST BORN

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
DAUGHTER, ANOTHER THEIR BABY

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
BOY.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
TO TRULY UNDERSTAND THIS

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
TRAGEDY WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
DEPTH OF THE LOSS AND THE

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
EXCRUCIATING PAIN.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
WE BEGIN WITH MARK AND JACKIE

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
BARDEN.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
THEIR SON DANIEL WAS A FIRST

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
GRADER AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
SCHOOL AND LEAVES BEHIND HIS

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
TWO SIBLINGS, NATALIE AND JAMES.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
JAMES IS 12 AND WANTED A CHANCE

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
LITTLE ABOUT HIS

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
BROTHER.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
WHAT WAS IT LIKE SPENDING TIME

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA?

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
WAS THAT HELPFUL FOR YOU ALL?

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
>> TO BE HONEST, IT WAS A LITTLE

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
LESS FRUITFUL THAN WE WERE

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
HOPING.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
JAMES AND OUR DAUGHTER NATALIE

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
HAD A FEW THINGS THEY WERE

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
HOPING TO EXPRESS TO HIM OUT OF

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
CONCERN FOR THE WAY, THE FACT

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
ATT THIS SITUATION HAPPENED
ALL AND HOW WE CAN MAYBE,

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
HOPEFULLY STOP THIS FROM

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
HAPPENING AGAIN.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
MY DAUGHTER NATALIE WAS

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
INTERESTED IN ASKING HIM IF HE

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
COULD PASS SOME LEGISLATION SO

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAD

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
GUNS WERE MILITARY PERSONNEL
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
AND IF PEOPLE NEEDED GUNS FOR

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
SPORT, THEY COULD GO TO A RANGE

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
AND THE GUNS WOULD HAVE TO STAY

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
THERE.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
THAT WAS MY 10-YEAR-OLD

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
DAUGHTER.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
THAT WAS ALL HER OWN ORIGINAL

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
THOUGHT.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
>> SHE JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
HOW ANYBODY COULD HAVE ACCESS,

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
WALK INTO A SCHOOL WITH THIS

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
STUFF.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
KATIE: WHAT DID YOU WANT TO ASK

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
AM, JAMES, IF YOU HAD HAD

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
CHANCE TO TALK TO THE PRESIDENT

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
A LITTLE MORE?

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
>> I WANTED TO ASK HIM WHAT HE

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
WAS GOING TO DO TO MAKE SURE

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
BECAUSE IT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
AGAIN, NO ONE SHOULD EVER HAVE

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
TO GO THROUGH THIS.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
KATIE: HOW WILL YOU ALL USE

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
THIS?

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
OR WILL YOU BE ABLE TO USE THIS

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
TO TRY TO INACT SOME KIND OF

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
CHANGE?

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
>> WE'RE STILL NOT EVEN REALLY

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
FULLY AWARE, OR REALLY HAVEN'T

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
PROCESSED OR ABSORBED OR

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
DIGESTED THE FACT THAT OUR

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
SWEET LITTLE DANIEL IS NOT HERE

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
WITH US ANY MORE.

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
THAT'S ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
WITH AT THIS MOMENT.

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
KATIE: TELL ME A LITTLE BIT

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
ABOUT DANIEL.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
>> IN ONE WORD, DANIEL WAS A

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
LIGHT.

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
AND WHEN I TELL YOU, WHEN HE

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
WAS 4 YEARS OLD, HE WAS SELECTED

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
TO BE PART OF A PROGRAM WHERE

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
HE WAS PAIRED UP WITH SPECIAL

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
NEEDS CHILDREN IN A PRESCHOOL

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
ENVIRONMENT, AND HE WAS

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
SELECTED FOR THAT BECAUSE HIS

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
PERSONALITY WAS PERFECT FOR

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
THAT.

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
KATIE: TO HELP OUT THE OTHER

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
KIDS.

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
>> AND HE WAS ONLY SUPPOSED TO

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
BE IN THE ENVIRONMENT WITH THEM.

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
>> BUT TEACHERS USED TO ALWAYS
COMMENT --

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
>> IF HE NOTICED SOMEBODY

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
SITTING BY THEMSELVES, HE WOULD

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
NOTICE THAT AND ASK THE TEACHER

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
CAN I BE EXCUSED TO GO SIT WITH

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
THIS PERSON?

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL ALONE AND

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
HE WOULD TRY TO COMFORT THEM.

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
AT 4.

125
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
AND FROM THEN ON, EVERY

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
PARENT/TEACHER CONFERENCE WE'VE

127
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
HAD, WE HEARD THE EXACT SAME

128
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
THING.

129
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
>> HOW UNUSUAL HE WAS.

130
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
>> HE WAS DIFFERENT IN THAT WAY.

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
>> OUR NEIGHBORS ALWAYS SAID

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
HE'S LIKE AN OLD SOUL.

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
THE DAY THAT HE WENT TO SCHOOL

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
THAT DAY, HE GOT UP EARLY.

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
AS HE ALWAYS DID, MARK SAID.

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
WE TALKED AND HE SAID I

137
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
FOOSE BALL WITH HIM BEFORE

138
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
SCHOOL.

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
WE HAVE A FOOSBALL TABLE, OF

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
COURSE HE BEAT ME 10-8.

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
>> I HAD HIM AT FIRST.

142
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO.

143
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
>> THEN MARK TAUGHT HIM HOW TO

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
PLAY "JINGLE BELLS" ON THE

145
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
PIANO.

146
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
>> YEAH, WE DID A LOT IN THAT

147
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
HALF-HOUR.

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
SO, WE HELD HANDS ON THE WAY TO

149
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
THE BUS.

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
THAT WAS OUR LAST MORNING

151
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
TOGETHER.

152
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
HE DID GET UP EARLY THAT

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
MORNING AND RAN DOWN THE

154
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
DRIVEWAY SO HE COULD KISS HIS

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
BROTHER GOOD-BYE IN HIS PAJAMAS.

156
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
IT WAS 22 DEGREES.

157
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
HE WAS EXCEPTIONAL.

158
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
KATIE: OH JAMES, SO SORRY.

159
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
YOUR CHILDREN ARE REALLY,

160
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
OBVIOUSLY UNDERSTANDABLY IN SO

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
MUCH PAIN, BREAKS MY HEART TO

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
SEE HIM LIKE THIS.

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
>> HE'S BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
TIME CONSOLING HIS LITTLE

165
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
SISTER.

166
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
HE'S DONE A WONDERFUL JOB

167
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
HOLDING HER, TRYING TO EXPLAIN

168
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
TO HER WE'RE GOING TO GET

169
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
THROUGH THIS.

170
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
HE'S BEEN A ROCK FOR HIS LITTLE

171
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
SISTER.

172
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
KATIE: WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS

173
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
YOUNG MAN WHO DID THIS --

174
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
>> I DON'T.

175
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
>> WE DON'T.

176
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
WE REALLY HAVEN'T EVEN GONE

177
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
THERE.

178
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
>> NOT INTERESTED.

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER.

180
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
>> WE'RE CONCERNED WITH THE

181
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
FAMILIES THAT ARE SUFFERED THIS

182
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
HORRIBLE LOSS.
IT'S ABOUT THEM.

183
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
KATIE: WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU LIKE

184
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR SON?

185
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
>> OUR SON HAD SO MUCH LOVE TO

186
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
GIVE TO THIS WORLD.

187
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
AND HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A

188
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
WHOLE LIFETIME OF BRINGING THAT

189
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
LIGHT TO THE WORLD.

190
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
AND EVERYONE, ALL OF US HAVE

191
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
SUFFERED A LOSS BECAUSE THAT

192
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
WON'T BE REALIZED.

193
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
KATIE: WHAT ABOUT YO

194
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU

195
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
THINK PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT

196
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER?

197
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
>> HE WAS JUST SO SWEET AND

198
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
KIND, AND THOUGHTFUL.

199
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
HE WOULD ALWAYS -- HE WAS SO

200
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
GOOD AT MAKING SURE THAT HE

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
CLEANED UP AFTER HIMSELF,

202
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
TURNED OFF ALL HIS LIGHTS --

203
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
>> HIS LIGHTS.

204
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
>> CLOSE THE DOOR.

205
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
>> CLOSE EVERY DOOR.

206
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
ST WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL.

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
>> HE WOULD HOLD DOORS OPEN FOR

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
ADULTS ALL THE TIME.

209
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'D BE ALREADY HALFWAY ACROSS

210
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
THE PARKING LOT LOOKING BACK AND

211
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
HIM AND HE WAS HOLDING THE DOOR

212
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
FOR SOMEBODY COMING DOWN THE

213
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
AISLE.

214
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
KATIE: SOUNDS KIND OF LIKE HE

215
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
WAS PERFECT.
>> YEAH.

216
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
>> IT DOES, DOESN'T IT?

217
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
>> BECAUSE HE WAS.

218
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
KATIE: ONE QUESTION MARK BARDEN

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
ASKED ME FOLLOWING THAT

220
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
INTERVIEW IS HOW CAN A MERCYFUL

221
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
GOD LET SOMETHING LIKE THIS

222
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
HAPPEN?
LATER WE'LL ASK JOEL OSTEEN

223
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
ABOUT THAT.

224
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

KATIE: ROBBY PARKER AND HIS WIFE

227
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
ALYSSA MOVED EIGHT MONTHS AGO TO

228
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT BECAUSE HE

229
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
GOT A JOB AS A PHYSICIANS

230
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
ASSISTANT AT THE HOSPITAL.

231
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
THAT'S WHERE HE WAS WHEN THE

232
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
SHOOTING HAPPENED.

233
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
THE HOSPITAL WENT INTO LOCKDOWN

234
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
AND HE WENT TO THE EMERGENCY

235
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
ROOM EXPECTING THAT SOME OF THE

236
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
CHILDREN MIGHT BE TAKEN THERE.

237
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
HE FINALLY MADE HIS WAY TO THE

238
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
FIRE HOUSE WHERE HIS WIFE ALYSSA

239
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
WAS WAITING DESPERATE FOR ANY

240
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
NEWS ABOUT THEIR 6-YEAR-OLD

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
DAUGHTER EMILIE.

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
>> SHE WAS A VERY SPECIAL GIRL.

243
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
E

244
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
WE FIND COMFORT IN THE FACT THAT

245
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
SHE WAS ABLE TO TOUCH OUR LIVES

246
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
AND THE LIVES OF SO MANY PEOPLE

247
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
IS REALLY A HEART-WARMING THING

248
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
TO US.

249
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
AND IT BRINGS A LOT OF HAPPINESS

250
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
AND WE KNOW THAT'S THE KIND OF

251
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
GIRL SHE WAS AND WE CAN BE PROUD

252
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
OF THAT.

253
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
KATIE: ALYSSA, HOW ARE YOU

254
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
DOING?

255
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
>> I'VE BEEN ASKED THAT QUITE A

256
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
BIT.

257
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I HAVEN'T YET COME UP WITH A

258
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
WORD THAT IS APPROPRIATE.

259
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
IT'S JUST -- IT'S HARD AND I'M

260
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
TAKING IT, HONESTLY A MINUTE AT

261
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
A TIME.

262
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
BECAUSE THAT'S ABOUT ALL I CAN

263
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
DO.

264
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
KATIE: YOU ALL HAVE TWO LITTLE

265
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
GIRLS IN ADDITION TO EMILIE.

266
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
>> MADELINE'S 4 AND SARA IS 3.

267
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
KATIE: DO THEY UNDERSTAND AT ALL

268
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

269
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
>> THEY JUST KNOW THEIR BEST

270
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
FRIEND HASN'T BEEN AROUND, AND

271
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
AS FAR AS WHAT THAT'S GOING TO

272
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
MEAN TO THEM AS THE DAYS GO ON,

273
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.

274
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
KATIE: HOW DID YOU LEARN WHAT

275
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
HAD HAPPENED?

276
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
>> WHEN I CAME IN TO THE FIRE

277
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
STATION, SOMEBODY HAD TOLD THE

278
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
FAMILIES IN THAT ROOM THAT THERE

279
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
WERE 20 CHILDREN THAT WERE DEAD

280
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
AND, SO THAT WAS THE FIRST NEWS

281
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
THAT I RECEIVED WHEN I WALKED

282
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
IN.

283
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
AND SO WE WERE ALL JUST HOPING,

284
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW MANY

285
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
PEOPLE WERE IN THE SCHOOL, HOW

286
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
MANY HAD MADE IT TO THE

287
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
HOSPITAL.

288
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
SO EVERYBODY IN THAT ROOM WAS

289
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
HOLDING ONTO SOME KIND OF HOPE

290
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
THAT MAYBE, I'M SO SORRY FOR ALL

291
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
OF YOU, BUT AT LEAST OUR CHILD

292
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
ISN'T ONE OF THOSE.

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
>> MOST OF US KNEW THE NUMBER.

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
ROBBY DIDN'T SEE BECAUSE THEY

295
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
HAD WRITTEN A LIST SO WE HAD

296
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
COUNTED HOW MANY WERE ON THERE,

297
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
SO WE KNEW OUR ODDS WEREN'T VERY

298
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
GOOD AT THAT MOMENT.

299
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
>> AND THEN EVENTUALLY THE

300
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
GOVERNOR CAME IN AND BASICALLY

301
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
GOT AROUND TO SAYING THAT ALL

302
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
THE CHILDREN THAT ARE IN THE

303
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
SCHOOL AREN'T GOING TO MAKE IT

304
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
OUT.

305
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
AND SO, AT THAT P

306
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
OUNCE OF HOPE IN THAT ROOM LEFT.

307
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
KATIE: SO FROM HOPE TO ANGUISH.

308
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
>> IN A SECOND.

309
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
KATIE: YOU MET WITH THE

310
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
PRESIDENT TODAY.

311
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
AND HE SPENT SOME TIME WITH YOU

312
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
AND SOME OTHER MEMBERS OF YOUR

313
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
FAMILY.

314
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT

315
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
MEETING?
WHAT THAT WAS LIKE FOR YOU ALL?

316
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
>> I THINK THE ONE THING THAT

317
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
STUCK OUT TO ME IS THAT HE SAID

318
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
ABOUT, HE WAS THERE REPRESENTING

319
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
THE NATION AND THE COUNTRY.

320
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
AND HOW EVERYONE'S BEEN SO AWARE

321
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
OF OUR SITUATION AND ALL THE

322
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
FAMILIES IN OUR SITUATION.

323
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY --

324
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
THEY'RE ALL SUCH AMAZING KIDS.

325
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
JUST THAT EVERYONE HAS

326
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
CONCERNED FOR NOT ONLY US, BUT

327
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
ALL OF THOSE FAMILIES AND I FELT

328
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
LIKE YOU KNOW, THAT WAS A GOOD

329
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
REPRESENTATION OF THE SUPPORT

330
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
THAT WE'VE JUST BEEN FEELING

331
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
FROM EVERYONE.

332
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
KATIE: AND YOU WERE ABLE TO SEE

333
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
SOME OF THE OTHER FAMILIES

334
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
TONIGHT.

335
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
AND, WAS THAT HELPFUL IN A WAY?

336
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
>> WE FOUND IT VERY HELPFUL.

337
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
IT WAS VERY CLEAR THEY KNOW

338
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GOING

339
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
THROUGH.

340
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
SO THAT I THINK IS SOMETHING

341
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
THAT WILL UNITE US FOREVER AND

342
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
HELP US COPE ABOUT EVERYTHING

343
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
TOGETHER.
KATIE: YOU SAID THAT YOU HAVE NO

344
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
ANGER TOWARD THE YOUNG MAN WHO

345
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
DID THIS.
>> I REALLY DON'T.

346
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
FROM WHAT WE'VE LEARNED, HE WAS

347
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
SOMEONE WHO WAS STRUGGLING WITH

348
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY, VERY

349
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
DARK AND SOMETHING THAT HE

350
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
STRUGGLED WITH MIGHTILY.

351
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
AND HE STRUGGLES WITH SOMETHING

352
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
DIFFERENT THAN THE STRUGGLES

353
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
THAT I HAVE IN MY LIFE.

354
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
SO I CAN'T HAVE ANY JUDGMENT

355
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
TOWARDS HIM FOR THOSE THINGS

356
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

357
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
FIGHTING.

358
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
KATIE: HOW ABOUT YOU ALYSSA?

359
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE YOUNG

360
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
MAN WHO DID THIS?

361
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
>> YOU KNOW, AS HARD AS IT IS TO

362
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
DEAL WITH, THE LOSS OF MY

363
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
DAUGHTER, I FEEL VERY BLESSED BY

364
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
MY HEAVENLY FATHER THAT THAT'S

365
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
NOT SOMETHING I'VE EVEN HAD TO

366
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
STRUGGLE WITH AT ALL.

367
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT WOULD

368
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
OVERWHELM ME IF I WAS FEELING

369
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
HATRED FOR HIM, OR ANGER.

370
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
ALL I FELT WAS SADNESS, REALLY.

371
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
AND STILL TO THIS DAY, ALL I

372
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
FELT WAS JUST SAD.

373
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I FELT BAD FOR HIM.

374
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE THE

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
AND PART OF OUR MISSION IS TO

560
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
RESPOND TO SUCH.

561
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
FIVE YEARS LATER WE'VE BEEN ABLE

562
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
TO EDUCATE OURSELVES AND TO BE

563
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
ABLE TO HELP, BECAUSE IT'S NOT

564
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
ABOUT US, IT IS ABOUT THEM.

565
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
>> WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO

566
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
ENCOURAGE THEM THAT RIGHT NOW

567
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
THEY CAN'T SEE ANY LIGHT AT THE

568
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
END OF THIS TUNNEL BECAUSE THE

569
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
TUNNEL IS SO DARK AND SO LONG.

570
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
BECAUSE THIS PROCESS IS VERY

571
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
LONG AND ONGOING.

572
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
BUT THERE IS A LIGHT, IT MAY

573
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
TAKE YEARS TO GET THERE, BUT

574
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
THERE DOES COME A DAY WHERE YOU

575
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
DON'T CRY ALL DAY LONG.

576
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
YOU CAN LAUGH, YOU HAVE JOY

577
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
AGAIN IN YOUR LIFE.

578
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
COLUMBINE WAS LIKE GETTING HIT

579
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
WITH A FREIGHT TRAIN AND NOT

580
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
EVEN KNOWING WHAT HIT YOU.

581
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
IT DEVASTATES YOU.

582
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
THE PAIN IS SO GREAT YOU CAN'T

583
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
BREATHE.

584
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
YOU WANT TO DIE, BUT YOU'RE

585
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
GOING TO WAKE UP THE NEXT

586
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
MORNING.
AND IT COMES IN SURGES, YOU

587
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
KNOW.
THERE'S TIMES WHEN YOU'RE SO

588
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
OVERWHELMED BY IT, I THINK THE

589
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
LORD CREATED US TO WHERE SOME OF

590
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
THOSE THINGS ARE BLOCKED OUT.

591
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
AND THERE'S A BARRIER OR A

592
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
CUSHION THERE FOR A WHILE UNTIL

593
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
WE CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND IT.

594
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE ANY

595
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
UNDERSTANDING AT THIS POINT,

596
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
THEY'RE JUST DEALING WITH THE

597
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
FACTS OF THIS.

598
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
BUT, I KNOW, I KNOW THAT THEY

599
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
WILL SURVIVE THIS.

600
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I KNOW THROUGH THE COMMUNITY AND

601
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
THE LOVE AND THE SUPPORT THAT

602
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
COMES FROM THEIR FRIENDS AND

603
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
FAMILY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

604
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
THEY'LL GET SO MUCH HELP AND

605
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
ENCOURAGEMENT WITH THAT.

606
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
AND IT MEANT THE WORLD TO US, WE

607
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
HAD THE WHOLE WORLD REACHING OUT

608
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
TO THEM AND I KNOW NEWTOWN HAS

609
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
THE SAME THING AVAILABLE TO

610
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
THEM.

611
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
EVERYBODY WANTS TO DO ANYTHING

612
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
THEY CAN TO HELP.

613
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
AND IT REALLY MAKES A

614
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
DIFFERENCE.
KATIE: CRAIG, I KNOW YOU HAVE

615
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
SAID LOOK AT THE LIGHT IN THE

616
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
DARK PLACES, BUT YOU HAVE

617
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
STRUGGLED VERY A LONG TIME AFTER

618
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
LOSING RACHEL.

619
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED THAT WILL

620
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
HELP SOME OF THESE FAMILY

621
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
MEMBERS THAT WILL HELP JAMES,

622
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
WHO WITH 12 YEARS OLD, THAT

623
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
INCONSOLEABLE AND BROKENHEARTED?

624
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
>> WELL, I WENT THROUGH A LOT OF

625
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
ANGER AND I HATED THE SHOOTERS

626
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
AT COLUMBINE FOR A LONG TIME AND

627
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
HELD ONTO THAT ANGER AND IT

628
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
STARTED TO AFFECT MY FAMILY.

629
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
AND I HAD TO THINK ABOUT WHO I

630
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
WANTED TO BE DOWN THE ROAD.

631
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
AND TO JAMES, I WOULD SAY YOU

632
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
KNOW, USE THE MEMORY OF YOUR

633
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
BROTHER NOW AND ALL THAT HE WAS

634
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
AND ALL THE GOODNESS THAT HE WAS

635
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
AND THE PERFECTION AND USE WHO

636
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
HE WAS AS A FORCE IN YOUR LIFE

637
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
NOW.

638
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
YOU EXPRESS THAT TO THE WORLD.

639
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
YOU LET THE WORLD GET TO SEE

640
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER THROUGH YOU.

641
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
AND FOR ME, I EVENTUALLY HAD TO

642
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
LET GO OF MY ANGER AND HATRED

643
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
TOWARDS THE SHOOTERS AND I DID

644
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
THAT FOR FORGIVING THEM FOR WHAT

645
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
THEY HAD DONE.

646
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
NOT TO SAY WHAT SOMEONE DOES IS

647
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
OK, BUT IT'S A LETTING GO OF.

648
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
IT REALLY DID HELP ME HEAL NOW

649
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
TO THE POINT WHERE I'M ABLE TO

650
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
GO AND DO WHAT IT IS THAT I DO

651
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
IN SHARING RACHEL'S STORY IN

652
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
SCHOOLS, AND INSPIRING OTHER

653
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
STUDENTS TO STEP OUT IN

654
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
COMPASSION FOR OTHERS, AND SHOW

655
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
KINDNESS, WHICH HAS BEEN A BIG

656
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
ANTI-DOTE TO THAT ANGER AND

657
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
HATRED THAT IS BREWING IN A LOT

658
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND A LOT OF

659
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
TEENS TODAY.

660
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
KATIE: I AM SO HAPPY TO SEE ALL

661
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
OF YOU.

662
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'M SO SORRY UNDER THESE

663
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
CIRCUMSTANCES.

664
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.

665

SCOTT WHOSE SISTER RACHEL WAS

KILLED IN THE COLUMBINE

671

SHOOTINGS, AND HIS AND RACHEL'S

MOTHER BETH NIMMO.

673
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
AND ALSO JOINED BY DAVE CULLEN,

674
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
THE AUTHOR OF COLUMBINE, THE

675
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
DEFINITIVE BOOK ON THAT TRAGEDY

676
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
IN COLORADO.
I KNOW YOU WORKED ON THIS BOOK

677
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
FOR 10 YEARS AND YOU STUDIED

678
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
DYLAN KLEBOLD AND ERIC HARRIS.

679
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
IT SEEMS TO ME THE PERPETRATORS

680
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
IN THESE INCIDENTS, THEY'RE

681
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
EARLY SIMILAR IN TERMS OF THEIR

682
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
BACK GROUNDS.

683
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
TELL US WHAT YOU LEARNED.

684
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
>> OK.

685
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
SURE.
A COUPLE OF THINGS.

686
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
ONE IS THAT THERE'S A VARIETY OF

687
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
DIFFERENT TYPES OF KILLERS.

688
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
THE FIRST IS RARE, BUT ERIC

689
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
HARRIS AT COLUMBINE, A SADISTIC

690
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
PSYCHOPATH.

691
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
THEN WE ALSO HAVE FAIRLY

692
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
UNUSUAL, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

693
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
DEEPLY MENTALLY ILL IN THE SENSE

694
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
OF REALLY OUT OF TOUCH OF

695
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
REALITY AND NOT UNDERSTANDING,

696
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
THAT WAS TRUE OF JOE AT VIRGINIA

697
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
TECH AND ANOTHER SHOOTER IN

698
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
TUCSON.

699
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
IT'S USUALLY NOT THE CASE AND WE

700
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO

701
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
STIGAMATIZE PEOPLE BECAUSE

702
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
THEY'RE USUALLY NOT VIOLENT.

703
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
THE THIRD ONE WHICH TENDS TO BE

704
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
THE MOST COMMON ARE THE DEEPLY

705
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
SUICIDALLY DEPRESSED.
THIS IS NOT WHAT WE THINK OF AS

706
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
A DEPRESSED, MOROSE PERSON.

707
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
BUT THESE PEOPLE REACH SUCH A

708
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS AND

709
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
HOPELESSNESS, WHERE THEY'RE

710
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
READY TO LASH OUT AND DO

711
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T REALLY

712
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
EVEN MAKE SENSE TO THEM

713
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
COMPLETELY, WHICH IS IRRATIONAL,

714
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO LASH OUT IN

715
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
SOME EXTREME WAY.

716
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T KNOW

717
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
EXACTLY HA THEY'RE GOING TO DO.

718
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THEY'VE GOT THE GUNS, BUT

719
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
THEY'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT

720
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH THEM OR

721
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
HOW FAR THEY'LL TAKE IT.

722
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
KATIE: ARE THERE WARNING SIGNS?

723
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
ARE THERE THINGS PARENTS CAN

724
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
TICK UP ON SO THEY REALIZE THEIR

725
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
CHILD IS CAPABLE OF THIS KIND OF

726
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
VIOLENCE OR NOT?

727
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
>> WELL, YES AND NO.

728
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
THERE ARE WARNING SIGNS OF THE

729
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
DEEP DEPRESSION AND OF THE

730
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
REALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION.

731
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
THERE'S NOT REALLY A WARNING

732
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
SIGN THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

733
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
VIOLENT OR MASS MURDER, BECAUSE

734
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
ACTUALLY THERE'S ABOUT A FEW

735
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
MILLIONED A LESS SENTS THAT ARE

736
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
CLINLY DEPRESSED IN THE U.S.,

737
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
MOST UNDIAGNOSED.

738
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
BUT THEY TEND TO LOOK VERY

739
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
SIMILAR.
IF WE'VE GOT A FEW MILLION

740
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
PEOPLE WITH THAT, THE 10 OR 15

741
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
OR 20 WHO ARE GOING TO GO

742
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
VIOLENT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE

743
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
THIS, THEY'RE INDISTINGUISHABLE.

744
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
KATIE: I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

745
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
POINT OUT THAT YOU ACTUALLY

746
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
REACHED OUT TO SUE KLEBOLD,

747
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
DYLAN KLEBOLD'S MOTHER AFTER THE

748
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
TRAGEDY.

749
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
WHY WAS THAT?

750
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
>> I HAD A HEART FOR THE PARENTS

751
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
OF THESE TWO SHOOTERS.

752
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
THE WORLD CAME TO OUR RESCUE.

753
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
THEY EMBRACED US, THEY CONSOLED

754
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
WITH US AND THE SHOOTERS PARENTS

755
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
IN THIS SITUATION WERE VILL

756
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
ANNIZED.
THEY WERE REJECTED.

757
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
PEOPLE WANTED ANOTHER POUND OF

758
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
FLESH, BECAUSE THE BOYS HAD

759
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
TAKEN THEIR LIFE.

760
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
SO, YOU WANT TO PUT BLAME

761
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
SOMEWHERE, YOU WANT SOMETHING TO

762
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
POINT YOUR ANGER TOWARDS.

763
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
AND I ACTUALLY FELT KIND OF BAD

764
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
ABOUT THAT, AND SO I DID NINE

765
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
MONTHS AFTER THE FACT MET WITH

766
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
SUE, AND AS I WAS GOING IN

767
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
THERE, I ASKED THE LORD, I SAID

768
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I HAVE NO CRY DEE WHAT TO SAY TO

769
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
THIS LADY.

770
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
AND HE SAID JUST ASK HER WHO HER

771
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
SON WAS BEFORE APRIL 20 OF 1999.

772
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
AND I DID, AND TEARS JUST ROLLED

773
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
DOWN HER FACE AND SHE TALKED

774
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
ABOUT THIS LITTLE BOY GROWING

775
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
UP, AND YOU KNOW, A NORMAL

776
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
LITTLE CHILD AND THEN AS HE GOT

777
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
INTO HIS OLDER HIGH SCHOOL

778
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
YEARS, SHE SAW A CHANGE TAKE

779
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
PLACE IN HIM WHERE HE WAS

780
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
DISTANCING HIMSELF.

781
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
SHE TOLD ME THE ONLY THING THAT

782
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
GAVE AWAY THE FACT THAT DYLAN

783
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
WAS DOING SOMETHING THAT THEY

784
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
WEREN'T AWARE OF WAS HE WOULD

785
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH HER

786
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
ANY MORE.

787
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
AND OUTSIDE OF THAT HE PLAYED

788
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
THE GAME PERFECTLY.

789
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
THEY HAD GONE TO CHECK OUT

790
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
SCHOOLS FOR COLLEGE, I MEAN,

791
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
THERE WAS NO INDICATION AT ALL

792
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
THAT HE WAS PLANNING TO DIE IN

793
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
TWO DAYS, YOU KNOW?

794
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
AND COMMIT THIS AWFUL ACT.

795
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
SO, THESE PARENTS, SOMETIMES ARE

796
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
JUST BLINDSIDED BY WHAT'S GOING

797
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
ON.
AND I HAVE A COMPASSION FOR

798
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
THAT, BECAUSE THANKFULLY MY

799
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
CHILDREN HAVE NEVER COMMITTED

800
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
ANYTHING AS HEINOUS AS MASS

801
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
SHOOTING OR A SHOOTING OF ANY

802
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
ONE PERSON FOR THAT, BUT I CAN

803
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
IMAGINE THE GUILT, THE REGRET

804
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
AND THE REMORSE AS A PARENT THAT

805
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
YOU JUST BEAT YOURSELF UP ABOUT

806
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
OVER AND OVER AGAIN WISHING YOU

807
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS

850
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
ALREADY AWAKE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SENTIMENT

851
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000

WE NEED TO MAKE THE VOICE OF THE

871
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
AFTER THE SHOOTING OF GIFFORD,

872
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
THERE WAS A POLL CONDUCTED.

873
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
49% SAID IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO

PARTISAN POLITICAL DEBATE.

922
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
OF THE CONVERSATION IS

923
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000

HEALTH ISSUE AND THE GUN

928
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
VIOLENCE ISSUE, WHICH MEANS

929
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN

930
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
ADJUDICTED, DANGEROUSLY MENTALLY

931
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
ILL, CAN BUY A GUN, NO QUESTIONS

932
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
ASKED.
IF WE CAN JUST FRAME THE

933
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
CONVERSATION AROUND THINGS LIKE

934
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
THAT THAT CAN MAKE ALL OF THAT

935
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
BETTER, LIKE THE PRESIDENT SAID

936
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
LAST NIGHT WE CAN SOLVE THAT

937
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
PROBLEM.

938
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
KATIE: LET'S TALK ABOUT MENTAL

939
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
HEALTH.

940
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
ARE WE READY TO HAVE A REAL

941
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW MENTAL

942
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
HEALTH IS VIEWED AND TREATED IN

943
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
THIS COUNTRY, HAROLD?

944
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
>> I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY TIME.

945
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
HOW MANY MORE SHOOTINGS DO YOU

946
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
HAVE TO HAVE?

947
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
THE AMAZING PARTS ARE SHOOTINGS

948
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
ARE RARE, THE REAL LOSSES ARE

949
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
EVERY DAY.

950
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
KIDS, 15 MILLION OF THEM IN THE

951
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
UNITED STATES WHO HAVE A

952
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER ARE MORE AT

953
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
RISK FOR ACADEMIC FAILURE, MORE

954
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
AT RISK FOR SOCIAL ISOLATION,

955
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
SUBSTANCE ABUSE, SCHOOL DROP

956
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
OUT, UNEMPLOYMENT AND

957
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
INTERACTIONS WITH THE LAW.

958
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
YET IT'S EASIER FOR US TO TALK

959
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
ABOUT CANCER OR DIABETES THAN TO

960
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT HAPPEN

961
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
FROM YOUR NECK UP.

962
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
KATIE: WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT,

963
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
BUT ALSO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

964
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
TREAT IT.

965
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
FUNDING HAS BEEN CUT SO

966
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST FEW

967
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
YEARS.
>> TREMENDOUSLY, ACROSS THE

968
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
NATION.
MENTAL HEALTH BUDGETS HAVE BEEN

969
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
SLASHED.

970
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
WITHOUT MONEY FOR RESEARCH,

971
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
WITHOUT MONEY FOR PROPER

972
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
FACILITIES, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

973
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
WITHOUT MONEY FOR INNOVATIVE

974
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
CARE, BEING ABLE TO SEE, THERE'S

975
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
7,500 CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST, THE

976
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
MATH DOESN'T WORK.

977
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
YOU CAN'T SEE A DOCTOR TUESDAYS

978
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
AT 4:00.

979
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
FOR SOME OF THESE KIDS THEY NEED

980
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
A VERY INNOVATIVE PROGRAM,

981
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
YOU'RE INCLUDING PARENTS, AND

982
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
YOU'RE MORE FLEXIBLE.

983
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
YOU'RE ABLE TO SEE THEM SEVEN

984
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
DAYS A WEEK OR IN THE EVENINGS.

985
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
UNTIL WE HAVE A NATIONAL

986
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
CONVERSATION THAT MENTAL ILLNESS

987
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
IS EQUAL TO PHYSICAL ILLNESS,

988
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
THESE KINDS OF EPISODES, AND

989
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
MORE IMPORTANTLY THE KIND OF

990
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
EPISODES OF HIGH SCHOOL DROP

991
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
OUTS AND CAR CRASHES AND TEEN

992
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
PREGNANCIES, AND SUICIDE, WHICH

993
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR

994
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
WITH PSYCHIATRIC ILL KIDS THAN

995
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
HOMICIDE.

996
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
KATIE: WE BARELY SCRATCHED THE

997
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
SURFACE, TWO SUCH CRITICALLY

998
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
IMPORTANT ISSUES AND I HOPE

999
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
YOU'LL COME BACK WHEN WE CAN

1000
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
HAVE AN HOUR LONG CONVERSATION

1001
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
ABOUT EACH OF THEM, BECAUSE

1002
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
THEY'RE THAT IMPORTANT.

1003
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH, DAN AND

1004
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
HAROLD.
APPRECIATE IT.

1005
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
UP NEXT, JOEL OSTEEN ON HEALING

1006
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
A COMMUNITY AND AN ENTIRE

1007
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
NATION.

1008
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
KATIE: I'D LIKE TO SHARE A PHOTO

1009
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
WITH ALL OF YOU THAT WAS GIVEN

1010
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
TO ME BY SOMEONE WHO WORKS AT

1011
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
ST. ROSE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN

1012
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1013
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
A PHOTO HE TOOK AT 9:30 A.M. ON

1014
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
FRIDAY MORNING.

1015
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
JOEL OSTEEN IS THE PASTOR OF THE

1016
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
LARGEST CONGREGATION IN THIS

1017
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
COUNTRY IN HOUSTON, TEXAS.

1018
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
AND JOEL, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

1019
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
REALLY STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND

1020
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
WHAT HAPPENED ON FRIDAY MORNING

1021
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
AT THAT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH

1022
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
ALL THOSE PRECIOUS KIDS.

1023
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
AND LAST NIGHT, ONE OF THE DAD'S

1024
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
SAID TO ME, HOW CAN A MERCIFUL

1025
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
GOD ALLOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO

1026
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
HAPPEN.

1027
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
AND I SAID I'M GOING TO BE

1028
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
TALKING TO JOEL OSTEEN TOMORROW

1029
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
AND I'M GOING TO ASK HIM THAT

1030
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
QUESTION.

1031
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
>> YOU KNOW, KATIE, WE DON'T

1032
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT

1033
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
ALL.

1034
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I THINK MY TAKE ON IT IS THAT

1035
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
GOD HAS GIVEN US ALL OUR OWN

1036
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
FREE WILL.

1037
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
HE DIDN'T MAKE US ROBOTS, HE

1038
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
GAVE US THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE

1039
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
AND UNFORTUNATELY SOME PEOPLE

1040
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
CHOOSE EVIL.
I STILL BELIEVE THAT GOD IS GOOD

1041
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
AND THAT HE IS FOR US, BUT GOD

1042
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
DOESN'T MAKE US DO WHAT'S RIGHT

1043
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN A FALLEN

1044
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
WORLD, IT'S NOT PERFECT.

1045
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
KATIE: IF YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

1046
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
TO COUNSEL SOME OF THE PARENTS,

1047
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I SPOKE TO SOME OF THEM LAST

1048
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
NIGHT AND THEIR GRIEF IS JUST SO

1049
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
ALL-CONSUMING, AS OF COURSE ALL

1050
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
OF US CAN UNDERSTAND.

1051
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM?

1052
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
HOW WOULD YOU HELP THEM GET

1053
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
THROUGH THIS EXCRUCIATINGLY

1054
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
DIFFICULT TIME?
>> WELL, OUR HEARTS BREAK WITH

1055
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
THEIR HEARTS.

1056
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
SOMETIMES WORDS AREN'T GOOD

1057
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
ENOUGH, YOU KNOW.

1058
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
JESUS SAID YOU WEEP WITH THOSE

1059
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
THAT WEEP AND MOURN WITH THOSE

1060
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
THAT MOURN.
I WOULD TELL THEM, NOT BRINGING

1061
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
ALL THE ANSWERS BUT GOD HAS THEM

1062
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
IN THE PALM OF THEIR HAND.

1063
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
LIKE THOSE STORIES WE WERE

1064
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
WATCHING EARLIER TODAY ON YOUR

1065
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
PROGRAM, IT'S AMAZING HOW WHEN

1066
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
YOU TURN TO YOUR FAITH, GOD WILL

1067
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
GIVE YOU A STRENGTH THAT ONLY HE

1068
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
CAN GIVE YOU.

1069
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
A COUPLE OF THEM TALKING ABOUT

1070
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
HOW THEY WEREN'T ANGRY, THEY

1071
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
WEREN'T MAD AT THE OTHER PERSON,

1072
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
AND I BELIEVE IT COMES IN WAVES

1073
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
OF GRIEF, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

1074
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
GOD WILL GIVE YOU WAVES OF HIS

1075
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
GRACE TO MAKE IT THROUGH THAT

1076
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
TIME.
SO I JUST SAY TO BE STRONG, TAKE

1077
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
IT A DAY AT A TIME, LIKE THAT

1078
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
ONE LADY SAID.

1079
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
SHE WAS TAKING IT AT A MINUTE A

1080
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
TIME.

1081
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
YOU MAY LOOK UP AND SAY I CAN'T

1082
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
DO THIS FOR SIX MONTHS, I CAN'T

1083
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
LIVE WITHOUT MY CHILD.

1084
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
GOD DOESN'T ASK YOU TO DO THAT.

1085
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
CAN YOU DO IT FOR FIVE MORE

1086
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
MINUTES.
JUST TAKE IT ONE MINUTE AT A

1087
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
TIME.

1088
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
KATIE: HOW DO WE ALL EXPLAIN

1089
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO OUR

1090
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
CHILDREN?

1091
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
THAT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE WERE

1092
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
ASKING EACH OTHER ALL WEEKEND.

1093
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
HOW DO YOU TALK TO KIDS ABOUT

1094
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
THIS WITHOUT TERRIFYING THEM AND

1095
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
FEELING SO UNSAFE IN THE WORLD?

1096
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
>> IT'S DIFFICULT.

1097
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I DO THINK, OBVIOUSLY DEPENDING

1098
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
ON WHAT AGE THEY ARE, YOU TALK

1099
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
TO THEM IN THE APPROPRIATE WAY,

1100
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU DO IT OUT

1101
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
OF FEAR AND SAY OH, WE'RE IN

1102
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
THIS TERRIBLE WORLD.

1103
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I THINK YOU STILL HAVE TO DO IT

1104
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
FROM A PLACE OF GOD'S IN CONTROL

1105
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
OF YOUR LIFE, AND THERE ARE EVIL

1106
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
PEOPLE OUT THERE, BUT YOU KNOW

1107
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
CHOOSE TO BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS

1108
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
GOOD THINGS IN STORE FOR YOU,

1109
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
AND NOT APPROACH IT FROM A

1110
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
FEAR-BASED THING WHERE YOU GO

1111
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
OUT AND JUST ALWAYS BE WATCHING

1112
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
FOR SOMETHING.

1113
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT

1114
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
WAY.
KATIE: AND HOW DO WE CHANGE SORT

1115
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
OF THE TENOR OF OUR COUNTRY?

1116
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
IT SEEMS TO ME, THIS IS MY

1117
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
PERSONAL OPINION, THAT OBVIOUSLY

1118
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
THERE'S SO MUCH GOOD IN OUR

1119
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
COUNTRY, AND YOU SEE IT EVERY

1120
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
DAY, AND YET THERE SEEMS TO BE

1121
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
SUCH A STRONG UNDERCURRENT OF

1122
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
ANGER AND RAGE, AND

1123
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
DEVICIVENESS.

1124
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO

1125
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
FOSTER A BETTER ATMOSPHERE WHERE

1126
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
PEOPLE DO SUPPORT AND CARE FOR

1127
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
EACH OTHER AND AREN'T SO ANGRY

1128
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
AND LASHING OUT ALL THE TIME?

1129
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
>> I KNOW.

1130
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
WE SEE IT AS WELL.

1131
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I THINK IT STARTS, KATIE, WITH

1132
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
EACH ONE OF US BEING AN EXAMPLE

1133
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
AND HOW CAN WE BE GOOD, DO

1134
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
SOMETHING GOOD FOR SOMEBODY

1135
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
EVERY DAY.

1136
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST I THINK

1137
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
THERE ARE AS WELL FORCES, I CALL

1138
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
THEM FORCES OF DARKNESS, THERE

1139
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
ARE FORCES THAT TRY TO PULL

1140
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
PEOPLE DOWN INTO ANGER AND

1141
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
DECEPTION AND THEY HEAR VOICES

1142
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

1143
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO

1144
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
FIGHT TO KEEP YOUR MIND ON THE

1145
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
RIGHT THING, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU

1146
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
PUT IN YOURSELF SO THAT YOU KNOW

1147
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
YOU DON'T GIVE OVER TO SOME OF

1148
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
THESE TERRIBLE THINGS WE'VE

1149
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
SEEN, WHICH ARE UNIMAGINABLE.

1150
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
KATIE: DO YOU TALK TO YOUR CON

1151
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
GREFATION WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS

1152
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
HAPPEN AND HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN

1153
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
THEM?
>> YEAH, THERE'S NO GOOD

1154
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
EXPLANATION, EXCEPT TO BELIEVE

1155
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
GOD'S IN CONTROL, EVEN WHEN IT

1156
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
LOOKS LIKE GOD'S OUT OF CONTROL.

1157
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
EVEN IN THAT PICTURE, THAT'S GOD

1158
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000

THIS, BUT STILL LOSING FAMILY

1164

NOTHING CAN SNATCH YOU OUT OF MY

1170

1171
