00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'M HEARTBROKEN.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
>> BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
TAKEN FROM THEM.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
PEOPLE'S SPOUSES.

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
>> I HAVE TO COMMEND THE STAFF

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000

IT WAS MOST OBVIOUS TODAY.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
MOST OBVIOUS TODAY WHAT THEY

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
REALLY ARE ABOUT AS TEACHERS.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
TO ALL OF THEM, I SAY THANKS ON

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
MORE GUN CONTROL.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
MANY SAY IT DEMANDS TOUGHER

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
LEGISLATION IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
VISIBLY SHAKEN PRESIDENT OBAMA

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
FULFILL THEIR DREAMS.

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
NATION WOULD HAVE BEEN FEELING

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
AND TONIGHT POLICE HAVE

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
IDENTIFIED THE KILLER AS ADAM

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
LANZA.

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
THIS IS HIS BROTHER RYAN LANZA

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
BEING TAKEN INTO QUESTIONING.

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
MUCH MORE ON THE SHOOTER AHEAD.

SUSAN CANDIOTTI HAS NEW DETAILS

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
FROM OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
A DESPERATE DAY FOR THE SCHOOL

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
AND THE FAMILIES OF THE POOR

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
CHILDREN AND FOR AMERICA.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE PERSON

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
WHO PERPETRATED THE HIDEOUS

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
CRIME?
>> IT IS SO HEART BREAKING.

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
WE ARE LEARNING HE IS

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA.

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
WE KNOW ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON WHEN HE

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
CAME TO THE SCHOOL THIS DAY, HE

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
WAS WEARING WHAT IS DESCRIBED TO

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
ME AS BLACK BATTLE FATIGUES AND

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
A MILITARY VEST.

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
HE CAME ARMED WITH THREE

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
WEAPONS.
TWO OF THEM HAND GUNS.

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
ONE AS A GLOCK AND ANOTHER AS A

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
SIG SAUER AND A THIRD POLICE

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
FOUND IN THE VEHICLE.

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
THE TWO WEAPONS WERE FOUND ON

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
HIM IN THE SCHOOL.

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
THE THIRD WAS FOUND, THE BUSH

94
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
MASTER WHICH IS A SEMI AUTOMATIC

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
WAS FOUND IN A CAR OUTSIDE THE

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
SCHOOL.
WHAT LED HIM TO THIS?

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
WE DON'T KNOW.

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
WE DO KNOW THIS.

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
POLICE HAVE QUESTIONED BOTH HIS

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
BROTHER AND HIS FATHER.

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
HIS BROTHER WAS TAKEN INTO

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
CUSTODY FOR QUESTIONING ONLY.

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
HE IS NOT BEING CALLED A

104
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
SUSPECT.

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
FROM HIS APARTMENT IN HOBOKEN,

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
NEW JERSEY.

107
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
WE UNDERSTAND THE FATHER WAS

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
ALSO QUESTIONED BY AUTHORITIES

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
HERE IN THE NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
AREA.

111
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
THE FATHER IS DIVORCED FROM

112
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
NANCY LANZA.
SHE IS THE MOTHER OF THE TWO WHO

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
IS A SCHOOL TEACHER AND COUNTED

114
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
AMONG THE DEAD.

115
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
HER DD WAS FOUND IN A RESIDENCE

116
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
HERE IN THE NEWTOWN AREA AS

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
WELL.

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, PIERS, THE

119
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
WEAPONS ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES
WERE OWNED BY THE MOTHER, NANCY

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
LANZA IN THIS CASE.

121
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
NOT BY THE SHOOTER.

122
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
STILL TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER A

123
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
MOTIVE.

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THERE SIGNS WE ARE HEARING FOR
OUR SOURCES THAT THE SHOOTER MAY

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
HAVE SUFFERED FROM SOME KIND OF

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

127
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
DID HE LEAVE NOTES BEHIND?

128
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
DID HE TELL ANYONE WHAT HE WAS

129
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
PLANNING TO DO?

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
AMONG THE MANY QUESTIONS THAT WE

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
ALL HAVE TONIGHT.

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED.

133
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I WANT TO TURN TO ASHLEIGH

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
BANFIELD.
I WAS WATCHING WHEN YOU WERE

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
SPEAKING TO WOLF BLITZER AND YOU
BECAME VERY EMOTIONAL.

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
TWO OF YOUR CHILDREN WENT TO

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
SCHOOL IN CONNECTICUT AND YOU

138
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
WERE NOT SURE WHAT WAS HAPPENING

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
WITH THEM.

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
THEY WERE OKAY, BUT THIS IS

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
EVERY PARENT'S NIGHTMARE.

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
BODIES OF STILL LYING THERE ON

144
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
WHAT THE POLICE ARE CALLING THE
CRIME SCENE OF THE SCHOOL.

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
THE PARENTS CAN'T EVEN SEE THEM.

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
IT'S AN UNIMAGINABLE HORROR.

147
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
>> THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO PUT

148
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
IT.

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
UNIMAGINABLE HORROR AND AN EVIL

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
VISITED UPON THE COMMUNITY

151
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNOR OF

152
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
CONNECTICUT WHO SPOKE HERE

153
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
EARLIER.
ANOTHER DETAIL FOR YOU THAT I

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
WANT TO SHARE ABOUT HOW SOME OF

155
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
THESE PARENTS LEARNED THEY

156
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
WOULDN'T BE SEEING THEIR

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
CHILDREN AGAIN.

158
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I THINK YOU ALREADY KNOW THE

159
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
DETAIL THAT MANY OF THE CHILDREN

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
WERE RUSHED OUT OF THE SCHOOL.

161
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
OUT OF THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
BY THE POLICE AND TEACHERS AND

163
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
RACED ON FOOT TO A NEARBY FIRE

164
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
STATION WHICH BECAME THE STAGING

165
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
AREA.
THEY WERE ROBO CALLS THAT WENT

166
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
OUT.
WE HEARD THE ROBOCALLS SAYING

167
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
PARENTS OF THE SANDY HOOK

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
STUDENTS, COME TO THIS FIRE

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
STATION TO BE REUNITED WITH YOUR

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
CHILDREN.
THROUGHOUT THE DAY THERE WAS ONE

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
AREA WITHIN THAT FIRE STATION

172
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
WHERE THE CHILDREN WERE KEPT AND

173
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
THEY WERE SHOWN MOVIES UNTIL

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
THEIR PARENTS COULD COME AND

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
FIND THEM.
THERE WAS ANOTHER AREA WHERE A

176
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
NUMBER OF THE PARENTS WERE

177
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
MILLING ABOUT, WAITING FOR

178
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
STUDENTS TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE

179
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
FIRE STATION.

180
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE IT WAS A CHAOTIC

181
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
SCENE FOR SOMETIME.

182
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
SLOWLY BUT SURELY OVER THE

183
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
COURSE OF THE DAY PARENTS ARRIVE

184
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
AND CHILDREN WERE TAKEN AWAY AND

185
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
PARENTS CONTINUED TO WAIT AND

186
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
OTHER CHILDREN DIDN'T ARRIVE AND

187
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
ULTIMATELY THERE WAS A MOMENT

188
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
WHERE THEY HAD TO TELL THE

189

WAITING PARENTS THERE WILL BE NO

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000

191
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'M TOLD FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS

192
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
INSIDE THAT AREA IN A ROOM

193
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
ADJACENT THAT AT THE MOMENT THE

194
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
PARENTS WERE TOLD THERE WOULD BE

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
NO MORE CHILDREN COMING THERE

196
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
WERE WAILS THAT WERE RELEASED.

197
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
THE PERSON WHO TOLD ME THIS SHE

198
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
SAID SHE COMPLETELY BROKE DOWN.

199
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
THERE WAS A NURSE ON HAND WHO

200
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
VOLUNTEERED HAVING WORKED TWO

201
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
DECADES IN THE BUSINESS.

202
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
HER BROTHER TELLING ME THAT SHE

203
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
JUST WANTED TO BE THERE AND HELP

204
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
IN ANY WAY SHE COULD AS A GRIEF

205
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
COUNSELLOR AND WAS PRESENT AT

206
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
THAT TIME AS WELL.

207
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
A HORRIFYING MOMENT IF YOU CAN

208
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
IMAGINE BEING THOSE PARENT WHO

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
IS WAITED AND WAITED AND WAITED

210
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
LIKE YOU SAID, THEY KNOW THE

212
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
BODIES OF THEIR CHILDREN ARE

213
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
STILL IN THAT SCHOOL TONIGHT.

214
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
>> IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE ANYTHING

215
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
WORSE IN THE WORLD.

216
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
THANK YOU FOR NOW.

217
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.

220
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000

DESCRIPTION, BEYOND ANY

222
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
UNDERSTANDING.

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
HOW IS THE COMMUNITY DEALING

224
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000

>> WELL, OBVIOUSLY IT'S BEEN A

227
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
HORRIFIC DAY IN THE GREATER

DANBURY AREA AND PARTICULARLY

229
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THE TOWN OF NEWTOWN.

230
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
OUR HEART GOES OUT TO THE

231
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
INDIVIDUALS WHO LOST LOVED ONES

232
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
TODAY AND OBVIOUSLY THE CHILDREN

233
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
AND THE STAFF AND EVERYBODY

234
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
ELSE.

235
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLY

236
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
DIFFICULT DAY.

237
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
THE FIRST STAFF HAVE WORKED

238
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
HARD.

239
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
SHE IS REALLY DOING WHAT NEEDS

240
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
TO BE DONE.

241
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS WERE

242
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
TREMENDOUS AND THE STAFF HAVE
BEEN HEROIC IN TERMS OF THEIR

243
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
APPROACH TO THIS.

244
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE INTERNATIONAL

245
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
TRAGEDY AND CRISIS.

246
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNEW

247
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
THE PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL WHO

248
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
ALSO WAS KILLED.

249
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
I HAD THE HONOR OF WORKING IN

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THE SAME SCHOOL SYSTEM AND VERY

251
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
SHE WAS A TEACHER IN THE SCHOOL

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
SYSTEM AND ELEVATED UP THROUGH

255
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000

DEDICATED EDUCATOR.

259
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000

WITH FOLKS WHO ARE DISABLED.

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
ONCE WE UNDERSTAND THIS HORRIFIC

288
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
TRAGEDY THAT OCCURRED.

289
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
THAT CONVERSATION WILL BE

290
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
LIKE IN THE SCHOOL.

296
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
SOFIA WAS THERE AND JUST 8 YEARS

297
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
OLD.
SHE JOINS ME WITH HER BROTHER,

IF I MAY START WITH YOU, BRENDA.

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
THIS IS EVERY MOTHER'S

302
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
NIGHTMARE.

303
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
WHEN WAS THE FIRST YOU HEARD

304
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
ABOUT THIS AND HOW DID YOU HEAR?

305
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
>> I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE

306
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
SCHOOL SYSTEM FROM THE

307
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
SUPERINTENDENT SAYING THAT THERE

308
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
WAS A SHOOTING IN NEWTOWN, BUT

309
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
DIDN'T SAY IT WAS A SCHOOL.

310
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THAT THE SCHOOLS WERE ON

311
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
LOCKDOWN.
I WASN'T TOO CONCERNED BECAUSE I

312
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT HAPPENED.

313
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I RECEIVED A TEXT ON MY PHONE

314
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
FROM A NEWS ORGANIZATION AND

315
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
THEY SAID THAT SANDY HOOK SCHOOL

316
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
HAD A SHOOTING.

317
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I GOT IN MY CAR AND I WENT OVER

318
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
TO THE SCHOOL AND THERE WERE

319
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
ALREADY STATE POLICE AND THE

320
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
FIRE AND NEWTOWN POLICE.

321
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
>> WHEN YOU GOT THERE, OBVIOUSLY

322
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
SCENES OF COMPLETE CHAOS, HOW

323
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
QUICKLY WAS IT THAT YOU REALIZED

324
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
YOUR DAUGHTER WAS SAFE?

325
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
>> OKAY.

326
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
WHEN I GOT THERE, THERE WAS

327
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
COMPLETE CHAOS, BUT I DID SEE

328
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
MOMS AND A NEIGHBOR AND ASKED

329
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
THEM WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY SAID

330
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
THEY DIDN'T KNOW.
THAT THERE WAS A SHOOTING AND I

331
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
SAW A NEIGHBOR LIKE I SAID AND

332
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
HE SAID THEY CARRIED OUT A

333
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
LITTLE BILL E GIRL AND SHE

334
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS DEAD.

335
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
INSTANTLY I PANICKED BECAUSE OF

336
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
MY BABY HERE, BUT THANKFULLY NO

337
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
SOONER HE SAID THAT I LOOKED

338
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
TOWARDS THE KIDS BEING BROUGHT

339
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
FROM THE SCHOOL TO THE FIREHOUSE

340
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
AND I SAW HER CLASS AND I RAN UP

341
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
AND I SAID WHERE IS SOFIA AND

342
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
THEY SAID SHE IS OKAY.

343
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
SHE'S COMING.
I SAW HER WITH HER TEACHER AND

344
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
WE ALL WERE TAKEN INTO THE

345
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
FIREHOUSE AND KEPT SO THEY COULD

346
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
DO A ROLL CALL AND MAKE SURE ALL

347
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
THE STUDENTS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR.

348
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
>> SOFIA, IT'S BEEN A TERRIFYING

349
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
DAY FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.

350
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS

351
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
HAPPENING.
WERE YOU AWARE SOMEBODY WAS

352
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
FIRING A GUN IN THE SCHOOL?

353
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
PRAR ARE CAN YOU HEAR?

354
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
>> NOT REALLY.

355
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
>> SHE CAN'T REALLY HEAR.

356
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
SHE TOLD ME THAT THEY HEARD POPS

357
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
IN THE HALL WAY.

358
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
THE TEACHER TOLD ME ALSO,

359
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
COURTNEY MARTIN IS MY HERO, SHE

360
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
LOCKED THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY AND

361
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
BROUGHT ALL THE KIDS TO A CORNER

362
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
OF THE ROOM WHERE THEY STAYED

363
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
THERE.
THEY WERE SCARED AND SHAKEN, BUT

364
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING

365
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
ON UNTIL LATER WHEN THEY WERE

366
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
BROUGHT INTO THE FIREHOUSE.

367
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
POLICE CAME AND KNOCKED ON THE

368
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
DOOR AND SAID IT'S OKAY, YOU CAN

369
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
COME OUT.

370
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
THEY GUIDED THEM TO THE BACK OF

371
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
THE SCHO AND THEY WALKED OVER

372
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
TO THE FIREHOUSE.

373
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
THAT'S WHERE I CAUGHT UP WITH

374
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
SOFIA.
>> HOW IS SOFIA NOW.

375
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A TRAUMATIC

376
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
EXPERIENCE FOR ALL THE CHILDREN

377
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
WHO SURVIVED THIS.

378
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
>> I THINK SHE IS NUMB RIGHT

379
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
NOW.

380
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
SHE IS A PRETTY BRIGHT KID AND

381
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
SHE HAS A BIG SUPPORT STAFF AT

382
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
HOME AND WE LOVE HER VERY MUCH

383
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
AND SHE WILL BE FINE.

384
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
WE ARE DEVASTATED FOR THE REST

385
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
OF THE FAMILIES.

386
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHO WAS HURT.

387
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I DO KNOW MY CLOSE FRIENDS'S

388
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
CHILDREN ARE OKAY, BUT WE DON'T

389
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
KNOW WHO THE CHILDREN WERE.

390
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF SHE CAN HEAR

391
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
ME OR NOT, BUT I WONDERED IF SHE

392
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
WANTED TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT

393
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER TODAY.

394
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
>> DO YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING,

395
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
HONEY?
ARE YOU SURE?

396
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
>> SHE TOO COLD NOW.

397
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
>> SHE SHOULD PROBABLY GO HOME

398
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
WITH HER MOM.

399
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
IT'S BEEN A TERRIFYING DAY FOR

400
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
EVERYBODY INVOLVED.

401
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU WERE

402
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
ABLE TO SEE YOUR DAUGHTER.

403
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
OBVIOUSLY YOUR HEART MUST GO OUT

404
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
TO THE POOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE

405
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEE THEIR POOR
CHILDREN AGAIN.

406
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
>> IT'S A SMALL COMMUNITY AND

407
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
IT'S A CLOSE-KNIT SCHOOL AND

408
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
DEVASTATING.

409
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I WILL BE HERE FOR ANYBODY AND

410
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
OUR PRAYERS GO OUT TO ALL THE

411
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
FAMILIES.

412
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED.

413
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
>> I'M JUST THE LUCKIEST LADY

414
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
RIGHT NOW.

415
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED

416
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
FOR JOINING ME.

417
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I APPRECIATE IT.

418
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
>> THANK YOU.

419
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
>> VERY LUCKY INDEED.

420
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
THE GUNMAN IS ADAM LANZA AND

421
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
JOINING ME IS LANZA'S FORMER

422
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
CLASSMATE, ALEX ISRAEL.

423
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
YOU KNEW THIS CHARACTER.

424
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
IS THIS SOMETHING YOU COULD HAVE

425
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
PREDICTED HE WOULD ONE DAY FLIP

426
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
AND DO SOMETHING AS MONSTEROUS

427
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
AS THIS?

428
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN EVER

429
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
PREDICT SOMETHING LIKE THAT

430
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
WOULD HAPPEN.

431
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
YOU NEVER THINK IT'S GOING TO

432
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
HAPPEN TO YOUR SCHOOL AND WHERE

433
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
YOU LIVED YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

434
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD PREDICT

435
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
IT.
THERE WAS SOMETHING OFF ABOUT

436
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
HIM.
I KNEW HIM CLOSELY WHEN WE WERE

437
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
VERY YOUNG IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

438
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
TOGETHER.

439
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
HE WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT

440
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
DIFFERENT.

441
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
HE MOSTLY STUCK TO HIMSELF.

442
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SAY YOU

443
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
CAN PREDICT THIS.

444
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
>> HE WAS BY ALL ACCOUNTS A

445
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
PRETTY CLEVER YOUNG MAN, ALMOST

446
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
A GENIUS IN MATH.
ME ABOUT THAT SIDE OF HIM.

447
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
>> I WAS NEVER IN ANY OF HIS

448
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
CLASSES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

449
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
BUT YEAH, YOU COULD DEFINITELY

450
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
TELL HE WAS I WOULD SAY A

451
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
GENIUS.
THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING

452
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
THERE THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT

453
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
ABOVE THE REST OF US.

454
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
>> DID HE HAVE FRIENDS?

455
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
WAS HE SOCIABLE?

456
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
>> I ALWAYS SAW HIM ALONE WHEN

457
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
HE WAS WALKING THROUGH THE

458
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
SCHOOL OR SITTING AT THE TABLE,

459
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
SITTING ON THE BUS.

460
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'M SURE HE HAD A FEW MAYBE

461
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
CLOSE FRIENDS THROUGH SCHOOL OR

462
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
THROUGH HIS CLASSES.

463
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
MOST OF THE TIME I SAW HIM, HE

464
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
WAS ALONE.

465
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
>> HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE HIS

466
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
PERSONALITY?

467
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
>> HE WAS REALLY QUIET.

468
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
HE KEPT TO HIMSELF.

469
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
HE WAS A LITTLE FIDGETY.

470
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
A LITTLE UNEASY SOMETIMES IF YOU

471
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
WERE TO LOOK AT HIM.

472
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I THINK HE WAS JUST SOCIALLY NOT

473
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
REALLY INTO GOING OUT THERE AND

474
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
MAKING AS MANY FRIENDS AS

475
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
EVERYONE WAS DOING IN ELEMENTARY

476
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL.

477
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
HE PREFERRED TO STAY TO HIMSELF.

478
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
>> DID YOU KNOW HIS FAMILY, HIS

479
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
MOTHER IN PARTICULAR?

480
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
>> I KNEW HER BECAUSE WE LIVED

481
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

482
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I KNEW HER THROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD

483
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
EVENTS.
MY MOM KNEW HER.

484
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
SHE WAS A VERY NICE WOMAN.

485
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I DIDN'T KNOW HER PERSONALLY,

486
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
BUT FROM WHAT I REMEMBER, SHE

487
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
WAS A NICE WOMAN.

488
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
>> HIS PARENTS GOT DIVORCED.

489
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
WERE YOU AWARE OF THAT HAVING A

490
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
BIG IMPACT ON HIM?

491
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
>> I DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY GOT

492
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
DIVORCED THE.

493
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I HAVE KNOWN HIM SINCE ABOUT

494
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
FIRST GRADE AND HE HAS ALWAYS

495
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
BEEN THE WAY I DESCRIBED HIM.

496
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
RESERVED AND QUIET.

497
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE DIVORCE

498
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT OR

499
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
WHEN THEY DIVORCED.

500
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THAT OR

501
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
MADE IT WORSE AS HE GOT OLDER

502
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
AND CAME MORE RESERVED.

503
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT AFFECTED

504
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
IT.

505
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
>> WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU HEARD

506
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
AND WHAT WAS YOUR IMMEDIATE

507
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
REACTION WHEN YOU DISCOVERED IT

508
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
WAS THIS PERSON YOU KNEW?

509
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
>> IT WAS DEVASTATING.

510
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'M IN LONDON NOW STUDYING HERE

511
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
FOR THE SEMESTER AND COMING HOME
ON THURSDAY TO THIS.

512
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I FOUND OUT FIRST EARLY THIS

513
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
MORNING I GUESS PROBABLY WHEN IT

514
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
BROKE AT HOME.

515
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
IT WAS AROUND 2:00 AND THE FIRST

516
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
INFORMATION OF IT, IT'S

517
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
DEVASTATING IN A TOWN WHERE YOU

518
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
HAVE KNOWN UP.

519
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I FELT SAFE MY WHOLE LIFE AND I

520
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
WAS RAISED IN THAT ELEMENTARY

521
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL SYSTEM

522
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
THERE AND FINDING OUT IT WAS

523
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
SOMEONE I KNEW WHO HAD DONE ALL

524
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
OF THIS IS JUST UPSETTING.

525
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WOULD

526
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
EVER HAPPEN.

527
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
>> THE COMMUNITY AROUND NEWTOWN,

528
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT?

529
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
IT'S A KIND OF QUIET PLACE AND

530
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
THIS STUFF NEVER HAPPENS.

531
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
THEY DON'T GET MANY SHOOTINGS

532
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
AND GUN MURDERS.

533
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL KIND OF

534
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
PLACE IN THAT SENSE.

535
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
>> NO.
I MEAN IT'S A PRETTY BIG TOWN

536
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
SPACE-WISE.

537
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
WE SPAN OVER A PRETTY VAST ARRAY

538
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
OF LAND, BUT IT'S REALLY

539
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
CLOSE-KNIT IN THAT EVERYONE

540
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
KNOWS EACH OTHER AND IS CLOSE

541
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
WITH EACH OTHER AND THE SCHOOL

542
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
SYSTEMS ARE CLOSE.
YOU GROW UP WITH THESE PEOPLE

543
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
AND GO TO SCHOOL WITH THEM.

544
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
EVERYONE CAME TOGETHER I THINK

545
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
THROUGH THIS.

546
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
THEY ARE REALLY SUPPORTING EACH

547
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
OTHER QUITE WELL.

548
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
THAT'S ONE GOOD THING TO COME

549
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
OUT OF IT IF ANYTHING.

550
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
>> WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU

551
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
SPOKE TO ADAM LANZA?

552
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
>> PROBABLY MIDDLE SCHOOL.

553
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONNECTION

554
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
WITH HIM IN HIGH SCHOOL.

555
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
MIDDLE SCHOOL PROBABLY.

556
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
THE LAST TIME I SAID A WORD TO

557
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
HIM.

00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
OF THEIR NORMAL DEVELOPMENT.

726
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
SOME OF THEM WILL FIGURE OUT

727
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
YEARS LATER WHAT ACTUALLY

728
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
HAPPENED.

729
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
SOME ARE GOING TO DO RELATIVELY

730
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
WELL.

731
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
THEY WILL BE SADDER AND WISER IN

732
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
A WAY.

733
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WHAT

734
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I SEE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

735
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
THAT COMMUNITY IS COMING

736
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
TOGETHER.
PEOPLE ARE LOVING EACH OTHER.

737
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS COME TO REMIND

738
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
US THAT WE ARE A NATION WHO

739
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
CARES AND HE CAME AS A FATHER.

740
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I AM A FATHER AND A GRANDFATHER.

741
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I HAVE CALLED MY CHILDREN AND I

742
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY ARE DOING

743
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

744
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
AS WE COME TOGETHER, WE DO THE

745
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
BEST THAT WE CAN AT A SAD TIME

746
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
LIKE THIS.

747
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
>> I SUPPOSE THE BIG QUESTION IS

748
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
WHY WOULD THIS SHOOTER DO WHAT

749
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
HE DID?

750
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
GO TO A CLASSROOM AND MURDER SO

751
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
MANY YOUNG CHILDREN OF SUCH A

752
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
YOUNG TENDER AGE, POSSIBLY THE

753
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
CLASSROOM THAT HIS MOTHER WAS

754
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
ALREADY KILLED AT THEIR HOME.

755
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
CAN YOU TRY TO PIECE FROM YOUR

756
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
EXPERIENCE THE THOUGHT PROCESS

757
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
HERE?
WHY HE WOULD THEN HAVING KILLED

758
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
HIS MOTHER GO TO THE SCHOOL AND

759
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
DO WHAT HE DID?

760
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
>> I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL

761
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
AND I HAVEN'T DIAGNOSED OR

762
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
ASSESSED HIM.

763
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ARE

764
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
NOT MORE VIOLENT.

765
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

766
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
SIMPLY NOT THE DATA WE HAVE.

767
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
IF INDEED MENTAL ILLNESS IS A

768
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
PART OF THIS, THERE IS A

769
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
PARTICULAR PATH THAT NEEDS TO BE

770
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
LOOKED AT.

771
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
ARE THEY DEPRESSED AND

772
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
SUICIDALLY DEPRESSED.

773
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
HIS ROOMMATE ALEX ISRAEL SAID HE

774
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
PREFERRED TO STAY ALONE.

775
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
A SYMPTOM OF ASPERGER'S AND

776
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
REPORT THAT CAME OUT WHICH MAY

777
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
OR MAY NOT BE TRUE, THERE IS A

778
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
CAPACITY FOR EMPATHY AND SOCIAL

779
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
CONNECTION THAT LEAVES THE

780
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
PERSON SUFFERING FOR THIS

781
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
CONDITION.
THEY ARE PRONE TO SERIOUS

782
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY.

783
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
IF THEY ARE SUICIDALLY

784
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
DEPRESSED, WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH.

785
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO IN

786
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
AGREEING TO COME HERE IS TO ASK

787
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
PEOPLE TO DON'T RUSH TO JUDGMENT

788
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
ABOUT WHO THIS YOUNG MAN IS.

789
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
IF IT WAS MENTAL ILLNESS THAT

790
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
PLAYED A ROLE, IT'S AN

791
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO BETTER.

792
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
>> THERE IS A SCHOOL THAT YOU

793
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
SHOULDN'T GIVE HIM ATTENTION AND

794
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
NAME HIM AND SO ON BECAUSE IT

795
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
BRINGS ATTENTION TO HIM.

796
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
HE'S DEAD SO HE WON'T BE ABLE TO

797
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
BASK IN THE APPALLING GLORY OF

798
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
WHAT HE DID, BUT SECONDLY THESE

799
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
YOUNG MEN.

800
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
>> YOU ARE MAKING THAT

801
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
ASSUMPTION.
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

802
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I SPEND MANY HOURS WITH MEN LIKE

803
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
THIS WHO KILLED DOZENS OF

804
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
PEOPLE.
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY WANT

805
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
GLORY.
THEY ARE SERIOUSLY ILL.

806
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
OTHERS WHO DO WANT GLORY.

807
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
YOU ARE RUSHING TO A PARTICULAR

808
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
INTERPRETATION OF THIS.

809
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
IT'S WAY TOO SOON TO KNOW.

810
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
>> SORRY.

811
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
>> I WOULD LIKE TO ENDORSE THAT

812
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
ALSO.

813
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I KNOW FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY, WE

814
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHY THIS

815
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
HAPPENED.
WHEN YOU ARE A PARENT YOU CAN'T

816
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
STOP THINKING ABOUT THESE

817
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
QUESTIONS THAT YOU ARE ASKING.

818
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN

819
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
ANSWERING THEM.

820
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
WHEN YOU MENTIONED THAT WE HAD

821
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
SEVERAL SIMILAR CASES RECENTLY,

822
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
YES, THESE WERE SIMILAR IN THAT

823
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
GUNS WERE USED AND THEY WERE

824
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
SPREE KILLINGS AND MASS

825
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
KILLINGS.
I CAN TELL YOU AS A MEDICAL

826
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
DOCTOR AND PSYCHIATRIST WHO

827
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
WORKED CLOSELY ON CASES, THERE

828
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
WERE DIFFERENT MOTIVES AND

829
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
MENTALITIES.

830
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
THERE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A

831
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
CONSCIOUS.

832
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
THEY TORTURE ANIMALS.

833
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
THEY HAVE NO BASIS IN THEIR MIND

834
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
FOR EMPATHY OR SYMPATHY.

835
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
THEY LEARN HOW TO FAKE IT.

836
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
ONE OF THE COLUMBINE KILLERS FIT

837
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
THAT PATTERN, BUT THE OTHER WAS

838
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
DIFFERENT.
HE WAS NOT A PSYCHOPATH.

839
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
IN THE CASE OF THE AURORA

840
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
SHOOTER, THE JURY IS NOT IN YET,

841
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
BUT I HAVE A FEELING WE WILL

842
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
FIND HE WAS ON THE VERGE OF

843
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
MAJOR MENTAL ILLNESS ABOUT

844
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
DELUSIONS AND HALLUCINATIONS.

845
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
ONE TIME IN MY LIFE I WAS

846
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL

847
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
PROGRAM OF MENTAL HEALTH

848
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
SERVICES IN AMERICA.

849
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I HAVE TO ADMIT WE FAILED.

850
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
WE FAILED AMERICA IN PROTECTING

851
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
THE LIVES OF THE SERIOUSLY

852
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
MENTALLY ILL.

853
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
MOST OF WHAT THEY DO IS SUFFER

854
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
IN SILENCE.

855
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
THEIR FAMILIES WANT TO DO BETTER

856
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
BY THEM AND AS A COUNTRY WE HAVE

857
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
NOT STEPPED UP AND BEEN

858
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
SYMPATHETIC AND CARING AND

859
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
APPROPRIATE FOR THE SERIOUSLY

860
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
MENTALLY ILL.

861
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
>> AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT POINT.

862
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY IS YOU

863
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
BOTH HAVE MADE EXTREMELY VALID

864
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
POINTS.

865
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
YOU HAVE THREE SUCCESSIVE

866
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
APPALLING MASS SHOOTINGS

867
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
INVOLVING YOUNG MEN IN THEIR 20s

868
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
WHERE THE BACKGROUND TO ALL OF

869
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
THEM WAS NOT DISSIMILAR.

870
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
THEY SEEM TO BE FAIRLY NORMAL

871
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
KIND OF SLIGHTLY OFF, BUT

872
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
NOTHING WITH ALARM BELLS.
THE POINT OF EXAMINING THEIR

873
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
CHARACTER IS THAT THERE MUST BE

874
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
A GOOD LIKELIHOOD THAT THERE

875
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
OTHERS LIKE THAT OUT THERE WHO

876
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
MAY BE CONSIDERING SIMILAR

877
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
ATROCITIES.

878
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
HOW DO PEOPLE WHO KNOW THESE
TYPES OF PEOPLE SPOT ANY WARNING

879
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
SIGNS?

880
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
>> PIERS --

881
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
>> LET ME START WITH THE DOCTOR.

882
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
>> I'M SORRY.

883
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I HAVE THREE SMALL CHILDREN.

884
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
BEFORE THIS INTERVIEW THEY ASKED

885
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
ME WHAT I WAS DOING AND WE

886
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR ABOUT AN

887
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
HOUR AND A HALF.
MY 9-YEAR-OLD GOT FRIGHTENED, HE

888
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
GOES TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

889
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THESE

890
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
THINGS ARE EXCEEDINGLY RARE.

891
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
LET'S NOT FORGET, THIS IS

892
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
EXCEEDINGLY RARE.

893
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING HAPPENED

894
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
IN THE LAST MONTH DOESN'T

895
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
STATISTICALLY MAKE IT A COMMON

896
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
OCCURRENCE.

897
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
LET'S BE CLEAR AND TELL OUR

898
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
CHILDREN THAT.

899
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TURN

900
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
TRAGEDY INTO AN OPPORTUNITY TO

901
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
FIX SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE

902
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
TERRIBLY BROKEN IN OUR MENTAL

903
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND KNOW HOW

904
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE AT RISK FOR

905
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
VIOLENCE.

906
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
IT'S ALL AT THE LEVEL OF STATE

907
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
FUNDING.

908
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
SORRY ABOUT GET GET INTO THE

909
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
SPECIFICS, BUT IT'S MENTAL

910
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
HEALTH CARE AND SCREENING OF NOT

911
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
ONLY YOUNG ADULTS AND CHILDREN

912
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
WHO OFFER A GOOD ASSESSMENT, WE

913
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
CAN IN FACT DO A MUCH BETTER JOB

914
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
OF NOT ONLY CARING FOR THE

915
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
PEOPLE AND IDENTIFY THOSE WHO

916
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
WOULD NEVER BE VIOLENT IF NOT

917
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
FOR A MENTAL ILLNESS.

918
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
THAT IS ONE BIT OF THE STORY.

919
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THERE IS ANOTHER PART WHICH IS

920
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
WHAT I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE

921
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH AND

922
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
INTERESTED IN BECAUSE OF MOVIES.

923
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
THE DIABOLICAL SOCIOPATH.

924
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
BOTH STORIES ARE TRUE, BUT BOTH

925
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
ARE ACTUALLY QUITE RARE.

926
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
>> THE FINAL WORD, MAKE IT BRIEF

927
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
IF YOU MAY.

928
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
>> AMERICA HAS MORE GUN DEATHS

929
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
THAN ANY OTHER ADVANCED NATION

930
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
IN THE WORLD.
WE HAVE LAWS THAT SAY IF YOU ARE

931
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL, YOU

932
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
SHOULDN'T POSSESS A WEAPON AND

933
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
WE DON'T ENFORCE THE LAWS.

934
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
WE HAVE TO GET TOGETHER ACROSS

935
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
THIS DIVIDE AND NEED THE NRA TO

936
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
STEP UP AND SAY THEY BELIEVE IN

937
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
GUN SAFETY AND NOT JUST IN GUN

938
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
OWNERSHIP.

939
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
WE NEED POLITICIANS ON BOTH

940
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
SIDES OF THE AISLE TO TACKLE

941
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
THIS PROBLEM.

942
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
WE WILL HAVE MORE DEAD AMERICAN

943
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
CHILDREN.
>> THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH.

944
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
STILL AHEAD, WE WILL TALK TO

945
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
SURVIVORS OF ANOTHER SHOOTING,

946
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
BUT NEXT THE PUSH FOR MORE GUN

947
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
CONTROL AFTER THE TRAGEDY.

948
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
OH, HEY MIKE.
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

949
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
OH, JUST DIAGRAMMING
THIS ACCIDENT

YOU CAN ALSO GET A QUOTE AND PAY
YOUR PREMIUM WITH THIS THING.

952
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I THOUGHT State Farm
DIDN'T HAVE ALL THOSE APPS?

953
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?
THE INTERNET.

954
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
AND YOU BELIEVED IT?

955
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
YEAH. THEY CAN'T PUT ANYTHING ON
THE INTERNET THAT ISN'T TRUE.

956
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

958
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
OH LOOK.
HERE COMES MY DATE.

959
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I MET HIM ON THE INTERNET.
HE'S A FRENCH MODEL.

WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COMING

967
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
TO AND TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION TO

968
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS

969
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
REGARDLESS OF THE TOLL PICKS.

970
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ON THE

971
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
SHOOTING.
THE MASSACRE IS RAISING NEW

972
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ACCESS OF

973
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
GUNS IN AMERICA.

974
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
HE IS URGENTLY CALLING FOR MORE

975
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
GUN CONTROL.

PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE.
THE ATTORNEY FOR THE MICHIGAN

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
AND RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS.

982
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
LET'S START WITH YOU.

983
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
YOU WERE PRETTY OUTSPOKEN SAYING

984
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
THIS IS TIME TO BRING IN NEW GUN

985
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
CONTROL LAWS.

986
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
>> YES.

987
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
IF THIS DOESN'T WAKE US UP, I

988
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL.

989
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I WAS HEARTENED THAT THE

990
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
PRESIDENT SAID WE HAD TO TAKE

991
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
MEANINGFUL ACTION AND THE ONLY

992
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
THING HE CAN DO IS LEAD A

993
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
CRUSADE FOR REASONABLE GUN

994
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
CONTROL LEGISLATION IN CONGRESS.

995
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
THESE MASSACRES ARE TAKING PLACE

996
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
MORE AND MORE OFTEN.

997
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
WE SAW BAY THE WAY TODAY A

998
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
SIMILAR INCIDENT IN CHINA WHERE

999
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
A MAD MAN ATTACKED AN ELEMENTARY

1000
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
SCHOOL IN CHINA WITH A KNIFE

1001
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
WITH 22 INJURED CHILDREN.

1002
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
NOT DEAD.

1003
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

1004
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
IN THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE

1005
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
9,000 PEOPLE KILLED WITH GUNS

1006
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
LAST YEAR IN SIMILAR COUNTRIES

1007
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
LIKE GERMANY, 170 AND CANADA

1008
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
150.
THERE IS A REASON FOR THAT.

1009
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
>> WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IN

1010
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
TERMS OF SPECIFIC GUN CONTROL?

1011
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
>> THERE A NUMBER OF PIECES OF

1012
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
LEGISLATION WE HAVE BEEN

1013
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
PUSHING.

1014
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
NO REASONABLE GUN OWNER WHO IS A

1015
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
SPORTSMAN CAN OBJECT TO BANS ON

1016
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS MADE ONLY TO

1017
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
KILL AS MANY HUMAN BEINGS AS

1018
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
POSSIBLE LIKE IN A MILITARY

1019
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
SITUATION.
NO ONE CAN OBJECT TO A BAN ON

1020
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
THE SALE OF LARGE AMMUNITION

1021
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
CLIPS SO YOU CAN'T RELOAD.

1022
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
NO ONE CAN OBJECT TO MIC

1023
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
MICROSTAMPING OF CARD RIDGES TO

1024
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
TRACE THE MURDER WEAPON.

1025
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
NO ONE CAN OBJECT TO ELIMINATING

1026
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
THE GUNSHOT EXCEPTION SO EVEN IF

1027
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
YOU BUY A GUN AT A GUN SHOW,

1028
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
THEY STILL HAVE TO CHECK YOUR

1029
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
BACKGROUND TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE

1030
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
NOT SELLING TO SOMEONE ON A

1031
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
TERRORIST WATCH LIST OR MENTALLY

1032
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
UNSTABLE PERSON OR A FELON.

1033
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
THOSE ARES WE SHOULD DO.

1034
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
>> WE HAD A HEATED DEBATE ON A

1035
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
PREVIOUS INCIDENT.
TWO THINGS HAPPENED IN 1996.

1036
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
THERE WAS A MASS KERR IN TAZ

1037
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
MANIA IN WHICH 35 PEOPLE WERE

1038
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
KILLED.

1040
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
AND FRIENDS OF GEORGE W. BUSH

1041
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
AND BROUGHT IN DRACONIAN LAWS

1042
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
AFTER THAT.

1043
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
HE BROUGHT IN RIFLES AND

1044
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
SHOTGUNS.
AS A RESULT OF THE NEXT DECADE,

1046
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000

1047
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
65%.
>> NOT TRUE.

1048
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
>> IT IS TRUE.

1049
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

1050
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
IF YOU LOOK OVERTIME --

1051
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000

1052
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
>> I'M TELLING YOU PEOPLE CAN

1053
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
LOOK IT UP THEMSELVES.

WHAT YOU FIND IS FOR DECADES THE

1056
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
AUSTRALIA.
IT BASICALLY STOPPED FALLING.

1057
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
IF YOU COMPARE THE AVERAGE O TWO

1058
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
DECADES WHERE IT'S FALLING TO

1059
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
WHAT IT WAS AFTERWARDS, IT MAKES

1060
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
IT LOOK LIKE THE AVERAGE BEFORE

1061
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
IS HIGHER THAN AFTERWARDS.

1062
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
IF YOU LOOK ON A YEAR BY YEAR

1063
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
BASIS, THERE WASN'T THAT FALL.

1064
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000

1065
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
NEED TO HAVE THESE THREE

1066
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000

THESE THREE WEAPONS PERFORMED

1070
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000

>> WHATEVER THAT GUN LOOKS LIKE,

1079
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
IT'S A SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLE.

1080
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
ANY HUNTING RIFLE IS SEMI

1081
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
AUTOMATIC.

1082
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
DOESN'T MEAN IT FUNCTIONS

1083
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
DIFFERENTLY.

1084
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000

SEVERAL MINUTES WITH THIS

1086
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
APPARENTLY HARMLESS RIFLE.

1087
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
>> GUNS MAKE IT EASY.

1088
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
>> YOU ARE TRYING TO SAY IT'S AN

1089
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
AVERAGE GUN.
HE FIRED OVER 100 ROUNDS AND

1090
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
KILLED 20 CHILDREN.

1091
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
20 CHILDREN BETWEEN 5 AND 10.

1092
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
WHAT POINT DO YOU SAY WE GET IT?

1093
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE?

1094
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
>> IT IS TIME.

1095
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
>> TIME TO DO WHAT?

1096
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
>> TO GET RID OF THE GUN LAWS

1097
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
THAT CAUSE --

1098
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
>> TO GET RID OF WHAT?

1099
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
>> LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED.

1100
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
ALL THE ATTACK THIS IS YEAR

1101
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
OCCURRED WHERE GUNS ARE BANNED.

1102
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
LOOK AT THE AURORA SHOOTING.

1103
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
>> WHAT THE HELL HAS THAT GOT TO

1104
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
DO WITH IT?

1105
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
SERIOUSLY.
WHAT HAS THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT?

1106
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
>> YOU NEVER LET ME EXPLAIN.

1107
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

1108
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
>> IS IT A GUN-FREE ZONE.

1109
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
>> LOOK AT THE MOVIE THEATER

1110
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
ONE.
THERE WERE SEVEN MOVIE THEATERS

1111
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
SHOWING THE MOVIE WITHIN A 20

1112
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
MINUTE DRIVE OF WHERE THE KILLER

1113
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
LIVED.
ONLY ONE OF THOSE BANNED GUNS.

1114
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
HE DIDN'T GO CLOSE TOAST HIS

1115
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
HOME OR WITH THE LARGEST SCREEN.

1116
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
HE WENT TO THE ONE MOVIE THEATER

1117
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
THAT BANNED GUNS.

1118
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
IF YOU LOOK AT BANS GENERALLY,

1119
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
YOU CAN'T POINT TO A PLACE,

1120
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
CHICAGO, D.C. WHERE WE BAN GUNS

1121
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
AND MURDER RATES AND VIOLENT

1122
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
CRIMES WENT UP.

1123
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
IN THE UK IN JAMAICA AND

1124
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
IRELAND, ISLAND NATIONS THAT

1125
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
BANNED GUNS, YOU CAN'T FIND A

1126
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
PLACE WHERE MURDER RATES HAVE

1127
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
GONE DOWN.

1128
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
THEY HAVE GONE UP USUALLY BY

1129
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
LARGE AMOUNTS.

1130
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
>> YOU CANNOT FIND A PLACE --

1131
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
>> LET ME BRING IN.

1132
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, BASICALLY EVERY

1133
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
STATISTIC THAT JOHN CITED IS

1134
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
PURE BUNK IN TERMS OF THE FACT

1135
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
THAT THE MORE GUNS EQUAL --

1136
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
THAT'S TRUE.

1137
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
THEY WERE GUN-FREE ZONES, BUT

1138
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
ATTRIBUTING THAT TO THE FACT

1139
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
THAT THIS VIOLENCE OCCURRED,

1140
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
THAT'S WHERE I HAVE TO STEP IN.

1141
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
LISTEN, MY BROTHER WAS SHOT IN A

1142
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
SHOOTING ON TOP OF THE EMPIRE

1143
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
STATE BUILDING WHICH WAS

1144
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
CHAOTIC.
I KNOW FIRSTHAND I TALKED WITH

1145
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
THE VICTIMS FROM THE AURORA

1146
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
TRAGEDY.

1147
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
TO A PERSON, THEY ALL SAY IF

1148
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
THERE WERE ANOTHER PERSON ARMED,

1149
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
IT WOULD HAVE LED TO MORE

1150
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
CARNAGE.
EXCUSE ME.

1151
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I LET YOU TALK, LET ME FINISH.

1152
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
LET ME FINISH.

1153
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
IF EVERY ONE OF THE CASES THEY

1154
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
SAY IF THERE WERE MORE GUNS, IT

1155
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
WOULD HAVE ONLY LED TO MORE

1156
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
CHAOS.

1157
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
AT THE EMPIRE BUILDING SHOOTING

1158
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
IN NEW YORK.
THERE WERE HIGHLY TRAINED

1159
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
OFFICERS IN THE CHAOS AND EIGHT

1160
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
OTHER PEOPLE SHOT AND EVERY ONE

1161
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
WAS AN INNOCENT CIVILIAN AND

1162
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
EVERY ONE WAS SHOT BY A LAW

1163
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.

1164
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
>> WE HAVE THE ATTORNEY FOR THE

1165
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS.

1166
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE

1167
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
MORE GUNS IN SCHOOLS.

1168
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
SNART?
>> I BELIEVE THOSE OF US WHO ARE

1169
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
LICENSED TO CARRY ARE

1170
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE AND SHOULDN'T

1171
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
BE PROHIBITED FROM CARRYING IN

1172
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
SCHOOLS OR OTHER PLACES.

1173
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
IN FACT, THE MICHIGAN

1174
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL LAST

1175
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
NIGHT AND SENT TO THE GOVERNMENT

1176
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
FOR SIGNATURE A BILL THAT WOULD

1177
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
ALLOW THOSE OF US WHO ARE

1178
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
LICENSED TO TAKE MORE DAY OF

1179
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
TRAINING INCLUDING RANGE TIME

1180
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
AND BE ABLE TO CARRY IN THE

1181
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
PLACES WHERE WE COULDN'T CARRY

1182
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
BEFORE.

1183
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
>> WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU WANT

1184
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
MORE GUNS IN SCHOOLS AFTER WHAT

1185
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
HAPPENED TODAY?

1186
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
>> HERE'S WHY, PIERS.

1187
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
IF WE COULD SUDDENLY MAKE ALL

1188
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
GUNS DISAPPEAR, I WOULD HAVE A

1189
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
DIFFERENT POSITION.

1190
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME THINKING

1191
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
ABOUT THIS AND READING ABOUT

1192
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
THIS.
I TEACH A CLASS CALLED GUN

1193
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
CONTROL SEMINAR AND I GET A NEW

1194
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
GROUP EVERY TIME AND WE DISCUSS

1195
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
THIS IN DETAIL.

1196
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
THE SIMPLE FACTS ARE GUNS EXIST.

1197
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY 1800s

1198
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
TECHNOLOGY.

1199
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
SEMI AUTOMOBILES WERE IN THE

1200
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
LATE 1800s.

1201
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
THEY ARE EASY TO MAKE AND LAST

1202
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
SEVERAL HUMAN LIFETIMES WITH

1203
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
MINIMAL MAINTENANCE.

1204
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
SINCE GUNS EXIST AND WE KNOW FOR

1205
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
A EXACT THAT THE ONLY WAY TO

1206
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
STOP AN EVIL PERSON LIKE THE

1207
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
PERSON YOU WERE DISCUSSING

1208
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
EARLIER IN THE SHOW IS TO SHOOT

1209
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
THEM.
>> THIS IS EXACTLY THE ARGUMENT

1210
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I HAVE BEEN HEARING EVER SINCE I

1211
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
JOINED CNN.

1212
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I JOINED ON AIR ABOUT A WEEK

1213
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
AFTER GABBY GIFFORDS THE

1214
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
CONGRESSWOMAN WAS SHOT IN THE

1215
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
HEAD.
EVER SINCE THEN, WE HAVE THE

1216
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
SIKH TEMPLE AND AURORA AND THE

1217
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
SHOPPING MALL AND SO ON AND SO

1218
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
ON.
THE ARGUMENT I KEEP HEARING IF

1219
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
EVERYBODY WAS WAS ARMED, IT

1220
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
WOULDN'T HAPPEN.

1221
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
IT'S HOG WASH, ISN'T IT?

1222
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
IF EVERYONE IN THAT MOVIE

1223
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
THEATER HAD GUNS, MORE PEOPLE

1224
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE

1225
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
MAYHEM THAT ERUPTED.

1226
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
>> THE PEOPLE THAT STOPPED THE

1227
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
ATTACKS.
>>> CAN I JUST --

1228
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
>> THE PROVE IN THE PUDDING.

1229
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
YOU DON'T SEE OTHER SHOOTINGS AT

1230
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
GUN SHOWS OR --

1231
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
>> THEY HAVE REASONABLE LAWS AND

1232
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
THEY HAVE 100 PEOPLE A YEAR NOT

1233
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
9,000 OR 10,000 A YEAR.

1234
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
>> LISTEN --

1235
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
>> IT WAS LOWER BEFORE GUN

1236
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
CONTROL.
>> THEY GOT THE GUN ZOEL.

1237
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
>> ALMOST ZERO CRIME.

1238
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
>> THE GUN CONTROL DOESN'T

1239
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
CHANGE IT.

1240
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
>> SCOTLAND IN 1996 THERE WAS A

1241
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
SIMILAR SCHOOL SHOOTING.

1242
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
JUST AN AWFUL SITUATION.

1243
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
16 YOUNG CHILDREN KILLED EXACTLY

1244
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
AS THEY WERE TODAY.

1245
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
AS A RESULT OF THIS, THEY

1246
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
BROUGHT IN A HAND GUN BAN.

1247
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
162,000 HAND GUNS WERE HANDED

1248
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
IN.
IT IS TIME FOR THIS.

1249
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
>> LISTEN --

1250
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
>> MURDER RATES WENT UP.

1251
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
>> THERE ABOUT 35 MURDERS A

1252
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
YEAR.
THERE 12,000 MURDERS A YEAR FROM

1253
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY.

1254
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
WHEN ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO FOCUS

1255
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
ON THAT AND STOP TELLING ME THE

1256
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
ANSWER IS MORE GUNS.

1257
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
IT IS NOT THE ANSWER.

1258
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
>> AFTER THE BAN, IT WAS HIGHER

1259
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE BAN.

1260
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
>> YOU WANT MORE GUNS AND NOT

1261
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
LESS?

1262
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
300 MILLION GUNS IN AMERICA IS

1263
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU?

1264
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
HOW MANY MORE KIDS HAVE TO DIE

1265
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
BEFORE YOU GUYS SAY WE WANT LESS

1266
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
GUNS AND NOT MORE?

1267
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
>> HE ASKED ME A QUESTION.

1268
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
>> LET HIM ANSWER THE QUESTION.

1269
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
>> IMUPSET THAT THE GUN CONTROL

1270
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
LAWS YOU ARE PUSHING HAVE KILLED

1271
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
PEOPLE.

1272
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
>> THAT IS NON--Y IS SENSE.

1273
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
NONSENSE.

1274
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
AVERAGE OF 35 KILLINGS IN

1275
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
BRITAIN A GLEER A PLACE OF

1276
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
BANNED HAND GUNS.

1277
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
HERE NO BANS AND 12,000 PEOPLE A

1278
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
YEAR DIE FROM GUN MURDERS.

1279
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
>> YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND YOU

1280
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
BAN THEM --

1281
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
>> I HAVE BEEN DEBATING THIS ALL

1282
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
WEEK WITH THE SHOPPING MALL

1283
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
SHOOTING AND MONTHS IF NOT TWO

1284
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
YEARS.

1285
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I AM SO FRUSTRATED AND FURIOUS

1286
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
FOR THESE KIDS WHO ARE BEING

1287
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
BLOWN AWAY AGAIN WITH LEGALLY

1288
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
ACQUIRED WEAPONS.

1289
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
SOME BOY WHO HAS PROBLEMS TAKES

1290
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
HIS MOTHER'S THREE WEAPONS

1291
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
INCLUDING THIS RIDICULOUS

1292
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
ASSAULT RIFLE AND GOES IN THE

1293
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
SCHOOL AND KILLS THESE KIDS AND

1294
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
YOU GUYS STILL WANT TO TELL ME

1295
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
THE ANSWER IS MORE GUNS?

1296
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
IT IS MADNESS!

1297
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
>> HOW ELSE CAN YOU STOP SOMEONE

1298
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
FROM SHOOTING PEOPLE.

1299
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
WHAT ARE WE MOST ANGRY ABOUT?

1300
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
EVERY POLL SHOWS BY MASSIVE

1301
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
MAJORITIES AMERICANS AGREE WITH

1302
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
WHAT YOU SAID.

1303
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
YET WE HAVE A LOBBY.

1304
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
THE LEADERSHIP WHO FUNCTION AS

1305
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
LEADERS WHO ARE ENABLERS OF MASS

1306
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
MURDER.

1307
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
POLITICAL PEOPLE AND EVEN THOUGH

1308
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
POLLING SHOWS THAT MOST NRA

1309
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
MEMBERS WOULD SUPPORT REASONABLE

1310
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
GUN CONTROLS, THEY COME IN AND

1311
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
LIE AND SAY THEY WILL TAKE YOUR

1312
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
GUNS AWAY AND STOP ANY

1313
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
LEGISLATION TO PREVENT THAT.

1314
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT ENABLING.

1315
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
>> NOBODY NEEDS ONE OF THESE IN

1316
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
THEIR HOME.

1317
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
END OF STORY.

1318
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
>> I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.

1319
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
>> THE ENCOURAGING THING AND

1320
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
WHAT YOU SHOULD TAKE INSPIRATION

1321
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
BECAUSE WE ARE ALL FRUSTRATED

1322
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
AND OUTRAGED.

1323
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
THIS CONVERSATION AND WHAT THESE

1324
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
GUYS ARE SAYING DOES NOT

1325
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
REPRESENT WHAT THE AMERICAN

1326
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
PUBLIC WANTS AND THE

1327
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
CONVERSATION THAT THE AMERICAN

1328
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
PUBLIC WANTS TO HAVE.

1329
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
WE ARE ALL IN FAVOR OF THINGS

1330
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
LIKE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.

1331
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
74% OF NRA MEMBERS ARE AND MOST

1332
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
GUN SALES DO NOT REQUIRE A

1333
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
BACKGROUND CHECK.
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO.

1334
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
>> IT'S NOT AS THEY TRY TO TELL

1335
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
ME AN ANTI-AMERICAN THING TO SAY

1336
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I RESPECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT

1337
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
AND I RESPECT THE RIGHT SECOND

1338
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
AMENDMENT.

1339
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I DON'T RESPECT THE RIGHT FOR

1340
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
FAMILIES TO LOAD THEIR HOMES

1341
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
WITH THESE SO A DISTURBED KID

1342
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
CAN TAKE THEM AND SOMETHING INTO

1343
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
A SCHOOL.

1344
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
>> THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS NOS

1345
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
AT POLARIZED AS THIS GENTLEMAN

1346
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
IS SAYING.

1347
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
>> THIS WILL CONTINUE NEXT WEEK.

1348
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
COME NEXT WEEK WHEN YOU HAVE

1349
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
TIME TO THINK ABOUT THIS YOU

1350
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR THINKING.

1351
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
THE GUN LOBBY HAS TO CHANGE ITS

1352
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
THINKING.

1353
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
>> WHY DO ALL OF THESE --

1354
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
>> WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE.

1355
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
COMING NEXT, SURVIVORS FROM

1356
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
OTHER MASS SHOOTINGS SHARE THEIR

1357
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
THOUGHTS ON TODAY'S APPALLING

1358
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
MASSACRE.

1359
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
>>> THE MOST DISTURBING ISSUES

1360
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
FROM THE SHOOTING, POLICE

1361
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
OFFICERS ESCORTING

1362
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
SCHOOLCHILDREN FROM THE SCHOOL.

1363
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
ANOTHER PICTURE FROM THE MASS

1364
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
SHOOTING IN 1999.

1365
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
WE HAVE A VICTIM OF THE

1366
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
SHOOTING, JOINS ME NOW.

1367
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
AND WE HAVE ANOTHER JCC

1368
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
SURVIVOR, AND A SURVIVOR OF THE

1369
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
TRAGEDY IN AURORA, AND THE

1370
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
BROTHER OF A SHOOTING AT THE

1371
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

1372
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
THIS MUST HAVE BROUGHT BACK

1373
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
AWFUL MEMORIES FOR YOU TODAY, AS

1374
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
IT DOES I WOULD IMAGINE WHENEVER

1375
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
THERE IS A MASS SHOOTING IN

1376
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
AMERICA.
WHAT WERE YOUR FEELINGS?

1377
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
>> IT'S -- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO

1378
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
PUT WORDS TO WHAT I REALLY FEEL.

1379
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
IT'S A MIXTURE OF SYMPATHY AND

1380
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
DISGUST.
AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO THOSE

1381
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
FAMILIES AND THERE ARE PEOPLE

1382
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THE SAME

1383
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
THING AND WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT

1384
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
ARE YOU GOING THROUGH, AND

1385
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
IMMEDIATELY WHAT I THOUGHT WAS

1386
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
JUST THAT I WISH THAT THERE WAS

1387
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
SOMETHING I COULD DO TO HELP

1388
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
THEM.

1389
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, IN REALITY, IT'S

1390
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
A HELPLESS SITUATION.

1391
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
>> MINDY, YOU SURVIVED WHAT

1392
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
HAPPENED TO YOU.

1393
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
WHEN YOU HEAR THE RAGING GUN

1394
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
DEBATE, WHICH WILL BE

1395
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
PARTICULARLY VOCIFEROUS IN LIGHT

1396
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
OF THIS APPALLING ACT TODAY.

1397
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
DO YOU THINK THAT TOUGHER LAWS

1398
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
SHOULD BE BROUGHT IN TO TRY AND

1399
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?

1400
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
>> YOU KNOW, I DO.

1401
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I THINK JOSH AND I AND EVERYONE

1402
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
IN OUR COMMUNITY IN THIS WEIRD

1403
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
FAMILY WE HAVE, SURVIVORS OF GUN

1404
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
VIOLENCE, WISHES THE DAY AFTER

1405
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM, NOBODY

1406
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
ELSE HAS TO GO THROUGH IT.

1407
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
UNFORTUNATELY, 13.5 YEARS LATER,

1408
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
WE'RE SITTING HERE WATCHING

1409
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
THESE TRAGEDIES UNFOLD ON A

1410
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
DAILY BASIS.
>> YOU WERE 16 AT THE TIME OF

1411
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
THE SHOOTING.

1412
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
OBVIOUSLY, A LOT OF KIDS AT THE

1413
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
SCHOOL TODAY WILL BE MUCH

1414
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
YOUNGER THAN THAT, AND THEY WILL

1415
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
HAVE EITHER LOST FRIENDS OR

1416
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
PEOPLE THEY KNEW AT THE SCHOOL

1417
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR

1418
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
THEM WHEN THEY HAVE TO GO BACK.

1419
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE THEM?

1420
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO TRY AND

1421
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
DEAL WITH THIS?

1422
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
BEST SERVED FOR THEIR PARENTS.

1423
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> YOU KNOW, TO BE HONEST, IT'S

1424
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
HEARTBREAKING.

1425
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO

1426
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
KNOW REALLY WHAT OR HOW TO FEEL

1427
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
UNTIL FIVE, TEN YEARS FROM NOW,

1428
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
WHEN IT ACTUALLY KEEPS HAUNTING

1429
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
THEM AND NIGHTMARES AND FEARS
THAT KEEP COMING UP.

1430
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
JOSH CAN SPEAK TO THAT HIMSELF,

1431
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD AT THE

1432
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
TIME, AND, YOU KNOW, NOW HE'S IN

1433
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
HIS 20s AND IT HAUNTS HIM EVERY

1434
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
DAY.
I WAS 16, I KNEW WHY I WAS SHOT.

1435
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I KNEW SOMEBODY TRIED TO KILL

1436
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
ME, AND EVERY DAY, MY ENTIRE

1437
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
LIFE, I'M ALMOST 30 YEARS OLD,

1438
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I'M HAUNTED.
THERE IS NOTHING I CAN SAY TO

1439
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
THEM THAT I AM SO, SO SORRY THEY

1440
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS, AND I

1441
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
REALLY TRULY HOPE SOMETHING WILL

1442
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
BE DONE AFTER TODAY, BECAUSE WE

1443
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
CANNOT STAND FOR THIS ANYMORE.

1444
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
>> STEVEN BARTON, YOU SURVIVED

1445
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
THE AURORA MASSACRE A FEW MONTHS

1446
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
AGO, A HUGE OUTCRY THEN AND

1447
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
PEOPLE PROMISED TO DO ALL SORTS

1448
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
OF THINGS, POLITICIAN MOUTHS THE

1449
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
USUAL RHETORIC, ABSOLUTELY

1450
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
NOTHING HAPPENED, AND LO AND

1451
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
BEHOLD, HERE WE ARE WITH AN EVEN

1452
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
WORSE TRAGEDY.

1453
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
MORE DEAD, AND THIS TIME, 20

1454
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
YOUNG KIDS.

1455
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ABOUT THE

1456
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
DEBATE THAT WILL NOW UNFOLD ON

1457
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
THIS?
>> I MEAN, I THINK THE PRESIDENT

1458
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
SAID WE NEED A MEANINGFUL ACTION

1459
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
NOW, AND HE SAID THAT IN THE

1460
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
PAST, AND SO I'LL BE WAITING FOR

1461
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
THAT ACTION.

1462
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
IT'S A SHAME THAT 20 CHILDREN

1463
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
HAVE TO BE SLAIN FOR US TO EVEN

1464
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
START TALKING ABOUT THIS.

1465
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
BUT I REALLY THINK THAT THE

1466
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
AMERICAN PUBLIC IS FED UP WITH

1467
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
THE LACK OF CONVERSATION ON THIS

1468
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
ISSUE.
>> AND THERE WILL BE MORE MASS

1469
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
SHOOTINGS IN THE LAST FIVE OR

1470
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
SIX YEARS AND IN THE PREVIOUS

1471
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
FOUR DECADES IN TERMS OF THE

1472
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
PARTICULARLY APPALLING ONES.

1473
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
AND YET YOU KEEP BEING TOLD,

1474
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
WELL, NOT AS BAD AS IT SEEMS.

1475
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
THE SITUATION, BUT IT TRULY IS.

1476
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE, I'VE BEEN

1477
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
UTTERLY HORRIFIED, WHY I GET SO

1478
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
ANIMATED WHEN I DEBATE IT ON THE

1479
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
SHOW.
I COME FROM A COUNTRY WHERE THIS

1480
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE.

1481
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
MOVIE THEATERS, SHOPPING MALLS,

1482
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS WOULD BE

1483
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
SHOT DOWN IN AN INDISCRIMINATE

1484
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
WAY ON A BIMONTHLY BASIS.

1485
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I DON'T GET WHY AMERICANS AREN'T

1486
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
FAR MORE ANGRY.

1487
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
>> IT'S ONE THING FOR A

1488
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
POLITICIAN TO TAKE ACTION, BUT

1489
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE

1490
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
AMERICAN PUBLIC DEMANDS THESE

1491
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
REFORMS, THESE CHANGES, AND THE

1492
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
POLLING IS CLEAR.
SUPPORT FOR COMMON SENSE GUN

1493
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
REFORM.

1494
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
82 PERCENT GUN OWNERS SUPPORT

1495
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.

1496
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
IT'S A FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM WE

1497
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
HAVEN'T ARRIVED AT THAT POINT

1498
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
YET.

1499
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
>> PAULA, YOUR BROTHER WAS

1500
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
KILLED IN THE EMPIRE STATE

1501
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
BUILDING SHOOTING.

1502
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
YOU BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT TO OWN

1503
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
A HANDGUN AND A REFERENDUM

1504
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
WASN'T NEEDED.

1505
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
>> I THINK TODAY A REFUERENDUM S

1506
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
NEEDED.

1507
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
AS A FATHER, INNOCENT CHILDREN,

1508
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I SEE THE HEART BREAK, WE HAVE

1509
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
TO GO BACK TO THAT.

1510
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
WE HAVE 20 FAMILIES, 26 FAMILIES

1511
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
THAT ARE DEVASTATED RIGHT NOW,

1512
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
WHILE WE'RE HAVING THIS DEBATE.

1513
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO

1514
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
FOCUS ON.

1515
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
THIS IS ABOUT GUN CONTROL, ABOUT

1516
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
MENTAL ILLNESS AND A

1517
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
COMBINATION.
IT'S GOT TO BE ALL GROUPS THAT

1518
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
COME TOGETHER.
>> IT INCLUDES VIOLENT VIDEO

1519
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
GAMES, HOLLYWOOD MOVIES.

1520
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
>> GUN VIOLENCE CULTURE IN

1521
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
AMERICA.

1522
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
>> IT HAS GOT TO BE TACKLED, AND

1523
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
ALL AREAS.
A PROPER DEBATE.

1524
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
MY ARGUMENT IS, POLITICIANS HERE

1525
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS DEBATE.

1526
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
>> WELL, THEY HAVE TO.

1527
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
THEY HAVE TO.

1528
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CONGRESSMAN

1529
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
LIKE JERRY NADLER ON TODAY, YOU

1530
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
HAVE TO HAVE A REPUBLICAN

1531
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
CONGRESSMAN STEP UP, GET

1532
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
TOGETHER.
THIS HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE
