IN.

718
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000

INDUSTRY.

732
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
FIREFIGHTERS WERE CONCERNED

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
ABOUT THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

734
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000

FIRE.

735
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
THEY ASKED EVERYONE IN THE AREA

736
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
TO PUT A SHELTER IN PLACE BUT IT

737
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
TURNED OUT IT WAS FINE BECAUSE

WHILE THE COMPANY TRIES TO
