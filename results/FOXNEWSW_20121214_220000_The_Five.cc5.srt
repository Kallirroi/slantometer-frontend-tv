00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
LOCKDOWN.
I DIDN'T TAKE IT TOO SERIOUSLY

377
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
BECAUSE WE HAD SOMETHING LIKE

378
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
THIS HAPPEN PRIOR, BUT IT WAS

379
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
A SHOOTING ON THE STREET AND

380
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE SCHOOL.

381
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
BUT THEN I RECEIVED A TEXT

382
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000

383
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
SHE IS IN THE THIRD GRADE.

387
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I DROVE MY CAR AND SAW PEOPLE

388
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I KNEW AND THEY WERE

389
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
HYSTERICAL.

390
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I SAID WHAT HAPPENED?

391
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
>> WERE THERE POLICE THERE?

392
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000

BRINGING THE PARENTS AND THE

398
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
CHILDREN IN TO THE FIREHOUSE.

399
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
ALL I HEARD WAS A NEIGHBOR WHO T

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000

401
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000

402
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
RIGHT THEN AND THERE I THOUGHT

403
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000

AND SHE SAID SHE IS FINE.

409
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
AND SHE WAS WITH HER TEACHER.

410
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
>> THAT HAD TO BE A MOMENT OF

411
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
IMMENSE RELIEF.

412
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000

00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
BEING QUESTIONED.

749
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
BILL HEMMER IS LIVE IN

750
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
CONNECTICUT WHERE IT ALL TOOK

751
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
PLACE.
BILL?

752
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
>> Reporter: GOOD EVENING.

753
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
WE WERE ON THE AIR ON

754
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
"AMERICA'S NEWSROOM" WHEN THE

755
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
NEWS CROSSED IT 10:30 EASTERN

756
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
TIME.

757
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
INITIAL REPORT CAME OUT A

758
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
TEACHER HAD BEEN SHOT IN THE

759
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
FOOT.

760
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
WE WENT A GOOD STRETCH OF

761
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
TIME, AS YOU RECALL, WITHOUT A

762
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
LOT MORE INFORMATION BEYOND

763
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
THAT.
NOW THIS PICTURE STARTS TO

764
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
COME IN FULL VIEW ABOUT THE

765
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
ABSOLUTE MASSACRE THAT HAD

766
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
TAKEN PLACE INSIDE OF THIS

767
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
TINY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

768
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
THE THING THAT STRIKES YOU

769
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
ABOUT THAT PART OF CONNECTICUT

770
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
IS HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS.

771
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
WE'RE A FEW HUNDRED YARDS FROM

772
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
THE SCHOOL.

773
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
BUT IMAGINE THE YOUNG AND

774
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
6-YEAR-OLD KIDS, THEY PLAYED

775
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
HERE.
THIS IS THEIR PLAYGROUND.

776
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD ON THE

777
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
WEEKEND THIS IS WHERE THEY

778
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
SPENT TIME WITH THEIR

779
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
FAMILIES.
THIS IS STUNNING TO COME TO

780
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
TOWNS LIKE THESE AND SEE

781
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
REACTION ON THE FACES AND IN

782
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE YOU

783
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
COME ACROSS.

784
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
WE ARE AT A COFFEE SHOP DOWN

785
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
THE ROAD AN HOUR AGO.

786
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
WE MET A WOMAN WITH THEIR TWO

787
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
DAUGHTERS.

788
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I SEE IN THEIR EYES.

789
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I SAID HOW ARE YOU DOING?

790
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
THEY SHOOK THEIR HEAD AND SAID

791
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
WE'RE ALL RIGHT.

792
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
THE GIRL SAID, "TODAY IS MY

793
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
BIRTHDAY."
SHE ASKED ME IF IT WAS HER

794
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
9/11.

795
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
SHE TURNED 11 TODAY.

796
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
SHE WAS NOT BORN ON 9/11.

797
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
A TOWN UNDERSTANDABLY STUNNED.

798
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE

799
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
COUNTRY.

800
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
>> Jon: YOU KNOW IT WILL BE

801
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
SOME TIME BEFORE THEY REOPEN

802
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
THE SCHOOL, MAYBE IF AT ALL.

803
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
IT WILL BE FILLED WITH

804
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
HORRIBLE MEMORIES FOR THE

805
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
CHILDREN WHO WERE THERE.

806
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
>> Reporter: JON, I TOOK A

807
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
WALK DOWN THERE A SHORT TIME

808
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
AGO.
THROUGH THE WOODS DOWN THE

809
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
HILL.

810
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
THIS WOODED AREA SURROUNDS THE

811
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
SCHOOL.

812
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
IT'S A TINY PLACE.

813
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FOURTH

814
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
GRADE.

815
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
IT APPEARED TO ME LIKE ONE

816
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
SINGLE BUILDING THERE THAT WAS

817
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
BUILT IN A SQUARE SHAPE WITH A

818
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
COURTYARD IN THE MIDDLE.

819
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
THE PARKING LOT IS NOT BIG.

820
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
RIGHT NOW, JON, THERE ARE

821
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
STATE TROOPERS, AND

822
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
INVESTIGATORS AND CARS THAT

823
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
FILLED THAT ENTIRE PARKING

824
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
LOT.
THEY HAD MENTIONED EARLIER

825
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
TODAY THAT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD

826
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
THEY WOULD NOT MOVE THE BODIES

827
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
FOR SOME TIME, BECAUSE THEY

828
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
WANT TO ASSESS THE CRIME

829
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
SCENE.

830
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW GRISLY IT

831
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
MUST HAVE BEEN AS THEY FIRST

832
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
SAW THE CRIME SCENE.

833
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
BASED ON THE NEWS CONFERENCE

834
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN SO FAR AND

835
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
TIDBIT OF INFORMATION THERE IS

836
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
SO MUCH STILL THEY DO NOT

837
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
KNOW.
>> Jon: THINK ABOUT THE

838
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
ANGUISH FOR PARENTS WHO KNOW

839
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
OR SUSPECT THEIR CHILDREN ARE

840
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
STILL INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.

841
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
THEY CANNOT HOLD THEM, TOUCH

842
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
THEM OR CAR RES THEM OR SAY

843
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
GOODBYE.

844
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
NOT YET.

845
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
>> Reporter: JON, YOU THINK

846
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
ABOUT CHRISTMAS DAY, TEN, 11

847
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
DAYS FROM NOW.

848
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
YOU KNOW THESE PARENTS ALREADY

849
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
BOUGHT PRESENTS, SOME OF THEM

850
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
PERHAPS WERE ALREADY WRAPPED.

851
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
NOW THEY DO NOT HAVE A CHILD

852
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
TO GIVE THAT PRESENT TO.

853
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
YOU HEARD THE ELOQUENT WORDS

854
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
OF THE PRESIDENT A FEW MOMENTS

855
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
AGO.

856
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
THAT'S WHAT SO MANY PARENTS

857
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
FEEL TONIGHT.
TO SEE THE KIDS IN PERSON.

858
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
TO GIVE THEM A HUG.

859
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
TO EXPRESS THE LOVE THEY HAVE

860
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
FOR THEM AND GRATEFULNESS THEY

861
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
HAVE TO BE TOGETHER.

862
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON.

863
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
SO MANY IN THIS TOWN DO NOT.

864
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
>> Jon: NEWTOWN,

00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000

00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

>> Reporter: JON, FOR PEOPLE

1141
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000

1142
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000

POLICE ARE AT THE SCHOOL NOW.

1162
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000

1164
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE

THE FATHER APPARENTLY IS STILL

1171
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
ALIVE.
I SHOULDN'T SAY APPARENTLY.

1172
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
HIS FATHER I'M TOLD IS ALIVE

1173

BUT AS YOU ARE POINTING OUT.

1186
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
>> I'M NOT SURE WHERE THAT

1187
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
CAME FROM.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE REPORT

1188
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
CAME FROM.

1189
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
THERE WERE REPORTS AN ACTIVE

1190
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
SCENE IN NEW JERSEY.

1191
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
THAT IS TRUE.

1192
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
THE BROTHER IS TALKING TO

1193
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000

00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
PEOPLE INSIDE.

00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000

IT IS.
THANK YOU.

1202
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
LET'S CHECK IN WITH DR. KEITH

MEDICAL A-TEAMER WHO JOINS US

1205
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000

YOU HEAR WHAT HAPPENED, DOCK

1207
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
TOKER AND IT'S -- DOCTOR, AND

1208
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
IT'S CONCEIVABLE.

1209
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
IS IT MENTAL ILLNESS,

1210
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
SOCIOPATHIC PERSONALITY?
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT HERE?

1211
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
LOOKING AT SOMETHING DEEPLY

1212
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
DISTURBED UNFOLDING HERE,

1213
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
OBVIOUSLY.

1214
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE ACT OF

1215
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
WALKING IN TO A SCHOOL AND

1216
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
BEING UNDETERRED, BY THE

1217
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
INJURIES, FATAL INJURIES THAT

1218
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
YOU ARE INFLICTING ON ONE

1219
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
AFTER ANOTHER CHILD THEN YOUR

1220
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
CAPACITY TO FEEL FOR OTHERS IS

1221
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
ENTIRELY SHATTERED.

1222
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
WHAT WE CALL THIS WILL BE

1223
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
DETERMINED IN DAYS AND WEEKS

1224
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
TO COME.

1225
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
WAS IT A DELUSION?

1226
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
DID THIS PERSON THINK THAT BY

1227
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
DOING THIS, HE WAS RIDDING THE

1228
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
EARTH OF EVIL?

1229
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
THAT IS ONE KIND OF ILLNESS.

1230
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
WAS THIS PERSON IN SOME WAY

1231
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
DEVOID OF EMPATHY BECAUSE OF

1232
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
CHILDHOOD EVENTS OF HIS OWN?

1233
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
DID KILLING HIS MOTHER REALLY

1234
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
PLAY IN TO THIS BECAUSE OF

1235
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
SOME HORRIBLE TURMOIL IN THAT

1236
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
FAMILY?
BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS, THE

1237
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE WILL

1238
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
FIND OUT, I WOULD PREDICT THAT

1239
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
THERE WERE SIGNS.

1240
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
THAT THIS WAS A DEEPLY

1241
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
DISTURBED PERSON AND THAT THE

1242
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
SIGNS SHOULD HAVE OR COULD

1243
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
HAVE BEEN TAKEN MORE

1244
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
SERIOUSLY, BECAUSE WE SEE THAT

1245
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THESE

1246
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
INSTANCES.

1247
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
>> Jon: BUT WHY THE

1248
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
CHILDREN?
I MEAN, THE MOTHER WASN'T EVEN

1249
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
THERE IN THE ROOM.

1250
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
AS STRANGE OR TWISTED AS IT

1251
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
MAY SOUND, I COULD IMAGINE

1252
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
GOING TO THE SCHOOL IF THE

1253
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
MOTHER WAS THERE AND THEN THE

1254
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
CHILDREN BECOME, YOU KNOW,

1255
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
PART OF THIS TERRIBLE SHOOTING

1256
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
GALLERY.

1257
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
BUT SHE APPARENTLY WAS ALREADY

1258
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
DEAD.

1259
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
WHY GO TO HER CLASSROOM?

1260
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
>> IT WOULD ALL BE CONJECTURE

1261
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
AT THIS POINT.

1262
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
SPEAKING FROM A PSYCHODYNAMIC

1263
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
STANDPOINT WHAT YOU HAVE

1264
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
SOMEBODY WHO TAKES HIS

1265
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
MOTHER'S LIFE AND THEN TAKES

1266
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
THE LIVES MOF CHILDREN.

1267
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
WERE HE HERE OR COULD WE SPEAK

1268
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
TO HIS BROTHER WE'D SAY I WANT

1269
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR BROTHER'S

1270
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
CHILDHOOD.

1271
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
WAS IT MARKED BY TERRIBLE

1272
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
PAIN?
IS THIS SOME KIND OF SYMBOL?

1273
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
SYMBOL OF WHAT HE LIVED

1274
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
THROUGH?

1275
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
DID HE HAVE IT IN FOR YOUR

1276
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
MOTHER'S JOB?

1277
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
DID HE FEEL SHE SHOULD HAVE

1278
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO HIM?

1279
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
IRRATIONAL BUT THESE ARE

1280
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
IRRATIONM ACTS THAT STILL YOU

1281
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
CAN WRITE A STORY THAT

1282
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
EXPLAINS WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

1283
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THAT

1284
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
PERSON HAS BEEN THINKING.

1285
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
MY GUESS IS THAT HELED

1286
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
SOME OF THE THOUGHTS BEFORE

1287
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
THIS.

1288
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
AND WE'VE GOT TO GET VERY

1289
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
SERIOUS IN THE COUNTRY ABOUT

1290
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
TAKING THOSE THINGS SERIOUSLY.

1291
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
AND KNOWING WHAT TO DO.

1292
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
WE HAVE TO GET THE WORD OUT

1293
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
ABOUT COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH

1294
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
CENTERS AND POLICE AND THE

1295
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
REST OF IT.

1296
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
>> Jon: MENTAL ILLNESS.

1297
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
DR. KEITH ABLOW, THANK YOU.

1298
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
>> THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

1299
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT MY FRIEND.

1300
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM THE

1301
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
CONNECTICUT POLICE AGAIN AT

1302
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
THE TOP OF HOUR.

1303
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
WE ARE AWAITING A NEWS

1304
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
CONFERENCE WITH THE LATEST

1305
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
INFORMATION.

1306
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
WE'LL HAVE IT FOR YOU LIVE AS

1307
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
SOON AS IT BEGINS.

1308
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Why is it that the
most impressive technology

1309
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
often comes with a set

1310
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
of equally impressive
instructions ?

1311
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Shouldn't something
that's truly advanced,

1312
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
not need much explanation
at all ?

1313
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
With the Nokia Lumia 822
on Verizon,

1314
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
there's not much to learn

1315
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
because it's
powered by Windows...

1316
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
to let you do more than you ever
imagined on your smartphone.

1317
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Exclusively with Data Sense--

1318
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
a feature that makes
the most of your plan.

1319
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Only on Verizon.

1320
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
>> Jon: FOX NEWS ALERT, WE

1321
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
ARE AWAITING AN HOURLY UPDATE

1322
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
ON THE SCHOOL SHOOTING TRAGEDY

1323
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
IN CONNECTICUT.

1324
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
WE KNOW 26 INNOCENT PEOPLE

1325
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
WERE KILLED, 20 INSIDE THE

1326
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
SCHOOL.

1327
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
18 DIED AT THE SCHOOL.
TWO WERE TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL

1328
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
AND DIED THERE.

1329
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
STEVE, A FORMER POLICE

1330
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
DETECTIVE, A SCHOOL SECURITY

1331
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
EXPERT JOINS US NOW.

1332
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
HOW DO YOU STOP SOMETHING LIKE

1333
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
THIS?

1334
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
>> WE HAVE TO REVIEW THE

1335
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
CURRENT SYSTEM.
IT'S NOT WORKING.

1336
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
WE ARE PUTTING THIS IN THE

1337
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
BRAINS OF INDIVIDUALS, TO

1338
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
COMMIT THESE CRIMES.

1339
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,

1340
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
AT THIS LEVEL WITH CHILDREN

1341
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
THAT YOUNG ARE SOFT TARGETS.

1342
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
EVERY SCHOOL ACROSS AMERICA IS

1343
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
A SOFT TARGET.

1344
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
WE NEED TO REVAMP THE SYSTEM.

1345
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
IF WE HAVE TO PUT A POLICE

1346
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
OFFICER IN EVERY SCHOOL, WE

1347
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
NEED TO DO THAT.
WE NEED TO TRAIN OUR TEACHERS.

1348
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
THEY ARE THE FIRST LINE OF

1349
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
DEFENSE.
WE NEED THEM TO STEP UP AND

1350
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
ANSWER FOR THE YOUNG CHILDREN.

1351
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
OLDER PEOPLE, WE CAN TELL

1352
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
THEM.

1353
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
BUT THE CHILDREN HAVE SEEN

1354
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
DOZEN OF FATAL SHOOTINGS, NONE

1355
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
OF THEM REAL.
THEY ARE OCCURRING ON TV.

1356
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
THEY HAVEN'T GOT THE CONCEPT.

1357
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
IT'S MANY YEARS BEFORE THE

1358
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
EFFECTS SET IN ON THEM.

1359
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
>> THE SHOOTERN'T GO IN A

1360
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
POLICE DEPARTMENT, DOESN'T GO

1361
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
TO A MILITARY BASE.

1362
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
HE GOES TO WHERE THERE ARE

1363
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
ABSOLUTELY UNPROTECTED

1364
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
INDIVIDUALS, UNABLE TO FIGHT

1365
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
BACK.

1366
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
>> COWARDLY ACT.

1367
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE

1368
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
SET UP SO THIS TYPE OF THING

1369
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
CAN OCCUR.

1370
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
WE HAVE SEEN THIS TIME AND

1371
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
TIME AGAIN.

1372
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
THE SCHOOL TEACHERS,

1373
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
EDUCATORS, RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT

1374
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
ON THEIR MIND.
IT'S NOT ON THEIR MIND THAT

1375
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
THEY WILL HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL

1376
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
AND DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THE

1377
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
CHILDREN'S LIVES.

1378
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
>> THE WEBSITE SAID THEY LOCK

1379
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
IT DOWN AT 9:30.

1380
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
THE SHOOTING HAPPENED AT 9:40.

1381
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
MAYBE A SLIGHT SLIP IN

1382
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
BROTHERS AND MAYBE NOT.

1383
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
APPARENTLY THE SHOOTER WAS A

1384
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
SON OF ONE OF THE PEOPLE.

1385
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH WHOEVER

1386
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
OPERATES THE BUZZER TO LET

1387
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
THEM IN.

1388
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
>> AND A SOFT TARGET, SUCH AS

1389
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
THE SCHOOL, I WOULD IMAGINE

1390
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET

1391
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
IN, YOU ARE GOING TO GET IN.

1392
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
MORE SECURITY, MORE

1393
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
TECHNIQUES, IT'S GOT TO BE

1394
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
EVALUATED.

1395
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
IT WILL HAVE TO BE AT THE

1396
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
HIGHER LEVEL.

1397
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
PUT TOGETHER A PANEL OF

1398
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
EXPERTS REVIEW THIS OVER ONE

1399
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
PERIOD.

1400
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
THIS REPORT IS GOING TO BE

1401
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
EXTENSIVE.
>> Jon: I BELIEVE IT WAS

1402
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR

1403
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
RUDY GIULIANI SAID EVEN IF YOU

1404
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
HAVE ARMED GUARDS AT THE

1405
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
SCHOOL YOU'D PROBABLY WIND UP

1406
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
DRIVING THE SUSPECT TO SOME

1407
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
OTHER PLACE, WHERE THERE ARE

1408
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
NO ARMED GUARDS TOX A SHOPPING

1409
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
MALL OR A PUBLIC PARK OR

1410
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

1411
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
>> WHAT YOU MIGHT DO IF YOU

1412
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
HAD AN ARMED SECURITY LAW

1413
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONAL I

1414
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
WOULD SAY THAT WOULD ENGAGE

1415
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
HIM, IT WOULD GIVE

1416
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
NOTIFICATION TO THE SCHOOL AND

1417
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
WE COULD PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

1418
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
LOCK DOWN, GET THE DOORS

1419
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
LOCKED.
YOU CAN'T, I DON'T CARE HOW

1420
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
POWERFUL THE WEAPON YOU HAVE,

1421
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
YOU WON'T SHOOT A LOCK OFF THE

1422
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
DOOR.

1423
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
SHUT THE DOORS HAVE THE BAR

1424
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
INTERIOR, KEEP THE KIDS ON

1425
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
LOCKDOWN UP AGAINST THE WALL.

1426
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
LIGHTS OFF.
MOVE TO ANOTHER CLASSROOM.

1427
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
THE MORE TIME WE HAVE, THE

1428
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
MORE TIME TO GET LAW

1429
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
ENFORCEMENT THERE, WHEN THE

1430
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
SECONDS COUNT IT TAKES US

1431
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
MINUTES TO GET THERE.

1432
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
>> Jon: I REMEMBER BEING ON

1433
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
THE AIR IN THE 9/11 ATTACKS

1434
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
THINKING THIS IS A DAY THAT

1435
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
EVERYTHING CHANGE CHANGES IN THS

1436
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
COUNTRY.
IT REALLY DID.

1437
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
YOU LOOK AT CREATION OF TSA

1438
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
AND THE WARS THAT CAME AFTER.

1439
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
IS THIS EVENT SOMETHING THAT

1440
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
IS GOING TO BRING ABOUT

1441
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
MONUMENTAL CHANGES, WHETHER

1442
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
THEY ARE EFFECTIVE OR NOT, IN

1443
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
SCHOOL SECURITY?
>> I AM HOPING THAT IT IS.

1444
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I BELIEVE IT IS GOING TO

1445
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
PROMPT SOME CHANGES;  IS SUCH

1446
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
AS, 9/11.

1447
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I AM FEELING THE EMOTIONAL

1448
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
EFFECTS OF WHAT I FELT ON

1449
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
9/11.

1450
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
IT SPENT A WEEK DOWN THERE.

1451
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
IT WILL PROFIT CHANGE.

1452
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
JUST LIKE WE HAD VERY LENGTHY

1453
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
STUDY, WITH VIRGINIA TECH.

1454
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
THIS IS ALSO -- THEY WILL BE

1455
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
THERE FOR A LONG TIME AND THEY

1456
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
MAY NEVER GO BACK AND OPEN THE

1457
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
SCHOOL UP.
>> Jon: BUT THE WORLD HAS

1458
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
ALWAYS KNOWN MAD MEN.

1459
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
IF THERE ARE ALWAYS MAD MEN IN

1460
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
THE FUTURE, THEY WILL ALWAYS

1461
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
FIND A WAY TO INFLICT CARNAGE,

1462
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
ARE THEY NOT?

1463
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
>> BEYOND COMPREHENSION,

1464
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
BEYOND EEL.
WE CAN LEARN FOR IT.

1465
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
YES, THEY WILL.

1466
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
IF WE PROTECT OURSELVES.

1467
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
REASON, OUR SCHOOLS, EDUCATORS

1468
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
ARE THE FIRST LINE.

1469
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
IF WE DON'T HAVE THE LAW

1470
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
ENFORCEMENT THERE.

1471
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
EVERY SCHOOL ACROSS THE NATION

1472
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
HAS POLICY IN PLACE.

1473
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

1474
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
IT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED,

1475
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
REVAMPED AND IMPROVED.

1476
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
WE HAVE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN

1477
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
AGAIN.

1478
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
>> Jon: BUT THAT IS EASER IS

1479
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
SAID THAN DONE, ISN'T IT?

1480
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
>> I KNOW.

1481
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
IT'S NOT A SOLUTION THAT WILL

1482
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
OCCUR OVERNIGHT.

1483
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
LENGTHY SOLUTION OVER TIME.

1484
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
THERE WILL PROBABLY BE MORE

1485
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
MASS SHOOTINGS BETWEEN NOW AND

1486
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
WHEN WE FIND A BETTER WAY.

1487
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
>> Jon: YOU CAN'T PUT POLICE

1488
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
OFFICERS FULL-TIME AROUND THE

1489
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
CLOCK IN EVERY SCHOOL IN

1490
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
AMERICA, CAN YOU?

1491
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
>> WE HAVE SOME SCHOOLS THAT

1492
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
DO THAT.

1493
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
WHO WOULD THINK NEWTOWN,

1494
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
CONNECTICUT, SUBURBAN

1495
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
COMMUNITY.

1496
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
>> Jon: ONE VIOLENT CRIME IN

1497
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
THE LAST YEAR, WE'RE TOLD.

1498
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
>> WE AREN'T PREPARED AS A

1499
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
SOCIETY TO DEAL WITH CARNAGE.

1500
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO DEAL

1501
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
WITH THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE.

1502
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
WHEN IT HAPPENS, WHAT HAPPENS,

1503
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
MOST OF THE PEOPLE FREEZE.

1504
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
LOOK AT THE SUBWAY KILLINGS.

1505
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
THE PEOPLE HAD NO CLUE WHAT

1506
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE IN NEW

1507
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
YORK CITY.

1508
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: JUST SO OUR VIEWERS

1509
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
KNOW WE ARE STILL WAITING A

1510
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
NEWS CONFERENCE EXPECTED NOW

1511
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR.

1512
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
FROM THE STATE POLICE IN

1513
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, WHERE

1514
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
THE TERRIBLE SHOOTING

1515
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
HAPPENED.
THEY HAVE BEEN UPDATING

1516
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
REPORTERS FAIRLY REGULARLY

1517
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON.

1518
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
AFTER A MORNING IN WHICH THERE

1519
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
WAS PRECIOUS LITTLE

1520
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT

1521
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
HAPPENED THERE.

1522
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
THE EARLY REPORTS INDICATED

1523
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
THAT THREE PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE

1524
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
BEEN SHOT AND TAKEN TO THE

1525
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
HOSPITAL.

1526
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
BUT THAT THERE WAS NO

1527
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
INDICATION THAT BLOODBATH WAS

1528
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
AS SEVERE AS IT WAS.

1529
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
SO IF YOU WERE RUNNING THINGS

1530
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
AT THAT SCHOOL, STEVE, WHAT DO

1531
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
YOU DO WHEN IT FINALLY OPENS

1532
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
UP PRESUMING IT DOES AGAIN?

1533
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
>> BELIEVE YOUR EYES AND EARS

1534
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
BUT WHEN YOU HEAR GUNSHOTS OR

1535
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
IF YOU SEE -- I CAN'T

1536
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
COMPREHEND HE WASN'T AT SOME

1537
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
POINT OBSERVED BY SOMEONE

1538
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
WALKING IN TO THAT SCHOOL.

1539
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
>> YEAH.

1540
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
>> CALLING AN ALARM.

1541
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
BELIEVE EYES AND EARS.

1542
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
IF YOU HEAR GUNSHOT RUN FROM

1543
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
THE CARNAGE.

1544
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
THE FATALITY DID OCCUR IN ONE

1545
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
CLASSROOM.

1546
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
DISTURBING AS THIS IS.

1547
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
>> Jon: THAT I BELIEVE IS

1548
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, THE FORMER

1549
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
ATTORNEY GENERAL IN

1550
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
CONNECTICUT WHO ARRIVED AT THE

1551
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
PODIUM.

1552
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
THE OTHERS, I'M NOT FAMILIAR

1553
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
WITH AT THIS POINT.
WE ARE ALSO EXPECTING THAT WE

1554
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
WILL HEAR SOMETHING NEW FROM

1555
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
POLICE ABOUT THIS INCREDIBLE

1556
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
TRAGEDY.
ONCE AGAIN, 20 CHILDREN

1557
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
MURDERED IN THEIR CLASSROOM.

1558
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
SIX ADULTS AS WELL.

1559
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUEBE TO

1560
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
BRING YOU
