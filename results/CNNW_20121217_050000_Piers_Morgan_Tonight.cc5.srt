ANOTHER PARENT OR ANOTHER TOWN

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
FROM THE GRIEF THAT'S VISITED

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
TUCSON AND AURORA AND OAK CREEK

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000

COLUMBINE TO BLACKSBURG BEFORE

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
THAT, THEN SURELY WE HAVE AN

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
OBLIGATION TO TRY.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
IN THE COMING WEEKS, I'LL USE

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE HOLDS

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000

HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, TO PARENTS

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
AND EDUCATORS, IN AN EFFORT

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
AIMED AT PREVENTING MORE

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS, BECAUSE

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
WE CAN'T ACCEPT EVENTS LIKE THIS
AS ROUTINE.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
ARE WE REALLY PREPARED TO SAY

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
THAT WE'RE POWERLESS IN THE FACE

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
OF SUCH CARNAGE?

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
THAT THE POLITICS ARE TOO HARD.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
ARE WE PREPARED TO SAY THAT SUCH

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
VIOLENCE VISITED ON OUR CHILDREN

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR IS

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
SOMEHOW THE PRICE OF OUR

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
FREEDOM?

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
YOU KNOW, ALL THE WORLD'S

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
RELIGIONS, SO MANY OF THEM

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
REPRESENTED HERE TODAY, START

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
WITH A SIMPLE QUESTION.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
WHY ARE WE HERE?

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
WHAT GIVES OUR LIFE MEANING?

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
WHAT GIVES OUR ACTS PURPOSE?

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
WE KNOW OUR TIME ON THIS EARTH

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
IS FLEETING.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
WE KNOW THAT WE WILL EACH HAVE

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
OUR SHARE OF PLEASURE AND PAIN,

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THAT EVEN AFTER WE CHASE AFTER

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
SOME EARTHLY GOAL, WHETHER IT'S

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
WEALTH OR POWER OR FAME OR JUST

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
SIMPLE COMFORT, WE WILL, IN SOME

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
FASHION, FALL SHORT OF WHAT WE

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
HAD HOPED.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
WE KNOW THAT NO MATTER HOW GOOD

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
OUR INTENTIONS, WE'LL ALL

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
STUMBLE SOMETIMES IN SOME WAY.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
WE'LL MAKE MISTAKES, WE'LL

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
EXPERIENCE HARDSHIPS, AND EVEN

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO DO THE

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
RIGHT THING, WE KNOW THAT MUCH

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
OF OUR TIME WILL BE SPENT

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
GROPING THROUGH THE DARKNESS, SO

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
OFTEN UNABLE TO DISCERN GOD'S

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
HEAVENLY PLANS.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING WE CAN BE

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
SURE OF, AND THAT IS THE LOVE

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
THAT WE HAVE.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
FOR OUR CHILDREN, FOR OUR

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
FAMILIES, FOR EACH OTHER.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
THE WARMTH OF A SMALL CHILD'S

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
EMBRACE, THAT IS TRUE.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
THE MEMORIES WE HAVE OF THEM,

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
THE JOY THAT THEY BRING, THE

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
WONDER WE SEE THROUGH THEIR

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
EYES, THAT FIERCE AND BOUNDLESS

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
LOVE WE FEEL FOR THEM, A LOVE

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
THAT TAKES US OUT OF OURSELVES

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
AND BINDS US TO SOMETHING

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
LARGER.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
WE KNOW THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
WE KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS DOING RIGHT

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
WHEN WE'RE TAKING CARE OF THEM.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
WHEN WE'RE TEACHING THEM WELL.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
WHEN WE'RE SHOWING ACTS OF

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
KINDNESS.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
WE DON'T GO WRONG WHEN WE DO

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
THAT.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
THAT'S WHAT WE CAN BE SURE OF,

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU, THE PEOPLE

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
OF NEWTOWN, HAVE REMINDED US.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THAT'S HOW YOU'VE INSPIRED US.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
YOU REMIND US WHAT MATTERS.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
AND THAT'S WHAT SHOULD DRIVE US

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
FORWARD IN EVERYTHING WE DO FOR

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
AS LONG AS GOD SEES FIT TO KEEP

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
US ON THIS EARTH.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
LET THE LITTLE CHILDREN COME TO

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
ME, JESUS SAID, AND DO NOT

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
HINDER THEM, FOR TO SUCH BELONGS

>> ON BEHALF OF THE NEWTOWN

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
CLERGY ASSOCIATION, WE ARE SO

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
GRATEFUL TO OUR PRESIDENT FOR

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
SPENDING TIME WITH US AND FOR

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
REMINDING US THAT WE ARE NOT

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
ALONE IN THIS TIME OF TRAGEDY,

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THAT THERE'S NOT JUST A COUNTRY

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
STANDING BEHIND US, THAT THERE'S

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
A WORLD STANDING BEHIND US.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
THOSE WORDS I KNOW AS DIFFICULT

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
AS THEY WERE TO HEAR FOR SOME,

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
BROUGHT MUCH CONSOLATION TO ALL.

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I WANT TO THANK OUR GOVERNOR AND

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
ALL THE STATE OFFICIALS WHO HAVE

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
BEEN BY OUR SIDE SINCE DAY ONE.

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
THEY HAVE BEEN A REMARKABLE

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
REMINDER TO US OF THEIR HUMANITY

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
AND THEIR CARE FOR US.

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
BUT MOST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
AN INCREDIBLE FIRST-SELECT WOMAN

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
WHO'S LED US THROUGH THE MOST

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
DARK PERIODS OF OUR LIVES.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
IN THE STORMS OF THE PAST YEARS

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
RAVAGED OUR COMMUNITY WITHOUT

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
POWER FOR DAYS, I THOUGHT THOSE

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
WERE THE HARDEST DAYS OF PAT'S

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
LIFE, BUT WHEN I SAW HER FRIDAY

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
IN FRONT OF SANDY HOOK SCHOOL, I

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
REALIZED THAT SHE'D MET THE MOST

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
DARK DAYS.

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
PAT, TO YOU, TO DR. ROBINSON, WE

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
THANK YOU FOR BEING LEADERS TO

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
US THROUGH THESE DIFFICULT

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
TIMES.

146
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
AND NOW THIS FINAL PART OF OUR

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
PRAYER IS FOR US, THE PEOPLE OF

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
NEWTOWN.

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
>> THESE ARE THE WORDS OF THE

150
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
APOSTLE PAUL AS HE WRITES TO THE

151

CHURCH AT ROME.

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
WHAT THEN SHALL WE SAY IN

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
RESPONSE TO THIS, IF GOD IS FOR

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
US, WHO CAN BE AGAINST US?

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
HE WHO DID NOT SPARE HIS OWN

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
SON, BUT GAVE HIM UP FOR ALL OF

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
US, HOW WILL HE NOT ALSO ALONG

158

WITH HIM GRACIOUSLY GIVE US ALL

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
THINGS?

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
WHO WILL BRING ANY CHARGE

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
AGAINST THOSE WHOM GOD HAS

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
CHOSEN, THAT IS GOD WHO

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
JUSTIFIES, WHO IS HE THAT

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
CONDEMNS?

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
CHRIST JESUS WHO DIED, MORE THAN

166
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
THAT WHO WAS RAISED TO LIFE, WAS

167
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD AND IS

168
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
ALSO INTERCEDING FOR US.

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
WHO SHALL SEPARATE US FROM THE

170
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
LOVE OF CHRIST, SHALL TROUBLE OR

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000

TO BE SLAUGHTERED.

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
KNOW IN ALL THESE THINGS WE ARE

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
MORE THAN CONQUERERS THROUGH HIM

WHO LOVED US, FOR I AM CONVINCED

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
SHE WAS EXTREMELY CLOSE TO HER

559
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
SIBLINGS THAT ARE SITTING WITH

560
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
ME, HER COUSINS, AND LOVED THEM

561
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
DEARLY.

562
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
AND WANTED TO BE A TEACHER FROM

563
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
THE TIME SHE WAS 3.

564
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
THAT'S ALL SHE EVER WANTED TO

565
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
DO.

566
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
SHE JUST LOVED HER KIDS.

567
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
SHE JUST TALKED ABOUT THEM ALL

568
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
THE TIME WITH SUCH FONDNESS AND

569
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
CARING, AND SHE JUST ADORED

570
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
THEM.

571
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND

572
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
SHE DID EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO

573
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
PROTECT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

574
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
THEM.

575
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
>> WHAT SHE DID WAS INCREDIBLY

576
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
HEROIC, AND SHE SAVED MANY LIVES

577
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
WITH HER ACTIONS.

578
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
KNOWING HER, AS HER MOTHER, AS

579
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
WELL AS ANYBODY IN THE WORLD

580
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
KNEW HER, DID IT SURPRISE YOU

581
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
THAT SHE WAS SO COURAGEOUS IN

582
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
SUCH A TERRIFYING MOMENT?

583
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
>> NOT AT ALL.

584
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
SHE WAS TRULY SELFLESS.

585
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
SHE WOULD NOT HESITATE TO THINK

586
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
TO SAVE ANYONE ELSE BEFORE

587
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
HERSELF, AND ESPECIALLY

588
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
CHILDREN.

589
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
SHE LOVED THEM MORE THAN LIFE,

590
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
AND SHE WOULD DEFINITELY PUT

591
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
HERSELF IN FRONT OF THEM ANY

592
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
DAY, ANY DAY AND FOR ANY REASON.
IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ANYBODY THAT

593
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
KNOWS VICKI THAT SHE DID THIS.

594
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
>> CARLY, VICKI WAS YOUR SISTER,

595
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
YOU WERE ALL VERY CLOSE, AS YOUR

596
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
MOTHER JUST SAID.
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A TERRIBLE,

597
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
TORRENTIAL LOSS, YOU MUST BE

598
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
GRIEVING HORRIBLY, YET AT THE

599
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
SAME TIME HEARING THE PRESIDENT

600
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
OF THE UNITED STATES TALK ABOUT

601
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
YOUR SISTER AS A HERO, IT MUST

602
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
HAVE BEEN VERY MOVING TO YOU.

603
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
>> IT WAS VERY MUCH.

604
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I APPRECIATE ALL HIS KIND WORDS

605
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
THAT HE DID SAY ABOUT MY SISTER.

606
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
SHE WAS A HERO, AND SHE STILL

607
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
IS.

608
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
>> WHAT KIND OF PERSON WAS SHE,

609
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
CARLEE?

610
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
>> SHE WAS SO CARING.

611
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
SHE PUT ANYBODY ELSE BEFORE HER.

612
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
SHE WANTED THE BEST FOR
EVERYONE.

613
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
SHE JUST LOVED LIFE, AND SHE

614
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
LOVED TEACHING.

615
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
>> AND JILLIAN, YOU'RE ALL

616
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
WEARING GREEN BECAUSE THAT WAS

617
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
VICKI'S FAVORITE COLOR, AND I

618
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
HEARD YOU SAY THIS MORNING THAT

619
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
WHEN IT SNOWED, YOU FELT IT WAS

620
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
IN SOME WAY A SIGNAL FROM YOUR

621
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
SISTER.

622
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
>> IT WAS.

623
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
IT'S LIKE HER LOOKING DOWN AT US

624
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
AND LETTING US KNOW THAT SHE'S

625
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
HERE WITH US AND SHE LOVED THE

626
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY.

627
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
SHE LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT,

628
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
THE SNOW THAT COMES WITH IT, SO

629
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
WHEN IT STARTED TO HAIL, THE

630
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
THREE OF US KNEW IT WAS OUR

631
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
SISTER SAYING THAT I'M HERE WITH

632
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
YOU GUYS, EVEN THROUGH ALL OF

633
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
THIS.

634
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
GREEN IS HER FAVORITE COLOR.

635
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
>> I'M SORRY.

636
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
>> WE JUST WANTED TO WEAR THE

637
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
GREEN TO SHOW HOW MUCH WE LOVE

638
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
HER AND HONOR HER FOR IT.

639
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
>> CARLOS, YOU WERE VICKI'S

640
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
BROTHER.

641
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
WHEN YOU HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED

642
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
AT THE SCHOOL, IT MUST HAVE

643
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
BEEN, I IMAGINE, THE WORST

644
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE.

645
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
TRY AND SUM UP FOR ME WHAT IT'S

646
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
BEEN LIKE FOR YOU AS A FAMILY

647
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
SINCE THIS DREADFUL, DREADFUL

648
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
MOMENT HAPPENED.

649
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
>> IT'S JUST BEEN HORRIBLE.

650
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
THERE'S BEEN SO MANY PEOPLE HERE

651
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
TO SUPPORT US, AND I REALLY

652
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
THINK THAT SHE WANTED US TO COME

653
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
BACK TOGETHER.

654
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
AND WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN CLOSE, BUT

655
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
SHE'S JUST GOING TO BRING US

656
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
CLOSER, AND I KNOW WE'LL ALWAYS

657
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
REMEMBER HER FOR THIS.

658
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
>> AND CARLOS, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THE WAY THE COMMUNITY HAS

659
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
RALLIED TOGETHER?

660
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
THE PRESIDENT NOTICED THIS,

661
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
YOU'VE COME TOGETHER AS A

662
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
COMMUNITY, NOT JUST THOSE WHO

663
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
HAVE LOST PEOPLE, BUT JUST THE

664
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
WHOLE COMMUNITY.

665
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
AND YOU'VE BEEN JOINED BY

666
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
AMERICA, I THINK, THAT'S BEEN

667
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
SHATTERED BY WHAT'S HAPPENED,

668
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
FROM THE PRESIDENT DOWN.

669
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN

670
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
WITH NEWTOWN NOW?

671
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
HOW WILL THEY RECOVER FROM THIS?

672
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
>> I DON'T THINK IT WILL EVER BE

673
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
A FULL RECOVERY.

674
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I KNOW THAT THESE 27 PEOPLE THAT

675
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
LOST THEIR LIVES WILL BE

676
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
REMEMBERED AND WILL BE MISSED TO

677
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
THE FULLEST, AND I JUST -- IT'S

678
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
JUST SO THANKFUL TO KNOW THAT

679
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
EVERYONE IN STRATFORD HAS BEEN

680
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
TOUCHED BY HER LIFE SOMEHOW AND

681
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
CAME HERE TO CELEBRATE HER LIFE.

682
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
>> I UNDERSTAND, DONNA, THAT YOU

683
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
AND CARLEE MET WITH THE
PRESIDENT TODAY.

684
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT?

685
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
>> WE ALL MET WITH THE PRESIDENT

686
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
TODAY.

687
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
IT WAS -- HE WAS VERY, VERY

688
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
CARING AND VERY SUPPORTIVE AND

689
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
TOLD US HE KNEW ALL ABOUT VICKI

690
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
AND WHAT SHE DID AND WHAT A HERO

691
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
SHE WAS.

692
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
AND SHE WAS JUST VERY, VERY KIND

693
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
TO US AND GAVE US THE TIME WE

694
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
NEEDED WITH HIM, AND IT WAS --

695
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
IT WAS VERY COMFORTING.

696
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
>> AND JAMES, YOU WERE VICKI'S

697
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
COUSIN, YOU'RE ALSO A POLICE

698
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
OFFICER.

699
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
IT WAS VERY NOTICEABLE IN THE

700
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH TONIGHT THAT

701
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
HE SEEMS, ALTHOUGH HE NEVER

702
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
MENTIONED THE WORD GUNS, HE'S

703
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
DETERMINED TO DO WHATEVER HE

704
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
CAN, HE SAID, TO TRY AND PREVENT

705
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
ANOTHER SHOOTING TRAGEDY LIKE
THIS.

706
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
AND MANY ARE TAKING THIS TO MEAN

707
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
GUN CONTROL, WHATEVER IT MAY BE.

708
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION AS A
POLICEMAN TO WHAT HE WAS SAYING

709
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
THERE?

710
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
>> I GOT TO BE HONEST, I DIDN'T

711
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
SEE OR HEAR HIS SPEECH YET.

712
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
WE -- AFTER WE MET WITH HIM, HE

713
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
WAS JUST LOVE AND SUPPORT FROM

714
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
HIM WAS COMFORTING FOR THE

715
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
FAMILY.

716
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I GOT THE FAMILY BACK HERE TO

717
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
STRATFORD.

718
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
TO TRY AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,

719
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
JUST AS ANY OTHER ISSUE, I WOULD

720
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
HAVE TO SAY AWARENESS,

721
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
AWARENESS, AWARENESS.
FRIENDS, FAMILY, GUN SUPPORTERS,

722
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
PEOPLE THAT OPPOSE GUNS, JUST

723
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
AWARENESS.
AND BEING AWARE OF YOUR

724
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
SURROUNDINGS.

725
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
>> I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL

726
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
FOR --

727
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO

728
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
SAY.

729
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
>> LISTEN, I DON'T WANT TO PRESS

730
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
YOU ON THIS.
IT'S NOT THE TIME FOR YOU AS A

731
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
FAMILY TO CONSIDER THESE THINGS.

732
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
IT WILL BE FOR THE PRESIDENT AND

733
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
POLITICIANS, I THINK, TO DO WHAT

734
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

735
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR

736
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
TAKING THE TIME TO JOIN ME THIS

737
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
EVENING AND JUST TO SEND YOU ON

738
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
BEHALF OF EVERYONE AT CNN AND

739
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
AMERICA THAT'S BEEN THINKING OF

740
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

741
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
VICKI WAS A HEROINE, TRUE

742
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
AMERICAN, YOUR LOSS IS APPALLING

743
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
BUT HER LEGACY AND MEMORY WILL

744
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
LIVE ON FOR A VERY, VERY LONG

745
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
TIME.

746
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

747
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
>> THANK YOU.

748
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
>> THANK YOU.

749
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
>> BRAVE FAMILY.

750
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I WANT TO BRING YOU WOLF

751
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
BLITZER, WHO'S ON THE SCENE OF

752
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
TONIGHT'S VIGIL.

753
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
WOLF, IT'S A PRETTY UNBEARABLE

754
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
STORY, THIS, TO COVER.

755
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
YOU CAN ONLY BEGIN TO IMAGINE

756
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
WHAT ON EARTH THESE FAMILIES ARE

757
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
GOING THROUGH.

758
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE

759
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH TONIGHT?

760
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
VERY EMOTIONAL, PRETTY

761
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
DETERMINED, AND ALTHOUGH HE

762
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
DIDN'T MENTION THE WORD GUNS,

763
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
PRETTY OBVIOUS, I THINK, HE'S

764
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
GOING TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING

765
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
FAIRLY DRAMATIC TO TRY AND DO

766
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
SOMETHING, AS HE PUT IT, DOING

767
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
NOTHING IS NOT AN OPTION
ANYMORE.

768
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
>> Reporter: HE SAYS HE'S GOING

769
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
TO USE EVERY OPPORTUNITY HE HAS

770
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
WITH THE POWER OF HIS OFFICE,
THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED

771
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
STATES, TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THIS

772
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

773
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
EVEN IF HE CAN SAVE ONE OR TWO

774
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
OR THREE YOUNG KIDS, HE WANTS TO

775
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
DO IT.

776
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
AND IT WAS A CLEAR REFERENCE, I

777
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT,

778
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
PIERS, WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS

779
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
TALKING ABOUT, EVEN THOUGH HE

780
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
DIDN'T SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, WE

781
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
MUST, YOU KNOW, GET NEW GUN

782
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
LEGISLATION TO CONTROL GUNS IN

783
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
THE UNITED STATES, THE ASSAULT

784
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
WEAPONS BAN OR WHATEVER, THAT'S

785
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
CLEARLY WHAT HE'S DRIVING AT AND

786
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
WHAT HE'S GOING TO TRY TO DO.

787
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
WHETHER OR NOT HE SUCCEEDS IS

788
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
ANOTHER MANNER.

789
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
AS YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF
OPPOSITION TO A MUCH GREATER GUN

790
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
CONTROL IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT I

791
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
THINK HE'S GOING TO TRY.

792
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
HE DIDN'T TRY DURING THE FIRST

793
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
FOUR YEARS.

794
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
THERE WERE A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES

795
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
ON HIS AGENDA, INCLUDING A U.S.

796
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
ECONOMY THAT WAS NEAR, NOT ONLY

797
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
RECESSION, BUT POTENTIALLY
ANOTHER DEPRESSION.

798
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
A LOT GOING ON, TWO WARS.

799
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
BUT RIGHT NOW, HAVING JUST BEEN

800
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
REELECTED, HAVING JUST GONE

801
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
THROUGH WHAT WE HEARD ONE OF THE

802
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
MINISTERS SAY, ONE OF THE PEOPLE

803
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
WHO MET WITH HIM, THIS PAST

804
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
FRIDAY WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT WHAT

805
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
HAPPENED AT THAT ELEMENTARY

806
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
SCHOOL HERE IN NEWTOWN,

807
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
CONNECTICUT, THE WORST DAY OF
HIS PRESIDENCY, I THINK THERE'S

808
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
NO DOUBT HE'S GOING TO TRY TO DO

809
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
SOMETHING IN THIS SECOND TERM AS

810
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
FAR AS GUN CONTROL IS CONCERNED.

811
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
THAT WILL BE A PRIORITY.

812
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
HE WANTS TO USE THE OFFICE OF

813
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
THE PRESIDENCY TO TRY TO SAVE

814
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
SOME LIVES, AND I THINK HE'S

815
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
GOING TO DO THE BEST HE CAN ON

816
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
THIS AREA.

817
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'LL SUCCEED,

818
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
BECAUSE THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE,

819
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
AS YOU KNOW, IN THE U.S. SENATE,
U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

820
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
BUT HE'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.

821
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

822
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
AND I THINK HE'S PICKED UP ON

823
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
WHAT'S A NATIONAL MOOD THAT I

824
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
DETECT AFTER THIS PARTICULAR

825
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
HORRIFYING INCIDENT, ONE OF THE

826
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
WORST YOU COULD POSSIBLY
IMAGINE.

827
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I DETECT THERE'S A DIFFERENT

828
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
MOOD ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND ACTION

829
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
HAS TO BE TAKEN.

830
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ARE GOING TO

831
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
DEMAND IT.

832
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
WOLF, FOR NOW, THANK YOU VERY

833
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
MUCH INDEED.

834
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
>>> THE TRAGEDY IN NEWTOWN

835
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
RAISES DIFFICULT AND PAINFUL

836
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000

WHAT HE NOW THINKS.

842
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
THIS IS AMERICA.

843
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
WE DON'T LET FREQUENT HEARTBURN

844
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
COME BETWEEN US
AND WHAT WE LOVE.

845
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
SO IF YOU'RE ONE OF THEM PEOPLE
WHO GETS HEARTBURN

[ Male Announcer ]
ONE PILL EACH MORNING.
24 HOURS. ZERO HEARTBURN.

00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
>>> WITH CANDLES, FLOWERS, AND
CARDS, PEOPLE GATHERED TONIGHT

AT A MEMORIAL FOR THE VICTIMS IN

NEWTOWN.

853
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
WE'RE LEARNING MORE DETAILS

854
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
ABOUT THE GUNMAN, ADAM LANZA.

855
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
JOINING ME IS AMADOR, HE'S

856
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
CONSULTED ON MANY MASS SHOOTINGS

857
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
IN THE PAST.

858
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
WE SPOKE ON FRIDAY.
RIGHT AT THE TOP, I WANT TO TALK

859
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
ABOUT SOMETHING WE DISCUSSED,

860
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
WHICH IS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL
MENTAL ILLNESS THAT THIS YOUNG

861
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
MAN SUFFERED FROM.

862
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
IT'S SUGGESTED THAT IT IS

863
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
POSSIBLY ASPERGERS, A FORM OF

864
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
AUTISM.

865
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
CLARIFY THAT AND CLARIFY WHETHER

866
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
THERE'S ANY REAL SCIENCE THAT
SUGGEST PEOPLE THAT HAVE THAT

867
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
KIND OF CONDITION MIGHT BE

868
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
VIOLENT.

869
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
>> THERE IS NONE.

870
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE

871
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
THAT IF YOU HAVE ASPERGER'S,
YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE VIOLENT

872
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

873
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I GOT SOME E-MAILS AND BLOGS

874
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
AFTER OUR LAST CONVERSATION.

875
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I DIDN'T INTEND TO SAY PEOPLE

876
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
WITH ASPERGER'S LACK EMPATHY,

877
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
THEY LACK THE ABILITY TO JUDGE

878
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
SOCIAL CUES.

879
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I LOOK AT YOU LIKE YOU'RE

880
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
LOOKING AT ME, IT MAY LOOK LIKE

881
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I DON'T HAVE EMPATHY, I WANTED

882
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
TO CLARIFY THAT AS WELL.

883
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
>> MORE AND MORE DETAIL

884
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
EMERGING, NO SIGN OF MOTIVE.

885
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
KILLED HIS MOTHER, WENT TO THE

886
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
SCHOOL AND CLEARLY LOOKS LIKE HE

887
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
PLANNED IT QUITE CAREFULLY.

888
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
THE FBI SEIZED A COMPUTER.

889
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY KNOW IS

890
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
HE WAS PLAYING PRETTY VIOLENT

891
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
VIDEO GAMES, REENACTING BATTLE

892
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
SCENES WITH GRAPHIC CHARACTERS

893
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
AND SO ON.

894
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I WAS DEBATING THIS ON TWITTER

895
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
TODAY, IF YOU'RE WATCHING AND

896
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN ANY OF

897
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
THIS, TELL ME, MANY HAVE BEEN

898
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
STRONG ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS.

899
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
PEOPLE SAYING THERE'S NO LINK

900
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
BETWEEN ANY OF THIS AND ANYONE

901
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
WATCHING VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES,

902
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
BUT HERE'S MY QUESTION.

903
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
IN ALL YOUR EXPERIENCE, IF

904
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
SOMEBODY IS MENTALLY ILL,

905
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
MENTALLY UNSTABLE, VULNERABLE,

906
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
IF YOU LIKE, AND THEY ARE

907
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
WATCHING VERY VIOLENT VIDEO

908
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
GAMES A LOT, CAN IT STIMULATE

909
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
THEM, DOES IT DESENSITIZE THEM,

910
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
CAN IT BE PART OF THE

911
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
PROVOCATION, IF YOU LIKE, FOR

912
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
MAKING THEM GO AND DO AN

913
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
ATROCITY?

914
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S PART OF

915
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
THE PROVOCATION.

916
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
LET ME SAY SOMETHING.

917
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL

918
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
ILLNESS, DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE

919
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
MENTALLY UNSTABLE.

920
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN

921
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
TREATMENT WITH SERIOUS MENTAL

922
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
ILLNESSES LIKES ASPERGER'S,

923
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
SCHIZOPHRENIA, BIPOLAR, ARE

924
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
STABLE, LIVING PRODUCTIVE LIVES,

925
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
ARE WORKING.

926
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT

927
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
THAT.

928
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
WHAT HAPPENS, I LOOK AT THAT

929
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
RESEARCH FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

930
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO BAN --

931
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
>> COLUMBINE ALSO.

932
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
>> THE HEADLINE IS THAT, YES,

933
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
WHEN YOU'RE ENGAGED IN, YOU

934
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
KNOW, VERY VIVID VIDEOS WHERE

935
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
YOU'RE SHOOTING PEOPLE, KILLING

936
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
PEOPLE, WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE

937
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
DESENSITIZED TO WHAT IT MEANS TO
PULL A TRIGGER.

938
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
CERTAINLY, THE SCIENCE THERE IS

939
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
VERY GOOD, BUT A LOT OF THAT

940
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
RESEARCH IS FLAWED IN THAT

941
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
PEOPLE ARE SELECTED NOT -- YOU

942
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
CAN'T KNOW AHEAD OF TIME IF THE

943
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE DRAWN TO THESE

944
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
GAMES ARE ALREADY PEOPLE PRONE

945
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
TO VIOLENCE AND AGGRESSION,

946
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
REGARDLESS OF THE ISSUE OF

947
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
MENTAL ILLNESS.

948
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
>> PEOPLE WHO PLAY THESE GAMES

949
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
ARE PERFECTLY NORMAL, WHATEVER

950
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
NORMAL MEANS THESE DAYS, AND IT

951
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
HAS NO AFFECT ON THEM, I TOTALLY

952
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
ACCEPT THAT.

953
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
ANOTHER ARGUMENT THAT'S BEEN

954
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
RAISING, MORGAN FREEMAN, THE

955
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
ACTOR, BLAMED THE MEDIA FOR ALL

956
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
OF THIS, COPYCAT SYNDROME, THE

957
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
MEDIA, BY MAKING AS HE PUT IT

958
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
ALMOST LIKE GROTESQUE HEROS OF

959
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
THESE PEOPLE BY CONSTANTLY

960
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
NAMING THEM, SOMEHOW PROPAGATE

961
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
THIS ONGOING SITUATION WITH SO

962
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
MANY MASS SHOOTINGS.

963
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
DO YOU THINK HE'S RIGHT?

964
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I MEAN, I DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM

965
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
RULING OUT GUN CONTROL --

966
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
>> I DON'T THINK HE'S RIGHT.

967
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
>> IS HE RIGHT?
>> NO, HE'S NOT.

968
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I'LL BLAME THE MEDIA FOR ONE

969
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
THING ONLY, WHICH IS

970
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
RETRAUMATIZING US.

971
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
DO YOU REMEMBER WITH 9/11 THERE

972
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
WAS A CALL FOR THE MEDIA TO STOP

973
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
SHOWING THE JETS FLYING INTO THE

974
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
BUILDINGS, BECAUSE PSYCHOLOGISTS

975
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
LIKE MYSELF AND OTHERS WERE

976
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
SEEING OUR PATIENTS HAVING VIVID

977
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
FLASHBACKS, NIGHTMARES,

978
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER

979
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
REACTION.

980
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
EXCESSIVE COVERAGE OF THIS CAN

981
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
BE TRAUMATIZING.

982
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I'VE LOOKED AT PICTURES OF DEAD
CHILDREN AND BABIES IN THE CASES

983
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I'VE WORKED ON AND HAD

984
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
NIGHTMARES.

985
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
ONE CASE IN PARTICULAR I STILL

986
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
HAVE FLASHBACKS TO JUST LOOKING

987
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
AT PICTURES, BUT NO, IT DOESN'T

988
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
CAUSE THIS KIND OF THING.

989
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
CAN I SAY ONE THING REALLY,

990
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
REALLY CLEARLY THAT I ONLY

991
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
TOUCHED ON ON FRIDAY, YOUR

992
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
CHANCES OF BEING SHOT AND KILLED

993
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
IN A MASS SHOOTING LIKE THIS ARE

994
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
ACTUALLY LESS THAN BEING STRUCK

995
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
BY LIGHTNING.

996
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULDN'T

997
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
COVER THIS AND TALK ABOUT THIS,

998
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY, MORGAN

999
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
FREEMAN, THIS IS NOT CAUSING --

1000
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
>> I'M HEARING APPARENTLY MORGAN

1001
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
FREEMAN HAS COME OUT AND SAID

1002
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
IT'S A HOAX, ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN

1003
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
RUNNING ALL OVER THE MEDIA FOR

1004
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
THE LAST 24 HOURS.

1005
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
IT MAY BE A HOAX, AS HE APPEARS

1006
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
TO NOW BE CLARIFYING.

1007
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
EITHER WAY, THOUGH, IT'S A

1008
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
DEBATE A LOT OF PEOPLE I'VE BEEN

1009
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
SEEING ON TWITTER, CNN ANCHORS,

1010
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
ANDERSON COOPER AND OTHERS THINK
YOU SHOULDN'T BE NAMING.

1011
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE SHOULD BE

1012
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
THINKING ABOUT QUITE CAREFULLY.
>> IT IS A VALID THING TO BE

1013
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
THINKING ABOUT, BUT THEN YOU

1014
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
TURN TO THE RESEARCH, IF YOU

1015
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
HAVE VIABLE RESEARCH TO LOOK AT,

1016
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
YOU CAN LOOK AT EXPERTS WHO CAN

1017
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
ASSESS THE TRUTHFULNESS OF THE

1018
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
CONCLUSIONS.

1019
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
WE DON'T SEE THAT COVERAGE LIKE

1020
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
THIS CAUSES VIOLENCE.

1021
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
>> FINAL QUESTION, EVERYBODY

1022
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
WANTS TO KNOW THE SAME THING,

1023
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
WHY WOULD A 20-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO

1024
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
JUST SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE BIT

1025
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
OF A LONER, LITTLE BIT STRANGE,

1026
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
BUT NOTHING DANGEROUS AT ALL,

1027
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
WHY WOULD HE GO TO A SCHOOL AND

1028
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
KILL 20, 5, 6, 7-YEAR-OLD KIDS?

1029
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
>> THE PERSON THAT HAS THE

1030
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
ANSWER MAYBE IS ADAM.

1031
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
ONE THING WE KNOW IS PEOPLE WITH

1032
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
MENTAL ILLNESSES AND PEOPLE WHO

1033
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
DON'T HAVE MENTAL ILLNESSES WHO

1034
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
DO THESE THINGS ISOLATE

1035
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
THEMSELVES FIRST.

1036
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BUILD
BRIDGES TO THESE PEOPLE.

1037
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I TELL YOU WHAT, THE PEOPLE WHO

1038
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
ARE VIOLENT AND ARE PRONE TO

1039
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
SUICIDE, IN MY FIELD, WE PREVENT

1040
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ALL THE

1041
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
TIME WHEN WE BUILD A

1042
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PERSON.

1043
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
THEY WILL TALK TO ME, YOU KNOW

1044
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
WHAT, DOC, I'M SO ANGRY I'M

1045
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
THINKING ABOUT KILLING MY

1046

1047

FBI HAVE.

1049
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
>>> WHEN WE COME BACK, WHAT TO

1050
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
DO ABOUT GUNS.

1051
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
IT'S TRULY A QUESTION ABOUT LIFE

1052
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
AND DEATH AND FEELINGS ON BOTH
SIDES ARE VERY MOTIVE.

1053
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I'LL TALK TO BOTH SIDES AFTER

1054
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
THE BREAK.

1055
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000

00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
HIM AT HIS WORD.
THE PRESIDENT, SINCE THIS HAS

1102
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
HAPPENED, HAS CALLED FOR
MEANINGFUL ACTION.

1103
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
HE'S SAYING ALL THE RIGHT

1104
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
THINGS, AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT

1105
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
ALL THE RIGHT THINGS.

1106
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
IT'S UP TO US, THE AMERICAN

1107
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
PUBLIC NOW, INCLUDING ALL THE

1108
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
VICTIMS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED

1109
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
BY THESE TRAGEDIES, TO MAKE SURE

1110
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
HE DOES TAKE THAT ACTION.

1111
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
THOSE ARE THE DOTS THAT NEED TO
BE CONNECTED.

1112
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
THIS IS THE TIME.

1113
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
CHANGE HAS TO HAPPEN.

1114
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
AND THIS REALLY IS A PIVOTAL

1115
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THIS

1116
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
ISSUE, AND YOU CAN JUST SENSE IT

1117
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
WATCHING THIS TONIGHT AND SEEING

1118
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
HOW THAT COMMUNITY IS GRIEVING

1119
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
AND KNOWING HOW OUR WHOLE NATION

1120
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
IS GRIEVING.

1121
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
WE DO THINK THIS IS A TIME FOR

1122
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
CHANGE AND WE DO THINK PRESIDENT

1123
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
OBAMA IS GOING TO LEAD US IN THE

1124
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
RIGHT DIRECTION.

1125
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
>> STEVE, THE NATURE OF THIS

1126
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
DEBATE, I THINK, NEEDS TO BE

1127
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
CRYSTALLIZED AND CLARIFIED.

1128
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
TOO MANY PEOPLE ON EACH SIDES

1129
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
TAKE EXTREME POSITIONS AND PUT

1130
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
WORDS IN THE MOUTH OF THEIR

1131
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
OPPONENTS.
YOU THE REALITY IS THIS, NOBODY

1132
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
IS SUGGESTING A BAN ON ALL GUNS

1133
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
IN AMERICA.

1134
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS

1135
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
ABSOLUTELY PART OF AMERICAN

1136
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
CULTURE AND PEOPLE BELIEVE IN

1137
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
IT.
HOWEVER, THERE ARE LIMITATIONS.

1138
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
THE AMENDMENT TALKS ABOUT A

1139
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
WELL-REGULATED MILITIA.
PEOPLE ARE CALLING OUT FOR

1140
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
TAKING SOME OF THESE WEAPONS

1141
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
AWAY FROM PEOPLE WITH POTENTIAL

1142
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
MENTAL ISSUES.

1143
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
TO ME, THE QUESTION FOR YOU IS

1144
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
IS, THE LAST THREE MASS

1145
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
SHOOTINGS IN THE LAST FOUR

1146
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
MONTHS IN AMERICA, AURORA,

1147
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
OREGON IN THE SHOPPING MALL AND

1148
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
NOW HERE IN NEWTOWN HAVE

1149
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
INVOLVED YOUNG PEOPLE USING THE

1150
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
SAME WEAPON, AR-15

1151
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE WITH

1152
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES.

1153
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
IN AURORA, OVER 100 IN HIS

1154
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
MAGAZINE, WHICH HE COULD FIRE

1155
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
OFF, AND HERE WE SAW UP TO 30,

1156
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
BUT A LOT OF MAGAZINES.

1157
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
HERE'S THE QUESTION, WHY DO YOU

1158
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
FEEL THAT AMERICANS SHOULD HAVE

1159
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
THOSE IF YOUR BELIEF IS THEY

1160
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
JUST HAVE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES?

1161
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
>> WELL, BEFORE I GO ANY

1162
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
FURTHER, PIERS, FIRST, THANKS

1163
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
FOR HAVING ME BACK.

1164
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
WE DID HAVE A HEATED DISCUSSION

1165
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
LAST TIME AND I MUCH APPRECIATE

1166
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
THIS MORE CALM DISCUSSION.

1167
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
SECOND, ON BEHALF OF I'M SURE I

1168
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE BOARD OF

1169
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
MICHIGAN COALITION OF

1170
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS WE OFFER

1171
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
OUR CONDOLENCES FOR THE VICTIMS

1172
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
OF THE FAMILIES.

1173
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
WE ARE ALL ABOUT SAFETY.

1174
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
WE ALL WANT TO BE SAFE AND WE

1175
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
CERTAINLY WANT CHILDREN TO BE

1176
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
SAFE.

1177
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
LIKE I SAID LAST WEEK, WE JUST

1178
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
DISAGREE ON HOW TO GET THERE

1179
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
FROM HERE.

1180
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I WOULD

1181
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
POINT OUT THAT THE SHOOTER IN

1182
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
THE MALL IN OREGON WAS

1183
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
CONFRONTED BY A LEGALLY ARMED

1184
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
CITIZEN WHO POINTED HIS GUN AT

1185
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
THE SHOOTER AND THEN DECIDED NOT

1186
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
TO SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER BECAUSE

1187
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
HE WAS AFRAID OF MISSING AND

1188
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
HITTING BYSTANDERS.

1189
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
HE WAS ACTING VERY RESPONSIBLY.

1190
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
AND THE NEXT SHOT THAT THAT

1191
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
SHOOTER FIRED, THAT THE KILLER

1192
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
FIRED, WAS ON HIMSELF AFTER HE

1193
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
WAS CONFRONTED WITH AN ARMED

1194
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
CITIZEN.

1195
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
SO THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE EXAMPLE

1196
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
OF A RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNER USING

1197
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
A GUN TO SAVE LIVES.

1198
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
>> WELL, HE ACTUALLY DIDN'T USE

1199
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
THE GUN.

1200
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I THINK THE POINT, DAN, UNLESS

1201
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I'M MISTAKEN.

1202
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
YOU TAKE IT UP HERE.

1203
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
BUT I DON'T THINK ANY AMERICAN

1204
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
CITIZEN WITH A LEGAL GUN HAS

1205
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
EVER INTERVENED IN A MASS

1206
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
SHOOTING, CERTAINLY NOT IN THE

1207
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
LAST 30 OR 40 YEARS IN AMERICA.

1208
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
>> ACTUALLY, THEY HAVE.

1209
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
>> BEFORE THIS EVOLVES INTO AN

1210
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
ARGUMENT, I MEAN, AS EASY AS IT

1211
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
IS TO BECOME UNINSPIRED BY A

1212
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
CONVERSATION LIKE THIS AND WHAT

1213
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
YOUR OTHER GUEST IS SAYING, I

1214
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
JUST ENCOURAGE THE AMERICAN

1215
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
PEOPLE TO NOT LOSE THE SENSE OF

1216
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
INSPIRATION IN TERMS OF THE

1217
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
CHANGE THAT WE HAVE THE
POTENTIAL TO ACCOMPLISH.

1218
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
THIS IS NOT THE CONVERSATION

1219
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WANT TO

1220
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
HAVE.

1221
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
THIS IS NOT OUR VISION WHERE THE

1222
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
ANSWER TO VIOLENCE IS MORE

1223
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
VIOLENCE, WHERE THE ANSWER TO

1224
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
GUNS IS MORE GUNS.

1225
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
THERE IS FERTILE GROUND WHERE

1226
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

1227
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
AMERICANS AGREE WITH THINGS LIKE

1228
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS TO MAKE SURE

1229
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
THAT 40% OF ALL GUN SALES THAT

1230
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
ARE NOT CURRENTLY COVERED BY

1231
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS TO PREVENT

1232
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE FROM GETTING

1233
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
GUNS, TO PREVENT CRIMINALS AND

1234
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
DOMESTIC ABUSERS FROM GETTING

1235
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
GUNS, TO CLOSE THAT GAPING HOLE

1236
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
IN OUR SYSTEM.

1237
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
GUN OWNERS, 74% OF NRA MEMBERS

1238
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
SUPPORT SOLUTIONS LIKE THAT.

1239
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES THIS

1240
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
PLAYS OUT AS A POLARIZED

1241
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
POLITICAL DEBATE IN SEGMENTS

1242
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
LIKE THE ONE I WAS PART OF ALSO

1243
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
ON FRIDAY NIGHT, BUT THE REALITY

1244
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
IS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ISN'T

1245
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
POLARIZED.

1246
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
THE ONLY PLACE THIS IS A
POLARIZED POLITICAL DEBATE IS IN

1247
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
CONGRESS.

1248
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
WE NEED TO TAKE THE VOICE OF THE

1249
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO KNOW THAT,

1250
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
AS PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID TONIGHT,

1251
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
WE CAN BE BETTER THAN THIS AND

1252
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
HOLD OUR LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE.

1253
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
>> VERY INTERESTING TO ME.

1254
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
THIS IS ALMOST A MIRROR TRAGEDY

1255
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN BRITAIN IN

1256
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
1996 AND SCOTLAND, 16 YOUNG 5

1257
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
AND 6-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN WERE

1258
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
KILLED.

1259
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
IT WAS THE WORST SHOOTING OF ITS

1260
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
TYPE IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY,

1261
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
AND AS A RESULT, A FULL HANDGUN

1262
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
BAN WAS BROUGHT IN.

1263
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
WHICH WOULD NOT BE APPLICABLE

1264
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
HERE, THERE ARE TOO MANY IN

1265
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
CIRCULATION.

1266
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
BUT WHAT WAS MOST NOTABLE ABOUT

1267
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
THE DEBATE, IT WAS COMPLETELY

1268
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
NON-POLITICAL.

1269
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
MY QUESTION FOR YOU, STEVE, IS

1270
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO BE
POLITICAL?

1271
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
WHY CAN IT NOT JUST BE A

1272
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
BIPARTISAN, ALL ENCOMPASSING,

1273
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
AMERICAN DIALOGUE, WHICH LEADS

1274
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
IN THE END TO PRAGMATIC

1275
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
SOLUTION?

1276
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
>> I AGREE WITH YOUR LAST

1277
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
STATEMENT, ABSOLUTELY, PIERS.

1278
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
IN FACT, OUR GROUP IS A SINGLE

1279
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
ISSUE NON-PARTISAN GROUP.

1280
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
WE HAVE INDEPENDENTS, DEMOCRATS,

1281
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
AND REPUBLICANS IN OUR GROUP AND
ON MEMBERSHIP, MOST ARE ELECTED

1282
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
OFFICIALS.

1283
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
WE ACTUALLY DO TAKE THAT

1284
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
POSITION.

1285
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
>> DO YOU AGREE WITH UNIVERSAL

1286
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS?

1287
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
>> UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS?

1288
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE CRIMINAL

1289
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
BACKGROUND CHECK IN PLACE.

1290
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
>> RIGHT, BUT THAT ONLY APPLIES

1291
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
TO 60% OF GUN SALES.

1292
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
DO YOU AGREE WITH COVERING THE

1293
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
OTHER 40% OF GUN SALES WITH

1294
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS?

1295
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
>> WE AGREE THAT DISQUALIFIED

1296
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
INDIVIDUALS SHOULD NOT HAVE

1297
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
ACCESS TO FIREARMS.

1298
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
>> SO YOU AGREE WITH THE

1299
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS --
>> ARE YOU GOING TO LET ME

1300
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
FINISH?

1301
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
PLEASE, PLEASE.

1302
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
>> LET ME ASK YOU, GIVE ME ONE

1303
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
GOOD REASON WHY THERE SHOULDN'T

1304
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
BE 100% BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ALL

1305
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
GUN TRANSACTIONS IN AMERICA.

1306
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
GIVE ME A GOOD REASON.

1307
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
>> IT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE,

1308
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
PIERS, AS YOU POINTED OUT A

1309
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
MOMENT AGO, TO DO 100%.

1310
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
WE HAVE A LOT OF GUNS IN
CIRCULATION ON EARTH AND IN THE

1311
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
UNITED STATES.

1312
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
WE KNOW THAT GUNS PASS ACROSS

1313
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
BORDERS.

1314
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEW ONES.

1315
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
>> NATIONAL AND STATE BORDERS.

1316
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
>> LET ME FOCUS THE QUESTION

1317
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
MORE SOLIDLY AND REALISTICALLY.

1318
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
NEW GUNS PURCHASED FROM THIS DAY

1319
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
FORWARD, WOULD YOU BE SUPPORTIVE

1320
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
OF 100% REGISTRATION,

1321
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
ACCOUNTABILITY, DATABASE, A

1322
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
NATIONAL DATABASE, AND IF YOU'RE

1323
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
NOT IN FAVOR OF THAT, WHY

1324
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
WOULDN'T YOU BE?

1325
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
>> OR AS CLOSE AS WE CAN GET TO

1326
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
100%, WHICH IS A LOT CLOSER THAN

1327
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
WHERE WE ARE NOW.

1328
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
>> THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN PLACE

1329
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
RIGHT NOW IS A LIST OF THOSE

1330
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
DISQUALIFIED.

1331
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
PERSONALLY, I WOULD SUPPORT THAT

1332
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
BASED ON EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN

1333
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
ABLE TO LEARN IN MY POSITION AS

1334
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
PROFESSOR OF FIREARMS LAW AND IN

1335
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
MY POSITION AS A TRAINER OF

1336
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
CONCEALED PISTOL LICENSES THAT

1337
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
NATIONAL INSTANT CHECK SYSTEM

1338
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
SEEMS TO BE WORKING QUITE WELL.

1339
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I BELIEVE THAT'S ONE AREA

1340
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
EVERYONE AGREES.

1341
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
>> WE SHOULD APPLY TO 100% OF

1342
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
GUN SALES?

1343
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
>> WE HAVE A LIST OF FOLKS WHO

1344
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
ARE DISQUALIFIED WHO HAVE BEEN

1345
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
ADJUDICATED MENTALLY ILL, FELONY

1346
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
RECORDS THAT DISQUALIFY THEM, ET

1347
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
CETERA.

1348
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
THAT SYSTEM SEEMS TO WORK QUITE

1349
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
WELL.

1350
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
>> FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU,

1351
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
STEVE, IS THIS.

1352
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THE LAST

1353
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
THREE MASS SHOOTINGS, AS I SAID,

1354
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
ALL FEATURED AN AR-15 RIFLE

1355
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
AIDED AND ABETTED BY

1356
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES, GIVE ME

1357
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
A REASON WHY YOU ARE COMFORTABLE

1358
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
WITH THOSE WEAPONS STILL BEING

1359
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH

1360
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES IN

1361
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
AMERICA IN PLACES LIKE WALMART.

1362
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
>> FAIR ENOUGH.

1363
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
AND I DON'T KNOW ANY PARTICULAR

1364
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
RETAILER, BUT I WILL SAY WE DID

1365
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
TRY FROM 1994 TO 2004, WE TRIED

1366
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
THE SO-CALLED ASSAULT WEAPONS

1367
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
BAN.

1368
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
IT HAD NO IMPACT ON CRIME THAT

1369
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
ANYONE COULD MEASURE WHATSOEVER,

1370
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
AND THE TRUTH IS SOMETIMES THESE

1371
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
GUNS ARE USED IN VERY POSITIVE

1372
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
WAYS TO SAVE LIVES.

1373
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
THEY ARE FUNCTIONALLY IDENTICAL

1374
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
TO SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS THAT

1375
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
DATE BACK LITERALLY TO THE

1376
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
1800s.

1377
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
A HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINE IS

1378
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
NOTHING BUT A STEEL BOX AND A

1379
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
SPRING.

1380
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
IT'S INCREDIBLY EASY TO MAKE A

1381
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINE.

1382
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANY SUCH BAN

1383
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
WOULD BE INEFFECTIVE.

1384
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
>> THIS IS TOTALLY DISCONNECTED

1385
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
WITH WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

1386
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
WANT AND THE CONVERSATION THAT'S

1387
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
HAPPENING OUT THERE, AND THAT'S

1388
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
WHAT GIVES ME INSPIRATION TO

1389
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS
LIKE THIS.

1390
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC KNOWS WE ARE

1391
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
BETTER THAN THIS.

1392
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
WE DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A

1393
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
SOCIETY WHERE VIOLENCE LEADS TO

1394
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
MORE VIOLENCE AND GUNS LEAD TO

1395
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
MORE GUNS.

1396
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
THAT'S THE CONVERSATION

1397
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS LEADING AND

1398
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO

1399
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
SPEAK UP AROUND.

1400
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
>> GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE.

1401
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
>> WE ALL AGREE WE NEED SAFETY.

1402
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
>> WE'RE ALL AGREED ON THAT.

1403
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
WE WILL CONTINUE THIS DEBATE ON

1404
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
THE SHOW.

1405
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
IT'S BEEN AN IMPORTANT ONE FOR

1406
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
AMERICA.

1407
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
THANK YOU BOTH.

1408
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
>>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID WE

1409
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
CAN'T TOLERATE THIS ANYMORE, BUT

1410
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
WILL THERE BE A CHANGE IN

1411
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
POLICY?
I'LL ASK FRANK BRUNI AFTER THE

1412
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
BREAK.

1413
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
[ Male Announcer ]
THIS IS AMY. AMY LIKES
TO INVEST IN THE MARKET.

1414
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
SHE ALSO LIKES
TO RIDE HER BIKE.

1415
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
SHE KNOWS THE POTENTIAL
FOR MAKING OR LOSING MONEY

1416
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
CAN POP UP ANYTIME.

1417
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
THAT'S WHY SHE TRADES WITH
THE LEADER IN MOBILE TRADING.

1418
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
SO SHE'S ALWAYS READY
TO TAKE ACTION,

1419
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
NO MATTER HOW WILY...

1420
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
OR WEIRD...

1421
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
OR WONDERFULLY
THE MARKET'S BEHAVING...

1422
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
WHICH ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

1423
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.
