used to control high blood sugar
in adults and children

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
EMERGE AS THE HEROES WHO

368
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
CAREFULLY BROUGHT THOSE CHILDREN

369
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
OUT UNDER SOME VERY DIRE

370
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
CIRCUMSTANCES.
FOM LOSE THIS IS OUR SENIOR

371
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT PIERRE

372

373
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
HE JOINS US NOW.

374
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
PIERRE, WHAT DO WE KNOW RIGHT

375
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
NOW ABOUT THE GUNMAN, WE KNOW

376
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
THAT THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE

377
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
GUNMAN, WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE

378
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
WAS ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED?

379
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
>> WE'RE BEING TOLD AT LEAST ONE

380
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
GUNMAN WAS SHOT AND KILLED.

381
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
THEY RECOVERED AT LEAST TWO

382
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
WEAPONS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS

383
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
TRAGIC SHOOTING.

384
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
DAVID, I CAN TELL YOU, I TALK TO

385
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
FEDERAL SOURCES ALL THE TIME.

386
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
THEY'RE DEVASTATED BY THIS

387
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
INFORMATION.

388
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
THEY CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

389
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
THE NOTION OF 27 PEOPLE BEING

390
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
KILLED IN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

391
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
IS SHOCKING.

392
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
MOST OF THEM CHILDREN AND ALSO,

393
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
WE TALKED TO A SECURITY

394
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
CONSULTANT AS WELL, THAT MANY

395
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AS YOU MIGHT

396
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
IMAGINE DON'T HAVE MUCH IN THE

397
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
WAY OF SECURITY AND TYPICALLY

398
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
DON'T HAVE ARMED PERSONNEL ON

399
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
THE SCHOOL ARE YOU GROUNDS.

400
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
>> THE LAST PLACE THAT YOU WOULD

401
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
EXPECT SOMETHING LIKE THIS

402
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
UNFOLD.
IT'S HARD TO SECURE ALL OF OUR

403
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
SCHOOLS IN OUR COUNTRY.

404
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
WE OFTEN ASK THESE QUESTIONS.

405
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING ON

406
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS ONE FOR SOME

407
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
TIME.

408
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NUMBERS

409
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY, THE

410
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
SCOPE AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN

411
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
THIS COUNTRY BEFORE.

412
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
>> YEAH, WE'RE DOUBLE-CHECKING,

413
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
THIS LOOKS TO BE THE WORST

414
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING IN TERMS OF

415
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
NUMBER OF DEAD IN U.S. HISTORY.

416
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
AGAIN, SOURCES SAY THAT THE FBI,

417
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
ATF AND OTHER FEDERAL SOURCES

418
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
ARE ON THE SCENE TO ASSISTS THE

419
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
LOCAL POLICE WHO ARE THE LEAD ON

420
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
THIS CASE AND AGAIN, THEY ARE

421
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
TRYING TO ASSESS THE SITUATION

422
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
AND WE STILL HAVE AN ACTIVE

423
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE

424
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
CHECKING TO SEE IF THERE MIGHT

425
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
BE A SECOND SHOOTER.

426
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
>> PIERRE, STAND BY.

427
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU SHORTLY.

428
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
DIANE SAWYER ON THE WAY FOR

429
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
"WORLD NEWS" THIS EVENING.

430
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
ERIN, I WAS TAKING NOTE OF ONE

431
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
OF THE E-MAILS YOU SENT EARLY.

432
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
AN HOUR AGO, THEY WERE STILL

433
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
SEARCHING CAR TO CAR

434
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
>> IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO

435
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
SEE POLICE OFFICERS IN TACTICAL

436
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
GEAR WITH ASSAULT RIVALS DRAWN

437
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
GOING BUSINESS TO BUSINESS,

438
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
HOUSE TO HOUSE, CAR TO CAR,

439
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
LOOKING FOR ANY EVIDENCE OF

440
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
ANOTHER SHOOTER.
ONE OF THE SUSPECTED GUNMAN IS

441
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
DEAD.

442
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
REPORTS OF ANOTHER.

443
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
POLICE OFFICERS WERE CONDUCTING

444
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
THESE SEARCHES.

445
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
IN MANY CASES, DAVID, WITH

446
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
CHILDREN EVACUATED FROM THE

447
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
SCHOOL JUST 20, 30 YARDS AWAY AS

448
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
PARENTS HAVE COME TO LOCAL FIRE

449
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
HOUSE TO COLLECT THEIR CHILDREN

450
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
AS THEY PASS BY TO LEAVE THE

451
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
SCENE, THEY SAW THESE

452
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
TACTICALICALLY CLAD OFFICERS

453
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
WERE THEIR GUNS DRAWN AND ONE

454
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
FATHER PUT HIS ARMS AROUND HIS

455
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
SON'S EYES TO SHIELD HIS SIGHT.

456
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
>> HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO TALK

457
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
WITH ANY OF THE PARENTS AND HOW

458
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
ARE THE CHILDREN DOING?

459
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
WE HAVE SEEN IMAGES OF THE

460
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
TEACHERS WHO HAVE BEEN SIMPLY

461
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
HEROIC TODAY TAKING THESE

462
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
CHILDREN OUT OF THE SCHOOL?

463
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
>> AT FIRST WORD OF THE SHOOTING

464
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
AT 10 CAN:00 A.M., THE SCHOOL

465
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
DAY WAS FULLY UNDER WAY.

466
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
THE KIDS WERE TOLD TO GRAB A

467
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
BUDDY AND AND WALK QUICKLY.

468
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
WALK TO THE NEARBY FIRE HOUSE

469
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
AND THEY DID IT WITHOUT GRABBING

470
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
ANY OF THEIR BELONGINGS.

471
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GRAB

472
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
THEIR OWN JACKET.

473
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
WEB WE TALKED TO MANY OF THE

474
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
PARENTS, AS YOU COULD IMAGINE,

475
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
THEY SAID THE WORST WENT THROUGH

476
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
THEIR HEAD.

477
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
AS REVERSE 911 ALERT SYSTEM,

478
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
INFORMED PARENTS TO COME TO THE

479
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
FIRE HOUSE TO COLLECT THEIR

480
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
CHILDREN.
ONE WOMAN SAID SHE HAD NO IDEA

481
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
WHAT TO THINK.

482
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
ONE FATHER SAID THAT HE HAD

483
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
NEVER BEEN MORE PANICKED ON THIS

484
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
DRIVE FROM WORK TO GET HIS SON.

485
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
>> WHEN PARENTS GET CALLS LIKE

486
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
THIS, THAT FLASHES UP, PEOPLE

487
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
FEAR THE WORST AND IT WOULD

488
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
APPEAR AS THESE NUMBERS UNFOLD

489
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
TODAY IF YOU'RE JUST TUNING IN.

490
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
THIS IS ABC NEWS LIVE COVERAGE

491
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000

KILLED HIMSELF BUT NOT UNTIL HE

497
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
HAD EXACTED HORRIFIC TERROR

498
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
INSIDE THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

499
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
LEAST 27, THE NUMBER CONTINUES

501

TO GROW THROUGHOUT THE MORNING

502
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
AND MANY OF THE VICTIMS ARE

503
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
BELIEVED TO IN FACT BE CHILDREN

504
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

505
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
AS YOU HEARD AARON REPORT JUST

506
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
MOMENTS, CHILDREN WERE BROUGHT

507
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
OUT, TOLD TO GRAB A FRIEND,

508
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
LEAVE THEIR BELONGINGS ASIDE,

509
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
IT'S A COLD DAY, TEMPERATURES IN

510
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
THE 40s, YOU CAN SEE, THEY DON'T

511
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
HAVE THEIR COATS ON, PARENTS

512
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
WERE ALERTED TO GO TO A NEARBY

513
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
FIRE HOUSE, THE SANDY HOOK FIRE

514
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
HOUSE.

515
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
THAT'S WHERE DAN HARRIS HAS BEEN

516
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
STANDING BE I THINK MORNING.

517
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
DAN, THESE REUNIONS WITH PARENTS

518
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
HAVE TO SOMETHING TO BE WITNESS.

519
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
>> Reporter: THEY ARE.

520
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING A STEADY

521
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
STREAM OF FAMILIES EMERGING FROM

522
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
THIS FIRE HOUSE AND EVERYBODY IS

523
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
TRULY DISTRAUGHT AND SHAKEN.

524
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH ONE

525
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
MOTHER WHO HAD AN 8-YEAR-OLD IN

526
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
THE SCHOOL.

527
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I TALKED TO THE MOTHER AND HER

528
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
8-YEAR-OLD.

529
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
SHE SAID YOU DON'T EXPECT IT TO

530
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
HAPPEN IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

531
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
YOU HEAR THAT ALL THE TIME.

532
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
HAVING COVERED EVENTS LIKE THIS,

533
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
THIS IS A TRULY UNIQUE

534
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
SITUATION, THAT THIS IS A VERY

535
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
SMALL TOWN IN A RURAL AREA, A

536
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
BEAUTIFUL SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND

537
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
TOWN, NOT AT ALL WHAT YOU WOULD

538
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
EXPECT TO SEE ALL OF THESE

539
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
POLICE OFFICERS HERE AND HAVE
ALL OF THIS MAYHEM CARRIED OUT

540
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT.

541
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I TALKED TO THIS 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL

542
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
EVACUATED FROM THIS SCHOOL, SHE

543
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
SAID THEY WERE VERY CALM BUT THE

544
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
STUDENTS WERE DISTRAUGHT AND

545
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
FEAR.
SHE SAID THERE WAS A LOT OF

546
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
CRYING AND SCREAMING.

547
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
SHE DIDN'T HEAR THE GUN SHOTS

548
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
BUT SHE HEARD THE AMBULANCES AND

549
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
SHE WAS VERY SCARED BUT THE

550
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
OTHER STUDENTS WERE EVEN MORE

551
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
SCARED.
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ONE OTHER

552
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
CONVERSATION, DAVID, A MOLT AGO

553
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
WITH A PARENT WHO ARRIVED HERE

554
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
AT THE FIRE HOUSE, SHE DID NOT

555
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
HAVE STUDENTS IN THIS SCHOOL,

556
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
SHE HAD STUDENTS IN ANOTHER

557
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
SCHOOL NEARBY, SHE SAID THAT SHE

558
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
WAS WAITING TO GO PICK UP HER

559
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
CHILDREN FOR TWO HOURS BECAUSE

560
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
SHE SAID, THESE ARE THE LAST TWO

561
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
REMAINING HOURS OF THEIR

562
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
CHILDHOOD, BECAUSE ONCE THEY

563
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
LEARN WHAT HAPPENED HERE, THEIR

564
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
INNOCENCE WILL MOST CERTAINLY BE

565
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
LOST.

566
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
>> WE CAN'T UNDERSCORE THAT

567
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
BEING THE CASE, THE KIND OF

568
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL PLAY OUT

569
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
NOT ONLY IN THE HOUSEHOLDS BUT

570
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT THIS THIS

571
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
IS TAKING PLACE AS THIS HEADLINE

572
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
CONTINUES TO WORSEN.

573
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
AS MORNING TURNS TO AFTERNOON.

574
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
AT LEAST 27 SHOT.

575
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
THAT'S DAN HARRIS REPORTING FROM

576
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
THE SANDY HOOK FIRE HOUSE.

577
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
DAN, THESE CHILDREN WERE AT

578
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
THEIR SCHOOL DESKS, THE SCHOOL

579
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
DAY WAS WELL UNDER WAY, THEY

580
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
WERE IN THEIR CLASS ROOMS WITH

581
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
THEIR TEACHERS, THEY WERE ASKED

582
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
TO SIMPLY GET UP AND WALK OUT.

583
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
AND AS YOU DESCRIBE THE TEARS,

584
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
NOT THE SCREAMING BUT THE TEARS,

585
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
IT WOULD SEEM THAT THESE

586
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
CHILDREN, ALTHOUGH IT'S

587
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, CERTAINLY

588
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
KNEW THE HEAVINESS OF THE

589
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
SITUATION THEY WERE ENDURING.

590
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
>> THEY KNEW THAT SOMETHING BAD

591
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
HAD HAPPENED.
THEY ABSOLUTELY KNEW THAT.

592
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY KNOW NOW AT

593
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
THIS LATE DAY, RELATIVELY

594
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
SPEAKING, I DON'T KNOW IF THEY

595
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
KNOW YET THE GRAVITY OF THIS

596
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
SITUATION.
IT'S JUST TRICKLING OUT THE

597
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
SERIOUSNESS OF THE CRIME

598
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
COMMITTED INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.

599
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW THAT

600
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
INFORMATION WILL BE RELAID TO

601
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
THEM.
YOU SAID IT.

602
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
THESE CONVERSATIONS.

603
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
DIVOT CONVERSATIONS PARENTS WILL

604
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
NOW HAVE TO SAY WITH CHILDREN

605
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE THIS

606
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
SCHOOL.

607
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
UNIMAGINABLY HARD CONVERSATION.

608
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
THERE ARE THE PARENTS WHO AREN'T

609
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
ABLE TO PICK UP THEIR CHILDREN

610
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
NOW.
THE PARENTS WHO AREN'T GOING TO

611
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
BE WORST POSSIBLE AT ALL, THEIR

612
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
CHILDREN WERE IN FACT LOST

613
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.

614
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
THAT DRAMA IS UNFOLDING AS WE

615
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
SPEAK.
IN A BUCOLIC LITTLE TOWN.

616
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
>> THE PARENTS ARE WAITING AND

617
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
HOPING THEY'RE NOT ONE OF THE

618
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
PARENTS WHO ARE INFORMED AND OF

619
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
COURSE, THERE WILL BE HUGS

620
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AS KIDS COME

621
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
HOME FROM SCHOOL ELSEWHERE.

622
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
DAN, STICK WITH US.

623
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
THE FIRE HOUSE WEHERE THE

624
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
CHILDREN WERE BROUGHT.

625
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
DAN AS YOU MENTIONED, PARENTS

626
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
DESCRIBING THE SCENE,

627
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
APPRECIATING WHAT THE TEACHERS

628
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
PULLED OFF.

629
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
DIANE SAWYER TALKED WITH SOME

630
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
PARENTS A SHORT TIME AGO AS WE

631
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
WERE ON THE AIR COVERING THIS

632
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
BREAKING STORY.

633
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
VIEWERS JUST TUNING IN, A LITTLE

634
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
BIT OF THE COLOR THE PARENTS

635
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
DESCRIBING THIS SCENE AS IT

636
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
UNFOLDED IN NEWTOWN,

637
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
CONNECTICUT.
>> WE GOT A PHONE CALL THAT

638
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
THERE HAD BEEN A REPORT OF A

639
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
SHOOTING AND THAT ALL SCHOOLS

640
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
WERE IN LOCKDOWN AND IT DIDN'T

641
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
SAY WHAT SCHOOL.

642
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
THEN A NEIGHBOR THEY SAID IT

643
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
HEARD IT WAS SANDY HOOK WHERE

644
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
OUR CHILDREN GOES.

645
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
AS A PARENT I KNOW WHO HAPPENED

646
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
TO BE IN THE BUILDING AT THE

647
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
TIME.

648
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
SHE WAS PRETTY BROKEN UP.

649
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
SHE WAS AT A MEETING WITH THE

650
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
PRINCIPAL.

651
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
SHE HAD STAYED IN THE CONFERENCE

652
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
ROOM AND MY UNDERSTANDING FROM

653
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
HER IS THAT THE PRINCIPAL AND

654
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
OTHER PEOPLE GOT SHOT.

655
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
WHEN THEY WENT OUT INTO THE

656
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
HALLWAY WAND AND SHE WAS THE ONE

657
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
WHO CALLED 911.

658
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
>> I SAW THE FIRST COP CARS

659
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
ROLLING DOWN THERE.

660
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I JUST LITERALLY RAN DOWN THERE.

661
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I GOT PRETTY MUCH UP TO THE

662
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
SCHOOL WITH OTHER PARENTS WHO

663
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
WERE RIGHT ON THE SCENE.

664
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
THEY WERE LEADING THE KIDS OUT

665
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
SINGLE FILE.
I SAW HIM RIGHT AWAY AND JUST

666
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
WENT WITH HIM AT THAT POINT.

667
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
>> HOW SHAKEN WAS EDWIN, WHAT

668
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
DID HE WANT TO TALK TO YOU

669
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
ABOUT?
>> HE DOES NOT REALLY WANT TO

670
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
TALK ABOUT IT.

671
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
HE'S JUST SCARED AND SHAKEN.

672
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
HE SAID THAT HE DIDN'T SEE HE

673
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
HEARD.
HIS FRIENDS AND TEACHER ARE ALL

674
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
OKAY AND SO, RIGHT NOW, WE'RE

675
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
JUST FOCUSED ON COMFORTING HIM.

676
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
>> I HEARD THAT CHILDREN WERE

677
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
TAKEN OUT BLOODY.

678
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
SEVERAL TEACHERS AND MOTHER WHO

679
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
WAS ACTUALLY IN THE SCHOOL SAID

680
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
THAT A MASKED MAN CAME IN AND

681
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
STARTED FIRING.

682
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
>> MY WIFE AND I DROVE RIGHT

683
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
OVER THERE AND WHEN WE ARRIVED,

684
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I WOULD SAY PROBABLY ABOUT 40

685
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
PEOPLE WERE THERE.

686
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
IT BECAME A VERY CHAOTIC

687
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
SITUATION, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE

688
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
EVERYBODY WAS TRYING TO GET
THEIR CHILDREN OUT.

689
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE FIRE

690
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL AND

691
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL TOO

692
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
MUCHERS, I MEAN, I'M JUST SO

693
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
PROUD THE WAY OUR SCHOOL HAS

694
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
RESPONDED TO THIS.

695
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
>> THAT FATHER RIGHT THERE,

696
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
ECHOED WHAT OTHER PARENTS SAID,

697
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
THEY WILL BE HUGGING THEIR

698
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
CHILDREN.
THE CHILDREN WHO DID GET OUT

699
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
ALIVE.

700
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
ONE MOTHER DESCRIBING WHAT SHE

701
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
HAD HEARD.
REPORTS OF A MASKED MAN WHO

702
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
ENTERED THE SCHOOL AND STARTED

703
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
FIRING.

704
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
THERE WERE REPORTS FROM ONE

705
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
PARENT THERE, THAT SOME OF THE

706
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
CHILDREN WERE BROUGHT OUT FROM

707
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
THE SCHOOL, BLOODY AND THIS AS

708
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER ON YOUR

710
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
AT LEAST 27 SHOT AT THIS SCHOOL

711
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
SCHOOL.
A SMALL, CLOSE-KNIT COMMUNITY.

714
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
A NUMBER OF THOSE VICTIMS,

715
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
PERHAPS A MAJORITY OF THEM COULD

716
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
BE CHILDREN AND OF COURSE, WE'LL

00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000

IT WILL BE O FIRST TIME

738
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
HEARING FROM AUTHORITIES IN THAT

739
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
COMMUNITY.

740
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
THE FBI IS ON THE SCENE.

741
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE ARE

742
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
ALSO ON THE SCENE.

743
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
AS WE LOOK AT HELICOPTER SHOTS

744
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
FROM OUR AFFILIATE, SECURITY AT

745
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS NATIONWIDE IS

746
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
EXTRAORDINARILY BASIC.

747
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
ARMED GUARDS VERY RARE AT

748
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
SCHOOLS.

749
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
ONE SECURITY CONSULTANT TELLING

750
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
US THAT THIS SCHOOL SHOOTING IS

751
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
UNPRECEDENTED AT AN ELEMENTARY

752
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
SCHOOL.

753
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
IT'S HISTORYMAKING FOR ALL OF

754
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
THE WRONG REASONS.

755
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
WE HAVE NEVER REPORTED ON A MASS

756
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
SHOOTING OF THIS SCOPE AT AN

757
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HERE IN

758
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
AMERICA.

759
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I KNOW FROM PICKING UP MY LITTLE

760
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
NIECE AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

761
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
YOU SIGN IN A CLIPBOARD WHEN YOU

762
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
GO INTO THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL

763
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
AND THEN YOU PICK UP THE CHILD

764
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
AND THAT'S OFTEN THE CASE AT

765
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

766
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
THAT'S AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FEAT

767
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
THAT THESE SCHOOLS COULD BE ANY

768
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
MORE SECURED.

769
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
WE KNOW THAT THESE EVENTS CAN

770
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
HAPPEN AND THAT'S WHY TEACHERS

771
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
AND ADMINISTRATORS ARE DRILLED

772
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
ON THIS.

773
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
TEACHERS CALMLY TOOK THOSE

774
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
CHILDREN FROM THE SCHOOL.

775
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
ONE FATHER SAID THAT HE WAS

776
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
PROUD OF THE WAY THE SCHOOL AND

777
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
HIS COMMUNITY WAS REACTING TO

778
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
THIS MORNING.

779
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
OUR SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT

780
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000

782
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
PIERRE?
>> AGAIN, THE FBI AND ATF AND

783
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
FEDERAL SOURCES ARE TRYING TO

784
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
GIVE ALL OF THE SUPPORT THEY CAN

785
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
TO THE LOCAL POLICE, AGAIN,

786
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
LEAST 27 PEOPLE KILLED IN THIS

789
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
HORRIFIC INCIDENT.

THE PRESIDENT WAS BRIEFED SOME

801
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
TIME AGO BY THE FBI DIRECTOR

802
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
ROBERT MUELLER.

803
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
HE'S TALKED TO THE GOVERNOR OF

804
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000

808
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING HERE.

809
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
1:29 IN THE AFTERNOON.

810
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
THE NUMBERS HAVE SIMPLY BEEN

811
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
BREATHTAKING.
AT LEAST 27 SHOT AND KILLED.

812
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
MANY OF THEM CHILDREN.

813
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
AUTHORITIES ON THE SCENE WERE

814
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
AWAITING THE FIRST PRESS

815
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
CONFERENCE TO GET A CLEARER

816
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
PICTURE.
THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE GUNMAN

817
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
INVOLVED.

818
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
IT'S BELIEVED THAT THIS GUNMAN

819
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
THEN TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.

820
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
A MOTHER JOINED US EARLIERS TOLD

821
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
BROUGHT OUT, MANY OF THEM

823
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
INJURED, BLOODY.

824
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
A MASKED MAN ENTERED THE SCHOOL.

825
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
PARENTS THAT FOUND THEIR

826
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
CHILDREN AT THE NEARBY FIRE

827
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
HOUSE, HOLDING THEM, HUGGING

828
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
THEIR CHILDREN.
YOU CAN SIMPLY IMAGINE TRYING TO

829
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
FIND OUT IF THEIR CHILDREN IN

830
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
FACT ON THE OUTSIDE OR IF THEY

831
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
WERE PERHAPS IN ONE OF THE ROOMS

832
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
WHERE THIS DRAMATIC AND VERY SAD

833
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
TRAGEDY UNFOLDED HERE THIS

834
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
MORNING.
NO WORD ON WHO THIS GUNMAN IS,

835
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
WHAT THE MOTIVE COULD HAVE BEEN

836
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

837
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
NEVER ANY EXPLANATION FOR

838
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

839
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
BUT WE DO USUALLY GET A WINDOW

840
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
INTO THE PERSON WHO COULD COMMIT

841
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
SUCH A HEINOUS ACT.

842
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
WHAT WILL FOLLOW NOT ONLY THE

843
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL PLAY OUT

ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS PAEMPBTS

846
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
GET A FLASH OF THIS.

847
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
CHILDREN IN THE HOUSE, THIS IS

848
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
OUR SPECIAL REPORT COVERAGE OF A

849
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
SHOOTING IN CONNECTICUT.

850
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS YOU MIGHT

851
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
WANT TO ASK THEM TO LEAVE THE

852
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
ROOM OR GIVE THEM SOMETHING ELSE

853
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
TO DO AS WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW

854
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
THESE UNFOLDING DEVELOPMENTS.

855
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
DAN HARRIS ARRIVED AT THE FIRE

856
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
HOUSE A SHORM TIME AGO.

857
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
THAT WAS THE SPOT WHERE PARENTS

858
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
WERE ALERTED, TOLD TO GO.

859
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE DRIVE TO

860
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
GET TO THAT FIRE HOUSE TO FIND

861
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
OUT IF ONE OF THEIR CHILDREN WAS

862
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
AT THE FIRE HOUSE, WAITING FOR A

863
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
HUG, WAITING TO BE TAKEN HOME.

864
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
>> OH, YEAH, JUST FRANTIC.

865
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
DAVID, WATCHING THIS STEADY

866
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
STREAM OF FAMILIES FILING OUT OF

867
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
THIS FIRE HOUSE, WITH THE LOOKS

868
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
ON THEIR FACES, ON THEIR FACES,

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
PEOPLE ARE TEARFUL, THEIR FACES

871
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
ARE DRAWN AND PALE, SPEAKING TO

872
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
A PARENT EARLIER, SHE SAID I

873
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
NEED TO SORT OF PINCH MYSELF TO

874
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
WAKE UP AND REALIZE THAT THIS IS

875
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
HAPPENING HERE, IT DOESN'T FEEL

876
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
REAL, IT FEELS LIKE A DREAM AND

877
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
A VERY BAD ONE, A NIGHTMARE IN

878
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
FACT, THE TERM SHE USED.

879
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
PEOPLE ARE ABSOLUTELY IN SHOCK

880
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000

881
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
HORROR HERE.

882
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
DAVID, I'M SO STRUCK BY WATCHING

883
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
THESE FAMILIES WALKING OUT OF

884
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
THIS FIRE HOUSE.

885
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
LOT OF HUGGING GOING ON EVEN

886
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
AMONG FIRST RESPONDERS.

887
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
YOU'RE SEEING PEOPLE HERE TRULY

888
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
SHOCKED, EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE

889
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
USED TO SEEING VERY DIFFICULT

890
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
SCENES.
>> DAN HARRIS REPORTING FROM THE

891
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
VOLUNTEER FIRE HOUSE, RIGHT

892
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
AROUND THE CORNER FROM THE SANDY

893
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

894
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
ABOUT 500 STUDENTS GO TO SCHOOL

895
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
THERE.

896
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE TASK UNDER

897
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
WAY AFTER THE FIRST REPORT OF

898
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
THIS.
THE TEACHERS IN THAT SCHOOL,

899
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
CHILDREN WERE IN CLASS ROOMS,

900
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
SITTING AT THEIR DESKS WHEN THEY

901
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
GOT THE WORD FROM THEIR TEACHER,

902
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
GRAB A PAL, A BUDDY FOR THE

903
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
CLASS ROOM AND LEAVE.

904
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
WE SAW SOME OF IMAGES OF THEM

905
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
LEAVING.
AS DAN HARRIS REPORTED EARLIER,

906
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
THE TEARS, YOU COULD HEAR THE

907
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
CRYING OF THE STUDENTS LEAVING

908
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
THE SCHOOL.

909
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
NO SCREAMING.

910
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
HOW CAREFULLY THESE TEACHERS

911
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
CARRIED THIS OUT THIS AFTERNOON

912
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
AND REALLY, WHAT A FINE JOB THEY

913
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
DID UNDER SUCH EXTRAORDINARY

914
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
CIRCUMSTANCES.

915
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE'RE

916
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
GETTING BREAKING DEVELOPMENTS ON

917
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
THE INVESTIGATIVE SIDE OF IT,

CHRIS CUOMO.

919
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
ONE OF THE SHOOTERS WAS 24 YEARS

920
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000

921
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
THIS IS A NEW DEVELOPMENT.

922
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
WE KNEW AT LEAST ONE SHOOTER.

923
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
ONE SHOOTER TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.

924
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
IT'S BELIEVED RIGHT NOW THAT

925
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
STATE POLICE ARE CONFIRMING TO

926
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000

928
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
IN THIS MAZ SHOOTING.

929
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
ONE OF THOSE SHOOTERS TAKING

00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
THEIR OWN LIFE AFTER THIS

931
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
HORRIFIC SCENE.

932
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
IT WOULD ALSO HELP TO EXPLAIN AS

933
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
AARON REPORTED EARLIER WHY

934
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000

CONTINUING TO GO CAR TO CAR

937
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
SURROUNDING THAT SCHOOL.
YOU CAN SEE THE AERIAL SHOTS

938
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
SHOWING THE CHAOS.
THE PARKING LOTS SURROUNDING

939
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
THOSE SCHOOLS.
THEY WENT CAR TO CAR LOOKING FOR

940
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
EVERYDAY.

941
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
IT'S BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE

942
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
ALSO BELIEVED LOOKING FOR A

943
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
SECOND POSSIBLE GUNMAN.

950
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000

ABC NEWS.

952
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
PIERRE, WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
REPORTED ON SCENES LIKE THIS

954
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
KILLED IN COLUMBINE.

960
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
IT WAS HORRIFIC THEN AND IT'S

961
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000

962
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000

00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
MANY OF THOSE VICTIMS ARE

965
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
CHILDREN.
>> DAVID, AGAIN, YOU TALKED TO

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
FEDERAL SOURCES THEY HAVE BEEN

967
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
INVOLVED IN ALL KINDS OF CASES.

968
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
AND THIS IS AS DEPRESSED THEY

969
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
HAVE SOUND SINCE 9/11 TO BE

970
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
HONEST.

971
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
THEY'RE COMMITTED TO TRYING TO

972
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
GIVE WHATEVER SUPPORT THEY CAN

973
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
TO STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS.

974
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
AGAIN, JUST DEVASTATING.

975
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
>> DEVASTATING TO LEARN THE

976
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
DEVELOPMENTS HERE, TOO, THAT

977
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
THERE WERE POSSIBLY TWO GUNMEN

978
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
THAT ONE TAKING THEIR OWN LIFE

979
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
AFTERWARDS AND IT'S BELIEVED

980
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
THAT A 24-YEAR-OLD GUNMAN, AS

981
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
THIS SUSPECT IS DESCRIBED WAS

982
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
ARMED WITH FOUR WEAPONS, WAS

983
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
WEARING A BULLET PROOF VEST, WE

984
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
KNOW THAT'S THE DESCRIPTION

985
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
COMING FROM SOURCES.

986
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
ONE OF THE SHOOTERS, 24 YEARS

987
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
OLD.

988
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
CARI

989
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
CARRYING FOUR WEAPONS.

990
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
AND BEGAN FIRING.

991
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
PARENTS GOT WORD QUICKLY.

992
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
AS DAN WAS SAYING, THIS IS A

993
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
VERY SMALL TOWN A VERY

994
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY.
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW QUICKLY WORD

995
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
SPREAD AS THESE PARENTS

996
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
DESCRIBED GOING TO THE SCENE,

997
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
HOPING THAT THEY WOULD FIND

998
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
THEIR LOVED ONES.

999
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
NOW, AS THIS AFTERNOON UNFOLDS,

1000
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
THE QUESTION WILL BE, HOW MUCH

1001
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
HIGHER CAN THIS NUMBER GO?

1002
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
AND HOW THEY WILL BEGIN TO

1003
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
NOTIFY THE PARENTS OF THE

1004
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
CHILDREN WHO DID NOT MAKE IT

1005
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
OUT?
IT'S BELIEVED TO BE THE WORST

1006
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
SHOOTING AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

1007
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
IN AMERICA, IN HISTORY, THAT'S

1008
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
OUR BELIEF AT THIS POINT, WE

1009
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
CONTINUE TO LOOK BACK AND ACROSS

1010
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
OUR REPORTING OF INCIDENTS LIKE

1011
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
THIS ONE, THEY ARE ALL HORRIFIC

1012
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
AND OFTEN WHAT EMERGES ARE

1013
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
SCENES OF GREAT HEROISM AND IN

1014
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
THIS CASE JUST THE IMAGES OF THE

1015
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
TEACHERS, THEY'LL BE APPLAUDED

1016
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
FOR THEIR EFFORTS.

1017
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
WABC SPEAKING TO A YOUNG BOY

1018
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
ABOUT WHAT HE SAW AND IT'S

1019
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
BELIEVED THAT WE HAVE SOME OF

1020
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
THAT AUDIO NOW.

1021
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN.

1022
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
>> THERE'S A MAN PINNED DOWN TO

1023
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
THE GROUND WITH HANDCUFFS ON AND

1024
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
WE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE VICTIM.

1025
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
WE REALLY DIDN'T GET A GOOD

1026
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
GLANCE AT HIM BECAUSE, THERE WAS

1027
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
LIKE A CAR BLOCKING IT.

1028
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
PLUS, WE WERE RUNNING REALLY

1029
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
QUICK.

1030
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
SO, THEN, WE GOT TO THE FIRE

1031
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
HOUSE AND WE SAT IN OUR CLASSES

1032
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
AND WE JUST REALLY HAPPY THAT WE

1033
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
WERE ALL ALIVE.

1034
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
>> HAPPY THAT WE'RE ALL ALIVE,

1035
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
POWERFUL WORDS FROM A LITTLE BOY

1036
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
WITH A TRADEMARK BUZZ CUT

1037
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
GETTING OUT OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

1038
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
OKAY.

1039
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
HE TALKED ABOUT THAT FIRE HOUSE,

1040
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
THE SANDY HOOK VOLUNTEER FIRE

1041
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
HOUSE.

1042
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
STUDENTS WERE TOLD TO GRAB A

1043
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
FRIEND AND GET TO THE FIRE

1044
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
HOUSE.
THEY WALKED OUT OF SCHOOL ON A

1045
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
SUNNY DAY, LOW 40s.

1046
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A COAT ON.

1047
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
THEY WERE HUDDLED WITH THEIR

1048
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
PARENTS.
AFTER THEIR PARENTS ARRIVED.

1049
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
THERE WAS ONE MOTHER WITH A CELL

1050
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
PHONE, YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE

1051
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
PROBABLY CALLING DAD THAT THEIR

1052
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
CHILD IS OKAY.

1053
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
THAT LIMIT BOY SAYING THAT HE

1054
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
GOT A QUICK VIEW OF SOMEONE BUT

1055
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
THEY DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME

1056
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
SOMEONE WAS CAUSING SUCH HOUR

1057
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
>> Reporter:.

1058
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
IT'S BELIEVED AT THIS HOUR AND

1059
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
CONFIRMED THAT TWO SHOOTERS WERE

1060
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
INITIALLY INVOLVED IN THE MASS

1061
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
SHOOTING.

1062
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
ONE OF THOSE SHOOTERS NOW DEAD.

1063
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
WHETHER SOMETHING ENSUED AS

1064
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
AUTHORITIES BEGAN ARRIVING AT

1065
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
THE SCENE.

1066
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
NOW THE BIG QUESTION WILL BE, IS

1067
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
THERE IN FACT THAT SECOND

1068
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
SHOOTER AND WHERE IS THAT SECOND

1069
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
SHOOTER?

1070
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
SEARCHES HAVE UNFOLDED

1071
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON.

1072
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
CAR TO CAR.

1073
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
WITH AUTHORITIES THERE ARMED AS

1074
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
YOU CAN SEE.
THEY'RE HEAVILY ARMED.

1075
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
MANY OF THEM CARRYING THEIR

1076
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

1077
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
TO TRY TO FIND OUT REALLY WHAT

1078
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
UNFOLDED HERE TODAY.

1079
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING A PARENT

1080
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
OF A LITTLE CHILD WHO SAW THIS

1081
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
SCENE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT

1082
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
RIGHT NOW?

1083
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
JUST TEAMS OF AUTHORITIES COMING

1084
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
IN AND HOLDING GUNS?

1085
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU

1086
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
TYPICALLY SEE IN A TELEVISION

1087
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
DRAMA AND NOW, THESE CHILDREN

1088
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
WILL BE ASKING THEIR PARENTS

1089
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
ABOUT THE REALITY OF WHAT

1090
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
UNFOLDED THERE AT THEIR

1091
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TODAY.

1092
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
PIERRE, REPORTS COMING IN ABOUT

1093
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
A POSSIBLE SECOND SHOOTER, THAT

1094
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
WOULD EXPLAIN WHY WE SAW

1095
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
AUTHORITIES CONTINUING THEIR

1096
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
SEARCH UP UNTIL MOMENTS AGO?

1097
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1098
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS, YOU

1099
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
HAVE CONFLICTING INFORMATION

1100
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
FROM EYEWITNESSES.

1101
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
UNTIL YOU KNOW FOR SERB CERTAIN,
YOU'RE GOING TO CHECK EVERYTHING

1102
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
AROUND THAT SCHOOL UNTIL YOU

1103

1335
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000

00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE ABOUT

1337
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
THE PROCESS OF PICKING UP KIDS

00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
UP FROM SCHOOL, HOW IT'S A DAILY

1339
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
JOY FOR PARENTS, SPEAKING TO A

1340
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
PARENT WHO I WAS TALKING TO A

1341
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
SHORT WHILE AGO, HAVING HER TELL

1342
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
ME ABOUT THE COURSE OF HER DAY

1343
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
WHICH STARTED WITH THIS REVERSE

1344
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
911 TEXT MESSAGE THAT SHOWED UP

1345
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
ON HER PHONE THERE HAD BEEN A

1346
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
SHOOTING AT THE SCHOOL DIDN'T

1347
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
SAY WHICH ONE, PARENTS NEEDED TO

1348
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
GO PICK UP THEIR CHILDREN AS

1349
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000

1350
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
HER HUSBAND SAID GET IN THE CAR

1351
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000

1352
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
IMMEDIATELY.

1353
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
SHE GOT HER AND SAW HER HUSBAND

1354
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
HOLDING HER 8-YEAR-OLD.

1355
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
IT WAS SO INTERESTING TO WATCH

1356
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
THE BODY LANGUAGE BETWEEN THIS

1357
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
MOTHER AND THE 8-YEAR-OLD.

1358
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
THE MOTHER COULDN'T TAKE HER

1359
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
HANDS OFF HER CHILD.

1360
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
SHE WAS SO RELIEVED THAT HER

1361
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
CHILD WAS OKAY.

1362
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
NOW, SHE COULD NO LONGER TAKE

1363
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
FOR GRANTED.

1364
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
ONE OTHER QUICK EXCHANGE WITH A

1365
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
PARENT, I SAW A TRULY FRANTIC,

VERY ANXIOUS WOMAN SHOWING UP ON

1367
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
THE SCENE HERE A WHILE AGO, SHE

1368
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN IN THE

1369
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS

1370
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000

00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000

00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
SHE ALSO SAID THAT SHE HAD

1374
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000

00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
NEARBY, SHE WAS WAITING FOR A

1376
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
FEW HOURS TO PICK THEM UP.

1377
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
THESE ARE THE LAST TWO HOURS OF

1378
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
THEIR CHILDHOOD, ONCE THEY HEAR

1379
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000

00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
YOU GET A SENSE OF THE LOSS.

1382
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
WHEN YOU WATCH PEOPLE FILING OUT

00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
TYPICALLY, IF IT WEREN'T A SCALE

1466
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
THIS LARGE, THE PRESIDENT

1467
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
WOULDN'T BE BRIEFED.

1468
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
BUT THE FACT SO MANY DEAD AND SO

1469
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
MANY CHILDREN, THE PRESIDENT HAD

1470
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
TO BE BRIEFED.

1471
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
IT REMIND ME OF THE VIRGINIA

1472
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
TECH SHOOTING, WHERE YOU HAVE A

1473
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
CLASS ROOM SITUATION, OFTEN

1474
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
NOWHERE TO GO, IF THE GUNMAN

1475
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
COMES THROUGH A SINGLE DOOR YOU

1476
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
COULD HAVE THESE MASS

1477
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
CASUALTIES.

1478
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
IN VIRGINIA TECH, MANY PEOPLE

1479
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
WERE SHOT AND THE SHOOTER ONLY

1480
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
HAD A HANDGUN

1481
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
>> I REMEMBER THAT VIVIDLY.

1482
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
PIERRE, THAT WAS ONE OF THE

1483
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
GREAT TRAGEDIES OF THAT

1484
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
PARTICULAR SHOOTING AND SO MANY

1485
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
WE REPORT ON, THAT ONE SINGLE

1486
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
ENTRANCE THAT YOU DESCRIBE IT

1487
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
BASICALLY SUMS UP WHAT THESE

1488
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
CLASS ROOMS ARE LIKE FOR

1489
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
STUDENTS AND TEACHERS.

1490
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
BECAUSE THERE'S ONE DOORWAY

1491
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
THERE'S REALLY LITTLE ROOM FOR

1492
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
THESE CHILDREN AND THE TEACHERS

1493
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
ARE IN THOSE CLASS ROOMS WITH

1494
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
THEM TO ESCAPE WHEN HORROR LIKE

1495
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
THIS UNFOLDS.

1496
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
THE LIMIT BOY TALKED ABOUT HOW

1497
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
HE GOT OUT.

1498
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
SAW SOMEONE THEY DIDN'T KNOW AT

1499
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
THE TIME WAS THE PARTICULAR

1500
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
GUNMAN INSIDE THE SCHOOL INFL  T

1501
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
INFLICTING SUCH HORROR.

1502
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
HE TALKED ABOUT HOW HAPPY HE WAS

1503
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
TO SEE HIS FRIENDS AND THAT HIS

1504
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
FRIENDS HAD MADE IT OUT.

1505
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
PROFOUND WORDS BY A CHILD.

1506
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
NOW, WORDS FROM HIS FATHER.

1507
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
>> IT WAS TERRIFYING.

1508
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I'M STILL IN SHOCK.

1509
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I KNOW THAT THERE WERE SOME

1510
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
PEOPLE MISSING.

1511
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
THEY WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL.

1512
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYONE HAS

1513
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR.

1514
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RUSHING OVER

1515
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
HERE AND YOU CAN'T GET TO WHERE

1516
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
YOU NEED TO GO.

1517
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
YOU HAVE TO PARK DOWN HERE AND

1518
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
WALK.
I'M GLAD THAT MY SON IS OKAY.

1519
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
HE SEEMS TO BE HANDLING ACTUALLY

1520
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW.

1521
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I KNOW MY SON'S TEACHERS HAVE

1522
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
BEEN OKAY AS WELL.

1523
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
BUTTING, I HAVE HEARD OTHER

1524
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,000
TEACHERS AREN'T OKAY THERE WERE

1525
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
A FEW, THEY FOUND, I JUST FOUND

1526
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
ONE, A BIG CHEER WENT UP, THEY

1527
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
FOUND SOMEONE.

1528
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
THEY MAY NOT BEEN AT THE FIRE

1529
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
HOUSE BUT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

1530
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
>> THE NUMBERS, COULD BE 27

1531
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
PEOPLE.

1532
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
>> PAINFUL TO WATCH.

1533
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
THE DAD WHO PUT SIMPLY HIS HAND

1534
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
TO HIS MOUTH AND YOU CAN ONLY

1535
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
IMAGINE WHEN THE PARENTS ARE

1536
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
ABLE TO GET THEIR HEADS AROUND

1537
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
WHAT UNFOLDED HERE TODAY AND THE

1538
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
FACT THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN

1539
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
EXTRAORDINARY LUCKY TO FIND

1540
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
THEIR LITTLE ONES WAITING THERE

1541
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
WHEN THEY GOT THERE.

1542
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
AN EXCRUCIATING DIFFICULT

1543
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
PROCESS OF INFORMING PARENTS

1544
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000

1545
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
MAKE IT OUT.

1546

00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
THESE COMMUNITIES ARE ALL BESIDE

THESE FAMILIES KNOW EACH

1568

INTIMATELY.

1569
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
THE DANBURY HOSPITAL WAS ON

00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
STAND BY.

PERHAPS YOU CAN DESCRIBE THE

1572
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
SCENE FOR US AT THIS HOUR.

1573
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
>> DAVID, AS WE ARRIVED HERE AT

1574
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
DANBURY, WE PULLED UP TO THE

1575
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
EMERGENCY ROOM, THERE WERE

1576
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
POLICE OFFICERS WITH ASSAULT

1577
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
RIVALS, THE ENTIRE HOSPITAL

1578
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
COMPLEX IS ON LOCKDOWN, THEY SAY

1579
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
THAT'S STANDARD PROCEDURE,

1580
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
CERTAINLY GIVEN THE

1581
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S SADLY

1582
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
UNDERSTANDABLE.
THE MOOD INSIDE THE HOSPITAL IS

1583
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
REALLY ACTUALLY QUITE GRIME.

1584
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
WE HEARD SCENES DESCRIBED TO US

1585
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
AS NURSES BREAKING DOWN IN THE

1586
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
CORRIDORS.
PEOPLE SIMPLY AS YOU PUT IT

1587
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
CAN'T GET THEIR ARMS AROUND THE

1588
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
SCOPE, THE EVIL THAT HAS BEEN

1589
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
PERSON TATED ON THIS COMMUNITY.

1590
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
IT WILL PLAY IT OUT OVER THE

1591
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.

1592
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE I HAVE

1593
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
SPOKEN TO HERE ARE HEART BROKEN

1594
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO

1595
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
TREAT MORE PATIENTS.

1596
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
>> THREE PEOPLE REPORTEDLY

1597
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
TREATED AT DANBURY HOSPITAL

1598
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
WHICH HAD BEEN DESIGNATED A

1599
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
TRIAGE CENTER.

1600
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
WHICH WOULD ONLY LEAD US TO

1601
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE IN THE PATH

1602
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
OF THIS GUNMAN INSIDE THE SCHOOL

1603
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
DID NOT SURVIVE.

1604
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
THAT THE NUMBER OF BEING TREATED

1605
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
WOULD ONLY BE THREE AT THIS

1606
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
HOUR.

1607
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
AS N.J. REPORTED THERE,

1608
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
DESCRIBING THE SCENES INSIDE THE

1609
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
CORRIDORS.
WE KNOW THAT EVERY INCH OF THAT

00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
SCHOOL, EVERY CRACK, EVERY

1611
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
CREVICE WAS CHECKED AS THEY

1612
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
CONTINUE TO SEARCH TO TRY TO

1613
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
SECURE THE AREA.

1614
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE

1615
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
MIGHT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN

1616
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
THIS.
A QUESTION THAT WILL BE

1617
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
OUTSTANDING UNTIL WE CAN GET

1618
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
FURTHER INFORMATION FROM

1619
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
AUTHORITIES.

1620
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
THEY DID CONFIRM FOR THAT

1621
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
COMMUNITY AS WE CONTINUE OUR

1622
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
LIVE COVERAGE THAT THE SCENE

1623
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
ITSELF HAS BEEN SECURED.

1624
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
THEY WERE ARMED WITH THEIR

1625
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
TACTICAL GEAR IN FRONT OF THE

1626
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
CHILDREN, GOING CAR TO CAR AS

1627
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000

00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
HAS BEEN ON THE SCENE FROM THE

1631
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
MOMENT THEY GOT WORD OF THIS.

1632
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
WE DO KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR,

1633
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
DAN MALLOY IS INSIDE BRIEFING

1634
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
PARENTS.

1635
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
THAT HAS TO BE THE PAINFUL

1636
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
MEETING SO FAR OF THE DAY, THE

1637
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
PARENTS WHO DO NOT WHETHER OR

1638
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
NOT THEIR CHILDREN MADE IT OUT.
