00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
FRYING.

202
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
SPIKE: YOU'RE NOT
PUTTING THE CHICKEN IN A

212
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
THESE ARE PANKO BREAD

221
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I LOVE EGGS -- A LOT OF

224
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
IF I CAN ACTUALLY

INSTEAD OF JUST WHOLE

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
EGGS, SEE?
DANNY: BECAUSE EGG

235
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
WHITES HAVE LESS

236
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000

SPIKE: EXACTLY, IT'S

237
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000

545
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000

CARROTS?
SHENEKA: LOW SODIUM

CHICKEN BROTH.

549
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
DEVIN JR.: WHY DO WE

550
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
NEED CHICKEN BROTH?
DEVIN: ARE WE GOING TO

551
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
FRY THE CHICKEN IN

552
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
CHICKEN BROTH?

553
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
OUT OF THESE TWO RECIPE

554
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
BOXES, IM NOT SEEING

555
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
ANYTHING THAT COMPARES

556
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
TO MY SOUTHERN FRIED

557
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
CHICKEN.

558
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
SHENEKA: ORGANIC
KETCHUP.

559
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
TYRAH: MAPLE SYRUP AND

560
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
GREEK YOGURT?

561
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
DEVIN JR.: IT SOUNDS
LIKE PANCAKE MIX.

562
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
TYRAH: THIS IS NOT AT

563
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
ALL SIMILAR TO MY

564
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
FATHER'S RECIPE, SO IT'S

565
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
STRANGE AND DIFFERENT.

566
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
SHENEKA: MAYONNAISE?

567
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
VICTORIA: I DO NOT LIKE
MAYONNAISE.

568
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
SHENEKA: YEAH, WE KNOW

569
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
YOU DON'T.

570
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
APPLE CIDER VINEGAR?

571
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
LET'S START COOKING,
GUYS.

572
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
WHY DON'T THREE OF US

573
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
TAKE THE GREEN, AND

574
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
THREE OF YOU TAKE THE
YELLOW.

575
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
TYRAH: ALL RIGHT.
TYSHUN: ALL RIGHT, LET'S

576
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000

DEVIN JR.: LET'S GO.

577
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
SHENEKA: ALL RIGHT,

578
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
GUYS, LET'S GET COOKING,
LET'S GET COOKING.

579
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
WHERE'S OUR CUTTING

580
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
BOARD?

581
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
A HALF CUP OF WHOLE

582
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
WHEAT FLOUR.

583
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
VICTORIA: I'M ON IT.
DEVIN: I DON'T KNOW HOW

584
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
YOBAKE

585
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
CHICKEN, BUT WE'RE GOING

586
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
TO FIND OUT.

587
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
VICTORIA: THE GREEN
RECIPE IS GOING TO BE

588
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
REALLY HEALTHY, BUT I'M

589
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
NOT SURE IF IT'S GOING

590
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
TO TASTE GOOD, BECAUSE

591
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
THE INGREDIENTS THAT

592
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
THEY'RE PUTTING IN DON'T

593
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
REALLY LOOK THAT GREAT.

594
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
OOH, IT'S YELLOW.

595
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
SHENEKA: THAT'S
CORNMEAL.

596
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
VICTORIA: THAT LOOKS
UNUSUAL.

597
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
THAT LOOKS KIND OF

598
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
WEIRD, BUT OKAY.

599
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
DEVIN JR.: THIS IS

600
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
DEFINITELY DIFFERENT

601
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
THAN MY DAD'S RECIPE.
THE STEPS ARE THE SAME,

602
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
BUT DIFFERENT
INGREDIENTS.

603
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
DEVIN: I THINK THAT THE
GREEK YOGURT IS GOING TO

604
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
GIVE IT A NICE, SMOOTH,

605
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
REFRESHING TASTE, DON'T
YOU?

606
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
DEVIN JR.: I'M NOT USED

607
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
TO HAVING YOGURT IN MY
CHICKEN.

608
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
DEVIN: YEAH, BUT WE HAVE

609
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
TO OPEN OUR MINDS, SON.

610
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
YOUR DAD'S TRADITIONAL

611
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
FRIED CHICKEN.

612
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
DEVIN JR.: THIS IS GOING

613
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
TO BE SPICY WITH ALL
THAT JALAPENO.

614
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
DEVIN: YOU'RE SURE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT, SON.

615
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
VICTORIA: TWO

616
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
TABLESPOONS?
DAD USES THE WHOLE

617
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
BOTTLE.

618
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
DEVIN: DUMP IT IN THERE,

619
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
SON.

620
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
THAT'S OUR MARINADE, AND

621
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
THE YOGURT IS GOING TO

622
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
GIVE IT A NICE,

623
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
SUCCULENT, MOIST,

624
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
TENDERIZED FLAVOR.

625
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
MASSAGE IT IN THERE,

626
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
TYRAH.

627
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
DELICIOUS.

628
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
TYRAH: IT SMELLS PRETTY

629
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
GOOD.

630
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
VICTORIA: THE GREEN

631
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
RECIPE HAS A LOT OF
VEGETABLES, AND IT NEEDS

632
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
TO BE THICK CUT.

633
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
IT'S A LOT OF WORK.

634
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
BETTEREATS.COM SAYS THAT

635
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
RED CABBAGE HAS MORE

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
CRISPY ALREADY.

662
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
IT FEELS CRISPY AND

663
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
CRUNCHY.

664
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000

SHENEKA: OKAY, GUYS,
THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN

00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
ARE YOU READY TO TASTE?

678
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
SHENEKA: THE GREEN GOES

683
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
WITH THE COLE SLAW.

684
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
VICTORIA: MMM.

685
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I LIKE HOW IT'S CRISPY

686
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
SHENEKA: IT'S DELICIOUS.

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
DEVIN JR.: IT'S
HEALTHIER, AND IT TASTES

689
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
AMAZING.
TYSHUN: I WOULD TRY IT

690
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
AGAIN.
I WOULD TRY IT LIKE

691
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
PROBABLY EVERY WEEK.

692
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
TYRAH: I CAN SEE THIS

693
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
BEING ONE OF OUR REGULAR

694
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
MEALS.
VICTORIA: I LOVE THE

695
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
COLE SLAW, EVEN THOUGH

696
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
IT HAS MAYONNAISE IN IT,

697
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
AND IT HAS LIKE A PINCH

698
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
OF SPICINESS.

699
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
SHENEKA: IT HAS A NICE

700
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
KICK.
VICTORIA: YEAH.

701
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
DEVIN: THE GREEN RECIPE

702
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
WAS REALLY GOOD, BUT

703
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
WAIT UNTIL WE TRY THE

704
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
YELLOW CHICKEN RECIPE.

705
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000

TYRAH: TASTY.

707
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
SHENEKA: I THINK IT'S A
GREAT SUBSTITUTE FOR

708
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
FRIED CHICKEN -- THE

709
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
SAUCE, THE BARBECUE

710
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
SAUCE.

711
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
DEVIN: THE YELLOW RECIPE
IS AWESOME, AND THE

712
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
BARBECUE SAUCE JUST
TOPPED IT JUST

713
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
PERFECTLY.

714
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
DEVIN JR.: NOW, I SEE
WHY WE USED THAT MAPLE

715
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
SYRUP.

716
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
VICTORIA: I STILL DON'T

717
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
TASTE ANY YOGURT.

718
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
DEVIN: BUT, ACTUALLY,

719
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
YOU DO.

720
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
DO YOU TASTE THE

721
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
TENDERNESS OF THE
CHICKEN?

722
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
VICTORIA: MM-HM.

723
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
DEVIN: THAT'S BECAUSE WE

724
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
MARINATED IT IN GREEK
YOGURT.

725
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
SHENEKA: MM, WE DON'T

726
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
NEED FRIED CHICKEN AGAIN

727
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
-- DEEP FRIED CHICKEN.

728
