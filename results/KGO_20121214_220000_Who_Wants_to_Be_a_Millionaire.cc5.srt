IT'S SO EXCITING.

HERE YOU GO, SHERRY-ANN.

283
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
NOT REFERENCING EATING HABITS,

284
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
PSYCHOLOGY TODAY CALLS WHO

285
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
"THE SANDWICH GENERATION"

286
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
BECAUSE OF PRESSURES FACED

287
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
BY THEIR ADULT CHILDREN

288
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
AND AILING PARENTS?

289
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
>> YOU KNOW, THE MILLENNIALS,

290
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO SAY

291
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
THAT'S MY GENERATION, MAYBE.

292
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M TELLING

293
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
MY AGE, BUT I WANT TO SAY

294
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
THAT'S MY GENERATION.

295
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
GOOD WARRIORS--

296
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH.

297
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
HARD TIMERS...

298
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
MAYBE BABY BOOMERS--

299
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
JUST SOUNDS LIKE, YOU KNOW--

300
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
MY MOM'S A BABY BOOMER,

301
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
AND, YOU KNOW,

302
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
YOU KNOW?

303
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
AND SHE HAS ADULT CHILDREN,

304
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
OBVIOUSLY.

305
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH

306
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I DON'T WANT TO ADMIT IT.

307
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
BUT, YOU KNOW...

308
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
IT JUST MAKES SENSE.

309
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'M GONNA GO WITH--SAY, "B,"

310
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
BABY BOOMERS, FINAL ANSWER.

311
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
>> I'M A BABY BOOMER.

312
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
YOU GOT IT RIGHT.

313
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
IT WAS BABY BOOMERS.

314
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
ALL

315
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
LET'S PUT MORE MONEY

316
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
IN THAT BANK.

317
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
YOU WANT IT.

318
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
YOU'RE GETTING IT.
$1,000.

319
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
$14,500.

320
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
5 QUESTIONS LEFT IN ROUND 1.

321
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
THE BIG, BIG MONEY

322
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
IS STILL UP THERE.

323
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
ALL THE MONEY LOOKS GOOD,

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
THOUGH.
"CAREER CHANGE."

325
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
EARNING AN IMPRESSIVE

72 DELEGATE VOTES,

327
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
WHAT SITCOM ICON CAME IN SECOND

328
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
IN THE RACE FOR

329
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
THE 2012 GREEN PARTY

330
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION?

331
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
>> HMM.

332
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
CANDICE BERGEN...

333
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'M NOT EVEN SURE

334
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
WHAT SHE'S BEEN DOING LATELY.

335
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
UM...

336
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
ROSEANNE BARR...

337
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE, YOU KNOW,

338
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
THAT SHE WOULD BE

339
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

340
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I HOPE NOT.

341
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
[laughter]

342
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
UM, YOU KNOW,

343
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'M KIND OF TORN BETWEEN

344
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
MICHAEL J. FOX--

345
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
HE JUST SEEMS LIKE HE'S,

346
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
YOU KNOW, IN THE MIX OF THINGS,

347
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
YOU KNOW, WITH THINGS GOING ON

348
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
IN CONGRESS AND SENATE,

349
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
YOU KNOW.

350
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
SMART GUY, YOU KNOW.

351
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
BILL COSBY...

352
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
YOU KNOW, BILL IS ALWAYS

353
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
IN THE NEWS, BUT...

354
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I DON'T THINK FOR ANYTHING

355
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
DEALING WITH THE

356
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION,

357
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
THAT I'VE HEARD OF, YOU KNOW?

358
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I LIKE MY NEWS.

359
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I TRY TO KEEP UPDATED.

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
SITCOM ICON.

362
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
YOU KNOW WHAT, MEREDITH?

363
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE

364
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
TO JUMP THE QUESTION.
I'M JUST NOT 100% CONFIDENT.

365
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
>> THAT'S A SMART MOVE.

366
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
QUESTION'S OUT OF PLAY.

367
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
LET'S SEE THE ANSWER.
WAS IT MICHAEL J. FOX?

368
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
IT WAS...

369
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
IT WAS THE WOMAN

370
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
YOU DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE

371
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
GETTING THAT...

372
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
>> SHAME ON ME.
>> NOMINATION, ROSEANNE BARR.

373
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
OKAY, LET'S SEE

374
