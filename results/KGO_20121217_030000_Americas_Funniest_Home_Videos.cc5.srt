880
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
PARTRIDGES IN PEAR TREES.

881
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
CATS. WELL, ALL RIGHT.
MAYBE NOT CATS YET,

882
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
BUT AFTER THIS, OH, YOU WILL.

883
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
HEY, I THOUGHT ONLY REINDEER

884
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
(child laughs)

886
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
OOH.

887
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
(man) PUT HIM ON THE GROUND.
NO, WE'RE NOT MAKING HIM
DO THIS.

888
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
JUST SEE IF HE CAN WALK.

889
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
HE CAN'T WALK, ROB.

890
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
KIDS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES
WHO HATE CLOTHES FOR CHRISTMAS.

891
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
NO, ROB, THIS IS CRUEL.
COME ON.

892
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
HONEY, PUT HIM ON HIS FEET.
LET HIM CRAWL.

893
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
HE...

894
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
(laughs)

895
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
ROB, NO.
COME HERE.

896
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
FRED... (laughs)

897
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
(laughter)

898
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
ROB, THIS IS MEAN.

899
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
COME ON. (laughs)

900
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000

902
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
(indistinct conversations)

903
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
(laughter)

904
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
APPARENTLY, CURIOSITY
WRAPPED THE CAT.

905
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
LOOK. LOOK.

906
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
(laughter continues)

907
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
(woman) OPEN IT.
(laughs)

908
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
YOU KNOW
THE TEN LORDS-A-LEAPIN'?

909
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
THIS MUST BE THEIR CAT.

910
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
OH!

911
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
(man's voice)
♪ OH, CHRISTMAS TREE

912
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000

915
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
(laughter)

916
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
(woman) ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.
OPEN IT. HURRY UP.

917
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
WHY? IS IT GONNA SUFFOCATE
OR SOMETHING?

918
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
RIP IT FROM THE TOP.

919
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
AAH! OH, MY. OH, MY!

920
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
OH! OH!

921
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
(laughs)

922
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
OH, MY GOD. AM I REALLY SEEING
SOMETHING WITH MY EYES?

923
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY!
COME TO MA--

924
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
OH, MY! OH! OH!
IS THIS A DREAM OR SOMETHING?

925
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
(laughing)

926
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
OH, MY! OH, MY GOD!

927
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
OH, MY GOD! OH!

928
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I PULLED A MUSCLE.

929
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
AND NOW...

930
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
WHAT ARE THEY?

931
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
(whirring)

932
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
(man) ALL DONE.
NOW GO GET PRESENTS.

933
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
WHAT ARE THEY?

934
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
(speaks indistinctly)

935
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
(crash)

936
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
WELL, SO MUCH
FOR THAT PRESENT.

937
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
(crying)

938
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
THIS HAS BEEN...

939
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I BET SANTA AND MRS. CLAUS
HAVE A REALLY GOOD MARRIAGE.

940
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I'M SURE THEY DO,
BUT YOU CAN HARDLY BLAME HER

941
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
IF OCCASIONALLY SHE GOT
ON THE BIG GUY'S CASE.

942
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
"REALLY? YOU GOTTA WORK
ON CHRISTMAS... AGAIN?"

943
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
HE'S GOT THE REMOTE CONTROL,

944
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
BUT WHERE'S THE REST
OF HIS GIFT?

945
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
(man) I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'LL HAVE TO TURN IT ON.

946
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I DON'T REMEMBER.

947
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
(whirring)

948
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,000
(woman laughing)

949
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
(boy) OHH.

950
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
HEY, SANTA, NEXT TIME

00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
YOU ALL RIGHT, SANTA?
(grunting)

954
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
WHY SHOULD THE TREE BE
THE ONLY ONE

955
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
WITH THAT FRESH PINE SCENT?

956
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
(woman) OH, MY GOSH!
(laughs)

957
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
OH, MY GOSH!

958
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000

959
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
OH, MY GOSH.

960
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
OHH!
(laughter)

961
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000

(woman laughing)

964
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
(woman) NO, I DIDN'T BUY IT.

965
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
THERE'S ANOTHER TREBLE CLEF
UP THERE, BUT I...

966
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000

967
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000

(woman)
PUT HIM ON HIS BACK, HONEY,

972
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT HIS FACE

973
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
HE'S GONNA... HE'S GONNA...

974
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
HERE'S A KID WHO NEEDS
SOME CLOTHES FOR CHRISTMAS.

975
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000

984
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
