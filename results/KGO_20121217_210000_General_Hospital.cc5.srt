GET OUT OF HERE.

486
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'M SURE FAISON'S PREPARED FOR
MY POTENTIAL ESCAPE.

>> Robert: WELL, YOU SHOULD

492
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
THANK ANNA.
SHE'S THE ONE THAT FIGURED THAT

493
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
THERE MIGHT BE ONE MORE PIECE

494
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
LEFT IN FAISON'S PUZZLE AND YOU

495
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
COULD ACTUALLY BE ALIVE.

496
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

497
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
>> Duke: MIND WHAT?

498
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000

WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

503
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
YOU CAN DO ANY TEST THAT YOU

504
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
LIKE, BUT I THINK WE SHOULD DO

505
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
THEM ELSEWHERE.

506
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
>> Anna: FAISON IS IN CUSTODY.

507
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
HE CAN'T HURT US.

508
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
>> Duke: YES, BUT HE HAS PEOPLE.

509
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
HE HAS PEOPLE HERE.

510
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
HE HAS A WOMAN HERE THAT WOULD

511
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
DO ANYTHING FOR HIM.

512
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I THINK SHE RUNS THE PLACE.

513
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000

530
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I UNDERSTAND THE BOND BETWEEN

HIS OWNERS LOANED HIM OUT FOR A

951
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
VERY -- A VERY WORTHY CAUSE.
ROCCO AND I WENT UP TO THE

BECAUSE WHY?

1007

MUCH ABOUT IT BACK THEN, EVEN

1017
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000

THE TRUTH?

1259
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
THESE JEWELS, THIS OUTFIT, THIS

1260
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
LIFE DIDN'T ALWAYS FIT ME.

1261
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I BEGAN MY CAREER IN MUCH

1262

>> Bree: NEVADA.

1272
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
THE WOMAN WHO LOOKED AFTER THE

1273
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000

1274
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
>> Felix: THE MADAM.

1275
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
>> Bree: HER NAME WAS RENEE, AND

1276
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
SHE CARED ABOUT US.

1277
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
>> Sabrina: EVEN THOUGH SHE MADE

1278
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
YOU --

1279
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
>> Bree: NOBODY MADE US DO
ANYTHING.

1280
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
IT WAS OUR CHOICE TO BE THERE.

1281
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
IT WAS HER CHOICE TO MAKE SURE

1282
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
THAT WE STAYED HEALTHY.

1283
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
"SAFE SEX OR NO SEX," RENEE

1284
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
ALWAYS SAID.

1285
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
AND YEARS LATER, I INSISTED UPON

1286
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000

>> Bree: I DID.
NO GIRL OF MINE WAS GONNA GET

1289

1290
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
SO DON'T SAY I DON'T CARE.

1291
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
>> Sabrina: IS THIS YOUR WAY OF

1292
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
SAYING WE CAN SEE MISS COE?

1293
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000

1294
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000

1302
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
YOU WANT TO DO THAT REST?

1303

1305
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000

WE CAN DO THAT.

1307
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO FIND

1308

1314
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000

REALLY GOOD IDEA.

1319
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000

DIDN'T THINK OF ROBIN.

1324
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
SHE WAS ALWAYS A BRIGHT GIRL.

1325
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
SHE'D SEE STRAIGHT THROUGH

1326
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000

>> Duke: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1336
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
>> Anna: THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION

1337
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
AT THE HOSPITAL WHERE SHE
WORKED, AND --

1338
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
>> Duke: SO SHE DID BECOME A

1339

>> Anna: YEAH, YEAH. YEAH.

1341
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
SHE WAS A REALLY, REALLY GOOD
DOCTOR.

1342
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
SHE WAS GREAT.

1343
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
BUT, UM, WE WERE TOLD THAT HER

1344
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
BODY HAD BURNED, YOU KNOW, AND

1345
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
WE COULDN'T REALLY SEE IT.

1346
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
AND SO WE BURIED HER AND TRIED

1347
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
TO GET ON WITH YOUR LIVES, WHICH

1348
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
IS IMPOSSIBLE.

DO THAT?

1357
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
>> Anna: BECAUSE SHE WAS PLAYING
WITH MY MIND, YOU SEE?

1358
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
>> Duke: SO SHE WAS LYING TO

1359

00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
WELL, NOW I AM NOT SO SURE,
