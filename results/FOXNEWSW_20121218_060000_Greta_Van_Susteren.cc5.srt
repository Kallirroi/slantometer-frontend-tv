WEEKS AWAY.

773
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
REPORTS SAY THE PRESIDENT MADE A

774
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
NEW PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE TOP

BILLION MORE IN 10 YEARS.

778
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
A SPOKESMAN SAYS THE PRESIDENT'S

779
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
PROPOSAL DOESN'T INCLUDE ENOUGH

780
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
SPENDING CUTS.

781
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
SENATOR DANIEL INOHA DIED

782
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
MONDAY.
HE WAS A MEDAL OF HONOR WINNENER

783
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
WORLD WAR II AND THE FIRST

784
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
JAPANESE AMERICAN TO SERVE IN

785
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
CONGRESS WHEN ELECTED TO THE

786
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
HOUSE IN 1959.

787
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
HAWAII SENATOR DANIEL INOUYE WAS

788
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
88 YEARS OLD.

789
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
HIS LAST WORDS -- ALOHA.

790
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
NOW BACK TO GRETA.

791
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
THE POWER TO TALK.

792
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
NPRESIDENT OBAMA CLINTON WILL

793
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
BE.

794
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
AND TONIGHT SECRETARY CLINTON

795
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
IS RECOVERING FROM A FAINTING

796
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
SPELL AND A CONCLUSION.

797
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
GOOD EVENING.

798
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
ANY PROBLEM WITH THE SECRETARY

799
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
NOT TESTIFYING?

800
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
>> WELL, I THINK SHE WILL HAVE

801
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
TO TESTIFY AT SOME POINT.

802
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
YOU KNOW EVERY FOREIGN SERVICE

803
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
OFFICER IN EVERY FOREIGN

804
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
MINISTRY KNOWS THE PHRASE I AM

805
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
ABOUT TO USE.

806
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO A

807
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
MEETING OR CONFERENCE OR

808
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
EVINT.

809
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
YOU HAVE A DIPLOMATIC ILLNESS

810
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
AND THIS IS WOB - ON ONE TO

811
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
BEAT THE BAN.

812
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
IT WAS REVEALED IN A WAY THAT

813
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
WAS NOT TRANSPARENT AND I

814
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
THINK THERE IS AN OBLIGATION

815
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
HERE ESPECIALLY IF SECRETARY

816
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
CLINTON DECIDES TO RUN FOR

817
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
PRESIDENT.
SHE MAY BE TESTIFYING THIS

818
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
WEEK, BUT SHE WILL NOT ESCAPE

819
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
IT FOREVER.

820
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I DON'T THINK SHE INDICATED

821
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
THAT SHE WILL NOT TESTIFY EVER

822
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT SHE

823
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
HAD THE FLU AND A WOMAN WHO

824
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
LIVED IN AN AIRPLANE FOR FOUR

825
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
YEARS REPORTED THAT SHE WAS

826
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
DEHYDRATED AND IF YOU FALL AND

827
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
GET A CONCLUSION THAT IS IT A

828
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
BRAIN INJURY.

829
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
BUT SHE DID SAY THAT SHE IS

830
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
GOING TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE

831
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
ENTIRE COPY OF THE

832
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
INVESTIGATIONS DONE AND

833
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
COMPLETED AMBASSADOR PICKERING

834
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
AND ADMIRAL MULLEN AND SHE

835
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
DEPARTMENT HAVE TO TURN OVER

836
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
THE ENTIRE SUMMARY AND THAT IS

837
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
IT A POSITIVE STEP FORWARD.

838
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
IT IS IT TIME THAT THE

839
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE FIPED OUT.

840
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I DON'T LIKE THAT IT IS DONE

841
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
CLOSED DOORS ON WEDNESDAY .

842
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
THERE IS SOME ASPECTS THAT ARE

843
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
CLASSIFIED AND SOME ARE NOT.

844
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS

845
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
TWO HEARINGS.

846
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I TELL YOU THE SECRETARY

847
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
STAYED OUT THE PUBLIC LIME

848
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
LIGHT.
I THINK SHE WAS WAITING FOR

849
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
THE REPORT SO SHE COULD FIND

850
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
OUT WHAT IT SAID.

851
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
AND NOTHING MORE EMBARRASSING

852
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
THAN TO SAY SOMETHING AND THEN

853
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
HAVE IT CONTRADICTED AND HAVE

854
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
TO CHANGE THE STORY.

855
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
SHE HAD A CHANCE TO READ THE

856
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
REPORT AND WRITE HER TESTIMONY

857
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
AT HER LEISURE AND I THINK

858
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
THAT IS NOT TRANSPARENT,

859
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
EITHER.

860
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
>> TWO QUESTIONS.

861
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
DID SHE CHOOSE AMBASSADOR

862
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
PICKERING AND ADMIRAL MULEN

863
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
AND THAT IS THE FIRST

864
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
QUESTION.

865
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
ARE THEY GOOD AGGRESSIVE

866
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
INVESTIGATORS?
>> IF SHE PICKED TWO THAT WERE

867
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
LIGHT WEIGHTS, I WOULD BE SUS.

868
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
BUT SHE PICK TWO GOOD ONES.

869
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
>> UNDER SECRETARY FOR

870
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
MANAGEMENT PATRICK KENNEDY

871
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
PICKED THEM.

872
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I WOULD LIKE TO SO THE REPORT

873
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
BEFORE JUDGING THE

874
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
PERSONALITYINGS.

875
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
TWO EVENTS SECRETARY CLINTON

876
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
MANAGE TOD AVOID BEING IN

877
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
PUBLIC.

878
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
TWO CRITICAL POINTS SHE WAS

879
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
UNAVAILABLE.
FIRST, THE FAMOUS SUNDAY TALK

880
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
SHOWS IN FIVE DAYS AFTER THE

881
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
ATTACK.

882
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
AND AMBASSADOR RICE WROTE IN

883
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
THE WASHINGTON POST LAST WEEK,

884
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
THAT SECRETARY CLINTON WAS

885
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
UNAVAILABLE BECAUSE SHE HAD A

886
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
GRUELING WEEK.

887
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
AND THE LOSS OF HER FOUR

888
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
COLLEAGUES WOULD BE GRUELING.

889
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
BUT PRESIDENTS CAN HAVE

890
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
GRUELING WEEKS.

891
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
PRESIDENT ROOSE VET APPEARED

892
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
ON A MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND HE

893
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
HAD A GRUELING DAY.

894
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
AND IT DEPARTMENTIN

895
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
IBCAPACITATE HIM AND NOW

896
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
SENATOR CLINTON CAN'T TESTIFY

897
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
THIS WEEK.

898
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
TWO POINTS DON'T MAKE A

899
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
PATTERN BUT MAKE A LINE.

900
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE

901
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
REPUBLICANS HAVEN'T PUT FEET

902
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
TO THE FIRE AND ISSUED

903
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
SUBPEONAS FOR EVERYONE.

904
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
AND I WISH THEY WOULD PUT THE

905
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
FEET TO THE FIRE AND I WOULD

906
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
HAVE SUBPEONED ERCH. THAT IS

907
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
JUST ME.

908
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
>> SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

909
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
>> STRAIGHT AHEAD, AN AMERICAN

ANY DOUBT IN YOUR MIND THAT IT'S

AUTHENTIC?

928
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
HELPING YOU AT ALL?

929
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
>> WELL, OUR LAWMAKERS ARE...

930
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY LOBBYING

931
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
FOR... THE HELP.
BUT THEY -- I DON'T KNOW THAT

932
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
THEY CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.

00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I THINK AT THIS POINT THAT THE

934
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO HAVE

935
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
TO GET INVOLVED IF IT'S GOING TO

936
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
CHANGE THE SITUATION.

937
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
>> I ACTUALLY AM APPALLED THAT

938
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN INVOLVED

939
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
ALREADY.
THEY COULD HAVE.

940
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
LOOK AT WHAT LIBYA DID.

941
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
LIBYA MANAGED TO GET THEIR MASS

942
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
MURDERER WHO KILLED 270 IN PANAM

943
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
103 OUT OF JAIL AND BROUGHT HIM

944
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
BACK TO LIBYA.

945
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
YOUR SON HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING

946
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
LIKE THAT.

947
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
GOVERNMENTS ALL THE TIME ARE

948
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
WHEELING AND DEALING TO GET

949
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
THEIR PEOPLE BACK.

950
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
SINCE 2008, WE HAVE GIVEN $1.9

951
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
BILLION TO MEXICO.

952
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
SO OUR GOVERNMENT CAN DO

953
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
SOMETHING IF THEY WANT TO.

954
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

955
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I MEAN, I -- WITH A NEW

956
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
ADMINISTRATION IN MEXICO, YOU

957
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
WOULD THINK THAT IT WOULD JUST

958
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
BE A MATTER OF A CONVERSATION.

959
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
>> WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU -- I

960
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
MEAN, HAS ANYONE FROM THE STATE

961
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
DEPARTMENT CONTACTED YOU?

962
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
>> YOU KNOW, WE HAVE HAD LETTERS

963
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT JUST

964
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
SAYING THAT THEY ARE CONSTANTLY

965
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
IN TOUCH WITH THE CONSULATE TO

966
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
ENSURE HIS... PERSONAL SAFETY.

967
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
FOR A WHILE HE WASN'T GETTING

968
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
FOOD.
SO THEY ARE CHECKING ON HIM ON A

969
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
DAILY BASIS TO BE SURE HE'S

970
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
GETTING FED AND TALK TO HIM AND

971
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
FIND OUT IF THERE ARE ANY

972
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
HARASSING THINGS GOING ON.

973
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
BUT OTHER THAN THAT, THEY WILL

974
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
NOT HELP YOU IN ANY WAY IN YOUR

975
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
LEGAL CASE.

976
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
>> I JUST FIND THAT -- I MEAN,

977
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
IT IS SO WRONG.

978
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I MEAN, OUR STATE DEPARTMENT CAN

979
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
HELP YOU.

980
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
THEY CAN DO THAT.

981
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
GOVERNMENTS DO DO THAT.

982
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I DON'T -- I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW

983
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.

984
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
AREN'T YOU OUTRAGED THAT YOU ARE

985
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
NOT GETTING THE HELP FROM THE

986
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
STATE DEPARTMENT?

987
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
>> WE ARE FRUSTRATED, YOU KNOW,

988
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
WE KNOW THAT BEHIND THE SCENES,

989
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
OUR ATTORNEY'S TALKING TO THE

990
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
MEXICAN ATTORNEY GENERAL.

991
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
AND WE KNOW THAT...

992
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
CONGRESSWOMAN HAS BEEN IN TOUCH
WITH THE MEXICAN OFFICIALS.

993
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
BUT WE ARE VERY FRUSTRATED, YES.

994
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
>> BUT FINE.

995
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
THEY ARE ALL TALKING.

996
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
THAT'S GREAT.

997
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
BUT THEY ARE NOT GETTING

998
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
ANYWHERE.
TIME IS UP AND YOUR SON'S BEEN

999
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
THERE SINCE AUGUST.

1000
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I KNOW THERE IS SOME DISCUSSION

1001
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
WHETHER THEY MEASURED THE BARREL

1002
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
WRONG ON THE GUN AND WHETHER OR

1003
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
NOT IT WAS EVEN ILLEGAL.

1004
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, GOVERNMENTS CAN

1005
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
DO THIS.

1006
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
WE HAVE A LOT OF INFLUENCE IN

1007
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
MEXICO.
I HOPE THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT

1008
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
FINALLY STEPS UP TO THE PLATE

1009
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
AND HELPS YOU, SIR.

1010
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
>> THANK YOU.
