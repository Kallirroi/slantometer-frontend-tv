00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
LIGHT ON SCHOOL SAFETY.

375
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
THAT SCHOOL HAD REPORTEDLY

376
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
INSTALLED A NEW SECURITY SYSTEM

377
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
AND DID CONDUCT REGULAR LOCKDOWN

378
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
DRILLS.

379
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
DESPITE THE PRECAUTIONS, THE

380
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
GUNMAN STILL FOUND AND FORCED

381
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
HIS WAY IN ACCORDING TO

382
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
AUTHORITIES.

383
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
JOINING ME IS A FORMER DETECTIVE

384
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
AND TOM, IT'S TIME THAT WE CALL

385
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
YOU TO ASK YOU AS PARENTS AND

386
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
AMERICANS WE CAN DO TO KEEP OUR

387
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
KIDS SAFER.

388
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
COULD IT HAVE BEEN PREVENTED?

389
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
>> NO.

390
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
THERE ARE CERTAIN EVENTS THAT

391
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
HAPPEN IN THIS WORLD.

392
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
WE HAVE VERY SICK PEOPLE, EVIL

393
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
PEOPLE AROUND THIS WORLD WHO ARE

394
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
LOOKING TO DO HARM.

395
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
WE CAN'T PROTECT EVERYTHING.

396
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
YOU CAN'T PROTECT THE PRESIDENT

397
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
OF THE UNITED STATES EVERY

398
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
MOMENT OF THE DAY.

399
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
SO WHAT TO WE DO LOOKING

400
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
FORWARD?

401
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
WE LOOK TOWARDS EACH EXPERIENCE

402
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
THAT HAPPENED.

403
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
FROM COLUMBINE WE KNOW THAT

404
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
POLICE WAITED TOO LONG.

405
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
NOW, THEY HAVE THE ACTIVE

406
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
SHOOTER PROGRAM WHERE POLICE

407
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000

IN TEAMS OF TWO TO STOP WHAT IS

409
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
HAPPENING.

410
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
IT HAPPENED AT A MALL IN

411
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
PORTLAND AND IT HAPPENED

412
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
YESTERDAY.

413
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
A SHOOTING TOOK THREE MINUTES.

414
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
>> Jamie: IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE

415
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
TO FATHOM, ONE PERSON CAN WALK

416
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
IN WITH A NUMBER OF WEAPONS AND

417
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
SHOOT SO MANY PEOPLE TO DEATH IN

418
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

419
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
HOW WELL-TRAINED WOULD THIS

420
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
SUSPECT, THIS SHOOTER HAVE TO

421
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
BE?
>> NOT THAT WELL-TRAINED.

422
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
YOU ARE SHOOTING SITTING DUCKS.

423
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
YOU ARE SHOOTING LITTLE KIDS IN

424
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
THE CLASSROOM.

425
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
HOW WELL DO YOU HAVE TO BE

426
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
TRAINED?

427
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WENT RIGHT

428
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
YESTERDAY.
HE HAD TO FIGHT HIS WAY INTO THE

429
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
SCHOOL.

430
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
FOR A SMALL COMMUNITY, 25,000,

431
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
30,000 PEOPLE HAD SOPHISTICATED

432
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
SYSTEMS THAT WE KNOW IN SCHOOLS

433
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
OR IN INSTITUTIONS TODAY.

434
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
HE HAD TO FIRE HIS WAY IN.

435
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
AT THE POINT IN TIME HE GOT IN,

436
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
THERE WERE TEACHERS AND

437
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
CONVERSATION ON STUDIO "B" ABOUT

438
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
MISS MARTIN.

439
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
HOW ABOUT THE UNSUNG HEROS THAT

440
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
NESTLED THEIR KIDS AND LOCK DOWN

441
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
THE KIDS.

442
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
MOST SCHOOLS AROUND THIS COUNTRY

443
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
AND LEARNING INSTITUTIONS,

444
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
COLLEGES PRACTICE THESE DRILLS.

445
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
THERE IS THE ROBO CALLING WHERE

446
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
NOT ONLY YOU ARE ALERTING THE

447
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
OTHER TEACHERS BUT YOU ARE

448
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
ALERTING THE PARENTS AND LOCAL

449
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
OFFICIALS.
THEN THE POLICE RESPONDED IN

450
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
HUNDREDS WITHIN MINUTES.

451
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
>> Jamie: ALL OF THAT WENT

452
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
RIGHT.

453
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT OTHER

454
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
SCHOOLS.

455
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
SCHOOLS THAT HAVE INSTALLED

456
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
METAL DETECTORS.

457
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
IS IT WORTH IT?

458
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
>> IF YOU FEEL YOU NEED A METAL

459
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
DETECTOR, IT IS ANOTHER WAY.

460
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
COULD THIS GUY HAVE FIRED WITH A

461
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
METAL DETECTOR.

462
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
>> THE ENTRANCE THAT HAS THE

463
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
METAL DETECTER.

464
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
>> IF SOMEONE LET'S HIM IN A

465
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
DIFFERENT WAY, RELATIVE TO THIS,

466
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
THERE IS GOING TO BE TRAGEDIES,

467
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
EVENTS THAT HAPPEN IN THIS

468
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
COUNTRY WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE

469
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
ABLE TO GET OUR HEADS AROUND.

470
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
>> Jamie: YOU CAN LOOK SOMEONE

471
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
IN THE EYE AND HAVE AN EVIL

472
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
DEED.

473
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
SHOULD WE, MANY PARENTS ARE

474
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
CALLING FOR TRAINED ARMED

475
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
PROFESSIONAL AT THE DOOR OF THE

476
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
SCHOOL.

477
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
SHOULD WE INVEST IN THAT IF WE

478
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
ARE ABLE?
>> IF YOU FEEL THE NEED, YES.

479
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
LOOK AT NEW YORK CITY.

480
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
NEW YORK CITY HAS WHOLE DIVISION

481
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
THAT PROTECTS OUR SCHOOLS, HAS

482
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
METAL DETECTORS, HAS A

483
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
COMMANDING OFFICER THAT PROTECTS

484
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
OUR SCHOOLS.

485
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
LOOKING FORWARD WE HAD A

486
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
PRINCIPAL YESTERDAY FROM ALL

487
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
REPORTS WHO RAN TOWARDS THIS MAN

488
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
AND TRIED TO WRESTLE HIM DOWN

489
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
AND TRIED TO STOP HIM.

490
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
SHE LOST HER LIFE.

491
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
THAT COULD HAVE VERY EASILY

492
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
HAPPENED TO AN ARMED OFFICER.

493
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
WE KNOW FROM OUR HISTORY THAT

494
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
ARMED PEOPLE ARE A DETERRENT BUT

495
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
WE HAVE TO LOOK WHAT WE ARE

496
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
GOING TO LEARN FROM THIS

497
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
INCIDENT TO MAKE OUR

498
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
INSTITUTIONS SAFER.

499
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
>> Jamie: DO YOU THINK TEACHERS

500
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
SHOULD BE ABLE TO BEAR ARMS?

501
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
>> I DON'T THINK IT WILL MAKE

502
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
THAT BIG OF A DIFFERENCE.

503
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
THE TEACHERS THAT NESTLED THE

504
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
KIDS IN THE CLASSROOM, AND

505
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
ACCESS CARD SYSTEMS IS WHAT IS

506
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
GOING TO PROTECT OUR SCHOOLS

507
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
BETTER.

508
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
>> Jamie: THANKS FOR HELPING US

509
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
TO KEEP OUR KIDS SAFE.

510
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
>> LET'S SAY A PRAYER.

511
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
>> Rick: THEY ARE HELPING THE

512
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
FAMILIES OF VICTIMS.

513
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
PETER JOHNSON, JR. SPOKE WITH

514
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
HAD HIM.

515
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
HE TALKED ABOUT A CONVERSATION

516
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
HE HAD WITH A LITTLE BOY WHO

517
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
LOST HIS SISTER.

518
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
>> YOU KNOW, I STARTED TALKING

519
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
WITH HIM.

520
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
HE SAID TO ME, I DON'T HAVE

521
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
ANYBODY TO PLAY WITH ANYMORE.

522
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I HAVE LOST MY BEST FRIEND.

523
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I SAID TO HIM, THAT GOD IS GOING

524
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
TO SEND YOU SOME WONDERFUL NEW

525
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
FRIENDS.

526
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.

527
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
YOU ALWAYS HAVE YOUR SISTER IN

528
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
YOUR HEART.

529
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I SAID TO HIM, SHE IS VERY SAFE

530
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
AND SHE IS WITH GOD.

531
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT HEAVEN WAS

532
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
LIKE AND HE REALIZED SHE WAS

533
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
GOING TO BE HAPPY AND SAFE.

534
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER THAT HE

535
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
BROKE DOWN INTO TEARS.

536
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
>> Rick: CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

537
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
HE HAS BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY

538
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
GATHERING WITH PARENTS AT A

539
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
LOCAL FIREHOUSE ON FRIDAY

540
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
EXPERIENCING THE JOY OF THEM OF

541
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
THEM BEING REUNITED WITH THEIR

542
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
CHILDREN AND THEN RECEIVING

543
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
TERRIBLE NEWS THAT SOME ARE NOT

544
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
COMING BACK.

545
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
THERE IS A FREE WITH A CROSS IN

546
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
MEMORY OF EACH OF THE VICTIMS.

547
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
>> Rick: IT'S VERY --.

548
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
>> Jamie: IT'S VERY HARD TO

549
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
REPORT FOR ALL OF US.

550
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
STRAIGHT AHEAD WE'RE GOING TO

551
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
HAVE A LIVE UPDATE FROM THE

552
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING AND A FORMER

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
PROFILER WILL GIVE US INSIGHT

554
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
INTO A MASS MURDERER YOU CAN'T

555
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
CALL IT ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE

556
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
MASSES MURDERER.

557
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE STILL

558
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
SEARCHING FOR MOTIVE, WHY?
This holiday, Share Everything.

559
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
HOPE YOU HAVE ENOUGH COPIES.

749
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
EVERYBODY'S DEATH WAS CAUSED BY

750
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

751
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
OBVIOUSLY THE MANNER OF DEATH ON

752
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
ALL THESE CASES IS HOMICIDE.

753
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
>> HOW MANY MEDICAL EXAMINERS

754
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
WORKED?

755
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
>> I HAVE FOUR DOCTORS.

756
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I THINK ALL TEN OF MY

757
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
TECHNICIANS BOTH FULL TIMERS AND

758
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
PART TIMERS WERE THERE.

759
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
ONE STUDENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY.

760
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
THIS WAS HER FIRST DAY.

761
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
THE MAJORITY OF OUR

762
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
INVESTIGATIVE STAFF WAS WORKING

763
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
ON THIS AT SOME POINT WHETHER

764
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
THEY WERE WITH US LAST NIGHT OR

765
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
ON THE JOB TODAY.

766
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I THINK A LOT OF OUR CLERICAL,

767
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
WHAT THEY CALL PROCESSING PEOPLE

768
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
WERE THERE.

769
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
THEY ARE UP ON THE SECOND FLOOR

770
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
BUT I DIDN'T GET THERE TODAY.

771
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
DID EVERYBODY HEAR THE QUESTION?

772
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
DEALING WITH WHAT I DEAL WITH

773
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
ALL THE TIME, IS THIS ONE OVER

774
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
THE TOP.

775
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I HAVE BEEN AT THIS OVER A THIRD

776
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
OF THE CENTURY.

777
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I MAY NOT BE AVERAGE BUT THIS

778
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
PROBABLY IS THE WORST I HAVE

779
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
SEEN OR THE WORST THAT I KNOW OF

780
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVING

781
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
SEEN.

782
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
THAT ALL THE MORE MAKES ME PROUD

783
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
AND GRATEFUL TO OUR STAFF WHO

784
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
HAVE BEHAVED MOST PROFESSIONALLY

785
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
AND STRONGLY.

786
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I HOPE THEY AND I HOPE THE

787
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
PEOPLE OF NEWTOWN DON'T...

788
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
>> I COULDN'T ANSWER THAT BUT

789
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
ALL THE WOUNDS THAT I KNOW OF AT

790
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
THIS POINT WERE CAUSED BY THE

791
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
LONG WEAPON.

792
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
>> THE RIFLE, WHAT CALIBER?

793
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
>> THE QUESTION WAS WHAT CALIBER

794
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
WERE THESE BULLETS.

795
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I PROBABLY KNOW ABOUT FIREARMS

796
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
THAN MOST PATHOLOGISTS BUT IF I

797
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
SAY IN IT COURT THEY YELL AT ME

798
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
AND DON'T MAKE ME ANSWER.

799
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I WILL LET THE POLICE DEAL WITH

800
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
THAT FOR YOU.

801
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
>> HOW ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE

802
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
WOUNDS, CLOSE RANGE, WERE THE

803
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
CHILDREN WHY SHOT FROM ACROSS

804
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
THE WOUND?

805
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
>> I ONLY DID SEVEN OF THE

806
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
AUTOPSIES.

807
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
VICTIMS I HAD RANGED FROM THREE

808
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
TO 11 WOUNDS APIECE AND ONLY SAW

809
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
TWO OF THEM WITH CLOSE RANGE

810
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
SHOOTING.

811
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
THAT IS A SAMPLE.

812
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I REALLY DON'T HAVE DETAILED

813
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
INFORMATION ON THE REST OF THE

814
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
INJURIES.

815
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
>> IT WAS A LONG RIFLE THAT WAS

816
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
USED?

817
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
>> YES.

818
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
>> I'M LUCKY I CAN TELL YOU HOW

819
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
MANY I FOUND.

820
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I DON'T KNOW.

821
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
THERE WERE LOTS OF THEM.

822
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
OKAY.

823
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
THIS TYPE OF WEAPON IS THE

824
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
BULLETS ARE DESIGNED IN SUCH A

825
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
FASHION THAT THE ENERGY, THIS IS

826
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
VERY CLINICAL BUT THE ENERGY IS

827
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
DEPOSITED IN THE TISSUE SO THE

828
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
BULLETS ARE THERE.

829
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
IT'S ALWAYS A DIFFICULT QUESTION

830
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
AND OBVIOUSLY I DON'T HAVE -- I

831
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
DON'T HAVE DETAILED INFORMATION

832
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
ON ALL OF THEM.

833
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
THIS IS VERY DEVASTATING SET OF

834
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
INJURIES.

835
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
THE BEST OF MY ABILITY TO ANSWER

836
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
THAT QUESTION WHICH IS ALWAYS

837
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
LESS THAN PERFECT, IF SO NOT FOR

838
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
VERY LONG.

839
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
ALL THE ONES -- I BELIEVE SO,

840
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
YES.

841
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
WE DID NOT BRING THE BODIES AND

842
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
FAMILIES INTO CONTACT.

843
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
WE TOOK PICTURES OF THEM OF THE

844
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
FACIAL FEATURES.

845
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
IT'S EASIER ON THE FAMILIES WHEN

846
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
YOU DO THAT.

847
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
THERE IS A TIME AND PLACE IN THE

848
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
GRIEVING PROCESS.

849
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
BUT TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE

850
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST TO DO

851
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
IT THIS WAY.

852
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
YOU CAN CONTROL THE SITUATION

853
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
DEPENDING ON YOUR PHOTOGRAPHER.

854
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I HAVE VERY GOOD PHOTOGRAPHERS.

855
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
NO, I DON'T.

856
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
>> HOW YOUNG WAS THE YOUNGEST

857
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
AND HOW OLD WAS THE OLDEST?

858
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
>> YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE LOOK AT

859
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
THE SPREADSHEET.

860
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
EVERYBODY I SAW, I BELIEVE THEY

861
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
WERE ALL FIRST GRADERS.

862
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
>> I DON'T KNOW YET.

863
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'LL EXAMINE IT TOMORROW

864
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
MORNING.

865
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I DON'T THINK SO.

866
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET.

867
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
OKAY THE COMPANY WILL DEAL WITH

868
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
THAT, PHONE COMPANY IS GOING TO

869
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
HANDLE THAT ONE.

870
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
WE DISCUSSED THIS BRIEFLY WITH

871
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
THE STAFF BEFORE I CAME HERE.

872
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
THERE WAS, I BELIEVE, EVERYBODY

873
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
WAS HIT MORE THAN ONCE.

874
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
>> THE NATURE OF THE SHOOTING

875
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
WAS THERE A LOT OF CARE

876
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
TAKEN....
>> VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION TO

877
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
ANSWER.
>> AS FAR AS THE WOUNDS.

878
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
>> IT'S REALLY, YOU THINK AFTER

879
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
THE THOUSAND OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

880
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
SHOT, I COULD ANSWER THAT

881
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
QUESTION.

882
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
IF I ATTEMPTED TO ANSWER IT IN

883
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
IT COURT THERE WOULD BE AN

884
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
OBJECTION AND THEY WOULD WIN.

885
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
>> THEY WERE WEARING CUTE KID

886
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
STUFF.

887
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
IT'S THE KIND OF STUFF YOU WOULD

888
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
SEND YOUR KIDS OR GRANDKIDS OUT

889
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
THE DOOR TO FIRST GRADE IN.

890
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
THEY WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE WITH

891
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
THE CHILDREN.

892
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
>> THE DOCTOR, THAT YOU DID THE

893
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
AUTOPSY, WHERE ON THE BODIES WAS

894
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
THE WOUNDS?

895
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
>> ALL OVER.

896
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
ALL OVER.

897
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
PARDON?
I HAVE NOT EXAMINED HER YET.

898
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
THAT WILL BE TOMORROW MORNING.

899
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I'LL LET THE SCENE GUYS ADDRESS

900
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
THAT ISSUE.

901
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
OBVIOUSLY I WAS AT THE SCENE AND

902
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I'M EXPERIENCED IN THAT BUT

903
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
THERE ARE PEOPLE NUMBER ONE

904
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
PROFESSIONALS, I'LL LET THEM

905
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
COMMENT.

906
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
>> THE BODIES THAT YOU EXAMINED,

907
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
SEVEN?

908
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
>> THAT IS JUST THE ONES I DID.

909
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I THINK THE GUYS AT THE CRIME

910
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
SCENE.

911
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
>> CAN YOU DESCRIBE HOW YOU DID

912
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
THE AUTOPSIES.

913
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
>> OUR GOAL WAS TO GET THE KIDS

914
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
OUT AND AVAILABLE TO TOT FUNERAL

915
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
DIRECTORS FIRST WELL, OBVIOUSLY.

916
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
>> HOW MANY BOYS AND HOW MANY

917
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
GIRLS?

918
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.

919
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
>> WERE YOU EMOTIONAL AT ANY

920
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
POINT WHERE YOU HAD TO...?

921
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
>> NOT YET.

922
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
YEAH, THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES IN

923
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
MY CAREER FOR REASONS I DON'T

924
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
APPRECIATE GOING INTO A LOCKER

925
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
ROOM AND ASSAULTING.

926
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT YOU

927
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
SHOULDN'T BE IN THIS BUSINESS.

928
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
FOR THIS ONE, NOT YET -- NOTICE

929
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I SAID YET.

930
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
ALL RIGHT FOLKS, THANK YOU VERY

931
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
MUCH.

932
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I HOPE Y'ALL PUT THIS ON YOUR

933
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
CALENDAR BECAUSE IN 31 YEARS, AS

934
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000

IT'S H. WAYNE CARVER AND IT'S

00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
THE SECOND.

939
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
THAT IS WHY I DON'T USE THE

IT'S FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

950
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT.

951
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
THINK IT CAME FROM THE ARMY.

952
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
IT'S WHAT THEY USE FOR SETUP

00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
THAT PROCESS WAS COMPLETED FOR

962
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000

>> ARE LE THEY ADVANCE?

970

OF MY ADMINISTRATION IS THAT WE

972
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000

973
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
UNMARKED AS POSSIBLE.

974
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
WE STARTED OUT AT 6:00.

975
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000

00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
THEY WERE CLEARLY HOMICIDES.

992
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
HE SAID IT WASN'T PROBABLY ONE

993
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000

1126
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
THAT WAS QUITE AN EXTRAORDINARY

1127
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
PRESS CONFERENCE.

1128
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
AS YOU LISTENED WITH YOUR

1129
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
BACKGROUND BUT THE POLICE

1130
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
LIEUTENANT, MEDICAL EXAMINER,

1131
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
THE KINDS OF INJURIES THEY

1132
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
SUSTAINED AND WEAPON USED TO

1133
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
INFLICT THESE INJURIES, WHAT DO

1134

YOU TAKE AWAY?

1135
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
>> THE INFORMATION THAT THEY

1136
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
WERE PUTTING OUT REALLY TAKES

1137
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
YOUR BREATH AWAY.

1138
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
WHAT HE SAID WAS THAT THESE

1139
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
INJURIES WERE EXTREMELY SEVERE.

1140
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
THEY WERE TISSUE INJURIES.

1141
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
THE A.M. MISSION DID EXTENSIVE

1142
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
DAMAGE.
THE VICTIMS WERE SHOT FROM THREE

1143
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
TO 11 TIMES.

1144
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
HE DIDN'T EXPLAIN, HE SAID THE

1145
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
INJURIES WERE ALL OVER.

1146
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
THE INJURIES WERE INFLICTED WHAT

1147
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I UNDERSTAND HIM TO SAY, WAS

1148
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
WHICH REALLY TELLS ME THAT HE

1149
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
WAS VERY INTENT ON MAKING SURE,

1150
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY, HE WAS

1151
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
MAKING SURE THAT HIS VICTIMS

1152
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
DIED.

1153
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
HE WANTED THEM DEAD.

1154
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
THAT IS SOMEONE WHO WENT THERE

1155
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
WITH THE INTENT TO KILL AS MANY

1156
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
PEOPLE AS HE COULD.

1157
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
IT'S REALLY STUNNING.

1158
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
>> Rick: IT IS STUNNING.

1159
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
ASSAULT RIFLE WAS ORIGINALLY

1160
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN LEFT IN

1161
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
THE CAR.
HE USED IT AS HIS PRIMARY

1162
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
WEAPON.
A WEAPON THAT I'M GUESSING MORE

1163
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
SUITABLE FOR MILITARY COMBAT.

1164
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
HERE HE WAS FIRST GRADE

1165
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
CLASSROOM.
WHAT DOES IT SAY AS A PROFILER

1166
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
TO YOU THAT HIS MAIN PRIMARY

1167
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
TARGET WERE YOUNG CHILDREN?

1168
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
>> THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS

1169
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
THAT THAT SAYS.

1170
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
NONE OF THEM ARE GOOD.

1171
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
HE GOES INTO A SCHOOL WITH VERY

1172
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
VULNERABLE VICTIMS, CHILDREN

1173
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
THAT WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO,

1174
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
NOT KNOW HOW TO RESPOND.

1175
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
THEY ARE HELPLESS AND THEY ARE

1176
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
CONTAINED IN A CLASSROOM.

1177
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
SO HE ASSURED HIMSELF HE WAS

1178
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
GOING TO BE ABLE TO KILL A

1179
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

1180
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I THINK IT WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF

1181
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
HIS MOTIVES.

1182
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE AND WE'LL

1183
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
LEARN MORE AS THE INVESTIGATION

1184
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
CONTINUES, THE IDEA THAT THESE

1185
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
YOUNG PEOPLE WERE OBJECTS TO HIM

1186
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
BECOMES MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT

1187
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
TO ME.

1188
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITH SO

1189
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
MANY PEOPLE WITH THAT KIND OF

1190
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
WEAPON WITH THOSE KINDS OF

1191
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
INJURIES GOING FROM CHILD TO

1192
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
CHILD, IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY

1193
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
ESSENTIAL HE WOULD VIEW THESE

1194
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
VICTIMS NOT AS HUMAN BEINGS BUT

1195
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
AS OBJECTS.

1196
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
WHERE DO YOU DEVELOP THAT AS A

1197
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
HUMAN BEING?

1198
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
THAT IS TOTAL DIFFERENT

1199
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
DISCUSSION.
THAT IS WHAT REALLY STRIKES ME

1200
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000

1201
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
