1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
YOUR GRIEF.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
THAT OUR WORLD, TOO, HAS BEEN

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
TORN APART.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
THAT ALL ACROSS THIS LAND OF

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
OURS, WE HAVE WEPT WITH YOU.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
WE'VE PULLED OUR CHILDREN TIGHT,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
AND YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHATEVER

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
MEASURE OF COMFORT WE CAN

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
PROVIDE, WE WILL PROVIDE.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
WHATEVER PORTION OF SADNESS THAT

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU TO EASE

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
THIS HEAVY LOAD, WE WILL GLADLY

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
BEAR IT.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
NEWTOWN, YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
AS THESE DIFFICULT DAYS HAVE

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
UNFOLDED, YOU'VE ALSO INSPIRED

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
US.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
WITH STORIES OF STRENGTH AND

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
RESOLVE AND SACRIFICE.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
WE KNOW THAT WHEN DANGER ARRIVED

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
IN THE HALLS OF SANDY HOOK

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
ELEMENTARY, THE SCHOOL'S STAFF

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
DID NOT FLINCH.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
THEY DID NOT HESITATE.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
DAWN HOCHSPRUNG AND MARY

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
SHERLACH, VICKI SOTO, LAUREN

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
RUSSEAU, RACHEL DAVINO AND ANNE

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
MARIE MURPHY, THEY ALL RESPONDED

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
IN HOW WE HOPE WE ALL WOULD

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
RESPOND IN SUCH TERRIFYING

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
CIRCUMSTANCES, WITH COURAGE AND

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
WITH LOVE, GIVING THEIR LIVES TO

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
PROTECT THE CHILDREN IN THEIR

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
CARE.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE OTHER

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
TEACHERS WHO BARRICADED

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
THEMSELVES INSIDE CLASSROOMS AND

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
KEPT STEADY THROUGH IT ALL AND

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
REASSURED THEIR STUDENTS BY

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
SAYING WAIT FOR THE GOOD GUYS,

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
THEY ARE COMING.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
SHOW ME YOUR SMILE.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
AND WE KNOW THAT GOOD GUYS CAME,

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS WHO RACED

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
TO THE SCENE HELPING TO GUIDE

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
THOSE IN HARM'S WAY TO SAFETY

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
AND COMFORT THOSE IN NEED,

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
HOLDING AT BAY THEIR OWN SHOCK

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
AND THEIR OWN TRAUMA, BECAUSE

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
THEY HAD A JOB TO DO AND OTHERS

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
NEEDED THEM MORE.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
AND THEN THERE WERE THE SCENES

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
OF THE SCHOOL CHILDREN HELPING

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
ONE ANOTHER, HOLDING EACH OTHER,

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
DUTIFULLY FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
IN THE WAY THAT YOUNG CHILDREN

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
SOMETIMES DO.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
ONE CHILD EVEN TRYING TO

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
ENCOURAGE A GROWNUP BY SAYING,

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
"I KNOW KARATE, SO IT'S OKAY,

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'LL LEAD THE WAY OUT."

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
AS A COMMUNITY, YOU'VE INSPIRED

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
US, NEWTOWN.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
IN THE FACE OF INDESCRIBABLE

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
VIOLENCE, IN THE FACE OF

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
UNCONSCIONABLE EVIL, YOU'VE

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
LOOKED OUT FOR EACH OTHER.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
YOU'VE CARED FOR ONE ANOTHER.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
AND YOU'VE LOVED ONE ANOTHER.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
THIS IS HOW NEWTOWN WILL BE

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
REMEMBERED, AND WITH TIME AND

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
GOD'S GRACE, THAT LOVE WILL SEE

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
YOU THROUGH.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
BUT WE AS A NATION, WE ARE LEFT

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
WITH SOME HARD QUESTIONS.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
SOMEONE ONCE DESCRIBED THE JOY

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
AND ANXIETY OF PARENTHOOD AS THE

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
EQUIVALENT OF HAVING YOUR HEART

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
OUTSIDE OF YOUR BODY ALL THE

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
TIME, WALKING AROUND.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
WITH THEIR VERY FIRST CRY, THIS

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
MOST PRECIOUS, VITAL PART OF

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
OURSELVES, OUR CHILD.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
SUDDENLY EXPOSED TO THE WORLD

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
THE POSSIBLE MISHAP OR MALICE,

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
AND EVERY PARENT KNOWS THERE'S

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
NOTHING WE WILL NOT DO TO SHIELD

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
OUR CHILDREN FROM HARM, AND YET

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
WE ALSO KNOW THAT WITH THAT

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
CHILD'S VERY FIRST STEP AND EACH

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
STEP AFTER THAT, THEY ARE

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
SEPARATING FROM US.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
THAT WE WON'T -- THAT WE CAN'T

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
ALWAYS BE THERE FOR THEM.

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
THEY WILL SUFFER SICKNESS AND

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
SETBACKS AND BROKEN HEARTS AND

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
DISAPPOINTMENTS, AND WE LEARN

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
THAT OUR MOST IMPORTANT JOB IS

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
BECOME SELF RELIANT AND CAPABLE

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
AND RESILIENT, READY TO FACE THE

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
WORLD WITHOUT FEAR.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
AND WE KNOW WE CAN'T DO THIS BY

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
OURSELVES.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
IT COMES AS A SHOCK AT A CERTAIN

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
POINT WHERE YOU REALIZE NO

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
MATTER HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THESE

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
KIDS, YOU CAN'T DO IT BY

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
YOURSELF.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
THAT THIS JOB OF KEEPING OUR

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
CHILDREN SAFE AND TEACHING THEM

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
WELL IS SOMETHING WE CAN ONLY DO
TOGETHER.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
WITH THE HELP OF FRIENDS AND

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
NEIGHBORS, THE HELP OF A

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
COMMUNITY AND THE HELP OF A

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
NATION.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
AND IN THAT WAY WE COME TO

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
REALIZE THAT WE BEAR

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERY CHILD,

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
BECAUSE WE'RE COUNTING ON

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
EVERYBODY ELSE TO HELP LOOK

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
AFTER OURS.

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
THAT WE'RE ALL PARENTS, THAT

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
THEY ARE ALL OUR CHILDREN.

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
THIS IS OUR FIRST TASK, CARING

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
FOR OUR CHILDREN.

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
OUR FIRST JOB.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
IF WE DON'T GET THAT RIGHT, WE

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
DON'T GET ANYTHING RIGHT.

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
THAT'S HOW, AS A SOCIETY, WE
WILL BE JUDGED.

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
AND BY THAT MEASURE, CAN WE

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
TRULY SAY, AS A NATION, THAT

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
WE'RE MEETING OUR OBLIGATIONS?

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
CAN WE HONESTLY SAY THAT WE'RE

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
DOING ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
CHILDREN, ALL OF THEM, SAFE FROM

138
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
HARM?

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
CAN WE CLAIM, AS A NATION, THAT

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
WE'RE ALL TOGETHER THERE,

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
LETTING THEM KNOW THEY ARE LOVED

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
AND TEACHING THEM TO LOVE IN

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
RETURN?

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
CAN WE SAY THAT WE'RE TRULY

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
DOING ENOUGH TO GIVE ALL THE

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
CHILDREN OF THIS COUNTRY THE

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
CHANCE THEY DESERVE TO LIVE OUR

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
THEIR LIVES IN HAPPINESS AND

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
WITH PURPOSE?

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'VE BEEN REFLECTING ON THIS THE

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
LAST FEW DAYS, AND IF WE'RE

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
HONEST WITH OURSELVES, THE

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
ANSWER'S NO.

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH.

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
AND WE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE.

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
SINCE I'VE BEEN PRESIDENT, THIS

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
IS THE FOURTH TIME WE HAVE COME

158
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
TOGETHER TO COMFORT A GRIEVING

159
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
COMMUNITY TORN APART BY MASS

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
SHOOTINGS.

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
FOURTH TIME WE'VE HUGGED

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
SURVIVORS, THE FOURTH TIME WE'VE

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
CONSOLED THE FAMILIES OF

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
VICTIMS, AND IN BETWEEN, THERE

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
HAVE BEEN AN ENDLESS SERIES OF

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
DEADLY SHOOTINGS ACROSS THE

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
COUNTRY, DAILY REPORTS OF

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
VICTIMS, MANY OF THEM CHILDREN,

169
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
IN SMALL TOWNS AND CITIES ALL

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
ACROSS AMERICA.

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
VICTIMS WHO MUCH OF THE TIME

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
THEIR ONLY FAULT WAS BEING AT

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
TIME.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
WE CAN'T TOLERATE THIS ANYMORE.

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
THESE TRAGEDIES MUST END.

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
AND TO END THEM, WE MUST CHANGE.

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
WE WILL BE TOLD THAT THE CAUSES

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
OF SUCH VIOLENCE ARE COMPLEXED,

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
AND THAT IS TRUE.

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
NO SINGLE LAW, NO SET OF LAWS

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
CAN ELIMINATE EVIL FROM THE

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
WORLD OR PREVENT EVERY SENSELESS

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
ACT OF VIOLENCE IN OUR SOCIETY,

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
BUT THAT CAN'T BE AN EXCUSE FOR

186
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
AN ACTION.

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
SURELY WE CAN DO BETTER THAN

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
THIS.

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
IF THERE'S EVEN ONE STEP WE CAN

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
TAKE TO SAVE ANOTHER CHILD OR

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
ANOTHER PARENT OR ANOTHER TOWN

192
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
FROM THE GRIEF THAT'S VISITED

193
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
TUCSON AND AURORA AND OAK CREEK

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
AND NEWTOWN AND COMMUNITIES FROM

195
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
COLUMBINE TO BLACKSBURG BEFORE

196
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
THAT, THEN SURELY WE HAVE AN

197
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
OBLIGATION TO TRY.

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
IN THE COMING WEEKS, I'LL USE

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE HOLDS

200
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
TO ENGAGE MY FELLOW CITIZENS,

201
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, TO MENTAL

202
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, TO PARENTS

203
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
WE CAN'T ACCEPT EVENTS LIKE THIS

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
AS ROUTINE.

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
ARE WE REALLY PREPARED TO SAY

206
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
THAT WE'RE POWERLESS IN THE FACE

207
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
OF SUCH CARNAGE?

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
THAT THE POLITICS ARE TOO HARD.

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
ARE WE PREPARED TO SAY THAT SUCH

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
VIOLENCE VISITED ON OUR CHILDREN

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR IS

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
SOMEHOW THE PRICE OF OUR

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
FREEDOM?

214
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
YOU KNOW, ALL THE WORLD'S

215
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
RELIGIONS, SO MANY OF THEM

216
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
REPRESENTED HERE TODAY, START

217
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
WITH A SIMPLE QUESTION.

218
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
WHY ARE WE HERE?

219
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
WHAT GIVES OUR LIFE MEANING?

220
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
WHAT GIVES OUR ACTS PURPOSE?

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
WE KNOW OUR TIME ON THIS EARTH

222
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
IS FLEETING.

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
WE KNOW THAT WE WILL EACH HAVE

224
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
OUR SHARE OF PLEASURE AND PAIN,

225
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
THAT EVEN AFTER WE CHASE AFTER

226
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
SOME EARTHLY GOAL, WHETHER IT'S

227
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
WEALTH OR POWER OR FAME OR JUST

228
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
SIMPLE COMFORT, WE WILL, IN SOME

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
FASHION, FALL SHORT OF WHAT WE

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
HAD HOPED.

231
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
WE KNOW THAT NO MATTER HOW GOOD

232
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
OUR INTENTIONS, WE'LL ALL

233
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
STUMBLE SOMETIMES IN SOME WAY.

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
WE'LL MAKE MISTAKES, WE'LL

235
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
EXPERIENCE HARDSHIPS, AND EVEN

236
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO DO THE

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
RIGHT THING, WE KNOW THAT MUCH

238
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
OF OUR TIME WILL BE SPENT

239
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
GROPING THROUGH THE DARKNESS, SO

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
OFTEN UNABLE TO DISCERN GOD'S

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
HEAVENLY PLANS.

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING WE CAN BE

243
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
SURE OF, AND THAT IS THE LOVE

244
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
THAT WE HAVE.

245
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
FOR OUR CHILDREN, FOR OUR

246
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
FAMILIES, FOR EACH OTHER.

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
THE WARMTH OF A SMALL CHILD'S

248
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
EMBRACE, THAT IS TRUE.

249
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
THE MEMORIES WE HAVE OF THEM,

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
THE JOY THAT THEY BRING, THE

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
WONDER WE SEE THROUGH THEIR

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
EYES, THAT FIERCE AND BOUNDLESS

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
LOVE WE FEEL FOR THEM, A LOVE

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
THAT TAKES US OUT OF OURSELVES

255
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
AND BINDS US TO SOMETHING

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
LARGER.

257
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
WE KNOW THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

258
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
WE KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS DOING RIGHT

259
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
WHEN WE'RE TAKING CARE OF THEM.

260
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
WHEN WE'RE TEACHING THEM WELL.

261
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
WHEN WE'RE SHOWING ACTS OF

262
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
KINDNESS.

263
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
WE DON'T GO WRONG WHEN WE DO

264
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
THAT.

265
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
THAT'S WHAT WE CAN BE SURE OF,

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU, THE PEOPLE

267
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000

268
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
THAT'S HOW YOU'VE INSPIRED US.

YOU REMIND US WHAT MATTERS.

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
AND THAT'S WHAT SHOULD DRIVE US

271
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
FORWARD IN EVERYTHING WE DO FOR

272
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
AS LONG AS GOD SEES FIT TO KEEP

273
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
US ON THIS EARTH.

274
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
LET THE LITTLE CHILDREN COME TO

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
ME, JESUS SAID, AND DO NOT

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
CLERGY ASSOCIATION, WE ARE SO

300
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
GRATEFUL TO OUR PRESIDENT FOR

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
SPENDING TIME WITH US AND FOR

302
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
REMINDING US THAT WE ARE NOT

303
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
ALONE IN THIS TIME OF TRAGEDY,

304
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
THAT THERE'S NOT JUST A COUNTRY

305
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
STANDING BEHIND US, THAT THERE'S
A WORLD STANDING BEHIND US.

306
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
THOSE WORDS I KNOW AS DIFFICULT

307
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
AS THEY WERE TO HEAR FOR SOME,

308
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
BROUGHT MUCH CONSOLATION TO ALL.

309
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I WANT TO THANK OUR GOVERNOR AND

310
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
ALL THE STATE OFFICIALS WHO HAVE

311
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
BEEN BY OUR SIDE SINCE DAY ONE.

312
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
THEY HAVE BEEN A REMARKABLE

313
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
REMINDER TO US OF THEIR HUMANITY
AND THEIR CARE FOR US.

314
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
BUT MOST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK

315
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
AN INCREDIBLE FIRST-SELECT WOMAN

316
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
WHO'S LED US THROUGH THE MOST

317
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
DARK PERIODS OF OUR LIVES.

318
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000

RAVAGED OUR COMMUNITY WITHOUT

320
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
POWER FOR DAYS, I THOUGHT THOSE

321
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
WERE THE HARDEST DAYS OF PAT'S

322
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
LIFE, BUT WHEN I SAW HER FRIDAY

323
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
IN FRONT OF SANDY HOOK SCHOOL, I

324
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
REALIZED THAT SHE'D MET THE MOST

325
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
DARK DAYS.

326
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000

PRAYER IS FOR US, THE PEOPLE OF

331
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
NEWTOWN.

332

>> THESE ARE THE WORDS OF THE

APOSTLE PAUL AS HE WRITES TO THE

CHURCH AT ROME.

335
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
WHAT THEN SHALL WE SAY IN

336
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
RESPONSE TO THIS, IF GOD IS FOR

337
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
US, WHO CAN BE AGAINST US?

338
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
HE WHO DID NOT SPARE HIS OWN

339
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
SON, BUT GAVE HIM UP FOR ALL OF

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
US, HOW WILL HE NOT ALSO ALONG

341
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
WITH HIM GRACIOUSLY GIVE US ALL

342
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
THINGS?

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
WHO WILL BRING ANY CHARGE

AGAINST THOSE WHOM GOD HAS

345
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
CHOSEN, THAT IS GOD WHO

JUSTIFIES, WHO IS HE THAT

347
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
CONDEMNS?

348

CHRIST JESUS WHO DIED, MORE THAN

349
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
THAT WHO WAS RAISED TO LIFE, WAS

350
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD AND IS

351
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
ALSO INTERCEDING FOR US.

352
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
WHO SHALL SEPARATE US FROM THE

LOVE OF CHRIST, SHALL TROUBLE OR

SAKE, WE FACE DEATH ALL DAY

TO BE SLAUGHTERED.

360
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
KNOW IN ALL THESE THINGS WE ARE

361
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
MORE THAN CONQUERERS THROUGH HIM

WHO LOVED US, FOR I AM CONVINCED

363
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
THAT NEITHER DEATH, NOR LIFE,

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
CREATION WILL BE ABLE TO

369
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
SEPARATE US FROM THE LOVE OF GOD

370
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
THAT IS IN CHRIST JESUS OUR

371
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
SHE WAS EXTREMELY CLOSE TO HER

745
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
SIBLINGS THAT ARE SITTING WITH

746
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
ME, HER COUSINS, AND LOVED THEM

747
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
DEARLY.

748
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
AND WANTED TO BE A TEACHER FROM

749
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
THE TIME SHE WAS 3.

750
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
THAT'S ALL SHE EVER WANTED TO

751
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
DO.

752
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
SHE JUST LOVED HER KIDS.

753
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
SHE JUST TALKED ABOUT THEM ALL

754
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
THE TIME WITH SUCH FONDNESS AND

755
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
CARING, AND SHE JUST ADORED

756
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
THEM.

757
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND

758
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
SHE DID EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO

759
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
PROTECT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

760
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
THEM.

761
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
>> WHAT SHE DID WAS INCREDIBLY

762
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
HEROIC, AND SHE SAVED MANY LIVES

763
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
WITH HER ACTIONS.

764
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
KNOWING HER, AS HER MOTHER, AS

765
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
WELL AS ANYBODY IN THE WORLD

766
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
KNEW HER, DID IT SURPRISE YOU

767
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
THAT SHE WAS SO COURAGEOUS IN

768
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
SUCH A TERRIFYING MOMENT?

769
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
>> NOT AT ALL.

770
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
SHE WAS TRULY SELFLESS.

771
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
SHE WOULD NOT HESITATE TO THINK

772
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
TO SAVE ANYONE ELSE BEFORE

773
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
HERSELF, AND ESPECIALLY

774
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
CHILDREN.

775
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
SHE LOVED THEM MORE THAN LIFE,

776
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
AND SHE WOULD DEFINITELY PUT

777
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
HERSELF IN FRONT OF THEM ANY

778
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
DAY, ANY DAY AND FOR ANY REASON.

779
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ANYBODY THAT

780
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
KNOWS VICKI THAT SHE DID THIS.

781
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
>> CARLY, VICKI WAS YOUR SISTER,

782
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
YOU WERE ALL VERY CLOSE, AS YOUR

783
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
MOTHER JUST SAID.

784
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A TERRIBLE,

785
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
TORRENTIAL LOSS, YOU MUST BE

786
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
GRIEVING HORRIBLY, YET AT THE

787
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
SAME TIME HEARING THE PRESIDENT

788
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
OF THE UNITED STATES TALK ABOUT

789
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
YOUR SISTER AS A HERO, IT MUST

790
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
HAVE BEEN VERY MOVING TO YOU.

791
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
>> IT WAS VERY MUCH.

792
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I APPRECIATE ALL HIS KIND WORDS

793
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
THAT HE DID SAY ABOUT MY SISTER.

794
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
SHE WAS A HERO, AND SHE STILL

795
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
IS.

796
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
>> WHAT KIND OF PERSON WAS SHE,

797
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
CARLEE?

798
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
>> SHE WAS SO CARING.

799
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
SHE PUT ANYBODY ELSE BEFORE HER.

800
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
SHE WANTED THE BEST FOR

801
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
EVERYONE.

802
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
SHE JUST LOVED LIFE, AND SHE

803
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
LOVED TEACHING.

804
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
>> AND JILLIAN, YOU'RE ALL

805
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
WEARING GREEN BECAUSE THAT WAS

806
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
VICKI'S FAVORITE COLOR, AND I

807
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
HEARD YOU SAY THIS MORNING THAT

808
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
WHEN IT SNOWED, YOU FELT IT WAS

809
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
IN SOME WAY A SIGNAL FROM YOUR

810
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
SISTER.

811
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
>> IT WAS.

812
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
IT'S LIKE HER LOOKING DOWN AT US

813
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
AND LETTING US KNOW THAT SHE'S

814
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
HERE WITH US AND SHE LOVED THE

815
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY.

816
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
SHE LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT,

817
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
THE SNOW THAT COMES WITH IT, SO

818
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
WHEN IT STARTED TO HAIL, THE

819
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
THREE OF US KNEW IT WAS OUR

820
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
SISTER SAYING THAT I'M HERE WITH

821
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
YOU GUYS, EVEN THROUGH ALL OF

822
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
THIS.

823
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
GREEN IS HER FAVORITE COLOR.

824
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
>> I'M SORRY.
>> WE JUST WANTED TO WEAR THE

825
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
GREEN TO SHOW HOW MUCH WE LOVE

826
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
HER AND HONOR HER FOR IT.

827
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
>> CARLOS, YOU WERE VICKI'S

828
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
BROTHER.

829
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
WHEN YOU HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED

830
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
AT THE SCHOOL, IT MUST HAVE

831
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
BEEN, I IMAGINE, THE WORST

832
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE.

833
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
TRY AND SUM UP FOR ME WHAT IT'S

834
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
BEEN LIKE FOR YOU AS A FAMILY

835
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
SINCE THIS DREADFUL, DREADFUL

836
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
MOMENT HAPPENED.

837
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
>> IT'S JUST BEEN HORRIBLE.

838
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
THERE'S BEEN SO MANY PEOPLE HERE

839
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
TO SUPPORT US, AND I REALLY

840
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
THINK THAT SHE WANTED US TO COME

841
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
BACK TOGETHER.

842
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
AND WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN CLOSE, BUT

843
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
SHE'S JUST GOING TO BRING US

844
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
CLOSER, AND I KNOW WE'LL ALWAYS

845
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
REMEMBER HER FOR THIS.

846
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
>> AND CARLOS, HOW DO YOU FEEL

847
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
ABOUT THE WAY THE COMMUNITY HAS

848
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
RALLIED TOGETHER?

849
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
THE PRESIDENT NOTICED THIS,

850
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
YOU'VE COME TOGETHER AS A

851
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
COMMUNITY, NOT JUST THOSE WHO

852
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
HAVE LOST PEOPLE, BUT JUST THE

853
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
WHOLE COMMUNITY.

854
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
AND YOU'VE BEEN JOINED BY

855
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
AMERICA, I THINK, THAT'S BEEN

856
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
SHATTERED BY WHAT'S HAPPENED,

857
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
FROM THE PRESIDENT DOWN.

858
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN

859
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
WITH NEWTOWN NOW?
HOW WILL THEY RECOVER FROM THIS?

860
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
>> I DON'T THINK IT WILL EVER BE

861
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
A FULL RECOVERY.

862
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I KNOW THAT THESE 27 PEOPLE THAT

863
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
LOST THEIR LIVES WILL BE

864
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
REMEMBERED AND WILL BE MISSED TO

865
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
THE FULLEST, AND I JUST -- IT'S

866
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
JUST SO THANKFUL TO KNOW THAT

867
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
EVERYONE IN STRATFORD HAS BEEN

868
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
TOUCHED BY HER LIFE SOMEHOW AND

869
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
CAME HERE TO CELEBRATE HER LIFE.

870
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
>> I UNDERSTAND, DONNA, THAT

871
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
CARLEE MET WITH THE PRESIDENT

872
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
TODAY.
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT?

873
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
>> WE ALL MET WITH THE PRESIDENT

874
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
TODAY.

875
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
IT WAS -- HE WAS VERY, VERY

876
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
CARING AND VERY SUPPORTIVE AND

877
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
TOLD US HE KNEW ALL ABOUT VICKI

878
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
AND WHAT SHE DID AND WHAT A HERO

879
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
SHE WAS.

880
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
AND SHE WAS JUST VERY, VERY KIND

881
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
TO US AND GAVE US THE TIME WE

882
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
NEEDED WITH HIM, AND IT WAS --

883
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
IT WAS VERY COMFORTING.

884
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
>> AND JAMES, YOU WERE VICKI'S

885
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
COUSIN, YOU'RE ALSO A POLICE

886
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
OFFICER.

887
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
IT WAS VERY NOTICEABLE IN THE

888
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH TONIGHT THAT

889
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
HE SEEMS, ALTHOUGH HE NEVER

890
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
MENTIONED THE WORD GUNS, HE'S

891
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
DETERMINED TO DO WHATEVER HE

892
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
CAN, HE SAID, TO TRY AND PREVENT

893
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
ANOTHER SHOOTING TRAGEDY LIKE

894
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
THIS.

895
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
AND MANY ARE TAKING THIS TO MEAN

896
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
GUN CONTROL, WHATEVER IT MAY BE.

897
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION AS A

898
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
POLICEMAN TO WHAT HE WAS SAYING
THERE?

899
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
>> I GOT TO BE HONEST, I DIDN'T

900
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
SEE OR HEAR HIS SPEECH YET.

901
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
WE -- AFTER WE MET WITH HIM, HE

902
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
WAS JUST LOVE AND SUPPORT FROM

903
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
HIM WAS COMFORTING FOR THE
FAMILY.

904
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I GOT THE FAMILY BACK HERE TO

905
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
STRATFORD.

906
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
TO TRY AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,

907
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
JUST AS ANY OTHER ISSUE, I WOULD

908
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
HAVE TO SAY AWARENESS,

909
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
AWARENESS, AWARENESS.

910
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
FRIENDS, FAMILY, GUN SUPPORTERS,

911
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
PEOPLE THAT OPPOSE GUNS, JUST

912
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
AWARENESS.

913
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
AND BEING AWARE OF YOUR

914
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
SURROUNDINGS.

915
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
>> I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR
--

916
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO
SAY.

917
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
>> LISTEN, I DON'T WANT TO PRESS

918
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
YOU ON THIS.

919
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
IT'S NOT THE TIME FOR YOU AS A

920
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
FAMILY TO CONSIDER THESE THINGS.

921
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
IT WILL BE FOR THE PRESIDENT AND

922
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
POLITICIANS, I THINK, TO DO WHAT

923
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

924
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR

925
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
TAKING THE TIME TO JOIN ME THIS

926
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
EVENING AND JUST TO SEND YOU ON

927
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
BEHALF OF EVERYONE AT CNN AND

928
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
AMERICA THAT'S BEEN THINKING OF

929
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

930
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
VICKI WAS A HEROINE, TRUE

931
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
AMERICAN, YOUR LOSS IS APPALLING

932
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
BUT HER LEGACY AND MEMORY WILL

933
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
LIVE ON FOR A VERY, VERY LONG

934
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
TIME.

935
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

936
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
>> THANK YOU.

937
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
>> THANK YOU.

938
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
>> BRAVE FAMILY.

939
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I WANT TO BRING YOU WOLF

940
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
BLITZER, WHO'S ON THE SCENE OF
TONIGHT'S VIGIL.

941
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
WOLF, IT'S A PRETTY UNBEARABLE

942
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
STORY, THIS, TO COVER.

943
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
YOU CAN ONLY BEGIN TO IMAGINE

944
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
WHAT ON EARTH THESE FAMILIES ARE

945
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
GOING THROUGH.

946
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE

947
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH TONIGHT?

948
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
VERY EMOTIONAL, PRETTY

949
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
DETERMINED, AND ALTHOUGH HE

950
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
DIDN'T MENTION THE WORD GUNS,

951
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
PRETTY OBVIOUS, I THINK, HE'S

952
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
GOING TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING

953
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
FAIRLY DRAMATIC TO TRY AND DO

954
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
SOMETHING, AS HE PUT IT, DOING

955
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
NOTHING IS NOT AN OPTION
ANYMORE.

956
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
>> Reporter: HE SAYS HE'S GOING

957
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
TO USE EVERY OPPORTUNITY HE HAS

958
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
WITH THE POWER OF HIS OFFICE,

959
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED

960
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
STATES, TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THIS

961
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

962
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
EVEN IF HE CAN SAVE ONE OR TWO

963
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
OR THREE YOUNG KIDS, HE WANTS TO

964
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
DO IT.

965
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
AND IT WAS A CLEAR REFERENCE, I

966
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT,

967
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
PIERS, WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS

968
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
TALKING ABOUT, EVEN THOUGH HE

969
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
DIDN'T SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, WE

970
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
MUST, YOU KNOW, GET NEW GUN

971
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
LEGISLATION TO CONTROL GUNS IN

972
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
THE UNITED STATES, THE ASSAULT

973
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
WEAPONS BAN OR WHATEVER, THAT'S

974
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
CLEARLY WHAT HE'S DRIVING AT AND

975
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
WHAT HE'S GOING TO TRY TO DO.

976
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
WHETHER OR NOT HE SUCCEEDS IS

977
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
ANOTHER MANNER.

978
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
AS YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF

979
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
OPPOSITION TO A MUCH GREATER GUN

980
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
CONTROL IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT I

981
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
THINK HE'S GOING TO TRY.

982
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
HE DIDN'T TRY DURING THE FIRST

983
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
FOUR YEARS.

984
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
THERE WERE A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES

985
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
ON HIS AGENDA, INCLUDING A U.S.

986
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
ECONOMY THAT WAS NEAR, NOT ONLY

987
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
RECESSION, BUT POTENTIALLY

988
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
ANOTHER DEPRESSION.

989
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
A LOT GOING ON, TWO WARS.

990
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
BUT RIGHT NOW, HAVING JUST BEEN

991
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
REELECTED, HAVING JUST GONE

992
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
THROUGH WHAT WE HEARD ONE OF THE

993
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
MINISTERS SAY, ONE OF THE PEOPLE

994
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
WHO MET WITH HIM, THIS PAST

995
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
FRIDAY WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT WHAT

996
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
HAPPENED AT THAT ELEMENTARY

997
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
SCHOOL HERE IN NEWTOWN,

998
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
CONNECTICUT, THE WORST DAY OF

999
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
HIS PRESIDENCY, I THINK THERE'S

1000
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
NO DOUBT HE'S GOING TO TRY TO DO

1001
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
SOMETHING IN THIS SECOND TERM AS

1002
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
FAR AS GUN CONTROL IS CONCERNED.

1003
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
THAT WILL BE A PRIORITY.

1004
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
HE WANTS TO USE THE OFFICE OF

1005
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
THE PRESIDENCY TO TRY TO SAVE

1006
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
SOME LIVES, AND I THINK HE'S

1007
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
GOING TO DO THE BEST HE CAN ON
THIS AREA.

1008
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'LL SUCCEED,

1009
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
BECAUSE THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE,

1010
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
AS YOU KNOW, IN THE U.S. SENATE,

1011
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

1012
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
BUT HE'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.

1013
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

1014
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
AND I THINK HE'S PICKED UP ON

1015
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
WHAT'S A NATIONAL MOOD THAT I

1016
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
DETECT AFTER THIS PARTICULAR

1017
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
HORRIFYING INCIDENT, ONE OF THE

1018
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
WORST YOU COULD POSSIBLY

1019
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
IMAGINE.

1020
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I DETECT THERE'S A DIFFERENT

1021
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
MOOD ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND ACTION

1022
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
HAS TO BE TAKEN.

1023
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ARE GOING TO
DEMAND IT.

1024
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
WOLF, FOR NOW, THANK YOU VERY

1025
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
MUCH INDEED.

1026
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
>>> THE TRAGEDY IN NEWTOWN

1027
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
RAISES DIFFICULT AND PAINFUL

1028
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS PEOPLE

1029
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE ALL

1030
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
WRESTLING WITH TONIGHT.

1031
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
WHEN WE COME BACK, A CONSULTANT

1032
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
ON MANY MASS SHOOTINGS.

1033
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
WHAT HE NOW THINKS.

1034
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
>>> WITH CANDLES, FLOWERS, AND

1035
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
CARDS, PEOPLE GATHERED TONIGHT

1036
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
AT A MEMORIAL FOR THE VICTIMS IN

1037
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
NEWTOWN.

1038
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
WE'RE LEARNING MORE DETAILINGS

1039
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
ABOUT THE GUNMAN, ADAM LANZA.

1040
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
JOINING ME IS AMADOR, HE'S

1041
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
CONSULTED ON MANY MASS SHOOTINGS

1042
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
IN THE PAST.

1043
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
WE SPOKE ON FRIDAY.

1044
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
RIGHT AT THE TOP, I WANT TO TALK

1045
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
ABOUT SOMETHING WE DISCUSSED,

1046
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
WHICH IS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

1047
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
MENTAL ILLNESS THAT THIS YOUNG

1048
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
MAN SUFFERED FROM.

1049
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
IT'S SUGGESTED THAT IT IS

1050
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
POSSIBLY ASBERGERS, A FORM OF

1051
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
AUTISM.

1052
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
CLARIFY THAT AND CLARIFY WHETHER

1053
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
THERE'S ANY REAL SCIENCE THAT

1054
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
SUGGEST PEOPLE THAT HAVE THAT

1055
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
KIND OF CONDITION MIGHT BE

1056
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
VIOLENT.

1057
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
>> THERE IS NONE.

1058
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE

1059
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
THAT IF YOU HAVE ASBERGER'S,

1060
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE VIOLENT

1061
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

1062
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I GOT SOME E-MAILS AND BLOGS

1063
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
AFTER OUR LAST CONVERSATION.

1064
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I DIDN'T INTEND TO SAY PEOPLE

1065
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
WITH ASBERGER'S LACK EMPATHY,

1066
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
THEY LACK THE ABILITY TO JUDGE

1067
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
SOCIAL CUES.

1068
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I LOOK AT YOU LIKE YOU'RE

1069
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
LOOKING AT ME, IT MAY LOOK LIKE

1070
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I DON'T HAVE EMPATHY, I WANTED

1071
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
TO CLARIFY THAT AS WELL.

1072
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
>> MORE AND MORE DETAIL

1073
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
EMERGING, NO SIGN OF MOTIVE.

1074
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
KILLED HIS MOTHER, WENT TO THE

1075
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
SCHOOL AND CLEARLY LOOKS LIKE HE

1076
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
PLANNED IT QUITE CAREFULLY.

1077
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
THE FBI SEIZED A COMPUTER.

1078
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY KNOW IS

1079
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
HE WAS PLAYING PRETTY VIOLENT

1080
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
VIDEO GAMES, REENACTING BATTLE

1081
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
SCENES WITH GRAPHIC CHARACTERS

1082
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
AND SO ON.

1083
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I WAS DEBATING THIS ON TWITTER

1084
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
TODAY, IF YOU'RE WATCHING AND

1085
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN ANY OF

1086
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
THIS, TELL ME, MANY HAVE BEEN

1087
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
STRONG ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS.

1088
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
PEOPLE SAYING THERE'S NO LINK

1089
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
BETWEEN ANY OF THIS AND ANYONE

1090
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
WATCHING VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES,

1091
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
BUT HERE'S MY QUESTION.

1092
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
IN ALL YOUR EXPERIENCE, IF

1093
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
SOMEBODY IS MENTALLY ILL,

1094
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
MENTALLY UNSTABLE, VULNERABLE,

1095
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
IF YOU LIKE, AND THEY ARE

1096
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
WATCHING VERY VIOLENT VIDEO

1097
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
GAMES A LOT, CAN IT STIMULATE

1098
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
THEM, DOES IT DESENSITIZE THEM,

1099
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
CAN IT BE PART OF THE

1100
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
PROVOCATION, IF YOU LIKE, FOR

1101
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
MAKING THEM GO AND DO AN

1102
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
ATROCITY?

1103
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S PART OF
THE PROVOCATION.

1104
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
LET ME SAY SOMETHING.

1105
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL

1106
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
ILLNESS, DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE

1107
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
MENTALLY UNSTABLE.

1108
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN

1109
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
TREATMENT WITH SERIOUS MENTAL

1110
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
ILLNESSES LIKES ABERGER'S,

1111
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
SCHIZOPHRENIA, BIPOLAR, ARE

1112
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
STABLE, LIVING PRODUCTIVE LIVES,

1113
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
ARE WORKING.

1114
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT
THAT.

1115
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
WHAT HAPPENS, I LOOK AT THAT

1116
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
RESEARCH FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

1117
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO BAN --

1118
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
>> THE HEADLINE IS THAT, YES,

1119
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
WHEN YOU'RE ENGAGED IN, YOU

1120
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
KNOW, VERY VIVID VIDEOS WHERE

1121
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
YOU'RE SHOOTING PEOPLE, KILLING

1122
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
PEOPLE, WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE

1123
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
DESENSITIZED TO WHAT IT MEANS TO

1124
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
PULL A TRIGGER.

1125
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
CERTAINLY, THE SCIENCE THERE IS

1126
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
VERY GOOD, BUT A LOT OF THAT

1127
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
RESEARCH IS FLAWED IN THAT

1128
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
PEOPLE ARE SELECTED NOT -- YOU

1129
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
CAN'T KNOW AHEAD OF TIME IF THE

1130
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE DRAWN TO THESE

1131
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
GAMES ARE ALREADY PEOPLE PRONE

1132
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
TO VIOLENCE AND AGGRESSION,

1133
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
REGARDLESS OF THE ISSUE OF

1134
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
MENTAL ILLNESS.

1135
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
>> PEOPLE WHO PLAY THESE GAMES

1136
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
ARE PERFECTLY NORMAL, WHATEVER

1137
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
NORMAL MEANS THESE DAYS, AND IT

1138
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
HAS NO AFFECT ON THEM, I TOTALLY

1139
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
ACCEPT THAT.

1140
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
ANOTHER ARGUMENT THAT'S BEEN

1141
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
RAISING, MORGAN FREEMAN, THE

1142
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
ACTOR, BLAMED THE MEDIA FOR ALL

1143
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
OF THIS, COPYCAT SYNDROME, THE

1144
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
MEDIA, BY MAKING AS HE PUT IT

1145
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
ALMOST LIKE GROTESQUE HEROS OF

1146
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
THESE PEOPLE BY CONSTANTLY

1147
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
NAMING THEM, SOMEHOW PROPAGATE

1148
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
THIS ONGOING SITUATION WITH SO

1149
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
MANY MASS SHOOTINGS.

1150
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
DO YOU THINK HE'S RIGHT?

1151
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I MEAN, I DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM

1152
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
RULING OUT GUN CONTROL --
>> I DON'T THINK HE'S RIGHT.

1153
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
>> IS HE RIGHT?

1154
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
>> NO, HE'S NOT.
I'LL BLAME THE MEDIA FOR ONE

1155
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
THING ONLY, WHICH IS

1156
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
RETRAUMATIZING US.

1157
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
DO YOU REMEMBER WITH 9/11 THERE

1158
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
WAS A CALL FOR THE MEDIA TO STOP

1159
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
SHOWING THE JETS FLYING INTO THE

1160
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
BUILDINGS, BECAUSE PSYCHOLOGISTS

1161
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
LIKE MYSELF AND OTHERS WERE

1162
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
SEEING OUR PATIENTS HAVING VIVID

1163
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
FLASHBACKS, NIGHTMARES,

1164
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER

1165
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
REACTION.

1166
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
EXCESSIVE COVERAGE OF THIS CAN

1167
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
BE TRAUMATIZING.

1168
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I'VE LOOKED AT PICTURES OF DEAD

1169
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
CHILDREN AND BABIES IN THE CASES

1170
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I'VE WORKED ON AND HAD

1171
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
NIGHTMARES.

1172
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
ONE CASE IN PARTICULAR I STILL

1173
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
HAVE FLASHBACKS TO JUST LOOKING

1174
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
AT PICTURES, BUT NO, IT DOESN'T

1175
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
CAUSE THIS KIND OF THING.

1176
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
CAN I SAY ONE THING REALLY,

1177
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
REALLY CLEARLY THAT I ONLY

1178
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
TOUCHED ON ON FRIDAY, YOUR

1179
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
CHANCES OF BEING SHOT AND KILLED

1180
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
IN A MASS SHOOTING LIKE THIS ARE

1181
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
ACTUALLY LESS THAN BEING STRUCK
BY LIGHTNING.

1182
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULDN'T

1183
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
COVER THIS AND TALK ABOUT THIS,

1184
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY, MORGAN

1185
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
FREEMAN, THIS IS NOT CAUSING --

1186
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
>> I'M HEARING APPARENTLY MORGAN

1187
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
FREEMAN HAS COME OUT AND SAID

1188
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
IT'S A HOAX, ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN

1189
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
RUNNING ALL OVER THE MEDIA FOR

1190
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
THE LAST 24 HOURS.

1191
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
IT MAY BE A HOAX, AS HE APPEARS

1192
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
TO NOW BE CLARIFYING.

1193
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
EITHER WAY, THOUGH, IT'S A

1194
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
DEBATE A LOT OF PEOPLE I'VE BEEN

1195
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
SEEING ON TWITTER, CNN ANCHORS,

1196
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
ANDERSON COOPER AND OTHERS THINK

1197
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
YOU SHOULDN'T BE NAMING.

1198
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE SHOULD BE

1199
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
THINKING ABOUT QUITE CAREFULLY.
>> IT IS A VALID THING TO BE

1200
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
THINKING ABOUT, BUT THEN YOU

1201
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
TURN TO THE RESEARCH, IF YOU

1202
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
HAVE VIABLE RESEARCH TO LOOK AT,

1203
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
YOU CAN LOOK AT EXPERTS WHO CAN

1204
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
ASSESS THE TRUTHFULNESS OF THE

1205
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
CONCLUSIONS.

1206
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
WE DON'T SEE THAT COVERAGE LIKE

1207
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
THIS CAUSES VIOLENCE.

1208
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
>> FINAL QUESTION, EVERYBODY

1209
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
WANTS TO KNOW THE SAME THING,

1210
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
WHY WOULD A 20-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO

1211
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
JUST SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE BIT

1212
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
OF A LONER, LITTLE BIT STRANGE,

1213
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
BUT NOTHING DANGEROUS AT ALL,

1214
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
WHY WOULD HE GO TO A SCHOOL AND

1215
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
KILL 20, 5, 6, 7-YEAR-OLD KIDS?

1216
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
>> THE PERSON THAT HAS THE

1217
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
ANSWER MAINLY IS ADAM.

1218
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
ONE THING WE KNOW IS PEOPLE WITH

1219
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
MENTAL ILLNESSES AND PEOPLE WHO

1220
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
DON'T HAVE MENTAL ILLNESSES WHO

1221
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
DO THESE THINGS ISOLATE

1222
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
THEMSELVES FIRST.

1223
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BUILD

1224
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
BRIDGES TO THESE PEOPLE.

1225
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I TELL YOU WHAT, THE PEOPLE WHO

1226
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
ARE VIOLENT AND ARE PRONE TO

1227
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
SUICIDE, IN MY FIELD, WE PREVENT

1228
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ALL THE

1229
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
TIME WHEN WE BUILD A

1230
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PERSON.

1231
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
THEY WILL TALK TO ME, YOU KNOW

1232
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
WHAT, DOC, I'M SO ANGRY I'M

1233
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
THINKING ABOUT KILLING MY
MOTHER.

1234
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
>> HIS COMPUTER HARD DRIVE THE

1235
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
FBI HAVE.

1236
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
>>> WHEN WE COME BACK, WHAT TO

1237
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
DO ABOUT GUNS.

1238
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
IT'S TRULY A QUESTION ABOUT LIFE

1239
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
AND DEATH AND FEELINGS ON BOTH

1240
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
SIDES ARE VERY MOTIVE.

1241
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I'LL TALK TO BOTH SIDES AFTER

1242
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
THE BREAK.

1243
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
>>> AND WE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE.

1244
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
SINCE I'VE BEEN PRESIDENT, THIS

1245
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
IS THE FOURTH TIME WE HAVE COME

1246
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
TOGETHER TO COMFORT A GRIEVING

1247
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
COMMUNITY TORN APART BY MASS

1248
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
SHOOTINGS.

1249
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
FOURTH TIME WE'VE HUGGED

1250
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
SURVIVORS, THE FOURTH TIME WE'VE

1251
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
CONSOLED THE FAMILIES OF
VICTIMS.

1252
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
AND IN BETWEEN, THERE HAVE BEEN

1253
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
AN ENDLESS SERIES OF DEADLY

1254
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
SHOOTINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

1255
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
ALMOST DAILY REPORTS OF VICTIMS,

1256
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
MANY OF THEM CHILDREN.

1257
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA IN TONIGHT'S

1258
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
VIGIL CALLING FOR CHANGE, BUT

1259
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
THE QUESTION REMAINS WHAT

1260
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
AMERICA SHOULD DO ABOUT GUNS.

1261
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
PRESIDENT OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN

1262
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE AND THE

1263
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
ATTORNEY FOR THE MICHIGAN

1264
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
COALITION FOR RESPONSIBLE GUN

1265
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
OWNERS.

1266
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I WANT YOUR REACTION, FIRST OF

1267
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
ALL, DAN GROSS, WHAT DO YOU MAKE

1268
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
OF HOW THE PRESIDENT SAID, AND

1269
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
HOW SERIOUS DO YOU THINK HE IS

1270
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
ABOUT ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING

1271
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
RATHER THAN JUST WORDS?

1272
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
>> WE'RE INSPIRED.
I MEAN, WE'RE INSPIRED TO TAKE

1273
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
HIM AT HIS WORD.

1274
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
THE PRESIDENT, SINCE THIS HAS

1275
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
HAPPENED, HAS CALLED FOR

1276
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
MEANINGFUL ACTION.

1277
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
HE'S SAYING ALL THE RIGHT

1278
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
THINGS, AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT

1279
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
ALL THE RIGHT THINGS.

1280
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
IT'S UP TO US, THE AMERICAN

1281
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
PUBLIC NOW, INCLUDING ALL THE

1282
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
VICTIMS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED

1283
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
BY THESE TRAGEDIES, TO MAKE SURE

1284
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
HE DOES TAKE THAT ACTION.

1285
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
THOSE ARE THE DOTS THAT NEED TO
BE CONNECTED.

1286
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
THIS IS THE TIME.

1287
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
CHANGE HAS TO HAPPEN.

1288
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
AND THIS REALLY IS A PIVOTAL

1289
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THIS

1290
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
ISSUE, AND YOU CAN JUST SENSE IT

1291
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
WATCHING THIS TONIGHT AND SEEING

1292
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
HOW THAT COMMUNITY IS GRIEVING

1293
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
AND KNOWING HOW OUR WHOLE NATION

1294
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
IS GRIEVING.

1295
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
WE DO THINK THIS IS A TIME FOR

1296
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
CHANGE AND WE DO THINK PRESIDENT

1297
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
OBAMA IS GOING TO LEAD US IN THE
RIGHT DIRECTION.

1298
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
>> STEVE, THE NATURE OF THIS

1299
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
DEBATE, I THINK, NEEDS TO BE

1300
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
CRYSTALLIZED AND CLARIFIED.

1301
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
TOO MANY PEOPLE ON EACH SIDES

1302
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
TAKE POSITIONS AND PUT WORDS IN

1303
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
THE MOUTH OF THEIR OPPONENTS.

1304
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
YOU THE REALITY IS THIS, NOBODY
