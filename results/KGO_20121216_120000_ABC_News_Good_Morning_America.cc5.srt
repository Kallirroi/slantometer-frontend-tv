LITTLE GIRL SURVIVED THE

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
THIS LITTLE GIRL'S MOTHER.

97
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
A HARROWING STORY OF HOW A FIRST

98
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
GRADER LIVED BY PLAYING DEAD.

99
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
>> YOU HAVE ONE PARISHIONER WHO

100
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
WAS RIGHT THERE, A LITTLE GIRL,

101
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A FIRST GRADER.

102
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
>> SHE WAS THE FIRST STUDENT WHO
RAN OUT OF THE SANDY HOOK

103
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
SCHOOL, 6 1/2 YEARS OLD.

104
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
SHE RAN OUT OF THE SCHOOL

105
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
BUILDING COVERED IN BLOOD FROM

106
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
HEAD TO TOE AND THE FIRST WORDS

107
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
SHE SAID TO HER MOM WHEN SHE GOT

108
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
OUTSIDE WAS, MOMMY, I'M OKAY,

109
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
BUT ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD.

110
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
SOMEHOW IN THAT MOMENT GOD'S

111
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
GRACE WAS ABLE TO ACT AS IF SHE

112
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
WAS ALREADY --

113
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
>> WAS SHE THE ONLY ONE IN THAT

114
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
CLASS THAT SURVIVED.

115
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
>> YI, OF THOSE WHO WERE LEFT IN

THE CLASSROOM OF FIRST GRADERS

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
SHE WAS THE LONE SURVIVOR.

118
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
>> WHAT HAS SHE TOLD HER MOM?

119
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
WHAT DID SHE SEE IN THERE.

120
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
>> WELL, SHE SAW SOMEONE WHO SHE

121
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
FELT WAS ANGRY AND SOMEBODY WHO

122
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
SHE FELT WAS VERY MAD.

123
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
>> HOW AT 6 1/2 YEARS OLD CAN

124
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
YOU BE THAT SMART, THAT BRAVE?

125
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
>> I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

126
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
OUTSIDE OF DIVINE INTERVENTION.

127
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
SHE HAS WISDOM BEYOND HER YEARS.

128
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
>> HOW ARE THE MOM AND DAD

129
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
DOING?

130
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
>> I THINK AS WELL AS YOU CAN

131
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
EXPECT THEM TO DO.

132
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
>> THEY MUST BE RELIEVED TO HAVE

133
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
THEIR CHILD BUT --

134
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
>> THE MOM TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS

135
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
SUFFERING FROM WHAT SHE CALLED

136
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
SURVIVOR'S GUILT BECAUSE SO MANY

137
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
OF THEIR FRIENDS NO LONGER HAVE

138
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
THEIR CHILDREN BUT SHE HAS HERS.

139
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
>> A LONG ROAD AHEAD.

140
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
AN INCREDIBLE STORY OF SURVIVAL

141
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
AND ALL BY A 6-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

142
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000

THANK YOU FOR THAT.

147
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
>> THE PLAN IS TO RE-OPEN THE

WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO GET

154
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
THINGS MOVING AGAIN.

155
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
>> WELL, ALL THE MENTAL HEALTH

EXPERTS WE TALKED TO AND THE

157
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
STATE HAS DONE A WONDERFUL JOB

158
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
OF BRINGING IN SOME HELP TELL US

159
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
IT'S THE BEST THING TO DO TO GET

160
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
BACK TO NORMAL OPERATIONS AS

161
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
SOON AS POSSIBLE.
BEST FOR THE CHILDREN AND FOR

162
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
THE STAFF AND FOR THE COMPLUPTS.

163
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
>> WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE

164
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
STUDENTS WHO ARE ENROLLED AT

165
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

166
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
>> WELL, THIS SCHOOL HERE, WE'RE

167
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
CLEARLY NOT GOING TO BE IN THIS

168
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
BUILDING ANY TIME IN THE

169
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
FORESEEABLE FUTURE BUT CLOSE TO

170
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
A PLAN TO MOVE THE COMMUNITY

171
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
TO -- THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY TO

172
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
ANOTHER LOCATION.
THOSE DETAILS WILL PROBABLY COME

173
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
OUT TODAY.
I'M NOT REALLY PREPARED TO

174
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
REALLY SAY BUT WE KNOW IT'LL

175
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
WORK.
>> DO YOU THINK YOU CAN EVER

176
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
RE-OPEN THIS SCHOOL AND WHAT
WOULD YOU SAY TO PARENTS WHO SAY

177
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I NEVER WANT TO SEND MY CHILD --

178
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
>> I WOULD PROBABLY FEEL VERY

179
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
MUCH THE SAME WAY.

180
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
MY THREE DAUGHTERS WENT TO THIS

181
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
SCHOOL AND WE HAVE MANY MEMORIES

182
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
THERE.
I THINK TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

183
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THAT

184
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
IS A LONG PROCESS AND, YOU KNOW,

185
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
WE'RE NOT ANYWHERE PREPARED TO

186
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
MAKE THOSE DECISIONS NOW.

371
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
BE WARNED OF THE DANGERS THAT

372
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
HAD INVADED THEIR SCHOOL.

373
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO FIND THE

374
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
RIGHT WORDS AFTER SEEING HOW

375
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
MUCH THIS COMMUNITY HAS LOST,

376
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
BUT SOMEHOW, SOME WAY THE FATHER

377
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
OF LITTLE EMILIE PARKER FOUND

378
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
THOSE WORDS WHEN HE SPOKE TO

379
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
CAMERAS OUTSIDE OF A NEWTOWN,
CONNECTICUT CHURCH.

380
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
>> AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

381
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

382
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

383
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

384
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
WAS AND HOW MANY LIVES THAT SHE

385
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
WAS ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT

386
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
TIME HERE ON EARTH.

387
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

388
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
VERY LOVING AS THOSE WERE THE

389
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
GIFTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY

390
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
HER HEAVENLY FATHER.

391
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
THE STRENGTH AND EXAMPLE SHE

392
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
SHOWED US WAS REMARKABLE.

393
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON.

394
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
AND I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER

395
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
DAD.

396
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET THROUGH

397
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

398
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
MY WIFE AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND

399
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
HOW TO PROCESS ALL OF THIS AND

400
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
HOW TO GET OUR LIVES GOING.

401
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'M NOT MAD BECAUSE I HAVE TO

402
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
MAKE SURE THAT I USE THIS EVENT

403
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
TO DO WHAT I CAN TO DO WHATEVER

404
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I CAN TO, ONE, MAKE SURE THAT MY

405
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
FAMILY AND MY WIFE AND MY

406
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
DAUGHTERS ARE TAKE KANE CARE OF

407
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO

408
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
TO HELP ANYBODY ANYWHERE, I'D BE

409
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
WILLING TO DO THAT.

410
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
>> WHAT AN INCREDIBLY STRONG AND

411
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
BRAVE AND COURAGEOUS MAN.

412
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
MY HAT IS CERTAINLY OFF TO HIM

413
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
AS A PARENT.

414
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I DON'T THINK THAT I COULD DO

415
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
THAT.
>> AND COVERING THIS STORY AS A

416
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
PARENT, I KNOW YOU'VE GOT THREE

417
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
LITTLE GIRLS, EXTRAORDINARILY

418
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
DIFFICULT.

SCHOOL IS CLOSED HERE IN

420
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT TOMORROW,

BE A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT

425
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
EXPERIENCE.
THERE IS A FEAR FACTOR AND THE

426
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
SENSE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW, THAT

427
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ISN'T SACRED

428
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
ANYMORE.

429
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
IT'S NOT A SAFE PLACE ANYMORE

430
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
THAT WE ONCE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

431
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
AND A LOT OF PARENTS WILL HUG

432
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
THEIR PARENTS MORE TIGHTER

433
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
BEFORE THEY SEND THEM OFF.

434
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000

AS A REGULAR FRIDAY MORNING

920
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
WOULD BE TO EVERYONE AND THEN IT

921
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
ALL JUST CHANGED.

922
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
>> HEARD SCREAMING.

923
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
>> WE WERE LIKE ALL SCARED.

924
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
>> WE HEARD A LOUD BANG.

925
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
WE THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING FELL

926
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
THEN WE HEARD ANOTHER AND THEN

927
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
WE SAW A GUN SHOT.

928
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
>> WE THOUGHT IT WAS A SAFETY

929
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
DRILL BUT THEN WE NOTICED IT WAS

930
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
REAL.
>> WE HID IN THE STORAGE ROOM

931
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
AND I ACTUALLY PRAYED TO GOD.

932
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
>> EVERYBODY WAS A LITTLE SCARED

933
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
CRYING AND I FELT ACTUALLY A

934
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
LITTLE SICK LIKE I WAS GOING TO

935
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
THROW UP.
>> IT FELT LIKE IT LASTED LIKE

936
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
AN HOUR BUT IT WAS REALLY LIKE

937
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
MAYBE 20 MINUTES.

938
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
>> WHEN I WENT TO THE FIRE

939
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
DEPARTMENT, WHEN I DIDN'T SEE

940
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
HIM, I WAS LIKE OH MY GOD WHAT

941
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER.
>> WHAT'S THE HARDEST PART?

942
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
>> THAT SOMEONE WOULD MURDER SO

943
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
MANY PEOPLE.
>> AND I FINALLY SAW ETHAN I WAS

944
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
VERY RELIEVED.
>> YOU SAID EARLIER YOU SAID YOU

945
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
THINK YOUR TEACHER SAVED YOUR

946
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
LIFE.
>> SHE SAVED ALL OF US.

947
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
THERE'S 19 PEOPLE IN OUR CLASS

948
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
AND SHE SAVED ALL OF US.

949
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
>> AND THE QUESTION FACING

950
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
PARENTS EVERYWHERE THIS MORNING

951
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
IS, OF COURSE, HOW DO I TALK TO

952
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
MY OWN CHILD ABOUT THESE

953
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
TERRIBLE EVENTS?

954
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN THE

955
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
UNEXPLAINABLE?
THE INEXPLAINABLE, DIFFICULT FOR

956
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
EVEN US TO COMPREHEND.

957
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
JOINING US IS JOURNALIST AND

>> NICE TO BE HERE WITH YOU ON

969
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
WHAT IS REALLY A TRAGIC MORNING

970
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
FOR ALL OF US, FOR ALL PARENTS.

971
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
>> WILLOW, I WANT TO START BY --

972
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
WELL, I WANT TO START BY ASKING

973
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
YOU THE QUESTION THAT WE'VE BEEN

974
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
TALKING ABOUT THIS MORNING, ALL

975
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
THREE OF US BEING PARENTS, HOW

976
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
DO WE APPROACH THIS TOPIC?

977
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I KNOW MY KIDS WERE ASKING ABOUT

978
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
IT LAST NIGHT, WHERE I WOULD BE

979
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
THIS MORNING.
HOW DO YOU DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S

980
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
COMPASSIONATE AND GIVING THEM

981
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED

982
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
BUT NOT TOO MUCH?

983
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
>> SO THE FIRST THING YOU WANT

984
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
TO DO IS ESTABLISH THAT THERE'S

985
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
NO QUESTION TOO SCARY FOR YOUR

986
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
CHILD TO TALK ABOUT, TO CREATE A

987
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
REALLY SAFE AND COMFORTABLE

988
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
PLACE FOR THEM TO COME AND TALK

989
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
TO YOU.

990
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
THE SECOND THING YOU WANT TO DO

991
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
IS SUPPRESS THE NORMAL PARENTAL

992
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
INSTINCT TO TELL THEM

993
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
EVERYTHING.

994
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
YOU WANT IT TO COME FROM YOU.

995
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
WAUGH WANT TO BE THE ONE TO TELL

996
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
THEM BUT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

997
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
SITUATIONS WHAT THEE NEED TO DO
AS WE DO AS JOURNALISTS AND ASK

998
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
OUR CHILDREN QUESTION SO WE GET

999
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
A BASELINE ON WHAT THEY'RE

1000
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
UNDERSTANDING.

1001
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
REMEMBER THEY'RE PROCESSING

1002
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
UNTHINKABLE INFORMATION AND
ADULT INFORMATION WITH THE MINDS

1003
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
OF CHILDREN.

1004
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
SO YOU WANT TO ASK THEM

1005
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
QUESTIONS LIKE, WELL, WHAT DO

1006
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

1007
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT?

1008
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
ARE THE KIDS AT SCHOOL TALKING

1009
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
ABOUT THAT JUST AS A WAY OF

1010
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
GETTING THE CONVERSATION STARTED

1011
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
AND I'M GETTING A MORE PRECISE

1012
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT EXACTLY

1013
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
THEY KNOW AND THEY THINK TO BE

1014
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
THE TRUTH.

1015
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
>> AND, WILLOW, ONE OF THE

1016
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
QUESTIONS I RECEIVED FROM MY

1017
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
10-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, ONE OF THE

1018
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
FIRST QUESTIONS OUT OF HER MOUTH

1019
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
WAS WHY MOMMY.

1020
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
WHY WOULD SOMEONE DO LIKE THIS

1021
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I DIDN'T HAVE

1022
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
AN ANSWER FOR HER.

1023
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
WHAT DO YOU TELL YOUR CHILDREN,

1024
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
WILLOW, WHEN THEY ASK WHY?

1025
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
>> BY THE WAY, MY 14-YEAR-OLD --

1026
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING HE SAID

1027
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
TO ME, HOW -- WHY WOULD SOMEBODY

1028
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
DO THIS AND I THINK IN THAT

1029
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
SITUATION IT'S FINE TO ANSWER

1030
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
TRUTHFULLY, WHICH IS I DON'T

1031
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
KNOW.
I THINK EVERYBODY IS ASKING THAT

1032
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
QUESTION TODAY.

1033
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
BUT THEN WITH A YOUNG CHILD

1034
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
PARTICULARLY WITH A YOUNG CHILD

1035
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
BECAUSE THE YOUNG CHILDREN THINK

1036
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
VERY CONCRETELY.

1037
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
THEY DON'T -- THEY HAVEN'T

1038
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
MASTERED ABSTRACT THINKING.

1039
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
ASK THEM, WELL, WHY DO YOU

1040
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
THINK, WHY DO YOU THINK SOMEBODY

1041
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
WOULD HAVE MADE A CHOICE LIKE

1042
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
THAT AND IT'LL GET THEM

1043
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
PROCESSING SOME OF THIS

1044
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
INFORMATION IN THEIR OWN WAY.

1045
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
AND THEN YOU CAN STEER THE

1046
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
CONVERSATION TO WAYS PEOPLE

1047
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
COULD MAKE BETTER CHOICES, FOR

1048
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
EXAMPLE.
>> OKAY.

1049
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

1050
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
THINGS IS, OF COURSE, TO MAKE

1051
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
THEM FEEL SAFE.

1052
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
YOU HEARD A LITTLE GIRL I SPOKE

1053
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
TO LAST NATE SAID SHE'S AFRAID

1054
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

1055
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
CHILDREN EVERYWHERE WILL

1056
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
EXPERIENCE SOME OF THESE

1057
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
FEELINGS OF ANXIETY.

1058
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
WHAT DO WE SAY TO THEM ABOUT

1059
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
FEELING SAFE AND KNOWING THAT

1060
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
THEY ARE SAFE?

1061
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
>> WELL, AGAIN, CHILDREN, YOUNG

1062
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR THINK

1063
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
VERY CONCRETELY SO IT'S VERY

1064
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
HELPFUL TO REASSURE THEM IN VERY

1065
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
CONCRETE AND SPECIFIC WAYS THAT

1066
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
THEY WILL BE SAFE WHEN THEY GO

1067
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
TO SCHOOL.

1068
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
SO YOU REMIND THEM THAT THERE

1069
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
ARE ADULTS OUT THERE WHOSE JOB

1070
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
IT IS TO KEEP THEM SAFE, WHETHER

1071
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
IT'S POLICEMEN.

1072
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
THEIR SCHOOL PRINCIPAL.

1073
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
THEIR TEACHERS.

1074
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
AND WALK THEM THROUGH THE SAFETY

1075
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
MEASURES IN THEIR SCHOOL.

1076
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
THERE'S SOMEBODY STANDING AT THE

1077
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
FRONT GATE.
THERE ARE DRILLS THAT WE DO,

1078
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
PRACTICE YOUR DRILLS.

1079
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
AGAIN, VERY CONCRETE AND

1080
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
SPECIFIC THINGS THAT ARE GOING

1081
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
ON IN THEIR SCHOOL TO KEEP THEM

1082
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
SAFE.

1083
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
ALSO, ASK THEM FOR THEIR OWN

1084
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
IDEAS.

1085
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN DO TO

1086
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
HELP KEEP YOU SAFER?

1087
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HELP YOU

1088
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
FEEL SAFER?

1089
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
OFTENTIMES ALLOWING THEM TO

1090
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
PARTICIPATE WILL REALLY HELP

1091
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
THEM FEEL BETTER, BUT THEN

1092
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
ALWAYS COME BACK TO REMINDING

1093
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
THEM THAT IT'S THE JOB OF ADULTS

1094
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF US, HARD

1095
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
AT WORK, TO KEEP THEM SAFE.

1096
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
>> WILLOW BAY, FANTASTIC ADVICE

1097
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
AND ADVICE THAT EACH AND EVERY

1098
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
ONE OF US AS PARENTS AROUND THIS

1099
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
ENTIRE COUNT CAN USE AS OUR

1100
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000

A deep, throbbing,
persistent ache.

1251
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
My doctor diagnosed it
as fibromyalgia,

1252
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
thought to be the
result of overactive nerves

1253
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
that cause chronic
widespread pain.

1254
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Lyrica is believed
to calm these nerves.

1255
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000

significant relief

1257
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And for some people,
it can work in as early as

1258
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
the first week of treatment.

00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
So now I can do more of
the things that I enjoy.

1260
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Lyrica is not for everyone.

1261
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Lyrica may cause serious
allergic reactions

1262
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
or suicidal thoughts or actions.

1263
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Tell your doctor right away
if you have these,

1264
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
new or worsening depression,

1265
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000

or behavior,

affected breathing or skin,

or changes in eyesight,
including blurry vision

1268

or muscle pain with fever
or tired feeling.

1269
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Common side effects
are dizziness, sleepiness,

1270
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
weight gain, and swelling of
hands, legs and feet.

1271
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Don't drink alcohol
while taking Lyrica.

1272
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Don't drive or use machinery
until you know

1273
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
how Lyrica affects you.

I'm feeling better

if Lyrica is right
