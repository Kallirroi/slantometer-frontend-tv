00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
ATTENDS A.A. MEETINGS
AT A CHURCH ON FLORIDA AVENUE.

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
IT'S WHERE WE MET.
SHE'S AN ALCOHOLIC?

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
COCAINE.
YOU'RE AN ALCOHOLIC?

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I HAVE AN ADDICTION,
BUT NOT TO DRUGS OR ALCOHOL.

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
(Olivia) WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HER?

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
THURSDAY MORNING.

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
YOU'VE KNOWN HER FOR HOW LONG?
THREE MONTHS.

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
HUCK, I KNOW YOU LOVE THIS GIRL,
BUT I HAVE TO ASK--

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
IS THERE ANY CHANCE SHE WAS
INVOLVED IN SETTING YOU UP?

186
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
NO.

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'M TRAINED TO DETECT LYING,
AND ALL THAT ASIDE, I KNOW HER.

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I KNOW SHE WOULD
NEVER DO THAT TO ME.

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
NEVER. SHE'S IN TROUBLE.
SOMEONE GRABBED HER

190
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
TO LURE HER TO THAT HOTEL.
THEY KNEW I WOULD COME FOR HER.

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
SOMEONE HAS HER.

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
SOMEONE PROFESSIONAL
WHO KILLS FOR A LIVING,

193
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
WHO'S GOOD ENOUGH TO DO IT
WITH A REMOTE SNIPER RIFLE.

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
SOMEONE LIKE YOU?
THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN, RIGHT?

195
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.
QUINN.

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I NEED TO FIND BECKY BEFORE
THEY DECIDE SHE'S DISPOSABLE.

197
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
AND...

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
SHE'S A NICE PERSON.

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I NEED TO FIND HER.
OKAY. SO WE FIND HER,

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
CONNECT THE DOTS,
FIND OUT WHO SHE TALKED TO,

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
WHERE SHE WENT.
I'M GOING, TOO.

202
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
NO. YOU STAY HERE.
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL.

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
YOU'RE THE MOST WANTED MAN
IN AMERICA.

204
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
THE FBI HAS SKETCHES OF YOU
EVERYWHERE. YOU STAY HERE.

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
YOU DO NOT MOVE.
YOU DO NOT LEAVE THIS OFFICE.

206
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
HUCK, LOOK AT ME.

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
LOOK AT ME.

208
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
DO NOT LEAVE THIS OFFICE.

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
THE FBI SKETCH IS BASED
ON ONE INDIVIDUAL'S DESCRIPTION

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
ON WHAT IS BEING DESCRIBED
THUS FAR

211
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
AS A PERSON OF INTEREST
IN THE EVENTS SURROUNDING

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
THE SHOOTING OF PRESIDENT GRANT
AND BRITTA KAGEN.

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
FOR FURTHER DETAILS
ON THE INVESTIGATION,

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'D LIKE TO TURN THE PODIUM OVER

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
AND HER TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS.

216
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
(camera shutters clicking)

217
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
DAVID.

218
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
THE SKETCH IS THE RESULT
OF AN EYEWITNESS

219
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
WHO SAW THE SUSPECT
WITH A RED HOODIE

220
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
PULL THE FIRE ALARM
ON THE EIGHTH FLOOR.

221
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
WE ARE GOING THROUGH
HOTEL SECURITY FOOTAGE NOW

222
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
TO LOOK FOR LEADS.

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IS
BEING USED

224
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
TO SEEK A MATCH
WITH EVERY RECORD AVAILABLE.

225
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'M LEAVING
THE CABINET BRIEFINGS

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
AND THE WHITE HOUSE SCHEDULE
ON YOUR DESK.

227
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
ALSO THE MINUTES FROM
YESTERDAY'S N.S.A. MEETINGS.

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I FIGURE I WOULD PATCH YOU

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
INTO THE WHITE HOUSE
FOR ANY INTEL UPDATES.
DON'T BOTHER.

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
JUST BECAUSE
PRESIDENT LANGSTON--I'M SORRY.

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
JUST BECAUSE THAT WOMAN
KICKED YOU OUT OF YOUR OFFICE,

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T MOVE

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
TO ANOTHER OFFICE
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

234
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I HAVE ANOTHER OFFICE, MARY.
YOU'RE STANDING IN IT.

235
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
AND I'M NOT LEAVING HERE
UNTIL PRESIDENT GRANT--

236
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
THE ONLY PRESIDENT
OF THIS GREAT NATION--

237
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
LEAVES HIS HOSPITAL BED.

238
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
(telephone ringing)
(woman) ...THAT THE SHOOTER
MOST LIKELY HAS...

239
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
ARE YOU GETTING THAT?
NO.

240
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
MARY.
THAT'S YOUR HOME PHONE.
I DON'T ANSWER YOUR HOME PHONE.

241
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
BECAUSE UNLIKE YOU,
I STILL WORK AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

242
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
(door opens)
(ring)

243
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
OKAY. (mutters)

244
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
(ring)

245
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
HELLO?

246
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
MRS. NOVAK?

247
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
NO. I'M NOT AT WORK.

248
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
(coughs)

249
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
YES, I... (sighs)

250
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
YES, I KNOW
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON,

251
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
YOU WOULD THINK THEY NEED ME,
BUT THEY DON'T.

252
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
SO I HAVE TIME TO TALK TO
MY VERY FAVORITE MOTHER-IN-LAW.

253
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
YES, I HOPE THE PRESIDENT
PULLS THROUGH, TOO.

254
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
NO. JAMES ISN'T HERE RIGHT NOW.
HE'S AT WORK.

255
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
YEAH. THEY NEED HIM AT WORK.

256
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
DID YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE HIM A MESSAGE?

257
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
HIS NEXT VISIT? I DON'T KNOW.
PROBABLY NOT FOR A WHILE.

258
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
BECAUSE HE WAS JUST UP THERE
LAST WEEKEND.

259
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
JAMES DID NOT COME AND VISIT YOU
AND HIS DAD THIS PAST WEEKEND?

260
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
NO.

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I GUESS THAT'S MY MISTAKE.

262
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
YES.

263
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'LL HAVE HIM CALL AS SOON
AS HE GETS BACK HOME.

264
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'M STANDING IN YOUR CUBICLE.
WHERE ARE YOU?

265
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
OH, MY DAD'S HAVING
ONE OF THOSE DAYS

266
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
WHERE HE THINKS
I'M HIS UNCLE KRYSTOF.

267
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
ANYTHING I CAN DO?

268
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
NO. IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU,
THOUGH,

269
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I THINK I'LL SPEND
THE NIGHT HERE.

270
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
NO. NO. OF COURSE.

271
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
YEAH. WHATEVER YOU NEED.

272
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
THANKS.

273
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
BYE.

274
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
(beep)

275
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
JAMES.

276
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
DAVID, HEY.

277
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
YOU TOLD ME LAST NIGHT YOU FOUND
SOMETHING IN OHIO, BUT YOU

279
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
DIDN'T SAY WHAT IT WAS, AND NOW
YOU'RE NOT RETURNING MY CALLS.

280
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
IS IT SOMETHING ABOUT CYTRON?
LOOK, I-I REALLY CAN'T TALK
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

281
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
WHY?

282
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
BECAUSE IT'S COMPLICATED,

283
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
ESPECIALLY--
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THIS.

284
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT?

285
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I KNOW THAT IT SOUNDS VAGUE,
BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO TRUST ME.

286
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
FINE. BUT IF IT HAS
ANYTHING TO DO

287
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
WITH THE PRESIDENT GETTING SHOT,
ANYTHING AT ALL--

288
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW.

289
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
MADAM PRESIDENT,
I AM HUMBLED

290
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
AND TRULY HONORED
TO STAND BEFORE

291
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
THE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT
OF THESE UNITED STATES.

292
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
VERY KIND.

293
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
MA'AM, I'M NOT ONE TO
SPEAK OUT OF SCHOOL, BUT--

294
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
OH, WELL, HELL--
EXCUSE MY FRENCH.

295
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
WE BOTH KNOW IF I'M BREATHING,
I'M SPEAKING OUT OF SCHOOL,

296
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
BUT IT'S MY PURE BELIEF

297
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR PROPER DUE
AS V.P.

298
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
THERE. SAID.

299
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
WELL, MY POSITION HAS HAD
ITS, UH, CHALLENGES.

300
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
NOW CAN WE GET
TO YOUR BUSINESS, HOLLIS?

301
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
WHATEVER STRETCH
THE ALMIGHTY HAS IN MIND

302
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
FOR YOU TO NOW LEAD
THIS GREAT LAND--

303
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
BE IT A WEEK, A MONTH,
OR LONGER--

304
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
YOU WERE PUT HERE
FOR A PURPOSE,

305
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
SURE AS HE MADE THE WORLD.

306
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
AND THAT PURPOSE IS TO MAKE
YOURSELF SOME HISTORY.

307
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
THAT IS,
IF YOU'RE SO INCLINED.

308
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
MIGHT BE TIME TO PAY A VISIT
TO VERNA THORNTON.

309
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

310
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
NOTHING KNOCKED OVER
OR EVEN ASKEW.

311
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
IF BECKY WAS ABDUCTED,
IT WASN'T FROM HERE.

312
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
STILL HOLDING?

313
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
THE PRESIDENT WAS SHOT. THEY'RE
A LITTLE BUSY AT JUSTICE.

314
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
BUT DON'T WORRY. MY GUY'S SOLID.
OWES ME BIG-TIME.

315
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
YEAH, JIM. LISTEN, THAT SECURITY
FOOTAGE AT THE STANWORTH HOTEL

316
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
BEFORE AND AFTER THE SHOOTING--
I'M GONNA NEED A COPY.

317
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL IN
THAT FAVOR.

318
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
DUDE, I MADE THAT D.U.I.
GO AWAY. I SAVED YOU 12 GRAND.

319
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
NO, THIS IS EXACTLY
THE KIND OF THING

320
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
PEOPLE MEAN WHEN THEY SAY,
"I OWE YOU."

321
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
WAIT. WAIT.

322
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
(beep)
HE HUNG UP.

323
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
WOW. MR. BIG TIME.

324
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
THEY'RE ON LOCKDOWN.

325
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
THEY'RE NOT RELEASING ANYTHING
TO ANYONE FOR ANY REASON.

326
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I MAY HAVE SOMEONE
I CAN CALL.

327
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
(keyboard keys clicking)

328
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
ANY LUCK WITH
THE HOTEL SECURITY FEED?

329
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
UH, THE FBI PULLED IT. I'M
SEEING IF THEY HAVE IT CACHED.

330
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
(sighs) SO I GUESS
WE'RE BOTH PATSIES THEN.

331
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
ME FOR THE CYTRON EXPLOSION,
YOU FOR SHOOTING THE PRESIDENT.

332
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
MAKES YOU WONDER
IF THEY'RE RELATED.

333
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN, WHOEVER SET ME UP
FOR THE CYTRON EXPLOSION

334
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
MUST'VE BEEN PRETTY UNHAPPY
I SLIPPED THROUGH THEIR FINGERS.

335
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
IF THEY KNEW YOU WERE THE GUY
WHO TOOK ME,

336
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
FIRST OF ALL, THEY'D BE PISSED,
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

337
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
IF THEY DID THEIR HOMEWORK,
THEY'D KNOW YOU WERE EX-CIA,

338
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
AND WHO BETTER TO PIN
AN ASSASSINATION ON

339
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
THAN SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN TOSSED
ASIDE BY THE GOVERNMENT?

340
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
SO WHO WERE THEY, HUCK?
WHO SET ME UP?

341
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW
BECAUSE YOU NEVER ASKED

342
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000

AT HIS HOUSE THE OTHER DAY.

514
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
AND WE NEVER HAD A CHANCE
TO TALK ABOUT IT,

515
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
BECAUSE, WELL,
ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE

516
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
WITH FITZ AND THE SHOOTING,

517
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
SO I WAS WONDERING, HOW IS
YOUR FATHER DOING? BETTER?

518
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
WORSE?

519
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
OH, ABOUT THE SAME, I GUESS.

520
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
THIS COULD REALLY USE
SOME MUSTARD. YOU WANT?

521
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
NO, I'M GOOD.

522
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
THERE. THAT'S HIM.

523
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
SAME RED SWEATSHIRT AS THE MAN
SEEN PULLING THE FIRE ALARM.

524
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
AND HE'S HEADING UP
TO THE EIGHTH FLOOR,

525
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
WHICH IS WHERE THE SHOTS
WERE FIRED FROM.

526
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
BUT NO CLEAR ANGLE
ON HIS FACE?
NO CLEAR ANGLE ON HIS FACE,

527
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
AND THE CAMERAS ON THE EIGHTH
FLOOR WERE TAMPERED WITH,

528
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY FOOTAGE OF
HIM FROM THERE. HOWEVER, MA'AM,

529
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
IF YOU'LL FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION
BACK ON THE MONITOR...

530
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
THERE. SEE? HE PICKS UP
THAT WOMAN'S CELL PHONE.

531
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
AND PRESUMABLY LEFT
HIS FINGERPRINTS ON IT.

532
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
HAVE YOU LOCATED
THE WOMAN YET?

533
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
WE'RE LOOKING FOR HER NOW.

534
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
HUCK'S FINGERPRINTS--

535
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
FIND OUT IF THEY'RE
IN ANY GOVERNMENT DATABASES.

536
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
OKAY, BUT FIRST--
The FBI has

537
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
SECURITY FOOTAGE OF HUCK
PICKING UP SOMEONE'S PHONE

538
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
IN THE HOTEL ELEVATOR.

539
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
OKAY, BUT--
If they find the phone,
they'll have

540
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
HIS PRINTS,
SO WE NEED TO KNOW

541
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
IF THEY'LL BE ABLE
TO MATCH THEM.

542
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
If that's the case, we track
down this woman and take

543
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
HER PHONE BEFORE THE FBI
CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON IT.

544
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
LIV, HUCK'S GONE.

545
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
WHAT?

546
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000

(girls laugh)

548
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
SUNDAYS IS PASTA
AND MONDAYS IS SANDWICHES,

549
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
BUT TONIGHT--
TONIGHT'S MY FAVORITE NIGHT.

550
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
THEY EAT PIZZA
AND THEY PLAY GAMES.

551
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
THAT'S THE BEST PART.
IT'S GAME NIGHT.

552
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
SHE'S CAROL, 34,

553
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
NOT A NATURAL BLONDE,
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

554
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
SHE TEACHES MATH
AT THE JUNIOR HIGH.

555
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
AND HE'S BILLY.
HE SELLS SPORTING GOODS,

556
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
WHICH IS AN ACTUAL THING--
SPORTING GOODS.

557
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000

558
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
AND THE LITTLE GIRLS
ARE LUCY--SHE'S 8,

559
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
AND SARAH BETH--SHE'S 10.

560
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU?

561
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000

THAT BIBLE-THUMPING BITCH IS
BLACKMAILING ME,

692
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
AND I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE IN TO HER. I WON'T.

693
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
BUT I HAVE EVERY INTENTION
OF LIVING LONG ENOUGH TO RESIGN

694

PRESIDENT IN OFFICE.

FITZ IS A LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

696
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I'M TALKING ABOUT--
HE'S LYING IN A HOSPITAL ROOM,
FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE,

697
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
AND HE HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH HOW HE GOT ELECTED.

698
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
HE'S A PATRIOT
AND HE'S LEGITIMATE.

699
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
WE'RE BOTH IN HOSPITAL ROOMS.

ANYTHING I CAN DO TO KEEP HER
FROM BLACKMAILING ME?

704
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
YOU CAN RESIGN.

00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
YOU BOUGHT A BABY?
I PULLED SOME STRINGS

858
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
AND GOT US
TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE,

859
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
WHICH IS WRONG, VERY WRONG.

860
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
BUT LIKE I SAID,
I'M A REPUBLICAN OVERLORD,

861
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
AND YOUR DREAM IS A BABY,
SO...

(chuckles)

863
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
AND NOW YOU'RE THINKING
"WHY NOW?"

864
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
WHEN I DIDN'T WANT A BABY
BEFORE, WHY NOW?

865
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
SOMEONE SH--

866
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
SHOT MY BEST FRIEND.

867
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
HE'S LYING IN A HOSPITAL BED
DYING,

868
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
WHICH MAKES ME DENYING US

869
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
A CHANCE TO START A FAMILY
SEEM LUDICROUS.

870
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
SO THERE'S A BABY GIRL
IN COUNTY GENERAL,

871
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
AND IF YOU SAY YES, IN ONE WEEK,
SHE COULD BE OUR DAUGHTER.

872
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000

YES.

I'LL GO BACK TO WORK SOON.

874
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000

WHICH MEANS

876
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000

YES.

877
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
YOU'LL HAVE TO QUIT YOUR JOB

878
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000

SHOULD BE AT HOME.

1033
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
MADAM PRESIDENT, SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE VERNA THORNTON

1034
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
IS HERE TO SEE YOU.

1035
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.
YES, I AM.

1036
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
ARE YOU HERE TO DELIVER
YOUR LETTER OF RESIGNATION?

1037
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I DO HAVE IT, HOWEVER...
HOWEVER?

1038
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER
YOU SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD.

1039
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I'M NOT SURE THERE IS
ANYTHING I WANT FROM YOU,

1040
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
OTHER THAN YOUR SEAT
ON THE BENCH, SO--

1041
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
NOT EVEN THE NAME
OF THE MAN IN THE RED HOODIE?

1042
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I COULD GIVE YOU
MY LETTER OF RESIGNATION

1043
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
OR I COULD GIVE YOU THE NAME

1044
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
OF THE MAN WHO TRIED TO KILL
THE PRESIDENT.

1045
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
THE MOST WANTED MAN
IN THE WORLD,

1046
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
YOUR OSAMA bin LADEN.

1047
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
ONE PILL MAKES YOU LARGER.

1048
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
ONE PILL MAKES YOU SMALL.

1049
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
YOU NEED TO COME HERE.
HUCK NEEDS YOU.

1050
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
HE KEEPS SAYING THAT SHE KILLED
HIS FAMILY.

1051
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Do you know what that means?

1052
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
What family?

1053
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
HUCK, YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO ME
RIGHT NOW.

1054
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
SHE WILL NOT GET AWAY WITH THIS.
WE WILL FIND HER.

1055
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,000
WE WILL FIND HER.

1056
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE NOT
TELLING THE FBI ABOUT BECKY.

1057
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
WON'T DO ANY GOOD.
SHE'S IN THE WIND.

1058
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
SO? THEY COULD MOBILIZE

1059
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
THOUSANDS OF AGENTS
TO LOOK FOR HER.

1060
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
THEY COULD GET THE WHOLE COUNTRY
LOOKING FOR HER.

1061
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
IT TOOK THE WHOLE COUNTRY
TWO YEARS TO FIND YOU,

1062
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
AND YOU WEREN'T EVEN
A SUPERSPY.

1063
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
ALSO, IF THEY START
LOOKING INTO BECKY,

1064
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
THEY'LL EVENTUALLY FIND
A HUCK CONNECTION.

1065
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
THE FBI ONLY HAS
A PARTIAL PRINT.

1066
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
AS LONG AS THEY CAN'T MATCH IT
TO HIM, HE'S SAFE.

1067
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I CAN'T WATCH THIS.

1068

00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000

1070
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
