TENT.

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
THAT VIOLENCE WAS SPARKED BY THE

37
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
PASSAGE OF THE RIGHT-TO-WORK

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
THE TENT BELONGING TO AMERICANS

42
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
FOR PROSPERITY.

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
BUT FIRST, CAUGHT UNDER THAT

48
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
TENT, AS IT WAS COMING DOWN,

49
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
VENDOR CLINT TARVER, THE HOTDOG

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
MORNING.

56
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
TAKE IT FROM THERE.

57
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
>> AT 10:00 IN THE MORNING, I

58
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
SET UP TO SELL HOTDOGS.

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
AT 10:30, I WAS READY TO SELL

60
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
HOTDOGS.
EVERYONE HAD TO HAVE A TICKET TO

61
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
RECEIVE A HOTDOG.

62
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
SO -- I GUESS ABOUT 11:30, MAYBE

63
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
A QUARTER TO 12, TWO GUYS CAME

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
INTO THE TENT.

65
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
AND ONE WAS WEARING THE MASK

66
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
LOOKS LIKE A DEVIL'S MASK.

67
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
THE OTHER ONE WAS WEARING A SKI

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
PLAIVEG.
AND SO, YOU KNOW -- SKI MASK.

69
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THEY WERE

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
HAVING SOME FUN.

71
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
JUST FUN.

72
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
SO THE GUY TOOK THEIR MAIVES

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
OFF.

74
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
THEY HAD A TICKET.
I GAVE NEM A HOTDOG.

75
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
AS SOON AS THEY GOT THROUGH

76
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
EATING THE HOTDOG, 3 MINUTES

77
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
LATER, THEY STARTED TO TEAR --

78
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
TURNING OVER THE COFFEE POTS,

79
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
URNS, ABOUT FOUR OF THEM.

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
THE TABLE GOT TURNED OVER AND BY

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
THAT TIME, THEY STARTED CUTTING

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
THE TENT.

83
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
COMING IN AND ONE OF THE

84
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
GROUNDSKEEPERS CAME IN AND SAID,

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
CLINT, HAVE YOU TO GET OUT OF

86
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
HERE.

87
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
THEY ARE CUTTING THE TENT.

88
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
THE TENT IS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE.

89
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
AT THAT TIME, I WAS TRYING TO

90
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
SAVE SOME OF MY STUFF, BUT I

91
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
COULDN'T.
BY THAT TIME, IT HAD COLLAPSED

92
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
AND I HAD TO CRAWL FROM UNDER

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
THE TENT TO GET AWAY.

94
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
AND SO, I CLIMBED OUT AND I WAS

95
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
JUST STANDING THERE AND AS I WAS

96
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
STANDING THERE.

97
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
THEY FORMED A LINE... AND THEY

98
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
WALKED ACROSS THE TENT, STOMPING

99
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THEIR

100
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
PATH.
TURNING OVER MY TABLES.

101
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000

102
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
HOTDOGS, MY CHILI, MY CHEESE, MY

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
SAUERKRAUT, EVERYTHING.

104
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
MY POP.

105
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
THEY THREW MY POP AROUND.

106
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
THEY HOLLERED RACIAL SLUR, THE

107
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
"N" WORD.

108
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I WAS AN UNCLE TOM.

109
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I HAD NO BUSINESS ON THIS SIDE.

110
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
BUT I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO

111
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
THEM THAT I AM A HOTDOG VENDOR.

112
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I WAS HIRED BY THESE PEOPLE TO

113
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
COME IN AND SELL HOTDOGS TO

114
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
PEOPLE WHO THIS TICKS.

115
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

116
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR 16

117
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
YEARS, GRETA.

118
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THERE FOR.

119
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I GOT CAUGHT UP IN THAT.

120
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
>> GRETA: WERE YOU EVER ABLE TO

121
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
SEE THEIR FACES.

122
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
OR WERE THEY AT ALL TIME IT'S.

123
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
>> NO!

124
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THEY TOOK THEIR MASKS OFF AND I

125
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
GAVE THEM A HOTDOG.

126
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
ONE WAS A RATHER THIN FELLA.

127
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THE OTHER ONE, I CAN'T REMEMBER

128
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
HIS FACE.

129
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I JUST THE OTHER GUY WAS A THIN

130
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
GUY.

131
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
YOUNG GUY.
>> GRETA: OTHER THAN THE VERY

132
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
OFFENSIVE RACIAL SLURS, DID THEY

133
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT RIGHT TO WORK

134
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
OR TO INDICATE WHAT SIDE OF THE

135
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
FIGHT THEY WERE ON, THIS BATTLE

136
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
OR WHETHER THEY WERE OUTSIDE

137
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
AGITATORS?
>> NO, THE PEOPLE WHO WERE

138
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
PROTESTING AGAINST THE

139
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
RIGHT-TO-WORK PEOPLE.

140
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
THEY WERE SO ANGRY AT THESE

141
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
PEOPLE.

142
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
AND THAT -- I GUESS THEY THOUGHT

143
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I WAS PART OF IT AND THEY

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000

145
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
WORD.
THEY EVEN SPIT ON A OF

146
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
PEOPLE.

147
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
THEY WERE OUT OF ORDER, GRETA.

148
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
TOTALLY.
>> GRETA: DID OTHERS JOIN IN OR

149
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
DID ANY OF THE SORT OF

150
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
PROTESTERS TRY TO STOP THEM OR

151
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
DID EVERYBODY STAND BY WHILE YOU

152
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
GOT TERRORIZED AND POSSIBLY VERY

153
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
HURTED WITH THE TENT?

154
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
>> NO.

155
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE THAT WAS

156
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
SAFETY.
THEY HAD SAFETY THINGS ON, SO

157
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
THEY WERE TRYING TO CALM THE

158
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
CROWD DOWN.

159
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000

185
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
IT WAS -- COFFEE ON IT.

186
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
IT WAS SCARY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE

187
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
FELT ACHERY, THEY FELT LIKE

188
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
THEIR PERSONAL SPACE HAD BEEN

189
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
INVADED AND THEIR RIGHT TO HAVE

190
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
THEIR VOICE HEARD WAS BEING

191
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
TRAMPLED ON.

192
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
>> GRETA: FOR YOU, DAVID, WHAT

193
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
WAS IT LIKE?

194
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
>> GOOD EVENING, GRETA.

195
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
IT WAS PRETTY INTENSE -- WE HAD

196
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
TO POST PEOPLE OUT BY THE STRAPS

197
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
TO KEEP THEM FROM UNDOING THEM

198
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
TO MAKE THE TENT CAVE IN.

199
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
WHEN THE COFFEE URNS WERE THROWN

200
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
OVER AND THE TABLES, WE KNEW

201
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
THEY WERE INSIDE.

202
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
WE CAME BACK AROUND AND WENT

203
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
INTO THE TENT.

204
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
IT WAS ALMOST COLLAPSED BY THEN.

205
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
>> GRETA: WHAT ARE THE POLICE

206
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
DOING ABOUT ALL OF THIS?

207
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
MICHIGAN STATE POLICE INSPECTOR

208
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
IS HERE.
GOOD EVENING.

209
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
>> GOOD EVENING, GRETA.

210
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
>> GRETA: WERE YOU OUTSIDE ON
THE GROUNDS YESTERDAY WHEN THIS

211
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WENT DOWN?

212
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
>> I WAS ALL OVER THE CAPITOL,

213
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
GRETA.
BUT WHEN THIS HAPPENED... WE HAD

214
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
PLATOONS SURROUNDING THE

215
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
BUILDING, KEEPING TRACK OF THE

216
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
CROWD.
WE DO KNOW WHERE THE TENTS WERE.

217
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
HOWEVER, HAVING A GROUND VIEW

218
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
AND THE TENTS BEING ABOUT 40

219
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
DEEP INTO THE CROWD, WE WERE

220
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
UNABLE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON.

221
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
HOWEVER, WHEN OUR HELICOPTER

222
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
REPORTED THAT IT LOOKED LIKE THE

223
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
TWO CANOPIES HAD COLLAPSED, WE

224
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
SENT TWO PLATOONS OF TROOPERS

225
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY

226
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
WAS INJURED OR TRAPPED UNDER THE

227
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
TENTS.

228
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
BY THE TIME OUR TROOPERS WORKED

229
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CROWDS,

230
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
THE PEOPLE WERE OUT OF THE

231
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
TENTS.

232
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
>> GRETA: NOW, I TAKE IT NO

233
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
ARRESTS WERE MADE ON THE SCENE,

234
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
THAT YOU DIDN'T GET THE PLATOONS

235
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
OR SINGLE POLICE OFFICERS OVER

236
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
TO THE AREA TO MAKE THE ARREST

237
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
FOR THESE TWO WHO HAD STARTED

238
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THIS DESTRUCTION?

239
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
>> NO, MA'AM.

240
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
A CROWD OF THIS SIZE, THIS SIZE

241
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
KIND OF A MOB-LIKE GROUP AT THAT

242
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
TIME, IS VERY FLUID.

243
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
WE HAD OUR HANDS FULL,

244
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
MAINTAINING THE CONTROL OF THE

245
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
CROWD.
BUT WHEN OUR TWO PLATOONS OF

246
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
TROOPERS WERE THERE, NOBODY

247
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
REPORTED ANY INJURIES NOR DID

248
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
ANYBODY REPORT ANY DAMAGE OR
WANT TO FILE A DOM PLAINT --

249
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
COMPLAINT AT THAT TIME.

250
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
>> GRETA: WHETHER OR NOT ANYONE

251
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
REPORTS DAMAGING DOESN'T MEAN

252
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
THERE HASN'T BEEN A CRIME, WHEN

253
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
SOMEBODY IS CUTTING DOWN A TENT

254
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
AND TERRORIZING AND SCARYING

255
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
PEOPLE.
YOU HAVE A CRIME.

256
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
WOULD YOU NOT AGREE?

257
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
>> YES, MA'AM.
HOWEVER THE TENTS WERE A LOW

258
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
PRIORITY AT THAT TIME THAT.

259
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
HAPPENED ON TUESDAY AND AT 2:00

260
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
TODAY, THE RIGHT TO WORK GROUP

261
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
DID FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE

262
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
MICHIGAN STATE POLICE.

263
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
AND WE WILL INVESTIGATE THAT.

264
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
>> GRETA: DO YOU HAVE -- DID YOU

265
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
HAVE ALL THE VIDEO YOU NEED TO

266
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
PERHAPS IDENTIFY -- WE HAVE SOME

267
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
VIDEO, OBVIOUSLY, DO YOU HAVE

268
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
THE TWO WHO ORIGINALLY WENT INTO

269
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
THE TENT WITH THE MASKS.

270
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
THEY WENT THEIR MASKS OFF.

271
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
>> WE HAVE LIMITED VIDEO.

272
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
AND OUR DETECTIVES HAVE NOT HAD

273
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
A CHANCE TO CHECK THAT YET.

274
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
AGAIN, THIS REPORT CAME IN AT

275
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
2:30 AND IT WAS JUST BARELY

276
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
PROCESSED TODAY.
>> GRETA: HAVE YOU HEARD ANY

277
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
REPORT INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT

278
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
OUR GUESTS HAVE SAID FROM LAST

279
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
NIGHT AND TONIGHT, OUR LIVE

280
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
GUESTS?

281
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
>> NO, MA'AM.
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS AN ASSAULT

282
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
ON A REPORTER ALSO.

283
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
AND THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS NOT

284
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
FILED A POLICE REPORT WITH THE

285
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
STATE POLICE YET YEERGHT.

286
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
>> GRETA: YOU KNOW, YOU WATCH

287
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
THIS AND IT'S DISGUSTING.

288
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
DO YOU AGREE?

289
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
THE VIOLENCE -- I MEAN, A HOTDOG

290
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
SELLING GUY -- I MEAN, WHY DO

291
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
THAT TO HIM?

292
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
>> MR. TARVAR IS AN INSTITUTION

293
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
IN DOWNTOWN LANSING.

294
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
VIEATEN HIS HOTDOGS MANY TIMES.

295
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
YOU KNOW, OVERALL, A CROWD OF

296
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
OVER 12,000 WERE WELL BEHAVED.

297
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WERE A

298
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
HANDFUL OF PEOPLE, WHETHER IT

299
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
WAS EMOTION OR WHATEVER, LET

300
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
THINGS GET OUT OF CONTROL AND

301
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
JUST GAVE THIS ENTIRE PROTEST A

302
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
BAD REPUTATION.

303
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
>> GRETA: I AM CURIOUS IF HE'S

304
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
AN INSTITUTION, WHETHER OR NOT

305
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
HE WAS TARGETED IN PARTICULAR

306
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
BECAUSE HE IS OBVIOUSLY SELLING

307
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
HOTDOGS INSIDE THE TENT OF ONE

308
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
SIDE OF THIS, IN THIS INSTANCE,

309
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING

310
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
THE NEW LAW.

311
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
WAS HE TARGETD?

312
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
THE RACIAL SLUSHES HURLED AT

313
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
HIM?

314
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
>> GRETA:.

315
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
>> WELL, THAT'S PART OF THE

316
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
CROWD MENTALITY.

317
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
HE HAPPENED TO BE AT THE WRONG

318
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME, WITH

319
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
THE WRONG GROUP, AS FAR AS THE

320
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
OTHER PROTESTERS FELT.

321
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
>> GRETA: ONE THING IS CERTAIN,

322
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHO

323
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
DID THIS TO THIS MAN AND THE

324
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
OTHER PEOPLE, CUTTING DOWN THE

325
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
TENT.
LUCKY THAT PEOPLE WEREN'T

326
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
MOTHERED, I SUPPOSE.

327
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
BY THE TENT.

328
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
IF PEOPLE HAVE THE DISEENS TOW

329
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
COME FORWARD AND GIVE YOU SOME

330
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
TIPS.

331
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I HOPE YOU GET THEM.

332
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

333
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
>> I HOPE IF PEOPLE DO HAVE

334
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
INFORMATION, THEY DO PRESENT IT

335
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
TO THE MICHIGAN STATE POLICE.

336
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
>> GRETA: THANK YOU, SIR.

337
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
>> YES, MA'AM.

338
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
>> GRETA: U.N. AMBASSADOR AND

339
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
HER ABRUPT WITHDRAWAL FROM THE

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
RAWNING FOR THE SECRETARY OF
STATE.

341
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
>> THE SECOND BIG STORY, SUSAN

342
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
RICE.
JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF HOUR,

343
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
CALL THEEING THE PRESIDENT,

344
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
SAYING SHE IS PULLING HER NAME

345
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR

346
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
SECRETARY OF STATE, ALL BECAUSE

347
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
OF THAT CONTROVERSY OVER

348
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
BENGHAZI, HER REACTION TO THE

349
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
TERROR ATTACK, WHETHER OR NOT

350
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
SHE MISLED THE PUBLIC.

351
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
>> BEST ASSESSMENT WE HAVE TODAY

352
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
IS THAT IN FACT, THIS WAS NOT A

353
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
PRE-PLANNED, PREMADE TITTED --

354
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
PREMEDITATED ATTACK.

355
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
>> I AM MORE TROUBLED TODAY,

356
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
KNOWING, HAVING MET WITH THE

357
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE CIA AND

358
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
AMBASSADOR RICE.
>> IT WAS A PONTANEOUS REACTION

359
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
TO WHAT HAD JUST TRANSPIRED IN

360
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
CAIRO, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE

361
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
VIDEO.

362
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
>> THE OBSESSIVE FOCUS ON

363
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
AMBASSADOR RICE'S APPEARANCE ON

364
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
A SERIES OF SUNDAY SHOWS IS

365
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
MISPLACED AND MISGUIDED.

366
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
>> WHY DID THE ADMINISTRATION

367
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
PULT HER OUT THERE AS THE

368
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
SPOKESPERSON?
>> IF SENATOR McCAIN AND

369
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
SENATOR GRAHAM AND OTHERS WANT

370
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
TO GO AFTER SOMEBODY, THEY

371
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
SHOULD GO AFTER ME.

372
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
>> SUSAN RICE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

373
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
BETTER.

374
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
IF SHE DIDN'T KNOW BETTER, SHE'S

375
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
NOT QUALIFIED.

376
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
>> BUT FOR THEM TO GO AFTER THE

377
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
U.N. AMBASSADOR, WHO HAD NOTHING

378
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
TO DO WITH BENGHAZI AND WAS

379
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
SIMPLY MAKING A PRESENTATION,

380
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
BASED ON INTELLIGENCE THAT SHE

381
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
HAD RECEIVED THAT BEMIMPED HER

382
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
REPUTATION IS OUTRAGEOUS.

383
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
>> I AM MORE DISTURBED NOW THAN

384
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I WAS BEFORE THAT THE 16th

385
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
OF SEPTEMBER EXPLANATION ABOUT

386
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
HOW FOUR AMERICANS DIED IN

387
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
BENGHAZI, LIBYA, BY AMBASSADOR

388
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
RICE, I THINK DOES NOT DO

389
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
JUSTICE TO THE REALITY AT THE

390
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
TIME.

391
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
AND IN MINDSIGHT CLEARLY WAS

392
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
COMPLETELY WRONG.

393
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
>> GRETA: IN A LETTER TO

394
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA, A SHORT TIME

395
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
AGO, AMBASSADOR RICE, WRITING IN

396
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
PART...

397
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
SHE CONTINUES AND SAYS...

398
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
SENATOR LINDSAY GRAHAM JOINS US.

399
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
>> GOOD EVENING.

400
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
>> GRETA: YOUR RESPONSE TO THE
LETTER THAT THE AMBASSADOR SENT

401
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
TO THE PRESIDENT, THREE OR FOUR

402
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
PARAGRAPH, ACCUSING THOSE WHO

403
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
CRITICIZE HER OF POLITICIZING IT

404
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
AND CAUSING AN IRRESPONSIBLE

405
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
DISAKZ DISTRACTION.

406
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
ARE YOU POLITICIZING IT?

407
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
ARE YOU CAUSING AN IRRESPONSIBLE

408
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
DISTRACTION?
>> I THINK THE PROBLEM HERE IS

409
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
THAT SHE WENT ON NATIONAL

410
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
TELEVISION, FIVE DAYS AFTER THE
ATTACK THAT KILLED FOUR

411
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
AMERICANS AND TOLD A STORY THAT

412
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
IS NOT BASED ON ANY REALITY THAT

413
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I HAVE SEEN.

414
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
SHE TOLD A POLITICAL STORY THREE

415
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION.

416
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
THEY SANITIZED THE INTELLIGENCE.

417
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
SHE SAYS THE CONSULATE WAS

418
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
STRONG, SUBSTANTIALLY AND

419
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
SIGNIFICANTLY DEFENDED.

420
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM
THE TRUTH.

421
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
SHE INDICATED THAT AL QAEDA WAS

422
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
DECIMATED, TRYING TO CONTINUE

423
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
THE NARRATIVE THAT THE PRESIDENT

424
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT SINCE THE

425
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
DEATH OF BIN LADEN, I COLD HER

426
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
ACCOUNTABLE AND -- I HOLD HER

427
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
ACCOUNTABLE AND RESPONSIBLE FOR

428
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
MISLEADING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

429
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I THINK SHE WAS CHOSE TONE

430
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
TELL -- FOR A REASON.

431
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
IF HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

432
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
BENGHAZI, AS THE PRESIDENT

433
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
INDICATED, WHY DID THEY PICK

434
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
HER?

435
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I THOUGHT SHE WAS THE MOST

436
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
POLITICALLY COMPLIANT PERSON

437
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
THEY COULD FIND.

438
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
AND THE STORY SHE TOLD DOESN'T

439
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
WITHSTAND SCRUTINY.

440
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
>> GRETA: DO YOU FACTOR INTO THE

441
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
EQUATION -- I CONFESS THAT I

442
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
DO -- SHE WENT ON FIVE SHOWS AND

443
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
IT TOOK 73 DAYS BEFORE SHE SAID

444
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
ANYTHING DIFFERENT AND THAT WAS

445
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
TO U.S. SENATORS BEHIND CLOSED

446
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
DOORS, BUT IT TOOK 73 DAYS

447
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
FORLER TO SPEAK OUT, NOT EVEN

448
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
PUBLICLY, BUT BEHIND CLOSED

449
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
DOORS.

450
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
>> I I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD

451
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
HAVE EVER SAID SHE WAS WRONG.

452
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
THIS IS NOT ABOUT SUSAN RICE.

453
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID, IF YOU HAVE

454
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
A PROBLEM WITH BENGHAZI -- I

455
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
DO -- IT IS NOT PICKING ON THE

456
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
PRESIDENT.
IT IS TRYING TO EXPOSE A

457
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
NATIONAL SECURITY FAILURE, A

458
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
DEBACLE.
I HOLD THE PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE

459
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
MORE THAN ANYTHINGCH -- MORE

460
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

461
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED OR

462
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
REINFORCED BEFORE THE ATTACK ON

463
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
9/11.
THERE IS NOTHING TO DO TO HELP

464
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
THE PEOPLE.

465
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
WHERE WAS HE AS COMMANDENER

466
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
CHIEF.
HAVE YOU TWO MOVIES BEING MADE

467
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
IN THE RAID ON BIN LADEN.

468
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

469
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID IN THE

470
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
SEVEN HOURS OF THE ATTACK.

471
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
AND AFTERWARD, THE PRESIDENT

472
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
TRIED TO BLAME THIS ON A VIDEO

473
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
AND A MOB AND A DEMONSTRATION

474
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
THAT NEVER EXISTED.

475
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
BUT SUSAN RICE, IN MY OPINION,

476
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
MISLED THE PUBLIC.

477
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS WITH

478
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
HER TIME AND POLITICS AND

479
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
NATIONAL FOREIGN AFFAIRS ARENA.

480
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
HER PROBLEMS WERE DEEPER THAN ME

481
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
AND DEEPER THAN BENGHAZI.

482
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
BUT WE WON'T LET THIS GO.

483
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
HOW COULD FOR SEVEN HOURS,

484
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
NOBODY COME TO THE AID OF THE

485
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
PEOPLE DURING THE ATTACK?

486
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
WHY DID WE LEAVE THE CONSULATE

487
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
OPEN?
WHERE WAS THE PRESIDENT WHEN THE

488
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
BRITISH DECIDED TO CLOSE THEIR

489
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
CONSULATE IN JUNE AND

490
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
AFTERWARDS, HOW DID THE

491
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
INTELLIGENCE GET SO SCREWED UP?

492
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
WE ARE GOING TO KEEP PRESSING

493
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
THIS SO WE CAN LEARN FROM IT AND

494
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
NOT HAVE IT HAPPEN AGAIN.

495
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
>> GRETA: THANK YOU, SIR.

496
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
>> THANK YOU.

497
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
>> GRETA: FORMER U.N. AMBASSADOR

498
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
JOHN BOLTON IS HERE.

499
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
>> GLAD TO BE HERE.

500
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
>> GRETA: YOU HEARD ME SAY TO

501
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
THE SENATOR NHER LETTER TO THE

502
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
PRESIDENT, SHE HAS AN OP-ED

503
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
PIECE IN THE WASHINGTON POST,

504
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
POLITICIZING, IRRESPONSIBLE
DISTRACTION, CRITICS OF HER AND

505
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
IN THE WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE,

506
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
SHE REFERS TO THE DEBATE ABOUT

507
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
HER AS BEING A POLITICAL

508
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
FOOTBALL.
HOW DO WE KNOW IF SHE IS RIGHT

509
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
OR WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A

510
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
FAIR SCRUTINY OF A GOVERNMENT

511
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
EMPLOYEE.
>> I THINK IT'S ALWAYS FAIR

512
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
SCRUTINY.
EVERYTHING YOU SAY IN PUBLIC

513
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
WHEN YOU ARE A SENIOR GOVERNMENT

514
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
OFFICIAL IS OPEN TO QUESTION.

515
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
AND IN FACT HERE, THE

516
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO HAVE IT

517
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
BOTH WAYS.

518
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
THEY TRIED TO GET THEIR STORY

519
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
LINE OUT THAT THE KILLINGS IN

520
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
BENGHAZI WERE CAUSED BY THE

521
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
MUHAMMAD VIDEO.
WHEN THE DATA SHOWED THAT THAT

522
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
WAS FANTASY, THEY TRIED TO

523
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
STONEWALL PAST THE ELECTION TO

524
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
STONEWALL PAST THE POSSIBLE

525
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
NOMINATION OF SECRETARY OF STATE

526
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
AND IT HAS FALLEN APART.

527
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
SUSAN RICE MAY BE AN UNFORTUNATE

528
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
VICTIM.

529
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
BUT THIS IS ALL DUE TO THE

530
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
PRESIDENT'S OWN STRATEGY.

531
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
>> GRETA: YOU KNOW, SHE IS

532
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
WITHDRAWING HER NAME FROM

533
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
CONSIDERATION.
SHE WAS NEVER NOMINATED.

534
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I DON'T KNOW IF THE PRESIDENT

535
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
SAID HE INTENDED TO NOMINATE

536
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
HER.
THIS IS LIKE EYE COULD SUBMIT A

537
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
LETTER WITHDRAWING MY NAME FROM

538
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
CONSIDERATION.
>> SURE, I COULD SIT AT HOME BY

539
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
THE PHONE AND WAIT FOR HIS CALL

540
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
TO TO NOMINATE ME.

541
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
>> GRETA: WHY DID SHE SEND THAT

542
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
LETTER AND MAKE IT PUBLIC AND

543
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
WHY TONIGHT?

544
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
>> I THINK THEY HAD COME TO A

545
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
POLITICAL CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS

546
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
TOO COST THREE GO FORWARD AND

547
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
SHE WANTED TO GET HER TWO CENTS

548
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
WORTH IN ON THAT.

549
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I WOULD BE SURPRISED NOW IF

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
NETWORK IT'S NONE OF THEM HAVE

910
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
BEEN GIVEN THIS INFORMATION.

911
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
IT'S BEEN TYPICAL WHEN WE HAVE

912
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
PEOPLE KILLED KILLED IN IRAQ,

913
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
AFGHANISTAN, THE NAMES ARE HELD

914
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
FOR MAYBE 48 HOURS, BUT WE DON'T

915
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
KNOW HOW MANY THEY ARE, WHO THE

916
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
FAMILIES ARE, WE WOULD LIKE TO

917
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
TALK TO THEM.

918
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
>> GRETA: AS A HOUSE REPUBLICAN,

919
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
YOU ARE IN THE MAJORITY PARTY,

920
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
WHY DON'T YOU DROP A SUBPOENA ON

921
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
SOMEONE AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT

922
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
TO SHOW UP AND ASK THAT PERSON

923
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
UNDER OATH WHO ARE THE PEOPLE

924
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
WHO WERE EVACUATED FROM

925
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
BENGHAZI?

926
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
AND WHERE ARE THEY?

927
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
>> BELIEVE ME, I AM A LITTLE BIT

928
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
FRUSTRATED THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN

929
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
ISSUING SUBPOENAS.

930
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
WHAT WE ARE WAITING FOR, THOUGH,

931
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
IS THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO ISSUE

932
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
THEIR REPORT.

933
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
REMEMBER, THEY SAID THEY WEREN'T

934
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
GOING TO OFFER ANY INFORMATION

935
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
UNTIL THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION

936
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
WAS DONE.

937
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
THEY SAID THAT COULD TAKE 60 TO

938
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
65 DAYS, NOW THAT IT'S MON 3,

939
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
THEY OPOWE US A REPORT.

940
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
THAT'S I DIDN'T THINK SUSAN RICE

941
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT.

942
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I THINK WE ARE THE VERGE OF

943
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
GETTING THE REPORT.

944
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
BUT THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS

945
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
SCWIRNLING, SAYING MAYBE WE WILL

946
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
GIVE YOU THE SUMMARY.

947
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
SECRETARY CLINTON MIGHT NOT COME

948
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
UP.
THE REPORT, IF DONE ACCURATELY,

949
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
IS GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFICULT

950
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
THING FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AND

951
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE

952
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND THE

953
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
CIA TO EXPLAIN.

954
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I AM OPT MISTSIC, BUT I THINK

955
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
THAT'S WHY SUSAN RICE MADE THE

956
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY.

957
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
IT IS ALREADY LATE.

958
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
>> GRETA: JUST TO FILL IN THE

959
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
BLANKS, THE ACCOUNTABILITY

960
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
REVIEW BOARD, WITHIN THE

961
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
DEPARTMENT OF THE STATE AND TOM

962
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
PICKERRING AND ADMIRAL MIKE

963
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
MULLEN ARE CONDUCTING THE

964
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
INVESTIGATION AND THE

965
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
EXPECTATION IS THAT ON DECEMBER

966
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
20, SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY

967
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
CLINTON WILL BE TESTIFYING ON

968
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
CAPITOL HILL BEFORE THE HOUSE

969
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND

970
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS

971
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
COMMITTEE AND TALKING ABOUT THAT

972
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
REPORTS.
SO PRESUMABLY, IT WILL BE

973
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
COMPLETED BEFORE THEN.

974
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
BUT LATE TODAY, WE HAVE BEEN

975
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
HEARING NOISE THAT THE ENTIRE

976
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
REPORT WON'T BE RELEASED.

977
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
GO FIGURE.

978
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
THEY MAY CLAIM DLOIF CLASSIFIED

979
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
TOZE US, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY

980
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE

981
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
WOULDN'T GET THE FULL AND

982
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
COMPLETE REPORT.
>> IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

983
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
ONE OF THE CONCERNS WITH THOSE

984
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
WHO WERE INJURED IS HOW THEY

985
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
WERE EXTRACTED.

986
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
THE FIRE FIGHT STARTS AT 9:40

987
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

988
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
DOESN'T LEAVE GERMANY UNTIL 2:00

989
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
P.M. AND DOESN'T GET BACK UNTIL

990
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
THE 10:00 P.M. HOUR.

991
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
MEANWHILE -- NOBODY'S SAID THIS

992
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
ON TELEVISION, NOBODY'S

993
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
MENTIONED THIS -- THEY THOUGHT

994
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
THEY WERE GOING TO BE ATTACKED

995
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
IN TRIPOLI, THE EMBASSY WAS

996
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
EVACUATED IN TRIPOLI.

997
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
YET WHETHER THEY HAVE THE

998
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
INJURED PEOPLE ON THE TARMAC,

999
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
THEY ARE SEVERELY INJURED, THEY

1000
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
SEND AN AIRPLANE OVER TO

1001
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
BENGHAZI AND THEY RETURNED TO

1002
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
TRIPOLI -- INSTEAD OF GOING TO

1003
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
ITALY OR TO GERMANY -- THEN THE

1004
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
C-17 HAS TO COME -- IT MAKES NO

1005
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
SENSE.
IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE.

1006
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
>> GRETA: THE IRONY AND I HAVE

1007
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
NO SYMPATHY FOR THE

1008
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
ADMINISTRATION'S CLAIMING THIS

1009
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
IS POLITICIZED BECAUSE IF THEY

1010
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
WOULD JUST SIMPLY ANSWER THESE

1011
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
QUESTIONS, NOT DRAG THEIR FEET,

1012
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
MAYBE WE WILL GET IT IN THE NEXT

1013
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
6 OR 7 DAYS, BUT IF THEY WOULD

1014
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
FILL IN THE BLANKS, NOBODY WOULD

1015
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
BE SUSPICIOUS.

1016
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
WE GET SILLY ANSWERS THAT DON'T

1017
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
MAKE SENSE -- THAT'S THE

1018
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
PROBLEM.
THAT IS CREATED BY THOSE WHO

1019
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
HOLD THE FACTS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT!

1020
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I AM NOT TRYING TO POLITICIZE

1021
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
THIS.
WE HAVE INJURED AMERICANS!

1022
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
IN THE WORST CASE TTAKES 25

1023
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
HOURS TO EXTRACT THEM TO A

1024
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
FACILITY, AN AMERICAN FACILITY,

1025
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
THEY'RE IN GERMANY.

1026
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
AT THE BEST CASE, MAYBE 18 HOURS

1027
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
AND THE ADMINISTRATION WON'T

1028
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS.

1029
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
THESE ARE LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS.

1030
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I WANT TO TALK TO THAT FAMILY.

1031
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
THEY DESERVE TO HAVE ANSWERS.

1032
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THIS NEVER,

1033
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
EVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

1034
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
WHEN AN AMERICAN GOES DOWN, WE

1035
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
GO GET HIM.

1036
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
THIS PRESIDENT DIDN'T DO THAT.

1037
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
>> GRETA: IF YOU DON'T GET THE

1038
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
ANSWERS NEXT WEEK,URE IN THE

1039
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
MAJORITY PARTY, YOU HAVE THE

1040
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
ABILITY TO DO IT.

1041
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
YOU SHOULD ANY GO AHEAD AND DO .

1042
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
YOU HAVE THE POWER TO GET THE

1043
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
INFORMATION.
SO IF YOU COMPLAIN AND YOU DON'T

1044
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
DO ANYTHING, YOU ARE

1045
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
POLITICIZING IT.

1046
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
>> I AM ARGUING WITH YOU THERE.

1047
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I AGREE WITH YOU.

1048
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
>> GRETA: COMING UP, TABOO

1049
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
TOPICS, THE PROPOSED ARMY

1050
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
HANDBOOK, FORBIDDING U.S. TROOPS

1051
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
TO INSULT THE TALIBAN, THAT

1052
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
TALIBAN THAT INSULTS WOMEN.

1053
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
THAT'S NOT ALL THAT THEY FORBID.

1054
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
THAT'S NEXT.

1055
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
AND IN TWO MINUTES, ULTIMATE

1056
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
GOVERNMENT FIGHTING.

1057
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
A PARLIAMENT SESSION, TUSHED

1058
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
INTO A BARROOM BRAWL.

1059
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
WHERE DID THIS HAPPEN?

1060
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
AND HOW DID IT END?

1061
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
THAT'S 2 MINUTES AWAY.

1062
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Music is a universal language.

1063
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
But when I was in an accident...

1064
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I was worried the
health care system

1065
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
spoke a language all its own

1066
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
With UnitedHealthcare,
I got help that fit my life.

1067
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Information on my phone.

1068
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Connection to doctors who
get where I'm from.

1069
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And tools to estimate what
my care may cost.

1070
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So I never missed a beat.

1071
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
We're more than 78,000
people looking out for

1072
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
more than 70
million Americans.

1073
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
That's health in numbers.
UnitedHealthcare.

1074
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
>> GRETA: IF YOU THOUGHT MEMBERS

1075
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
OF OUR CONGRESS DON'T GET ALONG,

1076
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
CHECK THIS OUT.

PARLIAMENT SESSION, FIGHTS

1080
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
BREAKING OUT TWO DAYS IN A ROW

1081
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
IN THE GROUP'S OPENING SESSION.

1082
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
THE GROUP GETTING OFF TO A

RATHER ROCKY START.

1084
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
THE BATTLE IS BETWEEN THE

1085
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
OPPOSITION AND THE MAJORITY

1086
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
PARTIES.
THEY COULDN'T AGREE ON CHOOSING

1087
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
A NEW SPEAKER, SO THIS IS HOW

1088
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
THEY TRIED TO SETTLE THEIR

1089
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
