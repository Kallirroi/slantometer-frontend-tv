434

TIMES INSIDE THE HOUSE, THAT IS

YOU KNOW, THERE HASN'T BEEN MUCH

440
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
ACTIVITY SINCE YESTERDAY

441
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
AFTERNOON, UP UNTIL ABOUT -- I

442
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
WOULD SAY A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR

443
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
AGO, WE WATCHED ABOUT SIX POLICE

444
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
CARS DRIVE UP SEVERAL OFFICIALS

445
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
GOT OUT OF THEIR CAR, TALKED A

446
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
BUILT AND THEN GOT BACK IN THE

447
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
CARS AND DROVE OFF, WE ASSUME TO

448
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
ADAM LANZA'S HOUSE.

449
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
WE LEARNED FROM STATE POLICE,
THEIR FOCUS WAS ON THIS SCHOOL.

450
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
THEY FOUND THAT FOUR WEAPONS

451
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
WERE FOUND AT THE SCHOOL, THREE

452
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
FOUND IN THE CLASSROOM A SHOTGUN

453
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
WAS FOUND IN LANZA'S CAR THAT

454
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.

455
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
WE ALSO LEARNED THAT LANZA

456
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
MOSTLY USED A SEMIAUTOMATIC

457
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
WEAPON CALLED A BUSHMASTER

458
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
INSIDE THE SCHOOL TO KILL THOSE

459
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
26 PEOPLE INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

460
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
HE HAD, AS YOU SAID, HE SHOT

461
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
DOZENS OF BULLETS AND HE HAD

462
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
HUNDREDS OF UNUSED AMMUNITION AS

463
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
WELL, HUNDREDS OF BULLETS.

464
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
SO IT WAS IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY

465
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER CAME OUT

466
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
YESTERDAY AND EXPLAINED HOW ADAM

467
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
LANZA SHOT THOSE 26 PEOPLE

468
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
MULTIPLE TIMES, SOME OF THEM, HE

469
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
SHOT, SAID THE MEDICAL EXAMINER,

470
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
THREE TO 11 TIMES.

471
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
IT'S CLEAR THAT LANZA CARRYING

472
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
THAT MUCH AMMUNITION ON HIM WAS

473
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
LOOKING TO CAUSE THE MOST

474
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
DESTRUCTION AND DEATH.

475
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
WOLF?
>> WHAT A HORRIFIC, HORRIFIC

476
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
CRIME.

477
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
ALISON, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

478
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR SO MANY

479
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
FAMILIES.
BRING IN OUR CHIEF MEDICAL

480
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
CORRESPONDENT, DR. SANJAY GUPTA,

481
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
HERE WITH US NOW.

482
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER,

483
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
THAT IS GOING TO BE A HUGE

484
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
PROBLEM?
>> IT IS.

485
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
WE ARE USED TO TALKING ABOUT

486
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
THIS IN THE CONTEXT OVER ADULTS

487
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
BUT IT CAN HAPPEN IN CHILDREN

488
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
AND IT CAN HAPPEN QUICKLY.

489
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I THINK THAT'S TWO THINGS PEOPLE

490
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
DON'T ALWAYS REALIZE, HOW THE

491
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
CHILDREN BEHAVE NOW, HOW A LOT

492
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
OF THESE THINGS ARE IMPLEMENTED

493
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
THAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

494
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
WITH PEOPLE OVER THE LAST COUPLE
OF DAYS, IS GOING TO MAKE A BIG

495
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
DIFFERENCE, IF CERTAIN

496
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
CONVERSATIONS ARE HAD, IF

497
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
SPECIAL CARE IS TAKEN TO MAKE

498
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
SURE THAT CHILDREN ARE SLEEPING

499
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
WELL, FOR EXAMPLE, THEY ARE

500
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
GOING TO BE ABLE TO COPE MUCH

501
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
BETTER IN THE LONG RUNS, YOU CAN

502
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
PREDICT, YOU KNOW, CERTAIN

503
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS IN TERMS

504
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
OF THAT COPING BY WHAT'S

505
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
HAPPENING THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

506
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
>> WE THINK OF POSTTRAUMATIC

507
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
STRESS DISORDER, TROOPS COMING

508
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
HOME FROM AFGHANISTAN OR IRAQ.

509
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY VERY DIFFERENT

510
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
FROM THAT.

511
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS WHAT

512
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
SHOULD WE BE LOOKING FORWARD TO?

513
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ILLNESS?

514
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
>> ADULTS, YOU THINK ABOUT

515
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
THINGS LIKE HYPER VIGILANCE,

516
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
DIFFICULTY SLEEPING, ALMOST

517
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
HASTY REACTION.

518
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
IN CHILDREN, CAN BE VERY

519
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
DIFFERENT.
SOMETIMES DON'T VERBALIZE IT

520
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
HARD LATE ALL, CHANGES IN HOW

521
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
THEY PLAY.
THEY MAY, IN FACT, START PLAYING

522
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
TOY GUNS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

523
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
IF THEY DIDN'T BEFORE.

524
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
THEY CAN HAVE REGRESSION.

525
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
SO, A 6-YEAR-OLD CAN START

526
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
ACTING LIKE A YOUNGER CHILD, FOR

527
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
EXAMPLE.
AND AGAIN, JUST PAYING ATTENTION

528
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
TO THOSE THINGS AND NOT SORT OF

529
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
GLOSSING OVER, OBVIOUSLY DON'T

530
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
WANT TO PROVIDE GRAPHIC DETAILS,

531
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
MAKE SURE YOU ARE HAVING

532
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
CONVERSATIONS, KID GOES BACK

533
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
TOLE SCHOOL, DON'T KNOW ABOUT

534
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
WHAT HAPPENED YET, THEY WILL BY

535
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
TOMORROW.

536
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
>> THEY WILL IF THEIR PARENTS

537
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
DIDN'T TELL THEM, TEACHERS MIGHT

538
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
TELL THEM OR CLASSMATES.

539
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
>> SOCIAL MEDIA.

540
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
THEY WILL HEAR ABOUT.

541
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
IT IS AN JAY IS GOING TO BE WITH

542
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
US THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.

543
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
WE ARE AWAITING THE PRESIDENT OF

544
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
THE UNITED STATES.
HE IS COMING HERE TO NEWTOWN TO

545
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
BRING SOME COMFORT TO THE

546
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
FAMILIES, THE FIRST RESPONDERS,

547
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
ALSO, HE WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE

548
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
INTERFAITH VIGIL THAT WILL BE

549
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
TAKING PLACE HERE IN

551
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES RIGHT

YOU ALWAYS THINK IT'S GONNA

782
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
HAPPEN SOMEWHERE ELSE, NOT HERE.

783
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
WE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS -- AND TO

793
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
THINK THAT I COULD GO HOME AND

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
HUG MY KIDS AND SO MANY PARENTS

795
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
OUT THERE CAN'T.

IT'S HEARTBREAKING.

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
HEARTBREAKING.

00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I CAN'T FATHOM SOMEBODY CAN DO

813
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000

NUMBER OF TIMES, YOU KNOW, WE

843
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
DON'T WANT OUR TOWN TO BE KNOWN

844
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
FOR THIS WE ARE MUCH MORE THAN A

845
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
POINT, I'M SURE YOU HAVE HEARD

846
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000

853
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
ABOUT, DON.

858
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

859
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
WHY I DO HEAR THE SIGH REMEMBER.

860
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
THE PRESIDENT WASN'T HERE YET,

861
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE.

862
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
AND I SAID THIS TOWN HAS

863
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
CHANGED, HASN'T IT?

864
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
YEAH EARTHQUAKE IT'S LIKE BEING

AT A CIRCUS, QUITE FRANKLY, BUT

866
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
NOBODY IS HAVING FUN.

867
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
THIS HAS GONE FROM A BUCOLIC,

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000

871
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY WANT THEIR

872
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
TOWN TO BE KNOWN FOR.

873
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
THEY WANT IT TO BE KNOWN FOR THE

874
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
TYPE OF TOWN, YOU KNOW, NEW

875
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
ENGLAND TOWN THAT LOOKS LIKE A

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
ME, I HAD NEVER MET HER BEFORE

920
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
AND JUST GAVE ME A HUG.

921
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I THINK IT'S THERAPEUTIC.

922
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
IT'S CATHARTIC, TO SOME HE

923
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
EXTENT.
THE WHOLE IDEA THAT YOU DO

924
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
SOMETHING, WHATEVER IT MAY BE,

925
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
AND THAT SOMEHOW YOU FEEL

926
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
BETTER, MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY, BY

927
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
ACTUALLY GOING OUT AND DOING

928
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
SOMETHING, I THINK IT'S

929
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
EMPOWERING IN SOME WAY, TAKES

930
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
AWAY THOSE FEELINGS OF ISOLATION

931
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND

932
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
PEOPLE GATHERING TOGETHER, I

933
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
THINK, I THINK THIS IS OUR

934
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
DEFAULT POSITION, WOLF, I THINK

935
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HUMAN SPIRIT

936
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
THIS IS THE DEFAULT POSITION,

937
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
WHO WE ARE NORMALLY, WE RARELY

938
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS

939
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
IT.
SOMETIMES A TRAGEDY LIKE THIS

940
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
BRINGS IT OUT.

941
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I THINK IT'S JUST PART OF WHO WE

942
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
ARE AND WE ARE SEEING THIS SORT

943
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
OF THING PLAY OUT, NOT JUST HERE

944
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
IN NEWTOWN, BUT I THINK IN MANY

945
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
PRAISES AROUND THE COUNTRY.

946
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I WAS TALKING TO MY WIFE AND SHE

947
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
WAS SWAG HER OWN FRIENDS LAST
NIGHT, THEY GOT TOGETHER AND

948
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
WERE TALKING A LOT ABOUT THIS

949
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
AND I THINK REALLY TRYING TO

950
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
COMFORT EACH OTHER AND I THINK

951
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
IT'S EMPOWERING AND AGAIN, VERY

952
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
THERAPEUTIC FOR THEM.

953
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
>> SO MANY PEOPLE ARE STAYING IS

954
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
SO PAINFUL TO WATCH BUT THEY

955
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
WANT TO WATCH, AT THE SAME TIME.

956
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
THEY DON'T WANT TO ESCAPE.

957
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
THEY DON'T WANT TO RUNAWAY FROM

958
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
THIS, BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A

959
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
STORY, A MOVIE, THIS IS REAL

960
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
LIFE, WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

961
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
>> I THINK, JUST FROM A MEDIA

962
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
PERSPECTIVE, PEOPLE COMING UP TO

963
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
US WANTING TO TALK.

964
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I THINK VERY NATURAL FOR US NOT

965
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
TO WANT TO INFRINGE.

966
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
WE WOULDN'T WANT TO TO HAVE

967
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
PEOPLE INFRINGING ON OUR FRIENDS

968
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
SOMETHING SO TRAGIC HAPPENED.

969
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I THINK MAYBE IT'S TO HONOR THE

970
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
PEOPLE AROUND HERE.

971
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
MAYBE IT'S TO HONOR THE VICTIMS

972
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
HERE IN NEWTOWN.

973
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
MAYBE IT'S JUST TO, AGAIN, HAVE

974
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
THAT FEELING OF BEING EMPOWERED,

975
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
DOING SOMETHING.
I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU.

976
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
>> WE ARE STANDING BY, THE

977
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
IS -- WILL BE HERE FOR THIS

978
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
INTERFAITH VIGIL.

979
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
YESTERDAY, I HAD A CHANCE TO

980
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
SPEAK WITH A MINISTER AND RABBI

981
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
LEADING THIS VIGIL.
THAT IS COMING UP.

982
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
THE SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE

983
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
VIGIL WILL BEGIN AS SOON AS THE

984
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
PRESIDENT IS HERE.

985
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
ALSO, MUCH MORE OF THE AFTERMATH

986
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
OF THIS HORRENDOUS SHOOTING,

987
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
RIGHT AFTER THIS.

988
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
SPEAK WITH A MINISTER AND RABBI

989
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
LEADING THIS VIGIL.

990
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
LEADING THIS VIGIL.
Ñe

991
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
>>> ALL 20 OF THE SLAIN CHILDREN

992
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
IN THE CONNECTICUT SHOOTING, 6

993
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
OR 7 YEARS OLD.

994
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
IT'S SO SHOCKING TO HEAR THOSE

995
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
AGES, 6 OR 7.

996
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
YOUNG VICTIMS OF A SENSELESS,

997
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
HORRIBLE ATTACK.

998
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
JOINING ME RIGHT NOW FROM

999
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
SEATTLE IS VICTORIA HALLER.

1000
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
HER NEPHEW, 6-YEAR-OLD NOAH

1001
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
POZNER, WAS KILLED IN THE

1002
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
SHOOTING.
I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

1003
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
HOW ARE YOU, HOW IS YOUR FAMILY

1004
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
HOLDING UP?
>> THANK YOU, ANDERSON.

1005
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
WE ARE ALL COMPLETELY SHATTERED.

1006
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
IT'S BEEN VERY, VERY ROUGH FEW

1007
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
DAYS.
NOBODY'S GETTING VERY MUCH

1008
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
SLEEP.

1009
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
WE ARE HOLDING TOGETHER AS BEST

1010
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
WE CAN BUT YOU NEVER, EVER THINK

1011
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS CAN CAN

1012
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
HAPPEN TO YOUR FAMILY.

1013
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
>> TELL US ABOUT NOAH WHAT KIND

1014
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
OF A BOY WAS HE?

1015
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
>> NOAH WAS EXTREMELY LIVELY, HE

1016
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
WAS REALLY THE LIGHT OF THE

1017
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
ROOM.

1018
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
YOU KNOW, HE HAD A HUGE HEART

1019
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
AND HE WAS SO MUCH FUN.

1020
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
A LITTLE BIT RAM BURBUNCTIOUS, D

1021
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
PLAYING WITH HIS COUSINS, LOVED

1022
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
HIS TWIN MOST OF ALL AND ALWAYS

1023
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
SAID THAT THEY WERE BEST

1024
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
FRIENDS.

1025
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
THOSE BIG BLUE EYES, A GORGEOUS,

1026
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
GORGEOUS BOY.

1027
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
HE COULD GET WHAT HE WANTED JUST

1028
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
BY BATTING THOSE LONG EYELASHES

1029
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
AND LOOK IT'S WITH YOU THOSE BIG

1030
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
BLUE EYES, YOU REALLY COULDN'T

1031
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
SAY NO TO HIM.

1032
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
>> NOAH HAS TWO STARS THIS

1033
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
ATTENDED THE SAME SCHOOL,

1034
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
THANKFULLY YOU BOTH GIRLS

1035
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
SURVIVED THE ATTACK AND I KNOW

1036
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
ONE WAS DESCRIBED AS HIS BEST

1037
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
FRIEND, HIS TWIN SISTER, ARIAL.

1038
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
>> YES.

1039
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
>> HAVE THEY BEEN TOLD?

1040
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
DO THEY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?
>> THEY DON'T KNOW THE WAY IN

1041
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
WHICH NOAH PASSED AWAY, BUT

1042
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
OBVIOUSLY, THEY WERE THERE

1043
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
DURING THE WHOLE EVENT AND WERE

1044
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
LED OUT, IT'S NOT SOMETHING

1045
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
THAT, YOU KNOW, SHE JUST TURNED

1046
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
SI
SIX, ARIEL JUST TURNED 6.

1047
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
HOW DO YOU TELL THEM THAT IS HOW

1048
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
THEIR BROTHER DIED?

1049
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
IT IS THE UNTHINKABLE REALLY.

1050
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
>> I KNOW OFF SON NOAH'S AGE.

1051
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
SO MANY PARENTS HERE AND AROUND

1052
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
THE WORLD ARE TRYING TO FIGURE

1053
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
OUT HOW TO TALK TO THEIR KIDS

1054
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

1055
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I'M WONDERING JUST AS A PARENT,

1056
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
HOW DO YOU TALK TO YOUR SON

1057
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

1058
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
>> IT WAS EMOTION A.M. AND TE  -

1059
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
TEAR-FILLED AND WE NEEDED TO DO
IT RIGHT AWAY.

1060
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
WE IMMEDIATELY CALLED A GRIEF

1061
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
COUNSELOR HERE IN SEATTLE TO GET

1062
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
ADVICE BECAUSE IT IS NOTHING WE

1063
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH BEFORE.

1064
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
HIS ADVICE WAS TO TELL THEM

1065
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
ENOUGH DETAILS SO THEY DON'T

1066
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
FILL IN THE BLANKS THEMSELVES

1067
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
BECAUSE CHILDREN HAVE VERY

1068
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
ACTIVE IMAGINATIONS AND THEY

1069
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
WILL THINK THE WORST.

1070
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED.
WE TOLD THEM THAT A BAD PERSON

1071
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
CAME AND SHOT HIS COUSIN AND

1072
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
THAT HE HAD PASSED AWAY AND OUR
SON ASKED WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1073
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
IT MEANS HE DIED.

1074
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
AND HE, YOU KNOW, WAS GOING TO

1075
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
TRY AND IT IS JUST -- I THINK

1076
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
INCOMPREHENSIBLE FOR A BOY

1077
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
THAT'S NOT EVEN 6 YET.

1078
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
NOAH AND ARIEL AND MY SON,

1079
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
ETHAN, SIX WEEKS APART, THEY

1080
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
WERE SO CLOSE AND THEY WERE JUST

1081
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
BUDDIES AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S SO

1082
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
SO PAINFUL KNOWING THAT NOW, MY

1083
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
SON IS GONNA GROW UP WITHOUT HIS

1084
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
MALE COUSIN BUDDY, YOU KNOW?

1085
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
THAT WAS HIS -- THAT WAS HIS

1086
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
GUY.
AND TALKING TO HIM PRIMARILY ON

1087
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
FRIDAY AND THROUGHOUT THE

1088
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
WEEKEND, WHEN I'M EMOTIONAL,

1089
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
IT'S HARD TO KEEP IT TOGETHER,

1090
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
EVEN THOUGH I HAVE TO AT THE

1091
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
MOMENT BECAUSE I'M ONLY ONE AT

1092
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
HOME WITH MY TWO KIDS.

1093
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
MY HUSBAND IS WITH HIS SISTER

1094
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
AND MY MOTHER-IN-LAW AND TAKING

1095
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
CARE OF EVERYTHING OUT THERE.

1096
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I JUST TELL THEM I'M SAD AND

1097
