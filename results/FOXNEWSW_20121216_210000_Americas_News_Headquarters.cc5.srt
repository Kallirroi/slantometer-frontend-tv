LIVES BY PUTTING HERSELF IN THE

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000

MEANINGFUL ACTION THAT BOTH

ALL OF THESE WEAPONS WILL BE

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
VERY IMPORTANT THROUGHOUT THE

HORRIFIC TRAGEDY.

244
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
THAT IS AN ONGOING STRUGGLE OF

245
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000

254
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000

IT REALLY BACK THE TRAUMA OF THE

262
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
DAY.

263
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
>> Heather: WHAT ARE THESE

264
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
PARENTS, THESE FAMILIES, WHAT

265
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000

YOURSELF?

269
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
>> TOTAL SHOCK.

270
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
OVERWHELMING GRIEF.

271
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
YOU QUESTION YOUR FAITH IN GOD.

272
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS

273
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I THINK FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND

274
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
THAT GOES THROUGH THIS IS THAT

275
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
GOD DID NOT TAKE THEM.

276
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
EVIL WANTS TO TAKE AWAY YOUR

277
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
FAITH IN GOD.

278
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
DON'T LET IT.

279
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING

280
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
EVERYTHING.

281
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
THEY EVENTUALLY ONCE THE SHOCK

282
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000

283
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
AND FUNCTION AGAIN.

284
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
MOST OF ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE

285
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
SUFFERING WANT TO FIND A WAY TO

286
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
HONOR THEIR LOVED ONES FOR THE

287
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
GREATER GOOD OF EVERYONE.

288
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
THAT IS WHAT THE AURORA SHOOTING

289
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
VICTIMS ARE DOING.

290
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
TO THAT END I WOULD REALLY

291
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
ENCOURAGE THE GOVERNOR OF

292
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000

HOOK --.

297
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
>> Heather: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

298
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
>> SOON AFTER NATIONAL TRAGEDY

299
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
LIKE THIS, ALL THESE FUNDS START

300
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
UP AND THEY COLLECT MONEY.

301
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
MOST IF NOT -- QUITE A FEW OF

302
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
THEM MONEY NEVER GETS DIRECTLY

303
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000

305
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000

MONEY IS GOING DIRECTLY TO HELP

311
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
THE VICTIMS.

312
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
A VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND IS

313
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
SET UP OR GIVE TO A NONPROFIT

314
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
AND MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY

315
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000

316
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
IT HAPPENED TO THE VICTIMS OF

317
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000

318
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000

A LOT OF THESE FAMILIES KNOW

376
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
EACH OTHER.

377
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
THEY SHOULD REACH OUT TO EACH

378
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
OTHER AND HELP EACH OTHER

379
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
THROUGH THIS.

380
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
THERE IS SO FEW PEOPLE THAT GO

381
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THIS ON A

382
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
NATIONAL SCALE.

SEE WHAT THEY NEED AND GO

394
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
THROUGH THAT PERSON SO THE

395
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
FAMILIES AREN'T CONSTANTLY BEING

396
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
BARRAGED.

397
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
>> Heather: THANK YOU SO MUCH

398
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000

YOU SAID.

HILLARY CLINTON SUFFERING A FALL

404
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000

>> AND OFFERING PRAYERS FOR THE

406
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
VICTIMS FOR THE HORRIFIC

407
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
SHOOTING IN CONNECTICUT.

408
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
>> WE HEARD EVERYTHING, THE

409
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
SHOTS AND DOORS SLAMMING AND

410
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
PEOPLE YELLING.

411
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
HER HEART WAS RACING.

412
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
SHE WAS SCARED.

413
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
...so as you cans
customer satisfaction is at 97%.

414
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Mmmm tasty.

415
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And cut! Very good.

416
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

417
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

418
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

419
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's not real.

420
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

421
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

422
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

423
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

424
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000

OF TRAGEDY SHOOTING, SUPPORT IS

428
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
BEEN POURING IN BY COMING

429
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
TOGETHER AT SUNDAY CHURCH

430
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
SERVICES AND DOING WHATEVER THEY

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
CAN TO HELP HEAL PEOPLE THEY

432
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
PROBABLY NEVER MET WHILE COMING

433
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
TO TERMS WITH EMOTIONS OF THEIR

434
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
OWN.

435
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
>> WE JUST GOT IN FROM

436
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
WASHINGTON, D.C. AND I SAY WHAT

437
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
WAS HAPPENING.

438
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
WE HAD TO GET BACK.

439
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
PRAY TO GOD TO HELP HEAL THESE

440
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
PEOPLE THAT LOST CHILDREN.

441
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
WE HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS.

442
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST

443
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
FEEL LIKE.

444
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
>> PEOPLE WATCH THIS STUFF ON TV

445
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
AND COME AND SHOW YOUR SUPPORT.

446
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
LAY DOWN FLOWERS AND SHOW YOUR

447
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
SUPPORT.

448
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
>> IT'S AN UNIMAGINABLE LOSS.

449
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN SAY TO

450
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
CONSOLE THEM.

451
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
>> PEOPLE AT ONE NEWTOWN CHURCH,

452
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
THEY HAD A REPORTED BOMB THREAT

453
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
BUT POLICE GAVE THEM THE ALL

454
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
CLEAR SHORTLY AFTER THE CALL WAS

455
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
CALLED IN.

456
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
>> Gregg: NEW REPORTS SHOWING

457
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
SMALL BUSINESSES ARE FEELING THE

458
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
EFFECT IF DEMOCRATS AND

459
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
REPUBLICANS DON'T REEF AN

460
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
AGREEMENT SOON.

461
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
JOINING US IS BRENDA BUTTNER.

462
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
NEWLY SMAUL BUSINESSES THEY HAVE

463
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
TO BUDGET IN ADVANCE.

464
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
THEY HAVE TO BUDGET FOR THE

465
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
COMING QUARTER.

466
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
SO THEY ARE ALREADY TIGHTENING

467
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
THEIR BELT?
>> YOU BUDGET BASED ON WHAT THE

468
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
ECONOMY IS GOING TO DO OR WHAT

469
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
THE CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO

470
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
SPEND.

471
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
WE HAD KEY SURVEYS THAT THE

472
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
OPTIMISM LEVEL OF SMALL BUSINESS

473
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
LEVELS IS AT RECORD LOWS CLOSE

474
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
TO WHAT IT WAS IN 2008 AND 2009

475
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
WHEN BASICALLY THE RECESSION

476
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
STARTED AND FINANCIAL MESS

477
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
IMPLODED.

478
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
50% OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS

479
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
THINK THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO

480
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
GET WORSE IN THE ECONOMY IN THE

481
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
NEXT SIX MONTHS.

482
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
IF YOU ARE DYING TO BUY THAT

483
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
COMPUTER OR HIRE THAT NEW PERSON

484
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
AND YOU THINK THINGS ARE GOING

485
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
TO GET WORSE, YOU REIN IN.

486
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
>> SMALL BUSINESSES CREATE 64%

487
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
OF NAY JOBS IN AMERICA.

488
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
THEY EMPLOY HALF OF THE WORKERS

489
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
IN UNITED STATES.

490
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
THE PRESIDENT IS HOLDING

491
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
ABSOLUTELY FIRM, I WANT TO RAISE

492
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
TAX RATES ON THOSE EARNING ABOVE

493
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
$250,000 A YEAR.

494
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
THAT IS 8 A 5% OF THE SMALL

495
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
BUSINESSES, ISN'T IT -- THAT IS

496
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
85% OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES,

497
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
ISN'T IT?

498
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
>> WHAT THEY DO IS FILE AS

499
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
INDIVIDUALS.

500
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
SO IF THE RATES ON INDIVIDUALS

501
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
ARE RAISED, NOT JUST ON PEOPLE

502
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
WHO MAKE $250,000 OR WHATEVER,

503
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
IT'S ON THE OWNERS.

504
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
A LOT OF THEM TAKE THEIR INCOME

505
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
AND FILE IT BACK INTO THE

506
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
BUSINESS IN ORDER TO GET BIGGER.

507
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
IF THEIR TAX RATES ARE GOING UP

508
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
IS GOING TO HAVE A CHILLING

509
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
EFFECT ON WHETHER THEY HIRE OR

510
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
SPEND.

511
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES, 2% OF

512
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
PAYROLL TAX CUT WHICH HAS BEEN

513
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
IN EFFECT FOR TWO YEARS.

514
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
THAT IS GOING TO EFFECT A LOT OF

515
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
CUSTOMERS.
IT'S NOT JUST RICH PEOPLE.

516
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
IF YOU MAKE 40-60 K A YEAR YOU

517
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
ARE GOING TO LOSE $700 LESS THAT

518
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
YOU ARE GOING TO SPEND.

519
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
THEY SAY $95 BILLION BACK INTO

520
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
THE GOVERNMENT.

521
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
>> Gregg: THAT IS $95 BILLION

522
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
BACK INTO THE GOVERNMENT BUT

523
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
THAT MEANS $95 BILLION OUT OF

524
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
THE POCKETS OF CUSTOMERS TO

525
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
SPEND ON SMALL BUSINESSES?

526
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
>> THAT IS WHY IT'S NOT JUST A

527
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
TAX EFFECT ON SMALL BUSINESS

528
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
OWNERS BUT ON WHAT THEIR

529
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO DO.

530
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
WE'RE ALREADY SEEING A CUT BACK

531
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
BY OWNERS IN TERMS OF BUYING NEW

532
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
SOFTWARE OR EQUIPMENT SPENDING.

533
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
THERE HAS BEEN A DECLINE.

534
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
SO THAT IS NOW.

535
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
WITH THIS UNCERTAINTY MOVING

536
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
FORWARD YOU CAN ONLY EXPECT THEY

537
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
WOULD PULL BACK.

538
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
>> Gregg: MOST OF JOB CREATION

539
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
HAS COME FROM SMALL BUSINESSES.

540
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
DO YOU SEE THAT REVERSING ITSELF

541
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
IF THE PRESIDENT MAINTAINS HIS

542
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
POSITION ON TAXING THOSE MAKING

543
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
MORE THAN $250,000 A YEAR?

544
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
>> THE ISSUE IS THEY CREATE A --

545
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
THEY ARE BASICALLY THE ENGINE OF

546
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
JOB CREATION.

547
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
THEY EMPLOY ABOUT HALF OF THE

548
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
AMERICANS EMPLOYED RIGHT NOW.

549
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
WILL IT HAVE AN IMPACT ON

550
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
EMPLOYMENT RATE?

551
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I THINK IT HAS TO.

552
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
>> Gregg: EXPERTS SAY IF WE GO

553
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
OVER THE FISCAL CLIFF THERE WILL

554
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
BE RECESSION.

555
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
DO SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE THE

556
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
MOST TO LOSE?

557
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
>> THEY LIVE MONTH TO MONTH MUCH

558
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
MORE SO THAN HUGE CORPORATIONS

559
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000

WE NEED TO FOCUS ON FUNDAMENTALS

742
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
HAVING LOCK DOWN DRILLS AND

743
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
WORKING COOPERATEDIVELY WITH

744
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
POLICE THAT TAKE MORE TIME THAN

745
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
THEY DO MONEY.

746
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
>> Reporter: THERE HAS BEEN A

747
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
NUMBER OF CUTS IN SECURITY

748
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
BUDGETS IN FEDERAL AND LOCAL

LEVELS.

750
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
EXPERTS SAY WE MAY NEED MORE

751
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
MONEY FOR TWO-RAY RADIOS OR

752
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
EXTRA COUNSELORS MANY MEASURES

753
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
DO NOT REQUIRE MONEY, THEY

754
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
REQUIRE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT

755
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
PEOPLE ARE PREPARED.

756
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
GOOD EXAMPLE WOULD BE THAT MANY

757
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
SCHOOLS AND ADMINISTRATORS CAN

758
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
ORDER A LOCKDOWN.

759
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
THAT SHOULD CHANGE.

760
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
>> THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.

761
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
IF YOU ARE IN A SCHOOL WHERE

762
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
ONLY ADMINISTRATORS ARE ALLOWED

763
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
TO DO A LOCKDOWN.

764
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
WE NEED TO HAVE TRAINING TO

765
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
EMPOWER YOU AND TRAIN YOU ON HOW

766
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
TO DO ONE YOURSELF.

767
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
ANY ADULT IN THAT BUILDING THAT

768
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
SEES A DANGEROUS SITUATION

769
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
SHOULD BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT A

770
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
LIFE SAVING FUNCTION.

771
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
>> Reporter: AND ADULTS LIKE THE

772

SAFETY, PREVENTION AND CRISIS

775
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
PLANNING IS ALL PART OF THE

776
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
TRAINING AGENDA.

777
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
THEY WANT EVERYBODY TRAINED THAT

778
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
WORKS IN A SCHOOL.

779
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
OF COURSE, BRING IN PARENTS AS

780
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
WELL SO THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT

781
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE EVENT OF AN

782
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
ATTACK LIKE WE SAW IN

783
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
CONNECTICUT.
>> Heather: THAT MAKES SENSE.

784
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
THANK YOU DOMINIC.

785

FORTUNATELY FELLOW STUDENTS HELP

800
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE, WE'RE

801
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
GOING TO CONTINUE TO USE THAT.

802
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
HOPEFULLY WE NEVER HAVE TO DEAL

803
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
WITH THIS A SITUATION LIKE THIS

804
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
AGAIN.
ANY TIME WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

805
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
THE SAFETY OF OUR STUDENTS, THAT

806
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
IS OUR PRIORITY.

807
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
>> Gregg: SCHOOL OFFICIALS THEY

808
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
ARE ADDING EXTRA PATROLS TO KEEP

809
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
PEOPLE SAFE FOR THE NEXT FEW

810
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000

ASSAD.
THE NEW COALITION OF OPPOSITION

817
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
LEADERS WOULD HAVE TO BE

818
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
SUPPORTED IN THE EVENT THAT THE

819
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
ASSAD REGIME IS TOPPLED TO

820
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
PREVENT EXTREMISTS TO BE ABLE TO

821
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
TAKE CONTROL.

822
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
>> Gregg: ALSO NOW IN THE MIDDLE

823
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
EAST, SLUAYIST LEADERS IN EGYPT

824
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
CLAIM THEY HAVE A MAJORITY OF

825
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
VOTES IN THE FIRST ROUND OF

826
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
REFERENDUM IN A DRAFT

827
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
CONSTITUTION BUT ALLEGATIONS OF

828
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
WIDESPREAD FRAUD ARE CASTING A

829
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
SHADOW OVER THAT VOTE SETTING

830
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
THE STAGE FOR POSSIBLY MORE

831
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
VIOLENT PROTESTS.

832
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
GREG PALKOT IS STREAMING LIVE

835
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
CONTROVERSIAL CONSTITUTION WILL

6 THEIR WAY THE ELECTION IS THE

837
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
FIRST OF TWO ROUND.

838
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
WE'RE GETTING PRELIMINARY

839
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
RESULTS IN CAIRO AND ELSEWHERE,

840
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THE YES

841
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
VOTED, 57%, THE NO VOTE IS 43.

842
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
THE TURN OFF WAS DOWN BY

843
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
EGYPTIAN STANDARDS AND THEY ARE

844
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
REPORTING WIDESPREAD

845
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
IRREGULARITIES BUT THE

846
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO BE

847
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
DISMISSING THOSE CHARGES.

848
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
IT WAS MARRED BY THE VIOLENCE WE

849
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
HAVE SEEN HERE IN JIT FOR THE

850
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.

851
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
THE HEADQUARTERS OF A POLITICAL

852
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
PARTY ATTACKED BY THE ISLAMISTS,

853
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
THIS IS SOMETHING LIKE 120,000

854
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS MOBILIZED FOR

855
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
THE DAY.

856
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
IF THE PRO CONSTITUTION IS

857
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
FAVORED BY MORSI DEFENDERS ARE

858
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
SAYING THAT IT IS NEEDED TO

859
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
PROTECT THE GAINS OF THE

860
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
REVOLUTION.

861
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
NEXT SATURDAY SECOND AND FINAL

862
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
ROUND OF VOTING WILL BE IN RURAL

863
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
AREAS.

864
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
THESE AREAS ARE FRIENDLY TO THE

865
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
CONSERVATIVE ISLAMISTS.

866
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
SO IT SEEMS THAT THE

867
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
CONSTITUTION WILL GO THROUGH.

868
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
THERE IS A CANS THAT MODIFY IT

869
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
AFTER THE FACT.

870
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
THERE ARE ELECTIONS CALLED FOR A

871
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
NEW PARLIAMENT BUT AGAIN IT

872
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
APPEARS THAT THE ISLAMISTS WILL

873
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
REMAIN IN CHARGE.

874
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
AS YOU NOTED THAT COULD MEAN THE

875
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
THREAT OF VIOLENCE REMAINS AS

876
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
WELL AND THE CHALLENGE OF

OUR LEGAL PANEL WEIGHS IN WHAT

IF ANYTHING THE JUSTICE SYSTEM

887
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
CAN DO TO PREVENT TRAGEDIES LIKE

888
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
THE ONE IN NEWTOWN.

889
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
THE BOYS USE

It's not an upgrade
to your phone.

907

It's an upgrade to yourself.

LEARN FROM THIS TRAGEDY.

916
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
LET'S BRING IN OUR LEGAL PANEL.

917

HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT, FROM A

921
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
LEGAL STANDPOINT, YOU THINK

922
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
THERE CAN BE SOMETHING DONE IN

923
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH FIELD?

924
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000

945
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
IN SCHOOLS, WHEN WE GO TO WORK

946
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
IN A PEACEFUL WAY BECAUSE WE

947
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000

00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
WHAT AMERICANS NEED TO HEAR AND

1109
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
EXACTLY WHAT THAT MIGHT BE.

1110
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
JOINING ME IS TALK RADIO NEWS

1111
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
SERVICE, ELLEN RATNER AND MIKE

1112
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
SLATER.

1113
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

1114
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I'LL TOSS IT TO BOTH OF YOU.

1115
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THE PRESIDENT

1116
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
WILL SAY THIS EVENING?

1117
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
>> I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO EXPECT.

1118
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I THINK WE NEED TO HEAR A

1119
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
MESSAGE OF LOVE.
IT CAN START WITH OUR FAMILIES.

1120
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
THERE ARE 20 HOMES IN

1121
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
CONNECTICUT WITH EMPTY BEDS AND

1122
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
LONELY TOYS AND WRAPPED

1123
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
PRESENTS.

1124
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
THERE ARE 20 GRIEVING FAMILIES

1125
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
THAT WANT MORE THAN ANYTHING TO

1126
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
SEE THEIR KIDS FOR ONE MORE HUG

1127
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
AND SHOWER THEM WITH MORE LOVE.

1128
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I THINK THE MESSAGE OF

1129
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
ENCOURAGING MORE ACTIVE AND

1130
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
ENGAGED PARENTS ACROSS THE

1131
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
COUNTRY.

1132
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
THAT IS THE MESSAGE WE NEED TO

1133
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
HEAR THAT ALL THE TIME.

1134
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
>> Heather: THEY'LL BE TWO

1135
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
GROUPS OF PEOPLE HE WILL BE

1136
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
SPEAKING TO, PRIVATELY HE WILL

1137
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
SPEAK TO THE VICTIMS AND

1138
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
FAMILIES BUT WHEN THEY LISTEN TO

1139
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
HIM WHEN HE SPEAKS TO THE

1140
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
COUNTRY THEY WILL BE LISTENING

1141
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
TO SOMETHING, THE REST OF US

1142
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
WILL BE LISTENING TO SOMETHING.

1143
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
WHAT DOES HE NEED TO DO?

1144
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
>> IN M RESPECTS HE SHOULDN'T

1145
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
EVEN SPEAK.

1146
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I THINK HE SHOULD BE THERE AND

1147
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
NOT NECESSARILY TALK.

1148
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
IT'S TRUE THAT THE REST OF THE

1149
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
COUNTRY IS WAITING FOR HIM TO

1150
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
TALK.
OBVIOUSLY HIS EXPERIENCE AS A

1151
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
PARENT IS VERY IMPORTANT.

1152
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
JUST LIKE YOU SAID, THE ISSUE OF

1153
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
ONE LAST HUG, BUT ALSO HE MADE A

1154
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
SPEECH ON 9/11 THAT I THOUGHT

1155
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
WAS AMAZING ON TENTH

1156
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
ANNIVERSARY.
HE SAID IT IS WORTH REMEMBERING

1157
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
WHAT HASN'T CHANGED, OUR

1158
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
CHARACTER AS A NATION AND FAITH

1159
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
IN GOD HASN'T CHANGED.

1160
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
WITH GOD AS OUR GUIDE LET'S

1161
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
HONOR THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN LOST

1162
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
AND LET'S LOOK TO THE FUTURE

1163
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
WITH HEARTS OF HOPE.

1164
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
IF HE SAYS SOMETHING ALONG THOSE

1165
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
LINES THAT WILL BE VERY

1166
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
POIGNANT.
>> Heather: HE CAME OUT ON

1167
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
FRIDAY AND HIS FIRST COMMENT, HE

1168
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
SHED A FEW TEARS, DO YOU EXPECT

1169
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
TO SEE THAT TYPE OF EMOTION FROM

1170
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
HIM SPEAKING NOT JUST AS A

1171
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
PRESIDENT BUT ALSO AS FATHER

1172
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
THIS TIME AROUND?

1173
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
>> I HOPE SO.

1174
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I HOPE HE CONNECTS AS A DAD

1175
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
FIRST AND POLITICS NEVER.

1176
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
THE IDEA THERE IS NO SUCH THING

1177
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
AS DARKNESS, WE CALL THE ABSENCE

1178
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
OF LIGHT.

1179
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I'M INSPIRED BY ONE OF TEACHERS

1180
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
PUT ALL THE KIDS IN THE

1181
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
CLASSROOM AND TELLING THEM, I

1182
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH.

1183
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
HE DIDN'T WANT THE LAST THING

1184
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
FOR THEM TO HEAR IS GUNFIRE.

1185
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
SO IN THE FACE OF THIS DARKNESS,

1186
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
SHE WANTED TO PROVIDE A RAY OF

1187
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
LIGHT AND TO PROVIDE COMFORT AND

1188
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
HOPE FOR THESE KIDS.

1189
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
SHE WAS ABLE TO DO THAT.

1190
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I SAY THAT BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE

1191
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A RAY OF

1192
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
LIGHT TO SOMEONE.

1193
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
EVERYONE IS DEALING WITH SOME

1194
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
DARKNESS OR LONELINESS OR SOME

1195
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
DOUBT.
WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE AN

1196
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
ELEMENT OF KINDNESS AND

1197
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
ENCOURAGEMENT TO PEOPLE.

1198
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
LET'S NOT FORGET WE ALL HAVE THE

1199
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT WITH THE

1200
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
PEOPLE IN OUR CIRCLE AS WELL.

1201
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
>> Heather: I HEARD THIS TOSSED

1202
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
AROUND A LOT, A DESCRIPTION OF

1203
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
NOT BEING THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF

1204
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
BUT TAKING THE ROLL ON AS THE

1205
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
COMFORTER IN CHIEF.

1206
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
DO YOU THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE

1207
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
FIRST PRIORITY?

1208
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
>> HE HAS DONE THAT.

1209
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
THAT IS WHY I SAID I'M NOT SURE

1210
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
WORDS ARE IMPORTANT OR HE SHOULD

1211
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
EVEN SPEAK.

1212
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THE PRESIDENT

1213
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
IS THERE AND HE CAN REACH OUT TO

1214
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
PEOPLE AND COMFORT THEM AND BE

1215
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
THERE.

1216
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
HE LISTENS TO THEM THAT HE HEARS

1217
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
THEM, THAT IS WHAT I THINK WE

1218
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
WANTED TO SEE FOR OURSELVES.

1219
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
>> Heather: WHAT ABOUT LESSONS

1220
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
HE CAN SHARE FROM THIS TRAGEDY

1221
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
AND SINCE HIS TIME IN THE OVAL

1222
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
OFFICE?
>> I THINK THAT IS VERY

1223
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
DIFFICULT.

1224
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I'M NOT SURE THAT THOSE KINDS OF

1225
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
LESSONS.

1226
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
HE IS NOT A PREACHER, HE IS THE

1227
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
PRESIDENT FOR HIM TO BE TALKING

1228
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
ABOUT.

1229
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
HE IS THE PERSON THAT IS THERE

1230
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
COMFORTING AND REPRESENTING THE

1231
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
NATION IN HIS EFFORT.

1232
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
>> WELL SAID.

1233
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
ON THAT POINT, I'M A LITTLE

1234
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA OF

1235
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
PRESIDENT BEING THE MORAL LEADER

1236
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
OF OUR NATION.

1237
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I THINK FATHERS AND MOTHERS ARE

1238
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
MORAL LEADERS OF THEIR HOMES.

1239
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
SO LET'S NOT JUST OUTSOURCE ALL

1240
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR

1241
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
FAMILIES BY LOOKING TO THE

1242
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
PRESIDENT TO SOLVE ALL OF OUR

1243
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
PROBLEMS.
THIS IN PARTICULAR, LET'S TAKE

1244
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
THIS UPON OURSELVES TO LEAD OUR

1245
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
FAMILIES IN A BETTER PLACE.

1246
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
>> Heather: THANK YOU ELLEN AND

1247
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
MIKE.
>> Gregg: COMING UP, WE'LL HAVE

1248
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
MORE ON THE PRESIDENT'S UP

1249
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
COMING VISIT TO CONNECTICUT.

1250
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
HE IS ALREADY THERE AS HE

1251
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
PREPARES TO MEET THE VICTIMS'

1252
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
FAMILIES BEFORE ATTENDING AN

1253
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
INTERFAITH MEMORIAL SERVICE TO

1254
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
REMEMBER THE LIVES YOUNG AND

1255
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
OLDER, THOSE WHO WERE LOST IN

1256
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
THE TRAGEDY IN NEWTOWN.

1257
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1258
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,000
:

1259
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
EAT GOOD FATS.

1260
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
:
AVOID BAD.

1261
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
DON'T GO OVER 2000...

1262
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
1200 CALORIES A DAY.

1263
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
CARBS ARE BAD. CARBS ARE GOOD.

1264
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
THE STORY KEEPS CHANGING.

1265
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
SO I'M NOT LISTENING...

1266
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
TO ANYONE BUT MYSELF.

1267
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I KNOW BETTER NUTRITION
WHEN I SEE IT:

1268
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000

SEE THE SEAM?

1271
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
MORE PROCESSED FLAKES LOOK
NOTHING LIKE NATURALRAINS.

1272
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH
NUTRITION YOU CAN SEE.

1273
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
GREAT GRAINS.

1274
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
SEARCH GREAT GRAINS
AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.

1275
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000

MY NEXT GUEST HAS BEEN A FORMER

1645
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
F.B.I. PROFILER AND AUTHOR OF

1646
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
"DANGEROUS INSTINCTS."

1647
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD

1648
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
SO FAR, BY WHAT WE KNOW, DO YOU

1649
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
THINK THAT WE ARE IN I CLOSER TO

1650
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
KNOWING WHY?

1651
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
>>Guest: WELL, WE ARE GETTING

1652
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
CLOSER TO KNOWING WHY.

1653
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I THINK THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

1654
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
FOLKS THAT ARE CONDUCTING THE

1655
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
INVESTIGATION ARE BEING

1656
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
PARTICULARLY CAREFUL, TO BE

1657
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
EXACT AND PRECISE ABOUT THE

1658
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
INFORMATION THEY PROVIDE ONCE

1659
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
THEY COMPLETE THE INVESTIGATION

1660
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT PEOPLE

1661
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
ARE EMOTIONAL AND ANGRY SO LAW

1662
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
ENFORCEMENT WILL BE VERY CAREFUL

1663
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
IT IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY AND

1664
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
ACCURATE SO PEOPLE WILL HAVE THE

1665
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
BACKGROUND AND THE UNDERSTANDING

1666
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

1667
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
>>Heather: LET'S TALK ABOUT

1668
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
THE LATEST INFORMATION THAT HAS

1669
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
COME OUT TODAY.

1670
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
MIKE REPORTED REGARDING THE

1671
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
AMOUNT OF THE WEAPONS USED, AN

1672
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
ASSAULT RIFLE, A SHOTGUN IN THE

1673
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
CAR, TWO HANDGUNS, HUNDREDS OF

1674
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION, AND

1675
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION,

1676
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
DOES THAT TELL YOU ANYTHING?

1677
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
>>Guest: IT SAYS, AGAIN, THE

1678
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
GUNMAN CAME THERE WITH THE

1679
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
INTENTION TO KILL AT MANY PEOPLE

1680
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
AS HE COULD CULL AND HE WAS

1681
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
EQUIPPED TO DO THAT AND HE

1682
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
BROUGHT WEAPONS THAT WOULD

1683
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
GUARANTEE THAT.

1684
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
HE DID NOT BRING A BOW AND ARROW

1685
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
OR A SLINGSHOT.

1686
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
HE BROUGHT WEAPONS OF MASS

1687
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
DESTRUCTION.

1688
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
THAT IS WHAT HE INTENDED TO DO.

1689
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
BY USING MULTIPLE WEAPONS RATHER

1690
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
THAN A SINGLE WEAPON, YOU

1691
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
GUARANTEE YOURSELF THAT YOU ARE

1692
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL.

1693
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
>>Heather: AN ASSAULT RIFLE

1694
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,000
AGAINST SIX AND SEVEN-YEAR-OLD

1695
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
INNOCENT CHILDREN.
WHAT ABOUT THE VICTIMS HE

1696
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
PICKED.
DO YOU HAVE ANY ANSWERS?

1697
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
>>Guest: THE CHOICE OF THE

1698
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
VICTIMS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

1699
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
THOSE VICTIMS ARE VERY

1700
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
VULNERABLE.

1701
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
THEY ARE HELPLESS INDIVIDUALS.

1702
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
THEY SMALL CHILDREN.

1703
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND

1704
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
TO A SITUATION LIKE THAT.

1705
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
IN MY OPINION, WHEN YOU CHOOSE

1706
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
VICTIMS WHO ARE LIKE THAT, YOU

1707
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
VERY MUCH GUARANTEE YOU ARE

1708
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
GOING TO GET NOTORIETY AND YOU

1709
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
WILL STOP THE WORLD FOR A PERIOD

1710
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
OF TIME.

1711
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
IF THAT WAS HIS INTENTION HE DID

1712
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
THAT BUT TO BE ABLE TO CARRY

1713
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
THAT OUT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

1714
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
DEHUMANIZE PEOPLE OR TO TURN

1715
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
THEM INTO OBJECTS.

1716
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
>>Heather: WE DISCOVERED ALSO

1717
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
HE SHOT HIS MOTHER FIRST.

1718
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
SHE WAS STILL IN HER PAJAMAS, IN

1719
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
BED, SHOT HER REPEATEDLY

1720
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
MULTIPLE TIME IN THE HEAD AND

1721
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
GOT IN HER CAR AND DROVE TO THE

1722
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
SCHOOL.

1723
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
DO YOU BELIEVE, ALTHOUGH

1724
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
INITIALLY IT WAS REPORTED SHE

1725
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
WAS AT SCHOOL, THAT IS THOUGHT

1726
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
TRUE, SHE WAS NOT A TEACHER, IS

1727
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
THERE A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE

1728
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
TWO?

1729
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
>>Guest: THAT WOULD MAKE THE

1730
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
MOST SENSE TO ME THIS IS A

1731
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO.

1732
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
BUT SAY THERE ISN'T A CONNECTION

1733
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
BETWEEN THE TWO.

1734
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
JUST THE CHOICE OF SELECTING

1735
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
SMALL CHILDREN BECOMES REALLY

1736
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
IMPORTANT TO WHAT HE WANTED TO

1737
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
ACCOMPLISH WHICH DID REQUIRE

1738
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
INCREDIBLE ANGER AND INCREDIBLE

1739
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
SENSE OF REVENGE AND A NEED TO

1740
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
RETALIATE.

1741
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
THAT INFORMATION WILL COME OUT

1742
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
AS THE INVESTIGATION UNFOLDS.

1743
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
TO TARGET THAT KIND OF A VICTIM

1744
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
REQUIRES INTENSE ANGER TOWARD

1745
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE THE

1746
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
CAPABILITY OF HAVING HURT YOU AT

1747
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
ANY POINT IN THE PAST.

1748
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
>>Heather: SOMETHING ELSE

1749
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
INTERESTING ABOUT THE KILLER, HE

1750
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
WAS 20 YEARS OLD AND IN THIS DAY

1751
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
AND AGE 20-YEAR-OLDS USUALLY

1752
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
HAVE AN EXTENSIVE DIGITAL

1753
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
FOOTPRINT BUT HE DID NOT HAVE

1754
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
FACEBOOK PAGE.

1755
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

1756
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
>>Guest: WELL, IN THE LAST

1757
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
COUPLE OF CASES THAT WAS, IN

1758
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
FACT, TRUE.

1759
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
HIS INTERESTS MAY HAVE BEEN

1760
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
FOCUSED ON SOMETHING ELSE.

1761
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
WE HAVE PRECONCEIVED IDEAS THIS

1762
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
IS WHAT IS TYPICAL IF A

1763
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
20-YEAR-OLD AND WE MAY BE RIGHT

1764
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
BUT WE CANNOT BE SURPRISED WHEN

1765
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,000
WE SEE ATYPICAL BEHAVIOR BECAUSE

1766
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
THE SHOOTERS DO NOT COME FROM

1767
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,000
THE SAME PATTERN, AND ARE AN

1768
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
ANOMALY.
WE DO HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT WE

1769
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
ARE GOING TO SEE DISTINCT

1770
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
DIFFERENCES AND DISTINCT

1771
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
PATTERNS.
>>Heather: IS THERE ANYTHING

1772
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO

1773
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
PREVENT THIS?

1774
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
>>Guest: WELL, I HAVE BEEN

1775
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
TALKING ABOUT THERE AND I HAVE

1776
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
HEARD OTHER FOLKS TALK ABOUT IT.

1777
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:30,000
THIS IS NOT SNAP BEHAVIOR, IT

1778
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
WAS NOT AN IMPULSIVE ACT.

1779
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
IT TOOK TIME TO GET THE GUNS.

1780
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
IT TOOK TIME TO GET THE

1781
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
AMMUNITION.

1782
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
DURING THAT TIME, THE SHOOTER'S

1783
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
BEHAVIOR WOULD HAVE BECOME EVEN

1784
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
MORE DANGEROUS AND MORE ERRATIC

1785
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
AND HIS CIRCLE WAS SMALL AND

1786
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
THOSE CLOSE TO HIM WOULD HAVE

1787
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
NOTICEED SOMETHING AS HE BEGAN

1788
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
TO GET WORSE AND WORSE.

1789
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
>>Heather: THANK YOU VERY MUCH

1790
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
FOR THIS VERY GOOD INSIGHT.

1791
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000

1802
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000

TAKE PLACE.

1822
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
OBVIOUSLY, IT IS AN EMOTIONAL

1823
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
NIGHT.
A SOMBER SET AND IT HAS BEEN

1824
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000

SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR THAT

1893
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:51,000
PLACE TO GET BEYOND ANYTHING.

01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
>>Heather: I KNOW AS A DAD YOU

01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000

DEADLY BENGHAZI TERRORIST ACT

1909
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000

PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I FELL OUT

SENSE, THAT WAS THE END.

1926
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTOOD HE

1927
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
COULD NOT GO FORWARD WITH HER

1928
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
AFTER THAT.

1929
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,000
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

1930
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
>> THIS WAS A PIECE IN THE "WALL

1931
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
STREET JOURNAL" AND THAT

1932
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000

01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,000
WHO IS IS A FORMER CLIENT OF HE.

1938
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OUT OF

1939
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
OFFICE AND SHOULD NOT BE AT THE

01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000

HEARINGS THIS WEEK ON BENGHAZI

1949
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
CHAIRED BY JOHN KERRY.

1950
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
AND THE MAIN WITNESS WAS GOING

1951
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
TO BE HILLARY CLINTON.

1952
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
SINCE THIS WAS ANNOUNCED WE KNOW

1953
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
THAT JOHN KERRY IS GOING TO BE

1954
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
THE NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE.

1955

1958
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
STOMACH BUG AND SHE CANNOT

1959
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
TESTIFY, SHE HAD A CONCUSSION.

1960
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:47,000
>>Gregg: SO WE WILL NEVER

01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
HEAR?

1962
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
HE WILL BE CONFIRMED EASILY?

1963
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
>> HE MADE THE RIGHT CALL FOR

1964
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
JOHN McCAIN IN 2004 ASKING HIM

1965
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:02,000
TO BE THE RUNNING MATE AND CHUCK

1966
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
HAGEL SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WHO

OPPOSED SANCTIONS ON IRAN, HE

1968
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
OBJECTED AND HE IS CONSIDERED,

1969
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
AS YOU KNOW, IN ISRAEL, TO BE

1970
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
VERY ANTIISRAEL AND HE IS

1971
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,000
AGAINST ALL INTERVENTIONS.

1972
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
WE WILL HAVE A POLITICAL

1973
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
SECRETARY WHO WILL GET COVER AS

1974
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
HE CONTINUES A FOREIGN POLICY

1975
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
THAT MANY AMERICANS OBJECT TO.

1976
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
>> HE WANTED A REPUBLICAN TO

1977
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
LEAD THAT CHARGE.

1978
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
>> YOU NEED A CHAIN SAW.

1979
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
>> THE FISCAL CLIFF, WE WILL

1980
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
TALK ABOUT THAT.

1981
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
ON FRIDAY, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

1982
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
HAPPENED YESTERDAY BUT SPEAKER

1983
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
PER IS OFFERING TO RAISE TAX

1984
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
RATES ON INCOME ABOVE $1 MILLION

1985
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,000
AND OBAMA IS HOLDING FIRM AT

1986
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
$250,000.

1987
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
>> THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT, THE BEGINNING OF

1988
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
THE REPUBLICAN CAVE.

1989
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
WHETHER THEY WILL CAVE ENOUGH TO

1990
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
GET A DEAL BEFORE DECEMBER 31,

1991
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
WE DON'T KNOW.

1992
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:18,000
THIS IS UNILATERAL SURRENDER.

1993
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
>> OBAMA WANTS MORE TAX

1994
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
INCREASES THAN CUTS BUT MEMBERS

1995
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
ARE THE OPPOSITE.

1996
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
THIS IS THE FOX NEWS POLL, WHICH

1997
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
IS THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH THE

1998
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
COUNTRY'S BUDGET PROBLEM, AND 57

SPENDING.

2002

20 PERCENT SAY TAX INCREASES.

2003
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
>> IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN.

2004
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
IF ALL WE GET ARE HUGE TAX

20 MILLION MEN ALREADY HAVE.

2297

ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOUR HEART
IS HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR SEX.

2298
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
DO NOT TAKE VIAGRA IF YOU TAKE
NITRATES FOR CHEST PAIN;

2299
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
IT MAY CAUSE AN UNSAFE DROP
IN BLOOD PRESSURE.

FOR AN ERECTION
LASTING MORE THAN FOUR HOURS.

2304
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
STOP TAKING VIAGRA
AND CALL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY

IF YOU EXPERIENCE
A SUDDEN DECREASE OR LOSS

But when I was in an accident...

2311
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
I was worried the
health care system

2312
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
spoke a language all its own

2313
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,000
With UnitedHealthcare,
I got help that fit my life.

2314

morning because my back
hurt so bad.

The Sleep Number bed
conforms to you.

2462
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I wake up in the morning
with no back pain.

2463
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
I can adjust it if I need
to...if my back's a little

2464
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
more sore.

2465
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000

in the morning, I feel great!

solution.

secret is it's air

2470
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:50,000
chambers which provide
ideal support and put you

01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
in control of the
firmness.

2472
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,000
And the bed is perfect for
couples because each side

2473
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,000
adjusts independently to
their unique Sleep Number.
