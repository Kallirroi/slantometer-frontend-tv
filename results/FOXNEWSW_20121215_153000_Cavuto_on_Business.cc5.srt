1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
HOW BAD IT WAS AND PROBABLY

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
SOME EXPLANATION THAT LIES IN

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
WHATEVER ANGER HE HAD TOWARD

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
HIS MOTHER OR THE SCHOOL,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
WHATEVER, THE PROBLEM WITH

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
THAT EXPLANATION, IT'S NOT

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
GOING TO EXPLAIN WHY ALL THESE

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
CHILDREN HAD TO BE KILLED AND

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
ANY MORE THAN THERE'S AN

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
EXPLANATION FOR SEPTEMBER

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
11TH, BUT IT DOESN'T EXPLAIN

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
WHY THE POOR GUY DELIVERING

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
BAGELS THAT DAY GOT KILLED FOR

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
WHATEVER THE CRAZY CAUSE WAS.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
>> AND THE SAME WAY, THAT WAS

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
EXACTLY MY THOUGHT.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
IT WAS SO UNFATHOMABLE ON THAT

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
DAY THAT SO MUCH HATRED COULD

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
DRIVE MEN TO HIJACK PLANES AND

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
DRIVE THEM INTO THE PENTAGON

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
AND SHANKSVILLE--

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
>> THERE'S A LOT TO THIS, JON.

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I WAS WATCHING FOX EARLIER AND

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
HEARD GOVERNOR HUCKABEE TALK

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
ABOUT EVIL AND THE FACT THAT

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
SOMETIMES WE CAN'T CONFRONT

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
THE FACT, THERE'S JUST EVIL IN

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
THE WORLD.

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
WELL, THERE IS.

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE

31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
ALSO MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
CATEGORIES YOU CAN PUT THIS

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
INTO THAT THE FINAL RESULT IS

34
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS WELL

35
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
ENOUGH AND ANYBODY OFFERING

36
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
SIMPLE SOLUTIONS TO SOMETHING

37
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
LIKE THIS IS OFFERING NO

38
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
SOLUTION.
THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE THING, IT

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
DOESN'T HAVE A SIMPLE

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
SOLUTION.
A LOT OF THINGS HAVE TO BE

41
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
LOOKED AT AS WE MOVE THROUGH

42
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
THIS BECAUSE WE'RE JUST NOT

43
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
GOOD AT PREDICTING THIS KIND

44
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
OF BEHAVIOR.

45
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT YET.

46
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
>> AT THE SAME TIME, THE WHOLE

47
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
NATION WANTS TO WRAP THIS

48
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
COMMUNITY IN A BIG HUG AND

49
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
JUST EMBRACE IT.

50
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
>> BECAUSE THE WHOLE NATION

51
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
REALIZES IT CAN HAPPEN TO

52
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
THEM.   IT COULD HAPPEN TO

53
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
NEWTON--

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, AN

55
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
IDYLLIC COMMUNITY, IT CAN

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
HAPPEN ANYWHERE IN THIS

57
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
COUNTRY.
IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING TO

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
HAPPEN, DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A

59
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
PREVALENT CRIME, IT ISN'T.

60
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
THIS IS NOT THE WAY MOST

61
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
CHILDREN, GOD FORBID ARE GOING

62
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
TO BE HURT OR INJURED.

63
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
OTHER WAYS TO GET HURT OR

64
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
INJURED AND WE HAVE TO PAY

65
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
ATTENTION TO.

66
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
THIS IS SO HORRIFIC AND SO

67
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
ARBITRARY IT COULD HAPPEN TO

68
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
ANY ONE OF US AND ALL OF US

69
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
HAVE THIS NIGHTMARE ABOUT OUR

70
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
CHILDREN AND THAT'S WHY I

71
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
THINK THIS WHOLE COUNTRY IS

72
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
TOGETHER ON THIS.

73
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
>> AND CERTAINLY THOSE PARENTS

74
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
ARE GOING TO BE SECOND

75
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
GUESSING LOTS OF DECISIONS.

76
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE, YOU KNOW.

77
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
>> AND THAT'S BEING A FATHER

78
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
AND I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW YOU --

79
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I COULDN'T IMAGINE IT DURING

80
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
SEPTEMBER 11TH OR MANY OTHER

81
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
TIMES HOW YOU LIVE WITH IN,

82
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
HORRIBLE.
>> THOSE ANSWERS ARE YET TO

83
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
COME IN THE DAYS AHEAD.

84
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE OUR

85
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
CONVERSATION WITH MAYOR

86
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
GUILIANI IN JUST A BIT AND

87
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
CONTINUING COVERAGE OF THE

88
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
AFTERMATH OF THE TRAGEDY IN

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT JUST

90
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
AHEAD.

91
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
GET MARRIED,
HAVE A COUPLE OF KIDS,

92
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
[ children laughing ]
MOVE TO THE COUNTRY,

93
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
AND LIVE A LONG, HAPPY LIFE
TOGETHER

94
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
WHERE THEY ALMOST NEVER FIGHT
ABOUT MONEY.

95
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
[ dog barks ]
BECAUSE RIGHT AFTER
THEY GET MARRIED,

96
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THEY'LL FIND
SOME RETIREMENT PEOPLE

97
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
WHO ARE PAID ON SALARY,
NOT COMMISSION.

98
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
THEY'LL GET
STRAIGHTFORWARD GUIDANCE

99
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
AND BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON OTHER
THINGS, LIKE EACH OTHER,

100
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
WHICH ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

101
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.

102
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
FROM TD AMERITRADE.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
SATURDAY OF THE MURDERS THAT

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
HAPPENED IN NEWTOWN,

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
CONNECTICUT.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
NEWTOWN, 60 MILES FROM NEW

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
YORK CITY, A COMMUTER TOWN IN

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
MANY WAYS, TO THE BIG CITY OF

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
MANHATTAN, BUT A COMMUNITY ALL

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
ITS OWN, A SMALL COMMUNITY

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
THAT MANY OF US PROBABLY

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
DIDN'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
YESTERDAY UNTIL WE GOT THE

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
NEWS OF THE SHOOTING AND

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AT SANDY

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
AT THIS POINT WE PROBABLY ALL
FEEL A LITTLE BIT CONNECTED TO

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THIS COMMUNITY.

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
YESTERDAY AND THE PRESIDENT

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
GETTING VERY EMOTIONAL WHILE

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
MAKING A STATEMENT AT THE

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
WHITE HOUSE SAYING WE'VE

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
ENDURED TOO MANY OF THESE

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
INCIDENTS OVER THE LAST FEW

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
YEARS AND EVERY TIME HE LEARNS

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
THE NEWS HE REACTS NOT AS A

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
PRESIDENT, BUT AS A PARENT.

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
LET'S LISTEN TO THE PRESIDENT.

134
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
>> I KNOW THERE'S NOT A PARENT

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
IN AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
THE SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
THAT I DO.
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN, BEAUTIFUL

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN THE AGES

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
AND FIVE AND TEN YEARS OLD.

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF GONE, AMONG

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
THE FALLEN WERE TEACHERS, MEN

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
AND WOMEN WHO DEVOTED THEIR

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
LIVES HELPING HOUR CHILDREN

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
FULFILL THEIR DREAMS, SO, OUR

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY.

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000

GRANDPARENTS, SISTERS AND

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
CHILDREN, AND FOR THE FAMILIES

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
OF THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST.

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
>> THE PRESIDENT EMOTIONAL

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
SHOOTING.
THE PRESIDENT'S WEEKLY MEDIA

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
MESSAGE TODAY ALSO TOUCHING ON

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
THE SCHOOL MASSACRE AND THE

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
PRESIDENT SAYS THE COUNTRIES

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
HAS A HEART HEAVY WITH HURT

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
AND REPUBLICANS CANCELED THE

163
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
WEEKLY ADDRESS SAYING THEY

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
WANTED THE PRESIDENT TO SPEAK

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
FOR THE THE ENTIRE NATION AT

166
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
THIS TIME OF MOURNING.

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
JON?

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
>> WE JUST GOT A NOD OF ASCENT

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
FROM FORMER NEW YORK CITY

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
MAYOR RUDY GUILIANI.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
>> ABSOLUTELY, I THINK THE

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
PRESIDENT SAID IT JUST

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
PERFECTLY AND MY HEART GOES

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
OUT TO HIM, NOW, I REMEMBER

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
SEPTEMBER 11TH RIGHT
AFTERWARDS HAVING TO DO TWO OR

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
THREE PRESS CONFERENCES AND

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
HARDEST THING TO DO WAS NOT TO

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
CRY AND I FOUND OUT THAT ONE

180
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
OF MY FRIEND'S WIFE HAD DIED

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
AND I ACTUALLY STOOD BEHIND

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
SOMEBODY SO NOBODY WOULD SEE

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
ME CRYING, BUT IT'S VERY, VERY

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
HARD TO NOT FEEL THE EMOTION

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS, ALL OF

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
US BEING PARENTS AND EVEN ONES

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
THAT AREN'T PARENTS, THEY'RE

188
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
AUNTS OR UNCLES, THEY

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
UNDERSTAND CHILDREN AND

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO

191
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
HAVE THE INNOCENT LITTLE

192
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
CHILDREN JUST MOWED DOWN IN AN

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
ABSOLUTELY INCOMPREHENSIBLE

194
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
FACT AND HOW DOES SOMEBODY

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
STAND IN FRONT OF A CLASSROOM

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
AND KILL A FIVE OR

197
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
SIX-YEAR-OLD.
IT COMPLETELY IS IMPOSSIBLE

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
FOR ANY VAGUELY NORMAL PERSON

199
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

200
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
>> AND THIS SCHOOL APPARENTLY

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
HAD DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT.

202
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
AISLE, YOU CANNOT, YOU

203
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
CANNOT--

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
EVEN IF THEY HAD TURNED THE

205
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
SCHOOL INTO A FORTRESS AND HAD

206
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
THE SCHOOLS LOCKED.

207
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
>> IN A COMMUNITY LIKE THAT,

208
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
THEY DID MORE IN A COMMUNITY

209
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
LIKE THAT THAN YOU WOULD

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
GENERALLY DO.

211
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
THIS IS A COMMUNITY WITH ONE

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
VIOLENT CRIME.
THIS ISN'T EVEN A DANGEROUS A

213
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
SUBURBAN OR URBAN AREA AND

214
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
THEY HAD MORE SECURITY THAN

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
ANY FACTS WOULD SUGGEST.

216
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
THE GUY BASICALLY SOUNDS LIKE

217
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
SHOT HIS WAY IN.

218
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
YOU COULD SAY, WELL, SHOULD

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THEY HAVE HAD AN ARMED POLICE

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
OFFICER THERE?

221
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
NOTHING IN THE PAST SUGGESTED

222
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
THEY HAVE AN ARMED POLICE

223
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
OFFICER THERE.
HAVING AN ARMED POLICE OFFICER

224
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
IN THE SCHOOL IS SOMEWHAT

225
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
DISCONCERTING FOR THE CHILDREN

226
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
AND WHO IS TO SAY HE WOULDN'T

227
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
HAVE SHOT THE ARMED POLICE

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
OFFICER.

229
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
HE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
SHOOTING THE PRINCIPAL.

231
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
THIS KID LOOKS TWO THINGS

232
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
ABOUT HIM, LOOKS LIKE HE KNEW

233
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
HOW TO SHOOT, AND VERY GOOD

234
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
SHOOTING, HORRIFIC SHOOTING,

235
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
BUT GOOD SHOOTING IN A VERY

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND LOOKS

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
LIKE HE WAS JUST, VERY

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
DISTURBED, A SMART KID, A KID

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
WHO HAD AN INTELLECT.

240
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
>> THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY SAID.
>> THAT'S A DANGEROUS KILLER.

241
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
>> HE WAS ALSO DESCRIBED AS A

242
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
GAMER.

243
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
>> DANGEROUS--

244

VIDEO GAMES WHICH CAN BE

246
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
HORRIFICALLY VIOLENT AND I

247
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
THINK AS MUCH AS ANYTHING--

248

>> THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS

249
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
KILLER WHEN YOU PUT ALL OF

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
THOSE ELEMENTS TOGETHER.

THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THIS.

256
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
THE ONLY THING IS, I URGE

257
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
DON'T FOCUS ON A SIMPLISTIC

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000

259
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
SIMPLISTIC PROBLEM, NOT SOLVED

Sometimelike the flu.fer from

348
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
With aches, fever and chills-
the flu's a really big deal.

349
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So why treat it like
it's a little cold?

350
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There's something
that works differently

351
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
than over-the-counter
remedies.

352
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Prescription TAMIFLU attacks
the flu virus at its source.

353
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So don't wait. Call your
doctor right away.

354
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
TAMIFLU is prescription
medicine for treating the flu

355
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
in adults and children
one year and older

356
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
whose flu symptoms started
within the last two days.

357
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Before taking TAMIFLU tell your
doctor if you're pregnant,

358
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
nursing. have serious
health conditions,

359
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
or take other medicines.

360
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If you develop an allergic
reaction, a severe rash,

361
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
or signs of unusual behavior,

362
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
stop taking TAMIFLU and call
your doctor immediately.

363
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Children and adolescents in
particular may be at an

364
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
increased risk
of seizures, confusion

365
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
or abnormal behavior.

366
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The most common
side effects are

367
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
mild to moderate nausea
and vomiting.

368
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The flu comes on fast,

369
