THE AGES BETWEEN 5 AND 10.

648
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
THERE ARE MANY MORE QUESTIONS

649
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
BUT THE MOST COMMON ONE IS WHY?

650
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
>> IN THESE TIMES OF TROUBLES

651
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000

PUZZLE.

663
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
WE HAVE TO PUT THE PIECES

664
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
TOGETHER TO TRY TO DRAW A

665
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000

OCCURRED.

ADAM LANZA IDENTIFIED AS THE

668
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
SHOOTER.
HE HAD NO KNOWN CRIMINAL RECORD

669
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000

HE WAS FOUND DEAD IN A CLASSROOM

673
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
BY HIS OWN HAND.

674

A FORMER CLASSMATE DESCRIBED HIM

675
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
AS QUIET.

676
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
>> HE WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT

677
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
DIFFERENT.

678
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
HE MOSTLY STUCK TO HIMSELF.

679
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SAY

680
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
THAT YOU COULD HAVE PREDICTED

681
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000

701
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000

00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
STUDENTS INTO A TINY BATHROOM.

738
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
A QUICK THINKING FRANTIC EFFORT

739
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
TO SAVE THEIR YOUNG LIVES.

740
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
LISTENED TO WHAT HAPPENED.

741
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
>> ONE OF MY STUDENTS ON TOP OF

742
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
THE TOILET.

743
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I KNEW WE HAD TO GET IN THERE.

744
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I TOLD THEM IT'S GOING TO BE

745
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
OKAY.
YOU ARE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

746
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I PULLED A BOOK SHELF BEFORE I

747
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
CLOSED THE DOOR IN FRONT OF IT.

748
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
WE WERE COMPLETELY BARRICADED

749
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
IN.
I WAS SO AFRAID IF HE DID COME

750
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
IN HE WOULD HEAR US AND HE WOULD

751
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
JUST START SHOOTING THE DOOR.

752
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I SAID WE HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTELY

753
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
QUIET AND WE HAVE -- I SAID

754
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
THERE ARE BAD GUYS OUT THERE NOW

755
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
WE NEED TO WAIT FOR THE GOOD

756
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
GUYS.
I AM HEARING THE GUN FIRE IN THE

757
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
HALL WAY I AM THINKING IN MY

758
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
MIND, I AM THE FIRST CLASSROOM

759
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
WHY ISN'T HE COMING?

760
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I AM THINKING WE ARE NEXT.

761
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
IN MY MIND I AM THINKING AS A

762
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
6-YEAR-OLD, 7-YEAR-OLD WHAT ARE

763
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
YOUR THOUGHTS?

764
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I AM THINKING THAT I HAVE TO

765
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
ALMOST BE THEIR PARENT.

766
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I HAVE TO TELL THEM.

767
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I SAID I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT I

768
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
LOVE YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND THAT

769
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

770
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE LAST

771
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
THING THEY WERE EVER GOING TO

772
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
HEAR.

773
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL GOING TO

774
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
DIE.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S

775
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
OKAY.
I WANTED THEM TO KNOW SOMEONE

776
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
LOVED THEM AND I WANTED THAT TO

777
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
BE ONE OF THE LAST THINGS THEY

778
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
HEARD.

779
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
