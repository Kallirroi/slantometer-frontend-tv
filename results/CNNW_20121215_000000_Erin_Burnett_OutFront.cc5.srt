00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
WITNESSED, THOSE CHILDREN WHO

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EYES AND EARS TO SHUT OUT THE

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
HORROR, THEY NEED TIME, LOVE,

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
THEY'RE GOING TO HUG THEIR

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
PROCESS THIS AS A NATION, THAT

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
IS GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME.

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
>> I THINK ALL OF US ARE TRYING

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
TO DEAL WITH THIS.

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE, IF YOU'RE ONE

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE IS YOU

22
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
SEND YOUR KIDS OFF TO SCHOOL AND

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE

24
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
SAFE AND COME HOME AND THEY

25
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
DON'T.
THAT'S HEARTBREAKING, IT REALLY

26
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000

THIS POINT IF HE KILLED HIMSELF.

77
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
POLICE DID SAY THAT THEY DID NOT

78
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000

IN A MEETING AT THE TIME THE

THOSE SHOOTINGS OCCURRED IN ONE

97
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
SECTION OF THE SCHOOL

98
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
CONCENTRATED IN ONE AREA,

99
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
SPECIFICALLY TWO ROOMS IN AN

100
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
AREA OF THE SCHOOL.

101
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
MOURNING.
AND TONIGHT THERE IS A VIGIL

105
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE.

106
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
THE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT OBAMA,

107
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
ORDERING FLAGS TO FLY AT HALF

STAFF NATIONWIDE IN A TRIBUTE TO

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THE VICTIMS OF THIS TERRIBLE

110
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
TRAGEDY.

111
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
AN EXTRAORDINARILY EMOTIONAL

112
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
PRESIDENT ADDRESSED THE NATION

113
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
THIS AFTERNOON.

114
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
>> I KNOW THERE'S NOT A PARENT

115
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
IN AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

116
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I

117
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
DO.

118
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

119
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

120
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

121
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

122
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

123
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

124
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

125
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
WEDDINGS.

126
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

127
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT,

128
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL AS HE

129
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
ADDRESSED REPORTERS IN THE

130
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
NATION AS THESE HORRIBLE DETAILS

131
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
BECAME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT

132
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
MOMENT BY MOMENT TODAY.

133
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
MY COLLEAGUE SUSAN CANDIOTTI HAS

134
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
BEEN WORKING NOT ONLY THE SCENE

135
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
OF THE SHOOTING AT SANDY HOOK

136
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
ELEMENTARY BUT ALSO POLICE

137
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
SOURCES THROUGHOUT THIS

138
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
COMMUNITY AS WELL.

139
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT

140
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
SOME REMARKABLE INFORMATION

141
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

142
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
>> IT REALLY HAS BEEN STUNNING

143
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY TO TRY TO

144
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
FIGURE OUT THE MOTIVE OF THE

145
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
SHOOTING AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW

146
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
THE ANSWER TO THAT VERY

147
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
IMPORTANT QUESTION RIGHT NOW.

148
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
AS YOU INDICATED ASHLEIGH, WHAT

149
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
WE ARE FINDING OUT IS A LITTLE

150
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
BIT ABOUT THE SHOOTER BUT NOT

151
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
MUCH.

152
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
ONLY THAT HE WAS DRESSED IN

153
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
BLACK MILITARY FATIGUES AND THE

154
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
A MILITARY-TYPE VEST.

155
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY

156
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
DISCOVERED AT LEAST THREE

157
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
WEAPONS ON THE SCENE.

158
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
TWO HANDGUNS --

159
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
>> IN FACT, A GLOCK, A SIG

160
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
SAUER, AND A BUSHMASTER 223.

161
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
>> EXACTLY.
THE BUSHMASTER 223 IS A

162
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPON.

163
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
WE HAVE PICTURES OF THAT TO SHOW

164
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
YOU THE TYPE OF WEAPON.

165
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
IT IS NOT THE WEAPON IN

166
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
QUESTION, OF COURSE.

167
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
WE HAVE YET TO FIND OUT, FOR

168
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
EXAMPLE, WHERE THOSE WEAPONS

169
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
CAME FROM.

170
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
WERE THEY LEGALLY PURCHASED,

171
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
WERE THEY STOLEN, TO WHOM WHEN

172
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
THEY BRIDGE ADMINISTERED.

173
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
>> WE'VE HAD BREAKING NEWS IN
THE LAST WHILE, THAT IN FACT

174
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THOSE WEAPONS, AT LEAST I

175
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
BELIEVE TWO OF THEM, WERE

176
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
REGISTERED TO THE MOTHER.

177
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
NANCY LANZA.

178
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
IT'S A VERY DISTRESSING DETAIL.

179
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
>> THAT IS INDEED.

180
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
>> AT LEAST TWO OF THOSE

181
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
WEAPONS, IN FACT, LET ME CHANGE

182
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THAT, AT LEAST THREE OF THE

183
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
WEAPONS REG JERRED TO NANCY

184
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
LANZA.
>> OF COURSE, HER BODY WAS FOUND

185
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
AT A RESIDENCE RIGHT HERE IN THE

186
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
AREA.
>> AN ODD DEVELOPMENT.

187
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
SUSAN AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

188
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
PIECE TOGETHER WHEN THE POLICE

189
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
SAID THAT THE SHOOTER KILLED

190
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
SOMEONE HE LIVED WITH, AND THEN

191
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
WE'VE NOW FOUND OUT THAT NANCY

192
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
LANZA WAS FOUND IN HER SON'S

193
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
HOME, PUTTING TWO AND TWO

194
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
TOGETHER, YOU'D WANT TO COME TO

195
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A CONCLUSION, BUT THEY ARE NOT

196
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
RELEASING THAT.

197
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
>> IT MAY VERY WELL BE THE

198
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
MOTHER'S HOME.
THEY SAY THE SUSPECT'S

199
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
RESIDENCE.

200
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
WELL, IT MAY BE -- VERY WELL MAY

201
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
BE WHERE BOTH OF THEM LIVED

202
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
TOGETHER.
SO THAT AGAIN MAKES ONE WONDER,

203
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
WHAT PROMPTED ALL OF THIS?

204
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
WAS THERE SOMETHING GOING ON?

205
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
IT'S HARD NOT TO SPECULATE.

206
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
>> THE CONFUSION IS, WELL,

207
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
SUSAN, THROUGHOUT THE DAY, THE

208
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
NAME RYAN LANZA WAS BEING

209
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
REPORTED FAST AND FURIOUSLY.

210
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
THIS IS THE BROTHER WHO WAS
TAKEN AWAY IN HANDCUFFS FROM THE

211
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
APARTMENT IN HOBOKEN FOR

212
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
QUESTIONING.

213
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
NOT UNDER ARREST, NOT A SUSPECT.

214
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
BUT FOR A LONG TIME, PEOPLE WERE

215
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
SUSPECTING THAT RYAN LANZA MIGHT

216
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
BE THE SHOOTER.

217
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
NOT THE SHOOTER, ACCORDING TO

218
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
POLICE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

219
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
THERE WAS CONFLICTING
INFORMATION EVEN AMONG LAW

220
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES FOR

221
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
HOURS NOW.

222
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
FINALLY, IT SEEMS TO BE SORTED

223
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
OUT, THAT IN FACT IT IS RYAN AS

224
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
YOU SAID WHO WAS LED AWAY FOR

225
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
QUESTIONING, NOT CONSIDERED A

226
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
SUSPECT.

227
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
BUT THEY WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT

228
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
THEY COULD ABOUT HIS BROTHER.

229
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
>> DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

230
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
THIS FAMILY?

231
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
POLICE HAVE SAID THAT APPARENTLY

232
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
ADAM LANZA DID NOT HAVE A

233
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
CRIMINAL RECORD, AND YET THIS IS

234
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
ONE OF THE MOST HORRIFIC CRIMES

235
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
PERPETRATED IN THE MOST HORRIFIC

236
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
WAY.
DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT

237
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THE FAMILY DYNAMICS?

238
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
>> WE HAVE BEEN LEARNING MORE

239
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
ABOUT -- A BIT ABOUT THE

240
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
BROTHER, ADAM, THE SHOOTER, IN

241
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
THIS CASE.

242
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
BUT WE ARE STILL TRYING TO GET

243
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
THAT CONFIRMED WITH ADDITIONAL

244
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
SOURCES BEFORE WE PUT THAT OUT

245
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
OFFICIALLY.

246
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
BUT WE DO KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE,

247
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
THAT THE FATHER OF BOTH OF THEM

248
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
WAS DIVORCED FROM NANCY LANZA,

249
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
THE SCHOOLTEACHER, AND THE BOYS'

250
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
MOTHER.
>> AND DID NOT LIVE AT THIS

251
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
RESIDENCE?

252
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
>> THE FATHER DID NOT LIVE AT

253
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THIS RESIDENCE, BUT IN FACT HE

254
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
HAS REMARRIED AND DOES LIVE IN

255
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
THIS AREA OF NEWTOWN,

256
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
CONNECTICUT, AS WELL.
SO THEY'VE BEEN TALKING TO HIM,

257
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
OBVIOUSLY, AS WELL, TO TRY TO

258
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
FIND OUT WHAT INFORMATION, IF

259
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
ANY, HE MAY HAVE, WHAT CLUES, IF

260
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
ANY, HE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE THAT

261
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
LED TO THIS.

262
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
>> IT'S REMARKABLE THE AMOUNT OF

263
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
INFORMATION THAT KEEPS POURS IN.

264
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'M GOING TO LET YOU WORK YOUR

265
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
SOURCES.
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE

266
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
HOUR AFTER HOUR.

267
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI DOING A TERRIFIC

268
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
JOB.
I WANT TO TAKE YOU TO JASON

269
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
CARROLL, MY COLLEAGUE, NOT FAR

270
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
AWAY FROM US IN NEWTOWN,

271
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
CONNECTICUT, IN FRONT OF SAINT

272
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
ROSE OF LIMA CHURCH.

273
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
SET THE SCENE FOR ME.

274
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
>> IT'S A VERY SOMBER SCENE AND

275
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
SO MANY PEOPLE HERE TRIED TO
COME OUT FOR THIS VIGIL.

276
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME THERE

277
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
WASN'T ENOUGH ROOM FOR EVERYONE

278
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
INSIDE THE CHURCH.

279
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
HUNDREDS PACKED INSIDE, HUNDREDS

280
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
MORE OUTSIDE THE CHURCH.

281
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE TOLD GOVERNOR

282
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
MALLOY IS SPEAKING INSIDE THE

283
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
CHURCH.

284
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
A LITTLE EARLIER TODAY,

285
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
ASHLEIGH, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

286
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
TO SPEAK WITH THE DEACON HERE.

287
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS

288
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
COMMUNITY, HE KNEW SOME OF THE

289
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
VICTIMS.
SOME OF THE CHILDREN THAT LOST

290
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
THEIR LIVES.

291
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
THOSE WERE THE SAME CHILDREN

292
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
THAT HE USED TO STARE AT AND SEE

293
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
IN THE CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY.

294
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
SOME OF THESE CHILDREN HAD THEIR

295
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
FIRST COMMUNION HERE.

296
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
HE KNEW THE SCHOOL FACULTY,

297
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
SERVICE FACULTY CAME TO THIS

298
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
CHURCH AS WELL.

299
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
DURING A VERY EMOTIONAL MOMENT,

300
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO PART OF

301
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD A

302
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
LITTLE EARLIER ABOUT HOW ALL OF

303
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
THIS HAS AFFECTED HIM AND THE
COMMUNITY.

304
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
>> IT'S A VERY TIGHT-KNIT

305
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
COMMUNITY.
IT'S A VERY LARGE PARISH, A

306
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
DYNAMIC PARISH.

307
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY HERE.

308
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
AND I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT

309
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'M SURE THAT QUITE A FEW OF THE

310
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
KIDS THAT WE LOST TODAY ARE IN

311
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
THIS PARISH.

312
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I HEARD ONE OF THE VICTIMS, I'M

313
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
NOT SURE ABOUT IT, BUT I HEARD

314
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS,

315
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
RECENTLY SHE -- I THINK IT WAS

316
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
BIRTHDAY MONEY, SHE GOT HER

317
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
BIRTHDAY MONEY, BIRTHDAY GIFTS.

318
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
SHE DONATED IT TO THE PARISH TO

319
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
GIVE FOR THE HURRICANE SANDY

320
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
VICTIMS.
6 YEARS OLD.

321
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
SO THAT'S -- THAT MAKES IT VERY,

322
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
VERY PERSONAL.
VERY INTIMATE.

323
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
>> Reporter: PERSONAL FOR HIM

324
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
AND ALSO PAINFUL, NOT JUST FOR

325
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
THE DEACON HERE BUT FOR THE

326
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

327
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
PACKED INSIDE THE CHURCH.

328
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
AND AGAIN, OUTSIDE THE CHURCH AS

329
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
YOU CAN SEE HERE, LISTENING,

330
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
TRYING TO FIND SOME SORT OF

331
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
COMFORT.
THE DEACON ALSO TOLD ME,

332
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
ASHLEIGH, THROUGHOUT THE DAY HE

333
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
WAS COUNSELING SOME 100 PEOPLE

334
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
WHO HAD COME THROUGH THE CHURCH

335
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
DOORS LOOKING FOR ANSWERS, JUST

336
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
ASKING QUESTIONS.

337
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
THE BIG QUESTION AS YOU CAN

338
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
IMAGINE, MOST PEOPLE THAT WERE

339
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
COMING IN AND ASKING WAS, WHY?

340
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
WHY ALL OF THIS HAPPENED.

341
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
AND HE SAID, BECAUSE OF THE

342
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
NEWNESS OF IT ALL, HE SAID IT

343
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A WAY TO

344
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
SAY SOMETHING PROFOUND.

345
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
BUT HE DID REFER TO ONE QUOTE.

346
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
HE SAID, WHEN EVERYONE COMES IN

347
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THE AND THEY ASK ME WHY, I PUT

348
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
MY ARM AROUND THEM AND I SAY,

349
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
ASKING WHY, SOME QUESTIONS ARE

350
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
ONLY MEANT FOR GOD TO ANSWER.

351
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
LITTLE COMFORT BUT THAT'S ALL

352
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THEY CAN DO AT THIS POINT.

353
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
TRYING TO PROVIDE COMFORT AS

354
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
EVERYONE HERE TRIES TO GET

355
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
THROUGH THIS VERY PAINFUL

356
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
MOMENT.

357
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
ASHLEIGH?
>> JUST AN EXTRAORDINARY TIME,

358
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
AND I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW THEY'RE

359
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
GOING TO FIND THAT COMFORT, SO

360
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
SOON AFTER THIS HAS HAPPENED.

361
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
JASON CARROLL REPORTING FOR US

362
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000

I AM RIGHT NOW.

364
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
THIS HAS BECOME A MULTI-STATE

365
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
INVESTIGATION.

366
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
POLICE WERE SEARCHING A HOME IN

367
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY, EARLIER ON

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000

HE WAS HANDCUFFED AS THEY LED

372
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000

373
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
HE IS BELIEVED TO BE THE BROTHER

374
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
OF THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER.

375
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
THEY ARE NOT SAYING AT THIS TIME

376
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
HE'S A SUSPECT IN ANYTHING, JUST

377
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
THAT HE'S WANTED FOR

378
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
QUESTIONING.

379
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
MY COLLEAGUE JOHN BERMAN IS LIVE

380
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000

383
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
BE WHY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
HANDCUFFED, JOHN.

384
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000

ASHLEIGH, AT THIS POINT WE

387
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
AS YOU SAY THIS HAS BEEN THE

388
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
SITE OF AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

389
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000

390
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000

00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000

APPARENTLY OF RYAN LANZA,

400
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
BROUGHT IN FOR QUESTIONING, NOT

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
BELIEVED TO BE CONNECTED IN ANY

402
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
WAY TO THE SUSPECT ADAM LANZA.

403
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
THE HOBOKEN POLICE WERE HERE,

404
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
JERSEY CITY POLICE WERE HERE,

405
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
THERE WAS A BOMB SQUAD HERE, FBI

407
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000

410
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
BUT AT THIS POINT, IT IS NOW

411
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
CLEAR THAT THE SHOOTER WAS NOT

412
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
RYAN LANZA, IT WAS HIS BROTHER

413
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
ADAM LANZA.

414
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
RYAN WE BELIEVE IS STILL IN

415
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
CUSTODY.

WHERE RYAN LANZA LIVES.

424
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
IT'S A FIVE-STORY APARTMENT

TWO AND THREE BEDROOM

426
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000

436
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000

JOHN BERMAN LIVE IN HOE BOKE 10

440
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
OBVIOUSLY AS THIS STARTED TO

442
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
TRANSPIRE ALARM BELLS WENT OFF

443
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT HERE.

444
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL DISTRICT WENT

445
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
INTO LOCKDOWN.

446
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
THE REACTION WAS SWIFT AND THE

447
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
ACTIONS OF TEACHERS THROUGHOUT

448
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
THIS DISTRICT WERE SERIOUS.

449
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
RENEE BURN IS ONE OF THESE

450
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000

TEACHERS AT SANDY HOOK

454
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
ELEMENTARY AS WELL.

COUPLE OF HOURS FOLLOWING THE

457
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
SHOOTING.

458
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
RENEE, THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO

00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000

461
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
FOR YOU AND WHEN YOU ULTIMATELY

462
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
FOUND OUT WHY YOU WERE IN

463
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
LOCKDOWN.

464
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
>> IT STARTED OUT AS A NORMAL

465
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
DAY.
WE HAD OUR HOL LAY PARTY

466
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
SCHEDULED FOR OUR KINDERGARTEN

467
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
CLASS WHICH WAS SCHEDULED TO

468
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
START ABOUT 10:15.

469
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
AND ABOUT 9:45, WE HEARD THE

470
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE WERE IN

471
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
LO
LOCKDOWN.

472
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
>> DID YOU THINK THIS WOULD BE A

473
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
DRILL?
>> I KNEW IT WASN'T A DRILL

474
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
BECAUSE WE HAD ABOUT 60 PARENTS

475
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
SCHEDULED TO COME INTO THE

476
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
SCHOOL FOR OUR CELEBRATION.

477
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
AND I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING

478
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
GOING ON.

479
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
BUT NEVER, NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS

480
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

481
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
THE LAST TIME WE WENT INTO A

482
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
LOCKDOWN WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS

483
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
SOMETHING TO DO WITH A BANK

484
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
HOLDUP IN TOWN AND JUST AS A

485
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
MATTER OF COURSE THEY SHUT DOWN

486
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
THE SCHOOLS.

487
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
>> WHEN THIS HAPPENED, WHAT DID

488
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
YOU DO RIGHT AWAY?

489
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
>> WE KEPT ALL THE KIDS CALM AND

490
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
QUIET AND WE CLOSED OUR DOORS

491
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
AND WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE ABOUT

492
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
WITHIN THE SCHOOL.

493
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
BUT NO ONE WAS TOO GO IN OR OUT.

494
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
>> WERE YOU GETTING ANY TEXT

495
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
MESSAGES OR E-MAILS FROM FAMILY

496
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
OR FRIENDS?

497
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
>> IT STARTED ALMOST

498
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
IMMEDIATELY.

499
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
PEOPLE WANT TUESDAY KNOW WHAT

500
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
WE COULDN'T GO ON THE INTERNET,

502
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
WE COULDN'T TAKE PHONE CALLS.
>> YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO TAKE

503
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
PHONE CALLS AT THIS TIME?

504
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
>> WE WERE TAKING OUR CELL PHONE

505
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
CALLS BUT NO REGULAR PHONE CALLS

506
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
WERE COMING IN AND OUT OF THE

507
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
SCHOOL.

508
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP WHEN MY

509
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
SON CALLED ME FROM NEW YORK AND

510
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING

511
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
ON.
AT THAT POINT, WE HAD NO

512
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
INFORMATION.

513
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
>> THIS IS A SMALL COMMUNITY.

514
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
AND YOU KNEW SOME OF THE

515
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
TEACHERS OR YOU CERTAIN LLY DO

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
IT'S SUCH A SMALL COMMUNITY, WE

519
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
KNOW ALL THE TEACHERS.

520
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
ONE OF OUR TEACHERS HAD A

521
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
DAUGHTER IN KINDERGARTEN AT

522
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
SANDY HOOK SCHOOL SO WE WERE

523
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
FRANTIC.
>> THAT IS CHILD ACCOUNTED FOR?

524
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
>> SHE'S OKAY.

525
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
THANK GOD SHE'S OKAY BUT WE

526
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
DIDN'T KNOW THAT FOR QUITE A

527
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
WHILE.

528
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
>> FOR HOW LONG WAS SHE UNAWARE

529
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
AND COULDN'T LEAVE THE SCHOOL?

530
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000

531
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
AND HE COULDN'T CALL THE SCHOOL

532
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
AND WE HAD NO INFORMATION.

533
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
IT WAS A GOOD TWO HOURS INTO IT.

534
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000

SHELVES NEW THIS YEAR, BUT I

538
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
UNDERSTAND SHE HAS FIVE CHILDREN

539
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM.

540
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000

541
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000

748
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
AND POLICE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE

749
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
OUT WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED.

750

THE MEDICAL EXAMINER IS SETTING

THAT A TOWN THIS SMALL COULD

763
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
HAVE DONE THIS.

764
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
THEY HAVE HAD SO MANY

765
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
COMMUNITIES COME IN TO HELP.

766
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000

COME FORWARD.

777
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
>> SOMETIMES WHEN THESE STORIES

778
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
BREAK, LIVING IN A LARGE

779
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
COMMUNITY LIKE HARTFORD,

780
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
CERTAINLY NEW YORK, STANFORD,

781
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
ANY OF THESE SURROUNDING

782
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
COMMUNITIES, YOU HEAR THE REPORT

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
OF SHOTS FIRED OR SOME KIND OF

784
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
VIOLENCE BEING PERPETRATED AND

785
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
IT MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A SURPRISE.

786
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
THEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS TOWN.

787
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

788
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST REACTION IN

789
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
YOUR NEWSROOM?
>> I WASN'T IN THE NEWSROOM.

790
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I GOT A CALL FROM A FRIEND WHO

791
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
SAID, THERE'S A REPORT OF SHOTS

792
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
FIRED AT A SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN,

793
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
AND I STARTED HEADING HERE,

794
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
CONTACTED MY BOSS.

795
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
HE SAID, GET DOWN THERE.

796
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
>> WERE YOU FAMILIAR WITH

797
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
NEWTOWN?
BEEN HERE BEFORE, IT'S A VERY

798
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
NICE COMMUNITY, A SAFE COMMUNITY

799
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
JUST AS YOU DESCRIBED.

800
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
A VERY NICE PLACE TO LIVE.

801
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
>> AGAIN, JUST TO HEAR THE

802
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
STATISTIC, ONE MURDER IN TEN

803
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
YEARS, THIS HAD TO BE

804
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
ASTOUNDING.
>> YES.

805
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
>> DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA THE

806
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
MAGNITUDE OF WHAT'S GOING TO

807
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
UNFOLD?
>> I DIDN'T.

808
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
AS INFORMATION BEGAN TO COME

809
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
OUT, IT BECAME CLEAR THAT IT WAS
GOING TO BE AWFUL.

810
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
IT'S AWFUL BEYOND COMPREHENSION.

811
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
>> THE ATF IS HERE, THE FBI IS

812
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
HERE, THE CONNECTICUT STATE

813
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
POLICE, OBVIOUSLY THE LOCAL

814
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
POLICE AS WELL.

815
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA ABOUT

816
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
ADDITIONAL MANPOWER THAT MAY BE

817
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
HEADED THIS WAY?

818
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
>> THERE'S ALL KINDS OF

819
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
AGENCIES.

820
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I BELIEVE THE MARSHALS ARE HERE.

821
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS

822
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
PROVIDING SUPPORT.

823
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
IT'S PRIMARILY GOING TO BE A

824
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
STATE POLICE CASE WITH

825
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
HIGH-TRAINED MAJOR CRIME SQUADS

826
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
THAT WILL DO THE FORENSIC

827
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
INVESTIGATION IN THE SCHOOL AND

828
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
THE DETECTIVES, WORKING WITH THE

829
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
NEWTOWN DETECTIVES, FIGURING OUT

830
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
WHAT HAPPENED HERE AND WHY.

831
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
>> OF COURSE, THERE IS THIS

832
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
SECONDARY CRIME SCENE.
THE RESIDENTS.

833
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
>> YES.
>> WHERE THE MOTHER WAS

834
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
DISCOVERED IN THE RESIDENCE OF

835
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
HER SON.
WE'RE NOT CLEAR AS TO WHETHER

836
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
THE MONEY AND THE SON, THAN

837
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
CONTRACT LANZA, THE MOTHER, ADAM

838
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
LANZA, WHETHER THEY LIVED

839
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
TOGETHER.

840
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT

841
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
THIS FAMILY, THE LANZA FAMILY?

842
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
>> I DON'T.

843
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
MY UNDERSTANDING IS SHE WAS A

844
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
TEACHER.

845
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
BUT I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

846
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
DETAIL.
MY COLLEAGUES BACK IN HARTFORD

847
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
ARE WORKING ON THAT KIND OF

848
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
INFORMATION.

849
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
>> AND THEN THERE WAS THIS -- A

850
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
DIVORCE, A FATHER WHO LIVED IN A

851
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
DIFFERENT PART OF THE COMMUNITY

852
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
BUT CERTAINLY IN THIS AREA.

853
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
IS THERE ANY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HIS

854
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
WHEREABOUTS AND WHETHER HE WAS

855
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
ABLE TO HELP IN THIS

856
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
INVESTIGATION?
>> HE LIVED IN A COMMUNITY NEAR

857
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
NEWTOWN IN FAIRFIELD COUNTY.

858
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
>> SO FAR, NO INFORMATION ON

859
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
WHETHER POLICE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

860
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
INTERVIEW HIM, TALK TO HIM?

861
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
>> POLICE HAVE TALKED TO

862
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
EVERYBODY IN THE FAMILY.

863
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND.

864
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
>> AND THEN JUST, IF YOU WOULD,

865
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
DAVID, MAYBE JUST TAKE ME TO THE

866
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
SCENE OF THE FIREHOUSE WHERE AS

867
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
THIS EMERGENCY WAS UNFOLDING,

868
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
THE TEACHERS WHO HAD THE

869
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
WHEREWITHAL TO GET THOSE
CHILDREN OUT, EVACUATE THE ONES

870
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
THEY COULD, THEY RAN.

871
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
THEY PHYSICALLY RAN THE DISTANCE

872
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND THE

873
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
FIREHOUSE FOR SHELTER, RIGHT?

874
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
>> THE POLICE WERE AT THE SCHOOL

875
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
VERY QUICKLY.

876
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
THEY WENT RIGHT IN.

877
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
AND THE TEACHERS AS YOU

878
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
DESCRIBED HAD LOCKED THE DOORS.

879
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
THE POLICE STARTED ESCORTING THE

880
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
KIDS OUT.
THEY SAID, HOLD HANDS AND CLOSE

881
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
YOUR EYES.

882
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
AND THE KIDS --

883
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
>> THE POLICE TOLD THE CHILDREN,

884
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
HOLD HANDS AND CLOSE YOUR EYES.

885
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
THIS SQUARES WITH WHAT ONE OF

886
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
THE CHILDREN HAD TOLD THE LOCAL

887
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
REPORTER, THEY HAD BEEN ASKED TO

888
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
AVERT THEIR EYES AS THEY WENT

889
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
PAST THIS AREA.

890
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
>> THEY OPENED THEIR EYES WHEN

891
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
THEY GOT OUTSIDE, THEY WERE

892
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
HUSTLED OVER TO THE FIREHOUSE

893
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
WHERE THEY WERE ENVELOPED AND

894
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
TAKEN CARE OF AND PARENTS BEGAN

895
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
TO ARRIVE.

896
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
PANICKED PARENTS.

897
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
AS TRAUMATIC AND AS PANICKY AS

898
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
THIS MAY HAVE BEEN, IT WAS

899
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
REMARKABLY CALM AS PARENTS

900
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
ARRIVED.

901
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
>> AMAZING.
>> TO CHECK, TO PICK UP THEIR

902
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
CHILDREN.
>> STAND BY IF YOU WILL, I JUST

903
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
WANT TO MAKE A NOTE WE'RE

904
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
GETTING SOME VIDEO BEING FED IN

905
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
TO US LIVE RIGHT NOW.

906
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
JUST ACROSS TOWN TRANSFER TWO

907
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
VIGILS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING

908
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
PLACE.
DAN MAY DO I, THE GOVERNOR, IS

909
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
SPEAKING AT ONE OF THEM.

910
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
>> IN THE COMING DAYS AS MANY OF

911
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
US PREPARE TO CELEBRATE THE

912
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
BIRTH OF CHRIST, UNDERSTAND THAT

913
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
THAT TOO WILL BRING SORROW AS WE

914
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
THINK ABOUT THESE INSTANCES THAT

915
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
HAVE HAPPENED SO CLOSE TO THOSE

916
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
DAYS.
THAT TOO WILL PASS AND BE

917
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
OVERCOME.

918
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
AND ALL OF OUR PRAYERS AND THE

919
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000

935
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
HE'S STILL WITH ME.

936
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE

937
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
GOVERNOR.
DAN MALLOY HAS BEEN HERE TO

938
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
UPDATE US ON SOME OF THE

939
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
INFORMATION, AS WELL AS THE

940
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
LIEUTENANT WITH THE STATE POLICE

941
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
WHO HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL.

942
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID

943
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
EARLIER THAT STOOD OUT TO ME.

944
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
THAT IS, WHEN ALL OF THOSE

945
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
PARENTS CONGREGATED AT THE FIRE

946
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
STATION, MANY OF THEM WERE

947
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
REUNITED WITH CHILDREN.

948
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
AS THE CHILDREN WERE FOUND AND

949
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
BROUGHT OVER, BUT THERE WAS ONE

950
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
POINT WHERE THE GOVERNOR

951
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
ACTUALLY SAID TO THE PARENTS,

952
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
ANYONE WHO HASN'T BEEN REUNITED

953
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
WITH YOUR CHILDREN, YOU WILL NOT

954
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
BE.

955
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE

956
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
MOST DIFFICULT TIMES.

957
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE IT FOR

958
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
ANYBODY.
IT'S JUST A PARENT'S NIGHTMARE.

959
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
10-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, I CAN'T

960
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
IMAGINE WHAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE

961
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
GOING THROUGH.
>> AND I WANT TO JUST HEAD BACK

962
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
INTO THIS VIGIL FOR A MOMENT AND

963
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
LISTEN IN.

982
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000

REGULAR UPDATES, STAND UNTIL

987
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
SOLIDARITY WITH THE LAW

988

ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND

989
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
GOVERNOR DAN MALLOY, WHO HAS

990
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
ALSO BEEN GIVING REGULAR UPDATES

991
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
TO THE MEDIA AND HAS BEEN

992
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
MEETING PERSONALLY WITH THESE

993
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
FAMILIES, PARTICULARLY THE MOST

994
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
POIGNANT MOMENT I HEARD OF

995
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
TODAY.
THAT WAS THE GOVERNOR OF THIS

996
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
STATE ADDRESSING THESE FAMILIES

997
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME LETTING

998
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
THESE FAMILIES KNOW ANYONE WHO

999
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
HAS NOT BEEN REUNITED WITH YOUR

1000
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
CHILDREN, AT THIS POINT THERE

1001
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
WILL BE NO MORE CHILDREN

1002
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
REUNITED WITH FAMILIES.

1003
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
IT HAD TO BE SAID THIS WAY I CAN

1004
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
ONLY IMAGINE BECAUSE THOSE

1005
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
POSITIVE IDENTIFICATIONS HAVE

1006
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
NOT BEEN MADE.

1007
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
THIS IS AN OVERWHELMING FORENSIC

1008
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
TASK THAT IS GOING ON AS WE

1009
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
SPEAK IN THE SCHOOLS.

1010
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
IN THE SCHOOL.

1011
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
IF YOU CAN IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT

1012
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
THE TEAMS THAT ARE GOING INTO

1013
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
THAT SCHOOL TO IDENTIFY EVERY

1014
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
ONE OF THOSE 18 LITTLE BODIES.

1015
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
18 OF THOSE CHILDREN DIED WHERE

1016
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
THEY WERE IN THAT SCHOOL.

1017
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
THEIR BODIES REMAIN THERE.

1018
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
TWO ADDITIONAL CHILDREN WERE

1019
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
RACED TO THE HOSPITAL.

1020
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
THEY WERE HOPING THEY COULD SAVE

1021
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
THEM BUT THEY DIED IN THE

1022
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
HOSPITAL.
SIX OF THE ADULTS WERE ALSO

1023
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
KILLED ON THE SCENE.

1024
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE 20

1025
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
PEOPLE MUST BE IDENTIFIED.

1026
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
THAT IS A MAMMOTH TASK AND THE

1027
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
GOVERNOR WAS TRYING TO DO WHAT

1028
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
HE COULD TO AT LEAST GIVE

1029
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
WHATEVER INFORMATION HE POSSIBLY

1030
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
COULD DO THESE FAMILIES.

1031
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
LET'S GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT

1032
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
SOME OF THESE LIVE SCENES IN THE

1033
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
VIGIL THAT'S JUST ACROSS TOWN.

1034
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
MY COLLEAGUE JASON CARROLL IS

1035
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
STANDING BY OUTSIDE OF THE

1036
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
VIGIL.

1037
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
JASON, I'M HAVING TROUBLE

1038
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
HEARING BUT IF YOU COULD SET THE

1039
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
SCENE FOR ME THERE AND LET ME

1040
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
KNOW WHO HAS ATTENDED, WHO

1041
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
SHOWED UP FOR TONIGHT'S VISIBLE

1042
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
JILL WHERE YOU ARE?

1043
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
>> Reporter: THOUSANDS TRIED TO
OR SHOWED UP HERE AT THE CHURCH

1044
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
AT ST. ROSE LIMA CHURCH.

1045
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
AT LEAST 500 PEOPLE PACKED

1046
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
INSIDE.
MORE OUTSIDE, IF YOU LOOK BEHIND

1047
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
ME, THERE ARE SEVERAL HUNDRED

1048
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE IN THE

1049
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
FREEZING COLD.

1050
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR

1051
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
EVERYONE INSIDE THE CHURCH

1052
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
TONIGHT, ASHLEIGH.

1053
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
THE REASON FOR THAT IS SIMPLY

1054
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
BECAUSE THIS IS A COMMUNITY, YOU

1055
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
HEARD IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

1056
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT IS A

1057
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
CLOSE COMMUNITY.

1058
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HERE KNEW

1059
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
EACH OTHER.

1060
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
WHEN THE WORD STARTED TO SPREAD

1061
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
THERE WAS GOING TO BE A VIGIL

1062
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
HERE TONIGHT, EVERYONE CAME OUT.

1063
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
EVERYONE LOOKING FOR COMFORT.

1064
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
EVERYONE GRIEVING HERE IN THIS

1065
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
COMMUNITY.
EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T PERSONALLY

1066
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
LOSE SOMEONE, THE FEELING OF

1067
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
LOSS IS STILL THERE FOR SO MANY

1068
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
PEOPLE HERE.
WE'RE HEARING MORE TONIGHT ABOUT

1069
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
THE PRINCIPAL OF THIS SCHOOL AS

1070
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
WELL.

1071
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
DAWN LAFFERTY HOCKSBRAWN.

1072
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
47 YEARS OLD.

1073
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
BY ALL ACCOUNTS LOVED THE SCHOOL

1074
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
SHE HAD WORKED AT SINCE JUNE

1075
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
2010.
HERE'S WHAT'S INTERESTING.

1076
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
SHE HAD RECENTLY INSTALLED A NEW

1077
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
SECURITY SYSTEM AT THE SCHOOL

1078
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
WHERE VISITORS ACTUALLY HAD TO

1079
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
BE THE BUZZED TO BE LET IN.

1080
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
THIS WAS A SCHOOL, SHE WAS KNOWN

1081
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
AS A TOUGH LADY, THIS WAS A

1082
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
SCHOOL SHE CARED DEEPLY, DEEPLY

1083
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
ABOUT.
AND SHE HAD ALSO MAINTAINED A

1084
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
VERY ACTIVE TWITTER ACCOUNT.

1085
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
IN FACT, JUST ON DECEMBER 12th,

1086
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I SAW ONE OF THE TWEETS SHE HAD

1087
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
WRITTEN.
IT SAID, SANDY HOOK STUDENTS,

1088
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
ENJOY THE REHEARSAL FOR OUR

1089
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
FOURTH GRADE WINTER CONCERT.

1090
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE TWEETS

1091
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
SHE HAD JUST SENT OUT ON

1092
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
WEDNESDAY.
AND AS I WAS SAYING A LITTLE

1093
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
EARLIER, SO MANY PEOPLE WHO CAME

1094
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
OUT HERE TONIGHT, EVEN IF THEY

1095
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
DIDN'T LOSE ANYONE PERSONALLY,

1096
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
MOST LIKELY THEY KNEW SOMEONE AT

1097
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
THE SCHOOL.

1098
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
IN FACT, ONE OF THOSE WHO CAME

1099
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
OUT HERE TONIGHT, A AN THAT WE

1100
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
SPOKE TO OUT HERE, KNEW THE

1101
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
PRINCIPAL.

1102
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
HE TALKED ABOUT HER.

1103
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I JUST WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO

1104
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
WHAT HE HAD TO SAY BEFORE HE

1105
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
HEADED INSIDE INTO THE VIGIL.

1106
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
>> JASON, I'M HAVING TROUBLE

1107
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
CATCHING YOU.

1108
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I THINK I'VE LOST YOUR AUDIO.

1109
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I WANT TO JUST RESET THE SCENE

1110
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
FOR ANYONE JOINING US.

1111
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
JASON CARROLL HAS BEEN ACROSS

1112
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
TOWN AT A VIGIL THAT BEGAN AT

1113
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
7:00 TONIGHT FOR THOSE WHO WERE

1114
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
LOST AT NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, AT

1115
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

1116
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
SCHOOL, A SCHOOL THAT HAS

1117
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
STUDENTS FROM KIND GAR 10

1118
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
THROUGH FOURTH GRADE.

1119
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
IT IS A SCHOOL THAT HAS LOST 20,

1120
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
20 OF ITS STUDENTS.

1121
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
IN JUST A MATTER OF MINUTES.

1122
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
18 OF THEM DYING WHERE THEY

1123
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
WERE, TWO OF THEM BEING RUSHED

1124
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
TO THE HOSPITAL, DYING AT THE

1125
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
HOSPITAL.

1126
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
SIX OF THE ADULTS IN THE SCHOOL

1127
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
ALSO KILLED.

1128
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
THIS HAS BEEN AN UNBELIEVABLE

1129
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
DAY HERE IN THIS SLEEPY

1130
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
CONNECTICUT TOWN.

1131
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
POLICE ARE NOW IDENTIFYING THE

1132
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
SHOOTER AS ADAM LANZA.

1133
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR AN

1134
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
IDENTIFICATION BECAUSE HE ALSO

1135
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
HAS A BROTHER AND HIS BROTHER IS

1136
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
IN HOBOKEN, NAMED RYAN LANZA.

1137
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
HE WAS TAKEN AWAY IN HANDCUFFS

1138
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
FROM HIS APARTMENT IN HOBOKEN

1139
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
FOR QUESTIONING BUT THEY ARE NOT

1140
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
SAYING HE'S A SUSPECT AT THIS

1141
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
TIME.

1142
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
WE DO KNOW THAT NANCY LANZA, THE

1143
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
MOTHER OF THESE TWO YOUNG MEN,

1144
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
WAS KILLED TODAY AND THAT SHE

1145
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
WAS A TEACHER AT SANDY HOOK

1146
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
ELEMENTARY.

1147
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
TOM FOREMAN HAS BEEN PIECING

1148
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
TOGETHER HOW THIS TERRIBLE CRIME

1149
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
UNFOLDED FROM THE MOMENT THE

1150
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
FIRST FEW PHONE CALLS STARTED

1151
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
COMING IN JUST AFTER 9:30 IN THE

1152
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
MORNING.

1153
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
>> HI, ASHLEIGH.

1154
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THIS IS

1155
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
ABOUT TEN HOURS AGO ALMOST TO

1156
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
THE MINUTE THAT ALL OF THIS WAS

1157
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
GOING ON.

1158
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
9:30 THIS MORNING IT WAS A

1159
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
NORMAL START TO THE DAY AHERE.

1160
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
600 STUDENTS HERE, 50 FACULTY

1161
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
MEMBERS.
WE DON'T HAVE A COMPLETELY ON

1162
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
THE LAYOUT OF THE SCHOOL OR THE

1163
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
TIMELINE.
WE HAVE SOME IDEA, SO THE DAY

1164
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
WAS GETTING UNDER WAY, HAD BEEN

1165
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
UNDER WAY ABOUT 30 MINUTES.

1166
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
THERE WAS A MEETING HAPPENING UP

1167
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
HERE INVOLVING THE PRINCIPAL,

1168
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
THE VICE-PRINCIPAL, A SCHOOL

1169
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
PSYCHOLOGIST, AND SEVERAL OTHER

1170
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
ADULTS IN THIS AREA.

1171
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
THEN, AROUND 9:40 AS BEST WE CAN

1172
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
TELL FROM WITNESSES, JUST 10

1173
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
MINUTES LATER, IT WOULD APPEAR

1174
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
THAT'S WHEN THE GUNMAN ENTERS

1175
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
THE BUILDING.
HOW DID HE DO IT?

1176
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
JASON CARROLL MENTIONED THE NEW

1177
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
SECURITY SYSTEM.

1178
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
WE'RE NOT SURE HOW HE GOT PAST

1179
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
THAT.

1180
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
WE KNOW POLICE LOOKED HARD ALL
DAY AT A CAR PARKED IN THE FIRE

1181
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
LANE.
IT'S STILL THERE, SURROUNDED BY

1182
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
TAPE, AS BEST I CAN TELL.

1183
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
THE SUGGESTION WOULD BE FROM

1184
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
THIS AND FROM WITNESSES THAT IN

1185
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
FACT SOMEHOW THE GUNMAN DID COME

1186
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
RIGHT THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR

1187
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
HERE INTO THE SCHOOL AND ALMOST

1188
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
IMMEDIATELY PEOPLE THROUGHOUT

1189
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
THIS BUILDING REPORTED HEARING

1190
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
GUNFIRE.

1191
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
9:41.
THAT'S WHEN THE CALLS STARTED

1192
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
COMING IN TO 911.

1193
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
THE PRINCIPAL, THE

1194
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
VICE-PRINCIPAL, AND THE SCHOOL

1195
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
PSYCHOLOGIST WHO WERE IN THIS

1196
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
MEETING, ACCORDING TO THE

1197
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
WITNESSES, WENT INTO THE HALL
AND WENT TOWARD THAT GUNFIRE TO

1198
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

1199
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
THERE WAS SHOUTING, MANY SHOUTS

1200
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
AND SHOTS AND THE VICE-PRINCIPAL

1201
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
CAME BACK INTO THE MEETING ROOM

1202
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
WOUNDED BUT THE OTHER TWO DID

1203
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
NOT.
AUTHORITIES SAY ALL OF THE

1204
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
SHOOTING HAPPENED REALLY IN A

1205
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

1206
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
AND THEY SAY THE GUNMAN DID NOT

1207
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
ROAM AROUND BUT GENERALLY STAYED

1208
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
IN JUST TWO ROOMS AND A HALLWAY

1209
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
RIGHT UP HERE.

1210
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
THAT'S IN FACT WHERE THEY

1211
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
ULTIMATELY FOUND HIM.

1212
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
9:45.
TEACHERS WERE TRYING TO PROTECT

1213
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
STUDENTS ALL THROUGHOUT THIS

1214
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
SCHOOL.
SOME STUDENTS WERE NEAR THE

1215
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
GYMNASIUM, WERE TOLD TO HIDE IN

1216
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
CLOSETS.
OTHERS STUDENTS IN OTHER PARTS

1217
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
OF THE BUILDING SAY THEY WERE

1218
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
LED OUTSIDE TO FLEE.

1219
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR IF THAT

1220
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
HAPPENED WITH THE TEACHERS OR

1221
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
LATER WITH THEM BEING HELPED OUT

1222
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
BY SOME SORT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

1223
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
OFFICIALS.

1224
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
NONETHELESS, WE KNOW THAT THERE

1225
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
WAS A REAL EFFORT THROUGHOUT THE

1226
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
SCHOOL TO GET ALL OF THESE KIDS

1227
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
INTO SOME SORT OF SAFETY.

1228
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
THIS PICTURE BY THE WAY FROM

1229
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
"THE NEWTOWN BEE."
THERE WERE ALL THESE TEACHERS

1230
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

1231
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
THEY DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT WAS

1232
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
GOING ON.

1233
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR AT WHAT POINT IN

1234
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
THIS PROCESS THE GUNMAN DIED.

1235
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
LAW OFFICIALS SAY NO OFFICERS

1236
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
FIRED A WEAPON, BUT THEY DID

1237
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
FIND HIM DEAD IN ONE OF THE

1238
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
ROOMS THERE.

1239
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
THE SUGGESTION BEING PROBABLY

1240
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
THAT HE KILLED HIMSELF.

1241
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
BUT WE'LL GET MORE DETAILS OF

1242
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
THAT AS WE GO ON.

1243
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
THIS IS WHAT WE DO KNOW.

1244
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS

1245
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
ARRIVED AT THE SCHOOL, THEY

1246
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
IMMEDIATELY SET UP A PERIMETER

1247
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
AROUND IT.
IT WAS STATE AND LOCAL POLICE.

1248
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
AND OFFICERS SPREAD THROUGHOUT

1249
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
THE BUILDING.

1250
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
THEY SAY THEY ENTERED

1251
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
IMMEDIATELY TO SECURE ROOMS TO

1252
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
FIND STUDENTS AND TO MAKE SURE

1253
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
IF A GUN MAN WAS STILL ACTIVE

1254
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
THAT THEY GOT HIM UNDER CONTROL

1255
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
OR KILLED THEM IF THEY HAD TO.

1256
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
THEN THEY QUICKLY STARTED

1257
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
LEADING STUDENTS AWAY FROM THE

1258
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
SCHOOL, TRYING TO GET THEM OUT

1259
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
TO SAFETY.

1260
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
THIS WAS JUST A HORRENDOUS,

1261
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
HORRENDOUS EVENT, AS YOU KNOW.

1262
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
VERY DIFFICULT EVEN FOR THE

1263
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
OFFICERS WHO WERE INVOLVED

1264
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
BECAUSE THEY HAD TO, AS YOU

1265
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
SAID, TELL MANY OF THESE

1266
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
CHILDREN, AVERT YOUR EYES, CLOSE

1267
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
YOUR EYES, BECAUSE THEY KNEW

1268
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
THEY WERE GOING TO LEAD THEM

1269
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
RIGHT PAST MANY OF THE VICTIMS.

1270
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
ASHLEIGH, WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS

1271
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
IS THE EXACT TIMELINE BUT THIS

1272
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
IS A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT

1273
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
HAPPENED.
AGAIN, TEN HOURS AGO ALMOST TO

1274
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
THE MINUTE.

1275
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
ASHLEIGH?
>> IT ALL SEEMED TO TRANSPIRE SO

1276
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
QUICKLY, AS YOU SAID, IN SUCH A

1277
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
CONCENTRATED WAY, TOM.

1278
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
IT'S OVERWHELMING TO THINK OF

1279
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS THESE

1280
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
CHILDREN WERE DYING.

1281
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
AND WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE AS I SAY

1282
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
THOSE BODIES ARE STILL WHERE

1283
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
THEY LAY IN THAT SCHOOL AWAITING

1284
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
A POSITIVE I.D.

1285
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000

00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'M JOINED BY CONGRESSMAN ROSA

DELAURA VE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

1290
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
AT THE MONUMENT.

1291
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN OVERWHELMING

1292
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
NEWS.
HOW ARE YOU PROCESSING ALL OF

1293
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
THIS INFORMATION WHERE YOU ARE?

1294
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
>> WELL, IT'S REALLY -- IT IS

1295
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
OVERWHELMING, ASHLEIGH.

1296
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
IT'S UNTHINKABLE, WHAT HAPPENED

1297
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
TODAY.
IT HITS SO CLOSE TO HOME FOR ALL

1298
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
OF US.

1299
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
AND OBVIOUSLY OUR THOUGHTS, OUR

1300
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
PRAYERS, ARE WITH THE FAMILIES,

1301
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
WITH THE SIBLINGS, WITH PEOPLE

1302
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
WHO HAVE SUFFERED SUCH A TRAGIC

1303
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
LOSS.
I'M IN WASHINGTON THIS WEEKEND

1304
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
BECAUSE -- TO BE WITH MY

1305
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
GRANDCHILDREN WHO LIVE IN

1306
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
WASHINGTON, D.C.
THEY'RE 8, 5 1/2, 5, AND 3.

1307
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
SO THIS IS -- REALLY HILTS SO

1308
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000

00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
AND THESE BEAUTIFUL, YOUNG

1310
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
ANGELS WHO HAD SO MUCH TO LIVE

1311
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
FOR.
AND IT SEEMS SO SENSELESS.

1312
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
AND AS I SAID, UNTHINKABLE THAT

1313
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
THIS COULD HAPPEN.

1314
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
BUT IT HAS.

1315
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
AND NOW THE PRESIDENT SAID, YOU

1316
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
KNOW, WE COME TOGETHER, WE WRAP

1317
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
OUR ARMS AROUND THESE FAMILIES

1318
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
AND WE HOLD THEM DEAR AND CLOSE

1319
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
TO OUR HEARTS.

1320
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
AND WE REMEMBER REALLY TO LOVE

1321
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
ONE ANOTHER AND TO LOVE OUR

1322
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
CHILDREN AND TELL THEM THAT AND

1323
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
HUG THEM EVERY DAY.

1324
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
SO THAT THEY KNOW THE DEPTH OF

1325
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
FEELING.
AND IT IS -- WHAT AN ENORMOUS

1326
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
TRAGEDY.

1327
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
NOT JUST FOR CONNECTICUT BUT FOR

1328
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

1329
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
>> IT REALLY HAS BROUGHT OUT AN

1330
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
INCREDIBLE PERSONAL SORROW IN SO

1331
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE CONNECTED TO

1332
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
THIS, WHETHER THEY BE SEASONED

1333
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
JOURNALISTS WHO HAVE SPENT 25

1334
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
YEARS OWN AND SEEN IT ALL, OR A

1335
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
CONGRESSWOMAN LIKE YOURSELF.

1336
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
MANY OF US ARE PARENTS.

1337
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I MYSELF AM A PARENT OF TWO

1338
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
SMALL CHILDREN.

1339
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
THEY GO TO SCHOOL AT AN

1340
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ABOUT 25
MINUTES AWAY FROM HERE.

1341
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
THIS HAS BEEN AN OVERWHELMING

1342
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
DAY FOR MANY PEOPLE.

1343
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I WANT TO ASK IF YOU'VE BEEN IN

1344
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
CONTACT WITH THE PRESIDENT OR

1345
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
ANY OF THE AUTHORITIES WHO MAY

1346
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
BE ABLE TO LEND A HAND TO THIS

1347
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
COMMUNITY AND AVAIL THEMSELVES

1348
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
NEED IN THE DAYS AND MONTHS

1351
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
>> WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH

1352
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.

1353
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
AS THE PRESIDENT SAID, THAT HE

1354
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
HAS BEEN IN TOUCH WITH GOVERNOR

1355
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
MALLOY.

1356
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
AND HE SAID THAT, YOU KNOW,

1357
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
WHATEVER SERVICES CONNECTICUT

1358
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
NEEDS WILL BE AVAILABLE AND THE

1359
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
GOVERNOR AS WELL TALKED ABOUT,

1360
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
AGAIN, HOW WE WILL EMBRACE THESE

1361
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
FAMILIES.
AND I KNOW THE ENTIRE DELEGATION

1362
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
FEELS THAT WAY.

1363
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
AND SENATOR DODD WAS HERE THIS

1364
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000

1366
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
AND SO THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS

1367
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT.

1368
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
AND EACH IN OUR OWN WAY WILL TRY

1369
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
TO ACCESS THE SERVICES THAT

1370
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
THESE FAMILIES WILL NEED.

MUELLER.

1421
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I OFFERED GOVERNOR MALLOY MY

1422
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
CONDOLENCES ON BEHALF OF THE

00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000

00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
HAVE EVERY SINGLE RESOURCE THAT

1425
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
HE NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THIS

1426
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
HEINOUS CRIME, CARE FOR THE

00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000

1428
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
WE'VE ENDURED TOO MANY OF THESE

1429
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.

1430
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
AND EACH TIME I LEARN THE NEWS,

1431
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I REACT NOT AS A PRESIDENT BUT

1432
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
AS ANYBODY ELSE WOULD.

1433
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000

00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I KNOW THERE'S NOT A PARENT IN

AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

1438
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I

1439
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
DO.

1440
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

1441
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN --

1442
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
>> WE'VE BEEN GETTING UPDATES

1443
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000

AND OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS THAT WE

1452
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
UTILIZE.

1453
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
EVEN SOME OUT-OF-STATE PARTNERS

1454
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
WILL HELP US REACH OUT OF STATE

1455
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
IF ANYTHING CROSSES THE STATE

1456
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
BORDERS.

1457
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME.

1458
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
WE WILL BE PROCESSING THIS

1459
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000

00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000

1463
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
GIVEN ACCESS TO THE BODIES OF

1464
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
THE DECEASED CHILDREN?

1465
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
>> NO.

1466
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000

IDENTIFICATIONS?
>> WE HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE

1468
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
THAT WE'RE GOING TO ESTABLISH.

1469
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
WE HAVE A PROCESS ESTABLISHED, I

1470
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
SHOULD SAY, IN PLACE THAT WE'RE

1471
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
GOING TO UTILIZE TO IDENTIFY

1472
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
EACH INDIVIDUAL.

1473
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
>> LIEUTENANT, DO YOU EXPECT

1474
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
THAT -- THE IDENTIFICATION TO

1476
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000

1477
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
WE CAN HAVE POSITIVE I.D.s BY

00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
TOMORROW.
THE PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE

1479
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
TELLING US THAT, SPECIFICALLY

1480
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER AND HIS

1481
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
TEAM, OUR INVESTIGATORS, AND

1482
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
WORKING TOGETHER, WE'RE HOPING

1483
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000

00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
THE OTHER --
>> THE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN

1485
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000

PRELIMINARY IDENTIFICATIONS HAVE

1487
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
BEEN MADE.

1488
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
THROUGH PROCESS OF ELIMINATION,

1489
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
UNFORTUNATELY, THE FAMILIES HAVE

1490
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
BEEN TOLD.
BUT AGAIN, WE WANT TO BE

1491
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY SURE, NO

1492
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
DOUBT WHATSOEVER.

1493
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
>> WE SAW FBI ON THE SCENE

1494
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
EARLIER WHEN IT WAS CRAZY.
>> YES.

1495
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
>> WHAT WAS THEIR ROLE?

1496
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
IS THERE STILL A ROLE FOR THEM

1497
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
RIGHT NOW?

1498
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
>> CERTAINLY THEY'RE WITH US,

1499
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
WORKING WITH US, THEY WERE

1500
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
FEDERAL PARTNERS HERE, FBI, ATF,

ALL OFFERING SERVICES IN ANY

1502
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000

OFFERING ABILITY ACROSS STATE

SIMPLY STATED, EVERYONE'S COME

1505
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
TOGETHER IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

1506
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
COMMUNITY.
THIS IS A MASSIVE INVESTIGATION.

1507
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
SO MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

1508
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
DON'T EVER HAVE TO UNDERTAKE.

RESOURCE WE MIGHT NEED AND WE'RE

1512
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
APPRECIATIVE OF ANY HELP WE'RE

1513
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
GETTING.
>> [ INAUDIBLE ]

INVOLVED, ANY COME MISSION?

1516
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
>> NO, AT THIS POINT IN TIME

1517
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
WE'RE CONFIDENT WE HAVE THE

1518
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
SHOOTER.

1519
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
>> [ INAUDIBLE ] SPECIFIC
CLASSROOM?

1520
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
>> NO, I'D RATHER NOT DO THAT,

1521
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
QUITE FRANKLY.

1522
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I'VE BEEN A TROOPER A LONG TIME

1523
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
AND MY LIEUTENANT TO MY LEFT HAS

1524
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
BEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT A LONG

1525
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
TIME.
IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT SERVES

1526
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
NO USEFUL PURPOSE.

1527
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
IT'S RATHER NOT GET INTO THAT.

1528
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
IT'S A HORRIFIC SCENE.

1529
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
BETWEEN OUR MUTUAL EXPERIENCE,

1530
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
AND WE'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING

1531
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
LIKE THIS, IT'S HEART-WRENCHING

1532
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
FOR US AS IT IS FOR THE

1533
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
FAMILIES.

1534
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I JUST WOULD LIKE TO JUST LEAVE

1535
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
THAT --

1536
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
>> DID THE SHOOTER HAVE A

1537
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
HISTORY WITH THE SCHOOL?

1538
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
DID HE ATTEND THE SCHOOL?

1539
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
>> I THINK WHAT WE'VE GOT TO

1540
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
DO -- WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT.

1541
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE

1542
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
HISTORY.
WE'LL GO BACKWARDS AS FAR AS WE

1543
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
HAVE TO GO IN THIS

1544
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
INVESTIGATION.

1545
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL STUMBLE ON

1546
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
ANSWERS AND WE'LL

1547
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
ANSWERS AND HOPEFULLY NOT

1548
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
DEVELOP MANY MORE QUESTIONS.

1549
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
WE WANT TO BUILD THE PROCESS AND

1550
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
THE STORY.
AN INVESTIGATION IS LIKE A

1551
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
PUZZLE.

1552
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
WE WANT TO FORM A COMPLETE

1553
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
PICTURE SO THAT ANYONE CAN TRULY

1554
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT OCCURRED.

1555
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT KEY

1556
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000

AS WE PREPARE THE LIST OF

1561
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
POSITIVE IDENTIFICATIONS, I WANT

1562
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
TO DO ONE LIST.

1563
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
NOT A PIECE MEAL.

1564
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
NOT A COUPLE HERE AND A COUPLE

1565
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
THERE.
ONE FINAL LIST.

1566
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
THE MINUTE THAT'S DONE, WE WILL

00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
BE HERE WITH IT AND ALSO POST IT

00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
GET THEM HOME AND AS MANY OUT AS

KICKED IN.

1581
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU TRAIN FOR

1582
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
AND PLAN FOR.

1583
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
YOU WORK TOWARDS AND HOPE TO

1584
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
NEVER HAVE TO USE.

THEIR TRAINING KICKED IN AND

1586
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
THEY SAVED A LOT OF LIVES AND

1587
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
DID A GREAT JOB.

1588
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
>> CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE

1589
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
SHOOTER?

1590
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE

1591
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
SHOOTER?
>> I WOULD RATHER DO THAT IN THE

IDENTIFICATION EVEN OF THE

1594

WHAT DID THEY SAY OR WHAT WAS

1614
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000

>> I'M NOT SURE.

YES, I BELIEVE SO, BUT I DON'T

1623
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
KNOW HOW MANY.

1624

DIFFERENT LOCATIONS MENTIONED,

1629
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
BUT NOTE TO READ INTO THAT.

1630
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
IF THERE IS SOMETHING

1631
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
SIGNIFICANT ABOUT REACHING OVER

1632

A STATE LINE OR DOING SOMETHING

1633
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
THAT MAY BE RELATED TO THE CASE,

1634
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
WE ARE NOT GOING TO HIDE IT.

1635
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000

THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING

1641
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
