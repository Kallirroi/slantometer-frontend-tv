RICE WANTS OUT.

23

SHE ASKED NOT TO BE CONSIDERED

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
FOR SECRETARY OF STATE.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
THAT WILL PUSH HER INVOLVEMENT

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
IN LIBYA RIGHT UNDER THE RUG.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000

THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
IS JOINING THE FIGHT.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
CAN THEY FRO OUR MARINE FROM

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
OTHER THAN THE PARENTS WANT TO

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
KNOW WHY THAT WAS ALLOWED TO

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
HAPPEN.
TOUGH LOVE OR BASKETBALL BEAT

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
DOWN.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
THEY DEFINITELY LOST.

>> Gretchen: NO, HE DOESN'T.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
HE IS NOT A FAIR WEATHER FAN.

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I LIKE THAT.

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
HE HAS CONVICTION AND SAYS

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000

PARTY IS COMING UP AND WE'LL

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
ALL BE OUT OF FOCUS.

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
>> Brian: IAN ACCORDING TO

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
REPORTS WILL NOT BE GOING.

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
>> Gretchen: WHY ?

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
>> IT IS HANUKKAH.

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
>> Steve: HE HAS A CONFLICT.

84
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
WE'LL START ABOUT THIS.

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
ARE WE SPEAKING OF FOCUS IT IS

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
BECOMING CLEARER, SUSAB RICE

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
WILL NOT BE OUR NEXT SECRETARY

88
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
OF STATE.
>> Brian: I WOULD LIKE TO WITH

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
DRAW MINE AS WELL.

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
>> Steve: SHE SAID ESSENTIALLY

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
THE ADMINISTRATION CAN'T

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
AFFORD A FIGHT OVER BENGHAZI.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
THE BIG QUESTION IS, DID SHE

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
FALL ON HER SWORD OR DID THE

95
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
WHITE HOUSE HAND HER ONE.

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
CLEARLY SHE WAS THROWN UNDER

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
THE BUS.
>> Gretchen: THIS IS WHAT SHE

98
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
WROTE ON SEPTEMBER 16TH WHEN

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
SECRETARY OF STATE WAS

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
UNAVAILABLE AFTER A GRUELING

101
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
WEEK, THE WHITE HOUSE ASKED ME

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
TO APPEAR ON FIVE SUNDAY TALK

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
SHOWS.

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I RELIED ON FULLY CLEARED

105
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
UNCLASSIFIED POINTS PROVIDED

106
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.

107
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
THE UNCLASSIFIED POINTS WERE

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFIED

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
ASSESSMENTS, I RECEIVED.

110
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
FIRST OF ALL WAS HILLARY

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
CLINTON REALLY NOT AVAILABLE

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
OR DID SHE SAY SHE DIDN'T WANT

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
TO GO TELL SOMETHING THAT WAS

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
NOT THE TRUTH.

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
AS KATHERINE HERITAGE, UN

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
AMBASSADOR RICE HAD ACCESS TO

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THE PDP.

118
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
PRESIDENTIAL DAILY BRIEFING

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
BEFORE SHE WENT OUT ON THE

120
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
TALK SHOW AND TALKED ABOUT THE

121
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
FACT THAT IT WAS PROBABLY A

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
TERRORIST ATTACK.

123
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
>> Brian: CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
SAID NOW THAT RICE IS OUT AND

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
THE PRESIDENT DECIDED NOT TO

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
FIGHT THE FIGHT HERE.

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
IT MINES THE END OF PURSUING

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THE TRUTH WITH THE BENGHAZI

129
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
ATTACK.
>> CLEARLY HAD SHE BEEN

130
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
NOMINATED THE BENGHAZI SCANDAL

131
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
WOULD BE ON THE FRONT PAGE.

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I THINK IT WILL DIE NOW IN THE

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
MAIN STREAM MEDIA.

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
THEY HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE

135
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
STORY.

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I THINK HE WOULD RATHER HAVE

137
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
HAD HER AND HE HAD YIELDED .

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
HER CONSOLATION WILL BE HE

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
WILL MAKE HER NATIONAL ADVISOR

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
AND THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE

141
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
ASSET -- ASCENT OF THE SENATE.

142
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
>> Steve: WHEN YOU LOOK AT HER

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
RECORD ON SYRIA AND AFRICA, IT

144
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
WAS NOT GOOD.

145
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
MAUREEN DOWD SAID RICE IS TOO

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
AUTOMATICBITIOUS AND

147
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
UNPRINCIPLED.
DANA MILBANK SAID HER ATTITUDE

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
WAS A PROBLEM .

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
HILLARY CLINTON BEGIN THE

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
CHOICE BETWEEN JOHN KERRY AND

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
SUSAN RICE.

152
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
SAID I WOULD RATHER HAVE JOHN

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
KERRY.

154
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
HE CAN TALK FOR HOURS AND NOT

155
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
SAY ANYTHING AND SPEAKS

156
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
FRENCH.

157
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
>> Gretchen: I WAS DOING

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
STUDIO B .

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
AND HE WAS PROBABLY UNCORKING

160
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
THE CHAMPAGNE.

161
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
THERE IS SUPPOSEDLY A REPORT

162
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
ON BENGHAZI COMING OUT.

163
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
USUALLY THEY MAKE THE

164
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
ANNOUNCEMENTS ON FRIDAY.

165
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
COULD IT BE THE REPORT IS

166
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
COMING OUT TODAY AS THE FRIDAY

167
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
RELEASE OR SOMETIME SOON?

168
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
WILL THAT MEAN HILLARY CLINTON

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
WILL NOT TESTIFY ON DECEMBER

170
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
20TH IF SHE WANTS TO RUN FOR

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
PRESIDENT, AND MODERATE

172
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
REPUBLICAN SUSAN COLLINS, THE

173
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
SENATOR, MAYBE SHE WAS THE

174
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
FINAL NAIL IN THE COFFIN.

175
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
WHEN SHE CAME OUT AND SAID SHE

176
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
STILL HAD QUESTIONS.

177
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
IF MODERATE REPUBLICANS WOULD

178
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
NOT SAY YES, IT WAS OVER.

179
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
>> Brian: I DON'T AGREE WITH

180
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.

181
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I - A LOT OF NAVE I SEALS AND

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
MILITARY PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW

183
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
WHY THEY WERE SACRIFICED.

184
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
AN DREA MITCHELL HAS A

185
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
STAGGERING REVIEW WHAT THIS

186
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
MEANS FOR REPUBLICANS THAT

187
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
AMBASSADOR RICE WAS NOT

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
NOMINATED.
>> I THINK IT WAS AN

189
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGE FOR HER

FEELINGS TOWARD BLOOMINGTON

1144
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
SOUTH.
THE WAY WE LOOK AT IT NOW OUR

1145
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
GIRL'S BASKETBALL PROGRAM IS AT

1146
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
THE VERY BEGINNING STAGES OF

1147
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
DEVELOPMENT.

1148
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
WE CURRENTLY HAVE TEN GIRLS IN

1149
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
THE WHOLE PROGRAM.
SIX OF THOSE TEN ARE PLAYING

1150
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
BASKETBALL ALL TOGETHER FOR THE

1151
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIFE.

1152
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I'M NOT TALKING BEING ON A TEAM,

1153
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
REALLY JUST PLAYING THE GAME FOR

1154
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
THE FIRST TIME.

1155
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
BLOOMINGTON SOUTH, YEAR IN AND

1156
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
YEAR OUT IS A STATE POWER.

1157
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
CURRENTLY THEY'RE 8-1.

1158
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
RANKED NUMBER 10 IN THE STATE.

1159
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
SO WE DEFINITELY -- WE JUST SEE

1160
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
IT AS TWO PROGRAMS THAT ARE

1161
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
ABOUT ON POLAR OPPOSITE ENDS IN

1162
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
THE SPECTRUM.

1163
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
>> Brian: I WOULD SAY SO, BUT I

1164
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF TEAMS

1165
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER THAN THEIR

1166
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
OPPONENTS.
THEY DON'T WIN BY 105 POINTS.

1167
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
WOULD YOU BE DISPINT FUNDAMENTAL

1168
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
A TEAM UNDER INJURE JURISDICTION

1169
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
WON BY 105?

1170
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
WOULD YOU ANGRY AT THAT COACH?

1171
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
>> WELL, I MEAN, WE TRUST

1172
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
BLOOMINGTON SOUTH AND THEY'RE

1173
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
COACHING STAFF ABOUT ALL THEY

1174
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
COULD OUTRIGHT KEEP THE

1175
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
INTEGRITY AND THE SPORTSMANSHIP

1176
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
THE BEST THEY CAN.

1177
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE THINGS THAT

1178
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
YOU CAN DO, LIKE TAKING PRESS

1179
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
PRESTONS OFF AND WE FEEL THEY

1180
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
DID A DECENT JOB OF.

1181
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
>> Brian: WOW.

1182
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
>> WE DON'T HOLD ANY HARD

1183
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
FEELINGS TOWARD THEM.

1184
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
WE LOOK AT IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY

1185
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
FOR OUR GIRLS TO SEE IF A

1186
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
PROGRAM LIKE BLACKTON SOUTH,

1187
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
ENTRY THEY ARE.
>> Brian: THEY SAW A LOT OF THAT

1188
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
PROGRAM.

1189
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
HERE IS WHAT THE COACH SAID.

1190
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
BOTH TEAMS PLAYED HARD.

1191
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
TO DO ANYTHING LESS BY EITHER

1192
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
TEAM WOULD HAVE BEEN DEMEANING.

1193
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
ARLINGTON CAME OUT AND WORKED ON

1194
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
THEIR PLAYER DEVELOPMENT AS DID

1195
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
WE.
THE LONG STANDING REPUTATION OF

1196
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
OUR PROGRAM AND COACH IS ONE

1197
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
THAT WOULD VALIDATE THIS

1198
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
INFORMATION.
SAYING IT WOULD BE MORE OF AN

1199
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
INSULT IF WE STOPPED SHOOTING.

1200
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

1201
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
>> TO A CERTAIN EX AT ANY TIME,

1202
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
YEAH.
I MEAN, AGAIN, WHERE DO YOU DRAW

1203
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
THAT LINE OF TRYING NOT TO SCORE

1204
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
AS MOCKING THE OPPONENT AND

1205
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
EMBARRASSING THEM?

1206
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I THINK ONE THING YOU COULD LOOK

1207
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
AT IS THE CHARACTER OF OUR YOUNG

1208
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
LEADERS.
THAT SCORE BOARD IS UP THERE ALL

1209
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
NIGHT FOR 32 MINUTES AND JUST

1210
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
LIKE THE PEOPLE SAID, OUR GIRLS

1211
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
PLAYED HARD TORE 32 MINUTES.

1212
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
IT'S EASY FOR THEM.

1213
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
>> Brian:   THE COACH OF YOUR

1214
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
TEAM SAID THEY COULD HAVE SHOWN

1215
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
BETTER RESPONSEMANSHIP.

1216
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I THINK THAT'S THE LEAST, DON'T

1217
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
YOU THINK.

1218
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
>> AFTER A LOSS LIKE THAT, YOU

1219
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
SPEAK -- WE'RE TAKING IT AS

1220
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
WE'RE JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON US

1221
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
AND OUR GIRLS BASKETBALL

1222
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
PROGRAM.
WE'RE EXTREMELY PROUD OF THEM

1223
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
AND THE EFFORT THEY GAVE THAT

1224
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
NIGHT AND THE FACT THAT THEY

1225
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
DIDN'T QUIT.
THEY'RE A RESILIENT GROUP OF

1226
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
YOUNG LADIES.

1227
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
WE'RE NOT FOCUSED ON THE

1228
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
NEGATIVE.
>> Brian: YOU GOT TO MAYBE GET

1229
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
TOGETHER WITH OTHER ATHLETIC

1230
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
DIRECTORS AND TALK ABOUT THINGS

1231
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
LIKE A MERCY RULE PERHAPS.

1232
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
DOWN BY 50 AT THE HALF.

1233
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
>> RIGHT.
YEAH.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

1234
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
OR POSSIBLY THE IDEA OF RUNNING

1235
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000

1236
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000

1237

I WANT YOU TO STOP YOUR GIRLS

What's the rush?

HE DOES IT FOR EXPERIENCE.

WITH ALL THAT EXPERIENCE, MAYBE

1366

HE COULD BECOME SECRETARY OF

THE FAN, WE PREDICTED ON THIS

1388
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
PROGRAM THAT SHE EVENTUALLY

1389
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
WOULD BE WITHDRAWN BECAUSE SHE

1390
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
SIMPLY WAS NOT WORTH THE FIGHT

1391
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000

1396
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
SHE SAID ON SEPTEMBER 16 WHEN

1397
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY

1398
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000

GRUELING WEEK, THE WHITE HOUSE

SHE KNEW THE SECRET STUFF,

1407
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
WHICH ENCAPSULATED THEIR BEST

1408
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
CURRENT ASSESS AM.

1409
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,000
THESE UNCLASSIFIED POINTS

1410
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000

1412
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000

BALL.

1415
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID WHILE I DEEP

1416
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
WILL HE REGREAT THE UNFAIR AND

1417
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
MISLEADING ATTACKS ON AMBASSADOR

1418
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
RICE, IT REFLECTS HER CHARACTER.

1419
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
CHAFFETZ SAYS COINCIDENCE?

1420
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I DON'T THINK SO.

1421
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT OWES US A

1422
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
REPORT.
THAT'S WHY I THINK SUSAN RICE

1423
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
MADE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY.

1424
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE THE

1425
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000

1426
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
THEY'RE SAYING MAYBE WE'LL GIVE

1427
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
YOU A SUMMARY.

1428
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
SECRETARY CLINTON MAY NOT COME

1429
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
UP.
I THINK THE REPORT, IF DONE

1430
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
ACCURATELY, WILL BE A VERY

1431
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
DIFFICULT THING FOR THE WHITE

1432
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
HOUSE, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE

1433
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND THE

1434
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
C.I.A. TO EXPLAIN.

1435
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000

1436
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
MOVING PARTS THAT WERE HAPPENING

1437
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

1438
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
FIRST OF ALL, IT STARTED COMING

1439
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
OUT THAT HILLARY CLINTON MAY BE

1440
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
WOULDN'T TESTIFY ON DECEMBER 20

1441
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
AS PLANNED.

1442
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
MOMENTS LATER, SUSAN RICE TAKES

1443
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
HERSELF OUT OF THE RUNNING.

1444
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS

1445
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
POTENTIALLY THAT THIS REPORT IS

1446
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
COMING OUT, REMEMBER, SUSAN RICE

1447
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
EXTENDED THE OLIVE GRANT AND MET

1448
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
WITH SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM AND

1449
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
JOHN MCCAIN, HER TWO FIERCEST

1450
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
CRITICS.

1451
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
SHE THEN MET WITH SENATOR SUSAN

1452
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
COLLIN A MODERATE.

1453
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
SHE ALSO CAME OUT OF THE MEETING

1454
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
SAYING, I ACTUALLY HAVE MORE

1455
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
QUESTIONS NOW THAN I DID BEFORE.

1456
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
SO IF YOU COULDN'T GET THE

1457
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
MODERATE REPUBLICAN TO VOTE FOR

1458
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
YOU FOR SECRETARY OF STATE, THE

1459
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
WRITING WAS PROBABLY ON THE

1460
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
WALL.

1461
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
>> Brian: WHAT I THOUGHT WAS

1462
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
TOTALLY OUT OF BOUNDS WITH

1463
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
ANDREA MITCHELL SAID YESTERDAY

1464
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
IN HER EVALUATION AND ANALYZING

1465
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
WHAT THIS MEANS IN TERMS OF

1466
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
POLITICS WITH HER BACKING OUT,

1467
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
SHE BROUGHT UP THE GENDER FACTOR

1468
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
AND THE RACE FACTOR.

1469
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
LISTEN.
>> I THINK THAT THIS HAD BECOME

1470
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
SORT OF AN IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGE

1471
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
FOR HER TO BE CONFIRMED.

1472
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
SHE REALIZED THAT.

1473
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
THE WHITE HOUSE REALIZED IT AS

1474
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
WELL.
I THINK THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE

1475
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
ON GOOD POLITICAL, SOLID GROUND,

1476
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
AS YOU WERE POINTING OUT.

1477
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
THIS IS NOT GOING TO HEPARINS AT

1478
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
ALL, THE FACT THAT A WOMAN AND A

1479
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
WOMAN OF COLOR HAS BEEN FORCED

1480
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
OUT OF THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS

1481
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
BEFORE SHE WAS NOMINATED.

1482
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
>> Gretchen: NOTHING TO DO WITH
IT.

1483
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
>> Steve: LOOK, IT WAS GEORGE W

1484
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
BUSH, A REPUBLICAN, WHO PLACED

1485
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
IN THE JOB OF SECRETARY OF STATE

1486
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
A WOMAN OF COLOR, CONDOLEEZA

1487
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
RICE.
WE HAVE SEEN THIS A LOT, THIS

1488
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
KIND OF TALK FROM THE LEFT OVER

1489
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.

1490
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
>> Gretchen: IT'S INTERESTING

1491
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
BECAUSE IF ANYONE IS A PROPONENT

1492
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
OF WOMEN SEEKING OFFICE IT'S ME.

1493
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I DON'T AGREE WITH ANDREA

1494
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
MITCHELL AT ALL ON THIS.

1495
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT RECENT

1496
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
SECRETARY OF STATES, A LOT HAVE

1497
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
BEEN WOMEN AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN.

1498
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
YOU HAVE MADELEINE ALBRIGHT,

1499
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
HILLARY CLINTON, CONDOLEEZA

1500
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
RICE, I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE

1501
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
LAST MALE.
THEN YOU BROUGHT IT UP THAT IT

1502
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
WAS COLIN POWELL.

1503
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I'M NOT SURE IT HAS ANYTHING O

1504
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
DO WITH WHY SUSAN RICE WILL NOT

1505
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
BE SECRETARY OF STATE.

1506
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
>> Steve: IT ABSOLUTELY DOES

1507
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
NOT.

1508
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
SHE WENT OUT AND MANY PEOPLE

1509
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
FEEL SHE LIED TO THE AMERICAN

1510
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
PEOPLE TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT OF

1511
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
THE UNITED STATES POLITICAL

1512
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
COVER JUST BEFORE AN ELECTION.

1513
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
>> Brian: 17 DAYS AND THREE DAYS

1514
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
TO WRITE LEGISLATION.

1515
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
PROBABLY LESS THAN 17 DAYS 'TIL

1516
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
WE HIT THE FISCAL CLIFF.

1517
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
THE PRESIDENT INVITED THE

1518
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
SPEAKER TO THE WHITE HOUSE

1519
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
YESTERDAY AND OUR E-MAIL BOX,

1520
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
WE'RE GETTING FILLED UP.

1521
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
THERE COMES THE SPEAKER AND

1522
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
THERE GOES THE SPEAKER.

1523
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
IT LASTED AN HOUR AND 15

1524
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
MINUTES.
DID ANYTHING GET IRONED OUT?

1525
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
SO FAR INSIDERS SAY NO.

1526
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
YAO GOLDBERG OFFERED THIS

1527
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
ANALYSIS AND IT WAS PRETTY

1528
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
BRILLIANT.

1529
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
>> I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT

1530
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S POSITION IS

1531
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
LIKE MICHAEL CORLEONE'S POSITION

1532
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
IN GODFATHER 2, MY OFFER IS

1533
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
NOTHING.

1534
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
HIS REAL GOAL IS WATCH THE

1535
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
REPUBLICAN PARTY GO UP IN FLAMES

1536
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
AND EAT THEMSELVES ALIVE.

1537
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
WHICH SO FAR SEEMS TO BE

1538
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
WORKING.

1539
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I THINK THAT WHAT BOEHNER TRIED

1540
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
TO DO AT THIS POINT IS SIMPLY

1541
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
TAKE THE MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUTS

1542
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
AS PERMANENT,  WHICH WOULD BE A

1543
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
HUGE CONSERVATIVE VICTORY, EAT

1544
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
IT ON THE RAISING THE TOP RATES,

1545
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
AND THEN LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER

1546
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
DAY.

1547
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
>> Steve: OKAY.
SO THAT'S JONAH GOLDBERG'S

1548
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
OPINION, THAT MR. BOEHNER SHOULD

1549
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
CAVE AND SAY OKAY, LET'S GO

1550
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
AHEAD AND RAISE UP RATES.

1551
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
YESTERDAY IN THEIR VERY BRIEF

1552
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
CONVERSATION LESS THAN AN HOUR,

1553
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
APPARENTLY THE PRESIDENT -- I'M

1554
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
GOING TO PARAPHRASE WHAT WE

1555
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
KNOW -- THE PRESIDENT SAID OKAY,

1556
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
JOHN, YOU READY TO CAVE?

1557
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
HE SAID NOPE, I'M NOT GOING TO

1558
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
RAISE TAXES ON ANYBODY.

1559
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
HOW THAT LASTED AN HOUR, I DON'T

1560
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
KNOW.

1561
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
>> Gretchen: BECAUSE IT REALLY

1562
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
COMES DOWN TO WHETHER OR NOT THE

1563
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
PRESIDENT IS ALSO GOING TO AGREE

1564
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
TO SPENDING CUTS.

1565
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
REMEMBER, FOLKS, ABOUT TWO YEARS

1566
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
AGO HE SAID THAT HE WAS IN FAVOR

1567
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
OF RAISING THE AGE OF MEDICARE

1568
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
TO 67 FROM 65.

1569
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
SO WHERE HAS THAT PRESIDENT

1570
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
GONE?
NOW AT A MOST CRUCIAL MOMENT

1571
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
WHEN LET'S FACE IT, IN ORDER TO

1572
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
GET A DEAL DONE, BOTH SIDES ARE

1573
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE IN ON

1574
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
STUFF THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO

1575
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
GIVE IN ON.

1576
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
IF THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL, OR

1577
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
THE OTHER OPTION IS JUST GO OVER

1578
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
THE CLIFF.
>> Steve: THE PROBLEM IS, DICK

1579
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
DURBIN SAID YESTERDAY VERY

1580
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
CLEARLY, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
ARE WE GOING TO RAISE THE

1581
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
MEDICARE RETIREMENT AGE.

1582
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
NANCY PELOSI ESSENTIALLY SAID

1583
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

1584
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
SO TWO OF THE STRONGEST PEOPLE

1585
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
IN THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE SAY

1586
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
NO TO THE PRESIDENT, THERE IS

1587
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
NOT A LOT OF WIGGLE ROOM THERE.

1588
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
>> Brian: THE PRESIDENT DID A

1589
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
MORNING SHOW INTERVIEW YESTERDAY

1590
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
ON THE WEST COAST AND SAID THAT

1591
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
JOHN BOEHNER WAS TOO CONCERNED

1592
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
ABOUT RAISING TAX, ABOUT WHAT

1593
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
REPUBLICANS WOULD SAY IF HE

1594
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
RAISED TAXES.

1595
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
>> Steve: IT CONTINUES.

1596
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
>> Gretchen: FOX NEWS ALERT NOW,

1597
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
TWO LARGE BACK TO BACK QUAKES

1598
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
SHAKING THE CALIFORNIA COAST

1599
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
THIS MORNING.

1600
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
6.4 MAGNITUDE QUAKE ROCKED THE

1601
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000

01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

1603
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
MOMENTS LATER, A 6.1 QUAKE

1604
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
STRUCK, SHAKING SAN DIEGO AND

1605
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
LOS ANGELES.

1606
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
SO FAR NO REPORTS OF ANY DAMAGE

1607
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
OR INJURY.

1608
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
>>> THE UNITED STATES RAMPING UP

1609
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
ITS INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRISIS IN

1610
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000

TROOPS TO TURKEY.

1615
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
THAT'S TO HELP BEEF UP THE

1616
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
COUNTRY'S DEFENSE AGAINST

1617
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
POTENTIAL SYRIAN ATTACKS.

1618
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
THE MISSILES WILL BE UNDER NATO

1619
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
CONTROL.

1620
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
>>> TODAY'S DECISION DEADLINE
FOR STATES TO DECIDE IF THEY'RE

1621
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
GOING TO SET UP THEIR OWN

1622

1628
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
SIX STATES PLAN ON SPLITTING IT

1629
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
WITH THE FEDS.

1630
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
UTAH AND FLORIDA ARE THE ONLY IT

1631
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
WHO HAVE NOT MADE A DECISION.

1632
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
>>> TALK ABOUT DIVINE

1633
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
INTERVENTION, CHECK THIS OUT.

1634
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
TWO THIEVES LEARNING A PAINFUL

1635
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
LESSON WHILE TRYING TO ROB A

1636
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
CHURCH IN HOUSTON.

1637
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
THEY TRIED GRABBING THE ELECTRIC

1638
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
CABLE, LIKELY FOR ITS COPPER.

1639
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
AND SET OFF THIS EXPLOSION.

1640
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
COPS SAY THESE GUYS WON'T BE

1641
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
HARD TO FIND.

1642
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
THEIR INJURIES SHOULD BE A GIVE

1643

1779
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
>> IT SHOULD BE.
KEEP IN MIND, AMERICANS FOR

1780
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
PROSPERITY HAD TO GET PERMITS TO

1781
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
PUT THIS TENT UP.
THEY ACTUALLY RESERVED THAT

1782
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000

THEY HAD ELECTRICITY THERE.

1783
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
SO THEY WENT THROUGH THE PROPER

1784
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000

1786
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
AND THE TENT WAS TORN DOWN AND I

1787
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
HAVE SEEN OTHER VIDEOS, NOT JUST

1788
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000

1789
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000

I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IF

1802

1816

BUT I THINK THE QUESTION THAT A

1819
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
LOT OF FOLKS BROUGHT UP IS WHAT

1820
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
WOULD HAPPEN IF IT WERE

1821
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
REVERSED?

1822
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
IF IT WERE A TEA PARTY MEMBER.

1823
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
>> Steve: OH, MY GOODNESS.

1824
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
>> RIGHT.
REMEMBER A COUPLE YEARS AGO, THE

1825
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
ALLEGATION THAT A TEA PARTY

1826
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,000
PROTESTER USED A RACIAL EPITAPH

1827
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
RODE THEM FOR DAYS AND THIS WAS

1828
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
JUST AN ALLEGATION THAT SOMEBODY

1829
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
SAID SOMETHING.

1830
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
HERE SOMEBODY HAS PUNCHED

1831
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
SOMEBODY IN THE FACE.

1832
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
THIS IS CLEAR, IF THIS WERE

1833
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
REVERSED, THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA

1834
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
WOULD BE PLAYING THE VIDEO

1835
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
INCESSANTLY.

1836
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
NUMBER TWO, YOU WOULD START TO

1837
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
SEE CONSERVATIVES COME OUT AND

1838
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
CONDEMN THE VIOLENCE AND

1839
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
CRITICIZE A -- THEY WOULD

1840
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
ACTUALLY TURN ON THE TEA PARTY

1841
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
GUY, NOT DEFEND HIM.
BUT I THINK THIRDLY, IT WOULD

1842
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
BECOME PART OF A LARGER

1843
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
NARRATIVE, RIGHT?

1844
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
SO IF THE TEA PARTY HAD DONE

1845
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
THIS, IT WOULD BE, WELL -- MITT

1846
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
ROMNEY NEEDS TO COMMENT ON THIS.

1847
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
OR PART OF THE WAR ON WOMEN.

1848
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
AND THAT CERTAINLY HASN'T

1849
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
HAPPENED.
THERE ARE THINGS THAT DEMOCRATS

1850
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
AND I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA GAVE

1851
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
A SPEECH.
THERE WAS A DEMOCRATIC

1852
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
REPRESENTATIVE WHO SAID THERE

1853
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
WILL BE BLOOD.

1854
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
JIMMY HOFFA CAUGHT IN A CIVIL

1855
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
WAR.
ALL THOSE THINGS HAPPENED BEFORE

1856
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
THE VIOLENCE AND YET, NOBODY IS

1857
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
REALLY TYING IT INTO THAT LARGER

1858
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
NARRATIVE.

1859
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
>> Steve: THAT'S RIGHT.
AND ALSO ON THE LEFT, I KNOW A

1860
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE SUGGESTING

1861
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
STEVEN CROWDER ACTUALLY DESERVED

1862
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
GETTING THE BEAT DOWN, WHICH IS

1863
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
CRAZY.
ALL RIGHT.

1864
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
MATT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

>> THANK YOU.
>> Steve: WHAT DO YOU THINK

1868
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
ABOUT THAT?

1869
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
THE DOUBLE STANDARD THAT IS

1870
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000

1872
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
MEANWHILE, STRAIGHT AHEAD, YOU

1873
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
THOUGHT THE TALKS ON THE FISCAL

1874
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
CLIFF WERE BRUTAL?

1875
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

1876
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
LAWMAKERS THROWING FISTS.

1877
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
WHERE THIS HAPPENED, WE'LL TELL

1878
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
YOU COMING UP NEXT.

1879
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
THEN SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T

1880
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
HAPPEN TOO OFTEN, A MOVIE THAT

1881
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
THE WHOLE FAMILY COULD SEE

1882
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
TOGETHER.

THAT YOU WON'T GET.

1886
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
JUST LAUGH.

1887
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
>> HELLO, BOYS.

1888
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
STILL SINGLE?

1889

>> Brian: QUICK HEADLINES.

1898
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
NEW DETAILS ABOUT THE MAN WHO

1899
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
OPENED FIRE INSIDE A CROWDED

1900
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
MALL IN OREGON.

1901
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
JACOB ROBERTS' ROOMMATE SAID HE

1902
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
HAD A WEIRD LOOK ON HIS FACE

1903
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
WHEN HE LEFT THE HOUSE THAT DAY.

1904
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
ROBERTS SHOT AND KILLED TWO

1905
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
PEOPLE INSIDE THE MALL BEFORE

1906
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
TURNING THE GUN ON HIMSELF.

1907
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
THE MALL SET TO REOPEN A LITTLE

1908
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
BIT LATER THIS MORNING.

1909
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
>>> COULD JENNY RIVERA HAVE

1910
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
AVOIDED DEATH?

1911
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
IT TURNS OUT SHE MADE A LAST

1912
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
MINUTE DECISION TO TAKE THAT

1913
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
DEADLY PLANE RIDE.

1914
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
SHE WAS OFFERED A ROOM FOR THE

1915
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:16,000
NIGHT, BUT TOOK OFF TO HER NEXT

1916
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000

>> THIS IS PIXIE RIGHT HERE AND

1928
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
THIS IS TWIGGY.

1929
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:46,000
>> Brian: THESE PUPPIES?

1930
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
>> TWINKIE.
>> Gretchen: SHE COULD BE

1931
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
TWIGGY, YEAH.

1932
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
>> IS A YORKIE.

1933
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
SHE'S BLIND.

1934
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
AND THIS IS PIXIE.

1935
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE

1936
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
IS.

1937
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
>> Steve: THIS IS THE TIME OF

1938
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
SEASON WHEN I KNOW YOU GUYS TRY

1939
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT

1940
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
THESE DOGS DON'T WIND UP STAYING

1941
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
IN A KENNEL OVER CHRISTMAS.

1942
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY WE CAN ADOPT

1943
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
THEM OUT AND OTHERS?

1944
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
THERE ARE THOUSANDS ACROSS THE

1945
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
COUNTRY.
>> THE FIRST THING IS CHRISTMAS

1946
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
IS MAYBE NOT THE BEST TIME.

1947
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
IT'S FUN, THERE IS A LOT GOING

1948
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
ON.

1949
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
BUT IF YOU PLAN A LOT OF STUFF

1950
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
AHEAD OF TIME AND YOU'RE ALL

1951
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
PREPARED.
BUT I THINK THAT -- IT'S REALLY

1952
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
HARD.
THE ADOPTION RATES ARE SUPER

1953
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
DOWN RIGHT NOW.

1954
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
>> Steve: WHY IS THAT?

1955
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
>> ECONOMY.

1956
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
>> Steve: YEAH.
AT THE CAN'T FEED THEMSELVES,

1957
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
HOW CAN THEY FEED THE DOGS?

1958
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
>> BUT YOU JUST GO TO THE

1959
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
SHELTER AND GO TO PETFINDER.COM

1960
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,000
AND PICK A BREED.

1961
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
START LOOK.

1962
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
>> Gretchen: TWINKIE, HOW DID

1963
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
SHE BECOME BLIND?

1964
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
>> SHE WAS BORN THAT WAY.

1965
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
>> Gretchen: SHE'S SHAKING.

1966
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
IS SHE COLD OR JUST SCARED?

1967
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
>> SCARED.

1968
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
SHE HAD A ROUGH TRIP.

1969
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
>> Gretchen: OKAY.

1970
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
>> Brian: I BELIEVE THAT PIXIE

1971
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:57,000
IS A CHIHUAHUA PEKINESE.

1972
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
COULD THAT BE A GUESS?

1973
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
>> YEAH.
THIS ONE CAME FROM A BREEDER WHO

1974
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
CAST HER OFF BECAUSE SHE WAS

1975
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
BLIND.

1976
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
>> Steve: SO MANY PEOPLE DO, FOR

1977
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
ONE REASON OR ANOTHER, THEY

1978
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
DON'T HAVE A DID YOU GO AND THEY

1979
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
THINK SOME DAY I'M GOING TO GO

1980
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
TO THE PET SHOP AND BUY ONE.

1981
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ANIMALS AT

1982
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
AMERICA'S SHELTERS THAT ARE SO

1983
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
EASY AND SO NEEDING A HOME.

1984
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
>> GRATEFUL.

1985
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
>> Steve: THEY ARE GRATEFUL.

1986
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
THEY'RE GREAT DOGS.

1987
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
>> YOU CAN GET ANY BREED YOU

1988
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
WANT IN RESCUE.

1989
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
>> Steve: SOMETIMES IT TAKES A

1990
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
LITTLE WHILE TO FIND THE ONE YOU

1991
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
WANT.

1992
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
>> YES, YOU CAN.

1993
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
>> Brian: HOW LONG HAVE THEY

1994
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
BEEN GETTING ALONG LIKE THIS?

1995
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
>> BLIND?

1996
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
>> Brian: NO, THEY GET ALONG

1997
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
WELL.
THEY'RE NOT FIGHTING OR

01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
WHEELCHAIR AND THEY DID NOTHING.

2176
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
THEN THAT'S WHEN IT JUST SEEMED

2177
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
TO -- EVERYTHING SEEMED TO

2178
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
SPIRAL OUT.

2179
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
>> Steve: AFTER 45 MINUTES, SHE

2180
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
WAS FREE TO GO.

2181
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
AGENTS GAVE THE FAMILY NO

2182
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
EXPLANATION AND NO APOLOGY.

2183
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
HEART BREAK VIDEO.

2184
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
>> Gretchen: POLITICIANS

2185
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
REACHING ACROSS THE AISLE.

2186
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
OKAY, NOW YOU THINK IS GOING TO

2187
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
BE GOOD NEWS?

2188
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
NO, THEY REACH ACROSS THE AISLE

2189
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,000
TO THROW PUNCHES.

2190
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
THEY SAY WE NEED MORE OF THIS IN

2191
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
AMERICA, BUT THIS IS THE FIRST

2192
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
SESSION OF UKRAINE'S NEWLY

2193
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
ELECTED PARLIAMENT.

2194
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
THE MASSIVE BRAWL STARTED WHEN

2195
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
LAWMAKERS BURST TO THE FRONT OF

2196
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
THE CHAMBER AND FOUGHT OVERT

2197
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
VOTE FOR A NEW PRIME MINISTER

2198
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
AND SPEAKER.

2199
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I DON'T KNOW, JOHN, YOU MAY BE

2200
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
UP TO SOMETHING.

2201
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
ALL THESE SECRET MEETINGS

2202
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
BETWEEN BAINER AND OBAMA,

2203
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
THEY'VE GONE NOWHERE.

2204
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
MAYBE IF THEY DUKE IT OUT LIKE

2205
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
IN A HOCKEY GAME, MAYBE WE GET

2206
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
SOMETHING SOLVED.

2207
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
>> Steve: THEY'RE NOT BLUE OR

2208
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
RED.
THEY'RE BLACK AND BLUE,

2209
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
ACCORDING TO THOSE PEOPLE.

2210
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
MEANWHILE, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS,

2211
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
WERE YOU ABLE TO SEE THIS

2212
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
MORNING'S METEOR SHOWER?

2213
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
WE TOLD BUT THIS YESTERDAY.

2214
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
THIS IS A SHOT OF THE STREAK

2215
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,000
SEEN ABOVE THE DESERT IN ISRAEL.

2216
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
IT TAKES PLACE ONLY A SHORT TIME

2217
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:10,000
AGO.
AS MANY AS 50, AS YOU CAN SEE,

2218
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
METEORS PER HOUR WERE SAID TO BE

2219
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
SEEN.

2220
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
>> Brian: ANYONE HURT?

2221
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
>> Steve: NO, THEY'RE FINE.

2222
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
DON'T KNOW ABOUT SPACE, THOUGH.

2223
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
BUT IN SPACE, NOBODY CAN HEAR

2224
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
YOU SCREAM.

2225
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
HERE IS ANOTHER LOOK ABOVE

2226
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
TYLER, TEXAS.

2227
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
NASA SAYS THAT THIS YEAR'S SHOW

2228
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,000
COULD BE THE BEST AS THE MOON'S

2229
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
GLARE WON'T INTERFERE WITH

2230
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
VISIBILITY.
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

2231
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
MEANWHILE, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT

2232
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
WHERE IT IS RAINING.

2233
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T SEE MUCH IN

2234
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
TEXAS BECAUSE THE CLOUD COVER.

2235
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
ALSO BACK THROUGH PORTIONS OF

2236
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
ARIZONA, NEW MEXICO AND SOUTHERN

2237
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
CALIFORNIA, SHOWERY THERE.

2238
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
A LITTLE BIT OF SNOW ACTIVITY

01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
EARLY ON THIS FRIDAY UP ALONG

2240
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000

2241
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000

2242
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
20S IN THE NORTHERN PLAINS.

2243
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
MONTANA NOW, THE CHILLY SPOT ON

2244
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
THIS MAP WITH 13.

2245
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
WE'VE GOT ABOUT 27 IN RALEIGH

2246
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
DURHAM AND LATER TODAY, THINGS

2247
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
WILL WARM UP A LITTLE IN RALEIGH

2248
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
ALMOST 60.

2249
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
THE SAME FOR MEMPHIS.

2250
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
WARM ALONG THE COAST.

2251
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
50S AND 60S AND 60S THROUGH

2252
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
PORTION OF TEXAS.

30S IN THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND

2254
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
PORTIONS OF NEW ENGLAND.

2255
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
>> Gretchen: BRIAN, MY SON IS

2256
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
THE SPORTSCASTER AT SCHOOL

2257
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
TODAY.
SO HE'S PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION

2258
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:20,000
TO SEE WHAT YOU SAY RIGHT NOW.

2259
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
>> Steve: NO PRESSURE.

2260
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
>> Brian: I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE

2261
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
THAT TAPE.
I'M SURE HE'LL DO GREAT.

2262
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
LET'S TALK ABOUT THURSDAY NIGHT

2263
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
FOOTBALL.
LET'S START THERE BECAUSE

2264
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
CINCINNATI AND THE EAGLES LOCKED
IN A GAME THAT CINCINNATI HAD TO

2265
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
WIN TO KEEP THEIR PLAYOFF HOPES

2266
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
ALIVE AND THEY DID.

2267
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
TURNOVERS WERE THE KEY.

2268
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
PHILADELPHIA GAVE THIS GAME

2269
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
AWAY.
FIVE TURNOVERS IN ALL.

2270
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
A MESSY SEASON FOR THEM WHERE

2271
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
THEY UNDERACHIEVE AND THEY'RE

2272
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
HAVING A CHANGE IN COACHING.

2273
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
CINCINNATI WILL FACE PITTSBURGH

2274
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
NEXT WEEK IN WHAT COULD BE A

2275
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
PLAYOFF DECIDING GAME.

2276
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
THE JETS ARE STILL WORKING IN

2277
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
THE BACKGROUND.

2278
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
SHOCKING COMMENTS BY ESPN

2279
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
ANALYSTS ABOUT THE RACE OF AN

2280
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,000
NFL ROOKIE SUPERSTAR, RGIII.

2281
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
ROB PARKER QUESTIONED THE

2282
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
BLACKNESS OF THE QUARTERBACK

2283
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
YESTERDAY.

2284
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO RG 3

2285
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
TELLING THE MEDIA THAT HE

2286
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
REFUSED TO BE DEFINED BY RACE.

2287
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
HERE IS WHAT PARKER SAID.

2288
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
>> THIS THING WE ALL KNOW HE HAS

2289
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
A WHITE FIANCE, THERE WAS A TALK

2290
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
ABOUT HE'S A REPUBLICAN.

2291
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
HE'S NOT REALLY, OKAY, BLACK, HE

2292
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
KIND OF DOES THE THING, BUT HE'S

2293
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
NOT REALLY DOWN WITH THE CAUSE,

2294
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
HE'S NOT ONE OF US.

2295
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
HE'S KIND OF BLACK, BUT HE'S NOT

2296
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
REALLY LIKE THE GUY YOU REALLY

2297
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
WANT TO HANG OUT WITH 'CAUSE

2298
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
HE'S OFF TO SOMETHING.

2299
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
>> Gretchen: WHAT?

2300
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
>> Brian: ACTUALLY GOT WORSE
FROM THERE.

2301
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
GRIFFIN MAY NOT WANT TO BE

2302
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
DEFINED BY RACE, BUT RELIGION IS

2303
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
IMPORTANT TO HIM.
LAST MONTH HE TOLD REPORTERS THE

2304
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,000
ONLY THING HE FEARS IS GOD.

2305
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
ESPN SPOKESPERSON SAID THE

2306
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
COMMENTS WERE APPROPRIATE AND I

2307
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
THINK HE'S ON SUSPENSION.

2308
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I KNOW HIM, HE'S A GREAT GAPE OF

2309
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
THE I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THOSE

2310
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
COMMENTS.
STEVEN H. SMITH SAYS I REALLY

2311
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
WANT NO PART OF THIS

2312
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
CONVERSATION.
>> Gretchen: I THINK I'M GOING

2313
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,000
TO LEAVE THAT STORY OUT OF MY

2314
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
SON'S --

2315
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
>> Brian: IT WILL BE A LITTLE

2316
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
CONTROVERSIAL.
>> Gretchen: THE JOSH HAMTON

2317
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
DEAL MAYBE.

2318
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
>> Brian: FIVE YEARS,

2319
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
125 MILLION.

2320
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
>> Gretchen: THANKS.
2012 HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE YEAR

2321
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
AT THE BOX OFFICE.

2322
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
OUR NEXT GUEST SAYS THE BEST IS

2323
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
YET DO COME.

2324
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
SOME OF THE BIGGEST BLOCKBUSTERS

2325
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
ARE COMING OUT IN TIME FOR

2326
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,000
CHRISTMAS.
KEVIN IS THE FOUNDER OF NERD

2327
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
TEARS.COM.

2328
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK --

2329
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, GOOD MORNING.

2330
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON "THE

2331
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
HOBBIT" IS AN INCREDIBLE FILM

2332
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
DIRECTED BY PETER JACKSON.

2333
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
HERE IS THE DEAL, IT'S GOING TO

2334
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
BE A LITTLE OVERWHELMING FOR

2335
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
AUDIENCES BECAUSE THERE ARE SIX

2336
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN BUY

2337
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
TICKETS AND SEE "THE HOBBIT."

2338
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,000
2 D, 3 D, 3 D IMAX.

2339
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
HE SHOT THE FILM IN

2340
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
REVOLUTIONARY 48 FILMS PER SECT.

2341
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
TO KEEP THAT LESS GEEKY AS

2342
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
POSSIBLE, THAT MEANS YOU'RE

2343
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
GETTING TWICE AS MANY IMAGES ON

2344
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
SCREEN PER SECOND, SO IT LOOKS

2345
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING AT MORE REAL

2346
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
LIFE.

2347
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING
INTO A WINDOW OF A REAL LIFE

2348
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
SET.

2349
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
IT LOOKS INCREDIBLE.

2350
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
PETER JACKSON HAS DONE IT AGAIN.

2351
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
IT'S BEAUTIFUL MARSPIECE.

2352
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
3 D IS INCREDIBLE.

02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
IT BECAME CLEAR THAT EVERYBODY

3065
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,000
WAS PILING ON.
IN THE CASE OF AMBASSADOR RICE

3066
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
WHEN THEY STARTED DIGGING UP

3067
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN AFRICA IN 1998

3068
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:43,000
IN THE TANZANIA AND KENYA EMBASE

3069
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,000
BOMBINGS WHEN SHE WAS A

3070
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL PERSON, SHE

3071
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
GOT PILED ON FOR THAT.

3072
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
WHEN THEY STARTED ANDING THE

3073
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:52,000
FINANCES OF AMBASSADOR RICE AND

3074
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
HER HUSBAND WHO ARE QUITE

3075
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
WEALTHY AND STARTED POURING INTO

3076
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,000
EVERY DETAIL AND SHE WAS NOT

3077
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:57,000
BEING DEFENDED BY THE

3078
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,000
ADMINISTRATION.

3079
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
I MEAN, THE PRESIDENT WAS MAKING

3080
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
ALL THE RIGHT SOUNDS, IF YOU

3081
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
WANT TO PICK ON ANYONE, PICK ON

3082
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
ME, THUMPING HIS CHEST AND ALT

3083
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
REST.
BUT THE FACT IS, SHE HAD NO

3084
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:10,000
GROUP APPOINTED BY THE OBAMA

3085
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
ADMINISTRATION TO DEFEND HER

3086
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:14,000
AGAINST THESE ATTACKS.

3087
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,000
BUT THE TWO NORTHEASTERN NOD

3088
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:18,000
RATE REPUBLICANS, SUSAN COLLINS

3089
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
AND KELLY AYOTTE, JOINED THE

3090
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
ANGRY WHITE MEN, YOU KNOW,

3091
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:26,000
GRAHAM AND McCAIN, AND THEN IT

3092
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:29,000
COULDN'T BE A MALE-FEMALE ISSUE

3093
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
AGAINST THIS POOR BELEAGUERED

3094
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
BLACK WOMAN --

3095
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
>> Brian: YOU DON'T BELIEVE

3096
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
THAT.
>> Gretchen: ANGRY OLD WHITE

3097
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,000
MEN?
>> I AM SPEAKING EXPANSESIVELY

3098
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
AND METAPHORLY AND FOR EFFECT

3099
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
HERE.
BUT IT BECAME CLEAR SHE COULDN'T

3100
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:47,000
BE THE BELEAGUERED DAMSEL IN

3101
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
DISTRESS.

3102
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,000
THE POOR BLACK EMBATTLED

3103
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,000
AMBASSADOR.
IT BECAME CLEAR THAT SHE WAS THE

3104
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,000
MINIMUM PRICE.

3105
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,000
I HAVE TO SAY ONE MORE SENTENCE.

3106
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
SHE WAS THE MINIMUM PRICE TO PAY

3107
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
FOR THE ADMINISTRATION'S

3108
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
DISASSEMBLING ON THE FACTS AND

3109
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,000
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BENGHAZI

3110
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,000
ATTACK.

3111
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
SHE WAS GOING TO BE THE MINIMUM

3112
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
PRICE THAT THE DEMOCRATS THAT

3113
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAD TO

3114
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:11,000
PAY FOR THAT CLEAR OFFENSE JUST

3115
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
AS I BELIEVE THE TAX HIKE ON THE

3116
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
2% IS THE MINIMUM PRICE THE

3117
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,000
REPUBLICANS HAVE TO PAY FOR

3118
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,000
LOSING THE ELECTION.

3119
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
IN WASHINGTON YOU MAKE MINIMUM

3120
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
PRICES.
SHE'S THE SACRIFICIAL LAMB.

3121
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,000
>> Gretchen: I TOTALLY AGREE

3122
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:28,000
WITH YOU, IT WAS THE SENATOR

3123
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
FROM MAINE, THAT THAT WAS --

3124
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
COLLINS, THAT WAS IT, BECAUSE

3125
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,000
SHE IS THE MODERATE.

3126
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,000
IF YOU COULDN'T GET THE

3127
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,000
MODERATES ON BOARD.

3128
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,000
BUT HERE IS MY QUESTION FOR YOU,

3129
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
DOES THIS MEAN THAT BENGHAZI

3130
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
GOES AWAY NOW?

3131
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,000
BECAUSE NOW THERE IS ALL THIS

3132
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000
TALK THAT HILLARY CLINTON, SHE

3133
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,000
WAS GOING TO TESTIFY

3134
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
DECEMBER 20, NOW SHE MAY NOT

3135
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,000
BECAUSE THERE MAY BE THIS

3136
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,000
BOMBSHELL REPORT THAT'S COMING

3137
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
OUT AND MAYBE HILLARY CLINTON
WANTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

3138
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:55,000
>> THAT'S A LOT THERE.

3139
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:56,000
REMEMBER MUNICH, 1972, THE

3140
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,000
ISRAELI ATHLETES ARE MASSACRED

3141
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:02,000
BY THE PALESTINIAN RADICALS IN

3142
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
THE OLYMPIC GAMES.
ALL RIGHT.

3143
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
THEN YOU HAVE FOR THE NEXT

3144
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
DECADE THE ISRAELIS HUNTING DOWN

3145
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
THE PERPETRATORS AND KILLING THE

3146
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
PEOPLE WHO PERPETRATED THE MASS

3147
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
MURDER OF THE ISRAELI ATHLETES.

3148
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
THAT'S THE ARMED FORCES

3149
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
APPROACH, OR THE SENDING SEAL

3150
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
TEAM 6 AGAINST OSAMA BIN LADEN.

3151
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
THAT'S THE MILITARY APPROACH.

3152
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN BENGHAZI IS

3153
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
PRETTY CLEAR TO ME.

3154
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,000
IT'S A LAW ENFORCEMENT APPROACH.

3155
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:25,000
WE BUSTED THEM AT THE AIRPORT IN

3156
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,000
TURKEY.
IN CAIRO THE COPS THERE

3157
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
APPREHENDED ONE OF THE ALLEGED

3158
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,000
MASTERMINDS OF THE BENGHAZI

3159
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
ATTACKS.
IT'S CLEAR THERE WILL BE A LAW

3160
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,000
ENFORCEMENT APPROACH TO CATCHING

3161
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
THE PERPETRATORS OF THE BENGHAZI

3162
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
ATTACKS.
NOT A MILITARY APPROACH.

3163
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:42,000
NOW, I BELIEVE IN TERMS OF THE

3164
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
HILLARY CLINTON TESTIMONY, THEY

3165
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:48,000
CAN NOW USE THAT SECRETIVE,

3166
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,000
UNDERCOVER, LAW ENFORCEMENT

3167
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
APPROACH AS THE REASON THEY DO

3168
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,000
NOT PUBLICLY DISCLOSE WHAT

3169
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,000
THEY'RE DOING TO APPREHEND THE

3170
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
PERPETRATORS -- BUT ALSO MAY BE

3171
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,000
TRUE.

3172
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
>> Brian: THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

3173
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:04,000
APPROACH HAS FALLEN VERY SHORT.

3174
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
>> WE HAVE A HALF DOZEN IN

3175
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,000
CUSTODY.

3176
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,000
>> WE HAD A SENATOR WHO HAD TO

3177
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
GET THE F.B.I. IN TO QUESTION

3178
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
THOSE CAPTURED WOULD BE KILL

3179
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,000
INCREASE TUNISIA.

3180
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
THERE HAS BEEN NO PURSUIT BY OUR

3181
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,000
GOVERNMENT TO QUESTION THESE

3182
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,000
GUYS.
>> THE ONE THING WE CAN'T DO,

3183
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
IT'S CLEAR TO EVERYBODY, IS HAVE

3184
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:23,000
A DRONE GO OVER THE MILITIA

3185
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:24,000
HEADQUARTERS IN BENGHAZI AND

3186
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:28,000
BOMB THEM BECAUSE IT'S TOO SMALL

3187
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:29,000
THERE.

3188
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW, THIS

3189
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,000
GUY FROM -- THE PERPETRATOR FROM

3190
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
HIS COUSIN.
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION.

3191
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,000
I THINK THAT PRECISE SURGICAL

3192
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
STUFF IS MAYBE THE WAY TO DO IT.

3193
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:40,000
>> Gretchen: WE HAVE TO GET ON

3194
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
TO ANOTHER STATE DEPARTMENT

3195
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
ISSUE, THE FORMER MARINE SERVED

3196
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,000
IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, HE'S

3197
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,000
GOING TO COSTA RICA.

3198
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
HE STOPS IN MEXICO, REGISTERS

3199
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,000
HIS GUN BEFORE HE GOES ACROSS

3200
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,000
THE BORDER.

3201
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,000
NOW HE'S BEEN IN JAIL SINCE

3202
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,000
AUGUST.

3203
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,000
HE'S CHAINED TO A BED.

3204
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
SHOULD THE STATE DEPARTMENT BE

3205
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:58,000
WORKING HARDER TO GET HIM HOME?

3206
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, UNIQUELY I

3207
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,000
COVERED MEXICAN PRISONS.

3208
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
I'VE BEEN INSIDE THE MOST

3209
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
NOTORIOUS.
I'VE NEVER SEEN AN INMATE CHAIN

3210
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
TO DO A BED.

3211
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE

3212
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
CONGRESSWOMAN IS NOT BEING, YOU

3213
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
KNOW, ACCURATE HERE.

3214
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
I'M JUST SAYING IN MY

3215
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
EXPERIENCE, HAVE NEVER SEEN IT.

3216
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,000
REMEMBER ALSO THAT THE MEXICANS

3217
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
ARE EXTREMELY TICKED OFF ABOUT

3218
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,000
FAST AND FURIOUS AND ALL THE

3219
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
GUNS WE POURED INTO THAT

3220
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,000
COUNTRY.

3221
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:21,000
THEY'RE --
>> Steve: BUT TO CHAIN HIM TO A

3222
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,000
BED?

3223
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,000
>> WE DON'T KNOW THAT'S THAT

3224
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
TRUE.
SECONDLY, REMEMBER THEY ARE

3225
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
VERY, VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT THEIR

3226
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
OWN SOVEREIGNTY AND THE FACT

3227
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:29,000
THAT AMERICAN GUNS HAVE BEEN

3228
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,000
POURING INTO THE COUNTRY.

3229
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:35,000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THAT DOESN'T IN ANY WAY SAY THIS

3230
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:36,000
MAN SHOULD BE BEHIND BARS

3231
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS AN

3232
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
ATROCITY.

3233
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:40,000
I DON'T KNOW WHY OUR CUSTOMS AND

3234
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:41,000
BORDER PROTECTION PEOPLE DIDN'T

3235
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,000
WARN HIM.

3236
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
HE'S BRINGING A SHOTGUN INTO

3237
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
MEXICO, SAY, HEY, DUDE, THEY'RE

3238
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:48,000
GOING TO BUST YOU 100 FEET FROM

3239
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,000
HERE!

3240
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
>> Gretchen: WE WERE THE FIRST
ONES TO BREAK THIS STORY.

02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,000
THANKS.

3419
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:22,000
>> THANKS.
>> Brian: 19 MINUTES AFTER THE

3420
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
HOUR.
>> Gretchen: NO LOVE FOR JESUS?

3421
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
A JESUS LOOK ALIKE TOSSED RIGHT

3422
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
OUT OF A SPORTS STADIUM AND WAIT

3423
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:31,000
UNTIL YOU HEAR WHY.

3424
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
>> Brian: DO YOUR CHRISTMAS

3425
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:35,000
PHOTOS ALWAYS TURN OUT LIKE

3426
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,000
THIS?
THERE ARE SIMPLE THINGS YOU CAN

3427
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
DO TO MAKE SURE YOUR PHOTOS ARE

3428
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
PICTURE PERFECT.
WE'LL SHARE THE SECRETS, IF YOU

3429
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:44,000
PROMISE TO KEEP IT A SECRET.

3430
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:49,000
YEARS AGO, MY DOCTOR TOLD ME

3431
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
TO TAKE A CENTRUM SILVER
MULTIVITAMIN EVERY DAY.

3432
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:32,000
I TOLD HIM, SURE.
CAN'T HURT, RIGHT?

3433
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:35,000
THEN I HEARD THIS NEWS
ABOUT A MULTIVITAMIN STUDY

3434
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:39,000
LOOKING AT LONG-TERM
HEALTH BENEFITS FOR MEN OVER 50.

3435
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:40,000
THE ONE THEY USED
IN THAT STUDY...

3436
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
CENTRUM SILVER.

3437
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
THAT'S WHAT I TAKE.

3438
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,000
MY DOCTOR!

3439
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
HE KNOWS HIS STUFF.

3440
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
[ Male Announcer ] CENTRUM.

3441
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
THE MOST RECOMMENDED.

3442
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,000
MOST PREFERRED.

3443
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,000
MOST STUDIED.

3444
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:57,000
CENTRUM,
ALWAYS YOUR MOST COMPLETE.

3445
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:07,000
>> Gretchen: 23 MINUTES AFTER
THE TOP OF THE HOUR.

3446
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:08,000
QUICK HEADLINES.

3447
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
COULD JENNY RIVERA HAVE AVOIDED

3448
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:11,000
DEATH?

3449
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:12,000
IT TURNS OUT THE MEXICAN

3450
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
AMERICAN SINGER MADE A LAST

3451
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
MINUTE DECISION TO TAKE THAT

3452
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,000
DEADLY PLANE RIDE.

3453
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:18,000
SHE WAS OFFERED A ROOM FOR THE

3454
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,000
NIGHT, BUT SHE DECIDED TO TAKE

3455
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:22,000
OFF TO HER NEXT DESTINATI

3456
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,000
>>> AND THE SHOW WON'T BE GOING

3457
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:26,000
ON AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN

3458
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,000
MASSACHUSETTS.
THE TRADITIONAL HOLIDAY CONCERT

3459
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
AT JORDAN JACKSON ELEMENTARY IN

3460
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:30,000
MANSFIELD, GUESS WHAT?

3461
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
IT'S BEEN CANCELED.

3462
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,000
PARENTS COMPLAINED THAT LAST

3463
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
YEAR'S PERFORMANCE WAS TOO

3464
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:36,000
RELIGIOUS.

3465
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
A SPEECH ON ANTI-BULLYING WILL

3466
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:41,000
TAKE THE PLACE OF THE CONCERT IN

3467
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
JANUARY.
CHRISTMAS?

3468
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:44,000
BULLYING?

3469
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:45,000
HH, I DON'T SEE A LOT OF

3470
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:46,000
SIMILARITIES.

3471
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,000
BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL BE

3472
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,000
DOING.
STEVE?

3473
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:49,000
>> Steve: IT IS.

3474
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,000
THANKS.
DON'T SPEND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS

3475
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
ON PROFESSIONAL HOLIDAY PICTURES

3476
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
THIS YEAR.
WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW YOU

3477
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THOSE SAME

3478
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
PERFECT PICTURES WITH YOUR OWN

3479
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:59,000
CAMERA.

3480
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:00,000
THE PRESIDENT OF UNIQUE PHOTO IN

3481
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:03,000
NEW JERSEY JOINS US NOW.

3482
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:04,000
>> GREAT TO BE HERE.

3483
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:05,000
>> Steve: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A

3484
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
LOT OF PICTURES OVER THE NEXT

3485
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:08,000
COUPLE OF WEEKS AND THE AVERAGE

3486
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:11,000
PERSON, WHETHER THEY GOT THE

3487
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
FANCY SINGLE LENS REFLEX CAMERA

3488
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,000
OR POINT AND SHOOT, THEY PUT IT

3489
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
ON AUTOMATIC AND THEY JUST TAKE

3490
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:17,000
ALL THEIR PICTURES.

3491
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
THAT WINDS UP WITH A PICTURE

3492
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:22,000
LIKE THIS WHERE IT'S IT'S A

3493
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,000
FAMILY ACTION SHOT, BUT THE GIRL

3494
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:24,000
IS A LITTLE DARK.

3495
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:25,000
YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE WHAT'S

3496
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
GOING ON OF THE HOW DO WE FIX

3497
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:28,000
THAT?

3498
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:29,000
>> TAKING PICTURES, IS WHAT WE

3499
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
DO AT UNIQUE PHOTO.

3500
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
WE REALLY TRY TO GET TO YOU WORK

3501
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
ON TURNING THE CAMERA OFF THE

3502
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
AUTOMATIC MODE.
GET INTO THE MANUAL MODES ON THE

3503
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:38,000
CAMERA.
IN A TICKET LIKE THAT, THE

3504
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
CAMERA SENSES THE LIGHT IN THE

3505
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,000
AREA AND DOESN'T REALIZE THAT

3506
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
YOU REALLY WANT A PICTURE OF THE

3507
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:44,000
LOVELY YOUNG GIRL THAT'S THERE.

3508
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:45,000
SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU PUT THE

3509
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
CAMERA IN A PROGRAM MODE, ROTATE

3510
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:48,000
THE DIAL.

3511
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:49,000
YOU FORCE THE FLASH TO FIRE IN

3512
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
THE CAMERA.

3513
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:52,000
CALLED FILL FLASH.

3514
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:53,000
>> Steve: THE THING WITH -- NEXT

3515
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
THING YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT

3516
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:56,000
THAT, YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE

3517
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:57,000
DETAIL ON THE GIRL.

3518
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:58,000
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL PICTURE.

3519
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:59,000
LET'S COME DOWN TO THE NEXT ONE.

3520
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE

3521
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
PLAYING IN THE SNOW, BUT I HAVE

3522
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:04,000
GOTTEN THIS PICTURE MANY, MANY

3523
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
TIMES, SHOOTING THE KIDS,

3524
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
PLAYING IN THE SNOW ON

3525
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
AUTOMATIC.
IT SEEMS EVERYBODY IS A LITTLE

3526
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,000
BLURRY.
>> YEAH.
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS

3527
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,000
WHERE YOU WANT TO PUT THE CAMERA

3528
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
IN ITS SHUTTER PRIORITY MODE

3529
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,000
BECAUSE THE CAMERA WILL SENSE

3530
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
THE BRIGHT SNOW AND BRIGHT LIGHT

3531
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:18,000
AND WON'T PICK A SHUTTER SPEED

3532
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:19,000
WHICH IS FAST ENOUGH.

3533
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
THEN WHEN THE CHILDREN JUMP AND

3534
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:22,000
THE SNOW GO UP IN THE AIR, THEY

3535
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:23,000
BLUR.

3536
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
SO YOU HAVE TO FORCE THE SHUT TO

3537
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:28,000
GO SPEED FASTER.

3538
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
YOU'LL SHOOT AT 1,000th OF A

3539
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:31,000
SECRETARY.
>> Steve: IF I DON'T KNOW HOW IT

3540
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
DO THE PRIORITY MODE, CAN I GO

3541
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
INTO, IN MIAMI CAMERA HAS ICONS,

3542
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
I CAN SWITCH AROUND?

3543
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
A LOT OF THE CAMERAS TODAY HAVE

3544
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:40,000
PORT TRAIT MODE, SPORTS MODE,

3545
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
ALL SORTS OF THINGS LIKE THAT.

3546
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:43,000
THEY ADJUST THE CAMERAS REALLY,

3547
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:46,000
REALLY WELL.
THEY COO A PRETTY GOOD JOB.

3548
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
>> Steve: NOW, THIS WOULD BE IN

3549
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:49,000
PORTRAIT MODE.

3550
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
IT IS, WELL, NICELY LIGHTED.

3551
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:55,000
BUT IT'S KIND OF AWKWARD, ISN'T

3552
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:56,000
IT?
>> THIS IS A SOPHISTICATED

3553
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:57,000
PICTURE TAKING CIRCUMSTANCE.

3554
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO --

3555
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,000
>> THAT'S HOLDING A GLASS.

3556
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,000
MAYBE NOT THE APPROPRIATE DRESS.

3557
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
THE KID IS WEARING KIND OF A

3558
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:04,000
NUTTY HAT.

3559
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WANT --

3560
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
AS A PHOTOGRAPHER, IS YOU WANT

3561
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:08,000
TO CONTROL YOUR SUBJECTS A

3562
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:09,000
LITTLE BIT.

3563
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,000
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

3564
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,000
DON'T DO THINGS THAT THEY WANT

3565
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:12,000
TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED IN 'CAUSE

3566
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS LAST FOREVER.

3567
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
I'M NOT SURE THAT THE PERSON IN

3568
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:17,000
THAT PHOTOGRAPH WANTS TO HAVE A

3569
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:18,000
GLASS IN HER HAND OR WANTS TO

3570
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:19,000
LOOK LIKE THAT.

3571
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
THE FRAMING OF THE PICTURE,

3572
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
REALLY AFFECTS IT.

3573
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:24,000
>> Steve: THIS IS THE KIND OF

3574
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:25,000
PICTURE YOU WOULD LIKE A

3575
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:28,000
PORTRAIT TO WIND UP AT.

3576
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,000
THERE SEEMS TO BE A DIFFERENT

3577
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:30,000
DYNAMIC.

3578
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:31,000
WHAT DID THE PHOTOGRAPHER TELL

3579
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:32,000
THESE PEOPLE THAT THEY DIDN'T

3580
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,000
TELL THE OTHERS?

3581
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,000
>> HE TRIED TO GET THE

3582
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,000
EXPRESSIONS UNIFORM.

3583
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:36,000
THEY'RE ALL SMILING, THEY'RE ALL

3584
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,000
DRESSED THE SAME.

3585
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,000
HE'S FRAMED IT RIGHT.

3586
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,000
WE'RE NOT CUTTING ANYBODY'S

3587
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:40,000
HEADS OFF.

3588
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,000
SO YOU CAN SEE THE PICTURE

3589
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,000
PROVIDES A MUCH MORE HAPPY

3590
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:43,000
MEMORY OF WHAT'S BEGUN ON.

3591
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
THEY DON'T LOOK SO HAPPY IN THAT

3592
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
PICTURE.
>> Steve: NO KIDDING.

3593
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:50,000
MEANWHILE, IF YOU ARE LIKE CLARK

3594
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,000
GRISWOLD, SPEND 25 DAYS GETTING

3595
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:52,000
READY FOR CHRISTMAS, YOU HAVE

3596
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000

02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:53,000
HARRY, PICTURED THERE, STOPPED

3772
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:57,000
BY -- WHO IS HE WITH THERE?

3773
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:00,000
STOPPED BY THE AL SHARPTON SHOW

3774
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:04,000
OVER ON MSDNC A COUPLE OF DAYS

3775
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:05,000
AGO AND HE WAS TALKING A LITTLE

3776
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:06,000
BIT ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT

3777
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
SHOULD DO WITH ALL THOSE PEOPLE

3778
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:11,000
WHO ON THE RIGHT, OPPOSE SOME OF

3779
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:12,000
HIS POLICIES.

3780
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:17,000
HERE IS WHAT MR. DEO SAID.

3781
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:22,000
>> FASCINATES ME IS THAT
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS EXPRESSING

3782
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:27,000
THEIR DESIRE TO STIFF -- THAT

3783
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:31,000
THERE SHOULD BE THIS LINGERING

3784
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
INFESTATION OF REALLY CORRUPT

3785
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
PEOPLE WHO SIT TRYING TO

3786
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:36,000
DISMANTLE THE WISHES OF THE

3787
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:39,000
PEOPLE, THE MANDATE THAT HAS

3788
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
BEEN GIVEN TO BARAK OBAMA, AND I

3789
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE THEY WANT.

3790
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:47,000
THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR OBAMA TO

3791
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:50,000
DO IS TO BE LIKE A THIRD WORLD

3792
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:55,000
DICTATOR AND THROW THESE GUYS IN

3793
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:56,000
JAIL.
>> Steve: THROW THEM IN JAIL.

3794
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:57,000
>> Brian: IF THE PRESIDENT GETS

3795
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:58,000
RELIE DETECTORRED, HE SHOULD BE

3796
02:35:58,000 --> 02:35:59,000
ABLE TO DO WHATEVER HE WANTS.

3797
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:00,000
DID HE FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT

3798
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:03,000
GEORGE BUSH WHEN HE WON BAY

3799
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:04,000
WIDER MARGIN?

3800
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:05,000
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE DEMOCRATS

3801
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:06,000
THAT GOT IN HIS WAY?

3802
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
SHOULD THEY HAVE BEEN JAILED?

3803
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:09,000
>> Steve: SPEAK OF DICTATORS,
HE'S KNOWN A FEW.

3804
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:12,000
REMEMBER IN 2006 HE ACTUALLY

3805
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:15,000
WENT DOWN TO VISIT CHAVEZ IN

3806
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
VENEZUELA AND REFERRED TO GEORGE

3807
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
W. BUSH AS THE BIGGEST TRYST IN

3808
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:20,000
THE WORLD.

3809
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:21,000
>> Brian: THAT WAS FANTASTIC.
>> Gretchen: HERE IS A DIFFERENT

3810
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:24,000
QUOTE WHERE HE CALLED HOMELAND

3811
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:29,000
SECURITY THE GESTAPO.

3812
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
CITIZENS ARE HAVING THEIR RIGHTS

3813
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,000
SUSPENDED.
YOU CAN BE ARRESTED AND NOT

3814
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:34,000
CHARGED, YOU CAN BE ARRESTED AND

3815
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:37,000
HAVE NO RIGHT TO COUNSEL.

3816
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:38,000
>> Brian: YOU MEAN THOSE CHARGES

3817
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
THAT -- THOSE ACTS, LIKE THE

3818
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
PATRIOT ACT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA

3819
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:43,000
LEFT IN PLACE?

3820
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
THAT'S THE PERIOD OF AMERICA?

3821
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:46,000
HERE HE IS SAYING SOMETHING

3822
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:47,000
ELSE.

3823
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:50,000
PRAISING A COP KILLER.

3824
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:54,000
LISTEN.
>> SUCH IS THE CASE WITH JAMAL,

3825
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
HE IS NOT GUILTY OF THE CRIME

3826
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
FOR WHICH HE HAS BEEN CHARGED.

3827
02:36:58,000 --> 02:36:59,000
HE DID NOT COMMIT THE CRIMES.

3828
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
HE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH.

3829
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:05,000
THOSE WHO PROSECUTED HIM KNOW

3830
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
THAT.
IF IT'S UP TO US, CITIZENS THE

3831
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
WORLD WHO CARE ABOUT JUSTICE TO

3832
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
STAY THE COURSE, TO MAKE SURE

3833
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:14,000
THAT HE IS RELEASED.

3834
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:15,000
>> Steve: FREEDOM OF SPEECH,

3835
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:18,000
HARRY BELAFONTE.

3836
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:19,000
>> Gretchen: NOW TO YOUR
HEADLINE THIS MORNING.

3837
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:22,000
ONE OF THE ONLY LIVING MEDAL OF

3838
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:23,000
HONOR RECIPIENTS RECOVERING FROM

3839
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:24,000
A BRUTAL ATTACK.

3840
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:27,000
DETAILS ON THE ATTACK ON DAKOTA

3841
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:28,000
MYER.
WE KNOW AN 18-YEAR-OLD HAS BEEN

3842
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
CHARGED WITH ASSAULT.

3843
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:33,000
HE WAS AWARD THE MILITARY

3844
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:34,000
HIGHEST HORN BY PRESIDENT OBAMA
LAST YEAR.

3845
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
HE'S CREDITED WITH SAVING THE

3846
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
LIVES OF 13 AMERICANS AND 23

3847
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:41,000
AFGHAN SOLDIERS DURING A FIRE

3848
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:42,000
FIGHT IN 2009.

3849
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
>> Steve: SHE'S ACCUSED OF DRUNK

3850
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:47,000
DRIVING IN MAINE.
BUT SALLY STRUTHERS SAYS SHE

3851
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
DIDN'T DO IT.

3852
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:50,000
OH, GLORIA.

3853
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:51,000
HER LAWYER HAS ENTERED A NOT

3854
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:52,000
GUILTY PLEA FOR HER.

3855
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:55,000
SHE WAS ARRESTED IN SEPTEMBER IN

3856
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
MAINE WHERE SHE FREQUENTLY PLAYS

3857
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
A ROLE IN THE MUSICAL "NINE TO

3858
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:00,000
FIVE."

3859
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
SHE'S SCHEDULED TO BE BACK IN

3860
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:03,000
COURT IN FEBRUARY.

3861
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
>> Brian: I DIDN'T KNOW "NINE TO

3862
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:10,000
FIVE" WAS PLAYING IN MAINE.

3863
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:12,000
A NEW STUDY FINDS CHILDREN BORN

3864
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:13,000
WITH A C SECTION ARE MORE LIKELY

3865
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:16,000
TO EAT FATTY FOODS AND BECOME

3866
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:17,000
OVERWEIGHT LATER IN LIFE.

3867
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
RESEARCHERS LOOKED AT NINE

3868
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:20,000
STUDIES OF OVER 200,000 PEOPLE

3869
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:21,000
AND FOUND WHEN BORN BY C

3870
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
SECTION, THE BABIES WERE 33%

3871
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
MORE LIKELY TO BECOME HEAVY.

3872
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:28,000
BUT THEY SAY THIS DOESN'T MEAN

3873
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
THAT A CAESAREAN CAUSED THE

3874
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
BABIES TO GAIN WEIGHT.

3875
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
IT'S EASY ON THE BABY THROUGH A

3876
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
C SECTION.

3877
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:37,000
>> Gretchen: REALLY?
>> Brian: YEAH.

3878
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:38,000
EASIER ON THE BABY.

3879
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:39,000
>> Gretchen: ON THE MOM,

3880
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:40,000
DIFFERENT STORY.

3881
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:43,000
BUT LET'S NOT GET INTO THAT

3882
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:44,000
RIGHT NOW.

3883
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:45,000
A JESUS LOOK ALIKE TOSSED OUT OF

3884
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:50,000
A SPORTING EVENT IN ENGLAND.

3885
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
ALL RIGHT.
SO YOU SEE THAT IMAGE THERE.

3886
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
THAT'S NATHAN GRINNEDLE BEING

3887
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:01,000
ESCORTED BY POLICE.

3888
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AT THE

3889
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
PROFESSIONAL DARTS TOURNAMENT

3890
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
BEGAN CHANTING JESUS, JESUS!

3891
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
WHEN THEY SAW HIM.

3892
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:10,000
ORGANIZERS SAID IT WAS TOO

3893
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
DISTRACTING TO THE PLAYERS, SO

3894
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:15,000
THEY ASKED HIM TO LEAVE?

3895
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:16,000
MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE STUCK

3896
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:17,000
AROUND FOR A LITTLE INSPIRATION

3897
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:20,000
FOR THE DART THROWING.

3898
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:21,000
EXACTLY!

3899
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:24,000
THEY COULD HAVE PLAYED THIS
MUSIC AND MAYBE THEY WOULD HAVE

3900
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
DONE BETTER.
>> Brian: WHEN JESUS DOES COME

3901
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
BACK, SHOULD WE GREET HIM WITH A

3902
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,000
CHANT?
>> Gretchen: YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

3903
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
KNOW.
YOU NEED TO GO TO CONFESSION A

3904
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:32,000
FEW MORE TIMES BEFORE THAT'S

3905
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
GOING TO HAPPEN.

3906
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:38,000
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Steve: WITH A POLICE ESCORT.

3907
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:39,000
>> Brian: IT'S DANGEROUS.

3908
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
COULD CAUSE A RIOT.

3909
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
>> Steve: THOSE DARTS GUYS,
THEY'VE GOT TO CONCENTRATE,

3910
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:44,000
PLEASE.
>> Brian: PLEASE, JESUS.

3911
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:45,000
ENOUGH.

3912
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:46,000
>> Steve: ALL RIGHT.

THREATENING TO GO ON STRIKE.

3917
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
LATE BREAKING DETAILS THAT COULD

3918
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
SLOW YOU DOWN AS YOU THEY HAD

3919
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:58,000
GRANDMA'S HOUSE.

3920
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,000

3921
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
AS A PRIVATE CONVERSATION ON

SOME BUSES BECAUSE BIG BROTHER

3923

3924
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
IS THAT EVEN LEGAL?

3925
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000

SECONDS AND YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT

3941
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:32,000
NOW AT HOME OR AT WORK AND THE

3942
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,000
OUTCOME WILL DETERMINE HOW LONG

02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000

IS THAT A GOOD IDEA?

3948
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:43,000
THAT'S ALL THIS WEEKEND STARTING

3949
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:44,000
AT 6:00 A.M. EASTERN.

3950
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
SEE YOU THEN

3951
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:51,000
.so as you can see,s
customer satisfaction is at 97%.

3952
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:05,000
Mmmm tasty.

3953
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
And cut! Very good.

3954
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:10,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

3955
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

3956
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:15,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

3957
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:16,000
It's not real.

3958
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:20,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

3959
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:23,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

3960
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:27,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

3961
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

3962
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:37,000
TRY RUNNING FOUR.NING
A RESTAURANT IS HARD,

3963
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:42,000
FORTUNATELY WE'VE GOT INK.

PLUS AT OFFICE SUPPLY STORES.

3967
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
REWARDS WE PUT RIGHT
BACK INTO OUR BUSINESS.

3968
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
THIS IS THE ONLY THING
WE'VE EVER WANTED TO DO

3969
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
AND INK HELPS US DO IT.

3970
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:02,000
MAKE YOUR MARK
WITH INK FROM CHASE.

3971
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:06,000
>> Brian: HUNDREDS OF PRIVATE

3972
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:07,000
SECURITY WORKERS IN NEW YORK JFK

3973
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:08,000
AIRPORT THREATENING TO WALK OFF

3974
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:11,000
THE JOB JUST DAYS BEFORE

3975
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:14,000
CHRISTMAS IF THEIR DEMANDS

3976
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
AREN'T MET.

3977
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
NOW MORE WITH WHAT THIS COULD

3978
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:22,000
MEAN FOR HOLIDAY TRAVELERS.

3979
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:23,000
LYDIA?
>> GOOD MORNING, BRIAN.

3980
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
EXACTLY RIGHT.

3981
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
THIS STRIKE COULD HAPPEN FIVE

3982
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:28,000
DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

3983
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
300 WORKERS COULD GO ON STRIKE.

3984
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
THESE PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS,

3985
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:33,000
THEY ARE NONUNIONIZED WORKERS.

3986
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
RIGHT NOW WE STILL DON'T KNOW

3987
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:36,000
EXACTLY WHAT THIS COULD ALL MEAN

3988
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
FOR TRAVELERS.

3989
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:39,000
THEY HAVE VERY IMPORTANT JOBS

3990
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:42,000
HERE AT JFK AIRPORT.

3991
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:43,000
THEY ACTUALLY CONTROL THE

3992
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
TRAFFIC HERE IN FRONT OF THE

3993
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:46,000
TERMINALS.

3994
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,000
THEY ALSO GUARD ALARM DOORS.

3995
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
SO IF THIS COULD HAPPEN, IF THIS

3996
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
DOES HAPPEN, A LOT OF TRAVELERS

3997
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
WE SPOKE TO ARE EXTREMELY

3998
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
WORRIED ABOUT IT.

3999
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:56,000
AGAIN, THEY ARE NONUNION

4000
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:57,000
WORKERS, BUT THEY ARE BEING

4001
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
BACKED BY ONE OF THE LARGEST

4002
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:00,000
UNIONS IN THE COUNTRY.

4003
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
FOR NOW, THAT'S THE LATEST HERE

4004
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:03,000
AT JFK.

4005
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
BRIAN, BACK TO YOU.

4006
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
>> Brian: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

4007
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:08,000
GRETCH?
>> Gretchen: NEXT TIME YOU RIDE

4008
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
THE BUS, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY

4009
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:11,000
BECAUSE BIG BROTHER MAY BE

4010
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
LISTENING TO YOU ON THE BUS?

4011
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:14,000
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE

4012
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
INSTALLING AUDIO SURVEILLANCE ON

4013
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:17,000
PUBLIC BUSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

4014
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
GIVING THEM THE ABILITY TO

4015
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
RECORD ANY AND ALL

4016
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
CONVERSATIONS.
SO SHOULD PUBLIC SAFETY TRUMP

4017
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:27,000
YOUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY?

4018
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:28,000
GINNING -- JOINING ME, PETER

4019
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
JOHNSON, JR.
WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?

4020
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:31,000
>> I GUESS THERE HAVE BEEN

4021
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:32,000
CRIMES ON THESE BUSS AND THERE

4022
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:33,000
HAVE BEEN ISSUES WITH THE BUS

4023
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:34,000
DRIVERS AND SOME OF THE UNIONS

4024
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
ARE SAYING, LISTEN, YOU GOT TO

4025
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:37,000
PROTECT OUR BUS DRIVERS.

4026
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:38,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING, THOUGH, IS

4027
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
THAT YOUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY,

4028
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
LIMITED AS IT IS IN PUBLIC

4029
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
SITUATIONS, IS GOING TO GO OUT

4030
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
THE WINDOW IN PLACES LIKE SAN

4031
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
FRANCISCO ON THE TROLLEY CARS,

4032
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
DURHAM, EUGENE, OREGON,

4033
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
COLUMBUS, HARTFORD, ATHENS,

4034
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:53,000
OTHER CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY.

4035
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
THE D.H.S., DEPARTMENT OF

4036
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
HOMELAND SECURITY, AND CITY AND

4037
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
LOCAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES ARE

4038
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:02,000
PUTTING MONEY TOGETHER TO TAPE

4039
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:05,000
YOUR CONVERSATIONS ON BUSES.

4040
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:06,000
>> Gretchen: WHY CAN'T THEY PUT

4041
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:09,000
UP A CAMERA TO HELP US IF

4042
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:10,000
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE BUS

4043
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:11,000
DRIVER?

4044
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.
THEY HAVE CAMERAS.

4045
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:14,000
NOW THEY'RE INTEGRATING AUDIO.

4046
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:15,000
NOW THEY'RE INTEGRATING THAT IT

4047
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:19,000
CAN GO OUT ON THE WEB TO A DEPOT

4048
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
SOMEWHERE ELSE, TO A POLICE

4049
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:22,000
FACILITY, TO SOMEONE THAT CAN

4050
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
LISTEN TO YOUR CONVERSATION WITH

4051
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
YOUR CHILDREN ON THE BUS.

4052
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:27,000
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SCHOOL,

4053
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:28,000
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GOING TO

4054
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:31,000
SEE A RELATIVE, GOING TO SEE

4055
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
YOUR MOTHER, AND ALL OF THAT

4056
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:38,000
STUFF BECOMES PART OF THE ETHER.

4057
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:39,000
>> Gretchen: I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T

4058
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
SAY I WAS TALKING TO MY HUSBAND

4059
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:42,000
ABOUT DATE NIGHT.

4060
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:43,000
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL.

4061
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:44,000
>> Gretchen: THAT MIGHT BE MORE

4062
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:45,000
PRIVATE.
>> IT WOULD BE PRIVATE, BUT ALL

4063
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:46,000
OF THAT IS PRIVATE.

4064
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:49,000
SO NOW WE HAVE A SITUATION IN

4065
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
THIS COUNTRY WHERE YES, THERE

4066
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
SHOULD BE SOME LIMITATIONS ON

4067
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
WHAT GOES ON IN PUBLIC

4068
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:56,000
FACILITIES.

4069
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:57,000
WE SEE IN AIRPORTS.

4070
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
WE SEE IT IN CERTAIN CABS WHERE

4071
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
THEY HAVE CAMERAS.

4072
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:04,000
BUT NOW OUR CONVERSATION WILL BE

4073
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:05,000
MONITORED.

4074
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:06,000
>> Gretchen: IS IT LEGAL?

4075
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
>> IN THE END IT MAY BE LEGAL.

4076
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
IN THE END, THE GOVERNMENT MAY

4077
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
FIND A WAY AROUND THE FOURTH

4078
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:13,000
AMENDMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE

4079
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:14,000
SAYING, WE'RE GIVING YOU WARNING

4080
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
THAT WE'RE LISTENING TO YOU.

4081
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY IS IT WHERE

4082
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
WE SAY, IT'S OKAY TO LISTEN TO

4083
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:23,000
YOU BECAUSE WE'VE TOLD YOU THAT

4084
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
WE'RE GOING TO LISTEN TO YOU?

4085
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:28,000
HOW FAR IS THE STANDARD BEING

4086
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
DEVIATED THAT WE'RE SAYING,

4087
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:31,000
YEAH, WE CAN ACCEPT THAT?

4088
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
WHAT DO WE ACCEPT NEXT?

4089
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
IN LIBRARIES, IN DOCTORS'

4090
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:38,000
OFFICES?
DO WE ACCEPT IT IN THE STUDIOS

4091
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
AND IN THE OFFICES OF FOX NEWS

4092
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
OR NBC NEWS?

4093
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:46,000
WHERE DO WE LIMIT THIS IN TERMS

4094
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:47,000
OF EAVESDROPPING?

4095
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
AND TO SAY, OKAY, WE NEED TO

4096
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:50,000
PROTECT OUR BUS DRIVERS.

4097
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:53,000
I AGREE.
BUT AT WHAT COST DO WE DO THAT?

4098
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
IS VIDEO ENOUGH, AS YOU SAY?

4099
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:56,000
>> Gretchen: LET ME ASK YOU

4100
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:59,000
THIS, WHAT KIND OF WARNING --

4101
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:00,000
BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE, I'M

4102
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
THINKING OF DRUG WARNINGS.

4103
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:03,000
THEY SAY THEM REALLY, REALLY

4104
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
FAST AT THEnd OF TV

4105
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,000
COMMERCIALS OR REALLY, REALLY

4106
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:07,000
TINY FINE PRINT.

4107
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:08,000
WHAT KIND OF WARNING --

4108
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:11,000
>> THERE ARE SIGNS UP ON THESE

4109
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:12,000
BUSES THAT SAY YOUR CONVERSATION

4110
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
IS GOING TO BE LISTENED TO.

4111
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:17,000
BUT SHOULD WE SIT IN SILENCE ON

4112
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:18,000
THE BUS?

4113
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
THE BUS,  WHICH IS THE HALLMARK

4114
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
OF CIVIL RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY,

4115
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:23,000
REMEMBER ROSA PARKS?

4116
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
YOU CAN GO TO A MUSEUM IN DEAR

4117
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:28,000
BORN, MICHIGAN AND SEE THAT BUS,

4118
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:29,000
ABOUT GOING TO THE BACK OF THE

4119
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:30,000
BUS.

4120
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
DO WE ALL NOW SIT SILENTLY ON

4121
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:33,000
THE BUS BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID

4122
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:34,000
THAT OUR GOVERNMENT IS LISTENING

4123
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:37,000
TO OUR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

4124
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
GROCERIES, ABOUT FAMILY

4125
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:40,000
PROBLEMS, ABOUT DATE NIGHT,

4126
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:43,000
