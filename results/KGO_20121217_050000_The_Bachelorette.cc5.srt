COMING UP--ASHLEY AND J.P.

343
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
WHEN THEY MEET
WITH THEIR WEDDING PLANNER

344
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

often comes with a set

353
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
of equally impressive
instructions ?

354
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Shouldn't something
that's truly advanced,

355
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
not need much explanation
at all ?

356
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
With the Nokia Lumia 822
on Verizon,

357
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
there's not much to learn

358
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
because it's
powered by Windows...

359
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000

I made the clear choice.

373
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
WELCOME BACK
TO THIS SPECIAL EDITION

378
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
OF "THE BACHELOR:
ASHLEY & J.P.'s WEDDING."

379
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
THERE'S A LOT
GOING ON HERE TODAY

380
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
AT THE LANGHAM HUNTINGTON HOTEL
IN PASADENA,

381
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
AS THE FINAL PREPARATIONS
FOR THE WEDDING

382
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
ARE STILL TAKING PLACE.

383
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
AND ASHLEY AND J.P. FOUND OUT
JUST HOW COMPLICATED

384
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
PLANNING THE PERFECT WEDDING
CAN BE

385
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
WHEN THEY MET
WITH THEIR WEDDING PLANNER

386
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

387
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
♪

388
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
ARE YOU EXCITED?

389
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS
TO MEET MINDY.

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
REALLY? WHY?

391
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I DON'T KNOW.
IT SEEMS LIKE A BIG DEAL.

392
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
SHE IS A BIG DEAL,
KINDA LIKE YOU.

393
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
YEAH, TRUE.
(laughs)

394
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
J.P. MIGHT LET ON LIKE
HE'S NOT INTO WEDDING PLANNING

395
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
AND DECOR AND DESIGN,

396
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
BUT I ACTUALLY THINK THAT HE'S
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO TODAY.

397
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
THIS IS OUR DAY,
BUT IT'S HER DAY,

398
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
AND I WANT HER TO GET EVERYTHING
THAT SHE WANTS.

399
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
LET'S GET THIS STARTED.
WE'RE SO EXCITED TO MEET YOU.

400
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
MINDY WEISS
IS OUR WEDDING PLANNER,

401
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
AND SHE'S DONE WEDDINGS
FOR ELLEN DeGENERES,

402
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
GWEN STEFANI,
AND SO MANY MORE CELEBRITIES.

403
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'M SO EXCITED TO TELL HER
ALL OF OUR IDEAS.

404
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE CEREMONY A LITTLE...

405
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
OKAY.
JUST TO GET YOUR VISION.

406
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'VE DONE HUNDREDS OF WEDDINGS,
AND I ALWAYS LOVE TO SEE--

407
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
ARE THEY GONNA BE
ON THE SAME PAGE?

408
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
ARE THEY GONNA DISAGREE?

409
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
SO THIS IS KIND OF A TEST
TO SEE WHAT THEIR VISIONS ARE

410
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
AND HOW THEY'RE GONNA HANDLE
THEIR DIFFERENCES.

411
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
WHAT IS
YOUR PERSONAL STYLE?

412
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
YOU KNOW, I DON'T LIKE
TOO MANY PATTERNS,

413
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
OR I DON'T LIKE ANYTHING
THAT'S TOO BUSY.

414
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I LIKE SIMPLE, CLEAN.
SO VERY...

415
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
FEMININE, NEUTRAL.

416
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
AND THEN HOW DO
WE MIX YOU IN THERE?

417
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
YEAH.

418
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'M LOW-MAINTENANCE.
UM, I'M EASY TO PLEASE.

419
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
AND WHEN HER FACE LIGHTS UP
EXPLAINING THIS STUFF,

420
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
IT GETS ME EXCITED ABOUT IT.
OH, THAT'S SO AWESOME. YEAH.

421
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.
YEAH.

422
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
AND WHAT ABOUT COLORS?

423
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
IN MY HEAD, I HAD
A VISION OF A CHAMPAGNE

424
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
IN A VERY, VERY LIGHT--
NOT PINK...
BUT...

425
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
BUT LIKE A DUSTY ROSE.

426
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
WITH JUST A LITTLE COLOR
IN THERE.

427
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
LITTLE COLOR, YEAH.
OKAY.
YOU GOOD WITH THAT?

428
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
SOFT. SOFT.
I AM GOOD WITH THAT.

429
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
OKAY.
(Ashley) SO FAR, SO GOOD.

430
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW WELL
THIS MEETING'S GOING.

431
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
NOW THAT I'M HERE WITH MINDY,
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS GONNA BE

432
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
A WHOLE LOT EASIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

433
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
AS FAR AS--ARE YOU GONNA
HAVE A CHUPPAH,

434
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
OR DO YOU WANT IT?

435
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
ARE YOU GONNA BRING IN SOME
OF THE JEWISH TRADITIONS?

436
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
YES, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CHUPPAH.
RIGHT.

437
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
UH, WE'LL DO
THE BREAKING OF THE GLASS.

438
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
OH, GOOD.

439
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
DO YOU HAVE BRIDESMAIDS?
YES.

440
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
HOW MANY BRIDESMAIDS?

441
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I THINK WE SETTLED ON NINE.
NINE ON EACH SIDE.

442
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
OKAY.
AND WE WOULD LOVE FOR OUR DOG
TO BE A PART OF IT.

443
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
SHE'S A LITTLE YORKIE,
ABOUT 4 POUNDS, REALLY SWEET.

444
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
WHAT'S HER NAME?

445
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
BOO.
OF COURSE IT IS.

446
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
(both laugh)

447
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
WE KNOW ALL THE PIECES,

448
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW
TO PUT 'EM TOGETHER.

449
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
THAT'S WHY MINDY'S HERE.

450
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
AND HOW OLD
ARE THE FLOWER GIRLS?

451
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
UM, 6 AND 8.

452
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
DO YOU WANT THE WEDDING PARTY
TO STAND UP THERE?

453
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I THINK SO. WE HAVEN'T
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

454
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
AND HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT YOUR FIRST DANCE

455
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
AND WHAT YOU MIGHT WANNA...

456
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'M STARTING TO REALIZE THAT
THERE ARE WHOLE LOT OF THINGS

457
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN CONSIDERED.

458
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE HARDER
THAN WE THOUGHT.

459
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT WOOD TABLES?

460
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
DO YOU LIKE THAT LOOK?
OH, I LIKE THAT.

461
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
YOU LOVE A DEEJAY
AS OPPOSED TO A BAND?

462
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK
OF THAT OPTION.
MAYBE YOU START OFF
WITH A BAND.

463
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
AND WERE YOU THINKING AT ALL
ABOUT A PARTY FAVOR?

464
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
IS THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU?

465
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
AH, THIS IS--
THIS IS YOUR CALL.

466
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
AS FAR AS THE CAKE,
I NEED PICTURES.

467
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
WHAT KIND OF FOOD
DO YOU WANNA SERVE?

468
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT,
LIKE, WHAT YOU MIGHT LIKE

469
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
TO GIVE
TO YOUR WEDDING PARTY?

470
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
(sighs) (bleep)

471
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
THIS IS GOOD.
I CAN ALREADY TELL.
YEAH.

472
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
THIS IS GOOD. YEAH.

473
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
♪

474
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
WOW. IT'S ALL BECOMING
SO REAL.

475
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I KNOW. TODAY IT WAS
KIND OF A STEPPING-STONE,

476
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
LIKE... TO MEET MINDY
AND THE WEDDING INVITATIONS,

477
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
AND... IT'S--IT'S ALL
STARTING TO COME TOGETHER.

478
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
ARE YOU NERVOUS?
NO.

479
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
ARE YOU GETTING COLD FEET,
BABE?
NEVER.

480
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
(laughs)
THAT'S ONE THING ABOUT THIS--

481
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
ABOUT EVERYTHING
THAT WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH.

482
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I HAVE NEVER BEEN NERVOUS
ABOUT US FOR A SECOND.

483
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'M HAPPIER THAN I'VE EVER BEEN
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

484
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
AW. THANKS, BABE.

485
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I REALLY, HONESTLY
CANNOT WAIT TO MARRY YOU.

486
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
AND I CAN'T WAIT ALSO.

487
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I LOVE YOU.
(clink)

488
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

489
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
WE LOVE EACH OTHER SO MUCH,
BUT WE'RE SO PLAYFUL,

490
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
THAT I CANNOT WAIT TO JUST BE
STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM

491
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
IN FRONT OF
ALL OF OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY

492
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
AND DECLARING MY LOVE TO HIM

493
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
IN THE MOST SERIOUS
AND ROMANTIC AND SINCERE WAY.

494
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
DO YOU REMEMBER...

495
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
WHAT WE DID IN TAIWAN?

496
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
A LITTLE BIT
OF FORESHADOWING.

497
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
OH, MY GOODNESS.

498
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
(J.P.) ONE OF OUR GROUP DATES
ON "THE BACHELORETTE"

499
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
WAS IN TAIWAN, WHERE WE WENT
AND TOOK WEDDING PHOTOS,

500
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
AND I KNEW I LIKED HER.

501
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I MEAN, I KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

502
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
DO YOU THINK
THAT THIS IS GONNA--

503
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
OH! (laughs)

504
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
THAT OUR WEDDING PICTURES
ARE GONNA COME OUT THE SAME?
OH, MY GOSH, BABY!

505
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
IS THIS OUR UNOFFICIAL
WEDDING PICTURE? (laughs)
IT KINDA IS.

506
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
DID YOU KNOW AT THAT POINT?

507
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
YOU COULD SAY "NO."

508
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
YES.
YEAH.

509
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000

1187
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
DOES IT LOOK ODDLY FAMILIAR?

1188
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
IT'S CLEARLY
NOT AS PINK.

1189
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
(laughs)
RIGHT?

1190
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
THERE'S NO SUCH THING.

1191
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
OURS WAS WAY MORE PINK
THAN THIS.

1192
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT ASHLEY AND J.P.?

1193
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE SPENT
A LITTLE TIME TOGETHER.

1194
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I-I JUST--I ADORE HER.

1195
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
RIGHT.
SHE'S JUST PURE JOY.

1196
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
YEAH.
AND I HAD REALLY HIGH HOPES
FOR ASHLEY AND J.P.,

1197
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
AND NOW WE'RE HERE.

1198
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
YOU KINDA SENSE YOURSELF
IN THEM A LITTLE BIT.

1199
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
(both) YEAH.
AND OBVIOUSLY
A MUCH, MUCH YOUNGER SELF.

1200
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
FOR SURE.
BUT I'M REALLY--
I'M VERY HOPEFUL FOR THEM.

1201
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I'M JUST REALLY,
REALLY HAPPY FOR THEM

1202
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
AND HAPPY TO BE HERE.

1203
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
YOU KNOW THAT, UH,
WE HAVE A NEW BACHELOR.

1204
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
YES.
SEAN--ABOUT TO START
HIS JOURNEY.

1205
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
RIGHT.
UM, THOUGHTS?

1206
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
LOVE HIM.
YEAH?

1207
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
YES. MM-HMM.
(laughs)

1208
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
HE IS PRETTY TO LOOK AT.
UM, NO.

1209
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I-I JUST THINK
HE'S A QUALITY GUY.

1210
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
HE SEEMS LIKE VERY GENTLE,

1211
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
KIND OF LIKE RYAN.

1212
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
SO I'M--I'M REALLY HOPING THAT--
THAT HE FOUND SOMEONE.

1213
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I KNOW YOU'LL BE WATCHING.
WILL YOU WATCH EVER?

1214
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
EVERY NOW AND THEN, IF I WANNA
SPEND TIME WITH MY WIFE

1215
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
ON MONDAY NIGHTS

1216
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
OR WHATEVER NIGHT THEY HAPPEN
TO CHOOSE THIS WEEK.

1217
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I-I ACTUALLY DO ENJOY
WATCHING IT.

1218
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
IT'S, YOU KNOW, SO MANY
MEMORIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH IT

1219
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
IN OUR LIVES.

1220
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
GUYS, ALWAYS GOOD SEEING YOU.
GREAT HANGING WITH YOU,

1221
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
AND FROM ALL OF US,
HAPPY NINTH ANNIVERSARY TO YOU.

1222
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
THANKS.
THANKS.

1223
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
AW.
HOPEFULLY TODAY WILL GO
AS SMOOTHLY AS YOURS DID

1224
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
NINE YEARS AGO.

1225
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
ASHLEY AND J.P. ARE
ABOUT TO GET MARRIED,

1226
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
AND I HAVE TO SAY
I AM VERY HONORED

1227
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
TO BE THE ONE MARRYING THEM.

1228
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
YES, I WILL BE OFFICIATING
THEIR WEDDING TODAY.

1229
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO ADMIT
THAT I HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS

1230
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
FOR THE COUPLE THAT NEEDED
TO BE ANSWERED FIRST.

1231
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
♪

1232
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
YOU GUYS ASKED ME
TO OFFICIATE THIS WEDDING.

1233
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
MM-HMM.
UM...

1234
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
FIRST OF ALL, WHY?
(both laugh)

1235
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I'M VERY--I'M VERY HONORED,
UH, BUT--BUT WHY?

1236
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
WHAT--WHAT BROUGHT YOU
TO THAT?

1237
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
WE SPOKE IN DEPTH ABOUT IT,

1238
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
AND YOU WERE AT THE TOP
OF OUR LIST

1239
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
ALMOST FROM DAY ONE.

1240
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
WE JUST FEEL VERY, VERY
COMFORTABLE WITH YOU UP THERE.

1241
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
ONE THING WE WANT
IN OUR CEREMONY

1242
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
IS WE WANT IT TO BE HEARTFELT.
WE WANT IT TO BE PERSONAL,

1243
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
AND WE WANTED SOMEBODY
THAT KNEW US.

1244
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
TOGETHER.

1245
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE BEST ADVICE.

1246
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
YOU'VE KNOWN US FROM THE START
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP,

1247
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
AND EVEN AFTER THE SHOW
WAS OVER,

1248
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
WE MAINTAINED THIS RELATIONSHIP.
RIGHT.

1249
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
(voice breaks)
VERY SPECIAL TO ME. (laughs)

1250
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
YOU KNOW I CRY ALL THE TIME.
(laughs)
I KNOW YOU DO.

1251
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
UM, AND AS MUCH
AS I LOVE YOU GUYS,

1252
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
IT'S LIKE I DON'T WANT TO DO IT
AS THE HOST OF "THE BACHELOR."

1253
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
NO.
NO, NO.

1254
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
WE REALLY DON'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL THAT WAY, BECAUSE...
YEAH.

1255
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
THAT IS--COULDN'T BE ANYTHING
FURTHER FROM--FROM THE TRUTH.

1256
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
WE WANT YOU THERE AS A FRIEND,

1257
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
AS SOMEBODY
THAT WE'VE ALWAYS TRUSTED--

1258
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
SOMEBODY THAT'S ALWAYS,
YOU KNOW, BEEN ON OUR SIDE,

1259
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS US
EACH PERSONALLY,

1260
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
INDIVIDUALLY AND TOGETHER.

1261
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
YOU KNOW I LOVE
THE TWO OF YOU.

1262
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I LOVE THE TWO OF YOU
TOGETHER.

1263
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I CONSIDER BOTH OF YOU
VERY DEAR FRIENDS,

1264
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
BUT I JUST REALLY
WANNA MAKE SURE

1265
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
YOU TWO ARE TRULY COMMITTED
TO WHAT MARRIAGE MEANS,

1266
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
AND SO I WANNA ASK YOU GUYS
SOME QUESTIONS

1267
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
AND TALK TO YOU GUYS
AS A COUPLE.
ABSOLUTELY.

1268
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
DO YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU KNOW EACH OTHER?

1269
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU FEEL
LIKE HE MAY NOT KNOW?

1270
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I'M NOT GOOD WITH THIS
KIND OF STUFF.

1271
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
OKAY, HOLD ON.
WHAT DON'T YOU KNOW?

1272
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
WAIT. HOLD ON. THIS IS TOUGH.
(laughs) IT IS.

1273
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I FEEL LIKE I KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.
SOMEBODY YOU DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ME.

1274
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
WHAT--WHAT IS--
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU

1275
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
AS YOUR WEDDING COMES UP?

1276
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
BUT THAT'S SUCH AN AMBIGU--
THAT'S, LIKE, SET--

1277
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I MEAN, THAT'S SUCH
A BLANKET STATEMENT.
WAIT. BUT SHOULDN'T I--

1278
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
SHOULDN'T I--I SHOULD
KNOW THAT ALREADY.

1279
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
WHAT ARE THE THINGS
THAT MAKE YOU GUYS

1280
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
TALK AND WORRY AND DISCUSS
AND...

1281
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
WE REALLY DON'T WORRY ABOUT...
US.

1282
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
DO YOU KNOW AND TRUST
WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT

1283
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
THIS PERSON IS HERE
FOR YOU?

1284
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
OH. I NEVER QUESTION THAT.
DO YOU EVER QUESTION THAT?

1285
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
NOT FOR A SECOND.

1286
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
YOU NEVER WORRIED
ABOUT JEALOUSY?

1287
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
WORRIED ABOUT...
NEVER. NEVER.

1288
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I'VE NEVER HAD A DOUBT.

1289
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I'VE NEVER HAD A MOMENT OF...
INSECURITY OR JEALOUSY.

1290
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I MEAN, NEVER.
DO YOU EVER HAVE--

1291
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
NO, AND IT'S SUCH
A... RELIEF.
IT'S WEIRD.

1292
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I MEAN, YES, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE OBSTACLES,

1293
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
BUT I'VE NEVER DOUBTED
HER FEELINGS FOR ME.

1294
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
IT JUST--
IT JUST FEELS RIGHT.

1295
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
BUT WHEN LIFE DOES SET IN,

1296
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
AND LIFE HAS SET IN
FOR YOU GUYS,

1297
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
THERE'S ISSUES.
WHAT ARE THEY?

1298
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
YOU KNOW WHEN MY SISTER
HAD SOME ISSUES WITH J.P.?
RIGHT.

1299
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
SHE SAID WE WERE TOO DIFFERENT.

1300
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
HE'S OLDER,
AND HE'S FROM NEW YORK.

1301
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
HE'S JUST DIFFERENT.
YEAH.

1302
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
WE GET IT.
WE ARE VERY, VERY DIFFERENT.
SHE'S RIGHT.

1303
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
BUT WE BALANCE EACH OTHER OUT.

1304
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
SO IS THAT RIGHT?
SHE'S HIT THE NAIL
ON THE HEAD. ABSOLUTELY.

1305
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
SHE'S THE STRONGEST WOMAN
I KNOW.

1306
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I MEAN, THIS GIRL--ANY ADVERSITY
THAT'S THROWN IN FRONT OF HER,

1307
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
SHE CAN HANDLE. SHE CAN HANDLE
ENOUGH FOR THE BOTH OF US.

1308
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I JUST--I LOVE HER STRENGTH.
I LOVE HER SINCERITY.

1309
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
YEAH.
I MEAN, I CAN GO ON AND ON
AND ON ABOUT HER.

1310
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I MEAN, SHE'S A CONSTANT
UPLIFTING PRESENCE.

1311
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
YOU KNOW, THERE'S THAT CLICHE,
"WHEN YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW."

1312
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
RIGHT.
BUT IT'S SO TRUE.

1313
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
LIKE, WHEN YOU KNOW,
YOU KNOW.

1314
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU FEEL
IS RIGHT.

1315
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I MEAN,
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY,

1316
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
EVEN, YOU KNOW,
THE PROPOSAL,

1317
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
EVERYONE COMMENTS,
"WHOA, YOU PROPOSED SO SOON."

1318
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
BUT IT JUST FELT RIGHT.

1319
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
THIS FEELS RIGHT. SHE'S WHO
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE WITH,

1320
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
AND--AND THAT'S
THE BEST ANSWER I CAN GIVE.

1321
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
WHAT'S THAT FEELING
FOR YOU?

1322
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I THINK THERE ARE
A LOT OF THINGS IN LIFE

1323
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
THAT THE BRAIN
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

1324
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
BUT THE HEART FEELS,
AND I THINK THAT--

1325
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
GOOD ANSWER.

1326
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
(laughs) AND I THINK THAT
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE HAVE,

1327
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
AND THERE'S NOBODY IN THE WORLD
I RATHER BE WITH THAN HIM.

1328
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
LIKE, THROUGH THE GOOD,
THE BAD, THE UGLY.

1329
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
LIKE,
EVERYTHING THAT WE GO THROUGH,

1330
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
THERE'S--I THINK
WHEN YOU CAN SAY THAT,

1331
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
THEN YOU'VE REALLY--
YOU'VE REALLY FIGURED IT OUT.

1332
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
HAVE YOU GUYS TALKED
ABOUT NUMBER OF KIDS? WHEN?

1333
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
TWO.
ONE.

1334
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
NO. WE DON'T KNOW. PROBABLY--
WE'LL PROBABLY

1335
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
HOPEFULLY HAVE TWO, BUT I MEAN,
I DEFINITELY HAVE BABY FEVER.

1336
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

1337
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
THAT IS THE UNDERSTATEMENT
OF THE CENTURY.
(laughs)

1338
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
HOW SOON?

1339
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
AND HOW--
A YEAR?

1340
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
YEAR AND A HALF?
I DON'T KNOW. HOPEFULLY.

1341
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
AND YOU'RE... ON BOARD?
IT--ALL--ALL'S KIND OF
A GREAT PLAN.

1342
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
YEAH.
AND WHEN THINGS CHANGE,
THEY CHANGE,

1343
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
BUT RIGHT NOW SHE'LL FINISH
HER RESIDENCY,

1344
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
HAVE A KID.
MM-HMM.

1345
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
AND SHE'LL GET ON

I landed on my keys.

Did you get that?

1891
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Oh yeah.
That was amazing.

1892

Walk it off Santa.

Share videos instantly

1897
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
On the Galaxy SIII

1898
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
For a limited time get two flip
covers for the price of one.

1899
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Exclusively at Verizon.

1900
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
I made the clear choice.

1901
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
I'm getting Claritin Clear
with Claritin-D.

1902
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Nasal congestion keep me away ?

1903
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Not since I made
the clear choice.

1904
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Non-drowsy Claritin-D.

1905
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Decongestant products on
the shelf can take hours

1906
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
to start working.

1907
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Claritin-D starts to work
in just 30 minutes.

1908
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I can't wait hours for
a nasal decongestant.

1909
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
That's why I made the clear
choice and got Claritin-D.

1910
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
It has the best
decongestant for colds.

1911
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,000
This cold season, get Claritin-D
at the pharmacy counter.

1912
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Live Claritin Clear.

1913
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000

01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,000
JUST ONE BRIEF DAY IN TIME,

1920
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
AND ALTHOUGH YOUR VOWS ARE
SPOKEN IN A MATTER OF MINUTES,

1921
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,000
THEY ARE PROMISES
THAT WILL LAST A LIFETIME.

1922
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,000
AND THINGS WILL NEVER QUITE
BE THE SAME BETWEEN YOU,

01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,000
FOR AFTER THESE VOWS,
YOU SHALL SAY TO THE WORLD,

1924
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
"THIS IS MY HUSBAND."

1925
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:48,000
"THIS IS MY WIFE."

1926
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
NOW ASHLEY AND J.P.
WILL READ VOWS

1927
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,000
THEY'VE PREPARED FOR EACH OTHER.

1928
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
WHO'S GOING FIRST?

1929
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
(whispers) J.P.

1930
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I'LL GO FIRST.

1931
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,000
(speaks indistinctly)
WHATEVER YOU...

1932
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I HAVE TO ADMIT I WAS NEVER
A BIG BELIEVER IN FATE.

1933
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
NEVER THOUGHT
THAT ONE WOMAN AND ONE MAN

1934
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,000
WERE PUT ON THIS WORLD
TO MEET EACH OTHER...

1935
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
(exhales deeply)
AND THEN I MET YOU.

1936
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,000
(sniffles)
WHAT ARE THE ODDS

1937
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
THAT A SMALL-TOWN GIRL
FROM SOMEWHERE--

1938
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
YOU GOTTA HOLD IT TOGETHER,
'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA

1939
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
HOLD IT TOGETHER FOR YOU.
(laughter)

1940
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
SORRY. (chuckles)

1941
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
WHAT ARE--

1942
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
WHAT ARE THE ODDS
THAT A SMALL-TOWN GIRL

1943
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
FROM SOMEWHERE
CLOSE TO THE NORTH POLE...

1944
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
(laughter)
WOULD EVER, EVER FIND
AND FALL IN LOVE

1945
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
WITH A BORN-AND-BRED
NEW YORKER?

1946
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
IF THAT'S NOT
AN EXAMPLE OF FATE,

1947
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

1948
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
ASHLEY, YOU ARE
THE KINDEST, WARMEST,

1949
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
MOST BEAUTIFUL PERSON,
INSIDE AND OUT,

1950
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
I HAVE EVER KNOWN.

1951
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:03,000
AND YOU MAKE ME, BY FAR,
A MUCH, MUCH BETTER MAN.

1952
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
I CAN'T PICTURE MY LIFE
WITHOUT YOU.

1953
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
(sniffles)

1954
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
EVERY SINGLE DAY,
I HAVE ASKED MYSELF

1955
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE
SOMEONE LIKE YOU?

1956
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
WELL, THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS
I PROBABLY DON'T DESERVE YOU,

1957
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
BUT NOW THAT I'VE GOT YOU,

1958
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
NOW THAT WE'VE FOUND EACH OTHER
AND FALLEN IN LOVE,

1959
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:28,000
I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT I WILL
NEVER, EVER LET YOU GO.

1960
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:33,000
(exhales deeply)

1961
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
(exhales deeply)

1962
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,000
NOT ONLY ARE YOU
MY ONE TRUE LOVE,

1963
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
BUT YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

1964
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,000
YOU ARE
MY ABSOLUTE EVERYTHING.

1965
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
AND I PROMISE TO CHERISH
OUR LOVE AND YOU

1966
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,000
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

1967
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
(whispers)
I LOVE YOU, TOO, BABY.

1968
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
(exhales deeply)
(exhales deeply)

1969
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
J.P...

1970
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,000
FROM THE FIRST TIME WE MET,
MY HEART HAS BEEN DRAWN TO YOU.

1971
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:12,000
WITH EACH GLANCE, YOUR SPARKLY
SMILE ENLIGHTENS MY LIFE,

1972
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
AND I PROMISE
TO LOOK AT IT EACH DAY

1973
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:19,000
AND REMEMBER
THAT NO MATTER WHAT...

1974
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
NO MATTER WHAT,

1975
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
HAPPINESS WILL ALWAYS LIE
WITHIN US.

1976
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
YOUR DEDICATION TO FAMILY

1977
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
AND OUR FUTURE FAMILY
INSPIRES ME

1978
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
AND REMINDS ME
THAT RELATIONSHIPS ARE

1979
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN LIFE.

1980
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
I PROMISE
TO NEVER FORGET THIS.

1981
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:39,000
THE WAY YOU KEEP UP
WITH MY UNSTOPPABLE ENERGY,

1982
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
SOMETIMES
NOT-SO-FUNNY JOKES...

ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOST

2203
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
IS ASHLEY AND J.P.
HAVING CHILDREN.

2204
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I WANT MORE COUSINS
IN THE FAMILY.

2205
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I WANT MORE CHRISTMASES
AND THANKSGIVINGS

2206
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
AND MORE FAMILY REUNIONS.

I JUST LOOK FORWARD
TO EVERYTHING

2208
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,000
THAT'S TO COME FOR THEM.

2209
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
(Jillian) WHEN YOU MEET SOMEBODY
LIKE ASHLEY AND J.P.,

2210
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:02,000
YOU ONLY WISH HAPPINESS.

2211
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
WHATEVER YOU FEEL TONIGHT,
WHICH IS THAT ENERGY AND LOVE,

2212
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I WANT THAT TO BE WITH THEM
UNTIL THE DAY THEY DIE,

2213
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,000
YOU KNOW, FOREVER.

2214

WELL,
THE PARTY CONTINUES INSIDE,

2217
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
WE HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

2218
