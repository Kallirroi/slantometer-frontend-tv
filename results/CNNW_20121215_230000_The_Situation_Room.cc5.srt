1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
PARKING LOT WAS FULL, WOLF, WE

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
SAW FAMILIES GOING IN.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
WE DIDN'T FILM THEM, OBVIOUSLY

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
FOR PRIVACY.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
BUT PSYCHOLOGISTS,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
PSYCHIATRISTS, CHILD COUNSELORS.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE WERE

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
TELLING US WAS THAT THIS IDEA

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
THAT THE COMMUNITY ITSELF COULD

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
BE A SOURCE OF HEALING.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
JUST SIMPLY KNOWING THAT PEOPLE

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
WERE SEEKING COUNSELING AND WERE

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
ALL GOING THROUGH IT TOGETHER

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
ALSO PROVIDED A LOT OF COMFORT

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
TO THESE PEOPLE.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
SO I THINK THAT IS WHY THEY

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
DECIDED TO DO THIS HERE.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
>> SANJAY, STAY WITH ME, DON'T
GO AWAY HERE.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
AN UNIMAGINABLE TRAGEDY, GROWING

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
EVEN MORE HORRIFYING WITH EVERY

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
GRUESOME NEW DETAIL WE LEARN.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
>> EVERYBODY, DEATH WAS CAUSED

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
BY -- EVERYONE WE HAVE COMPLETED

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
SO FAR WAS CAUSED BY GUNSHOT

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
WOUNDS.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
AND OBVIOUSLY, THE MANNER OF

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
DEATH ON ALL OF THESE CASES HAS

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
BEEN CLASSIFIED AS HOMICIDE.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
>> A LONG TIME MEDICAL EXAMINER

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
CALLS IT PROBABLY THE WORST

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
THING HE HAS EVER SEEN IN MORE

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
THAN 30 YEARS IN THIS FIELD.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
MOST EVERYBODY HIT MORE THAN

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
ONCE.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
EACH WITH A SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE,

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
AND THIS.
>> WHEN I SAW THOSE TEACHERS AND

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I LOCKED EYES WITH EACH OF THEM

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
SEPARATELY, WHEN I FOUND THE TWO

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
CHILDREN IF I COULD GO BACK I

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
WOULD -- I WOULD EMBRACE THEM.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
HAD GONE THROUGH.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
>> THE PARENTS OF CHILDREN WHO

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
SURVIVED THE SHOOTING STRUGGLE

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT THEIR

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
CHILDREN AND THE TEACHERS HAD TO

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
ENDURE AS WE LEARN THE NAMES OF

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
ALL 26 PEOPLE KILLED.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
NOT ONE OF THOSE 20 CHILDREN WHO

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
DIED OVER THE AGE OF SEVEN YEARS

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
OLD.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
THEY WERE SIX AND SEVEN YEARS

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
OLD, ALL FIRST GRADERS.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
WE WANT TO WELCOME OUR VIEWERS

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
THE WORLD.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'M WOLF BLITZER, REPORTING HERE

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
FROM NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
LET'S BRING IN OUR NATIONAL

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
CORRESPONDENT, SUSAN CANDIOTTI.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
SHE IS JOINING US WITH MORE

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
INFORMATION, THE VERY LATEST ON

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
THE INVESTIGATION, WHAT ARE YOU

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
LEARNING, SUSAN?

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
>> Reporter: HI, WOLF, WE'RE NOT

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
GOING TO DWELL ON THE SHOOTER'S

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
NAME, BUT HE IS TWENTY-YEAR-OLD

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
ADAM LANZA, AND WE'RE LEARNING

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
TODAY MORE ON HOW VICIOUS THE

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
ATTACKS WERE.

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
THIS INFORMATION COMING TO US

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
FROM THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
>> ALL THE WOUNDS THAT I KNOW OF

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
AT THIS POINT WERE CAUSED BY THE

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
WEAPON.

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I ONLY DID SEVEN OF THE

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
AUTOPSIES.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
THE VICTIMS I HAD RANGED FROM

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
THREE TO ELEVEN, AND I ONLY SAW

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
TWO OF THEM WITH CLOSE RANGE

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
SHOOTING.
THIS IS A SAMPLE, I REALLY DON'T

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
HAVE MORE INFORMATION.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
THE BULLETS ARE DESIGNED IN SUCH

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
A FASHION THAT THE ENERGY --

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
THIS IS VERY CLINICAL, I

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
SHOULDN'T BE SAYING THIS.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
BUT THE ENERGY DEPOSITED IN THE

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
TISSUE, SO THE BULLET STAYS IN.

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
>> Reporter: NOW THE LONG WEAPON

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
THAT THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
REFERRED TO IS ONE OF THE THREE

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
GUNS THAT OUR SOURCES TELL US

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
WERE FOUND NEXT TO THE SHOOTER

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
IN THE CLASSROOM.

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
YOU'LL REMEMBER THOSE THREE, TWO

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
OF THEM HANDGUNS, AND THE THIRD

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
A LONGGUN, THAT WE HAVE COME TO

98
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
KNOW AS A SEMIAUTOMATIC CALLED A

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
BUSHWHACKER, NOW -- I'M SORRY --

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I UNDERSTAND THERE MAY BE A

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
TECHNICAL PROBLEM.

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
>> SUSAN I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
YOU FOR A MOMENT.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
BECAUSE THE BROTHER OF NANCY

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
LANZA, THE MOTHER OF THE

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
SHOOTER, THE BROTHER, JAMES

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
CHAMPION IS SPEAKING NOW IN NEW

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
HAMPSHIRE.
HE IS A POLICE OFFICER.

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
>> IS INVOLVED IN, IS GOING TO

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
GO THROUGH THE COUNNNECTICUT STE

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
POLICE, AND THE LOCAL POLICE.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
SO YOU WON'T HAVE ANY

113
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
INFORMATION COMING FROM ANY
DEPARTMENT IN THIS COUNTY ABOUT

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
WHAT THEY'RE DOING ON BEHALF OF

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
CONNECTICUT.

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I CAN -- THINK I CAN SAY THAT

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT HERE IS
RESPONDING TO ANY REQUESTS THAT

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
CONNECTICUT COULD MAKE.

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
AND WE WILL DO ANYTHING THAT IS

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
ASKED OF US TO ASSIST ON THAT.

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
THE ROCKINGHAM COUNTY SHERIFF,

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
MIKE DOWNING IS HERE WITH ME.

HE HAS A STATEMENT FROM THE

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
CHAMPION FAMILY HE WOULD LIKE TO

125
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
READ.

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
AND WE -- AFTER THAT, I GUESS WE

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
CAN TRY AND ANSWER QUESTIONS,

128
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
ALTHOUGH WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
INVESTIGATION IN GENERAL.

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
SO I'LL TURN IT OVER TO SHERIFF

132
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
DOWNING.

STATEMENT.

138
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
BUT HE DECIDED HE COULDN'T

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
BECAUSE IT IS TOO EMOTIONAL.

140
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
WE'RE HEARING NOW FROM HIS

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
SHE WAS VERY INVOLVED IN THE

188
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
COMMUNITY.

189
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
VERY WELL RESPECTED.

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
>> CHIEF, CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

191
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
CHAMPIONS IN GENERAL, WELL KNOWN

192
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
IN TOWN?

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
>> I CAN TELL YOU, SMALL TOWN,

194
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
THAT MRS. CHAMPION, DOTTIE,

195
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
WORKED AS A SCHOOL NURSE AT THE

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
SCHOOL FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

197
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
A WONDERFUL PERSON, VERY GOOD

198
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
WITH CHILDREN.

199
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
JIM CHAMPION WORKED FOR ME FOR A

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
NUMBER OF YEARS AS THE CAPTAIN

201
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
AND HE CURRENTLY WORKS FOR ME AS

203
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
A PART-TIME OFFICER AS WELL AS

204
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
FOR SHERIFF DOWNING AS A DEPUTY.

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
>> HAVE YOU SPOKEN MUCH TO HIM

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
SINCE HE HAS HEARD THIS NEWS?

207
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT

208
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
HOW HE IS DOING?

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
>> THE WHOLE FAMILY IS TRAU

210
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
TRAUMATIZED BY THIS EVENT, VERY

211
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
SAD, VERY SAD.

212
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
>> DO YOU KNOW IF HE WAS IN
CONTACT, HAS HE EXPRESSED

213
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
ANYTHING -- ANYTHING --

214
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
>> I'M SORRY I DIDN'T HEAR.

215
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I HAVE NOT.

216
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
>> CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT --
>> HE HAS NOT.

217
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
>> WHAT DOES HE SAY ABOUT --

218
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
THIS DAY.

219
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
>> I HAVE NOT HAD A CONVERSATION

220
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
WITH HIM.

221
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE HE WAS

222
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
TO NANCY AND HER SONS?

223
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
>> VERY CLOSE.

224
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
>> WHEN IS THE LAST TIME THEY

225
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
WERE BACK HERE --

226
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
>> I ACTUALLY SAW HER LAST

227
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
NOVEMBER WHEN JIM CHAMPION

228
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
RETIRED.
I SAW HER AT THE RETIREMENT

229
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
PARTY.
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE CHILDREN

230
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
FOR -- SINCE THEY LEFT HERE IN

231
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
1998.
>> YOU SAID --

232
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IT WAS 1998,

233
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING.

234
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
>> ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

235
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
>> OKAY, THANKS A LOT.

236
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
>> ALL RIGHT, SO LET ME JUST PUT

237
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
IN PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE HAVE JUST

238
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
HEARD, AND SANJAY GUPTA IS STILL

239
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
WITH US, AS WELL.

240
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
JAMES CHAMPION, SANJAY IS A

241
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
POLICE OFFICER IN KINGSTON, NEW

242
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
HAMPSHIRE.
HE WAS GOING TO BE MAKING A

243
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
STATEMENT RIGHT NOW.

244
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
HIS SISTER WAS KILLED YESTERDAY.

245
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
NANCY LANZA, THE MOTHER OF ADAM

246
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
LANZA, THE MAN WHO WENT IN, THE

247
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
TWENTY-YEAR-OLD, AND KILLED ALL

248
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
OF THESE PEOPLE HERE IN NEWTOWN

249
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
WHERE WE ARE.

250
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
HE IS TOO EMOTIONAL.

251
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
HIS SISTER IS DEAD.

252
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
HE IS THE UNCLE OF THIS YOUNG

253
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
MAN.
BUT OTHER POLICE OFFICERS AND

254
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY CAME OUT

255
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
AND SPOKE ON HIS BEHALF.

256
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
WANTING TO SAYHAT THEY WILL

257
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
OBVIOUSLY COOPERATE FULLY WITH

258
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
THIS INVESTIGATION.
YOU THINK OF THE ENORMITY,

259
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
THOUGH, HERE HE IS A POLICE

260
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
OFFICER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
HIS SISTER IS DEAD, HIS NEPHEW

261
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
IS DEAD, KILLS HIMSELF AFTER

262
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
KILLING ALL OF THESE YOUNG

263
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
PEOPLE, AND SIX ADULTS.

264
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I CAN ONLY MAN WHAT HE CAN BE

265
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
GOING THROUGH.

266
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
>> AND IT SEEMED LIKE HE WANTED

267
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
TO COME OUT AND TALK ABOUT IT.

268
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
CERTAINLY ALL THIS INFORMATION.
THAT WAS WHAT THE PRESS

269
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
CONFERENCE WAS ABOUT.

270
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
AND AT THE LAST MOMENT, HE WAS

271
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
TOO OVERCOME TO DO IT.

272
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
WHICH IS NOT SURPRISING, GIVEN

273
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
THE LOSS.
WE TALKED ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO

274
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
DIED IN THE SCHOOL, BUT THE

275
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
LANZA FAMILY, THE CHAMPION

276
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
FAMILY, WHICH IS LANZA'S BROTHER

277
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
IN THE CASE, THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY

278
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
TRYING TO COME TO TERMS WITH

279
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
THIS, AS WELL.

280
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
INCOMPRENHENSIBLE IS THE WAY

281
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
THEY DESCRIBED IT.

282
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
THERE WILL BE ANSWERS, BUT I'M

283
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
JUST NOT SURE, WE STILL HAVE NOT

284
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
HEARD FROM THEM, IT IS

285
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
INCOMPREHENSIBLE, THE BIG

286
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
QUESTION REMAINS, WE MAY NEVER

287
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
FULLY GET THE ANSWER WHY.

288
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
>> Reporter: BUT PEOPLE ARE

289
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
ASKING THAT QUESTION, WOLF.

290
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
YOU JUST HEARD THAT QUESTION

291
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
FROM THE STATEMENT -- ON BEHALF

292
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
OF THE LANZA FAMILY.

293
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
AND ALL DAY WE HAVE BEEN

294
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
GATHERING MORE AND MORE

295
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUSPECT

296
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
AND HIS FAMILY, ALI, YOU HAVE

297
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
BEEN DIGGING INTO THIS.
WE JUST HEARD FROM FAMILY

298
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
MEMBERS OF NANCY LANZA.

299
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING ABOUT

300
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
NANCY?

301
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
BECAUSE SHE IS ALSO A VICTIM IN

302
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
THIS CRIME?

303
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
>> Reporter: YES, SHE IS

304
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
ABSOLUTELY A VICTIM, WE'RE ABOUT

305
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
TWO AND A HALF MILES AWAY FROM

306
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
THE QUIET AREA WHERE NANCY LIVED

307
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
WITH HER SON.

308
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
BEYOND THE POLICE CAR, YOU CAN'T

309
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
SEE AROUND THE AREA.

310
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
THE LANZAS MOVED INTO THIS AREA

311
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
IN 1997 OR 8, THEY PURCHASED

312
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
HOUSE IN 1998.

313
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
THEY LIVED IN THE HOUSE TOGETHER

314
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
UNTIL NANCY AND HER HUSBAND,

315
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
PETER, SEPARATED SEVERAL YEARS

316
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
AGO AND DIVORCED IN 2009.

317
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
AND THAT LEFT RYAN, THE SON WHO

318
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
NOW LIVES IN HOBOKEN, NEW

319
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
JERSEY, AND IT LEFT NANCY AND

320
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
ADAM LIVING IN THE HOUSE.

321
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
NANCY WORKED IN FINANCE IN

322
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
BOSTON, AND HERE IN CONNECTICUT.

323
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
SHE RECENTLY STOPPED WORKING,

324
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
WHICH IS INTERESTING.

325
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS

326
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
RETIRING FROM WORKING OR

327
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
SPENDING TIME AT HOME.

328
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
BUT SHE DID SEEM TO CONFIDE WITH

329
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
FRIENDS THAT SHE WANTED TO TAKE

330
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
CARE OF ADAM.

331
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
SO THEY LIVED IN THIS HOUSE

332
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
UNTIL FRIDAY MORNING.

333
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
AND WE SPOKE TO RESIDENTS AROUND
HERE.

334
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
IT IS A VERY QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD.
ALL THE LIGHTS ARE FROM CAMERAS.

335
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
BIG HOUSES, WE SPOKE TO ONE

336
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
NEIGHBOR WHO SAID THEY SEEMED

337
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
QUITE NORMAL, LISTEN.

338
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
>> THEY WERE A QUIET, SEEMINGLY

339
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
FRIENDLY PEOPLE, I DON'T THINK

340
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
PEOPLE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

341
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
REALLY KNEW THEM TOO WELL.

342
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
>> Reporter: WE ALSO SPOKE --

343
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
THAT IS A YOUNG MAN WHOSE MOTHER

344
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
WE ALSO SPOKE TO SAID LOOK,

345
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
NANCY WAS INTO GARDENING.

346
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
SHE HAD -- YOU KNOW, THEY WERE

347
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
NOT ALL THAT SOCIAL WITH THEIR

348
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
NEIGHBORS, BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW

349
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
IF THEY HAD A SOCIAL CIRCLE

350
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
OUTSIDE OF HERE.

351
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
AND THAT IS THE STORY, NOT A LOT

352
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
OF INFORMATION.

353
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
THIS AREA, THEY ASKED RESIDENTS

354
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
TO LEAVE, SOME HAD COME BACK.

355
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
IT IS AN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE,

356
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
POLICE SAY THEY'RE FINDING A

357
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION FROM

358
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
THE SHOOTING SCENE AT THE HOUSE.

359
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
BUT A LOT OF NEIGHBORS ARE NOT

360
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
REALLY TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS

361
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
GOING ON.

362
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
THERE IS SOME CONFUSION.

363
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
THIS IS A STORY WHERE THERE ARE

364
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
A LOT OF CONFLICTING DETAILS ALL

365
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
OVER THE PLACE.

366
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
ONE AREA IS THE GUNS, WHERE THEY

367
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
CAME FROM, WHAT THEY WERE USED

368
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
FOR.
NANCY LANZA APPARENTLY TOLD A

369
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
DECORATOR, WHO HAD DONE THE

370
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS ON THEIR

371
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
HOUSE, THAT NANCY SAID SHE

372
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
APPARENTLY SHOWED HIM A GUN, A

373
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
RIFLE THAT SHE HAD RECENTLY

374
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
BOUGHT AND SAID SHE LIKED TO

375
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
TAKE HER KIDS FOR TARGET

376
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
SHOOTING.
THE ATF LOOKED AT RANGES IN THE

377
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
AREA, AND SAID THEY DON'T HAVE

378
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
EVIDENCE THAT THE FAMILY WENT TO

379
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
LOCAL SHOOTING RANGES TO SHOOT.

380
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
BUT THAT IS THE LATEST

381
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
INFORMATION.
>> Reporter: IT WAS SURPRISING

382
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
TO SOME, ALI, THAT THE

383
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
INFORMATION CAME OUT THAT THE

384
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
GUNS, WHILE THE NUMBER OF GUNS

385
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
AND HOW MANY GUNS WERE ON ADAM

386
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
LANZA AT THE TIME OF THE

387
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
SHOOTING AT THE SCHOOL, IT WAS

388
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
SURPRISING TO MANY THAT THE GUNS

389
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
WERE LEGALLY PURCHASED BY NANCY

390
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
LANZA.
>> Reporter: YOU DO HAVE TO DO

391
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
CERTAIN THINGS, INCLUDING TAKE A

392
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
COURSE WITH THE GUN LAWS.

393
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
OF THE SIX GUNS WE HEARD WERE IN

394
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
THE HOUSE, THREE OF THEM WERE

395
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
STANDARD RIFLES.

396
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
AND THE THREE HE TOOK WITH HIM

397
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
WERE SEMIAUTOMATICS, IN WHICH

398
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
CASE YOU CAN PULL WITH TRIGGER

399
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
PULLS.

400
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
THEY MAKE THE MOST SENSE OF

401
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS.

402
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
THEY'RE NOT CALLED ASSAULT

403
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
WEAPONS, THAT IS A DIFFERENT

404
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
CATEGORY OF GUNS.

405
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
BUT IT DOES SEEM HE HAD ACCESS

406
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
TO GUNS THAT WERE NOT REGISTERED

407
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
TO HIM.

408
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
THEY WERE REGISTERED TO NANCY,

409
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
THAT IS PARTLY BECAUSE

410
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
CONNECTICUT KEEPS SUCH GOOD GUN

411
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
LAWS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO FIND

412
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
THAT OUT QUICKLY.

413
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, GREAT

414
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
REPORTING, WOLF I'M GOING TO GO

415
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
BACK TO YOU.

416
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN.

417
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
AS YOU SAID SO MANY TIMES, THE

418
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
QUESTION WHY?

419
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT IS EVER

420
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
GOING TO BE ANSWERED.

421
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
>> YEAH, AT LEAST NOT COMPLETELY

422
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
TO BE SURE.

423
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
KATE, THANK YOU.
WE'RE BEGINNING ALSO TO PUT

424
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
NAMES AND FACES WITH SOME OF

425
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN

426
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
THIS TRULY UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY.

427
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
ALL SIX OF THE ADULTS WHO DIED

428
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
AT THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

429
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
SCHOOL WERE WOMEN.
HERE ARE SOME OF THEIR STORIES.

430
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
VICTORIA SOTO'S FAMILY SAID SHE

431
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
HAD HER STUDENTS HIDDEN BEHIND

432
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
HER TRYING TO PROTECT THEM WHEN

433
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
SHE WAS SHOT AND KILLED AT THE

434
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

435
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
HER COUSIN SAYS THE HARDEST PART

436
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
WAS WAITING TO HEAR WHETHER SHE

437
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
HAD SURVIVED OR NOT.

438
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
>> AND AT THAT POINT, IT WAS THE

439
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
HARDEST FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY,

440
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
JUST A WAITING GAME TO RECEIVE

441
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
WORD ON WHAT HAPPENED TO VICKY'S

442
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
CLASS.

443
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
>> ALSO KILLED, LAUREN RUSSO,

444
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
HIRED JUST LAST MONTH AS A

445
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
SUBSTITUTE TEACHER.

446
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
HER FAMILY SAYS SHE ALWAYS
WANTED TO BE A TEACHER SINCE

447
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
BEFORE SHE EVEN WENT TO

448
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
KINDERGARTEN.

449
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
SHE HAS TWO DAUGHTERS IN THEIR

450
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
TWENTIES, MARRIED 31 YEARS AND

451
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
GOES TO A LAKE HOUSE WITH HER

452
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
HUSBAND, IN UPSTATE, NEW YORK.

453
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
AND THE PRINCIPAL, SERIOUS ABOUT

454
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
TEACHING.

455
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
>> SHE IS AN EXCITING, JOYFUL,

456
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
JUST AN INCREDIBLE EDUCATOR, AND

457
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
THEN TO LOSE SOMEBODY LIKE THAT

458
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
IN OUR DISTRICT, IT IS SAD.

459
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
>> SHE WAS A PERSONAL FRIEND AND

460
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
WONDERFUL LEADER.

461
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
>> Reporter: SHE HAD RECENTLY

462
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
OVERSEEN THE INSTALLATION OF A

463

NEW SECURITY SYSTEM, REQUIRING

464
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
EVERY VISITOR AFTER 9:30 TO GET

465
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
BUZZED IN AND SHOW ID.

466
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
>> SHE TRULY DID BELIEVE IN

467
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

468
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
CHILDREN FELT SAFE.
I REALLY FEEL THAT IS THE TRAGIC

469
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
IRONY.
>> SHE WAS ALSO A PARENT

470
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
HERSELF, RAISING TWO DAUGHTERS

471
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
AND THREE STEPDAUGHTERS.

472
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
RESIDENTS SAY HOCHSPRUNG WAS

473
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
WELL LOVED.
>> GOD BLESS HER, SHE WAS JUST A

474
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
VERY SPECIAL PERSON.

475
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000

>> YOU KNOW, WOLF, IF THEY'RE

519
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
GOING TO FIGURE OUT THE WHY IN

520
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
THIS CASE, WHY IT HAPPENED,

521
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
INVESTIGATORS HOPE THEY CAN DO

522
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
IT BY RETRACING THE STEPS.

523
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
REALLY SPANNING THREE STATES.

524
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
THEY LOOKED AT THE BROTHER'S

525
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
APARTMENT HERE DOWN IN HOBOKEN,

526
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
NEW JERSEY, BY THE WAY, JUST

527
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
ACROSS FROM NEW YORK CITY.

528
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
AND UP HERE, THEY GO TO THE

529
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
MOTHER'S HOUSE, WHERE THEY FOUND

530
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
HER BODY.

531
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
AND THIS IS WHERE THEY BELIEVE

532
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
IT ALL STARTED WITH HER MURDER.

533
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
OF COURSE, THEIR BIG FOCUS IS ON

534
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
THE SCHOOL ITSELF.

535
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
LET'S MOVE OVER THERE AND TAKE A

536
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
LOOK.

537
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
BECAUSE AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THAT

538
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
AFTER KILLING HIS MOTHER,

539
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
WHETHER IMMEDIATELY, OR AFTER A

540
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
PERIOD OF TIME, WE DON'T KNOW,

541
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
THAT THE GUNMAN WENT OVER TO THE

542
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
SCHOOL AND THERE, HE HAD THESE

543
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
WEAPONS IN HIS CAR OR SOME

544
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
VERSION OF THESE WEAPONS.

545
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
AND HE BEGAN TO MOVE IN ON THE

546
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
SCHOOL ITSELF.

547
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
WE HAD A BETTER PICTURE, A CLOSE

548
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000

9:30 IN THE MORNING IS WHEN WE

552
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
BELIEVED HE WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY

553
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
APPROACHED THE SCHOOL ITSELF,

554
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
LEAVING, WE THINK, THIS CAR OVER

555
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
HERE.
THEY PUT A LOT OF FOCUS ON IT.

556
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
AND EVEN IF IT WERE THIS CAR, HE

557
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
WOULD HAVE COME THIS WAY, UP TO

558
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
THESE FRONT DOORS.

559
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
AND EARLIER IT WAS MENTIONED

560
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
THIS NEW SECURITY SYSTEM, THAT

561
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
PREVENTED THE FIRST BARRIER TO

562
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
HIM.
BECAUSE IT WAS LOCKED AT A TIME.

563
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
AND THERE WAS A REPORT LATE ON

564
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
FROM AUTHORITIES THAT SAID THE

565
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
GLASS HAD BEEN BROKEN, WHETHER

566
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
HE KICKED IT OUT, OR SHOT IT

567
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
OUT.
WHATEVER HAPPENED.

568
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
AND HE WENT IN THE SCHOOL, THIS

569
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE.
THE FIRST REPORT WE HAVE OF

570
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
ACTUAL GUNFIRE OCCURRING IN THE

571
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
SCHOOL IS WHAT WAS REPORTED AT

572
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
9:36 IN THE MORNING, THAT IS

573
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
WHEN YOU HEAR THE FIRST POLICE

574
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
REPORT SAYING WE HAVE GUNFIRE

575
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
OCCURRING IN THE SCHOOL.
WE KNOW FROM WHAT WITNESSES SAID

576
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
THAT EVERYBODY WITHIN THE SCHOOL

577
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
KNEW THE GUNFIRE HAD STARTED, IN

578
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
PART BECAUSE SOME COULD ACTUALLY

579
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
HEAR THE GUNFIRE.

580
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
OTHERS HEARD IT OVER A P.A.

581
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
SYSTEM IN THE OFFICE, AND THEN

582
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
OTHERS CALLED AND SAID IS THAT

583
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
GUNFIRE?
THE AUTHORITIES SAY ALL THE

584
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
SHOOTING OCCURRED IN A VERY

585
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
SMALL AREA UP HERE NEAR THE

586
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
FRONT.

587
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
TWO ROOMS.
IT DID NOT SPREAD THROUGH THE

588
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
ENTIRE SCHOOL, EVEN THOUGH THERE

589
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
WERE 600 STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL.

590
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
ANOTHER IMPORTANT TIME TO

591
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
CONSIDER HERE, 9:38.

592
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I MENTIONED 9:38, BECAUSE BY

593
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
THAT TIME, IN A TWO AND A HALF

594
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
MINUTE SPAN, THIS IS THE TIME

595
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
WHERE THE AUTHORITIES SAY

596
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
THEY'RE HEARING THAT ALL THE

597
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
SHOOTING IS OVER.

598
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
AN INCREDIBLY SHORT PERIOD OF

599
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
TIME.

600
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
NOW I WILL SAY THERE WAS A

601
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
REPORT OF SHOTS, IT IS NOT CLEAR

602
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
IF SOMEBODY TOLD THEM THERE WERE

603
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
SHOTS OR IF THERE WAS SIMPLY A

604
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
DELAYED REPORT OF THE SHOTS.

605
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
BUT THE BULK OF THE SHOTS SEEMED

606
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
TO HAVE OCCURRED IN THIS VERY

607
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
SHORT WINDOW OF TIME.

608
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
THEN YOU MOVE TO 9:40 IN THE

609
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
MORNING, WHERE YOU GET THE CALL,

610
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
AT 9:43, FOR THE FIRST EMERGENCY

611
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
MEDICAL SERVICES.

612
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
TWO AMBULANCES WERE CALLED

613
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
INITIALLY ON POLICE RADIO.

614
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
AND A SHORT WHILE LATER, JUST A

615
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
MINUTE OR TWO LATER, THEY SAID

616
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
NO, WE HAVE MORE VICTIMS.

617
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
THEN THERE WAS SORT OF AN

618
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
INDEFINITE CALL FOR AS MANY

619
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
AMBULANCES AND EMS PEOPLE AS

620
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
THEY COULD GET TO THE SCHOOL.

621
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY HAD A

622
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
HUGE, HUGE PROBLEM ON THEIR

623
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
HANDS, AND THIS IS THE AMAZING

624
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
PART OF IT, WE PIECED TOGETHER

625
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
YESTERDAY.

626
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
WE HAVE MORE DETAILS, 9:40, WE

627
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
JUST PUT PLUS, PLUS, PLUS HERE,

628
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE

629
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
LOOSE WITHIN THE TIME.

630
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
BUT WE CAN SAY BY SOME CERTAINTY

631
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
THAT BY 9:53, THE REPORTS WERE

632
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
THAT THIS WAS BASICALLY OVER

633
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
WITH.
THERE WAS AN AWFUL LOT MORE TO

634
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
DO.

635
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
BUT THE SIMPLE TRUTH, BY 9:53,

636
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
THE REPORT WAS THEY SAID THEY

637
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
HAD A SUSPECT DOWN.

638
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
OFFICERS SAID THEY HAD CLEARED

639
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
THE BUILDING.
IT IS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR TO US

640
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
AT THIS POINT, MEANING THEY

641
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
CLEARED THE BUILDING OF POSSIBLE

642
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
SHOOTERS OR THEY HAD CLEARED THE

643
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
BUILDING OF POSSIBLE STUDENTS.

644
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
THIS PICTURE, BY THE WAY, FROM

645
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
THE NEWTOWN BEE.

646
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
IT IS NOT CLEAR IF THEY CLEARED

647
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
EVERYBODY OUT OR JUST THE

648
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
SUSPECT -- THEY WERE SEARCHING

649
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING, AS

650
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
WELL.
BUT JUST AS WE REPORTED

651
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
YESTERDAY, WOLF, THE SIMPLE

652
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
TRUTH IS ALL THIS HAPPENED IN

653
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
ABOUT A 27-MINUTE TIME SPAN.

654
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
ALL OF IT HAPPENING IN A VERY
CLOSE AREA HERE.

655
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
WITH MUCH MORE INFORMATION AND
MUCH MORE DETAIL THAT IS WHERE

656
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
THEY'RE HOPING TO FIGURE OUT

657
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
SOME KIND OF WHY.

658
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
WHAT WAS THE THING THAT MADE

659
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
THIS PERSON COME TO THIS SCHOOL

660
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
AND DO THIS HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE

661
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
ATTACK.

662
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
WOLF?

663
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
>> THE INVESTIGATION OBVIOUSLY

664
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
CONTINUES.
SO MANY QUESTIONS HAVE TO BE

665
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
ANSWERED, TOM, THANK YOU VERY

666
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
MUCH.
LET'S BRING IN BRIAN TODD RIGHT

667
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
NOW.
HE HAS GOT A CLOSER LOOK AT THE

668
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
SHOOTER.
THE TWENTY-YEAR-OLD, ADAM LANZA,

669
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
YOU'RE GETTING NEW INFORMATION,

670
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
BRIAN, WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING?

671
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
>> Reporter: WELL, POLICE SAY

672
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
THEY HAVE PICKED UP EVIDENCE

673
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
ABOUT LANZA, AND HIS MOTHER,

674
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
PICKING UP EVIDENCE AT THE
HOUSE.

675
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
THEY'RE NOT LETTING ON WHAT THE
EVIDENCE IS.

676
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
BUT WE'RE GETTING NEW DETAILS
ABOUT THE SHOOTER'S PAST AND HIS

677
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
FAMILY.

678
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
HIS MOTIVE FOR THIS UNSPEAKABLE

679
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
ACT IS STILL NOT CLEAR, LAW

680
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SAY.

681
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
AND IN DIGGING FOR DETAILS ABOUT

682
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
SHOOTER ADAM LANZA AND HIS

683
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
FAMILY, THERE ARE CONFLICTING

684
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
REPORTS.
A NEIGHBOR WHO KNEW HIM IN

685
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
RECENT YEARS DESCRIBED HIM AS

686
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
TROUBLED.
BUT LISTEN TO THOSE WHO KNEW

687
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
HIM.
>> JUST A KID.

688
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
>> Reporter: NEVER ANTI-SOCIAL?

689
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
>> NO, NO.

690
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
>> Reporter: TROUBLE MAKER?

691
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
>> NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

692
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
>> Reporter: NOTICEABLE?

693
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
DID HE JUST KIND OF BLEND INTO

694
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
THE BACKGROUND?

695
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
>> YES, NOTHING THAT WOULD

696
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
WARRANT ANY OF THIS.

697
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
>> Reporter: RYAN CRAFT SAYS HE

698
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
BABYSAT LANZA ABOUT TEN YEARS

699
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
AGO WHEN HE WAS FIFTEEN, AND

700
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
LANZA WAS 10.

701
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
HE NEVER SAW ANYTHING THAT

702
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
WARRANTED VIOLENCE, BUT HE WOULD

703
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
OCCASIONALLY HAVE A TEMPER

704
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
TANTRUM.
>> HE WOULD BE WATCHING TV,

705
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
NORMAL STUFF THAT KIDS DO, BUT

706
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
AT TEN YEARS OLD, MOST KIDS GET

707
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
OUT OF THAT PHASE.

708
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
THAT WAS NOT THE CASE FOR ADAM.

709
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
>> Reporter: CRAFT WAS ONLY A

710
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
YEAR OVER ADAM'S OLDER BROTHER,

711
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
RYAN.

712
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
WHO SAID TO LET HIM DO WHAT HE

713
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
WANTED.
>> NANCY ALWAYS ASKED ME TO

714
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
ALWAYS BE WITH HIM IN THE ROOM,

715
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
NO MATTER WHAT.

716
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
LIKE DON'T GO TO THE BATHROOM.

717
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
DON'T EVER LEAVE HIM WITHOUT

718
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
SUPERVISION.

719
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
>> Reporter: CRAFT SAYS ADAM HAD

720
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
A CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH

721
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
HIS MOTHER, NANCY.

722
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
SHE HAD SPLIT WITH THE BOY'S

723
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
FATHER, PETER, WHO WAS DESCRIBED

724
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
AS TAX DIRECTOR AND VP AT GE

725
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
FINANCIAL SERVICES.

726
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
BUT CRAFT SAID THAT NANCY WAS AN

727
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
ENGAGED MOTHER, ALWAYS SETTING

728
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
UP PLAY DATES FOR HER TWO SONS

729
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
AND TAKING UP FAMILY ACTIVITIES.

730
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
NEIGHBORS SAY SHE ENJOYED

731
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
GARDENING AND HAD TAKEN TIME OUT

732
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
OF FINANCE.

733
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
>> JUST LIKE EVERYBODY, NORMAL,

734
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
YOU KNOW, DECORATE THE HOUSE,

735
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
THE HOUSE WAS ALWAYS PRISTINE.

736
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
AND THE HOUSE WAS LIKE ANY OTHER

737
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
HOUSE WIFE.

738
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
>> Reporter: BUT LIKE HER SON,

739
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
THERE ARE GAPS IN NANCY LANZA'S

740
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
STORY THAT STILL NEED TO BE

741
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
FILLED IN.

742
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
SHE OWNED THE WEAPONS THAT LANZA

743
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
USED, INCLUDING THE

744
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE, ACCORDING

745
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
TO A SOURCE.

746
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
AND IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY SHE

747
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
PURCHASED THOSE WEAPONS.

748
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
WOLF?
>> Reporter: BRIAN, ADAM LANZA

749
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
HAD ACCESS TO MORE WEAPONS THAN

750
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
THE ONES HE BROUGHT WITH HIM TO

751
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
THE SCHOOL.
>> >> THAT IS RIGHT, HE LIVED

752
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
WITH HIS MOTHER, AND LAW

753
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SAY HE HAD

754
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
MORE ACCESS TO WEAPONS THAN HE

755
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
TOOK TO THE SCHOOL.

756
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
AND PICKING UP ON THAT, THE

757
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
WEAPONS AT THE HOUSE I'M SURE

758
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
WE'LL LEARN ABOUT THAT IN THE

759
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
COMING DAYS.

760
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
>> WE JUST GOT A NEW PHOTO OF

761
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
ADAM LANZA.

762
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'LL SHOW IT TO THE VIEWERS,
THERE HE IS, AS A YOUNG BOY, HE

763
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
WAS ONLY TWENTY YEARS OLD WHEN

764
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
HE WENT TO THIS ELEMENTARY

765
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
SCHOOL HERE IN NEWTOWN,

766
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
CONNECTICUT, KILLED 26 PEOPLE,

767
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF.

768
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
EARLIER HE KILLED HIS MOTHER AT

769
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
THE FAMILY HOME HERE IN NEWTOWN.

770
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
THAT PICTURE JUST COMING IN.

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000

KATE.
SHE IS WORKING THIS STORY, AS

00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
WELL.
KATE, THE QUESTIONS CONTINUE.

788
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY, WOLF,

789
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
EACH ONE OF THE VICTIMS' STORIES

790
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
IS HEART-WRENCHING, AND IT

791
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
ABSOLUTELY BREAKS THEIR HEARTS.

792
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
WE SPOKE WITH THE COUSIN OF THE

793
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
FIRST GRADE TEACHER, VICKY SOTO,

794
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
WHO DIED TRYING TO PROTECT HER

795
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
CLASS, WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING,

796
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
JASON?

797
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
>> Reporter: WELL, IT IS JUST AN

798
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
INCREDIBLE STORY.
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF

799
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
INCREDIBLE STORIES, AS YOU KNOW,

800
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
KATE, WHEN YOU GO OVER AND TALK

801
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
TO SOME OF THE MEMBERS WHO KNEW

802
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
THE CHILDREN, AND FACULTY, AND

803
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
THE REASON WHY I'M STANDING IN

804
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
FRONT OF STRATFORD HIGH SCHOOL

805
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
IS THIS IS WHERE VICTORIA, VICKY

806
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
SOTO GRADUATED IN 2003.

807
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
SHE WAS DESCRIBED AS SOMEBODY

808
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
WHO JUST CARED ABOUT TEACHING,

809
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
REALLY WANTED TO BE A TEACHER

810
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
SINCE SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

811
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
THAT IS THE PICTURE YOU SEE WITH

812
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
HER FAMILY.

813
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
THEY DESCRIBED HER AS SOMEBODY

814
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
WHO LOVED HER STUDENTS.

815
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
IN FACT, THEY TELL ME SHE NEVER

816
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
EVEN REFERRED TO HER STUDENTS AS

817
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
STUDENTS.

818
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
SHE CALLED THEM HER KIDS.

819
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
THEY TALKED A LITTLE BIT MORE

820
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
ABOUT WHY THEY'RE GOING TO BE

821
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
HOLDING A VIGIL HERE TONIGHT.

822
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
AND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT

823
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
HAPPENED IN THE CLASSROOM.

824
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
>> THE FAMILY DIDN'T WANT VICKY

825
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
JUST TO BE ANOTHER VICTIM ON A

826
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
PIECE OF PAPER.

827
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
VICKY WAS AN OUTSTANDING

828
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
TEACHER.
WELL LIKED, WELL RESPECTED IN

829
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
HER SCHOOL COMMUNITY.

830
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
AND SHE WAS TAKEN TOO EARLY.

831
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
SHE INSTINCTIVELY WENT INTO

832
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
ACTION WHEN A MONSTER CAME INTO

833
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
HER CLASS AND TRIED TO PROTECT

834
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
THE KIDS SHE LOVED SO MUCH.

835
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
>> Reporter: AND CAN YOU TELL ME

836
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW SHE

837
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
TRIED TO DO THAT?

838
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
>> WHAT WE WERE TOLD, SHE

839
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
GATHERED HER CHILDREN INTO A

840
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
CLOSET AND PUT HERSELF IN HARM'S

841
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
WAY, IN BETWEEN THE GUNMAN AND

842
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
THE KIDS.

843
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
AND WE JUST WANT THE PUBLIC TO

844
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
KNOW THAT VICKY WAS A HERO.

845
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
REGARDLESS OF THE INTIMATE
DETAILS THAT TOOK PLACE IN THAT

846
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
CLASSROOM, VICKY WAS DOING WHAT

847
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
SHE KNEW WAS RIGHT IN HER HEART,

848
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
AND WHAT SHE WAS TRAINED TO DO,

849
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
TO PROTECT HER KIDS.

850
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
>> Reporter: AND SOME OF THOSE

851
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
WHO ARE GOING TO THE VIGIL HAVE

852
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
ALREADY STARTED TO GATHER HERE

853
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
TONIGHT.

854
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
EXPECTED TO ATTEND, KATE, ARE

855
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
THEY ARE TWO SISTERS WHO YOU SEE

856
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
IN THE PICTURE.

857
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
HER MOTHER IS EXPECTED TO BE

858
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
HERE TONIGHT.
HER FATHER, AS WELL.

859
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
HER COUSIN WHO YOU JUST HEARD

860
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
FROM THERE.
I'M TOLD THAT WHAT HER FAMILY

861
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
SAYS THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS

862
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
TELLING PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY

863
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
WHO ARE COMING OUT.

864
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
TRY TO FIND GREEN HATS, AND

865
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
GLOVES, ANYTHING THAT IS GREEN.

866
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
BECAUSE GREEN IS ONE OF HER

867
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
FAVORITE COLORS.
APPARENTLY THERE IS GOING TO BE

868
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
SINGING OUT HERE, THE CHOIR WILL

869
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
BE HERE.

870
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
IT IS VERY HARD TO COPE.

871
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
ONE STORY IN PARTICULAR RESON  E

872
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
RESONATED WITH ME, THEY TALKED

873
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
ABOUT ONE THING VICKY CARED

874
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
ABOUT DEEPLY.

875
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
HER BLACK LAB, ROXY, WHO IS

876
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
WALKING AROUND THE APARTMENT,

877
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
WAITING FOR HER TO COME HOME.

878
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
AND OF COURSE, THAT IS HOW HER

879
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
FAMILY IS FEELING, WAITING FOR

880
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
HER TO COME HOME.

881
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
ANOTHER REASON THEY'RE HOLDING

882
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
THIS VIGIL, IS BECAUSE THEY WANT

883
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
THE WORLD NOT TO SEE HER AS JUST

884
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
ANOTHER VICTIM.

885
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
THEY WANT THE WORLD TO SEE HER

886
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
AS A DEDICATED TEACHER, A LOVING

887
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
SISTER, AND A LOVING DAUGHTER,

888
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
KATE.
>> Reporter: JASON, I'M SURE

889
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
THAT VICKY SOTO'S FAMILY ALREADY

890
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
KNOWS THIS.
BUT I SAT DOWN WITH THE PARENT

891
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
OF ONE OF HER FIRST GRADE

892
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
STUDENTS, AND THEY COULD NOT SAY

893
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
ENOUGH WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT

894
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
HER AS A TEACHER, SAYING THAT

895
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
THEIR SON, WHO SHE PROTECTED,

896
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
WHO HE WAS ABLE TO GET OUT ALIVE

897
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
AND RUN TO SAFETY, SAID HE CARED

898
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
ABOUT HIS TEACHER VERY, VERY

899
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
MUCH.
SO I AM SURE THEY WOULD WANT TO

900
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
PASS ALONG THAT STATEMENT TO

901
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
VICKY SOTO'S FAMILY, THANK YOU,

902
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
VERY MUCH, JASON.

903
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
COPING WITH UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY,

904
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
NOT ONLY FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE

905
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
DEAD BUT ALSO THE VICTIMS.

906
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
>> THE PRINCIPAL, WHO GOD BLESS

907
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
HER, LOST HER LIFE, WAS JUST --

908
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
A VERY SPECIAL PERSON.

909
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
AND ALL THE PARENTS KNEW THAT.

910
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
THERE'S A HEALTH COMPANY THAT
CAN HELP YOU STAY THAT WAY.

911
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
WHAT'S HEALTHIER THAN THAT?

912
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
HOW THEY'LL LIVE TOMORROW.

913
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
FOR MORE THAN 116 YEARS,

914
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL HAS WORKED
FOR THEIR CLIENTS' FUTURES.

931
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
HOUSE TO GET OUR CHILDREN, WE

932
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
WERE UNAWARE OF THE REAL TRAGEDY

933
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
AT HAND.

934
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I DID NOT THINK CHILDREN WERE

935
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
INVOLVED.
I THOUGHT THIS WAS ISOLATED, A

936
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
COUPLE OF TEACHERS, MAYBE EVEN

937
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
JUST ONE.

938
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
SO WHEN WE GOT OUR CHILDREN AND

939
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I SAW MY SON'S TEACHER -- THEY

940
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
WERE LIKE GHOSTS.

941
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
BUT THEY'RE INCREDIBLY COMPOSED.

942
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
THEY HAD THEIR SHEETS WITH THEM,

943
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
CHECKING OFF, MAKING SURE EACH

944
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
CHILD WENT WITH THEIR PARENT.

945
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
THEY -- THEY DID EVERYTHING

946
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
POSSIBLE TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN

947
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000

EVERYTHING, AND I WISH I HAD

948
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000

ADVICE YOU GIVE PARENTS WHOSE

962
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
CHILDREN MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED

963
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
TRAUMA, HORRIFIC EVENT LIKE

964
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
THIS?

965
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
>> THE PARENTS ARE GOING THROUGH

966
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
JUST TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF

967
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
STRESS.
AND IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF

968
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
US TO GIVE THEM AS MUCH SUPPORT.

969
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
THEY HAVE A LOT OF DEMANDS ON

970
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
THEM RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF HOW

971
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000

972
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
HOW TO PROVIDE THOSE COMFORTS.

973
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
AND THERE IS GREAT PEOPLE IN

974
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
CONNECTICUT AND ALL AROUND THAT

975
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING THAT CAN

976
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
LEND SUPPORT TO THEM AT THIS

977
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
TIME.
AND DOCTOR, IT IS SANJAY GUPTA,

978
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COME UP

979
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
HERE QUITE A BIT, IS THE

980
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
CHILDREN WHO ARE IN THE SCHOOL,

981
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
YOU KNOW, HOW LONG WILL THE

982
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
SYMPTOMS AND THE CONCERNS ABOUT

983
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
PTSD LAST FOR THEM?

984
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
>> WE HAVE LEARNED FROM OTHER

985
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
TYPES OF EVENTS.

986
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I HAVE WORKED AT SANTANA HIGH

987
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
SCHOOL AND OTHER SCHOOL

988
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
SHOOTINGS, AND ALSO AFTER

989
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
NORWAY.

990
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
WE KNOW THAT FOR SOME PORTION OF

991
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
THE KIDS IT IS GOING TO BE A

992
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
LONG-TERM EVENT.

993
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
AND WE NEED FOR MAKE SURE THAT

994
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
WE HAVE RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS

995
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
IN PLACE IN THE SCHOOL AND IN

996
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
THE COMMUNITY FOR THE NEXT

997
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
SEVERAL MONTHS AND SEVERAL YEARS

998
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
TO SUPPORT THOSE WHO NEED IT.

999
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
NOT EVERYBODY WILL NEED THAT

1000
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
LEVEL OF SUPPORT.

1001
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
>> GO AHEAD.

1002
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
>> IS IT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT,

1003
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
DOCTOR, ARE CHILDREN -- ARE THEY

1004
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
MORE RESILIENT THAN ADULTS?

1005
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
ARE THEY LESS RESILIENT?

1006
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE IT?

1007
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF KIDS WHO

1008
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
ARE GOING TO ABSOLUTELY BE

1009
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
RESILIENT.
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO THINK NOT

1010
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
JUST FROM THE PTSD SIDE OF

1011
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
THINGS, THESE FAMILIES ARE

1012
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
MOURNING.
AND THEY'RE DEALING WITH GRIEF.

1013
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

1014
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE ADDRESS

1015
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
THOSE GRIEF ISSUES.

1016
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
AND THAT SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF

1017
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
THEIR EXPERIENCES THEY MAY NOT

1018
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
BE ABLE TO BE GRIEVING OR

1019
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
MOURNING RIGHT NOW.
THAT BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY SAW

1020
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
AND THEY EXPERIENCED, THE TRAUMA

1021
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
PIECE OF IT IS GETTING IN THE

1022
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
WAY.

1023
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR

1024
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
SERVICES ARE PROVIDING BOTH THE

1025
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
TRAUMA AND THE GRIEF SUPPORT.

1026
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
>> I KNOW THE CONVENTIONAL, THE

1027
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
INSTINCTIVE IMAGE, THE INSTINCT

1028
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
IS, DR. BRIMER, IS FOR PARENTS

1029
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
NOT TO BREAK DOWN, START SHOWING

1030
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
REALLY DEEP EMOTIONS IN FRONT OF

1031
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
THE KIDS, BECAUSE THE KIDS WILL

1032
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
START TO GET SCARED.

1033
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
IS THAT SMART, THOUGH?

1034
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
SHOULD THE PARENTS TRY TO AVOID

1035
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
THAT?
>> THERE IS NO WAY THAT PARENTS

1036
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
ARE GOING TO AVOID WHAT THEIR

1037
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
FEELINGS ARE.

1038
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
AND THEY ARE GOING TO EXPRESS

1039
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
JUST HOW AWFUL AND HOW TRAGIC

1040
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
THIS HAS BEEN.

1041
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
BUT IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT

1042
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
PARENTS GET SUPPORT FROM OTHER

1043
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
ADULTS IN THEIR LIVES.

1044
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
WHETHER IT IS CLERGY OR OTHER

1045
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
LOVED ONES THAT CAN SUPPORT THEM

1046
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
IN A MUCH MORE WAY THAT THEY

1047
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
CAN'T GET FROM THEIR CHILDREN.

1048
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
>> WHAT ABOUT AGE?

1049
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
AND MAYBE THERE IS NOT A GREAT

1050
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
ANSWER TO THIS, DOCTOR.

1051
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
BUT THESE CHILDREN ARE SO YOUNG.

1052
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I MEAN, IS THERE A WAY TO -- IS

1053
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
THERE A SPECIFIC THING THAT YOU

1054
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
SHOULD AVOID WHEN TALKING TO

1055
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
THEM, OR SPECIFIC THINGS THAT

1056
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE

1057
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
HEARING NOW IN THESE COUPLE OF

1058
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
DAYS?
>> I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT

1059
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
THAT WE'RE HONEST WITH THEM.

1060
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
AS YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER, WE

1061
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
HAVE TO TALK BASED ON THEIR AGE

1062
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
LEVEL AND SO WE HAVE TO BE VERY,

1063
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
VERY CONCRETE AND KEEP OUR

1064
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
ANSWERS SHORT.

1065
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

1066
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
SOMETIMES -- WE HAVE TO REVISIT

1067
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
THESE CONVERSATIONS.

1068
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO ANSWER

1069
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
THEIR QUESTIONS HONESTLY.

1070
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
AND PROVIDE THEM COMFORT.

1071
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF IT IS

1072
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
TERMS OF SAFETY, AND HOW DO WE

1073
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
HELP THEM.

1074
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
THINK ABOUT THOSE CONCERNS OF

1075
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
SAFETY.
AND YOUNGER KIDS BRING IT TO

1076
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
HOME.

1077
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
SO THEY'RE GOING TO ASK

1078
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
QUESTIONS, AM I SAFE AT HOME

1079
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
RIGHT NOW?

1080
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
ARE YOU SAFE?

1081
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
AND WE CAN PROVIDE THOSE TYPES

1082
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
OF REASSURANCES TO THEM.

1083
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
>> AND VERY QUICKLY, SHOULD THE

1084
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
KIDS GET BACK TO THEIR ROUTINES

1085
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
IN DEALING WITH THIS?

1086
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
IN OTHER WORDS, SHOULD THEY GO

1087
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
BACK TO SCHOOL ON MONDAY?

1088
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
>> I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO

1089
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
GET THOSE KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL.

1090
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
THEY MAY NOT BE DOING THOSE TYPE

1091
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
OF THINGS AT SCHOOL.

1092
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
THEY MAY NOT BE READY TO LEARN.

1093
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
BUT SCHOOL CAN BE THAT EXTRA

1094
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES

1095
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
RIGHT NOW.

1096
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
WE CAN HAVE EXTRA PROFESSIONALS

1097
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
THERE AT SCHOOLS, TEACHERS CAN

1098
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
MONITOR.

00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
HOW AS A CHRISTIAN I UNDERSTAND

1276
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
THAT THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH WE

1277
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
CAN TRANSFORM AND BE TRANSFORMED

1278
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
IN THE MIDST OF SUFFERING.

1279
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THAT'S

1280
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
NOT A QUESTION THAT I TRY TO

1281
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
ANSWERER TODAY BECAUSE PEOPLE

1282
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
DON'T NEED TO HEAR WHAT BECOMES

1283
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
AN OVERSIMPLISTIC ANSWER TO

1284
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
SOMETHING SO DEEP AND PROFOUND.

1285
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
>> WHAT WILL BE THE CENTRAL

1286
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
MESSAGE THAT YOU TELL YOUR

00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
THAT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF

1290
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
DARKNESS THERE IS LIGHT.

1291
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
IT'S TRAJ THANK WE ARE IN THE

1292
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000

AND ADVENT AND IT'S A HOLY TIME

1295
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
FOR US.

1296
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN THE

1297
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
MIDST OF A SEASON THAT SO OFTEN

1298
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
WE ASSOCIATE WITH JOY AND

1299
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
MERRIMENT, THAT IT'S ALSO A

1300
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
SEASON OF DARKNESS AND, IN FACT,

1301
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
THE GOSPEL OF JOHN TELLS US

1302
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
LIGHT SHINES IN THE DARKNESS AND

1303
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
THE DARKNESS DOES NOT OVERCOME

1304
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
IT.
I'LL BE PREACHING A MESSAGE THAT

1305
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
PROMISES IN THE MIDST OF THE

1306
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
DARK TIMES THAT WE KNOW THE

1307
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
LIGHT OF GOD IS WITH US AND THAT

1308
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
WE CAN BE SUSTAINED IN THAT AND

1309
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
WE CAN SEE THAT LIGHT IN EACH

1310
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
OTHER AND DRAW FROM THAT LIGHT

1311
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
THAT IS A PART OF OUR FAITH.

1312
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT

1313
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
WE CAN DO AS I REACTION TO THIS

1314
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
IS THRIVE.

1315
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I SET MY BANQUET IN THE PRESENCE

1316
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
OF THE ENEMIES.

1317
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
THE ENEMY IS THE HORRIBLE EVENT

1318
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
AND THE BANQUET IS CONTINUING

1319
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
OUR THRIVING IN LIFE.

1320
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I LIVED IN ISRAEL FOR TEN YEARS

1321
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
AND SAW THE WAY THE ISRAELIS

1322
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
WOULD PICK UP AND GO TO THE SPOT

1323
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
WHERE SOMETHING TERRIBLE

1324
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
HAPPENED AND THE MESSAGE WAS WE

1325
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000

1326
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
WE WILL CARRY ON.

1327
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
WE HAVE GREAT SCHOOLS IN

1328
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
NEWTOWN.

1329
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
THIS WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.

1330
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
THIS EVENT DOESN'T DEFINE US.

1331
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE GREAT

1332
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000

AND BE THE GATE COMMUNITY.

1333
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
MATTHEW AND I ARE GREAT FRIENDS

AND ALL OF THE CLERGY ARE GREAT

1335
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
FRIENDS, AND WE WILL RECOVER.

1336
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000

00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000

1338
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000

00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
FAINTING.

1349
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
OUR FOREIGN AFFAIRS REPORTER

1350
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000

SHE CAUGHT THAT ON A TRIP TO

00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
EUROPE.
SHE HAD TO CANCEL HER TRIP TO

REALIZED WHEN SHE FAINTED SHE

1367
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
SUFFERED A CONCUSSION.

1368
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
LET ME READ YOU A STATEMENT FROM

1369
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
HER SPOKESMAN, DEPUTY ASSISTANT

1370
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
SECRETARY.
WHILE SUFFERING FROM A STOMACH

1371
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
VIRUS SECRETARY CLINTON BECAME

1372
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
DEHYDRATED AND FAINTED

1373
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
SUSTAINING A CONCUSSION.

1374
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
SHE'S BEEN RECOVERING AT HOME

1375
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE

1376
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
MONITORED REGULARLY BY HER

DOCTORS.

1378
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FROM HOME

00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
WITH DEPARTMENT AND OTHER

1381
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
OFFICIALS.

1382
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
WOLF, I'M TOLD THIS CONCUSSION

1383
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
WAS NOT SEVERE AND THAT

1384
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
SECRETARY DOES INTEND TO COME

1385
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
BACK TO WORK AFTER SOME

1386
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
RECUPERATION AND HER DOCTOR SAID

1387
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
IN A STATEMENT SHE WILL MAKE A

1388
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
FULL RECOVERY.
>> I'M SURE SHE WILL MAKE A FULL

1389
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
RECOVERY.
WE'RE HOPING FOR THAT, OF

1390
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
COURSE.

1391
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
ELISE, THANKS VERY MUCH.

1392
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
LET'S BRING BACK CHIEF MEDICAL

1393
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
CORRESPONDENT, SANJAY GUPTA.

1394
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
THE STATEMENT FROM THE DOCTORS

1395
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
IS INTERESTING.

1396
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
IT GOES BEYOND WHAT THE OFFICIAL

1397
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
STATE DEPARTMENT STATEMENT SAID.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1398
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
PEOPLE HAVE MAYBE SEEN THIS BUT

1399
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
IT SAYS OVER THE COURSE OF THE

1400
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
WEEK THEY EVALUATED HER AND

1401
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
ULTIMATELY DETERMINED SHE

1402
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
SUSTAINED A CONCUSSION.

1403
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
WHAT THIS MEANS, OBVIOUSLY, THIS

1404
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
DIDN'T HAPPEN TODAY.

1405
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
THIS -- SHE HAD A FAINTING

1406
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
EPISODE, HIT HER HEAD, THAT

1407
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
HAPPENED EARLIER IN THE WEEK AND

1408
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
DOCTORS EXAMINING HER AND

1409
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
DETERMINING SHE HAD A CONCUSSION

1410
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
AFTER THAT.
THEY'RE ALSO SAYING NO STRENUOUS

1411
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
ACTIVITY.

1412
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
OFTENTIMES THEY ADD TO THAT,

1413
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
WHICH YOU MAY FIND INTERESTING,

1414
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
YOU DON'T WANT TO -- YOU ALMOST

1415
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
WANT TO GIVE THE BRAIN REST AS

1416
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
WELL.

1417
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
DOCTORS WILL LITERALLY SAY DON'T

1418
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
READ ANYTHING, DON'T WATCH

1419
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
TELEVISION, DON'T GET ON A

1420
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
COMPUTER.

1421
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
YOU WANT TO PUT THE BRAIN TO

1422
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
REST FOR A WHILE TO ALLOW THE

1423
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
BRAIN TO RECOVER FROM A

1424
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
CONCUSSION.
>> BECAUSE THE AT THE SAME TIME

1425
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT, HER

1426
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
SPOKESMAN, BASICALLY SAID SHE'S

1427
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
WORKING FROM HOME.
THE DOCTORS ARE SAYING THEY

1428
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
STRONGLY ADVISE HER TO CANCEL

1429
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
ALL WORK EVENTS FOR THE COMING

1430
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
WEEK.

1431
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS IS PROBABLY SOME OF THE

1432
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
FRICTION SOMETIMES WEAN DOCTORS

1433
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
AND WHAT PATIENTS WANT TO DO.

1434
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I IMAGINE IT'S GOING TO BE HARD

1435
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
TO GET HER NOT TO DO ANYTHING AT

1436
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
ALL.
THE BEST WAY TO GET FULL

1437
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
RECOVERY FROM A CONCUSSION IS

1438
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
NOT DO ANYTHING.
THIS IS MORE THAN ANECDOTAL.

1439
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
THOSE IS SOMETHING WE KNOW --

1440
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I'VE DONE A LOT OF REPORTING, AS

1441
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
YOU KNOW, ON CONCUSSIONS -- THIS

1442
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

1443
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
OBVIOUSLY SHE'S SECRETARY OF

1444
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
STATE BUT THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT

1445
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
FOR HER TO RECOVER AS WELL SHE'S

1446
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
CAN.
>> SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO APPEAR

1447
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
BEFORE THE HOUSE AND SENATE THIS

1448
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
WEEK ON DECEMBER 20th ON THE

1449
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
BENGHAZI KILLING OF THE FOUR

1450
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
AMERICANS INCLUDING THE U.S.

1451
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
AMBASSADOR, STATE DEPARTMENT

00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
REPORT ABOUT TO RELEASED ON WHAT

1453
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
EXACT HI HAPPENED.

1454
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
SHE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T DO THAT.

1455
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
THEY'VE ANNOUNCED SHE CAN'T

1456
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
APPEAR P

1457
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
APPEAR.

1458
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
SHE'S SENDING TWO DEPUTIES.

1459
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
>> THAT'S THE BRAIN REST.

1460
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
RECOVERING FROM A CONCUSSION

1461
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
WOULD NOT -- THAT WOULD NOT BE

1462
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
ON THE AGENDA.
>> ASSUME IT'S A MILE

1463
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
CONCUSSION.

1464
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
SHE'S AT HOME, NOT IN THE

1465
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
HOSPITAL.
THEY DETERMINED SHE HAD A

1466
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
CONCUSSION.

1467
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
BRAIN REST IS VERY IMPORTANT.

1468
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
BUT HOW LONG?

1469
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
HOW LONG SHOULD SOMEBODY AVOID

1470
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
ANY MENTAL REAL STRENUOUS

1471
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
ACTIVITY?
>> WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TRIAL

1472
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
SOMEBODY.
SO YOU MIGHT -- MY GUESS IS WHAT

1473
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
HAS HAPPENED SHE CONTINUED TO

1474
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
HAVE SYMPTOMS AFTER THIS, MAYBE

1475
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
HEADACHE, MAYBE BLURRINESS OF

1476
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
VISION, IT DID NOT CLEAR AS

1477
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
QUICKLY AS THEY WOULD HAVE

1478
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
LIKED.

1479
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
THEY DETERMINED IT WAS A

1480
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
CONCUSSION.
YOU SLOWLY REINTRODUCE ACTIVITY,

1481
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
ALLOW SOMEONE TO START READING,

1482
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
ENGAGING IN EXERCISE, AND SEEING

1483
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
IF ANY OF THE SYMPTOMS COME

1484
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
BACK.

1485
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
IF THEY COME BACK, YOU'RE BACK

1486
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
ON REST AGAIN.

1487
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
SO IT CAN BE BACK AND FORTH FOR

1488
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
A LITTLE BIT.

1489
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
MY GUESS IS A WEEK.

1490
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
THAT'S TYPICALLY WITH A MILD

1491
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
CONCUSSION, HOW THEY'RE

1492
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
CHARACTERIZING IT, THAT'S THE

1493
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
TYPICAL TIME FRAME.

1494
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
AGAIN, BEING THEY LET HER BE

1495
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
HOME, THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE

1496
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
TIME, I THINK THEY OBVIOUSLY

1497
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
WOULD HAVE A LOW THRESHOLD FOR

1498
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
HAVING HER IN THE HOSPITAL IN

1499
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
THIS CASE, SHE'S NOT.

1500
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
SO I THINK THE
