00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
BECAUSE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS,

187
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
AND PARTICULARLY IN 2013, WE

188
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
HAVE TO REACH A STAGE WHERE 100%

189
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
OF THE OPERATIONS ARE IN THE

190
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
HANDS OF THE AFGHAN ARMY.

191
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT MORE

192
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
WORK.

193
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
>> SO IS THAT WHY THERE'S BEEN A
BIT OF A DELAY?

194
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I WAS JUST LOOKING AT SOME OF

195
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
THE HEADLINES.

196
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
YOU SAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A

197
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
TROOP COUNT DECISION IN A FEW

198
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
WEEKS.

199
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
AND THEN THE LAST HEADLINE I SAW

200
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
WAS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND

201
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
YOU SAID, I'M GOING TO HAVE A

202
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
TROOP COUNT IN A FEW WEEKS.

203
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
WHAT'S CAUSING THAT DELAY?

204
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
ARE YOU NOT SURE OF THE RIGHT

205
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
NUMBER?

206
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
IS THE PRESIDENT HOLDING IT UP?

207
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
WHERE IS THE DELAY?

208
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
>> NO, I THINK -- I THINK, FIRST

209
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
AND FOREMOST, THAT GENERAL

210
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
ALLEN, HAVING DEVELOPED THE

211
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
CAMPAIGN PLAN FOR AFGHANISTAN,

212
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
IS THE ONE WHO REALLY HAS TO

213
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
COME FORWARD WITH THE

214
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
RECOMMENDATIONS AS THE TO WHAT

215
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
THE ENDURING PRESENCE WILL LOOK

216
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
LIKE.
AND HE'S PREPARED SEVERAL

217
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
OPTIONS.
WE'VE REVIEWED THEM AND THEN

218
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
ULTIMATELY THEY HAVE TO BE

219
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
PRESENTED TO THE NATIONAL

220
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
SECURITY CONSUL, WHICH REVIEWS

221
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
THEM AND THEN PRESENT IT TO THE

222
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
PRESIDENT FOR A FINAL DECISION.

223
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
THAT JUST TAKES TIME, AND WE

224
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
WANT TO MAKE SURE, OBVIOUSLY,

225
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
THAT WE MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION

226
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
WITH REGARDS TO THE SIZE OF THAT

227
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
ENDURING PRESENCE.

228
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY

229
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
WORRIED THAT THE U.S. WILL HAVE

230
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
TOO FEW PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY

231
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
PROVIDE THE SECURITY THAT'S

232
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
REQUIRED.
AND SOME HAVE SAID THAT NUMBER

233
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
IS 20,000, AND FEWER THAN THAT

234
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
IS NOT ENOUGH.

235
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
IS THAT FAIR?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT DEPENDS ON

236
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
THE MISSIONS THAT WE'VE GOT TO

237
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
BE ABLE TO WORK ON, IN THAT

238
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
ENDURING PRESENCE.

239
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
AND THE KEY MISSIONS ARE THE

240
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
FOLLOWING.

241
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
ONE IS COUNTERTERRORISM, WHICH

242
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
MEAN

243
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
MEANS WE'LL CONTINUE TO CONFRONT

244
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
AL QAEDA.

245
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
AND THOSE THAT, YOU KNOW, HAVE

246
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
ALWAYS CONTINUED TO PLAN ATTACKS

247
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
ON THE UNITED STATES, WE JUST

248
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS

249
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
NO AL QAEDA THREAT HERE IN

250
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
AFGHANISTAN.

251
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
SECONDLY, TO DO THE TRAINING AND

252
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
ASSISTANCE THAT IS NECESSARY FOR

253
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
THE AFGHAN ARMY, AND THEN

254
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
THIRDLY, TO PROVIDE SOME OF THE

255
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
ENABLING CAPABILITIES FOR THE

256
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
FORCES THAT ARE HERE.

257
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
THAT WILL DETERMINE THE NATURE

258
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
OF THE PRESENCE, BUT THE BOTTOM

259
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
LINE IS THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO

260
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
ACCOMPLISH OUR MISSION, OUR MAIN

261
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
RESPONSIBILITY FOR SECURING THIS

262
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
COUNTRY HAS TO REST AT AFGHAN

263
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
ARMY.

264
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
>> SO YOU'RE NOT YET SURE ON THE

265
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
NUMBER.

266
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE JUST

267
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
WAITING TO ANNOUNCE IT.

268
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
YOU'RE NOT SURE ON THE NUMBER?

269
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
>> NO, WE'RE WORKING INTENTLY

270
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO DETERMINE

271
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
WHAT THAT IS GOING TO BE.
>> AND THE ORIGINAL MISSION HERE

272
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
WAS, I'LL QUOTE THE PRESIDENT,

273
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
RIGHT, TO DEFEAT, DISRUPT, AND

274
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
DESTROY AL QAEDA.
>> RIGHT.

275
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
>> IS THAT MISSION ACCOMPLISHED?

276
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
>> THE MISSION OF DEFEATING AND

277
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
DETERRING AL QAEDA, I THINK, IS

278
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
WELL ON THE WAY TOWARDS, YOU

279
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
KNOW, ACHIEVING THE MISSION,

280
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
WITH REGARDS TO AFGHANISTAN AND
THE THREAT THAT WE FACE HERE.

281
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
WE CONTINUE TO FACE AL QAEDA,

282
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
OBVIOUSLY, ELSEWHERE, NOT ONLY

283
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
IN PAKISTAN, BUT IN YEMEN AND

284
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
SOMALIA AND ELSEWHERE.

285
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE HAD

286
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
REMARKABLE SUCCESS GOING AFTER

287
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
SPECIAL OPERATIONS AGAINST AL

288
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
QAEDA HERE AND WE'RE CONTINUING

289
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
TO DO THAT.

290
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I THINK, YOU KNOW, THE MAIN

291
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
CHALLENGE HERE IS, OBVIOUSLY, TO

292
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
MAKE SURE THERE'S NO SAFE HAVEN

293
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
FOR AL QAEDA, IN WHICH TO

294
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
CONDUCT ATTACKS.

295
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
BUT THE KEY TO THAT IS IN

296
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
AFGHANISTAN, THAT CAN SECURE AND

297
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
GOVERN ITSELF.

298
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
THOSE TWO ARE INTERLOCKED IN

299
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
TERMS OF THE MISSION THAT WE

300
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
HAVE IN AFGHANISTAN.

301
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
>> BUT WHAT IF THEY CHOOSE THE

302
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
TALIBAN?
>> YOU KNOW, I'M VERY CONFIDENT

303
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
THAT THE AFGHAN PEOPLE WANT TO

304
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
BE SOVEREIGN, THEY WANT TO BE

305
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
INDEPENDENT, THEY WANT TO BE

306
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
FREE FROM THE TALIBAN, BUT THEY

307
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
WANT TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE

308
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
THEIR FUTURE.

309
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
AND THAT'S OKAY.

310
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

311
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
HERE.
IS TO HAVE AN AFGHANISTAN THAT

312
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
CAN DETERMINE ITS FUTURE.

313
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
>> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DEFEATING

314
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
AL QAEDA, YOU KNOW, YOU THINK

315
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
ABOUT SOME OF THE STATISTICS

316
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
HERE.

317
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S STILL AN

318
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
INSURGENCY.
93 POLICEMEN IN ONE DAY JOINED

319
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
THE TALIBAN.

320
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
DO YOU THINK AL QAEDA WILL EVER

321
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
BE DEFEATED, EVEN HERE?

322
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
>> I THINK YOU CAN REACH A POINT

323
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
WHERE YOU SO SIGNIFICANTLY

324
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
WEAKEN AL QAEDA THAT ALTHOUGH

325
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
THERE MAY STILL BE A FEW PEOPLE

326
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
AROUND, THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO

327
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
CONDUCT THE OPERATIONS THAT

328
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
THEY'VE CONDUCTED IN THE PAST,

329
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
AND THEY CERTAINLY WON'T BE ABLE

330
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
TO PLAN THE KIND OF ATTACKS THAT

331
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
AMERICAN HAD HAPPEN TO IT ON

332
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
9/11.
AND THAT'S OUR GOAL, IS TO MAKE

333
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

334
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
>> AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AL

335
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
QAEDA AND WHERE IT IS, MALI IS

336
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
WIDELY NOW SEEN AS A SAFE HAVEN

337
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
FOR AL QAEDA, AND IS LINKED TO,

338
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
INSPIRED BY, WHATEVER THE WORDS

339
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
MIGHT BE, DOES THE UNITED STATES

340
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
HAVE TO INTERVENE IN MALI?

341
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
>> WE'VE GOT TO GO AFTER AL

342
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
QAEDA, WHEREVER THE HELL THEY'RE

343
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
AT, AND MAKE SURE THEY FIND NO

344
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
PLACE TO HIDE.

345
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
BECAUSE LET'S NOT FORGET, THE

346
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
MAIN GOAL OF AL QAEDA IS TO

347
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
ATTACK THE UNITED STATES AND

348
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THAT TO

349
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
HAPPEN AGAIN.

350
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
AND IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW

351
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
IT TO HAPPEN, WE'VE GOT TO GO

352
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
AFTER THEM.

353
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
IN YEMEN, IN SOMALIA AND YES, IN

354
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
MALI IF NECESSARY.

355
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
>> AND FINAL QUESTION ON AL

356
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
QAEDA, HOW BIG OF A THREAT RIGHT

357
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
NOW, AS YOU ASSESS THREAT TO THE

358
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
HOMELAND, IS AL QAEDA?

359
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
>> I THINK WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY

360
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
WEAKENED THEIR ABILITY TO DO THE

361
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
KIND OF COMMAND AND CONTROL AND

362
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
PLANNING THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY

363
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
TO CONDUCT ANOTHER 9/11 ATTACK.

364
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
AT THE SAME TIME, THEY STILL

365
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
CONTINUE TO THREATEN OUR

366
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
COUNTRY.

367
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
AND THEY STILL REPRESENT, I

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
WE'RE ABSOLUTELY READY AND I

727
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
THINK THIS IS, IN THE INTEREST

728
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
OF PEACE IN AFGHANISTAN, AND

729
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
ABSOLUTELY DESIRABLE.

730
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
NONETHELESS, THERE HAVE TO BE

731
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
SOME OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS THAT

733
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
WE'VE HAD IN THE LAST TEN YEARS

734
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
CAN'T BE NEGOTIATED.

735
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
WE HAVE A CONSTITUTION THAT

736
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
GIVES RIGHTS TO MEN AND WOMEN IN

737

738
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A DEMOCRATIC

739
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
PERSON THAT'S VERY YOUNG, STILL,

740
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
A LONG WAY TO GO, BUT IT'S STILL

741
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
ONE OF OUR BIGGEST ACHIEVEMENTS.

742
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
>> AND I THINK ABOUT THE BOMB

743
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
THAT HAPPENED TODAY IN KANDAHAR.

744
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I WAS THINKING ABOUT SOME

745
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
ARTICLE THAT I READ IN THE GULF,

746
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I TRAVELED THERE THIS WEEK.

747
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
A PRUDENTIAL POLICE CHIEF WAS

748
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
KILLED AND THERE WAS ANOTHER

749
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
ATTACK, OBVIOUSLY, LAST WEEK.

750
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
THE TALIBAN IS PURPOSELY, AND

751
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
THEY SAY, SPECIFICALLY TARGETING

752
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

753
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
DO YOU FEEL THAT RISK EVERY DAY?

754
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
>> AS AN AFGHAN, YES.

755
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
AFGHANISTAN IS ON THE THREAT.

756
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
AFGHANISTAN FACES TERRORISM, AS

757
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
A THREAT, ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS.

758
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
SO I THINK THERE IS NO

759
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MYSELF AND

760
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000

IT'S A HARD AND STRESSFUL

910
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
SITUATION.
THERE IS SO MUCH SACRIFICE.

911
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
BUT AS WE LEARNED FROM THE BURNT

912
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
FAMILY, IT IS SOMETHING THAT

913
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
FAMILIES AT HOME LEARN TO DEAL

914
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000

MY DAD IS THAT HE'D ALWAYS MAKE

US LAUGH AND HE'D ALWAYS FIND

954
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
SOMETHING FUN FOR US TO DO IF WE

955
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000

LIVING HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD

958
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
FROM YOUR SPOUSE CAN BE REALLY

959
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
HARD.

960
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
>> I HAVE CAUGHT MYSELF HAVING

961
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
MOMENTS, WHERE I SAY, GOD, I

962
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
REALLY WISH HE WAS HERE RIGHT

963
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
NOW.
I MEAN, THOSE ARE NATURAL TO

964
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
HAVE.
BUT YOU CAN'T DWELL ON IT.

965
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE.

966
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
>> Reporter: THE BERENDTED HAVE

967
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
LEARNED TO BRIDGE THE GAP, USING

968
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
FACE TIME AND E-MAIL.

969
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
BUT MOSTLY, THEY TAKE A LOT OF

970
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
PICTURES, FOCUS ON THEIR

971
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
MEMORIES, AND ANXIOUSLY AWAIT

972
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
JOSH'S NEXT HOMECOMING.

973

>> EVERY DAY WE EAT ONE M&M, AND

974
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
THAT REPRESENTS ONE MORE DAY OF

975
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
HIM BEING CLOSER TO COMING HOME.

976

SPECIAL MOMENT FOR HIM EVERY

979
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000

TWO MONTHS, HE WON'T BE HOME FOR

981
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
CHRISTMAS.
I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH HIM

982
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
AT THE BASE IN KANDAHAR, WHERE

983
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
HE TOLD ME ABOUT HIS THOUGHTS ON

984
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
HIS JOB AND THE FUTURE FOR

985
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000

IT'S A VEHICLE THAT WE USE, IT

989
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
CARRIES ROUGHLY FIVE PERSONNEL.

990
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
YOU HAVE THE DRIVER, THE TANK

991
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
COMMANDER, WHICH IS A PASSENGER,

992
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
AND THE TWO DISMOUNTS IN THE

993
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
BACK AND THE FIFTH PERSON WILL

994
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
BE, OF COURSE, THE GUNNER, WHO

995
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000

996
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000

1000
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
IN CHARGE OF CONTROLLING THIS

1001
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
VEHICLE, WHERE WE'RE GOING, WHAT

1002
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
THE GUNNER DOES, IF I NEED TO

1003
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
REACT TO CERTAIN THING THINGS, M

SAY.

1007
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
>> SO DO YOU EVER -- I GUESS

1008

I -- DO YOU EVER GET SCARED?

1009
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
>> I GUESS IT'S ONLY HUMAN

1010
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
NATURE TO GET SCARED, IN SOME

1011
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM.

1012
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
BUT YOU DO IT SO MANY TIMES, YOU

1013
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
GET USED TO IT IN, IN A WAY.

1014

KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO

1017
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
BEFORE WE DO IT.

1018
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
AND IT IS SECOND NATURE FOR US

1019
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
AND IT'S PRETTY EASY AT TIMES.

1020
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I DO, I EXCEL AT, AND I TRY TO

1041
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
MAKE THE BEST OUT OF IT, AND
THIS IS DEFINITELY WHAT I'VE

1042
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
DONE MY WHOLE CAREER.

1043
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
>> YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE AT

WHAT HAVE WE GOTTEN OUT OF THIS?

1051
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
>> WE'VE GOTTEN QUITE A BIT.

1052
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I MEAN, HONESTLY, THE AFGHAN

1053
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
PEOPLE, EVEN FROM WHAT I WAS

1054
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
DEPLOYED IN IRAQ IN '03, DURING

1055
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
THE INVASION, YOU COULD SEE THE

1056
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
IRAQ PEOPLE AND THE AFGHAN

1057
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
PEOPLE STARTING TO DO STUFF ON

1058
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
THEIR OWN.

1059
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
HAVING MORE FREEDOM AND STUFF

1060
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
LIKE THAT.

1061
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
AND THAT IS A BIG THING THAT I

1062
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
TAKE OUT OF THIS.

1063
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
IS THEM BEING ABLE TO DO STUFF

1064
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
ON THEIR OWN, WITHOUT HAVING

1065
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
SOMEONE, YOU KNOW, TELLING THEM

1066
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO

1067
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES.

1068
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
AND I THINK THAT'S FREEDOM AND

1069
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
STUFF LIKE THAT IS A BIG

1070
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR ME, BEING

00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
HAVE MADE THROUGHOUT THE YEARS.

1074
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
>> AND DO YOU THINK, FROM WHERE

1075
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
YOU SIT, THAT AFGHANISTAN IS

1076
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
GOING TO BE READY, FOR PEOPLE

1077
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
LIKE YOU TO GO HOME?

1078
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
>> YES, I DEFINITELY DO.

1079
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'M GOING ON PATROL WITH THE

1080
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
PARTNERS.

1081
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
>> YOU GO OUT WITH THEM, BECAUSE

1082
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
YOU'RE TRAINING THEM --?

1083
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
>> EXACTLY.
AND THEY DO THINGS ON THEIR OWN

1084
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
THAT YEARS AGO THEY WERE NOT

1085
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
DOING ON THEIR OWN.

1086
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
THE LOGISTICS PART OF IT AND ALL

1087
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
THAT STUFF.
THEY ARE SUSTAINABLE BY

1088
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
THEMSELVES.
>> WE HEAR A LOT, THOUGH, ABOUT

1089
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
AFGHANS WHO WORK WITH AMERICANS

1090
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
AND THEN THEY WILL BLOW

1091
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
THEMSELVES UP AND KILL

1092
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
AMERICANS.
DO YOU HAVE A FEAR THAT THAT

1093
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
COULD HAPPEN?

1094
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
>> IT WOULD BE ALMOST UNHUMAN TO

1095
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
THINK THAT IN THE BACK OF YOUR

1096
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
MIND, YOU DON'T WANT TO GET WHAT

1097
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
WE CALL COMPLACENT, BUT WE'VE

1098
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
BUILT SUCH A TRUST WITH THESE

1099
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
GUYS THAT THE IN AND OUT DAYS OF

1100
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
WORKING WITH THEM, THAT STUFF

1101
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
JUST GOES TO THE WAYSIDE,

1102
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TREAT THEM

1103
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
AS ONE OF YOUR BROTHERS, WORKING

1104
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
WITH THEM, AND ONE OF YOUR OWN

1105
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
SOLDIERS, ALSO.

1106
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
>> AND YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THAT?

1107
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
>> TOTALLY FINE, YES.

1108
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
>> SERGEANT, WHAT MAKES YOU THE

1109
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
MOST PROUD ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE
DONE HERE?

1110
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
>> I THINK THE MOST PROUD IS

1111
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
JUST SEEING THE KIDS, AND THAT

1112
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
GENERATION THAT ARE GOING TO

1113
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE HERE IN

1114
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
AFGHANISTAN.
THE ELDERS AND STUFF ARE STILL

1115
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
IN THAT MIND-SET, BUT THE

1116
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
YOUNGER GENERATIONS, WHAT --

1117
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK
FORWARD TO AS THE YEARS PROGRESS

1118
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
IN THIS COUNTRY, IN AFGHANISTAN,

1119
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
IS THAT THE SUCCESSES THEY CAN

1120
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
MAKE, THEY CAN GO OUT AND BE

1121
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
SOMEONE, RATHER THAN BEING

1122
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
SECLUDED IN A COUNTRY LIKE THIS,

1123
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
THEY CAN MAKE LIVES FOR

1124
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
THEMSELVES, OUTSIDE OF HERE.

1125
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
>> AND WOULD YOU GO TO ANOTHER

1126
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
WAR, IF THERE WAS ANOTHER WAR?

1127
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
THE WAR ON TERROR CONTINUES.

1128
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
GOES SOMEWHERE ELSE, WOULD YOU

1129
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
STILL GO?

1130
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
>> WITHOUT A DOUBT, YES.

1131
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
THIS IS WHAT I SIGNED UP TO DO

1132
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
FOR MY COUNTRY.

1133
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
THERE ARE TWO REASONS WHY I

1134
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
JOINED THE MILITARY, FOR MY

1135
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
COUNTRY AND FOR MY FAMILY, TO

1136
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
SUPPORT MY FAMILY, AND THOSE ARE

1137
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
TWO THINGS I LOVE THE MOST, SO I

1138
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
WOULD DEFINITELY.
>> THE TWO THINGS THAT HE LOVES

1139
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
THE MOST.

1140
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
AND WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT HIS

1141
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
FAMILY, HE WAS EMOTIONAL.

1142
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
THEY ACTUALLY HAD PREPARED A

1143
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
SPECIAL MESSAGE FOR HIM, THAT WE

1144
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
WERE ABLE TO PLAY FOR SERGEANT

1145
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
BERNDT.

1146
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
AND WE WANTED TO SHOW YOU WHAT
HAPPENED.

1147
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
>> HI, HONEY.

1148
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
WE LOVE YOU AND MISS YOU.

1149
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
WE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU.

1150
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
WE HOPE THAT YOU HAVE A MERRY

1151
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
CHRISTMAS AND THAT YOU COME HOME

1152
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
SOON.
>> HI, DADDY.

1153
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I LOVE AND MISS YOU AND HAVE A

1154
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
>> MERRY CHRISTMAS!

1155
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
LOVE YOU.

1156
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
BYE!

1157
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
>> GOOD.
>> THEY MISS YOU.

1158
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
>> I MISS THEM TOO.

1159
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
>> AND YOU KNOW, YOUR WIFE WAS

1160
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
REALLY STRONG.

1161
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
>> YEAH.

1162
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
>> SHE --

1163
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
>> WHAT'S THE HARDEST PART ABOUT

1164
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
NOT BEING WITH HER?

1165
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
>> I MEAN, JUST BEING THERE

1166
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
EVERY DAY, SEEING, YOU KNOW,

1167
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
THEIR DAILY ROUTINE AND WHAT

1168
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
THEY DO AND, YOU KNOW, JUST

1169
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
GOING THROUGH, KIDS COMING HOME

1170
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
FROM SCHOOL, DOING HOMEWORK, YOU

1171
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
KNOW, MY SON PLAYING SPORTS AND

1172
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
STUFF LIKE THAT, AND THINGS MY

1173
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
DAUGHTER DOES, AND SHE'S JUST

1174
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
SO, YOU KNOW, OUTGOING AND DOES

1175
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
THINGS ON HER OWN NOW THAT I

1176
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
DON'T SEE.

1177
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
THE BIRTHDAYS, OF COURSE, AND

1178
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
EVEN THE SMALL THINGS LIKE

1179
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
MOTHER'S DAY AND FATHER'S DAY.

1180
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
JUST THINGS BEING AWAY FROM THE

1181
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
FAMILY.
BUT WE TRY TO DO THE BEST, YOU

1182
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
KNOW.
BUT WHILE I'M DEPLOYED, YOU

1183
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
KNOW, SHE KEEPS ME SO IN THE

1184
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
LOOP AND WE TRY TO DO THINGS

1185
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
TOGETHER STILL AS A FAMILY,

1186
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
BEING THERE FOR THE KIDS,

1187
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
SINGING HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THEM

1188
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
AND THAT STUFF WHILE THEY'RE

1189
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
OPENING THEIR PRESENTS AND

1190
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
STUFF, EVEN THOUGH I'M SO FAR

1191
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
AWAY IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY, WE

1192
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
DEEP THAT BOND TOGETHER UNTIL I

1193
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
COME HOME.

1194
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
>> YOUR SON, I SAW SOMETHING HE

1195
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
DID AT SCHOOL, WHERE HE WROTE

1196
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
ABOUT HOW PROUD HE IS OF YOU,

1197
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
BECAUSE YOU'RE DEPLOYED AND

1198
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
YOU'RE SAVING PEOPLE'S LIVES.

1199
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
>> YEAH, HE CAN BECOME A

1200
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
STICKLER AND HARDHEADED, BUT I

1201
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
THINK THAT DEEP DOWN INSIDE, HE

1202
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
ENJOYS AND FEELS SO APPRECIATIVE

1203
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
FOR WHAT I DO, AND ESPECIALLY MY

1204
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
DAUGHTER, HALLEY, TOO.

1205
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
THEY DEFINITELY KNOW WHAT I'M

1206
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
DOING AND THEY KNOW THAT I'M

1207
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
SAFE.
SO THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

1208
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
>> AND YOU SAID, THE ONE THING

1209
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
SHE TOLD YOU IS THAT HE WAS

1210
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
WEARING HIS PACKERS SHIRT.

1211
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
>> YEAH, YEAH.

1212
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I DON'T KNOW IF I EMBEDDED IT IN

1213
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
HIS HEAD WHEN HE WAS SUCH A

1214
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
YOUNG KID, ABOUT BEING A PACKERS

1215
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
FAN, BUT AS SOON AS HE KNEW HE

1216
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
WAS GOING TO BE ON TV, HE HAD TO

1217
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
WEAR HIS PACKERS JERSEY.

1218
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
>> YOU WERE TELLING ME A STORY

1219
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
ABOUT THE PACKERS WERE PLAYING,

1220
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
BUT YOU WEREN'T HOME.

1221
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
>> YEAH, EVERY SUNDAY OR SO,

1222
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I'LL CALL AND ASK HIM, AND I'LL

1223
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
BE LIKE, JOSH, DO YOU KNOW WHO

1224
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
THE PACKERS ARE PLAYING THIS

1225
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
WEEK?
AND HE KNOWS TO A T WHO THEY'RE

1226
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
PLAYING.

1227
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
AND I'LL ASK HIM IF THEY'RE

1228
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
GOING TO WIN OR IF THEY'RE GOING

1229
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
TO LOSE.

1230
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
AND HE ALWAYS VOTES AGAINST THE

1231
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
PACKERS FOR SOME REASON.

1232
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
AND I ASKED HIM, JOSH, WHY DO

1233
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
YOU ALWAYS VOTE AGAINST THE

1234
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
PACKERS, AND HE SAID, BECAUSE

1235
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
YOU'RE NOT HERE, DAD.

1236
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
AND I GET THAT.
A 5-YEAR-OLD SON --

1237
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
>> HE MISSES YOU.

1238
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
HE JUST WANTS YOU THERE.

1239
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
>> DEFINITELY.
>>> NEXT, MY INTERVIEW FALLY

1240
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
AKUFY.
THEY TRIED TO KILL HER AND HER

1241
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
TWO LITTLE GIRLS, BUT SHE'S

1242
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
STILL GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT

1243
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
OF AFGHANISTAN IN 2014.

1244
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
HER VIEW OF WHERE THE COUNTRY IS

1245
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
HEADED AND AN INSPIRATIONAL

1246
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
MEETING WITH HER TWO DAUGHTERS.

1247
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
SHE'S NEXT.
te"

1248
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Look who's back.

1249
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Again?
It's embarrassing

1250
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It's embarrassing!

1251
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
We can see you Carl.

1252
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
We can totally see you.

1253
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Come on you're better than
this...all that prowling around.

1254
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Yeah, you're the
king of the jungle.

1255
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Have you thought about going
vegan Carl?

1256
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
HAHAHA!!

1257
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You know folks who save hundreds
of dollars by

1258
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
switching to GEICO
sure are happy.

1259
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
How happy are they Jimmy?

1260
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Happier than antelope with
night-vision goggles.

1261
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Nice!

1262
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Get happy. Get GEICO.

1263
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Fifteen minutes could save you
fifteen percent or more.

1264

FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN,

1290
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
AND MADE A MONTHLY TRIP TO THE
CLINIC TO GET HIS BLOOD TESTED.

1291
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

1292
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000

A DIFFERENT OPTION:

1293
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
ONCE-A-DAY XARELTO®.

1294
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
XARELTO® IS THE FIRST AND ONLY

ONCE-A-DAY PRESCRIPTION
BLOOD THINNER

1296

FOR PATIENTS WITH AFIB

00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
NOT CAUSED
BY A HEART VALVE PROBLEM,

1298
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE
ROUTINE BLOOD MONITORING.

1299
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
LIKE WARFARIN,
XARELTO® IS PROVEN EFFECTIVE

1300
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
TO REDUCE THE RISK
OF AN AFIB-RELATED STROKE.

1301
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
THERE IS LIMITED DATA
ON HOW THESE DRUGS COMPARE

1302
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
WHEN WARFARIN IS WELL MANAGED.

1303
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
NO ROUTINE BLOOD MONITORING

1304
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
MEANS BOB CAN SPEND HIS
EXTRA TIME HOWEVER HE LIKES.

NO DIETARY RESTRICTIONS,

1310
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
DO NOT STOP TAKING
XARELTO® RIVAROXABAN

1311
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
WITHOUT TALKING TO THE DOCTOR
WHO PRESCRIBES IT FOR YOU.

1312
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
STOPPING MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK
OF HAVING A STROKE.

1313
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY

1314
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
IF YOU DEVELOP ANY SIGNS
OR SYMPTOMS OF BLEEDING,

1315
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING
OR TINGLING.

1316
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
YOU MAY HAVE A HIGHER RISK
OF BLEEDING

1317
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
IF YOU TAKE XARELTO®
WITH ASPIRIN PRODUCTS,

1318

NSAIDS OR BLOOD THINNERS.

1319
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
BEFORE TAKING XARELTO®

1320
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE
ABNORMAL BLEEDING.

1321
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
XARELTO® CAN CAUSE BLEEDING,
WHICH CAN BE SERIOUS,

1322
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
AND RARELY MAY LEAD TO DEATH.

1323
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
YOU ARE LIKELY TO BRUISE
MORE EASILY ON XARELTO®,

1324
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
AND IT MAY TAKE LONGER
FOR BLEEDING TO STOP.

1325
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
TELL YOUR DOCTORS

1326
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
BEFORE ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
OR DENTAL PROCEDURES.

1327
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
BEFORE STARTING XARELTO®,
TELL YOUR DOCTOR

1328

ABOUT ANY CONDITIONS,
SUCH AS KIDNEY, LIVER

1329
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000

1387
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000

1388
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000

00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY RISK TO THAT,

1437
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
BUT IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE

1438
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
DETERMINED TO DO?

1439
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
>> I DON'T WANT BUY THIS

1440
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
ARGUMENT, WHEN PEOPLE SAY, THERE

1441
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
IS NO CHANCE.
IT'S JUST THE MIND-SET, IF A

1442
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
WOMAN HAS A CHANCE IN OTHER

1443
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
NEIGHBORING MUSLIM COUNTRIES OF

1444
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
AFGHANISTAN, WHY NOT IN

1445
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
AFGHANISTAN?

1446
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
AFGHANISTAN HAS A LONG HISTORY

1447
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
OF CIVILIZATION.

1448
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
>> AS A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT,

1449
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
YOU'RE PART OF A GOVERNMENT THAT

1450
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
IS RANKED 179 IN CORRUPTION IN

1451
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
THE WORLD, OUT OF 180.

1452
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
THAT'S A PRETTY TERRIBLE RATING.

1453
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
AND I'M CURIOUS, BECAUSE, YOU

1454
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
SIT HERE AS SOMEONE WHO'S TRYING

1455
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
TO HELP YOUR PEOPLE, BUT DOES

1456
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
THIS MEAN THAT EVEN YOU, WHO HAS

1457
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
BEEN A HERO FOR WOMEN AND

1458
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
INSPIRATION, A FIGHTER, THE

1459
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
WORLD, THE OUTSIDE WORLD, WOULD

1460
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
THEY DEFINE YOU AS CORRUPT,

1461
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
EVERY MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT

1462
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
CORRUPT, GIVEN THESE OVERALL

1463
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
NUMBERS THAT WE SEE?

1464
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
ARE WE MISSING SOMETHING?

1465
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
>> I THINK, YES.

1466
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
WELL, 20% OF THE FANS WHO ARE

1467
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
COMING TO THE GOVERNMENT OF

1468
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
AFGHANISTAN, 80% ARE BEING SPENT

1469
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL

1470
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
ORGANIZATIONS.

1471
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
SO NOT ONLY IN THE BROADER

1472
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
PICTURE AS THE GOVERNMENT OF

1473
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
AFGHANISTAN, ALTHOUGH I AM NOT

1474
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
IN POWER, IN A WAY THAT I AM NOT

1475
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
IN POSITION, WE ARE THE CRITICS

1476
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
OF THE GOVERNMENT, WE ARE

1477
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
REFORMISTS, WE WOULD LIKE TO

1478
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
BRING CHANGES.

1479
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I AGREE IN A WAY THAT THERE IS

1480
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
CORRUPTION.
NOT ONLY MONEY CORRUPTION, BUT

1481
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
ALSO POLITICAL CORRUPTION,

1482
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
ADMINISTRATIVE CORRUPTION.
ALL OF THAT IS THERE.

1483
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
>> FAWZIA HAS TWO YOUNG

1484
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
DAUGHTERS.
THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL, SMART,

1485
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
INSPIRING GIRLS AND I WAS CURE

1486
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
ABOUT HOW SHE FELT ABOUT HOW SHT

1487
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
THEM STAYING HERE IN

1488

AFGHANISTAN.

1489
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
IF THE TALIBAN COMES BACK.

1490
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
>> SO, YOU WANT YOUR DAUGHTERS

1491
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
TO STAY AFTER THE U.S. LEAVES TO

1492
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
BE ABLE TO STAY IN AFGHANISTAN?

1493
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
>> THEY BOTH WANT TO STAY HERE.

1494
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
BUT IF THINGS GO TO THE -- GOD

1495
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
FORBID IF THINGS GO REALLY BAD,

1496
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I THINK THEN WE WILL HAVE NO

1497
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
OPTION.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1498
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THE

1499
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
U.S. LEAVES?

1500
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
>> THIS IS OUR COUNTRY AND WE

1501
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
CANNOT LET OUR COUNTRY GET DOWN.

1502
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
WHATEVER HAPPEN, I NEED TO STAY

1503
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
IN MY COUNTRY.

1504
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
>> AND WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE

1505
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
WHEN YOU GROW UP?

1506
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
>> A PRESIDENT.

1507
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
>> YOU WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT?

1508
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
>> YEAH.

1509
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
>> THE PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN?

1510
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
>> YEAH.
>> AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?

1511
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
>> I WANT TO BE A SPACE

1512
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000

>> A SPACE ENGINEER?

1513
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
>> YES.

1514
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
>> SO PEOPLE WHO SAY GIRLS IN

1515
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
AFGHANISTAN ARE GOING TO HAVE

1516
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
BIG PROBLEMS, MAYBE THEY DON'T

1517
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
KNOW ABOUT YOU?

1518
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
>> YES, MAYBE.

1519
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
>> AND WHAT ABOUT -- WHAT ARE

1520
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
YOUR WORRIES ABOUT SCHOOL?

1521
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO

1522
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
BE THE SAME NEXT YEAR WHEN THE

1523
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
U.S. LEAVES, THAT YOU WILL BE

1524
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
ABLE TO STAY IN SCHOOL, OR ARE

1525
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
YOU WORRIED THERE COULD BE

1526
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
CHANGES THAT HAPPEN FAST?

1527
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
>> I THINK THERE COULD BE

1528
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
CHANGES, MAYBE TALIBAN COME

1529
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
AGAIN AND MAYBE NOT.

1530
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I DON'T KNOW REALLY.

1531
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
BUT I HOPE THEY DON'T COME.

1532
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
>> I KNOW YOU WENT TODAY AND

1533
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
HEARD YOUR MOM SPEAK.

1534
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
>> YES.

1535
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
>> WHAT DID YOU THINK?

1536
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
>> I THINK SHE REALLY -- SHE WAS

1537
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
GOOD AND I'M PROUD OF HER.

1538
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I'M PROUD OF BEING HER DAUGHTER.

1539
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
AND THE SPEECH WAS REALLY NICE.

1540
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
>> THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH.

1541
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

1542
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
>> A SPACE ENGINEER AND

1543
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
PRESIDENT.
THAT WAS AN INSPIRING MOMENT FOR

1544
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
ME TO SEE THOSE GIRLS.

1545
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
AS YOU OBVIOUSLY NOTICED, THEY

1546
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
ARE VERY DEDICATED TO THEIR

1547
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
EDUCATION.

1548
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
WHEN WE WERE THERE, WE SAW THEM

1549
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
UP IN THEIR ROOMS WORKING, THEY

1550
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
WERE STUDYING.

1551
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO MAKE SURE

1552
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
THAT EVERYONE AT HOME

1553
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
UNDERSTANDS WHAT THAT MEANS.

1554
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000

When you're carrying

C-MAX has a nice little trait,

1594

You see, C-MAX helps
you load your freight,

with its foot-activated
lift gate.

all you'll see,

00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
TALKING ABOUT HIS LIFE HERE WHEN
AFGHANISTAN WAS A TOTALLY

1614
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
DIFFERENT PLACE.

1615
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
IN THE 1960s AND '70s,

1616
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
AFGHANISTAN WAS A CULTURAL

1617
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
HOTBED, ATTRACTING THE LIKES OF

1618
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
JAZZ GREATS DUKE ELLINGTON AND

1619
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
DAVE BRUBECK.

1620
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
>> DAVE WAS IN KABUL, AND HE HAS

1621
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
COMPOSED A BEAUTIFUL PIECE.

1622
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
>> AS AN OFFICIAL IN THE

1623
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
MINISTER OF CULTURE AND

1624
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
INFORMATION, 77-YEAR-OLD FAIZ

1625
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
EXPERIENCED KABUL IN ITS HEYDAY

1626
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN.

1627
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
>> OUR HOUSE WAS A PLACE WHERE

1628
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
ALL THE ARTISTS, INTELLECTUALS

1629
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, WOULD

1630
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
BE WELCOMED AND AFGHAN

1631
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
COUNTERPARTS WOULD BE INVITED TO

1632
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
EXCHANGE IDEAS, TO LAUGH.

1633
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
>> YOU HAD THE SALON OF KABUL.

1634
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1635
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
>> BUT IN 1978, FAIZ AND HIS

1636
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
FAMILY FLED THE COUNTRY AFTER

1637
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
REVOLUTION AND THE SOVIET

1638
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
INVASION.

1639
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
>> IT SADDENS ME THAT ON THE

1640
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
SPOT THAT I HAD BUILT A STAGE

1641
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
FOR DUKE ELLINGTON TO PERFORM IS

1642
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
THAT AWFUL FOOTAGE PLAYED ALL

1643
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
OVER THE WORLD OF A WOMAN BEING

1644
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
EXECUTED.
>> THE SOCCER STADIUM ONCE

1645
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
HOSTED PRESIDENTS AND

1646
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
DIGNITARIES BUT BECAME AN ARENA

1647
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
FOR PUBLIC EXECUTIONS.

1648
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
MORE RECENTLY SOCCER HAS

1649
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
RETURNED BUT AFTER MORE THAN 30

1650
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
YEARS OF WAR AND OPPRESSION,

1651
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
FAIZ SAYS KABUL IS NOT WHAT IT

1652
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
ONCE WAS.

1653
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
FOUR YEARS HE WENT BACK AND

1654
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
FOUND HIS ONCE PALATIAL

1655
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
RESIDENCE BOMBED OUT, STRIPPED.

1656
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
>> WHEN YOU FIRST WENT BACK AND

1657
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
SAW WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT WAS THAT

1658
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
MOMENT LIKE?

1659
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
>> IT WAS A VERY, VERY SAD

1660
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
MOMENT.
>> HIS HOUSE HAS SINCE BEEN TORN

1661
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
DOWN AND TURNED INTO A WEDDING

1662
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
HALL.

1663
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
THROUGHOUT THE CITY, COUNTLESS

1664
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
HOMES AND HISTORICAL MONIME YOU

1665
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
MEA --

1666
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
MONUMENTS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.

1667
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
THERE'S A SMALL SIGN OF HOPE FOR

1668
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
THE FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN.
>> I'M HOPING THAT SOME DAY

1669
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
MAYBE MY CHILDREN, THEIR

1670
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
CHILDREN WOULD BE LIKE ALL THE

1671
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
OTHER MINORITIES WHO HAVE COME

1672
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
TO AMERICA, LIKE ITALIANS OR

1673
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
GREEKS OR IRISH OR ANYBODY, THAT

1674
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
THEY'LL GO TO THE OLD COUNTRY

1675
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
JUST TO SEE THEIR ROOTS.

1676
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
SOME DAY I HOPE THAT WILL

1677
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
HAPPEN.
>> TOMORROW NIGHT ON "OUTFRONT"

1678
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
MORE OF MY EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

1679
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
WITH THE DEFENSE SECRETARY, LEON

1680
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
PANETTA.

1681
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
WE TALKED ABOUT IRAN.

1682
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
HE HAD SOME SURPRISING COMMENTS

1683
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
ON IRAN'S PURSUIT OF A NUCLEAR

1684
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
WEAPON AND HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT

1685
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
THE GENERAL PETRAEUS AFFAIR.

1686
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY

1687
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
MIND THAT THE OVERWHELMING

1688
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
MAJORITY OF OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN

1689
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
UNIFORM ABIDE BY THE HIGHEST

1690
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
STANDARDS.

1691
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE THAT,

1692
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
YOU
