00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
WORDS CANNOT ADEQUATELY

14
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
EXPRESS OUR SENSE OF LOSS.

15
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
DARRYL SCOTT'S DAUGHTER RACHEL

16
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000

21
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
IT CAUSES YOU TO RELIVE

22
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
PAINFUL MOMENTS 13 YEARS AGO.

23
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I WANT TO BEGIN BYING WHAT

24
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THAT MOMENT WAS LIKE WHEN YOU

25
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
REALIZED THAT RACHEL, YOUR

26
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
DAUGHTER WAS ONE OF THE

27
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
VICTIMS IN THE COLUMBINE

28
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
SHOOTING?

29
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT

30
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
HAPPENS, YOU EXPERIENCE SUCH A

31
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
SHOCK AND THERE IS IT A

32
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DISBELIEF.

33
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I KEPT EXPECTING HER TO WALK

34
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
THROUGH THE DOOR AND EXPECTING

35
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
TO SEE HER AND IT TOOK A WHILE

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
FOR IT TO HIT DEAD CENTER THAT

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
SHE WAS GONE.

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
THAT HAPPENS A LOT WITH

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
PARENTS WHO DON'T EXPECT TO

40
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
LOSE YOUR CHILD.

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
YOU NEVER EXPECT IT TO HAPPEN.

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
IT WAS A NIGHTMARE.

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
NYOU KNOW, THE TOUGHEST THING

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
TO WHAT TO SAY TO THE PARENTS.

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
IF YOU BE IN THEIR HOMES

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
TONIGHT AND SIT ACROSS FROM

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
THEM AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

48
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
THAT COMES FRO

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WHO CAN

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
SAY I DO KNOW HOW YOU FEEL IN

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
>> THEY DON'T NEED ME.

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
THEY NEED THEIR FRIEND FAMILY.

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
BUT IF I WAS IN THE SWADINGS,

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I WOULD PUT MY ARM ATHEM AND

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
CRY WITH THEM.

56
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
THERE IS IT NOTHING YOU CAN

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
SAY IN THAT MOMENT.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I WOULD NOT HAVE WANTED A

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
STRANGER TRYING TO TELL ME

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
SOMETHING OR GIVE ME INPUT.

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
YOU JUST HAVE TO GRIEVE.

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
BEST TING TO DO IS GRIEVE WITH

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
THEM ASK LOVE THEM.

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
IT IS SIMPLE ADVICE BUT THE

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
BEST.

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
NRACHEL WASED DO YOU BELIEVE

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000

SHE SAID YES.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
SHE COULD HAVE SAID NO .

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
AND THEN SHE WAS KILLED.

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
HAVE THERE BEEN TIMES WHEN YOU

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000

.

133
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
'S LOT OF QUESTIONS REMAIN

134
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF THE

135
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
SHOW.

136
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
DR. JULY WE ALWAYS HEAR AFTER

137
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
ONE OF THESE EVENTS THAT THERE

138
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
WERE SIGNS THAT THE PERSON WAS

139
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
GETTING OFF AND SIGNALS THAT

140
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

141
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
SEE .

142
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
WHAT ARE THOSE SIGNALS AND

143
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
SIGNS THAT WE OUGHT TO WATCH

144
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
FOR IN PEOPLE?

145
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
>> THE BEST PREDICTOR OF

146
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
VIOLENT BEHAVIOR IS THE

147
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
SYMPTOMS THAT A PERSON

148
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
DISPLAYED IN THE PAST.

149
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
AND IN A PROBLEM WITH

150
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.

151
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO PEG AND

152
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
YOU SEE PEOPLE GET WITH DRAWN.

153
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
IF YOU SEE A PERSON THAT YOU

154
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
KNOW AND LOVE AND CHANGING IN

155
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
THEIR BEHAVIOR.

156
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
AND GETTING WITH DRAWN AND

157
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
PERHAPS THEY ARE HAVING

158
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
EXTENDED PERIODS OF MOOD

159
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
DIFFICULTIES.

160
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
AND WHAT I OFTEN SEE IN FAMILY

161
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
MEMBERS AND FRIENDS OF THESE

162
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
PEOPLE, THEY WILL IGNORE THESE

163
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
THINGS OR GO BOO DENIAL ABOUT

164
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
THEM.
TYPICALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT

165
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
ACTING THE NORMAL WAY THAT

166
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
THEY BEHAVE, AND ARE TARTING

167
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
TO DISPLAY CERTAIN BEHAVIORS.

168
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
OF SUBTLE THINGINGS.

169
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
START -- WITH STRANGE BELIEFS

170
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
AND FIXATED ON THIPPINGS THAT

171
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
MAKE -- THINGS THAT MAKE THEM

172
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
ANGRY.
GETTING THEM INTO SEE SOMEONE

173
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
AND A PROFESSIONAL AND SEE IF

174
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
THIS IS IT A PASSING PHASE OR

175
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT IS A

176
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
TIP OF A ICEBERG.

177
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
A LOT OF THE ONOUS IS ON FRIND

178
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
FAMILY TO GET THEM TREATMENT.

179
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
THEY BRING POEM IN MY OFFICE

180
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
TO BE EVALUATED AND OTHER

181
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
TIMES, PEOPLE ARE IN DENIAL.

182
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
IF YOU HAVE A FRIEND OR FAMILY

183
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
NUMBER THAT NIDES TO BE

184
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
ASSESSED WE NEED TO GET THEM

185
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
IN THERE AND ACCEPT THE

186
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
DIAGNOSIS.
>> FAMILY MEMBERS ARE FEARFUL

187
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
TO TAKE ONE MUCH THEIR

188
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
CHILDREN TO SOMEONE LIKE YOU

189
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
AND SO AFRAID IT WILL CREATE

190

AND THIS IS IT A CASE AND I

283
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
SURE MENTAL ILWAS INVOLVED AND

284
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I KNOW THE DEVIL WAS INVOLVED

285
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000

286
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000

288
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
GOD DID NOT CREATE THIS, BUT

289
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
GOD CAN USE AND TAKE THAT

290
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
WHICH WAS INTENDED FOR EVIL

291
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000

292
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000

GOD REDEEMED SOMETHING.

297
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE A

298
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
BUMPER STICKER THEOLOGY.

GOOD THING.
I HEARD PEOPLE TRY TO CREATE

306

310
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000

WE NEED TO HATE IT WE NEED TO

318
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
HATE THAT WHICH IS EVIL.

319
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
WE NEED TO PRAY AGAINST IT AND

320
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
WORK AGAINST IT AND RAGE

321
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000

322
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000

323
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000

324
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
STILL GOOD.

325
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I THINK TWO OR THREE THIPPINGS

326
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER.

327
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
WE NEED TO PRAY OUR PAIN OUT.

328
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
