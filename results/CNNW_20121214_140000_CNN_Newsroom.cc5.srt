COVERING WAR?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD MAKE

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
YOU NEVER EVER DO THAT AGAIN.

400 TROOPS TO OUR NATO ALLY

SYRIA AGAINST ITS SCUD MISSILES

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000

WITH THE TROOPS THAT ARE

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
NECESSARY TO MAN THOSE BATTERIES

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
SO THAT WE CAN HELP TURKEY HAVE

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
THE KIND OF MISSILE DEFENSE IT

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
MAY VERY WELL NEED IN DEALING

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000

BEIRUT FOLLOWING THE LATEST

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
DEVELOPMENTS.
NICK IS ON THE PHONE, WHAT CAN

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
YOU TELL US?

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
>> WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
LOCATION WHERE THE AMERICAN

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
TROOPS ARE GOING TO BE STATIONED

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
BUT THE GERMAN PARLIAMENT

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
RATIFIED PART OF ITS

71
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
CONTRIBUTION, THERE WILL BE
THREE NATO NATIONS GIVING TROOPS

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
TOWARD THIS.

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
THE U.S. TWO BATTERIES AND 400

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
TROOPS, THE GERMANS ARE EXPECTED

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
TO MAKE A SIMILAR CONTRIBUTION

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
AS WELL AS THE NETHERLANDS AS

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
WELL.

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
IT PUTS NATO FORCES IN THE

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
VOLUME TIRE AREA.

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THE BACK STORY HOW WE GOT TO

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
HERE TWO MONTHS AGO THERE WERE

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
EXCHANGES OF FIRE, THE SYRIAN

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
ARMY ACCUSED OF SHELLING AREAS

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
INSIDE TURKEY, CAUSING

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
DESTRUCTION AND INJURY TO

86
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
TURKEY, AND TURKEY FIRING BACK

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
AND ASKING FOR NATO BACKUP.

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
THERE WAS NEVER ANY DOUBT NATO

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
WOULD COME TO TURKEY.

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL MANPOWER

91
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
AND WEAPONRY RIGHT ON THE SYRIAN

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
BORDER.

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
NATO VERY CLEAR IT'S PURELY FOR

94
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
DEFENSE OF TURKEY, NOT MEANT TO

95
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
ENFORCE WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING

96
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
MIGHT BE A NO FLY ZONE.

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
YOU HEART SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
LEON PA NET TA, CONCERNS OF

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS USE.

100
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
THE U.S. HAS A PLAN TO RESPOND.

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
NOT CLEAR IF PATRIOTS WILL BE

102
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
INVOLVED BUT CERTAINLY IN THIS

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
21-MONTH-LONG REVOLT, NATO, THE

104
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
BIGGEST MACHINERY IN THE WORLD

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
IN THAT VOLATILE AREA.

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
>> NICK PATON WALSH, THANK YOU

107
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
VERY MUCH.
>>> IN WASHINGTON A WITHDRAWAL

108
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
AND A SURRENDER.

109
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE DROPS OUT

110
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
OF THE RUNNING FOR SECRETARY OF

111
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
STATE.

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THE JOB SEEMED TO BE HERS BUT

113
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
THEN THERE WAS A DEAD LAY TACK

114
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
ON ITS U.S. CONSULATE IN LIBYA,

115
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
DAYS AFTER U.S. AMBASSADOR CHRIS

116
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
STEVENS AND THREE OTHER

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
ERICANS WERE KILLED, RICE SAID

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
IT WAS A SPONTANEOUS PROTEST

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
THAT GOT OUT OF HAND RATHER THAN

120
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
A PLANNED TERRORIST ATTACK.

121
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
REPUBLICANS SAY SHE WAS LYING TO

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
DOWNPLAY HER BOSS'S FAILED

123
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
POLICIES.
RICE DEFENDS HER HANDLING EVEN

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
NOW.
>> I WAS VERY CAREFUL TO EXPLAIN

125
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
THAT THE INFORMATION WAS

126
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
PRELIMINARY, AND IT COULD CHANGE

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
AND YET I THINK IT WAS

128
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
MISCONSTRUED AND CONTORTED INTO

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
SOMETHING MUCH MORE NEFARIOUS

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
THAT WAS NEVER INDEED THE CASE

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
NOR MY INTENTION.

132
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
>> WELL THE BACKLASH AGAINST

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
RICE ONLY GREW AFTER SHE MET

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
WITH CONCERNED LAWMAKERS BEHIND

135
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
CLOSE DOORS.
THE ODDS OF A CONFIRMATION HAD

136
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
GROWN SO BLEAK THE WHITE HOUSE

137
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
NEVER WENT THROUGH A FORMAL

138
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
NOMINATION.

139
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
>> I HADN'T MADE A DECISION

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
ABOUT WHO WOULD BE MY NEXT

141
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
SECRETARY OF STATE.

142
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT SUSAN WAS

143
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
QUALIFIED.
THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE

144
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
QUALIFIED AS WELL.

145
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
HER INTEREST IS IN SERVING ME,

146
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY SERVING THE

147
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
COUNTRY AND SHE'S DONE AN

148
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
OUTSTANDING JOB.

149
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I COULD NOT BE PROUDER WITH HER.

150
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
SHE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ONE OF

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
THE TOP MEMBERS OF MY NATIONAL

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
SECURITY TEAM.
>> WE ARE COVERING ALL ANGLES

153
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
WITH FOREIGN AFFAIRS REPORTER

154
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
ALYSE LAVITT AND BRIANNA KEILAR.

155
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
BRIANA, THE PRESIDENT WAS VOCAL

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
IN HIS SUPPORT.

157
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
AFTER TWO MONTHS, A LACK OF

158
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
CONFIDENCE HERE?

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
>> Reporter: I THINK DEFINITELY

160
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
THERE WAS A LACK OF CONFIDENCE,

161
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
THAT THIS WAS A FIGHT THAT THE

162
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
PRESIDENT WANTED TO HAVE RIGHT

163
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
NOW.
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT PRESIDENT

164
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
OBAMA HAS A GREAT AFFINITY FOR

165
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
AMBASSADOR RICE.
YOU CAN SEE THAT WHEN HE TALKS

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
ABOUT HER.

167
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
HE CAME TO HER DEFENSE IN THE

168
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
LAST MONTH QUITE A BIT BUT I

169
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN

170
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
ABOUT THE TIMING AND WHETHER

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
THIS WAS A FIGHT THAT HE WANTED

172
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
TO HAVE.

173
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
HE HAD SAID IN HIS FIRST, IN HIS

174
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
PRESS CONFERENCE FOLLOWING HIS

175
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
RE-ELECTION THAT IF HE THOUGHT

176
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
SHE WAS THE BEST PERSON FOR THE

177
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
JOB, THAT HE WOULD NOMINATE HER

178
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
BUT HE WENT ON TO NOT PIN

179
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
HIMSELF IN, NOT TO MAKE A

180
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
DECISION, AND SOME OF THE

181
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
CRITICS WHO WERE IN THE CORNER

182
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
OF SUSAN RICE SAY THIS MAY HAVE

183
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
ACTUALLY SEALED HER FATE.

184
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
SHE ENDED UP HEADING UP TO

185
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
CAPITOL HILL TRYING TO DEFEND

186
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
HERSELF AGAINST HER ROLE

187
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING WHAT

188
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
HAPPENED IN BENGHAZI AND TRYING

189
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
TO EXPLAIN THAT ON BEHALF OF THE

190
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
ADMINISTRATION.
WHEN SHE WENT UP TO CAPITOL HILL

191
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
TO MEET WITH LAWMAKERS THE

192
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
VISITS BACKFIRED.

193
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
THEY RAISED A LOT OF QUESTIONS

194
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
AND SHE WAS THERE TO TRY TO

195
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
ANSWER THEM AND TRY TO ASSUAGE

196
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
CONCERNS, THAT WAS TRUE WITH

197
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
SENATOR SUSAN HOLLINS OF MAINE,

198
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
A REPUBLICAN BUT A MODERATE AND

199
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
THAT WAS SEEN AS VERY TROUBLING

200
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
IN ALL OF THIS PROCESS.

201
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
SOME CRITIC ALSO SAY, DON, THAT

202
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
WITHOUT THE NOMINATION, SHE WAS

203
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
LEFT TWISTING IN THE WIND BUT

204
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
THERE'S ALSO THIS SENSE THAT
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS A WHOLE LOT

205
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
ON HIS PLATE.

206
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
HE'S OBVIOUSLY INVOLVED IN THIS

207
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
FIGHT OVER THE STRIKING A DEAL

208
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
ON THE FISCAL CLIFF, AND THEN

209
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
GOING INTO NEXT YEAR, A LOT OF

210
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
GOALS OBVIOUSLY TO FOLLOW ON

211
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THAT ENTITLEMENT REFORM,

212
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
SPENDING CUTS, TAX REFORM AND

213
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
DON'T FORGET IMMIGRATION REFORM

214
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
IS ALSO A PRIORITY, SO I THINK

215
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
THERE WAS A SENSE THAT DO YOU

216
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
REALLY SPEND ALL OF THIS

217
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
POLITICAL CAPITAL ON THIS FIGHT

218
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
WHEN THERE'S SO MANY OTHER

219
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
THINGS TO DO.

220
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
>> AND SO SHE REFERENCED THAT AS

221
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
WELL IN HER LETTER THAT SHE PUT

222
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
OUT YESTERDAY.

223
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
ALYSE, YOU COVER THE STATE

224
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
DEPARTMENT.
WHO IS ON THE SHORT LIST TO BE

225
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
NOMINATED HERE?
JOHN KERRY OF COURSE.

226
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
>> WELL, DON, HE'S REALLY THE

227
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
ONLY NAME ON THE SHORT LIST.

228
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
SENATOR KERRY AS THE CHAIR OF

229
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS

230
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
COMMITTEE HAS A LOT OF WORLD

231
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
STATURE, HAS A LOT OF

232
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
RELATIONSHIPS WITH WORLD LEADERS

233
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
AND IN THE PAST HE'S REALLY DONE

234
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
A LOT FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA.

235
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
IF YOU REMEMBER, WHEN JOHN KERRY

236
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN

237
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
2004, HE GAVE THEN SENATOR OBAMA

238
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
HIS FIRST KIND OF SHOT ON THE

239
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
WORLD STAGE AT THE DEMOCRATIC

240
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
CONVENTION.

241
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
HE'S ALSO BEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA'S

242
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
PARTNER IN TERMS OF PREPPING FOR

243
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
THE DEBATE.

244
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
HE SERVED IN AS MITT ROMNEY, AND

245
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
ALSO SENATOR KERRY HAS ALSO DONE

246
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
A LOT OF WORK FOR THE

247
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OF

248
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
TROUBLESHOOTING AROUND THE

249
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
WORLD.
THIS GUY GOT AFGHAN PRESIDENT

250
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
HAMID KARZAI TO AGREE TO A

251
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
RUNOFF ELECTION.

252
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
HE MEETS WITH THE PAKISTANIS

253
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
WHENEVER THERE IS A PROBLEM, MET

254
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
WITH BASHAR AL ASSAD AT ONE

255
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
POINT.
SO HE'S REALLY SEEN AS ALTHOUGH

256
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
SUSAN RICE WAS SEEN AS SOMEONE

257
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
WHO COULD HAVE BEEN THE

258
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
PRESIDENT'S FIRST CHOICE HE'S

259
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
CERTAINLY A CANDIDATE THAT IS UP

260
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
TO THE TASK AND HAS A LOT OF

261
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
FOREIGN POLICY CREDIBILITY

262
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
AROUND THE WORLD.

263
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
DON?
>> ELISE LABOTT AND BRIANNA

264
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
KEILAR THANKS OBOTH OF YOU.

265
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
>>> WHEN IT COMES TO THE FISCAL

266
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
CLIFF STILL NO DEAL AND NOW THE

267
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
DEBT CEILING IS CAUGHT IN THE

268
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
CROSS-FIRE HERE.

269
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
SPECIFICALLY A PART OF THE WHITE

270
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
HOUSE'S FISCAL CLIFF PLAN THAT

271
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
WOULD GIVE THE PRESIDENT THE

272
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
POWER TO INCREASE THE DEBT LIMIT

273
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
WITHOUT CONGRESS THAT IS.

274
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
BOEHNER MAKING IT CLEAR THAT IT

275
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
IS NOT UP FOR A DEBATE.

276
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
>> DO YOU THINK THAT SENATOR

277
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
REID OR THEN SENATOR OBAMA WOULD

278
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
HAVE EVER GIVEN TO PRESIDENT

279
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
GEORGE W. BUSH THE UNLIMITED

280
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
ABILITY TO RAISE THE DEBT LIMIT?

281
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I KNOW THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

282
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
DOING IT NOW.

283
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE

284
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
THAT SENATOR REID OR THEN

285
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
SENATOR OBAMA WOULD HAVE DONE

286
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
THAT?

287
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
ZERO.
CONGRESS IS NEVER GOING TO GIVE

288
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
UP OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THE

289
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
PURSE.
>> SO FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA'S

290
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
PART, HE IS DIGGING IN AS WELL

291
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
ON AN AREA THAT HAS BEEN KEY

292
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
STICKING POINT AND THAT'S TAXES.

293
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE

294
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
CAN DO RIGHT NOW IS MAKE SURE

295
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THAT MIDDLE CLASS TAXES DO NOT

296
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
GO UP.

297
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
THAT'S THE BEST THING FOR THE

298
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
ECONOMY, BEST THING FOR AMERICAN

299
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
FAMILIES AND IF WE DO THAT,

300
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
SENATE'S ALREADY PASSED THIS

301
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
BILL.

302
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE READY TO

303
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
PASS T I'M READY TO SIGN IT.

304
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
THE ONLY HOLDOUTS ARE THE HOUSE

305
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
REPUBLICANS.
IF WE GET THAT DONE THAT WILL

306
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
TAKE THE EDGE OFF THINGS.

307
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
WE'LL STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH

308
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
DEFICIT AND DEBT PROBLEMS.

309
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
98% OF AMERICANS, 97% OF SMALL

310
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
BUSINESSES WILL NOT SEE THEIR

311
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
TAXES GO UP.

312
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
WE SHOULD GET THAT DONE.

313
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
>> THE HOUSE IS SCHEDULED TO GO

314
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
HOME FOR THE YEAR TODAY BUT

315
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC

316
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
CANTOR SAYS MEMBERS COULD BE

317
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
WORKING LONGER WITH THE FISCAL

318
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
CLIFF STILL UNRESOLVED.

319
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
>>> DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

320
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
IT COULD BE WORTH $5,000 TO YOU.

321
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
THE FBI IS HOPING THE REWARD

322
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
WILL LEAD TO AN ARREST OF A

323
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
ROBBER WHO HAS HIT 13 BANKS FROM

324
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
VIRGINIA TO CALIFORNIA.

325
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
HE'S BEING CALLED THE RAY BANDIT

326
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
BECAUSE OF HIS BIG SUNGLASSES

327
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
AND DIFFERING DISGUISES.

328
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
>>> A FUNNY MOMENT FROM THE

EAGLES GAME.

331

THE HELMETS OF ANDRE SMITH AND

332
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
BRANDON GRAHAM GOT STUCK

333
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
TOGETHER.

334
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THE REF HAD TO HELP SEPARATE

335
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
HEM.
GRAHAM CHUCKLED ABOUT IT.

336
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
THE WOEFUL EAGLES DIDN'T HAVE

337
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
MUCH MORE TO LAUGH ABOUT IN THIS

338
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
GAME, FIVE TURNOVERS AND LOST TO

339
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
THE BENGALS 34-13.

340
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
>>> TWO 11-YEAR-OLD BOYS, THAT

TROPHY THEY'RE HOLDING IS 13,000

342
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
YEARS OLD, 13,000 YEARS OLD.

343
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
BECAUSE IT'S FROM TROY,

344
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
MICHIGAN, THEY WERE SCOURING A

FROM A MACEDON, AN ELEPHANT LIKE

347
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
BEAST THAT DIED 10,000 YEARS

348
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
AGO.
THEY'RE CALLING IT THE COOLEST

349
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
SHOW AND TELL ITEM EVER.

350
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000

SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE USING A 3-D

352
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
PRINTER.
LAWMAKERS FEAR IT'S A MATTER OF

353
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
TIME BEFORE PEOPLE START MAKING

354
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
HOMEMADE GUNS.

355
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
...so as you can see, GEICO's
customer satisfaction is at 97%.

356
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Mmmm tasty.

357
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And cut! Very good.

358
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

359
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

360
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

361
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's not real.

362
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

363
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

364
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

365
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

366
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
HOW THEY'LL LIVE TOMORROW.

367
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
IT'S JUST TALK RIGHT NOW, DON,

552
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
BUT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE

553
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
EXPECTED THE MAKER OF TWINKIES

554
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
AND DING DONGS IS IN THE PROCESS

555
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
OF LIQUIDATING.

556
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
THE COMPANY CAN BE CHOPPED OFF

557
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
AND SOLD OFF IN BUSINESSES.

558
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
SINCE HOSTESS IS BANKRUPT THE

559
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
PIECES COME AT ROCK BOTTOM

560
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
PRICES.
MAKES TWINKIES AN ATTRACTIVE

561
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
BUY.
>> WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD

562
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
MARIBEL THE BRANDS WILL SURVIVE?

563
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
>> PRETTY GOOD.

564
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
THERE'S STILL VALUE, TWINKIE,

565
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
DING DONGS, HO-HOS.

566
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
BEFORE THEY WENT UNDER THEY HAD

567
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
$2 ABOUTLE IN ANNUAL SALES.

568
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
THERE'S STILL A MARKET.

569
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
THE PROBLEM WITH HOSTESS WAS

570
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
THEIR COST STRUCTURE.

571
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
THEY HAD PLANTS SPREAD ACROSS

572
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
DOZENS OF STATES, NOT EXACTLY

573
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
EFFICIENT AND THE COMPANIES SAID

574
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
LABOR COSTS WERE THE MAJOR

575
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
ISSUES.
WE MIGHT SEE IT START TO PLAY

576
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
OUT, THE LAST BATCH OF TWINKIES

577
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
HIT STORES IN CHICAGO THIS WEEK.

578
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
THE LINES THEY WERE OUT THE DOOR

579
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
AND WEDNESDAY THEY WERE ALL SOLD

580
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
OUT.

581
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
>> MARIBEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

582
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
APPRECIATE IT.
>>> A CRITICAL DAY FOR HEALTH

583
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
CARE REFORM AS STATES DECIDE TO

584
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
TAKE PART IN A KEY PORTION OF

585
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S AFFORDABLE

586
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
CARE ACT.

587
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
WE'LL EXPLAIN HOW IT COULD
AFFECT YOU.

588
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So now I can be in
the scene.

589
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
ADVAIR is
clinically proven to help

590
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
significantly improve

591
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
lung function.

592
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Unlike most COPD medications,

593
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
ADVAIR contains both an
anti-inflammatory

594
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and a
long-acting bronchodilator

595
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
working together to help improve
your lung function all day.

596
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
ADVAIR won't
replace fast-acting inhalers

597
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
for sudden symptoms

598
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and should not be used more
than twice a day.

599
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
People with
COPD taking ADVAIR

600
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
may have a higher chance
of pneumonia.

601
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
ADVAIR may increase your
risk of osteoporosis

602
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and some eye problems.

603
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Tell your doctor
if you have a heart condition

604
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
or high blood pressure before
taking ADVAIR.

605
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
If you're still
having difficulty breathing,

606
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
ask your doctor if including
ADVAIR could help

607
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
improve your lung function.

608
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT ACT.

673
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000

WILL SET UP THEIR OWN EXCHANGES

675
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
WHICH WILL REQUIRE RESIDENTS TO
SELECT A HEALTH CARE PLAN.

676

OUR SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
ELIZABETH COHEN JOINS ME WITH

678
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
MORE.
WHAT ARE THE EXCHANGES AND HOW

679
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
DO THEY WORK?

680
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
>> AN EXCHANGE IS YOU GO ONLINE

681
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
AND YOU BUY INSURANCE BECAUSE

682
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
THE WHOLE POINT OF OBAMA CARE IS

683
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
EVERY AMERICAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE

684
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
INSURED BY THE TIME THIS IS

685
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
DONE.
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE

686
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
BASICS OF THE EXCHANGES.

687
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
IT'S FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

688
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
GETTING THEIR INSURANCE THROUGH

689
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
THEIR EMPLOYER AND THE

690
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
PROVIDERS, THE INSURERS HAVE TO

691
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
TAKE YOU.

692
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
THEY CAN'T TELL YOU NO BECAUSE

693
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
THEY HAVE A PREEXISTING

694
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
CONDITION AND CAN'T CHARGE YOU

695
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
MORE WHICH IS A HUGE CHANGE FROM

696
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
THE WAY IT IS NOW AND YOU WILL

697
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
GET A SUBSIDY TO HELP YOU BUY

698
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
THAT INSURANCE IF YOUR FAMILY

699
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
MAKES UNDER APPROXIMATELY

700
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
$92,000 FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR.

701
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
NOW YOU WERE REFERRING TO WHO IS

702
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
GOING TO RUN THESE EXCHANGES?

703
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A MAP.

704
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
THIS MAP SHOWS THE STATES IN

705
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
GREEN HAVE BASICALLY TOLD THE

706
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE WANT TO

707
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
YOU DO IT.
YOU GUYS ORGANIZE THESE AND RUN

708
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
THESE.
THE STATES IN WHITE ARE GOING TO

709
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
RUN THEIR OWN EXCHANGES ON THEIR

710
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
OWN OR THEY'VE TEAMED UP WITH

711
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
OTHER STATES.

712
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
DON?
>> ALL RIGHT, ELIZABETH COHEN,

FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE, YOU SAY

723
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
THERE ARE A FEW REASONS WHY

724
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
STATES SHOULD SET UP THE

725
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
EXCHANGES.
WHAT ARE THEY?
>> I THINK THERE ARE TWO MAIN

726
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
REASONS AND RELATE TO PROGRAMS

727
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000

733
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
INSURANCE MARKET AND THAT MEANS

734
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
SINCE THE HEALTH CARE REALLY

735
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
BECAME A BIG DEAL IN THE 1950s,

736
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
STATES HAVE PRIMARILY BEEN IN

737
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
CHARGE OF THAT MARKET.

738
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
THE EXCHANGES FIT INTO THAT

739
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
MARKET AND IF STATES MAINTAIN

740
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
CONTROL OVER THE EXCHANGES, THEY

741
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
THEN HAVE A COORDINATED

742
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
ENFORCEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION

743
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
OF LAWS ACROSS THE COMMERCIAL

744
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
MARKETPLACE.

745
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COMES

746
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
IN AND RUNS THIS PARTICULAR

747
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
PROGRAM, THEN THERE GET TO BE

748
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
COORDINATION ISSUES, TWO LEVELS

749
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
OF GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY INVOLVED

750
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
IN THE DAY-TO-DAY ACTIVITY AND

751
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
THAT'S PROBABLY NOT IN THE END

752
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
GOOD FOR THE CONSUMER.

753
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
THE SECOND REASON IS THE STATE

754
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
MEDICAID PROGRAMS, THE EXCHANGES

755
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
WORK BOTH FOR PEOPLE TO GET

756
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
COMMERCIAL TAX CREDITS IF

757
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
THEY'RE ABOVE 138% OF POVERTY

758
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
BUT LESS THAN 400% OF POVERTY

759
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
SHALL.

760
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
IF THEY'RE BELOW 138% OF

761
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
POVERTY, THEY HAVE COVERAGE

762
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM, SO

763
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
AGAIN, IF STATES ARE RUNNING THE

764
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
MEDICAID PROGRAM AND THE

765
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
EXCHANGES, THERE CAN BE A MORE

766
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
COORDINATED APPROACH AS PEOPLE
MOVE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN

767
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
THEM, IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

768
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
RUNS THE EXCHANGE AND THE STATE

769
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
RUNS THE MEDICAID PROGRAM, THEN

770
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
THERE'S AGAIN SOME HANDOFFS AND

771
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
POTENTIAL FOR THE CONSUMER TO BE

772
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
NOT AS WELL SERVED.

773
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I DO THINK THE FEDERAL

774
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
GOVERNMENT WILL DO A GOOD JOB

775
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
BUT THEY -- EXCUSE ME --

776
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
>> THAT'S ALL RIGHT YOUR PHONE

777
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
WENT OFF.

778
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
>> THEY DO HAVE A MORE DIFFICULT

779
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
TIME IF THE STATE, IF THERE'S A

780
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TWO

781
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
PROGRAMS.
>> LET ME JUMP IN HERE BECAUSE

782
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING SOUNDS

783
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
COMPLICATED.
I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE

784
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
GOING TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

785
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE AN EXPERT HERE

786
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
BUT ON TO SOMETHING THAT'S IN

787
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
MORE LAYMAN'S TERMS HERE, WHAT

788
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
ABOUT THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS

789
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
AN EXAMPLE OF THE FEDERAL

790
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
GOVERNMENT INTERFERING WITH

791
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
STATE CONTROL.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?

792
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY HEALTH

793
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
INSURANCE WORKS TODAY IT'S A

794
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
RICH MIX OF STATE AND FEDERAL

795
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
CONTROL.
WE DO LIKE THE FACT THAT UNDER

796
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
FEDERAL LAW CONSUMER PRIVACY IS

797
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
PROTECTED UNDER A LAW THAT

798
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
PASSED IN 1996.

799
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER

800
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
FEDERAL LAW THAT PASSED, ONE

801
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
THAT REQUIRES STATES TO MAKE

802
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
SURE THAT IN THE SMALL GROUP

803
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
MARKET NOBODY CAN BE EXCLUDED,

804
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
NO BUSINESS CAN BE EXCLUDED

805
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
BECAUSE THEY HAVE ONE SICK

806
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
PERSON.
NOW THAT FEDERAL REQUIREMENT IS

807
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
BEING EXTENDED TO THE INDIVIDUAL

808
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
MARKET, SO THERE ARE SOME NEW

809
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN THIS

810
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
PROGRAM BUT IT'S NOT A NEW

811
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
PRECEDENT.
TODAY THE STATE OFFICIALS WHEN I

812
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
WAS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IN

813
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
PENNSYLVANIA I ENFORCED BOTH

814
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
STATE AND FEDERAL LAW, WHAT MOST

815
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
MATTERED TO ME WAS MY ABILITY TO

816
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
ENFORCE THAT LAW TO THE BENEFIT

817
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
OF CONSUMERS ACROSS THE

818
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
COMMERCIAL MARKETPLACE, AND EVEN

819
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
THOUGH SOME OF IT WAS ENFORCED

820
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
IN FEDERAL LAW IT STILL WAS THE

821
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
DAY-TO-DAY CONTROL WAS WITH ME

822
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
EVEN THOUGH HE FEELS THAT THEY

918
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
NEED PEOPLE TO GO IN AND

919
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
CHALLENGE THEIR COSTS, HE ARGUES

920
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
THAT'S BETTER DONE OVER TIME,

921
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
NOT FORCED ON THEM BY THE FISCAL

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
CLIFF.

PENTAGON.

924
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
>> ALL RIGHT, CHRIS.
>>> ARE YOU WORRIED AIR FARES

925
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000

00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
TAKING TO THE SKIES?

927
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
WHAT A REPORT FOUND THAT JUST

928
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
MIGHT SURPRISE YOU.

929
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I had three kids.

930
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And she became the full time
mother of three.

931
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It was soccer, and ballet, and
cheerleading, and baseball.

932
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Those years were crazy.

933
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So, as we go into
this next phase,

934
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
you know, a big part
of it for us is that

935
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
there isn't anything on the
schedule.

936
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
SOME BIG CHANGES ARE COMING TO

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000

RECORD EXECUTIVE L.A. REID

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
SAYSES HE'S NOT COMING BACK FOR

940
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
ANOTHER SEASON.

941
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
A.J. HAMMER OF "SHOWBIZ TONIGHT"

942
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
IS IN NEW YORK.

943
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
>> "THE X FACTOR" HAS HAD A FEW

944
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
SHAKEUPS IN THE PAST YEAR.

945
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
JUDGE L.A. REID IS LEAVING AFTER

946
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
THE SEASON WRAPS UP.

947
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
THEY'RE IN THE SECOND SEASON.

948
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY A

949
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
SPOKESPERSON FOR EPIC RECORDS

950
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
WHERE REID IS THE CHAIRMAN AND

951
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
CEO.

952
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
WE'RE TOLD HE MADE THE DECISION

953
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
SO HE COULD CONCENTRATE ON HIS

954
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
RESPONSIBILITIES WITH THE RECORD

955
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
LABELS.

956
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
OBVIOUSLY A PRETTY BIG JOB AND

957
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
KEEPS HIM BUSY SO THE LABEL TELD

958
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
US REID REALLY NEEDS TO TURN HIS

959
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
FULL ATTENTION TO HIS DAY JOB.

960
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
NOW THE SHOW HAS SEEN QUITE A

961
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
FEW OTHER CHANGES OVER THE PAST

962
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
YEAR, SOME TURNOVER WITH BRITNEY

963
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
SPEARS AND DEMI LOVATO.

TWO NEW HOSTS, KHLOE KARDASHIAN

00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
BROADCAST AND GOOD NEWS FOR HIM

967

SEASON OF "X FACTOR" FIRING UP

POINT IT'S ANYONE'S GUESS WHO

974
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
WILL REPLACE HIM.

975
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
>> IS THE SHOW NOT DOING WELL?

976
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
WHAT IS GOING ON?

977
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
>> FROM THE BEGINNING IT NEVER

978
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
UP WITH SIMON COWELL'S

979
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
EXPECTATIONS AND WHAT HE PUT OUT

980
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
FOR THE HOPES FOR THE RATINGS

981
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
THAT THE SHOW WOULD SEE AND I

982
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
THINK L.A. REID, YOU WATCH HIM

983
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
ON THE SHOW AND SOMETIMES YOU

984
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
WONDER, DOES HE REALLY WANT TO

985
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
BE DOING THIS?

986
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
HE'S A GREAT JUDGE, I THINK HE

987
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
CALLS IT LIKE HE SEES IT BUT HE

988
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
HAS A BIG DAY JOB, RUNNING A

989
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
RECORD LABEL.

990
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
>> IT WAS INTERESTING WHEN THEY

991
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
BROUGHT HIM ON, SEEMED LIKE AN

992
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
ODD FIT.

1019
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000

00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
AIRLINE MERGER, PEOPLE THINK

1098
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
LESS COMPETITION AND HIGHER

1099
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
PRICES.

1100
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
"USA TODAY" SAYS THE DRAMATIC

1101
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
PRICE INCREASES THAT SOME PEOPLE

1102
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
EXPECTED THEY JUST HAVEN'T

1103
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
HAPPENED AND NOW YES PRICES ARE

1104
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
HIGHER.
THE THING IS NOT THAT MUCH.

1105
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
DOMESTIC TICKET PRICES HAVE BEEN

1106
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
RISING ONLY 1.8% A YEAR SO

1107
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
THAT'S LESS THAN THE RATE OF

1108
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
INFLATION.

1109
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT WHEN A

1110
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
CARRIER MOVES OUT OF THE MARKET

1111
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
ANOTHER ONE USUALLY MOVES IN,

1112
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
AND SO THAT'S MAINTAINING THE

1113
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
COMPETITION.

1114
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
DON?
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU,

1115

1117

CAN THE HUGE OFFSEASON SIGNING

1118

LEAD TO POST SEASON SUCCESS?

1119
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.

1120
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
ANNCR: Some politicians seem to
think Medicare and...

1121
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Social Security are just numbers
in a budget.

1122
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Well, we worked hard for those
benefits.

1123
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
We earned them.

1124
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And if Washington tries to cram
decisions about the future...

1125
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
of these programs into a last
minute budget deal...

1126
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
we'll all pay the price.

1127
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
AARP is fighting to protect
seniors with responsible...

1128
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
solutions that strengthen
Medicare and...

1129
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Social Security for generations
to come.

1130
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
We can do better than a last
minute deal...

1131
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
that would hurt all of us.

1132
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000

>>> NEW YORK KNICKS FANS HAVE

1133
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000

TAKING ON THE VISITING LOS

1145

THE INTERESTING POINT WAS, THE

LAKER COACH COMING BACK, THE

1147
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
COACH AGAINST THE TEAM THAT HE

1148
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
WALKED AWAY FROM IN MARCH.
THE LAKERS ARE STRUGGLING AND

1149
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
DID LAST NIGHT.

1150
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
THE MVP CANDIDATE, CARMELO

00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
OF MEANING TO IT AT THIS POINT.

1156
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I DON'T THINK -- MAYBE IF WE

1157
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
WERE ROLLING, PLAYING WELL IT

1158
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
PROBABLY HAS ADDED SIGNIFICANCE.

1159
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
BUT AT THIS POINT, YOU KNOW, I

1160
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000

TALL, DISTINGUISHED BUT MORE

1412
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
SERIOUSLY, HE DOES KNOW THE

1413
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000

HE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE

1414
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000

AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN.

1419

AND THE TIES TO MR. OBAMA GO WAY

1420
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000

YOU COULD SAY GO BACK TO THE

1421
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
2004 ELECTION WHEN SENATOR KERRY

1422
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
TOOK BARACK OBAMA ON THE MAP BY

1423
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000

THE CONVENTION.

1425
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
SO THAT'S ONE FACTOR.

1426
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I THINK YOU WOULD SAY THAT HE'S

1427
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
A VERY LIKELY CANDIDATE NOBODY

1428
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000

TROUBLE SAILING THROUGH IN THE

1430

>> AND AFTER ALL, JOHN McCAIN

1431
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
DID SAY -- DID CALL HIM AND

1432
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
JOKINGLY HE SAID, MR. SECRETARY,

1433
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
WHEN THEY WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF

A CONFERENCE RECENTLY.

1435
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000

1436
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
MAY GO THROUGH WITHOUT ANY

1437
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
PROBLEM.

1438
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000

1439
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000

1440

>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

1803
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
MORE THAN ONE-THIRD, 33%, SAID

1804
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,000
THAT INCREASING OF STORMS REALLY

1805
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
IS EVIDENCE OF THE END TIMES,

1806
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
THAT IS THE BEGINNING OF THE END

1807

1808
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:25,000
THAT'S MORE THAN 85 MILLION

1809
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
AMERICANS.
AMONG THIS GROUP, ONE REALLY

1810
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
STANDS OUT.

1811
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
THAT IS WHITE EVANGELICAL
PROTESTANTS.

1812
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000

1813
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,000
AS A MINORITY OF PROTESTANTS.

1814
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
IT'S FAR FROM BEING A FRINGE

1815
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
BELIEF IN AMERICA.

1816
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
>> HAS THERE BEEN ANY SHIFT IN

1817
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:44,000
ATTITUDES THAT IS, DO MORE

1818
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
AMERICANS BELIEVE IN A BIBLICAL

1819
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
EXPLANATION RATHER THAN JUST

1820
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
GLOBAL WARMING, SOMETHING THAT

1821
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
WE CAN FIX?
DO THEY THINK IT A BIBLICAL

1822
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
EXPLANATION?
>> WE ASKED THIS QUESTION

1823
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
SEPARATELY BECAUSE THEY TOLD US

1824
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
WHETHER IT WAS A RESULT OF

1825
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
CLIMATE CHANGE AND A RESULT OF

1826
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:02,000
THE END TIMES AND WE DID SEE

1827
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
THAT SIX IN TEN AMERICANS SAY

1828
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
THAT IT'S A RESULT OF CLIMATE
CHANGE.

1829
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
SO WE HAVE MOST AMERICANS ON
THAT SIDE.

1830
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
AGAIN, THE SIGNIFICANT MINORITY
HERE AND THE REAL QUESTION IS

1831
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
HOW MUCH DOES IT MATTER IN TERM

1832
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
OF WHAT GOVERNMENT ACTION WANTS

1833
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
TO DO AND IT TURNS OUT THAT IT

1834
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
MATTERS.
THE PERCEPTION OF THE FACTS

1835
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
MATTERS THE MOST.
SO THOSE WHO DON'T BELIEVE THAT

1836
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
STORMS ARE GETTING MORE SEVERE,

1837
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
JUST THE FACT OF THAT ARE TWICE

1838
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:27,000
AS LIKELY TO SAY THAT THE

1839
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO MORE TO
ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE BUT AMONG

1840
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
THOSE WHO SAY THAT IT'S A SIGN

1841
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
OF THE END TIMES, THEY ARE
EVENLY DIVIDED ON WHETHER OR NOT

1842
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO

1843
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THIS
COMPARED TO MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS

1844

1845

1848
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
A SPLIT IN THE RELIGIOUS

1849

1850
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
WEATHER SHIFTS ARE BIBLICAL

1851
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,000
WHILE MAINLINE PROTESTANTS AND

1852
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
CATHOLICS CLAIM CLIMATE CHANGE.

1853
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:04,000

1854

1857

CAN SEE IN THE DATA HERE AS

1858
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
HAVING THE BIBLICAL WORLD VIEW

1859
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
THAT GOD IS CONTROL OF ALL OF

1860
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
THE EVENTS IN THE WORLD AND GOD

1861
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
IS IN CONTROL OF THE WEATHER AND

1862
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
THEY HAVE THEOLOGICAL

1863
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
SIGNIFICANCE FOR THEM IN WAYS

THAT THEY DON'T EVEN FOR OTHER

>> HMM.

1866
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
OKAY.
SO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

1867
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,000
DIFFERENT BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE

1868
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
AND WHETHER IT'S BIBLICAL BUT

1869
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
SOME PEOPLE VIEW CLIMATE CHANGE

1870
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:40,000
AS BIBLICAL.
ARE THE TWO MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE?

1871
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
>> YOU KNOW, THEY ARE NOT.
THIS IS ALSO AN INTERESTING

1872
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
THING OF THE SURVEY, IS THAT WE

1873
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
HAD ABOUT A FIFTH OF

1874
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000

1875
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
BOTH, THAT THE SEVERITY OF

1876
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
STORMS IS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE

1877
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
AND IT'S ALSO DUE TO BEING IN

THESE ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE

1880

ANSWERS WHERE THEY CAN SAY,

1881
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
MAYBE GOD IS USING THE SEVERITY

1882

01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
WITH THEIR BAKER.

1977
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
>>> HOUSE SPEAKER AND PRESIDENT
OBAMA MET JUST UNDER AN HOUR

1978
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
YESTERDAY.

1979
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
THEY BOTH DESCRIBED IT AS FRANK

1980
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
WITH LINES OF COMMUNICATIONS

1981
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
STAYING OPEN.
>>> MORE THAN 86,000 CHILDREN IN

1982
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
KENTUCKY ARE LIVING WITHOUT

1983
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
THEIR PARENT.
THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE 2010

1984
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
CENSUS.

1985
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
AND THE REASON WHY MAY SHOCK

1986
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
YOU.

1987
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
EXPERTS SAY IT'S BECAUSE OF

1988
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
PRESCRIPTION DRUG OVERDOSES.

1989
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
EVERY 19 MINUTES, SOMEONE DIES

1990
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
THAT WAY HERE IN THE UNITED

1991
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
STATES.
AND WE'RE USED TO FOCUSING ON

1992
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
THE PERSON OR WHO DIES.

1993
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
BUT LOOKING DEEPER, WHAT YOU

1994
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,000
FIND ARE HIDDEN, THE VICTIMS.

1995
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
>> IF THIS TOWN COULD TALK, IT

1996
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:25,000
WOULD DESCRIBE A SIMPLE, IDEALIC

1997
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
LIFE.
IT WOULD ALSO WHISPER A SOBERING

1998
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
STORY, AN EPIDEMIC THAT IS

1999
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
TEARING APART FAMILY --

2000
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
>> I LOST MY DAD AND UNCLE TO

2001
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
DRUG ABUSE.

2002
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
>> AFTER FAMILY.

2003
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
>> I LOST BOTH MY UNCLE AND

2004
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
COUSIN AFTER TWO YEARS OF

2005
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE.

2006
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:48,000
>> AFTER FAMILY.

2007
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
>> I LOST BOTH MY MOTHER AND MY

2008
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
GRANDMOTHER TO OXYCONTIN.

2009
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,000
>> IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO HEAR
STORIES LIKE THIS ECHOING DOWN

2010
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
THE HALLWAYS EVERY DAY AT THIS

2011
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
HIGH SCHOOL IN ROCK CASTLE

2012
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
COUNTY, KENTUCKY.
>> CONSTANTLY HEARING ABOUT

2013
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
SOMEONE ELSE DYING BECAUSE OF

2014
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
SOMEONE ABUSING PRESCRIPTION

2015
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
DRUGS.
>> AVERY BRADSHAW SHOWS THIS

2016
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
STORY ALL TOO WELL.

2017
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
>> MY GRANDPA SAT ME DOWN AND

2018
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
TOLD ME THAT HE WAS GONE.

2019
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
>> WHEN AVERY WAS JUST 7, HIS

2020
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
FATHER OVERDOSED ON OXYCONTIN.

2021
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
HE SAYS HIS MOTHER WAS IN AND

2022
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
OUT OF HIS LIFE.
>> THE HARDEST PART OF GROWING

2023
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
UP WITHOUT A DAD WOULD BE NOT

2024
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
HAVING THAT MODEL FAMILY LIKE

2025
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
THAT YOU ALWAYS SEE.

2026
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:33,000
>> HE'S LUCKY ENOUGH TO LIVE

2027
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
WITH HIS GREAT GRAND PARENT.

2028
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
IN THIS TOWN, THAT MODEL FAMILY
IS BEING REDEFINED.

2029
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
>> THIS IS HAPPENING IN

2030
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
ROCKCASTLE COUNTY EVERY WEEK BUT

2031
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
IT'S HAPPENING IN EASTERN

2032
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
KENTUCKY EVERY DAY.

2033
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
IT'S LEAVING OUR COMMUNITIES IN

2034
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:54,000
SHREDS AND WE'RE LEFT BEHIND TO

2035
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,000
PICK UP THE PIECESES FROM THAT.

2036
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
>> KAREN KELLY IS THE EXECUTIVE

2037
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000

COMMITTEE FORMED TO HELP PREVENT

2039
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
OVERDOSES IN KENTUCKY.

2040
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
KENTUCKY IS THE FOURTH MOST

2041
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
MEDICATED STATE IN THE UNITED

2042
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
STATES AND IN ONE COUNTY

2043
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
ALONE --
>> HALF OF THE KIDS HAVE NO

2044
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:18,000
PARENT IN THE HOME WHATSOEVER.

2045
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
SO NOW WE'RE SEEING MANY RAISED

2046
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
BY GREAT GRAND PARENT BECAUSE

2047
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
WE'VE LOST AN ENTIRE GENERATION

2048
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND, YOU KNOW,
THE KIDS ARE REALLY THE ONES

2049
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
PAYING THE BIGGEST PRICE.

2050
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
>> IT'S STRESSFUL FOR KIDS AND

2051
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:34,000
IT'S REALLY AN EMOTIONAL THING.

2052
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000

WHAT IS THE BIGGEST STRUGGLE IN

2063
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
FIGHTING DRUG ABUSE?

2064
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000

WHO HAVE LOST CHILDREN BUT WE

2069
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
TEND TO LEAVE THE CHILDREN OUT

2070
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
OF FOCUS AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT

2071
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
IS JUST HEART-WRENCHING BECAUSE

2072
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THESE KIDS?

2073
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
HOW CAN THEY GO TO SCHOOL AND

2074
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
FOCUS ON MATH OR READING WHEN

2075
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
THEY DON'T HAVE PARENTS AT HOME?

2076
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
>> HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT, A

2077
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
DIFFERENT BATTLE COMPARED TO

2078
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
HEROIN, METH, OR ALCOHOL?

2079
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
>> WELL, BECAUSE, AS I

2080
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000

01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
IT'S JUST THAT THERE WERE

2331
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
REPORTS FOR POLICE TO COME OUT

2332
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
BECAUSE OF SOME SORT OF

2333
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,000
DISTURBANCE OR SHOOTING AT THE

2334
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
SCHOOL.

2335
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
OBVIOUSLY POLICE INVESTIGATORS,

2336
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,000
FIRE DEPARTMENT ALL RUSHING OUT

2337
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
TO THE SCHOOL AND FINDING WHAT

2338
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
THEY FOUND AND WE DON'T HAVE THE

2339
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
INFORMATION OF WHAT THEY HAVE

2340
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
FOUND YET.

2341
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
THERE ARE OTHER REPORTS

2342
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:20,000
PUBLISHED AND OTHERWISE THAT ARE

2343
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
SAYING THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

2344
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
IS ON LOCKDOWN.
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS ON

2345
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,000
LOCKDOWN RIGHT NOW.

2346
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
NEWTOWN POLICE SPOKESMAN IS

2347
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
TELLING CNN, OUR NEW YORK DESK,

2348
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
THAT POLICE AT SANDY HOOK

2349
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
ELEMENTARY RESPONDED TO THAT

2350
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
SHOOTING AND THE KIDS ARE NOT

2351
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
BEING EVACUATED.

2352
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
THE KIDS ARE NOT BEING EVACUATED

2353
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
FROM THIS SCHOOL.

2354
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:47,000
SO, AGAIN, WE ARE GETTING NEW

2355
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
INFORMATION NOW COMING IN.
THESE ARE THE FIRST PICTURES

2356
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
COMING IN FROM THE SCHOOL.

2357
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY
INJURIES.

2358
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,000
WE DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS BEHIND

2359
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
THE SHOOTING, WHAT TYPE OF GUN

2360
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:02,000
IF AT ALL, WHO THE SUSPECT WAS,

2361
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
IF IT WAS A STUDENT.

2362
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
AGAIN, WHEN WE GET REPORTS LIKE

2363
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,000
THIS, WE ALL CRINGE BECAUSE IT'S
THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO SEE

2364
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
HAPPEN AT ANY BUSINESS OR HOME

2365
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
AND ESPECIALLY AT AN ELEMENTARY

2366
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
SCHOOL WHEN WE KNOW THE AGES OF

2367
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
THE PEOPLE INVOLVED AND WE SEND

2368
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
OUR KIDS OFF TO SCHOOL EVERY

2369
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
SINGLE DAY HOPING THAT THEY WILL

2370
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
BE IN THE BEST HANDS AND THEN

2371
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
SADLY, FROM TIME TO TIME, THESE

2372
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
TERRIBLE SITUATIONS DO CROP UP.

2373
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
AGAIN, WE ARE LEARNING THAT THIS

2374
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:29,000
SCHOOL IS ON LOCKDOWN.

2375
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
CNN HAS CONFIRMED THAT THEY ARE
NOT EVACUATING THE STUDENTS FROM

2376
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,000
THE SCHOOL.
EMERGENCY PERSONNEL ARE THERE.

2377
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
OTHERS ARE STILL BEING RUSHED

2378
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
THERE.
OUR AFFILIATE ARE ON THE WAY TO

2379
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
THE SCHOOL AS WELL AS CNN CREWS

2380
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
AND PERSONNEL ON THE WAY AS

2381
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
WELL.
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA, YOU'VE

2382
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
BEEN SEEING THE MAP THERE.

2383
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
THE ONLY THING WE KNOW IS THAT

2384
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
IT IS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN PART

2385
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
OF CONNECTICUT.

2386
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:55,000
AND IF YOU GUYS -- I'M IN A

2387
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
BUBBLE BY MYSELF.

2388
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
IF YOU CAN SHOW US HOW CLOSE WE

2389
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
ARE TO A MAJOR TOWN OR CITY, TO

2390
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHERE THIS

2391
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
SCHOOL IS AND HOW MANY STUDENTS

2392
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
ARE THERE.

2393
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
AGAIN, HERE'S THE LATEST FROM

2394
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
THE WIRES.

2395
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
FROM THE CNN WIRES.

2396
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,000
AND THEY ARE SAYING CONNECTICUT

2397
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:14,000
STATE POLICE AND LOCAL

2398
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
AUTHORITIES ARE RESPONDING TO A

2399
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
SHOOTING AT THE ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL IN SOUTHWESTERN

2400
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,000
CONNECTICUT.
THE SCHOOL IS SANDY HOOK

2401
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:21,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

2402
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
IT IS ON LOCKDOWN.
THEY ARE NOT BEING EVACUATED.

2403
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,000
THAT'S ACCORDING TO A NEWTOWN

2404
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
POLICE SPOKESMAN.

2405
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:32,000
OUR WIRES ARE SAYING NEWTON BUT

2406
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
IT IS NEWTOWN.

2407
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
IT APPEARS TO NOT BE VERY CLOSE

2408
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,000
TO A CITY CENTER BECAUSE OUR

2409
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
AFFILIATES ARE TELLING US THAT

2410
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
IT'S GOING TO TAKE THEM A COUPLE

2411
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
MINUTES TO GET TO THE SCENE, 30

2412
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
MINUTES.
IF IT WAS CLOSE TO A MAJOR CITY,

2413
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
IT WOULD NOT TAKE THAT LONG TO

2414
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:52,000
GET OUT TO THIS ELEMENTARY

2415
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
SCHOOL.
AS YOU KNOW, THE MEDIA IS

2416
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
USUALLY LOCATED IN LARGER URBAN

2417
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
AREAS AND BUSINESS AREAS AND

2418
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:02,000
THIS MUST BE A SMALLER TOWN IN

2419
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
ORDER FOR -- OKAY.

2420
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,000
WE'RE TRYING TO GET SOMEONE ON

2421
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,000
THE PHONE NOW, LOU, A FORMER NEW

2422
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
YORK POLICE OFFICER.
IS LOU ON THE PHONE NOW OR ARE

2423
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:17,000
WE STILL WORKING TO GET HIM?

2424
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
SAY AGAIN?
ALMOST THERE.
OKAY.

2425
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
AS WE WORK -- LET ME KNOW IN MY

2426
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
EAR WHEN WE GET LOU.

2427
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
SO, AGAIN, THOSE ARE THE REPORTS

2428
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
THAT WE HAVE AND THIS COMES TO

2429
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
US AS WE WERE OBVIOUSLY IN THE

2430
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
MIDDLE OF OTHER NEWS ABOUT

2431
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE

2432
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,000
FISCAL CLIFF AND WHAT HAVE YOU

2433
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS

2434
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,000
DISTURBING NEWS COMES ACROSS THE

2435
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,000
WIRES AND WE HAVE TO READJUST TO

2436
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
BRING THIS TO YOU.

2437
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
LOU, I KNOW YOU VERY WELL.

2438
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
YOU HAVE KIDS.

2439
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,000
I'VE MET YOUR WIFE AND YOUR

2440
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
KIDS.

2441
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,000
WE SEND OUR KIDS OFF TO SCHOOL

2442
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,000
EVERY DAY.
THIS IS THE WORST THING, THE

2443
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
WORST NEWS THAT WE CAN GET.

2444
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
>> I'M HERE, DON.

2445
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
>> YEAH.

2446
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,000
LOU, TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS

2447
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,000
SWAYING.

2448
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,000
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE WORKING

2449
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
YOUR SOURCES.

2450
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
BUT AS I SAID, I'M NOT SURE IF

2451
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
YOU CAN HEAR ME, YOU HAVE KIDS,

2452
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
I'VE MET YOUR KIDS, I'VE MET

2453
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
YOUR WIFE.

2454
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THEM.

2455
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
YOU SEND YOUR KIDS OFF TO SCHOOL

2456
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:13,000
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GET

2457
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,000
THIS NEWS AND THIS IS THE WORST

2458
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
NEWS THAT YOU CAN GET.
>> THIS IS THE GREATEST FEAR,

2459
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
DON, YOU CAN POSSIBLY HAVE.

2460
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
IF YOU WATCH OUR CULTURE, IT

2461
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,000
SEEMS LIKE IT'S ERODING AWAY.

2462
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,000
YOU CAN'T TAKE KIDS TO THE MOVIE

2463
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:29,000
THEATER OR SHOPPINGI AT THE MAL.

2464
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
VERY INTERESTING CULTURE WE HAVE

2465
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
EVOLVED INTO.

2466
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
>> DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

2467
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,000
THIS SCHOOL DISTRICT?

2468
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
>> I'M SLIGHTLY FAMILIAR WITH IT

2469
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
BECAUSE AT ONE TIME I DID HAVE A

2470
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
RESIDENCE IN CONNECTICUT, AS YOU
ARE PROBABLY AWARE.

2471
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
I THINK THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS

2472
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
BORDERLINE ACADEMIC.

2473
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
THIS IS A GRAMMAR SCHOOL.

2474
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
IT'S AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

2475
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,000
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A HIGH

2476
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
SCHOOL WHERE THE CHILDREN HAVE

2477
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
EVOLVED A BIT MORE WHERE IF YOU

2478
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
STIMULATE THEM NEGATIVELY AS

2479
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,000
THEY DID IN COLUMBINE, YOU END

2480
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,000
UP WITH THIS GROUP THAT CARRY

2481
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
OUT THESE HEINOUS ACTS OF

2482
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
KILLING PEOPLE.

2483
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
THIS IS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

2484
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
I'M VERY CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT

2485
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,000
THIS IMPETUS WAS AT THE SCHOOL.

2486
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:18,000
IS IT IN BETWEEN TEACHERS,

2487
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
WORKPLACE VIOLENCE?
I'M INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT THE

2488
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,000
DYNAMICS IS HERE.

2489
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
>> WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S

2490
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
DISTURBING.
IT'S AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND

2491
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,000
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, I DON'T

2492
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
KNOW WHAT THE -- I'M READING

2493
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,000
HERE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW EXACTLY THEY DO

2494
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,000
IT NOW, WHAT THE MEASURES WERE,

2495
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
BUT MINE WAS K-5 AND THEN 5-8 OR

2496
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
9 WAS JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL AND

2497
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
THEN HIGH SCHOOL WAS BEYOND
THAT.

2498
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,000
SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE

2499
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
AGES, THOSE ARE KIDS ANYWHERE

2500
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
FROM 4 TO 5 YEARS OLD TO 12 OR

2501
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
13 YEARS OLD.

2502
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
THAT'S REALLY YOUNG.
>> THAT'S THE SCARY PART, THAT

2503
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
THEY WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO THAT

2504
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:57,000
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT OF LEARNING.

2505
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE RAM

2506
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
IF I KAGS OF THIS AND THEIR

2507
