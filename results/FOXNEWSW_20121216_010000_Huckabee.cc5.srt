WE KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO BE

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
HORRIBLE BUT THE EXTENT OF THE

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
DETAIL WAS CLINICAL.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
MULTIPLE GUN HOT.

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
THREE-LEN GUN SHOT WOUNDS AND

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
THOSE ARE THE FOLKS HE HAD A

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
CHANCE TO EXAMINE HIMSELF.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
HE PARTICIPATED IN 7 OF THE

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
EXAMS PERSONALLY.

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THE PAPERWORK IS COMPLETED AND

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
NOW, IT IS TIME FOR THE

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
FAMILIES TO HAVE A CHANCE TO

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000

AND MEMORIAL SERVICES AND A

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
VERY LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY FOR

THE COMMUNITY.

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
GOVERNOR.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
>> MOLLY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000

ATTEMPT TO EXPRESS OUR

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
COLLECTIVE SHOCK WHEN WE SAY

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
THE HORRIFIC SHOOTING IN THE

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
SANDY HOOKS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

99
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
IT IS IT NOT SENSE TO A

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
RATIONAL HUMAN BEING.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
THE GOVERNOR MALLOY GOT IT

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
RIGHT WHEN HE SAID ERIL

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
VISITED THE COMMUNITY.

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE MORE AS

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
A PARENT THAN A POLITICIAN AND

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
QUOTED THE BIBLE TO BRING

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
COMFORT TO THE NATION.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
CHURCHES WERE FILLED IN

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT LAST

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
NIGHT AS CANDLELIGHT VIGILS

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
WERE HELD TO GRIEVE FOR THE 27

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
INNOCENT PEOPLE KILLED AND

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
THOSE SHATTERED BY THE CRAZED

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
CARNAGE.

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
ON FRIDAY, NEAL CAVUTED ME,

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
WHERE WAS GOD IN WE HAVE

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
SYSTEMATICALLY REMOVED GOD

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
FROM OUR SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
ACCOUNT ACTIVITIES AND AT THE

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
MOMENT OF THE CALAMITY WE

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
WONDER WHERE IT WAS.

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
THE LIBERAL WAVE HAD A VIOLENT

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
AND JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
THAT IF I SAID PRAYER WAS IN

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
SCHOOL THE SHOOTING WOULD NOT

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
HAVE HAPPEN.
I SAID NOTHING OF THE SORT.

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
IT IS FAR MORE THAN PRAYER AND

128
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
BIBLE READING.

129
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
IT IS IT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
SUE A CITY SO WE HAVE NO MAJOR

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
16 OR CHRISTMAS CAROL CHURCHES

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
AND CHRISTIAN OWNED BUSINESSES

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
ARE TOLD TO SURRENDER THE

134
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
VALUES UNDER THE EDICT OF THE

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
GOVERNMENT ORDERS TO PROVIDE

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
TAX-FUNDED ABORTION PILLS .

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
WE SAY THINGS ARE SINFUL AND

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
SAY THEY ARE DISORDERS AND

139
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
SOMETIMES WE SAY THEY ARE

140
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
NORMAL AND HAVE TO ABANDON BED

141
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
ROCK MEMIORAL TRUTHS, WE WERE,

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
WHERE WAS GOD?

143
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
WHY ESCORTED HIM OUT OF OUR

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
CULTURE AND MARCHED HIM OUT OF

145
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THE PUBLIC SQUARE AND THEN

146
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
SURPRISED THAT A CULTURE

147
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
REFLECTS WHAT IT IS IT BECOME.

148
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
AS SOON AS THE TRAGEDY

149
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
UNFOLDED HE SHOWED UP.

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
IN THE LIVES OF TEACHERS WHO

151
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
PUT THEIR LIVES BETWEEN THE

152
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
GUNMEN AND THE STUDENTS AND IN

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
POLICEMEN WHO RUSH SCHOOL NOT

154
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
KNOWING IF THEY WOULD BE MET

155
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
WITH A BARAGE OF STUDENTS.

156
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
AND HUGS AND TIERCE OF PARENTS

157
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
AND TEACHERS THAT LIVED

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
THROUGH THE SLAUGHTER AND

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
OVERFLOWED CHURCH SERVICES

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
WHERE PEOPLE LIT CANDLES AND

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
PRAYED HE SHOWED UP IN THE

162
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
WHITE HOUSE WHERE THE

163
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
PRESIDENT ENVOKED HIS NAME AND

164
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
QUOTED FROM HIS BOOK THEN IN A

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
FEW DAYS, WE'LL GOD TO EXCUSE

166
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
HIMSELF.

167
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
AND ANNOUNCE IN OUR ARROGANT

168
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
PRIDE THAT WE HAVE EVOLVED

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
BEYOND NEEDING HIM AND SOMEONE

170
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WILL SUGGEST WE HAVE A LAW TO

171
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
STOP THIS.

172
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
WE DON'T HAVE TO PASS A NEW

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
ONE.

174
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
THERE IS ONE THAT WORKS IF WE

175
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
TEACH AND OBSERVE IT.

176
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
SHAW SHALT NOT KILL.

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
THERE ARE NINE OTHERS.

178
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
BUT TO TELL THEM ABOUT THAT

179
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
WOULD REQUIRE BRINGING GOD

180
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
BACK AND WE KNOW HOW

181
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
UNACCEPTABLE THAT MIGHT BE.

182
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
GERALDO RIVARY IS STANDING BY

183
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
IN NEWTOWN, BUT MORE

184
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
IMPORTANTLY GERALDO, I CAN'T

185
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
THINK OF ANY MAJOR AMERICAN

186
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
TRANNEL DEE THAT YOU HAVE NOT

187
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
SEEN UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL IN

188
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
THE LAST 40 YEARS.

189
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
HOW DOES THIS ONE COMPARE TO

190
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000

380
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
LITTLE SIDE ROAD.

381
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
AND WE WERE IMMEDIATELY

382
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
DIRECTED BY THE POLICE THAT

383
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000

385
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
AND JUST RAN IN THERE AND

386
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
STARTED TO FRANTICALLY LOOK AS

387
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
EVERYBODY WAS PACKED IN THERE.

388
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000

GOT HIM OFF OF THE GROUND AND

392
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
GAY HIM TO ME.

393
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
>> OH, I CAN'T IMAGINE CHRIS

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
TEEN AS A PARENT.

395
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
IP JUST CAN'T GET MY ARMS

396
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
AROUND THE EMOTION THAT YOU

397
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
MUST HAVE HAD WHEN YOU SAW

398
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
YOUR SON WAS OKAY.

399
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I AM ASSUMING YOU GRABBED HIM

400
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
AND HUGGED HIM ALMOST TO THE

401
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
POINT OF SQUEEZING THE AIR OUT

402
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
OF HIM.

403
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000

404
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I DONE CRY.

405
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
AND YOU KNOW, I AM OKAY.

407
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
AND I SAID OKAY.

408
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
AND PASSED HIM TO MY HUSBAND

409
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
SO HE COULD HUG HIM AND THEN

410
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
MY THOUGHTS WENT TO ONE OF MY

411
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
BEST FRIEND'S DAUGHTERS WHO I

412
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
KNEW WAS AT WORK AND I

413
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO LOOK

AND TOLD HER MANAGER ON THE

417
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
PHONE WITH HER MOTHER.

418
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000

HOW DO YOU IXPLAIN TO YOUR SON

427
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000

EXPLAIN SOMETHING SO HEINOUS

429
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
AND EVIL TO A CHILD IN A WAY

430
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
THAT MAYBE HE COULD UNDERSTAND

431
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000

DID BEFORE TAKING HIS OWN

KNOW THE POLICE ARE THROUGH

494
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
NOW.
I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE

495
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
UNDERSTAND.

496
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
WHEN THE POLICE OFFICERS FIRST

497
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
AROUND ON THE SCREEN LIKE THEY

498
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
DID IN SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

499
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY MAY

500
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
FACE.
THEY MAY FACE ONE GUN OR FIVE

501
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
GUNS OR EXPLOSIVES.

502
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
THEY RUN IN UATION WHERE THEY

00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
MAY HAVE TO MAKE A SPLIT

504
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
SECOND DECISION WHERE THEY MAY

505
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
ACT THE LIVES OF KIDS.

506
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
>> IT IS TRUE.

507
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
YOU NIVER CAN FULLY PREPARE

508
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT

509
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
THE SCENARIO IS.

510
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
WE HAVE EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS

511
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
FOR THESE SHOOTERS.

512
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
AND THIS IS WHAT THE SITUATION

513
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
WAS.

514
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
AND WE HAVE POLICE OFFICERS

515
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
AND DETECTIVES AND UNITS THAT

516
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
TRAIN FOR THIS ALL OF THE TIME

517
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
FOR THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO.

518
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
AND SO WHEN THEY TURN OUT.

519
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
THEY ESTABLISH A PERIMETER AND

520
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
SET UP A MOBILE COMMAND BASE

521
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
AND PLOY THE TROOPS AND VET

522
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
INFORMATION AS IT COMES IN.

523
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
AND THEY WILL USUALLY WORK IN

524
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
A MINIMUM OF FOUR TEEMS THAT

525
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
GO THROUGH THE DOOR AND DO A

526
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
GRID SEARCH.
AND MAYBE THEY WILL ACCESS TO

527
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
POIGNS OF THE BUILDING AND

528
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
BEING AWARE OF THE CROSS FIRE

529
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
SCENARIO TO STAY AWAY FROM

530
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
THAT.

531
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
THEY GO IN AND THEY DON'T KNOW

532
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
IF THE DOORS ARE BOOBY TRAPPED

533
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
OR IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE

534
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
SHOOTER.
AND THOSE PEOPLE MAY NOT HAVE

535
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
ALL OF THE INFORMATION.

536
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
AFTER COLUMBINE.
ONE OF THE CHANGES IN DEALING

537
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENTS, AS IN

538
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
COLUMBINE THEY WAITED A MINUTE

539
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
TO ASSESS WHAT WAS GOING O.

540
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
AND THE PROTOCALL IS YOU GO IN

541
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
AND TRY TO GET TO THE SHOOTER

542
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

543
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
AND THAT MEEPS THE FIRST GUYS

544
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
IN THERE ARE PUTTING THEIR IN

545
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
HARM'S WAYS.

546
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
A CRIME LIKE THIS IS USUAL LIE

547
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
DONE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES.

548
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO ASSESS.

549
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
YOU ASSESS ON THE RUN SO YEAH,

550
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IS ON THE

551
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
OTHER SIDE.

552
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
YOU WORK OUT A PLAN BEFORE

553
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
HAND AND YOU ARE ANALYZING

554
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
YOUR STRAT STRAT ON --

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
STRATEGY ON THE RUN.

556
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
24 HOURS PASSED BEFORE THE

557
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
BODIES WERE REMOVED AND A LOT

558
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
OF INTENSE FORENSIC WORK WAS

559
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
GOING ON.

560
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000

1002
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
99 PERCENT OF THE TIME THEY

1003

1005
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000

1006
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000

OPPORTUNITIES OF FREE WILL.

1008
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
AND THIS IS IT A CASE AND I

1009
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
SURE MENTAL ILWAS INVOLVED AND

1010
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I KNOW THE DEVIL WAS INVOLVED

1011
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
AND A CASE WHERE THEY BUSED IT

1012
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
IS IT AND THIS IS IT WHAT WE

1013
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000

1015
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
GOD CAN USE AND TAKE THAT

1016
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
WHICH WAS INTENDED FOR EVIL

1017
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000

OPPORTUNITY TO TURN EVIL TO

1030
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
GOOD.

1031
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
IS THAT IS IT AN IMPORTANT

1032
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
POINT.

00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
POEM ARE NOT SAYING IT IS IT A

1034
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
GOOD THING.
I HEARD PEOPLE TRY TO CREATE

1035
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
SELF INFLICTED JOY AND SAID

1036
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,000

ALL THIPPINGINGS WORK TOGETHER

1038
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000

1044
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
HUMAN SOUL AND THIS IS BAD.

1045
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
WE NEED TO HATE IT WE NEED TO

1046
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
HATE THAT WHICH IS EVIL.

1047
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
WE NEED TO PRAY AGAINST IT AND

1048
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
WORK AGAINST IT AND RAGE

1049
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000

1055
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
