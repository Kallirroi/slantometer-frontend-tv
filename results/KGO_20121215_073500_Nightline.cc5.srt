365
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
TYPE OF GUN THAT JUST SHOOTS

366
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

367
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I TOLD ALL OF MY STUDENTS THAT

368
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
WE HAD TO GET IN THE BATHROOM.

369
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
IT WAS ALL I COULD THINK OF.

370
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I PUT ONE OF MY STUDENTS ON TOP
OF THE TOILET.

371
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I JUST KNEW WE HAD TO GET IN

372
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
THERE.

373
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I WAS JUST TELLING THEM IT'S

374
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
GOING TO BE OKAY, YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

375
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I PULLED THE BOOKSHELF BEFORE IN

376
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
-- BEFORE I CLOSED THE DOOR IN

377
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
FRONT OF IT, SO WE WERE

378
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
COMPLETELY BARRICADED IN, TURNED

379
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
THE LIGHTS OFF.

380
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
>> DID YOU TELL THEM TO BE
QUIET?

381
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
>> OH YES.

382
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I TOLD THEM TO BE QUIET.

383
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I TOLD THEM WE HAD TO BE

384
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
ABSOLUTELY QUIET BECAUSE I WAS

385
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
JUST SO AFRAID THAT IF HE DID
COME IN AND THEN HE WOULD HEAR

386
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
US AND HE WOULD MAYBE START

387
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
SHOOTING THE DOOR.

388
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I SAID WE HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTELY

389
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
QUIET.

390
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
AND WE HAVE -- I SAID, THERE ARE

391
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
BAD GUYS OUT THERE NOW, WE NEED

392
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
TO WAIT FOR THE GOOD GUYS.

393
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I WANTED US TO BE OKAY.

394
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
AND I'M SO SADDENED THAT THERE

395
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
ARE PEOPLE IN THIS SITUATION WHO

396
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
ARE NOT OKAY.

397
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO ANYONE

398
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
WHO KNEW THEM AND WAS PART OF

399
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
THEIR LIVES.

400
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE.

401
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
>> DID THEY CRY?

402
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
>> IF THEY STARTED CRYING, I

403
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
WOULD TAKE THEIR FACE AND SAY

404
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

405
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
SHOW ME YOUR SMILE.

406
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I REALLY TRIED TO -- ONE OF MY

407
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
STUDENTS WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE I

408
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
KNOW KARATE, SO IT'S OKAY.

409
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'LL LEAD THE WAY OUT.

410
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
>> THEY SAID TO YOU WE WANT TO

411
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
GO HOME FOR CHRISTMAS.

412
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
>> OH YEAH.

413
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
OH, YEAH.

414
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
UH-HUH.

415
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
YEP.

416
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I JUST WANT TO HUG MY MOM, JUST

417
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WERE
JUST -- JUST HEARTBREAKING.

418
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
YOU KNOW?

419
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
IN MY MIND --
BECAUSE YOU'RE HEARING -- I'VE

420
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
NEVER BEEN PART OF SOMETHING

421
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
ANYWHERE NEAR THIS TRAUMATIC.

422
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
AND SO I'M HEARING THE GUNFIRE

423
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
IN THE HALLWAY.

424
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'M THINKING IN MY MIND --

425
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'M THINKING I'M THE FIRST

426
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
CLASSROOM.

427
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
WHY ISN'T HE COMING -- I'M

428
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
THINKING WE'RE NEXT.

429
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
IN MY MIND, I'M THINKING AS A

430
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
6-YEAR-OLD, 7-YEAR-OLD, WHAT ARE

431
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
YOUR THOUGHTS?

432
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'M THINKING THAT I HAVE TO

433
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
ALMOST BE THE PARENT.

434
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I HAVE TO TELL THEM -- YOU KNOW.

435
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
SO I SAID TO THEM, I NEED YOU TO

436
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU ALL VERY

437
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
MUCH.

438
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
AND THAT IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

439
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE

440
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
LAST THING THEY WERE EVER GOING

441
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
TO HEAR.

442
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL GOING TO

443
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
DIE.

444
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S

445
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
OKAY -- YOU KNOW, TEACHERS.

446
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
BUT I WANTED THEM TO KNOW

447
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
SOMEONE LOVED THEM AND I WANTED

448
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
THAT TO BE ONE OF THE LAST

449
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
THINGS THEY HEARD.

450
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
NOT THE GUNFIRE IN THE HALLWAY.

451
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
IT'S JUST SO HORRIBLE.

452
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
IT'S JUST SO HORRIBLE.

453
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE.

454
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
>> HOW DID YOU KNOW YOU WERE

455
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
GOING TO BE OKAY?

456
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
>> I DIDN'T.

457
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
WHAT FINALLY HAPPENED WAS THE

458
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
GUNFIRE STOPPED.

459
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
THE GUNFIRE WASN'T THAT LONG.

460
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
SO THAT STOPPED.

461
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
BUT I SAID WE'RE NOT GOING

462
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
ANYWHERE.

463
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
WE'RE STAYING HERE UNTIL SOMEONE

464
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
GOOD COMES IN AND GETS US OUT.

465
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
SO EVENTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED WAS

466
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
THE POLICE CAME AND STARTED

467
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
KNOCKING, AND OBVIOUSLY I WAS

468
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
COMPLETELY BESIDE MYSELF.

469
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
AND I SAID, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU,

470
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
YOU NEED TO PUT YOUR BADGES

471
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
UNDER THE DOOR.

472
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
SO THEY PUT THEIR BADGES UNDER

473
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
THE DOOR.

474
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I SAID IF YOU'RE REALLY A POLICE

475
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
OFFICER, THEN YOU WOULD HAVE A

476
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
WAY TO GET IN HERE.

477
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
YOU WOULD HAVE A KEY OR YOU --

478
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
IF EVERYTHING'S OKAY, YOU WOULD

479
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
HAVE FOUND THE KEYS.

480
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
SO HE HAD THE KEYS AND HE FOUND

481
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
THE RIGHT ONE AND HE UNLOCKED

482
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
THE DOOR AND THEN THEY BROUGHT

483
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
US OUT TO THE FIREHOUSE TO MEET

484
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
UP WITH THE REST OF THE TEACHERS

485
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
AND STUDENTS WAITING FOR PARENTS

486
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
TO COME AND PICK THEM UP.

487
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
>> I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF

488
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
PEOPLE WHO WISH THAT -- WANT ALL

489
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
THE TEACHERS TO KNOW HOW MUCH IT

490
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
MEANS TO THEM, HOW MUCH THEY

491
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
CARE ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN.

492
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
>> UH-HUH.

493
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
HOW COULD YOU NOT?

494
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
>> THANK YOU.

495
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
>> THANK YOU.

496
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
>> OUR THANKS TO DIANE, AND ONE

497
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
TEACHER'S REMARKABLE BRAVERY.

498
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
THEY WENT INTO A CORNER UNTIL

550
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
THEY WERE RECOVERED BY POLICE.

551
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
>> MY DAUGHTER'S TEACHER HEARD

552
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
SOME SHOTS AND IMMEDIATELY

553
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
LOCKED THE DOOR.

554
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
THE STATE POLICE CAME AND

555
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
KNOCKED ON THE DOOR AND TOLD

556
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
THEM IT WAS SAFE TO LEAVE.

557
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
>> Reporter: THE FACTS ARE STILL

558
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
EMERGING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

559
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
THERE WAS THIS TWEET THIS

560
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
MORNING, AN ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL

561
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
SHOT TWICE AND IN SURGERY.

562
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
AND THIS FACE TELLING IT ALL.

563
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
THIS WOMAN'S SISTER, ONE OF

564
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
THOSE TEACHERS INSIDE THE

565
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
SCHOOL, HER WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN.

566
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
>> IT DOES SOUND AS THOUGH THAT

567
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
THE TEACHERS DID EVERYTHING

568
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
HUMANLY POSSIBLE, DOWN TO

569
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
RISKING THEIR OWN LIVES, TO
PROTECT THE CHILDREN IN THIS

570
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
CONNECTICUT SCHOOL.

571
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
>> Reporter: BEING PREPARED IS

572
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
INCREASINGLY BECOMING PART OF

573
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
THE NEW MATH OF CLASSROOMS

574
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
NATIONWIDE.

PROTECT THE CHILDREN AT THE RISK

579
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
OF THEIR OWN LIFE IS SOMETHING

580
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
THAT WE SEE OCCURRING MORE AND

581
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
MORE OVER THE YEARS IN SCHOOL

582
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
SAFETY.

583
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
MASS PARENT NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS

584
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
ARE A CRITICAL PART OF SCHOOL

585
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
EMERGENCY PLANNING TODAY.

586
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
>> Reporter: IN FACT, JUST THIS

587
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
YEAR, SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

588
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
SCHOOL PUT INTO PLACE A SECURITY

589
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
PLAN, MAKING IT MANDATORY FOR

590
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
VISITORS TO RING A DOORBELL AND

591
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
ONLY BE LET IN IF STAFF

592
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
RECOGNIZED THEM THROUGH THE

593
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
VIDEO MONITOR.

594
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
AND IF STAFF DIDN'T RECOGNIZE

595
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
THE VISITOR, HE OR SHE NEEDED TO

596
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
PRESENT PICTURE I.D., SIGN IN,

597
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
AND ONLY THEN WOULD BE LET INTO

598
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
THE SCHOOL.

599
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
>> IT REALLY HAS TO BE A

600
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
COMBINATION OF NOTIFICATION,

601
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
THEN THE SCHOOL, THE TEACHERS,

602
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
THE STUDENTS, AND LAW

603
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
ENFORCEMENT HAVE TO BE VERY

604
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THEIR ROLES ARE

605
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
DURING AN ACTIVE SHOOTING.

606
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
SO THAT REALLY GOES TO TRAINING.

607
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
>> Reporter: THIS IS AT LEAST

608
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
THE 31st SCHOOL SHOOTING IN THE

609
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
UNITED STATES SINCE THE STUNNING

610
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
RAMPAGE 13 YEARS AGO AT

611
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL.

612
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
>> ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS ACROSS THE

613
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
COUNTRY HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR

614
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
LOCKDOWN DRILLS, EVACUATIONS AND

615
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
OTHER SECURITY MEASURES SINCE

616
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
COLUMBINE.

617
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TEACH

618
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
CHILDREN TO ATTACK ARMED

619
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
INTRUDERS AND THROW PENCILS AND

620
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
NOTEBOOKS, BUT WE DO EXPECT TO

621
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
HAVE SCHOOL STAFF TRAINED ON

622
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
LOCKING DOWN, ON EVACUATION

623
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
PROCEDURES, WORKING WITH LAW

624
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
ENFORCEMENT ON ACTIVE SHOOTER

625
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
DRILLS AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS

626
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
THAT ARE IMPORTANT.

627
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
>> THERE'S LITTLE DEFENSE

628
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
AGAINST SOMEONE WHO'S WILLING TO

629
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
DIE THAT ARRIVES AT A SCHOOL

630
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
WITH MULTIPLE FIREARMS, BODY

631
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
ARMOR, AND WILLING TO KILL

632
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
ANYBODY THAT GETS IN THEIR WAY.

633
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
BUT THE REAL KEY IS BECAUSE YOU

634
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
CAN'T MAYBE STOP THAT, YOU

635
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
CLEARLY CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

636
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
PEOPLE INJURED OR KILLED WITH

637
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
PROPER MOVEMENT, WHICH IS THE

638
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
RESULT OF TRAINING.

639
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
>> THERE'S NO WORDS THAT I CAN

640
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
COME UP WITH THAT WOULD EVEN

641
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
COME CLOSE TO DESCRIBING THE

642
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
SHEER TERROR OF HEARING THAT

643
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
YOUR SON IS IN A PLACE OR YOUR

644
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
CHILD IS IN A PLACE WHERE

645
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
THERE'S BEEN VIOLENCE.

646
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
YOU DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS OF

647
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
THAT VIOLENCE.

648
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
YOU DON'T KNOW THE CONDITION OF

649
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
YOUR CHILD.

650
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
AND YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO

651
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
IMMEDIATELY HELP THEM.

652
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
IT IS A POWERLESS AND TERRIFYING

653
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
EXPERIENCE.

654
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
>> Reporter: HERE AT DANBURY

655
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
HOSPITAL, WE KNOW THAT 80

656
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
DOCTORS AND NURSES WERE

657
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
ANXIOUSLY AWAITING TO TREAT AS

658
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
MANY AS TWO DOZEN WOUNDED

659
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
VICTIMS FROM TODAY'S SHOOTING.

660
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
SADLY, ONLY THREE ARRIVED, AND

661
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
EVEN MORE TRAGIC, WE NOW KNOW

662
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
TWO OF THOSE VICTIMS HAVE SINCE

663
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
DIED.

664
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
BOTH OF THEM CHILDREN.

665
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
A CRUSHING BLOW TO THIS

666
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
COMMUNITY.

667
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
CYNTHIA?

668
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
>> THANKS, AMY.

669
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
>>> NEXT UP, WHO COULD DO THIS,

670
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
AND WHY?

671
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE

672
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
20-YEAR-OLD GUNMAN BEHIND THE

673
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
TRAGEDY.

674
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
SOMETIMES LIFE CAN BE WELL,

675
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

676
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
BUT WHEN IT'S HARD OR HURTS
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,

677
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
THERE'S DULCOLAX
STOOL SOFTENER.

678
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
DULCOLAX STOOL SOFTENER
DOESN'T MAKE YOU GO,

679
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
IT JUST MAKES IT
EASIER TO GO.

680
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
DULCOLAX STOOL SOFTENER.

681
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.
