00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
FROM THE PEOPLE AT RIPLEY'S, A

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
SPOKESMAN SAYS THE COMPANY IS

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000

DECEMBER 22ND.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
BUT THIS IS A CATCH, THE OFFER

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
IS GOOD ONLY IF THE WORLD ENDS

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
ON FRIDAY 21st.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
THE SPOKESMAN SAYS VISITERS WHO

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
WALK RIGHT IN NO CHARGE.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
NO DOUBT THE BOSSES AT RIPLEY

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
HOPE THEY GET FREE PUBLICITY

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
LIKE THIS AND BRING IN NEW

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
PAYING CUSTOMERS.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
HOPEFULLY THAT WON'T WORK.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
THIS IS IT FOR "STUDIO B" TODAY.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
THE DOW IS UP IN A BIG WAY AT

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
110 POINTS.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
NEIL CAVUTO IS HERE FOR CONTEXT

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
AND I WILL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
>>Neil: REPUBLICANS PUT THE

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
BIG GUY ON THE SPOT.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
YOU DON'T GET US OFF THIS CLIFF

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
WE WILL.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
THEY PROPOSING A BACKUP PLAN

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
CANCELING TAX INCREASES DUE TO

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
HIT IN TWO WEEKS ON EVERYONE

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
EARNING LESS THAN $1 MILLION AND

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
THE SPEAKER BOEHNER SAYS HE IS

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
RAISING EVEN MORE REVENUE THAN

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
HE FIRST PROPOSED PUTTING IT NOW

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
ON THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAS TO

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
COME UP WITH SPENDING CUTS.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
FAST.
WELCOME, EVERYONE, I AM NEIL

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
CAVUTO.

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
THEY ARE GET CLOSE BUT STILL IN

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
DEAL.
REPUBLICANS WANT TO MAKE CLEAR

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
THAT IF THEY DON'T GET A DEAL IT

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
AIN'T OR FAULT.

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
THEY HIKED TAXES MORE THAN THEY

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
WANTED WAITING FOR DEMOCRATS

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
THEY SAY WHO HAVE NOT DELIVERED

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
ANY SPENDING CUTS THEY PROMISED.

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
NO WORD ON THAT.

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
TO CAPITOL HILL SENIOR PRODUCER

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
ON HOW ALL OF THIS IS GOING

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
DOWN.
THAT IS THE LATEST?

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
>>Reporter: WE ARE TOLD IN

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
THE PAST COUPLE OF MINUTES THAT

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
AN OFFICIAL TELLS ED HENRY IT IS

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
WORST IN THE PAST 24 HOURS.

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
THEY FELT THEY TOOK A STEP BACK

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
BECAUSE OF PLAN (B) THAT SPEAKER

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
BOEHNER IS PROPOSING TO THE

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
CONFERENCE MEETING IN CLOSED

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
CONFERENCE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR,

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
FOR SHOW THEM WHAT THE PLAN IS.

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
WE UNDERSTAND THEY WILL HAVE TWO

60
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
VOTES, PROBABLY THURSDAY, ONE

61
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
WOULD RENEW ALL SO-CALLED BUSH

62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
TAX CUTS FOR THOSE MAKING LESS

63
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THAN $1 MILLION A YEAR SO

64
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
REPUBLICANS CAN SAY, WELL, WE

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
DIDN'T VOTE TO RAISE TAXES.

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
THERE WILL BE A SECOND VOTE TO

67
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
RENEW ALL OF THE TAX CUTS FOR

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
THOSE MAKING LESS THAN $200,000

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
A YEAR OR COUPLES UP TO $250,000

70
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
A YEAR.
THAT IS INTERESTING HERE, THEY

71
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
ARE TRYING TO CALL THE

72
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
DEMOCRATS' BLUFF.

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER THINKS HE CAN

74
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
MUSCLE THIS THROUGH THE HOUSE

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT RAISING

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
TAXES.
THERE IS NOT A VOTE WHERE PEOPLE

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
CAN SAY YOU VOTED TO RAISE TAXES

78
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
BUT OUTSIDE GROUPS MAY NOT SEE

79
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
IT THAT WAY.

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
THEY ARE GOING TO POINT, THE

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
REPUBLICS ARE GOING TO POINT, TO

82
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
A LETTER THAT HOUSE MINORITY

83
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
LEADER NANCY PELOSI SENT TO THE

84
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
SPEAKER BACK IN MAY SAYING WE

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THINK YOU SHOULD RAISE TAXES ON

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
THOSE WHO MAKE MORE THAN $1

87
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
MILLION A YEAR FOR BRING IN MORE

88
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
REVENUE.

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
IT IS A GAME OF CHICKEN.

90
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
THEY WOULD KICK THIS OVER TO THE

91
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
SENATE.
THE PROBLEM IN THE NOT IS

92
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
McCONNELL, THE MINORITY LEADER

93
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
THERE, SAID HE WOULD TAKE A LOOK

94
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
AT THE PROPOSAL.

95
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
IN HIS REMARKS HE SAID I DON'T

96
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
WANT TO RAISE TAXES ON ANYONE

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
BUT I WANT TO PROVIDE TAX BREAKS

98
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
FOR AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.

99
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
SO THIS IS GETTING VERY SHAKY.

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
>>Neil: WE HAVE HEARD THE

101
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
WHITE HOUSE MOVE ON THEIR

102
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
FIGURES FROM $250,000 AND OVER

103
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
AFTER THE $1 MILLION OFFER BY

104
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
THE SPEAK THEY SAID $400,000.

105
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
WHAT ARE FOLKS TELLING YOU THEY

106
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
WILL LIKELY SETTLE ON UPPER

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
INCOME TAX?
>>Guest: WE HEAR THERE COULD

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
BE A THIRD VOTE, PERHAPS, ON THE

109
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
$400,000 OR SOME OTHER LEVEL

110
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS UP IN

111
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
THE AIR THAT IS FAR FROM BEING

112
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
IN CONCRETE.

113
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
THEY IS TO GET REPUBLICANS FULLY

114
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
ON BOARD.

115
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
A REPUBLICAN FRESHMAN

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
CONGRESSMAN FROM IDAHO SAYS THIS

117
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
IS A TERRIBLE IDEA FOR MULTIPLE

118
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
REASONS.
ANOTHER FROM OHIO THE MOST

119
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
CONSERVATIVE MEMBER OF THE HOUSE

120
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
OF REPRESENTATIVES SAYS I AM NOT

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
DOING CARTWHEELS OVER THIS AND

122
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO HEAR WHAT THIS

123
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
SOUNDS LIKE WHEN IT IS LAID OUT

124
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
IN THE CONFERENCE IN AN HOUR AND

125
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
START TO HEAR FROM THE LOBBY

126
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
GROUPS.

127
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
THAT IS GOING TO BE VERY TOUCHY.

128
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
SOME MEMBERS ARE NUT DANCING IN

129
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THE STREETS.

130
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
SOMETIMES THE BILLS, THE OFFERS,

131
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
WHEN YOU GET TO THE NITTY-GRITTY

132
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
HAVE TO FAIL AND MAYBE THAT HAS

133
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
TO HAPPEN.

134
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I TALKED OF THE TROUBLED ASSET

135
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
RELIEF PROGRAM IN 2008 THAT

136
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
FAILED IN THE HOUSE OF

137
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
REPRESENTATIVES, IT NEEDED TO

138
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
FAIL BEFORE IT PASSED.

139
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
>>Neil: BOTH WERE MEANT TO

140
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
PLACATE WALL STREET AFTER WALL

141
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
STREET FELL ALMOST 800 POINTS

142
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
WOULD FALL AFTER THEY APPROVED

143
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
TARP II.

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
IF WE GET UP TO CHRISTMAS

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
HOLIDAYS AND NEW YEAR HOLIDAY

146
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
ALL THE USUAL TRADERS THE NOT BE

147
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
ON WALL STREET, SO TO HAVE A

148
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
REMARKABLE MARKET FLUCTUATION

149
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
COULD BE MORE IN THE CARDS, YOU

150
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
COULD HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS

151
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
MORE ERRATIC THAN DURING THE

152
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
FAILED TARP VOTE.

153
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
SOME THINK A MARKET REACTION IS

154
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
REALLY WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN TO

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
FORCE A DEAL THE FACT THAT NO

156
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
ONE CAN MOVE AND GET TO 218

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
VOTES IN THE HOUSE OF

158
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
REPRESENTATIVES AND 51 VOTES IN

159
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
THE SENATE WITH A RADICAL MARKET

160
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
REACTION THAT GETS PEOPLES'

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
ATTENTION AND WE ARE NOT THERE

162
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
YET.
PEOPLE ARE NUT THERE.

163
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
>>Neil: THE TARGET OF TAX

164
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
HIKES COULD BE CHANGING, THE

165
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
TALK OF TAX HIKES IS NOT OF THE

166
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

167
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
YOU ARGUE, PHIL, TOO MUCH

168
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
OBSESSING HOW FAR THE TAXES GO

169
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
UP AND NOT ABOUT HOW MUCH

170
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
SPENDING GOES DOWN IF AT ALL.

171
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
>>Guest: IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS

172
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
TO ANYONE THAT STUDIES THE

173
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
MATTER, WASHINGTON HAS A

174
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
SPENDING PROBLEM.
NOT A REVENUE PROBLEM.

175
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
IF YOU LOOK AT RAIDING TAXES ON

176
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
MILLIONAIRES, PRESIDENT OBAMA

177
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
CAMPAIGNED ON INCREASING TAXES

178
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
ON THE MILLIONAIRES AND

179
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
BILLIONAIRES SO NOW IF YOU MAKE

180
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
$200,000 YOU ARE A MILLIONAIRE

181
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
OR A BILLIONAIRE.

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
EVEN IF YOU DO THAT THE REVENUE

183
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
YOU GAIN IF THAT IS NOT GOING TO

184
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
GET US OUT OF THE PROBLEMS.

185
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
SO HERE IN THE REAL WORLD THERE

186
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
IS NOT A LOT HOPE THAT ANYTHING

187
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
THAT REACHES, COMES CLOSE TO

188
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
SANITY WILL TAKE PLACE IN

189
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
WASHINGTON.

190
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
>>Neil: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF

191
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
THE VOTE AMONG THE REPUBLICAN

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
CAUCUS ON THE TAX HIKES, TO

193
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
MILLIONAIRES IN THIS CASE?

194
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
ANYONE WHO VOTES FOR THAT, DO

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
YOU REMEMBER OR DO YOU VOW

196
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
RETRIBUTION?

197
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
>>Guest: THE FEELING WITH MOST

198
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
TEA PARTY MEMBERS ACROSS

199
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
COUNTRY, THERE ARE 43 MILLION OF

200
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
US, THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT LIKE US

201
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
LESS THAN THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE

202
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
REPUBLICANS.

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WE SAY WHAT BOEHNER DID WITH THE

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
COMMITTEE CHAIRS THAT HELD FAST

205
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
TO TEA PARTY PRINCIPLES.

206
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
IN 2014, LOOK, I WAS HERE AFTER

207
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
BOEHNER WAS ELECTED SPEAKER IN

208
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
2010 WHEN THE REPUBLICANS

209
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
RETURNED TO POWER AND WE DIDN'T

210
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR THE

211
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
REPUBLICANS THEN.
THE FEELING WE HAVE IS THAT NO

212
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
ONE IS SERIOUS ABOUT CUTTING

213
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
SPENDING IN WASHINGTON, DC.

214
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
THEY MAY TRIM AROUND THE EDGES

215
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
BUT NO ONE IS SERIOUS.

216
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
YOU HAVE BERNANKE PRINTING $80

217
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
BILLION A MONTH AND IT IS PHONY.

218
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
NO ONE IS SERIOUS.

219
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
THE OTHER THING, QUICKLY, THE

220
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
NUMBER ONE RULE OF NEGOTIATING

221
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
IS DO NOT NEGOTIATE AGAINST

222
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
YOURSELF.
SPEAKER BOEHNER HAS BEEN DOING A

223
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
GREAT DEAL OF THAT.

224
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE DEMOCRATS

225
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA ARE NOT

226
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
INTERESTED IN MAKING A DEAL SO

227
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
LET THEM TAKE IT OVER THE CLIFF.

228
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
MOST MACHINES ARE PREPARED FOR

229
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THAT.
>>Neil: WE WILL SEE.

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THANK YOU, PHILIP, FROM DALLAS.

231
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
>> IF STOCKS ARE PANIC THEY HAD

232
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
A FUNNY WAY OF SHOWING IT.

233
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
THE DOW WAS IN EXCESS OF 115

234
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
POINTS, BET THAN 3 PERCENT IN

235
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
THE PAST TWO WEEKS, LARGELY ON

236
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
OPTIMISM OF A DEAL.

237
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
MY GUEST SAYS THAT IS BECAUSE

238
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
REALITY HAS YET TO SINK IN.

239
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
NOW, TODD, YOUR ARGUMENT IS

240
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
WHATEVER IS BEING CRAFTED HERE

241
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
LOOKS LIKE A BAD DEAL.

242
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
>>Guest: THAT IS RIGHT.

243
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
WALL STREET IS GIVING INVESTORS

244
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
EARLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT RIGHT

245
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
NOW.
HERE IS THE THING.

246
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
EVERYONE ON WALL STREET IS

247
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
LOOKING AT HISTORY.

248
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
WE HAVE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD

249
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
BEFORE WITH WASHINGTON.

250
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
THE NEGOTIATIONS.

251
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
THE LAST MINUTE DEALS.

252
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
EVERYONE THINKS THAT, YES, WE

253
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
WILL HAVE SOME TIME OF

254
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
RESOLUTION BEFORE YEAR END.

255
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
HOWEVER, THE SMART MONEY OUT

256
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
THERE IS PICKING UP ON THIS WE

257
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
ARE SO FAR APART, KNOWING IS

258
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
GOING TO GET ACCOMPLISHED AND

259
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
YOU WILL NEED A MIRACLE TO GET

260
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
SOMETHING DONE BY THE END OF THE

261
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
YEAR.

262
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
LOOK FOR SERIOUS VOLATILITY IN

263
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS AS WE

264
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
CLOSE THE YEAR.

265
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
>>Neil: AND THE BIG PLAYERS

266
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
LIKE YOURSELF, AND IN A CASE

267
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
WHERE A LOT OF THE BIG CHEESES

268
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
ARE NOT AROUND, YOU COULD HAVE A

269
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
BIG, BIG SWING IN ACTIVITY.

270
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
SAY THE DEAL IS SORT OF

271
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
HICCUPPING OR IT IS A BAD DEAL,

272
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
WOULD WE SEE THE SELL OFF

273
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
EXAGGERATED?

274
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
TED?

275
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
>>Guest: PARDON?

276
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
>>Neil: WOULD YOU SEE A BIG

277
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
SELL OFF IF THIS DOES NOT GO TO

278
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
WALL STREET'S LIKING OR WITH

279
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
FEWER PEOPLE ON WALL STREET THE

280
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS, IT COULD

281
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
BE EXAGGERATED.

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
>>Guest: I THINK WE SET UP.

283
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
THERE IS NO DISAPPOINTMENT IN

284
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
THIS MARKET.

285
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
IT IS A WING AND A PRAYER.

286
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THERE

287
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
WILL BE A DEAL.

288
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
SUGAR PLUMB FAIRIES AND

289
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
CHRISTMASTIME, THE MARKET IS

290
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
SETTING ITSELF UP IF AN UGLY

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
RESPONSE IF THERE IS NO DEAL OR

292
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
AS YOU SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY

293
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
YES, THERE IS A DEAL BUT IT

294
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
TURNS OUT TO BE A TROJAN HORSE

295
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
AND THAT IS A REAL POSSIBILITY.

296
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I, LIKE A LOT OF FOLKS, I AM ON

297
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
THE SIDELINES WISH WE HAD MORE

298
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
MONEY BUT YOU NEED TO

299
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
WAIT-AND-SEE.

300
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
THE MARKET IS SCARY AT THE

301
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
MOMENT.
>>Neil: IN CHICAGO THEY ARE

302
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
SAYING WE WILL GET A DEAL, NO

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
WAY THEY COULD NOT.

304
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
WHAT IF WE DON'T HAVE A DEAL?

305
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
>>Guest: WELL, WE

306
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
SIGNIFICANTLY SAW THAT IN THE

307
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
MARKET TODAY WITH THE SELL OFF

308
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
IN GOLD.

309
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
NOT ONLY DID EQUITIES RALLY BUT

310
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
GOLD SOLD OFF $30.

311
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I DISAGREE WITH TODD.

312
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THIS IS NOT WALL STREET GIVING

313
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
INVESTORS AN EARLY CHRISTMAS

314
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
PRESENT, THIS IS WALL STREET

315
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
WITH NO PRESENT TO GIVE.

316
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
THE STOCK MARKET, THE S&P IS UP

317
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
15 PERCENT SO FAR THIS YEAR AND

318
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
AS WE HAVE SEEN INVESTORS, HEDGE

319
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
FUNDS, MONEY MARKET FUNDS, THEY

320
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
ARE MAJORLY UNDERINVESTED IN THE

321
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
STOCK MARKET.

322
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
THEY HAVE MISSED THE RALLY.

323
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THEY HAVE BEEN EVERINVESTED IN

324
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
THE BOND MARKET.

325
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
THEY HAVE CATCHING UP TO DO WITH

326
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
JUST A FEW TRADING DAYS LEFT.

327
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
>>Neil: MAYBE WE ARE MAKING

328
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
TOO BIG OF A DEAL OF THE CLIFF

329
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
AND MAYBE WALL STREET IS NOT

330
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
OBSESSED.
>>Guest: IT IS TOPIC (A) AND

331
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
THE ONLY THING THAT CAN PUT THE

332
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
JOBS REPORT ON THE BACK BEENER.

333
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
HERE IS THE THING, SANDRA IS

334
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
RIGHT.
THIS IS THE BEST PLACE TO BE,

335
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
STOCKS.
BUT THERE ARE SO MANY HEADWINDS

336
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
WE ARE FACING NOT JUST THE NEXT

337
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
FEW WEEKS BUT IN 2013.

338
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
SO REGARDLESS OF A RESOLUTION OR

339
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
NOT, IF WE HAVE SOMETHING, WE

340
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT HEADWINDS

341
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
DID DEAL WITH AND THAT IS WHAT

342
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
MAKES THIS TREACHEROUS TERRITORY

343
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
GOING FORWARD, AT LEAST IN THE

344
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
IMMEDIATE FUTURE FOR STOCKS.

345
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
RIGHT NEW, IF THINGS ARE UP,

346
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS.

347
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
>>Neil: YOU SAY THEY ARE

348
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
BUILDING A HOUSE OF RISKY CARDS.

349
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
>>Guest: I THINK I HAVE TO

350
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
DISAGREE WITH SANDRA, BUT

351
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
SANDRA, I THINK ANYONE THAT HAD

352
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
ANYTHING TO DO IN THIS MARKET

353
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
HAS DONE IT.

354
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I THINK IT IS LATE FOR THE NEXT

355
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
SIX OR SEVEN TRADING DAYS TO DO

356
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
ANYTHING.
JANUARY COULD BE ANOTHER DEAL

357
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
DEPENDING ON HOW THIS CLIFF IS

358
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
RESOLVED IN A POSITIVE WAY BUT I

359
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
THINK MOST PEOPLE HAVE CLOSED

360
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
OUT THEIR YEAR.

361
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I AM NOT SURE WHAT IS DRIVING

362
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
THE TRAIN.

363
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
OBVIOUSLY UP IS BETTER THAN

364
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
DOWN, PERHAPS IT IS ALL

365
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
ANTICIPATION.
>>Neil: TWO WEEKS TO

366
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
ANTICIPATE.

367
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
AND IT ALL ENDS.

368
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
WE SHALL SEE.

369
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
FOLKS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

370
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000

AND WE CERTAINLY WILL INTERVIEW

556
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
ALL WITNESSES THAT CAN SHED ANY

557
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
LIGHT ON THIS INVESTIGATION.

558
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
CERTAINLY OUR GOAL IS TO ANSWER

559
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
EVERY QUESTION AS TO HOW AND WHY

560
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
THIS HEARTBREAKING TRAGEDY

561
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
OCCURRED.

562
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
>>Neil: THANK YOU, LIEUTENANT,

563
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
VERY MUCH.

564
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
WE CANNOT BLAME GOD FOR THE

565
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
TRAGEDIES A PRIEST AND RABBI

566
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
SAY, BUT SOMETIMES WE NEED TO

567
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE MIRROR.

568
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
>>Neil: TWO MORE YOUNG VICTIMS

569
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
WERE LAID TO REST AND SO MANY

570
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
QUESTIONS UP ANSWERED TODAY.

571
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
HOW CAN WE FIND PEACE AND KEEP

572
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
OUR FAITH AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

573
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
WE ASK A RABBI AND PASTOR, THANK

574
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
YOU BOTH FOR JOINING US.

575
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
RABBI, FIRST, A LAST FOLKS

576
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
QUESTION EVEN THE PRESENCE OF A

577
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
GOD WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS

578
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
HAPPENS.

579
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
>>Guest: IT WAS WRITTEN "A

580
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
BABY IS GOD'S OPINION THAT LIFE

581
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
SHOULD GO ON."

582
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
WHEN THIS HAPPENED, I THINK WE

583
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
ALL FELT, WHAT IS GOD'S OPINION

584
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
ABOUT 20 MURDERED BABIES?

585
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
THAT LIFE SHOULD NOT GO ON?

586
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
THAT IS WHERE FAITH BEGINS.

587
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
IT BEGINS AFTER WE HAVE BEEN

588
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
WOUNDED AND BROKEN.

589
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
IT DOESN'T BEGIN WITH SOME

590
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
ABSTRACT BELIEF.

591
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
IT BEGINS WHEN WE CLAW OUR WAY

592
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
BACK TO BELIEVING THAT THE GOOD

593
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
IN US WILL WIN.

594
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
THAT IS THE REWARD OF FAITH.

595
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
YOU MUST AT TIMES BELIEVE WHAT

596
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
YOU CAN'T SEE.

597
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
THAT PEOPLE ARE BETTER THAN THEY

598
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
SHOW.
THAT THERE IS HOPE.

599
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
THAT OUR CHILDREN WILL BE SAFE.

600
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
THE REWARD OF BELIEVING WHICH

601
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS SEE IS THAT

602
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
EVENTUALLY, YOU SEE WHAT YOU

603
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
BELIEVE.

604
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
>>Neil: FATHER, A LOT OF

605
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
PEOPLE LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN

606
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
CONNECTICUT AND SAY, I KNOW THIS

607
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
IS ALL ABOUT FREE WILL AND GOD

608
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
GRANTS US THIS ABILITY, BUT HE

609
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
IS KNOWN FOR MIRACLES NOW AND

610
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
THEN.
WHY COULDN'T HE INTERVENE HERE?

611
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
>>Guest: WELL, IT IS NOT A

612
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
QUESTION OF WHETHER HE COULD

613
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
HAVE OR NOT.
IT IS A QUESTION OF, THE MYSTERY

614
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
OF EVIL THAT WE CONFRONT AND THE

615
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
BROKENNESS OF OUR WORLD.

616
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
AS A CHRISTIAN, WE BELIEVE THAT

617
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
LOVE IS MADE MANIFEST IN

618
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
BETHLEHEM.
WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT HATRED

619
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
AND EVIL IS OFTEN MADE MANIFEST

620
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
IN CONNECTICUT.

621
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
BUT THE QUESTION, WHICH IS

622
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
STRONGER?
THE LIGHT STRONGER THAN

623
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
DARKNESS?

624
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
IS LOVE MORE POWERFUL THAN EVIL,

625
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
THAN HATE?
I BELIEVE IT IS.

626
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I BELIEVE WHEN THAT BABY IS BORN

627
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
IN BETHLEHEM, WHAT HAPPENS IS

628
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
PEOPLE TAKE INTO HIMSELF ALL OF

629
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
HUMAN SUFFERING, THE SUFFERING

630
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
IN CONNECTICUT, THE SUFFERING IN

631
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY, WHERE

632
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
EVERY MOTHER OR FATHER WHO HAS

633
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
WENT FOR A CHILD, EVERY TEAR

634
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
EVER SHED IN PUBLIC OR PRIVATE,

635
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
WILL ONE DAY BE OBLITERATED BY

636
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
THE POWER OF THAT LOVE.

637
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I AGREE WITH THE RABBI, THAT THE

638
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
HOPE THAT WE HAVE IS, IT RESTS

639
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
IN OUR FAITH AND THE ABILITY TO

640
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
REACH BEYOND WHAT WE CAN SEE OR

641
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
FEEL AT THIS MOMENT.

642
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
THERE IS NO SENSE, WE CAN MAKE

643
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
NO SENSE OUT OF THIS BECAUSE

644
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
THIS IS SENSELESS.

645
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
EVIL IS SENSELESS, IT IS

646
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
UNREASONABLE.

647
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
IT IS ANTIREASON.

648
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS REACH FOR

649
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
THE LOVE THAT COMES TO US IN THE

650
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
MEMORY OF THESE CHILDREN, THE

651
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
LOVE OF THE NATION THAT IS

652
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
POURED OUT ON THAT SMALL TOWN

653
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
RIGHT NOW.

654
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
>>Neil: IT IS HUMAN NATURE, I

655
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
GUESS, AND RABBI I DIRECT THIS

656
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
TO YOU, FOR US TO WANT TO BLAME

657
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
SOMEONE, WE CAN BLAME VIOLENT

658
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
FILMS, VIDEO, GAMES, THE N.R.A.

659
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
IS UNDER ATTACK, PUTTING OUT A

660
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
STATEMENT SAYING WE ARE MADE UP

661
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
OF FOUR MILLION MOMS AND DADS,

662
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
WE ARE SADDENED AND HEART

663
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
BROKEN, BY THE NEWS OF THE

664
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
SENSELESS MURDERS.

665
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE FAMILIES

666
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
WE HAVE GIVEN OUR TIME FOR MOURN

667
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
PRAYER AND A FULL INVESTIGATION

668
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
OF THE FACTS BEFORE COMMENTING.

669
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
WHAT DO YOU THING OF THAT?

670
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
>>Guest: WELL, IT IS A SADNESS

671
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
THAT IS DEEPLY REGRETTABLE THAT

672
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
THIS IS THEIR FIRST STATEMENT.

673
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
THEY HAVE BEEN SILENT SINCE THIS

674
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.

675
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
WHAT I BELIEVE IS THAT PART OF A

676
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
DEEP FAITH IS HAVING PATIENCE

677
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
WITH THE QUESTIONS WE ASK.

678
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
WE DO LIVE IN A SOCIETY IN WHICH

679
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
WE ARE UNNATURALLY TRAINED TO

680
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
BELIEVE THAT THE COMMERCIAL WILL

681
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
BE OVER IN 30 SECONDS, THE MOVIE

682
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
IN TWO HOURS AND THE IN DEVELOP

683
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
WILL BE WRAPPING UP LOOSE ENDS.

684
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
LIFE IS NOT LIKE THAT.

685
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
THE SOLUTIONS TO THIS TRAGEDY

686
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
ARE NOT SIMPLE.

687
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
THEY TAKE US INTO PROFOUNDLY

688
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
COMPLEX SOCIAL ISSUES.

689
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
AS WELL AS ISSUES OF FREEDOM

690
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
THAT ARE NOT WIPED AWAY BY THIS

691
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
TRAGEDY.

692
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
WHAT I BELIEVE, WE MUST AVOID

693
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE SIMPLE AND

694
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
IMMEDIATE ANSWERS TO THIS.

695
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
THIS CONVERSATION WE ARE ENGAGED

696
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
IN NOW WILL CERTAINLY RESULT, I

697
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
HELP IT WILL RESULT, IN MORE

698
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
SENSIBLE CRIMINAL OVER BOTH

699
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
AMMUNITION AND GUNS.

700
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
IT WILL RESULT, I HOPE, IN MORE

701
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
LOVING AND EXTENSIVE HELP FOR

702
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
THE MENTALLY ILL.

703
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
THAT WILL NOT END EVIL IN THE

704
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
WORD.

705
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
WHEN PEOPLE LIKE MY FRIEND BO

706
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
DIETL AND OTHERS SAY, LOOK, THE

707
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
ONLY WAY TO STOP A GUY WITH A

708
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
GUN IS WITH A GUN, WHEN THEY SAY

709
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
THAT, I BELIEVE THAT.

710
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
WHEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FOR GUN

711
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
CRIMINAL SAY, THERE ARE MORE

712
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
GUNS THAN PEOPLE IN THIS

713
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
COUNTRY, THAT HAS TO CHANGE AND

714
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SPOKE

715
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
ELOQUENTLY ABOUT THISES I

716
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
BELIEVE HIM, TOO, THESE ARE

717
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
SOCIAL ISSUES THAT CANNOT BE

718
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
PUSHED CORNERED OUR ABILITY TO

719
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
SEE THEIR IMPLICATIONS.

720
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
>>Neil: FATHERS FINALLY, WHEN

721
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
YOU TALK TO THE FLOCK, THEY ARE

722
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
GETTING INCREASINGLY SCARED

723
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
ABOUT THEIR FELLOW MAN.

724
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
THEY SEE THIS SHOOTING.

725
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
THEY SEE MALL SHOOTING A COUPLE

726
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
OF WEEKS PRIOR, AND THE SHOOT OF

727
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
IN AURORA AT A MOVIE THEATER.

728
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
THEY SEE INCREASINGLY HUMAN

729
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
BEINGS TURNING ON EACH OTHER IN

730
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
VIOLENT WAYS.

731
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
THESE COULD BE EXCEPTIONS TO THE

732
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
HUMAN RULE OF DECENCY BUT THEY

733
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
ARE MORE PUNCTUATED AND

734
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
INCREASINGLY MORE COMMON.

735
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM?

736
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
>>Guest: I SAY THAT LOVE WINS

737
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
IN THE END.

738
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
IT COULD BE WE SEE A GREAT DEAL

739
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000

AMERICAN DAD ON SUNDAY BECAUSE

935
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000

WARNING FOR VIEWERS BEFORE A

939
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
SHOW OF A SERIAL KILLER AND

940
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
HOMELAND, A SERIES OF TERRORISM

941
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
SAYING "IN LIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY

942
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
THAT HAS OCCURRED IN CONNECTICUT

943
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM CONTAINS

944
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
IMAGES THAT COULD BE DISTURBING,

945
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED."

946
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I WOULD NOT BET WE HAVE SEEN THE

947
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
LAST OF VIOLENCE ON THE SCREENS

948
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
BUT FOR NOW, IT SEEMS TO BE

949
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
HOLLYWOOD'S WAY OF PAYING

950
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
RESPECT.

951
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
>>Neil: SO, THANK YOU.

952
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
IS HOLLYWOOD GOING TOO FAR?

953
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
OR IS THERE A REAL PROBLEM WITH

954
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
THE ONSCREEN VIOLENCE?

955
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
WE ARE ASKING TO MOMS.

956
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
OVERREACTION?

957
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
>>Guest: NOTHING IS AN

958
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
OVERREACTION BUT THERE MAY NOT

959
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
BE A DIRECT CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP

960
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
BETWEEN VIOLENCE ON THE SCREEN

961
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
AND VIOLENCE COMMITTED BY PEOPLE

962
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
THAT ARE REALLY MENTALLY INSANE.

963
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
IT IS NOT AN EXCUSE.

964
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
BUT THIS MAN WAS TERRIBLY

965
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
STUBBED.
WHAT IS MORE OF A CAUSAL

966
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
RELATIONSHIP IS THE ISOLATION,

967
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
THE LACK OF ATTACHMENT, THE LACK

968
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
OF EMPATHY, THE FACT THIS CHILD

969
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
HAD NO SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS.

970
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
THAT IS MORE OF A REASON KNOW

971
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
VIOLENCE AND THE MENTAL HEALTH,

972
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
CERTAINLY, OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE.

973
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
A LOT OF BOYS TODAY USE VIDEO

974
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
GAMES AND MOVIES LIKE THAT FOR

975
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS.

976
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
THEY SLIT AND -- SIT AND DO THEM

977
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
TOGETHER AND RUN OUTSIDE AND

978
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
PLAY FOOTBALL.
>>Neil: SO THERE IS NO

979
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
CONNECTION.
I UNDERSTAND WHY THE COMPANIES

980
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
WOULD IN THIS ENVIRONMENT COOL

981
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
IT ON THE ADS BUT A LOST THEM

982
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
ARE AFRAID NECESSITY WILL BE

983
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
FORCIBLY TOLD IF YOU ARE NOT

984
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
GOING TO TAKE THE GUNS AND

985
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
VIOLENCE OUT OF THE MOVIES CAN

986
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
YOU NOT PROMOTE THE MOVIES.

987
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
>>Guest: AS A PARENT, THE TWO

988
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
YOUNG BOYS AND AS A PARENTAL

989
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
EXPERT, THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT

990
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
AS A JOB FOR US AS PARENTS TO

991
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
SEE WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE

992
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
HOMES, TO MAKE SURE OUR CHILDREN

993
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
ARE NOT PLAYING VIOLENT VIDEO

994
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
GAMES AND THEY ARE NOT WATCHING

995
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
VIOLENT VIDEOS.

996
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I HAVE A FIVE AND NINE-YEAR-OLD

997
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
AND IN MY HOME IT IT IS VERY

998
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
IMPORTANT WE ARE NOT WATCHING

999
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
THEM PLAYING VIOLENT VIDEO

1000
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
GAMES.

1001
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I WOULD BE FOR, THEY WILL NOT GO

1002
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
AWAY ENTIRELY BUT I WOULD MAKE

1003
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
IT SO THAT WE COULD PROBABLY

1004
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
TAKE IT AWAY, YES.

1005
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
>>Neil: WE TEND TO OVERREACT

1006
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS, THEN, WE GO

1007
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
WAY OVERBOARD AND IF ALL WE KNOW

1008
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
IN ADAM'S CASE WE HEARD A

1009
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
REPORTER THIS HOUR SAYING WHAT

1010
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
MIGHT HAVE SPURRED THIS RAGE WAS

1011
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
THE MOTHER THINKING ABOUT

1012
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
COMMITTING HIM, AND HE HEARD

1013
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
ABOUT IT AND SHOT HER AND WENT

1014
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
CRAZY AND SHOTS KIDS IN THE

1015
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
CHOOSE ROOM WHERE SHE

1016
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
VOLUNTEERED AND SUPPOSEDLY

1017
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
ROBBING THEM OF THIS.

1018
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
>>Guest: THAT IS ABSOLUTELY

1019
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
TRUE.
I FEEL AS THOUGH THIS MAN WAS

1020
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
VERY DISTURBED FOR VERY LONG

1021
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
PERIOD OF TIME.

1022
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
AND THE FACT THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE

1023
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
THE PROPER HELP AND THE PROPER

1024
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
MENTAL HEALTH, AND WASN'T IN AN

1025
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
ENVIRONMENT WHERE HE COULD BE

1026
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
SUPPORTED WAS THE PROBLEM.

1027
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
THE --.

1028
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
>>Neil: THEIR ARGUMENT IS WE

1029
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
ARE DESENSITIZED AS ARE THE KIDS

1030
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
BECAUSE IT IS ALL AROUND THEM

1031
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
AND MAYBE IF IT IS NOT ALL

1032
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
AROUND THEM WE WILL BE BETTER

1033
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
789 >>Guest: IT WILL BE THERE,

1034
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
REGARDLESS, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE

1035
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
PROVIDE LENGTH VIDEO GAMES AND

1036
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
VIOLENT MOVIES, IT IS A PARENTS'

1037
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
CHOICE WHAT WE EXPOSE OUR

1038
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
CHILDREN TO AND AT WHAT POINT.

1039
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
>>Neil: IS THAT YOUR CALL OR

1040
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
THE GOVERNMENT?

1041
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
>>Guest: MY CALL.

1042
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
>>Neil: DO YOU AGREE?

1043
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
>> I BELIEVE THAT PARENTS NEED

1044
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
TO KNOW THERE ARE OTHER THINGS A

1045
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
CHILD CAN DO BESIDE VIDEO GAMES

1046
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
AND THERE CAN BE A LIMIT ON THE

1047
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
AMOUNT OF TIME.

1048
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
IT IS NOT THE ONLY THING A CHILD

1049
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
DOES.

1050
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
CHILDREN NEED TO GO OUTSIDE.

1051
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
GO OUT AND PLACE.

1052
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
PARENTS NEED TO KNOW PARENTING.

1053
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
PARENTS NEED TO KNOW THEY HAVE

1054
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
TO RECOGNIZED WHEN THEIR CHILD

1055
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
IS SO DISTURBED THEY GET THE

1056
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
CHILD HELP RATHER THAN JUST

1057
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
ISOLATE THE CHILD.

1058
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
>>Guest: OR BE IN DENIAL.

1059
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
>> OR USE THIS ENTERTAINMENT AS

1060
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
A SUBSTITUTE.

1061
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
>>Guest: I FEEL AS THOUGH BY

1062
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
ISOLATING ADAM LANZA AND I AM

1063
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
NOT THEIR PSYCHIATRIST AND THERE

1064
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
IS NO JUDGMENT INTENDED, IT

1065
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
BROUGHT HIM FURTHER INTO HIS OWN

1066
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
MIND AND THAT IS WHAT MENTAL

1067
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
ILLNESS IS, PEOPLE LIVE IF THEIR

1068
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
OWN MIND.

1069
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
>>Neil: THANK YOU BOTH,

1070
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
LADIES.

1071
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
SO MUCH WE DON'T KNOW.

1072
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
TALK ABOUT VIDEOS THAT GO VIRAL

1073
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
MY CONVERSATION WITH A

1074
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
CONGRESSMAN THAT CONTINUES TO

1075
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
GENERATE CONTROVERSY, FOCUS ON

1076
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
REQUEST I WAS INTERRUPTING NOT

1077
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
AT WHAT SHE WAS TRYING TO SAY

1078
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
BUT WHY THAT CHIT CHAT PROVES WE

1079
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
COULD ALL BE IN DEEP "CHIT."

1080
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
..

1081
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
>>Neil: EVERYTHING HE SAID WAS

1082
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
TAXES, TAXES, TAXES, TAXES.

1083
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000

1084
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
LISTEN TO ME.

1085
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
YOU HAVE NOT HEARD A I SAID.

1086
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
>>Neil: WHAT WOULD YOU CUT?

1087
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
>> THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS

1088
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
WE CAN LOOK AT.

1089
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
>>Neil: YOU TOLD ME WHAT YOU

1090
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
WOULD TO DO RAISE TAXES.

1091
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
THAT IS WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

1092
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000

00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
ABOUT, YOU IS TO TALK ABOUT

1094
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
REVENUE GENERATION.

1095

>>Neil: I KNOW BUT IT IS 100

1096
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
PERCENT OF WHAT YOU ARE TALKING

1097
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
ABOUT.
>>Guest: IT AND NOT 100

00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
PERCENT OF WHAT I AM TALKING

1099
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
ABOUT.
IF YOU SHUT UP FOR A SECOND.

1100

ONE ANYONE THAT YOU SAY YOU

1102
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
WOULD CUT.

1103
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

1104
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
>>Guest: WELL I DO KNOW BUT I

1105
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
HAVE TO HAVE TIME TO EXPLAIN IT.

1106
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
>>Neil: YOU CANNOT TELL ME.

1107
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
>>Guest: IT HAS TO BE SOME

1108
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
TYPE DIALOGUE THE WE HAVE NOT

1109
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
HAD THAT.

1110
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT IS BEING

1111
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
PROPOSED SO WE CAN REACT TO IT.

1112
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
WE HAVE SAID WHAT WE ARE WILLING

1113
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
TO LOOK AT.

1114
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
>>Neil: YOU HAVEN'T, HOPE

1115
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
SPRINGS ETERNAL.

1116
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
>> I KNOW WE DEBATED.

1117
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
YOU DECIDED.
NO WONDER WE HAVE IN DEAL.

1118
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
THAT WAS THE DEMOCRATIC TEXAS

1119
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
CONGRESSWOMAN CONFIRMING WHY WE

1120
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
ARE GOING TO MAKE A DEAL, WE ARE

1121
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
GOING TO GO OVER THE FISCAL

1122
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
CLIFF.

1123
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
FROM SAID YOU BLUES FORKED, YOU

1124
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
BULLIED, I SWITCHED THE EQUAL A.

1125
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
AND ANOTHER, YOU ARE ARROGANT,

1126
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
RUDE AND A BULLY.

1127
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
ANOTHER, WHY DID YOU COME BACK

1128
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
TO APOLOGIZE IF YOUR BEHAVIOR?

1129
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
THE CONGRESSWOMAN WOULD NOT

1130
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
ANSWER DIRECTOR QUESTIONS DID

1131
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
NOT OFFER ONE PROGRAM TO CUT AND

1132
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP.

1133
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I WOULD HAVE HAD TOLD HER TO

1134
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
STICK IT WHERE THE SUN DON'T

1135
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
SHINE.

1136
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
>> AND ANOTHER SAYS THE ONLY

1137
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
THING YOU HAD TO APOLOGIZE FOR

1138
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
WAS THE VEIN POPPING OUT OF YOUR

1139
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
NECK.

1140
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I HAVE NOT SEEN YOU THIS ANGRY

1141
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
SINCE THE HOSTESS BANKRUPTCY.

1142
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
>> SHE WAS OVERTIME TOP, TALK

1143
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
ABOUT A DIMWIT.

1144
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
>> MY PROBLEM WITH THE

1145
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
CONGRESSWOMAN, LIKE MANY OF HER

1146
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
COLLEAGUES, WHEN IT COMES TO

1147
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
SPELLING OUT HOW THEY WILL

1148
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
CONTROL SPENDING THEY CAN'T AND

1149
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
THEY WON'T.

1150
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I OFFERED EVERY OPPORTUNITY I

1151
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
COULD TO STATE JUST ONE PROGRAM

1152
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
SHE WOULD CUT.

1153
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
JUST ONE.

1154
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
NOTHING.

1155
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
NOT ONE.
NOUN IS ADDRESSING THE SPENDING

1156
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
PROGRAM.

1157
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
FROM PALM BEEP, I WISH YOU CUT

1158
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
HER OFF.

1159
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
>> JOHN, SHE IS A POSTER CHILD

1160
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
OF WHAT IS WRONG WITH CONGRESS.

1161
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
>> AND ANOTHER FROM MEN

1162
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
MICHIGAN, YOU ARE MY SUPER HERO

1163
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
THE ONLY ONE WHO INSISTS THE

1164
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
QUESTIONS BE ASKED AND ANSWERED.

1165
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
>> AND ANOTHER, PLEASE STOP

1166
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
BEING SO RUDE, YOU MAKE ME

1167
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
ASHAMED TO CALL MYSELF A

1168
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
CONSERVATIVE.
>> YOU MAKE ME ASHAMED TO THINK

1169
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
AS A CONSERVATIVE YOU WOULD

1170
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
ACCEPT THE CONGRESSWOMAN'S

1171
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
CONSTANT DODGING.

1172
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
>> AND ANOTHER, FROM TED, YOU

1173
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
DESERVE A RAISE.

1174
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
SHE WAS MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE

1175
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I-MAN.
>> NO ONE IS AS DIFFICULT AS 9

1176
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
-- I-MAN.

1177
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
>> SHE IS AN IDIOT FOR

1178
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
BLATHERING BUT YOU ARE A BIGGER

1179
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
IT IDEA FOR INVITING HER.

1180
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
>> AND RIGHT AFTER THAT EXCHANGE

1181
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I HAD A DOUBLE SHOT OF SCOTCH

1182
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
AND YOU LOOK BETTER BLURRED.

1183
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
EVERYTHING DOES.
>> I CAN WELL UNDERSTAND YOU

1184
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
REACHING FOR THE BOLT BUT

1185
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
SOMETIMES WITH GUESTS LIKE THAT,

1186
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
SO DO I.

1187
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
NOT DURING THE SHOW.

1188
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
THE PROBLEM IS, WE HAVE

1189
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
POLITICIANS WHO ARE DRUNK ON

1190
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
SPENDING AND I AM SAYING,

1191
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
PERHAPS RUDELY, IS THAT THEY

1192
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
HAVE TO SOBER UP OTHERWISE THE

1193
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
COUNTRY IS GOING DOWN.
THAT DOESN'T NOON I AM SAYING WE

1194
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
SHOULD NOT SEE TAXES AT PART OF

1195
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
THE DEAL.

1196
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
AS I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES

1197
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
ELECTIONS DO HAVE CONSEQUENCES,

1198
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
AND ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF

1199
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
THIS ELECTION IS THAT VOTERS

1200
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
CLEARLY FAVORED THE RICH PAYING

1201
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
MORE TAXES.

1202
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I AM NOT FOR THAT.

1203
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
WE WILL LIKELY SEE NOTHING FROM

1204
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
THAT.

1205
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
BUT, LET'S MOVE ON AND ACCEPT

1206
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
THAT SO WE CAN DO WHICH: CUT

1207
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
SPENDING.
IT MUST BE PART OF AN OVERALL

1208
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
DEAL ADDRESSING THE PROPENSITY

1209
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
TO SPEND MORE THAN WE TAKE IN.

1210
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
THE CONGRESSWOMAN ISN'T THE

1211
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
PROBLEM.

1212
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
HER INSISTENCE THAT SPENDING

1213
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
ISN'T EVEN AN ISSUE, THAT IS THE

1214
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
PROBLEM.
I MIGHT STRIKE SOME OF YOU AS

1215
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
WEIRD AND RUDE, AND A LITTLE IN

1216
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
YOUR FACE BUT WE DON'T HAVE TIME

1217
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
FOR BLUSTER OR NONANSWERS.

1218
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
IF YOU ARE LOOK AT RACES --

1219
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
RAISING QUESTIONS, WE HAVE TO

1220
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
ADDRESS SPENDING.
WE ARE LOOKING AT 50 DEAL, AND A

1221
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
YEAR AGO THEY WERE TALKING $3 IN

1222
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
SPEND CUTS FOR $1 IN TAX HIKES.

1223
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
AND GOD KNOWS NOW WHERE IT WILL

1224
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
END.
THIS IS SOMETHING THE NEXT

1225
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
TREASURY SECRETARY WILL HAVE TO

1226
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
TAKE UP.

1227
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
WE UNDERSTAND AMERICAN EXPRESS

1228
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
C.E.O. HAS BEEN MENTIONED MORE

1229
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
PROMINENTLY AS A POSSIBILITY

1230
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
SUCCESSOR.
WE ARE WATCHING WITH MORE OF

1231
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
THIS TONIGHT.
