00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
>>> IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, A
COMMUNITY STILL STRUGGLING WITH

2
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
GRIEF AND STILL REACHING OUT TO

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
ONE ANOTHER FOR COMFORT AND

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
BEGINNING THE LONG PROCESS OF

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
SAYING GOODBYE TO SO MANY YOUNG

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
LIVES, LIVES CUT FAR TOO SHORT.

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
PEOPLE OF THIS COMMUNITY THEY

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
ARE NOT ALONE IN THEIR GRIEF AND

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
PEOPLE STOP BY TO LEAVE CANDLES

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
AND FLOWERS AND TEDDY BEARS AND

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
NOTES OF COMFORT.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
IT IS A DAUNTING CONCEPT, THE

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
IDEA OF TRYING SOMEHOW TO MOVE

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
ON WITHOUT THE 26 SIX AND

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
MOVING ON MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
FOR A VERY LONG TIME IF EVER.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
IT IS NOT CLEAR JUST WHEN THE

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
STUDENTS OF SANDY HOOK WILL

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
RETURN TO CLASS BUT WHEN THEY

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
DO, IT WILL BE IN A DIFFERENT

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
BUILDING, A DIFFERENT SCHOOL, IN

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
A NEIGHBORING TOWN.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT NOW.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
EVERYTHING.

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
JACK WAS AN AVID SPORTS FAN, NOT

BASEBALL, BASKETBALL AND SKIING

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
AND HIS FIRST LOVE WAS FOOTBALL.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
HE IDOLIZED THE NEW YORK GIANTS

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000

THAT COMMANDED THE ATTENTION IN

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
THE ROOM AND HE WANTED NOTHING

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
MORE THAN TO CATCH UP WITH HIS

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
OLDER BROTHER BEN WHOM HE WOULD

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000

SHE SURVIVED.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
NOAH DID NOT.

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
>> WE ARE ALL COMPLETELY

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
SHATTERED.

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
IT HAS BEEN A VERY, VERY ROUGH

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
FEW DAYS.

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
NOBODY IS GETTING MUCH SLEEP.

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
WE'RE HOLDING TOGETHER AS BEST

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
WE CAN.

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
YOU NEVER, EVER THINK THAT

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
TO YOUR FAMILY.

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
>> NOAH'S AUNT SAYS HE LOVED TO

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
READ AND FIGURE OUT HOW THINGS

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
WORKED.

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
SHE SAID HE WAS EXTREMELY

102
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
LIVELY, THE LIGHT OF THE ROOM.

103
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
SHE WILL REMEMBER HIS BIG BLUE

104
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
EYES, A BOY WITH A BIG HEART,

105
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000

SISTERS, AND BROTHER AND HIS

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
TWIN MOST OF ALL.

108
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
>> THEY DON'T KNOW THE WAY IN

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
WHICH NOAH PASSED AWAY, BUT

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE THERE DURING

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
THE WHOLE EVENT, AND WERE LET

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
OUT AND IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
SHE JUST TURNED SIX.

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
SHE JUST IS UNDER SIX, AND THEIR

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
OLDER SISTER SOPHIA IS NOT QUITE

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
EIGHT YET AND HOW DO YOU TELL

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
THEM THAT'S HOW THEIR BROTHER

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
DIED?
IT IS JUST THE UNTHINKABLE

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
REALLY.

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
>> IN HIS OBITUARY HIS FAMILY

SAYS HE WAS IMPISH AND LARGE OF

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
LIFE AND DEVOID OF MEANNESS.

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
THEY WROTE EVERYTHING HE DID

124
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
CONVEYED ACTION AND ENERGY

125
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
THROUGH LOVE.

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
HE WAS THE LIGHT OF OUR FAMILY.

127
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
YOU WERE LIGHT AND LOVE,

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
MISCHIEF AND FRANKS, YOU ADORED

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
YOUR FAMILY WITH EVERY FIBER OF

140
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
YOUR 6-YEAR-OLD BEING.

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
WE'RE ALL ELEVATED IN HUMANITY

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
BY HAVING KNOWN YOU, A LITTLE

143
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
MAVERICK THAT DIDN'T ALWAYS WANT

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
TO DO HIS SCHOOLWORK OR CLEAN UP

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
HIS TOYS WHEN PRACTICING HIS

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
NINJA MOVES OR SUPER MARIO ON

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THE WII SEEMED FAR MORE

148
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
IMPORTANT.

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
YOU WILL NOT PASS THROUGH THIS

150
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
WAY AGAIN.

151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I CAN ONLY BELIEVE YOU WERE

152
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
PLANTED ON EARTH TO BLOOM IN

153
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
HEAVEN.

154
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
TAKE FLIGHT, MY BOY.

155
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
SOAR.

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
THE WORDS OF A MOTHER GRIEVING

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
FOR HER LOST SON.

158
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
ONE THING THAT WE HAVE BEEN

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
DOING IS TRYING TO KEEP OUR

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
FOCUS ON THE LIVES LOST AND THE

161
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
LIVES OF THE PEOPLE HERE WHO

162
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
DIED LED, THE HEROES THAT SAVED

163
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
LIVES AND STOPPED MORE BLOODSHED

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
AND OFTEN PUT THEMSELVES IN

165
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
HARM'S WAY TO DO IT, THE

166
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
TEACHERS AND THE SCHOOL

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
ADMINISTRATORS AND WE HAVE

168
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
AVOIDED FOCUSING ON THE KILLER

169
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
BECAUSE HE HAS GONE AND FRANKLY

170
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
WE DON'T WANT HIM TO BE

171
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
REMEMBERED, CERTAINLY NOT HIS

172
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
NAME.

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
WE TRIED TO BE CAREFUL AND

174
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
RESPECTFUL OF WHAT THE FAMILIES

175
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
HERE ARE GOING THROUGH AND WE

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT.

177
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
WE TRIED NOT TO INTRUDE ON THEIR

178
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
SUFFERING.

179
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
AFTER LAST NIGHT'S PROGRAM WE

180
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
WE HAD A TECHNICAL PROBLEM WITH

189
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
IT.

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
IT RIGHT AND WE BRING YOU THE

192
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
COMPLETE INTERVIEW AND SO WE'LL

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
DO THAT TO YOU.

194
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
WE'LL BRING THAT TO YOU

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
TOMORROW.

196
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
TONIGHT WE REMEMBER ALL THE

197
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
VICTIMS AND ALSO THE HEROES OF

198
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
THIS TRAGEDY, THE TEACHERS THAT

199
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
DID SO MUCH TO PROTECT THEIR

200
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
STUDENTS AND THE FIRST

201
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
RESPONDERS.

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
HERE IS WHAT LIEUTENANT VANCE OF

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE

204
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
SAID ABOUT THE FIRST RESPONDERS.

205
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
>> THE FACULTY, STAFF IN THAT

206
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
SCHOOL DID EVERYTHING THAT THEY

207
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
POSSIBLY COULD TO PROTECT THOSE

208
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
CHILDREN.

209
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FIRST

210
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
RESPONDERS THAT GOT TO THE SCENE

211
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
ENTERED THAT SCHOOL AND SAVED

212
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
MANY HUMAN LIVES.

213
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I CAN TELL YOU IT BROKE OUR

214
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
HEARTS THAT WE COULDN'T SAVE

215
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THEM ALL.

216
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
>> LAST NIGHT'S MEMORIAL, THE

217
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
FIRST RESPONDERS GOT A STANDING

218
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
OVATION FROM A VERY GRATEFUL

219
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
COMMUNITY.

220
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
ROB AND RAY ARE FIRE FIGHTERS

221
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
WITH THE NEWTOWN HOOK AND LADDER

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
COMPANY AND JOIN ME LIVE.

223
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

224
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
HOW YOU ARE YOU HOLDING UP.

225
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
>> IT IS DIFFICULT EVERY DAY.

226
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
EVERY DAY IT IS A LITTLE BETTER,

227
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
BUT IT IS A CHALLENGE, CERTAINLY

228
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
A CHALLENGE.

229
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I KNOW

230
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
USUAL DOING IS HANDING OUT GIFTS

231
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
TO LITTLE KIDS, THINGS FROM THE

232
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
RED CROSS.
IT HAS TO BRING SOME COMFORT.

233
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
>> DEFINITELY HELPS.

234
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF STUFFED

235
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
ANIMALS AND TEDDY BEARS HAVE

236
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
BEEN STREAMING INTO THE FIRE

237
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
HOUSE AND WE'RE DOING WHAT WE

238
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
CAN TO GET IT OUT TO THE

239
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
CHILDREN IN TOWN.

240
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
>> YOU WERE BORN HERE, RIGHT.

241
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
>> YES.

242
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
>> TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THIS

243
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
COMMUNITY.

244
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I HAVE JUST BEEN STRUCK BY HOW
CLOSE KNIT IT SEEMS AND PROBABLY

245
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
NOW MORE THAN EVER.

246
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
>> THE OVER POURING OF SUPPORT

247
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
FROM PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND

248
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THE UNITY AND THE EMOTION IS

249
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
JUST OVERWHELMING.

250
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH OF THE

251
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
SUPPORT WE HAVE BEEN GETTING

252
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
FROM EVEN OUTSIDE OTHER

253
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
COMMUNITIES AND ALL AROUND THE

254
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
COUNTRY, THE PHONES RINGING OFF

255
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
THE HOOK FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO

256
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
BRING FOOD OR SUPPLIES OR

257
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
WHATEVER THEY CAN.

258
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
>> I KNOW ON THAT HORRIBLE DAY

259
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
ON FRIDAY YOU GUYS WERE ASSIGNED

260
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
TO A TRIAGE AREA.

261
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
IT DIDN'T UNFORTUNATELY END UP

262
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
BEING USED.

263
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN JUST A

264
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
SICKENING FEELING TO BE THERE AT

265
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
THIS TRIAGE UNIT AND REALIZE

266
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
THERE IS NOT PEOPLE COMING IN.

267
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
>> AT THE TIME A FEW TIMES

268
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
DURING THE INCIDENT I ACTUALLY

269
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
THOUGHT TO MYSELF SHOULD I BE

270
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
HOPING THAT THIS AREA WAS FILLED

271
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
WITH INJURED PEOPLE?

272
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I WAS ALMOST WISHING THAT IT WAS

273
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
-- THE CASE, FAIRLY EARLY ON WE

274
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO

275
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
BE THE CASE AND IT WAS BASICALLY

276
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
SET UP FOR NOTHING.

277
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
>> HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH

278
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AS A FIRST

279
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
RESPONDER?

280
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
EVERYBODY THINKS ABOUT OBVIOUSLY

281
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
THE CHILDREN AND THE TEACHERS

282
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
AND ALL OF THOSE WHO LOST THEIR

283
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
LIVES AND THE PARENTS, BUT THE

284
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
THINGS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE TO

285
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
DEAL WITH, THERE IS -- IT NEVER

286
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
LEAVES YOU.

287
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
>> NO.
NO.

288
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
>> HAVE YOU A JOB TO DO AT THE

289
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
TIME AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

290
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THINKING ABOUT AT THE TIME.

291
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
YOU REALLY DON'T THINK TOO MUCH

292
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
ABOUT THAT KIND OF STUFF UNTIL

293
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
LATER, AND EVEN NOW THERE IS

294
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
STILL A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON

295
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
AND I THINK IT WILL GET WORSE

296
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
BEFORE IT GETS BETTER.

297
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
>> YEAH.

298
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT IN THE

299
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS AND WHEN

300
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
THERE IS A LOT OF FOCUS AND

301
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
ATTENTION AND ADRENALINE GETS

302
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
YOU THROUGH, BUT IT IS OFTEN IN

303
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
THE WEEKS AFTER THAT THE PEOPLE

304
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
GO AWAY AND THE REST OF THE

305
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
WORLD KEEPS SPINNING AND RETURNS

306
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
TO SOME SEMBLANCE OF NORMAL,

307
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
THEN IT IS THIS TOWN WHICH WILL

308
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
BE LEFT WITH AN OPEN WOUND.

309
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
>> THERE IS GOING TO BE A NEW

310
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
NORMAL, I THINK.

311
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
THE OLD NORMAL A WEEK AGO IS

312
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
GONE, I BELIEVE.

313
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
>> LIVE IN COMPLACENCY ALL THESE

314
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
YEARS AND IT IS GONE.

315
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
WE'LL BE SCARRED FOREVER FROM

316
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
THIS, I THINK.

317
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
>> WE WILL RECOVER OBVIOUSLY.

318
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
LIKE ROB SAID, WE'RE WITH A

319
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
CLOSE KNIT COMMUNITY AND WE'LL

320
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
RECOVER SOMEWHAT, BUT IT IS LIKE

321
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
ROB SAID.

322
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
THE SCARS ARE NOT GOING TO GO
AWAY.

323
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
>> SCARS HEAL BUT REMAIN AND

324
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE.

325
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL YOU HAVE

326
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
DONE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

327
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
TALKING.
I WISH YOU THE BEST >> THANK

328
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
YOU.

329
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
>> WITH THE COMMUNITY REALLY

330
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
UNITED IN GRIEF, ONE PIECE OF

331
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
THE PLAN TO MOVE BEYOND THE

332
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
TRAGEDY IS TAKING SHAPE TODAY,

333
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
AND WHEN I SAY MOVE BEYOND, I

334
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE
PEOPLE WANT TO FORGET BECAUSE

335
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
THEY DON'T.

336
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THIS TOWN WILL NEVER FORGET AND

337
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
THEY JUST NEED TO TRY TO FIGURE

338
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
OUT A WAY TO CONTINUE ON AND

339
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
HONOR THE MEMORY OF THOSE WHO

340
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
THEY HAVE LOST.

341
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
HOW NEWTOWN'S NEIGHBORS ARE

I WILL SPEAK TO THOSE THAT LOST

SHOOTINGS ABOUT THEIR HEALING

347

PROCESS.

WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

THAT'S THE COLD TRUTH!

358

>>> WELL, NEWTOWN SCHOOLS WILL

359
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
REOPEN TOMORROW, BUT NOT SANDY

360
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY, OBVIOUSLY.

361
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000

SHOOTING.

365
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000

STUDENTS TO RETURN TO CLASS

367
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000

RECOUNTED THE MOMENTS AFTER THE

374
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
SHOOTING WHEN HE NEEDED TO

375
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
DELIVER TO THE PARENTS WHO WERE

376
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
WAITING FOR NEWS ABOUT THEIR

377
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
CHILDREN, WHEN HE NEEDED TO

378
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
DELIVER THE WORST POSSIBLE NEWS.

379
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
>> IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT

380
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
THERE WAS A RELUCTANCE TO TELL

381
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
PARENTS AND LOVED ONES THAT THE

382
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
PERSON THAT THEY WERE WAITING

383
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
FOR NOT GOING TO RETURN.

384
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
AND THAT HAD GONE ON FOR A

385
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
PERIOD OF TIME, WELL AFTER THERE

386
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
WAS ANY EXPECTANCY THAT FAMILIES

387
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
WOULD BE REUNITED.

388
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I MADE THE DECISION THAT TO HAVE

389
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
THAT GO ON ANY LONGER WAS WRONG.

390
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
SO I DID IT.

391
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
>> I TALKED TO LYNN McDONNELL.

392
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
KATE BALDWIN JOINS ME NOW.

393
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I TALKED TO LYNN McDONNELL

394
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
EARLIER.

395
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THE FULL

396
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
INTERVIEW TOMORROW.

397
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I TALKED TO HER AND HER HUSBAND

398
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
CHRIS ABOUT THAT WAIT.

399
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
THEY THOUGHT MAYBE THEIR LITTLE

400
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
GRACE WAS IN SOME PLACE THAT WAS

401
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
SAFE.

402
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
AND THEN SLOWLY IT BEGAN TO DAWN

403
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
ON PEOPLE THAT THAT WAS NOT THE

404
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
CASE.

405
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
SO WHAT ARE THE PLANS NOW FOR

406
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
SCHOOLS?

407
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
>> IT REALLY STARTED KICKING

408
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
INTO ACTION THE SAME DAY AS THE

409
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
HORROR WAS UNFOLDING.

410
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
NO ONE WANTS TO SEND THE

411
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
CHILDREN BACK TO SANDY HOOK

412
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
ELEMENTARY.

413
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
THEY KNOW THAT IT'S CLEARLY NOT

414
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
TIME FOR THAT.

415
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
IT'S STILL A CRIME SCENE RIGHT

416
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
NOW.

417
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
SO THEY MADE PLANS WITH THE

418
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
NEIGHBORING TOWN FOR A SCHOOL

419
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
JUST SIX MILES AWAY.

420
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
ALMOST -- IT'S VERY FORTUITOUS.

421
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
BUT THERE WAS AN EMPTY MIDDLE

422
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED BECAUSE OF

423
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
DECLINING ENROLLMENT LAST YEAR.

424
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
SO THE NEIGHBORING TOWN MONROE,

425
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE TOWN,

426
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
HE CALLED THEM RIGHT AWAY THAT

427
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
SAME DAY AND SAID IF YOU WANT

428
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
IT, IT'S YOURS.
AND SO THEY'VE BEEN WORKING

429
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
AROUND THE CLOCK.

430
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
CONTRACTORS FROM AROUND THE

431
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
REGION HAVE BEEN DONATING THEIR

432
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
TIME TO GET THIS FACILITY, IT'S

433
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
A FORMER MIDDLE SCHOOL UP TO

434
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
SNUFF AND UP TO CODE.

435
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
THEY HAVE TO CHANGE, REALLY,

436
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
EVERYTHING.

437
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
THE BONES ARE STRONG.

438
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
IT'S A SCHOOL.

439
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
BUT THEY HAVE TO LOWER

440
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
EVERYTHING.

441
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
THEY HAVE TO REPLACE TOILETS TO

442
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
BE SMALL ENOUGH FOR CHILDREN,

443
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN.

444
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
THEY HAVE TO LOWER TOWEL

445
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
DISPENSERS.

446
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
>> DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE KIDS ARE

447
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
GOING TO GO BACK?
>> THAT'S UP TO TOWN OFFICIALS.

448
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
THE MONROE TOWN OFFICIALS TOLD

449
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
ME TODAY THE BUILDING ITSELF

450
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
COULD BE READY AS EARLY AS

451
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
TOMORROW.

452
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING AROUND THE

453
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
CLOCK TO GET IT READY.

454
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
BUT WHEN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS

455
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
READY TO ASK THE CHILDREN TO

456
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
COME BACK TO SCHOOL, THAT'S UP

457
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
TO NEWTOWN SCHOOL OFFICIALS.

458
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
AND THIS FRIDAY IS SUPPOSED TO

459
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
BE THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL BEFORE

460
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
THE HOLIDAY BREAK.

461
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
SO IT COULD BE, YOU KNOW, ONLY A

462
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
DAY OR TWO THAT THEY'LL BE IN

463
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
CLASS.

464
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
BUT SOME ARE SAYING, WE ACTUALLY

465
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
TALKED ABOUT IT WITH SANJAY

466
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
EARLIER, SOME ARE SAYING THAT'S

467
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
REALLY WHAT THE KIDS NEED TO DO.

468
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
THEY NEED TO GET BACK INTO THAT

469
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
ROUTINE.

470
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
BECAUSE ONCE THEY GET INTO THAT

471
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
ROUTINE AND BACK INTO SCHOOL AND

472
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
BACK FOCUSING ON THEIR SCHOOL

473
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
AND WORK, THAT'S GOING TO HELP

474
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
THEM HEAL FASTER.

475
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
>> AND OF COURSE THERE ARE GOING

476
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
TO BE A NUMBER OF FUNERALS ALL
THIS WEEK.

477
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
>> YES.

478
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
>> WE SAW TWO TODAY.

479
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I KNOW GRACE McDONNELL, THAT THE

480
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
WAKE IS ON THURSDAY.
I THINK THE FUNERAL IS GOING TO

481
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
BE ON FRIDAY.

482
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
SO WHETHER THE KIDS ARE GOING TO

483
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
GO TO FUNERALS OBVIOUSLY, AND

484
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GOING TO NEED

485
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
TO HAVE COUNSELORS ON SCENE.

486
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
THAT FIRST DAY FOR THE KIDS COME

487
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
BACK TO THAT SCHOOL.

488
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
>> SO TOUGH.

489
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
AND I'VE BEEN TOLD THEY'RE EVEN

490
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
TALKING TO TEACHERS ABOUT HOW TO

491
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
TALK TO STUDENTS ON THE FIRST

492
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
DAY BACK.

493
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
>> SURE.

494
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
>> IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS, IF

495
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
VIOLENCE IS BROUGHT UP OR

496
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
WHATEVER QUESTIONS MAY COME UP.

497
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
YOU KNOW, CHILDREN SEE AND KNOW

498
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
MORE THAN THEY GIVE OFF, YOU

499
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
KNOW.

500
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
THEY'RE VERY PERCEPTIVE,

501
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
ESPECIALLY AT THAT AGE.

502
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

503
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
TEACHERS, AND WE SAW IT WHEN WE

504
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
WERE DRIVING AROUND.

505
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
THEY SAID THAT CHALK HILL, THAT

506
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
MIDDLE SCHOOL WHERE THE SANDY

507
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
HOOK CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE

508
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
GOING, IT WILL LIKELY BE THE

509
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
MOST SECURE SCHOOL IN THE STATE.

510
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
AND THEY'RE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT

511
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
-- THERE IS POLICE PATROL AT

512
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
EVERY SCHOOL.

513
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
THEY SAID UNFORTUNATELY THAT MAY

514
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
NOW BE THE NEW NORMAL AS THEY'RE

515
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO

516
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
AND HOW TO PROTECT THEIR KIDS.

517
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
>> KATE, I APPRECIATE THAT

518
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
THANKS FOR ALL THAT LATEST

519
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
INFORMATION.

520
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
SADLY, THIS IS NOW THE LATEST

521
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
MASS SHOOTING TO BRING THE

522
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
COUNTRY TOGETHER IN GRIEF.

523
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
AND WHILE MANY AMERICANS ARE

524
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
STILL STRUGGLING TO GRASP THE

525
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
ENORMITY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN

526
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
NEWTOWN, OTHER FAMILIES ALREADY

527
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO FACE THIS

528
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
SORT OF NIGHTMARE.

529
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
WE THOUGHT IT WORTHWHILE TO TALK

530
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

531
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
BEEN THROUGH THIS KIND OF A

532
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
TRAGEDY BEFORE.

533
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
AND SADLY, THERE ARE MANY OF

534
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
THEM.

535
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
AMARDEEP KALEKA LOST HIS FATHER

536
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
AT THE SIKH TEMPLE SHOOTING IN

537
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
OAK CREEK, WISCONSIN IN AUGUST.

538
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
WE TALKED TO AMARDEEP A LOT.

539
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
AND ROXANA GREEN LOST THEY ARE

540
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
DAUGHTER CHRISTINA TAYLOR GREEN

541
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
IN THE SHOOTING IN TUCSON,

542
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
ARIZONA, THAT ALSO INJURED GABBY

543
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
GIFFORDS NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO.

544
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
ROXANNA GREEN IS JOINING ME NOW.

545
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
AND AMARDEEP IS GOING TO BE

546
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
JOINING ME IN JUST A MOMENT.

547
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
ROXANNA, WHEN YOU HEARD THE

548
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
NEWS, WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?

549
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
IT MUST JUST ALL BRING IT BACK.

550
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
>> I WAS DEVASTATED.

551
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I WAS HEARTBROKEN FOR ALL THE

552
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
FAMILIES AND THE VICTIMS.

553
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
IT JUST BROUGHT IT ALL BACK TO

554
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
ME, AND I WAS VERY, VERY SAD.

555
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
>> LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A MIC

556
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE HAVING AN

557
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
ISSUE HERE.

558
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
HOLD ON TO IT.

559
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
THERE ARE NOW SO MANY PARENTS

560
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
WHO ARE GOING THROUGH EXACTLY

561
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH.

562
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO THEM?

563
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I MEAN, IT'S A JOURNEY THAT

564
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
DOESN'T END, THIS JOURNEY OF

565
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
GRIEF.

566
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
>> WELL, ALL I CAN SAY IS TO DIG

567
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
DEEP WITHIN YOURSELF.

568
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
AND IF YOU'RE A PERSON OF FAITH,

569
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
JUST TO PRAY REALLY HARD AND

570
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
SURROUND YOURSELF WITH LOVED

571
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
ONES OR FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

572
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
AND THINGS WILL GET BETTER IN

573
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
TIME.

574
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S A PAIN

575
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
THAT NEVER GOES AWAY.

576
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I HAVE A HOLE IN MY HEART, AND I

577
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
WILL FOREVER.

578
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
BUT I'M JUST PRAYING FOR THEM,

579
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
THEY FIND SOME KIND OF PIECE.

580
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
PEACE.

581
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
>> AND I WANT TO BRING IN

582
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
AMARDEEP.

583
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
FOR YOU, YOUR LOSS WAS MORE

584
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
RECENT.

585
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
OBVIOUSLY, WHEN YOU HEARD OF

586
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
THIS, IT MUST HAVE ALL BROUGHT

587
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
IT BACK.
>> OH MY GOD, IT WAS SHOCKING.

588
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
WHEN WE HEARD IT, WE HAD A
TODDLER RUNNING AROUND THE

589
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
HOUSE.

590
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
AND WE JUST STARED AT HIM.

591
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
MY WIFE LOOKED AT ME.

592
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
SHE WORKS IN THE SCHOOLS.

593
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I WAS A FORMER TEACHER.

594
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
SHE GOES HE WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN

595
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
RAN.
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN SHOCK.

596
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
WE STARTED CRYING.

597
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
WE COULDN'T STOP.

598
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
>> WHAT IS IT LIKE WHEN THERE IS

599
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
A LOT OF FOCUS IN THE IMMEDIATE

600
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
DAYS AFTER THIS, BUT THEN

601
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
ULTIMATELY REPORTERS GO AWAY,

602
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
AND A LOT OF THE WELL-WISHERS

603
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
AND THE COUNSELORS GO AWAY.

604
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
AND THE REST OF THE WORLD SORT

605
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
OF KEEPS SPINNING, BUT YOUR

606
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
WORLD HAS STOPPED?

607
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I MEAN YOUR WORLD HAS COMPLETELY

608
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
CHANGED FOREVER.

609
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
HOW DO YOU COPE WITH THAT TIME

610
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
WHEN THE ADRENALINE FADES AWAY

611
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
AND THE REALITY SETS IN?

612
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
>> WELL, IN MY CASE, I WROTE A

613
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
BOOK, "AS GOOD AS SHE IMAGINED."

614
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I STARTED A FOUNDATION IN MY

615
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
DAUGHTER'S NAME.

616
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
SO I'VE BEEN REALLY, REALLY BUSY

617
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
WITH THAT IT TAKES UP A LOT OF

618
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
MY TIME.

619
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
AND JUST GIVING BACK TO LESS

620
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
FORTUNATE CHILDREN IN OUR

621
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
COMMUNITY BY BUILDING

622
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
PLAYGROUNDS AND HELPING OUT THE

623
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
SCHOOLS WITH SMARTBOARDS AND

624
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
P.E. EQUIPMENT.

625
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
THAT HAS BEEN THERAPEUTIC AND

626
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
HEALING.

627
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
>> AMARDEEP, WHAT CAN COME OUT

628
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
OF THIS?

629
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
WE'VE SEEN FAR TOO MANY OF THESE

630
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
KINDS OF THINGS.

631
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I KNOW YOU WANT SOMETHING TO

632
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
CHANGE.

633
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
SOMETHING'S GOT TO CHANGE.

634
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
>> I MEAN, THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE

635
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
HAS TO START.

636
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
ROXANNA AND I WITH MAYORS

637
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
AGAINST ILLEGAL GUNS.

638
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
AND WE JUST DID A WHOLE EVENT

639
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
WITH MAYOR BLOOMBERG THIS

640
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
MORNING OR THIS AFTERNOON.

641
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
AND, I MEAN, IT'S NOT JUST THE

642
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
GUNS THAT IS THE PROBLEM,

643
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
THOUGH.

644
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
AND IT'S BECOME LIKE A DEEP DOWN

645
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
ROOTED SOCIETAL ISSUE.

646
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
AND WE NEED TO KEEP THAT

647
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
CONVERSATION GOING.

648
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
AND FOR US, WE STARTED A

649
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
DOCUMENTARY CALLED NURSERY

650
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
CRIMES.

651
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
AND WE'RE GOING OUT OF OUR WAY

652
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
TO GO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS

653
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
HAPPENING AT A YOUNGER AND

654
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
YOUNGER AGE, AND HOW WE CAN FIND

655
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALMOST AT

656
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
THIS POINT OF SOCIOPATHY AND

657
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
THEN STOP IT AND BRING THEM

658
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
BACK.

659
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
>> THERE IS ALSO OBVIOUSLY

660
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH THAT

661
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.

662
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
IS THAT A CONCERN OF YOURS AS

663
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
WELL?

664
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY.

665
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
OUR SYSTEM HAS FAILED SO MANY

666
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
YOUNG PEOPLE.

667
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK CONGRESS

668
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS TO WORK

669
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
REALLY, REALLY HARD TO COME UP

670
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
WITH A, YOU KNOW, GUN VIOLENCE

671
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
PROTECTION PLAN AND A BETTER

672
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO THESE KIND

673
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
OF SENSELESS TRAGEDIES DON'T

674
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
HAPPEN.

675
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
>> IT SEEMS LIKE SO MANY EVEN

676
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
PARENTS WHO KNOW THEIR CHILDREN

677
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
HAVE AN ISSUE, OR KNOW THEIR

678
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
YOUNG KIDS IN THEIR 20s HAVE AN

679
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
ISSUE, THEY CAN'T GET HELP

680
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
UNLESS THAT CHILD IS PROVEN TO

681
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
BE VIOLENT OR A THREAT TO

682
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
THEMSELVES OR TO OTHERS.

683
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
>> I MEAN, IT'S SAD.

684
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
MOST OF THE TIME THE CHILD

685
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
ACTUALLY HAS TO COMMIT A CRIME
BEFORE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE

686
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
TO GET HELP.

687
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
AND A LOT OF TIMES MEDICAL

688
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY THAT HEY, I

689
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
CAN'T HELP THEM UNTIL THEY DO

690
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
SOMETHING X, Y, Z BAD.

691
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
AND THAT'S A BROKEN SYSTEM.

692
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
BECAUSE WE CAN SEE YOUNGER AND

693
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
YOUNGER KIDS DOING SMALL THINGS

694
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
THAT WOULD BE SOCIOPATHIC OR

695
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
ISOLATED.

696
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
AND WE CAN GET THEM TO CONVERT

697
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
OR REVERT.

698
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
>> WHAT HAS BEEN IT BEEN LIKE

699
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
FOR YOU JUST TO WALK AROUND THIS

700
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
TOWN AND TO SEE -- TO SEE THE

701
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
OUTPOURING OF -- PEOPLE JUST

702
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
WANT TO BE HERE AND HUG ONE

703
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
ANOTHER.

704
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
>> I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY

705
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
SPECIAL.

706
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
IT'S SO HEARTBREAKING WHAT

707
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
HAPPENED HERE.

708
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
IT'S JUST DEVASTATING.

709
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
BUT TO SEE ALL THE PEOPLE COME

710
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
TOGETHER, WE JUST KNOW THAT

711
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
THERE HAS TO BE CHANGE AND HOPE

712
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
WITH THAT.

713
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
>> I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU

714
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
TALKING.

715
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
YOU WANTED TO BE HERE, TOO.

716
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
YOU WERE WALKING AROUND TO SEE

717
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
THE MEMORIALS.

718
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

719
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE ALL THE

720
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
SUPPORT IN THE COMMUNITY TO COME

721
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
OUT.

722
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
AND IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE

723
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
THINGS THAT'S -- IT'S ONE THING

724
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
WHEN YOU LOOK AT A KID THAT

725
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
FALLS VICTIM TO THIS.

726
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
THEY CAN'T VOTE.

727
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
THEY CAN'T SIGN A PETITION.

728
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
THEY CAN'T GO OUT AND RALLY.

729
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
BUT IT'S US, THE ADULTS AT THIS

730
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
POINT IN TIME.

731
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I MEAN, WE JUST SAW 20 INNOCENT

732
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
LIVES TAKEN WITH NO POINT TO IT.

733
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
IT WAS PERVERTED BEYOND BELIEF.

734
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
AND IT'S UP TO US TO PROTECT

735
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
THOSE CHILDREN AND THE CHILDREN

736
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
THAT ARE UP TO COME, YOU KNOW.

737
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
>> AMARDEEP, I APPRECIATE YOU

738
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
BEING HERE.
THANK YOU.

739
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
ROXANNA, THANK YOU.

740
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
>> THE LATEST ON THE

741
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
INVESTIGATION AS THE AUTHORITIES

742
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
LOOK AT THE KILLER'S COMPUTER.

743
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI JOINS US WITH

744
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000

>> IS THAT PRETTY MUCH ALL AT

926
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
THIS POINT?

927
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
>> YEAH.

928
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I MEAN, THEY'RE STILL LOOKING

929
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
FOR THE MOTIVE AND TRYING TO

930
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
TALK TO FAMILY, TO FRIENDS TO

931
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
TRY TO PAINT A PICTURE OF WHAT

932
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
HE WAS ALL ABOUT.

933
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
THERE IS SOME TALK FROM ONE

934
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
RELATIVE THAT NANCY LANZA --

935
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
WELL, EVERYONE DESCRIBES HER

936
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
MORE AS A GUN COLLECT EITHER
THIS POINT.

937
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING OTHER

938
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
THAN THAT, ANY PROOF OF ANYTHING

939
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
ELSE RIGHT NOW.

940
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
BUT SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE

941
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
ECONOMY, BUT THERE IS NO

942
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
EVIDENCE THAT IT WENT BEYOND

943
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
THAT, YOU KNOW.

944
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
>> RIGHT.
>> WHY SHE WAS COLLECTING THESE

945
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
GUNS.

946
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
>> RIGHT.

947
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, I APPRECIATE

948
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

949
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
LATEST ON THAT.

950
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
AFTER EVERY MASS SHOOTING, OF

951
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
COURSE, WE'RE ALL LEFT WITH THE

952
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
SAME QUESTION WHY, WHY DID THIS

953
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
HAPPEN.

954
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
WHAT LEADS SOMEONE DOWN TO GUN

955
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
DOWN COMPLETE STRANGERS?

956
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
DO THESE KILLERS HAVE ANYTHING

957
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
IN COMMON?

958
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
WHAT DOES HISTORY ACTUALLY SHOW
US?

959
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
BECAUSE WHAT IS FASCINATING IS

960
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
OFTEN WHAT WE THINK WE KNOW

961
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
ABOUT THESE SHOOTINGS, ABOUT THE

962
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
PEOPLE WHO DO THEM, IT'S

963
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
ACTUALLY VERY DIFFERENT THAN

964
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
WHAT THE REALITY IS.

965
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
AND OFTEN IT TAKES YEARS TO

966
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
LEARN THE TRUTH ABOUT THESE

967
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
PEOPLE.

968
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR.

969
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
SANJAY GUPTA JOINS ME JUST

970
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
AHEAD.

971
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
[ Male Announcer ]
RESEARCH SUGGESTS CELL HEALTH

972
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
PLAYS A KEY ROLE
THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES.

973
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
One A Day Men's 50+
IS A COMPLETE MULTIVITAMIN

974
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
DESIGNED FOR MEN'S HEALTH
CONCERNS AS WE AGE.

975
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
IT HAS 7 ANTIOXIDANTS
TO SUPPORT CELL HEALTH.

976
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
One A Day Men's 50+.

977
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
>>> IT WAS DEVASTATING TO KNOW

978
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
THAT SOMEONE HAD COME INTO THE

979
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
SCHOOL WITH A GUN.

980
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
THAT ALONE WAS HORRIBLE ENOUGH,

981
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
BECAUSE IT'S A PLACE OF PEACE

982
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
AND JOY.

983
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
BUT NOW AS WE GO FORWARD AND

984
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
WE'VE LEARNED THE NAMES, AND NOW

985
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE GRUELING

986
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
PROCESS OF THE FUNERALS, IT'S

987
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
VERY, VERY, VERY HARD.

988
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
EVERYONE USES THE WORD HOLLOW.

989
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW.

990
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
>> WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

991
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
FOCUS ON THE VICTIMS OF FRIDAY'S

992
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
SHOOTING.

993
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
WE'RE GOING BRING YOU JUST A

994
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
LITTLE BIT OF MY INTERVIEW WITH

995
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
THE McDONNELL FAMILY, WHOSE

996
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
DAUGHTER GRACE WAS KILLED ON

997
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
FRIDAY.

998
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THE WHOLE

999
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
INTERVIEW FOR YOU TOMORROW

1000
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
NIGHT.

1001
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
BUT WE'LL PLAY JUST A LITTLE BIT

1002
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
A LITTLE BIT LATER ON TO HONOR

1003
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
GRACE, AMAZING GRACE, AS WE

1004
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
TALKED ABOUT IN THE INTERVIEW.

1005
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
BUT THERE ARE MANY UNANSWERED

1006
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
QUESTIONS THAT INVOLVES THIS

1007
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
KILLER.

1008
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
WHY TARGET AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

1009
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
WHY THIS SCHOOL?

1010
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
WHY DID HE MURDER 20 FIRST

1011
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
GRADERS, LITTLE KIDS JUST 6 AND

1012
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
7 YEARS OLD, YOUNG ENOUGH TO

1013
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS AND THE

1014
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
TOOTH FAIRY.

1015
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
AS WE SAID EARLIER TODAY,

1016
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
AUTHORITIES ARE EXAMINING A

1017
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
COMPUTER SMASHED IN THE GUNMAN'S

1018
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
HOME.

1019
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI SPOKE ABOUT

1020
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
THAT.

1021
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT CONTAIN SOME
CLUES.

1022
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
INVESTIGATORS MAY NEVER FIGURE

1023
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

1024
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
SADLY, THOUGH, THERE IS A BODY

1025
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
OF RESEARCH ON THESE KIND OF

1026
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
KILLERS, ON MASS MURDERERS, AND

1027
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
THE COMMON GROUND THEY MAY

1028
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
SHARE.

1029
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
DR. SANJAY GUPTA JOINS ME.

1030
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
HE HAS BEEN LOOKING INTO THAT.

1031
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
YOU'VE BEEN RESEARCHING

1032
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
COMMONALITIES.

1033
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
WHAT ARE THEY?

1034
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND?

1035
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
>> ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT

1036
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
THESE MEDICAL INVESTIGATORS,
FORENSIC INVESTIGATORS WILL DO

1037
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
IS TRY AND FIGURE OUTDO THEY FIT

1038
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
A PARTICULAR TYPE.

1039
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
AND THEY ALMOST ALWAYS DO, WHICH

1040
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
IS INTERESTING.

1041
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
THERE ARE TYPICALLY THREE TYPES

1042
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

1043
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY HAS

1044
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
PSYCHOTIC TENDENCIES, SOMEONE

1045
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
WHO HAS PSYCHOPATHIC TENDENCIES,

1046
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
OR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN HEAVILY

1047
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
TRAUMATIZED IN YOUTH.

1048
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
JARED LOUGHNER, FOR EXAMPLE,

1049
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
SOMEBODY WE REPORTED ON QUITE A

1050
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
BIT.

1051
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
HE CLEARLY HAD PSYCHOTIC

1052
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
TENDENCIES.

1053
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
AND ONE OF THE COLUMBINE KILLERS

1054
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
HAD CLEAR CLUES DATING BACK OF

1055
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
PSYCHOPATHIC TENDENCIES.

1056
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
HE HAD SADISTIC BEHAVIOR.

1057
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
HE HAD BEEN DELINQUENT WITH HIS

1058
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
PARENTS QUITE A BIT.

1059
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER

1060
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
THIS, ANDERSON, BUT HE WAS

1061
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
LAUGHING AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS

1062
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
ACTUALLY COMMITTING THESE
MURDERS AT COLUMBINE HIGH

1063
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
SCHOOL.

1064
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
THE POINT IS THAT HARDLY ANYONE

1065
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
EVER REALLY JUST SNAPS.

1066
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT
IN THESE SITUATIONS.

1067
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
BUT THE REAL POINT HERE IS THAT

1068
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
WERE THERE SOME CLUES?

1069
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
AND THERE ALMOST ALWAYS IS.

1070
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
>> THAT NOTION OF JUST SNAPPING,

1071
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
THAT DOESN'T REALLY TURN OUT TO

1072
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
BE THE CASE, THAT USUALLY THERE

1073
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
ARE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY --

1074
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
SOMETIMES I'VE HEARD -- THERE

1075
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
WAS A SECRET SERVICE REPORT DONE

1076
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
THAT THEY ACTUALLY TALKED TO

1077
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
OTHER KIDS, OTHER PEOPLE WHAT

1078
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
THEY'RE GOING TO DO.

1079
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
>> AND IF THEY DO THAT, A VERY

1080
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
IMPORTANT POINT, IF THEY

1081
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
ACTUALLY TALK TO SOMEONE AS

1082
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
OPPOSED TO BEING ISOLATED, IT IS

1083
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
A GREAT INHIBITOR OF CARRYING

1084
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
OUT THE ACTIVITY.

1085
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
ONCE YOU START TO TALK TO OTHER

1086
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
PEOPLE, EITHER BECAUSE THEY TALK

1087
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
YOU OUT OF IT, OR YOU YOURSELF

1088
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
GET SOME GREATER CONTEXT OF WHAT

1089
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
IT IS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT
ALMOST ALWAYS INHIBITS THE

1090
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
ACTIVITY.

1091
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH A

1092
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
LOVED ONE AND OTHER PEOPLE IN

1093
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
THE SCHOOL.

1094
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
COLUMBINE WAS UNUSUAL THAT WAY

1095
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
BECAUSE THERE WAS TWO PEOPLE

1096
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
TOGETHER.

1097
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
BUT ALMOST ALWAYS IT IS A SINGLE

1098
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
PERSON WHO HAS NOT DISCUSSED

1099
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
THIS PLAN WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

1100
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
>> YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE

1101
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

1102
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
ARE A LOT OF THEM ON MEDICATION,

1103
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
OFF MEDICATION?

1104
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
>> THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING.

1105
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
ALMOST ALL OF THEM WERE ON SOME

1106
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
TYPE OF MEDICATION.

1107
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
AND IF YOU DIG A LITTLE BIT DEEP

1108
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
WITH THAT, WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT

1109
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
THERE IS A VULNERABLE PERIOD.

1110
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
IT IS WHEN SOMEONE IS STARTING

1111
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
MEDICATIONS OR WHEN THEY'RE

1112
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
GOING OFF.

1113
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
AND TYPICALLY THEY'RE

1114
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
ANTIDEPRESSANTS.

1115
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
NOT ALL PSYCHOTROPIC

1116
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
MEDICATIONS.

1117
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
AT THAT POINT WHEN THEY'RE

1118
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
EITHER GOING ON OR GOING OFF,

1119
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
THEY CAN BE A GREAT BENEFIT, BUT

1120
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
YOU CAN HAVE INCREASED

1121
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
IMPULSIVENESS, DECREASED

1122
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
JUDGMENT AND LOSS OF TOUCH WITH

1123
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
REALITY.

1124
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
THOSE ARE THE THREE SYMPTOMS

1125
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
THAT THEY DESCRIBED TO ME.

1126
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
AND REMEMBER, ANDERSON, THEY
SHOULD BE MONITORED AT THAT

1127
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
TIME.
BUT IN A MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM

1128
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
THE WAY IT IS NOW, THEY GET THE

1129
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
PRESCRIPTION, AND HARDLY ANY

1130
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
FOLLOW-UP.

1131
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
>> DOCTORS HAVE TOLD ME THAT IF

1132
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
YOU ARE ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND

1133
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
YOU JUST STOP, THAT YOU SHOULD

1134
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
NOT JUST STOP.

1135
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
YOU REALLY NEED TO BE UNDER

1136
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
SUPERVISION AND TAPER OFF.

1137
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1138
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
>> AND IT SEEMS LIKE SOME OF

1139
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
THESE PEOPLE DIDN'T.

1140
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
>> NO.

1141
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
AND YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE

1142
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
MONITORING NOTION INVOLVES

1143
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
BUILDING TRUST WITH A

1144
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
PSYCHIATRIST, BEING ABLE TO CALL

1145
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
THAT PERSON, NOT SIMPLY GETTING

1146
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
A PRESCRIPTION.

1147
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
AND, YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T TO

1148
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
INDICT THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

1149
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
BUT IT'S BASICALLY SAYING THERE

1150
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
IS NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES.

1151
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
THEY CAN BARELY SEE THE PEOPLE

1152
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
THAT THEY NEED TO SEE.

1153
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
THIS IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO

1154
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
MONITOR THEM, AGAIN, AT THESE
VULNERABLE PERIODS, IT'S NOT

1155
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
HAPPENING.

1156
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I TALKED TO SEVERAL OF THEM.

1157
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
THIS IS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING

1158
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
FOR THEM.

1159
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
>> ALSO OVER THE YEARS THERE HAS

1160
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE

1161
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
RIGHTS OF THE PATIENT,

1162
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
UNDERSTANDABLY, BECAUSE THERE

1163
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
WERE ABUSES BEFORE.

1164
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I GUESS I WONDER, HAS IT GONE

1165
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
TOO FAR?

1166
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'VE HEARD FROM PARENTS WHO SAY

1167
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TROUBLES

1168
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
WITH A CHILD OR WITH EVEN AN

1169
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
ADULT CHILD, BUT THEY CAN'T DO

1170
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
SOMETHING UNLESS THAT PERSON HAS

1171
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
COMMITTED A CRIME OR IS PROVEN

1172
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
TO BE DANGEROUS.

1173
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1174
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
IMMINENT THREAT TO THEMSELVES OR

1175
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
TO OTHERS.

1176
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
WHAT AN UNBELIEVABLE STANDARD.

1177
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
THINK ABOUT IT.

1178
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
IT'S LIKE SAYING YOU WOULD HAVE

1179
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
TO BE HAVING A HEART ATTACK TO

1180
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
BE TREATED FOR YOUR HEART

1181
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
DISEASE.

1182
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

1183
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING WE

1184
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
THINK OF AS DOCTORS.

1185
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
THE OTHER OPTION IS BASICALLY TO

1186
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
PUT THEM INTO THE CRIMINAL

1187
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

1188
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
AND NOW YOU'RE ASKING PARENTS TO

1189
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
ESSENTIALLY CREATE A POLICE

1190
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
RECORD FOR YOUR CHILD.

1191
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
>> AND FRANKLY, THAT IS THE

1192
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
REALITY THAT IS HAPPENING.

1193
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I MEAN, OUR PRISONS ARE FULL OF

1194
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL ISSUES.

1195
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1196
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
PEOPLE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THIS

1197
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
NOTION THAT FAMILIES ARE DENYING

1198
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
THE SYMPTOMS, IGNORING THEM.

1199
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
THAT COULD BE HAPPENING, BUT THE

1200
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
PEOPLE I TALK TO, THAT'S NOT THE

1201
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
CASE.

1202
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
THESE FAMILIES, THEY ANGUISH

1203
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
OVER WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH

1204
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
THEIR CHILDREN.

1205
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD OPTIONS.

1206
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
EVEN IF THEY GET THE MEDS, THEY

1207
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
ARE TO BE MONITORED, ESPECIALLY

1208
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
WHEN GOING ON AND OFF.

1209
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
AND THEY DON'T GET THAT.

1210
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
THERE ARE SO MANY POTENTIAL

1211
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
BREAKDOWNS IN THE SYSTEM.

1212
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
THESE ARE FIXABLE PROBLEMS.
BUT IT'S NOT WORKING THE WAY IT.

1213
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
>> AND THERE JUST NEEDS TO BE A

1214
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
WILL AND A CONTINUED DISCUSSION.

1215
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
OFTEN WE DISCUSS THESE THINGS IN

1216
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
THE MEDIA IN THE WAKE OF

1217
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND STOP,

1218
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
AND NOTHING EVER CHANGES.

1219
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
SANJAY, I APPRECIATE THE REPORT.

1220
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT MASS

1221
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
SHOOTERS ARE LONER THAT IS SNAP

1222
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
AND GO ON KILLING SPREES.

1223
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
IN HER BOOK "RAMPAGE: THE SOCIAL

1224
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
ROOTS OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS,"

1225
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
KATHERINE NEWMAN SAYS IT'S NOT

1226
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
THAT SIMPLE, NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

1227
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
SHE HAS DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH

1228
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
ON SCHOOL SHOOTINGS.

1229
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING BACK ON

1230
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
THE PROGRAM.

1231
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
YOU'VE STUDIED RAMPAGE SHOOTINGS

1232
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
LIKE THE ONE DATING BACK TO THE

1233
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
1970s.

1234
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
YOU SAY THERE ARE A LOT OF MYTHS

1235
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
ABOUT THEM.

1236
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
TALK TO ME ABOUT SOME OF THE

1237
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
MYTHS.

1238
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
>> ONE OF THE MYTHS IS THE IDEA

1239
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
THAT PEOPLE SNAP.

1240
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
BUT WE FOUND THAT SOMETIMES THEY

1241
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
PLAN THESE THINGS AS MUCH AS

1242
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
NINE MONTHS IN ADVANCE.

1243
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
ANOTHER MYTH IS THAT THEY ARE

1244
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
LONERS.

1245
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
THEY'RE VERY RARELY LONERS, BUT

1246
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT OF

1247
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
TROUBLE IN THEIR SOCIAL
INTERACTIONS THERE IS FRICTION

1248
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
ALL AROUND THEM.

1249
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I HAVE TO SAY CONTRARY TO WHAT

1250
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT, IN

1251
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
THE CASE OF THE SHOOTERS WE

1252
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
LOOKED AT, THEY WERE ALMOST

1253
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
NEVER DIAGNOSED OR UNDER

1254
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
TREATMENT.

1255
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
AND SO THEY'RE OFTEN PEOPLE WHO

1256
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
ARE COMPLETELY MISSED BY THE

1257
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

1258
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
AND WE FIND OUT ABOUT THEIR

1259
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
MENTAL DISORDERS IN FORENSIC

1260
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
SEGMENTS AFTER THE FACT.

1261
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
WE ALSO DISCOVER THAT THEY TELL

1262
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
PEOPLE A LOT ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE

1263
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
PLANNING TO DO, BUT THEY DO SO

1264
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
IN A WAY THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT

1265
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
TO INTERPRET.

1266
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
THEY SAY THINGS THAT ARE RATHER

1267
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
VEILED AND CONFUSING.

1268
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
AND BECAUSE WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO

1269
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
IS SO OUTLANDISH AND SO

1270
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
INCONCEIVABLE, THE PEOPLE AROUND

1271
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
THEM DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO

1272
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
INTERPRET WHAT THEY'VE HEARD.

1273
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
SO THEY GET A LOT OF INFORMATION

1274
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
CIRCULATING, BUT THAT DOESN'T
COME TO THE ADULTS WHO MIGHT BE

1275
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
ABLE TO INTERVENE BECAUSE THE

1276
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
KIDS HAVE A HARD TIME

1277
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
INTERPRETING EXACTLY WHAT THOSE

1278
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
VEILED WARNINGS MEAN.

1279
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
>> I MEAN, WE SEEM TO SEE MOSTLY

1280
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
MALES, YOUNG MALES COMMITTING

1281
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
THESE HORRIBLE CRIMES.

1282
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
IS THERE -- IS THERE A REASON

1283
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
WHY THAT IS?

1284
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
>> WELL, GIRLS DO OTHER THINGS,

1285
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT ARE

1286
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
DAMAGING TO THEMSELVES.

1287
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
BUT THEY TEND TO BE TURNING

1288
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
INWARD, WHERE AS BOYS TEND TO BE

1289
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
EXPLODING OUTWARD.

1290
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
AND THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE

1291
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
IMAGES THAT THEY RECEIVE IN

1292
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
POPULAR CULTURE, WHICH LIONIZE

1293
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
THIS KIND OF VIOLENCE.

1294
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
OBVIOUSLY NOT AGAINST CHILDREN,

1295
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
BUT THE TRENCH COAT MAFIA, THE

1296
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
SORT OF GUNMAN IS A FIGURE WE

1297
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
RECOGNIZE.

1298
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
AND FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THESE

1299
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
VERY MARGINAL BOYS, IT LOOKS

1300
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
MORE APPEALING THAN THE DWEEBIE

1301
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
LONER MISFIT.

1302
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
AND SO WHAT THEY'RE SEEKING TO

1303
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
DO MOST OF THE TIME IS SOLVE A

1304
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
PROBLEM.

1305
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
AND THE PROBLEM IS THEY DON'T

1306
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
LIKE THE WAY OTHER PEOPLE

1307
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
PERCEIVE THEM, AND THEY WANT TO

1308
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
CHANGE IT.

1309
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
AND WHEN THEY START TALKING

1310
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
ABOUT SHOOTING PEOPLE, ALL OF

1311
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
THE SUDDEN THOSE PEER GROUPS

1312
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
START PAYING ATTENTION TO THEM.

1313
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
AND NOW THEY'VE MADE A

1314
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
COMMITMENT OR PROMISE WHAT

1315
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
THEY'RE GOING TO DO, AND THEY

1316
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
FIND THEY CAN'T BACK DOWN OUT OF

1317
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
IT OR IT WOULD BE ONE MORE

1318
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
SOCIAL FAILURE.

1319
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
>> THAT'S INTERESTING.

1320
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
SO IN SOME CASES, ACTUALLY

1321
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
TALKING ABOUT IT, HAVING SAID

1322
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
SOMETHING TO OTHERS, IT KIND OF

1323
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
BUILDS UP THE MOMENTUM OR THE

1324
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
PRESSURE FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY

1325
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
ACT OUT ON IT?

1326
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
>> IT DOES, ANDERSON.

1327
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I MEAN, THEY'RE USUALLY QUITE

1328
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
AMBIVALENT ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE

1329
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
GOING TO DO.

1330
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
BUT WHAT PUSHES THEM PAST THE

1331
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
AMBIVALENCE IS THE POSSIBILITY

1332
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE ONE MORE

1333
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
COMPLETE SOCIAL DISASTER IN

1334
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
WHICH THEY'VE MADE PROMISES, AND

1335
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
NOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FULFILL

1336
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
THEM, AND EVERYBODY IS GOING TO

1337
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
BE LAUGHING AT THEM NOW.

1338
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
AND IT IS AMAZING HOW MUCH THAT

1339
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
MOTIVATE THIS IS BEHAVIOR.

1340
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT HOW

1341
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL PEOPLE OR

1342
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
DESTROY A TOWN.

1343
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW OTHER

1344
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE THEM

1345
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
DIFFERENTLY.

1346
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
LOOK AT THE PICTURES OF THE

1347
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
SHOOTER IN THE VIRGINIA TECH

1348
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
CASE.

1349
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
THERE HE WAS WITH GUNS BLAZING

1350
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
AND A FLAK JACKET, AND HE LOOKS

1351
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
LIKE RAMBO.

1352
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
WELL, THAT LOOKS A LOT BETTER TO

1353
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
HIM, I'M SORRY TO SAY THAN THE

1354
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
DWEEBIE IMAGE OF THE REJECT AND

1355
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
MISFIT.

1356
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
>> AND JUST VERY BRIEFLY,

1357
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
POLITICIANS TALK VIDEO GAMES.

1358
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
DOES THAT -- HAVE YOU SEEN ANY

1359
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
LINK?

1360
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
>> THERE IS A LINK, ANDERSON,

1361
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
BUT IT'S NOT THE LINK WE USUALLY

1362
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
THINK OF.

1363
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
OFTEN PEOPLE THINK THAT VIDEO

1364
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
GAMES WILL SOMEHOW INSPIRE

1365
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
PEOPLE TO FEEL RAGE AND GO OUT

1366
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
AND ENACT IT.

1367
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
INSTEAD, WHAT WE SAW WAS THAT

1368
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
VIDEO GAMES JUST LIKE FILMS

1369
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
PRESENT AN IMAGE OF MASCULINITY

1370
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
THAT IS TIED TO VIOLENCE, AND

1371
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
SORT OF GLAMORIZES IT, AND MAKES

1372
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
THESE BOYS WHO DON'T FEEL VERY

1373
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
GLAMOROUS THAT IF THEY CAN JUST

1374
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
DO THAT, OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING

1375
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
TO TURN AROUND AND LOOK AT THEM

1376
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
DIFFERENTLY.

1377
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
RATHER THAN INSPIRING A KIND OF

1378
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
BOILING RAGE, WHAT IT DOES IS

1379
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
PRESENT AN IMAGE OF HOW A

1380
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
MASCULINE BOY, YOU KNOW, COULD

1381
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
ACT AND BE NOTICED.

1382
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
>> RIGHT.

1383
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000

THEY'LL START CRYING, AND

1487
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
THEY'LL HUG THE DOG.

1488
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
AND TO SOME CHILDREN THEY'LL

1489
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
COME UP SAD AND THEY'LL WALK

1490
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000

WHAT THEY SAID WITH YOU TONIGHT.

1595
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
LYNN McDONNELL TOLD US HOW THEY

1596
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
DON'T WANT TO HAVE HATE IN THEIR

1597
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000

1598
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000

1599
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
TO SAY.

1600
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
>> I HAD SAID THAT TO JACK, THAT

1601
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
IT'S OKAY TO BE ANGRY BECAUSE

1602
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
SURE, WE HAVE ANGER AND WE'RE

1603
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
UPSET AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY.

1604
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
BUT I TOLD JACK THAT HE COULD

1605
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
NEVER LIVE WITH HATE.
GRACE DIDN'T HAVE AN OUNCE OF

1606
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
HATE IN HER.

1607
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
AND SO WE HAVE TO LIVE THROUGH

1608
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
GRACE AND REALIZE THAT HATE IS

1609
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
NOT HOW OUR FAMILY IS AND

1610
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
CERTAINLY NOT HOW GRACE IS.

1611
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
AND I KNOW ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL

1612
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
LITTLE CHILDREN.

1613
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY HATE IN

1614
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
THEM EITHER.

1615
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
SO WE'LL JUST TAKE THE LEAD FROM

1616
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
THEM AND WE WILL NOT GO DOWN

1617
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
THAT ROAD.

1618
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
BUT WE'LL LET THEM GUIDE US.

1619
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
>> DURING THE INTERVIEW, WE WERE

1620
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
TALKING ABOUT GRACE.

1621
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
AND I MENTIONED THAT ONE OF MY

1622
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
FAVORITE SONGS IS "AMAZING

1623
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
GRACE," AND THAT IT ALWAYS MAKES

1624
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
ME CRY.

1625
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I SAID I'LL NEVER HEAR THAT SONG

1626
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
AGAIN WITHOUT THINKING OF THEIR

1627
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
GRACE.

1628
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
AND LYNN LIKED THAT IDEA.

1629
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
BUT SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

1630
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
WHEN YOU HEAR THAT SONG, YOU

1631
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
SMILE, THAT YOU DON'T CRY.

1632
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
ANOTHER THING THAT LYNN SAID

1633
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
THAT GIVES HER SOME COMFORT TO

1634
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
THINK THAT GRACE DIED WITH HER

1635
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
FRIENDS, AND THAT THEY WERE

1636
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
HOLDING HANDS WHEN THEY DIED.

1637
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
SHE LIKES TO THINK OF THEM ALL

1638
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
IN HEAVEN, ALL 20 OF THOSE

1639
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
