EVERY SINGLE ROUND OF AMMUNITION

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
WILL BE LOOKED AT.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
HAPPENS AGAIN.

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000

THE MOMENT WHEN SHE SAID SHE

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
KNEW SOMETHING TERRIBLE WAS

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
HAPPENING.

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW SHE

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
NOISES AND HID UNDER HER COMPUTE

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
DESK.
>> I COULD SEE HIM FROM THE

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
KNEES DOWN.

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
>> RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU?

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
>> 20 FEET AWAY, HIS BOOTS WERE

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
THEY WERE PETRIFIED AND DIDN'T

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
KNOW HOW MANY SHOOTERS THERE

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
WERE.

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
>> THERE IS ARE IN DETAILS ABOUT

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
THE GUNMAN.

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
A SPOKESMAN SAYS LANZA TOOK

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
CLASSES THERE WHEN SHE WAS JUST

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
EVENTUALLY DROPPING OUT.

FACULTY MEMBER HE SUFFERED A

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
CONDITION WHERE HE PHYSICALLY

87
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
FELT NO PAIN.

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
>> IF HE CUT HIMSELF OR HURT

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
HIMSELF HE WOULD NOT KNOW IT OR

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
FEEL IT.

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
>> HE WOULD HAVE PERIODS OF

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
TIMES WHEN HE WOULD WITHDRAW

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
ENTIRELY ONTO HIMSELF.

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
>> RICHARD SAYS LANZA HAD

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
SEVERAL DISORDERS AND WAS SEEING

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST.

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
THE BUT WERE WORRIED THAT HE

98
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
COULD BE BULLIED OR HARM

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
HIMSELF.

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
>> THEY SAY IT DEMANDS IMMEDIATE

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
NATIONAL ACTION.

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
ANNOUNCEMENT COMES AS NEW POLL

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
WANT STRICTER GUN LAWS, 59%

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
SUPPORT A BAN ON HIGH CAPACITY

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
CLIPS AND 52% WANT A BAN ON

SEMI-AUTOMATIC HANDGUNS.

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
>> I THINK IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL

109
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
TO HAVE A WEAPON WHOSE ONLY

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
PURPOSE IS TO KILL LARGE NUMBERS

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
OF PEOPLE.
I THINK IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL TO

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
SELL BULLETS WHOSE ONLY PURPOSE

113
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
IS TO PIERCE ARMORED VESTS.

114
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
LAST TIME I SAW A DEER WEARING

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
AN ARMORED VEST WAS LONG TIME

116
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
AGO.

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
>> DIANNE FEINSTEIN SAYS SHE

ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN.

120
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
SHOWERS BUT NOT LIKE THE STEADY

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
RAIN WE SAW THIS MORNING THAT

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
CAUSED ACCIDENTS AND EVEN A

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
COUPLE OF RAINBOWS.

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
TERRY McSWEENEY IS LIVE IN SAN

JOSE TO TELL US MORE.

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
>> SOME PEOPLE LOOK AT THIS

142
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
STUFF AND THEY SAY IT'S NOTHING

143
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
BUT NUISANCE RAIN AND CAUSES CAR

144
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
CRASHES AND DOESN'T PRODUCE

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
ENOUGH RUNOFF TO HELP THE LOW

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
RESERVOIRS IN THE SANTA CLARA

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
VALLEY BUT SOME PEOPLE SAY, IT'S

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
>> THIS IS VIDEO OF I-280 IN

BURLINGAME.

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
A PICTURE SIMILAR TO THE VIEW

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
FROM THE FRONT SEAT OF CARS

153
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA THIS

154
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
MORNING.

155
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
WITH THE RAIN, COME SPINOUTS

156
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
NEAR THE 380 INTERCHANGE.

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
MANNY MAYBE MORE DRIVERS SHOULD

158
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
FOLLOW HER ADVICE.

159
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
>> SLOW DOWN.

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO

161
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
SLOWDOWN IN CALIFORNIA WHEN IT

162
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
STARTS TO RAIN.

163
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
>> THE RAIN BRINGS BEAUTY LIKE

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
THE RAINBOW IN THE SOUTH BAY.

165
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
JEWEL CAN TELL YOU ABOUT

166
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
RAINBOWS.

167
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
>> THEY ARE PRETTY AND THEY ARE

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
COLORFUL WITH RED AND BLUE AND

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
THEY EVEN HAVE BROWN AND BLACK.

170
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
IF THERE ARE NO COLORS IT'S JUST

171
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
A BLACK RAINBOW IT WOULDN'T BE

172
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
LIKE THAT.

173
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
>> AND IN THE SANITY CRUZ

174
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
MOUNTAINS, THE HEAVY MIST CAME

175
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
DOWN FOR HOURS AND HOURS.

176
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT WHAT

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
RAIN DOES FOR HER SCHEDULE AT

178
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
SCHOOL.

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
>> WE WATCH A MOVE.

180
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
>> WHAT IS THE MOVE TODAY?

181
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO BE?

182
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
>> AND SOME PEOPLE WEREN'T

183
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
THINKING MUCH ABOUT THE RAIN AT

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
YOU WILL ALL?

185
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
>> NO.

186
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
>> DOESN'T MAKE YOU LATE FOR

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
WORK?
>> NO, I LIVE CLOSE BY.

188
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
WEATHER IS KIND OF NOTHING TO

189

NOT ONLY TONIGHT BUT WEDNESDAY

453
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
