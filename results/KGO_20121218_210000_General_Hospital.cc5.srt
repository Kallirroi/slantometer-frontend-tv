DON'T -- PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T

1251
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
GIVE UP HOPE.

1252
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
YOU CAN'T.

1253
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
YOU GOT TO KEEP LOOKING FOR
SOMEBODY TO FINANCE THE NURSES'

1254

WELL, LET ME JUST GIVE YOU MY

1264
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000

00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
IT WOULD BE PERFECT ON YOUR
BEAUTIFUL SKIN TONE.

>> Felix: SHUT UP!

1270
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000

>> Patrick: YEAH, WE DID.

1278
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T TEXT YOU
ABOUT THAT.

1279
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

1280
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
>> Patrick: IT'S NOT THAT I

1281
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
DIDN'T WANT TO SEE YOU.

1282
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
IT WAS JUST, WHEN YOU SAID THAT

1283
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
THE THREE OF US WOULD DO IT

1284
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
TOGETHER --

1285
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
WELL, IT REMINDED ME OF THE

1286
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA DO

1287
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
AS A FAMILY WITH ROBIN ANYMORE

1288
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
BECAUSE THIS IS OUR FIRST

1289
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
CHRISTMAS WITHOUT HER.

1290
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
>> Britt: PATRICK, PLEASE, YOU

1291
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN.

1292
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I ASSUMED THAT WAS THE REASON.

1293
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
>> Patrick: THANK YOU FOR

1294
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
UNDERSTANDING.

1295
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
>> Britt: HOW COULD I NOT?

1296
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I'M JUST GLAD THAT YOU CALLED.

1297
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
LIKE I SAID, THIS IS MY FAVORITE

1298
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
TIME OF YEAR, AND IT'S MORE FUN

1299
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
TO SPEND IT WITH SOMEONE.

1300
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I BROUGHT EGGNOG --

1301
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000

1302
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
>> Britt: -- AND BOURBON.
>> Patrick: I'M THE HOST.

1303
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THAT

1304
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000

00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I -- OH, I ALSO HAVE A LITTLE
SOMETHING FOR EMMA.

1307
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
WHERE IS SHE?

1308
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
>> Patrick: I PUT HER DOWN A

1309
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
LITTLE BIT AGO.
SHE'S PROBABLY FAST ASLEEP

1310
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
ALREADY.

1311
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
>> Britt: OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

1312
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I WAS HOPING MAYBE WE COULD ALL

1313
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000

1314
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000

1319
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I BOUGHT A COPY WHEN I PICKED UP

00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

1339
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST
BLACK-AND-WHITE MOVIES HOLLYWOOD

1340
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000

TYOU WOULDN'T WANT YOUR
ADOCTOR DOING YOUR JOB,

1350
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
HELLO....

1351
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
SO WHY ARE YOU DOING HERS?

1352
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
ONLY YOUR DOCTOR CAN DETERMINE
IF YOUR PERSISTENT HEARTBURN IS

1353
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
ACTUALLY SOMETHING
MORE SERIOUS,

1354
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
LIKE ACID REFLUX DISEASE.

1355
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
OVER TIME, STOMACH
ACID CAN DAMAGE

1356
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
THE LINING OF YOUR ESOPHAGUS.

1357
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
FOR MANY, PRESCRIPTION NEXIUM
NOT ONLY PROVIDES

1358
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
24-HOUR HEARTBURN RELIEF,

1359
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
BUT CAN ALSO HELP HEAL
ACID-RELATED EROSIONS

1360
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
IN THE LINING OF YOUR ESOPHAGUS.

1361
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
THERE IS RISK OF BONE FRACTURE

1362
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
AND LOW MAGNESIUM LEVELS.

1363
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
SIDE EFFECTS MAY INCLUDE

1364
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
HEADACHE, ABDOMINAL
PAIN AND DIARRHEA.

1365
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
CALL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY IF
YOU HAVE PERSISTENT DIARRHEA.

1366
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
OTHER SERIOUS STOMACH
CONDITIONS MAY EXIST.

1367
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
DON'T TAKE NEXIUM IF
YOU TAKE CLOPIDOGREL.

1368
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
LET YOUR DOCTOR DO HER JOB.

1369
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
AND YOU DO YOURS.

1370
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
ASK IF NEXIUM IS RIGHT FOR YOU.
