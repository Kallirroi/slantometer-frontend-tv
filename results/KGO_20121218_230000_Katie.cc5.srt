00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
>> LOOKING LIKE HELL, RIGHT?

189
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
KATIE: YEAH.

190
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
THAT'S VERY OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S

191
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
VERY HAIRY, REALLY AT THE

192
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE AND I'VE

193
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
GOT TO SAY, HUGH, YOU LOOK VERY

194
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
GNARLY IN THAT SCENE.

195
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
TELL US WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH.

196
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
YOU WENT THROUGH A MAJOR

197
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION TO BE IN

198
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
THIS MOVIE.

199
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
>> IT FELT LIKE 11 YEARS SINCE

200
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'VE HAD CARBOHYDRATES.  HOURS A

201
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
DAY.
KATIE: AND YOU LOST SOMETHING

202
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
LIKE 20 POUNDS?

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
>> I'VE LOST LIKE 20 POUNDS AND

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
THEN I DID THIS CRAZY THING JUST

205
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
BEFORE THAT SCENE, ACTUALLY,

206
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
WHICH WE SHOT WHICH IS A BODY

207
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
BUILDER TRICK OF NOT DRINKING

208
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
ANY LIQUID FOR 30 HOURS OR 36

209
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
HOURS.
AND WHAT THAT DOES, DO NOT TRY

210
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THIS, BY THE WAY.

211
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
RECOMMEND IT.

212
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
YOU LOSE ABOUT 10 POUNDS OF

213
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
WEIGHT, REALLY, ON THE

214
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
EXTREMITIES LIKE ALL THE WATER

215
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
JUST DRAINS OUT.

216
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
YOU GET VERY SUNKEN CHEEKS,

217
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
SUNKEN EYES AND A MASSIVE

218
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
HEADACHE.

219
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
MASSIVE HEADACHE.
KATIE: AND YOU DO THIS AND THEN

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
YOU HAVE TO SING THIS PRETTY

221
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
IMPORTANT SONG, THE FIRST,

222
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
REALLY, SONG OF THE MUSICAL.

223
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
WAS THAT HARD?

224
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE GOING

225
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
TO PASS OUT?

226
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
>> WELL, YOU CAN SEE HOW GRUMPY

227
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I LOOKED.

228
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
THERE WAS NO ACTING REQUIRED.

229
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
EVEN RUSSELL WAS SCARED OF ME

230
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
THAT DAY.

231
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
KATIE: AND YOUR TEETH, THEY WERE

232
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
ALL YELLOW.

233
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
>> THOSE WERE FAKE TEETH.

234
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
KATIE: AND THEN THERE'S A

235
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
WORM-TYPE SCAR.

236
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
>> IT'S NOT MY BEST LOOK.

237
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
KATIE: NO.

238
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
>> WE HAD TO WEAR THE FAKE TEETH

239
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
FOR THREE WEEKS ALL DAY LONG.

240
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
BECAUSE WHEN I FIRST WAS SINGING

241
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
♪

242
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
WHO AM I'M JEAN -- ♪

243
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
NO, THIS IS NOT ICONIC.

244
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
IT TOOK ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS

245
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
TO GET USED TO IT.

246
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
KATIE: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAD

247
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
TO AUDITION FOR THIS MOVIE.

248
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
>> YEAH.

249
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
KATIE: WHO ELSE WOULD THEY USE

250
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
FOR THIS MOVIE, HUGH, REALLY?

251
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
>> WELL, I SUPPOSE IT WAS -- I

252
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
WAS THRILLED TO AUDITION.

253
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I NEVER MINDED AUDITIONING.

254
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I ACTUALLY RANG TOM HOOPER, THE

255
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
DIRECTOR, BEFORE HE HAD EVEN

256
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
SIGNED ON FOR THIS.

257
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I WANTED THIS SO BAD.

258
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I PRETTY MUCH STALKED HIM AND HE

259
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
LITERALLY M CHAIR LIKE

260
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
WAY CLOSER THAN WE ARE AND HE

261
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
GOES OK, JUST --

262
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
KATIE: YOU CAN DO THAT IF YOU

N

264
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
>> ALL RIGHT.

265
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
GOOD.

266
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
[LAUGHTER]

267
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
[APPLAUSE]

268
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
>> YEAH.

269
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
SORRY, HE DIDN'T DO THAT.

270
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
SORRY.

271
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
AND HE GOES DON'T WORRY ABOUT

272
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
ME.
OK.

273
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'M THE CAMERA.

274
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
KATIE: I LOVE MY JOB.

275
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
DID I MENTION HOW MUCH I LOVE MY

276
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
JOB?

277
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
YEAH.

278
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
SO HE JUST -- WHY?

279
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
WHY DID HE DO THAT?

280
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
>> HE SAID NOW I NEED TO WATCH

281
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
YOUR PERFORMANCE FROM HERE

282
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE LIKE

283
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
WHAT IT IS FOR THE AUDIENCE.

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
THE CAMERA, WE'RE GOING TO GET

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
INSIDE YOUR HEAD AND THAT'S THE

286
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
BEAUTY OF THIS.

287
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
WE WERE SINGING LIVE ON THE SET

288
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
BUT UNLIKE THE STAGE WHERE

289
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
YOU'RE ALWAYS HAVING TO TAKE

290
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000

KATIE: HOW DOES SHE PUT UP YOUR

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
SEX SYMBOL STATUS?

297
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
>> I REMIND HER MOST DAYS.

298
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I REMIND HER IN THE MORNING AND

299
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000

300
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000

AMAZING HUGH JACKMAN AND LET'S

307
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER

308
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
MEMBERS OF THE CAST BECAUSE THIS

309
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
IS AN EXTRAORDINARY CAST.
>> WHAT ABOUT THAT ANNE

310
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
HATHAWAY?

311
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
KATIE: OH, SHE ALSO LOST A TON

312
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
OF WEIGHT FOR THAT ROLE,

313
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
SOMETHING LIKE 25 POUNDS.

314
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
SOMEBODY TOLD ME LIKE SHE ATE

315
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
TWO PEANUT BUTTER CRACKERS A DAY

316
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

317
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I SAID I SHOULD TRY THAT DIET.

318
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
>> SHE SAID IT'S FOOD TIME AND

319
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
THAT WOULD COME LIKE GREEN APPLE

320
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
LIKE THAT.

321
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
AND ONCE I -- AND SHE GOES NO, I

322
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
DIDN'T GRAB IT AND SHE WAS

323
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
LITERALLY --

324
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
[LAUGHTER]
KATIE: CAN YOU IMAGINE?

325
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
>> I DID.

326
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
AT ONE POINT, SHE GOT SOME BAKED

327
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
POTATO LIKE THIS.

328
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
AND I WAS LIKE REALLY, ANNE?

329
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
BAKED POTATO?

330
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
COME ON.
YOU'RE REALLY NOT COMMITTING.

331
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I MEAN, BAKED POTATO.

332
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
WAY TOO MANY CARBOHYDRATES.

333
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
KATIE: BUT THE CAST WAS AMAZING.

334
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
SO OBVIOUSLY, YOU LOVED WORKING

335
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
WITH ANNE.

336
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
DID SHE DID THAT NUMBER WITH THE

337
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
OSCARS, BUT YOU'VE NEVER REALLY

338
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
WORKED TOGETHER, RIGHT?

339
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
>> NO.

340
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO WORK WITH

341
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
HER.

342
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I THINK SHE'S ONE OF THE REAL

343
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
TALENTS AND TO SEE HER DO THIS

344
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
WAS SUCH A THRILL.

345
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
AS A FRIEND OF HERS, YOU KNOW,

346
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
HER MUM PLAYED THE ROLE.

347
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
KATIE: RIGHT.

348
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
SHE WAS THE UNDERSTUDY RIGHT?

349
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
>> AND AT AGE 8 OR SOMETHING

350
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
WATCHED HER MOM PLAY FANTINE.

351
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
AND FROM DAY ONE OF FILMING, SHE

352
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
CAME TO SAY WITH THIS "LES MIS"

353
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
JACKET AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE

354
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
POINTED AND IT HAD "KATE" WHICH

355
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
WAS HER MUM'S NAME.

356
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
IT WAS A ORIGINAL WHICH HER MUM

357
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
GAVE HER AS GIFT TO STAR.

358
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
SHE'S THE SECOND GENERATION "LES

359
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
MIS" AND IT WAS AMAZING.

360
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I WAS SO PROUD OF HER.

361
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'M HAPPY WITH HER.

362
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
KATIE: SHE BLEW ME AWAY WITH HER

363
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
PERFORMANCE.

364
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
SHE WAS AMAZING.

365
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
RUSSELL CROWE SAYS JAVERT.

366
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
HE SCARES ME A LITTLE.

367
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
IS HE NICE?

368
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
>> HE NICEST.

369
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
NO, DON'T BE SCARED BY RUSSELL.

370
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
TRUST ME.

371
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
ONE OF THE NICEST MOST LOYAL

372
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
YOUR MARRIAGE WORK?

556
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
16 YEARS, THAT'S NOT THAT LONG

557
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
BUT STILL, THAT'S A NICE PERIOD

558
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
OF TIME, WHICH IS GREAT.

559
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
>> YOU KNOW, I'M AN INDECISIVE

560
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
PERSON.

561
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'M TERRIBLE TO GO TO A

562
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
RESTAURANT WITH.

563
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I COULD SPEND 10 MINUTES ON

564
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
DECIDING WHAT TO EAT, WHAT TO

565
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
DRINK.
WHEN I'M WITH DEB, IT WAS THE

566
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
CLEAREST THING IN THE WORLD TO

567
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
ME.

568
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I KNEW 100% AND I ALWAYS FEEL

569
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
FOR PEOPLE.

570
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
SOME PEOPLE COME TO ME AND GO

571
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
YOU KNOW, I REALLY LOVE HER, I'M

572
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
NOT SURE AND I'VE WRITTEN A LIST

573
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
AND I'M LIKE I CAN'T RELATE TO

574
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
THAT BECAUSE IT WAS BEYOND

575
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
WRITING A LIST.

576
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
THERE WAS NO PROS OR CONS.

577
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
IT WAS I'VE NEVER KNOWN ANYTHING

578
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
AS CONFIDENTLY OR SURE IN MY

579
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
LIFE THAT SHE WAS THE ONE I WAS

580
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
MEANT TO BE WITH AND I THINK FOR

581
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
ME, THAT'S WAS ONE OF THE GREAT

582
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
BLESSINGS BECAUSE IN ANY GREAT

583
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
MARRIAGES, GOOD TIMES, BAD

584
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
TIMES, HARD TIMES, AND GREAT

585
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
TIMES, IT'S JUST ALWAYS IN HERE.

586
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
WHATEVER HAPPENS TO DEB AND I,

587
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
WHATEVER THINGS COME IN OUR

588
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
PATH, I KNEW WE WERE MEANT TO BE

589
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
TOGETHER.

590
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
AND TRULY, SHE IS THE GREATEST

591
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
PERSON I HAVE EVER MET.

592
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
EVER.

593
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
KATIE: AWW, THAT'S SO NICE.

594
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
[APPLAUSE]
WELL, YOU'RE VERY LUCKY.

595
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
YOU'RE BOTH VERY LUCKY TO HAVE

596
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
EACH OTHER.

597
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
>> YEAH.

598
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
COULD PURSUE YOURS.

601
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
DOES IT EVER BOTHER HER THAT

602
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
SHE'S NOT REALLY ACTING ANYMORE?

603
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
>> I THINK AT TIMES.

604
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I THINK AT TIMES, IT DOES.

605
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I THINK FOR ME, SHE IS ONE OF

606
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
THE GREAT ACTORS I KNOW AND

607
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
SHE'S INCREDIBLE.

608
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
IN FACT, SHE HAD A TIME IN

609
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
HOLLYWOOD AND I RUN INTO PEOPLE,

610
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000

TALENTED AND EVERY TIME I HEAR

616
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
THAT, IT REMINDS ME OF SACRIFICE

617
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
SHE'S MADE, HER SELFLESSNESS,

618
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
HER LOVE AND WHAT SHE'S DONE FOR

619
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
THE KIDS.

620
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
AND, YOU KNOW, WE ALWAYS MADE

621
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
FAMILY A PRIORITY BUT I'M

622
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
ACUTELY AWARE EVERY DAY THAT

623
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
WHEN IT COMES TO SACRIFICES, DEB

624
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000

625
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000

AS AN ADULT IN A COLA SUIT?

639
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
>> THANK YOU, ANNE FROM

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000

♪

643
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
SAMBA AND LA BAM BA ♪

647

[APPLAUSE]

649
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
KATIE: THAT'S LIKE THROWING OUT

650
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
RAW MEAT TO THIS CROWD.

651
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
THAT BECAUSE THE SCENE FROM "THE

652
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
BOYS FROM OZ" CONSIDERED ONE OF

653
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
HUGH'S FINEST ROLE BUT HE WOULD

654
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
SAY HIS BEST WORK IS RAISING

655
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
OSCAR AND AVA.

656
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
YOU LOVE BEING A DAD, DON'T YOU?

657
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
YOU'RE THE YOUNGEST, RIGHT?

658
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
>> YES.

659
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
MY MUM AND DAD HAD FIVE AND MY

660
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
MUM HAD ANOTHER DAUGHTER.

661
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
SO I REALLY GREW UP IN TERMS OF

662
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
MY HOUSEHOLD, THE YOUNGEST OF

663
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
FIVE.

664
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
AND I LOVE THE CHAOS OF FAMILY.

665
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
HONESTLY, THE -- IT IS, THE

666
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
CALMER I GET.

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
AND 16 AND I WISH I HAD MORE

669
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
KIDS.

670
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I LIKE THE NOISE AND THE CHAOS

671
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
TOO.

672
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
>> HOW ARE YOUR KIDS?

673
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
KATIE: THEY'RE GREAT.

674
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
KERRY'S 16.

675
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
AND IN HER JUNIOR OF HIGH

676
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
SCHOOL.

677
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
AND LAST NIGHT --

679
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
KATIE: NO.
YOU MEAN ELLY?

680
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
KERRY IS THE YOUNGEST ONE.

681
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
STUDYING  STUDYING LAST

682
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
NIGHT AND SHE SAID PLEASE STAY

683
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
UP WITH ME.

684
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
SO I WAS LIKE OH, THE GUILTY.

685
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
-- GUILT.

686
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
>> YEAH, RIGHT.

687
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
KATIE: AND I SAID I WILL JUST

688
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
LIE HER.

689
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
AND AT 1:00, I'M SLEEPING VERY

690
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
HAPPY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I

691
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
HEAR THIS CRYING IN THE ROOM

692
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
NEXT DOOR AND I WOKE UP AND SHE

693
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
GOES I'M JUST REALLY STRESSED

694
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
OUT.
YEAH, I KNOW.

695
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
IT'S TERRIBLE.

696
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
ALL RIGHT.

697
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE KIDS

698
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
BECAUSE OSCAR IS ALMOST 13.

699
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
AVA IS 8, RIGHT?

700
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
>> ALMOST 8.

701
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
KATIE: AND I KNOW THEY HAVE

702
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE

703
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
PAPARAZZI.

704
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
SOMETIMES I SEE THERE'S HUGH

705
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
GOING RUNNING INTO THE SURF WITH

706
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
HIS KIDS.

707
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
OSCAR HATED IT, RIGHT?

708
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
>> HE ALWAYS HATED IT HE WAS

709
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
LIKE 2 1/2 AND HE CAMED HE

710
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
AND HE WOULD START CRYING JUST

711
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
WITH THE FLASH AND ALL OF THAT.

712
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
HE REALLY HATED IT.

713
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
AND LUCKILY NOW, ACTUALLY IN

714
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
AUSTRALIA, I GET A FAIR BIT OF

715
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
-- THEY'LL LEAVE US ALONE.

716
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
EVEN THE PHOTOGRAPHERS CAN TELL

717
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
IT'S A REAL DOWNER FOR HIM.

718
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO PROTECT

719
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
HIM.

720
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
IT WAS MEG RYAN AGAIN -- I ASKED

721
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH YOUR SON?

722
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
AND SHE'S LIKE WHAT DO YOU --

723
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
YOU LOOK AT THEM FROM THEIR

724
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
VIEW.

725
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
ALL THE PEOPLE WILL ASK FOR

726
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
THEIR PHOTOGRAPH.

727
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
AND HE GOES THIS IS THEIR TIME

728
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
WITH YOU AND THEY'RE HOLDING

729
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
THEIR HAND AND SO IT'S RARE TO

730
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
GET TIME WITH YOU.

731
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
SO WHAT SHE DOES AND WHAT I NOW

732
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
DO IS I ALWAYS ASK THE KIDS IF

733
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
THEY MIND IF THEY TAKE A PHOTO?

734
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
AND PEOPLE SAY HANG ON.

735
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'VE GOT CHECK WITH MY KIDS.

736
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
AND SOMETIMES, THEY'LL SAY YES

737
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
AND SOMETIMES THEY'LL SAY NO.

738
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
BUT FOR A LONG TIME, I WOULD SAY

739
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
NO, I'M WITH MY KIDS AND

740
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
FINALLY, MY SON GOES DAD, WHY

741
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
CAN'T YOU JUST BE NICE?

742
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
THEY JUST WANT A PHOTOGRAPH.

743
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
[LAUGHTER]
KATIE: YOU CAN'T WIN, RIGHT?

744
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
>> NO.

745
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
BUT MY DAUGHTER ON THE OTHER

746
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
HAND, WE WILL GO OUT AND I'LL

747
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
SEE C.C. THE PAPARAZZI TO THE

748
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
RIGHT AND I WILL TURN LEFT AND

749
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
SHE GOES WHERE ARE WE GOING?

750
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
THE PAPARAZZI IS THIS WAY.

751
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
ALL MUGGING, WINK, WINK.

752
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
PULLING MY EARS AND DOING THE

753
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
WHOLE THING.

754
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
KATIE: THAT'S SO FUNNY.

755
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
>> I KNOW.

756
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT THAT.

757
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
KATIE: THEY'RE VERY CUTE KIDS.

758
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
YOU'VE ACTUALLY TALKED VERY

759
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
OPENLY ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU

760
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
AND DEB HAD SOME FERTILITY

761
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
ISSUES AND THE CHILDREN ARE

762
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
ADOPTED.

763
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
AND THAT I THINK PEOPLE DON'T

764
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
REALIZE WHAT AN EXCRUCIATING

765
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
DIFFICULT TIME THAT IS WHEN

766
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
YOU'RE TRYING TO HAVE A CHILD

767
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
AND YOU'RE HAVING A LOT OF

768
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
DIFFICULTY.
>> IT IS.
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING UNTIL

769
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
YOU GO THROUGH IT, YOU REALIZE

770
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT A LOT.

771
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
DEB AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE

772
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
KIDS.

773
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IN THE

774
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
PROCESS THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

775
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
BIOLOGICALLY, WE TRIED AND IT

776
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
WAS NOT HAPPENING FOR US AND IT

777
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
IS A DIFFICULT TIME.

778
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
WE DID AN I.V.F. AND DEB HAD A

779
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
COUPLE OF MISCARRIAGES AND THE

780
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
MISCARRIAGE THING IS ALSO -- AND

781
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
APPARENTLY, HAPPEN TO ONE IN

782
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
THREE PREGNANCY BUT IT'S VERY,

783
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
VERY RARELY TALKED ABOUT.

784
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
IT'S ALMOST SECRETIVE.

785
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
SO I HOPE DEB DOESN'T MINE ME

786
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
BRINGING IT UP NOW BUT IT'S A

787
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
GOOD THING TO TALK ABOUT.

788
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
IT'S MORE COMMON AND IT IS

789
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
TOUGH.

790
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
THERE'S A GRIEVING YOU HAVE TO

791
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
GO THROUGH.

792
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
THE MOMENT OSCAR WAS BORN, YOU

793
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
KNOW, ALL THE HEARTACHE JUST

794
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
MELTED AWAY AND IT'S ONE OF THE

795
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
GREAT -- WELL, YOU GUYS, MANY OF

796
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
YOU ARE PARENTS, YOU KNOW.

797
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
YOU CAN'T PREPARE FOR THAT

798
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
MOMENT.
NOTHING CAN PREPARE YOU.

799
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
YOU CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN HOW

800
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
INCREDIBLE IT IS AND THAT

801
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
AVALANCHE OF EMOTIONS IT COMES

802
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
AND HOW IT OPENS UP YOUR HEART,

803
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
HOW IT FRUSTRATES YOU, HOW IT

804
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
ANGER YOU, HOW EVERYTHING IS ALL

805
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
OF A SUDDEN, ALIVE OF YOU AS A

806
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
APPARENT.
>> IT'S -- PARENT.

807
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
KATIE: IT'S SO HUMBLING BECAUSE

808
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
YOU'RE SURROUNDED WITH PEOPLE

809
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
WHO ARE DOING FOR YOU AND YOU'RE

810
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
OBVIOUSLY THE CELEBRATED PERSON

811
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
AND JUSTIFIABLY SO, BUT TO BE

812
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
ONE-ON-ONE WITH A CHILD WHO

813
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
REALLY HAS NO REASON TO LOVE YOU

814
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
EXCEPT THAT YOU'RE THERE IS, I

815
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
THINK, KIND OF BRINGS YOU BACK

816
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
TO A VERY IMPORTANT PLACE, DON'T

817
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
YOU THINK?

818
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
>> CONSTANTLY.

819
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOT A DAY, YOU

820
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
KNOW, I SING EVERY DAY.

821
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
IT'S PART OF MY DAILY ROUTINE.

822
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
DAD, PLEASE, CAN YOU STOP IT?

823
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I HATE IT WHEN YOU SING.

824
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
STOP.
[LAUGHTER]
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE -- I DON'T

825
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
WANT TO HEAR OTHER PEOPLE.

826
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

827
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
IT IS VERY HUMBLING.

828
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
KATIE: THE OTHER THING I THINK

829
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
PROBABLY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT

830
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
YOU OR SOME PEOPLE IS THAT YOUR

831
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
DAD RAISED THE FIVE KIDS.

832
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
YOUR MOM LEFT WHEN YOU WERE 8

833
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
YEARS OLD.

834
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
SHE WENT TO ENGLAND AND I THINK

835
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
HER MOM WAS SICK, RIGHT?

836
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
>> YEAH.

837
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'M THE YOUNGEST.

838
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
SO MY OLDEST SISTER WAS 16.

839
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
SO MY MUM IS THERE FOR MANY,

840
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
MANY YEARS BUT OBVIOUSLY FROM

841
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
WHEN I WAS 8 THROUGH UNTIL 18,

842
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
MUM WAS LIVING IN ENGLAND.

843
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
AND IT WAS HARD.

844
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I WAS IN AUSTRALIA AND HER MUM

845
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
WAS VERY, VERY ILL.

846
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
SO SHE WENT BACK -- I DON'T

847
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
THINK SHE EVER EXPECTED IT TO GO

848
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
ON THAT LONG, YOU KNOW.

849
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
KATIE: WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

850
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I KNOW YOU WOULD SEE HER ONCE A

851
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
YEAR.
>> YEAH.

852
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
KATIE: SHE LEFT HER FIVE KIDS.

853
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
THAT SEEMS SO STRANGE.

854
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
>> YOU KNOW, LOOK, OBVIOUSLY,

855
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
MUM AND I HAVE COME TO PEACE

856
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
WITH IT.
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF TALKS AND MY

857
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
MOM IS A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL

858
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
PERSON AND I LOVE HER VERY MUCH

859
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
AND WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME

860
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
TOGETHER.

861
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
AND SHE -- AGAIN, I DON'T THINK

862
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
SHE MINDS ME SAYING THIS BUT SHE

863
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
SUFFERED VERY SEVERELY FROM

864
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
PERSONAL SEVERE DEPRESSION.

865
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
SHE HAD A VERY TOUGH TIME AND

866
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
WITHOUT GETTING INTO SPECIFICS

867
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
TO GO THROUGH THAT, AND STILL

868
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
HAVE FIVE KIDS AND BE AWAY FROM

869
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
YOUR SUPPORT NETWORK.
BECAUSE THEY ALL CAME FROM

870
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
ENGLAND TO AUSTRALIA SO FEELING

871
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
VERY MUCH ON HER OWN, I THINK TO

872
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
SURMISE IT IN THE BEST WAY I CAN

873
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
TO SUPPORT MY MUM THAT SHE KIND

874
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
OF WOKE UP IN A WAY, A LITTLE

875
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
LATER AFTER IT ALL HAPPENED, YOU

876
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
KNOW, AND SHE SAID TO ME, SHE

877
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
FEELS LIKE OH, THAT WAS LIKE

878
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
ANOTHER PERSON WHEN I MADE ALL

879
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
THOSE DECISIONS.

880
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
YOU ALL ARE O YOU ALL ARE ON G

881
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
TERMS NOW
>> YEAH.

882
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I NEVER FELT MY MUM DIDN'T LOVE

883
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
ME.

884
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
HONEST, I NEVER HAD THAT ANGER

885
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
OF BALTIMORE OR WHATEVER PEOPLE

886
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
OR -- ABANDONMENT OR WHATEVER

887
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
MIGHT HAPPEN.

888
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I ALWAYS FELT GREAT LOVE FOR MY

889
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
MUM AND DAD.

890
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
WHAT MY DAD DID, THAT WAS A

891
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
DECADE OF HIS LIFE.

892
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
HE NEVER HAD A SECOND TO

893
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
HIMSELF.

894
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
EVER.
AND HE NEVER ONCE COMPLAINED.

895
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
AND ONE OF THE TIMES I'M MOST

896
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
ASHAMED ABOUT AS A KID WAS A

897
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
COUSIN CAME OVER AND FROM

898
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
ENGLAND.
I'VE NEVER MET HIM BEFORE.

899
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
MATTHEW.

900
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
AND HE PULLED ME AND MY BROTHER

901
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
ASIDE AND GOES YOU GUYS SHOULD

902
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.

903
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
AND I GO WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

904
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
ABOUT?

905
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
YOUR FATHER, HE COMES HOME 7:00,

906
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
AFTER WORKING ALL DAY.

907
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
HE GOES STRAIGHT THE KITCHEN AND

908
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
COOKS YOU GUYS IN THE MEAL AND

909
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
THE ONLY THING I'VE HEARD YOU

910
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
GUYS SAY IS WHAT TIME IS DINNER,

911
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
DAD?
AND YOU NEVER CAME TO HELP.

912
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
AND I SAT THERE AND IT WAS LIKE

913
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS WAVE OF

914
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
OH, MY GOD.
IT REALLY HIT ME AT AGE 14, YOU

915
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
KNOW, WHAT MY FATHER HAD DONE.

916
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
KATIE: AND THE SUFFICE TO SEE HE

917
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
MADE FOR YOU -- SACRIFICE TO SEE

918
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
HE MADE FOR YOU GUYS.

928
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
SPECIAL MOMENT ABOUT YOU AND

929
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
YOUR DAD.

930
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000

00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
MY DAD WORKED HARD, VERY

935
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000

936
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
WORK IN HIS LIFE AND ALWAYS VERY

937
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
SWEET ABOUT THE WORK I'VE DONE,

938
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
EVEN WHEN IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE

939
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
"VAN HELSING" THAT HE HAD NO

940
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
INTEREST IN.

941
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
WONDERFUL, HUGH.

942
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
YOU WERE JUST WONDERFUL.

943
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
[LAUGHTER]
VAN HELSING IS JUST REALLY, YOU

944
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000

THANKS, DAD.

945
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
TOLD HIM TOLD HIM I WAS GOING

946
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
TO PERFORM "CAROUSEL" AT

947
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
CARNEGIE HALL, HE COULDN'T HIDE

948
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
HIS ENTHUSIASM.

949
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I'M GOING.

950
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
AND HE DID AND HE TOOK THREE

951
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
DAYS OFF WORK FOR THE FIRST DAY

952
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
OF HIS LIFE AND IT'S A 24-HOUR

953
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
FLIGHT FROM SYDNEY TO NEW YORK.

954
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
KATIE: DID YOU KNOW HE WAS

955
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
COMING?
>> YEAH.

956
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
AND HE WAS THERE FOR 24 HOURS,

957
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
LITERALLY GOT BACK, FLIED BACK

958
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
STRAIGHT TO THE OFFICE.

959
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
AND HE'S A STICKLER TO DETAILS,

960
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
MY DAD.

961
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
SO HE WANTED TO KNOW EVERYTHING

962
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
ABOUT THE ITINERARY, DRESS ROAD,

963
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
HOTEL, IT WAS BLACK TIE, THE

964
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
WHOLE THING.

965
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
AND THE DAY HE ARRIVED WAS THE

966
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
DAY OF THE PERFORMANCE AND I

967
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
FOUND OUT IT WAS NOT BLACK TIE.

968
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
IT WAS ACTUALLY BUSINESS CASUAL

969
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
AND I'M FREAKING OUT.

970
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
IT'S SUMMER.

971
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I THOUGHT HE WAS ARRIVING IN

972
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
SHORTS AND THONGS.

973
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
FLIP-FLOPS OR SOMETHING.

974
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
SO I RANG HIM AND I SAID DAD,

975
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
IT'S NOT BLACK TIE, IT'S

976
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
BUSINESS CASUAL.

977
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
HE GOES I'VE GOT IT COVERED.

978
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
HE SAYS HUGH, PLEASE DO ME A

979
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
FAVOR.
I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU.

980
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I KNOW IT'S A BIG NIGHT FOR YOU.

981
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
DON'T WORRY, BUT I WOULD JUST

982
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
LOVE AND PICK YOU UP AT YOUR

983
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
HOTEL ROOM AND WALK YOU TO THE

984
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
STAGE BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE.

985
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I WAS VERY TOUCHED BY THAT.

986
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
AND I SAID GREAT.

987
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I SAID MAYBE AT 6 -- MEET ME AT

988
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
6:30.

989
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
KNOCK ON THE DOOR.

990
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
HE'S AN ACCOUNTANT.

6:30 AND THERE'S MY FATHER IN

992
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000

993
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
AND I GO WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

994
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
NO ONE IS WEARING THE BLACK TIE

995
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
EXCEPT THE CHOIR.

996
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
AND HE LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE

997
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
EYE AND HE SAID "HUGH, MY SON IS

998
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
SINGING AT CARNEGIE HALL.

999
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000

1076
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
