1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
FAMILY AND MY WIFE AND MY

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
DAUGHTERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF AND

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
THAT IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
CAN DO TO HELP ANYBODY AT ANY

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
TIME, ANYWHERE, I'D BE WILLING

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
TO DO THAT.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT HAPPENED

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO SO MANY

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN INTO

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US, BUT

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US TO BE

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
BETTER, TO BE MORE COMPASSIONATE

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
AND MORE HUMBLE PEOPLE.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
>> A FATHER, A FAMILY, A

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
COMMUNITY IN GRIEF.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
THEIR HEARTS ARE HEAVY.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
>>> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
FROM NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, I'M

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
ANDERSON COOPER BACK FOR A
SPECIAL EDITION OF "360"

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
TONIGHT.
THIS IS THE SMALL TOWN WHERE

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
THIS CRIME SHOCKED THE ENTIRE

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
NATION JUST ONE DAY AGO.
POLICE TONIGHT ARE STILL COMBING

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL EVERY

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
CRACK AND CREVICE.
THOSE ARE THEIR WORDS, OF THE

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE A GUNMAN

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
SHOT 26 PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM 6
AND 7-YEAR-OLDS.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
THEY'RE ALSO AT THE HOME OF THE

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
MAN IDENTIFIED AS THE SHOOTER,
TRYING TO LEARN ANY CLUES THEY

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
CAN ABOUT WHY HE DID WHAT HE

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
DID, WHY THIS SCHOOL IN
PARTICULAR.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL BE HERE

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
TOMORROW VISITING THE FAMILIES

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
OF THE VICTIMS, THE 20 KIDS AND

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
THE SIX ADULTS KILLED IN THE

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
SCHOOL.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
ALSO TALKING TO FIRST RESPONDERS

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
AND TALKING AT A PRAYER VIGIL

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
TOMORROW EVENING.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THOSE

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
YOUNG VICTIMS TONIGHT, THOSE 12
GIRLS AND EIGHT LITTLE BOYS SHOT

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
DEAD IN THEIR CLASSROOMS.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
MOST OF WHAT WE'RE LEARNING IS

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
FROM THEIR PARENTS WHO ARE

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
SHARING THEIR GRIEF VERY
PUBLICLY TONIGHT.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
KYUNG LAH, YOU WERE THERE

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
EARLIER WHEN THE FATHER OF

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
EMILIE PARKER CAME OUT OF HIS

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
HOUSE AND WANTED TO TELL PEOPLE,

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
WANTED TO TALK TO TV CAMERAS AND

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
JUST TALK IN A VERY HUMAN WAY

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER, ABOUT WHAT

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
SHE WAS LIKE, ABOUT THE LIFE SHE

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
LIVED.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
>> AND HE WAS VERY CLEAR THAT

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
THE REASON HE WANTED TO COME OUT

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
AND FACE CAMERAS -- HE KNOWS

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
THIS IS NATIONAL TELEVISION, HE

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY KNEW THAT HE

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU AND HE

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
ALSO WANTED TO SHARE A MESSAGE,

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
THAT WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS,

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
THAT SOCIETY CANNOT BE DEFINED

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
BY THIS SINGLE ACT.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
HE LOST A 6-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
AND IT'S ONE THING TO THINK

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
ABOUT THE NUMBER.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
TO WATCH THIS MAN TALK, TO LOOK

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
AT THE PICTURES OF THIS

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
BEAUTIFUL GIRL AND TO FULLY

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
COMPREHEND THAT THIS FAMILY HAS

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
SUFFERED A TRUE, TRUE LOSS.

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD US.

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
>> I WAS LEAVING TO WORK, AND

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
SHE WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
AND I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TEACHING

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
HER PORTUGUESE.

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
SO OUR LAST CONVERSATION WAS IN

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
PORTUGUESE.

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
AND ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
AND I SAID THAT I WAS DOING

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
WELL.

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME AND I

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THE DOOR.

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
WAS AND HOW MANY LIVES THAT SHE

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
WAS ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT

95
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
TIME HERE ON EARTH.

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
VERY LOVING.

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
MY DAUGHTER EMILIE WOULD BE ONE

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE STANDING

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
AND GIVING HER LOVE AND SUPPORT

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS BECAUSE

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THAT'S THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
SHE IS, NOT BECAUSE OF ANY

104
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
PARENTING THAT MY WIFE AND I

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
COULD HAVE DONE BUT BECAUSE

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THOSE WERE THE GIFTS THAT WERE
GIVEN TO HER BY HER HEAVENLY

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
FATHER.

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
>> AND HE ALSO SAID THAT HE WAS

109
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
VERY PROUD TO BE HER FATHER,

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE THE BEST
FATHER HE COULD TO HIS TWO

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
REMAINING CHILDREN, A 3-YEAR-OLD

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
AND A 4-YEAR-OLD GIRL, HER

113
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
SISTERS.

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
HE DID ALSO SAY THAT HE WANTED

115
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
TO MAKE SURE THAT HE EXTENDED

116
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
HIS CONDOLENCES TO THE SHOOTER'S

117
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
FAMILY BECAUSE THEY ALSO

118
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
SUFFERED A LOSS, ANDERSON.

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
AND THE THING THAT'S REALLY

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
EXTRAORDINARY IS HOW HE'S ABLE

121
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
TO GET HIS MESSAGE OUT AND STILL

122
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
KEEP IT TOGETHER.

123
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
IT'S REALLY -- IT'S HARD TO

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
WATCH AND TO COMPREHEND.

125
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
>> HOW DOES A FATHER TELL A 3

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
AND A 4-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER THAT

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
THEIR SISTER, THEIR BIG SISTER

128
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
IS GONE?

129
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE.

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
KYUNG LAH, APPRECIATE YOU

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
REPORTING TONIGHT.

132
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
RESIDENTS OF STRATFORD,

133
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
CONNECTICUT, REMEMBER VICTORIA

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
SOTO WHO GREW UP THERE.

135
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
SHE WAS 27 YEARS OLD.

136
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
SHE TAUGHT FIRST GRADE AT SANDY

137
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY.

138
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THEY WERE WEARING THOSE COLORS

139
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
BECAUSE THAT WAS HER FAVORITE

140
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
COLOR, GREEN.

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
JASON CARROLL JOINS ME NOW, MORE

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
ON THE VIGIL.

143
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
SOUNDS AS THOUGH THE COMMUNITY

144
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
REALLY ADORED THAT TEACHER AND

145
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
TONIGHT WANTED TO KIND OF SHOW

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THAT IN A VERY PUBLIC WAY.

147
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
>> YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT,

148
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
ANDERSON.

149
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED

150
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
HERE TONIGHT.

151
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
THE FAMILY SAYING THAT IT

152
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
BASICALLY ALL STARTED ON

153
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
FACEBOOK WITH A FACEBOOK

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
MESSAGE, LET'S GET TOGETHER,

155
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
LET'S FIND OUT A WAY TO HONOR

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
VICTORIA, VICKI, AS HER FAMILY

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
AND FRIENDS CALLED HER.

158
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
VICTORIA SOTO.

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
THAT'S WHAT THEY DID.

160
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
THEY CAME OUT HERE TONIGHT IN

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
FRONT OF HER HIGH SCHOOL.
THIS IS WHERE EVERYONE KNEW HER.

162
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT HER

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
SAYING SHE WANTED TO BE A

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
TEACHER EVER SINCE SHE WAS A

165
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
LITTLE GIRL AND THEY TALKED

166
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
ABOUT HOW DEDICATED THIS YOUNG

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
WOMAN WAS TO HER STUDENTS.

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
IN FACT, SHE DIDN'T EVEN REFER

169
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
TO THEM AS STUDENTS.

170
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
SHE ALWAYS REFERRED TO THEM AS

171
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
HER KIDS, HER CHILDREN.

172
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
AND OUT HERE TONIGHT, AS YOU CAN

173
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
IMAGINE WITH HER SISTER BEING

174
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
HERE, HER BROTHER BEING HERE,

175
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
HER PARENTS BEING HERE, HER

176
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
COUSIN HERE AS WELL, AS EVERYONE

177
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
GATHERED TOGETHER AND HUGGED

178
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
EACH OTHER, THEY STRUGGLED TO

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
FIND WAYS TO REMEMBER HER.

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I SPOKE TO ONE YOUNG WOMAN WHO

181
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
KNEW VICKI SOTA THROUGHOUT HER

182
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
ENTIRE LIFE.

183
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
LISTEN TO HOW SHE SPOKE ABOUT

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
HER TONIGHT.

185
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
>> SHE WAS ALWAYS AT THE HOUSE

186
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
SMILING.

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
SHE DROVE US TO CHEERLEADING

188
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
PRACTICES A COUPLE OF TIMES.

189
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'M ALSO A TEACHER AND I CAN'T

190
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
EVEN IMAGINE GOING THROUGH WHAT

191
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
SHE WENT THROUGH.

192
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I THINK HER PUTTING HERSELF OUT

193
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THERE -- SHE'S JUST AN ANGEL AND

194
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
SHE JUST WENT STRAIGHT INTO

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
HEAVEN.

196
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

197
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
>> AS YOU CAN SEE, ANDERSON,

198
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN EMOTIONAL

199
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
STRUGGLE FOR SO MANY PEOPLE OUT

200
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
HERE TONIGHT.

201
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
AT ONE MOMENT, CARLEY SOTO,

202
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
SHE'S 19 YEARS OLD, SHE STOOD IN

203
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
FRONT OF THE SEVERAL HUNDRED

204
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
PEOPLE WHO GATHERED OUT HERE

205
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
TONIGHT AND SHE SPOKE JUST

206
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
BRIEFLY, JUST FOR A MOMENT SHE

207
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
REMINDED THE AUDIENCE TO HUG

208
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
YOUR LOVED ONES BECAUSE YOU JUST

209
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'RE EVER

210
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
GOING TO SEE THEM AGAIN.

211
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
IT WAS A VERY POWERFUL MOMENT AS

212
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
THE FAMILY PAID TRIBUTE TO A

213
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
WOMAN WHO THEY SAY WAS A

214
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
DEDICATED TEACHER, A LOVING

215
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
DAUGHTER AND SOMEONE WHO LOVED

216
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
HER CHILDREN OR HER STUDENTS.

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
ANDERSON?

218
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
>> ONE FAMILY SAYS THEY OWE

219
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
THEIR SON'S LIFE TO VICKI SOTO.

220
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THEY SPOKE WITH KATE BOLDUAN

221
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
ABOUT THEIR CHILD'S ORDEAL

222
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
YESTERDAY AND HOW SHE'S COPING
WITH WHAT HE'S SEEN.

223
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
>> ROBERT AND DIANE LIKATA HAD

224
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
TWO CHILDREN AT THAT ELEMENTARY

225
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
SCHOOL YESTERDAY, A

226
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
SECOND-GRADER AND THEIR SON IN

227
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
FIRST GRADE WHO THEY SAY IT IS A

228
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
MIRACLE HE MADE IT OUT ALIVE

229
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
AFTER COMING FACE TO FACE WITH

230
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
THE SHOOTER.

231
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
>> THAT'S WHEN THEY HEARD NOISES

232
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
THAT THEY INITIALLY THOUGHT WERE

233
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
HAMMERS FALLING.

234
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
THEN THEY REALIZED THAT IT WAS

235
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
GUNSHOTS.

236
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
AND MS. SOTO, WHO WAS ADEN'S

237
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
TEACHER, HAD THE PRESENCE OF

238
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
MIND TO MOVE ALL THE CHILDREN TO

239
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
A DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE DOOR ON

240
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
THE SIDE OF THE ROOM FURTHEST

241
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
AWAY FROM THE DOOR.

242
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THAT'S WHEN THE GUNMAN BURST IN,

243
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
DID NOT SAY A WORD, NO FACIAL

244
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
EXPRESSIONS, AND PROCEEDED TO

245
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
SHOOT THEIR TEACHER.

246
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
AND THEY BASICALLY RAN RIGHT

247
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
NEXT TO THE GUY AND OUT THE

248
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
DOOR.

249
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
>> THEY RAN PAST THE GUNMAN.

250
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
>> THEY RAN PAST THE GUY.

251
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
HE'S STILL STANDING IN THE DOOR

252
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
AND THEY RAN PAST HIM AND RAN

253
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
DOWN THE HALLWAY AND THEY'RE ONE

254
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
OF THE CLOSEST ROOMS TO THE MAIN

255
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
ENTRANCE.

256
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
AND ADEN WAS -- HAD THE PRESENCE

257
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
OF MIND TO HOLD THE DOOR FOR ONE

258
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
OF HIS CLASSMATES.

259
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE OF HIS

260
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
CLASSMATES THAT WAS A LITTLE
BEHIND.

261
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
WAITED FOR HIM AND THEY RAN OUT

262
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
TO THE MAIN ROAD.

263
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
>> WE KNOW HIS TEACHER, VICTORIA

264
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
SOTO, DIED IN THAT CLASSROOM

265
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
TRYING TO PROTECT HER STUDENTS.

266
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
HE KNOWS HIS TEACHER WAS SHOT.

267
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
DO YOU THINK HE KNOWS THAT SHE

268
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
LIKELY DID NOT MAKE IT?
>> HE KEEPS ASKING ABOUT HER.

269
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I THINK HE'S REASSURING HIMSELF

270
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

271
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
HE REALLY, REALLY CARED ABOUT

272
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
HIS TEACHER.

273
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
HE WAS VERY CLOSE WITH HER.

274
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
AND SHE REALLY LOVED THAT CLASS.

275
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
AND HE KEEPS SAYING, I REALLY

276
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
HOPE SHE'S OKAY, I HOPE IT'S NOT

277
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
HER.

278
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
HE KNOWS THAT SHE'S BEEN HURT

279
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW THE END

280
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
RESULT.

281
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
HE KNOWS THE KIDS THAT HE SAW

282
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
GETTING SHOT.

283
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE OUTCOME.

284
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
SO I THINK HE'S REASSURING

285
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
HIMSELF IN HIS 6-YEAR-OLD MIND.

286
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I KNOW HE'S PROCESSING IT.

287
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
BUT I THINK HE'S REASSURING

288
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
HIMSELF.
I THINK HE'S TELLING HIMSELF

289
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

290
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
WE HAD TO PUT THE SIGN OUT IN

291
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
THE FRONT TODAY ASKING PEOPLE

292
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
NOT TO RING THE DOORBELL BECAUSE

293
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
HE STILL HASN'T INTERNALIZED THE

294
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
FACT THAT THIS GUNMAN, THIS BAD

295
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
GUY IS GONE.

296
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
AND HE WANTS TO KNOW IF THERE

297
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
ARE MORE BAD GUYS IN THE WORLD.

298
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER

299
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
THAT QUESTION PROPERLY AND SO

300
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
WHEN SOMEONE RINGS THE DOORBELL,

301
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
HE THINKS IT'S HIM COMING

302
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
BACK -- COMING FOR HIM.

303
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
AND SO HE -- SO I THINK OUR

304
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
BIGGEST CONCERN NOW IS MAKING

305
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
SURE THAT WE HANDLE HIS

306
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
SENSITIVE NATURE PROPERLY AND

307
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
CAREFULLY AND SUPPORT HIM AND

308
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
SUPPORT OUR DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE

309
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
AGAIN DOES PROCESS THINGS VERY

310
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
DIFFERENTLY THAN HE DOES.

311
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
SO THAT'S OUR JOB AS PARENTS NOW

312
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
IS TO STAY CLOSE TO THEM, HOLD

313
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
THEM, HUG THEM, LOVE THEM AND

314
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE

315
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
SAFE.

316
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
>> THEY DID NOT WANT THEIR
CHILDREN TO BE PART OF THE

317
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
INTERVIEW.

318
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
BUT I DID SPEND TIME WITH THEM

319
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
THIS MORNING.

320
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
AND ADEN AND HIS SISTER, THEY

321
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
SEEMED IN HIGH SPIRITS.

322
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
BUT CLEARLY SHAKEN.

323
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
AND AS HARD AS IT HAS BEEN FOR

324
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
THIS FAMILY, THEY SAY THAT THEIR

325
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
HEARTS GO OUT TO THE SO MANY

326
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
OTHER FAMILIES WHO CANNOT GO

327
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
HOME AND HUG THEIR CHILDREN

328
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
TONIGHT.

329
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
ANDERSON?

330
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
>> KATE THANK YOU.

331
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
ONE OF THE BUSIEST PLACES IN

332
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, TODAY MAY

333
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
HAVE BEEN THE GRIEF COUNSELING

334
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
CENTER, BOTH VICTIMS AND THOSE

335
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
AFFECTED BY WHAT HAPPENED FRIDAY

336
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
GOT THE CHANCE TO SPEAK TO

337
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
SOMEONE IF THEY WANTED ABOUT

338
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
WHAT THEY WERE FEELING.

339
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
FOR SOME, THE HEALING COMES IN

340
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
HONORING THOSE VICTIMS.

341
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
ALL DAY LONG, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

342
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
CREATING GIANT MEMORIALS TO

343
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
THOSE WHO WERE KILLED.

344
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'M JOINED NOW BY DR. SANJAY

345
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
GUPTA WHO WAS AT THAT COUNSELING

346
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
CENTER EARLIER.

347
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
WE'RE LOOKING AT A PICTURE THERE

348
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
OF ONE OF THE MAKESHIFT

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
MEMORIALS THAT'S SPRUNG UP, SO

350
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
OFTEN SPRUNG UP IN TRAGEDIES
LIKE THIS.

351
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
PEOPLE SPONTANEOUSLY EXPRESSING

352
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
THEIR SORROW, EXPRESSING THEIR

353
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
GRIEF AND THEIR REMEMBRANCES IN

354
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
WAYS LARGE AND SMALL.

355
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
YOU'VE ACTUALLY BEEN LOOKING AT

356
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
STUDIES ABOUT HOW KIDS IN THIS

357
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
AGE RANGE, YOUNG KIDS, DEAL WITH

358
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
WITNESSING A TRAUMATIC EVENT.

359
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, PTSD IS

360
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
SOMETHING WE TYPICALLY THINK OF

361
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
WITH ADULTS.

362
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THEM WITH

363
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
CHILDREN VERY MUCH AND CERTAINLY

364
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
CHILDREN THIS YOUNG.

365
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
IT EXISTS VERY MUCH SO THE WAY

366
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
THAT THEY -- THEIR BEHAVIOR IS

367
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
DIFFERENT.
THEY DON'T HAVE THE FLASHBACKS,

368
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
THE SORT OF HYPERVIGILANCE THAT

369
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
WE ASSOCIATE WITH PTSD.

370
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
OFTENTIMES YOU SEE IT IN THE WAY

371
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
THEY PLAY, SOMETIMES YOU SEE IT

372
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
IN THE WAY THAT THEY REGRESS.

373
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
THEY MAY START ACTING YOUNGER.

374
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
THEY MAY BE MORE CLINGY.

375
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
THEY MAY HAVE TEMPER TANTRUMS OR

376
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
BEHAVIOR THAT SEEMS OUT OF

377
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
SORTS.

378
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
OFTENTIMES, CAREGIVERS DON'T

379
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.

380
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
>> DOES IT SORT OF -- THE

381
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
TIMETABLE, DOES IT PLAY OUT

382
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
IMMEDIATELY OR IS IT SOMETHING

383
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
THAT SHOWS MONTHS LATER?
>> NO, IT OFTEN SHOWS UP VERY

384
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
EARLY.
THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT

385
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
BECAUSE IF YOU NOTICE IT EARLY,

386
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
THAT'S PRETTY NORMAL FOR BOTH

387
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
ADULTS AND CHILDREN ALIKE.

388
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
IF IT TURNS INTO NIGHTMARES,

389
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
ANXIETY OR LOSS OF SLEEP, THAT'S

390
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
WHEN USUALLY IT'S TIME TO TRY

391
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
AND MAYBE GET SOME HELP.

392
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE

393
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
BIT LAST NIGHT, ANDERSON.

394
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STUDY

395
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
SPECIFICALLY ON SLEEP, IT'S

396
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
COMPELLING STUFF.

397
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
IF SOMEBODY GETS GOOD SLEEP,

398
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
GOOD QUALITY SLEEP, YOU CAN

399
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
PREDICT MUCH MORE ACCURATELY HOW

400
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
WELL THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

401
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
COPE IN THE LONG RUN.

402
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
AND THAT SLEEP IN THE FIRST FEW

403
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
NIGHTS, LAST NIGHT, TONIGHT,

404
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
PARENTS WATCHING THEIR CHILD'S

405
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
SLEEP PATTERNS TONIGHT IS REALLY

406
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
IMPORTANT.

407
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
>> DEFINITELY FASCINATING.

408
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT A

409
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, I THINK IT

410
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
BEARS REPEATING BECAUSE I THINK

411
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
IT HAS CONCERNED A LOT OF

412
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
PARENTS, PARENTS WHOSE KIDS ARE

413
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
ON THE SPECTRUM OF AUTISM OR

414
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
HAVE ASPERGER'S.

415
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
YESTERDAY THERE HAD BEEN A QUOTE

416
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
FROM THE BROTHER OF THE SHOOTER

417
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
WHO THOUGHT HIS BROTHER HAD A

418
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
FORM OF AUTISM AND ALSO A

419
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
PERSONALITY DISORDER.
AUTISM IS NOT A PERSONALITY

420
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
DISORDER.
LET'S CLARIFY --

421
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
>> YES, AS YOU ALWAYS SAY, TERMS

422
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
DO MATTER HERE.
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AUTISM OR

423
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
ANYTHING ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM

424
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
AS THEY CALL IT, IT'S A

425
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER.

426
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN

427
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
THE BRAIN SINCE TIME OF BIRTH.

428
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
THAT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

429
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
THAN A PERSONALITY DISORDER OR

430
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
EVEN A MENTAL ILLNESS WHICH

431
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
COULD COME ON LATER IN LIFE.

432
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
BUT THE MORE CRUCIAL POINT IS

433
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
IT'S NOT ASSOCIATED WITH SORT OF

434
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
PLANNED VIOLENCE.

435
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
IT JUST ISN'T.

436
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
>> I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A YOUNG

437
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
PERSON WITH AUTISM COMMITTING A

438
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
PREPLANNED ACT OF VIOLENCE.

439
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
>> I HADN'T EITHER.

440
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
BUT I WENT AND LOOKED AT THE

441
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
STUDIES AGAIN.

442
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
THE STUDY THAT EVERYONE QUOTES

443
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
IS A STUDY OF ABOUT 132 PEOPLE,
THAT'S NOT A HUGE STUDY BUT IT'S

444
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
ONE OF THE BIGGEST STUDIES OUT

445
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
THERE.
OF THOSE 132, THERE WERE ONLY

446
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
THREE SORT OF EPISODES OF

447
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
VIOLENCE.
AS YOU MENTIONED, NONE OF THEM

448
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
PREPLANNED.

449
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
THERE'S NO LINK.

450
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I THINK I CAN SAFELY SAY THERE'S

451
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
NO LINK BETWEEN AUTISM SPECTRUM

452
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
AND PREPLANNED VIOLENCE.

453
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
WE CAN DISPEL THAT --

454
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
>> THERE ARE SO MANY KIDS WHO
ARE NOW DIAGNOSED SOMEWHERE ON

455
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
THE AUTISM SPECTRUM.

456
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF

457
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
PARENTS, OUTRAGED THAT PEOPLE

458
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
ARE USING THE TERM AUTISM AND
LINKING IT SOMEHOW TO THE

459
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
SHOOTING.

460
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
YOU JUST CLARIFIED --

461
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
>> I HOPE THEY'RE WATCHING.

462
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I THINK IT'S AN EDUCATIONAL

463
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
POINT.

464
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

465
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

466
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE KIND

467
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
OF -- WHAT SHOULD PARENTS BE
WATCHING FOR, DO YOU THINK, IN

468
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS?

469
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
>> I THINK THERE IS A -- THERE'S

470
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
A LOT OF NORMAL SORT OF GRIEF

471
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
THAT'S GOING ON.

472
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I THINK OBVIOUSLY WITH CHILDREN,

473
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SORT OF THE

474
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
THING -- IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

475
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
THE THINGS YOU MIGHT EXPECT.

476
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
ADULTS HAVE A MUCH BETTER WAY OF

477
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
VERBALIZING THESE THINGS.

478
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

479
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
PARENTS TO NOW AND A LOT OF

480
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
EXPERTS HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS.

481
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
BUT THIS IS NORMAL IN THE FIRST

482
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
FEW DAYS.

483
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF IT

484
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
PROGRESSES LONGER TERM, THEN

485
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
PEOPLE DO NEED TO GET HELP.

486
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
THERE IS HELP AVAILABLE HERE,
PHONE LINES BUT ALSO A GRIEF

487
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
CENTER AVAILABLE.

488
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
IF IT'S PERSISTENT, THAT HELP

489
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
NEEDS -- THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

490
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
THINKING OF MENTAL ILLNESS OR

491
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
THESE TYPES OF PROBLEMS WITH

492
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
PHYSICAL ILLNESS AS IT IS.

493
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
WE TEND TO PUT THESE THINGS IN

494
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
DIFFERENT BUCKETS.

495
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
THE IDEA THAT YOU THINK ABOUT

496
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
MENTAL ILLNESS AS YOU DO IN

497
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
CARDIAC DISEASE -- IT'S

498
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
STIGMATIZED.

499
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES.

500
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
WE TALK ABOUT IT IN SITUATIONS

501
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
LIKE THIS.

502
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
BUT HOPEFULLY IT WILL CATCH ON.

503
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
>> FOR PARENTS WHO HAVE A CHILD

504
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
WITH SOME SORT OF MENTAL

505
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
DISORDER -- AND THERE'S A LOT WE

506
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS SHOOTER.

507
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
BUT IN PAST CASES, IN THE

508
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
VIRGINIA TECH INSTANCE, PARENTS

509
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
TRIED TO GET HELP FOR THE CHILD

510
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
OR FOR THE YOUNG ADULT.

511
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
AND UNLESS THAT PERSON CAN BE

512
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
PROVED TO BE VIOLENT OR IS A

513
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
THREAT TO THEMSELVES OR SOMEBODY

514
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
ELSE, THEY OFTEN CAN'T GET HELP.

515
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

516
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
PARENTS CAN ANGUISH OVER THIS.

517
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
OFTENTIMES, THEY KNEW THE SIGNS

518
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
BUT COULDN'T GET HELP.

519
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
YOU MENTIONED VIRGINIA TECH,

520
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
THREE MONTHS LATER,

521
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
THREE-QUARTERS OF THE STUDENTS

522
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
STILL HAD SOME FORM OF PTSD.

523
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
THIS CAN LAST QUITE A LONG TIME.

524
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
>> THANK YOU, SANJAY.

525
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
A LOT MORE AHEAD.

526
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
WE'LL TAKE A SHORT BREAK.

527
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
YOUR COVERAGE CONTINUES FROM
HERE IN NEWTOWN.
ñç@RÑo

528
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
>>> IF YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING A
LOT OF COVERAGE OF THIS TRAGEDY,

529
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
YOU NO DOUBT KNOW THE NAME OF

530
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
THE SHOOTER BY NOW.

531
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
WE ARE NOT DURING THIS BROADCAST

532
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
USING THE NAME OF THE SHOOTER.

533
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW,

534
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
THERE'S NO NEED TO REPEAT IT

535
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

536
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
OFTEN IT SEEMS THAT IN HISTORY

537
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
REMEMBERS THE NAMES OF MURDERERS

538
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
AND NOT THE NAMES OF VICTIMS.

539
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
AND I THINK THAT'S -- I JUST

540
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
THINK THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE.

541
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT WE

542
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
CAN TO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT

543
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
NAME BEING OUT THERE AND BEING

544
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
KNOWN AS A HOUSEHOLD NAME FROM

545
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
HERE ON OUT.

546
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
WITNESSES TO THE SHOOTING

547
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
YESTERDAY SAY THAT THE FIRST

548
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
SHOTS RANG OUT AND JUST AS THE

549
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE BEING
READ AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

550
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
AND POLICE ARE TRYING TO HAMMER

551
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
DOWN EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
BEFORE THAT MOMENT.

552
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
TOM FOREMAN BREAKS IT DOWN FOR

553
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
US RIGHT NOW WITH WHAT

554
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
INVESTIGATORS KNOW SO FAR.

555
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
>> POLICE ARE ESSENTIALLY

556
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
CONSTRUCTING A MAP OF ALL OF THE

557
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
PLACES THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD

558
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
CONNECTIONS TO THIS SHOOTER.

559
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
FOR EXAMPLE, HIS BROTHER'S
APARTMENT DOWN HERE IN NEW

560
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
JERSEY ACROSS NEW YORK UP INTO

561
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
CONNECTICUT.

562
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE WHERE SHE WAS

563
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
FOUND DEAD.

564
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
ONLY ABOUT THREE MILES AWAY, OF
COURSE, THE SCHOOL.

565
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT LED

566
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
HIM TO THIS SPOT AT THAT TIME

567
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
BECAUSE THEY DO BELIEVE THAT
SHORTLY AFTER MURDERING HIS

568
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
MOTHER, HE DID DRIVE THE FEW

569
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
MILES FROM HER HOUSE TO THIS

570
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
SCHOOL AND EMERGE IN THIS

571
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
PARKING LOT WITH WEAPONS VERY

572
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
MUCH LIKE THESE TO GO INTO THE
SCHOOL.

573
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
NOW, LET'S LOOK AT THE TIME LINE

574
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
OF WHAT HAPPENED.

575
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO

576
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
RECONSTRUCT.

577
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
ABOUT 9:30 IN THE MORNING,

578
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
THAT'S WHEN WE BELIEVE BASED ON

579
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS AND POLICE

580
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
RADIO, THAT HE PROBABLY LEFT HIS

581
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
CAR, WE THINK THIS IS THE ONE
OVER HERE, BASED ON THE

582
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
INVESTIGATION, AND CAME UP TO

583
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL.
IT'S ALSO WHEN HE ENCOUNTERED

584
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
HIS FIRST OBSTACLE.

585
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
BECAUSE THESE SECURITY DOORS
WERE INSTALLED TO KEEP PEOPLE

586
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
OUT.
POLICE LATER SAID THE GLASS HAD

587
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
BEEN BROKEN OUT OF THESE.

588
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
THAT'S APPARENTLY HOW HE GOT
INTO THE SCHOOL WITH THOSE

589
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
WEAPONS.

590
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS BASED

591
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
ON POLICE REPORTS, BY 9:36, WE

592
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
HAD OUR FIRST CALLS INTO THE

593
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
POLICE STATION SAYING THAT

594
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
SHOOTING WAS OCCURRING INSIDE

595
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
THE SCHOOL AND, OF COURSE,

596
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
EVERYBODY WITHIN THE SCHOOL WAS
ALERTED TO THE SOUND OF THE

597
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
GUNFIRE.

598
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
IF THEY DIDN'T HEAR IT DIRECTLY,

599
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
THEY HEARD IT OVER THE P.A.

600
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
SYSTEM IN THIS SCHOOL WHERE

601
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE BEING MADE AT

602
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
THAT TIME.

603
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
THIS IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT, BY

604
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
9:38, 2 TO 2 1/2 MINUTES LATER,

605
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
POLICE WERE SAYING IF NOT ALL

606
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
THE SHOOTING, A BULK OF THE

607
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
SHOOTING WAS OVER, A VERY SHORT

608
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
PERIOD OF TIME IN A VERY SMALL

609
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
AREA WHERE IT ALL SEEMED TO

610
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
OCCUR.

611
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?

612
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
WELL, IT PROGRESSED EVEN
FURTHER.

613
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
BY ABOUT 9:40 IN THE MORNING,
POLICE WERE CALLING FOR

614
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIANS TO

615
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
COME THERE, FOR AMBULANCES TO

616
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
COME.

617
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
A FEW MINUTES LATER, THEY CALLED

618
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
FOR A WHOLE LOT MORE AMBULANCES

619
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
TO COME.

620
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
AND BY 9:50 OR SO IN THE

621
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
MORNING, THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY

622
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
SAYING THE SCENE WAS SECURE.

623
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
THEY HAD A SUSPECT WHO WAS DOWN.

624
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
THEY HAD CLEARED THE BUILDING.

625
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
THAT MANY OF THE CHILDREN WERE

626
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
BEING LED OUT, AS YOU CAN SEE IN

627
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
THIS PHOTOGRAPH FROM "THE
NEWTOWN BEE."

628
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
AND THAT THE SITUATION WAS MORE

629
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
OR LESS SECURE.

630
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
THERE IS STILL A LOT OF WORK TO

631
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
BE DONE OBVIOUSLY.

632
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, AS WE LOOK

633
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
AT THIS TIME LINE CLOSER AND

634
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
CLOSER, IT'S COMING DOWN TO A

635
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, 20
MINUTES OR LESS FROM THE

636
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
BEGINNING TO THE END OF THIS IN

637
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
TERMS OF PEOPLE REALLY KNOWING

638
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

639
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
AND NOW THIS HUGE, LONG, LONG

640
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
SEARCH TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT

641
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
HAPPENED.

642
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
ANDERSON?

643
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
>> TOM, THANKS VERY MUCH.

644
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
WE WANT TO GO TO OUR DAVID

645
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
ARIOSTO WHO'S IN THE

646
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE MOTHER OF

647
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
THIS SHOOTER LIVED.

648
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
DAVID, WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING

649
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
ABOUT THIS LADY?

650
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
>> ANDERSON, THIS IS WHERE THAT

651
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
FIRST MURDER TOOK PLACE BEFORE

652
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
THE SHOOTER HEADED OVER TO THAT
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

653
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
WE'VE TALKED TO NEIGHBORS IN AND

654
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
AROUND THE AREA HERE.

655
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
THEY PAINT A PICTURE OF A WOMAN

656
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
WHO WAS KILLED RIGHT BEFORE THAT

657
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
SHOOTING -- THEY DESCRIBE HER

658
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
SORT OF AS THIS PLEASURABLE

659
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
WOMAN, A WOMAN WHO WAS A VERY

660
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
PLEASANT PERSON TO BE AROUND.

661
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
SOMEONE WHO LOVED GARDENING,

662
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
LOVED LANDSCAPING, SOMEONE WHO

663
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
ATTENDED A MONTHLY DICE GAME

664
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
WITH MANY PEOPLE IN THE

665
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.

666
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
IT'S A TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY IN

667
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
THIS SOUTHWESTERN CONNECTICUT

668
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
TOWN.

669
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T REALLY

670
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
GET A SENSE OF IT NOW, IT IS ONE

671
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
OF THE MORE PICTURESQUE PLACES

672
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'M STANDING IN.

673
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
ROLLING GREEN HILLS AND QUITE AN

674
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOOD, TWO AND

675
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
THREE-STORY HOMES.

676
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
THE THINKING IS PEOPLE MOVED TO

677
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
THIS AREA BECAUSE OF THE SCHOOL

678
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
SYSTEMS.

679
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
SO IT STRIKES A PARTICULAR CHORD

680
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
THAT THIS OCCURRED WITHIN AN

681
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

682
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
BUT THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THAT

683
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
OTHER SIDE, THE TALK OF THIS

684
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
WOMAN, NANCY LANZA, WHO

685
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
COLLECTED GUNS, SOME

686
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
HIGH-POWERED WEAPONS AS IN THAT

687
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
BUSHMASTER THAT WAS USED IN THE

688
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING.

689
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER SHE

690
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
ATTENDED SOME OF THE SHOOTING

691
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
RANGES IN THE AREA ALTHOUGH WE

692
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
KNOW THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE

693
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
SHOOTING RANGES WITHIN A 20-MILE

694
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
RANGE OF THIS AREA.

695
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
ONE OF THE WORKERS THAT I SPOKE

696
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
TO AT A LOCAL BUSINESS HERE SAID

697
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
THAT SHE OFTEN SHOWED HER

698
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
RIFLE -- SHOWED A RIFLE THAT SHE

699
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
HAD RECENTLY PURCHASE AND EVEN

700
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
BROUGHT HER CHILDREN TARGET

701
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
SHOOTING.

702
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
NOT CLEAR IF THAT OCCURRED AT

703
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
THOSE RANGES OR JUST IN AND

704
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
AROUND THE AREA.

705
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
ATF AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS WE'VE

706
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
SPOKEN TO, FBI, SAID THAT THAT

707
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
DIDN'T OCCUR.

708
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
THERE'S REALLY QUITE A BIT OF

709
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
CONFLICTING INFORMATION AS TO

710
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
WHAT TRANSPIRED HERE.

711
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
BUT ONE NEIGHBOR PERHAPS SORT OF

712
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
SAID IT BEST.

713
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
SOMETHING JUST DOESN'T QUITE ADD

714
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
UP AS TO WHO THIS WOMAN WAS, WHY

715
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
SHE WAS KILLED AND WHAT

716
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
TRANSPIRED IN REALLY THE MINUTES

717
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
AFTER HER DEATH.

718
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
>> YEAH, SO MANY QUESTIONS STILL

719
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
UNANSWERED AT THIS POINT.

720
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
DAVID, APPRECIATE THE REPORTING.
WE'LL TAKE A SHORT BREAK.

721
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES IN A

722
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
MOMENT.

723
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
>>> IN THIS HOUR AND IN THE DAYS

724
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
AHEAD, WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS AS

725
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
MUCH AS WE CAN ON THE VICTIMS

726
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
AND LETTING YOU KNOW ABO THE

727
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
LIVES THEY LIVED, NOT JUST HOW

728
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
THEY LOST THEIR LIVES BUT THE

729
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
KIND OF LIVES THEY LIVED, WHO

730
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
THEY WERE.

731
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
AND TODAY WE'RE ABLE TO TELL YOU

732
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
MORE ABOUT THEM THAN WE WERE

733
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
YESTERDAY.

734
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
AND NO DOUBT TOMORROW WE'LL BE

735
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
ABLE TO TELL YOU EVEN MORE AS

736
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
FAMILY MEMBERS COME FORWARD AND

737
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
WANT TO SHARE THEIR GRIEF AND

738
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
WANT TO SHARE THEIR MEMORIES OF

739
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
THEIR LOVED ONES.

740
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
THOSE OF US FROM OUTSIDE ARE NOW

741
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE WOMEN

742
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
AND THE CHILDREN WHO LOST THEIR

743
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
LIVES ON FRIDAY AT SANDY HOOK

744
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

745
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
TAKE A LOOK.

746
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
>> VICTORIA SOTO'S FAMILY SAYS

747
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
SHE HAD HER STUDENTS HUDDLED

748
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
BEHIND HER TRYING TO PROTECT

749
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
THEM WHEN SHE WAS SHOT AND

750
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
KILLED AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

751
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
HER COUSIN SAYS THE HARDEST PART

752
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
WAS WAITING TO HEAR WHETHER SHE
HAD SURVIVED OR NOT.

753
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
>> AT THAT POINT, IT WAS THE

754
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
HARDEST FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY,

755
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
JUST THE WAITING GAME.

756
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
TO RECEIVE WORD ON WHAT HAPPENED

757
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
TO VICKI'S CLASS.

758
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
>> ALSO KILLED, LAUREN RUSSO,

759
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
HIRED JUST LAST MONTH AS A

760
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
PERMANENT SUBSTITUTE TEACHER.

761
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
HER FAMILY SAYS SHE ALWAYS

762
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
WANTED TO BE A TEACHER SINCE

763
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
BEFORE SHE EVEN WENT TO

764
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
KINDERGARTEN.

765
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST SAYS ON

766
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
HER WEB PAGE SHE HAS TWO

767
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
DAUGHTERS IN THEIR 20s, MARRIED

768
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
31 YEARS.

769
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
AND THE PRINCIPAL, DAWN

770
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
HOCHSPRUNG SAYING SHE WAS

771
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
EXCITED ABOUT TEACHING.

772
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
>> TO LOSE SOMEBODY LIKE THAT IN

773
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
OUR DISTRICT, IT'S SAD.

774
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
>> SHE WAS A PERSONAL FRIEND AND

775
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
A WONDERFUL LEADER.

776
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
>> SHE HAD RECENTLY OVERSEEN THE

777
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
INSTALLATION OF A NEW SECURITY

778
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
SYSTEM REQUIRING EVERY VISITOR

779
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
AFTER 9:30 A.M. TO GET BUZZED IN

780
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
AND SHOW ID.

781
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
>> SHE TRULY DID BELIEVE IN

782
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

783
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
CHILDREN FELT SAFE.

784
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY THE

785
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
TRAGIC IRONY OF THIS ENTIRE

786
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
SITUATION.

787
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
>> SHE WAS ALSO A PARENT

788
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
HERSELF, RAISING TWO DAUGHTERS

789
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
AND THREE STEPDAUGHTERS.

790
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
FRIENDS AND PARENTS SAY

791
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
HOCHSPRUNG WAS PASSIONATE AND

792
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
DEDICATED, TOUGH BUT CARING AND

793
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
ONE SAID THE KIDS LOVED HER.

794
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
>> THE PRINCIPAL WHO, GOD BLESS

795
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
HER, LOST HER LIFE, WAS JUST A

796
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
VERY SPECIAL PERSON AND ALL THE

797
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
PARENTS KNEW THAT.

798
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
>> WOLF BLITZER, CNN, NEWTOWN,

799
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
CONNECTICUT.

800
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
>> AT ONE POINT EARLIER TONIGHT,

801
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
A MAN STEPPED FORWARD BEFORE

802
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
CAMERAS TO PAY AN INCREDIBLY

803
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
LOVING TRIBUTE TO HIS OWN
DAUGHTER, EMILIE PARKER WAS JUST

804
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
6 YEARS OLD.

805
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
SHE WAS ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS

806
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
KILLED YESTERDAY.

807
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
HER FATHER, ROBBIE PARKER, SAID
HE IS EVEN PRAYING FOR THE

808
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
SHOOTER'S FAMILY.

809
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
WATCH.
>> I'D REALLY LIKE TO OFFER OUR

810
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO THE

811
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
FAMILIES WHO WERE DIRECTLY

812
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
AFFECTED BY THIS SHOOTING.

813
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
IT'S AN HORRIFIC TRAGEDY AND WE

814
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT OUR

815
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO OUT TO
THEM.

816
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THIS INCLUDES THE FAMILY OF THE

817
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
SHOOTER.

818
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD THIS

819
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
EXPERIENCE MUST BE FOR YOU AND I

820
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR FAMILY

821
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
AND OUR LOVE AND OUR SUPPORT

822
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
GOES OUT TO YOU AS WELL.

823
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
MY DAUGHTER, EMILIE, WOULD BE

824
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE

825
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
STANDING AND GIVING HER LOVE AND

826
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
SUPPORT TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS

827
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF

828
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
PERSON THAT SHE IS, NOT BECAUSE

829
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
OF ANY PARENTING THAT MY WIFE

830
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
AND I COULD HAVE DONE, BUT

831
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE GIFTS

832
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY HER

833
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
HEAVENLY FATHER.

834
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I HAVE TWO REALLY GOOD FRIENDS

835
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
AT HOME WHO HAVE SET UP A

836
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
FACEBOOK PAGE TO HELP RAISE
MONEY FOR EMILIE.

837
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
WHEN I'VE GOTTEN ON THAT AND

838
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
SEEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

839
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
HAVE COMMENTED AND EXPRESSED

840
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
THEIR CONDOLENCES, IT'S BEEN

841
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
QUITE OVERWHELMING.

842
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

843
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

844
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

845
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

846
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
WAS AND HOW MANY LIVES THAT SHE

847
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
WAS ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT

848
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
TIME HERE ON EARTH.

849
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

850
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
VERY LOVING.

851
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
EMILIE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO TRY

852
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
NEW THINGS, OTHER THAN FOOD.

853
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
SHE LOVED TO USE HER TALENTS TO

854
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
TOUCH THE LIVES OF EVERYONE THAT

855
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
SHE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH.

856
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
SHE WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL ARTIST

857
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
AND SHE ALWAYS CARRIED AROUND

858
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
HER MARKERS AND PENCILS SO SHE

859
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
NEVER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO

860
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
DRAW A PICTURE OR MAKE A CARD

861
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
FOR THOSE AROUND HER.

862
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF

863
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
TIMES EMILIE NOTICED SOMEONE

864
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
FEELING SAD OR FRUSTRATED AND

865
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
WOULD RUSH TO FIND A PIECE OF

866
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
PAPER TO DRAW THEM A PICTURE OR

867
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
TO WRITE THEM AN ENCOURAGING

868
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
NOTE.

869
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
EMILIE'S CARD MAKING WAS

870
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
EXPRESSED BEAUTIFULLY THIS LAST

871
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
OCTOBER WHEN SHE PLACED A VERY

872
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
SPECIAL CARD SHE HAD MADE INTO

873
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
THE CASKET WITH HER GRANDPA, WHO

874
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
ALSO JUST RECENTLY DIED OF A

875
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
TRAGIC ACCIDENT.

876
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER TWO

877
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
LITTLE SISTERS AND DELIGHTED IN

878
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ, DANCE

879
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS IN

880
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
LIFE.

881
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
EMILIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS

882
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE

883
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
PLEASURE TO MEET HER WOULD AGREE

884
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
THAT THIS WORLD IS A BETTER

885
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
PLACE BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN IN IT.

886
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
SHE WAS THEIR BEST FRIEND.

887
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
THEY WERE ALL BORN WITHIN THREE

888
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
YEARS OF EACH OTHER SO BY LAW,

889
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE.

890
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
SHE WAS TEACHING MY MIDDLE

891
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
DAUGHTER TO READ.

892
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
SHE WOULD HELP MY YOUNGEST

893
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
DAUGHTER LEARN HOW TO MAKE

894
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
THINGS, SHOW HER HOW TO DO

895
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
CRAFTS.

896
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
THEY LOOKED UP TO HER AND THEY

897
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
LOOKED TO HER WHEN THEY NEEDED

898
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
COMFORT.

899
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
USUALLY THAT'S SAVED FOR A MOM

900
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
AND A DAD.

901
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
BUT IT WAS REALLY SWEET TO SEE

902
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
THE TIMES WHEN ONE OF THEM WOULD

903
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
FALL OR GET THEIR FEELINGS HURT,

904
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
HOW THEY WOULD RUN TO EMILIE TO

905
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
GET SUPPORT AND HUGS AND KISSES.

906
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT

907
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
COULD JUST LIGHT UP A ROOM.

908
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING KIND TO

909
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
SAY ABOUT ANYBODY.

910
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
AND HER LOVE AND THE STRENGTH

911
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
THAT SHE GAVE US AND THE EXAMPLE

912
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
THAT SHE SHOWED TO US IS

913
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
REMARKABLE.

914
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON.

915
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
AND I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER

916
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
DAD.

917
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I WAS LEAVING TO WORK AND SHE

918
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT.

919
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
AND I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TEACHING
HER PORTUGUESE.

920
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
SO OUR LAST CONVERSATION WAS IN

921
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
PORTUGUESE.

922
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
AND SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING.

923
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

924
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I SAID THAT I WAS DOING WELL.

925
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME.

926
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT

927
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
THE DOOR.

928
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
FREE AGENCY IS GIVEN TO ALL OF

929
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
US TO ACT AND DO WHAT WE WANT.

930
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM

931
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
US.

932
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

933
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
THAT HE WAS GIVEN AND THAT'S

934
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
WHAT HE CHOSE TO DO WITH IT.
I KNOW THAT GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT

935
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
AWAY.

936
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I'M NOT MAD BECAUSE I HAVE MY
AGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT I USE

937
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
THIS EVENT TO DO WHAT I CAN TO

938
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
DO WHATEVER I CAN.

939
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY

940
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
FAMILY AND MY WIFE AND MY

941
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
DAUGHTERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF AND

942
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
THAT IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I

943
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
CAN DO TO HELP ANYBODY AT ANY
TIME, ANYWHERE, I'D BE WILLING

944
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
TO DO THAT.

945
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT HAPPENED

946
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO SO MANY

947
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN INTO

948
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US, BUT

949
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US TO BE

950
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
BETTER, TO BE MORE COMPASSIONATE
AND MORE HUMBLE PEOPLE.

951
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
>> A FATHER IN MOURNING SPEAKING

952
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
OF COMPASSION FOR OTHERS.

953
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT SCHOOL IS

954
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
SADLY JUST THE LATEST ON A LONG

955
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
LIST OF VIOLENT ATTACKS WITH

956
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
GUNS OVER THE YEARS.

957
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
WHEN WE FIRST HEARD WHAT

958
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
HAPPENED IN CONNECTICUT, PEOPLE

959
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
PROBABLY THOUGHT ABOUT THE OTHER

960
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
DEADLY SHOOTINGS.

961
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
JOINING ME NOW IS PASTOR ROCKY

962
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
VEACH WHO WAS LIVING NEAR

963
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
LITTLETON, COLORADO, WHEN THE

964
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
COLUMBINE ATTACK OCCURRED.

965
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY FOR FAMILIES WHO
COME TO YOU AND PEOPLE IN THIS

966
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
COMMUNITY WHO WEREN'T EVEN

967
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
HAVING A LOVED ONE AT THAT

968
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
SCHOOL BUT WHO JUST -- EVERYBODY

969
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
FEELS AFFECTED.

970
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

971
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
>> YEAH, AS A CHRISTIAN, WHAT

972
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
CAN YOU SAY TO START WITH?

973
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
BUT AS A CHRISTIAN, YOU TELL
THEM, THERE'S HOPE IN THE LORD.

974
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
GOD KNOWS WHERE YOU'RE AT.

975
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
GOD CARES FOR YOU AND LOVES YOU.

976
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
RATHER THAN SAYING A LOT ABOUT
JESUS, TRYING TO BE LIKE JESUS.

977
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
>> IT SEEMS, TOO, A LOT OF TIMES

978
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
JUST BEING THERE IS IMPORTANT

979
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
AND LISTENING IS AS IMPORTANT AS

980
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
WHAT YOU SAY.

981
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
>> YEAH, VERY MUCH SO.

982
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
THAT'S WHAT ANYBODY NEEDS IN

983
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
THIS KIND OF SETTING.

984
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
AND HAVING BEEN IN THIS SETTING

985
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
A TIME BEFORE, AND ACTUALLY I'M

986
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
GLAD TO BE AROUND TO BE ABLE TO

987
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
HELP PEOPLE HERE.

988
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
>> YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN THE

989
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME.
>> YEAH, RIGHT PLACE AT THE

990
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
RIGHT TIME.

991
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
AND THE CHURCH THAT I PASTOR, I

992
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
THINK THEY FEEL THAT WAY, TOO.

993
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
WE'VE BEEN CONDUCTING PRAYER

994
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
MEETINGS IN THE AREA, PRAYING

995
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
FOR PEOPLE.

996
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
AND GETTING IN TOUCH WITH GOD

997
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
AND ASKING HIM TO HELP THEM AND

998
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
HELP USE US IN WAYS THAT CAN BE

999
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
HELPFUL TOWARD OTHER PEOPLE.

1000
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
>> IT IS EXTRAORDINARY -- I'VE

1001
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
SPENT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME IN

1002
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
THIS TOWN.

1003
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
JUST TO SEE HOW PEOPLE ARE
COMING TOGETHER.

1004
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
PEOPLE ARE STOPPING HERE, PEOPLE

1005
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
ARE STOPPING DOWN THE STREET AND

1006
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
JUST KIND OF TALKING TO ONE

1007
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
ANOTHER, COMPLETE STRANGERS KIND

1008
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
OF REACHING OUT TO ONE ANOTHER

1009
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
IN GRIEF AND IN SADNESS.

1010
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
>> YEAH, I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1011
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING IN ALL OF

1012
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
US THAT CAN HELP ALLEVIATE THE

1013
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
PAIN WHEN WE GO THROUGH A CRISIS

1014
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
SITUATION.

1015
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
WE NEED EACH OTHER AND THAT'S

1016
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS

1017
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
ABOUT COMMUNITY.

1018
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
>> DO YOU ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO

1019
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
TALK ABOUT IT?

1020
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I LOST A BROTHER YEARS AGO TO

1021
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
SUICIDE.

1022
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
AND MY MOM FOUND IT HELPFUL TO

1023
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
TALK ABOUT IT OVER AND OVER

1024
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
AGAIN.
AND I FOUND IT VERY, VERY

1025
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
DIFFICULT AND EVEN STILL TO THIS

1026
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
DAY.

1027
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
DO YOU ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TALK?

1028
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
>> I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TALK

1029
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
ABOUT IT.

1030
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
AND I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TALK

1031
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
TO THE LORD ABOUT IT.

1032
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
SOMETIMES WE FORGET THAT WE CAN

1033
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
TALK TO GOD, TALK TO HIM

1034
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
DIRECTLY.

1035
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
AND HE UNDERSTANDS IN A WAY THAT

1036
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
A PERSON REALLY CAN'T.

1037
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
AGAIN, EVERYTHING I'M ABOUT IS

1038
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
LOOKING TO HIM.

1039
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
>> THERE ARE NO DOUBT PEOPLE WHO

1040
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
WITNESS WHAT HAPPENED AND

1041
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
QUESTION FAITH, QUESTION HOW CAN

1042
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
THIS HAPPEN -- HOW CAN THIS BE

1043
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
ALLOWED TO HAPPEN?

1044
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
HOW DO YOU ANSWER?

1045
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
>> THAT'S THE AGE-OLD QUESTION.

1046
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I LOOK AT EVIL -- TO BELIEVE IN

1047
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
EVIL, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN

1048
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
GOOD.

1049
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I GO BACK TO THE STORY OF

1050
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
CREATION.

1051
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
GOD'S THE CREATOR AND THERE IS

1052
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
AN ADVERSARY, THERE IS AN ENEMY.

1053
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
GOD'S NOT THE AUTHOR OF THIS.

1054
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
THE BIBLE SAYS THAT GOD IS THE

1055
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
AUTHOR OF ABUNDANT LIFE.

1056
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
THE DEVIL IS THE AUTHOR OF THIS

1057
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
KIND OF LIFE.

1058
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
HE COMES TO STEAL, KILL AND

1059
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
DESTROY.

1060
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
IT'S SAD.

1061
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
BUT GOD IS BIGGER THAN THAT.

1062
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
THAT'S WHY WE POINT PEOPLE
TOWARDS HIM IN THIS KIND OF

1063
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
SCENARIO.

1064
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
>> AND FAITH GETS YOU THROUGH?

1065
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
>> FAITH GETS YOU THROUGH.

1066
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I THINK PEOPLE FIND THAT FAITH

1067
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
GETS THEM THROUGH A LOT OF

1068
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT THINK

1069
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
IT WILL AT THE TIME.

1070
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
HAVING LIVED IN COLUMBINE, I SAW

1071
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
THIS ONCE BEFORE -- OR IN DENVER
DURING COLUMBINE, SAW THIS ONCE

1072
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
BEFORE.

1073
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
IT'S AMAZING.

1074
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
CHANGED MY LIFE WATCHING HOW

1075
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
OTHER PEOPLE -- HOW GOD DID HELP

1076
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
THEM AND DID GET THEM THROUGH

1077
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
TIMES WHEN THEY THOUGHT THEY
WOULDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH.

1078
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
>> AND TO SEE PARENTS -- TO SEE

1079
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
MR. PARKER SPEAKING ABOUT HIS

1080
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
DAUGHTER, THE STRENGTH THAT

1081
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
TAKES, THE STRENGTH THAT TAKES

1082
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
JUST TO GET THROUGH MINUTE BY
MINUTE, SECOND BY SECOND.

1083
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
>> YEAH.

1084
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
NO, THAT WAS VERY TOUCHING

1085
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
THERE.

1086
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
IT'S JUST A HORRIBLE SCENARIO, A

1087
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
HORRIBLE SITUATION.

1088
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
LIKE WE SAID IN THE BEGINNING,

1089
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
WORDS CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING
IN THIS.

1090
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
HOW CAN I UNDERSTAND HIM?

1091
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I JUST TRY TO LOVE HIM AND BE

1092
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
THERE FOR HIM AND PEOPLE LIKE

1093
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
HIM, BE THERE IN THE COMMUNITY.

1094
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
>> SOMETIMES THE WORDS SEEM --

1095
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
THEY FEEL SO SMALL IN A

1096
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS.

1097
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
PASTOR, APPRECIATE YOU BEING ON.

1098
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1099
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
>> THERE'S STILL A LOT FOR US TO

1100
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
LEARN IN THE DAYS AHEAD AND AS

1101
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES.

1102
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
WE'LL TAKE A SHORT BREAK.

1103
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
WE'LL CONTINUE REMEMBERING THE

1104
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
VICTIMS TONIGHT WHEN WE COME

1105
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
BACK.

1106
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
>>> THIS IS A VERY, VERY TRAGIC,

1107
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
TRAGIC SCENE FOR EVERYBODY.

1108
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
CERTAINLY OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN

1109
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
FOR THE FAMILIES HERE.

1110
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, ABOUT 9:30,

1111
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
9:40, WE HEARD NOISES.

1112
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM WAS

1113
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
STILL ON.

1114
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
SO IT DIDN'T GO OFF.

1115
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
SO YOU COULD HEAR WHAT SOUNDED

1116
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
LIKE POPS, GUNSHOTS.

1117
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
>> HER TEACHER MANAGED TO TAKE

1118
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
TWO CHILDREN OUT OF THE HALLWAY,

1119
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
PULL THEM INTO THE CLASSROOM,

1120
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
LOCK THE DOOR AND MOVE EVERYBODY

1121
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

1122
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
ROOM.

1123
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
>> WE JUST TOLD A LITTLE BOY

1124
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
ABOUT HIS SISTER NOW.

1125
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
HE SAID, WHO AM I GOING TO PLAY

1126
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
WITH NOW?

1127
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I HAVE NOBODY TO PLAY WITH NOW.

1128
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
EXCUSE ME.

1129
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
>> WHEN YOUR FIRST-GRADER GOES

1130
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
TO BED AND SAYS, MOMMY, IS

1131
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
ANYONE FROM MY CLASS LAST

1132
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
YEAR -- ARE THEY ALL OKAY?

1133
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
AND YOU LOOK AT THEM AND SAY,

1134
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

1135
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
>> YOU CAN NEVER BE PREPARED FOR

1136
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
THIS KIND OF INCIDENT.

1137
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
WHAT HAS HAPPENED, WHAT HAS

1138
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
TRANSPIRED AT THAT SCHOOL

1139
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
BUILDING WILL LEAVE A MARK ON

1140
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
THIS COMMUNITY AND EVERY FAMILY

1141
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
IMPACTED.

1142
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
>> AS I'VE BEEN SAYING SINCE THE

1143
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
BEGINNING OF OUR COVERAGE, WE

1144
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
WANT TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE

1145
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
VICTIMS, ON THE LIVES THEY
LIVED.

1146
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
AND WE WANT TODAY TO TRY TO

1147
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
LEARN AS MUCH AS WE CAN ABOUT

1148
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
THEM AND IN THE DAYS AHEAD, TO

1149
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
LEARN AS MUCH AS WE CAN ABOUT

1150
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
THEM AS WHEN THEIR FAMILIES WANT

1151
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
THAT INFORMATION OUT.

1152
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T HAVE

1153
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
PICTURES OF MANY OF THE VICTIMS.
WE'RE WAITING OF COURSE FOR

1154
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
FAMILIES TO RELEASE THAT IF AND

1155
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
WHEN THEY CHOOSE TO.
BUT WE DO HAVE THEIR NAMES

1156
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
TONIGHT.
AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE A FEW

1157
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
MOMENTS AND JUST READ YOU THEIR

1158
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
NAMES SO THAT YOU REMEMBER THEIR
NAMES.

1159
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
SO OFTEN WE REMEMBER THE NAMES

1160
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
OF THE SHOOTERS IN THESE KIND OF

1161
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
SITUATIONS.

1162
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

1163
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
REMEMBER THE NAMES OF THE

1164
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
VICTIMS INSTEAD.

1209
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
A VIGIL IN MAIN STREET HERE IN

1210
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
NEWTOWN.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A SHORT

1211
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
BREAK AND BE BACK IN A MOMENT.

1212
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
>>> THE SHOOTING IN NEWTOWN IS

1213
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
NOW IF SECOND DEADLIEST SCHOOL

1214
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
SHOOTING IN U.S. HISTORY BEHIND
THE VIRGINIA TECH MASSACRE IN

1215
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
2007.

1216
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
AFTER EVERY EVENT LIKE THIS, THE

1217
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
QUESTIONS ALWAYS ARE THE SAME,

1218
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
WHAT CAUSES THIS KIND OF A

1219
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
SHOOTING?

1220
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN?

1221
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
HOW CAN THEY BE STOPPED?

1222
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I'M JOINED NOW BY KATHERINE

1223
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
NEWMAN FROM BALTIMORE WHO WROTE

1224
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
THE BOOK "RAMPAGE, THE SOCIAL

1225
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
ROOTS OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS" SHE'S

1226
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
STUDIED MANY OF THESE KINDS OF

1227
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
EVENTS.

1228
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I'VE READ A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

1229
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
YOUR RESEARCH.

1230
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT

1231
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
THESE SHOOTINGS THAT ARE SORT OF

1232
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
COUNTERINTUITIVE?

1233
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
PEOPLE THINK THEY KNOW WHAT

1234
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
CAUSES THEM AT TIMES ABOUT THE

1235
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
COLUMBINE.

1236
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
BUT SO MANY OF THE THINGS WE

1237
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
THOUGHT WE KNEW ABOUT COLUMBINE

1238
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
HAVE TURNED OUT NOT TO BE TRUE.

1239
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
WHAT DO WE NOW KNOW ABOUT WHAT

1240
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
CAUSES THESE KINDS OF EVENTS?

1241
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
>> THAT'S SO TRUE.

1242
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
SOME OF THE COMMON MYTHS ARE

1243
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
THAT THESE THINGS ARE

1244
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
SPONTANEOUS.

1245
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
THEY'RE ALMOST NEVER

1246
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
SPONTANEOUS.

1247
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
SOME OF THE SHOOTINGS WE STUDIED
WERE PLANNED OVER A NINE-MONTH

1248
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
PERIOD.

1249
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
SADLY IN MANY INSTANCES, THERE

1250
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
ARE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE

1251
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
AN INKLING.

1252
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
IN SOME OF THE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS

1253
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
WE STUDIED, THERE WERE CHILDREN

1254
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
WHO DIDN'T COME TO SCHOOL THAT

1255
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
DAY BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED

1256
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN

1257
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
BUT SADLY THEY NEVER TOLD ANYONE

1258
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
WHO COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING.

1259
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
AND SO ONE OF THE

1260
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
COUNTERINTUITIVE THINGS WE

1261
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
LEARNED WAS THAT THERE'S A LOT

1262
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
OF INFORMATION OFTEN CIRCULATING

1263
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
BUT IT DOESN'T GET TO THE RIGHT
PLACE.

1264
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WAS TRUE IN
THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE.

1265
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
IT WILL TAKE TIME BEFORE WE KNOW

1266
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
ENOUGH TO GENERALIZE TO IT.

1267
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
BUT IN THE STUDIES WE STUDIED --

1268
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
AND WE STUDIED ALL OF THEM FROM

1269
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
THE 1970s ONWARD IN THE UNITED

1270
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
STATES, IT WAS FREQUENTLY THE

1271
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
CASE THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF

1272
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
KNOWLEDGE IN PEER COMMUNITIES

1273
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
THAT DIDN'T GET THROUGH TO THE

1274
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
ADULTS IN TIME TO DO ANYTHING
ABOUT IT.

1275
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT IT

1276
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
FREQUENTLY HAPPENS IN TOWNS JUST

1277
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
LIKE NEWTOWN, SMALL, RURAL

1278
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
SETTINGS, NOT THE PLACES THAT WE

1279
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
THINK OF AS CHARACTERISTICALLY

1280
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
VIOLENT.

1281
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
WE THINK OF BIG CITIES AS PLACES

1282
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
WHERE THERE'S GUN VIOLENCE.

1283
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
AND OF COURSE THERE IS.

1284
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
BUT THESE KINDS OF SHOOTINGS

1285
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
DON'T HAPPEN IN BIG CITIES.

1286
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
THEY HAPPEN USUALLY IN SMALL

1287
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
TOWNS OR SUBURBS.

1288
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
>> AND IS THERE A COMMON THREAD

1289
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
IN THE MENTAL HEALTH HISTORY OF

1290
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
THE BOYS INVOLVED IN THESE?

1291
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
>> THERE IS ALMOST ALWAYS A

1292
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION.

1293
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
THE SAD THING IS IT'S OFTEN

1294
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
UNRECOGNIZED AND UNTREATED.

1295
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
SO WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL BE

1296
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
TRUE IN THIS CASE.

1297
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
BUT IN MOST OF THE CASES WE

1298
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
LOOKED AT, THERE WAS

1299
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
AFTER-THE-FACT EVIDENCE OF

1300
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,000
MENTAL DISORDERS BUT NO

1301
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
TREATMENT.
THAT'S DISTURBING BECAUSE WE

1302
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
LIKE TO THINK WE CAN RECOGNIZE

1303
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
THE SYMPTOMS.

1304
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
BUT PARTICULARLY WHEN THE

1305
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
SHOOTERS ARE YOUNGER THAN THIS

1306
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
ONE, THE ONES WE LOOKED AT WERE

1307
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
13, 12, THE SIGNS OF

1308
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
DISTINGUISHED MENTAL ILLNESS

1309
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
THAT ARE GOING TO BE SO VIVID IF

1310
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
THEY SURVIVE INTO THEIR 20s ARE

1311
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
NOT SO EASY TO DISCERN WHEN

1312
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
THEY'RE 13.

1313
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
SO SADLY THERE IS A -- THERE'S

1314
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
EVIDENCE AFTER THE FACT OFTEN

1315
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
THAT COMES UP IN FORENSIC

1316
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
EXAMINATIONS, BUT NOT THE KIND

1317
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
OF EVIDENCE THAT LEADS TO THE

1318
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
TREATMENT THAT THEY SO
DESPERATELY NEED.

1319
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
>> IT'S ALSO INTERESTING IN THE

1320
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
BOOK TITLE, YOU TALK ABOUT THE

1321
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
SOCIAL ROOTS OF THESE SHOOTINGS.

1322
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
OFTENTIMES THE IDEAS THAT THESE

1323
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
ARE LONERS ON THE FRINGE.

1324
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
BUT YOU'VE FOUND IT'S NOT THAT

1325
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
SIMPLE.

1326
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
>> NO.

1327
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
SADLY THEY ARE RARELY LONERS.

1328
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
IT'S MORE CHARACTERISTIC TO SAY

1329
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
THEY'RE FAILED JOINERS.

1330
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

1331
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
TYPICALLY TRIED TO JOIN GROUPS

1332
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
AND ARE REBUFFED AND REJECTED.

1333
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
SO THEIR EXPERIENCE IS NOT THAT

1334
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
OF BEING A LONER.

1335
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
IT'S OF BEING PUSHED ASIDE AND

1336
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
MADE TO FEEL REJECTED.

1337
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
AND SO WHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS

1338
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
WITH THESE YOUNG MEN IS THAT

1339
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
THEY GO THROUGH A WHOLE SERIES

1340
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
OF EFFORTS TO TRY AND GET

1341
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
ATTENTION AND INGRATIATE

1342
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
THEMSELVES IN GROUPS.

1343
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
ALL THOSE EFFORTS FAIL AND THEY
START TALKING ABOUT SHOOTING

1344
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
PEOPLE AND SUDDENLY EVERYONE'S

1345
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
PAYING ATTENTION.

1346
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
SO THEY'RE TRYING TO CHANGE HOW

1347
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THEM AND

1348
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
NOTORIOUS AND EVIL SEEMS BETTER

1349
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
TO THEM THAN A LOSER.

1350
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
>> IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I

1351
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
BELIEVE JUST IN NOT TRYING TO

1352
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
MENTION THEIR NAMES BECAUSE JUST

1353
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY CAN

1354
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN GAME FAME

1355
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
OR NOTORIETY BY DOING THIS, I

1356
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
JUST DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD TO

1357
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
PERPETUATE THAT.

1358
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I FIND YOUR RESEARCH REALLY

1359
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
FASCINATING.

1360
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I'D LOVE TO TALK TO YOU MORE IN

1361
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
THE DAYS AHEAD.
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.

1362
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
>> MY PLEASURE, ANDERSON.
>> SOME MEMORIES ARE SEARED INTO

1363
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
OUR MINDS NO MATTER HOW MUCH ONE

1364
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
WANTS TO FORGET THEM.

1365
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
THE NEWTOWN SHOOTING NO DOUBT

1366
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY FOR ONE

1367
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
OF THE SCHOOL'S TEACHERS.

1368
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
YET IN THE MIDST OF A CRISIS,

1369
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
SHE STAYED REMARKABLY CALM FOR

1370
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
HER KINDERGARTEN STUDENTS.

1371
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I TALKED TO HER, JANET VOLLMER

1372
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
IS HER NAME.

1373
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I WANT YOU TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAID

1374
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
ABOUT HOW SHE GOT HERSELF
THROUGH THIS CRISIS.

1375
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
LISTEN.

1376
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
>> ABOUT 9:30, 9:40, WE HEARD

1377
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
NOISES.

1378
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM WAS

1379
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
STILL ON.

1380
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
SO IT DIDN'T GO OFF.

1381
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
SO YOU COULD HEAR WHAT SOUNDED

1382
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
LIKE POPS, GUNSHOTS.

1383
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
OF COURSE I'M NOT GOING TO TELL

1384
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
THAT TO 5-YEAR-OLDS.

1385
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
SO I SAID TO THEM, WE'RE GOING

1386
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
OVER IN A SAFE AREA AND WE'RE

1387
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
GOING TO -- WE READ A STORY AND

1388
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
WE KEPT THEM CALM.

1389
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
DID A LOCKDOWN DRILL, CLOSED THE
DOORS, LOCKED -- COVERED THE

1390
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
WINDOWS.

1391
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
KEPT THE CHILDREN WITH US.

1392
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I HAVE OTHER ADULTS --

1393
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
>> I FIND THAT AMAZING THAT

1394
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
FEARING THAT YOU HEAR GUNSHOTS,

1395
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
YOU WERE ABLE TO HAVE THE

1396
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
COMPOSURE TO SIT DOWN AND READ

1397
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
TO YOUR STUDENTS.

1398
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.

1399
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

1400
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
WITH 5-YEAR-OLDS BECAUSE YOU

1401
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
CAN'T LOSE IT.

1402
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG

1403
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
TIME.

1404
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
IT'S MY 18th YEAR OF TEACHING.

1405
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
MY JOB WAS TO KEEP THEM SAFE.

1406
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I DIDN'T KNOW -- THERE WAS NO

1407
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
ANNOUNCEMENT OF WHAT WAS GOING
ON.

1408
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
MY INSTINCT WAS IT WASN'T GOOD.

1409
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
SO WE KEPT THEM CALM.

1410
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
WE STAYED IN THE ROOM UNTIL

1411
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
THERE WAS BANGING AT THE DOOR,

1412
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
WHICH WERE THE POLICE AND THE

1413
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
TROOPERS OR WHOEVER WAS THERE.

1414
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
THEY HAD US EXIT THE BUILDING.

1415
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
THEY TOLD THE CHILDREN TO COVER

1416
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
THEIR EYES AND WALK IN A LINE

1417
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
AND LEAVE THE BUILDING AND

1418
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
THAT'S WHEN WE WENT DOWN TOWARDS

1419
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
THE FIREHOUSE.

1420
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
WE WERE ALL SAFE.

1421
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I HAD 19 CHILDREN IN THE ROOM

1422
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
WITH ME AND THANK GOODNESS ALL

1423
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
OF THEIR PARENTS WERE ABLE TO

1424
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
COME AND PICK THEM UP AND TAKE

1425
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
THEM HOME.

1426
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
>> AS YOU WERE READING TO THEM,

1427
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
DID THE KIDS REALIZE SOMETHING

1428
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
WAS GOING ON OR DID THEY JUST

1429
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
THINK IT WAS A DRILL LIKE YOU'D

1430
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
HAD BEFORE?

1431
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
>> RIGHT.

1432
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
IT DIDN'T SEEM A NATURAL THING.

1433
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
ALTHOUGH WE DO PRACTICE DRILLS.

1434
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
WE JUST SAID, WELL, WE'RE NOT

1435
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
REALLY SURE BUT WE'RE GOING TO

1436
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
BE SAFE BECAUSE WE'RE SITTING

1437
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
OVER HERE AND WE'RE ALL

1438
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
TOGETHER.

1439
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
AND THAT'S AS WE GOT DOWN TO THE

1440
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
FIREHOUSE LATER ON, AS A LOT OF

1441
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
THE EVENTS STARTED TO UNFOLD

1442
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY, I THINK SOME

1443
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
OF THEM REALIZED THE MAGNITUDE

1444
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.

1445
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
THEY SAW OTHER PEOPLE UPSET.

1446
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
BUT WE JUST HELD THEM CLOSE

1447
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
UNTIL THEIR PARENTS CAME AND WE

1448
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
RELEASED THEM.

1449
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
MY ROOM, MY CHILDREN WERE ALL

1450
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
ACCOUNTED FOR AND SAFE IN MY

1451
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM.
>> WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE

1452
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
KIDS DEALING WITH THE POTENTIAL

1453
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
FOR PTSD.
ALSO FIRST RESPONDERS DEALING

1454
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
WITH THE STRESS IN ALL OF THIS
AND WHAT THEY'VE HAD TO SEE.

1455
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
TERRY LYLES DEALS WITH STRESS

1456
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT.

1457
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
HE JOINS ME FROM MIAMI.

1458
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
IT IS EASY TO FORGET THESE

1459
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
SCENES ARE PROBABLY THE WORST

1460
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
MANY OF THESE EMERGENCY WORKERS

1461
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
HAVE EVER WITNESSED.

1462
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE THINGS THEY

1463
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
SAW IN THOSE SCHOOLS -- IN THAT

1464
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
SCHOOL.

1465
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
YOU HELP RESCUE WORKERS DEAL

1466
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
WITH TRAGEDY FOLLOWING THE

1467
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
SEPTEMBER 11th ATTACKS.

1468
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE?

1469
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
HOW DO YOU HELP THEM?

1470
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
>> WELL, ANDERSON, THANK YOU FOR

1471
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
HAVING ME.

1472
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I THINK THE BIGGEST THING THAT

1473
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE

1474
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
CLOSEST YOU ARE TO THE

1475
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
EPICENTER, HEARING THE SHOTS,

1476
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
SEEING THE VIOLENCE VISUALLY,

1477
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
THE MORE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO

1478
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
BE ABLE TO DEBRIEF.

1479
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
AS I DEBRIEF SPECIAL FORCES

1480
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
PEOPLE AND SOLDIERS, IT'S VERY

1481
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
IMPORTANT THAT THESE CHILDREN,

1482
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
THEIR PARENTS UNDERSTAND THAT

1483
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
THERE'S LIFE AFTER TRAGEDY BUT

1484
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEIR

1485
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
STORIES, WE HAVE TO HELP THEM

1486
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
VENT AND RELEASE THAT

1487
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN

1488
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
NORMALIZE AND GO BACK TO SOME

1489
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
TYPE OF LIFE AS THEY KNEW IT

1490
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
BEFORE THIS TRAGIC DAY.

1491
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
>> WHAT KIND OF SYMPTOMS DO

1492
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
PARENTS, DO FRIENDS OF PEOPLE

1493
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR?

1494
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
>> WELL, TYPICALLY WITH

1495
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
CHILDREN, IT'S ALL AGE

1496
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
APPROPRIATENESS.

1497
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
SO IT REALLY DEPENDS.
BUT USUALLY SLEEP CAN BE

1498
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
DISRUPTED.

1499
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
THERE CAN BE NIGHTMARES.

1500
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
THERE COULD BE SUDDEN NOISES

1501
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
THAT COULD STARTLE THEM.

1502
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
MOODINESS THAT YOU'VE NOT SEEN

1503
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
BEFORE, MAYBE A LOSS IN APPETITE

1504
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
OR A LOSS OF INTEREST IN NORMAL

1505
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
THINGS.

1506
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
AND I THINK FOR PARENTS MAINLY,

1507
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
WE'RE ALL JUST MORTIFIED BY THIS

1508
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
EVENT.

1509
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
AND I THINK AS PARENTS WE HAVE

1510
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TALKING

1511
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
TO OUR CHILDREN, REGARDLESS OF

1512
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
WHERE WE ARE IN THE COUNTRY OR

1513
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
AROUND THE WORLD, THAT WE CAN

1514
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
LET OUR CHILDREN KNOW AND

1515
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
SUPPORT THEM TO SAY, LISTEN,

1516
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
IT'S OKAY, THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN

1517
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

1518
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
THIS WAS NOT A NORMAL SITUATION

1519
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
AND WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THEM AND

1520
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
CARE FOR THEM THAT THEY KNOW

1521
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
THAT THEY'RE SECURED IN A NORMAL

1522
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN.

1523
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
>> BUT TALKING ABOUT IT HELPS?

1524
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
>> WELL, AGAIN, IT DEPENDS ON

1525
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
THE AGE.

1526
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
THE AGES OF THE KIDS THAT YOU

1527
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
MENTIONED, I AGREE WITH YOU.

1528
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

1529
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
BE ABLE TO EVEN NAME THE NAMES

1530
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
AND THE AGES OF THESE CHILDREN.

1531
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
IT'S HEARTBREAKING.

1532
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
AND I THINK WHAT HE CAN DO, AS

1533
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
WE TALK TO OUR CHILDREN, IF

1534
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
CHILDREN CAN DRAW PICTURES AND

1535
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
WRITE LETTERS IF THAT'S WHAT IT

1536
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
GOES, TO FRIENDS THAT THEY LOST

1537
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
OR THE SITUATIONS THEY HEARD AND

1538
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
DESTROY THOSE LETTERS.

1539
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
WE DESTROY EVERYTHING THAT IS OF

1540
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
WASTE TO US.

1541
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
WE PUT GARBAGE BAGS OUT.

1542
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
WE FLUSH GARBAGE DISPOSALS.

1543
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH THE

1544
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
EMOTIONAL WASTE.

1545
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
WE HAVE TO HELP THEM VENT AND

1546
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
PROCESS, RELEASE IT AND LET THEM

1547
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
KNOW AS WE TALK TO THEM THAT

1548
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
THEY HAVE A REFUGE WITHIN US AND

1549
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
THAT WE AS PARENTS ARE THERE TO

1550
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
SUPPORT THEM THROUGH THIS
SITUATION.

1551
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
>> TERRY LYLES, I APPRECIATE

1552
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
YOUR EXPERTISE.

1553
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
NO DOUBT, WE'LL BE TALKING TO

1554
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
YOU IN THE DAYS AHEAD AS WELL.
