1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
IS SUGGESTING A BAN ON ALL GUNS

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
IN AMERICA.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
ABSOLUTELY PART OF AMERICAN

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
CULTURE AND PEOPLE BELIEVE IN

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
IT.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
HOWEVER, THERE ARE LIMITATIONS.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
THE AMENDMENT TALKS ABOUT A

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
WELL-REGULATED MILITIA.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
PEOPLE ARE CALLING OUT FOR

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
TAKING SOME OF THESE WEAPONS

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
AWAY FROM PEOPLE WITH POTENTIAL

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
MENTAL ISSUES.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
TO ME, THE QUESTION FOR YOU IS

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
THIS, THE LAST THREE MASS

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
SHOOTINGS IN THE LAST FOUR

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
MONTHS IN AMERICA, AURORA, OREGO

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
IN THE SHOPPING MALL AND NOW

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
HERE IN NEWTOWN HAVE INVOLVED

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
YOUNG PEOPLE USING THE SAME  AND

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
NOW HERE, NEWTOWN, ALL INVOLVED

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
YOUNG PEOPLE USING THE SAME

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
WEAPON.
AN AR-15 SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE ALL

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
WITH HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
IN AURORA, OVER 100 IN HIS

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
MAGAZINE WHICH HE COULD FIRE

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
OFF.
HERE WE SAW UP TO 30.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
HERE'S THE QUESTION.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
WHY DO YOU FEEL THAT AMERICANS

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
SHOULD HAVE THOSE IF YOUR BELIEF

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
IS THEY JUST HAVE TO DEFEND

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
THEMSELVES?

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
>> WELL, BEFORE I GO ANY

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
FURTHER, PIERS, FIRST, THANKS

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
FOR HAVING ME BACK.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
WE DID HAVE A HEATED DISCUSSION

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
LAST TIME AND I MUCH APPRECIATE
THIS MORE CALM DISCUSSION.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
SECOND, ON BEHALF OF I'M SURE I

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE BOARD OF
MICHIGAN COALITION OF

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS WE OFFER

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
OUR SINCERE CONDOLENCE AND

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
SYMPATHIES FOR THE VICTIMS AND

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
THEIR FAMILIES.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
WE ARE ALL ABOUT SAFETY.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
WE ALL WANT TO BE SAFE AND WE
CERTAINLY WANT CHILDREN TO BE

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
SAFE.
LIKE I SAID LAST WEEK, WE JUST

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
DISAGREE ON HOW TO GET THERE

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
FROM HERE.

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I WOULD

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
POINT OUT THAT THE SHOOTER IN

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
THE MALL IN OREGON WAS

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
CONFRONTED BY A LEGALLY ARMED

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
CITIZEN WHO POINTED HIS GUN AT

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
THE SHOOTER AND THEN DECIDED NOT

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
TO SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER BECAUSE

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
HE WAS AFRAID OF MISSING AND

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
HITTING BYSTANDERS.

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
HE WAS ACTING VERY RESPONSIBLY.

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
AND THE NEXT SHOT THAT THAT

60
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
SHOOTER FIRED, THAT THE KILLER

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
FIRED, WAS ON HIMSELF AFTER HE

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
WAS CONFRONTED WITH AN ARMED

63
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
CITIZEN.

64
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
SO THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE EXAMPLE

65
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
OF A RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNER USING

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
A GUN TO SAVE LIVES.

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
>> WELL, HE ACTUALLY DIDN'T USE

68
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
THE GUN.

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I THINK THE POINT, DAN, UNLESS

70
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'M MISTAKEN.

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
YOU TAKE IT UP HERE.

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
BUT I DON'T THINK ANY AMERICAN

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
CITIZEN WITH A LEGAL GUN HAS

74
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
EVER INTERVENED IN A MASS

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
SHOOTING, CERTAINLY NOT IN THE

76
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
LAST 30 OR 40 YEARS IN AMERICA.

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
SO IT SEEMS TO BE A BIT OF A

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
MYTH --

79
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
>> ACTUALLY, THEY HAVE.

80
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
>> LET DAN ANSWER.

81
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
>> BEFORE THIS EVOLVES INTO AN

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
ARGUMENT, I MEAN, AS EASY AS IT

83
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
IS TO BECOME UNINSPIRED BY A

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
CONVERSATION LIKE THIS AND WHAT

85
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
YOUR OTHER GUEST IS SAYING, I

86
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
JUST ENCOURAGE THE AMERICAN

87
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
PUBLIC TO NOT LOSE THE SENSE OF

88
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
INSPIRATION IN TERMS OF THE

89
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
CHANGE THAT WE HAVE THE

90
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
POTENTIAL TO ACCOMPLISH.

91
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
THIS IS NOT THE CONVERSATION

92
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WANT TO

93
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
HAVE.
THIS IS NOT OUR VISION WHERE THE

94
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
ANSWER TO VIOLENCE IS MORE

95
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
VIOLENCE, WHERE THE ANSWER TO

96
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
GUNS IS MORE GUNS.

97
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
THERE IS FERTILE GROUND WHERE

98
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

99
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
AMERICANS AGREE WITH THINGS LIKE

100
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS TO MAKE SURE

101
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
THAT 40% OF ALL GUN SALES THAT

102
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
ARE NOT CURRENTLY COVERED BY

103
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS TO PREVENT

104
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE FROM GETTING

105
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
GUNS, TO PREVENT CRIMINALS AND

106
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
DOMESTIC ABUSERS FROM GETTING

107
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
GUNS, TO CLOSE THAT GAPING HOLE
IN OUR SYSTEM.

108
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
GUN OWNERS, 74% OF NRA MEMBERS

109
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
SUPPORT SOLUTIONS LIKE THAT.

110
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES THIS

111
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
PLAYS OUT AS A POLARIZED

112
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
POLITICAL DEBATE IN SEGMENTS

113
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
LIKE THE ONE I WAS PART OF ALSO

114
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
ON FRIDAY NIGHT, BUT THE REALITY

115
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
IS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ISN'T

116
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
POLARIZED.

117
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THE ONLY PLACE THIS IS A

118
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
POLARIZED POLITICAL DEBATE IS IN

119
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
CONGRESS.

120
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO

121
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
TAKE THE VOICE OF THE

122
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO KNOW THAT,

123
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
AS PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID TONIGHT,

124
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
WE CAN BE BETTER THAN THIS AND

125
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
HOLD OUR LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE.

126
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
>> TO THE POLITICS SIDE, THIS IS

127
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
VERY INTERESTING TO ME.

128
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THIS IS ALMOST A MIRROR TRAGEDY

129
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN BRITAIN IN

130
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
1996 AND SCOTLAND, 16 YOUNG 5

131
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
AND 6-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN WERE

132
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
KILLED.
IT WAS THE WORST SHOOTING OF ITS

133
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
TYPE IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY,

134
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
AND AS A RESULT, A FULL HANDGUN

135
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
BAN WAS BROUGHT IN.

136
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
WHICH WOULD NOT BE APPLICABLE

137
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
HERE, BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY

138
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
IN CIRCULATION, HOWEVER, IT DID

139
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
HAPPEN.

140
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
BUT WHAT WAS MOST NOTABLE ABOUT
THE DEBATE, IT WAS COMPLETELY

141
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
NON-POLITICAL.

142
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
IT NEVER DESCENDED INTO LEFT AND

143
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
RIGHT.

144
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
MY QUESTION FOR YOU, STEVE, IS

145
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO BE

146
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
POLITICAL?

147
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
WHY CAN IT NOT JUST BE A

148
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
BIPARTISAN, ALL ENCOMPASSING,

149
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
AMERICAN DIALOGUE, WHICH LEADS

150
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
IN THE END TO PRAGMATIC

151
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
SOLUTION?

152
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
>> I AGREE WITH YOUR LAST

153
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
STATEMENT, ABSOLUTELY, PIERS.

154
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
IN FACT, OUR GROUP IS A SINGLE

155
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
ISSUE NON-PARTISAN GROUP.

156
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
WE HAVE INDEPENDENTS, DEMOCRATS,

157
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
AND REPUBLICANS ON OUR BOARD AND

158
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
IN OUR MEMBERSHIP, AND MOST ARE

159
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
ELECTED OFFICIALS.

160
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
WE ACTUALLY DO TAKE THAT

161
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
POSITION.

162
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
>> DO YOU AGREE WITH UNIVERSAL
BACKGROUND CHECKS?

163
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
>> UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS?

164
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
>> YES.

165
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
>> YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE CRIMINAL

166
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
BACKGROUND CHECK IN PLACE.

167
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
>> RIGHT, BUT THAT ONLY APPLIES

168
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
TO 60% OF GUN SALES.
DO YOU AGREE WITH COVERING THE

169
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
OTHER 40% OF GUN SALES WITH

170
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS?

171
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
>> WE AGREE THAT DISQUALIFIED

172
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
INDIVIDUALS SHOULD NOT HAVE
ACCESS TO FIREARMS.

173
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
>> SO YOU AGREE WITH THE

174
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT WOULD
BE --

175
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
>> ARE YOU GOING TO LET ME

176
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
FINISH?
PLEASE, PLEASE.

177
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
>> LET ME ASK YOU, GIVE ME ONE

178
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
GOOD REASON WHY THERE SHOULDN'T

179
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
BE 100% BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ALL

180
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
GUN TRANSACTIONS IN AMERICA.

181
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
GIVE ME A GOOD REASON.

182
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
>> IT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE,

183
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
PIERS, AS YOU POINTED OUT A

184
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
MOMENT AGO, TO DO 100%.

185
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
WE HAVE A LOT OF GUNS IN

186
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
CIRCULATION ON EARTH AND IN THE

187
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
UNITED STATES.

188
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
WE KNOW THAT GUNS PASS ACROSS

189
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
BORDERS.

190
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEW ONES.

191
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
>> NATIONAL AND STATE BORDERS.

192
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
>> LET ME FOCUS THE QUESTION

193
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
MORE SOLIDLY AND REALISTICALLY.

194
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
NEW GUNS PURCHASED FROM THIS DAY

195
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
FORWARD, WOULD YOU BE SUPPORTIVE

196
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
OF 100% REGISTRATION,

197
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
ACCOUNTABILITY, DATABASE, A

198
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
NATIONAL DATABASE, AND IF YOU'RE

199
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
NOT IN FAVOR OF THAT, WHY

200
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
WOULDN'T YOU BE?

201
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
>> OR AS CLOSE AS WE CAN GET TO

202
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
100%, WHICH IS A LOT CLOSER THAN

203
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
WHERE WE ARE NOW.

204
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
>> THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN PLACE

205
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
RIGHT NOW IS A LIST OF THOSE

206
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
DISQUALIFIED.
PERSONALLY, I WOULD SUPPORT THAT

207
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
BASED ON EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN

208
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
ABLE TO LEARN IN MY POSITION AS

209
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
PROFESSOR OF FIREARMS LAW AND IN

210
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
MY POSITION AS A TRAINER OF

211
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
CONCEALED PISTOL LICENSEES THAT

212
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
THE NATIONAL INSTANT CHECK

213
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE WORKING QUITE

214
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
WELL.

215
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I BELIEVE THAT'S ONE AREA

216
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
EVERYONE AGREES.

217
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
>> WE SHOULD APPLY TO 100% OF
GUN SALES?

218
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
>> WE HAVE A LIST OF FOLKS WHO

219
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
ARE DISQUALIFIED WHO HAVE BEEN

220
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
ADJUDICATED MENTALLY ILL, FELONY

221
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
RECORDS THAT DISQUALIFY THEM, ET

222
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
CETERA.

223
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THAT SYSTEM SEEMS TO WORK QUITE

224
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
WELL.

225
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
>> WE HAVE TO WRAP IT UP.

226
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU, STEVE,
IS THIS.

227
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THE LAST

228
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
THREE MASS SHOOTINGS, AS I SAID,

229
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
ALL FEATURED AN AR-15 RIFLE

230
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
AIDED AND ABETTED BY

231
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES, GIVE ME

232
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
A GOOD REASON WHY YOU ARE

233
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
COMFORTABLE WITH THOSE WEAPONS

234
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
STILL BEING SOLD IN CONNECTION

235
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
WITH HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES IN

236
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
AMERICA IN PLACES LIKE WALMART?

237
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
>> FAIR ENOUGH.

238
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
AND I DON'T KNOW ANY PARTICULAR

239
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
RETAILER, BUT I WILL SAY WE DID

240
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
TRY FROM 1994 TO 2004, WE TRIED

241
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
THE SO-CALLED ASSAULT WEAPONS

242
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
BAN.

243
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
IT HAD NO IMPACT ON CRIME THAT

244
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
ANYONE COULD MEASURE WHATSOEVER,

245
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
AND THE TRUTH IS SOMETIMES THESE

246
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
GUNS ARE USED IN VERY POSITIVE

247
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
WAYS TO SAVE LIVES.

248
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
THEY ARE FUNCTIONALLY IDENTICAL

249
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
TO SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS THAT

250
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
DATE BACK LITERALLY TO THE

251
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
1800s.

252
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
A HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINE IS

253
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
NOTHING BUT A STEEL BOX AND A

254
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
SPRING.

255
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
IT'S INCREDIBLY EASY TO MAKE A

256
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINE.

257
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANY SUCH BAN

258
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
WOULD BE INEFFECTIVE.

259
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
>> THIS IS TOTALLY DISCONNECTED

260
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
WITH WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

261
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
WANT AND THE CONVERSATION THAT'S

262
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
HAPPENING OUT THERE, AND THAT'S

263
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
WHAT GIVES ME INSPIRATION TO
CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS

264
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
LIKE THIS.

265
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC KNOWS WE ARE

266
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
BETTER THAN THIS.

267
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
WE DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A

268
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
SOCIETY WHERE VIOLENCE LEADS TO

269
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
MORE VIOLENCE AND GUNS LEAD TO

270
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
MORE GUNS.
THAT'S THE CONVERSATION

271
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
THAT'S STARTING.

272
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
THAT'S THE CONVERSATION THAT

273
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS LEADING AND

274
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO

275
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
SPEAK UP AROUND.

276
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
>> GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE.

277
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
>> WE ALL AGREE WE NEED SAFETY.

278
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
>> WE'RE ALL AGREED ON THAT.

279
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'M SURE THIS DEBATE WILL

280
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
CONTINUE.
WE WILL CONTINUE THIS DEBATE ON

281
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
THE SHOW.
IT'S BEEN AN IMPORTANT ONE FOR

282
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
AMERICA.

283
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
THANK YOU BOTH.
>>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID WE

284
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
CAN'T TOLERATE THIS ANYMORE, BUT

285
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
WILL THERE BE A CHANGE IN

286
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
GUN POLICY?

287
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'LL ASK FRANK BRUNI AFTER THE

288
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
BREAK.

289
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
>>> I WISH TO GOD SHE HAD HAD AN

290
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
M4 IN HER OFFICE LOCKED UP SO

291
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
WHEN SHE HEARD GUNFIRE SHE PULLS

292
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
IT OUT AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO

293
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
LUNGE HEROICALLY WITH NOTHING IN

294
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
HER HANDS, BUT SHE TAKES HIM

295
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
OFF, TAKES HIS HEAD OFF BEFORE

296
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
HE COULD KILL THOSE PRECIOUS

297
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
KIDS.

298
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
>> TEXAS CONGRESSMAN SAYING

299
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
SOMETHING MANY AMERICANS AGREE

300
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
WITH.
BUT IS ARMING TEACHERS A

301
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
SOLUTION?

302
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
FRANK BRUNI, WHEN I HEAR THAT, I

303
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
JUST DESPAIR, BUT IT IS A VIEW
MANY AMERICANS HAVE.

304
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
POLLS SUGGEST THAT IF THE

305
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
TEACHERS HAD ALL BEEN ARMED, ONE

306
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
WOULD HAVE SHOT THIS GUY AND

307
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
CHILDREN'S LIVES WOULD HAVE BEEN
SAVED.

308
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
>> IF POLICE OFFICERS CAN'T FIRE

309
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
WITH AN ACCURACY, THEY CAN'T

310
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
PREVENT THEMSELVES FROM INJURING

311
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THOSE PEOPLE.

312
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
WHY WOULD WE BELIEVE TEACHERS IN
SCHOOLS WOULD HAVE WONDERFUL

313
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
MARKSMANSHIP AND WOULD MAKE THIS

314
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
A BETTER THING.

315
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
IT DEFIES COMMON SENSE.

316
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
>> I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS.

317
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
IT CANNOT BE TRUE.

318
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
AMERICA HAS THE MOST GUNS OF ANY
OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD.

319
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
>> AND THE MOST GUN RELATED

320
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
DEATHS.
>> TWICE AS MANY AS ANYBODY

321
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
ELSE.

322
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.

323
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
>> THE PENNY DOESN'T SEEM TO

324
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
DROP WITH PEOPLE.

325
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
>> YOU HAD DAN GROSS ON BEFORE.

326
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I MET HIM BACK IN 1997 WHEN

327
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
ANOTHER EMPIRE STATE SHOOTING UP

328
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
AT THE TOP, HIS BROTHER WAS

329
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
HORRIBLY, HORRIBLY INJURED.

330
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'VE BEEN WRITING ON AND OFF
ABOUT GUN CONTROL.

331
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
SINCE THEN 15 YEARS, STATES HAVE

332
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
GOTTEN MORE LAX.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DONE

333
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
ANYTHING.
WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT WE'RE

334
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
MADE OF.

335
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A DEGREE OF

336
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
HEARTBREAK AND LEVEL OF OUTRAGE

337
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
THAT IS BIGGER THAN I'VE EVER

338
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
SEEN.

339
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHETHER

340
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
WE'RE WILLING TO DO ANYTHING.

341
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
>> I COMPLETELY AGREE.

342
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA IS

343
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
EMOTIONAL NOW, HE SAID THIS IS

344
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
THE FOURTH TIME TO COMFORT

345
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
COMMUNITIES TORN APART BY
SHOOTINGS.

346
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
SIX OF THE WORST MASS SHOOTINGS

347
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
IN AMERICAN HISTORY HAVE

348
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
HAPPENED SINCE 2007.

349
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
THIS IS BORDERING ON AN

350
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
EPIDEMIC.

351
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
>> IT'S NOT BORDERING ANYMORE.

352
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
IT IS AN EPIDEMIC.

353
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I THINK SOMETHING WILL CHANGE.

354
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
FOR THE FIRST TIME OUT OF THIS

355
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
MISERY I FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF

356
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
HOPE.

357
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I WATCHED YOUR SHOW FRIDAY, THE

358
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
AMOUNT OF OUTRAGE IN YOUR VOICE

359
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
WAS HIGHER THAN I HAD EVER SEEN.

360
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I THINK ABOUT THE OPENING OF

361
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" LAST NIGHT

362
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
WITH THAT RENDITION OF "SIDELINE

363
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
THE NIGHT."

364
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I WATCHED THE PRESIDENT ON

365
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
TELEVISION LAST NIGHT.

366
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
IT FEELS LIKE PEOPLE HAVE HAD

367
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
ENOUGH.

368
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID CAUSES ARE

369
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
COMPLEX AND WE DON'T KNOW BUT HE

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
AND YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHATEVER

738
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
MEASURE OF COMFORT WE CAN

739
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
PROVIDE, WE WILL PROVIDE.

740
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
>> WITH ME NOW ARE TWO CLERGY

741
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
MEMBERS WHO SPOKE AT THE VIGIL.

742
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
THE REVEREND MATT CREBBIN,

743
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
SENIOR MINISTER OF THE NEWTOWN
CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH.

744
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
AND RABBI PRAVER.

745
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO COME OUT OF
THIS?

746
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW?

747
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
>> I'M HOPING, ANDERSON, THIS
WILL BE THE TIPPING POINT IN OUR

748
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
COUNTRY.

749
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I FEEL THAT CHILDREN ARE

750
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
INUNDATED WITH THE CULTURE OF

751
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
VIOLENCE FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE.

752
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
FROM THE TOYS THAT WE PLAY WITH

753
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
TO THE MOVIES THAT WE SEE AND

754
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
THE TV THAT WE SEE.
THAT WE CAN DO BETTER, AND WE

755
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
CAN MAKE GAMES THAT ARE EXCITING

756
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
THAT HAVE A POSITIVE OBJECTIVE.

757
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
AND WE REALLY NEED TO DO THAT,

758
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S TOO

759
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
COMMONPLACE, THE VIOLENT
REACTION.

760
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
OF COURSE, THE INDIVIDUAL IS

761
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
DERANGED BUT THERE'S A PART OF

762
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
ME THAT THINKS IF WE HAD MORE OF

763
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
A CULTURE OF PEACE THAT THESE

764
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
KIND OF EVENTS WOULD BE LESS

765
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
LIKELY TO HAPPEN.

766
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
>> REVEREND, WHAT ARE YOU HOPING

767
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
COMES OUT OF THIS?

768
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
>> WELL, I'M HOPING FOR OUR

769
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
COMMUNITY THAT THE COMMUNITY

770
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
GROWS EVEN CLOSER AND STRONGER.

771
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT

772
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
HOW CLOSE AND STRONG IT WAS

773
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
BEFORE.

774
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
BUT AS YOU KNOW, IN A TRAGEDY
LIKE THIS, WE'RE VERY

775
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
VULNERABLE.

776
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
BUT I ALSO HAVE HOPE THAT WE CAN

777
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
BECOME STRONGER AND CLOSER AND
CARE FOR ONE ANOTHER IN DEEPER

778
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
WAYS.

779
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
>> IT'S EXTRAORDINARY JUST THE

780
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
LAST COUPLE DAYS, I'VE BEEN

781
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
HERE.

782
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
COMPLETE STRANGERS COME UP TO

783
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
ONE ANOTHER ON THE STREET AND

784
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
ARE HUGGING AND SHARING, SHARING

785
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
THEIR HEARTS WITH EACH OTHER.

786
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
>> RIGHT.

787
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
AND THERE'S AN OUTPOURING, BOTH

788
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
IN THE TOWN BUT AS YOU WELL

789
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
KNOW, FROM PEOPLE AROUND THE

790
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
WORLD.

791
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
AND -- BUT THAT WILL SLOWLY

792
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
DISSIPATE.

793
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
AND THE ATTENTION WILL DISAPPEAR

794
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
FROM THIS PLACE, AND WE'LL BE

795
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
RETURNING TO LIVES THAT ARE

796
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
SUPPOSED TO BE NORMAL.

797
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
FOR MANY PEOPLE, THEY WON'T FEEL

798
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
NORMAL AGAIN.

799
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
HOW DO WE MAKE THOSE LIVES FEEL

800
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
CONNECTED AND CLOSER AND CARED

801
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
FOR AND VIBRANT?

802
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS EVENT

803
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
TO DEFINE THE SPIRIT OF OUR

804
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
FAITH COMMUNITIES, THE SPIRIT OF

805
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
THIS COMMUNITY.

806
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
WE WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT

807
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
THERE IS SOMETHING MORE,

808
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
SOMETHING HOPEFUL, SOMETHING

809
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
THAT WE CAN EVEN BECOME MORE

810
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
COMPASSIONATE, MORE CARING, SOME

811
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
OF THE THINGS SHAUL HAS TALKED

812
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
ABOUT, HOW WE SEE PEOPLE NOT

813
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
JUST HERE IN FOUND BUT IN THE

814
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
WORLD.

815
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
>> I THOUGHT SEEING

816
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL FAITHS

817
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
W
ON THAT STAGE TONIGHT WAS A VERY

818
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
POWERFUL AND MOVING STATEMENT.

819
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
WHAT DO YOU -- HOW -- THERE'S SO

820
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
MANY PARENTS AROUND THE WORLD

821
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
WHO ARE FOLLOWING THIS, WHO

822
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THEIR

823
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
CHILDREN, DON'T KNOW HOW TO

824
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
EXPLAIN IT.

825
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
HOW DO YOU COUNCIL SOMEBODY.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM?

826
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
>> YOU MEAN, AROUND THE COUNTRY?

827
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
>> YEAH, OR HERE, ANYWHERE.
>> WE HAVE YOUNG ONES TOO, WE

828
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
HAVE FIRST GRADERS, WE WANT THEM

829
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
TO KNOW THAT SOMETHING BAD

830
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
HAPPENED.
WE HAVE TO TELL THEM SOMETHING.

831
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
WE HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING YET.

832
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
YES, SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED BUT

833
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
IT'S VERY USUAL AND THE BAD MAN

834
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
CAN'T HURT ANYONE ANYMORE.

835
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
THAT'S HOW WE WOULD, AS FIRST

836
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
GRADERS WE WOULD APPROACH THAT.

837
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
AND WE JUST NEED TO WORK TO MAKE

838
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
OUR COMMUNITY BETTER, AND NOT TO

839
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
BE AFRAID, YOU'RE SAFE WITH

840
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
MOMMY AND DADDY.

841
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
YOU'RE SAFE.

842
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
>> NO DOUBT YOU'VE HAD TO
COUNCIL PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST

843
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
LOVED ONES, WHAT DO YOU SAY IN

844
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
THAT -- IS THERE ANYTHING TO

845
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
SAY OR IS IT JUST LISTEN?

846
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
>> THERE ARE THINGS TO SAY, BUT

847
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I THINK OFTEN TIMES WE'RE

848
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
INCLINED TO WANT TO SAY THINGS

849
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
FIRST.

850
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I THINK LISTENING IS THE FIRST

851
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
RESPONSE, IS TO LISTEN TO

852
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
PEOPLE'S GRIEF, LISTEN TO WHAT

853
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
THEY'RE -- EVEN IF THEY CAN'T

854
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
ARTICULATE NOT COMING IN

855
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
THINKING THAT A CERTAIN WORD,

856
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
PHRASE OR EVEN PEOPLE OF FAITH,

857
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
CERTAIN SCRIPTURES WILL JUST

858
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
SOLVE OR HEAL INSTANTLY.

859
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
BUT THOSE WORDS OF SCRIPTURE,

860
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
THOSE WORDS ARE SIGNIFICANT.

861
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
BUT REALIZING THAT WE HAVE TO

862
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
CONTINUE TO LISTEN AND TO FIND

863
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
APPROPRIATE WAYS WITH THEM TO

864
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
FIND EXPRESSION AND A MEANING

865
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
THAT COME OUT OF OUR TRADITIONS.

866
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
FOLKS I COUNCIL IN MY OWN
TRADITION.

867
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
THAT WOULD BE WHAT WE WOULD DRAW

868
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
UPON IN OUR CHRISTIAN FAITH.

869
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
>> THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS

870
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
SOMETHING -- THAT PAIN NEVER
GOES AWAY.

871
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
>> IT'S REALLY HORRIBLE.

872
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
AND WHEN YOU SEE THE PARENTS
WAILING LIKE THAT, YOU REALIZE,

873
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
THAT'S HOW WE WOULD BE IF WE

874
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
WERE THERE TOO.

875
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
THESE ARE ALL OF OUR CHILDREN.

876
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
AND SO -- I THINK MATT SAID IT

877
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
VERY WELL, YOU TAKE YOUR CUES,

878
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
SEE WHERE THE PERSON'S AT.

879
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
THERE'S ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF

880
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
PEOPLE.
SOME PEOPLE WILL LIKE A

881
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
THEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION.

882
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
NOAH'S MOTHER, VERONICA, I TOLD

883
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
HER THIS MORNING, WHERE IS THE

884
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
6-YEAR-OLD INSIDE OF YOU, WHERE

885
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
DID IT GO?

886
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
SHE SAID, WELL, IT'S STILL IN

887
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
ME.
IN A SENSE, THERE'S A SPIRITUAL

888
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
IDEA THAT THERE REALLY IS NO

889
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
DEATH AND IT'S JUST

890
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
TRANSFORMATION AS WE, THROUGH

891
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
NATURE, GROW.

892
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
OUR 6-YEAR-OLD IS STILL

893
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
SURROUNDED BY THE GREATER ASPECT

894
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
OF OURSELVES AS WE GROW AND

895
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
MATURE.

896
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
AND SO IT'S A LEAP OF FAITH TO

897
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
SAY AFTER WE LEAVE OUR BODY THAT

898
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
WE BECOME PART OF A GREATER
MATRIX OR A GREATER MOTIF IN THE

899
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
UNIVERSE.

900
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
>> I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU FOR

901
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
BEING WITH US TONIGHT, BUT ALSO

902
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
JUST BEING ON THE STAGE AND WHAT

903
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
YOU SAID, I THOUGHT IT WAS

904
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
EXTRAORDINARILY POWERFUL.

905
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
THANK YOU.

906
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
>> THANK YOU.

907
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
>> THANK YOU.

908
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
>> WISH YOU THE BEST.

909
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
THANK YOU.

910
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
THANK YOU.

911
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
>>> WHEN WE COME BACK,

912
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
REMEMBERING PRINCIPAL DAWN

913
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
HOCHSPRUNG.

914
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
WITH HER CHILDREN AND HER

915
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
HUSBAND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

[ Female Announcer ] BORN
FROM THE SWEET MONK FRUIT,

917
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000

920
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
MADE FROM THE GOODNESS
OF FRUIT.

921
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
NEW NECTRESSE.

922
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
SWEETNESS NATURALLY.

923
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
>>> THE PRINCIPAL WHO -- GOD

924
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
BLESS HER -- LOST HER LIFE.

925
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
SHE WAS A VERY SPECIAL PERSON.

926
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
AND ALL THE PARENTS KNEW THAT.

927
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
>> THE PRINCIPAL OF SANDY HOOK

928
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
ELEMENTARY WAS RESPECTED AND

929
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
ADMIRED BY THE TEACHERS AND

930
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
PARENTS AND LOVED BY THE

931
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
STUDENTS AS WELL.

932
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
DAWN HOCHSPRUNG WAS HER NAME,

933
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
WE MENTIONED HER BEFORE,

934
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
SHE BECAME PRINCIPAL TWO YEARS

935
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
AGO, SHE WAS A MOM OF ONE OF THE

936
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
FIRST GRADERS, SHE NEVER SAW HER

937
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
WITHOUT A SMILE, ON THAT AWFUL

938
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
DAY AT THAT SCHOOL WHO SURVIVED,

939
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
SAY DAWN DIED PROTECTING THEM,

940
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
CONFRONTING THE GUNMAN HERSELF.

941
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
IT WAS A TERRIBLE LOSS OF A

942
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
BELOVED PRINCIPAL, MORE

943
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
IMPORTANTLY, OF A WIFE, MOTHER

944
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
AND GRANDMOTHER.

945
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000

PRESIDENT OBAMA HOLDING HER

950
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
GRANDDAUGHTER BUT NOT AS PROUD

951
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
AS I AM OF HER.

952
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
GARY TUCHMAN SPOKE WITH DAWN

953
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
HOCHSPRUNG'S HUSBAND AND KIDS

954
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
ABOUT THE REMARKABLE WOMAN SHE

955
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
WAS.

956
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
>> Reporter: PRINCIPAL DAWN

957
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
HOCHSPRUNG WAS QUITE A BIT

958
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
YOUNGER THAN HER HUSBAND GEORGE,

959
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED TEN YEARS
AGO, GEORGE WAS MARRYING HIS

960
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
BOSS.

961
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
>> SHE WAS AN ASSISTANT

962
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
PRINCIPAL AT OUR SCHOOL, AND I

963
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
WAS A 7th GRADE MATH TEACHER AT

964
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
THAT TIME.

965
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
AND I JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH

966
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
HER.

967
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
>> GEORGE MADE THE BIG DECISION,

968
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
THE TIME HAD COME TO PROPOSE.

969
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
>> SHE TURNED ME DOWN FIVE

970
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
TIMES.

971
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
>> YOU ASKED HER TO MARRY YOU,
BUT SHE TURNED YOU DOWN?

972
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
>> FIVE TIMES.

973
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE SIXTH TIME?

974
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
>> THE SIXTH TIME I WAITED UNTIL

975
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
IT WASN'T SUCH ROUGH SAILING.

976
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
>> Reporter: GEORGE HAD BEEN

977
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
POPPING THE QUESTION ON A

978
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
SAILBOAT THEY BOUGHT TOGETHER.

979
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
>> WE GOT MARRIED ON THE SWOOP

980
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
OUT OF MYSTIC.

981
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
BETH, AMY AND ANN ARE GEORGE'S
DAUGHTERS FROM HIS FIRST

982
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
MARRIAGE.
ERICA IS DAWN'S DAUGHTER FROM

983
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
HER FIRST MARRIAGE.

984
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
HER OTHER DAUGHTER TINA WAS OUT

985
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
WHILE WE WERE AT THE HOUSE.

986
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
THEY'RE A BLENDED BUT VERY CLOSE

987
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
FAMILY WITH 11 GRANDCHILDREN.

988
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
>> WE BUILT THIS BEAUTIFUL HOUSE
IN THE ADIRONDACKS, THE DREAM

989
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
WAS, CHRONOLOGICAL DREAM, IT WAS

990
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
GOING TO BE DAWN'S HOUSE,

991
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO DIE.

992
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I'M MUCH OLDER THAN DAWN.

993
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
IT WAS GOING TO BE DAWN'S HOUSE,

994
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
DAWN'S GRANDCHILDREN, ALL THESE

995
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
CHILDREN COULD USE THE HOUSE ON

996
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
THE LAKE AND IT WOULD BE

997
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
WONDERFUL.

998
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
WE BUILT ROOMS DOWNSTAIRS FOR

999
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
KIDS AND IT WAS GOING TO BE

1000
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
DAWN'S HOUSE ULTIMATELY.

1001
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
WITH ALL THE CHILDREN.
ALL THE CHILDREN.

1002
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
AND NOW IT'S ME.

1003
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I CAN'T -- I DON'T THINK I CAN

1004
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
DO THAT.

1005
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
>> I WANT TO REITERATE TO YOU,

1006
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
GEORGE, YOU HAVE THESE BEAUTIFUL

1007
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
DAUGHTERS AND SON IN LAWS AND

1008
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
GRANDCHILDREN AND EVERYONE WILL

1009
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
BE HERE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

1010
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
IS THAT RIGHT, LADIES?

1011
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
>> OF COURSE.

1012
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
>> MY JOB HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO

1013
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
TAKE CARE OF OTHER PEOPLE.

1014
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT IF SOME PEOPLE

1015
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
TAKE CARE OF YOU FOR A WHILE?
>> NO ONE TAKES CARE OF ME.

1016
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
>> STOP BEING SO STUBBORN.

1017
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
>> Reporter: GEORGE STILL TAUGHT

1018
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL WHERE THEY

1019
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
MET.

1020
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY FRIDAY,

1021
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
THIS IS HOW GEORGE FOUND OUT

1022
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
WHAT HAPPENED.

1023
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
>> ONE OF THE KIDS CAME UP WITH

1024
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
A COMPUTER AND SAID, SOMETHING'S

1025
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
HAPPENING AT SANDY HOOK SCHOOL

1026
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
AND YOUR WIFE'S BEEN KILLED.

1027
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
>> GEORGE RACED OUT OF SCHOOL

1028
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
AND INTO A NIGHTMARE, LIKE ALL

1029
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
THE FAMILIES OF VICTIMS THEY

1030
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
WANT TO KNOW MORE.

1031
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
AND ON THIS DAY THEY HAVE
LEARNED MORE.

1032
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
TWO TEACHERS WHO SURVIVED SAID

1033
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
THEY WERE HAVING A MEETING WITH

1034
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
DAWN WHEN THE SHOTS STARTED

1035
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
RINGING OUT.

1036
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
>> SHE PUT HERSELF IN JEOPARDY,

1037
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
AND I HAVE BEEN ANGRY ABOUT THAT

1038
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
UNTIL JUST NOW, TODAY, WHEN I

1039
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
MET THE TWO WOMEN SHE TOLD TO GO

1040
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
UNDER SHELTER WHILE SHE ACTUALLY

1041
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
CONFRONTED THE GUNMAN.

1042
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
SHE COULD HAVE AVOIDED THAT.

1043
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
AND SHE DIDN'T.
I KNEW SHE WOULDN'T.

1044
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I'M NOT ANGRY ANYMORE.

1045
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I'M NOT ANGRY.
I'M NOT ANGRY ANYMORE.

1046
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I'M NOT ANGRY.

1047
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I'M JUST VERY SAD.

1048
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
THEY SAID, WE'RE AT THE MEETING,

1049
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
THERE WERE GUNSHOTS, SOMEBODY

1050
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
SHOT THE WINDOW, SOMEBODY CAME

1051
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
IN, INTO THE -- NOT INTO THE

1052
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
OFFICE BUT INTO THE BUILDING,

1053
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
THE FOYER OF THE BUILDING AND

1054
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
DAWN TOLD US TO GO HIDE AND SHE

1055
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
AND AT LEAST ONE OTHER TEACHER

1056
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
RAN OUT AND ACTUALLY TRIED TO

1057
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
SUBDUE THE KILLER.

1058
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT COMES

1059
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
FROM, DAWN WAS ALL OF 5'2".

1060
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
>> EVERYONE HERE IS PROUD, NO

1061
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
ONE MORE SO THAN ERICA, WHO SAID

1062
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
HER MOM WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR HER

1063
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
DAUGHTERS.

1064
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
>> EVERY GAME SHE WAS THERE,

1065
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
EVERY PRACTICING WITH ALL OF MY

1066
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
SISTER'S CHEERLEADING STUFF SHE

1067
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
WAS THERE, EVERY DANCE

1068
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
COMPETITION.
SHE WAS DOING HOME WORK ON THE

1069
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
BLEACHERS.

1070
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
SHE WAS THERE.

1071
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
AND SHE WAS MY ROCK.

1072
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
MY ROCK.

1073
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
>> AND NOW SHE IS A HERO TOO.

1074
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
>> FINAL THING I WANT TO ASK

1075
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
YOU, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO YOUR

1076
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
MOM RIGHT NOW?
>> COME BACK.

1077
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
JUST COME BACK.

1078
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
>> GARY TUCHMAN JOINS ME NOW

1079
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
LIVE.

1080
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I GUESS SOME PEOPLE DON'T

1081
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WOULD TALK
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

1082
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
WHAT I FOUND IS OFTEN TIMES
PEOPLE WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT

1083
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
THEIR LOVED ONE.

1084
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT THE LIFE

1085
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
THEY LIVED, NOT JUST HOW THEIR

1086
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
LIFE ENDED.

1087
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT, ANDERSON.

1088
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
AND THEY ARE SUCH A WONDERFUL

1089
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
AND AMAZING FAMILY.

1090
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
WE'RE SO GRATEFUL THEY LET US
INTO THEIR HOME ON A DAY LIKE

1091
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
THIS.

1092
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO

1093
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
STAY CLOSE AND STAY UNITED.

1094
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
THAT'S WHAT WILL GIVE THEM

1095
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
STRENGTH.

1096
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
OF THE FIVE DAUGHTERS, TWO OF

1097
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000

1112
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
JANET VULMER, A KINDERGARTEN

1113
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
TEACHER AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

1114
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
JOINS ME LIVE.

1115
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I SPOKE TO YOU ON THE PHONE

1116
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
FRIDAY.
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU ALL

1117
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
WEEKEND.

1118
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I THINK HEROES ARE TEACHERS

1119
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
EVERY DAY AROUND THE COUNTRY.

1120
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I FIND -- I JUST THINK WHAT YOU

1121
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
DID WAS SO HEROIC.

1122
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
YOU -- EXPLAIN AGAIN, YOU

1123
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
HEARD -- YOU KNEW SOMETHING WAS

1124
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
GOING WRONG.
HOW?

1125
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
>> WELL, I MEAN WE WERE IN OUR

1126
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
CLASSROOM, WE HEARD WHAT SOUNDED
LIKE GUNSHOTS, NOISES.

1127
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
>> YOU HEARD THAT --
>> WELL, THERE WAS A LOUD

1128
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
SPEAKER, THE P.A. SYSTEM WAS NOT

1129
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
WORKING IN THE WAY IT NORMALLY

1130
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
IS, YOU DON'T USUALLY HEAR
THINGS UNLESS SOMEONE MAKES AN

1131
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
ANNOUNCEMENT.

1132
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
THERE WERE NOISES THAT DIDN'T

1133
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
SOUND CORRECT.

1134
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
THERE WAS NO ONE TELLING US IT

1135
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
WAS A DRILL.

1136
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
WE JUST THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS

1137
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
NOT RIGHT.

1138
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
WE TOOK THE CHILDREN AND WENT

1139
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
INTO A LOCKDOWN, WE GO TO A
CERTAIN PLACE IN THE ROOM.

1140
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
WE PULL THE BLINDS DOWN, WE LOCK

1141
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
THE CLASSROOM DOORS AND WE COVER

1142
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
THE WINDOW AT THE DOOR.

1143
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
>> THIS IS SOMETHING YOU HAD

1144
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
PRACTICED.

1145
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
>> ABOUT A MONTH OR SO BEFORE,

1146
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
DAWN MAKES SURE WE DO THAT.

1147
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
AND WE GO TO A SAFE PLACE AND

1148
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
TYPICALLY WHEN IT'S A DRILL THEY

1149
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
TELL US, OKAY, AND WE EVEN

1150
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
EXITED THE BUILDING FOLLOWING A
CERTAIN PATH.

1151
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
IF THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY WE

1152
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
WOULD GO DOWN TO THE SANDY HOOK

1153
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
FIREHOUSE AND GATHER THERE,
WHICH IS WHAT WE DID THAT DAY.

1154
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
WE KNEW THAT --

1155
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
>> BUT YOU SAT THE KIDS DOWN.

1156
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
>> WE SAT IN THE CUBBY AREA,

1157
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
AWAY FROM THE DOOR SO NO ONE

1158
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
COULD SEE US, READ THEM A STORY,

1159
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
TALKED TO THEM.

1160
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
THEY KEPT SAYING HOW COME WE'RE

1161
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
HERE FOR SO LONG.

1162
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
WELL, IT WILL BE A LITTLE
LONGER.

1163
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
WHEN THEY'RE 5 YOU TELL THEM

1164
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
WHATEVER YOU DO TO KEEP THEM

1165
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
SAFE AND KEEP THEM CALM.

1166
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
>> THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN

1167
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
THINKING ABOUT ALL WEEKEND,

1168
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
THOUGH, THE COURAGE FOR YOU TO

1169
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
BE ABLE TO SIT THERE AND READ A

1170
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
STORY AND KEEP THEM CALM --

1171
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
>> I THINK THE ADRENALINE KICKS

1172
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
IN AND YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO

1173
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
DO.
THERE WERE TWO OTHER PEOPLE IN

1174
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
THE ROOM HELPING ME WITH PULLING

1175
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
DOWN THE BLINDS AND THAT.

1176
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I WAS FOCUSED ON THE KIDS AND

1177
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
JUST KEEPING THEM SAFE.

1178
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I'M NOT ABOUT TO TELL THEM THAT

1179
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I THINK SOMETHING IS VERY BAD OR

1180
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
VERY WRONG.

1181
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
SO WE WAITED AND WAITED AND IT

1182
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
SEEMED LIKE A VERY LONG TIME.

1183
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
MAYBE IT WAS 20 MINUTES, A HALF

1184
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
HOUR, I'M NOT SURE.

1185
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
THERE WERE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR.

1186
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
IT WAS POLICE, SOMEONE, TELLING

1187
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
US WE HAD TO LEAVE.

1188
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
DIDN'T WANT TO OPEN THE DOOR AT

1189
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
FIRST BUT WE DID.

1190
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
YOU KNOW, THEY SAID HAVE THE

1191
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
CHILDREN WALK, HOLD HANDS, COVER

1192
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
THEIR EYES IF THEY COULD

1193
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T SAY

1194
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
WHY.

1195
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
HAVE THEM COVER THEIR EYES.

1196
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
AT 5, COVERING THEIR EYES AND

1197
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
WALKING ISN'T SO EASY.

1198
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I HAD THEM LOOK TOWARDS THE WALL

1199
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
AND WE WENT DOWN THE HALL AND

1200
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
OUT OF THE BUILDING.

1201
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I SAID BOYS AND GIRLS, REMEMBER

1202
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
THE ADVENTURE WE HAD, WE ALL

1203
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
WALKED TO THE FIREHOUSE?

1204
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
WE'RE ALL GOING TO DO THAT

1205
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
AGAIN.
BY THEN THE DRIVEWAY OF THE

1206
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
SCHOOL WAS FILLED WITH A LOT OF

1207
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
POLICE AND SIRENS AND THAT BUT

1208
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
YOU KNOW --

1209
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
>> HOW ARE YOU HOLING UP?

1210
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
>> AGAIN, ADRENALINE, YOU'RE

1211
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
MOVING, YOU'RE MOVE, YOU KNOW

1212
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
YOU HAVE TO GET TO SAFETY.

1213
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION

1214
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
WAS REALLY OCCURRING.

1215
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION.

1216
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
>> BUT HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP

1217
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
NOW?
>> HOW AM I HOLDING UP NOW.

1218
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
>> YOU KNEW A LOT OF THESE KIDS.

1219
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
>> TEN OF THE CHILDREN WERE IN

1220
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
MY CLASS LAST YEAR.

1221
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
TEN OF THE KIDS WHO ARE DEAD

1222
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
NOW.

1223
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
WHEN I HEARD THOSE NAMES, IT'S

1224
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
TOUGH.

1225
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
IT'S TOUGH.
YOU KNOW?

1226
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I'M WANTING TO ATTEND SOME OF

1227
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
THE SERVICES, I'M SURE SOME

1228
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
FAMILIES WANT PRIVACY.

1229
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
THERE'S A FEW CHILDREN WHO I'VE

1230
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
HAD NOT JUST THEM, I'VE HAD

1231
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
THEIR SIBLINGS AND IN ONE CASE

1232
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I'VE HAD ALL THREE.

1233
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
THEIR FAMILIES WE'RE CLOSE WITH.

1234
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
AT SANDY HOOK SCHOOL WE'RE A

1235
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
TIGHT-KNIT GROUP.

1236
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY ALSO.

1237
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
>> DAWN AND ALL THE OTHERS,

1238
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
OBVIOUSLY YOU WORKED WITH THEM.

1239
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
>> YES.
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO

1240
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
KNOW ABOUT THEM, ABOUT THIS

1241
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
COMMUNITY, ABOUT --

1242
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
>> I WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO

1243
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
COME BACK TO SCHOOL.

1244
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL COME BACK

1245
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
TO SANDY HOOK SCHOOL.

1246
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I'M HEARING WE'LL POSSIBLY BE

1247
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
MOVED TO ANOTHER BUILDING

1248
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

1249
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
WE DO NEED TO GET THE KIDS BACK

1250
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
IN SCHOOL.

1251
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
WE NEED TO SEE THEM.

1252
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
IT WAS HELPFUL TONIGHT TO SEE

1253
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
SOME FAMILIES.

1254
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
THEY WERE ALL CALLING US HEROES.

1255
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
WE DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT.

1256
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
WE DID WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO AND

1257
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
KEPT THEIR CHILDREN SAFE AND,

1258
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
YOU KNOW, I WAS ABLE TO TELL

1259
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
EVERYBODY IN MY CLASS YOUR KIDS

1260
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
ARE SAFE.
THAT MADE ME FEEL GOOD.

1261
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
>> YOU'RE A HERO TO ME AND I

1262
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
THINK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.

1263
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> I APPRECIATE YOU TALKING.

1264
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
>> ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

1265
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
>> AMAZING.

1266
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
COMING UP, WE WANT TO PLAY YOU

1267
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
MORE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH

1268
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
AT THE MEMORIAL SERVICE TONIGHT.

1269
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
AT ONE POINT PRESIDENT ASKING IF

1270
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
WE CAN HONESTLY SAY WE ARE DOING

1271
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN SAFE

1272
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
FROM HARM.

1273
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
>> CAN WE SAY WE'RE TRULY DOING

1274
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
ENOUGH TO GIVE ALL THE CHILDREN

1275
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
OF THIS COUNTRY THE CHANCE THEY

1276
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
DESERVE TO LIVE OUT THEIR LIVES

1277
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
AND HAPPINESS AND WITH PURPOSE?

1278
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I'VE BEEN REFLECTING ON THIS THE

1279
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
LAST FEW DAYS.

1280
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
IF WE'RE HONEST WITH OURSELVES,

1281
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
THE ANSWER IS NO.

1282
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH.

1283
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
>>> WE WANT TO SHARE A VIDEO

1284
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
WITH YOU.

1285
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
IT'S THE KIND OF VIDEO, FRANKLY,

1286
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
ALL PARENTS TAKE OF THEIR

1287
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
CHILDREN, A VIDEO CHRONICLING

1288
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
THE SMALL MOMENTS, THE SWEET

1289
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
MOMENTS, THE MOMENTS THAT MAKE

1290
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
UP A CHILDHOOD.

1291
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
IT'S A VIDEO OF ONE OF THE

1292
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
CHILDREN WHO DIED IN THIS

1293
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY, A BEAUTIFUL

1294
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
LITTLE GIRL, 6 YEARS OLD, HER

1295
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
NAME ANA MARQUEZ-GREENE.

1296
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
HER BROTHER, ISAIAH WAS ALSO AT

1297
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
THE SCHOOL.

1298
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
HE WAS NOT HARMED.

1299
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
ANA'S FATHER GAVE US PERMISSION

1300
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
TO SHOW THIS VIDEO.

1301
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T SHOW IT.

1302
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
THEY WANT YOU TO SEE HER AS SHE

1303
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
WAS, SINGING, MAKING MUSIC WITH

1304
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
HER BROTHER AND PRAISING GOD.

1305
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
TONIGHT WE REMEMBER ANA, WE

1306
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
REMEMBER ALL THE CHILDREN.

1307
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
>> COME NOW ALL MIGHTY KING.

1308
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
>> ONE, TWO, THREE, READY AND

1309
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000

1310
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
♪ COME NOW ALMIGHTY KING

1311
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
♪ HELP US TO SEE

00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
♪

1314
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
>> AMEN.

1315
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLY

1316
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
EMOTIONAL NIGHT HERE IN NEWTOWN,

1317
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
CONNECTICUT, AS IT HAS BEEN THE

1318
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
LAST SEVERAL NIGHTS AS THE

1319
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
COMMUNE CAME TOGETHER FOR THAT

1320
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
MEMORIAL SERVICE AT THE HIGH

1321
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
SCHOOL JUST BEHIND ME.

1322
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA MET WITH

1323
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
VICTIM'S FAMILIES AND SPOKE AT
THE SERVICE.

1324
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
WE WANT TO PLAY YOU MORE OF WHAT

1325
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
HE SAID TONIGHT WITH SINCERE

1326
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
HOPE THAT THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS

1327
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
BROUGHT SOME MEASURE OF COMFORT,

1328
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
SOME SMALL MEASURE OF COMFORT IN

1329
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
SOME WAY TO THE PEOPLE OF

1330
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
NEWTOWN TONIGHT.

1331
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
>> THIS IS OUR FIRST TASK,

1332
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
CARING FOR OUR CHILDREN.

1333
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
IT'S OUR FIRST JOB.

1334
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
IF WE DON'T GET THAT RIGHT, WE

1335
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
DON'T GET ANYTHING RIGHT.

1336
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
THAT'S HOW, AS A SOCIETY, WE

1337
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
WILL BE JUDGED.

1338
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
AND BY THAT MEASURE, CAN WE

1339
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
TRULY SAY AS A NATION THAT WE'RE

1340
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
MEETING OUR OBLIGATIONS?

1341
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
CAN WE HONESTLY SAY THAT WE'RE

1342
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
DOING ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR

1343
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
CHILDREN, ALL OF THEM, SAFE FROM

1344
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
HARM?

1345
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
>> I'VE BEEN REFLECTING ON THIS

1346
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
THE LAST FEW DAYS, IF WE'RE
HONEST WITH OURSELVES, THE

1347
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
ANSWER IS NO.

1348
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH.

1349
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
AND WE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE.

1350
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
SINCE I'VE BEEN PRESIDENT, THIS

1351
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
IS THE FOURTH TIME WE HAVE COME

1352
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
TOGETHER TO COMFORT A GRIEVING

1353
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
COMMUNITY TORN APART BY MASS

1354
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
SHOOTINGS.

1355
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
FOURTH TIME WE'VE HUGGED

1356
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
SURVIVORS.

1357
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
FOURTH TIME WE'VE CONSOLED THE

1358
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
FAMILIES OF VICTIMS.

1359
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
AND IN BETWEEN THERE HAVE BEEN

1360
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
AN ENDLESS SHOOTINGS ACROSS THE

1361
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
COUNTRY, ALMOST DAILY REPORTS OF

1362
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
VICTIM, MANY OF THEM CHILDREN,

1363
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
IN SMALL TOWNS AND BIG CITIES

1364
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
ALL ACROSS AMERICA.

1365
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
VICTIMS WHOSE MUCH OF THE TIME

1366
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
THEY'RE ONLY FAULT WAS BEING IN

1367
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG

1368
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
TIME.

1369
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
WE CAN'T TOLERATE THIS ANYMORE.

1370
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
THESE TRAGEDIES MUST END.

1371
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
AND TO END THEM WE MUST CHANGE.

1372
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
WE WILL BE TOLD THAT THE CAUSES

1373
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
OF SUCH VIOLENCE ARE COMPLEX AND

1374
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
THAT IS TRUE.

1375
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
NO SINGLE LAW, NO SET OF LAWS

1376
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
CAN ELIMINATE EVIL FROM THE

1377
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
WORLD OR PREVENT EVERY SENSELESS

1378
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
ACT OF VIOLENCE IN OUR SOCIETY.

1379
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
BUT THAT CAN'T BE AN EXCUSE FOR

1380
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
INACTION.

1381
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
SURELY WE CAN DO BETTER THAN

1382
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
THIS.

1383
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
IF THERE'S EVEN ONE STEP WE CAN

1384
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
TAKE TO SAVE ANOTHER CHILD OR

1385
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
ANOTHER PARENT OR ANOTHER TOWN

1386
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
FROM THE GRIEF THAT'S VISITED

1387
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
TUCSON AND AURORA AND OAK CREEK

1388
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
AND NEWTOWN AND COMMUNITIES

1389
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
FROM COLUMBINE TO BLACKSBURG

1390
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
BEFORE THAT, THEN SURELY WE HAVE

1391
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
AN OBLIGATION TO TRY.

1392
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
IN THE COMING WEEKS I'LL USE

1393
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE HOLDS

1394
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
TO ENGAGE MY FELLOW CITIZENS

1395
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO MENTAL

1396
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO PARENTS

1397
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
AND EDUCATORS IN AN EFFORT AIMED

1398
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
AT PREVENTING MORE TRAGEDIES

1399
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
LIKE THIS.

1400
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
BECAUSE WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE.

1401
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
WE CAN'T ACCEPT EVENTS LIKE THIS

1402
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
AS ROUTINE.

1403
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
ARE WE REALLY PREPARED TO SAY

1404
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
THAT WE'RE POWERLESS IN THE FACE

1405
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
OF SUCH CARNAGE?

1406
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
THAT THE POLITICS ARE TOO HARD?

1407
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
ARE WE PREPARED TO SAY THAT SUCH

1408
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
VIOLENCE VISITED ON OUR CHILDREN

1409
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR IS

1410
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
SOMEHOW THE PRICE OF OUR

1411
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
FREEDOM?

1412
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA EARLIER

1413
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
TONIGHT SPEAKING AT THE HIGH

1414
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
SCHOOL JUST BEHIND US WOLF

1415
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
BLITZER JOIN ME NOW LIVE.

1416
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I WAS WONDERING ABOUT YOUR

1417
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
THOUGHTS WHILE LISTENING TO THE

1418
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
PRESIDENT.

1419
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
>> YOU KNOW, HE DID TONIGHT WHAT

1420
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
HE DIDN'T DO THE EARLIER TIMES.

1421
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
HE TRIED TO COMFORT THE NATION.

1422
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
HE SPECIFICALLY PROMISED THAT HE

1423
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
WOULD TAKE STEPS, HE DIDN'T GO

1424
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
INTO DETAILS, TAKE STEPS TO TRY

1425
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE

1426
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
SENSELESS KILLINGS DON'T HAPPEN

1427
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
AGAIN, EVEN IF HE CAN SAVE A FEW
LIVES.

1428
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
OBVIOUSLY WHAT HE'S REFERRING TO

1429
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
IS LEGISLATION DEALING WITH GUN

1430
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
CONTROL.
>> AND ALSO MENTAL HEALTH

1431
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
ISSUES.

1432
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

1433
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
THINGS POTENTIALLY HE CAN DO.

1434
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
THERE WILL BE A POLITICAL FIGHT.

1435
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
OBVIOUSLY THE HOUSE OF

1436
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
REPRESENTATIVES IN THE SENATE,

1437
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES.

1438
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
HE DID MAKE THAT COMMITMENT, HE
PROMISED HE WAS GOING TO DO, AND

1439
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I THINK MAYOR BLOOMBERG OF NEW

1440
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
YORK WANTS HIM TO DO, NOT JUST

1441
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
TALK A LITTLE BIT, BUT START

1442
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
TAKING SOME ACTION.

1443
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
>> IT'S SOMETHING HE HAD TALKED
ABOUT BEFORE BECOMING PRESIDENT.

1444
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
>> RIGHT.

1445
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
>> BUT NOT SOMETHING HE ACTUALLY

1446
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
PURSUED IN OFFICE.

1447
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
>> HE DIDN'T JUST HAVE PROBLEMS

1448
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
WITH REPUBLICANS WHO ARE OPPOSED

1449
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
TO STRICTER GUN CONTROL.

1450
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
THERE ARE PLENTY OF DEMOCRATS

1451
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
OUT THERE WHO DON'T EVEN WANT TO

1452
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
TALK ABOUT IT.

1453
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
THEY THINK IT'S SUCH A LOSING

1454
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
ISSUE FOR THEM POLITICALLY.

1455
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GET

1456
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
INVOLVED.

1457
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
INCLUDING THE SENATE MAJORITY

1458
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
LEADER, HARRY REID.

1459
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
HE HAS A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES, HE

1460
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
HAS A FISCAL CLIFF.

1461
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
THERE'S A WAR ZONE STILL GOING

1462
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
ON IN AFGHANISTAN.
I THINK HE'S GOING TO DEAL WITH

1463
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
THIS -- YOU KNOW, HE'S IN HIS

1464
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
SECOND TERM, HE DOESN'T THE HAVE

1465
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING
RE-ELECTED.

1466
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'LL SUCCEED.
I'VE BEEN IN WASHINGTON A LONG

1467
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
TIME.

1468
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
GUN CONTROL IS A TOUGH ISSUE BUT

1469
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING HE'LL

1470
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
CERTAINLY TRY.

1471
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
>> A CRIME LIKE THIS HAS SHOCKED

1472
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
THE NATION.
WHETHER IT LEADS TO CHANGE,

1473
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE.

1474
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
ON THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

1475
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
YOU AND SANJAY WERE TALKING

1476
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
ABOUT THIS EARLIER, MENTAL

1477
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
HEALTH IS SOMETHING WHICH IS SO

1478
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
ODDLY DEALT WITH THIS IN

1479
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
COUNTRY --

1480
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
>> RIGHT.
>> IT'S NOT DEALT WITH OR

1481
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
CONSIDERED IN THE SAME WAY AS A

1482
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
DISEASE LIKE CANR.
