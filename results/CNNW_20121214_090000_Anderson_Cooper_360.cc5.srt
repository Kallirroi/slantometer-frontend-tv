1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
>> NOW WE'RE GETTING THERE.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
>> BUT I WAS SUCH A NICE JEWISH

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
GIRL, THAT I SAID, MARLON, I

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
CAN'T STAY OVERFLIGHT WITH YOU.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I I WILL GO WITH YOU FOR THE DAY

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE ME HOME.
>> SO MARLON CLEARLY WANTED TO

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
DO MORE THAN SEE THE FLOWERS

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
WITH YOU.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
>> HE WANTED TO SLEEP IN THE

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
DESERT WITH ME.
>> YOU TURNED DOWN MARLON

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
BRANDO?
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
>> HOW DID HE TAKE REJECTION?

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
>> IT WAS FINE.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
>> A REMARKABLE CONVERSATION

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
WITH A REMARKABLE LADY.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
BARBRA STREISAND WITH ME FOR THE
HOUR TOMORROW NIGHT AT 9:00 P.M.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000

AC 360 STARTS NOW.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
"AC 360" STARTS NOW.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
>>> BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
THE WOMAN BELIEVED TO BE

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIRST CHOICE

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
FOR SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS NO

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
THANKS.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
U.N. AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE.

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
SHE'S THE ONE CAUGHT UP IN THE

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
CONTROVERSY OVER HER STATEMENTS

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF FOUR

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
AMERICANS IN LIBYA.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
SHE'S THE ONE, YOU'LL RECALL,

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
THE PRESIDENT STOOD UP USING

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
SOME PRETTY BLUNT LANGUAGE,

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
SAYING THAT ANYONE WHO'S GOT A

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
PROBLEM WITH HER HAS A PROBLEM

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
WITH HIM.

37
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
INSTEAD, THERE WON'T BE A

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
CONFRONTATION BECAUSE LATE

39
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
TODAY, AMBASSADOR RICE TOOK

40
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
HERSELF OUT OF CONTENTION,

41
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
WRITING THE PRESIDENT SHE'S

42
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
HONORED TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THE

43
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
OFFICE, WRITING "I AM FULLY

44
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
CONFIDENT THAT I COULD SERVE OUR

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
COUNTRY ABLY AND EFFECTIVELY IN

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
THAT ROLE.

47
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
HOWEVER, IF NOMINATED, I AM NOW

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
CONVINCED THAT THE CONFIRMATION
PROCESS WOULD BE LENGTHY,

49
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
DISRUPTIVE AND COSTLY.

50
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
THAT TRADE-OFF IS SIMPLY NOT

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
WORTH IT FOR OUR COUNTRY."

52
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
>> I MADE THE DECISION THAT IT

53
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
WAS THE BEST THING FOR OUR

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
COUNTRY, FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

55
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
THAT I NOT CONTINUE TO BE

56
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
CONSIDERED BY THE PRESIDENT FOR

57
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
NOMINATION AS SECRETARY OF

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
STATE, BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO

59
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
SEE A CONFIRMATION PROCESS THAT

60
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
WAS VERY PROLONGED, VERY

61
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
POLITICIZED, VERY DISTRACTING

62
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
AND VERY DISRUPTIVE, BECAUSE

63
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WE NEED

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
TO GET DONE AS A COUNTRY, AND

65
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
THE FIRST SEVERAL MONTHS OF A

66
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
SECOND-TERM PRESIDENT'S AGENDA

67
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
IS REALLY THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET

68
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
THE CRUCIAL THINGS DONE.

69
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION

71
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
REFORM, BALANCED DEFICIT

72
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
REDUCTION, JOB CREATION.

73
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

74
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT MY

75
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
NOMINATION COULD HAVE DELAYED OR

76
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
DISTRACTED OR DEFLECTED OR MAYBE

77
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
EVEN SOME OF THESE PRIORITIES

78
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE, I DIDN'T

79
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
WANT THAT, AND I'D MUCH PREFER

80
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
TO CONTINUE DOING WHAT I'M

81
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
DOING, WHICH IS A JOB I LOVE AT

82
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
THE UNITED NATIONS.

83
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ACCEPTED HER

84
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
DECISION TO BOW OUT, CALLING HER

85
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
AN EXTRAORDINARILY CAPABLE,

86
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
PATRIOTIC AND PASSIONATE PUBLIC

87
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
SERVANT.
MORE WITH WHAT DECISION AND

88
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
WHO'S THE LEADING CANDIDATE,

89
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
DANA BASH, GLORIA BORGER AND

90
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
DAVID BERGEN.

91
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
WHAT WAS THE PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR

92
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
AMBASSADOR ROSE?

93
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
>> Reporter: NO QUESTION, IT WAS
THE SERIES OF MEETINGS A COUPLE

94
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
WEEKS AGO HERE ON THE HILL,

95
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
FIRST OF ALL WITH HER CHIEF

96
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
REPUBLICAN FOES, SENATORS

97
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
McCAIN, GRAHAM AND AYOTTE, BUT

98
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
MORE IMPORTANTLY IT WAS PROBABLY

99
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
WITH A REPUBLICAN WHO HADN'T

100
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
QUITE MADE UP HER MIND, THE

101
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
MODERATE REPUBLICAN FROM MAINE,

102
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
SUSAN COLLINS.

103
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THAT MEETING

104
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
DID NOT GO WELL AT ALL, BECAUSE

105
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
ACCORDING TO A SOURCE FAMILIAR

106
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
WITH THAT MEETING, SHE DIDN'T

107
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
WANT TO ANSWER REALLY BASIC

108
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
QUESTIONS AND GOT FRUSTRATED AND

109
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE PRICKLY AT

110
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
SOME OF THE BASIC QUESTIONS.

111
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
AND AFTER THAT, THE FEELING EVEN

112
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
AMONG SOME DEMOCRATS WHO TALKED

113
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
TO THESE REPUBLICANS WAS THEY

114
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
REALLY WEREN'T SURE IF SHE CAN'T

115
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
HANDLE MEETINGS WITH U.S.

116
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
SENATORS, HOW IS SHE GOING TO BE

117
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
ON THE WORLD STAGE REPRESENTING

118
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
THE U.S. THERE?

119
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
SO, THAT DEFINITELY WAS AN

120
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
ISSUE.

121
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE

122
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
PRESIDENT IN HIS STATEMENT MADE

123
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
CLEAR THAT HE DIDN'T THINK SUSAN

124
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
RICE WAS TREATED FAIRLY.

125
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE WAS

126
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
POLITICS AT PLAY HERE BY

127
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
REPUBLICANS WHO WERE REALLY,

128
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
REALLY ANGRY ABOUT BENGHAZI, AND

129
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
SHE ILLUSTRATED THAT, BUT IT WAS

130
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
MORE THAN THAT.

131
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
IT WAS ALSO PERSONALITY DRIVEN,

132
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
BECAUSE DEMOCRATS EVEN THINK SHE

133
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
IS VERY SMART AND CAPABLE BUT

134
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
MAYBE DOESN'T HAVE THE

135
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
PERSONALITY FOR THE JOB.
>> GLORIA, I HEARD YOU SAY

136
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
EARLIER THAT YOU THINK

137
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
AMBASSADOR RICE UNDERESTIMATED

138
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THE CLUB.

139
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?

140
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
>> RIGHT.

141
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
THAT WAS FROM A DEMOCRAT VERY

142
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

143
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
SHE SAID THE CLUB IS REALLY

144
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
IMPORTANT ON CAPITOL HILL.

145
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
JOHN KERRY IS THE LEADER IN THAT

146
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
CLUB, JOHN McCAIN LIKES HIM AN

147
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
AWFUL LOT AND WOULD CLEARLY GO

148
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
ALONG WITH THAT NOMINATION.

149
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
ALSO, WHEN SHE TRAVELED UP THERE

150
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
AND SHE WANTED TO GO UP THERE TO

151
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
TALK TO THESE SENATORS, THERE IS

152
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
A SENSE FROM THE SOURCE THAT SHE

153
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
KIND OF OVERESTIMATED HER

154
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
ABILITY TO WOO THEM OVER ON THE

155
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
QUESTION OF BENGHAZI.

156
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
THAT WAS A REALLY BIG

157
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION FOR HER,

158
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
AND DANA JUST POINTED OUT, SHE

159
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
DIDN'T WIN OVER SUSAN COLLINS,

160
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
WHO WAS QUITE IMPORTANT TO HER.

161
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
>> AND DAVID, I MEAN, WHAT DO

162
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
YOU MAKE OF THIS?

163
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
IS THIS JUST A SIGN OF HOW

164
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
PARTISAN THINGS HAVE BECOME, OR

165
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
WAS IT PRETTY CLEAR FROM AS SOON

166
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
AS THE CONTROVERSY OVER

167
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
BENGHAZI, THE COMMENTS BEGAN,

168
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN?

169
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
>> I DON'T THINK THIS IS JUST

170
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
ABOUT PARTISANSHIP, AND I ALSO

171
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
DON'T THINK IT'S JUST ABOUT

172
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
BENGHAZI.
THAT WAS AN ISSUE, OF COURSE,

173
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
BUT IN THIS CASE, THERE ARE A

174
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
NUMBER OF SENATORS ON BOTH SIDES

175
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
OF THE AISLE WHO BELIEVE THAT

176
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
THE UNITED STATES HAS SOME TOUGH

177
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
WORK AHEAD IN INTERNATIONAL

178
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
RELATIONS.
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE HAS GOT TO GO

179
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
AND NEGOTIATION WITH THE

180
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
IRANIANS TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T

181
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
GET INTO A CONFLICT OVER THERE

182
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
AND SOMEONE WITH THE KIND OF

183
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
TOUGHNESS AND AUTHORITY OF A JIM

184
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
BAKER.

185
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
AND FRANKLY, THERE WAS A SENSE

186
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
ABOUT SUSAN RICE THAT, EVEN

187
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
THOUGH SHE IS VERY TALENTED AND

188
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I THINK SHE DID A GENEROUS THING

189
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
TODAY BY WITHDRAWING, SHE REALLY

190
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
WAS LOYAL TO HER PRESIDENT BY

191
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
DOING THAT, BUT THERE WAS ALSO A

192
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
SENSE THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE

193
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
WEIGHT, SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE

194
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
BACKGROUND THAT SENATOR KERRY

195
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
DOES, AND HE IS EXTREMELY

196
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
SCHOOLED AND KNOWS THE ROUGH

197
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
PARTS OF THE WORLD.

198
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
AND THERE WAS A SENSE IN THE

199
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
SENATE, YOU KNOW, THAT PEOPLE

200
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
THERE WOULD JUST BE MORE

201
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
COMFORTABLE WITH HIM

202
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
REPRESENTING THE UNITED STATES.
>> DAVID, WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS

203
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
SAYS ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA

204
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
HIMSELF, BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY

205
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
SEEMED LIKE, ESPECIALLY IN THE

206
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
LAST MONTH OR SO, THAT HE WAS

207
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
DIGGING IN HIS HEELS PREPARING

208
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
FOR A FIGHT?

209
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
>> WELL, IT DID SEEM LIKE THAT,

210
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
AND THERE WAS ALSO -- YOU KNOW,

211
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
THERE HAD BEEN VARIOUS REPORTS
THAT HE'S BEEN AGONIZING OVER

212
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
THIS CHOICE, AND IN A SENSE, SHE

213
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
LET HIM OFF.

214
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
SHE RECOGNIZES AGONY AND REMOVED

215
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
IT.

216
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I THINK ONE CAN READ INTO THIS

217
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
THAT HE DOESN'T WANT A SERIES OF

218
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
FIGHTS WITH REPUBLICANS ACROSS

219
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
THE BOARD.
HE'S GOT A BIG FIGHT ON HIS

220
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
HANDS ON THE FISCAL CLIFF, AND

221
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
YOU KNOW, IT MAY BE ONE STRUGGLE

222
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
TOO MANY WHEN HE WANTS TO GET

223
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
HIS SECOND TERM OFF AND RUNNING

224
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
AND HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE

225
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
ENSNARED LIKE THIS.

226
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
THIS HAPPENS TO PRESIDENTS, AND

227
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
WE'VE HAD SOME REALLY GOOD

228
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT MADE IT
THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

229
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I REMEMBER SO WELL THE ICONIC

230
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
FIGURE TED SORENSEN, WHO WAS

231
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
NOMINATED TO BE CIA CHIEF, AND

232
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
IT SORT OF JUST FELL APART AFTER

233
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
TIME, AND TED SORENSEN WENT ON

234
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
TO GREAT THINGS AND HE'LL BE

235
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
WELL REMEMBERED, BUT IT WAS A

236
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
TOUGH CHAPTER IN HIS LIFE.

237
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
>> ANDERSON, YOU WERE JUST

238
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
TALKING ABOUT THE SENATE BEING

239
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
MORE COMFORTABLE WITH JOHN

240
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
KERRY.
I THINK IN A WAY, THE PRESIDENT

241
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE

242
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
COMFORTABLE WITH SUSAN RICE.

243
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
SHE'S AN OLD FRIEND OF HIS.

244
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
IT'S NOT THAT HE DOESN'T LIKE

245
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
JOHN KERRY.

246
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
JOHN KERRY HELPED HIM OUT DURING

247
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
THE DEBATES, HE'S KNOWN HIM FOR

248
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
A LONG TIME.

249
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
SUSAN RICE IS A DEAR OLD FRIEND,

250
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S ANOTHER

251
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
ISSUE HERE, WHICH IS THE

252
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
QUESTION OF DIVERSITY.

253
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
BECAUSE IF IT SORT OF ALL STACKS

254
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
UP AS WE THINK IT'S GOING, IT

255
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
LOOKS LIKE THE TOP FOUR CABINET

256
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
POSTS COULD NOW POTENTIALLY BE

257
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
FILLED BY MEN, AND I'M SURE THAT

258
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
THAT'S SOMETHING THE WHITE HOUSE

259
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
REALLY IS THINKING ABOUT.

260
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
>> AND DANA, I MEAN, THIS TEAM

261
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THAT LOOKS TO BE FALLING INTO

262
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
PLACE, HUCHUCK HAGEL TALKING ABT

263
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
REPLACING PANETTA, DOES IT SEEM

264
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
LIKE IT WILL PASS CONFIRMATION

265
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
IN THE SENATE IF JOHN KERRY IS

266
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
THE CANDIDATE?

267
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
>> IT DOES, UNLESS THERE'S

268
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
SOMETHING WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT,

269
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
LIKE IF SENATE MINORITY LEADER,

270
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
TOM DASCHLE, AN IMPORTANT MEMBER

271
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
OF THE CLUB, HE DIDN'T MAKE IT

272
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
THROUGH BECAUSE OF A SURPRISE

273
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
ISSUE WITH TAX RETURNS.

274
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
WITH JOHN KERRY, EVEN THE

275
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
REPUBLICAN LEADER LATE TODAY

276
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
SAID KIND WORDS ABOUT HIM.

277
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
IT IS VIRTUALLY SURE THAT HE IS

278
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
GOING TO GET THROUGH THE SENATE

279
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN VETTED IN

280
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
MANY WAYS BECAUSE HE WAS THE

281
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

282
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
YOU DON'T GET MORE VETTED THAN

283
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
THAT.

284
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
WITH REGARD TO CHUCK HAGEL, SAME

285
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
THING, HE IS SOMEBODY WHO MAYBE

286
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
DIDN'T HAVE THE CLOSEST

287
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
RELATIONSHIPS HERE, BUT THE FACT

288
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
THAT IT WOULD BE A BIPARTISAN

289
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
PICK, SINCE HE'S A REPUBLICAN,

290
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
WOULD GO A LONG WAY LIKELY.

291
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
SO, YES, IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT'S

292
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
SHAPING UP.
THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY ABOUT

293
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
SUSAN RICE, THE SORT OF VETTING

294
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
HERE ON CAPITOL HILL, IS THE

295
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
PRESIDENT IS MAYBE LOOKING AT

296
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
HER TO BE NATIONAL SECURITY

297
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
ADVISER.

298
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
SHE WOULDN'T NEED SENATE

299
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
CONFIRMATION.

300
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
>> INTERESTING.
THANK YOU.

301
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
>>> POLITICS NOW AND HIGH STAKES

302
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
WHEN IT COMES TO THE TAXES YOU

303
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
PAY, THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT, THE

304
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
ECONOMY, THE WORKS.

305
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND JOHN BOEHNER

306
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
BACK AT IT TONIGHT TRYING ONCE

307
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
AGAIN TO REACH A DEAL ON THE

308
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
FISCAL CLIFF.
THE QUESTION IS, WILL IT BE ANY

309
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
DIFFERENT THIS TIME?

310
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
LET'S CHECK WITH JESSICA YELLIN.

311
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
>> HEY, ANDERSON.

312
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
TONIGHT THE TWO MET FOR 50

313
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
MINUTES IN THE OVAL OFFICE AS

314
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
THEY STRUGGLED TO FIND A WAY OUT

315
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
OF THIS STALEMATE, AND SO FAR,

316
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
NO WORD OF BREAKTHROUGH.

317
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
AIDES TO BOTH MEN DESCRIBE THE

318
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
CONVERSATION AS FRANK, AND WE'RE

319
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
TOLD THAT LINES OF COMMUNICATION

320
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
REMAIN OPEN.

321
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
NOW, THAT IS POLITICAL SPEAK,

322
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
AND I WILL TRANSLATE IT FOR YOU.

323
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
FRANK, THAT GENERALLY MEANS THAT

324
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
THE CONVERSATION WAS SOMEWHAT

325
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
TENSE.
LINES OF COMMUNICATION REMAINS

326
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
OPEN, THAT MEANS THAT THE TWO

327
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
MEN'S STAFF WILL CONTINUE

328
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
TALKING.
AND IN FACT, I'VE CONFIRMED THAT

329
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
THERE IS NO CURRENT PLAN FOR THE

330
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
TWO MEN, THE PRESIDENT AND

331
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER, TO HAVE A

332
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
FOLLOW-UP MEETING AS OF YET, AND

333
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER DOES PLAN TO

334
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
RETURN HOME TO OHIO TOMORROW.

335
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
NOW, THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR A

336
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
DEAL TO COME TOGETHER BECAUSE

337
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

338
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
THEY ARE ALL BUT OUT OF TIME TO

339
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
GET A DEAL DONE BEFORE THE

340
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
CHRISTMAS DEADLINE AND NEXT TO

341
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
OUT OF TIME TO GET ONE DONE

342
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
BEFORE THE NEW YEAR, ANDERSON.

343
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
>> JESSICA, THANKS VERY MUCH.

344
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THIN

345
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
THINK, @ANDERSONCOOPER.

346
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'LL BE TWEETING TONIGHT.

347
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
>>> NEXT, AN OUT BREAK OF A

348
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
DEADLY DISEASE AND ALLEGATIONS

349
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
OF WHAT THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM KNEW

350
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
ABOUT THE RISK.
ñç@RÑo

351
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
>>> KEEPING THEM HONEST NOW,

352
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
LOOKING FOR FACTS TONIGHT, NOT

353
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
OFFERING OPINIONS OR PLAYING

354
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
FAVORITES.

355
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
OUR GOAL TONIGHT IS REAL

356
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
REPORTING, AS IT IS EVERY NIGHT,

357
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
FINDING TRUTH AND CALLING OUT

358
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
HYPOCRISY, BUT TONIGHT THE

359
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
STAKES ARE LIFE AND DEATH.

360
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
EVERY YEAR, MILLIONS OF

361
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
AMERICANS PUT THEIR LIFE ON THE

362
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
LINE FOR THE COUNTRY CHECK INTO

363
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
VA HOSPITALS.

364
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
ALL DESERVE THE BEST CARE

365
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
POSSIBLE.

366
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
CERTAINLY, NONE SHOULD EVER

367
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
EXPECT THAT A TRIP TO THE

368
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
HOSPITAL MIGHT MAKE THEM SICK OR

369
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
EVEN KILL THEM, YET ONE

370
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
PITTSBURGH AREA FAMILY SAYS THAT

371
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO

372
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
THEIR DAD AND THEY'RE FINDING

373
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
MORE CASES LIKE HIS.

374
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
HE WAS TREATED IN PITTSBURGH'S

375
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
VA HOSPITAL SYSTEM, ONE OF THE

376
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
MOST HIGHLY REGARDED IN THE

377
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
NATION, AND THEY HAVE DIED
BECAUSE OF WHAT HE CAUGHT THERE,

378
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE, A

379
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
POTENTIALLY DEADLY BACTERIAL

380
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
INFECTION THAT SPREADS IN

381
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
CONTAMINATED WATER SUPPLIES.

382
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
AND WHAT MAKES THIS STORY EVEN

383
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
MORE TROUBLING IS THE EVIDENCE

384
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
THAT CNN HAS NOW UNCOVERED.

385
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
IT SHOWS THAT HOSPITAL OFFICIALS

386
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
KNEW ABOUT THE PROBLEM, AND YET

387
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
APPARENTLY, THEY FAILED TO FIX

388
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
IT.
BUT SINCE JANUARY OF LAST YEAR,

389
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
LAST YEAR, THERE HAVE BEEN AT

390
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
LEAST FIVE CASES DIRECTLY

391
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
TRACEABLE TO THE VA HOSPITAL

392
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
SYSTEM IN PITTSBURGH, BUT ONLY

393
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
LAST MONTH DID THE VA ADMIT THEY

394
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
HAD A PROBLEM WITH THEIR WATER

395
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
SUPPLY.
THEY SAID SO IN A NEWS RELEASE

396
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
AND ISSUED TWO MORE, INCLUDING

397
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
ONE THAT SAID THE PROBLEM HAS

398
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
BEEN SOLVED.

399
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
APART FROM NEWS RELEASES,

400
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
THOUGH, THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT

401
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
TALKING.

402
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
DREW GRIFFIN TONIGHT IS
INVESTIGATING.

403
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
>> WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE VA

404
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
WAS GOING TO GIVE HIM THE BEST

405
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
CARE THEY COULD POSSIBLY GIVE

406
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
HIM.

407
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
>> Reporter: KNOWING WHAT YOU
KNOW NOW, DID THE VA GIVE HIM

408
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE?

409
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
>> NO, NO, THEY DIDN'T.

410
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I MEAN, I CAN SAY THERE WAS

411
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
STRONG NEGLIGENCE ON THE VA'S

412
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
PART.

413
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
>> Reporter: BOB NICKLAS IS

414
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
TALKING ABOUT HIS FATHER, BILL,

415
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
A WORLD WAR II NAVY HERO WHO

416
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
WOULD DROP INTO HOSTILE WATERS

417
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
TO SAVE DOWNED NAVY PILOTS.

418
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
BUT BILL NICKLAS DIED THE DAY

419
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
AFTER THANKSGIVING FROM HEART

420
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
FAILURE AND LEGIONNAIRES'

421
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
DISEASE.
HE CONTRACTED IT FROM USING THE

422
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
WATER AT THE VA, WHICH WAS

423
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
CONTAMINATED WITH HIGH LEVELS OF
A BACTERIA KNOWN AS LEGIONELLA,

424
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
THE CAUSE OF LEGIONNAIRES'

425
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
DISEASE.
TWO OTHER FAMILIES ARE WONDERING

426
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
WHETHER THEIR VETERANS

427
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
CONTRACTED THE LEGIONNAIRES'

428
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
DISEASE THAT KILLED THEM FROM

429
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
THIS SAME PITTSBURGH VA.

430
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
CNN HAS NOW LEARNED THAT

431
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
HOSPITAL OFFICIALS KNEW THEY HAD
A PROBLEM WITH THE WATER SYSTEM

432
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
AS FAR BACK AS DECEMBER OF LAST

433
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
YEAR BUT CHOSE NOT TO REVEAL ANY

434
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
OF THAT PUBLICLY UNTIL A MONTH

435
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
AGO.
>> BEING A VETERAN MYSELF, I'M

436
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
SHOCKED AND APPALLED THAT THE VA

437
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
WOULD PUT, YOU KNOW, THEIR

438
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
VETERANS IN THAT TYPE OF

439
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
SITUATION.
>> Reporter: RECORDS OBTAINED BY

440
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
CNN SHOW THAT OVER THE PAST

441
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
YEAR, THE AMOUNT OF DISINFECTANT

442
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
IN THE VA'S WATER WAS LESS THAN

443
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
THE AMOUNT NEEDED TO PREVENT

444
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
LEGIONELLA BACTERIA FROM

445
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
REACHING DANGEROUS LEVELS.

449
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
OF 2011, AN INFECTION FOUND THEY

450
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
HAVE LEGIONELLA.

451
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
"SYSTEMS ARE NOT BEING PROPERLY

452
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
MAINTAINED."
A SITE VISIT BY THE SAME COMPANY

453
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
FIVE MONTHS LATER FOUND THE

454
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
PROBLEMS CONTINUED, OBVIOUS

455
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
EVIDENCE THAT THE SYSTEMS HAD

456
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
NOT BEEN PROPERLY, REGULARLY

457
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
MAINTAINED.

458
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
LIQUITECH IS THE CONTRACTOR WHO

459
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
INSTALLED THE VA'S WATER SYSTEM

460
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
AND A SYSTEM LIKE IT IN HUNDREDS

461
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
OF OTHER HOSPITALS ACROSS THE

462
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
COUNTRY.

463
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
HE SAYS IT IS INEXPLICABLE THAT

464
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
THE VA HOSPITAL IN PITTSBURGH

465
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
KNEW IT HAD A PROBLEM, WAS

466
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
WARNED ABOUT IT, AND DID NOT FIX

467
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
IT.
>> THEY WERE NOT CLEANING THE

468
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
FLOW CELLS, THEY WERE NOT DOING

469
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
THE MONITORING, THEY WERE NOT

470
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
DOING THE THINGS THAT ARE
CRITICAL TO THE EFFICACY OF THE

471
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
SYSTEM.

472
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
>> Reporter: AND DID YOU TELL
THE HOSPITAL?

473
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
>> YES, WE DID.
YES, WE DID.

474
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
WE TOLD THEM -- WE ACTUALLY HAD

475
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
TWO AUDITS AND TOLD THEM TWICE

476
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
THAT THEY WERE DEFICIENT IN

477
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
THEIR MAINTENANCE.

478
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
>> Reporter: WHAT IS SO

479
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
FRUSTRATING TO SHIRA IS IF THE

480
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
SYSTEM HAD JUST BEEN MAINTAINED,

481
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
IF THE HOSPITAL HAD JUST

482
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
LISTENED AND MADE SIMPLE

483
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
ADJUSTMENTS, HE SAYS HE BELIEVES

484
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED.

485
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
>> ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.

486
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
>> Reporter: 100%?

487
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000

488
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000

THE OTHER HOSPITALS THAT YOU

490

SERVE?
>> YES.

491
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
>> THIS OUTBREAK WAS ABSOLUTELY

492
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
PREVENTIBLE.

PAST WEEKEND.

EVEN BETTER THAN THE NORMAL

COUNTRY, YOU KNOW, THEY GO TO

LOVE THEIR COUNTRY AND WHERE DO

590
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
THEY GO?
THEY GO TO A HOSPITAL AND THEY

591
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
BASICALLY DIE IN THERE.

592
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
>> Reporter: ANDERSON, LET ME

593
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

594
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
BILL NICKLAS.

595
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
THIS GUY DRAFTED AT 17 YEARS OLD

596
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
INTO THE U.S. NAVY.

597
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
HE WOULD DRIVE 30 MILES OUT OF

598
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
HIS WAY, PAST TWO OTHER

599
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
HOSPITALS, JUST TO GO TO THE VA

600
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE WOULD GET

601
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
BETTER CARE THERE AS A VETERAN,

602
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
WHICH IS WHY HIS SONS REALLY

603
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
FEEL LET DOWN BY THIS.

604
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
>> WE KNOW OF THREE POSSIBLE

605
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
DEATHS DUE TO THIS LEGIONELLA AT

606
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
THE HOSPITAL, BUT THERE ACTUALLY

607
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
COULD BE MORE DEATHS, RIGHT?

608
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
>> Reporter: CERTAINLY.
ALL THE INFORMATION ON THESE

609
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
CASES, 29 CASES, IS COMING FROM

610
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
THE HOSPITAL.

611
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A

612
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
YEAR NOW, ANDERSON.

613
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I THINK A LOT OF HEALTH CARE

614
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
PROFESSIONALS, A LOT OF

615
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
FAMILIES, QUITE FRANKLY, ARE

616
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
GOING TO LOOK BACK OVER THIS

617
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
YEAR, LOOK BACK AT THE FAMILY

618
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
MEMBERS THEY MAY HAVE LOST AND

619
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
BEGIN ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT

620
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
WHAT THIS WAS THAT KILLED THEIR

621
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
LOVED ONE.

622
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
COULD IT HAVE BEEN THIS

623
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE?
>> AND WHO BESIDES US ARE TRYING

624
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
TO GET ANSWERS ON THIS, AND IS

625
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
THE VA STILL REFUSING TO TALK TO

626
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
YOU?
>> Reporter: YEAH, THEY WILL NOT

627
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
COME OUT.
AS YOU SAW IN THAT PIECE, THEY

628
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
WILL NOT TALK TO US AT ALL.

629
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
THEY REFERRED US TO THE

630
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
WASHINGTON PR DIVISION, SENT US

631
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
RIGHT BACK TO PITTSBURGH.

632
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
IT'S BEEN A MESS.

633
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
BUT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE

634
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
CONTROL AND PREVENTION, THEY DID

635
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
SEND A TEAM THERE IN NOVEMBER TO

636
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
INVESTIGATE THIS.

637
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
WE'RE TOLD THAT THE

638
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
INVESTIGATION, THE RESULTS FROM

639
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
THE CDC WILL GO TO THE VA IN

640
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
COMING WEEKS.

641
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
WE'RE NOT SURE IF THAT'S GOING

642
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
TO BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC.

643
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
>> AND I STILL CAN'T UNDERSTAND

644
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
WHY THE VA DID NOTHING WHEN THEY

645
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
KNEW THEY HAD A PROBLEM.

646
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
>> Reporter: ACTUALLY, ANDERSON,

647
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
WE FOUND OUT THAT ABOUT SIX

648
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
MONTHS AGO, THE VA DID BRING IN

649
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
A CONSULTANT WHO MADE

650
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO FIX

651
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
THE WATER, BUT THE VA APPARENTLY

652
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
DID NOT TELL THAT CONSULTANT

653
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
THAT THEY HAD LEGIONNAIRES CASES

654
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
AT THE HOSPITAL.

655
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
IF THEY HAD TOLD THE CONSULTANTS

656
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
THAT, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN

657
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS, THE

658
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
VA WOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD TO

659
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
HANDLE IT DIFFERENTLY, AND WE

660
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
JUST DON'T KNOW WHY, BECAUSE THE

661
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
VA WON'T TALK TO US.

662
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
>> UNBELIEVABLE.

663
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
DREW, APPRECIATE IT.

664
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
TO THE WARD TREATING CATHERINE,

920
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
THE DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE.

921
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT THE

922
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING HER

923
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
DEATH.

924
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
>>> CRIME AND PUNISHMENT.

925
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
A MOTHER WHOSE YOUNG CHILDREN

926
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
WERE VICIOUSLY STABBED TO DEATH
IS REELING TONIGHT.

927
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
THEIR KILLER IS BACK ON THE

928
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
STREETS.
HE WAS RELEASED FROM A MENTAL

929
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
HEALTH FACILITY JUST YESTERDAY.

930
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
THE CASE IS AS CONTROVERSIAL AS

931
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
IT IS HORRIFYING.

932
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
5-YEAR-OLD OLIVIER AND HIS

933
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
3-YEAR-OLD SISTER ANN SOPHIE

934
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
WERE STABBED TO DEATH IN THEIR
OWN BEDS.

935
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
EACH CHILD HAD MORE THAN A DOZEN
WOUNDS.

936
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
AS HORRIBLE AS THOSE FACTS ALONE

937
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
ARE, IT GETS WORSE.

938
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
THEIR FATHER, A PHYSICIAN, IS

939
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
THE ONE WHO KILLED THEM AND HE

940
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
CONFESSED.
BUT A CANADIAN JURY RULED THAT

941
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
HE WASN'T CRIMINALLY RESPONSIBLE
BECAUSE OF HIS MENTAL STATE AT

942
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
THE TIME.

943
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
INSTEAD OF PRISON, HE WAS SENT

944
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
TO A MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY.

945
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
NOW HE'S FREE AND HE HAS NO
CRIMINAL RECORD.

946
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
HIS EX-WIFE, WHO'S ALSO A

947
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
DOCTOR, FOUGHT HARD TO KEEP THAT

948
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
FROM HAPPENING.

949
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
PAULA NEWTON HAS MORE.

POURS OVER HER OWN CHILDREN'S

AUTOPSY REPORTS, SHE WISHES SHE
HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY MEANT.

953
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
BUT AS A PHYSICIAN AND A

954
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
CORONER, SHE KNOWS IT'S TRUE.

955
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
HER CHILDREN SUFFERED LONG,

956
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
GRUESOME DEATHS.

957
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
>> I KNEW THAT IT WAS NOT A

958
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
SHORT DEATH.

959
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
MY LITTLE BOY RECEIVED 20 -- 20

960
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
STABS OF A KNIFE.

961
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
HE HAD SEVEN MARKS OF DEFENSE.

962
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
HE HAD NO WOUND THAT WAS THE ONE

963
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
THAT GAVE HIM DEATH.

964
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
>> THERE WAS NO MERCY?

965
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
>> NO.

966
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
MY LITTLE GIRL HAD 19 WOUNDS.

967
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
MAYBE SHE WAS LUCKIER BECAUSE

968
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
SHE HAD ONE THAT WAS MORE MORTAL

969
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
THAN THE OTHER, BUT SHE FELT THE

970
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
19 SHOTS FOR SURE.

971
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
>> Reporter: BUT THIS WAS NO

972
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
RANDOM ACT OF VIOLENCE.

973
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
THE KNIFE WAS WIELDED BY THE

974
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
CHILDREN'S FATHER AND GASTON'S

975
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
EX-HUSBAND, CARDIOLOGIST DR. GUY
TURCOTTE.

976
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
>> TO KNOW THAT MY CHILDREN

977
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
FACED THE PERSON THAT THEY

978
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
SHOULD TRUST THE MOST AND THEY

979
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
WERE LEFT BY THEMSELVES TO DIE,

980
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
NO ONE HOLDING THEIR HAND, I

981
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
STRUGG

982
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
STRUGGLE, OKAY.

983
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I STRUGGLE ALL THE DAY, EVERY

984
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
DAY OF MY LIFE, AND UNTIL I DIE

985
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I WILL STRUGGLE.

986
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
>> Reporter: DR. TURCOTTE ADMITS

987
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
HE KILLED HIS CHILDREN IN 2009,

988
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
AND YET NOW HE IS A FREE MAN,

989
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
EVEN POSSIBLY FREE TO PRACTICE

990
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
MEDICINE AGAIN.

991
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
IN 2010, A CANADIAN JURY FAILED

992
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
TO CONVICT TURCOTTE OF THE

993
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
MURDERS, FINDING HIM NOT

994
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
CRIMINALLY RESPONSIBLE DUE TO

995
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
MENTAL ILLNESS.

996
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
DR. TURCOTTE KILLED HIS CHILDREN

997
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
ON WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A

998
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
FAMILY MOVIE NIGHT.

999
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
THIS SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWS

1000
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
HIM RENTING VIDEOS WITH HIS

1001
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
CHILDREN JUST HOURS BEFORE HE

1002
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
BRUTALLY STABBED THEM IN THEIR
BEDS.

1003
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
THESE WERE TROUBLING TIMES FOR

1004
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
DR. TURCOTTE.

1005
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
HE WAS SEPARATED FROM HIS WIFE.
SHE HAD LEFT HIM FOR ANOTHER

1006
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
MAN.

1007
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
DR. TURCOTTE SAYS HE SUFFERED A

1008
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
BLACKOUT AND DOES NOT REMEMBER
STABBING THE CHILDREN.

1009
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
THE VERDICT IS BEING APPEALED.

1010
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
DO YOU BELIEVE HE WAS MENTALLY

1011
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
INSANE WHEN HE COMMITTED THE

1012
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
MURDERS, AND DO YOU BELIEVE HE'S

1013
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
MENTALLY INSANE NOW?

1014
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
>> NO, NO.

1015
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
>> Reporter: WHY?

1016
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
>> WHY SHOULD I, THAT I DON'T

1017
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
ACCEPT HE IS MENTALLY ILL, WHEN

1018
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I LOOK AT THE FACTS, OKAY.

1019
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
WE HAVE A PERSON THAT'S A

1020
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
CARDIOLOGIST THAT HAS NEVER HAD
A PSYCHIATRIC INCIDENT, NEVER,

1021
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
NOT AT ALL.

1022
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
>> Reporter: THE JURY, THOUGH,

1023
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
BELIEVED THE TESTIMONY OF TWO

1024
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
PSYCHIATRISTS PRESENTED BY THE
DEFENSE.

1025
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
THEY TESTIFIED THAT DR. TURCOTTE

1026
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN WHAT HE WAS

1027
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
DOING WHEN HE REPEATEDLY STABBED

1028
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
5-YEAR-OLD OLIVIER AND

1029
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
3-YEAR-OLD ANN SOPHIE.

1030

>> I'M A LITTLE BIT MAD BECAUSE

1031
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO RESPECT

1032

THEIR DECISION.

1033
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
SO, IT CONFRONTS ME AND MY

1034
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
VALUES, BUT I THINK THEY DIDN'T
DO THEIR JOB.

1035

THE ONLY CONDITIONS OF HIS

1041
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
RELEASE ARE THAT HE CONTINUE

00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
WITH THERAPY AND STAY AWAY FROM

1043
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
HIS EX-WIFE AND HER FAMILY.

1044
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000

REVIEW PANEL THAT RELEASED HIM

1046
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000

DR. GASTON SAYS SHE FEARS FOR

1054
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
HER LIFE NOW, AND BELIEVES THE

1055
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
PSYCHIATRISTS THAT TESTIFIED ON

1056
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
HIS BEHALF DID NOT EVALUATE HIM

1057
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
LONG ENOUGH.

1058
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
SHE IS CALLING FOR STRICTER

SHE SAYS SHE HAS NEVER BELIEVED

1062

HER EX-HUSBAND WAS MENTALLY ILL,

1063
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
AND EVEN IF HE WAS, HE COULD NOT

1064
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
NOW BE CURED IN LITTLE MORE THAN

1065
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
THREE YEARS.

1066
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000

QUESTION.

AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M VERY

1071

CONVINCED AND I'M WILLING TO
LOSE MY HEALTH, I'M WILLING TO

GOING TO GIVE ME, IF HE DOESN'T

INVENT EVERYTHING, AND THAT'S

1088

1104
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT.

1105
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
THE OUTRAGE STEMS FROM TWO
THING.

1106
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
HEADLINES, LOOK, ANDERSON, THIS

1108
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
GUY STABBED HIS CHILDREN 46

1109
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
TIMES, HE CONFESSED TO IT.

1110
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
HE SERVED 46 MONTHS, NOT ALL OF

1111
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
IT IN PRISON.

1112
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
HE IS A FREE MAN RIGHT NOW.

1113
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
ADD TO THAT THAT THE MENTAL

1114
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
FACILITY ACTUALLY SAID, LOOK,

1115
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
THIS GUY DOES PRESENT A RISK TO

1116
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
SOCIETY.

1117
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
WE DON'T KNOW HOW HE'LL BEHAVE

1118
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
IN THE FUTURE, BUT HE NEEDS TO

1119
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
BE FREE AND WE CAN MANAGE THAT
RISK.

1120
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
ANDERSON, I'LL REMIND YOU, THERE

1121
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000

1122
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
FOLLOWING HIM AROUND, NOT

1123
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT, AND THE

1124
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
PUBLIC WANTS TO KNOW WHY.

1125
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
>> I MEAN, THAT'S JUST

1126
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
INCREDIBLE.

1127
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
AND FOR SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF

1128
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000

OTHER OUTRAGEOUS THING PEOPLE

ARE TELLING ME.
IN HIS TESTIMONY AS TO WHY HE

1134
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
WANTED TO BE RELEASED, HE SAID
HE WANTED TO LEAD A NORMAL LIFE.

1135
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
ANDERSON, HE'S GOING TO APPLY

1136
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
AGAIN TO PRACTICE MEDICINE.

1137
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
HE IS A CARDIOLOGIST.

1138
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS

1139
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
AGAINST HIM IN TERMS OF THE KIND

1140
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
OF CARE HE HAD FOR HIS PARENTS.

1141
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
PATIENTS.

1142
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
HE IS FREE TO BE A DOCTOR AGAIN

1143
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
IF HE GETS LICENSED ONCE MORE.

1144
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000

1149
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
PAULA NEWTON WILL CONTINUE TO

MYSTERY WITH A TWIST.
DOLPHINS ARE TURNING UP DEAD

1153
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
ALONG THE GULF COAST BUT WHO OR

1154
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
WHAT IS KILLING THEM?

1155
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,000
ED LAVANDERA HAS A SPECIAL

THE DISCOVERY IS GRUESOME,

1163
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
DISTURBING AND FRANKLY BAFFLING.
COULD IT BE THE WORK OF SOME

1164
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
KIND OF A SERIAL KILLER?

1165
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
IF SO, WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO

1166
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
HARM DOLPHINS?

1167
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

THIS YEAR, SEVEN SLAIN DOLPHINS

1201
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000

RECENTLY FOUND ON A BEACH.

1210
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000

IN COMMON IS ALL THESE DOLPHINS

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
HAVE TURNED UP ALONG THESE

1214
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
LITTLE BARRIER ISLANDS ALONG THE
GULF COAST?

1215
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000

THERE NOW COULD BE AS MANY AS

TEN MURDERED DOLPHINS, THE

IT'S REALLY SENSELESS.

1233
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
IT'S REPUGNANT, IT'S ILLEGAL.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT TYPE OF

1234
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
PERSON WOULD DO SUCH A CRUEL

1235
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000

THE DEAD DOLPHINS A FEW WEEKS

1239
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
AGO, WE ASKED FEDERAL

1240
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
INVESTIGATORS IF THEY THOUGHT

1241
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
THIS COULD BE THE WORK OF A

1242
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
DOLPHIN SERIAL KILLER OR

1243
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
KILLERS.

1244
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
THEY TOLD US THEN THAT THAT WAS

1245
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
NOT ONE OF THEIR THEORIES, BUT

1246
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
SINCE THEN, THREE MORE DOLPHINS

1247
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
HAVE WASHED ASHORE, AND THOSE

1248
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS NOW SAY

1249
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
THEY CAN'T COMMENT ON AN ACTIVE

CLOSE.

00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
WERE YOU ABLE TO SEE ANYTHING

1254
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
THAT KIND OF LEADS YOU TO

1255
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
BELIEVE THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

1256
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
THE WORK OF ONE PERSON?

1257
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
>> WELL, IT'S REALLY HARD FOR US

1258
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
TO DO, BECAUSE ALL WE CAN DO AS

WEEKS AGO THEY THINK THE MURDERS

1267
