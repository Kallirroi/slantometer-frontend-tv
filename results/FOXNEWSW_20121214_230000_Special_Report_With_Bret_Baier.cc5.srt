WHO HAD SIMPLY COME TO SCHOOL

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
TO LEARN.

21

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
WAY THAN WE COULD HAVE

IMAGINED.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
AS WE STAND HERE TODAY WE

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT TRANSPIRED

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
THERE.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
EVIL VISITED THIS COMMUNITY

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
TODAY.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
IT'S TOO EARLY TO SPEAK OF

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
RECOVERY.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
BUT EACH PARENT, EACH SIBLING,

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
EACH MEMBER OF THE FAMILY HAS

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
TO UNDERSTAND THAT

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
CONNECTICUT, WE'RE ALL IN THIS

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
TOGETHER.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
WE'LL DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
OVERCOME THIS EVENT.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
WE WILL GET THROUGH IT.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
BUT THIS IS A TERRIBLE TIME

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
FOR THIS COMMUNITY AND FOR

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
THESE FAMILIES.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
OUR POLICE PERSONNEL AND

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
OTHERS ARE DOING THE UTMOST TO

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
CLEAR THIS SITUATION AS SOON

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
AS POSSIBLE.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
TO RETURN THESE CHILDREN TO

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
THEIR PARENTS.

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
OR THESE LOVED ONES TO THEIR

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
WE'LL WORK WITH ALL OF THE

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
AND CONNECTICUT TO MAKE SURE

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
THAT WE DO, IN FACT, GET

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
THROUGH THIS.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I WAS MAYOR OF STANFORD ON

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
9/11.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
WHEN OUR STATE LOST MANY OF

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
ITS CITIZENS AND I LOST A

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
NUMBER OF MY FELLOW CITIZENS

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
AND FRIENDS.

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT IN A

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
PUBLIC CAREER THAT I WOULD

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
HAVE TO FACE THESE KIND OF

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
CIRCUMSTANCES OR THAT THEY

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
WOULD VISIT THEMSELVES UPON

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THIS COMMUNITY OR THE PEOPLE

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
OF CONNECTICUT.

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
AND OUR PRAYERS, AT THIS TIME

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
HAVE TO GO OUT TO THE

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
THANKING THOSE WITH EXPRESSED

THEIR DESIRES TO BE HELPFUL,

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
NUMBER ONE, WAY TO BE HELPFUL

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
IS TO SAY A PRAYER.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
OR SEND A BEST WISH, THINKING

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000

CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILIES OF

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
ALL OF THOSE VICTIMS WHO

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000

103

HANG, WHICH IS IN NEWTOWN,

THAT SCHOOL BEFORE KILLING

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
HIMSELF.
WE HAVE NOW LEARNED THAT ADAM

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
LANZA LIVED WITH HIS MOTHER

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
HERE IN CONNECTICUT.
WOKE UP THIS MORNING,

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000

THEN TOOK HER CAR AND WENT TO

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
HER SCHOOL AND THAT IS WHERE

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
THIS HORRIBLE SHOOTING

TRANSPIRED.

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
HE KILLED 18 KIDS AT THE

126
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000

TWO CHILDREN WERE FOUND THERE

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
AND MOVED TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
WHERE THEY DIED.

129
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
SIX OTHER ADULTS BEFORE

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
KILLING HIMSELF.

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
WE KNOW THAT WHEN POLICE

132
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
ARRIVED ON SCENE JUST AFTER

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
9:30 THIS MORNING, THEY DIDN'T

134
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
WASTE ANY TIME.

135
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
THEY WENT INSIDE THE SCHOOL,

136
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
LOCATING ADULTS AND CHILDREN

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
AND MOVING THEM OUT OF THE

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
SCHOOL TO SAFETY, THAT IS THEN

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
WHEN THEY FOUND THE VICTIMS

140
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000

SO AGAIN, HORRIFIC SET OF

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
CIRCUMSTANCES HERE.
WE NOW UNDERSTAND THAT THE

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
FATHER OF THE SHOOTER IS BEING

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
QUESTIONED IN NEW JERSEY BY

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
THE F.B.I.
THERE WERE EARLY REPORTS THAT

148
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
HE ALSO HAD BEEN KILLED.

149
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THAT IS NOT THE CASE.

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
THE FATHER OF ADAM LANZA IS

151
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000

157
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
THE SHOOTER ADAM MAY HAVE BEEN

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
CARRYING HIS BROTHER'S I.D.

159
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
WHICH LED TO EARLY CONFUSION

160
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
ABOUT WHO THE IDENTITY WAS.

161
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
HAPPENED WITH THE BACKGROUND

182
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000

183
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
FROM THE BEGINNING.

MINE TO ESTABLISH HOW SUCH A

295
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
SENSELESS TRAGEDY COULD HAPPEN

296
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
AGAIN IN UNITED STATES.

297
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000

298
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
ANYTHING CHANGED WITH SCHOOL

303
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
>> I THINK THE SCHOOL SECURITY

304
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000

305
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000

THEY ARE STILL INSIDE THAT

BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE

1118

CHILDREN, AND FOR THE FAMILIES

1119
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
OF THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST.

1120
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
>> Bret: AN EMOTIONAL

1121
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA, REACTING TO

1122
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
THE SCHOOL SHOOTING IN NEWTOWN

1123
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
CONNECTICUT.
FOR ANALYSIS GO TO WASHINGTON,

1124
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
D.C. AND PANEL.

1125
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
FRED BARNES OF "WEEKLY

1126
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
STANDARD."

1127
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
KIRSTEN POWERS FOR DAILY

1128
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
BEAST.

1129
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
SYNDICATED COLUMNIST CHARLES

1130
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
KRAUTHAMMER.

1131
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
CHARLES, WORDS TODAY?

1132
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
>> THE FIRST THING TO SAY IN

1133
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
LOOKING AT THIS OR ANALYZING

1134
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
THIS REQUIRES A HUGE AMOUNT OF

1135
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
HUMILITY.

1136
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
THE TRUE FACT IS WE DO NOT

1137
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
KNOW AND OFTEN EVEN AFTER

1138
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
THESE EVENTS ARE ANALYZEED AND

1139
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
THOUGHT THROUGH, WE REALLY

1140
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF EVIL.

1141
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
AND IT'S BEEN STRUGGLED WITH

1142
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
FOREVER.

1143
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE CURRENT

1144
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
SHOOTING IS THAT PEOPLE ARE

1145
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
DIVIDED IN THREE CAMPS.

1146
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
THREE ELEMENTS.

1147
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SHOOTER, YOU

1148
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
HAVE THE WEAPON, AND YOU'VE

1149
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
GOT THE CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT.

1150
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE WHICHEVER

1151
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
CAUSE THEY WANT TO BLAME.

1152
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
THEY WILL SAY IT'S GUNS THAT

1153
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
WERE AVAILABLE.

1154
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
LAWS OUGHT TO BE TIGHTENED,

1155
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
ALTHOUGH THE BRADY CAMPAIGN

1156
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
SAYS CONNECTICUT HAS THE FOUR

1157
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
STRICTEST LAWS IN THE COUNTRY.

1158
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
THEN YOU HAVE THE ENVIRONMENT.

1159
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT, TEND TO

1160
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
SAY THAT OUR CULTURE DECEN

1161
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
DECENTTIZING YOUNG --

1162
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
DE-SENSITIZING PEOPLE IN

1163
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
MOVIES AND VIDEO GAMES TO KILL

1164
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
IN WAY OLDER GENERATION FIND

1165
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
DISTURBING.
I TEND TO GRAVITATE TOWARD THE

1166
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
PSYCHOLOGY OF THE KILLER.

1167
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE

1168
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
DETAILS OF THE CRIME, HE BEGAN

1169
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
BY SHOOTING HIS MOTHER IN THE

1170
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
FACE.
TAKING HER WEAPON AND THEN

1171
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
DESTROYING EVERYTHING PRECIOUS

1172
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
TO HER.

1173
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
HER COLLEAGUES AND HER

1174
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
CHILDREN.
THEN KILLING HIMSELF.

1175
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
THAT I THINK IS WHERE I WOULD

1176
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
START.

1177
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
ALTHOUGH I THINK ALL THE

1178
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
ISSUES HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED.

1179
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
>> Bret: KIRSTEN?

1180
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
>> YES, I THINK ALL THE ISSUES

1181
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED BUT THE

1182
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
PSYCHOLOGY PART HAS TO BE

1183
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
PAIRED WITH THE SEMI-AUTOMATIC

1184
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
WEAPON IN ORDER FOR SOMETHING

1185
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN.

1186
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
AS THE PRESIDENT SAID TODAY WE

1187
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
NEED TO HAVE SOME MEANINGFUL

1188
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
ACTION, TO DEAL WITH THIS

1189
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
ISSUE.
THIS IS SOMETHING NOW THAT IS

1190
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
STARTING TO ALMOST BECOME

1191
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
EPIDEMIC IN OUR COUNTRY.

1192
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
IT'S NOT -- IN MY ENTIRE

1193
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
CHILDHOOD I DON'T -- YOU KNOW,

1194
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
IF IT HAPPENED, THIS WAS SUCH

1195
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
A RARITY.

1196
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
IT'S NOW ALMOST COMMONPLACE.

1197
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
THIS SHOOTINGS.

1198
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
THIS IS PARTICULARLY TERRIBLE

1199
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
BECAUSE IT INVOLVED ALL THE

1200
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
YOUNG CHILDREN.

1201
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
5-YEAR-OLD.
THE INNOCENT OF THE INNOCENT

1202
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
YOU CAN THINK OF.

1203
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

1204
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
THE FACTORS, MENTAL HEALTH

1205
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
FACTORS.

1206
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
ARE WE LOOKING FOR SIGNS, ARE

1207
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
WE OFFERING MENTAL HEALTH

1208
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
TREATMENT TO PEOPLE?

1209
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
BUT ALSO LOOKING AT THE GUN

1210
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
LAWS, DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT GUN

1211
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
LAWS?
ALL THE DIFFERENTS A SPENTS OF

1212
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
IT -- ASPECTS OF IT AND TRY TO

1213
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
SERIOUSLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE

1214
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
AND NOT JUST THROW UP OUR HAND

1215
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
AND SAY WELL, THERE IS NOTHING

1216
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

1217
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
THESE THINGS JUST HAPPEN.

1218
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
THESE THINGS JUST SHOULDN'T

1219
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
HAPPEN.

1220
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
>> Bret: FRED, ATTORNEY

1221
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
GENERAL HOLDER EARLIER TALKED

1222
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
ABOUT FREEDOMS AND AGE LOSING

1223
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY --

1224
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
ANALYZING WHAT HAPPENED TODAY

1225
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
IN CONTRAST OR CONTEXT OF OUR

1226
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
FREEDOMS.

1227
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
>> WELL, ONE OF THE FREEDOMS

1228
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
WE HAVE HAD IN THIS COUNTRY

1229
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
RATIFIED BY THE SUPREME COURT

1230
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

1231
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
INDIVIDUALS CAN DO IT AN THEY

1232
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
DO.

1233
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
BUT THERE ARE OTHER COUNTRIES

1234
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
WHERE ARMS ARE PLENTIFUL,

1235
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
COUNTRYS LIKE ISRAEL AND

1236
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
SWITZERLAND WE DON'T HAVE THE

1237
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
SAME HOMICIDE RATE WE HAVE IN

1238
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
THE UNITED STATES.

1239
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
WE DON'T HAVE THE MASS

1240
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
KILLINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

1241
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
MY ARE ACTION WAS OH, NOT

1242
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
AGAIN.
THAT WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE'S

1243
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
REACTION.
THE PROBLEM IS THE UNITED

1244
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
STATES IS ONE THAT CHARLES

1245
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
MENTIONED; THE PSYCHOLOGY OF

1246
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE

1247
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
KILLINGS, VIRGINIA TECH,

1248
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
COLUMBINE, THEATER IN AURORA,

1249
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
COLORADO AND ALL THE KILLINGS.

1250
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO KEEP

1251
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THESE

1252
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
PEOPLE.

1253
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
IT'S HARD TO DO.

1254
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
LOOK, THE GUNS BELONG TO THIS

1255
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
KILLER'S MOTHER.

1256
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
SHE HAD THEM AT THE HOME.

1257
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
THE SON NOT OLD ENOUGH TO OWN

1258
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
A FIREARM GOT THEM AND TOOK

1259
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
THEM AND USED THEM.

1260
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD

1261
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
REALLY STOP THAT.

1262
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
EVEN IN A STATE, AS CHARLES

1263
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
SAID, WITH PRETTY STRICT GUN

1264
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
CONTROL LAWS.

1265
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
THE PROBLEM IS WE DO HAVE --

1266
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES

1267
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
WITH A LOT OF GUN, A CULTURE

1268
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
OF VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY

1269
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
THAT ALLOWS, THAT ALLOWS A LOT

1270
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
OF VIOLENT ACTS TO HAPPEN.

1271
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
THEY WEREN'T CUS CURBED WELL HEE

1272
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
AND PEOPLE DO GET GUNS.

1273
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
LOOK, WE ARE NOT GOING TO BEEN N

1274
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY.

1275
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
WE CAN CURB THE NUMBER OF THEM

1276
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
BUT THESE WERE LEGALLY OWNED

1277
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
GUNS AND WERE USED BY

1278
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
PRESUMABLY, A PSYCHOTIC

1279
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
PERSON.

1280
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
HARD TO STOP THAT.

1281
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
>> Bret: CHARLES, IF YOU A

1282
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
PARENT TONIGHT PUT ON THE

1283
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
PSYCHIATRIST HAT AND YOUR

1284
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
CHILD, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO

1285
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
THEM?

1286
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
>> I MEAN WEFULLY A CULTURE

1287
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE FROM THE

1288
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
EVENTS.
WHICH CITIZEN TRAGIC.

1289
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
SO EVERYBODY IS EXPOSED.

1290
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
ALL YOU CAN DO IS PROVIDE THEM

1291
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
SAFETY AND LOVE.

1292
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
NO EXPLANATIONS THAT'S NOT

1293
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
WHAT YOU DO.

1294
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
SHOW THEM YOU WILL PROTECT

1295
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
THEM, BECAUSE YOU LOVE THEM.

1296
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
THEY DO NOT HAVE TO FEAR.

1297
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
THAT IS ALL YOU CAN SAY.

1323
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000

1324
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
HAD BEEN A SCHOOL SHOOTING,

1325
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000

00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
PEOPLE.
>> IT'S JUST THE WORST, MOST

1333
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
DEVASTATING STUFF.

1334
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000

I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE

1340
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
DOING THAT.

1341
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
>> IT IS VERY UPSETTING,

1342
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
CHILDREN, WHO HAVEN'T LIVED,

1343
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
HAVEN'T EXPERIENCEED ANYTHING.

1344
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000

MADE IT OUT ALIVE AND STILL

1352
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
MAY FACE YEARS OF TRAUMA FROM

1353
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
THE EVENT CUT TO THE CORE OF

1354
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
PARENTS EVERYWHERE.

1355
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
>> I CRIED AND I CRIED AND MY

1356
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
DAUGHTER CALLED ME WHO HAS A

1357
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000

SHE COULDN'T STOP CRYING.

1360
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
SO IT'S A TRAGEDY.

1361
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
AS I SAID TO HER, YOU CAN'T

1362
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
UNDERSTAND THINGS LIKE THAT.

1363
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
>> IT'S DEVASTATING.

1364
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
IT REALLY SHOOK ME.

1365
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
BECAUSE I HAVE, YOU KNOW, SON

1366
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
HERE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND

1367
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THE

1368
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
PARENTS GO THROUGH, THE
PARENTS GETTING THE COOLS.

1369
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
IT'S SO UNFORTUNATE.

1370
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
IT'S TRAGIC.

1371
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000

WE ARE TOGETHER.
WE'RE COHESIVE.

>> WE HAVE A SOCIETAL

1391
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
BREAKDOWN.
I'M A TEACHER, SO I SEE IT AT

1392
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
AN OPERATIONAL LEVEL.

1393
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO TAKE EASY

1394

ACCESS TO THINGS TO FILL A

1397
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000

THEN WALKING UP TO SCHOOL

1403
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000

WROTE HUG YOUR CHILDREN FOR ME

1412
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
THIS HAS PLUNGED THE WHOLE

1413
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
COUNTRY IN TO TERRIBLE

1414
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000

SOME FINAL THOUGHTS ON A

1417
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
TRAGIC DAY.

1418
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
There is no
mass-produced human.

1419
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
So we created the
extraordinarily

1420
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000

SHE ALSO LIKES TO RIDE
HER BIKE.

1433
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
SHE KNOWS THE POTENTIAL
FOR MAKING OR LOSING MONEY

00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
CAN POP UP ANYTIME.

1435
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
THAT'S WHY SHE TRADES WITH
THE LEADER IN MOBILE TRADING.

1436

SO SHE'S ALWAYS READY
TO TAKE ACTION,

NO MATTER HOW WILY...

1438
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
OR WEIRD...

1439
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
OR WONDERFULLY
THE MARKET'S BEHAVING...

1440
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
WHICH ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

1441
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.
