THERE IS LITTLE ANYONE CAN SAY

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
WHEN 20 SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
THAT KIND OF THING DIMINISHES

RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO KNOWN

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
MOTIVE AND WE WON'T BE GETTING

82
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
ANY EXPLANATION FROM LANZA WHO

83
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
COMMITTED SUICIDE AT THE SCHOOL.

84
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
THIS IS THE WORST SCHOOL

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
SHOOTING EVER IN CONNECTICUT.

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
SECOND WORST IN THE UNITED

87
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
STATES BEHIND VIRGINIA TECH.

88
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
HERE ARE SOME SCENES IN THE

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
AFTERMATH OF THIS APPALLING

90
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
CRIME.
>> EVIL VISITED THIS COMMUNITY

91
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
TODAY.

92
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000

93
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
>> A CALL CAME IN TO DISPATCH.

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
POLICE OFFICERS AND RESOURCES

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
FROM ALL OVER THE STATE RACED TO

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
THAT AREA AS THEY CONVERGED ON

97
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
THE SCHOOL.

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
THE CHILDREN OBVIOUSLY WERE VERY

99
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
SHAKEN.
THEY WERE CRYING IN THE CLOSET.

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
WHEN THEY WERE LEAVING, THE

101
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
POLICE MADE THEM HOLD HANDS AND

102
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
TOLD THEM TO CLOSE THEIR EYES.

103
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
>> THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

106
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

107
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
>> THE GYM TEACHERS DIRECTED US

108
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
TO STAY AGAINST THE WALL.

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
EVERYBODY STARTED KIND OF

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
PANICS.
>> THERE IS NO WORDS.

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
IT'S SHEAR TERROR.

112
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
>> DOESN'T EVEN SEEM REAL.
IT JUST DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT'S

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
EVEN POSSIBLE.

114
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
>> WE ALL HUDDLED AND I KEPT

115
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
HEARING THESE BOOMING NOISES.

116
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
>> I JUST SAW ALL THESE MOMS

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
NETWORKING, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

118
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
WHAT'S GOING ON.

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
>> THE KIDS WERE TERRIFIED!

120
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
THEY WERE TERRIFIED.

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THEY HAD JUST WITNESSED

122
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
SOMETHING AND THEY WERE

123
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
TERRIFIED.

124
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
>> MOST TRAUMATIZING THING I'VE

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
EVER BEEN TO.

126
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
>> MY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF

127
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THE VICTIMS AND IN THE WORDS OF

128
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
SCRIPTURE, HEAL THE BROKEN

129
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
HEARTED AND BIND UP THEIR

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
WOUNDS.
>> Bill: THREE GUNS WERE FOUND

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
AT THE SCENE.

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
TWO PISTOLS AND A RIFLE.

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
POLICE SAY THEY WERE LEGALLY

134
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
PURCHASED AND REGISTERED TO

135
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
LANZA'S MOTHER WHO AGAIN WAS

136
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
APPARENTLY MUMPEDDED BY HIM.

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
WITH US NOW, GERALDO RIVERA.

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
BETWEEN US, WE PRETTY MUCH SEEN

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
WHAT THERE IS TO SEE IN THIS

140
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
WORLD, BUT THIS KIND OF EVIL HAS

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
GOT TO BE AT THE TOP OF THE

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
CHART.

143
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
>> YOU KNOW, BILL, I'VE BEEN EYE

144
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
TO EYE WITH CHARLES MANSON.

145
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'VE BEEN A WAR CORRESPONDENT

146
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
FOR SEVEN YEARS, I COVERED THE

147
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
WORSE ATROCITIES OF IRAQ AND

148
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
AFGHANISTAN.
THIS IS THE WORST THING EVER.

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I HAVE A SCENE IN MY MIND THAT I

150
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
JUST CAN'T GET OUT OF MY MIND.

151
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
HE HAD THE THREE WEAPONS.

152
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
HE HAD THE GLOCK AND THE SIX

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
HOUR, BOTH .9 MILLIMETER, THE

154
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
223 BUSH MASTER.

155
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT HE

156
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
USED IT.

157
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
MOST REPORTS ARE SUGGESTING HE

158
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
LEFT THAT ONE IN THE CAR, WHICH

159
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
MEANS HE WENT INTO THE SCHOOL,

160
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
GETS PAST SECURITY, GETS INTO

161
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THE CLASSROOM, ONE OR TWO

162
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
CLASSROOMS AND STARTS FIRING AT

163
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
THE LITTLE CHILDREN.

164
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
AT SOME POINT HE HAS TO RUN OUT

165
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
OF AMMUNITION.

166
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
EVEN IF HE HAS EXTENDED

167
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
MAGAZINES, AT SOME POINT HE HAS

168
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
TO RELOAD.

169
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
SO THE SCENE I HAVE IN MY MIND

170
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
IS THESE BABIES, BETWEEN THE

171
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
AGES OF FIVE AND TEN, AS THIS

172
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
GROWNUP -- THESE ARE CHILDREN

173
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN EVIL.

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO ARE IN

175
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
THE FLOWER OF INNOCENCE.

176
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
HERE IS A GROWNUP DRESSED IN

177
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
CAMO AND BULLET PROOF VEST AND

178
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
HE'S GOT TWO HAND GUNS AND HE

179
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
STARTS KILLING THE CHILDREN AND

180
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE CHILDREN

181
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
SCREAMING AND THEN HE'S

182
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
RELOADING AND THERE IS THE DEAD

183
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
CHILDREN AND THERE IS THE

184
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
CHILDREN YET TO BE KILLED.

185
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
IN THIS MOMENT, JUST IMAGINE THE

186
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
RIGHT?
>> THEY WERE SUPPOSEDLY IN

553
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
KINDERGARTEN.

554
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
WE HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD ANY OF THE

555
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
CHILDREN'S NAMES.
SO I DON'T KNOW.

556
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I DO KNOW THAT MY FRIENDS THAT

557
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'VE TALKED TO, THEIR CHILDREN

558
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
ARE SAFE.

559
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I MADE SURE OF THAT.

560
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
ANYBODY I SAW IN THE FIRE HOUSE,

561
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I HUGGED THEM.

562
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
AND I SAID DO YOU HAVE YOUR

563
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
BABIES?

564
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
AND THEY SAID YES, WE'RE OKAY.

565
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
IT WASN'T UNTIL LATER WHEN -- GO

566
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000

>> Bill: SANDY HOOK IS A VERY,

567
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
VERY CALM PLACE, NEWTOWN,

568
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
CONNECTICUT, A BEAUTIFUL SUBURB.

569
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
>> OH, YEAH.

570
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000

571
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000

>> SAFE.

572
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
PLACE ON EARTH YOU WOULD THINK

573
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
AT THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

574
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU HEARD

575
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
ABOUT THIS AND WHAT WAS YOUR

576
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
REACTION?

577
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
>> OKAY.

578
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I WAS HOME DOING MY CHRISTMAS

579
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
CARDS ON-LINE AND I RECEIVED A

580
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
PHONE CALL FROM THE SCHOOL

581
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
SUPERINTENDENT THAT WE USUALLY

582
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
GET IF THERE IS GOING TO BE AN

583
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
EARLY DISMISSAL, YOU KNOW,

584
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
SOMETHING OF THAT SORT, SAYING

585
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
THAT THERE WAS A SHOOTING IN

586
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
NEWTOWN AND THAT THE SCHOOLS

587
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
WERE ON LOCKDOWN.

588
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
BUT SHE DID NOT SAY THAT THERE

589
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
WAS A SHOOTING AT ONE OF THE

590
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
SCHOOLS.
SO I WASN'T THAT CONCERNED UNTIL

591
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I RECEIVED A TEXT FROM -- I

592
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
THINK IT WAS A.P. NEWS ON MY

593
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
PHONE SAYING THAT THERE WAS A

594
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
SHOOTING IN THE SANDY HOOK

595
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
SCHOOL ON DICKINSON.

596
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
THAT'S WHERE MY DAUGHTER

597
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
ATTENDS, SO I JUMPED IN THE CAR.

598
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I WENT TO THE SCHOOL.

599
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
THERE WAS ALREADY PARENTS THERE

600
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
CRYING AND I SAW A FRIEND OF

601
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
MINE.
I SAID WHAT HAPPENED?

602
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
AND THEY WERE HYSTERICAL THAT

603
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
THEY CARRIED OUT A LITTLE GIRL

604
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
AND SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS

605
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
DEAD.
I PANICKED.

606
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
BUT LUCKILY I SAW MY DAUGHTER

607
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
RIGHT AWAY COMING WITH HER

608
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
TEACHER, 'CAUSE THEY STARTED

609
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
WALKING THE KIDS FROM THE SCHOOL

610
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
TO THE FIRE HOUSE, WHICH IS

611
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
ALMOST ADJACENT TO THE SCHOOL.

612
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
>> Bill: BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THE

613
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
SCHOOL HANDLED THE SITUATION

614
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
WELL AND THE POLICE AND THE

615
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
AUTHORITIES DID A GOOD JOB.

616
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
IS THAT WHAT YOU SAW?

617
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
>> YES.

618
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
ABSOLUTELY.

619
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
>> Bill: SO EVERYBODY WAS

620
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
REASSURED QUICKLY?

621
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
YOU SAY YOU PANICKED, BUT

622
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
EVERYTHING WAS CONTAINED.

623
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
>> THE CHILDREN WERE BEING

624
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
ORDERLY, TAKEN TO THE FIRE

625
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
HOUSE.
THEY WENT INTO A LARGE ROOM.

626
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
THERE WAS A LOT OF CRYING.

627
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
BUT THE TEACHERS SEEM TO KEEP

628
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
THE KIDS CALM AND WE KEPT EVERY

629
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
CLASSROOM WAS KEPT TOGETHER, SO

630
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
THE TEACHER KNEW WHERE HER KIDS

631
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
WERE.

632
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
AS THE PARENTS CAME IN, YOU

633
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
KNOW, SHE'S OVER HERE, YOU KNOW.

634
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
SHE'S OKAY.

635
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
WE HAD NO IDEA THE GRAVITY OF

636
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
THE SITUATION UNTIL LATER ON

637
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
WHEN I CAME HOME AND I HEARD THE

638
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
NEWS.
I HEARD THAT THE PRINCIPAL WAS

639
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
SHOT AND THE LITTLE GIRL THAT I

640
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
WAS TOLD THAT WAS TAKEN OUT

641
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
BLOODY.
BUT WE HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE

642
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
WOULD BE 20 SOME ODD PEOPLE

643
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
KILLED.
>> Bill: DID YOU KNOW THIS

644
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
TEACHER WHOSE SON DID THIS

645
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
ALLEGEDLY AND WOUND UP DEAD?

646
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
DID YOU KNOW HER?

647
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
>> I NEVER HEARD HER NAME

648
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
BEFORE.
I HAVE OLDER CHILDREN.

649
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
THEY DON'T KNOW THE BOYS.

650
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
SHE'S NOT LISTED ON THE

651
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
DIRECTORY IN SCHOOL AS A

652
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER.

653
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I DO KNOW THAT THEY STARTED A

654
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
PRESCHOOL HERE THIS YEAR.

655
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
SO I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WAS A

656
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
PRESCHOOL TEACHER.

657
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
>> Bill: BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HER.

658
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
OKAY.

659
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
>> NO.
>> Bill: ALL RIGHT.

660
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
SOPHIA, WE APPRECIATE YOU

661
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000

663
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
LABINSKI, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000

665
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

666
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH

667
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
THIS.
>> THANK YOU.

668
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
>> Bill: PLENTY MORE AS "THE

669
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000

670
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
EVENING.

671
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
EVIL PEOPLE, CAN WE PROTECT

672
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000

673
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
WE'LL TALK WITH TWO MENTAL

675

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
HAMMER STILL IN A MEXICAN

677

678
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
WE'RE TRYING HARD TO GET HIM

679
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
OUT.
WE HAVE HOPE YOU STAY TUNED FOR

680
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
THOSE REPORTS

681
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Mmmm tasty.

682
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And cut! Very good.

683
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

684
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

685
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

686
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It's not real.

687
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

688
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

689
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

690
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

691
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
YOU WON'T TAKE OUR FUTURE.

A COUPLE BIG THINGS, BILL, ONE

00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
IS WE CAN RETHINK OUR

THAT THAT PERSON MAY HARM.

728
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
AND SECONDLY, WE CAN GET BACK TO

729
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
BEING THE KIND OF A CULTURE IN

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
THINKING ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF

736
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
THEIR ACTIONS ON OTHERS BECAUSE

737
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
WE'VE BECOME COARSENED AND

738
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
CALLUS TO THE POINT THAT A KID

739
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
CAN GROW UP IN THIS SOCIETY AND

740
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
NOT NECESSARILY INTERNALIZE THE

741
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
KIND OF DISGUST THAT YOU AND I

742
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
FEEL, THIS VISCERAL DISGUST FOR

743
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
THE KIND OF DISREGARD FOR HUMAN

744
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
LIFE THAT WE SAW TODAY.

745
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
>> Bill: DR. RUSKIN, IT SEEMS TO

746
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
ME THAT THERE IS CASUAL VIOLENCE

747
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
AND VERY EXPLICIT VIOLENCE ON

748
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
DISPLAY MORE THAN EVER BEFORE
AND THAT'S, OF COURSE, THANKS TO

749
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
THE INTERNET.

750
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THIS IS

751
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
HAVING AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE

752
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
ON A GENERATION OF AMERICANS.

753
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
IT'S HARD TO QUANTIFY THAT.

754
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
BUT CERTAINLY THE CASUAL

755
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
VIOLENCE IS ON DISPLAY FAR MORE

756
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
THAN ANY OTHER TIME IN HISTORY.

757
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
AM I WRONG?

758
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
>> I WOULDN'T YOU ARE NOT WRONG.

759
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
AND WE CAN'T IGNORE THE FACT

760
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
THAT OUR ENVIRONMENT ABSOLUTELY

761
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
AFFECTS US.

762
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
WE MUST VIEW THINGS

763
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
SYSTEMICALLY.

764
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
WE ARE A SYSTEM L IT'S

765
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
TELEVISION, WHETHER IT'S PARENTS

766
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
BEING TOO BUSY TO SPEND QUALITY

767
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
TIME WITH THEIR KIDS, WHETHER A

768
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
KID IS HURTING AND ANOTHER CHILD

769
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
IS MEAN ABOUT THAT, WHETHER

770
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
TEACHERS ARE NOT NOTICING,

771
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
WHETHER PARENTS ARE NOT NOTICING

772
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE

773
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING OF THEIR

774
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
KIDS.
EVERYTHING AFFECTS EVERYTHING.

775
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
THE VIOLENCE THAT WE'RE

776
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
EXPERIENCING IS SYSTEMIC AND WE

777
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
NEED TO PUT A STOP TO IT BY

778
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
EVERYBODY PLAYING A ROLE,

779
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
PARENTS, VERY IMPORTANT.

780
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE IT ALL

781
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
STARTS, AT A YOUNG AGE.

782
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
>> Bill: ALL RIGHT.

783
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
SO BUT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO

784
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
LEGISLATE GOOD PARENTING,

785
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
DR. RUSSELL.
THAT'S A PROBLEM ON ALMOST EVERY

786
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
SOCIOLEVEL THAT WE HAVE IN

787
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
AMERICA.
I MEAN, FAMILIES FALL APART.

788
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
FATHERS ABANDON CHILDREN,

789
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
MOTHERS ABUSE CHILDREN, WHATEVER

790
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
IT MAY BE, THEN THE CHILDREN

791
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
SUFFER.
SO IN A FREE SOCIETY, YOU'RE

792
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE

793
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
DYSFUNCTIONAL PEOPLE AND YOU'RE

794
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE EVIL.

795
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
ALWAYS.
I DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE

796
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
UNDERSTAND

797
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
EXAMPLE, DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

798
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
EVIL.

799
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
WHEN I WOULD TELL HER, HEY, MOM,

800
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I WAS IN EL SALVADOR AND I SAW

801
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
NUNS GET SHOT IN THE BACK OF THE

802
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
HEAD, SHE ALMOST COULDN'T

803
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
PROCESS IT.

804
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
SHE COULDN'T PROCESS IT.

805
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
YOU KNOW.

806
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE

807
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
AMERICANS REALLY UNDERSTAND THE

808
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
CONCEPT OF EVIL.

809
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT

810
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
IT EXISTS.

811
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
IT AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE

812
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
ABSOLUTELY ARE PEOPLE, THEY MAY

813
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
NOT BE MENTALLY HEALTHY, THEY'RE

814
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
SANE AND THEY CHOOSE TO HURT

815
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
OTHERS JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO

816
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
AND WE HAVE TO WRAP OUR MINDS

817
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
AROUND THAT AND YOU'RE RIGHT, WE

818
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
CAN'T MAKE EVERYBODY PARENT THE

819
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
WAY THAT THEY SHOULD.

820
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
SOCIETY IS NOT SQUANDER CHANCES

821
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
WHEN WE GET THEM TO INTERVENE

822
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
BECAUSE THE PERSON HAS GIVEN US

823
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
REASON TO, HAS SHOWN A

824
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
PROPENSITY TO BE DANGEROUS.

825
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I PREDICTED IN THIS THING, WE'RE

826
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
GOING TO FIND OUT THERE WERE

827
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
SIGNS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

828
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
>> Bill: THERE USUALLY ARE.

829
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
THERE ARE USUALLY SIGNS.

830
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
ALTHOUGH A TED BUNDY, THE SERIAL

831
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
KILLER, TRACKED THAT GUY ALL

832
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
OVER THE UNITED STATES,

833
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
NOBODY -- I TALKED TO HIS

834
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
MOTHER.
NOBODY THOUGHT THAT HE WAS A

835
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
MONSTER WHO WOULD LOOK A WOMAN

836
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
IN THE EYE AND THEN CUT HER

837
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
THROAT BECAUSE HE CAME ACROSS AS

838
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
THIS PREPPY, REGULAR GUY.

839
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
BUT SOCIOPATHS AND NARE CITY

840
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
CYSTS, I THINK THIS IS GROWING

841
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
IN OUR SOCIETY.

842
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I THINK THAT THIS DISEASE, THIS

843
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
MENTAL ILLNESS OF SOCIOPATHY IS

844
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
GROWING AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

845
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
>> YOU KNOW, THERE IS A

846
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

847
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
PSYCHOPATH AND THE SOCIOPATH.

848
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
THE PSYCHOPATH, THEY DON'T CARE

849
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
EVEN IF IT'S THEIR FAMILY THAT

850
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
THEY'RE HURTING.

851
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
THERE IS NO REMORSE.

852
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
THERE IS NO GUILT.

853
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
WHEREAS A SOCIOPATH MAY OR MAY

854
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
NOT FEEL GUILTY OVER HURT AGO

855
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
FAMILY MEMBER, BUT THEY SURE AS

856
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
HECK DON'T FEEL GUILTY ABOUT

857
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
HURTING SOMEBODY ELSE.

858
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
AND THE PSYCHOPATH CAN APPEAR

859
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
VERY LOVELY TO OTHERS, WHEREAS

860
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
THIS SOCIOPATH OFTEN YOU CAN

861
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
TELL THAT THERE IS A

862
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
DISTURBANCE, AND I BELIEVE THAT

863
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
IN OUR CULTURE, AS WE HAVE

864
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
BECOME SO SELF-ABSORBED AND

865
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
SELF-TITLED THAT WE DESERVE TO

866
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
HAVE LOVING PARENTS, I DESERVE

867
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
NOT TO FEEL HURT, I DESERVE TO

868
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
HAVE MONEY.

869
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I DESERVE HAVE A JOB.

870
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
YES, YES.

871
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
EVERYBODY DESERVES.

872
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
BUT THE FACT IS, WE CAN NOT

873
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
CONTROL THE CARDS THAT ARE DEALT

874
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
TO US.

875
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
SO RATHER WE MUST WORK HARD

876
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
EVERY DAY IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH

877
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
AND WELLNESS AND WELL-BEING AND

878
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
IF WE'RE NOT FEELING WELL, WE,

879
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
WE, WE, I MUST TAKE OWNERSHIP OF

880
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
MY OWN BEHAVIOR AND SEEK OUT

881
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
HELP.

882
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
>> Bill: THAT'S A MATURE MIND.

883
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
YOUR POINT ABOUT WE ALL FEEL WE

884
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
DESERVE ALL THIS AND IF WE DON'T

885
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
GET IT, SOME OF US GO INTO A

886
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
RAGE AND SOME OF US LOSE IT AND

887
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
START TO INFLICT DAMAGE I THINK

888
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
A GOOD ONE.

889
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
BUT ONLY A MATURE MIND WILL SAY,

890
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I NEED HELP.

891
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
DOCTOR, I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU

892
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
THE LAST WORD IN KANSAS CITY.

893
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
PEOPLE WATCHING TONIGHT, THERE
IS NO SOLUTION TO EVIL.

894
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
WE JUST HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IT, I

895
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
THINK.
>> TWO THINGS.

896
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
DON'T CALL IT AN ILLNESS BECAUSE

897
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
THIS, WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

898
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
TONIGHT TRANSCENDS PSYCHOLOGY.

899
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
EVERYBODY WATCHING TONIGHT HAS

900
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
TO DECIDE WHAT TO CALL IT.

901
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I CALL IT EVIL.
YOU CALL IT EVIL.

902
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
THE OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND,

903
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
YOU DO A LOT ON THE CULTURE WAR.

904
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE CULTURE

905
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
THAT'S DRIFTING IN A DIRECTION,

906
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
YOU'RE BOUND TO HAVE THOSE

907
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE ON THE

908
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
FRINGES OF IT ANYWAY DRIFTING

909
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
EVEN FARTHER OUT OF THE BOUNDS.

910
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
>> Bill: ALLALL RIGHT.

911
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
THANKS VERY MUCH.
WHEN WE COME BACK, FORMER MARINE

912
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
UNJUSTLY IMPRISONED IN MEXICO.

913
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
WILL THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BE

914
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
ABLE TO GET HIM OUT OF JAIL?

915
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
WE'LL HAVE THE VERY LATEST ON A

916
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
VERY TROUBLING STORY.

917
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000

BECAUSE THEY HAD TO MOVE HIM

1073

1074
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000

1078
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
THIS?
I MEAN, HE DOESN'T HAVE THE

1079

1080
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000

1081
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000

1082
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
BUT DOES HE JUSTIFY THIS TRAVIS

1083
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
SEE?
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT

1084
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000

THIS OFFICIAL OR THE OTHER

1086

I CAN TELL YOU THIS, BILL, THE

1087
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IS PROBABLY

1088
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
EVEN GOING TO BE POWERLESS

1089
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT

1090
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
THEY'RE UNDER SIEGE BY THESE

1091
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000

1093
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000

TERRIBLE PRISON IS NOT THE

1095
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000

00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
CONGRESSWOMAN, THE PRESIDENT OF

1098
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
MEXICO DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH

1099
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
POWER TO RELEASE HAD AMERICAN

1100
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
FROM THAT FILTHY PRISON IN

1101
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
MATAMOROS?

1102
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME?

1103
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
>> I BELIEVE HE DOESN'T HAVE THE

1104
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
GUTS O DO IT.

1105
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
DOES HE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO

1106
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
IT?
YES.
>> Bill: OF COURSE HE DOES.

1107
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
>> THIS IS A CASE THAT WILL PUT

1108
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
HIM TO THE TEST.

1109
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
THIS IS A COUNTRY WHOSE LEADERS,

1110
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
LEADER AFTER LEADER, THEY LOVE

1111
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
TO LECTURE THE UNITED STATES

1112
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
ABOUT HOW BADLY WE SUPPOSEDLY

1113
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
TREAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

1114
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
HOGWASH.
HERE IS ANOTHER CASE, BECAUSE IT

1115
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
IS NOT AN ISOLATED CASE -- OF AN

1116
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
AMERICAN UNJUSTIFIABLY

1117
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
IMPRISONED.

1118
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
SO WE CALL ON THIS PRESIDENT TO

1119
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
DO HIS DUTY AND RELEASE THIS --

1120
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
>> Bill: I WANT OUR PRESIDENT TO

1121
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
DO SOMETHING, TOO.

1122
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I WANT BARAK OBAMA TO SPEAK OUT

1123
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
ABOUT THIS.

1124
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
HE HAS REMAINED SILENT.

1125
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
SO HAS SECRETARY OF STATE

1126
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
CLINTON.
I UNDERSTAND THIS MUCH AND I

1127
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
THINK YOU HINTED AT IT.

1128
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
WE DON'T WANT TO MUCK UP ANY

1129
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
NEGOTIATIONS THAT MIGHT BE

1130
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
FRUITFUL BY ATTACKING ANYBODY

1131
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
AND CALLING ANYBODY OUT MAKING

1132
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
ANY THREATS.

1133
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
THAT INCLUDES PRESIDENT OBAMA

1134
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
AND SECRETARY OF STATE CLINTON.

1135
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
WE'RE GOING TO ASSUME, YOU AND

1136
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
TELL ME IF I'M WRONG, THAT THE

1137
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS DOING

1138
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
WHAT THEY SHOULD.

1139
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I'M SOAPING THEY ARE DOING WHAT

1140
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
THEY SHOULD DO.

1141
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
IS THAT RIGHT?

1142
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
>> I DON'T GET THAT FEELING YET,

1143
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
BILL.

1144
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
MAYBE I'LL GET THAT FEELING --

1145
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
>> Bill: SO YOU WANT MORE

1146
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
PRESSURE PUT ON BY SECRETARY

1147
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
CLINTON AND PRESIDENT OBAMA?

1148
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
DO YOU WANT MORE PRESSURE?

1149
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THAT'S WHY I'VE REACHED OUT TO

1150
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
MY CONGRESSIONAL COLLEAGUES,

1151
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
OVER 50 OF THEM HAVE SIGNED A

1152
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
BIPARTISAN LETTER TO HILLARY

1153
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
CLINTON AND JANET NAPOLITANO,

>> Bill: THEY NEED TO GET OUT IN

1158
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000

THIS EVENING AND HE SHOULD HAVE,

1163
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000

CONGRESSWOMAN.
WE GOT TO GET THIS GUY OUT

1169

BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

1170
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
>> YOU ARE HIS LIFE POLICY.

1171
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I BELIEVE THAT --

1172
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000

1173
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000

00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000

BOYCOTT OF TRAVEL TO MEXICO IF

HE'S NOT OUT.

1177
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
SIMPLE AS THAT.

1178
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000

FOX NEWS ANCHOR BILL HEMMER IS

1205
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
ALL RIGHT, HEMMER.
WE'RE STARTING TO NOW LEARN A

1206
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

1207
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
INSIDE BY THE SCENE THAT THE

1208
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000

TELL US ABOUT THAT.

1210
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
>> IT IS A SCENE THAT CAN ONLY

1211
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
BE DESCRIBED AS GRISLY AND A

1212
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
SCENE THAT EVEN HARDENED POLICE

1213
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
OFFICERS WORKING THE STATE FOR

1214
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
DECADES HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE

1215
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
IN THEIR LIVES.

1216
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
BILL, WE BELIEVE ALL THE BODIES

1217
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
ARE STILL INSIDE THAT SMALL

1218
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
LITTLE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DOWN

1219
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
THE HILL FROM WHERE WE ARE AND

1220
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
THEY WILL NOT BE MOVED TONIGHT

1221
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
OR EVEN POSSIBLY TOMORROW OR

1222
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
EVEN INTO SUNDAY.

1223
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
THIS IS A GRISLY CRIME SCENE AND

1224
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
THE POLICE ARE BEING VERY

1225
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
PARTICULAR ABOUT MAKING SURE

1226
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
THAT THEY ARE CAREFUL ABOUT THIS

1227
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
EVIDENCE.
THIS IS A SCHOOL, BILL.

1228
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
IT'S A TINY PLACE.

1229
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FOURTH
GRATE.

1230
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
AND YOU COME UP HERE TO THIS

1231
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
TOWN AND YOU THINK THIS IS THE

1232
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
KIND OF COMMUNITY WITH YOU WANT

YOU GO DOWN THIS HILL THROUGH

1235
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
THE FOREST AND THE SCHOOL

1236
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
EMERGES THERE, BILL.

1237
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
THERE IS A SHORT LITTLE DRIVEWAY

1238
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
RUNS ABOUT 75 YARDS LEADING UP

1239
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
TO THE PARKING LOT OF THE

1240
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
SCHOOL.
YOU WALK IN THERE AND YOU THINK,

1241
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
WHAT IN THE WORLD COULD POSSIBLY

1242
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
GO WRONG HERE?

1243
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
AND TODAY EVERYTHING WENT WRONG.

1244
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
OVERNIGHT TONIGHT, THESE POLICE

1245
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
OFFICERS AND THESE INVESTIGATORS

1246
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
ARE WORKING THIS CRIME SCENE TO

1247
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
MAKE SURE THEY GET POSITIVE

1248
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
IDENTIFICATION, SOMETHING THAT

1249
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
WE EXPECT AT 8:00 A.M. TOMORROW

1250
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
EASTERN TIME TO BE ANNOUNCED TO

1251
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.

1252
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
>> Bill: OKAY.
WE HAVE AN IDENTIFICATION, THE

00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
PRINCIPAL WHO WAS SHOT DEAD BY

1254

00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
NAME OUT OF RESPECT TO THE

1256
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000

1257
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
HAVE NOT GIVEN OUT HER NAME YET.

1258
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
SHE'S 47 YEARS OLD.

1259
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000

YEARS, GOING BACK TO 2010.

1261
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
WHICH BY THE WAY, WAS THE LAST

1262
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
YEAR A SERIOUS CRIME WAS EVEN

1263
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
REPORTED IN THE TOWN OF NEWTOWN,

1264
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000

IN THIS SCHOOL DISTRICT.

1270
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
HERE IS THE SAD AWFUL THING

1271
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
ABOUT THIS, BILL.

1272
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
WE'RE JUST GETTING INTO THE

1273
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
HORROR OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

1274
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
EVERY HOUR, THESE LAYERS PEEL

1275
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000

00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
WE'RE GOING TO MEET THESE

1277
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
VICTIMS IN A VERY INTIMATE WAY

1278
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
OVERT COMING DAYS AS WE MOVE

1279
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
THROUGH THE FUNERALS AND IT'S

1280
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
ONLY GOING TO MAKE US MORE AND

1281
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
MORE SAD AS WE WORK THROUGH IT

1282
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
BECAUSE THESE LIVES HAVE BEEN

1283
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
LOST AND WHEN WE LEARN ABOUT

1284
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
PEOPLE LIKE IT WOMAN WHO WAS A

1285
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
MOTHER OF FIVE AND BASED ON THE

1286
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
POLICE ACCOUNTS WE HAVE, THE

1287
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
GUNMAN WALKED IN THE PRINCIPAL'S

1288
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
OFFICE FIRST AND COUNTED AT

1289
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
LEAST FOUR ADULTS, ALL OF WHICH

1290
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
WE BELIEVE, ALL OF WHOM WE

1291
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
BELIEVE WERE WOMEN, INCLUDING

1292
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
THE PRINCIPAL, AND SHOT THEM

1293
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
DEAD ON SITE AT THAT MOMENT.

1294
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
>> Bill: IT'S HARD TO COMPREHEND

1295
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
ANY OF THIS, OF COURSE.

1296
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
BUT I THINK PEOPLE HAVE TO

1297
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN THE

1298
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
SURVIVORS AND THERE WERE OVER

1299
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
600 KIDS IN THE SCHOOL.

1300
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I MEAN, IT'S A SMALL SCHOOL, BUT

1301
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
THERE ARE A LOFT KIDS THERE.

1302
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
ALL OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE

1303
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
AFFECTED FOR THE REST OF THEIR

1304
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
LIVES.

1305
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
YOU DON'T KNOW -- YOU DON'T KNOW

1306
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
HOW PERSONALITIES ABSORB THAT.

1307
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
SO NOT ONLY ARE THE DEAD AND

1308
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
GRIEVING FAMILIES WITH THEIR

1309
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
PRIORITY NUMBER ONE, BUT ALL OF

1310
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
THE OTHER CHILDREN, WE JUST

1311
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
TALKED TO ONE EARLIER IN THE

1312
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
PROGRAM, WHO LOOKED -- I DON'T

1313
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
KNOW WHETHER YOU SAW THAT, BUT

1314
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
SHE LOOKED LIKE, YOU KNOW, I'M

1315
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
EIGHT YEARS OLD AND WHAT AM I

1316
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
DEALG WITH HERE?

1317
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
NEVER GOES AWAY.

1318
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
IT NEVER GOES AWAY.

1319
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
SO THE COMMUNITY IS GOING TO

1320
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
HAVE TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR

1321
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
THOSE PEOPLE AND AS YOU SAID,

1322
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
IT'S GOING TO UNFOLD AND NOW WE

1323
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
HAVE A WOMAN WITH FIVE CHILDREN

1324
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT

1325
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
OF THOSE STORIES.

1326
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
>> YEAH.
ONE THING TO ADD ON THAT, I MET

1327
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
IN A YOUNG GIRL BEFORE SHE

1328
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
TALKED TO YOU, SOPHIA.

1329
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
SHE WAS SO CHARMING.

1330
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
SHE HAD A HUGE SMILE ON HER

1331
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
FACE.
I MEAN, YOU LOOK IN HER PARENTS'

1332
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
EYES AND YOU CAN SEE THE TEARS

1333
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
IN THEIR EYES AND THEY TRY AND

1334
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
FIGHT IT BACK.

1335
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
THEY HAVE THEIR DAUGHTER FOR

1336
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
CHRISTMAS AND SO MANY OTHERS DO

1337
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
NOT.
AND I SPOKE WITH A WOMAN EARLIER

1338
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
TODAY, SHE HAS A DAUGHTER NAMED

1339
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
ALEXIS.
SHE WAS A THIRD GRADER HERE,

1340
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
SHE'S OKAY, TOO.

1341
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
SHE SAID THROUGHOUT THE DAY,

1342
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
THEY'VE BEEN TALKING, SHE'S BEEN

1343
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
ASKING HER QUESTIONS.

1344
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
THEN FINALLY HER DAUGHTER, FROM

1345
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
THE THIRD GRADE, AGE EIGHT,

1346
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
SAID, MOM, ARE YOU GOING TO BE

1347
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
OKAY?

1348
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN ABOUT

1349
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
HOW THEY ABSORB THIS AND HOW

1350
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
THEY TRY AND INTERPRET IT AND

1351
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
UNDERSTAND IT.

1352
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
AND THEY, JUST LIKE IT WHOLE

1353
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000

1354
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000

THEIR CHILDREN AND THEY HAVE TO

1360
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
BE VERY WELL AWARE THAT THIS

1361
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
