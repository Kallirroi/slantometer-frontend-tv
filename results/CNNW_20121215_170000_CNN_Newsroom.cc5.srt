WE'RE TOLD TO BE STANDING BY.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
ALL OF THE BODIES HAVE BEEN

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
TO THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
HERE'S HOW THEY ARE TRYING TO

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
DEAL WITH WHAT'S GOING ON.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
INVESTIGATORS SAY -- THEY SPOKE

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
THAT PROBABLY WILL NOT BE
COMPLETED FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
DAY TO A DAY AND A HALF.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'M PUTTING A TIMELINE ON IT AND

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
IT COULD TAKE LONGER.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
EVERYTHING WE NEED TO DO TO

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
LITERALLY PEAL BACK THE ONION

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
THAT DOES NOT EXCLUDE THE

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
IT'S ALSO PART OF THE CRIME

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
SCENE, EVERY VEHICLE IN THAT

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
LOT.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
IT'S GOING TO BE A PAINSTAKING

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
PROCESS.
ONCE WE HAVE A TENTATIVE

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000

ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE HAD TO BE

INTERVIEWED AND ALL OF THOSE

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
AREAS HAD TO BE EXAMINED, HENCE

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
THAT CAUSED THE SECONDARY CRIME

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
SCENE WHICH WAS A SOLE FEMALE

POLICE HAVE DESCRIBED WHAT THEY

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
NOT RELEASING THAT INFORMATION,

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
AT LEAST NOT YET.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WHO WERE INSIDE

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000

THIS TRAGEDY.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
>> SHE WASN'T IN HER OFFICE.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
SHE WAS IN A MEETING.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
HE WENT THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR,

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
IF YOU GO IN THE FRONT DOOR THE

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
OFFICE IS IN FRONT OF YOU.
HE WENT BY THE FIRST-CLASS ROOM

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
WHERE THE SHOOTINGS TOOK PLACE.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
SHE WAS IN A MEETING, I HEARD,

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
ACROSS THE HALLWAY AND SHE MUST

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
HAVE COME OUT AND CONFRONTED HIM

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
ON HIS WAY DOWN THE HALLWAY.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST, MARY

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
SHERLACH WAS KILLED.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
>> WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
THE REACTION OF SOME OF THE

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
TEACHERS AND PROTECTING THEIR

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
CHILDREN?
>> I THINK EVERYBODY DOES WHAT

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
THEY HAVE TO DO WHEN THEY ARE

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
CONFRONTED WITH A SITUATION LIKE

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
THAT AND EVERYBODY -- YOU KNOW,

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
WE PRACTICE IT AND THEY KNEW

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
WHAT TO DO AND YOU JUST -- YOU

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
THINK ABOUT PROTECTING THE KIDS

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
AND JUST DOING THE RIGHT THING.

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
>> HOW HAVE YOU PRACTICED THIS?

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
>> WE HAVE LOCKDOWN DRILLS.

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MANY BUT

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
AMOUNT EVACUATION DRILLS AND

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
LOCKDOWN DRILLS.

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
SO THE KIDS KNOW THE ROUTINE AND

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
EVERYONE HAS A SPOT IN THE ROOM

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THAT THEY ARE TO GO TO.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
>> CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT SPOT?

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
>> IN THE LIBRARY IT'S A

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
BOOKCASE UP AGAINST THE WALL.

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
WE HAD TO MOVE OUT OF THE SPOT

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
BECAUSE ONE OF OUR DOORS WAS NOT

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
LOCKED.
WE WENT INTO THE BACK STORAGE

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
ROOM.
>> HOW CLOSE WERE YOU?

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
>> WE WERE THIS CLOSE TOGETHER.

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
THERE WAS CRAYONS AND PAPER IN

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
THE STORAGE ROOM IN THE BACK AND

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
WE TORE SOME UP AND GAVE THEM

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
CLIP BOARDS AND HAD THEM COLOR.

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
>> WHO WAS WITH YOU?

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
WERE YOU ALONE?

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
>> THERE WERE THREE AIDES WITH

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
US.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
>> YOU DIDN'T KNOW AT THAT

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
POINT?

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
>> WE KNEW BECAUSE I CALLED THE
OFFICE AND SHE TOLD ME THERE WAS

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
A SHOOTER.
>> A LOT TO LEARN.

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
ABOUT A MEETING TAKING PLACE

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
BETWEEN SOME OF THE

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
ADMINISTRATORS.
THEY HEARD THIS POP, POP, POP IN

190
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
THE HALLWAY.

191
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
THEY WENT TO INVESTIGATE AND AT

192
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
WHICH POINT WERE CONFRONTED

193
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
POSSIBLY BY THE GUNMAN AND THEY

194
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
NEVER RETURNED.

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
BUT MARY SHERLACH WAS DESCRIBED

196
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
BY PEOPLE THAT KNEW HER AS PART

197
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
OF THE CRISIS INTERVENTION TEAM.

198
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
SO THIS A PERSON, WOLF, THAT

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
PEOPLE WOULD BE GOING TO AND

200
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
GRIEVING WITH AT A TIME LIKE

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
THIS AND SHE'S NO LONGER AROUND

202
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
FOR PEOPLE TO TALK TO.
SHE'S NOT WITH US ANYMORE.

203
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
SHE WAS AN EXPERT IN

204
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
PSYCHOLOGIST.

205
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
SHE GOT HER MASTER'S FROM

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
SOUTHERN CONNECTICUT UNIVERSITY

207
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
AND SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING

208
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
IN THE COMMUNITY AND DID A LOT

209
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
OF WORK WITH DISABLED ADULTS.

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
THOSE ARE JUST TWO OF THE NAMES

211
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
OF THE 26 VICTIMS THAT FELL

212
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
VICTIM TO THE SHOOTER IN

213
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
WOLF?
>> TWO NAMES AND THEY ARE GOING

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
TO BE RELEASING THE REST OF THE

216
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
NAMES.
WE'RE STANDING BY FOR ANOTHER

217
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
NEWS CONFERENCE.

218
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
WE THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

219
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
FAIRLY SOON.
WITH MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS

220
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
RIGHT NOW, AT LEAST ON THIS

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
MORNING ABOUT THE POSSIBLE

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
MOTIVES OF THIS 20-YEAR-OLD

223
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
SHOOTER, ADAM LANZA, WE'RE

224
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
CONTINUING TO TRY TO GET

225
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
INFORMATION ON WHAT HAPPENED.

226
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
POLICE SAY HE KILLED HIS MOTHER

227
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
BEFORE THE RAMPAGE AT THE SCHOOL

228
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
WHERE HE THEN EVENTUALLY TOOK

229
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
HIS OWN LIFE.

230
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
CNN'S MARY SNOW IS JOINING US

231
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
FROM OUTSIDE THE LANZA HOME IN

232
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.
WHAT DID WE LEARN ABOUT ADAM

233
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
LANZA AND HIS POSSIBLE MOTIVE?

234
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
>> Reporter: WOLF, YOU KNOW,

235
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
SHORTLY AFTER YESTERDAY'S

236
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
HORRIFIC MASSACRE, POLICE AND

237
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
S.W.A.T. TEAMS DESCENDED ON THE

238
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
LANZA HOME WHERE IT IS BELIEVED
THAT ADAM LANZA LIVED WITH HIS

239
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
MOTHER.

240
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
AND WHAT POLICE NOW ARE SAYING

241
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
IN TERM OF A POTENTIAL MOTIVE,

242
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
LIEUTENANT PAUL VANCE OF THE

243
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE SAID

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
THAT INVESTIGATORS ARE

245
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
RECOVERING WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS,

246
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
IN HIS WORDS, AS GOOD EVIDENCE

247
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
TO POSSIBLY FILL IN THE BLANKS

248
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
OF WHY OR HOW THIS COULD HAVE

249
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
OCCURRED.

250
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
AND HE GAVE THAT ANSWER WHEN

251
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
ASKED WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE

252
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
ANY E-MAILS OR ANY WRITINGS THAT

253
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
WOULD GIVE ANY CLUES ABOUT A POE

254
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
TE

255
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
POTENTIAL MOTIVE.

256
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
WE HAVE NEW INFORMATION ABOUT

257
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
FROM SUSAN CANDIOTTI.
SHE IS QUOTING A LAW ENFORCEMENT

258
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
OFFICIAL WHO SAID THAT HE HAD

259
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
ACCESS TO MORE GUNS THAN THE

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THREE GUNS RECOVERED.

261
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
SHE'S QUOTING A SOURCE THAT

262
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
POLICE RECOVERED THREE

263
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
ADDITIONAL GUNS.

264
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
AND THIS WAS ELSEWHERE, NOT AT

265
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
THE SCENE OF THE SHOOTING.

266
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
A .45 REVOLVER HAND REPEATING

267
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
AND CNN HAS BEEN REPORTING THAT

268
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
POLICE DID RECOVER THREE

269
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
WEAPONS, TWO HANDGUNS AND A

270
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE AND THAT

271
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
THOSE GUNS HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY

272
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
NANCY LANZA.

273
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
THERE IS NOT MUCH WE KNOW ABOUT

274
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
NANCY LANZA.

275
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
WE SPOKE TO A NEIGHBOR A SHORT

276
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
TIME AGO.
SHE TOLD US THAT THERE WAS

277
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY

278
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
ABOUT NANCY LANZA.

279
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
>> SHE WAS LIKE A NORMAL ANYBODY

280
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
ELSE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

281
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
YOU KNOW, DECORATE THE HOUSE AND

282
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
THE HOUSE WAS ALWAYS, YOU KNOW,

283
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
PRISTINE.
SHE WAS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER

284
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
HOUSEWIFE.

285
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
>> Reporter: AND THAT NEIGHBOR

286
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
WAS SAYING THAT AS FAR AS SHE

287
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
KNEW THAT NANCY LANZA FROM THE

288
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
TIME THAT SHE KNEW HER, SHE WAS

289
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
A STAY-AT-HOME MOM AND SAW HER A

290
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

291
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
THE FAMILY WAS DESCRIBED AS NOT

292
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
BEING VERY SOCIAL, BEING VERY

293
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
QUIET.

294
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
WOLF?
>> MARY, THANKS VERY MUCH.

295
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
SANJAY GUPTA IS HERE, OUR CHIEF

296
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT.

297
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
YOU JUST CAME BACK FROM THE

298
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
CRISIS CENTER.

299
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
TELL US WHAT YOU SAW AND WHAT

300
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
WAS GOING ON.

301
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
>> IT WAS UNCLEAR TO ME HOW MANY
PEOPLE WOULD BE USING THE CENTER

302
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S AT

303
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL A MILE FROM

304
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
HERE.
IT'S SET UP BY DANBURY HOSPITAL,

305
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
THE HOSPITAL THAT TREATED THE

306
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
FEW THAT WERE WOUNDED YESTERDAY.

307
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
THERE WERE PROBABLY ABOUT 100

308
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
CARS IN THE PARKING LOT.

309
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
OBVIOUSLY OUT OF RESPECT FOR

310
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
PRIVACY WE DID NOT FILM THEM.

311
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
FAMILIES COMING IN, SMALL

312
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
CHILDREN, SOME SINGLE MOMS AND

313
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
DADS AND ENTIRE FAMILIES AS WELL

314
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
AND THEY ARE STAYING FOR A LONG
TIME.

315
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
THIS ISN'T ONE OF THOSE THINGS
WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING IN AND

316
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
OUT CONSTANTLY.

317
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
THEY WERE GOING IN AND STAYING

318
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
IN FOR QUITE A WHILE.

319
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
THE WHOLE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

320
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
DEDICATED TO THIS TODAY FOR 12

321
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
HOURS.
IN ADDITION, YALE NEW HAVEN

322
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
WHICH HAS A NATIONALLY

323
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
RENOWNED --

324
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
>> YALE UNIVERSITY?

325
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
>> YALE UNIVERSITY.

326
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
THEY ARE NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE.

327
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
THEY HAVE A PHONE LINE SET UP
AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CALLING IN

328
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
NOT ONLY FROM THIS AREA BUT FROM

329
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

330
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

331
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
HEARING PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE

332
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
COUNTRY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY

333
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
AND USING SOME OF THESE

334
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
RESOURCES.
>> SO THEY ARE BRINGING IN A

335
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
PSYCHOLOGIST AND PSYCHIATRIST

336
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS AS WELL?

337
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

338
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
PARTICULARLY CHILD COUNSELORS,

339
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
THE PEOPLE WHO SPECIALIZE IN

340
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
DEALING WITH CHILDREN.

341
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
THEY HAVE PSYCHOLOGISTS AND

342
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
PSYCHIATRISTS, OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE

343
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
WHO ARE MEDICAL DOCTORS.

344
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
THK THEY CAN PRESCRIBE

345
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
MEDICATIONS.
AGAIN, PEOPLE ARE CLEARLY USING

346
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
THESE RESOURCES.

347
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK,

348
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
OBVIOUSLY, IN THE PARKING LOT

349
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
ABOUT IT, GOING IN QUITE

350
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
PRIVATELY.
BUT YOU CAN TELL THAT THERE'S A

351
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
HUGE DEMAND, WOLF.
>> BECAUSE IF YOU'RE A MOM,

352
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
YOU'RE A DAD AND YOU'VE SEEN

353
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
WHAT'S GOING ON, FORTUNATELY

354
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
LET'S SAY YOUR KIDS ARE OKAY BUT

355
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
YOU'RE STILL IN A STATE OF
SHOCK, WHAT KIND OF MEDICAL

356
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
TREATMENT -- THERE ARE PROBABLY

357
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
SOME PRESCRIPTIONS, SOME DRUGS

358
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
THAT YOU CAN GIVE, BUT WHAT DO

359
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
YOU DO?
>> YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS

360
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
THAT I -- AND YOU AND I HAVE

361
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
COVERED A LOT OF THESE.

362
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
BUT FOR PARENTS REALLY CHECKING

363
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
THEIR OWN FEELINGS FIRST.

364
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
MAKING SURE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN

365
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
FEELINGS IN CONTROL.

366
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
IT'S BEEN HARD FOR ME AND I'M

367
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
SURE FOR YOU AS WELL TO MAKE

368
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
SURE THAT YOU HAVE SOME CONTROL

369
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
OF YOUR FEELINGS AND THEN BEING

370
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE ABOUT

371
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
THIS.
ONE OF THE TECHNIQUES THAT I

372
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
THINK REALLY SEEMS TO MAKE A

373
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
DIFFERENCE AND I KEEP HEARING

374
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
THIS FROM THE EXPERTS IN THIS

375
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
FIELD IS LET THE CHILD IN THIS

376
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
CASE DO THE TALKING FIRST.

377
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
REALLY GET AN IDEA OF HOW MUCH

378
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
THEY KNOW AND THEN SLOWLY FILL

379
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
IN DETAILS BUT NOT TOO

380
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
PHOTOGRAPH SPECIFGRAPHIC

381
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
DETAILS.
IT SOUNDS ALMOST TOO SIMPLE IN A

382
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS, TOO SMALL,

383
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
BUT IT CAN MAKE A BIG

384
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
DIFFERENCE.
IT'S AROUND THE HOLIDAYS.

385
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
PEOPLE MAY HAVE HOLIDAY

386
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
ACTIVITIES, SOCCER PRACTICE,

387
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
THINGS LIKE THAT.

388
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
GETTING BACK INTO THAT GROOVE.

389
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
WHAT THEY FIND IS IF YOU CAN

390
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
ESTABLISH THAT SOONER RATHER

391
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
THAN LATER, YOU'RE MUCH MORE

392
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
LIKELY TO REALLY MITIGATE SOME

393
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
OF THESE SYMPTOMS.

394
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE
DATA, FOR EXAMPLE, FROM VIRGINIA

395
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
TECH.

396
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
EVEN ABOUT THREE TO FOUR MONTHS
AFTERWARDS, ABOUT 15% OF PEOPLE

397
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
STILL HAD SIGNIFICANT PTSD.

398
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
IF PEOPLE ACTUALLY SAW SOME OF

399
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
THE VIOLENCE, IT WENT UP TO AS

400
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
HIGH AS 77%.

401
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
YOU TYPICALLY THINK OF PTSD

402
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE IN ADULTS

403
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
BUT YOU CLEARLY SEE IT IN

404
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
CHILDREN AS WELL AND WE'RE

405
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
GETTING MORE AND MORE EVIDENCE

406
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
OF THAT ALL THE TIME.
>> WOULD IT BE SMART FOR THESE

407
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
LITTLE KIDS, THERE ARE UNDER 600

408
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
KIDS WHO WERE AT THIS ELEMENTARY

409
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
SCHOOL, TO GO BACK TO THAT

410
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND BEGIN THAT

411
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
ROUTINE OF GOING BACK TO SCHOOL?

412
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
>> YES.

413
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
BUT THE QUESTION IS AND I ASKED

414
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
THE SAME QUESTION, THE QUESTION

415
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
IS WHEN.

416
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
EVEN THE REED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

417
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
SOME DISSTRANS FROM HERE, I

418
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.

419
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
YES, ULTIMATELY THAT HAS TO BE

420
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
THE ANSWER BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO

421
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
RE-ESTABLISH THAT ROUTINE AND

422
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
YOU ALSO HAVE TO MAKE IT CLEAR

423
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
THAT WHILE SOMETHING TERRIBLE

424
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
HAPPENED HERE AND VERY

425
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
FRIGHTENING, THIS CAN STILL BE A

426
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
PLACE THAT CAN BE SAFE FOR THEM.

427
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
>> I'M GLAD THEY ARE BRINGING IN

428
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
A LOT OF PROFESSIONALS WITH A
LOT OF EXPERIENCE.

429
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAN SAY.

430
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I GUESS THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL
IS ONE THING, CLERGY CAN BE VERY

431
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
HELPFUL, TOO.

432
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
>> AND THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE.
IT'S INTERESTING, ONE THING THAT

433
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
ALWAYS COMES UP IS THAT

434
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
EVERYBODY SUFFERS HERE SOMEWHAT.

435
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
AND I THINK PEOPLE TEND TO FEEL

436
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
VERY ISOLATED.

437
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
SO WHEN YOU HAVE THESE TYPES OF

438
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
FACILITIES, WHERE PEOPLE ARE
COMING TOGETHER, BESIDES THE

439
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
COUNSELORS, BESIDES THE

440
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS, PSYCHIATRISTS,

441
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
EVEN THE CLERGY AND SEEING YOUR

442
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
FELLOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS GOING

443
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
THROUGH THE SAME THING THAT

444
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, THAT'S

445
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
PART OF THE PURPOSE OF CREATING

446
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
A CENTRAL PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN

447
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
DO THIS.

448
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
BECAUSE THAT FEELING OF
ISOLATION I THINK CAN BE QUITE

449
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
TROUBLESOME.

450
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
>> SANJAY, THANK YOU FOR THAT
REPORT.

451
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
SANJAY IS GOING TO BE WITH US

452
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
OBVIOUSLY THROUGHOUT ALL OF OUR

453
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
COVERAGE TODAY, TOMORROW, WE'RE

454
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
HERE IN CONNECTICUT.
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

455
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
THIS STORY HAS RESONATED TO SO

456
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD.

457
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
WE'RE ALSO WATCHING THE

458
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
INVESTIGATION AS IT IS UNFOLDING
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES AT

459
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
STAKE IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

460
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
LOU PALUMBO IS JOINING US.

461
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
HE KNOWS HOW THESE

462
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
INVESTIGATIONS UNFOLD.

463
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
WATCH US HOW -- IF YOU WERE

464
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
INVOLVED IN THIS VINVESTIGATION

465
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
WHAT'S THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT

466
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
THING THAT YOU WOULD BE DOING

467
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
RIGHT NOW?
>> CERTAINLY TRYING TO ESTABLISH

468
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
WHETHER OR NOT THIS GENTLEMAN

469
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
HAD ANYONE ACT IN CONCERT WITH

470
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
HIM AND ATTEMPTING TO DETERMINE

471
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
SPECIFICALLY HOW HE WAS ABLE TO

472
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
GAIN ACCESS TO THE SCHOOL.

473
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
AND WE DO HAVE SOME INFORMATION

474
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
REGARDING THE ACCESS ISSUE.

475
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
BUT THE INVESTIGATION THAT THEY

476
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
ARE CONDUCTING IS GOING TO BE

477
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
ONGOING FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

478
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
>> DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS?

479
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
HOW LONG DOES AN INVESTIGATION

480
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
LIKE THIS ROUTINELY AND THIS IS

481
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
FAR FROM ROUTINE, GO ON?

482
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
>> WELL, EVERY INVESTIGATION

483
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
STANDS ON IT IS OWN MERIT AND

484
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
THE SEVERITY AND NATURE OF THE

485
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
INCIDENT, IT COULD TAKE A COUPLE

486
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
OF DAYS.

487
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I KNOW THAT THE POLICE INITIALLY

488
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
ALLUDED TO WRAPPING UP IN THE

489
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
NEXT DAY OR SO.

490
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT THEY

491
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
ARE PROBABLY ON POINT BUT THE
INVESTIGATION ISN'T JUST

492
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
FOCUSING ON THIS CLASSROOM, AS

493
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
THEY ALREADY HE CEXPLAINED.

494
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
IT'S ALSO FOCUSED ON THE

495
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
RESIDENCE OF THE MOTHER AND THIS

496
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
SHOOTER.
SO THIS INVESTIGATION HAS SOME

497
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
TIME.
THERE'S A LOT OF DURATION THAT

498
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
THEY HAVE TO COMPILE, THINGS

499
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
LIKE DISTANCE FROM THE VICTIMS,

500
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
ANGLES, NUMBER OF SHOTS FIRED,

501
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
RECOVERY OF THE CASINGS, TRYING

502
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
TO FIND THE BULLETS IN WALLS.

503
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
TO RETRIEVE THEM AND CONCLUDE

504
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
BALLASTICALLY THAT THEY CAME

505
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
FROM A WEAPON.

506
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I THINK THEY HAVE A LOT OF WORK

507
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
TO DO YET.

508
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
THEY ARE STILL GOING TO GO

509
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
OUT -- EVEN THOUGH THEY REALIZE

510
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
THAT HIS MOM LEGALLY ACQUIRED

511
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
THE WEAPONS, THEY ARE GOING TO

512
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
FIND OUT WHERE SHE ACQUIRED THEM

513
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
AS WELL AS HOW SHE WAS ABLE TO

514
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
GET THE WEAPONS FROM THE HOUSE

515
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
IN WHICH HE RESIDED.

516
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
WE ARE ALL WORKING FROM THE

517
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
PREMISE THAT SHE HADN'T PROPERLY

518
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
SECURED THEM.

519
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
SHE MAY HAVE ESPECIALLY WITH THE
FACT THAT HE HAD A PERSONALITY

520
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
DISORDER.
THE INVESTIGATION WILL FURTHER

521
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
TELL US IF HE BEAT HER UP,

522
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
FORCING HER TO SURRENDER THESE

523
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
WEAPONS.

524
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION
THAT HAS TO BE TIED TOGETHER

525
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
YET.
>> DEBRA FREYRICK HAS A QUESTION

526
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
FOR YOU.
>> WHY DO YOU THINK THAT NANCY

527
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
LANZA WOULD NEED A GUN IN THAT

528
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
TIGHT-KNIT, MIDDLE-INCOME OF A

529
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
FLEW WENT COMMUNITY?

530
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
WHY THE NEED FOR A GUN?

531
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
>> WELL, QUITE CANDIDLY, ALL

532
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
SHE'D HAVE TO DO IS WATCH THE

533
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
NEWS WHERE WE HAVE A CONCERN

534
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
ABOUT TAKING YOUR CHILD TO THE

535
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
MOVIE THEATER OR SHOPPING MALL

536
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
OR SENDING THEM TO A SCHOOL OR

537
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
UNIVERSITY.

538
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
ANY ONE OF THESE DENOMINATORS

539
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
COULD PROMPT A PERSON TO BELIEVE

540
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
THAT THEY NEED A TOOL OF THIS

541
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
TYPE.
THE QUESTION IS, WHY DID SHE

542
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
HAVE A SIG SAUER P 229 OR --

543
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
THERE'S A NUMBER OF

544
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
CONFIGURATIONS OR A GLOCK

545
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
PISTOL.
THEY ARE BOTH HIGH-POWERED

546
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC AND IN A GLOCK 17,

547
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
BLOCK 19 OR BLOCK 26.

548
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
AND THEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE M4

549
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
CARBINE OF THE BUSHMASTER.

550
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
THIS IS ALL CONJECTURE.

551
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
MAYBE SHE FELT LIKE SHE NEEDED

552
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
TO HAVE TOOLS LIKE THIS TO

553
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
PROTECT HER FAMILY.

554
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
THIS IS ALL CONJECTURE.

555
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
IT'S DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY

556
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
YOU WOULD HAVE MULTIPLE WEAPONS

557
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
OF THESE TYPES.

558
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER SOMETHING

559
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
OF THESE WEAPONS.

560
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
THESE ARE WEAPONS THAT ARE

561
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
DESIGNED TO STAGE ASSAULT OR

562
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
RESPOND TO AN ASSAULT.

563
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
THAT'S THEIR ONLY PURPOSE BLOCK

564
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
17 OR OTHER GLOCKS ARE NOT

565
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
HUNTING VESSELS.

566
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
IT'S DESIGNED AS AN OFFENSIVE OR

567
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
DEFENSIVE WEAPON.

568
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
>> THAT'S A BIG QUESTION.

569
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
CLEARLY A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS

570
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
LOOKING INTO WHY SHE HAD THOSE
TYPES OF WEAPONS, WHETHER THERE

571
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
WAS A REASON FOR THAT.

572
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
WE TALKED ABOUT PSYCHOLOGICAL

573
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
TESTING HOW PEOPLE CAN BUY A GUN

574
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
WITHOUT PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING

575
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
BUT THIS TAKES US TO ANOTHER

576
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
LEVEL BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY IS

577
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
GOING TO FORCE POSSESSION OF A

578
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
GUN, THAT'S SOMETHING TOTALLY

579
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
DIFFERENT.

580
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
WOLF?
>> LOU PALUMBO, THANK YOU AS

581
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
WELL.

582
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
>> COLUMBINE RIGHT NOW HERE AT

583
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

584
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
WITH EVERY SCHOOL SHOOTING,

585
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
EVERY PARENT THINKS, IT COULD

586
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
HAVE BEEN MY CHILD, GOD FORBID.

587
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
WHAT CAN WE DO TO SAVE

588
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
CHILDREN'S LIVES DOWN THE ROAD?

589
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
MUCH MORE OF OUR SPECIAL

590
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
COVERAGE RIGHT AFTER THIS.

591
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
>>> WE HAVE JUST BEEN TOLD THAT

592
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
THE SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY

593
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
CLINTON HAS SUFFERED A

594
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
CONCUSSION.
A STATEMENT RELEASED BY THE

595
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
STATE DEPARTMENT, I'LL JUST READ

596
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
IT TO YOU.

597
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
HERE IT IS.

598
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
AND OUR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

599
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
SECRETARY RELEASING THIS

600
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
STATEMENT.
WHILE SUFFERING FROM A STOP MASS

601
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
VIRUS, SECRETARY CLINTON BECAME

602
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
DEHYDRATED AND FAINTED

603
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
SUSTAINING A CONCUSSION.

604
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
SHE HAS BEEN RECOVERING AT HOME

605
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE

606
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
MONITORED REGULARLY BY HER

607
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
DOCTORS.
SHE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FROM

608
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
HOME NEXT WEEK STAYING IN

609
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
REGULAR CONTACT WITH OFFICIALS.

610
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
SHE'S LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING

611
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
BACK IN OFFICE SOON.
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, A NEUROSURGEON

612
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
HIMSELF, HE'S HERE.

613
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
SANJAY, SHE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT

614
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
FEELING WELL.

615
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
SHE MUST HAVE FALLEN, I ASSUME,

616
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
HIT HER HEAD, AND SUFFERS A

617
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
CONCUSSION?
>> YEAH.
THE FIRST THING -- THE FAINTING

618
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
PRECEDED THE CONCUSSION.

619
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
ONE OF THE MOST COMMON THINGS IS

620
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO BECOMES

621
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
DEHYDRATED.

622
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
THAT'S ONE OF THE TOP REASONS

623
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
THAT WOULD COME TO MIND WHEN

624
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
SOMEBODY ELSE THINKS OF A HEART

625
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
CONDITION BUT THEY SAID SHE HAD

626
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
A STOMACH VIRUS.

627
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
TO FAINT TO THE POINT WHERE SHE

628
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
HIT HER HEAD, SHE DIDN'T BRACE

629
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
HERSELF SO SOUNDS LIKE SHE WAS

630
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
REALLY -- THE FAINTING SPELL WAS

631
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
QUITE SIGNIFICANT.

632
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
WITH A CONCUSSION ITSELF,

633
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
DOESN'T MEAN YOU NECESSARILY

634
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS.

635
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
WHAT I READ INTO THE STATEMENT

636
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
SPECIFICALLY IS THAT THEY ARE

637
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
ALLOWING HER TO REST AT HOME.

638
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
IF THEY HAD SAID THAT SHE NEEDED
TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN THE

639
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
HOSPITAL OR SOMETHING ELSE, THAT

640
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
WOULD CLEARLY BE OF MORE

641
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
CONCERN.
BUT THIS SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING

642
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
SHE SHOULD RECOVER FROM JUST

643
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
FINE.
IT'S OBVIOUSLY UNFORTUNATE AND

644
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
THE STOMACH VIRUS CAN MAKE

645
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
SOMEBODY DEHYDRATED TO THE POINT

646
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
WHERE YOU GET THAT FAINT, THAT'S

647
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
A CONCERN.

648
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
BEING THAT SHE IS AT HOME, SHE

649
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
PROBABLY DIDN'T NEED A C.A.T.

650
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
SCAN OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

651
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
>> AS A PRECAUTION, SECRETARY OF
STATE, SHE HAS A CONCUSSION, SHE

652
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
FANTS, YOU WOU

653
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
FAINTS, YOU WOULD THINK THAT
THEY WOULD WANT TO DO SOME

654
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
TESTING.
>> MAYBE THEY DID SOME TESTING,

655
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
BUT WHATEVER IT SHOWED IN THE

656
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
END DIDN'T WARRANT HER STAYING

657
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
IN THE HOSPITAL.

658
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
YOU WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE

659
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
THERE WASN'T ANY BLOOD ON THE

660
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
BRAIN.
>> OUR REPORTER IS ON THE PHONE.

661
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
ELISE, YOU HAVE MORE

662
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
INFORMATION?

663
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
WAS SHE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL

664
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
FOR TESTING, CAT SCANS, OTHER

665
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
TESTS?

666
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
>> Reporter: SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY

667
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
TAKEN TO THE DOCTOR.

668
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
IN THE LAST WEEK, WE'VE BEEN

669
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
TALKING ABOUT THIS VIRUS THAT
SHE HAD.

670
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
AS YOU KNOW, SHE KEEPS THIS

671
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
PUNISHING SCHEDULE, WOLF.

672
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
THE LAST WEEK OR SO SHE'S REALLY

673
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
BEEN DOWN FOR THE COUNT.

674
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
YOU KNOW, EVEN THE STATE

675
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
DEPARTMENT HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE

676
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
THAT THE STOMACH VIRUS WAS, YOU

677
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
KNOW, REALLY HIT SECRETARY

678
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
CLINTON HARD.

679
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
DEHYDRATION, FATIGUE, EVERYTHING

680
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
LIKE THAT.

681
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
THE FACT THAT SHE'S AT HOME, WE

682
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
KNOW SECRETARY CLINTON.

683
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
SHE NEVER REALLY STOPS WORKING.

684
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
SHE'LL CONTINUE TO MAKE CALLS

685
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
AND THE SUCH.

686
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
BUT THE FACT THAT SHE'S NOT IN

687
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW SIGNIFIES

688
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
THAT HER DOCTORS THINK THAT

689
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
SHE'S OUT OF THE WOODS IN TERMS

690
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
OF ANY KIND OF SERIOUS INJURY.

691
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
>> I KNOW LAST WEEK SHE WAS

692
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
SUPPOSED TO GO ON AN IMPORTANT

693
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
TRIP TO MOROCCO.

694
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
SHE CANCELED THAT TRIP WHICH WAS

695
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
HIGHLY UNUSUAL, SENDING HER

696
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
DEPUTY TO MOROCCO FOR AN

697
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
IMPORTANT VISIT TO THAT NORTH

698
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
AFRICAN COUNTRY.

699
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
YOU'VE COVERED HER FOR THESE

700
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
LAST FOUR YEARS.

701
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
HOW EXTRAORDINARY IS IT THAT SHE

702
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
CANCELS A FOREIGN VISIT LIKE

703
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
THIS?
>> WOLF, I'VE BEEN COVERING

704
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
SECRETARY CLINTON SINCE SHE

705
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
STARTED.

706
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'VE DONE MANY TRAVELS WITH HER.

707
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
THE ONLY OTHER TIME SHE CANCELED

708
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
A TRIP IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS IS

709
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
WHEN HER MOTHER, WHO SHE IS VERY

710
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
CLOSE TO, FELL ILL AND DIED A

711
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
FEW DAYS LATER.

712
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
WHEN SHE DOESN'T FEEL GOOD, SHE

713
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
KEEPS A PUNISHING SCHEDULE.

714
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
SHE KEEPS A SCHEDULE THAT EVEN
SOME OF THE JOURNALISTS CAN'T

715
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
KEEP UP WITH HER.

716
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
SHE'S REALLY ALWAYS RUNNING,
ALWAYS WORKING, ALWAYS ON THE

717
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
JOB.
SO FOR HER, LAST WEEK, TO CANCEL

718
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
THIS TRIP WAS REALLY, REALLY

719
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
EXTRAORDINARY AND A LOT OF

720
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
PEOPLE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT,

721
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
WELL, IS THIS A MORE SERIOUS

722
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
CASE OF SOMETHING, SOME KIND OF

723
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
ILLNESS?

724
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
BUT, NO, WE JUST UNDERSTAND

725
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE

726
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
ON HER TRIP THAT ALSO FELL ILL.

727
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
NOT AS SICK AS SECRETARY CLINTON

728
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
BUT THEY SAID, LOOK, THIS IS A

729
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
REALLY BAD VIRUS, REALLY PUTS
YOU DOWN FOR THE COUNT, AND SHE

730
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
JUST NEEDED A LOT OF REST, A LOT

731
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
OF FLUIDS AND CARE.

732
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
>> YEAH.

733
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE A VIRUS,

734
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
AS SANJAY IS HERE, AND IT'S

735
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
ANOTHER THING TO BE ACTUALLY

736
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
DEHYDRATED AND FAINT BUT THEN TO
HIT YOUR HEAD AND HAVE A

737
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
CONCUSSION, WALK US THROUGH.

738
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
THERE ARE CONCUSSION AND THERE

739
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
ARE CONCUSSIONS.

740
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
THERE ARE VARIOUS DEGREES OF

741
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
CONCUSSION.

742
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
>> RIGHT.

743
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
AS YOU KNOW, I WORKED FOR HER

744
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
WHEN SHE WAS FIRST LADY.

745
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
>> WHEN YOU WERE A WHITE HOUSE

746
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
FELLOW?
>> WHEN I WAS A WHITE HOUSE

747
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
FELLOW.

748
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
>> SHE WOULD BE SOLE NOOL HER
WORK, SHE WOULD HAVE TO BE

749
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
REMINDED TO EAT AND DRINK.

750
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
IT'S SOMETHING THAT ANY DOCTOR

751
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
WOULD CERTAINLY BE CONCERNED

752
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
ABOUT AND WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU

753
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
DROP YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE.

754
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
YOU'RE SIMPLY NOT GETTING ENOUGH

755
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
AND A MINOR FAINTING SPELL, IT

756
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
WAS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH WHEN YOU

757
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
FALL AND BRACE WITH YOUR HAND,

758
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
THE INSTINCT IS TO PROTECT YOUR

759
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
HEAD.

760
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM WHAT WE'RE

761
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
READING, SHE WAS OUT ENOUGH TO

762
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
NOT EVEN DO THAT.

763
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
SHE HIT HER HEAD ON THE WAY DOWN

764
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
OR ON THE GROUND ITSELF AND TO

765
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
CAUSE A CONCUSSION CAN.

766
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
AND, AGAIN, A CONCUSSION DOES

767
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
NOT MEAN YOU LOST CONSCIOUSNESS.

768
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
A CONCUSSION CAN SIMPLY MEAN

769
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
THAT YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT OUT OF
IT, YOU MAY HAVE BLURRY VISION,

770
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
RINGING IN YOUR EARS, A HARD

771
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
TIME REMEMBERING WORDS FOR A FEW

772
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
MINUTES, THINGS LIKE THAT.

773
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
BUT THAT'S USUALLY ENOUGH FOR IT

774
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
TO BE CALLED A CONCUSSION AND TO

775
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
GET AT LEAST AN EXAM.

776
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
SOME SORT OF NEUROLOGICAL EXAM.

777
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE GOT A C.A.T.

778
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
SCAN BUT THAT WOULD BE THE

779
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
TYPICAL COURSE.

780
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
>> SHE'S BEING MONITORED
REGULARLY BY HER DOCTORS.

781
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT,

782
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
SHE'S AT HOME.

783
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I ASSUME SHE'S BEING MONITORED

784
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
AT HOME BY HER DOCTORS AS

785
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
OPPOSED TO GOING TO THE

786
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
HOSPITAL.

787
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
>> AND THAT'S CLEARLY A GOOD

788
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
SIGN.
MOST WOULD SAY IF THEY HAD A

789
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
HEIGHTENED CONCERN, IT'S BEST

790
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
THAT YOU STAY IN THE HOSPITAL

791
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
AND WE CAN OBSERVE YOU.
BUT THE KEY IS THAT USUALLY

792
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
SOMEONE WANTS TO BE -- THEY NEED

793
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
TO CHECK THE PERSON EVERY HOUR

794
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
OR SO AND DO A NEUROLOGICAL

795
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
EXAM.

796
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
>> WALK US THROUGH -- SECRETARY

797
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
CLINTON FAINTED, SHE'S GOT A
STOMACH VIRUS, SHE HIT HER HEAD.

798
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

799
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
HOW WOULD YOU TEST WITHOUT GOING

800
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
THROUGH A C.A.T. SCAN OR

801
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
ANYTHING BUYING LIKE THAT?

802
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
>> AS SIMPLE AS IT SOUNDS, THAT

803
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
IS CERTAINLY PART OF IT.

804
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
FIRST OF ALL, YOU WANT TO
ADDRESS THE FAINTING THING SO

805
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
SHE MIGHT NEED SOME FLUIDS.

806
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
SOMETIMES SOMEONE WOULD NEED AN

807
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I.V. TO GET REHYDRATED.

808
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM.

809
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
AS FAR AS THE NEUROLOGICAL

810
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
PROBLEM, WHAT A CONCUSSION MEANS

811
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
IS THE WAY THAT YOU INTERPRET

812
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THE WORLD HAS BEEN ALTERED IN

813
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
SOME WAY, DECREASE CESSATION.

814
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
YOU DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE

815
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
SAYING, EYE MOVEMENTS, CHECK

816
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
HEARING, ASK THEM QUESTIONS,

817
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ORIENTED

818
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
TO WHO THEY ARE, WHERE THEY ARE,

819
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
THE TIME THAT IT IS.
SO THESE SORTS OF QUESTIONS.

820
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
AFTER A WHILE YOU GET A PRETTY

821
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
GOOD IDEA.

822
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
MY GUESS IS THAT HER VISION IS

823
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
NORMAL AND THEY WANT TO MAKE

824
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
SURE THAT IT STAYS NORMAL.

825
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
>> OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE

826
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
TAKEN HER TO THE HOSPITAL?

827
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
>> EXACTLY.

828
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
>> LET'S HOPE THAT SHE RECOVERS

829
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
COMPLETELY.

830
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
WE ASSUME SHE WILL.

831
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO TESTIFY ON

832
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
DECEMBER 20th ON THE BENGHAZI.

833
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I ASSUME SHE'S IN NO SITUATION

834
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
TO GO TO CAPITOL HILL AND

835
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
TESTIFY.
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM WHAT HER

836
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
DOCTORS ARE SAYING IS THEY WANT
HER AT HOME FOR ABOUT A WOEEK.

837
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
>> LET HER REST AND RECOVER.

838
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I TRAVELED WITH HER ON ONE TRIP

839
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
TO FRANCE AND I SAW HOW HARD SHE

840
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
WORKS.
>> TIRE YOU OUT EVEN, WOLF IN.

841
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
>> I WAS EXHAUSTED BUT SHE KEPT

842
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
ON MOVING AND MOVING.

843
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
WE, OF COURSE, WISH SECRETARY OF

844
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
STATE HILLARY CLINTON A SPEEDY

845
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
RECOVERY.

846
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
SHE'S SUFFERING FROM A STOMACH

847
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
VIRUS, BECAME DEHYDRATED,

848
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
FAINTED, AND SUSTAINED A

849
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
CONCUSSION.
SHE'S AT HOME RECOUPING AND

850
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
DOCTORS ARE TAKING CARE OF HER.
>>> WE'RE HERE IN CONNECTICUT.

851
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
WE'RE WATCHING THIS HORRIFIC

852
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
TRAGEDY UNFOLD.

853
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
THERE IS NEW INFORMATION COMING
OUT.

854
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
WE'RE STANDING BY, BY THE WAY,

855
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
FOR A NEWS CONFERENCE.

856
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
WE EXPECT TO GET THE NAMES OF
THE VICTIMS.

857
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
20 CHILDREN, FOR EXAMPLE, 20 OF

858
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
THOSE 26 PEOPLE SHOT IN THIS

859
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BEHIND ME HERE

860
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
IN CONNECTICUT.

861
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
WE'RE GOING TO GET THOSE NAMES

862
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
FAIRLY SOON.

863
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
THIS IS A MASSACRE THAT HAS

864
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
RESONATED NOT ONLY HERE BUT

865
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
AROUND THE COUNTRY.

866
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
JOSH LEVS IS JOINING US.

867
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
>> WE LOST WOLF.
I'M GOING TO TAKE OVER.

868
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO

869
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
YOU ABOUT.

870
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
THIS IS VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF

871
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
COLUMBINE.
14 YEARS AGO.

872
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
A LOT OF YOU MIGHT NOT REALIZE,

873
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
BE PEOPLE WHO WERE AT THAT

874
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
MASSACRE, TWO PEOPLE CAME TO

875
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
SCHOOL AND KILLED 14 PEOPLE

876
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
BEFORE TAKING THEIR LIVES.

877
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
NOW MANY PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED

878
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
COLUMBINE ARE OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE

879
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
PEOPLE IN SCHOOL.

880
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I SPOKE TO SOME OF THESE

881
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
SURVIVORS ABOUT HOW THEY ARE

882
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
AFFECTED ABOUT THIS NEWS OUT OF

883
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
CONNECTICUT.
I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A

884
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
WOMAN WHO IS A SURVIVOR FROM

885
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
COLUMBINE, NOW A MOTHER, KACEY

886
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
JOHNSON.
>> YOU LOSE THE SENSE THAT

887
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
THINGS CAN NEVER HAPPEN TO YOU.

888
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
PARENTS WILL SAY, THIS WOULD
NEVER HAPPEN TO ME.

889
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
FOR ME AS A PARENT OF A CHILD, I

890
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
BELIEVE THIS COULD EASILY HAPPEN

891
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
AT MY CHILD'S SCHOOL BUT THAT'S
BECAUSE IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME

892
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
BEFORE.

893
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I WOULD HOPE THAT THE PEOPLE

894
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
INVOLVED WILL WALK BESIDE THESE

895
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES FOR

896
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
THE YEARS TO COME.

897
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
THEY HAVE YEARS AND YEARS OF

898
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
HEALING THAT THEY ARE GOING TO

899
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
BE FACING.

900
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN COME

901
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
BESIDE THEM AND ENCOURAGE THEM

902
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
AND FOCUS POSITIVELY ON THE

903
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
LIVES OF THE ONES THAT WERE

904
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
LOST.

905
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
>> AND THANK TO KCEY FOR THE

906
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
BEAUTIFUL PICTURES OF HER

907
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
FAMILY.
ANOTHER PERSON I WANT TO TALK

908
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
ABOUT IS SHAWN GRAVES WHO LIVES

909
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
IN A WHEELCHAIR.

910
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I SPOKE WITH HIM ABOUT THE

911
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
EFFECT THAT THIS NEWS HAS ON

912
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
HIM.
>> I LIVE WITH PAIN PHYSICALLY

913
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
ON A DAILY BASIS BECAUSE OF THE

914
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
INJURIES THAT I SUSTAINED, BUT

915
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
LOOKING BACK, I TRY NOT TO THINK

916
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
ABOUT IT.

917
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
BUT WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS

918
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
HAPPENS, THAT'S THE FIRST THING

919
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
YOU REALLY DO, YOU BEGIN TO

920
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
RELIVE IT.
AND TURNING IT ON TO THE --

921
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
PUTTING ON THE NEWS AND JUST

922
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
WATCHING THE COVERAGE LIVE FROM

923
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
THIS POINT OF VIEW VERSUS WHERE

924
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I WAS THEN, IT WILL TAKE YOU

925
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
THROUGH AN EMOTIONAL TOLL,

926
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
THAT'S FOR SURE.

927
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
IT TORE ME DOWN.

928
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
MEMBERS OF THAT GROUP, THE SMALL

930
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO REALLY

931
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE

932
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
INSIDE A SCHOOL WHEN A SCHOOL

933
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000

00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
SEVERAL OF THEM AND THEY WERE

938
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000

ALL THEY CAN TO HELP THE

940
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
FAMILIES MOVE FORWARD AND NOT

941
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
JUST TO BE THERE WITH THEM IN

942
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000

WOLF.
>> I THINK THEY CAN HELP,

945
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
INDEED.
I THINK THESE PEOPLE HAVE LIVED

946
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
THROUGH HELL AND MAYBE THEY CAN

947
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
HELP SOME OF THESE PEOPLE HERE
IN CONNECTICUT.

PRESIDENT OBAMA IS PROMISING TO

TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS ONE DOWN THE

THINGS ARE DONE TO PREVENT FROM

1018
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
HAPPENING AGAIN.

1019
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
OUR WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN, BEE

BRIANNA KEILAR IS JOINING US.

WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY SPECIFIC

1022
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
ACTION?
>> Reporter: SPECIFICALLY I

1023
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
DON'T KNOW.

1024
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
WHEN HE SAID THAT YESTERDAY IN

1025
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
DURING HIS WEEKLY ADDRESS, IT'S

1027
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
SOMETHING TO TRY TO AVERT

1029
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS ONE.

1030
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
AND I WILL TELL YOU AT THE WHITE

1031
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
HOUSE, CERTAINLY BEYOND THE

1032
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
WHITE HOUSE, THERE IS A SENSE
THAT WHAT IS IN PLACE ISN'T

1033
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
WORKING.
I MEAN, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN

1034
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
PRESIDENT AND SORT OF OVERSEEN

1035
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000

GIFFORDS.

1039
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
AND THIS SCENE AS WELL TAKES IT

1040
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
TO A NEW LEVEL BECAUSE OF NOT

1041
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
ONLY TRAGIC CRIME.

1042
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO SOME

1043
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
SOURCES WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH
THE OPTIONS THAT THE PRESIDENT

1044
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
MAY HAVE AT HIS DISPOSAL.

1045
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
HE HAS TALKED ABOUT RENEWING A

1046
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
BAN ON SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

1047
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
THERE'S THAT.

1048
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
THERE'S ALSO BEEN TALK OF

1049
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
PERHAPS LIMITING THE NUMBER OF

1050
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
BULLETS AND MAGAZINES OF PERHAPS

1051
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
MOVING FORWARD WITH BETTER

1052
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
LEGISLATION WHEN IT COMES TO

1053
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
MENTAL HEALTH, IDENTIFYING

1054
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS

1055
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
TO WEAPONS, DOING BETTER

1056
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
REPORTING OF THOSE PEOPLE AND

1057
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
THE DETAILS OF THIS PARTICULAR

1058
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
SITUATION, AND THAT WILL INFORM

1059
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
THE CITIZENS.

1060
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
>> THE FAMILIES WHO ARE

1061
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
SUFFERING SO OH MUCH, WILL HE

1062
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
VISIT THEM?
>> NO WORD BUT IT'S SAFE TO SAY

1063
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
THAT HE WILL MAKE THAT TRIP.

1064
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
HE'S DONE THAT IN SITUATIONS

1065
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
LIKE THIS.

1066
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
IT'S NORMALLY A FEW DAYS THAT

1067
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
HAVE PASSED BEFORE HE DOES THAT.

1068
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
HE'S IN CONTACT WITH STATE

1069
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
OFFICIALS.

1070
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
HE'S CERTAINLY TAKING CUES FROM

1071
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
THEM AND WILL BE IN COORDINATION

1072
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
WITH THEM AS HE TRIES TO FIGURE

1073
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
OUT EXACTLY WHETHER AND WHEN HE

1074
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
WILL BE GOING TO CONNECTICUT,

1075
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
WOLF.
>> I'M SURE HE'LL BE HERE SOONER

1076
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
RATHER THAN LATER, BRIANNA.

1077
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
THANKS VERY, VERY MUCH.

1078
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
HERE IS THE KEY QUESTION.

1079
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
WHY?
IT'S A QUESTION ALL OF US ARE

1080
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
ASKING, ALL OF US ARE STRUGGLING

1081
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000

00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
OUT OF THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

1083
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000

WE'LL SPEAK WITH THE PASTOR WHEN

OR JUMPING INTO THE MARKET,
HE GOES WITH PEOPLE HE TRUSTS,

1098
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
WHICH IS WHY HE TRADES
WITH A COMPANY

HIM WITH HIDDEN FEES.

ABOUT OTHER THINGS,

00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
STORY OF HOW THEIR SON MADE IT
OUT OF THAT SCHOOL ALIVE AND HOW

1141
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
VICKY SOTO WAS ABLE TO PROTECT

1142
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000

THEIR SON HAS RECOUNTED THAT

1146
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
ONCE IT WAS CLEAR THAT A SHOOTER

1147
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
WAS IN THE SCHOOL, SHE MOVED THE

1148
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000

1149
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000

AND SOME OF HIS FELLOW STUDENT,

1163

1164
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000

1165
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
THEY RAN STRAIGHT OUT OF THE

1166
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
SCHOOL FROM THERE AND EVENTUALLY

1167
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
MADE IT TO SAFETY.

1174
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000

1176
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000

HOW THEIR 6-YEAR-OLD SON LOVED

1178
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000

1189
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000

1190

AND JUST SEEING THEM TRYING TO

1195

GO BACK -- TO GO ABOUT A NORMAL

1197
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
IN THE MORNING AND PANCAKES THIS

1198
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
MORNING.
THE RELIEF ON THEIR FACES IS

1199
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
JUST AS MUCH SHARED WITH THE

1200
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
GRIEF WHEN THEY KNOW THAT OTHER

1201
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
FAMILIES THIS MORNING ARE NOT

1202
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
ABLE TO TRY TO GET ANY KIND OF

1203
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
SEMBLANCE TO NORMALCY.

1204
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
THEY ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THEY

1205
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO REGISTER

1206
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000

1210
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
OUT SAFELY AND THEY SAY THAT

1211
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000

1212
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000

1213
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
SO MANY OTHER CHILDREN DID NOT

1214
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
AND THEY ARE VERY AWARE OF THAT

1215
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
AND THAT'S WHY THEY WANTED TO

1216
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
SIT DOWN AND SPEAK WITH US, JUST

1217
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000

WHAT HAPPENED, HOW THAT EVIL

1222
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
COULD ENTER THAT CLASSROOM AND

1223
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
STARE DOWN THOSE CHILDREN.

I ASSUME YOU WERE HERE WHEN YOU

1233
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
HEARD ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.

1234
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
CAN YOU SHEAR WITH OUR VIEWERS,

1235
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
THE KEY QUESTION WHY?

1236
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
WAS THERE ANY MOTIVE THAT COULD

1237
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
HAVE CAUSED THIS TRAGEDY?

1238
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
>> I WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR 20

1239
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
YEARS AND FEDERAL PROSECUTOR

1240
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
BEFORE THAT AND I CAN TELL YOU

1241
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE KEY
QUESTIONS.

1242
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
THERE ARE NO ANSWERS AS YET.
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS, THERE

1243
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
IS SO LITTLE DIRECT EVIDENCE

1244
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
THAT REFLECTS ON MOTIVE BUT

1245
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
OBVIOUSLY THE HORROR AND THE

1246
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
GRIEF IS VERY REAL AND I THINK

1247
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
ALL OF OUR HEARTS ARE GOING OUT

1248
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
TO THOSE.
>> DO WE KNOW IF THERE WAS A

1249
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
SUICIDE LETTER OR ANYTHING ALONG

1250
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
THOSE LINES?

1251
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
>> AS OF YET, THERE IS NO DIRECT

1252
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
EVIDENCE THAT I CAN SHARE AT
THIS POINT.

1253
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING.

1254
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I CAN BRIEF REGULARLY AS

1255
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
RECENTLY AS JUST A LITTLE WHILE

1256
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
AGO.
THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUING

1257
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
VERY ACTIVELY INVOLVING THE HOME

1258
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000

AT THE HOME AND THEN DROVE TO

1262
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000

>> THAT IS THE TIMELINE OF WHAT

1265

OCCURRED.
THAT'S GENERALLY WHAT HAPPENED

1267
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
IMMEDIATE OR APPARENT

1268

1269
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
INEXPLICABLE.

1270
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
AT THE SERVICE LAST NIGHT --

1271
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
>> AT THE VIGIL AT THE CHURCH?

1272
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
>> YES, AT THE CHURCH, SENIOR

1273
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
WEISS, AS YOU KNOW, BEGAN WITH

1274
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
THE QUESTION WHY?

1275
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
AND THERE IS NO ANSWER AT THIS

1276
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
POINT.

1277
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
>> THERE MAY NEVER BE AN ANSWER

1278
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
TO THAT QUESTION BECAUSE

1279
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
SOMETIMES WE DON'T KNOW AND

1280
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
THAT'S THAT.

1281
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
BUT CONNECTICUT DOES HAVE PRETTY

1282
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
STRICT GUN CONTROL LAWS ON THE

1283
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
BOOKS RIGHT NOW.

1284
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
BUT WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO DO?

1285
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
YOU WERE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

1286
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
FOR A LONG TIME IN THIS STATE.

1287
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
WHAT ELSE CAN BE DONE TO TRY TO

1288
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
REDUCE THE CHANCES THAT THIS

1289
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
COULD HAPPEN AT ANOTHER

1290
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

1291
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
>> WELL, AS ATTORNEY GENERAL I
FOUGHT FOR GUN SAFETY MEASURES,

1292
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
ASSAULT WITH A BAN IS A MEASURE

1293
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
THAT I DEFENDED IN COURT WHEN IT

1294
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
WAS CHALLENGED CONSTITUTIONALLY,

1295
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
PERSONALLY WENT TO COURT TO

1296
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
DEFEND IT AND I THINK THAT'S A

1297
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
CONVERSATION THAT WE WILL HAVE

1298
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
IN THIS STATE AND AROUND THE

1299
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
COUNTRY, WHAT GREATER MEASURES

1300
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
IN ENFORCEMENT AND IN NEW KINDS

1301
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
OF OVERSIGHT CAN ACHIEVE SAFETY,

1302
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
PARTICULARLY IN OUR SCHOOLS

1303
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
WHERE OBVIOUSLY A TRAGEDY OF

1304
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
THIS KIND IS BEYOND WORDS AND

1305
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
BEYOND COMPREHENSION.

1306
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
>> SUSAN CANDIOTTI, OUR

1307
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
REPORTER, SAID THEY FOUND THREE

1308
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
WEAPONS ON THE SCENE BUT THEY

1309
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
THINK THAT THERE ARE OTHER

1310
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
WEAPONS ELSEWHERE.

1311
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
HAVE YOU HEARD THAT?

1312
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
>> THERE WAS A FOURTH WEAPON

1313
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
RECOVERED IN THE CAR.
THREE WEAPONS ON THE SCENE.

1314
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
TWO OF THEM HANDGUNS, SIG SAUER,

1315
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
A GLOCK, AND THEN A CIVILIAN

1316
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
MODIFICATION OF THE M-16.

1317
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
SO THERE WERE THREE WEAPONS ON

1318
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
THE SCENE.
>> WERE ALL OF THEM USED?

1319
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
>> AND ALL OF THEM WERE USED IN

1320
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
SOME WAY DURING THE SHOOTING.

1321
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
>> DO YOU KNOW IF HE USED ALL OF

1322
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
THE AMMUNITION THAT HE HAD OR

1323
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
WAS THERE STILL AMMUNITION

1324
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
AVAILABLE TO HIM?
>> I CAN'T SAY WHETHER THAT WAS

1325
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
SO.

1326
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
WHETHER ALL OF THE AMMUNITION

1327
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
WAS USED OR NOT.

1328
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
>> BUT THESE WEAPONS WERE

1329
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
REGISTERED IN HIS MOTHER'S NAME?

1330
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
IS THAT RIGHT?

1331
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
>> I CAN'T CONFIRM WHETHER THEY

1332
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
WERE COMPLETELY REGULARLY

1333
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
REGISTERED BUT I'M TOLD AT LEAST

1334
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
ONE WAS REGISTERED IN HER NAME.

1335
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
>> HAVE YOU BEEN IN TOUCH WITH

1336
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
THE WHITE HOUSE, THE PRESIDENT?
I'M ASSUMING HE'LL BE CAN COMING

1337
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
HERE, THERE WILL BE AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO CONSOLE

1338
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO KIDS

1339
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
DIED.
>> I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE

1340
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
PRESIDENT'S HEART AND PRAYER ARE

1341
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
WITH YOU NEWTOWN AT THIS MOMENT.

1342
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
WE'VE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE

1343
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
WHITE HOUSE.

1344
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
THE TIMING OF HIS VISIT IS NOT

1345
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
YET SET, SO FAR AS I KNOW, IF IN

1346
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
FACT HE WILL BE COMING.
THIS WHOLE EPISODE IS IS SO

1347
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
EXTRAORDINARY, AT LEAST IN THE

1348
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
EXPERIENCE OF MOST PEOPLE.

1349
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
THERE MAY BE OTHERS AROUND THE
WORLD THAT HAVE OCCURRED, A

1350
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
COMPARABLE TRAGEDY.

1351
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
BUT 20 LITTLE CHILDREN.

1352
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO

1353
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
BE RESPECTFUL OF THE GRIEF AND

1354
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
THE KINDS OF EXPERIENCE THAT IS

1355
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
REFLECTED HERE.

1356
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
>> DO YOU HAVE A HISTORY HERE IN

1357
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
THIS COMMUNITY?

1358
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
DANBURY IS NOT VERY FAR AWAY.

1359
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
YOU WERE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL,
YOU'RE THE SENATOR.

1360
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
DID YOU KNOW ANY OF THESE

1361
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
VICTIMS?
>> I CAN'T SAY I KNEW THE

1362
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
VICTIMS OR THEIR PARENTS BUT I

1363
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
KNOW THE COMMUNITY WELL.

1364
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
IT'S A STRONG COMMUNITY.

1365
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
IT'S A GREAT SMALL TOWN IN

1366
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
CONNECTICUT.
AND I'M HERE QUITE A BIT AS WELL

1367
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
AS IN DANBURY.

1368
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
REALLY ALL AROUND THE STATE.

1369
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
BUT IT HAS THE STRENGTH AND

1370
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
COURAGE THAT IT HAS

1371
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
DEMONSTRATED.
>> ONE OTHER QUESTION.

1372
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
YOU'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO

1373
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
WASHINGTON.
UNITED STATES SENATE.

1374
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
IS NEW FEDERAL LEGISLATION
NEEDED TO TIGHTEN UP GUN CONTROL

1375
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
IN THE UNITED STATES?

1376
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
>> YOU KNOW, WOLF, I THINK THAT

1377
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
IS A CONVERSATION I'M GOING TO

1378
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
HAVE WITH MY COLLEAGUES.

1379
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
AND TODAY I'M NOT GOING TO

1380
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
DISCUSS THAT OUT OF RESPECT TO

1381
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
THE FAMILIES AND I'M GOING TO BE
BACK BE AGAIN TOMORROW.

1382
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
BUT I'M GOING TO GO TO

1383
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
WASHINGTON AND I'M GOING TO

1384
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
RAISE THIS ISSUE AND I THINK

1385
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
IT'S TIME FOR THE CONVERSATION

1386
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
TO BE RENEWED FOR THE DIALOGUE

1387
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
TO BEGIN AGAIN AND FOR THE

1388
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
SENATE TO CONSIDER WHETHER THAT

1389
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
KIND OF ACTION IS NECESSARY.

1390
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
>> SENATOR BLUMENTHAL, THANK YOU

1391
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
FOR COMING IN.

1392
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
>> THANK YOU.

1393
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
>> OUR DEEP CONDOLENCES TO

1394
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
EVERYONE IN THE STATE.

1395
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
THEY ARE SUFFERING AND SO ARE

1396
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
WE.
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

1397
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
>>> THAT'S IT.

1398
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
WHAT A HORRIFIC STORY.
WHAT ELSE COULD I SAY?

1399
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I WILL BE BACK LATER.

1400
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
A SPECIAL THREE-HOUR "THE

1401
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000

00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
OUR COVERAGE WILL CONTINUE.

1404
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
ALSO WE'RE FOLLOWING THE LATEST

1405
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
OF SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON.

1406
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
SHE SUFFERED A CONCUSSION.

1407
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
SHE FAINTED.

1408
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
SHE'S RECOVERING AT HER HOME IN

1409
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
WASHINGTON.

1410
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES RIGHT

1411
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
AFTER THIS.
From the best
players in history

1412
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
to the number 1 club
in the world.

1413
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
The potential of
Manchester United unlocked.

1414
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
NYSE Euronext.

1415
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Unlocking the world's potential.

1416
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
YOU WON'T TAKE OUR FUTURE.

1417
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
AIDS AFFECTS US ALL.

1418
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
EVEN BABIES.

1419
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
CHEVRON IS WORKING TO STOP
MOTHER-TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION.

1420
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
OUR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES
ARE PART OF THE FIGHT.

1421
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
AND WE'RE WINNING.

1422
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
AT CHEVRON NIGERIA, WE HAVEN'T
HAD A REPORTED CASE IN 12 YEARS.

1423
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
AIDS IS STRONG.
AIDS IS STRONG.

1424
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
BUT WE ARE STRONGER.

1425
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
