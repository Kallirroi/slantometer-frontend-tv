00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
LITTLE BIT OF RAIN IN SANTA ROSA

382
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
YOU CAN SEE A FEW RETURNS UP

383
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
HERE TOWARDS NAPA VERY LIGHT.

384
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
DAY TODAY AS WE ARE IN BETWEEN

386
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
OUR NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM THAT

ARRIVES LATE TONIGHT.

388
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
SO FEW LIGHT RETURNS HERE.

389
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
WE COULD SEE A SHOWER WITH THE

390
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
ATMOSPHERE SO MOIST UNDER THE

391
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
WARM FRONTAL SECTOR OF THIS NEXT

392
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
SYSTEM.
IT SETS THE STAGE FOR WHAT IS

393
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
AHEAD A COLDER AIR MASS NOT AS

394
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000

397
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
THAT SHOULD HAPPEN.

398
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000

MILDER THIS MORNING.

401
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
HOPEFULLY YOU FEEL IT OUT THERE

402
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
AND TAKING THE CHILL OUT OF THE

403
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
AIR.
THE FOG IS A BIT OF A PROBLEM.

404
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
VISIBILITY REDUCED HALF-MOON

EVERY WHERE.

413
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
OTHERWISE THE NEXT SYSTEM

415
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
HERE'S A LOOK AT SATELLITE RADAR

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
LIKE IT COULD SPREAD SEVERAL

456
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
INCHES OF RAIN IN THE NORTH BAY.

457
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
SO WE WILL BE WATCHING THAT

458
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
CLOSELY.
>> ALL RIGHT.

459
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
WE HAVE THAT ONE LITTLE DAY TO

460
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
KIND OF DRY OUT AND PEOPLE CAN

461
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
GET READY FOR BIGGER STUFF

462
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
COMING DOWN THE PIKE.

463
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

464
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
>> THANK YOU, LISA.

465
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
CONNECTICUT SCHOOL TRAGEDY IS

466
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
STIRRING UP THE GUN DEBATE ALL

467
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
OVER THE NATION.

468
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
ONE TEXAS GUN RANGE IS SMACK IN

469
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
THE MIDDLE OF THE CONTROVERSY

470
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
AFTER AN UNUSUAL OPPORTUNITY IN

471
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
SANTA.
>> SMILE.

472
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
>> IT IS CRUHRISTMAS AT THE GUN

473
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
RANGE IT MEANS PICTURES WITH

474
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
SANTA.
AND HIS AR 15.

475
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
>> IT'S A CHILD FRIENDLY EVENT.

476
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
>> I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY

477
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
IMPORTANT TO TRAIN CHILDREN, TO

478
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
EDUCATE THEM, TAKE THE MYSTERY

479
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
OUT OF THE GUNS.

480
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
>> DON'T TELL THAT TO REVEREND

481
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
PETER JOHNSON A STRONG ADVOCATE

482
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
OF GUN CONTROL HE SAYS KIDS AND

483
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
GUNS SENDS A WRONG MESSAGE.

484
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
>> WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT OUR

485
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
LOVE AFFAIR IN EYE LENS.

486
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
>> HE THINKS VIOLENCE WOULD

487
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
DECREASE IF THEY WERE HARDER TO

488
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
GET.
HE TOOK 22,000 GUNS DURING GUN

489
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
BUY BACKS.

490
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
>> WE AREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO

491
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
TAKE GUNS OUT OF AMERICA'S HANDS

492
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
BUT I THINK WE MUST BEGIN TO

493
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
TALK TO AMERICA ABOUT VIOLENCE

494
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
ITSELF.

495
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
>> THE OWNERS OF THE GUN RANGE

496
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
SAY THEY DON'T ADVOCATE

497
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
VIOLENCE.

498
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
THE NUMEROUS GUN SAFETY CLASSES.

499
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE

500
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
OPENED THE RANGE WAS TO EDUCATE

501
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
CHILDREN TO TRAIN THEM IN THE

502
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
CORRECT WAY TO USE THEM.

503
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
IT CAN BE A FUN SUPPORT DOESN'T

504
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
HAVE TO BE DANGEROUS.

505
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
>> THE PROBLEM IS THE PERSON

506
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
BEHIND THE GUN NOT THE WEAPON

507
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
ITSELF.
>>> IF PEOPLE WANT TO HURT

508
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
ANOTHER PERSON THEY CAN USE A

509
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
BASEBALL BAT.

510
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
>> THE DIFFERENCE IS A BASEBALL

511
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
BAT IS FOR HITTING THE BASEBALL.

512
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
A GUN IS FOR KILLING PEOPLE.

513
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
>> BOTH SIDES DIFFER ON WHAT

514
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
NEEDS TO BE DONE BOTH SAY THEY

515
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
ARE UNITED IN PAIN AND ANGER

516
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN

517
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
CONNECTICUT AND BOTH BELIEVE

518
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE SO NO

519
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
MORE INNOCENT PEOPLE DIE IN

520
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
SCHOOLS.
>>> REBECCA LOW HIS REPORTING.
