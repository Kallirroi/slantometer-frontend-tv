1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
MIND THAT THE OVERWHELMING

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
MAJORITY OF OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
UNIFORM ABIDE BY THE HIGHEST

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
STANDARDS.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE THAT,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
YOU KNOW, THAT ENGAGE IN THE

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
WRONG KIND OF BEHAVIOR, THAT DO

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
THINGS THAT ABUSE THE SYSTEM,

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE NOT ONLY

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
TO PROSECUTE AND TO PUNISH THOSE

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
THAT DO THAT, BUT TO MAKE SURE

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
THAT WE'RE TAKING STEPS TO

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABIDING BY
THE HIGHEST STANDARDS, AND

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.
>> YOU'LL HEAR MORE FROM DEFENSE

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
SECRETARY LEON PANETTA TOMORROW

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
HE IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT IRAN
AND THE SEQUESTER CUTS.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
"PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT" STARTS

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
NOW.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
>>> TONIGHT, TEAM OBAMA TAKES A

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
BIG HIT.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
SUSAN RICE DROPS OUT OF THE
RUNNING FOR SECRETARY OF STATE

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
AFTER A BRUISING BATTLE WITH

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
CRITICS LIKE JOHN McCAIN.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
>> SHE NOT ONLY GAVE WRONG

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
INFORMATION, BUT SHE GAVE THE
PARTY LINE.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
>> NOW IS JOHN KERRY A LOCK FOR

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
STATE?
>>> AND THE OTHER BIG LATE STORY

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
IN WASHINGTON, SPEAKER BOEHNER

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
GOES TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
HOW CLOSE ARE THEY NOW TO A

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
DEAL?

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
RUDOLPH GIULIANI IS HERE TO SAY
A LOT ABOUT THESE THINGS.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'LL ASK HIM IF AMERICA IS

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
GETTING MORE DANGEROUS IN THE
WAKE SOME OF VERY SHOCKING

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
HIGH-PROFILE GUN CRIME.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
>>> HE WAS KNOWN AS ONE OF THE
WEST MEMPHIS THREE NOW DAMIEN

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
ECHOLS IS ADJUSTING TO LIFE AS A

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
FREE MAN.
>> I WAS IN A STATE OF EXTREME

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
SHOCK AND TRAUMA.
>> AND HOW HE SURVIVED 18 YEARS

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
ON DEATH ROW.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
>> IT'S ABSOLUTELY NIGHTMARISH.
>> THIS IS "PIERS MORGAN

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
TONIGHT."
>>> GOOD EVENING, YOU'RE LOOKING

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS HAD ONE OF
THOSE WIN SOME, LOSE SOME KIND

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
OF DAYS.

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
THE PRESIDENT AND JOHN BOEHNER
MET FOR 50 MINUTES IN A MEETING

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
BEING CALLED FRANK.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
WHEN BASICALLY TRANSLATES TO NO
DEAL YET.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
BUT THE GOOD NEWS WAS, QUOTE,
THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
REMAIN OPEN.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
THE BAD NEWS, AMBASSADOR SUSAN
RICE WAS WITHDRAWING FROM THE

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
SHORT LIST TO REPLACE HILLARY

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
CLINTON AS SECRETARY OF STATE.
>> I WITHDREW MY NAME BECAUSE I

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
THE COUNTRY AND I THINK IT'S THE

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
RIGHT THING FOR THE PRESIDENT.
PUTTING THOSE THINGS TOGETHER,

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
THAT MAKES IT THE RIGHT THING

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
FOR ME AND MY FAMILY.

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
>> RUDOLPH GIULIANI.
YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY VOCAL ABOUT

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
SUSAN RICE.

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
WERE YOU SURPRISED IN THE END
THAT SHE FELL ON HER SWORD

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
TODAY?

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
>> NOT AT ALL.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
IN FACT I DON'T SEE THAT AS BAD

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
NEWS FOR THE PRESIDENT.

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I SEE THAT AS GOOD NEWS FOR THE
PRESIDENT, BECAUSE A BATTLE TO

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
GET HER CONFIRMED WOULD HAVE

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
OFFERED THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
TO OPEN UP THIS WHOLE BENGHAZI
THING, WHERE NO ANSWERS HAVE YET

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
BEEN GIVEN.
>> YOU WERE ON TELEVISION WITH

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
HER.
>> I WAS, I WAS.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
>> ON THAT FATEFUL MORNING.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
>> I WAS ON THE CANDY CROWLEY

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
SHOW WHEN SHE APPEARED, RIGHT

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
HERE IN THIS BUILDING.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
WATCHED IT, HAD MY LITTLE PAD IN
FRONT OF ME.

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
WHEN SHE SAID IT -- HONESTLY,

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
WHEN SHE SAID IT, I UTTERED AN
EXPRESSION THAT I CAN'T SAY ON

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
TELEVISION.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
IT STARTS WITH A B.
BULL --
>> YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE IT?

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
>> I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT BECAUSE

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
HERE YOU HAD AN ATTACK WITH

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
ROCKET-PROPELLED HAND GRENADES,
MORTARS, VERY WELL EXECUTED,

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
VERY WELL PREPARED.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE MORE

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
SENSITIVE TO IT BECAUSE IT WAS
ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
11th, I HAD JUST COME FROM A

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
DINNER WITH ALL THE PEOPLE THAT
SURVIVED SEPTEMBER 11th WITH ME.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I SAID IS THIS WOMAN OUT OF HER

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
MIND?
WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT, A

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
SPONTANEOUS ATTACK?
DID SOMEBODY GIVE HER THAT?

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
AND THIS IDEA THAT SHE JUST READ

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
THE NOTES.
DON'T YOU EXERCISE SOME

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THIS?
>> IN AN OP-ED PIECE IN THE

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
"WASHINGTON POST" SHE SAYS THESE

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
UNCLASSIFIED POINTS SHE RECEIVED

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE
CLASSIFIED ASSESSMENTS I

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
RECEIVED AS A SENIOR POLICY
MAKER.

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I HAVE NEVER SOUGHT IN ANY WAY,
SHAPE OR FORM TO MISLEAD THE

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
AMERICAN PUBLIC.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
TO DO SO WOULD RUN COUNTER TO MY
CHARACTER AND MY LIFE OF PUBLIC

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
SERVICE.
IN RECENT WEEKS, NEW LINES OF

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
ATTACK HAVE BEEN RAISED TO

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
MALIGN MY CHARACTER AND MY
CAREER.

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
WITH ALL THE GENERAL PETRAEUS

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
CONFUSION, THERE WAS AN
IMPLICATION THAT PERHAPS SHE HAD

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
WITHHELD CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
FOR NATIONAL SECURITY REASONS,
WHICH WAS THE BIT THAT HAD

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
LINKED TO POSSIBLE AL QAEDA

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
INVOLVEMENT.
SHE'S MAKING IT PRETTY CLEAR,

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THOUGH, THAT ALL THE
INTELLIGENCE SHE RECEIVED,

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
CLASSIFIED OR UNCLASSIFIED, WAS

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
CONSISTENT.
THEREFORE, WE HAVE TO ASSUME DID

116
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
NOT SAY THIS IS LIKELY TO HAVE

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
BEEN AN AL QAEDA-RELATED ATTACK.
>> AND SHE DEMONSTRATED SHE'S AN

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
READER OF NOTES AND NOT AN

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
ANALYZER OF EVENTS.
>> WHAT WAS HER JOB THAT DAY,

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
RUDY, TO BE FAIR?
>> COMMON SENSE.

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
THEY GAVE HER A STORY THAT

122
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
DIDN'T MEET THE SMELL TEST.
A STRONG PERSON SAYS GARBAGE,

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT IT.

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'M SORRY.
I HAVE DONE THAT.

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO
ME.

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE THAT THIS
WAS A SPONTANEOUS ATTACK.

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS
TREMENDOUS PRESSURE TO TRY TO

128
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
SAY THIS WAS A SPONTANEOUS

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
ATTACK, TRY TO LINK IT TO THAT

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
MOHAMMED MOVIE THAT PRESIDENT

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
OBAMA TRIED TO LINK IT TO FOR
THE NEXT TWO WEEKS.

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
>> DO YOU THINK SHE LIED?

133
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT.

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
FOR ME SHE'S UNQUALIFIED TO BE
SECRETARY OF STATE BECAUSE SHE

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT TO MAKE

137
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
ANALYSIS LIKE THESE TALKING
POINTS DON'T MAKE SENSE.

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID AFTER

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
THE RESIGNATION CAME IN, I
DEEPLY REGRET THE UNFAIR AND

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
MISLEADING ATTACKS ON SUSAN RICE

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
IN RECENT WEEKS.
THE OTHER THING I'VE BEEN

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
HEARING TODAY FROM MANY PEOPLE

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
IN WASHINGTON IS, LOOK, YES, THE
BENGHAZI THING WAS PROBABLY PART

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
OF THIS, BUT ACTUALLY WHAT

145
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
WORSENED HER CASE REALLY WAS

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
WHEN SHE WENT TO TRY AND HAVE IT
OUT WITH SENATORS McCAIN AND THE

147
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
OTHERS AND REALLY CAME OFF

148
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
SECOND BEST AGAIN.
SHE GOT LED DOWN A GARDEN PATH

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
AND CAME OUT WITH THORNS

150
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
EVERYWHERE.
AND PEOPLE WERE SAYING, YOU

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
KNOW, SHE'S JUST A BIT
INEXPERIENCED TO DEAL WITH

152
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
BRUISES LIKE THIS.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR HER ON

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
THE WORLD STAGE.

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
IS THAT A FAIR CRITICISM?
>> ALSO FAIR.

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
WAS SHE IN ABOVE HER HEAD?
QUITE POSSIBLE.

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
MAYBE SHE WAS IN ABOVE HER HEAD
AND NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING HOW

157
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
TO ANALYZE INTELLIGENCE WELL

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
ENOUGH.
NOT HAVING ENOUGH INDEPENDENT

159
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
KNOWLEDGE TO APPLY TO IT TO

160
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
REALIZE THIS IS A MISTAKE.
WHEN I HEARD IT, WHEN JOHN

161
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
McCAIN HEARD IT, WE IMMEDIATELY

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
KNEW IT WAS A STORY THAT JUST
DIDN'T FLY.

163
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
MAYBE BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT MORE
EXPERIENCE THAN SHE DOES.

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
>> I INTERVIEWED JOHN McCAIN AND

165
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
LINDSEY GRAHAM THIS WEEK WHO

166
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
BOTH SAID THIS.
WATCH THIS.
>> THE FACT IS SHE NOT ONLY GAVE

167
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
WRONG INFORMATION, BUT SHE GAVE

168
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
THE PARTY LINE THAT, FOR

169
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
EXAMPLE, THAT AL QAEDA IS

170
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
DECIMATED.
AL QAEDA IS NOT DECIMATED.

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
THAT OUR EMBASSIES AND

172
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
CONSULATES ARE SECURE.
THEY ARE NOT SECURE.

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
SO EVERYBODY -- WE ARE ALL
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WE SAY.

174
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
SO WE'LL GO THROUGH THE PROCESS,

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
IF SHE IS NOMINATED, AND WE'LL
SEE.

176
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
>> I THINK THE INTELLIGENCE WAS
SANITIZED OR CREATED A FALSE

177
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
NARRATIVE.

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE WHERE.
>> WOULD YOU OBJECT TO HER

179
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
BECOMING SECRETARY OF STATE

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
PERSONALLY?
>> PERSONALLY I DON'T BELIEVE

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
SHE WOULD SERVE THE COUNTRY WELL
IN THAT CAPACITY.

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
>> WE'RE WILLING TO GIVE HER THE

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
NOMINATION PROCESS, BUT SHE'S
GOT A LOT TO PROVE.

184
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
>> I MEAN CRITICS ARE SAYING,

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
LOOK, SHE'S BASICALLY BEEN
STITCHED UP HERE BY A LOT OF

186
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
OLDER GUYS IN THE REPUBLICAN

187
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
PARTY WHO HAVE LOOKED AT A
BRIGHT YOUNG WOMAN AND THOUGHT

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU OUT OF

189
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
HERE.
>> A BRIGHT YOUNG WOMAN WOULDN'T

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
HAVE MADE THAT STATEMENT.
I BRIGHT YOUNG WOMAN WOULD HAVE

191
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
HAD ENOUGH INDEPENDENT

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
KNOWLEDGE, ENOUGH INDEPENDENT
JUDGMENT TO REALIZE SHE WAS

193
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
BEING FED A LOAD OF MULARKEY.

194
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
IN THE WORDS OF OUR VICE
PRESIDENT.

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
>> SHE'S CLEARLY BRIGHT, RUDY.
SHE'S NOT A STUPID WOMAN.

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
SHE'S A VERY INTELLIGENT WOMAN.

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
>> OBVIOUSLY NOT WITH ENOUGH

198
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
INFORMATION, NOT WITH ENOUGH
EXPERIENCE TO KNOW HOW TO

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
CRITICALLY ANALYZE INTELLIGENCE.

200
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
>> IF JOHN KERRY GETS THE JOB --
DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD, FIRST OF

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
ALL?
WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT?

202
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
>> WOULD I SUPPORT IT?

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
IF THE PRESIDENT WANTED JOHN
KERRY, I SEE NO REASON TO STAND

204
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
IN THE WAY OF JOHN KERRY AS

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
SECRETARY OF STAT
YES TS  AACPTLE

206
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
CHOICE.
>> LET'S MOVE TO THE FISCAL

207
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
CLIFF, BECAUSE IT'S BECOME A

208
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
REAL PAIN IN THE BACK SIDE FOR
EVERYBODY REALLY AND EVERYBODY

209
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
IS WAITING FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE

210
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
TO BE AN INEVITABLE DEAL.

211
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
IT WOULD SEEM TODAY THAT JOHN

212
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
BOEHNER AND PRESIDENT OBAMA MET

213
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
THAT'S A GOOD MOVE.

214
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
THEY HAVEN'T COME OUT ATTACKING

215
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
EACH OTHER, THAT'S ENCOURAGING.
ARE YOU LOOKING AT THIS AS A

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
PRE-CHRISTMAS DONE DEAL, RUDY?

217
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
>> I THINK SO, BECAUSE IT SEEMS

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
SO OBVIOUS THAT YOU HAVE TO DO
IT.

219
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I DIDN'T LIKE THE COMMENT THAT

220
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THEY HAD A FRANK TALK.

221
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
THAT REMINDS ME OF THE COLD WAR.

222
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
THAT'S WHEN KRUSCHEV AND KENNEDY

223
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
WOULD MEET AND THE NEXT THING
AFTER YOU SAID THEY HAD A FRANK

224
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
CONVERSATION, EVERYONE WENT INTO

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
SHELTERS AND SAID OH, MY GOD,
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT?

226
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
TO ME A DEAL IS DOABLE, BUT

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
YOU'VE GOT -- YOU HAVE TO
RECOGNIZE WHAT BOTH SIDES --

228
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
OBVIOUSLY THE PRESIDENT NEEDS A

229
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
HIKE IN TAXES.

230
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
>> AND THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN,

231
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
ISN'T IT?
LET'S BE HONEST, THE REPUBLICANS

232
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
HAVE LOST THAT ARGUMENT.

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
THE ARGUMENT NOW CLEARLY IS

234
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
ABOUT HOW FAR ARE THE SPENDING

235
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
CUTS GOING TO GO.
>> NOT ONLY HOW FAR, ARE THEY

236
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
GOING TO HAPPEN.
REPUBLICANS DON'T BELIEVE HE'LL

237
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
DO SPENDING CUTS.

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
SO HERE'S MY PROPOSAL, SEE WHAT
IT'S WORTH.

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
REPUBLICANS AGREE, SPLIT THE
DIFFERENCE.

240
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
REPUBLICANS AGREE TO JUMP THE
RATE FROM 35 TO 37 AND OTHER

241
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
SIMILAR KINDS OF JUMPS.

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
DEMOCRATS AGREE TO A TRILLION
DOLLARS, TRILLION AND A HALF

243
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
DOLLARS IN SPENDING CUTS.

244
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
THE SPENDING CUTS AND THE TAX

245
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
INCREASES GO INTO EFFECT AT THE
SAME TIME.

246
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT REPUBLICANS
ARE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT.

247
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT WE'LL GIVE

248
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
THEM THE TAX INCREASES, THEY'LL
SAY, DON'T WORRY, AND THEN A

249
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
YEAR FROM NOW THEY'LL BE VERY,

250
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
VERY FEW SPENDING DECREASES.

251
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
SO IF YOU COULD LINK THE TWO
THINGS TOGETHER AND SAY, OKAY,

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
WE CAN'T GET ALL THE SPENDING

253
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
REDUCTIONS DONE RIGHT NOW.
WE'LL AGREE ON A TAX INCREASE OF

254
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
A CERTAIN AMOUNT.

255
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
WE'LL AGREE ON SPENDING
DECREASES FOR REAL.

256
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
THEY GO INTO EFFECT JUNE 30th.
JUNE 30th BOTH THINGS HAPPEN.

257
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I DON'T SEE REPUBLICANS AGREEING

258
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
TO A TAX INCREASE WITHOUT
GETTING THEIR SPENDING CUTS KIND

259
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
OF LOCKED IN STONE.

260
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
>> I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY VERY
SENSIBLE AND I THINK THE REAL

261
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
BATTLE WILL COME WITH THE DEBT

262
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
CEILING GETS KICKED INTO THE

263
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
ORBIT OF WASHINGTON COME
JANUARY, FEBRUARY.

264
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE REALLY
TASTY DEBATE, I SUSPECT.

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
>> WELL, THE PRESIDENT UPPED THE

266
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
ANTE BY SAYING HE WANTED SORT OF

267
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
pTE  INEYO. ALLY AY TO RAISE TH3

268
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
LOOK AT THE MURDER THAT TOOK
PLACE IN NORWAY OR IN FINLAND

269
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
WHERE, WHAT, 79 PEOPLE WERE

270
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
KILLED WITHOUT A GUN.
SO THE REALITY -- THE REALITY IS

271
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A SENSIBLE

272
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
DEBATE ABOUT WEAPONS LIKE THIS,

273
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT HOW CAN

274
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
WE PUT SOME RESTRICTIONS ON
THEM, HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE

275
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
THEY'RE IN THE HANDS OF THE

276
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
RIGHT PEOPLE.
BUT PLEASE DON'T USE IT AS A WAY

277
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
OF NOT DEALING WITH WHAT'S

278
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
REALLY GOING ON, WHICH THESE

279
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
PEOPLE ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.
I THINK A LOT OF ANY INCREASE WE

280
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
SEE IN CRIME DOESN'T COME FROM

281
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
GUNS, IT COMES FROM A LACK OF

282
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
RESPONSIBILITY IN SOCIETY.
>> I KEEP HEARING IT'S NOT THE

283
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
GUNS, IT'S ITS PEOPLE.

284
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
THAT'S FINE, BUT THIS CHARACTER,

285
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
22 YEARS OLD, SEEMED PERFECTLY

286
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
NORMAL TO EVERYBODY WHO KNEW

287
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
HIM.
FAMILY, FRIENDS, SCHOOL

288
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
COLLEAGUES, WHATEVER.
EVERYONE WHO HAD EVER KNOWN THIS

289
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
GUY SAID MR. NORMAL.

290
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
NOT A CLUE THAT HE WOULD EVER DO
THIS, AND YET HE GOES INTO A

291
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
SHOPPING MALL AND BEGINS

292
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
SHOOTING PEOPLE IN WHAT WAS A
VERY SIMILAR IN, MY VIEW, KIND

293
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
OF THING THAT WE SAW IN AURORA.

294
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
MAYBE A COPY CAT, CRY FOR

295
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
ATTENTION, WHATEVER IT IS.
YOU CAN'T LEGISLATE FOR THAT.

296
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
ALL YOU CAN DO IS TRY TO REMOVE

297
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
THAT GUY'S ABILITY TO FIND AN
AR-15.

298
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
OR STEAL ONE, AS HE DID.
>> AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

299
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
REMOVE IT, THOUGH.
>> WHY NOT?

300
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
>> IF HE DOESN'T GET THE AR-15,

301
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
HE'LL GO GET A HANDGUN.
IF HE DOESN'T DO THAT, HE'LL GO

302
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
GET EXPLOSIVES.
IF HE DOESN'T GET THAT, HE'LL GO

303
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
GET POISON.

304
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
>> BUT DON'T YOU HAVE TO TRY
WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING A COUNTRY

305
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
WITH SO MANY GUNS TO TRY TO MAKE

306
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
IT HARDER?

307
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000

KELLY HAVE MET THAT RECORD, I'M

313
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
NOT SURE.
BUT I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO

314
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
REALLY SEIZE GUNS.
I BELIEVE IN IT.

315
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I BELIEVE IN GETTING THEM OUT OF

ENDS CRIME.

320
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS MUCH MORE
IMPORTANT.

IF YOU WANT TO DO A FACTOR, 75%

IS HUMAN BEHAVIOR, 25% IS THE

324
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
THAT IT WAS THE BEST THING FOR

325
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
OUR COUNTRY, FOR THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE THAT I NOT CONTINUE TO BE

CONSIDERED BY THE PRESIDENT FOR

NOMINATION AS SECRETARY OF STATE

328
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE A
CONFIRMATION PROCESS THAT WAS

329
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
VERY PROLONGED, VERY

ARE THEY RIGHT TO BE PLEASED
ABOUT THIS?

345
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
>> I DON'T KNOW FOR THEM IF IT'S

346
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
AS MUCH PERSONALLY ABOUT HER OR

347
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
IF IT'S ABOUT BENGHAZI.

348
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
ALL THREE OF THEM DID

349
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
IMMEDIATELY TODAY MAKE

350
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
STATEMENTS SAYING WE WILL NOT
STOP THE SCRUTINY ON BENGHAZI

351
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
AND WHAT HER WITHDRAWAL DOES IS

352
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
STOP THE SCRUTINY OR THE

353
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
HEADLINES OF BENGHAZI.
>> THERE'S A FEAR THAT SHE'S

354
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
BASICALLY FALLEN ON HER SWORD

355
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO

356
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
BE A RESIGNATION LINKED TO
BENGHAZI AT SOME STAGE.

357
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
>> IT CERTAINLY WON'T BE HER.

358
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
BUT REMEMBER THE FOUNDATION
REALLY STARTED TO CRUMBLE ON

359
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
THIS WHEN THE LEFT STOPPED

360
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
SUPPORTING SUSAN RICE.
SO AS MUCH AS THE THREE AMIGOS

361
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
WERE OUT IN FRONT, MAUREEN DOWD

362
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
HAD CRITICAL, CRITICAL REVIEWS
OF HER, EZRA KLEIN, THE

363
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
ENVIRONMENTALIST MOVEMENT

364
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS WITH
HER.

365
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
>> THAT IS TRUE AND I DETECTED
THAT.

366
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
THERE WAS ALSO A SENSE WHEN SHE
WENT UP THERE TO SEE THE THREE

367
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
AMIGOS AND OTHERS, SHE REALLY

368
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
EMERGED LOOKING QUITE WEAKENED
AS IF SHE GOT INTO AN OBVIOUS

369
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
TRAP AND BEEN LASSOED ALL OVER

370
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
AGAIN.

371
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
IT JUST DIDN'T LOOK VERY SMART

372
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
POLITICS BY HER.

373
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
>> WELL, NO, I THINK SHE TOOK

374
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
ONE FOR THE TEAM.

375
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE ENTIRE

376
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
SITUATION HAS BECOME HIGHLY
POLITICIZED.

377
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
FRANKLY GIULIANI SAYING SHE MAY
NOT HAVE BEEN SHARP ENOUGH IS

378
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
WHOLLY UNFAIR AND I THINK IT

379
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
REALLY IS A TRAGEDY, BECAUSE SHE

380
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
REALLY, I WOULD SAY, IS THE BEST

381
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
WOMAN FOR THE JOB.

382
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
SHE WAS A TRUSTED ADVISER TO THE

383
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
PRESIDENT AND SHE HAS DONE MORE

384
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
IN TERMS OF PUTTING SANCTIONS

385
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
AGAINST IRAN, NORTH KOREA IN HER

386
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
CAPACITY AS AMBASSADOR.
IS TRULY A WOMAN WHO UNDERSTANDS

387
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
21st CENTURY DIPLOMACY AND

388
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
NATIONAL SECURITY.
AND WHAT SHE DID WAS GO AND READ

389
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
TALKING POINTS GIVEN TO HER BY

390
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
THE NATIONAL SECURITY STAFF AND

391
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
DID HER JOB.
HAD SHE GONE IN AND ASSERTED HER

392
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
OWN OPINIONS, HER OWN -- IT

393
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AS PLAYING

394
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
POLITICS, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN

395
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
OUT OF PLACE.

396
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
>> OKAY.

397
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
BUT MARGARET, WHETHER SHE'S THE

398
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB I THINK

399
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
IS A FAIRLY ARGUABLE POINT.

400
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I DON'T THINK SHE'S BEEN

401
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
MASSIVELY IMPRESSIVE IN THE LAST

402
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
FEW MONTHS.
SHE MISLED THE PUBLIC

403
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
DELIBERATELY BUT NOT MASSIVELY

404
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
IMPRESSIVE.
JOHN KERRY, I WOULD SAY, IS

405
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
PROBABLY A BETTER CANDIDATE,
JUST FROM MY DISPASSIONATE EYE.

406
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
>> HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE

407
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
MADE THE SAME MISTAKE SHE MADE.

408
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I THINK SENATOR CLINTON PROBABLY
SAID IT BEST WHEN SHE ACTUALLY

409
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
MADE EVERY INDICATION THAT SHE

410
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
FAVORS JOHN KERRY FOR THE
POSITION, NOT SECRETARY RICE.

411
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
HE IS WIDELY RESPECTED IN

412
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
WASHINGTON, WHETHER YOU LIKE
HIS -- HE'S BEEN HEAD OF THE

413
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE FOR

414
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS SO HE

415
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
PROBABLY DOES HAVE MORE
EXPERIENCE.

416
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
NOT TO KNOCK SUSAN RICE'S

417
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY.

418
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT SENATOR

419
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
McCAIN WILL BE THRILLED WITH THE
FOREIGN POLICY THAT JOHN KERRY

420
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
RUNS ANY BETTER THAN SUSAN RICE.

421
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
IT WAS THE HANDLING OF THIS AND
THE HANDLING OF THE

422
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
ADMINISTRATION WITH BENGHAZI
THAT THIS BECAME THE SYMBOL OF.

423
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
>> LET'S MOVE TO THIS RATHER

424
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
DIFFICULT SITUATION THE
PRESIDENT FINDS HIMSELF IN WITH

425
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
THE TOP FOUR CABINET POSITIONS

426
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
COULD ALL BE FILLED BY MEN IT

427
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
NOW SEEMS, NO WOMEN AT ALL.
THAT'S NOT GREAT FOR A

428
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
PROGRESSIVE PRESIDENT LIKE

429
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
BARACK OBAMA, IS IT?
>> YEAH, NO.
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF GOOD

430
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THAT
PROSPECT.

431
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I THINK THE THING IS THERE IS I

432
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
DEEP ENOUGH BENCH OF FABULOUS
WOMEN THAT COULD FULFILL THESE

433
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
ROLES AND WE SURE WOULD LIKE TO

434
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
SEE THEM HOLD THOSE POSITIONS.
SUSAN RICE, I THINK IS NOT JUST

435
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
THE BEST WOMAN FOR THE JOB, I

436
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
THOUGHT SHE WAS THE BEST PERSON

437
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
FOR THE JOB.
IN TERMS OF JOHN KERRY BEING A

438
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
SAFE CHOICE, HE'S VANILLA AND

439
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
VANILLA IS ALWAYS A SAFE FLAVOR,

440
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
RIGHT?

441
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
BUT I WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY IT'S
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT IN

442
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
TERMS OF I THINK IT'S GOOD TO

443
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
HAVE THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE
JOB ALWAYS.

444
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH CHECKING

445
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
OUT THE PROSPECTS FOR SURE.
>>> LET'S TURN TO THE FISCAL

446
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
CLIFF, THE FRANK MEETING BETWEEN

447
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND JOHN
BOEHNER.

448
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I BELIEVE THEY JUST CALLED EACH
OTHER NAMES FOR 50 MINUTES AND

449
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
WALKED OUT WITH NO DEAL BEING

450
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
DONE.
BUT LOOK AT THE FOOTAGE FROM THE

451
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
UKRAINE PARLIAMENT.
JUST WHEN YOU THINK WASHINGTON

452
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
IS THE WORST IN THE WORLD AT

453
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
DOING THINGS TOGETHER, LOOK AT

454
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
THESE CLOWNS, THIS IS QUITE
AMAZING.

455
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
THIS IS THE UKRAINE PARLIAMENT
ERUPTING INTO OPEN PHYSICAL

456
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
WARFARE.
NOW, THERE IS A VIEW THAT A GOOD

457
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
OLD PUNCH-UP DOES TEND TO

458
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
RESOLVE THESE THINGS.
MAYBE JOHN BOEHNER AND BARACK

459
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
OBAMA SHOULD JUST SQUARE OFF,

460
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
GET IN A RING AND SLUG EACH
OTHER OUT.

461
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
>> THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
THIS THING HAPPENED.

462
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN THE

463
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
UKRAINE.
>> OR THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT.

464
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
IT'S FAR MORE INTERESTING AND
FAR MORE FUN WHEN YOU CAN THROW

465
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
A LITTLE HUMOR AND PUNCHES.

466
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
MAYBE THEY NEED TO GET IT OUT OF

467
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
THEIR SYSTEMS.
>> BUT BRITISH YOU HAVE

468
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
RHETORICAL PUNCHES.
>> ON A VAGUELY SERIOUS POINT

469
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
THOUGH, MARGARET HOOVER, LET ME

470
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
ASK MARGARET FIRST AND THEN YOU
MARJORIE, ARE WE GOING TO GET A

471
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
DEAL DONE BEFORE CHRISTMAS?

472
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
ALL THE HINTS I'M GETTING IS
YES, IT'S GOING TO BE A DEAL.

473
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
>> I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET A

474
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
DEAL AND I THINK THE QUESTION IS

475
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
E2%ILSETH A

476
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
HE CAN TAKE BACK TO HIS FAITHFUL

477
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
AND SAY I'VE GOT SOMETHING TOO.
>> I'M GOING TO START USING

478
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
GIPPER TOO.

479
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
YES, I THINK HE WILL GET HIS BIT
THERE, BUT I THINK HE WILL HAVE

480
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
TO GIVE, ABSOLUTELY.

481
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
IT'S GOING TO BE A COMPROMISE IN
THE END.

482
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
HONESTLY, THIS IS CLASSIC
NEGOTIATION 101.

483
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
>>> I DON'T BELIEVE IN LOTS OF
INHERITED WEALTH.

484
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I HAVEN'T BEEN SPENDING MY LIFE

485
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO
TRANSFER WEALTH AND NOT HAVE

486
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
TAXES AND ALL OF THAT SO THERE

487
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
CAN BE A DYNASTY OF ALL KINDS OF

488
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
LITTLE BUFFETS GOING AROUND FOR
HUNDREDS OF YEARS NEVER HAVING

489
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
TO DO ANYTHING.
>> THE RICHEST MAN IN AMERICA,

490
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
WARREN BUFFETT.

491
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
WITH ME IS ONE OF THE KIDS,
HOWARD G. BUFFET, PRESIDENT OF

492
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
THE HOWARD G. BUFFET FOUNDATION.

493
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
WELCOME TO YOU, SIR.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

494
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
>> YOU ARE THE MIDDLE CHILD OF

495
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
WARREN BUFFETT.

496
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
WHAT'S IT LIKE, I SPENT -- I

497
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
TOLD YOU IN THE BREAK I SPENT A

498
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
GREAT HOLIDAY ONCE READING THAT

499
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
BIOGRAPHY ABOUT YOUR FATHER AND

500
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
GOT TO KNOW ALL OF YOU

501
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
VICARIOUSLY THROUGH THIS BOOK.

502
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY RIVETING AND

503
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
COMPELLING.
WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE WARREN

504
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
BUFFETT'S SON?
>> WELL, FIRST, I'M AFRAID YOU

505
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
KNOW MORE ABOUT ME THAN I KNOW,

506
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
SO THAT'S MY FIRST CONCERN.

507
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK OF IT AS
BEING WARREN BUFFETT'S SON.

508
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
YOU KNOW, WE GREW UP, AS MANY

509
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
PEOPLE KNOW AND SOME PEOPLE
DON'T BELIEVE, IN A VERY MODEST

510
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
ENVIRONMENT.

511
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
AND I NEVER -- WE NEVER REALLY

512
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
WERE EVEN AWARE THAT MY DAD WAS

513
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
REALLY MAKING MONEY UNTIL
PROBABLY TOWARDS THE END OF

514
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
JUNIOR HIGH AND THEN INTO HIGH

515
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
SCHOOL.
AND THEN YOU'RE A LITTLE OLDER

516
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
AND YOU JUST TAKE IT AS IT
COMES.

517
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
BUT I'VE NEVER THOUGHT OF IT

518
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
THAT WAY.
>> WHAT I LOVE ARE THE LITTLE

519
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
TINY BITS OF TRIVIAL DETAIL

520
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.

521
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
THERE'S A GREAT STORY THAT YOU

522
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
TELL ABOUT YOU ASKED YOUR FATHER
IF YOU COULD HAVE A CAR.

523
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
AND IN EXCHANGE HE SAID, RIGHT,

524
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
YOU CAN.

525
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY BIRTHDAY

526
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
OR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS FOR SOME

527
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
INDETERMINANT PERIOD.

528
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
HOW LONG WAS THE PERIOD?

529
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
>> THREE YEARS.
AND I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO GIVE

530
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
ME $5,000 AND I THOUGHT I COULD

531
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
GET THE CAR FOR $5,000 AND I WAS

532
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
$2500 SHORT.
THAT WAS A LOT OF MONEY.

533
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
>> HOW DID YOU FEEL?

534
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
DIDDY EVER NEARLY SUCCUMB TO THE
PRESSURE?

535
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
>> OH, NO, IT WAS A DEAL.
IN OUR HOUSEHOLD A DEAL IS A

536
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
DEAL.
>> WAS THERE A HANDSHAKE OR

537
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
FORMAL CONTRACT?

538
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
>> NO, THE HANDSHAKE WAS IT.

539
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
>> HAS YOUR DAD ALWAYS BEEN A
HANDSHAKE MAN?

540
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
HE'S MADE SOME OF THE BIGGEST

541
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
DEALS ANY BUSINESSMAN HAS EVER

542
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
MADE ON A HANDSHAKE.
>> AND YOU THE SAME?

543
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I MEAN IF YOU DON'T TRUST WHO

544
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
YOU'RE DOING A DEAL WITH, THEN
YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING A DEAL.

545
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
A CONTRACT DOESN'T MAKE A BAD

546
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
GUY DO A GOOD DEAL.
SO YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT ON A

547
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
HANDSHAKE.
>> THE OTHER STORY I ABSOLUTELY

548
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
LOVED WAS AS A KID YOU TURNED

549
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
YOUR BACK YARD INTO A FARM AND

550
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
THAT'S BECOME YOUR GREAT PASSION
OR LOVE.

551
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
YOUR FATHER LATER BOUGHT LAND
FOR YOU AND CHARGED YOU RENT,

552
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
BUT THIS WAS THE TWIST.

553
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
HE TIED IT TO THE AMOUNT OF YOUR
BODY WEIGHT.

554
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
THE HIGHER YOUR WEIGHT, THE

555
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
HIGHER THE RENT.
DID IT WORK?
THIS COULD BE THE GREATEST DIET

556
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
THING IN HISTORY.

557
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
>> IT DIDN'T WORK.
AND HE WOULD TELL YOU IT DIDN'T

558
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
WORK.
YOU KNOW, SO WE MOVED ON TO THE

559
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
NEXT THING.
>> WHAT DID WORK OVER THE YEARS?

560
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
>> WELL, I THINK THE THINGS THAT

561
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
HAVE WORKED, I'M NOT SURE
EXACTLY SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOU'RE

562
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
AFTER.
>> WELL, HE MUST HAVE IMPARTED

563
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
SO MUCH WISDOM TO YOU OVER THE

564
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
YEARS.
>> HE HAS BEEN AN AMAZING

565
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
MENTOR.
I USED TO SIT -- I'M NOT SURE HE

566
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
EVEN KNOWS I DID THIS.

567
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
BUT I USED TO SIT IN A CHAIR OR
ON THE COUCH OR SOMETHING IN THE

568
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
SAME ROOM.
HE'S BE ON THE PHONE NEGOTIATING

569
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
SOMETHING AND I'D JUST LISTEN TO

570
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
HIM.

571
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'D ONLY HEAR ONE SIDE OF THE

572
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
CONVERSATION, BUT THAT WAS
ENOUGH TO GET A GOOD IDEA OF

573
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
WHAT HE WAS DOING OF THE AND I
MEAN IT WAS AN AMAZING

574
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
EXPERIENCE.
>> YOU HAVE THIS FOUNDATION

575
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
INVOLVED VERY MUCH WITH HUNGER

576
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
AND CHARITY WORK, YOU VISITED

577
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
THE CONGO WITH BEN AFFLECK.
OBVIOUSLY A PASSION OF YOURS.

578
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
>> WELL, I JUST GOT BACK FROM

579
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
EASTERN CONGO ABOUT FOUR DAYS
AGO, THE SECOND TRIP IN FIVE

580
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
WEEKS.

581
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
CONGO IS AN AREA WHERE A LOT OF

582
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE DEBATE
WRONG.

583
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I WILL TELL YOU, YOU'VE BEEN

584
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
TALKING ALL ABOUT SUSAN RICE AND

585
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I DON'T KNOW THE POLITICS OF

586
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
SUSAN RICE.

587
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
SHE MADE A STATEMENT WHICH IS

588
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
DEAD RIGHT, WHICH IS IF IT ISN'T
THEM IN 23, IT WILL BE THEM.

589
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
SINCE 1990 IT HAS NOT MOVED AND

590
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
STILL HAS REMAINED AT THE BOTTOM

591
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
OF THE U.N. INDEX FOR POVERTY

592
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
AND HUMAN SUFFERING.
SO -- AND IT RANKS ALMOST DEAD

593
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
LAST AND MO ABRAMS INDEX NEXT TO

594
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
SOMALIA.
I WAS IN SOMALIA ABOUT FIVE

595
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
WEEKS AGO.
I TELL YOU, I CAN UNDERSTAND

596
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
THAT.
SO IT'S A TOUGH PLACE, IT'S A

597
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
TOUGH -- IT'S FULL OF ATROCITIES
AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.

598
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
AND SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO SUPPORT

599
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
THE GOVERNMENT OF DRC TO DO A

600
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
BETTER JOB AND TO TAKE EASTERN
CONGO AND TURN IT -- IT HAS

601
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
INCREDIBLE MINERAL -- SOME OF

602
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
THE ESTIMATES ARE $24 TRILLION
OF WEALTH TO BRING OUT IN THE

603
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
FUTURE.
IT COULD BE A VERY RICH COUNTRY.

604
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
>> LET'S TALK BRIEFLY THE FISCAL

605
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
CLIFF.
YOUR FATHER HAS BEEN VERY VOCAL

606
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
ABOUT TAXES.
HE SAYS COME ON, BRING IT TO ME,

607
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
TAX ME MORE.
OBVIOUSLY YOU'LL BE IN THE

608
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
FIRING LINE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A

609
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
POOR MAN, ARE YOU.

610
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
ARE YOU HAPPY YOUR FATHER IS

611
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
LEADING THIS CALL FOR YOU TO

612
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
GET --
>> NO, BECAUSE I HEAR FROM ALL

613
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS WHO DON'T

614
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
LIKE IT.
YOU KNOW, THE FISCAL CLIFF, YOU

615
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
TALK ABOUT IT, IT'S LIKE -- YOU

616
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
KNOW, IT'S THE RESULT OF POOR

617
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
BEHAVIOR.

618
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED.

619
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
YOU KNOW, ON THE OTHER HAND THE
WORLD DOESN'T END TOMORROW IF WE

620
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
GO OFF THE CLIFF.

621
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
COKE SELLS COCA-COLA, BURLINGTON
NORTHERN HAULS FREIGHT.

622
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I WILL TELL YOU, I THINK OF THE

623
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
FISCAL CLIFF A LITTLE
DIFFERENTLY.

624
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I PUT IT -- I THINK IT'S
RELATIVE TO THE WORLD.

625
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
EVERYBODY IN THE EASTERN CONGO

626
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
GETS UP AND THEY'RE FALLING OFF
THE FISCAL CLIFF EVERY MORNING

627
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
WHEN THEY GET OUT OF BED TRYING

628
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY CAN FEED

629
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
THEIR CHILD LIVING ON $1 A DAY
OR HALF A DOLLAR A DAY.

630
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
SO I THINK IT'S ALL RELATIVE.

631
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
AND THE WORLD DOESN'T END.
AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT GOING

632
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
OFF THE CLIFF ISN'T THE SLAP IN

633
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
THE FACE WE NEED TO SAY, FOLKS,
WE NEED TO DO BETTER.

634
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
>> WOULD YOU BE HAPPY TO PAY

635
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
MORE TAX?

636
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
>> I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO PAY

637
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
MORE TAX.
I TELL YOU WHAT I THINK IT

638
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
AMOUNTS TO.

639
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
WHEN MY DAD STARTED TALKING
ABOUT THIS I STARTED PAYING

640
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
ATTENTION TO WHAT TAX I PAID.

641
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'M IN THE 35% TAX BRACKET.

642
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
BUT I WENT BACK AND FIGURED IT
OUT -- I SHOULD SAY MY WIFE WENT

643
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
BACK AND FIGURED IT OUT, SHE DID

644
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
>> THANKS FOR HAVING US.

645
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
>> YES.
>> HOW DIFFICULT HAS IT BEEN FOR

646
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
YOU, DAMIEN?
>> IT WAS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.

647
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
YOU KNOW, I REALLY DIDN'T EVEN

648
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
HAVE AN IDEA HOW DIFFICULT IT

649
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
WAS GOING TO BE.
FOR THE FIRST AT LEAST THREE

650
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
MONTHS THAT I WAS OUT, I WAS IN
A STATE OF EXTREME SHOCK AND

651
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
TRAUMA.
I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING BY MYSELF

652
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
OR FOR MYSELF.

653
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I NEEDED SOMEONE WITH ME
CONSTANTLY.

654
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I JUST -- IT WAS LIKE A COMPLETE
AND ABSOLUTE SHOCK TO THE

655
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
SYSTEM.

656
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
>> WHAT ARE THE PHYSICAL SIDE

657
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
EFFECTS THAT YOU STILL -- YOU'RE

658
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
WEARING DARK GLASSES.

659
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
CLEARLY YOU STILL HAVE
SENSITIVITY FOR YOUR EYES, NOT

660
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
HAVING NATURAL SUNLIGHT FOR

661
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
YEARS.

662
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
>> YEAH.

663
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
>> WHAT ELSE?

664
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
>> I'VE GAINED 60 POUNDS BECAUSE

665
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I HAVE ADEQUATE NUTRITION AND

666
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
DECENT EXERCISE, THINGS LIKE
THAT.

667
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I STILL HAVE A LOT OF KIDNEY

668
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
ISSUES BECAUSE I WAS BEATEN

669
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
PRETTY BAD AT ONE POINT.

670
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF DENTAL

671
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
ISSUES, WHICH THANKFULLY I'VE

672
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
BEEN ABLE TO GET FIXED OVER THE

673
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
PAST YEAR, A LOT OF NERVE

674
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
DAMAGE, THINGS LIKE THAT.

675
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
>> LORI, WHAT'S IT BEEN LIKE TO

676
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
HAVE HIM IN NORMAL LIFE AND HOW

677
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
DO YOU THINK HE'S BEEN COPING?

678
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, IT'S AMAZING TO

679
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
HAVE HIM OUT HERE WITH US.

680
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
BUT IT'S TRUE, NO ONE COULD

681
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
FORESEE HOW HE WAS GOING TO

682
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
COPE.

683
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
AND SO IT WAS DIFFICULT.

684
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW HE

685
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
WAS FEELING AND THE ANXIETY AND

686
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
ALL OF THAT THAT HE WAS DEALING

687
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
WITH FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS.

688
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
AFTER THAT, IT'S JUST BEEN A

689
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
PROCESS.

690
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
BUT IT'S -- THERE'S NO

691
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
PRECEDENT.

692
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO PLACE,

693
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
THERE'S NO GUIDE BOOK OR

694
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
ANYTHING TO KNOW WHAT TO DO.

695
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK HAVE BEEN

696
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
THE HARDEST THINGS FOR DAMIEN TO
DEAL WITH?

697
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
>> IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS, LIKE

698
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
GOING TO THE BANK AND FILLING

699
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
OUT A DEPOSIT SLIP OR GOING

700
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
THROUGH SECURITY AT THE AIRPORT.

701
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
IT'S THE ANXIETY THAT I DIDN'T

702
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
UNDERSTAND IS JUST HUGE FOR HIM.

703
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
JUST THE DAY-TO-DAY LIFE.

704
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
>> IT'S QUITE AN EXTRAORDINARY

705
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
STORY.

706
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I WAS GRIPPED BY IT WHEN I DID

707
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
THE PREVIOUS INTERVIEW.
THIS SHOCKING MISCARRIAGE OF

708
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
JUSTICE FOR THESE MEN.

709
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
WHAT WAS IT THAT APPEALED TO YOU
FROM A DOCUMENTARY MAKER

710
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
POINTING OF VIEW?

711
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
>> WELL, THE STORY HAD SO MANY

712
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
TWISTS AND TURNS BUT AT THE END

713
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
OF THE DAY THERE WAS A MAN ON

714
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
DEATH ROW AND TWO SERVING LIFE
SENTENCES FOR SOMETHING THEY

715
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
DIDN'T DO.

716
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I THINK THE MOST GRIPPING THING

717
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
WAS THAT THEY WERE CONVICTED AS
IF THEY PERPETRATED THESE

718
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
SATANIC MURDERS.

719
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
ONCE WE DISCOVERED THAT SNAPPING

720
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
TURTLES ACTUALLY CAUSED THE

721
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
WOUNDS THAT WERE BEING JUDGED AS

722
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
KNIFE WOUNDS, THIS WAS A WHOLE

723
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
DIFFERENT MURDER CASE.

724
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
>> LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A CLIP

725
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
FROM THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT
PERTAINS EXACTLY TO WHAT YOU

726
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
JUST MENTIONED.

727
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
>> IF YOU ASK ME, THE SING IT
GREATEST OFFENSE COMMITTED IN

728
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
THIS CASE IS WHAT WAS DONE BY

729
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
JOHN WITH THE KNIFE AND THE LEG.

730
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
>> DIVERS SEARCHED A SMALL LAKE

731
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
AND THAT SEARCH PRODUCED A

732
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
KNIFE.

733
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
>> TO GO OUT THERE IN THIS BIG

734
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
POND AND TO GO RIGHT THERE AND

735
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
JUST LESS THAN 30 MINUTES AND
COME UP WITH THIS KNIFE, I MEAN,

736
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
YOU WIN THE LOTTERY.

737
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
>> WIN THE LOTTERY.
OF COURSE THE LOTTERY TURNED OUT

738
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
TO BE A SHAMEFUL FARCE, DIDN'T

739
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
IT?

740
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
>> AND WHAT YOU DIDN'T HEAR WAS

741
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
ACTUALLY THAT THAT KNIFE WAS

742
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
ACTUALLY THROWN IN THE LAKE A

743
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
YEAR BEFORE THE MURDERS EVEN

744
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
HAPPENED AND IT ACTUALLY WAS

745
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
USED IN THE TRIAL TO CONVICT

746
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
THESE GUYS.

747
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
SO IT WAS JUST SUCH A TRAGEDY IN

748
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
THE MAKING.

749
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
>> AND IN RELATION TO THE WOUNDS

750
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
TO THESE POOR BOYS, AND WE'LL

751
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
COME TO THE FACT THERE'S NEVER

752
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
BEEN ANYONE REALLY WHO ACTUALLY

753
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
DID THIS BROUGHT TO JUSTICE, THE

754
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS

755
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
DOCUMENTARY UNRAVELS IS THAT

756
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
THESE WOUNDS WERE MUCH MORE

757
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY

758
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
TURTLES THAN BY A KNIFE.

759
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

760
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
THERE WAS NO DEPTH TO THE

761
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
WOUNDS, THEY WERE SCRATCH MARKS.

762
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
BUT PEOPLE WERE PRESENTED WITH

763
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
THE INFORMATION AS IF THEY WERE

764
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
STABBED TO DEATH.

765
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
AND THERE WAS NO DEPTH.

766
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
THERE WAS NO ORGAN DAMAGE OR

767
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
ANYTHING.

768
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
>> THE DOCUMENTARY IS VERY

769
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
POWERFUL.

770
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
IT TALKS OF BEING THE FIRST

771
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
CROWD SOURCED INVESTIGATION
EVER, AND YOU WORKED WITH

772
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
INVESTIGATORS AND FORENSIC TEAMS
TO REVEAL FALSE CONFESSIONS,

773
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
JUNK SCIENCE AND THE

774
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT.

775
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
>> WELL, BECAUSE THIS WAS A
CLOSED CASE AND THEY WERE

776
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
CONVICTED, EVERYTHING BECAME

777
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
AVAILABLE ON THE PUBLIC RECORD

778
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
AND PEOPLE WERE FASCINATED WITH

779
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
THIS STORY FOR ALL DIFFERENT

780
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000

INTERNET BEGAN TO GET -- TO
BECOME WHAT IT IS TODAY.

785
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
AND SO PEOPLE WERE LIKE -- IF

786
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
THEY WERE TRYING THE CASE ONLINE

787
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
BASICALLY.

788
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
AND IT JUST BECAME THIS MASSIVE
CALL TO ACTION.

789
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
>> LET'S TAKE A SHORT BREAK.

790
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000

COURSE, YOU COULD HAVE BEEN

847
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
THERE PROBABLY THREE OTHERS.

848
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
ONE WAS EXECUTED, PROBABLY WILL

849
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
BE EXECUTED IN THE UPCOMING

850
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
YEAR.

851
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
ONE HAS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF

852
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
GETTING OUT DUE TO THE FACT THAT

853
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
THERE HAS BEEN A LITTLE MEDIA

854
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
INTEREST IN HIS CASE.

855
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
>> WHAT DNA EVIDENCE HAD IT BEEN
AROUND WHEN YOU WERE ARRESTED,

856
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
HAVE CLEARED YOU FROM THE START?
>> I DON'T KNOW.

857
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO CONVICT
US SO BADLY.

858
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
WE HAD OTHER THINGS LIKE ALIBIS,

859
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
PEOPLE THAT COULD TESTIFY TO

860
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
WHERE WE WERE AT THE TIME AND

861
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
CAN PLAINLY PROVE THAT WE

862
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
WEREN'T AT THE CRIME SCENE.

863
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
THEY SEEN HAVE JESSE MESCELLI

ABOUT HIM.

866
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
SO TECHNICALLY IT IS POSSIBLE

867
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
THAT THEY COULD HAVE SHOWED THEM

868
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
THE DNA AND THEY WERE SO ENRAGED

869
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
AT THE TIME THAT THEY WOULD HAVE

870
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
CONVICTED US ANYWAY.

871
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
>> HAVE YOU TATTOOS THAT YOU

872
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
DIDN'T HAVE LAST TIME.
WHAT DO ME MEAN?

873
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
>> IT HELPS ME DEAL.

874
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
IT IS VERY PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND

875
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
EMOTIONALLY SOOTHING TO ME.

876
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
IT IS ALSO LIKE PUTTING ON A

877
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
SUIT OF ARMOR.

878
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
LIKE IT GIVES YOU SOME SORT OF
LEVEL OF -- LIKE A BUFFER ZONE

879
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
BETWEEN YOU AND THE REST OF THE

880
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
WORLD.

881
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
>> WHAT ARE THE ONES ON YOUR
KNUCKLES?

882
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
>> THESE ARE RUINS.
USUALLY WHEN I GET TATTOOS I GET

883
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
SOMETHING MEANINGFUL TO ME.

884
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
LIKE I SAID, IT IS A SUIT OF

885
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
ARMOR SO I LOOK TO PUT ON A SUIT
OF ARMOR MADE OUT OF THINGS I

886
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
LOVE.

887
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
LIKE WINTER, SNOW, ARCH ANGEL
MICHAEL.

888
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
SOMETHING THAT MEANS SOMETHING

889
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
TO ME PERSONALLY.

890
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
>> DO YOU STAY IN TOUCH WITH
JASON AND JESSE?

891
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
>> JASON AND I, I HATE MORE THAN
ANYTHING TALKING ON THE PHONE.

892
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
BUT WE WILL TEXT.

893
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
JESSE, FROM WHAT I HEARD,

894
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
DOESN'T HAVE MUCH CONTACT WITH
ANYONE.

895
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
HE ONLY HAD A 68 IQ TO BEGIN

896
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
WITH AND THEN YOU DUMP ON THIS.

897
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
THEY MADE SURE HE WON'T LIVE

898
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
ANYTHING REMOTELY RESEMBLING A

899
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
NORMAL LIFE.

900
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
AND HE IS A SHUT-IN.

901
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
>> IT IS A HEART BREAKING STORY,

902
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
AS WELL AS SHOCKING STORY.

903
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
THESE ARE THREE LIVED VIRTUALLY

904
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
RUINS AND MAYBE IN JESSE'S CASE,

905
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
COMPLETELY RUINED.

906
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
>> I FELL LIKE WEST OF MEMPHIS

907
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
IS A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY AND I

908
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
FEEL LIKE WE HAD BEAUTIFUL

909
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO THE INSIDE

910
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
STORY OF THE INVESTIGATION AND

911
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
THE LOVE STORY AND I FEEL LIKE,

912
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
THAT'S THE HAPPY ENDING THAT

913
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR IN THIS

914
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
STORY.

915
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
IS TO SEE HOW IT ACTUALLY

916
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
HAPPENED THAT THEY ALL CAME OUT.

917
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
>> THIS IS THE WORST THING ABOUT

918
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH, IS

919
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE

920
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
STILL SAY, WELL, THERE'S NO
SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE.

921
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
THEY HAVEN'T CAUGHT THE REAL

922
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
KILLER.
THIS IS THE TERRIBLE STIGMA YOU

923
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
CARRY WITH YOU.

924
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
>> IT IS.

925
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
AND IT WILL HANG OVER OUR HEADS.

926
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I HATE TALKING ABOUT THIS.

927
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
HAVING TO TALK ABOUT THE CASE
DAY AFTER DAY.

928
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
IT IS ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE TO

929
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
ME.

930
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE, IMAGINE

931
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
HAVING TO TALK ABOUT THE WORST

932
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU

933
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

934
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IF WE

935
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
DON'T KEEP DOING IT, WE WILL

936
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
HAVE THAT STIGMA HANGING OVER

937
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
OUR HEADS.
WE HAVE TO KEEP LETTING THE

938
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
STATE OF ARKANSAS KNOW WE'RE NOT

939
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL YOU DO THE

940
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
RIGHT THING.

941
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
>> HOW IMPORTANT TO YOU AND

942
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
POWERFUL TO YOU HAS IT BEEN TO
HAVE LORI'S UNEQUIVOCAL BACKING

943
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
AND SUPPORT TO YOU.

944
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
>> I COULDN'T HAVE SURVIVED IN

945
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
PRISON AND OUT OF PRISON WITHOUT
HER.

946
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
WHEN I CON TAKE ANOTHER STEP

947
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
WHEN I FELT LIKE I COULDN'T GO
ON, IT WAS HER.

948
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
SHE IS WHAT WOULD CARRY ME

949
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
FORWARD, MENTALLY, EMOTIONALLY,
SPIRITUALLY UNTIL I COULD WALK

950
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
AGAIN.

951
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
>> IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

952
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
>> THANK YOU.

953
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
>> I WISH YOU THE VERY BEST, ALL
OF YOU, WITH THE DOCUMENTARY.

954
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
IT IS A VERY POWERFUL FILM.

955
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I URGE PEOPLE TO SEE IT.
THEY STILL HAVE NO REAL IDEA

956
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT, AND TO

957
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
UNDERSTAND JUST HOW FAR YOU'VE
COME AND WHAT YOU'VE HAD TO GO

958
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
THROUGH.

959
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
IT IS CALLED "WEST OF MEMPHIS"

960
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
COMING OUT DECEMBER.

961
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
THE CD COMES OUT IN JANUARY.

962
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
YOUR BOOK IS OUT NOW.

963
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
>> THANK YOU.
ñ?

964
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
>>> TOMORROW NIGHT, ONE OF MY

965
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
FAVORITE INTERVIEWS SINCE I
JOINED CNN NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO,

966
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
A CONVERSATION WITH BARBRA

967
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
STREISAND, AN HOUR WITH ONE OF

968
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
THE GREATEST ENTERTAINERS IN
HISTORY.

969
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
SHE IS A TRUE ICON AND SHE TALKS
WITH REMARKABLE CANDOR ABOUT HER

970
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE.

971
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
HER RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANY
PEOPLE, INCLUDING MARLON BRANDO.

972
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,000
HERE IS A PREVIEW.

973
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
>> WE ONCE WENT ON A SHORT ROAD

974
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
TRIP TOGETHER.

975
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
>> YOU AND MARLON BRANDO?
>> MM-HM.

976
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
>> THIS IS FANTASTIC.
WHERE DID YOU GO?

977
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
>> HE WANTED TO TAKE ME TO THE

978
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
DESERT TO SEE THE WILD FLOWERS.

979
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
>> I'LL BET HE DID.
>> AND SLEEP OVER IN A GHOST

980
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
TOWN, HE SAID.
