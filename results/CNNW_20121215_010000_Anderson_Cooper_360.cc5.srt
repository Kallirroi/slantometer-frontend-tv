00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
SURE EVERYBODY ELSE IS SAFE.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
>> SOME PEOPLE WERE EVEN LIKE

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
FELT LIKE THEY HAD A STOMACH

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
ACHE.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
>> IT'S THE MOST TRAUMATIC EVENT

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I EVER EXPERIENCED OR EVEN

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
CONSIDERED.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
>> THEY LET THE STUDENTS OUT AND

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
MY DAUGHTER AND HER TEACHER OUT

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
AND AS MY DAUGHTER IS WALKING

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
OUT, SHE DID SEE IT.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
>> THIS IS THE WORST SCHOOL YARD

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
CATASTROPHE IN HISTORY.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
>> QUITE A FEW KIDS PERISHED.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
>> BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
>> THE PARENTS WERE WAITING FOR

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
THEIR CHILDREN TO COME OUT AND

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
THOUGHT THEY WERE STILL ALIVE.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
>> HOW DO YOU WRAP YOUR MIND

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
AROUND SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
>> THE COMMUNITY TRYING TO MAKE

AFTER IT HAPPENED.

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
IT IS A HORROR BEYOND WORDS.

56
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
WE WANT HISTORY TO REMEMBER THE

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
INCLUDING THAT OF THE KILLER.

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
ONCE.
IT'S ADAM LANZA.

WE WON'T BE SAYING IT MUCH

78
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
TONIGHT.
HE WAS 20 AND HIS MOTHER TAUGHT

79
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
AT THE SCHOOL.

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
SHE WAS FOUND DEAD AT THE FAMILY

SHE BOUGHT THE WEAPONS HER SON

84
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
USED LEGALLY.
THE POLICE IN HOBOKEN TOOK THE

KILLER'S OLDER BROTHER IN FOR

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
QUESTIONING.

87
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
THEY DO NOT LABEL HIM A SUSPECT

88
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
AND NO WORD OF WHY HE IS IN

89
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
CUSTODY.

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING.

91
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
>> THE CONNECTICUT SCHOOL

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
DISTRICT ON LOCKDOWN.

93
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
>> THE FIRST WORD WAS CHILLING

94
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
AND IT GOT WORSE.

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

98
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
>> WITH EACH NEW REPORT THE

99
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
HORROR DEEPENED.

100
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
>> THE REPORTS SAY THE NUMBER OF

101
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
DEAD CLOSER TO 30 THAN TO 20 AND

102
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
SADLY MOST OF THEM ARE CHILDREN.

103
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
>> EVERY DETAIL AND EVERY FACT

104
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
BROUGHT MORE SADNESS.

105
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
EACH FRESH PIECE OF INFORMATION

106
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
A PART OF THE PICTURE.

107
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
A SCHOOL, KINDERGARTEN THROUGH

108
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
FOURTH GRADE, A SANCTUARY THAT

109
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A PLACE OF

110
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
SAFETY TORN APART.

111
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
>> SHE HEARD THE INTERCOM COME

112
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
ON THE SCHOOL AND HEARD A SCREAM

113
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
AND HEARD A GUNSHOT.

114
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
TWO GUNSHOTS.

115
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THEN THE SCHOOL WENT INTO

116
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
LOCKDOWN.

MURDER WITH TWO PISTOLS AND A

MILITARY-STYLE RIFLE.
IN PARTS OF THE SCHOOL, STUDENTS

133
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
WERE TOLD TO HIDE IN CORNERS.

134
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
TEACHERS RISKED THEIR LIVES TO

135
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
PULL BOYS AND GIRLS TO SAFETY.

136
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
>> SO GRATEFUL TO THE TEACHER

137
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
WHO SAVED HIM.

138
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
>> THE TEACHER SAVED HIS LIFE?

139
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
>> SHE DEFINITELY DID.

140
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
HE HAD BULLETS GOING BY HIM AND

141
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
SHE GRABBED HIM AND ANOTHER

142
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
CHILD AND PULLED THEM INTO A

143
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
CLASSROOM.

144
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
>> THEY WERE EVACUATED INTO A

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
FIREHOUSE WHERE FRANTIC PARENTS

146
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000

147
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000

I DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING THAT

189
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
FAMILIES IN CONNECTICUT CANNOT

190
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
DO THAT TONIGHT.

191
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THEY NEED ALL OF US RIGHT NOW.

192
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
>> WE WILL BRING YOU ALL OF

193
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S COMMENTS LATER

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
ON IN THIS HOUR AHEAD.

195
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN IS ON THE SCENE

196
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
WITH JAY PAUL VANCE WITH THE

197
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE.

198
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
SOLEDAD?

199
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
>> Reporter: JOINING HIM IS

200
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
GEORGE SINKO.

201
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
YOU SPEND A LONG TIME FOR THE

202
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
FULL DAY ON THE SCENE.

203
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
YOU CAME BACK FROM BEING INSIDE

204
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
THE SCENE.
YOU WILL PROCESS THE SCENE

205
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
THROUGH SUNDAY.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?

206
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
>> A LOT OF WORK GOES INTO A

207
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION LIKE

208
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
THIS.

209
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THE PRIORITY LIKE THAT IS
IDENTIFYING THE VICTIMS.

210
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
WE SAID 18 CHILDREN IN THERE AND

211
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
SIX ADULTS.

212
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
THE SHOOTER.

213
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
WE NEED TO POSITIVE LIE IDENTIFY

214
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
WHICH IS WHICH.

215
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE IS

216
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WITH THEM NOW IN THAT PROCESS.

217
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
WE ARE HOPEFUL WE CAN ACCOMPLISH

218
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
THAT BY SOMETIME IN THE EARLY

219
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
MORNING HOURS.

220
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
>> DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THE

221
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
BODIES OF THE CHILDREN AND THOSE

222
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
KILLED ARE STILL WHERE THEY

223
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
FELL?

224
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

225
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
YES.
>> THEY WILL BE THERE.

226
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
HAVE YOU ALLOWED THE PARENTS TO

227
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
SEE THEIR CHILDREN.

228
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
>> NO.
THIS IS A CRIME SCENE.

229
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
WE NEED TO IDENTIFY THEM.

230
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
WE HAVE A TENTATIVE

231
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
IDENTIFICATION, BUT WE NEED TO

232
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
POSITIVELY IDENTIFY THEM AND WE

233
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
ARE DOING IT AS QUICKLY AS WE

234
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
POSSIBLY CAN.

235
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
>> YOU TALKED IN OTHER PRESS

236
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
CONFERENCES ABOUT THE PARTNERS

237
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
YOU HAVE IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

238
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
CAN YOU FILL ME IN ON WHAT THEY

239
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
ARE TELLING ME ABOUT WHAT'S

240
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
HAPPENING IN HOBOKEN WHERE WE

241
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
KNOW THE SHOOTER'S BROTHER HAS

242
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
BEEN INTERVIEWED BY OFFICIALS

243
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
THERE.

244
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
WE KNOW THAT THE SHOOTER'S

245
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
FATHER HAS BEEN TALKING TO LAW

246
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
ENFORCEMENT AS WELL.

247
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
>> WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED

248
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
ANYONE.

249
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
WE WILL NOT IDENTIFY ANYONE YET

250
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH PARTNERS

251
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
AS NEEDED.

252
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
AS THEY CROSS THE LINE AND

253
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
DETERMINE THEY NEED INFORMATION

254
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
OUT OF STATE REGARDLESS OF WHAT

255
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
IT MIGHT BE.
WE WILL GET THEM TO ACCOMPLISH

256
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
THAT TASK FOR US.

257
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
THERE HAD BEEN ISSUES IN NEW

258
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
JERSEY AND OTHER STATES WHERE

259
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
OUR INVESTIGATORS HAVE CONTACTED

260
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
THE AGENCIES TO ASSIST US IN

261
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
THIS CASE.

262
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
>> LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION IF

263
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I CAN.

264
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE

265
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
PERSON WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE THE

266
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
SHOOTER, NOW DECEASED, IN THE

267
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
BUILDING STILL, HAD NO CRIMINAL

268
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
RECORD AS FAR AS WE KNOW.

269
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
THERE OFTEN THINGS WE CALL KNOWN

270
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
TO POLICE.

271
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
A FAMILY HAD BEEN CONTACTING

272
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
POLICE AND YOU AS A POLICE

273
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
OFFICER WOULD KNOW THEM.

274
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE

275
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
FAMILY.

276
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
>> AT THIS TIME WE ARE NOT GOING

277
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
TO COMMENT ON THE FAMILY AS THE

278
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
LIEUTENANT SAID.
WE ARE NOT CONFIRMING IDENTITIES

279
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
UNTIL WE ARE SURE POSITIVELY WHO

280
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
WE HAVE HERE.

281
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO DO THAT
TOMORROW.

282
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
>> IS THERE ANY NARRATIVE THAT

283
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PIECE

284
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
TOGETHER ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY

285
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
HAPPENED?

286
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
WE HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE

287
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
WEAPONRY AND ABOUT THE VICTIMS.

288
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
WE HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE

289
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
IN DIFFERENT STATES NOW BEING

290
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
QUESTIONED.

291
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
IS THERE ANY STORY THAT ANSWERS

292
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
THE BIG QUESTION WHICH IS WHY?

293
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

294
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL DO

295
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
TO WORK TOGETHER.

296
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
WE WILL LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED.

297
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
WE'LL GO BACK AND UNCOVER EVERY

298
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
BIT OF INFORMATION AND TRY TO

299
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
ANSWER THE QUESTION AS TO WHY.

300
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
WE CONSIDER AN INVESTIGATION

301
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
LIKE THIS FOOB R TO BE MASSIVE.

302
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
IT'S LIKE EYE PUZZLE.

303
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
WE HAVE TO PUT THE PIECESING TO

304
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
TO DRAW A PICTURE AS TO HOW AND

305
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
WHY THIS OCCURRED.

306
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
>> THERE HAVE BEEN REPORT THAT

307
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
IS THE SHOOTER AND YOU ARE NOT

308
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
NAMING HIM, BUT HE HAS BEEN

309
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
NAMED IN REPORTS HAD A

310
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

311
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
OR IN SOME DESCRIPTIONS A MENTAL

312
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
DISORDER.

313
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
YOU CAN CONFIRM THAT?

314
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
>> WE CAN'T.

315
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
WE CAN'T DISCUSS AT THIS POINT

316
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
IN TIME ANYTHING TO DO WITH ANY

317
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
OF THE VICTIMS OR THE DECEASED

318
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
WHATSOEVER UNTIL WE ARE PREPARED

319
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
TO DO SO.

320
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
WE ANTICIPATE THAT WILL BE

321
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
TOMORROW.
FOR SOME REASONS WE WILL

322
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
WITHHOLD THAT INFORMATION.
>> WHEN WILL YOU ALLOW PARENTS

323
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
TO GO AND GET THE BODIES OF

324
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
THEIR CHILDREN.
>> AS SOON AS WE CAN CONFIRM.

325
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
WE ARE VERY EARLY INTO THE

326
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
INVESTIGATION.

327
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
IT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY SENSITIVE
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE

328
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
RIGHT.

329
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
>> FOR MUST BE HORRIBLE AND

TO SEE THOSE THEY LOST.
THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US.

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE TONE HERE IS

335
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
JUST TERRIBLE AND SO SAD AND

336
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
JUST FRAUGHT WITH GRIEF AS WELL.

WE WILL TALK TO PEOPLE WHO SOME

338
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
ARE STILL GRAPPLING AND TRYING

339
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EXACT EXACTLY

340
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
HAPPENED HERE TODAY.

341
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I WANT TO SEND IT BACK TO YOU.

342
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
>> I'M NOT SURE IT'S SOMETHING

343
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
WE CAN UNDERSTAND.

344
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
WE CAN GET AS MANY DETAILS AS WE

345
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000

AS POSSIBLE.

349
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FATHOM WHAT

350
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
THE PEOPLE OF NEWTOWN ARE GOING

351
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
THROUGH AND IN PARTICULAR THE

352
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
PARENTS AND THE SIBLINGS AND THE

353
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE CHILDREN

354
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
WHOSE LITTLE LIVES WERE TAKEN

355
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
TODAY.
SO MANY LIVES LOST AND SO MANY

356
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
MORE LIVES FOREVER CHANGED.

JASON CARROLL JOINS US NOW.

364
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
YOU HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE.

365
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING TO YOU?

366
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
WHAT HAS THE MEAD BEEN LIKE?

367
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000

HUNDREDS WHO ARE GATHERED

370
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
OUTSIDE SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE

371
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
WASN'T ENOUGH ROOM INSIDE THE

372
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
CHURCH.
THEY ARE STUNNED.

373
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
NO OTHER WORD FOR IT.

374
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
THEY ARE STUNNED AND HURT.

375
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
THEY ARE HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE

376
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
LEANING ON EACH OTHER FOR

377
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
SUPPORT.
WHEN YOU ARE HURT SO BADLY LIKE

378
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
THIS, YOU TURN TO YOUR LOVED

379
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
ONES AND FAMILY AND IN SOME

380
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
CASES YOU TURN TO YOUR FAITH.

381
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING OUTSIDE

382
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
AS THIS VIGIL CONTINUES THROUGH

383
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
THE NIGHT.
IN TALKING TO THE PEOPLE HERE

384
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
AND TRYING TO GET TO WHERE WE

385
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
WERE, WE PASSED A STARBUCKS.

386
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
A WOMAN GOT OUT OF A CAR AND SHE

387
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
WAS IN TEARS.

388
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
WE WENT BY A RESTAURANT.

389
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
A WOMAN WAS OUTSIDE THERE AND

390
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
HER HUSBAND AND A YOUNG BOY WERE

391
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
VERY UPSET.

392
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
AS WE CAME DOWN THE ROAD WHERE

393
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
THE CHURCH IS, I SAW A WOMAN WHO

394
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
WAS TALKING DOWN THE STREET AND

395
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS STUNNED.

396
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
COMPLETELY STUNNED.

397
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
SHE WAS CRYING AND WANDERING

398
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
DOWN THE STREET.

399
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
EVEN BEFORE WE GOT CLOSE TO THE

400
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
SCENE OF WHERE IT HAPPENED, YOU

401
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
KNEW HOW DEEPLY HURT THIS

402
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
COMMUNITY WAS BY WHAT HAPPENED.

403
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SEEING

404
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
OUTSIDE NOW.

405
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
THIS IS A CLOSE SKMUNT IT'S NO

406
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
SURPRISE THAT THE PEOPLE KNEW

407
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE AT THE

408
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
SCHOOL.

409
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
ONE MAN KNEW THE PRINCIPAL, DAWN

410
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
HOCHSPRUNG AND HOW MUCH SHE

411
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
LOVED THE SCHOOL AND THE

412
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
CHILDREN.
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO WHAT HE

413
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
HAD TO SAY ABOUT HER.

414
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
LET ME TELL YOU THAT IN TERMS OF

415
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
WHAT HE HAD TO SAY, IT WAS THAT

416
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
THIS WAS A WOMAN WHO CARED VERY

417
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
DEEPLY NOT JUST ABOUT THE

418
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
SCHOOL, BUT SHE WORKED THERE

419
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
SINCE JUNE OF 2010 AND SHE CARED

420
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
ABOUT THE STUDENTS AND HER JOB.

421
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
IT WAS TOUGH FOR HIM TO TAKE AND

422
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
THAT'S WHY HE AND SO MANY OTHERS

423
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
ARE HERE TONIGHT.

424
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
ANDERSON?

425
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
>> I KNOW YOU GOT A CHANCE TO

426
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
TALK TO THE DEACON IN THE

427
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
COMMUNITY AS WELL.

428
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
.
>> THAT'S TRUE.

429
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
THE DEACON IS HELPING OUT

430
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
INDIVIDUALS TONIGHT AND BEFORE

431
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
THINGS GOT UNDER WAY.

432
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I SAID WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING

433
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
AND HE SAID NEARLY 100 PEOPLE

434
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
HAVE COME TO THE CHURCH DOORS SO

435
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
FAR LOOKING FOR SUPPORT.

436
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
LOOKING FOR COMFORT IN ANY SORT

437
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
OF WAY.

438
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
HE TALKED ABOUT ONE 6-YEAR-OLD

439
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
GIRL WHO HE KNEW WHO WAS KILLED

440
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
IN THE SHOOTING AND HOW DEEPLY

441
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
THAT HAD AFFECTED HIM.

442
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
NOT ONLY IS HE HURT, BUT HE HAS

443
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
TO BE THE PILLAR OF STRENGTH AND

444
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
PROVIDE STRENGTH WHILE HE IS

445
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
TRYING TO HEAL.

446
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
ANDERSON?

447
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
>> WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO A PARENT

448
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
WHO LOST A CHILD?

449
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
JASON, THANKS.

450
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
AS WORD SPREAD SO DID THE SHOCK

451
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
AND THE HORROR AND NOW OF COURSE

452
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
THE GRIEVING.

453
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
>> YOU CAN NEVER BE PREPARED FOR

454
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
THIS KIND OF INCIDENT.

455
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
WHAT HAPPENED SKW TRANSPIRED AT

456
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
THE SCHOOL BUILDING WILL LEAVE A

457
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
MARK ON THIS COMMUNITY AND EVERY

458
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
FAMILY IMPACTED.

459
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I ONLY ASK THAT OUR FELLOW

463
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
VICTIMS IN THEIR PRAYERS.

464
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
>> HIS MAIN RESPONSE IS THE

465
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
INVESTIGATION WITH LOCAL
AUTHORITIES.

466
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
WE ARE ECHL SIGHING WE DO NOT

467
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
WANT TO GIVE UNDUE ATTENTION TO

468
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
THE KILLER WHO COMMITTED THE

469
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
MURDERS AND BE PART OF HELPING

HISTORY REMEMBER HIS NAME.
WE WANT THE VICTIMS TO BE

471
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
REMEMBERED.

472
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
WE DO BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO

473
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
UNDERSTAND WHATEVER WE CAN ABOUT

474
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
THIS PERSON AND THE CRIME.

475
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
HOW WE CAME TO THIS POINT.

476
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI IS HANDLING

477
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
COVERAGE OF THE INVESTIGATION.

478
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
WHAT'S THE LATEST FROM LAW
ENFORCEMENT?

479
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
>> WE ARE TRYING TO GET DOWN TO

480
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
MORE ABOUT THE SHOOTER.

481
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
ADAM LANZA WAS 20 YEARS OLD AND

482
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
WE KNOW ACCORDING TO THE SOURCES

483
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
HERE'S ARMED WITH THREE GUNS AND

484
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
WEARING BLACK BATTLE FATIGUES

485
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
AND A MILITARY VEST.

486
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
WHERE DID HE GET THE THREE GUNS

487
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
AND WHAT KIND WERE THEY?

488
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
THEY WERE THREE HAND GUNS, A

489
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
GLOCK AND A SIG SAUER AND A BUSH

490
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
MASTER.
THIS IS A SEMI AUTOMATIC GUN AND

491
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
WE HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE TYPE

492
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
OF WEAPON IT IS.

493
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
WE UNDERSTAND FROM OUR SOURCES

494
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
THAT THESE GUNS WERE ALL

495
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
REGISTERED AND BELONGED TO HIS

496
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
MOTHER.

497
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
HIS MOTHER WHO WAS ALSO KILLED.

498
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
THE MOTHER'S BODY WAS FOUND IN

499
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
THE HOUSE, A FAMILY HOME HERE IN

500
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
THIS AREA.
WE DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT

501
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
ADAM LANZA.

502
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
WE KNOW THAT HIS BROTHER RYAN

503
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
WAS A BIT OLDER AT 24 YEARS OLD.

504
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
HE WAS TAKEN IN TO CUSTODY FOR

505
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
QUESTIONING.
HE IS NOT CALLED A SUSPECT, BUT

506
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
HE WAS IN HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY

507
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
WHEN THEY BROUGHT HIM IN FOR

508
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
QUESTIONING.
THAT'S WHERE HE LIVES.

509
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
THEY WANTED TO TRY TO FIND OUT

510
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
WHAT IF ANYTHING HE KNEW AND

511
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
WHAT HE COULD TELL THEM ABOUT

512
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
HIS BROTHER.

513
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
WHAT INFORMATION HE CAN GIVE

514
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND AND POLICE

515
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
ALSO QUESTIONED THEIR FATHER.

516
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
HE STILL LIVES IN THIS AREA.

517
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
HE IS DIVORCED FROM HIS WIFE WHO

518
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS HERE AND

519
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
REMARRIED.
HE TOO IS BEING QUESTIONED TO

520
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
SHED LIGHT ON ADAM LANZA AND WHY

521
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
THIS TRAGEDY HAPPENED.

522
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
ANDERSON?
>> SUSAN, THANKS VERY MUCH.

523
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
WE ARE STARTING TO HEAR

524
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
INSPIRING REPORTS ABOUT HOW THE

525
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
TEACHERS HANDLED THIS

526
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
UNIMAGINABLE TRAUMA.

527
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
KAITLYN IS A FIRST GRADE TEACHER

528
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
AND RUSHED 15 CHILDREN, 6 AND

529
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
7-YEAR-OLDS INTO A SMALL

530
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
BATHROOM AND BARRICADED IT WITH

531
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
A BOOKSHELF AND SAID THERE WERE

532
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
BAD GUYS AND THEY HAD TO WAIT

533
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
FOR THE GOOD GUYS.

534
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
WHEN THE CHILDREN STARTED

535
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
CRYING, SHE WOULD TOLD THE FACES

536
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
IN HER HANDS AND SAY IT WAS

537
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
GOING TO BE OKAY AND SAID SHOW

538
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
ME HER SMILE.

539
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
THE KIDS TOLD HER HEART BREAKING

540
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
THINGS AND SAID THEY WANTED TO

541
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
GO HOME FOR CHRISTMAS AND HUG

542
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
THEIR MOMS.

543
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
CLEARLY AN EXTRAORDINARY TEACHER

544
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
TOLD ABC NEWS WHAT HAPPENED
NEXT.

545
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
>> I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT I

546
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
LOVE YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

547
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

548
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE LAST

549
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
THING THEY WERE EVER GOING TO

550
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
HEAR AND I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL

551
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
GOING TO DIE.

552
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S OKAY.

553
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
TEACHERS.
I WANTED THEM TO KNOW SOMEONE

554
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
LOVED THEM AND THAT TO BE ONE OF

555
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
THE LAST THINGS THEY HEARD.

556
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
NOT THE GUNFIRE IN THE HALL WAY.

557
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
IT WAS SO HORRIBLE.

558
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
>> KAITLYN SAID SHE HEARD THE

559
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
GUNFIRE STOP AND WHEN THE POLICE

560
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
CAME AND STARTED KNOCKING, SHE

561
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
WANTED TO PUT THEIR BADGES UNDER

562
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
THE DOOR.

563
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
THE TEACHER PROTECTING HER

564
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
STUDENTS WITH EVERYTHING SHE

565
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
HAD.

566
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
TWEET ME ABOUT THIS.

567
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I WILL BE TWEETING AS WELL.

568
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
EVEN THOUGH NOTHING CAN EXPLAIN

569
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
THIS, A SEARCH FOR MOTIVE AND

570
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
REMEMBERING THE FALLEN INCLUDING

571
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
SANDY HOOKS'S PRINCIPAL WHO IN

572
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
ADDITION HER JOB WAS RAISING

573
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
FIVE CHILDREN OF HER OWN.

574
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Bye!
Bye!

575
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Bye!

576
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Santa, we made a video for
your trip!

577
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yeah, you can watch it on your
sleigh!

578
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
OK!

579
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Here you go.

580
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Aw, thanks elves.

581
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I also made you a video.

582
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You are so sweet.

583
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But you probably shouldn't watch
it on the sleigh.

584
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Say goodbye to Santa boys!

585
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Bye!

586
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Good bye Santa!

587
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Bye!

591
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
>>> IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S

592
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
EVEN POSSIBLE.

593
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
YOU READ IT IN THE PAPER OR SEE

594
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
IT IN THE NEWS AND YOU ARE LIKE

595
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
OH, MY GOD, THAT POOR FAMILY AND

596
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
SOMETHING HAPPENS SO CLOSE TO

597
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
HOME.

598
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
IT'S LIKE I THINK I'M STILL IN

599
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
SHOCK TO BE HONEST.

600
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FEELING

601
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
THE SAME TONIGHT.

602
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
ALL-AROUND THE WORLD.

603
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
THE MASSACRE IN SANDY HOOK IS

604
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
THE DEADLIEST SCHOOL SHOOTING IN

605
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
AMERICAN HISTORY AND ALL THE

606
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
WORDS SPOKEN AND I'M SPEAKING

607
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
TONIGHT AND WILL SPEAK LATER

608
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
TONIGHT ALL SOUND SO SMALL IN

609
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
THE FACE OF THIS HORROR.

610
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
20 CHILDREN AND SIX ADULTS WERE

611
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
ALIVE LAST NIGHT GETTING READY

612
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
FOR A DAY OF SCHOOL AND TONIGHT

613
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
THEY ARE GONE.

614
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE TO THE

615
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
NATION EARLIER AND WE PLAYED

616
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
SOME OF HIS COMMENTS AND WE

617
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
THINK IT'S WORTH HEARING ALL OF

618
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
WHAT HE SAID.

619
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
>> THIS AFTERNOON I SPOKE TO

620
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
GOVERNOR MALLOY AND FBI DIRECTOR

621
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
MULLER.

622
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I OFFERED MY CONDOLENCES ON

623
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
BEHALF OF THE NATION AND MADE IT

624
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
CLEAR HE WILL HAVE EVERY SINGLE

625
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
RESOURCE HE NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE

626
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
THE HEINOUS CRIME, CARE FOR THE

627
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
VICTIMS, COUNSEL THEIR FAMILIES.

628
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
WE HAVE ENDURED TOO MANY OF

629
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
THESE TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST FEW

630
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
YEARS AND EACH TIME I LEARN THE

631
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
NEWS, I REACT NOT AS A

632
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
PRESIDENT, BUT AS ANYBODY ELSE

633
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
WOULD.

634
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
AS A PARENT.

635
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE TODAY.

636
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I KNOW THERE IS NOT A PARENT IN

637
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

638
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I

639
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
DO.

640
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

641
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

642
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

643
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

644
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

645
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

646
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

647
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

648
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

649
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
TEACHERS, MEN AND WOMEN WHO

650
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING

651
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
OUR CHILDREN FULFILL THEIR

652
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
DREAMS.
SO OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY.

653
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
FOR THE PARENTS AND

654
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
GRANDPARENTS, SISTERS AND

655
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
BROTHERS OF THESE LITTLE

656
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
CHILDREN AND FOR THE FAMILIES OF

657
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
THE ADULTS WHO WERE LOST.

658
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

659
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
PARENTS OF THE SURVIVORS AS

660
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
WELL.

661
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
FOR AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE TO

662
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

663
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
TONIGHT, THEY KNOW THAT THEIR

664
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY

665
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
AND FLOWER NO WORDS THAT WILL

666
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
EASE THEIR PAIN.

667
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
AS A COUNTRY WE HAVE BEEN

668
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
THROUGH THIS TOO MANY TIMES.

669
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
WHETHER IT'S AN ELEMENTARY

670
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN OR A SHOPPING

671
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
MALL IN OREGON.

672
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
OR A TEMPLE IN WISCONSIN OR A

673
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
MOVIE THEATER IN AURORA OR A

674
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
STREET CORNER IN CHICAGO.

675
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE OUR

676
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
NEIGHBORHOODS.
THESE CHILDREN ARE OUR CHILDREN.

677
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
WE WILL HAVE TO COMING TO AND

678
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION TO

679
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES LIKE

680
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
REGARDLESS OF THE POLITICS.

681
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
THIS EVENING MICHELLE AND I WILL

682
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
DO WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT IN

683
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
AMERICA WILL DO WHICH IS HUG OUR

684
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
CHILDREN A LITTLE TIGHTER AND

685
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
WILL TELL THEM WE LOVE THEM.

686
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
AND WE WILL REMIND EACH OTHER

687
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
HOW DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

688
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
FAMILIES IN CONNECTICUT CANNOT

689
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
DO THAT TONIGHT.

690
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
THEY NEED ALL OF US RIGHT NOW.

691
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
IN OUR DAYS TO COME, THAT

692
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
COMMUNITY NEEDS US TO BE AT OUR

693
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
BEST AS AMERICANS AND I WILL DO

694
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER AS

695
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
PRESIDENT TO HELP.

696
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
BECAUSE NOTHING CAN FILL THE

697
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
SPACE OF A LOST CHILD OR LOVED

698
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
ONE, ALL OF US CAN EXTEND A HAND

699
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
TO THOSE IN NEED TO REMIND THEM

700
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
THAT WE ARE THERE FOR THEM AND

701
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
THAT WE ARE PRAYING FOR THEM AND

702
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
THAT THE LOVE THEY FELT FOR

703
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
THOSE THEY LOST ENDURES NOT JUST

704
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
IN THEIR MEMORIES, BUT ALSO IN

705
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
OURS.

706
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF THE

707
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
VICTIMS AND IN THE WORDS OF

708
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
SCRIPTURE, HEAL THE

709
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
BROKENHEARTED AND BIND UP THEIR

710
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
WOUNDS.

711
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
>> POLICE HAVE NOT RELEASED THE

712
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
NAMES OF THE VICTIMS.

713
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
THE CHILDREN'S LITTLE BODIES

714
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
STILL INSIDE THAT SCHOOL AND THE

715
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
PARENTS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

716
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
SEE THEM YET.

717
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
AS WE LEARN WHO THEY ARE, WHEN

718
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
IT'S APPROPRIATE WE WILL FOCUS

719
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
ON THEIR LIVES AND THEIR MEMORY.

720
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
AS THE VICTIMS, WE WANT HISTORY

721
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
TO REMEMBER AND HONOR.

722
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
THE SCHOOL'S PRINCIPAL AND

723
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE AMONG THE

724
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
DEAD.
HERE'S WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT

725
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
BOTH WOMEN.

726
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
47-YEAR-OLD DAWN HOCHSPRUNG,

727
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
JASON CARROLL MENTIONED HER.

728
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
SHE BECAME THE PRINCIPAL BACK IN

729
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
2010.
SHE ARRIVED WITH 12 YEARS OF

730
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
EXPERIENCE AS A SCHOOL

731
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
ADMINISTRATOR AND SHE WAS

732
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
RAISING TWO DAUGHTERS AND THREE

733
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
STEPDAUGHTERS.
THOSE WHO WORKED WITH HOCHSPRUNG

734
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
SAID SHE WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT

735
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
HER JOB AND EXPERT ON

736
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
CURRICULUM, BUT FUN, BUT FIRM

737
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
LEADER.

738
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
ONE FRIEND SAID SHE WAS THE KIND

739
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
OF PERSON YOU WANT TO BE

740
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
EDUCATING YOUR KIDS AND THE KIDS

741
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
LOVED HER.

742
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
LITTLE KIDS KNOW WHEN SOMEONE

743
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000

SOLEDAD?

GRADER AT THE SCHOOL AND SHE HAD

780
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
A TERRIFYING DAY.

781
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
HOW ARE YOU DOING NOW?

782
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
>> IT'S STILL PROCESSING.

783
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
IT'S SCARY.

784
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
NO WORDS.

785
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
>> HOW IS YOUR SON DOING?

786
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
ARE YOU ENCOURAGING HIM TO TALK

787
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
AND SHARE OR TRYING TO TAKE HIS

788
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
MIND OFF THE TERRIBLE THINGS HE

789
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
WITNESSED AND EXPERIENCED?

790
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
>> WE HAVE DONE A LITTLE BIT OF

791
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
EACH.

792
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
TRYING TO SPOIL HIM AND TAKE HIS

793
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
MIND OFF OF IT AND LET HIM PLAY

794
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
PS 3 AND TRYING TO TALK AND

795
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
PROCESS WITH HIM.

796
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
LETTING THEM KNOW WHEN WE FOUND

797
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
OUT ABOUT OTHER CHILDREN THAT HE

798
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
KNOWS.

799
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
>> YOU GOT AN ELECTRONIC ALERT.

800
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
THIS IS THE MOST TERRIFYING

801
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
THING.
>> MY HUSBAND AND I WERE SITTING

802
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
HERE AND A NEIGHBOR WAS OVER.

803
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
WE GOT A ROBO CALL THAT ALL

804
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
SCHOOLS WERE IN LOCKDOWN DUE TO

805
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
A REPORTED SHOOTING.

806
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
WE IMMEDIATELY GOT ONLINE AND MY

807
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
NEIGHBOR CALLED HER HUSBAND WHO

808
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
SAID HE HEARD IT WAS SANDY HOOK

809
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
AND WE SAW IT ONLINE AND HOPPED

810
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
IN THE CAR AND HEADED TO THE

811
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
SCHOOL.

812
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
>> THE SCHOOL WAS ON LOCKDOWN.

813
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN?

814
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
>> I'M NOT SURE COMPLETELY WHAT

815
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
IT MEANS.

816
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
WHEN I GOT THERE ALL OF THE

817
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
CHILDREN THAT HAD BEEN EVACUATED

818
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
IN THE FIREHOUSE.

819
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
>> HOW IS YOUR SON DOING AND HOW

820
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
ARE THE KIDS HOLDING UP?

821
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
>> IT VARIED.

822
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
MY SON SEEMED TO BE OKAY.

823
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
HE SAID MOM, I'M OKAY AND I'M

824
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
SAFE.
HE GAVE ME A HUG AND A LOT OF

825
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
CHILDREN WERE CRYING AND SCARED.

826
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
>> WHAT DID HE DESCRIBE HAD

827
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
HAPPENED?

828
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
>> HE SAID HE HEARD WHAT SOUNDED

829
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
LIKE LARGE PANS FALLING.

830
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
LOUD NOISES.

831
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
HE SAID HIS TEACHER STEPPED

832
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM AND CAME

833
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
BACK IN AND LOCKED THE DOOR.

834
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
HE HAD THEM START READING

835
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
QUIETLY.

836
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
>> HOW MUCH TIME WENT BY BETWEEN

837
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
WHEN THAT HAPPENED AND WHEN HE

838
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
GOT TO YOU?

839
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.

840
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
HE IS NOT ABLE TO PIECE HOW MUCH

841
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
TIME ACTUALLY PASSED.

842
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
HE JUST SAID AFTER A LITTLE

843
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
WHILE A POLICE OFFICER CAME AND

844
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
TOOK THEM OUT OF THE BUILDING

845
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
AND BROUGHT THEM TO THE

846
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
FIREHOUSE.
>> WE KNOW THAT THE PRINCIPAL

847
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
HAD INSTALLED A SYSTEM WHERE YOU

848
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
HAVE TO BE BUZZED IN.

849
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
>> YES.

850
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
IT'S BEEN THAT WAY FOR THE TWO

851
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
YEARS WE HAVE BEEN HERE.

852
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
YOU HAD TO RING A DOOR BELL AND

853
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
BE LET IN.

854
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
THE OFFICE IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF

855
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
THOSE DOORS.

856
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
THEY CAN LOOK OUT AND SEE WHO IS

857
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
AT THE DOOR.

858
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
>> WAS THERE A REASON FOR THAT.

859
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
IT'S TYPICAL IN BIG CITIES, BUT

860
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE RURAL, IT'S

861
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
A LITTLE BIT OF A RARITY.

862
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
>> IT'S JUST THE SAFETY OF OUR

863
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
CHILDREN IS TAKEN VERY

864
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
SERIOUSLY.
IT'S A FAIRLY LARGE SCHOOL

865
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
BETWEEN 500 AND 600 STUDENTS

866
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
THERE.
THEY WANT TO KEEP CONTROL AND

867
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
KNOW WHO IS IN THE BUILDING WITH

868
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
OUR CHILDREN.

869
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
>> I WAS TALKING TO THE STATE

870
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
POLICE AND THEY SAID THAT THEY

871
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
WERE PROCESSING THE SCENE AND

872
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
CHILDREN WERE STILL INSIDE.

873
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN TO THEIR SON

874
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
WHAP ABOUT HIS CLASSMATE?

875
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
>> WE ARE A FAIRLY RELIGIOUS

876
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
FAMILY AND WE JUST TALKED ABOUT

877
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
THAT THEY HAVE GONE TO HEAVEN.

878
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
TO BE WITH JESUS AND THAT'S

879
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
ABOUT ALL WE CAN SAY.

880
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
WE TALK ABOUT YOU ARE NOT GOING

881
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
TO SEE THEM ANYMORE AND THEY ARE

882
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
NOT GOING TO BE AROUND.

883
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
YOU REALLY JUST STRUGGLE TO FIND

884
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
THE WORDS.

885
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
>> YOU SHOULD KNOW EVERYONE IS

886
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
SENG WELL WISHES NOT JUST TO

887
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
YOU, BUT YOUR COMMUNITY AS A

888
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
WHOLE.
SO MANY PEOPLE ASKED ME TO PASS

889
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
THAT ALONG.

890
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
>> WE ARE A STRONG COMMUNITY.

891
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
IT IS STRONG FAMILY COMMUNITY

892
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
WITH A LOT OF LOVE.

893
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
WE WILL GET THROUGH IT SOMEHOW,

894
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
SOME WAY.

895
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
>> LET'S GO BACK TO ANDERSON.

896
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MORE NOW ON SANDY HOOK'S

897
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
PRINCIPAL.

898
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
WE JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT HER A

899
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
SHORT TIME AGO.

900
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
SHE IS A PROFESSOR AT SAGE

901
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
GRADUATE SCHOOL.

902
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
DAWN WAS ONE OF HER STUDENTS.

903
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT DAWN.

904
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
YOU KNEW HER.

905
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
WHAT WAS SHE LIKE?

906
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
>> I HAVE KNOWN DAWN FOR THE

907
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
PAST SEVERAL MONTHS.

908
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
THIS IS THE FIRST COURSE SHE

909
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
TOOK IN THE DOCTORAL PROGRAM.

910
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
SHE WAS A PERSON WHO LOVED THE

911
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
WORK SHE DID.

912
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
THE COURSE THAT WE ARE DOING IS

913
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
ON LEADERSHIP.

914
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
SHE LOVED LEADING CHILDREN TO

915
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
THEIR FUTURES.

916
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
SHE HAD GREAT POTENTIAL TO TON

917
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
A LOT OF OUR COURSE IS ABOUT

918
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
COURAGE.
WE READ THAT AND THIS MORNING I

919
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
READ ONE OF THE PAPERS THAT SHE

920
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
COMMITTED A FEW DAYS AGO.

921
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
IT WAS REFERENCING OVERCOMING

922
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
FEAR.

923
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
IT HAS BEEN AN EXAMPLE OF FACING

924
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
FEAR IN THE ULTIMATE SITUATION.

925
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
>> WHEN YOU READ THAT PAPER THIS

926
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
MORNING, DID YOU KNOW WHAT

927
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
HAPPENED?

928
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF GREATING

929
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
PAPERS AND TOOK A BREAK.

930
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I HEARD ABOUT IT.

931
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
THEN WENT BACK TO THE PAPERS AND

932
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
IF THISSY QUOTE FROM HER WORK

933
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
JUST POPPED AT ME.

934
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
SHE WAS ACTUALLY IN THIS PAPER

935
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
SPEAKING ABOUT OVERCOMING FEAR.

936
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
FACING ONE'S FEAR AND ACTING IN

937
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
SPITE OF FEAR.

938
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US.

939
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
WE ARE TRYING TO FOCUS ON THE

940
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
VICTIMS AND LIMITING THE USE OF

941
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
THE KILLER'S NAME.

942
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
WE DON'T WANT TO REPEAT IT OVER

943
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
AND OVER.

944
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE

945
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
ENCOURAGEMENT TO ANYONE ELSY

946
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
THAT THEY CAN BE FAMOUS THROUGH

947
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
MURDER.
WE ARE TRYING TO LEARN WHAT WE

948
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
CAN AS TO WHAT LED THIS PERSON

949
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
TO MURDER.
WHAT ARE WE LEARNING?

950
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
>> HAVING COVERED SO MANY OF

951
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
THESE, IT IS PLAYING OUGHT

952
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
ALMOST IN A SICKENING ROUTINE.

953
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
A SHOOTER WITH POSSIBLE MENTAL

954
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
HEALTH ISSUES AND A FAMILY

955
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THOSE

956
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
ISSUES.
POWERFUL GUNS EASILY ACCESSED

957
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
AND THE OUTBURST OF VIOLENCE.

958
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
THE 20-YEAR-OLD SHOOTER

959
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
BEGINNING TO PLAY OUT EXACTLY IN

960
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
THAT ORDER.

961
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
HERE'S WHAT WE DO KNOW.

962
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
THE SHOOTER HAD AN OLDER BROTHER

963
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
THAT REPORTEDLY TOLD US THAT THE

964
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
SHOOTER HAD A PERSONALITY

965
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
DISORDER.
HE MENTIONED AUTISM.

966
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
CNN HEARD THE SAME INFORMATION

967
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
FROM A MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF A

968
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
FRIEND OF THE SHOOTER IN NEWTOWN

969
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
WHERE THE SHOOTER LIVED AND HIS

970
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
MOTHER TAUGHT SCHOOL.

971
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
WE CAN CONFIRM THE GUN SUSAN

972
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
TOLD YOU ABOUT, THE TWO HAND

973
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
GUNS, THE SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLE

974
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
WAS LEGALLY OWNED BY THE

975
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
SHOOTER'S MOTHER NOW DECEASED.

976
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
AS WAS STANDARD, PEOPLE ARE

977
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
SHOCKED THAT THE PARTICULAR

978
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
SHOOTER COULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED

979
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
IN ANYTHING AS IS WITH THE CASE

980
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
OF ONE OF THE SHOOTER'S FORMER

981
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
CLASSMATES AND SCHOOL BUS

982
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
DRIVER.
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> JUST A KID.

983
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
>> JUST A KID?

984
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
>> JUST A KID.

985
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
>> NEVER ANTISOCIAL?

986
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
>> NO.
>> TROUBLE MAKER?

987
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
>> NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

988
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
>> NOTICEABLE?

989
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
DID HE BLEND INTO THE

990
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
BACKGROUND?

991
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
>> YEAH.

992
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
NOTHING THAT WOULD WARRANT ANY

993
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
OF THIS.

994
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
>> HE WENT AFTER HIS MOM AND

995
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
CLASS OF KIDS.

996
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
CAN YOU WRAP YOUR MIND ABOUT

997
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
THAT?
>> NO, I CANNOT.

998
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD DO

999
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

1000
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
>> YOUR GENERAL SENSE IS WHAT?

1001
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
>> THIS IS UNSPEAKABLE.

1002
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT -- I'M

1003
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
STILL IN SHOCK.

1004
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
EXCUSE ME A MOMENT.

1005
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I WANT TO GO.

1006
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
>> HE WAS A NICE KID.

1007
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
VERY POLITE.

1008
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
SHE RAISED VERY NICE BOYS TO ME.

1009
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S A SHOCK

1010
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
TO EVEN KNOW THEM AND REALIZE

1011
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
WHO THEY ARE AND WHO HE DID.

1012
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT

1013
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
HAPPENED.

1014
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
THAT HE SNAPPED.

1015
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
HE TOOK SUCH INNOCENT LIVES.

1016
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
>> SO ANDERSON, WHAT CAN WE

1017
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
EXPECT AS WE LEARNED IN THE CASE

1018
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
OF THE VIRGINIA TECH SHOOTING

1019
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
AND SHOOTING OF CONGRESSWOMAN

1020
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
GABBY GIFFORDS.

1021
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
THIS YEAR'S MASS KILLING AT THE

1022
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
MOVIE THEATER IN AURORA.

1023
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
EXPECT TO SEE IN HINDSIGHT,

1024
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
MULTIPLE WARNING SIGNS MAY BE

1025
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
DANGEROUS AND IGNORED AND

1026
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
PRACTICE SESSION, OBSESSIONS

1027
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
THAT WERE NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY OR

1028
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
THE FAMILY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO

1029
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
HANDLE IT.

1030
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
IN THE END THEY WILL NEVER HAVE

1031
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
AN ANSWER OR EXPLANATION THAT IS

1032
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE VICTIM'S

1033
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
FAMILIES.

1034
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
IT IS JUST SO SENSELESS.

1035
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
ANDERSON?

1036
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
>> ALWAYS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

1037
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
THAT WE ARE STARTING TO HEAR

1038
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
ABOUT AS WE POINTED OUT.

1039
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
SO OFTEN IT'S HARD FOR PARENTS

1040
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
TO GET HELP EVEN IF THEY KNOW

1041
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
THEIR CHILD HAS A PROBLEM

1042
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
BECAUSE OF LAWS ON THE BOOKS.

1043
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
ONE OF THE THINGS WE WILL BE

1044
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
LOOKING AT.
GUN LAWS, YOU WERE SAYING ALL

1045
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
THE GUNS WERE LEGALLY ACQUIRED.

1046
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
CONNECTICUT HAS SOME OF THE

1047
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
TOUGHEST GUN LAWS THERE.

1048
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
>> ALREADY CALLS FOR WE NEED TO

1049
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
STRENGTHEN THE GUN LAWS, BUT

1050
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
PEOPLE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE

1051
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
GUN LAWS ARE.

1052
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
THEY ARE VERY, VERY STRICT,

1053
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
ANDERSON.
IT'S WHAT LED THEM TO KNOW THE

1054
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
REGISTRATION OF THE GUNS.

1055
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
CONNECTICUT HAS THEIR OWN

1056
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
REGISTRY.
THE HAND GUNS, YOU HAVE TO HAVE

1057
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
A CERTIFICATE TO POSSESS THOSE

1058
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
GUNS AND THAT GOES ALONG WITH

1059
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
WITH A CLASS YOU HAVE TO TAKE

1060
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
AND YOU HAVE TO BE OVER 21

1061
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
YEARS.

1062
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
IF THAT RIFLE WAS AN ASSAULT

1063
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
RIFLE, MANY PEOPLE CAN KNOW THAT

1064
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
CONNECTICUT BANS ASSAULT RIFLES.

1065
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
THE ONES THAT WERE LEGALLY

1066
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
POSSESSED WERE GRANDFATHERED IN,

1067
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
BUT THOSE TWO WOULD NEED TO BE

1068
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
REGISTERED WITH THE STATE.

1069
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
AS WE KNOW, THESE GUNS WERE

1070
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
REGISTERED WITH THE MOTHER OF

1071
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
THE SHOOTER.

1072
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
>> APPRECIATE THE REPORTING AS

1073
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
WELL.
WITH US NOW IS DENISE.

1074
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
HER SECOND GRADER WAS IN SCHOOL

1075
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
THIS MORNING.

1076
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT THIS DAY

1077
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
HAS BEEN LIKE FOR YOU AND YOUR

1078
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
CHILD.
HOW IS YOUR CHILD AND HOW ARE

1079
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
YOU DOING?

1080
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
>> I THINK EVERYONE IS COPING AS

1081
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
BEST AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.

1082
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
IT'S SHOCKING WHEN IT HAPPENS

1083
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
ANYWHERE.
WE ARE ALL TRYING TO WRAP OUR

1084
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
ARMS AROUND THE SITUATION AS
BEST AS WE CAN.

1085
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
>> DOES YOUR DAUGHTER WANT TO

1086
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
TALK ABOUT IT WITH YOU OR ARE

1087
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
YOU ENCOURAGING HER TO OR HOW

1088
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
ARE YOU HANDLING THIS?

1089
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
A LOT OF PARENTS AROUND THE

1090
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
WORLD ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

1091
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
WHAT TO SAY TO THEIR CHILD.

1092
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
>> YOU KNOW, THE HARD THING FOR

1093
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
ME IS I'M A NEW YORKER AND I

1094
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
GUESS I'M ACCUSTOMED TO

1095
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
MANHATTAN AND ALWAYS TELLING ME

1096
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
KIDS TO BE CAREFUL.

1097
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I GUESS YOU NEVER EXPECT IT TO

1098
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
HAPPEN IN YOUR SCHOOL.

1099
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU JUST

1100
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
LET HER TALK.

1101
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
SHE MENTIONED QUITE A BIT ABOUT

1102
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
THE PRINCIPAL WHO MANY OF US

1103
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
WORKED WITH.
I WORKED WITH HER PERSONALLY

1104
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
WITH MY BUSINESS.

1105
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
THAT IS ONE PERSON I KNOW WE

1106
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
LOST ON A PERSONAL LEVEL.

1107
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE

1108
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
THE COUNSELLORS AT THE SCHOOL

1109
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
TODAY.

1110
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
THEY WERE ALL WELCOME TO GO

1111
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
THERE.
IF THEY NEED TO SPEAK TO

1112
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
SOMEBODY, THEY WILL.

1113
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
>> HAS YOUR DAUGHTER SAID MUCH

1114
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
ABOUT WHAT SHE SAW OR HEARD?

1115
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
>> SHE DID MENTION THAT SHE DID

1116
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
OF COURSE HEAR GUNSHOTS.

1117
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
THEY WERE ON THE SAME FLOOR.

1118
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
HER TEACHER MANAGED TO TAKE TWO

1119
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
CHILDREN OUT OF THE HALL WAY AND

1120
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
PULL THEM INTO THE CLASSROOM.

1121
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
LOCK THE DOOR AND MOVE EVERYBODY

1122
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

1123
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
ROOM.
IT WAS VERY CONFUSING AS IT

1124
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
WOULD BE IN ANY OF THESE CASES

1125
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
TO GO AND PICK UP YOUR CHILD

1126
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
ONCE WE FIGURED OUT THAT

1127
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
EVERYTHING WAS DISPATCHED TO

1128
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

1129
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PARENTS

1130
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
THERE ALONG WITH A FRIEND OF

1131
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
MINE.
WE FIGURED OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON

1132
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
AND I RAN OVER THERE.

1133
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
THEY WERE SMART TO GET THEM OUT

1134
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
OF THE BUILDING AND MOVE THEM

1135
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
OVER TO THE FIREHOUSE.

1136
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
YOU CAN SEE THAT MY DAUGHTER'S

1137
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
TEACHER WAS VISIBLY UPSET AS

1138
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
WELL AS MANY OF THE CHILDREN

1139
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
THERE.
SHE DID A VERY HEROIC THING AND

1140
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
PULLED TWO KIDS OUT OF THE HALL

1141
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
WAY AND SHOVED THEM IN THE CLASS

1142
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
AND LOCKED THE DOOR.

1143
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
THE KIDS ARE GOING TO SUFFER

1144
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
FROM THIS LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE.

1145
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
IT'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL EVENT THAT

1146
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
WILL TAKE TIME FOR HEALING.

1147
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
AS LONG AS EVERYONE GETS THE

1148
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
PROPER HELP, IT'S NOT SOMETHING

1149
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
YOU SHAKE OFF EASILY AND NOT FOR

1150
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
LITTLE PEOPLE.

1151
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
WE LOST A LOT OF BABIES TODAY IN

1152
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
THIS TOWN.

1153
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
THERE A LOT OF VERY SAD

1154
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
FAMILIES.

1155
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
AS EVERYONE CAN THINK, YOU NEVER

1156
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT

1157
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
BASICALLY IT HAPPENS ALL OVER

1158
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
THE WORLD AT THIS POINT.

1159
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF

1160
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
MENTAL HEALTH AND COG ZANDT OF

1161
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
GUN CONTROL IN MY EYES.

1162
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
TO TAKE YOUR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL,

1163
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SOMEONE

1164
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
BLOWING THEM ALL UP.

1165
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
IT'S VERY, VERY UNFORTUNATE, BUT

1166
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S OUR REALITY

1167
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
THESE DAYS.

1168
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
.
>> DENISE, I'M SORRY THAT THAT

1169
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
REALITY WAS VISITED UPON YOUR

1170
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
DAUGHTER TODAY AND EVERYBODY

1171
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
ELSE.
I WISH YOU STRENGTH AND PEACE IN

1172
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
THE DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD.
THANK YOU FOR TALKING TONIGHT.

1173
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, ANDERSON.

1174
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
>> OBVIOUSLY WITNESSING THE

1175
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
MASSACRE IN THE SCHOOL HAS

1176
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
BEEN -- HOW CAN YOU SAY

1177
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
OBVIOUSLY, DEEMLY TRAUMATIC

1178
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
EXPERIENCE FOR THOSE WHO

1179
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
SURVIVED AND HEARING ABOUT IT IN

1180
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE

1181
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
WORLD.

1182
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO

1183
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
UNDERSTAND.
THEY HAVE QUESTIONS AND PARENTS

1184
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT TO

1185
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
SAY.
WE WILL TALK WITH SANJAY GUPTA

1186
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
AHEAD.

1187
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
[ sniffs ] I HAVE A COLD.

1188
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
[ sniffs ] I TOOK DAYQUIL
BUT MY NOSE IS STILL RUNNY.

1189
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
[ Male Announcer ] TRUTH IS,
DAYQUIL DOESN'T TREAT THAT.

1190
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
REALLY?
[ Male Announcer ]
Alka-Seltzer Plus

1191
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
FIGHTS YOUR WORST
COLD SYMPTOMS,

1192
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
PLUS IT RELIEVES
YOUR RUNNY NOSE.

1193
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
[ breathes deeply ]
AWESOME.

1194
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
[ Male Announcer ]
YES, IT IS.

1195
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
THAT'S THE COLD TRUTH!

1196
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
>>> I WAS IN NEW YORK AND MY

1197
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
WIFE CALLED ME IN HYSTERICS.

1198
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I RUSHED HOME AND SHE HEARD SOME

1199
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
BANGS AND SHE WAS BROUGHT INTO A

1200
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
BATHROOM.
>> IT WAS FRIGHTENING.

1201
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
MY HEART STOPPED BEATING AND I

1202
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN IT.

1203
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
>> ONE OF THE MOST HORRIFIC

1204
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
IMAGES AFTER THE SHOOTING THAT

1205
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
OCCURRED WAS PARENTS AWAITING IN

1206
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
THE FIREHOUSE FOR WORD OF THEIR

1207
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
CHILDREN.
MANY WAITING FOR HOURS AND

1208
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
FINALLY BEING TOLD THAT IF THEY

1209
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
HADN'T HAD WORD BY THEN, THEIR

1210
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
LITTLE ONES WERE LOST.

1211
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
SO MANY FAMILIES TONIGHT IN DEEP

1212
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
MOURNING.

1213
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
UNSPEAKABLE GRIEF.

1214
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
SOLEDAD IS LIVE ON THE SCENE.

1215
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
SOLEDAD?

1216
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
GUNMAN'S MOTHER IS A

1217

KINDERGARTEN TEACHER AT THE

1218
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
SCHOOL FOUND DEAD AT THE FAMILY

1219
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
HOME NOT FAR FROM WHERE I AM.

1220
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
ALI IS COVERING THAT PART OF THE

1221
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
STORY FOR US.

1222
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
>> Reporter: WE ARE ON THE

1223
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
STREET WHERE THE SHOOTER LIVED

1224
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
WITH HIS MOTHER.

1225
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
THERE IS A LOT OF ACTIVITY

1226
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
AROUND HERE WHERE THAT POLICE

1227
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
CAR IS.

1228
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
NONE HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE

1229
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
RESIDENTS.
MANY OF THE RESIDENTS WERE ASKED

1230
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
TO LEAVE EARLIER TODAY WHILE THE

1231
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
POLICE MADE THIS A CRIME SCENE.

1232
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
YOU CAN SEE THE YELLOW TAPE.

1233
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
THE CARS AND THERE WERE A COUPLE

1234
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
OF REPORTERS HERE A MOMENT AGO.

1235
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
ALL MEDIA ARE TRYING TO GET TO

1236
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
THE HOUSE DOWN THERE.

1237
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
THE POLICE HAVE CLOSED THIS OFF.

1238
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
THESE ARE LARGE HOUSES AROUND

1239
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
HERE AND ALL OF THEM HAVE

1240
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS AND IT'S A

1241
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD.
NO STREET LIGHTS AT ALL.

1242
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
ALL THE LIGHTS YOU SEE HERE ARE

1243
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
FROM THE MEDIA.

1244
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
NOT A LOT OF NEIGHBORS

1245
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
RESPONDING AND THE REPORTERS ARE

1246
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF THE

1247
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
FAMILY AND WHO THEY WERE.

1248
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
WE HAVE SEEN PEOPLE LOOKING OUT

1249
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
THEIR WINDOWS AND THERE FAMILIES

1250
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
BACK IN.

1251
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
THERE IS A VERY QUIET

1252
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.
ABOUT 2 1/2 MILES FROM THE

1253
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
SCHOOL AND AROUND HERE PEOPLE

1254
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
WHO DID SPEAK TO THE MEDIA OR

1255
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
DID COMMENT ON THIS SAID THEY

1256
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
DIDN'T KNOW THE FAMILY.

1257
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THEY ARE

1258
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
NOW COMING TOGETHER IN THEIR

1259
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
GRIEF AND TRYING TO MAKE SENSE

1260
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
OF THIS.

1261
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
THIS IS ABOUT THE MOST UNCOMMON

1262
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
THING YOU WOULD SEE IN A

1263
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE THIS.

1264
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
NO REAL ACTION HERE.

1265
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
THE POLICE SAID THEY WON'T HAVE

1266
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
MORE COMMENTS UNTIL 8:00 IN THE

1267
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
MORNING EASTERN TIME WHICH IS

1268
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
WHEN THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE

1269
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION FOR

1270
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
THE SHOOTER.

1271
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET.

1272
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
AT LEAST THERE IS A SENSE THAT

1273
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
ONCE THEY DO THAT, THEY MAY BE

1274
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
ABLE TO PUT MORE OF THE PUZZLE

1275
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
PIECESING TO TOGETHER.

1276
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
YOU CAN SEE NO LIGHTS AND JUST

1277
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
THAT POLICE CAR MAKING SURE NO

1278
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
ONE GOES NEAR THAT HOUSE.

1279
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
>> THANK YOU FOR THAT UPDATE.

1280
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
THERE IS ANOTHER TERRIBLE PIECE

1281
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
OF THE PUZZLE TO TALK ABOUT

1282
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
TONIGHT.

1283
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
IT IS THE GUNMAN'S BROTHER WHO

1284
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
WAS TAKEN IN FOR QUESTIONING IN

1285
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY.

1286
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
LIVE FOR US IN HOBOKEN WITH

1287
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
MORE.
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT EXACTLY

1288
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
WHY THE BROTHER WAS TAKEN IN?

1289
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
>> THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF

1290
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
CONFUSION ABOUT THE BROTHER AND

1291
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
WHY HE WAS TAKEN IN.

1292
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
HE IS 24 YEARS OLD AND THE

1293
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
BROTHER LIVES IN AN APARTMENT

1294
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
BEHIND ME.

1295
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
A FIVE-STORY BUILDING MADE UP OF

1296
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
TWO AND THREE-BEDROOM

1297
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
APARTMENTS.

1298
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
THEY LED HIM INTO A POLICE CAR

1299
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
IN HANDCUFFS AND LOOKING DAZED

1300
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
AND A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED AND

1301
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
VERY, VERY GLUM WHICH YOU CAN

1302
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
IMAGINE IS UNDERSTANDABLE GIVEN

1303
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
THE SITUATION.

1304
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
NOT CLEAR EXACTLY WHY.

1305
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I DID TALK TO A POLICE OFFICER

1306
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
AS I WAS WALKING ON THE SCENE

1307
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
WHO SAID THERE WAS THIS NOTION

1308
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
THAT THE SHOOTING SUSPECT HAD

1309
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
HIS BROTHER'S ID ON HIM AND

1310
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
HOLDING HIS BROTHER'S ID FOR

1311
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
SOME REASON AND THERE MAY HAVE

1312
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
BEEN INITIAL CONFUSION AND

1313
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
POLICE TOOK THE BROTHER INTO

1314
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
CUSTODY AND CNN LEARNED AND WE

1315
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
HAVE BEEN TALKING TO TWO

1316
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
ROOMMATES OF THE BROTHER WHO ARE

1317
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
NOT BELIEVED TO HAVE A
CONNECTION TO THE SUSPECT AT

1318
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
ALL.
ON THE SCENE WHERE I WAS

1319
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
EARLIER, IT IS TEAMING WITH LAW

1320
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY.

1321
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
JERSEY CITY POLICE AND A BOMB

1322
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
SQUAD THAT NEVER REALLY ENTERED

1323
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
THE BUILDING AND THE FBI.

1324
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
THEY DID REMOVE SOME COLORS FROM

1325
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
THE APARTMENT.

1326
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
APPARENTLY A COMPUTER.
WE ARE NOT SURE IF HE IS STILL

1327
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
IN CUSTODY OR NOT.

1328
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
IT HAS BEEN A STRANGE SITUATION.

1329
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
IT IS VERY, VERY QUIET HERE AND

1330
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
ALMOST NO LAW ENFORCEMENT

1331
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
PRESENCE AT ALL.

1332
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
THAT DOES GIVE YOU A SENSE THAT

1333
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
THIS IS NO LONGER A HUGE STORY

1334
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
OF INTEREST IN THE

1335
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
INVESTIGATION.

1336
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
SOLEDAD?

1337
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
>> Reporter: THANKS, JOHN FOR

1338
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
THAT UPDATE.
BACK TO ANDERSON.

1339
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
>> SOLEDAD, THANKS.

1340
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
EVERYONE WHO LIVED THROUGH THE

1341
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
SHOOTING SAW AND HEARD THINGS

1342
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
THAT NO ONE EVER SHOULD,

1343
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
ESPECIALLY KIDS.

1344
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
AS PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID, THEIR

1345
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
INNOCENCE WAS TORN AWAY.

1346
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING

1347
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
HOW THE KIDS CAN BE AFFECTED BY

1348
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
WHAT THEY WITNESSED.

1349
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW AS

1350
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
PARENT WHAT IS TO SAY TO THEIR

1351
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
KID WHO IS WERE WATCHING OR MAY

1352
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT.

1353
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
SANJAY GUPTA JOINS ME NOW.

1354
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BIGGEST

1355
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
CONCERNS ARE FOR CHILDREN WHO

1356
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
WITNESSED THE SHOOTINGS OR WERE

1357
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
IN THE SCHOOL WHEN THIS

1358
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
HAPPENED?

1359
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
>> CHILDREN CAN SUFFER PTSD AS

1360
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
WELL, POST TRAUMATIC STRESS

1361
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
DISORDER AND WE DON'T THINK

1362
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
ABOUT IT AS MUCH.

1363
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
THIS IS SO UNPRECEDENTED IT'S

1364
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
HARD TO HAVE ANSWERS.

1365
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS, THERE

1366
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
WILL BE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT

1367
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
THESE KIDS.

1368
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
TYPICALLY IT'S SHORT-LIVED.

1369
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS.

1370
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
SOMETIMES IT CAN PROCEED TO

1371
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
NIGHTMARES AND ANXIETY AND

1372
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
PANIC.

1373
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET HELP

1374
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
EARLY.
IF YOU GET HELP EARLY, IT'S MUCH

1375
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
MORE PREDICTIVE OF HOW THEY DO

1376
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
IN THE LONG RUN.

1377
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
THERE A LOT OF STUDIES AND ONE

1378
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
THING I FOUND INTERESTING AND IT

1379
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
HAS TO DO WITH TONIGHT.

1380
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
THAT IS SLEEP.

1381
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
IF A CHILD IS GETTING SLEEP

1382
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
TONIGHT, IT TENDS TO BE A

1383
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
POWERFUL PREDICTOR OF HOW THEY

1384
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
WILL COPE.

1385
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
KIDS THAT WILL BE THE MOST

1386
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
VULNERABLE ARE KIDS WHO ARE

1387
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
CLOSER TO THE VIOLENCE AND HAD

1388
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
THINGS GOING ON IN THEIR OWN

1389
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
HOMES AHEAD OF TIME MAKES THEM

1390
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
MORE AT RISK.

1391
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
DON'T FORGET SOMETHING THAT YOU

1392
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT.

1393
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
SURVIVOR'S GUILT.

1394
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
KIDS WHO ARE ALIVE AND WONDER

1395
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
WHY THEY ARE.

1396
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE

1397
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
WILL BE MINDFUL OF.

1398
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
>> IT'S NOT THE IMMEDIATE TRAUMA

1399
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
OF HEARING OR WITNESSING THIS,

1400
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
BUT THE LONG-TERM LOSS OF SOME

1401
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
OF THE THEIR FRIENDS AND

1402
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
PLAYMATES AND AT THAT AGE,

1403
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
THAT'S A HARD THING TO

1404
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
UNDERSTAND.
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

1405
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
COUNSELLORS WILL BE AVAILABLE

1406
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
STARTING TOMORROW, ARE KIDS MORE

1407
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
AT RISK OF SUFFERING PTSD THAN

1408
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
ADULTS?

1409
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
>> BOTH CAN SUFFER, BUT THE

1410
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
DIFFERENCE IS THAT WITH CHILDREN

1411
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
AS YOUNG AS THIS, THEY DON'T

1412
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
VERBALIZE IT THE SAME WAY.

1413
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
YOU MAY HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL

1414
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
DELAYS THAT ARE UNUSUAL.

1415
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
YOU COULD HAVE REGRESSION

1416
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
OVERALL AND TEMPER TANTRUMS.

1417
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
THERE'S THE THINGS THAT MAY NOT

1418
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
FIT EXACTLY WITH WHAT YOU EXPECT

1419
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
WITH PTSD, BUT IT CAN BE MORE

1420
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
VAGUE.

1421
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
WITH ADULTS, HYPER VIGILANCE AND

1422
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
QUICK REACTIONS TO THINGS AND

1423
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
RELIVING THE TRAUMA AND THE

1424
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
HORROR OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

1425
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
OBVIOUSLY OF COURSE THE PARENTS

1426
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
OF THE CHILDREN WHO DIED ARE AT

1427
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
MOST RISK FROM ALL OF THIS.

1428
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
>> SANJAY, APPRECIATE IT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1429

1436
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Oh yeah.

1437
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000

1440
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
See? Santa's okay.

1441
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Walk it off Santa.

00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL AREA.

1473
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
THE LAST PLACE YOU WOULD EXPECT

1474
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1475
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING TO

1476
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
A LOT OF FAMILIES.

1477
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
ASKING HOW THEY ARE DOING SOUNDS

1478
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
SO HOLLOW, BUT WHAT ARE PEOPLE

1479
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
SAYING?

1480
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
>> THEY ARE JUST STUNNED.

1481
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
PARENTS HAVE COMING AND BRINGING

1482
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
THEIR KIDS WITH THEM.

1483
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
THEY ARE STUNNED THAT THEY ARE

1484
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
SO BLESSED THEY SURVIVED AND

1485
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
CHILDREN SURVIVE AND THEY WERE

1486
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
ABLE TO DODGE A TERRIBLE THING

1487
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
AND YET THEY KNOW SO MANY

1488
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITY DID

1489
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
NOT HAVE CHILDREN WHO SURVIVED.

1490
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
INSIDE THE SCENE OF LAW

1491
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
ENFORCEMENT THAT IS BEING

1492
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
PROCESSED.

1493
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
THE PARENTS CANNOT BE WITH THEIR

1494
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
CHILDREN AND CAN NEVER BE.

1495
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
THERE IS A TERRIBLE HORROR

1496
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
BEHIND IT ALL.

1497
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
WHY AND WHAT DROVE THE SHOOTER

1498
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
TO DO THIS.

1499
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
SO MANY QUESTIONS NEED TO BE

1500
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
ANSWERED AND PROBABLY AS LAW

1501
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
ENFORCEMENT TOLD US WILL BE

1502
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
ANSWERED, IT JUST TAKES TIME.

1503
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
IT TAKES INVESTIGATION.

1504
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NO RELIEF TO

1505
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
ANYBODY HERE.

1506
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
>> THE IDEA THAT THE KIDS ARE

1507
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
STILL IN THERE.

1508
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
IT'S SUCH A HORRIBLE THING.

1509
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I APPRECIATE YOUR SENSITIVE

1510
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
REPORTING.
WE SAW A LIT OF IT AT THE TOP OF

1511
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
THE HOUR.

1512
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
THE VIGIL IN NEWTOWN,

1513
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
CONNECTICUT.
A COMMUNITY SHATTERED.

1514
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
THEY CANNOT HOLD ALL THE PEOPLE

1515
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
WHO WANT TO BE THERE AND SAY

1516
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
PRAYERS AND ADD THEIR HOPES AND

1517
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
THEIR REMEMBRANCES FOR THE

1518
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
FAMILY WHO IS LOST LOVED ONES.

1519
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
WE ADD TO THAT VIGIL OUR PRAYERS

1520
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
AND THOUGHTS TO THE PARENTS AND

1521
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND

1522
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
FRIENDS.

1523
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
SO MANY HEARTS ARE WITH YOU

1524
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
TONIGHT.

1525
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A

1526
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
LETTER FROM HIS HOLINESS, POPE

1527
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
BENEDICT XVI.
I WAS INFORMED OF THE SHOOTING

1528
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
AT HANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY IN

1529
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1530
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I CONVEY MY HEART FELT AND

1531
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
PRAYERS TO THE VICTIMS AND

1532
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
FAMILIES.

1533
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
TO ALL OF THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY

1534
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
OF NEWTOWN AND ESPECIALLY THE

1535
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
PARISH OF ST. ROSE OF LIMA.

1536
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
>> I HAVE NO WORDS THAT MAKE THE

1537
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
PAIN OF WHAT HAPPENED TODAY EASY

1538
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
TO BEAR.

1539
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I AM HEARTBROKEN AS I KNOW ALL

1540
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
OF YOU ARE.

1541
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
THERE IS NOTHING MORE HURTFUL

1542
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
AND TRAGIC THAN THE LOSS OF

1543
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
INNOCENCE, BUT NO
