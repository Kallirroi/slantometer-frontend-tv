00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM.

187
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
>> WE DEFINITELY REPRESENT

188
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
OURSELVES.

189
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
NOT EVEN EVERYONE IS ITALIAN ON

190
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
THE SHOW --

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
KATIE: RIGHT, YOU'RE SPANISH --

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
>> I'M SPANISH AND IRISH.

193
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
>> MY FAMILY IS BORN IN SICILY

194
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
AND THEY LOVE IT.

195
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
WE JUST REPRESENT OURSELVES.

196
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?
WE WENT TO ITALY AND THE

197
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
ITALIANS WERE NICER TO US THAN

198
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
THE AMERICANS IN ITALY.

199
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
SO IT'S CRAZY.

200
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
KATIE: IS THERE ANYTHING

201
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
SPECIFIC THAT YOU GUYS REGRET

202
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
THAT SORT OF COME TO MIND?

203
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
>> THERE'S A LOT OF CRAZY STUFF

204
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I REGRET.

205
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
>> WE LEARN FROM IT.
>> HONESTLY I CAN SAY PROBABLY

206
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US GREW FROM

207
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
BEING ON THE SHOW.

208
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
YEAH, OF COURSE I REGRET NOT

209
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
WEARING UNDERWEAR.

210
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
REGRETS.  OF

[LAUGHTER]

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
BUT, I MEAN, NOW I KNOW TO WEAR

213
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
UNDERWEAR ALL THE TIME.

214
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000

215
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
KATIE: I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.

216
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW THINGS HAVE

217
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
CHANGED.

218
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
MIKE, YOU JUST GOT OUT OF REHAB,

219
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
SO YOU WENT THROUGH A TOUGH

220
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
PERIOD.

221
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
HOW ARE YOU DOING AND HOW WAS

222
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
THAT EXPERIENCE FOR YOU?

223
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
>> I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT

224
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
EXPERIENCE WAS PROBABLY THE MOST

225
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE,

226
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
OR I THINK IN ONE'S LIFE.

227
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY HARD

228
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
TO HAVE A CLEAN LIFE STYLE AND

229
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
TO BE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, SORT

230
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
OF A MORE PARTY ENVIRONMENT,

231
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
RIGHT?
>> LIKE I SAID, IT WAS EXTREMELY

232
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
HARD, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ONE

233
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
DRINK, ONE CIGARETTE.

234
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I WAS ABLE TO RECOVER, GO

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
THROUGH REHAB, COMPLETE IT AND I

236
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000

I MEAN, THIS IS WHAT EVERYONE

252
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000

I'M SORRY, I KNOW THAT'S SORT OF

298
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
BAD TASTE TO MENTION MONEY, BUT

299
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I MEAN, I THINK IT'S PRETTY

300
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
REMARKABLE.

730
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
TWEET, RIGHT?

731
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
>> WHEN I CAN'T SLEEP I'LL BE ON

732
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
TWITTER.

733
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
KATIE: I DO THAT TOO.

734
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY THING

735
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
YOU CAN DO BECAUSE NO ONE'S

736
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
CALLING YOU, EMAILING YOU, I

737
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
GUESS I'LL CHECK OUT TWITTER.

738
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
>> MY STAFF TEASES ME.

739
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
BUT THE REALITY IS I GO BACK AND

740
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
FORTH TRY TO RESPOND TO PEOPLE.

741
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
BUT A YOUNG WOMAN SAID TO ME,

742
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
JUST THAT SHE DIDN'T THINK IT

743
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
WAS GOVERNMENT'S ROLE TO PROVIDE

744
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
NUTRITION.

745
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
AND I ACTUALLY DISAGREE WITH

746
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
THAT, BEING THAT I KNOW MANY

747
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
GREAT AMERICANS WHO AT DIFFERENT

748
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
TIMES IN THEIR LIVES, ESPECIALLY

749
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
THEIR CHILDHOOD HAD TO RELY ON

750
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
HELP AND SUPPORT.

751
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
SO I JUST SAID TO HER, THINKING

752
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
IT WAS A THROWAWAY COMMENT,

753
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
LET'S DO THIS FOOD STAMP

754
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
CHALLENGE.
I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND

755
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
IT HAD SPREAD AND I CALLED MY

756
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
STAFF.
WHO WASN'T EXPECTING THIS, AND I

757
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
SAID GUESS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

758
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
BE DOING FOR THE NEXT WEEK.

759
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
KATIE: YOU DECIDED YOU WERE

760
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
GOING TO TAKE $30 FOR A WEEK,

761
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
WHICH WOULD COME TO ABOUT $4 A

762
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
DAY TO EAT FOR THE ENTIRE DAY,

763
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
AND FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK.

764
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
YOU WENT TO THE GROCERY STORE

765
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
WITH $30.

766
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
>> YES.

767
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
AND I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GOING

768
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
TO BREAK DOWN TO A $1.40 A MEAL.

769
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
THIS WAS A GOOD EXPERIENCE FOR

770
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
ME TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT THINGS I

771
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
SEE EVERY DAY BECAUSE ALL MY

772
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
STORES, I OFTEN SEE PEOPLE USING

773
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
FOOD STAMPS OR SNAP.

774
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
KATIE: I KNOW THAT YOU

775
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
BASICALLY, YOU RECORDED SORT OF

776
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
EVERY MEAL AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT

777
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
YOU WERE EATING, AND OBVIOUSLY

778
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
COMMUNICATED WITH YOUR TWITTER

779
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
FOLLOWERS, AND KEPT A VIDEO

780
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
DIARY EACH DAY.
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

781
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
>> SO I'M HAPPY TO BE SITTING

782
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
HERE WITH A REALLY GOOD MEAL,

783
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
ACTUALLY TASTES REALLY GOOD, A

784
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
NICE SALAD WITH RICE AND BEANS.

785
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND NOW,

786
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
CLEARLY ALREADY THAT I HAVE A
PUT A LOT OF FORETHOUGHT INTO MY

787
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
DAY'S OVER THIS WEEK ABOUT HOW

788
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I'M GOING TO MANAGE MY MEALS.

789
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
KATIE: SO WAS IT HARDER, CORY,

790
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THAN YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TO

791
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
EAT ON THIS BUDGET?

792
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
>> A LOT HARDER.

793
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
IT BECAME EVERY DAY REALIZING

794
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
HOW MUCH I TAKE FOR GRANTED.

795
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
LOOK, I JUST GRAB AND GO AND

796
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

797
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
WHEN I REALIZE A CUP OF

798
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
STARBUCKS COFFEE WOULD BE AS

799
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
MUCH AS MY MEAL ALLOCATION, I

800
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
COULDN'T DO IT.
I HAD TO PUT A LOT OF

801
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
FORETHOUGHT, A LOT OF PLANNING.

802
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
AND JUST THINGS I DON'T DO

803
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
REGULARLY, WHICH IS COOKING SOME

804
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
MEALS, AND PREPARING FOOD.

805
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
SO IT WAS MUCH MORE CHALLENGING

806
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
THAN I EVEN THOUGHT.

807
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
KATIE: YOU GAVE UP COFFEE

808
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
BECAUSE IT WAS AN EXPENSE YOU

809
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
COULDN'T AFFORD.

810
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
THAT WAS TOUGH, HUH?

811
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
>> IT WAS PAINFUL.
QUITE LITERALLY, I GOT CAFFEINE

812
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
WITHDRAWALS, HEADACHES.

813
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I WAS A BIT OF A GRUMPY GUY.

814
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
KATIE: I BET.

815
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
SHOW US, YOU BROUGHT SOME OF THE

816
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
THINGS YOU WOULD BUY.

817
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU BOUGHT

818
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
LETTUCE IN A BAG, BECAUSE THAT'S

819
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
PRETTY EXPENSIVE.

820
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, AGAIN, HAVING

821
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
TWITTER, I GOT SO MUCH FEEDBACK

822
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
FROM PEOPLE CRITICIZING MY

823
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
SHOPPING CHOICES.

824
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I WISH I HAD SPENT THE TWO,

825
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
THREE WEEKS LISTENING TO ADVICE

826
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
BECAUSE I MADE MISTAKES.

827
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
BUT THIS WAS ON SALE, SO IT WAS

828
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
A LOT CHEAPER THAN PEOPLE THINK.

829
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
THE SWEET POTATOS, MY GREATEST

830
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
DISCOVERY FROM THIS.

831
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
BECAUSE I USUALLY ONLY HAVE THEM

832
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
WHEN MY MOM PREPARES THEM ON

833
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
CHRISTMAS OR THANKSGIVING.

834
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH SWEET

835
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
POTATOS, BUT THEY WERE SO MUCH
CHEAPER, I THINK THEY WERE .69.

836
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
KATIE: VERY FILLING.

837
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
>> VERY FILLING.

838
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
THE FROZEN VEGETABLES WERE ON

839
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
SALE, CHEAPER THAN FRESH

840
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
VEGETABLES WHICH WAS INTERESTING

841
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
TO ME THIS WAS THE POWER, THE

842
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
CANNED FOOD, WHICH I GOT A LOT

843
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
OF CRITICISM FOR.

844
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
WHEN I JUST COMPARED THE PRICE

845
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
VERSUS FRESH FOOD OR BEANS, IT

846
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
WAS SO MUCH CHEAPER, THE UNIT

847
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
COST WAS SO MUCH CHEAPER.

848
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
KATIE: IN A CAN.

849
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
>> IN A CAN.

850
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
BUT INTERESTINGLY WHAT PEOPLE

851
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
WHO COOK WERE TELLING ME, WHEN

852
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
THEY SOAK THE BEANS, IT ABSORBS

853
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
A LOT OF WATER, AND YOU CAN TAKE

854
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
THAT INTO ACCOUNT.

855
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
KATIE: YOU COULD SPRETCH THE

856
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
BEANS MUCH FURTHER IF YOU BOUGHT

857
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
DRIED BEANS.

858
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
>> I GOT A LOT OF GREAT INSULTS

859
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
OVER TWITTER.
YOU MAY BE A RHODES SCHOLAR BUT

860
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT COOKING.
KATIE: THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF

861
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
TWITTER, OR NOT.

862
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
>> I GOT SCHOOLED BY A LOT OF

863
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
FOLKS.

864
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
KATIE: WHAT OTHER ADVICE DID YOU

865
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
GET FROM PEOPLE IN SOCIAL MEDIA?

866
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
BECAUSE I IMAGINE A LOT OF

867
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO LIVE THIS

868
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
WAY, OR YOU KNOW, HAVE A LOT OF

869
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
KNOWLEDGE OF THIS.

870
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
>> WELL, AGAIN, A LOT OF MOMENTS

871
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
TO MAKE LIGHT OF MY INABILITY TO

872
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
SHOP AND DO THINGS, BUT THE

873
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
REALITY IS THIS IS SOMETHING

874
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
PEOPLE DEAL WITH EVERY SINGLE

875
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
DAY.
THEY DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF

876
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
KNOWING IN ONE WEEK I'M DONE

877
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
WITH THIS.
MY MODEST BRUSH WITH WHAT 46

878
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
MILLION PLUS AMERICANS, BECAUSE

879
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
THERE ARE 46 MILLION AMERICANS

880
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
WHO SNUSE SNAP, BUT THERE ARE

881
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
MANY MORE AMERICANS WHO EVERY

882
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
DAY HAVE DIFFICULT CHOICES.

883
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
GO GROCERY SHOPPING OR PAY THE

884
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
MORTGAGE.

885
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
MAKE THE CAR PAYMENT OR BUY MY

886
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
CHILD A TOY.

887
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
SO WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN NEWARK IN

888
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
THE LAST FOUR YEARS, DURING THE

889
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
RECESSION, IS OUR FOOD PANTRIES

890
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
HAVE BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH

891
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
DEMAND.
AND THIS IS SOMETHING I'M HOPING

892
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS.

893
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT ONE

894
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
PROGRAM SNAP, IT'S REALLY ABOUT

895
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
FOOD JUSTICE, ENDING FOOD

896
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
INSECURITY IN THE UNITED STATES

897
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
OF AMERICA, WHICH WE HAVE THE

898
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
POWER TO DO.

899
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
AND SO WE CAN DO THINGS ON A

900
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
LOCAL LEVEL.

901
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
FARMERS MARKETS, FOOD STAMPS,

902
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
URBAN GARDENS, SUPPORTING OUR

903
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
FOOD PANTRIES, MAKING SURE THOSE

904
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
URBAN GARDENS AND FARMERS MARKET

905
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
ACCEPT FAMILY FIRST CARDS,

906
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
BECAUSE MANY DON'T.

907
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
KATIE: WHEN WE COME BACK WE'RE

908
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
ACTUALLY GOING TO TALK MORE

909
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
ABOUT THESE TWO KIND OF

910
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
CONFLICTING ISSUES THAT ARE

911
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
FACING AMERICANS, IRONICALLY,

912
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
HUNGER AND OBESITY, THAT'S RIGHT

FINISHED HIS FOOD STAMP

CHALLENGE.

936
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I NOTICED, CORY, IN YOUR DISPLAY

937
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
THAT YOU ONLY COULD AFFORD TWO

938
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
APPLES FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK.

939
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
>> RIGHT, FRESH FRUIT WAS SO

940
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
EXPENSIVE.

941
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I HAD TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS

942
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
AND I LOVE APPLES AND I COULDN'T

943
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
AFFORD THAT MANY OF THEM.

944
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
KATIE: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

945
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
OBESITY IN AMERICA AND WHAT

946
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
PEOPLE AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF

947
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
THE SOCIOECONOMIC LAD RER DOING,

948
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000

00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
HEALTH YEAR AND MAKE BETTER FOOD

950
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
CHOICES AND MAKE BETTER FOOD

951
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
AVAILABLE?
>> FOOD INSECURITY, OBESITY, ALL

952
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
FROM THE SAME ORIGINS.

953
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
BUT YOU HAVE LOW INCOME

954
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
COMMUNITIES AND MANY PEOPLE WHO
ARE WORKING, THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE

955
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
DON'T UNDERSTAND.
MANY PEOPLE ON SNAP ARE WORKING

956
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
FULL-TIME JOBS.
KATIE: SOMETIMES TWO JOBS.

957
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
>> AND STILL NOT MAKING ENOUGH

958
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
MONEY.
THEY'RE OFTEN TRAPPED IN THE USE

959
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
OF EARLIER FOOD DESERTS, THEY

960
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO FOOD.

961
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
WE'VE CREATED THE GRANT PROGRAM

962
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
TO GET THEM REFRIGERATED UNITS.

963
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
WE GOT THE FIRST IN THE CENTER

964
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
OF OUR CITY CALLED CENTRAL WARD,

965
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
OPENED UP THE FIRST NEW

966
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
SUPERMARKET IN 20 YEARS.

967
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
WE'RE DOING A LOT OF PRACTICAL

968
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
THINGS TO OPEN AND EXPAND

969
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
THROUGH FARMERS MARKET.

970
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
KATIE: IT IS TIME CONSUMING TO

971
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
BE ABLE TO EAT IN A HEALTHY WAY.

972
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
>> I FOUND MYSELF EATING THE

973
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

974
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
BEANS AND CORN, BEANS AND PEAS

975
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
AND I HAD A CRAVING FOR ICE

976
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
CREAM AND I GOT A TWEET BY

977
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
SOMEONE ANGRYLY, I SAW SOMEONE

978
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
BUYING FOOD ON STAMPS AND THEY

979
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
HAD X FOOD.

980
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
YOU WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE A
VARIETY OF FOODS.

981
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
WE HAVE TO WORK IN ALL OUR

982
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE

983
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHY,

984
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
NUTRITION FOODS.

985
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
KATIE: OBVIOUSLY OBESITY IS A

986
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
HUGE ISSUE FOR CHILDREN AND

987
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
ADULTS, BUT SIMULTANEOUSLY WE

988
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
HAVE A BIG ISSUE WITH PEOPLE

989
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
BEING HUNGRY IN THIS COUNTRY

990
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
THAT I THINK MANY PEOPLE DON'T

991
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
REALLY APPRECIATE OR UNDERSTAND.

992
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
>> I LOVE THE TERM FOOD

993
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
INSECURITY AND NOT KNOWING WHERE

994
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
YOUR NEXT MEAL COMES FROM,

995
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
HAVING THIS PAIN OF

996
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE BARELY

997
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
GOING TO MAKE YOUR RENT PAYMENT

998
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
IF YOU DO, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

999
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
BE ABLE TO AFFORD FOOD.

1000
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
THE PAIN YOU FEEL WALKING

1001
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
THROUGH A SHOPPING CENTER WITH A

1002
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
CHILD, TWO POINTS TO FOOD THEY

1003
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
WANT AND YOU KNOW THERE'S NO WAY

1004
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

1005
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
AFFORD TO GIVE THEM WHAT YOU

1006
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
WANT.

1007
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
KATIE: HOW DO YOU TACKLE ISSUES

1008
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
SIMULTANEOUSLY, IT'S TRICKY

1009
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
ISN'T IT?

1010
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
>> IT IS TRICKY.

1011
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
SEVEN YEARS NOW I'VE BEEN THE

1012
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
MAYOR OF NEWARK.

1013
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
GOING THROUGH THIS WONDERFUL

1014
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
TRANSFORMATION.
MY METAPHOR USED TO BE I WAS A

1015
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
PRISONER OF HOPE.

1016
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
NOW MY METAPHOR OF LIFE IS I'M

1017
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
HOPE UNHINGED BECAUSE I KNOW

1018
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
WHEN MY COMMUNITY, IN NEW

1019
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
JERSEY, WHEN AMERICA FOCUSES ON

1020
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
ISSUES, REALLY FOCUSES ON THEM.

1021
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
WE CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS.

1022
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
SO I'M ONE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT

1023
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
STILL BELIEVE YOU CAN BANISH

1024
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
THIS IF WE ALL TOOK

1025
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
RESPONSIBILITY FROM IT.

1026
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
MOST OF US, IF WE LOOK INTO OUR

1027
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
AN AN ZESTRY, THERE WERE PEOPLE

1028
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
THAT WERE POOR, BENEFITTED FROM

1029
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
THE LOVE, COMPASSION OF OTHERS.

1030
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
THAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY, THE

1031
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
ONLY WAY WE CAN PAY BACK WHAT

1032
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
WILL HAPPEN FOR MY GRANDMOTHER,

1033
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
WHAT HAPPENED FOR MY FATHER WHO

1034
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
WAS BORN TO A POOR, SINNLE

1035
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
MOTHER.

1036
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
WE JUST NEEDED ACTIVISM THAT

1037
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
STEMS FROM A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT

1038
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY

1039
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
WHO ARE STRUGGLING IN SILENCE,

1040
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITHOUT THE

1041
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
LIGHT AND ATTENTION THAT IT

1042
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
REALLY DESERVES.

1043
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
IF WE GAVE IT, WE COULD DISPEL

1044
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
THE DARKNESS THAT AFFECTS TOO

1045
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
MANY OF US.

1046
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
KATIE: WHAT ABOUT EXPANDING YOUR

1047
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
ROLE?

1048
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

1049
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
SPECULATION THAT YOU MADE RUN

1050
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
FOR GOVERNOR OF NG AND YOU'RE

1051
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
MAKING A DECISION ABOUT THAT IN

1052
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

1053
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
>> YEAH, IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO,

1054
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
TWO WEEKS, I'M GOING TO TAKE

1055
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
SOME TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S

1056
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
NEXT IN MY CAREER.

1057
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I'VE BEEN MAYOR NOW, IN MY

1058
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
SECOND TERM AND I'LL THINK HARD

1059
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
ABOUT RUNNING FOR THE UNITED

1060
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
STATES SENATE.
WE HAVE A GREAT SENATOR THERE,

1061
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
BUT HE MAY BE RETIRING, SO I'M

1062
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
GOING TO THINK HARD ABOUT THE

1063
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
SENATE SEAT AND COME OUT WITH A

1064
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
DECISION SOON.
BY THE WAY, AFTER I MAKE THAT

1065
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
DECISION, I THEN HAVE TO TURN TO

1066
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
THE VOTERS AND THEY HAVE TO

1067
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
DECIDE AM I WORTHY OF THEIR VOTE

1068
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
AND SUPPORT?
KATIE: YOU CAN SEE WHY KELLY IS

1069
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
SUCH AN EFFECTIVE POLITICIAN,

1070
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
LIKE SIGN ME UP.

1071
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T USE COUPONS

1072
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
WHEN YOU DID YOUR FOOD STAMP

1073
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
CHALLENGE.
BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, I KNOW

1074
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
YOU WISH YOU HAD.

1075
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
SO WE'VE GOT SOMEONE WHO CALLS

1076
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
HERSELF THE COUPON MOM WHO WILL

1077
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
SHOW US HOW TO GET MORE BANG FOR

1078
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
YOUR BUCK.

1079
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I THINK IT WILL BE HELPFUL FOR

1080
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
ANYBODY WHO'S SHOPPING ON A

1081
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
BUDGET.

1082
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
SO THAT'S RIGHT AFTER THIS.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

1084
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

1085
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
KATIE: OK, NOW THE QUESTION IS

1086
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
CAN WE REALLY EAT HEALTHY AND

1087
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
SAVE SOME MONEY?

1088
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
NEWARK MAYOR CORY BOOKER COULD

1089
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
HAVE USED A LESSON FROM

1090
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
STEPHANIE.
SHE MANAGES THE POPULAR WEBSITE

1091
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000

00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
SO IT'S AMAZING, ALL THIS FOR

1130
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
$120.

1131
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
BECAUSE WE SHOULD MENTION --

1132
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
>> OH, NO, IT WAS $98.

1133
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
OUR BUDGET WAS $120.

1134
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
KATIE: OH WOW, AND WE SHOULD

1135
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
MENTION $120 IS ABOUT THE

1136
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
ALLOTMENT YOU GET FOR A FAMILY

1137
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
OF FOUR ON FOOD STAMPS FOR A

1138
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
WEEK.

1139
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
SO, TELL US A LITTLE, SOME OF

1140
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
MORE OF YOUR TIPS IF YOU COULD

1141
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
STEPHANIE.
>> WELL THE NUMBER ONE IS YOU

1142
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN.

1143
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
SO THE KEY IS DON'T WALK INTO

1144
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
THE GROCERY STORE WITH A BUNCH

1145
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
OF MENUS TO GET INGREDIENTS.

1146
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
START WITH THAT STORE ADD AND

1147
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
SEE WHAT THE ROCK BOTTOM DEALS

1148
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
ARE AND MAKE YOUR MENU FOR THE

1149
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
WEEK BASED ON WHAT'S ON SALE.

1150
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
THAT WILL CUT YOUR COST

1151
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
DRAMATIC.
KATIE: CORY AND I WERE TALKING

1152
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
ABOUT THE FACT THAT A LOT OF

1153
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
PEOPLE ARE SO BUSY, WORKING

1154
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
HARD, TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF

1155
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
THEIR FAMILIES.

1156
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
SOMETIMES EVEN WORKING TWO JOBS.

1157
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
IT SEEMS TO ME, STEPHANIE, THAT

1158
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
ALL THE CUTTING AND CALCULATING

1159
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
CAN BE PRETTY STRESSFUL.

1160
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
HOW DO YOU REDUCE THAT?

1161
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
>> THERE ARE EASY RESOURCES

1162
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
ONLINE, COUPON MOM TELLS YOU

1163
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
WHAT THE DEALS ARE, TELLS YOU

1164
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
WHERE TO GET THE COUPONS, YOU

1165
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
CAN PRINT COUPONS.

1166
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
SO IF YOU CAN ALLOW HALF AN HOUR

1167
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
FOR PLANNING FOR YOUR GROCERY

1168
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
EACH WEEK, YOU CAN DO THIS.

1169
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH

1170
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
TIME, IF YOU WALK INTO THE

1171
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
GROCERY STORE AND PICK UP THE

1172
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
CIRCULAR, YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE

1173
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
25% JUST DOING THAT.

1174
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
KATIE: SO THIS IS REALLY DELUS

1175
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
210 WORTH OF FOOD THAT YOU GOT

1176
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
FOR $98.

1177
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1178
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
KATIE: USING COUPONS.

1179
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
WOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK CORY?

1180
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
>> I'M WONDERING IF I CAN GET

1181
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
SOME OF THIS AS A PARTING GIFT

1182
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
FOR GOING HOME.

1183
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
NO, THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY.

1184
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
KATIE: YOU SAID THE YOGURT COST

1185
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
HOW MUCH?

1186
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
>> .10.
WE EVEN HAVE GREEK YOGURT, WHICH

1187
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
DON'T WE JUST O LOVE THAT?

1188
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
KATIE: WOW.

1189
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
WHAT ARE OTHER TIPS YOU CAN GIVE

1190
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
US FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE FEEDING

1191
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
THEMSELVES OR A WHOLE FAMILY ON

1192
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
A BUDGET?

1193
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1194
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
WE TALKED ABOUT PLANNING, PLAN

1195
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
FOR LEFTOVERS SO YOU BUY THE

1196
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
VALUE PACK OF PORK CHOPS, HAVE

1197
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
ENOUGH FOR THE NEXT DAY FOR

1198
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
SANDWICHES.

1199
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE

1200
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
BRAND FLEXIBLE, BUY THE BRAND ON

1201
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
SALE OR THE STORE BRAND IF

1202
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
THAT'S NOT THE BEST DEAL.

1203
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
MAKE SURE YOU LOOK FOR COUPONS.

1204
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
YOU CAN GET THEM IN THE

1205
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000

FROM THE STORE CIRCULAR JUST

1209
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
WALKING IN.

1210
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
>> DO COUPONS WORK AT A LOCAL

1211
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
BODEGA?
>> IN MOST CASES YES, THEY'RE

1212
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
PROBABLY NOT GOING TO DOUBLE THE

1213
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
COUPON.
YOU TALKED ABOUT CHALLENGES WITH

1214
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
GOING TO SUPERMARKETS, SOME OF

1215
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
THE STRATEGIES WE TALKED ABOUT

1216
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
THAT DON'T INVOLVE COUPONS CAN

1217
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
SAVE YOU MONEY.

1218
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
IN TERMS OF BEING BRAND FLEXIBLE

1219
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
AND SOAKING PLANS.

1220
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
AND REALLY PLANNING.

1221
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
DID YOU KNOW 30% OF THE AVERAGE

1222
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
GROCERY BILL IS WASTED JUST BY

1223
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
NOT PLANNING FOR LEFTOVERS.

1224
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
BY TEACHING PEOPLE PLANNING, WE

1225
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
CAN HELP.

1226
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
>> I EAT TWO THIRDS OF IT, AND

1227
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
THEN IT GOES TO WASTE.

1228
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I THINK THERE'S A TREMENDOUS

1229
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
AMOUNT OF FOOD WASTE IN THIS

1230
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
COUNTRY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE PEOPLE

1231
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
PROBABLY AREN'T PLANNING, LIKE

1232
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
ME.
YOU MADE ME FEEL DUMB.

1233
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
[LAUGHTER]
KATIE: THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY

1234
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
MUCH TO A RHODES SCHOLAR SO WE

1235
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
FEEL FOR YOU.
>> NO, BUT THANK YOU.

1236
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

1237
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
>> WE'LL GET TOGETHER.

1238
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000

1239
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000

00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
STEPHANIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
BECAUSE IT REALLY OPENED MY

1242
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
EYES.
YOU SHOULD NEVER GO TO THE

1243
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
GROCERY STORE HUNGRY, RIGHT?

1244
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
>> OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

1245
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
KATIE: BECAUSE YOU MAKE BAD

1246
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
DECISIONS.
>> BUT TASTY DECISIONS.

1247
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
[LAUGHTER]

1248
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
KATIE: I KNOW CORY'S BIGGEST

1249
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
CHALLENGE DURING THIS WHOLE WEEK

1250
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
WAS WHEN YOU HAD TO HAVE A

1251
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
MEETING AT A BAKERY --

1252
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
>> YES.

1253
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
KATIE: WOW, WHO DID YOU TICK OFF

1254
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
THAT THEY HAD A MEETING IN A

1255
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
BAKERY?

1256
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
>> IT WAS A PREGNANT FRIEND OF

1257
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
MINE WHO WANTED TO UPDATE ME ON

1258
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
SOMETHINGS.

1259
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
SO I YIELDED TO HER BEING WITH

1260
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
CHILD AND HAVING A BIG APPETITE.

1261
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
KATIE: BUT YOU COULDN'T BUY

1262
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
ANYTHING?
>> I SAT THERE AND DRANK WATER

1263
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
AS I WATCHED HER ENJOY A MEAL.

1264
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
KATIE: YOU TWEETED SOMETHING?

1265
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000

00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
SCARFED DOWN PEACE AND CORN,

00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
PRETENDING IT WAS CHRISTMAS
