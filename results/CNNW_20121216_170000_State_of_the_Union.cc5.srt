1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
SEIZED.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
>> WITHOUT ELABORATING CAN YOU

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
SAY ARE THERE PIECES OF THE

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
PUZZLE MISSING THAT WILL MAKE

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
THIS MORE DIFFICULT TO TELL?

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
>> ARE THERE PIECES, YES,

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
MISSING, THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD A

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
CHANCE TO FINISH YET.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
THE FORENSIC PART IS AN

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
IMPORTANT PART.

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
THAT'S NOT DONE YET.

12
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
THAT'S BEING WORKED ON, BUT NOT

13
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
DONE YET.
THE WITNESSES THAT NEED TO BE

14
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
INTERVIEWED, THERE'S AN IMMENSE

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
NUMBER OF WITNESSES THAT NEED TO

16
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
BE INTERVIEWED.

17
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
THAT'S NOT COMPLETED THERE.

18
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
THERE ARE WEEK'S WORTH OF WORK

19
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
WE HAVE LEFT IN ORDER TO

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
COMPLETE THIS.
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS SAY

21
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
THAT WE WILL COME BACK IN A

22
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
COUPLE HOURS.
I APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING YOU OUT

23
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
HERE IN THE INCLEMENT WEATHER.

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
WE ARE ALSO.

25
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
BUT I WANT TO GET THE

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
INFORMATION FROM THE MEDICAL

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
EXAMINER'S OFFICE AND CONFIRM

28
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
THAT.

29
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I WANT TO GET -- SEE IF I CAN

30
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
GET MORE DETAIL RELATIVE TO THE

31
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
PRESIDENTIAL VISIT AND WHAT

32
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
LOGISTICS OF THAT WILL BE THIS

33
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
AFTERNOON AND ANY UPDATES THAT I

34
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
GET FROM THE MAJOR CRIME

35
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
COMMANDERS OF THE DEPARTMENT I

36
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
WILL BRING THAT BACK TO YOU.

37
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
>> CAN YOU SAY WHAT FEDERAL

38
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
CRIME IS BEING BROKEN BY THOSE

39
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
POSING ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

40
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
>> FEDERAL AUTHORITIES.

41
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I DON'T KNOW.

42
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
WE'LL BE BACK IN A COUPLE HOURS.

43
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
PLEASE STAY DRY.

44
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
>> SO THERE YOU HAVE IT.

45
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE

46
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
SPOKESMAN LIEUTENANT PAUL VANCE

47
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
UPDATING US.

48
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
SOLEDAD, VERY INTERESTING

49
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
DEVELOPMENT.

50
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
APPARENTLY ALL THESE FALSE

51
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
SOCIAL MEDIA REPORTS ALLEGEDLY

52
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
SUPPOSEDLY FROM THIS KILLER OUT

53
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
THERE AND THE WARNING FROM THIS

54
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
POLICE CHIEF, THE WARNING IS

55
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
SPECIFIC, WARNING BEING IF YOU

56
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
GET ENGAGED AND CIRCULATE THESE

57
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
FALSE REPORTS WITH THREATS OUT

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
THERE, YOU ARE VIOLATING THE LAW

59
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
AND THEY WILL GO AFTER YOU?

60
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
>> YEAH.
HE WAS TOUGH ON THAT.

61
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAID, WHILE

62
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
NOT SPECIFICALLY REFERENCING ANY

63
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
SPECIFIC SOCIAL MEDIA REPORTS,

64
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
HE SAID THAT THERE IS ERRONEOUS

65
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
INFORMATION COMING OUT, ALL

66
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
THEIR INFORMATION IS ON THEIR

67
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
OFFICIAL WEBSITE AND NOT TO

68
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
TRUST ANYTHING THAT WAS JUST

69
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
BEING REPEATED OR CREATED ON

70
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
SOCIAL MEDIA.

71
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
HIGHLIGHTING, OF COURSE, THAT

72
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
THERE HAD BEEN CONTRADICTORY

73
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
INFORMATION, JUST WRONG
INFORMATION.

74
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
VERY TOUGH ON THAT AS YOU HEARD

75
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
IN THAT PRESS CONFERENCE, WOLF?

76
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
>> YEAH.

77
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
BECAUSE SOME OF THESE SOCIAL

78
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
MEDIA SITES I'VE SEEN ONE OR TWO

79
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
OF THEM OVER THE PAST DAY OR SO,

80
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
AND THEY'RE MAKING THESE

81
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
ACCUSATIONS AND THESE THREATS

82
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
OUT THERE AND SCARE SOMETHING

83
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
FOLKS AND THESE ARE TOTALLY

84
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
OBVIOUSLY ERRONEOUS.

85
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
THE AUTHORITIES ARE GOING TO GO

86
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
AFTER THEM.
THE OTHER THING WE HEARD IS THAT

87
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
THEY'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT

88
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
KIDS GOING BACK TO SCHOOL

89
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
TOMORROW AND TRYING TO FIGURE

90
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
OUT HOW BEST TO DO THAT?

91
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
>> YEAH.
I THINK THAT'S BEEN A QUESTION

92
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
THAT ACTUALLY A LOT OF THE

93
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
PARENTS HERE HAVE HAD EVEN RIGHT

94
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
AFTER THIS HORRIBLE TRAGEDY

95
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
HAPPENED ON FRIDAY.

96
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I MEAN WHAT DO YOU DO?

97
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
THE SCHOOL IS A CRIME SCENE AND

98
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
EVEN WHEN IT'S NO LONGER A CRIME

99
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
SCENE, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

100
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCED AND

101
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
SEEN THE VERY WORST THINGS, HOW

102
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
COULD THEY POSSIBLY GO BACK TO

103
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
THEIR SCHOOL.
FOR THOSE WHO SURVIVED.

104
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
HOW COULD PARENTS BRING THEIR

105
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
CHILDREN BACK TO THIS SCHOOL.

106
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I THINK THERE'S SOME BIG

107
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
QUESTIONS THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE

108
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
TO ANSWER IN TERMS OF LOGISTICS

109
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
AND WHAT WILL THEY DO.

110
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
IT'S A SIMILAR QUESTION THEY HAD

111
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
AT COLUMBINE THAT THEY'VE HAD IN

112
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
THE PAST.

113
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
SO I'M SURE THEY'LL BE TRYING TO

114
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
FIGURE OUT HOW OTHERS HAVE DONE

115
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
IT AS THEY MOVE FORWARD IN

116
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
DEALING WITH YET ANOTHER SORT OF

117
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
ANGLE ON THIS TRAGEDY THAT THEY

118
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
HAVE TO CONFRONT HERE.

119
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
>> YEAH.

120
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I SUSPECT, YOU KNOW, JUST I

121
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
SUSPECT A LOT OF PARENTS WILL

122
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
SAY I'M GOING TO KEEP MY KID OR

123
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
KIDS HOME TOMORROW, THE NEXT

124
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
DAY, JUST OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF

125
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
PRECAUTION IF YOU WILL.

126
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
YOU CAN'T BLAME PEOPLE FOR BEING

127
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
NERVOUS GIVEN THE ENORMITY OF
THIS TRAGEDY.

128
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
THANKS VERY MUCH.

129
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE BACK,

130
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'M GOING TO BE BACK LATER BUT

131
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
OUR COVERAGE RIGHT NOW CONTINUES

132
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
WITH "STATE OF THE UNION WITH

133
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
CANDY CROWLEY."

134
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
>> GOOD AFTERNOON FOR THIS

135
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
SPECIAL EDITION OF STATE OF THE

136
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
UNION.
I'M CANDY CROWLEY.

137
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
MOMENTS AGO CONNECTICUT POLICE

138
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
WRAPPED UP A NEWS CONFERENCE AND

139
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
THEY SAID THERE HAS BEEN

140
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE

141
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
INVESTIGATION INCLUDING CLAIMS

142
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
OF QUOTES FROM THE GUNMAN.

143
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
CONNECTICUT'S GOVERNOR TOLD CNN

144
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
THE GUNMAN GOT INTO THE SCHOOL

145
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
BY USING HIS ASSAULT WEAPON TO

146
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
SHOOT HIS OWN ENTRANCE INTO THE

147
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
BUILDING.

148
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
CONNECTICUT'S MEDICAL EXAMINER

149
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
SAID THE RIFLE FOUND AT THE

150
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
SCENE FRIDAY WAS THE PRIMARY

151
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
WEAPON IN THE MASSACRE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL BE HERE IN

152
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
NEWTOWN IN A FEW HOURS AND MEET

153
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
WITH THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES AND

154
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
WILL SPEAK AT AN INTERFAITH

155
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
VIGIL AT 7:00 P.M. EASTERN.

156
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
JOINING ME NOW, TWO CONNECTICUT

157
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
LAWMAKERS RICHARD BLOOMENLE THAT

158
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
AND CONGRESSMAN AND

159
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
SENATOR-ELECT CHRIS MURPHY WHOSE

160
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
DISTRICT INCLUDES NEWTOWN.

161
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
LET ME START WITH THE PAST

162
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
COUPLE DAYS FOR YOU ALL.
I KNOW YOU HAVE TALKED TO SOME

163
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
OF THESE FAMILIES WHO

164
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
UNDERSTANDABLY DON'T WANT TO BE

165
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
OUT IN PUBLIC EXCEPT FOR WHEN

166
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
THEY CHOOSE TO.

167
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
WE DID SEE ONE FATHER GO OUT.

168
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
CAN YOU TELL US AS SILLY AS THIS

169
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
MAY SEEM HOW ARE THEY HOLDING

170
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
UP?
WHAT'S SUSTAINING THEM AT THIS

171
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
POINT?

172
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
>> I DON'T THINK THAT ONE WORD

173
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
OR ONE SENTENCE OR ONE

174
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
DESCRIPTION WILL FIT ALL OF

175
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
THEM.
THEY ARE AS DIVERSE PROBABLY AS

176
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS.

177
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I CAN TELL YOU THIS COMMUNITY

178
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS STRENGTH

179
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
AND RESILIENCE AND RESOLVE IN

180
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
COMING TOGETHER.

181
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
WE WERE AT CHURCH SERVICE THIS

182
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
MORNING, WHICH WAS SO MOVING IN

183
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
ITS STATEMENT OF GRIEF BUT ALSO

184
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
COMING TOGETHER AND BONDING AND

185
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
STAYING STRONG.

186
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER FORGET

187
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
THE CRIES OF GRIEF AND PAIN THAT

188
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I SAW AT THE FIREHOUSE ON THAT

189
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
DAY AND AS A PARENT, AS A PERSON

190
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
JUST THE UNSPEAKABLE SADNESS

191
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
THAT PREVADSS THIS TOWN STILL

192
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
AND WILL GO ON FOR QUITE SOME

193
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
TIME.
>> AND YOU SAID THAT YOU'RE SOON

194
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
TO BE SENATOR ELECT, THIS IS

195
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
PART OF YOUR DISTRICT AND PEOPLE

196
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
HAVE ASKED ME TO DESCRIBE IT.

197
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I SAID IF YOU EVER HAD A TRAIN

198
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
SET THAT RAN AROUND YOUR

199
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
CHRISTMAS TREE, THE VILLAGE

200
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
INSIDE IT WOULD BE NEWTOWN.

201
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
IT JUST IS THAT KIND OF A

202
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
VILLAGE.

203
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
YOU MUST KNOW PEOPLE HERE WHO

204
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
MUST BE DEEPLY AFFECTED, THE

205
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
MOST DIRECTLY AFFECTED AND WHAT

206
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
ARE YOU TAKING FROM THEM AND

207
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
WHAT DO THEY NEED?

208
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
>> YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE

209
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
QUINTESSENTIAL IDYLLIC NEW

210
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
ENGLAND COMMUNITY.

211
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
SMALL TOWN, PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS

212
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
CLOSENESS.

213
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
A LABOR DAY PARADE HERE THAT

214
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
HAPPENS THAT THE WHOLE STATE

215
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
COMES TO, THE BIGGEST IN THE

216
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
AREA, EVERY COMMUNITY GROUP AND

217
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
SCHOOL HAS A FLOAT, AND THE

218
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
CLOSENESS OF THE TOWN MAKES THE

219
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
GRIEVING EVEN WORSE.

220
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
EVERYONE KNOWS ONE OF THE YOUNG

221
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
LITTLE BOYS OR GIRLS THAT WAS

222
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
KILLED OR ONE OF THE ADULTS.

223
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I FRANKLY THINK IT WILL BE ONE

224
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
OF THE THINGS THAT LETS THIS

225
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
COMMUNITY HEAL.
BECAUSE THERE'S A CLOSENESS,

226
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
EVERYONE IS SO TIGHT KNIT YOU'RE

227
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
SEEING THESE ACTS OF HUMANITY

228
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
SPILLING OVER IN THE LAST FEW

229
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
DAYS.
THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE AFTER

230
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
THE LIGHTS LEAVE.

231
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
AND THE CLOSENESS OF THE

232
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
COMMUNITY HURTS BUT IT'S GOING

233
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
TO HELP US HEAL.
>> IT DOES.

234
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND

235
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH

236
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
BECAUSE THEY'RE KIND OF GOING

237
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
THROUGH THE SAME THING EVEN IF

238
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
THEY'RE NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED

239
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
THE PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN OR

240
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
RELATIVES OF THE ADULTS.

241
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
WE'RE LOOKING AT LIVE PICTURES

242
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
NOW OF WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND

243
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
NEWTOWN AND, OF COURSE, THERE

244
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
WILL BE THE VIGIL TONIGHT WITH

245
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
THE PRESIDENT.

246
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS FROM THE

247
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
POINT OF VIEW OF THE CONGRESSMAN

248
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
THAT REPRESENTS THE DISTRICT OR

249
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
THE SENATOR WHO REPRESENTS THE

250
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
STATE, DO YOU FEEL A SENSE OF

251
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
HELPLESSNESS LIKE WHAT CAN I DO?

252
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
BECAUSE IN EFFECT, THE ONE THING

253
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
THAT WOULD HELP, YOU CAN'T DO?

254
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
>> THE SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS IS

255
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
VERY REAL, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

256
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'M HEARING FROM PEOPLE HERE IN

257
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
NEWTOWN, PARTICULARLY PEOPLE IN

258
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT, YOU KNOW, I

259
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
COME TO THIS ISSUE AND THIS

260
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
PLACE WITH A CAREER IN LAW

261
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
ENFORCEMENT 30 YEARS AS A

262
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, UNITED

263
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
STATES ATTORNEY, AS WELL AS

264
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR 20

265
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
YEARS AND MY COLLEAGUES IN LAW

266
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
ENFORCEMENT SAY TO ME YOU HAVE

267
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT ASSAULT

268
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
WEAPONS, HIGH CAPACITY

269
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
MAGAZINES, BOTH VERY

270
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
INSTRUMENTAL IN THIS CRIME AND

271
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
SO THERE IS A SENSE OF

272
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
HELPLESSNESS BUT ALSO A SENSE OF

273
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
MISSION THAT CITIZENS ON THE

274
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
STREETS, IN THE CHURCHES, ARE

275
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
SAYING TO ME, WE NEED TO DO

276
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
SOMETHING.
IT IS A CALL TO ACTION.

277
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
>> AND DO YOU FEEL THAT SAME

278
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
CALL TO ACTION?

279
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

280
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
THESE.
I MEAN THERE WAS A YOUNG GIRL

281
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
THAT DIED IN TUCSON IN THE GABBY

282
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
GIFFORDS SHOOTING, A LOT OF

283
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
PEOPLE THAT DIED, BUT A

284
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
9-YEAR-OLD I THINK THAT DIED IN

285
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
THAT.

286
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
WE HAD A BABY KILLED IN THE

287
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
AURORA THEATER.

288
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
AND THIS IS SORT OF HORRIFIC

289
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
BEYOND IMAGINATION BECAUSE

290
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
THERE'S SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE.

291
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
WE'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE.

292
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
AND THERE IS -- YOU KNOW, THERE

293
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
ARE PEOPLE SAYING WAIT A MINUTE,

294
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
CAN WE NOT DO ANYTHING JUST AS A

295
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
KNEE-JERK REACTION, WE NEED TO

296
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
THINK THIS THROUGH.

297
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
>> THE TIPPING POINT ON THESE

298
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
ISSUES WHETHER IT'S TAKING ON

299
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS OR PROVIDING

300
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
MORE COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH

301
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
OR ADDRESSING THE SORT OF

302
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
CULTURE OF VIOLENCE THAT PROMPTS

303
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
SOMEBODY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE

304
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
THIS, THE TIPPING POINT SHOULD

305
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
HAVE HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO.

306
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
IF THIS IS THE TIPPING POINT,

307
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO DOWN TO

308
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
WASHINGTON AND PROMPT A

309
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
CONVERSATION THAT'S LONG

310
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
OVERDUE.
YOU KNOW, A YOUNG MAN GRABBED US

311
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
IN HIS CHURCH WE WERE IN SOBBING

312
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
SAYING, DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN

313
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
AGAIN.
I THINK OUR JOB HERE IS TO NOT

314
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
SET EXPECTATIONS TOO HIGH,

315
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
RIGHT.
THIS IS COMPLICATED.

316
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
AND SO WE CAN'T SOLVE IT WITH

317
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
LEGISLATION.

318
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
THERE ARE CERTAINLY GOING TO BE

319
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
LESSONS LEARNED.

320
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
>> ISN'T THAT IN THE END SORT OF

321
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
BALANCE YOU HAVE TO TAKE, IN

322
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
THAT A PERSON WITHOUT A HISTORY,

323
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
A CRIMINAL RECORD OR MENTAL

324
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
HEALTH RECORD OF ANY SORT, THAT

325
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
WOULD SUGGEST SOME KIND OF

326
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
VIOLENT TENDENCIES, CAN GET

327
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
GUNS.
SOME OF THE STRICTEST GUN LAWS

328
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
IN THE COUNTRY ARE HERE IN

329
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
CONNECTICUT AND THESE GUNS SO

330
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
FAR WE KNOW WERE PURCHASED

331
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
LEGALLY.
THERE IS A LIMIT TO WHAT ANYBODY

332
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
CAN DO TO STOP THIS SORT OF

333
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
THING?

334
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
>> WE ARE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE

335
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
TO TAKE GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF

336
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
EVERY DERANGED PERSON, BUT WE

337
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
CAN DO SOMETHING.

338
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
AND I THINK THERE IS RENEWED

339
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE.

340
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I THINK THAT THIS INCIDENT,

341
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
HORRIFIC AND HORRIBLE AS IT IS,

342
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
ALMOST UNSPEAKABLE IN ITS

343
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
INHUMANITY AND CRUELTY, WILL

344
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
SPUR AND TRANSFORM THE NATIONAL

345
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
DISCUSSION ABOUT IT AND PERHAPS

346
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
LEAD TO MORE ACTION AND AT THE

347
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
VERY LEAST, PERHAPS DOING

348
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
SOMETHING ABOUT HIGH-CAPACITY

349
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
MAGAZINES.
>> AND FOR OUR VIEWERS THOSE ARE

350
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
THE THINGS YOU CAN ATTACH TO AN

351
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
ADULT WEAPON AND THEY FIRE OFF

352
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
100 ROUNDS IN JUST MINUSCULE

353
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
AMOUNT OF TIME.
A LOT OF THEM JAM AS WE SAW IN

354
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
AURORA, DID NOT HAPPEN THIS

355
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
TIME, THAT'S WHAT HE USED

356
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
APPARENTLY WAS THE HIGH-CAPACITY

357
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
MAGAZINE.

358
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU THINK

359
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
COULD BE DONE IS A BAN OR

360
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
LIMITATION OF SOME SORT ON THESE

361
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES.

362
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
WHAT ABOUT AN ASSAULT WEAPONS

363
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
BAN?
>> LISTEN, I THINK IT'S CLEAR

364
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
THAT NOBODY NEEDS TO HAVE

365
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
AMMUNITION THAT DISPENSES 30

366
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
ROUNDS IN A NUMBER OF SECONDS.

367
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT NOBODY THAT

368
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
HAS DEEP SEATED MENTAL HEALTH

369
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
ISSUES SHOULD BE IN A WAITING

370
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
LINE TO GET SERVICES.

371
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
AND SO I THINK FOR US, YOU KNOW,

372
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
RIGHT NOW OUR FOCUS IS ON THE

373
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
VICTIMS AND HELPING PEOPLE

374
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
GRIEVE HERE.

375
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE FULL

376
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
POLICE REPORTS TO UNDERSTAND

377
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE BUT ONCE WE

378
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
DO, I THINK THERE ARE GOING TO

379
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
BE -- I HOPE SOME PRETTY EASY

380
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
POLICY LESSONS THAT CAN FINALLY

381
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
START TO BRING US TOGETHER.

382
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
>> AND WHAT ABOUT JUST BRIEFLY

383
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
IN THE MINUTE OR SO WE HAVE

384
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
LEFT, WHAT ABOUT SCHOOL

385
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
SECURITY?

386
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
IN CONNECTICUT, IS A RELOOK

387
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
UNDER WAY?
BECAUSE IN THE END, A DOORBELL

388
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
OR A PASS WILL -- SOMEBODY -- I

389
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
MEAN THAT'S JUST NOT GOING TO

390
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
WORK CLEARLY.

391
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
SO WHAT IS THE ANSWER?

392
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
IS THE ANSWER TO HAVE POLICEMEN

393
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
AT THE DOORS OF ELEMENTARY

394
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
SCHOOLS?
IS THAT GOING TOO FAR.

395
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
WOULD ANYTHING GO TOO FAR IF IT

396
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
WOULD HAVE STOPPED THIS?
>> I THINK THERE WILL BE A TIME

397
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
FOR US, SITTING IN NEWTOWN IN

398
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
THE MIDST OF THIS GRIEF AND

399
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
SADNESS, TO BE MORE SPECIFIC

400
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO, WHAT WE

401
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
SHOULD DO AS A NATION.

402
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
MY COLLEAGUES ARE CALLING FROM

403
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY LITERALLY

404
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
TO NOT ONLY WISH US WELL, BUT

405
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
SAY, WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING AND

406
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I THINK ALL OF THOSE SPECIFICS

407
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
WILL AWAIT A TIME WHEN MAYBE WE

408
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
CAN GIVE IT THE SENSIBLE,

409
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
THOUGHTFULLY, HOPEFULLY

410
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
EFFECTIVE ATTENTION IT DESERVES.

411
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
>> JUST AS A FINAL QUESTION, DO

412
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
YOU HEAR THAT FROM PEOPLE WHO

413
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
FORMALLY THOUGHT -- FORMERLY

414
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
THOUGHT WE DON'T NEED MORE LAWS,

415
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
WE NEED TO ENFORCE THE ONES WE

416
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
HAVE?

417
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
HAS THERE BEEN A CHANGE OF

418
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
THOUGHT?
>> I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY.

419
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
RIGHT HERE TO BE HONEST THERE

420
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
ARE PEOPLE COMING UP AND SAYING

421
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN

422
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
AGAIN, BUT THAT'S RARE.

423
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
MOST PEOPLE RIGHT NOW ARE JUST

424
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
SIMPLY TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE

425
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
TRAGEDY AND SO, YOU KNOW, THE

426
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
FAMILIES HERE I THINK WANT US TO

427
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
MAKE SURE THEY HAVE EVERYTHING

428
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
THEY NEED.
THE COMMUNITY HAS EVERYTHING WE

429
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
NEED.
AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT WHERE THIS

430
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
COMMUNITY WANTS US TO GO FROM A

431
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
POLICY STAND-POINT IN THE COMING

432
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
DAYS.

433
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
>> SENATOR-ELECT CHRIS MURPHY,

434
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000

NOT A PART OF PUBLIC SERVICE YOU

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
LOOK FORWARD TO.

438
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
>>> WHEN WE RETURN, A SURVIVOR

439

THE BEACHES AND WATERS
COULDN'T BE MORE BEAUTIFUL.

457
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
TAKE A BOAT RIDE, GO FISHING
OR JUST LAY IN THE SUN.

NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, IN FACT,

478
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
THIS SCENE, THE PEOPLE HAVE

479
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
CHANGED, BUT THE SCENE HAS NOT.

480
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
GETTING INTO THIS TOWN, GETTING

481
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
TO THE SITE OF WHERE SO MANY

482
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
VIGILS HAVE BEEN HELD, AND IT'S

483
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
A SMALL TOWN, THE TRAFFIC INTO

484
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
NEWTOWN HAS BEEN AMAZING.

485
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE HERE THAN

486
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
ARE IN THE TOWN, CLEARLY THEY

487
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
ARE COMING FROM SO MANY PLACES

488
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
TO TRY TO KIND OF FIND A CENTRAL

489
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
POINT WHERE THEY LITERALLY CAN

490
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
COME TO SAY I'M SORRY, COME TO

491
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
SAY I FEEL THIS DISASTER THAT IT

492
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
WAS TO THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN.

493
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
SO IT'S A KIND OF SCENE YOU SEE

494
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
EVERYWHERE AND HAVE SEEN

495
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
CONTINUALLY, MORNING AND EARLY

496
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
THIS MORNING WHEN WE DROVE IN

497
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
LATE LAST NIGHT AND EARLY THIS

498
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
MORNING, CARS BACKED UP JUST

499
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
TRYING TO GET INTO THIS TOWN.

500
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
SO THAT IS THE SCENE NOW AS WE

501
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
AWAIT, OF COURSE, THIS EVENING,
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE HERE AND

502
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
YOU WILL SEE EVEN LARGER CROWDS.

503
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
RIGHT NOW, I WANT TO INTRODUCE

504
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
YOU TO SOMEONE, STEVEN BARTON.

505
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000

MIDNIGHT PREMIER OF THE NEW

507
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
"BATMAN" MOVIE.

508
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT WAS

509
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
WORSE THAN ANY HORROR ON THE

510
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
SCREEN.

511
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
>> THIS PAST SUMMER IN A MOVIE

512
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
THEATER IN COLORADO, I WAS SHOT.

513
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
SHOT IN THE FACE AND NECK.

514
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
BUT I WAS LUCKY.

515
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, 48,000

516
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
AMERICANS WON'T BE SO LUCKY.

517
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
BECAUSE THEY'LL BE MURDERED WITH

518
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
GUNS IN THE NEXT PRESIDENT'S

519
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
TERM.
ENOUGH TO FILL OVER 200

520
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
THEATERS.

521
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000

WASHINGTON.

531
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT GUN

532
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
CONTROL, BUT I WANT TO TALK TO

533
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
YOU AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN

534

THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE AND WE

535
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
SHOULD TELL OUR VIEWERS YOU LIVE

536
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
TEN MINUTES FROM HERE.

537
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000

>> BICYCLING.

542
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
>> BUT YOU LIVE TEN MINUTES FROM

543
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
HERE.
>> YES.

544
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
>> SO YOU MUST HAVE HAD SOME

545
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
REAL FLASHBACKS.

546
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
>> OH ABSOLUTELY.

547
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
AND BE EVEN NOW I'M DISCOVERING

548
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
PERSONAL CONNECTIONS TO THE

728
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
YET, ALTHOUGH THE STATE POLICE

729
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
OFFICIAL SAID THAT SOMEBODY --

730
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
THAT PEOPLE MAY BE PROSECUTED

731
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000

732

733
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000

WOULD BE OR HOW YOU COULD FRAME

739

740

KNOW, ALL KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES

746
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
THAT WOULD REQUIRE I THINK A

MORE HUMANE APPROACH TO IT.

748
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000

757

TALKING ABOUT A BILL THAT WAS

910
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
PASSED IN 2008, RIGHT AFTER

911
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
VIRGINIA TECH, THAT WAS A BILL

912
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
THAT I GOT PASSED THROUGH THE

913
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
HOUSE, THROUGH THE SENATE, AND

914
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED THAT, BUT

915
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT

916
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ENOUGH

917
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
MONEY THERE TO HAVE ALL THE

918
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
COURTS -- ANYBODY THAT'S BEEN

919
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
ADJUDICATED THROUGH THE COURTS

920
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
WHETHER FOR ANY CRIME THAT WOULD

921
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
ALREADY BASICALLY NOT ALLOW

922
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
SOMEONE TO OWN A GUN, TO BE PUT

923
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
INTO THE INSTANT BACKGROUND

924
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
SYSTEM.

925
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
THAT'S SOMETHING HE CAN DO.

926
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
THE HEAVY LIFTING IS GOING TO

927
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
HAVE TO COME FROM CONGRESS AND

928
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
IT WILL, BUT IF HE IS WILLING TO

929
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
USE THE BULLY PULPIT, HE CAN

930
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
ACTUALLY HELP US.

931
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
PRESIDENT CLINTON DID THAT.

932
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
IT WAS A TOUGH STRUGGLE BUT HE

933
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
GOT IT THROUGH.

934
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
FOR SOME REASON, AND I

935
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
PERSONALLY FEEL BECAUSE IT WAS

936
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
SO MANY CHILDREN INVOLVED, THE

937
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
ATTITUDES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

938
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
ARE LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN

939
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
THEY WERE BEFORE FRIDAY.

940
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
>> SO, BY IT, I BELIEVE YOU MEAN

941
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN, IS THAT

942
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, THE

943
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
PRESIDENT WOULD GET BEHIND THAT,

944
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
WHICH EXPIRED PROBABLY MORE THAN

945
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
TEN YEARS AGO?

946
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
>> YEAH.

947
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
THAT EXPIRED IN THE YEAR 2004.

948
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I KNOW SENATOR FEINSTEIN HAS

949
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
BEEN WORKING ON A NEW ASSAULT

950
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
WEAPONS BILL.

951
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
SHE'S BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR A

952
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
WHILE.

953
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
>> RIGHT.
>> WITH THE INTENTION OF MOST

954
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
LIKELY INTRODUCING IT OVER THE

955
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
FIRST OF THE YEAR WHEN WE GO

956
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
INTO A NEW SESSION.

957
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING

958
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
WITH HER ON THAT.

959
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
BUT THE 208 BILL THAT WAS

960
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
PASSED, IS THE NIC IMPROVEMENT

961
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
ACT.

962
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
THAT GOES TO THE COURTS BECAUSE

963
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
WE FOUND WHEN PEOPLE WERE

964
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
ADJUDICATED TO BE MENTALLY ILL,

965
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
AND THAT HAPPENED WITH THE

966
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
VIRGINIA TECH SHOOTING, THAT THE

967
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
RECORDS NEVER WENT INTO THE

968
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
INSTANT BACKGROUND CHECK.

969
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
IT WOULD COVER ANYONE DOMESTIC

970
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
VIOLENCE, FELONIES, HE COULD DO

971
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
SOMETHING BIG ON THAT RIGHT
AWAY.

972
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
AND THEN LIKE I SAID, WE WOULD

973
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER.

974
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
>> RIGHT.

975
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
AND AS -- IN FACT, SENATOR

976
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
FEINSTEIN SAID THIS MORNING SHE

977
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
WOULD INTRODUCE AN ASSAULT

978
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
WEAPONS BAN BILL AND TRY TO CUT

979
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
DOWN ON SOME OF THE LARGE

980
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
CAPACITY MAGAZINES THAT CAN

981
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
SHOOT 30, 40, 100 ROUNDS OF

982
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
AMMUNITION IN 30 SECONDS OR

983
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
SOMETHING, BUT LET ME GO BACK,

984
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT, THE

985
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
VIRGINIA TECH SHOOTER DID, IN

986
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
FACT, HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH

987
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
HISTORY THAT HAD HE BEEN BE IN

988
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
THE RECORDS, IT MIGHT HAVE

989
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
HALTED HIM FROM GETTING THE

990
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
GUNS, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER

991
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
CASES -- IN TUCSON, FOR

992
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
INSTANCE, AND SO FAR AS WE KNOW

993
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
AT LEAST IN THIS CASE, THERE'S

994
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
NO MENTAL HEALTH BACKGROUND.

995
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
IN THE END, THAT MIGHT HELP, BUT

996
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
IT MIGHT NOT HAVE PREVENTED

997
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
THIS.
AND IT MIGHT NOT HAVE PREVENTED

998
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
WHAT WENT ON IN TUCSON.

999
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
WITH THAT IN MIND, I WANTED TO

1000
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
PLAY YOU SOMETHING THAT THE

1001
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY BILL

1002
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
BENNETT SAID THIS MORNING

1003
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
TALKING ABOUT SECURITY AROUND

1004
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
SCHOOLS.

1005
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
>> I'M NOT SO SURE I WOULDN'T

1006
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
WANT ONE PERSON IN A SCHOOL

1007
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
ARMED, READY FOR THIS KIND OF

1008
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
THING.
THE PRINCIPAL LUNGED AT THIS

1009
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
GUY.
THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST LUNGED

1010
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
AT THE GUY.

1011
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
HAS TO BE SOMEONE WHO'S TRAINED,

1012
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE, BUT MY GOD,

1013
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
IF YOU CAN PREVENT THIS KIND OF

1014
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
THING.

1015
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
>> SO, CONGRESSWOMAN, WHAT ABOUT

1016
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE PUSH

1017
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
FROM THE OTHER SIDE, THAT THEY

1018
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
WERE JUST COMPLETELY DEFENSELESS

1019
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
INSIDE THIS SCHOOL.

1020
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT

1021
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT BILL BENNETT

1022
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
IS TALKING ABOUT?

1023
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
>> WELL, TO BE VERY HONEST WITH

1024
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
YOU, GOING BACK AGAIN AFTER THE

1025
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
VIRGINIA TECH LEGISLATION WAS

1026
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
PUT INTO LEAVE NO CHILD BEHIND

1027
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
WHICH BASICALLY I AUTHORED AND

1028
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
THAT WAS TO PREPARE THE

1029
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
SCHOOLS -- AND BY THE WAY THE

1030
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
SCHOOL OF CONNECTICUT DID

1031
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
EVERYTHING RIGHT AND THEY DID.

1032
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
THEY HAD THE LOCKDOWN.

1033
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE

1034
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
CANNOT SAVE EVERY LIFE.

1035
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
THERE'S NO LAW THAT COULD DO

1036
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
THAT.
AND AS FAR AS HAVING MORE GUNS,

1037
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
WE HAVE MORE GUNS IN THIS

1038
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
COUNTRY THAN ANY OTHER CIVILIZED

1039
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
NATION.

1040
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
IT HAS TO BE LOOKED AT

1041
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
WHOLISTICALLY.
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT MENTAL

1042
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
HEALTH, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THOSE

1043
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
SIGNS THAT LED UP TO THE OTHER

1044
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
SHOOTINGS AND NOW WE'RE SEEING

1045
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
THAT PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THIS

1046
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
PARTICULAR SHOOTER ALSO HAD

1047
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
SIGNS.

1048
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
SO I MEAN IT'S A COMBINATION OF

1049
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO ON THE

1050
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
SOCIAL LEVEL, WE CAN ASK PEOPLE,

1051
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
CERTAINLY CHILDREN HAVE BEEN

1052
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
TRAINED, ESPECIALLY GH SCHOOL

1053
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
KIDS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU SEE A

1054
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
CLASSMATE THAT IS ACTING STRANGE

1055
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
OR TEACHERS SEEING SOMEONE THAT

1056
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
MIGHT BE ANTI-SOCIAL, TO MAKE

1057
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
SURE THAT YOUNG PERSON GETS SOME

1058
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
HELP.

1059
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER FOR

1060
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
EVERY SINGLE SITUATION.

1061
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
THAT SHOULD NOT PREVENT US FOR

1062
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
THE BIGGER PICTURE WHEN YOU LOOK

1063
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
AT AN AWFUL LOT OF THESE KILLERS

1064
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
THAT WERE MENTALLY ILL, THE

1065
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
SIGNS WERE THERE, BUT

1066
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
UNFORTUNATELY NOBODY PICKED UP

1067
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
FOR THEM.

1068
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
SantHo, Ho, Ho!anta!

1069
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Santa!

1070
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000

I landed on my keys.

1074
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Did you get that?

1075
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Oh yeah.

1076
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
That was amazing.

1077
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Here you go.

1078
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That was a fun trick!

1079
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
See? Santa's okay.

1080
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Walk it off Santa.

SO IF YOU'RE ONE OF THEM PEOPLE

AND THE INVESTIGATION, IT GOES

1143
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
ON AS FAR AS WE KNOW AND AS FAR

1144
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
AS WE WERE TOLD JUST AN HOUR

1145
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
AGO, IN FACT, THEY ARE STILL IN

1146
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
THE SCHOOL, THEY ARE STILL AT

1147
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
VARIOUS SITES IN THIS

1148
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
INVESTIGATION.
I SPOKE WITH CONNECTICUT'S

1149
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
GOVERNOR EARLIER THIS MORNING.

1150
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
>> GOVERNOR, THANK YOU FOR

1151
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
JOINING US HERE.

1152
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
LET ME JUST FIRST ASK YOU ABOUT

1153
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
THE STATE OF THE INVESTIGATION.

1154
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
WHAT DO WE NOW KNOW AND WHERE

1155
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
ARE WE IN THE INVESTIGATION?

1156
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
>> YOU KNOW, FIRST AND FOREMOST,

1157
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
THAT'S A STATE POLICE IS
HANDLING THAT INVESTIGATION.

1158
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I THINK WE KNOW EVERYTHING THAT

1159
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
IS MOST IMPORTANT.

1160
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
THERE WAS A SINGLE SHOOTER AND

1161
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
THAT SHOOTER IS DEAD.

1162
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
HE WAS TROUBLED INDIVIDUAL AND

1163
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
HE WENT TO THE SCHOOL WITH A

1164
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
NUMBER OF WEAPONS, WHICH HE USED

1165
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
ON HIS VICTIMS AND ULTIMATELY

1166
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
USED ON HIMSELF.

1167
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
YOU KNOW, SOME OF THIS OTHER
STUFF WILL PLAY OUT OVER A

1168
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
PERIOD OF TIME.

1169
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I'M SURE WE'LL COME TO KNOW MORE

1170
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
ABOUT HIM, HIS PROBLEMS, AND HIS

1171
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
FAMILY.

1172
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
YOU KNOW, THESE THINGS MOVE ON.

1173
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
THIS INVESTIGATION WILL TELL US

1174
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
THOSE THINGS, BUT, YOU KNOW, I

1175
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN

1176
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
THAT.

1177
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
>> SO TELL ME, LET ME GO BACK TO

1178
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
A COUPLE THINGS YOU JUST SAID.

1179
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
THE FIRST IS THE WEAPONRY.

1180
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
SO FAR AS YOU KNOW, WERE THESE

1181
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
WEAPONS LEGALLY OBTAINED BY THE

1182
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
MOTHER, WHICH WE'RE LED TO

1183
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
BELIEVE THEY WERE HER WEAPONS?
>> THE MOTHER PURCHASED THEM.

1184
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
THEY HAVE THE PATINA OF LEGAL

1185
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
PURCHASES.

1186
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
THERE'S ALWAYS A QUESTION WAS

1187
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
SHE PURCHASING THEM FOR HERSELF,

1188
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
WHICH IN THAT CASE IT WAS LEGAL.

1189
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
IF SHE WAS PURCHASING THEM FOR

1190
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL, HER SON,
THEN THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT

1191
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
THAT PURCHASE.

1192
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
>> DO WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT
INDICATES THAT?

1193
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
>> THE OTHER THING IS THIS

1194
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
ASSAULT WEAPON.
CONNECTICUT HAS A PRETTY

1195
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
AGGRESSIVE LAW PROBABLY OF THE

1196
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
50 STATES, WE'RE RANKED FOURTH

1197
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
MOST AGGRESSIVE IN TRYING TO

1198
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
LIMIT ACCESS TO THESE KINDS OF

1199
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
WEAPONS.

1200
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE ABSENCE OF A

1201
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
BRADY BILL, IN THE ABSENCE OF

1202
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
FEDERAL LEGISLATION, PEOPLE USE

1203
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
DESCRIPTIVE TERMS TO TRY TO GET

1204
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
AROUND THE LIMITATIONS THAT ARE

1205
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
BUILT INTO OUR STATUTES HERE IN

1206
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
CONNECTICUT OR MIGHT OTHERWISE

1207
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
NOT HAPPEN IF WE HAD FEDERAL

1208
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
LEGISLATION ON THIS ISSUE.

1209
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
THESE ARE ASSAULT WEAPONS.

1210
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
YOU DON'T HUNT DEER WITH THESE
THINGS.

1211
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT

1212
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

1213
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
HAVE TO RESOLVE THEIR OWN MINDS.

1214
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
WHERE SHOULD THIS LINE GET

1215
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
DRAWN?

1216
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
>> SO AS I UNDERSTAND WHAT

1217
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
YOU'RE SAYING, THERE WAS A SEMI

1218
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
ASSAULT WEAPON BUT NOT

1219
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
NECESSARILY ONE BANNED BY

1220
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
CONNECTICUT, WHICH HAS A STATE

1221
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
LAW BANNING CERTAIN KINDS OF
ASSAULT WEAPONS?

1222
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
>> WELL, BUT THAT THEN BEGS THE

1223
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
QUESTION, WAS THIS A WEAPON THAT

1224
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
SHOULD HAVE BEEN BANNED AND

1225
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
BECAUSE OF HOW

1226
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
THE MANUFACTURER DECIDED TO

1227
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
DESCRIBE IT GOT AROUND THAT LAW?

1228
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
>> SO LET ME GO BACK TO A COUPLE

1229
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
THINGS THAT YOU SAID.

1230
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
THE FIRST IS, IS THERE ANYTHING

1231
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
THAT LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE SHE
MIGHT HAVE PURCHASED THEM FOR

1232
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
HER SON, OR IS THAT JUST HERE

1233
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
ARE THE POSSIBILITIES?
>> HERE ARE THE POSSIBILITIES.

1234
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
THEY'RE LIVING TOGETHER.

1235
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
THEY'RE IN THE HOME.

1236
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
HE ENDS UP WITH THE GUNS, SO

1237
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
THERE MAY BE AN EXPLANATION.

1238
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
>> THEY'RE LOOKING INTO THAT.

1239
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
THE OTHER ISSUE DESCRIBED HIS AS

1240
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
TROUBLED, WHICH WE KNOW FROM

1241
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
WHAT HE DID.

1242
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
IS THERE OTHER EVIDENCE AS

1243
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
THEY'VE GONE IN ABOUT TROUBLED

1244
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
HOW?

1245
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
>> YOU KNOW, CLEARLY, HE WAS

1246
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
TROUBLED.

1247
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
YOU HAVE TO BE DERANGED TO CARRY

1248
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
OUT THIS KIND OF CRIME.

1249
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT IN A POSITION

1250
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
THAT I SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT

1251
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE'S FAMILY.

1252
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
THAT INFORMATION WILL COME OUT

1253
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
IN DUE COURSE, BUT THIS WAS

1254
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
CLEARLY A TROUBLED PERSON.

1255
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
>> IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS

1256
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
MENTALLY DISABLED IN SOME WAY?

1257
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
>> THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS

1258
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
MENTALLY DISABLED BY THE ACTS

1259
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
THAT HE COMMITTED.

1260
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
ONE DOESN'T SHOOT THEIR
MOTHER --

1261
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
>> SURE.

1262
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
BUT NOTHING BEHIND THAT YOU'RE

1263
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
FINDING IN THE INVESTIGATION

1264
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
THUS FAR?

1265
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
>> THERE ARE -- AS HAS BEEN

1266
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
ATTESTED TO ALREADY BY FAMILY

1267
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
MEMBERS AND OTHERS IN THE

1268
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
NEWSPAPERS, THIS WAS A TROUBLED
INDIVIDUAL.

1269
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
>> OKAY.

1270
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
AS FAR AS THE GUNS ARE

1271
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
CONCERNED, DO THEY COME OUT OF

1272
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
THE HOME?

1273
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
IS THAT WHERE THEY -- WERE THEY
SECURED IN THE HOME?

1274
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
>> YES, THAT'S OUR BELIEF.

1275
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
>> LET ME MOVE YOU ON TO YOUR

1276
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
ROLE NOW.

1277
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
THERE ALWAYS COMES THIS POINT

1278
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
WHERE THE INVESTIGATION IS
ONGOING.

1279
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
THIS INCREDIBLE GRIEF THESE

1280
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
FAMILIES MUST BE AND ARE

1281
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
SUFFERING IS GOING ON.

1282
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
WHAT DO YOU DO NOW?

1283
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
>> YOU KNOW, CANDY, I WAS WITH

1284
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

1285
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
FAMILIES FRIDAY MORNING, AND

1286
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
ULTIMATELY I HAD TO BREAK IT TO

1287
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
ALL OF THE FOLKS WHO WERE

1288
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
ASSEMBLED AT THE FIREHOUSE THAT

1289
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
THEIR CHILDREN OR LOVED ONE IN
THE CASE OF THE ADULTS WERE NOT

1290
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
COMING HOME.

1291
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
AND THAT'S AN EXERCISE THAT I

1292
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
WILL LIVE WITH FOR THE REST OF

1293
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
MY LIFE.

1294
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU'RE

1295
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000

1296
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000

1298
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
WE HAVE A JOB TO DO.

1299
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
WE HAVE TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND

1300
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
HELP PEOPLE RECOVER AND MOVE ON

1301
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
AND GET CHILDREN BACK TO SCHOOL

1302
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE
BROADER SYSTEM AND HOPEFULLY

1303

THESE CHILDREN AT THIS SCHOOL

1304
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000

>> TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD YOU
CORRECTLY.

1307

YOU'RE THE ONE THAT INITIALLY

1308
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
HAD TO TELL THE FAMILIES

1309
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
GATHERED IN THAT ROOM WHAT MANY

1310
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
FEARED OR SINCE SOME OF THEM

1311
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
MIGHT HAVE ALREADY KNOWN AT A

1312
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
GUT LEVEL, YOU WERE THE ONE THAT

1313
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
FINALIZED IT FOR THEM?

1314
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
>> YES.

1315
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
>> TELL ME ABOUT THAT MOMENT.

1316
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
>> IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING
TO DO.

1317
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
THESE PARENTS HAD BEEN GATHERED

1318
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
FOR A NUMBER OF HOURS CLINGING

1319
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000

SOMEONE HAD TO DECIDE HOW TO

1324
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
HANDLE THAT SITUATION.

1325
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
ULTIMATELY IT FELL UPON ME TO DO

1326
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
THAT.

BE RETURNING TO THEM THAT DAY OR

1332

IN THE FUTURE IT IS A TOUGH
