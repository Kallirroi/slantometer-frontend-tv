THAT ARE GOING ON AT HOME WITH

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
DOMESTIC SITUATIONS THAT COULD

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
SPILL OVER INTO OUR SCHOOLS.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE DOING

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000

OUTSIDE OF SCHOOLS.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
WE HAVE MANY CRISIS PLANS IN

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
MOST SCHOOLS.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
THE PROBLEM IS THEY'RE OFTEN

SITTING 0EN A SHELF COLLECTING

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
DUST.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
THE STAFF HAVEN'T BEEN TRAINED

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
DO AND LITERALLY TEACHERS,

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
WHICH ONE HE USED TO KILL

188
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
HIMSELF BUT THEY WON'T REVEAL

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
THAT INFORMATION.
ALL OF THIS HAS LEFT US WITH

190
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
MORE QUESTIONS REALLY THAN

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
ANSWERS AND SOME QUESTIONS WE

192
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
MAY NEVER GET ANSWERS TO ABOUT

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
THE POSSIBLE MOTIVE OF THIS

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
SHOOTER.

195
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
CNN'S MARY SNOW HAS A CLOSER

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
LOOK AT THE SUSPECT FOR US NOW.

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
>> SHORTLY AFTER THE HORRIFIC

198
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
SHOOTINGS, POLICE AND S.W.A.T.

199
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
HOME BEHIND ME AND IT'S CLOSED

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
OFF BY POLICE.

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE NOW SUGGESTING

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
THAT THEY ARE PIECING TOGETHER

204
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
INFORMATION LEADING TO POSSIBLE

205
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
ANSWERS ABOUT HOW AND DWLP

206
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
HAPPENED.
LIEUTENANT PAUL VANCE OF THE

CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE SAYING

208
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
THAT IN HIS WORDS, GOOD EVIDENCE

209
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
IS BEING RECOVERED BUT HE DID

210
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
NOT GO INTO DETAIL.

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
IN TERMS OF THE WEAPONS USED, WE

212
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
DO KNOW THAT THREE WEAPONS WERE

213
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
RECOVERED AT THE SCENE OF THE

214
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
SHOOTING NEAR THE SUSPECT'S

215
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
BODY.
THERE WERE TWO HANDGUNS AND A

216
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE.

217
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
CNN HAS BEEN REPORTING THAT

218
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
THOSE GUNSES WERE PURCHASED BY

219
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
HIS MOTHER, NANCY LANZA.

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
THERE'S NOT MUCH WE DO KNOW

221
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
ABOUT NANCY LANZA.

222
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
WE SPOKE TO A NEIGHBOR EARLIER

223
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
IN THE DAY, AND SHE SAID THAT

224
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
SHE KNEW HER.

225
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING OUT OF THE

226
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
ORDINARY THAT SHE COULD SEE.

227
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
>> SHE WAS LIKE A NORMAL ANYBODY

228
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
ELSE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

229
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
YOU KNOW, DECORATE THE HOUSE AND

230
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
THE HOUSE WAS ALWAYS, YOU KNOW,

231
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
PRISTINE AND I MEAN, SHE WAS

232
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER HOUSEWIFE.

233
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
>> AS FOR ADAM LANZA, FORMER

234
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
CLASSMATES DESCRIBE HIM AS BEING

235
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
A SMART STUDENT, SOMEONE WHO WAS

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
QUIET.
KEPT TO HIMSELF.

237
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
A NEIGHBOR WHO KNEW HIM IN

238
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
RECENT YEARS DESCRIBED HIM AS

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
SLOWLY LEARNING SOME OF THE

252
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
ADULTS OF THIS ATTACK.

253
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
THERE WERE 208 CHILDREN BETWEEN

254
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10.

255
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
SO YOUNG.
THEY DIED IN THE SHOOTING SPREE

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
ALONG WITH THOSE SIX ADULTS,

257
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
MANY OF THEM EDUCATORS IN THE

258

SCHOOL.

259
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
THE SCHOOL'S PRINCIPAL WAS ONE

260
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
OF THOSE.
ALSO THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST.

261
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
THOSE TWOS WOMEN RAN TOWARDS THE

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON TO SEE

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
WHETHER THEY COULD HAVE

265
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
PREVENTED THIS TRAGEDY THAT

266
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
UNFOLDED.
NICK VALENCIA HERE IN ATLANTA,

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
YOU'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT WHO

268
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000

WHAT WE DO KNOW IS 26 PEOPLE ARE

278
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
DEAD.
TWO NAMES CNN HAS BEEN ABLE TO

HOCHSPRUNG.
SHE BEGAN AS THE PRINCIPAL

AROUND TWO YEARS AGO BEING

283
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
DESCRIBED AS A SERIOUS BUT

284
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
AFFABLE LEADER, A TOUGH LEADER

285
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
IN THE RIGHT SORT OF SENSE,

286
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
SOMEBODY THAT YOU WOULD WANT

287
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000

288
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
SHE RECENTLY OVERSAW IS THE

289
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
SCHOOL SECURITY SYSTEM PROJECT.

290
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
EVERY VISITOR WAS REQUIRED TO

291
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
BUZZ IN THAT FRONT ENTRANCE

292
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
BEFORE ENTERING.

293
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
WE DO KNOW NOW AS DETAILS

294
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
UNFOLDED ABOUT THE SUSPECTED

295
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
SHOOTER THAT HE FORCED HIS WAY

DON LEMON WAS REPORTING.

298
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
GETTING BACK TO THE PRINCIPAL

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
HOCHSPRUNG, SHE WAS AN EXTREMELY

300
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000

302
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
SHE HAD ABOUT 1 YEARS OF

303
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000

DAUGHTERS.
ALSO AMONG THE VICTIMS IS MARY

AS YOU MENTIONED, DEB, AND DEB,

310
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000

SBRUNG BOTH IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE

312
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
TOLD CNN THEY WERE THERE WITH

314
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000

THE PRINCIPAL AND THE

321
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
AND CHECK OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING

322
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
IN THEIR SCHOOL.

323
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
WE KNOW NOW THAT THE SUSPECTER

324
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
HAD BURST INTO THE ELEMENTARY

325
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
THAT WAS THE SITE OF THE

333
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
SHOOTING.

334
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000

TEACHING EXPERIENCE.

347
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000

THE GUNMAN WHILE HER SCHOOL

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
CHILDREN, WHILE HER STUDENTS
WERE ABLE TO RUN PAST THAT

350
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
GUNMAN.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CALLING HER

GOD, WHY DID YOU TAKE HER?

363
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
ANOTHER PERSON WHO WE BELIEVE IS

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
LIFE JUST TRAGICALLY INTERRUPTED

370
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
AND CUT SHORT.

371
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000

DON?
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU GUYS

376
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
VERY MUCH.

377
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I TOLD YOU THAT WE WERE HERE AT

378
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
THE NEWTOWN METHODIST CHURCH.

379
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
THIS IS BETH SQUARE.
WE'VE BEEN SEEING PEOPLE COMING

380
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
IN HERE AND WANTING TO PAY

381
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
RESPECTS AND JUST TO SORT OF

382
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
PROP UP THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE

383
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
AND SHOW SUPPORT.

384
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
KRISTIN AND MATT PANICHELLA FROM

385
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
THE WESTON CONNECTICUT.

386
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
>> IT'S ABOUT 20 MILES AWAY.

387
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
>> YOU'VE GOT FLOWERS IN YOUR

388
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
HAND.

389
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
WHY?
>> I THINK THE LEAST WE COULD DO

390
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
IS COME PAY RESPECT TO THE

391
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
FAMILIES AND TO THE LIVES THAT

392
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
WERE LOST HERE.

393
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
>> AS YOU THINK ABOUT IT, YOU'VE

394
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
GOT OLIVIA IS 1-YEAR-OLD.

395
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THESE

396
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
FAMILIES ARE DEALING WITH?

397
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
>> NO, I THINK THAT'S BEEN THE

398
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
MOST HEARTBREAKING PART OF THIS

399
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
WHOLE THING IS WANTING TO BE

400
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
THERE FOR THEM AND TRYING TO

401
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
UNDER THE PAIN THEY MUST BE

402
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
GOING THROUGH.

403
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
>> YEAH.
AND THAT'S WITH A CHILD.

404
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I DON'T HAVE A CHILD.

405
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE SENDING MY

406
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
CHILD OFF TO SCHOOL.

407
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
>> THAT'S THE WORST PART.

408
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
THAT'S THE WORST PART IS JUST

409
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
PUTTING THAT BACKPACK ON YOUR

410
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
KID AND PUTTING THEM ON THE BUS

411
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
AND THEM NOT COMING HOME.

412
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
>> YOU NEVER THINK YOU'RE NEVER

413
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
GOING TO SEE THEM AGAIN.

414
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
THAT'S THE WORST PART ABOUT IT.

415
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
>> HOW IS EVERYONE AROUND HERE

416
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
DEALING WITH IT?

417
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
YOUR NEIGHBORS, ARE YOU TALKING

418
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
ABOUT IT?
DO THEY FEEL THE SAME AS YOU?

419
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
>> YEAH, MY FAMILY'S BEEN

420
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
CALLING, MY WIFE'S FAMILY BEEN

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
CALLING US ASKING US IF WE KNEW

422
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
ANYBODY.

423
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I WORK RELATIVELY CLOSE IN

424
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
DANBURY.
I'M SURE I HAVEN'T HEARD YET IF

425
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
ANYBODY'S BEEN AFFECTED BY

426
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE BUT I'M

427
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
SURE NEXT WEEK I'LL PROBABLY

428
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
HEAR SOMETHING.

429
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
>> YOU BARELY OPENED YOUR MOUTH

430
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
BEFORE YOU STARTED TO TEAR UP.

431
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I CAN SEE BEHIND THE SUNGLASSES

432
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
AND YOU SEE THIS BIG LUG OF GUYS

433
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
WHO CAN BARELY GET THEIR WORDS

434
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
OUT.

435
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
>> YEAH, IT'S DIFFICULT.

436
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
ESPECIALLY BEING SO CLOSE TO

437
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
HOME.
IT MAKES IT EVEN THAT MUCH MORE

438
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
DIFFICULT.

439
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
>> YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE FOLKS

440
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
HERE, IF ANYTHING?

441
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
IS THERE YOU CAN SAY TO THEM?

442
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THERE REALLY

443
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
IS ANYTHING.

444
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I GUESS STAY STRONG BUT IT SEEMS

445
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
SO HARD TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW.

446
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
IT'S STILL KIND OF FRESH.

447
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
>> WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE THE

448
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
COUNTRY TO KNOW OR DO TO SUPPORT

449
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
THIS COMMUNITY?

450
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
>> PRAYERS, LOTS OF PRAYERS I

451
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
THINK RIGHT NOW, ESPECIALLY THE

452
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
WEEK BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND

453
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
HANUKKAH, AND EVERYONE JUST

454
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE

455
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
SOMETHING DIFFERENT, I'M SURE.

456
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
>> THANK YOU, GUYS.

457
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
THANKS FOR COMING ON AND SHOWING

458
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
YOUR SUPPORT.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> IT MEANS THE WORLDED I'M SURE

459
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
TO THE FOLKS HERE.

460
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
THAT'S KRISTIN AND MATT AND

461
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
THEIR 1-YEAR-OLD OLIVIA.

462
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
THEY ARE JUST ONE AMONG MANY

463
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SHOWING UP

464
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
HERE TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS, AND

465
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
AS I SAID, THE CHURCH HERE, THE

466
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
METHODIST CHURCH OPEN 24 HOURS

467
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
AND THEY'VE ASKED THE MEDIA NOT

468
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
TO INTERVIEW PEOPLE.
SO IF THEY COME OUT AND THEY

469
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
WANT TO TALK LIKE THIS COUPLE

470
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
DID, THEN WE WILL TALK TO THEM.

471
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
IF YOU GO DOWN HERE TO BETH

472
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
SQUARE, THERE'S A SIGN THAT SAYS

473
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN.

474
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
IS THE STREET THAT LEADS UP TO

475
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
THE SCHOOL BLOCKED OFF BY

476
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
POLICE.
ANDTOM EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT

477
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'VE SPOKEN TO, SAYS, YOU KNOW,

478
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
IT'S NEVER THIS BUSY HERE

479
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
ESPECIALLY ON A SATURDAY OR A

480
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
SUNDAY.
IT GETS A LITTLE BIT BUSY

481
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE SQUARES

482
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
HERE IN THE TOWN BUT NOT THIS

483
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
BUSY.
SO PEOPLE ARE COMING HERE

484
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
BECAUSE THEY'RE SEEING IT ON

485
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
TELEVISION AND WANT TO GIVE THIS

486
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
COMMUNITY A COMMUNITY GROUP HUG,

487
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
SO TO SPEAK.

488
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE

489
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
PEOPLE COMING OUT HERE SO THAT

490
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
YOU CAN HEAR HOW THEY'RE GETTING

491
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
SUPPORT HERE IN NEWTOWN,

492
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
CONNECTICUT.
AS I MENTIONED JUST A LITTLE BIT

493
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
EARLIER AS WE SADLY HAVE TO GO

494
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
BACK TO THIS GUNMAN, HE FORCED

495
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
HIS WAY INTO SANDY HOOK

496
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
NO ONE LET HIM IN VOLUNTARILY.

497
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
HE FORCED HIS WAY IN.

498
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
THE SCHOOL RECENTLY INSTALLED A

499
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
NEW SECURITY SYSTEM THAT LOCKED

500
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
DOORS AT 9:30 A.M. AND VISITORS

501
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
WERE SUPPOSED TO RING A BELL AND

502
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
GET CLEARANCE FROM THE FRONT

503
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
OFFICE.
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE

504
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
SHOOTER BURST INTO THE SCHOOL

505
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
AND STARTED HIS BLOODY RAMPAGE

506
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
BEFORE OR AFTER 9:00 A.M.

507
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
LOU PA LUMBO, A RETIRED NASSAU

508
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
COUNTY POLICE OFFICER IN NEW

509
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
YORK, HE NOW HEADS A SECURITY

510
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
AGENCY, LOU, WE STARTED THIS

511
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
YESTERDAY ON THE AIR.

512
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
HAD NO IDEA WHEN WE WERE

513
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
COVERING THIS BOTH OF US, I HAD

514
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
ONE LINE OF INFORMATION THAT

515
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
SAID POLICE ARE RUSHING TO THE

516
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
SCENE OF A SCHOOL FOR A POSSIBLE

517
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
SHOOTING, AND AS YOU AND I WERE

518
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
TALKING YESTERDAY MORNING, AND

519
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
NOW THIS.

520
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
ONE MORE, ANOTHER SCHOOL
TRAGEDY.

521
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
>> DON, ALMOST INDESCRIBABLE AND

522
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
DIFFICULT TO SPEAK TO.

523
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
THE REAL PROBLEM IS WHAT THIS IS

524
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
SYMPTOM I CAN OF.

525
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
THERE'S AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF

526
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
DYSFUNCTION IN OUR COUNTRY.

527
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
WE NEED TO JUST WRAP OUR ARMS

528
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
AROUND IT, WHETHER IT'S OUR

529
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
INABILITY TO TALK ABOUT

530
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
RESPONSIBLE REGULATION HOW

531
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
PEOPLE ACQUIRE FIREARMS, WHAT WE

532
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
NEED TO DO TO SECURE OUR

533
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
SCHOOLS, OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM,

534
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
YOU KNOW, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

535
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
GUN LEGISLATION AND ASSAULT

536
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
RIFLE BANS.

537
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN TALK

538
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

539
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED

540
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
HOUSE AND I'M CERTAIN A NUMBER

541
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
OF SOUTHERN CONSERVATIVE
DEMOCRATS WHO ARE NOT GOING TO

542
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
VOTE FOR ANY GUN LAWS WITH THIS

543
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
PRESIDENT.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE IN A REAL

544
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
QUAGMIRE HERE.

545
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
YOU WOULD HOPE AT SOME POINT

546
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
SENSIBILITY WOULD OVERRIDE THIS

547
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
AND THE TWO EXTREMES ON THIS

548
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
PLATFORM COME TO THE MIDDLE TO

549
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO ADDRESS

550
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
THIS PROBLEM OF THE

551
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
INAPPROPRIATE MANNER IN WHICH

552
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
PEOPLE ACQUIRE FIREARMS.

553
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
IT ISN'T JUST THROUGH PURCHASING

554
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
THEM IN A GUN STORE.

555
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
AND THESE LAST TWO INSTANCES,

556
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
BOTH IN OREGON, AND NOW IN

557
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
CONNECTICUT, WE HAD YOUNG MEN IN

558
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
OREGON BREAK INTO A HOME AND

559
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
STEAL AN ASSAULT RIFLE AND IN
THIS INSTANCE, THIS YOUNG MAN

560
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
ACQUIRED AN ASSAULT RIFLE FROM

561
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
HIS HOME.

562
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
BOTH OF THEM UNSECURED.

563
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
YOU HAVE TO SAFEGUARD THESE

564
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
WEAPONS.

565
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
THAT'S ONE PROBLEM WE'RE HAVING

566
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
HERE.
THAT'S ALL -- THERE'S NO SUCH

567
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
THING AS SINGLE CAUSALITY.

568
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
THERE ISN'T ANY MAGIC WAND OR

569
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
ANY GUN LAW THAT'S GOING TO FIX

570
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
THIS DON.
THIS IS SO DISCONCERTING.

571
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
>> LOU?

572
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
>> YES.

573
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
>> LOU, CAN WE PUT THE GUNS, A

574
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
PICTURE OF THAT GUN BACK UP.

575
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I WANT TO TELL OF MY EXPERIENCE

576
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
HERE.

577
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
LOU, WHEN I WAS IN COLORADO,

578
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
COVERING THAT THEATER MASSACRE,

579
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
THE GUN THAT YOU SEE AT THE

580
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, IF YOU CAN

581
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
PUT IT BACK UP, THAT AR-15, YOU

582
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
SUE HE THAT?

583
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
>> THAT'S TO BE MORE ACCURATE,

584
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
THAT'S AN M-4 CARBINE, IT'S AN

585
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
M-4 CARBINE.

586
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
>> OKAY.

587
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I WENT INTO A GUN STORE AND

588
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
PURCHASED A GUN THAT LOOKS

589
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
PRETTY MUCH LIKE THAT GUN.

590
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
WITHIN 20 MINUTES, I'M NOT A

591
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
RESIDENT OF THE STATE OF

592
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
COLORADO.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DID WITH

593
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
THE BACKGROUND CHECK.

594
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
THEY LOOKED AT MY DRIVER'S

595
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
LICENSE.

596
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I HANDED THEM $800.

597
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
AND WALKED OUT OF THE STORE WITH

598
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
A GUN THAT LOOKS LIKE THAT GUN

599
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
AND AMMUNITION AND TO THIS DAY,

600
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
IT'S SITTING IN THE CNN SECURITY

601
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
OFFICE, BUT STILL, HOW CAN

602
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
SOMEONE JUST WALK INTO A STORE

603
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
AND 20 MINUTES LATER WALK OUT

604
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
WITH AN ASSAULT RIFLE?

605
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN IN THIS

606
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
COUNTRY?
>> WE HAVE A FAILED SYSTEM, DON.

607
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH

608
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
NUMEROUS CORRESPONDENTS AND

609
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
JOURNALISTS, SOME OF THEM WITH

610
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
CNN.
THE PROBLEM SIMPLY STATED IS

611
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
THAT WITH HANDGUNS, FOR EXAMPLE,

612
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
IF YOU HAVE NO CRIMINAL HISTORY,

613
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
WE'RE PREPARED TO SURRENDER ONE

614
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
TO YOU ON A DRIVER'S LICENSE.

615
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, BEFORE WE

616
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
ARM OUR POLICE, WE VET THEM A

617
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
BIT DIFFERENTLY.

618
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH CRIMINAL

619
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
HISTORY CHECK.

620
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILING WHERE WE

621
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
PUT YOU THROUGH A MINNESOTA

622
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
MULTIFACIC SCREENING, RORSCHACH,

623
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
WORD ASSOCIATION AND INTERVIEWS

624
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
WITH PSYCHOLOGISTS AND

625
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
PSYCHIATRISTS.
THEN EXTENSIVE FIREARMS TRAINING

626
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
AND IN ADDITION CLASSROOM

627
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
TRAINING EXPLAINING TO YOU USE

628
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
OF FORCE.

629
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
DEADLY PHYSICAL FORCE IN

630
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
PARTICULAR.
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF

631
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
WALKING INTO CERTAIN STATES IN

632
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
THIS COUNTRY AND BUYING WEAPONS

633
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
OF THIS TYPE WITHOUT US KNOWING

634
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU IS

635
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
REPREHENSIBLE AND IT'S ONE OF

636
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
THE PROBLEMS THAT NEEDS TO BE

637
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
ADDRESSED.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO GO IN THE

638
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
FORMAT OF A GUN LAW.

639
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
YOU KNOW, MY POSITION ON THIS

640
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
WHOLE TOPIC AT THIS POINT IS IT

641
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
SEEMS TO BE WRAPPED AROUND A

642
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SECOND

643
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
AMENDMENT.

644
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'D LOVE TO SEE THE FEDERAL

645
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
GOVERNMENT COME IN AND REQUIRE

646
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
PROPER VETTING OF PEOPLE THAT

647
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
WOULD LIKE HANDGUNS OR IF YOU

648
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
REALLY FEEL THIS NEED ASSAULT

649
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
RIFLES SO WE KNOW SOMETHING

650
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
ABOUT YOU, LITTLE MORE THAN THE

651
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
FACT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ARRESTED.

652
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
AND THEN WE GO THROUGH THE

653
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
EDUCATIONAL PROCESS OF

654
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
IMPRESSING UPON YOU THE

655
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
IMPORTANCE OF SAFEGUARDING THESE

656
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
WEAPONS.
THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM.

657
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
BUT IT CAN BE ADDRESSED.

658
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
THE UNFORTUNATE PART, DON, IT'S

659
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
A POLITICAL ISSUE AND IT

660
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
SHOULDN'T BE.
WE'RE SUFFERING THE

661
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
CONSEQUENCES.

662
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
>> IT'S NOT AND IT SHOULDN'T BE.

663
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LEFT

664
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
OR RIGHT.

665
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DON'T

666
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
GET.
IF YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

667
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
NOW PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA ARE

668
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
SAYING YOU'RE SUCH A LEFTY

669
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
LIBERAL.

670
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'M NOT.
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.

671
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
IT IS A COMMON SENSE ISSUE.

672
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
LISTEN IN, THAT CONVERSATION
WITH YOU AND THIS IS A REAL

673
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
CONVERSATION.
I WARNED THE VIEWERS BEFORE

674
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A REAL

675
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
CONVERSATION HERE.

676
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I SMOEED MY IGNORANCE ABOUT GUNS

677
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW, ONE

678
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
ASSAULT RIFLE LOOKS THE SAME TO

679
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
ME.
SO SOMEONE LIKE ME, LOU, WHO HAS

680
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
NEVER TAKEN A GUN CLASS, NEVER

681
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
GONE TO A GUN RANGE EXCEPT TO DO

682
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
A STORY AND MAYBE SHOT A GUN

683
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
ONCE OR TWICE, TO BE ABLE TO GO

684
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
IN AND THE AMMUNITION AND I

685
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
COULD WALK OUT AND IF I WAS MAD

686
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
AT SOMEONE JUST GO FIRE AT

687
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
PEOPLE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

688
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
THAT HAPPENS IN A COUNTRY.

689
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
FORGIVE ME, THAT'S NOT A LEFT OR

690
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
RIGHT THING.

691
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
>> I'VE SPENT 39 YEARS IN THE

692
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY AS AN

693
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
ACTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENT.

694
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
AND I'VE BEEN PROTECTING PEOPLE

695
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
FOR THE PAST 32 YEARS PRIVATELY.

696
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
A LOT OF THIS ELUDES ME, AS

697
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
WELL.
BUT WHAT REALLY ELUDES ME IS OUR

698
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
ABILITY TO SIT DOWN AND COME TO

699
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
COMMON GROUND BETWEEN THE TWO
EXTREMES THAT EXIST IN THE

700
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
COUNTRY.
ONE IS THE NRA THAT BELIEVE IF

701
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
YOU CAN SEE LIGHTNING AND HEAR

702
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
THUNDER, YOU SHOULD OWN A GUN

703
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
AND THEN THE EXTREME LEFT

704
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
LIBERALS THAT THINK WE'RE JUST

705
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
GOING TO WAVE THE MAGIC WAND AND

706
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
ERASE 300 MILLION FIREARMS THAT

707
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF TODAY.

708
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN IN THE

709
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
MIDDLE.

710
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
>> NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

711
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY THE TRUTH

712
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
HERE.
THAT'S WHY IN A SENSE WE'RE

713
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
SPINNING OUR WHEELS.

714
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
THERE IS A REMEDY TO THE

715
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
PROBLEM.
PART OF IT REVOLVES AROUND OUR

716
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
ABILITY TO PROPERLY VET PEOPLE

717
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
AND CONTINUOUS EDUCATION WITH

718
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
PEOPLE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE

719
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
ARE TAUGHT AND IT'S IMPRESSED

720
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
UPON US THE NEED TO SAFEGUARD

721
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
YOUR WEAPONS.
THE REST OF AMERICA IS ON A

722
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
WHOLE ANOTHER PAGE.

723
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
WE'RE ON ONE PAGE, THEY'RE ON

724
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
ANOTHER.

725
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
WE GO THROUGH ONE VETTING

726
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
PROCESS, THEY GO THROUGH

727
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
BASICALLY NONE.

728
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
THIS IS THE DISCONNECT.

729
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
>> LOU?
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE IT

730
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
THERE.
I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION.

731
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
AND I KNOW HOW YOU'RE FEELING

732

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
DIARRHEA, GAS, BLOATING?

915
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
YEAH.

916
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
ONE Phillips' Colon Health

HELPS DEFEND

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
APPROVED!

Phillips'.

922
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
>>> THOSE CHILDREN WHO WERE AT

923
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
THE SCHOOL AT THE TIME OF THE

924
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
SHOOTING WILL CERTAINLY HAVE A

925
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
LOT OF QUESTIONS, AND PARENTS

926
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO ANSWER

927
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
THEM.

928
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
AND THAT IS WHY I WANT TO

929
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
BRINGING IN JEFF GARDERE TO TALK

930
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
ABOUT HOW ONE EXPLAINS THIS

931
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
TRAGEDY TO CHILDREN.

932
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
HE'S A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST.

933
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THIS

934
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
EXPLAINING THIS TO A CHILD,

935
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT

936
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
GUN LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY AND

937
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
ABOUT SOMEHOW MAKING SURE THAT

938
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
THE -- THEY DON'T GET IN THE

939
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
HANDS OF THE WRONG PEOPLE.

940
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I THINK IT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT

941
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH, A

942
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
SUBJECT THAT'S BEEN COMING UP

943
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

944
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
SO WHERE DO WE START HERE THEN?

945
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
BECAUSE I GUESS IS NEBULOUS A

946
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
RIGHT, RIGHT WORD OR COMPLEX IS

947
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
PROBABLY THE RIGHT WORD WHEN IT

948
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
COMES TO DEALING WITH MENTAL

949
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
HEALTH ISSUES.
>> YES, IT IS VERY COMPLEX.

950
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
AND THIS BRINGS UP A VERY

951
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
EXCELLENT POINT AND I'M SO GLAD,

952
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
DON, THAT YOU'RE ASKING THIS

953
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
QUESTION.
YOU HAD A PREVIOUS GUEST WHO

954
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
SAID LOOK, WHEN IT COMES TO

955
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS, WE HAVE TO

956
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
LOOK AT MINNESOTA MULL FACIC

957
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
PERSONALITY INVENTORY WHICH

958
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
GIVES US A BROAD SPECTRUM AS TO

959
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
WHO THE PERSON IS, SOME OF THE

960
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROJECTIVE TESTS

961
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
AND SO ON.

962
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
HE IS RIGHT ON WITH THAT BECAUSE

963
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
RIGHT NOW ONE OF THE ONLY

964
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
QUESTIONS ASKED WHEN YOU'RE

965
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
GETTING A GUN PERMIT DURING THE

966
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
GUN APPLICATION IS, HAVE YOU

967
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
EVER BEEN DECLARED INCOMPETENT

968
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
OR HAVE YOU EVER BEEN

969
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
INVOLUNTARY PLACED IN A MENTAL

970
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
INSTITUTION.

971
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
AND MOST PEOPLE WILL JUST SAY NO

972
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
AND LEAVE IT ALONE.

973
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
THEN THE PERSON WILL CALL IN A

974
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
BACKGROUND CHECK WITH THE FBI OR

975
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
SOME OTHER AGENCY.

976
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS, THREE

977
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PLACED

978
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
IN HOSPITALS FOR PSYCHIATRIC

979
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
REASONS.
BUT ONLY 90,000 OF THOSE PEOPLE

980
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
ARE IN THAT DATABASE.

981
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
SO THERE'S A HUGE HOLE THERE.

982
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
AND SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS

983
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
YEAH, OKAY, SO LET'S LOOK AT

984
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL

985
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
ILLNESS BUT A LOT OF TIMES THE

986
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
PEOPLE THAT COMMIT THESE CRIMES,

987
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
YOU CAN'T DOCUMENT THAT THEY

988
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
WERE IN A HOSPITAL.

989
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
THEY WERE NEVER IN A PSYCHIATRIC

990
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
HOSPITAL.
THEY WERE FLYING UNDER THE

991
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
RADAR.

992
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
AND WE KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN

993
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
OTHER INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE

994
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
HAVE NOT BEEN PSYCHOTIC WHO HAVE

995
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
TAKEN MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN

996
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
HANDS AND BEEN INVOLVED WITH

997
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
MASS MURDERS AND THESE HAVE --

998
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
THESE PEOPLE ONLY HAVE

999
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
PERSONALITY DISORDERS AND ARE

1000
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
NOT PSYCHOTIC.

1001
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
SO I THINK WE'RE KIND OF MISSING

1002
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
THE BOAT HERE.

1003
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
THERE ARE VIOLENT PEOPLE WHO

1004
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
DON'T HAVE SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH

1005
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
ISSUES.
JUST TO LOOK AT PEOPLE WITH

1006
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AS BEING

1007
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
THE ONES WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE

1008
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
GUNS, I THINK IT HAS TO GO MUCH

1009
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
BROADER THAN THAT AND WE HAVE TO

1010
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
LOOK AT THE WHOLE PERSONALITY,

1011
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
NOT PEOPLE JUST WITH MENTAL

1012
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
HEALTH ISSUES.

1013
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
>> THERE YOU GO.

1014
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
LISTEN, IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

1015
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
THE GUN LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY AND

1016
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
SOMEHOW TRYING TO KEEP THEM OUT

1017
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

1018
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
NOT SUITABLE TO OWN THEM OR OH

1019
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
SES THEM, THE TWO -- IT'S NOT

1020
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

1021
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE OTHER.

1022
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
YOU WANT TO KEEP IT OUT OF THE

1023
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
HANDS OF PEOPLE THAT AREN'T

1024
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
MENTALLY STABLE.

1025
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
THAT'S A CONVERSATION WE SHOULD

1026
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
BE HAVING AROUND THE COUNTRY AND

1027
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
QUITE FRANKLY OUR CONGRESS

1028
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
SHOULD BE HAVING, AS WELL.

1029
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CHILDREN

1030
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
NOW, THE YOUNGEST AMONG US,

1031
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
SADLY 20 OF THEM DIED IN THIS.

1032
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS KIND OF

1033
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
TRAGEDY TO A CHILD, ESPECIALLY A

1034
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
CHILD WHO MAY HAVE WITNESSED

1035
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
THIS, WHO WAS IN THE SCHOOL?

1036
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
>> WELL, IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW

1037
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
THAT TOO OFTEN, WE THINK

1038
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
CHILDREN ARE RESILIENT AND IF

1039
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

1040
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
SOMETHING, THEN THEY'RE NOT
EXPERIENCING IT, BUT THE KIDS IN

1041
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
THAT SCHOOL, THE KIDS IN THAT

1042
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
TOWN AND EVEN THE KIDS WHO ARE

1043
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
IN OTHER CITIES ARE PROCESSING

1044
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
THIS, ARE GOING THROUGH THIS,

1045
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
AND THEY NEED FOR US TO REACH

1046
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
OUT TO THEM SO THE FIRST AND

1047
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO

1048
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
STOG FIND OUT WHAT IT IS THAT

1049
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS TRAUMA,

1050
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
WHAT IT IS THAT THEY ARE

1051
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
THINKING ABOUT, WHAT IT IS THAT

1052
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
THEY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, AND

1053
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THEN BEGIN YOUR DISCUSSION THERE

1054
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
INSTEAD OF GOING INTO A STRAIGHT

1055
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
DIALOGUE OR PREACHING TO THEM AS

1056
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
TO WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND THE

1057
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
EVILS OF GUNS AND SO ON.

1058
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
THEY MAY NOT BE THERE YET.

1059
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
SO BE WHERE THEY ARE, AND BEGIN

1060
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
THAT CONVERSATION WITH THEM.

1061
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
AND SECONDLY, AND MOST

1062
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
IMPORTANTLY, IT'S NOT ONE

1063
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
CONVERSATION, DON.
YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS

1064
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
BEFORE.
IT REALLY IS A SERIES OF

1065
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
CONVERSATIONS AND IT'S NOT THAT

1066
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
YOU SIT HERE AND I'LL SIT THERE

1067
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
AND LET'S TALK, BUT IT'S ABOUT

1068
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
DOING OTHER ACTIVITIES, COOKING

1069
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
WITH YOUR KIDS, EXERCISING WITH

1070
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
YOUR KIDS, PLAYING WITH YOUR

1071
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
KIDS.
AND THEN BRINGING UP THESE

1072
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS AND

1073
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
MAKING SURE IT'S INTERACTIONAL

1074
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
WHERE THEY'RE DOING A LOT OF THE

1075
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
TALKING, YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF

1076
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
THE LISTENING, BUT BEING HONEST

1077
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
WITH THEM AND LETTING THEM KNOW

1078
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING VERY

1079
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO DISCUSS

1080
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
WITH THEM, TOO, AND IT'S OKAY TO

1081
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
SAY, I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT COMES

1082
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
TO CERTAIN THINGS WHY CERTAIN

1083
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
THINGS HAPPEN, BUT LET'S TALK

1084
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
ABOUT IT, LET'S TRY TO FIGURE IT

1085
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
OUT TOGETHER.

1086
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING, THE

1087
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
COMMUNICATION.
>> LISTEN, JEFF, IF AT THIS

1088
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
POINT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY IN

1089
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
THIS COUNTRY ALL OF US

1090
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
WITNESSING IT, IF WE CAN'T SIT

1091
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
DOWN AND HAVE A CONVERSATION

1092
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
RIGHT NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHEN

1093
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT.

1094
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
IF THIS DOESN'T MOVE PEOPLE TO

1095
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
DO THAT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL.

1096
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
>> WELL, WE HAVE TO STRIKE WHILE

1097
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
THE IRON IS HOT.

1098
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I'M ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO SAID

1099
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
PERHAPS YESTERDAY IT WAS TOO

1100
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
SOON TO BE TALKING ABOUT WHAT

1101
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
SOCIETY NEEDS TO DO IN ORDER TO

1102
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES.

1103
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
IT'S NOT TOO SOON NOW.

1104
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
WE WANT PEOPLE TO GRIEVE.

1105
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
WE WANT THEM TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

1106
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
THEY'RE EXPERIENCING.

1107
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
GOD BLESS THOSE FAMILIES THERE

1108
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
IN CONNECTICUT.

1109
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
BUT WE HAVE TO BEGIN THE

1110
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
DISCUSSION NOW, STRIKE WHILE

1111
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
THAT IRON IS HOT.

1112
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
>> YEAH, LISTEN.

1113
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

1114
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I THINK IT'S DISRESPECTFUL NOT

1115
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
TO TALK ABOUT IT WHEN 20 KIDS

1116
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
HAVE DIED, SIX ADULTS.

1117
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I THINK IT'S DISRESPECT IN NOT

1118
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE INSTEAD

1119
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
OF SAYING LET'S NOT THE RIGHT

1120
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
TIME.

1121
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
IT IS THE RIGHT TIME.

1122
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
WHEN IS IT GOING TO BE THE RIGHT

1123
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
TIME?

1124
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000

1130
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
CONVERSATION TO HAVE WITH KIDS

1131
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000

CLINTON APPARENTLY HIT HER HEAD

1137
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
AFTER SHE FAINTED.

1138
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000

1157

SINCE THE 2010 WORLD CUP THAT

1158
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
WAS HOSTED BY SOUTH AFRICA.

1159
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000

THE CONTROVERSIAL DOCUMENT

1164

SHOULD GO INTO EFFECT.

1165
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
THE DAYS LEADING UP TO THE VOTE

1166
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
HAVE BEEN MARRED BY MANY

1167
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000

1180
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
BREAK.

1181
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I GET A CHANCE TO CHECK IT.

1182
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
GUESS WHAT, PEOPLE ARE EAGER TO

1183
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION EVEN THE

1184
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
PEOPLE WHO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT,

1185
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
THE GUN LAWS ARE FINE THE WAY

1186
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
THEY ARE NOW AND THE FOLKS HOG

1187
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
ARE SAYING THEY'RE NOT FINE THE

1188
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
WAY THEY ARE.

1189
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
IT'S OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO TALK

1190
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
ABOUT AND IT WOULD BE VERY

1191
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
DISRESPECTFUL NOT TO TALK ABOUT

1192
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
IT AT THIS POINT AND SOCIAL

1193
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
MEDIA IS DOING ITTING.

1194
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
>> PEOPLE CAN SAY WHAT THEY WANT

1195
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
WHETHER THIS CONVERSATION SHOULD

1196
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
EXIST RIGHT NOW OR NOT.

1197
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
CAT'S OUT OF THE BAG.

1198
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS.

1199
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
AND THE DEBATE ISN'T BETWEEN

1200
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
PEOPLE WHO SAY GUN LAWS ARE

1201
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
PERFECT AND DON'T NEED TO BE

1202
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
CHANGED.
IT'S MORE PEOPLE WHO SAY WE NEED

1203
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
TO FOCUS ON GUN LAWS WHILE

1204
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
OTHERS SAY WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

1205
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
THINGS LIKE MENTAL ILLNESS.

1206
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
THIS DEBATE IS NOW BECOMING A

1207
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
PART OF THE STORY AS THE COUNTRY

1208
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
AND THE WORLD REALLY FEEL THIS

1209
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
TRAUMA.
LET MOO TAKE YOU FIRST TO A

1210
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
QUOTE WE HAVE NOW, A LITTLE

1211
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
PIECE OF SOUND FROM AN

1212
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I-REPORTER WHO SAYS HE'S A BIG
FAN OF GUN RIGHTS.

1213
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
>> YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT

1214
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
THE SECOND AMENDMENT.

1215
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
THEY TALK ABOUT THE RIGHT TO

1216
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
BEAR ARMS.

1217
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I TRULY BELIEVE IN THAT.

1218
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT AMERICA

1219
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
SHOULD ARM THE SCHOOLS.

1220
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
OUR TEACHERS OUR PRINCIPALS

1221
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
SHOULD HAVE -- SHOULD HAVE A WAY

1222
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
TO DEFEND OUR CHILDREN.

1223
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
>> SUGGESTIONS OF ARMING PEOPLE

1224
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
IN SCHOOLS, SOMETHING A LOT OF

1225
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
PEOPLE ARE PUTTING OUT THERE.

1226
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I WANT TO BRING YOU AN EXAMPLE

1227
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000

>> FIRST ONE IS OWNING LIVE

1231
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
AMMUNITION.
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE MADE

1232
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
ILLEGAL.

1233
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
PEOPLE THAT DO OWN, WANT TO OWN

1234
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
A GUN OR SOME KIND OF A FIREARM

1235
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
FOR THE PROTECTION OF THEMSELVES

1236
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
OR THEIR FAMILY SHOULD OWN ONE.

1237
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
HOWEVER, THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO

1238
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
HAVE LETHAL AMMUNITION.

1239
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
THERE ARE STUN GUNS, RUBBER

1240
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
BULLETS, TASER GUNS THAT CAN BE

1241
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000

IT'S SAD BUT PEOPLE TRULY DON'T

1257
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
CARE IF THEY WANTED TO END THE

1258
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
VIOLENCE, THEY HAD HAVE DONE

ABOUT AND KNOW THE SPECS OF HOW

1277

GUN LAWS CURRENTLY OPERATE OF

1278
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE OF WHAT

1279
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
MAY HAVE OR MAY NOT HAVE APPLIED

1280
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
IN THE CASES OF OTHER RECENT

1281
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
HORRIFYING INCIDENTS.

1282
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
WE'RE SEEING AN ABSOLUTELY

1283
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
HORRIFIC TIME LINE.

1284
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I'LL TELL YOU ONE MORE THING,

1285
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
WITH ALL THE MASS SHOOTINGS WE

1286
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
HAVE THIS IN COUNTRY WITH ALL

1287
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
THE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS WE HAVE

1288
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
SEEN, WE TAKE YOU THROUGH HOW

1289
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
MANY THERE HAVE BEEN, IT'S A

1290
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
NIGHTMARE.
THE FACT IS I HAVE NEVER SEEN A

1291
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
MOMENT LIKE THIS IN THIS COUNTRY

1292
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
IN WHICH PEOPLE SEEM TO BE

1293
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
REALIZING IT IS SO DEEP, IS IT

1294
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
IS SUCH A HUGE NATIONAL PROBLEM

1295
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY TIME THAT

1296
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
WE ACT.

1297
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I THINK WE MIGHT SEE SOME ACTION

1298
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
THIS TIME.

1299
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
>> IT IS -- IT'S LISTEN, JOSH,

1300
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I'VE NEVER SEEN PEOPLE AS

1301
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
PASSIONATE ABOUT IT ON SOCIAL

1302
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
MEDIA.
LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THIS.

1303
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

1304
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
SOMEONE SAYS SALUTE.

1305
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I SALUTE YOU FOR USING THIS

1306
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
PLATFORM TO DISCUSS OUR OBSCENE

1307
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
GUN LAWS AND DEMAND A COMMON

1308
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
SENSE APPROACH.

1309
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
WHY SHOULD WE HAVE A DEBATE

1310
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL OR MENTAL

1311
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
HEALTH TREATMENT?

1312
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
THERE ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT

1313
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
COMMON SENSE.

1314
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
KEEP ASKING THE QUESTION.

1315
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
WHY ISN'T THIS THE RIGHT TIME TO

1316
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
HAVE A CONVERSATION?

1317
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
WHEN WOULD THERE BE A BETTER

1318
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
TIME?

1319
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
JOSH, I THINK SOCIAL MEDIA HAS

1320
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
IT RIGHT, RIGHT NOW.

1321
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
IF WE CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION

1322
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
AT THE RIGHT TIME ISN'T AFTER 20

1323
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
KIDS WERE SHOT UP IN THE SCHOOL

1324
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
AND KILLED, THEN WHEN IS THE

1325
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
RIGHT TIME?

1326
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I THINK SOCIAL MEDIA HAS IT

1327
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
RIGHT.

1335
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000

ANOTHER ONE.

1353
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
That was ME...

1380
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
the day I learned I had
to start insulin

1381
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
for my type 2 diabetes.

1382
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
ME...

1383
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
thinking my only option was the
vial and syringe dad used.

1384
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
And ME...

1385
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
discovering once-daily
Levemir® FlexPen.

1386
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
FlexPen® is prefilled.

1387
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Doesn't need
refrigeration
for up to
42 days.

1388
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
No drawing from a vial.

1389
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Dial the exact dose.

1390
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Inject by pushing a button.

1391
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
FlexPen® is insulin delivery...

1393
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Levemir® (insulin detemir
[rDNA origin] injection)

1394
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
is a long-acting insulin

1395
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
used to control high blood sugar
in adults and children

1396
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
with diabetes and is not
recommended to treat

1397
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
diabetic ketoacidosis.

1398
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Do not use Levemir® if
you are allergic

1399
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
to any of its ingredients.

1400
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
The most common side effect
is low blood sugar,

1401
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
which may cause
symptoms such as sweating,

1402
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
shakiness, confusion,
and headache.

1403
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Severe low blood sugar can be
serious and life threatening.

1404
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Ask your healthcare provider
about alcohol use,

1405
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
operating machinery, or driving.

1406
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Other possible side
effects include

1407
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
injection site reactions.

1408
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Tell your healthcare provider
about all medicines you take

1409
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
and all of your
medical conditions.

1410
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Get medical help right away

serious allergic
reactions, such as body rash,

1412
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
trouble with breathing, fast
heartbeat, or sweating.

1413
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
With FlexPen®... say good night

>> IT WAS TERRIFYING.

1455
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I'M STILL TERRIFIED.

1456
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I THINK I'M STILL IN SHOCK ABOUT

1457
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
IT ALL.

1458
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I STILL DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING

1459
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
THAT HAPPENED.

1460
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I KNOW THERE'S SOME PEOPLE

1461
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
MISSING THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO

1462
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
THE HOSPITAL.

1463
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
IT'S TERRIFYING.

1464
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RUSHING OVER

1465
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
HERE AND YOU CAN'T GET TO WHERE

1466
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
YOU NEED TO GO.

1467
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
>> WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVED THERE,

1468
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF SECURITY

1469
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
TO GUARD.

1470
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
AND THERE WERE THREE CHILDREN

1471
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
THAT CAME OUT, ONE OF THEM

1472
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
WAS -- HAD A VERY BLOODY FACE.

1473
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
IT WAS VERY VIOLENT SCENE AND

1474
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
THERE WERE TWO OTHER ONES THAT

1475
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
THEY WERE, YOU KNOW, THEY WERE

1476
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
IN THE ARMS OF A SAY THE

1477
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
TROOPER.

1478
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
THEY DID NOT MOVE.

1479
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
THEIR FACE WAS VERY PALE.

1480
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
IT WAS VERY TRAGIC.

1481
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
>> DEB FEYERICK IS BACK AT THE

1482
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
CNN HEADQUARTERS IN ATLANTA.

1483
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I COVER

1484
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
THESE STORIES WHEN I SEE THE

1485
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
FAMILY MEMBERS OF SOME OF THE

1486
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
VICTIMS I WONDER HOW THEY'RE

1487
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
EVEN ABLE TO TALK AND STILL

1488
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
STANDING AT THIS POINT.

1489
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
>> YEAH, IT TAKES EVERY OUNCE OF

1490
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
STRENGTH YOU HAVE NOT TO JUST

1491
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
GIVE UP AND GIVE IN.

1492
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

1493
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
WRESTLE WITH THE PAIN FOR A

1494
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
VERY, VERY LONG TIME.

1495
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
WE'VE SEEN IT OVER AND OVER

1496
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
AGAIN, DON.

1497
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
NEVER AGAIN, WE SAY THAT AFTER

1498
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
EVERY SHOOTING, BUT YET, HERE WE

1499
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
ARE ONCE AGAIN.

1500
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
MASS SCHOOL SHOOTINGS NOT JUST A

1501
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
NIGHTMARE BUT A REALITY THAT ARE

1502
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
BECOMING ALL TOO FAMILIAR.

1503
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO SHOW YOU

1504
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
COULD SAVE YOUR CHILD'S LIFE.

BRIAN TODD TALKS WITH AN
SECURITY EXPERT.

1506
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
>> A NIGHTMARE SCENARIO FOR ANY

1507
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
SCHOOL SECURITY OFFICIAL.

1508
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
MICHAEL HAS IDEAS HOW TO AVOID

1509
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
MASS CASUALTIES IF A GUN MAB IS

1510
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
IN YOUR SCHOOL.

1511
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
HOW DO YOU RESPOND IF THERE ARE

1512
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
KIDS ALL AROUND?

1513
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
>> THAT'S WHERE THE TRAINING

1514
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
COMES IN.

PRINCE GEORGES PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN

1516
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
MARYLAND.
A FORMER DEPUTY POLICE CHIEF WHO

1517
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
ONCE HAD TO LOCK DOWN A SCHOOL.

1518
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
HE TOOK US THROUGH AN ELEMENTARY

1519
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
SCHOOL THAT OFFICIALS DIDN'T

1520
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
WANT US TO NAME.

1521
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
SHOWED US WHAT TO DO IF THE

1522
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
NIGHTMARE UNFOLDS.

1523
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
>> EXITS ARE KEY.

1524
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
FIND THE NEAREST ONE.

1525
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
>> ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.

1526
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE

1527
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
FAMILIAR WITH THE BUILDING.

1528
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
THAT'S WHY AGAIN, WE ENCOURAGE

1529
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
JUST LITTLE THINGS, JUST A

1530
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
BUILDING FAMILIARIZATION, JUST

1531
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
WALKING THE OUTSIDE OF THE

1532
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
BUILDING SO YOU KNOW IF YOU

1533
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
LEAVE THIS PARTICULAR DOOR, IF

1534
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
IT COMES TO A CREEK OR PARKING

1535
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
LOT OR A BUSY INTERSECTION.

1536
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
>> ADULTS AND STUDENTS HE SAYS

1537
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
HAVE TO HAVE THAT EXIT

1538
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
AWARENESS.
BUT IF YOU'RE STUCK INSIDE,

1539
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
MICHAEL BLOW SAYS WHILE

1540
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
BATHROOMS MAY BE A TEMPTING

1541
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
PLACE TO HIDE AT FIRST, NOT A

1542
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
GOOD IDEA.

1543
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
AS YOU CAN SEE, A VERY CONFINED

1544
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
SPACE AND USUALLY NO WAY OUT.

1545
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
COURTYARDS HE SAYS ARE EQUALLY

1546
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
TEMPTING BUT ALSO NOT THE BEST

1547
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
PLACES BECAUSE THEY'RE OFTEN

1548
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
ENCLOSED.
>> IF THIS IS A CLASSROOM,

1549
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
THERE'S A GUNMAN, WE'VE HEARD

1550
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
SHOTS, WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE

1551
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
IS, WHAT DO WE DO?

1552
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
DO WE LOCK, TURN LIGHTS OFF,

1553
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
CLOSE WINDOWS?

1554
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
>> CERTAINLY, THERE ARE A HOST

1555
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
OF THINGS WE WOULD DO IN AN PLJS

1556
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
THAT WOULD INCLUDE LOCKING DOORS

1557
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO

1558
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
FORTIFY THAT ENTRANCEWAY AS BEST

1559
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
AS WE CAN, AGAIN, IF THERE ARE

1560
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
NO SAFE ALTERNATIVES FOR

1561
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
EVACUATING THE BUILDING, AND

1562
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
THAT WAY, IF SOMEONE WAS TO WALK

1563
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
BY THE ROOM THAT THEY WON'T HAVE

1564
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
AN EASY SITE PICTURE OF ANYONE

1565
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
THAT IS IN THE ROOM.

1566
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
>> ADULTS IN THE ROOM HE SAYS

1567
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
SHOULD TALK THE KIDS THROUGH IT

1568
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
AS CALMLY AS POSSIBLE.

1569
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
>> WHAT ABOUT LARGE ROOMS LIKE

1570
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
GYMS?

1571
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
YOU GO IN, AVOID IT?

1572
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
>> AGAIN, THERE'S NOT A LOT OF

1573
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
PLACES TO CONCEAL YOURSELVES BUT

1574
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
THERE'S A WAY TO GET TO THE

1575
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING.
>> HE DIDN'T WANT TO GIVEAWAY

1576
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
TOO MANY PREEMPTIVE SECURITY

1577
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
MEASURES BUT SOMETIMES THEY USE

1578
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
WANDING DEVICES TO SCREEN

1579
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
STUDENTS.

1580
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
HE SAYS SOME OF THE BEST

1581
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
SCREENING IS AWARENESS OF WHO IS

1582
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
TROUBLED, WHO IS BEING BULL

1583
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
AUDIO, THE RADAR UP FOR

1584
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
POTENTIAL ASSAILANTS.

1585
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
BRIAN TODD, PRINCE GEORGES

1586
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
COUNTY, MARYLAND.

1587
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
>> AFTER THIS ALL HAPPENED

1588
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
YESTERDAY, THAT WAS ONE OF THE

1589
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
FIRST THINGS THAT I LIKE SO MANY

1590
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
OTHER PARENTS THOUGHT ABOUT.

1591
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
THAT IS, YOU KNOW, ARE YOUR KIDS

1592
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
REALLY READY?

1593
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
DO THEY KNOW WHERE THE BACK

1594
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
EXITS ARE?

1595
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
DO THEY KNOW HOW TO SHELTER IN

1596
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
PLACE?

1597
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
DO THEY KNOW WHERE TO GO TO

1598
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
HIDE.
I THINK OF THESE CHILDREN WHO

1599
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
WENT INTO THE CLOSETS WITH THEIR

1600
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
TEACHERS WHILE THE TEACHERS

1601
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
TRIED TO KEEP THEM CALM.

1602
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
IMAGINE THE GUNFIRE AND THESE

1603
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
CHILDREN JUST COVERING THEIR

1604
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
EARS WITH THEIR HANDS NOT EVEN

1605
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
KNOWING WHAT TO DO.

1606
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
DON, WE HEARD THAT STORY OF THAT

1607
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
TEACHER WHO BASICALLY AFTER THE

1608
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
SHOOTING STOPPED AND HEARD A

1609
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
KNOCK ON THE DOOR SAYING IT'S

1610
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
THE POLICE OPEN UP, SHE SAID NO,

1611
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
NO, NO, SHOW ME IDENTIFICATION

1612
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
AND THAT'S WHEN SHE OPEN THE

1613
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
DOOR.

1614
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
SOMETHING THAT SIMPLE SKROP

1615
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
POTENTIALLY SAVED THEIR LIFE HAD

1616
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
IT BEEN SOMEONE ELSE, DON.

1617
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
>> MY GOSH.

1618
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
IT'S SUCH A HORRIFIC TRAGEDY.

1619
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
THANK YOU, DEB FEYERICK.

1620
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000

AT LEAST ANOTHER DAY OR TWO

1623

TRYING TO PEAS TOGETHER THIS

1624
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
HORRIFIC PUZZLE.

1625
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
TO GIVE US A BETTER

1626
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED

1627
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
JOSH LEVS IS HERE WITH A VIRTUAL

1628
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
LOOK AT THE SCHOOL.

1629
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
>> I WANT TO SHOW EVERYONE THIS

1630
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
AERIAL VIEW OF THE SCHOOL.

1631
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
THERE ARE A FEW DETAILS THAT ARE

1632
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR THIS

1633
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
INVESTIGATION.

1634
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
YOU ALL WILL UNDERSTAND IT BEST

1635
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE

1636
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
SCHOOL.
I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE

1637
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
THIS IS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

1638
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1639
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
THE IDEA THAT THIS IS NOW A

1640
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
CRIME SCENE IS SO HORRIFIC.

1641
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
THE FIRST THING TO NOTE, THE

1642
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
OFFICIALS, THE POLICE ARE SAYING

1643
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
THEY ARE SCOURING THE ENTIRE

1644
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
SCHOOL EVERY ROOM, PRE BIT OF

1645
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
IT.
IN THE PARKING LOT, THIS IS

1646
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
THEIR WORDS THEY SAY EACH AND

1647
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
EVERY CAR IN THE ENTIRE LOT IS

1648
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
BEING INVESTIGATED.

1649
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S

1650
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
SOMETHING SPECIFIC THEY'RE

1651
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
LOOKING FOR.

1652
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
WE DO KNOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT

1653
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
EVERYTHING IN THIS ENTIRE AREA.

1654
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL HAS

1655
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
TOLD CNN THE GUNMANEN HAD SOME

1656
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
KIND OF ALTERCATION WITH

1657
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
OFFICIALS A FEW DAYS BEFORE OF

1658
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
THIS.
ANOTHER THING HAS COME IN TODAY

1659
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

1660
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE

1661
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
TIMELINE CLOSELY BECAUSE IN AN

1662
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
INCIDENT LIKE THIS EEB A

1663
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
FRACTION OF A MINUTE MAKES A BIG

1664
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
DIFFERENCE.
POLICE PUT OUT A STATEMENT

1665
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
SAYING THE INITIAL 911 CALL CAME

1666
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
AT 9:30 A.M.

1667
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY

1668
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT.

1669
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
THEY SAID IT WAS ABOUT 9:30 A.M.

1670
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, THAT'S THE

1671
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
TIME THAT THE SCHOOL SECURITY

1672
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
SYSTEM GETS PLACED ON AND DOORS

1673
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
ARE SHUT.
SO WAS SOMETHING ALREADY

1674
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
HAPPENING BY 9:30?

1675
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
WAS THE GUNMAN STILL OUTSIDE AT

1676
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
9:30?
THE OFFICIALS ARE SAYING HE

1677
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
FORCED HIS WAY IN.

1678
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
IF THE SYSTEM WAS ON, HOW DID HE

1679
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
FORCE HIS WAY IN?

1680
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
WHO IS DOES A PERSON FORCE HIS

1681
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
WAY IN WITH GUNS WHEN A SCHOOL

1682
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
HAS A SECURITY SYSTEM AND THEN

1683
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
THEY'VE SAID THAT THERE WERE

1684
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
WINDOWS THAT WERE SHATTERED BUT

1685
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
NOT TO READ INTO THAT BECAUSE

1686
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
WHEN THE AUTHORITIES WERE CALLED

1687
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
TO THE SCENE, THEY HAD TO BURST

1688
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
THEIR WAY IN.

1689
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
SO WHEN WE SEE SHATTERED

1690
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
WINDOWS, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE

1691
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
GUNMAN MIGHT HAVE GONE IN THAT

1692
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
WAY.

1693
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
THIS RAISES A GREAT NUMBER OF

1694
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
QUESTIONS.
WE BELIEVE THE KILLINGS WERE IN

1695
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
ONE AREA OF THE SCHOOL.

1696
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
CLEARLY AUTHORITIES BELIEVE

1697
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF FINDING

1698
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
EVIDENCE ANYWHERE WITHIN IT.

1699
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
WE'RE STAYING ON TOP OF ALL

1700
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000

WE -- WE FELT SOMETHING UNUSUAL

1757
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T RESPOND ON

1758
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
THE PHONE CALLS OR MESSAGES.

1759
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

1778
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE WORDS

1779
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
ARE.

WORDS.
I THINK IT'S COMING TO THESE

1781
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
MEMORIALS.

1782
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000

1783
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
ONE FAMILY TO ANOTHER.

1784
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000

JUST HUGS.

1787
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY

1788
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
WORDS.

1789
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000

ABOUT EACH OTHER.

1797
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
IT IS GOING TO TAKE AN

1798
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF CARING TO

A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL IS

ALTERCATION WITH SOME OF THE

01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
ALTERCATION, JOE?

INVESTIGATORS THOUGH HAVE BEEN

1823
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
TOLD THAT ADAM LANZA HAD SOME

1824
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000

1825
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000

01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
NOT CLEAR RIGHT NOW WHAT THAT

1828
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
MAY HAVE BEEN ABOUT.

1829
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
WE'VE BEEN REACHING OUT TO

1830
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
AUTHORITIES TO TRY TO EXPAND ON

1831
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000

01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
GOTTEN NO MORE DETAILS.

1833
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
THE REPORTING ON THIS HAS BEEN

1834
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT THIS

01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
SOURCE IS TELLING ME ON THE

1836
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
GROUND THAT THEY DON'T THINK THE

01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
STORY OF THAT ALTERCATION IS BAD

1838
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000

SO LOOKING TO LEARN MORE HOW

1839
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000

1840
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
INVOLVED AND OBVIOUSLY, THE

1841
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000

1845
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
OF EVIDENCE AND AT SOME POINT

1846
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SORT OF

1847
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
PEEL BACK AS THEY DESCRIBED IT,

1848
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
THE PIECES OF THE ONION AND BE

1849
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
ABLE TO EXPLAIN HOPEFULLY HOW

1850
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
AND WHY ALL OF THIS HAPPENED.

1851
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000

1860
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000

1911
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000

IN THAT TIME SHE HAD OVERHAULED

1924
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000

THOSE WHO REMEMBERED HER SAID

1930
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
SHE CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT IN

1931
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
HER SCHOOL THAT MADE PEOPLE FEEL

1932
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
ACCEPTED AND IMPORTANT AND THEY

1933
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
TRULY LOVED HER.

01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
THAT IN HIS WORDS, GOOD EVIDENCE

1995
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
IS BEING RECOVERED.

1996
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
BUT HE DID NOT GO INTO DETAIL.

1997
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
IN TERMS OF THE WEAPONS USED, WE

1998
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
DO KNOW THAT THREE WEAPONS WHERE

1999
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
IS RECOVERED AT THE SCENE OF THE

2000
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
SHOOTING NEAR THE SUSPECT'S

2001
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
BODY.
THERE WERE TWO HANDGUNS AND A

2002
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE.

2003
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
CNN HAS BEEN REPORTING THAT

2004
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
THOSE GUNS WERE PURCHASED BY HIS

2005
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
MOTHER, NANCY LANZA.

2006
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
THERE'S NOT MUCH WE DO KNOW

2007
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
ABOUT NANCY LANZA.

2008
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
WE SPOKE TO A NEIGHBOR EARLIER

2009
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
IN THE DAY.
AND SHE SAID THAT SHE WILL KNEW

2010
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
HER, BUT THERE WAS NOTHING OUT

2011
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
OF THE ORDINARY THAT SHE COULD

2012
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
SEE.

2013
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
>> SHE WAS LIKE A NORMAL ANYBODY

2014
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
ELSE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

2015
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
YOU KNOW, DECORATE THE HOUSE AND

2016
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
THE HOUSE WAS ALWAYS, YOU KNOW,

2017
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
PRISTINE AND I MEAN, SHE WAS

2018
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER HOUSEWIFE.

2019
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
>> AS FOR ADAM LANZA, FORMER

2020
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
CLASSMATES DESCRIBE HIM AS BEING

2021
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
SMART, STUDENT, SOMEONE WHO WAS

2022
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
QUIET, KEPT TO HIMSELF.

2023
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
A NEIGHBOR HOB KNEW HIM IN

2024
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
RECENT YEARS DESCRIBED HIM AS

2025
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
TROUBLED.
MARY SNOW, CNN, NEWTOWN,

2026
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
CONNECTICUT.

2027
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
>> AND AS WE TRY TO LEARN MORE

2028
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
ABOUT THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER,

2029
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
WE'RE ALSO LEARNING MORE ABOUT

2030
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
SOME OF THE WEAPONS THAT ADAM

2031
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
LANZA ALLEGEDLY USED TO TARGET

2032
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
KINDERGARTENERNERS AND FIRST

2033
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
GRADERS AT THE SCHOOL.

2034
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
AUTHORITIES FOUND THREE OF THE

2035
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
SIX GUNS NEAR LANZA'S BODY

2036
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
INSIDE THE SCHOOL CLASSROOM.

2037
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
THAT'S THE LATEST WE HAVE BEEN

2038
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
LEARNING ABOUT THAT.

2039
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
ALL THREE GUNS WERE OWNED AND

2040
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
REGISTERED BY HIS MOTHER.

2041
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
INVESTIGATORS RECOVERED THREE

2042
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
OTHER RIFLES.

2043
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THOSE

2044
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
WEAPONS WERE FOUND.

2045
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
WE WANT TO GET THEFT AFTERNOON

2046
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,000
TO MIKE BOUCHARD.

2047
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
YOU SUPERVISED THE ATF'S

2048
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
RESPONSE TO A TRAGIC KILLING

2049
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
SPREE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO, THE

2050
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
BELTWAY SNIPER.

2051
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
SO UNFORTUNATELY, YOU HAVE A LOT

2052
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
OF EXPERIENCE IN THESE KINDS OF

2053
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
HORRIFIC TRAGEDIES.

2054
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I WANT TO TALK SPECIFICALLY

2055
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
ABOUT THE WEAPONS.

2056
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
ORIGINALLY WE HAD HEARD THAT THE

2057
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
BUSHMASTER 223, THE

2058
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE HAD BEEN

2059
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
LEFT IN THE CAR.

2060
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
AND NOW WE NOW UNDERSTAND THAT

2061
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
IT ACTUALLY WAS INSIDE THE

2062
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
SCHOOL.
DOES THAT ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS

2063
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
FOR YOU ABOUT THE LARGE NUMBER

2064
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
OF SHOTS THAT PEOPLE REPORTED

2065
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
HEARING AND THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE

2066
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

2067
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
WERE KILLED IN THIS SPREE?

2068
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
>> WELL, SOLEDAD, I THINK IT

2069
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
LEAVES MORE QUESTIONS THAT NEED

2070
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
TO BE ANSWERED.

2071
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
OBVIOUSLY, HE PROBABLY CARRIED

2072
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
THE PISTOLS BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE

2073
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
EASILY CONCEALED.

2074
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
THAT MADE IT EASIER FOR HIM TO

2075
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
APPROACH THE SCHOOL.

2076
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
IF HE WAS WALKING UP TO THE
SCHOOL WITH A RIVAL, THEY COULD

2077
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
HAVE OBVIOUSLY LOCKED DOWN,

2078
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
CALLED THE POLICE.

2079
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
HE MAY HAVE LEFT THAT THE RIFLE

2080
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
IN THE VEHICLE AS A BACKUP.

2081
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
>> SO THERE ARE OTHER RIFLES,

2082
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
THREE OTHERS, AND IT'S REALLY

2083
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE HEARD

2084
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
ABOUT THESE OTHER THREE.

2085
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
ONE IS CALLED A HENRY REPEATING

2086
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
RIFLE.
WHAT IS THAT?

2087
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
>> THE OTHER THREE RIFLES THAT

2088
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
WERE DESCRIBED EARLIER ARE

2089
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
MAINLY HUNTING TYPE RIFLES.

2090
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
THEY'RE NOT TYPICALLY CALLED AN

2091
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
ASSAULT TYPE RIFLE.

2092
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
MUCH LIKE THE BUSHMASTER IS.

2093
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
>> SO WE HAVE BEEN TOLD AND IT'S

2094
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION, BUT

2095
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
THERE IS SOME INDICATIONING THAT

2096
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER MIGHT

2097
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
EARLIER IN THE WEEK ON TUESDAY

2098
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
HAVE GONE TO PURCHASE A GUN AT A

2099
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
LOCAL STORE.

2100
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT HAPPENED.

2101
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
IF HE -- IF THERE WAS A WAITING

2102
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
PERIOD AS WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

2103
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
HERE IN CONNECTICUT OR WHAT

2104
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
EXACTLY STOPPED HIM.

2105
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
HE'S 20 YEARS OLD.

2106
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
NO CRIMINAL RECORD.

2107
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
WOULD HE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO JUST

2108
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
GOEN AN PURCHASE A GUN IN THIS

2109
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
STATE?
>> AT 20 YEARS OLD, HE COULD

2110
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
PURCHASE A LONG GUN.

2111
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO BE 21 TO

2112
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
PURCHASE A HANDGUN FROM A GUN

2113
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
DEALER.
HOWEVER, COULD YOU PURCHASE ONE

2114
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
ON THE STREET.
OBVIOUSLY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS.

2115
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
BUT IN ORDER TO GO INTO A GUN

2116
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
STORE LICENSED DEALER, YOU

2117
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
COULD -- YOU HAVE TO BE 1 YEARS

2118
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
OLD TO BUY A LONG GUN, WHICH

2119
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
MOST SPORTING GOODS STORES ONLY

2120
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
SELL HUNTING TYPE RIFLES.

2121
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
>> SO WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE

2122
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
CONTINUED TO SEAL OFF THE

2123
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
SCHOOL, AND EARLIER IN A PRESS

2124
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
CONFERENCE, WE HEARD FROM THE

2125
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
STATE POLICE THAT IT'S AN ACTIVE

2126
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
CRIME SCENE AND THAT THEY'RE

2127
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:10,000
GOING TO GO INTO EVERY CREVICE

2128
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
AND CORNER.

2129
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
WHAT ARE THEY SEARCHING FOR AT

2130
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
THIS POINT?
>> OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GOING TO

2131
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
LOOK TO RECOVER ALL THE FIRED

2132
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
BULLETS.
WHETHER THEY -- IF THEY MISS,

2133
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
WENT INTO WALLS AND CEILING

2134
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
CANS, ET CETERA, THEY'LL RECOVER

2135
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
SO THEY CAN GET A GOOD ESTIMATE

2136
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
AS TO HOW MANY SHOTS WERE FIRED.

2137
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
IF THEY FIND ANY DIFFERENT TYPE

2138
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
OF CALIBER, OBVIOUSLY, THEY'D

2139
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
LIKE TO KNOW THAT.

2140
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
THEY HAVE TO VERIFY THAT THIS

2141
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
WAS THE ONLY SHOOTER WHICH I

2142
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
THINK THEY'VE ALREADY DONE AND

2143
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
THAT ALL THE WEAPONS THAT WERE

2144
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
USED HAVE BEEN RECOVERED.
SO THEY'LL BE DOING THIS CRIME

2145
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
SCENE AS WELL AS GOING -- THE

2146
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
SHOOTER COULD HAVE COME INTO THE

2147
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
SCHOOL DAYS BEFORE, COULD HAVE

2148
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
SECRETE THINGS MUCH LIKE THEY

2149
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
DID IN COLUMBINE WHERE THEY

2150
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
COULD HAVE PUT OTHER DEVICES.

2151
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE BY THE

2152
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
TIME THEY LEAVE THIS SCHOOL,

2153
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

2154
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
IN THIS CRIME SCENE HAS BEEN

2155
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
COMPLETED AND THEY CAN TURN IT

2156
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
BACK OVER TO THE SCHOOL

2157
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
OFFICIALS.
>> AND AS WE START THE BY SAYING

2158
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS AND

2159
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
MAYBE THERE WILL NEVER BE ALL

2160
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
THE ANSWERS THAT WE NEED TO KNOW

2161
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
IN THIS CASE.

2162
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXPERTISE ON

2163
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
THE WEAPONRY.
I APPRECIATE IT.

2164
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
A LITTLE BIT EARLIER, WOLF

2165
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
BLITZER SPOKE WITH OUR CHIEF

2166
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT SANJAY

2167
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
GUPTA.

2168
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

2169
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
SUPPORT THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR

2170
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ACHED BY THE

2171
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
TRAGEDY.

2172
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000

01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
PEOPLE WERE USING THE CENTER,

2178
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
AND I CAN TELL YOU AT THIS

2179
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JUST ABOUT A

IS SET UP BY DANBURY HOSPITAL,

2182
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
THE SAME HOSPITAL THAT TOOK CARE

2183
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
OF A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WOUNDED

2184
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
INITIALLY IN THE SHOOTING

2185
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
YESTERDAY.

2186
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
SAME HOSPITAL SETTING UP THIS

2187
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
CRISIS CENTER.

2188
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
THERE WERE PROBABLY ABOUT 100

2189
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
CARS IN THE PARKING LOT.

2190
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
OBVIOUSLY THE RESPECT FOR

2191
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
PRIVACY, WE DIDN'T FILM THEM.

2192
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
BUT FAMILIES COMING IN, SMALL

2193
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000

DADS AND ENTIRE FAMILIES, AS

2195
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
WELL.
THEY WERE ALSO STAYING FOR A

2196
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
LONG TIME.

2197
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
THIS WASN'T ONE OF THOSE THINGS

2198
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
WHERE PEOPLE WERE COMING IN AND

2199
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
OUT CONSTANTLY.

2200
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
THE WHOLE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I

2201
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
GUESS SORT OF DEDICATED TO THIS

2202
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
TODAY FOR 12 HOURS.

01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
AS YOU KNOW, WOLF, YALE NEW

2204
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
HANCH WHICH HAS A NATIONALLY

2205
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
RENOWNED-CRISIS CENTER.

01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
>> YALE UNIVERSITY.

2207
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
CRISIS COUNSELING ALL OVER THE

2208
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
COUNTRY.
OBVIOUSLY, THEY'RE NOT TOO FAR

2209
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
FROM HERE BUT THEY ALSO HAVE A

2210
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
PHONE LINE SET UP AND PEOPLE

2211
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
HAVE BEEN CALLING IN CONSTANTLY

2212
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
FROM THIS AREA BUT FROM ALL OVER

2213
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
THE PLACE.

2214
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT

2215
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
WE'RE HEARING PEOPLE ALL OVER

2216
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED

2217
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
BY AND USING SOME OF THESE

2218
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
RESOURCES.
>> SO THEY'RE BRINGING A

2219
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
PSYCHIATRIST, PSYCHOLOGISTS BUT

2220
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AS

2221
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
WELL?

2222
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AND PARTICULARLY CHILD

2223
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
COUNSELORS.
YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE WHO

2224
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
SPECIALIZENY DEALING WITH

2225
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
CHILDREN.

2226
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
THEY HAVE PSYCHOLOGISTS AND

2227
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
PSYCHIATRISTS AND THE

2228
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
PSYCHIATRISTS CAN OBVIOUSLY

2229
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
BEING PEOPLE MEDICAL DOCTORS.

2230
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
THEY CAN PRESCRIBE MEDICATIONS.

2231
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF PRESCRIPTIONS

2232
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
ARE BEING GIMP.

2233
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
BUT A LOT OF COUNSELING CLEARLY

2234
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
GOING ON.
PEOPLE ARE CLEARLY USING THESE

2235
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
RESOURCES.
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK

2236
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
OBVIOUSLY IN THE PARKING LOT

2237
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
ABOUT IT, BUT GHG QUITE

2238
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
PRIVATELY.
YOU CAN TELL THERE'S A HUGE

2239
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
DEMAND.
>> IF YOU'RE A MOM OR A DAD AND

2240
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
YOU'VE SEEN WHAT'S GOING ON,

2241
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
FORTUNATELY LET'S SAY YOUR KIDS

2242
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
ARE OKAY, BUT YOU'RE STILL IN A

2243
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
STATE OF SHOCK, WHAT KIND OF

2244
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
MEDICAL TREATMENT?

2245
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME DRUGS

2246
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
THAT YOU CAN GIVE BUT WHAT DO

2247
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
YOU DO?

2248
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
>> YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS

2249
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
THAT I THINK AND YOU AND I BOTH

2250
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
COVERED A LOT OF THESE.

2251
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
FOR PARENTS ESPECIALLY REALLY

2252
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
ALMOST CHECKING THEIR OWN

2253
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
FEELINGS FIRST, MAKING SURE THEY

2254
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
HAVE THEIR OWN FEELINGS IN

2255
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
CONTROL.
IT'S BEEN HARD FOR ME FOR YOU

2256
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I'M SURE AS WELL BEFORE TALKING

2257
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
TO YOUR KIDS TO MAKE SURE YOU

2258
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
HAVE SOME CONTROL OF YOUR

2259
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
FEELINGS AND THEN BEING AS

2260
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE ABOUT

2261
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
THIS.
ONE OF THE TECHNIQUES THAT SEEMS

2262
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND I KEEP

2263
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
HEARING THIS FROM EXPERTS IN THE

2264
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
FIELD IS LET THE CHILD IN THIS

2265
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
CASE DO THE TALKING FIRST.

2266
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
GET AN IDEA OF HOW MUCH THEY

2267
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
KNOW AND THEN SLOWLY FILL IN

2268
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
DETAILS BUT NOT TOO GRAPHIC

2269
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
DETAILS OBVIOUSLY.
AGAIN THIS WHOLE SIMPLISTIC

2270
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
NOTION OF RE-ESTABLISHING A

2271
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
ROUTINE.

2272
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
IT SOUNDS ALMOST TOO SIMPLE IN A

2273
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS TOO SMALL.

2274
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
BUT IT CAN MAKE A BIG

2275
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
DIFFERENCE.

2276
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
IT'S AROUND THE HOLIDAYS.

2277
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
PEOPLE MAIL VIF HOLIDAY

2278
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
ACTIVITIES, SOCCER PRACTICE,

2279
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
THINGS LIKE THAT, GETTING BACK

2280
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
INTO THAT GROOVE.

2281
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
THEY FIND IF YOU CAN ESTABLISH

2282
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
THAT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER,

2283
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
YOU'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO

2284
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
REALLY MITIGATE SOME OF THESE

2285
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
SYMPTOMS.
IF I WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE

2286
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
DATA, FOR EXAMPLE, VIRGINIA

2287
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
TECH.
EVEN ABOUT THREE TO FOUR MONTHS

2288
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
AFTERWARD, ABOUT 15% OF PEOPLE

2289
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
STILL HAD SIGNIFICANT PTSD.

2290
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
IF PEOPLE ACTUALLY SAUL SOME OF

2291
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
THE VIOLENCE, IT WENT UP TO AS

2292
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
HIGH AS 77%.

2293
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
YOU TYPICALLY THINK OF IT AS

2294
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
SOMETHING YOU SEE IN ADULTS BUT

2295
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
YOU SEE IT IN CHILDREN, AS WELL.

2296
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
WE'RE GETTING MORE AND MORE

2297
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
EVIDENCE OF THAT ALL THE TIME.

2298
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
>> DR. SANJAY GUPTA AND WOLF

2299
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
BLITZER ARE TALKING WHAT PEOPLE

2300
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
CAN DO TO TRY TO GIVE SOME

2301
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
SOLACE TO THEIR CHILDREN IN THE

2302
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
WAKE OF SUCH A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

2303
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
GOING TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK.

2304
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL

2305
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
CONTINUE TO UPDATE YOU ON THE

2306
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
VERY LATEST ON THE ALLEGED

2307
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
SHOOTER IN THIS CASE.

2308
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IN TOWN AS

2309
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
PEOPLE COME TOGETHER TO TRY TO

2310
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
SHOW SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE

2311
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
LOST EVERYTHING HERE.

2312
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
AND ALSO, WE'LL UPDATE YOU ON

2313
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
THE INVESTIGATION AS WE CONTINUE

2314
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
TO GET INFORMATION FROM LAW

2315
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
ENFORCEMENT SOURCES.
THAT'S AHEAD.

2316
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
WE'RE BACK IN JUST A MOMENT.

2317
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
>> IT'S HORRIFIC.

2318
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
IT'S JUST YOU FEEL THE PAIN OF

2319
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
THESE PEOPLE.

2320
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
THE CHILDREN, THE YOUNG

2321
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
CHILDREN.

2322
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I LOST MY CHILD, AND IT LEAVES A

2323
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
SCAR.
IT DOESN'T GO AWAY.

2324
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
IT'S A HORRIBLE THING BECAUSE

2325
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
YOU FEEL HELPLESS.

2326
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANT TO DO

2327
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
SOMETHING, BUT WHAT DO YOU DO?

2328
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
YOU PRAY.

2329
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
OUR FAMILY GOT TOGETHER LAST

2330
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
TIME WE PRAYED.

2331
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
AND MY WIFE AND I, AND THE

2332
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
EDUCATORS AND THE ADMINISTRATORS

2333
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
THAT LOST THEIR LIVES AND THEY

2334
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
HAVE FAMILIES ALSO.

2335
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
YOU KNOW?
AND CHILDREN.

2336
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
AND SO IT'S IMPACTED THE TOWN,

2337
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
IT'S

2338
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
IT'S IMPACTED THE STATE, THE

2339
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
WORLD, THE U.S.
IT'S A HORRIBLE THING.

2340
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
SantHo, Ho, Ho!anta!

2341
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Santa!

2342
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Want to see some magic?

2343
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Watch this! Merry Chr...

2345
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I landed on my keys.

2346
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Did you get that?

2347
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Oh yeah.

2348
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
That was amazing.

2349
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Here you go.

2350
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
That was a fun trick!

2351
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
See? Santa's okay.

2352
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Walk it off Santa.

2421
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000

2422
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I ASKED THE PARENTS, DIANE AND

2423
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000

ALWAYS TRANSPIRED.

01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I THINK WE HAVE THAT SOUND BITE.

2427
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
>> HE'S REASSURING HIMSELF THAT

2428
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,000
SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

2429
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
HE REALLY, REALLY REALLY CARED

2430
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
ABOUT HIS TEACHER.

2431
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
HE WAS VERY CLOSE WITH HER AND

2432
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
SHE REALLY LOVED THAT CLASS, AND

2433
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
HE KEEPS SAYING I REALLY HOPE

2434
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
SHE'S OKAY.

2435
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I HOPE IT'S NOT HER.

2436
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
HE KNOWS THAT SHE'S BEEN HURT,

2437
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
BUT HE DOESN'T NOTE END RESULT.

2438
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
HE KNOWS THE KIDS THAT HE SAW

2439
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
GETTING SHOT.

2440
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE OUTCOME.

2441
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
SO I THINK HE'S REASSURING

2442
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
HIMSELF IN HIS OF-YEAR-OLD MIND.

2443
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I KNOW HE'S PROCESSING IT, BUT I

2444
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
THINK HE'S REASSURING HIMSELF

2445
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,000
AND TELLING HIMSELF THAT IT'S
GOING TO BE OKAY.

2446
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000

2447
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000

2459
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU

2460

2461

THIS NEVER HAPPENS IN YOUR TOWN.

2462
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000

IS SOMETHING THAT THIS TOWN WILL

2468
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
NEVER BE THE SAME AFTER.

2469
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000

2470

2471
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000

THEIR TWO CHILDREN.

2483
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
SHE SAID WAS INDESCRIBABLE.

2484
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
AT THE VERY SAME TIME, THEY

2485
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000

FAMILIES THAT CANNOT SHARE THAT

2487
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
KIND OF RELIEF TODAY.

2488
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
THIS IS WHY THEY WANTED TO SPEAK

2489
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
OUT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TRY TO

2490
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000

DETECTIVES.

2505
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
THEY SAID -- THEY WERE VERY

2506
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
PROUD OF THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL IN

2507
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
THIS 6-YEAR-OLD BOY COULD

2508
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
REMEMBER HOW THIS UNFOLDED.

2509
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
HE SAID HE SAW THE GUNMAN.

2510
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
HE SAW HIM SHOOT HIS TEACHER AND

2511
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
HE ALSO HAD MENTIONED THAT HE

2512
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
HAD SEEN OTHER KIDS GETTING

2513
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
SHOT.
HE HAD NOT GONE INTO DETAIL OF

2514
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
HOW, WHERE, WHEN OR YOU KNOW,

2515
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
HOW IT ALL UNFOLDED IN WHAT WAY.

2516
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO ME AND I'M

2517
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
SURE TO YOU WITH CHILDREN TO

2518
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
THINK AT THAT MOMENT THAT THESE

2519
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
CHILDREN HAVE THE PRESENCE OF

2520
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
MIND TO RUN AND FLEE RATHER THAN

2521
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,000
BE FROZEN IN FEAR AND MAKE IT TO

2522
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
SAFETY.
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE THERE WERE

2523
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
ANGELS IN THE ROOM THAT DAY.

2524
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO EXPLAIN

2525
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
IT.
>> AND SO MANY OTHERS DIDN'T

2526
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
MAKE IT OUT.

2527
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
THE TEACHERS HAVE REALLY EMERGED

2528
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
AS THE TRUE HEROES IN THE STORY.

2529
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,000
THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS WHO

2530
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
LITERALLY HAVE THROWN THEMSELVES
IN FRONT OF CHILDREN TO TRY TO

2531
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
PROTECT THEM FROM GUNFIRE IS

2532
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
STUNNING.

2533
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
>> VICKI SOTO IS A YOUNG WOMAN.

2534
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
SHE IS SOME 27 YEARS OLD.

2535
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
A YOUNG, YOUNG WOMAN AND TO

2536
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
THINK IN THAT MOMENT OF TERROR,

2537
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO TO PROTECT

2538
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
THESE CHILDREN, IT'S AMAZING.

2539
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
>> OUR HEARTS BREAK FOR ALL THE

2540
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
FAMILIES TODAY.

2541
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000

2545
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000

2546
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS

2547
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
CONTRADICTORY INCLUDING ABOUT

2548
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
THE WEAPONS USED TO KILL ALL

2549
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
THOSE PEOPLE YESTERDAY.

2550
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
POLICE SAY THE SUSPECT HAD

2551
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
ACCESS TO SIX GUNS.

2552
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE

2553
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL, THE

2554
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000

SORRY SUSAN FOR MANNING LING

2559
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000

OBVIOUSLY YOU AND I TALKING FOR

2561
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
MANY HOURS OVER THE LAST 24

2562
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
HOURS.
YOU WERE ONE OF THE FIRST

2563
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
REPORTERS ON THE SCENE

2564
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
YESTERDAY.

2565
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
I KNOW THE INFORMATION COMES OUT

2566
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME.

2567
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
LET'S START WITH THE GUNS.

2568
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
WHAT INFORMATION IS NEW ABOUT

2569
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
THE WEAPONS USED?

2570
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
>> WELL, BIG PICTUREWISE,

2571
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
REMEMBER AT THIS MORNING'S NEWS

2572
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
CONFERENCE, THE STATE POLICE

2573
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
SAID THAT A BETTER PICTURE WAS

2574
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
EMERGING FROM THEM ABOUT WHAT

2575
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
LED TO THIS.

2576
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
PART OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH

2577
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
GUNS.
SO THE NEW INFORMATION THAT

2578
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
WE'RE REPORTING NOW AS I JUST

2579
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
CAME BACK FROM DICK'S SPORTING

2580
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
GOODS HERE IN DANBURY,

2581
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
CONNECTICUT, NEARBY HERE, AND I

2582
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
WAS ABLE TO LEARN FROM LAW

2583
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
ENFORCEMENT SOURCES THAT IN THE

2584
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
DAYS BEFORE LITERALLY TUESDAY OF

2585
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
THIS WEEK, THAT THE SUSPECTED

2586
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
SHOOTER IN THIS CASE, ADAM

2587
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
LANZA, WENT TO THE STORE AND

2588
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
TRIED TO BUY A GUN.

2589
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
HE WASN'T SUCCESSFUL.

2590
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT KIND

2591
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
OF A GUN THAT HE WAS TRYING TO

2592
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
BUY, BUT OUR SOURCES SAY THAT

2593
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
FOR WHATEVER REASON, HE JUST

2594
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT AROUND AND

2595
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
WASN'T INTERESTED AND LEFT.

2596
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
HOWEVER, I'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT

2597
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
STORE EMPLOYEES ARE COOPERATING

2598
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
WITH INVESTIGATORS ABOUT WHAT

2599
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
HAPPENED, AND THAT THEY ARE

2600
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
CURRENTLY SEARCHING THEIR STORE

2601
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS FOR VIDEO

2602
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE
SUSPECTED SHOOTER WAS, IN FACT,

2603
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
IN THAT STORE ON TUESDAY TO TRY

2604
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
TO FIRM THAT UP.

2605
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
ALSO WE'VE LEARNED AND YOU'VE

2606
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
POINTED OUT THAT THE SUSPECTED

2607
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
SHOOTER IN THIS CASE HAD ACCESS

2608
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:44,000
TO AT LEAST SIX GUNS, MAY HAVE

2609
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
HAD ACCESS TO AS MANY AS SIX
GUNS.

2610
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
HE CERTAINLY HAD ACCESS 0 THREE
OF THEM, AND AUTHORITIES NOW

2611
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
TELL US, OUR SOURCES, THAT THE

2612
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
THREE GUNS THAT WE'VE BEEN

2613
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
TELLING YOU ABOUT SINCE

2614
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
YESTERDAY, THAT IS THE GLOCK,

2615
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
THE SIG SAUER AND THE BUSHMASTER

2616
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
THAT ORIGINALLY WAS THOUGHT TO

2617
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
BE IN THE MOTHER'S CAR OUTSIDE

2618
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
WERE ACTUALLY ALL THREE WERE

2619
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
FOUND WITH HIM IN THE CLASSROOM.

2620
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
AND ALSO AUTHORITIES SAY THEY DO

2621
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
KNOW WHICH OF THOSE THREE GUNS

2622
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
HE USED TO KILL HIMSELF BUT

2623
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
THEY'RE NOT REVEALING THAT AT

2624
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
THIS TIME.

2625
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
NOW, SPEAKING TO THE ISSUE OF

2626
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
ACCESS, WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN

2627
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
THAT VEHICLE OUTSIDE, IT IS

2628
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
STILL UNCLEAR WHETHER YET

2629
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
ANOTHER VEHICLE WHICH MIGHT MEAN

2630
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
A SEVENTH ONE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN

2631
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
THAT CAR.

2632
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
WE JUST DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO

2633
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
THAT YET.

2634
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
NOW, WE KNOW THAT THOSE THREE

2635
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
OTHER WEAPONS, SOLEDAD, THAT

2636
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
WE'VE REFERRED TO ARE THREE

2637
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
RIFLES THAT HE MAY HAVE HAD

2638
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
ACCESS TO.

2639
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
HOWEVER THEY'RE DESCRIBED TO US

2640
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
AS SORT OF LONG GUNS OR

2641
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
CERTAINLY OLDER MODELS THAT

2642
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN PART OF

2643
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
A GUN COLLECTION AND THEREFORE,

2644
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD INTEREST TO

2645
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
THE SHOOTER TO BE USED IN THIS

2646
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
CASE.

2647
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED FROM CNN'S

2648
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
DAVID ARIOSTO, HE SPOKE WITH A

2649
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
MAN WHO OWNS A LANDSCAPING

2650
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
BUSINESS AND SAID VERY RECENTLY

2651
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
THAT THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER SHOWED

2652
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
HIM A NEW GUN PURCHASE SHE HAD

2653
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
MADE AND SAID IT WAS PART OF A

2654
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
GUN COLLECTION AND SHE ALSO TOLD

2655
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
HIM THAT SHE WOULD OFTEN GO

2656
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
TARGET SHOOTING.

2657
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,000
>> TOWN OF NEWTOWN PAT LAGORA.

2658
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.

2659
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I HAVE COMMENTS ON THE BAFFLE OF

NEWTOWN HAS SUFFERED A

2664
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
HORRENDOUS TRAGEDY.

A HARM THAT HAS BROKEN OUR

WE'VE COMPLETED THE CHILDREN BY

2754
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
ABOUT 1:30.

2755
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000

2756
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
THE ASSAILANT AND HIS MOTHER

01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
WILL BE FINISHED TONIGHT.

2758
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
AND I'LL DO THOSE TOMORROW

2759
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:09,000
MORNING.

2760
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
LIEUTENANT VANCE AND STAFF HAVE

2761
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000

2762
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:20,000
DATES OF BIRTH.

2763
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
ANYTHING ELSE?

2764
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
NO, NO.

2765
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
AND THAT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED.

2766
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,000
HOPE YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH COPIES.

2767
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:37,000
EVERYBODY, DEATH WAS CAUSED

2768
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
BY -- EVERY ONE THAT WE'VE

2769
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
COMPLETED SO FAR WAS CAUSED BY

2770
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

2771
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,000
AND OBVIOUSLY, THE MANNER OF

2772
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
DEATH ON ALL OF THESE CASES HAS

2773
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,000
BEEN CLASSIFIED AS HOMICIDE.

2774
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
>> HOW MANY MEDICAL EXAMINERS

2775
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
WORKED WITH YOU TODAY, SIR?

2776
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:59,000
>> I HAVE FOUR DOCTORS AND MAN.

2777
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I THINK ALL TEN OF MY

2778
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
TECHNICIANS BOTH THE FULL-TIMERS

2779
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
AND PART-TIMERS WERE THERE.

2780
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
AND ONE STUDENT FROM QUINNIPIAC

2781
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
UNIVERSITY, THIS WAS HER FIRST

2782
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
DAY.

2783
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
THAT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING.

2784
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
AND THE MAJORITY OF OUR

2785
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
INVESTIGATIVE STAFF WERE WORKING

2786
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
ON THIS AT SOME POINT.

2787
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
WHETHER THEY WERE WITH US LAST

2788
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,000
NIGHT OR ON THE JOB TODAY.

2789
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,000
AND OUR -- I THINK A LOT OF OUR

2790
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
CHAIR CAL OR WHAT THEY CALL

2791
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
PROCESSING TECHS WHO DO THE

2792
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
PAPERWORK AND SO FORTH WERE

2793
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
THERE.
THEY'RE UP ALL ON THE SECOND

2794
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
FLOOR AND I DIDN'T GET THERE

2795
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
TODAY.
>> SIR, YOU OBVIOUSLY BY THE

2796
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
NATURE OF YOUR JOB, YOU DEAL

2797
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
WITH HORRIBLE THINGS AT TIMES.

2798
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
IS THIS ONE OVER THE TOP?

2799
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
IS THIS ONE A BIT DIFFERENT THAN

2800
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
ANYTHING YOU'VE DONE BEFORE,

2801
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
SIR?
>> DID EVERYBODY HEAR THE

2802
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
QUESTION?
>> NO.

2803
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
>> IT WAS GIVEN WHAT I DEAL WITH

2804
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
ALL THE TIME, IS THIS ONE OVER

2805
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
THE TOP.

2806
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR A THIRD OF

2807
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
A CENTURY.

2808
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
AND IT'S MY SENSIBILITIES MAY

2809
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
NOT BE THE AVERAGE MAN.

2810
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
BUT THIS PROBABLY IS THE WORST I

2811
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:22,000
HAVE SEEN OR THE WORST THAT I

2812
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
KNOW OF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES

2813
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
HAVING SEEN.

2814
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:29,000
AND THAT ALL THE MORE MAKES ME

2815
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:33,000
PROUD AND GRATEFUL TO OUR STAFF

2816
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,000
WHO TO A MAN HAVE JUST BEHAVED

2817
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:47,000
MOST PROFESSIONALLY AND STRONGLY

2818
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
AND I HOPE THEY AND I HOPE THE

2819
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
PEOPLE OF NEWTOWN DON'T HAVE IT

2820
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
CRASH ON THEIR HEAD LATER ABOUT

2821
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
YOU,.
>> Reporter: DOCTOR, ON THAT

2822
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
EXAMINATION, COULD YOU TELL

2823
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
WHICH CALIBER OF THE HANDGUN

2824
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
COMPARED TO THE RIFLE OF THESE

2825
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,000
SHOOTING VICTIMS WERE?

2826
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,000
>> IT'S A GOOD THING IT'S NOT A

2827
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
PROSECUTION BECAUSE THEN I

2828
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
COULDN'T ANSWER YOU THAT.

2829
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
ALL OF THE WOUNDS I KNOW OF AT

2830
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
THIS POINT WERE CAUSED BY THE

2831
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
LONG WEAPON.
>> SO THE RIFLE WAS THE THE

2832
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
PRIMARY WEAPON.

2833
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,000
>> YES.
>> WHAT CALIBER WERE THE --

2834
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
>> THE QUESTION WAS WHAT CALIBER

2835
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
WERE THESE BULLETS.

2836
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I KNOW, I PROBABLY KNOW MORE

2837
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
ABOUT FIREARMS THAN MOST

2838
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
PATHOLOGISTS BUT IF I SAY IT IN

2839
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
COURT THEY YELL AT ME AND DON'T

2840
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
MAKE ME ANSWER.

2841
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
SO I'LL LET THE POLICE DEAL WITH

2842
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
THAT FOR YOU.

2843
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
>> DOCTOR, CAN YOU TELL ABOUT

2844
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
THE NATURE OF THE WOUNDS?

2845
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
WERE THEY AT VERY CLOSE RANGE?

2846
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
WERE THE CHILDREN SHOT FROM

2847
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
ACROSS THE ROOM?

2848
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
>> I ONLY DID SEVEN OF THE

2849
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
AUTOPSIES.

2850
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
THE VICTIMS I HAD RANGED FROM 3

2851
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
TO 11 WOUNDS APIECE.

2852
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
I ONLY SAW TWO OF THEM WITH

2853
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
CLOSE RANGE SHOOTING.

2854
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
BUT THAT'S A SAMPLE.

2855
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
I REALLY DON'T HAVE OF DETAILED

2856
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,000
INFORMATION ON THE REST OF THE

2857
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
INJURIES.
>> BUT YOU SAID IT WAS THE LONG

2858
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
RIFLE THAT WAS USED?

2859
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
>> YES.

2860
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,000
>> I THOUGHT THE LONG RIFLE WAS

2861
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
DISCOVERED IN THE CAR.

2862
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
THAT'S NOT CORRECT?
>> THAT'S NOT CORRECT, SIR.

2863
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:21,000
>> HOW MANY BULLETS CASINGS DID

2864
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
YOU FIND TOTAL?

2865
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
>> OH.

2866
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
I'M LUCKY I CAN TELL YOU HOW

2867
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:31,000
MANY I FOUND.

2868
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I DON'T KNOW.
THERE WERE LOTS OF THEM, OKAY?

2869
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:38,000
THIS TYPE OF WEAPON IS NOT --

2870
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
THE BULLETS ARE DESIGNED IN SUCH

2871
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
A FASHION THAT THE ENERGY --

2872
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
THIS IS VERY CLINICAL.

2873
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
I SHOULDN'T BE SAYING THIS, BUT

2874
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
THE ENERGY IS DEPOSITED IN THE

2875
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
TISSUE AND SO THE BULLET STAYS

2876
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
IN.
>> DOCTOR, DID THE CHILDREN DIE

2877
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
QUICKLY?

2878
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
>> THAT'S ALWAYS A DIFFICULT

2879
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
QUESTION AND OBVIOUSLY I DON'T

2880
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
HA

2881
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
HAVE -- I DON'T HAVE DETAILED

2882
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,000
INFORMATION ON ALL OF THEM, BUT

2883
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
THIS IS A VERY DEVASTATING SET

2884
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
OF INJURIES.

2885
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
>> DID THEY SUFFER?

2886
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
>> I DON'T -- I DON'T -- THE

2887
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
BEST OF MY ABILITY TO ANSWER

2888
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
THAT QUESTION WHICH IS ALWAYS

2889
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
LESS THAN PERFECT, IF SO, NOT

2890
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
FOR VERY LONG.

2891
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
>> WERE MOST OF THE INJURIES

2892
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
MULTIPLE?
>> ALL THE ONES -- I BELIEVE SO,

2893
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:35,000
YES.

2894
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,000
>> WHAT SHAPE ARE THE BODIES --

2895
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
>> WE DID NOT BRING THE BODIES

2896
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
AND THE FAMILIES INTO CONTACT.

2897
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
WE TOOK PICTURES OF THEM.

2898
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,000
OF THEIR FAISAL FEATURES.

2899
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
YOU HAVE -- IT'S EASIER ON THE

2900
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
FAMILIES WHEN YOU DO THAT.

2901
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
THERE IS A TIME AND A PLACE FOR

2902
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL IN THE

2903
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
GRIEVING PROCESS.

2904
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
BUT TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE FELT

2905
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
IT WOULD BE BEST TO DO IT THIS

2906
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,000
WAY AND YOU CAN SORT OF -- YOU

2907
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
CAN CONTROL THE SITUATION

2908
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
DEPENDING ON YOUR PHOTOGRAPHER.

2909
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,000
I HAVE VERY GOOD PHOTOGRAPHERS.

2910
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
ABOUT YOU.
>> DO YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE IN

2911
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
THE TIME OF DEATH BETWEEN THE

2912
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
BODY THAT WAS RECOVERED FROM THE

2913
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
HOUSE AND THE BODIES THAT WERE

2914
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
RECOVERED FROM THE SCHOOL?
>> NO, I DON'T.

2915
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
>> HOW YOUNG.

2916
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
>> SORRY, I DON'T.

2917
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
>> HOW YOUNG WAS THE YOUNGEST

2918
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
VICTIM, DOCTOR, HOW OLD WAS THE

2919
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,000
OLDEST VICTIM.
>> YOU ALL HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

2920
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
SPREAD SHEET WHEN WE PASS IT

2921
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
OUT.
>> THAT YOU DEALT WITH.

2922
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
>> ALL THE ONES I DEALT WITH --

2923
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
EVERYBODY I DEALT WITH, I

2924
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
BELIEVE THEY'RE ALL FIRST

2925
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
GRADERS.
>> DID THE GUNMAN KILL HIMSELF

2926
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
WITH THE RIFLE?
>> NO, I DON'T KNOW YET.

2927
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I'LL EXAMINE HIM TOMORROW

2928
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
MORNING.

2929
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
BUT I DON'T THINK SO.

2930
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE WOMAN IN THE

2931
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,000
HOME?
>> HAVE I NOT SEEN HER YET.

2932
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
>> THE CHILDREN ALL IN ONE

2933
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,000
LOCATION, ONE CLASSROOM OR --

2934
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
>> OKAY.

2935
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
PAUL AND COMPANY WILL DEAL WITH

2936
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
THAT.
PAUL AND COMPANY.

2937
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
LIEUTENANT VANCE IS GOING TO

2938
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
HANDLE THAT ONE.

2939
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
>>.

2940
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
>> Reporter: [ INAUDIBLE

2941
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
QUESTION ].

2942
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
>> WE DISCUSSED THIS BRIEFLY

2943
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:26,000
WITH THE STAFF BEFORE I CAME
HERE.

2944
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
THERE WAS OF -- I BELIEVE

2945
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
EVERYBODY WAS HIT MORE THAN

2946
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
ONCE.

2947
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
>> WAS THERE ANY EVIDENCE OF A

2948
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
STRUGGLE, ANY BRUISES OR --

2949
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
>> THE NATURE OF THE SHOOTING

2950
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
WAS THERE ANY SENSE THAT IT WAS

2951
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000
A LOT OF CARE TAKEN TO PRECISION

2952
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
FROM THE SHOOTER OR WAS IT

2953
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
SPREAD RANDOMLY?

2954
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
>> BOTH.

2955
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION TO

2956
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
ANSWER.
>> GIVEN THE WOUNDS?

2957
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,000
>> YEAH.

2958
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
IT'S REALLY -- YOU WOULD THINK

2959
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
AFTER THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

2960
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
I'VE SEEN SHOT I COULD ANSWER

2961
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
THAT QUESTION, BUT IT'S -- IF I

2962
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
ATTEMPTED TO ANSWER IT IN COURT,

2963
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
THERE WOULD BE AN ACTION AND

2964
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
THEY WOULD WIN.

2965
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:16,000
>> DOCTOR, CAN YOU DESCRIBE,

2966
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
WHAT THE KIDS LOOKED LIKE WHEN

2967
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,000
THEY CAME TO YOU, WHAT WERE THEY

2968
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
WEARING?
>> THEY WERE WEARING CUTE KIDS'

2969
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
STUFF.
THEY'RE FIRST GRADERS WEARING

2970
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
CUTE KIDS STUFF.

2971
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
YOU KNOW?
IT'S THE KIND OF STUFF YOU'D

2972
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
ACCEPTED YOUR KIDS OR YOUR

2973
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:35,000
GRANDKIDS OUT THE DOOR ON TO
FIRST GRADE IN.

2974
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
>> DOCTOR, CAN WE DISCUSS THE

2975
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
FATAL INJURIES TO THE ADULTS?

2976
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,000
>> SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE
CHILDREN.

2977
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
>> DOCTOR, THE CHILDREN THAT YOU

2978
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
AUTOPSIED, WHERE ON THE BODIES

2979
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
WERE THOSE WOUNDS?

2980
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
>> ALL OVER.

2981
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:55,000
ALL OVER.

2982
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE MOTHER?

2983
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
>> I HAVE NOT EXAMINED HER YET.

2984
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
THAT WILL BE TOMORROW MORNING.

2985
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
>> WERE THEY AT DECKS OR RUNNING

2986
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
AWAY?

2987
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
>> I'LL LET THE SCENE GUYS

2988
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE.

2989
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
OKAY?

2990
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
OBVIOUSLY, I WAS AT THE SCENE.

2991
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
OBVIOUSLY I'M VERY EXPERIENCED

2992
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
IN THAT, BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE

2993
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
WHO ARE THE NUMBER ONE

2994
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
PROFESSIONALS ON THAT.
I'LL LET THEM HANDLE IT.

2995
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
>> DOCTOR, YOU SAID THAT THE

2996
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
BODIES THAT YOU EXAMINED, THE

2997
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
SEVEN HAD THREE TO 11 SHOTS.

2998
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
>> THAT'S JUST THE ONES THAT I

2999
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
DID.
>> JUST THE ONES THAT YOU

3000
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,000
EXAMINED.
SO THIS MAN WAS SHOOTING --

3001
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,000
>> I THINK THE, YEAH, I THINK

3002
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
THE GUY WHO'S DID THE CRIME

3003
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
SCENE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU

3004
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
SOMETHING ABOUT HOW MANY CART

3005
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
RIDGES WERE FOUND.

3006
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,000
>> IS THIS PROTOCOL ON HOW YOU

3007
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
DID THE AUNZS?

3008
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,000
LIKE THE MOTHER AND THE.

3009
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
>> OUR GOAL -- OUR GOAL WAS TO

3010
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
GET THE KIDS OUT AND AVAILABLE

3011
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:00,000
TO THE FUNERAL DIRECTORS FIRST.

3012
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
JUST FOR -- WELL, OBVIOUS
REASONS.

3013
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,000
>> HOW MANY BOYS, HOW MANY

3014
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
GIRLS?
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

3015
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
>> DOCTOR.

3016
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.
>> YOU SAID BEFORE WHEN I ASKED

3017
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,000
YOU ABOUT, YOU SAID THIS IS THE

3018
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
WORST YOU'VE SEEN.

3019
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
I KNOW YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL

3020
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
AGAIN AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A

3021
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
VENEER THAT YOU PUT UP.

3022
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
WERE YOU EMOTIONAL AT ANY POINT?

3023
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
DID THIS GET TO YOU AT ANY POINT

3024
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
WHERE YOU HAD TO FIGHT BACK

3025
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,000
TEARS?
>> NOT YET.

3026
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
OKAY?
BUT YEAH, THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES

3027
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
IN MY CAREER WHEN I'VE FOR

3028
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
REASONS I DON'T APPRECIATE GO IN

3029
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
THE LOCKER ROOM AND SIT DOWN AND

3030
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
CRY, BUT -- AND I THINK IF

3031
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
YOU -- IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO

3032
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
THAT, YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN THIS

3033
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
BUSINESS, BUT FOR THIS ONE, NOT
YET.

3034
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:51,000
NOTICE I SAID YET.

3035
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,000
ALL RIGHT, FOLKS.

3036
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

3037
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
>> COULD YOU SAY AND SPELL YOUR

3038
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
NAME.
>> YEAH, SURE.

3039
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
I HOPE YOU ALL PUT THIS IN YOUR

3040
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,000
CALENDAR BECAUSE IN 31 YEARS,

3041
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
AND 26 AS CHIEF MEDICAL

3042
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
EXAMINER, THIS IS ONLY THE

3043
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,000
SECOND PRESS CONFERENCE I'VE

3044
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:17,000
GIVEN.
IT'S H. WAYNE W-A-Y-N-E, CARVER,

3045
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,000
C-A-AREN'T V-E-R, AND IT'S THE

3046
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
SECOND.
THAT'S WHY I DON'T USE THE H.

3047
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:29,000
BECAUSE WHEN MY FATHER ASKED MY

3048
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
GRANDFATHER, HE SAID FINE, BUT

3049
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
AS LONG AS YOU NEVER CALL HIM

3050
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
HAROLD.

3051
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
>> CAN YOU JUST REAL QUICKLY,

3052
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
DID THEY SET UP A TENT IN THE

3053
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
PARKING LOT?

3054
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
>> IT WASN'T A TENT.

3055
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,000
IT WAS THIS MAGNIFICENT THING.

3056
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
AND IT'S SECTIONAL AND IT STICKS

3057
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:51,000
TOGETHER WITH VELCRO AND THEN

3058
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
THEY STAKE IT TO THE GROUND AND

3059
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:54,000
ELECTRICITY AND LIGHTS APPEAR

3060
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY

3061
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
MANAGEMENT.
I THINK IT CAME FROM THE ARMY

3062
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,000
BUT I'M NOT SURE.

3063
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,000
I THINK IT'S THESE THINGS THAT

3064
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
THEY USE IN TO SET UP FIELD

3065
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
HOSPITALS VERY QUICKLY, MOBILE

3066
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
HOSPITALS.

3067
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
>> HAVE ALL OF THE CHILDREN'S

3068
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
BODIES BEEN RETURNED TO THE

3069
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
PATIENTS OR MORTUARIES?

3070
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
>> I DON'T KNOW THE MORTUARIES

3071
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000

SIR?

3175
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
SIR?

LOCATION OF ANY OF THE WEAPONRY

3177
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
AT ALL.
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

3178
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,000
SPECULATION OUT THERE RELATIVE

3179
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000

3180
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,000

HOLD THAT QUESTION UNTIL

PROBABLY TOMORROW MORNING, OKAY?

3185
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,000
YES, SIR.

>> OKAY.

3192
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,000
FIRST QUESTION I CANNOT ANSWER.

3193
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,000
I'LL HAVE TO GET THAT

3194
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,000
INFORMATION FOR YOU.

IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

3197
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
THE SECOND QUESTION IS, THERE

3198
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,000
HAS BEEN TALK AND SPECULATION

3199
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,000
ABOUT THAT.
BUT IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
WEAPONRY IN HER HOUSE WHEN SHE

3206
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:21,000
HAD A SON THAT HAD SOME MENTAL

3207
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
ISSUES?
>> THAT'S SOMETHING CERTAINLY WE

3208
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
NEED TO LOOK AT AND OUR

3209
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,000

THEIR INVESTIGATION.

3212
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
>> THAT'S PRETTY LARGE FIRE

3213
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
POWER.

3214
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000

YES, SIR.
>> DOES THAT MEAN THAT NO

ALTERCATION HAPPENED OR THERE IS

NO INFORMATION?

3219
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
>> THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTS

SPEAKING WITH THE

3234
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
SUPERINTENDENT, THERE WAS NO

3235
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
RELATION AT ALL.

3236
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
ONE MORE QUESTION.

3237
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,000
ONE MORE QUESTION.

3238
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
>> CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE

LATINO FAMILIES THAT NEED HELP

3240

WITH COMMUNICATION?

3241
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
>> WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE

3242
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,000
AND I WOULD BE NEGLECTFUL NOT TO

01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,000
MENTION THIS.

3244
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000

THE SUPPORT OUTSIDE OF THE

COMMUNITY HAS BEEN MORE THAN

3250
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
OUTSTANDING.

3251
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
THE OUTPOURING OF ASSISTANCE,

3304
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000

OF THE WEAPONRY, THE OWNERSHIP

3313
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000

AT THIS POINT THEY ARE RELEASING

3315
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000

3316
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
HE SAID THEY HAVEN'T EVEN

COMMUNITY, HE SAYS, HAS BEEN

3326
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,000

HAD SOME INFORMATION THAT HE

3335
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000

3339
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,000
HE BELIEVES THAT THE CHILDREN

3340
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
ALL WERE FIRST GRADERS WHO WERE

3341
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,000

01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
CHILDREN.

3350
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
AND THAT THE MORTUARIES HAD HAD

3351
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
ALL BEEN CALLED, MEANING AT THAT

3352
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
POINT THEY WOULD BE READY TO

3353
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
DELIVER THE BODIES BACK TO THE

3354
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
FAMILIES OF THE CHILDREN SO FAR.

3355
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,000
HE SAID THAT THERE WERE

3356
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000

01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
THOSE EXAMINATIONS, THOSE

3360
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,000
POSTMORTEMS WILL BE DONE

3361
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000

3362
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
WOUNDS.

3363
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
HE SAID THAT THE WOUNDS WERE

3364
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
CAUSED BY ONE WEAPON.

3365
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
AT LEAST THOSE THEY'VE LOOKED AT

3366
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
SO FAR AND THAT WAS THE

3367
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE.
HE SAID HE HIMSELF DID SEVEN

3368
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
AUTOPSIES AND TWO OF THEM WERE

3369
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
CLOSE-RANGE SHOOTINGS AND HE

3370
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,000
SAID HE USED PICTURES FROM THE

3371
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
FAMILY MEMBERS TO I.D. THOSE

3372
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,000
BODIES.

3373
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
HE SAID THAT AS LONG AS HE HAS

3374
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
BEEN DOING THIS, IT WAS A VERY

3375
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
TOUGH THING THAT WHILE HE WAS

3376
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,000
HOLDING UP WELL, HE HAS A LOT OF

3377
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
EXPERIENCE, HE SAID HE HAS NOT

3378
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
COLLAPSED EMOTIONALLY YET,

3379
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
ECHLZING THE WORD YET, BECAUSE

3380
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,000
HE SAID THIS IS ONE OF THE

3381
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
TOUGHEST THINGS HE HAS SEEN IN

3382
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
HIS CAREER.

3383
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
HE BELIEVES THAT EVERYBODY OF

3384
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
THE 26 KILLED, AND THEN THE TWO

3385
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,000
OTHERS, INCLUDING THE SHOOTER
AND HIS MOTHER, OF THOSE 26, HE

3386
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
SAYS HE BELIEVES THAT EACH ONE

3387
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
WAS HIT BY MORE THAN ONE BULLET.

3388
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
WOUNDS DESCRIBED WHEN HE WAS

3389
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:55,000
ASKED BY REPORTERS, HE SAID ALL

3390
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
OVER.
AND GAVE SOME DETAILS.

3391
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
BUT NOT VERY MANY ABOUT THE

3392
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
SCENE INSIDE OF THAT SHOOTING.

3393
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
SO WE'RE GETTING A FEW MORE

3394
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
DETAILS FROM THE MEDICAL

3395
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
EXAMINER WHO WE HAVE BEEN

3396
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
WAITING TO HEAR FROM.

3397
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
AND ALSO FROM THE LIEUTENANT

3398
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
VANCE FROM THE STATE POLICE WHO

3399
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
SAID THIS WOULD BE IT IN TERMS

3400
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
OF UPDATES FOR THE REST OF THE

3401
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
DAY.

3402
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
THEY HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD AT

3403
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
UPDATING REPORTERS DURING THE

3404
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
DAY.

3405
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,000
BUT ALSO REMINDING THEM THEY

3406
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
WANT THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHOSE

3407
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
CHILDREN ARE DECEASED TO BE LEFT

3408
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
ALONE, LEFT IN SOLITUDE AS THEY

3409
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
ARE GRAPPLING WITH THIS

3410
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE.

3411
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
SO THAT IS THEIR UPDATE FROM

3412
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,000
THIS EVENING PRESS CONFERENCE,

3413
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,000
THE LAST ONE OF THE DAY.

3414
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
AND, OF COURSE, THEY WERE THEN

3415
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
ABLE TO RELEASE THE NAMES OF

3416
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED WHO

3417
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE THE

3418
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
POSTMORTEMS ON.

3419
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,000
SO THAT IS WHERE IT STANDS RIGHT

3420
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,000
NOW.
DEB FEYERICK IS UPDATING FOR US

3421
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,000

3422
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
AND I WANT TO THROW IT RIGHT

3423
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,000

01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
ALLEGED SHOOTER, ADAM LANZA.

3431
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
APPARENTLY HE DID LIVE ALONE

3432
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
WITH HIS MOTHER.

3433
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,000
THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH EARLIER

3434
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
REPORTS THAT AFTER A SEPARATION

3435
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
FOLLOWED BY A DIVORCE THAT HE

3436
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
WAS WITH HIS MOTHER, LIVING IN

3437
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
THAT HOME.

3438
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,000
THE MOTHER -- THERE'S A BIG

3439
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
QUESTION AS TO WHY THIS SCHOOL.

3440
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,000
WHY THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL.

3441
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
WELL, IT APPEARS THE MOTHER,

3442
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
ACCORDING TO THIS SOURCE, WAS

3443
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
NOT A TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL.

3444
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
SHE MAY HAVE HAD A MINOR ROLE, A

3445
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
SUBSTITUTE OR AN AIDE.

3446
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
THEY'RE STILL LOOKING INTO WHAT

3447
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,000
SHE DID THERE.

3448
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
BUT SHE WAS DEFINITELY NOT AN

3449
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
ON-STAFF TEACHER, ACCORDING TO

3450
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
THIS SOURCE.

3451
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,000
FROM EVERYTHING LAW ENFORCEMENT

3452
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
HAS SEEN SO FAR, THE ALLEGED

3453
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,000
SHOOTER ACTED ALONE.

3454
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
AUTHORITIES ARE FURTHER LOOKING

3455
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,000
INTO WHAT HE MAY HAVE SUFFERED

3456
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
FROM.

3457
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
WHAT HIS MENTAL ISSUES WERE OR

3458
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
HIS MENTAL STATE, HIS MENTAL

3459
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,000
CONDITION.

3460
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
THE SOURCE WOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY

3461
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
DETAILS, NOR WOULD POLICE, AS A

3462
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
MATTER OF FACT.

3463
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,000
THEY ARE REFUSING TO SPECULATE

3464
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,000
ON ANY POSSIBLE MENTAL

3465
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
CONDITIONS THAT HE MAY OR MAY

3466
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
NOT HAVE HAD.

3467
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,000
THEY ARE CHECKING.

3468
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE CHECKING TO

3469
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,000
SEE WHO THE SHOOTER, ADAM LANZA,

3470
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
THE ALLEGED SHOOTER KNEW, EITHER

3471
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
SOCIALLY, PROFESSIONALLY, WHO

3472
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
HIS TEACHERS WERE, WHAT DOCTORS

3473
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
HE MAY HAVE BEEN SEEING.

3474
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
THERE'S STILL A FATHER IN THIS

3475
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,000
PICTURE, WHO LIVES IN ANOTHER

3476
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
TOWN, A COUPLE MILES AWAY.

3477
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO LEARN AS MUCH

3478
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
AS THEY CAN ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN

3479
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
AND WHY HE DID WHAT HE DID.

3480
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
ALSO, WE'RE BEING TOLD BY AN

3481
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
INVESTIGATOR THAT THE MOM --

3482
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
AGAIN, NOT CLEAR WHETHER SHE WAS

3483
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
A SUBSTITUTE OR MAY HAVE BEEN

3484
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,000
UNEMPLOYED.
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM, AT LEAST

3485
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
NOT RIGHT NOW, THAT FINANCIAL

3486
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
ISSUES PLAYED ANY SORT OF A ROLE

3487
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
IN WHAT HAPPENED OR WHY IT

3488
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
HAPPENED.
THE SOURCE ALSO SAID THERE IS A

3489
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,000
QUESTION OF IDENTIFICATION

3490
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
INITIALLY.
THE BROTHER, RYAN LANZA, HAD

3491
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,000
BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE POTENTIAL

3492
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,000
SHOOTER.
BUT APPARENTLY WE ARE TOLD BY

3493
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
AUTHORITIES THAT THE ALLEGED

3494
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
SHOOTER, ADAM LANZA, DID NOT

3495
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,000
HAVE ANY IDENTIFICATION ON HIM

3496
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,000
BELONGING TO HIS BROTHER WHEN HE

3497
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:50,000
WAS FOUND.

3498
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:55,000
AND YOU COMMENTED ON IT, AND THE

3499
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
PARENTS WERE NOT ABLE TO

3500
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,000
IDENTIFY THEIR CHILDREN BY GOING

3501
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,000
TO SEE THEIR CHILDREN.

3502
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINERS ACTUALLY

3503
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,000
TOOL PHOTOS SO THE PARENTS COULD

3504
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
IDENTIFY THEIR CHILDREN THAT

3505
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
WAY.
AND THAT JUST HAS TO BE SO

3506
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
PAINFUL.
SO OVERWHELMING.
AND RIGHT NOW, SO MANY PEOPLE

3507
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,000
ARE OVERWHELMED WITH GRIEF AND

3508
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
SADNESS AND PAIN, MISSING THEIR

3509
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,000
LOVED ONES, TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

3510
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,000
WHAT HAPPENED.

3511
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CANNOT

3512
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:23,000
BE UNDERSTOOD.

3513
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,000
>>> WELCOME, EVERYBODY.

3514
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
WE'RE COMING TO YOU LIVE THIS

3515
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
AFTERNOON AS WE CONTINUE TO

3516
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,000
COVER AN ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY HERE

3517
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
AT CONNECTICUT, THE CONNECTICUT

3518
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING.

3519
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
LOTS TO UPDATE YOU ON AS IN THE

3520
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000

SOME OF THE LATEST DETAILS ABOUT

3525
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,000
THIS CASE.

3526
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
YOU JUST HEARD A MOMENT AGO DEB

3527
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
FEYERICK GIVING US THE VERY

3528
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000

FROM -- DETAILS ABOUT THE

3530
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
SHOOTER.

3531
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
AND, OF COURSE, AT THIS POINT

3532
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
THERE ARE REALLY NO MORE WORDS,

3533
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,000
ONLY HOPE, I GUESS, IN SOME WAYS

3534
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
THAT THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO

3535
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
HAVE LOST EVERYTHING, THEIR

3536
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
PRIZE POSSESSION, THEIR

3537
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
CHILDREN.

3538
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
FAMILIES HERE IN NEWTOWN,

3539
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:13,000
CONNECTICUT WILL SOME DAY BE

3540
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
ABLE TO FIND THEIR WAY THROUGH
THIS TERRIBLE GRIEF AND THEN THE

3541
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,000
NATION WILL COME TO GRIPS WITH

3542
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,000
YET ANOTHER TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

3543
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
SO WE BEGIN TODAY WITH WHAT WE

3544
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,000
KNOW SO FAR ABOUT THIS SCHOOL

3545
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
SHOOTING.

3546
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
ALL THE VICTIMS HAVE NOW BEEN

3547
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
REMOVED FROM THE SCHOOL.

3548
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,000
THEY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED,

3549
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
POSTMORTEMS HAVE BEEN DONE.

3550
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
SOURCES TOLD INVESTIGATORS THAT

3551
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
THE ALLEGED SHOOTER, ADAM LANZA,

3552
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
WAS INVOLVED IN AN ALTERCATION

3553
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

3554
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
WITH FOUR ADULTS THURSDAY AND

3555
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,000
THREE OF THOSE ADULTS WERE

3556
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
KILLED ON FRIDAY.
BUT WE JUST HEARD AN UPDATE A

3557
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
MOMENT AGO COMING TO US FROM THE

3558
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT THE SOURCE WHERE

3559
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,000
HE SAID THAT THEY HAD NO

3560
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,000
INFORMATION, IN FACT, ABOUT A

3561
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
CONFRONTATION.
SO THAT IS SOME CONTRADICTORY

3562
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

3563
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
THERE.
WE ALSO KNOW THAT LANZA

3564
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,000
SUPPOSEDLY TRIED TO BUY A GUN AT

3565
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
A SPORTING GOODS STORE NEAR

3566
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,000
NEWTOWN ON TUESDAY.

3567
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
HE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.

3568
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
NO DETAILS AT THIS POINT,

3569
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
THOUGH, ON WHY EXACTLY HE WAS

3570
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
UNSUCCESSFUL.
HE LIVED ALONE WITH HIS MOTHER,

3571
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
NANCY, WHO HE KILLED BEFORE HE

3572
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
WENT ON THAT RAMPAGE AT THE

3573
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,000
SCHOOL.

3574
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
HIS MOTHER WAS NOT A TEACHER, WE

3575
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,000
NOW KNOW, AT THE SCHOOL.

3576
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,000
BUT SHE MAY HAVE HAD SOME KIND

3577
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
OF A ROLE AT THE SCHOOL AS A

3578
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,000
SUBSTITUTE TEACHER OR POSSIBLY

3579
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,000
AN AIDE.

3580
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
LANZA DID NOT HAVE HIS BROTHER

3581
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,000
RYAN'S IDENTIFICATION ON HIM

3582
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
WHEN, IN FACT, HIS BODY WAS

3583
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
FOUND.
THAT WAS OTHER CONTRADICTORY

3584
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,000
INFORMATION THAT WE WERE HEARING

3585
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,000
YESTERDAY.
SO ALL OF THIS AT THIS POINT

3586
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
LEAVES US WITH MANY MORE

3587
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT A

3588
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
POSSIBLE MOTIVE OF THE SUSPECTED

3589
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,000
SHOOTER.

3590
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
MARY SNOW HAS A CLOSER LOOK AT

3591
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
THAT FOR US.

3592
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,000
>> SHORTLY AFTER FRIDAY'S

3593
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
HORRIFIC SHOOTINGS, POLICE AND

3594
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,000
S.W.A.T. TEAMS DESCENDED UPON

3595
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,000
THE LANZA HOME.

3596
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,000
YOU CAN'T SEE IT.

3597
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,000
IT'S BIND ME.

3598
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,000
AND IT'S CLOSED OFF BY POLICE.

3599
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,000
AND INVESTIGATORS ARE NOW

3600
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,000
SUGGESTING THAT THEY ARE PIECING

3601
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
TOGETHER INFORMATION LEADING TO

3602
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
POSSIBLE ANSWERS ABOUT HOW AND

3603
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
WHY THIS HAPPENED.

3604
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
LIEUTENANT PAUL VANCE OF THE

3605
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE SAYING

3606
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
THAT IN HIS WORDS, GOOD EVIDENCE

3607
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
IS BEING RECOVERED BUT HE DID

3608
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,000
NOT GO INTO DETAIL.

3609
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:10,000
IN TERMS OF THE WEAPONS USED, WE

3610
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,000
DO KNOW THAT THREE WEAPONS WERE

3611
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
RECOVERED AT THE SCENE OF THE

3612
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
SHOOTING NEAR THE SUSPECT'S

3613
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,000
BODY.
THERE WERE TWO HANDGUNS AND A

3614
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE.

3615
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
CNN HAS BEEN REPORTING THAT

3616
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
THOSE GUNS WERE PURCHASED BY HIS

3617
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,000
MOTHER, NANCY LANZA.

3618
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
AND THERE'S NOT MUCH WE DO KNOW

3619
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000
ABOUT NANCY LANZA.

3620
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:32,000
WE SPOKE TO A NEIGHBOR EARLIER

3621
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
IN THE DAY, AND SHE SAID SHE

3622
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
KNEW HER, BUT THERE WAS NOTHING

3623
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
OUT OF THE ORDINARY THAT SHE

3624
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
COULD SEE.

3625
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,000
>> SHE WAS LIKE A NORMAL --

3626
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,000
ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS

3627
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.
YOU KNOW, DECORATE THE HOUSE,

3628
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,000
AND THE HOUSE WAS ALWAYS, YOU

3629
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
KNOW, PRISTINE.

3630
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
SHE WAS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER

3631
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
HOUSEWIFE.
>> Reporter: AS FOR ADAM LANZA,

3632
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
FORMER CLASSMATES DESCRIBE HIM

3633
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
AS BEING A SMART STUDENT,

3634
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
SOMEONE WHO WAS QUIET, KEPT TO

3635
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
HIMSELF, A NEIGHBOR WHO KNEW HIM

3636
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
IN RECENT YEARS DESCRIBED HIM AS

3637
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:07,000
TROUBLED.
MARY SNOW, CNN, NEWTOWN,

3638
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
CONNECTICUT.
>> WE WANT TO BRING IN CHIEF

3639
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. SANJAY

3640
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
GUPTA.
LET'S FIRST TALK ABOUT THE

3641
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
CHILDREN.
POST TRAUMATIC STRESS.

3642
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
AS THE DAY GOES ON, YOU SEE SOME

3643
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
OF THE PARENTS WALKING AROUND

3644
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
WITH THEIR -- THEIR CHILDREN,

3645
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
COMING TO SOME OF THESE

3646
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
MEMORIALS THAT HAVE BEEN SET UP.

3647
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
IS THAT A GOOD THING OR BETTER

3648
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:26,000
THING TO NOT BRING THE CHILDREN

3649
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,000
AROUND?
>> EVERYONE WE'VE BEEN TALKING

3650
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
TO -- WE WENT TO THE CRISIS

3651
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
CENTER, WHICH HAS BEEN SET UP

3652
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
HERE AT ANOTHER ELEMENTARY

3653
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
SCHOOL, REED ELEMENTARY.
AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU TALK TO

3654
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
OVER THERE SAY IT IS A GOOD

3655
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
THING.
AND, IN FACT, IF YOU GO TO THAT

3656
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
PARKING LOT -- I DIDN'T KNOW

3657
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
WHAT TO EXPECT THERE.

3658
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S SET UP AT A

3659
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
DIFFERENT SCHOOL.
BUT IT WAS FULL.

3660
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
AND WHAT I ALSO NOTICED, PEOPLE

3661
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,000
WERE GOING IN, FAMILIES, SMALL

3662
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
CHILDREN, AND THEY WERE STAYING

3663
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,000
FOR A LONG TIME.

3664
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
SO THIS WASN'T A SORT OF QUICK

3665
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
IN AND OUT SORT OF THING.

3666
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
THE WHOLE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SET

3667
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
UP AS A COUNSELING CENTER.

3668
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
SO PSYCHIATRISTS, PSYCHOLOGISTS,

3669
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,000
CHILDREN'S COUNSELORS

3670
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,000
SPECIFICALLY IN THERE.

3671
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,000
SO THEY'RE ENCOURAGING THIS.

3672
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,000
AND THE WAY THEY SORT OF PUT IT

3673
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,000
TO ME, YOU THINK ABOUT THE

3674
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
COMMUNITY SORT OF AS AN

3675
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
INDIVIDUAL ITSELF.

3676
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
MEANING THAT THE IDEA THAT

3677
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,000
PEOPLE ALL SORT OF REALIZE

3678
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,000
THEY'RE IN IT TOGETHER, AT LEAST

3679
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
DOES SOMETHING TO MITIGATE THOSE

3680
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,000
FEELINGS OF ISOLATION WHICH CAN

3681
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,000
BE SO PROBLEMATIC.

3682
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
SO GOOD THING, IS WHAT I'M

3683
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,000
HEARING.
EVERYTHING YOU'RE SEEING AROUND

3684
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
YOU RIGHT NOW, THIS IS -- I

3685
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,000
THINK WHAT THEY WANT.

3686
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
>> WHAT WILL THEY DO FOR THE

3687
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
CHILDREN?

3688
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:29,000
KATE BOLDUAN HAD A REMARKABLE
STORY OF A LITTLE BOY SHE.

3689
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
SHE TALKED TO HIS PARENTS WHO

3690
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,000
RAN PAST THE SHOOTER, KILLING

3691
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
HIS TEACHER AND KILLING SOME OF

3692
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
HIS CLASSMATES.

3693
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,000
HOW DOES A CHILD LIKE THAT WHO

3694
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
AT THIS MOMENT SHE DESCRIBED AS

3695
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,000
CALM AND MATTER OF FACT AND

3696
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,000
HELPFUL TO DETECTIVES.

3697
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
BUT ONE HAS TO IMAGINE DOWN THE

3698
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
ROAD, HE'S GOING TO BE

3699
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,000
COMPLETELY TRAUMATIZED.

3700
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,000
>> YES.

3701
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,000
AND PTSD IS SOMETHING WE'RE USED

3702
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
TO TALKING ABOUT WITH ADULTS.

3703
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
BUT YOU KNOW, I DID A LITTLE BIT

3704
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
OF RESEARCH, BECAUSE THERE ARE

3705
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:55,000
SOME STUDIES ON LOOKING AT KIDS

3706
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
SPECIFICALLY.
AND WHAT YOU FIND IS AFTER THIS

3707
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,000
SORT OF THING, ESPECIALLY IF

3708
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
SOMEONE HAS SEEN THE VIOLENCE,

3709
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
THIS IS A BIG SORT OF PIVOT

3710
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,000
POINT.

3711
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
BEING IN THE SCHOOL, OBVIOUSLY,

3712
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,000
PROBLEMATIC.

3713
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
BEING IN THE COMMUNITY,

3714
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,000
OBVIOUSLY OF CONCERN.

3715
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
EVEN IN THIS COUNTRY.
BUT IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, THE

3716
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
RATES ARE MUCH HIGHER, AS YOU

3717
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
MIGHT GUESS.

3718
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
77% OF PEOPLE, EVEN 3 TO 4

3719
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
MONTHS OUT, HAD EVIDENCE OF

3720
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
PTSD.

3721
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
NOW, CHILDREN TEND TO BE MORE

3722
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,000
RESILIENT, AND BY THAT, YOU

3723
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,000
KNOW, GETTING BACK INTO SOME

3724
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
SORT OF NORMAL PATTERN OF

3725
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,000
BEHAVIOR SEEMS TO MAKE A BIG

3726
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,000
DIFFERENCE.

3727
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
BUT YOU KNOW, WE TALK ABOUT THIS

3728
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:28,000
STUFF ALL THE TIME.
THERE ISN'T A LOT OF PRECEDENT.

3729
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
WE WOULD LIKE TO SAY WE HAVE

3730
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
TONS OF STUDIES TO BASE THIS ON.

3731
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
WHAT WE'RE REPORTING ON IS A

3732
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
FAIRLY UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION

3733
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:38,000
IN TERMS OF ITS SCOPE WITH THIS

3734
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
AGE CHILDREN.

3735
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,000
>> THERE WAS A QUESTION THROWN

3736
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
TO LIEUTENANT VANCE, THE GUY

3737
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
HOLDING ALL THESE PRESS

3738
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
CONFERENCES, AND THEY WERE
ASKING ABOUT THE MENTAL STATE OF

3739
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
THE ALLEGED SHOOTER, WHO IS --

3740
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
THEY STILL HAVE NOT DONE A

3741
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
POSTMORTEM ON HIM, AND THEY'RE

3742
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,000
RELEASING VERY LITTLE
INFORMATION.

3743
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
IS THERE A CONNECTION BETWEEN

3744
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,000
THESE MOOSE KILLINGS AND PEOPLE

3745
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL?

3746
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
IS IT -- OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID,

3747
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,000
I KNOW HIS BROTHER SAID THAT HE

3748
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
HAD A KIND OF AUTISM.

3749
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
HE TOLD AUTHORITIES APPARENTLY
THAT.

3750
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
IS THERE ANY CORRELATION BETWEEN

3751
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:10,000
AUTISM AND ANY KIND OF VIOLENCE?

3752
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,000
MY NEPHEW IS AUTISTIC AND I

3753
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
DON'T KNOW OF ANY STUDIES THAT

3754
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
LINK THAT.

3755
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
>> I THINK THERE AREN'T ANY

3756
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
STUDIES.
AND TWO POINTS HERE.

3757
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
FIRST OF ALL, I WOULDN'T THINK

3758
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:21,000
OF AUTISM AS A MENTAL ILLNESS.

3759
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:24,000
IT IS A NEURAL DEVELOPMENTAL

3760
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
DISORDER.

3761
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,000
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE STUDIES,

3762
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
WHATOU FIND IS WHILE THERE IS

3763
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
A POSSIBILITY OF MORE OUTBURSTS,

3764
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
SORT OF REACTIVE VIOLENCE, THE

3765
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
IDEA OF PLANNED VIOLENCE WHERE

3766
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:36,000
SOMEONE ACTUALLY PLANS OUT

3767
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
SOMETHING METHODICALLY, THAT

3768
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
DOESN'T CORRELATE.

3769
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
THE BEST STUDY, ONE EVERYONE

3770
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
QUOTES, A STUDY OF 132 PATIENTS,

3771
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
NOT THAT BIG A STUDY, BUT ONE OF

3772
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
THE BEST ONES OUT THERE, ONLY 3

3773
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
PEOPLE IN THAT 132-PEOPLE STUDY

3774
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
HAD ANY EVIDENCE OF SPECIFIC

3775
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
VIOLENCE.

3776
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
AND EVEN THAT AGAIN WAS MAINLY

3777
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,000
REACTIVE.

3778
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
NOT THIS SORT OF PLANNED

3779
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
VIOLENCE.
I DON'T THINK THERE IS A LINK.

3780
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
>> AS YOU KNOW, IF YOU GO

3781
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,000
ONLINE, THE DISCUSSION AND

3782
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
DEBATE AROUND THIS TERRIBLE

3783
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
TRAGEDY IS CATEGORIZED INTO A

3784
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,000
GUN DEBATE.
INTO A DEBATE ABOUT BRINGING

3785
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
AWARENESS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND A

3786
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
LACK OF HELP FOR MANY PEOPLE AND

3787
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

3788
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
LOTS OF CUTS THERE.

3789
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
AND WHERE THE TWO OF THOSE

3790
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,000
THINGS INTERSECT.

3791
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
AND, AGAIN, NOT A LOT IS KNOWN

3792
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,000
ABOUT THE SHOOTER SO IT'S HARD

3793
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,000
TO SAY.
TALK ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH

3794
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,000
ASPECT.

3795
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT GUNS AND GUN

3796
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
CONTROL.

3797
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
MANY CUTS WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS

3798
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,000
COUNTRY ON MENTAL HEALTH.

3799
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
AND IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

3800
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,000
MENTALLY ILL SOMETIMES TO GET

3801
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
HELP.

3802
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

3803
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
AND I'M GLAD YOU BRING IT UP.

3804
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
I'VE REPORTED ON THIS QUITE A

3805
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
BIT, AND I KNOW YOU HAVE, AS

3806
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
WELL.
BUT THERE IS THIS WHOLE NOTION

3807
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:43,000
OF SOMETHING THEY CALL PARITY.

3808
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
AND WHAT THAT MEANS, DO YOU

3809
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
TREAT MENTAL ILLNESS THE SAME AS

3810
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
PHYSICAL ILLNESS, DIABETES OR

3811
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
HEART DISEASE, THEY GO TO THE

3812
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
DOCTOR.
WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, OFTENTIMES

3813
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,000
IT'S VERY HARD TO EVEN GET THE

3814
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
DIAGNOSIS BECAUSE OF LACK OF

3815
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
RESOURCES.
AND EVEN HARDER TO GET

3816
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:00,000
TREATMENT, BECAUSE OF LACK OF

3817
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,000
RESOURCES.
SO YOU KNOW, IT ISN'T ALWAYS

3818
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
JUST MISSING THE WARNING SIGNS.

3819
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:06,000
FAMILIES MAY SEE THE WARNING

3820
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,000
SIGNS.
COMMUNITY MEMBERS MAY SEE

3821
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
WARNING SIGNS.
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU

3822
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
DO AFTER THAT?

3823
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
ARE THERE RESOURCES IN PLACE?

3824
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
AND I THINK THESE CUTS THAT YOU

3825
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
TALK ABOUT -- AGAIN, WE DON'T

3826
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE

3827
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
SPECIFICALLY.
BUT WITH REGARD TO --

3828
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,000
>> OR THAT MENTAL ILLNESS IS

3829
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,000
INVOLVED IN ANY WAY.

3830
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
>> RIGHT.
>> OR EVEN THAT AUTISM IS

3831
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,000
INVOLVED IN ANY WAY, BECAUSE WE

3832
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,000
HAVE NOT THAT MUCH INFORMATION

3833
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
ABOUT THE SHOOTER ARE.

3834
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
WE DON'T KNOW.

3835
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
BUT WITH REGARD TO MENTAL

3836
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,000
ILLNESS, MORE SORT OF GLOBALLY,

3837
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
YEAH, IT'S INCREDIBLY

3838
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
CHALLENGING TO GET THAT.

3839
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,000
AND THAT PARITY ISSUE IS

3840
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,000
SOMETHING THAT'S COME UP WITH

3841
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
REGARD TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE

3842
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,000
ACT, WITH REGARD TO HOW WE SPEND

3843
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
RESOURCES GOING FORWARD.

3844
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:43,000
BECAUSE IT JUST -- IT ISN'T ON

3845
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,000
PAR WITH PHYSICAL DISEASE.

3846
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
A LOT OF TIMES WE CAN GET THESE

3847
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
PATIENTS CARED FOR QUICKLY FOR

3848
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
THINGS THAT YOU AND I CAN

3849
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
QUANTIFY, HEART DISEASE,

3850
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
DIABETES.
IF YOU THINK MENTAL ILLNESS IS

3851
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
ON THE SAME LEVEL, IT ISN'T IN

3852
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,000
THIS COUNTRY.

3853
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:58,000
>> I GUESS IT'S THE

3854
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,000
INTERSECTION, AT LEAST FOR ME,

3855
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
BETWEEN MENTAL ILLNESS AND

3856
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
ACCESS TO WEAPONS IS REALLY WHAT

3857
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
ENDS UP BECOMING THE TERRIFYING

3858
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
COMBINATION IN A LOT OF THESE

3859
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
CASES.

3860
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,000
WE'VE COVERED COLUMBINE.

3861
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:08,000
WE'VE COVERED VIRGINIA TECH.

3862
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
WE'VE COVERED A NUMBER OF THESE

3863
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
HORRIFIC SHOOTINGS.

3864
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,000
AND THERE NEVER SEEMS TO BE --

3865
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY TODAY IS NOT

3866
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,000
THE DAY TO DISCUSS IT.

3867
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
AND I'M GOING TO DISAGREE.

3868
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO DISCUSS

3869
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
IT.
BOTH MENTAL ILLNESS AND WEAPONS

3870
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,000
THAT ARE AVAILABLE SO READILY IN

3871
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
THIS COUNTRY.
>> YEAH.

3872
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:26,000
YOU KNOW, I THINK CERTAINLY AS A

3873
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:27,000
DOCTOR, I THINK YOU DO SEIZE THE

3874
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THESE

3875
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,000
THINGS.
AND WITH REGARD TO MENTAL

3876
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,000
ILLNESS, I THINK IT JUST GETS

3877
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,000
SHORT SHRIFT EVERY SINGLE TIME.

3878
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,000
SO THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE

3879
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,000
PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO THIS

3880
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
ISSUE RIGHT NOW, IT MAY LIGHT A

3881
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
LITTLE BIT OF A TORCH.

3882
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,000
AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

3883
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,000
IT IS THAT INTERSECTION.

3884
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,000
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT

3885
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
INTERSECTION IS GOING TO LIE,

3886
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,000
EXACTLY HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO

3887
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
FOCUS ON MENTAL ILLNESS VERSUS

3888
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
GUNS OR VICE VERSA, BUT I THINK

3889
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,000
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

3890
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,000
>> YOU HAVE THREE DAUGHTERS.

3891
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,000
THEY'RE SORT OF IN THE SAME AGE

3892
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,000
RANGE.
WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM?

3893
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:56,000
DO YOU LET THEM WATCH TV?

3894
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
DO YOU TELL THEM NOT TO WATCH

3895
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
TV?
DO YOU EXPLAIN WHY YOU'RE HERE

3896
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:00,000
REPORTING OR DO YOU NOT TELL

3897
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,000
THEM THINGS?

3898
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
>> I HAVEN'T -- THEY HAVEN'T

3899
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
BEEN WATCHING TELEVISION.

3900
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,000
BUT THEY STILL KNOW.

3901
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE THING
THAT'S PROBABLY CHANGED SINCE

3902
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,000
OUR KIDS WERE BORN.

3903
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,000
WE THINK BY TURNING OFF THE

3904
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,000
TELEVISION THAT COULD INSULATE,

3905
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,000
AND IT DOESN'T.

3906
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
MY 7-YEAR-OLD STILL KNEW BECAUSE

3907
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,000
SOCIAL MEDIA AND HER FRIENDS IN

3908
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
SCHOOL ARE TALKING ABOUT IT.

3909
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,000
SHE CALLED ME.

3910
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
I WAS ACTUALLY IN LOS ANGELES.

3911
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,000
SHE CALLED ME ON THE PHONE AND

3912
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
WE TALKED.
AND I SAID TO HER, YOU KNOW -- I

3913
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
WAS VERY TRANSPARENT.

3914
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,000
I MEAN, I DIDN'T EXPOSE GRAPHIC

3915
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
DETAILS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

3916
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,000
BUT I THINK I WAS JUST VERY

3917
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,000
HONEST.
IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST

3918
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
HONEST CONVERSATIONS I HAD WITH

3919
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,000
MY 7-YEAR-OLD.
>> WHAT DID SHE WANT TO KNOW?

3920
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
>> SHE WANTED TO KNOW IF THIS

3921
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
COULD HAPPEN IN HER SCHOOL, WAS

3922
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:39,000
I THINK HER PRIMARY THING.

3923
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:40,000
AND SHE SAID SCHOOLS WERE

3924
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
SUPPOSED TO BE SAFE.

3925
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,000
THAT'S WHAT SHE ASKED ME.

3926
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,000
>> HOW DO YOU ANSWER THAT?

3927
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
BECAUSE SCHOOLS AREN'T SAFE.

3928
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,000
EXHIBIT A IS THIS SCHOOL IS NOT

3929
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:47,000
SAFE.

3930
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,000
>> I SAID FOR THE MOST PART THEY

3931
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
ARE SAFE.
BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS HAPPENED.

3932
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,000
I SAID THIS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME

3933
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,000
WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL.

3934
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
IT NEVER HAPPENED TO YOUR MOMMY

3935
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,000
WHEN SHE WENT TO SCHOOL.

3936
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,000
BUT IT OBVIOUSLY HAPPENED HERE.

3937
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,000
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR BEST

3938
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
TO TRY AND KEEP YOU SAFE.

3939
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
BUT, YEAH.

3940
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I WAS JUST VERY HONEST I THINK

3941
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,000
WITH HER.
I THINK NOT BEING HONEST

3942
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:04,000
PROBABLY IS THE WRONG ANSWER.

3943
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,000
AS MUCH AS IT'S MAYBE YOUR

3944
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,000
TENDENCY TO TRY AND PROTECT AS A

3945
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
PARENT.
BUT IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

3946
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
THE RIGHT WAY TO DEAL WITH IT.

3947
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
>> MY KIDS ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW

3948
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,000
IF SOMEONE DIED.

3949
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
DID ANYBODY DIE.

3950
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,000
THAT'S ALWAYS THEIR QUESTION.

3951
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:18,000
>> AND I TOLD HER -- YEAH, SHE

3952
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,000
KNEW THAT.

3953
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
AND I CONFIRMED THAT FOR HER.

3954
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,000
>> SUCH A TERRIBLE STORY.

3955
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,000
SANJAY, THANK YOU.

3956
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
WE APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT ON

3957
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
THIS.
>>> A COUPLE THINGS WE NOW KNOW

3958
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,000
ABOUT THIS CASE.

3959
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:28,000
POLICE ARE TELLING US THE GUNMAN

3960
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:32,000
FORCED HIS WAY INTO SANDY HOOK

3961
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
NO ONE LET HIM IN VOLUNTARILY.

3962
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,000
THE SCHOOL INSTALLED A NEW

3963
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:38,000
SECURITY SYSTEM.

3964
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
THE PRINCIPAL WHO CAME TO THE

3965
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
SCHOOL IN 2010 CREATED THE NEW

3966
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,000
SECURITY SYSTEM SO DOORS WOULD

3967
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
LOCK AT 9:30 A.M.

3968
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
VISITORS WERE SUPPOSED TO RING A

3969
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,000
BELL AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO

3970
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:47,000
GET CLEARANCE FROM THE FRONT

3971
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,000
OFFICE TO WALK THROUGH THOSE

3972
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,000
LOCKED DOORS.

3973
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:50,000
THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE LET IN.

3974
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE

3975
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
SHOOTER BURST INTO THE SCHOOL

3976
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:56,000
AND STARTED SHOOTING BEFORE OR

3977
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,000
AFTER 9:30 A.M.

3978
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:02,000
WE WANT TO GET TO LUKE A RETIRED

3979
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
POLICE OFFICER IN NEW YORK, NOW

3980
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
RUNS A RETIRED SECURITY AGENCY.

3981
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
WE KEEP HAVING THESE

3982
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,000
DISCUSSIONS.
HOW DO YOU PREVENT THIS TRAGEDY?

3983
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
AND SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY IT'S

3984
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
ABOUT GUNS AND OTHER PEOPLE, AS

3985
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
SANJAY AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT,

3986
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
WILL SAY IT'S ABOUT MENTAL

3987
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:20,000
HEALTH.
AND OTHERS WILL SAY EXAMINE THE

3988
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,000
SCHOOL OR PUT A GUARD OR POLICE

3989
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
OFFICER AT THE SCHOOL.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ANSWER IS?

3990
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,000
>> WELL, I SAID IN EARLIER

3991
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
DISCUSSION, I DON'T BELIEVE IN A

3992
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,000
SINGLE CAUSALITY.

3993
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,000
I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

3994
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:34,000
ISSUES THAT HAVE TO BE

3995
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,000
ADDRESSED.
CLEARLY, WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE

3996
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
GUN ISSUE IN OUR COUNTRY.

3997
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,000
I AM A SUPPORTER OF THE SECOND

3998
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:39,000
AMENDMENT.

3999
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,000
BUT I'M NOT A FOOL.

4000
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,000
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

4001
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MENTAL

4002
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,000
HEALTH.

4003
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO REVERT

4004
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:49,000
TO PUTTING ARMED SECURITY AT

4005
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
EVERY SCHOOL IN OUR COUNTRY, I

4006
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
THINK WE HAVE A RATHER HUGE

4007
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
UNDERTAKING.
AND I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT'S THE

4008
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:58,000
METHOD.
I DO THINK THAT FOR SCHOOLS,

4009
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:01,000
THOUGH, THEY SHOULD HAVE A TYPE

4010
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:02,000
OF SAFE ROOM WHICH COULD BE USED

4011
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,000
AS A CLASSROOM.

4012
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU CHANGE OR

4013
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,000
UPGRADE THE QUALITY OF THE DOOR,

4014
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
AND THE LOCKS.

4015
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
THEREFORE, IT MAKES IT VERY

4016
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
DIFFICULT TO PENETRATE THEM OR

4017
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
BREACH THEM.

4018
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,000
AND AS FAR AS THE ENTRY INTO THE

4019
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,000
SCHOOL, YOU KNOW, THE SCHOOLS

4020
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,000
ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

4021
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,000
THEY WANT TO BUZZ YOU IN.

4022
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
THE PROBLEM, AGAIN, AND AS WE

4023
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,000
SAW IN THIS INSTANCE, THIS

4024
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,000
INDIVIDUAL WAS DETERMINED TO

4025
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:23,000
ENTER THE SCHOOL.

4026
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:24,000
HE GOT IN.

4027
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
I DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE GOING

4028
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:31,000
TO COME TO ANY TYPE OF OVERNIGHT

4029
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:32,000
SOLUTION TO WHAT TRANSPIRED HERE

4030
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,000
TODAY.
I THINK WE HAVE TO REALLY JUST

4031
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND THE GRAVITY

4032
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
OF IT.
AND IN OUR HEARTS KNOW THAT WE

4033
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,000
WANT TO PREVENT IT.

4034
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
AND COME TO A COMMON GROUND

4035
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,000
INSTEAD OF MAKING THIS A

4036
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:42,000
POLITICAL ISSUE.

4037
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
WHICH IS WHAT IT'S BECOMING

4038
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
RIGHT NOW.

4039
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
AND ALSO, AN EDUCATIONAL ISSUE

4040
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
FOR THE PUBLIC.

4041
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
THIS THING ABOUT WEAPONS IN OUR

4042
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
COUNTRY IS DISTURBING.

4043
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:56,000
IT'S IRREFUTABLE.

4044
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 300
MILLION OF THEM THAT WE KEEP

4045
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,000
REPEATING THIS NUMBER.

4046
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:02,000
WE NEED TO ADDRESS WHO GETS

4047
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
THEM.
HOW THEY GET THEM.

4048
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,000
HOW THE PEOPLE ARE VETTED WHEN

4049
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:06,000
THEY ACQUIRE THEM.

4050
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
TRAINING ISSUES.

4051
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,000
EDUCATION AS TO SAFEGUARDING.

4052
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
DEALING WITH PEOPLE IN YOUR

4053
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:12,000
HOUSEHOLD WHO, IF THEY HAVE SOME

4054
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:16,000
TYPE OF MENTAL OR EMOTIONAL

4055
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,000
HANDICAP, PREVENTING THEM FROM

4056
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
GETTING ACCESS.
AND SHOULD YOU, IN FACT, EVEN

4057
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,000
HAVE THEM IN YOUR HOME IF YOU

4058
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,000
HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS GOT A

4059
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:24,000
MENTAL OR EMOTIONAL ISSUE.

4060
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
I MEAN, THERE'S A LOT OF TOPICS

4061
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,000
TO DISCUSS HERE.

4062
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,000
THE HEART-WRENCHING THING IS TO

4063
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
THINK THAT WE HAVE 20 BABIES

4064
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
THAT ARE NOW DECEASED.

4065
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
AND WE'RE ALL WONDERING, IS THIS

4066
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD HAVE

4067
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
DONE TO HAVE PREVENTED THIS.

4068
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,000
AND I'M NOT SURE THERE IS AN

4069
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:39,000
ANSWER THERE.

4070
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:42,000
YOU KNOW, MAYBE -- AND THIS IS

4071
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,000
JUST CONJECTURE.

4072
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:44,000
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE GUNS, AND

4073
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
SOMEONE WAS SO DETERMINED, HOW

4074
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
DO WE KNOW THEY WOULDN'T GET IN

4075
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,000
AN AUTOMOBILE AND DRIVE INTO A

4076
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
SCHOOL YARD, WHICH, IN FACT, IT

4077
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,000
HAPPENED ONE TIME, A COUPLE

4078
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,000
DECADES AGO.

4079
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
YOU KNOW, YOU ALMOST DON'T KNOW

4080
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,000
HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS INCIDENT,

4081
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A SHOCK TO

4082
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
YOUR SYSTEM.
BUT I DO KNOW THIS.

4083
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,000
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

4084
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
AND WE NEED TO BECOME SENSIBLE

4085
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
AND ABANDON THESE EXTREME

4086
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,000
POSITIONS WE HAVE IN THE NRA AND

4087
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
THE EXTREME LEFT LIBERAL.

4088
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,000
LIVE WITH THE FACT THAT WEAPONS

4089
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
ARE HERE TO STAY, THESE

4090
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:15,000
FIREARMS, AND HOW DO WE NOW

4091
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,000
RESPONSIBLY REGULATE POSSESSION

4092
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
OF THESE BY INDIVIDUALS.

4093
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
LET'S START BY KNOWING A LITTLE

4094
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
BIT MORE ABOUT YOU, OTHER THAN

4095
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,000
THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE NO

4096
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:23,000
CRIMINAL HISTORY.

4097
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
WE SHOULD PSYCHOLOGICALLY

4098
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
PROFILE EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHO

4099
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
THINKS THEY NEED A HANDGUN,

4100
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
ESPECIALLY OF THE TYPE OF THIS

4101
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
GLOCK OR SIG SAUER.

4102
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:34,000
>> BUT LOU?
>> YES, MA'AM.

4103
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,000
>> HOW REALISTIC IS THAT?

4104
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:38,000
AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE GIVING

4105
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,000
SOLUTIONS, BUT I HAVE COVERED SO

4106
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:43,000
MANY OF THESE TRAGEDIES, AND WE

4107
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
ALL WRING OUR HANDS, AND ARE

4108
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
VERY UPSET AND PEOPLE TRY AND

4109
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,000
THERE'S A RAGING DEBATE GOING

4110
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,000
ON.
AND THEN IT KIND OF GOES AWAY

4111
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
UNTIL THE NEXT ONE WHEN WE -- IT

4112
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
ALL COMES BACK AGAIN.

4113
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:57,000
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY OF
THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN,

4114
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:58,000
HONESTLY.

4115
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,000
IF HISTORY IS ANY JUDGE, IT'S

4116
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,000
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

4117
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,000
>> I REALLY THINK THAT THE

4118
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:02,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO GET

4119
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
INVOLVED IN THIS WHOLE GUN

4120
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
ACQUISITION ISSUE.

4121
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
IT SEEMS TO BE A FEDERAL ISSUE,

4122
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
BECAUSE IT'S A CONSTITUTIONAL

4123
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
ISSUE.

4124
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
IT'S A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THAT

4125
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
WE'VE DECIDED UPON.

4126
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
I THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD

4127
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
TAKE THE PURGATIVE OUT OF THE

4128
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
HANDS OF THE STATE AND MANDATE

4129
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL SCREENING FOR

4130
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
ANYONE THAT WANTS FIREARMS.

4131
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,000
ESPECIALLY THESE SPECIFIC TYPES

4132
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:26,000
OF HIGH-CAPACITY AUTOMATIC

4133
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,000
PISTOLS THAT WERE MAINLY

4134
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,000
PRODUCED FOR THE PURPOSE OF

4135
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
MILITARY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.

4136
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,000
AND IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU NEED

4137
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,000
AN ASSAULT RIFLE -- AND

4138
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
TRAGICALLY, EVEN THOUGH I DON'T

4139
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
NECESSARILY AGREE WITH IT, I

4140
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
UNDERSTAND WHERE PEOPLE OR HOW

4141
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
PEOPLE GET TO THAT THRESHOLD TO

4142
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
WHERE THEY DO THINK THEY NEED

4143
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
THESE WEAPONS.
JUST LOOK AT THE WORLD WE LIVE

4144
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:44,000
IN.

4145
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
THE TOPICS THAT WE'RE AS MUCH

4146
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,000
RATED WITH ON A DAILY BASIS

4147
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
THROUGH THE MEDIA.

4148
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,000
THREAT OF TERRORISM.

4149
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS.

4150
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:52,000
SHOOTINGS IN MALLS.

4151
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
SHOOTINGS IN MOVIE THEATRES.

4152
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:57,000
THIS STIMULATES OR TRIGGERS

4153
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
REACTIONS FROM PEOPLE.
>> YEP, YEP, YOU'RE RIGHT.

4154
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
>> AND LISTEN TO THIS ONE

4155
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
STATISTIC.

4156
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:06,000
44%, APPROXIMATELY, OF AFTER THE

4157
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
SHOOTING IN AURORA WENT OUT AND

4158
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:10,000
BOUGHT FIREARMS, BECAUSE THEIR

4159
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
PERCEPTION WAS THAT THIS IS A

4160
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
SOLUTION IN KEEPING THEMSELVES

4161
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:15,000
SAFE.
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS.

4162
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,000
BUT I THINK THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS

4163
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
TO WRAP THEIR ARMS AROUND THIS,

4164
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
AND SAY, LISTEN, WE'RE GOING

4165
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,000
APPROACH THIS INTELLIGENTLY.

4166
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,000
INSTEAD OF APPROACHING IT

4167
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
POLITICALLY.

4168
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
>> WELL, IT WILL BE INTERESTING.

4169
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS CALLED FOR

4170
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
SORT OF A RESPONSE BUT NO ONE IS

4171
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,000
EXACTLY SURE WHAT EXACTLY THAT

4172
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
DOES MEAN.

4173
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,000
LOU POLUMBO NOW RUNS A SECURITY

4174
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:36,000
ORGANIZATION.
THANKS, LOU, APPRECIATE IT.

4175
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
WANT TO GET BACK TO DEB FEYERICK

4176
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000

02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,000
DEB?
>> WE HAVE SOME NEW INFORMATION

4178
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
THAT'S COMING OUT OF THOSE WHO

4179
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
WERE KILLED IN THIS TRAGEDY.

4180
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:46,000
THE YOUNGEST WAS 6 YEARS OLD.

4181
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:49,000
THE OLDEST WAS 56.

4182
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:52,000
THAT'S ACCORDING TO INFORMATION
WE LEASED BY THE STATE POLICE.

4183
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
18 OF THE VICTIMS ARE DESCRIBED

02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,000
AS FEMALE.

4185
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
WE KNOW THERE WERE AT LEAST FOUR

4186
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,000
EDUCATORS.
THE PRINCIPAL, THE PSYCHOLOGIST,

4187
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
TWO TEACHERS THAT HAVE SO FAR

4188
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,000
BEEN IDENTIFIED.

4189
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000

ALLEGED GUNMAN.

4191

EIGHT OF THE VICTIMS WERE MALE.

4192
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LEARNING SO

4193
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,000
FAR.

4194
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
AND THE BODIES OF THE CHILDREN

4195
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,000

02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
THE FAMILIES TODAY.

4198
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:19,000

TOMORROW.

4202
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:24,000
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LEARNING SO
FAR.

4203
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
THE YOUNGEST, 6 YEARS OLD.

4204
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000

4205
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:33,000
MANY OF THE VICTIMS FIRST

4206
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:37,000
GRADERS.
>> DEB FEYERICK UPDATING US ON

4207
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
THE SCENE INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

4208
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
WE HEAR THEY HAVE FINISHED THIS

4209
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:42,000
AFTERNOON WITH THE POSTMORTEMS

4210
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,000
ON THE CHILDREN.

4211
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,000
AND THEY ARE EXPECTING -- AT

4212
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
LEAST ACCORDING TO THE MEDICAL

4213
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,000
EXAMINER, THAT THE POSTMORTEMS

4214
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
ON THE SHOOTER AND HIS MOTHER,

4215
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
THOSE SHOULD BE DONE SOMETIME

4216
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
TOMORROW MORNING.
WE KNOW THAT, IN FACT,

4217
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,000
INVESTIGATORS WILL BE LOOKING AT

4218
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FOR

4219
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,000
AT LEAST ANOTHER DAY OR MAYBE

4220
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,000
EVEN TWO DAYS.

4221
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:58,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER

4222
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:01,000
REALLY WHAT IS A HORRIFIC

4223
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:02,000
PUZZLE.
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED AND WHY

4224
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
DID IT HAPPEN, TO GIVE US A

4225
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW IT

4226
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
WENT DOWN ON FRIDAY.

4227
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
LET'S GET TO CNN'S JOSH LEVS.

4228
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
HE'S GOT A VIRTUAL LOOK AT THIS

4229
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:12,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

4230
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,000
JOSH?

4231
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
>> YEAH, HI AGAIN.

4232
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:16,000
THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION

4233
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,000
ABOUT THIS HORROR TODAY,

4234
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:20,000
BOMBARDING YOU.

4235
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,000
IT CAN BE A LOT.

4236
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
I WANT TO TELL YOU, THERE ARE A

4237
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
FEW VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I

4238
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:26,000
CAN DRILL DOWN FOR YOU THAT WILL

4239
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
NOT ONLY HELP SHOW WHAT YOU

4240
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
INVESTIGATORS NEED TO LEARN
HERE, BUT WILL ALSO POTENTIALLY

4241
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,000
HAVE REPERCUSSIONS FOR SCHOOLS

4242
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
AROUND THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF

4243
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
SECURITY SYSTEMS.
LET'S ZOOM INTO THIS MAP SO

4244
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,000
YOU'RE SEEING IT MORE CLOSELY.

4245
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:40,000
THIS SAY 3-D LOOK AT THIS SCHOOL

4246
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
ITSELF.
IT HAS 600 STUDENTS TOTAL AND IT

4247
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
HAS ABOUT 50 MEMBERS OF THE

4248
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
FACULTY.
NOW, AUTHORITIES HAVE TOLD US,

4249
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:49,000
HAVE SAID THAT THIS ENTIRE THING

4250
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
IS NOW A CRIME SCENE.

4251
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,000
THEY SAID THEY'RE SCOURING THE

4252
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:53,000
ENTIRE BUILDING RIGHT HERE, AND

4253
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
IN THE WORDS OF POLICE, EACH AND

4254
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
EVERY CAR IS BEING INVESTIGATED,

4255
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:58,000
AS WELL.
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

4256
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,000
THEY'RE LOOKG FOR.

4257
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,000
BUT I WANT TO TRACE YOU THROUGH

4258
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
A FEW STEPS HERE.

4259
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
WE NOW KNOW THAT THE DAY BEFORE

4260
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,000
THIS HAPPENED, THIS GUNMAN WENT

4261
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
TO THAT SCHOOL, HAD AN

4262
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
ALTERCATION WITH FOUR ADULTS.

4263
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
THE NEXT DAY, CAME BACK, KILLED

4264
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:12,000
THREE OF THEM.

4265
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:13,000
THAT'S ACCORDING TO A LAW

4266
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:14,000
ENFORCEMENT SOURCE WITH

4267
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,000
KNOWLEDGE OF THE INVESTIGATION.

4268
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,000
SO EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED THERE,

4269
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
WHETHER IT COULD HAVE PRESENTED

4270
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,000
ANY WARNING SIGN, VERY

4271
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,000
IMPORTANT.

4272
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,000
NEXT THING FOR YOU TO KNOW,

4273
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
POLICE HAVE SAID TODAY THAT THEY

4274
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:26,000
BELIEVE THEY GOT THE FIRST 911

4275
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,000
CALL AROUND 9:30 A.M.

4276
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
NOW, EACH MINUTE, EACH FRACTION

4277
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
OF A MINUTE IN A CASE LIKE THIS

4278
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,000
IS VERY IMPORTANT.
AND HERE'S WHY.

4279
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:33,000
AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, THE

4280
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
SECURITY SYSTEM AT THIS SCHOOL

4281
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
INVOLVING LOCKING DOWN OF DOORS

4282
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
GETS TURNED ON AT 9:30 A.M.

4283
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:40,000
SO WAS THIS SHOOTER IN THERE

4284
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
BEFORE OR AFTER THAT SECURITY

4285
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
SYSTEM WAS TURNED ON?

4286
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
WELL, THE AUTHORITIES SAY HE DID

4287
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
HAVE TO BREAK HIS WAY IN.

4288
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:48,000
SO HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

4289
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,000
IF THE SECURITY SYSTEM IS ON,

4290
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:52,000
HOW DOES A PERSON WITH MULTIPLE

4291
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
GUNS BREAK HIS WAY INTO A SCHOOL

4292
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,000
WITHOUT ANYONE NOTICING OR

4293
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
POTENTIALLY SETTING OFF AN

4294
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:58,000
ALARM?
KEY QUESTION RIGHT THERE.

4295
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,000
NEXT THING FOR YOU TO KNOW.

4296
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
THERE ARE SOME SHATTERED WINDOWS

4297
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,000
AROUND THIS SCHOOL, WHICH MIGHT

4298
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
HAVE GUY YOU AN ANSWER TO THE

4299
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
PREVIOUS QUESTION.
BUT POLICE SAID NOT SO FAST.

4300
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:07,000
WHEN AUTHORITIES WERE CALLED TO

4301
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
THE SCHOOL YESTERDAY, THEY

4302
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
NEEDED TO BURST THEIR WAY IN

4303
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,000
MULTIPLE UNITS.

4304
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
AND THAT COULD BE QUITE POSSIBLY

4305
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,000
IS THE REASON THAT WINDOWS HAVE

4306
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
BEEN BURST OPEN.

4307
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,000
SO WHERE EXACTLY -- LET'S ZOOM

4308
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:19,000
IN ONE MORE TIME.

4309
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
WHERE EXACTLY WAS THE GUNMAN IN

4310
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
THIS PARKING LOT OR AROUND THE

4311
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,000
SCHOOL, IN ADVANCE, AS PEOPLE

4312
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
WERE COMING IN?

4313
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:27,000
HOW EARLY DID HE GET THERE?

4314
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:28,000
WHAT TIME DID HE PHYSICALLY

4315
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,000
ENTER THE BUILDING WITH RESPECT

4316
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
TO WHEN THAT SECURITY SYSTEM WAS

4317
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,000
TURNED ON?

4318
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,000
AND HOW DID HE DO IT?

4319
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
ALL OF THESE ARE NEW CENTRAL

4320
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TIME LINE OF

4321
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
WHAT HAS HAPPENED, BASED ON WHAT

4322
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,000
THE AUTHORITIES ARE TELLING US

4323
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,000
TODAY.

4324
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,000
>> NOW, WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE

4325
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:42,000
SHOOTING ITSELF TOOK PLACE IN

4326
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
ONE CORNER OF THE SCHOOL, ONE

4327
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:45,000
GENERAL AREA OF THE SCHOOL.

4328
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER

4329
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,000
EVIDENCE THEY MIGHT FIND IN ALL

4330
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,000
OF THE CARS AND THROUGHOUT THE

4331
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
PARKING LOT, THROUGHOUT THE

4332
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
BUILDING.
WE DO KNOW THEY'RE SCOURING IT

4333
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
FOR ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING.

4334
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,000
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KEY

4335
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:56,000
QUESTIONS WE'RE LOOKING FOR

4336
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,000
ANSWERS TO RIGHT NOW.

4337
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

4338
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

4339
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,000
ONE THING I'M GOING TO TELL YOU,

4340
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,000
WHERE THERE IS CONFLICTING

4341
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:04,000
INFORMATION TO THAT, JOSH, WHEN

4342
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
WE HEARD OUR FINAL PRESS

4343
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
CONFERENCE, THERE WAS NO

4344
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
INFORMATION, WE WERE TOLD BY THE
STATE POLICE, ABOUT A

4345
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,000
CONFRONTATION.

4346
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,000
SO WE HAVE NOW HEARD BOTH

4347
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,000
VERSIONS OF THAT.

4348
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
SOME SAYING THERE WAS AN

4349
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
ALTERCATION OR THERE WAS NO

4350
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
CONFRONTATION.

4351
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,000
OF THE QUESTIONS THEY'RE HOPING

4352

4353
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:22,000

ONE THING THEY HAVE TOLD US IN

4421

THE LAST HOUR, THERE WAS NO

4422

CONFRONTATION.

4423
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
THERE WAS SOME WORD THAT IN FACT
THE ALLEGED SHOOTER, ADAM LANZA,

4424
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
HAD HAD A CONFRONTATION AT THE

4425

SCHOOL IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE

4426
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:02,000
SHOOTING, AND THAT SOMEHOW THAT

4427
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:05,000
WOULD BE LINKED TO THIS

4428
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:06,000
SHOOTING.

4429
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
WE WERE TOLD IN FACT BY A

4430
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:08,000
LIEUTENANT VANCE WITH THE STATE

4431
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000

ABOUT ANY CONFRONTATION THAT WAS

4433
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
IN A PRESS CONFERENCE HE WRAPPED

4434
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
UP ROUGHLY 40 MINUTES AGO OR SO.

4435
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000

4438
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:22,000
UP TO SIX GUNS INVOLVED.

4439
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000

GUNS NEAR LANZA'S BODY IN A

4444

4447
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:39,000
WAS ALSO FOUND DEAD IN HER HOME.

4448
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:40,000
INVESTIGATORS RECOVERED THREE

4449
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,000
OTHER RIFLES.

4450
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,000
IT'S UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT

4451
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:43,000
EXACTLY WHERE THOSE WEAPONS WERE
FOUND.

4452
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:47,000
WE WANT TO GET TO MIKE BOOSHARD,

4453

FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR.

4454
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:53,000
MIKE, WE KNOW YOU SUPERVISED THE

4455
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:56,000
ATF'S RESPONSE A DECADE AGO, A

4456
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:57,000
STORY I COVERED A LOT, THE

4457
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:58,000
WASHINGTON, D.C. BELTWAY SNIPER.

4458
02:27:58,000 --> 02:27:59,000
SO UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS

4459
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
SOMETHING YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT.

4460
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
I WANT YOU TO WALK ME THROUGH

4461
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:07,000
SOME OF THESE WEAPONS.

4462
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:08,000
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, THE

4463
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER SAID THAT

4464
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
EVERYBODY WAS SHOT WITH THE SAME

4465
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:13,000
RIFLE.

4466
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:14,000
WHICH WOULD BE I GUESS THE

4467
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,000
BUSHMASTER.

4468
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,000
SO GIVE US SOME MORE INFORMATION

4469
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:21,000
ABOUT THE BUSHMASTER . 223

4470
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE.

4471
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,000
THAT CERTAINLY CHANGES THE FACTS

4472
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:24,000
IN THIS CASE.

4473
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,000
OBVIOUSLY, THE BUSHMASTER IS

4474
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
TYPICALLY USED IN A LONGER-RANGE

4475
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:28,000
SHOOTING.

4476
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:29,000
IT HAS MORE ACCURACY FROM A

4477
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
DISTANCE.
IT'S ODD THAT HE WOULD TAKE THE

4478
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
LONG GUN INTO THE SCHOOL,

4479
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
BECAUSE HE COULD DO JUST AS MUCH

4480
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
DAMAGE WITH THE PISTOLS.

4481
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
THE ONE ADVANTAGE WITH THE RIFLE

4482
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:41,000
IS TYPICALLY YOU CAN LOAD

4483
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:42,000
30-ROUND MAGAZINES TYPICALLY

4484
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
DURING SOME OF THESE TACTICAL

4485
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:45,000
SITUATIONS.

4486
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:46,000
THEY'LL STACK THE TWO MAGAZINES,

4487
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:49,000
ONE UPSIDE DOWN, FINISH SHOOTING

4488
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
30 ROUNDS, PUSH A BUTTON, FLIP

4489
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,000
THE OTHER ONE OVER AS QUICKLY AS

4490
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
YOU CAN TURN IT, AND NOW YOU

4491
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
HAVE ANOTHER 30 ROUNDS TO SHOOT.

4492
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:00,000
SO THE TACTICS -- WHAT'S ODD

4493
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,000
WITH THIS WHOLE THING THAT I

4494
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:02,000
FIND ODD, WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE

4495
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE AND THE GUN

4496
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
ISSUE.
IT'S REALLY A TRIAD.

4497
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
WHY ARE THESE YOUNG MALES --

4498
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
WHERE ARE THEY LEARNING THESE

4499
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:11,000
TACTICS, WHERE ARE THEY LEARNING

4500
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:12,000
TO DRESS?

4501
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,000
WHERE ARE THEY LEARNING THE

4502
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:14,000
RELOADING TACTICS?

4503
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,000
HOW ARE THEY LEARNING TO BRING

4504
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
THESE TYPE OF WEAPONS AND DO

4505
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
THESE PREPLANNED ATTACKS?

4506
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
AND MANY OF THEM ARE LEARNING

4507
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
FROM VIDEO GAMES OR MOVIES AND

4508
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT NEEDS TO

4509
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION,

4510
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
BECAUSE SOMEBODY WHO IS MENTALLY

4511
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:30,000
UNSTABLE ISN'T NECESSARILY GOING

4512
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:31,000
TO KILL SOMEONE.

4513
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
SOMEBODY WHO OWNS A GUN ISN'T

4514
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:34,000
NECESSARILY GOING TO KILL

4515
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:35,000
SOMEONE.
BUT WHEN YOU PUT THESE THREE

4516
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
THINGS TOGETHER, IT CAN BE A

4517
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:38,000
RECIPE FOR DISASTER.

4518
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:39,000
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE

4519
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:40,000
RIGHT.

4520
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:41,000
AND I THINK OUR CULTURE IS

4521
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
VERY -- IS VERY CONTRADICTORY,

4522
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:46,000
RIGHT, ON ONE HAND WE DID HE CRY

4523
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:49,000
VIOLENCE AND YET OUR MOVIES ARE

4524
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:52,000
SO VIOLENT.
WE TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH, BUT

4525
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,000
DON'T NECESSARILY FINANCIALLY

4526
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:54,000
SUPPORT IT.

4527
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:55,000
WE TALK ABOUT GUNS AND THE

4528
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:56,000
AFTERMATH OF EVENTS LIKE THIS,

4529
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:57,000
BUT WE DON'T ACTUALLY DO

4530
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:58,000
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

4531
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:01,000
SO I THINK YOU'RE
