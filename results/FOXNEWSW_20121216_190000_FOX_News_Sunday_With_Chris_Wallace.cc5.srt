IN THE FIRST GRADE.

284
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE

285
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
GUNMAN BURST INTO HIS

286
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
CLASSROOM AND WAS CON FRONTED

287
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
TEACHER.

289
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
WE WILL TALK ABOUT HER IN A

290
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
MINUTE.

291
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
VICTORIA SOTO.
WHAT DID ADEN DO AFTER THAT.

292
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
>> WE'RE FINDING OUT MORE AND

THE CHILDREN ACTED ON INSTINCT

300
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
AND WHAT THEY WERE TAUGHT,

301
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
WHICH WAS TO RUN.

302
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000

303
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
THEY JUST RAN UP TO THE MAIN

ROAD 100 YARDS AWAY.

305
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
MY SON AND SEVERAL OF HIS

306
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
OTHER STUDENTS WERE EXTREMELY

307
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
BRAVE IN WHAT THEY DID AND

308
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
ACTED WITH COURAGE THAT I

309
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE.

310
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
AND AGAIN, THEY JUST RAN AND

311
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO MEET

312
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
A WOMAN WHO WAS -- IS ANOTHER

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT ADEN NOT

317
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
ONLY WAITED FOR ADEN TO MAKE

318
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000

NOT TO SHOOT AND PUT HERSELF

324
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
IN FRONT OF THE GUNMAN AND

325
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
LOST HER LIFE TRYING TO SAVE

326
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000

>> ROBERT, YOU KNOW, ADEN

377
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
KNOWS SOME OF THE FAMILIES WHO

378
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
LOST CHILDREN IN THIS.

379
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
SOME OF THEM WERE HIS

380
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
CLASSMATES.
FIRST GRADE CLASS OF VICTORIA

381
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
SOCIETY TO.

382
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
IN THIS SENSE IS THAT BITTER

383
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
SWEET THAT YOU HAVE ADEB AND

384
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
OLDER DAUGHTER ALSO AT THE

385
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
SCHOOL KALINE AND SOME OF YOUR

386
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
NEIGHBORS DON'T?

387
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
>> YEAH.

388
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
IT'S A SMALL COMMUNITY.

389
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
RIGHT?

390
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
SO, ALL OF THE CHILDREN KNOW

391
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
EACH OTHER FROM PRESCHOOL.

392
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
THEY GO TO CHURCH TOGETHER.

393
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
THEY HAVE PLAY DATES TOGETHER.

394
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
WENER THOUGHT HE WAS GONE BUT

395
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
HE COULD HAVE VERY WELL BEEN

396
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
ONE OF THOSE THAT WERE

397
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
AFFECTED.
WE FEEL VERY BLESSED.

398
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
AND IT IS BITTERSWEET BECAUSE

399
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
WE DO, WHILE WE FEEL BLESSED

400
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
THAT WE STILL HAVE OUR SON AND

401
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
OUR DAUGHTER, WE MOURN FOR OUR

402
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS WHO

403
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
WEREN'T AS FORTUNATE AND LOST

404
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
THEIR CHILDREN.

405
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
>> Chris: LYNN, FINALLY I

406
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
GUESS THIS IS THE HARDEST

407
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
QUESTION, HOW DO YOU MAKE

408
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
SENSE OF THIS?

409
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
THERE IS NO SENSE.

410
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE

411
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
TO THIS I THINK I'M STILL VERY

412
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
NUMB.

413
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
LIKE ROBERT SAID WE ARE

414
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
HOW MANY FAMILIES AND FRIENDS

418
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
DIDN'T GO HOME WITH THEIR

419
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
CHILDREN FRIDAY NIGHT.

420
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
IT'S JUST VERY VERY HEART

421
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
WRENCHING AND THERE IS NO --

422
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
THERE IS NO WAY TO MAKE ANY

423
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
SENSE OF ANYTHING WHAT THIS

424
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
PERSON HAS DONE.
NOT ONLY TO FAMILIES BUT TO A

425
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
COMMUNITY, TO A NATION, AND

426
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
IT'S JUST UNFATHOMABLE.

427
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
YOU JUST DON'T.

428
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000

454
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
CONNECTICUT HISTORY SECOND

455
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
WORST EVER IN THIS COUNTRY.

456
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
COLD NUMBERS ONLY MAGNIFY THE

457
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
FACT THAT THE SO MANY OF THE

458
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
VICTIMS WERE SMALL CHILDREN.

459
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
JOINING US NOW IS JOE

460
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
LIEBERMAN WHO HAS REPRESENTED

461
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
CONNECTICUT FOR 24 YEARS.

462
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN ON

463
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
THIS DIFFICULT WEEKEND.

464
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
>> THANK YOU, CHRIS.

465
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
>> Chris: WHAT DO WE DO?

466
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
>> YOU KNOW AS LYNN SAID,

467
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
THERE IS NO ANSWER, I MEAN,

468
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
THIS IS EVIL.

469
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS MANY

470
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
TIMES.
I THINK WE NEED A NATIONAL

471
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
COMMISSION ON MASS VIOLENCE.

472
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
NOT TO BE IN PLACE OF ANYTHING

473
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
ELSE THE PRESIDENT OR CONGRESS

474
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
OR STATE GOVERNMENTS MIGHT

475
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
WANT TO DO BUT TO MAKE SURE

476
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
THAT HEART BREAK AND THE ANGER

477
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
THAT WE FEEL NOW IS NOT

478
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
DISSIPATED OVER TIME OR LOST

479
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
IN LEGISLATIVE GRIDLOCK.

480
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU, THIS

481
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
REMINDS ME OF THE DAYS AND

482
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
WEEKS AFTER THE TERRORIST

483
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
ATTACKS AGAINST US OF 9/11.

484
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
AND AT ONE POINT, JOHN MCCAIN

485
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
AND I TURNED TO EACH OTHER AND

486
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
SAID WE CAN'T LET THIS JUST

487
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
GO.

488
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
WE HAVE GOT TO CREATE A

489
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
NATIONAL COMMISSION TO

490
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
INVESTIGATE EXACTLY THE

491
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
QUESTIONS WE ARE ASKING ABOUT

492
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
NEW TOWN.

493
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED

494
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
AND IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN

495
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
DO TO TRY TO PREVENT IT FROM

496
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
HAPPENING AGAIN.

497
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
>> THERE WERE FORUMS AFTER

498
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
9/11 AND AFTER THE COMMISSION

499
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
AND THE WAY THAT THE

500
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND THE

501
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
FBI SHARED INFORMATION.

502
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
IT WASN'T JUST LET'S WALLOW IN

503
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
OUR GRIEF.

504
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
>> NO.

505
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
>> Chris: LET ME ASK YOU A
SPECIFIC QUESTION.

506
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
>> I WANT TO SAY VERY QUICKLY

507
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I

508
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN.

509
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I DON'T WANT US TO WALLOW IN

510
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
OUR GRIEF.
I WANT US TO ASK WHAT CAN WE

511
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
DO AS A SOCIETY TO MAKE SURE

512
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
YOUNG MEMBER LIKE ADAM LANZA

513
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
GET HELP BEFORE THEY BECOME

514
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
SHOOTERS AND KILLERS.

515
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
WHAT'S THE ROLE OF VIOLENCE IN

516
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
OUR ENTERTAINMENT CULTURE
TODAY IT IN STIMULATING A

517
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
VULNERABLE KID LIKE THIS?

518
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
AND WHAT MORE CAN WE DO TO

519
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
KEEP DANGEROUS WEAPONS OUT OF

520
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
THE HANDS OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS?

521
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
>> Chris: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT

522
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
SOME OF THOSE SPECIFIC

523
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
QUESTIONS.
BACK IN THE 90'S YOU SUPPORTED

524
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
THE BREATED LAW WHICH CALLED

525
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
FOR A FIVE DAY WAITING PERIOD.

526
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
>> RIGHT.

527
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
>> Chris: YOU AASSAULT WEAPONS

528
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
BAN.
YOU AND AL GORE CAMPAIGNED

529
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
AROUND THE COUNTRY AND YOU

530
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
LOST AND A LOT OF PEOPLE TOOK

531
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
AS A LESSEN PART OF IT WAS IN

532
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
STATES LIKE TENNESSEE AND WEST

533
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
VIRGINIA THE FACT THAT YOU

534
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
WERE PROGUN CONTROL AND QUITE

535
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
FRANKLY EVER SINCE DEMOCRATS

536
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
HAVE BEEN SCARED OF TOUCHING

537
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
THAT ISSUE.

538
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
IS IT FULL-TIME FOR DEMOCRATS

539
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
TO PUSH FOR STRICTER GUN

540
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
CONTROL?

541
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
>> IT'S TIME FOR DEMOCRATS,

542
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS

543
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
TO SAY -- ACKNOWLEDGE TWO

544
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
THINGS.

545
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
ONE IS THE STRONGEST

546
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
CONCEIVABLE GUN CONTROL LAWS

547
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
WON'T STOP ALL ACTS OF

548
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
VIOLENCE.

549
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
BUT ALSO, TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

550
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
THE STRONGER OUR GUN CONTROL

551
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
LAWS ARE, THE FEWER ACTS OF

552
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
VIOLENCE, INCLUDING MASS

553
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
VIOLENCE THAT WILL HAPPEN ON

554
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
OUR SOCIETY.
SO, AS A RESULT OF THE BRADY

555
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
LAW, AND IT STILL EXISTS.

556
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
IF YOU GO IT NOAH A LICENSED

557
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
FIREARM DEALER YOU HAVE A

558
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
BACKGROUND CHECK AND IT'S A

559
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
THOROUGH ONE.

560
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
IF YOU BUY A GUN FROM SOMEBODY

561
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
WHO IS NOT LICENSED OR AT A

562
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
GUN SHOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE

563
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
CHECKED AT ALL.
THAT'S A LOOPHOLE THAT WE

564
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
OUGHT TO CLOSE.

565
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS, THESE WERE

566
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
DEVELOPED BY THE U.S. MILITARY

567
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
ORIGINALLY AS WEAPONS OF WAR.

568
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO

569
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
RESTORE THAT ASSAULT WEAPONS

570
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
BAN BECAUSE NOT TO TAKE

571
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
ANYBODY'S GUNS AWAY FROM THEM

572
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
THAT THEY HAVE NOW.
BUT IT TO STOP THE MANUFACTURE

573
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
AND SALE OF THOSE WEAPONS NOW

574
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
BECAUSE LOOK WHAT LANZA DID TO

575
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
THESE POOR KIDS.

576
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT A COUPLE

577
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
OF OTHER THINGS.

578
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
MENTAL ILLNESS.

579
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
>> YEAH.

580
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
>> THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A

581
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
DISTURBED BOY.

582
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
>> CORRECT.
>> SOME OTHER CASES HOLMES IN

583
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
AURORA DISTURBED.

584
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY

585
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
THERE IS SOME STATISTICS ABOUT

586
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
KIDS WILL HAVE WATCHED

587
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
THOUSANDS OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE

588
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
ON VIDEOS, ON GAMES AND MOVIES

589
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
AND TV BY THE TIME, YOU KNOW,

590
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
THEY ARE 10.

591
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
SPECIFICALLY, WHAT KIND OF

592
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
THING CAN WE DO ABOUT THAT?

593
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
>> THAT'S WHY I THINK WE NEED

594
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
A NATIONAL COMMISSION.

595
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I WILL TELL YOU I SPENT ENOUGH

596
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
TIME ON THIS QUESTION OF

597
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
VIOLENCE IN THE ENTERTAINMENT

598
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
CULTURE TO REACH THIS

599
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
CONCLUSION.

600
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
THAT THE VIOLENCE IN THE

601
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
ENTERTAINMENT CULTURE

602
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
PARTICULARLY WITH THE
EXTRAORDINARY REALISM TO VIDEO

603
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
GAME MOVIES ET CETERA DOES

604
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
CAUSE VULNERABLE YOUNG MEN,

605
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
PARTICULARLY TO BEING MORE

606
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
VIOLENT IT.
DOESN'T MAKE EVERYBODY MORE

607
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
VIOLENT BUT IT'S A CAUSATIVE

608
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
FACTOR IN SOME CASES.

609
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
WE HAVE GOT TO ASK THE

610
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY WHAT

611
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
ARE TONE IT DOWN.

612
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
>> Chris: PASS A LAW.

613
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
>> IN OUR SOCIETY YOU TRY TO

614
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
DO IT VOLUNTARILY, YOU HAVE

615
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
COME TO A POINT TO SAY IF NOT

616
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
MAYBE THERE IS SOME THINGS WE

617
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
CAN DO TO TONE IT DOWN.

618
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
THERE IS A BETTER RATING

619
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
SYSTEM NOW THAN THERE USED TO

620
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
BE ON VIDEO GAMES AND VIOLENT

621
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
MOVIES.
THEY ARE STILL OUT THERE.

622
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MENTAL

623
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
HEALTH SYSTEM.
I THINK WE HAVE REALLY GOT TO

624
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
ASK OURSELVES FIRST OFF THIS

625
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
IS LIKE THE SLOGAN THAT WE USE

626
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
IN HOMELAND SECURITY.

627
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.

628
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
WE HAVE GOT TO ASK PARENTS,

629
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
FRIENDS, SCHOOL OFFICIALS IF

630
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
YOU SEE A CHILD, A YOUNG

631
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
PERSON THAT REALLY LOOKS LIKE

632
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
THEY ARE POTENTIALLY REALLY

633
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
TROUBLESOME, GET THEM MENTAL

634
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
HELP.

635
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
AND THEN WE HAVE GOT TO ASK

636
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
OURSELVES AS A SOCIETY, IS

637
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
THERE ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH

638
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
HELP AVAILABLE FOR THESE KIDS?

639
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
THERE IS IS NO CURE.

640
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
VIOLENCE IS AS OLD AS CAIN

641
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
KILLING HIS BROTHER ABLE.

642
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
BUT GOD DIDN'T ACCEPT THAT AS

643
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
A GIVEN AND SAID IF I MAY TO

644
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
CAIN, WHERE IS YOUR BROTHER?

645
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
AND ABLE, CAIN SAYS AM I MY

646
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
BROTHER'S KEEPER?

647
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
AND GOD SAYS ESSENTIALLY YES.

648
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I HEAR YOUR BROTHER'S BLOOD

649
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
CRYING OUT TO ME FROM THE

650
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
GROUND.
AND I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO

651
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
CONTINUE TO HEAR THE SCREAMS

652
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
OF THESE CHILDREN AND SEE

653
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
THEIR BLOOD UNTIL WE DO

654
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
SOMETHING TO TRY TO PREVENT

655
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

656
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
VIGIL TONIGHT.

657
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
THANK YOU, SIR EVERYWHERE.

658
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
>> Chris: UP NEXT, WITH

659
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
ANOTHER MASS MURDER, NEW CALLS

660
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
FOR GUN CONTROL IS NOW THE

661
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
RIGHT TIME?

662
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
AS OUR COVERAGE OF THE SCHOOL

663
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
TRAGEDY IN CONNECTICUT

664
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
CONTINUES.

665
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
[ Male Announcer ]
IT'S SIMPLE PHYSICS...

666
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
A BODY AT REST
TENDS TO STAY AT REST...

667
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
WHILE A BODY IN MOTION
TENDS TO STAY IN MOTION.

668
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
STAYING ACTIVE CAN ACTUALLY
EASE ARTHRITIS SYMPTO.

669
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
BUT IF YOU HAVE ARTHRITIS,

670
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
STAYING ACTIVE
CAN BE DIFFICULT.

671
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
PRESCRIPTION CELEBREX
CAN HELP RELIEVE ARTHRITIS PAIN

672
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
SO YOUR BODY
CAN STAY IN MOTION.

673
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
BECAUSE JUST ONE
200MG CELEBREX A DAY

674
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
CAN PROVIDE 24 HOUR RELIEF

675
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
FOR MANY WITH ARTHRITIS PAIN
AND INFLAMMATION.

676
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
PLUS, IN CLINICAL STUDIES,

677
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
CELEBREX IS PROVEN TO IMPROVE
DAILY PHYSICAL FUNCTION

678
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
SO MOVING IS EASIER.

679
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
CELEBREX CAN BE TAKEN WITH
OR WITHOUT FOOD.

680
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
AND IT'S NOT A NARCOTIC.

681
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000

682
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000

HAVE THE SAME
CARDIOVASCULAR WARNING.

684
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
THEY ALL MAY INCREASE
THE CHANCE

685
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
OF HEART ATTACK OR STROKE,
WHICH CAN LEAD TO DEATH.

686
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
THIS CHANCE INCREASES
IF YOU HAVE HEART DISEASE

687
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
RISK FACTORS
SUH AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE

688
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
OR WHEN NSAIDS ARE TAKEN
FOR LONG PERIODS.

689
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
NSAIDS, INCLUDING CELEBREX,

690
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
INCREASE THE CHANCE OF SERIOUS

WHICH CAN OCCUR WITHOUT WARNING
AND MAY CAUSE DEATH.

PATIENTS ALSO TAKING ASPIRIN
AND THE ELDEY

695
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
ARE AT INCRSED RISK FOR
STOCH BLEEDING AND ULCERS.

696
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
DO NOT TAKE CELEBREX IF YOU'VE
HAD AN ASTHMA ATTACK, HIVES,

697

SUGGESTING IS NOW TIME TO

705
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
REOPEN THE NATIONAL DEBATE ON

706
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
GUN CONTROL.
AS HORRIFIC AS THIS SHOOTING

707
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
HAS BEEN WE HAVE WITHIN HERE

708
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
BEFORE AS A NATION.

709
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE INTEREST

710
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
IN THE LAST DECADE IN

711
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
TIGHTENING GUN LAWS.

JOINING ME NOW IS DICK DURBIN

713
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
IN HIS HOME STATE OF ILLINOIS.

714
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
SENATOR, HOW DO YOU READ THE

715
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS THAT WE

716
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
JUST PLAYED?
IS IT TIME FOR A NEW PUSH,

717
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
TIGHTER GUN CONTROL?

718
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
>> WELL, FIRST, LET ME SAY THE

719
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
NATION IS IN MOURNING AND

720
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
REFLECTION AND PRAYER OVER

721
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN NEWTOWN,

722
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
CONNECTICUT THERE ISN'T A

723
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
PARENT OR GRANDPARENT THAT

724
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
DIDN'T VISUALIZE SOME SOMEONE

725
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
THEY LOVE SUBJECTED TO THIS
KIND OF VIOLENCE WHY NEED A

726
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
NATIONAL CONVERSATION OF THE

727
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
JOE LIEBERMAN CALLED.

728
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
WE NEED A NATIONAL

729
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
CONVERSATION ABOUT SAFETY.
I WOULD GO BEYOND JOE AND SAY

730
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
LET'S ADD THAT ISSUE OF SCHOOL

731
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
SAFETY INTO THIS CONVERSATION

732
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
AS WELL.

733
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
GUN CONTROL IS PART OF IT WE

734
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
NEED TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A

735
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
QUIET CALM REFLECTION ON THE

736
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
SECOND AMENDMENT?
ARE THERE GUNS THAT SHOULDN'T

737
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
BE SOLD ACROSS AMERICA.

738
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
MILITARY ASSAULT WEAPONS SUCH

739
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
AS THE ONE INVOLVED IN THIS

740
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
HORRIFIC INCIDENT N

741
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
CONNECTICUT?
ARE THERE HIGH AM MISSION

742
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
CLIPS?
HIGH CLIPS THAT HAVE NO VALUE

743
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
WHATSOEVER WHEN IT COMES TO

744
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
SPORTING AND HUNTING AND EVEN

745
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
SELF-DEFENSE.

746
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
THAT A PERSON COULD BUY BODY

747
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
ARMOR, TAKE THAT BODY ARMOR

748
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
AND USE IT TO PROTECT

749
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
THEMSELVES AS THEY KILL

750
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
INNOCENT PEOPLE?

751
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
CAN WE HAVE A THOUGHTFUL, CALM

752
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
REFLECTION ON THESE THINGS DO

753
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
IT IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR

754
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
SECOND AMENDMENT?

755
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I THINK WE NEED TO.

756
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
>> Chris: THE PRESIDENT AS WE

757
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
HAD IN THAT CLIP MENTIONED

758
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
REGARDLESS OF POLITICS AND THE

759
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
FACT IS THAT WE HAD THAT

760
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
SLAUGHTER OF PEOPLE AT THE

761
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
MOVIE THEATER IN AURORA,

762
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
COLORADO JUST IN JULY AT THAT

763
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
TIME YOU SAID YOU SUPPORTED A

764
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS.

765
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
YOU ALSO SAID.

766
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
>> I DO.

767
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
>> Chris: BACK AT THAT TIME

768
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
THERE IS ZERO CHANCE THAT

769
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
CONGRESS WILL PASS THAT.

770
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
IT'S NOT JUST REPUBLICANS,

771
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
QUITE FRANKLY AS I POINTED OUT

772
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
TO JOE LIEBERMAN YOUR PARTY

773
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
HAS BEEN AFRAID BECAUSE OF

774
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
POLITICS TO PUSH THIS FOR THE

775
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
LAST DECADE.

776
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
CHRIS, THERE IS PLENTY OF

777
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
BLAME ON BOTH SIDES

778
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
POLITICALLY.

779
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
THERE IS ALSO A RESPONSIBILITY
OF THE PEOPLE ACROSS THIS

780
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
NATION I WOULD APPEAL TO THE

781
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
HUNTERS AND SPORTSMEN I KNOW

782
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
THEM.
THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE.

783
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
THEY LOVE THEIR FAMILIES.

784
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
THEY HEAR WHAT THEY ARE
HEARING ABOUT NEW TOWN,

785
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
CONNECTICUT BUT THEY HAVE BEEN

786
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
LARGELY QUIET.

787
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
THIS CONVERSATION HAS BEEN

788
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
DOMINATED IN WASHINGTON BY,

789
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
YOU KNOW AND I KNOW, GUN

790
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
LOBBIES THAT HAVE AN AGENDA.

791
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
WE NEED FOR HERMINE, JUST

792
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
ORDINARY AMERICANS TO COME
TOGETHER AND SPEAK OUT AND TO

793
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
SIT DOWN AND CALMLY REFLECT ON

794
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
HOW FAR WE GO.

795
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'M GOING TO BE HOLDING A

796
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
HEARING AFTER THE THE

797
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
YEAR IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS OR SO

798
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
ON THIS CONSTITUTIONAL

799
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
QUESTION.
THAT'S THE STARTING POINT.

800
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
THE SUPREME COURT RAISED

801
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SECOND

802
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
AMENDMENT, WHAT ARE THE

803
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
PROTECTIONS?

804
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
WHAT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITIES?

805
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
LET'S SPELL THIS OUT?

806
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
AND LET'S TRY TO DO IT IN A

807
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
THOUGHTFUL WAY AND MOVE

808
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
FORWARD TOGETHER.
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED.

809
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
>> Chris: LET'S DEAL WITH SOME

810
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST NEW GUN

811
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
LAWS.
THE FACT IS THAT CONNECTICUT

812
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
SENATOR AS YOU PELL KNOW HAS

813
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
SOME OF THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS

814
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
IN THE COUNTRY.

815
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
NANCY LANZA, THE MOTHER OF THE

816
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
SHOOTER HAD BOUGHT AND

817
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
REGISTERED THESE GUNS LEGALLY.

818
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
WHAT MORE CAN WE DO?

819
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
>> WELL, LISTEN, WHY IN THE

820
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
WORLD WOULD ANYONE, EVEN NANCY

821
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
LANZA NEED A MILITARY ASSAULT

822
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
WEAPON DESIGNED FOR THE

823
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
MILITARY THAT HAS THE CAPACITY

824
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
TO FIRE OFF HUNDREDS OF

825
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
ROUNDS?

826
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
HEART BREAKING TO HEAR THIS

827
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
CORONER SPEAK ABOUT THESE POOR

828
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
LITTLE KIDS WHOSE BODIES WERE

829
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
RIDDLED WITH BULLETS FOR

830
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
GOODNESS SAKES.

831
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
CAN WE STOP FOR A MOMENT AND

832
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
REFLECT ON THIS?
I'M ALL FOR SPORT AND HUNTING

833
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
AND SELF-DEFENSE.

834
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
THIS GOES WAY BEYOND THAT.

835
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
>> Chris: FINALLY, SENATOR,

836
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
BLAB THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAY AND

837
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
OUR NEXT GUEST CONGRESSMAN

838
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
GOHMERT IS ONE OF THEM THAT

839
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
THE REAL ANSWER IS NOT FEWER

840
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
GUNS BUT MORE GUNS SO THAT IF

841
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
A PERSON LIKE THIS COMES TO A

842
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
MOVIE THEATER OR A MALL OR A

843
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
SCHOOL, SOMEBODY IS THERE WHO

844
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
CAN TAKE THEM DOWN.

845
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
>> I JUST -- I HONESTLY THINK

846
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
THAT THAT ARGUMENT U.S. IS --

847
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
ARGUMENT JUST DOESN'T HOLD

848
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
WATER.
TALKING ABOUT ARMING TEACHERS

849
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
AND PRINCIPALS?

850
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
IS THAT GOING TO MAKE US A

851
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
SAFER AMERICA?

852
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I DON'T THINK SO.
TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE HARMED BY

853
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
FIREARMS, THEIR OWN FIREARMS

854
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
THAT ARE ACCIDENTLY MISUSED OR

855
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
TURN ON THEM.

856
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I DON'T HAPPEN TO BUY THAT

857
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
APPROACH AT ALL.

858
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I WANT TO SIT DOWN AND CALMLY

859
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
DISCUSS ALL THE OPTIONS.

860
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT AS

861
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
A NATION.

862
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN

863
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
MOVE FORWARD AND MAKE SURE

864
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
THAT THERE IS A LESSON TO BE

865
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
LEARNED IN NEW TOWN

866
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
CONNECTICUT.
>> LET ME JUST ASK YOU AFTER

867
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
AURORA YOU SAID THERE WAS ZERO

868
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
CHANCE CONGRESS WOULD PASS A

869
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
NEW LAW.

870
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
DO YOU STILL SAY ZERO CHANCE?

871
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
>> NO.
I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN

872
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
NEW TOWN, CONNECTICUT, MAY AT

873
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
LEAST LEAD SOME TO FINALLY

874
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
DECIDE TO SIT DOWN AND TO HAVE

875
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
THIS CONVERSATION.

876
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I REALLY THINK WE MAY HAVE A

877
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
CHANCE BECAUSE OF THIS

878
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

879
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AFTER

880
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
9/11.

881
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
IT CAN HAPPEN AFTER NEW TOWN

882
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
CONNECTICUT AS WELL.

883
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
>> Chris: SENATOR DURBIN,

884
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US

885
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
TODAY, SIR.

886
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> THE CORE OF THE DEBATE GOES

887
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
TO A BASIC CONSTITUTIONAL

888
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
PROVISION THE RIGHT TO BEAR

889
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
ARMS.
DOES THIS TRAGEDY CHANGE OR

890
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
LIMIT THAT?

891
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
JOINING ME NOW REPUBLICAN

892
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
CONGRESSMAN LOUIE GOHMERT OF

893
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
TEXAS.
CONGRESSMAN, WELCOME.

894
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU,

895
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
CHRIS.

896
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
>> Chris: ATTORNEY GENERAL
HOLDER SPOKE OUT ABOUT THE

897
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
SHOOTING ON FRIDAY.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HE

898
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
SAID.

899
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
>> WE NEED TO DISCUSS WHO WE

900
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
ARE AS A NATION.

901
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
TALK ABOUT THE FREEDOMS THAT

902
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
WE HAVE.
THE RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE, AND

903
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
HOW THOSE MIGHT BE USED IN A

904
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
RESPONSIBLE WAY.

905
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
>> Chris: WHAT DO YOU THINK

906
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
ABOUT HIS COMMENTS ABOUT OUR

907
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
RIGHTS AND OUR FREEDOMS BEING

908
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
USED IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY?

909
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
>> WELL, I THINK COMING FROM

910
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
HIM, THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

911
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
TO NOTE.
COMING FROM A MAN WHO IS OVER

912
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
A DEPARTMENT THAT FORCED THE

913
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
SALE OF GUNS TO PEOPLE THAT

914
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
WOULD BRING ABOUT THE DEATH OF

915
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
PEOPLE LIKE BRIAN TERRY AND

916
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
THERE SHOULD BE NATIONAL

917
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
OUTRAGE ABOUT MEXICANS, OUR

918
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
NEIGHBORS, 200 OR MORE THAT

919
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE GUNS

920
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
THAT HIS DEPARTMENT HAVE

921
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
FORCIBLY OR FORCED TO BE SOLD.

922
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
SO, HE IS RIGHT.

923
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
AND REALLY, SENATOR DURBIN IS

924
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
RIGHT.
BUT THE CONVERSATION WE HAVE

925
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
GOT TO HAVE HAS GOT TO HAVE

926
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
EVERYBODY OPEN-MINDED.

927
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I MEAN, WE ALL REACT

928
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
EMOTIONALLY, THAT'S WHY WE

929
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
HAVE ALL SHED TEARS AND OUR

930
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
PRAYERS WILL CONTINUE TO GO

931
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
FOR THE PEOPLE IN CONNECTICUT

932
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES.

933
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
>> Chris: AFTER THE MOVIE HERE

934
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
IS THE SHOOTING IN JULY IN

935
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
AURORA, COLORADO, YOU SAID

936
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
WHAT WE NEED IS MORE PEOPLE

937
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
CARRYING WEAPONS SO THAT IF A

938
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
SHOOTER COMES INTO A MOVIE
THEATER WITH A GUN, SOMEBODY

939
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
CAN STAND UP AND DEFEND HIM

940
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
AND DEFEND OTHER PEOPLE.

941
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
QUESTION:  AND THIS IS THE

942
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
QUESTION DICK DURBIN HAD.

943
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
DO WE REALLY WANT FOLKS IN

944
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
MOVIE THEATERS, AND MALLS AND

945
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
SCHOOLS ARMED?
>> ONCE WE HAVE THIS ACTUALLY

946
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
OPEN DIALOGUE ABOUT EVER EVERY

947
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
MASS KILLING OF PEOPLE IN

948
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
RECENT HISTORY HAS BEEN IN A

949
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
PLACE WHERE GUNS WERE

950
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
PROHIBITED.

951
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
THESE GUN -- EXCEPT FOR ONE.

952
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THEY CHOOSE THIS PLACE, THEY

953
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
KNOW NO ONE WILL BE ARMED.

954
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
YOU KNOW, HAVING BEEN A JUDGE

955
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
AND HAVING REVIEWED

956
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THESE HORRIFIC

957
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
SCENES AND KNOWING THAT

958
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
CHILDREN HAVE THESE DEFENSIVE

959
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
WOUNDS, GUNSHOTS THROUGH THEIR

960
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
ARMS AND HANDS AS THEY TRY TO

961
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
PROTECT THEMSELVES, AND

962
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
HEARING THE HEROIC STORIES OF

963
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
THE PRINCIPAL LUNGING TRYING

964
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
TO PROTECT, CHRIS, I WISH TO

965
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
GOD SHE HAD HAD AN M 4 IN HER

966
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
OFFICE LOCKED UP SO THAT WHEN

967
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
SHE HEARD GUNFIRE SHE PULLS IT

968
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
OUT AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO

969
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
LUNGE HEROICALLY WITH NOTHING

970
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
IN HIS HANDS TAKES HIM OUT AND

971
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
TAKES HIS HEAD OFF BEFORE HE

972
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
COULD KILL THOSE PRECIOUS

973
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
KIDS.

974
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
>> Chris: I UNDERSTAND THE
RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS AND THE

975
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
SUPREME COURT MEANT SUPREME

976
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
COURT WAS CLEAR WHEN THEY PUT

977
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS IN THE

978
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
CONSTITUTION.
LET ME ASK YOU THE QUESTION

979
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
DICK DURBIN ASKED.

980
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
WHY DO PEOPLE NEED THESE

981
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS?

982
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I WAS READING ABOUT THE GLOCK

983
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
HE HAD AND THE SIGSOWER HE

984
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
HAD.
FIVE BULLETS A SECOND BUSH

985
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
MASTER.
THESE WERE CREATED FOR LAW

986
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
ENFORCEMENT.

987
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
THESE WERE CREATED FOR THE

988
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
MILITARY.
WHY DOES THE AVERAGE PERSON.

989
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I CAN UNDERSTAND HUNTING RIFLE

990
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
AND HUNTING GUN.

991
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
WHY DO THESE WEAPONS OF MASS

992
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
DESTRUCTION.

993
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
>> FOR THE REASON THAT GEORGE

994
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
WASHINGTON SAID.
A FREE PEOPLE SHOULD BE AN

995
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
ARMED PEOPLE.

996
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
IT ENSURES AGAINST THE TYRANNY

997
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
OF THE GOVERNMENT.

998
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
IF THEY KNOW THAT THE BIGGEST

999
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
ARMY IS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,

1000
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE

1001
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
TYRANNY THAT CAME FROM KING

1002
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
GEORGE.
THAT'S WHY IT WAS PUT IN

1003
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
THERE.
THAT'S WHY ONCE YOU START

1004
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
DRAWING THE LINE WHERE DO YOU

1005
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
STOP?

1006
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
AND THAT'S WHY IT IS IMPORTANT

1007
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
TO NOT JUST LOOK EMOTIONALLY.

1008
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
OUR REACTION IS TO IMMEDIATELY

1009
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
SAY LET'S GET RID OF ALL GUNS.

1010
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
YOU DO AS IT A JUDGE.

1011
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
YOU REACT EMOTIONALLY BUT YOU

1012
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
USE YOUR HEAD AND YOU LOOK AT

1013
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
THE FACTS.

1014
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
AND THE FACTS ARE THAT EVERY

1015
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
TIME GUNS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED,

1016
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
CONCEAL CARRIES HAVE BEEN

1017
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
ALLOWED.

1018
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
THE CRIME RATE HAS GONE DOWN.

1019
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
WASHINGTON, D.C. AROUND US

1020
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
OUGHT TO BE THE SAFEST PLACE

1021
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
IN AMERICA.
AND IT'S NOT.

1022
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
CHICAGO OUGHT TO BE SAFE.
IT'S NOT.

1023
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
BECAUSE THEIR GUN LAWS DON'T

1024
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
WORK.
>> Chris: CONGRESSMAN, THANK

1025
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING IN TODAY.

1026
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
WE WILL SEE WHERE THIS DEBATE

1027
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
COMES FROM HERE.

1028

>> THANKS SO MUCH.

1029
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
>> Chris: UP NEXT, WE WILL
TALK WITH AN EXPERT ABOUT WHAT

1030
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
CAN BE DONE TO MAKE OUR

1031
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000

CLASSROOM.
ABOUT TAKING ASPIRIN.

1036
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
BUT THEY HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
EXTRA STRENGTH
Bayer Advanced Aspirin.

1038
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
IN FACT, IN A RECENT SURVEY,

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
95% OF PEOPLE

1040
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000

SCHOOL SHOOTING CONFRONT SOME

1045
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
QUESTIONS IS MY CHILD'S SCHOOL

1046
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
AS SAFE AS IT SHOULD BE.

1047
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE?

1048
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
JOINING ME NOW FROM CALABASAS,

1049
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
CALIFORNIA, IS RONALD STEVENS,

1050
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL

1051
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
SCHOOL SAFETY CENTER.

1052
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
SHEAND HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

1053
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
HAD RECENTLY INSTALLED A NEW

1054
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
SECURITY SYSTEM.
THE DOORS WERE LOCKED AT 9:30.

1055
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
YOU HAD TO BE BUZZED IN.

1056
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
TO GET INTO THE SCHOOL.

1057
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
BUT POLICE SAY THE SHOOTER

1058
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
FORCED HIS WAY IN SO I GUESS

1059
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT MORE CAN

1060
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
A SCHOOL DO?

1061
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
>> IT'S A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE

1062
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
FOR SCHOOL OFFICIALS BECAUSE

1063
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
SCHOOL CAMPUSES ARE NOT

1064
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
DESIGNED TO BE FORTRESSES TO

1065
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
BE DEFENDED.

1066
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
THEY ARE PLACES OF LEARNING.

1067
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
SO, THE EXPECTATION FOR

1068
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
SCHOOLS IS THAT THEY WOULD

1069
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
TAKE REASONABLE STEPS AND WHEN

1070
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
WE LOOK AT THE COMPASSION AND

1071
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
CARE AND SACRIFICE OF THE

1072
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
ADMINISTRATORS AND TEACHERS,

1073
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE

1074
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS BUT

1075
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
BUNS AGAIN IF YOU HAVE AN

1076
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
ARMED GETTING ON TO THE CAMPUS

1077
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
THEY WILL USE USE WHATEVER

1078
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
MEANS NECESSARY.

1079
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
NOT UNCOMMON SITUATION WHERE

1080
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
THEY DEFEAT SOME THE BEST

1081
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN PLACE.

1082
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
>> Chris: I WAS FASCINATED,

1083
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
MR. STEVENS, BY HOW MUCH

1084
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
SECURITY AND I DIDN'T REALIZE

1085
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
THIS A LOT OF OUR PUBLIC

1086
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE, LET'S

1087
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE

1088
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
SECURITY MEASURES THAT ARE

1089
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
ALREADY THERE.

1090
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
92% OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS LOCK OR

1091
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
MONITOR THEIR DOORS.

1092
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
61% USE SECURITY CAMERAS.

1093
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
63% USE ELECTRONIC

1094
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
NOTIFICATION FOR A SCHOOL

1095
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
EMERGENCY.
WHAT ARE THE BIG GAPS YOU

1096
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
STILL SEE OUT THERE, SIR?

1097
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
>> ONE OF THE BIGGEST GAPS

1098
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
THAT I SEE IS THAT SCHOOLS SO

1099
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
OFTEN ARE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR

1100
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
NOT SUPPOSED TO EVER BE

1101
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
LETTING THESE KINDS OF

1102
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
INCIDENTS OCCUR.

1103
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
AND, YET, THE SCHOOLS REFLECT

1104
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
SO MUCH WHAT'S GOING ON IN

1105
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
SOCIETY.
WE WANT SCHOOLS TO TAKE STEPS

1106
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
THAT ARE APPROPRIATE BUT THERE

1107
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
ARE LIMITATIONS AND UNTIL

1108
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
SOMEONE IS ABLE TO CONTROL THE

1109
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
HUMAN MIND IN THESE CHOICES

1110
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
THAT ARE MADE BY DERANGED

1111
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
INDIVIDUALS, IT'S GOING TO BE

1112
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
VERY DIFFICULT.

1113
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I THINK THIS NATIONAL

1114
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
CONVERSATION THAT WE ARE

1115
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
TALKING ABOUT HAS TO GO BEYOND

1116
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
SCHOOLS IN THE COMMUNITIES AND

1117
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
TO HOMES INTO.

1118
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
GATHER.

1119
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
KEEP OUR SAFER.

1120
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
>> Chris: YOU HEARD WHAT

1121
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
CONGRESSMAN GOHMERT JUST SAID,

1122
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
DO WE NEED ARMED GUARDS INSIDE

1123
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
SCHOOLS?
DO WE NEED A TEACHER OR SOME

1124
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
KIND OF PERSONNEL, THE

1125
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
PRINCIPAL WHO KNOWS AND HAS

1126
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
HOW TO FIRE AND HAS A WEAPON

1127
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
WITH HIM?

1128
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
>> I WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO

1129
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
HAVE ARMED GUARDS IN THE

1130
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
SCHOOLS.

1131
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
AND, YET, THE KINDS OF THINGS

1132
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
THAT ARE HAPPENING NOW HAS

1133
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
BEEN ONE OF THE CHIEF ITEMS

1134
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
THAT HAS ENCOURAGED THE

1135
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
PRESENCE OF SCHOOL RESOURCE

1136
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
OFFICERS ALL ACROSS THE

1137
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
COUNTRY.
BUT, EVEN ON THE BEST OF DAYS,

1138
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
TO ASSUME THAT THE OFFICER

1139
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
WILL ALWAYS BE IN THE RIGHT

1140
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AT THE

1141
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
RIGHT MOMENT IS DIFFICULT.

1142
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
YOU LOOK AT RED LAKE, MINUTE

1143
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
SOCIETY THAT HAD OFFICERS AT

1144
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
THE SCHOOLHOUSE GATE AS WELL

1145
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
AS METAL DETECTORS AND YET THE

1146
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
ASSAILANT COMES, IN TAKES OUT

1147
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
THE OFFICER, WALKS RIGHT

1148
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
THROUGH THE METAL DETECTORS.

1149
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
THERE ARE THINGS THAT

1150
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
OFTENTIMES SIMPLY CAN'T.

1151
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
SCOPE AND CONTROL OF SCHOOL

1152
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
OFFICIALS THAT THESE ARE ARE

1153
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE

1154
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
FACE.

1155
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
>> ONE THING THAT SEEMED

1156
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR FROM WHAT

1157
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
HAPPENED AT SANDY HOOK IS THEY

1158
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
HAVE DONE A LOT OF TRAINING

1159
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
THERE HAD BEEN A LOT OF SAFETY

1160
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
DRILLS AND IT SURE SEEMED, IN

1161
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
TERMS OF THE RESPONSE IN THE

1162
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
CLASSROOMS AND EVACUATING THE

1163
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
KIDS FROM THE SCHOOL THAT SURE

1164
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
SEEMED TO MAKE A BIG

1165
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
DIFFERENCE IN SAVING LIVES.

1166
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
>> WELL, IT ABSOLUTELY DID.

1167
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
AND WE'RE PROBABLY A LOT

1168
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
BETTER AT CRISIS RESPONSE THAN

1169
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
WE ARE AT CRISIS PREVENTION.

1170
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
BUT HAVE THOSE DRILLS IN PLACE

1171
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
TO HAVE WORKED WITH

1172
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
ADMINISTRATOR STAFF, THE FIRST

1173
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
RESPONDERS AND THE STUDENTS.

1174
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I THINK IS A REMARKABLE

1175
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
TRIBUTE TO WHAT SCHOOL

1176
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
OFFICIALS HAD DONE THERE.

1177
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
BUT MY TAKE IS WE HAVE GOT TO

1178
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
CONTINUE TO FOCUS MORE ON HOW

1179
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
WE ADDRESS THIS WHOLE DEAL OF

1180
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
THE CRISIS PREVENTION AT THE

1181
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
OUTSET IN ADDITION TO SIMPLY

1182
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
GOOD CRISIS RESPONSE.

1183
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
>> MR. STEVENS, WE HAVE TO

1184
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
LEAF IT THERE THANK YOU SO

1185
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000

THERE.
>> MY PLEASURE.

1187
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
>> IN A HOLIDAY SEASON SHATTER

1188
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
ITED BY GUNFIRE A GRIEVING

1189
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
NATION ASKED WHY AND WHAT CAN

1190
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
BE DONE.

1191
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
NEXT, WE WILL HEAR FROM OUR

1192
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000

00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

1194
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
>> IT WAS GREAT TO SEE THEM AT

1195
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
THE SAME TIME WE HAD A LOT OF

1196
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T FIND THEIR

1197
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
KIDS.

1198
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
PERSONAL I HAVE A GOOD FRIEND
THAT LOST HER DAUGHTER.

1199
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
SO IT'S VERY BITTER SWEET.

1200
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR.

1209
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
A LIST OF SOME OF THE MASS

1210
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
SHOOTINGS.

1211
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
' 2012.

1212
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
SCHOOL JULY 20TH.

1213
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
AURORA COLORADO.

1214
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
WHITE SPRIM MIST IN A SIKH

1215
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000

1217
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
LANZA KILLS 27 PLUS HIMSELF.

1218
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
IN FACT THERE WERE 1313 MASS

1219
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
SHOOTINGS SO FAR THIS YEAR.

1220
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
BRIT, WHAT IS GOING ON?

1221
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
>> WE CERTAINLY WE DO YET,

1222
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
THIS ONE.

1223
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
DAY COMES UP AND I THINK THAN

1224
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
ANY OF THE OTHERS BECAUSE OF

1225
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
THE SCALE OF IT AND BECAUSE OF

1226
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
VICTIMS WERE LITTLE CHILDREN.

1227
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
AND SO I THINK LOOKING AT IT

1228
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
FROM A WASHINGTON PERSPECTIVE,

1229
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
POLITICALLY IMPACT OF IT IS

1230
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
LIKELY TO BE GREATER.

1231
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
THE HARD THING TO DO IN

1232
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
COMMENTING ON REACTING TO THIS

1233
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
IS THAT SO MUCH OF THE

1234
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE

1235
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
GOTTEN SO FAR HAS TURNED OUT

1236
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
TO BE DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS.

1237
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
SO MUCH WE KNOW AND IT WILL BE

1238
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
A WHILE BEFORE IT'S POSSIBLE.

1239
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
INTELLIGENT OBSERVATIONS.

1240
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
WHAT KIND OF STEPS CAN BE

1241
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
TAKEN TO PREVENT THIS.

1242
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
>> NINA, PRESIDENT OBAMA

1243
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
TALKED ABOUT TAKING MEEKFUL

1244
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
ACTION.
BUT HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT

1245
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
TAKING ACTION AFTER THE

1246
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
SHOOTING OF GABRIEL GIFFORDS

1247
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
IN JANUARY OF 2011 THAT KILLED

1248
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
SIX AND WOUNDED 13 AND HE

1249
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
NEVER DID.
DO YOU THINK, WE TALK ABOUT.

1250
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
THIS THE IMPACT THE SOME

1251
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
PEOPLE ARE COMPARING

1252
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
EMOTIONALLY TO A 9/11 THAT

1253
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
AFTER THE MASSACRE OF THESE

1254
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
CHILDREN AND NOW RE-ELECTION.

1255
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
THAT HE MIGHT ACTUALLY PUSH
FOR GUN CONTROL?

1256
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
>> I THINK THIS IS A TIPPING

1257
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
POINT.

1258
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
HE SPOKE ON FRIDAY, NOT JUST

1259
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
AS A -- NOT JUST AS A

1260
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
PRESIDENT BUT AS A FATHER AND

1261
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I HAD JUST LEFT MY DAUGHTER'S

1262
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CONCERT AND

1263
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I THINK BACK TO THE SHOOTING

1264
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
IN THE COLORADO MALL.

1265
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
MY SONS, MY TEENAGE SONS WERE

1266
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
SEEING THE DARK KNIGHT THAT

1267
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
NIGHT.
MY NEPHEW LOST A FRIEND AND

1268
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
ATTENDED THE VIRGINIA TECH.

1269
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
KEEP IN MIND THIS WAS THE

1270
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
SECOND WORSE SCHOOL SHOOTING,

1271
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
VIRGINIA TECH WAS EVEN WORSE.

1272
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

1273
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
PRESIDENT AT THIS POINT TO

1274
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
TAKE A LOOK BE DONE IN A

1275
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
BIPARTISAN WAY AND AGREE WITH

1276
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
SENATOR LIEBERMAN IT HAS TO BE

1277
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
COMMISSION, URGENT COMMISSION.

1278
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
HAVE YOU GOT TO TAKE -- YOU

1279
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
HAVE GOT TO LOOK AT HOW TO

1280
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
TAKE THE WORD MASS OUT OF MASS

1281
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
MURDER.
YOU KNOW, BODIES, 6-YEAR-OLD

1282
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
BODIES WITH 3 TO 11 WULTS IN

1283
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
THEM.

1284
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY NOT

1285
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
EASY, NOT GUN CONTROL.

1286
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I'M NOT ARGUING THAT.

1287
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
WHEN YOU CAN GO ONLINE AND

1288
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
ORDER A MAGAZINE WITH 100

1289
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION FOR $299,

1290
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
SOMETHING'S WRONG.
I THINK IT HAS TO START THERE

1291
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
IT ALSO HAS TO LOOK AT THE

1292
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
WARNING THAT WERE IN PLACE IN

1293
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
ALL OF THESE SITUATIONS.

1294
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, PRIVACY

1295
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
ISSUES.
THERE IS A LOT OF ISSUES THAT

1296
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
GO INTO THIS.
I DO THINK GUN CONTROL HAS TO

1297
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
BE PART OF IT.

1298
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
>> BILL, LET'S LOOK AT THIS

1299
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
FROM THE REPUBLICAN POINT OF

1300
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
VIEW.
SHOULD REPUBLICANS CHANGE OR

1301
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
MODIFY THEIR STRONG OPPOSITION

1302
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
TO GUN CONTROL, ESPECIALLY NOT

1303
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS BUT

1304
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
ESPECIALLY ON THIS QUESTION OF

1305
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
THESE WEAPONS OF MASS

1306
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
DESTRUCTION.

1307
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
YOU KNOW, AS I SAY, THE

1308
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
HANDGUN THAT COULD FIRE FIVE

1309
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
BULLETS IN A SECOND.

1310
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
THE MAGAZINES, 100 ROUNDS.

1311
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
SHOULD REPUBLICANS CONSIDER

1312
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
GIVING ON THAT ISSUE?

1313
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
>> I THINK REPUBLICANS AND

1314
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD TAKE A

1315
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
SERIOUS LOOK AT WHAT MIGHT

1316
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
WORK.
I THINK THE SPEAKER COULD WELL

1317
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
ASK THE REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN OF

1318
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO

1319
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
HOLD HEARINGS.

1320
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
HOLD SERIOUS HEARINGS ABOUT

1321
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
WHAT WOULD WORK.
DON'T DO SOMETHING SYMBOLIC

1322
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
LIKE THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN

1323
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
WHICH DID NO GOOD END UP

1324
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
EVAPORATING AND SUSTAINED

1325
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
DEMOCRATIC WASN'T RESTORED

1326
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
WHEN THE DEMOCRATS RESTORED
EVERYTHING IN 2009, 2010.

1327
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
SO I'M TOTALLY OPEN TO HAVING

1328
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
SERIOUS -- A LOT OF SOCIAL

1329
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
SCIENCE RESEARCH ON GUN

1330
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
CONTROL.
I DON'T THINK IT'S FAVORABLE

1331
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
TO MOST EFFORTS OF GUN

1332
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
CONTROL.

1333
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I THINK EVERYTHING HAS TO BE

1334
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
ON THE TABLE TOO.

1335
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
IS IT GUN FREE ZONES.

1336
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
MAYBE HAVING SECURITY GUARDS

1337
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
THAN HAVING DO BACKGROUND

1338
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
CHECKS IN A CASE WHERE THE

1339
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
PURCHASE OF THE GUNS IN THIS

1340
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
CASE PASS BACKGROUND CHECK.

1341
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
CONNECTICUT IS A PRETTY

1342
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
LIBERAL STATE.

1343
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

1344
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
CONTROLS ALL THE BRANCHES OF

1345
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
GOVERNMENT IN CONNECTICUT.

1346
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
THEY CHOSE NOT TO BAN THE

1347
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
THINGS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.

1348
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I GUESS.

1349
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
THEY COULD HAVE.
COULDN'T THEY?

1350
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
>> STATE LAWS ARE USELESS.

1351
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
CAN YOU ORDER THINGS ONLINE

1352
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
NOW.
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT -- I'M

1353
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
JUST SAYING LET'S HAVE AN

1354
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
HONEST DEBATE AND PRIVACY

1355
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
LAWS, MENTAL HEALTH.
I DO THINK THE REPUBLICAN

1356
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
PARTY SHOULDN'T BE IN A

1357
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
POSITION OF SAYING YOU CAN'T

1358
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
EVEN DISCUSS.

1359
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
THIS I THINK THE SPEAKER COULD

1360
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
EASILY ASK CONTROL ONE HOUSE

1361
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
OF CONGRESS, SENATOR REID

1362
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
COULD THIS ON THE OTHER SIDE.

1363
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
HAVE SIROUS HEARINGS ABOUT THE

1364
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
LEGAL ISSUES AND THE PUBLIC

1365
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
POLICY ISSUES.

1366
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
>> Chris: YOU KNOW, LIZ, I'M

1367
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
SURE THAT SOME OF OUR

1368
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
LISTENERS LISTENED TO THIS

1369
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
TALK ABOUT JOE LIEBERMAN

1370
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
CALLING FOR A COMMISSION OR

1371
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
BILL KRISTOL CALLING FOR

1372
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
HEARINGS.
AND I DON'T MEAN THIS IN A

1373
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
BELITTLING WAY.

1374
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
THEY THINK WE HAVE HEARD THIS

1375
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
ALL BEFORE.

1376
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
THAT JUST MEANS WE WILL HAVE

1377
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
SOME DOCUMENTS, WE'LL HAVE

1378
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
SOME HEARINGS AND NOTHING WILL

1379
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
HAPPEN.

1380
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
AND MAYBE NOTHING SHOULD

1381
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
HAPPEN.

1382
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WILL SIT

1383
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
THERE AND SAY MORE OF THE

1384
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
SAME.

1385
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
>> AND THAT IS POSSIBLE.

1386
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I THINK I AGREE WITH NINA THAT

1387
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
THIS FEELS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A

1388
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
TIPPING POINT.
AND ONE OF THE PHRASES YOU

1389
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
KEEP HEARING IS THAT PEOPLE

1390
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
ARE FED UP.

1391
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
THERE SEEMS TO BE THIS DESIRE

1392
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
FOR ACTION.
NOT JUST A COMMISSION OR A

1393
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
REPORT OR A DEBATE OR A

1394
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
NATIONAL DEBATE.

1395
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
THERE SEEMS TO BE A STRONGER

1396
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
DESIRE FOR LET'S FIND SOME

1397
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
CONCRETE STEPS MAYBE THAT WE

1398
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
CAN TAKE RIGHT AWAY.

1399
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
EVEN IF THEY MAKE ONLY A

1400
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
SLIGHT DIFFERENCE.
MAYBE THAT WILL EFFECT IT IT I

1401
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
ALSO WONDER IF THE POLITICS OF

1402
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
THIS MIGHT CHANGE.

1403
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
WE ARE SEEN, YOU KNOW, OVER

1404
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
THE LAST FEW DECADES, GALLUP

1405
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
HAS SHOWN SUPPORT FOR GUN

1406
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
CONTROL HAS FALLEN OFF PRETTY

1407
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
DRAMATICALLY.
YOU WONDER IF IN THE WAKE OF

1408
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
THIS PAST ELECTION THE

1409
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
DEMOCRATIC COALITION SEEMS TO

1410
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
BE CHANGING SOMEWHAT.

1411
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
YOU WONDER IF DEMOCRATIC

1412
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
POLITICIANS MAY NOT SEE THIS

1413
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
AS SUCH A THIRD RAIL ISSUE AS

1414
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
THEY HAD AS YOU SAID WITH

1415
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
LIEBERMAN AFTER THE 2000

1416
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
ELECTION AND IN RECENT YEARS.

1417
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
>> YOU KNOW, BRIT, ONE OF THE

1418
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
THINGS THAT I VALUE MOST ABOUT

1419
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
YOU IS WHEN EVERYBODY IS

1420
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
RUSHING IN ONE DIRECTION, YOU

1421
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
ARE A CONTRARIAN AND YOU SAY

1422
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
WAIT A MINUTE.

1423
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

1424
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
HERE.

1425
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
REALLY.
WE DON'T.

1426
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
INSIDE THAT ELM.

1427
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
WHO WE DON'T KNOW WHY FOR SURE

1428
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
THIS WOMAN SEEMED COMPELLED TO

1429
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
BUY ALL THESE WEAPONS IF

1430
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
INDEED THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS

1431
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
YOUNG MAN.
WE NEED TO KNOW ALL OF THAT

1432
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
BEFORE WE MAKE -- START MAKING

1433
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
ANY POLICY PREDICTIONS.

1434
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
WE ALSO NEED TO FIND OUT AS

1435
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
BEST WE CAN WHAT INFLUENCES

1436
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
WITHIN THE CULTURE HAVE

1437
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
CREATED THIS -- MAY HAVE

1438
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
HELPED TO CREATE THIS WAVE OF

1439
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
VIOLENCE.
PERHAPS A DECENTIZATION TO

1440
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
VIOLENCE.
YOU SEE IT ON THE SCREEN.

1441
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY THERE IS

1442
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
NO PERHAPS.

1443
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
THERE HAS BEEN.

1444
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I SEE MY KIDS PLAYING THESE

1445
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
GAMES WHERE THEY ARE SOLDIERS.

1446
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
>> LOOK, I PLAYED A LOT OF

1447
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
GUNS WHEN I WAS A KID.

1448
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
SEE A LOT OF COWBOY WESTERNS.

1449
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
>> Chris: IT'S DIFFERENT.

1450
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
>> I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU.

1451
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
THAT NEEDS TO BE PART OF IT.

1452
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT AS

1453
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
YELL.
THERE IS A LOT IN THIS.

1454
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
IF THERE IS GOING TO BE

1455
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
INVESTIGATION IT SHOULDN'T

1456
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
FOCUS ON SINGLE ISSUE IT

1457
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
SHOULD FOCUS ON ALL THE THINGS

1458
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO

1459
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
THIS SO WE GET A BETTER

1460
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
PICTURE OF IT.

1461
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
>> Chris: WHAT ABOUT THE

1462
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
AVERAGEMENT IF YOU HAVE THE

1463
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
COMMISSIONS AND YOU HAVE THE

1464
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
HEARINGS, NOTHING HAPPENS?

1465
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
>> THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE

1466
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
CASE.

1467
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
YOU HAVE COMMISSIONS AND

1468
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
HEARINGS AND SOMETIMES THINGS

1469
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
DO HAPPEN.

1470
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
WE HAD A BIG COMMISSION AFTER

1471
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
9/11 AND THINGS DID HAPPEN.

1472
