SPEAKER BOEHNER SAYING, LOOK,

260
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
WHY NOT JUST TRY TO DO A SMALLER

261
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
BIT OF THIS AND BASICALLY JUST

262
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
SET A NEW THRESHHOLD OF $1

263
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
MILLION OR MORE FOR RAISING

264
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
TAXES, DEAL WITH THAT AS SORT OF

265
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
A SO-CALLED PLAN (B) BECAUSE HE

266
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
IS FRUSTRATED THAT THE BROADER

267
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
DIFFERENT DEAL DOESN'T SEEM TO

268
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
BE GOING ANYWHERE.

269
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
>> IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR OUR

COUNTRY BUT AT THIS POINT HAVING

271
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
A BACKUP PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT

272
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
FEW AMERICAN TAXPAYERS WERE

273
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
AFFECTED BY THIS INCREASE AS

274
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
POSSIBLE, MOVING DOWN THAT PATH

275
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
IS THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION

276
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
FOR US.

277
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000

282
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
HAVE MOVED THE BALL FORWARD.

THE WHITE HOUSE EYES IS THIS

289
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
WOULD NOT RAISE ENOUGH REVENUE

290
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
IF YOU SET THE THEY HOLD $1

291
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000

WITH CORRESPONDENT WHOSE MET

375
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000

377
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
THANK GOD RICHARD ENGEL AND THE

379
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
>>Jonathan: WE OBSERVED THAT

380
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
BLACKOUT AT NBC REQUEST BUT A

381
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
TERRIFYING REQUEST FOR HIM AND

382
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
HIS COLLEAGUES.

383
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
IMAGINE THIS: 15 GUNMEN ALL

384
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
WEARING SKI MASKED AMBUSHED THEM

385
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
AND MOVED THEM CONSTANTLY BLIND

386
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
FOLDED AND HOODED FROM SAFE

387
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
HOUSE TO SAFE HOUSE.

388
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
THEY NEVER KNEW WHERE THEY WERE

389
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
AND THEN THE MOCK EXECUTIONS.

390
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
IMAGINE THE TERROR OF THAT.

391
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
YOU ARE HOODED.

392
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
THEY ASK WHICH YOU IS GOING DO

393
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
DIE.
FIRST YOU REFUSE TO GIVE AN

394
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
ANSWER.
AND YOU SIMPLY HEAR A RIFLE

395
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
BEING FIRED.

396
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
NOT SURPRISINGLY, ENGEL AND THE

397
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
OTHERS ALL SAY THEY SIMPLY WANT

398
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
TO PUT THE EXPERIENCE BEHIND

399
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
THEM.
>> THE LAST FIVE DAYS WERE VERY

400
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
DIFFICULT.

401
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
WE VERY HAPPY TO BE OUT.

402

WE APPRECIATE ALL THE HELP.

THE LAST FIVE DAYS ARE DAYS WE

407
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000

TALKING TO OTHER WHOSE HAVE BEEN

THROUGH SIMILAR SPENTS,

411
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
FORGETTING IS A VERY DIFFICULT

412
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
THING TO DO.

417
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000

NIGHTLY NEWS ALL THE TIME, BUT

421
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
THERE IS ANOTHER AMERICAN

422
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
JOURNALIST, A FREELANCER, A

423
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
WRITER FROM THE "WASHINGTON

425
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
HE IS A FORMER MAIN.

YOU MAY NOT HEARD OF 31 HAS NOT

427
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
BEEN HEARD FROM, SINCE AUGUST

428

13.

429
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
BELIEVED HELD IN SYRIA.

430
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
NO ONE KNOWS BY WHOM.

431
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
IT IS MOST LIKELY GOVERNMENT

432
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
FORCES BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW.

433
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
HIS PARENTS ARE DESPERATELY

434
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
TRYING TO GET NEWS OF HUM.

435
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
JUST ANOTHER DEMONSTRATION OF

436
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
HOW DANGEROUS SYRIA IS.

437
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
WE HAVE HAD COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE

438
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
BEEN KILLED THIS.

439
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
SYRIAN CIVILIANS, OF COURSE,

440
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
CONTINUE TO DIE EVERY DAY THIS.

441
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
>>Shepard: MORE THAN 40,000.

442
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
THANK YOU.

443
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
SYRIA'S LONG TIME ALLY, RUSSIA,

444
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
IS SENDING WARSHIPS TO SYRIA TO

445
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
PREPARE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF

446
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
THE EVACUATION OF THEIR

447
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
CITIZENS.

448
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
THE REPORT FROM RUSSIAN STATE

449
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
MEDIA IS ANOTHER POTENTIAL SIGN

450
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
THAT NOW IS LOSING FAITH IN THE

451
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
SYRIAN REGIME.

452
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
LAST WEEK A TOP RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT

453
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
ADMITTED BASHAR AL-ASSAD COULD

454
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
LOSE THE CIVIL WAR.

455
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
WE HAVE THE FORMER DEFENSE

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE

COHEN GROUP.
NICE TO SEE YOU, SIR.

460
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
THIS WAS A TIME WHEN THERE WERE

461
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
RULES OF WARFARE, THERE WAS A

462
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
FRONT LINE, THERE WERE RULES

463
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE WHO

464
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
GATHER AND GIVE OUT INFORMATION

465
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
BUT THERE ARE NO RULES NOW.

466
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
>>Guest: NO, WE HAVE NO RULES.

467
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
WE HAVE ENEMIES THAT ARE TOUGH

468
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
TO IDENTIFY.

469
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
THEY CAN BE WITH YOU DURING THE

470
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
DAY AS FRIENDLY AS WE HAVE SEEN

471
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
IN AFGHANISTAN AND THEN BE

472
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
ENEMIES AT NIGHT.

473
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
IT IS A DIFFERENT WORLD WE ARE

474
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
LIVING AND SYRIA IS A CLASSIC

475
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF WAR

476
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
UNDERWAY.

477
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
>>Jonathan: THE CHEMICAL

478
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
WEAPONS ARE A MAJOR CONCERN FOR

479
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
U.S. OFFICIALS AND THE STATE

480
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN SAID

481
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
THAT, SAYING THEY COULD FALL IN

482
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
THE HANDS OF THE REBELS AND THEY

483
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
COULD USE THEM.

484
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THE CHEMICAL

485
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
WEAPONS?
>>Guest: I AM SURE THAT THE

486
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
PENTAGON IS NOW REVIEWING ALL OF

487
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
THE CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS ON

488
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
THE BOARD, SO TO SPEAK.

489
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
THIS IS ONE OF THE REAL DANGERS

490
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
WE HAVE.

491
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
IF THE REBELS TAKE OVER, THEN

492
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
WHAT?
WHO ARE AMONG THE REBELS?

493
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
AL QAEDA ELEMENTS IN THERE?

494
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
SECURING THOSE PLACES WILL BE

495
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
VERY IMPORTANT.

496
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF

497
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS.

498
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
WE WILL HAVE TO SHARE THAT

499
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
INFORMATION CERTAINLY WITH THE

500
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
ISRAELS, THE RUSSIANS WILL BE

501
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT IT.

502
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
ALL COUNTRIES SHOULD BE

503
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
CONCERNED ABOUT SHOULD THE

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL AGENTS

505
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
END UP IN THE HANDS OF TERRORIST

506
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
GROUPS.

507
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
WE ARE OUGHT AT RISK.

508
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
>>Jonathan: FOR SKEPTICAL

509
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
AMERICANS, HOW DO WE TRUST WHAT

510
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
WE ARE TOLD BY OUR OWN

511
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
OFFICIALS?

512
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
>>Guest: WELL, THE BAR OF

513
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
SKEPTICISM IS PRETTY HIGH FOR

514
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
MOST MEMBERS.

515
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I CAN TELL YOU, WAY BACK IN THE

516
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
80'S WHEN I SERVED ON THE

517
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IN THE

518
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
SENATE, I SAW EVIDENCE WE OF

519
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
WHAT THE SYRIANS WERE DOING WITH

520
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
THEIR NERVE AGENTS AND CHEMICAL

521
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
WEAPONS.
IT IS PRETTY DEALER THEY DO HAVE

522
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
THEM.
IT WAS ALSO CLEAR THAT IRAQ, IN

523
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
FACT, HAD THEM.

524
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
AND SADDAM HAD USED THEM.

525
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
SO WE KNOW THEY BEEN THIS THE

526
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
POSSESSION OF SADDAM HUSSEIN AT

527
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
ONE POINT.

528
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
WE BELIEVE THAT THE CHEMICAL

529
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
WEAPONS ARE STILL IN THE

530
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
POSITION OF THE SYRIAN

531
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
GOVERNMENT.
THAT IS A REAL DANGER WE HAVE TO

532
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
FOCUS ON, HOW DO WE SECURE THEM?

533
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
WE, WORKING WITH OTHER NATIONS

534
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,

535
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
IF AT ALL POSSIBLE, TO MAKE SURE

536
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
THAT EITHER THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS

537
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
OR THE CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL

538
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
WEAPONS DON'T FALL IN THE WRONG

539
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000

00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
SUE INSTAGRAM AND CLAIM YOUR

743
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
LIKENESS BELONGS TO YOU AS A

744
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
MODEL IN THAT PICTURE FOR

PURPOSES OF COMMERCIAL SALE

BE 13 YEARS OLD TO SIGN UP FOR

AGREEMENT WORKS YOU CAN BE ANY

751
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
AGE AND INSTAGRAM HAS THE RIGHT

752
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
TO USE YOUR PICTURE.

753
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000

754
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
>>Trace: YOU CAN'T.

755
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
YOU HAVE TO DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT.

756
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
THE PROGRAM SAYS THAT ONCE YOU

757
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
LOG ON TO INSTAGRAM THAT IS THE

758
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
HOW IT ENDS UP, YOU ARE THEIRS

759
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
AND YOU HAVE AGREED TO THE

760
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
TERMS.

761
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
INSTAGRAM SAYS THE CHANGES ARE

762
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
MAINLY TO HELP COMBAT SPAM BUT A

763
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
LOST USERS WE SPOKE WITH ARE

764
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
VERY SKEPTICAL.

765
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
>> I MIGHT HESITATE.

766
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I AM NOT SURE HOW MUCH I WILL GO

767
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
TO NOT POSTING.

768
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
>> IT IS GETTING VERY SCARY WHAT

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
PEOPLE ARE DOING WITH PERSONAL

770
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
PICTURES.

771
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
IT MAKES ME THINK TWICE ABOUT

772
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
TAKING PICTURES AND POSTING

773
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
THEM.

774
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000

775
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000

777
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000

EDITOR HAS MORE, AND THE WORD IS

784
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
"TRANSFERSABLE," WHICH IS THE

785
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
WORD OF INTEREST.

786
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
>>Guest: EXACTLY.

787
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
IT MAKES SENSE THEY WOULD WANT A

788
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
LICENSE TO YOUR CONTENT WHICH IS

789
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
SOMETHING THAT WAS ALREADY IN

790
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
THEIR AGREEMENT.

791
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
THE CHANGE ADS THAT WERE

792
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000

TRANSFERS RIGHTS TO OUR PICTURES

794
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000

THAT IS WHY PEOPLE HAVE FREAKED

795
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
OUT.

796
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000

799
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
UPSETTING FOR THE PERSON THAT

800
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
TOOK THE PICTURE.

801
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
IF I TOOK IT, IT WOULD BE A

TO A WEDDING AND YOU TAKE 300 OR

808
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
400 PICTURES AND RATHER THAN

809
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
PRINTING THEM AND GIVING THEM TO

810
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
PEOPLE OR SHOWING THEM YOU PUT

811
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000

00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
SAY, YES, WE WANT THIS OR THAT,

813
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
AND THEY CAN BE CHARGED FOR THE

814
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
ONES THEY GET.

815
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000

816
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
OF A LOOSELY WRITTEN AGREEMENT.

817
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000

SAID, WELL, THIS WAS NOT OUR

819
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
INTENT.
WE WILL GET THIS FIXED AND CALL

IT IS WEIRD.

WHY AREN'T THEY JUST SAYING

I DON'T THINK SO.

830
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
THEY ARE TRYING TO SELL ADS AND

831
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
TO DO THAT BY PUTTING UP MY

832
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
PICTURE, THAT IS THE PRICE OF A

833
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
FREE SERVICE BUT IF THEY LICENSE

834
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
