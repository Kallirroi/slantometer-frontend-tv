BEHAVIOR, IS NOT THAT AT ALL.

186
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
>> Reporter: EVEN BEFORE THE

187
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
SHOOTING, ADAM LANZA, SEEN HERE

188
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
IN A PHOTO TAKEN SEVEN YEARS

189
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
AGO, WAS KNOWN IN THE

190
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
NEIGHBORHOOD AS A TROUBLED
CHILD, WITH AN OVERBEARING

191
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
MOTHER.

192
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
>> MY SON PLAYED WITH HIM WHEN

193
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
THEY WERE YOUNG.

194
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
AND IN HER HOME, I KNOW SHE WAS

195
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
VERY PARTICULAR.

196
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I JUST THINK SHE MAYBE HAD TOO

197
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
HIGH OF STANDARDS OR SOMETHING.

198
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
>> Reporter: ADAM'S FIRST VICTIM

199
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
WAS HIS MOTHER, NANCY, KILLED AT

200
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THE FAMILY HOME, ACCORDING TO

201
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
POLICE.

202
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
ONLY THEN DID HE HEAD ACROSS

203
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
TOWN TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

204
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
WHERE AUTHORITIES SAID HIS

205
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
MOTHER MAY HAVE ONCE SERVED AS A

206
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
VOLUNTEER OR A TEACHER'S AIDE.

207
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
>> THE CHILDREN DIDN'T HARM HIM.

208
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
BUT THEY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH

209
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
HIS MOTHER.

210
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
AND HIS MOTHER, I BELIEVE, MAY

211
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
BE REAL FOCUS OF ALL OF THIS.

212
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
>> Reporter: AUTHORITIES SAY

213
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
SHELL CASINGS RECOVERED AT THE

214
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
SCENE INDICATED HE USED A VERY

215
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
POWERFUL WEAPON AND AMMUNITION

216
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
223, IT'S CALLED, FAVORED AMONG

217
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
DEER HUNTERS BECAUSE IT DOES

218
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
MAXIMUM INTERNAL DAMAGE.

219
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
>> AND ALSO, THE BUSH MASTER,

220
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
THE RIFLE WE'RE TOLD HE WAS

221
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
FOUND WITH, A WEAPON COMMONLY

222
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
USED BY SOLDIERS

223
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ.

224
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
THAT GIVES YOU SOME INDICATION

225
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
OF THE FIREPOWER HE HAD.

226
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
BRIAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

227
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
WE'LL HEAR MORE ON THE
INVESTIGATION THAT GOES FORWARD.

228
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
>>> GEORGE, EARLIER, WITH STATE

229
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
POLICE ON HOW THE FAMILIES ARE

230
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
BEING NOTIFIED.
GEORGE?
>> THANKS, ELIZABETH.

231
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'M HERE WITH LIEUTENANT PAUL

232
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
VANCE OF THE STATE POLICE HERE

233
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
IN CONNECTICUT.

234
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
KEEPING PEOPLE INFORMED ALL

235
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THROUGH THE DAY YESTERDAY.

236
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
WE LEARNED OVERNIGHT THAT YOU

237
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
WERE ABLE TO NOTIFY ALL OF THE

238
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
FAMILIES.

239
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
>> OUR DETECTIVES MADE IT A

240
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
PRIORITY TO, IN FACT, IDENTIFY

241
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
ALL OF THE DECEASED VICTIMS, THE

242
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
CHILDREN, AND THE ADULTS, WITHIN

243
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THE FACILITY.

244
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
>> AND WHAT MORE HAVE YOU BEEN

245
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
ABLE TO LEARN ABOUT ADAM LANZA?

246
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
WHY AND HOW HE DID THIS?

247
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
>> THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S

248
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
GOING TO TAKE A SIGNIFICANT

249
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
AMOUNT OF TIME.

250
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
FROM THE ONSET, WE HAD TEAMS,

251
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
LOOKING INTO THE BACKGROUND,

252
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
PEELING THE ONION BACK, SO TO

253
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
SPEAK.

254
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
WE HAVE MANY, MANY QUESTIONS WE

255
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
NEED TO ASK AND WE NEED TO

256
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
EXPLORE.

257
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
>> THREE GUNS FOUND ON-SITE?

258
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
>> WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED THAT AS

259
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
OF YET.

260
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
IN EXCESS OF THREE GUNS.

261
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
>> MORE THAN THREE GUNS.

262
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
WE KNOW ALSO THAT THE GUNS MATCH

263
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
GUNS THAT HIS MOTHER MAY HAVE

264
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
HAD.
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO PUT THAT

265
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
TOGETHER YET?
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION

266
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
SPECIFICALLY.

267
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
>> DO YOU KNOW IF THEY WERE

268
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
OBTAINED LEGALLY.

269
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
>> THAT IS SOMETHING WE WOULD

270
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
ALSO EXPLORE IN THE

271
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
INVESTIGATION.

272
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
>> HOW ABOUT HOW ADAM LANZA

273
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
ACTUALLY GOT INTO THE SCHOOL.

274
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
THERE WERE SOME REPORTS THAT THE

275
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
PRINCIPAL MAY HAVE BUZZED HIM

276
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
IN.

277
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
>> I THINK THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY

278
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
PREMATURE.

279
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
WE DO HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA

280
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
HOW ENTRANCE WAS OBTAINED.

281
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
WE HAVE AN ADULT WITNESS THAT

282
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
WAS WOUNDED THAT SURVIVED, WHO

283
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
WILL BE INVALUABLE TO US.
>> WHY THIS SCHOOL?

284
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
>> WE DO HAVE SOME BACKGROUND

285
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
INFORMATION, THAT THERE WAS A

286
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL.

287
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THE SPECIFIC CONNECTION, I'D

288
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
RATHER NOT DIVULGE AND RATHER
NOT GET INTO RIGHT NOW.

289
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION OUT
THERE.

290
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
>> HIS MOM MAY HAVE BEEN A

291
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
TEACHER THERE AT SOME POINT?

292
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
>> FOR OUR PURPOSES, IT'S BETTER

293
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
WE EXPLORE THAT CONFIDENTLY FOR

294
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

295
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
>> I KNOW YOU'VE SPOKEN BOTH TO

296
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
HIS BROTHER AND HIS FATHER

297
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
OVERNIGHT.

298
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
WHAT WERE YOU ABLE TO LEARN FROM

299
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
THEM?

300
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
>> WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH LAW
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM OTHER

301
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
STATES, WHO ARE WORKING WITH US

302
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
ON THIS CASE, TO ASSIST US.

303
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
AND THEY HAVE EXTRACTED AND

304
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
OBTAINED INFORMATION THAT WAS

305
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
BENEFICIAL TO OUR INVESTIGATION.

306
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
>> ANY INDICATION THAT HE HAD

307
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
THREATENED TO KILL BEFORE?

308
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
>> THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT

309
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
SURFACED IMMEDIATELY.

310
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
THERE'S NONE WHATSOEVER.

311
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
>> ARE YOU CONFIDENT, NOW, THAT

312
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
HE ACTED ABSOLUTELY ALONE?

313
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
>> YEAH.

314
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
>> LIEUTENANT VANCE, THANK YOU

315
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING.

316
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
>>> AS WE JUST HEARD, THE NAMES

317
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
OF THE VICTIMS WILL BE RELEASED

318
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
LATER THIS MORNING, INCLUDING

319
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
ALL THOSE CHILDREN.

320
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
PRAYING FOR THEM LAST NIGHT,

321
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE PACKED INTO

322
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
CHURCHES IN THIS COMMUNITY.

323
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
ABC'S AMY ROBACH HAS MORE ON
THOSE VICTIMS.

324
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
GOOD MORNING, AMY.

325
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
>> GEORGE, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO

326
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
IMAGINE THE HORRIFIC REALITY

327
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
THAT SO MANY FAMILIES ARE WAKING

328
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
UP TO THIS MORNING.

329
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
THAT WHAT HAPPENED HERE LESS

330
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
THAN 24 HOURS AGO, ACTUALLY

331
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
HAPPENED.

332
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
AND THIS MORNING, WE ARE

333
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE TEACHERS

334
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
AND THE CHILDREN INSIDE THAT

335
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
SCHOOL WHO LOST THEIR LIVES.

336
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
DISTRAUGHT FAMILY AND FRIENDS

337
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
CAME TOGETHER TO MOURN, TO CRY

338
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
AND TO REMEMBER THE 27 LIVES
LOST HERE IN NEWTOWN,

339
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
CONNECTICUT.

340
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
>> I'M SO SORRY.
>> Reporter: OVERNIGHT, WE

341
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
LEARNED THE NAMES OF THOSE WE

342
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
LOST, AMONG THEM, 47-YEAR-OLD

343
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
DAWN HOCHSPRUNG.
AN AWARD-WINNING PRINCIPAL.

344
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
AND 27-YEAR-OLD VICKI SOTO, A
FIRST GRADE TEACHER, WHOSE FIRST

345
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
INSTINCT WAS TO PROTECT HER

346
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
STUDENTS, THROWING HERSELF IN
THE LINE OF FIRE.

347
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
20 OF 27 VICTIMS WERE STUDENTS

348
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

349
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
20 CHILDREN.

350
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
AND NOW, 20 FAMILIES MOURN

351
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
PRECIOUS LIVES LOST TOO SOON.

352
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
>> THIS SCARING EVENT, WILL BE

353
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
WITH US AND THEM FOR YEARS AND

354
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
YEARS TO COME.

355
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
>> Reporter: AND ACROSS THE

356
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
COUNTRY, AMERICA MOURNS.

357
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
AS PARENTS TRY TO EXPLAIN HOW A

358
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
NIGHTMARE BECAME A REALITY.

359
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN.

360
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
EXPERTS SAY THAT YOUR CHILDREN
DON'T HAVE TO HAVE BEEN HERE AT

361
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
THE SCENE TO BE TRAUMATIZED.

362
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
JUST HEARING AND LISTENING TO

363
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN

364
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
CONNECTICUT IS TRAUMATIC IN AND

365
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
OF ITSELF.

366
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
IF YOU HAVE LITTLE ONES, SHIELD

367
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
THEM FROM THIS COVERAGE.

368
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
AND YOUR OLDER ONES, YOU WANT TO

369
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
TALK TO THEM AND LET THEM

370
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
EXPRESS THEMSELVES.

371
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
GEORGE?

372
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
>> AMY, THANKS.

373
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
>>> I'M HERE, NOW, WITH JAMES

374
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
WILTSIE, THE COUSIN OF ANOTHER

375
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
VICTIM AND A HERO, VICKI SOTO, A

376
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL.

377
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

378
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
YOUR COUSIN, FROM WHAT WE KNOW,

379
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
DID EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO SAVE

380
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
THE LIVES OF SOME KIDS.

381
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
>> YES.

382
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
FROM WHAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD, MY

383
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
COUSIN, VICKI, AND HER FIRST

384
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
GRADE CLASSROOM, TOOK HER

385
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
STUDENTS AND HUDDLED THEM INTO A

386
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
CLOSET.

387
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
AND THEN, SHIELDED THE CHILDREN

388
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
IN THE CLOSET, TRYING TO PROTECT
THEM FROM BULLETS.

389
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
>> PUT HERSELF BETWEEN THE

390
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
GUNMAN AND THE KIDS.

391
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
>> YES.

392
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
SHE'S DEFINITELY A HERO.

393
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
HER LIFE DREAM WAS TO BE A

394
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
TEACHER.

395
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
AND HER INSTINCTS KICKED IN.

396
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
AND PROTECTED HER CHILDREN FROM

397
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
THE HARM THAT WAS COMING.
I'M SURE SHE HEARD WHAT WAS

398
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
GOING ON.

399
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
AND WENT INTO LOCKDOWN MODE.

400
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
TOOK HER KIDS, PUT THEM IN THE

401
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
CLOSET.

402
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
AND BY DOING SO, SHE LOST HER

403
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
LIFE PROTECTING THOSE LITTLE

404
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
ONES.

405
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
>> WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE

406
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
TO LEARN FROM THE POLICE OR

407
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
OTHERS ON THE SCENE?

408
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
>> JUST THAT SHE WAS A HERO.

409
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
THE WAY THAT SHE WAS FOUND,

410
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
HUDDLED OVER HER CHILDREN.

411
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
HER STUDENTS PROTECTING THEM.

412
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
YOU KNOW, DOING INSTINCTIVELY

413
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
WHAT SHE KNEW WOULD BE THE RIGHT

414
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
THING TO DO.

415
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
>>> GOOD MORNING.

432
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
ADAM LANZA AND THE SHOOTER'S

433
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
MOTHER, WHO APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN

434
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
THE MOTIVE FOR SPARKING THIS

435
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
DEADLY RAMPAGE.

436
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
ONCE THEY GO TO THE BANK OF

437
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
MICROPHONES, WE'LL TAKE THEM.

438
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
THIS HAS BEEN DEVASTATING NEWS

439
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
TO PROCESS.

440
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
A SMALL COMMUNITY INSIDE

441
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
CONNECTICUT.
THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HAD JUST

442
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
STARTED SCHOOL.

443
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER 9:30 IN THE

444
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
MORNING, WHEN THE GUNMAN ENTERED

445
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
THE SCHOOL.
A LOT OF QUESTIONS HOW ADAM

446
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
LANZA GAINED ENTRY, WHETHER

447
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
SOMEONE BUZZED IN TO LET HIM IN.

448
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
HE CAME IN, WE'RE TOLD, WITH AT

449
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
LEAST THREE WEAPONS.

450
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
USED THOSE WEAPONS TO OPEN FIRE

451
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
ON TWO DIFFERENT CLASSROOMS IN

452
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
WHICH TEACHERS AND CHILDRENS

453
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
WERE KILLED.

454
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
LET'S LISTEN IN.

455
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
>> WANT TO BRING YOU UP TO DATE

456
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
WITH THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE

457
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
WITH ME IS THE CHIEF OF POLICE

459
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000

460
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
AS YOU KNOW, THE VICTIMS HAVE

461
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
BEEN POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED BY

462
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF STATE'S

463
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER.
THEY'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF

464
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
DOING SOME OF THEIR WORK.

465
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
AS SOON AS THAT WORK IS

466
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
COMPLETED, WE WILL BE PREPARED

467
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000

THERE'S ONE, A COUPLE MAJOR

471
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
FACTORS, NUMBER ONE.

472
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
WHEN WE RELEASE THAT LIST, AND

SO, AGAIN, I WOULD ASK YOU, AND

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE SOME

507
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
QUESTIONS.
I JUST SIMPLY WANT YOU TO

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
UNDERSTAND THAT WE STILL HAVE

509
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
MAJOR CRIME DETECTIVES AND

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
NEWTOWN DETECTIVES WORKING AT

511
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
THE SCENE IN THE SCHOOL.

512
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
THAT IS NOT COMPLETED.

513
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
THAT PROBABLY WILL NOT BE

514
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
COMPLETED FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER

515
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
DAY AND A HALF TO TWO DAYS.

516
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
AND I'M PUTTING A TIME LIMIT ON

517
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
IT.

518
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
IT COULD TAKE LONGER.

519
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
AS I EXPLAINED TO YOU IN

520
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
PREVIOUS PRESS CONFERENCES WE'VE

521
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000

522
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
EXCLUDE THE OUTSIDE OF THE

528
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
BUILDING.
THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING IS

529
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
ALSO PART OF THE CRIME SCENE.

530
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
EVERY VEHICLE IN THAT LOT.

531
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG,

532
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
PAINSTAKING PROCESS.

533
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
WE HAVE THREE TEAMS, NOW.

534
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
THREE, MAJOR CRIME TEAMS IN THE

535
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
COMMUNITY.

536
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
OUR LOCAL PARTNERS ARE WORKING

537
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
WITH US.
WE'RE GOING TO EXPEDITE THAT

538
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
ALONG AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

539
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
WE HAD A MEETING THIS MORNING.

540
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
THAT WAS WITH SUPERINTENDENT OF

541
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
SCHOOLS.
SHE WILL BE, HOPEFULLY, IN THE

542
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE UP HERE

543
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000

544
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
THE ISSUES THAT SHE HAS

545
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
ENCOUNTERED.

546
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
THE MINUTE THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

547
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
IS DONE, AND I MEAN THAT

548
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
SINCERELY, THE MINUTE HE IS

549
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000

550
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
MUCH DETAILED INFORMATION AS WE

553
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
CAN, RELATIVE TO THE WORK THAT

554
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
HIS OFFICE DID, BOTH OVERNIGHT

555
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
AND CONTINUED TO DO AS WE SPEAK.

556
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
AS FAR AS ACTUAL, SPECIFIC

557
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
QUESTIONS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

558
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS WE'RE

559
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
HOLDING CLOSE TO OUR CHEST IN

560
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
THIS INVESTIGATION.
SO NOTHING IS TAKEN OUT OF

561
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
CONTEXT.
>> THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THERE

562
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
WERE OTHER GUNS FOUND IN THE

563
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
SCHOOL.
>> THAT'S NOT ACCURATE.

564
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
THE WEAPONRY THAT -- WASN'T

565
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
RECOVERED BY OUR INVESTIGATORS,

566
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
RECOVERED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF

567
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
THE DECEASED.

568
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
WE'RE INVESTIGATING THE HISTORY

569
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
OF EACH AND EVERY WEAPON.

570
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
WE WILL KNOW EVERY, SINGLE THING

571
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
ABOUT THOSE WEAPONS.

572
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I DON'T FOLLOW QUESTIONS ABOUT

573
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
WHO ARE THE OWNERS AND SO FORTH.

574
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
THAT'S ALL BEING DONE BY THE

575
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
INVESTIGATORS ASSIGNED TO THAT

576
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
TASK.

577
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
WE ARE, AGAIN, WE'RE GOING TO

578
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
ALLOW THE MEDICAL EXAMINER.

579
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
GOING TO WAIT FOR THE MEDICAL

580
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
EXAMINER TO PROVIDE THE

581
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
IDENTITIES OF THE SHOOTER, OF

582
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
ALL THE DECEASED IN THIS

583
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
INVESTIGATION.

584
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
>> THERE WERE ANY WRITINGS, ANY

585
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
E-MAILS, ANY MESSAGES, THAT

586
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
WOULD GIVE LIGHT TO A MOTIVE?

587
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
>> THAT'S A FAIR, GOOD QUESTION.

588
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
THE ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU ON

589
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
THAT IS, OUR INVESTIGATORS AT

590
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
THE CRIME SCENE, THE SCHOOL, AND

591
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
SECONDARILY AT THE SECONDARY

592
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
CRIME SCENE WHERE THE FEMALE IS

593
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
DECEASED, DID PRODUCE SOME VERY

594
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
GOOD EVIDENCE IN THIS

595
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
INVESTIGATION, THAT OUR

596
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
INVESTIGATORS WILL BE ABLE TO

597
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
USE AND HOPEFULLY PAINTING A

598
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
COMPLETE PICTURE AS TO HOW AND

599
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
MORE IMPORTANTLY WHY THIS

600
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
OCCURRED.

601
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
WE'RE NOT GOING TO NAME THE

602
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
EVIDENCE.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT

603
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
THE EVIDENCE.

604
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
IT'S SIMPLY STATED AS PART AND

605
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
PARCEL OF THE INVESTIGATION.

606
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT OUT OF

607
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
CONTEXT OF WHAT'S BEING DONE.

608
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A POINT OF

609
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
ENTRY.
I CAN TELL YOU IT WAS BELIEVED

610
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
HE WAS NOT VOLUNTARILY LET INTO

611
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
THE SCHOOL AT ALL.

612
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
THAT HE FORCED HIS WAY INTO THE

613
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
SCHOOL.
BUT THAT'S AS FAR AS WE CAN GO

614
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
ON THAT.

615
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
ARE THERE WHAT?

616
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
YEAH.
QUITE FRANKLY, THAT'S SOMETHING,

617
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
AGAIN, IF YOU TAKE IT OUT OF

618
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
CONTEXT, IT SOUNDS SUSPICIOUS.

619
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
BUT AS THE RESCUE CREWS ARRIVE,

620
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
THE ACTIVE SHOOTING TEAMS

621
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
ENTERED THE SCHOOL, THEY ENTERED

622
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
THE SCHOOL FROM SEVERAL

623
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
DIFFERENT POINTS AND IT

624
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
NECESSITATED FORCING THEIR WAY

625
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
TO GAIN ACCESS AND RESCUE AS

626
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
MANY STUDENTS AND FACULTY AS

627
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
THEY COULD.

628
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
HENCE, LAW ENFORCEMENT BROKE

629
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
MANY WINDOWS.

630
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
WHAT'S THAT?

631
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
THE OTHER CRIME SCENE?

632
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
YEAH, THE SECONDARY CRIME SCENE,

633
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
AS I TOLD YOU, WAS A CRIME

634
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
SCENE, DISCOVERED PURSUANT TO

635
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
THE INVESTIGATION.

636
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
ONCE WE HAD A POSITIVE IDENTI

637
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
IDENTIFICATION ON THE SUSPECT,

638
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
WE DID A GREAT DEAL OF WORK,

639
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
INCLUDING AND NOT LIMITED TO,

640
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
RELATIVES, FRIENDS, CO-WORKERS,

641
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
FORMER STUDENTS, LOCATION OF

642
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
RESIDENCE.

643
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
AND ALL THOSE AREAS HAD TO BE --

644
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
PEOPLE HAD TO BE INTERVIEWED.

645
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
AND ALL THOSE AREAS HAD TO BE

646
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
EXAMINED.

647
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
HENCE, THAT CAUSED US TO

648
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
DISCOVER THE SECONDARY CRIME

649
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
SCENE, WHICH WAS A SOLE

650
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
RESIDENCE WITH THE DECEASED.

651
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
THE DETECTIVES WILL CERTAINLY

652
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
ANALYZE EVERYTHING AND PUT A

653
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
COMPLETE PICTURE TOGETHER OF THE

654
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
EVIDENCE THAT THEY DID OBTAIN.

655
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
AND WE'RE HOPEFUL, WE'RE HOPEFUL

656
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
THAT IT WILL PAINT A COMPLETE

657
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
PICTURE OF HOW THIS ENTIRE

658
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
INCIDENT, UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT,
OCCURRED.

659
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'M SORRY?

660
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
SHE IS DOING FINE.

661
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
SHE HAS BEEN TREATED.

662
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
AND SHE'LL BE INSTRUMENT IN THIS

663
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
INVESTIGATION.

664
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND.

665
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
THAT, I DON'T KNOW.

666
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
THAT, I DON'T KNOW.

667
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
FORCED HIS WAY INTO THE SCHOOL.

668
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
THAT WOULD BE ACCURATE ACCORDING
TO INVESTIGATORS.

669
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
YES.

670
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I DON'T WANT TO BE TOO SPECIFIC

671
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
BECAUSE, QUITE FRANKLY, I DON'T

672
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
KNOW.
I WOULD SIMPLY -- I'VE BEEN

673
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
INFORMED THAT IT WAS FORCIBLY

674
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
ENTERED AND WAS NOT ALLOWED TO

675
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
ENTER, IF YOU WILL.

676
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS I'D LIKE

677
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
TO GET THE NEXT PORTION, IF YOU

678
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
WILL, OF TODAY.

679
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP YOU HERE

680
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
ALL DAY.

681
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I WANT TO DO THIS AS

682
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
EXPEDITIOUSLY AS I CAN.

683
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
WE WANT TO GET THE

684
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
SUPERINTENDENT, WANTS TO COME UP

685
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
WITH THE TOWN LEADERS, TO

686
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
DISCUSS CERTAIN AREAS OF HER

687
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
RESPONSIBILITY.
AND THEN, WE CERTAINLY WANT TO

688
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
GET THE MEDICAL EXAMINER UP

689
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
HERE.

690
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
AGAIN, WE'LL DO THAT AS QUICKLY

691
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO GET THE

692
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
LIST OF THE I.D.s AND ALL OF THE

693
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
INFORMATION OUT TO YOU.

694
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
FOR ANY OF YOU THAT ARE NEW HERE

695
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
TODAY, THE LIEUTENANT AND I PUT

696
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
TOGETHER A WRITTEN PRESS

697
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
RELEASE.
WE'LL PROVIDE THOSE TO YOU AT MY

698
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
VEHICLE.

699
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
PLEASE, DON'T RUSH MY VEHICLE.

700
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
WE SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH FOR

701
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
EVERYONE.

702
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
IF NOT, WE'LL BRING MORE THE

703
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
NEXT TIME WE COME OUT.

704
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
AND IT LAYS OUT THE BASIC

705
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
DETAILS OF EVERYTHING, LEADING

706
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
UP UNTIL TODAY.

707
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
ALL RIGHT?

708
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
WE WILL TRY -- I DON'T WANT TO

709
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
GIVE YOU A TIME.

710
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
WE'LL TRY TO BE BACK HERE, I'LL

711
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
SAY WITHIN THE HOUR.

712
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'LL MAKE NOTIFICATION TO SOME

713
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
OF YOU THAT I CAN THAT WE'RE ON

714
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
THE WAY.
>> DID THE MOTHER HAVE ANY

715
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
CONNECTIONS TO THE SCHOOL?

716
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
>> YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT

717
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
AFTER THE SHOOTING, WE DID A

718
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
COMPLETE AND THOROUGH SEARCH OF

719
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
THE AREA, THE ENTIRE

720
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
NEIGHBORHOOD, WITH OUR LOCAL

721
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
PARTNERS.

722
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
EVERYTHING WAS EXAMINED.

723
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
IF WE FOUND ANYONE THAT WAS IN

724
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
THE WOODS, CUTTING WOOD, THAT

725
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
WOULD BE DETAINED, PENDING THE

726
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
INVESTIGATION.

727
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
THERE WERE NO OTHER ARRESTS THAT

728
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS

729
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
INVESTIGATION THAT OCCURRED.

730
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE MINDSET OF --

731
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
>> I WOULD HAVE YOU ADDRESS THAT

732
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

733
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
SCHOOLS.
OKAY?

734
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
SHE CAN GIVE YOU THAT ANSWER.

735
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
WE WILL BE BACK.

736
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I NEED TO GET -- IF I DON'T GET

737
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
HERE, WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE

738
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
QUITE SOME TIME.

739
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF

740
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
QUESTIONS.

741
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
AND I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

742
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
COMING HERE, THAT WE'RE BRINGING

743
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
HERE TO SPEAK TO YOU, CAN ANSWER

744
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
THESE QUESTIONS AND TAKE A LOT

745
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
OF THE MYSTERY OUT OF WHAT WE'VE

746
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
BEEN DEALING WITH FOR THE LAST
24 HOURS.

747
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
OKAY?
WE WILL BE BACK.

748
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
>> AND LIEUTENANT PAUL VANCE

749
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
FROM CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE,

750
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
WRAPPING UP HIS PRESS

751
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
CONFERENCE.
SOME NEWS EMERGING THERE.

752
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
FIRST OF ALL, THEY HAVE

753
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED ALL OF THE

754
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
VICTIMS.
REMEMBER, 20 OF THEM, YOUNG

755
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
CHILDREN, ALTHOUGH THEY'RE

756
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
RELEASING THE LIST OF THOSE

757
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
NAMES, WHICH I'M SURE LOOKS LIKE

758
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
A KINDERGARTNER OR FIRST GRADE

759
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
CLASS LIST, WITH THE NAMES AND

760
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
AGES OF BIRTH.
PLEADING WITH THE MEDIA TO GIVE

761
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
THOSE FAMILIES PRIVACY.

762
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
THOSE FAMILIES GRIEVING AN

763
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
UNIMAGINABLE LOSS AT THIS POINT.
A HOTLINE NUMBER TO ANYBODY

764
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
NEEDING THERAPY, COUNSELING OVER

765
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
THE PHONE.

766
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
ALSO, THIS IS KEY.
ALL OF THE WEAPONS WERE

767
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
APPARENTLY FOUND INSIDE THE

768
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
SCHOOL NEAR THE BODY OF THE
SHOOTER.

769
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
AT LEAST THREE WEAPONS.
THERE'S BEEN GOOD EVIDENCE FOR A

770
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
MOTIVE FOR THE SHOOTING THAT WAS

771
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
FOUND AT THE VICTIM'S HOME THAT

772
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
HE APPARENTLY SHARED WITH HIS

773
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
MOTHER, WHERE HE HAS APPARENTLY,

774
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
BEFORE GOING TO THE SCHOOL AND

775
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
OPENING FIRE ON ALL THOSE

776
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
CHILDREN, KILLED HIS MOTHER BY

777
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
FIRING ON HER AT POINT-BLANK

778
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
RANGE.

779
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
ALSO, EVIDENCE THAT HE FORCED

780
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
HIS WAY INTO THE ELEMENTARY

781
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
SCHOOL AFTER SPECULATION THAT,

782
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
PERHAPS, HE HAD BEEN BUZZED IN.

783
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
AND THAT FINALLY, THE SOLE

784
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
SURVIVOR IN THE SHOOTING, ONE

785
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
PERSON SURVIVED, THAT SHOOTING.

786
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
WILL BE CRUCIAL TO THE

787
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
INVESTIGATION GOING FORWARD.

788
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
SHE IS DOING FINE.

789
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
OBVIOUSLY, WILL HAVE VALUABLE

790
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
EVIDENCE FOR POLICE GOING

791
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000

797
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
>>> IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE

798
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
HAPPENED TO OUR CHILDREN.

799
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
THEY WERE VERY LITTLE.

800
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000

801
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
20 CHILDREN DEAD.
THE WORST SHOOTING EVER AT A

806
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
GRADE SCHOOL HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES.

807
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
THE GUNMAN, ADAM LANZA, WAS 20

808
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
YEARS OLD.

809
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
HE SHOT HIS MOTHER BEFORE COMING

810
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
TO THE SCHOOL TO SHOOT SO MANY

811
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
CHILDREN, ADULTS, AS WELL.

812
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
AS I SAID, THE DEADLIEST GRADE

813
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING EVER IN OUR

814
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
HISTORY.

815
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
AND, ELIZABETH, SO MANY PEOPLE

816
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
HERE HAVING SUCH A HARD TIME

817
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
COMING TO GRIPS WITH THIS PAIN.
>> IT'S UNIMAGINABLE, GEORGE.

818
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I THINK EVERY PARENT WHEN THEY

819
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
HEARD THIS STORY BREAK, JUST WAS

820
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
IN SHOCK.

821
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I FELT, I KNOW, PHYSICALLY SICK

822
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
TO MY STOMACH.

823
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE FELT THE

824
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
SAME WAY.

825
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
AND COMING UP IN THIS HALF HOUR,
WE'RE GOING TO WEIGH IN WITH

826
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
EXPERTS ON HOW TO TALK TO OUR

827
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
KIDS ABOUT THIS TRAGEDY, ABOUT

828
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
THE SHOOTINGS.

829
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
THEY WILL, OF COURSE, HEAR ABOUT

830
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
THAT.

831
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
IT VARIES WITH THE AGE.

832
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
IT VARIES WITH THE CHILD.

833
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
BUT THE EXPERTS HAVE GREAT

834
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
ADVICE.
IT'S ALL IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE

835
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
OUR KIDS FEEL SAFE, EVEN AS THEY

836
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
LEARN ABOUT THIS HORRIFIC

837
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
MASSACRE, IN NEWTOWN, WHERE

838
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
YOU'RE STANDING, GEORGE.

839
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

840
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
IT'S SO HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW

841
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO
KNOW.

842
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I'M HERE WITH DAN HARRIS, WHO

843
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
HAS BEEN HERE FROM THE VERY

844
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
BEGINNING.

845
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
WE'RE GOING TO LEARN ALL OF THE

846
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
IDENTITIES OF THE VICTIMS THIS

847
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
MORNING.

848
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
>> WE'RE EXPECTING THAT THIS

849
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
MORNING IN A PRESS CONFERENCE

850
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
COMING UP.

851
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS

852
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
POINT.

853
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
WE'RE SEEING A MASSIVE

854
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
INVESTIGATION UNFOLD.
AT THE HEART OF THIS POLICE

855
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
INVESTIGATION RIGHT NOW IS THIS
QUESTION.

856
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
WHY?
WHAT WAS THE MOTIVE OF THE

857
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
SUSPECT, 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA?
WE KNOW HIS RAMPAGE BEGAN WITH

THE MURDER OF HIS MOTHER HERE IN

859
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
NEWTOWN.
HE THEN STORMED THE SANDY HOOK

860
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE HE

861
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
KILLED 20 CHILDREN, MANY OF THEM

862
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
FIRST GRADERS AND SIX ADULTS.

863
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
POLICE SAY HIS MOM HAD SOME SORT

864
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
OF CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL.

865
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
BUT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT.

866
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
SHE MAY HAVE WORKED THERE AT
SOME POINT.

867
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
POLICE TELL US THEY'VE BEEN

868
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000

HIS FATHER AND OLDER BROTHER.

871
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
WE KNOW HE USED AT LEAST THREE

872
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
WEAPONS.

873
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
THREE OF THEM SEMIAUTOMATIC.

874
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
ONE OF THEM A RIFLE.

875
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
OVERNIGHT, POLICE IDENTIFIED THE

HORRIFYING TASK OF NOTIFYING THE

878
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000

A WOMAN THAT RELATIVES SAY, WAS

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
A MOM WHO WOULD HAVE DONE
ANYTHING TO HELP HER SON IF SHE

896
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
KNEW HE NEEDED HELP.

897
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
AS NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, IS

898
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000

AUTHORITIES TOLD ABC NEWS, THEIR

919
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
MOTHER, NANCY LANZA, WAS FOUND

920
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
FATALLY SHOT IN HER CONNECTICUT
HOME.

921
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
>> SHE RAISED VERY NICE BOYS, TO

922
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
ME.

923
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S A SHOCK
TO EVEN KNOW THEM AND REALIZE

924
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
WHO THEY ARE.
AND WHAT HE DID.

925
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
>> Reporter: STATE RECORDS

926
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
INDICATE SHE WAS DIVORCED FROM

927
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
HER HUSBAND IN 2009.

928
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
BOTH NANCY AND HER EX-HUSBAND,

929
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
PETER LANZA, WERE REQUIRED TO

930
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
COMPLETE A PARENTING EDUCATION

931
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
PROGRAM, NECESSARY FOR DIVORCED

932
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
COUPLES WITH CHILDREN UNDER 18.

933
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
>> I THINK THE FACT THAT THE

934
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
PARENTS WERE DIVORCED MUST HAVE

935
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
CONTRIBUTED TO IT.

936
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
>> Reporter: THE SHOOTER'S

937
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
FATHER, PETER LANZA, IS A VICE

938
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
PRESIDENT AT G.E. CAPITAL, AND

939
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
HAD BEEN A PARTNER AT ERNST &

940
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
YOUNG, WHERE HIS SON, RYAN,

941
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
WORKS NOW.

942
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
HE IS NOW REMARRIED AND WAS
QUESTIONED BY AUTHORITIES.

943
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
BUT IS NOT UNDER ANY SUSPICION.

944
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THE MOTHER WHO LIVED HERE ON

945
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
THIS STREET, WAS -- HAD SOME

946
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL, WE'RE
TOLD.
BUT THE SUPERINTENDENT SAID,

947
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
THIS MORNING, THAT SHE WAS NOT

948
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
OFFICIALLY EMPLOYED THERE.

949
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
SHE MAY HAVE VOLUNTEERED IN SOME

950
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
WAY.
AS FOR THE FATHER, THEY'RE

951
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
DIVORCED.
HE DOESN'T LIVE HERE.

952
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
HE LIVES IN STANFORD.

953
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
AND HE APPARENTLY FOUND OUT

954
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
ABOUT THE KILLING FROM A

955
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
REPORTER WHO WAS IN HIS DRIVEWAY

956
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
WHEN HE CAME HOME AND INFORMED

957
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
HIM.
ELIZABETH?

958
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
>> ALL RIGHT, JIM.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

959
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
>>> THE QUESTION GOES TO WHAT

960
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
WOULD MAKE A PERSON DO SOMETHING

961
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
LIKE THIS?

962
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
SOMETHING SO TERRIFIC TO

963
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
CHILDREN SO LITTLE.

964
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
LET'S BRING IN PSYCHIATRIST

965
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
DR. JANET TAYLOR TO TALK ABOUT

966
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
THE MIND OF THE SHOOTER.

967
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
CLEARLY, EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS

968
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
THIS YOUNG MAN WAS MENTALLY ILL.

969
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
BUT TO PICK CHILDREN, YOUNG,

970
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
YOUNG CHILDREN, AS HIS VICTIMS.

971
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I MEAN, THAT IS ABOUT THE WORST

972
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
THING YOU COULD DO.

973
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT

974
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
HIS MOTIVATION?

975
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
ABOUT HIS STABILITY OR

976
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
INSTABILITY, OBVIOUSLY?

977
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
>> CERTAINLY, THERE IS AN EVIL

978
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
JUST HEINOUS QUALITY TO IT.

979
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
AND THE FACT IS, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

980
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
TO PREDICT WHO WILL BE VIOLENT.

981
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
BUT RISK FACTORS ARE,

982
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN

983
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
EXPOSED TO PHYSICAL ABUSE,

984
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
SEXUAL ABUSE.

985
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
IF THERE'S AN UNDERLYING

986
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPAIRMENT, WHICH

987
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
CERTAINLY HE WAS DESCRIBED AS

988
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
ODD AND POSSIBLY IN THE AUTISM

989
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
SPECTRUM.

990
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO GUNS AND

991
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
WEAPONS.

992
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
AND CERTAINLY, INDIVIDUALS WHO

993
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
MAY HAVE REVENGE IN THEIR MIND.

994
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
BUT AGAIN, WHO WANTS TO HURT

995
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
INNOCENT CHILDREN?

996
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
>> OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S A LOT OF

997
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT ARE

998
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
AUTISTIC OR HAVE ASPERGER'S
SYNDROME AND NEVER COMMIT ANY

999
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
VIOLENT ACT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO, FRANKLY,

1000
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
ARE MENTALLY ILL.

1001
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
A QUARTER OF THE POPULATION, BY

1002
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
SOME ESTIMATES, ARE MENTALLY ILL

1003
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
AND NEVER COMMIT A VIOLENT ACT.

1004
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
THIS YOUNG MAN, ACCORDING TO

1005
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
POLICE, IS SHOOTING HIS MOTHER

1006
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
AT HIS HOME, AND GETTING IN THE

1007
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
CAR WITH HIS WEAPONS, DRIVING TO

1008
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, WALKING IN

1009
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
AND SHOOTING KINDERGARTNERS AND

1010
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
FIRST GRADERS.

1011
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
>> I THINK THE PREMEDITATIVE

1012
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
QUALITY OF IT CERTAINLY

1013
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
INDICATES A FACT THAT YOU CAN BE

1014
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
MENTALLY ILL.

1015
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
YOU CAN BE PSYCHOTIC AND KNOW

1016
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
RIGHT FROM AMONG.
AND THIS CASE, I THINK HE

1017
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
DELIBERATELY KNEW WHAT HE WAS

1018
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
DOING.

1019
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
CERTAINLY, HIS UNDERLYING MENTAL
ILLNESS, PRESUMABLY THAT HE HAD,

1020
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
WAS NOT AN EXCUSE IN ANY WAY FOR

1021
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
A WHAT HE DID.

1022
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
>> OBVIOUSLY, THE FACT THAT THE

1023
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
TARGET WAS YOUNG CHILDREN.

1024
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
DOES THAT GIVE YOU ANY

1025
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
INDICATION OF PERHAPS HE WAS

1026
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
TRYING TO HURT SOMETHING THAT

1027
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
MEANT SOMETHING TO HIS MOTHER?
>> I MEAN, PRESUMABLY THAT WOULD

1028
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
BE THE LINK.

1029
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
UNFORTUNATELY, WE WILL NOT KNOW.

1030
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT THE

1031
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
FACT HE KILLED HIS MOTHER AND

1032
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
THEN WENT AND KILLED INNOCENT

1033
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
CHILDREN, MAYBE THERE'S A LINK

1034
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
BETWEEN HIS MOTHER AND THE KIDS.

1035
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
OR MAYBE HE JUST FELT LIKE HE

1036
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
WAS DOING SOMETHING SO HORRIFIC

1037
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
THAT HE WOULD ALWAYS BE

1038
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
REMEMBERED.
WE WON'T KNOW.

1039
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE HAVE

1040
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
TO PRAY FOR THE FAMILIES AND

1041
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
UNDERSTAND THAT AT SOME POINT,

1042
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
WE WILL UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVE.

1043
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
BUT IT STILL WILL NEVER BE

1044
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
ENOUGH TO BRING THE POOR KIDS

1045
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
AND ADULTS WHO DIED BACK.

1046
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000

1047
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000

HELP RELIEVE THE PAIN

1273
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
AND STOP THE DAMAGE

1274
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
FOR MANY ADULTS WITH
MODERATE TO SEVERE RA,

1275
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
HUMIRA IS CLINICALLY PROVEN
TO HELP RELIEVE PAIN

AND STOP JOINT DAMAGE.

1277
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
SO YOU CAN TREAT MORE
THAN JUST THE PAIN.

1278
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
HUMIRA CAN LOWER YOUR
ABILITY TO FIGHT INFECTIONS,

1279

INCLUDING TUBERCULOSIS.

1285
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
BEFORE STARTING HUMIRA, YOUR
DOCTOR SHOULD TEST YOU FOR TB.

1286
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU LIVE
IN OR HAVE BEEN TO A REGION

1287

WHERE CERTAIN FUNGAL
INFECTIONS ARE COMMON.

OR HAVE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS

FEVER, FATIGUE, COUGH, OR SORES.

1291
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
YOU SHOULD NOT START HUMIRA IF
YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF INFECTION.

1292
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
ASK YOUR RHEUMATOLOGIST ABOUT
HUMIRA, TO HELP RELIEVE PAIN

1293

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION NOT CAUSED
BY A HEART VALVE PROBLEM,

1377

FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN,

AND MADE A MONTHLY TRIP TO THE
CLINIC TO GET HIS BLOOD TESTED.

1382

BUT NOT ANYMORE.

1383

THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE

XARELTO® IS PROVEN EFFECTIVE

TO REDUCE THE RISK
OF AN AFIB-RELATED STROKE.

THERE IS LIMITED DATA
ON HOW THESE DRUGS COMPARE

NO ROUTINE BLOOD MONITORING

1395
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000

WITHOUT TALKING TO THE DOCTOR
WHO PRESCRIBES IT FOR YOU.

IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE
ABNORMAL BLEEDING.

XARELTO® CAN CAUSE BLEEDING,
WHICH CAN BE SERIOUS,

1413
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
AND RARELY MAY LEAD TO DEATH.

1414
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
YOU ARE LIKELY TO BRUISE
MORE EASILY ON XARELTO®,

1415
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
AND IT MAY TAKE LONGER
FOR BLEEDING TO STOP.

1416

TELL YOUR DOCTORS
YOU ARE TAKING XARELTO®
