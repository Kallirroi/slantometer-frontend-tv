1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
CLAIRE: IT'S PARTY

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
NIGHT, AND THAT USUALLY
MEANS A NIGHT THAT'S FUN

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
FOR EVERYONE BUT THE

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
HOST.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
TODAY, I'VE GOT SOME

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
SIMPLE SOLUTIONS TO GET

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
SOME IMPRESSIVE PLATES

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
TO THE PARTY WITHOUT ALL

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
THE STRESS.

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I LOVE THROWING PARTIES,

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
BUT THEY CAN BE A LOT OF

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
HARD WORK.

13
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
LUCKILY, I HAVE SOME

14
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
GREAT RECIPES THAT ARE

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
REALLY EASY TO MULTIPLY,

16
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
AND I'VE TESTED THEM OUT

17
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
ON MY FRIENDS, SO I KNOW

18
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
THAT THEY WILL FLY OFF

19
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
THE TABLE.

20
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'M STARTING WITH ONE OF

21
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
MY FAVORITE PARTY BITES,

22
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
MY SMASHED PEA AND

23
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
RICOTTA CROSTINI.

24
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS

25
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
DISH IS THAT IT'S SO

26
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
COLORFUL, SO IT'SFUL, AS WES

27
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
BEAUTIFUL, AS WELL AS

28
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
DELICIOUS.

29
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
IT'S ALSO A FAMILY
FAVORITE.

30
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY

31
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
LOVE IT.

32
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
AND WHEN YOU'RE THROWING
A PARTY, IT'S IMPORTANT

33
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
TO REMEMBER THAT VISUALS

34
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS

35
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
FLAVOR.

36
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
SO, LET'S GET STARTED.

37
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I HAVE MY WATER COMING

38
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
UP TO A BOIL.

39
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'M GOING TO ADD A

40
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
COMBINATION OF SALT AND

41
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
SUGAR.

42
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
THIS IS GOING TO MAKE
SURE THAT MY PEAS ARE

43
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
PERFECTLY SEASONED.

44
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
AND I'M ADDING SUGAR,

45
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
BECAUSE IT REALLY
EMPHASIZES THE NATURAL

46
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
SWEETNESS OF THE PEAS.

47
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'M USING FROZEN PEAS,

48
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
AND THE GREAT THING
ABOUT FROZEN IS THEN YOU

49
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
HAVE ACCESS TO

50
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
DELICIOUS-TASTING PEAS

51
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
ALL YEAR ROUND; PLUS,

52
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
IT'S SUPER CONVENIENT.

53
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
AND I'M JUST GOING TO

54
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
COOK THEM FOR ABOUT TWO

55
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
TO THREE MINUTES UNTIL

56
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
THEY GET NICE AND BRIGHT

57
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
GREEN.
MY PEAS LOOK DONE.

58
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL,

59
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
THEY'RE BRIGHT, AND THEY

60
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
STILL HAVE THAT REALLY

61
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
NICE ROUNDNESS TO THEM.

62
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
YOU DON'T EY'RE
PUCKERED

63
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
LOOK LIKE THEY'RE
PUCKERED IN.

64
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
THAT MEANS THEY'RE
OVERCOOKED.

65
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
SO, I'M JUST GOING TO
DRAIN THESE OFF.

66
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
ALL RIGHT.

67
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
TO PUT THIS TOGETHER,

68
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'M GOING TO PUT ALL OF
MY INGREDIENTS IN THE

69
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
FOOD PROCESSOR, STARTING

70
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
WITH MY PEAS.

71
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
NEXT, I'M GOING TO ADD

72
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
MY RICOTTA AND THEN JUST

73
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A LITTLE BIT OF MINT..

74
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
SO, I'M GOING TOLIGHTLY CHO.

75
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S

76
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
GOING IN A FOOD
PROCESSOR, I'M CHOPPING

77
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
THIS, BECAUSE I DON'T

78
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
REALLY WANT TO OVER

79
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
PROCESS IT.

80
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I WANT SOMETHING THAT'S

81
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
REALLY DELICIOUS AND

82
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
WELL-BLENDED, BUT NOT

83
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
BABY FOOD.

84
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
WELL, MY MINT LOOKS

85
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
READY.

86
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'M JUST GOING TO ADD
ABOUT TWO TEASPOONS OF

87
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
THIS -- NOT A LOT -- I

88
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
JUST WANT A HINT OF THE

89
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
MINT.

90
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
NEXT, I'M GOING TO ADD A

91
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
PINCH OF WHITE PEPPER.

92
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I HAVE A LOT OF DELICATE

93
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
FLAVORS HAPPENING IN

94
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
THIS CROSTINI, SO I LIKE

95
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
USING WHITE PEPPER,

96
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
OVERPOWER IT.

97
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
SO, I'M JUST GOING TO
LIGHTLY PULSE IT.

98
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I DO NOT WANT TO

99
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
OVER-BLEND THIS OR PUREE

100
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
IT.

101
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
THAT IS IT.

102
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I DO NOT WANT TO DO

103
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
ANYTHING ELSE TO THIS.

104
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'M GOING

105
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'M GOING TO ADJUST IT A

106
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
LITTLE BIT.
I'M GOING TO TASTE IT,

107
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
SEE IF IT NEEDS ANY SALT

108
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
AND PEPPER, AND THEN

109
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
MAYBE PULSE IT JUST ONE
TO TWO MORE

110
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
LET'S GIVE IT A TASTE,

111
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
SEE IF IT NEEDS ANY
ADJUSTMENT.

112
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
MM, THAT IS SUPER TASTY.

113
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I LOVE WHITE PEPPER,

114
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
THOUGH, SO I'M JUST

115
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
GOING TO ADD A LITTLE

116
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
BIT MORE.
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO

117
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
REMEMBER THAT I ALREADY

118
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
SEASONED MY PEAS, WHEN I

119
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
BOILED THEM, WITH SALT

120
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
AND SUGAR; SO I DON'T

121
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
HAVE TO REALLY ADD

122
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
ANYMORE SALT.

123
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
ALL RIGHT, JUST A COUPLE

124
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
OF PULSES TO BLEND THEM
TOGETHER.

125
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
WELL, THIS LOOKS GREAT.

126
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'M GOING TO GET IT INTO

127
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
A BOWL AND THEN WORK ON

128
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
THE REST OF MY CROSTINI.

129
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
MY PEAS ARE DONE, SO NOW.

130
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'M GOING TO MOVE OVER

131
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
TO MSO NOW.

132
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
CROSTINI JUST MEANS

133
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
TOAST, AND IT'S A

134
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
WONDERFUL THING TO USE

135
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
IN A PARTY, BECAUSE YOU

136
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
CAN MULTIPLY IT BY JUST

137
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
ADDING MORE BREAD, AND

138
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
GUESTS LOVE IT, BECAUSE

139
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
YOU DON'T GET YOUR
FINGERS MESSY WHEN YOU

140
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
EAT IT.

141
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
TO MAKE MY CROSTINI, IT

142
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
COULD NOT BE EASIER.

143
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'M GOING TO SLICE MY

144
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
BREAD PRETTY THIN.

145
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I WANT IT TO BE EASY TO

146
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
BITE THROUGH AND ON A

147
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
BIAS, SO I GET LARGER

148
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
SLICES.

149
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
YOU CAN SEE I SLICED

150
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THESE PRETTY THIN, AND

151
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
IT'S BECAUSE I DON'T

152
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
WANT MY GUESTS TO GET A

153
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
BIG BITE OF TOAST.

154
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE

155
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
IN BALANCE.

156
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
SO NOW I'M JUST GOING TO

157
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
DRIZZLE THEM WITH A
LITTLE BIT OF OLIVE OIL.

158
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THIS GIVES THEM A REALLY
NICE COLOR AND CRISPS

159
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
THEM UP REALLY WELL.

160
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
NOW I'M JUST GOING TO

161
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
POP THEM IN THE OVEN
UNTIL THEY TURN A NICE

162
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
GOLDEN BROWN.

163
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
MY CROSTINI ARE DONE, SO

164
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'M GOING TO PUT ONE

165
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
TOGETHER AND GIVE IT A

166
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
TASTE.

167
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
YOU DON'T NEED A LOT;

168
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
JUST ONE SPOONFUL WILL

169
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
TOTALLY DO.

170
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
AND THEN I LIKE TO

171
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
FINISH THEM WITH A

172
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
FRAICHE, WHICH IS
FRAICHE, WHICH IS JUST

173
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
FRENCH SOUR CREAM, AND

174
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
IT'S A LITTLE BIT

175
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THINNER, SO IT DRIZZLES

176
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
REALLY WELL.

177
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
YOU CAN ALWAYS ADD A

178
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
TOUCH OF MILK TO REGULAR
SOUR CREAM TO GET A

179
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
SIMILAR CONSISTENCY.

180
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO

181
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
GIVE IT A TRY.

182
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
MM, THAT IS THE PERFECT

183
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
PARTY BITE.

184
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
IT IS SO GOOD.

185
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I LOVE THE COMBINATION

186
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
OF THE CRUNCHY CROSTINI

187
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
WITH THE CREAMY SMASHED

188
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
PEAS AND THEN THE LITTLE

189

WHILE MY TOMATOES ARE
ROASTING IN THE OVEN,

260
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'M GOING TO GET STARTED

261
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
ON MY CANNELLINI BEANS,

262
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000

263
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
THEY HAVE A REALLY

264
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
BUTTERY, MEATY, HEARTY

265
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
FLAVOR THAT IS SO

266
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
DELICIOUS.

267
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
AND I'M DOING SOMETHING
A LITTLE DIFFERENT WITH

268
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
THEM TODAY.

269
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I AM SAUTEEING THEM, SO

270
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'M GOING TO GIVE THEM A

271
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
REALLY DELICIOUS SORT OF

272
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
BLISTERED, GOLDEN BROWN

273
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
TEXTURE ON THE OUTSIDE,

274
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
BUT STILL WITH THAT

275
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
REALLY TENDER BITE ON

276
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
THE INSIDE.

277
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
SO, I'M GOING TO GET
STARTED.

278
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I HAVE MY PAN HERE OVER

279
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000

280
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'M GOING TO ADD JUST A

281
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
NEXT, I'M ADDING MY

283
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
GARLIC, AND I USUALLY

284
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
DON'T ADD GARLIC

285
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
STRAIGHT INTO OIL,

286
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
BECAUSE IT CAN BURN

287
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
REALLY EASILY, BUT I

288
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
REALLY WANT TO GET THAT

289
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
OIL FLAVOR WITH THE

290
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
ADD IT IN BUT REALLY

292
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
WATCH IT.

293
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
NEXT, I'M ADDING MY

294
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
CHILI FLAKES JUST FOR A

295
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
LITTLE BIT OF HEAT.

296
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
AND WITH THE GARLIC AND

297
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
CHILI, YOU CAN ADD AS

298
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
MUCH OR AS LITTLE AS YOU

299
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
LIKE.

300
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
SO, I'M JUST GOING TO
LET THIS COOK UNTIL IT'S

301
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
BARELY TOASTED.

302
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD,

303
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
AND IT SMELLS AMAZING.

304
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
SO NOW I'M JUST GOING TO

305
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
ADD MY BEANS STRAIGHT

306
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
IN, AND I'M GOING TO

307
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
STIR THEM AROUND TO MAKE

308
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
SURE THEY'RE FULLY
COATED.

309
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I WOULD TYPICALLY USE

310
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
DRY CANNELLINI BEANS,

311
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
BECAUSE THEN I CAN COOK

312
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
PARTY NIGHT, AND I'M

313
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000

318
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
FLAVOR ON TOP OF THE

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
CANNELLINI BEANS.

320
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
SO, I JUST TURNED UP THE
HEAT A LITTLE BIT, AND

321
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'M GOING TO LET THESE

322
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
SIT UNDISTURBED FOR A

323
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
MINUTE OR TWO, JUST TO
MAKE SURE THEY GET NICE

324
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
AND GOLDEN BROWN

325
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000

327
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
JUST GOING TO FLIP THEM

328
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
AND LET THEM COOK FOR

329
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
JUST A LITTLE BIT
LONGER.

330
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
AND YOU REALLY WANT TO
COOK THEM WELL, BECAUSE

331
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
YOU WANT THAT REALLY

332
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
GOLDEN BROWN, ALMOST

333
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000

339
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
AND MY ROASTED CHERRY

340
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
TOMATOES SHOULD BE READY

341
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
BY NOW, SO I'M GOING TO

342
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
PULL THAT OUT OF THE
OVEN.

343
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
THOSE LOOK BEAUTIFUL!

344
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
SO NOW I'M JUST GOING TO

345
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
PUT MY PLATTER TOGETHER.

346
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
FIRST, I HAVE MY FRESH

CHIFFONADE MY BASIL.

352
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
SO, I JUST LIKE TO STACK

353
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
IT ON TOP AND THEN ROLL

354
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
IT UP AND SLICE IT

355
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000

TOMATOES, AND I'M DOING

365
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
CAN BE A LITTLE

367
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
DELICATE.

368
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
ALSO, I LOVE THE FLAVOR

369
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000

SPOTS TASTE KIND OF
CARAMELIZED.

WHAT IN THE WORLD IS HAPPENING

TO US?

776
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
72 MILLION OF US ARE OVERWEIGHT

OR OBESE.

778
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
THERE'S EPIDEMIC DIABETES AMONG

779
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
OUR KIDS.

780
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
WE'RE GETTING SICK AND DYING

781
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
FROM EATING TOO MANY FOODS THAT

782
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
ARE OVERPROCESSED, LOW IN

783
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
NUTRIENTS AND FIBER AND HIGH IN

784
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
FAT AND CALORIES.

785
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
>> WHEN I WEIGHED 360 POUNDS,

786
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE OLD ADAGE,

787
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
"YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT," AND I

788
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
WAS EATING GARBAGE AND MY HEALTH

789
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
WAS GARBAGE.

790
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
AND WHEN I CHANGED HOW I ATE AND

791
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
HOW I TREATED MY BODY, MY ENTIRE

792
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
HEALTH CHANGED.

793
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I THINK THE REASON THAT A LOT OF

794
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
PEOPLE DON'T EAT HEALTHY IS

795
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONVENIENT, AND

796
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT THE

797
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
NINJA IS IT MAKES IT CONVENIENT.
