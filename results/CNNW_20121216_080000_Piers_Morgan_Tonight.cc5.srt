BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS ENORMOUS

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
TRAGEDY.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
NO WORDS CAN TRULY EXPRESS HOW

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
HEARTBROKEN WE ARE.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
HE IS THE FATHER OF ADAM LANZA.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
THIS IS A PICTURE OF HIM FROM

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
JUST A FEW YEARS AGO.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
HE IS NOW 20 YEARS OLD WHO

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
POLICE SAY WALKED INTO AN

INCLUDING THE PRINCIPAL, THEY'RE

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
ALL DEAD NOW, TOO.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
THE SHOOTER KILLED HIMSELF.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
THIS IS WHERE POLICE ARE TRYING

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO ANSWER THE

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
QUESTIONS WHY.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
THE LANZA HOME, NOT FAR FROM THE
SCHOOL.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
IT'S ALSO WHERE THE SUSPECTED

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
SHOOTER'S MOTHER WAS FOUND DEAD

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
AS WELL.

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
TODAY, THE FATHER AND AUNT OF

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
ONE OF THE SHOOTING VICTIMS IN

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, WENT

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
BEFORE CAMERAS TO REMEMBER A

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
CHILD THEY DESCRIBED AS

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
INCREDIBLE BUT IN REMEMBERING

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
LITTLE EMILIE PARKER, THEY SAID,

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
THEY'RE PRAYING FOR THE

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
SHOOTER'S FAMILY, TOO, BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
WANTED.

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
KYUNG LAH WAS THERE.

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
KYUNG, WHAT STUCK OUT TO YOU

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
MOST OF ALL WHEN YOU WERE

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
TALKING TO THESE PEOPLE AND YOU

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
WATCHED ALL OF THIS?

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
>> THE ABILITY OF THEM TO BE

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
ABLE TO STILL THINK OF OTHER

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
PEOPLE AND SOCIETY IN THE FACE

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
OF AN UNSPEAKABLE LOSS.

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
IF YOU'RE A PARENT, IF YOU HAVE

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
CHILDREN WHO YOU LOVE AND YOU

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
THINK ABOUT THIS HAPPENING TO

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
YOURSELF, IT'S REALLY HARD TO

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
COMPREHEND, THEN BEING ABLE TO

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
FACE NATIONAL CAMERAS, REPORTERS

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
AND MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
SOCIETY.

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS FAMILY HAS

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
DONE.

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
AND HERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
THEY SAID.

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
>> EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
TWO LITTLE SISTERS AND DELIGHTED

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
IN TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ,

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
DANCE AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS
IN LIFE.

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
EMILIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS

84
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
PLEASURE TO MEET HER WOULD AGREE

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
THAT THIS WORLD IS A BETTER

87
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
PLACE BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN IN IT.

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
>> EMILIE ALICE PARKER WAS THE

89
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
SWEETEST LITTLE GIRL I'VE EVER

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
KNOWN.

91
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
MY CHILDREN ARE GRIEVING.

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
MY SIBLINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
ARE GRIEVING AND WE'RE JUST

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
DEVASTATED THAT SOMEONE SO

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT IS NO

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
LONGER GOING TO BE IN OUR LIVES

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
AND FOR NO REASON.

98
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
>> AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
HAPPENED HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO

100
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
SO MANY PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
INTO SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US.

102
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
BUT SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
TO BE BETTER, TO BE MORE

104
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
COMPASSIONATE AND MORE HUMBLE

105
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
PEOPLE.

106
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
>> WHAT HE SAID IS THAT HE

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
SIMPLY WANTED PEOPLE TO BE ABLE

108
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
TO BECOME MORE TOLERANT, TO BE

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
MORE HUMANE.

110
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
HE IS HOPING THAT THIS IS GOING

111
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
TO BE AN EVENT WHERE PEOPLE LOOK

112
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
NOT AT THE SHOOTER, NOT AT THE

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
CRIME ITSELF BUT IN TRYING TO

114
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
BECOME BETTER PEOPLE FOR THE

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
GREATER GOOD OF SOCIETY.

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
IT'S REALLY, TRULY REMARKABLE,

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
THIS FATHER CAME HERE EIGHT

118
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
MONTHS AGO WITH HIS FAMILY TO

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000

121
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
HE'S HERE TO TRY TO HELP

122
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
CHILDREN GET BETTER AND YET HIS

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
CHILD WAS LOST DUE TO GUN

124
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
VIOLENCE.

125
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
IN THE FACE OF UNSPEAKABLE LOSS,

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000

ISSUES REALLY IS SIMPLY

130
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
STUNNING.

131
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000

HAPPENED.

135
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
KYUNG LAH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THAT.

136
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
WANT TO TALK ABOUT VICTORIA

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
SOTO, SHE ADORED HER STUDENTS

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
CALLING THEM HER KIDS.

139
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
WHEN THE SHOOTING STARTED, SHE

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
DID WHAT SHE COULD TO PROTECT

141
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
THEM.

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
TONIGHT, RESIDENTS OF STRATFORD,

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000

SHE TAUGHT FIRST GRADE AT SANDY

148
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
CNN'S JASON CARROLL JOINS ME NOW

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
HOW IS THIS COMMUNITY DEALING

155
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
UP.

156
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO SAY IT,

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
TO SEE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE,

158
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
HUNDREDS WHO CAME OUT HERE AT

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
STRATFORD HIGH SCHOOL.

160
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THIS IS WHERE VICTORIA, VICKI AS

THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW SOTO

168
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A TEACHER,

169
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
EVER SINCE SHE WAS A LITTLE

170
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
GIRL.

171
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
SHE TALKED ABOUT WANTING TO BE A

172
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
TEACHER, THAT'S WHAT HER FRIENDS

173
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
TONIGHT THEY TALKED ABOUT THE

175
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
HEROIC ACTIONS THAT SHE TOOK IN

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
HER CLASSROOM WHEN THE GUNMAN

177
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
BURST THROUGH THE DOOR, HOW SHE

178
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
RUSHED THE KIDS INTO A CLOSET TO

179
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
TRY AND SAVE THEM AND THEN OF

180
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
COURSE THE GUNMAN TOOK HER LIFE.

181
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
AS WE WERE OUT HERE TONIGHT WITH

182
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
HER SISTERS AND HER BROTHER, HER

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
COUSINS AND ALL OF HER FRIENDS,

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
AND DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO
REMEMBER HER, I SPOKE TO ONE

185
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
YOUNG WOMAN, A FRIEND OF SOTO'S

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

187
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
JUST LISTEN TO HOW SHE STRUGGLED

188
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
TO TALK ABOUT HOW SHE WILL
REMEMBER HER.

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
>> SHE WAS ALWAYS AT THE HOUSE

190
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
SMILING.

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
SHE DROVE US TO CHEERLEADING

192
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
PRACTICES A COUPLE OF TIMES.

193
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'M ALSO A TEACHER AND I CAN'T

194
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
EVEN IMAGINE GOING THROUGH WHAT

195
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
SHE WENT THROUGH.

196
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I THINK HER PUTTING HERSELF OUT

197
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
THERE -- SHE'S JUST AN ANGEL AND

198
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
SHE JUST WENT STRAIGHT INTO

199
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
HEAVEN.

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

201
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
>> DON, THE REASON WHY SOTO'S

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
FAMILY DECIDED TO HOLD THIS

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
VIGIL TONIGHT, THE REASON WHY

204
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THEY SHOWED UP AND GAVE US

205
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
PICTURES, PICTURES BY THE WAY
THAT SOTO'S MOTHER PICKED OUT

206
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
BECAUSE THEY WERE HER FAVORITE

207
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
PICTURES.

208
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THE REASON WHY THEY DID ALL THIS
IS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT

209
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
SOTO TO BE REMEMBERED AS JUST A

210
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
VICTIM.
THEY WANTED HER TO BE REMEMBERED

211
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
AS A DEDICATED TEACHER, A LOVING

212
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
DAUGHTER, A LOVING SISTER.

213
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
AT ONE POINT HER SISTER, CARLEY,

214
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
SHE STOOD UP AND SPOKE TO

215
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
EVERYONE WHO CAME OUT HERE TODAY

216
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
AND SHE SAID THE WORDS THAT SHE

217
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
HAD TWEETED EARLIER TODAY.

218
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
SHE SAID, HUG YOUR LOVED ONES,

219
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
TELL THEM HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THEM

220
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU
WILL EVER SEE THEM AGAIN.

221
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
THESE WERE THE WORDS SPOKEN BY

222
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
HER YOUNGER SISTER, 19-YEAR-OLD
CARLEY.

223
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
THIS IS HOW THEY WANT HER

224
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
REMEMBERED.
DON?

225
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
>> JASON, YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
THESE ARE NOT JUST VICTIMS.

227
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
THEY'RE EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE WHO

228
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
HAVE LED EXTRAORDINARY LIVE AND

229
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
TAKEN AWAY WAY TOO SOON.

230
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
JASON CARROLL, THANK YOU VERY

231
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
MUCH FOR THAT REPORT.

232
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
WITNESSES SAY THE FIRST SHOTS

233
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
RANG OUT YESTERDAY JUST AFTER

234
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
THE MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE

235
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
BEING READ AT SANDY HOOK

236
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

237
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
POLICE ARE TRYING TO HAMMER DOWN

238
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE

239
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
THAT MOMENT.

240
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
AND OUR TOM FOREMAN HAS A

241
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
BREAKDOWN ON WHAT INVESTIGATORS
KNOW SO FAR.

242
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
>> POLICE ARE SEARCHING OVER AN

243
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
IMMENSE CLUE FOR ANY CLUE WHY

244
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
THIS HAPPENED.

245
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
THEY'VE SEARCHED THE BROTHER'S

246
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
APARTMENT DOWN HERE IN NEW

247
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
JERSEY.

248
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
THEY BELIEVE THE GUNMAN WENT

249
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
DIRECTLY HERE AFTER HIS MOTHER'S

250
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
MURDER AND EMERGED FROM HIS CAR

251
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
IN THE PARKING LOT CARRYING

252
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
WEAPONS VERY MUCH LIKE THESE.

253
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
BUT WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

254
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
LET'S LOOK AT THE TIME LINE

255
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
BASED ON POLICE RADIO REPORTS

256
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
AND EYEWITNESSES.

257
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
9:30 IN THE MORNING, THAT'S WHEN

258
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
WE BELIEVE THAT HE EMERGED FROM

259
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
HIS CAR AND HEADED INTO THE

260
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
SCHOOL HERE.

261
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
WE DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS HIS

262
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
CAR.

263
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
BUT THEY'VE PAID A LOT OF
ATTENTION TO THIS VEHICLE OVER

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
THE PAST FEW DAYS.

265
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
HERE IS WHERE HE ENCOUNTERED HIS

266
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
FIRST BARRICADE BECAUSE THERE

267
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
WAS A SECURITY SYSTEM ON THE

268
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
DOORS THERE RECENTLY PUT IN BY

269
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
THE PRINCIPAL, WHERE HE WOULD

270
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
HAVE TO BE BUZZED IN.

271
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
POLICE LATER FOUND THAT THE

272
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
GLASS HERE HAD BEEN SHOT OUT OR

273
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
BROKEN OUT IN SOME FASHION.

274
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
THAT SEEMS TO BE HOW HE ENTERED

275
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
THE SCHOOL.

276
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?

277
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
WELL, THE FIRST CALL TO THE

278
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
POLICE THAT SAID THERE WAS A

279
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
PROBLEM CAME AT 9:36.

280
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
THE FIRST CALL SAYING THERE IS
GUNFIRE INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

281
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE IN THE SCHOOL

282
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
KNEW IT BECAUSE THEY COULD

283
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
EITHER HEAR IT DIRECTLY OR

284
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
BECAUSE THEY HEARD IT OVER THE

285
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
SCHOOL'S P.A. SYSTEM, THERE WERE

286
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
ANNOUNCEMENTS BEING MADE AT THE

287
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
TIME.

288
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
ALL THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE IN A

289
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
A VERY SMALL AREA UP IN THIS

290
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
PART OF THE SCHOOL.

291
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY

292
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
ELSE HAVE SOME IDEA THAT THIS

293
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
WAS GOING ON SO THEY COULD TRY

294
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
TO BE SAFE IN THESE

295
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
CIRCUMSTANCES.
BEYOND THAT, WHAT HAPPENED?

296
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
AT 9:38, POLICE WERE SAYING

297
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
ALREADY THEY WERE HEARING

298
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
REPORTS THAT THE SHOOTING WAS

299
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
OVER.

300
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
AN INCREDIBLY SHORT PERIOD OF
TIME.

301
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
2, 2 1/2 MINUTES, MAYBE, WHERE

302
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
THE BULK, IF NOT ALL OF THE

303
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
SHOOTING TOOK PLACE.

304
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
WHAT WAS THE NEXT PHASE OF ALL

305
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
OF THIS?
THE NEXT PHASE CAME WHEN AT

306
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
ABOUT 9:40, POLICE AT THE SCHOOL

307
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
SAID, WE NEED SOME EMERGENCY

308
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
MEDICAL SERVICES HERE.

309
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
THAT WAS THE FIRST CALL FOR

310
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
AMBULANCES.

311
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
IT WAS FOR TWO AMBULANCES TO

312
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
BEGIN WITH AND THEN AS THEY

313
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
REALIZED THEY HAD MANY MORE

314
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
VICTIMS IN A MATTER OF MINUTES,

315
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
THERE WAS A CALL FOR MANY, MANY
MORE EMERGENCY MEDICAL

316
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
TECHNICIANS AND AMBULANCES TO

317
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
COME TO THE SCHOOL.

318
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
AND THEN SURPRISINGLY, BY 9:50

319
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
IN THE MORNING, POLICE WERE

320
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT THEY HAD

321
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
A SUSPECT WHO WAS DOWN, MEANING

322
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
THEY HAD HAD ONE SUSPECT WHO IS

323
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
DEAD, THEY HAD SECURED THE

324
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
BUILDING TO SOME DEGREE.

325
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
THEY'D CLEARED THE BUILDING IS

326
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THE LANGUAGE THEY USED.

327
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
AND A LOT OF THE KIDS WERE BEING

328
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
LED AWAY.

329
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
THIS IS A PICTURE FROM "THE

330
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
NEWTOWN BEE" OF THE KIDS BEING

331
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
LED AWAY.

332
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
THIS IS A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF

333
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
TIME, FROM 17 TO 20 MINUTES THAT

334
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
THIS WENT FROM NOTHING HAPPENING

335
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
TO ALL OF THESE EVENTS HAPPENING
THAT HAVE CHANGED THE LIVES OF

336
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
SO MANY PEOPLE.

337
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
AND POLICE WILL CONTINUE GOING

338
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE

339
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
DETAILS OF THE MOVEMENT OF THIS

340
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
SHOOTER AND HIS VICTIMS TO TRY

341
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF

342
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
PRECISELY HOW IT ALL HAPPENED.

343
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
>> TOM, THANKS.

344
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT BUILDING
AFFECTED EVERYONE.

345
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
THE TRAGEDY IS TOUGH FOR THE

346
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
ENTIRE COMMUNITY HERE.

347
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
AND THOSE NOT DIRECTLY AFFECTED

348
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
STILL WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

349
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
EARLIER, I SPOKE WITH TWO WOMEN

350
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
TRYING TO DO JUST THAT.

351
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
WHEN YOU CAME UP TO TALK TO ME,

352
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
YOU LADIES COULD BARELY GET THE

353
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
WORDS OUT.

354
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
>> THIS IS -- THERE ARE NO

355
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
WORDS.

356
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
THERE ARE NO WORDS.

357
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
AND EVEN RIGHT NOW, WE KNOW THAT

358
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
FAMILIES ARE CRYING TOGETHER,

359
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
TRYING TO GET THROUGH DAY TO

360
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
DAY.

361
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
AND WE FEEL THAT SINCE WE

362
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
WEREN'T DIRECTLY IMPACTED, WE

363
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
FEEL LIKE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

364
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
USE OUR VOICES TO SAY THINGS

365
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
THAT WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE

366
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
GOING TO BE SAYING FOR A LONG

367
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
TIME AFTER THE CAMERAS ARE GONE.

368
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
AND SOMETIMES IT'S AFTER THE

369
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
CAMERAS ARE GONE THAT THINGS

370
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
STOP WORKING.

371
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
AND MOTION STOPS.

372
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
>> FOR YOU, YOU'VE BEEN CRYING

373
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
THE ENTIRE TIME YOU'RE STANDING

374
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
HERE.

375
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
>> THERE ARE NO WORDS.

376
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
THERE ARE NO ADEQUATE WORDS TO

377
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
DESCRIBE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE

378
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
AND HOW CHILDREN AND PARENTS AND

379
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
GRANDPARENTS AND UNCLES AND

380
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
AUNTS AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE FAR

381
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
AWAY WHO JUST KNOW THAT WE ARE

382
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
HERE, THERE ARE NO WORDS.

383
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
AND THIS CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE

384
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
ANYWHERE.

385
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
WE NEED TO MAKE OUR CHILDREN

386
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
FEEL SAFE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

387
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW WE CAN DO

388
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
THAT.

389
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I WANT SOMEONE TO GIVE US AN

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000

>> BY YOU ASKING, SOME OF THOSE

392
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
QUESTIONS MAY BE ANSWERED.

393
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
AND YOU ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE.

394
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
YOU ARE HELPING.

401
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
>> ARE YOU GOING TO SEND THEM TO
SCHOOL?

402
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
>> I'M GOING TO SEND THEM TO

403
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
SCHOOL AS LONG AS I CAN TELL

404
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
THEM THAT SOMEBODY IS DOING

405
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO MAKE THEM

406
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
FEEL SAFE.

407
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
>> HOW OLD ARE YOUR KIDS?

408
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
>> MY DAUGHTER IS 11 AND MY SON

409
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
IS 8.

410
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
>> ARE YOU GOING TO SEND THEM TO

411
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
SCHOOL?

412
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
>> IF I FEEL THAT THEY'RE SAFE,

413
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
IF I FEEL THAT THEY'RE SAFE.

414
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
>> THANK YOU.

415
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
>> IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE.

416
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
>> THANK YOU.

417
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'M SO SORRY.

THANK YOU.

YOU.

421
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
>> CAN I HAVE THIS NOTE FOR

422
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
EVERY PARENT?
>> YEAH.

423
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE KIND

424
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
OF COVERAGE THAT YOU'RE --

425
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
YOU'VE BEEN VERY SENSITIVE.

426
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
>> THOSE WOMEN DIDN'T WANT THEIR

427
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
FACES ON CAMERA.

428
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
THEY SAID WE COULD SHOOT THEM

429
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
FROM THE SIDE BECAUSE THEY HAD

430
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
BEEN CRYING ALL DAY.

431
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
THE REASON THEY CAME HERE, THEY

432
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
SAID THEY WERE WATCHING THE

433
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
BROADCAST EARLIER AND I ASKED,

434
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN TO YOUR

435
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
CHILDREN, WHAT DO YOU DO NEXT?

436
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
AND THIS IS THE NOTE THAT THEY

437
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
WROTE TO ME BEFORE THEY WALKED

438
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
AWAY.

439
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I SAID, PLEASE LET ME PUT IT ON
CAMERA.

440
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
THEY SAID, EARLIER YOU ASKED

441
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
SOMEONE BEING INTERVIEWED WHAT

442
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
WE WOULD WANT OUR COUNTRY TO DO

443
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

444
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD LIKE.

445
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
RIGHT AWAY, WE NEED SPECIFIC

446
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
PLANS AND ACTIONS TO IMPROVE

447
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
SAFETY FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR

448
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
SCHOOLS BEFORE THEY'RE EXPECTED

449
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
TO RETURN TO SCHOOL.

450
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
WE FEEL WE COULD BETTER ENSURE

451
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
OUR CHILDREN'S SAFE BY PLACING A

452
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
PERMANENT OFFICER IN EACH OF OUR

453
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
SCHOOLS IN NEWTOWN SO THEY WILL

454
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
KNOW THAT SOMEONE IS THERE FOR

455
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING THEIR

456
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
SCHOOL AND THEN THEY WENT ON

457
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
SAYING WHAT ELSE THEY WOULD

458
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
LIKE.
BASICALLY THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE

459
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
THAT THEIR KIDS ARE SAFE WHEN

460
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
THEY GO TO SCHOOL.

461
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
THEY SAID THEIR KIDS ARE ASKING

462
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
THEM QUESTIONS THAT THEY CAN'T

463
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
ANSWER AND THEY'RE AFRAID TO GO

464
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
BACK TO SCHOOL IN THE COMING

465
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
WEEKS.

466
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
A LOT OF PARENTS REALLY ARE

467
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS RIGHT

468
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
NOW.

469
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO

470
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
GET THEM ON, PUT THEM ON CAMERA

471
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
AND LET THEIR VOICES BE HEARD.

472
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
TONIGHT, A LOT OF PARENTS

473
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
WATCHING THESE EVENTS AT HOME,

474
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
WHILE THEIR HEARTS ACHE FOR

475
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
THEIR FAMILIES, THEY HAVE TO BE

476
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
WORRIED, THEY HAVE TO BE
WORRIED.

477
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
COULD IT HAPPEN HERE?

478
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT SCHOOL

479
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
SAFETY IN A MOMENT.

480
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
ALSO A YOUNG MAN WHO RAN TO THE

481
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
SCHOOL WHEN HE HEARD THE SHOTS.

482
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
HIS STORY IS NEXT.

483
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
THIS IS AMYS
TO INVEST IN THE MARKET.

484
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
SHE ALSO LIKES TO RIDE
HER BIKE.

485
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
SHE KNOWS THE POTENTIAL
FOR MAKING OR LOSING MONEY

486
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
CAN POP UP ANYTIME.

487
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
THAT'S WHY SHE TRADES WITH
THE LEADER IN MOBILE TRADING.

488
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
SO SHE'S ALWAYS READY
TO TAKE ACTION,

489
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
NO MATTER HOW WILY...

490
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
OR WEIRD...

491
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
OR WONDERFULLY
THE MARKET'S BEHAVING...

492
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
WHICH ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

493
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.

494
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
FROM TD AMERITRADE.

495
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000

496
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000

CONNECTICUT.

499
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
TOMORROW WILL NO DOUBT BE

500
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
ANOTHER EMOTIONAL DAY HERE.

501
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
THE PRESIDENT IS COMING TO MEET

502
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
WITH THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES.

503
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
HE'S ALSO GOING TO BE ATTEND AN

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
INTERFAITH VIGIL SCHEDULED FOR

505
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
TOMORROW EVENING.

506
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
THE SHOOTER'S FATHER RELEASED A

507
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
STATEMENT TONIGHT.

508
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
THE FATHER'S NAME IS PETER

509
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
LANZA.

510
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
HE SAYS, WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS

511
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
HIS FAMILY'S HEARTBREAK.

512
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
HE SAYS THE FAMILY IS IN WHAT HE

513
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
CALLS A STATE OF DISBELIEF.

514
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
SIX WOMEN, 20 CHILDREN DIED AT

515
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

516
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
THAT NUMBER INCLUDES 12 GIRLS

517
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
AND EIGHT BOYS.

518
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
16 OF THE KIDS WERE ONLY 6 YEARS

519
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
OLD.

520
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
THE OTHERS HAD TURNED 7 IN JUST

521
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
THE LAST FEW MONTHS.

522
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I WANT TO BRING IN NOW A STUDENT

523
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
AT NEWTOWN HIGH SCHOOL.

524
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
YOU ACTUALLY RAN INTO THE SCHOOL

525
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
WHEN YOU HEARD THE SHOTS.

526
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
YOU STAYED HOME FROM SCHOOL THAT

527
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
DAY BY HAPPENSTANCE.

528
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
YOU RAN INTO THE SCHOOL.

529
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
WHAT HAPPENED?

530
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
>> I DID NOT ACTUALLY RUN INTO

531
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
THE SCHOOL BUT I WAS VERY CLOSE

532
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
TO THE PERIMETER OF THE SCHOOL

533
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
AND THAT'S WHERE -- AS SOON AS I

534
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
ENTERED THE DRIVEWAY OF THE

535
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
SCHOOL, WE SAW A LOT OF POLICE

536
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
CARS THERE.

537
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
>> YOU WERE AT HOME.

538
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
DID YOU HEAR SHOTS?

539
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
WHAT DID YOU --

540
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
>> WELL, MY NEIGHBOR CALLED US

541
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
CLAIMING SHE HEARD SHOTS.

542
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
AND THAT'S WHEN WE HEARD A LOT

543
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
OF SIRENS GOING OFF.

544
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
AND THAT'S WHEN WE GOT VERY

545
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
CONCERNED BECAUSE THE SCHOOL DID

546
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
NOT PICK UP THE PHONE.

547
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
WE CALLED THE SCHOOL.

548
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
THEY DID NOT PICK UP THE PHONE.

549
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
THAT WAS WHEN WE REALLY BECAME

550
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
CONCERNED.

551
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
>> ONCE YOU GOT THERE, YOU SAID

552
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
YOU GOT TO THE PERIMETER OF THE
SCHOOL.

553
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
>> RIGHT.

554
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
>> ONCE YOU GOT THERE, THEN

555
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
WHAT?

556
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
>> THEN IT WAS JUST HORRIFYING.

557
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
WITHIN A MATTER OF THREE

558
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
MINUTES, WE SAW TWO STUDENTS

559
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
BEING CARRIED OUT BY STATE
TROOPERS.

560
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
THEY WERE NOT MOVING.

561
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
THEY WERE VERY PALE AND IT WAS

562
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
JUST A VERY HORRIFYING SCENE.

563
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
AND THEN A THIRD FEMALE CAME

564
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
OUT.

565
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
SHE HAD A LOT OF BLOOD OVER HER

566
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
FACE.

567
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
IT WAS JUST HORRIBLE.

568
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
IT WAS BLOOD SPLATTER FROM OTHER

569
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
STUDENTS WAS MY GUESS BECAUSE

570
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
SHE WAS WALKING FINE.

571
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
>> THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT

572
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, 5, 6, 7
YEARS OLD.

573
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
>> YEAH, NO MORE THAN THAT.

574
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

575
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
>> DID YOU FEEL HELPLESS IN NOT

576
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING?

577
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S THE

578
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
BEST WORD TO DESCRIBE IT.
HELPLESS.

579
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I WAS WAITING FOR MY SISTER.

580
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
IT WAS 20 MINUTES BETWEEN THE

581
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
TIME I SAW THOSE OTHER

582
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
FEMALES --
>> YOUR SISTER GOES TO THE

583
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
SCHOOL?
>> YES, SHE DOES.

584
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
>> YOU DIDN'T KNOW --

585
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
>> I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS

586
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
HAPPENING TO HER.

587
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
>> YOUR SISTER IS 7?

588
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
>> SHE'S 9.
>> SHE'S 9?

589
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
>> CORRECT.

590
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
>> NOT KNOWING IN THOSE

591
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
MOMENTS --

592
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
>> IT WAS HORRIBLE.

593
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
THOUGHTS WERE RUNNING THROUGH MY

594
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
HEAD, ALL MY MEMORIES WITH HER

595
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
WERE RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD

596
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
DURING THOSE 20 MINUTES.

597
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
IT SEEMED LIKE DAYS.

598
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
BUT IT WAS HORRIFYING.

599
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
>> WHEN DID SHE COME OUT?

600
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
>> SHE CAME OUT ABOUT 20 MINUTES

601
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
AFTER THE -- I SAW THE OTHER

602
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
STUDENTS -- THE TWO OTHER

603
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
STUDENTS THAT UNFORTUNATELY WERE

604
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
PRONOUNCED DEAD LATER ON.

605
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
AND THE STUDENTS -- ALL THE

606
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
STUDENTS WERE CRYING AND

607
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
SOBBING.

608
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
AND THEY WERE JUST -- THEY WERE

609
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
TRAUMATIZED.

610
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
>> HOW'S YOUR SISTER DOING?

611
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
>> SHE'S DOING WELL.

612
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
AGAIN, SHE'S VERY TRAUMATIZED

613
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
NATURALLY.

614
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
BUT I CREDIT THE TEACHERS FOR

615
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
KEEPING THEM CALM.

616
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
THEY'RE VERY HEROIC TEACHERS

617
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
THAT DAY.

618
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
THE PRINCIPAL, THERE WERE

619
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
MULTIPLE TEACHERS THAT DID A

620
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
FANTASTIC JOB KEEPING THE
CHILDREN CALM.

621
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
>> WHAT DID YOUR SISTER SAY?
DID SHE HEAR ANYTHING --

622
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
>> YEAH.

623
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
THE FIRST THING SHE TOLD ME WAS

624
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
THAT SHE HAD HEARD THE INTERCOM

625
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
SYSTEM COME ON AND THROUGH THE

626
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
INTERCOM, SHE HEARD SCREAMS AND

627
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
BULLETS -- SHE HEARD THE

628
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
GUNSHOTS AND THE SCREAMS

629
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
OCCURRING IN THE MAIN OFFICE OF

630
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
THE BUILDING.

631
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHEN THE
SCHOOL WENT INTO LOCKDOWN.

632
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
>> A 9-YEAR-OLD.

633
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
CAN YOU IMAGINE A 9-YEAR-OLD

634
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
HAVING TO DEAL WITH THAT?

635
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I JUST CAN'T.

636
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
>> IT'S TRAUMATIC.

637
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
>> TELL US -- TALK TO OUR

638
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
VIEWERS AND EVERYONE WHO'S

639
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
WATCHING HERE ABOUT HOW YOU GUYS

640
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
ARE DOING, YOUR SISTER, YOUR

641
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
FAMILY, THE COMMUNITY?

642
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
>> FIRST OFF, I'D REALLY LIKE TO

643
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
GIVE MY CONDOLENCES TO EVERYONE

644
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
WHO'S SUFFERING FROM THIS,

645
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS, IT'S AN

646
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY.

647
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
BUT I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE
IN NEWTOWN.

648
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
CULTURALLY WE'RE A VERY, VERY

649
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
STRONG TOWN.

650
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
AND WE STICK TOGETHER.

651
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
WE'RE A TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY.

652
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO WORK

653
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
THROUGH THIS.

654
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
EVERYONE CARES ABOUT EVERYONE.

655
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
AND THAT'S JUST WHO WE ARE.

656
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
THAT'S OUR CULTURE.

657
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
>> YOU'RE 17?

658
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
>> YES.

659
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
>> THE SHOOTER IS 20.
DID YOU KNOW HIM?

660
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
>> NO.

661
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
BUT UPON HEARING HE WAS 20, I

662
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
WAS SHOCKED.

663
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I WAS LOST FOR WORDS.

664
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
HOW COULD SOMEONE SO YOUNG

665
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
COMMIT SUCH A HEINOUS ACT.

666
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
>> YOU DON'T KNOW HIS FAMILY?

667
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
>> I DO NOT.
I DO NOT.

668
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
>> THANK YOU.

669
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
>> THANK YOU.

670
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I APPRECIATE IT.

671
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
>> WE'RE GLAD YOUR SISTER IS

672
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
OKAY.

673
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
AGAIN, OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS

674
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
ARE WITH EVERYONE HERE.

675
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
>> THANK YOU.

676
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
>> APPRECIATE IT.

677
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
IT'S GOING TO BE AMAZING JUST TO

678
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
WATCH THIS COMMUNITY IN THE

679
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
COMING DAYS TRY TO DEAL WITH

680
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
THIS, TO SEE HOW THEY'RE GOING

681
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
TO COPE, HOW THE WORLD IS GOING

682
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
TO TRY TO HELP THEM GET THROUGH

683
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
IT, WHAT WORDS OF COMFORT THE

684
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
PRESIDENT WILL OFFER THEM AS

685
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
WELL.

686
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
WE'LL BE HERE TO COVER IT FOR

687
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
YOU HERE ON CNN.

688
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
A LITTLE WHILE AGO, I TOOK A

689
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
WALK THROUGH THIS TOWN, THIS

690
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
TOWN OF JUST 27,000 PEOPLE, ALL

691
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
OF THEM STILL TRYING TO PROCESS

692
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
THE HORROR OF WHAT HAPPENED JUST

693
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
DOWN THE ROAD.

694
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
RIGHT BEHIND ME, THAT'S THE ROAD

695
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
THAT LEADS UP TO THE SCHOOL

696
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
WHERE THIS HAPPENED.

697
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
IT HAS BEEN BLOCKED OFF.

698
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
YOU CAN SEE THE SIGN HERE RIGHT

699
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
ACROSS THE STREET ON THAT PORCH,

700
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
IT SAYS, GOD BLESS SANDY HOOK.

701
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
AND RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF

702
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
THE SQUARE, 26 CANDLES FOR ALL

703
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS TRAGEDY

704
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
RIGHT HERE AT THE TIME SQUARE.

705
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
AND UP THE STREET, A CHURCH

706
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
WHERE THE VICTIMS ARE BEING

707
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
MEMORIALIZED.

708
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
THIS IS ONE OF THE INTIMATE

709
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
LITTLE SQUARES HERE IN SANDY

710
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
HOOK.

711
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
YOU CAN SEE THE LITTLE QUAINT

712
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
STORES, BEAUTIFUL LITTLE STORES.

713
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
AND THEN COME THIS WAY, YOU CAN

714
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
SEE JUST THE MEDIA.

715
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
AND PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THIS
SQUARE OVER.

716
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE HERE, THEY

717
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
SAY, THERE'S NEVER THIS MANY

718
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
PEOPLE.

719
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
THERE ARE NEVER THIS MANY PEOPLE

720
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
WHO COME TO THIS TOWN ON A

721
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
SATURDAY OR SUNDAY.

722
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
TO SEE HOW INTIMATE AND

723
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
BEAUTIFUL THIS TOWN IS, LOOK, A

724
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
CREEK THAT RUNS RIGHT THROUGH

725
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
IT.

726
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
THE PEOPLE OF THIS SMALL TOWN

727
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
PROBABLY NEVER DREAMED THAT

728
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
THEIR TOWN WOULD BE THE FOCUS OF
SUCH PAIN AND ANGUISH AND

729
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
SORROW.
THIS IS THE NEWTOWN UNITED

730
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
METHODIST CHURCH AND WHERE A LOT

731
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
OF THE MEDIA ARE CAMPED OUT.

732
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
THERE'S THE CHURCH BEHIND ME.

733
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
IT'S BEEN OPENED NOW FOR 24

734
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
HOURS.

735
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
IT'S GOING TO BE OPEN MORE 24

736
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
HOURS FOR AS LONG AS THEY NEED

737
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
IT HERE.

738
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THAT

739
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
CHURCH DIED AND ANYONE WHO WANTS

740
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
TO COME BY AND PAY THEIR

741
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
RESPECTS TO THE PEOPLE WHO DIED,

742
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
ANYONE WHO NEEDS HELP FROM THIS

743
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
CHURCH, THEY CAN COME HERE AND
GET IT.

744
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
AFTER THIS SHOOTING INSIDE SANDY

745
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, THE

746
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
SAFETY ISSUE WILL NOW BE FRONT

747
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
AND CENTER AT SCHOOLS ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.

748
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
DO CLASSROOMS NEED TO BE CHANGED

749
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
INTO PANIC ROOMS OR AS I'VE BEEN

750
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
SAYING EARLIER, CAN WE MAKE

751
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
CLASSROOMS INTO MINI PRISONS?

752
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT WE MAY HAVE

753
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
TO MAKE OUR SCHOOLS IN ORDER TO

754
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
BE SAFE.

755
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I WANT TO BRING IN LOU PALUMBO.

756
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
SOME SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE

757
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
ROAMING OFFICERS, METAL

758
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
DETECTORS, OFFICERS ROAMING THE

759
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
HALLWAYS.

760
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE OUR

761
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
SCHOOLS SAFER?

762
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
DO WE NEED ALL OF THESE MEASURES

763
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
IN PLACE?

764
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
>> WELL, APPARENTLY BASED ON

765
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
THIS INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE UP

766
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
HERE YESTERDAY, I GUESS YOU

767
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
COULD SUPPORT THAT ARGUMENT.

768
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
IT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE TO THINK
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

769
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
CREATE ENVIRONMENTS FOR OUR

770
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
CHILDREN TO LEARN IN THAT ARE A

771
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
BIT MORE SECURE.

772
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
AND I DON'T THINK MY

773
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ANYTHING

774
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
THAT ARE EXTREME.

775
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I MENTIONED TO YOU EARLIER, DON,

776
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
ONE THING I WOULD DO IS LOCK

777
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
THESE CLASSROOM DOORS.

778
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I WOULD CHANGE THE DOORS AND

779
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
FORTIFY THE LOCKS AND UPGRADE

780
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
THEM.

781
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
THE SAME ON ENTERING THE

782
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
BUILDING.

783
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
THERE'S A CONDITION WHAT WE CALL
A MANTRAP.

784
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
THAT'S WHEN YOU ENTER FROM AN

785
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
OUTER DOOR INTO A TYPE OF FOYER

786
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
AREA WHERE THERE'S ANOTHER DOOR

787
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
AND THAT DOOR IS SECURED UNTIL

788
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH WHO YOU

789
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
ARE.

790
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS

791
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
BIGGER ISSUES THAT ARE NOT JUST

792
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
IMPACTING OUR EDUCATIONAL

793
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
INSTITUTIONS BUT OUR ENTIRE

794
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
COUNTRY.

795
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
IT HAS TO DO WITH YOUR SAFETY,

796
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
OUR PEACE OF MIND.

797
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT A

798
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
CHANCE TO HEAR THE TWO MOTHER
THAT IS CAME UP AND WROTE ME THE

799
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
LETTER ABOUT WHAT THEY SAY TO

800
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
THEIR KIDS.

801
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
THEY SAY, OUR KIDS ARE ASKING

802
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
ALL THOSE QUESTIONS.

803
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS.

804
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
THEY'RE ASKING US ABOUT GOING

805
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
BACK TO SCHOOL ON MONDAY.

806
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
HOW DO YOU REASSURE PARENTS AND

807
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
EVEN STUDENTS THAT THEY'RE SAFE

808
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
AT SCHOOL?

809
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
CAN YOU REASSURE THEM?

810
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
CAN YOU BE SURE OF THAT?

811
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
>> APPARENTLY YOU CANNOT.

812
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
WHAT I WOULD DO IN THE
TRANSITIONAL PERIOD IN

813
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
PARTICULAR FOR THESE CHILDREN UP

814
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
HERE, I WOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF

815
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
UNIFORM LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE

816
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
TO EASE THEM THROUGH A

817
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
TRANSITION OF COMFORT AGAIN TO

818
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
WHERE THEY CAN START TO RELAX

819
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
AND FEEL A BIT MORE SECURE AND A

820
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
BIT MORE SAFE.

821
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I DON'T THINK THE GRAVITY OF

822
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
THIS SITUATION FOR ALL OF US HAS

823
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
SET IN YET, NOT IN THIS

824
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
COMMUNITY AND NOT IN THIS

825
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
NATION.

826
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALLY HAVE

827
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
THOUGHT THIS THROUGH WHAT THE

828
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
ANGUISH WAS FOR THESE BABIES IN

829
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
THAT CLASSROOM.

830
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
IT'S A LITTLE DISTURBING TO EVEN
SPEAK ABOUT IT.

831
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
>> THAT THIS HAPPENS -- I SAID

832
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
AMAZING EARLIER, AND THE

833
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
PERPLEXING SENSE OF THAT WORD

834
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
THAT EVERY TIME WE HEAR ABOUT

835
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
THIS, WE SAY, YOU KNOW, THE

836
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
COMMUNITY'S RESILIENT.

837
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
THEY'LL GET THROUGH IT.

838
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING TO SAY

839
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
THAT.

840
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
>> WITHOUT QUESTION.

841
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
AND WE SHOULDN'T BE BURYING

842
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
CHILDREN AT THIS AGE.

843
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
IT'S SYMPTOMATIC OF A MUCH

844
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
LARGER PROBLEM IN OUR COUNTRY.

845
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
>> I WENT ON THE AIR I THINK IT

846
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
WAS ABOUT 11:40 ON FRIDAY AND I

847
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
WAS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT SAFETY

848
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
AND SECURITY.

849
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
AND I SAID, LOU, YOU SEND YOUR

850
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
KIDS OFF TO SCHOOL AND THIS IS

851
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
THE WORST PHONE CALL THAT YOU

852
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
CAN GET.

853
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
THEN WE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS

854
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
JUST SOME ANGRY PARENT OR

855
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
SOMEONE WHO HAD JUST COME IN AND

856
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
THAT WAS THE ONLY PERSON
INVOLVED.

857
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
AND THEN AN HOUR LATER, WE FIND

858
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
OUT IT'S 20 CHILDREN INVOLVED IN

859
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
THIS SHOOTING.

860
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
WE HAVE TO STOP THIS.

861
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT MENTAL HEALTH

862
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
ISSUES AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

863
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
GUN LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY.

864
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
>> WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS

865
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
INTERPRETATION WE HAVE OF THE

866
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
CONSTITUTION.

867
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
AND I WOULD SAY INTERJECT SOME

868
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
LEVEL OF COMMON SENSE, DECENCY

869
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
AND SENSIBILITY.

870
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
NO ONE'S OPPOSED TO IS SECOND

871
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
AMENDMENT.

872
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'M CERTAINLY NOT.

873
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE.

874
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
>> I THINK WHEN PEOPLE SEE US DO

875
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
THIS -- THEY SAY, NO ONE'S

876
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
TRYING TO DO THAT.

877
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE TRYING

878
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
TO MAKE AN ISSUE OF.

879
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
LET'S REALLY TALK ABOUT THIS,

880
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
LOU.

881
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
WE DON'T COVER MULTIPLE

882
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
STABBINGS WHERE 20 PEOPLE -- 26

883
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
PEOPLE DIE IN A SCHOOL.

884
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
WE DON'T COVER WHERE MOLOTOV

885
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
COCKTAIL GOES OFF IN THE SCHOOL

886
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE.

887
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
IT'S USUALLY FROM SOMEONE WITH

888
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
SOME TYPE OF ASSAULT WEAPON AND

889
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
SOMEONE WHO HAS A SICK MIND WHO

890
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
GOES IN AND DOES THESE SORTS OF

891
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
THINGS.

892
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
>> THE REAL UNFORTUNATE PART IS

893
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
COUPLED WITH A SICK MIND OR

894
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
DERANGEMENT OR DELUSION, WE HAVE

895
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
A VEHICLE OF DELIVERY OF THEIR

896
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
MESSAGE.

897
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
THAT'S WHERE THE FIREARM COMES

898
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
IN.

899
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
WHAT WE SPOKE TO EARLIER IS

900
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
KNOWING A BIT MORE ABOUT THE

901
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
PEOPLE WE'RE PUTTING THESE

902
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
FIREARMS IN THE HANDS OF.

903
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
TALKING ABOUT JUST SCREENING

904
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
PEOPLE PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

905
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
THIS IS NOT AN ANOMALY.

906
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
THIS IS BECOMING A PATTERN.

907
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
ALTHOUGH THEY WOULD LIKE TO

908
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
STATISTICALLY ADDRESS THIS BY

909
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
SAYING THE NUMBER OF TIMES OR

910
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
THE PERCENTAGE OF THESE

911
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
INCIDENTS IN DIRECT PROPORTION

912
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
TO OUR POPULATION ARE .5%.

913
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
THAT'S A GREAT STATISTIC UNLESS

914
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
IT'S YOUR CHILD.

915
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
BUT THERE ARE WAYS WE CAN DO

916
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
THIS.

917
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS

918
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
TAKE THE POLITICAL ASPECT OF

919
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
THIS THING OUT AND SIT DOWN THE

920
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

921
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
CHANGE THE WAY WE'RE ADDRESSING

922
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
THIS.

923
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
THIS IS A DISGUSTING PROBLEM

924
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH --

925
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
>> AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

926
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
HAVE TO DEAL WITH.
THANK YOU.

927
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
>> WITHOUT QUESTION.

928
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
>> AND AS YOU SAY, TAKE THE
POLITICS OUT OF IT.

929
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
IT'S A COMMONSENSE ISSUE, NOT A

930
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
LEFT/RIGHT ISSUE.

931
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

932
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
MOST OF US CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE

933
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
HOW THIS CAN HAPPEN.

934
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
BUT SOME PEOPLE CAN BECAUSE THEY

935
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT BEFORE.

936
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
CNN'S JOSH LEVS TELLS US HOW

937
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
VICTIMS OF THE 1999 COLUMBINE

938
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
SHOOTING ARE REACTING TO THIS

939
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
HORROR.

940
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
>> MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER

941
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
THE WORLD ARE MOURNING FOR THE

942
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED IN

943
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
CONNECTICUT.

944
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN GROUP OF

945
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, A VERY

946
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
SMALL GROUP, FORTUNATELY, THAT

947
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
CAN ASSOCIATE IN A WAY THAT MOST

948
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
OF US CANNOT IMAGINE.

949
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT

950
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
IT'S LIKE TO BE AT SCHOOL WHEN A

951
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
TYPICAL DAY TURNS INTO CARNAGE.

952
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
SOME OF THEM ARE SURVIVORS OF

953
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
THE COLUMBINE MASSACRE 14 YEARS

954
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
AGO, SOME OF WHOM ARE NOW

955
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
PARENTS THEMSELVES.

956
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I SPOKE WITH ONE WHO'S NOW A

957
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
MOM, CASEY JOHNSON.

958
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
>> YOU LOSE THE SENSE THAT

959
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
THINGS COULD NEVER HAPPEN TO

960
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
YOU.

961
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
SO MANY PARENTS WOULD SAY, THIS

962
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AT MY CHILD'S

963
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
SCHOOL.

964
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
FOR ME AS A PARENT OF A CHILD, I

965
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
BELIEVE THIS COULD EASILY HAPPEN

966
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
AT MY CHILD'S SCHOOL BECAUSE

967
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
THAT'S BECAUSE IT HAS HAPPENED

968
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
TO ME BEFORE.

969
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I WOULD HOPE THAT THE PEOPLE

970
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
INVOLVED WILL WALK BESIDE THESE

971
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES FOR

972
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
THE YEARS TO COME.

973
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
THEY HAVE YEARS AND YEARS OF

974
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
HEALING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

975
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
FACING.

976
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN COME

977
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
BESIDE THEM AND ENCOURAGE THEM

978
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
AND FOCUS POSITIVELY ON THE

979
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
LIVES OF THE ONES THAT WERE

980
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
LOST.

981
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
>> I WANT YOU TO MEAT SHAWN

982
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
GRAVES.

983
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
SHAWN WAS SHOT SIX TIMES AT

984
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
COLUMBINE.

985
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
HE ENDED UP SPENDING MORE THAN A

986
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
YEAR IN A WHEELCHAIR.

987
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
TO THIS DAY, HE HAS SOME PAIN

988
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
BECAUSE OF IT.
I SPOKE WITH HIM ABOUT HOW THE

989
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
NEWS FROM CONNECTICUT IS
AFFECTING HIM.

990
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
>> I LIVE WITH PAIN PHYSICALLY

991
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
ON A DAILY BASIS BECAUSE OF THE

992
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
INJURIES THAT I SUSTAINED.

993
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
BUT LOOKING BACK THEN, I TRY NOT

994
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

995
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
BUT WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS

996
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
HAPPENS, THAT'S THE FIRST THING

997
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
YOU DO.

998
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
YOU BEGIN TO RELIVE IT.

999
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
AND TURNING IT ON TO THE --

1000
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
PUTTING ON THE NEWS AND JUST

1001
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
WATCHING THE COVERAGE LIVE FROM

1002
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
THIS POINT OF VIEW VERSUS WHERE

1003
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I WAS THEN, IT WILL TAKE YOU

1004
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
THROUGH AN EMOTIONAL TOLL,

1005
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
THAT'S FOR SURE.
>> AND A LOT OF THE SURVIVORS OF

1006
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
COLUMBINE WERE ACTUALLY REACHING

1007
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
OUT TO FAMILIES IN CONNECTICUT,

1008
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
SOME OF THEM HAVE FORMED A GROUP

1009
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
NOW THAT REACH OUT TO FAMILIES

1010
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
AFTER MASS SHOOTINGS AND THEY

1011
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
ARE JUST AMONG THE MANY AROUND

1012
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000

1013
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THE WAKE OF THIS TRAGEDY.

1014
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
WE INVITE YOU TO SHARE YOUR

1015
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000

1017
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
>> JOSH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1018
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
LET'S NOT FORGET THE FIRST

1019
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
VICTIM OF THIS TRAGEDY HERE IN

1020
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
NEWTOWN, THE MOTHER OF THE

1021
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
SHOOTER.

1022
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
NEXT, MORE ABOUT HER AND THE

1023
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
WEAPONS THAT ENDED UP IN THE

1024
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
HANDS OF HER TROUBLED SON.

1025
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
...so as you can see, GEICO's
customer satisfaction is at 97%.

1026
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Mmmm tasty.

1027
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And cut! Very good.

1028
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

1029
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

1030
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

1031
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's not real.

1032
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

1033
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

1034
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

1035
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

1036
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000

ONLY APPLY TO THOSE MAKING $1

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WANTS

1110
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
LEARNING MORE EACH DAY THAT MAY
EXPLAIN WHAT LED 20-YEAR-OLD

ADAM LANZA TO LAUNCH A VICIOUS

1112
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
ATTACK ON YOUNG CHILDREN AND

1113
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
ADULTS AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1114
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
>> OUR INVESTIGATORS AT THE

1115
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
CRIME SCENE, THE SCHOOL AND

1116
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
SECONDARILY AT IF SECONDARY

1117
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
CRIME SCENE THAT WE DISCUSSED

1118
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
WHERE THE FEMALE WAS LOCATED

1119
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
DECEASED, DID PRODUCE SOME VERY

1120
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
GOOD EVIDENCE IN THIS

1121
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
INVESTIGATION THAT OUR

1122
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
INVESTIGATORS WILL BE ABLE TO

1123
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
USE IN HOPEFULLY PAINTING THE

1124
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
COMPLETE PICTURE AS TO HOW AND

1125
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
MORE IMPORTANTLY WHY THIS

1126
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
OCCURRED.

1127
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
>> Reporter: POLICE WON'T SAY

1128
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
THAT WHAT EVIDENCE IS.

1129
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
HOWEVER, INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN

1130
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
CHECKING OUT GUN RANGES AND

1131
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
SPORTING GOODS STORES.

1132
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
THEY FOLLOWED A LEAD THE SHOOTER

1133
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
TRIED TO BUY A GUN TUESDAY AT

1134
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
THIS LOCATION.

1135
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
AFTER SEARCHING STORE

1136
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
SURVEILLANCE VIDEOS, THE TIP

1137
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
DIDN'T PAN OUT.

1138
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
>> TO DATE, ATF HAS NOT

1139
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
UNCOVERED ANY INFORMATION THAT

1140
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
WOULD SUBSTANTIATE THE FACT THAT

1141
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
HE TRIED TO ACQUIRE GUNS

1142
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
RECENTLY.

1143
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
WE'RE ACTIVELY INVESTIGATING.

1144
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
>> Reporter: FEDERAL GUN AGENTS

1145
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
ALSO SAID THEY RECOVERED WEAPONS

1146
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
AT THE HOME THE SHOOTER SHARED

1147
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
FROM HIS MOTHER.

1148
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
SOURCES SAY THREE MORE GUNS WERE
FOUND.

1149
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
THESE THREE RIFLE MODELS, ALL

1150
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
OLDER ARE BEING TRACED.

1151
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
AT LEAST ONE HAS BEEN CONNECTED

1152
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
TO THE MOTHER.

1153
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
THREE MORE WEAPONS WERE

1154
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
DISCOVERED WITH THE SHOOTER IN A

1155
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
CLASSROOM WHERE HE TOOK HIS OWN

1156
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
LIFE.

1157
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
ACCORDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

1158
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
OFFICIALS, THE TWO HANDGUNS AND

1159
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC LONG GUN CALLED A

1160
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
BUSHMASTER WERE BOUGHT LEGALLY

1161
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
BY HIS MOTHER.

1162
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER SAYS

1163
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
THAT LONG GUN WAS USED TO KILL

1164
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
SEVERAL VICTIMS.

1165
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
>> I ONLY DID SEVEN OF THE

1166
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
AUTOPSIES.

1167
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
THE VICTIMS I HAD RANGED FROM

1168
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
THREE TO 11 WOUNDS APIECE.

1169
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I ONLY SAW TWO OF THEM WITH

1170
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
POSTRANGE SHOOTING.

1171
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
ALL THE WOUNDS THAT I KNOW OF AT

1172
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
THIS POINT WERE CAUSED BY THE
LONG WEAPON.

1173
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
>> Reporter: ONE RELATIVE

1174
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
DESCRIBES THE SHOOTER AS BEING A

1175
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
VERY BRIGHT YOUNG MAN WHO AT

1176
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
TIMES WAS HOMESCHOOLED BY HIS

1177
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
MOTHER.

1178
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL TELLS

1179
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
US THAT HIS OLDER BROTHER SAYS

1180
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
THAT HIS YOUNGER BROTHER WAS
AUTISTIC.

1181
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
BUT SO FAR, NOTHING ADDS UP TO A

1182
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
MOTIVE.

1183
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN, NEWTOWN,

1184
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
CONNECTICUT.

1185
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
>> THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER HAS

1186
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
EMERGED AS ONE OF THE MORE

1187
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
MYSTERIOUS FIGURES IN THE
INVESTIGATION.

1188
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
HER SON APPARENTLY USED ONE OF

1189
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
HER OWN GUNS TO KILL HER.

1190
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
BUT THERE'S STILL SO MUCH WE

1191
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
DON'T KNOW ABOUT HER.

1192
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
CNN'S DAVID ARIOSTO JOINS US NOW

1193
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
WITH WHAT'S NEW ON THIS.

1194
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
DAVID, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
NANCY LANZA?

1195
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
>> RIGHT HERE, WE'RE HERE IN

1196
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
FRONT OF NANCY LANZA'S HOUSE.

1197
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
IT'S A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN

1198
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
THE ROAD.

1199
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
WE'VE BEEN DIGGING ON THAT VERY

1200
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
QUESTION.

1201
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
IT'S AN INCOMPLETE PICTURE AS TO

1202
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
WHO THIS WOMAN REALLY WAS.

1203
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
WE SPOKE WITH NEIGHBORS IN THE
AREA HERE.

1204
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
MANY OF THEM HAVE RECALLED A

1205
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
PERSON WHO IS A VERY PLEASANT

1206
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
PERSON TO TALKING WITH, LOVED

1207
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
GARDENING, LOVED LANDSCAPING.

1208
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
WOULD OFTEN ATTEND THESE SORT OF

1209
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
DICE GAME, LADIES NIGHT

1210
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
GET-TOGETHERS EVERY SO OFTEN,

1211
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
PERHAPS EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS.

1212
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
SHE WAS THE KIND OF WOMAN THAT

1213
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
SORT OF LEANED ON HER NEIGHBORS

1214
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
BUT WAS ONLY REALLY FAMILIAR

1215
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
WITH SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS IN

1216
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY.

1217
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
YOU KIND OF THINK OF YOUR OWN

1218
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
NEIGHBORHOOD AND HOW MANY

1219
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
NEIGHBORS YOU ACTUALLY KNOW

1220
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
OUTSIDE THOSE INITIAL FEW

1221
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
BLOCKS.

1222
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
SO THE NEIGHBORS THAT WE DID GET

1223
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
TO SPEAK WITH DID GET TO KNOW

1224
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
NANCY, BUT IT'S REALLY NOT ALL

1225
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
THAT CLEAR WHAT WAS BEHIND THE

1226
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
SCENES.

1227
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
SHE MOVED HERE IN 1998 WITH HER

1228
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
HUSBAND.
THEY HAD TWO BOYS.

1229
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
SHE LATER DIVORCED AND RAISED

1230
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
HER TWO BOYS IN THIS AREA.

1231
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
WHAT TRANSPIRED LATER, HOWEVER,

1232
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
IS REALLY SOMEWHAT UNCLEAR

1233
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
BECAUSE THERE'S THIS OTHER SIDE

1234
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
TO NANCY.

1235
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
SHE HAD SEVERAL GUNS AND ONE

1236
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
INDIVIDUAL THAT I SPOKE TO, A

1237
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
BUSINESS OWNER, SAID THAT AT ONE

1238
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
POINT SHE EVEN BRANDISHED A

1239
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
RIFLE THAT SHE HAD RECENTLY

1240
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
PURCHASED.

1241
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
THIS INDIVIDUAL ALSO SAID THAT

1242
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
SHE WOULD GO TARGET SHOOTING.

1243
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THAT OCCURRED

1244
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
AT A RANGE OR JUST AROUND ON

1245
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
CERTAIN TREES OR WHAT ACTUALLY

1246
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
HE MEANT BY THAT.

1247
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
BUT THEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ATF

1248
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
AND FBI OFFICIALS SAID

1249
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
ESSENTIALLY THAT WASN'T THE

1250
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
CASE.

1251
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
THEY WEREN'T AT A SHOOTING
RANGE.

1252
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
THAT DIDN'T OCCUR.

1253
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
BUT REALLY WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

1254
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
HERE ARE TRYING TO GET ANSWERS

1255
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
TO IS JUST WHAT MOTIVATED HER
SON TO DO THIS?

1256
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
WHAT TRANSPIRED INSIDE THE

1257
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
HOUSE -- AND THERE'S A LOT OF

1258
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
PEOPLE REALLY REELING FROM THIS

1259
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
AND LEFT WITH THIS SORT OF A

1260
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
SPEECHLESS QUALITY ABOUT IT,

1261
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
EVEN A DAY AFTER.

1262
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I KNOW MYSELF, I WENT DOWN TO

1263
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
THE FIREHOUSE JUST YESTERDAY AS

1264
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
FAMILIES WERE COMING OUT OF THIS

1265
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
FIREHOUSE THAT WAS MEANT TO BE A

1266
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
WEIGH STATION.

1267
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
AND TOWARD THE EARLY MORNING

1268
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
HOURS OF THAT TUMULTUOUS DAY,

1269
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
YOU'D SEE FAMILIES WALKING OUT

1270
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
WITH LOVED ONES, CHILDREN WHO

1271
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
WERE TEARY-EYED, SHAKEN BUT

1272
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
CLEARLY THEY WERE WALKING OUT

1273
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

1274
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
AND AS THE DAY PROGRESSED, THESE

1275
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
FAMILIES WOULD WALK OUT

1276
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
CHILDLESS.

1277
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THESE

1278
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
THINGS THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

1279
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
AN EASY END EVEN AS THE DAYS --

1280
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
>> AND DAVID, CLEARLY IT BREAKS

1281
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
YOUR HEART.

1282
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
AS YOU SAID, THERE ARE A LOT OF

1283
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.

1284
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
THERE WERE SOME INITIAL REPORTS

1285
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
THAT SHE, NANCY LANZA,

1286
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
ORIGINALLY WORKED FOR THE

1287
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
SCHOOL.

1288
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
BUT THAT ISN'T TRUE, IS IT?

1289
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
>> A LOT OF INFORMATION COMING

1290
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
IN FROM ALL ANGLES HERE THAT WE
GET IN.

1291
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
IT SEEMS CREDIBLE.

1292
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
AND THEN IT TURNS OUT NOT TO BE

1293
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
THE CASE.

1294
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
THERE WERE SOME INITIAL LOCAL

1295
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
REPORTS THAT INDICATED THAT SHE

1296
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
MIGHT HAVE WORKED IN THE SCHOOL
SYSTEM.

1297
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
WHAT WE LATER FOUND OUT IS THAT

1298
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
SHE ACTUALLY HAD A BACKGROUND IN

1299
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
FINANCE AND HAD TAKEN SOME TIME

1300
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
OFF AND WAS STAYING HERE.

1301
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
WHAT HER CONNECTION WAS TO THE

1302
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
SCHOOL IS UNCLEAR.

1303
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
IF THERE'S ANY, WHICH ALSO

1304
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
RAISES MORE QUESTIONS AS TO WHY

1305
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
HER SON CHOSE THIS SCHOOL TO GO

1306
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
IN AND COMMIT THIS HEINOUS ACT.

1307
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
>> DAVID ARIOSTO, THANK YOU VERY

1308
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
MUCH FOR YOUR REPORTING.

1309
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
WE KNOW THE SHOOTER HAD THREE

1310
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
GUNS WITH HIM INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

1311
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
THOSE GUNS WERE REGISTERED TO

1312
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
HIS MOTHER.

1313
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW HE GOT

1314
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
THEM.

1315
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
SO CAN ANYONE BE HELD

1316
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DEADLY

1317
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
ATTACK?

1318
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
KAREN CONTI IS A TRIAL ATTORNEY

1319
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
IN CHICAGO.

1320
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
CAN WE EXPECT LAWSUITS TO BE

1321
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
FILED AND AGAINST WHOM?

1322
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
>> LAWSUITS GET FILED FOR A LOT

1323
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
OF REASONS OTHER THAN MONEY

1324
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY MONEY DOESN'T

1325
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
REPLACE CHILDREN.

1326
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE FILE LAWSUITS TO

1327
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
GET INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN'T

1328
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
OTHERWISE GET THROUGH THE

1329
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
AUTHORITIES.

1330
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
SOMETIMES THEY JUST WANT TO
BLAME SOMEONE FOR AND HOLD

1331
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
SOMEONE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE

1332
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
SENSELESS VIOLENCE.

1333
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
AND SOMETIMES THEY JUST WANT TO

1334
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
CHANGE THINGS IN THE FUTURE,

1335
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
MAYBE CHANGE THE LAWS AND THE

1336
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
SAFETY PROCEDURES.

1337
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
SO JUST A NOTE ABOUT THAT, THE

1338
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
PARENTS WHO ARE ANGRY AND UPSET

1339
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
ABOUT THESE THINGS WILL BRING
LAWSUITS.

1340
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
NOW, I JUST DON'T SEE A VIABLE

1341
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
LAWSUIT HERE BECAUSE WHO ARE YOU

1342
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
GOING TO SUE?

1343
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
THE SCHOOL SEEMED LIKE THEY DID

1344
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
A GREAT JOB, THEY HAD THE

1345
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
PRECAUTIONS IN PLACE.

1346
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
THIS WAS AN ADULT PERSON WHO DID

1347
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
THIS.

1348
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
YOU CAN'T HOLD THE PARENTS

1349
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
RESPONSIBLE.

1350
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I DON'T REALLY SEE A VALID

1351
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
LAWSUIT.

1352
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
>> YEAH.
THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION

1353
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
BECAUSE THE LEGAL DEFENSE HERE

1354
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
WOULD BE THE FACT THAT THE

1355
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
SUSPECT IS OVER THE AGE OF 18.

1356
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
HE IS AN ADULT.

1357
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
THEREFORE, HE'S THE ONLY ONE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS.

1358
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
BUT THEY WERE NOT HIS GUNS.

1359
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
MAYBE HE SHOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN

1360
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
ACCESS TO THE GUNS.

1361
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
BUT THE PERSON THE GUNS BELONGED

1362
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
TO IS NOW DECEASED.

1363
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1364
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE

1365
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
FAMILIES COULDN'T SUE THE ESTATE
OF THE MOTHER.

1366
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PROVE

1367
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
THAT SHE IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR

1368
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
FORM KNEW THAT HE HAD THE

1369
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
PROPENSITY TO DO THIS AND THIS

1370
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
INDIVIDUAL HAD ASPERGER'S

1371
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
SYNDROME, WHICH IS A FORM OF

1372
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
AUTISM.

1373
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
BUT IT HAS NO RELATION TO

1374
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
VIOLENCE.

1375
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
BUT IF SHE HAD PRIOR

1376
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
KNOWLEDGE -- BUT EVEN THAT IS

1377
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
VERY TENUOUS.

1378
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
>> IN OREGON, WE SAW THE GUNS

1379
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
BEING STOLEN.

1380
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
WE SAW HERE THE GUNS BELONGED TO

1381
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
THE MOTHER AND HE GOT ACCESS TO

1382
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
THE GUNS.

1383
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE SOME

1384
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
CHANGES IN THE LAW HERE BECAUSE

1385
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
OF WHAT HAPPENED?

1386
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
>> I THINK WHAT WE SAW IN

1387
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
CONNECTICUT IS JUST PRIOR TO

1388
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
THIS, AFTER THE AURORA,

1389
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
COLORADO, THEATER SHOOTING, THEY

1390
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
TRIED TO CHANGE THE LAWS AND

1391
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE STRINGENT.

1392
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
BUT THERE WAS SUCH PROTEST THAT

1393
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
IT ALL GOT STRICKEN DOWN.

1394
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I DO SEE, THOUGH, THAT WE HAVE A

1395
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
LAW IN ILLINOIS CALLED THE

1396
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
ILLINOIS SCHOOL SAFETY DRILL ACT
WHICH REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO

1397
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
ANNUALLY HAVE DRILLS TO KIND OF

1398
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
PREPARE FOR NOT ONLY THESE KINDS

1399
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
OF THINGS BUT WEATHER ISSUES,

1400
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
TORNADOES, FIRES AND THE LIKE,

1401
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
EVACUATION PROCEDURES IN PLACE,

1402
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
P.A. SYSTEMS, ET CETERA.

1403
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE A

1404
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
MASSIVE AMOUNT OF LEGISLATION

1405
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY REQUIRING

1406
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
SCHOOLS TO DO THIS.

1407
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
>> KAREN CONTI, THANK YOU.

1408
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
EARLIER ONE OF THE MOST

1409
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
COMPELLING MOMENTS OF THIS

1410
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
TRAGEDY, A FATHER WHO LOST HIS

1411
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
DAUGHTER IN THE SHOOTING,

1412
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
BRAVELY TELLS THE WORLD ABOUT

1413
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
THE LITTLE GIRL THAT NOT ONLY HE

1414
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
LOST BUT ONE OF THE MANY THAT WE

1415
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
ALL LOST.
THAT'S NEXT.

1416
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
PROGRESSIVE DIRECT AND OTHER
CAR INSURANCE COMPANIES?
YES.

1417
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
BUT YOU'RE PROGRESSIVE,
AND THEY'RE THEM.
YES.

1418
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
BUT THEY'RE HERE.
YES.

1419
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000

00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
YES.
NO.

1421

ARE YOU THEM?
I'M ME.

1422
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
BUT THOSE RATES
ARE FOR...        THEM.

1423
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
SO THEM ARE HERE.

1424
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
YES!

1425
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
YOU WANT TO RUN
THROUGH IT AGAIN?

1426
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
NO, I'M GOOD.
YOU GOT IT?

1427
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
YES.

1428
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
RATES FOR US AND THEM --
NOW THAT'S PROGRESSIVE.

CALL OR CLICK TODAY.

1430
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000

1431
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
TODAY'S DEVELOPMENTS IN NEWTOWN,
CONNECTICUT.

1432
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA COMING
HERE TOMORROW TO MEET WITH THE

1433
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
VICTIMS' FAMILIES.

1434
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
HE'S ALSO EXPECTED TO ATTEND AN

1435
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
INTERFAITH VIGIL SCHEDULED TO BE

1436
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
HELD TOMORROW EVENING.

1437
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
THE SHOOTER'S FATHER, PETER

1438
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
LANZA, ISSUED A STATEMENT

1439
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
TONIGHT OFFERING HIS CONDOLENCES

1440
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
TO THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES.

1441
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
AND WE HAVE LEARNED MORE ABOUT

1442
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
THE VICTIMS INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

1443
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
SIX WOMEN AND 20 STUDENTS DIED

1444
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
THERE.

1445
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
12 GIRLS, EIGHT BOYS, ALL 6 OR 7

1446
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
YEARS OLD.

1447
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
THE STATE'S CHIEF MEDICAL

1448
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
EXAMINER SAYS ALL OF THEM DIED

1449
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
FROM GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

1450
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE

1451
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
NOW TRYING TO EMOTIONALLY HANDLE

1452
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
THIS TRAGEDY, FRIENDS, FAMILY

1453
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
AND RESIDENTS OF NEWTOWN,

1454
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
CONNECTICUT, TRYING TO START

1455
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
DOWN THAT ROAD TO RECOVERY RIGHT

1456
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
NOW.
OUR DR. SANJAY GUPTA VISITED A

1457
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
GRIEF CENTER TODAY AND HE TALKED

1458
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
TO SOME OF THEM.

1459
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
LISTEN TO WHAT HE TOLD ANDERSON

1460
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
EARLIER.

1461
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
>> WHEN WE GOT THERE, THERE WERE

1462
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
LITERALLY 100 CARS IN THE

1463
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
PARKING LOT.

1464
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
WE WEREN'T FILMING ANYTHING OUT

1465
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
OF RESPECT FOR PEOPLE'S PRIVACY.

1466
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
BUT PEOPLE WERE WALKING OUT WITH

1467
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
CHILDREN, PROBABLY CHILDREN FROM

1468
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
THE SCHOOL, A LOT OF PARENTS

1469
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
WALKING WITH THEM INTO THE

1470
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
SCHOOL.

1471
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
AND THERE WERE PSYCHIATRISTS,

1472
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS, CHILDREN'S

1473
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
COUNSELORS IN THE SCHOOL.

1474
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I THINK WHAT WAS STRIKING IS

1475
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
PEOPLE WERE GOING IN AND THEY

1476
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
WERE STAYING IN FOR A LONG TIME.

1477
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
THIS WAS SORT OF A GRIEVING BUT

1478
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
ALSO HEALING GOING ON.

1479
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
ALSO THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT THE

1480
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
COMMUNITY WAS SORT OF AN

1481
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
INDIVIDUAL, MEANING THAT YOU SAW

1482
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
THAT SOMEONE ELSE WAS GOING

1483
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
THROUGH THE SAME THING YOU WERE.

1484
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
AND PEOPLE WERE BEING COMFORTED

1485
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
BY THAT IN SOME WAY.

1486
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
>> IT'S INTERESTING.

1487
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I WAS TALKING TO MY MOM WHO LOST

1488
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
A SON, MY BROTHER.

1489
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
AND SHE WAS SANG FOR HER, IT

1490
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
HELPED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

1491
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
AND I'VE HEARD THAT FROM A LOT

1492
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
OF PEOPLE HERE, THAT IT HELPS TO

1493
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
TALK.
AND YET OTHER PEOPLE KIND OF

1494
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
AREN'T READY TO TALK ABOUT IT OR

1495
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT AT THIS

1496
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
POINT.
YEAH.

1497
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I THINK THE TIMING SEEMS TO BE

1498
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE

1499
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
WHICH IS WHY I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

1500
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
TO EXPECT WHEN I WENT TO THAT

1501
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
CRISIS CENTER TODAY.

1502
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THIS COMMUNITY

1503
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
FOR THE MOST PART IS READY TO

1504
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
TALK.
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SMALL SAMPLE

1505
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
SIZE.

1506
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
BUT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT.

1507
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
AND THE FEELING OF ISOLATION,

1508
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
THINKING THAT I'M GOING THROUGH

1509
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
THIS ALONE, THAT NO ONE QUITE

1510
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
UNDERSTANDS WHAT THIS HAS DONE
TO ME CAN BE QUITE PAINFUL AND

1511
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
QUITE DAMAGING LONG TERM AS

1512
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
WELL.

1513
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
IF YOU SEE OTHER PEOPLE GOING

1514
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
THROUGH IT -- EVEN JUST BEING

1515
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
THERE IN THE CRISIS CENTER WITH

1516
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
OTHER PEOPLE, I THINK, SEEMED TO

1517
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
BE THERAPEUTIC FOR THEM.

1518
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
>> AND A LOT OF PARENTS HERE AND

1519
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
AROUND THE WORLD ARE TRYING TO

1520
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
FIGURE OUT HOW TO TALK TO THEIR

1521
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
KIDS ABOUT IT.

1522
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I TALKED TO SOME PARENTS LAST

1523
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
NIGHT WHOSE KIDS WERE IN THE

1524
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
SCHOOL AND THANKFULLY HAD

1525
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
SURVIVED.

1526
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
AND THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE

1527
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
WAITING FOR THEIR CHILD TO KIND

1528
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
OF BRING IT UP TO THEM.

1529
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
AND THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT.

1530
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
>> YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THEY

1531
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
KNOW.

1532
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
OBVIOUSLY THE CHILDREN IN THE

1533
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
SCHOOL KNOW.
BUT EVEN OTHER CHILDREN IN THE

1534
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
COMMUNITY KNOW, EVEN IF THEY

1535
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
HAVEN'T BEEN WATCHING TELEVISION

1536
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
JUST IN TODAY'S DAY AND AGE.

1537
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
THE THING THAT KEEPS COMING BACK

1538
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
IS THEY SORT OF DIRECT THE

1539
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
CONVERSATION.

1540
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
SO YOU SORT OF GET YOUR OWN

1541
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
FEELINGS IN CHECK FIRST AS AN

1542
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
ADULT OR AS A PARENT.

1543
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
AND THEN YOU FILL IN DETAILS AS

1544
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
APPROPRIATE, AS AGE APPROPRIATE,

1545
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
LEAVING OUT OBVIOUSLY GRAPHIC

1546
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
DETAILS.

1547
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
BUT THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT YOU

1548
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
DON'T WANT TO BE FALSE OR YOU

1549
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
WANT TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT IN

1550
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
TERMS OF WHAT YOU TELL THEM -- I

1551
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH MY

1552
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
DAUGHTER.

1553
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
SHE STARTED ASKING ABOUT SOME OF

1554
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
THE NAMES OF THE CHILDREN.

1555
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THEY

1556
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
IMMEDIATELY WANT TO HUMANIZE

1557
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
THIS IN SOME WAY FOR THEMSELVES.

1558
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
IT'S A TOUGH CONVERSATION TO

1559
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
HAVE.

1560
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
SHE WANTED TO KNOW IF HER SCHOOL

1561
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
WAS GOING TO BE SAFE.

1562
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I HAD TO SAY, LOOK, DADDY'S

1563
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
SCHOOL NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN TO
HIM.

1564
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
MOMMY'S SCHOOL NEVER HAD IT

1565
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
HAPPEN TO HER.

1566
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
BUT THIS OBVIOUSLY HAPPENED.

1567
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
WE DO THE BEST WE CAN TO KEEP

1568
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
YOU SAFE.

1569
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
IT'S TOUGH BUT AN IMPORTANT

1570
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
CONVERSATION.

1571
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
>> AND ONE FATHER REFUSES TO
THINK OF HIS DAUGHTER AS JUST

1572
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
THE VICTIM OF A HORRIBLE CRIME.

1573
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
THIS IS HOW ROBBIE PARKER SAYS

1574
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
HE'LL REMEMBER HIS 6-YEAR-OLD

1575
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
LITTLE GIRL.

1576
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
>> I'D REALLY LIKE TO OFFER OUR

1577
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO THE

1578
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
FAMILIES WHO WERE DIRECTLY

1579
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
AFFECTED BY THIS SHOOTING.

1580
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
IT'S AN HORRIFIC TRAGEDY AND WE

1581
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT OUR

1582
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO OUT TO

1583
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
THEM.

1584
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
THIS INCLUDES THE FAMILY OF THE

1585
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
SHOOTER.

1586
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD THIS

1587
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
EXPERIENCE MUST BE FOR YOU AND I

1588
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR FAMILY

1589
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
AND OUR LOVE AND OUR SUPPORT

1590
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
GOES OUT TO YOU AS WELL.

1591
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
MY DAUGHTER, EMILIE, WOULD BE

1592
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE

1593
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
STANDING AND GIVING HER LOVE AND

1594
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
SUPPORT TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS

1595
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF

1596
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
PERSON THAT SHE IS, NOT BECAUSE

1597
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
OF ANY PARENTING THAT MY WIFE

1598
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
AND I COULD HAVE DONE, BUT

1599
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE GIFTS

1600
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY HER

1601
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
HEAVENLY FATHER.

1602
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I HAVE TWO REALLY GOOD FRIENDS

1603
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
AT HOME WHO HAVE SET UP A

1604
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
FACEBOOK PAGE TO HELP RAISE

1605
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
MONEY FOR EMILIE.

1606
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
WHEN I'VE GOTTEN ON THAT AND

1607
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
SEEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

1608
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
HAVE COMMENTED AND EXPRESSED

1609
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
THEIR CONDOLENCES, IT'S BEEN

1610
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
QUITE OVERWHELMING.

1611
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

1612
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

1613
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

1614
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

1615
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
WAS AND HOW MANY LIVES THAT SHE

1616
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
WAS ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT

1617
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
TIME HERE ON EARTH.

1618
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

1619
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
VERY LOVING.

1620
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
EMILIE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO TRY

1621
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
NEW THINGS, OTHER THAN FOOD.

1622
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
SHE LOVED TO USE HER TALENTS TO

1623
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
TOUCH THE LIVES OF EVERYONE THAT

1624
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
SHE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH.

1625
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
SHE WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL ARTIST

1626
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
AND SHE ALWAYS CARRIED AROUND

1627
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
HER MARKERS AND PENCILS SO SHE

1628
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
NEVER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO

1629
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
DRAW A PICTURE OR MAKE A CARD

1630
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
FOR THOSE AROUND HER.

1631
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF

1632
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
TIMES EMILIE NOTICED SOMEONE

1633
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
FEELING SAD OR FRUSTRATED AND

1634
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
WOULD RUSH TO FIND A PIECE OF

1635
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
PAPER TO DRAW THEM A PICTURE OR

1636
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
TO WRITE THEM AN ENCOURAGING

1637
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
NOTE.

1638
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
EMILIE'S CARD MAKING WAS

1639
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
EXPRESSED BEAUTIFULLY THIS LAST

1640
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
OCTOBER WHEN SHE PLACED A VERY

1641
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
SPECIAL CARD SHE HAD MADE INTO

1642
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
THE CASKET WITH HER GRANDPA, WHO

1643
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
ALSO JUST RECENTLY DIED OF A

1644
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
TRAGIC ACCIDENT.

1645
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER TWO

1646
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
LITTLE SISTERS AND DELIGHTED IN

1647
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ, DANCE

1648
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS IN

1649
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
LIFE.

1650
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
EMILIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS

1651
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE

1652
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
PLEASURE TO MEET HER WOULD AGREE

1653
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
THAT THIS WORLD IS A BETTER

1654
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
PLACE BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN IN IT.

1655
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
SHE WAS THEIR BEST FRIEND.

1656
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
THEY WERE ALL BORN WITHIN THREE

1657
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
YEARS OF EACH OTHER SO BY LAW,

1658
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE.

1659
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
SHE WAS TEACHING MY MIDDLE

1660
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
DAUGHTER TO READ.

1661
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
SHE WOULD HELP MY YOUNGEST
DAUGHTER LEARN HOW TO MAKE

1662
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
THINGS, SHOW HER HOW TO DO
CRAFTS.

1663
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
THEY LOOKED UP TO HER AND THEY

1664
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
LOOKED TO HER WHEN THEY NEEDED

1665
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
COMFORT.

1666
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
USUALLY THAT'S SAVED FOR A MOM

1667
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
AND A DAD.

1668
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
BUT IT WAS REALLY SWEET TO SEE

1669
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
THE TIMES WHEN ONE OF THEM WOULD

1670
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
FALL OR GET THEIR FEELINGS HURT,

1671
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
HOW THEY WOULD RUN TO EMILIE TO

1672
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
GET SUPPORT AND HUGS AND KISSES.

1673
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT

1674
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
COULD JUST LIGHT UP A ROOM.

1675
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING KIND TO

1676
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
SAY ABOUT ANYBODY.

1677
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
AND HER LOVE AND THE STRENGTH

1678
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
THAT SHE GAVE US AND THE EXAMPLE

1679
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
THAT SHE SHOWED TO US IS

1680
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
REMARKABLE.

1681
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON.

1682
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
AND I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER

1683
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
DAD.

1684
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I WAS LEAVING TO WORK AND SHE

1685
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT.

1686
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
AND I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TEACHING

1687
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
HER PORTUGUESE.

1688
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
SO OUR LAST CONVERSATION WAS IN

1689
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
PORTUGUESE.

1690
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
AND SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING.

1691
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

1692
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I SAID THAT I WAS DOING WELL.

1693
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME.

1694
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT

1695
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
THE DOOR.

1696
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
FREE AGENCY IS GIVEN TO ALL OF

1697
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
US TO ACT AND DO WHAT WE WANT.

1698
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM

1699
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
US.

1700
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

1701
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
THAT HE WAS GIVEN AND THAT'S

1702
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
WHAT HE CHOSE TO DO WITH IT.

1703
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I KNOW THAT GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT

1704
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
AWAY.

1705
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I'M NOT MAD BECAUSE I HAVE MY

1706
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
AGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT I USE

1707
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
THIS EVENT TO DO WHAT I CAN TO
