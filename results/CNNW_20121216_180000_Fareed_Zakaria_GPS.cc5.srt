INTENDED TO FRIGHTEN OUR NATION

TO CHAOS AND RETREAT, BUT THEY

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000

OUR COUNTRY IS STRONG.

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000

THE FORCES THAT DIVIDE US ARE

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000

BY THE WAY HAD SECURITY.

132
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
YOU HAD TO BE BUZZED INTO THE

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
SCHOOL.

134
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THERE WERE SECURITY CAMERAS

135
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000

HERE'S HOW THE GOVERNOR PUTS IT.

143
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
>> WHAT WE KNOW IS HE SHOT HIS

144
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
WAY INTO THE BUILDING.

145
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
HE WASN'T BUZZED IN.

146
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
HE SHOT HIS WAY IN BY SHOOTING

147
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
AN ENTRANCE INTO THE BUILDING.

148
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
THAT'S WHAT AN ASSAULT WEAPON

149
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
CAN DO FOR YOU.

150
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000

HIS WAY INTO THIS SCHOOL.

156
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
A LOT OF SCHOOLS HAVE THIS KIND

157
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
OF SECURITY AND NOW IT LEAVES

158
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
LOTS OF QUESTIONS, HOW SECURE

159
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
REALLY IS THAT SECURITY SYSTEM,

160
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000

THREE TO 11 TIMES EACH.

172
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
THIS IS REALLY HARD STUFF TO
HEAR.

173
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
ALL OF THE CHILDREN WERE 6 OR 7

WEAPONS AND WHO OWNED THESE

FAMILIES.
IT'S SO -- I'M NOT EVEN INVOLVED

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
IN THIS, AND IT'S HARD TO GET

214
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
WORDS OUT WITHOUT EVEN CRYING.

215
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000

DIRECTLY AND -- BUT I THINK THE

218
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
WORST PART OF THIS, ASIDE FROM

219
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
LOSING ALL OUR ANGELS AND SOME

220
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
AMAZING ADULTS IN OUR SCHOOL, IS

221
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
THAT THIS SCHOOL WAS SO CLOSE

222
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
AND WE HAD SUCH AN AMAZING SET

223
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
OF STAFF AND STUDENTS AND PARENT

224
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
VOLUNTEERS AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE

225
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN IN AN

226
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE WAS SO

227
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
MUCH LOVE AND JOY, EVERYONE JUST

228
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
FEELS VIOLATED.

229
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I -- AS SOMEONE, I WAS ACTUALLY

230
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
INVOLVED IN THE SCHOOL FOR 17

231
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
YEARS, AND I JUST STOPPED BEING

232
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
INVOLVED LAST SPRING AND I

233
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
WORKED WITH THE CHILDREN ON A

234
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
WEEKLY BASIS ON A NEWSPAPER

235
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
PROGRAM.
ALL MY CHILDREN WENT THROUGH THE

236
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
PROGRAM.
IT'S JUST -- IT'S UNBELIEVABLE

237
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN TO A

238
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
LITTLE SCHOOL THAT HAD SO MUCH

239
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
LOVE AND JOY IN IT.

240
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
>> WHY DID YOU FEEL IT WAS

241
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
IMPORTANT TO SPEAK OUT NOW?

242
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
>> BECAUSE I NEED THE COUNTRY

243
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
AND THE WORLD TO UNDERSTAND THAT

244
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
OUT OF THIS, BE WE HAVE TO BRING

245
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
GOOD.
THIS WAS AN IDYLLIC SETTING FOR

246
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
CHILDREN AND NOW CHILDREN,

247
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
YOUNG, YOUNG CHILDREN HAVE DIED.

248
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
WE KEEP SEEING THIS IN OUR

249
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
COUNTRY.
WHEN COLUMBINE HAPPENED OUR

250
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
SCHOOL PUT IN A BUZZER SYSTEM.

251
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
A FEW MONTHS AGO WAS AURORA.

252
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
THIS KEEPS HAPPENING AND I WANT

253
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
THE DEATHS OF THESE LITTLE

254
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
CHILDREN, SOME OF THEM SIBLINGS

255
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
OF MY CHILDREN'S FRIENDS, TO

256
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
HAVE MEANING.

257
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
INITIALLY AS A COMMUNITY WE'RE

258
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
GOING TO GIVE THOSE DEATHS

259
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
MEANING THROUGH THE LOVE THAT WE

260
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
GIVE TO ALL THE VICTIMSES AND

261
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL DOING.

262
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
MEALS HAVE BEEN SET UP.

263
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
EVERYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE.

264
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
BUT BEYOND THAT, GOOD MUST COME

265
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
OF THIS TRAGEDY.

266
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
>> YEAH.

267
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I HAD BEEN TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE

268
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
AND EXPLAIN TO THE AUDIENCE AND

269
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA JUST HOW

270
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
DIFFICULT IT IS TO BE HERE AND

271
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE MEDIA,

272
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
BUT THIS IS OUR JOBS.

273
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
>> RIGHT.

274
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
>> BUT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE

275
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
HERE AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

276
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
AFFECTED BY THIS, WHEN YOU LOOK

277
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
AT THIS TOWN, IT LOOKS LIKE A

278
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
CHRISTMAS POSTCARD AND YOU THINK

279
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
ABOUT ALLS THOSE LIVES, THERE'S

280
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
NOT GOING TO BE ANY -- ANOTHER

281
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
PERSON AT CHRISTMAS.

282
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
>> RIGHT.
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ANOTHER

283
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
GRADUATION.

284
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

285
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
>> IT'S BIGGER THAN THAT.

286
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
THIS MEANS THAT THIS SCHOOL THAT

287
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
WAS SUCH A UNIT, ISN'T GOING TO

288
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
EXIST FOR SOME TIME.

289
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
WE'RE MOVING TO MONROE, RIGHT?

290
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
THAT'S WHERE THAT LITTLE SCHOOL

291
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
WILL BE TEMPORARILY.

292
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
IT ALSO HAS RIPPLE AFFECTS OUT.

293
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
THE KIDS IN COLLEGE RIGHT NOW

294
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
THAT WENT TO THAT SCHOOL,

295
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
THEY'RE DEVASTATED BECAUSE THEIR

296
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
MEMORIES OF THAT SCHOOL HAVE

297
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
JUST BEEN CRASHED.

298
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
IT BEGINS WITH THE DEATH OF

299
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
BABIES, AND IT RIPPLES OUT.

300
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
EVERYONE IN NEWTOWN KNOWS EACH

301
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
OTHER.
>> HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN TO THE

302
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT

303
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
CAMERA, WHAT THEY CAN DO?

304
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
EVERYBODY'S ASKING ME, WHAT CAN

305
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
WE DO TO HELP?

306
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
CAN WE PRAY?

307
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
OBVIOUSLY PRAYERS WILL HELP.

308
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
BUT WHAT CAN THEY DO, PEOPLE

309
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
WATCHING NOT ONLY IN THE U.S.

310
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
BUT AROUND THE WORLD TO HELP

311
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
THIS COMMUNITY?

312
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
>> I WOULD LIKE EVERYONE TO LEAD

313
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
WITH LOVE AND NOT JUST HELP THE

314
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
TOWN BUT HELP OUR COUNTRY COME

315
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
TO TERMS WITH THESE SITUATIONS.

316
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
SENDING US LOVE AND PRAYERS,

317
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
THAT'S AN AMAZING THING.

318
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'M GETTING IT FROM WHERE I'M

319
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
FROM IN THE MIDWEST AND I CAN'T

320
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THAT AND I KNOW

321
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
ALL MY FRIENDS ARE TOO.

322
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
BUT, WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

323
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
THING WE CAN DO IS LEAD WITH

324
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
LOVE AND THEN LOOK AT OUR

325
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
SITUATION AS A COUNTRY AND SAY,

326
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
DOES IT STOP NOW?

327
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
DO WE HAVE SOLUTIONS?

328
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'M NOT -- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S

329
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
GUN CONTROL, NO MORE GLASS DOORS

330
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
IN SCHOOL BUILDINGS.

331
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
IF THOSE DOORS WEREN'T GLASS

332
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
MAYBE THIS WOULDN'T HAVE

333
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
HAPPENED.
WE AS A COUNTRY HAVE TO USE THIS

334
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
TO COME TOGETHER AND LOOK AT ALL

335
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
THE SOLUTIONS, MENTAL HEALTH,

336
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
EVERYTHING.
SO WHAT CAN THE WORLD DO?

337
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
LOVE EACH OTHER.

338
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
AND WORK TOGETHER AND NO MORE

339
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
GRIDLOCK ON ANYTHING.

340
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
FIGURE THIS OUT SO NO MORE

341
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
6-YEAR-OLDS HAVE TO DIE OR WATCH

342
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
THEIR TEACHER DIE IN THEIR

343
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
CLASSROOM, IN A PLACE THAT HAS

344
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
FOR YEARS BEEN A PLACE OF JOY

345
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
AND LOVE.

346
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
THAT'S JUST WRONG.
IT'S WRONG.

347
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
>> OKAY.

348
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

YOU KNOW SOME OF THE FAMILIES.

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
HOW ARE THEY DOING?

353
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
>> A MESS.

354
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THEY'RE A MESS.

355
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
HOW WOULD YOU DO?
>> YEAH.

THAT'S THE COLD TRUTH!

438
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Capella University understands
back from rough economic times.

439
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Employees are being forced to do
more with less.

440
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And the need for capable leaders
is greater than ever.

441
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
When you see these problems do
you take a step back,

442
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
or do you want to dive right in?

the knowledge to go further in
your career than you ever
thought possible.

WHAT, IF ANYTHING, COULD HAVE

1098
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
THAT'S DOUBLE MILES

1099
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE!

1100
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
HOW ILLUMINATING.

1101
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
WHAT'S IN YOUR WALLET?

1102
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
LET ME GUESS, AM I
ON THE NAUGHTY LIST AGAIN?

1103
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
HO HO HO!

1104
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
LET ME GUESS, AM I
ON THE NAUGHTY LIST AGAIN?

1105
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
...so as you can see, GEICO's
customer satisfaction is at 97%.

1106
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Mmmm tasty.

1107
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And cut! Very good.

1108
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

1109
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

1110
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

1111
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It's not real.

1112
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

1113
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

1114
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

1115
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

SOMBER TRIBUTE TO THE VICTIMS IN

1127
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1128
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
THE TRAGEDY IS TOUGH FOR THE

1129
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND THOSE NOT

1130
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
DIRECTLY AFFECTED STILL WANT TO

1131
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

1132
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
YESTERDAY I SPOKE WITH TWO WOMEN

1133
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
WHO ARE TRYING TO DO JUST THAT.

1134
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
BEFORE YOU ROLL IT, I WANT TO

1135
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
TELL YOU, THAT THOSE WOMEN SAW

1136
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
ME ON TELEVISION, WAS WATCHING

1137
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
CNN AND THEY WROTE ME A NOTE.

1138
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
AND I WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT

1139
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
THIS NOTE SAYS AFTER YOU HEAR

1140
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
FROM THEM.
HERE IT IS.

1141
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
>> WHEN YOU CAME UP TO TALK TO

1142
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
ME, YOU LADIES, YOU COULD BARELY

1143
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
GET THE WORDS OUT.

1144
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
>> THIS IS -- THERE ARE NO

1145
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
WORDS.
THERE ARE NO WORDS.

1146
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
EVEN RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THAT

1147
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
FAMILIES ARE CRYING TOGETHER,

1148
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
TRYING TO GET THROUGH DAY TO

1149
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
DAY, AND WE FEEL THAT SINCE WE

1150
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
WEREN'T DIRECTLY IMPACTED, WE

1151
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
FEEL LIKE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

1152
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
USE OUR VOICES TO SAY THINGS WE

1153
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
KNOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE

1154
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
SAYING FOR A LONG TIME.

1155
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
AFTER THE CAMERAS ARE GONE.

1156
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
SOMETIMES IT'S AFTER THE CAMERAS

1157
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
ARE GONE, THAT THINGS STOP

1158
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
WORKING AND MOTION STOPS.

1159
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
>> FOR YOU?

1160
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
YOU'VE BEEN CRYING THE ENTIRE

1161
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
TIME YOU'RE STANDING HERE.

1162
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
>> THERE ARE NO WORDS.

1163
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
THERE ARE NO ADEQUATE WORDS TO

1164
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
DESCRIBE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE.

1165
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
AND HOW CHILDREN AND PARENTS AND

1166
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
GRANDPARENTS AND UNCLES AND

1167
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
AUNTS AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE FAR

1168
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
AWAY WHO JUST KNOW THAT WE ARE

1169
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
HERE, THERE ARE NO WORDS.

1170
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
AND THIS CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE,

1171
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
ANYWHERE.

1172
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
WE NEED TO MAKE OUR CHILDREN

1173
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
FEEL SAFE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

1174
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW WE CAN DO

1175
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
THAT?

1176
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I WANT SOMEONE TO GIVE US AN

1177
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION.

>> AND BY YOU ASKING, SOME OF

1179
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
THOSE QUESTIONS MAY BE ANSWERED.

1180
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
YOU ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE.

1181
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
YOU ARE HELPING.

>> ARE YOU GOING TO SEND THEM TO

1191
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
SCHOOL?

1192
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
>> I'M GOING TO SEND THEM TO

1193
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
SCHOOL AS LONG AS I CAN TELL

1194
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
THEM THAT SOMEBODY IS DOING

1195
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO MAKE THEM

1196
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
FEEL SAFE.
>> HOW OLD ARE YOUR KIDS?

1197
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
>> MY DAUGHTER IS 11 AND MY SON

1198
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
IS 8.
>> ARE YOU GOING TO SEND THEM TO

1199
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
SCHOOL?

1200
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
>> IF I FEEL -- IF I FEEL

1201
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
THEY'RE SAFE.

1202
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
IF I FEEL THAT THEY'RE SAFE.

1203
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
>> THANK YOU.

1204
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000

I'M SO SORRY.

1206
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000

KIND OF COVERAGE THAT YOU'RE --

1213
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
YOU'VE BEEN VERY SENSITIVE.

1214
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
>> SO, LAURA AND SHELLY, THANK

1215
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
YOU.

1216
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
THIS IS THE NOTE.

1217
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
AND I WANTED THEM TO BE ON

1218
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
CAMERA BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT

1219
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
THEIR VOICES NEEDED TO BE HEARD.

1220
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SHOW THEIR

1221
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
FULL FACES ON CAMERA BECAUSE

1222
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
THEY HAD BEEN CRYING FOR 24

1223
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
HOURS THEY SAID.

1224
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
WE DON'T LOOK WELL.

1225
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
SHOOT US FROM THE SIDE.

1226
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
WE DID THAT.

1227
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
THE NOTE SAYS, EARLIER YOU ASKED

1228
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
SOMEONE BEING INTERVIEWED WHAT

1229
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
WE WOULD WANT OUR COUNTRY TO DO

1230
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

1231
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD LIKE.

1232
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
RIGHT AWAY, WE NEED SPECIFIC

1233
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
PLANS AND ACTIONS TO IMPROVE

1234
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
SAFETY FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR

1235
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
SCHOOLS BEFORE THEY ARE EXPECTED

1236
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
TO RETURN TO SCHOOL.

1237
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
WE FEEL WE COULD BE -- WE COULD

1238
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
BETTER ENSURE OUR CHILDREN'S

1239
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
SAFETY PLACING A PERMANENT

1240
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
POLICE OFFICER IN EACH OF OUR

1241
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
SCHOOLS IN NEWTOWN SO THEY WILL

1242
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
KNOW SOMEONE IS THERE FOR THE

1243
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
PURPOSE OF PROTECTING THEIR

1244
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
SCHOOL.
THEY NEED TO FEEL SAFE AND TO BE

1245
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
SAFE, BE IN CAPITAL LETTERS, BE

1246
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
SAFE AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE.

1247
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT, ARE

1248
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
ACTIONS TOO.

1249
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
ONCE AND FOR ALL, FIND WAYS TO

1250
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
MAKE THESE ACTS NEARLY

1251
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT IN THE

1252
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
FUTURE.

1253
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
THESE ARE THE ONLY WAYS THAT

1254
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
THIS TRAGEDY CAN LEAD TO

1255
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
ANYTHING POSITIVE.

1256
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO

1257
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
THIS FOR THESE VICTIMS AND FOR

1258
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
ALL OF US.

1259
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
SINCERELY.

1260
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
SO THANK YOU, LADIES, FOR THAT

1261
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
AND I THINK THE ENTIRE COUNTRY

1262
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
HEAR YOUR WORDS RIGHT NOW.

1263
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I WANT TO BRING IN CLINICAL

1264
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
PSYCHOLOGIST DR. JEFF GARRDEER,

1265
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
IT'S HARD TO TELL WOMEN LIKE I

1266
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
SPOKE TO NOT TO WORRY, NOT TO

1267
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
WORRY ABOUT SENDING THEIR KIDS

1268
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
TO SCHOOL IN THE FUTURE.

1269
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
FEAR MAY BE A CONSTANT FOR THEM

1270
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
NOW.
HOW DO WE EASE THEIR WORRIES IN

1271
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
THIS MOMENT?

1272
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
>>
>> WELL FIRST OF ALL.

1273
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK YOU,

1274
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
DON, FOR THE SENSITIVE COVERAGE

1275
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
THAT YOU'VE GIVEN AND BEING

1276
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
AWARE THAT WE CAN'T IN ANY WAY,

1277
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
SHALL SHOOTER, MAKE HIM SOME

1278
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
SORT OF AN HISTORICAL FIGURE.

1279
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE WILL FOLLOW

1280
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
THAT AND THAT'S BEEN PART OF THE

1281
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
PROBLEM, SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

1282
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
>> FIRSTnd FOREMOST, YOU'RE

1283
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
CORRECT.

1284
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
FEAR IS GOING TO BE PART OF

1285
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
THEIR LIVES, NOT FOREVER.

1286
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
BUT WE NEED TO REASSURE THOSE

1287
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
CHILDREN THERE IN NEWTOWN, THAT

1288
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
THEY ARE SAFE.

1289
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
THEY MUST RETURN TO THAT SCHOOL,

1290
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
BECAUSE IF THEY AVOID IT, THEN

1291
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
IT WILL BECOME WHAT WE CALL IN

1292
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
PSYCHOLOGY, APHOBIC RESPONSE.

1293
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
SO FIRST AND FOREMOST.

1294
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
THERE SHOULD BE A POLICE

1295
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
OFFICER, A LAW ENFORCEMENT, IN

1296
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
EACH ONE OF THOSE SCHOOLS THERE

1297
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
FOR JUST A TEMPORARY AMOUNT OF

1298
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
TIME.
JUST SO THEY FEEL SAFE.

1299
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
SECONDLY, PARENTS NEED TO GO IN

1300
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
WITH THE CHILDREN, EVERY DAY,

1301
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS, AND AFTER,

1302
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
PROBABLY THROUGH JANUARY.

1303
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
OR HAVE ADULTS THERE THAT ARE

1304
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
TRAINED TO BE WITH THOSE KIDS.

1305
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
AND TO REASSURE THEM, THAT

1306
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
THEY'RE SAFE.

1307
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
THERE NEEDS TO BE SUPPORT

1308
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
GROUPS, MOBILE CRISIS UNITS,

1309
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
THAT ARE PART OF THE FABRIC OF

1310
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
THOSE SCHOOLS THERE.

1311
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
AGAIN, EVERY DAY.

1312
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
THEY NEED TO USE THE HOLIDAYS,

1313
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
THE RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS TO

1314
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
REMEMBER THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN

1315
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
LOST.

1316
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
TO CONTINUE GRIEVING THEIR LOSS.

1317
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

1318
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
THAT FEELS.

1319
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
AND FINALLY, WE NEED TO GET THEM

1320
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
TO HELP ONE ANOTHER.

1321
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
GET THE KIDS TO HELP ONE

1322
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
ANOTHER.
TO EMPOWER THEM.

1323
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO GIVE IN

1324
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
COMPLETELY TO THE ANXIETY.

1325
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
AND THERE WILL BE THE PTSD.

1326
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

1327
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
WITH SO MANY OF THEM.

1328
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
AS WE ADDRESS THEIR ISSUES,

1329
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
RIGHT NOW, THE PROGNOSIS WILL BE

1330
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
BETTER.

1331
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
>> I WENT UP TO THE CAR AND I

1332
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
MET THE KIDS AND SAW THE KIDS.

1333
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I COULD JUST ONLY IMAGINE IN

1334
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
THOSE LITTLE VOICES, THOSE KIDS

1335
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
SAYING MOMMY.

1336
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
DADDY.

1337
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL.

1338
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
HOW, WHAT IF SOMEONE COMES INTO

1339
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
MY SCHOOL.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A CHILD WHO

1340
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
IS ASKING THAT?

1341
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
>> YOU TELL THAT CHILD THAT YOU

1342
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE

1343
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
AFRAID.
AND THAT YOU, AS THE PARENT TO

1344
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
BE HONEST WITH THEM, ARE AFRAID,

1345
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
TOO.

1346
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
BUT IN THIS LIFE, NO MATTER HOW

1347
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
HORRIFIC THINGS MAY TAKE PLACE,

1348
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
WE MUST HELP ONE ANOTHER.

1349
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
AND WE OWE IT TO THOSE KIDS WHO

1350
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
ARE NO LONGER THERE, BECAUSE

1351
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
THERE WILL BE SOME SURVIVOR

1352
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
GUILT.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF

1353
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
PEOPLE HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT.

1354
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
THE WAY TO ATTACK THAT, THE WAY

1355
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
TO DEAL WITH IT, IS BY GOING

1356
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
BACK TO SCHOOL.

1357
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
SO BEING AS GENTLE AND AS

1358
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
RESPONSIVE AND AS UNDERSTANDING

1359
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
AS WE CAN, WITH OUR CHILDREN AND

1360
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
UNDERSTANDING THAT FEAR, BUT

1361
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
TAKING THEM BY THE HAND, NOT

1362
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
FORCING THEM, BUT TOGETHER,

1363
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
GOING IN, AND SAYING, OKAY, I

1364
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
WILL HELP YOU, BUT YOU HELP MOM

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION NOT CAUSED
BY A HEART VALVE PROBLEM,

FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN,

AND MADE A MONTHLY TRIP TO THE
CLINIC TO GET HIS BLOOD TESTED.

1388

BUT NOT ANYMORE.
