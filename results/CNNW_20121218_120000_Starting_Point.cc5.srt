00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
RECENT DAYS FOR GOOD REASON.

87
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
A BIG SHIFT.

96
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS LONG

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
CAMPAIGNED ON THAT NUMBER,

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
FOR HIS PART, SPEAKER BOEHNER

103
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
WHO HAS ALL ALONG REFUSED TO

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
CONSIDER ANY RAISING IN THE TAX

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000

GOOD MORNING, DAN.

>> GOOD MORNING, JOHN.

112
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
THE BIG QUESTION, CAN SPEAKER

113
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
BOEHNER SELL THIS PROPOSAL TO

114
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
HOUSE REPUBLICANS?

115
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THIS IS VERY DRAMATIC, PRESIDENT

116
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
OBAMA HAD ALWAYS DUG IN, SAYING

117
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
THERE WAS NO DEAL UNLESS TAXES

118
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
WENT UP ON HOUSEHOLDS MAKING

119
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
MORE THAN $250,000.

120
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
NOW THE PRESIDENT RAISING THAT

121
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
TO $400,000.

122
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
THIS NEW PROPOSAL OR

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
COUNTERPROPOSAL COMING DURING A

124
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND

126
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER YESTERDAY.

127
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
IT LASTED 45 MINUTES.

128
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
IN ADDITION, THE PRESIDENT

129
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
PROPOSING $1.2 TRILLION IN NEW

130
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
REVENUE.
DOWN FROM 1$1.4 TRILLION AND 1$2

131
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
TRILLION IN SPENDING CUTS.

132
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THIS MEETS THE DEMAND THAT

133
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER HAD FOR AN EQUAL

134
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
AMOUNT OF SPENDING CUTS TO

135
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
REVENUE.
BUT HOUSE REPUBLICAN AIDES SAY

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
WHILE THIS IS A STEP IN THE

137
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
RIGHT DIRECTION, THEY DON'T

138
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT'S MATH

139
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
REALLY ADDS UP.

140
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
BRENDAN BUCK SAYS A PROPOSAL

141
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
THAT INCLUDES $1.3 TRILLION IN

142
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
REVENUE FOR ONLY $930 BILLION IN

143
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
SPENDING CUTS CANNOT BE

144
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
CONSIDERED BALANCED.

145
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
SO STILL SOME DISTANCE HERE

146
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
BETWEEN BOTH SIDES CAN ACTUALLY

147
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
REACH AN AGREEMENT HERE.

148
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
WHITE HOUSE SOURCES SAY THAT

149
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
THIS IS NOT THE FINAL OFFER FROM

150
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
THE PRESIDENT, SIGNALING THERE

151
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
COULD BE SOME ROOM FOR

152
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
COMPROMISE, JOHN.

153
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
>> A BIG DAY FOR SPEAKER BOEHNER

154
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
AS WELL.

155
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
10:00 EASTERN TIME, SCHEDULED TO

156
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
MEET WITH HOUSE REPUBLICAN

157
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
MEMBERS TO UPDATE THEM ON

158
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
NEGOTIATIONS.
REALLY NEEDS TO TAKE THEIR

159
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
TEMPERATURE ON THIS, DOESN'T HE?

160
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
>> HE DOES.

161
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
A LOT OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE

162
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
BEEN UNWILLING TO BUDGE ON

163
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
INCOMES, TAX HIKES GOING UP FOR

164
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
EVEN HIGH-INCOME AMERICANS, AND

165
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
NOW JOHN BOEHNER IS PROPOSAL

166
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
THAT $1 MILLION, THE PRESIDENT

167
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
NOW WITH $400,000.

168
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
AND SO THIS IS A TOUGH SELL FOR

169
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE

170
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
INSISTED THAT THEY WANTED THOSE

171
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
EXTENSIONS TO CONTINUE FOR ALL

172
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
AMERICANS, BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE

173
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
THAT IT WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE

174
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
DOWN TURN PRESSURE ON THE

175
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
ECONOMY.
THEY WILL PUT PRESSURE ON THOSE

176
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
WHO ARE THE JOB CREATORS.

177
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
A BIG SELL.

178
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
INTERESTING TO SEE IF THEY CAN

179
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
CONVINCE THOSE WHO ARE PUSHING

180
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
FORWARD.
>> WE'LL CHECK BACK IN WITH YOU

181
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
A LITTLE BIT.

182
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
DAN LOTHIAN, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.

183
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
>>> BACK

184
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
TO NEWTOWN AND SOLEDAD.

185
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
>> WE MENTIONED THE GUN CONTROL

186
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
DEBATE HAS TAKEN ON NEW URGENCY

187

A BLANK PAGE.

210
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000

SHOT HIS WAY INTO THE SCHOOL.

547
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
AND THAT WAS THE TRUTH.

550
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000

POSNER.

SON.
IT STARTS LIKE THIS "THE SKY IS

PURPOSEFUL LITTLE STEPS STOMPING

BLUE EYES FRAMED BY EYELASHES

837
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
THAT WOULD BE THE ENVY OF ANY

838
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
LADY IN THIS ROOM.
SHE GOES ON AND ENDS BY SAYING

839
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
THIS, I HAD JOIN YOU SOME DAY,

REPRINTED IT THERE.

850
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
AS WE TALKED ABOUT THE TRAGEDY

851
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
BRINGING GUN CONTROL LAWS TO THE

852
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
FOREFRONT, WE WANT TO BRING IN

853
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
JOE MANCHIN, CONSERVATIVE

854
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
DEMOCRAT FROM THE STATE OF

855
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
VIRGINIA, AND FAMOUSLY PRO GUN.

856
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
NICE TO HAVE YOU WITH US, SIR.

857
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT.

858
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
YOU HAVE SAID IT'S NOW TIME TO

859
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
TALK ABOUT GUN CONTROL.

860
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
WHAT DO YOU SPECIFICALLY MEAN?

861
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
>> SOLEDAD, WHAT WE'RE TALKING

862
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
ABOUT, I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY IS

863
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
GRIEVING AS HARD AS WE'RE

864
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
GRIEVING IN WEST VIRGINIA, AND I

865
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE PAIN.

866
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I JUST CAN, AS A PARENT AND

867
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
GRANDPARENT.
SO OUR HEARTS AND PRAYERS ARE

868
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
WITH ALL OF THE FAMILIES AND ALL

869
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
OF THE PEOPLE OF CONNECTICUT.

870
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
NEWTOWN.
I JUST -- I DON'T HAVE WORDS FOR

871
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
THAT.
AND MY SYMPATHIES FOR THEM WITH

872
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
THAT BEING SAID, WE HAVEN'T

873
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
HOPEFULLY BECOME A SOCIETY OR

874
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
BECOME EVEN A GOVERNING BODY

875
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
THAT WE CAN'T SIT DOWN AND TALK.

876
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
WE CAN'T LAY EVERYTHING ON THE

877
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
TABLE TO FIND OUT HOW DO WE MOVE

878
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
FORWARD?
WE HAVE CHALLENGES.

879
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF COLIN

880
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
POWELL'S FIVE PROMISES TO

881
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
CHILDREN.

882
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
SECOND PROMISE, EVERY CHILD

883
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
SHOULD HAVE A SAFE PLACE IN

884
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
THEIR LIFE.

885
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE

886
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
HOME.

887
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
MORE THAN OFTEN, IT'S THE SCHOOL

888
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
AND IT LOOKS LIKE EVEN THAT HAS

889
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
BEEN TAKEN AWAY.

890
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
IT IS TIME TO SIT DOWN, TIME TO

891
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
LOOK AT A RESPONSIBLE,

892
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
REASONABLE APPROACH.

893
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
MENTAL ILLNESS, A CULTURE OF

894
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
VIOLENCE, SOMETIMES ACCEPTED,

895
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
EVEN GLORIFIED AND CERTAIN

896
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS THAT AS A

897
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
HUNTER MYSELF, AS A PROUD

898
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
DEFENDER OF THE SECOND

899
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
AMENDMENT, AS A PROUD MEMBER OF

900
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
THE NRA, WE SHOULD QUESTION.

901
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
AND LOOK AND SEE IF THERE IS A

902
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
BETTER WAY TO DO THIS.

903
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
>> WOULD YOU THEN SUPPORT

904
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD BAN

905
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS.

906
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
WOULD YOU SUPPORT LEGISLATION

907
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
THAT WOULD GET RID OF HIGH

908
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
CAPACITY MAGAZINES?

909
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
>> SOLEDAD, THAT ALL HAS TO COME

910
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
TO THE TABLE.

911
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
IF IT'S A RESPONSIBLE,

912
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
REASONABLE MANNER, I THINK THAT

913
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WOULD

914
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
SUPPORT A REASONABLE APPROACH TO

915
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
THAT.
I HAVE BEEN HUNTING ALL MY LIFE.

916
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I HAVE EVER HAD MULTIPLE ROUNDS

917
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
OF CLIPS OF TEN OR MORE.

918
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
NOT NEEDED.

919
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I NEVER GONE WITH A MILITARY

920
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
STYLE ASSAULT RIFLE HUNTING.

921
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
IT'S NOT NEEDED.

922
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
SO WE NEED TO QUESTION THAT.

923
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
WE NEED TO BRING THE NRA IN.

924
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
THESE ARE ALL GOOD PEOPLE.

925
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
THEY HAVE CHILDREN AND

926
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
GRANDCHILDREN, THEY ARE HURTING

927
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
TOO.

928
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
THEY ARE GRIEVING.

929
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
SO WE CAN'T VILLAINIZE, AND IF

930
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
YOU START VILLAINIZE, YOU WILL

931
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
PUSH THEM AWAY AND WE WON'T MOVE

932
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
FORWARD.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS A STALEMATE

933
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
AGAIN AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE

934
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
DESIRE.
>> DO YOU WORRY ABOUT POLITICAL

935
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
BACKLASH?
YOU SAID YOU'RE A PROUD MEMBER

936
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
OF THE NRA, AND AS YOU KNOW,

937
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
THEY OFTEN FUND CANDIDATES

938
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
WHO -- AND WORK TO OVERTHROW

939
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
FRANKLY CANDIDATES WHO DON'T

940
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
SUPPORT THE SAME KINDS OF

941
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
BELIEFS AND LEGISLATION THAT

942
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
THEY SUPPORT.

943
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
DO YOU WORRY ABOUT BACKLASH FROM

944
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
CONSTITUENTS?

945
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
>> I COME FROM THE BEAUTIFUL,

946
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
GREAT STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA,

947
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
THE MOST WONDERFUL PEOPLE AND WE

948
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
SIT DOWN AND WORK THROUGH OUR

949
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
PROBLEMS, WE HAVE CHALLENGES, WE

950
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
SIT DOWN.
COME TO A CONCLUSION WITH THE

951
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
FACTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

952
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
ASKING FOR.

953
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE I

954
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
GUESS MOVEMENT OR POLITICAL

955
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
BACKLASH ON ANYTHING AND

956
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
EVERYTHING.

957
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
THE EASIEST VOTE TO TAKE IN

958
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
WASHINGTON IS A NO VOTE.

959
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
VOTE FOR NOTHING.

960
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

961
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
BUT IF YOU ARE WILLING TO MOVE

962
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
FORWARD AND FOR THE SAKE OF OUR

963
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
CHILDREN, SOLEDAD, WE HAD 20

964
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
BEAUTIFUL BABIES SLAUGHTERED.

965
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
THAT CANNOT BE TOLERATED IN

966
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
AMERICA.
SO DOES THAT BRING US TO THE

967
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
TABLE?
HAVE WE HAD SUCH A TOXIC

968
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
ATMOSPHERE, POLITICAL TOXIC

969
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
ATMOSPHERE WE CAN'T SET AND HAVE

970
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
A MATURE, INTELLIGENT DECISION

971
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
AND LOOK AT THINGS AND MAKE SURE

972
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
WE CAN PROTECT THE SECOND

973
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION,

974
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
WHICH I WILL AS FERVENTLY AS

975
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
EVER.
I'M A PROUD MEMBER AND WILL

976
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
ALWAYS BE.
BUT WITH THAT, I'M A RESPONSIBLE

977
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
PARENT AND GRANDPARENT.

978
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
WE NEED TO LOOK.

979
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
HOW DO WE HANDLE MENTAL ILLNESS?

980
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
THIS ALL KNEES TO BE TALKED

981
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
ABOUT, IN A CULTURE OF VIOLENCE.

982
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
HOW HAVE WE GOTTEN WHERE WE ARE

983
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
TODAY?
WHEN YOU SAY THE BACKLASH, IT'S

984
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
A SHAME IN WASHINGTON, I HAVE

985
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
BEEN HERE TWO YEARS AS A U.S.

986
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
SENATOR.

987
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I HAVE SEEN ALMOST A GUILT BY

988
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
ASSOCIATION.
PEOPLE AFRAID TO TALK TO OTHER

989
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
PEOPLE TO GET A TRULY

990
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOG BECAUSE THEY

991
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
WERE AFRAID THEY WOULD BE

992
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
TAINTED OR TARGETED.

993
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
NOW IT'S ALMOST TO THE POINT

994
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
THAT WE'RE AFRAID TO HAVE AN

995
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
ADULT CONVERSATION.

996
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
SO GUILT BY CONVERSATION.

997
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
HAS IT GOTTEN TO THAT IN

998
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
WASHINGTON?

999
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I HOPE NOT.

1000
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
>> GOVERNOR PERRY SAID THIS

1001
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
ABOUT WEAPONS.

1002
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT FOR

1003
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
YOU.
>> IN THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITH

1004
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
OUR CONCEALED HANDGUN LICENSE IF

1005
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
YOU GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND

1006
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
YOU HAVE BEEN DULLY BACKGROUNDED

1007
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
AND TRAINED AND YOU ARE A

1008
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
CONCEALED HANDGUN LICENSED

1009
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
CARRYING INDIVIDUAL, YOU SHOULD

1010
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
BE ABLE TO CARRY YOUR HANDGUN

1011
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
ANYWHERE IN THIS STATE.

1012
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
>> DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

1013
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
HE IS TALKING ABOUT TEXAS, HIS

1014
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
STATE.

1015
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE ABLE

1016
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
TO CARRY A GUN ANYWHERE?

1017
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
>> SOLEDAD, HE'S TALKING ABOUT

1018
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
THE LAWS WE HAVE IN THIS

1019
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
COUNTRY.
THE LEGAL, LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS.

1020
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT TALKING

1021
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
ABOUT THAT.

1022
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
WE'RE TALKING CAN WE GET RICK

1023
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
PERRY TO SIT DOWN, A PROUD

1024
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
MEMBER OF THE NRA, CAN WE GET

1025
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
PEOPLE TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE AN

1026
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
ADULT CONVERSATION?

1027
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
THAT'S WHAT THIS REALLY IS

1028
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
ABOUT.

1029
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
IF WE CAN'T EVEN GET THEM TO THE

1030
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
TABLE, DO YOU REALLY THINK WE'LL

1031
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
HAVE SUCCESS IN BASICALLY HOW WE

1032
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
KEEP OUR CHILDREN SAFER?

1033
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
CHANGING THE VIOLENT CULTURE.

1034
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS --

1035
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
>> I'M SORRY.

1036
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT ASSAULT-TYPE

1037
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
WEAPONS, ESTIMATED TO BE

1038
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 2% TO 8%, SOME

1039
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
OF THE NUMBERS I'VE SEEN,

1040
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
INVOLVED IN GUN VIOLENCE.

1041
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
SO THAT LEAVES YOU, I THINK IT'S

1042
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
80% IS HANDGUNS INVOLVED IN GUN

1043
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
VIOLENCE.

1044
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
DOES THIS OPEN UP A CONVERSATION

1045
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
TO --

1046
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
>> I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE

1047
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
HOPEFULLY -- SOLEDAD, HOPEFULLY

1048
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
YOU WILL HAVE PROUD MEMBERS OF

1049
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
THE NRA AND DEFENDERS OF THE

1050
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
SECOND AMENDMENT WHO SAYS IT'S

1051
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
TIME TO HAVE AN INTELLIGENT

1052
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
CONVERSATION.
THE MILITARY ASSAULT RIFLES, IS

1053
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
THAT SOMETHING NEEDED IN OUR

1054
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
SOCIETY?
IT WAS DESIGNED FOR THE PURPOSE

1055
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
OF OUR MILITARY AND OUR FIRST

1056
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
RESPONDERS AND POLICE DEFENDING

1057
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
US AS A NATION.

1058
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
AND THOSE WHO ARE THE

1059
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
DISCUSSIONS WE SHOULD BE HAVING,

1060
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
ALONG WITH THE OTHER THINGS

1061
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
WE'VE BEEN TALKING.

1062
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH AND VIOLENT

1063
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
CULTURE.

1064
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING

1065
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT

1066
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
PHILOSOPHICAL BELIEFS TO COME

1067
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
OUT AND SIT DOWN.

1068
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
THEY ARE AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT,

1069
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
THINKING THAT ONE SIDE OR THE

1070
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
OTHER MIGHT ATTACK THEM.

1071
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
IT MIGHT BE POLITICALLY NOT

1072
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
POPULAR.

1073
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
AGAIN, I REMIND YOU, WE'RE

1074
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN HERE.

1075
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
NEVER IN MY LIFE DID I EVER

1076
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
THINK THAT I WOULD EVER SEE,

1077
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
SOLEDAD, CHILDREN SLAUGHTERED IN

1078
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
AMERICA.
I NEVER -- I CAN'T COMPREHEND

1079
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
IT.
I WAS WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN THIS

1080
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
PAST WEEKEND, I JUST CAN'T

1081
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
COMPREHEND IT.

1082
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
MY HEART GOES OUT.

1083
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I'M HURTING, I THINK ALL AMERICA

1084
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
IS HURTING RIGHT NOW.

1085
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000

01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
UPDATE THEM ON NEGOTIATIONS THAT

1631
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OF A

1632
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
DIFFICULT MEETING FOR HIM.

1633
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
LET'S GO TO WASHINGTON TO GET AN

1634
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
UPDATE ON THE TALKS.

1635
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
CNN'S DAN LOTHIAN IS THERE.

1636
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
>> Reporter: HELLO.

1637
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
YOU'RE RIGHT, THIS COULD BE A

1638
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
DIFFICULT MEETING FOR SPEAKER

1639
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
JOHN BOEHNER AS HE TRIES TO SELL

1640
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
THIS PROPOSAL TO HOUSE

1641
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
REPUBLICANS.

1642
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
THIS IS A DRAMATIC TURN OF

1643
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
EVENTS BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA

1644
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
AS YOU POINTED OUT HAD BEEN

1645
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
DIGGING IN HIS HEELS SAYING

1646
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
THERE COULD NOT BE A DEAL UNLESS

1647
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
TAXES WENT UP FOR HOUSE HOLDS

1648
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
MAKING MORE THAN $250,000 AND

1649
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,000
NOW THE PRESIDENT RAISING THAT

1650
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
TO 400,000 SO CERTAINLY SOME

1651
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
INDICATION AT LEAST ACCORDING TO

1652
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
HOUSE REPUBLICAN THIS IS IS

1653
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

1654
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
IN ADDITION THE PRESIDENT
CALLING FOR $1.2 TRILLION IN NEW

1655
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
REVENUE, ALSO $1.2 TRILLION IN

1656
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
SPENDING CUTS AND THIS MEETS THE

1657
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
DEMAND THAT SPEAKER BOEHNER HAD,

1658
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
THAT THERE HAD TO BE AN EQUAL

1659
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
AMOUNT OF SPENDING, AND ALSO

1660
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
REVENUE, BUT THEY STILL DON'T

1661
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
BELIEVE THAT THE MATH REALLY

1662
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
ADDS UP HERE.

1663
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
SPOKESMAN FOR SPEAKER BOEHNER'S

1664
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
OFFICE, BRENDAN BUCK SAYING A

1665
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
PROPOSAL THAT INCLUDES $1.3

1666
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
TRILLION IN REVENUE FOR ONLY

1667
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
$930 BILLION IN SPENDING CUTS

1668
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
CANNOT BE CONSIDERED BALANCED.

1669
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
SO WHILE THIS IS A MAJOR

1670
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
DEVELOPMENT HERE, STILL SOME

1671
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
DISAGREEMENTS.
THE WHITE HOUSE AT LEAST SOURCES

1672
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
POINTING OUT THE WHITE HOUSE

1673
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
SAYING THAT THIS IS NOT THE

1674
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
FINAL OFFER, SO SUGGESTING THERE

1675
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
COULD BE ADDITIONAL COMPROMISE

1676
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
AHEAD.
>> YOU SAW CRITICISM FROM THE

1677
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
RIGHT FROM BRENDAN BUCK, JUST

1678
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING.

1679
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA COULD FACE SOME

1680
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
HEAT FROM THE LEFT BECAUSE HE'S

1681
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
OFFERING CONCESSIONS THAT COULD

1682
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
RELATE TO SOME ENTITLEMENT CUTS

1683
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
WHEN YOU GET INTO THE COST OF

1684
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
LIVING INDEXES, CORRECT?

1685
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

1686
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
WHEN THE ARGUMENT FROM DEMOCRATS

1687
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
IN THE PRESIDENT'S PARTY ON THE

1688
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
LEFT HAS BEEN THAT THE PRESIDENT

1689
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
HAS BEEN TOO AGGRESSIVE WHEN IT

1690
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
COMES TO SPENDING CUTS SO

1691
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD ADD

1692
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
ADDITIONAL PRESSURE TO THE

1693
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
PRESIDENT'S SIDE IN THIS DEBATE,

1694
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
BUT AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT HAS

1695
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
MOVED.
HE'S TRYING TO REACH SOME KIND

1696
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
OF AGREEMENT HERE SO THEY CAN

1697
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
PREVENT THAT FISCAL CLIFF FROM

1698
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
HAPPENING, AS THAT CLOCK WINDS

1699
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
DOWN.
IT APPEARS THAT BOTH SIDES MUCH

1700
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
CLOSER TOGETHER NOW BUT STILL A

1701
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
LITTLE WAYS TO GO.

1702
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
>> DAN, TODAY A BIG DAY WHEN

1703
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER FACES THE

1704
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
REPUBLICAN CAUCUS OF THE HOUSE.

1705
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
DAN LOTHIAN IN WASHINGTON THANK

1706
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
YOU VERY MUCH.

1707
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
>>> HE WAS A WITNESS TO PEARL

1708
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
HARBOR, EARNED THE CONGRESSIONAL

1709
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
MEDAL OF HONOR, TRIBUTES POURING

1710
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
IN FOR DANIEL INOUYE.

1711
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
HE DIED YESTERDAY AT THE AGE OF

1712
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
88, THE SECOND LONGEST SERVING

1713
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
MEMBER EVER BEYOND THE LATE

1714
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
SENATOR ROBERT BYRD OF WEST

1715
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
VIRGINIA.

1716
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
FORMER VET BOB DOLAN SAID

1717
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
"SENATOR INOUYE WAS ONE OF THE

1718
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
SENATE'S GIANTS.
HE BELIEVED IN CIVILITY AND

1719
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
COMPROMISE WHEN NECESSARY AND HE

1720
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
WAS A GOOD, GOOD FRIEND."

1721
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
SENATOR DOLE AND INOUYE LONG

1722
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
BEFORE THEY WERE BOTH SENATORS

1723
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
WERE IN A MILITARY HOSPITAL FOR

1724
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
ALMOST TWO YEARS TOGETHER IN

1725
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
MICHIGAN WHILE THEY WERE BOTH

1726
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
RECOVERING FROM THEIR INJURIES

1727
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
FROM WORLD WAR II.

1728
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
TWO GREAT FRIENDS.

1729
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
SOLEDAD BACK TO YOU IN NEWTOWN.

1730
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
>> MY GOODNESS AND THE STORY OF

01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
WHAT HE DID, WHAT HAPPENED WHEN

1732
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
HE LOST HIS ARM AND HOW HE WAS

1733
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
ABLE TO SAVE HIMSELF IN WORLD

1734
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
WAR II, THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE

1735
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
STORY.
THANKS, JOHN, APPRECIATE IT.

1736
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
>>> THE HORROR OF NEWTOWN BRINGS

1737
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
TO MIND SO MANY OTHER SHOOTINGS,

1738
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON

1739
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
ARIZONA CONGRESSWOMAN GABBY GIVE

1740
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
FORDS, JANUARY 8th OF 2011 AND

1741
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
LEFT SIX PEOPLE DEAD.

1742
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
AMONG THOSE WOUNDED WAS RON

1743
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
BARBER, GIFFORDS DISTRICT

1744
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
DIRECTOR.

1745
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
HE TOOK DOWN WHEN SHE STEPPED

1746
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
DOWN.
HE WON A FULL TERM LAST MONTH.

1747
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
CONGRESSMAN BARBER THANK YOU FOR

1748
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
BEING WITH US.

1749
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
>> GOOD MORNING, THANK YOU FOR

1750
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
HAVING ME ON.

1751
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
>> IT'S MY PLEASURE.

1752
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT

1753
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
THIS TRAGEDY?

1754
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
IT'S NOT EVEN BEEN TWO YEARS

1755
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
SINCE THE SHOOTING THAT INJURED

1756
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
YOU AND INJURED GABBY GIFFORDS.

1757
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
DOES IT JUST TAKE YOU BACK TO

1758
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
THAT DAY TO ALMOST TWO YEARS

1759
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
AGO?
>> YES, IT DID, AND IT DID FOR

1760
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
MY WHOLE FAMILY, PARTICULARLY MY

1761
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
GRANDCHILDREN, WHO WERE AFFECTED

1762
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
THEN, AND I THINK EVEN MORE

1763
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED THIS TIME,

1764
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
KNOWING THAT CHILDREN THEIR AGE

1765
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
WERE KILLED IN NEWTOWN AND I

1766
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE

1767
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
COMMUNITY OF TUCSON IS JUST

1768
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
HEARTSICK OVER WHAT HAPPENED IN

1769
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
NOUN.
WE GATHERED TOGETHER ON SUNDAY

1770
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
NIGHT IN A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL TO

1771
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
PRAY FOR AND TO SEND OUR BEST

1772
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
WISHES TO THE PEOPLE OF NEWTOWN,

1773
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN, AS THEY

1774
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
WERE BACK IN JANUARY 8th, 2011.

1775
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
WE WANT THEM TO KNOW WE ARE WITH

1776
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
THEM AND WE UNDERSTAND PROBABLY

1777
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
BETTER THAN MOST COMMUNITIES

1778
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH.

1779
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
>> UNFORTUNATELY AND SADLY THAT

1780
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
IS PROBABLY TRUE.

1781
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
THE PRESIDENT ASKED HIS CABINET

1782
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
TO COME UP WITH SOME IDEAS ABOUT

1783
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
HOW THEY CAN CHANGE GUN LAWS.

1784
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
YOU'RE A SECOND AMENDMENT

1785
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
SUPPORTER.
WHAT KIND OF LAWS WOULD YOU

1786
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
DRAFT, IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY?

1787
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
>> I AM A SUPPORTER OF THE

1788
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
SECOND AMENDMENT.
I BELIEVE IT'S ONE OF THOSE

1789
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE TO PROTECT

1790
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
BUT I BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR US

1791
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
TO MOVE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION

1792
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
WITH REGARD TO ASSAULT WEAPONS,

1793
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
EXTENDED CLIPS, MAGAZINES WITH

1794
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
INCREDIBLE FIRE POWER.

1795
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
THE YOUNG MAN THAT SHOT THOSE OF

1796
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
US IN TUCSON LAST YEAR WAS

1797
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
CARRYING CLIPS THAT HAD 30

1798
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
ROUNDS IN THEM AND IN A MATTER

1799
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
OF ALMOST 45 SECONDS HE WAS ABLE

1800
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
TO UNLOAD ALL OF THOSE BULLETS

1801
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
AND SHOT 19 PEOPLE, SIX OF THEM

1802
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
DIED.
I DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN CONTINUE

1803
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
TO HAVE THOSE KINDS OF WEAPONS

1804
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
AVAILABLE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE

1805
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
HANDS OF SOMEONE WHO IS MENTALLY

1806
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
ILL AS HE WAS AND SEEMS LIKE ALL

1807
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
THE OTHER SHOOTERS IN THE LAST

1808
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
COUPLE YEARS HAVE HAD A

1809
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
DIAGNOSIS OF SERIOUS MENTAL

1810
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
ILLNESS.
I JUST WANT TO SAY I KNOW FROM

1811
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
MY EXPERIENCE IN WORKING IN THE

1812
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
FIELD OF MENTAL HEALTH FOR 32

1813
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
YEARS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE WITH

1814
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
MENTAL ILLNESS ARE VIOLENT

1815
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
PEOPLE BUT SOME ARE, ESPECIALLY

1816
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
IF THEY'RE NOT TREATED, SO WE

1817
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
HAVE TO DO BOTH.

1818
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
WE HAVE TO GO AFTER THE WEAPON

1819
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
POWER, THE FIREPOWER, AND WE

1820
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

1821
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
HAVE BETTER SERVICES FOR PEOPLE

1822
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND

1823
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:52,000
SUPPORTING THEIR FAMILIES.

1824
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
>> GOING TO THE ASSAULT WEAPONS,

1825
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
IS IT FAR ENOUGH OR SHOULD YOU

1826
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
BE FOCUSING WHEN IT COMES TO GUN

1827
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
LEGISLATION AND GUN CONTROL,

1828
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
SHOULD IT BE ON THE 30-ROUND

1829
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
CLIPS?

1830
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
SHOULD IT BE THE ASSAULT

1831
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
WEAPONS?
IF YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL GUN

1832
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
VIOLENCE, 80% IS CAUSED BY

1833
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
HANDGUNS OR ATTRIBUTED TO

1834
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
HANDGUN VIOLENCE SO IS THAT

1835
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
LEAVING OUT A MAJOR PORTION IN

1836
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
THE DEBATE, AND WHAT IS THE

1837
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
LEGISLATION THAT COULD ACTUALLY

1838
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
MAKE CHANGE AND WOULD AFFECT A

1839
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
LOT OF PEOPLE?

1840
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
>> I THINK FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE

1841
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT

1842
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
POSSIBLY CAN BE DONE.

1843
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I'VE HEARD OVER THE LAST FEW

1844
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
DAYS SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE HEAVILY

1845
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
SUPPORTED BY THE NRA COME OUT

1846
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
SAYING FINALLY WE HAVE TO DO

1847
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
SOMETHING AND WE'RE GOING TO

1848
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
LOOK AT LEGISLATION REGARDING

1849
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS, MILITARY STYLE

1850
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,000
WEAPONS AND EXTENDED CLIPS, AS I

1851
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
SAY, HAVE LOTS OF BULLETS IN

1852
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
THEM THAT CAN DO SERIOUS HARM IN

1853
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

1854
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
HANDGUN IS SOMETHING ELSE.

1855
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I THINK I'M AFTER A LEGISLATION,

1856
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I WANT TO SEE LEGISLATION

1857
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
ENACTED THAT TAKES AWAY THE

1858
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
AVAILABILITY OF THESE KINDS OF

1859
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
WEAPONS THAT CAN DO SO MUCH HARM

1860
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
AND SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

1861
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
IN TEN MINUTES, THE SHOOTING IN

1862
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
CONNECTICUT WAS COMPLETED, AND

1863
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
26 PEOPLE DIED, INCLUDING 20

1864
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
LITTLE ONES.

1865
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
FOR ME AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS,

1866
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
AS A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN THROUGH

1867
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
A SHOOTING TRAGEDY WHERE THIS

1868
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
EXTENDED CLIP ISSUE WAS PRESENT

1869
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
AND AS A GRANDFATHER I HAVE TO

1870
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
STAND UP AND BE COUNTED ON THIS.

1871
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE

1872
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
SURE WE LIMIT THE FIRE POWER AND

1873
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
GET SERVICES TO PEOPLE WITH

1874
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
MENTAL ILLNESS.

1875
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
WE HAVE TO DO BOTH.

1876
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
>> THOSE TWO THINGS ARE BOTH

1877
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
GIANT AND I THINK EVERYONE WOULD

1878
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
SAY THE MENTAL HEALTH PART OF IT

1879
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
IS COMPLETELY UNDERFUNDED.

1880
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE CHANGE

1881
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
AND DISCUSS THOSE THINGS

1882
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
TOGETHER, RIGHT?

1883
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
OFTEN I THINK GUN ADVOCATES WILL

1884
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
SAY WELL IT'S PEOPLE WHO HAVE

1885
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
MENTAL PROBLEMS WE SHOULD BE

1886
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
FOCUSING ON AND THERE ARE OTHERS

1887
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
WHO SAY LISTEN IT'S THE WEAPONS

1888
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
ON THE STREET WE SHOULD BE

1889
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
FOCUSING ON.
IS THERE A WAY TO TALK ABOUT

1890
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
BOTH AT THE SAME TIME AND MAKE

1891
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
TANGIBLE CHANGE?

1892
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
>> I THINK WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

1893
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MASS

1894
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
SHOOTINGS SINCE JANUARY 8th,

1895
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
THERE IS TWO ASPECTS OF THOSE

1896
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
SHOOTINGS THAT THEY ALL HAVE IN

1897
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
COMMON.
SOMEONE THE FIRE POWER, ASSAULT

1898
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
WEAPON, MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS

1899
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
AND EXTENDED CLIPS OF MAGAZINES

1900
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
THAT CARRY A LOT OF ROUNDS.

1901
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
THE OTHER IS UNTREATED AND IN

1902
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
SOME CASES UNDIAGNOSED SERIOUS

1903
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

1904
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
WE NEED TO GO AFTER BOTH OF

1905
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
THESE ISSUES AND WE NEED TO DO

1906
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
THEM IN TANDEM.

1907
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
ULTIMATELY I IMAGINE THEY'LL GET

1908
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
SEPARATED BUT FOR ME THEY GO

1909
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
HAND IN HAND AND WE HAVE TO DO

1910
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
BOTH.

01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
TO RECOVER.

2329
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
>> IT SOUNDS SO BRUTAL.

2330
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
YOU MENTIONED THE FIRST

2331
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
RESPONDERS, AND I REMEMBER

2332
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
SEEING WHEN THE PRESIDENT CAME

2333
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
TO THE INTERFAITH VIGIL, THE

2334
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
FIRST RESPONDERS EVERYONE CAME

2335
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
IN WALKED AND CHEERED AND PATTED

2336
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
THEM ON THE BACK.

2337
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
THEY'RE OFTEN FORGOTTEN IN THE

2338
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
STORY, PEOPLE REMEMBER THEM AS

2339
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
HEROES BUT WE DON'T THINK ABOUT

2340
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND HOW

2341
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
BRUTALLY DIFFICULT IT MUST HAVE

2342
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
BEEN FOR THEM TO GO INSIDE THAT

2343
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
SCHOOL AND SEE THE MASSACRE OF

2344
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
SMALL CHILDREN, MANY OF THOSE

2345
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
RESPONDERS, PARENTS THEMSELVES.

2346
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
>> THAT'S THE POINT BECAUSE

2347
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
RIGHT NOW I SAW THE UNIVERSITY

2348
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
OF CONNECTICUT PUTTING TOGETHER

2349
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
A SCHOLARSHIP FUND, SURELY THERE

2350
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
ARE PRIVATE CHECKS ARRIVING,

2351
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
PRIVATE TRANSMISSIONS OR

2352
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
TRANSFERS OF MONEY.

2353
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT A

2354
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
COMMUNITY FOUNDATION OR PERHAPS

2355
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,000
THE UNITED WAY INITIALLY PUT

2356
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
TOGETHER A PLAN FOR HOW DO WE

2357
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS.

2358
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
SOME PEOPLE NEED LONG-TERM

2359
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
COUNSELING.
THE FIRST RESPONDERS

2360
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
PARTICULARLY PEOPLE NEED TO BE

2361
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
SENSITIVE TO THOSE ABSOLUTELY

2362
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
STUNNING, SEARING, SHOCKING,

2363
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
UNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS OF THOSE

2364
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
WONDERFUL LITTLE CHILDREN SO

2365
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
PEOPLE NEED TO SIT AROUND THE

2366
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
TABLE TOGETHER, WORK IT OUT, BUT

2367
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
REALIZE THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN

2368
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
THIS BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME,

2369
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
UNFORTUNATELY, TRAGICALLY THEY

2370
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
HAVE TO WORK THROUGH IT FOR A

2371
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
LONG TIME.

2372
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
>> SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS

2373
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
NEXT?
ALL MORNING WE'VE BEEN REPORTING

2374
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
ABOUT THE NEW FOCUS ON GUN

2375
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
CONTROL, THERE IS A SUPPORT IF

2376
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS MUCH

2377
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,000
HIGHER, 14 POINTS HIGHERS BEFORE

2378
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
THIS MASSACRE.

2379
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS IN

2380
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
THAT CONVERSATION ON GUN

2381
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
CONTROL?
WHAT CHANGE DO YOU THINK SHOULD

2382
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
HAPPEN?
>> WELL I'M A HUNTER.

2383
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I'VE BEEN A HUNTER MY WHOLE

2384
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
LIFE.
I HAD MY FIRST SHOTGUN WHEN I

2385
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
WAS 11, MY FIRST JOB WAS IN A

2386
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
SKEET FIELD.
I THINK THIS DEBATE, THIS

2387
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
CONVERSATION NEEDS TO TAKE

2388
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
PLACE.
SHOULD PEOPLE BE ABLE TO ACCESS

2389
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
TO PURCHASE SEMIAUTOMATIC

2390
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
WEAPONS WITH THESE CLIPS, THESE

2391
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
MAGAZINES THAT PROVIDE FOR

2392
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
BASICALLY UNLIMITED FIRE POWER?

2393
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
THAT NEEDS TO BE DEBATED AND

2394
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
DISCUSSED.
WE DID IT ONCE.

2395
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I THINK WE SHOULD DO IT AGAIN TO

2396
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
BAN THOSE ASSAULT WEAPONS, BUT

2397
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
ALSO YOU HAVE TO DISCUSS MENTAL

2398
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
HEALTH, PRIVACY ISSUES, YOU HAVE

2399
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
TO DISCUSS QUITE TRUTHFULLY THE

2400
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,000
EASY DIVORCE PROCESS, EVEN WITH

2401
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
CHILDREN, MARRIAGES ARE -- MORE

2402
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,000
THAN 60% END IN DIVORCE.

2403
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
VIDEO VIOLENCE, MOVIE VIOLENCE,

2404
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
TELEVISION VIOLENCE, ALL OF THIS

2405
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE, ROUND

2406
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
TABLE COMMUNITY RESOLUTION,

2407
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
NATIONAL RESOLUTION SO WE CAN

2408
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
MAKE SURE THIS IS AN ABERRATION

2409
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
BUT AS A CHILD WE HAD CAP GUNS,

2410
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
WE WENT HUNTING AFTER SCHOOL BUT

2411
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,000
NONE OF US SLEIGHTERED O EE EEE

2412
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
SLAUGHTERED OUR CLASSMATES.
THERE'S SOMETHING EVIL IN THE

2413
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
HEARTS AND MINDS OF SOME PEOPLE.

2414
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
THAT ALL NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

2415
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
>> THERE'S A STATE REP. IN YOUR

2416
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
STATE, MARK McCULLOUGH, AND HE

2417
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
WILL INTRODUCE A BILL WHICH

2418
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
WOULD ALLOW CERTIFIED TEACHERS

2419
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
AND PRINCIPALS TO CARRY GUNS IN

2420
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
THE SCHOOL.

2421
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
HERE'S WHAT HE WROTE, "WE CANNOT

2422
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
CONTINUE TO BE SHACKLED BY

2423
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
POLITICALLY RECORRECT,

2424
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
REFLEXIVE, ANTI-GUN SENTIMENT IN

2425
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
THE FACE OF THE OBVIOUS.

2426
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
OUR SCHOOLS ARE SOFT TARGETS.

2427
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
IT'S INCREDIBLY IRRESPONSIBLE TO

2428
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
LEAVE OUR SCHOOLS UNDEFENDED TO

2429
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
ALLOW MADMEN TO KILL DOZENS OF

2430
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
INNOCENTS WHEN WE HAVE A VERY

2431
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
SIMPLE AVAILABLE TO US TO

2432
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
PREVENT IT AND BY THAT SOLUTION

2433
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
HE MEANS ARMING SOME OF THE

2434
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
TEACHERS AND THE PRINCIPALS.

2435
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
DO YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA

2436
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
IN YOUR STATE, WHICH IS WHERE

2437
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
HE'S PROPOSING IT IN.

2438
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
>> SOLEDAD I WAS THE ARCHITECT

2439
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
REALLY OF THE FIRST CONCEALED

2440
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:58,000
CARRY LAW IN THE UNITED STATES

2441
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
BUT WE REQUIRED A MENTAL HEALTH

2442
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
HISTORY, CRIMINAL BACKGROUND

2443
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
INVESTIGATION AND A 15-WEEK

2444
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
COURSE BEFORE SOMEBODY COULD

2445
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,000
HAVE A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT.

2446
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
THAT'S AN EXAMPLE WHERE PERHAPS

2447
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
A FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSON,

2448
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
EVEN A TEACHER WHO HAPPENS TO

2449
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
HAVE A CONCEAL CARRY PERMIT IN

2450
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
MY STATE COULD SATISFY THE NEEDS

2451
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
OF SECURITY IN THAT SCHOOL.

2452
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
I WOULD HOPE WE WOULD ATTACK THE

2453
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
WHOLE UNIVERSE OF PROBLEMS AND

2454
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
VIOLENT VIDEOS, VIOLENT MOVIES,

2455
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
INSENSITIVITY AND DESENSITIVITY

2456
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
TOWARD THE PRECIOUS LIFE RIGHTS

2457
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
OF EVERY HUMAN BEING, THOSE ARE

2458
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED

2459
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
AS WELL, WHETHER OKLAHOMA PASSES

2460
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
THIS BILL OR NOT IS OKLAHOMA'S

2461
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
BUSINESS BUT THE CONCEAL CARRY

2462
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
LAW WAS PRUDENTLY HANDLED AND

2463
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
OUR VIOLENT CRIME RATE HAS GONE

2464
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
DOWN.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING

2465
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
IN NEW YORK CITY NOT LONG AGO WE

2466
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
HAD A DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE WHO

2467
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
SHOT A CO-WORKER AND THEN IT

2468
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
HAPPENED NOT VERY FAR FROM WHERE

2469
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
I LIVE AND WHEN THE POLICE

2470
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
OPENED FIRE IT TURNED OUT THAT

2471
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
EIGHT OTHER PEOPLE WERE INJURED

2472
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
IN THE CROSS-FIRE FRANKLY AND

2473
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
SOME OF THE FRAGMENTS AND THINGS

2474
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
LIKE THAT.

2475
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
WHEN YOU TALK TO POLICE OFFICERS

2476
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
THE IDEA OF HAVING PEOPLE ARMED

2477
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
ESPECIALLY INSIDE OF A SCHOOL IS

2478
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
MORE CONCERNING TO THEM THAN

2479
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
FEELING THAT IT WOULD HELP THEM

2480
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
IN WHAT THEY DO.

2481
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
NOT EVERYBODY, BUT A LOT.

2482
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
>> I THINK SOLEDAD, QUITE

2483
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
TRUTHFULLY, IT WOULD DEPEND,

2484
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
VERSUS URBAN, BIG CITY VERSUS

2485
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
SMALL TOWNS.

2486
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
IN THE CASE OF THE NEW YORK

2487
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
INCIDENT, AS AN EX-FBI AGENT I

2488
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
THOUGHT IT LOOKS TO ME THESE

2489
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
GUYS WERE TRIGGER HAPPY.

2490
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
YOU HAD A LOT OF SHOOTING GOING

2491
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
ON WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND

2492
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:51,000
WHICH WAS NOT HANDLED WELL.

2493
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
>> THAT IS AN INTERESTING POINT

2494
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
BECAUSE THEY'RE TRAINED, RIGHT?

2495
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
TO BE A POLICE OFFICER IN THE

2496
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
CITY OF NEW YORK REQUIRES SUCH

2497
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
INCREDIBLE TRAINING ON WEAPONS I

2498
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
GUESS I'D WORRY PEOPLE WHO ARE

2499
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
NOT TRAINED LIKE THEY ARE YOU

2500
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
KNOW AND WE SEE SO MANY PEOPLE

2501
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
INJURED OUT OF THAT INCIDENT, I

2502
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
GUESS I EXTRAPOLATE OUT OF THAT,

2503
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
THAT'S VERY WORRISOME.

2504
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
>> THAT'S WHY CONCEAL CARRY OR

2505
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
OPEN CARRY LAW IN ANY STATE

2506
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
NEEDS TO HAVE NOT ONLY MENTAL

2507

HEALTH HISTORY AND CRIMINAL

2508
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
BACKGROUND BUT ALSO EXTENSIVE

2509

TRAINING TO AVOID THE SITUATION

2510
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000

>> LET ME ASK YOU A LAST FINAL

2514
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
QUESTION, THE PEOPLE IN OKLAHOMA

2515
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
CITY I KNOW DID NOT WANT TO BE

2516
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
DEFINED PI A TRAGEDY AND WE

2517
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
HEARD FROM PEOPLE THE SAME THING

2518
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
IN NEWTOWN, NOBODY WANTS TO BE

2519
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
DEFINED BY THE WORST THING THAT

2520
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
EVER HAPPENS IN THEIR COMMUNITY.

2521
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
DO YOU THINK THAT OKLAHOMA CITY

2522
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
HAS AVOIDED THAT?

2523
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
DO YOU THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE FOR

2524
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
NEWTOWN?
>> WELL INITIALLY THAT WAS

2525
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
EXAMINE KTLY HOW OKLAHOMA CITY

2526
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
WAS DESCRIBED BUT THERE WAS A

2527
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
RENAISSANCE MOMENT, OR

2528
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
RENAISSANCE YEARS AGO.
THE FACT THAT OKLAHOMA CITY

2529
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
SHOWED ITSELF TO BE SO CARING

2530
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
SEEN SHARING, PUTTING TOGETHER

2531
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:15,000
THESE FUNDS TO PUT EVERY CHILD,

2532
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
170 CHILDREN LOST ONE PARENT.

2533
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
EVERY CHILD WHO WANTED TO GO TO

2534
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
COLLEGE WENT TO COLLEGE.

2535
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
THE FACT THERE WAS NO LOOTING

2536
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
AND OVER 300 BUILDINGS DAMAGED

2537
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
OR DESTROYED, OKLAHOMA CITY WAS

2538
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,000
PROUD OF THE WAY TO THE WAY THEY

2539
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
RESPONDED TO THE EVIL TRAGEDY,

2540
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:37,000
FROM THE OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER

2541

FRANCHISE TO ALL SORTS OF

REDEVELOPMENT.

2543
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
IT'S THE SENSE OF PRIDE.

2544
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I'M NOT SAYING ALWAYS GOOD

2545
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
THINGS COME FROM BAD THINGS.

2546
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
SOMETIMES GOOD FROM EVIL AND IN

2547
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
OKLAHOMA CITY'S CASE THE

2548
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,000
COMMUNITY FELT BETTER ABOUT

2549
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
THEMSELVES.
THEY'LL NEVER BLING BACK THE

2550
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT

2551
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
HAVE BEEN INJURED OR KILLED.

2552
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000

2553
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000

A DEAL LATE OUT IN PART.

2585
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE WHERE THE

01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000

SAID NO, WE WANT TO TAKE THIS

2611
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:30,000
OFF THE TABLE.
DOUGH WE DON'T WANT ANOTHER

THIS.

2620
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
SO FAR THE SPEAKER HAS BEEN ABLE

2621
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,000
TO KEEP HIS FOLKS IN LINE

2622
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:50,000
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN AGGRAVATED

2623
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
THE PRESIDENT'S NOT GIVEN.

2624
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
WE'LL SEE IF HE STILL HAS ALL OF

2625
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
HIS TLOOPZ BEHIND HIM.

2626
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,000
>> THE $250,000 NUMBER FOR TAXES

2627
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
HAS BEEN PART OF PRESIDENT OWE

2628
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
PA MA'S RHETORIC SINCE HE

2629
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
CAMPAIGNED IN IT007.

2630
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
THE SPEAKER DOES GO INTO THAT

2631
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:10,000
MEETING WITH REPUBLICANS WITH

2632
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
MAYBE AN ARGUMENT THAT HE HAS

2633
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
GOTTEN THE PRESIDENT TO MOVE.

2634
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
>> HE SURE DOES BUT FOR

2635
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
REPUBLICANS, FOR THEM TO

2636
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000

2641
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
IT LOOKS LIKE $930 BILLION IN

2642
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
SPENDING CUTS AND A DISCREPANCY

2643

01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN

2685
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, CAN SHAKE

2686
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,000
THE FAITH OF THE FIRMEST

2687
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,000
BELIEVER.

2688
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
T.D. JAKES HAS A CONGREGATION OF

2689
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
30,000 MEMBERS.

2690
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> I WAS READING THE EULOGY THAT

2691
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
THE MOTHER OF 6-YEAR-OLD NOAH

2692
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
POZNER WROTE AND SHE DELIVERED

2693
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
IT AT HIS FUNERAL YESTERDAY AND

2694
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
IT JUST BROKE MY HEART AND I

2695
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,000
THINK HOW DO YOU COUNSEL PARENTS

2696
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,000
WHO HAVE TO DELIVER EULOGIES FOR

2697
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
A 6-YEAR-OLD OR 7-YEAR-OLD?

2698
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
WHAT WORDS DO YOU POSSIBLY USE?

2699
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO THINK WE

2700
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
HAVE TO REMEMBER ABOUT GREECE

2701
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
THEY ARE NOT A MONOLITHING

2702
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
SOCIETY.
FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE

2703
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO UTTER A

2704
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,000
WORD OR A SOUND.

2705
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
FOR OTHER PEOPLE IT'S CATHARTIC

2706
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
TO OPEN UP AND EXPRESS THEIR

2707
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
LOVE AND DEVOTION AND TO HAVE

2708
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
THE FINAL WORDS OVER SOMEONE

2709
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
THEY LOVE.

2710
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I TRY VERY MUCH AS A PASTOR NOT

2711
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,000
TO AMONG THEIR RELATIONSHIPS AND

2712
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,000
EMOTIONS AND HOW THEY USE TO

2713
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
COMMEMORATE THE PERSON THEY

2714
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
LEAPLY WILL HAVE.

2715
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
>> AS A REPORTER I LIKE TO GET

2716
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,000
AS MANY INFORMATION AS YOU CAN.

2717
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
I WANT TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL

2718
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
ABOUT EVERYTHING AND THAT'S A

2719
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:33,000
WAY OF PROCESSING IT, MANAGING

2720
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,000
IT.
PEOPLE MUST ASK YOU QUESTIONS

2721
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
YOU CANNOT ANSWER.

2722
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,000
AND THEY SAY WHERE WAS GOD WHEN

2723
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:46,000
THIS HAPPENED?
>> IT'S PRECISELY AS YOU IS

2724
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,000
ASAID I'VE TRIED TO AVOID

2725
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
ANSWERS GOESABLE TEMPORARY.

2726
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE

2727
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
HANDEDS NOW LIFE THAT WE DO NOT

2728
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,000
KNOW OR UNDERSTAND.

2729
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:05,000
THESE AREAS, AMBIGUOUS AREAS

2730
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A DEFICIT

2731
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,000
ANSWER IT'S BETTER NOT TO GIVE

2732
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
ANY ANSWER AT ALL THAN TO GIVE

2733
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
ONE INAPPROPRIATE.

2734
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE FAITH FOR

2735
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,000
THOSE THINGS WE CANNOT EXPLAIN

2736
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,000
AND POINT TO DIRECTLY, WE HAVE

2737
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
TO FRTRUST GOD AND LEAN ON HIM

2738
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
GET THROUGH THE SUFFICIENT TIMES

2739
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,000
IN LIFE.

2740
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:31,000
>> THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL

2741
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
EMILIES WHO FATHER CAME OUT TO

2742
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,000
REPORTERS.

2743
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
HE SAID I'M NOT ANGRY.

2744
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
WE'VE BIN AND TALKED ABOUT

2745
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
FORGIVENESS IT'S FOR YOURSELF

2746
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
NOT FOR THE OTHER PERSON IN A

2747
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,000
LOT OF WAYS.

2748
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,000
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE EVER

2749
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:48,000
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THAT

2750
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,000
NOT JUST HERE IN THIS MASSACRE?

2751
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING

2752
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
HONESTLY.
>> WELL I THINK DIFFERENT PEOPLE

2753
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
AGAIN RESPOND DIFFERENTLY BUT

2754
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO

2755
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:04,000
KEEP IN NIND IS THAT WE DON'T

2756
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THE TRAITOR

2757
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:11,000
YET.
AS YOU UNFOENL THAT MYSTERY THAT

2758
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
ARE NOT ON MEDICATION BUT THEY

2759
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
HAVE PROBLEMS IN THEIR LIVES,

2760
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
THAT I EMOTIONAL CAPACITIES AND

2761
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
REASONINGS, SOMETIMES UNDER

2762
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
EX-TEN SITUATING SERVICES PEOPLE

2763
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
ARE ABLE TO FORGIVE AND OTHERS

2764
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
NOT SO READILY.

2765
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
TODAY IS NOT THE DAY TO EMBARK

2766
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
UPON A HUGE MISSION.

2767
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
TODAY IS THE WAY TO HONOR THE

2768
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
VICTIMS SLAIN TO PROCESS, TO

2769
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
COMMEMORATE THEM, TO TAKE OUT

2770
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
PICTURES TO HUG, HOLD HANDS,

2771
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
BRING AROUND THE PEOPLE YOU FEEL

2772
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
SECURE WITH AND REAFFIRM YOUR

2773
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
CIRCLE OF LOVE BECAUSE IF WE DO

2774
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,000
THAT AS A SOCIETY FROM THAT

2775
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
PLACE OF EMOTIONAL STABILITY,

2776
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
THEN WE CAN EMBARK ON THEARD USE

2777
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
TASK OF SORTING OUT HOW WE

2778
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
REALLY FEEL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

2779
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
AND THEN PLANNING A NEW WHAT I

2780
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,000
CALL A NEW NORMAL BECAUSE THE

2781
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
ONLY NORMAL IS GONE.

2782
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET

2783
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
THAT BACK AGAIN AND IT'S VERY

2784
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
IMPORTANT YOU REDEKIND THE NEW

2785
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
NORMAL, NEW TRADITIONS IN THE

2786
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
FAMILY, NO WAYS OF EXPRESSING

2787
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,000
THE FAMILY AND THAT IS A HUGE

2788
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
TASK YOU SPEND MANY, MANY YEARS

2789
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
TRYING TO DO.

2790
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000

Mmm

Unlocking the world's potential.

>>> BISHOP JAKES, I HAVE TIME

2807
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
FOR ONE LAST QUESTION AS WE TALK

2808
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:33,000
ABOUT NEWTOWN, REMEMBERING.

2809
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
YOUR CHURCH DOES A LOT OF

2810
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,000
OUTREACH INTO THE COMMUNITY AND

2811
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,000
SOMETIMES I THINK AS AMERICANS

2812
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,000
WE'RE CONFLICTED ABOUT MENTAL

2813
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,000
HEALTH.
WE THINK PEOPLE DEFINITELY

2814
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
SHOULD BE GETTING TREATMENT.

2815
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
WE DON'T NECESSARILY VOTE TO PAY

2816
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,000
FOR IT.
WE TURN AWAY FROM PEOPLE I THINK

2817
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
WHO OFTEN HAVE MENTAL HEALTH

2818
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
ISSUES BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO

2819
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
GET IN PEOPLE'S BUSINESS.

2820
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING FOR NOT

2821
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
IN THIS CASE, WE DON'T KNOW

2822
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
ENOUGH ABOUT THE SHOOTER BUT IN

2823
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
GENERAL WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE

2824
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
PEOPLE TO BE DOING FOR THEIR

2825
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
FELLOW BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

2826

QUESTION.

2828
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE PRESS

ON CONGRESS TO PROVIDE RESOURCES

2830
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
SO PEOPLE WHO NEED MENTAL HEALTH

CAN GET THE APPROPRIATE

2832
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
TREATMENT THAT WE NEED.

2833
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
I CAUTION PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T

2834
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,000
HAVE TO HAVE A FRE EXISTING
