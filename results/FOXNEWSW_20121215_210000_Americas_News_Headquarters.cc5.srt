00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
THEY WENT TO SANDY HOOD GRADE

191
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
SCHOOL WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG AND

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
THEY WERE IN COLLEGE AND

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
FINISHED FINALS.

194
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I RAN TO MY FRIENDS THAT WERE

195
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
HELPING ME.

196
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
AND START PRAYING THERE HAS BEEN

197
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
A SHOOTING.

198
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
THEY STARTED LOCKING DOWN THE

199
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
DOORS AND BITS AND PIECES KEPT

200
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
COMING THROUGH.

201
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS

202
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
HAPPENING.

203
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
MAYBE THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS A

204
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
SECOND SHOOTER, THAT IS WHY THEY

205
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
WENT INTO LOCK DOWN.

206
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
WHAT HE WOULD BE DEALING WITH.

207
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
ONE OF THE GUYS CAME OUT, I JUST

208
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
CALLED AND HAD THE FAMILY LOCK

209
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
MY DOORS.

210
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I CALLED MY FAMILY, LOCK YOUR

211
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
DOORS.

212
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THEY WERE SEARCHING OUR

213
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
NEIGHBORHOOD IN CASE THERE WAS

214
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
SOMEBODY WHO HAD COME BACK OVER

215
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
THIS WAY.

216
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
>> Gregg: SINCE YOUR SON WENT TO

>> THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AT SANDY

220
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
HOOK FOR EIGHT YEARS, BUT IN THE

221
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
EIGHT YEARS MY KIDS WENT THERE,

222
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I VOLUNTEERED THERE A LOT.

223
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I WAS THERE ALMOST DAILY HELPING

224
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000

I MY MANY OF THE STAFF THAT ARE

STILL THERE AND TEACHERS.

229
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
IT WAS VERY NICE ENVIRONMENT.

230
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
NICE SCHOOL, EVERYBODY KNEW

231
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
EVERYBODY.
WE ALL LOOKED OUT FOR EVERYBODY.

232
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO SEE WHAT

233
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
HAS HAPPENED THERE.

QUIET COMMUNITY OF NEWTOWN WHERE

JUST ABOUT EVERYONE KNOWS

HERE IS MORE FROM FRIENDS AND

>> PARENTS' WORST NIGHTMARE

245
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
SAYING YOUR CHILD IS NOT COMING

246
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
HOME.

247
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
WHEN THEY FIRST CAME HOME FROM

248
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
SCHOOL, GIVE THEM THE BIGGEST

249
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
HUG I COULD.

250
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'M GRATEFUL THAT SHE IS HERE.

251
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THE

252
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000

>> WHEN WE WERE AT SCHOOL, WE

253
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
WERE TOLD SANDY HOOK SCHOOL AND

254
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
WE HAD TO GO TO LOCKDOWN.

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I HAVE MANY FRIENDS THERE.

258
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I WAS TERRIFIED BECAUSE I DIDN'T

259
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

260
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
THEY SAID AN INCIDENT AND AN

261
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
EMERGENCY SITUATION.

262
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000

268
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
DOWN DECORATIONS, TELLING

269
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
REPORTERS THEY FEEL GUILTY ABOUT

270
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
CELEBRATING THE HOLIDAY.

271
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE.

272
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
>> Gregg: OUT OF THIS TRAGEDY,

273
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000

279
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
MOMENT THEY HEARD THE FIRST

280
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
SHOTS.

281
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
MANY OF THEM LOCKING CLASSROOM

282
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000

THE HALLWAY STRAIGHT FOR THE

294
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000

THAT MOVE ENDED UP COSTING HER

295
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
HER LIFE.

296
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
THE LIBRARY CLERK SAYS THEY

297
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
WOULD NOT OPEN UP THE DOORS

298
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
UNTIL THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY SURE

299
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
IT WAS SAFE.

300
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
>> WE DIDN'T KNOW, WE WOULDN'T

301
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
LET THEM IN AT FIRST.

302
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
THEY HAD SOMEONE CALL US AND PUT

303
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
A BADGE UNDER THE DOOR AND THAT

304
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
IS WHEN WE MOVED THE FILE

305
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
CABINETS AND LET THE KIDS OUT.

306
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000

INSTEAD HE FORCED HIS WAY IN.

314
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
MOMENTS LATER HE OPENED FIRE AND

315
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
POLICE PUT OUT THIS DISPATCH

316
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000

331
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I WANT TO BEGAN WITH THE SCHOOL

332
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
SECURITY THERE AT SANDY HOOK.

333
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
THE PRINCIPAL APPARENTLY HAVING

334
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
INITIATED HERSELF ADDITIONAL

335
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
SECURITY MEASURES AT THE SCENE.

336
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
HOW MIGHT THIS INCIDENT CHANGE

337
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
ON A NATIONAL LEVEL THE WAY THAT

338
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
SCHOOL SAFETY SHOULD BE

339
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
IMPLEMENTED?

340
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
>> IT IS VERY TRAGIC THAT

341
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
INCIDENTS LIKE THIS MUCH LIKE

342
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
EVERY OTHER SECURITY INCIDENT

343
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
MOVES TOWARD A CONTINUUM WHERE

344
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
PEOPLE ARE THINKING A LITTLE

345
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
DIFFERENT ABOUT SECURITY.

346
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
IT SOUNDED TO ME THAT THE SCHOOL

347
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
HAD PUT A BUZZER SYSTEM AND

348
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
LOCKED DOWN THE DOOR, IT SOUNDS

349
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
PRUDENT.

350
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
NOW, WE KNOW OR BELIEVE THIS

351
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
PERPETRATOR BROKE THROUGH THE

352
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
GLASS AND MADE HIS WAY IN.

353
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
THE WHOLE IDEA OF SECURITY IS

354
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
JUST PROVIDE SOME DELAY.

355
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
ANY PERSON INTENT ON GETTING

356
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
INTO A FACILITY WILL GET THERE.

357
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
WE WANTED TO DELAY THAT ACTIVITY

358
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
TO GIVE MORE TIME FOR POLICE TO

359
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
ARRIVE.
I THINK WHAT THEY DID UP IN THAT

360
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
SCHOOL WAS VERY PRUDENT FOR

361
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
CONDITIONS.

362
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
IT OPENS UP A NATIONAL DIALOGUE

363
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
TOWARDS HOW WE SHOULD BE LOOKING

364
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
AT SCHOOLS NO MATTER WHERE THEY

365
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
ARE.

366
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
COLUMBINE WAS ONE INDICATION OF

367
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
THINGS THAT SCHOOLS NEED TO BE

368
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
LOOKING AT.
I THINK AFTER THIS, THEY WILL BE

369
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
LOOKED AT IN MORE BROAD FASHION.

370
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
>> WHAT IT TELLS ME, THEY TRIED

371
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
TO DO EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO

372
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
STOP SOMETHING LIKE THIS FROM

373
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
HAPPENING.
CAN WE EVER DO ENOUGH?

374
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
>> WE ALL WOULD LIKE TO DO

375
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
ENOUGH AND SAVE EVERY LIFE THERE

376
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
IS.

DIFFICULTY IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS.

562
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
HE WAS DEVOID OF FRIENDS.

563
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
GIVEN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, DO

564
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
YOU SEE A CONNECTION HERE?

565
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
>> YOU ALWAYS SEE A CONNECTION

566
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
THERE.
IT GETS MORE CONFUSING BECAUSE

567
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
YOU ALSO HEAR OTHER REPORTS OF

568
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
PEOPLE THAT DESCRIBE HIM AS A

569
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
MEMBER OF THE CLASS, THE

570
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
COMMUNITY AND YOU SEE BOTH.

571
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
IN MANY TIMES BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

572
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
INTEGRATED ON THE OUTSIDE INTO

573
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
COMMUNITIES AND CLUBS AND

574
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
CIRCLES OF FRIENDS, THE

575
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
ASSUMPTION IS MADE THAT THEY ARE

576
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
MORE INTEGRATED AND CONNECTED ON

577
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
THE INSIDE THAN THEY REALLY ARE.

578
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
WHAT HAPPENS IS A LOT OF TIMES

579
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
THEY HAVE A SECRET, DARK IN PAIN

580
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
AND CONFUSED OR MENTALLY ILL

581
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
SIDE OF THEM THAT NOBODY

582
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
CONSISTENTLY GETTING CLOSE TO TO

583
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE.

584
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
THAT IS WHY, FOR EXAMPLE, AS A

585
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL, WHEN

586
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
WE'RE UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH

587
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING

588
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
THROUGH THINGS, THEY MAKE

589
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
SPECIFIC STATEMENTS OR THREATS.

590
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
WE KNOW ENOUGH WE CAN MAKE THE

591
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
CALL AND HAVE THEM ARRESTED.

592
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
MANY TIMES PEOPLE DON'T HAVE

593
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
ANYBODY THAT CLOSE THAT IS

594
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
HEARING THIS STUFF.

595
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
>> Gregg: THEY EXAMINED 37

596
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
DEADLY INCIDENTS INVOLVING 41

597
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
PERPETRATORS, ONLY 17% HAD A

598
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
PRIOR MENTAL ILLNESS DIAGNOSIS.

599
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
SO THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A

600
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
STRONG CORRELATION THERE.

601
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
HAVING SAID THAT THE BROTHER OF

602
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
THE KILLER SAID THAT HIS BROTHER

603
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
WAS AUTISTIC AND MADE HAVE HAD

604
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
ASPERGER'S.

605
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
THERE IS A BIG GAP BETWEEN A

606
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
PRIOR DIAGNOSIS AND PEOPLE THAT

607
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
ARE STRUGGLING AND

608
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
UNDIAGNOSISED, AS WELL.

609
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
THE BIG POINTED WHEN THERE ARE

610
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND COMMUNITY

611
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
MEMBERS THAT YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST

612
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
NOT OKAY THAT THEY ARE

613
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
DISCONNECTED IN SOME WAY OR

614
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
WITHDRAWN OR HURT.

615
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
WE ALWAYS HAVE TO PULL THEM IN

616
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
AND DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN.

617
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
>> Gregg: PARENTS ARE SOMETIMES

618
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
IN DENIAL ABOUT THINGS LIKE

619
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
THAT?

620
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
>> YEAH, I'M A PARENT.

621
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'VE GOT TWO GIRLS.

622
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
THE NORMAL TEEN OR PRE-TEEN

623
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
SCENARIO IS YOU ARE ALWAYS

624
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
TRYING TO BRIDGE CONNECTIONS

625
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO HAVE

626
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
THE PARTS THEY KEEP AWAY FROM

627
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
PARENTS.

628
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
IT'S WHY WE HAVE STATISTICS,

629
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
EVEN ONE OR TWO FAMILY DINNERS A

630
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
WEEK WE KNOW IS CORE RELATED

631
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
WITH A LOT OF BAD STUFF SO

632
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
PARENTS KNOW WAS THE KIDS ARE

633
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
THINKING.

634
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
NOWHERE THEIR HURTS ARE AND

635
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
WHERE THEY FEEL SLEIGHTED BY

636
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
OTHER KIDS.

637
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
WE HAVE TO STAY CLOSE TO THEIR

638
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
LITTLE HEART, WE FORGET AND

639
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
STILL BE CONFUSED OR WOUNDED.

640
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
>> Gregg: IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS

641
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
HAPPENING SO MUCH.

642
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
EVEN THE PRESIDENT POINTED THAT

643
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
OUT, AND YET THERE IS A STUDY

644
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
OUT THAT POINTS OUT IT'S

645
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
ACTUALLY ON THE DECLINE, THESE

MASS MURDER INCIDENTS IN

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
SHOPPING MALLS AND SCHOOLS.

648
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
THE BOTTOM LINE THERE ARE TENS

OF THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLS IN

650
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000

651
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000

653
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
>> YEAH, I READ ONE REPORT ON

654

THE INTERNET ABOUT HOW PEOPLE

655
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
ARE EXPLAINING IT TO PARENTS.

656
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
IT'S SO RARE.

657
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
IF YOU GET THE REAL STATISTIC OF

658
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
HOW MANY CHILDREN TO GO SCHOOL

659
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
AND ARE SAFE, BUT THE PROBLEM IS

660
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
WHEN WE DO HAVE SOMETHING AWFUL

661
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
HAPPEN EVEN TO ONE CHILD THEN

662
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
THAT TAKES THE HEARTS OF EVERY

663

PARENT AND EVERY HUMAN INTO HIGH

664
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
ALERT.

665
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
IT'S NORMAL AND NATURAL FOR US

666
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
TO GET MORE CONCERNED ABOUT

667
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
SECURITY.

668
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
THERE ARE MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE

669
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
BUT THERE ARE CRIMINAL MINDS.

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
THEY WERE TERRIFIED.

748
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
>> MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF

749
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
THE VICTIMS AND IN THE WORDS,

750
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
HEAL THE BROKENHEARTED AND BIND

751
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
UP THEIR WOUNDS.

752
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
>> Gregg: KNEW, AS WE TRY TO

753
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
MAKE SENSE OF THIS TERRIBLE, WE

754
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
GO TO MIKE TOBIN WITH THE VERY

755
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
LATEST.

756
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
>> Reporter: YOU MENTIONED HOW

757
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
THIS IS TOWN SMALL ENOUGH THAT

758
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
EVERYONE KNOWS SOMEONE WHO HAS

759
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
BEEN TOUCHED BY THIS TRAGEDY.

760
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
THEY ARE COMINGETHER TO

761
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
GRIEVE.

762
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
FOCAL POINT FOR THE GRIEVING HAS

763
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
BECOME ST. ROSE OF LIMA CATHOLIC

764
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
CHURCH.

765
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
WE SAW PEOPLE GETTING THEIR ARMS

766
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
AROUND EACH OTHER AS THEY ARE

767
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
TRYING TO GET THEIR ARMS AROUND

768
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
WHAT HAPPENED.

769
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
BRACING EACH OTHER AS THEY TRY

770
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
TO GET THROUGH THIS TRAGEDY.

771
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE

772
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
WE'VE NEVER BEEN FACED WITH

773
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
SOMETHING OF THIS MAGNITUDE.

774
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
OUR FOCUS IS THE KIDS.

775
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME DEALING WITH

776
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
IT AS ADULTS, PROCESSING ALL THE

777
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
INFORMATION BUT THE FOCUS IS THE

778
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
KIDS AND TRYING TO GET THEM

779
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
THROUGH THIS.

780
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
>> Reporter: FOR OBVIOUS REASONS

781
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
THE SCHOOLS ALL WENT TO LOCKDOWN

782
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
AS INFORMATION CAME OUT AND

783
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
SLOWLY AND SURELY THE KIDS BEGIN

784
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
TO LEARN THIS WAS NOT A DRILL.

785
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
>> ALL THE KIDS WHO HAD SIBLINGS

786
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
THERE WERE SO WORRIED AND DIDN'T

787
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

788
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
>> Reporter: THOSE REMARKABLY

789
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
LITTLE GIRLS ATTEMPTED TO

790
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
CONSOLE THEIR CLASSMATES AND

791
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER.

792
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
THEY JUST DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH

793
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
INFORMATION.

794
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
THAT BEING SAID.

795
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
GRIEF COUNSELORS HAVE BEEN SENT

796
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
TO THIS TOWN.

797
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
VOLUNTEERS FROM ALL OF THE

798
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
NEIGHBORING STATES.

799
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT SECTIONS

800
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
OF THE GRIEF COUNSELING

801
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
OPERATION, ONE FOR ADULTS AND

802
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
ONE FOR CHILDREN.

803
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
CHILDREN SECTION THEY PUT EXTRA

804
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
EFFORT TO TRY TO TAKE THE EDGE

805
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
OFF THE KIDS.

806
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
THEY HAVE THERAPY DOGS THERE AND

807
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
ROOMS FILLED WITH STUFFED

808
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
ANIMALS.

809
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
ON A BRIGHT NOTE THOSE TOYS HAVE

810
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
BEEN SENT IN BY PEOPLE FROM ALL

811
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
OVER THE COUNTRY.

812
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
>> Gregg: MIKE, THANK YOU.

813
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
>> Heather: AS THE ENTIRE NATION

814
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
COMES TO GRIPS WITH THE SHOOTING

815
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
RAMPAGE IN CONNECTICUT.

816
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
NEWTOWN RESIDENTS ARE SEARCHING

817
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
FOR ANSWERS, REALLY THE WHOLE

818
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
COUNTRY IS WHILE TRYING TO COPE

819
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
WITH THE TRAGEDY AND LOSS OF 20

820
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
YOUNG CHILDREN.

821
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
YOU SO HOW WERE THESE RESIDENTS

822
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
BEGIN TO FIND PEACE AGAIN.

823
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
FATHER JONATHAN MORRIS IS A

824
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
CONTRIBUTOR AND JOINS US NOW.

825
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
HOW DO ANY OF US BEGIN TO MAKE

826
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
SENSE OF THIS TRAGEDY?

827
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
>> IF I WERE THERE, HEATHER, MY

828
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
ONLINE ANSWER WOULD BE A HUG.

829
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
MY ONLY ANSWER WOULD BE TO THOSE

830
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
THAT ARE SUFFERING MOST DEEPLY

831
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
BECAUSE THERE IS NO THEOLOGICAL

832
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
SOLUTION TO THIS EXCEPT HEAVEN.

833
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
EXCEPT ETERNAL LIFE BUT THAT IS

834
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
NOT WHAT THESE FAMILIES ARE

835
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

836
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
A LITTLE BIT THOSE THAT WERE

837
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
WATCHING TRYING TO FIND ANSWERS.

838
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
LET ME TELL YOU HOW I DEAL WITH

839
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
THIS.
WHEN I LOOK AT SUCH TERRIBLE

840
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
ABUSES OF FREE WILL LIKE THIS.

841
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
THE FIRST THING I DO IS CRY.

842
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
THE SECOND THING I DO IS TO

843
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
STAND IN AWE OF HOW MUCH GOD

844
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
MUCH VALUE THE PROPERTIES OF

845
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
FREEDOM WHICH IS LOVE.

846
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
TO VALUE IT SO MUCH HE WOULD

847
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
RISK A VERY SMALL PART OF THE

848
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
POPULATION ABUSING IT IN WAY

849
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
THAT WOULD AFFECT THE LITTLE

850
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
CHILDREN, THE LEAST OF THESE THE

851
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
MOST LOVED SO GRAVELY AND

852
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
DEEPLY.
I THINK GOD IS WITH THE FAMILIES

853
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
RIGHT NOW.

854
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
HE WAS WITH THE CHILDREN WHEN

855
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
THEY SUFFERED AND DIED AND HE

856
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
WILL BE WITH ALL OF US AS WE

857
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
DECIDE TO DOUBLE DOWN ON LOVE

858
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
WHICH IS THE ONLY SOLUTION UNTIL

859
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
WE GET TO THE HEAVEN.

860
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
>> Heather: IS THAT THE ANSWER

861
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
TO THE QUESTION, IF YOU BELIEVE

862
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
IN GOD, WHY WOULD GOD ALLOW THIS

863
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
TO HAPPEN BECAUSE HE DID THIS

864
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
FREE WILL?

865
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
>> ITS GREAT QUESTION.

866
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
ITS REAL QUESTION, I WISH I

867
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
COULD SAY THERE WAS A PERFECT

868
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
ANSWER.

869
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
BUT I DO BELIEVE FROM THE BIBLE

870
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
AND FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE, THAT

871
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
GOD DOES MAKES US A PROMISE.

872
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
OUT OF EVERY SINGLE INSTANCE OF

873
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
SUFFERING AND EVIL IN THIS WORLD

874
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
HE WILL BRING OUT A GREATER GOOD

875
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
IF WE LET HIM.

876
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
IT'S NOT A PROMISE THAT IT WILL

877
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
BE IMMEDIATE BUT IT'S A PROMISE

878
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
THAT HE KNOWS US, HE LOVES US

879
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
AND HE CARES US.

880
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
IT'S ULTIMATE SOLUTION IS BEING

881
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
IN HEAVEN AND ETERNITY.

882
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
LOVING ONE ANOTHER AND HUGGING

883
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
ONE ANOTHER AND SAYING, WE'RE

884
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
GOING TO DOUBLE DOWN ON LOVE.

885
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
>> Heather: RIGHT HERE AT THIS

886
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
TIME OF YEAR, CHRISTMAS,

887
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
HANUKKAH AND LITTLE CHILDREN

888
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
EXCITED ABOUT PRESENTS AND GIFTS

889
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
THE TIME WHAT IS A TIME OF HOPE,

890
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
HOW DO THESE FAMILIES MOVE

891
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
FORWARD DURING THIS TIME IN

892
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
PARTICULAR?

893
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
WE HEARD FAMILIES AND RESIDENTS

894
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
TAKING DOWN THEIR CHRISTMAS

895
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
DECORATIONS BECAUSE THEY FEEL

896
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
GUILTY?
>> THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE.

897
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
WE'RE NOT SPIRITUAL BEINGS BUT

898
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
WE'RE EMOTIONAL BEINGS AND WE'RE

899
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
SPIRITUAL BEINGS.

900
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
THOSE THREE ELEMENTS NEEDS TO BE

901
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
RESPECTED.

902
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I WOULD NEVER GO IN HERE IS THE

903
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
THEOLOGICAL SOLUTION.

904
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I WOULD BE THERE CLOSELY

905
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY

906
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
AND MAKE SURE THEIR PHYSICAL

907
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
NEEDS ARE MET.

908
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
NEIGHBORS BRINGING FOOD OVER TO

909
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
NEIGHBORS AND NEIGHBORS SENDING

910
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
CARDS AND GIFTS.

911
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
WE HEARD THAT FROM MIKE TOBIN

912
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
PEOPLE SENDING TED DPI BEARS.

913
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
THAT IS GOD'S WAY OF REACHING

914
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
OUT TO THOSE THAT SUFFER.

915
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
YOU AND ME BEING THE HANDS AND

916
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
FEET OF JESUS.

917
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
>> Heather: WHAT SHOULD OTHER

918
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
PEOPLE SAY TO THEIR CHILDREN?

919
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
>> I THINK SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE

920
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
TOLD ME TODAY THROUGH SOCIAL

921
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
MEDIA, WHAT DO I SAY TO MY KIDS.

922
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE, JUST BE

923
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
VERY CLEAR AND CON CONCISE ABOUT

924
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
THE THINGS YOU KNOW.

925
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
YOU ARE NOT IN DANGER RIGHT NOW.

926
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I WILL PROTECT YOU.

927
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
YOU CAN'T PROTECT PERFECTLY BUT

928
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
A PARENT CAN SAY TO HIS CHILD, I

929
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
WILL PROTECT YOU.

930
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
SECONDLY, YOU CAN SAY THAT YOUR

931
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
PLACE OF EDUCATION IS SAFE,

932
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
CLEAR SIMPLE ANSWERS.

COLLEAGUES HAVE SEEN.

1288
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
THEY WORKED WELL INTO THE NIGHT

1289
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
TO TRY TO BRING FAMILIES CLOSURE

1290
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
AND IDENTIFY THE VICTIMS, TO

1291
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
COMPLETE THEIR VERY DIFFICULT

1292
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
TASK AND ABLE TO REUNITE THE

1293
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
LOVED ONES WITH THEIR FAMILIES

1294
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
THAT IN THE COMING DAYS WILL BE

1295
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
PLANNING FUNERALS AND MEMORIAL

1296
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
SERVICES AS THIS INVESTIGATION

1297
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
CONTINUES.
THE SCHOOL IS STILL AN ACTIVE

1298
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
INVESTIGATION.
>> Gregg: WE WANT TO GO LIVE TO

1299
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
THE GOVERNOR, DAN MALLOY OF

1300
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
CONNECTICUT.

1301
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
LET'S LISTEN.
>> INDEED THE PEOPLE OF THE

1302
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
WORLD WEEP FOR THE IMMEASURABLE

1303
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
LOSSES SUFFERED BY THE FAMILIES

1304
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
AND LOVED ONES OF THESE VICTIMS.

1305
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
THOUGH WE COULD ALL TRY WHEN

1306
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
SOMETHING AS SENSELESS AS THIS

1307
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
OCCURS, THERE IS PRECIOUS LITTLE

1308
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
ANYONE CAN SAY TO THE FAMILIES

1309
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
THAT WILL LESSEN THE HORROR AND

1310
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
SENSE OF LOSS THEY FEEL.

1311
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
WE COULD SAY WE FEEL THEIR PAIN,

1312
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
BUT THE TRUTH IS, WE CAN'T.

1313
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
WHEN TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS TAKE

1314
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
PLACE, PEOPLE OFTEN LOOK FOR

1315
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
ANSWERS, AN EXPLANATION OF HOW

1316
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED.

1317
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
THE SAD TRUTH IS, THERE ARE NO

1318
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
ANSWERS.
NO GOOD ONES, ANYWAY.

1319
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
WE HAVE ALL SEEN TRAGEDIES LIKE

1320
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
THIS PLAY OUT IN OTHER STATES

1321
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

1322
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
EACH TIME WE HAVE WONDERED HOW

1323
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
SOMETHING SO HORRIFIC COULD

1324
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
OCCUR AND WE HAVE THANKED GOD

1325
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN HERE IN

1326
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
OUR CONNECTICUT.

1327
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
BUT NOW SADLY IT HAS.

1328
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

1329
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
AS WAS NO DOUBT THE CASE LAST

1330
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
NIGHT, WE CAN HUG SOMEONE WE

1331
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
LOVE A LITTLE TIGHTER, AS HAS

1332
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
BEEN HAPPENING SINCE YESTERDAY,

1333
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
WE CAN SHOW AND SHARE WITH EACH

1334
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
OTHER THE GRIEF WE FEEL FOR THE

1335
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
CHILDREN AND ADULTS WHO WERE

1336
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
KILLED AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES

1337
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
AND LOVED ONES.

1338
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
WE CAN SPEAK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY

1339
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
IMPORTANT AND WHAT CAN WAIT FOR

1340
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
ANOTHER DAY.

1341
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
THERE WILL BE TIME SOON FOR A

1342
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
DISCUSSION OF PUBLIC POLICY

1343
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
ISSUES SURROUNDING YESTERDAY'S

1344
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
EVENTS.

1345
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW

1346
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
IS LOVE, COURAGE, AND

1347
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
COMPASSION.
LOVE AS IT HAS POURED IN FROM

1348
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
AROUND THE WORLD.

1349
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
COURAGE AS IT WAS DEMONSTRATED

1350
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
BY THE TEACHERS AND OTHER ADULTS

1351
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
IN THE SCHOOL BUILDING WHOSE

1352
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
ACTIONS NO DOUBT SAVED LIVES.

1353
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
COURAGE ON DISPLAY AS IT ALWAYS

1354
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
IS BY OUR FIRST RESPONDERS.

1355
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
COMPASSION AS SHOWN BY PEOPLE

1356
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
FROM AROUND CONNECTICUT WHO HAVE

1357
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
ARRIVED IN NEWTOWN WANTING ONLY

1358
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
TO HELP.

1359
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
TOO OFTEN WE FOCUS ON WHAT

1360
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
DIVIDES US AS A PEOPLE INSTEAD

1361
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
OF WHAT BINDS US AS HUMAN

1362
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
BEINGS.
WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAY WERE THOSE

1363
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
BONDS, THAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY.

1364
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
IN THE COMING DAYS, WE WILL RELY

1365
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
ON THAT WHICH WE HAVE BEEN

1366
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
TAUGHT AND THAT WHICH WE

1367
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
INHERENTLY BELIEVE, THAT WE HAVE

1368
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
FAITH FOR A REASON AND THAT

1369
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
FAITH IS GOD'S GIFT TO US ALL.

1370
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
THOSE EDUCATORS AND THOSE

1371
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
INNOCENT LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS

1372
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR FAMILIES

1373
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
FAR TOO SOON.

1374
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
LET US ALL HOPE AND PRAY THOSE

1375
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
CHILDREN ARE NOW IN A PLACE

1376
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
WHERE THAT INNOCENCE WILL

1377
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
FOREVER BE PROTECTED.

1378
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND MAY GOD

1379
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
BLESS THOSE 27 PEOPLE.

1380
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
MAY GOD BLESS THEIR FAMILIES AND

1381
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
FRIENDS AND MAY THE PAIN THEIR

1382
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
LOVED ONES FEEL BE SOME DAY

1383
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:02,000
ABSORBED BY THE LOVE OF ALL MAN

1384
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
KIND.

MOLLY, I APOLOGIZE FOR THE

1394
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
INTERRUPTION.
WE DID WANT TO HEAR FROM THE

01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
SCENE.

>> THE UNFORTUNATE THING SPEAK

1400
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
MORE TO THE TRAGEDY AND HOW

1401
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
HORRIFIC IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR

1402
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
THESE CHILDREN AND FOR THESE

1403
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
WOMEN THAT WERE GUNNED DOWN IN

1404
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
WHAT REALLY AMOUNTS TO A

1405
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
MASSACRE.

1406
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER SAYING THEY

1407
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
SUFFERED MULTIPLE GUNSHOT

1408
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
WOUNDS, THAT THIS WAS A RIFLE

1409
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
THAT WAS USED AND IN HIS WORDS,

1410
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
THE WOUNDS WERE ALL OVER.

1411
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
IN OTHER WORDS, THERE WAS NO

1412
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
PARTICULAR AREA OF ANY

1413
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
PARTICULAR VICTIM'S BODY THAT

1414
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
THE SHOOTER APPEARED TO BE

1415
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
AIMING FOR.

1416
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT

1417
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
WERE GUNNED DOWN HAD MULTIPLE

1418
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

1419
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER SAYING HE

1420
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
DID SEVEN OF THE ASSESSMENTS

1421
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
HIMSELF AND THAT EACH OF THE

1422
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
VICTIMS THAT HE ANDED HAD

1423
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
BETWEEN THREE AND 11 GUNSHOT

1424
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
WOUNDS WITH AT LEAST TWO

1425
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
SUFFERING CLOSE RANGE GUN SHOTS.

1426
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT HOW

1427
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
PRECISE THIS GUNMAN WAS, HE SAID

1428
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
HE COULDN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THAT

1429
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
'CAUSE THAT WAS A DIFFICULT

1430
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
THING TO SPEAK TO.

1431
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
HE ALSO WANTED TO MAKE IT CLEAR

1432
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
THAT HIS JOB, ESSENTIALLY THE

1433
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
PAPERWORK WAS COMPLETED AND

1434
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
THESE LOVED ONES, THESE

1435
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
CHILDREN, THESE WIVES, THESE

1436
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
MOTHERS WOULD BE ABLE TO BE

1437
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
BROUGHT BACK TOGETHER WITH THEIR

1438
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
FAMILIES SO THE PLANNING COULD

1439
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
BEGIN FOR FUNERALS AND MEMORIAL

1440
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
SERVICES AND THE COMMUNITY COULD

1441
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
BEGIN TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THE

1442
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
GRIEF THEY'LL BE SUFFERING.

1443
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE WE'VE

1444
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
SPOKEN TO SINCE ARRIVING IN THIS

1445
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
SMALL COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN
WAITING TO HEAR THE NAMES OF ALL

1446
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
OF THESE VICTIMS TO FIND OUT IF

1447
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
THIS WAS SOMEONE THEY KNEW OR IF

1448
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
IT WAS A CHILD OF SOMEONE THAT

1449
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
THEY WERE CLOSE TO.

1450
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
NOW THOSE NAMES ARE COMING OUT

1451
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
TONIGHT AND MANY OF THE PEOPLE

1452
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
HERE WILL BE FINDING OUT IF IT'S

1453
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
SOMEONE THEY KNOW OR IF IT'S

1454
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
SOMEONE THAT MEANS A LOT TO THE

1455
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
PEOPLE CLOSE TO THEM.

1456
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
BUT THE COMMUNITY HAS ALL COME

1457
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
TOGETHER AND AT THIS POINT, THEY

1458
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
HAVE FELT AND FEARED THAT THEY

1459
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
WOULD KNOW SOMEONE AND THEY ALL

1460
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT MUCH CLOSER

1461
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
TOGETHER.

1462
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
GREGG?

1463
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
>> Gregg: I JUST WANT TO CLEAR

1464
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
UP, DID THE NEWS CONFERENCE

1465
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
CLARIFY THE USE, IN ADDITION TO

1466
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
TWO SEMIAUTOMATIC HAND GUNS, THE

1467
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
USE OF AN ASSAULT RIFLE?

1468
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
>> THERE WERE QUESTIONS ASKED

1469
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
ABOUT THE WEAPONS BECAUSE THAT'S

1470
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
BEEN A DEVELOPING PART OF ALL OF

1471
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
THIS INVESTIGATION AND

1472
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND LAST MORE

1473
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
THAN 24 HOURS, WE'VE GOTTEN

1474
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
MULTIPLE DIFFERENT STORIES FROM

1475
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
DIFFERENT LAW ENFORCEMENT

1476
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
SOURCES.
SOME FEDERAL AND SOME LOCAL HERE

1477
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
ON THE GROUND.
WE'RE TRYING TO CLARIFY THAT AT

1478
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
THE PRESS CONFERENCE THIS

1479
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
AFTERNOON.

1480
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
THAT DIDN'T REALLY HAPPEN.

1481
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
WE STILL HAVE WORD THAT THERE

1482
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
WERE GUNS FOUND INSIDE THE

1483
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
SCHOOL, BUT THE CLARIFICATION

1484
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
ACTUALLY BECAME LESS CLEAR

1485
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
REALLY.

1486
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
HE SAID -- LIEUTENANT VANCE

1487
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
SPEAKING THIS AFTERNOON,

1488
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
RELEASING MUCH OF THE

1489
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
INFORMATION, SAID THAT MAYBE

1490
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
TOMORROW MORNING THEY'D BE ABLE

1491
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
TO CLARIFY HOW MANY OF THE GUNS

1492
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
WERE THERE, HOW MANY HAVE BEEN

1493
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
FIRED, POSSIBLY THE NUMBER OF

1494
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
ROUNDS, THAT SORT OF THING WOULD

1495
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
BECOME MORE CLEAR.

1496
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE STILL WORKING

1497
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
THROUGH THAT.

1498
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
>> Gregg: ALL RIGHT.

1499
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
MOLLY LINE LIVE IN NEWTOWN,

1500
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
CONNECTICUT.

1501
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
THANK YOU.
>> Heather: THERE IS NO WAY TO

1502
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
COMPARE ONE HEARTBREAKING

1503
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
TRAGEDY TO ANOTHER OTHER THAN

1504
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
MAYBE TO CONSIDER ITS PLACE IN

1505
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
HISTORY.

1506
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
IT'S HARD TO CONCEIVE SOMETHING

1507
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
WORSE THAN THIS SCENE YOU'LL

1508
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
REMEMBER FROM APRIL OF 2007.

1509
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
A STUDENT KILLED 32 FELLOW

1510
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
STUDENTS AND FACULTY AT VIRGINIA

1511
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
TECH IN BLACKSBURG, VIRGINIA.

1512
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
IT'S THE WORST SINGLE ACT OF GUN

1513
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
VIOLENCE IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

1514
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
THE ONLY SCHOOL SHOOTING THAT

1515
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
INVOLVED MORE FATALITIES THAN

1516
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN CONNECTICUT AND

1517
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
SO FAR FOR SO MANY OF US, TODAY

1518
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
WAS ALSO A REMINDER OF THIS DAY

1519
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
ON APRIL 20, 1999.

1520
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
THAT IS WHEN THE NOW INFAMOUS

1521
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,000
NAMES, DILL LEANCALLY BOLD --

1522
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
DYLAN KLEBOLD AND ERIC HARRIS.

1523
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
THAT AT COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL.

1524
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
WE RECALL CHARLES WHITMAN, THE

1525
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
ENGINEERING STUDENT AND FORGER

1526
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
MARINE WHO KILLED 13 PEOPLE AND

1527
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
AN UNBORN CHILD AND WOUNDED 32

1528
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
OTHERS IN A SHOOTING RAMPAGE

1529
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
FROM THE TOWER OF THE UNIVERSITY

1530
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
OF TEXAS.

1531
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
THAT WAS ON AUGUST 1, 1966.

1532
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
HIS MURDEROUS RAMPAGE CAUGHT ON

1533
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
TV CAMERA.

1534
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
>> Gregg: NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT

1535
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
IS A TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY AND

1536
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
HOW SOME OF THOSE WHO CALL THE

1537
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
TOWN HOME ARE SPEAKING OUT ABOUT

1538
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT IT WILL

1539
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,000
TAKE TO GET THROUGH THIS.

1540
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
>> YESTERDAY HE SAID MY SCHOOL

1541
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
IS DEAD.
THE KIDS ARE STILL -- HE SAID

1542
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
NO, MOM.

1543
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
THE SCHOOL IS DEAD.

1544
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
MRS. HOCHSPRUNG ISN'T GOING TO

1545
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
BE THERE AND WE'LL ALL KNOW WHEN

1546
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
WE GO TO SCHOOL.

1547
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
SO IF MY SCHOOL FOR ME IS DEAD.

1548
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I THINK IN HIS WAY, IT'S NEVER

1549
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
GOING TO BE THE SAME.

1550
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
>> WE ARE ALL A QUIET LITTLE

1551
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
TOWN THAT NOTHING EVER HAPPENS.

1552
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
NOW SUDDENLY WE'RE IN THE RECORD

1553
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
BOOKS, NOT BECAUSE SOMEONE WON

1554
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
THE LOTTERY LAST WEEK, BUT FOR

1555
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
SOMETHING ELSE.

1556
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
>> WE KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE.

1557
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I CAN'T GO TO THE GROCERY STORE

1558
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
WITHOUT MEETING PEOPLE THAT

1559
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
MIGHT KNOW AND I JUST CAN'T

1560
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
IMAGINE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE

1561
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
STORES NOW WHEN PEOPLE MEET EACH

1562
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
OTHER.
WE'RE GOING TO BE TALK BEING

1563
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
THIS FOR YEARS.

1564
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
THE PAIN WILL LAST FOR YEARS.

1565
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
>> WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK.

1566
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
IT WILL ALWAYS BE IN OUR MINDS,

1567
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
JUST AS 9-11 IS ALWAYS ON OUR

1568
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
MINDS.
I HAVEN'T FELT THIS WAY SINCE

1569
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
9-11.

1570
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
BUT THE TOWN IS RESILIENT.

1571
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK AND

1572
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?

1573
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
>> Gregg: THE NATION JOINING

1574
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
NEWTOWN RESIDENTS IN THEIR GRIEF

1575
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
TODAY AS WELL.

1576
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
>> Heather: OUT OF THIS TRAGEDY

1577
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
WE ARE HEARING HEROIC STORIES OF

1578
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
THE SANDY HOOK SCHOOL STAFF,

1579
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
SACRIFICING THEMSELVES TO SAVE

1580
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
THE LIVES OF THE STUDENTS.

1581
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
AND THAT INCLUDES PRINCIPAL DAWN

1582
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
HOCHSPRUNG, TOWN OFFICIALS SAY

1583
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
THAT SHE DID NOT HESI HESITATE ,

1584
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
RUNNING INTO THE HALLWAY,

1585
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
STRAIGHT FORT GUNMAN AND LUNGING

1586
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
AT HIM.

1587
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
HE REPORTEDLY THEN SHOT AND

1588
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
KILLED HER.

1589
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
OTHER TEACHERS PROTECTING THEIR

1590
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
STUDENTS BY LOBBING THEIR

1591
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
CLASSROOM DOORS, HIDING CHILDREN

1592
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
TO KEEP THEM SAFE AND ONE

1593
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
TEACHER REPORTEDLY READING

1594
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
STORIES TO THE KIDS TO TRY TO

1595
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
KEEP THEM CALM WHILE ANOTHER

1596
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
27-YEAR-OLD VICTORIA SOTO, YOUNG

1597
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
FIRST GRADE TEACHER, HID HER

1598
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
STUDENTS IN A CLOSET BEFORE THE

1599
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
GUNMAN KILLED HER.

1600
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
SANDY HOOK'S LIBRARY CLERK

1601
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
DESCRIBED WHAT SHE DID ONCE SHE

1602
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
REALIZED HER KIDS WERE IN

1603
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
DANGER.
>> WE KNEW, I TOLD THEM WHEN WE

1604
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
STARTED ON THE INTERCOM IN THE

1605
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
OFFICE WENT OFF, AND THEN WE

1606
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
HEARD SCUFFLING NOISES AND STUFF

1607
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
AND I THOUGHT SOMEBODY HAD HIT

1608
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
THE BUTTON BY MISTAKE AND THEY

1609
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
WERE IN THE OFFICE.
SOY CALLED DOWN THERE AND ONE OF

1610
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
THE SECRETARIES ANSWERED THE

1611
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
PHONE AND SAID THERE IS A

1612
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
SHOOTING.
AND THEN YOU BECOME AWARE.

1613
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
WE STARTED HEARING THE GUN

1614
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
SHOTS.

1615
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
SO I YELLED LOCKDOWN TO THE

1616
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
GROUP IN OUR ROOM AND I RAN

1617
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
ACROSS THE HALL AND TOLD THE

1618
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
CLASSROOM ACROSS IT WAS A

1619
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
LOCKDOWN.

1620
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
THE ONE ACROSS THE HALL FROM ME.

1621
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I THINK SOME OF THE KIDS WERE

1622
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
SCARED, BUT THEY'RE SCARED EVEN

1623
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
WHEN IT'S A DRILL.

1624
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
IT'S A SCARY THING.

1625
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
EVEN WHEN WE HAVE OUR FIRE ALARM

1626
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
DRILLS.
WHEN IT GOES OFF, YOUR

1627
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
ADRENALINE STARTS GOING.

1628
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
IT'S SCARY FOR LITTLE KIDS.

1629
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I DON'T THINK UNTIL WE OPEN THE

1630
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
DOOR AND THERE WAS 15 STATE COPS

1631
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
WITH THESE GIGANTIC GUNS AND

1632
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
FEDERAL AGENTS ESCORTING THE

1633
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
KIDS OUT DID THEY REALLY --

1634
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
>> WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR

1635
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
MIND IN THE CLOSET?

1636
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
WHAT THE CHILDREN WERE SAYING?

1637
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
>> IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW

1638
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
LONG DID IT TAKE?

1639
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
>> WE DIDN'T KNOW -- WE WOULDN'T

1640
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
LET THEM IN AT FIRST.

1641
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
SO THEY WERE POUNDING ON THE

1642
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
DOOR SAYING THEY WERE POLICE AND

1643
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
THEY HAD SOMEONE CALL US AND

1644
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
THEY ALSO PUT A BADGE UNDER THE

1645
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
DOOR AND THAT'S WHEN WE MOVED

1646
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
THE FIRE CABINETS AND STARTED

1647
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
LETTING THE KIDS OUT TO THEM.

1648
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
>> Heather: HO HONOR THEIR

1649
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
BRAVERY, HUG A TEACHER SIGNS ARE

1650
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
HANGING THROUGHOUT THE TOWN.

1651
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
>> Gregg: THE SCHOOL TRAGEDY

1652
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
DRAWING EMOTIONAL REACTION ALL

1653
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
OVER THE COUNTRY.

1654
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
PARENTS CAN SYMPATHIZE WITH

1655
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
THOSE WHEN LOST THEIR CHILDREN

1656
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
IN NEWTOWN, BUT AS WE ALL TRY TO

1657
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
MAKE SENSE OF THIS TRAGEDY, HOW

1658
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
DO WE EXPLAIN IT TO OUR OWN

1659
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
KIDS?

1660
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
DOMINIC WITH ATTEND OF THE

1661
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
STORY.

1662
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
>> IT'S AN EXTREMELY HARD THING

1663
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
TO DO.
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER THE KIDS

1664
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:01,000
ACROSS THE NATION WERE EXPOSED

1665
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
TO THESE EVENTS IN REAL TIME

1666
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,000
THROUGH FACEBOOK.

1667
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE SAYING PARENTS

1668
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
REALLY DON'T WANT TO LET THEIR

1669
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
KIDS GET CARRIED AWAY NOW BY

1670
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
TWEETS AND UPDATES AND ADVISING

1671
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
PARENTS TO CALMLY EXPLAIN THE

1672
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
ACTUAL FACTS AND START

1673
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
DISCUSSING THE CHILD'S FEELINGS

1674
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
AND THEIR FEARS AS WELL.

1675
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
THESE ARE SOME OF THE TYPICAL

1676
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD ASK.

1677
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
>> WHAT DID YOU THINK?

1678
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
WERE YOU EVER AFRAID THAT THAT

1679
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
COULD HAPPEN AT YOUR SCHOOL?

1680
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
WELL, WHAT IF IT HAPPENED AT

1681
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
YOUR SCHOOL?

1682
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WOULD

1683
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
HAPPEN, THE TEACHERS WOULD STEP

1684
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
IN.
THE POLICE WOULD BE THERE.

1685
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
MOMMY AND DADDY WOULD RUSH TO

1686
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
THE SCHOOL OR WHATEVER AND SO

1687
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
DON'T BE AFRAID TO LET YOUR KID

1688
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
EXPRESS AND PUT WORDS TO AND

1689
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
TALK ABOUT WHAT'S ALREADY INSIDE

1690
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
OF THEM.

1691
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
>> DESPITE WHAT KIDS ARE READING

1692
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
ON-LINE OR HEARING IN THE SCHOOL

1693
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
YARD, PSYCHOLOGISTS SAY IT'S

1694
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
STILL VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO

1695
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
CONSIDER THE AGE AND HOW MUCH

1696
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
APPROPRIATE DETAIL YOU GIVE

1697
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
THEM.

1698
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
ONE CHILD EXPERT SAYING THE
YOUNGER THEY ARE, THE MORE

1699
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
DIFFICULT THAT IS FOR A PARENT

1700
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
TO DO.

1701
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

1702
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
>> SOMEONE OF A YOUNG SCHOOL

1703
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
AGE, THEY MIGHT NOT APPRECIATE

1704
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
THE PERMANENCY OF DEATH.

1705
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
IS JOHNNY GOING TO BE AT THE

1706
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
NEXT SOCCER MATCH, OR WHEN WILL

1707
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I GET TO SEE HIM?

1708
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
SO SOMETIMES THERE MIGHT BE

1709
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
REPEATED QUESTIONS.
THEY MIGHT HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT

1710
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.
LET IT GO.

1711
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
COME BACK AGAIN.

1712
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
>> GREGG, ALSO HARD TO DEAL WITH

1713
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
IS THE FACT THAT THE VERY YOUNG

1714
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
KIDS, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

1715
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
THEY ENCOUNTER THEIR OWN SENSE

1716
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
OF MORTALITY.

1717
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
YOU MAY NEED TO EXPLAIN TO THEM

1718
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
THAT THE REPLAY OF EVENTS

1719
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
THEY'RE SAYING ON TV ISN'T A

1720
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
PERPETUAL CONVENIENT WHERE

1721
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
THEY'RE IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF

1722
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
CONTINUOUS DEATH.

1723
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
IT MAY BE WHY IT'S GOOD TO TURN

1724
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
THE TV OFF OR IT COULD TRIGGER

1725
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
PTSD.

1726
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
OR IT'S IMPORTANT SAY THE

1727
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS THAT PARENTS

1728
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
INSURE THAT KIDS DON'T DEVELOP A

1729
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
FEAR OF GOING TO SCHOOL.

1730
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS SAYING THEY NEED
TO MAKE SURE THAT KIDS ARE IN

1731
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
CLASS ON MONDAY AND ENCOURAGE

1732
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
THEM THAT IT IS OKAY, THAT IT'S

1733
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
SAFE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL,

1734
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
GREGG.

1735
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
>> Gregg: DOMINIC IN LOS

1736
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
ANGELES.

1737
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
THANK YOU.

1738
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
IN CONNECTICUT IS NOT THE FIRST

1739
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
MASS SCHOOL SHOOTING.

1740
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
HOW IT COMPARES TO OTHER

1741
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
TRAGEDIES IN THE LESSONS THAT WE

>> Gregg: THE SHOOTING IN

1754
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT IS JUST THE

1755
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
LATEST TRAGEDY OF ITS KIND:  WE

1756
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
HAVE SEEN, UNFORTUNATELY,

1757
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
SIMILAR INCIDENTS INVOLVING

1758
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
ARMED, HEAVILY ARMED GUNMEN LIKE

1759
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
SUSPECTED SHOOTER ADAM LANZA.

1760
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
SOME WEARING MILITARY GARB.

1761
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
SOME PLANNING, KILLING A LARGE

1762
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

1763
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
IN 2007 -- EXCUSE ME, 2011,

1764
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
JARED LOUGHNER TARGETED CONGRESS

1765
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
ON YOUR CORNER EVENT IN TUCSON,

1766
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
ARIZONA.

1767
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
HE SHOT AND KILLED SIX PEOPLE

1768
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
AND WOUNDED 12 OTHERS, INCLUDING

1769
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
GABBY GIFFORDS.

1770
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
LAST JULY, POLICE SAY JAMES

1771
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
HOLMES WORE A BULLET PROOF VEST

1772
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
AND OTHER TACTICAL GEAR WHEN HE

1773
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
OPENED FIRE INSIDE AN AURA MOVIE

1774
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
THEATER.
12 PEOPLE DIED IN THAT, DOZENS

1775
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
MORE WERE INJURED.

1776
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
AND IT WAS APRIL OF 1999 WHEN

1777
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
TWO YOUNG MEN SHOT AND KILLED 13

1778
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
PEOPLE INSIDE COLUMBINE HIGH

1779
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
SCHOOL IN COLORADO.

1780
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
DR. MICHAEL BAD SUN A FORENSIC

1781
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
PATHOLOGIST WHO JOINS US.
DO YOU SEE A PATTERN HERE?

1782
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
>> I THINK THE PATTERN IS YOUNG

1783
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
MEN, EARLY 20S, NOT WOMEN --

1784
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
THIS IS LARGELY SOMETHING THAT

1785
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:25,000
YOUNG MEN DO AND THEY OFTEN HAVE

1786
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
SIGNIFICANT MENTAL ILLNESS THAT

1787
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
HAS BEEN UNDIAGNOSED AND

1788
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
UNTREATED.

1789
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
SOMETIMES BECAUSE THEY'RE

1790
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
FUNCTIONING ALL RIGHT AND THEY

1791
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
WEAR SOMETIMES GOTH CLOTHING.

1792
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THIS IS

1793
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
UNUSUAL AND EVEN WITH THE

1794
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
MULTIPLE NUMBERS THAT YOU GAVE,

1795
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
31 OR 41 INCIDENTS, DOES USUALLY

1796
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
INVOLVE ONE OR TWO PEOPLE.

1797
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
NOT A MASS MURDER AS HERE WITH

1798
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
MORE THAN FIVE MURDERS.

1799
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
>> Gregg: TO THAT END, WILL IT

1800
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
BE IMPORTANT, THE AUTOPSY OF THE

1801
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
SHOOTER?

1802
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,000
>> YEAH.
THE AUTOPSY IS GOING TO BE VERY

1803
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE.

1804
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
FIRST THEY'LL DO A VERY DETAILED

1805
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
EXAMINATION OF THE BRAIN,

1806
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
MICROSCOPIC AND ALL THAT.

1807
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
BUT THEY'LL ALSO GET TOXICOLOGY

1808
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
TO SEE IF THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE

1809
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
BEEN ON ANY KIND OF DRUGS.

1810
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
DRUGS THAT WERE GIVEN BY MENTAL

1811
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,000
HEALTH WORKERS BECAUSE SOME --

1812
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
THERE HAS BEEN CONCERN THAT SOME

1813
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
OF THE DRUGS GIVEN TO DEPRESSED

1814
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
PEOPLE CAN MAKE SOME PEOPLE

1815
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
VIOLENT AND THIS HAPPENED WITH

1816
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
THE COLUMBINE PEOPLE.
I THINK HARRIS WAS ON ONE SUCH

1817
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
DRUG.
WHETHER THAT'S A COINCIDENCE OR

1818
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
NOT, WE DON'T KNOW YET.

1819
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
BUT THE PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS

1820
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
ALSO HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT TO

1821
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
MAKE SURE THEY DON'T INCREASE

1822
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
AGGRESSION IN SOME PEOPLE.

1823
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
>> Gregg: NOW, IT WAS REPORTED

1824
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
THAT THE BROTHER OF THE SHOOTER

1825
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
SAID HE SUFFERED FROM A

1826
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
PARTICULAR KIND OF AUTISM AND A

1827
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UNDERSTANDABLY

1828
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
OUTRAGED AT ANY CONNECTION,

1829
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
THEREFORE.

1830
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
>> YEAH.
I THINK IN GENERAL, THERE ARE SO

1831
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
MANY PEOPLE WITH AUTISM AND

1832
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
ESPECIALLY AS BURGERS WHO ARE

1833
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
FULLY FUNCTIONING.

1834
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
LOT OF DOCTORS WITH ASBURGER,

1835
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
THEY ARE VERY BRIGHT AND

1836
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
WHATEVER OTHER EMPATHY ISSUES

1837
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
THERE ARE IS BEING LOOKED INTO.

1838
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
BUT I THINK THAT -- FROM WHAT

1839
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I'VE SEEN, ABSOLUTELY NO

1840
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,000
INDICATION THAT PEOPLE WITH

1841
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
AUTISM OR ASBERGERS HAVE A HIGH

1842
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
INCIDENT OF KILLING PEOPLE, EVEN

1843
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
ONE PERSON THAN THE GENERAL

1844
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
PUBLIC.
>> Gregg: IN TRYING TO DETERMINE

1845
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
A MOTIVE HERE, THERE IS A WIDE

1846
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
VARIETY OF IT, I SUPPOSE,  WHICH

1847
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:40,000
CAN BE EXACERBATED BY ANY MENTAL

1848
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
ILLNESS UNDIAGNOSED.

1849
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
IT COULD BE A TWISTED EGO

1850
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
GRATIFICATION THAT'S DERIVED

1851
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
FROM THE ABILITY TO CONTROL AND

1852
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
TERRIFY MASS AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE.

1853
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
>> YEAH.

1854
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
AND THEN TO SEE YOUR NAME IN THE

1855
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
NEWSPAPERS OR TO LEAVE A LEGACY

1856
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
IN THE NEWSPAPERS THAT YOU KNOW

1857
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
THAT PEOPLE WILL PAY ATTENTION

1858
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
TO.
THIS IS THE WHOLE PROBLEM THAT

1859
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
YOU GUYS AND ME GUYS, TOO, ARE

1860
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
WE CONCERNED ABOUT COPY CATS?

1861
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
YES.

1862
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
WHEN THEY SEE ALL THE ATTENTION

1863
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
THAT'S PAID TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS

1864
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
NEVER HAD ATTENTION PAID TO THEM

1865
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
AT ALL, CAN THIS TRIGGER OFF

1866
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE VERY

1867
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
FRINGES OF SOCIETY?

1868
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE

1869
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
CONTROLLED.
THIS KIND OF EPISODE IS SO RARE

1870
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
AND SO UNUSUAL, THAT'S WHY WE'RE

1871
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:30,000
TALKING ABOUT IT, THAT ONE HAS

1872
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
TO BE CAREFUL ON WHAT TO DO --

1873
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
WE DON'T WANT AN ARMED STATE.

1874
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
IF WE HAVE OUR CHILDREN GROW UP

1875
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
IN SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS

1876
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
ALWAYS A POLICE OFFICER AROUND

1877
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
PROTECTING THEM, THAT ALSO HAS

1878
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
ITS POTENTIAL HARMFUL EFFECTS.

1879
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
>> Gregg: CRIMINOLOGIST WITH THE
MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF

1880
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
CORRECTIONS HAS WRITTEN A

1881
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
HISTORY OF MASS MURDERERS IN

1882
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
AMERICA AND HE SAID WHILE MASS

1883
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
SHOOTINGS ROSE BETWEEN THE 1960S

1884
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
AND 1990S, THEY ACTUALLY DROPPED

1885
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
IN THE 2000S.

1886
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
32 IN THE 1980S.

1887
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,000
42 IN 1990S.

1888
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
26 IN THE DECADE SINCE.

1889
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO

1890
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
BE CAREFUL OF, AS FAR AS DEATHS

1891
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
GO, 'CAUSE THESE ARE DEATHS,

1892
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
PEOPLE, BECAUSE OF BETTER

1893
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
MEDICAL CARE, THE SAME INJURIES

1894
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
THAT WOULD KILL PEOPLE IN THE

1895
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
'60S AND THE '70S DON'T KILL

1896
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
PEOPLE ANYMORE.

1897
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
YOU GET SOMEBODY TO A HOSPITAL

1898
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
QUICKLY ENOUGH AND PEOPLE WHO

1899
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
WOULD HAVE DIED FROM HEAD

1900
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
INJURIES OR BULLET WOUNDS IN THE

1901
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
'60S AND '70S ARE CONVERTD INTO

1902
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
ASSAULTS.

1903
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY

1904
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
DIFFERENCE --
>> Gregg: ALTHOUGH THIS

1905
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
CRIMINOLOGIST STUDY FOCUSES ON

1906
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
THE INCIDENTS, NOT THE NUMBER OF

1907
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
VICTIMS.
SO ONE WONDERS WHETHER -- WHEN

1908
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
IT HAPPENS, IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S

1909
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
HAPPENING SO OFTEN AND YET IN

1910
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
THE LARGER PICTURE, PERHAPS NOT.

1911
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1912
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
BUT HOWEVER, FOCUSING ON

1913
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,000
KINDERGARTEN, I DID A SEARCH OF

1914
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE

1915
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
MASS MURDERS AND THE ONLY ONE

1916
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
THAT I COULD FIND WAS BIGGER

1917
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
THAN THIS WAS A MURDER IN

1918
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
KINDERGARTEN IN THE 1920S IN

1919
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
BATH, MICHIGAN, WHERE A

1920
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
TREASURER OF THE SCHOOL BOARD

1921
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
TOOK A BOMB AND BLEW UP THE

1922
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
WHOLE SCHOOL.

1923
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
>> Gregg: RIGHT.

1924
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
>> THAT'S THE ONLY ONE WHICH

1925
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
CHILDREN WERE POINTED AT AND

1926
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
WERE KILLED IN THIS CRUEL WAY.

1927
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
MOST OF THESE OTHER MURDERS ARE

1928
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
OLDER PEOPLE.

1929
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
NOT THAT -- IT'S ITS OWN

1930
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
PROBLEM, LIKE COLLEGE STUDENTS
IN PARTICULAR, BUT TO TAKE OUT

1931
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
YOUR VENGEANCE ON SIX-YEAR-OLDS.

1932
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
>> Gregg: INNOCENT SIX AND

1933
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS.

1934
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
>> I THINK THE KEY TO THAT MAY

1935
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
BE IN THE RELATIONSHIP HE HAD

1936
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
WITH HIS MOTHER.

1937
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
>> Gregg: ALL RIGHT.

1938
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
WE MAY FIND MORE, DOCTOR, THANK

1939
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
YOU SO MUCH.

1940
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
>> THANK YOU.

1941
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
>> Gregg: HEATHER?

1942
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
>> Heather: OKAY.
RYE NOW WE HAVE SOME BREAK NEWS

1943
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
ON THIS.

1944
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
A ROBBIE PARKER APPARENTLY, THE

1945
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
FATHER OF ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN

1946
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
THE SHOOTING SPEAKING OUT.

1947
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
LET'S LISTEN IN.

1948
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
>> THAT I'VE BEEN SEEING IS I

1949
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
HAVE TWO REALLY GOOD FRIENDS AT

1950
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:22,000
HOME WHO HAVE SET UP A FACEBOOK

1951
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:27,000
PAGE TO HELP RAISE MONEY.

1952
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I HAVE SEEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

1953
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:33,000
WHO HAVE COMMENTED AND EXPRESSED

1954
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
CONDOLENCES.

1955
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
>> CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR

1956
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
DAUGHTER LOOKED LIKE FOR US?

1957
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
DO YOU HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH?

1958
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
>> THERE IS LOTS OF PICTURES ON

1959
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
EMILYPARKER FUND PAGE ON

1960
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
FACEBOOK.

1961
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL.

1962
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,000
SHE WAS BLOND, ALWAYS SMILING.

1963
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:02,000
(INAUDIBLE).

1964
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
>> HERE AT THE CHURCH LAST NIGHT

1965
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:14,000
THERE WAS A SPECIAL MEETING AND

1966
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I WAS GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO

1967
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
SPEAK ABOUT THAT AS WELL.

1968
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:22,000
IN THAT, I JUST MENTIONED THAT

1969
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
THE PERSON THAT CHOSE TO ACT IN

1970
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
THIS WAY WAS ACTING AS A GOD

1971
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,000
GIVEN RIGHTS -- OF HIS OWN FREE

1972
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
AGENCY.
THAT FREE AGENCY IS GIVEN TO ALL

1973
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
OF US, TO ACT AND CHOOSE TO DO

1974
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
WHATEVER WE WANT.

1975
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
AND GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY

1976
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
FROM US.

1977
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

1978
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
THAT HE WAS GIVEN AND THAT'S

1979
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
WHAT HE CHOSE TO DO WITH IT.

1980
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,000
I KNOW THAT GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT

1981
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
AWAY.

1982
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I'M NOT MAD BECAUSE I HAVE MY

1983
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
AGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT I USE

1984
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,000
IT TO DO WHAT I CAN TO DO

1985
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
WHATEVER I CAN TO ONE, MAKE SURE

1986
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
THAT MY FAMILY AND MY WIFE AND

1987
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
MY DAUGHTERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF

1988
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
AND THAT IF THERE IS ANYTHING I

1989
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
COULD DO TO HELP ANYBODY AT ANY

1990
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
TIME ANYWHERE, I WOULD BE

1991
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:17,000
WILLING TO DO THAT.

1992
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
>> Heather: YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING

1993
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
A LIVE NEWS CONFERENCE WITH

1994
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
ROBBIE PARKER, THE FATHER OF ONE

1995
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS DEADLY

1996
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
SHOOTING.
HIS DAUGHTER, EMILY, SHE

1997
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
APPARENTLY WAS JUST SIX YEARS

1998
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
OLD.

1999
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
HER BIRTHDAY MAY OF 2006.

2000
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
YOU HEARD HIM TALKING A LITTLE

2001
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
BIT ABOUT WHAT FATHER JONATHAN

2002
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
MORRIS TALKED ABOUT EARLIER, HE

2003
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
SAYING HE BELIEVES THE SHOOTER

2004

The Sleep Number bed
conforms to you.

2024
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I wake up in the morning
with no back pain.

2025
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
I can adjust it if I need
to...if my back's a little

2027

chambers which provide
ideal support and put you

2033
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
in control of the
firmness.

2034
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
And the bed is perfect for
couples because each side

2035
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
adjusts independently to
their unique Sleep Number.

2036

LAW ENFORCEMENT.

2379
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
I DON'T CARE HOW SEASONED THE

01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:31,000

THIS STUFF IS EVERYONE'SOR.

WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AND

2384
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN LOOK FOR IS

2385
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
THE NUMBER OF SHOTS TO EACH OF

2386
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
THE CHILD VICTIMS.

2387
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
THEY'RE COLLECTING SHELL

2388
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
CASINGS.
THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

2389
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
THEY HAVE THE FORENSICS, ANY

2390
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
FINGERPRINTS, WAS THERE A SECOND

2391
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
GUN?

2392
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
WAS THERE UNEXPENDED SHELLS OR

2393
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
SHELL CASINGS, AND THEY

2394
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,000
TRYING AT THIS POINT TO

2395
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
ESSENTIALLY DO A MAP OF HOW THIS

2396
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
HAPPENED, HOW THE SHOTS WERE

2397
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
FIRED, FROM WHERE, WHERE WERE

2398
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
THE CHILDREN, AND OF THE

2399
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
MULTIPLE GUNSHOT WOUNDS THAT WE

2400
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
KNOW HAPPENED TO THESE CHILDREN,

2401
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:10,000
OR AT LEAST FROM THE GLOCK AND

2402
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,000
THE SIG SAUER, WHICH CHILD

2403
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
SUFFERED THE FIRST SHOT AND

2404
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
SECOND.

2405
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
WAS IT A SPRAY OF BULLETS?

2406
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
WHAT WAS THE TYPE AND THE WAY

2407
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
THAT THIS EXECUTION OF THESE

2408
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
CHILDREN WENT DOWN?

2409
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
THIS IS A HORRIFIC CRIME SCENE.

2410
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,000
>> Gregg: THE OTHER CRIME SCENE

2411
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
IS THE SHOOTER'S HOME.

2412
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
I MEAN, THAT MAY, IN FACT, IN

2413
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
MANY WAYS IN SEARCH FOR THE

2414
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
ANSWER OF WHY, THAT MAY PROVE

2415
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
MORE PROFITABLE FOR LAW

2416
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
ENFORCEMENT?

2417
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
>> YEAH.

2418
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
WELL, I THINK GIVE US MORE

2419
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
INSIGHT INTO WHAT WAS DONE AND

2420
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,000
WHAT THE SCENARIO OF HOW IT WAS

2421
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
DONE.

2422
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
THERE ARE SOME REPORTS THAT THE

2423
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
MOTHER IS SLEEPING.

2424
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS

2425
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
CONFIRMED.

2426
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,000
WAS THERE A STRUGGLE?

2427
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
WERE THERE ISSUES THAT ANYTHING

2428
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
CAN GIVE US INFORMATION IN LAW

2429
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000

IT COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE A

2430
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
CIGARETTE BUTT OR AN OVERTURNED

2431
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
LAMP.
IT CAN BE A LETTER.

2432
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
IT CAN BE SOME KIND OF A

2433
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
MESSAGE.
AND MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS KID'S

2434

2438
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
NOT JUST AUTOPSIES ON THESE

2439
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:20,000

2440
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,000
UNMERCIFULLY KILLED HERE, BUT ON

01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
A PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY OF THE

2442
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,000
SHOOTER.
WHAT DID HE DO?

2443
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
WHY DID HE DO IT?

2444
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
WHAT DOES THE TOXICOLOGY TELL

2445
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
US?
WAS HE ON DRUGS OR MEDS?

2446
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,000
THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF WORK

2447
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
THAT HAS YET TO BE DONE, EVEN

2448
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,000
THOUGH THE SHOOTER IS DEAD.

2450
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000

2451
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
PROVE VALUABLE AS WELL.

2452
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000

Sometimelike the flu.fer from

2465
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,000
With aches, fever and chills-
the flu's a really big deal.

2466
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,000
So why treat it like
it's a little cold?

2467
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
There's something
that works differently

2468
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
than over-the-counter
remedies.

2469
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Prescription TAMIFLU attacks
the flu virus at its source.

2470
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
So don't wait. Call your
doctor right away.

2471
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
TAMIFLU is prescription
medicine for treating the flu

whose flu symptoms started
within the last two days.

2474
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Before taking TAMIFLU tell your

health conditions,

2476

or take other medicines.

2477
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
If you develop an allergic
reaction, a severe rash,

2478
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
or signs of unusual behavior,

2479
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,000
stop taking TAMIFLU and call
your doctor immediately.

2480
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Children and adolescents in
particular may be at an

2481
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
increased risk
of seizures, confusion

2482

or abnormal behavior.

2483
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
The most common
side effects are

mild to moderate nausea
and vomiting.

The flu comes on fast,

2486
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
so ask your
doctor about TAMIFLU.

2487
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,000
