there was the Cube.

where it comes from,

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay? I got the 2,000
and I got two As.

172
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Okay? Here's the dream.
Your B-. Pfft!
Dream gone. Kaput.

173
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?

174
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes! Yes, yes.

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So?

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
A-. It's an A, though.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Wait, wait, wait.
I can't see. It's an A.

178

So I'm good?
You're good.

I got a little surprise
for you, son.

180
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What kind of...

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, a little surprise.

182

Yeah. I am.

You think that's funny?
Yeah, I think it's funny.

187
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What's wrong with you?
You think I'd really get you

188
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
a Porsche for your first car?

189
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest
of this whole thing.

190
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
(LAUGHING) Oh, come on.
It's just a practical joke.

191
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's not a funny joke.

193
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.

a heat stroke again.

It hurts my eyes.

Here? No, no, no,
what is this?

You said half a car,
not half a piece of crap, Dad.

198

When I was your age,
I'd have been happy with
four wheels and an engine.

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Okay, let me explain
something to you. Okay?

You ever see
40-Year-Old Virgin?
Yeah.

201

Okay, that's what this is.

202
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And this is
50-year-old virgin.

203
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Okay.
You want me to live that life?

204

No sacrifice, no victory.
Yeah, no victory.

Right.

looking to buy his first car.

Let me tell you
something, son.

217
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
(ENGINE REVVING)
A driver don't pick the car.

218
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The car'll pick the driver.

219
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.

220
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Son, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them.

in front of my mammy.

That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!

(GROANS) Well,

238
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
considering the semi-classic
nature of the vehicle,

239
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...

240
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
SAM: Yeah,
but the paint's faded.

241
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah, but it's custom.
It's custom faded?

242
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Well, this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

243

Five grand.

244

No, I'm not paying
over four. Sorry.

Kid, come on, get out.
Get out the car.

246
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
No, no, no. You said
cars pick their drivers.

247
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Well, sometimes
they pick a driver

248
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
with a cheap-ass father.
Out the car.

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Now, this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.

250
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
There's a Fiesta with
racing stripes over there.

251
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
No, I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.

Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here,

278
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
so these are the facts.

At 1900 local time yesterday,

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000

Base in Qatar was attacked.

281
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So far as we know,
there were no survivors.

282
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The objective of the attack
was to hack
our military network.

283
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
We're not sure exactly
what they're after,

284
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
but we do know that they were
cut off during the assault,

285
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
which would lead us to assume
that they're going
to try it again.

286
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Now, no one's taken
responsibility for the attack.

287
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And the only real lead
we have so far is this sound.

678

679
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000

All right! Oh! No! No!

680
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Okay. Please,
please don't kill me!

681

I don't want them!
Car's yours!

682

Listen, listen, listen.

683
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Good, you're here.
Let me see your hands!

684
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
No, no, no! It's not me!
Let me see your hands.

685
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
The guy's inside.

686
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Shut up!
Walk towards the car.

687
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Put your head
on the hood.

688
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Whoever did this finally
managed to infiltrate
our defense network,

689
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
which is what they
tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked.

690
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
What did they get?
We still don't know.

691
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Talk to me
about the virus.

692
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
It's a Spider-bot virus.

693
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
We're not sure
what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system.

694
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
KELLER: Can we stop it?
Every time
we try an antivirus,

695
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
it adapts and speeds up. It's
like it's not a virus anymore.
It's become the system.

696
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
BRIGHAM: Obviously
the first phase of a major
attack against the US.

697
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
The only countries
with this kind of capability

698
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
are Russia, North Korea,
maybe China.

699
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm sorry,
that's not correct.

700
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Excuse me, young lady.
I didn't see you standing
there. You would be who?

701
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.

702
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Hold on. It was you?
You did it?

703
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Her team.
Sir, I was just
trying to say,

704
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
they hacked your firewall
in 10 seconds.

705
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack

706
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
would take 20 years
to do that.

707
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Maybe you can explain, then,
how our latest
satellite imagery

708
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.

709
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that
what we're doing?

710
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
The signal pattern
is learning.

711
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It's evolving on its own.

712
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And you need to move
past Fourier transfers

713
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
and start considering
quantum mechanics.

714
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
There is nothing on Earth
that complex.

715
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
What about an organism?
A living organism?

716
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?

717
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And I know that
that sounds crazy...

718
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
That's enough.
That's enough.

719
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
We have six floors of analysts
working on this thing.

720
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Now, if you can find proof
to back up your theory,

721
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I'm gonna be happy
to listen to you.

722
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
But if you don't get a filter
on that brain-mouth thing,

723
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
you're gonna be off the team.
You understand?

724
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Look, I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear
I am being.

725
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000

726
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000

Autobots, recon.

1351

RON: I hope he's okay.
He's in the kitchen.

1352
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Got some ice on his nose.

1353
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I had to slap him
around a little bit.

1354
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
You did not.

1355
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
You didn't even
ground him.
Almost, almost.

1356
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Where are they?
No, no, no, no, no.

1357

Come on, come on.

want those glasses.

What are you doing?

I'm gonna help you.
Okay.

Please hurry.
SAM: Okay.

1363
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Yeah, no, no.
It's definitely gone.
What do you mean?

1364
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
My glasses
were in the bag.

1365
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.

1366
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?

1367
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
So what I think you should do
is you should...

1368
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
You should check this whole...
This whole section here.

1369
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Just give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.

Yeah, no, no, no.
Not there. That's my...
That's my private...

1371

Sorry. That's nothing.
You just...
You just told me to look...

1372
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I know, but I didn't
mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

1373

MIKAELA: You should be way
more specific so I don't get
in trouble in your room.

1374

stressed out enough.

SAM: Okay. What now?

1376
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
No. No, no. No, no, no.

1377

This isn't hiding.
This isn't hiding.

1378
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
This is my backyard,
not a truck stop.
Oh, God. Oh!

1379
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed
right here and now it's gone.

1380
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,000

Who's gonna pay for that?

1382

I can't deal with this.
I can't...

1383

Oops.

Okay, listen.
You got to listen to me.

1386

come out here and see you,
they're gonna freak out.

got a temper, okay?

1388

I've been looking everywhere.

They're not here.
They're definitely not here.

Keep searching.

1392

I need you to be quiet
for five minutes.

SAM: Listen, we got
a major issue in here.

1415

You gotta stop the light.

There's no light, Dad!
There's no light!

02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,000
But it won't do us much good

2011
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,000
if we can't get
world communications back up.

2012
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Hey, kid.

2013
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,000
I think we got off
to a bad start, huh?

2014
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,000
You must be hungry?

2015
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?

2016
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Where's my car?

2017
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Son, I need you to
listen to me very carefully.

2018
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
People can die here.

2019
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,000
We need to know
everything you know.

2020
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
We need to know it now.

2021
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Okay.

2022
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
But first, I'll take my car,
my parents.

2023
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Maybe you should
write that down.

2024
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone.

2025
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Like, forever.

2026
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.

2027
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Thank you.

2028
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:31,000
The man's an extortionist.

2029
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,000
SIMMONS: All right,
here's the situation.

2030
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

2031
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
NBEs?

2032
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Non-Biological
Extraterrestrials.

2033
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Try and keep up
with the acronyms.

2034
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:44,000
What you're about to see
is totally classified.

2035
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Dear God. What is this?

2036
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,000
BANACHEK: We think when
he made his approach
over the north pole,

2037
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,000
our gravitational field
screwed up his telemetry.

2038
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:07,000
He crashed in the ice,
probably a few
thousand years ago.

2039
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:10,000
We shipped him here
to this facility in 1934.

2040
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
SIMMONS: We call him NBE One.

2041
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
SAM: Well, sir, I don't mean
to correct you on everything
you think you know,

2042
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:19,000
but, I mean,
that's Megatron.

2043
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,000
He's the leader
of the Decepticons.

2044
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,000
He's been in cryostasis
since 1935.

2045
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Your great-great-grandfather

2046
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:28,000
made one of
the greatest discoveries

2047
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,000
in the history of mankind.

2048
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,

2049
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,000
the microchip, lasers,
spaceflight, cars,

2050
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:39,000
all reverse-engineered
by studying him.

2051
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:43,000
NBE One.
That's what we call it.

2052
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,000
And you didn't think
the United States military
might need to know

2053
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:49,000
that you're keeping
a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?

2054
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Until these events,
we had no credible threat
to national security.

2055
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Well, you got one now.

2056
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
So why Earth?
SAM: It's the All Spark.

2057
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
All Spark? What is that?

2058
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Well, yeah, they came here
looking for some sort of
cube-looking thing.

2059
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here,
AKA Megatron,

2060
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,000
that's what they call him,

2061
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,000
who's pretty much
the harbinger of death,
wants to use the Cube

2062
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:13,000
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.

2063
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
That's their plan.

2064
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,000
And you're sure about that?

2065
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Yeah.

2066
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:23,000
You guys know
where it is, don't you?

2067
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Follow me.

2068
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:33,000
SIMMONS: You're about to see
our crown jewel.

2069
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:44,000
TOM: Carbon dating
puts the Cube here
around 10,000 BC.

2070
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:48,000
The first Seven
didn't find it until 1913.

2071
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:52,000
They knew it was alien
because of the matching
hieroglyphics on the Cube

2072
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
as well as NBE One.

2073
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
President Hoover had
the dam built around it.

2074
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Four football fields
thick of concrete.

2075
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,000
A perfect way to hide
its energy from being
detected by anyone

2076
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:07,000
or any alien species
on the outside.

2077
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:18,000
(IN ALIEN LANGUAGE)

2078
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Wait, back up.
You said the dam
hides the Cube's energy.

2079
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
What kind exactly?

2080
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:56,000
TOM: Good question.

2081
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.

2082
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Oh, wow.

2083
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
What's that? Freddy Krueger
done been up in here
or something?

2084
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Oh, no, man.

2085
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Freddy Krueger
have four blades, man.

2086
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,000
(SNARLS)
That's only three.
That's Wolverine!

2087
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Right? That's Wolverine!

2088
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,000
That's very funny.

2089
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Anybody have any
mechanical devices?

2090
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
BlackBerry? Key alarm?
Cell phone?

2091
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:28,000
I got a phone.

2092

SIMMONS: We're able to take
the Cube radiation

2093
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:44,000
and funnel it into that box.

2094
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Mean little sucker, huh?

2095
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
That thing is freaky!

2096
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny
from hell, huh?

2098

the Cube is here.

Banachek. What's going on?

2125
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Well, the NBE One hangar
has lost power...

2126
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,000
What?
...and the backup generator

2127
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:46,000
is just not gonna cut it.
Do you have an arms room?

2128

with the Cube.

on the kid's Camaro?

about them.

02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
EPPS: Target marked.
Still waiting.

2518
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:21,000
PILOT: Time on target,
20 seconds.

2519
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:29,000
F-22s, we're still waiting.

2520
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Move out!

2521
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:42,000
Incoming!

2522
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:51,000
PILOT: Weapons armed.
Status green.

2523
02:50:56,000 --> 02:51:01,000
(YELLING)

2524
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:12,000
Run! Move!

2525
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:17,000
(GRUNTING)

2526
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Second wave's on approach.

2527
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:23,000
What is that? Break off!

2528
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Copy.
It's either a massive
amount of...

2529
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:40,000
Two, get a lock!
Pop that guy!

2530
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
Stay on him.
Keep him in your sights.

2531
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Take him out!

2532
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:04,000
Two's down!

2533
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
I'll kill you!

2534
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:15,000
Mine! All Spark!

2535
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:19,000
Sam! Put the Cube
in my chest! Now!

2536
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Sam!

2537
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:26,000
No, Sam!

2538
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Hold up.

2539
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:57,000
OPTIMUS: You left me
no choice, brother.

2540
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:09,000
Sam, I owe you my life.

2541
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:14,000
We are in your debt.

2542
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:33,000
Prime, we couldn't save him.

2543
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:38,000
Aw, Jazz.

2544
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:41,000
We lost a great comrade

2545
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:44,000
but gained new ones.

2546
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
Thank you, all of you.

2547
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:50,000
You honor us
with your bravery.

2548
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
Permission to speak, sir?

2549
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:55,000
Permission granted,
old friend.

2550
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
You speak now?

2551
02:53:57,000 --> 02:54:00,000
I wish to stay with the boy.

2552
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:05,000
If that is his choice.

2553
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:12,000
Yes.

2554
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Gentlemen, the President
has ordered Sector Seven
be terminated

2555
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:38,000
and the remains of the
dead aliens disposed of.

2556
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:41,000
The Laurentian Abyss is
seven miles below sea level,

2557
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
deepest place on our planet.

2558
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
The massive depth
and pressure there,

2559
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
coupled with
subfreezing temperatures,

2560
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:51,000
would crush and entomb them,

2561
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:56,000
leaving no evidence.

2562
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
OPTIMUS:
With the All Spark gone,

2563
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:06,000
we cannot return
life to our planet.

2564
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:10,000
And fate has
yielded its reward,

2565
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:15,000
a new world to call home.

2566
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:23,000
We live among its people now,
hiding in plain sight,

2567
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:26,000
but watching over them
in secret,

2568
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:30,000
waiting, protecting.

2569
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:34,000
I have witnessed
their capacity for courage.

2570
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:37,000
And though
we are worlds apart,

2571
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:42,000
like us, there's more to them
than meets the eye.

2572
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:46,000
I am Optimus Prime

2573
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:50,000
and I send this message
to any surviving Autobots

2574
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:54,000
taking refuge among the stars.

2575
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
We are here.

2576
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
We are waiting.
