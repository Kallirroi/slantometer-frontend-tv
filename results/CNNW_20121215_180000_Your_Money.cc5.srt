1
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
>>> GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'M DON LEMON AND YOU'RE

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
WATCHING LIVE SPECIAL COVERAGE

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
FROM NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, THE

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
SCENE OF THE HORRIFIC ELEMENTARY

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
SCHOOL RAMPAGE.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
>> AND I'M DEBORAH FEYERICK HERE

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
LIVE IN ATLANTA.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
>> I WANT TO TELL YOU, VIEWERS,

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
THIS IS HARD AND OVER THE NEXT
TWO HOURS KNOW THAT WE ARE DOING

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY HARD AND

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
UNPRECEDENTED, NOT DEALING WITH

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
WHAT THE FAMILIES ARE DEALING

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
WITH, OBVIOUSLY, WHO HAVE

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
SUFFERED SUCH TRAGEDY BUT TO

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
HAVE TO COME AND REPORT ON 20

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
CHILDREN DEAD IS ALMOST UNFATE

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
TH

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
UNFATHOMABLE.
THE CHURCH IS KEEPING THEIR

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
DOORS OPEN AND ARE NOT ALLOWING

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
THE MEDIA TO COME IN HERE.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
THIS SEARCH IS OPEN FOR 24

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
HOURS.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
THEY HAVE LOST MEMBERS OF THEIR

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
OWN CHURCH.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
AGAIN, THIS IS HARD.
I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF AND DEB

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
FEYERICK, WE WILL TRY TO SPEAK

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
AS CALM AND COMFORTING AS WE CAN

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
AND SOMETIMES WE WON'T GET

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
THINGS RIGHT.
WE'RE LEARNING A LOT OF

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
INFORMATION JUST AS YOU ARE
LEARNING IT HERE.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
WE'RE GOING TO BE TRY TO BE AS

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
RESPECTFUL AS POSSIBLE.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
WE DID NOT SPEAK WITH CHILDREN

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
ON CAMERA WITHOUT THE PARENTS'

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
PERMISSION.
AS WE SAY THAT, BEAR WITH US

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
GO THROUGH THIS WITHOUT BREAKING
DOWN.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
THIS IS REALLY TOUGH FOR
EVERYONE INVOLVED AND FOR

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
EVERYONE WATCHING.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
SO WE'RE LEARNING NEW DETAILS

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
ABOUT HOW THIS RAMPAGE UNFOLDED

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
AND THAT MAN, WHO IS ACCUSED OF

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
CARRYING IT OUT.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
HE IS 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA AND

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
WE WILL TRY TO SAY HIS NAME AS

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
LITTLE AS POSSIBLE BUT WE HAVE

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
TO SAY IT FOR THE RECORD.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
LANZA TRIED TO BUY A GUN THREE

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
DAYS BEFORE THE SHOOTING BUT DID
NOT HAVE THE PROPER PAPERWORK.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
AND POLICE REVEALED JUST TODAY

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
THAT THREE GUNS, NOT TWO, AS

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT WERE FOUND

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
NEAR LANZA'S BODY INSIDE THAT

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
SCHOOL.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE WORKING AROUND

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
THE CLOCK AND WILL PROBABLY BE

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
THERE FOR ANOTHER DAY OR TWO

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
UNTIL THEY GET ALL OF THE

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
INFORMATION THEY NEED.
THE VICTIMS' BODIES HAVE BEEN

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
REMOVED FROM THE SCHOOL AND

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
TAKEN TO THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S
OFFICE.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
NOT JUST VICTIMS BUT PEOPLE WHO
LIVED EXTRAORDINARY LIVES.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
THEIR NAMES ARE EXPECTED TO BE

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
RELEASED SOON.
AND WHEN WE GET THEM WE WILL

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
REVEAL THEM TO YOU AS RESPECTFUL

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
AS POSSIBLE.
WE'RE LEFT WITH MORE QUESTIONS

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
THAN ANSWERS ABOUT THE POSSIBLE

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
MOTIVE OF THIS 20-YEAR-OLD

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
SHOOTER.
POLICE SAY HE KILLED HIS MOTHER.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
HIS MOTHER'S NAME IS NANCY.
HE DID THAT AT HER HOME IN

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
NEWTOWN BEFORE THE RAMPAGE AT

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
SCHOOL AND THEN TOOK HIS OWN

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
LIVE.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
MARY SNOW IS LIVE.

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
THIS IS TOUGH.

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED ABOUT THIS

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
SUSPECT?

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
ARE WE LEARNING ANYTHING ABOUT A

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
MOTIVE AT THIS HOUR?

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
>> Reporter: WELL, DON,
OFFICIALS AREN'T SAYING PUBLICLY

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING ABOUT A

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
MOTIVE BUT THEY ARE PICKING UP

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW AND WHY

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
THIS HORRIC SHOOTING HAPPENED

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
AND THEY HAVE BEEN RECOVERING
EVIDENCE AND WE JUST SAW A TRUCK

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
BELONGING TO THE CONNECTICUT

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
STATE POLICE JUST LEAVING THE

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
LANZA HOME THAT IS BEHIND ME.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
YOU CAN'T SEE IT.

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
IT'S BEHIND ME AT THE BACK.

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
SEVERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
LEFT JUST MOMENTS AGO AND LAW

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN ON THIS

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
SCENE SINCE SHORTLY AFTER

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
YESTERDAY'S HORRIFIC SHOOTING.

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
EARLIER THIS MORNING LIEUTENANT

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
PAUL VANCE WAS ASKED WHETHER

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
WRITINGS OR E-MAILS WERE

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
RECOVERED TO TELL INVESTIGATORS

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
ABOUT A POTENTIAL MOTIVE.
HERE'S HOW HE ANSWERED THAT

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
QUESTION.
>> OUR INVESTIGATORS AT THE

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
CRIME SCENE, THE SCHOOL AND

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
SECONDARILY AT THE SECONDARY

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
CRIME SCENE THAT WE DISCUSSED
WHERE THE FEMALE WAS LOCATED

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
DECEASED, DID PRODUCE SOME VERY

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
GOOD EVIDENCE IN THIS

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
INVESTIGATION THAT OUR

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
INVESTIGATORS WILL BE ABLE TO
USE IN HOPEFULLY PAINTING THE

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
COMPLETE PICTURE ABOUT HOW AND

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
WHY THIS OCCURRED.
>> Reporter: DON, YOU WERE JUST

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
REPORTING ON THE WEAPONS THAT

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
WERE FOUND YESTERDAY NEAR THE
SHOOTER'S BODY.

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
CNN -- THOSE TWO WEAPONS, TWO

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
HANDGUNS AND ONE SEMIAUTOMATIC

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
RIFLE AND CNN HAS BEEN REPORTING

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
THAT THE WEAPONS HAD BEEN

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
PURCHASED BY THE SUSPECT'S

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
MOTHER, NANCY LANZA.

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
NANCY LANZA, DON'T KNOW MUCH

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
ABOUT HER.

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
WE DID TALK TO A NEIGHBOR

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
EARLIER TODAY WHO SAID, BE YOU

124
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
KNOW, THERE WAS NOTHING OUT OF

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
THE ORDINARY ABOUT THIS WOMAN,

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
THAT SHE WAS A NICE WOMAN.

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
SHE WAS KNOWN AROUND THE

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.
BUT SAID THAT THE FAMILY WASN'T

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
ALL THAT SOCIAL BUT THERE WAS

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
REALLY NOTHING OUT OF THE
ORDINARY AND CAME AS A SURPRISE

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
TO LEARN ABOUT THOSE WEAPONS,

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
OBVIOUSLY.

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
DON?
>> SO MARY, AS WE ARE LEARNING,

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
ONE WAS A GLOCK, ONE WAS A SIG

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
SAUER AND ONE WAS A BUSHMASTER

136
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
AND WE UNDERSTAND HE TRIED TO

137
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
PURCHASE OTHER GUNS BUT THERE

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE PAPERWORK?

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
>> Reporter: CNN'S SUSAN

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
CANDIOTTI HAD BEEN REPORTING
ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE HAD

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
ACCESS TO OTHER WEAPONS AND THAT

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
THERE HAD BEEN, I BELIEVE, THREE

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
OTHER WEAPONS WERE RECOVERED

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
ELSEWHERE.

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
>> AND YOU LOOK AT THOSE GUNS ON

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
THE SCREEN.
MARY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
YOU WONDER HOW A 20-YEAR-OLD WHO

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
MAY HAVE HAD ISSUES WOULD GAIN
ACCESS TO THOSE GUNS AND EVERY

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
TIME WE HAVE A SHOOTING I JUST

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
CAME BACK FROM COLORADO IT SEEMS

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
LIKE WEEKS AGO REPORTING ON THAT

152
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
THEATER SHOOTING.
WHEN IS THE TIME, MARY?

153
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
WHEN IS THE TIME?

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE AROUND THE

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
COUNTRY IS WONDERING.
THANK YOU, MARY SNOW.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
DEB FEYERICK IS BACK IN ATLANTA
WHERE WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THE VICTIMS.

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
DEB?
>> ONE THING TO CONTINUE ON YOUR

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
TRAIN OF THOUGHT, THE THREE GUNS

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
THAT WERE FOUND, THREE OF THEM

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
WERE PURCHASED LEGALLY BY THE
MOTHER, NANCY LANZA.

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
THE QUESTION IS, WHY DID SHE

163
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
HAVE THESE PARTICULAR TYPE OF
GUNS WHICH ARE DEFENSIVE.

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THESE ARE NOT HUNTING RIFLES.

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
THESE ARE GUNS THAT YOU KEEP FOR

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
PROTECTION.
CLEARLY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
THEY ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
INTO.

169
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT THE NAMES

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
OF THE VICTIMS OF THIS HORRIFIC

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
ATTACK.
20 CHILDREN.
THEY WERE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 5

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
AND 10 YEARS OLD, FROM

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
KINDERGARTEN UP TO 3rd AND 4th

174
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
GREAT.
SIX ADULTS KILLED, AMONG THE

175
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
SCHOOL'S PRINCIPAL AND SCHOOL

176
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
PSYCHOLOGIST.

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
NICK VALENCIA IS JOINING ME AS

178
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
HE IS LEARNING MORE ABOUT WHO

179
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
THE VICTIMS ARE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

180
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
WE'RE WAITING FOR A CONFIRMATION

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
FROM STATE POLICE.
26 PEOPLE IN ALL KILLED AT THE

182
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
YESTERDAY.
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRM TWO OF

185
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
THOSE NAMES, DEB.

186
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
ONE IS DAWN HOCHSPRUNG, THE

187
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
BELOVED PRINCIPAL.

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
JUST 47 YEARS OLD.

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
SHE HAD BEEN THE PRINCIPAL SINCE

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
2010.

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
DESCRIBED BY PEOPLE WHO KNEW HER

192
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
AS AFFABLE BUT SERIOUS LEADER.

193
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
A TOUGH LADY BUT IN THE RIGHT

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
SORT OF SENSE.
SHE HAD ARRIVED WITH 12 YEARS OF

195
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
ADMINISTRATIVE SPERN.
SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL SMILE.

196
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
SHE OVERSAW THE SCHOOL SECURITY

197
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
PROJECT WHICH REQUIRED EVERYBODY
THAT VISITED THE SCHOOL AFTER

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
9:30 A.M., THEY WERE REQUIRED TO

199
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
BUZZ IN AT THAT FRONT ENTRANCE.

200
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
WE UNDERSTAND THAT DETAILS HAVE

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
EMERGED THAT THE GUNMAN STORMED

202
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
IN, FORCED HIS WAY IN TO SANDY

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

204
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
SHE WAS -- GETTING BA BEING ACK

205
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
THE VICTIM, DAWN HOCHSPRUNG, SHE

206
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
LEAVES BEHIND A HUSBAND AND TWO

207
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
DAUGHTERS AND THREE

208
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
STEPDAUGHTERS.

209
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
MARY SHERLACH, THE SCHOOL

210
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
PSYCHOLOGIST, SHE SPENT A LOT OF
TIME IN THREE SCHOOL SYSTEMS

211
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
BEFORE ARRIVING AT SANDY HOOK

212
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
ELEMENT VEE SCHOOL.
ON FRIDAY, A PARENT TOLD CNN

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
THAT SHERLACH AND HOCHSPRUNG

214
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
WERE IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE

215
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
MEETING AT WHICH POINT THEY

216
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
HEARD A LARGE POP, POP, POP
WHICH WE NOW UNDERSTAND WAS THE

217
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
GUNFIRE COMING FROM THE

218
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
SUSPECTED GUNMAN AT WHICH POINT
THEY LEFT INTO THE HALLWAY AND

219
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
THEY WERE CONFRONTED BY THE

220
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
GUNMAN.
THEY LEFT TO INVESTIGATE BUT

221
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
BOTH NEVER CAME BACK.

222
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THE PSYCHOLOGIST, MARY SHERLACH,

223
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
HAD A MASTER'S DEGREE FROM

224
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
SOUTHERN STATE CONNECTICUT.

225
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
SHE WORKED WITH DISABLED ADULTS.

226
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
A QUINTESSENTIAL IN THAT FABRIC

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
OF THE COMMUNITY THERE.

228
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
A SAD, SAD SITUATION.
THE 26 VICTIMS, TWO NAMES WE'VE

229
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM SO FAR.

230
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
WE'LL UNDOUBTEDLY HEAR MORE

231
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
ABOUT THE VICTIMS.

232
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
AND KATE BOLDUAN REPORTED THAT A

234
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
TEACHER WAS ABLE TO PROTECT HER

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
CHILDREN AND THEY RAN OUT PAST

236
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
THE GUNMAN.

237
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER IN FACT

238
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
SHE SURVIVED THIS ATTACK.

239
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
HER SISTER POSTED SOMETHING ON

240
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
HER TWITTER ACCOUNT SAYING MY

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
SISTER DIED PROTECTING HER

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
STUDENTS.
GOD, WHY DID YOU TAKE HER?

243
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
AND DON I THINK THAT IS THE
QUESTION THAT SO MANY ARE

244
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
REQUESTING NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT

245
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
THE FACES AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE

246
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
SO MANY OTHER FACES.
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS AND

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
YOU THINK OF THE VULNERABILITY

248
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
AND HOW ONE MOMENT YOU ARE HAPPY

249
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
AND YOUR LIFE IS IN TACT AND

250
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S ALMOST
AS IF YOU TAKE A TURN AND YOU GO

251
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
DOWN ANOTHER PATH AND I THINK

252
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
THAT IS A QUESTION THAT EVERYONE

253
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
IS GOING TO ASK AND THAT IS,

254
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
GOD, WHY DID YOU TAKE THEM?

255
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
DON?
>> WE KEEP CALLING THEM VICTIMS.

256
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVED
EXTRAORDINARY LIVES AND IF

257
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
YOU'VE HEARD THEIR STORY, YOU'VE

258
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
HEARD HOW THEY HANDLE ALL OF

259
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
THIS EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE WHO

260
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
DID THE BEST THAT THEY COULD

261
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND

262
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'M SURE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THEIR

263
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
LIVES AND I WOULD NOT LIKE TO

264
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
TROEFR THEM AS VICTIMS.

265
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
JUST PEOPLE WHO LIVED

266
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
EXTRAORDINARY LIVES AND TAKEN

267
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
AWAY TOO SOON.

268
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
THANK YOU, DEB.
>>> NEW INFORMATION JUST IN TO

269
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
CNN, THE GOVERNOR DANNEL MALLOY,

270
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
THE GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT,

271
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
WILL ADDRESS THE PEOPLE OF

272
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
CONNECTICUT AT 5:00 P.M.

273
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
EASTERN.

274
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
HE WILL SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE OF

275
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
CONNECTICUT LIVE FROM HIS

276
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
OFFICE.
IT GOES ON TO SAY HOW WE'RE

277
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
GOING TO GET THE INFORMATION.

278
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
EXPECT THAT AND WE'LL CARRY IT

279
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
LIVE FOR YOU HERE IN CNN.
IN THE MEANTIME, INVESTIGATORS

280
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
SAY THAT THE SCHOOL SHOOTER HAD

281
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
SOME SORT OF ALTERCATION AT THE

282
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
SCHOOL EARLIER IN THE WEEK AND

283
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
POLICE NOW SAY TWO PISTOLS AND
AN ASSAULT RIFLE WERE FOUND

284
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
INSIDE THE SCHOOL NEAR HIS BODY.

285
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
NO ONE, ESPECIALLY LITTLE KIDS,

286
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
ESPECIALLY LITTLE KIDS -- THINK

287
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
ABOUT THE AGE OF THESE CHILDREN.

288
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
NO ONE STANDS A CHANCE AGAINST
SUCH FIRE POWER.

289
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I WANT TO BRING IN CNN
CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER CIA

290
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
DIRECTOR TOM FUENTES.

291
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
BEFORE WE GET TO THAT

292
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
CONVERSATION, LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE CONVERSATION THAT PEOPLE ARE

293
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
HAVING IN THE COUNTRY WHEN IT

294
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
COMES TO GUN LAWS AND THE SECOND
AMENDMENT RIGHT.

295
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
NO ONE IS TRYING TO TAKE AWAY

296
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
THE SECOND AMOUNT RIGHT.

297
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
AS A TAX DEE DRIVER DROVE ME TO

298
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
MY HOTEL AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING,

299
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
THE TAXI DRIVER SAID, WHAT IS
CONGRESS DOING ABOUT GUN LAWS?

300
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
IT'S TIME TO ACT NOW AND STOP

301
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
SAYING IT'S NOT RESPONSIBLE TO

302
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
TALK ABOUT IT AFTER A SHOOTING.

303
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
THIS IS THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT

304
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
IT.
>> DON, I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH

305
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
YOU.

306
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
WE HEAR WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS

307
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
NOW, WE HAVE TO BE IN MOURNING

308
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
AND PRAY FOR THE FAMILIES AND

309
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
THEN A COUPLE DAYS GO BY, THE
EMOTION GOES BY AND NOBODY CARES

310
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

311
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
SO YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHEN IS THE TIME?

312
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
THERE'S NO GOOD TIME.
NO BETTER TIME THAN THE PRESENT,

313
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I THINK, TO HAVE AT LEAST HAVE

314
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
THE DISCUSSION OF WHAT IS

315
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
REASONABLE FOR THE NUMBER OF

316
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
FIREARMS THAT ARE AT LARGE IN
SOCIETY AND NOT TO MENTION THAT

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
WE STILL HAVE THE ISSUE OF THE

318
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
VERY INADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH
SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY.

319
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
SO IF YOU'RE A PARENT AND HAVE A

320
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
CHILD THAT IS GROWING UP WITH
PROBLEMS AND YOU CAN SEE THAT

321
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
THEY HAVE SOME TYPE OF A BRAIN
DISORDER OR MENTAL ISSUE,

322
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT YOU CAN DO

323
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
ABOUT IT.
THERE'S NOT MUCH HELP THAT

324
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
SOCIETY GIVES A FAMILY OR LAW

325
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
ENFORCEMENT OR DOCTORS TO DEAL

326
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
WITH MENTALLY DISTURBED
INDIVIDUALS AND THEN COMBINE

327
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
THAT WITH THE NUMBER OF WEAPONS

328
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
AT LARGE AND WE HAVE DISASTER
AFTER DISASTER.

329
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
WE'RE ALL UPSET, SHOCKED AND

330
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
OUTRAGED.
A COUPLE DAYS GO BY AND NOTHING

331
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
CHANGES.

332
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
>> WELL, LISTEN, I THINK YOU'RE
RIGHT ABOUT THAT WHEN IT COMES

333
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
TO THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE.

334
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
HERE'S THE THING.
IF SOMEONE HAS A MENTAL HEALTH

335
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
PROBLEM, THREE OTHER PEOPLE, TEN

336
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
OTHER PEOPLE CAN TAKE THEM DOWN.

337
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
IF SOMEONE WITH A KNIFE DOES THE
SAME THING, THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN

338
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
WITH A GUN.
YOU HAVE THE POWER WITH AN

339
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
AUTOMATIC WEAPON TO TAKE AWAY

340
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
MANY, MANY LIVES IN A SPLIT
SECOND AND THAT NEEDS TO BE

341
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
ADDRESSED, EVEN IF YOU ARE

342
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
MENTALLY HEALTHY OR MENTALLY

343
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
UNHEALTHY.
GUNS DO OFFER YOU THAT POWER.

344
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
>> WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

345
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
BUT IN THIS CASE, EVEN MORE

346
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
POWER BECAUSE --
>> AND IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS

347
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
TO THOSE GUNS, MENTALLY STABLE

348
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
OR MENTALLY UNSTABLE, THEN

349
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE

350
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
SO MANY LIVES AT ONCE.

351
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
>> WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

352
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
AND IN A CASE LIKE THIS, THOUGH,

353
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
WHERE THE SHOOTER STOPS AND
RELOADS, UNDOUBTEDLY TO FIRE AS

354
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
MANY BULLETS AS HE DID, HE WOULD

355
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
HAVE HAD TO RELOAD SEVERAL
TIMES.

356
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
WHO IS GOING TO ATTACK HIM OR

357
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
JUMP ON HIM?
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A

358
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
5-YEAR-OLD SAY, LET'S ROLL AND

359
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
TAKE THE GUN AWAY FROM THE

360
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
SHOOTER.
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
THEY ARE GOING TO SIT THERE OR

361
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
STAND THERE OR RUN THERE AND BE

362
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
KILLED AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE

363
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
IN THIS CASE.

364
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
>> OKAY.

365
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
SO LISTEN, NOW WE'RE LEARNING
THAT THE GUNMAN MAY HAVE HAD

366
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
ACCESS TO THREE ADDITIONAL

367
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
RIFLES.
HE TRIED TO BUY A GUN AS EARLY

368
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
AS TUESDAY.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT.

369
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
>> WELL, THAT'S INTERESTING.

370
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HIS BRAIN

371
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
THAT HE DIDN'T THINK THE THREE

372
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
WEAPONS THAT HE SHOWED UP WITH

373
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
WERE ENOUGH?

374
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
A BLOCK, A SIG SAUER PISTOL, BE

375
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
TREMENDOUS FIREPOWER AND THEN

376
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
COMBINING THAT WITH AN ASSAULT

377
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
RIFLE WHERE HE CAN BUY A
30-ROUND OR GREATER MAGAZINE TO

378
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
FEED THROUGH THAT GUN?

379
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
THAT WASN'T ENOUGH?

380
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
WHAT DID HE HAVE IN MIND?

381
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
TAKE OUT THE WHOLE SCHOOL?

382
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
WE DON'T KNOW.

383
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
>> WHY ARE INVESTIGATORS SO

384
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
INTENT ON RECITING THE CRIME

385
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END?
IS IT LIKELY THAT THEY WILL

386
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
DISCOVER SOMETHING NEW?
>> IT'S POSSIBLE AND THEN ALSO

387
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
IN DOING HIS BACKGROUND CHECK

388
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
THEY MAY FIND THAT THERE MAY BE

389
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
SOME OTHER INDIVIDUAL OUT THERE

390
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
THAT TRIGGERED THIS AND WE DON'T

391
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
KNOW, NOT NECESSARILY A

392
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
CO-CONSPIRATOR BUT SOMEBODY OUT

393
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
THERE THAT MAY HAVE KNOWLEDGE

394
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
ABOUT IT AND THEY ARE GOING TO

395
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
WANT TO KNOW IF HE HAD PAPERWORK

396
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
ON HIS BODY WHEN THEY FOUND HIM

397
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
IN THE SCHOOL, MAYBE HE WROTE

398
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
SOME KIND OF MAN GUEIFESTO, GOOE

399
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
LETTER.
NO CLUE WHAT WAS ON HIS MIND.

400
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
BUT THE AUTHORITIES WANT TO TALK

401
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
TO EVERYBODY THAT'S HAD A
CONVERSATION WITH HIM OR DEALT

402
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
WITH HIM GOING BACK AS FAR AS

403
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
THEY CAN, DAYS, MONTHS, YEARS

404
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
EVEN TO SEE IF THERE WAS

405
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
SOMETHING THAT SHOWED UP IN THE

406
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
PAST THAT WOULD BE AN INDICATION

407
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
OF WHAT TRIGGERED THIS, WHY HE

408
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
WANTED TO DO IT, FOR THE

409
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
PURPOSES OF TRYING TO IDENTIFY

410
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
THAT SAME ISSUE IN OTHER PEOPLE

411
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000

412

PROLIFERATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA,

427

443
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
BEAUTIFUL DAY THAT TURNS INTO

444
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
CARNAGE.
LET'S LOOK A STATEMENT THAT HE

445
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
HAS PUT INTO FACEBOOK.

446
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
HE SAYS, AS WE MOURN, WE MUST

447
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
SOUND A CALL FOR OUR LEADERS TO

448
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
STAND UP AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT.
THIS TIME OUR RESPONSE MUST

449
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
CONSIST OF MORE THAN REGRET,

450
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
SORROW, AND CONDOLENCE.

DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR GUN LAWS.

DISCUSSIONS AMONG PEOPLE YOU

KNOW AND AROUND THE COUNTRY AND

461
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
ON GUN LAWS AND AT THE SAME TIME

462
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
BEING DRIVEN BY A LOT OF PASSION
AND INTENSE EMOTIONS ABOUT WHAT

463

ANSWERS.

475
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
BUT WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT WE

476
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
NEED TO FIND SOME WAY TO COME
TOGETHER AROUND ALL VICTIMS OF

477
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
VIOLENCE, NOT JUST AT THE SANDY

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
CHILDREN FOREVER.

537
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
AND AS THE KIDS FROM SANDY HOOK

538
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AS THEY RUSH

539
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
INTO THE ARMS OF FRANTIC

540
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
PARENTS, MANY OF THEM RECALL THE

541
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
CHAOS AND THE FEAR THEY HAD

542
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
WITNESSED JUST A FEW MOMENTS

543
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
AGO.
OUR BRIAN TODD HAS THE DETAILS.

544
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
>> Reporter: THE ACCOUNT OF A

545
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
YOUNG BOY SAID TO BE DELIVERING

546
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
AN ATTENDANCE REPORT TO THE

547
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
OFFICE WHEN THE SHOOTINGS TOOK

548
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
PLACE IS SURREAL.
>> I SAW SOME OF THE BULLETS

549
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
GOING PAST THE HALL THAT I WAS

550
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
RIGHT NEXT TO AND THEN A TEACHER

551
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
PULLED ME INTO HER CLASSROOM.

SOUND LIKE SOMEONE KICKING A

DOOR.
HIS MOTHER, CLINGING TO HIM, HAD

555
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
WORDS OF THANKS.

556
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
>> I'M JUST SO GRATEFUL TO THE

557
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
TEACHER WHO SAVED HIM.

558
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
>> Reporter: YOU THINK THE

559
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
TEACHER SAVED HIS LIFE?

560
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
>> HE DEFINITELY DID.

561
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
HE HAD BULLETS GOING BY HIM AND

562
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
SHE GRABBED HIM AND OTHER CHILD
AND PULLED THEM INTO A QUESTION.

CHAOS.
>> I WAS IN THE GYM AT THE TIME.

00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
WE HEARD LIKE LOTS OF BANGS AND

567
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000

569
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000

AND SO WE -- WE WENT -- LIKE WE

571
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
WENT TO THE WALL AND WE SAT DOWN

572
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
AND THEN A POLICE CAME IN AND

573
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
SAID, IS HE IN HERE?

574
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
AND THEN HE RAN OUT AND THEN

SOMEBODY YELLED, GET TO A SAFE

576
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
PLACE.
SO WE WENT INTO THE CLOSET IN

578
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000

>> Reporter: CNN IS ONLY AIRING
SOUNDS OF CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS

584
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
GAVE THEM PERMISSION.

585
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
ONE WAS HEARD CRYING, WHY, WHY?

586
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
A POLICEMAN WAS HEARD SAYING IT

587
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
WAS THE WORST THING HE HAD SEEN
IN HIS CAREER.

588

593
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
WAITING FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO

594
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
COME OUT.

595
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE

596
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
STILL ALIVE.

597
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
THERE WERE 20 PARENTS THAT WERE

598
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
JUST TOLD THAT THEIR PARENTS

599
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
WERE DEAD.

600
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
IT WAS AWFUL.

TRYING TO PROCESS IT ALL.

604
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
>> IT WAS SHOCKING.

605
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I GOT THE CALL AT WORK THIS
MORNING AND I CAN'T BELIEVE A

606
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
SMALL TOWN LIKE THIS WOULD HAVE

607
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN AND

608
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
TO BE IN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IS
UNHEARD OF.

609
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
>> Reporter: BY LATE FRIDAY
MORNING AND INTO THE EVENING

610
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
EVACUATED CHILDREN WERE BEING

CARED FOR AND REUNITING WITH

612
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
THEIR PARENTS AT A NEARBY

613

FIREHOUSE.
BRIAN TODD, CNN, WASHINGTON.

614
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE

615
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
CHILDREN IN WHAT DO YOU SAY TO

616
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
THEM?

617
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
FIVE YEARS AGO THIS WAS THE

618
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
SCENE AT NEW LIFE CHURCH IN

619
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
COLORADO SPRINGS.

620
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
A GUNMAN OPENED FIRE DURING A

621
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
CHURCH SERVICE AND KILLED TWO
TEENAGE SISTERS.

622
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
IT IS SOMETHING THAT PASTOR BOYD

623
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
UNDERSTANDS.

624
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
HE'S THE AUTHOR OF "FEAR IN

625
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
EVIL," A TEST OF FAITH.

626
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
PASTOR BOYD, THANK YOU FOR

627
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
JOINING US ON REALLY THIS

628
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE TIME FOR THE

629
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
COUNTRY.
CAN YOU HEAL FROM THIS?

630
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
>> YES, YOU CAN.
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.

631
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
RIGHT NOW I CAN'T MANUAL.

632
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I HAVE TWO KIDS OF MY OWN.

633
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE PAIN THOSE

634
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
PARENTS ARE FEELING AND RIGHT

635
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
NOW THEY ARE NUMB AND WE HAVE

636
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
EXPERIENCED HEALING,

637
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
RESTORATION, WE'RE SMILING

638
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
AGAIN, LAUGHING AGAIN.

639
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
IT TAKES A REALLY LONG TIME.

640
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE PEOPLE

641
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
OF CONNECTICUT TO BE THERE FOR

642
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
THESE FAMILIES MONTHS FROM NOW,

643
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
YEARS FROM NOW.

644
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE FROM

645
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
NOW, MAYBE YEARS FOR THIS TOWN

646
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
TO COME BACK TO A SENSE OF
NORMALITY AND HEALING.

647
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
>> AND TIME HEALS -- I GUESS IT

648
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
HEALS ALL WOUNDS MAYBE BUT THE

649
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
CHURCH IN SANDY HOOK AND ELEMENT

650
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
MEA

651
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
MEANT TREE SCHOOL IS THE LAST

652
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
PLACE THAT YOU EXPECT THIS TO

653
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
HAPPEN.
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN A TRAGEDY OF

654
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
THIS KIND, ESPECIALLY TO A

655
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
CHILD?

656
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
>> IT'S -- YOU LOSE YOUR SENSE

657
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
OF INNOCENCE.

658
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
YOU GO TO A SCHOOL THAT IS A

659
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
PLACE WHERE EVERYTHING IS SAFE

660
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
AND GOOD.

661
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
YOUR TEACHER IS A PERSON THAT

662
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
PROTECTS AND WE'RE HEARING

663
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
UNBELIEVABLE STORIES OF TEACHERS

664
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
AND ADMINISTRATORS LITERALLY

665
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
LAYING DOWN THEIR LIVES FOR

666
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
THEIR KIDS.

667
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
AT OUR CHURCH, IT WAS A SUNDAY

668
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
MORNING WORSHIP SERVICE.

669
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
LAST PLACE YOU'D EXPECT VIOLENCE

670
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
BUT VIOLENCE DID COME.

671
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
YOU HAVE TO TALK HONESTLY ABOUT

672
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
EVIL AND THAT GOOD OVERCOMES

673
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
EVIL AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO
MAKE SURE THAT YOUR KIDS FEEL

674
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
PROTECTED AND SAFE.

675
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
WE DID THAT AT OUR CHURCH.

676
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
IT'S A SAFE PLACE TO WORSHIP NOW

677
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
BUT WE'VE CREATED A SENSE OF

678
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
SAFETY AND PEOPLE NOW ARE

679
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
SMILING AGAIN AND I THINK YOU
JUST HAVE TO TALK HONESTLY WITH

680
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
YOUR CHILDREN AND LISTEN

681
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
HONESTLY AND GIVE HONEST ANSWERS
TO REALLY HARD QUESTIONS.

682
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
>> PASTOR, MY COLLEAGUE BACK IN

683
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
ATLANTA, DEBORAH FEYERICK HAS A

684
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
QUESTION FOR YOU.
>> PASTOR, IT'S INTERESTING.

685
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I HEAR YOU SAY IT'S ABOUT GOOD

686
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
VERSUS EVIL BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT

687
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
LIFE VERSUS DEATH AND I READ

688
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
SOMETHING THAT RESONATED WITH

689
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
ME.
A PSYCHOLOGIST WROTE, WE WALK

690
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
THROUGH LIFE WITH THE WONDERFUL
MYTH OF INVULNERABILITY.

691
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
WE THINK OUR HUMANITY IS

692
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
SOMETHING SPECIAL, SACRED, AND
PRECIOUS AND THEN SOMETHING LIKE

693
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
THIS COMES ALONG AND IT MAKES

694
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
YOU REALIZE THAT YOU ARE
FRAGILE, THAT YOU ARE VULNERABLE

695
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
AND THAT'S WHERE THE TRAUMA SETS

696
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
IN, THAT E. OH, MY GOD, THIS

697
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
COULD HAVE BEEN ANY OF OUR

698
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
SCHOOLS.
THIS COULD BE ANY OF OUR

699
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
CHILDREN AND, FRANKLY, THE

700
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
SHOOTER COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY

701
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
WE ALL KNOW.
>> EXACTLY RIGHT.

702
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES

703
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT AND
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK

704
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
ABOUT THIS WEEKEND.

705
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT -- WE

706
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
NEED TO HAVE BETTER

707
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO BE

708
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
BETTER PARENTS, HOW TO BE BETTER

709
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
FRIENDS, HOW TO ESTABLISH A

710
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
COMMUNITY WHERE WE CAN HAVE

711
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
REALLY HONEST CONVERSATIONS

712
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
ABOUT PEOPLE THAT HAVE MENTAL

713
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
ILLNESS AND I THINK THE CHURCH

714
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
IS A GOOD PLACE TO START THAT

715
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
CONVERSATION.

716
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I THINK THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE

717
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
HAS TO COME TOGETHER AND WE HAVE

718
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
TO TALK ABOUT THE REALITIES OF

719
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
THE CULTURE IN WHICH WE LIVE.

720
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
WE DO NOT LIVE IN AN I'D LEGAL

721
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
LIST STICK BROKEN WORLD.

722
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
WE LIVE IN A BROKEN WORLD THAT

723
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
NEEDS REDEMPTION AND WE NEED TO

724
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
START HAVING SERIOUS
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO BE

725
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
BETTER PARENTS, HOW TO BE BETTER

726
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
FRIENDS, HOW TO HAVE TOUGHER

727
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
CONVERSATIONS --

728
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
>> PASTOR, WITH THAT SAID, THEN,

729
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HONEST
CONVERSATIONS AND BEING BETTER

730
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
PARENT.
I'M JUST GOING TO READ THIS.

731
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
THIS COMES ON THE HEEL -- THE

732
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
OREGON MALL SHOOTING, COLORADO

733
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
MOVIE THEATER WHICH I COVERED IN

734
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
DEPTH JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS

735
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
AGO, CONGRESSWOMAN GABRIELLE

736
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
GIFFORDS.
AS A PASTOR, DO YOU THINK YOU

737
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TALK TO

738
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
YOUR CONGREGATION ABOUT GUN

739
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
CONTROL IN THIS COUNTRY?

740
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
>> YES.
BUT THE BIGGER QUESTION IS

741
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
VIOLENCE.
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT HOW EASY IT

742
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
IS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE MEANT NT

743
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
DISTURBED TO GET GUNS.

744
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'M A GUN OWNER MYSELF BUT I

745
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT HOW

746
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
EASY IT IS FOR PEOPLE TO GET
THEIR HANDS ON THE GUNS.

747
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
BUT HOW ABOUT THE CULTURE OF

748
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
VIOLENCE?
WHERE'S THE OUTRAGE --

749
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
>> PASTOR, HANG ON.
I DON'T WANT TO BE

750
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
DISRESPECTFUL.
YES, I AGREE WITH YOU BUT THIS

751
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
PARTICULAR ISSUE IS ABOUT GUNS.

752
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
THIS PERSON WENT IN WITH GUNS.

753
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
NUMEROUS GUNS AND KILLED MANY

754
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
PEOPLE, CHILDREN.

755
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
HE DIDN'T BEAT THEM UP.

756
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
HE DIDN'T KNIFE THEM.

757
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
HE DIDN'T SET OFF A CANISTER OR

758
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
A MOLITOFF COCKTAIL AND EVERY

759
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
TIME I'M ON A SCENE COVERING A

760
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
STORY LIKE THIS, THE PERSON DOES

761
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
IT WITH GUNS.
AND WE CONTINUE TO SAY IT'S

762
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
ABOUT A CULTURE OF VIOLENCE.
IT'S ABOUT THIS.

763
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
IT'S ABOUT GUNS, PASTOR.

764
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, I OWN GUNS AND

765
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'M NOT VIOLENT.

766
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
LISTEN, I'M WITH YOU.

767
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I HEARD YOUR CONVERSATION

768
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
EARLIER AND I AGREE THAT WE NEED

769
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
TO HAVE CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF

770
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
WHO CAN PUT THEIR HANDS ON A

771
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
GUN.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I KNOW

772
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
TONS OF PEOPLE WHO OWN GUNS WHO

773
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
ARE NOT VIOLENT.
I THINK WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT

774
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
BOTH.
I'M AGREEING WITH YOU, THAT

775
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
THERE IS A CULTURE OF VIOLENCE.

776
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN TALK ABOUT

777
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
ONE WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THE

778
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
OTHER.
I AGREE WITH YOU.

779
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT BOTH.

780
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
>> YEAH.

781
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
AND I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

782
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
ARE RESPECTFUL OF GUNS, WHO KNOW

783
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
HOW TO USE GUNS AND GET TRAINING

784
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
AND THEN PEOPLE WHO DON'T

785
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
RESPECT GUNS OR LIFE AND THAT'S

786
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
THE CONVERSATION WE NEED TO BE

787
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
HAVING.

788
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
>> NO BOUGHT ABOUT IT.

789
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
>> THANK YOU, PASTOR BOYD.

790
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
>> THANK YOU.

791
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
GOD'S PEACE ON THESE PEOPLE IN

792
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
CONNECTICUT.

793
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
>> AMEN.
THANK YOU.

794
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
>>> PRESIDENT OBAMA PROMISING TO

795
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
TAKE WHAT HE CALLS MEANINGFUL

796
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
ACTION TO PREVENT TRAGEDIES LIKE
THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

797
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
BRIANNA KEILAR IS LIVE WITH THE

798
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
LATEST FOR US.

799
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID MEANINGFUL

800
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
YESTERDAY.
HE EVEN TEARED UP.

801
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE LAST

802
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
NIGHT FOR A -- SUPPOSED TO BE A

803
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
CELEBRATION BUT IT WAS KIND OF

804
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
SOMBER AND THE PRESIDENT

805
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
MENTIONED THAT AT THE CHRISTMAS

806
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
PARTY THE VICTIMS OF THIS

807
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
PARTICULAR TRAGEDY.

808
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY MEANINGFUL?

809
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
>> Reporter: MEANINGFUL ACTION,

810
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
ACTUALLY, WE DON'T KNOW.

811
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
WHAT WE DO KNOW AND THIS IS THE

812
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
SENSE I'M GETTING IS THAT HE

813
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
DOES MEAN SOMETHING, THAT HE

814
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
DOES ACTUALLY MEAN THAT SOME

815
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN BUT IN

816
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
TERMS OF THE SPECIFICS, DON, WE

817
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE.

818
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
AND THIS IS THE SENSE I'M

819
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
GETTING THAT THIS IS A GENERAL

820
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
PROMISE TO PURSUE SOMETHING TO

821
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
TRY TO AVERT FUTURE TRAGEDIES

822
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
LIKE THIS ONE.

823
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
THE SENSE HERE AT THE WHITE

824
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
HOUSE IS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

825
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
SORT OF EXPERIENCED WITH THE

826
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
COUNTRY ALMOST A HANDFUL NOW OF

827
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
THESE TRAGEDIES BETWEEN FT.

828
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
HOOD, BETWEEN THE SHOOTING OF

829
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
CONGRESSWOMAN GABBY GIFFORDS,

830
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
THE SIKH TEMPLE SHOOTING THAT

831
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
YOU MENTIONED AND THIS ONE,

832
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
ESPECIALLY WITH THE AGE OF THE
VICTIMS, JUST SORT OF REALLY

833
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
BRINGING HOME THE FACT THAT

834
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
SOMETHING'S NOT WORKING.

835
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
THAT THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY OF

836
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
THESE INSTANCES HAPPENING AND

837
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE.

838
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
WE DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS.

839
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE

840
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT HIS OPTIONS

841
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
MAY BE, ONE OPTION MAY BE

842
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
FINDING A WAY TO LIMIT THE

843
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
NUMBER OF BULLETS AND MAGAZINES,

844
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH

845
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
ISSUES.
WE HAVE YET TO SEE WHAT ROLE

846
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
THAT PLAYED IN THIS TRAGEDY IN

847
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
CONNECTICUT.
BUT REPORTING OF MENTAL HEALTH

848
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE WHO

849
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
SHOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO GUNS

850
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
INDEED DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

851
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
THEM.
THAT'S JUST INFORMED SPECULATION

852
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
AT THIS POINT, DON, AS WE TRY TO

853
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT

854
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
MEANS WHEN HE SAYS SOMETHING

855
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
MEANINGFUL.
>> MEANINGFUL ACTION.

856
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
MEANINGFUL ACTION WOULD BE A

857
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
START, AT THE LEAST.

858
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000

898
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
THINK ABOUT A SCHOOL SHOOTING.

899
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
JOINING ME NOW IS AN AUTHOR FROM

900
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
NEW YORK.

901
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
DAVE, YOU WROTE ABOUT THE

902
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
TRAGEDY.

903
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
DOES YESTERDAY'S KILLING BEAR A

904
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
RESEMBLANCE TO THAT OR VIRGINIA

905
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
TECH OR ANY OF THE OTHER

906
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
SHOOTINGS?
>> WELL, YES IT DOES IN A WHOLE

907
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
LOT OF WAYS.

908
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
ESPECIALLY EMOTIONALLY I THINK

909
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
FOR ALL OF US.

910
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I TALKED TO QUITE A FEW OF THE

911
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
COLUMBINE SURVIVORS YESTERDAY

912
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
WHO WERE HAVING REALLY, REALLY
ROUGH DAYS IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

913
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
IT PULLS THAT TOGETHER AND THEN

914
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
OF COURSE THE SAME QUESTIONS

915
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
THAT WE'RE ASKING WITH EVERYONE

916
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
WANTING TO KNOW HE WHY AND WE

917
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES IN THAT
CASE OF JUMPING TOO QUICKLY TO

918
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
WHY.
I THINK THE PRESS IS MUCH BETTER

919
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
NOW AT UNDERSTANDING TO BE MORE

920
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
CAUTIOUS ABOUT THESE THINGS BUT

921
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
STILL A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND WHY

922
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
THIS HAPPENED AND HOW IT FITS

923
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
INTO THIS WIDER PICTURE OF WHY
ALL OF THESE SHOOTINGS.

924
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
>> IS THERE ANYTHING THAT --

925
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
WITH BETWEEN ALL OF THE

926
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
SHOOTINGS, THE SUSPECTS, IS

927
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
THERE ANYTHING THAT RESONATES

928
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
WITH YOU ABOUT DETECTING SIGNS

929
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
THAT A PERSON IS ABOUT TO COMMIT
SUCH A HORRIFIC CRIME OR DO

930
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
THESE PEOPLE SOMETIMES JUST

931
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
SNAP?
>> YEAH, THAT'S A GREAT

932
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
QUESTION.
THEY DEFINITELY DON'T SNAP.

933
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
THAT'S A WORD WE SHOULD ACTUALLY

934
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
TRY TO TAKE OUT OF OUR

935
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
VOCABULARY.

936
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
IN ALMOST ALL CASES IT'S A VERY

937
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
SLOW BUILD.
THE SECRET SERVICE DID A

938
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
REMARKABLE STUDY OF ALL OF THE
CASES OF SCHOOL SHOOTERS OVER A

939
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
25-YEAR PERIOD AND THE VAST

940
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
MAJORITY PLAN THEM IN ADVANCE.

941
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
MANY FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS IN

942
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
ADVANCE.

943
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I BELIEVE I SAW BEFORE WE WENT

944
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
ON AIR THAT THERE'S A REPORT

945
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
THAT THIS GUNMAN TRIED TO BUY A

946
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
GUN ON TUESDAY OR EARLIER IN THE

947
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
WEEK.
SO AT LEAST EARLIER HE WAS

948
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
PLANNING.
THAT'S NORMAL.

949
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
IT'S TYPICALLY A SLOW D

950
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
DISINTEGRATION.
THERE ARE THREE MAIN TYPES AND

951
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
THE MOST PREVALENT PART IS THE

952
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
ANGRY SUPPRESSIVE.

953
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
PICTURE A PERSON WHO IS

954
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
SUICIDELY DEPRESSED, AND WRITING

955
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
ABOUT COMMITTING SUICIDE FOR TWO

956
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
YEARS.
IT'S A REALLY, REALLY SORT OF

957
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
SLOW, DOWNWARD SPIRAL.

958
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
PAST SADNESS INTO A SENSE OF

959
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
HOPELENESS AND SENSELENESS FOR

960
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE.
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE

961
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
SITUATION HERE BUT THAT'S MOST

962
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
OFTEN WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.

963
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
IF THERE'S A LESSON FROM ANY OF

964
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
THESE, THE MOST EASY WAY TO

965
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
IMPROVE THE SITUATION IS DEAL

966
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
WITH ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION.

967
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
>> I WAS JUST TALKING TO A WHITE

968
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT.

969
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I WAS TALKING TO FORMER FBI

970
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR TOM FUENTES

971
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
ABOUT THIS.
THE PRESIDENT SAID SOME

972
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
MEANINGFUL ACTION TO MODIFY GUN

973
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
CONTROL.

974
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
HAVING WRITTEN ABOUT COLUMBINE,

975
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
WITNESSING VIRGINIA TECH AND

976
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
SOME OF THESE THINGS, WHAT DO

977
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
YOU THINK?

978
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
IS IT TIME TO DO SOMETHING

979
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
MEANFUL ABOUT GUN LAWS IN THIS
COUNTRY?

980
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
>> I THINK IT IS.
I THINK MOST OF US ARE FEELING

981
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
MORE HOPEFUL BECAUSE I THINK
WE'VE LEARNED THAT NO ONE OF

982
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
THESE EVENTS IS GOING TO CAUSE A

983
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
BIG CHANGE.

984
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
AFTER COLUMBINE THAT NOW THE

985
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
COUNTRY WILL WAKE UP AND WE'LL
DO SOMETHING AND IN FACT WE

986
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
DIDN'T.
WE LEFT THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN

987
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
HE CAN PYRE.

988
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
AFTER GABRIELLE GIFFORDS, THERE

989
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
WERE OTHER DIFFERENT TIMES.

990
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I THINK WE'VE LEARNED OUR LESSON

991
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
THAT IT CAN'T BE A RESPONSE TO
ANY ONE TRAGEDY.

992
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
WE NEED TO MARSHAL FORCES AND

993
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
PEOPLE BECOMING MORE AND MORE

994
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
ADAMANT.

995
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
JUST LIKE YOU SAID EARLIER, WE

996
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
NEED TO BE MORE SERIOUS.

997
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
YOU SAID YOU'VE BEEN COVERING

998
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
THIS FOR YEARS AND EVERY TIME

999
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
YOU'RE ON SITE IT'S BECAUSE

1000
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
SOMEONE DID THIS WITH A GUN.

1001
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
LET'S FACE THE OBVIOUS, THAT

1002
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
THERE ARE GUNS HERE.

1003
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
IN CHINA, APPARENTLY THE SAME

1004
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
DAY AS SOMEBODY WENT ON A

1005
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
RAMPAGE WITH A KNIFE AND I DON'T

1006
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
REMEMBER THE EXACT AMOUNT

1007
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
INJURED, MORE THAN 20 PEOPLE.

1008
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
AND SO FAR NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
HAVE DIED BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD

1009
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
TO KILL OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH

1010
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
A KNIFE.

1011
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
AND GUNS ARE HAVE THE PROBLEM.

1012
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE

1013
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
KILLERS THEMSELVES AND THE GUNS

1014
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
AND WE NEED TO STOP THIS

1015
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
CONVERSATION OF LIKE SHOULD WE
TALK ABOUT THE GUNS OR THE

1016
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
KILLERS?

1017
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
GUNS OR KILLERS?

1018
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
IT'S BOTH.
WE NEED TO ADDRESS BOTH AND TRY

1019
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
TO SHRINK BOTH OF THOSE AND MAKE
THE GUNS LESS AVAILABLE AND FIND

1020
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
OUT WHAT LEADS TO KILLERS AND

1021
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
THAT'S THE ONLY HOPE OF REDUCING

1022
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
THIS DRAMATICALLY.

1023
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
>> DAVE CULLEN, IT'S DEB

1024
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
FEYERICK.
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH

1025
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
COLUMBINE.
YOU SAW HOW THAT PLAYED OUT.

1026
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
THE QUESTION, OBVIOUSLY, IS WHEN

1027
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
SOMEBODY WANTS TO DO SOMETHING

1028
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
LIKE THIS, WHY DO YOU HAVE THOSE

1029
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
WHO ARE IN FACT MOST VULNERABLE

1030
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
TO GOING TO AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

1031
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
TO 5, 6, 7, 8, 9-YEAR-OLDS,

1032
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
THERE'S SOMETHING PATHOLOGICAL

1033
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
ABOUT THAT.
>> IT IS.

1034
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
IT WAS REALLY APPALLING TO ME.

1035
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I WENT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN --

1036
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, I SPENT THE

1037
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
LAST 13 YEARS TRYING TO

1038
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
UNDERSTAND THE KILLERS AND

1039
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
TRYING TO SORT OF PUT MYSELF IN

1040
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
THEIR SHOES AND UNDERSTAND WHY.

1041
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WITH SO MANY

1042
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
DIFFERENT CONFERENCES WITH, YOU

1043
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
KNOW, PEOPLE WHO ARE AUTHORITIES

1044
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
AND HAVE BEEN STUDYING THESE FOR

1045
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
THEIR ENTIRE CAREER, SHRINKS,

1046
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT, OTHER PEOPLE,

1047
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
ONE THING THAT I'VE SETTLED ON

1048
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
IS THAT THE KILLER ALWAYS HAS A

1049
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
REASON.
IN THEIR MIND, IT'S NOT

1050
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
SENSELESS REASON.
THERE WAS SOME REASONING THAT

1051
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
WORKED FOR THEM AND IF WE'RE

1052
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
GOING TO REALLY WANT TO SOLVE

1053
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
THIS, WE HAVE TO GET IN THEIR

1054
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
HEADS AND UNDERSTAND FROM THEIR

1055
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
POINT OF VIEW.

1056
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
SO THAT'S BEEN MY MISSION FOR

1057
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS BUT

1058
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
YESTERDAY THAT WAS REALLY HARD
TO DO.

1059
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
YOU JUST SHOWED THAT LITTLE BOY

1060
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
GETTING INTERVIEWED AND I DON'T

1061
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
KNOW HOW YOU SHOOT AT ONE -- I

1062
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
DON'T KNOW HOW YOU KILL ANYBODY

1063
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
BUT ESPECIALLY SOMEBODY LIKE

1064
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
THAT, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO

1065
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
ONE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU KEEP DOING

1066
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
IT.
BUT ALL THAT ASIDE, I CAN TELL

1067
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
YOU ACTUALLY HOW IT SOMETIMES

1068
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
DOES HAPPEN AND WE DON'T KNOW IF

1069
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
THIS IS THE SITUATION HERE BUT

1070
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
MOST OFTEN WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE
DEEPLY DEPRESSED AND SUICIDAL,

1071
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
THE MOST COMMON THING THEY DO IF

1072
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
THEY ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING
DRASTIC IS KILL THEMSELVES AND

1073
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO IF GO

1074
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
ONE STEP BEYOND THAT AND TAKE

1075
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
OUT THE SOURCE OF THEIR PAIN

1076
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
WHICH IS USUALLY BOSS,

1077
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
GIRLFRIEND, A FAMILY MEMBER.

1078
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
THEY SHOOT THE BOSS, GIRLFRIEND,
PARENT, WHOEVER IS SORT OF LIKE

1079
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
THE SYMBOL OF THAT PAIN.

1080
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
THE NEXT STEP OF PEOPLE WHO TAKE
IT ONE STEP FURTHER ARE PEOPLE

1081
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
WHO ATTACK NOT JUST THAT PERSON

1082
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
BUT OTHER PERSON AROUND THEM.
SO IF THE WIFE OR THE GIRLFRIEND

1083
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
IS THE PROBLEM, YOU ALSO KILL
THE GIRLFRIEND WHO I KNOW IS

1084
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000

>> DEB AND DAVE, WE'VE TALKED A

1088
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
LOT ABOUT THIS AND I THINK IT

1089
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
HAS TO DO WITH SOMETHING THAT WE

1090
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
DON'T DISCUSS A LOT AND THAT IS

1091
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
THAT THING CALLED ATTACHMENT

1092
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
INJURIES, WHEN PEOPLE FEEL

1093
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
BETRAYED BY OTHER PEOPLE,

1094
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
WHETHER IT'S RELEVANT IN THEIR

1095
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
MIND OR NOT.

1096
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO THERAPISTS

1097
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
ABOUT THIS A LOT LATELY AND IT'S

1098
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO LEARN

1099
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
ABOUT.

1100
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
PERHAPS IT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN

1101
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
THIS CASE.

1102
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
MAYBE NOT.
DAVE AND DEB, THANK YOU.

1103
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
OF ALL OF THIS TO MAKE IT ALL

1108
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
BETTER?
WHAT CAN THEY DO TO MAKE SURE

1109
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
THAT THEIR STUDENTS FEEL SAFE
AND SAFEGUARD THE FACILITIES?

1110
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000

THIS HAD IS A VERY BUSY SQUARE

1137
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1138
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
SOME PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM

1139
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
TOWNS AROUND THE AREA JUST TO

1140
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000

THIS BROADCAST, WE'RE GOING TO

1144
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
GO THROUGH THIS AS SENSITIVELY

1145
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
AND RESPECTFUL AS WE CAN DO.

1146
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
THIS IS TOUGH FOR ANY JOURNALIST

1147
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
TO COVER BUT NOT AS NEAR AS

1148
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
DIFFICULT AS WHAT THE FAMILIES

1149
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
ARE DEALING WITH AND OUR HEARTS

1150
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
AND PRAYERS GO OUT WITH THEM.

1151
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
AND THAT SAID, I WANT TO SAY

1152
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
THAT WE ARE AWAITING THE NEWEST

00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
NEWS CONFERENCE FROM THE

NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

1156
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW.

1157
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL SAYS --

1158
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
AND THIS IS THE SUSPECT'S NAME.

1159
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA.

1160
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
WE WILL SAY THAT AS LITTLE AS

1161
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
POSSIBLE.
WE HAVE TO DO IT FOR THE RECORD.

1162
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
THAT HE HAD SOME SORT OF

1163
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
ALTERCATION WITH PEOPLE AT THE
SCHOOL A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE

1164
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
SHOOTING.
THE OFFICIAL DOES NOT KNOW --

1165
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
DOESN'T KNOW ANY DETAILS ABOUT
THAT ALTERCATION OR WHO IT

1166
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
INVOLVED.
WE ALSO LEARNED FROM A LAW

1167
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
ENFORCEMENT SOURCE THAT THE

1168
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
SUSPECT TRIED TO BUY A GUN THREE

1169
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
DAYS BEFORE THE SHOOTING BUT

1170
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
DIDN'T HAVE THE PROPER

1171
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
PAPERWORK.

1172
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
AND POLICE ALSO REVEAL TODAY

1173
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
THAT THREE GUNS, NOT TWO AS

1174
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT, WERE FOUND

1175
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
NEAR THE SUSPECT'S BODY INSIDE

1176
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
THE SCHOOL.
THE VICTIM'S BODIES HAVE BEEN

1177
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
REMOVED FROM THE SCHOOL.

1178
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I SHOULD SAY, THE HEROES IN ALL

1179
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
OF THIS.

1180
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
THEIR BODIES HAVE BEEN REMOVED

1181
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
FROM THE SCHOOL.
AND THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE

1182
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE.
THEIR NAMES ARE EXPECTED TO BE

1183
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
RELEASED SOON.

1184
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO LED

1185
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
EXTRAORDINARY LIVES AND WERE
TAKEN AWAY WAY TOO SOON.

1186
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
AND JUST THIS MORNING, PARENTS

1187
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
WERE DROPPING OFF THEIR KIDS

1188
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
LIKE ANY OTHER DAY.

1189
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
JUST YESTERDAY MORNING, I SHOULD

1190
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
SAY.
LIKE ANY OTHER DAY.

1191
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
NO ONE COULD HAVE MANAGED THE
CARNAGE AND HORROR THAT WOULD

1192
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
OCCUR JUST HOURS LATER.

1193
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000

HOW DO YOU COPE, EVEN BEGIN TO

HEAL OR EXPLAIN WHAT HAS

1196
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
HAPPENED HERE?
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU START,

1197
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
WHICH IS WHY I WANT THE HELP OF

1198
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST.

1199
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000

00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
JEFF, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO

1201
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000

WITH FAMILIES DEALING WITH THIS,

1205
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
PARENTS WHO SENT THEIR KIDS TO

1206
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
SCHOOL, WENT OFF TO WORK OR OFF

1207
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
TO DO WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING,
GETTING READY FOR THE HOLIDAYS,

1208
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
MAYBE THEY WERE WELL, I JUST THO

1209
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
BE VERY HONEST WITH OURSELVES

1210
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
THAT MANY OF US FEEL LIKE YOU,

DON.
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN.

1212

BUT THERE IS A PLACE AND THAT IS

1213
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
WHAT THE POLICE ARE DOING AND

1214
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000

1215
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000

DEBRIEFING TO NOT JUST GET

1217
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000

1218
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
FAMILIES TO ALLOW THE PARENTS,

1219
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
TO ALLOWS THE FRIENDS TO JUST BE

1220
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
ABLE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE

1221
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000

00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
BE TAKING SUCH A LONG TIME FOR

1225
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
THEM TO GET THROUGH, BUT MOST

1226
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
IMPORTANTLY, TO HELP STABILIZE

1227
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000

1228

GET SUPPORT AND THAT THEY HAVE

1231
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
AN OPEN COMMUNICATION, SHOULDERS

1232
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR THEM TO

1233
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
CRY ON TO LEAN ON.

1234
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000

>> PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING

SHOOTER, THE GUNMAN, THAT HE HAD

1238
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
A FORM OF AUTISM.

1239
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
AUTISM IS NOT A MENTAL ILLNESS.

1240
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
IT'S NOT A SOCIAL ILLNESS.

1241
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
IT'S A NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER,

1242
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
RIGHT?

1243
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

1244
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
>> NEUROBIOLOGICAL DISORDER.

1245
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
>> YES, BIOLOGICAL.

1246

WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT AUTISM,

1247
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
WE'RE LOOKING AT, THERE IS A

1248
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
HIGH INHERITABILITY, IN OTHER

1249
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
WORDS THAT IT IS INHERITED.

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
AND QUITE OFTEN THERE ARE ISSUES

1251
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
WITH THE CHROMOSOMES, 15 AND 16

1252
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
WHICH ARE MARKERS FOR AUTISM.

1253
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
SO WE SEE IT IS AS YOU SAY THIS

1254
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
BIOLOGICAL COMPONENT.

1255
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
WE FIND THAT 85% OF PEOPLE WITH

1256
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
AUTISM ARE MENTALLY RETARDED BUT

1257
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
YOU DO HAVE A CERTAIN PORTION

1258
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
WHO ARE PART OF THE AUTISM

1259
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
SPECTRUM AND HAVE AS THIS PERSON

1260
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
REPORTEDLY ALLEGEDLY HAD, SOME

1261
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
SORT OF ASPERGER'S WHICH IS A

1262
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
VERY HIGH FUNCTIONING AUTISM AND

1263
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
SOME OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE

1264
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT, BUT HAVE

1265
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
PROBLEMS LIKE OTHER AUTISTIC

1266
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
PERSONS BEING ABLE TO INTERACT

1267
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
IN A SOCIAL WAY, SPENDING A LOT

1268
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
OF TIME ALONE JUST NOT HAVING

1269
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
THE GENERAL SOCIAL SKILLS.

1270
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
>> BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T

1271
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
WANT TO DISFARNLG EVERYONE WHO

1272
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
HAS AUTISM.

1273
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
YOU DON'T WANT TO BLAME AUTISM

1274
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
FOR THEIR PROBLEM.

1275
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
MANY PEOPLE AS I'M READING HERE

1276
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
DESCRIBE THIS GUNMAN AS NICE AND

1277
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
POLITE.
THEY SAY THEY WERE SHOCKED

1278
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
BECAUSE HE NEVER SHOWED ANY

1279
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
VIOLENT TENDENCIES.

1280
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I MEAN, CAN YOU -- DOES AUTISM

1281
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
EXPLAIN THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR?

1282
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I DON'T THINK SO.
>> QUITE FRANKLY, AUTISM DOESN'T

1283
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
EXPLAIN THIS AT ALL.

1284
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I WORK WITH MANY AUTISTIC

1285
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
PATIENTS.

1286
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I'VE WORKED WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE

1287
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
HIGH FUNCTIONING AUTISM, WHICH

1288
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
IS ASPERGER'S, AND BY THE WAY, I

1289
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
SHOULD POINT OUT AS A CAUTIONARY

1290
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
TALE, WE FIND ONE OF THE MAJOR

1291
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
CAUSES OF AUTISM IS THIS WHOLE

1292
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
IDEA OF NOT ONLY IS IT PASSED

1293
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
ON, BUT CERTAINLY SOME IMMUNE

1294
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
PROBLEMS THAT WOMEN HAVE WHEN

1295
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
THEY'RE CARRYING THEIR CHILDREN.

1296
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
AS FAR AS IN UTERO.

1297
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
BUT YES, WE JUST DO NOT FIND

1298
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU ANT --

1299
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
AUTISTIC.

1300
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
WE DO FIND THERE IS AN ISSUE AS

1301
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
A MAN GOES INTO MANHOOD OR ADULT

1302
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
HOOD, THEY MAY BE MUCH HARDER TO

1303
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
MANAGE, THEY MAY HAVE SOME FITS

1304
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
OF ANGER, BUT WE DON'T SEE THEM

1305
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
GOING OUT AND COMMITTING MURDER

1306
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
AND MAYHEM.

1307
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
THIS IS MORE OF AN ISSUE BETWEEN

1308
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
A PARENT AND A CHILD GETTING

1309
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
THEM TO JUST BE MORE PRODUCTIVE.

1310
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT

1311
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
ASPERGER'S, WE THINK THAT THERE

1312
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
ARE HEADS OF CORPORATIONS WHO

1313
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
HAVE ASPERGER'S, AGAINST THIS IS

1314
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
HIGH FUNCTIONING AUTISM.

1315
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
>> AND IT'S INTERESTING, IT

1316
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE SOME PERSON

1317
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
IN THEIR 20s, SOME YOUNG PERSON

1318
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
AND YOU KNOW, GETTING OLDER YOU

1319
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
REALIZE WHEN I WAS IN MY 20s, I

1320
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
THOUGHT I KNEW EVERYTHING AND

1321
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
EVERYTHING WOULD SET ME OFF.

1322
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
THE OLDER YOU GET, THE MORE YOU

1323
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
REALIZE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW.

1324
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
IS THERE SOMETHING JUST ABOUT

1325
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
YOUTH THAT WE'RE NOT TEACHING

1326
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
OUR KIDS OR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT

1327
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
THEY THINK THEY KNOW EVERYTHING

1328
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
AND THEY THINK THAT YOU KNOW,

1329
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
THE WORLD REVOLVES AROUND THEM

1330
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
AND THEY HAVE THE RIGHT AND THE

1331
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
POWER TO TAKE OUT OTHER PEOPLE?

1332
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
>> WELL, IT IS THAT, DON.

1333
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
WE SEE THAT OUR YOUTH ARE VERY

1334
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
MUCH DISAFFECTED, AND PART OF

1335
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
THAT, AND YOU KNOW, YOU'VE KNOWN

1336
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
ME FOR YEARS NOW.

1337
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I'M NOT INTO THE POINTING

1338
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
FINGERS AND BLAMING THE MEDIA

1339
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
AND BLAMING THIS OR THAT.

1340
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
THOUGH WE DO HAVE TO LOOK AT

1341
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
THIS WHOLE IDEA OF MENTAL HEALTH

1342
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
LAWS, GUN LAWS AND PERHAPS

1343
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
HELPING PEOPLE MORE THAN THEY'RE

1344
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
GETTING HELP.
BUT I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT TOO

1345
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
OFTEN, OUR CHILDREN LIVE IN A

1346
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
VIRTUAL REALITY.

1347
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
THE REALITY OF MANY VIOLENT

1348
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
VIDEOS.
EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A LOT OF

1349
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
KIDS WHO PLAY THESE VIOLENT

1350
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
VIDEOS AND NOTHING HAPPENS TO

1351
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
THEM, THEY DON'T GO OUT AND KILL

1352
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
ANYONE, IF YOU HAVE A PERSON WHO

1353
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
HAS SOME MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR

1354
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
WHO MAY BE LIMITED IN SOME WAY

1355
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
OR IS IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS

1356
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
CATASTROPHIC, WE HAVE TO BE

1357
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
CAREFUL TO NOT LET THEM DRIFT

1358
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
INTO THE MARGINS OF SOCIETY AND

1359
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
IN THIS CASE AS WE NOTE WITH

1360
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
THIS YOUNG MAN, SPENDING A LOT

1361
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
OF TIME GAMING, SPENDING A LOT

1362
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
OF TIME ON THESE VIDEO GAMES

1363
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
BECAUSE THAT, AS WE SEE, IS A

1364
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
RECIPE FOR DISASTER.

1365
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
>> LIVING VIRTUAL LIVES INSTEAD

1366
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
OF INTERACTING AND LIVING A

1367
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
REAL-LIFE WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

1368
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
THANK YOU, JEFF, GARDERE.

1369
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
APPRECIATE THAT.

1370
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
>> SURE.
>> YOU CAN BET THAT SCHOOLS

1371
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE GOING TO

1372
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
BE RE-EVALUATING THEIR SECURITY

1373
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
PROCEDURES.
THIS SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD JUST

1374
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
DONE IT TO TRY TO PREVENT A

1375
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
TRAGEDY SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED

1376
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
HERE IN CONNECTICUT.

1377
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
KENNETH TRUMP IS THE PRESIDENT

1378
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY AND

1379
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
SAFETY SERVICES.

1380
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
HE JOINS ME LIVE FROM CLEVELAND.

1381
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
PARENTS ARE ON THE EDGE THINKING

1382
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
ABOUT SENDING THEIR CHILDREN

1383
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
BACK TO SCHOOL AFTER THE

1384
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
SHOOTING.
I IMAGINE MANY PARENTS ARE.

1385
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
WHAT CAN SCHOOLS IMMEDIATELY DO

1386
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
TO KEEP THEIR KIDS SAFE?

1387
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
>> PARENTS NEED TO REMEMBER THAT

1388
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
THE FIRST THING THEY SHOULD DO

1389
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
IS TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO

1390
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
SCHOOL.

1391
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
MONDAY WILL BE THE SAFEST DAY

1392
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
YOU COULD EVER BE IN A SCHOOL IN

1393
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE THERE'S

1394
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
GOING TO BE A HEIGHTENED

1395
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
AWARENESS AND HEIGHTENED

1396
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
SECURITY MEASURES.

1397
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
THAT'S CRITICAL.

1398
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
WE SAW WAVES OF CHILDREN STAY

1399
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
HOME AFTER COLUMN BRIAN.
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT NOW.

1400
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
PARENTS SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE

1401
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
TALKING TO YOUR PRINCIPALS.

1402
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY CHILD'S

1403
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
SCHOOL TO IMPROVE SAFETY?

1404
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
HOW WELL PREPARED ARE YOU TO

1405
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
MANAGE AN EMERGENCY SITUATION?

1406
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
TESTIMONY SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY

1407
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
DOING THINGS.

1408
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
PARENTS, UNFORTUNATELY, JUST

1409
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT OR HAVEN'T

1410
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
ASKED AND THE SCHOOLS PERHAPS

1411
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
HAVEN'T COMMUNICATED AS PRO

1412
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
ACTIVELY AS THEY SHOULD.

1413
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO THROW

1414
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
OUT THE PLAYBOOK OF BEST

1415
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
PRACTICES IN SCHOOL SAFETY.

1416
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
WE DON'T NEED TO BE TEACHING

1417
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
ELEMENTARY KIDS TO THROW PENCILS

1418
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
AND BACKPACKS AT ARMED INTRUDERS

1419
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
AND HAVE A METAL DETECTOR AT

1420
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
EVERY DOOR.
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE

1421
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
FUNDAMENTALS THAT WE'VE LEARNED

1422
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
FROM COLUMBINE DEALING WITH

1423
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
PREVENTION, MENTAL HEALTH

1424
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
SERVICES, COUNSELORS,

1425
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS, SECURITY, SCHOOL

1426
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
RESOURCE OFFICERS, TRAINING YOUR

1427
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
STAFF, HAVING EMERGENCY PLANS,

1428
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
PRACTICING DRILLS.

1429
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
THESE THINGS ARE SOLID BEST

1430
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
PRACTICES.

1431
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
>> HEY, KENNETH, I WANT TO GO

1432
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
BACK TO SOMETHING YOU SAID.

1433
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
EVERY SINGLE PERSON TO A PERSON,

1434
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
EVERYONE WHO'S SPOKEN TO ME

1435
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
TODAY ABOUT THIS ISSUE TALKING

1436
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
ABOUT GUNS, EVERYONE HAS SAID

1437
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
MENTAL HEALTH.

1438
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
THAT SEEMS TO BE A BIG ISSUE.

1439
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

1440
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
MISSING WHEN IT COMES TO MENTAL

1441
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
HEALTH OR TEACHING PEOPLE ABOUT

1442
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR LEARNING

1443
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
MORE ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH OF

1444
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
SNUNLDS IS THERE SOMETHING

1445
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
MISSING HERE?
>> WELL, IF YOU RECALL BACK TO

1446
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
COLUMBINE, FOR YEARS, BULLYING

1447
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
WAS BLAMED, BUT IN SOME RESEARCH

1448
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
THAT WAS DONE BY TWO SEPARATE

1449
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
AUTHORS, THEY REALLY CAME DOWN

1450
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
TO THE SAME ISSUE AGAIN OF

1451
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
MENTAL HEALTH.

1452
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I THINK IT'S VERY EASY TO TALK

1453
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
ABOUT GETTING YOUR ARMS AROUND

1454
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
BULLYING OR THINGS THAT WE CAN

1455
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
ALL RELATE TO, BUT MENTAL HEALTH

1456
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
IS MUCH MORE COMPLEX.

1457
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WALKING

1458
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
OUR STREETS WITH UNDIAGNOSED AND

1459
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
OR UNTREATED MENTAL HEALTH

1460
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
ISSUES.

1461
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT?

1462
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
IT'S EASIER TO PREDICT STUDENT

1463
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
ON STUDENT VIOLENCE AND TO GET A

1464
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
JUMP AHEAD OF THAT WHEN YOU KNOW

1465
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
YOUR KIDS.
IT'S HARDER FOR A PRINCIPAL TO

1466
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
KNOW A LONE WOLF ACTOR IS GOING

1467
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
TO WALK ACROSS THE SCHOOLHOUSE

1468
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
DOOR AND WHAT THEIR MENTAL

1469
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
STATUS IS.

1470
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
>> YEAH.

1471
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
LISTEN, LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT

1472
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
JUST SECURING THE SCHOOLS.

1473
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
WE CAN'T TURN SCHOOLS INTO MINI

1474
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
PRISONS FOR STUDENTS.

1475
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
SO THEN WHAT DO YOU DO?

1476
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
>> THE FIRST AND BEST LINE OF

1477
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
DEFENSE IS ALWAYS A WELL-TRAINED

1478
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
HIGHLY ALERT STAFF AND STUDENT

1479
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
BODY.
THE NUMBER ONE WAY WE FIND OUT

1480
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
ABOUT WEAPONS IN SCHOOL

1481
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
CONSISTENTLY HAS BEEN FROM KIDS
WHO KNOW THAT OTHER KIDS HAVE

1482
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
THEM AND WHEN WE'RE TALKING

1483
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
ABOUT VIOLENCE INSIDE THE

1484
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
SCHOOL, HAVING SCHOOL RESOURCE

1485
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
OFFICERS WHO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS

1486
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
WITH KIDS ALONG WITH OTHER

1487
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
SCHOOL STAFF SO THAT THE KIDS

1488
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
COME FORWARD TO TELL YOU

1489
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
PROBLEMS THAT ARE GOING ON AT

1490
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
HOME.

1491
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
ABUSE, FAMILY DYSFUNCTIONAL

1492
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
ISSUES, SITUATIONS THAT ARE

1493
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
GOING TO ADD FAMILY STRESSORS

1494
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
THAT MAY SPILL OVER INTO THE

1495
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
SCHOOL.

1496
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
