PROVIDE IMPORTANT CLUES INTO THE

301
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
MOTIVE BEHIND THE SHOOTING.

302
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
BY ALL ACCOUNTS, LANZA DIDN'T

HE PROBABLY WALKED IN AND I

604

COULD SEE HIM FROM THE KNEES

605
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000

KNOW HOW MANY SHOOTERS THERE

635
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000

GO.

654
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000

656
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000

THAT.

658
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
