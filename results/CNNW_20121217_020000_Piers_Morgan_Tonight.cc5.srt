00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
KNOWING HER, AS HER MOTHER, AS

374
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
WELL AS ANYBODY IN THE WORLD

375
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
KNEW HER, DID IT SURPRISE YOU

376
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
THAT SHE WAS SO COURAGEOUS IN

377
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
SUCH A TERRIFYING MOMENT?

378
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
>> NOT AT ALL.

379
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
SHE WAS TRULY SELFLESS.

380
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
SHE WOULD NOT HESITATE TO THINK

381
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
TO SAVE ANYONE ELSE BEFORE

382
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
HERSELF, AND ESPECIALLY

383
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
CHILDREN.

384
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
SHE LOVED THEM MORE THAN LIFE,

385
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
AND SHE WOULD DEFINITELY PUT

386
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
HERSELF IN FRONT OF THEM ANY

387
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
DAY, ANY DAY AND FOR ANY REASON.

388
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ANYBODY THAT

389
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
KNOWS VICKI THAT SHE DID THIS.

390
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
>> CARLY, VICKI WAS YOUR SISTER,

391
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
YOU WERE ALL VERY CLOSE, AS YOUR

392
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
MOTHER JUST SAID.

393
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A TERRIBLE,

394
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
TORRENTIAL LOSS, YOU MUST BE

395
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
GRIEVING HORRIBLY, YET AT THE

396
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
SAME TIME HEARING THE PRESIDENT

397
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
OF THE UNITED STATES TALK ABOUT

398
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
YOUR SISTER AS A HERO, IT MUST

399
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
HAVE BEEN VERY MOVING TO YOU.

400
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
>> IT WAS VERY MUCH.

401
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I APPRECIATE ALL HIS KIND WORDS

402
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
THAT HE DID SAY ABOUT MY SISTER.

403
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
SHE WAS A HERO, AND SHE STILL

404
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
IS.

405
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
>> WHAT KIND OF PERSON WAS SHE,

406
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
CARLEE?
>> SHE WAS SO CARING.

407
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
SHE PUT ANYBODY ELSE BEFORE HER.

408
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
SHE WANTED THE BEST FOR

409
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
EVERYONE.

410
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
SHE JUST LOVED LIFE, AND SHE

411
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
LOVED TEACHING.

412
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
>> AND JILLIAN, YOU'RE ALL

413
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
WEARING GREEN BECAUSE THAT WAS

414
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
VICKI'S FAVORITE COLOR, AND I

415
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
HEARD YOU SAY THIS MORNING THAT

416
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
WHEN IT SNOWED, YOU FELT IT WAS

417
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
IN SOME WAY A SIGNAL FROM YOUR

418
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
SISTER.

419
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
>> IT WAS.

420
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
IT'S LIKE HER LOOKING DOWN AT US

421
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
AND LETTING US KNOW THAT SHE'S

422
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
HERE WITH US AND SHE LOVED THE

423
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY.
SHE LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT,

424
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
THE SNOW THAT COMES WITH IT, SO

425
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
WHEN IT STARTED TO HAIL, THE

426
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
THREE OF US KNEW IT WAS OUR

427
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
SISTER SAYING THAT I'M HERE WITH

428
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
YOU GUYS, EVEN THROUGH ALL OF

429
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
THIS.

430
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
GREEN IS HER FAVORITE COLOR.

431
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
>> I'M SORRY.

432
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
>> WE JUST WANTED TO WEAR THE

433
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
GREEN TO SHOW HOW MUCH WE LOVE

434
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
HER AND HONOR HER FOR IT.

435
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
>> CARLOS, YOU WERE VICKI'S

436
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
BROTHER.
WHEN YOU HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED

437
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
AT THE SCHOOL, IT MUST HAVE

438
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
BEEN, I IMAGINE, THE WORST

439
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE.

440
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
TRY AND SUM UP FOR ME WHAT IT'S

441
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
BEEN LIKE FOR YOU AS A FAMILY

442
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
SINCE THIS DREADFUL, DREADFUL

443
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
MOMENT HAPPENED.

444
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
>> IT'S JUST BEEN HORRIBLE.

445
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
THERE'S BEEN SO MANY PEOPLE HERE

446
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
TO SUPPORT US, AND I REALLY

447
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
THINK THAT SHE WANTED US TO COME

448
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
BACK TOGETHER.
AND WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN CLOSE, BUT

449
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
SHE'S JUST GOING TO BRING US

450
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
CLOSER, AND I KNOW WE'LL ALWAYS

451
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
REMEMBER HER FOR THIS.

452
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
>> AND CARLOS, HOW DO YOU FEEL

453
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
ABOUT THE WAY THE COMMUNITY HAS

454
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
RALLIED TOGETHER?
THE PRESIDENT NOTICED THIS,

455
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
YOU'VE COME TOGETHER AS A

456
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
COMMUNITY, NOT JUST THOSE WHO

457
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
HAVE LOST PEOPLE, BUT JUST THE

458
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
WHOLE COMMUNITY.

459
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
AND YOU'VE BEEN JOINED BY

460
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
AMERICA, I THINK, THAT'S BEEN

461
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
SHATTERED BY WHAT'S HAPPENED,

462
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
FROM THE PRESIDENT DOWN.

463
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN

464
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
WITH NEWTOWN NOW?

465
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
HOW WILL THEY RECOVER FROM THIS?

466
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
>> I DON'T THINK IT WILL EVER BE

467
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
A FULL RECOVERY.

468
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I KNOW THAT THESE 27 PEOPLE THAT

469
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
LOST THEIR LIVES WILL BE

470
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
REMEMBERED AND WILL BE MISSED TO

471
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
THE FULLEST, AND I JUST -- IT'S

472
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
JUST SO THANKFUL TO KNOW THAT

473
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
EVERYONE IN STRATFORD HAS BEEN

474
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
TOUCHED BY HER LIFE SOMEHOW AND

475
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
CAME HERE TO CELEBRATE HER LIFE.

476
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
>> I UNDERSTAND, DONNA, THAT

477
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
CARLEE MET WITH THE PRESIDENT

478
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
TODAY.
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT?

479
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
>> WE ALL MET WITH THE PRESIDENT

480
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
TODAY.

481
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
IT WAS -- HE WAS VERY, VERY

482
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
CARING AND VERY SUPPORTIVE AND

483
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
TOLD US HE KNEW ALL ABOUT VICKI

484
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
AND WHAT SHE DID AND WHAT A HERO

485
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
SHE WAS.

486
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
AND SHE WAS JUST VERY, VERY KIND

487
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
TO US AND GAVE US THE TIME WE

488
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
NEEDED WITH HIM, AND IT WAS --

489
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
IT WAS VERY COMFORTING.

490
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
>> AND JAMES, YOU WERE VICKI'S

491
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
COUSIN, YOU'RE ALSO A POLICE

492
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
OFFICER.
IT WAS VERY NOTICEABLE IN THE

493
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH TONIGHT THAT

494
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
HE SEEMS, ALTHOUGH HE NEVER

495
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
MENTIONED THE WORD GUNS, HE'S

496
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
DETERMINED TO DO WHATEVER HE

497
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
CAN, HE SAID, TO TRY AND PREVENT

498
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
ANOTHER SHOOTING TRAGEDY LIKE

499
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
THIS.
AND MANY ARE TAKING THIS TO MEAN

500
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
GUN CONTROL, WHATEVER IT MAY BE.

501
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION AS A

502
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
POLICEMAN TO WHAT HE WAS SAYING

503
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
THERE?

504
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
>> I GOT TO BE HONEST, I DIDN'T

505
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
SEE OR HEAR HIS SPEECH YET.

506
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
WE -- AFTER WE MET WITH HIM, HE

507
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
WAS JUST LOVE AND SUPPORT FROM

508
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
HIM WAS COMFORTING FOR THE

509
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
FAMILY.
I GOT THE FAMILY BACK HERE TO

510
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
STRATFORD.
TO TRY AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,

511
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
JUST AS ANY OTHER ISSUE, I WOULD

512
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
HAVE TO SAY AWARENESS,

513
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
AWARENESS, AWARENESS.

514
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
FRIENDS, FAMILY, GUN SUPPORTERS,

515
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
PEOPLE THAT OPPOSE GUNS, JUST

516
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
AWARENESS.

517
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
AND BEING AWARE OF YOUR

518
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
SURROUNDINGS.

519
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
>> I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL

520
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
FOR --

521
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO
SAY.

522
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
>> LISTEN, I DON'T WANT TO PRESS

523
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
YOU ON THIS.

524
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
IT'S NOT THE TIME FOR YOU AS A

525
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
FAMILY TO CONSIDER THESE THINGS.

526
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
IT WILL BE FOR THE PRESIDENT AND

527
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
POLITICIANS, I THINK, TO DO WHAT

528
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

529
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR

530
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
TAKING THE TIME TO JOIN ME THIS

531
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
EVENING AND JUST TO SEND YOU ON

532
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
BEHALF OF EVERYONE AT CNN AND

533
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
AMERICA THAT'S BEEN THINKING OF
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

534
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
VICKI WAS A HEROINE, TRUE

535
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
AMERICAN, YOUR LOSS IS APPALLING

536
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
BUT HER LEGACY AND MEMORY WILL

537
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
LIVE ON FOR A VERY, VERY LONG

538
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
TIME.
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

539
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.

540
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
>> BRAVE FAMILY.

541
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I WANT TO BRING YOU WOLF

542
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
BLITZER, WHO'S ON THE SCENE OF

543
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
TONIGHT'S VIGIL.

544
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
WOLF, IT'S A PRETTY UNBEARABLE

545
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
STORY, THIS, TO COVER.

546
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
YOU CAN ONLY BEGIN TO IMAGINE

547
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
WHAT ON EARTH THESE FAMILIES ARE

548
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
GOING THROUGH.

549
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE

550
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH TONIGHT?

551
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
VERY EMOTIONAL, PRETTY

552
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
DETERMINED, AND ALTHOUGH HE

553
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
DIDN'T MENTION THE WORD GUNS,

554
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
PRETTY OBVIOUS, I THINK, HE'S

555
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000

736
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
WATCHING VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES,

737
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
BUT HERE'S MY QUESTION.

738
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
IN ALL YOUR EXPERIENCE, IF

739
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
SOMEBODY IS MENTALLY ILL,

740
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
MENTALLY UNSTABLE, VULNERABLE,

741
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
IF YOU LIKE, AND THEY ARE

742
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
WATCHING VERY VIOLENT VIDEO

743
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
GAMES A LOT, CAN IT STIMULATE

744
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
THEM, DOES IT DESENSITIZE THEM,

745
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
CAN IT BE PART OF THE

746
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
PROVOCATION, IF YOU LIKE, FOR

747
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
MAKING THEM GO AND DO AN

748
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
ATROCITY?

749
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S PART OF
THE PROVOCATION.

750
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
LET ME SAY SOMETHING.

751
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL

752
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
ILLNESS, DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE

753
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
MENTALLY UNSTABLE.

754
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN

755
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
TREATMENT WITH SERIOUS MENTAL

756
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
ILLNESSES LIKES ABERGER'S,

757
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
SCHIZOPHRENIA, BIPOLAR, ARE

758
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
STABLE, LIVING PRODUCTIVE LIVES,

759
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
ARE WORKING.

760
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT

761
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
THAT.
WHAT HAPPENS, I LOOK AT THAT

762
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
RESEARCH FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

763
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO BAN --

764
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
>> COLUMBINE ALSO.

765
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
>> THE HEADLINE IS THAT, YES,

766
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
WHEN YOU'RE ENGAGED IN, YOU

767
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
KNOW, VERY VIVID VIDEOS WHERE

768
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
YOU'RE SHOOTING PEOPLE, KILLING

769
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
PEOPLE, WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE

770
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
DESENSITIZED TO WHAT IT MEANS TO

771
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
PULL A TRIGGER.

772
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
CERTAINLY, THE SCIENCE THERE IS

773
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
VERY GOOD, BUT A LOT OF THAT

774
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
RESEARCH IS FLAWED IN THAT

775
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
PEOPLE ARE SELECTED NOT -- YOU

776
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
CAN'T KNOW AHEAD OF TIME IF THE

777
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE DRAWN TO THESE

778
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
GAMES ARE ALREADY PEOPLE PRONE

779
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
TO VIOLENCE AND AGGRESSION,

780
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
REGARDLESS OF THE ISSUE OF

781
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
MENTAL ILLNESS.

782
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
>> PEOPLE WHO PLAY THESE GAMES

783
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
ARE PERFECTLY NORMAL, WHATEVER

784
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
NORMAL MEANS THESE DAYS, AND IT

785
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
HAS NO AFFECT ON THEM, I TOTALLY

786
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
ACCEPT THAT.
ANOTHER ARGUMENT THAT'S BEEN

787
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
RAISING, MORGAN FREEMAN, THE

788
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
ACTOR, BLAMED THE MEDIA FOR ALL

789
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
OF THIS, COPYCAT SYNDROME, THE

790
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
MEDIA, BY MAKING AS HE PUT IT

791
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
ALMOST LIKE GROTESQUE HEROS OF

792
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
THESE PEOPLE BY CONSTANTLY

793
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
NAMING THEM, SOMEHOW PROPAGATE

794
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
THIS ONGOING SITUATION WITH SO

795
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
MANY MASS SHOOTINGS.

796
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
DO YOU THINK HE'S RIGHT?

797
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I MEAN, I DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM

798
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
RULING OUT GUN CONTROL --

799
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
>> I DON'T THINK HE'S RIGHT.

800
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
>> IS HE RIGHT?
>> NO, HE'S NOT.

801
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'LL BLAME THE MEDIA FOR ONE

802
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
THING ONLY, WHICH IS

803
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
RETRAUMATIZING US.

804
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
DO YOU REMEMBER WITH 9/11 THERE
WAS A CALL FOR THE MEDIA TO STOP

805
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
SHOWING THE JETS FLYING INTO THE

806
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
BUILDINGS, BECAUSE PSYCHOLOGISTS

807
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
LIKE MYSELF AND OTHERS WERE

808
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
SEEING OUR PATIENTS HAVING VIVID

809
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
FLASHBACKS, NIGHTMARES,

810
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER

811
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
REACTION.
EXCESSIVE COVERAGE OF THIS CAN

812
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
BE TRAUMATIZING.

813
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'VE LOOKED AT PICTURES OF DEAD

814
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
CHILDREN AND BABIES IN THE CASES

815
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'VE WORKED ON AND HAD

816
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
NIGHTMARES.
ONE CASE IN PARTICULAR I STILL

817
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
HAVE FLASHBACKS TO JUST LOOKING

818
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
AT PICTURES, BUT NO, IT DOESN'T

819
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
CAUSE THIS KIND OF THING.

820
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
CAN I SAY ONE THING REALLY,

821
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
REALLY CLEARLY THAT I ONLY

822
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
TOUCHED ON ON FRIDAY, YOUR

823
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
CHANCES OF BEING SHOT AND KILLED

824
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
IN A MASS SHOOTING LIKE THIS ARE

825
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
ACTUALLY LESS THAN BEING STRUCK

826
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
BY LIGHTNING.
I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULDN'T

827
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
COVER THIS AND TALK ABOUT THIS,

828
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY, MORGAN

829
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
FREEMAN, THIS IS NOT CAUSING --

830
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
>> I'M HEARING APPARENTLY MORGAN

831
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
FREEMAN HAS COME OUT AND SAID

832
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
IT'S A HOAX, ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN

833
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
RUNNING ALL OVER THE MEDIA FOR

834
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
THE LAST 24 HOURS.

835
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
IT MAY BE A HOAX, AS HE APPEARS

836
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
TO NOW BE CLARIFYING.

837
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
EITHER WAY, THOUGH, IT'S A

838
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
DEBATE A LOT OF PEOPLE I'VE BEEN

839
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
SEEING ON TWITTER, CNN ANCHORS,

840
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
ANDERSON COOPER AND OTHERS THINK

841
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
YOU SHOULDN'T BE NAMING.

842
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE SHOULD BE

843
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
THINKING ABOUT QUITE CAREFULLY.

844
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
>> IT IS A VALID THING TO BE

845
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
THINKING ABOUT, BUT THEN YOU

846
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
TURN TO THE RESEARCH, IF YOU

847
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
HAVE VIABLE RESEARCH TO LOOK AT,

848
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
YOU CAN LOOK AT EXPERTS WHO CAN

849
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
ASSESS THE TRUTHFULNESS OF THE

850
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
CONCLUSIONS.
WE DON'T SEE THAT COVERAGE LIKE

851
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
THIS CAUSES VIOLENCE.

852
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
>> FINAL QUESTION, EVERYBODY

853
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
WANTS TO KNOW THE SAME THING,

854
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
WHY WOULD A 20-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO

855
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
JUST SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE BIT

856
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
OF A LONER, LITTLE BIT STRANGE,

857
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
BUT NOTHING DANGEROUS AT ALL,

858
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
WHY WOULD HE GO TO A SCHOOL AND

859
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
KILL 20, 5, 6, 7-YEAR-OLD KIDS?

860
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
>> THE PERSON THAT HAS THE

861
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
ANSWER MAINLY IS ADAM.

862
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
ONE THING WE KNOW IS PEOPLE WITH

863
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
MENTAL ILLNESSES AND PEOPLE WHO

864
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
DON'T HAVE MENTAL ILLNESSES WHO

865
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
DO THESE THINGS ISOLATE

866
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
THEMSELVES FIRST.
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BUILD

867
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
BRIDGES TO THESE PEOPLE.

868
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I TELL YOU WHAT, THE PEOPLE WHO

869
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
ARE VIOLENT AND ARE PRONE TO

870
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
SUICIDE, IN MY FIELD, WE PREVENT

871
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ALL THE

872
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
TIME WHEN WE BUILD A

873
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PERSON.

874
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
THEY WILL TALK TO ME, YOU KNOW

875
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
WHAT, DOC, I'M SO ANGRY I'M

876
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
THINKING ABOUT KILLING MY

877
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
MOTHER.

878
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
>> HIS COMPUTER HARD DRIVE THE

879
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
FBI HAVE.

880
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
>>> WHEN WE COME BACK, WHAT TO

881
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
DO ABOUT GUNS.

882
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
IT'S TRULY A QUESTION ABOUT LIFE

883
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
AND DEATH AND FEELINGS ON BOTH

884
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
SIDES ARE VERY MOTIVE.

885
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'LL TALK TO BOTH SIDES AFTER

886
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
THE BREAK.

887
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
AMERICANS ARE ALWAYSO
WORK HARD FOR A BETTER FUTURE.

888
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
SINCE AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL
WAS FOUNDED BACK IN 1894,

889
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
THEY'VE BEEN COMMITTED
TO PUTTING CLIENTS FIRST.

890
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
HELPING GENERATIONS
THROUGH TOUGH TIMES.

891

GOOD TIMES.

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
THERE WHEN YOU NEED THEM.

894
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
HELPING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
OVER THE CENTURIES.

895
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
THE STRENGTH OF
A GLOBAL FINANCIAL LEADER.

896
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
THE HEART OF
A ONE-TO-ONE RELATIONSHIP.

897
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
TOGETHER FOR YOUR FUTURE.

901
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
IS THE FOURTH TIME WE HAVE COME

902
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
TOGETHER TO COMFORT A GRIEVING

903

910
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
AN ENDLESS SERIES OF DEADLY

911
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
SHOOTINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

912
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000

THE QUESTION REMAINS WHAT

917
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
AMERICA SHOULD DO ABOUT GUNS.

918
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
PRESIDENT OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN

919
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE AND THE

920
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
ATTORNEY FOR THE MICHIGAN

921
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
COALITION FOR RESPONSIBLE GUN

922
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
OWNERS.
I WANT YOUR REACTION, FIRST OF

923
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
ALL, DAN GROSS, WHAT DO YOU MAKE

924
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
OF HOW THE PRESIDENT SAID, AND

925
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
HOW SERIOUS DO YOU THINK HE IS

926
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
ABOUT ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING

927
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
RATHER THAN JUST WORDS?

928
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
>> WE'RE INSPIRED.

929
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I MEAN, WE'RE INSPIRED TO TAKE

930
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
HIM AT HIS WORD.

931
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
THE PRESIDENT, SINCE THIS HAS

932
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
HAPPENED, HAS CALLED FOR

933
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
MEANINGFUL ACTION.

934
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
HE'S SAYING ALL THE RIGHT

935
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
THINGS, AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT

936
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
ALL THE RIGHT THINGS.

937
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
IT'S UP TO US, THE AMERICAN

938
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
PUBLIC NOW, INCLUDING ALL THE

939
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
VICTIMS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED

940
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
BY THESE TRAGEDIES, TO MAKE SURE

941
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
HE DOES TAKE THAT ACTION.

942
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
THOSE ARE THE DOTS THAT NEED TO

943
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
BE CONNECTED.
THIS IS THE TIME.

944
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
CHANGE HAS TO HAPPEN.

945
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
AND THIS REALLY IS A PIVOTAL

946
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THIS

947
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
ISSUE, AND YOU CAN JUST SENSE IT

948
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
WATCHING THIS TONIGHT AND SEEING

949
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
HOW THAT COMMUNITY IS GRIEVING

950
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
AND KNOWING HOW OUR WHOLE NATION

951
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
IS GRIEVING.

952
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
WE DO THINK THIS IS A TIME FOR

953
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
CHANGE AND WE DO THINK PRESIDENT

954
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
OBAMA IS GOING TO LEAD US IN THE

955
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
RIGHT DIRECTION.
>> STEVE, THE NATURE OF THIS

956
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
DEBATE, I THINK, NEEDS TO BE

957
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
CRYSTALLIZED AND CLARIFIED.

958
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
TOO MANY PEOPLE ON EACH SIDES

959
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
TAKE POSITIONS AND PUT WORDS IN

960
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
THE MOUTH OF THEIR OPPONENTS.

961
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
YOU THE REALITY IS THIS, NOBODY

962
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
IS SUGGESTING A BAN ON ALL GUNS

963
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
IN AMERICA.
THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS

964
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
ABSOLUTELY PART OF AMERICAN

965
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
CULTURE AND PEOPLE BELIEVE IN

966
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
IT.
HOWEVER, THERE ARE LIMITATIONS.

967
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
THE AMENDMENT TALKS ABOUT A

968
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
WELL-REGULATED  ED MILITIA.

969
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
PEOPLE ARE CALLING OUT FOR

970
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
TAKING SOME OF THESE WEAPONS

971
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
AWAY FROM PEOPLE WITH POTENTIAL

972
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
MENTAL ISSUES.

973
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
TO ME, THE QUESTION FOR YOU IS

974
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
THIS, THE LAST THREE MASS

975
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
SHOOTINGS IN THE LAST FOUR

976
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
MONTHS IN AMERICA, AURORA,

977
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
OREGON IN THE SHOPPING MALL AND

978
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
NOW HERE IN NEWTOWN HAVE

979
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
INVOLVED YOUNG PEOPLE USING THE

980
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
SAME WEAPON, AR-15

981
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE WITH

982
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES.

983
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
IN AURORA, OVER 100 IN HIS

984
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
MAGAZINE, WHICH HE COULD FIRE

985
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
OFF, AND HERE WE SAW UP TO 30,

986
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
BUT A LOT OF MAGAZINES.

987
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
HERE'S THE QUESTION, WHY DO YOU

988
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
FEEL THAT AMERICANS SHOULD HAVE

989
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
THOSE IF YOUR BELIEF IS THEY

990
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
JUST HAVE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES?

991
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
>> WELL, BEFORE I GO ANY

992
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
FURTHER, PIERS, FIRST, THANKS

993
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
FOR HAVING ME BACK.

994
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
WE DID HAVE A HEATED DISCUSSION

995
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
LAST TIME AND I MUCH APPRECIATE

996
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
THIS MORE CALM DISCUSSION.

997
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
SECOND, ON BEHALF OF I'M SURE I

998
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE BOARD OF

999
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
MICHIGAN COALITION OF

1000
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS WE OFFER

1001
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
OUR CONDOLENCES FOR THE VICTIMS

1002
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
OF THE FAMILIES.

1003
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
WE ARE ALL ABOUT SAFETY.

1004
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
WE ALL WANT TO BE SAFE AND WE

1005
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
CERTAINLY WANT CHILDREN TO BE

1006
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
SAFE.

1007
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
LIKE I SAID LAST WEEK, WE JUST

1008
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
DISAGREE ON HOW TO GET THERE

1009
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
FROM HERE.
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I WOULD

1010
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
POINT OUT THAT THE SHOOTER IN

1011
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
THE MALL IN OREGON WAS

1012
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
CONFRONTED BY A LEGALLY ARMED

1013
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
CITIZEN WHO POINTED HIS GUN AT

1014
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
THE SHOOTER AND THEN DECIDED NOT

1015
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
TO SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER BECAUSE

1016
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
HE WAS AFRAID OF MISSING AND

1017
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
HITTING BYSTANDERS.

1018
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
HE WAS ACTING VERY RESPONSIBLY.

1019
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
AND THE NEXT SHOT THAT THAT

1020
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
SHOOTER FIRED, THAT THE KILLER

1021
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
FIRED, WAS ON HIMSELF AFTER HE

1022
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
WAS CONFRONTED WITH AN ARMED

1023
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
CITIZEN.
SO THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE EXAMPLE

1024
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
OF A RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNER USING

1025
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
A GUN TO SAVE LIVES.

1026
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
>> WELL, HE ACTUALLY DIDN'T USE

1027
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
THE GUN.

1028
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I THINK THE POINT, DAN, UNLESS

1029
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'M MISTAKEN.

1030
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
YOU TAKE IT UP HERE.

1031
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
BUT I DON'T THINK ANY AMERICAN

1032
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
CITIZEN WITH A LEGAL GUN HAS

1033
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
EVER INTERVENED IN A MASS

1034
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
SHOOTING, CERTAINLY NOT IN THE

1035
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
LAST 30 OR 40 YEARS IN AMERICA.

1036
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
>> ACTUALLY, THEY HAVE.

1037
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
>> BEFORE THIS EVOLVES INTO AN

1038
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
ARGUMENT, I MEAN, AS EASY AS IT

1039
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
IS TO BECOME UNINSPIRED BY A

1040
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
CONVERSATION LIKE THIS AND WHAT

1041
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
YOUR OTHER GUEST IS SAYING, I

1042
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
JUST ENCOURAGE THE AMERICAN

1043
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
PEOPLE TO NOT LOSE THE SENSE OF

1044
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
INSPIRATION IN TERMS OF THE

1045
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
CHANGE THAT WE HAVE THE

1046
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
POTENTIAL TO ACCOMPLISH.

1047
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
THIS IS NOT THE CONVERSATION

1048
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WANT TO

1049
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
HAVE.
THIS IS NOT OUR VISION WHERE THE

1050
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
ANSWER TO VIOLENCE IS MORE

1051
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
VIOLENCE, WHERE THE ANSWER TO

1052
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
GUNS IS MORE GUNS.

1053
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
THERE IS FERTILE GROUND WHERE

1054
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

1055
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
AMERICANS AGREE WITH THINGS LIKE

1056
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS TO MAKE SURE

1057
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
THAT 40% OF ALL GUN SALES THAT

1058
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
ARE NOT CURRENTLY COVERED BY

1059
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS TO PREVENT

1060
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE FROM GETTING

1061
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
GUNS, TO PREVENT CRIMINALS AND

1062
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
DOMESTIC ABUSERS FROM GETTING

1063
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
GUNS, TO CLOSE THAT GAPING HOLE

1064
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
IN OUR SYSTEM.

1065
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
GUN OWNERS, 74% OF NRA MEMBERS

1066
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
SUPPORT SOLUTIONS LIKE THAT.

1067
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES THIS

1068
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
PLAYS OUT AS A POLARIZED

1069
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
POLITICAL DEBATE IN SEGMENTS

1070
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
LIKE THE ONE I WAS PART OF ALSO

1071
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
ON FRIDAY NIGHT, BUT THE REALITY

1072
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
IS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ISN'T

1073
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
POLARIZED.
THE ONLY PLACE THIS IS A

1074
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
POLARIZED POLITICAL DEBATE IS IN

1075
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
CONGRESS.
WE NEED TO TAKE THE VOICE OF THE

1076
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO KNOW THAT,

1077
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
AS PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID TONIGHT,

1078
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
WE CAN BE BETTER THAN THIS AND

1079
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
HOLD OUR LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE.

1080
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
>> VERY INTERESTING TO ME.

1081
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
THIS IS ALMOST A MIRROR TRAGEDY

1082
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN BRITAIN IN

1083
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
1996 AND SCOTLAND, 16 YOUNG 5

1084
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
AND 6-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN WERE

1085
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
KILLED.

1086
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
IT WAS THE WORST SHOOTING OF ITS

1087
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
TYPE IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY,

1088
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
AND AS A RESULT, A FULL HANDGUN

1089
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
BAN WAS BROUGHT IN.

1090
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
WHICH WOULD NOT BE APPLICABLE

1091
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
HERE, THERE ARE TOO MANY IN

1092
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
CIRCULATION.
BUT WHAT WAS MOST NOTABLE ABOUT

1093
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
THE DEBATE, IT WAS COMPLETELY

1094
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
NON-POLITICAL.

1095
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
MY QUESTION FOR YOU, STEVE, IS

1096
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO BE

1097
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
POLITICAL?
WHY CAN IT NOT JUST BE A

1098
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
BIPARTISAN, ALL ENCOMPASSING,

1099
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
AMERICAN DIALOGUE, WHICH LEADS

1100
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
IN THE END TO PRAGMATIC
SOLUTION?

1101
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
>> I AGREE WITH YOUR LAST

1102
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
STATEMENT, ABSOLUTELY, PIERS.

1103
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
IN FACT, OUR GROUP IS A SINGLE

1104
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
ISSUE NON-PARTISAN GROUP.

1105
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
WE HAVE INDEPENDENTS, DEMOCRATS,

1106
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
AND REPUBLICANS IN OUR GROUP AND

1107
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
ON MEMBERSHIP, MOST ARE ELECTED

1108
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
OFFICIALS.
WE ACTUALLY DO TAKE THAT

1109
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
POSITION.

1110
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
>> DO YOU AGREE WITH UNIVERSAL

1111
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS?

1112
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
>> UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS?

1113
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE CRIMINAL

1114
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
BACKGROUND CHECK IN PLACE.

1115
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
>> RIGHT, BUT THAT ONLY APPLIES

1116
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
TO 60% OF GUN SALES.

1117
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
DO YOU AGREE WITH COVERING THE

1118
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
OTHER 40% OF GUN SALES WITH

1119
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS?

1120
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
>> WE AGREE THAT DISQUALIFIED

1121
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
INDIVIDUALS SHOULD NOT HAVE

1122
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
ACCESS TO FIREARMS.

1123
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
>> SO YOU AGREE WITH THE

1124
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS --

1125
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
>> ARE YOU GOING TO LET ME

1126
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
FINISH?

1127
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
PLEASE, PLEASE.
>> LET ME ASK YOU, GIVE ME ONE

1128
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
GOOD REASON WHY THERE SHOULDN'T

1129
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
BE 100% BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ALL

1130
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
GUN TRANSACTIONS IN AMERICA.

1131
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
GIVE ME A GOOD REASON.

1132
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
>> IT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE,

1133
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
PIERS, AS YOU POINTED OUT A

1134
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
MOMENT AGO, TO DO 100%.

1135
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
WE HAVE A LOT OF GUNS IN

1136
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
CIRCULATION ON EARTH AND IN THE

1137
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
UNITED STATES.
WE KNOW THAT GUNS PASS ACROSS

1138
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
BORDERS.
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEW ONES.

1139
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
>> NATIONAL AND STATE BORDERS.

1140
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
>> LET ME FOCUS THE QUESTION

1141
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
MORE SOLIDLY AND REALISTICALLY.

1142
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
NEW GUNS PURCHASED FROM THIS DAY

1143
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
FORWARD, WOULD YOU BE SUPPORTIVE

1144
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
OF 100% REGISTRATION,

1145
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
ACCOUNTABILITY, DATABASE, A

1146
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
NATIONAL DATABASE, AND IF YOU'RE

1147
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
NOT IN FAVOR OF THAT, WHY

1148
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
WOULDN'T YOU BE?

1149
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
>> OR AS CLOSE AS WE CAN GET TO

1150
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
100%, WHICH IS A LOT CLOSER THAN

1151
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
WHERE WE ARE NOW.

1152
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
>> THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN PLACE

1153
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
RIGH

1154
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
RIGHT NOW IS A LIST OF THOSE

1155
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
DISQUALIFIED.

1156
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
PERSONALLY, I WOULD SUPPORT THAT

1157
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
BASED ON EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN

1158
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
ABLE TO LEARN IN MY POSITION AS

1159
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
PROFESSOR OF FIREARMS LAW AND IN

1160
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
MY POSITION AS A TRAINER OF

1161
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
CONCEALED PISTOL LICENSES THAT

1162
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
NATIONAL INSTANT CHECK SYSTEM

1163
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
SEEMS TO BE WORKING QUITE WELL.

1164
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I BELIEVE THAT'S ONE AREA

1165
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
EVERYONE AGREES.

1166
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
>> WE SHOULD APPLY TO 100% OF

1167
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
GUN SALES?

1168
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
>> WE HAVE A LIST OF FOLKS WHO

1169
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
ARE DISQUALIFIED WHO HAVE BEEN

1170
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
ADJUDICATED MENTALLY ILL, FELONY

1171
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
RECORDS THAT DISQUALIFY THEM, ET

1172
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
CETERA.
THAT SYSTEM SEEMS TO WORK QUITE

1173
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
WELL.
>> FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU,

1174
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
STEVE, IS THIS.
IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THE LAST

1175
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
THREE MASS SHOOTINGS, AS I SAID,

1176
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
ALL FEATURED AN AR-15 RIFLE

1177
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
AIDED AND ABETTED BY

1178
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES, GIVE ME

1179
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
A REASON WHY YOU ARE COMFORTABLE

1180
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
WITH THOSE WEAPONS STILL BEING

1181
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH

1182
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES IN

1183
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
AMERICA IN PLACES LIKE WALMART.

1184
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
>> FAIR ENOUGH.

1185
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
AND I DON'T KNOW ANY PARTICULAR

1186
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
RETAILER, BUT I WILL SAY WE DID

1187
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
TRY FROM 1994 TO 2004, WE TRIED

1188
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
THE SO-CALLED ASSAULT WEAPONS

1189
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
BAN.

1190
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
IT HAD NO IMPACT ON CRIME THAT

1191
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
ANYONE COULD MEASURE WHATSOEVER,

1192
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
AND THE TRUTH IS SOMETIMES THESE

1193
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
GUNS ARE USED IN VERY POSITIVE

1194
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
WAYS TO SAVE LIVES.

1195
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
THEY ARE FUNCTIONALLY IDENTICAL

1196
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
TO SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS THAT

1197
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
DATE BACK LITERALLY TO THE

1198
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
1800s.

1199
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
A HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINE IS

1200
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
NOTHING BUT A STEEL BOX AND A

1201
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
SPRING.

1202
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
IT'S INCREDIBLY EASY TO MAKE A

1203
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINE.

1204
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
THE TRUTH IS THAT ANY SUCH BAN

1205
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
WOULD BE INEFFECTIVE.

1206
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
>> THIS IS TOTALLY DISCONNECTED

1207
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
WITH WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

1208
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
WANT AND THE CONVERSATION THAT'S

1209
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
HAPPENING OUT THERE, AND THAT'S

1210
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
WHAT GIVES ME INSPIRATION TO

1211
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS

1212
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
LIKE THIS.

1213
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC KNOWS WE ARE

1214
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
BETTER THAN THIS.

1215
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
WE DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A

1216
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
SOCIETY WHERE VIOLENCE LEADS TO

1217
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
MORE VIOLENT AND GUNS LEAD TO

1218
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
MORE GUNS.

1219
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
THAT'S THE CONVERSATION
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS LEADING AND

1220
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO

1221
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
SPEAK UP AROUND.
>> GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE.

1222
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
>> WE ALL AGREE WE NEED SAFETY.

1223
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
>> WE'RE ALL AGREED ON THAT.

1224
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
WE WILL CONTINUE THIS DEBATE ON

1225
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
THE SHOW.
IT'S BEEN AN IMPORTANT ONE FOR

1226
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
AMERICA.
THANK YOU BOTH.

1227
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
>>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID WE

1228
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
CAN'T TOLERATE THIS ANYMORE, BUT

1229
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
WILL THERE BE A CHANGE IN

1230
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
POLICY?

1231
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I'LL ASK FRANK BRUNEY AFTER THE
BREAK.

1232
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000

YES, IT IS.

THAT'S THE COLD TRUTH!

EARLIER THIS YEAR?

MOST OF THE PEOPLE WERE INJURED

1260

WITH POLICE BULLETS.

1261
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
IF POLICE OFFICERS CAN'T FIRE

1262
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
WITH ACCURACY, WHY WOULD WE

1263
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
BELIEVE THAT TEACHERS IN SCHOOLS

1264
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
WOULD HAVE WONDERFUL MARKS

1265

THIS A BETTER THING.

00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000

IT CANNOT BE TRUE.

1273
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000

>> AND WE HAVE THE MOST GUN

1276
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
RELATED DEATHS.

1277
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
>> TWICE AS MANY AS ANYBODY

1278
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
ELSE.

1279
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
AND THE PENNY DOESN'T SEEM TO

1280
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
DROP WITH PEOPLE.

1281
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
>> NO, I MEAN YOU HAD DAN GROSS

1282
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
ON.
I MET HIM IN 1997 WHEN AT

1283
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
ANOTHER EMPIRE STATE SHOOTING,

1284
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
HIS BROTHER WAS HORRIBLY

1285
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
WOUNDED.
I HADN'T SEEN DAN UNTIL NOW.

1286
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
THAT WAS 1997.

1287
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
VERY BEEN WRITING ON AND OFF

1288
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL SINCE THEN.

1289
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
SINCE THEN, STATES HAVE GOTTEN

1290
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
MORE LAX, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

1291
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
HASN'T DONE ANYTHING.

1292
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE WE'RE

1293
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
GOING TO SEE WHAT WE'RE MADE OF.

1294
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I FEEL THERE'S A DEGREE OF

1295
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
HEARTBREAK AND A LEVEL OF

1296
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
OUTRAGE THAT IS BIGGER THAN I'VE

1297
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
EVER SEEN.
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT IF WE'RE

1298
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
WILLING TO DO SOMETHING.

1299
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
>> I AGREE, ONE OF THE REASONS

1300
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS

1301
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
EMOTIONAL ABOUT THIS NOW, SINCE

1302
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
HE'S BEEN PRESIDENT, THIS IS THE

1303
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
FOURTH TIME HE'S TALKED IN FRONT

1304
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
OF A COMMUNITY TORN APART BY

1305
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
SHOOTINGS.

1306
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
THIS IS BORDERING ON AN

1307
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
EPIDEMIC, SOMETHING HAS TO

1308
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
HAPPEN.
>> IT'S NOT BORDERING ANY MORE,

1309
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
IT IS.
>> IT IS AN EPIDEMIC.

1310
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
>> I THINK SOMETHING WILL

1311
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
CHANGE.
FOR THE FIRST TIME OUT OF THIS

1312
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
MISERY, I FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF

1313
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
HOPE.
I WATCHED YOUR SHOW FRIDAY, THE

1314
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
AMOUNT OF OUTRAGE IN YOUR VOICE

1315
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
WAS HIGHER THAN I HAD EVER

1316
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
SCENE.

1317
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I THOUGHT ABOUT "SATURDAY NIGHT

1318
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
LIVE" LAST NIGHT, WITH THAT

1319
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
RENDITION OF "SILENT NIGHT."

1320
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
WE DON'T KNOW THAT SOME OF THE

1321
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
THINGS BEING PROPOSED ARE THE

1322
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
RIGHT ANSWERS.
THE PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT

1323
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
TONIGHT.

1324
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
HE SAID CAUSES ARE COMPLEX.

1325
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO TRY.

1326
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I THINK THOSE ARE KEY WORDS.

1327
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
WHETHER SOMETHING IS GOING TO

1328
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
WORK OR NOT.

1329
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
WE CAN'T JUST SAY, OH, THE

1330
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN DIDN'T WORK

1331
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
SO WELL, LET'S NOT TRY SOMETHING

1332
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
LIKE IT AGAIN.

1333
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO TRY.

1334
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
THERE ARE ALL THESE DEAD

1335
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT GOING TO

1336
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
LIVE TO SEE TOMORROW.

1337
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
WE OWE THEM OUR BEST EFFORT EVEN

1338
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
IF IT'S A FLAWED EFFORT.

1339
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
>> YOU HAVE THE MENTAL HEALTH

1340
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
ISSUES, I THINK AMERICANS ARE

1341
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH.

1342
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS SUFFER

1343
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
WITH MENTAL ILLNESS.

1344
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER SYSTEM.

1345
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
ON GUNS, IT HAS TO BE A SPECIFIC

1346
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
DEBATE.
IT'S NO GOOD SAYING GUNS ARE

1347
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
GONE.
THERE'S TOO MANY OF THEM OUT

1348
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
THERE.

1349
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN, I DON'T

1350
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
THINK IT WAS AS INEFFECTUAL AS

1351
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
THE GUN LOBBY WOULD LIKE US TO

1352
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
BELIEVE.

1353
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
THE IDEA OF STOPPING AN ASSAULT

1354
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
WEAPON, ALLOWING THEM TO COME

1355
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
BACK IN.

1356
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
WHY DOES ANY YOUNG MAN IN

1357
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
AMERICA, OR WOMAN.

1358
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
BUT THEY'RE ALL MEN AT THE

1359
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
MOMENT.

1360
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
NEED ONE OF THESE AR-15 ASSAULT

1361
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
RIFLES, CAPABLE OF FIRING

1362
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
HUNDREDS OF BULLETS.

1363

>> OR THE HIGH CAPACITY CLIPS.

1364
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
YOU MENTIONED THAT EARLIER,

1365
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
WHICH I THINK IS KEY.

1366
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT ABOUT

1367
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
THE SECOND AMENDMENT SAYS TO US,

1368
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS

1369
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
TO THOSE.
WE CAN OUTLAW THEM, PUT

1370
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS IT

1371
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE GOING TO

1372
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
ENFORCE IT PERFECTLY.

1373
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
EVEN IF WE ENFORCE IT IN A

FLAWED FASHION THAT PREVENTS ONE

1375
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
OF THESE MASSACRES A YEAR OR

1376

FIVE DEATHS A YEAR.

1377
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
DON'T WE OWE IT TO THE COUNTRY

1378
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
TO TRY THAT?

1379
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
>> DO YOU THINK THE SCALE OF

1380
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW TOWN MEANS

1381
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
THIS IS THE TIPPING POINT?

1382
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
>> I THINK WHAT MAKES IT THE

1383
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
TIPPING POINT IS WHERE IT COMES

WHAT REALLY GOT TO PEOPLE.
