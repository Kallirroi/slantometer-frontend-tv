BUT ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD."

122
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
SOMEHOW IN THAT MOMENT BY GOD'S

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
GRACE WAS ABLE TO ACT AS IF SHE

124
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
WAS ALREADY DECEASED.

GRADERS, SHE WAS THE LONE
SURVIVOR.

130

138
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000

141
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
DOING?

142
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
>> I THINK AS WELL AS YOU CAN

143
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
EXPECT THEM TO DO.

144
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
>> AND THEY MUST BE RELIEVED TO

CALLED SURVIVORS GUILT.

151
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEIR FRIENDS

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
NO LONGER HAVE THEIR CHILDREN,

153
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
BUT SHE HAS HERS.

154
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
>> SHE SURVIVED BECAUSE SHE HAD

155
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
FOR THE STAFF AND FOR THE

187
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
COMMUNITY.

188
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
>> WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE

189
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
STUDENTS WHO ARE ENROLLED AT

190
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

191
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
>> WELL, THIS SCHOOL HERE, WE'RE

192
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
CLEARLY NOT GOING TO BE INTO

193
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
THIS BUILDING ANY TIME IN THE

194
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

195
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO A PLAN TO

196
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
MOVE THE COMMUNITY TO -- THE

197
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
SCHOOL COMMUNITY TO ANOTHER

198
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
LOCATION.

199
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
THOSE DETAILS WILL PROBABLY COME

200
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
OUT TODAY.

201
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'M NOT REALLY PREPARED TO

202
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
REALLY SAY BUT WE KNOW IT'LL
WORK.

203
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
>> I KNOW IT'S EARLY.

204
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN EVER

205
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
RE-OPEN THIS SCHOOL AND WHAT

206
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
WOULD YOU SAY TO PARENTS WHO SAY

207
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I NEVER WANT TO SEND MY CHILD --
>> I WOULD PROBABLY FEEL VERY

208
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
MUCH THE SAME WAY.

209
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I MEAN, MY THREE DAUGHTERS WENT

210
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
TO THIS SCHOOL, AND WE HAVE MANY
MEMORIES THERE.

211
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I THINK TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

212
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THAT

213
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
IS A LONG PROCESS, AND, YOU

214
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
KNOW, WE'RE NOT ANYWHERE

215
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
PREPARED TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS

216
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
NOW.

217
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE

218
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
IMPORTANCE OF RE-ESTABLISHING

219
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
ROUTINES, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE

220
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
HARD TO DO IN THIS ATMOSPHERE.

221
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
WHAT KIND OF SPECIAL ALLOWANCES

222
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
WILL YOU TAKE FOR THE STAFF AND

223
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
FOR THE STUDENTS WHO ARE REALLY

224
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
HURTING AS YOU TRY TO

225
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
REESTABLISH ROUTINES?

226
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
>> WELL, WE BROUGHT IN HEALTH

227
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
CARE PROFESSIONALS, MENTAL

228
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS FROM ALL

229
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
OVER THE STATE AND HAVE SPECIAL

230
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
TRAINING FOR PEOPLE AND KNOW

231
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
SOME OF THE TEACHERS MIGHT NOT

232
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
BE PREPARED TO COME BACK AND

233
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
WE WILL BE PREPARED WITH

234
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
SUBSTITUTES AND WE'VE GOT

235
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
COUNSELING FOR ALL THE PEOPLE.

236
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
WE'RE PREPARED TO DO WHATEVER WE

237
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
HAVE TO DO TO HELP ALL OF OUR

238
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
COMMUNITY.

239
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
>> WE KEEP HEARING THESE STORIES

240
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
OF THE VALOR DISPLAYED BY THE
PRINCIPAL AT THIS ELEMENTARY

241
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
SCHOOL AND ALSO SOME OF THE
TEACHERS.

242
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?

243
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
>> WELL, I THINK WE HAD --

244
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THAT'S REALLY THE BIG STORY
HERE.

245
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THERE'S SOME INCREDIBLE HEROES,

246
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
AND I THINK WHAT THEY DID MOVING

247
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
TO MOVE ALL THE OTHER CHILDREN

248
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
TO SAFE LOCATIONS AND GOING

249
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
THROUGH OUR LOCKDOWN PROCESS,

250
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
THAT SAVED COUNTLESS MORE LIVES.

251
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
THOSE TEACHERS, THE STAFF THAT

252
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
WERE THERE, THE FIRST RESPONDERS

253
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
WHO CAME IN, THEY'RE THE PEOPLE

254
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
WHO ARE THE REAL HEROES.

255
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
>> BILL HART, VERY DIFFICULT JOB

256
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
AND I WISH YOU THE BEST.

257
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
>> THANK YOU, DAN.

258
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
>> AS WE SAID HE HAS A VERY
DIFFICULT JOB.

259
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
ONCE AGAIN OUR THANKS TO BILL
HART.

260
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
LET'S GET IT BACK TO NEW YORK

261
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
NOW AND BIANNA.

262
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
>> SO HARD TO PROCESS THAT POINT

263
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
THAT YOU MADE, DAN.

264
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
THAT MOST OF THESE VICTIMS STILL

265
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
HAVE THEIR BABY TEETH.

266
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
SUCH A HEINOUS ACT AND SUCH

267
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
INNOCENCE LOST.
>>> WELL, WE ARE GETTING A MORE

268
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
COMPLETE PICTURE THIS MORNING OF

269
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
THE GUNMAN AS POLICE TRY TO

270
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
LEARN WHY 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA
WENT ON HIS BLOODY RAMPAGE.

271
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
ABC'S CHIEF INVESTIGATOR

272
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
CORRESPONDENT BRIAN ROSS IS
HERE.

273
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
AND YOU HEAR THE WEAPONS USED
WERE LIKELY LICENSED TO HIS

274
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
MOTHER WHO IS DESCRIBED AS A GUN

275
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
ENTHUSIAST.
>> THAT IS CORRECT, BIANNA.

276
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
AND AUTHORITIES SAY THEY ARE
MOVING QUICKLY WITH MORE

277
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
DEVELOPMENTS LIKELY TO COME
TODAY IN EFFORTS TO DETERMINE

278
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
THE HOW AND THE WHY OF THIS
STUNNING CRIME.

279
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
POLICE SAY THEY HAVE ALREADY

280
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
FOUND IMPORTANT CLUES IN THE

281
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
LANZAS' FOUR-BEDROOM, $600,000

282
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
HOME WHERE THE KILLER'S MOTHER,

283
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
52-YEAR-OLD NANCY LANZA, WAS THE

284
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
FIRST VICTIM.

COMPLETE PICTURE AS TO HOW AND

286
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
MORE IMPORTANTLY WHY THIS
OCCURRED.

287

>> Reporter: AUTHORITIES NOW SAY

288
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
NANCY LANZA OWNED THE SAME STYLE

289
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
OF GUNS THAT HER SON USED TO

290
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
KILL HER AND THE 26 VICTIMS AT

291
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

292
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER SAID MOST

293
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
WERE KILLED WITH MULTIPLE SHOTS

294
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
FROM THE HIGH-POWERED

295
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE.

296
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
>> THIS PROBABLY IS THE WORST I

297
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
HAVE SEEN.

298
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
>> Reporter: THE CONNECTION

299
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
BETWEEN ADAM LANZA AND THE SANDY

HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GOES BACK

301
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
TO THE TIME HE WENT TO SCHOOL

302
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
THERE, AND HIS MOTHER WORKED AS

303
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
A TEACHER'S AIDE.

304
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
ACCORDING TO ADAM'S AUNT MARSHA

LANZA --

306
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
>> I KNOW HE HAD ISSUES WITH
SCHOOL.

307
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
SHE EVENTUALLY WOUND UP HOME

308
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
SCHOOLING HIM.

309
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
SHE BATTLED WITH THE SCHOOL

310
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
DISTRICT AND IN WHAT CAPACITY,

311
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'M NOT 100% CERTAIN IF IT WAS

312
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
BEHAVIOR.

313
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
IF IT WAS LEARNING DISABILITIES.

314
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
>> Reporter: AS A FULLER PICTURE

315
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
OF ADAM LANZA BEGAN TO EMERGE

316
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
INCLUDING HIS MEMBERSHIP IN THE

317
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
HIGH SCHOOL TECH CLUB, FORMER

318
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
CLASSMATES TELL ABC NEWS HE WAS

319
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
A SMART BUT SOCIALLY AWKWARD

320
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
STUDENT.

321
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
>> HE ALWAYS CARRIED A

322
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
BRIEFCASE.
AND THAT'S WHAT STICKS OUT MOST

323
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
IN MY MIND.
>> Reporter: ADAM'S PARENTS

324
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
PETER AND NANCY LANZA WENT

325
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
THROUGH AN UNCONTESTED DIVORCE
THREE YEARS AGO, AND ADAM'S AUNT

326
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
SAID THAT NANCY HAD PURCHASED SO

327
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
MANY WEAPONS BECAUSE SHE WAS

328
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
CONCERNED FOR HER SAFETY LIVING

329
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
ALONE.

330
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
>> I THINK THE REASON WHY NANCY

331
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
MAY HAVE HAD THEM FOR THE MANY

332
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
MORE OF US IN THIS COUNTRY,

333
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
SELF-DEFENSE AND NO OTHER

334
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
REASON.

335
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
>> Reporter: FRIENDS HAVE TOLD

336
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
US IS THAT NANCY LANZA HAPPY TO

337
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
TAKE HER SONS TO A NEARBY FIRING

338
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
RANGE BEFORE TARGET PRACTICE AND

339
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
WAS HAPPY TO DO THAT.

340
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
>> SHE COULD HAVE BEEN THERE

341
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
WHEN HE WAS LEARNING HOW TO

342
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
SHOOT THOSE GUNS.
IT LED TO HER DEATH AND THE

343
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
DEATH OF 26 OTHERS.

344
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

345
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
DAN, I KNOW YOU HAVE MORE ON

346
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
THOSE 26 VICTIMS AS WELL NOW.
>> AS WE SAID WE NOW KNOW THEIR

347
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
NAMES.

348
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
THEY'RE SO YOUNG, ALL 6 AND 7

349
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
YEARS OLD, ALL IN THE FIRST

350
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
GRADE, ALL SHOT MORE THAN ONCE

351
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
BY A SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE.

352
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER SAYING

353
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
DEATH WAS MERCIFULLY SWIFT.

354
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
AND ADDED IT'S PROBABLY THE

355
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
WORST HE HAS EVER SEEN IN THREE

356
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
DECADES ON THE JOB.

357
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
AND AMY ROBACH IS HERE WITH MORE
ON THIS.

358
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
THIS IS REALLY THE HARDEST PART.
>> IT TRULY IS.

359
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
BECAUSE AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT

360
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
THE VICTIMS, IT TRULY GETS

361
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
HARDER.

362
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
WE KNOW THE NAMES AND SEE THE

363
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
FACES OF THOSE SWEET LITTLE BOYS

364
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
AND GIRLS, THE TEACHERS WHO

365
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
LOVED THEM AND, OF COURSE, THE

366
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
PARENTS WHO SO DESPERATELY MISS

367
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000

US AND THE OTHER FAMILIES WHO
HAVE EXPERIENCED LOSS IN IN

SHIELDING SOME OF HER FIRST

PRINCIPAL.

413
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
DAWN HOCHSPRUNG, A MOTHER

414
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
HERSELF, IT IS NOW BELIEVED SHE

415
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
TURNED ON THE P.A.
SYSTEM WHEN THE SHOOTING STARTED

416
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
SO OTHERS COULD BE WARNED OF THE

417

DANGERS THAT HAD INVADED THEIR

418
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
SCHOOL.

419
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO FIND THE

420
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
RIGHT WORDS AFTER SEEING HOW

421
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
MUCH THIS COMMUNITY HAS LOST,

422
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
BUT SOMEHOW, SOME WAY THE FATHER

423
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
OF LITTLE EMILIE PARKER FOUND

424
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
THOSE WORDS WHEN HE SPOKE TO

425
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
CAMERAS OUTSIDE OF A NEWTOWN

426
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
CHURCH.

427
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
>> AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

428
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

429
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

430
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

431
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
WAS AND HOW MANY LIVES THAT SHE

432
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
WAS ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT

433
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
TIME HERE ON EARTH.

434
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

435
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
VERY LOVING AS THOSE WERE THE

436
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
GIFTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY

437
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
HER HEAVENLY FATHER.

438
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
THE STRENGTH THAT SHE GAVE US

439
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
AND THE EXAMPLE THAT SHE SHOWED

440
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
US WAS REMARKABLE.

441
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON, AND

442
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER DAD.

443
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET THROUGH

444
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

445
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
MY WIFE AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND

446
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
HOW TO PROCESS ALL OF THIS AND

447
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
HOW TO GET OUR LIVES GOING.

448
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'M NOT MAD, BECAUSE I HAVE TO

449
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
MAKE SURE THAT I USE THIS EVENT

450
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
TO DO WHAT I CAN, TO DO WHATEVER

451
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I CAN TO, ONE, MAKE SURE THAT MY

452
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
FAMILY AND MY WIFE AND MY

453
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
DAUGHTERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF AND

454
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
THAT IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I

455
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
CAN DO TO HELP ANYBODY ANYWHERE,

456
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'D BE WILLING TO DO THAT.

457
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
>> WHAT AN INCREDIBLY STRONG AND

458
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
BRAVE AND COURAGEOUS MAN.

459
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
MY HAT IS CERTAINLY OFF TO HIM

460
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
AS A PARENT.

461
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I DON'T THINK THAT I COULD DO
THAT.

462
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
>> AND COVERING THIS STORY AS A
PARENT, I KNOW YOU'VE GOT THREE

463
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
LITTLE GIRLS, EXTRAORDINARILY

464
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
DIFFICULT.
>> IT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.

465
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
SCHOOL IS CLOSED HERE IN NEWTOWN

466
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
TOMORROW, BUT EVERYONE AROUND

467
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
THE COUNTRY, EVERY PARENT OUT

468
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
THERE WHO IS GOING TO TAKE THEIR

469
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
CHILDREN TO SCHOOL TOMORROW,

470
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
IT'S GOING TO BE A FUNDAMENTALLY

471
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE BECAUSE

472
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
THERE IS A FEAR FACTOR AND THE

473
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
SENSE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW.

474
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
THAT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ISN'T

475
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
SACRED ANYMORE.

476
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
IT'S NOT A SAFE PLACE ANYMORE

477
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
THAT WE ONCE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

478
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
AND A LOT OF PARENTS WILL HUG

479
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
THEIR KIDS MORE TIGHTLY TOMORROW

480
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
AND TELL THEM THEY LOVE THEM

481
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
BEFORE THEY SEND THEM OFF.

482
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
>> INDEED, AND TAKING THINGS NOT

483
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
SO MUCH FOR GRANTED ANYMORE.
I KNOW LARA IN THE BROADCAST

484
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
YOU'RE GOING TO BE BACK ABOUT
HOW TO TALK TO CHILDREN ABOUT

485
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
THIS.

486
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
>> IT'S A BIG STRUGGLE.

487
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
>> AMY, EXCELLENT REPORTING.

488
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

489
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
>> SUNDAY MORNING IS ALWAYS A
TIME FOR REFLECTION BUT EVEN

490
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
MORE SO ON THIS DAY AND IN THIS

491
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
PLACE.
ABC'S JUJU CHANG IS AT ONE OF

492
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
THE CHURCHES HERE IN NEWTOWN.

493
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
JUJU, GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

494
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000

IN.

497
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
MASS IS ABOUT TO GET UNDER WAY

498
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
AND THE HOUSES OF WORSHIP

499
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
THROUGHOUT NEWTOWN AND, IN FACT,

500
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ARE

501
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
PROVIDING A SENSE OF COMMUNITY

502
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
THIS MORNING.

503
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
BUT ALSO A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN
ASK QUESTIONS TO WHICH THERE ARE

504
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
NO EASY ANSWERS LIKE HOW COULD A

505
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
GUNMAN WIPE OUT SUCH INNOCENCE?

506
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
HERE ON THE GROUNDS OF ST. ROSE

507
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000

MEMORIALS.

508
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
AND WHEN YOU WALK UP TO THEM,

509
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
YOU CAN SEE CANDLES AND FLOWERS

510
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
AND NOTES OF CONDOLENCES BUT

511
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
ALSO CHILDLIKE ITEMS, A SOCCER

512
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
BALL SIGNED BY THE NEWTOWN

513
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
SOCCER CLUB, LITTLE STUFFED

514
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
ANIMALS LIKE THE KIND A 6 OR

515
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
7-YEAR-OLD WOULD TAKE TO BED AND

516
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
A NOTE THAT SAID SIMPLY "SLEEP

517
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
IN HEAVENLY PEACE."

518
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
DAN?

519
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
>> AND THOSE CHILDLIKE ITEMS AS

520
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000

TOUGHEST TO SEE.

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
JUJU, I KNOW SEVERAL FAMILIES

522
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000

FRONT OF WHICH YOU ARE STANDING

524
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
LOST CHILDREN.

525
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
HOW IS THE CHURCH DEALING WITH

526
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
THAT?

527
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
>> Reporter: DAN, IT IS SUCH A

528
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
POIGNANT THOUGHT.

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
INFORMING FAMILIES THEY LOST

533
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
CHILDREN HAD SPENT LAST NIGHT

534
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000

AND, YOU KNOW, THROUGHOUT THIS

540
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
TOWN, THE CHURCHES AND THE

541
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
HOUSES OF WORSHIP ARE NOT JUST

542
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
WRAPPING THEIR ARMS AROUND THE

543
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
FAMILIES THAT SUFFERED A DIRECT
LOSS BUT FOR THE ENTIRE

544
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
COMMUNITY WHICH SAYS THEY'LL

545
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000

BREW THE COFFEE YOU LOVE --

961
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
>>> IT WAS PEACEFUL AND

962
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
>>> IT WAS PEACEFUL AND

963
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
EVERYTHING WAS FINE, EVERYTHING

964
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
WAS JUST NORMAL.

965
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
AS A REGULAR FRIDAY MORNING

966
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
WOULD BE TO EVERYONE AND THEN IT

967
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
ALL JUST CHANGED.

968
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
>> HEARD SCREAMING.

969
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
>> WE WERE LIKE ALL SCARED.

970
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
>> WE HEARD A LOUD BANG.

971
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
WE THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING FELL

972
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
THEN WE HEARD ANOTHER AND THEN

973
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
WE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS A

974
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
GUNSHOT.
>> WE THOUGHT IT WAS A SAFETY

975
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
DRILL BUT THEN WE NOTICED IT WAS

976
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
REAL.

977
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
>> WE HID IN THE STORAGE ROOM

978
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
AND I ACTUALLY PRAYED TO GOD.

979
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
>> EVERYBODY WAS A LITTLE SCARED

980
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
CRYING AND I FELT ACTUALLY A

981
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
LITTLE SICK LIKE I WAS GOING TO

982
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
THROW UP.

983
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
>> IT FELT LIKE IT LASTED LIKE

984
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
AN HOUR BUT IT WAS REALLY LIKE

985
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
MAYBE 20 MINUTES.

986
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
>> WHEN I WENT TO THE FIRE

987
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
DEPARTMENT, WHEN I DIDN'T SEE

988
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
HIM, I WAS LIKE, OH, MY GOD,

989
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER.

990
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
>> WHAT'S THE HARDEST PART?
>> THAT SOMEONE WOULD MURDER SO

991
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
MANY PEOPLE.

992
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
>> AND I FINALLY SAW ETHAN I WAS
VERY RELIEVED.

993
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
>> YOU SAID EARLIER YOU SAID YOU

994
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
THINK YOUR TEACHER SAVED YOUR
LIFE.

995
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
>> SHE SAVED ALL OF US.

996
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
THERE'S 19 PEOPLE IN OUR CLASS

997
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
AND SHE SAVED ALL OF US.

998
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
>> AND THE QUESTION FACING

999
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
PARENTS EVERYWHERE THIS MORNING

1000
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
IS, OF COURSE, HOW DO I TALK TO

1001
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
MY OWN CHILD ABOUT THESE

1002
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
TERRIBLE EVENTS?

1003
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN THE

1004
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
UNEXPLAINABLE?

1005
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
THE UNEXPLAINABLE, DIFFICULT FOR

1006
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
EVEN US TO COMPREHEND.

1007
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
JOINING US IS JOURNALIST AND

1008
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000

ANSWER YOUR CHILD'S QUESTIONS

1012
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
ABOUT THE WORLD WE LIVE IN."

1013
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
SHE JOINS US FROM LOS ANGELES

1014
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
AND WILLOW WAS A FORMER ANCHOR

1015
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
HERE OF THIS PROGRAM.
WE WANT TO WELCOME YOU BACK TO

1016
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
THE PROGRAM.

1017
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.

1018
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
>> NICE TO BE WITH YOU ON WHAT
IS REALLY A TRAGIC MORNING FOR

1019
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
ALL OF US, FOR ALL PARENTS.

1020
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
AND CHILDREN ALIKE.

1021
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
>> WILLOW, I WANT TO START BY

1022
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
ASKING YOU THE QUESTION THAT

1023
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS
MORNING, ALL THREE OF US BEING

1024
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
PARENTS, HOW DO WE APPROACH THIS
TOPIC?

1025
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I KNOW MY KIDS WERE ASKING ABOUT
IT LAST NIGHT, WHERE I WOULD BE

1026
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
THIS MORNING.
HOW DO YOU DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S

1027
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
COMPASSIONATE AND GIVING THEM

1028
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED

1029
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
BUT NOT TOO MUCH?

1030
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
>> SO THE FIRST THING YOU WANT

1031
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
TO DO IS ESTABLISH THAT THERE'S

1032
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
NO QUESTION TOO SCARY FOR YOUR

1033
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
CHILD TO TALK ABOUT, TO CREATE A

1034
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
REALLY SAFE AND COMFORTABLE

1035
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
PLACE FOR THEM TO COME AND TALK

1036
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
TO YOU.

1037
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
THE SECOND THING YOU WANT TO DO

1038
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
IS SUPPRESS THE NORMAL PARENTAL

1039
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
INSTINCT TO TELL THEM

1040
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
EVERYTHING.

1041
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
YOU WANT IT TO COME FROM YOU.

1042
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
YOU WANT TO BE THE ONE TO TELL
THEM.

1043
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
BUT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

1044
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
SITUATIONS WHERE WE NEED TO DO

1045
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
WHAT WE DO AS JOURNALISTS AND

1046
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
ASK OUR CHILDREN QUESTIONS SO WE

1047
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
GET A BASELINE ON WHAT THEY'RE
UNDERSTANDING.

1048
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
REMEMBER, THEY'RE PROCESSING

1049
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
UNTHINKABLE INFORMATION AND

1050
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
ADULT INFORMATION WITH THE MINDS

1051
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
OF CHILDREN.
SO YOU WANT TO ASK THEM

1052
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
QUESTIONS LIKE, WELL, WHAT DO

1053
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

1054
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT?

1055
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
ARE THE KIDS AT SCHOOL TALKING

1056
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
ABOUT THAT?

1057
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
JUST AS A WAY OF GETTING THE

1058
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
CONVERSATION STARTED AND AS A

1059
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
WAY OF GETTING MORE PRECISE

1060
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT EXACTLY

1061
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
THEY KNOW AND THINK TO BE THE

1062
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
TRUTH.

1063
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
>> AND, WILLOW, ONE OF THE

1064
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
QUESTIONS I RECEIVED FROM MY
10-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, ONE OF THE

1065
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
FIRST QUESTIONS OUT OF HER MOUTH

1066
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
WAS WHY MOMMY.
WHY WOULD SOMEONE DO LIKE THIS

1067
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I DIDN'T HAVE

1068
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
AN ANSWER FOR HER.
WHAT DO YOU TELL YOUR CHILDREN,

1069
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
WILLOW, WHEN THEY ASK WHY?

1070
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
>> BY THE WAY, MY 14-YEAR-OLD --

1071
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING HE SAID

1072
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
TO ME, HOW -- WHY WOULD SOMEBODY

1073
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
DO THIS AND I THINK IN THAT

1074
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
SITUATION IT'S FINE TO ANSWER

1075
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
TRUTHFULLY, WHICH IS I DON'T

1076
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
KNOW.

1077
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I THINK EVERYBODY IS ASKING THAT

1078
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
QUESTION TODAY.

1079
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
BUT THEN WITH A YOUNG CHILD

1080
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
PARTICULARLY WITH A YOUNG CHILD

1081
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
BECAUSE THE YOUNG CHILDREN THINK
VERY CONCRETELY.

1082
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
THEY DON'T -- THEY HAVEN'T

1083
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
MASTERED ABSTRACT THINKING.
ASK THEM, WELL, WHY DO YOU

1084
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
THINK, WHY DO YOU THINK SOMEBODY

1085
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
WOULD HAVE MADE A CHOICE LIKE

1086
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
THAT AND IT'LL GET THEM

1087
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
PROCESSING SOME OF THIS

1088
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
INFORMATION IN THEIR OWN WAY.

1089
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
AND THEN YOU CAN STEER THE

1090
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
CONVERSATION TO WAYS PEOPLE

1091
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
COULD MAKE BETTER CHOICES, FOR

1092
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
EXAMPLE.

1093
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
>> OKAY.

1094

1273
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
HEART HAS BEEN LIFTED FROM ALL
THE GOOD THAT'S COMING IN CROSS

1274
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD.

1275
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE.

1276
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
>> AND THIS EVENING THE

1277
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
PRESIDENT WILL BE HERE IN

1278
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
NEWTOWN TO MEET WITH FAMILIES

1279
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
WHO HAVE LOST AND ALSO TO SPEAK

1280
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
AT AN INTERFAITH VIGIL.

1281
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
BIANNA, BACK TO YOU IN NEW YORK.

1282
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
>> JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU SEE

1283
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
THE WORST PART OF SOCIETY, YOU

1284
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
SEE THE KINDNESS, AS WELL AND I
THINK ALL OF US CAN SAY THIS

1285
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
WEEKEND WE'RE ALL PART OF
NEWTOWN.

1286
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
ALL RIGHT, LARA, THANK YOU, AND
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1287
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
ASK
I was living with
this all-over pain.

1288
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
A deep, throbbing,
persistent ache.

1289
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
My doctor diagnosed it
as fibromyalgia,

1290
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
thought to be the
result of overactive nerves

1291
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
that cause chronic
widespread pain.

1292
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Lyrica is believed
to calm these nerves.

1293
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I learned Lyrica can provide
significant relief

1294
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
from fibromyalgia pain.

1295
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And for some people,
it can work in as early as

1296
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
the first week of treatment.

1297
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So now I can do more of
the things that I enjoy.

1298
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Lyrica is not for everyone.

1299
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Lyrica may cause serious
allergic reactions

1300
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
or suicidal thoughts or actions.

1301
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Tell your doctor right away
if you have these,

1302
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
new or worsening depression,

1303
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
or unusual changes in mood
or behavior,

1304
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
or any swelling or
affected breathing or skin,

1305
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
or changes in eyesight,
including blurry vision

1306
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
or muscle pain with fever
or tired feeling.

1307
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Common side effects
are dizziness, sleepiness,

1308
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
weight gain, and swelling of
hands, legs and feet.

1309
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Don't drink alcohol
while taking Lyrica.

1310
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Don't drive or use machinery
until you know

1311
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
how Lyrica affects you.

1312
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
With less pain,
I'm feeling better

1313
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
now that I've found Lyrica.

1314
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Ask your doctor
if Lyrica is right

1315
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
for your fibromyalgia pain.

1316
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
