SHE ACTUALLY HERSELF WANTED TO

254
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
BE A TEACHER EVERY SINCE SHE

255
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
HERSELF WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

256
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000

257
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
ESPECIALLY PROUD WHEN SHE BECAME

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000

THAT, COMING FACE-TO-FACE WITH

406
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
THE SHOOTER, WOLF.

407
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
>> WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I GOT TO

408
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
THE SCHOOL AND REALIZED IT WAS

409
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
SANDY HOOK, PULLED DOWN AS FAR

410
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
AS I COULD, I COULDN'T GET ALL

411
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
THE WAY.

412
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I DROVE OVER THE CURB INTO THE

413
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
FIREHOUSE PARKING LOT AND I

414
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
SAID, IT'S HERE, IT'S HERE,

415
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
THERE'S BEEN A SHOOTING HERE.

416
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
AND I SAW -- I SAW THE EMTs

417
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
WORKING ON A LITTLE BOY AND I

418
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
KNEW IT WASN'T OUR SON I KNEW IT

419
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
WAS CLOSE, I RAN TO THE SCHOOL.

420
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
YOU KNOW THE CHAOS IS

421
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
INDESCRIBABLE.

422
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE LIVING THROUGH

423
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
COLUMBINE, EVERYTHING YOU'VE
SEEN ON TV.

424
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
SO AS THE CHILDREN START TO COME

425
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
OUT, YOU KNOW, SINGLE TIME,

426
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
CLASS BY CLASS, GROUP BY GROUP,

427
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
WHEN YOU SEE THEIR TEACHER, I

428
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
SAW MY DAUGHTER'S TEACHER, SHE

429
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
WASN'T -- MY DAUGHTER WASN'T

430
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
WITH HER TEACHER AND I GRABBED

431
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
HER TEACH SOMEWHERE ASKED HER

432
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
WHERE SHE WAS SHE SAID SHE

433
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
DIDN'T KNOW BECAUSE SHE WASN'T

434
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
WITH THE CLASS.

435
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
SO THE KIDS START TO COME OUT.

436
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
WHEN I SAW HER, THE SENSE OF

437
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
RELIEF IS INCREDIBLE BUT IT'S

438
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
REALLY SHORT-LIVED BECAUSE I

439
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
STILL HAVE ONE IN THERE AND I'M

440
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
WAITING FOR HIM TO COME.

441
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
AND HE DIDN'T COME OUT.

442
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
AND I DIDN'T SEE HIS TEACHER AND

443
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I DIDN'T SEE HIS CLASSMATES.

444
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
SO AS A PARENT, YOU KNOW, I

445
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
HUGGED MADE DAUGHTER AND I SAID,

446
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
YOU KNOW, I TOLD HER TO HUG HER

447
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
FRIEND IN HER CLASS AND I SAID

448
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
GO TO THE FIRE STATION, DADDY'S

449
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
COMING.
I'M GOING TO WAIT FOR ADEN.

450
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'M GOING TO WAIT.

451
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
AND HE DIDN'T COME OUT.

452
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
SO YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE

453
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
STANDING THERE WAITING, AND NO

454
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
ONE WILL TELL YOU ANYTHING, IT'S

455
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
INDESCRIBABLE FEELING OF

456
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
HELPLESSNESS.
YOU KNOW, WE ARE VERY LUCKY

457
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
BECAUSE I THINK I WAS THERE AN

458
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
HOUR AND THEN THE GROUP STOPPED

459
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
COMING AND I JUST KNEW NO ONE

460
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
ELZ WAS COMING OUT OF THAT

461
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
SCHOOL.
I KNEW IN MY HEART.

462
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I ACTUALLY RECEIVED A TEXT FROM

463
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
A FRIEND SAID THAT HE WAS AT THE

464
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
POLICE STATION AND HE WAS SAFE

465
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
THERE AND HE WAS ONE OF THE

466
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
GROUPS OF KIDS THAT RAN THAT GOT

467
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
OUT, HAD BEEN PICKED UP.

468
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
WHEN WE WENT THERE, AND I SAW

469
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT WAS

470
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
JUST AN INCREDIBLE FEELING OF

471
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
RELIEF AND I FEEL SO BLESSED.

472
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
IT'S JUST A FEELING OF BLESSING.

473
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
>> A MIRACLE.

474
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
>> TRULY IS.

475
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
>> ANGELS ON THEIR SHOULDER.

476
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
THE CHILDREN GOT OUT OF THE KAS

477
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
ROOM.
IT WAS A BLESSING.

478
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
INDESCRIBABLE.

479
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
>> IT'S AN AMAZING FEELING.

480
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
AND YOU FEEL -- YOU FEEL SO

481
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
RELIEVED BUT AT THE SAME TIME

482
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
YOU KNOW THAT OTHERS CAN'T SHARE

483
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
THAT FEELING.

484
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
AND YOU JUST -- YOUR HEART

485
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
DOESN'T KNOW WHICH DIRECTION TO

486
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
GO.
THEIR FRIENDS, THEIR NEIGHBORS.

487
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
>> THESE ARE CHILDREN THAT OUR

488
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
CHILDREN WENT TO PRESCHOOL WITH,

489
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
KNOWN SINCE THEY WERE 2 YEARS

490
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
OLD 3 YEAR OLD, SO THE MAGNITUDE

491
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
OF WHAT'S HAPPENED, NOT JUST FOR

492
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
US BUT FOR EVERYONE IN THIS

493
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
COMMUNITY, HASN'T EVEN BEEN FELT

494
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
YET.

495
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
THE CHILDREN WILL LEARN ABOUT

496
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR TEACHER

497
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
AND OTHERS THAT THEY KNOW AND,

498
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
YOU KNOW, WE, AS PARENTS, NEED

499
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
TO DO THE BEST TO PREPARE OUR

500
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
CHILDREN FOR THAT AND EXPLAIN IN

501
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
THE BEST WAY WE CAN THAT MAKES

502
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
SENSE TO THEM WHAT'S HAPPENED

503
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
AND HOW TO KIND OF HELP THEM

504
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
THROUGH THAT PROCESS.

505
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
>> FROM WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TOLD BY

506
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
YOUR SON AND WHAT YOU KNOW NOW,

507
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
WHAT HAPPENED?

508
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
>> ACCORDING TO ADEN, THEY WENT

509
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
THROUGH A NORMAL DAY.

510
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
THEY DID THEIR CIRCLE TIME,

511
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
WHERE THEY INTRODUCE EACH OTHER,

512
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
THEY DID THEIR MESSAGE --

513
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
>> OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER.

514
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
>> AND THEY WERE DOING THEIR

515
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE

516
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
LOUDSPEAKER.

517
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
AND THAT'S WHEN THEY HEARD

518
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
NOISES THAT HE DESCRIBED AS

519
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
INITIALLY THEY THOUGHT WERE

520
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
HAMMERS FALLING.

521
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
THEN THEY REALIZED THAT IT WAS

522
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
GUNSHOTS.
AND MISS SOTO, ADEN'S TEACHER,

523
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO MOVE

524
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
ALL OF THE CHILDREN TO A

525
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE DOOR ON

526
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
THE SIDE OF THE ROOM FURTHEST

527
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
AWAY FROM THE DOOR AND THAT'S

528
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
WHEN THE GUNMAN BURST IN, DID

529
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
NOT SAY A WORD.

530
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
NO FACIAL EXPRESSIONS.

531
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
AND PROCEEDED TO SHOOT THEIR

532
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
TEACHER.

533
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
AT THAT TIME, THE CHILDREN FROM

534
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
AN EARLY AGE ARE TAUGHT, WHEN

535
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
THEY SEE A PERSON WITH A GUN,

536
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
YOU RUN AND YOU CALL 911.

537
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
AND THEY PRACTICE THAT IN SCHOOL

538
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
WITH THEIR FIRE AND EMERGENCY

539
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
DRILLS AND EVERYTHING.

540
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
WE'RE VERY LUCKY THAT ALL OF THE

541
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
CHILDREN, MY SON INCLUDED, HAD

542
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO REACT

543
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
APPROPRIATELY AND THEY BASICALLY

544
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
RAN RIGHT PAST THE GUNMAN OUT

545
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
THE DOOR.
>> RAN PAST THE GUNMAN?

546
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
>> HE'S STANDING IN THE DOOR AND

547
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
THEY RAN PAST HIM AND RAN DOWN

548
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
THE HALLWAY AND THEY'RE ONE OF

549
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
THE CLOSEST ROOMS TO THE MAIN

550
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
ENTRANCE, AND ADEN WAS -- HAD

551
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO HOLD THE

552
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
DOOR FOR ONE OF HIS CLASSMATES.

553
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
THERE WAS ANOTHER CLASSMATE THAT

554
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
WAS BEHIND AND WAITED FOR HIM

555
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
AND THEY ALL RAN TO THE ROAD,

556
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
THE MAN ROAD, ALL THE WAY DOWN.

557
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
AND WHERE THEY MET A WOMAN WHO

558
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
IS AN ANGEL TO US, WHO TOOK THEM

559
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
INTO HER VAN AND TOOK THEM TO

560
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
THE POLICE STATION.
>> HOW DID YOUR SON, HE'S 6

561
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
YEARS OLD, HAVE THE PRESENCE OF

562
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
MIND, FACED NOT ONLY BY SEEING

563
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
THIS HORRIFIC ACT HAPPEN IN

564
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
FRONT OF HIM, BUT THEN HAVE THE

565
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
PRESENCE OF MIND TO RUN PAST

566
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
THIS PERSON AND TO SAFETY?

567
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
>> I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO

568
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
HONESTLY KNOW WHAT WAS GOING

569
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
THROUGH HIS MIND.

570
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
YOU KNOW, IT'S SAD TO SAY THAT

571
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
IN TODAY'S WORLD I DO WATCH THE

572
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
NEWS WITH THE KIDS, I DO DISCUSS

573
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN,

574
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
AND HAVE TOLD THEM, YOU KNOW,

575
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
THINKING FROM A HIGH SCHOOL OR

576
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
COLLEGE PERSPECTIVE, IF ANYBODY

577
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
EVER COMES INTO YOUR CLASSROOM

578
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
WITH A GUN, YOU JUST RUN.

579
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
AND I'VE SAID THAT TO THEM

580
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
COUNTLESS TIMES, JUST -- YOU

581
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
JUST RUN.

582
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
AND SO I -- I'M SURE -- I'D LIKE

583
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
TO THINK THAT PART OF THAT IS

584
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
DEEP DOWN INSIDE, MY SON AND HE

585
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
KNEW HE HAD THE PRESENCE OF NIND

586
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
DO THAT.

587
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
AND I THINK PART OF IT WAS JUST

588
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
THIS FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE,

589
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
THIS INSTINCT THAT TOLD HIM AND

590
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
OTHER STUDENTS IN THAT ROOM TO

591
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
JUST LEAVE.

592
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
AND I THINK MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE

593
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
WAY THAT THINGS PLAYED OUT, HOW

594
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
THE GUNMAN CAME IN AND SHOT

595
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
THEIR TEACHER FIRST, I KNOW THEY

596
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
WOULD HAVE LOOKED TO HER FOR

597
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
GUIDANCE AND WITHOUT HER, TO

598
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
TELL THEM WHAT TO DO, THEY JUST

599
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
RAN.

600
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
AND IT'S HONESTLY A MIRACLE THAT

601
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'M ABLE TO HAVE -- WE'RE ABLE

602
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH

603
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
YOU AND WITH OUR SON STILL WITH

604
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
US.
>> DO YOU THINK HE KNOWS WHAT

605
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
THE -- THAT SHE LIKELY DID NOT

606
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
MAKE IT?

607
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
>> HE KEEPS ASKING ABOUT HER.

608
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
HE'S REASSURING HIMSELF THAT

609
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

610
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
HE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY CARED

611
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
ABOUT HIS TEACHER.

612
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
HE WAS VERY CLOSE WITH HER AND

613
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
SHE REALLY LOVED THAT CLASS.

614
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
HE KEEPS SAYING, I REALLY HOPE

615
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
SHE'S OKAY, I HOPE IT'S NOT HER.

616
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
HE KNOWS THAT SHE'S BEEN HURT

617
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW THE END

618
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
RESULT.
HE KNOWS THE KIDS THAT HE SAW

619
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
GETTING SHOT.

620
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE OUTCOME.

621
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I THINK HE'S REASSURING HIMSELF

622
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
IN HIS 6-YEAR-OLD MIND, I KNOW

623
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
HE'S PROCESSING IT, BUT I THINK

624
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
HE'S REASSURING HIMSELF.

625
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I THINK HE'S TELLING HIMSELF

626
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

627
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
>> WHAT WAS YESTERDAY SUPPOSED

628
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
TO BE LIKE?

629
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
>> I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO THERE

630
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
2:00 AND BUILD A GINGERBREAD

631
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
HOUSE, YOU KNOW?

632
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
THIS HE SOMETHING WE DO AS

633
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
PARENTS.

634
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
ALL PARENTS IN THIS COMMUNITY

635
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
VERY MUCH INVOLVED.

636
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
WE GO IN AND READ BOOKS.

637
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
DIANE'S ACTIVE IN VOLUNTEERING

638
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
THERE.
WE KNOW THE TEACHERS.

639
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
WE KNOW A LOT OF THE KIDS.

640
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
SO 2:00 I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO AND

641
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
BUILD A GINGERBREAD HOUSE.

642
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
THAT'S WHAT AIDEN'S CLASS WAS

643
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
DOING.
>> STARTS OUT LIKE ANY OTHER

644
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
DAY.

645
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
>> ROUTINE.
>> WORKING FROM HOME, I HAD

646
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
MEETINGS AND GOING TO THE GYM

647
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO

648
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
AIDEN'S CLASS BUT I ASKED ROBERT

649
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
IF HE HAD MEETINGS AND I SAID

650
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
WHY DON'T YOU GO, AIDEN WILL BE

651
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
EXCITED.
HE COULDN'T WAIT FOR DADDY TO

652
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
COME.
START OFF LIKE ANY OTHER DAY.

653
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
>> Reporter: WHAT WAS LAST NIGHT

654
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
LIKE WHEN YOU FINALLY HAVE YOUR

655
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
FAMILY BACK TOGETHER AND YOU

656
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
COME HOME?

657
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
>> THE DAY WAS HOURLESS.

658
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I COULDN'T TELL YOU WHAT TIME IT

659
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
WAS.

660
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
IT WAS -- TIME ALMOST STOOD

661
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
STILL BUT AT THE SAME TIME JUST

662
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
KEPT PROGRESSING.

663
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
HAVING THE KIDS, WE STAYED SO

664
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
CLOSE TOGETHER.

665
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
WE SAT ON THE COUCH ALL NIGHT.

666
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
THE KIDS, WE TRIED TO KEEP THEM

667
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
PROTECTED, LETTING THEM WATCH

668
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO ON

669
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
TELEVISION AND WE STAYED REALLY,

670
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
REALLY CLOSE.

671
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
WE ALL SLEPT IN THE SAME ROOM

672
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
LAST NIGHT.
>> Reporter: DAN, WHAT'S THAT

673
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
MOMENT LIKE WHEN YOU KNOW HOW

674
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
YOUR DAY WENT AND THEN YOU GOT

675
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
EVERYONE TOGETHER?

676
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
>> YOU BREAK -- FOR ME I'VE BEEN

677
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
A VERY EMOTIONAL PERSON AND YOU

678
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
JUST -- I JUST BROKE DOWN

679
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
BECAUSE I'M SOBBING BECAUSE I'M

680
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
RELIEVED, BECAUSE I HAVE MY SON

681
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
BUT I'M SOBBING BECAUSE I KNOW

682
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
THAT OTHERS DO NOT AND THAT

683
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
ADULTS WERE LOST, CHILDREN WERE

684
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
LOST, PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROM

685
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
SUCH AN INCREDIBLE,

686
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
INDESCRIBABLE LOSS THAT THE ONLY

687
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
THING I KNOW HOW TO DO TO

688
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
PROCESS IT IS LET THAT -- THOSE

689
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
FEELINGS OUT.

690
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
AND I JUST STARTED CRYING.

691
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
>> WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO

692
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
EXPECT.
WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW -- IF THEY

693
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
WERE GOING TO WAKE UP AND, YOU

694
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
KNOW, WITH A NIGHTMARE, AND

695
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
HAPPILY TODAY ACTUALLY SLEPT

696
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
WELL AND WE ALL -- THE KIDS

697
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
SLEPT WELL.
>> I DIDN'T SLEEP.

698
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
>> YOU PROCESS THINGS.

699
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
YOU KEEP REPLAYING WHAT OUR

700
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
SON -- WHAT WENT THROUGH HIS

701
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
MIND AND WHAT HAPPENED AND I

702
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
DON'T THINK AS ADULTS WE CAN

703
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
EVEN POSSIBLY IMAGINE WHAT ANY

704
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
CHILD SAW THAT DAY ESPECIALLY NO

705
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
LESS OUR SON.

706
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
SO WE WEREN'T SURE WHAT TO

707
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
EXPECT.
THEY WOKE UP HAPPY.

708
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AS

709
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
PARENTS IS PROJECT A SENSE OF

710
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
NORMALCY AND A SENSE OF ROUTINE.

711
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
>> A SENSE OF SAFETY.

712
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
>> SAFETY.

713
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
>> BECAUSE HE -- WE HAD TO PUT

714
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
THE SIGN OUT IN THE FRONT TODAY

715
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
ASKING PEOPLE NOT TO RING THE

716
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
DOORBELL BECAUSE HE STILL HASN'T

717
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
INTERNALIZED THE FACT THAT THIS

718
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
GUNMAN, THIS BAD GUY, IS GONE

719
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
AND HE WANTS TO KNOW IF THERE

720
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
ARE MORE BAD GUYS IN THE WORLD.

721
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER

722
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
THAT QUESTION PROPERLY.

723
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
AND SO WHEN SOMEONE RINGS THE

724
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
DOORBELL HE THINKS IT'S HIM

725
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
COMING BACK, COMING FOR HIM.

726
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
SO HE -- HE -- SO I THINK OUR

727
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
BIGGEST CONCERN NOW IS MAKING

728
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
SURE THAT WE HANDLE HIS

729
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
SENSITIVE NATURE PROPERLY AND

730
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
CAREFULLY AND SUPPORT HIM AND

731
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
SUPPORT OUR DAUGHTER BECAUSE
SHE, AGAIN, DOES PROCESS THINGS

732
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN HE DOES.

733
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
SO THAT'S OUR JOB AS PARENTS

734
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
NOW, TO STAY CLOSE TO THEM, HOLD

735
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
THEM, HUG THEM, LOVE THEM, AND

736
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE

737
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
SAFE.

738
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
>> Reporter: I'LL TELL YOU,

739
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
WOLF, ROBERT AND DIANE, THEY DID

740
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
NOT WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO BE ON

741
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
CAMERA.

742
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
THEY ARE STILL PROCESSING

743
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
EVERYTHING THAT HE HAVE GONE

KIDS ON A SATURDAY MORNING.

751
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
CLEARLY THEY ARE SHAKEN AFTER

752
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
EVERYTHING THEY'VE EXPERIENCED.

753
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
BOTH PARENTS SAID TO ME, AS HARD

754
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
AS IT IS FOR THIS FAMILY AND

755
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
WHAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH, THEY

756
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
KNOW THERE ARE MANY MORE

757
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
FAMILIES THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO

758
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
HUG THEIR CHILDREN TONIGHT AND

759
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
THEIR HEARTS ARE BREAKING FOR

760
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
THEM AND GO OUT TO THOSE

761
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
FAMILIES.
WOLF?

762
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000

763
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
THEM AS WELL.

764
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
KATE, THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING

765
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
THAT WITH ALL OF OUR VIEWERS.

766
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
WE HAVE SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL

767
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
WHEN WE COME BACK.

768
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
ROBBIE PARKER, THE FATHER OF

769
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
6-YEAR-OLD EMILY PARKER, SHE WAS

770
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
KILLED YESTERDAY.

771
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
HE IS NOW SPEAKING OUT.

772
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR WHAT HE'S

773
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000

774
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
6-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WHEN WE COME

00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
BACK.e.

776
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But when I was in an accident...

777
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I was worried the
health care system

778
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
spoke a language all its own

779
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
With UnitedHealthcare,
I got help that fit my life.

780
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Information on my phone.

781
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Connection to doctors who
get where I'm from.

782
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And tools to estimate what
my care may cost.

783
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So I never missed a beat.

784
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
We're more than 78,000
people looking out for

785
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
more than 70
million Americans.

786
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That's health in numbers.
UnitedHealthcare.

787
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
BOPRODUCTIVITY UP, COSTS DOWN,
THTIME TO MARKET REDUCED...

788
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
THOSE ARE GOOD THINGS.

789
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
UPSTAIRS, THEY WILL SEE FANTASY.

790
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
NOT FANTASY... LOGISTICS.

791
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
UPS CAME IN, ANALYZED OUR SUPPLY
CHAIN, INVENTORY SYSTEMS...

792

UPS?

793

UPS.

794
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
NOT FANTASY?

795
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?

796
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I DID.

797
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
WE DID, BOB. WE DID.

798
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
GOT IT.

799
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000

INCIDENT IN U.S. HISTORY AT A

IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

812
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING A VIGIL

813
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
THIS HOUR FOR ONE VICTIM, A

814
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
TEACHER, WHO DIED TRYING TO SAVE

815
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
HER STUDENTS.

816
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VICTORIA

817
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
SOTO.
TODAY WE LEARNED THE NAMES OF

818
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
ALL SIX ADULTS AND 20 CHILDREN

819
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
GUNNED DOWN AT THE SANDY HOOK

820
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HERE IN

821
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
NEWTOWN.
WE ALSO LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW

822
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
THEY DIED.

823
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
POLICE SAY THREE GUNS WERE FOUND

824
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
AT THE SCENE NEXT TO THE BODY OF

825
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
THE SHOOTER, ADAM LANZA.

826
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
BUT THE MEDICAL EXAMINER SAYS

827
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
ALL WOUNDS HE KNOWS OF WERE

828
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
CAUSED BY WHAT HE CALLS THE LONG

829
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
WEAPON, THAT RIFLE, THAT WE'RE

830
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
TALKING ABOUT.

831
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
THAT WOULD BE THE MODIFIED

832
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE THAT'S A

833
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
CIVILIAN VERSION OF THE MILITARY

834
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
M-16.
ONE OF THE VICTIMS OF THE

835
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
NEWTOWN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

836
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
MASSACRE WAS A 6-YEAR-OLD GIRL

837
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
NAMED EMILY PARKER.

838
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
HER FATHER GAVE A HEART

839
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
WRENCHING NEWS CONFERENCE A

840
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
LITTLE WHILE AGO.

841
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
LISTEN TO THIS.

842
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
MY DAUGHTER EMILIE WOULD BE ONE
OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE STANDING

843
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
AND GIVING HER LOVE AND SUPPORT

844
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS.

845
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF

846
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
PERSON THAT SHE IS.

847
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
NOT BECAUSE OF ANY PARENTING

848
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
THAT MY WIFE AND I COULD HAVE

849
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
DONE.

850
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
BUT BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE GIFTS

851
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY HER

852
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
HEAVENLY FATHER.

853
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

854
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

855
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

856
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

857
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
WAS, AND HOW MANY LIVES SHE WAS

858
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT TIME

859
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
HERE ON EARTH.

860
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

861
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
VERY LOVING.

862
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
EMILIE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO TRY

863
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
NEW THINGS, OTHER THAN FOOD.

864
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
SHE LOVED TO USE HER TALENTS TO

865
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
IT TOUCH THE LIVES OF EVERYONE

866
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
SHE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH.

867
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
SHE WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL ARTIST,

868
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
AND SHE ALWAYS CARRIED AROUND

869
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
HER MARKERS AND PENCILS SO SHE

870
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
NEVER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO

871
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
DRAW A PICTURE OR MAKE A CARD

872
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
FOR THOSE AROUND HER.

873
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF

874
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
TIMES EMILIE NOTICED SOMEONE

875
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
FEELING SAD OR FRUSTRATED AND

876
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
WOULD RUSH TO FIND A PIECE OF

877
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
PAPER TO DRAW THEM A PICTURE OR

878
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
TO WRITE THEM AN ENCOURAGING

879
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
NOTE.

880
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
EMILIE'S CARD-MAKING WAS
EXPRESSED BEAUTIFULLY THIS LAST

881
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
OCTOBER WHEN SHE PLACED A VERY

882
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
SPECIAL CARD SHE HAD MADE INTO

883
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
THE CASKET WITH HER GRANDPA, WHO

884
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
ALSO JUST RECENTLY DIED OF A

885
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
TRAGIC ACCIDENT.

886
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER TWO

887
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
LITTLE SISTERS IN DELIGHTING AND

888
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ, DANCE

889
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS IN
LIFE.

890
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
EMLIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS,

891
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE FLEESH

892
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
MEET HER WOULD AGREE THIS

893
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
WORLD'S A BERT PLACE BECAUSE SHE

894
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
HAS BEEN IN IT.

895
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I HAVE BEEN TEACHING HER

896
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
PORTUGUESE.

897
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
OUR LAST CONVERSATION WAS IN

898
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
PORTUGUESE.
AND SHE'S -- SHE TOLD ME GOOD

899
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
MORNING AND ASKED HOW I WAS

900
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
DOING AND I SAID I WAS DOING

901
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
WELL.
SHE SAID SHE LOVED ME, I GAVE

902
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT THE

903
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
DOOR.
THEY WERE BORN WITHIN THREE

904
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
YEARS OF EACH OTHER.

905
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
BY LAW THEY'RE VERY CLOSE.

906
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
SHE WAS TEACHING MY MIDDLE

907
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
DAUGHTER TO READ.

908
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
SHE WOULD HELP ME YOUNGEST

909
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
DAUGHTER HOW TO MAKE THINGS, DO

910
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
CRAFTS.

911
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
THEY LOOKED UP TO HER.

912
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
THEY LOOKED TO HER WHEN THEY

913
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
NEEDED COMFORT.

914
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
USUALLY THAT'S -- THAT'S SAVED

915
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
FOR HER MOM AND DAD BUT IT WAS

916
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
REALLY SWEET TO SEE THE TIMES

917
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
ONE OF THEM WOULD FALL OR GET

918
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
THEIR FEELINGS HURT, HOW THEY

919
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
WOULD RUN TO EMILIE GET SUPPORT

920
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
AND HUGS AND KISSES.

921
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
SHE WAS THE TYPE OF INSURGENT

922
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
COULD LIGHT UP THE ROOM.

923
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING KIND TO

924
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
SAY ABOUT ANYBODY.

925
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
HER LOVE AND STRENGTH SHE GAVE

926
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
US AND THE EXAMPLE SHE SHOWED TO

927
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
US IS REMARKABLE.

928
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON.

929
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
AND I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER

930
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000

NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
ANDERSON COOPER'S ON THE SCENE.

937
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I DON'T FOE WHAT ELSE TO SAY

938
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
AFTER HEARING A DAD LIKE THAT.

939
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
>> YEAH.

940
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
IT'S ALL JUST BEYOND WORDS

941
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
REALLY.

942
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
AND I SAID THIS LAST NIGHT, I

943
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
FEEL LIKE ALL OF THE WORDS THAT

944
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
WE SPEAK AND ALL OF THE WORDS

945
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
THAT CAN BE SPOKEN ARE JUST --

946
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
IT SEEMS SO SMALL IN THE FACE OF

947
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
THIS HORROR.

948
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000

949
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
HE'S A PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT.

00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
HE DEALS WITH SAVING PEOPLE'S

951
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
LIVES.
HE'S AT WORK AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

952
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
HE GETS A CALL.

953
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

954
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
>> UNIMAGINABLE.
>> YOU KNOW, ALL DAY LONG HERE

955
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GATHERING AND

956
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
IN SPOTS, IMPROMPTU SPOTS,

00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
PUBLIC VIGILS, OTHER TIMES ON A

958
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
STREET CORNER.

959
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
EVERYBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT
WHERE THEY WERE, WHAT THEY

960
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
HEARD, WHO THEY KNEW.

961
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000

962
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
FEELING HERE RIGHT NOW.

00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I MEAN THIS IS A COMMUNITY

964
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
WHICH -- IT SOUND CLICHE -- BUT

965
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
IT'S A COMMUNITY TRYING TO COME

00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
TOGETHER, TRYING TO HELP ONE

967
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
ANOTHER.

980
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
ESPECIALLY TO HAVE IT AROUND THE

So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

1093
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

1094
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It's not real.

1095
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

1096
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

1097

00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
TONE OF UNIYUAN BUT NOT TALKING

1279
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
ABOUT WHAT HE SEES AS THE

1280
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
SOLUTIONS TO AVERT SOMETHING

1281
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
LIKE THIS.
THE WHITE HOUSE FEELS THAT THEY

1282
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
DON'T WANT TO GET INTO SPECIFICS

1283
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
ABOUT POLICIES THEY MIGHT PURSUE

1284
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
IN THE WAKE OF THIS TRAGEDY.

1285
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
THEY'RE AFRAID THAT IT WOULD BE

1286
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, THAT IT WOULD

1287
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
BE INAPPROPRIATE CONSIDERING

1288
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
THIS TRAGEDY JUST HAPPENED.

1289
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
BUT THE SENSE THAT I GOTTEN,

1290
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
WOLF, IS WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA

1291
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
SAID YESTERDAY SHOULD BE SEEN

1292
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
VERY MUCH AS A PLEDGE TO DO

1293
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST TALK

1294
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.

1295
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
AND FOR RIGHT NOW, GUN RIGHTS

1296
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
ADVOCATES ARE BEING VERY QUIET.

1297
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
THEY ARE BASICALLY SAYING NO

1298
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
COMMENT.
BUT GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES ARE

1299
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
SAYING THEY WANT MORE THAN A

1300
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
VAGUE PLEDGE.

1301
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
JUST HOURS AFTER THE CONNECTICUT

1302
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
SHOOTING A PROMISE FROM

1303
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA TO TACKLE GUN
VIOLENCE.

1304
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME

1305
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
TOGETHER AND TAKE MEANINGFUL

1306
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
ACTION TO BE PREVENT MORE

1307
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS, REGARDLESS

1308
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
OF THE POLITICS.

1309
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
>> BUT WHAT EXACTLY DOES HE MEAN

1310
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
BY MEANINGFUL ACTION?

1311
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
KRIT IGS OF THE PRESIDENT'S

1312
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
RECORD ON THE ISSUE ARE PUSHING

1313
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
FOR PROPOSALS.

1314
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
CALLING FOR MEANINGFUL ACTION IS

1315
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
NOT ENOUGH.

1316
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
WE NEED IMMEDIATE ACTION.
WE HAVE HEARD ALL OF THE

1317
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
RHETORIC BEFORE.

1318
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
WHAT WE NEED IS LEADERSHIP,

1319
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
WHICH WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN FROM THE

1320
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
WHITE HOUSE OR THE CONGRESS.

1321
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
AS PRESIDENT OBAMA RAN FOR

1322
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
PRESIDENT IN 2008, OBAMA

1323
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
SUPPORTED REINSTATING A BAN ON

1324
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS.

1325
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
>> DON'T TELL ME WE CAN'T UPHOLD

1326
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
THE SECOND AMENDMENT WHILE

1327
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
KEEPING AK-47s OUT OF THE HANDS

1328
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
OF CRIMINALS.

1329
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
>> Reporter: ONCE ELECTED HE DID

1330
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
NOT MAKE GOOD ON HIS CAMPAIGN

1331
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
PLEDGE.
THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT

1332
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
GUN VIOLENCE GAVE THE PRESIDENT

1333
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
ACROSS THE BOARD F'S ON ITS

1334
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
REPORT CARD.

1335
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
>> THE SENATE WILL COME TO ORDER

1336
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
ORDER.
>> Reporter: A MAJOR OBSTACLE

1337
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
FOR THE PRESIDENT -- CONGRESS,
WHERE THERE'S BEEN LITTLE

1338
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
APPETITE TO TOUCH THE ISSUE.

1339
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
MULTIPLE BILLS HAVE BEEN

1340
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
INTRODUCED.
NOT A SINGLE ONE HAS MADE IT TO

1341
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE.

1342
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
THOSE INVOLVED IN THE DEBATE

1343
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000

1344
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000

HEALTH ISSUES TO MAKE SURE THEY

1351
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
ARE DISQUALIFIED FROM PURCHASING

1352
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
FIREARMS.

1353
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
POLLS SHOW AMERICANS HAVE BECOME

1354
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
ACCUSTOMED TO DAILY REPORTS OF

1355
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000

ISLAND TRAIN IN 1993 SAYS THE

1372
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
CONNECTICUT SHOOTING MAY BE WHAT

1373
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
FORCES PRESIDENT OBAMA AND

1374
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
CONGRESS TO FINALLY ADDRESS THE

1375
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
PROBLEM.

1376
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
>> LET'S FACE IT, WE NEED TO

1377
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
HAVE THE PRESIDENT AS THE BULLY

1378
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
PULL LIT ON TRYING TO GET

1379
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
SOMETHING DONE.

1380
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
THIS TIME, WHICH I SAW WAS

1381
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
DIFFERENT, THAT POLITICIANS THAT

1382
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
USUALLY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT WERE

1383
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
TALKING ABOUT IT.

1384
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
SO THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THIS

1385
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
TIME AROUND THERE IS A

1386
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
DIFFERENCE, MAYBE THE PENDULUM

1387
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
IS TURNING AND THE COUNTRY IS

1388
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
READY TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT THIS
ISSUE.

1389
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
>> WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN JAY

1390
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
CARNEY SAID NOW IS THE TIME TO

1391
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
HAVE SYMPATHY FOR FAMILIES.

1392
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
MAKING IT CLEAR HE DOESN'T THINK

1393
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
IT'S TIME TO ENGAGE IN A POLICY

1394
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
DEBATE.
BUT TALKING TO CONGRESSWOMAN

1395
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
McCARTHY TODAY, SHE SAID WHEN

1396
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
SHE HEARD THAT, SHE SAID SHE WAS

1397
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
UPSET AND CALLED UP THE WHITE

1398
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
HOUSE AND SAID WHAT ARE YOU

1399
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
TALKING ABOUT?

1400
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE

1401
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
BEEN TALKING ABOUT YEARS AGO.

1402
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000

DECISION, AS FAR AS THE NEXT

1406
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
SECRETARY OF STATE IS CONCERNED.

1407
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT, WOLF.

1408
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
WE'RE JUST FINDING OUT THAT

1409
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DECIDED ON

1410
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
SENATOR JOHN KERRY TO REPLACE

1411
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
HILLARY CLINTON AS THE SECRETARY

1412
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
OF STATE.
THIS IS COMING TO CNN FROM A

1413
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
DEMOCRAT WHO SPOKE WITH KERRY.

1442
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS IS

1443
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
A TOWN FOREVER CHANGED, BUT A

00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
