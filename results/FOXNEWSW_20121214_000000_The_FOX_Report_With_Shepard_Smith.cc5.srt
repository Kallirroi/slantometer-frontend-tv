ENTITLEMENTS AND SPENDING ON

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
THE ENTITLEMENTS.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
THAT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING OUR

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
FRAMERS THOUGHT ABOUT

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
BECAUSE -- WE DIDN'T HAVE A

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
WELFARE STATE IN THOSE DAYS.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
>> GLEN, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
>> I'M FINE.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
>> OKAY, GOOD.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BY THE WAY.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
>> I LOVE LIVE TV.

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
>> THAT'S OKAY.

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
CRITICIZE THE WELFARE STATE.

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
[ LAUGHTER ]

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
>> Bret: THERE YOU GO.

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
UNAFRAID.

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000

U.N. AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE IS

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
OUT AS THE NEXT SECRETARY OF

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
STATE.
SO WHO WILL REPLACE HILLARY

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
CLINTON?

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
BORDER.
STILL, THE MEXICAN POLICE PUT

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000

LOCKED UP FOR MONTHS.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
>> HE IS TOUGH.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
SOMEBODY IS MAKING EXTORTION

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
DEMANDS AND THAT SAY IT'S TIME

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000

AS USUAL HE HAS PLENTY TO SAY.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
>> I DON'T THINK ANYBODY

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
THINKS I MURDERED MY NEIGHBOR,

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
EXCEPT YOU, THE PRESS.

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
ABOUT THE CORRUPTION, THE

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
HARASSMENT.

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000

WORD OF A PLAN THAT INVOLVES

57
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
KIDNAPPING.
MULTIPLE MURDER AND CASTRATION

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
BY SHEARS.

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
>> RACING A HORSE.

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE HOW IT

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
ENDED.

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'M HARRIS FAULKNER IN TONIGHT

UNITED NATIONS AMBASSADOR

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
SUSAN RICE IS OUT OF THE

RUNNING.
TO BE THE NEXT SECRETARY OF

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
STATE.

68
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
SHE ASKED PRESIDENT OBAMA TO

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
TAKE HER OFF THE LIST AND HE

70
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
SAYS HE HAS ACCEPTED HER

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
DECISION.
BUT HE IS BLASTING HER

72
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
REPUBLICAN CRITICS FOR WHAT HE

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
CALLS UNFAIR AND MISLEADING

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
ATTACKS ON RICE.

75
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
SOME REPUBLICAN SENATORS THREB

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
TO BLOCK RICE'S

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
BECAUSE OF HER COMMENTS ABOUT

78
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
THAT ATTACK ON THE OUTPOST IN

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
BENGHAZI.
TERRORISTS KILLED OUR U.S.

AMERICANS ON SEPTEMBER 11TH OF

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
THIS YEAR.

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
THREE DAYS LATER AMBASSADOR

85
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
RICE WENT ON THE TALK SHOW

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
CIRCUIT AND SAID SEVERAL TIMES

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
U.S. OFFICIALS BELIEVED THE

88
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
VIOLENCE WAS A SPONTANEOUS

89
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
REACTION OVER PROTESTS TO

90
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
ANTI-MUSLIM VIDEO NOT A

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
PREPLANNED TERRORIST ATTACK.

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS SAY

93
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
THEY GAVE HER THOSE TALKING

94
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
POINTS BUT THOSE OPPONENTS DID

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
NOT BACK DOWN AND TODAY

96
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
AMBASSADOR RICE SENT THE

97
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT,

98
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
QUOTE:  I AM NOW CONVINCED

99
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
THAT THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS

100
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
WOULD BE LENGTHY, DISRUPTIVE

101
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
AND COSTLY TO YOU AND TO OUR

102
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
MOST PRESSING NATIONAL AND

103
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
INTERNATIONAL PRIORITIES.

104
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THAT TRADEOFF IS SIMPLY NOT

105
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
WORTH IT TO OUR COUNTRY, END

106
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
QUOTE.
WE HAVE TEAM FOX COVERAGE NOW.

107
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
CATHERINE HERRIDGE IS LIVE ON

108
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
CAPITOL HILL WHERE LAWMAKERS

109
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
GOT ANOTHER CLASSIFIED

110
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
BRIEFING ON BENGHAZI TODAY.

111
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
FIRST THOUGH TO ED HENRY LIVE

112
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

113
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
ED, WHAT'S THE REACTION THERE?

114
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
GOOD EVENING, HARRIS.

115
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THERE IS DISAPPOINTMENT HERE

116
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
BECAUSE I SAID OVER THE

117
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
DECISION LAST FEW DAYS, HE

118
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
WANTED SUSAN RICE TO

119
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
AMBASSADOR UP TO SECRETARY OF

120
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
STATE.
HE KNEW IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH

121
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
OF A BRUISING BATTLE, NOT JUST

122
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THREATENED FILIBUSTER FROM

123
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS LIKE

124
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
JOHN MCCAIN AND LYNSEY GRAM,

125
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
COLLINS WHO WOULD BE LIKELY TO

126
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S

127
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
NOMINEES SAID SHE WAS TROUBLED

128
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
BY THE POTENTIAL NOMINATION.

129
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO PUT THE

130
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
BEST FACE ON THIS IN A

131
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
STATEMENT WHERE HE SAID,

132
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
QUOTE:  I HAVE EVERY

133
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
CONFIDENCE THAT SUSAN WAS

134
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
LIMITLESS CAPABILITY TO SERVE

135
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
OUR COUNTRY NOW AND IN THE

136
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
YEARS TO COME.

137
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
IN FACT, WE'RE TOLD SHE IS

138
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
EXPECTED TO AT LEAST STAY ON

139
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
AS U.N. AMBASSADOR IF NOT TAKE

140
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
ANOTHER POSITION.

141
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
SUSAN RICE, BY THE WAY, IN

142
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
THAT LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT,

143
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
WENT ON TO SAY, QUOTE:  WE

144
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
CANNOT AFFORD SUCH AN

145
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
IRRESPONSIBLE DISTRACTION FROM
THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES

146
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
FACING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

147
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT SHE WAS

148
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
REFERRING NOT JUST TO THE

149
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
THREATENED FILIBUSTER BUT THE

150
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
FACT THAT WE HAVE A WHOLE HOST

151
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
OF INTERNATIONAL ISSUES AS

152
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
WELLS THE PRESIDENT IN THE

153
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
MIDDLE OF THESE VERY TENSE

154
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS AS WELL,

155
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
HARRIS.
>> Harris: AND SOME ACTIVITY

156
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
ABOUT THE GROUP THAT SURROUNDS

157
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THE PRESIDENT AS A CABINET.

158
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS

159
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
JUST A FIRST IN SERIES OF

160
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
MOVES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
TOP DEMOCRATS ARE TELLING ME

161
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
THAT CHUCK HAGEL, THE FORMER

162
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
REPUBLIC SENATOR IS NOW THE

163
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
LEADING CONTENDER TO BECOME

164
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
THE NEXT DEFENSE SECRETARY.

165
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
LEON PANETTA EXPECTED TO STEP

166
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
DOWN IN THE BOOKS AHEAD.

167
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
INTERESTING BECAUSE IT COULD

168
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
GIVE THE PRESIDENT

169
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
BIPARTISANSHIP IN THE CAB

170
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
NEVMENT ALSO WHAT'S
INTERESTING IS THAT THERE

171
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
MIGHT BE A WHOLE SERIES OF

172
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
OTHER SHUFFLES.

173
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'M TOLD SHE IS BEING LOOKED

174
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
AT FOR NATIONAL SECURITY

175
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
ADVISOR INSIDE THE WHITE

176
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
HOUSE.
THE KEY BEING SHE WOULDN'T

177
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
NEED SENATE CONFIRMATION.

178
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
REPUBLICANS COULD NOT
FILIBUSTER IT.

179
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
SHE WOULD REPLACE TOM DONILIN

180
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
BY THE WAY.

181
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
SOME PEOPLE TALKING HIM UP TO

182
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
BE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF.

183
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
THE CURRENT CHIEF OF STAFF

184
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
THERE JACK LEW MIGHT BECOME

185
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
THE TREASURY SECRETARY.

186
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
SO BASICALLY IT'S A GAME OF

187
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
MUSICAL CHAIRS,.

188
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000

279
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
THAT IF THINGS MOVE A LITTLE

280
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000

INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN PRETTY

297
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
SLOW-GOING.
IN PART BECAUSE THE LIBYAN

298
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
GOVERNMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, DOES

299
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THE

300
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
EASTERN PART OF BENGHAZI

301
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000

WHERE YOU FIND BENGHAZI.

303
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
THAT'S RATHER IN THE CONTROL

304
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
OUT OOF POWER.

560
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
ASSAD WANTS MOST POWERFUL ALLY

561
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
SEEMS TO BE LOSING HOPE.

562
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
TODAY A RUSSIAN OFFICIAL SAID

563
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE REBELS

564
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
MIGHT WIN THE CIVIL WAR.

565
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
AS HE PUT IT, WE HAVE

566
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
THE FACTS.

567
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
HE ALSO REVEALED MOSCOW IS

568
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
MAKING PLANS TO EVACUATE

569
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
THOUSANDS OF RUSSIAN CITIZENS

570
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
FROM SYRIA.

571
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
THE FALLOUT OF ASSAD WOULD

572
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
ALSO BE A HUGE BLOW TO HIS

573
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
OTHER ALLIES, IRAN AND THE

574
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
TERROR GROUP HEZBOLLAH.

575
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
"THE FOX REPORT'S"
CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN HUNT

576
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
LIVE IN OUR NEW YORK CITY
NEWSROOM NOW.

577
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
JONATHAN, THIS CHANGE OF TONE

578
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
FROM THE HUTIONS SEEMS TO BE

579
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
VERY SIGNIFICANT.
>> YEAH IT, CERTAINLY IS.

580
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
BECAUSE RUSSIA REMEMBER HAS

581
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
BEEN PRESIDENT BASHAR ASSAD'S

582
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
GREATEST ALLY AND PROTECTER.

583
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
IF THEY ARE CHANGING THEIR

584
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
TONE NOW, ACCEPTING THAT THE

585
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
REBELS ARE GETTING CLOSER AND

586
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
CLOSER TO ASSAD'S POWER CENTER

587
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
IN DAMASCUS THROUGH THE

588
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
VIOLENCE THAT WE HAVE SEEN

589
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
INTENSIFYING OVER THE LAST

590
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
COUPLE OF WEEKS, IT SIGNIFIES

591
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE

592
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
REALIZING THAT THEIR GREATEST

593
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
FRIEND IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS

594
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
ABOUT TO BE OUT OF POWER AND

595
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
THEY BETTER PRETTY QUICKLY

596
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
START MAKING SOME NEW FRIENDS

597
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
AMONG THE REBEL OPPOSITION.

598
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE SIMPLY

599
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
PLEASED TO SEE THE RUSSIANS

600
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
FINALLY FACING UP TO REALITY,

601
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
LISTEN.

602
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
>> WE AGREE THAT ASSAD WILL

603
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
NOT BE A PART OF SYRIANS

604
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
FUTURE.

605
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
WE HAVE NOTED AS THE MEDIA HAS

606
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
THE PROGRESS THAT THE

607
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
OPPOSITION HAS BEEN MAKING.

608
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
WE STILL BELIEVE THAT FOR THE

609
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
SAKE OF THE SYRIAN PEOPLE

610
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
ASSAD OUGHT TO LEAVE NOW.

611
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
>> NOW THE QUESTIONS REMAIN OF

612
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
COURSE HOW LONG DOES PRESIDENT

613
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
ASSAD -- CAN PRESIDENT ASSAD

614
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
HOLD ON?

615
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
HOW DESPERATE DOES HE GET

616
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
WHILE HE DOES THAT AND IN THAT

617
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
DESPERATION, WHAT KIND OF

618
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
EXTREME MEASURES MIGHT HE

619
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
TAKE?
WHAT KIND OF WEAPONS MIGHT HE

620
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
USE AGAINST THE OPPOSITION AND

621
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
HIS OWN PEOPLE, HARRIS.

622
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
>> Harris: SYRIAN OFFICIALS
SEEM TO BE IN A STATE OF

623
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
DENIAL ABOUT ALL OF.

624
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
THIS CERTAINLY.
WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM

625
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
PRESIDENT ASSAD HIMSELF.

626
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
BUT WE DID HEAR EXTENSIVELY

627
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
TODAY FROM HIS INFORMATION

628
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
MINISTER WHO TROTTED OUT SOME

629
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
WELL WARNED GOVERNMENT

630
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

631
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
FOR INSTANCE, SAYING THAT THE

632
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
WESTERN ACCUSATIONS THAT THE

633
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS USED

634
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
SCUD MISSILES IS JUST A LIE.

635
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
THAT THE TALK OF ASSAD'S DAYS

636
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
BEING NUMBERED IS AN ATTEMPT

637
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY

638
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
TO KIND OF CREATE A

639
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY.
HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE

640
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
RUSSIAN POSITION AND RATHER

641
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
CURIOUSLY SAID IT HASN'T

642
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
CHANGED AT ALL.

643
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
LISTEN.

644
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
>> I DON'T THINK THERE ANY

645
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
CHANGE IN THE RUSSIAN

646
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
POSITIONS.

647
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
THE ONLY THING THAT THE

648
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
AMERICAN POSITION CAME CLOSER
TO THE RUSSIAN POSITION.

649
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
FOR EXAMPLE, THE RUSSIANS HAVE

650
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
LISTED A TERRORIST GROUP, THAT

651
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
MEANS THE AMERICANS ARE COMING

652
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
CLOSER TO THE RUSSIAN'S SIDE.

653
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'M CONVINCED THERE IS NO

654
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
CHANGE IN --

655
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
>> WHETHER THAT WAS

656
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING OR

657
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
NOT, IT CERTAINLY SEEMS

658
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
DIVORCE FROM REALITY TO

659
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
SUGGEST THAT THE U.S. POSITION

660
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
IS MOVING CLOSER TO THE

661
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
RUSSIANS.

662
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
RATHER THAN VISA VERSA.

663
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
REMEMBER, SADDAM HUSSEIN'S

664
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
INFORMATION MINISTER DURING

665
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
THE WAR IN IRAQ SEEMS WE MAY

666
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
HAVE ANOTHER BAGHDAD BUB ON

667
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
HER HANDS, HARRIS.

668
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
>> Harris: DIVORCE INDEED.

669
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
MAY IT WILL STARTED TO SINK IN

670
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
WITH THEY START PULLING OUT OF

671
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
THAT COUNTRY.

672
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
IT IS NOT LOOKING SO GOOD FOR

673
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
THE MAN WHO CALLED A FORMER

674
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
AMERICAN PRESIDENT THE DEVIL.

675
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HUGO

676
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
CHAVEZ SUFFERED BLEEDING

677
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
DURING HIS CANCER SURGERY IN

678
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
CUBA ACCORDING TO THE

679
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
COUNTRY'S INFORMATION

680
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
MINISTER.

681
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
DOCTORED REPORTEDLY HAD TO

682
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
PERFORM CORRECTIVE MEASURES TO

683
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
STOP THE BLEEDING.

684
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
CHAVEZ JUST WON A SIX YEAR

685
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
TERM, BRAND NEW AS PRESIDENT.

686
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
IT'S APPEARING MORE UNLIKELY

687
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
THAT HE WILL ACTUALLY BE WELL

688
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
ENOUGH TO RETURN FROM CUBA IN

689
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000

690
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
INAUGURATION.

691
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
THE REMAINS OF THE SINGER AND

692
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
REALITY STAR JENNY RIVERA NOW

693
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
HEADED BACK HOME TO THE UNITED

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000

THAT'S ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT

695
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
OFFICIALS IN MEXICO.

696
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
SHE DIED THERE ON SUNDAY WHEN

697
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
A LEHRER JET SHE CRASHED ON

698
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
CRASHED AFTER TAKING OFF IN

699

THE NORTHERN PART OF THE

700
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
COUNTRY.
RIVERA WAS ENORMOUSLY POPULAR

701
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
WITH MORE THAN 15 MILLION

702
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000

707
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
SOME SOUVENIR HUNTERS.

709
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
ARRESTED TWO POLICE OFFICERS

710

FOR STEALING ITEMS FROM THE

719
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
THE FAMILY OF A FORMER U.S.

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
MARINE SAYS HE IS STUCK IN A

721
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
PRISON INSIDE MEXICO ALL

722
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
BECAUSE OF AN HONEST MISTAKE.

723
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
THERE IS WORD NOW HIS LIFE

724
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
COULD BE IN DANGER.

725
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
RETURNING TO U.S. LAWMAKERS

726
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
FOR HELP.

727
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
PLUS, THE VERY UNUSUAL

728
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
CRIMINAL CASE INVOLVING

729
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
PRUNING SHEARS.
A PAISLEY TIE, AND AN APPARENT

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
PLOT TO KILL THIS GUY, THE

731
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
BEEBS.
POP STAR JUSTIN BEACH AS WE

732
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
APPROACH THE BOTTOM OF THE

733
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
HOUR.
TOP OF THE NEWS.

734
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Playing sports is just
my whole life.

735
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Looking back if it wasn't for
Shriners Hospital,

736
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
things would just be really,
really different.

737
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I lost my leg when I was a kid.

738
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
There was a time when
I felt like I wasn't

739
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
going to be able to
walk again...

740
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It was a pretty bad accident

741
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But Shriners showed me who
I could be again.

742
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
They turned my whole

747
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And also to build my career.

748
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So I'm not about to always let
my frequent bladder urges,

749
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
or the worry my pipes
might leak get in the way

750
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
of my busy lifestyle.

751
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That's why I take care,
with VESIcare.

752
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Once-daily VESIcare can help
control your bladder muscle

753
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and is proven to treat
overactive bladder

754
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
with sympts of

755
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
frequent urges and leaks
day and night.

756
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
If you have certain stomach or
glaucoma problems,

757
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
or trouble emptying
your bladder,

758
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
do not take VESIcare.

759
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
VESIcare may cause allergic
reactions that may be serious.

760
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
If you experience swelling of
the face, lips,

761
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
throat or tongue,

762
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
stop taking VESIcare
and get emergency help.

763
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Tell your doctor right away if
you have severe abdominal pain,

764
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
or become constipated for three
or more days.

765
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
VESIcare may
cause blurred vision,

766
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
so use caution while driving
or doing unsafe tasks.

767
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Common side effects
are dry mouth, constipation,

768
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
and indigestion.

769
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I've worked hard
to get to where I am...

770
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
and I've got better
aces to go

771
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
than always
going to the bathroom.

772
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000

HE SAYS HE HAD NOTHING TO DO

951
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
WITH IT AND ACCUSATIONS ARE

952
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
PART OF A GOVERNMENT PLOT.

953
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
THEN McAFEE WENT ON THE RUN.

984
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
ANY CHANCE THAT THE U.S. SENDS

985
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
HIM BACK TO BELIZE AT THIS

986
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
POINT?
>> HARRIS, THAT CHANCE

987
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
ABSOLUTELY STILL EXISTS BUT IT

988
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
DEPENDS ON THE POLICE IN BLEEZ

989
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
IF THEY CHANGE PERSON OF

990
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000

1002
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
HE INSISTS HE HE HAS NOTHING

1003
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
TO HIDE.

1004
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
>> I WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH

1007
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
THE MURDER IN BELIZE.

1008
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
THIS IS NOT ABOUT A MURDER IN

1009
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
BELIZE.

1010
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
>> SO AT THIS POINT THERE IS

1011
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
ABSOLUTELY NO EXTRADITION

1012
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
REQUEST FROM BELIZE.

1013
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
