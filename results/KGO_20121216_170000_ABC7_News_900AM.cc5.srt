BUT OVERALL, THE MORE

1154
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
ORGANIZED RAIN HOLDS OFF

1155
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
TONIGHT -- UNTIL TONIGHT WITH

1156
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000

WE ARE LOOKING AT A FEW LIGHT

1164
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
AREAS OF RAIN.

1165
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
THE CLOUD COVER, THE MIST AND

1166
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
THE DRIZZLE HAS BEEN TO THE

1167
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
NORTH OF THE GOLDEN GATE.

1168
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
SAN FRANCISCO JUST SAW A

00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
THIS MORNING.

1175
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
SO WHERE THE SUN HAS BEEN

1176
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000

1179
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
THOSE SOUTHLY WINDS AHEAD OF

1180
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
THE NEXT ANEMIC SYSTEM THAT

1181
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000

1182
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
ACTUALLY YESTERDAY WAS THE

1183
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
ANEMIC SYSTEM.

1184
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
THE ONE TONIGHT IS GOING TO

1185
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
HALF AN INCH TO AN INCH IN THE

1187
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
NORTH BAY.

1188
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
10 DEGREES WARMER THIS MORNING

1189
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000

1190
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
DEGREES WARMER IN THE SOUTH

1191
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000

1192
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
SO A FEW SHOWERS THIS

1193
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000

THE RAIDERS GAME, YOU MIGHT

1194
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
SEE A STRAY SHOWER.

1195
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
CLOUDY AND A FEW SUNNY

1196
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
BREAKS.

1197
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
THE NEXT SYSTEM COMES ON

1198
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
THROUGH WITH A BIG BREAK AFTER

1199
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
THAT ONE.

1200
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
THAT IS PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE WE

1201
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
IT AS WE HEAD TOWARD THE END

1203
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000

HERE IS THE TIMING AND WHAT TO

1207
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
EXPECT TODAY.

1208
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
THE SCATTERED SHOWERS AROUND

1209
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
THE BAY FROM THE NORTH BAY TO

1210
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000

BY 8:00 TONIGHT IT IS PUSHING

1214
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000

CHRISTMAS EVE AND CHRISTMAS

1243
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000

1288
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
IT IS A SMALLER BOOK, BUT IT

1289
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
IS A TRILOGY AND THAT'S WHY

1290
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
SCENES GO ON SO LONG.

1291
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
