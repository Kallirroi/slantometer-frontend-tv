FROM OFFICIALS.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
WE WERE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH ONE

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
WOMAN WHO WAS INSIDE THE

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, JUST A FEW

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
MOMENTS AGO.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
HER NAME, MARY ANNE JACOBS AND

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
SHE'S A SCHOOL LIBRARY CLERK

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HER ON

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
THE SCREEN THERE AND THAT'S

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
HER HUSBAND SHE WAS HUGGING

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
AFTER SPEAKING TO JOURNALISTS.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
MARY ANNE'S STORIES, YESTERDAY

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
SHE WAS WITH 18 FOURTH GRADERS

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
IN THE LIBRARIES AND SHE HEARD

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
A NOISE OVER THE INTERS COME,

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
AND RUMBLINGS AND DO YOU KNOW

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
IF YOUR INTERCOM IS ON.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
AND THE SECRETARY SAID THERE'S

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
A SHOOTING.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
AND SHE SAYS THAT SECRETARY IS

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
A HERO TODAY.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
AND SHE WENT OUT INTO THE

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
HALLS, AND SAID WE'RE IN

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
LOCKDOWN AND RETURNED TO THE

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
LIBRARY AND TOOK HER 18 FOURTH

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
GRADERS BEHIND STACKS OF BOOKS

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
AND THEY WERE TRYING TO HIDE

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
AND REALIZED THEY DIDN'T HAVE

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
THE COVERAGE THEY NEEDED AND

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
DOORS WERE NOT LOCKED.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
UPON HEARING THAT AND LEARNING

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
THAT, MARY ANNE AND A FEW

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
OTHERS IN THE ROOM MOVED THE

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
18 FOURTH GRADERS INTO A

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
STORAGE CLOSET.

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
LOCKED THE DOOR AND PUSHED A

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
FILE CABINET AGAINST IT, THEY

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
WERE LUCKY ENOUGH THAT THEY

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
HAD SOME CELL PHONE RECEPTION

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
IN THAT STORAGE ROOM, THEY

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
WERE ABLE TO REACH THE OUTSIDE

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
AND MARY ANNE SAID THEY WERE

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
ALSO LUCKY BECAUSE THEY HAD

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
SOME PAPER AND SOME CRAYONS

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
AND ASKING SOME QUESTIONS AND

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
THEY WERE ASKING QUESTIONS,

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
BUT KEEPING THEM CALM AND AS

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
THEY COULD HEAR WHAT THEY KNEW

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
WERE GUNSHOTS IN THE SCHOOL

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
AND MARY ANNE DOESN'T KNOW THE

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
TIME LINE FOR SURE, BUT THINKS

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THEY WERE THERE FOR ABOUT AN

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
HOUR AND HEARD BANGING ON THE

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
DOOR AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
OPEN IT AS I'M SURE YOU COULD

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
IMAGINE AND SHE GOT A CALL THE

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
POLICE WERE OUT THERE AND

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
MOVED THE FILE CABINET AND

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
ASKED FOR A BADGE UNDERNEATH

104
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THE DOOR AND OUTSIDE THERE

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
WERE 15 STATE POLICE OUTSIDE

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
AND AT THAT MOMENTS SHE SAYS

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
SHE KNEW THAT THE CHILDREN

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
KNEW THIS WAS DIFFERENT.

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
AT THAT TIME, JOHN, THEY WENT

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
TO THE FIREHOUSE AND AS WE

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000

190
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
TALKED TO ANOTHER TEACHER IN

191
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
THE SCHOOL, FROM ANOTHER

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
DISTRICT WHO IS FAMILIAR WITH

193
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THE SECURITY PROCEDURES.

194
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
AS SOON AS ANYONE WANTS TO GET

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
IN, INCLUDING A PARENT, THEY

196
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
NEED TO BASICALLY APPEAR ON A

197
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
CAMERA THAT THEN PRESENTS

198
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
THEIR IMAGE TO SOMEONE IN THE

199
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
FRONT OFFICE AND THEN SOMEONE

200
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
IN THE FRONT OFFICE NEEDS TO

201
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
BUZZ THE DOOR, LIKE IN AN

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
APARTMENT BUILDING, TO LET

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
THEM IN AND THEN THAT PERSON

204
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
NEEDS TO GO IMMEDIATELY TO THE

205
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
OFFICE.
THE OFFICERS ARE NOW SAYING

206
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
THAT IT APPEARS THE GUNMAN

207
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
SHOT HIS WAY IN.

208
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
>> IT'S INTERESTING, WITH THE

209
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
TIMING ON THIS, AGAIN, WE'RE

210
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER

211
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

212
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
BUT WE KNOW THAT THE SCHOOL

213
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
PUTS THE SECURITY PROCEDURES

214
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
IN PLACE, LOCKED THEIR DOORS

215
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
AROUND 9:30 IN THE MORNING.

216
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
BUT, THE TIME LINE, TELL US A

217
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
LITTLE ABOUT THE RESPONSE

218
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
TIME.
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE AT LEAST

219
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
FROM WHAT WE KNOW, THAT THIS

220
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY.

221
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
>> IT DOES SEEM LIKE IT

222
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
HAPPENED QUICKLY AND SOMETHING

223
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
ELSE THAT MARY ANNE JACOB TOLD

224
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
US, YOU MENTION THAT SHE

225
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
CALLED THE SECRETARY AND THE

226
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
SECRETARY PICKED UP THE PHONE,

227
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
EVEN THOUGH THE GUN--

228
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
SHE WAS APPARENTLY IN SIGHT OF

229
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THE GUNMAN AND SAID THEY'RE

230
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
SHOOTING AND THEN THE TEACHER,

231
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
OR THE LIBRARY CLERK, RAN OUT

232
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
AND YELLED LOCKDOWN, WITHIN

233
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
THAT TIME, THEY LOCKED DOWN

234
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
MOST OF THE CLASSROOMS.

235
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
WE ALSO HEARD FROM THAT

236
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
LIBRARY CLERK, HER

237
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
UNDERSTANDING EVEN THOUGH SHE

238
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
WAS IN THE BACK OF THE SCHOOL
WITH THE FOURTH GRADERS, HER

239
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

240
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
GUNMAN ENTERED THE FRONT DOOR

241
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
AND THEN SKIPPED THE FIRST

242
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
CLASSROOM AND WENT AND SHOT UP

243
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
THE SECOND AND THIRD CLASSROOM

244
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
IN A ROW AND SHE SAID THAT

245
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
WHEN THEY WERE AT THE

246
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
FIREHOUSE, ALL THE TEACHERS

247
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
LINED UP BY GRADE AND THEY HAD

248
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
ALL THE STUDENTS LINED UP

249
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
BEHIND THEM FROM THEIR CLASSES

250
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
SO THEY COULD GET A HEAD

251
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
COUNTS AND IT WAS AT THE

252
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
FIREHOUSE, SHORTLY AFTER, SHE

253
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
SAID I THINK AROUND 10:30 OR

254
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
11:30 IN THE MORNING, THAT

255
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
THEY REALIZED WHEN THEY WERE

256
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
DOING THE HEAD COUNT BY CLASS,

257
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
THAT TWO ENTIRE CLASSES SHE

258
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THINKS THEY WERE FIRST GRADE

259
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
CLASSES WERE NOT THERE EXCEPT

260
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
FOR FEW KIDS.

261
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
>> WE'VE HEARD SO MANY

262
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
DIFFERENT CONFLICTING REPORTS

263
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
AND OUR VIEWERS HAVE HEARD A

264
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASS AND WE'VE

265
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
HEARD NOW FROM A FEW PEOPLE

266
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
HERE, FIRST GRADE.

267
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE

268
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
REALLY WAITING FOR IS

269
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
CONFIRMATION OF THE NAMES OF

270
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
THE DECEASED.

271
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
>> AND WE WERE TOLD THE LAST

272
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
UPDATE WE GOT AROUND EIGHT

273
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND

274
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
AUTHORITIES AT THAT POINT

275
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
ANNOUNCEDED MEDICAL EXAMINER'S

276
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
OFFICE AFTER A FULL DAY OF

277
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
POLICE INVESTIGATION AS

278
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
ALLOWED IN AND IDENTIFYING THE

279
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
YOUNG VICTIMS ON SITE AND

280
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
REPORTED BY LOCAL OUTLETS HERE

281
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
THAT A TEMPORARY MORGUE WAS

282
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
SET UP SOMEWHERE ON THE SCHOOL

283
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
GROUNDS AND THAT'S WHERE THE

284
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
AUTHORITIES WENT AND TOOK

285
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE YOUNG

286
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
VICTIMS AND THE AUTHORITIES

287
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
WOULD THEN TAKE THOSE

288
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
PHOTOGRAPHS TO SHOW THE

289
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
PARENTS AND WE'RE TOLD THAT

290
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

291
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
GOING ON THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.

292
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
ONE AT A TIME.

293
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
AND IT'S TOUGH TO--

294
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
>> IT'S TOUGH TO REPORT.

295
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
>> AND THINK ABOUT.

296
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
>> I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT

297
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
WE'VE ALL ENCOUNTERED HERE.

298
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
YOU KNOW, JON, PETTER AND I

299
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
WERE SITTING WAITING FOR THE

300
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
PRESS CONFERENCE TO BEGIN AND

301
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
EVEN AMONG SOME OF OUR FELLOW

302
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
JOURNALISTS WAITING FOR THE

303
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
NEWS CONFERENCE AND SOME WERE

304
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
EXCHANGING STORIES AND HOW

305
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
THEY WERE CONNECTED TO WHAT

306
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
HAPPENED AT THE ELEMENTARY

307
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
SCHOOL.

308
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
MANY OF THEM IN TEARS.

309
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
AND IT JUST SORT OF SHOWS US

310
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
HOW CLOSE KNIT IN COMMUNITY?

311
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
AND MANY POINTED OUT IT'S NOT
JUST NEWTOWN, THERE'S A SERIES

312
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
OF TOWNS AROUND THIS AREA AND

313
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
EVERYONE HAS TO PASS THROUGH

314
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
EACH OTHER'S TOWNS TO GET TO

315
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
WHERE THEY'RE GOING, SO A VERY

316
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
CLOSE KNIT COMMUNITY AND SO

317
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
MANY AFFECTED HERE.

318
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
>> I THINK EVERYBODY CAN

319
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
PERHAPS UNDERSTAND HOW AWFUL

320
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
IT IS TO HAVE THIS KIND OF

321
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
TRAGEDY, THIS KIND OF MAYHEM

322
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
SUDDENLY INVADE THEIR

323
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
COMMUNITIES WHEN IT'S

324
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
ABSOLUTELY SO UNEXPECTED.

325
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
AND AS JENNA WAS JUST SAYING,

326
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
THE CONNECTICUT AUTHORITIES

327
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH THE

328
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
NIGHT, TRYING TO POSITIVELY

329
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
IDENTIFY THE BODIES.

330
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT PROCESS

331
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
WITH DR. MICHAEL BADEN, A

332
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGIST AND ALSO

333
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

334
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
ADULTS CARRY I.D. GENERALLY,

335
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
IN FACT, WITH THE GUNMAN IN

336
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
THIS CASE, THE FACT THAT HE

337
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
WAS APPARENTLY CARRYING HIS

338
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
BROTHER'S I.D. IS PART OF WHAT

339
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
LED TO THE MISIDENTIFICATION.

340
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WITH

341
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
CHILDREN.
SO WHAT IS THE PROCESS?

342
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
>> WELL, THE PROCESS NOW IS

343
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
MORE INSTEAD OF TAKING THE

344
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
FAMILY TO SEE THE BODY,

345
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
ESPECIALLY IN THE SCHOOL, IS

346
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE

347
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
FACE OF THE CHILD AND SHOW

348
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
THEM TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO

349
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
ARE WAITING, IDENTIFY EACH

350
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
BODY BY PHOTOGRAPH AND THEN

351
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
THEY CAN REMOVE THE BODY TO

352
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
FARMINGTON IS THE MAIN MEDICAL

353
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
EXAMINER'S OFFICE.

354
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
DO WHATEVER FURTHER EVALUATION

355
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THEY'VE

356
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
GOT TO DESCRIBE AND ESTABLISH

357
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
EACH BULLET WOUND, THEY

358
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
PROBABLY, THEY HAVE TO TAKE

359
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
NOT ONLY PHOTOGRAPHS, BUT ALSO

360
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
X-RAYS AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE

361
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THE X-RAY MACHINES TO SEE IF

362
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
THERE ARE ANY BULLETS IN THE

363
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
BODIES.
>> DOES IT HAVE TO BE A PARENT

364
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
WHO MAKES THE IDENTIFICATION?

365
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
COULD IT BE A RELATIVE.

366
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
>> A RELATIVE OR CLOSE FRIEND.

367
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE

368
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
PARENT.

369
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
THAT'S RIGHT, SOMETIMES THE

370
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
PARENTS CAN BE SPARED THAT BY

371
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
OTHERS WHO KNOW THE FAMILY

372
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
WELL.

373
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
>> IN YOUR EXPERIENCE, I MEAN,

374
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE HAVING TO

375
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
DO THAT.

376
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'VE GOT FOUR KIDS MYSELF.

377
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE HAVING TO DO

378
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
IT.

379
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE DO PARENTS

380
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
WANT TO--

381
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
NOT CHILDREN.

382
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
>> BE INVOLVED?

383
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
>> CHILDREN ARE SUPPOSED TO

384
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
IDENTIFY PARENTS.

385
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
>> EXACTLY.
>> NOT THE REVERSE, AND THIS

386
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
IS SUCH A LARGE TRAGEDY AND I

387
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
THINK PART OF WHAT'S BEING

388
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
LOOKED INTO NOW IS WHY DID

389
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
ADAM DO THIS AND IT APPEARS TO

390
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
ME THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING

391
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
WITH HIS MOTHER THAT HE KILLED

392
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
HIS MOTHER FIRST AND MAYBE HE

393
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
WAS JEALOUS THAT HIS MOTHER

394
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
THOUGHT MORE OF THE

395
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN SHE MAY

396
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
HAVE WORKED WITH AT ONE TIME

397
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
THAN HIM AND HE GOES OUT IN A

398
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
CRAZY WAY, KILLS ALL THE

399
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
CHILDREN, JUST VERY UNIQUE AND

400
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
VERY UNPREDICTABLE.

401
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
>> IT'S GIT'S GOT TO BE

402
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
FRUSTRATING FOR THE PARENTS,

403
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
WE'RE GOING ON MORE THAN 24

404
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
HOURS THE MAYHEM ERUPTED AND

405
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
FOR MORE THAN 24 HOURS,

406
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
THEY'RE UNABLE TO TOUCH THEIR

407
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
CHILDREN.
>> AND MAKE FUNERAL

408
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
ARRANGEMENTS.

409
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
AND THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE A

410
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
FIRST RATE MEDICAL SYSTEM IN

411
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
CONNECTICUT THEY KNOW THEY'VE

412
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
GOT TO GET THE BODIES TO THE

413
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
PARENTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

414
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
AND THAT'S WHY THEY'VE WORKED

415
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
ALL NIGHT AND MANY OF THE

416
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
BODIES, IF NOT ALL, SOME.

417
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
TRANSFERRED AT MIDNIGHT WHEN

418
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
NOBODY WAS AROUND TO TAKE

419
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
PICTURES AND ALL AND WENT TO

420
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
FARMINGTON AND THEY'RE WORKING

421
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
24 HOURS STILL TO COMPLETE

422
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO DO WITH

423
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
EACH BODY AND THEN RELEASE THE

424
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
BODIES TO THE FAMILY FOR THE

425
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS WHICH I

426
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
ASSUME THEY'LL START TOMORROW.

427
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
>> AS YOU CAN SEE ON YOUR

428
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
SCREEN THERE, WE ARE SEEING

429
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
SOME MOVEMENT AT THE SITE OF

430
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
THE NEWS CONFERENCE, AND THIS

431
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
NEWS CONFERENCE WAS SCHEDULED

432
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
FOR EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS

433
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
MORNING, IT'S NOW 10:13

434
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
EASTERN TIME, SO, MORE THAN

435
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
2 1/2 HOURS LATE.

436
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME

437
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
MOVEMENT AND SO PERHAPS WE'LL

438
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
GET SOME ANSWERS TO SOME OF

439
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
THESE QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE

440
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
BEEN LOOKING FOR.

441
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
DR. BADEN, THEY ALSO PUT OUT A

442
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
CALL FOR EXTRA HELP AND THE

443
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
CORONER'S OFFICE WAS

444
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
OVERWHELMED.
DOES THERE HAVE TO BE AN

445
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
AUTOPSY FOR EVERY SINGLE

446
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
CHILD?

447
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
>> THAT, THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

448
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
WILL HAVE TO DECIDE.

449
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
IF THERE IS A BULLET IN THE

450
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
BODY THEY HAVE TO DO AN

451
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
INTERNAL EXAMINATION TO REMOVE

452
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
THE BULLET.

453
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
ALL BULLETS HAVE TO BE

454
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
RECOVERED AND THEN THEY WOULD

455
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
GET MATCHED UP TO WHATEVER

456
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
WEAPONS ARE AVAILABLE.

457
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
IF THERE'S A BULLET FROM A

458
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
WEAPON THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE,

459
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
THAT MEANS THERE'S ANOTHER

460
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
SHOOTER.

461
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
EVEN AS REMOTE THAT MIGHT BE,

462
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
THAT'S ONE THING THAT THE

463
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
AUTOPSY WILL DO.

464
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
BUT THE CAUSE OF DEATH IS NOT

465
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
AN ISSUE.

466
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
THE AUTOPSY WILL SHOW HOW

467
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
CLOSE THE WEAPON WAS AT THE

468
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
TIME OF DISCHARGE, WHETHER IT

469
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
WAS DISTANT OR RIGHT UP CLOSE,

470
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
AND THE AUTOPSY ON THE

471
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
PERPETRATOR WILL TELL A LOT,

472
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
ON ADAM, WERE THERE ANY DRUGS

473
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
IN HIS BODY, HAD HE BEEN

474
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
GETTING PSYCHO THERAPEUTIC

475
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
DRUGS.

476
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
AND THERE'S SOME STUDIES THAT

477
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
SHOW SOME CAN MAKE AN AMERICAN

478
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
MORE APREGGRESSIVE.

479
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
>> AND WHAT DOES HIS BRAIN

480
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
LOOK LOOK.

481
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS

482
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
RAISED OF AUTISM AND

483
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
ASPERGER'S, NOTHING TO DO

484
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
WITH--

485
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
>> AND THE NEWS CONFERENCE NOW

486
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
STARTING, LET'S LISTEN TO THE

487
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000

AS YOU KNOW, THE VICTIMS HAVE

499
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
OF DOING SOME OF THEIR WORK

504
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000

I HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I JUST SIMPLY WANT YOU TO

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
THAT IS NOT COMPLETED.

555
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
THAT PROBABLY WILL NOT BE

556
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
COMPLETED FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
DAY AND A HALF TO TWO DAYS AND

558
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'M PUTTING A TIME LIMIT ON

559
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
IT, IT COULD TAKE LONGER.

560
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
AS I EXPLAINED TO YOU IN

561
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
PREVIOUS PRESS CONFERENCES,

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE NEED

563
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
TO DO TO LITERALLY PEEL BACK

564
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000

CREVICE OF THAT FACILITY AND

567
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE, OR

568
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
EXCLUDE, I SHOULD SAY, THE

569
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING.

570
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING

571
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
ALSO PART OF THE CRIME SCENE

572
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
EVERY SINGLE VEHICLE IN THAT

573
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
LOT.

574
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
SO, IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG,

575
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
PAINSTAKING PROCESS, WE

576
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
ACTUALLY HAVE THREE TEAMS NOW,

577
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
THREE MAJOR CRIME TEAMS IN THE

578
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
COMMUNITY, OUR LOCAL PARTNERS

579
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
ARE WORKING WITH US AND WE'RE

580
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
GOING TO MOVE THAT AND

581
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
EXPEDITE THAT ALONG AS QUICKLY

582
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
AS POSSIBLE.

583
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
WE HAD A MEETING THIS MORNING,

584
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
AND THAT WAS THE DELAY WITH

585
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

586
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
SCHOOLS, AND SHE WILL BE

587
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
HOPEFULLY IN NOT TOO DISTANT

588
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
FUTURE UP HERE TO TALK BRIEFLY

589
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000

SHE HAS ENCOUNTERED.

591
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
THE MINUTE, THE MEDICAL

603
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS, I'LL TAKE

604
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
A FEW, BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

605
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS CARDS

606
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
WE'RE HOLDING CLOSE TO OUR

607
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
CHEST IN THIS INVESTIGATION

608
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
UNTIL, SO NOTHING IS TAKEN OUT

609
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
OF CONTEXT AND CONTINUITY OF

610
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDE.

611
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
YES, SIR.

612
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
>> IT'S REPORTED THERE ARE

613
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
OTHER GUNS OTHER THAN WHAT WAS

614
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
USED FOUND IN THE SCHOOL.

615
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
ARE THOSE REPORTS ACCURATE?

616
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
>> NO, THAT'S NOT ACCURATE.

617
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
THE WEAPONRY THAT WAS

618
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
RECOVERED BY OUR INVESTIGATORS

619
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
IN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE

620
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
DECEASED AND AGAIN, WE'RE

621
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
INVESTIGATING THE HISTORY OF

622
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
EACH AND EVERY WEAPON.

623
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
AND WE WILL KNOW EVERY SINGLE

624
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
THING ABOUT THOSE WEAPONS.

625
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I KNOW FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS,

626
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
LEGALLY REGISTERED WHO ARE THE

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
OWNERS AND SO ON, SO FORTH.

628
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
THAT'S DONE BY THE

629
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
INVESTIGATOR ASSIGNED TO THAT

630
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
TASK.

631
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
(INAUDIBLE).

632
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
>> WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW, WAIT

633
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
FOR THE MEDICAL EXAMINER TO

634
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
COME IN AND PROVIDE THE

635
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000

637
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000

640
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
MOTIVE FOR THIS.
>> THAT'S CERTAINLY IS A VERY

641
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
GOOD QUESTION.

642
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
THE ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU ON

643
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
THAT IS THAT OUR INVESTIGATORS

644
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
AT THE CRIME SCENE, THE

645
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
SCHOOL, AND SECONDARILY AT THE

646
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
SECONDARY CRIME SCENE THAT WE

647
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
DISCUSSED WHERE THE LOCATED

648
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
DECEASED DID PRODUCE A VERY

649
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
GOOD EVIDENCE IN ITS

650
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
INVESTIGATION AND OUR

651
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
INVESTIGATORS WILL BE ABLE TO

652
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
USE AND HOPEFULLY PAINTING THE

653
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
COMPLETE PICTURE AS TO HOW ANDM

654
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
OCCURRED.
>> AND WOULD YOU

655
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
CHARACTERIZE--
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO NAME THE

656

EVIDENCE OR TALK ABOUT THE

657
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
EVIDENCE, IT'S SIMPLY STATED

658
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
AND PART AND PARCEL OF THE

659
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
INVESTIGATION AND I DON'T WANT

660
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
TO TAKE IT OUT OF THE CONTEXT

661
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
OF WHAT'S BEING DONE.

662
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000

663
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
ENTRANCE OF THE SCHOOL.

664

>> WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE

665
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
POINT OF ENTRY, IT WAS--

666
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I CAN TELL YOU IT WAS BELIEVED

667
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
HE WAS NOT VOLUNTARILY LET

668
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
INTO THE SCHOOL AT ALL, THAT

669
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
HE FORCED HIS WAY INTO THE

670
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
SCHOOL, BUT THAT'S AS FAR AS

671
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
WE CAN GO ON THAT.

672
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
>> AND BROKEN WINDOWS IN THE

673
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000

>> ARE THERE WHAT?

675
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
>> BROKEN WINDOWS AND QUITE

676
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
FRANKLY, IF YOU TAKE IT OUT OF

677
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
CONTEXT, IT SOUNDS SUSPICIOUS,

678
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
BUT AS THE RESCUE CREWS ARRIVE

679
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000

FOX.
AND WE WANT TO REVIEW A FEW

835
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
THINGS WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE

836
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
LIEUTENANT MOMENTS AGO.

837
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
ONE THING WE LEARNED THIS

838
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
MORNING OR HEARD ABOUT THIS

839
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
MORNING WAS A CORRECTION TO

840
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
WHAT WAS FIRST REPORTED ABOUT

841
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
HOW THIS SHOOTER ENTERED THE

842
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
SCHOOL.

843
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
INITIAL REPORTS POINTED TO THE

844
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
FACT THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

845
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
BUZZED IN BY THE FRONT OFFICE.

846
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
LIEUTENANT IS TELLING US HOW

847
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
WHEN HE ENTERED THE SCHOOL,

848
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
THAT WAS NOT A VOLUNTARY

849
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
ENTRY.

850
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW HE

851
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
FORCED HIS WAY INTO THE

852
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
SCHOOL, BUT THAT'S GIVING US A

853
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
LITTLE BIT MORE AFTER PICTURE

854
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
OF THE CRIME THAT TOOK PLACE

855
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
AND ALSO WE REFERRED TO YOU IN

856
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
THE PAST THAT SOME CHILDREN

857
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
SAW SHATTERED GLASS AS THEY

858
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
WERE ON THEIR WAY OUT OF THE

859
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
SCHOOL.

860
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
AND INITIALLY, AGAIN, TRYING

861
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
TO PIECE TOGETHER WHAT

862
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
HAPPENED, SOME POINT TODAY

863
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
MAYBE THE FACT THAT THAT WAS

864
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
BULLETS SHATTERED THE WINDOWS

865
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
IN THE SCHOOL.

866
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
THE LIEUTENANT ALSO TELLING US

867
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
THAT A RESCUE TEAM THAT SHOWED

868
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
UP ON SCENE TRIED TO GET IN

869
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
THE SCHOOL AND BEST WAY

870
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
POSSIBLE AND THAT MAY HAVE

871
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF

872
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
THE SHATTERED GLASS.

873
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
AND ALSO LIVE ON OUR AIR, YOU

874
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
SAW ON FOX NEWS, A HELICOPTER

875
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
SHOT AROUND THE SCHOOL

876
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
YESTERDAY AND IT LOOKED LIKE

877
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
INVESTIGATORS WERE HEADED INTO

878
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
THE WOODS BEHIND THE SCHOOL.

879
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
MUCH LIKE THE WOODS THAT YOU

880
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
SEE BEHIND ME RIGHT NOW.

881
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
THE SCHOOL ACTUALLY IN THIS

882
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
DIRECTION BEHIND ME.

883
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
NOW WE'RE LEARNING THAT

884
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
INVESTIGATORS WENT TO AROUND

885
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
THE SCHOOL AND TALKED TO

886
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
PEOPLE AND HEARD FROM THE

887
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
LIEUTENANT EVEN IF HE WAS

888
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
CHOPPING WOOD, HE WAS GOING TO

889
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
TALK TO YOU.
AND FINALLY, A LOT HAS BEEN

890
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
SAID ABOUT THE WEAPONS THIS

891
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
20-YEAR-OLD HAD AND THE

892
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
LIEUTENANT MAKING CLEAR

893
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
THEY'RE LOOK INTO THE EACH OF

894
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
EACH AND EVERY WEAPON.

895
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
NO WORD WHERE THE WEAPONS CAME

896
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
FROM AND HOW THIS MINOR WAS

897
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
ABLE TO GET HIS HANDS ON THEM.

898
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
>> YES, APPARENTLY HE ALSO

899
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
SAID, JENNA, AS YOU HEARD,

900
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
THAT THEY'VE DEVELOPED VERY

901
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
GOOD INFORMATION AS TO THE

902
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
CAUSE OF ALL OF THIS SHOOTING.

903
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
HE DIDN'T SAY SPECIFICALLY THE

904
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
MOTIVE.

905
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
HE DIDN'T USE THAT WORD, BUT

906
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
HE DID SAY THAT THEY HAVE THAT

907
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
INFORMATION AND THAT'S GOING

908
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
TO BE--
>> YOU WONDER, JON, YOU

909
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
WONDER, JON, IF YOU CAN EVER

910
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000

00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
KNOW THE LIEUTENANT WILL HE AS

914
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
WELL, BUT CAN YOU EVER REALLY

915
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

916
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
>> THAT'S THE OPEN QUESTION,

917
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
CERTAINLY, RIGHT NOW IS A TIME

918
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
FOR GRIEVING.

919
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
11 YEARS AGO THE NATION WAS

920
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
COMFORTED AT ONE OF THE WORST

921
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
HE IS OUR GUEST WITH US NOW

929
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
HERE IN THE STUDIO.

930
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE

931
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
NATION AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

932
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
THE HELP AND ASSISTANCE AND

936
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
THE SENSE OF LOVE THAT THERE

937
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
IS FOR THEM ALL OVER THE

938
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
COUNTRY AND WE SAW THE

939
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
PRESIDENT GIVING THAT TO THEM.

940
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I THINK THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS

941
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY THAT

942
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR THEM

943
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
TO KNOW NOW THEY'RE NOT ALONE

944
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
AND MANY PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY

945
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS AND

946
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
THEY'RE THERE FOR THEM, TRYING

947
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
TO HELP THEM THROUGH AND NOT

948
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
TO TRY TO ACCOMPLISH TOO MUCH

949
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
IN THE FIRST DAY OR TWO.
ON THE POLICE SIDE OF IT, IT

950
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
SEEMS THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING

951
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
THEY CAN DO AND HANDLED VERY

952
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
PROFESSIONALLY.

953
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT

954
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
EACH FAMILY WILL BE MOURN

955
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
DIFFERENTLY AND GIVEN THE TIME

956
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
TO DO IT.
>> ON THE CRIME SIDE, THE

957
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
CRIME IS OVER.

958
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
WE'VE HEARD SOMETHING ABOABOUT

959
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
POSSIBLE MOTIVE AND THE POLICE

960
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
THINK THEY MAY KNOW WHAT LED

961
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
THIS YOUNG MAN TO SNAP.

962
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
TODAY IS THE TIME FOR COMFORT

963
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
AND HEALING AND WORRY ABOUT

964
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
THE OTHERS DN ADDS.
>> THE REST OF IT WE'RE GOING

965
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
TO BE GUESSING AT, HAVING

966
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
INVESTIGATED CRIMES NOW FOR 43

967
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
YEARS, I CAN TELL YOU THE--

968
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
>> A FORMER FEDERAL

969
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
PROSECUTOR.
>> THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR

970
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
DAYS, HALF THE INFORMATION IS

971
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
WRONG, SO YOU CAN SEE

972
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
YESTERDAY RIGHT THERE, THE

973
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
FIRST REPORT WE HAD THE WRONG

WE HAD THE WRONG BROTHER.

975
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
AND THEN HE WAS BUZZED INTO

976
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
THE SCHOOL.

977
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
WELL, HE SHOT HIS WAY INTO THE

978
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
SCHOOL AND YOU CAN HAVE A LOT

979
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
EXPLANATI

982
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
EXPLANATION.
WHAT THERE WON'T BE AN

983
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
UNDERSTANDING OF IT.

984
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
