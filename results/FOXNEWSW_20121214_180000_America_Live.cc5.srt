00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000

ACROSS THE FACE OF THAT ONE

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
LITTLE GIRL IN THE BLUE SHIRT.

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
THE MOTHER OF THE CHILD CALLED

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
JENNA: CAN YOU TELL US WHAT

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
HAPPENED INSIDE THE SCHOOL WERE

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
YOUR DAUGHTER WAS?

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
>> SHE WAS IN A SMALL CLASS, A

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
READING GROUP.
THEY STARTED HEARING BANGS AND

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
HER TEACHER, WHICH I AM SO

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
GRATEFUL FOR, THERE WAS JUST A
SMALL GROUP.

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
THEY RUSHED THE KIDS INTO THE

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
BATHROOM.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
THEY LOCKED THE DOOR.

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
THEY JUST TOLD THE CHILDREN THAT

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
IT WAS HAMMERING, AND THEY TRIED

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
TO KEEP THEM CALM.

55
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
THE NEXT THING THAT I KNOW,

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD TO GET A

57
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
COMPLETE STORY, THE NEXT THING I

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
KNOW IS THAT THE POLICE CAME AND

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
THEY WERE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR

60
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
TO BE LET OUT OF THE CLASSROOM.

61
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
WHEN THEY WERE, THEY STOP

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
LAUGHING BLOOD.

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
ONE CHILD WAS COVERED IN BLOOD.

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I UNDERSTAND THAT CHILD IS SAFE

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
AND WAS NOT HURT.

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY ELSE.

67
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
MEGYN: THERE IS A LOT OF

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000

LEARNED MORE INFORMATION.

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I WOULD LIKE TO TELL THE VIEWERS

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
FIRST NEWS CONFERENCE ON THIS

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
TRAGEDY IN CONNECTICUT.

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
THAT WILL HAPPEN ANY MOMENT NOW.

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
IT HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR

78
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
1:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME.
IT HAS BEEN PUSHED BACK SHORTLY

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
AS THEY GET THE OFFICIALS IN

80
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
PLACE.

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
THIS EVEN NEWS ORGANIZATIONS

82
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
WORKING TO GET THE MICROPHONES
SET UP.

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
WE ARE TOLD IT WILL HAPPEN
MOMENTARILY.

84
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
GOING LIVE TO TRACE GALLAGHER AT

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
THE NEWS DESK.

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
REPORTER: WE WANTED TO PLAY THIS

87
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
THING CAREFULLY.

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
WE HAVE BEEN GETTING THE NUMBERS

89
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
ALL MORNING LONG.
POLICE WERE HOLDING THIS VERY

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
CLOSE TO THE VEST.

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
WE HAVE NOW CONFIRMED WITH THE

92
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT THE

93
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
NUMBERS ARE HORRIFYING.

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
TWENTY-SEVEN DEAD, INCLUDING 18

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
CHILDREN.
EIGHT ADULTS, AND THE GUNMEN.

96
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
IT ALL BEGINS TO MAKE SENSE.

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
BECAUSE EVEN IN THE EARLY GOING,

98
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
THE MAYOR AND THE POLICE

99
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
OFFICERS WERE SAYING THAT THIS

100
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
COULD BE FROM THE EARLY

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
ASSESSMENTS, ONE OF THE WORST

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
SHOOTINGS IN CONNECTICUT
HISTORY.

103
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
NOW WE KNOW IF THE NUMBERS HOLD
UP, THIS WOULD BE THE WORST

104
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
SHOOTING IN CONNECTICUT HISTORY.

105
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
THE GUNMAN, APPARENTLY, WAS IN

106
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
FULL CAMOUFLAGE.
HE WAS CARRYING TWO DIFFERENT

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
GUNS.

108
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
WE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE MORNING

109
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
WITH SOME OF THE WITNESSES HEARD

110
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
UP TO 100 SHOTS BEING FIRED.

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
NOW YOU HAVE THESE NUMBERS.

112
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
EARLIER THERE WAS A REPORT, AND

113
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
THIS APPARENTLY HAPPENED IN THE

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASS.

115
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
THE KINDERGARTEN CLASS WAS SO

116
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
FAR UNACCOUNTED FOR.

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
WE SAW PICTURES OF STUDENTS

118
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
BEING CARRIED AND SHEPHERDED OUT
OF THE SCHOOL TOWARD THE FIRE

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
STATION.
SOME OF THE AUTHORITIES AND

120
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
TEACHERS TELLING THE STUDENTS TO

121
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
PUT THEIR HEAD DOWN AND WENT TO

122
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
THE FIRE STATION AND DO NOT STOP

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
RUNNING UNTIL YOU GET THERE.

124
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
WE HEARD EARLY ON THAT THIS MAY
HAVE BEEN ISOLATED TO JUST BE

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
OFFICE.

126
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
THE GUNMAN MAY HAVE GONE IN THE

127
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
SCHOOL, WENT TO THE OFFICE, AND

128
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
OPENED FIRE ON A PRINCIPLE.

129
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
WE KNOW THAT THE VICE PRINCIPAL
WAS INJURED AND WE KNOW THAT

130
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
EIGHT ADULTS WITH SOME OF THEM

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
CLEARLY WERE IN.

132
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
THEY WERE IN THE PRINCIPAL'S

133
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
OFFICE.
THE PRINCIPAL, VICE PRINCIPAL

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
AND OTHERS, MOSTLY FEMALE

135
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
MEMBERS OF THE STAFF.

136
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
WE DO NOT YET KNOW THE BREAKDOWN
OF THE KINDERGARTEN CLASS.

137
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
KEEP IN MIND, THE SCHOOL IS IN

138
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
FAIRFIELD COUNTY.
A VERY UPSCALE COMMUNITY.

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
ALL SCHOOLS IN FAIRFIELD COUNTY,

140
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I WOULD KNOW BECAUSE MY CHILDREN

141
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
WENT THERE AT ONE TIME, IT WOULD

142
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
BE LOCKED DOWN AT 9:30 A.M.

143
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
TO GET INTO THE SCHOOL, YOU HAVE

144
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
TO HAVE VISUAL IDENTIFICATION.

145
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THERE ARE CAMERAS OUT FRONT AS

146
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
WELL AS

147
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
BEFORE THEY BUZZY WHEN COMING UP
TO LET THEM KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

148
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
THE SHOOTING REPORTEDLY HAPPENED

149
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
10 MINUTES AFTER THE DOORS WERE

150
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
LOCKED.
IT IS UNCLEAR IF THE GUNMAN CAME

151
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
IN BEFORE OR AFTER THAT.

152
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
BUT DURING THE MORNING

153
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
AGAIN, UP TO 100 SHOTS.

157
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
NOW THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

158
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
TRYING TO NOTIFY FAMILIES.

159
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
POLICE HAVE NOT COME OUT AND
SAID A SINGLE PUBLIC WORD ABOUT

160
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
THE NUMBER.

161
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THIS IS ALL COMING FROM SOURCES.

162
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
OUR SOURCE HAPPENS TO BE THE

163
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000

KNOW YET WHERE THOSE CHILDREN

169
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
ARE LOCATED IN THE SCHOOL.

170
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
AS WE GET MORE BREAKING NEWS,

171
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000

172
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000

THIS TIME.

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
THE HORRIFYING REALITY AT THIS

181
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
HOUR REMINDS ME OF WHAT HAPPENED

182
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
IN NEW YORK CITY AFTER 9/11,

183
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
WHEN THEY LINED UP OUTSIDE OF

185
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
REPORTER: YOU COULD EVEN GO BACK

186
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
TO WHAT HAPPENED AT COLUMBINE.

187
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
OR PERHAPS AT GEORGIA TECH.

188
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
YOU CAN SEE AT ONE POINT IN

189
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
TIME, THEY WERE ALLUDING TO A

190
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
TRIAGE, WHICH IS A STANDING

191
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
OPERATING PROCEDURE AND THEY SET

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
UP A RED TARP AND A YELLOW TARP

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
AND OTHER TARPS AND THEY WILL

194
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
BRING THE PATIENTS OUT AND THEY

195
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
WILL ASSESS THEM AS THE NEED.

196
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
THE RED IS THE MOST SERIOUS.

197
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
THE YELLOW IS NOT SO SERIOUS,

198
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
AND THEN YOU MOVE ON DOWN THE

199
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
LINE.

200
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
WE LOOK AT THAT TREE ARE SET UP

201
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
AND THERE WASN'T A SINGLE

202
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
PATIENT OUT THERE.
AT FIRST, IT SEEMED TO BE A GOOD

203
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
SIGN.

204
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
NOW, AS YOU GO LATER ON AND YOU

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
SEE GOING BACK TO COLUMBINE AND

206
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
VIRGINIA TECH, BUT THAT

207
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
APPARENTLY WAS NOT A GOOD SIGN.

208
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
THE FATALITIES WERE APPARENTLY
IN THE OFFICE AND IN A CERTAIN

209
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
CLASSROOM, BUT WE THOUGH WE
DON'T KNOW WHICH CLASSROOM THEY

210
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
WERE IN.
YOU KIND OF TOUCHED ON HOW THE

211
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
WHOLE TOWN, ALL THE SCHOOLS ON

212
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
LOCKDOWN, THERE WAS A REPORT

213
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
EARLIER THAT POLICE HAD

214
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
SURROUNDED A PURPLE VAN THAT WAS

215
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
IN DANDER, WHICH IS JUST A FEW

216
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
MILES AWAY.

217
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
POLICE HAD ACTUALLY SURROUNDED

218
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
THAT BAN, MAYBE OUR PRECAUTION,

219
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE INVOLVED.

220
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
WE ARE STILL WAITING TO GET THAT

221
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
INFORMATION FROM THE AUTHORITIES

222
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
MEGYN: STANDBY, WE ARE GOING

223
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
LIVE TO RICK LEVENTHAL WHO IS

224
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
NEAR THE SCHOOL AT A PARK WHERE

225
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
THE POLICE WILL BE HOLDING A

226
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
PRESS CONFERENCE.

227
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
REPORTER: WE ARE AT A PARK THAT

228
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
IS VERY CLOSE TO SANDY HOOK

229
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
ELEMENTARY.

230
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
THE POLICE HAVE NOT ARRIVED YET

231
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
FOR THE NEWS CONFERENCE, BUT WE

232
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
HOPE TO HAVE A LOT MORE OF THESE

233
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
QUESTIONS ANSWERED WHEN THEY DO.

234
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I HAVE HEARD FROM A FEDERAL

235
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
SOURCE PERSONALLY THAT THE

236
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
NUMBER DEAD WITH 26 OR 27, AND

237
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
INCLUDED 18 CHILDREN, ALSO

238
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
INCLUDED THE PRINCIPAL OF THE

239
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
SCHOOL AND THE GUNMAN.

240
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
TWO GUNMEN WERE AT THE SCENE.

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
A GLOCK PISTOL AND A NONMETAL --

242
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
9-MILLIMETER GUN.
HE WAS DRESSED IN CAMOUFLAGE.

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
POLICE ARE SAYING THAT HE -- BUT

244
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
THERE ISN'T AN ACTIVE SEARCH FOR

245
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
ANY MORE SHOOTERS AT THIS TIME.

246
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
THERE ARE SECURITY PROCEDURES IN

247
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
PLACE FOR THE DOOR SHOULD HAVE

248
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
BEEN LOCKED.

249
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
ANYONE WHO WANTED TO ENTER THE

250
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
SCHOOL AFTER 9:30 P.M. WOULD'VE

251
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
HAD TO BE BUZZED IN AND WOULD'VE

252
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
HAD TO SIGN IN WHEN THEY GOT

253
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
INTO THE SCHOOL ITSELF.
SO WE DO NOT KNOW HOW HE GOT IN,

254
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
BUT WE ARE TOLD THAT THIS GUNMAN

255
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
MAY HAVE KILLED AS MANY AS 26

256
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
PEOPLE IN THE SCHOOL, INCLUDING

257
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
UP TO 18 CHILDREN.

258
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
MEGYN: WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE

259
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
CHILDREN?

260
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE

261
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
CHILDREN AT THIS HOUR?

262
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
>> WE WERE TOLD THAT SOME

263
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
PARENTS WERE REUNITED WITH THEIR

264
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
CHILDREN.

265
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
THE CHILDREN WILL BE --

266
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
MEGYN: STANDBY, WE HAVE A PARENT

267
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
ON CAMERA NOW.

268
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
>> IT STARTED WITH THE NEIGHBORS

269
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
AND SO IT IS -- [INAUDIBLE]

270
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
>> [INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

271
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
>> WHEN IT HAPPENED, YOU COULD

272
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
HEAR THE GUNSHOTS.

273
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
SO IT WAS VERY UPSETTING AND IT

274
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE WE

275
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
HAPPENING.
IT IS GOING TO MAKE IT MUCH

277
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
WORSE.

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
>> [INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

279
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
>> I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

280
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
OUTSIDE OF THAT.

281
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I DO NOT HAVE ANY INFORMATION
OTHER THAN WHAT PEOPLE ARE

282
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
SPECULATING.

283
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
MEGYN: THAT APPEARED TO BE ONE

284
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
OF THE PARENTS WHO HAVE OLDER

285
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL.

286
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
THE CHILDREN APPEARED TO HAVE

287
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
ESCAPED UNHARMED.

288
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I WOULD LIKE TO GET BACK TO RICK

289
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
LEVENTHAL NOW.

290
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
HEARING FROM ONE OF THE PARENTS,

291
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN?
WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE SCHOOL,

292
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THEY WERE TOLD NOT TO ARRIVE.

293
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
BUT MANY PEOPLE CAME.

294
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
WHERE ARE THEY?

295
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
>> THEY HAVE SET UP AN AREA OF

296
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
THE LOCAL FIREHOUSE.

297
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
AS WE UNDERSTAND, MANY WERE LED

298
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
OUT OF THE SCHOOL.

299
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
THE TEACHERS LOCKED THEIR DOORS

300
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
WHEN THEY HEARD THE GUNSHOTS

301
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
FIRED.

302
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
MINUTES AGO, WE COULD SEE A LOT
OF POLICE OFFICERS BLOCKING ALL

303
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
THE ROADS THAT LEAD WHERE THE

304
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
SCHOOL IS LOCATED.
THAT ENTIRE AREA HAS BEEN

305
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
LOCKED.

306
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
SO THE POLICE HAVE THE AREA ON

307
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
LOCKDOWN.
WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THE

308
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
SCHOOL ON LOCKDOWN.

309
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
WE KNOW THAT THEY DID A ROOM BY

310
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
ROOM, SEARCH.

311
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
THEY LOCATED THE GUNMAN AND THE

312
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
CHILDREN.
AND AS FAR AS WE KNOW, CHILDREN

313
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
HAVE NOW BEEN REUNITED WITH

314
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
THEIR FAMILIES.

315
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
MEGYN: IS THERE ANY INFORMATION

316
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
ON THIS MAN'S CONNECTION TO THE

317
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
SCHOOL?
THE SHOOTER.

318
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
WE HEARD THAT THIS MAY HAVE BEEN

319
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
THE FATHER OF A STUDENT.

320
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
HAVE WE HEARD ANYTHING FROM ONE

321
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
PERSON ABOUT THAT?

322
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
>> I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT FROM

323
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT YET.

324
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
WE DO HAVE ONE SOURCE SUGGESTING

325
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
THE SHOOTER MAY HAVE BEEN A

326
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
YOUNG MAN, HIS YOUNG AT 20 YEARS

327
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
OLD.
WE ALSO HAVE HEARD THAT HE MAY

328
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
LIVE IN NEW JERSEY AND THERE MAY

329
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
HAVE BEEN A SEPARATE SITUATION

330
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
THERE.
A CRIME SCENE WHERE THEY KICKED

331
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
DOWN THE DOOR OF THE PERSON'S

332
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
HOME.

333
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
WE ARE TRYING TO CONFIRM THAT AT
THIS HOUR.

334
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS TRUE AT

335
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
THIS HOUR SPUME WE ARE HEARING

336
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
THAT THERE ARE SWAT TEAMS AT

337
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
THIS PERSONS HOME, THE POSSIBLE

338
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
SHOOTER'S HOME.

339
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
WE CANNOT CONFIRM THAT YET THE

340
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
ONE I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU WHAT

341
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
THE STATUS IS AT THE SCHOOL AT

342
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
THIS HOUR.

343
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
THEY ARE NOT EXPECTING ANY MORE

344
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
VICTIMS TO BE BROUGHT TO THE
CONNECTICUT HOSPITAL IN DANBURY.

345
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
TWENTY-SIX DEAD CONFIRMED BY FOX
NEWS.

346
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
WE BELIEVE IT IS 26 PEOPLE PLUS

347
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
THE GUNMAN?

348
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
WE ARE GETTING DIFFERENT REPORTS

349
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
FOR THE QUESTION IS, DO WE

350
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
BELIEVE THAT THE VICTIMS ARE
STILL IN SCHOOL.

351
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
REPORTER: IF YOU HAVE THAT MANY

352
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
VICTIMS LOCATED IN THE SCHOOL,

353
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
IT IS GOING TO BE A VERY LONG

354
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
AND VERY DIFFICULT AND VERY

355
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
GRISLY CRIME SCENE IT HAS TO BE

356
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
PROCESSED BEFORE ANYBODY IS OUR
MOVE.

357
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
HAS TO BE CAREFULLY DOCUMENTED,

358
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
PHOTOGRAPHS HAVE TO BE TAKEN.

359
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
ALL VICTIMS HAVE TO BE SECURED.

360
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
THEN TRANSPORTED FROM THE SCENE

361
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
ONCE THE ENTIRE CRIME SCENE HAS

362
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
BEEN MAPPED OUT.
THAT COULD TAKE HOURS.

363
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
YOU CAN EXPECT A CRIME SEEN

364
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
AROUND THE SCHOOL FOR DAYS.
POLICE WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP

365
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
EVERYONE OUT AS THEY PROCESS

366
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
THIS END ARE COVERED THE VICTIMS

367
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

368
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
IT WILL NOT BE OVER QUICKLY.

369
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
MEGYN: ONE CAN ONLY WONDER WHAT

370
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
THE PARENTS OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT

371
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
ACCOUNTED FOR ARE GOING THROUGH.

372
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
IS THERE A HOLDING PLACE FOR

373
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
THEM?

374
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
DO WE KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE

375
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
PRESENT ON THE SCENE AT ALL?

376
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT AS OF LATE.

377
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
REPORTER: OUR UNDERSTANDING IS

378
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
THAT EVERYONE WHO IS RUSHING

379
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
TOWARDS SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY
WAS BEING STOPPED AND REDIRECTED

380
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
TO THE FIREHOUSE, POSSIBLY TO
OTHER LOCATIONS AT THIS POINT.

381
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE

382
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
ARE NO PARENTS NOW HAVE THE

383
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
SCHOOL ITSELF.

384
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
EVERYONE HAS BEEN MOVED AWAY SO

385
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
THAT THE POLICE CAN DO THEIR JOB

386
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
NOW PROCESSING THE SCENE.

387
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
ANY PARENT WHO MAY HAVE CHILDREN

388
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
WHO WERE TAKEN FROM THE SCHOOL,

389
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
AT THIS POINT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

390
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
REUNITED WITH THOSE CHILDREN.

391
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
WE IMAGINE THIS WILL BE A

392
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
DIFFICULT DAY FOR EVERYONE

393
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
INVOLVED.
MEGYN: THERE WERE REPORTS

394
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
EARLIER THAT WERE TOUCHED ON OF

395
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
A POSSIBLE ACCOMPLICE.
AND THERE WAS SOME TAPE OF

396
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
POLICE.

397
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
THESE ARE THE LUCKY ONES, THE

398
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
PARENTS WHO GET TO TAKE THEIR

399
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
KIDS ON TODAY AND EXPLAIN TO

400
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
THEM WHY 18 OF THEIR CLASSMATES

401
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
ARE DEAD.

402
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
THERE WERE REPORTS OF A SECOND

403
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
PERSON, PERHAPS AN ACCOMPLICE.

404
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
WE DIDN'T HEAR MUCH MORE ABOUT

405
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
THAT.
NOW WE ARE GETTING MORE REPORTS

406
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
FROM OTHER SOURCES FOR THAT A

407
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
SECOND PERSON MAY BE IN CUSTODY.

408
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
HAVE THEY SAID WHETHER THEY

409
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
BELIEVE THAT PIECE OF THE

410
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
INVESTIGATION IS STILL OPEN?

411
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
>> WHAT WE HAD HEARD IS THAT
THERE WAS A POTENTIAL SECOND

412
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
SUSPECT.
OFTENTIMES AFTER THESE MAJOR

413
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
INCIDENTS, YOU HAVE A LOT OF

414
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
REPORTS THAT TURN OUT TO BE
FALSE.

415
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
A LOT OF TIMES THERE IS

416
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
CONFUSION IN THE MIDST OF THINGS

417
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
AND SOMEONE COULD BE RUNNING
FROM THE SCENE.

418
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
SOMEONE WHO MAY BE ESCAPING WITH

419
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
THEIR LIFE.
PEOPLE COULD THINK THAT THEY ARE

420
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
FLEEING THE SCENE BECAUSE THEY
ARE INVOLVED.

421
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
WE DON'T KNOW.
WE ARE WAITING FOR POLICE TO

422
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
BRIEF US AND WE HAVE BEEN TOLD

423
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
THERE'S NO ACTIVE INVESTIGATION

424
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
OR SEARCH FOR A SECOND SHOOTER.
THAT COULD MEAN THE THEY HAVE

425
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
PARTY CAPTURED A SECOND PERSON

426
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
IF SOMEONE WAS INVOLVED.

427
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
BUT WE HAVEN'T CONFIRMED THAT

428
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
YET.

429
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
MEGYN: WE WOULD LIKE TO TELL OUR

430
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
VIEWERS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS

431
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
NOTIFIED OF THE SHOOTING AT 1030
EASTERN TIME.

432
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
THE FBI AND LOCAL ENFORCEMENT ON

433
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
SCENE.

434
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
HE WAS ASKED FOR HIS REACTION
AND JAY CARNEY SAID THAT HE DOES

435
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
NOT WANT TO RELAY THAT UNTIL WE

436
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT HAS

437
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
HAPPENED.
HONESTLY, THE PRESIDENT HAS A

438
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
FATHER, SO HE FEELS ENORMOUS

439
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
SYMPATHY FOR THE FAMILY AND

440
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
WANTS TO DO EVERYTHING THAT HE

441
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
CAN TO SUPPORT STATE AND LOCAL

442
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT DURING THIS

443
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
TRAGIC EVENT.

444
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
JAY CARNEY WAS SPECIFICALLY

445
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
ASKED ABOUT WHETHER ASSAULT
WEAPONS BANS, WHETHER THAT

446
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
REMAINS THE COMMITMENT OF THE

447
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
PRESIDENT.
AND THE ANSWER WAS YES, IT DOES

448
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
REMAIN A COMMITMENT OF HIS.

449
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
BUT TODAY IS NOT A DAY TO ENGAGE

450
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
IN THIS KIND OF DEBATE.

451
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
REPORTER: WE JUST GOT WORD THAT

452
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
AN ENTIRE ENTIRE CLASSROOM OF

453
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
STUDENTS WAS NOT ACCOUNTED

454
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
FOR.

455
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
WE WERE TOLD THAT YOU ARE IN

456
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
CLASS -- WOULD SUGGEST THAT AN

457
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
ENTIRE KINDERGARTEN CLASS WAS

458
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
GUNNED DOWN IN THIS HORRIBLE

459
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
INCIDENT.
MEGYN: RICK LEVENTHAL, WE WILL

460
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
COME BACK TO YOU IN A MOMENT.

461
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
THE REPORTING SEEMS TO BE COMING

462
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
TOGETHER FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES.

463
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
TWENTY-SIX PEOPLE DEAD,

464
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
INCLUDING 18 CHILDREN.

465
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
AN ENTIRE KINDERGARTEN CLASS
UNACCOUNTED FOR.

466
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
A MAN WEARING FULL CAMOUFLAGE.

467
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
BLACK COMBAT GEAR, AND A

468
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
MILITARY STYLE VEST WENT INTO A

469
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM AND

470
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
OPENED FIRE WITH A CLOCK AND

471
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
SEMI AUTOMATIC 9-MILLIMETER

472
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
HANDGUN.
THEY SAID THAT 100 SHOTS WERE

473
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
FIRED.

474
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
WE HAVE NOT YET CONFIRMED ANY OF

475
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
THIS DIRECTLY WITH THE POLICE.

476
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
AN ENTIRE KINDERGARTEN CLASS IS

477
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
UNACCOUNTED FOR.

478
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
WE HAVE BILL DLEY NOW, WHAT ARE

479
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
YOUR THOUGHTS AND WE HAVE HEARD

480
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
SO FAR?
>> IT IS SO MUCH TO ABSORB ON SO

481
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS.

482
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT

483
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
STANDPOINT, WHAT THEY ARE DOING

484
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
RIGHT NOW AS THEY GO TO THROUGH

485
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
THIS, IT HAS TO BE TERRIFIC.

486
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
THESE PARENTS AND FAMILY ARE

487
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
RELATED AND TO GO TO ONE OF

488
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
THESE CRIME SCENES IS VERY

489
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
EMOTIONAL TO THEM AS THEY CARRY

490
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
OUT THEIR DUTIES.

491
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE HEARING
NOW IS THAT THERE IS POTENTIALLY

492
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
A SECOND PERSON.

493
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WAS A

494
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
PERSON THAT WAS CARRYING OUT
THIS ACT.

495
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
PROVIDING SOME KIND OF AIDING

496
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
AND ABETTING TO THIS INDIVIDUAL

497
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
WHO ENTERED THE SCHOOL.

498
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
WE ALWAYS ASK WHY.

499
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
THE BIG WHY QUESTION.

500
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'M SURE THEY'LL COME OUT IN

501
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
TIME.
RIGHT NOW, IT IS A CRIME SCENE

502
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
THAT HAS NOW BEEN PUT UNDER

503
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
CONTROL WITH THE DEVASTATION

504
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
THAT THIS PERSON HAS LEFT

505
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
BEHIND.
IT IS UP TO THE POLICE WE PUT

506
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
TOGETHER WHAT HAPPENED.

507
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
MAYBE EVEN OUT THE PERPETRATORS

508
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
HOME, WHICH SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD

509
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
EVEN BE NEW JERSEY.

510
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
WHAT WOULD THIS PERSON TO COMMIT

511
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
THIS ACT.

512
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
IT SOUNDS VERY PERSONAL AND VERY

513
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
SPECIFIC.

514
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
WHAT IS THE CONNECTION?

515
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
THERE ARE EVEN SUGGESTIONS THAT

516
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
MAY HAVE BEEN A FATHER OR A

517
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
RELATIVE.
THESE ARE ALL UNCONFIRMED.

518
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION

519
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
FLOATING AROUND AT THIS TIME.

520
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I THINK THE KEY THING HERE IS

521
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
THAT AS THEY GO THROUGH IT, THEY

522
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE

523
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
SECURED THE SITE.

524
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
THERE IS A SECOND PERSON, LIKE

525
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
WE SAW IN AURORA, COLORADO,

526
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
THEN THEY WILL DEAL WITH THAT

527
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
AND TAKE CARE OF.

528
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
MEGYN: ON THE PHONE WITH US NOW

529
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
WE HAVE A MOTHER OF A STUDENT AT

530
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

531
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH

532
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
US.
HOW OLD IS YOUR CHILD, AND IF HE

533
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
OR SHE WITH YOU.

534
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
>> MY DAUGHTER IS EIGHT YEARS

535
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
OLD.
SHE IS IN THE NEXT ROOM.

536
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
MEGYN: THANK GOD.
HOW DID YOU HEAR THE NEWS THIS

537
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
MORNING?

538
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
>> WE RECEIVED A TOWNWIDE CALL

539
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
FROM THE SCHOOL BOARD THAT THERE

540
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
HAD BEEN A SHOOTING IN THE

541
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
SCHOOLS WERE ON LOCKDOWN.
BUT THEY DID NOT SAY WHERE THE

542
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
SHOOTING WAS.

543
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD AN EVENT

544
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
LIKE THIS HAPPEN BEFORE.

545
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
THERE WAS A SHOOTING NEAR A

546
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
SCHOOL.
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

547
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
SCHOOL, THEN I RECEIVED A TEXT

548
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
ALERT ON MY PHONE THAT THERE WAS

549
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
A SHOOTING AT A SCHOOL ON

550
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
DICKINSON.

551
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
THAT IS WHERE MY DAUGHTER GOES

552
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
TO SCHOOL.
SO I TALKED TO THE PARENTS OF A

553
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
NEW AND THEY SAID THAT THERE

554
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
WERE CHILDREN BEING CARRIED OUT

555
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
ALL BLOODIED.

556
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE DEAD.

557
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I WENT INTO TOTAL PANIC.

558
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I WAS NUMB.

559
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I GRABBED MY DAUGHTER AND IT WAS

560
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
THE HAPPIEST MOMENT OF MY ENTIRE

561
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
LIFE.
THE HAPPIEST MOMENT.

562
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
BUT NOW BEING AWARE OF THE

563
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
CHILDREN THAT WERE KILLED, I AM

564
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
DEVASTATED.
MEGYN: DID YOU HAVE THE

565
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE OTHER

566
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
PARENTS AT THE FIREHOUSE?

567
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
>> I SAW OTHER PARENTS AND

568
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
TEACHERS AND I TALK TO THEM.

569
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I ASKED WHAT HAPPENED.

570
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
ANOTHER MOTHER THAT I KNEW SAID

571
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
SHE WAS IN THE SCHOOL, AND I

572
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
SAID ARE YOUR GIRLS ARE RIGHT.

573
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
SHE SAID THEY ARE FINE, BUT A

574
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
MASKED GUNMAN CAME IN AND

575
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
STARTED FIRING THAT THE

576
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
PRINCIPLE IS DEAD.

577
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I SAID THE PRINCIPLE IS DEAD?

578
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
THIS IS A VIVACIOUS WOMAN WHO

579
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
LOVED CHILDREN.

580
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
SHE WAS THE BEST PRINCIPLE,

581
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
OKAY?

582
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
IT IS JUST HARD TO BELIEVE.

583
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
YOU DO NOT EXPECT IT ANYWHERE.
IT'S TERRIBLE WHEN IT HAPPENS

584
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
ANYWHERE.

585
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
BUT UCR QUAINT LITTLE DOWNTOWN

586
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
HERE IN SANDY HOOK, IT IS JUST

587
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
CRAZY.
MEGYN: YOUR DAUGHTER IS EIGHT

588
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
YEARS OLD, HOW DO YOU HELP HER

589
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
UNDERSTAND?

590
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
>> SHE'S RIGHT HERE, SHE'S OKAY.

591
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS
HAPPENING UNTIL THEY GOT INTO

592
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
THE FIREHOUSE.

593
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
THEY REALIZE THAT WHAT WAS GOING

594
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
ON.
BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW MY

595
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
FRIENDS CHILDREN, IF THEY ARE

596
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
OKAY.
I TRY TO CALL SOME PEOPLE, THEY

597
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
ARE NOT ANSWERING THEIR PHONE.

598
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
MEGYN: WHAT IS THE AVERAGE CLASS

599
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
SIZE IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

600
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
>> PROBABLY 16 OR 17 STUDENTS.

601
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
A LOT OF STUDENTS, BUT A SMALL

602
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
COMMUNITY SCHOOL.

603
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
MEGYN: WHEN YOU HEAR

604
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
CHILDREN HAVE DIED IN A

605
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASS UNACCOUNTED

606
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
FOR -- DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO

607
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
YOU IN TERMS OF NUMBERS?

608
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.

609
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
MEGYN: PC THE CHILDREN AND THE

610
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
COMMUNITY REVOLVES AROUND THE

611
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
SCHOOLS.

612
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
ESPECIALLY A COUNTRY SCHOOL TO A

613
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
LARGE EXTENT.

614
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
HOW DO YOU FUNCTION?

615
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
HOW DO YOU GO ON FROM HERE?

616
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
>> PERSONALLY I FEEL GUILTY EVEN

617
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
TALKING TO YOU AND THE OTHER

618
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
NEWS OUTLETS BECAUSE I FEEL I

619
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
SHOULD RESPECT THE FAMILIES AND

620
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
THOSE WHO WERE KILLED.

621
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE FRIENDS

622
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
OF MINE WERE FRIENDS OF MY

623
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
DAUGHTERS.

624
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
-- I FEEL TERRIBLE.
ESPECIALLY AROUND CHRISTMAS

625
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
TIME.
MEGYN: THAT IS THE THING.

626
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF, TO AN

627
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
11 DATE FOR CHRISTMAS.

628
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
>> EXACTLY.
MEGYN: IT APPEARS THAT WE ARE

629
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
WAITING FOR OFFICIAL NEWS

630
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
CONFERENCE ABOUT 26 THE 26
PEOPLE THAT ARE DEAD, INCLUDING

631
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
18 CHILDREN.

632
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
HAD THERE BEEN ANY REPORTS OF

633
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
TROUBLE?

634
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
ANY PARENT MAKING TROUBLE?

635
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
ANYONE -- YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IN

636
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
A SMALL COMMUNITY PEOPLE ARE

637
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
CONCERNED ABOUT ONE PERSON.

638
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.

639
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
NOTHING.

640
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
IN THE SCHOOL YOU HAVE TO BUS

641
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
YOURSELF IN.

642
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
SECRETARIES CAN SEE YOU.

643
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
THEY BUZZ YOU IN.

644
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SOMEONE THEY

645
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
RECOGNIZE.

646
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
THEN PERHAPS -- I DON'T THINK

647
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
THEY WOULD LET SOMEONE IN WITH

648
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
MASS.
MEGYN: THAT IS A GOOD POINT.

649
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
BRENDA, I THINK YOU SO MUCH AND

650
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU THAT YOUR

651
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
LITTLE GIRL IS OKAY.

652
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
>>  THANK YOU AND GOODBYE THE

653
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
ONE BRINGING THE LATEST, WE ARE

654
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
GETTING REPORTS NOW.

655
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE MAY

656
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
BE DELAYED JUST A BIT.

657
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
OBVIOUSLY, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO

658
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
START AT 1:00 O'CLOCK.

659
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
WE ARE TOLD WITHIN THE HOUR.

660
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
WE BELIEVE IT IS SOMETHING SOON.

661
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
NOW WE CHECK IN WITH TRACE

662
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
GALLAGHER.

663
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
REPORTER: NBC NEWS HAS JUST

664
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
REPORTED THAT THERE WAS A SECOND

665
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
SHOOTER.
WE MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE

666
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
PURPLE VAN WAS SURROUNDED IN

667
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
DANBURY, JUST A FEW MILES AWAY

668
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
FROM SANDY HOOK.

669
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
NOW, WE ARE BEING TOLD THAT, IN

670
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
FACT, THERE IS A SECOND GUNMAN

671
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
IN CUSTODY.

672
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
KEEP IN MIND, THERE ARE ALSO

673
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
REPORTS OUT THERE THAT ONE OF

674
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
THE GUNMAN WALKED IN THERE THAT

675
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
HAVE MILITARY STYLE CAMOUFLAGE

676
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
AS WELL AS A FULL BODY ARMOR,

677
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
NOW THERE OUR REPORTS ABOUT FOR

678
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
WEAPONS BEING INVOLVED.

679
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
UNCLEAR IF THEY ARE TO WEAPONS

680
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
PER SHOOTER, EARLIER THERE WERE

681
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
REPORTS THAT SOMEONE HAD BEEN

682
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
PULLED OUT BY THE WOODS NEAR THE

683
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
SCHOOL.

684
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
THAT PERSON WAS WEARING

685
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
CAMOUFLAGE PANTS.
AS SOON AS THEY PULLED THE MAN

686
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
OUT OF THE WOODS, HE TURNED TO

687
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
THE POLICE, AND THE PARENTS THAT

688
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
WERE THERE SAID I DID NOT DO IT.

689
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
SO IT IS UNCLEAR IF THAT MAN MAY

690
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
BE CONNECTED.

691
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
WE ARE WORKING TO CONFIRM THIS.

692
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
NOW, THE REPORTS ARE FOR TWO

693
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
NETWORKS THAT THERE IS A SECOND

694
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
SHOOTER THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO

695
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
CUSTODY.

696
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
MEGYN: GOING BACK TO BILL DALEY,

697
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

698
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
WE ARE USING THE TERM SECOND

699
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
SHOOTER, THAT IS WHAT OTHER NEWS

700
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
OUTLETS ARE DESCRIBING HIM AS.

701
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
>> YOU KNOW, AS MUCH AS THERE IS

702
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
A DISTINCTION THERE, WE ARE

703
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO
APPEARS TO BE COMPLICIT.

704
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
THEY ARE SUGGESTING THAT HE WAS

705
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
INVOLVED AND HE WAS SPORTING

706
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
SOME FASHION, WE DON'T KNOW
WHETHER HE WAS IN THE BUILDING

707
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
OR NOT, THERE ARE SINGLE

708
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
INDIVIDUALS HAVE A CERTAIN EVENT

709
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
AND FOCUS OF WHAT THEY WANT TO

710
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
DO.
SOME KIND OF PERSONAL CONNECTION

711
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
THAT DRIVES THEM TO COMMIT THESE

712
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
ACTS, WHATEVER THAT CONNECTION

713
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
IS.

714
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
IN THIS CASE, I THINK THAT

715
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
SOMEBODY WHO WILLINGLY WENT

716
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
ALONG AND PROVIDED SUPPORT,

717
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
AIDED AND ABETTED, IF NOT

718
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
COMMITTED THE ACTS, IS EVEN MORE

719
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
HORRENDOUS.

720
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
MEGYN: I WOULD LIKE TO BRING YOU

721
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
THE LATEST, THIS IS FROM THE

722
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
ASSOCIATED PRESS, WHICH IS NOW

723
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
REPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT

724
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
OFFICIALS CLAIM THAT THIS IS A

725
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
20-YEAR-OLD MAN, IT WAS A

726
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
20-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO WAS THE

727
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
SHOOTER.
AGAIN, FROM THE ASSOCIATED

728
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000

WITH TIES TO CONNECTICUT SCHOOL.

729
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
OFFICIALS SAYING THAT THE GUN

730
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
USED IN THE ATTACKS IS A .223

731
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
CALIBER RIFLE.

732
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
AGAIN, NEW JERSEY STATE POLICE

733
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
ARE SEARCHING A PLACE THAT THEY

734
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
BELIEVE IS CONNECTED TO THE

735
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
SHOOTING.

736
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
IF IT IS THE HOME OF THE

737
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
SHOOTER, WE DO NOT KNOW.

738
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
BILL, DO YOU KNOW WHAT A .223

739
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
RIFLE IS?
>> IT JUST TELLS ME THAT THIS IS

740
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE COULD

741
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
HAVE ACQUIRED AN IN NUMBER OF
DIFFERENT STORES.

742
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
MEGYN: IS THIS A SHOT ON?

743
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
>> IS USED FOR HUNTING AND OTHER

744
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
PURPOSES.
IT DOESN'T SUGGEST IT IS WHAT WE

745
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
HEARD.
MEGYN: A SEMI AUTOMATIC

746
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
9-MILLIMETER GLOCK --

747
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
>> YES, IT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO

748
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
SHOOT ROUNDS VERY QUICKLY AND BE

749
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
RELOADED VERY QUICKLY.

750
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
MEGYN: WE HAVE HAD WITH THE

751
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
LATEST FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

752
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
REPORTER: AT KEARNEY, JAY CARNEY

753
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
JUST WRAPPED UP HIS SPEECH.

754
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
THE SHOOTING WAS TAKING PLACE
ABOUT 10:30 A.M. THIS MORNING.

755
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT JAY

756
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
CARNEY IS BEING CAREFUL.

757
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
HE IS NOT GETTING AHEAD OF THE

758
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
FACTS IN THIS CASE.

759
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS

760
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
WORKING WITH STATE AND LOCAL LAW

761
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO DEAL
WITH THE EARLY STAGES OF THIS

762
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
INVESTIGATION.
HE DID NOT WANT TO CONFIRM

763
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
ANYTHING IN TERMS OF NUMBERS OR

764
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
HOW THIS SHOOTING PLAYED OUT.

765
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
HE ALSO DID NOT WANT TO GET INTO

766
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
HOW THE PRESIDENT PERSONALLY

767
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
REACTED TO THIS.

768
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
CLEARLY, YOU KNOW THAT THE
PRESIDENT IS A FATHER HIMSELF

769
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
AND REALIZES THE DEPTH OF THE

770
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
TRAGEDY.

771
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
THE PRESIDENT IS VERY LIKELY TO

772
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
COME OUT AT SOME POINT THIS

773
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
AFTERNOON AND ADDRESSES TRAGEDY.

774
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
MEGYN: IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE

775
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
WILL HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT

776
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
HIMSELF DRUCKER TODAY?

777
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
>> YES, IT IS VERY LIKELY.

778
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I THINK HAVING BEEN TO THIS

779
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
BEFORE, WHERE THERE HAS BEEN

780
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS, PRESIDENT

781
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
BUSH, PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHERE

782
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
THEY WAIT A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO

783
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
FIGURE OUT THE FACTS AND FIGURE

784
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
OUT HOW DEEP THE TRAGEDY IS.

785
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
ONCE THEY HAVE A BETTER HANDLE

786
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
ON THAT, JAY CARNEY SAID IT WAS

787
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
LIKELY WE WOULD SEE THE
PRESIDENT COME OUT.

788
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
REPORTER: HERE IS JAY RNEY

789
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
MOMENTS AGO.

790
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
>> AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30 A.M.

791
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
THIS MORNING IN THE OVAL OFFICE,

792
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
THE PRESIDENT WAS NOTIFIED BY

793
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
HIS HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER

794
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
JOHN BRENNAN OF THE SHOOTING IN

795
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

796
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

797
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN RECEIVING

798
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
MORE UPDATES ABOUT THIS

799
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
INCIDENT.

800
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
AS THE DAY PERCEIVES, AS WE GET

801
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
MORE INFORMATION, WE WILL
CERTAINLY PROVIDE IT TO YOU.

802
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
MEGYN: WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU

803
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
AS NEWS WARRANTS.

804
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
FOX NEWS HAS CONFIRMED THAT THE

805
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
SHOOTER IS A 20-YEAR-OLD MAN.
A 20-YEAR-OLD MAN WE DO NOT KNOW

806
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
WHETHER HE HAD A CHILD AND

807
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
THAT'S COOL.
WE WERE TOLD IT WAS CATERED FOR.

808
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
KINDERGARTEN USUALLY AROUND FIVE

809
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
YEARS OLD.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE

810
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
COULDN'T BE THE FATHER OF A

811
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
STUDENT THERE.
IT DOES SEEM A LITTLE YOUNG, BUT

812
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH RIGHT NOW.

813
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
WE ARE BEING TOLD THE PRESS

814
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
CONFERENCE IS EXPECTED WITHIN

815
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
THE NEXT 40 MINUTES AND WE WILL

816
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
GET THE FIRST BRIEFING WE HAVE

817
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
HAD FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY

818
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

819
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
THE LEAST BETTER THAN NOTHING.

820
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
NOW WE HAVE DR. KEITH ABLOW, HE

821
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
JOINS ME VIA SKYPE.

822
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
WE REALLY NEED TO HEAR FROM HIM

823
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
TODAY.

824
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
EVERYONE OUT THERE IS FEELING
DISCONCERTED AND SAT AND STARED.

825
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
WONDERING IF THIS IS THE SOCIETY

826
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
THAT WE LIVE IN, FEARING FOR THE

827
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
PARENTS OF LITTLE CHILDREN.

828
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
CAN YOU HELP PUT IT INTO ANY

829
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
SORT OF PERSPECTIVE FOR US?

830
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
>> AS TO THE FEAR AND THE SHOCK,

831
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I UNDERSTAND.

832
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
THE RED LINE, BEYOND WHICH EVEN

833
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
THE BRAVEST WERE UNHINGED AMONG

834
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
US, THIS, KINDERGARTNERS, A

835
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
CLASSROOM PERHAPS OF THEM, THEY

836
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR.

837
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
PERHAPS GONE.

838
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
THIS KIND OF SHOCK RESONATES

839
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
WITH PEOPLE BECAUSE IT SEEMS

840
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
LIKE THE UNTHINKABLE KEEPS ON

841
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
MOVING INTO THE SPHERE OF OUR

842
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
REALITY.

843
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I THINK PEOPLE HAVE TO REACH OUT
TO THEIR KIDS.

844
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
THEY HAVE TO TELL THEM THAT IN

845
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
TERMS OF THE PROBABILITY OF IT

846
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
HAPPENING TO THEM, IT IS RARE.

847
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
ALSO, THEY SHOULD BE TOLD THAT

848
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
THESE THINGS DON'T COME OUT AS

849
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
BOGEYMAN.

850
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
THESE ARE SICK AND DEPRAVED

851
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
PEOPLE.
BUT THERE ARE WAYS THAT THEY CAN

852
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
BE IDENTIFIED SOONER AND WE WILL

853
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
WORK TO FIND THE WAYS AND WE

854
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
SHOULD WORK TO REBUILD OUR
MENTAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

855
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
IN THE END, THERE WILL BE THINGS

856
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
THAT THIS PERSON SAID THAT FOLKS

857
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
AND THERE WILL BE THINGS THAT

858
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
PEOPLE SHAKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND

859
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
SAY, HOW DID THEY NOT ACT ON

860
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
THAT?

861
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
WE ARE REALLY NOT PREPARED TO
ACT ON THAT.

862
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
THE SYSTEM IN THE MENTAL HEALTH

863
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
CARE ARENA IS SO FULL OF HOLES.

864
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
SO FRAGMENTED AND FRAGILE.

865
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
SO UNDERFUNDED.

866
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
SO I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A

867
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
WAKE-UP CALL TO REBUILD THAT.

868
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
AND THEN WE SHOULD LET CHILDREN

869
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
HELP OTHER KIDS.

870
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
WE SHOULD GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO

871
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
DO WITH THEIR GRIEF AND FEAR TO

872
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
REACH OUT TO THESE OTHER

873
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
FAMILIES.

874
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
THESE OTHER FAMILIES AND KIDS,

875
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
AND DO SOMETHING TO TRY TO

876
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
REASSURE THEM AND SHOW THEM THAT

877
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
THEY CARE.

878
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
MEGYN: YES, TRYING TO EMPOWER

879
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
THEM IN SOME WAY AREA TO TALK

880
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
ABOUT THE RED LINES.

881
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
IT IS WELL PUT.

882
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THERE IS

883
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
DEPRAVITY AND EVIL IN THE

884
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
SOCIETY, YOU'D LIKE TO BELIEVE

885
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
THAT THERE ARE LINES THAT JUST

886
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
DON'T GET CROSS.

887
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
IS THERE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT?

888
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
A SOCIOPATH HAS NO EMPATHY.

889
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
THERE IS NO FEELING AT ALL.

890
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
THE REAL QUESTION IS WHY HAVE

891
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
THERE NOT BEEN MORE THINGS LIKE

892
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
THIS IN THE PAST, AND WHAT IS

893
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
MAKING THEM SEEM TO COME OUT NOW

894
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
>> WELL, YOU AND I HAVE SPOKEN

895
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
ABOUT THIS BEFORE BOTH ON AND

896
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
OFF THE AIR.

897
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
JUST AS A CULTURE AND SOCIETY,

898
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
IS BEING DIMINISHED BY THINGS

899
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
LIKE REALITY TV AND FACEBOOK.

900
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
TAKING PEOPLE TO A FICTIONAL

901
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
ROME.

902
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I GUESS YOU COULD ADD COMPUTER

903
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
GAMES TO THAT.

904
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
NOW PEOPLE FEEL LESS FOR ONE

905
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
ANOTHER.

906
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
THEY CAN THINK OF THEM ALMOST AS

907
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
THIRD PARTIES OR ENTERTAINMENT

908
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
FIGURES WERE ANIMATED CREATURES.

909
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
FOR THE PEOPLE AMONG US WHO ARE

910
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
VULNERABLE TO ACTS OF VIOLENCE,

911
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
THOSE WHO ARE VIOLENTLY ILL, IF

912
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
YOU WILL, THAT MEANS THAT THEY

913
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
CAN CONSIDER OTHERS EVEN LESS

914
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
THAN EVER BEFORE.

915
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
SO IN GENERAL, OUR CAPACITY TO
RESONATE WITH EACH OTHER

916
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
STEALING IS BEING REDUCED, AS I

917
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
BELIEVE IT IS.

918
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
THE OUTLIERS ARE THAT MUCH LESS

919
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
ABLE TO FEEL ANYTHING.

920
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
THAT RED LINE WILL KEEP

921
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
SHIFTING.

922
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
SADLY, PRESIDENTS IS A TERRIBLE

923
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
THING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

924
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
INCLINED TOWARDS VIOLENCE.

925
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
WHAT IT DOES IS MOVE THE BAR.

926
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
ONCE YOU HAVE HAD ONE SHOOTING

927
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
IN A KINDERGARTEN, AND I HATE TO

928
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
EVEN SAY IT, AND YET AS A

929
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
SCIENTIST I KNOW IT, THERE COULD

930
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
BE OTHERS.
MEGYN: PEOPLE HAVE TO REMEMBER

931
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
WHAT HE SAID AT THE TOP.

932
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
STATISTICALLY THE ODDS OF

933
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENING TO

934
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
A CHILD OR YOUR FAMILY ARE VERY

935
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
RARE.

936
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
YOU THINK OF THE NUMBER OF

937
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
STUDENTS TO GO TO SCHOOL

938
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
EVERYDAY AND HAVE FOR DECADES IN
THIS COUNTRY, AND THEN A TRAGEDY

939
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
LIKE THIS HAS UNFOLDED.

940
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I DO WANT TO ASK YOU IF THERE IS

941
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
ANYWAY OF MOVING FORWARD FOR

942
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
THESE FAMILIES?
EVERYONE HERE IS FEELING FOR

943
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
THESE FAMILIES.

944
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
FAMILIES OF ALL 26 KIDS DEAD.

945
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
TWENTY-SEVEN TOTAL, IF YOU COUNT

946
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
THE GUNMAN.
EIGHTEEN OF WHOM ARE CHILDREN.

947
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I KNOW YOU SAY GIVE CHILDREN

948
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
HELP, AND OF THE MOTHERS AND

949
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
FATHERS AND SISTERS AND BROTHERS

950
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
OF THOSE CHILDREN.

951
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
HOW WOULD YOU WAKE UP TOMORROW?

952
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
HOW WOULD YOU HAVE YOUR

953
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
BREAKFAST AND FUNCTION IN THIS

954
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
WORLD?

955
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
>> WELL, THAT'S THE BEST THING,

956
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
BY THE WAY, YOU CAN TELL THEM.

957
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
THAT IS WHAT I WOULD TELL THEM

958
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
IN THIS OFFICE.

959
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I CANNOT FATHOM THE DEPTH OF
YOUR GRIEF.

960
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR YOUR

961
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
COURAGE.
I THINK THAT SOMEWHERE OUT OF

962
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
YOUR INCREDIBLE WOUND CAN COME

963
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
EXTRAORDINARY SENSITIVITY, SUCH
THAT YOU WOULD BE AN INCREDIBLE

964
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
GIFT TO OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT.

965
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
YET I HESITATE TO EVEN ASK THAT.

966
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
KNOWING NOW HOW MUCH THEY ARE

967
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
SUFFERING, AND I KNOW THAT IT'S

968
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
POSSIBLE.

969
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
BUT I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW
EVERYTHING THAT YOU ARE FEELING,

970
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
AND I INVITE YOU TO TELL ME.

971
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
PLEASE TELL ME, BECAUSE SILENCE

972
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
IS THE ENEMY OF HEALING.

973
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
MEGYN: YOU KNOW, SADLY WE HAVE

974
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
17 OTHER FAMILIES OF CHILDREN

975
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
THAT NEED TO BE COMFORTED.

976
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
NOT TO DIMINISH THE REPORTS OF

977
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
THE DECEASED ADULTS.

978
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
WE HEARD ONE MOTHER'S TESTIMONY

979
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
ABOUT A YOUNG VIBRANT WOMAN.

980
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
SO OFTENTIMES THE ADULTS AND

981
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
VICTIMS GET OVERLOOKED.

982
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
EACH LOSS IS PROFOUND.

983
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
THE ODDS ARE THOSE DEAD ADULTS

984
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
HAVE FAMILIES AS WELL.

985
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
PLEASE DON'T GO AWAY, DOCTOR, WE

986
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
NEED YOU.

987
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION

988
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
THAT WILL BE COMING OUT AS WELL.

989
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
WE STILL HAVE THE LEEWAY HERE

990
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
AND I WOULD LIKE TO GET LIVE TO

991
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
TRACE GALLAGHER AS WELL.

992
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
HE HAS A NEW NEWS DEVELOPMENT.

993
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
A HOME THAT IS BEING SEARCHED

994
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
NEAR THE SHOOTING SCENE.

995
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
REPORTER:

996
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
>> WE DO KNOW, IN FACT, THEY

997
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
HAVE CONFIRMED THAT A SECOND

998
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
PERSON IS BEING QUESTIONED.

999
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
WE DO NOT YET KNOW IF THAT

1000
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
PERSON HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO

1001
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
CUSTODY OR ARRESTED.

1002
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
THAT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN

1003
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
QUESTIONED.
THERE ARE REPORTS THAT IT WAS,

1004
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
IN FACT, THE MAN, WHO WE SAID

1005
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
EARLIER WAS BROUGHT OUT OF THE

1006
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
WOODED AREA BY THE SCHOOL AND

1007
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
THEN TURNED TO A PARENT AND, I

1008
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
DID NOT DO IT.

1009
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
THAT IS A PERSON WHO IS BEING

1010
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
QUESTIONED.
NO WORD IF HE IS A SUSPECT OR A

1011
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
PERSON OF INTEREST.

1012
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
ON TOP OF THAT, AS HE SAID,

1013
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
THERE IS NO HOME REPORTEDLY

1014
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
BEING SEARCHED IN NEWTOWN.

1015
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
THAT HOME BEING SEARCHED,
AUTHORITIES SAY IS CONNECTED TO

1016
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
THIS SHOOTING.

1017
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
AGAIN, WE TALKED ABOUT A PURPLE

1018
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
VAN BEING SURROUNDED EARLIER BY

1019
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
AUTHORITIES.

1020
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
WE HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING ELSE

1021
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
ABOUT THAT.
WE ARE GETTING MORE INFORMATION

1022
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
ABOUT THE CHAIN OF EVENTS.

1023
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
APPARENTLY WHAT HAPPENED IS THE

1024
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
SHOOTER WENT INTO THE
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE FIRST.

1025
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
WHEN THE SHOOTING HAPPENED, THE

1026
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE

1027
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
UNDERWAY, AND APPARENTLY THE
REST OF THE SCHOOL COULD HEAR

1028
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
THE VIOLENCE IN THE SHOOTING

1029
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
OVER THE SCHOOL INTERCOM.

1030
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
AS YOU SAID AS FAR AS CLASS

1031
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000

CLASSES AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

1034
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
SCHOOL.
BOTH OF THOSE CLASSES HAVE 17

1035
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
STUDENTS EACH IN THERE.

1036
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN HAVE BEEN

1037
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
KILLED.

1038
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
THE NUMBERS APPARENTLY ARE VERY

1039
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
MUCH IN SYNC, AND AN ENTIRE

1040
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASS REMAINS
UNACCOUNTED FOR.

1041
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000

GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY --

1047
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
CLEARLY IT IS TERRORISM OF SOME

1048
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
KIND.

1049
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
IT WAS NOT TERRORISM BY SOME TO

1050
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
HOTTEST GROUP.

1051
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000

THE POLICE WOULD NOT GET INTO

00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
CONFIRMATION FROM THOSE WHO ARE

1278
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
ON THE SCENE.

1279
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY

1280
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
DON'T WANT TO GIVE TOO MANY

1281
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
DETAILS AT THIS TIME.

1282
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I'M SURE THERE ARE A LOT OF

1283
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
FAMILIES GOING THROUGH A LOT

1284
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
RIGHT NOW AND TRYING TO FIGURE

1285
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
OUT WHETHER THEIR CHILD IS AMONG

1286
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
THE DEAD.

1287
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
BILL DALEY IS BACK WITH ME.

1288
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
THE FBI IS NOW ASSISTING THE
LOCAL ON ENFORCEMENT WITH THIS

1289
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.

1290
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
WHAT DID YOU PICK UP ON A?

1291
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
>> AS MUCH AS WE'D ALL LIKE TO

1292
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
GET MORE INFORMATION WITH

1293
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
DETAILS, I THINK THE WAY THEY

1294
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
APPROACH THIS IS NOT TO BE TOO

1295
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
MUCH AHEAD OF THE CURVE.

1296
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
TO NOTIFY THE NEXT OF KIN,

1297
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING

1298
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
BEFORE THEY SAY ANYTHING.

1299
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
FROM OUR STANDPOINT, WE ARE

1300
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
WONDERING WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON.

1301
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
IT IS QUITE INSPIRING THAT

1302
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
WITHIN A FEW HOURS, BUT THEY

1303
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
MOVE VERY QUICKLY ON A NUMBER OF

1304
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
DIFFERENT FRONTS.

1305
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
THEY'RE PROBABLY GETTING

1306
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
SUBPOENAS.
THE FBI IS INSISTING THAT LOCAL

1307
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT GOES ACROSS

1308
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
STATE LINES.

1309
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
IN AN EFFORT TO GET MORE

1310
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS

1311
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
INDIVIDUAL, OR ANOTHER

1312
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY ARE

1313
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
QUESTIONING.

1314
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
THE LIEUTENANT WHO WAS SPEAKING,

1315
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
IT MAY NOT MEAN THAT IT IS

1316
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW, A FACT --

1317
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
BUT HE DID NOT SAY THAT THEY

1318
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
CONFRONTED THE GUNMAN WHEN GOING

1319
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
INTO SCHOOL.

1320
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
SO SUGGESTING THAT THE GUNMAN

1321
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
WAS ALREADY DECEASED WHEN HE

1322
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
WENT INTO THE SCHOOL.

1323
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
AS HE WENT THROUGH HIS

1324
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
WALK-THROUGH OF WHAT THEY DID

1325
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
ROOM BY ROOM IN GATHERING THE

1326
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
CHILDREN AND STAFF AND TAKING

1327
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
THEM TO A SAFE AREA TO GET HIM

1328
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
OUT OF SCHOOL.

1329
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT TELLS

1330
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
US SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR GUNMAN

1331
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
HAVING TAKEN HIS OWN LIFE, BUT

1332
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
AS WE HEAR MORE ABOUT IT, THIS

1333
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
GUNMAN WENT INTO THE SCHOOL AND

1334
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
THERE WAS NO WAY TO STOP THEM.

1335
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
THEY HAD SOME CLUES.

1336
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
WE DON'T KNOW.

1337
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
BUT THE SHOOTER WAS IN THERE FOR

1338
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
A PERIOD OF TIME.
HE WAS WITH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS

1339
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
AND HE FIRED ON CHILDREN AND

1340
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
STAFF.

1341
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
MEGYN: I KNOW YOU ARE NOT A

1342
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
PSYCHIATRIST, BUT YOU HAVE BEEN
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT LONG TIME.

1343
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
HAVE YOU START TO UNDERSTAND HOW

1344
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
SOMEONE PUTS ON A MILITARY STYLE

1345
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
DRESS AND TAKES AT LEAST TWO

1346
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC HANDGUNS AND THOSE

1347
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
IN THEIR AND STARTS EXECUTING

1348
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
5-YEAR-OLD?

1349
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
>> YOU KNOW, IN LAW-ENFORCEMENT,

1350
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A STEP BACK.

1351
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
MEGYN: HOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT

1352
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
THOUGH?

1353
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
HAVE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

1354
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
HAVE YOU SEEN SOMETHING LIKE

1355
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
THAT?
IS IT JUST A SOCIOPATH?

1356
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
SOMEONE WHO CAN TAKE A LIFE --

1357
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
THAT IS WHO THEY ARE?

1358
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
IN YOUR HISTORY, HOW DO YOU

1359
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
UNDERSTAND THAT KIND OF EVIL?

1360
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
THE AMOUNT THE THING IS THAT YOU

1361
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
CAN'T.

1362
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
THERE ARE GOOD AND EVIL AND

1363
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN EVIL.

1364
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
THIS IS EVIL INCARNATE.

1365
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
THAT IS WHY THE GOOD PEOPLE COME

1366
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
TO PEOPLE WHO UP FOR WHAT IS

1367
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
RIGHT AND GOOD, SUPPORTING EACH

1368
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
OTHER, LOOKING AFTER EACH OTHER,

1369
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GOOD.

1370
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
EVIL IS ALWAYS THERE, AND THAT

1371
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
IS WHY WE HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT

1372
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
AND TEACHERS AND OTHER PEOPLE

1373
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
OUT THERE TRYING TO IDENTIFY

1374
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
PEOPLE BEFORE IT HURTS OUR

1375
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
CHILDREN.

1376
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
SOMETIMES THAT PEOPLE DOESN'T

1377
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
CATCH EVERYONE.
AND IT ISN'T AS SOLID AS WE

1378
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
WOULD LIKE TO BE.

1379
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
BUT WE KNOW THAT AS A RESULT OF

1380
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
THIS, PEOPLE NEED TO GO OFF AND

1381
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
DO GOOD THINGS.

1382
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
CONTINUING TO DO GOOD THINGS TO

1383
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
HELP EACH OTHER AND SOCIETY.
OTHERWISE PEOPLE WILL TAKE OVER.

1384
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
MEGYN: STAND BY FOR JUST A

1385
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
MOMENT.
JOINING US NOW IS A MOTHER WHO

1386
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
LOST HER CHILD.

1387
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
HER DAUGHTER, RACHEL, AND THE

1388
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
COLUMBINE SHOOTING.

1389
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
HER SON SURVIVE.

1390
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
BETH, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

1391
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
WE NEED YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS WELL

1392
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
TODAY.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AS WE

1393
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
WONDER WHAT THE PARENTS ARE

1394
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
GOING TO?

1395
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
>> WELL, MY FIRST REACTION IS

1396
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I'M EXTREMELY ANGRY.

1397
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
SO ANGRY.

1398
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
ANGRY THAT A MAN WOULD KILL

1399
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
BABIES.

1400
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
AND THESE ARE JUST LITTLE

1401
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
BABIES.

1402
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
AS FAR AS THE PERISCOPE, THEY

1403
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
ARE NOT GOING TO KNOW WHAT TO DO

1404
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
FOR A LONG TIME.

1405
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
WITH THE COLUMBINE SHOOTING, MY

1406
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
SON CRAIG SURVIVED BUT RACHEL

1407
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
DID NOT.

1408
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
IT WAS LIKE THERE WERE TIMES

1409
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
WHEN IT WAS REAL, AND OTHER

1410
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
TIMES IT WASN'T AND YOU KIND OF

1411
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
BLOCK OUT THE PAIN OF THAT.

1412
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
THE ANGUISH OF THAT.

1413
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
OR AT LEAST A YEAR OR POSSIBLY

1414
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
MORE, THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I

1415
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
WAS JUST GOING THROUGH THE

1416
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
MOTIONS OF HAVING LOST RACHEL.

1417
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
ALSO HAVING TO DEAL WITH A VERY

1418
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
EMOTIONALLY CRIPPLED YOUNG MAN,

1419
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
BECAUSE THIS GENTLEMAN WITNESS

1420
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
ALL OF THE VIOLENCE.

1421
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
AND THEN HIS SISTER WAS THE

1422
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
FIRST ONE THAT WAS KILLED.

1423
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
MY HEART RACES.

1424
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I JUST FEEL THAT THESE PARENTS

1425
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
-- THEY ARE GOING TO HURT SO BAD

1426
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
FOR SO LONG AND THERE'S THERE IS

1427
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO TO CONSOLE

1428
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
THEM.
LOSING A LITTLE CHILD LIKE THIS,

1429
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
IT MAKES ME VERY ANGRY.

1430
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
IT MAKES ME EXTREMELY ANGRY

1431
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
[CRYING]
MEGYN: IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOUR

1432
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
DAUGHTER AND SON WERE TOTALLY

1433
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
DEFENSELESS, THESE CHILDREN WERE
TOTALLY DEFENSELESS.

1434
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
THE MOST DEFENSELESS YOU COULD

1435
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
FIND ON THIS EARTH.

1436
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
WE ARE TOLD THAT THERE ARE 26

1437
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
INNOCENT VICTIMS IN ALL OF THIS.

1438
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,000
INCLUDING THE 18 CHILDREN.

1439
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
DID YOU FIND PEACE?

1440
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
>> WE DID, BUT IT CAME MUCH

1441
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
LATER.
BUT THERE DOES COME A DAY WHEN

1442
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
YOU DON'T CRY ALL DAY LONG.
THERE DOES COME A DAY WHEN THE

1443
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
SEVERE PAIN AND LOSS ISN'T

1444
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
SELF-EVIDENT.

1445
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
IT'S NOT SO PENETRATING.

1446
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
BUT IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET

1447
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
TO THAT POINT.

1448
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER HOPE THAT

1449
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
RIGHT NOW THESE PARENTS CAN'T

1450
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
IMAGINE HOPE.

1451
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
ALL THEY UNDERSTAND IS THAT,

1452
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
HAMAS.
EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT

1453
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
THINGS WILL GET BETTER.

1454
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
THE TRUTH IS THAT IS NOT REALITY

1455
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
TO THEM AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

1456
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
IT WON'T BE A REALITY FOR A VERY

1457
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
LONG TIME.

1458
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET PAST THE

1459
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
PAIN.
IT TOOK YEARS TO GET THERE,

1460
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
THERE CAME A DAY WHEN I LAUGHED

1461
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
AGAIN AND TALKING ABOUT RACHEL,

1462
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I COULD TALK ABOUT HER WITHOUT

1463
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
BURSTING INTO TEARS OR HAD A

1464
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
FLOOD OF EMOTIONS COME OUT.

1465
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
AND WE FOUND SOME GOOD THINGS TO

1466
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
DO.

1467
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
WE HAVE CHANNELED OUR ENERGY AND

1468
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
ANGER FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

1469
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
AND WE DID OUR BEST TO BE

1470
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
POSITIVE AND WE WERE ABLE TO

1471
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
TAKE RACIAL LEGACY AND USE IT

1472
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
FOR SOMETHING VERY POSITIVE.

1473
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
WHICH DID BRING FORTH HEALING.

1474
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
THESE CHILDREN ARE TOO LITTLE.

1475
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,000
TOO LITTLE TO HAVE ANYTHING LIKE

1476
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000

01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED AS BEING

1638
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
RELATED TO THIS SHOOTING.

1639
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
WE ARE HEARING OTHER SOURCES

1640
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
WHICH ARE THE NUMBERS WHICH ARE

1641
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
HORRIFIC.
27 DEAD, APPARENTLY 18 OF THEM

1642
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
CHILDREN.
AN ENTIRE KINDERGARTEN CLASS

1643
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
UNACCOUNTED FOR.

1644
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
THE CLASSES RUN IN SIZE FROM

1645
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
17-18 CHILDREN.

1646
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
A GUNMAN WALKED INTO THIS

1647
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND OPENED

1648
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
FIRE ON A KINDERGARTEN CLASS AND

1649
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
KILLED A NUMBER OF TEACHERS.

1650
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
WE ARE TOLD THE PRINCIPAL AS

1651
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
WELL BEFORE APPARENTLY KILLING

1652
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
HIMSELF.

1653
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
WE KNOW THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD

1654
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN AROUND SANDY

1655
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1656
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
POLICE ARE BLOCKING THE ROADS.

1657
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
THEY REUNITED PARENTS WITH THE

1658
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL AND THERE

1659
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
ARE 600 KIDS INSIDE THAT SCHOOL

1660
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
WHO ATTEND THAT SCHOOL ON A

1661
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
DAILY BASIS.

1662
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
NEIGHBORHOOD SHUT DOWN.
THE SCHOOL ON LOCKDOWN.

1663
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
THE ROOMS HAVE BEEN SEARCHED BUT

1664
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
THERE IS A MAJOR CRIME SCENE

1665
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
THAT MUST BE PROCESSED.

1666
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
BODIES IN THE SCHOOL.

1667
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
DIE GRAMS AND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT

1668
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
MUST BE TAKEN BEFORE THAT SCENE

1669
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
WILL BE CLEARED.

1670
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
WE ARE LOOK AT A LENGTHY

1671
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
PROCESS, PERHAPS DAYS.
WE ARE WAITING FOR FURTHER

1672
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
UPDATES FROM THE POLICE HERE AT

1673
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
THIS PARK CLOSE TO THE SCHOOL.

1674
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
BUT WE CAN'T GET ANYWHERE NEAR

1675
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
TO IT BRING YOU ANY MORE

1676
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S

1677
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
HAPPENING INSIDE THOSE WALLS.

1678
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
>> WE ARE GETTING MORE

1679
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
INFORMATION ON THE WIRES HERE IN

1680
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
STUDIO.
AND NONE OF IT IS GOOD.

1681
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
JOINING ME NOW MARK FUHRMAN, A

1682
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
FORMER L.A.P.D. POLICE DETECTIVE

1683
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

1684
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW THE POLICE

1685
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
ARE SUPPOSED TO PROCESS THIS

1686
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
CRIME SCENE.

1687
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
>> AS DIFFICULT AS IT IS, THESE

1688
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
MEN AND WOMEN HAVE TO PROCESS

1689
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
THE MOST HORRENDOUS SCENE WHERE

1690
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
CHILDREN ARE THE RECIPIENT OF

1691
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
ADULT VIOLENCE.

1692
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
IT'S TRAGIC BUT THEY HAVE TO GO

1693
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
THROUGH IT.

1694
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS SCENE,

1695
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
CERTAINLY NOW YOU HAVE THE

1696
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
HOMICIDE OF 26 PEOPLE AND THE

1697
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
SUICIDE OF ONE, YOU HAVE TO

1698
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
PROCESS THIS SCENE FOR THE

1699
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
WEAPONS FOR THE SUSPECT.

1700
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT CERTAINLY WE

1701
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
ARE TALKING ABOUT THE WEAPONS.

1702
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT CASINGS

1703
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
FROM THESE SEMI-AUTOMATIC

1704
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
WEAPONS ARE ON THE FLOOR, HOW

1705
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
MANY CALIBERS WE ARE DEALING

1706
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
WITH.
YOU HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE

1707
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
WEAPONS.

1708
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I HEARD YOU REPORT THERE WAS A

1709
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
223 SUPPOSEDLY USED.

1710
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
IF THAT IS THE CASE, THERE WOULD

1711
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
BE RIFLE CASINGS ON THE FLOOR.

1712
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
MEGYN: WHAT IS THAT?

1713
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
>> IT'S AN AR PLATFORM.

1714
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
IT'S A CALIBER OF A RIFLE ROUND

1715
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
IT'S MOST PREDOMINANTLY IN A

1716
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,000
TYPE OF MILITARY -- PARA

1717
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
MILITARY PLATFORM.

1718
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
MOST PEOPLE GENERICALLY CALL

1719
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
THEM ASSAULT WEAPONS.

1720
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
IT'S A SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

1721
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I'M NOT SURE THEY MAKE ANY

1722
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
PLATFORM OTHER THAN PISTOLS.

1723
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY DO.

1724
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
IF THERE ARE THREE OR FOUR

1725
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
WEAPONS ALL ACCOUNTED FOR, THEN

1726
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
YOU COULD ASSUME OR AT LEAST

1727
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
START TO SPECULATE THAT ONE

1728
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
PERSON HAD ALL FOUR WEAPONS.

1729
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
WERE THEY IN HIS POSSESSION.

1730
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
WERE THEY IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO

1731
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
HIS BODY?

1732
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
TWO SUSPECTS -- IF ONE SUSPECT

1733
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
IS GONE AND THEY DIDN'T FLEE ON

1734
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
FOOT, THERE WOULD BE A VEHICLE

1735
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
MISSING.

1736
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
THERE SHOULD BE A VEHICLE THAT

1737
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
THE SUSPECT TRANSPORTED HIMSELF

1738
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
TO THE LOCATION.

1739
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
IT SHOULD STILL BE THERE.

1740
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
THEY WILL ACCOUNT FOR THAT.

1741
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
BUT THE PROCESS OF THE SCENE IS

1742
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
A HOMICIDE AND WE DON'T KNOW AT

1743
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
A LATER TIME -- IS THERE A

1744
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT THIS ACT?

1745
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
WHAT IS THE MOTIVE OF THIS ACT?

1746
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
DOES IT PERTAIN TO, INVOLVE

1747
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
OTHER PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY

1748
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
SUPPLIED THIS MAN WITH ANYTHING

1749
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
AND THEY KNEW THIS ACT WAS

1750
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE PLACE?

1751
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
IN OTHER WORDS, A CONSPIRACY.

1752
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
SO THE INVESTIGATION AND THE

1753
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
PROCESSING OF THE SCENE HAS TO

1754
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
BE DONE CORRECTLY AND IT WILL

1755
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
TAKE 2-3 DAYS AND THERE WILL

1756
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
HAVE TO BE A TASK FORCE SET UP

1757
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T EXPECT ONE

1758
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
DETECTIVE OR ONE TEAM TO STAY UP

1759
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
FOR 2 OR 3 DAYS.

1760
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
THEY WILL GET RAGGED AND THEY

1761
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
WILL MAKE MISTAKES.

1762
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
SO THIS WILL TAKE SOME TIME.

1763
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
IT WILL BE EMOTIONALLY TAXING ON

1764
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
EVERYBODY THAT'S INSIDE THAT

1765
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
SCHOOL.

1766
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
MEGYN: I WANT YOU TO STAND BY

1767
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
FOR JUST A MINUTE.

1768
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I'M TOLD TRACE GALLAGHER HAS

1769
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
BREAKING NEWS AND IS FOLLOWING

1770
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
INFORMATION REGARDING THE HOME
THAT WAS SEARCHED.

1771
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
IS THAT THE CASE, TRACE?

1772
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
>> Reporter: WE TALKED ABOUT

1773
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
THIS HOME BEING SEARCHED.

1774
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT CONNECTION

1775
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
IT WAS TO THE SCHOOL SHOOTER.

1776
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
NOW ONE OF THE LOCALS IS

1777
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
REPORTING THAT THERE WAS A BODY

1778
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
THAT WAS FOUND INSIDE THAT HOME

1779
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
IN NEWTOWN AND THEY ARE

1780
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
INVESTIGATING WHETHER IT MIGHT

1781
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
BE -- AND AGAIN WE SAY MIGHT

1782
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
BE -- NONE OF THIS HAS BEEN

1783
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
CONFIRMED -- THE BODY OF THE

1784
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
MOTHER OF THE SHOOTER.

1785
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
WE SAID THERE WAS A SECOND

1786
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
PERSON OF INTEREST WHO WAS BEING

1787
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
QUESTIONED BY POLICE.

1788
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
WE HAVE NO WORD IF THAT PERSON

1789
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
HAS BEEN ARRESTED OR TAKEN INTO

1790
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
CUSTODY.
SIMPLY BEING QUESTIONED.

1791
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
THAT WOULD IF YOU ARE CONNECTING

1792
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
THE DOTS ELIMINATE THAT PERSON

1793
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
AS BEING CONNECTED TO THIS NEW

1794
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
TOWN, CONNECTICUT HOME.

1795
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
REPORTS ARE THAT A BODY WAS

1796
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
FOUND INSIDE THIS HOME AND IT

1797
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
MAY HAVE BEEN THE MOTHER OF THE

1798
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
SHOOTER.

1799
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
AGAIN WE ARE GOING BY LOCAL

1800
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
REPORTS.

1801
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

1802
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
VERY CLEAR.

1803
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
TOP ADD ONE MORE EXCLAMATION

1804
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
POINT.

1805
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
A CAR BEING USED?

1806
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
WE KNEW EARLIER A CAR WAS

1807
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
CORDONED OFF AT THE ENTRANCE TO

1808
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
THE SCHOOL.

1809
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
IT HAD BEEN TAPED OFF.

1810
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
UNCLEAR IF THAT WAS THE CAR OF

1811
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
THE SHOOTER, ABOUT IT WAS PARK

1812
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
THE RIGHT DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF

1813
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
THE EXIT AND ENTRANCE TO THIS

1814
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1815
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
MEGYN: KEEP WORK OUR SOURCES AND

1816
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
BRING US THE INFORMATION AS YOU

1817
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
GET IT.

1818
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
WE NOW CONFIRMED THE IT WAS A

1819
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
20-YEAR-OLD ARE GETTING INFORMA,

1820
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
THERE ARE REPORTS ABOUT THIS

1821
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
IDENTITY.

1822
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
WE ARE NOT GOING TO GO WITH THAT

1823
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
UNTIL WE KNOW FOR SURE THE

1824
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
IDENTITY OF THE SHOOTER.

1825
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU, MARK.

1826
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
WE CONFIRMED IT'S A 20-YEAR-OLD

1827
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
MAN.

1828
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
EARLIER THIS WEEK WE SAW A MASS

1829
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
SHOOTING -- AN ATTEMPTED MASS

1830
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
SHOOTING, TWO PEOPLE DEAD AT A

1831
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
MALL OUT IN THE PORTLAND, OREGON

1832
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
AREA.
THAT WAS A 22-YEAR-OLD SHOOTER.

1833
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1834
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
>> I'M CERTAINLY NOT EQUIPPED TO

1835
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
TELL YOU PSYCHOLOGICALLY WHAT'S

1836
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
GOING ON.

1837
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD MOST

1838
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
CRIMES ON THE STREET.

1839
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS YOU

1840
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
WILL BE ABLE TO GO BACKWARDS.

1841
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
WHEN TRACE GALLAGHER WAS

1842
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
REPORTING ABOUT FINDING A BODY

1843
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
AT THAT HOME, POSSIBLY THE

1844
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
MOTHER OF THE SHOOTER, THAT WAS

1845
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
NOT A SURPRISE TO ME.

1846
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I SUSPECTED THEY WOULD FIND A

1847
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
RELATIVE, A GIRLFRIEND OR WIFE

1848
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
AT THAT LOCATION.

1849
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
CERTAINLY THE FIRST THING THEY

1850
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
DO IS TRY TO SECURE THE

1851
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
SUSPECT'S LOCATIONS, DO SEARCH

1852
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
WARRANT AND TRY TO CIRCLE THE

1853
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
WAGONS AROUND ANY POSSIBILITY OF

1854
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
SOMETHING THAT WOULD CONTINUE OR

1855
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
TO COLLECT EVIDENCE.

1856
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE

1857
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
SHOOTINGS, YOU KIND OF WONDER

1858
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
WHAT IS THE CAUSE?

1859
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
AND I KNOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

1860
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
SAY GUNS.

1861
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
BUT THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE.

1862
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
IT'S THE PEOPLE -- WE WATCHED

1863
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
THIS NATION BE BROUGHT TO IT'S S

1864
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
ITS KNEES BY MEN WITH BOX

1865
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
CUTTERS.
THAT NOT THE ISSUE.

1866
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
IT'S THE PEOPLE.

1867
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
TO BE CANDID.

1868
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I CAN COUPLE WITH NOTHING SHORT

1869
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
OF MENTAL ILLNESS THAT WOULD

1870
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
LEAD SOMEBODY TO THINK THEY WERE

1871
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
GOING TO PROVE SOMETHING.

1872
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
OR ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING EXCEPT

1873
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
FOR IMMORTALITY IN THE MOST

1874
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,000
BLACK AND BIZARRE AND MACABRE

1875
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
WAY.

1876
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
MEGYN: THE EXTREME COWARDICE OF

1877
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
A MILITARY VEST AND COMBAT GEAR

1878
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
TO GO IN AND EXECUTE A COUPLE OF

1879
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
DOZEN 5-YEAR-OLDS.

1880
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
THERE IS NO ONE WHO CAN HELP US

1881
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
UNDERSTAND THAT.

1882
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
BUT JUST THE SHEER ILLNESS AND

1883
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
COWARDICE OF IT.

1884
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
>> ONE MORE THING, MEGYN.

1885
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
WHEN YOU HEAR THAT HE HAD

1886
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
ALREADY KILLED OR MOST PROBABLY

1887
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
KILLED HIS MOTHER AT A LOCATION

1888
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
THAT HE PROBABLY LEFT FROM THIS

1889
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
MORNING, HE KNEW THAT HE WAS

1890
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
NEVER COMING BACK.

1891
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
AN WHAT ELSE JUST --

1892
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
MEGYN: BEFORE YOU FINISH THAT

1893
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
THOUGHT WE ARE TOLD WE BELIEVE

1894
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
THIS VIDEO IS THE POLICE OUTSIDE

1895
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
OF THE HOME WHERE WE BELIEVE

1896
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
THIS WOMAN'S BODY WAS FOUND.

1897
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
INITIAL REPORTS ARE THAT IT MAY

1898
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
BE A WOMAN LINKED TO THE GUNMAN,

1899
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
POSSIBLY THE MOTHER.

1900
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
ALL UNCONFIRMED.

1901
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
GO AHEAD, MARK.

1902
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
>> YOU JUST LOOK AT THIS.

1903
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
HE WAS -- HE WAS TIDYING UP HIS

1904
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
MENTALLY DISTURBED LIFE.

1905
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
HE KILLED A PERSON AT THE

1906
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
RESIDENCE THAT HE WAS EITHER

1907
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
RELATED TO OR STAYED AT.

1908
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
HE WAS NEVER COMING BACK THERE.

1909
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
HE WAS NEVER LEAVING THIS CRIME

1910
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
SCENE.
WHETHER HE WAS SHOT BY THE

1911
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
POLICE OR HE TOTALLY AND

1912
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
ABSOLUTELY ALWAYS INTEBLEDDED TO

1913
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
TAKE HIS OWN LIFE.

1914
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
YOU ASK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON.

1915
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I SEE ONE THING WE HAVE PEOPLE

1916
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
THAT ARE GOING TO COMMIT SUICIDE

1917
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
THAT SOMEHOW WANT TO BE LESS

1918
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
ANONYMOUS IN THE REALM OF

1919
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
SUICIDE AND MORE FAMOUS IN THE

1920
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
AREA OF HOMICIDE.

1921
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

1922
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT.

1923
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
BUT IT IS THE FACT THAT THIS IS

1924
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
THE SOCIETY WE LIVE IN NOW.

1925
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
MEGYN: MARK, THANK YOU.

1926
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
DR. ABLOW WILL BE BACK WITH US

1927
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
IN JUST A BIT.
WE ARE GOING TO CHECK BACK IN

1928
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
WITH HIM.

1929
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
BUT I WANT TO GET TO AN EXPERT

1930
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
ON SCHOOL SECURITY.

1931
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
BOB, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

1932
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT WE HAVE

1933
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
SEEN.
>> HOW DO YOU PREPARE FOR

1934
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

1935
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
AAS MUCH AS WE ARE IN SCHOOLS

1936
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
AROUND THE WORLD, WE SET UP

1937
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
PROTOCOL.
YOU LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP

1938
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
BETWEEN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT

1939
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
AND THE SCHOOL.

1940
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
YOU LOOK AT THE CRIME STATISTICS

1941
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

1942
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
YOU LOOK AT YOUR PARENTS WHO

1943
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
HAVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES.

1944
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
THESE ARE PART OF A GOOD

1945
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,000
SCENARIO TO BUILD A PREVENTATIVE

1946
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
PROGRAM.
BUT WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE

1947
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
THIS, THIS IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

1948
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
TO PREVENT.

1949
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
MEGYN: THEY HAD SECURITY IN

1950
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
PLACE.
I KNOW YOU HAVE DONE SECURITY

1951
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
FOR CONNECTICUT SCHOOLS.

1952
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
THEY HAD A SECURITY SYSTEM WHERE

1953
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
YOU HAD TO BE BUZZED IN.

1954
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
THEY HAD TO SEE YOU ON THE

1955
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
CAMERA BEFORE YOU GET INTO THE

1956
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
SCHOOL.
WE ARE TOLD THE SHOOTER HAD

1957
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
QUOTE TIES TO THE SCHOOL.

1958
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUT

1959
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
SOMETHING FAILED.

1960
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
>> THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE A CLOSE

1961
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR

1962
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
PSYCHIATRIST AND LOCAL POLICE

1963
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
DEPARTMENT.
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KNOW IF

1964
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,000
THERE IS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

1965
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
SITUATION IN TOWN.

1966
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
THE SCHOOL AND THE POLICE HAVE

1967
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER IN ORDER

1968
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
TO RESPOND.

1969
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
IT IS SOMETHING THE POLICE ARE

1970
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
AWARE OF.

1971
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
WE DON'T KNOW HERE YET WHAT THE

1972
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
CASE IS.

1973
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
MEGYN: BUT THE ODDS OF THIS GUY

1974
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
HAVING BEHAVED COMPLETELY

1975
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
NORMALLY AND NOT HAVING HAD ANY

1976
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
RED FLAGS PRIOR TO THIS DAY --

1977
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
>> THEY ARE SLIM.

1978
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
THERE HAS GOT TO BE SOME ISSUES

1979
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
HERE.
THE POLICE ARE LOOKING THROUGH

1980
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
HIS FACEBOOK AND TELEPHONE

1981
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
CALLS.

1982
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
THEY ARE LOOK AT THE HARD DRIVE

1983
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
ON THE COMPUTER.

1984
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
THEY ARE CHECKING EVERYTHING OUT

1985
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
IN HIS PAST AND CURRENT PAST.

1986
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
ONE TO MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE IS

1987
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,000
INVOLVED, THAT THERE IS NO OTHER

1988
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
COCONSPIRATORS.
HOW DID HE GET TO THIS POINT,

1989
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

1990
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
MEGYN: WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO THE

1991
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
PARENTS WHO HAVE KIDS IN SCHOOL.

1992
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT -- THERE

1993
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
ARE AREAS IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE

1994
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
SCHOOLS ARE NEAR WAR ZONES AND

1995
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
IT'S A TRAGEDY AND A STORY IN

1996
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
ITSELF.

1997
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
BUT MOST PARENT SEND THEIR

1998
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
CHILDREN TO SCHOOL AND THEY

1999
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEIR SAFETY.

2000
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM NOW?

2001
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
>> I CAN TELL YOU AS A CO-CHAIR

2002
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
WITH THE TERRORISM TASK FORCE IN

2003
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
NEW YORK, BEING INVOLVED WITH

2004
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
DARE AMERICA WITH POLICE

2005
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
OFFICERS GOING INTO THE SCHOOLS

2006
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
ON A REGULAR BASIS IT'S A MATTER

2007
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
OF HAVING THAT RELATIONSHIP AS

2008
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
STRONG AS IT CAN BE IT'S MAKING

2009
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
SURE THE PARENTS, THE TEACHERS,

2010
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
THE SCHOOL BOARD, THE POLICE ARE

2011
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
ALL WORKING IN CONCERT WITH ONE

2012
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
ANOTHER.
YOU DO THE BEST NUK TERMS OF

2013
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
PREVENTING A SITUATION LIKE THIS

2014
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
FROM OCCURRING.

2015
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
MEGYN: MOST SCHOOLS ARE SAFE.

2016
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,000
>> SOME SCHOOLS HAVE METAL

2017
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
DETECTORS.

2018
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
THIS WAS A NICE LOVELY BEAUTIFUL

2019
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
TOWN WHERE PARENTS LET THEIR

2020
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
LITTLE CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL IN

2021
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE TO

2022
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
FEEL PERFECTLY SAFE.

2023
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
MEGYN: LIKE MOST TOWNS AND

2024
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
SCHOOLS IN AMERICA.

2025
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
MOST TOWNS AND SCHOOLS IN

2026
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
AMERICA CHOOSE TO LIVE AS A FREE

2027
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
SOCIETY AND WE WON'T HAVE METAL

2028
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
DETECTORS WHERE OUR 5-YEAR-OLDS

2029
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
GO IN TO LEARN THE MOST BASIC

2030
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
LESSONS.
SO THAT'S A DECISION WE MAKE.

2031
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME LINE

2032
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
OF SECURITY.

2033
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
HERE THE DAYS AND WEAKS AHEAD

2034
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
WILL TELL US WHAT THE FAILING

2035
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
WAS.
THAT'S NOT A JUDGMENTAL THING.

2036
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
IT'S A LET'S LEARN FROM IT.

2037
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
BUT IT APPEARS HE WAS BUDS IN

2038
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
WHEN HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN OR

2039
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
PIGGY BACKED ON SOMEBODY.

2040
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
SOMEHOW FOUND A WAY IN.

2041
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
DO SCHOOLS NEED TO TAKE THIS AS

2042
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT EVEN

2043
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
THE MOST BASIC SECURITY

2044
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
PROCEDURES THEY HAVE IN PLACE?

2045
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
>> YES.
ONE OF THE FAILURES WE HAVE IS

2046
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
WE TEND TO THINK BECAUSE WE ARE

2047
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
IN A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE

2048
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
CAN GET OUT OF THE CITY AND GO

2049
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
TO NEW JERSEY OR LONG ISLAND OR

2050
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
CONNECTICUT OR ANYWHERE ACROSS

2051
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
OUR COUNTRY WHERE WE ARE AWAY

2052
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
FROM THE BIG CITIES AND AWAY

2053
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
FROM THE CRIME POPULATION THAT

2054
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
WE HAVE A SENSE OF SECURITY.

2055
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
VERY OFTEN THOSE ARE THE AREAS

2056
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
WHERE YOU NEED MORE SECURITY

2057
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE

2058
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
POLICE OFFICER ON THE CORNER

2059
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
WITH A WEAPON TO BE ABLE TO

2060
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
SHOOT THIS GUY.

2061
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
NO ONE WAS AROUND WITH A WEAPON

2062
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
FAST ENOUGH TO KILL HIM.

2063
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
MEGYN: DO MOST SCHOOLS HAVE A

2064
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
SECURITY OFFICER.

2065
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
>> MOST SCHOOLS HAVE A SECURITY

2066
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
OFFICER FROM THE LOCAL DHOAPT IS

2067
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
ASSIGNED TO THE SCHOOL.

2068
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
BUT HE'S NOT IN THE SCHOOL ALL

2069
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
DAY.
MOST OF THESE SMALL TOWNS MAYBE

2070
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
HAVE 8, 10, 15 POLICE OFFICERS.

2071
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
THEY HARDLY HAVE ENOUGH PART

2072
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
TIME POLICE OFFICERS TO EVEN DO

2073
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
THE DARE PROGRAM TO TEACH KIDS

2074
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
ABOUT DRUGS AND VIOLENCE.

2075
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE A

2076
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
FULL-TIME POLICE OFFICER.

2077
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
THE KIDS SOMETIMES IN THE DARE

2078
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
PROGRAM WILL TELL THE DARE

2079
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
OFFICER THEIR FAR IT IS VIOLENT,

2080
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
THEIR MOTHER IS VIOLENT.

2081
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
THEY HAVE A BROTHER OR UNCLE WHO

2082
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
IS VIOLENT.

2083
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
YOU GET INFORMATION BY

2084
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
COMMUNICATING WITH THE KIDS.

2085
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
MEGYN: THIS IS LOOKING LIKE IT

2086
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
WASN'T THE FATHER OF A STUDENT.

2087
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
HE'S ONLY 20.

2088
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
WE DON'T KNOW.

2089
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
IF THIS IS SOME RANDOM SHOOTING.

2090
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
HE HAS SOME TIES TO THE

2091
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

2092
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
IF IT'S A RANDOM SHOOTING HOW DO

2093
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
YOU FORESEE THAT AND PLAN

2094
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
AGAINST IT?

2095
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
>> IT'S HARD.

2096
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
THAT'S WHY YOU DO THE BEST IN

2097
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
TERMS OF THE CCTV AND A SYSTEM

2098
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
TO LET PEOPLE INTO THE SCHOOL.

2099
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,000
YOU BUILD PERIMETERS OUTSIDE THE

2100
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
SCHOOL.
MEGYN: IT'S WHEN YOUR GUARD IS

2101
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
DOWN AT SOMETHING HAPPENS.

2102
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
>> IT MAY CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE

2103
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
GO FLY ON AN AIRPLANE.

2104
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
THIS MAY BE WHAT IT TOOK FOR

2105
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
SCHOOLS TO WAKE UP AND CHANGE

2106
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
THE WAY THEY CONDUCT SECURITY.

2107
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
YOU DON'T GET NEAR THAT SCHOOL

2108
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
WITHOUT GOING THROUGH PERIMETER

2109
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
SECURITY.
WITH A GAIT GOING UP -- IF HE'S

2110
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
DRESSED IN COMBAT GEAR AND

2111
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
WEARING A MILITARY-STYLE VEST

2112
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
AND HE HAS BETWEEN 2-4 WEAPONS.

2113
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
A .223 CALIBER RIFLE.

2114
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
NO ONE IS GOING TO BUZZ HIM IN

2115
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
IF THAT'S VISIBLE.

2116
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
THE POINT YOU MAKE ABOUT THE

2117
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
POLICE IS AN INTERESTING ONE.

2118
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I HAVE TWO KIDS.

2119
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
NOW I WANT TO SEE AN ARMED

2120
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
POLICE OFFICER IN THE SCHOOLS.

2121
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT THAT

2122
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
TRIER TO NOW.

2123
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
WHAT WOULD THAT TAKE TO HAVE AN

2124
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
ARMED POLICE OFFICER IN EVERY

2125
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
SCHOOL?
>> I THINK WE JUST SAW IT.

2126
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
EVERY TOWN WE DEAL WITH WITH THE

2127
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
DARE PROGRAM, IT HAS LOST ABOUT

2128
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
A THIRD OF ITS TEACHING

2129
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
CAPABILITY ACROSS THE COUNTRY

2130
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
BECAUSE OF BUDGET CUTS IN LOCAL

2131
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
MUNICIPALITIES.

2132
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
IT'S A REALITY WE LIVE WITH.

2133
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
BUDGETS ARE DOWN IN CITIES AND

2134
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
TOWNS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY AND

2135
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THE

2136
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
PROGRAMS.
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO AFFORD TO

2137
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
PUT A FULL-TIME POLICE OFFICER

2138
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
INTO THE SCHOOL?

2139
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
THEY WILL HAVE TO DO THE

2140
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
PREVENTATIVE PROGRAMS WE

2141
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
RECOMMEND FOR SCHOOLS IN TERMS

2142
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
OF PERIMETER SECURITY.

2143
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
CCTV.
ALL THAT WILL HAVE TO BE PUT

2144
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
INTO PLACE.

2145
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
IN ADDITION YOU MIGHT HAVE TO

2146
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
HAVE A SECURITY OFFICER THAT

2147
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,000
DOESN'T HAVE NECESSARILY NOT A

2148
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
POLICE OFFICER BUT AN ARMED

2149
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
SECURITY OFFICER.

2150
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
MEGYN: IT COULD BE SOMETHING

2151
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
PARENT PAY FOR.

2152
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
>> I THINK LIT CHANGE THE WAY WE

2153
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
LOOK AT THINGS.

2154
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
FOR SCHOOLS THIS WILL BE WHAT

2155
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
9/11 WAS FOR AIRPORTS.

2156
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
MEGYN: I WANT TO GET TO TRACE

2157
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
GALLAGHER WITH BREAKING NEWS.

2158
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
>> Reporter: WE JUST CONFIRMED

2159
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
THE SHOOTER IS IDENTIFIED.

2160
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,000
HE IS 20-YEAR-OLD RYAN LANZA.

2161
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

2162
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
WE HAVE SOME PICTURES AND

2163
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
IDENTIFICATIONS.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE

2164
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
RIGHT GUY BEFORE WE PUT HIS

2165
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
PICTURE UP ON THE AIR.

2166
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
HE'S NOW THE SHORT AND

2167
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO OTHER

2168
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
REPORTS HE LIVED IN NEWTOWN,

2169
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
CONNECTICUT IN FAIRFIELD COUNTY.

2170
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
BECAUSE THE OTHER REPORTS WERE

2171
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
POLICE WENT TO HIS HOME AND

2172
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
REPORTEDLY FOUND A BODYNSIDE

2173
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
THAT HOME THAT THEY ARE

2174
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
INVESTIGATING THE POSSIBILITY

2175
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
THE BODY MAY HAVE BEEN THE

2176
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
MOTHER OF 20-YEAR-OLD RYAN

2177
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
LANZA.

2178
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
WE DO KNOW THAT IN FACT YOU CAN

01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000

2180
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,000
PICTURE OF 20-YEAR-OLD RYAN

2181
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
LANZA.

2182
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
YOU SAID EARLIER HE HAD A

2183
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL.

2184
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
THE SCHOOL AT 9:30 GOES INTO

2185
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
LOCKDOWN.
BEFORE YOU CAN GET IN THE FRONT

2186
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
DOOR YOU HAVE TO BE BUDS IN.

2187
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
THEY CAN SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE

2188
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
THEN YOU GIVE THEM A REASON WHY

2189
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
YOU WANT TO COME IN.

2190
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
IF THIS GUY WAS BUDS IN, IT'S

2191
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
UNCLEAR.
WE ARE BEING TOLD RYAN LANZA IS

2192
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
24 YEARS OLD.

2193
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
THIS WOULD CHANGE THINGS.

2194
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
WE WERE FIGURING OUT HOW WOULD A

2195
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
20-YEAR-OLD HAVE A CONNECTION TO

2196
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
THE SCHOOL IF HE DIDN'T WORK AT

2197
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
THE SCHOOL.

2198
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
IF YOU ARE 20 YEARS OLD IT'S

2199
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
HIGHLY UNLIKELY YOU WOULD HAVE A

2200
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
STUDENT WHO GOES TO THE SCHOOL.

2201
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
IF HE IS 24 YEARS OLD, MAYBE

2202
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
THIS IS NOT SOMEONE WHO WORKED

2203
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
FOR OR WITH THE SCHOOL.

2204
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
MAYBE THIS WAS A PARENT OF A

2205
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
STUDENT AT THE SCHOOL.

2206
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
WE ARE TRYING TO WORK ALL THAT

2207
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
OUT.
HE WAS BUZZED IN THROUGH A NEW

2208
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
SECURITY SYSTEM WHICH APPARENTLY

2209
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
WAS JUST PUT IN PLACE A COUPLE

2210
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
WEEKS AGO BUT HAS BEEN IN PLACE

2211
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
IN MUCH OF FAIRFIELD COUNTY

2212
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
WHERE YOU CANNOT GET IN THE

2213
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,000
FRONT DOOR UNLESS YOU ARE GIVEN

2214
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
CLEARANCE TO GET IN THE FRONT

2215
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
DOOR.

2216
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
MEGYN: STAND BY WITH ME.

2217
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I WANT TO UPDATE OUR VIEWERS.

2218
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

2219
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT JUST

2220
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
AFTER 9:30 A.M. WE BELIEVE THIS

2221
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
MAN, 24-YEAR-OLD RYAN LANZA WENT

2222
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
INTO THE SCHOOL WEARING COMBAT

2223
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
GEAR, A FULL MILITARY-STYLE VEST

2224
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,000
AND HAD BETWEEN 2-4 WEAPONS

2225
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
INCLUDING A GLOCK AND A

2226
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
SEMI-AUTOMATIC.

2227
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
WE BELIEVE HE FOUND HIS WAY INTO

2228
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
ONE OF THE KINDERGARTEN

2229
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
CLASSROOMS.
WE ARE TOLD AN ENTIRE

2230
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASS REMAINS

2231
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
UNACCOUNTED FOR.

2232
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
WE ARE TOLD 27 PEOPLE ARE DEAD

2233
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
IF YOU INCLUDE THE GUNMAN.

2234
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
RYAN LANZA.

2235
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
OF THE 26 INNOCENT VICTIMS.

2236
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
18 ARE CHILDREN.

2237
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
THAT IS OUR INFORMATION AT THIS

2238
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
HOUR.
THERE HAD BEEN REPORTS THAT OVER

2239
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
100 SHOTS WERE FIRED.

2240
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM

2241
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
THAT.
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY SHOTS

2242
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
WERE FIRED.

2243
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
AND THE POLICE SAY THAT THE

2244
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
SHOOTER IS DEAD INSIDE THE

2245
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
CLASSROOM.
WE BELIEVE THAT THE BODIES OF

2246
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
THE VICTIMS REMAIN INSIDE THE

2247
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
SCHOOL AS WELL AS THE POLICE

2248
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
CONTINUE TO PROCESS THE CRIME

2249
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
SCENE AND WE ARE TRYING TO GET

2250
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
MORE INFORMATION NOW ON REPORTS

2251
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
OF A POSSIBLE SECOND SUSPECT.

2252
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
KEEP IN MIND SOMETIMES THESE

2253
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
THINGS COME DOWN AND THEY DON'T

2254
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
TURN OUT TO BE ANYTHING.

2255
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
BUT WE DID LEARN EARLIER THERE

2256
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
IS A HOUSE NEAR THE SCHOOL IN

2257
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
WHICH A BODY HAD BEEN FOUND AND

2258
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
THERE WERE EARLY REPORTS THIS

2259
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
PERSON MAY HAVE BEEN RELATED TO

2260
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
RYAN LAND TODAY, PERHAPS HIS

2261
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
MOTHER.

2262
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
BACK TO TRACE NOW WITH MORE.

2263
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
>> Reporter: YOU ARE TALKING

2264
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
ABOUT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT

2265
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
THIS SHORT.
WE JUST READ HIS FACEBOOK PAGE

2266
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
AND MATCHED THE PICTURE.

2267
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
HE IS 24 YEARS OLD.

2268
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
HE LIVES IN HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY.

2269
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
YOU HEARD RICK LEVENTHAL TALK

2270
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
ABOUT HOW POLICE WERE SEARCHING

2271
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
A HOME IN NEW JERSEY.

2272
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
HE'S FROM NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

2273
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
HIS MOM LIVED IN NEWTOWN,

2274
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
CONNECTICUT.
HE LIVES IN WHO BROKEN, NEW

2275
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
JERSEY.

2276
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
WAS HE A FORMER STUDENT?

2277
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
WHAT CAPACITY DOES HE HAVE A

2278
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
CONNECTION TO THIS ELEMENTARY

2279
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
SCHOOL AND WHY WAS HE BUZZED IN.

2280
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
THAT'S THE INFORMATION WE ARE

2281
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
GETTING.

2282
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
HE'S FROM NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT

2283
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
BUT HE LIVES CURRENTLY OR

2284
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
CURRENTLY LIVED IN WHO BROKEN,

2285
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
NEW JERSEY.

2286
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
AND THAT'S WHY AUTHORITIES ARE

2287
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
ALSO IN NEW JERSEY SEARCHING THE

2288
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
HOME THERE.

2289
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
SO THE PUZZLE IS GETTING A

2290
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
LITTLE BIT MORE PIECED TOGETHER.

2291
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
BUT AS YOU MENTION, OTHER

2292
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
POTENTIAL SUSPECT OR PERSON OF

2293
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
INTEREST POLICE ARE TALKING TO.

2294
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
WE HAVE GOTTEN VERY LITTLE MORE

2295
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT ROLE HE

2296
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE PLAYED IN

2297
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
ANY OF THIS.

2298
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
MEGYN: I WANT TO GO TO TONY

2299
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
PERKINS WHO WE HAPPEN TO BE

2300
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE WITH US

2301
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
TODAY.
HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE FAMILY

2302
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
RESEARCH COUNCIL.

2303
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
WHAT AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR FAITH

2304
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
AND WHAT A CHALLENGE TO IT FOR

2305
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
THOSE FAMILIES.

2306
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
>> AS A FATHER OF FIVE KIDS MY

2307
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
HEART IS BROKEN FOR THOSE

2308
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
FAMILIES.

2309
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
AS A FORMER POLICE OFFICER THAT

2310
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
HAS BEEN AT CRIME SCENES BEFORE

2311
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE STRESS

2312
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
THESE OFFICERS WILL HAVE IN

2313
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
PROCESSING THIS CRIME SCENE.

2314
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
YOU ARE RIGHT, IN TIMES LIKE

2315
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
THESE WE SEE COMMUNITIES ACROSS

2316
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
THE COUNTRY TURN TO FAITH.

2317
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
CHURCHES OPEN THEIR DOORS, THEY

2318
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
REACH SOUTH.

2319
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
IT'S PART OF THE GRIEVING

2320
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
PROCESS AS THIS CONTINUES TO

2321
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
UNFOLD.
MANY PEOPLE WILL BE TRYING TO

2322
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
MAKE SENSE OF THIS AND YOU

2323
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
CAN'T.
THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN LIFE

2324
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
YOU SIMPLY CANNOT MAKE SENSE OUT

2325
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
OF.
THIS ONE OF THOSE SENSELESS ACTS

2326
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
OF VIOLENCE.

2327
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
OUR STAFF IN WASHINGTON TODAY --

2328
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
WE ARE GATHERING EVEN IN THIS

2329
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
HOUR PRAYING FOR THESE FAMILIES.

2330
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
MOST OF US HAVE KIDS.

2331
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
AND EVERY AMERICAN IS TOUCHED BY

2332
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
A TRAGEDY LIKE THIS.

2333
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
MEGYN: THE FAMILY RESEARCH

2334
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
COUNCIL WAS TARGETED NOT TOO

2335
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
LONG AGO BY A MADMAN WHO SHOT

2336
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
THE GUARD.

2337
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
HE'S OKAY NOW.

2338
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
>> HE'S BACK TO WORK.

2339
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
MEGYN: YOU HAVE BENT VICTIM OF

2340
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
VIOLENCE.
DR. ABLOW WAS ON EARLIER TALKING

2341
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,000
ABOUT THE DEPRAVITY AND

2342
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
DISCONNECTION PEOPLE FEEL FROM

2343
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
SOCIETY.
BECAUSE WE HAVE BECOME SO

2344
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
OBSESSED WITH ONLINE AND GAME OR

2345
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
WASTE IS.

2346
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
AMERICA LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT

2347
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
THANKED 30 YEARS AGO.

2348
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
WE DON'T INTERACT WITH EACH

2349
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
OTHER THE WAY WE DID 30 YEARS

2350
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
AGO.

2351
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
FAITH HAS BEEN DIMINISHED AS

2352
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
WELL.

2353
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
FAITH HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S

2354
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
BEEN A COMMON THREAD IN AMERICA

2355
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
THAT BOUND US TO ONE ANOTHER FOR

2356
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
SO LONG.

2357
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
>> IT HAS BEEN A COMMON THREAD

2358
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
AND WE FIND TONIGHT TIMES LIKE

2359
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
THESE.
IN TRAGEDIES THAT'S WHERE WE

2360
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
TURN TO.

2361
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE AS A

2362
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
PEOPLE.

2363
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
INNATELY WE HAVE A NEED TO REACH

2364
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
OUT.

2365
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
AND IT'S ONLY WHEN WE TRUST OUR

2366
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
CREATOR.
AND THOSE WHO HAVE A

2367
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST OR

2368
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
SENSE OF SPIRITUALITY, BUT AS I

2369
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
COME FROM THE EVANGELICAL WORLD,

2370
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
IT HELPS US PROCESS THIS GRIEF.

2371
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
MEGYN: IT HELPS US LOOK OUT FOR

2372
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
ONE ANOTHER.

2373
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
YOU GO TO CHURCH JUST TO BIND

2374
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
WITH THE COMMUNITY, TO HAVE THAT

2375
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
SHARED EXPERIENCE.

2376
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
IT COULD BE A CONCERT.

2377
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
THE SHARED EXPERIENCE OF UP AND

2378
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
DOWN AND TOGETHER AND BOND.

2379
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
BUT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT BOND.

2380
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
>> IT KEEPS US ACCOUNT BE AS

2381
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
INDIVIDUALS.

2382
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
IT KEEPS US CONNECT CANDIDATE AS

2383
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
A COMMUNITY.

2384
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:06,000
AND THAT'S WHY -- IT KEEPS US

2385
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
CONNECTED AS A COMMUNITY.

2386
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:14,000
WE SEE A CALLOUSNESS AND

2387
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
COARSENESS OF OUR SOCIETY THAT

2388
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
IS TROUBLING TO ALL OF US.

2389
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
IF I WERE TO SAY RELIGION WOULD

2390
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS, RELATIONSHIP

2391
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
WON'T SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS.

2392
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,000
HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH

2393
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
CHRIST, WITH THE JUDEO CHRISTIAN

2394
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
WORLD VIEW, THAT MAKES SENSE FOR

2395
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
US INDIVIDUALLY.

2396
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
BUT AS A SOCIETY WE MOVED AWAY

2397
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
FROM THAT.
AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE

2398
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
BRING THAT BACK IN AND NOT HE

2399
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
CAN COLLUDE IT FROM THE PUBLIC

2400
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
SQUARE.

2401
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:49,000
IT IS -- AND NOT EXCLUDE IT FROM

2402
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
THE PUBLIC SQUARE.

2403
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
WHO KNOWS WHAT MOTIVATED THIS

2404
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
GUY TO DO THIS.

2405
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
BUT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING OUT

2406
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
FOR OTHERS AND HAVING A MORAL

2407
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
STANDARD OF WHAT'S ACCEPTABLE

2408
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
AND WHAT'S NOT.

2409
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
CLEARLY THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

2410
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
BUT HOW DO WE PREVENT TRAGEDIES

2411
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
LIKE THIS FROM OCCURRING AGAIN?

2412
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
MEGYN: A LOT OF PEOPLE GO TO

2413
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
TEMPLE, THEY GO TO CHURCH ON A

2414
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
DAY LIKE THIS AND LOOK TO

2415
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
CONNECT WITH THEIR FELLOW HUMAN

2416
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
BECOMES TO REMIND THEMSELVES WE

2417
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
ARE HERE TOGETHER AND WE HAVE

2418
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
THIS SHARED EXPERIENCE.

2419
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
FOR SOME OF US THERE IS A HIGHER

2420
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
POWER THAT WILL HELP US THROUGH

2421
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
IT.
>> WE SHOULD ALL BE PRAYING FOR

2422
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
THESE FAMILIES TODAY.

2423
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:32,000
AS A FAVORIT -- AS A PARENT OF A

2424
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
5-YEAR-OLD I CAN ONLY TELL YOU

2425
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
MY HEART IS BROKEN FOR THEM.

2426
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000

2427
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000

2428
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,000
WE'LL BE BACK IN MOMENT WITH

BROTHERS AND SISTERS OF THOSE 18

2434
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000

I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WOULD WAKE

2435
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000

>> THAT'S THE BEST THING, BY THE

2438
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
WAY YOU CAN TELL THEM.

2439
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD TELL THEM

2440
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
THIS OFFICE.

2441
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I CANNOT FATHOM THE DEPTH OF

2442
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
YOUR GRIEF.

2443
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR YOUR

2444
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
COURAGE.
I THINK SOMEWHERE OUT OF YOUR

2445
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
INCREDIBLE WOUND COULD COME

2446
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
EXTRAORDINARY SENSITIVITY SUCH

2447
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
THAT YOU WOULD BE AN INCREDIBLE

2448
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
GIFT TO OTHER PEOPLE IN LIFE.

2449
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
YET I HESITATE TO ASK THAT OF

2450
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
YOU KNOWING NOW HOW MUCH YOU ARE

2451
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
SUFFERING.
YET I KNOW THAT'S POSSIBLE FOR

2452
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
YOU.

2453
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
BUT I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW

2454
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
EVERYTHING YOU ARE FEELING AND I

2455
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
INVITE TO YOU TELL ME, PLEASE

01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
TELL ME, BECAUSE SILENCE IS THE

THAT.

2481
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
WE DID HEAR EARLIER THAT THE

2482
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
BODY OF A WOMAN HAD BEEN FOUND

2483
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000

KEN, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

2492
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
SOMETHING DIDN'T GO RIGHT HERE.

2493
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,000
HOW CAN WE LEARN FROM IT?

2494
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,000
>> AS YOU KNOW, AS A MOTHER, I

2495
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
WAS STANDING ON THE PLAY GROUND

2496
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
OF MY OWN CHILDREN'S SCHOOL

2497
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
SUPERVISING ELEMENTARY KIDS AS

2498
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
THIS STARTED BREAK AS A FAVORITE

2499
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
VOLUNTEER.
WE KNOW AT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

2500
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
LEVELS VERY OFTEN WHEN WE SEE

2501
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
VIOLENCE INCIDENTS ARISE,

2502
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
SHOOTINGS OR ALTER CASES, THEY

2503
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
COME FROM DOMESTIC SITUATIONS

2504
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
BETWEEN PARENTS, NON-CUSTODIAL

2505
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
PARENTS, OR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES.

2506
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
SO AS THIS NEWS IS UNFOLDING

2507
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBE COULD

2508
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
POSSIBLY FIT SOME OF THE THINGS

2509
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST.

2510
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I WANT TO SAY FIRST MY PRAYERS

2511
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
GOING OUT TO THE FAMILIES AS A

2512
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,000
FATHER, THAT PARENTS NEED TO

2513
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
ACROSS THE NATION ARE GOING TO

2514
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
BE ASKING QUESTIONS AT THEIR

2515
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
CHILDREN'S SCHOOL.
THEY ARE DOING SO NOW EVEN AT MY

2516
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
OWN SCHOOL.

2517
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I JUST GOT A TEXT.

2518
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
PARENTS NEED TO REMEMBER THEY

2519
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
SHOULD BE SENDING THEIR KIDS TO

2520
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
SCHOOL NEXT WEEK BECAUSE THIS IS

2521
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
THE TIME WHERE SCHOOLS ACROSS

2522
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
THE COUNTRY WILL BE SAFER

2523
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
BECAUSE THIS IS THE FOREFRONT OF

2524
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
OUR MINDS.

2525
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
WHAT I WANT PARENTS TO KNOW IS

2526
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT SCHOOL

2527
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
SAFETY IN THE WEEKS, MONTHS AND

2528
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
YEARS AHEAD.

2529
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,000
AS WE LOOKED A AT BUDGET CUTS AT

2530
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
SCHOOL, FOCUS ON IMPORTANT

2531
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
THINGS.

2532
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
TEST SCORES, FINANCIAL ISSUES.

2533
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
IT'S EASIER TO SCHOOL SAFETY TO

2534
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
FALL TO THE BACK BURNER.

2535
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
YOU HIT ON SOMETHING IMPORTANT

2536
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
EARLIER WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT OR

2537
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
ALLUDED TO TRAINING OUR STAFF.

2538
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
WE COULD HAVE THE LOCKS ON THE

2539
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
DOORS, THE BUZZERS, THE

2540
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
INTERCOMS.
WE HAVE TO TRAIN OUR SCHOOL

2541
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
EMPLOYEES.
WE HAVE TO TRAIN OUR PARENTS NOT

2542
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
TO PIGGY BACK IN WHEN SOMEONE

2543
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
AHEAD OF THEM GOES IN THE DOOR.

2544
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT SITUATIONS

2545
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
IN OUR FAMILIES AND SHARE THOSE

2546
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
AS SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WITH OUR

2547
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
EMPLOYERS IF THERE IS A RISK AND

2548
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
WE NEED TO BE WORKING WITH

2549
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
AGE-APPROPRIATE LEVELS WITH KIDS

2550
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
TO HAVE DRILLS.

2551
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
WE DON'T NEED TO TEACH

2552
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
KINDERGARTEN KIDS TO ATTACK

2553
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,000
ARMED INTRUDERS AND THROW

2554
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
PENCILS AT THEM AND I DON'T

2555
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
THINK WE NEED A METAL DETECTOR

2556
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
AT EVERY DOOR.
BUT WE NEED ALERT STAFF.

2557
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
WE NEED TO DO OUR TRAINING.

2558
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
MEGYN: I WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS

2559
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:30,000
EARLIER WITH BOB TSTRANG.

2560
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
SHOULD PARENTS THINK ABOUT

2561
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
POOLING THEIR RESOURCES TO PAY

2562
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
FOR ARMED SECURITY GUARDS?

2563
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
DO WE NEED THEM AT SCHOOLS TO

2564
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
PROTECT OUR KIDS?

2565
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
IF AN ARMED SECURITY GUARD HAD

2566
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
BEEN ON SITE COULD THIS MAN HAVE

2567
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
UNLEASHED THE TYPE OF DAMAGE HE

2568
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
DID?
>> WE HAVE SCHOOL-BASED POLICE

2569
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
OFFICERS.

2570
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
THERE IS SOME CIVIL RIGHTS AND

2571
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS HAVE

2572
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
JUST THIS WEEK BEEN BEFORE

2573
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
CONGRESS COMPLAINING ABOUT

2574
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
POLICE OFFICERS IN SCHOOLS.

2575
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

2576
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THE ROLE

2577
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
OF THE OFFICER.

2578
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
I SUPPORT HAVING SCHOOL-BASED

2579
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,000
OFFICERS.
MEGYN: MY APOLOGIES.

2580
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
BREAKING NEWS OUTSIDE OF THE

2581
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
HOSPITAL.

2582
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
>> THEY GAVE LIMITED

2583
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
INFORMATION.
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THREE

2584
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
PATIENTS WHO WERE BROUGHT HERE.

2585
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
BUT THEY WOULD NOT GO INTO

2586
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
PARTICULARS ABOUT WHO THESE

2587
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
PEOPLE ARE.

2588
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
WHETHER THEY ARE MALE OR FEMALE,

2589
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
CHILDREN OR ADULT.

2590
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
THEY WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING

2591
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
WHATSOEVER.

2592
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
THEY SAIDER IN THE PROCESS OF

2593
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
NOTIFYING THE FAMILIES.

2594
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
AND MAYBE THEY WOULD END UP

2595
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
HAVING A NEWS CONFERENCE IN THE

2596
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
NEXT HALF-HOUR TO AN HOUR OR SO.

2597
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
AT THAT POINT THEY ARE STILL NOT

2598
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,000
SAYING WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO
BE GIVING US ANY MORE

2599
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
INFORMATION AS FAR AS THE

2600
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
PARTICULARS OF THESE PEOPLE.

2601
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
HOWEVER, WE DID HEAR THAT WHO

2602
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
THESE THREE PEOPLE ARE.
ONE IS A TEACHER WHO WAS SHOT

2603
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
EITHER IN THE FOOT OR THE LEG.

2604
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
AND THE OTHER TWO ARE CHILDREN.

2605
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
WE WERE TOLD OR WE ARE HEARING

2606
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,000
THAT THOSE INJURIES ARE NOT

2607
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
LIFE-THREATENING.

2608
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
WHICH IS SO GOOD, THAT'S SUCH

2609
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
GOOD NEWS TO HEAR ABOUT THESE

2610
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
THREE PEOPLE CONSIDERING THE

2611
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,000
TRAGEDY THAT THIS TOWN AND ALL

2612
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
OF THESE POOR FAMILIES ARE

2613
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
DEALING WITH.

2614
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
WE HAVE CAMERAS SET UP HERE.

2615
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
YOU HAVE THE LOCAL REPORTERS IN

2616
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
CONNECTICUT AS WELL AS REPORTERS

2617
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
FROM NEW YORK WHO CAME UP.

2618
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE CAMERAS

2619
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
LINED UP THERE WAITING TO SEE

2620
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
WHETHER THERE WILL BE A NEWS

2621
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
CONFERENCE.
THE LOCATION WHERE THEY HAVE

2622
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
US -- WE ARE ON THE CAMPUS OF

2623
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
THE HOSPITAL BUT WE ARE AT THE

2624
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
MEDICAL ARTS CENTER.

2625
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
MEGYN: THE THREE VICTIMS -- WE

2626
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,000
WERE TOLD THREE VICTIMS WERE

2627
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL IN

2628
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
CONNECTICUT.
WE HAD PRECIOUS LITTLE

2629
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
INFORMATION ON THEM.

2630
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,000
NOW, YOU HEARD IT FROM OUR WNYW

2631
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
AFFILIATE REPORTER THAT THEY ARE

2632
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
BELIEVED TO BE IN A POSITION TO

2633
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,000
RECOVER.
THEIR WOUND ARE NOT

2634
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,000
LIFE-THREATENING.
THAT'S A BIG RELIEF IN A DAY OF

2635
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY.

2636
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
KEN, YOU WERE TOUCHING ON THE

2637
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
ISSUE OF ARMED GUARDS IN SCHOOL

2638
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
AND YOU A RAISE AN INTERESTING

2639
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
ISSUE.

2640
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
SOME PEOPLE HAVE A REAL

2641
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
OBJECTION TO THAT.

2642
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I SUPPOSE THE THOUGHT IS DO WE

2643
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
WANT TO HAVE SOMEBODY WITH A

2644
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
LOADED GUN WALKING AROUND OUR

2645
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
SCHOOL CAMPUSES WHEN IT MAY NOT

2646
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
BE NECESSARY.

2647
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
WHEN THANK GOD IN 99% OF

2648
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S NEVER

2649
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
NECESSARY.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE WORK

2650
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,000
HARD AT IN TRAINING SCHOOLS IS

2651
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH

2652
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
THEIR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

2653
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
THERE ARE MANY SCHOOL POLICE

2654
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
OFFICERS ASSIGNED FROM LOCAL LAW

2655
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
ENFORCEMENT COUNTY SHERIFF'S

2656
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
DETECTIVES.

2657
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
STATE POLICE OFFICERS, IN SOME

2658
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
CASES LOCAL POLICE, WHO DO WORK

2659
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
IN OUR SCHOOLS AND MOST OF THEM

2660
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
PERFORM A PREVENTATIVE ROLE.

2661
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
THEY BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH

2662
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
KIDS.
THEY FIND OUT ABOUT THESE ISSUES

2663
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
THAT START AT HOME.

2664
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
THINGS THAT MAY SPILL OVER INTO

2665
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
THE SCHOOL.

2666
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I THINK THAT ONE TOOL.

2667
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:08,000
TRYING TO LOGISTICALLY PUT AN

2668
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
OFFICER IN EVERY ELEMENTARY

2669
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
SCHOOL WOULD BE AN

2670
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGE,

2671
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
FINANCIAL CHALLENGE AND I'M NOT

2672
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
SURE IF IT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD

2673
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
BE ABLE TO DO IN THE SHORT TERM.

2674
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
THE FIRST AND BEST LINE OF

2675
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
DEFENSE IS A WELL-TRAINED HIGHLY

2676
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
ALERT SCHOOL STAFF AND STUDENT

2677
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
BODY WHO HAS RELATIONSHIPS WITH

2678
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
THEIR MENTAL HEALTH, POLICE AND

2679
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
COMMUNITY SPONSORS.

2680
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
WE NEED MENTAL DETECTORS.

2681
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
WE HAVE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL

2682
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
HEALTH ISSUES.

2683
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
IT'S NOT SOME REAL THING YOU CAN

2684
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
GET YOUR HAND ON THAT'S

2685
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
CONCRETE.

2686
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
WE DON'T DEAL WITH THAT WELL IN

2687
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
OUR SOCIETY.

2688
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
MEGYN: IF THE LAST FEW YEARS

2689
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
HAVEN'T PROVED THAT, I DON'T

2690
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
KNOW WHAT THEY PROVED.

2691
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
>> I HAVE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS

2692
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
25 YEARS AND I HAVE A VERY

2693
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
STRANGE FEELING AS I SIT HERE

2694
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
TALK WITH YOU TODAY.

2695
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
AS A FAVORITE, SEND YOUR KIDS TO

2696
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
SCHOOL, TALK WITH YOUR SCHOOL

2697
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
OFFICIALS, DON'T PANIC.

2698
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
FIND OUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

2699
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
SEE HOW YOU CAN SUPPORT.

2700
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
GO OUT ON THE PLAYGROUND IF YOU

2701
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:16,000
CAN AND HELP SUPERVISE.

2702
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
THAT'S WORTH A MILLION DOLLARS.

2703
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
MEGYN: I WANT TO GET TO TRACE

2704
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
GALLAGHER.

2705
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS ON THE

2706
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
SHOOTER AND HIS MOTHER.

2707
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,000
>> Reporter: THE INFORMATION

2708
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
WE HAVE IS THERE IS A

2709
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,000
POSSIBILITY THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER

2710
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
MAY HAVE BEEN A TEACHER AT THE

2711
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
SCHOOL.

2712
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
BUT THEN WE WENT ONTO THE WEB

2713
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
SITE OF THE SCHOOL AND THE TWO

2714
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS DON'T

2715
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
SOUNDS LIKE IT WOULD BE THE

2716
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
MOTHER.
THESE ARE REPORTS COMING OUT OF

2717
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
THERE.

2718
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
WE HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THEM.

2719
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THE

2720
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,000
MOTHER WORKED AT THE SCHOOL.

2721
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
GOING ON TO KIND OF AS WE SCAN

2722
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:51,000
THIS, RYAN LANZA LIVED IN

2723
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY.

2724
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
HE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL IN

2725
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

2726
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
FROM NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

2727
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,000
HIS MOM LIVED IN NEWTOWN,

2728
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
CONNECTICUT AND APPARENTLY HAD

2729
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,000
SOME CONNECTION TO THE SCHOOL.

2730
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
HE WAS A GRADUATE OF NEWTOWN

2731
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
HIGH SCHOOL.

2732
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
AND POLICE CONFIRMED THERE WAS A

2733
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
BODY FOUND IN THERE.

2734
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
AND IT IS A VERY STRONG

2735
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
POSSIBILITY THE BODY WAS THE

2736
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
SHOOTER'S MOTHER.
WE ARE NOW TRYING TO GET MORE

2737
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT HE DID

2738
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
FOR WORK.

2739
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
MEGYN: JUST TO JUMP IN.

2740
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
OUR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SOURCES

2741
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
ARE TELLING US THAT RYAN LANZA'S

2742
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
MOTHER NANCY IS PRESUMED DEAD.

2743
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE BEING TOLD.

2744
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
HIS MOTHER IS BEING PRESUMED

2745
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
DEAD.

2746
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
THAT SHE DID WORK AT THAT SCHOOL

2747
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
WHERE THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE.

2748
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
BUT IT'S UNCLEAR IF SHE WAS

2749
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
KILLED IN THE SCHOOL OR AT HER

2750
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,000
HOME.
ALSO BEING TOLD HIS PARENTS WERE

2751
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
DIVORCED.

2752
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
IT'S POSSIBLE THE MOTHER LIVED

2753
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
IN CONNECTICUT, THE FATHER IN

2754
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
NEW JERSEY.
SHE IS PRESUMED DEAD.

2755
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
THEY DON'T KNOW IF SHE WAS

2756
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
KILLED IN THE SCHOOL OR HER

2757
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
HOME.

2758
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,000
IT EARLIER INFORMATION WAS THEY

2759
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
FOUND A BODY IN THE HOME NEAR

2760
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
THE SCHOOL.

2761
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
>> Reporter: THAT'S THE

2762
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
INFORMATION WE HAVE.
THERE WAS A BODY FOUND INSIDE

2763
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
THE HOME BELONG TOGETHER MOTHER

2764
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT AND SHE

2765
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
WORKED FOR THE SCHOOL.

2766
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
AND THE REPORT WENT ON TO SAY

2767
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
THE BELIEF WAS THAT HE TARGETED

2768
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
THE MOTHER FIRST, THEN WENT AND

2769
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
WAS TARGETING THE STUDENTS AT

2770
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
THE SCHOOL.

2771
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
REMEMBER IF YOU LOOK AT THE

2772
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
CHAIN OF EVENTS.

2773
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
HE WAS LET THROUGH THE DOOR

2774
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:25,000
SOMETIME BETWEEN 9:30 AND 9:40.

2775
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,000
WENT TO THE AD MIN STRAY TOUGH

2776
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,000
OFFICE AND OPENED FIRE DURING

2777
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
THE MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS AND

2778
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
ATTACKED THE PRINCIPAL AND VICE

2779
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
PRINCIPAL AND PSYCHOLOGIST.

2780
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,000
THE NURSE WAS IN THERE.

2781
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
WHILE THE MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS

2782
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
WERE BEING MADE THE REST OF THE

2783
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
SCHOOL COULD HEAR THE VIOLENCE

2784
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
AND GUNFIRE OVER THE SCHOOL

2785
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
INTERCOM.
AT THAT POINT APPARENTLY WENT TO

2786
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,000
A CLASSROOM.

2787
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,000
WE KNOW A KINDERGARTEN CLASS IS

2788
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
UNACCOUNTED FOR.

2789
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CLASSROOM HE

2790
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,000
WENT TO.

2791
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
BUT HE APPARENTLY WENT TO A

2792
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
CLASSROOM AND SHOT AND KILLED 18

2793
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
KID.
THE INFORMATION WE ARE GETTING

2794
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
IS HE APPARENTLY WAS GOING TO

2795
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
THE SCHOOL TO TARGET THE KIDS TO

2796
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,000
BEGIN WITH.

2797
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
WHETHER THESE WERE HER STUDENTS

2798
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
OR FORMER STUDENTS, STILL HAVE

2799
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,000
MUCH UNCONFIRMED.
BUT WE ARE WORKING TO FIND OUT

2800
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
MUCH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT

2801
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
24-YEAR-OLD RYAN LANZA.

2802
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
MEGYN: MOMENT AFTER WE REPORTED

2803
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND

2804
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
THE "NEW YORK TIMES," ALSO

2805
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
REPORTING NOW THAT THE ALLEGED

2806
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
SCHOOL GUNMAN KILLED HIS MOTHER

2807
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
WHO WAS A TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL

2808
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,000
ALONG WITH STUDENT AND OTHERS.

2809
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
THE STORY DOES APPEAR TO BE

2810
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
GETTING MORE CLEAR AT THIS HOUR.

2811
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
THOUGH UNDERSTANDING IT REMAINS

2812
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
IMPOSSIBLE.

2813
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
WE ARE ALSO JUST GETTING

2814
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
COMMENTS FROM A FATHER ON THE

2815
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
SCENE WHO SPOKE ABOUT THE HORROR

2816
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,000
THAT ANY PARENT WOULD FEEL UPON

2817
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
HEARING THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL HAS

2818
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
BEEN TARGETED BY A GUNMAN.

2819
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:52,000
>> THERE IS NO WORDS IT'S SHEER

2820
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
TERROR, AND A SENSE OF IMMEDIATE

2821
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
URGENCY, AND, YOU KNOW, TO GET

2822
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
TO YOUR CHILD AND TO BE INTO

2823
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
PROTECT THEM.

2824
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE IMMEDIATE

2825
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
THING.
IS MY CHILD HURT?

2826
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
THEY ARE ALONE, THEY ARE NOT

2827
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:11,000
WITH ME.
HOW DO I GET TO THEM.

2828
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
MEGYN: THE PARENTS WERE OUT

2829
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
THERE.
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE PANIC.

2830
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,000
THE FULL-BODY PANIC.

2831
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
YOU CAN SEE TONIGHT SOME OF THE

2832
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
PICTURES.

2833
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
THERE WAS ONE MOTHER I SAW

2834
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,000
EARLIER, YOU COULD SEE HER

2835
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
RINGING HER HANDS -- YOU COULD

2836
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,000
SEE HER RINGING HER HANDS.

2837
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,000
THERE HAS TO BE A GUILING

2838
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
FEELING AS WELL.

2839
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
FORGIVE ME I'M HEARING

2840
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL MAKE ON

2841
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
CAMERA COMMENTS ON THIS COMING

2842
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
UP MOMENTARILY.

2843
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
I BELIEVE JUST AFTER 3:00 P.M.

2844
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
EASTERN TIME THE PRESIDENT WILL

2845
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:54,000
SPEAK TO THIS INCREDIBLY AWFUL

2846
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING IN CONNECTICUT

2847
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
THAT BEGAN TODAY.

2848
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
WE WERE HOPING THERE WERE

2849
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
INITIAL REPORTS ON ANOTHER

2850
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
CHANNEL THAT NO CHILDREN WERE

2851
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
INJURED.
NO REPORTS OF CHILDREN INJURED

2852
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
IT READ.

2853
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
NOW WE KNOW THE TRUTH IS VERY,

2854
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,000
VERY DIFFERENT.

2855
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,000
WANT TO GET BACK TO DR. KIET

2856
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,000
ABLOW.

2857
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
-- DR. KEITH ABLOW.

2858
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
THOSE DUAL FEELINGS OF THANK GOD

2859
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:22,000
IT WASN'T MY CHILD, THEN THE

2860
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
AWFUL GUILT OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT

2861
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
THE WORLD IS WHEN YOU REALIZE

2862
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
YOU ARE FEELING HE LATE AS OTHER

2863
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
PARENTS ARE MOURNING THE DEATH

2864
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
OF THEIR 5-YEAR-OLD WHO DIED AT

2865
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
AT HAND OF A GUNMAN WHO GUNNED

2866
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
THEM DOWN LIKE THEY WERE

2867
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
NOTHING.
>> THE RAN DOCUMENT AND CRUEL

2868
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
NATURE OF THIS KIND OF ACT

2869
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
COMPLICATES THINGS

2870
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
PSYCHOLOGICALLY EVEN FOR THE

2871
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
SURVIVORS WHO WILL NEED HELP

2872
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
LATER ON TO TRY TO PUT THIS IN

2873
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,000
SOME KIND OF PERSPECTIVE.

2874
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
BECAUSE I WORKED WITH PEOPLE

2875
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR WHOM EITHER

2876
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:00,000
HAVING A TRAGEDY VISIT OR HAVING

2877
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
SURVIVED SIT, WHEN A SIBLING IS

2878
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
STRICKEN WITH CANCER.

2879
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
HAVING NOT BEEN THE ONE TO GET

2880
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
SICK LEADS THEM TO FEEL UNSAFE.

2881
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
THE RANDOMNESS OF IT.

2882
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
UNFAIRNESS OF IT.
THE FACT THAT IS THERE NOT A LOT

2883
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,000
YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL CAN DO TO

2884
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
PROTECT YOURSELF FROM IT MAKES

2885
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
PEOPLE VISIT THEIR OWN MORTALITY

2886
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
AND THAT FINE THREAD FROM WHICH

2887
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
WE ALL HANG.

2888
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
EARLIER THAN YOU HAD HOPED.

2889
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
HASN'T WHAT THESE KIDS ARE

2890
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,000
CONTENDING WITH.

2891
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
THESE WILL BE FOREVER SPECIAL

2892
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,000
CHILDREN PERHAPS, CAPABLE OF

2893
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
EXTRAORDINARY BRAVERY OR EMA ANY

2894
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,000
BUT ALSO VULNERABLE IN A SPECIAL

2895
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
WAY.
MEGYN: YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT WE

2896
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
ARE HEAR BEING THIS ACT PAT WE

2897
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
BELIEVE THIS GUNMAN KILLED HIS

2898
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
MOTHER.

2899
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:52,000
WE BELIEVE IN THE HOUSE OUTSIDE

2900
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
OF THE SCHOOL.
AND IT APPEARS HE MAY HAVE

2901
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
KILLED HIS MOTHER WHO ARE WAS A

2902
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
TEACHER IN THIS SCHOOL.

2903
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
>> MY THOUGHTS ARE THIS.

2904
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
AS MORE FACTS COME IN, THIS WILL

2905
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
LIKELY BE ANOTHER STORY WHERE

2906
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:10,000
YOU SAY, WELL, THE UNTHINKABLE

2907
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
AND INEXPLICABLE NOW IS

2908
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,000
FATHOMABLE.

2909
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
WE CAN SEE THE TRAIN COMING DOWN

2910
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
THE TRACKS.

2911
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
THE AWFUL COLLISION COMING AND

2912
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
SADLY SPECTATORS BY THE RAILWAY

2913
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
WHO FELT DISEMPOWERED OR DIDN'T

2914
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
FILE WAS THEIR PLACE TO

2915
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
INTERVENE OR EVEN A THERAPIST

2916
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
WHO DIDN'T THINK IT WAS TIME TO

2917
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,000
PULL THE TRIGGER AND HOSPITALIZE

2918
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,000
THIS PERSON, I THINK RIGHT NOW

2919
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,000
THIS CAN BE SADLY A LABORATORY

2920
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
WHERE WE LOOK AND SAY WHAT COULD

2921
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,000
HAVE BEEN DONE.

2922
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
IF IT'S NOTHING, FINE.

2923
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
BUT IT IS LIKELY THERE WILL BE

2924
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
THINGS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN

2925
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,000
DONE.
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY OF MY

2926
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,000
COLLEAGUES -- I DON'T MEAN TO

2927
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
CALL ANYBODY OUT HERE -- BUT IN

2928
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
THE MENTAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM I

2929
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
SOMETIMES MAKE STRANGE CALLS TO

2930
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
E.R.s WHERE I WILL SAY YOU

2931
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
HAVE GOT TO HOSPITALIZE THIS

2932
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
PERSON HE WAS IN MY OFFICE AN

2933
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
SAYS HE WANTS TO KILL SOMEBODY.

2934
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
YOU WILL HEAR BACK FROM A

2935
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
CLINICIAN, WELL, HE'S NOT SAYING

2936
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
THAT NOW.

2937
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
I SAID NOW HE'S IN THE E.R. AND

2938
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
HE'S SAYING THAT TO LEAVE.

2939
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,000
THEY SAY HE'S CONTRACTING FOR

2940
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
SAFETY AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY

2941
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
SAYS THEY WON'T PAY NOW.

2942
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
SO WE HAVE SO MUCH FIXING TO DO.

2943
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,000
MEGYN: WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE?

2944
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
32 DEAD AT VIRGINIA TECH JUST A

2945
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
COUPLE YEARS AGO AND WE DIDN'T

2946
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
REVAMP' THE MENTAL HEALTH

2947
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,000
SYSTEM.
NOW YOU HAVE 18 DEAD KIDS.

2948
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
IS THIS ENOUGH?
>> I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ENOUGH

2949
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,000
BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH STIGMA

2950
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
ATTACHED TO THE MENTAL

2951
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:47,000
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.
THERE IS SO MUCH RECEIPT SENSE H

2952
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
RETISCENCE.

2953
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:01,000
WE HAVE SOME TO EMPOWER PEOPLE

2954
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
TO GIVE TREATMENT TO THOSE TO

2955
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
DON'T WANT TREATMENT.

2956
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:10,000
MEGYN: FOX NEWS CONFIRMING RYAN

2957
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
LANZA, THAT HIS FATHER WAS ALSO

2958
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
KILLED IN HIS HOME IN NEW

2959
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
JERSEY.
THIS IS IN ADDITION TO HIS

2960
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
MOTHER BEING FOUND DEAD IN

2961
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
CONNECTICUT.
>> THESE STORIES IN MY

2962
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
EXPERIENCE AS A FORENSIC

2963
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
PSYCHIATRIST, THE STRANGERS WHO

2964
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:29,000
PAY THE TOLL ARE PAYING IT FOR

2965
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,000
INTENSELY PERSONAL DRAMAS.

2966
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
CONNECTED USUALLY TO INCREDIBLY

2967
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
INTENSE PSYCHOLOGICAL CONFLICTS

2968
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE VERY

2969
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
CLOSE TO EACH OTHER.

2970
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
WE SEE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.

2971
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
PEOPLE KILL BECAUSE THERE IS A

2972
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
SPOUSE AT SODS WITH HIS WIFE

2973
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
WHO -- SPOUSE AT ODDS WITH HIS

2974
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
WIFE.

2975
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
MEGYN: I KNOW YOU CAN'T ANSWER

2976
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
THIS BUT I HAVE TO TRY.

2977
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I THINK WE ARE ALL TRYING.

2978
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,000
THEN WHAT MAKES YOU KILL A

2979
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
KINDERGARTEN FULL OF BABIES.

2980
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,000
>> THE TERRIBLE SENSE THAT YOU

2981
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:05,000
ARE DISEMPOWERED AND YOU ARE

2982
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
SPIRITUALLY DEAD MAKES YOU

2983
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
CREATE IN THE WORLD AN AWFUL

2984
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
CANVAS REPRESENTING YOUR

2985
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
INTERIOR WORLD.

2986
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE, BUT

2987
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:17,000
THAT IS ONE WAY TO SEE THIS.

2988
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,000
THAT YOU PROJECT THE FRAGMENTED

2989
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
NATURE OF YOUR INTERNAL WORLD.

2990
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,000
THE FACT THAT YOU FEEL

2991
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
DECIMATED.
YOU CREATE A SYMBOL OF THAT.

2992
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,000
AN AWFUL, TERRIBLE MONSTROUS

2993
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
SYMBOL OF IT THAT THIS WILL BE

2994
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
YOUR LEGACY.

2995
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
THAT YOU HAVE FINALLY SPOKEN AND

2996
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
SHOWN EVERYONE WHAT YOU HAVE

2997
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
BEEN FEELING INSIDE.

2998
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
THAT'S THE TERRIBLE, AWFUL

2999
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
TRUTH.

3000
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,000
MEGYN: THE SHOOTER IS 24 YEARS

3001
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,000
OLD.
THE SHOOTER AT THE MALL SHOOTING

3002
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
IN OREGON WAS 22 YEARS OLD.

3003
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
THESE ARE YOUNG GUYS.

3004
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
YOU MENTIONED HOW PEOPLE LOSE

3005
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
THEMSELVES IN CERTAIN ONLINE

3006
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000
ACTIVITY, GAME, WHAT HAVE YOU.

3007
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BACKGROUND

3008
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
WAS WITH THESE GUYS.

3009
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TOTALLY

3010
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
COINCIDENTALLY THAT THEY ARE

3011
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
BOTH IN THEIR YOUNG 20s AND

3012
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
YOUNG MEN.
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

3013
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,000
THE FORCES THAT EMPOWER PEOPLE

3014
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
TO GET SOME KNOWLEDGE THROUGH

3015
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
THE INTERNET.

3016
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF

3017
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
DEHUMANIZING FORCES THAT COME

3018
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
WITH THAT.

3019
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
REALITY TV IS NO FRIEND OF

3020
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
PREVENTING SUCH THINGS.

3021
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
FACEBOOK IS NO FRIEND OF

3022
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
PREVENTING SUCH THINGS I HAVE TO

3023
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
SAY.
AND I THINK WE ARE AT A TIME

3024
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,000
AGAIN AND WE MENTIONED THIS

3025
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
EARLIER.

3026
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
WE PUSHED THE RED LINE OF THE

3027
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
UNTHINKABLE INTO KINDERGARTEN

3028
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
CLASSROOMS.
WE HAVE GOT TO DIAL IT BACK.

3029
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
WE HAVE GOT TO SHOW A BIG

3030
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,000
RESPONSE HERE OF GRIEF, EMPATHY,

3031
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
OUTREACH TO BALANCE THE

3032
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,000
MONSTROUSITY OF THIS.

3033
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
THAT'S SOME KIND OF INSULATION

3034
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
AGAINST SOMEONE SAYING I THINK

3035
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
THAT MY FORUM.

3036
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING TO

3037
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,000
EXPRESS MYSELF.

3038
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,000
HOW FRACTURED I FEEL IS GOING TO

3039
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,000
BE SEEN IN THE BLOOD ON THE

3040
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
FLOOR OF THIS CLASSROOM.

3041
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
MEGYN: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

3042
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
HELPING US.

3043
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE.

3044
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
I WANT TO BRING YOU THIS SAD

3045
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
UPDATE AS WELL.

3046
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN KILLED

3047
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
HAS NOW BEEN INCREASED TO 20.

3048
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,000
20 CHILDREN DEAD.

3049
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:21,000
FIVE ADULT DEAD AND THE SHORT.

3050
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:25,000
26 DEAD, 20 OF THEM CHILDREN.

3051
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY
HAS NOT INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED

3052
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
THESE ARE KINDERGARTENERS.

3053
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,000
THAT IS OUR BELIEF BASED OTHER

3054
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,000
REPORTING.
ONE FATHER SAID HIS ON WAS IN

3055
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:41,000
CLASS WHEN THE GUNMAN BURST IN

3056
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
AND SHOT THE TEACHER.

3057
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
HE GRABBED A BUNCH OF OF HIS

3058
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
FRIEND AND RAN.

3059
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
THE SHOOTER DID NOT SAY A WORD.

3060
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL SPEAK TO

3061
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,000
THE NATION AT 3:15 P.M. EASTERN

3062
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
TIME.
WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US

3063
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,000
ON THIS IMPORTANT NEWS DAY.

3064
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
WE'LL GET THROUGH IT TOGETHER.

3065
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
THEN WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT

3066
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
TOGETHER.

3067
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
BUT OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES NOW

3068
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:10,000
WITH "STUDIO B."

3069
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
>> THERE IS NO WORDS IT OF THE

3070
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
SHEER TERROR AND SENSE OF

3071
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
IMMEDIATE URGENCY AND TO GET TO

3072
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
YOUR CHILD AND TO BE THERE TO

3073
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
PROTECT THEM.

3074
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
THAT WHAT YOU WANT -- THAT'S THE

3075
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
IMMEDIATE THING, IS MY CHILD

3076
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
HURT.
YOU KNOW, THEY ARE ALONE, THEY

3077
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
ARE NOT WITH ME.
YOU KNOW, HOW DO I GET TO THEM.

3078
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,000
ANNCR: Some politicians seem to
think Medicare and...

3079
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Social Security are just numbers
in a budget.

3080
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Well, we worked hard for those
benefits.

3081
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
We earned them.

3082
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,000
And if Washington tries to cram
decisions about the future...

3083
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
of these programs into a last
minute budget deal...

3084
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
we'll all pay the price.

3085
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,000
AARP is fighting to protect
seniors with responsible...

3086
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,000
solutions that strengthen
Medicare and...

3087
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Social Security for generations
to come.

3088
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
We can do better than a last
minute deal...

3089
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:10,000
that would hurt all of us.

3090
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
PROGRESSIVE DIRECT AND OTHER
CAR INSURANCE COMPANIES?
YES.

3091
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000

YES.
NO.

ARE YOU THEM?

3096
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,000

SO THEM ARE HERE.

3098

YES!

3099
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000

THROUGH IT AGAIN?
