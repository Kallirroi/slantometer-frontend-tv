THE PAST TWO MONTHS WE HAVE SEEN

EXCHANGES, SYRIAN ARMY ACCUSED

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
OF FIRING INTO TURKEY.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
TURKEY RETURNING FIRE.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
THAT SENSE OF HOST TILLITY AND

PATRIOTS COMING HERE AT THIS
POINT.

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
EXPECTED TO BE USED MOSTLY IN

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
THE EVENT OF MISSILES BEING

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
FIRED AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000

U.S. DOES HAVE A PLAN IN THE

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
EVENT THAT THEY SEE THE ASSAD

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
NOT CLEAR IF PATRIOTS WILL BE

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
INVOLVED IN THAT.

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
BUT RIGHT NOW, IN THE VERY

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
VOLATILE PART OF THE WORLD, WE

72
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
DEAL.

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
18 DAYS UNTIL THE FISCAL CLIFF.

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND JOHN BOEHNER

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
MET JUST UNDER AN HOUR.

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
AFTER COORDINATED PRESS

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
RELEASES, BOTH SIDES ASSURED THE

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT

DANA BASH IS LIVE IN WASHINGTON,

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
D.C. THIS MORNING.

88
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
50 MINUTES AND SORT OF A VERY

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
MILQUETOASTY KIND OF STATEMENT

90
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
AT THE END OF IT, SOUNDS NOT

91
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
GOOD.
>> NO, NOT GOOD, CONSIDERING

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
WHERE WE ARE IN THE CALENDACALE.

93
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'M TOLD BY SOURCES IN BOTH

94
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
PARTIES, A MEETING THAT DID NOT

95
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
PRODUCE ANY NEW IDEAS, MORE OF

96
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
TOUCHING BASE MEETING, THE

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
PRESIDENT WANTED TO TALK TO THE

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
SPEAKER BEFORE HE WENT HOME TO

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
OHIO, WHICH HE STILL PLANNED TO

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
DO THIS WEEKEND, THE SOURCES SAY

101
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
THAT THE BASIC PROBLEM STILL IS,

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
SOLEDAD, AFTER ALL OF THE WEEKS,

103
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
IS DEMOCRATS STILL BELIEVE

104
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
REPUBLICANS HAVE THE PROBLEM.

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
THEY NEED TO DEAL WITH THE DEBT

106
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
CRISIS BY RAISING MORE REVENUE,

107
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
MEANING RAISING MORE TAXES AND

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
REPUBLICANS STILL THINK

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
DEMOCRATS ARE THE PROBLEM.

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
THEY ARE NOT OFFERING ENOUGH IN

111
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
SPENDING CUTS.
THE ISSUE IS, REALITY,

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
DEMOCRATS, THE PRESIDENT HAS THE

113
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
MOST LEVERAGE.

114
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
HAS HAD THE MOST LEVERAGE,

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT.

116
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
EVERYBODY SEE WHERE IS THIS WILL

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
PROBABLY GO.

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
REPUBLICANS HAVE TO GIVE SOME ON

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THE RATE INCREASES FOR THE MOST

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
WEALTHY.
AND THE QUESTION, WHEN IS IT

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
MOST POLITICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
FOR BOTH SIDES TO AGREE TO THAT.

123
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
>> LET ME ASK A QUESTION.

124
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
YOU HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO

125
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
TWO FORMER MAJORITY LEADERS FROM

126
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE WHAT

127
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT WHERE WE

128
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
ARE AND THE FACT THAT THERE WILL

129
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
BE A DEAL SOMEWHERE SOON?

130
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
>> TRENT LOTT AND TOM DASCHLE,

131
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC

132
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
LEADER, OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE

133
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
TABLE FOUR YEARS, WORKING

134
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
TOGETHER ON TOUGH ISSUES AND

135
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
THEY POINTED OUT IT IS CERTAINLY

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
POSSIBLE, OF COURSE IT IS

137
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
POSSIBLE.
THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE POLITICAL

138
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
WILL IN TO THE POLITICAL LEADERS

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
AND THEY POINTED OUT THAT TIMING

140
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
ON A DEAL IS REALLY KEY.

141
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

142
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
>> VERY TRUE.

143
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
>>> THE SPEAKER IS GOING TO HAVE

144
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
TO MAKE A DECISION ON THAT, AND

145
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE

146
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
TO MAKE A DECISION ON WHAT HE

147
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
WILL DO IN RETURN ON SPENDING,

148
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
AND THEY NEED TO DO IT ON

149
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
CONCERT.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE WINDS AND

150
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
THE BRASS COME TOGETHER.

151
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
>> MAYBE HOLD HANDS AND JUMP OFF

152
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
THE CLIFF TOGETHER?

153
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
>> IT WOULD BE MORE FUN ON THE

154
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
WAY DOWN.
AT LEAST HAVE YOU COMPANY.

155
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
>> WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS ALL

156
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE THE ENDS

157
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
OF THE YEAR, REALLY STILL IS AN

158
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
OPEN QUESTION.
BUT, SOLEDAD, OUTSIDE A MEETING

159
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
OF REPUBLICANS YESTERDAY, AND

160
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
ALL OF THEM SAID THAT THE

161
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
SPEAKER TOLD THEM, DON'T MAKE

162
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
CHRISTMAS PLANS.
>> YEAH, NOT A SHOCK EITHER.

163
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
AND I THINK JUMPING OFF A CLIFF,

164
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
WHETHER YOU HAVE HANDS TO HOLD

165
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
OR NO HANDS TO HOLD IS ALL BAD,

166
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
ALL THE WAY DOWN.

167
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
DANA BASH THIS MORNING,

168
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
APPRECIATE IT.

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
FIRESTORM ON THE ATTACK IN

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
BENGHAZI, SUSAN RICE HAS TAKEN

172
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
HERSELF OUT OF THE RUNNING,

173
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
WON'T TRY TO SUCCEED SECRETARY

174
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON FOR

175
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
THAT ROLE.

176
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA TALKED ABOUT

177
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
AMBASSADOR RICE'S DECISION LAST

178
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
NIGHT.
>> I HADN'T MADE A DECISION

179
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
ABOUT WHO WOULD BE MY NEXT

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
SECRETARY OF STATE.
NO DOUBT, SUSAN IS QUALIFIED.

181
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
OTHER PEOPLE ARE QUALIFIED AS

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
WELL.

183
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
HER INTEREST IS IN SERVING ME,

184
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, IN SERVING

185
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
THE COUNTRY.

186
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
COULD NOT BE PROUDER OF HER.

187
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
SHE IS ONE OF THE TOP MEMBERS OF

188
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
MY NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM.

189
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
>> SHE'LL MEET WITH THE

190
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
PRESIDENT TODAY, OUR FOREIGN

191
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
AFFAIRS REPORTER, ELISE LABOTT

192
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

193
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
BREAK THIS DOWN WHAT'S HAPPENING

194
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
BEHIND THE SCENES.

195
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
SHE SAID IN HER RESIGNATION NOTE

196
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
THAT SHE'S DECIDED TO DO THIS

197
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
FOR THE GOOD OF THE AMERICAN

198
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
PEOPLE, SO THERE IS NOT THIS

199
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
CONTENTIOUS, PARTISAN DEBATE.

200
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING HERE?

201
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
>> WELL, I'VE TALKED TO SOME OF

202
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
OUR AIDES.

203
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
SHE WAS READY FOR A FIGHT.

204
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
SHE DOESN'T GIVE UP ON A FIGHT.

205
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
TWEETED THIS MORNING WITH AN

206
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
OP-ED IN "THE WASHINGTON POST,"

207
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
BUT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS

208
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
AND WEEKS, HER AIDES AND SHE

209
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
STARTED TO DO THE MATH.

210
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
WASN'T JUST ABOUT BENGHAZI

211
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
ANYMORE, MORPHED INTO SOMETHING

212
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
ELSE, ON OTHER ISSUES BACK WHEN

213
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
SHE WAS IN THE CLINTON

214
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
ADMINISTRATION, INCREASINGLY

215
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
POLITICIZED AND WASN'T GOING TO

216
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
STOP.
SO SHE MADE THE TOUGH DECISION

217
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
AND ALSO I THINK, SOLEDAD, HER

218
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
AIDES FELT THAT THIS DETRACTED

219
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
FROM SOME OF THE MORE SUCCESSFUL

220
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
WORK THAT SHE DID AS U.S.

221
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED

222
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
NATIONS.
IF YOU REMEMBER, SHE WAS

223
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
INSTRUMENTAL IN PASSING THE

224
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
TOUGHEST SANCTIONS EVER ON IRAN.

225
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
PUSHED FOR MILITARY ACTION IN

226
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
LIBYA AND OTHER THINGS.

227
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT SHE TOLD

228
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
NBC NEWS ABOUT WHY SHE WITHDRAW

229
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
H

230
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
HER NAME.
>> I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE A

231
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
CONFIRMATION PROCESS THAT WAS

232
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
VERY PROLONGED, VERY

233
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
POLITICIZED, VERY DISTRACTING

234
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
AND VERY DISRUPTIVE.

235
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS

236
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
WE NEED TO GET DONE AS A

237
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
COUNTRY.

238
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
>> AND, SOLEDAD, SHE HAS A LOT

239
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
OF WORK TO DO AT THE U.N.

240
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
RIGHT NOW, THE U.S. IS TRYING TO

241
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
GET A RESOLUTION IMPOSING

242
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000

CAIRO.

264
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
SHE A
MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION SAY

265
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
THE CONSTITUTION IS TOO ISLAMIST

266
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
AND INFRINGES ON MINORITY

267
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
RIGHTS.

268
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
PROTESTING OUTSIDE THE
PRESIDENTIAL PALACE RIGHT NOW.

269
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000

SO FAR, NO TSUNAMI WARNINGS.

REOPEN TO SHOPPERS IN SIX HOURS.

275
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
THAT'S THE MALL WHERE A GUNMAN

276
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
KILLED TWO PEOPLE ON TUESDAY AND

277
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
CRITICALLY WOUNDED A THIRD

278
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000

A CANDLE-LIGHT VIGIL WILL BE

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
HELD OUTSIDE THE MALL.

COWBOYS PLAYER JERRY BROWN.

283
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
SATURDAY.

286
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
HIS TEAMMATE AND FRIEND JOSH

287
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
BRENT WAS BEHIND THE WHEEL.

288
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
YOU ARE LOOKING AT NEW DASHCAM

289
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
VIDEO OF THE WRECK RELEASED BY

290
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
POLICE ALONG WITH 911 CALLS THEY

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
RECEIVED IN MOMENTS AFTER THE

292
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
ACCIDENT.
>> IS ANYBODY INJURED?

293
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.

294
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I JUST DROVE PAST IT.

295
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
LOOKS LIKE IT JUST HAPPENED.

296
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
A CAR UPSIDE DOWN.

297
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
>> JOSH BRENT IS FREE ON HALF A

298
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
MILLION DOLLARS BAIL.
HE'S CHARGED WITH INTOXICATION

299
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
MANSLAUGHTER.
>>> SO TODAY IS THE DEADLINE FOR

300
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
STATES TO DECLARE WHETHER THEY

301
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
WILL SET UP THEIR OWN HEALTH

302
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
INSURANCE EXCHANGES.

303
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
22 STATES WILL NOT DO IT.

304
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
IN THOSE CASES, THE AFFORDABLE

305
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
CARE ACT DICTATES THE FEDERAL

306
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
GOVERNMENT COMES IN AND WILL DO

307
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
IT FOR THEM.

308
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
THE EXCHANGES WILL OFFER

309
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
CONSUMERS AN INTERNET BASED

310
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
MARKETPLACE FOR PURCHASING

311
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS.

312
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
SO IT HASN'T COME TO THIS IN

313
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
WASHINGTON, D.C., YET.
THIS BRAWL BROKE OUT ON THE

314
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
FLOOR OF UKRAINE'S PARLIAMENT.

315
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
LOTS OF PUSHING, SHOVING, COLLAR

316
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
GRABBING, AND THE SCUFFLE

317
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
APPARENTLY STARTED AFTER MEMBERS

318
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
OF UKRAINE'S OPPOSITION PARTY

319
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
ACCUSED TWO OF THEIR OWN MEMBERS

320
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
OF PLANNING TO DEFECT TO THE

321
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
RULING PARTY.

322
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I GUESS THE GOOD NEWS, IT'S NOT

323
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
PARTISANSHIP, IT'S FIGHTING
WITHIN THE PARTY.

324
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
YOU KNOW, LOOKING FOR A SILVER

325
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
LINING.
>> THEY ARE TALKING.

326
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
NOT JUST SAYING WE HAD FRANK

327
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
DISCUSSIONS.
>> THOSE ARE MORE THAN FRANK

328
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
DISCUSSIONS RIGHT THERE.

329
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
>> CAN YOU IMAGINE IF WE HAD

330
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
VIDEO FISCAL CLIFF COME TO THIS

331
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
AND PEOPLE GOING AT EACH OTHER.

332
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
NO WOMEN AT THIS SHOT.

333
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I LOOKED VERY CLOSELY.

334
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
WHAT DOES THAT SAY?

335
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
>> SORRY BERMAN.

336
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
>>> AHEAD ON "STARTING POINT"

337
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
THIS MORNING, "BLACK IN AMERICA"

338
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
WILL REAIR ON SATURDAY.

339
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
AND AN ESPN HOST IS QUESTIONING

340
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
THE BLACKNESS OF A STAR FOOTBALL

341
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
PLAYER ROBERT GRIFFIN III, RG3

342
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
ON AIR, WHAT WAS SAID AND THE

343
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
FALLOUT FROM THAT, STRAIGHT

344
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
AHEAD.

345
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
PLUS, BUSINESS NEWS.

346
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
ONE MORE WAY THE FISCAL CLIFF

347
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
COULD COST YOU.
WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR PAYCHECK

348
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
IMMEDIATELY IF THERE IS NO DEAL

349
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
IN WASHINGTON?

350
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
THAT'S NEXT.

351
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Bring it down, please?

352
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Better. That's what happens to
background noise,

353
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
when you're making
a call on this.

354
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This microphone here, picks up
the sounds around you and helps
turn them down.

355
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So when the world gets noisy

356
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Calls sound better.

357
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
...so as you can see, GEICO's
customer satisfaction is at 97%.

358
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Mmmm tasty.

359
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And cut! Very good.

360
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

361
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

362
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

363
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's not real.

364
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

365
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

366
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

367
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

368

00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
BEAST CONTRIBUTOR AND EDITOR IN

912
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
CHIEF OF THE DAILY DOWNLOAD.COM

913
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

914
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
IT'S JUST A MOVIE.

915
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
WHY ARE PEOPLE GOING COMPLETELY

916
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
NUTS ABOUT THIS?

917
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
>> IT'S JUST A MOVIE.

918
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
THE WOMAN IN THE CENTER OF IT,

919
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
THE CIA OPERATIVE, WAS TRASHED

920
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
ON THE FRONT PAGE OF "THE

921
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
WASHINGTON POST" NASAID AS BEIN

922
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
ABRASIVE, A PASSED OVER FOR

923
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
PROMOTI

924
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
PROMOTION.
>> IT'S A DOCK YOU DRAMA IT'S A

925
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
MOVIE.

926
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
>> THIS REAL PERSON IS NOT ABLE

927
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
TO DEFEND HERSELF.

928
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
>> BUT THERE IS A BIG QUESTION

929
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
WHETHER OR NOT THE CIA ACTUALLY

930
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
GAVE THEM ALL OF THIS

931
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
INFORMATION, ALL OF THIS ACCESS.

932
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
THE WHITE HOUSE GAVE HER ACCESS.

933
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS.

934
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
>> SHE KNOWS WHO SHE IS.

935
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, SHE COULD HAVE

936
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
HER FRIENDS LEAK STUFF BACK THIS

937
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
IS HOW THE PRESS WORKS.

938
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
SHE COULD HAVE HER FRIENDS LEAK

939
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
STUFF BACK.
IT WOULD BE FINE, WORK IT OUT.

940
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
>> TORTURE, A HALF AN HOUR OF

941
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
TORTURE SCENES IN HERE.

942
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
>> AND I'M SURE THAT'S BECAUSE

943
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
THEY WANT TO TELL THE STORY IN

944
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
THE MOST ACCURATE HISTORICAL

945
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
CONTEXT, RIGHT?
>> I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ACCURATE

946
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
OR HISTORICAL, IT'S A DOCUDRAMA.

947
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
>> IT'S FUN TO WATCH YOU FIGHT.

948
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
BUT SERIOUSLY, IS THERE A

949
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
REQUIREMENT -- YOU'VE DONE

950
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
MOVIES OBVIOUSLY.

951
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
IS THERE A REQUIREMENT THAT A

952
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
MOVIE ABOUT WAR HAS TO BE

953
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
ACCURATE.
THERE HAVE BEEN A TON OF MOVIES

954
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
AROUND A REAL TOPIC.

955
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
A REAL EXPERIENCE THAT HAVE

956
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
BEEN, YOU KNOW, TAKEN POETIC

957
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
LICENSE ON CERTAIN THINGS.

958
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
>> I HAVE NEVER MADE A FICTIONAL

959
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
MOVIE.
BUT IN A FICTIONAL MOVIE YOU CAN

960
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT AS LONG AS

961
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
YOU DON'T CALL IT A DOCUMENTARY.

962
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
THAT SAID, I THINK THE TORTURE

963
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
ISSUE GOES TO THE BROADER ISSUE

964
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
OF WHY WE'RE IN AFGHANISTAN, IN

965
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
A SENSE.

966
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'VE HAD THIS ARGUMENT WITH

967
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
PEOPLE.
AND VERY HAPPY WITH BIN LADEN

968
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
WAS KILLED.

969
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
AND THE POINT I MAKE, NO WAY WE

970
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
COULD HAVE KILLED BIN LADEN

971
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
WITHOUT BEING IN AFGHANISTAN,

972
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
AND YOU WON'T FLY S.E.A.L. TEAM

973
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
6 FROM VIRGINIA AND KILL HIM.

974
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
YOU DON'T GET THE INTEL AND

975
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
FORWARD OPERATING BASES.

976
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
WE HAD TO BE IN AFGHANISTAN TO

977
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
DO THAT.

978
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
THE MORAL QUESTION FOR AMERICA,

979
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
THAT WAS A CORRECT DECISION TO

980
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
BE AT WAR IN ORDER TO KILL THAT

981
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
PERSON?
THE FINER POINT, CAN YOU TORTURE

982
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
IN ORDER TO KILL SOMEONE YOU

983
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
NEED TO GET?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS.

984
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
>> THE FILMMAKER AND CATHLIN BIG

985
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
LOW ARE PRESENTING THIS AS A

986
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
JOURNALISTIC ENTERPRISE.

987
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
THEY ARE NOT CALLING IT A

988
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
DOCUDRAMA.

989
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
THEY GOT AN UNUSUAL DEGREE OF

990
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
ACCESS TO CIA, WHITE HOUSE,

991
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
WHICH WANTED TO SPIN THIS TO A

992
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
POSITIVE MOVIE OF OBAMA.

993
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
>> THE POSITIVE PIECE IN THE

994
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
CENTER, THE WOMAN GETTING THE

995
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
CREDIT FOR GETTING BIN LADEN

996
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
KILLED.
>> WHY IS THERE A WOMAN AT THE

997
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
CENTER OF THIS MOVIE?

998
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
>> IS IT MORE INTERESTING?

999
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
>> WASN'T THERE A WOMAN AT THE

1000
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
CENTER OF THE STORY?

1001
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
BASED ON A REAL CHARACTER,

1002
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
RIGHT?

1003
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
>> PART OF A TEAM.

1004
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
AND I THINK SHE'S A HEROINE, AND

1005
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
THAT'S WHY I COME BACK TO THE

1006
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
NOTION SHE IS BEING TRASHED AND

1007
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
SHE SHOULD BE GETTING A MEDAL.

1008
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN "ZERO DARK

1009
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
THIRTY."
CAN YOU SEPARATE TORTURE FROM

1010
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
BIN LADEN?

1011
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
HOW DOES THE MOVIE TREAT THAT

1012
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
CONNECTION?
>> BASED ON CRITIC WHO'S HAVE

1013
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
SEEN IT, THEY ARE SAYING THERE

1014
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
IS A CLEAR IMPLICATION WE WOULD

1015
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
HAVE NOT GOTTEN BIN LADEN IF --

1016
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
>> TORTURE SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED,

1017
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
SOFTENED UP THE CHARACTER, THE

1018
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
PERSON WHO EVENTUALLY GAVE

1019
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
INFORMATION.

1020
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
>> INVESTIGATORS ARE NOT

1021
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
CONVINCED WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN

1022
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
BIN LADEN.
>> YOU CAN'T SAY A MOVIE LIKE

1023
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
ARGO, WHICH GOES OFTEN

1024
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
DECLASSIFIED INFORMATION, DOES

1025
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
NOT AT SOME POINT TAKE LICENSE

1026
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
AND CREATE DRAMA IN CERTAIN
SCENES THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.

1027
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

1028
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
MISSISSIPPI BURNING CREATED

1029
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
ENTIRE CHARACTERS AROUND A REAL

1030
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
EVENT.
>> I THING ABOUT IT THE WOMAN

1031
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
WHO GETS HIGHLIGHTED AT THE

1032
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
CENTER, PEOPLE AT THE AGENCY WHO

1033
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT ARE

1034
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
NOW STARTING THIS WHOLE TRASH

1035
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
TALK, SHE'S THIS, SHE'S THAT.

1036
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
>> YOU CAN SAY IT'S JUST A

1037
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
MOVIE, BUT MOVIES LIKE THIS, IT

1038
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
LOOKS LIKE A BIG BOX OFFICE

1039
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
MOVIE SHAPE PERCEPTION FOR A LOT

1040
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T FOLLOW

1041
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
STORIES THAT CLOSELY.
>> THAT'S THEIR FAULT.

1042
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
GO READ A NEWSPAPER.

1043
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
DON'T RELY ON MOVIES AS YOUR

1044
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
SOURCE OF NEWS.
>> DON'T YOU THINK ORGANIZATIONS

1045
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
LIKE THE CIA HAVE DECIDED IT'S

1046
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS TO PUT

1047
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
STORYLINES OUT THERE LIKE THIS.

1048
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
>> I DON'T HAVE TO GUESS AT

1049
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
THIS.
A WHOLE BUNCH OF E-MAIL TRAFFIC

1050
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
THAT SHOWS CIA OPERATIVES SAYING

1051
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
WE NEED TO PICK A WINNER.

1052
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
THIS WILL BE BIG, WE NEED TO

1053
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
COOPERATE.

1054
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
>> IF YOU WERE IN THE WHITE
HOUSE, WOULDN'T YOU DO THIS?

1055
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
COOPERATE AND SAY HERE IS THE

1056
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
REAL SIDE OF THE STORY?

1057
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
>> THE PROBLEM, WHAT ARE THE

1058
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
MESSAGES?

1059
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
WHAT MESSAGE IS IT TRYING TO

1060
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
SEND?

1061
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
THE MESSAGE TORTURE WORKS?

1062
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
EVERYBODY COULD SEE, IF YOU

1063
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
TORTURE SOMEBODY THEY WILL --

1064
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
>> WHERE DOES IT LEAVE YOU?

1065
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
WHERE DOES IT LEAVE YOU IF WE

1066
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
ARE A COUNTRY THAT TORTURES

1067
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
PEOPLE.
>> DO WHAT SEBASTIAN DOES, WRITE

1068
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
NONFICTION, THE MESSAGE IS ONLY

1069
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
TRUTH.
WHEN YOU VENTURE INTO FICTION

1070
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
AND OPEN TO CRITICISM.

1071
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL US?

1072
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
>> LIKE PO

1073
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
>> HE SAYS HE WANTS IT TO BE

1074
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
JUDGED AS A MOVIE, IT'S NOT A

1075
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
DOCUMENTARY.
IT'S A MOVIE, NOT A DOCUMENTARY.

1076
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
>>> WE HAVE TO TAKE A SHORT

1077
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
BREAK.
STILL AHEAD, WE'LL TALK ABOUT

1078
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE, TAKEN

1079
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
HERSELF OUT OF THE RUNNING FOR

1080
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
SECRETARY OF STATE.

1081
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
DOES THAT MEAN THAT SENATOR JOHN

1082
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
KERRY IS A SHOO-IN?

1083
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
A POSSIBLE CANDIDATE FROM ACROSS

1084
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
THE AISLE.
TALK ABOUT THAT, NEXT.

1085
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
JAYMI'S CHRISTMAS SHOPPING
AND WAS LOOKING FOR
GIFTS AT BEST BUY.

1086
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
YOU WANNA SEE IF WALMART HAS
SIMILAR GIFTS FOR LESS?

1087
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
YEAH.
LET'S GO.
SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 --

1088
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
OVER FIFTY DOLLARS LESS
THAN BEST BUY!

1089
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000

1528
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000

1543
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000

>> SENATES LOTT AND DASCHLE,

1555
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
THEY WORKED ON MANY ISSUES

1556
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
TOGETHER AND THEY STILL THINK

1557
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET A

1558
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
DEAL, IT JUST HAS TO DO WITH THE

1559
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
TIMING.
LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAID.

1560
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
>> I STILL AM CONVINCED AND

1561
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
HOPEFUL AT LEAST THAT THEY'RE

1562
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
GOING TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT.

1563
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT YOU

1564
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT TOO EARLY

1565
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
BECAUSE THAT GIVES PEOPLE THAT

1566
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
MAY NOT BE TOO HAPPY WITH IT

1567
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
MORE TIME TO UNDERMINE IT SO THE

1568
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
TEMPO AND THE TIMING IS

1569
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
IMPORTANT.

1570
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
>> I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY IN THE

1571
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, REPUBLICANS

1572
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
AND DEMOCRATS SAID THE TIME HAS

1573
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
COME FOR US TO PUT OUR COUNTRY

1574
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
AHEAD OF OUR PARTY, AND THAT'S

1575
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
REALLY WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE,

1576
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000

1579
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN,

1580
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
ABOUT A DECADE AGO, IS BOTH

1581
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000

1583
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
NOT JUST ABOUT GENERAL VOTERS

1584
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
BUT ABOUT GETTING PRIMARY FROM

1585
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
WITHIN THEIR OWN PARTY AND THAT

1586
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
IS WHY IT IS SO MUCH MORE

1587
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
DIFFICULT TO GET A DEAL.

1623
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
ON THERE, OTHER THAN WASHINGTON

1624
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
SEEMS TO BE AT IT'S GAMES AGAIN

1625
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
LIKE IT PLAYED BEFORE THE

1626
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
ELECTION.

1627
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
ONLY THE PRESIDENT HAS THE BULLY

1628
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
PULPIT.
WHILE I GENERALLY AGREE WITH THE

1629
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
CONCEPTS HE'S PUT FORWARD,

1630
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
SUBSTANTIVELY I THINK HE'S THE

1631
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
ONLY PERSON WHO CAN TALK TO THE

1632
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE, PAINT A PICTURE

1633
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
AND CREATE A NARRATIVE WHY WE'RE

1634
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
GOING THROUGH ALL THIS, TOTALLY

1635
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
ABSENT FROM THIS DISCUSSION.

1636
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
MOST AMERICANS THINK IT'S A

1637
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
TRIBAL BATTLE IN WASHINGTON NOT

1638
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
AFFECTING THEIR LIVES IN ANY

1639
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
WAY.

1640
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
>> PAINTING A PICTURE AND WHAT

1641
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
YOU WROTE THE SPECIFICS ARE LESS

1642
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
IMPORTANT THAN THE BIG PICTURE

1643
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
RATIONALE AND ONE OF THE BIG

1644
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
POINTS OF CONTENTION IS LACK OF

1645
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
SPECIFICS.
WHAT ARE WE ACTUALLY THINKING

1646
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
ABOUT CUTTING, EXACTLY WHAT WILL

1647
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
THE TAX RATE BE, THINGS LIKE

1648
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
THAT, I THINK PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE

1649
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
THAT SPECIFICS, LACK OF SPERVEGS

1650
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
HAS BEEN A BIG PROBLEM IN THIS

1651
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
DEBATE.
>> THAT'S A QUESTION OF

1652
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
LEADERSHIP AND BOTH THE

1653
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
PRESIDENT AND THE CONGRESS HAVE

1654
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
TO COME UP WITH THOSE SPECIFICS.

1655
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I'M REMINDED OF THE KENNEDY

1656
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
ADDRESS, JOHN KENNEDY, ASK WHAT

1657
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR COUNTRY.

1658
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
SOMEBODY HAS TO ASK THE AMERICAN

1659
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
PEOPLE, THE WEALTHY AND OTHERS

1660
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
AS WELL, THE WHOLE SOCIETY

1661
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
WHETHER THEY'RE WILLING TO

1662
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
SACRIFICE FOR THE GOOD OF THE

1663
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
COUNTRY TO MAINTAIN AMERICA'S

1664
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
STRENGTH IN ITS ECONOMY AROUND

1665
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
THE WORLD.

1666
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
NOBODY'S DONE THAT YET, AND

1667
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
WE'VE SEEN PROPOSALS LIKE THE

1668
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
SIMPSON-BOWLES PROPOSAL OR

1669
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
DOMENICI PRF RI

1670
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
DOMENICI-RIVLIN.

1671
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I THINK SOMEBODY HAS TO ASK THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE, HERE ARE THE

1672
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
FACTS, HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS IF

1673
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
WE DON'T DO ANYTHING, THAT'S NOT

1674
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
GOOD FOR AMERICA AND REPUBLICANS

1675
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
AND DEMOCRATS AND HAS TO BRING

1676
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE INTO THE

1677
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
DEBATE.
SO FAR THIS HAS BEEN AN INSIDE

1678
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
WASHINGTON DEBATE.

1679
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
>> HI, CONGRESSMAN, IT'S RICHARD

1680
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
SOCARIDES.

1681
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I THINK IF WE ALL THINK ABOUT

1682
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
THE SPEECH THAT BILL CLINTON

1683
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
GAVE AT THE DEMOCRATIC

1684
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
CONVENTI

1685
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
CONVENTION, IF BARACK OBAMA

1686
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
COULD GO BEFORE CONGRESS AND

1687
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
GIVE THAT KIND OF A SPEECH NOW I

1688
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
THINK IT WOULD REALLY HELP HIM

1689
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
AND THE DEMOCRATS WIN THE DAY IN

1690
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
THESE NEGOTIATIONS AND I THINK

1691
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING YOU

1692
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
WERE SUGGESTING, RIGHT?

1693
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
>> IT IS BUT I THINK HE HAS TO

1694
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
BE CAREFUL NOT TO GIVE A

1695
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
PARTISAN SPEECH.

1696
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
THIS IS A BIGGER SPEECH THAN

1697
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
THIS.
THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE FUTURE

1698
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
OF THE REPUBLIC.

1699
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
AFTER ALL IF WE CAN'T EVEN ADD

1700
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
OR SUBTRACT TOWER DEFICIT INTO

1701
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
SOME REASONABLE WAY SO THE

1702
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SOME

1703
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
PREDICTABILITY AND FISCAL SANITY

1704
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
NOTHING IS GOING TO WORK.

1705
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN

1706
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
ARTICULATE THIS TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE IN

1707
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
A WAY THAT'S NOT ENGAGED IN

1708
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
POLITICAL GAMESMANSHIP.

1709
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
>> I'M NOT A CYNIC.

1710
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
SOMETIMES I AM BUT TODAY NOT

1711
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
PARTICULARLY.
I DON'T SEE HOW A SPEECH SOMEHOW

1712
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
BRINGS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO

1713
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
FEEL DISCONNECTED WITH A FISCAL

1714
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
CLIFF DISCUSSION.
WHAT COULD I DO?

1715
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
YOU DO A VERY MOVING, SAY AN

1716
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
AMAZING SPEECH, MOVING, I LAUGH,

1717
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I CRY, I MOVE, TO DO WHAT?

1718
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
>> THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT A

1719
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
MYSTERY.

1720
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
THESE ARE THE SAME LINES FROM

1721
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
THE SAME PEOPLE WE'VE BEEN

1722
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
HEARING FOR 14 MONTHS.

1723
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW SPEAKING

1724
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
TO THEM IN FRONT OF A DIFFERENT

1725
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
GROUP OF PEOPLE MAKES ANY

1726
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
DIFFERENCE.

1727
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
>> I'D LOVE TO THROW TO DAN, I'M

1728
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
NOT SURE OF THE PRESIDENT'S

1729
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
DESIRE TO DO WHAT YOU DESCRIBE.

1730
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
WHICH IS TO MIX UP THE FISCAL

1731
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
CLIFF AND OUR LONG-TERM DEBT

1732
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
SITUATION.

1733
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I'VE SEEN NO DESIRE COMING FROM

1734
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
THE WHITE HOUSE TO DEAL WITH

1735
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
BOTH ISSUES AT THE SAME TIME.

1736
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:50,000
>> FIRST OF ALL I RECOGNIZE IT'S

1737
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
MAYBE RATHER LATE TO DO A SPEECH
TODAY.

1738
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
THE PRESIDENT JUST CAN'T DO A

1739
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
SPEECH WITHOUT GETTING THE

1740
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
SPEAKER'S PERMISSION TO DO THAT

1741
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
KIND OF THING BUT IF YOU LOOK AT

1742
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
THE ISSUE BIGGER THAN JUST WHAT

1743
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
THE TAX RATES ARE GOING TO BE OR

1744
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
WHAT THE ENTITLEMENT CUTS ARE

1745
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
GOING TO BE, THIS HAS TO DO WITH

1746
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
THE FISCAL STABILITY AND

1747
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
STRENGTH OF AMERICA, TO BE THE

1748
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
LEADER IN THE WORLD.

1749
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
THESE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES,

1750
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
SOMEBODY HAS TO ARTICULATE THE

1751
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
SIGNIFICANCE WHAT HAVE WE'RE

1752
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000

PEOPLE SO THEY UNDERSTAND IT,

1754
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
AND IT HAS TO BE DONE IN A

1755
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
NONPOLITICAL, NONPARTISAN WAY.

1756
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000

CONTIRMCO

1803
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
CONFIRMATION PROCESS THAT WAS
PROLONGED, POLITICIZED, VERY

1804
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
DISTRACTING AND VERY DISRIPPIVE

1805
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS

1806
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
WE NEED TO GET DONE AS A

1807

CRITICIZED BY SENATE REPUBLICANS

1809

SHE ORIGINALLY SAID THE VIOLENCE

STARTED OVER ANGER ABOUT THAT

1815
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000

MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION SAY

1822
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
THE DISCUSSION IS TOO ISLAMIST

1823
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
AND INFRINGES ON MINORITY

1824
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
RIGHTS, THEY'RE APPARENTLY

1825
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000

OF THE BASKETBALL GAME, 107-2,

OF YOUNG WOMEN WHO NEVER PLAYED

1858

ON A VARSITY TEAM.

1859
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
THE SIGN WAS REALLY AN

1860
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
INDICATION OF BAD SPORTSMANSHIP.

1861
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
TEAM MEMBERS JOIN US ALONG WITH

1862
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000

01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
AFTER WHAT NOT ONLY WAS IT A

1869
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
DEVASTATING LOSS, EVERYBODY WAS

1870
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
TALKING ABOUT IT, IT MADE

1871
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
HEADLINES ALL OVER THE PLACE.

1872
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
HOW ARE YOU GUYS FEELING ABOUT

1873
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
THAT?

1874
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
>> WELL, WE WERE, WE WEREN'T

1875
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
SHOCKED THE NEXT MORNING BUT

1876
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
THEN AGAIN WE WERE IN SHOCK.

1877
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
IT'S A HUMBLING EXPERIENCE AND

1878
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE

1879
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
BLESSED BECAUSE WE HAVE ONE

1880
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
ANOTHER AND WE JUST GO BACK TO

1881
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
THE GRIND ON THE BASKETBALL

1882
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
COURT THE NEXT MORNING, SO IT

1883
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
WAS SHOCKING NEWS BUT WE GOT

1884
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
OVER IT AND WE JUST ARE BACK ON

1885
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
THE GROUND ON THE BASKETBALL

1886
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
COURT.
>> BRIOLETTE YOU'RE A FRESHMAN

1887
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
AT ARLINGTON.

1888
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
HAVE YOU PLAYED BASKETBALL

1889
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
BEFORE?
WHAT WENT WRONG THAT THE SCORE

1890
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
WAS SO LOPSIDED?

1891
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
>> YES, I'VE PLAYED BASKETBALL

1892
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
BEFORE AND I THINK WHAT WENT

1893
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
WRONG WAS THAT WE JUST, IT WAS A

1894
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
STRUGGLE BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY

1895
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
ON THE TEAM HAS PLAYED BEFORE

1896
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
AND THIS WAS A VARSITY GAME, AND

1897
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
IT WAS MORE COMPETITIVE BECAUSE

1898
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
THEY'VE PLAYED LONGER THAN MOST

1899
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
OF US AND THEY JUST WORK, THEY

1900
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
WORK VERY HARD AND WE JUST

1901
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
HAVEN'T PLAYED BEFORE AND IT WAS

1902
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
PROBABLY REALLY HARD FOR ALL OF

1903
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
US AS A TEAM.

1904
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
>> COACH, LET ME ASK YOU A

1905
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
QUESTION SOME OF THE FALLOUT

1906
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
PEOPLE WERE SAYING THERE SHOULD

1907
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
HAVE BEEN A MERCY RULE MEANING

1908
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
THEY SHOULD HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW

1909
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
TO AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF

1910
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
POINTS WERE SCORED PLAYED THE

1911
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
GAME DIFFERENTLY, MAYBE THE

1912
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
OPPOSING TEAM STOP SHOOTING ON

1913
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
YOU, MAYBE STOP THE GAME,

1914
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
WHATEVER.

1915
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
SORT OF VARIOUS VERSIONS OF WHAT

1916
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

1917
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
LETTING THE GAME GO ON SO LONG

1918
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
THAT WAS REALLY BAD

1919
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
SPORTSMANSHIP.
DO YOU SEE IT THAT WAY FROM THE

1920
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
OPPOSING TEAM?

1921
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
>> NO, I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

1922
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I WAS ASKED ABOUT THE MERCY RULE

1923
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
AND I DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE

1924
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
MERCY RULE.

1925
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I JUST BELIEVE IN CHARACTER AND

1926
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
THIS IS THE GAME OF BASKETBALL,

1927
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
AND I BELIEVE THAT ALL RULES AND

1928
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
REGULATIONS SHOULD STAY THE

1929
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
SAME, BUT I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

1930
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,000
A TIME FOR THE OPPOSING TEAM OR

1931
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
OURSELVES, WHICHEVER WAY THE

1932
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
GAME IS GOING IF IT'S A LOPSIDED

1933
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
SCORE THAT THE TEAM WORKS ON

1934
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
SOMETHING THEY'VE NEVER WORKED

1935
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
ON BEFORE AND THEREFORE THAT

1936
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
WILL MILK TIME OFF THE CLOCK

1937
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
EVENTUALLY AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO

1938
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
GO THROUGH THE NURTURING PHASE

1939
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
AS I HAVE BEEN WITH MY GIRLS BUT

1940
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
NONETHELESS IT'S BEEN A

1941
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
BLESSING.

1942
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
>> SO I HAVE A QUESTION.

1943
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
WHO SCORED THE TWO POINTS THAT

1944
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,000
YOU GOT?

1945
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
>> RIGHT HERE, FREE-THROWS.

1946
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
>> THAT'S YOUR HERO.

1947
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
>> AND YOU BUILT FROM THERE.

1948
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
>> THAT WAS IT.

1949
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
YOU GUYS HAVE LOST 23 GAMES.

1950
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
YOU'VE REALLY HAD A TOUGH TIME

1951
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
AND THE SCHOOL WAS TAKEN OVER

1952
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
BECAUSE OF SOME ACADEMIC ISSUES

1953
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
SO THERE'S A LEVEL, EVERYBODY

1954
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
HAS TO HAVE A C GRADE POINT

1955
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
AVERAGE ON THE TEAM OR THEY'RE

1956
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
NOT ALLOWED TO PLAY.

1957
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR YOU.

1958
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
MIKE EPPS THE ACTOR CAME IN,

1959
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
GAVE A TALK TO THE TEAM AND SAID

1960
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
LISTEN THERE'S A LOT OF GROWTH

1961
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
THAT CAN BE HAD BASICALLY IN

1962
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
LOSING, WHEN YOU LOSE, YOU CAN

1963
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
COME BACK FROM THAT IN A BIG

1964
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
WAY.
WHAT'S THE STRATEGY COACH NOW

1965
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
AND HOW ARE YOU BRINGING YOUR

1966
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
GIRLS ALONG, YOUR YOUNG LADIES

1967
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,000
ALONG FOR THE NEXT GAMES?

1968
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
>> WELL, EVER SINCE THE GAME HAD

1969
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
ENDED AND ALL THIS HAS COME

1970
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
ABOUT, OUR MINDS HAVE NOT

1971
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
CHANGED.

1972
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
THEY ARE THE SAME AS IF THIS WAS

1973
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
THE FIRST GAME OF THE SEASON,

1974
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
JUST STAYING HUMBLE, WORKING

1975
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
HARD, CONTINUOUS EFFORT EVERY

1976
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
SINGLE DAY AND KEEPING A SMILE

1977
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
ON OUR FACE AND BASICALLY STILL

1978
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
GETTING AFTER IT IN THE

1979
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
CLASSROOM FIRST AND WE JUST

1980
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
HAVEN'T CHANGED WHO WE ARE AND

1981

HAPPENED IN THE PARKING LOT?

2292

BECAUSE THAT'S OUR ONLY CHILD,

2316

THE ONLY CHILD WE WERE GOING TO

2317
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000

01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
NOW SWAPPED ATTORNEYS SAID THEY

2334
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
MIGHT FOCUS ON THE STAND YOUR
GROUND LAW AND MR. PHILLIPS YOU

2335
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
CAN JUMP IN IF YOU FEEL LIKE

2336
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
THIS IS A QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO

2337
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
GO TO YOU.

2338
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
HERE IS WHAT THE FIRST ATTORNEY

2339
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
HAS SAID ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

2340
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
THAT NIGHT.

2341
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:57,000
LET'S PLAY THAT.

2342
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
>> KILL THAT MOTHER [ BLEEP ],

2343
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
YOU DEAD [ BLEEP ], AND HE SEES

2344
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
THAT MUCH OF A SHOTGUN COMING UP

2345
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
OVER THE RIM OF THE SUV, WHICH

2346
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
IS UP HIGHER THAN HIS JETTA AND

2347
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
ALL HE SEES ARE HEAVILY TINTED

2348
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
FRONT WINDOWS THAT ARE UP, AND

2349
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
THE BACK WINDOWS THAT ARE DOWN

2350
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
AND THE CAR HAS AT LEAST FOUR

2351
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
BLACK MEN IN IT, AND HE DOESN'T

2352
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
KNOW HOW OLD ANYBODY IS, HE

2353
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING, BUT HE

2354
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
KNOWS A SHOTGUN WHEN HE SEES

2355
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
ONE.
>> SO THAT'S HER EXPLANATION OF

2356
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
WHAT HAPPENED.

2357
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
IS THIS CASE ABOUT RACE?

2358
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
IS THIS CASE ABOUT LOUD MUSIC?

2359
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
WHAT IS THIS CASE REALLY ABOUT,

2360
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
DO YOU THINK?
>> IT'S ABOUT LOUD MUSIC AND

2361
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
IT'S ALSO ABOUT ANGER, ABOUT

2362
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
HAVING A CONCEALED WEAPON IN

2363
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
YOUR CAR, KNOWING YOU HAVE IT

2364
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
AND FEEL BOLD ENOUGH TO USE IT

2365
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
BECAUSE YOU'RE BEING SHIELDED IN

2366
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
THE STATE OF FLORIDA, THEY TELL

2367
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
YOU IF YOU HAVE A CONCEALED

2368
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
WEAPON THESE ARE SOME OF THE

2369
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
THINGS YOU CAN DO IF YOU FEEL

2370
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
YOU'RE THREATENED IN ANY WAY,

2371
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
THEN YOU ARE ALLOWED TO USE YOUR

2372
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
WEAPON, SO HE WAS ANGRY, AND HE

2373
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
HEARD LOUD MUSIC, OF COURSE YOU

2374
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
GOT 17-YEAR-OLDS, THEY DON'T DO

2375
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
WHAT YOU SAY IF YOU'RE IN A

2376
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
PUBLIC PLACE.
YOU'RE NOT THEIR PARENT AND HE

2377
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
DECIDED THAT, WELL, YOU KNOW

2378
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
WHAT?
IF YOU DON'T TURN THE MUSIC DOWN

2379
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I'M GOING TO TAKE MY WEAPON OUT

2380
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
AND SHOOT AT THE CAR AT LEAST

2381
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
EIGHT TIMES AT THE CAR IN A GAS

2382
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
STATION.
>> THE STAND YOUR GROUND LAW

2383
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
SAYS YOU'RE JUSTIFIED TO USE

2384
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
DEADLY FORCE IF YOU REASONABLY

2385
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
BELIEVE THAT SUCH FORCE IS

2386
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,000
NECESSARY TO PREVENT EMINENT

2387
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
DEATH OR GREAT BODILY HARM TO

2388
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
YOURSELF.
YOU WERE GOING TO SAY?

2389
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
>> IF IT IS ABOUT RACE FOR MR.

2390
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
DUNN HE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT

2391
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
KNOWS THAT.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE THAT,

2392
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T JUSTIFY

2393
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED FOR

2394
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
JORDAN, IT DOESN'T JUSTIFY

2395
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED FOR

2396
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
TRAYVON MARTIN, IT DOESN'T

2397
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
JUSTIFY ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS

2398
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
FOR ANYONE ELSE THAT FALLS

2399
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
VICTIM UNDER THIS LAW.

2400
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
IT JUST DOESN'T.

2401
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
SO HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO

2402
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
UNDERSTANDS AND KNOWS WHERE HE

2403
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
WAS AND WHAT WAS IN HIS HEART AT

2404
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
THAT TIME, AND HE HAS TO DEAL

2405
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
WITH THAT.

2406
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
>> DID YOU WORRY ABOUT JORDAN

2407
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
WHEN THE TRAYVON MARTIN CASE

2408
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
HAPPENED?

2409
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I'VE HAD SO MANY PARENTS SAY TO

2410
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
ME --

2411
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> OH MY GOD THAT COULD HAVE

2412
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
BEEN MY KID.

2413
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
>> ABSOLUTELY, YOU THINK ABOUT

2414
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
THAT ALL THE TIME.

2415
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
AS WE'VE SAID BEFORE WHEN YOUR

2416
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,000
CHILDREN GROW UP AND GO ON, YOU

2417
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
HAVE TO GIVE THEM A FREEDOM,

2418
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
CHANCE AND OPPORTUNITY TO BE WHO

2419
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
THEY ARE AND THEY MAKE FRIEND

2420
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
AND DO THINGS, THERE'S ALWAYS

2421
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
THE UNDERCURRENT, ALWAYS A

2422
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
LITTLE BIT OF THAT FEAR THAT

2423
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
YOU'RE CONCERNED BECAUSE YOU

2424
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
CAN'T BE THERE WITH THEM, YOU

2425
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
CAN'T HOLD THEIR HAND ANYMORE.

2426
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
YOU'VE TRAINED THEM AND YOU'VE

2427
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
DONE EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO

2428
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
BUT THEY DO HAVE TO GO OUT IN

2429
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
THE WORLD.
YOU DO YOUR BEST THAT YOU CAN TO

2430
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
PROTECT THEM.
>> SOLEDAD I'D LIKE TO REALLY

2431
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
SAY THAT I JUST WANT THE

2432
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
COMMUNITY AND THE WORLD, AMERICA

2433
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
TO KNOW THAT WHEN YOU ALLOW

2434
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
PEOPLE UNDER THIS SHIELD STAND

2435
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
YOUR GROUND YOU'RE PUTTING IN

2436
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
JEOPARDY YOUR KIDS THAT HAVE

2437
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TWO

2438
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
PEOPLE THAT ARE FACING EACH

2439
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
OTHER.
YOU HAVE PEOPLE, THE KIDS ARE

2440
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
PLAYING HOP SCOTCH, KIDS ARE

2441
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
JUMPING ROPE, RIDING BIKES, YOUR

2442
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
NEPHEW, YOUR NIECE AND TWO

2443
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
PEOPLE DECIDE TO DRAW DOWN ON

2444
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
EACH OTHER, THEY'RE GOING TO HIT

2445
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
ANYTHING THAT'S IN THE WAY, SO

2446
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
AMERICA HAS TO KNOW THAT IT'S

2447
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
NOT JUST THE TWO PEOPLE

2448
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
INVOLVED, IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT

2449
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

2450
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
10-YEAR-OLD KID, THE 10-YEAR-OLD

2451
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
GIRL, SOMEBODY'S NIECE,

2452
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER, THAT
HAPPENED TO BE PLAYING NEAR THE

2453
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
TWO PEOPLE THAT DECIDED TO DRAW

2454
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
ON EACH OTHER.
>> IT'S UNCLEAR IF HE'S GOING TO

2455
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
IN FACT USE THE STAND YOUR

2456
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
GROUND LAW.

2457
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
THE SECOND ATTORNEY THAT HAS

2458
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
COME IN HAS NOT INDICATED THAT

2459
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
EITHER WAY BUT WHAT WOULD YOU

2460
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
LIKE TO SEE FOR HIM?

2461
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
>> THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE

2462
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
STAND YOUR GROUND LAW, BASED

2463
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
UPON A REASONABLE PERSON'S

2464
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
STANDARD AND THE ONLY WITNESS TO

2465
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,000
THE REASONABLE PERSON WHETHER

2466
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
THAT PERSON WAS BEING REASONABLE

2467
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
WAS NOW KILLED IN EVERY ONE OF

2468
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
THESE CASES AND THAT'S A MAJOR

2469
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
PROBLEM.

2470
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
>> WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE

2471
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,000
HAPPEN?

2472
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
MR. DUNN GOES TO COURT ON

2473
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
MONDAY, ARRAIGNMENT.

2474
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
>> WE HAVE ACTUALLY ALREADY

2475
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
BEGUN TO FIGHT AGAINST THE STAND

2476
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
YOUR GROUND LAWS.

2477
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:53,000
WE'VE STARTED

2478
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
WWW.WALKWITHJORDAN.COM AND ON

2479
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
THAT SITE, YOU CAN GO AND SIGN

2480
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,000
THE FEDERAL PETITION TO GO TO

2481
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
WASHINGTON, WE'RE GOING TO

2482
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
WASHINGTON TO MAKE AMENDS TO THE

2483
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
FEDERAL STAND YOUR GROUND LAWS.

2484
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
WE HAVE TO DO IT FEDERALLY

2485
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
BECAUSE THAT MANDATES ALL THE

2486
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
STATES TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS,

2487
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
NOT JUST THE STATE OF FLORIDA.

2488
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:17,000
SO WE'VE ALREADY BEGUN THAT

2489
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
WALK, WAL

2490
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000

2494
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
>> THANK YOU FOR TALKING WITH US

2495
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
THIS MORNING.

2496
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I KNOW THIS IS A TERRIBLE,

2497
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
HORRIFIC THING TO HAVE TO

2498
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
DISCUSS AND SOMETHING I'M SURE

2499
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
AS A PARENT YOU CAN'T EVEN

2500
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
IMAGINE.
>> YES, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

2501
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,000
>> LUCIA McBATH, THANK YOU.

2502
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
WE HAVE TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK

2503
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
THIS MORNING.

2504
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
AHEAD WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

2505
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
A YOUNG JOURNALIST WHO VENTURES

2506
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
INTO WAR TORN AFRICA AND PUTS

2507
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
HIS LIFE ON THE LINE TO GET THE

2508
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
TRUTH, THE NEW BOOK CALLED "A

2509
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
WORLD MADE OF BLOOD" IT'S

2510
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000

2714
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
DID A PHENOMENAL JOB AND TALKING

2715
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
TO HIM, HE CONVINCED ME THAT HE

2716
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
WAS GOING TO DO A GOOD JOB AND

2717
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,000
INDEED HE DID.

SURROUNDED HIMSELF THE ENTIRE

MOVIE, PEOPLE FUNDING IT AND

2720
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
HELPING OUT ON IT WERE ALL

2721
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
VETERANS.

2722
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
WHAT KIND OF EXPERTISE DO YOU

2723
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
THINK THEY BROUGHT TO MAKE IT

2724
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
BETTER AND MORE REALISTIC?

2725
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000

KNOW, THEY DO GREAT WORK, THEY

2729
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
WERE TRAINED BY NAVY S.E.A.L.s

2730

AND PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE

2731

MILITARY, WE HAD MILITARY ALWAYS

2732
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
THERE, SO THEY JUST MADE SURE

2733
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
THEY KEPT IT REAL.

2734
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
>> IS IT A TRUE STORY?

2735
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
>> I THINK IT'S BASED ON SOME OF

2736
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO THE

2737
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
DIRECTOR.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF IT IS

2738
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
ACTUALLY TRUE, BUT IT'S BASED ON

2739
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,000
A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO

2740
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
MIKE CONNORS, THE DIRECTOR.

2741
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
>> IT'S THE STORY OF ALLEGIANCE,

2742
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,000
WHEN A FELLOW SOLDIER HAS TO GO

2743
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
AWOL BECAUSE HE'S TRYING TO SEE

2744
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
HIS SON WHO IS DYING AND OF

2745
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
COURSE HE'S A PART-TIME SOLDIER

2746
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
WHO NOW SUDDENLY HAS BECOME A

2747
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
FULL TIME SOLDIER IN ANOTHER

2748
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
COUNTRY.
I WANT TO SHOW A LITTLE CLIP OF

2749
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:21,000
THAT.

2750
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
>> DO YOU HONESTLY THINK I WANT

2751
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
TO LET YOU WALK OUT OF HERE

2752
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,000
WITHOUT EVEN A SLAP ON THE

2753
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:31,000
WRIST?
HELL NO!

2754
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
BUT THESE ARE THE DECISIONS I

2755
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
HAVE TO MAKE FOR THE GOOD OF THE

2756
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
UNIT.

2757
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,000
FOR THE GOOD OF THE MEN.

2758
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,000
THAT'S ALL, LIEUTENANT.

2759
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
>> DO YOU THINK WE'RE SEEING

2760
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
MORE MOVIES OUT OF HOLLYWOOD ON

2761
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
THE MILITARY?

2762
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

2763
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
I THINK HOLLYWOOD IS VERY AFRAID

2764
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,000
OF ANY MILITARY FILMS BECAUSE

2765
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
THEY'RE TOUGH FOR THE AUDIENCE

2766
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
BECAUSE WE HAVE CONFLICTED

2767
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
FEELINGS ABOUT OUR INVOLVEMENT

2768
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.

2769
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
I THINK THE GREAT THING THAT HAS

2770
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
CHANGED IS WE HAVE 100%, ALMOST

2771
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:07,000
SEEMS LIKE 100% APPROVAL OF OUR

2772
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
VETERANS, AND SUPPORT FOR OUR

2773
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
VETERANS.
I KNOW THAT IS A HUGE

2774
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
IMPROVEMENT.

2775
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
>> RIGHT, SO WHERE THERE IS

2776
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
CONFLICT IT'S NOT OVER THE

2777
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
INDIVIDUALS.
>> RIGHT.
>> MOST PEOPLE LOOK AT THEM AS

2778
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
HEROES REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY

2779
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
FEEL ABOUT THE SPENDING OR THE

2780
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
WAR ITSELF.

2781
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
>> EXACTLY.

2782
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
>> THIS FILM IS BEING RELEASED

2783
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
FIRST ON VIDEO ON DEMAND.

2784
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000

2785
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,000

2786

THEATERS WHICH SEEMS TO ME TO BE

2787
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
A COMPLETE FLIP OF HOW IT USED

2788
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,000
TO WORK.

2789
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
>> RIGHT.

2790
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
IT'S EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF HOW

2791
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:37,000
IT USED TO WORK BUT NOW HOW IT'S

2792
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
DONE ON GOOD LOW BUDGET FILMS.

2793
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
THE IDEA IS TO GET WORD OF

2794
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
MOUTH, GET IT TALKED ABOUT ON

2795
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000

2796
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,000

01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Get a great deal on a new Subaru

choice of five charities.

2816
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
By the end of this, our fifth
year,

our total can reach almost 25
million dollars.
