137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
LOVE AND LIFE OF THE FAMILY.

CONVERSATION WAS IN PORTUGUESE,

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
AND SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING,

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
AND ASKED HOW I WAS DOING, I

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
SAID I WAS DOING WELL.

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
SHE SAID SHE LOVED ME, AND I

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
GAVE HER A KISS AND WALKED OUT

150
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THE DOOR.

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
>> SADLY FAMILIAR, THE MAKESHIFT

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000

TOWN, WITH CANDLES, TOYS,

154
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
FLOWERS LAID OUT.

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
THE PEOPLE HERE ARE DRAWING ON

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
THE BONDS FORGED IN A SMALL TOWN

157
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
SO THEY CAN SOMEHOW ENDURE THIS

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
SADNESS.

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000

00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
US.

188
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
TELL US ABOUT YOUR SIX-YEAR-OLD.

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
WHAT DID HE SEE?

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

191
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
>> UM, WELL, HE DID HEAR NOISES

192
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM, THEY ALL

193
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
DID.
AND AT THAT POINT HIS TEACHER,

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
VICKY SOTO, WHO IS A HERO IN ALL

195
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
OF OUR MINDS, A WONDERFUL

196
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
TEACHER, AND PERSON -- HAD THE

197
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
PRESENCE OF MIND TO MAKE SURE

198
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
THE CHILDREN WERE IN A

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
RELATIVELY SAFE AREA OF THE ROOM

200
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
AWAY FROM THE ENTRANCE OF THE
CLASSROOM, AND THEY WERE

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
WAITING, AND WAITING FOR SOMEONE

202
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
TO COME, AND AT THAT POINT THE

203
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
GUNMAN BURST INTO THE ROOM, AND

204
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
SHOT VICKY SOTO, AND THAT'S WHEN

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
MORE SHOTS WERE FIRED.

206
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
>> SO SHE WAS ACTUALLY SHOT IN

207
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
FRONT OF YOUR SIX-YEAR-OLD SON?

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
HE SAW THE SHOOTING?

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
>> CORRECT, YES, HE DID.

210
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
>> AND WHAT IS HE TELLING YOU

211
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
NOW, ROBERT, ABOUT HOW HE IS

212
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
FEELING AND HOW ARE YOU DEALING

213
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
WITH THIS?

214
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
>> UM, HE -- WE'RE TRYING TO

215
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
KEEP A NORMAL ROUTINE.

216
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
WE'RE TRYING TO GET HIM -- STILL

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
BRUSH HIS TEETH AND GO TO BED AT

218
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
A REASONABLE TIME.

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
BUT HE DOES ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
THE BAD PERSON, AND YESTERDAY

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
WAS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT.

222
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
HE WAS TEARFUL EVEN GOING HOME

223
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
AFTER WE LEFT THE POLICE

224
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
STATION.
HE IS GETTING BETTER, BUT HE IS

225
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
STILL AFRAID OF DEATH.

226
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
>> ROBERT, I UNDERSTAND YOU ALSO

227
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
HAVE A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

228
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
NAMED KALIN WHO WAS IN THE

229
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
CAFETERIA AND ACTUALLY IN

230
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
LEAVING THE SCHOOL, SAW THE

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
BODIES OF THESE CHILDREN?

232
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
>> HER CLASSROOM WAS NEAR THE

233
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
CAFETERIA.
SHE WAS IN HER ROOM WITH HER

234
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
TEACHER AND FELLOW STUDENTS, IN

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
A DIFFERENT SECTION OF THE

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
BUILDING.

237
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
BUT SHE DID, AS I'M SURE MANY OF

238
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
THE CHILDREN DID, BEAR WITNESS

239
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
TO VERY HORRIFIC THINGS.

240
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
YES, SHE DID SEE SOME BODIES,

241
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
YES.
>> OH, AND FINALLY, I UNDERSTAND

242
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
THAT YOUR SON UNDERSTANDABLY,

243
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
ADEN, WHO SAW HIS TEACHER BEING

244
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
SHOT, IS RELUCTANT TO BE

245
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
SEPARATED FROM THE FAMILY OR

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
FROM YOU.

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I IMAGINE THAT THAT'S NOT

248
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
SURPRISING.

249
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
>> YEAH.
SO WE'RE GOING -- WE'RE GETTING

250
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
THROUGH THIS WITH THE HELP AND

251
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
LOVE AND SUPPORT OF OUR FRIENDS,

252
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
OUR FAMILY, OUR NEIGHBORS, AND

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
WE'RE STAYING CLOSE.

254
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
THAT DOESN'T MEAN -- TODAY HE

255
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
DID HAVE A PLAY DATE WITH A GOOD

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
FRIEND OF HIS.

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
AT HIS FRIEND'S HOUSE.

258
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
SO AS LONG AS HE IS SOMEWHERE

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
WHERE HE FEELS SAFE, IT'S A GOOD

260
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
THING.
BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT HE WANTS

261
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
TO KNOW WHETHER WE'RE CLOSE BY

262
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
AND WANTS TO STAY IN FAMILIAR

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
PLACES.

264
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
>> CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDABLE.

265
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
ROBERT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

266
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
SHARING THIS WITH US AND ALL ENU

267
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
THIS EVENING.
AND TO YOUR SON AS WELL.

268
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
THANK YOU.

269
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
>> THANK YOU.

270
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
>> NOW I'M JOINED ON THE PHONE

271
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
BY STEVEN, WHOSE DAUGHTER

272
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
DESCRIBED TO HIM WHAT SHE HEARD

273
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
OVER THE LOUD SPEAKER FROM THE

274
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WHEN THE
SHOOTING BEGAN.

275
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
ARE YOU THERE, STEVEN?

276
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
>> YES, HI.

277
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
>> THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH

278
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
US.
I AM WELL.

279
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
HOW ARE YOU?

280
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
HOW IS YOUR EIGHT-YEAR-OLD

281
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
DAUGHTER?
>> SHE IS DOING PRETTY GOOD.

282
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
SAMANTHA IS A STRONG-WILLED

283
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
CHILD, THANK GOD, AND AT THIS

284
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
MOMENT WE'RE BOTH BLESSED, MY

285
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
WHOLE FAMILY HAS BEEN BLESSED,

286
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
THAT SHE CAME OUT OF THIS THING

287
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
PHYSICALLY OKAY.

288
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
BUT NATURALLY VERY ROTTEN

289
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
SITUATION TO BE INVOLVED IN.

290
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
IT'S BEEN VERY ROCKY.

291
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
>> STEVE --

292
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
>> GETTING BETTER.

293
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
>>  -- WHAT DID SHE SAY SHE

294
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
HEARD?

295
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
>> WHAT HAPPENED.
SHE WAS IN MRS. MARTIN'S CLASS,

296
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
AND THEY UNFORTUNATELY IN THEIR

297
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
CLASSROOM DON'T HAVE A BATHROOM
OR ANY MEANS OF HIDING OR

298
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
ESCAPING IN ANY CABINETS OR

299
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
ANYTHING.

300
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
SO THEY WERE IN THE CLASS, AND

301
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
IT SEEMS THAT ONE,

302
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
UNFORTUNATELY, DID TRIP THE LOUD

303
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
SPEAKER SYSTEM, AND SHE HEARD

304
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
CURSING COMING FROM THE LOUD

305
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
SPEAKER.

306
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
AND KIND OF LOOKED AROUND AND

307
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
THEN THEY HEARD -- SHE HEARD TWO

308
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
LARGE BOOM NOISES, AND THAT'S

309
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
WHEN MISS MARTIN WAS --

310
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
FABULOUS.
BASICALLY GOT THE KIDS IN THE

311
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
CORNER AND MADE THEM REMAIN

312
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
THERE QUIETLY, AND THEY JUST

313
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
WAITED IT OUT UNTIL THE POLICE

314
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
CAME.

315
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
>> STEVEN, THIS WHOLE

316
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
CIRCUMSTANCE, THIS WHOLE

317
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
SITUATION, WHEN DID YOU HEAR

318
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
ABOUT IT?

319
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
WHAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU

320
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
HEARD AND WHAT WERE YOUR FIRST

321
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
THOUGHTS?

322
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
>> THE TOWN IS -- AS EVERYBODY

323
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
HAS HEARD, ACROSS THE COUNTRY

324
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
AND THE WORLD, THE TOWN IS JUST

325
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
A GREAT, GREAT TOWN, AND WHAT

326
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
MOST AMERICANS DON'T UNDERSTAND

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT'S

328
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
OBVIOUSLY NEVER HAPPENS,

329
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
ESPECIALLY IN OUR TOWN.

330
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
SO THEY NEED TO BE AWARE, BUT

331
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
BASICALLY WE HAVE A REVERSE

332
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
9-1-1 SYSTEM WHICH CALLS ALL THE

333
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
PARENTS IN ANY EVENT THAT

334
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
HAPPENS, AND IF YOU SEE THAT,

335
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
AND I FIRST HEARD THERE WAS A

336
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
POSSIBLE SHOOTING, AND SO WHAT

337
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
IS RUNNING THROUGH YOUR MIND,

338
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
OBVIOUSLY, YOUR MIND JUST RACES

339
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
AND YOUR ADRENALINE JUST GOES

340
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
RIGHT TO YOUR HEAD.

341
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
SO BASICALLY I WAS AT MY OFFICE?

342
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
NEW YORK, AND OBVIOUSLY DROVE

343
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
TOWARDS NEWTOWN, AND ONE OF MY

344
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
FELLOW FATHERS -- FRIENDS, FRANK

345
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
DeMAYO, CALLED ME AND ACTUALLY

LOCATING OUR CHILDREN FOR US.

347
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
SO I HAD A SENSE OF RELIEF

348
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
BEFORE I ACTUALLY GOT THERE, BUT
UNTIL I ACTUALLY SAW HER FACE, I

349
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
WASN'T SATISFIED.

350
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
>> ALL RIGHT.

351
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
SO, STEPHEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH

352
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000

IT WAS NORMAL DAY FOR THE

>> YOU ARE WELCOME.

512
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
>> Judge Jeanine: HOW THE
KILLER GOT INTO THE SCHOOL.

513
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
...so as you can see, GEICO's
customer satisfaction is at 97%.

514
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Mmmm tasty.

515
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And cut! Very good.

516
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

517
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

518
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

519
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's not real.

520
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

521
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

522
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

523
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

524
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
INTRODUCING CHASE LIQUID.

526
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000

527

530
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000

531
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
GET CHASE LIQUID.

532
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
>> WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE

533
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
POINT OF ENTRY.

534
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I CAN TELL YOU IT HE WAS NOT

535
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
VOLUNTARILY LET INTO THE

536
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
SCHOOL AT ALL.

537
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
THAT HE FORCED HIS WAY INTO

538
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
THE SCHOOL.
THAT'S AS FAR AS WE CAN GO ON

539
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
THAT.

540
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
>> Judge Jeanine: YESTERDAY'S
MASSACRE WAS JUST THE LATEST

541
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
INCIDENT OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE

542
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS

543
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
COUNTRY.

544
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

545
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
HAD SAFETY MEASURES IN PLACE,

546
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
BUT THE SHOOTER WAS STILL ABLE

547
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
TO GAIN ENTRY WHICH RAISES THE

548
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
QUESTION HOW SAFE ARE OUR

549
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
SCHOOLS AND HOW SAFE ARE OUR

550
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
CHILDREN?

551
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000

552
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
POLICE CHIEF GARY MCNAMARA.

553
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

554
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

555
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
>> YOU ARE A POLICE CHIEF JUST

556
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
30 MILES FROM HERE.

557
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
>> JUST A LITTLE SOUTH OF

558
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
NEWTOWN, YEAH.

559
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
>>
>> Judge Jeanine: YOU ARE

560
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
FAMILIAR WITH THE ISSUE OF

561
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
SCHOOL VIOLENCE AND SCHOOL
SAFETY IN CONNECTICUT.

562
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
>> I AM.

563
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
>> CONNECTICUT IS A SMALL

564
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
STATE.
SO YOU KNOW THE CHIEFS OF

565
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
POLICE IN THE AREA REALLY GET

566
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
TOGETHER.
SO ANY TIME ANYTHING HAPPENS

567
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
WE REALLY DO COME TOGETHER AND

568
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
DISSECT IT TOGETHER.

569
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
>> Judge Jeanine: CHIEF, WHAT
IS MANDATED.

570
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
IS CONNECTICUT, IS THERE

571
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
ANYTHING THAT'S REQUIRED OF

572
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
THIS STATE?

573
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
>> THERE IS, ALL SCHOOLS HAVE

574
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
TO HAVE A CRISIS PLAN IN

575
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
PLACE.

576
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
AND THEN EVERY THREE MONTHS

577
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
AFTER COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL IN

578
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
2000, THEY HAVE TO -- EVERY

579
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
THREE MONTHS PUT THAT PLAN

580
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
INTO PLACE.

581
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT, THE

582
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS HAVE TO

583
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
WORK WITH LOCAL LAW

584
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
ENFORCEMENT EVERY THREE

585
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
MONTHS.
SORT OF LIKE A FIRE DRILL TO

586
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN TO ENSURE

587
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
--
>> -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THESE

588
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
CHILDREN ACTUALLY HAD GONE

589
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
THROUGH SOME OF THE FIRE
DRILLS AND THEY HAD DONE THAT.

590
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
BUT THE ISSUE OF SAFETY AND

591
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
THE THREAT ASSESSMENT, I MEAN,

592
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

593
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
MANDATE THAT EVERY SCHOOL HAVE

594
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
A THREAT ASSESSMENT DONE

595
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
REGARDING SAFETY?

596
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
>> WELL, I THINK THERE IS SOME

597
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
SORT OF A MANDATE.

598
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
AND I'M NOT REALLY FAMILIAR

599
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
WITH HOW HEAVY THAT MANDATE

600
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
IS.
BUT I THINK GIVEN THE

601
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
ATMOSPHERE.
IT'S A PUBLIC MANDATE.

602
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A THREAT

603
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
ASSESSMENT IN EACH SCHOOL.

604
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
>> Judge Jeanine: WHO DECIDES,
CHIEF, HOW MUCH SAFETY IS

605
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
IMPLEMENTED AT A PARTICULAR

606
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
SCHOOL.
>> I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE

607
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

608
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
IT DEPENDS ON THE LAW

609
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
ENFORCEMENT AND THE DESIGN OF

610
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
THE SCHOOL.

611
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
HOW OLD THE SCHOOLS ARE.

612
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
>> Judge Jeanine: IT'S REALLY

613
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
THE LOCALS WHO DECIDE THIS?

614
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
>> IT COMES DOWN FROM THE

615
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
STATE.
SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN GO TO THE

616
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
STATE POLICE AND GO TO THE

617
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
STATE FOR THREAT ASSESSMENT.

618
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
>> Judge Jeanine: ALL RIGHT.
AND FINALLY THIS IS NOT THE

619
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
FIRST TIME THAT THIS STATE HAS

620
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
DEALT WITH THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL

621
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
VIOLENCE.

622
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
>> IT HAS NOT.
WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SOMETHING

623
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
IN FAIRFIELD BACK IN 2002, A

624
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
CLASSROOM FULL OF STUDENTS

625
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
HELD HOSTAGE FOR A PERIOD OF 8

626
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
HOURS.
THANKFULLY NOBODY WAS INJURED

627
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
AS THE CASE HERE.

628
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
IT TOUCHES ALL OF US.

629
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
CONNECTICUT IS A SMALL STATE.

630
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
WE ARE ALL HERE HELPING

631
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
TOGETHER.

632
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
>> Judge Jeanine: UNFORTUNATELY

633
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
WE HAD MANY DIE IN JUST OVER
THE WOODS BEHIND ME RIGHT NOW.

634
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
CHIEF, FINALLY, VERY QUICKLY,

635
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS COULD
HAVE BEEN PREVENTED?

636
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
>> YOU KNOW, GIVEN THE MINIMUM

637
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
FACTS I HAVE, I DON'T THINK IT

638
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED.

639
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> I THINK WE HAVE SAVED A LOT

640
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
MORE KIDS THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN

641
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
DONE IF THERE WERE NO PLANS IN

642
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
PLACE.
>> I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO WORK

643
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
A LITTLE HARDER THOUGH.

644
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
CHIEF MCNAMARA THANK YOU FOR

645
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
BEING WITH US THIS EVENING.

646
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> COMING UP:  WHO WAS THIS

647
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
SHOOTER WHO LITERALLY

648
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
UNLEASHED HELL AT AN

649
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

650
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
COMING UP INSIDE THE MIND OF A

651
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
KILLER.

652
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
There is no
mass-produced human.

653
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Every human being
is unique.

654
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And there is one store
that recognizes it.

655
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000

eep Number.

674

Comfort Individualized.

675
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
This holiday season, give
the gift that's magical:

676
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
the innovative AirFit
adjustable pillow at

677
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
special 30% savings.

678
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
HE LOVES RISK.

679
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
BUT WHETHER
HE'S CLIMBING EVEREST,

680
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
SCUBA DIVING THE
GREAT BARRIER REEF WITH SHARKS,

681
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
OR JUMPING INTO THE MARKET,
HE GOES WITH PEOPLE HE TRUSTS,

682
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
WHICH IS WHY HE TRADES
WITH A COMPANY

683
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
THAT DOESN'T NICKEL AND DIME
HIM WITH HIDDEN FEES.

684
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
SO HE CAN WORRY
ABOUT OTHER THINGS,

685
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
LIKE WHAT THE MARKET IS DOING

686
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
AND BEING READY,
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

687
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
WHICH ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

688
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE,
FROM TD AMERITRADE.

689
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
>> HE WAS DIFFERENT, HE WAS

690
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
QUIET.
NICE KID.
GOOD KID.

691
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I MEAN, HE WAS DEFINITELY

692
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
CHALLENGE THE FAMILY IN THAT

693
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
HOUSE.

694
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
EVERY FAMILY HAS ONE.
I HAVE ONE.

695
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
THEY HAVE ONE.

696
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
BUT NEVER IN TROUBLE WITH THE

697
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
LAW.

698
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
NEVER IN TROUBLE WITH

699
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
ANYTHING.

700
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I KNOW SHE HAD ISSUES WITH

701
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
SCHOOL.
SHE EVENTUALLY WOUND UP HOME

702
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
SCHOOLING HIM.
SHE BATTLED WITH THE SCHOOL

703
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
DISTRICT.
IN WHAT CAPACITY I'M NOT 100%

704
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
CERTAIN IF IT WAS BEHAVIOR OR

705
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
LEARNING DISABILITIES, I

706
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
REALLY DON'T KNOW BUT IS HE A

707
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
VERY VERY BRIGHT BOY.

708
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
HE IS SMART.

709
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
>> Judge Jeanine: IT DOESN'T

710
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
MAKE SENSE.

711
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

712
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
SHOOTER.
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU MY

713
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
BACKGROUND, I'M REALLY NOT SO

714
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
INTERESTED IN THE MENTAL STATE

715
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
OF THE SHOOTER.
I'M INTERESTED IN THE VICTIM.

716
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'M INTERESTED IN THE PEOPLE

717
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
WHO NEVER CHOSE TO BE A VICTIM

718
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
IN THE FIRST PLACE AS OPPOSED

719
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
TO GUY WHO MAKES A A DECISION

720
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
TO DRESS UP IN BLACK GARB AND

721
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
A MILITARY VEST AND TAKE A

722
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
LONG GUN AND TWO

723
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
SEMIAUTOMATICS AND COME INTO
THE SCHOOL WHERE THE MOST

724
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
VULNERABLE VICTIMS IN OUR

725
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
SOCIETY ARE AND TAKE THEIR

726
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
LIVES.
TO ME, THE ISSUE OF THE STATE

727
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
OF MIND OF THE CRIMINAL IS NOT

728
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
SO MUCH ABOUT HIS STATE OF

729
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
MIND BUT ABOUT HIS CHOICE.

730
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
HE IS THE ONE WHO CHOSE TO

731
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
PICK UP A GUN.

732
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
HE IS THE ONE WHO CHOSE TO

733
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
MAKE A DECISION TO KILL.

734
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
BUT HAVING SAID THAT, MY

735
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
PROSECUTOR BACKGROUND I WILL

736
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
NOW PUT ON HOLD AND I WILL ASK

737
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
AND FIRST OF ALL INTRODUCE

738
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
DR. JOHN SHARP, WHO IS A

739
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
PSYCHIATRIST ON THE FACULTY OF

740
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
THE HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,

741
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
DR. SHARP, SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU

742
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
HERE.
YOU HEARD ME RAMP, I DON'T

743
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
MUCH CARE ABOUT THIS GUY'S

744
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
STATE OF MIND.

745
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I CARE ABOUT THE VICTIMS.

746
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THE VICTIM'S FAMILY THE RIPPLE

747
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
EFFECT.
THE FACT THAT THIS TOWN WILL

748
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
FOREVER BEAR THE INSIGNIFICANT

749
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
ANY I CAN'T INSIGNIA THAT

750
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
HAPPENS HERE.

751
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT GRIEVING

752
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
AND.

753
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
>> I'M A PARENT.

754
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I DROP THEM OFF AT THAT SCHOOL

755
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WOULD

756
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
LEARN TO BE SAFE.

757
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
WHAT AM I FEELING RIGHT NOW?

758
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
>> YOU ARE FEELING ANGRY.

759
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
YOU ARE FEELING SCARED.

760
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
YOU ARE FEELING SO MANY

761
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
DIFFERENT EMOTIONS IT'S HARD

762
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
TO KEEP THEM STRAIGHT.

763
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
EVERYONE WOKE UP TODAY TO THE

764
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
WORST NIGHTMARE TO EVEN

765
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
IMAGINE THAN WHEN THEY WENT TO

766
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
BED LAST NIGHT.

767
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
WHAT PARENTS HAVE TO DO IS

768
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
PROVIDE A SENSE OF SAFETY FOR

769
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
THEIR CHILDREN.

770
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
>> Judge Jeanine: BUT THEY

771
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
DIDN'T.
DO THEY LIVE WITH GUILT?

772
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
HOW DO THEY RESOLVE WHAT THEY

773
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
HAVE GONE THROUGH?

774
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
HOW DO THEY PROTECT THEIR OWN

775
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
CHILDREN.
>> WHAT WE KNOW TWO DIFFERENT

776
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
THINGS.

777
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
THAT DOESN'T MAKE US FEEL

778
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
BETTER OR SAFE WHEN WE

779
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
CONSIDER DROPPING OUR KID

780
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
SOMEWHERE OR GOING TO A MALL.

781
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WE

782
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
CAN SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER AND

783
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
RECREATE A SENSE OF SAFETY.

784
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
AND MAKE SURE THE KIDS FEEL

785
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THAT WAIT A MINUTE KIDS CAN BE

786
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
MORE RESILIENT THAN ADULTS

787
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
EVEN.

788
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
>> Judge Jeanine: I HE AGREE KIS

789
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
ARE MORE RESILIENT.

790
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
WE JUST SPOKE WITH A FATHER

791
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
WHOSE 6-YEAR-OLD IS AFRAID TO

792
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
HAVE HIM LEAVE HIM SIDE.

793
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
>> THAT'S A NORMAL RESPONSE.

794
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
RESPOND TO WHAT YOU ARE SEEING

795
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
IN YOUR CHILDREN.

796
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
IT'S DIFFERENT IF YOU ARE
TALKING TO A 6-YEAR-OLD OR A

797
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
PRETEEN OR TEEN.

798
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
6-YEAR-OLD IS VERY CONCRETE.

799
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
YOU WANT TO SEE THOUSAND THEY

800
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
ARE FEELING.
MAKE SURE THEY FEEL SAFE.

801
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
OBSERVE THEM AND COMFORT THEM.

802
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
PRETEENS GET CAUGHT UP IN

803
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
MORALITY.

804
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
VERY BLACK AND WHITE.

805
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
MAKE SURE THEY ARE THINKING

806
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
RIGHT.
>> Judge Jeanine: WHAT ABOUT

807
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
THE KIDS WHO ARE WATCHING

808
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
TELEVISION AND SHOULD PARENTS

809
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

810
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
SITUATION TO TALK TO THEIR

811
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
CHILDREN AND SAY THIS IS WHAT

812
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
YOU SHOULD DO OR THIS IS, YOU

813
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
KNOW, WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

814
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
WORLD?
>> ESPECIALLY THEY ARE TEENAGE

815
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
YEARS.
THE YOUNGER I THINK LESS

816
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
EXPOSURE THE BETTER.

817
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
ALL OF US CAN OVERDOSE ON

818
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
TELEVISION.
WE SHOULDN'T OVERDO IT IN ANY

819
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
WAY.
WE SHOULDN'T OVERDRINK OR

820
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
EXERCISE OR ISOLATE.

821
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
WE SHOULD TRY TO BE MOD

822
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
DEMOCRAT AND IN COMMUNICATION

823
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
WITH ONE ANOTHER AND OPEN TO

824
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
RECEIVE WHATEVER SUPPORT IS

825
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
GOING TO HELP US.

826
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
COUNSELORS, RELIGIOUS SUPPORT.

827
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
ONE ANOTHER.

828
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
>> WELL, OKAY.

829
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE

830
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
CHILDREN AND THE PARENTS WHO

831
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
CLEAR LIVE WILL GO INTO A

832
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
DEPRESSION?
>> WELL, THAT CAN BE TREATED.

833
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
SO I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

834
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
THINK THAT THAT'S A FAILURE.

835
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
WE DON'T THINK OF THAT OF ANY

836
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
KIND OF A SHORT OR MORAL

837
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
UPCOMING.

838
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
THAT'S VERY TREATABLE.

839
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE

840
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
SHOOTER HERE.

841
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
HE PLAY HAVE HAD A CONDITION

842
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
TOO.

843
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
ANYBODY SUFFERING NOW CAN BE
TREATED AND MOVE TOWARD

844
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
HEALING.
>> Judge Jeanine: FINAL

845
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
QUESTION BEFORE I GO TO

846
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
DR. BARBARA KERWIN A FORENSIC

847
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
PSYCHOLOGIST SITTING IN NEW
YORK CITY NOW.

848
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE SAY CAN THIS

849
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
KIND OF THING BE PREVENTED AND

850
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
YOU THINK THAT MAYBE IT CAN

851
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
BE, IF YOU KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT

852
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
THE INDIVIDUAL.

853
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
YOU KNOW, MY QUESTION REALLY

854
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
IS WHY IS THE WORLD SO

855
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
DIFFERENT TODAY?

856
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
WHY ARE PEOPLE DOING THIS?

857
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
WHY IS THIS BECOMING THE NORM?

858
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE THE

859
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
ONE ANSWER FOR THAT.

860
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
PEOPLE THINK THAT THERE IS A

861
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
TOO MUCH OF CULTURE OF

862
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
VIOLENCE.
PEOPLE ARE TOO ISOLATED IN

863
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
THEIR OWN MINDS.

864
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM ISN'T

865
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE.

866
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
LOVING EMBRACE THAT INSISTED

867
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
ON THERAPY OF A MEANINGFUL

868
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
SORT THAT HE COULD HAVE

869
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
ACCESSED AND AFFORD COULD HAVE

870
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
AVOIDED THIS.

871
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
>> DOCTOR, THANKS SO MUCH FOR

872
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
BEING WITH US THIS EVENING.

873
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
KNOW, DOCTOR, YOU RAN THE UNIT

874
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
FOR THE VIOLENT CRIMINALLY

875
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
INSANE AT CREED MORE.

876
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
SO YOU HAVE GOT A LOT OF

877
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
EXPERIENCE WITH THIS KIND OF

878
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
THING.
WERE THERE A TELL TALE SIGNS

879
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
OR ARE THERE PREDICTABLE

880
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
ISSUES OR FACTORS THAT WOULD

881
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
IDENTIFY THIS INDIVIDUAL AS A

882
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
DANGEROUS INDIVIDUAL.

883
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
>> WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH HIM

884
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
IS THE STORY THAT WE SEE AGAIN

885
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
AND AGAIN WITH THESE COINS OF

886
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
CREEPY PEOPLE THAT GO IN AND

887
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
UNLEASH THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE.

888
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
HE WAS THE LONER, HE DIDN'T

889
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
GET ALONG WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

890
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
HE HAD ISSUES IN SCHOOL.

891
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
HE WAS BRILL YENT.

892
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
BRIGHT AND SOMETHING WAS

893
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
DISTURBLILY WRONG AND NOBODY

894
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
SEEMED TO TAKE NOTICE OF IT

895
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
UNTIL WE HAVE THE UNTHINKABLE.

896
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
IT'S NOT SO UNTHINKABLE WHEN

897
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
WE HAVE A UNBALANCED PARANOID

898
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
ANGRY ISOLATED INDIVIDUAL.

899
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
IS HE REALLY FOLLOWING THE

900
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
PATTERN OF THAT PARANOID TYPE.

901
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
WE HAD JAMES HOLMES OUT IN

902
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
AURORA, COLORADO.

903
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
A SIMILAR KIND OF PERSONALITY.

904
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
AND MY ISSUE IS WHEN ARE WE

905
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
GOING TO BECOME AWARE OF THIS?

906
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO

907
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
INTERVENE?
>> Judge Jeanine: DOCTOR, IS

908
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
THERE ANY WAY FOR US AS A

909
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
SOCIETY TO SAY THIS GUY IS A

910
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
LONER, WE BETTER CHECK HIM

911
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
OUT?
LOOK, WHEN I WAS A JUDGE, THEY

912
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
BRING PEOPLE IN FLONT OF ME

913
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
AND SAY HE IS DANGER TO THE

914
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
COMMUNITY OR HIMSELF I DO A

915
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
PSYCHIATRIC ON HIM.

916
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
THIEVES ARE YOWNEL MALES IN

917
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
THEIR 20 WE ARE TALKING '.

918
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000

AND THEY JUST TOLD THE

1281
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
CHILDREN THAT IT WAS HAMMERING

1282
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
AND TRIED TO KEEP THEM CALM.

1283
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
THE NEXT THING I KNOW BECAUSE

1284
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET THE

1285
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
COMPLETE STORY.

1286
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
THE NEXT THING I KNOW IS THAT

1287
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
THE POLICE CAME IN AND THEY

1288
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
WERE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR TO

1289
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
BE LET OUT.

1290
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
OF THE CLASSROOM.

1291
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
AND WHEN THEY WERE, SHE HAD

1292
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
SEEN GLASS AND BLOOD.

1293
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
ONE CHILD WAS COVERED IN BLOOD

1294
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT CHILD IS

1295
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
SAFE AND WAS NOT HURT AND MUST

1296
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY ELSE'S.

1297
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
>> IT'S SHEAR TERROR AND A

1298
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
SENSE OF IMMEDIATE URGENCY.

1299
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
AND, YOU KNOW, TO GET TO YOUR

1300
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
CHILD AND TO BE THERE TO

1301
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
PROTECT THEM.

1302
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
>> 18 CHILDREN PRONOUNCED DEAD

1303
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
AT THE SCHOOL.

1304
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
THERE WERE TWO THAT WERE

1305
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
TRANSPORTED TO AREA HOSPITALS

1306
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
AND PRONOUNCED DEAD AT AREA

1307
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
HOSPITALS.
THERE WERE SIX ADULTS

1308
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE

1309
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
AT THE SCHOOL.

1310
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
>> WE HAVE ENDURED TOO MANY OF

1311
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
THESE TRAGEDIESED IN THE PAST

1312
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
FEW YEARS.

1313
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
AND EACH TIME I LEARN THE

1314
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
NEWS, I REACT NOT AS A

1315
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
PRESIDENT BUT AS ANYBODY ELSE

1316
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
WOULD, AS A PARENT.

1317
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE

1318
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
TODAY.
I KNOW THERE IS NOT A PARENT

1319
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
IN AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL

1320
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
THE SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF

1321
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
THAT I DO.

1322
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

1323
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

1324
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

1325
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS

1326
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
OLD.

1327
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

1328
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
AHEAD OF THEM.

1329
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS,

1330
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
WEDDINGS, KIDS OF THEIR OWN
