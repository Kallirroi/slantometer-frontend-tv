00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
>>> IT IS 10:00 IN NEWTOWN,

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
CONNECTICUT, A COMMUNITY STILL

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
STRUGGLING WITH GRIEF AND STILL

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
REACHING OUT TO ONE ANOTHER FOR

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
COMFORT AND BEGINNING THE LONG

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
PROCESS OF SAYING GOODBYE TO SO

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
MANY YOUNG LIVES, LIVES CUT FAR

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
TOO SHORT.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
MAKESHIFT MEMORIALS REMIND THE

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
PEOPLE OF THIS COMMUNITY THEY

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
ARE NOT ALONE IN THEIR GRIEF AND

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
PEOPLE STOP BY TO LEAVE CANDLES

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
AND FLOWERS AND TEDDY BEARS AND

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
NOTES OF COMFORT.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
IT IS A DAUNTING CONCEPT, THE

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
IDEA OF TRYING SOMEHOW TO MOVE

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000

LIVES FRIDAY AND TRYING TO MOVE

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
ON WITHOUT THE SIX ADULTS ALSO
KILLED AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
MOVING ON MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
FOR A VERY LONG TIME IF EVER.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
IT IS NOT CLEAR JUST WHEN THE

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
STUDENTS OF SANDY HOOK WILL

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
RETURN TO CLASS BUT WHEN THEY

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
DO, IT WILL BE IN A DIFFERENT

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
BUILDING, A DIFFERENT SCHOOL, IN

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
A NEIGHBORING TOWN.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT NOW.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000

THE ROOM AND HE WANTED NOTHING

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
MORE THAN TO CATCH UP WITH HIS

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
OLDER BROTHER BEN WHOM HE WOULD

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000

NOAH DID NOT.

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
>> WE ARE ALL COMPLETELY

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000

IT HAS BEEN A VERY, VERY ROUGH

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
FEW DAYS.

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
NOBODY IS GETTING MUCH SLEEP.

WE'RE HOLDING TOGETHER AS BEST

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
WE CAN.

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
YOU NEVER, EVER THINK THAT

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN
TO YOUR FAMILY.

>> NOAH'S AUNT SAYS HE LOVED TO

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
READ AND FIGURE OUT HOW THINGS

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
WORKED.
SHE SAID HE WAS EXTREMELY

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
LIVELY, THE LIGHT OF THE ROOM.

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
SHE WILL REMEMBER HIS BIG BLUE

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
EYES, A BOY WITH A BIG HEART,

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000

SISTERS, AND BROTHER AND HIS

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
TWIN MOST OF ALL.

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
>> THEY DON'T KNOW THE WAY IN

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
WHICH NOAH PASSED AWAY, BUT

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE THERE DURING

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
THE WHOLE EVENT, AND WERE LET

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
OUT AND IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
SHE JUST TURNED SIX.

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
SHE JUST IS UNDER SIX, AND THEIR

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
OLDER SISTER SOPHIA IS NOT QUITE

THEM THAT'S HOW THEIR BROTHER

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000

IT IS JUST THE UNTHINKABLE

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
REALLY.

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
LIFE AND DEVOID OF MEANNESS.

YOUR 6-YEAR-OLD BEING.

136
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
WE'RE ALL ELEVATED IN HUMANITY

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
BY HAVING KNOWN YOU, A LITTLE

MAVERICK THAT DIDN'T ALWAYS WANT

TO DO HIS SCHOOLWORK OR CLEAN UP

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
HIS TOYS WHEN PRACTICING HIS

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
PLANTED ON EARTH TO BLOOM IN

146
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
TAKE FLIGHT, MY BOY.

SOAR.
THE WORDS OF A MOTHER GRIEVING

149
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
FOR HER LOST SON.

150
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
ONE THING THAT WE HAVE BEEN

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
DOING IS TRYING TO KEEP OUR

152
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
FOCUS ON THE LIVES LOST AND THE

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
LIVES OF THE PEOPLE HERE WHO

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000

AND OFTEN PUT THEMSELVES IN

157
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
HARM'S WAY TO DO IT, THE

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
TEACHERS AND THE SCHOOL

159
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
ADMINISTRATORS AND WE HAVE

160
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
AVOIDED FOCUSING ON THE KILLER

161
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
BECAUSE HE HAS GONE AND FRANKLY

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
WE DON'T WANT HIM TO BE

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000

187
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
VICTIMS AND ALSO THE HEROES OF

188
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
THIS TRAGEDY, THE TEACHERS THAT

189
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
DID SO MUCH TO PROTECT THEIR

190
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
STUDENTS AND THE FIRST

191
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
RESPONDERS.
HERE IS WHAT LIEUTENANT VANCE OF

192
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
SAID ABOUT THE FIRST RESPONDERS.

194
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
>> THE FACULTY, STAFF IN THAT

195
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
SCHOOL DID EVERYTHING THAT THEY

196
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
POSSIBLY COULD TO PROTECT THOSE

197
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
CHILDREN.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FIRST

198
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
RESPONDERS THAT GOT TO THE SCENE

199
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
ENTERED THAT SCHOOL AND SAVED

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
MANY HUMAN LIVES.

201
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I CAN TELL YOU IT BROKE OUR

202
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
HEARTS THAT WE COULDN'T SAVE

203
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
THEM ALL.

204
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
>> LAST NIGHT'S MEMORIAL, THE

205
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
FIRST RESPONDERS GOT A STANDING

206
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
OVATION FROM A VERY GRATEFUL
COMMUNITY.

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
ROB AND RAY ARE FIRE FIGHTERS

208
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
WITH THE NEWTOWN HOOK AND LADDER

209
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
COMPANY AND JOIN ME LIVE.

210
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

211
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
HOW YOU ARE YOU HOLDING UP.

212
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
>> IT IS DIFFICULT EVERY DAY.

213
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
EVERY DAY IT IS A LITTLE BETTER,

214
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
BUT IT IS A CHALLENGE, CERTAINLY

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
A CHALLENGE.

216
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I KNOW
USUAL DOING IS HANDING OUT GIFTS

217
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
TO LITTLE KIDS, THINGS FROM THE

218
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
RED CROSS.
IT HAS TO BRING SOME COMFORT.

219
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
>> DEFINITELY HELPS.

220
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF STUFFED

221
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
ANIMALS AND TEDDY BEARS HAVE

222
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
BEEN STREAMING INTO THE FIRE

223
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
HOUSE AND WE'RE DOING WHAT WE

224
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
CAN TO GET IT OUT TO THE

225
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
CHILDREN IN TOWN.

226
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
>> YOU WERE BORN HERE, RIGHT.

227
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
>> YES.

228
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
>> TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THIS

229
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
COMMUNITY.

230
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I HAVE JUST BEEN STRUCK BY HOW

231
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
CLOSE KNIT IT SEEMS AND PROBABLY

232
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
NOW MORE THAN EVER.

233
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
>> THE OVER POURING OF SUPPORT

234
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
FROM PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND

235
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
THE UNITY AND THE EMOTION IS

236
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
JUST OVERWHELMING.

237
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH OF THE

238
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
SUPPORT WE HAVE BEEN GETTING

239
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
FROM EVEN OUTSIDE OTHER

240
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
COMMUNITIES AND ALL AROUND THE

241
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
COUNTRY, THE PHONES RINGING OFF

242
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
THE HOOK FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO

243
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
BRING FOOD OR SUPPLIES OR

244
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
WHATEVER THEY CAN.
>> I KNOW ON THAT HORRIBLE DAY

245
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
ON FRIDAY YOU GUYS WERE ASSIGNED

246
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
TO A TRIAGE AREA.

247
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
IT DIDN'T UNFORTUNATELY END UP

248
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
BEING USED.

249
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN JUST A

250
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
SICKENING FEELING TO BE THERE AT

251
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THIS TRIAGE UNIT AND REALIZE

252
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
THERE IS NOT PEOPLE COMING IN.

253
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
>> AT THE TIME A FEW TIMES

254
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
DURING THE INCIDENT I ACTUALLY

255
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
THOUGHT TO MYSELF SHOULD I BE

256
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
HOPING THAT THIS AREA WAS FILLED

257
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
WITH INJURED PEOPLE?

258
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I WAS ALMOST WISHING THAT IT

259
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
WAS -- THE CASE, FAIRLY EARLY ON

260
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
WE REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T GOING

261
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
TO BE THE CASE AND IT WAS

262
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
BASICALLY SET UP FOR NOTHING.

263
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
>> HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH

264
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AS A FIRST

265
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
RESPONDER?

266
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
EVERYBODY THINKS ABOUT OBVIOUSLY

267
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
THE CHILDREN AND THE TEACHERS

268
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
AND ALL OF THOSE WHO LOST THEIR

269
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
LIVES AND THE PARENTS, BUT THE

270
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
THINGS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE TO

271
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
DEAL WITH, THERE IS -- IT NEVER

272
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
LEAVES YOU.
>> NO.

273
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
NO.
>> HAVE YOU A JOB TO DO AT THE

274
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
TIME AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

275
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
THINKING ABOUT AT THE TIME.

276
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
YOU REALLY DON'T THINK TOO MUCH

277
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
ABOUT THAT KIND OF STUFF UNTIL

278
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
LATER, AND EVEN NOW THERE IS

279
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
STILL A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON

280
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
AND I THINK IT WILL GET WORSE

281
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
BEFORE IT GETS BETTER.

282
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
>> YEAH.

283
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT IN THE

284
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS AND WHEN

285
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
THERE IS A LOT OF FOCUS AND

286
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
ATTENTION AND ADRENALINE GETS

287
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
YOU THROUGH, BUT IT IS OFTEN IN

288
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
THE WEEKS AFTER THAT THE PEOPLE

289
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
GO AWAY AND THE REST OF THE

290
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
WORLD KEEPS SPINNING AND RETURNS

291
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
TO SOME SEMBLANCE OF NORMAL,

292
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
THEN IT IS THIS TOWN WHICH WILL

293
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
BE LEFT WITH AN OPEN WOUND.

294
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
>> THERE IS GOING TO BE A NEW

295
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
NORMAL, I THINK.

296
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
THE OLD NORMAL A WEEK AGO IS

297
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
GONE, I BELIEVE.

298
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
>> LIVE IN COMPLACENCY ALL THESE

299
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
YEARS AND IT IS GONE.

300
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
WE'LL BE SCARRED FOREVER FROM

301
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
THIS, I THINK.
>> WE WILL RECOVER OBVIOUSLY.

302
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
LIKE ROB SAID, WE'RE WITH A

303
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
CLOSE KNIT COMMUNITY AND WE'LL

304
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
RECOVER SOMEWHAT, BUT IT IS LIKE

305
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
ROB SAID.
THE SCARS ARE NOT GOING TO GO

306
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
AWAY.
>> SCARS HEAL BUT REMAIN AND

307
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE.

308
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL YOU HAVE

309
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
DONE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

310
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000

317

DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE

318
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
PEOPLE WANT TO FORGET BECAUSE

319
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
THEY DON'T.

320
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
THIS TOWN WILL NEVER FORGET AND

321
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
THEY JUST NEED TO TRY TO FIGURE

322

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000

CONFERENCE, WHERE HE ALSO

356
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
RECOUNTED THE MOMENTS AFTER THE

358
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
DELIVER TO THE PARENTS WHO WERE

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
WAITING FOR NEWS ABOUT THEIR

361
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
DELIVER THE WORST POSSIBLE NEWS.

362
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
>> IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT

363
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
THERE WAS A RELUCTANCE TO TELL

364
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
PARENTS AND LOVED ONES THAT THE

365
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
PERSON THAT THEY WERE WAITING

PERIOD OF TIME, WELL AFTER THERE

368
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
WAS ANY EXPECTANCY THAT FAMILIES

369
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
WOULD BE REUNITED.

370
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I MADE THE DECISION THAT TO HAVE

371
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
THAT GO ON ANY LONGER WAS WRONG.

372
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
SO I DID IT.

373
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
>> I TALKED TO LYNN McDONNELL.
KATE BALDWIN JOINS ME NOW.

374
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I TALKED TO LYNN McDONNELL

375
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
EARLIER.

376
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THE FULL

377
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
INTERVIEW TOMORROW.

378
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I TALKED TO HER AND HER HUSBAND

379
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
CHRIS ABOUT THAT WAIT.

380
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
THEY THOUGHT MAYBE THEIR LITTLE

381
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
GRACE WAS IN SOME PLACE THAT WAS

382
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
SAFE.

383
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
AND THEN SLOWLY IT BEGAN TO DAWN

384
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
ON PEOPLE THAT THAT WAS NOT THE

385
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
CASE.
SO WHAT ARE THE PLANS NOW FOR

386
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
SCHOOLS?

387
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
>> IT REALLY STARTED KICKING

388
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
INTO ACTION THE SAME DAY AS THE
HORROR WAS UNFOLDING.

389
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
NO ONE WANTS TO SEND THE

390
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
CHILDREN BACK TO SANDY HOOK

391
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
ELEMENTARY.

392
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
THEY KNOW THAT IT'S CLEARLY NOT

393
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
TIME FOR THAT.
IT'S STILL A CRIME SCENE RIGHT

394
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
NOW.

395
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
SO THEY MADE PLANS WITH THE

396
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
NEIGHBORING TOWN FOR A SCHOOL
JUST SIX MILES AWAY.

397
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
ALMOST -- IT'S VERY FORTUITOUS.

398
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
BUT THERE WAS AN EMPTY MIDDLE

399
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED BECAUSE OF

400
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
DECLINING ENROLLMENT LAST YEAR.

401
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
SO THE NEIGHBORING TOWN MONROE,

402
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE TOWN,

403
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
HE CALLED THEM RIGHT AWAY THAT

404
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
SAME DAY AND SAID IF YOU WANT

405
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
IT, IT'S YOURS.

406
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
AND SO THEY'VE BEEN WORKING

407
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
AROUND THE CLOCK.

408
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
CONTRACTORS FROM AROUND THE

409
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
REGION HAVE BEEN DONATING THEIR

410
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
TIME TO GET THIS FACILITY, IT'S

411
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
A FORMER MIDDLE SCHOOL UP TO

412
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
SNUFF AND UP TO CODE.

413
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
THEY HAVE TO CHANGE, REALLY,

414
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
EVERYTHING.

415
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
THE BONES ARE STRONG.

416
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
IT'S A SCHOOL.

417
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
BUT THEY HAVE TO LOWER
EVERYTHING.

418
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
THEY HAVE TO REPLACE TOILETS TO
BE SMALL ENOUGH FOR CHILDREN,

419
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN.

420
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
THEY HAVE TO LOWER TOWEL

421
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
DISPENSERS.

422
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
>> DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE KIDS ARE

423
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
GOING TO GO BACK?

424
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
>> THAT'S UP TO TOWN OFFICIALS.

425
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
THE MONROE TOWN OFFICIALS TOLD

426
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
ME TODAY THE BUILDING ITSELF

427
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
COULD BE READY AS EARLY AS

428
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
TOMORROW.

429
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING AROUND THE

430
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
CLOCK TO GET IT READY.

431
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
BUT WHEN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS

432
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
READY TO ASK THE CHILDREN TO

433
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
COME BACK TO SCHOOL, THAT'S UP

434
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
TO NEWTOWN SCHOOL OFFICIALS.

435
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
AND THIS FRIDAY IS SUPPOSED TO

436
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
BE THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL BEFORE

437
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
THE HOLIDAY BREAK.

438
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
SO IT COULD BE, YOU KNOW, ONLY A
DAY OR TWO THAT THEY'LL BE IN

439
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
CLASS.

440
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
BUT SOME ARE SAYING, WE ACTUALLY
TALKED ABOUT IT WITH SANJAY

441
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
EARLIER, SOME ARE SAYING THAT'S

442
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
REALLY WHAT THE KIDS NEED TO DO.

443
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
THEY NEED TO GET BACK INTO THAT

444
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
ROUTINE.
BECAUSE ONCE THEY GET INTO THAT

445
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
ROUTINE AND BACK INTO SCHOOL AND

446
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
BACK FOCUSING ON THEIR SCHOOL

447
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
AND WORK, THAT'S GOING TO HELP

448
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
THEM HEAL FASTER.

449
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
>> AND OF COURSE THERE ARE GOING
TO BE A NUMBER OF FUNERALS ALL

450
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
THIS WEEK.

451
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
>> YES.

452
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
>> WE SAW TWO TODAY.

453
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I KNOW GRACE McDONNELL, THAT THE

454
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
WAKE IS ON THURSDAY.

455
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I THINK THE FUNERAL IS GOING TO

456
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
BE ON FRIDAY.

457
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
SO WHETHER THE KIDS ARE GOING TO

458
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
GO TO FUNERALS OBVIOUSLY, AND

459
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GOING TO NEED

460
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
TO HAVE COUNSELORS ON SCENE.

461
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
THAT FIRST DAY FOR THE KIDS COME

462
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
BACK TO THAT SCHOOL.
>> SO TOUGH.

463
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
AND I'VE BEEN TOLD THEY'RE EVEN

464
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
TALKING TO TEACHERS ABOUT HOW TO

465
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
TALK TO STUDENTS ON THE FIRST

466
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
DAY BACK.

467
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
>> SURE.

468
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
>> IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS, IF

469
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
VIOLENCE IS BROUGHT UP OR

470
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
WHATEVER QUESTIONS MAY COME UP.

471
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
YOU KNOW, CHILDREN SEE AND KNOW

472
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
MORE THAN THEY GIVE OFF, YOU

473
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
KNOW.

474
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
THEY'RE VERY PERCEPTIVE,
ESPECIALLY AT THAT AGE.

475
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

476
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
TEACHERS, AND WE SAW IT WHEN WE

477
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
WERE DRIVING AROUND.
THEY SAID THAT CHALK HILL, THAT

478
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
MIDDLE SCHOOL WHERE THE SANDY

479
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
HOOK CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE

480
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
GOING, IT WILL LIKELY BE THE

481
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
MOST SECURE SCHOOL IN THE STATE.
AND THEY'RE VERY SERIOUS

482
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
ABOUT -- THERE IS POLICE PATROL

483
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
AT EVERY SCHOOL.

484
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
THEY SAID UNFORTUNATELY THAT MAY

485
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
NOW BE THE NEW NORMAL AS THEY'RE

486
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO
AND HOW TO PROTECT THEIR KIDS.

487
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
>> KATE, I APPRECIATE THAT

488
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
THANKS FOR ALL THAT LATEST

489
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
INFORMATION.

490
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
SADLY, THIS IS NOW THE LATEST

491
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
MASS SHOOTING TO BRING THE
COUNTRY TOGETHER IN GRIEF.

492
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
AND WHILE MANY AMERICANS ARE

493
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
STILL STRUGGLING TO GRASP THE
ENORMITY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN

494
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
NEWTOWN, OTHER FAMILIES ALREADY

495
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO FACE THIS
SORT OF NIGHTMARE.

496
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
WE THOUGHT IT WORTHWHILE TO TALK

497
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

498
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
BEEN THROUGH THIS KIND OF A

499
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
TRAGEDY BEFORE.

500
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
AND SADLY, THERE ARE MANY OF
THEM.

501
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
AMARDEEP KALEKA LOST HIS FATHER

502
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
AT THE SIKH TEMPLE SHOOTING IN

503
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
OAK CREEK, WISCONSIN IN

504
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
AUGUST.

505
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
WE TALKED TO AMARDEEP A LOT.

506
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
AND ROXANA GREEN LOST THEY ARE

507
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
DAUGHTER CHRISTINA TAYLOR GREEN

508
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
IN THE SHOOTING IN TUCSON,

509
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
ARIZONA, THAT
ALSO INJURED GABBY GIFFORDS

510
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO.

511
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
ROXANNA GREEN IS JOINING ME NOW.

512
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
AND AMARDEEP IS GOING TO BE

513
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
JOINING ME IN JUST A MOMENT.

514
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
ROXANNA, WHEN YOU HEARD THE

515
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
NEWS, WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?

516
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
IT MUST JUST ALL BRING IT BACK.

517
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
>> I WAS DEVASTATED.

518
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I WAS HEARTBROKEN FOR ALL THE

519
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
FAMILIES AND THE VICTIMS.

520
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
IT JUST BROUGHT IT ALL BACK TO

521
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
ME, AND I WAS VERY, VERY SAD.

522
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
>> LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A MIC
BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE HAVING AN

523
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
ISSUE HERE.

524
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
HOLD ON TO IT.

525
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
THERE ARE NOW SO MANY PARENTS

526
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
WHO ARE GOING THROUGH EXACTLY

527
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH.

528
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO THEM?

529
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I MEAN, IT'S A JOURNEY THAT
DOESN'T END, THIS JOURNEY OF

530
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
GRIEF.

531
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
>> WELL, ALL I CAN SAY IS TO DIG

532
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
DEEP WITHIN YOURSELF.

533
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
AND IF YOU'RE A PERSON OF FAITH,

534
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
JUST TO PRAY REALLY HARD AND

535
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
SURROUND YOURSELF WITH LOVED

536
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
ONES OR FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

537
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
AND THINGS WILL GET BETTER IN
TIME.

538
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S A PAIN

539
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
THAT NEVER GOES AWAY.

540
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I HAVE A HOLE IN MY HEART, AND I

541
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
WILL FOREVER.

542
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
BUT I'M JUST PRAYING FOR THEM,

543
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
THEY FIND SOME KIND OF PIECE.

544
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
PEACE.

545
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
>> AND I WANT TO BRING IN

546
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
AMARDEEP.

547
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
FOR YOU, YOUR LOSS WAS MORE

548
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
RECENT.

549
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
OBVIOUSLY, WHEN YOU HEARD OF

550
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
THIS, IT MUST HAVE ALL BROUGHT

551
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
IT BACK.

552
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
>> OH MY GOD, IT WAS SHOCKING.

553
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
WHEN WE HEARD IT, WE HAD A

554
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
TODDLER RUNNING AROUND THE
HOUSE.

555
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
AND WE JUST STARED AT HIM.
MY WIFE LOOKED AT ME.

556
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
SHE WORKS IN THE SCHOOLS.

557
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I WAS A FORMER TEACHER.

558
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
SHE GOES HE WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN

559
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
RAN.
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN SHOCK.

560
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
WE STARTED CRYING.
WE COULDN'T STOP.

561
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
>> WHAT IS IT LIKE WHEN THERE IS

562
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
A LOT OF FOCUS IN THE IMMEDIATE

563
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
DAYS AFTER THIS, BUT THEN

564
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
ULTIMATELY REPORTERS GO AWAY,

565
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
AND A LOT OF THE WELL-WISHERS

566
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
AND THE COUNSELORS GO AWAY.

567
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
AND THE REST OF THE WORLD SORT

568
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
OF KEEPS SPINNING, BUT YOUR

569
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
WORLD HAS STOPPED?

570
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I MEAN YOUR WORLD HAS COMPLETELY

571
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
CHANGED FOREVER.

572
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
HOW DO YOU COPE WITH THAT TIME

573
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
WHEN THE ADRENALINE FADES AWAY

574
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
AND THE REALITY SETS IN?

575
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
>> WELL, IN MY CASE, I WROTE A

576
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
BOOK, "AS GOOD AS SHE IMAGINED."

577
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I STARTED A FOUNDATION IN MY

578
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
DAUGHTER'S NAME.

579
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
SO I'VE BEEN REALLY, REALLY BUSY

580
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
WITH THAT IT TAKES UP A LOT OF
MY TIME.

581
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
AND JUST GIVING BACK TO LESS

582
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
FORTUNATE CHILDREN IN OUR

583
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
COMMUNITY BY BUILDING

584
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
PLAYGROUNDS AND HELPING OUT THE

585
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
SCHOOLS WITH SMARTBOARDS AND

586
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
P.E. EQUIPMENT.

587
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
THAT HAS BEEN THERAPEUTIC AND

588
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
HEALING.

589
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
>> AMARDEEP, WHAT CAN COME OUT
OF THIS?

590
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
WE'VE SEEN FAR TOO MANY OF THESE

591
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
KINDS OF THINGS.

592
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I KNOW YOU WANT SOMETHING TO

593
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
CHANGE.
SOMETHING'S GOT TO CHANGE.

594
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
>> I MEAN, THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE
HAS TO START.

595
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
ROXANNA AND I WITH MAYORS
AGAINST ILLEGAL GUNS.

596
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
AND WE JUST DID A WHOLE EVENT

597
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
WITH MAYOR BLOOMBERG THIS
MORNING OR THIS AFTERNOON.

598
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
AND, I MEAN, IT'S NOT JUST THE
GUNS THAT IS THE PROBLEM,

599
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
THOUGH.

600
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
AND IT'S BECOME LIKE A DEEP DOWN

601
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
ROOTED SOCIETAL ISSUE.

602
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
AND WE NEED TO KEEP THAT

603
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
CONVERSATION GOING.

604
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
AND FOR US, WE STARTED A

605
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
DOCUMENTARY CALLED NURSERY

606
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
CRIMES.

607
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
AND WE'RE GOING OUT OF OUR WAY

608
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
TO GO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS

609
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
HAPPENING AT A YOUNGER AND

610
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
YOUNGER AGE, AND HOW WE CAN FIND

611
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALMOST AT

612
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
THIS POINT OF SOCIOPATHY AND

613
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
THEN STOP IT AND BRING THEM

614
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
BACK.

615
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
>> THERE IS ALSO OBVIOUSLY

616
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH THAT

617
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.

618
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
IS THAT A CONCERN OF YOURS AS
WELL?

619
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY.

620
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
OUR SYSTEM HAS FAILED SO MANY

621
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
YOUNG PEOPLE.

622
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK CONGRESS

623
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS TO WORK
REALLY, REALLY HARD TO COME UP

624
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
WITH A, YOU KNOW, GUN VIOLENCE

625
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
PROTECTION PLAN AND A BETTER

626
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO THESE KIND

627
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
OF SENSELESS TRAGEDIES DON'T

628
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
HAPPEN.

629
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
>> IT SEEMS LIKE SO MANY EVEN

630
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
PARENTS WHO KNOW THEIR CHILDREN

631
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
HAVE AN ISSUE, OR KNOW THEIR

632
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
YOUNG KIDS IN THEIR 20s HAVE AN

633
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
ISSUE, THEY CAN'T GET HELP

634
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
UNLESS THAT CHILD IS PROVEN TO

635
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
BE VIOLENT OR A THREAT TO

636
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
THEMSELVES OR TO OTHERS.

637
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
>> I MEAN, IT'S SAD.

638
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
MOST OF THE TIME THE CHILD

639
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
ACTUALLY HAS TO COMMIT A CRIME

640
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
BEFORE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE
TO GET HELP.

641
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
AND A LOT OF TIMES MEDICAL

642
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY THAT HEY, I

643
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
CAN'T HELP THEM UNTIL THEY DO

644
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
SOMETHING X, Y, Z BAD.

645
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
AND THAT'S A BROKEN SYSTEM.

646
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
BECAUSE WE CAN SEE YOUNGER AND

647
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
YOUNGER KIDS DOING SMALL THINGS

648
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
THAT WOULD BE SOCIOPATHIC OR

649
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
ISOLATED.

650
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
AND WE CAN GET THEM TO CONVERT

651
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
OR REVERT.

652
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
>> WHAT HAS BEEN IT BEEN LIKE

653
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
FOR YOU JUST TO WALK AROUND THIS
TOWN AND TO SEE -- TO SEE THE

654
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
OUTPOURING OF -- PEOPLE JUST

655
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
WANT TO BE HERE AND HUG ONE

656
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
ANOTHER.
>> I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY

657
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
SPECIAL.

658
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
IT'S SO HEARTBREAKING WHAT
HAPPENED HERE.

659
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
IT'S JUST DEVASTATING.

660
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
BUT TO SEE ALL THE PEOPLE COME
TOGETHER, WE JUST KNOW THAT

661
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
THERE HAS TO BE CHANGE AND HOPE

662
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
WITH THAT.

663
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
>> I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU

664
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
TALKING.

665
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
YOU WANTED TO BE HERE, TOO.

666
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
YOU WERE WALKING AROUND TO SEE

667
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
THE MEMORIALS.

668
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

669
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE ALL THE

670
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
SUPPORT IN THE COMMUNITY TO COME
OUT.

671
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
AND IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE

672
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
THINGS THAT'S -- IT'S ONE THING
WHEN YOU LOOK AT A KID THAT

673
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
FALLS VICTIM TO THIS.

674
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
THEY CAN'T VOTE.

675
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
THEY CAN'T SIGN A PETITION.

676
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
THEY CAN'T GO OUT AND RALLY.

677
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
BUT IT'S US, THE ADULTS AT THIS

678
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
POINT IN TIME.

679
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I MEAN, WE JUST SAW 20 INNOCENT

680
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
LIVES TAKEN WITH NO POINT TO IT.

681
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
IT WAS PERVERTED BEYOND BELIEF.

682
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
AND IT'S UP TO US TO PROTECT
THOSE CHILDREN AND THE CHILDREN

683
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
THAT ARE UP TO COME, YOU KNOW.

684
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
>> AMARDEEP, I APPRECIATE YOU

685
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
BEING HERE.

686
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
THANK YOU.
ROXANNA, THANK YOU.

WE'RE HAVING SUCH A
GREAT YEAR ON THE GULF,

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
WE'VE DECIDED TO PUT
ASIDE OUR RIVALRY.

712
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME TO
VISIT ANYONE OF OUR STATES.

THE BEACHES AND WATERS
COULDN'T BE MORE BEAUTIFUL.

714
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
TAKE A BOAT RIDE, GO FISHING
OR JUST LAY IN THE SUN.

715
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
WE'VE GOT COASTLINE TO EXPLORE

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000

THE PICTURES ARE SO CLEAR.

00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
KEVIN'S A HANDSOME DEVIL

731
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
THAT PHONE DOES EVERYTHING!

732
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
SEARCH DOG TRICKS.

733
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
OKAY, SEE IF WE CAN TEACH
HIM SOMETHING COOL.

734
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
LOOK AT HOW LAZY KEVIN IS.

735
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
KEVIN, GET IT TOGETHER DUDE

736
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
CMON, KEVIN

737
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000

SHOT ON THE GALAXY S3.

738
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
>>> AS THE NEWTOWN COMMUNITY

739
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE TO MAKE

740
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
SENSE OF THIS TRAGEDY, IF THAT'S
AT ALL POSSIBLE, POLICE ARE

741
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
TRYING TO PUT THE PIECES

742
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT JUST

743
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
WHAT HAPPENED.
SUSAN CANDIOTTI IS HERE WITH THE

744
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
LATEST.

745
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
WHAT ARE WE LEARNING ABOUT THE

746
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
INVESTIGATION AT THIS POINT?

747
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
>> WELL, THE NEWEST PART ABOUT

748
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
THE INVESTIGATION, ANDERSON, IS

749
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
THAT IT TURNS OUT THE SUSPECTED

750
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
SHOOTER IN THIS CASE DID GO TO

751
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
GUN RANGES A NUMBER OF TIMES

752
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND

753
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
AS RECENTLY AS SIX MONTHS AGO.

754
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
NOW, HE MIGHT HAVE GONE MORE

755
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
RECENTLY THAN THAT, BUT THEY'RE

756
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
NOT THROUGH LOOKING AT ALL THE

757
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
GUN RANGES AND CONTACTING ALL OF

758
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
THEM TO FIND OUT ALL THE
INFORMATION.

759
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
>> DID HE GOOD ALONE?

760
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
>> WELL, THEY DID FIND EVIDENCE

761
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
THAT HE WENT AT LEAST ONCE WITH

762
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
HIS MOTHER.

763
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PROVE

764
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY WENT

765
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
TARGET SHOOTING TOGETHER AT THAT

766
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
GUN RANGE.

767
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
BUT THEY DID BOTH GO TOGETHER AT
LEAST ONCE.

768
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
>> AND HAVE THEY FOUND

769
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
INFORMATION AT HOME, ON
COMPUTERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT

770
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
THAT WE KNOW?

771
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
>> YEAH, THEY'VE BEEN EXAMINING

772
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
COMPUTERS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND
AT THE HOME.

773
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
AND OUR SOURCES TELL US THAT

774
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
THEY WEREN'T IN GOOD ORDER --

775
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
THEY WERE SMASHED TO

776
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
SMITHEREENS.
AND NOW THEY LITERALLY HAD TO

777
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
PICK UP THE PIECES, TAKE THEM TO

778
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
THE CRIME LAB.

779
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
AND NOW THEY'RE GOING THROUGH

780
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
EVERYTHING, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

781
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
WHAT WEBSITES HE VISITED, DID HE

782
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
TALK TO ANYBODY, WAS HE IN ANY

783
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
CHAT ROOMS, LEAVE ANY MESSAGES.

784
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
DID HE PLAY ANY VIDEO GAMES?

785
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT ALL THESE

786
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
THINGS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT.

787
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
AGAIN, IT'S ALL PART OF THE BIG

788
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
PICTURE HERE AND LOOKING FOR A

789
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
POSSIBLE MOTIVE.

790
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
>> AND AT THIS POINT, IS IT

791
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
KNOWN WHY THAT SCHOOL, WHY HE

792
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
PICKED THAT SCHOOL?

793
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
>> NO, IT ISN'T.

794
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
AND IN FACT, I TALKED WITH A

795
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
YOUNG MAN WHO WENT TO HIGH

796
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
SCHOOL WITH HIM, AND HE WENT

797
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
DOWN TO THE MEMORIAL TODAY
BECAUSE HE CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT

798
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
HAPPENED AND FEELS SO AWFUL FOR

799
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
THE CHILDREN.

800
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
BUT HE SAID THAT WHEN HE KNEW

801
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
HIM IN HIGH SCHOOL FOR ONE YEAR,

802
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
THEY WERE IN THE TECH CLUB
TOGETHER.

803
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
THEY LOVED PLAYING COMPUTERS.

804
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
HE LIKED PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.

805
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
AND HE MENTIONED TWO IN

806
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
PARTICULAR.

807
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
ONE CALLED "WARCRAFT III".

808
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
>> SURE.

809
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
>> ANOTHER ONE CALLED

810
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
"STARCRAFT."

811
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
AND IT INVOLVES SETTING UP AN

812
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
ENEMY CAMP AND YOU KILL THE
SOLDIERS AND ALL OF THIS.

813
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
HE SAID EVERYONE KNEW HE WAS

814
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
SOCIALLY AWKWARD, AND THAT HE

815
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
HAD SOME ISSUES GOING ON,

816
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
SOMETHING WITH HIS PERSONALITY.

817
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
BUT AS GUYS, THEY NEVER REALLY

818
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
TALKED ABOUT IT.

819
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
>> AND THEY'RE DOING A COMPLETE

820
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
LOOK AT THE WEAPONS THAT HE HAD
ACCESS TO?

821
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

822
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
AS WE KNOW, HE CAME ARMED TO THE

823
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
HILT, OFFICIALS SAY.

824
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
NOT ONLY DID HE COME WITH THAT

825
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
HIGH CAPACITY MILITARY

826
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
ASSAULT-STYLE WEAPON AND THOSE

827
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
TWO HANDGUNS, BUT HE HAD

828
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
30-ROUND MAGAZINES FOR EACH OF

829
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
THEM, AND SEVERAL OF THEM FOR

830
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
EACH OF THEM, PLUS EXTRA AMMO ON

831
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
TOP OF THAT.

832
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
AND THEY'RE TRACING THE COMPLETE

833
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
HISTORY OF HOW OFTEN HE USED

834
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
THOSE GUNS, MAYBE WHERE HE USED

835
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
THE GUNS.

836
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
MAYBE HE USED SOME OF THOSE AT

837
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
THE GUN RANGE.

838
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
BUT WE DON'T KNOW.

839
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
>> IS THERE ANY MORE INFORMATION

840
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
ABOUT THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER?

841
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
>> THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER.

842
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
WELL, WE'RE FINDING OUT A LITTLE

843
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
BIT MORE ABOUT HER DIVORCE,

844
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
THROUGH DIVORCE PAPERS, FOR

845
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
EXAMPLE.

846
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
SHE WAS GETTING ALIMONY FROM HER

847
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
HUSBAND, ABOUT $290,000 A YEAR,

848
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
$24,000 A MONTH.

849
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
THE MARRIAGE BROKEN DOWN BECAUSE

850
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
OF IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES.

851
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
AND THAT HE WAS TO BUY A CAR FOR

852
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
HIS SON AND HIS EX-WIFE WAS TO

853
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MORTGAGE.

854
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
>> IS THAT PRETTY MUCH ALL AT

855
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
THIS POINT?
>> YEAH.

856
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I MEAN, THEY'RE STILL LOOKING

857
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
FOR THE MOTIVE AND TRYING TO

858
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
TALK TO FAMILY, TO FRIENDS TO

859
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
TRY TO PAINT A PICTURE OF WHAT

860
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
HE WAS ALL ABOUT.

861
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
THERE IS SOME TALK FROM ONE

862
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
RELATIVE THAT NANCY LANZA --

863
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
WELL, EVERYONE DESCRIBES HER

864
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
MORE AS A GUN COLLECT EITHER

865
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
THIS POINT.

866
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING OTHER

867
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
THAN THAT, ANY PROOF OF ANYTHING

868
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
ELSE RIGHT NOW.

869
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
BUT SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE

870
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
ECONOMY, BUT THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE THAT IT WENT BEYOND

871
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
THAT, YOU KNOW.

872
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
>> RIGHT.

873
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
>> WHY SHE WAS COLLECTING THESE

874
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
GUNS.
>> RIGHT.
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, I APPRECIATE

LATEST ON THAT.

878
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
SAME QUESTION WHY, WHY DID THIS

879
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
HAPPEN.

880
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
WHAT LEADS SOMEONE DOWN TO GUN

881
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
DOWN COMPLETE STRANGERS?

882
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000

US?

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE GRUELING

913
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
PROCESS OF THE FUNERALS, IT'S

914
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
VERY, VERY, VERY HARD.

915
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
EVERYONE USES THE WORD HOLLOW.

916
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW.
>> WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

917
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
FOCUS ON THE VICTIMS OF FRIDAY'S

918
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
SHOOTING.

919
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
WE'RE GOING BRING YOU JUST A

920
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
LITTLE BIT OF MY INTERVIEW WITH

921
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
THE McDONNELL FAMILY, WHOSE

922
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
DAUGHTER GRACE WAS KILLED ON
FRIDAY.

923
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THE WHOLE
INTERVIEW FOR YOU TOMORROW

924
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
NIGHT.

925
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
BUT WE'LL PLAY JUST A LITTLE BIT

926
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
A LITTLE BIT LATER ON TO HONOR

927
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
GRACE, AMAZING GRACE, AS WE

928
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
TALKED ABOUT IN THE INTERVIEW.

929
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
BUT THERE ARE MANY UNANSWERED
QUESTIONS THAT INVOLVES THIS

930
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
KILLER.

931
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
WHY TARGET AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

932
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
WHY THIS SCHOOL?

933
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
WHY DID HE MURDER 20 FIRST

934
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
GRADERS, LITTLE KIDS JUST 6 AND

935
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
7 YEARS OLD, YOUNG ENOUGH TO

936
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS AND THE

937
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
TOOTH FAIRY.

938
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
AS WE SAID EARLIER TODAY,

939
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
AUTHORITIES ARE EXAMINING A

940
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
COMPUTER SMASHED IN THE GUNMAN'S
HOME.

941
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI SPOKE ABOUT

942
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
THAT.

943
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT CONTAIN SOME

944
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
CLUES.
INVESTIGATORS MAY NEVER FIGURE

945
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

946
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
SADLY, THOUGH, THERE IS A BODY

947
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
OF RESEARCH ON THESE KIND OF

948
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
KILLERS, ON MASS MURDERERS, AND

949
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
THE COMMON GROUND THEY MAY

950
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
SHARE.

951
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
DR. SANJAY GUPTA JOINS ME.

952
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
HE HAS BEEN LOOKING INTO THAT.

953
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
YOU'VE BEEN RESEARCHING

954
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
COMMONALITIES.

955
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
WHAT ARE THEY?
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND?

956
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
>> ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT

957
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
THESE MEDICAL INVESTIGATORS,
FORENSIC INVESTIGATORS WILL DO

958
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
IS TRY AND FIGURE OUTDO THEY FIT

959
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
A PARTICULAR TYPE.

960
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
AND THEY ALMOST ALWAYS DO, WHICH

961
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
IS INTERESTING.

962
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THERE ARE TYPICALLY THREE TYPES

963
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.
SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY HAS

964
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
PSYCHOTIC TENDENCIES, SOMEONE

965
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
WHO HAS PSYCHOPATHIC TENDENCIES,

966
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
OR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN HEAVILY

967
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
TRAUMATIZED IN YOUTH.

968
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
JARED LOUGHNER, FOR EXAMPLE,

969
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
SOMEBODY WE REPORTED ON QUITE A

970
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
BIT.

971
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
HE CLEARLY HAD PSYCHOTIC

972
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
TENDENCIES.

973
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
AND ONE OF THE COLUMBINE KILLERS

974
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
HAD CLEAR CLUES DATING BACK OF

975
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
PSYCHOPATHIC TENDENCIES.

976
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
HE HAD SADISTIC BEHAVIOR.

977
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
HE HAD BEEN DELINQUENT WITH HIS
PARENTS QUITE A BIT.

978
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER

979
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
THIS, ANDERSON, BUT HE WAS

980
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
LAUGHING AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS

981
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
ACTUALLY COMMITTING THESE
MURDERS AT COLUMBINE HIGH

982
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
SCHOOL.

983
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
THE POINT IS THAT HARDLY ANYONE

984
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
EVER REALLY JUST SNAPS.

985
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT
IN THESE SITUATIONS.

986
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
BUT THE REAL POINT HERE IS THAT

987
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
WERE THERE SOME CLUES?

988
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
AND THERE ALMOST ALWAYS IS.

989
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
>> THAT NOTION OF JUST SNAPPING,

990
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
THAT DOESN'T REALLY TURN OUT TO

991
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
BE THE CASE, THAT USUALLY THERE

992
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
ARE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY --

993
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
SOMETIMES I'VE HEARD -- THERE

994
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
WAS A SECRET SERVICE REPORT DONE

995
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
THAT THEY ACTUALLY TALKED TO
OTHER KIDS, OTHER PEOPLE WHAT

996
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
THEY'RE GOING TO DO.

997
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
>> AND IF THEY DO THAT, A VERY

998
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
IMPORTANT POINT, IF THEY

999
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
ACTUALLY TALK TO SOMEONE AS

1000
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
OPPOSED TO BEING ISOLATED, IT IS

1001
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
A GREAT INHIBITOR OF CARRYING

1002
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
OUT THE ACTIVITY.

1003
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
ONCE YOU START TO TALK TO OTHER

1004
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
PEOPLE, EITHER BECAUSE THEY TALK

1005
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
YOU OUT OF IT, OR YOU YOURSELF

1006
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
GET SOME GREATER CONTEXT OF WHAT

1007
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
IT IS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT

1008
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
ALMOST ALWAYS INHIBITS THE
ACTIVITY.

1009
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH A

1010
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
LOVED ONE AND OTHER PEOPLE IN

1011
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
THE SCHOOL.

1012
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
COLUMBINE WAS UNUSUAL THAT WAY

1013
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
BECAUSE THERE WAS TWO PEOPLE
TOGETHER.

1014
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
BUT ALMOST ALWAYS IT IS A SINGLE

1015
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
PERSON WHO HAS NOT DISCUSSED

1016
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
THIS PLAN WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

1017
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
>> YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE

1018
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

1019
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
ARE A LOT OF THEM ON MEDICATION,
OFF MEDICATION?

1020
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
>> THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING.

1021
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
ALMOST ALL OF THEM WERE ON SOME
TYPE OF MEDICATION.

1022
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
AND IF YOU DIG A LITTLE BIT DEEP

1023
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
WITH THAT, WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT

1024
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
THERE IS A VULNERABLE PERIOD.

1025
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
IT IS WHEN SOMEONE IS STARTING

1026
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
MEDICATIONS OR WHEN THEY'RE

1027
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
GOING OFF.

1028
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
AND TYPICALLY THEY'RE
ANTIDEPRESSANTS.

1029
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
NOT ALL PSYCHOTROPIC
MEDICATIONS.

1030
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
AT THAT POINT WHEN THEY'RE
EITHER GOING ON OR GOING OFF,

1031
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
THEY CAN BE A GREAT BENEFIT, BUT

1032
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
YOU CAN HAVE INCREASED

1033
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
IMPULSIVENESS, DECREASED

1034
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
JUDGMENT AND LOSS OF TOUCH WITH
REALITY.

1035
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
THOSE ARE THE THREE SYMPTOMS

1036
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
THAT THEY DESCRIBED TO ME.

1037
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
AND REMEMBER, ANDERSON, THEY

1038
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
SHOULD BE MONITORED AT THAT

1039
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
TIME.

1040
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
BUT IN A MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM

1041
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
THE WAY IT IS NOW, THEY GET THE

1042
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
PRESCRIPTION, AND HARDLY ANY

1043
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
FOLLOW-UP.

1044
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
>> DOCTORS HAVE TOLD ME THAT IF

1045
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
YOU ARE ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND

1046
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
YOU JUST STOP, THAT YOU SHOULD

1047
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
NOT JUST STOP.

1048
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
YOU REALLY NEED TO BE UNDER
SUPERVISION AND TAPER OFF.

1049
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1050
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
>> AND IT SEEMS LIKE SOME OF

1051
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
THESE PEOPLE DIDN'T.

1052
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
>> NO.
AND YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE

1053
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
MONITORING NOTION INVOLVES

1054
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
BUILDING TRUST WITH A

1055
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
PSYCHIATRIST, BEING ABLE TO CALL

1056
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
THAT PERSON, NOT SIMPLY GETTING

1057
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
A PRESCRIPTION.

1058
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
AND, YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T TO

1059
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
INDICT THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

1060
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
BUT IT'S BASICALLY SAYING THERE

1061
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
IS NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES.

1062
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
THEY CAN BARELY SEE THE PEOPLE

1063
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
THAT THEY NEED TO SEE.

1064
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
THIS IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO

1065
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
MONITOR THEM, AGAIN, AT THESE

1066
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
VULNERABLE PERIODS, IT'S NOT

1067
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
HAPPENING.

1068
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I TALKED TO SEVERAL OF THEM.

1069
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
THIS IS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING
FOR THEM.

1070
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
>> ALSO OVER THE YEARS THERE HAS

1071
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE

1072
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
RIGHTS OF THE PATIENT,

1073
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
UNDERSTANDABLY, BECAUSE THERE

1074
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
WERE ABUSES BEFORE.

1075
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I GUESS I WONDER, HAS IT GONE
TOO FAR?

1076
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I'VE HEARD FROM PARENTS WHO SAY
THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TROUBLES

1077
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
WITH A CHILD OR WITH EVEN AN

1078
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
ADULT CHILD, BUT THEY CAN'T DO

1079
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
SOMETHING UNLESS THAT PERSON HAS

1080
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
COMMITTED A CRIME OR IS PROVEN

1081
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
TO BE DANGEROUS.

1082
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1083
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
IMMINENT THREAT TO THEMSELVES OR
TO OTHERS.

1084
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
WHAT AN UNBELIEVABLE STANDARD.
THINK ABOUT IT.

1085
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
IT'S LIKE SAYING YOU WOULD HAVE

1086
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
TO BE HAVING A HEART ATTACK TO

1087
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
BE TREATED FOR YOUR HEART

1088
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
DISEASE.
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

1089
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING WE

1090
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
THINK OF AS DOCTORS.

1091
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
THE OTHER OPTION IS BASICALLY TO
PUT THEM INTO THE CRIMINAL

1092
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
JUSTICE SYSTEM.
AND NOW YOU'RE ASKING PARENTS TO

1093
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
ESSENTIALLY CREATE A POLICE

1094
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
RECORD FOR YOUR CHILD.

1095
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
>> AND FRANKLY, THAT IS THE

1096
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
REALITY THAT IS HAPPENING.

1097
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I MEAN, OUR PRISONS ARE FULL OF

1098
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL ISSUES.

1099
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1100
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
PEOPLE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THIS

1101
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
NOTION THAT FAMILIES ARE DENYING

1102
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
THE SYMPTOMS, IGNORING THEM.

1103
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
THAT COULD BE HAPPENING, BUT THE

1104
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
PEOPLE I TALK TO, THAT'S NOT THE

1105
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
CASE.
THESE FAMILIES, THEY ANGUISH

1106
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
OVER WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH

1107
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
THEIR CHILDREN.

1108
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD OPTIONS.

1109
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
EVEN IF THEY GET THE MEDS, THEY

1110
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
ARE TO BE MONITORED, ESPECIALLY

1111
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
WHEN GOING ON AND OFF.

1112
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
AND THEY DON'T GET THAT.

1113
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
THERE ARE SO MANY POTENTIAL

1114
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
BREAKDOWNS IN THE SYSTEM.

1115
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
THESE ARE FIXABLE PROBLEMS.

1116
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
BUT IT'S NOT WORKING THE WAY IT.

1117
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
>> AND THERE JUST NEEDS TO BE A

1118
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
WILL AND A CONTINUED DISCUSSION.

1119
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
OFTEN WE DISCUSS THESE THINGS IN
THE MEDIA IN THE WAKE OF

1120
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND STOP,

1121
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
AND NOTHING EVER CHANGES.

1122
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
SANJAY, I APPRECIATE THE REPORT.

1123
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT

1124
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
MASS SHOOTERS ARE LONER THAT IS

1125
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
SNAP AND GO ON KILLING SPREES.

1126
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
IN HER BOOK "RAMPAGE: THE SOCIAL

1127
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
ROOTS OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS,"

1128
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
KATHERINE NEWMAN SAYS IT'S NOT

1129
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
THAT SIMPLE, NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

1130
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
SHE HAS DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH

1131
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
ON SCHOOL SHOOTINGS.

1132
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING BACK ON
THE PROGRAM.

1133
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
YOU'VE STUDIED RAMPAGE SHOOTINGS

1134
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
LIKE THE ONE DATING BACK TO THE

1135
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
1970s.

1136
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
YOU SAY THERE ARE A LOT OF MYTHS

1137
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
ABOUT THEM.

1138
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
TALK TO ME ABOUT SOME OF THE

1139
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
MYTHS.

1140
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
>> ONE OF THE MYTHS IS THE IDEA

1141
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
THAT PEOPLE SNAP.

1142
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
BUT WE FOUND THAT SOMETIMES THEY
PLAN THESE THINGS AS MUCH AS

1143
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
NINE MONTHS IN ADVANCE.

1144
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
ANOTHER MYTH IS THAT THEY ARE

1145
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
LONERS.
THEY'RE VERY RARELY LONERS, BUT

1146
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT OF

1147
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
TROUBLE IN THEIR SOCIAL

1148
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
INTERACTIONS THERE IS FRICTION
ALL AROUND THEM.

1149
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I HAVE TO SAY CONTRARY TO WHAT

1150
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT, IN

1151
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
THE CASE OF THE SHOOTERS WE
LOOKED AT, THEY WERE ALMOST

1152
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
NEVER DIAGNOSED OR UNDER

1153
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
TREATMENT.

1154
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
AND SO THEY'RE OFTEN PEOPLE WHO
ARE COMPLETELY MISSED BY THE

1155
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

1156
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
AND WE FIND OUT ABOUT THEIR
MENTAL DISORDERS IN FORENSIC

1157
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
SEGMENTS AFTER THE FACT.

1158
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
WE ALSO DISCOVER THAT THEY TELL

1159
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
PEOPLE A LOT ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE

1160
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
PLANNING TO DO, BUT THEY DO SO

1161
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
IN A WAY THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT

1162
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
TO INTERPRET.

1163
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
THEY SAY THINGS THAT ARE RATHER
VEILED AND CONFUSING.

1164
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
AND BECAUSE WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO

1165
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
IS SO OUTLANDISH AND SO

1166
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
INCONCEIVABLE, THE PEOPLE AROUND

1167
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
THEM DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO

1168
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
INTERPRET WHAT THEY'VE HEARD.

1169
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
SO THEY GET A LOT OF INFORMATION

1170
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
CIRCULATING, BUT THAT DOESN'T

1171
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
COME TO THE ADULTS WHO MIGHT BE

1172
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
ABLE TO INTERVENE BECAUSE THE

1173
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
KIDS HAVE A HARD TIME

1174
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
INTERPRETING EXACTLY WHAT THOSE
VEILED WARNINGS MEAN.

1175
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
>> I MEAN, WE SEEM TO SEE MOSTLY
MALES, YOUNG MALES COMMITTING

1176
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
THESE HORRIBLE CRIMES.

1177
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
IS THERE -- IS THERE A REASON

1178
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
WHY THAT IS?

1179
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
>> WELL, GIRLS DO OTHER THINGS,

1180
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT ARE
DAMAGING TO THEMSELVES.

1181
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
BUT THEY TEND TO BE TURNING

1182
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
INWARD, WHERE AS BOYS TEND TO BE

1183
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
EXPLODING OUTWARD.

1184
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
AND THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE

1185
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
IMAGES THAT THEY RECEIVE IN

1186
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
POPULAR CULTURE, WHICH LIONIZE

1187
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
THIS KIND OF VIOLENCE.

1188
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
OBVIOUSLY NOT AGAINST CHILDREN,

1189
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
BUT THE TRENCH COAT MAFIA, THE

1190
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
SORT OF GUNMAN IS A FIGURE WE
RECOGNIZE.

1191
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
AND FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THESE

1192
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
VERY MARGINAL BOYS, IT LOOKS

1193
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
MORE APPEALING THAN THE DWEEBIE
LONER MISFIT.

1194
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
AND SO WHAT THEY'RE SEEKING TO
DO MOST OF THE TIME IS SOLVE A

1195
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
PROBLEM.

1196
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
AND THE PROBLEM IS THEY DON'T

1197
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
LIKE THE WAY OTHER PEOPLE

1198
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
PERCEIVE THEM, AND THEY WANT TO

1199
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
CHANGE IT.

1200
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
AND WHEN THEY START TALKING

1201
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
ABOUT SHOOTING PEOPLE, ALL OF

1202
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
THE SUDDEN THOSE PEER GROUPS

1203
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
START PAYING ATTENTION TO THEM.

1204
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
AND NOW THEY'VE MADE A
COMMITMENT OR PROMISE WHAT

1205
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
THEY'RE GOING TO DO, AND THEY

1206
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
FIND THEY CAN'T BACK DOWN OUT OF

1207
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
IT OR IT WOULD BE ONE MORE

1208
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
SOCIAL FAILURE.

1209
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
>> THAT'S INTERESTING.

1210
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
SO IN SOME CASES, ACTUALLY
TALKING ABOUT IT, HAVING SAID

1211
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
SOMETHING TO OTHERS, IT KIND OF

1212
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
BUILDS UP THE MOMENTUM OR THE

1213
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
PRESSURE FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY

1214
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
ACT OUT ON IT?

1215
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
>> IT DOES, ANDERSON.

1216
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I MEAN, THEY'RE USUALLY QUITE
AMBIVALENT ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE

1217
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
GOING TO DO.

1218
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
BUT WHAT PUSHES THEM PAST THE
AMBIVALENCE IS THE POSSIBILITY

1219
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE ONE MORE

1220
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
COMPLETE SOCIAL DISASTER IN

1221
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
WHICH THEY'VE MADE PROMISES, AND

1222
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
NOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FULFILL

1223
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
THEM, AND EVERYBODY IS GOING TO
BE LAUGHING AT THEM NOW.

1224
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
AND IT IS AMAZING HOW MUCH THAT

1225
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
MOTIVATE THIS IS BEHAVIOR.

1226
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT HOW
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL PEOPLE OR

1227
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
DESTROY A TOWN.

1228
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW OTHER
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE THEM

1229
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
DIFFERENTLY.

1230
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
LOOK AT THE PICTURES OF THE

1231
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
SHOOTER IN THE VIRGINIA TECH
CASE.

1232
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
THERE HE WAS WITH GUNS BLAZING

1233
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
AND A FLAK JACKET, AND HE LOOKS

1234
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
LIKE RAMBO.

1235
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
WELL, THAT LOOKS A LOT BETTER TO
HIM, I'M SORRY TO SAY THAN THE

1236
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
DWEEBIE IMAGE OF THE REJECT AND

1237
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
MISFIT.

1238
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
>> AND JUST VERY BRIEFLY,

1239
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
POLITICIANS TALK VIDEO GAMES.

1240
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
DOES THAT -- HAVE YOU SEEN ANY
LINK?

1241
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
>> THERE IS A LINK, ANDERSON,
BUT IT'S NOT THE LINK WE USUALLY

1242
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
THINK OF.

1243
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
OFTEN PEOPLE THINK THAT VIDEO

1244
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
GAMES WILL SOMEHOW INSPIRE

1245
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
PEOPLE TO FEEL RAGE AND GO OUT

1246
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
AND ENACT IT.

1247
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
INSTEAD, WHAT WE SAW WAS THAT

1248
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
VIDEO GAMES JUST LIKE FILMS

1249
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
PRESENT AN IMAGE OF MASCULINITY

1250
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
THAT IS TIED TO VIOLENCE, AND

1251
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
SORT OF GLAMORIZES IT, AND MAKES

1252
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
THESE BOYS WHO DON'T FEEL VERY

1253
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
GLAMOROUS THAT IF THEY CAN JUST

1254
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
DO THAT, OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING

1255
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
TO TURN AROUND AND LOOK AT THEM

1256
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
DIFFERENTLY.

1257
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
RATHER THAN INSPIRING A KIND OF

1258
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
BOILING RAGE, WHAT IT DOES IS

1259
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
PRESENT AN IMAGE OF HOW A

1260
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
MASCULINE BOY, YOU KNOW, COULD

1261
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
ACT AND BE NOTICED.
>> RIGHT.

1262
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
INTERESTING.

1263
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
KATHERINE NEWMAN, I APPRECIATE

1264
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
YOU BEING ON.

1265
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
WE'LL TALK TO YOU AGAIN.

1266
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
