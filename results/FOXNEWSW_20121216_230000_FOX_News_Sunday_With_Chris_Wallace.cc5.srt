TALK WHETHER IT IS GUN CRIMINAL

106

ISSUE THAT HAS POPPED UP.

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
HE WILL AVOID THAT TONIGHT.

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
AS YOU MENTIONED, THE MAYOR

112

REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING SECOND

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
AMENDMENT IS A CHERISHED RIGHT.

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
THE BOTTOM LINE FROM THE WHITE

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
HOUSE AIDES IS THE PRESIDENT

120
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000

THERE WILL AN GREAT DEBATE IN

123

THE DAYS AHEAD.

124
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
HE SET HIGH EXPECTATION ON

125
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
FRIDAY WHEN HE SAID HE WANTS

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
MEANINGFUL ACT AND HE WILL FACE

127
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
PRESSURE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000

>>Reporter: ABSOLUTELY.

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
IN TUCSON, HE GAVE REPORTS FOR

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND

135
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
INDEPENDENTS SAYING HE SPOKE FOR

136
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
AN ENTIRE NATION.

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
IT WASN'T JUST SPEAKING FOR

138
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
DEMOCRATS.

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
SAME AFTER AURORA HE MET THE

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
VICTIMS IN THE HOSPITAL, FOLKS

141
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
WHO SURVIVED THAT SHOOTING AT

142
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000

143
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
AGAIN, HE IS GOING THROUGH THIS

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
AND THAT IS WHY HE WILL FACE

145
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
TREASURE IN THE SECOND TERM TO

146
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
ACT.

147
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
>>Bret: THANK YOU, ED.

148
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000

151
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000

BROUGHT SMILES AND LIT UP ROOMS

153
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000

STUDENTS FROM GUNFIRE.

156
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
AND OTHERS WHOSE ACTIONS LIKELY

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
SAVED LIKES.

158
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000

>> CHRIS WALLACE THIS MORNING

192
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH A

193
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
FATHER WHOSE CHILD SURVIVED THE

194
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
MASSACRE.
AND HIS SON WAS INSIDE WHEN THE

195
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
GUNMAN CAME IN A CLASSROOM AND

196
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
SHOT THE LITTLE BOY'S TEACHER.

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

198
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
>> THE CHILDREN WITNESSED THE

199
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
SHOOTER COME TO THE ROOM, SHOOT

200
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
THE TEACHER AND CONTINUE FIRING,

201
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
THE CHILDREN ACTED ON INSTINCT

202
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
AND WHAT THEY WERE TAUGHT WHICH

203
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
WAS TO RUN AND THEY DID.

204
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
THEY RAN TO THE MAIN ROAD 100

205
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
YARDS AWAY.

206
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
MY SON AND SEVERAL OF THE OTHER

207
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
STUDENTS WERE EXTREMELY BRAVE IN

208
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
WHAT THEY DID.

209
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
>>Reporter: SO MANY PARENTS

210
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
HAVE THE RELIEF IF THEIR CHILD

211
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
MADE IT HOME BUT IT IS

212
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
BITTERSWEET BECAUSE OTHER

213
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
PARENTS ARE SUFFERING SO GREAT

214
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
GREATLY.

215
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
>>Bret: THANK YOU, MOLLY.

216
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
AS THE COMMUNITY STRUGGLES TO

217
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
DEVELOP, STORIES OF HEROICKISM

218
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
ARE STARTING TO EMERGE,

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
INCLUDING THAT OF SCHOOL

220
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
PRINCIPAL DAWN HOCHSPRUNG,

221
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
LURCHING AT THE SHOOTER.

222
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL'S FRIENDS

223
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
IS NOT SURPRISED, BECAUSE SHE

224
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
TRAINED IF A SITUATION SIMILAR

225
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
TO WHAT UNFOLDED.

226
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
>> SHE KNEW THE HEALTH AND

227
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
SAFETY OF HER CHILDREN WERE

228
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
PARAMOUNT.

229
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
SHE ACTUALLY SAVED A GREAT MANY

230
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
LIVES BY TAKING HER ACTION.

231
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THE SHOOTER HAD THE CAPABILITY

232
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
OF SHOOTING MORE AND THE TRAGEDY

233
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR WORSE IF NOT

234
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
FOR HER HOUR -- REACTIONS.

235
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
WE DID NOT THINK THIS WOULD

236
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
BECOME REALITY.
SHE IS TRULY A HERO TODAY.

237
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
>>Gregg: WE HEAR THAT

238
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
PRINCIPAL HOCHSPRUNG IMPLEMENTED

239
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
NEW SECURITY MEASURES AT THE

240
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
SCHOOL INCLUDING CHECKING THE

241
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I.D. OF VISITORS NOT RECOGNIZED

242
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
BY STAFF.

243
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
NOW OUR PANEL WHO WILL BE WITH

244
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
US THROUGHOUT THE EVENING,

245
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
SENIOR WRITER FOR THE WEEKLY

246
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
STANDARD, STEVEN HAYES, AND NINA

247
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
AND CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.

248
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
THESE ARE TOUGH TO LISTEN TO.

249
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
CHARLES, WE HAVE LISTENED TO

250
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
THIS A FEW DAYS AND THIS IS THE

251
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
CHALLENGE OF THE PRESIDENT AS HE

252
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
IS READY FOR THE RARE SERVICE.

253
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
ANY THOUGHTS?

254
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
>>Reporter: YOU HAVE A HUMAN

255
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
TRAGEDY AND THE FAMILY

256
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
TRAGEDIES, COMMUNITY TRAGEDY AND

257
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
THEN A NATIONAL TRAGEDY BECAUSE

258
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
OF THE WAY THE NEWS IS SPREAD.

259
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
THE PRESIDENT'S ROLE IS TO TRY

260
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
TO CRYSTALLIZE THAT.

261
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I AM GLAD TO HEAR FROM ED HENRY

262
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
THIS IS NOT A TIME TO SPEAK

263
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
ABOUT POLITICS.

264
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
THERE IS SOMETHING OBSCENE ABOUT

265
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
JUMPING IN AT A TIME OF GREAT

266
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
NATIONAL GRIEF AND IN SOME WAYS

267
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
DISORIENTATION WITH A PROGRAM OF

268
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
POLITICAL ACTION BEFORE THE DEAD

269
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
ARE EVEN INTERRED.

270
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
SOME DECENCY REQUIRES PEOPLE

271
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
SHOULD AT LEAST STEP BACK, WAIT

272
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
FOR THE EMOTIONS TO PASS, NOT

273
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
THAT YOU CAN'T DO ANALYSIS AND

274
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
TRY TO THINK THROUGH WHAT IS

275
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
BEHIND WHAT MIGHT HAVE

276
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
CONTRIBUTED, BUT, BEFORE PEOPLE

277
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
ENACT AGENDAS THEY SHOULD ALLOW

278
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
THE MOURNING TO TAKE PLACE.

279
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
>> THIS IS, REALLY, A

280
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
CONSOLER-IN-CHIEF ROLE FOR

281
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

282
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
THAT COMMUNITY...WE HAVE JUST

283
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
SCRATCHED THE SURFACE OF SOME OF

284
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
THE STORIES AND JUST SEEING THE

285
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
PICTURES.
>>Guest: HE IS PARENT IN CHIEF

286
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
TONIGHT.

287
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I HAVE A CHILD IN ELEMENTARY

288
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
SCHOOL AND I GOT A CALL A FEW

289
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
DAYS AGO AND IT WAS A LOCKDOWN

290
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
DRILL, THEY DO A RECORDED CALL

291
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
AND CALL BACK AND TELL YOU IT IS

292
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
A DRILL.
A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER, WINTER

293
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
CONCERT, CHRISTMAS CONCERT, AND

294
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
AFTER, THE PRINCIPAL SAID TO ALL

295
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
OF US PARENTS GATHERED, THESE

296
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
WERE PRE-K AND KINDERGARTEN, I

297
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ENTRUSTING

298
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
YOUR CHILDREN TO US.

299
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
TWO HOURS LATER I HEAR THE NEWS

300
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
AND ALL OF THE WORDS TOOK ON

301
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
MORE MEANING, MORE HORRIFIC

302
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
MEANING THAN YOU COULD IMAGINE.

303
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
NOW THE PRESIDENT IS

304
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
CONSOLER-IN-CHIEF, PARENT IN

305
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
CHIEF, BUT AT SOME POINT WHEN

306
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
YOU LOOK AT SIX-YEAR-OLD BODIES

307
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
RIDDLED WITH MULTIPLE BULLETS WE

308
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
HAVE TO START LOOKING FOR WAYS

309
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
TO TAKE THE WORD "MASS" OUT OF

310
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
MASS MURDER.

311
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I HOPE HE WILL MOVE FORWARD TO

312
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
DO SOME SORT OF INDEPENDENT

313
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
COMMISSION THAT HAS THE URGENCY

314
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
WE HAD AFTER 9/11.

315
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
>> THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE SENSE

316
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
WHEN YOU THINK OF ED HENRY

317
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
TALKING ABOUT AURORA, TUCSON,

318
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
AND THIS KEEPS HAPPENING BUT

319
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
THIS SITUATION IS DIFFERENT AND

320
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
SO MUCH WORSE BECAUSE OF WHAT WE

321
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
ARE SEEING, THE PICTURES OF THE

322
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
INNOCENT HELPLESS CHILDREN.

323
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I HAVE A SIX-YEAR OLD NIECE, MY

324
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
BROTHER IS A TEACHER, YOU LOOK

325
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
AT THESE SITUATIONS AND IT IS

326
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
JUST SO HORRIFYING AND YOU

327
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
WONDER HOW PEOPLE CAN COVER FROM

328
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
IT.
THE PRESIDENT, I DON'T ENVY HIM

329
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
TO HAVE TO COME BEFORE THESE

330
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
PEOPLE AND GIVE THEM SOME SORT

331
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
OF CONSOLATION TO BE ABLE TO

332
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
MOVE ON.

333
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
>>Bret: THERE IS SO MUCH WE

334
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
DON'T KNOW, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW

335
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
THIS SHOOTER'S CONNECTION TO THE

336
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
SCHOOL.

337
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
WE DON'T KNOW THE MOTHER'S

338
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
CONNECTION AND SHE IS A VICTIM.

339
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
SHE IS THE 27th VICTIM.

340
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
THERE IS SO MUCH WE DON'T KNOW.

341
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
>> IT IS A REASON THAT SO MUCH

342
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
OF THE DISCUSSION OVER THE

343
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
WEEKEND AND IN SOME SENSE THE

344
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
POLITICIZING OF THIS IS

345
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
REGRETTABLE.
IF YOU GO BACK AND PICK UP ON

346
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
WHAT THE OTHERS HAVE SAID, YOU

347
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
LOOK AT THE PRESIDENT'S ROLE,

348
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
AND SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT AGREE

349
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
WITH THE PRESIDENT VERY OFTEN ON

350
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
POLICY, WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

351
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
DONE WELL IS GIVEN SPEECHES AND

352
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER IN

353
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
TIMES LIKE THIS.

354
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I STILL THINK THE SPEECH HE GAVE

355
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
FOR THE MEMORIAL FOR GABRIELLE

356
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
GIFFORDS WAS THE BET SPEECH --

357
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
BEST SPEECH OF HIS PRESIDENCY

358
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
AND IT TOOK COURAGE TO AVOID THE

359
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
PRESSURE TO GET POLITICAL

360
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
QUICKLY.

361
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
LIKE CHARLES SAID I AM GLAD TO

362
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
HEAR IT SOUNDS LIKE HE WILL NOT

363
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
DO THAT.

364
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
IT IS FINE TO HAVE A COMMISSION

365
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
AND LOOK INTO THIS.

366
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
IF WE DIDN'T AS A NATION ASK

367
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
TOUGH QUESTIONS AFTER AN EVENTS

368
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
LIKE THIS I DON'T THINK WE WOULD

369
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
BE MUCH OF A NATION.

370
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THOSE

371
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
DISCUSSIONS.
I HOPE HE DOES WHAT HE HAS DONE

372
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
IN THE PAST AND PLAY THE ROLE AS

373
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
CONSOLER-IN-CHIEF AND TALK TO

391
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Sometimes what we suffer from

392
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Is bigger than we think ...
like the flu.

393
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
With aches, fever and chills-
the flu's a really big deal.

394
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So why treat it like
it's a little cold?

395
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
There's something
that works differently

396
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
than over-the-counter
remedies.

397
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Prescription TAMIFLU attacks
the flu virus at its source.

398
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000

If you develop an allergic
reaction, a severe rash,

406
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
or signs of unusual behavior,

407
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000

mild to moderate nausea
and vomiting.

413
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The flu comes on fast,

414
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
so ask your
doctor about TAMIFLU.

415
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Prescription for flu.

00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
WITH MORE.

738
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
STEVE?

739
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
>> HEAR IN WASHINGTON, DC, SHOCK

740
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
AND SADNESS, BUT, ALSO, A NEW

741
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
DETERMINATION TO LOOK AT ALL THE

742
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
POSSIBLE WAYS ANOTHER TRAGEDY

743
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
COULD BE PREVENTED.

744
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
OUTGOING SENATOR JOE LIEBERMAN,

745
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
AN INDEPENDENT FROM CONNECTICUT,

746
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
HAD THIS OBSERVATION ABOUT GUN

747
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
CONTROL.
>> THE SAME FOR DEMOCRATS,

748
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPENDENTS,

749
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
TO ACKNOWLEDGE TWO THINGS: ONE,

750
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
THE STRONGEST CONCEIVABLE GUN

751
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
CONTROL LAWS WILL NOT STOP ALL

752
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
ACTS OF VIOLENCE.

753
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
BUT, ALSO, KNOWLEDGE THAT THE

754
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
STRONGER OUR GUN CONTROL LAWS

755
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
ARE, THE FEWER ACTS VIOLENCE

756
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
INCLUDING MASS VIOLENCE, WILL

757
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
HAPPEN IN OUR SOCIETY.

758
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
>> HE GOES FURTHER AND PROPOSE

759
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
AS NATIONAL COMMISSION, AND

760
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
SENATOR DURBIN EXPRESSED

761
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
SUPPORT.

762
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
TOM RIDGE SERVED ON A STATE

763
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE

764
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
VIRGINIA TECH SHOOTINGS FIVE

765
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
YEARS AGO AND SAID THIS IS A

766
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
COMPLEX PROBLEM THAT NEEDS

767
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
CAREFUL ATTENTION.

768
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
>> THERE ARE MULTIPLE PLAYERS

769
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
HERE TOMORROW HAVE A SERIOUS

770
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
CONVERSATION ABOUT REDUCING THE

771
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
RISK OF THIS HAPPENING, WE HAVE

772
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
TO START DEALING WITH ALL THE

773
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
LAYERS.
IT IS ABOUT LIFECY, AND MENTAL

774
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
HEALTH CANCELING AND GETTING THE

775
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
PEOPLE THE HELP THEY NEED AT THE

776
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
OUTSET.
>> ALSO TURNING THE SPOT LIGHT

777
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
ON MENTAL HEALTH SCREENING AND

778
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
ON CULTURAL ISSUES.

779
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
SENATOR LIEBERMAN AND REPUBLICAN

780
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
CONGRESSMAN FROM UTAH BOTH

781
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
SUGGESTING TODAY THAT THE MASS

782
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
MEDIA INCLUDING VIOLENT VIDEO

783
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
GAMES NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE

784
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
IMPRESSIONABLE TEEN BOYS AND

785
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
SOME CALL TODAY FOR TOUGHER

786
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
REGULATIONS INCLUDING A BAN ON

787
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS.

788
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
>>Bret: THANK YOU, STEVE.

789
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
NOW, BRINGING BACK OUR PANEL,

790
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
SENIOR WRITER FOR THE WEEKLY

791
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
STANDARD, STEVEN STEPHEN HAYESSD

792
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.

793
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
WE TALK ABOUT THIS EARLIER,

794
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
STEVE, AND SOME CALLED FOR GUN

795
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
CONTROL, TODAY, AND YOU HEARD

796
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
SOME TALKING ABOUT MENTAL

797
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
ILLNESS AND HOW BIG A PROBLEM

798
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
THAT IS AND BEING LOOKED AT.

799
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
POLICY-WISE, BEYOND THIS SPEECH

800
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
TONIGHT, BECAUSE ED IS SAYING

801
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
THAT, REALLY, THAT IS NOT THE

802
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
FOCUS.

803
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
WHERE DOES THIS GO?

804
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
>> WE WILL HAVE A BIG DEBATE

805
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL.

806
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
WE HAVE SEEN THAT TAKING PLACE.

807
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
PEOPLE LIKE BLOOMBERG HAS HAD

808
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
THIS FOR A CAUSE A GOOD MANY

809
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
YEARS.
I DO HOPE WE ALSO HAVE A

810
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
SUSTAINED DEBATE ABOUT CIVIL

811
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
COMMITMENT AND HOW WE DEAL WITH

812
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
MENTAL ILLNESS.

813
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
IT IS VERY CLEAR WHEN YOU LOOK

814
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
BACK AT THE SERIES OF SHOOTINGS

815
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
WE HAVE HAD, OUR SOCIETY HAS BIG

816
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
QUESTIONS TO ANSWER ON HOW TO

817
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
DEAL WITH THE MENTALLY ILL AND

818
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
DANGEROUSLY MENTALLY ILL, THE

819
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
PEOPLE, WHERE THERE IS A SOCIETY

820
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
THAT DOES NOT WANT TO CATEGORIZE

821
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
PEOPLE OR COMMIT PEOPLE BUT

822
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
CLEARLY WHAT WE ARE DOING IS NOT

823
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
WORKING.

824
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
THAT HAS TO BE PART OF THIS

825
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
BROADER DISCUSSION.

826
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
>>Bret: THERE WAS AN AMAZING

827
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
PIECE ON TWITTER, "I AM ADAM

828
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
LANZA'S MOTHER" WRITTEN BY A

829
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
MOTHER WHO DESCRIBED IN VERY

830
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
GREAT DETAIL HAVING A SON WHO

831
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
THREATENED HER AND SHE HAD TO

832
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
DEAL WITH IT.

833
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
IF YOU HAVE NOT READ IT IT IS

834
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
WORTH READING.

835
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
IT IS ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS AND

836
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
HOW SHE ESSENTIALLY SAYS THAT NO

837
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
ONE WOULD TAKE HER SERIOUSLY

838
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
UNLESS HER CHILD HAD A CRIMINAL

839
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
RECORD.

840
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
>> THAT IS TRAGEDY.

841
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
MANY YEARS AGO I WOULD COMMIT

842
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR WILL FOR

843
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
THE MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL

844
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
HOSPITAL TO STATE HOSPITALS IF

845
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
THEY WERE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES

846
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
OR OTHERS.

847
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
IT IS HADDER TO DO AND NOT

848
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
SOMETHING ANY PSYCHIATRIST DOES

849
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
LIGHTLY BUT THE DILEMMA FOR A

850
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
PARENT, YOU ARE IN THE TERRIBLE

851
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
RELATIONSHIPS, THING OF

852
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
LOUGHNER, FROM SUE -- SUE --

853
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
FROM TUCSON, EVERYONE KNEW HE

854
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
WAS NOT WELL AND KNEW HE WAS

855
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
DANGEROUS.
ONE STUDENT FLED THE CLASS IF HE

856
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
WAS THERE, SHE SAT IN THE BACK

857
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
SO SHE COULD ESCAPE.

858
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
YOU HAVE A PARENT WHO KNOWS THIS

859
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
IS GOING ON AND IS TOLD BY THE

860
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
AUTHORITIES BECAUSE OF THE RISE

861
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
OF CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE

862
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
EXPERIENCE WE HAD IN THE 50'S OF

863
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
THE ABUSE OF INCARCERATION OF

864
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
MENTALLY ILL, IT BECOMES

865
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
IMPOSSIBLE AND THEY SAY TO A

866
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
PARENT UNLESS HE DOES SOMETHING

867
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
OUR HANDS ARE TIED.

868
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
THAT IS A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

869
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
THE PARENTS ARE CAUGHT IN AN

870
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION.

871
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
IT IS NOT UNTIL THE LOUGHNERS

872
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
COMMIT THE ATROCITY THAT THE

873
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
STATE STEPS IN AND IN HIS CASE

874
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
IT WAS OBVIOUS FROM THE MOMENT

875
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
THIS HAPPENED.

876
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
WE DO NOT KNOW ABOUT ADAM LANZA

877
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
BUT IT IS A PICTURE OF A

878
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
WITHDRAWN AND POSSIBLY AUTISTIC

879
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
CHILD, WITH VIDEO GAMES AND HELP

880
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
CLOSED IN HIS WORD, A PARENT

881
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
LIVING ALONE WITH HIP, OBVIOUSLY

882
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
UNABLE TO COPE WITH THE TERRIBLE

883
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
TRAGEDY HAPPENS.

884
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
WHAT IS THE FIRST THING HE DOES

885
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
ON THE HORRIBLE DAY?

886
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
HE KILLS HIS MOTHER.

887
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE I

888
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
EMPATHIZE WITH EVERY PARENT OR

889
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
RELATIVE.

890
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
WHERE DO YOU TURN UNDER THE

891
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
COUNTRY LAWS?

892
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
>>Bret: THE ASSOCIATE PRESS IS

893
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
QUOTING THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL

894
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
AND TOBACCO AND FIREARMS SAYING

895
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
ADAM LANZA HAD BEEN VISITING A

896
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
LOCAL SHOOTING RANGE BUT THEY DO

897
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
NOT KNOW IF HE PRACTICED THERE

898
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
BUT THEY KNOW HIS MOTHER VISITED

899
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
THE SHOOTING RANGES SEVERAL

900
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
TIMES, WHETHER SHE TOOK HIM

901
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
THERE TO PRACTICE WITH HER, THEY

902
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
ARE THOUGHT SAYING, BUT HE DID

903
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
GO THERE.

904
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
SO THE QUOTE, AGAIN, WE JUST

905
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH.

906
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
WE KNOW THAT HE TOOK HER GUNS TO

907
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
DO THIS CRIME.

908
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
>>Guest: SHE WAS A GUN

909
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
COLLECTOR AND WENT TO THE

910
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
SHOOTING RANGE WITH

911
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

912
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE

913
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
MOVE FORWARD IN THIS, WHAT

914
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
CHARLES BRINGS UP IS ABSOLUTELY

915
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
RIGHT, IT IS VERY HARD FOR A

916
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
PARENT TO COMMIT A CHILD AND IT

917
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
IS CLEAR FROM THE PAST MASS

918
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
KILLINGS THERE WERE WARNING

919
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
SIGNS AND WE MAY FIND THAT OUT

920
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
NOW.
THE OTHER COMPONENT IS THE RISE

921
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
AND PROLIFERATION OF

922
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS WHICH ARE

AND MOTORISTS OVER TAKEN BY

1109
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000

A LONGER LOOK TODAY AND OTHERS

1111
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000

ART TEACHER AND HE SAYS HE

1116
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THE VICTIMS

1117
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
THAT DIED, BUT FELT COMPELLED

1118
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
TO DO SOMETHING AND THE SAME

1119
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
GRIEF REALLY FELT IN EVERY

1120
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
CORNER.

1121
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
UNITED STATES AND THOUSANDS OF

1122
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
MILES AWAY IN SOUTHERN

1123
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
CALIFORNIA, MOURNERS THERE

1124
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
HOLDING A PRAYER SERVICE TO

1125
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
REMEMBER THE INNOCENT LIVES

1126
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
LOST AND THEIR FAMILIES NOW

1127
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
DEALING WITH THE TRAGEDY.

1128
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
>> THE OTHER ADMINISTRATORS

1129
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
WHO WENT TOWARDS HIM AND TRIED

1130
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
TO PROTECT THE KIDS, THAT JUST

1131
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
GETS ME, CATCHES ME.

1132
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
>> I WOKE UP AT LIKE 1:30 THIS

1133
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
MORNING WITH A PIECE OF

1134
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
SCRIPTURE GOING THROUGH MY

1135
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
HEAD FROM JEREMIAH, AND RACHEL

1136
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
WEEPING AND WINNER WITH HER NO

1137
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
MORE AND I WOKE UP CRYING AND

1138
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
COULDN'T STOP CRYING AND

1139
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
THOUGHT YOU KNOW, OTHER PEOPLE

1140
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
NEED TO CRY, TOO.

1141
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
>> OUR PANEL IS BACK WITH US

1142
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
NOW.

1143
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
YOU KNOW, WE'VE TALKED A

1144
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
LITTLE ABOUT THE POLICIES

1145
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
SURROUNDING ALL OF THIS, BUT

1146
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
YOU KNOW, DEALING WITH IT,

1147
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
CHARLES, HAS BEEN FRANKLY

1148
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
TOUGH FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.

1149
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
>> WELL, IT'S VERY HARD.

1150
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
WE HAVE THE MASS MEDIA AND

1151
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
EVER SINCE THE KENNEDY

1152
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
ASSASSINATION WHEN THESE

1153
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
THINGS HAPPEN WE BECOME A

1154
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
COMMUNITY.
THAT WAS THE REALLY THE FIRST

1155
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
TIME WE NATIONALLY MOURNED AND

1156
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO.

1157
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT

1158
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
HAPPENING AT THE COMMUNITY

1159
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
LEVEL, AT THE FAMILY LEVEL,

1160
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
THERE ARE THESE MENTAL HEALTH

1161
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
EXPERTS WHO GO IN AND THEY

1162
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
COUNSEL AND I THINK THEY DO AN

1163
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
EXTRAORDINARY JOB.

1164
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
BUT IN THE END WE REALLY COME

1165
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
UP AGAINST THAT QUESTION THAT

1166
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
YOU ASKED THE RABBI EARLIER IN

1167
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
THE SHOW FOR THESE, I MEAN,

1168
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
THE MOST PROFOUND EXPLANATIONS

1169
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
ARE OFTEN THE MOST, OR

1170
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
THEOLOGICAL AND WE REALLY

1171
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
DON'T HAVE VERY GOOD

1172
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
THEOLOGICAL EXPLANATIONS, IT'S

1173
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
CALLED THE PROBLEM OF THE

1174
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
PRESENCE OF EVIL AND THE

1175
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
PRESENCE OF GOD, ALL LOVING

1176
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
GOD.

1177
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
AS HUMANS, WE REALLY DON'T.

1178
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
WHEN YOU ASK HOW DO YOU

1179
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
COUNSEL PEOPLE, THERE'S REALLY

1180
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
NOTHING ONE CAN OFFER IN THE

1181
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
WAY OF EXPLANATION, OTHER THAN

1182
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
LOVE AND PROTECTION, REALLY.

1183
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
>> AND IT'S ALSO TOUGH TO --

1184
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
IT'S TOUGH TO DO YOUR JOB WHEN

1185
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
YOU'RE THERE AS A FIRST

1186
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
RESPONDER, TO RESPOND TO

1187
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

1188
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT'S TOUGH

1189
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
TO BE A MEDIA PERSON, BUT IT

1190
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
IS TO COVER SOMETHING LIKE

1191
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
THIS WHEN YOU'RE ON THE GROUND

1192
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
AND TRY TO GET THE STORY, TO

1193
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
BRING IT OUT TO PEOPLE.

1194
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,

1195
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
DON'T LIKE REPORTERS BECAUSE

1196
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
THEY'RE ASKING PEOPLE

1197
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
QUESTIONS AND SAYING, YOU

1198
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
KNOW, WILL YOU TALK TO US.

1199
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
ONE OF THE FATHERS DID TALK TO

1200
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
THE CAMERAS TODAY AND CHOSE TO

1201
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
DO SO AND HERE IS WHAT HE HAD

1202
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
TO SAY.
>> SHE NEVER MISSED AN

1203
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
OPPORTUNITY TO DRAW A PICTURE

1204
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
OR MAKE A CARD FOR THOSE

1205
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
AROUND HER.

1206
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF

1207
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
TIMES EMILIE NOTICED SOMEONE

1208
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
FEELING SAD AND RUSHED TO FIND

1209
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
PAPER AND DRAW A PICTURE OR

1210
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
ENCOURAGING NOTES.

1211
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
AND HER LAUGHTER WAS

1212
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
INFECTIOUS AND ALL THOSE WHO

1213
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
HAD THE PLEASURE TO MEET HER,

1214
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
THIS WORLD IS A BETTER PLACE

1215
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN IN IT.

1216
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
>> AND THERE'S AN INSTANCE TO

1217
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
SAY GET OUT OF HERE, DROP THIS

1218
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
STORY AND LEAVE THEM ALONE.

1219
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
AND THEN THERE'S THIS OTHER

1220
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
INSTINCT THAT THERE'S THIS

1221
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
HEALING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

1222
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
AND THIS PRAYER SERVICE

1223
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
TONIGHT IS PART OF IT.

1224
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
>> WE'RE GOING TO HEAR MORE

1225
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
STORIES LIKE THAT, AND MORE

1226
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
PARENTS TALK AND IT'S SO HARD

1227
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
TO LISTEN TO THAT FATHER

1228
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
WITHOUT CHOKING UP.

1229
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
AND WHAT BOTHERS ME, I

1230
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
REMEMBER COLUMBINE AND PAIN

1231
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
WHEN THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED

1232
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
IN COLORADO AND I VIVIDLY

1233
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
REMEMBER VIRGINIA TECH, WAS

1234
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
EVEN BIGGER FATALITY-WISE AND

1235
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
MORE KIDS DIED AND WE HAVE

1236
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
THIS LIKE TROUBLING SHORT-TERM

1237
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
MEMORY IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE

1238
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
WE FIXATE ON THIS FOR A

1239
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF

1240
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
TIME AND THEN WE MOVE ON.

1241
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
SO I HOPE THOSE PARENTS COMING

1242
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
FORWARD NOW AND TALKING ABOUT

1243
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
THESE SMALL CHILDREN WILL

1244
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
ACTUALLY PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF

1245
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
TIPPING POINT, SOME LEVEL OF

1246
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
MOVEMENT, SOME LEVEL OF FOCUS

1247
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
ON OUR COUNTRY TO AT LEAST

1248
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
START THE CONVERSATION AND

1249
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
HAVE A COMMISSION TO LOOK AT

1250
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
THIS AND TRY TO TAKE ACTION

1251
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
AND NOT JUST THROW UP OUR

1252
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
HANDS AND WAIT FOR THE NEXT

1253
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
ONE TO HAPPEN.

1254
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
>> AND I ALSO THINK THAT YOU

1255
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
LOOK AT THE CHILDREN AP IT'S

1256
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
SO INCREDIBLY TRAGIC, THE

1257
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
PICTURE THAT WE BUMPED IN AND

1258
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
THE PICTURE WAS ICONIC, THE

1259
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
WOMAN SOBBING IN THE PARKING

1260
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
LOT THAT'S ACTUALLY THE SISTER

1261
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
OF VICTORIA SOTTO, WHO WAS THE

1262
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
TEACHER WHO SAVED SOME OF HER

1263
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
CHIL
