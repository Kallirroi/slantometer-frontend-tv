SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THAT

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
ANYONE WHO NEEDS HELP FROM THIS

CHURCH, THEY CAN COME HERE AND

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
GET IT.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
TALKING TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
HERE, THEY SAY THIS SQUARE,

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
SOLEDAD, NEVER THIS BUSY ON A
SATURDAY NIGHT.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
MANY OF THESE PEOPLE JUST COMING

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
>> EMOTIONALLY DEALING WITH THAT

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
AND THEN ON THE INVESTIGATIVE

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000

DON?

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
FROM NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, I'M

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000

TONIGHT.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
THIS IS THE SMALL TOWN WHERE

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
THIS CRIME SHOCKED THE ENTIRE

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
NATION JUST ONE DAY AGO.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
POLICE TONIGHT ARE STILL COMBING

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL EVERY

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
CRACK AND CREVICE.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
THOSE ARE THEIR WORDS, OF THE

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE A GUNMAN

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
SHOT 26 PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM 6

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
THEY'RE ALSO AT THE HOME OF THE

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
MAN IDENTIFIED AS THE SHOOTER,

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
TRYING TO LEARN ANY CLUES THEY

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
CAN ABOUT WHY HE DID WHAT HE

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
DID, WHY THIS SCHOOL IN

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
PARTICULAR.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL BE HERE

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
THE SIX ADULTS KILLED IN THE

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
SCHOOL.

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
ALSO TALKING TO FIRST RESPONDERS

WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THOSE

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
YOUNG VICTIMS TONIGHT, THOSE 12

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
GIRLS AND EIGHT LITTLE BOYS SHOT

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
DEAD IN THEIR CLASSROOMS.

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
MOST OF WHAT WE'RE LEARNING IS

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
FROM THEIR PARENTS WHO ARE

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
SHARING THEIR GRIEF VERY

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
PUBLICLY TONIGHT.

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
KYUNG, YOU WERE THERE EARLIER

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
WHEN THE FATHER OF EMILIE PARKER

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
CAME OUT OF HIS HOUSE AND WANTED

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
TO TELL PEOPLE, WANTED TO TALK

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
TO TV CAMERAS AND JUST TALK IN A

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
VERY HUMAN WAY ABOUT HIS

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
DAUGHTER, ABOUT WHAT SHE WAS

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
LIKE, ABOUT THE LIFE SHE LIVED.

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
>> AND HE WAS VERY CLEAR THAT

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
THE REASON HE WANTED TO COME OUT

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
AND FACE CAMERAS -- HE KNOWS

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
THIS IS NATIONAL TELEVISION, HE

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY KNEW THAT HE

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU AND HE

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
ALSO WANTED TO SHARE A MESSAGE,

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
THAT WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS,

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
THAT SOCIETY CANNOT BE DEFINED

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
BY THIS SINGLE ACT.

81
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
HE LOST A 6-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
AND IT'S ONE THING TO THINK

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
ABOUT THE NUMBER.

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
TO WATCH THIS MAN TALK, TO LOOK

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
AT THE PICTURES OF THP BEAUTIFUL

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
GIRL AND TO FULLY COMPREHEND

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
THAT THIS FAMILY HAS SUFFERED A

89
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
TRUE, TRUE LOSS.

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD US.

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
>> I WAS LEAVING TO WORK, AND

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
SHE WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT.

93
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
AND I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TEACHING

94
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
HER PORTUGUESE.

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
SO OUR LAST CONVERSATION WAS IN
PORTUGUESE.

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING.

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
AND ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
AND I SAID THAT I WAS DOING
WELL.

99
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME AND I

100
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT
THE DOOR.

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

104
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
WAS AND HOW MANY LIVES THAT SHE

106
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
WAS ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
TIME HERE ON EARTH.

108
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
VERY LOVING.

110
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
MY DAUGHTER EMILIE WOULD BE ONE

111
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE STANDING

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
AND GIVING HER LOVE AND SUPPORT

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS BECAUSE

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
THAT'S THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT

115
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
SHE IS, NOT BECAUSE OF ANY

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
PARENTING THAT MY WIFE AND I

117
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
COULD HAVE DONE BUT BECAUSE

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
THOSE WERE THE GIFTS THAT WERE

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
GIVEN TO HER BY HER HEAVENLY
FATHER.

120
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
>> AND HE ALSO SAID THAT HE WAS

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
VERY PROUD TO BE HER FATHER,

122
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE THE BEST

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
FATHER HE COULD TO HIS TWO

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
REMAINING CHILDREN, A 3-YEAR-OLD

125
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
AND A 4-YEAR-OLD GIRL, HER

126
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
SISTERS.

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
HE DID ALSO SAY THAT HE WANTED

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
TO MAKE SURE THAT HE EXTENDED

129
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
HIS CONDOLENCES TO THE SHOOTER'S

130
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
FAMILY BECAUSE THEY ALSO

131
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
SUFFERED A LOSS, ANDERSON.

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
AND THE THING THAT'S REALLY

133
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
EXTRAORDINARY IS HOW HE'S ABLE
TO GET HIS MESSAGE OUT AND STILL

134
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
KEEP IT TOGETHER.

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
IT'S REALLY -- IT'S HARD TO

136
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
WATCH AND TO COMPREHEND.

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
>> HOW DOES A FATHER TELL A 3

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
AND A 4-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER THAT

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THEIR SISTER, THEIR BIG SISTER

140
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
IS GONE?

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE.

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
KYUNG LAH, APPRECIATE YOU
REPORTING TONIGHT.

143
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
RESIDENTS OF STRATFORD,

144
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
CONNECTICUT, REMEMBER VICTORIA
SOTO WHO GREW UP THERE.

145
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
SHE WAS 27 YEARS OLD.

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
SHE TAUGHT FIRST GRADE AT SANDY

147
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY.

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THEY WERE WEARING THOSE COLORS

149
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
BECAUSE THAT WAS HER FAVORITE

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
COLOR, GREEN.

151
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
JASON CARROLL JOINS ME NOW, MORE
ON THE VIGIL.

152
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
SOUNDS AS THOUGH THE COMMUNITY

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
REALLY ADORED THAT TEACHER AND

154
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
TONIGHT WANTED TO KIND OF SHOW

155
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
THAT IN A VERY PUBLIC WAY.

156
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
>> YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGTD,

157
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
ANDERSON.

158
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED

159
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
HERE TONIGHT.

160
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
THE FAMILY SAYING THAT IT

161
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
BASICALLY ALL STARTED ON

162
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
FACEBOOK WITH A FACEBOOK

163
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
MESSAGE, LET'S GET TOGETHER,

164
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
LET'S FIND OUT A WAY TO HONOR

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
VICTORIA, VICKI, AS HER FAMILY

166
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
AND TRENDS CALLED HER.

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
VICTORIA SOTO.

168
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
THAT'S WHAT THEY DID.

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
THEY CAME OUT HERE TONIGHT IN

170
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
FRONT OF HER HIGH SCHOOL.

171
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
THIS IS WHERE EVERYONE KNEW HER.

172
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT HER

173
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
SAYING SHE WANTED TO BE A

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
TEACHER EVER SINCE SHE WAS A

175
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
LITTLE GIRL AND THEY TALKED

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
ABOUT HOW DEDICATED THIS YOUNG

177
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
WOMAN WAS TO HER STUDENTS.

178
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
IN FACT, SHE DIDN'T EVEN REFER

179
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
TO THEM AS STUDENTS.

180
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
SHE ALWAYS REFERRED TO THEM AS

181
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
HER KIDS, HER CHILDREN.

182
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
AND OUT HERE TONIGHT, AS YOU CAN

183
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
IMAGINE WITH HER SISTER BEING

184
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
HERE, HER BROTHER BEING HERE,

185
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
HER PARENTS BEING HERE, HER

COUSIN HERE AS WELL, AS EVERYONE

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
GATHERED TOGETHER AND HUGGED

188
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
EACH OTHER, THEY STRUGGLED TO

189
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
FIND WAYS TO REMEMBER HER.

190
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I SPOKE TO ONE YOUNG WOMAN WHO

191
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
KNEW VICKI SOTA THROUGHOUT HER

192
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
ENTIRE LIFE.

193
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
LISTEN TO HOW SHE SPOKE ABOUT
HER TONIGHT.

194
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
>> SHE WAS ALWAYS AT THE HOUSE

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
SMILING.
SHE DROVE US TO CHEERLEADING

196
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
PRACTICES A COUPLE OF TIMES.

197
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'M ALSO A TEACHER AND I CAN'T

198
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
EVEN IMAGINE GOING THROUGH WHAT

199
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
SHE WENT THROUGH.

200
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I THINK HER PUTTING HERSELF OUT

201
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
THERE -- SHE'S JUST AN ANGEL AND

202
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
SHE JUST WENT STRAIGHT INTO

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
HEAVEN.
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

204
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
>> AS YOU CAN SEE, ANDERSON,

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN EMOTIONAL

206
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
STRUGGLE FOR SO MANY PEOPLE OUT

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
HERE TONIGHT.

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
AT ONE MOMENT, CARLEY SOTO,

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
SHE'S 19 YEARS OLD, SHE STOOD IN

210
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
FRONT OF THE SEVERAL HUNDRED

211
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
PEOPLE WHO GATHERED OUT HERE

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
TONIGHT AND SHE SPOKE JUST

213
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
BRIEFLY, JUST FOR A MOMENT SHE

214
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
REMINDED THE AUDIENCE TO HUG

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
YOUR LOVED ONES BECAUSE YOU JUST

216
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'RE EVER

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
GOING TO SEE THEM AGAIN.

218
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
IT WAS A VERY POWERFUL MOMENT AS

219
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
THE FAMILY PAID TRIBUTE TO A

220
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
WOMAN WHO THEY SAY WAS A

221
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
DEDICATED TEACHER, A LOVING

222
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
DAUGHTER AND SOMEONE WHO LOVED

223
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
HER CHILDREN OR HER STUDENTS.

224
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
ANDERSON?

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
>> ONE FAMILY SAYS THEY OWE

226
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
THEIR SON'S LIFE TO VICKI SOTO.

227
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THEY SPOKE WITH KATE BOLDUAN

228
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
ABOUT THEIR CHILD'S ORDEAL

229
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
YESTERDAY AND HOW SHE'S COPING

230
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
WITH WHAT HE'S SEEN.

231
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
>> ROBERT AND DIANE LIKATA HAD

232
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
TWO CHILDREN AT THAT ELEMENTARY

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
SCHOOL YESTERDAY, A

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
SECOND-GRADER AND THEIR SON IN

235
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
FIRST GRADE WHO THEY SAY IT IS A

236
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
MIRACLE HE MADE IT OUT ALIVE
AFTER COMING FACE TO FACE WITH

237
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
THE SHOOTER.

238
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
>> THAT'S WHEN THEY HEARD NOISES

239
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
THAT THEY INITIALLY THOUGHT WERE
HAMMERS FALLING.

240
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
THEN THEY REALIZED THAT IT WAS

241
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
GUNSHOTS.

242
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
AND MS. SOTO, WHO WAS ADEN'S

243
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
TEACHER, HAD THE PRESENCE OF

244
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
MIND TO MOVE ALL THE CHILDREN TO

245
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
A DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE DOOR

246
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROOM FURTHEST

247
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
AWAY FROM THE DOOR.

248
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
THAT'S WHEN THE GUNMAN BURST IN,

249
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
DID NOT SAY A WORD, NO FACIAL

250
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
EXPRESSIONS, AND PROCEEDED TO
SHOOT THEIR TEACHER.

251
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
AND THEY BASICALLY RAN RIGHT

252
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
NEXT TO THE GUY AND OUT THE

253
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
DOOR.

254
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
>> THEY RAN PAST THE GUNMAN.

255
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
>> THEY RAN PAST THE GUY.

256
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
HE'S STILL STANDING IN THE DOOR

257
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
AND THEY RAN PAST HIM AND RAN

258
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
DOWN THE HALLWAY AND THEY'RE ONE

259
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
OF THE CLOSEST ROOMS TO THE MAIN
ENTRANCE.

260
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
AND ADEN WAS -- HAD THE PRESENCE

261
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
OF MIND TO HOLD THE DOOR FOR ONE

262
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
OF HIS CLASSMATES.

263
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE OF HIS
CLASSMATES THAT WAS A LITTLE

264
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
BEHIND.

265
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
WAITED FOR HIM AND THEY RAN OUT

266
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
TO THE MAIN ROAD.

267
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
>> WE KNOW HIS TEACHER,

268
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
VICTORIA SOTO, DIED IN THAT

269
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
CLASSROOM TRYING TO PROTECT HER

270
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
STUDENTS.
HE KNOWS HIS TEACHER WAS SHOT.

271
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
DO YOU THINK HE KNOWS THAT SHE

272
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
LIKELY DID NOT MAKE IT?

273
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
>> HE KEEPS ASKING ABOUT HER.

274
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I THINK HE'S REASSURING HIMSELF

275
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

276
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
HE REALLY, REALLY CARED ABOUT

277
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
HIS TEACHER.

278
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
HE WAS VERY CLOSE WITH HER.

279
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
AND SHE REALLY LOVED THAT CLASS.

280
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
AND HE KEEPS SAYING, I REALLY

281
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
HOPE SHE'S OKAY, I HOPE IT'S NOT

282
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
HER.

283
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
HE KNOWS THAT SHE'S BEEN HURT

284
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW THE END

285
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
RESULT.

286
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
HE KNOWS THE KIDS THAT HE SAW

287
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
GETTING SHOT.

288
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE OUTCOME.

289
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
SO I THINK HE'S REASSURING
HIMSELF IN HIS 6-YEAR-OLD MIND.

290
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I KNOW HE'S PROCESSING IT.

291
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
BUT I THINK HE'S REASSURING

292
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
HIMSELF.

293
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I THINK HE'S TELLING HIMSELF

294
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

295
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
WE HAD TO PUT THE SIGN OUT IN

296
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
THE FRONT TODAY ASKING PEOPLE

297
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
NOT TO RING THE DOORBELL BECAUSE

298
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
HE STILL HASN'T INTERNALIZED THE

299
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
FACT THAT THIS GUNMAN, THIS BAD

300
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
GUY IS GONE.

301
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
AND HE WANTS TO KNOW IF THERE

302
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
ARE MORE BAD GUYS IN THE WORLD.

303
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER

304
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
THAT QUESTION PROPERLY AND SO

305
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
WHEN SOMEONE RINGS THE DOORBELL,

306
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
HE THINKS IT'S HIM COMING

307
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
BACK -- COMING FOR HIM.

308
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
AND SO HE -- SO I THINK OUR

309
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
BIGGEST CONCERN NOW IS MAKING

310
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
SURE THAT WE HANDLE HIS

311
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
SENSITIVE NATURE PROPERLY AND

312
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
CAREFULLY AND SUPPORT HIM AND

313
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
SUPPORT OUR DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE

314
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
AGAIN DOES PROCESS THINGS VERY

315
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
DIFFERENTLY THAN HE DOES.

316
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
SO THAT'S OUR JOB AS PARENTS NOW

317
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
IS TO STAY CLOSE TO THEM, HOLD

318
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
THEM, HUG THEM, LOVE THEM AND

319
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE
SAFE.

320
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
>> THEY DID NOT WANT THEIR

321
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
CHILDREN TO BE PART OF THE
INTERVIEW.

322
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
BUT I DID SPEND TIME WITH THEM

323
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
THIS MORNING.

324
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
AND ADEN AND HIS SISTER, THEY

325
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
SEEMED IN HIGH SPIRITS.

326
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
BUT CLEARLY SHAKEN.

327
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
AND AS HARD AS IT HAS BEEN FOR

328
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
THIS FAMILY, THEY SAY THAT THEIR

329
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
HEARTS GO OUT TO THE SO MANY

330
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
OTHER FAMILIES WHO CANNOT GO

331
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
HOME AND HUG THEIR CHILDREN

332
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
TONIGHT.

333
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
ANDERSON?

334
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
>> KATE THANK YOU.

335
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
ONE OF THE BUSIEST PLACES IN

336
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, TODAY MAY

337
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
HAVE BEEN THE GRIEF COUNSELING

338
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
CENTER, BOTH VICTIMS AND THOSE

339
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
AFFECTED BY WHAT HAPPENED FRIDAY

340
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
GOT THE CHANCE TO SPEAK TO

341
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
SOMEONE IF THEY WANTED ABOUT

342
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
WHAT THEY WERE FEELING.

343
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
FOR SOME, THE HEALING COMES IN

344
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
HONORING THOSE VICTIMS.

345
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
ALL DAY LONG, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

346
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
CREATING GIANT MEMORIALS TO

347
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
THOSE WHO WERE KILLED.

348
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'M JOINED NOW BY DR. SANJAY

349
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
GUPTA WHO WAS AT THAT COUNSELING

350
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
CENTER EARLIER.

351
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
WE'RE LOOKING AT A PICTURE THERE

352
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
OF ONE OF THE MAKESHIFT

353
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
MEMORIALS THAT'S SPRUNG UP, SO

354
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
OFTEN SPRUNG UP IN TRAGEDIES
LIKE THIS.

355
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
PEOPLE SPONTANEOUSLY EXPRESSING

356
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
THEIR SORROW, EXPRESSING THEIR

357
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
GRIEF AND THEIR REMEMBRANCES IN

358
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
WAYS LARGE AND SMALL.

359
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
YOU'VE ACTUALLY BEEN LOOKING AT

360
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
STUDIES ABOUT HOW KIDS IN THIS

361
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
AGE RANGE, YOUNG KIDS, DEAL WITH

362
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
WITNESSING A TRAUMATIC EVENT.

363
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, PTSD IS

364
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
SOMETHING WE TYPICALLY THINK OF

365
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
WITH ADULTS.
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THEM WITH

366
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
CHILDREN VERY MUCH AND CERTAINLY

367
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
CHILDREN THIS YOUNG.

368
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
IT EXISTS VERY MUCH SO THE WAY

369
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
THAT THEY -- THEY'RE BEHAVIOR IS

370
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
DIFFERENT.

371
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
THEY DON'T HAVE THE FLASHBACKS,

372
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
THE SORT OF HYPERVIGILANCE THAT

373
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
WE ASSOCIATE WITH PTSD.

374
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
OFTENTIMES YOU SEE IT IN THE WAY

375
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
THEY PLAY, SOMETIMES YOU SEE IT

376
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
IN THE WAY THAT THEY REGRESS.

377
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
THEY MAY START ACTING YOUNGER.

378
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
THEY MAY BE MORE CLINGY.

379
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
THEY MAY HAVE TEMPER TANTRUMS OR

380
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
BEHAVIOR THAT SEEMS OUT OF

381
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
SORTS.

382
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
OFTENTIMES, CAREGIVERS DON'T

383
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.

384
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
>> DOES IT SORT OF -- THE

385
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
TIMETABLE, DOES IT PLAY OUT

386
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
IMMEDIATELY OR IS IT SOMETHING
THAT SHOWS OUTPATIENT MONTHS

387
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
LATER?
>> NO, IT OFTEN SHOWS UP VERY

388
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
EARLY.

389
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT

390
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
BECAUSE IF YOU NOTICE IT EARLY,

391
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
THAT'S PRETTY NORMAL FOR BOTH

392
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
ADULTS AND CHILDREN ALIKE.

393
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
IF IT TURNS INTO NIGHTMARES,

394
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
ANXIETY OR LOSS OF SLEEP, THAT'S

395
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
WHEN USUALLY IT'S TIME TO TRY

396
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
AND MAYBE GET SOME HELP.

397
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE

398
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
BIT LAST NIGHT, ANDERSON.

399
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STUDY

400
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
SPECIFICALLY ON SLEEP, IT'S

401
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
COMPELLING STUFF.

402
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
IF SOMEBODY GETS GOOD SLEEP,

403
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
GOOD QUALITY SLEEP, YOU CAN

404
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
PREDICT MUCH MORE ACCURATELY HOW

405
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
WELL THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

406
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
COPE IN THE LONG RUN.

407
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
AND THAT SLEEP IN THE FIRST FEW

408
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
NIGHTS, LAST NIGHT, TONIGHT,

409
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
PARENTS WATCHING THEIR CHILD'S

410
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
SLEEP PATTERNS TONIGHT IS REALLY

411
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
IMPORTANT.
>> DEFINITELY FASCINATING.

412
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT A

413
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, I THINK IT

414
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
BEARS REPEATING BECAUSE I THINK

415
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
IT HAS CONCERNED A LOT OF

416
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
PARENTS, PARENTS WHOSE KIDS ARE

417
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
ON THE SPECTRUM OF AUTISM OR

418
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
HAVE ASPERGER'S.

419
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
YESTERDAY THERE HAD BEEN A QUOTE

420
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
FROM THE BROTHER OF THE SHOOTER

421
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
WHO THOUGHT HIS BROTHER HAD A

422
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
FORM OF ASPERGER'S AND ALSO A
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

423
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
AUTISM IS NOT A PERSONALITY

424
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
DISORDER.

425
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
LET'S CLARIFY --

426
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
>> YES, AS YOU ALWAYS SAY, TERMS

427
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
DO MATTER HERE.

428
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AUTISM OR

429
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
ANYTHING ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM

430
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
AS THEY CALL IT, IT'S A

431
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER.

432
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN

433
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
THE BRAIN SINCE TIME OF BIRTH.

434
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
THAT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

435
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
THAN A PERSONALITY DISORDER OR

436
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
EVEN A MENTAL ILLNESS WHICH

437
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
COULD COME ON LATER IN LIFE.

438
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
BUT THE MORE CRUCIAL POINT IS

439
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
IT'S NOT ASSOCIATED WITH SORT OF

440
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
PLANNED VIOLENCE.

441
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
IT JUST ISN'T.

442
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
>> I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A YOUNG

443
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
PERSON WITH AUTISM COMMITTING A

444
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
PREPLANNED ACT OF VIOLENCE.

445
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
>> I HADN'T EITHER.

446
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
BUT I WENT AND LOOKED AT THE

447
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
STUDIES AGAIN.
THE STUDY THAT EVERYONE QUOTESES

448
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
IS A STUDY OF ABOUT 132 PEOPLE,

449
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
THAT'S NOT A HUGE STUDY BUT IT'S

450
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
ONE OF THE BIGGEST STUDIES OUT
THERE.

451
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
OF THOSE 132, THERE WERE ONLY

452
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
THREE SORT OF EPISODES OF

453
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
VIOLENCE.

454
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
AS YOU MENTIONED, NONE OF THEM
PREPLANNED.

455
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
THERE'S NO LINK.

456
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I THINK I CAN SAFELY SAY THERE'S

457
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
NO LINK BETWEEN AUTISM SPECTRUM

458
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
AND PREPLANNED VIOLENCE.

459
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
WE CAN DISPEL THAT --

460
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
>> THERE ARE SO MANY KIDS WHO

461
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
ARE NOW DIAGNOSED SOMEWHERE ON

462
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
THE AUTISM SPECK TRIM.

463
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF

464
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
PARENTS, OUTRAGED THAT PEOPLE

465
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
ARE USING THE TERM AUTISM AND

466
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
LINKING IT SOMEHOW TO THE

467
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
SHOOTING.

468
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
YOU JUST CLARIFIED --
>> I HOPE THEY'RE WATCHING.

469
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I THINK IT'S AN EDUCATIONAL

470
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
POINT.

471
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

472
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE KIND

473
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
OF -- WHAT SHOULD PARENTS BE

474
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
WATCHING FOR, DO YOU THINK, IN

475
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS?

476
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
>> I THINK THERE IS A -- THERE'S

477
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
A LOT OF NORMAL SORT OF GRIEF

478
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
THAT'S GOING ON.

479
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I THINK OBVIOUSLY WITH CHILDREN,

480
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SORT OF THE

481
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
THING -- IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

482
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
THE THINGS YOU MIGHT EXPECT.

483
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
ADULTS HAVE A MUCH BETTER WAY OF

484
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
VERBALIZING THESE THINGS.

485
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

486
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
PARENTS TO NOW AND A LOT OF

487
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
EXPERTS HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS.

488
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
BUT THIS IS NORMAL IN THE FIRST

489
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
FEW DAYS.

490
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF IT

491
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
PROGRESSES LONGER TERM, THEN

492
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
PEOPLE DO NEED TO GET HELP.

493
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
THERE IS HELP AVAILABLE HERE P

494
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
PHONE LINES BUT ALSO A GRIEF
CENTER AVAILABLE.

495
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
IF IT'S PERSISTENT, THAT HELP

496
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
NEEDS -- THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

497
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
THINKING OF MENTAL ILLNESS OR

498
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
THESE TYPES OF PROBLEMS WITH

499
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
PHYSICAL ILLNESS AS IT IS.

500
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
WE TEND TO PUT THESE THINGS IN

501
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
DIFFERENT BUCKETS.

502
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
THE IDEA THAT YOU THINK ABOUT

503
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
MENTAL ILLNESS AS YOU DO IN

504
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
CARDIAC DISEASE -- IT'S

505
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
STIGMATIZED.

506
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES.

507
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
WE TALK ABOUT IT IN SITUATIONS

508
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
LIKE THIS.

509
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
BUT HOPEFULLY IT WILL CATCH ON.

510
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
>> FOR PARENTS WHO HAVE A CHILD

511
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
WITH SOME SORT OF MENTAL

512
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
DISORDER -- AND THERE'S A LOT WE

513
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS SHOOTER.

514
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
BUT IN PAST CASES, IN THE

515
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
VIRGINIA TECH INSTANCE, PARENTS

516
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
TRIED TO GET HELP FOR THE CHILD

517
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
OR FOR THE YOUNG ADULT.

518
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
AND UNLESS THAT PERSON CAN BE

519
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
PROVED TO BE VIOLENT OR IS A

520
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
THREAT TO THEMSELVES OR SOMEBODY

521
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
ELSE, THEY OFTEN CAN'T GET HELP.

522
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

523
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
PARENTS CAN ANGUISH OVER THIS.

524
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
OFTENTIMES, THEY KNEW THE SIGNS

525
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
BUT COULDN'T GET HELP.

526
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
YOU MENTIONED VIRGINIA TECH,

527
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
THREE MONTHS LATER,

528
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
THREE-QUARTERS OF THE STUDENTS

529
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
STILL HAD SOME FORM OF PTSD.

530
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
THIS CAN LAST QUITE A LONG TIME.

531
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
>> THANK YOU, SANJAY.

532
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
A LOT MORE AHEAD.

533
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
WE'LL TAKE A SHORT BREAK.

534
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
YOUR COVERAGE CONTINUES FROM
HERE IN NEWTOWN.

535
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Music is a universal language.

536
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But when I was in an accident...

537
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I was worried the
health care system

538
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
spoke a language all its own

539
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
With UnitedHealthcare,
I got help that fit my life.

540
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Information on my phone.

541
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Connection to doctors who
get where I'm from.

542
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And tools to estimate what
my care may cost.

543
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So I never missed a beat.

544
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
We're more than 78,000
people looking out for

545
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
more than 70
million Americans.

546
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's health in numbers.
UnitedHealthcare.

547
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
TO PRACTICE MATH
MORE?

548
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I LOVE MATH!

549
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
BUT TWO iPADS
MEANS TWO DATA PLANS?

550
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
THAT'S CRAZY.

551
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
MAYBE NOT.

552
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
WITH AT&T MOBILE SHARE,

920
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
WAS AND HOW MANY LIVES THAT SHE

921
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
WAS ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT

922
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
TIME HERE ON EARTH.

923
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND

924
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
VERY LOVING.

925
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
EMILIE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO TRY

926
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
NEW THINGS, OTHER THAN FOOD.

927
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
SHE LOVED TO USE HER TALENTS TO

928
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
TOUCH THE LIVES OF EVERYONE THAT

929
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
SHE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH.

930
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
SHE WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL ARTIST

931
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
AND SHE ALWAYS CARRIED AROUND

932
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
HER MARKERS AND PENCILS SO SHE

933
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
NEVER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO

934
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
DRAW A PICTURE OR MAKE A CARD

935
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
FOR THOSE AROUND HER.

936
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF

937
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
TIMES EMILIE NOTICED SOMEONE

938
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
FEELING SAD OR FRUSTRATED AND

939
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
WOULD RUSH TO FIND A PIECE OF

940
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
PAPER TO DRAW THEM A PICTURE OR

941
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
TO WRITE THEM AN ENCOURAGING

942
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
NOTE.

943
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
EMILIE'S CARD MAKING WAS

944
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
EXPRESSED BEAUTIFULLY THIS LAST

945
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
OCTOBER WHEN SHE PLACED A VERY

946
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
SPECIAL CARD SHE HAD MADE INTO

947
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
THE CASKET WITH HER GRANDPA, WHO

948
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
ALSO JUST RECENTLY DIED OF A

949
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
TRAGIC ACCIDENT.

950
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER TWO

951
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
LITTLE SISTERS AND DELIGHTED IN

952
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ, DANCE

953
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS IN

954
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
LIFE.

955
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
EMILIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS

956
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE

957
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
PLEASURE TO MEET HER WOULD AGREE

958
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
THAT THIS WORLD IS A BETTER

959
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
PLACE BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN IN IT.

960
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
SHE WAS THEIR BEST FRIEND.

961
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
THEY WERE ALL BORN WITHIN THREE

962
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
YEARS OF EACH OTHER SO BY LAW,

963
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE.

964
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
SHE WAS TEACHING MY MIDDLE

965
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
DAUGHTER TO READ.

966
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
SHE WOULD HELP MY YOUNGEST

967
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
DAUGHTER LEARN HOW TO MAKE

968
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
THINGS, SHOW HER HOW TO DO

969
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
CRAFTS.
THEY LOOKED UP TO HER AND THEY

970
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
LOOKED TO HER WHEN THEY NEEDED

971
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
COMFORT.
USUALLY THAT'S SAVED FOR A MOM

972
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
AND A DAD.

973
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
BUT IT WAS REALLY SWEET TO SEE

974
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
THE TIMES WHEN ONE OF THEM WOULD
FALL OR GET THEIR FEELINGS HURT,

975
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
HOW THEY WOULD RUN TO EMILIE TO

976
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
GET SUPPORT AND HUGS AND KISSES.

977
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT

978
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
COULD JUST LIGHT UP A ROOM.

979
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING KIND TO

980
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
SAY ABOUT ANYBODY.

981
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
AND HER LOVE AND THE STRENGTH

982
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
THAT SHE GAVE US AND THE EXAMPLE

983
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
THAT SHE SHOWED TO US IS

984
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
REMARKABLE.

985
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON.

986
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
AND I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER

987
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
DAD.

988
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I WAS LEAVING TO WORK AND SHE

989
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT.

990
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
AND I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TEACHING

991
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
HER PORTUGUESE.

992
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
SO OUR LAST CONVERSATION WAS IN

993
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
PORTUGUESE.

994
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
AND SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING.

995
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

996
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I SAID THAT I WAS DOING WELL.

997
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME.

998
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT

999
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THE DOOR.

1000
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
FREE AGENCY IS GIVEN TO ALL OF

1001
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
US TO ACT AND DO WHAT WE WANT.

1002
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM
US.

1003
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

1004
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
THAT HE WAS GIVEN AND THAT'S
WHAT HE CHOSE TO DO WITH IT.

1005
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I KNOW THAT GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT

1006
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
AWAY.

1007
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I'M NOT MAD BECAUSE I HAVE MY

1008
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
AGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT I USE

1009
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
THIS EVENT TO DO WHAT I CAN TO

1010
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
DO WHATEVER I CAN.

1011
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY

1012
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
FAMILY AND MY WIFE AND MY

1013
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
DAUGHTERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF AND

1014
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
THAT IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I

1015
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
CAN DO TO HELP ANYBODY AT ANY

1016
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
TIME, ANYWHERE, I'D BE WILLING
TO DO THAT.

1017
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT HAPPENED

1018
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO SO MANY

1019
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN INTO

1020
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US, BUT

1021
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US TO BE

1022
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
BETTER, TO BE MORE COMPASSIONATE

1023
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
AND MORE HUMBLE PEOPLE.

1024
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
>> A FATHER IN MOURNING SPEAKING

1025
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
OF COMPASSION FOR OTHERS.

1026
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT SCHOOL IS

1027
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
SADLY JUST THE LATEST ON A LONG

1028
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
LIST OF VIOLENT ATTACKS WITH

1029
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
GUNS OVER THE YEARS.

1030
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
WHEN WE FIRST HEARD WHAT

1031
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
HAPPENED IN CONNECTICUT, PEOPLE

1032
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
PROBABLY THOUGHT ABOUT THE OTHER

1033
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
DEADLY SHOOTINGS.

1034
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
JOINING ME NOW IS PASTOR ROCKY

1035
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000

LITTLETON, COLORADO, WHEN THE

1037
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
COLUMBINE SITUATION OCCURRED.

1038
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY FOR FAMILIES WHO

1039
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
COME TO YOU AND PEOPLE IN THIS

1040
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
COMMUNITY WHO WEREN'T EVEN

1046
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
BUT AS A CHRISTIAN, YOU TELL

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
THEM, THERE'S HOPE IN THE LORD.

1048
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
GOD KNOWS WHERE YOU'RE AT.

1049
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
GOD CARES FOR YOU AND LOVES YOU.

1050
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
RATHER THAN SAYING A LOT ABOUT

1051
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
JESUS, TRYING TO BE LIKE JESUS.

1052
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
>> IT SEEMS, TOO, A LOT OF TIMES

1053
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
JUST BEING THERE IS IMPORTANT

1054
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
AND LISTENING IS AS IMPORTANT AS

1055
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
WHAT YOU SAY.

1056
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
>> YEAH, VERY MUCH SO.

1057
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
THAT'S WHAT ANYBODY NEEDS IN

1058
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
THIS KIND OF SETTING.

1059
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
AND HAVING BEEN IN THIS SETTING

1060
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
A TIME BEFORE, AND ACTUALLY I'M

1061
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000

>> YEAH, RIGHT PLACE AT THE

AND THE CHURCH THAT I PASTOR, I

1068
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
THINK THEY FEEL THAT WAY, TOO.

1069
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
WE'VE BEEN CONDUCTING PRAYER

1070
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
MEETINGS IN THE AREA, PRAYING

1071
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000

>> IT IS EXTRAORDINARY -- I'VE

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
SPENT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME IN

1078
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
THIS TOWN.

1079
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
JUST TO SEE HOW PEOPLE ARE

1080
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
COMING TOGETHER.

1081
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
PEOPLE ARE STOPPING HERE, PEOPLE

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
PAIN WHEN WE GO THROUGH A CRISIS

1091
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
SITUATION.

1092
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
WE NEED EACH OTHER AND THAT'S

1093
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS

1094
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
ABOUT COMMUNITY.

1095

>> DO YOU ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO

1096
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
TALK ABOUT IT?

1097
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I LOST A BROTHER YEARS AGO TO

1098
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
SUICIDE.
AND MY MOM FOUND IT HELPFUL TO

1099
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
TALK ABOUT IT OVER AND OVER

1100
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
AGAIN.
AND I FOUND IT VERY, VERY

1101
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
DIFFICULT AND EVEN STILL TO THIS
DAY.

1102
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000

TALK TO GOD, TALK TO HIM

AND HE UNDERSTANDS IN A WAY THAT

1109
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
A PERSON REALLY CAN'T.

1110
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000

CREATION.
GOD'S THE CREATOR AND THERE IS

1124
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
AN ADVERSARY, THERE IS AN ENEMY.

1125
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
GOD'S NOT THE AUTHOR OF THIS.

1126
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
THE BIBLE SAYS THAT GOD IS THE

1127
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
AUTHOR OF ABUNDANT LIFE.

1128
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
THE DEVIL IS THE AUTHOR OF THIS

1129
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
KIND OF LIFE.

1130

BUT GOD IS BIGGER THAN THAT.

00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000

IN THE DAYS, THE WEEKS AND

1300
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000

BREAK AND BE BACK IN A MOMENT.

1304

1313
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
>>> THE SHOOTING IN NEWTOWN IS

1314
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
NOW IF SECOND DEADLIEST SCHOOL

1315
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
SHOOTING IN U.S. HISTORY BEHIND

1316
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
THE VIRGINIA TECH MASSACRE IN

1317
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
2007.
AFTER EVERY EVENT LIKE THIS, THE

1318
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
QUESTIONS ALWAYS ARE THE SAME,

1319
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
WHAT CAUSES THIS KIND OF A

1320
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
SHOOTING?

1321
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN?

1322
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
HOW CAN THEY BE STOPPED?

1323
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I'M JOINED NOW BY KATHERINE

1324
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
NEWMAN FROM BALTIMORE WHO WROTE

1325
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
THE BOOK "RAMPAGE, THE SOCIAL

1326
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
ROOTS OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS" SHE'S

1327
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
STUDIED MANY OF THESE KINDS OF
EVENTS.

1328
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I'VE READ A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
YOUR RESEARCH.

1329
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT

1330
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
THESE SHOOTINGS THAT ARE SORT OF

1331
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
COUNTERINTUITIVE?

1332
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
PEOPLE THINK THEY KNOW WHAT

1333
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
CAUSES THEM AT TIMES ABOUT THE

1334
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
COLUMBINE.

1335
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
BUT SO MANY OF THE THINGS WE

1336
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
THOUGHT WE KNEW ABOUT COLUMBINE

1337
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
HAVE TURNED OUT NOT TO BE TRUE.

1338
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
WHAT DO WE NOW KNOW ABOUT WHAT

1339
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
CAUSES THESE KINDS OF EVENTS?

1340
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
>> THAT'S SO TRUE.

1341
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
SOME OF THE COMMON MYTHS ARE

1342
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
THAT THESE THINGS ARE

1343
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
SPONTANEOUS.

1344
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
THEY'RE ALMOST NEVER

1345
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
SPONTANEOUS.

1346
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
SOME OF THE SHOOTINGS WE STUDIED

1347
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
WERE PLANNED OVER A NINE-MONTH
PERIOD.

1348
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
SADLY IN MANY INSTANCES, THERE

1349
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
ARE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE

1350
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
AN INKLING.

1351
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
IN SOME OF THE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS

1352
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
WE STUDIED, THERE WERE CHILDREN

1353
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
WHO DIDN'T COME TO SCHOOL THAT

1354
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
DAY BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED
SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN

1355
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
BUT SADLY THEY NEVER TOLD ANYONE

1356
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
WHO COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING.

1357
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
AND SO ONE OF THE

1358
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
COUNTERINTUITIVE THINGS WE

1359
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
LEARNED WAS THAT THERE'S A LOT

1360
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
OF INFORMATION OFTEN CIRCULATING

1361
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
BUT IT DOESN'T GET TO THE RIGHT

1362
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
PLACE.
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WAS TRUE IN

1363
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE.

1364
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
IT WILL TAKE TIME BEFORE WE KNOW

1365
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
ENOUGH TO GENERALIZE TO IT.

1366
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
BUT IN THE STUDIES WE STUDIED --

1367
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
AND WE STUDIED ALL OF THEM FROM

1368
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
THE 1970s ONWARD IN THE UNITED

1369
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
STATES, IT WAS FREQUENTLY THE

1370
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
CASE THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF

1371
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
KNOWLEDGE IN PEER COMMUNITIES

1372
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
THAT DIDN'T GET THROUGH TO THE
ADULTS IN TIME TO DO ANYTHING

1373
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
ABOUT IT.

1374
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT IT

1375
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
FREQUENTLY HAPPENS IN TOWNS JUST

1376
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
LIKE NEWTOWN, SMALL, RURAL

1377
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
SETTINGS, NOT THE PLACES THAT WE

1378
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
THINK OF AS CHARACTERISTICALLY

1379
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
VIOLENT.

1380
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
WE THINK OF BIG CITIES AS PLACES

1381
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
WHERE THERE'S GUN VIOLENCE.

1382
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
AND OF COURSE THERE IS.
BUT THESE KINDS OF SHOOTINGS

1383
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
DON'T HAPPEN IN BIG CITIES.

1384
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
THEY HAPPEN USUALLY IN SMALL

1385
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
TOWNS OR SUBURBS.

1386
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
>> AND IS THERE A COMMON THREAD

1387
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
IN THE MENTAL HEALTH HISTORY OF

1388
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
THE BOYS INVOLVED IN THESE?

1389
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
>> THERE IS ALMOST ALWAYS A

1390
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION.

1391
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
THE SAD THING IS IT'S OFTEN

1392
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
UNRECOGNIZED AND UNTREATED.

1393
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
SO WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL BE

1394
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
TRUE IN THIS CASE.

1395
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
BUT IN MOST OF THE CASES WE

1396
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
LOOKED AT, THERE WAS

1397
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
AFTER-THE-FACT EVIDENCE OF

1398
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
MENTAL DISORDERS BUT NO

1399
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
TREATMENT.

1400
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
THAT'S DISTURBING BECAUSE WE

1401
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
LIKE TO THINK WE CAN RECOGNIZE

1402
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
THE SYMPTOMS.

1403
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
BUT PARTICULARLY WHEN THE

1404
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
SHOOTERS ARE YOUNGER THAN THIS
ONE, THE ONES WE LOOKED AT WERE

1405
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
13, 12, THE SIGNS OF

1406
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
DISTINGUISHED MENTAL ILLNESS

1407
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
THAT ARE GOING TO BE SO VIVID IF

1408
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
THEY SURVIVE INTO THEIR 20s ARE

1409
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
NOT SO EASY TO DISCERN WHEN

1410
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
THEY'RE 13.

1411
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
SO SADLY THERE IS A -- THERE'S

1412
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
EVIDENCE AFTER THE FACT OFTEN

1413
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
THAT COMES UP IN FORENSIC

1414
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
EXAMINATIONS, BUT NOT THE KIND F

1415
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
OF EVIDENCE THAT LEADS TO THE

1416
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
TREATMENT THAT THEY SO

1417
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
DESPERATELY NEED.

1418
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
>> IT'S ALSO INTERESTING IN THE

1419
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
BOOK TITLE, YOU TALK ABOUT THE

1420
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
SOCIAL ROOTS OF THESE SHOOTINGS.

1421
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
OFTENTIMES THE IDEAS THAT THESE

1422
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
ARE LONERS ON THE FRINGE.

1423
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
BUT YOU'VE FOUND IT'S NOT THAT

1424
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
SIMPLE.

1425
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
>> NO.

1426
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
SADLY THEY ARE RARELY LONERS.

1427
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
IT'S MORE CHARACTERISTIC TO SAY

1428
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
THEY'RE FAILED JOINERS.

1429
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

1430
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
TYPICALLY TRIED TO JOIN GROUPS

1431
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
AND ARE REBUFFED AND REJECTED.

1432
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
SO THEIR EXPERIENCE IS NOT THAT

1433
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
OF BEING A LONER.

1434
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
IT'S OF BEING PUSHED ASIDE AND

1435
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
MADE TO FEEL REJECTED.

1436
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
AND SO WHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS

1437
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
WITH THESE YOUNG MEN IS THAT

1438
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
THEY GO THROUGH A WHOLE SERIES

1439
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
OF EFFORTS TO TRY AND GET

1440
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
ATTENTION AND INGRATIATE

1441
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
THEMSELVES IN GROUPS.

1442
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
ALL THOSE EFFORTS FAIL AND THEY

1443
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
START TALKING ABOUT SHOOTING

1444
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
PEOPLE AND SUDDENLY EVERYONE'S

1445
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
PAYING ATTENTION.

1446
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
SO THEY'RE TRYING TO CHANGE HOW

1447
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THEM AND

1448
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
NOTORIOUS AND EVIL SEEMS BETTER

1449
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
TO THEM THAN A LOSER.

1450
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
>> IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I

1451
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
BELIEVE JUST IN NOT TRYING TO

1452
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
MENTION THEIR NAMES BECAUSE JUST

1453
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY CAN

1454
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN GAME FAME

1455
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
OR NOTORIETY BY DOING THIS, I

1456
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
JUST DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD TO

1457
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
PERPETUATE THAT.

1458
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I KIND YOUR RESEARCH REALLY

1459
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
FASCINATING.

1460
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'D LOOV TO TALK TO YOU MORE IN

1461
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
THE DAYS AHEAD.

1462
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.
>> MY PLEASURE, ANDERSON.

1463
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
>> SOME MEMORIES ARE SEARED INTO

1464
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
OUR MINDS NO MATTER HOW MUCH ONE

1465
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
WANTS TO FORGET THEM.

1466
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
THE NEWTOWN SHOOTING NO DOUBT

1467
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY FOR ONE

1468
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
OF THE SCHOOL'S TEACHERS.

1469
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
YET IN THE MIDST OF A CRISIS,

1470
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
SHE STAYED REMARKABLY CALM FOR

1471
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
HER KINDERGARTEN STUDENTS.

1472
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I TALKED TO HER, JANET VOLLMER

1473
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
IS HER NAME.

1474
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I WANT YOU TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAID

1475
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
ABOUT HOW SHE GOT HERSELF

1476
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
THROUGH THIS CRISIS.

1477
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
LISTEN.
>> ABOUT 9:30, 9:40, WE HEARD

1478
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
NOISES.
AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM WAS

1479
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
STILL ON.

1480
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
SO IT DIDN'T GO OFF.

1481
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
SO YOU COULD HEAR WHAT SOUNDED

1482
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
LIKE POPS, GUNSHOTS.

1483
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
OF COURSE I'M NOT GOING TO TELL

1484
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
THAT TO 5-YEAR-OLDS.

1485
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
SO I SAID TO THEM, WE'RE GOING

1486
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
OVER IN A SAFE AREA AND WE'RE

1487
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
GOING TO -- WE READ A STORY AND

1488
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
WE KEPT THEM CALM.

1489
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
DID A LOCKDOWN DRILL, CLOSED THE

1490
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
DOORS, LOCKED -- COVERED THE

1491
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
WINDOWS.

1492
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
KEPT THE CHILDREN WITH US.

1493
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I HAVE OTHER ADULTS --

1494
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
>> I FIND THAT AMAZING THAT

1495
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
FEARING THAT YOU HEAR GUNSHOTS,

1496
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
YOU WERE ABLE TO HAVE THE

1497
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
COMPOSURE TO SIT DOWN AND READ

1498
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
TO YOUR STUDENTS.
THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.

1499
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

1500
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
WITH 5-YEAR-OLDS BECAUSE YOU
CAN'T LOSE IT.

1501
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG
TIME.

1502
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
IT'S MY 18th YEAR OF TEACHING.

1503
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
MY JOB WAS TO KEEP THEM SAFE.

1504
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I DIDN'T KNOW -- THERE WAS NO

1505
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
ANNOUNCEMENT OF WHAT WAS GOING

1506
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
ON.
MY INSTINCT WAS IT WASN'T GOOD.

1507
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
SO WE KEPT THEM CALM.

1508
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
WE STAYED IN THE ROOM UNTIL

1509
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
THERE WAS BANGING AT THE DOOR,

1510
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
WHICH WERE THE POLICE AND THE

1511
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
TROOPERS OR WHOEVER WAS THERE.

1512
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
THEY HAD US EXIT THE BUILDING.

1513
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
THEY TOLD THE CHILDREN TO COVER

1514
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
THEIR EYES AND WALK IN A LINE

1515
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
AND LEAVE THE BUILDING AND

1516
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
THAT'S WHEN WE WENT DOWN TOWARDS

1517
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
THE FIREHOUSE.

1518
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
WE WERE ALL SAFE.

1519
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I HAD 19 CHILDREN IN THE ROOM

1520
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
WITH ME AND THANK GOODNESS ALL

1521
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
OF THEIR PARENTS WERE ABLE TO

1522
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
COME AND PICK THEM UP AND TAKE

1523
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
THEM HOME.

1524
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
>> AS YOU WERE READING TO THEM,

1525
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
DID THE KIDS REALIZE SOMETHING

1526
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
WAS GOING ON OR DID THEY JUST

1527
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
THINK IT WAS A DRILL LIKE YOU'D

1528
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
HAD BEFORE?

1529
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
>> RIGHT.

1530
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
IT DIDN'T SEEM A NATURAL THING.

1531
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
ALTHOUGH WE DO PRACTICE DRILLS.

1532
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
WE JUST SAID, WELL, WE'RE NOT

1533
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
REALLY SURE BUT WE'RE GOING TO

1534
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
BE SAFE BECAUSE WE'RE SITTING

1535
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
OVER HERE AND WE'RE ALL

1536
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
TOGETHER.
AND THAT'S AS WE GOT DOWN TO THE

1537
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
FIREHOUSE LATER ON, AS A LOT OF

1538
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
THE EVENTS STARTED TO UNFOLD

1539
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY, I THINK SOME

1540
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
OF THEM REALIZED THE MAGNITUDE

1541
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.

1542
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
THEY SAW OTHER PEOPLE UPSET.

1543
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
BUT WE JUST HELD THEM CLOSE

1544
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
UNTIL THEIR PARENTS CAME AND WE

1545
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
RELEASED THEM.

1546
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
MY ROOM, MY CHILDREN WERE ALL

1547
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
ACCOUNTED FOR AND SAFE IN MY

1548
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
KI
KIRPD GARTIN CLASSROOM.

1549
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
>> WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE

1550
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
KIDS DEALING WITH THE POTENTIAL

1551
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
FOR PTSD.

1552
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
ALSO FIRST RESPONDERS DEALING

1553
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
WITH THE STRESS IN ALL OF THIS

1554
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
AND WHAT THEY'VE HAD TO SEE.

1555
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
TERRY LYLES DEALS WITH STRESS

1556
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT.

1557
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
HE JOINS ME FROM MIAMI.

1558
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
IT IS EASY TO FORGET THESE

1559
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
SCENES ARE PROBABLY THE WORST

1560
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
MANY OF THESE EMERGENCY WORKERS

1561
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
HAVE EVER WITNESSED.

1562
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE THINGS THEY

1563
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
SAW IN THOSE SCHOOLS -- IN THAT
SCHOOL.

1564
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
YOU HELP RESCUE WORKERS DEAL

1565
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
WITH TRAGEDY FOLLOWING THE

1566
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
SEPTEMBER 11th ATTACKS.

1567
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE?

1568
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
HOW DO YOU HELP THEM?

1569
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
>> WELL, ANDERSON, THANK YOU FOR

1570
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
HAVING ME.

1571
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I THINK THE BIGGEST THING THAT

1572
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE

1573
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
CLOSEST YOU ARE TO THE

1574
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
EPICENTER, HEARING THE SHOTS,

1575
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
SEEING THE VIOLENCE VISUALLY,

1576
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
THE MORE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO

1577
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
BE ABLE TO DEBRIEF.

1578
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
AS I DEBRIEF SPECIAL FORCES

1579
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
PEOPLE AND SOLDIERS, IT'S VERY

1580
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
IMPORTANT THAT THESE CHILDREN,

1581
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
THEIR PARENTS UNDERSTAND THAT

1582
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
THERE'S LIFE AFTER TRAGEDY BUT

1583
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEIR

1584
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
STORIES, WE HAVE TO HELP THEM

1585
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
VENT AND RELEASE THAT

1586
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN

1587
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
NORMALIZE AND GO BACK TO SOME

1588
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
TYPE OF LIFE AS THEY KNEW IT

1589
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
BEFORE THIS TRAGIC DAY.

1590
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
>> WHAT KIND OF SYMPTOMS DO

1591
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
PARENTS, DO FRIENDS OF PEOPLE

1592
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR?

1593
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
>> WELL, TYPICALLY WITH

1594
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
CHILDREN, IT'S ALL AGE

1595
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
APPROPRIATENESS.

1596
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
SO IT REALLY DEPENDS.

1597
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
BUT USUALLY SLEEP CAN BE

1598
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
DISRUPTED.

1599
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
THERE CAN BE NIGHTMARES.

1600
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
THERE COULD BE SUDDEN NOISES

1601
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
THAT COULD STARTLE THEM.

1602
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
MOODINESS THAT YOU'VE NOT SEEN

1603
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
BEFORE, MAYBE A LOSS IN APPETITE

1604
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
OR A LOSS OF INTEREST IN NORMAL

1605
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
THINGS.

1606
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
AND I THINK FOR PARENTS MAINLY,

1607
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
WE'RE ALL JUST MORTIFIED BY THIS

1608
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
EVENT.

1609
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
AND I THINK AS PARENTS WE HAVE

1610
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TALKING

1611
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
TO OUR CHILDREN, REGARDLESS OF

1612
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
WHERE WE ARE IN THE COUNTRY OR

1613
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
AROUND THE WORLD, THAT WE CAN

1614
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
LET OUR CHILDREN KNOW AND

1615
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
SUPPORT THEM TO SAY, LISTEN,

1616
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
IT'S OKAY, THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN

1617
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

1618
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
THIS WAS NOT A NORMAL SITUATION

1619
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
AND WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THEM AND

1620
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
CARE FOR THEM THAT THEY KNOW

1621
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
THAT THEY'RE SECURED IN A NORMAL

1622
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN.

1623
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
>> BUT TALKING ABOUT IT HELPS?

1624
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
>> WELL, AGAIN, IT DEPENDS ON

1625
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
THE AGE.
THE AGES OF THE KIDS THAT YOU

1626
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
MENTIONED, I AGREE WITH YOU.

1627
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

1628
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
BE ABLE TO EVEN NAME THE NAMES

1629
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
AND THE AGES OF THESE CHILDREN.

1630
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
IT'S HEARTBREAKING.

1631
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
AND I THINK WHAT HE CAN DO, AS

1632
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
WE TALK TO OUR CHILDREN, IF

1633
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
CHILDREN CAN DRAW PICTURES AND

1634
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
WRITE LETTERS IF THAT'S WHAT IT

1635
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
GOES, TO FRIENDS THAT THEY LOST

1636
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
OR THE SITUATIONS THEY HEARD AND

1637
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
DESTROY THOSE LETTERS.

1638
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
WE DESTROY EVERYTHING THAT IS OF

1639
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
WASTE TO US.

1640
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
WE PUT GARBAGE BAGS OUT.

1641
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
WE FLUSH GARBAGE DISPOSALS.

1642
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH THE

1643
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
EMOTIONAL WASTE.
WE HAVE TO HELP THEM VENT AND

1644
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
PROCESS, RELEASE IT AND LET THEM

1645
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
KNOW AS WE TALK TO THEM THAT

1646
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
THEY HAVE A REFUGE WITHIN US AND

1647
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
THAT WE AS PARENTS ARE THERE TO

1648
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
SUPPORT THEM THROUGH THIS
SITUATION.

1649
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
>> TERRY LYLES, I APPRECIATE

1650
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
YOUR EXPERTISE.
NO DOUBT, WE'LL BE TALKING TO

1651
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
YOU IN THE DAYS AHEAD AS WELL.

1652
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
