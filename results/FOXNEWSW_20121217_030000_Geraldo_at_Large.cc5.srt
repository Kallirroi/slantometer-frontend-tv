SOME OF THE BROADER THINGS THAT

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
YOU TALKED ABOUT.

667
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
WE HAVE SCHOOL RESEARCH OFFICERS

668
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000

671
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
IT HAS BEEN ELIMINATED.

672
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
IT WAS ELIMINATED AND THE U.S.

673
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000

674
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
THINGS THERE AND FIND OUT WHY

684
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
PEOPLE STOP THAT WHEN THERE

685
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
WASN'T A CRISIS IN THE

686
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
HEADLINES.
>> DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT

687
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
HAS FAILED DO YOU THINK HE HAS

688
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
EARNED WHAT HE GOT FROM THE

689
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
BRADY GROUP THAT WANTS TO BAN

690
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS.

691
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
>> I THINK INSIDE THE BELTWAY

692
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
FAILED AS A WHOLE WITH CONGRESS

693
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000

MY THING IS ONE AGAIN CHIEF SAID

697
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
ONE THING IS NOT TO SECURE IT.

698
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
THEY POLITICIZE IT RIGHT AWAY.

699
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
TAKE THE THINGS WE KNOW WORK WHY

700
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
DO WE CUT THEM AND WHY DO THEY

701
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
ALLOW THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

702
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000

706
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I AM NOT SUGGESTING IT WILL BE

707
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
THE CURE BUT WHAT ARE YOU TAKING

708
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000

712
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000

00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS BY JUST

741
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
RESPONDING.

742
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
TOO MUCH TIME GOES BY.

743
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
>> IN 90 SECONDS THE BAD GUY IS

744
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
IN THERE KILLING KIDS.

745
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
TOUGH STOP IT IN THE FIRST 5

746
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
SECONDS.
>> ABSOLUTELY.

747
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
>> SECONDLY THE POLICE HAVE

748
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
LIMITED RESOURCES.

749
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I AM NOT QUITE SURE THAT TAKING

750
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
FROM THE POLICE WITH THEIR

751
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
SECU

752
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
CURRENT NUMBERS.
I MIGHT SUGGEST EACH COMMUNITY

753
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE.

754
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I WOULD HAVE A READY POOL OF

755
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
TRAINED PEOPLE.

756
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
BUT YOU HAVE GOT ALL OF THESE

757
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
HIGHLY DECORATED VALUED COMBAT

758
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
VETERANS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN

WHO ARE IN NEED OF JOBS.

760
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
WHO BETTER TO PROTECT OUR

761
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
CHILDREN THAN THE PEOPLE WHO

762
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
PROTECTED AND SAVED OUR LIVES ON

763
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
THE FRONT LINE.

764
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
>> WE HAVE 117,000 SCHOOLS IN

765
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
THE COUNTRY.

766
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
WE HAVE TO STOP THE VICIOUS

767
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
CYCLE WHERE THE CRISIS HAPPENS

768
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
WE TALK ABOUT IT FOR A WHILE AND

769
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
THEN WE GO BACK TO NORMAL.

770
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
EVERY DAY IN THIS COUNTRY THEY

771
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
ARE THINKING SAFETY.

772
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
IF THE MOFTMENT IS FOR ARMED

773
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
PEOPLE IN SCHOOLS -- I DON'T

774
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
KNOW IF THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

775
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
>> I JUST WANT ONE, ONE PERSON A

776
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
SUPERINTENDENT, THE HEAD

777
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
JANITOR, IT COULD BE THE FIZZ ED

778
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
TEACHER, IT COULD BE A UNIFORMED

779
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
SECURITY GUY IT COULD BE THE

780
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
HISTORY TEACHER.

781
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
JUST ONE.

782
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
>> SO YOU ARE NOT SITTING DUCKS

783
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
WHEN YOU HAVE A MASSACRE GOING

784
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
ON.
>> NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THAT.

785
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
THAT IS A GOOD DEBATE TO HAVE.

786
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I WOULD HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT

787
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
BETTER TO UNDERSTAND THE

788
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
BACKGROUND ON THESE PEOPLE AND

789
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000

FIREARM.

791
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
MORE IMPORTANT THING TO SAY IS

792
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
WE NEED TO DIALOGUE WE CAN'T

793
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000

815
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
TO REMEMBER THE FACT THAT 17

JOHN BOEHNER AGREED TO HAVE

FROM THE 35-36 PERCENT.

827
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I THINK IT'S 36 PERCENT.

828
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
ONLY THOSE MAKING OVER 1 MILLION

829
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000

POLITICAL NATURE OF IT?

843
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000

844
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T KNOW QUITE

845
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000

WITH PEOPLE WHO CALL IT

849
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
POLITICAL THAT YOU DON'T THINK

850
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
YOU CAN TOLERATE IT ANY MORE.

851
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
THEY ARE SAYING NOWHERE THEY

852
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
ALLOW THINGS TO GO ON.

LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT THINGS
THAT ARE FEEDING INTO IT WHETHER

857
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
IT IS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES,

858
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
WHETHER IT'S THE AVAILABILITY OF

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

860
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
THEY HAVE MASS KILLINGS AND

861
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS

862
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
NOT JUST GUN CONTROL.

863
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000

868
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
>> THERE IS A LOT OF

869
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
SIMILARITIES CHILDREN, WE SAW

870
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
PARENTS STRUGGLING TO FIND

871
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
ANSWERS FOR THIS.

872
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
THEY HAVE SIMILAR ISSUES WITH

873
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
THIS.
OR SHELL SHOCKED AFTER THAT.

874
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH THE

875
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
PERSON IN THAT THE PRESIDENT'S

876
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
SPEECH WAS HIGHLY POLITICAL.

877
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
SPEAKING FROM THE HEART AS A

878
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
FATHER EXPRESSING HIS SYMPATHIES

879
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I DO LIKE WHAT HE SAID TO WHAT

880
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
DEGREE WE CAN SHARE IN YOUR PAIN

881
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
TO EASE YOUR BURDEN.

882
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
THAT WAS IMPORTANT.
IT SHIFTED IN WHAT DO WE NEED TO

883
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
DO HERE.

884
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

885
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
HOPEFULLY IT DOESN'T ZERO ONLY

886
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
IN ON GUN CONTROL.

887
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
IT'S NOT THE ONLY ISSUE.

888
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
THAT PERSON SAID THERE'S ALSO

889
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IT IS

890
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
VERY IMPORTANT IT CANNOT

891
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
DISREGARD THE INFLUENCE OF THE

892
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IN

893
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
SITUATIONS INVOLVING MASS

894
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
SHOOTINGS AND TELEVISION AND

895
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
VIDEO GAMES THEY HAVE A BIG

896
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
IMPACT ON IT.

897
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
A OO THE BOEHNER PROPOSAL IT

898
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
GOES UP ONLY IF YOU MAKE A

899
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
MILLION OR MORE.
>> I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A

900
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
GREAT DEAL IF THAT'S WHAT HE IS

901
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
WILLING TO DO.

902
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
THEY ARE ON THE LEFT WHICH IS

903
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
IMPORTANT A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY

904
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
WHAT DOES HE CARE?

905
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
THEY HAVE TO GET IT THROUGH

906
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
CONGRESS.

907
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
THE ANSWER WOULD BE HE'S GOING

908
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
TO HAVE TO BE RESPONSIVE TO

909
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
THAT.
THEY WANT TO SEE BECAUSE THE

910
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
PRESIDENT HAS CAVE THE ON THE

911
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
ISSUE IN THE PAST IN THE LEFT

912
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
THEY WANT TO SEE THE TAX RATE

913
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
GOING UP ON EVERYBODY OVER 250.

914
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THAT IS

915
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
A GREAT DEAL IF YOU CAN GET 39

916
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
PERCENT ON ANYBODY OVER A

917
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
MILLION.

918
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
>> ME, TOO.

919
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
>> I TELL YOU WHAT, I WILL LET

920
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
YOU RESPOND ON THAT.

921
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
PLUS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THERE

922
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
ARE SOME ACTUALLY SAYING THAT

923
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
HILLARY CLINTON IS FAKING HER

924

00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000

1040
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000

1041
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
STRETCHERS TO COME OUT OR THE

1042
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000

DO YOU THINK THIS IS WHAT THAT

1044
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
IS?

I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THE IDEA

1047
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000

BE ALLOWED TO NOT TESTIFY.

1076
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
THIS IS ABSURD THIS IDEA -- BUY

1077
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
THE IDEA SHE CAN'T EVER TESTIFY

1078
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000

1079
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000

1085
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT.

1086
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
