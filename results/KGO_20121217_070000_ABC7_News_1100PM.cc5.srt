627
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000

633
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
THEY CLINCHED A WILD CARD SPOT

634
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
IN THE PLAYOFFS.

635
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
>> WE KNEW WE WERE GOING TO

636
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
HAVE TO PUT UP POINTS.

637
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
TOM BRADY AND THE OFFENSE CAN

638
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
PUT UP A LOT OF POINTS.

639
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
WE KNEW WE WERE GOING TO MATCH

640
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000

641
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
WE SPOTTED THEM 28 POINTS.

644
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
YOU CAN'T PLAY POORLY AGAINST

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
A GOOD TEAM AND EXPECT TO

646
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
WIN.

647
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
>> WE CAN WIN A SHOOTOUT.

648
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

649
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
THAT'S OUR MOTTO.

650
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000

HE GOES 57 YARDS THE OTHER

657
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000

658
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
THEY FACE THE SEAHAWKS NEXT

659
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000

660
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
THEY CAN CLINCH WITH A WIN.

661
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000

00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
WE WILL TAKE A BRIEF TIMEOUT

BEFORE WE JUMP OVER TO THE

666
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000

THEY ENDED A SIX-GAME LOSING

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000

TWO OF THE FOUR WINS ARE

685
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
12-0 RAIDERS.

686
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
THE RAIDERS DEFENSE SHUT OUT

687
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000

HIS FIRST SACK OF THE SEASON
WENT TO A RAIDER'S GAME AND A

690
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000

SOMETHING WHERE THEY GET A

694
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
LITTLE CONFIDENCE.

695
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I THOUGHT THEY HAD A GREAT

696
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
WEEK OF PRACTICE.

697
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000

ON WHAT WEED -- WHAT WE NEEDED

699
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
A GREAT JOB EXECUTING THEM

701
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000

703
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
IT IS GOOD TO GET A WIN VERSUS

704
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
A TEAM THAT WAS STRUGGLING AND

705
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000

IT HAS HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS.

DENVER HAS THE AFC LOCKED UP.

HE MAKES UP FOR A FUMBLE IN

1116
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
THE RED ZONE EARLIER.

1117
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
34-YARD STRIKE.

1118
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
LET'S GO TO THE THIRD

1119
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
QUARTER.
HIS THIRD TD PASS OF THE

1120
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
GAME.

1121
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
THREADS THE NEEDLE AND 27

1122
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
YARDS AND 31-349ERS.

1123
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
GAME IS OVER, RIGHT?

1124
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
>> HUH-UH.

1125
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
28 UNANSWERED BY THE

1126
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
PATRIOTS.
DOWN THE SIDELINES AND HE HAD

1127
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
10 CATCHES.

1128
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
190 YARDS FOR THE FORMER 9ER.

1129
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
WE HAVE A TIE TBAIM.

1130
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
TIE GAME.
AFTER THEY RETURNED THE

1131
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
ENSUING KICKOFF AND THE NEXT

1132
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
PLAY AND FOUR TD PASSES TO

1133
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
CRABTREE.

1134
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
216 YARDS AND SEVEN CATCHES

1135
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
AND 107 YARDS AND TWO TD'S.

1136
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
THEY ADD A LATE FIELD GOAL.

1137
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
THEY CLINCH A WILD CARD SPOT.

1138
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
>> A GREAT VICTORY.

1139
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I REALLY LOVE HOW THE TEAM

1140
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
SUCKED IT UP.

1141
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
WE DIDN'T MAKE ALL OF THE

1142
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
PLAYS.

1143
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
WE MADE A LOT OF PLAYS.

1144
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
>> THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE

1145
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
THEIR PLAYS.

1146
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
WE PUT IT TO THEM IN THE FIRST

1147
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
HALF.

1148
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
>> AND DEFENSE WE KNOW WE NEED

1149
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
A COUPLE MORE STOPS AND THAT'S

1150
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
WHAT WE DID.

1151
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
>> AROUND THE NFC, SEATTLE

1152
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
KEEPING THE PRESSURE ON THE

1153
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
9ERS AND BEATING THE BILLS.

1154
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
HE RAN FOR THREE TOUCH DOWNS.

1155
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
WHAT A YEAR THIS ROOKIE IS

1156
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
HAVING.
DEFENSE CAME UP BIG.

1157
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
HE GOES 57 YARDS THE OTHER

1158
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
WAY.

1159
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
50-17 THE FINAL.

1160
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
A WIN AND THEY CLINCH THE NFC

1161
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
WEST.
A LOSS AND IT GOES DOWN TO THE

1162
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
FINAL WEEKEND.

1163
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
FALCONS HAVE THE TOP SEED IN

1164
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
THE NFC AND SHOWED WHY AGAINST

1165
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
THE GIANTS.

1166
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
TO TONY GONZALEZ AND 14-0

1167
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
ATLANTA AFTER ONE QUARTER.

1168
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
RYAN COULD DO NO WRONG.

1169
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
270 YARDS TD'S AND TWO TO

1170
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
JULIO JONES.

1171
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
FALCONS DOWN AT HOME AND HANG

1172
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
ON TO THE TOP SPOT IN THE

1173
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
NFC.
A 34-0 SHUTOUT OF THE GIANTS.

1174
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
TIGERS AND BEARS.

1175
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
WHAT A GAME FOR JAMES JONES.

1176
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
FIVE RECEPTIONS AND GREEN BAY

1177
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
CLINCHES THE NFC NORTH FOR THE

1178
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
SECTD SEASON WITH A 21-13

1179

VICTORY AND ARE A THIRD SEED

1180
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
IN THE NFC WITH THE 49ER I CAN

1181
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
HAVE TORY.

1182
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
STAR OF THE DAY, ADRIAN

1183
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
PETERSON.

1184
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
212 YARDS RUSHING AND ONE

1185
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
TOUCHDOWN.

1186
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
HE IS 200 YARDS SHY OF THE ALL

1187
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
TIME LEADINGS IN A SEASON.

1188
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
VIKINGS WIN IT 36-22 THE

1189
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
FINAL.

1190
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
THE RAIDERS FINALLY END THEIR

1191
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
SIX-GAME SLIDE IN A HOME

1192
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
GAME.

1193
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
THEY BEAT KANSAS CITY AND TWO

1194
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
OF THEIR FOUR WINS ARE AGAINST

1195
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
THE CHIEFS.

1196
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
THIS YOUNG RAIDER FAN IS

1197
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
OFFERING PRAYERS FOR THE

1198
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
VICTIMS OF NEWTOWN.

1199
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
HE RAD FOR 110 YARDS AND ON 30

1200
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
CARRIES AND FINALLY BUSTED

1201
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
OUT.

1202
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
THAT LEADS TO JANIKOWSKI'S

1203
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
FOURTH FIELD GOAL.

1204
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
RAIDERS' DEFENSE SHUT ON THE

1205
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
THE CHIEFS.
THE FIRST ONE SINCE 2002 FOR

1206
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
THE SILVER AND BLACK.

1207
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
RAIDERS SNAP THE SKID BEHIND

1208
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
JANIKOWSKI'S FIVE FIELD

1209
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
GOALS.

1210
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
>> I THINK OUR GUYS NEEDED

1211
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
SOMETHING WHERE THEY GET A

1212
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
LITTLE CONFIDENCE.

1213
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I THOUGHT THEY HAD A GREAT

1214
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
WEEK OF PRACTICE.

1215
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I THOUGHT THEY WERE FOCUSED ON

1216
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
WHAT WOO WE NEEDED TO DO AND

1217
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
HOW DO WE WIN THIS GAME.

1218
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
THEY DID A GREAT JOB.

1219
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
>> OUR DEFENSE OUT PLAYED

1220
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
THEM.
IT IS GOOD TO GET A WIN VERSUS

1221
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
A TEAM THAT WAS STRUGGLING.

1222
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
COMING IN HERE, IT HAS HAD A

1223
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
LOT OF SUCCESS.

1224
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
>> AROUND THE AFC, ANDREW LUCK

1225
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
AGAINST THE TOP SEEDED

1226
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
TEXANS.

1227
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
HE SCOOPS AND SCORES AND

1228
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000

TOUCHDOWNS INCLUDING THIS

1231
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
61-YARDER, BUT IT WASN'T

1232
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
ENOUGH.

1233
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
A 29-17 VICTORY.

1234
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
DENVER LOCKED UP THE AFC

1235
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
WEST.

1236
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
THEY MADE A STATEMENT THOUGH.

1237
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
IT IS A LONG WAY.

1238
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
HE DID MAKE IT TO THE END

1239
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
