1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
THERE ARE MANY TROPICAL

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
DESTINATIONS WHERE BLUE
WATERS, WHITE SAND AND

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
PERFECT WEATHER CREATE

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
LOCATIONS MANY CONSIDER
HEAVEN ON EARTH.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
AND THIS PLACE IS CLOSE

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
TO THE TOP OF THAT LIST.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
THE BRITISH
VIRGIN ISLANDS.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
MADE UP OF NEARLY 60 SMALL

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
ISLANDS EAST OF PUERTO RICO
THE BRITISH VIRGIN

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
ISLANDS, REGULARLY CALLED THE

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
BVIS ARE LARGELY UNINHABITED AND

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
BEST EXPLORED BY BOAT.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
WE TEAMED UP WITH ONE OF

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
THE TOP SAIL BOAT CHARTER

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
COMPANIES IN THE BVIS,

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
CONCH CHARTERS TO EXPERIENCE THE
MAGIC OF THIS ISLAND PARADISE

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
BY SAILING ITS CALM SEAS.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS
ARE POPULAR TO SAIL,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
CONSIDERED VERY EASY TO

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
NAVIGATE, WITH FAVORABLE
WINDS, EASY FOR EVEN

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
INEXPERIENCED SAILORS.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
SINCE OUR MOTION CAMERAMAN
JOHN NEILY HAPPENS

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
TO BE A VERY EXPERIENCED

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
SAILOR WE PLANNED A BARE

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
BOAT CHARTER HERE, MEANING

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
WE CREWED OUR OWN BOAT TO

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
EXPLORE SEVERAL OF THE
ISLANDS AND DISCOVER THE

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
BEAUTY FOUND ABOVE AND

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE
BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
CONCH CHARTERS HOOKED US UP WITH

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
A BEAUTIFUL 43 FOOT CATAMARAN

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
CALLED THE CATY WAMPUS.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
WITH PLENTY OF ROOM INSIDE

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
AND OUT FOR THE MOTION
CREW AND TWO GUEST HIKERS.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
GINA AND KATIE ARE BEST

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
FRIENDS WHO HAVEN'T SEEN

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
EACH OTHER IN OVER TWO

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
YEARS AND RECONNECTED FOR

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
A TRIP WITH US TO THE

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS.

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
EXCITED AND A LITOAT I WAS

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
EXCITED AND A LITTLE NERVOUS TO
SPEND THREE DAYS ON A BOAT WITH

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
PEOPLE IVE NEVER MET, BUT ONCE I
MET GREG AND THE CREW EVERYTHING

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
WAS FINE, WE WERE ALL FRIEND.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A BIG

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
SAIL BOAT BEFORE I THOUGHT

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I HOPE SOMEONE KNOWS WHAT

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
THEY'RE DOING
BECAUSE I DON'T.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
THEN WE MET THE CREW AND

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
WERE REALLY EXCITED.

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
AFTER GETTING OUR GEAR
STOWED BELOW DECK WE EASED

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
THE CATY WAMPUS OUT OF

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
THE HARBOR AND POINTED HER
TOWARD THE FIRST

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
DESTINATION AN OUTCROPPING

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
OR ROCKS WITH SOME GREAT

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
SNORKELING IN THE BVI'S

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
CALLED THE INDIANS.

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
AFTER USING THE TWIN

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
DIESEL ENGINES TO SAFELY
MOTOR OUT OF PORT PUTTING

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
THE CARIBBEAN
BREEZE INTO MOTION.

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
JOHN WASTED LITTLE TIME

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
BEFORE PUTTING THE GUEST
HIKERS AND I TO WORK.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
GINA, AND I AND KATIE
WERE JUST SITTING THERE

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
WATCHING THE WAVES GO BY

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
BUT NOW WE HAVE TO

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
GO HOIST SOMETHING.

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
ONE HAND ON THE
ZIPPER ONE ON THE.

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'M JUST GOING TO WATCH.

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
CAN I TAKE THAT MIDDLE

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
MANAGEMENT POSITION?

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
UP INTO THE WIND AND

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
THEN HOIST HER UP.

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
OKAY?

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
GET ALL THAT?

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
GOT IT?

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
OKAY.

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
JUST TELL ME WHAT TO PULL.

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
EVERYONE ON BOARD HELPED SAIL

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
THE CATY WAMPUS WHICH MADE A TRP
LIKE THIS SO FUN.

80
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
BEFORE HOISTING THE SAIL

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
HE HOISTED IT INTO THE

82
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
WIND SO IT WOULD BE EASIER

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
HOISTING THE

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
ENORMOUS MAIN SHEET.

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
GIVE THAT A GOOD SOLID

86
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
CRANK, LIKE YOU MEAN IT.

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
SORRY I HAVE TO SQUINT A

88
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
LITTLE BIT RIGHT NOW CAUSE I
CAUGHT A GLARE OFF KATIE'S TOES.

89
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
ONE IS FASTER
THAN THE OTHER.

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
YOU'VE GOT THIS BRO.

91
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
GO KATIE GO.

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
SEE THIS IS TOUGH

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
WORK SAILING.

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
YOU DON'T GET TO
JUST SAIL, HAVE TO

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
CRANK AND HOIST.

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
YEA SERIOUSLY.

97
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
WHEN THEY ASKED ME TO DO
SOMETHING, I THOUGHT OH

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
NO, I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
ASKED, BUT IT WAS A
CHALLENGE BUT FUN, AND

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
HIGH ENERGY AND EVERYONE

101
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
WAS HELPFUL AND IT
WAS NEAT TO BE PART

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
OF THE SAILING.

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
THE MAIN SAIL OUT AND THE
SMALLER TRIANGLE SHAPE JIB

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
DEPLOYED THE LOW RUMBLE OF

105
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
THE ENGINE QUITE AND THE

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
PEACE OF SAILING SET IN.

107
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
PART OF WHAT MAKING

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
THE BVIS EASY TO SAIL
IS NAVIGATION IS EASY.

109
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
YOU CAN SEE MOST OF THE

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
ISLANDS AT ALL TIMES.

111
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
THE INDIANS A NEAR BY

112
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
NORMAN ISLAND ARE A SHORT
DISTANCE FROM THIS TOWN.

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
WITH THE CATY WAMPUS

114
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
SAILING AT SIX KNOTS IT

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
TOOK A LITTLE MORE THAN AN

116
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
HOUR, WHERE WE TIED UP

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
LAUNCHED OUR SMALL DINGY AND
GOT INTO AN UNDERWATER REEF.

118
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
STRUCK ME ABOUT THE BVIS WAS

120
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
HOW CLEAR THE WATER WAS.

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
WE CAN SEE THE BOTTOM OF

122
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
THE OCEAN AND 70 FEET OF
WATER AND ONCE WE GOT IN

123
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
HERE IN ONLY 15 FEET OF

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
WATER THE COLORS BELOW THE
SURFACE WAS EYE POPPING.

125
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
IT WAS TRULY BEAUTIFUL.

126
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I HAD NEVER SNORKELED
IN A REEF LIKE THAT.

127
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
TO SEE THE CLIFFS AND

128
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
STUFF IT WAS AMAZING.

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
THE MIXED UNDERWATER

130
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
TOPOGRAPHY HERE IS WHAT

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
MAKES THE INDIANS ONE OF

132
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
THE TOP PLACES TO

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
SNORKEL IN ALL OF THE
BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS.

134
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROCKS

135
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
THE SHALLOW REEF IS HOME
TO TROPICAL FISH, LARGE

136
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
CORAL AND A STAGGERING
AMOUNT OF UNDERSEA LIFE.

137
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
WHEN YOU FIRST EXPERIENCE

138
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
A PLACE LIKE THIS IT IS
EASY TO BE OVERWHELMED BY

139
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
THE LARGE SCALE

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
OF EVERYTHING.

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
BUT IF YOU JUST STOP AND
FOCUS ON ONE PIECE OF

142
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
CORAL AND HANG OUT THERE

143
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
FOR A FEW MINUTES YOU

144
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
START TO SEE THINGS MOST
PEOPLE MISS AS THEY TRY TO

145
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
QUICKLY COVER
THE ENTIRE AREA.

146
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
INDIANS THE SEA FLOOR
DROPS AWAY OVER 700 FEET

148
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
IN DEPTH GIVING A
WHOLE NEW ADVENTURE.

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
CRUISING ALONG THIS ROCK
WALL REVEALED NEW KINDS OF

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
CORAL AND FISH THAT MADE

151
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
THIS ONE OF THE BEST
SNORKELS WE'VE EVER DONE.

152
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
AFTER AN HOUR IN THE AFTER

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
WE HEADED BACK TO THE

154
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
CATY WAMPUS FOR A QUICK

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
RIDE INTO A COVE
CALLED THE BIGHT.

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
FIELDS ARE SPREAD OUT ON

157
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
THE ISLAND ON PROTECTED

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
SHORES AND ARE WHERE

159
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
PEOPLE TIE UP AND

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
CAMP FOR THE NIGHT.

161
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
WITH PLENTY OF DAYLIGHT

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
REMAINING WE GOT READY FOR
ANOTHER SNORKEL OUTING ON

163
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
SEA CAVES BY THE POINT.

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
THIS HARBOR IS CALLED THE

165
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
BIGHT ON NORMAN ISLAND IN
THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS.

166
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
HOW IS IT GOING GIRLS?

167
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
GOOD.

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
WHAT DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT GOING INTO A

169
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
BIG CAVE RIGHT NOW?

170
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
EXCITED, VERY EXCITED
OKAY AND BARRACUDAS

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
DON'T BOTHER YOU.

172
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
AND SHARKS DON'T

173
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
BOTHER YOU?

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
OKAY MAYBE THOSE.

175
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
OKAY CAUSE WERE ALL
NERVOUS ABOUT THE SHARKS

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
WERE GOING TO ENCOUNTER.

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
DID YOU HEAR THAT LOUD

178
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
EXPLOSION OVER THERE?

179
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
THAT WAS SIGNALING
HAPPY HOUR.

180
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
A SHORT RIDE IN THE DINGY LEAD

181
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
US HERE A CLIFF WALL IN THE SOUH
SHORES OF NORMAN ISLAND.

182
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
BARRACUDAS ARE COMMON IN

I KNEW WE WERE GOING
DIVING AND THOUGHT A LOT

ABOUT IT, BUT RIGHT BEFORE

253
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
WE GOT THERE AND WE SIGNED

254

YOU'RE OKAY I'VE NEVER

WE GOT INTO THE WATER

262

AFTER THE BASICS ON THE BEACH IT
WAS TIME TO GEAR UP FOR OUR FIRT

A TYPICAL RESORT COURSE
LIKE THIS LIMITS IT 40

FEET, BUT BEFORE WE GO

269
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
DOWN THAT DEEP WE NEED TO
LEARN HOW TO BREATH IN THE

270
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
WAIST DEEP WATER BY THE DOCK.

AFTER GETTING SOME BASIC

277
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
SAFETY TRAINING DOWN WE
LEARNED A LITTLE DEEPER

278
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
AND USED OUR GEAR
TO KEEP US BUOYANT

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000

OF THE WATER AND ON THE DIVE BOT

OVER THE WRECK IT WENT OVER

285

WHEN THE ROAN WENT DOWN

SHE BROKE IN HALF WITH THE
BOW IN 80 FEET OF WATER,

287
