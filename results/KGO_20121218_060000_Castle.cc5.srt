1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
BUT YOUR DORM ROOM
IS ONLY SO BIG.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE
SOME OF THIS STUFF BEHIND.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
(Martha) DON'T LISTEN TO HIM,
DARLING.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EVERYBODY NEEDS THEIR STUFF.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
SEE?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
(Martha sighs)

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
MY LITTLE GIRL
IS GOING TO COLLEGE.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
SEEMS LIKE JUST YESTERDAY,

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
YOU WERE CHECKING UNDER
THE BED EVERY NIGHT,

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
PROMISING HER
THAT MONSTERS AREN'T REAL.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
WELL, I LIED.
MONSTERS ARE REAL.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
THEY'RE THE BOYS
IN HER FRESHMAN DORM.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
OH, SPEAKING OF WHICH,

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
BEFORE ALEXIS LEAVES, DON'T YOU
THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE THE, UH,

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
TALK WITH HER?

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
YOU MEAN THE SEX TALK? MOTHER,
I COVERED THAT AGES AGO.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I LEARNED SO MUCH.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I MEAN THE YOU-AND-BECKETT
SEX TALK.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
MOTHER, BECKETT AND I AR--

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
SAVE IT, RICHARD.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I KNEW THE MORNING
I WALKED IN HERE

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
AND THE POOR GIRL
WAS HIDING IN THE--

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
YOU--
SHH.

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
(lowered voice)
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?
SHH, SHH, SHH.

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
(lowered voice)
MOTHERS KNOW THESE THINGS.

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU WANT
ALEXIS TO WALK IN UNANNOUNCED

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
AND FIND YOU AND BECKETT...
OUT OF THE CLOSET.

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
AND BY "OUT OF THE CLOSET"--

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I--NO, I-I-I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
BY "OUT OF THE CLOSET."

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
OKAY, SO...

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD TELL HER?

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
TELL ME WHAT?

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
(Beckett)
YOU TOLD ALEXIS?

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I DIDN'T WANT TO. MOTHER USED
HER JEDI MIND TRICKS ON ME.

35
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
SHE KNOWS, TOO?

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
CASTLE, DO THEY REALIZE
WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE?

37
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
BECAUSE IF ALEXIS
TELLS LANIE...

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
ALEXIS WON'T TELL LANIE.

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
LANIE'S GONNA TELL ESPOSITO,

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
ESPOSITO CAN'T KEEP
HIS MOUTH SHUT WITH RYAN,

41
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
AND RYAN'S GONNA BLOW IT
OUT OF PROPORTION,

42
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
AND THEN GATES
IS GONNA FIND OUT,

43
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
AND WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO WORK TOGETHER ANYMORE.

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
TRUST ME.

45
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
SHE KNOWS WHAT'S AT STSTAKE,

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
AND OUR SECRET IS SAFE.

47
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
(people speaking indistinctly)

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
SO HOW DID SHE TAKE IT,

49
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
US BEING TOGETHER?

50
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
SHE WAS TOO PREOCCUPIED
WITH HER MOVE TO EVEN COMMENT.

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I MEAN, IT'S RIDICULOUS.

52
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
SHE'S GOT BOXES AND BOXES
OF STUFF,

53
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
AND APPARENTLY,
ALL OF IT'S IMPORTANT.

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
YEAH, WELL, WE ALL NEED
OUR STUFF, CASTLE.

55
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'VE GOT BOXES
AND BOXES OF IT.

56
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
IT'S COMFORTING.

57
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
IT REMINDS ME OF MY PAST.

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
YOUR KINKY PAST?

59
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'VE GOT THAT BOX, TOO.

60
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
(siren wails)

61
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
(camera shutter clicking)

62
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
HOUSEKEEPING FOUND HER
THIS MORNING.

63
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
NAME'S WENDY DUPREE,
25 YEARS OF AGE,

64
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
SINGLE GUNSHOT TO THE CHEST

65
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
FROM A 9 MILLIMETER.

66
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
UNFORTUNATELY,
SHE DIED SLOWLY.

67
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
(Beckett) YEAH, LONG ENOUGH
TO WRITE THE WORD "LIE."

68
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
SO OUR KILLER WASN'T A PRO.

69
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN LEFT BREATHING.

70
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
A DYING DECLARATION,
BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

71
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
HEY,
THAT'S YOUR DEPARTMENT.

72
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
WELL, DID SOMEONE
LIE TO HER?

73
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
PERHAPS IT'S
THE KILLER'S INITIALS.

74
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
MM.

75
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
MAYBE A GRAMMATICAL ERROR.

76
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
SHE SHOULD'VE WRITTEN "LAY."

77
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
(Esposito) YO, BECKETT.

78
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
VICTIM'S WALLET.

79
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
(camera shutter clicks)

80
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
SHE CAME A LONG WAY
TO GET KILLED.

81
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
SHE'S A PHILLY GIRL.

82
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
HOW LONG
WAS SHE HERE FOR?

83
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
FRONT DESK SAYS SHE CHECKED IN
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON ALONE.

84
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
SHE WASN'T ALONE.

85
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
SHE BROUGHT 4,000
OF HER CLOSEST FRIENDS.

86
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
THAT KIND OF CASH, WHAT'S SHE
DOING IN A DUMP LIKE THIS?

87
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
ALL RIGHT, RUN FINANCIALS.
SEE WHAT YOU GUYS CAN FIND.
YEAH.

88
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
CASTLE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

89
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I THINK, AS MUCH AS I LOVE
A GOOD MYSTERY,

90
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
SHE COULD'VE LEFT
A MORE HELPFUL NOTE.

91
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
HERE'S A MESSAGE THAT NEEDS
NO INTERPRETATION.

92
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
"YOU THINK YOU CAN LIE TO ME?"

93
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
AH. MAYBE THAT'S THE LIE.

94
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
"RUN ALL YOU WANT. I'M GONNA
FIND YOU AND MAKE YOU PAY."

95
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
IT'S A 2-1-5 AREA CODE.
THAT'S PHILLY.

96
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
PULL A WARRANT
FOR THE CELL PHONE.

97
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I WANT TO KNOW
WHO SENT THAT TEXT.

98
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
YEAH, I SENT IT.
YOU BET I DID.

99
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD
A BIG PROBLEM WITH HER.

100
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
HELL, YEAH, I HAD A PROBLEM.

101
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
WENDY'S A WAITRESS AT MY PLACE,
JOEL'S CHEESESTEAKS--

102
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
THE BEST IN PHILLY.

103
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
"THE BEST IN PHILLY"?
THAT'S A TAD PRESUMPTUOUS.

104
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
WELL, IT IS.

105
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
SO YESTERDAY I SENT
THAT FRAUL TO THE BANK

106
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
TO MAKE A DEPOSIT
FOR THE RESTAURANT, RIGHT?

107
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
BUT DOES SHEHE MAKE THDROP?
NO.

108
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
SHE HIGHTAILS IT UP HERE
WITH 4,000 OF MY DOLLARS.

109
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
THAT'S A LOT OF CHEESESTEAK.

110
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
SO YOU FOLLOWED HER TO NEW YORK
TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK.

111
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
DAMN RIGHT.
I TRIED TO BE NICE.

112
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
FINALLY, SHE CALLS ME,

113
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
AND SHE'S LIKE, "I'M SORRY.
IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.

114
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'LL PAY YOU BACK DOUBLE
WHEN I GET BACK."

115
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
SCREW THAT.
SHE STOLE FROM ME.

116
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
AND FOR THAT,
SHE DESERVED TO DIE?

117
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
YEAH.

118
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
WAIT. WHAT?

119
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
OH, NO.

120
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
NO.

121
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I DIDN'T DO THIS.

122
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
NAH. I COULDN'T EVEN
FIND HER.

123
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
NO, I-I JUST GOT OFF
THE TRAIN FROM PHILLY, UH,

124
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
AN HOUR BEFORE YOUS GUYS
PICKED ME UP.

125
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
SO AMTRAK CONFIRMS THAT PRATT
WAS TICKETED YESTERDAY,

126
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
BUT THEY CAN'T BE SURE
OF WHAT TRAIN HE WAS ON.

127
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
SO WE'RE DOUBLE-CHECKING
HIS ALIBI.

128
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
HAVE THEM CHECK ON
THAT CHEESESTEAK, TOO.

129
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THERE'S NO WAY THAT IT'S
THE BEST IN PHILLY.

130
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
ANYWAY, EVEN IF IT WAS HIM,

131
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
IT DOESN'T EXPLAIN WENDY'S
MYSTERIOUS EMERGENCY--

132
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
THE STOLEN CASH,

133
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
THE SUDDEN TRIP
TO NEW YORK CITY.

134
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
MM. WHY SHE WOULD WRITE "LIE."

135
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
YOU DON'T WRITE A DYING MESSAGE
IN BLOOD JUST FOR KICKS.

136
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THERE HAD TO BE A REASON.

137
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
ARE YOU OUT, TOO?
WANT SOME MORE?

138
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
YEAH. UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL GO GET IT.

139
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
OH.

140
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
THANK YOU.

141
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
MM-HMM.

142
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
(people speaking indistinctly)

143
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY.

144
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
LITERARY INSTITUTE
OF EXCELLENCE.

145
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
LOVE IS EVERYTHING.

146
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
OH, DID I JUST SAY THAT?

147
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
(telephone rings)

148
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'M GETTING SOFT.

149
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
(ring)

150
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
DETECTIVE BECKETT'S PHONE.

151
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
CASTLE?

152
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ANSWER
BECKETT'S PHONE.

153
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
YES, I AM.

154
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
SINCE WHEN?

155
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
SINCE I...

156
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
CAN--IS THERE SOMETHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

157
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah.
Write this down.

158
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'VE GOT A PARTIAL
OFF THE SHELL CASING.

159
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
NO MATCHES IN THE SYSTEM

160
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
or to Mr. Pratt,

161
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
BUT I DID FIND
SOME TRACE D.N.A.

162
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Are you writing this down?

163
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
YES.

164
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
CASTLE.

165
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
OKAY, HANG ON.

166
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
(laughs)

167
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

168
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Ooh.

169
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
YOU ARE IN TROUBLE.

170
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'M NOT IN TROUBLE.

171
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
LANIE GOT A PARTIAL PRINT.

172
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
IT IS NOT A MATCH FOR PRATT.
HE IS NOT OUR GUY.

173
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
WHO SAID THAT YOU COULD
ANSWER MY PHONE?

174
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
AND WHY ARE YOU

BUT I MIGHT HAVE FIGURED OUT
WHAT SHE WAS DOING IN TOWN.

202
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
SHE USED HER CREDIT CARD

204

205
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I SPOKE WITH A CABBIE.
WENDY TOOK HIS BUSINESS CARD.

206
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
SAID SHE WAS GOING TO CALL

SHE WAS HERE.

A LOT LESS BLOODY
WHEN I SAW HER, THOUGH.

214
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
SHE SIGNED UP FOR THE AUCTION.

215
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
AUCTION?

216
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000

220
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
THAT'S WHAT THE $4,000
WAS FOR.

221
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
SHE WAS GONNA BID ON A UNIT.

222
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WHICH UNIT?

223
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
BEATS ME.

224
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
COULD BE ANY ONE OF THE 14
WE GOT UP FOR BID.

225
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
SO THERE'S NO WAY OF TELLING
WHICH ONE SHE WAS INTERESTED IN?

226
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
ACTUALLY, THERE IS A WAY.

227
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
WE MISINTERPRETED
WENDY'S MESSAGE.

228
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
IT'S NOT "LIE."

229
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
WE WERE LOOKING AT IT
UPSIDE DOWN.

230
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
IT'S "3-1-7." THAT'S WHAT
SHE WAS TRYING TO SAY.

231
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
IS UNIT 317 UP FOR AUCTION?

232
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
OH, AS A MATTER OF FACT,
IT IS.

233
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
PROBABLY AUCTIONING IT OFF
AS WE SPEAK.

234
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
WENDY WAS KILLED TRYING
TO BUY THAT UNIT.

235
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
IF WE LET IT GET SOLD OFF...

236
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000

HOW DID YOU EVEN KNOW

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
WELL, AS A CHAMPION
POKER PLAYER,

387
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I AM A STUDENT
OF BODY LANGUAGE.

388
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I COULD TELL EASILY
BY LOOKING AT HIM--

389
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
YOU HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA.

390
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
NOT A CLUE.

391
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
CONGRATS.

392
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
ALL THAT JUNK IS YOURS.

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
YEAH, THANKS.

394
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
OH, AND, UH,
MY MOTHER'S NAME...

395
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
IS EUNICE.

396
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
EXCUSE ME.

397
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
EUNICE?

398
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
DAMN, BRO. YOU ACTUALLY
BOUGHT ALL THIS CRAP?

399
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
ALL THIS CRAP IS GONNA CRACK
THIS CASE WIDE OPEN.

400
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
THANK YOU, L.T.

401
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
YOU ARE SO GOING TO OWE ME
FOR THIS.

402
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
CASTLE, I DON'T KNOW
IF THE DEPARTMENT'S

403
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
GONNA BE ABLE TO REIMBURSE YOU
FOR ALL OF THIS.

404
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
(whispers) THAT'S NOT
THE OWING I MEAN.

405
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
RAN DOWN THE NAME
ON UNIT 317--

406
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
JOHAN FLEMING.

407
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
ADDRESS IS BOGUS.
NAME IS BOGUS.

408
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
THE GUY DOESN'T EXIST.

409
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
THEN WHOSE STUFF IS THIS?

410
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
WELL, THE ANSWER'S
RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.

411
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
HIS STUFF WILL TELL US
WHO HE IS.

412
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
LOOK, THERE'S A BOX OF MAPS.

413
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
UM, HE WAS A GEOGRAPHY BUFF.

414
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
HE ENJOYED TRAVEL.

415
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
MAYBE HE WAS A TRUCKER.

416
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
AH. SEE? PROGRESS.

417
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
OOH. YO, CLIMBING GEAR.

418
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
HE'S AN OUTDOORSMAN.

419
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
A SUPER CREEPY OUTDOORSMAN.

420
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
EW.

421
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
HEY, THIS IS HIGH-END STUFF,
CASTLE.

422
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
CAN I HAVE THIS?

423
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
NO.

424
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
WHY NOT?
YOU'RE NOT A CLIMBER.

425
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I SPENT A LOT OF MONEY
ON THIS STUFF.

426
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
YOU WANT SOMETHING?
MAKE ME AN OFFER.

427
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
(Gates) WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

428
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
WHOSE JUNK IS THIS,

429
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
AND WHAT IN THE HELL IS
IT DOING IN MY PRECINCT?

430
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
IT'S CASTLE'S, SIR.

431
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
MR. CASTLE.

432
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
UH, SIR, ACTUALLY,

433
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
IT'S A PART OF
AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION.

434
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I DON'T CARE.
I WANT IT GONE, ALL OF IT.

435
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
(people speaking indistinctly)

436
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
IS THAT...

437
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
OH, IT IS.

438
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE?

439
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
HOW RARE THAT PIECE IS?

440
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
(Beckett) SIR?

441
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
ARE YOU A COLLECTOR?

442
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
EVER SINCE I WAS A KID.

443
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I HAVE SEARCHED...

444
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
FOR YEARS.

445
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
WELL...

446
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
SEARCH NO MORE.

447
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
NO.
YES.

448
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
IT'S YOURS.

449
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
REALLY? WELL, I--

450
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I DON'T KNOW W--I--

451
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
SAY YOU'LL ACCEPT.

452
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
OH.

453
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
THANK YOU.

454
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

455
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
UH... CARRY ON.

456
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
OH, YOU CAN GIVE HER SOMETHING,
BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE ME SOMETHING?

457
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
YEAH, YOU ALREADY LIKE ME.

458
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
HEY, GUYS. MOTHER LODE.

459
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
TAX RETURNS.

460
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
LOOKS LIKE JOHAN FLEMING'S
ACTUALLY WENDELL DUPREE.

461
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
THAT'S THE SAME LAST NAME
AS OUR VICTIM.

462
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
YES, AND THE SAME DATE OF BIRTH,
TOO. THEY MUST BE TWINS.

463
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
WAIT. TWINS.

464
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
(snaps fingers)

465
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
OF COURSE.
IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW.

466
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
WENDELL'S SECRET IDENTITY--
JOHAN FLEMING--

467
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
IS THE SAME SECRET IDENTITY
OF ZAN,

468
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
THE MALE HALF

469
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
OF THE WONDER TWINS.

470
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
WONDER TWINS?

471
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
THE "SUPER FRIENDS"?

472
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
SERIOUSLY, YOU GUYS,

473
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
DO YOU NOT WATCH TV?

474
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
IF THIS UNIT BELONGED
TO HER BROTHER,

475
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
THEN WHY
WAS WENDY BIDDING ON IT?

476
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
WHY DID HE STOP MAKING PAYMENTS?
AND WHY WAS HE USING AN ALIAS?

477
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
WHY DON'T WE TRACK DOWN WENDELL
AND ASK HIM?

478
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
(under breath)
WHY DON'T YOU BUY A TV?

479
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
WHO KNEW THAT GATES HAD
A SOFTER SIDE?

480
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
(speaks indistinctly)

481
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
(normal voice) OH, GOD.
JUST BEAUTIFUL.

482
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
IT'S, UM...

483
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
CREEPY, VERY, VERY...

484
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
CREEPY.

485
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
SO WHERE ARE WE
ON THE BROTHER?

486
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
OH, IT TURNS OUT THE TWINS
HAD A HARD KNOCK LIFE.

487
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
THEIR PARENTS DIED
IN A CAR CRASH

488
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
WHEN THEY WERE TEENS.

489
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
IT'S LIKE WENDELL
NEVER REALLY FULLY RECOVERED.

490
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
HE MOVED FROM TOWN TO TOWN,
GETTING IN SCRAPES WITH THE LAW.

491
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
SO WHERE CAN WE FIND HIM?

492
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
IN AN URN.

493
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
HE DIED SIX WEEKS AGO.

494
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
HIT BY A SUBWAY TRAIN.

495
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
OUCH.

496
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
EXPLAINS WHY HIS STORAGE BILL
WASN'T PAID.

497
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
IT SAYS HERE
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT?

498
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
WELL, THE SUBWAY CAMERAS
WERE BROKEN,

499
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
SO THERE'S REALLY NO WAY
TO KNOW FOR SURE.

500
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
IF HIS DEATH
IS RELATED TO WENDY'S,

501
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
WE COULD BE LOOKING
AT A SECOND MURDER.

502
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
(sighs) OKAY, SO THAT WAS

503
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
ONE OF WENDY'S
FELLOW WAITRESSES FROM PHILLY.

504
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
ACCORDING TO HER,
WENDY WAS CONVINCED

505
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
THAT HER BROTHER'S DEATH
WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

506
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
APPARENTLY, HE WAS INVOLVED
IN SOMETHING DANGEROUS.

507
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
WHAT KIND OF DANGEROUS?

508
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
WENDY DIDN'T SAY,
BUT ACCORDING TO THIS WAITRESS,

509
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
JUST BEFORE THE SUBWAY ACCIDENT,
WENDELL CALLED HIS SISTER

510
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
AND SAID IT WAS OVER AND ALL
OF THEIR PROBLEMS WERE SOLVED.

511
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
(Esposito)
AND YET, HE ENDS UP DEAD

512
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
AND SHE WAS DESPERATE ENOUGH
TO RISK EVERYTHING--

513
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
HER JOB, JAIL--

514
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
JUST TO GO AFTER
HER BROTHER'S STORAGE UNIT.

515
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
WHY?

516
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
ALL THIS STUFF.

517
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
A BUNCH OF RANDOM JUNK.

518
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
WELL, MAYBE IT'S JUST THAT

519
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

520
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I MEAN, WHOEVER KILLED WENDY

521
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
MOST LIKELY CAME
FROM WENDELL'S WORLD.

522
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIM?

523
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS,
USING HIS WONDER TWIN ALIAS,

524
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
WENDELL WORKED AS A CHAUFFER
FOR ONE ANGELICA HENLEY,

525
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
A WEALTHY SOCIALITE.

526
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
OKAY.

527
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
THEN LET'S START HERE.

528
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
(light jazz music playing)

529
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
(indistinct conversations)

530
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
GOOD EVENING.

531
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
MAY I HELP YOU?

532
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
UH, WE WERE HOPING TO SPEAK
WITH MS. HENLEY.

533
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
THE LADY IN THE PURPLE
COCKTAIL DRESS.

534
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
MAY I TAKE YOU TO HER?

535
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK WE CAN MANAGE.

536
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
CHAMPAGNE?

537
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'M ON DUTY.

538
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
AH, ALAS, I'M FORCED
TO DRINK ALONE.

539
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
ANGELICA HENLEY.

540
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
ANHELICA.

541
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
THE "G" IS SILENT.

542
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
WOULDN'T THAT MAKE IT
ANELICA?

543
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
ANHELICA.

544
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
WELL,
I'M DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT,

545
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
AND THIS IS MR. CASTLE.

546
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
COULD WE HAVE A WORD?

547
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT?
I HAVE GUESTS.

548
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
NOW I UNDERSTAND

549
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
THAT YOU EMPLOYED A MAN
NAMED JOHAN FLEMING.

550
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
YES, AND I WAS SO HEARTBROKEN
WHEN THE POOR BOY DIED.

551
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
WELL, WERE YOU AWARE THAT HIS
REAL NAME WAS WENDELL DUPREE?

552
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
NO, I WASN'T.

553
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
DID HE HAVE ANY ENEMIES?

554
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
NO, I-I DON'T THINK SO.

555
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
WAIT. YOU MEAN, HIS--
HIS NAME WAS WENDELL?

556
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
WAS HE IN TROUBLE?

557
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
WAS HE INVOLVED
IN ANY ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES.

558
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
NO, NO, NO.
THE POLICE CLEARED HIM.

559
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
OF WHAT?

560
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
OH, WELL, TWO DAYS BEFORE
HE DIED, I WAS ROBBED.

561
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
SOMEBODY BROKE IN HERE
AND CRACKED MY WALL SAFE.

562
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
WHAT DID THEY TAKE?

563
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
MY BRACELET MADE OUT OF
PINK DIAMONDS

564
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
THAT WAS WORTH
OVER $4 MILLION.

565
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
WENDELL STOLE THE BRACELET.

566
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
(Beckett) THAT'S WHAT'S
IN THE STORAGE UNIT.

567
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
THAT'S WHY HE WAS KILLED.

568
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
He is a good little monkey
and always very curious.

569
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
One day George got an important
letter...

570
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
He's built a rocket ship to
travel into space.

571
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's just the right size for a
clever monkey.

572
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Do you want to go into space,
George?

573
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You will have to be very brave.

574
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Hi, Grandma!

575
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Oh hi,. my little monkey!

576
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Here.

577
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Thank you very much.

578
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You're welcome.

579
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Everyone got on and they were
off to the launching site.

580
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Google, how far is Earth to the
Moon?

581
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Moon is 238,900 miles...

582
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The great moment had come...

583
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
...5...4...3...2...1

584
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Even though our mom tries,

585
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
she doesn't really get us.

586
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And she'll never know
who we are, or what...

587
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
No way,
Madden Girls??

588
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Nike!

589
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
They're so awesome!

590
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Nike!
Wow!

591
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yeahhhh!
Thank you!

592
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Who's your mommy now?

593
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's a
Christmas miracle.

594
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Give Victoriously.

595
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Famous brands. Famously easy.
Famous Footwear.

596
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Victory is Yours.

597
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
YEAH WE BOTH RELIEVE COUGHS,
SNEEZING,

598
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
ACHES, FEVERS.

599
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
AND I RELIEVE
NASAL CONGESTION.

600
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
OVERACHIEVER.

601
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
[ Female Announcer ] TYLENOL®
COLD MULTI-SYMPTOM NIGHTTIME

602
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
RELIEVES NASAL CONGESTION.

603
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
NYQUIL® COLD AND FLU DOESN'T.

604
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
OH. WHOA-HO.

605
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
WHOOP.

606
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
WHOO.

607
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
(sighs) WHAT ARE YOU
SO HAPPY ABOUT?

608
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
THERE IS A $4-MILLION
DIAMOND BRACELET

609
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
BURIED IN MY AUCTION WINNINGS.

610
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'M RICH.

611
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
OR RICHER.

612
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
TILL DETECTIVE BECKETT
TAKES IT FROM YOU

613
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
AND RETURNS IT
TO ITS RIGHTFUL OWNER.

614
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
YES, BUT NOT EVEN THAT
CAN RUIN MY DAY

615
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
BECAUSE TONIGHT

616
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
IS MY VERY SPECIAL

617
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
LAST-NIGHT-BEFORE-COLLEGE
DINNER WITH MY DAUGHTER.

618
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
ABOUT THAT.
CAN WE CANCEL?

619
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
WHAT? WHOA. WHAT? WHY?

620
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
ALEXIS, WE MADE THESE PLANS
MONTHS AGO.

621
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS, EVEN
FOR ME, TO GET RESERVATIONS--

622
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
IF IT'S THE RESERVATIONS
YOU CARE SO MUCH ABOUT,

623
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

624
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
HOLD ON, ALEXIS.
THAT'S NOT...

625
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
THAT'S NOT--

626
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
(door slams)

627
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

628
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
ALEXIS HATES ME?

629
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
IS IT
BECAUSE WE'RE TOGETHER?

630
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I GUESS SHE FEELS LIKE
SHE'S BEING REPLACED,

631
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
WHICH IS WEIRD

632
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
BECAUSE SHE'S NEVER
DONE THIS BEFORE--

633
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
NOT WITH GINA,

634
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
NOT WITH THE HUNDREDS OF
SUPER-HOT GIRLFRIENDS I'VE--

635
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
OKAY, I DON'T NEED
TO HEAR THIS.

636
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
(whispers) RIGHT.

637
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
SO DO YOU THINK I SHOULD
TALK TO HER?

638
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, SHE'LL EAT YOU ALIVE.

639
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
LET ME HANDLE IT.

640
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
HANDLE WHAT?

641
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
(Castle and Beckett)
NOTHING.

642
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
SO... UNIFORMS ARE GOING
THROUGH WENDELL'S BELONGINGS,

643
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
LOOKING FOR THE BRACELET,

644
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
BUT ROBBERY FINALLY SENT OVER
THE REPORT

645
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
ON THE BREAK-IN
ON ANGELICA HENLEY'S.

646
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE.

647
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
WOW. A REAL BEAUTY.

648
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
CERTAINLY WORTH KILLING FOR.

649
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I AM SPEAKING OF THE BRACELET
IN CASE ANYONE IS WONDERING.

650
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
IT WAS A 2-MAN JOB,
PRETTY SOPHISTICATED, TOO.

651
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
ONE SUSPECT PUT A BYPASS
ON THE ALARM IN THE BASEMENT.

652
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
THE OTHER
RAPPELLED FROM THE ROOF

653
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
AND WENT IN THROUGH THE WINDOW.

654
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
WHICH EXPLAINS THE CLIMBING
EQUIPMENT YOU HAD YOUR EYE ON.

655
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
(Beckett) SO WENDELL
WAS SUSPICIOUSLY HIT BY A TRAIN

656
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
AFTER STEALING
A DIAMOND BRACELET,

657
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
AND THEN SIX WEEKS LATER,

658
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
HIS SISTER GOES LOOKING
FOR HIS STORAGE UNIT,

659
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
AND SHE ENDS UP DEAD.

660
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
WHAT IF IT'S A "NO HONOR
AMONG THIEVES" THING?

661
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
YOU SAID IT WAS A 2-MAN JOB.

662
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
WHAT IF
WENDELL'S PARTNER DECIDED

663
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
THAT HE WANTED THE BRACELET
FOR HIMSELF,

664
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
ONLY HE KILLED WENDELL

665
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
BEFORE HE FIGURED OUT
WHERE HE'D STASHED IT?

666
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
SO HE FOLLOWS WENDY, SHE LEADS
HIM TO THE STORAGE UNIT,

667
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
AND THEN HE KILLS HER.

668
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
FIND THE PARTNER,
FIND THE KILLER.

669
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
WELL, MAYBE WE ALREADY
FOUND HIM.

670
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

671
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
CASTLE, DO YOU REMEMBER
AT THE AUCTION,

672
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
ALL OF THE BIDDERS
DROPPED OUT AFTER $1,500?

673
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
EXCEPT ONE.

674
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
HE KNEW WHAT WAS INSIDE.

675
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
WHY ELSE WOULD HE BID
SO HIGH?

676
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
(knock on door)

677
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
(Beckett)
FELIX GOZARIAN, NYPD.

678
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
OPEN UP.

679
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
JUST A SECOND!

680
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
(objects clatter)

681
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
HE'S MAKING A RUN FOR IT.

682
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
YEAH. GO. NYPD!

683
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
NYPD!

684
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
(clattering)

685
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
(grunts)

686
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
DON'T MOVE.

687
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
DROP IT.

688

689
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THIEVES
TRYING TO STEAL MY STUFF.

690
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT
WAS IN THE STORAGE UNIT. IT'S--

691
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
YET,
UNLIKE ANYONE ELSE THERE,

692
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
YOU BID US THROUGH THE ROOF.

693
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
LADY, THAT'S STRATEGY.
I-I BID ON A LOT OF THINGS.

694
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
THAT'S HOW I MAKE MY MONEY.

695
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
SO YOU ACTUALLY...
SELL THIS STUFF?

696
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
NOT YET.

697
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'M STILL ORGANIZING,
CATALOGING.

698
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
THERE'S A METHOD
TO ALL OF THIS--

699
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
YOU KNOW, WHAT I COLLECT,
WHAT I BID ON.

700
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GOT
INSIDE INFORMATION.

701
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
YOU KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT WAS IN THAT UNIT.

702
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
NO, I DIDN'T.

703
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING,

704
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
WHEN I SIGNED UP
FOR THE AUCTION,

705
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
THERE WAS A GUY.

706
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
YEAH, OFFERED ME $500
TO BE HIS PROXY,

707
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
GET UNIT 317.

708
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
VERY SPECIFIC. 317.

709
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?

710
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
(chuckles) I SAID NO.

711
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
$500? I'M NOT IN
FOR THE SHORT MONEY.

712
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
IT MADE ME CURIOUS.

713
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
317. WHY?

714
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
THAT WAS PROBABLY
WENDELL'S PARTNER.

715
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
MM-HMM.
AND WAS HE AT THE AUCTION?

716
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.
I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN.

717
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU TO SIT
WITH A SKETCH ARTIST.

718
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
SO FELIX ALIBIED OUT.

719
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
BUT...

720
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
WHO'S THAT?

721
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
WENDELL'S PARTNER.

722
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
RYAN AND ESPOSITO ARE TRYING
TO I.D. HIM NOW.

723
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
HOW ABOUT YOU?

724
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I HAVE RIPPED THROUGH

725
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
EVERYTHING IN THIS ROOM
BIG ENOUGH TO HIDE A BRACELET.

726
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
YOU YOOW WHAT I FOUND?

727
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
NOTHING?
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

728
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
SAVE FOR THESE
WICKED NUNCHAKUS,

729
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
WHICH IS HOW I BROKE
THE HOT DOG MAKER.

730
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000

PROSTHETIC EYE MANUFACTURING,
AND MY FAVORITE,

732
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
A "HISTORY
OF IRISH TRAVELERS."

733
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I DON'T GET IT.

734
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
ALL OF THE EVIDENCE,
WENDY'S MURDER--

735
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
EVERYTHING POINTS
TO THE FACT THAT

736
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
THAT BRACELET SHOULD BE
IN THERE.

737
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
WELL, IT'S NOT.

738
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I DID, HOWEVER,
MAKE SOME HEADWAY

739
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
ON MY
LITTLE STICK MAN THEORY.

740
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
REALLY?

741
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
YES. WHILST YOU WERE STILL
AN OFFICER,

742
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
YOU RISKED YOUR LIFE
RUNNING INTO TRAFFIC

743
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
TO SAVE AN OLD GYPSY WOMAN.

744
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
A GYPSY WOMAN?

745
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
AN OLD GYPSY WOMAN.

SHE SAID,
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP IT.

749
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
NO HARM WILL EVER BEFALL YOU.

750
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
NO HARM WILL EVER BEFALL ME?

751
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
YOU LOOK ALL RIGHT TO ME.

752
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
(Gates) SO, MR. CASTLE,

753
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I DECIDED TO GIVE

755
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
IT'S REALLY A GOOD BOOK.

756
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
YOU LIKED IT?

757
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I LOVED IT.

758
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I, UH, DO YOU MIND?

759
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
NO.

760
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I-I ORDERED THE REST
OF THE NIKKI HEAT SERIES.

761
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000

SHE LOVES ME NOW,

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000

MONSTROSITY TO THANK FOR IT.

768
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
HEY, GUYS.
YOU NEED TO SEE THIS.

769
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
SO ROBBERY INTERVIEWED A GUY
NAMED MARCO VINSTROLLI.

770
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000

777
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000

THAT HE RENTED MARCO A UNIT

778
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000

THE DAY BEFORE THE AUCTION.

779
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
SO I-I REVIEWED
THEIR SURVEILLANCE TAPES.

THE AUCTION.

HE BROKE INTO MY STORAGE UNIT.

783
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000

00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
SAID "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED,"
WE WENT SEPARATE WAYS.

862
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
EXCEPT YOU STILL WANTED
THE BRACELET.

863
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
SO YOU WENT AFTER HIM
AND YOU KILLED HIM.

864
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT
HE TOOK THAT DAMN BRACELET

865
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
UNTIL I READ ABOUT IT
IN THE PAPERS.

866
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
AND BY THAT TIME,

867
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
HE WAS ALREADY DEAD.

868
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
SO I BROKE INTO WENDELL'S,

869
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
BUT ALL I FOUND WAS A KEY,
MARKED "STORAGE UNIT."

870
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE THAT STORAGE UNIT WAS.

871
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
SO I KEPT A CLOSE EYE
ON UPCOMING AUCTIONS

872
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
UNTIL I FOUND ONE
WITH JOHAN'S NAME.

873
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
AS SOON AS I SAW
THE SAFE INSIDE, I KNEW...

874
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
THAT'S WHERE HE HAD STASHED
THAT DIAMOND BRACELET.

875
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
(hisses)

876
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
(clanks)

877
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
OH, I LOVE THIS PART--

878
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
THE KICK OF ADRENALINE,

879
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
THE QUICKENING OF THE HEART,

880
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
THOSE LAST FEW DROPS
OF ANTICIPATION.

881
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
(squeaks)

882
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
IT'S EMPTY.

883
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
(squeak)
SO WHERE IS THE BRACELET?

884
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
WHEREVER IT IS,
IT'S LAUGHING AT ME.

885
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
MAYBE MARCO WAS WRONG,

886
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
AND WENDELL SOLD IT
BEFORE HE WAS KILLED.

887
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
WELL, THEN WHERE'S
THE MONEY FROM THE SALE?

888
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
NO MONEY MEANS
THERE SHOULD BE A BRACELET.

889
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
NO BRACELET MEANS
THERE SHOULD BE MONEY.

890
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I THINK THE QUESTION WE SHOULD
BE ASKING IS, HOW DID WENDELL

891
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
EVEN PULL OFF A HEIST
LIKE THIS TO BEGIN WITH?

892
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
ANGELICA SAID

893
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
THAT THE THIEF CRACKED
THE WALL SAFE.

894
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO CRACK A WALL SAFE?

895
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
ESPECIALLY SINCE
WENDELL DIDN'T EVEN HAVE

896
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
ANY OF THE PROPER EQUIPMENT
IN HIS STORAGE UNIT. IT JUST--

897
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE?

898
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
THANK YOU.

899
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
UNLESS ANGELICA
WASN'T TELLING US THE TRUTH.

900
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
LISTEN TO THIS--

901
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
ANGELICA WAS SCHEDULED FOR
A BANKRUPTCY HEARING A WEEK AGO,

902
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
BUT IT WAS CANCELED BECAUSE
SHE MADE A $2-MILLION PAYMENT

903
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
TO HERREDITORS.

904
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
THAT'S RIGHT AFTER
THE INSURANCE COMPANY

905
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
PAID HER CLAIM
ON THE BRACELET.

906
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
WHAT IF THIS WHOLE THING

907
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
WAS A PLOY
TO COMMIT INSURANCE FRAUD?

908
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
"MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.""

909
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
THAT'S WHAT WENDELL SAID
AFTER THE BREAK-IN.

910
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
"MISSION ACCOMPLISHED."

911
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
RIGHT. HE DIDN'T SAY
HE ACTUALLY STOLE ANYTHING.

912
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
THE MISSION WAS TO MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE A ROBBERY.

913
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
AND THE BEST WAY
TO MAKE IT LOOK REAL,

914
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
TO FOOL THE POLICE
AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY...

915
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
IS TO ACTUALLY BREAK IN
YET STEAL NOTHING.

916
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
ANGELICA SET
THIS WHOLE THING UP.

917
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
AND THE ONLY OTHER PERSON
THAT KNEW WAS WENDELL.

918
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
SHE COULDN'T AFFORD
TO LET HIM OR HIS SISTER

919
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
EXPOSE HER SECRET.

920
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I CALL THAT MOTIVE
FOR MURDER

921
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000

FOR A SEARCH WARRANT.

THEY JUST BARGED IN.

TO SEARCH MY RESIDENCE.

931

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

SELL IT

AND SOLVE

INSTEAD OF HIRING WENDELL
TO STAGE A ROBBERY?

968
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I DIDN'T HIRE WENDELL.

969
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE WAS
INVOLVED IN ALL OF THIS

970

UNTIL YOU TOLD ME.

971
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
SO THE FACT THAT HE BROKE IN
THE SAME NIGHT THAT YOU CALLED

972
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
AND REPORTED THIS STOLEN,

973
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000

00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
LOOK, WHEN I CAME HOME

AND SAW THAT MY APARTMENT
HAD BEEN BURGLARIZED,

976
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I WAS--I WAS PANICKED,
SHOCKED.

UNTIL I SAW THAT
NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN.

978
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
SO I THOUGHT THAT IF I

979
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
SIMPLY PRETENDED THAT
MY BRACELET HAD BEEN STOLEN,

980
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000

DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING,

WAS SOSO DESPERA TO GET?

TO DO WITH HER MURDER,

(Martha) OH, ALEXIS.

1032
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
MY DARLING, FAREWELL.

1033
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
GOD KNOWS
WHEN WE SHALL MEET AGAIN.

1034
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
THAT'S SHAKESPEARE, YOU KNOW?

1035
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I KNOW.

1036
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
ALL RIGHT, NO FAREWELLS,
NO GOOD-BYES.

1037
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
JUST SEE YA LATER, KIDDO.

1038
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
SEE YOU LATER, GRAM.

1039
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I'LL BE IN THE HALL,
DARLING.

1040
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
ALL RIGHT.

1041
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
SO...

1042
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
THIS IS YOUR NEW HOME, HUH?

1043
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
HEY, LOOK, I GET IT.

1044
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I DO.

1045
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
BUT WHATEVER HAPPENS
BETWEEN BECKETT AND ME,

1046
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I WANT YOU TO KNOW--I MEAN,
WE COULD BREAK UP TOMORROW,

1047
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
WE COULD SPEND THE REST
OF OUR LIVES TOGETHER--

1048
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
BUT SHE WILL NEVER
TAKE YOUR PLACE IN MY HEART.

1049
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
WHY WOULD I BE WORRIED

1050
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
ABOUT DETECTIVE BECKETT
REPLACING ME?

1051
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
UH, WELL...

1052
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
YOU WERE ACT--I THOUGHT--

1053
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SMART

1054
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
AND SO CLUELESS
AT THE SAME TIME?

1055
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
PRACTICE.

1056
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
THIS IS
NO MORE ABOUT BECKETT

1057
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
THAN IT'S ABOUT THE FACT
MY MOTHER ISN'T HERE.

1058
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
SORRY, HONEY, BUT YOUR MOM...
NO.

1059
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
SHE'S IN--
NO, IT'S FINE.

1060
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN FINE,

1061
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT,

1062
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I'D WAKE UP,
AND YOU'D BE THERE,

1063
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
AND I'D KNOW
THAT EVERYTHING'S FINE.

1064
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
OH, AND WHEN
YOU WAKE UP HERE...

1065
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
THEN I'M HERE.

1066
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
AND YOU'RE THERE.

1067
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
EVEN THOUGH THERE
IS ONLY 5 MILES AWAY...

1068
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
(inhales and exhales)

1069
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
IT'S NOT HERE.

1070
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
WELL, EVERYTHING IS
GOING TO BE FINE.

1071
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
AND YOU ARE GONNA BE FINE.

1072
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
AND THOUGH I AM THERE,

1073
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
IF YOU NEED ME HERE,

1074
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
HERE IS WHERE I'LL BE.

1075
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
HEY, DAD.

1076
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I-I KNOW IT'S BEEN
A WHILE, BUT, UM...

1077
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
COULD YOU DO IT...

1078
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
ONE LAST TIME?

1079
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
NO MONSTERS.

1080
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
YOU SURE?

1081
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
YEAH, AND IF THERE ARE,
I'LL COME RUNNING.

1082
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
(sighs)

1083
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
(sniffles)

1084
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
DARLING, ARE YOU CRYING?

1085
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
(voice breaking)
NO, IT'S ALLERGIES.

1086
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
THE POLLEN COUNT IS HIGH.

1087
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
THE POLLEN COUNT'S GOTTEN
TO ME, TOO. (crying)

1088
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
RIGHT?

1089
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I KNOW. (continues crying)

1090
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
OHH.

1091
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
(people speaking indistinctly)

1092
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
MM.

1093
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
YOU CAN GET HOME
BY YOURSELF, RIGHT?

1094
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
WELL, I--
THANKS. LOVE YOU, MOTHER.

1095
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
(elevator bell dings)

1096

1097
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I KNOW WHERE IT IS.

1098
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
WHERE WHAT IS?

1099
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,
ONLY WHERE IT IS.

1100
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
WHATEVER WENDELL STOLE
WAS ONLY OF VALUE TO HIM

1101
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
AND HIS TWIN SISTER.

1102
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
SO HE WOULD HIDE IT
IN THE ONE PLACE

1103
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
ONLY SHE WOULD LOOK.

1104
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
WENDY, WENDELL, TWINS--

1105

AS IN GEMINI COLLECTIBLES.

1106
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
THIS IS IT.

1107
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000

1108
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
IT'S EMPTY.
(footsteps approaching)

1109
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
OH, THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

1110
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
(gasps) WHAT--

1111
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
OH, SIR, JUST BREATHE.

1112
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
WHAT THE HELL
HAVE YOU DONE?

1113
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I THOUGHT--

1114
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Y-YOU THOUGHT WHAT,
MR. CASTLE?

1115
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I JUST THOUGHT THAT WENDELL
WOULD'VE HIDDEN WHAT HE STOLE

1116
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
INSIDE THE GEMINI--

1117
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
IT WASN'T WENDELL'S.
IT WAS MINE!

1118
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I BROUGHT IT IN
FROM HOME THIS MORNING!

1119
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S MY BAD.

1120
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
WAIT. THAT MEANS...

1121
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
AH. HERE IT IS.

1122
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000

1123
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000

OKAY, SO THE PHOTOS
FROM THIS U.S.B. DRIVE

1152
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
ARE FROM A CRIME SCENE.

1153

IT WAS A HIT-AND-RUN.

HAVE TO DO WITH A GLASS EYE?

KILLED IN A CAR CRASH
TEN YEARS AGO?

1159
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
YEAH, THEY WERE REAR-ENDED,

1160
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
AND THEIR CAR WENT DOWN

AND CALLED FOR HELP,
THEY MIGHT HAVE LIVED.

1164

HEY, GUYS.
LOOK AT THIS PHOTO.

1165
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
IT'S FROM THE CRIME SCENE,
AND IT'S OF A BROKEN GLASS EYE.

1166
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
WHAT?

1167
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000

1171
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
WENDELL'S OBSESSION--

1172
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
WHY HE MOVED
FROM PLACE TO PLACE,

1173
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
WHY HE CAME TO NEW YORK,
WHY HE USED A FAKE NAME

1174
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
AND A HAD A BOOK
ON PROSTHETIC EYES.

1175
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
HE WAS--
HE WAS ON A MISSION.

1176
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
YEAH, BUT ON A MISSION
TO DO WHAT?

1177
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
WELL, TO FIND
THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE

1178
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
FOR HIS PARENTS' DEATH.

1179
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
IN ORDER TO BE SURE,

1180
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
WENDELL HAD TO STEAL
THE SUSPECT'S GLASS EYE.

1181
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
THAT'S WHAT THE HEIST
WAS ABOUT.

1182
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
AND LIKE FINGERPRINTS, HE USED
THAT PHOTO TO COMPARE THE EYES.

1183
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
A LA RICHARD KIMBLE,

1184
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
BUT INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR
A ONE-ARMED MAN...

1185
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
HE WAS LOOKING
FOR A ONE-EYED MAN.

1186
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
OR IN OUR CASE,
A ONE-EYED WOMAN.

1187
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I'M NOT SAYING A WORD
WITHOUT MY LAWYER.

1188
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO,
BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO LISTEN.

1189
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
WE KNOW WHAT WENDELL STOLE.

1190
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
THAT'S IT.
I'M CALLING MY ATTORNEY.

1191
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000

1192
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000

WAITING PATIENTLY
FOR THE DAY

1196
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I COULD UNEQUIVOCALLY EXCLAIM,

1197
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
THE BUTLER DID IT.

1198
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
WHAT?

1199
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
MUST HAVE BEEN A SHOCK--

1200
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
ALL THESE YEARS LATER,

1201
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
AFTER YOU PUT ALL THAT
BEHIND YOU,

1202
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000

WALK INTO YOUR LIFE

1203

AND STIR IT ALL
BACK UP AGAIN.

1204
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
(Angelica) KIRBY.

1205
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?

1206
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
YOUR LIVE-IN BUTLER
CAUSED A CAR ACCIDENT

1207
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
AND THEN FLED THE SCENE.

1208
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
BECAUSE HE DID,
TWO PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES.

1209
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
AND THOSE PEOPLE
WERE WENDELL'S PARENTS.

1210
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
(Kirby) THAT IS...

1211
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.

1212
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
YOU CAN'T PROVE ANY OF IT.

1213
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
YOUR D.N.A. WAS ON
THE PROSTHETIC EYE

1214
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
THAT WENDELL STOLE.

1215
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
AND IT'S A MATCH TO THE D.N.A.

1216
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
FOUND ON THE SHELL CASING
IN WENDY'S HOTEL ROOM.

1217
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
(Castle) IT'S ALL OVER.

1218
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I WORKED...

1219
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
SO HARD TO PUT THAT NIGHT--

1220
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
THAT HORRIBLE NIGHT--
BEHIND ME.

1221
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
AND THEN THE BREAK-IN.

1222
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
OF ALL THE THINGS
TO STEAL,

1223
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
MY SPARE EYE
FROM OFF MY BUREAU.

1224
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
THAT'S WHEN I PUT IT
ALL TOGETHER--

1225
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
WHO THE NEW CHAUFFER
TRULY WAS

1226
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
AND WHAT HE WAS TRYING
TO PROVE.

1227
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
BUT YOU--
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND...

1228
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I COULDN'T BRING
THEIR PARENTS BACK.

1229
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I-I COULDN'T.

1230
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
WHY SHOULD I SUFFER?

1231
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
KIRBY SMITH,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

1232
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
FOR THE MURDERS OF WENDELL

1233
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
AND WENDY DUPREE.

1234
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
(handcuffs click)
AND I AM SURE THAT
THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA

1235
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
WILL BE ADDING TWO COUNTS

1236
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
OF VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER
TO THAT.

1237
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
(Beckett)
KIRBY MADE A FULL CONFESSION.

1238
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
HE READ AN ARTICLE
ABOUT A RECENT MUGGING

1239
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
IN THE SUBWAY STATION,

1240
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
AND DECIDED
TO KILL WENDELL THERE

1241
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT
THE CAMERAS WOULDN'T BE WORKING.

1242
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
(Castle) BUT THE EVIDENCE
THAT WENDELL STOLE

1243
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
WAS STILL OUT THERE,
SO WAS HIS SISTER WENDY.

1244
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
WHEN SHE STARTED
POKING AROUND STORAGE SPACES,

1245
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
KIRBY TRACKED HER
TO THE HOTEL AND SHOT HER.

1246
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
WORTHLESS BASTARD.

1247
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I'M SORRY.

1248
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
HE TOOK OUT
THEIR WHOLE FAMILY.

1249
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
GOOD JOB, DETECTIVE.

1250
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
THANK YOU.

1251
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
AND... SHE HATES ME AGAIN.

1252
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
YEAH, WELL, THOSE GEMINI DOLLS
OBVIOUSLY MEANT A LOT TO HER.

1253
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
YEAH, I WONDER WHAT
THAT STORY IS.

1254
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I WONDER
WHAT THOSE STORIES ARE.

1255
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH
ALL OF THAT STUFF, CASTLE?

1256
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
WELL, I'LL GIVE THE CLIMBING
EQUIPMENT TO JAVIER,

1257
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
AND THEN, UH,

1258
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
DONATE THE REST, I GUESS.

1259
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
IT SERVED ITS PURPOSE.
BROUGHT JUSTICE TO HIS FAMILY.

1260
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
BUT IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU
THAT EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING

1261
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
HAS A STORY,

1262
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
INCLUDING YOUR LITTLE
STICK MAN THERE.

1263
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
SO...

1264
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
YOU WANT TO TAKE
ANOTHER SHOT?

1265
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
ACTUALLY, NO.

1266
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID.

1267
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

1268
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
JUST BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN...

1269
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
SHAKING HANDS

1270
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
A LOT...

1271
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
DOESN'T MEAN THAT
I HAVE THE RIGHT TO PRY.

1272
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
SO...
WHEN YOU ARE READY,

1273
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,000
YOU'LL TELL ME.

1274
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
CONEY ISLAND.

1275
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
WE, UH, WE HAD A RECEPTION
AT OUR PLACE

1276
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
AFTER MY MOM'S FUNERAL,

1277
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
AND... IT WAS MISERABLE.

1278
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I WAS MISERABLE,
AND MY DAD...

1279
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
TOOK MY HAND
AND HE SAID, UH,

1280
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
"LET'S GET THE HELL
OUTTA HERE, KATIE."

1281
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
AND WE TOOK THE "Q" TRAIN,

1282
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
AND WE WENT
UP TO CONEY ISLAND.

1283
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
AND WE WALKED
UP AND DOWN THAT BEACH,

1284
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
JUST ENJOYING OURSELVES.

1285
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
WE WERE STILL
IN OUR FUNERAL CLOTHES.

1286
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
AND THE BEST PART WAS THAT
WE MADE THIS LITTLE GUY

1287
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,000
OUT OF THE TWIGS AND TWINE
THAT WASHED UP ON THE SHORE.

1288
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
DOES THAT MAKE THAT DAY

1289
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
A BAD MEMORY
OR A GOOD ONE?

1290
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
BOTH.

1291
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
HE'S A REMINDER...

1292
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
THAT EVEN ON THE WORST DAYS,

1293
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
FOR JOY.

1294
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
NICE.

1295
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
SO WE'LL TALK TONIGHT?

1296
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I CAN'T WAIT.

1297
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
MY LITTLE GIRL.

1298
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
ALEXIS' MOVING OUT
GOT ME TO THINKING.

1299
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
AND AFTER MANY HOURS
OF SOUL SEARCHING,

1300
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I HAVE MADE A DECISION.

1301
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
HAVE YOU NOW?
YES.

1302
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I HAVE DECIDED, OUT OF
THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART,

1303
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
THAT I WILL CONTINUE
TO LIVE HERE--

1304
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
RENT-FREE.

1305
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
PLEASE DON'T INTERRUPT.

1306
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE HERE

1307
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
SO THAT YOU, RICHARD...

1308
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
WILL NEVER, EVER BE ALONE.

1309
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME,
MOTHER?

1310
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
(voice breaks)
IT'S A PARENT'S SACRIFICE.

1311
