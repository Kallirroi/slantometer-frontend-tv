CATEGORY OF WEAPON WHICH THE

156
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
IT'S A KILLER WEAPON.

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
YOU CAN FIRE IT VERY QUICKLY.

158
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
IT HAS VERY LITTLE RECOIL, VERY

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
LITTLE KICK, AND IT'S VERY HIGH

160
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
VELOCITY.

161
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000

STREETS OF OUR CITY.

163
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
AND IT DOESN'T BELONG IN A PLACE

164
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
WHERE A 20-YEAR-OLD LIKE THIS

165
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
PARTICULAR 20-YEAR-OLD COULD GET

166
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
AHOLD OF IT AND GO IN AND DO
WHAT HE DID.

167
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
AND THIS MAKES ME VERY ANGRY.

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
SAY I HAVE MY SECOND AMENDMENT

170
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
RIGHTS.

171
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'M ENTITLED TO BEAR ARMS.

172
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO TAKE

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
AWAY THAT RIGHT BY REMOVING

174
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
THESE KIND OF WEAPONS FROM THE

175
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
STREETS AND FROM THE STORES.

176
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000

177
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
RIGHT TO BEAR EVERY TYPE OF

178
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
WEAPON THAT YOU KNOW OF.

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
THESE ARE A CERTAIN CLASS OF

180
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
WEAPONS.

181
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
THEY ARE DESIGNED TO KILL LARGE

182
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN CLOSE

183
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
COMBAT.

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I DON'T BELIEVE THE SECOND

185
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
AMENDMENT COVERS THEM.

186
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
THE SECOND AMENDMENT WAS WRITTEN

187
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
A LONG TIME BEFORE THESE -- THIS

188
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
CLASS OF WEAPONS WAS FOUNDED,

189
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
MERCHANDISED, AND SPREAD ALL
OVER OUR COUNTRY.

190
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
WHERE THEY FALL INTO THE HANDS

191
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
OF JUVENILES, GRIEVANCE KILLERS,

192
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
PEOPLE WHO GO INTO OUR MALLS,

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
OUR THEATERS, OUR STORES, OUR

194
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
BUSINESSES, AND NOW OUR SCHOOLS
AND JUST KILL PEOPLE FOR NO GOOD

195
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
REASON.

196
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
IT'S GOT TO STOP.

197
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
>> TELL ME ABOUT THE REACTION

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
YOU'VE HAD ALREADY FROM OTHER

199
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
POLITICIANS.

200
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET ANY GUN

201
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
SUPPORTING POLITICIAN ON THE

202
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
SHOW.
AND LIKE MOST SHOWS ON AMERICAN

203
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
TELEVISION RIGHT NOW, THEY DON'T

204
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
WANT TO COME ON.

205
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THEY'RE HIDING AWAY, AS ARE

206
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
MEMBERS OF THE NRA AND ALL THE

207
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
USUAL SUSPECTS WHEN THESE

208
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN.
ARE YOU DETECTING, SENATOR, THAT

209
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
THERE IS CHANGE IN MOOD?

210
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
ARE YOU HOPING THIS IS A TIPPING

211
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
POINT?

212
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
>> YES, I HOPE SO, PIERS.

213
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I HAD TO DO A BRIEF SEGMENT ON

214
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
"MEET THE PRESS" YESTERDAY

215
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
MORNING.
AND AFTERWARDS, I PROBABLY GOT

216
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
20 PHONE CALLS AT HOME HERE IN

217
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
WASHINGTON.
VERY UNUSUAL, PEOPLE FROM

218
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
WASHINGTON AND CALIFORNIA

219
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
CALLING AND SAYING WE WANT TO

220
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
HELP WITH THIS.

221
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
IT'S GOT TO STOP.

222
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I EVEN HAD ONE MAN WHO WAS A

223
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
MEMBER OF THE NRA WHO SAID I

224
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
HAVE AN AR-15, AND I'M GOING TO

225
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
GET RID OF IT.

226
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'M A HUNTER, AND I WANT YOU TO

227
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE ASSAULT

228
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
WEAPONS.
SO I'M GOING TO DO MY LEVEL BEST

229
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
TO TRY.

230
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I DID IT ONCE BEFORE IN 1993.

231
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
WE SAT DOWN AND WE WROTE A BILL,

232
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
AND THAT BILL PASSED THE SENATE.

233
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
CHUCK SCHUMER INTRODUCED IT IN

234
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
THE HOUSE.
IT PASSED.

235
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
IT WAS NOT AMENDED.

236
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
IT WAS PASSED.

237
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
AND IT WENT TO THE PRESIDENT.

238
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
PRESIDENT CLINTON SIGNED IT, AND

239
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
IT WAS THE LAW FOR TEN YEARS.

240
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
AND OVER TIME, IT BEGAN TO WIND

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
DOWN THE SUPPLY OF THESE

242
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
WEAPONS.
AND PARTICULARLY THE CLIPS,

243
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
DRUMS, OR STRIPS OF OVER 100

244
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
BULLETS.

245
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THE

246
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
PERSON THAT WENT INTO THAT

247
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
HEATER IN AURORA HAD A DRUM WITH

248
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
100 BULLETS IN HIS ASSAULT

249
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
WEAPON.

250
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
FORTUNATELY, THAT DRUM JAMMED OR

251
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
ELSE HE WOULD HAVE HAD 100 CLEAR

252
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
SHOTS AT PEOPLE SITTING IN SEATS

253
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
IN A MOVIE THEATER.

254
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
NOW HERE YOU PROBABLY HAD THIS

255
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
MAN FIRE MORE THAN 100 BULLETS.

256
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I MEAN, WE'VE JUST HEARD WHERE

257
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
NO CHILD HAD LESS THAN THREE

258
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
BULLETS IN THEM.

259
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
OF WHAT IS A KILLER WEAPON.

260
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
THAT SHOULDN'T BE ON THE STREETS

261
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
OF OUR CITY.

262
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
AND NOW THESE CHILDREN, THIS IS

263
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
THE STRAW THAT BREAKS THE

264
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
CAMEL'S BACK.

265
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO RESPOND.

266
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

267
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
RIGHTS OF THE MANY TO REMAIN

268
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
SAFE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY

269
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
RIGHT YOU MAY THINK YOU HAVE TO

270
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
HAVE A MILITARY-STYLE ASSAULT

271
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
WEAPON.

272
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
>> SENATOR FEINSTEIN, I APPLAUD

273
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I WISH YOU

274
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
EVERY SUCCESS.

275
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, PIERS, I APPRECIATE

276
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
IT.
>>> MY NEXT GUEST IS A GUN

277
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
RIGHTS ADVOCATE.
HE SAYS THE BUSHMASTER

278
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE, THE TYPE OF

279
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
RIFLE ADAM LANZA USED TO KILL 20

280
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
CHILDREN AND SIX MORE ADULTS

281
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
SAYS, QUOTE IS A BLAST TO SHOOT

282
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
WITH.

283
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE

284
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
VIRGINIA CITIZENS DEFENSE

285
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
LEAGUE.
I WANT TO READ WHAT YOU SAID ON

286
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
SUNDAY TO THE "WASHINGTON POST."

287
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
YOU SAID I COULD ASK YOU WHEN

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
ASKED ABOUT THE USE OF THESE

289
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
TYPE OF WEAPONS WHY SHOULD

290
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
ANYONE WANT A FERRARI?

291
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
BUSHMASTERS ARE ABSOLUTELY A

292
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
BLAST TO SHOOT WITH.

293
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
THEY'RE FAST.
THEY'RE ACCURATE.

294
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
GUNS ARE FUN.

295
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
SOME OF THEM ARE MUCH MORE COOL

296
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THAN OTHERS.

297
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
IT'S JUST LIKE WE HAVE

298
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
TELEVISION SETS THAT LOOK COOL

299
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
AND OTHERS ARE MUCH MORE BOXY.

300
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
ARE YOU PROUD OF WHAT YOU SAID?

301
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
>> IT'S JUST A FACT.

302
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIREARMS.

303
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
PEOPLE -- I'M AN INSTRUCTOR.

304
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
AND WHEN I TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO

305
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
SHOOT, YOU SHOULD SEE THEIR FACE

306
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
LIGHT UP THE FIRST TIME THEY

307
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
SHOOT A FIREARM.
IT'S LIKE WHAT THEY EXPECTED.

308
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
IT IS A LOT OF FUN.

309
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
IT'S THE NATURE OF GUNS.

310
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
IT'S BEEN A PART OF OUR COUNTRY

311
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
FOR 250 YEARS.

312
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
>> DO YOU THINK THIS IS A TIME

313
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
TO THINK ABOUT GUNS BEING FUN

314
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
WHEN 20 CHILDREN AGED 5 YEARS

315
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
OLD ARE BEING BLOWN TO PIECES BY

316
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
A WEAPON THAT IS FREELY
AVAILABLE IN THIS COUNTRY?

317
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
>> WELL, YOU NEED TO ASK THE

318
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
REPORTER, BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONE

319
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
THAT APPROACHED ME WITH THE

320
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
PARTICULAR QUESTIONS.

321
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I SIMPLY ANSWERED THEM.

322
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING TO

323
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
UNDERSTAND.
HE WAS NOT A GUN PERSON, DIDN'T

324
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT GUNS.

325
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
SO I WAS TRYING TO BE HELPFUL.

326
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
>> WHY DON'T YOU TRY AND BE

327
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
HELPFUL AND EDUCATE ME.

328
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
WHY DOES ANYBODY IN AMERICA WHO

329
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
IS NOT IN THE MILITARY OR THE

330
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
POLICE FORCE NEED A

331
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPON THAT CAN

332
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
UNLEASH HUNDREDS OF SHOTS IN A

333
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
MATTER OF A FEW MINUTES AND

334
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
SLAUGHTER INNOCENT AMERICANS?

335
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
>> WE DO UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT A

336
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
MACHINE GUN.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR.

337
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
>> I DIDN'T --

338
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
>> THIS ISN'T ABOUT MACHINE

339
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
GIERNGS I UNDERSTAND VERY

340
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
CAREFULLY.

341
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
MY BROTHER IS A BRITISH COLONEL.

342
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I KNOW WHAT WEAPONS ARE.

343
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
IT'S A SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE.

344
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
IT'S THE SAME RIFLE THAT WAS

345
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
USED IN AURORA.

346
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
AND I HAVE MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE

347
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
AFFECTED BY THAT TONIGHT WITH ME

348
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
TONIGHT LIVE AFTER THIS.

349
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
AND ALSO IN THE OREGON SHOPPING

350
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
MALL SHOOTING.

351
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THIS MACHINE

352
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
CAN DO.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT DID TO

353
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
THESE CHILDREN.
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHY YOU

354
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS

355
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
WEAPON AND THE TYPE OF WEAPONS

356
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
LIKE IT SHOULD BE FREELY

357
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
AVAILABLE TO AMERICANS WHEN THEY

358
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
ARE BEING USED FOR A SERIES, AND

359
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
IT ACCEPT DEEM MICK NOW.

360
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
SIX OF THE WORST MASS SHOOTINGS

361
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
IN AMERICAN SHOOTINGS HAVE

362
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
OCCURRED SINCE 2007.

363
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
WHY YOU PERSIST IN WANTING THIS

364
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
TO BE FREELY AVAILABLE TO

365
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
AMERICANS.

366
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
>> WELL, AUTOMOBILES KILL MORE

367
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS THAN GUNS

368
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
DO, BUT WE DON'T SAY WE

369
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM BECAUSE SOME

370
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
MANIAC THAT IS DRUNK ENDS UP

371
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
DRIVING A CAR INTO A FAMILY AND

372
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
KILLING THEM.

373
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
THIS WAS A MISUSE OF SOMETHING

374
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
BY CLEARLY SOMEBODY THAT WAS

375
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
MENTALLY UNSTABLE.
WHY SHOULD THEN THE REST OF THE

376
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
COUNTRY WITH THE HUNDREDS OF

377
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
MILLIONS OF GUNOWNERS IN AMERICA

378
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
THAT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG

379
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
WITH THEIR GUNS, WHY ARE WE

380
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
TURNING THEM, AS IF THIS WAS

381
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
THEIR FAULT?

382
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
THIS IS NOT THEIR FAULT.

383
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
THIS WAS A MANIAC IN A STATE

384
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
THAT HAD A LOT OF GUN CONTROL IN

385
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
A GUN-FREE ZONE THAT IGNORED

386
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
EVERY LAW THERE WAS AND MURDERED
ALL THOSE POOR LITTLE CHILDREN.

387
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
>> DO YOU KNOW ANY MORE FORM OF

388
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
GUN CONTROL IN THIS COUNTRY?

389
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
YOU'RE QUITE HAPPY WITH WHERE

390
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
THINGS ARE?
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY.

391
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
CRIME HAS BEEN FALLING IN

392
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
AMERICA.

393
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
IN FACT, SINCE THE ASSAULT

394
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
WEAPON BAN THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE

395
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
YEARS AGO BY SENATOR FEINSTEIN,

396
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
EVEN WHEN AFTER THAT EXPIRED,

397
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
OUR CRIME RATES CONTINUED TO GO

398
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
DOWN IN AMERICA.

399
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
THE VIOLENT CRIME RATE IS DOWN.

400
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
THE ASSAULT WEAPON BAN DIDN'T

401
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
DO --
>> HOW MANY PEOPLE GET KILLED

402
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
WITH GUNS, GET MURDERED WITH

403
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
GUNS A YEAR IN YOUR COUNTRY?
DO YOU KNOW?

404
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
>> WELL, MOST OF IT IS EITHER

405
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
SUICIDES OR CRIMINAL ON CRIMINAL

406
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
SHOOTINGS.
>> THAT WASN'T WHAT I ASKED YOU.

407
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
WAIT A MINUTE.

408
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
>> SOMEWHERE 20,000 --
>> I DIDN'T ASK YOU ABOUT

409
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
SUICIDES.
I ASKED YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE

410
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
MURDERED WITH GUNS IN AMERICA ON

411
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
AVERAGE IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE

412
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
YEARS.
DO YOU KNOW THAT FIGURE?

413
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
>> I DON'T BECAUSE THE FBI

414
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
CLUMPS IT TOGETHER WITH

415
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
SUICIDES.
>> THEY DON'T, ACTUALLY.

416
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
IT'S VERY EASY TO FIND.

417
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
IT'S ABOUT 11,000 TO 12,000.

418
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY --

419
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
>> I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT NUMBER.

420
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
THAT MAKES SENSE.

421
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY ON

422
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
AVERAGE GET KILLED IN BRITAIN OR

423
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
GERMANY OR AUSTRALIA?
AND I PARTICULARLY MENTION

424
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
BRITAIN AND AUSTRALIA, BECAUSE

425
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
IN 1996 WE HAD A VERY SIMILAR

426
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
ATTACK IN DUNBLANE IN SCOTLAND

427
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
THAT KILLED 16 YOUNG CHILDREN.

428
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
WE INSTITUTED A HANDGUN BAN.

429
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
IN AUSTRALIA THEY WENT FURTHER.

430
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
THEY HAD A GOVERNOR INITIATIVE

431
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
TO BRING BACK GUNS.
THEY WOULD GIVE PEOPLE MONEY IN

432
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
RETURN FOR THE GUNS.
THEY BANNED ASSAULT WEAPONS OF

433
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
THE TYPE YOU'RE SEEING HERE

434
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
CAUSING THIS TRAGEDY.
AND GUESS WHAT?

435
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
THERE HAVE BEEN NO MORE

436
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
SHOOTINGS IN SCHOOLS IN BRITAIN,

437
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
IN DUNBLANE SINCE THAT BAN CAME

438
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
IN.
AND THERE HAS BEEN NO MASS

439
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
SHOOTING IN AUSTRALIA WHATSOEVER

440
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
SINCE 1996.

441
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
AND I SAY TO YOU --

442
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
>> THE CRIME RATES OF GUNS HAVE

443
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
DOUBLED.
>> I SAY TO YOU AGAIN, THIS

444
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
STATISTIC OF 11,000 TO 12,000

445
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
MURDERS FROM GUNS, IT IS WAY,

446
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
WAY AHEAD OF ANY OF THE

447
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
CIVILIZED COUNTRIES OF THIS

448
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
WORLD.
IT IS A DISGRACE TO AMERICA AND

449
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT IT'S

450
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
CONTINUED TO HAPPEN.

451
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
AND THE REASONS IT HAPPENS, AND

452
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I SAY THIS WITH RESPECT TO YOU,

453
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
IS YOUR FACETIOUS ATTITUDE

454
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
COMPARING IT TO CARS.

455
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
THE FACT THAT EVEN AFTER 20

456
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
CHILDREN ARE BLOWN TO PIECES,

457
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
YOU STILL SEE NO PROBLEM IN THIS

458
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
RIDICULOUS ASSAULT WEAPON BEING

459
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
FREELY AVAILABLE ON THE STREETS

460
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
OF YOUR COUNTRY, AND THAT MAY BE

461
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
A LOAD OF OTHER DERANGED YOUNG

462
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
MEN WHO WANT TO MAKE A NAME FOR

463
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
THEMSELVESES WHO CAN JUST GO AND

464
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
GET ONE AND FIND IT EASIER TO

465
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
BUY ONE THAT IT IS TO BUY A PET.

466
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
THIS IS SHAMEFUL TO AMERICA.

467
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
AND PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE ALLOWING

468
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
IT TO CONTINUE.

469
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT GUNS

470
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
BEING FUN ON ABOUT THIS BEING

471
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
THE FERRARI OF WEAPONS, I SAY TO

472
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
YOU THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO TALK

473
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
ABOUT GUNS BEING FUN.

474
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
>> WELL, TALK TO THE PRESS ABOUT

475
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
THAT.
YOU GUYS, YOU HAVE BEEN PUSHING

476
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
THAT ISSUE, ASKING THESE KINDS

477
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
OF QUESTIONS.

478
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
IF YOU THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE

479
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
YOU REALLY DO NEED TO TALK TO

480
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
SOME OF YOUR FELLOW PEOPLE IN

481
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
THE PRESS.

482
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
THEY'RE ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE
YOU'RE ASKING QUESTIONS.

483
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'M TRYING TO ANSWER THEM.

484
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
>> THE DAY AFTER 20 CHILDREN ARE

485
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
MURDERED TO COMPARE THESE GUNS

486
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
TO FERRARIS.

487
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
>> HE ASKED ME A SERIES OF

488
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
QUESTIONS.
MOST DIDN'T GO ON THERE.

489
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
>> YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS.

490
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
THEY DIDN'T PUT THE WORDS INTO

491
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
YOUR MOUTH.

492
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
>> NO.
>> AND I ASKED YOU TODAY IF YOU

493
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
WERE PROUD OF THEM, AND YOU

494
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
STOOD BY IT.
YOU SAID IT IS THE TRUTH.

495
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
>> IT IS THE TRUTH.

496
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
YOU WANT ME TO LIE?

497
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS SHOULDN'T
BE SILENCING --

498
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT THE TRUTH.

499
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
IT'S ABOUT THIS, SIR, WITH

500
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
REPRESENT.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SECOND

501
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
AMENDMENT.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BILL OF

502
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
RIGHTS THERE ARE ALREADY

503
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
EXTENSIVE GUN CONTROLS IN THIS
COUNTRY, EXTENSIVE.

504
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS ABOUT

505
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
REACTING TO AN APPALLING

506
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
TRAGEDY, THE LIKE OF WHICH

507
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
AMERICA HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

508
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
IN THE LAST FIVE MONTHS, THERE

509
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
HAS BEEN THE WORST EVER SINGLE

510
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
SHOOTING IN AURORA, 70 PEOPLE

511
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
SHOT.

512
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
THERE HAS BEEN THE WORST EVER

513
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING, 20 CHILDREN

514
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
AGED 5 YEARS OLD.

515
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
AND AMERICA --
>> THEY HAPPENED IN GUN-FREE

516
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
ZONES.
>> OH, DO STOP BEING SO

517
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
FACETIOUS.

518
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
>> THEY DO, I'M SERIOUS.

519
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
NO NO, THAT'S NOT BEING

520
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
FACETIOUS.
IT HAPPENED WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T

521
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
DEFEND THEMSELVES.

522
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
>> SO YOU BELIEVE THIS THEORY,

523
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
THAT IF EVERYONE IN THAT MOVIE

524
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
THEATER WAS ARMED, THEY WOULD

525
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
HAVE ALL STOOD UP --

526
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
>> NOT EVERYONE.

527
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
>> HOW MANY DO YOU WANT TO BE

528
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
ARMED IN THAT MOVIE THEATER?

529
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
>> I BELIEVE SOMEBODY FIRING AT

530
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
HIM WOULD HAVE SLOWED HIM DOWN

531
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
OR POSSIBLY STOPPED HIM, YES.

532
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
>> YOU'RE AWARE OF THE

533
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
SHOOTING --
>> NOT BEEN ABLE TO CARRY THEM

534
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
OUT.
>> YOU'RE AWARE OF THE SHOOTING

535
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
IN NEW YORK RECENTLY WHERE

536
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
POLICE FIRED, AND THESE ARE

537
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
EXPERT MARKSMEN, USED TO

538
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
HANDLING FIREARMS ACTUALLY SHOT

539
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
EIGHT PEOPLE.
YOU WERE AWARE OF THAT.

540
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
THEY WERE POLICE OFFICERS.

541
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
>> I WAS A DEPUTY SHERIFF.

542
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
SO I KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT THAN YOU

543
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
DO.

544
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
>> REALLY?

545
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
>> AND THE HIGHLY -- YES.

546
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000

SHE HAS LOST THREE OF HER

727
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
FRIENDS.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN UNBELIEVABLY

728
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
TRAUMATIC FOR HER.

729
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
>> WELL, SHE WASN'T CLOSE WITH

730
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE SO

731
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
DIFFERENT IN AGE.

732
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
BUT THEY ARE FROM HER DANCE

733
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
STUDIO.
BUT WE HAVE THREE DEATHS WITHIN

734
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

735
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
THE SHOOTER LIVED WITHIN MY

736
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.
WE LOST OUR FORMER BABY-SITTER,

737
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
LOST HER MOTHER.

738
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
SO IT'S ON MULTIPLE FRONTS.

739
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
>> HOW DO YOU THINK THE
COMMUNITY IS DOING THERE?

740
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
>> THEY'RE VERY STRONG.

741
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
THEY'RE COMING TOGETHER.

742
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
IT'S REALLY -- THESE LAST TWO

743
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
DAYS HAVE BEEN A HORROR.

744
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
PEOPLE ARE UP IN ARMS.

745
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
PEOPLE ARE MOTIVED TO DO

746
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
SOMETHING AND TO BE CALLED TO

747
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
ACTION.
PEOPLE WANT TO HELP.

748
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
>> AND AS PEOPLE ARE WATCHING

749
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
THIS AND WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY

750
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
CAN HELP, WHAT IS THE BEST WAY

751
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
FOR PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF NEWTOWN TO
CONTRIBUTE?

752
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
>> WELL, TO CONTRIBUTE I THINK

753
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
FOR OUR COUNTRY, BECAUSE IT'S

754
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
REALLY ABOUT OUR COUNTRY, IF

755
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
IT'S ONLY NEWTOWN THAT GOES

756
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
THROUGH THESE CHANGES AND TRIES

757
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
TO EFFECT THESE THINGS, THAT'S

758
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
ONE SMALL PART.

759
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
WE ALL HAVE TO -- EVERY

760
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
COMMUNITY IN THIS NATION NEEDS

761
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CAN

762
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
HAPPEN IF WE HAVE PROLIFERATION

763
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
OF GUNS AND EMOTIONAL

764
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
INSTABILITY IN YOUR COMMUNITY,

765
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
THIS CAN HAPPEN.
AND WE NEED ALL COMMUNITIES,

766
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
BASICALLY, TO RALLY THEIR LOCAL

767
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
AND STATE GOVERNMENT, FEDERAL

768
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
GOVERNMENT, AND GET OUR ELECTED

769
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
OFFICIALS TO HAVE THE MORAL

770
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
COURAGE TO SIT DOWN WITH EACH

771
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
OTHER AND HAVE COMMON SENSE

772
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
DISCUSSIONS AND LISTEN TO EACH

773
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
OTHER AND LISTEN TO THEIR POINTS

774
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
AND FIND SOME MIDDLE COMMON

775
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
GROUND.

776
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
>> LEE SHULL, THANK YOU VERY

777
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
MUCH FOR JOINING ME.

778
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I DO APPRECIATE IT.
>> THANK YOU.

779
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
>> NOW I WANT TO BRING IN MY

780
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
SPECIAL GUESTS HERE IN THE

781
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
STUDIO, LOVED ONES OF THE

782
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
VICTIMS OF THE AURORA, COLORADO,

783
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
SHOOTING, AND A SURVIVOR.

784
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
WELCOME TO YOU ALL.

785
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
EVEN WHEN I'VE TALKED TO YOU IN

786
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
OUR GREEN ROOM, A LOT OF

787
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
EMOTION, A LOT OF ANGER, A LOT

788
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
OF GREAT SADNESS.

789
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I CAN ONLY BEGIN TO IMAGINE HOW

790
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
YOU'VE ALL BEEN HEARING THAT SO

791
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
SOON AFTER WHAT HAPPENED IN

792
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
AURORA, ARGUABLY AN EVEN WORSE

793
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
TRAGEDY.

794
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
20 5-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN BLOWN TO

795
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
PIECE.

796
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
STEVE, LET ME START WITH THAT.
YOU WERE A VICTIM IN AURORA.

797
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
YOU WERE SHOT.

798
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
HOW YOU DOING PHYSICALLY, FIRST

799
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
OF ALL?
>> I'M SLOWLY RECOVERING.

800
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
SOME NERVE DAMAGE IN MY LEFT

801
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
ARM.
BUT ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, DOING

802
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
REALLY WELL.

803
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
>> IT'S NEARLY FIVE MONTHS TO

804
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
THE DAY SINCE THE MASSACRE IN
THAT MOVIE THEATER.

805
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
AND WE SEE THIS INCIDENT

806
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
HAPPENING IN NEWTOWN.

807
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
IT'S JUST BEYOND GROTESQUE.

808
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
WHAT WERE YOUR FEELINGS WHEN YOU

809
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
HEARD OF HAD HAPPENED COMING TO

810
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
SOON AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

811
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
>> YEAH, I SAW THE INITIAL

812
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
REPORTS LIKE EVERYONE DID THAT

813
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
MAYBE JUST THE SHOOTER HAD BEEN

814
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
KILLED.

815
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN IT WAS 27

816
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
PEOPLE MURDERED.
AND GROWING UP, HAVING GROWN UP

817
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
TEN MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD FROM

818
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
THAT COMMUNITY, I COULDN'T

819
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
BELIEVE THAT ONCE AGAIN MY LIFE

820
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
WAS GOING TO BE AFFECTED IN THIS

821
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
WAY BY SUCH HORRIBLE VIOLENCE.

822
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
>> YOU ACTUALLY LIVE LITERALLY

823
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
TEN MINUTES AWAY?
>> RIGHT.

824
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
THAT'S WHERE I GREW UP MY WHOLE
LIFE.

825
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
>> WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT

826
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
AMERICA THAT YOU'RE ATTACKED IN

827
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
A MOVIE THEATER BY A YOUNG MAN

828
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
WITH AN AR-15 ASSAULT RIFLE AND

829
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
THEN TEN MINUTES AWAY FROM WHERE

830
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
YOU LIVE, AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

831
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
IS SHOT UP WITH A YOUNG MAN WITH

832
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
EXACTLY THE SAME WEAPON?

833
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
>> IT'S CERTAINLY DISCOURAGING

834
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
IN SOME SENSE.

835
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT CAME AFTER

836
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
AURORA AND WHAT IS COMING AFTER

837
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
THIS HORRIBLE EVENT IS COMMUNITY

838
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
COMING TOGETHER, BANDING

839
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
TOGETHER IN AN INCREDIBLY

840
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
POSITIVE WAY.

841
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
AND I MEAN, THE SUPPORT I

842
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
RECEIVED FROM STRANGERS AFTER

843
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
AURORA IS AMAZING.

844
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
AND IT'S CLEAR IN SANDY HOOK THE

845
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
SAME THING IS HAPPENING THERE.

846
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
>> TERESA AND DAVE, LET ME

847
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
RETURN TO YOU.

848
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
AJ WAS YOUR SON.

849
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
HE WAS YOUR NEPHEW, DAVE.

850
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

851
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
STATES SAID LAST NIGHT THAT

852
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
THERE ARE FOUR OUTRAGES NOW ON

853
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
HIS WATCH INVOLVING MASS

854
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
SHOOTINGS.
HE'S GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

855
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I KNOW YOU MET WITH THE

856
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
PRESIDENT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED IN

857
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
AURORA.

858
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU THEN,

859
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
DAVE, AND WHAT HAPPENED?

860
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
>> WE WERE ALL GATHERED IN

861
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
AURORA, AND WE WERE SITTING IN

862
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
THE ROOM, WAITING FOR THE

863
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
PRESIDENT TO ARRIVE.

864
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
AND HE WALKED IN AND GRACIOUS.

865
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
IT WAS A VERY POSITIVE MEETING.

866
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
BUT HE STARTED IT OUT WITH I'M

867
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
NOT HERE AS THE PRESIDENT.

868
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'M HERE AS A FATHER.

869
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'M HERE AS A PARENT.

870
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
MY CHILDREN GO TO THE MOVIES.

871
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
WE NEED TO MAKE A CHANGE.

872
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
WE NEED TO BE HOLDING OUR

873
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE.

874
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
WE NEED TO MAKE POSITIVE CHANGE

875
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
BECAUSE IT'S TOO LATE FOR A.J.,

876
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
BUT THERE ARE OTHER CHILDREN

877
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
THROUGHOUT THAT ARE GOING TO BE

878
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
AFFECTED IF WE DON'T DO

879
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

880
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
AND TO THROW OUR HANDS UP AND TO

881
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
WALK AWAY FROM THIS ISSUE IS

882
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
LIKE SAYING IT'S OKAY THAT THIS

883
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
HAPPENED.
WE AREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING

884
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
ELSE ABOUT IT.

885
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
WE CAN'T CHANGE IT.

886
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
WELL, THAT'S GARBAGE.

887
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW IS

888
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE

889
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
OUR COMMUNITY BACK.

890
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
WE HAVE TO TAKE OUR WORLD BACK.

891
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
AND WE HAVE TO SAY THIS IS

892
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
UNACCEPTABLE.

893
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
WE HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT

894
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
SAY IT'S ILLEGAL TO STEAL.

895
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
BUT GUESS WHAT?
THOSE LAWS ARE STILL THERE

896
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
BECAUSE IT'S UNACCEPTABLE

897
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
BEHAVIOR.
AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

898
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
WITH GUNS.
WE HAVE TO SAY THIS IS

899
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
UNACCEPTABLE.

900
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
WE DON'T NEED THIS INDIVIDUAL TO

901
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
HAVE A GUN.
WE DON'T NEED -- WE NEED TO HAVE

902
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS DONE ON

903
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
EVERYBODY THAT PURCHASES A
FIREARM SO THAT WE CAN STOP

904
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
THESE INDIVIDUALS FROM GETTING

905
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
THE GUNS AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT

906
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
FOR THEM TO GET THESE WEAPONS,

907
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
BECAUSE IT'S JUST A MATTER OF

908
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000

BY UNSTABLE MENTAL PEOPLE.

1088
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
>> LET ME BRING YOU IN HERE.

1089
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
YOU RUN THE BRADY CAMPAIGN.

1090
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
BUT YOU HAVE A CONNECTION.

1091
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
YOUR OWN BROTHER WAS SHOT AT A

1092
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
SHOOTING OF THE EMPIRE STATE

1093
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
BUILDING IN THE LATE '90s.

1094
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
WE'VE DEBATED THIS A LOT THIS

1095
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
WEEK WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE.

1096
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
IT'S A VERY EMOTIVE DEBATE.

1097
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
DO YOU FEEL THAT WE HAVE GOT TO

1098
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
A TIPPING POINT HERE, THAT THE

1099
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
MOOD HAS CHANGED?

1100
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
BECAUSE I FEEL IT HAS.

1101
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
>> UNDOUBTEDLY.

1102
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
AND THE BIG REASON IS BECAUSE

1103
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
THESE VOICES THAT YOU HEAR, HAVE

1104
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
HERE ON YOUR SHOW TONIGHT ARE

1105
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
BEING HEARD.

1106
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
THESE INTEREST VOICES THAT NEED

1107
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
TO BE HEARD.
ONE IN THREE AMERICANS KNOW

1108
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN SHOT.

1109
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
WE'RE NOT AS UNIQUE AS IT MIGHT

1110
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
SEEM.

1111
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
32 PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY ARE

1112
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
MURDERED WITH GUNS EVERY SINGLE

1113
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
DAY, AND THE REALITY IS THE ONLY

1114
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
PLACE WHERE THIS IS A PARTISAN

1115
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
POLITICAL DEBATE IS IN THE HALLS

1116
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
OF CONGRESS.

1117
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
AND WHAT THIS TRAGEDY IS DOING

1118
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
IS IT'S EXPOSING THAT DISCONNECT

1119
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
BETWEEN WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

1120
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
WANT AND THE CONVERSATION WE

1121
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
WANT TO HAVE AND WHAT OUR

1122
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE DOING

1123
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
ABOUT IT.
AND TOMORROW WE'RE ALL GOING TO

1124
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
WASHINGTON, D.C. TO DELIVER 245

1125
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS AND THE
PRESIDENT.

1126
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
>> IT SHOULDN'T BE A POLITICAL

1127
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
ISSUE.

1128
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
>> NO.
>> IN AUSTRALIA AND IN BRITAIN

1129
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
WHEN THEY HAD THE SIMILAR

1130
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
OUTRAGES, IT WASN'T ABOUT

1131
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
POLITICS.

1132
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
IT WASN'T LEFT OR RIGHT.
>> NO.

1133
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
>> IT WAS ABOUT PEOPLE POWER

1134
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
GETTING ACTION.

1135
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
JESSICA, LET ME COME TO YOU.

1136
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A QUITE

1137
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
EXTRAORDINARY STORY.

1138
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
AND TELL ME QUICKLY THE

1139
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
CONNECTIONS YOU HAVE TO VARIOUS

1140
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
MASS SHOOTINGS.

1141
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
>> MY HUSBAND WAS A STUDENT AT

1142
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
COLUMBINE.

1143
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
HE WAS UNINJURED, BUT

1144
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
EMOTIONALLY SCARRED.

1145
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
>> HE SAW TWO STUDENTS KILLED?
>> CORRECT.

1146
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
AND THEN THE LITTLE GIRL I BABY

1147
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
SAT WAS KILLED IN PLATTE CANYON

1148
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
HIGH SCHOOL IN BAILEY, COLORADO

1149
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
IN 2006.

1150
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
>> SHE WAS SHOT DEAD?

1151
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
>> SHE WAS SHOT DEAD.

1152
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
AND BY A DERANGED GUNMAN WHO

1153
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
RANDOMLY ENTERED THAT SCHOOL.

1154
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
AND THEN MY COUSIN WAS KILLED AT

1155
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
THE AURORA THEATER.

1156
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
AND SITTING NEXT TO HIM WAS MY

1157
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL

1158
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
CLASSMATE, AND HE WAS SHOT THREE

1159
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
TIMES, BUT SURVIVED.

1160
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
>> AND JUST PURE CHANCE.

1161
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
THEY DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER.

1162
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
>> THEY DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER.

1163
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
>> SO YOU HAVE AN ASTONISHING

1164
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
CONNECTION TO SO MANY OF THESE

1165
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
MASS SHOOTINGS.

1166
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
>> YES.

1167
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
>> SO THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE,

1168
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
YOU'VE BEEN TAINTED BY WHAT IS

1169
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
GOING ON.
>> UH-HUH.

1170
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
>> WHY ARE THE AMERICANS SO

1171
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
RELUCTANT TO COLLECTIVELY RISE

1172
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
UP AND DEMAND ACTION, DO YOU

1173
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
THINK?

1174
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
>> BECAUSE I THINK IT REALLY

1175
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
TAKES SOMEBODY IN OUR POSITION

1176
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
ONCE WE'VE LOST SOMEBODY, ONCE

1177
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
WE'VE KNOWN SOMEBODY WHO IS

1178
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
INJURED AND ARE -- THEY'VE GOT

1179
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
LASTING POST TRAUMATIC STRESS

1180
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
SYNDROME TO REALLY SEE THE

1181
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
EFFECTS AND DAMAGES IT CAUSES,

1182
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
BECAUSE IT'S UNFORTUNATELY A

1183
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
VERY UNIQUE CLUB.
>> JERRY, LET ME BRING YOU IN

1184
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
HERE.
YOUR SON MATT, HE WAS 27.

1185
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
HE ALSO DIED SHIELDING HIS

1186
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
GIRLFRIEND, ANOTHER HERO IN

1187
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
AURORA IN THAT MOVIE THEATER.

1188
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
YOU WERE TELLING ME THAT HIS

1189
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
GRANDFATHER WAS IN THE POLICE.

1190
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
AND HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A

1191
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
FAMILY THAT RESPECTED GUNS.
>> YES.

1192
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
HE PROBABLY STARTED LEARNING THE

1193
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
RESPECT OF GUNS, LIKE YOU SAID,

1194
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
MY FATHER WAS A POLICE OFFICER

1195
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
FOR 23 YEARS.

1196
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
AND WHEN MY BOYS WERE LITTLE, HE

1197
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
WOULD TAKE THEM TO HIS SHOOTING

1198
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
RANGE ON HIS PROPERTY.

1199
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
BUT HE ALSO TAUGHT THEM NOT ONLY

1200
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
HOW TO SHOOT A GUN, BUT HOW TO

1201
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
RESPECT IT.

1202
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
AND SO WE'RE NOT -- AS FAR AS

1203
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
OUR FAMILY IS CONCERNED, MY

1204
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
HUSBAND AND I WERE NOT AGAINST

1205
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
GUNS.

1206
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
IT'S JUST THAT NOBODY NEEDS

1207
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
THESE AR-15s.

1208
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
IF YOU'RE GOING TO HUNT, YOU'RE

1209
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
NOT GOING TO SHOOT.

1210
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
>> THESE ARE MILITARY WEAPONS.

1211
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
>> RIGHT.
>> TO FIRE OFF

1212
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
100-MAGAZINE-POWERED GUNS IN THE

1213
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
WAY THAT HAPPENED IN AURORA, NO

1214
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
AMERICAN CIVILIAN NEEDS THAT

1215
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
OUTSIDE OF THE MILITARY AND THE

1216
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
POLICE FORCE.

1217
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
THAT IS WHAT ANGERS ME.
THAT'S WHAT THE DEBATE SHOULD BE

1218
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
FOCUSED ON.

1219
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
AMANDA WAS YOUR SISTER, MICAYLA

1220
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
WHO DIED AT 23 IN AURORA.

1221
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
AND ANITA, YOUR COUSIN.

1222
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
NOT ONLY DO YOU FEEL STRONGLY

1223
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
ABOUT THE FUNDRAISING THAT WENT

1224
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
ON AFTER THIS.

1225
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS POURS IN.

1226
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
YOU'RE CONCERNED WHAT HAPPENS
WITH IT AND PEOPLE TRYING TO

1227
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
HELP WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO THE

1228
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
FAMILIES AT SANDY HOOK.

1229
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
>> WE LEARNED A LOT IN AURORA

1230
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
WITH PEOPLE.
AFTER ONE OF THESE NATIONAL

1231
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
TRAGEDIES HAPPENS, THERE IS ALL

1232
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
THESE FUNDS STARTING UP THAT

1233
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
PEOPLE WANT TO HELP.

1234
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE VERY

1235
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
GENEROUS AND VERY GRACIOUS.

1236
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
AND THEY DO WANT TO HELP.

1237
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
AND THEY GIVE MONEY, AND THEY

1238
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
GIVE MONEY TO NONPROFITS.

1239
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
AND WHAT WE FOUND IN AURORA IS

1240
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
THAT THEY WERE GIVING MONEY TO A

1241
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
NONPROFIT THAT THEN GIVES TO IT

1242
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
OTHER NONPROFITS.

1243
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
WE'VE STARTED AS A GROUP

1244
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
EVERYONE HERE A ORGANIZATION

1245
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
CALLED VICTIMS FIRST.

1246
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
VICTIMSFIRST.ORG.
AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE

1247
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
THAT THE SANDY HOOK VICTIMS DO

1248
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
NOT GET VICTIMIZED LIKE WE DID

1249
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
THIS.
HAPPENED TO THE VICTIMS OF 9/11

1250
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
WHERE A HANDFUL OF FAMILIES HAD

1251
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
TO STAND UP AND STOP THE MONEY
FROM GOING ELSEWHERE.

1252
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
IT HAPPENED JUST RECENTLY WITH

1253
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
HURRICANE SANDY.

1254
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
YOU HAD THE STATEN ISLAND

1255
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
BOROUGH PRESIDENT COME OUT AND

1256
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
SAY STOP GIVING MONEY.

1257
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
WE'RE NOT SEEING ANY OF IT.

1258
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
AND IT'S JUST GOT TO STOP.

1259
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
>> IT'S A GREAT POINT.

1260
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
AND I WISH YOU EVERY SUCCESS

1261
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
WITH THAT, AMANDA.

1262
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I CAN SEE YOU'RE VERY DISTRAUGHT

1263
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
ABOUT THIS.

1264
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
IF THERE IS ONE THING YOU COULD

1265
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
SAY TO PEOPLE ABOUT GUNS, WHAT
WOULD YOU SAY?

1266
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
>> GOD, PIERS, PUT ME ON THE

1267
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
SPOT HERE.

1268
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I'M ABSOLUTELY AGAINST GUNS IN

1269
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
ANY FASHION.

1270
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
HUNT ME SOME DEER, BUT GOD, WE

1271
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
DON'T NEED THEM ON THE STREETS

1272
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
IN ANY FASHION.

1273
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
>> I THINK THE WORDS EVERYONE

1274
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
SHOULD TAKE EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY,

1275
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
ESPECIALLY COMING FROM FAMILIES
SUCH AS YOURS.

1276
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR
JOINING ME.

1277
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

1278
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
WE'LL TAKE A BREAK.

1279
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS HE WILL USE

1280
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
THE POWER OF HIS OFFICE TO

1281
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
ENSURE THERE ARE NO MORE

1282
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THE ONE IN

1283
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
CONNECTICUT.
THIS IS A MOMENT WHEN THE GUN

1284
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
POLICIES WILL CHANGE.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT WHEN WE

1285
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
COME BACK.

1286
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
>>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID LAST

1287
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
NIGHT IN NEWTOWN HE WAS GOING TO

1288
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
DO SOMETHING.
THE QUESTION IS WHAT WILL HE DO?

1289
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
JOINING ME IS CHARLES BLOW FROM

1290
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
"THE NEW YORK TIMES."

1291
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
THE PRESIDENT SEEMED PRETTY

1292
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
FIRED UP AND HE SEEMED PRETTY

1293
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
DETERMINED.

1294
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
IS HE GOING TO DO ANYTHING?

1295
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
AND IF HE DOES, WHAT IS HE GOING

1296
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
TO DO?
>> THAT'S THE QUESTION.

1297
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
WE'VE HAD AT LEAST FOR THE LAST

1298
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
FIVE YEARS IF NOT FOR THE LAST

1299
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
TEN IS A DAMPENING DOWN OF KIND

1300
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
OF DISCUSSION OF PEOPLE WHO WANT

1301
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
TO SEE SOME SORT OF SENSIBLE GUN

1302
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
CONTROL RESTRICTIONS.

1303
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
AND IN THAT VOID, THE NRA AND

1304
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
GUN, PRO-GUN ADVOCATES HAVE

1305
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
ACTUALLY GROWN STRONGER.

1306
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
YOU WOW WOULD HAVE THOUGHT MAYBE

1307
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
THEY SAW THERE WASN'T AS MUCH

1308
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
OPPOSITION AND DIDN'T HAVE TO

1309
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
SPEND MUCH MONEY.
IN FACT, THEIR SPENDING HAS

1310
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
INCREASED.
SO NOW YOU HAVE THE BIGGEST GUN

1311
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
CONTROL LOBBY IS PROBABLY ONE

1312
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
PEOPLE KNOW MOST IS THE BRADY

1313
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
CAMPAIGN.
THE NRA SPENDS ABOUT 66 TIMES AS

1314
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
MUCH ON LOBBYING AS THE BRADY

1315
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
CAMPAIGN.

1316
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
AND THEY SPENT DURING THE

1317
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTING TO

1318
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
CANDIDATES 4100 TIMES AS MUCH AS

1319
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
THE BRADY CAMPAIGN.

1320
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
THIS HAS NOW BECOME A ONE-SIDED

1321
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
DISCUSSION, AND AMERICA DESERVES

1322
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
A DISCUSSION.
>> THIS HAS BEEN A TIPPING

1323
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
POINT.

1324
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I THINK IT WAS SO GROTESQUE,

1325
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
COMING ON THE BACK OF AURORA,

1326
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
WHICH IN ITSELF WAS HORRIFYING

1327
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
BEYOND BELIEF, A MOVIE THEATER,

1328
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
NOW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN.

1329
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
BARACK OBAMA AFTER BEING

1330
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
REELECTED, HE HAS TO THINK OF A

1331
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
LEGACY NOW.

1332
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
DOES HE WANT HIS LEGACY TO BE A

1333
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
SERIES OF FURTHER MASS SHOOTINGS

1334
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
IN WHICH HE DID NOTHING.

1335
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
BECAUSE THERE ARE GOING TO BE

1336
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
MORE MASS SHOOTINGS.

1337
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR ALREADY IN
THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF

1338
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
INCREASING APPALLING DETAIL.

1339
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
THERE IS GOING TO BE WORSE.

1340
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
>> I THINK THAT YOU'RE RIGHT IN

1341
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
THE SENSE THAT EVERY CAUSE HAS

1342
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
AN INFLECTION POINT.

1343
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
AND THIS MAY BE THE INFLECTION

1344
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
POINT FOR THE CAUSE OF PEOPLE

1345
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
WHO WANT TO AT LEAST SEE A

1346
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
REINSTATEMENT OF THE ASSAULT

1347
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
WEAPONS BAN.

1348
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
BUT I THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE TO

1349
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
DO AS A SOCIETY, AND WHAT I HOPE

1350
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE PREPARED

1351
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
TO DO IS TO SAY WE HAVE TO START

1352
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
ON -- START STOPPING THE

1353
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
PROLIFERATION OF GUNS IN A

1354
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
SOECHLT WHAT WE'RE FAST

1355
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
APPROACHING AT THE MOMENT IS

1356
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
WHERE WE WILL HAVE MORE GUNS IN

1357
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
THIS COUNTRY THAN WE HAVE HUMAN

1358
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
BEINGS.
>> ACTUALLY, YOU HAVE ABOUT 300

1359
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
MILLION GUNS IN CIRCULATION.

1360
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
THE POPULATION IS --

1361
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
>> 311, RIGHT.

1362
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
>> HOW MANY CHILDREN.

1363
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
>> RIGHT.
>> YOU ALREADY HAVE MORE GUNS

1364
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
THAN THERE ARE ADULTS IN

1365
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
AMERICA.
>> ACCORDING TO GALLUP, 45% OF

1366
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
PEOPLE IN AMERICA SAY THEY HAVE

1367
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
A GUN IN THEIR HOME THAT MEANS

1368
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
MANY MORE PEOPLE HAVE MORE THAN

1369
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
ONE GUN IN THEIR HOMES.

1370
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
SEVEN OUT OF TEN PEOPLE SAY THEY

1371
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
HAVE ACTUALLY FIRED A GUN THIS

1372
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
THEIR LIFETIMES.

1373
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
THAT MEANS WE AS A CULTURE ARE

1374
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
GETTING TO A SATURATION POINT

1375
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
FROM WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

1376
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
PULL BACK.

1377
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
AND WHAT IS HAPPENING AFTER

1378
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
THESE SHOOTINGS, UNLIKE SAY WE

1379
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS, WE NEED TO

1380
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
STOP BUYING GUNS, IN COLORADO

1381
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
AFTER THAT SHOOTING FBI

1382
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR GUNS WENT

1383
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
UP BY MORE THAN 40%.

1384
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO

1385
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
STOP, THEY FEEL LESS SAFE AND

1386
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
THEY RUSH TO BUY MORE GUNS AND

1387
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
WHAT WE ARE -- BECAUSE WE DON'T

1388
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
HAVE THE ADVOCATES ON THE OTHER

1389
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
SIDE, FOR THE PEOPLE THAT SAY

1390
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS, I

1391
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO NOT BEAR

1392
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
ARMS, AND I SHOULD BE ABLE TO

1393
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
FEEL SAFE.

1394
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
WHO IS MY ADVOCATE WHO SAYS THAT

1395
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
FOR THIS PERSON WHO DECIDES THAT

1396
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I DON'T WANT TO OWN A GUN, HOW

1397
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
DO WE MAKE THAT PERSON FEEL SAFE

1398
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
OR DOES THAT PERSON GET TO A

1399
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
POINT WHERE THEY SAY BECAUSE 50,

1400
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
60, WHATEVER IT GETS TO BE,

1401
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAS A

1402
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
GUN, I ACTUALLY NEED TO GET ONE

1403
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
TO PROTECT MYSELF.

1404
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
>> THE POINT IS THERE IS ALREADY

1405
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
EXTENSIVE GUN CONTROL IN THE

1406
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
COUNTRY.

1407
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
THE GUN LOBBY MAKES OUT THIS

1408
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
HIDEOUS NEW THING DESIGNED TO

1409
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
SHACKLE THEM BUT THIS PARTICULAR
TYPE OF RIFLE IS NOW THE

1410
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
PREFERRED MASS SHOOTER'S

1411
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
INSTRUMENT OF DEVASTATING MURDER

1412
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
AND THAT IS WHY IT HAS TO BE

1413
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
TARGETED.
THE LAST THREE SHOOTINGS, THE

1414
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
AR-15 WAS USED BECAUSE IT LOOKS

1415
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
AS THE GUNN RIGHTS TOLD ME LIKE

1416
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
THE FERRARI OF WEAPONS.

1417
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
THIS HE HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT OF

1418
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
CIRCULATION.
>> YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE

1419
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
COMMITTING THESE MASS SHOOTINGS

1420
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
WITH REGULAR HUNTING RIFLES OR

1421
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
MASS SHOOTINGS WITH REGULAR

1422
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
REINVOLVERS.
THESE ARE SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS,

1423
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
AND THERE IS A LOT OF CONFUSION.

1424
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
A GUEST WAS SAYING THIS IS NOT

1425
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON.

1426
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT

1427
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
DOES.
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE TRIGGER

1428
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
GO -- THAT THE HAMMER GO ALL THE

1429
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
WAY BACK AND YOU SQUEEZE AGAIN

1430
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
REALLY HARD.

1431
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
THE TRIGGERS ARE VERY SENSITIVE.

1432
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
YOU JUST PULSE THE FINGER.

1433
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
YOU CAN GET OFF THREE TO FIVE

1434
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
ROUNDS IN ONE SECOND.

1435
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
>> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

1436
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
THE POWER OF A AUTOMATIC AND THE

1437
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
AR-15s IF THEY HAVE THE RIGHT

1438
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
EQUIPMENT.

1439
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,000
THAT'S THE REALITY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
e.

1440
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Meet the five-passenger
Ford C-MAX Hybrid.

1441
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
C-MAX says ha.

1442
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
C-MAX says wheeee.

1443
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Which is what you get,
