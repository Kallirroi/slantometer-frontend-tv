U AND A FRIEND
DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING...

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
NOT SO SMART.

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
THAT'S RIGHT. THERE--

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
OUR CLASS WAS DIVIDED UP INTO,
LIKE, SMALL GROUPS ON BUSES,

AND MY FRIEND DECIDED
THAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH

57
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000

AND THE DRIVER AND ALL OF US
WERE NOT TOO THRILLED WITH THAT,

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
LEAVE THEM ALONE.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
