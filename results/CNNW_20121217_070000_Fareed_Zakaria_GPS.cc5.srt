1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
>>> COMING UP, YOU'RE GOING TO

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
HEAR FROM A SUNDAY SCHOOLTEACHER

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
HERE IN NEWTOWN, WHO'S TRYING TO

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
HELP HER YOUNG STUDENTS DEAL

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
WITH THIS TRAGEDY.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
[ Male Announcer ]
THIS IS STEVE.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
HE LOVES RISK.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
BUT WHETHER
HE'S CLIMBING EVEREST,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
SCUBA DIVING THE
GREAT BARRIER REEF WITH SHARKS,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
OR JUMPING INTO THE MARKET,
HE GOES WITH PEOPLE HE TRUSTS,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
WHICH IS WHY HE TRADES
WITH A COMPANY

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
THAT DOESN'T NICKEL AND DIME
HIM WITH HIDDEN FEES.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
SO HE CAN WORRY
ABOUT OTHER THINGS,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
LIKE WHAT THE MARKET IS DOING

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
AND BEING READY,
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
WHICH ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE,
FROM TD AMERITRADE.

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON.

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
AND I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
DAD.

22
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
>> THAT WAS ROBBIE PARKER

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
TALKING ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
EMILIE WHO WAS 6 YEARS OLD, SHE

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
DIED ON SATURDAY.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THE FAMILY MEETING TONIGHT WITH

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA AT THE SCHOOL.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000

WEEKEND.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
THIS MORNING, SOME OF THE

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
CHILDREN SURVIVED THE SHOOTING,

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
WENT TO SUNDAY SCHOOL JUST LIKE

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
THEY DID EVERY WEEK, IT SOUNDS

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
LIKE A SIMPLE THING, WASN'T

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
SIMPLE OR EASY FOR ANYONE.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
NOT FOR THE CHILDREN OR THEIR

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
TEACHER.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
>> Reporter:HIS IS WHERE SOME

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
OF THE CHILDREN WHO WERE KILLED

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY PRAYED

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
AND WENT TO SUNDAY SCHOOL.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
SHE WAS BACK ON THIS SUNDAY FOR

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
ALL HER STUDENTS, INCLUDING

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
THOSE WHO SURVIVED.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
>> YOU HAD A LOT OF CHILDREN

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
HERE IN THIS ROOM, WHAT WAS THAT
LIKE FOR YOU.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
>> IT WAS A LITTLE BIT -- IT WAS

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
VERY SCARY, BECAUSE I SPENT

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
YESTERDAY TRYING TO PREPARE FOR

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
TODAY.

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
TO HAPPEN.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
AND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE A CHILD

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
RAISED THEIR HAND.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I SAID YES, AND THEY SAID, MY

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
FRIENDS DIED.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
LATER ON WHEN WE GOT TO THE

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
POINT WHERE WE PRAYED, PRETTY

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
MUCH EVERY CHILD IN HERE HAD A

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
PRAYER, AND MANY OF THEM WERE MY

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
FRIEND JACK DIED, MY FRIEND BEN

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
DIED, MY FRIEND CHARLOTTE DIED.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
WE PRAYED, WE PROBABLY PRAYED

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
MORE THAN WE'VE EVER PRAYED

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
BEFORE.

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
>> SHE KNEW THERE WOULD BE

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
ANXIETY AMONG THE CHILDREN AND

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
THEIR PARENTS.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
SHE SAW BOTH.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
>> WE WERE A LITTLE WORRIED.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
WE HAD KIDS WHOSE PARENTS SAID

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO COME TO

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
CLASS.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
IT'S LIKE A SCHOOL AND THEY WERE
WORRIED.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
ONE GIRL DIDN'T WANT TO COME

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
BECAUSE BEN WOULDN'T BE THERE.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THERE WAS A LOT OF ANXIETY.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
BEN WOULD HAVE BEEN SITTING

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
RIGHT HERE ON THIS CARPET WITH

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
ME.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
SO WHEN THE KIDS BRING IT UP

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
THAT MY FRIEND BEN DIED, I HAD

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
TO DO THE ATTENDANCE, WE HAVE

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
ATTENDANCE SIGN IN PAGES FOR THE

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
PARENTS.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
THEY HAVE TO SIGN THEM IN AND

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
OUT.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
AS I WAS PUTTING THEM IN THE BOX

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
LAST NIGHT, THE FIRST GRADE PAGE

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
HAD BEN'S NAME ON IT.

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I THOUGHT, THIS IS GOING TO BE

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
HANGING ON THE HALL WALL WITH

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
HIS NAME ON IT, AND HE WOULDN'T

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
BE SIGNED IN.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
SO I PRINTED IT WITH HIS NAME

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
OFF.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
AND WHEN I TALKED TO THE PASTOR

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
ABOUT IT, IT REALLY HIT ME, I

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
ERASED HIS NAME.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
>> THIS ONE SAYS CHARLOTTE IS

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
SAFE.

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
>> YES.

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
THAT WAS FOR CHARLOTTE WHO WENT

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
HERE.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
>> CHARLOTTE WAS 6 YEARS OLD.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
ANOTHER CARD READS IN PART

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
VOGELMAN SAYS SHE FELT PRIDE, A

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
STRENGTH SHE SAW IN HER SUNDAY

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
SCHOOL CHILDREN.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
>> I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH KIDS

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
MY WHOLE ADULT LIFE.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
THEY'RE MY KIDS, THEY'RE MY

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
KIDS.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
PEOPLE ON FACEBOOK ARE LIKE, I'M

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
SO GLAD YOUR KIDS ARE OKAY.

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'M OFFYOUSLY VERY KIDS THAT MY

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
KIDS ARE NOT OKAY, BUT MY KIDS

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
ARE NOT OKAY, MY KIDS DIED,

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
THAT'S HOW EVERYONE FEELS IN

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
NEWTOWN.

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
SORRY.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
THEY'RE BABIES.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
>> I MEAN, FACED WITH THAT

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
HORRIBLE DILEMMA WHETHER TO TAKE

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
THE CHILD'S NAME OFF THE BOARD,

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
HOW IS SHE DOING THROUGH ALL

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
THIS.

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
>> TAKING THAT NAME DOWN, THAT'S

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
BEEN THE MOMENT FOR HER.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
EVERYONE'S HAD A MOMENT.

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
THE WAY SHE'S GETTING THROUGH IT

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
IS STRANGELY ENOUGH THE CHILDREN

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
THEMSELVES, THEIR HONESTY, THEY

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
KNOW THEY HAVE TO BE STRONG FOR

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
THESE CHILDREN.

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
RECEIVING ALL THESE KIND WORDS

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
FROM PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD,

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
THAT'S BEEN A SOURCE OF

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
ENCOURAGEMENT.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
SHE WAS WONDERING WHAT SHE WAS

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
GOING TO DO FOR THE LESSON

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
TODAY, WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
TO THESE CHILDREN.

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
SHE GOT A KIND LETTER FROM

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
SOMEONE FROM LITTLETON COLORADO,

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
FROM THE CLERGY THERE, THEY

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN THROUGH A
LOT.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
ONLY WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
IT, CAN YOU OFFER THE ADVICE TO

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
GET THROUGH IT THIS TIME.

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
>> HOPEFULLY HER FAITH IS

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
GETTING HER THROUGH AS WELL.

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
REMARKABLE.

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
>>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000

SPOT ON EARTH.

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH OF
OUR GREAT STATES FOLKS VISIT.

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
MISSISSIPPI,

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
ALABAMA,

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
WE'VE DECIDED TO PUT
ASIDE OUR RIVALRY.

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME TO
VISIT ANYONE OF OUR STATES.

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
THE BEACHES AND WATERS
COULDN'T BE MORE BEAUTIFUL.

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
TAKE A BOAT RIDE, GO FISHING
OR JUST LAY IN THE SUN.

177
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
WE'VE GOT COASTLINE TO EXPLORE
AND WILDLIFE TO PHOTOGRAPH.

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
AND THERE'S WORLD CLASS DINING

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
SO FOR A GREAT VACATION
THIS YEAR, COME TO THE GULF.

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
ITS ALL FABULOUS BUT
I GIVE FLORIDA THE EDGE.

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
RIGHT AFTER MISSISSIPPI.

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000

575
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
HOLY GOD, MANY OF THESE MEN AND

576
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
WOMEN YOU CALLED INTO SERVICE

577
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
WHEN THEY WERE JUST CHILDREN.

578
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
THEY WANTED TO BE POLICE

579
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS AND

580
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
CARE FOR THOSE THAT WERE IN

581
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
NEED, LORD.

582
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
YOU GAVE THEM GIFTS FOR THEIR

583
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
LIFE TO SERVE.

584
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
YOU ASKED THEM TO PAY A HIGH

585
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
PRICE FOR ALL THE SKILLS THAT

586
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN, FOR THE

587
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
STRENGTH THAT THEY HAVE.

588
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
YOU EQUIPPED THEM.

589
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
YOU GAVE THEM A WILLINGNESS TO

590
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
LEARN, TO TRAIN, TO STUDY.

591
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
YOU GAVE THEM A WILLINGNESS TO

592
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
SERVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

593
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
WHEN A CALL WOULD COME IN.

594
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
AND YOU GAVE THEM THE

595
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
WILLINGNESS TO RESPOND WHEN THIS

596
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
TOWN NEEDED THEM THE MOST.

597
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
LORD, WE THANK YOU FOR THOSE IN

598
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
THIS TOWN THAT RESPONDED, BUT WE

599
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
THANK YOU ALSO FOR THOSE

600
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT CAME

601
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
WHEN THE NEED WAS GIVEN.

602
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
WE THANK YOU, LORD, FOR THEIR

603
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000

604

THEIR COURAGE.

605
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
SO WE ASK YOU, LORD, TO WALK

606
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
WITH THEM IN THE DAYS AHEAD, TO

607
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
SURROUND THEM WITH YOUR ANGELS,

608
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
TO GIVE THEM PEOPLE WHO WILL

609
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
LISTEN TO THEIR STORY, TO LISTEN

610
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
TO WHAT THEY SAW THAT WAS NOT

611
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
FOR ANYONE TO EVER SEE.

612
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
LORD, WE PLACE EACH AND EVERY

613
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
ONE OF THESE MEN AND WOMEN IN

614
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
YOUR CARE, BUT WE WILL BE

615
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
FAITHFUL TO THEM.

616
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
WE WILL CARE FOR THEM.

617
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
WE WILL CONTINUE TO EQUIP THEM,

618
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
AND WE WILL KEEP THEM EVER IN

FATHERS AND THE BROTHERS AND

623
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
SISTERS, THE GRANDPARENTS.

624
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
FOR ALL OF YOU TODAY.

625
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
THIS IS A SACRED TEXT FROM THE

626
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
BAHA'I FAITH.

627
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
IT WAS WRITTEN AS A LETTER TO A

628
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
MOTHER WHO WAS MOURNING THE LOSS

629
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
OF HER CHILD.

630
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'VE ADAPTED IT FOR THIS

631
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
EVENING.

632
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
ALTHOUGH THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS

633
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
INDEED HEARTBREAKING AND BEYOND

634
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
THE LIMITS OF HUMAN ENDURANCE,

635
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
YET ONE WHO KNOWETH AND

636
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
UNDERSTANDETH IS ASSURED THAT

637
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
THE CHILD HAD NOT BEEN LOST, BUT

638
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
RATHER HAVE STEPPED FROM THIS

639
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
WORLD INTO ANOTHER, AND YOU WILL

640
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
FIND THEM IN THE DEVINE REALM.

641
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
THAT REUNION SHALL BE FOR

642
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
ETERNITY, WHILE IN THIS WORLD,

643
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
SEPARATION IS INEVITABLE AND

644
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
BRINGETH WITH IT A BURNING

645
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
GRIEF.

646
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
PRAISE BE UNTO GOD THAT THOU HAS

647
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
FAITH.

648
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
TURNING THY FAITH TO THE

649
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
EVERLASTING KINGDOM AND BELIEVE

650
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
IN THE EXISTENCE OF A HEAVENLY

651
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
WORLD.

652
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
THEREFORE, BE THOUGH NOT

653
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
DISCONSULATE.

654
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
DO NOT LANGUISH.

655
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
DO NOT SIGH.

659
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
THE DEVINE REALM.

660
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
>> THAT BELOVED CHILD ADDRESS

661
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
FROM THE HIDDEN WORLD.

662
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
OH, THOU KIND MOTHER AND FATHER,

663
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
THANK DEVINE PROVIDENCE THAT I

664
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
HAVE BEEN FREED FROM A SMALL AND

665
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
GLOOMY CAGE, AND LIKE THE BIRDS

666
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
OF THE MEADOWS, HAVE SOARED TO

667
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
THE DEVINE WORLD, A WORLD WHICH

668
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
IS SPACIOUS, ILLUMINED AND EVER

669
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
JOYOUS AND JUBILANT.

670
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
THEREFORE, LAMENT NOT, OH,

671
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
MOTHER AND FATHER, AND BE NOT

672
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
GRIEVED.

673
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I AM NOT OF THE LOST, NOR HAVE I

674
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
BEEN OBLITERATED AND DESTROYED.

675
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I HAVE SHAKEN OFF THE MORTAL

676
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
FORM AND HAVE RAISED MY BANNER

677
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
IN THIS SPIRITUAL WORLD.

678
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
FOLLOWING THIS SEPARATION IS

679
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
EVERLASTING COMPANIONSHIP.

THOU SHALT FIND ME IN THE HEAVEN

683
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
>> GOD, WE CALL YOU BY MANY

684
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
NAMES.

685
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
MODERN EYE, GREAT SPIRIT, HIGHER

686
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
WE ADDRESS YOU, YOU ARE ALWAYS

688
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
FATHER AND MOTHER TO US ALL, AND

689
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
WE ARE YOUR CHILDREN.

690
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
WE ARE YOUR FAMILY.

691
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
WE ASK YOUR BLESSING, LORD, UPON

692
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
THE COUNSELORS AND THE CLERGY

693
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
AND ALL THE CAREGIVERS AMONG US.

694
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
THEY HAVE GREAT PASSION FOR WHAT

695
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
THEY DO AND WHEN EVERYONE DOES

696
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
THEIR PASSION, WE ARRIVE AT

697
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
COMPASSION, AND WE THANK YOU.

698
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE MOST AWARE

699
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
OF THEIR NEEDS.

700
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
THEY, TOO, BECOME TIRED AND

701
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
SOMETIMES CLOSE TO BURNING OUT.

702
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
HOW MUCH WE NEED ONE ANOTHER.

703
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
WHEN YOU CALL JEREMIAH OR AMOS

704
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
OR BARUK AND ALL YOUR PRECIOUS

705
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
APOSTLES AND PROPHETS, THEY

706
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
HEDGED AT FIRST.

707
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
BUT EACH TIME, IN TURN, THEY

708
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
GAVE THEIR YES AND THEY FOLLOWED

709
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
YOU.

710
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
KNOWING THAT YOU WERE ALWAYS

711
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
AMONG THEM, ALWAYS SUPPORTING

712
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
THEM.

713
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
THEY WERE CONDUITS FOR YOUR EYES

714
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
AND YOUR EARS AND YOUR VOICE AND

715
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
YOUR HANDS.

716
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
THEY WERE THE CLAY KNOWING THAT

717
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
YOU ALWAYS WERE THE POTTER, AND

718
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
THEY WERE RESILIENT IN YOUR

719
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
HANDS.

720
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
WHEN JESUS FELT THE NEED TO GET

721
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
AWAY FOR SOME RESPITE HIMSELF,

722
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
HE WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS OR INTO

723
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
THE WILDERNESS OR OUT TO THE

724
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
SEASHORE, AND THE GREAT NUMBERS

725
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
OF PEOPLE IN NEED ALWAYS

726
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
FOLLOWED.

727
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
TIRED AND DRAINED AS HE WAS, HE

728
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
LOOKED ON THEM WITH COMPASSION.

729
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
ANOINT ALL YOUR PEOPLE, LORD,

730
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000

750
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
CHILDREN ABOVE ALL.

751
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
FAMILIES MOVE TO NEWTOWN BECAUSE

752
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
WE ARE A CARING AND LOVING
COMMUNITY.

753
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
WE ARE ALSO A PLACE THAT HAS

754
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
GREAT PRIDE IN OUR SCHOOLS,

755
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
PRIDE THAT PROPELS THE STUDENTS

756
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
IN THOSE SCHOOLS WITH THEIR

757
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
OUTSTANDING TEACHERS AND

WORTH.

761
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
THE HORROR THAT WAS VISITED UPON

762
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
OUR SANDY HOOK SCHOOL WAS NOT

763
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
DESERVED.

764
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
IT IS THE ANGRY AND DESPERATE

765
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
ACT OF A CONFUSED YOUNG MAN.

766
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
THERE IS NO BLAME TO BE LAID ON

767
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
US, BUT THERE IS A GREAT BURDEN

768
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
AND A GREAT CHALLENGE THAT WE

769
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
EMERGE WHOLE, THAT THESE

770
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
FAMILIES DEVASTATED BY

771
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
UNSPEAKABLE HARM KNOW AND TRUST

772
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
THAT WE LOVE THEM AND WILL DO

773
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP THEM

774
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
HEAL.

775
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I KNOW THAT NEWTOWN WILL

776
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
PREVAIL, THAT WE WILL NOT FALL

777
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
TO ACTS OF VIOLENCE.

778
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
IT IS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR OUR

779
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
TOWN, BUT IT DOES NOT DEFINE US.

780
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
WE ARE NEWTOWN, A SPECIAL AND

781
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000

782
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
WE ARE DEFINED BY ACTS OF

COURAGE, BY ACTS OF LOVE, AND BY

784
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
OUR CONTINUING COMMITMENT AND

798
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
THANK YOU.

799
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
WHEN I CAME IN TO THE HALL, ONE

800
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
OF THE FIRST SONGS TO BE PLAYED

801
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
ON THE PIANO WAS "AMAZING

802
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
GRACE," WHICH IS FITTING FOR ANY

803
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
NUMBER OF REASONS.

804
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
IT'S BECOME AN ANTHEM FOR FIRST

805
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
RESPONDERS, IT HAS GREAT WORDS,

806
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
IT ALSO SPEAKS OF THE POWER OF

807
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
FAITH.

808
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
"AMAZING GRACE" WAS WRITTEN BY A

809
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
FORMER SEA CAPTAIN ENGAGED IN

810
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
THE SLAVE TRADE.

811
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
AND THOSE PROFOUND WORDS THAT "I

812
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
ONCE WAS LOST BUT NOW AM FOUND"

813
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
SPEAK TO US ON A DAY LIKE TODAY.

814
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
WHEN WE ARE CALLED UPON, DARE I

815
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
SAY REQUIRED TO BE INVESTED IN

816
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
OUR FAITH, A FAITH SO EVIDENT IN

817
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
THIS ROOM AND IN THIS COMMUNITY

818
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
AT THIS TIME.

819
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
A FAITH THAT IS, AFTER ALL, AT

820
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
ITS VERY CORE, A GIFT FROM GOD.

821
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
A FAITH IN WHICH WE FIND COMFORT

822
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
AND HOPE AND COMPASSION.

823
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
A FAITH IN WHICH WE ARE GIVEN

824
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
THE POWER TO GO ON.

825
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
TO SURVIVE THAT WHICH HAS

826
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
BEFALLEN THIS COMMUNITY, THESE

827
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
FAMILIES, THESE SPOUSES, THAT

828
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
WHICH HAS HAPPENED AND IS

829
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
UNIMAGINABLE AND UNTHINKABLE AND

830
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
WAS NEVER, WE THOUGHT, INTENDED

831
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
TO BE VISITED UPON US HERE IN

832
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
CONNECTICUT OR IN NEWTOWN OR IN

833
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
SANDY HOOK.

834
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I CHOOSE TO THINK ABOUT THE FACT

835
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
THAT IN THE COMING DAYS WE WILL

836
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
OFFICIALLY ENTER WINTER.

837
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
AND THAT IS ALWAYS TO BE

838
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
FOLLOWED BY THE SPRING.

839
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT IN

840
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
WINTER, EACH TIME I SEE THE

841
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
BEGINNING OF A SNOWFALL, I WILL

842
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
BE THINKING OF THOSE 27 SOULS

843
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
LOST JUST A FEW DAYS AGO.

844
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
EACH TIME THE DAY GETS A LITTLE

845
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
LONGER, I WILL THINK AND DREAM

846
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,000
OF THE LIVES THAT MIGHT HAVE

847
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
BEEN AND THE LIVES THAT WERE SO

848
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
FULL OF GRACE.

849
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
AND WHEN THE FLOWERS START TO

850
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
COME OUT OF THE GROUND, AND WHEN

851
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
THEY RISE UP, I WILL KNOW THAT

852
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
WE ARE IN TOUCH WITH THOSE THAT

853
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
WE HAVE LOST IN THE LAST FEW

854
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,000
DAYS.

855
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
WE WILL GO ON.

856
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
WE WILL FIND STRENGTH.

857
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
FAITH IS A GIFT, AS IS OUR

858
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
ABILITY TO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER

859
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
IN OUR GREATER COMMUNITY.

860
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
TO ALL OF YOU, I EXTEND MY MOST

861
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
PROFOUND CONDOLENCES ON BEHALF

HAVE WITNESSED, AND WHAT YOU

865
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
HAVE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED.

866
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
WE WILL MOVE ON, WE WILL NEVER

867
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
FORGET, WE WILL IN MANY WAYS BE

868
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
MADE STRONGER FOR WHAT HAS

869
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
TRANSPIRED, AND WE WILL GET

870
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
BETTER.

00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
WE ARE BLESSED TODAY TO HAVE

872
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000

THIS COMMUNITY.

00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
ARE ACHIEVING FOR US AN ETERNAL

898

GLORY THAT FAR OUTWEIGHS THEM

899
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
ALL, SO WE FIX OUR EYES NOT ON

900
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
WHAT IS SEEN, BUT ON WHAT IS

901
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
UNSEEN.

902
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
SINCE WHAT IS SEEN IS TEMPORARY,

903
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
BUT WHAT IS UNSEEN IS ETERNAL.

904
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
FOR WE KNOW THAT IF THE EARTHLY

905
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
TENT WE LIVE IN IS DESTROYED, WE

906
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
HAVE A BUILDING FROM GOD, AN

907
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
ETERNAL HOUSE IN HEAVEN NOT

908
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
BUILT BY HUMAN HANDS.

909
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,000
WE GATHER HERE IN MEMORY OF 20

910
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN AND SIX

911
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
REMARKABLE ADULTS.

912
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
THEY LOST THEIR LIVES IN A

913
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
SCHOOL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY

914
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
SCHOOL IN A QUIET TOWN FULL OF

915
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
GOOD AND DECENT PEOPLE THAT

916
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
COULD BE ANY TOWN IN AMERICA.

917
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000

THE LOVE AND PRAYERS OF A

NATION.

920
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I AM VERY MINDFUL THAT MERE

921
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
WORDS CANNOT MATCH THE DEPTHS OF

922
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
YOUR SORROW, NOR CAN THEY HEAL

923
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
YOUR WOUNDED HEARTS.

924
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I CAN ONLY HOPE IT HELPS FOR YOU
