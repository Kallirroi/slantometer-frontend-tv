1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
IT'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL EVENT

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME FOR

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
HEALING.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
AND AS LONG AS EVERYONE GETS THE

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
PROPER HELP, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
SOMETHING YOU SHAKE OFF VERY

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
EASILY AND CERTAINLY NOT FOR

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
LITTLE PEOPLE.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
RINGING BUT THIS COMMUNITY HAS

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
COME TOGETHER TO MOURN TOGETHER

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
DEADLIEST SHOOTING RAMPAGES IN

THEY WENT TO THE SUSPECT'S

I WANT TO SAY GOOD MORNING TO

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
DIFFICULT MORNING, BUT WE ARE

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
SPENDING IT TOGETHER HERE.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'M JOHN BERMAN.

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
MORNING AND WILL GET SADDER IN A

48
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
FEW MOMENTS.

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
JUST A FEW MOMENTS FROM WHERE WE

50
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
ARE STANDING, A PRESS CONFERENCE

51
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN WHERE THEY ARE

52
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
GOING TO RELEASE THE NAMES, WE

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
THINK, OF MANY OF THE PEOPLE

54
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
KILLED.

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
DAVID ARIOSO OF CNN WAS ONE OF

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
THE FIRST ON THE SCENE.

57
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
DAVID WENT TO THE FIREHOUSE YOU

58
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
KEEP HEARING REFERENCES TO WHERE

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
PARENTS WERE THINKING THEY WERE

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
GOING TO MEET THEIR KIDS.

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
DAVID, WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY?
>> WELL, BETWEEN THE EARLY

62
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
MORNING HOURS, PARENTS WOULD

63
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
FILE TOWARDS THIS FIREHOUSE AND

64
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
WOULD BASICALLY TRY TO GET A

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
SENSE OF WHETHER OR NOT THEIR

66
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
KIDS, THEIR LOVED ONES WERE

67
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
ALIVE.
TOWARD THE EARLY PART OF THE

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
MORNING, YOU WOULD SEE PARENTS

69
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
WALKING OUT TEARY EYED, SHAKEN,

70
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
BUT WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

71
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
AS THE DAY PROGRESSED, YOU WOULD

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
SEE PARENTS WALKING IN PAIRS,

73
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
WALKING WITH STATE TROOPERS OR

74
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
FIREMAN WITHOUT A CHILD M. OF

75
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
THE PARENTS WERE BESIDES

76
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
THEMSELVES WITH GRIEF.

77
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
IT IS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS

78
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
THAT YOU CAN'T PUT INTO WORDS SO

79
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
MUCH.
THAT FIRE STATION THAT BECOMES

80
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
SORT OF A WEIGH STATION FOR MANY

81
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
OF THE VICTIMS M OF THE VICTIMS

82
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
FAMILIES CONTINUES TO BE

83
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
POPULATED BY EMERGENCY VEHICLES

84
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
IN THE AREA.
BUT THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE

85
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
STORIES THAT YOU LOOK FOR WORDS

86
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
TO SORT OF DESCRIBE THE

87
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
SENTIMENT THAT THE PEOPLE ARE

88
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
FEELING HERE AND YOU'RE JUST PUT

89
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
AT A LOSS.

90
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
>> Reporter: WE ARE STILL

91
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
STANDING BY, THE OFFICIALS HAVE

92
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
NOT ARRIVED.

93
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
WE KNOW THEY ARE HERE, THEY JUST

94
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
HAVEN'T GONE TO THE PODIUM YET.

95
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
JOHN, YOU WERE AT A LOCATION

96
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
WHERE THERE WAS ONE OF A FEW

97
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
VIGILS LAST NIGHT.
WE ARE AT THE STAGING AREA WHERE

98
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
OFFICIALS ARE GIVING THE PRESS

99
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
CONFERENCES.
THE SCHOOL IS OVER THERE BEHIND

100
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
US.

101
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
THIS IS A SMALL TOWN THAT CAN'T

102
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
ACCOMMODATE EVERYONE HERE TO

103
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
COVER IT, BUT DAVID WAS THERE

104
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
FOR -- HE HAD THE POINT OF

105
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
SEEING THESE PARENTS.

106
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE, THOSE

107
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
PARENTS TOOK THEIR KIDS.

108
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
YOU KNOW IF YOU GOT YOUR KID BUT

109
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO DIDN'T GET

110
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
THEIR KID.

111
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO FIND

112
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
OUT.

113
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
THIS IS GOING TO OPEN UP A WHOLE

114
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
NEW SET OF WOUNDS.

115
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
>> AND THERE ARE FOUR ADULTS WE

116
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
DON'T KNOW THE NAMES OF THAT IS

117
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
INVOLVED IN THIS.

118
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
THIS IS JUST ALL STARTING TO
TRICKLE IN.

119
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
WE SPOKE TO FAMILIES YESTERDAY,

120
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
CHILDREN WHO WENT THIS

121
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
TRANSPIRED WERE CROWDED IN A

122
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
CLASSROOM.

123
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I SPOKE TO A THIRD GRADE

124
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
8-YEAR-OLD KID BASICALLY TOLD IN

125
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
THE BACK BY TEACHERS TO STAY

126
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
DOWN, KEEP AWAY.

127
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
HER PARENTS ENDED UP RUSHING TO

128
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
GET HER AT THE FIRE STATION AND

129
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
RECEIVED THIS AUTOMATED MESSAGE

130
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
NOT KNOWING IF THEIR CHILDREN

131
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
WERE ALIVE OR DEAD.

132
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
NOT EVEN REALLY KNOWING WHICH

133
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
SCHOOL THE SHOOTING HAD TAKEN

134
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
PLACE IN.
THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WAS FLOCKING

135
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
TO SCHOOLS IN AND AROUND THE

136
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
REGION NOT KNOWING WHAT

137
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
TRANSPIRED.

138
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I DON'T THINK MANY OF US THOUGHT
THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN THIS

139
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
BAD.
AGAIN, JUST WATCHING SOME OF

140
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
THESE PARENTS WHACK UP THAT HILL

141
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
YESTERDAY, THOSE THAT WERE
WILLING TO SPEAK WITH US WE

142
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
COULD ONLY DO SO IN GASPS AND

143
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
BREATHS.
MOST DIDN'T WANT TO FOR

144
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
UNDERSTANDABLE REASONS.

145
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
>> Reporter: JOHN, MANY OF THE

146
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
PARENTS ARRIVED AT THE SCENE NOT

147
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
KNOWING, NOT KNOWING THAT THEIR

148
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
KIDS MAY NOT SHOW UP.

149
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THE INITIAL REPORTS AS YOU

150
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
RECALL YESTERDAY MORNING WAS

151
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
THEY CALLED FOR TWO AMBULANCES.

152
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
THIS DID NOT LOOK LIKE WHAT IT

153
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
WAS GOING TO END UP BEING.

154
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
JOHN?
>> THAT'S SO TRUE, ALI.

155
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE GOING THROUGH

156
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BUT WE

157
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
SHOULD SAY RIGHT NOW THIS

158
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
COMMUNITY IS GOING THROUGH IT

159
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
TOGETHER.
I'M STANDING OUTSIDE ST. ROSE OF

160
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
LIMA CATHOLIC CHURCH WHERE LAST

161
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
NIGHT THERE WAS A VIGIL.

162
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE INSIDE AND

163
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
OUTSIDE HERE TO MOURN TOGETHER,

164
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
TO GRIEVE TOGETHER.

165
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
WE WALKED INSIDE THE CHURCH A

166
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
LITTLE WHILE AGO.

167
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THERE ARE TWO BULLETIN BOARDS

168
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY

169
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
STARTED POSTING MESSAGES OF

170
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
SOLIDARITY, GRIEF AND

171
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
REMEMBRANCE.

172
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
THERE ARE THE VICTIMS, 20

173
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
CHILDREN, AGES 5 TO 10.

174
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
WE ARE AWAITING A NEWS

175
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
CONFERENCE NOW WHERE WE EXPECT

176
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
WE WILL LEARN THE NAMES OF THESE

177
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
VICTIMS AS WELL AS SIX ADULTS

178
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
WHO WERE KILLED AT THAT SCHOOL.

179
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
WE WANT TO LEARN SO MUCH MORE

180
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON, SO MANY

181
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THIS.

182
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I SPOKE TO THE PARENT OF A

183
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
SURVIVOR A SHORT WHILE AGO WHO

184
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
IS TALKING TO HIS DAUGHTER, AN

185
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
8-YEAR-OLD GIRL, A THIRD GRADER

186
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
WHO SURVIVED THE SHOOTING.

187
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
SHE WAS LOCKED IN A CLOSET IN

188
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
HER CLASSROOM AS IT WAS GOING

189
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
ON.
THEN SHE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST

190
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
PEOPLE BROUGHT TO THE FIREHOUSE.

191
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
SHE HAS A 10-YEAR-OLD BROTHER AT

192
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
ANOTHER SCHOOL.

193
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
THIS 8-YEAR-OLD THIRD BADER AND

194
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
10-YEAR-OLD TELLING THEIR FATHER

195
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
THEY DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO

196
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
SCHOOL ON MONDAY.

197
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
THAT'S SO UNDERSTANDABLE.

198
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
SO MANY PEOPLE TRYING TO WORK

199
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
THROUGH THIS, BUT AS I SAID,

200
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THIS TOWN OF NEWTOWN,

201
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
CONNECTICUT, 60 MILES OUTSIDE OF

202
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
NEW YORK CITY RIGHT NOW WORKING

203
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
THROUGH IT TOGETHER.

204
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
ALI?

205
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
>> Reporter: ONE OF THE THINGS

206
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, WE ARE

207
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
GOING TO HEAR THE NAMES.

208
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORT TO FIND

209
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
OUT WHO THE VICTIMS WERE.

210
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
POLICE ARE SAYING VERY CLEARLY,

211
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
THIS WAS A REAL DIFFICULT TASK

212
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
TO IDENTIFY.

213
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
THEY HAD TENTATIVE

214
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
IDENTIFICATIONS ON EVERYBODY BY

215
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
LAST NIGHT.

216
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
THEY WANTED POSITIVE

217
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
IDENTIFICATIONS AND WERE NOT

218
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
GOING TO LET THEIR KIDS, THEY

219
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
WERE NOT GOING TO LET THE

220
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
PARENTS INTO THE SCHOOL TO SEE

221
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
THEIR KIDS IN THAT SITUATION.

222
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
SO WE ARE WAITING FOR THAT

223
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
MOMENTARILY.
THE PARENTS KNOW WHO THEIR KIDS

224
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
ARE, OBVIOUSLY, THE CHILDREN

225
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
DIDN'T COME HOME LAST NIGHT.

226
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
THE BODIES ARE STILL IN THE

227
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
BUILDING, AND THAT'S AN ACTIVE

228
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
CRIME SCENE, BUT THERE'S ALSO

229
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
ANOTHER ACTIVE CRIME SCENE IN

230
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
THIS CITY, JOHN.

231
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
>> Reporter: THE ONE NAME POLICE

232
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
ALREADY RELEASED IS ADAM LANZA.

233
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
HE CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK ON THE

234
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT HIS HOME,

235
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
THEY MADE A STARTLING DISCOVERY.

236
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
MARY SNOW IS AT LANZA'S HOME.

237
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
MARY, WHAT DID POLICE FIND

238
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000

239
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
>> Reporter: JOHN, POLICE FOUND

240
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
THE BODY OF LANZA'S MOTHER,

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
NANCY LANZA.

242
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
IT IS BELIEVED HE LIVED IN A

243
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
HOME WITH HIS MOTHER IN A HOME

244
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
BEHIND ME.

245
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
POLICE HAVE BLOCKED OFF THIS

246
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
AREA.

247
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
THIS WAS REALLY COVERED BY

248
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
S.W.A.T. TEAMS YESTERDAY FOR

249
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
SEVERAL HOURS DURING THE DAY TO

250
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
THE POINT OF WHERE RESIDENTS HAD

251
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
BEEN EVACUATED FOR SEVERAL

252
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
HOURS.

253
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
AND BETWEEN RESIDENTS AND

254
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
FRIENDS, FORMER CLASSMATES, THEY

255
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
ARE PIECING TOGETHER MORE

256
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
INFORMATION ABOUT ADAM LANDA.

257
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
AND ONE OF THE PIECES OF THE

258
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
INFORMATION AND THE PROFILE OF

259
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
HIM, SUSAN CANDIOTTI WAS

260
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
REPORTING THAT A LAW ENFORCEMENT

261
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
OFFICIAL SAID THAT A FAMILY

262
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
MEMBER TOLD INVESTIGATORS THAT

263
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
HE HAD A FORM OF AUTISM.

264
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
A FORMER CLASSMATE DESCRIBED HIM

265
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
AS A STUDENT WHO WAS VERY

266
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
BRIGHT, BUT ALSO VERY REMOTE.

267
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT ONE OF HIS

268
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
FORMER CLASSMATES HAD TO SAY

269
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
LAST NIGHT.

270
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
>> HE WAS REALLY QUIET.

271
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
HE KEPT TO HIMSELF.

272
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I MEAN, HE WAS A LITTLE FIDGETY,

273
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
A LITTLE UNEASY SOMETIMES IF YOU

274
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
WERE TO LOOK AT HIM.

275
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I THINK HE WAS JUST SOCIALLY NOT

276
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
REALLY INTO GOING OUT THERE TO

277
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
MAKE AS MANY FRIENDS AS EVERYONE

278
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
WAS REALLY DOING IN ELEMENTARY

279
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL.

280
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
HE WAS JUST, HE PREFERRED TO

281
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
STAY TO HIMSELF.
>> Reporter: OF COURSE, THAT WAS

282
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
A FORMER CLASSMATE FROM MANY

283
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
YEARS AGO.

284
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS I SPOKE TO

285
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
YESTERDAY WOULD ONLY DESCRIBE

286
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
HIM AS BEING SOMEONE THAT SHE

287
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THOUGHT WAS TROUBLED.

288
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
AND OTHER RESIDENTS HAD

289
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
DESCRIBED HIM AS BEING A

290
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
DIFFERE

291
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
DIFFERENT, DIFFERENT AND ONE

292
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
DESCRIPTION AS A LITTLE OFF.

293
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
>> WE KNOW HE LIVED WITH HIS

294
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
MOTHER HERE IN NEWTOWN.

295
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
WHAT ABOUT THE WEAPONS THAT WERE

296
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
USED IN THIS SHOOTING, MARY?

297
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THEM?

298
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHERE HE

299
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
MAY HAVE PICKED THEM UP OR

300
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
GOTTEN THEM?

301
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
>> Reporter: CNN HAS LEARNED

302
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
THAT THE WEAPONS WERE LEGALLY

303
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
PURCHASED AND LEGALLY PURCHASED

304
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
BY HIS MOTHER.

305
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
WHAT WE FOUND OUT IS TWO

306
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
HANDGUNS WERE AT THE SCENE AND A

307
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE WAS FOUND IN

308
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
A CAR OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.

309
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
SO THOSE THREE WEAPONS WE HAVE

310
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
BEEN TOLD, WE HAVE BEEN

311
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
REPORTING THAT THEY WERE LEGALLY

312
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
PURCHASED.

313
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

314
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
TWO PISTOLS, A SIG SAUER AND A

315
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
GLAUCOMA PISTOL.

316
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
MARY SNOW, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

317
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
THAT.
THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS

318
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION RIGHT

319
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
NOW.
NIFS HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY, LATE

320
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
LAST NIGHT.

321
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY, WAS THE

322
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
SITE OF AN ACTIVE SCENE.

323
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
BOMB SQUAD MEMBERS, THE FBI

324
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
THERE, WHY?

325
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE

326
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
APARTMENT OF 24-YEAR-OLD RYAN

327
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
LANZA.

328
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
APPARENTLY ADAM LANZA HAD HIS

329
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
BROTHER'S I.D. ON HIM.

330
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
HIS I.D. WAS ON THE BODY OF ADAM

331
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
LANZA.
SO THEY WENT TO ASK THE BROTHER

332
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
SOME QUESTIONS AND WERE TALKING

333
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
TO HIM.

334
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
THEY ALSO REMOVED MATERIALS FROM

335
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
THAT APARTMENT.

336
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
JUST ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF THE

337
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
CONFUSION YESTERDAY DURING THIS

338
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
INVESTIGATION.

339
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
ALI?

340
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
>> Reporter: THAT DID ADD A LOT

341
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
OF CONFUSION TO THIS WHOLE

342
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
EPISODE.
THEY TOOK HIM INTO CUSTODY, THE

343
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
BROTHER, AND THEY WERE

344
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
INTERVIEWING THE FATHER.

345
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
IT HAS NOW BEEN ALMOST 24 HOURS

346
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
SINCE THE UNIMAGINABLE HAPPENED

347
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
HERE IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

348
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
IT ALL STARTED WHEN A GUNMAN

349
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
ENTERED THROUGH THE DOORS OF

350
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

351
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
WE ARE AWAITING A PRESS

352
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
CONFERENCE, YOU'RE LOOKING AT

353
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
THAT RIGHT NOW.

354
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
IT HAS NOT BEGUN, BUT I DO WANT

355
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
TO GIVE THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE

356
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
JOINED US A SENSE OF WHAT

357
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
HAPPENED.

358
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
TOM FOREMAN WALKS US THROUGH

359
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY MORNING

360
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
MINUTE BY MINUTE.

361
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
>> THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS

362
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
POINT ABOUT THE TIMELINE OF THE

363
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
SHOOTING REPORTED BY LAW

364
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000

SCHOOL AS BEST WE CAN PIECE IT

367
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
ALL TOGETHER.

368
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
9:30 IN THE MORNING, CLASSES HAD

369
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
BEEN UNDERWAY FOR A HALF HOUR.

370
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
MORE THAN 600 STUDENTS AND

371
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
APPROXIMATELY 50 FACULTY MEMBERS

372
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
INSIDE THE BUILDING.

373
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S A

374
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
MEETING JUST CONVENED BY SOME OF

375
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
THE SCHOOL OFFICIALS INCLUDING

376
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
THE PRINCIPAL IN A ROOM

377
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
SOMEWHERE RIGHT UP HERE, ABOUT

378
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
SEVEN OF THEM ALL GATHERED IN

379
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
ONE ROOM.

380
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
ABOUT 9:40, TEN MINUTES LATER,

381
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
AS BECK WE CAN MAKE IT OUT,

382
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
THAT'S WHEN THE GUNMAN APPEARS

383
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
TO HAVE ENTERED THE BUILDING.

384
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
HOW?

385
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
WE DON'T KNOW.
THEY HAD A NEW SECURITY SYSTEM

386
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
RIGHT UP HERE THAT MIGHT HAVE

387
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
KEPT HIM OUT, NOT SURE WHAT

388
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
HAPPENED WITH THAT.
POLICE PUT A LOT OF TIME LOOKING

389
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
AT A CAR PARKED RIGHT OUT HERE

390
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
IN THE FIRE LANE SUGGESTING THAT

391
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
IF THAT WERE HIS CAR, THAT IN

392
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
FACT HE MAY HAVE INDEED COME

393
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
RIGHT THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR

394
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
HERE INTO THE SCHOOL.

395
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING

396
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
AT THAT POINT START SAYING THAT

397
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
THEY ARE HEARING SHOTS.

398
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
9:41, THE CALLS START GOING IN

399
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
TO 911 AT THAT POINT.

400
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
AND THE PRINCIPAL, THE VICE

401
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
PRINCIPAL AND THE SCHOOL

402
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
PSYCHOLOGIST ALL GOING TOWARD

403
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
THE GUNFIRE NOW THE HALLWAY

404
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
ACCORDING TO A WITNESS.

405
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
ONLY THE VICE PRINCIPAL RETURNS

406
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
AND IS WOUNDED.

407
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
THERE'S MUCH SHOUTING.

408
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
THERE ARE MANY, MANY SHOTS OUT

409
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
THERE.
EVERYONE SAYS THEY HEAR IT.

410
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
AUTHORITIES SAY THE SHOOTING

411
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
ITSELF HAPPENED IN A RELATIVELY

412
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THEY

413
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
SAY THE GUNMAN DOES NOT ROAM

414
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
AROUND BUT GENERALLY STAYS IN

415
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
THIS AREA.

416
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
IN FACT, THEY SAY ALL THE

417
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
SHOOTING HAPPENED IN JUST TWO

418
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
ROOMS.

419
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
9:45, TEACHERS THROUGHOUT THIS

420
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
BUILDING ARE TRYING TO PROTECT

421
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
STUDENTS.

422
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
AND IN SOME CASES, THE STUDENTS

423
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
SAID THEY HELPED THEM HIDE AND

424
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
IN OTHERS THEY SEEM LIKE THE

425
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
TEACHERS TRIED TO GET THEM OUT

426
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
OF THE BUILDING.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS IN THIS

427
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
PICTURE FROM THE NEWTOWN B,

428
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
THERE WAS AN EFFORT TO GET THE

429
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
STUDENTS OUT.
THAT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU

430
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
HAVE HUNDREDS OF KIDS HERE

431
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
TRAUMATIZED AND VERY UPSET.

432
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
9:50, BY THIS TIME FOR SURE,

433
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
AGAIN, WE ARE NOT SURE OF THE

434
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
TIMELINE, IT'S MURKY, BUT THE

435
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
GUNMAN SOMEWHERE IN THIS PROCESS

436
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
HAS DIED.

437
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
POLICE OFFICERS SAY NO OFFICER

438
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
FIRED A SHOT SO IT IS BELIEVED

439
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
HE SHOT HIMSELF, BUT THIS WE DO

440
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
KNOW.
AS OFFICERS ARRIVED ON THE SCENE

441
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
FROM STATE AND LOCAL POLICE,

442
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
THEY SECURED THE ENTIRE BUILDING

443
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
AND THEY SPREAD OUT THROUGH IT

444
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

445
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
ARE NO OTHER GUNMEN AND TRYING

446
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
TO FIND ALL THE POCKETS OF

447
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
CHILDREN HIDING WITHIN THIS

448
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
BUILDING.

449
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
AT THAT POINT THEY START

450
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
ESCORTING THEM OUT OF THE

451
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
BUILDING AS WELL.

452
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
A DIFFICULT, DIFFICULT TIME.

453
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
AND THIS TIMELINE IS WHAT THE

454
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE GOING TO HAVE

455
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
TO BUILD UPON IN THE COMING

456
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
WEEKS TO CLARIFY, TO MAKE SURE

457
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
WE KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THINGS

458
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
HAPPENED AND HOW.

459
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000

BRINGS US, THERE'S SO MUCH WE

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
DON'T KNOW.

463
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR

464
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000

465
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
PRESS CONFERENCE.
NEW SECURITY MEASURES WERE JUST

466
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
IMPLEMENTED AT THE SCHOOL.
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHY THE

467
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
SCHOOL WAS TARGETED BY THIS

468
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
GUNMAN JUST YET.

469
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
WE ARE HOPING TO GET THOSE

470
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
ANSWERS.
THE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
WE HOPE TO GET FAIRLY SOON.

472
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000

473
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
NOW IS TO GET THE NAMES, THE

>>> THE AUTHORITIES HERE IN

563
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
NEWTOWN HAVE BEEN SO

564
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT KEEPING

565
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
EVERYONE UPDATED ON WHAT THEY

566
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000

THEY HELD A SERIES OF PRESS

NEWTON.
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE WAITING ON

YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE GATHERING IN

572
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
THE PICTURE.

573
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
WE DON'T HAVE THE OFFICIALS UP

574
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
YET AT THE PODIUM.

575
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
AMONG THE THINGS WE EXPECT THEM

576
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000

10 YEARS OLD.

579
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
SOME 20 KIDS.

580
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
ALSO THE SIX ADULTS.

581
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
WE HEARD SOME ABOUT THEM RIGHT

582
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
NOW INCLUDING THE PRINCIPAL AND

583
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST.

584
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
ALSO THE MOTHER OF THE ALLEGED

585
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
SHOOTER, ADAM LANZA, WAS KILLED.

586
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
NOT ON LOCATION HERE BUT

587
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
APPARENTLY IN THIS HOME, HER

588
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
HOME.
THIS HOUR WE'LL TALK TO A FRIEND

589
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
OF PRINCIPAL DAWN HOCHSPRUNG,

590
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
BUT FIRST, ALI, WE'LL TALK ABOUT

591
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
THE SITUATION THERE.

592
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
WHEN DO WE EXPECT, I CAN'T SEE

593
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
RIGHT NOW THAT PICTURE RIGHT

594
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
NOW, HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO THAT --

595
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
>> Reporter: I'LL GIVE YOU A

596
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
SENSE OF IT.

597
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'LL GIVE YOU A SENSE OF IT.

598
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
WE KNOW THE POLICE OFFICERS ARE

599
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
HERE.
WE KNOW THAT THE STATE POLICE

600
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
REPRESENTATIVES ARE HERE.

601
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
THEY WERE HERE A FEW MINUTES

602
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
AGO.
I THINK THEY ARE REALLY TRYING,

603
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
YOU JUST MENTIONED THEY ARE

604
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
REALLY WORKING VERY HARD TO GET

605
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
INFORMATION OUT AS QUICKLY AS

606
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
POSSIBLE.
AND QUESTIONS THAT THEY HAVE NOT

607
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
BEEN ABLE TO ANSWER, THEY KEEP

608
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
TELLING US, WE'LL BE BACK IN AN

609
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
HOUR WITH MORE INFORMATION.

610
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
THEY DID THAT UNTIL 8:00 P.M.

611
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
LAST NIGHT, 8:00 P.M. EASTERN

612
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
THEY SAID WE'LL LET YOU, THE

613
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
MEDIA, TAKE A BREAK AND GET

614
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
REST.

615
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
WE ARE GOING TO LET OUR PEOPLE

616
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
GET SOME REST BUT THE CRIME

617
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
SCENES WERE NOT GOING TO BE,

618
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
THERE'S GOING TO BE NO REST.

619
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER WAS AT THE

620
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
SCHOOL ALL NIGHT.

621
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
THEY WERE PROCESSING THE BODIES,

622
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
BUT THE TERRIBLE INCIDENT OF THE

623
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
PARENTS WHO KNEW THEIR KIDS

624
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
DIDN'T COME HOME, THEY WERE NOT

625
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
ALLOWED INTO THE SCHOOL.

626
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
SO THEY HAD TENTATIVE

627
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
IDENTIFICATIONS ON ALL THE

628
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
BODIES AND THEN GOT POSITIVE

629
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
IDENTIFICATIONS FROM THE

630
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
PARENTS.
THEY WERE NOT GOING TO RELEASE

631
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
ANY NAMES UNTIL THEY HAD

632
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION ON

633
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
EVERYBODY.

634
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
NOW WHERE WE ARE, WE ARE AT

635
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
TREADWELL MEMORIAL PARK WITH A

636
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
SOCCER AND FOOTBALL FIELD AND A

637
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
BASEBALL DIAMOND NEXT TO IT.

638
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
THE SCHOOL IS OVER THERE.

639
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
THE AUTHORITIES MADE SURE TO

640
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
KNOW THERE WAS GLOBAL INTEREST

641
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
IN THIS STORY AND IMPORTANTLY,

642
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A STORY THAT

643
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
MOVES EVERYBODY.
AND THAT'S WHY THEY SET US UP

644
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
OVER HERE.
YOU'RE IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION

645
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
AT ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE THERE

646
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
WAS A VIGIL DOWNTOWN.

647
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THIS SMALL

648
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
TOWN, JOHN.

649
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY.

650
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
ONE OF THE VICTIMS WE KNOW ABOUT

651
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
WHAT YOU SAY THE PRINCIPAL OF

652
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
THE SCHOOL, DAWN HOCHSPRUNG

653
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
DESCRIBED AS A, QUOTE, TOUGH

654
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
LADY IN THE RIGHT SORT OF SENSE.

655
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
WORKING ON SCHOOL SECURITY, SHE

656
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
WAS IDOLIZED BAY LOT OF PEOPLE

657
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
IN THE COMMUNITY.

658
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
A 47-YEAR-OLD MOTHER OF TWO

659
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
DAUGHTERS, THREE STEP-DAUGHTERS.

660
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
WHEN HER LIFE CAME TO A TRAGIC

661
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
END IN THE SCHOOL THAT SHE WAS

662
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
AT SINCE 2010.

663
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
SHE HAD BEEN AN ADMINISTRATOR

664
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
FOR TEN YEARS.

665
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
PARENTS SAID SHE WAS CREATIVE

666
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
AND TALKED ABOUT THE FUN THINGS

667
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
THEY DID.

668
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I HEARD ABOUT DRESS-UP DAYS SHE

669
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
WAS LEADING.
SHE WAS ONE OF 15 EDUCATORS IN A

670
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
DOCTOR PROGRAM AT THE SAGE

671
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
COLLEGE HERE IN NEW YORK.

672
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
THE DEAN THERE, DR. LAURA QUIGLY

673
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
JOINS ME.

674
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
WHAT KIND OF IMPRESSION DID THIS

675
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
PRINCIPAL, DAWN HOCHSPRUNG, GIVE

676
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
TO YOU?
WHAT KIND OF IMPRESSION DID SHE

677
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
MAKE ON YOUR STUDENTS?

678
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
>> I MET HER FIRST OF ALL WHEN I

679
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
WELCOMED THE STUDENTS TO THE

680
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
CAMPUS LAST SUMMER.

681
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
OF THE 16 CANDIDATES ACCEPTED

682
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
INTO THE DOCTORATE PROGRAM THIS

683
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
YEAR, I REALLY HONESTLY HAVE TO

684
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
SAY SHE WAS THE ONE PERSON WHO

685
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
LEFT AN INDELIBLE MARK ON ME

686
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
BECAUSE I WAS SO IMPRESSED BY

687
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
HER COMMENTS, HER DEDICATION TO

688
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
HER SMALL COMMUNITY IN NEWTOWN,

689
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
CONNECTICUT.
HER FELLOW CLASSMATES WERE JUST

690
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
AMAZED SHE WAS TRAVELING FROM

691
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
CONNECTICUT UP TO THE CAPITOL

692
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
REGION OF NEW YORK TO PURSUE HER

693
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
DOCTORATE IN EDUCATIONAL

694
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
LEADERSHIP.

695
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
SHE SPOKE ABOUT HOW SHE TRULY

696
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
BELIEVED THAT HER ROLE IN

697
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
EDUCATION WAS TO CREATE SUCH

698
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
LEADERS OF THE ELEMENTARY

699
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
CHILDREN WITH WHOM SHE SERVED.

700
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
SHE HAD AN INFECTIOUS SMILE AND

701
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
SHE WAS ALWAYS SMILING.

702
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I THINK THAT'S A REASON WHY I

703
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
REMEMBER HER SO DEARLY.

704
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
>> Reporter: LORI, IT IS NOT

705
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
OFTEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE IN A TOWN,

706
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
PARENTS AND TEACHERS AND KIDS

707
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
TALK ABOUT A PRINCIPAL WITH SUCH

708
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
REVERENCE.

709
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
DID SHE SHARE ANYTHING ABOUT HER

710
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
SCHOOL AND STUDENTS BACK HERE IN

711
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
CONNECTICUT?
>> WELL, IN HER CLASSES I KNOW

712
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
IN TALKING WITH SOME OF HER

713
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
FELLOW STUDENTS AND WITH THE

714
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
PROFESSORS, SHE DID TALK ABOUT

715
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
HOW SHE TRULY DID BELIEVE IN

716
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

717
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
CHILDREN FELT SAFE, WHERE

718
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
CHILDREN TREATED EACH OTHER WITH

719
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
RESPECT, WHERE IT WAS AN

720
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
ENVIRONMENT THAT TRULY FELT

721
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
CARE.
AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE

722
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
TRAGIC IRONY OF THIS ENTIRE

723
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
SITUATION.

724
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000

THIS SITUATION?

BACK IN THE 1990s.

742
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
AS A PROFESSIONAL EDUCATOR THAT

743
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
WORKS WITH PARENTS, TEACHERS,

744
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
ADMINISTRATORS, LET ME FIRST ASK

745
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
YOU THIS, WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS

746
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
SHOULD WE BE ASKING IN THE FACE

747
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
OF THIS REPEATED SCHOOL

748
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
VIOLENCE?

749
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
>> WELL, I THINK WE HAVE TO SORT

750
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
OF ASK OURSELVES BEYOND THE

751
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT, FIRST OF

752
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
ALL, I REALLY DO BELIEVE IN OUR

753
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS.

754
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
OUR PROFESSIONALS ARE DEDICATED.

755
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
THEIR NUMBER ONE FOCUS IS THE

756
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
EDUCATION AND THE WELL-BEING OF

757
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
YOUNG CHILDREN.
BUT I THINK BEYOND THAT IN OUR

758
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
SOCIETY, I THINK MAYBE WE HAVE

759
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
TO QUESTION, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS

760
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
THE IMPACT OF MEDIA, WHAT'S THE

761
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA?

762
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
WHAT'S THE IMPACT OF THE LACK OF

763
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
APPROPRIATE GUN CONTROL LAWS?

764
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I HEAR YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT

765
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
AND WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT

766
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
THAT AFTER EVERY TRAGIC EVENT,

767
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
BUT WHERE IS THE ACTION AS A

768
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
RESULT OF ALL THIS TALK?

769
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
>> Reporter: LORI, THANK YOU SO

770
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
MUCH FOR JOINING US.

771
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT

772
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
NEED TO BE ASKED, THE

773
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN
IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD.

774
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
ALI?
>> Reporter: ALL RIGHT, JOHN, I

775
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
WANT TO BRING IN FORMER FBI

776
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR TOM FUENTES,

777
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
ALSO A CNN CONTRIBUTOR.

778
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
TOM, I WANT TO ASK YOU

779
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
SOMETHING, WE'LL BE HEARING FROM

780
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
THE POLICE, WE MAY OR MAY NOT

781
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
GET ALL OF THE NAMES OF THE

782
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
VICTIMS.
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WOULDN'T,

783
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
BUT LAST NIGHT YOU WOULD HAVE

784
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
KNOWN WHO ALL THE VICTIMS WERE.

785
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
THE PARENTS WOULD HAVE KNOWN,

786
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
OBVIOUSLY, THEIR PARENTS DIDN'T

787
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
COME HOME.
AND THERE ARE FOUR ADULTS.

788
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
EVERYBODY KNEW THAT.

789
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
THEY WILL NOT GIVE OUT THE

790
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
INFORMATION, THEY WILL NOT GIVE

791
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
OUT THE NAMES UNTIL EVERYBODY IS

792
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED.

793
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
TELL ME ABOUT THAT PROCESS.

794
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
THE BODIES STAYED IN THE SCHOOL

795
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
ALL NIGHT.

796
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

797
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
MORE ON THE PROCESS NOW IS

798
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
REALLY LOOKING AT THE MORE

799
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
HORRIFIC ASPECT OF THIS, WHERE

800
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
WERE THE CHILDREN AS THEY WERE

801
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
BEING SHOT?
WHERE WAS THE SHOOTER?

802
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
HOW CLOSE WAS HE?

803
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
SO THAT'S PART OF THE QUESTION

804
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
OF WHY THE BODIES HAVE BEEN IN

805
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
THE BUILDING ALL NIGHT WHILE

806
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
THEY WERE WORKING ON THIS.

807
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
>> Reporter: AND THEY WOULD

808
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
TYPICALLY NOT LET THE PARENT

809
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
INTO AN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE.

810
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
WHEN THEY SAY THEY NEED POSITIVE

811
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
IDENTITIES TO THE BODIES, WHAT

812
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
DOES THAT MEAN.

813
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
>> THEY DON'T WANT PARENTS

814
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
CONTAMINATING THE SCENE AND

815
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
BEING OVERCOME WITH GRIEF AND

816
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
GRABBING THEIR CHILDREN OR

817
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
HAVING A WORSE SITUATION INSIDE

818
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
THE SCHOOL, INSIDE THE CRIME

819
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
SCENE.

820
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
SO THAT WOULD BE THE REASON FOR

821
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
THE SECURITY AS THEY ARE TRYING

822
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
TO METHODICALLY ENSURE THEY HAVE

823
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
FIGURED OUT EXACTLY WHAT

824
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
HAPPENED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL

825
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
CHILD, WHAT THE SHOOTER DID,

826
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
WHERE THE VICTIMS WERE AND THEN,

827
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
OF COURSE, THE IDENTIFICATION

828
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
PROCESS THAT GOES WITH THAT.

829
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
>> Reporter: TOM, THERE'S A

830
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
SECOND CRIME SCENE, I WAS THERE

831
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
LAST NIGHT, MARY SNOW IS THERE

832
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
NOW, THE HOME OF THE SHOOTER.

833
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
THEY CLOSED OFF THE ENTIRE ROAD

834
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
AND TOLD FAMILIES TO LEAVE AND

835
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
NOT COME BACK.

836
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
WHAT DO THEY DO IN A SCENE LIKE

837
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
THAT?
>> WELL N THAT SITUATION THEY

838
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
WEREN'T SURE IF BEFORE HE WENT

839
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
TO THE SCHOOL TO SHOOT WHETHER

840
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
HE HAD SET UP BOBBY TRAPS OR HAD

841
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
EXPLOSIVES OR MATERIAL AT THE

842
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
HOUSE.
THAT'S WHY THEY EVACUATED

843
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
NEIGHBORS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT

844
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
THERE WAS NOT SOME GREATER

845
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY THAT

846
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
WOULD HAVE COME FROM THAT HOUSE.

847
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
SO THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

848
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
THAT SCENE WAS SECURE.

849
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
AND THEN, OF COURSE, THEY GO IN

850
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
AND DETERMINE THAT THERE'S

851
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
ANOTHER BODY THERE, HIS MOTHER.

852
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
AND THEY HAVE TO PROCESS THAT.

853
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
SO THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE

854
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
THERE, BUT THEY HAVE TO BE,

855
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
AGAIN, VERY METHODICAL THAT

856
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
THERE WEREN'T HARMFUL MATERIALS

857
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
PLACED IN THERE TO AFFECT THE

858
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
NEIGHBORING HOUSES AND THE

859
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
INVESTIGATORS THEMSELVES AS THEY

860
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
ARE WORKING.
>> Reporter: TOM, THIS IS A

861
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
SMALL TOWN.

862
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
AS SOON AS THIS HAPPENED THEY

863
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
HAD A MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT.

864
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
DANBURY HAS A BIGGER POLICE

865
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
FORCE AND STATE POLICE WERE IN

866
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
HERE.
JOHN BERMAN SAID THE AUTHORITIES

867
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
DID A FANTASTIC JOB OF

868
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
SHEPHERDING EVERYBODY AND GIVING

869
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
A GREAT INFORMATION FLOW, BUT

870
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
ULTIMATELY THEY ARE MAYBE

871
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
TRAINED FOR IT BUT HAVE HAD NO

872
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
EXPERIENCE WITH THIS.
ONE HOMICIDE IN THIS TOWN IN TEN

873
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
YEARS, WHAT IS IT LIKE FOR

874
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
POLICE IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT

875
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
WHO DON'T DEAL WITH THESE

876
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
SITUATIONS ON A REGULAR BASIS?

877
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
WHEN THEY GET THE CALLS, THE 911

878
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
DISPATCH CALLS THAT TELLS THEM

879
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
THERE'S A SHOOTING IN A SCHOOL

880
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
ON LOCKDOWN AND THEY ARE HEARING

881
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
GUNFIRE?
>> IT APPEARS IN THIS CASE THE

882
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
POLICE ACTION WAS EXCEPTIONALLY

883
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
WELL COORDINATED AND WELL

884
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
EXECUTED.
THEY WENT TO THE SCENE AND

885
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY HAD MORE

886
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
SHOOTERS.
HAY HAD TO NOT ONLY SECURE THE

887
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
PREMESIS BUT GO THROUGHOUT THE

888
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
COMMUNITY.

889
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
KIDS RAN OUT OF THE SCHOOL WITH

890
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
NO TELLING WHERE THEY RAN TO.

891
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL

892
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
SHOOTERS THAT MAY HAVE RUN INTO

893
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
THE WOODED AREA SURROUNDING THE

894
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
SCHOOL, SO THE POLICE HAD AN

895
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
OVERWHELMING TASK FROM THE FIRST

896
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
MINUTE OF THIS INCIDENT TO

897
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
REALLY EVEN CONTINUE WITH NOW.
SO IN THIS CASE THEY DEFERRED TO

898
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE WHO

899
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
TOOK COMMAND OF THE SITUATION

900
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
AND ALL THE OTHER AGENCIES THAT

901
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
ARE WORKING HERE ARE UNDER THAT

902
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
COMMAND AND PROVIDING ASSISTANCE

903
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
TO THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE.

904
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
AND THAT INCLUDES THE FEDERAL

905
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
AGENCIES, THE FBI, ATF, ANY

906
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
OTHER AGENCIES FROM THROUGHOUT

907
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
THE STATE OR OTHER STATE THAT IS

908
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
CAME TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO

909
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
THEM.
NO ONE TOWN COULD HANDLE THE

910
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
SITUATION.
THE AMOUNT OF INVESTIGATIVE WORK

911
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
IN THIS SITUATION IS JUST

912
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
INCREDIBLE.

913
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
AND I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT

914
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
YOU CAN'T DO IT BY YOURSELF.

915
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
NO ONE AGENCY COULD DO IT.

916
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
THEY NEED EVERYBODY'S HELP IN

917
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
THIS SITUATION.

918
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
>> Reporter: WE ARE EXPECTING TO

919
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
HEAR FROM THE CONNECTICUT STATE

920
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
POLICE MOMENTARILY.

921
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
THAT PRESS CONFERENCE WAS

922
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
SLALTED TO START A HALF HOUR

923
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
AGO.
THEY ARE RUNNING LATE.

924
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
THEY ARE HERE TRYING TO GATHER

925

YOU'RE WATCHING CNN.

THOSE ARE GOOD THINGS.

UPSTAIRS, THEY WILL SEE FANTASY.

939
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
NOT FANTASY... LOGISTICS.

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
UPS CAME IN, ANALYZED OUR SUPPLY
CHAIN, INVENTORY SYSTEMS...

941
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
UPS?
UPS.

942
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
NOT FANTASY?

943
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?

944
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I DID.

945
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
WE DID, BOB. WE DID.

946
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
GOT IT.

947
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I GET CONGESTED.

♪

955
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
>>> THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO

956
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
DIED TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

957
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

958
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
THE AGES OF 5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

>> THAT WAS A VISIBLY SHAKEN

960
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

961
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
A VISION OF PRESIDENT OBAMA NONE

962
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
OF US HAD SCENE.

963
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
A VISION OF A PRESIDENT MANY OF

964
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
US HAD NEVER SEEN.

965
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
THAT WAS JUST HOURS AFTER

966
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
YESTERD

967
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
YESTERDAY'S EASTER TERRIBLE

968
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
SHOOTING.
WE ARE EXPECTING A NEWS

969
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
CONFERENCE ANY MINUTE FROM THE

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE AND

971
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
WILL BRING THAT TO YOU THE

972
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
SECOND IT HAPPENS.

973
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
WE ARE TOLD THEY MAY RELEASE

974
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
SOME OF THE NAMES OF THE

975
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
VICTIMS, INCLUDING THE NAME OF

976
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
THE CHILDREN.

977
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
SOME 20 KIDS AGES 5 TO 10 KILLED

978
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
IN THIS AWFUL, AWFUL EVENT.

979
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I WANT TO GO TO WASHINGTON NOW

980
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
TO BRING IN CNN'S WHITE HOUSE

981
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
CORRESPONDENT BRIANNA KIELER.

982
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T JUST SPEAK

983
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
YESTERDAY, HE DEDICATED HIS

984
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
WEEKLY ADDRESS TO THE SHOOTING

985
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
VICTIMS.

986
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.

987
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
NO DOUBT HIS ADDRESS WOULD HAVE

988
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
BEEN ABOUT THE LOOMING TAX CUTS

989
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
HE'S WORKING WITH HOUSE

990
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
REPUBLICANS ON.
THAT WAS OCCUPYING WASHINGTON,

991
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
TAKING UP ALL THE OXYGEN HERE

992
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
UNTIL THIS SHOOTING HAPPENED.

993
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
OF COURSE, IT IS NOT SURPRISING,

994
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
THIS IS COMPLETELY SHIFTING THE

995
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
CONVERSATION IN WASHINGTON.

996
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA TALKING ABOUT

997
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
THE CONNECTICUT SHOOTING IN HIS

998
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
WEEKLY ADDRESS, TOUCHING AGAIN

999
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
ON A PERSONAL NOTE.

1000
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
HERE'S PART OF IT.

1001
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
>> THIS WEEKEND MICHELLE AND I

1002
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
ARE DOING WHAT EVERY PARENT IS

1003
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
DOING, HOLDING OUR CHILDREN AS

1004
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
CLOSE AS WE CAN AND REMINDING

1005
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
THEM HOW MUCH WE LOVE THEM.

1006
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

1007
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CAN'T DO THAT

1008
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
TODAY AND THEY NEED ALL OF US

1009
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
RIGHT NOW.

1010
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
BECAUSE WHILE NOTHING CAN TAKE
THE PLACE OF A LOST CHILD OR

1011
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
LOVED ONE, ALL OF US CAN EXTEND

1012
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
THE HAND TO THOSE IN NEED TO

1013
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
REMIND THEM THAT WE ARE THERE

1014
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
FOR THEM.

1015
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
THAT WE ARE PRAYING FOR THEM.

1016
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
AND THAT THE LOVE THEY FELT FOR

1017
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
THOSE THEY LOST ENDURES NOT JUST

1018
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
IN THEIR OWN MEMORIES BUT ALSO

1019
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND IN

1020
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
THEIR COUNTRY.

1021
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
>> Reporter: NOW PRESIDENT OBAMA

1022
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
HAD ALSO SAID IN HIS WEEKLY

1023
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
ADDRESS AS A NATION WE HAVE

1024
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
ENDURED FAR TOO MANY OF THESE

1025
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
TRAGEDIES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.

1026
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
JOHN, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

1027
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
REALLY STRIKES ME WHEN I THINK

1028
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
OF THE TRAGEDIES THAT PRESIDENT

1029
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
OBAMA PERSONALLY HAS HAD TO TALK

1030
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
ABOUT, TRY TO STRIKE THIS TONE

1031
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
OF UNITY ON, REMEMBER

1032
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
CONGRESSWOMAN GABBY GIFFORDS.

1033
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
HE WENT TO ARIZONA.

1034
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
AURORA, COLORADO, HE WENT TO

1035
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
COLORADO TO TRY TO DELIVER A

1036
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
MESSAGE OF UNITY.

1037
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
AND ALSO THAT TEMPLE SHOOTING IN

1038
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
WISCONSIN.
SO HE'S DEALT WITH A NUMBER OF

1039
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
THESE HORRIBLE INSTANCES.

1040
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
AND I THINK KIND OF WHEN YOU

1041
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
LOOK BACK IN THE LAST FEW YEARS,

1042
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
IT JUST STRIKES YOU HOW MANY AND

1043
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
HOW WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY OF

1044
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
THEM.
LY TELL YOU PRESIDENT OBAMA IS

1045
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
RECEIVING REGULAR UPDATES FROM

1046
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
HIS HOMELAND SECURITY TEAM AND

1047
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
HIS MAIN HOMELAND SECURITY

1048
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
ADVISER.

1049
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
HE'S ALSO IN TOUCH, OF COURSE,

1050
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
WITH STATE OFFICIALS IN

1051
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
CONNECTICUT GETTING THE VERY

1052
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
SLATEST ON WHAT'S HAPPENING

1053
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
THERE, JOHN.

1054
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
>> Reporter: BRIANNA, ONE OF THE

1055
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
THINGS HE MENTIONED IN HIS

1056
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
REMARKS YESTERDAY WAS THAT HE
HAD SO MANY OF THE TRAGIC EVENTS

1057
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
LIKE YOU SAID AND IT WAS TIME TO

1058
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
TAKE SOME TYPE OF MEANINGFUL

1059
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
ACTION.
THE WORDS WERE MEANINGFUL.

1060
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
AS THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS

1061
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANT BY

1062
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
THAT?
>> Reporter: THEY HAVEN'T.

1063
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
THIS WAS SOMETHING JAY CARNEY

1064
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
WAS PRESSED ON IN THE BRIEFING

1065
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
YESTERDAY WAS WHAT ABOUT GUN

1066
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
LEGISLATION?
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE

1067
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ABOUT IN

1068
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
LOOSE TERMS BUT HAS NOT PROPOSED

1069
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
SPECIFICS ON.

1070
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
PART OF THAT IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT

1071
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
CONGRESS, EVEN DEMOCRATS, THERE

1072
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
ISN'T A WILL TO PASS ANY SORT OF

1073
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION.

1074
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
IT IS AN ISSUE REALLY FALLING

1075
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
OFF THE LIST OF PRIORITIES OF

1076
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
THINGS TO DO.

1077
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
THIS WAS THE CASE IN HIS LAST

1078
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
TERM.

1079
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
THIS IS THE EXPECTATION IN THE

1080
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
NEXT TERM.

1081
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
AND IT'S UNCLEAR IF THIS

1082
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
SHOOTING WILL REALLY FURTHER

1083
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
THAT.

1084
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
WE HAVE SEEN AS I MENTIONED

1085
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
ALMOST THIS SORT OF LITANY OF

1086
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
THESE FORABLE TRAGEDIES, NONE OF

1087
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
WHICH HAVE PUSHED FORWARD ANY

1088
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
SORT OF GUN LEGISLATION IN

1089
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
RESPONSE TO THEM.

1090
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
SO THERE WILL BE A LOT OF

1091
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT RESPONDS TO THIS,

1092
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
JOHN, BUT AT THIS POINT IT IS

1093
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
UNCLEAR AND THERE REALLY AREN'T

1094
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
ANY SPECIFICS THERE ABOUT

1095
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
WHETHER SOMETHING NEW WOULD BE

1096
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
PROPOSED, MAY CONTINUING TO PUSH

1097
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
EXISTING LEGISLATION.

1098
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
WE JUST DON'T KNOW.

1099
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
>> Reporter: YEAH, HE USED THE

1100
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
WORDS MEANINGFUL ACTION

1101
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
YESTERDAY.
MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG A FIERCE

1102
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
GUN CONTROLLED A ADVOVATE ALSO

1103
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
MENTIONED IT IS TIME FOR ACTION.

1104
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
BEFORE I LET YOU GO, YOU

1105
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
MENTIONED THE NEGOTIATIONS FOR

1106
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
THE FISCAL CLIFF.

1107
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
WERE THE NEGOTIATIONS THERE?

1108
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
DOES HE HAVE TO JUGGLE THIS NOW

1109
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
OR HOW WILL HE JUGGLE THIS?

1110
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
IS THERE A SENSE OF WHAT WILL

1111
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
HAPPEN TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS THE

1112
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
NEXT FEW DAYS?

1113
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
>> Reporter: IT IS UNCLEAR AT

1114
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
THIS POINT.

1115
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I WILL TELL YOU, SPEAKING TO

1116
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
AIDES CLOSE TO PRESIDENT OBAMA

1117
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
YESTERDAY, THIS SHOOTING HAS

1118
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
VERY MUCH OCCUPIED HIS TIME.

1119
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
THAT'S NOT REALLY A SURPRISE,

1120
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT.

1121
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
HE'S VERY MUCH TURNED HIS

1122
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
ATTENTION TO THIS.

1123
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
THAT COULD CHANGE IN THE NEXT

1124
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
COUPLE OF DAYS AND ALSO IT IS

1125
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
NOT JUST PRESIDENT OBAMA

1126
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
INVOLVED WITH THE SPEAKER, WITH

1127
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER IN THE

1128
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
DISCUSSIONS.
THERE ARE THINGS GOING ON AT THE

1129
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
STAFF LEVEL.
THOSE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE

1130
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
FISCAL CLIFF CAN CONTINUE BUT

1131
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
CERTAINLY AT LEAST PUBLICLY

1132
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL BE FOCUSING

1133
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
ON THE SHOOTING IN CONNECTICUT.

1134
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.
LEADING THE NATION IN GRIEVING

1135
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
HORRIBLY TO THIS GUNMAN.

1146

YOUNGER BROTHER OF A BOY THAT

1164
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
WAS KILLED.
IT WAS 9:30 AND THIS HAPPENED

1165
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
SHORTLY BEFORE 10:00.

1166
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
IT WAS CRAZY.

1167
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
>> Reporter: FOR ANYONE WHO

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
FEELS AFFECTED --

>> ANYONE IN THE TOWN IS REALLY

1170
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
DEVASTATED BY THIS THING.
IT IS SUCH A SMALL TOWN AND I

1171
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
FEEL LIKE THIS IS GOING TO BRING

1172
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
EVERYONE TOGETHER EVEN THOUGH IT
IS SUCH A TRAGEDY.

1173
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
>> Reporter: -- AND FOR ALL

1174
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
THOSE WHO GRIEVE FOR LIVES LOST

1175
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
TOO YOUNG.

1176
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
>> LIKE THE PASTOR NOW SAID, WE

1177
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
HAVE 20 NEW ANGELS IN OUR TOWN

1178
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
WATCHING OVER US.

1179
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
>> Reporter: WE ARE IN NEWTOWN,

1180
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
CONNECTICUT.

1181
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
WE ARE AWAITING A NEWS

1182
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
CONFERENCE FROM CONNECTICUT

1183
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000

1184
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
INVESTIGATION TO UPDATE US ON

1185
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
MAYBE TO EXPECT SOME NAMES OF

1186
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
THE VICTIMS HERE IN NEWTOWN.

1187
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
THAT NEWS CONFERENCE HAS NOT

1188
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
STARTED BUT WE'LL BRING IT TO

1189
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
YOU THE MINUTE, THE MINUTE, THE

1190
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
SECOND IT BEGINS.
IN THE MEANTIME, LET'S GO OVER

1191
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
TO ALI VELSHI IN NEWTOWN.

1192
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
>> Reporter: JOHN, IT PROMISES

1193
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
TO START, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO

1194
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
START A HALF HOUR AGO.

1195
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
WE HAVE SEEN THE STATE POLICE

1196
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
OFFICIALS WHO ARE HERE WHO

1197
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
SHOULD BE LEADING THIS NEWS

1198
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
CONFERENCE.
AS YOU HAVE POINTED OUT, THE

1199
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
POLICE OFFICIALS, THE

1200
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
AUTHORITIES HERE HAVE BEEN VERY,

1201
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
VERY GOOD AT GIVING OUT

1202
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
INFORMATION.

1203
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
THEY ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN

1204
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
GIVING OUT ACCURATE INFORMATION.

1205
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
MANY TIMES WE FIND IN EVENTS

1206
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
LIKE THIS THERE'S A PUSH TO GET

1207
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
INFORMATION OUT.

1208
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
LOOK, IT'S BEEN 23 HOURS SINCE

1209
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
THIS HAPPENED AND ALREADY THERE

1210
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
HAVE BEEN SEVERAL STORIES THAT

1211
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
WERE THOUGHT TO BE TRUE THAT

1212
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
HAVE NOT TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE.

1213
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I WANT TO BRING IN MIKE BROOKS

1214
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
IN ATLANTA.

1215
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
HLN'S LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST.

1216
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
MIKE, WE HAVE COVERED A NUMBER

1217
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
OF THESE SORTS OF THINGS IN THE

1218
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
PAST, PROBABLY NONE AS TRAGIC AS

1219
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
THIS.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SHOOTER,

1220
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
ADAM LANZA, WHO IS ALLEGED TO

1221
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
HAVE TAKEN HIS MOTHER'S LIFE AT

1222
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
THEIR HOME TWO-AND-A-HALF MILES

1223
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
FROM HERE AND THEN GOING TO THE

1224
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
SCHOOL.

1225
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
HE HAD TWO GUNS ON THEM AND ONE

1226
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC BUSHMASTER IN THE

1227
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
CAR APPARENTLY LICENSED TO HIS

1228
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
MOTHER, BUT APPARENTLY HE HAD

1229
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
ACCESS TO AT LEAST FIVE GUNS

1230
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
ACCORDING TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT

1231
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
OFFICIAL WITH DIRECT KNOWLEDGE

1232
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
OF THE INVESTIGATION.

1233
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
HE'S ASKED FOR ANONYMITY BECAUSE

1234
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
OF THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION.

1235
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?

1236
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
HE WAS FOUND DEAD IN THE

1237
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
CLASSROOM WITH TWO FIREARMS, A

1238
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
GLR

1239
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
GLOCK AND A SIG SAUER.

1240
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
THEY ARE GUNS POPULAR AMONG LAW

1241
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
ENFORCEMENT.

1242
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
>> THEY ARE.

1243
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I HAD A SIG SAUER AS MY SERVICE

1244
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
WEAPON.
AND I ALSO HAD A GLOCK.

1245
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
THEY ARE HIGH-QUALITY

1246
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC HANDGUNS.

1247
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
AGAIN, THEY BELONGED TO HIS

1248
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
MOTHER.

1249
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
BUT HE HAD APPARENTLY DIRECT

1250
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
ACCESS TO THESE GUNS.

1251
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
SO, AND HE APPARENTLY, MOST

1252
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
LIKELY, DID NOT HAVE A

1253
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
BACKGROUND CHECK, BUT WE DON'T

1254
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
KNOW WHAT TRANSPIRED INSIDE THAT

1255
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
HOUSE BEFORE HE CAME TO THAT

1256
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
SCHOOL AND WENT ON A RAMPAGE.

1257
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT THE

1258
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
PICTURES OF THESE WEAPONS RIGHT

1259
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
NOW.

1260
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
WE SAW THE GLOCK ON THE UPPER

1261
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
LEFT.
WE SAW THE SIG SAUER.

1262
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CALIBER THE

1263
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
GUNS WERE.

1264
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
THESE ARE EXAMPLES.

1265
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
WE DON'T KNOW IFS AFTER A .9

1266
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
MILLIMETER AND WE DON'T KNOW

1267
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
WHAT KIND OF MODEL OF A

1268
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
BUSHMASTER IT IS.

1269
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
IT IS AN AR-15 WEAPON THAT FIRES

1270
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
A CARTRIDGE BASICALLY LIKE THE

1271
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
MILITARY USES.

1272
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
WHY WOULD ANYONE HAVE THIS GUN?

1273
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DO

1274
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
OWN WEAPONS LIKE THIS FOR TARGET

1275
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
SHOOTING.

1276
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
SOME PEOPLE, EVEN SOME HUNT WITH

1277
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
THEM.

1278
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM OUT

1279
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
THERE AND PEOPLE DO USE THEM FOR

1280
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
TARGET PRACTICE.

1281
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
AND ALSO SELF-DEFENSE.

1282
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
>> Reporter: UNDER WHAT

1283
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD YOU BE USING

1284
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
A BUSHMASTER FOR SELF-DEFENSE?

1285
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
>> WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL

1644
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
THAT'S LOGISTICS.

1645
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
THAT'S MARGIN.

1646
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
FIND OUT WHAT ELSE UPS KNOWS.

1647
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I'LL DO THAT.

1648
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
YOU'RE ON A ROLL.

1649
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
THAT'S FUNNY.

1650
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I WASN'T BEING FUNNY, BOB.

1651
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I KNOW.

1652
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
>>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE.

1653
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
JOHN BERMAN HERE IN NEWTOWN,

1654
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
CONNECTICUT.

1655
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
WHERE WE ARE AWAITING A NEWS

1656
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
CONFERENCE FROM THE CONNECTICUT

1657
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
STATE POLICE WHO HAVE BEEN SO

1658
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
CONSCIENTIOUS IN UPDATING US ON

1659
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
THE SITUATION HERE.

1660
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
THE INVESTIGATION, THEY WERE

1661
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
DOING IT EVERY HOUR YESTERDAY

1662
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
AFTERNOON AND INTO THE EVENING.
AND THEY SCHEDULED A NEWS

1663
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
CONFERENCE FOR THIS MORNING AS

1664
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,000
WELL.
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BEGIN ONE

1665
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
HOUR AGO.
IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN DELAYED.

1666
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
WE HAVE SEEN OFFICIALS THERE

1667
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
MILLING ABOUT SO HOPEFULLY IT
WILL GET GOING SOON.

1668
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
THEY HAVE BEEN GOOD ABOUT GIVING
US ACCURATE INFORMATION.

1669
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
PERHAPS THEY ARE GETTING THE

1670
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
LAST BIT OF INFORMATION TOGETHER

1671
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
NOW.
WE'LL BRING YOU THE NEWS

1672
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
CONFERENCE THE MINUTE IT BEGINS.

1673
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
IN THE MEANTIME, CNN LEGAL

1674
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
CONTRIBUTOR PAUL KALLEN IS LIVE

1675
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
FROM NEW YORK, A CRIMINAL

1676
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
DEFENSE ATTORNEY, A FORMER NEW

1677
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
YORK CITY HOMICIDE PROSECUTOR.

1678
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
PAUL, RIGHT NOW THIS MORNING,

1679
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
OVERNIGHT, EVERYONE TALKING

1680
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL.

1681
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
BUT IF THE SUSPECT GOT THESE

1682
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
GUNS FROM HIS MOTHER WHO WE

1683
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
BELIEVE HE DID, AND THEY WERE

1684
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
LEGALLY REGISTERED, WOULD

1685
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
STRONGER GUN CONTROL LAWS HAVE

1686
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
MADE ANY DIFFERENCE?

1687
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
>> I DON'T THINK STRONGER GUN

1688
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
CONTROL LAWS WOULD MAKE A

1689
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
DIFFERENCE IN THIS CASE BASED ON

1690
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
WHAT WE KNOW.

1691
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
CONNECTICUT HAS RELATIVELY TOUGH

1692
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
GUN LAWS.

1693
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
YOU NEED A PERMIT TO BUY A

1694
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
HANDGUN AND IN ORDER TO GET THE

1695
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
HANDGUN YOU HAVE TO DO A

1696
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
BACKGROUND CHECK, YOU NEED A

1697
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
FINGERPRINT AND THE WOMAN KEPT

1698
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
THE GUNS IN THE HOUSE.

1699
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
IT IS HARD TO GET A CARRY PERMIT

1700
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THE

1701
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
CARRY PERMIT.
AND THE MILITARY-STYLE WEAPON,

1702
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
FRANKLY, IN MOST STATES WOULD BE

1703
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
LEGAL BECAUSE IT IS CONSIDERED

1704
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
TO BE A RIFLE OR SHOTGUN.

1705
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
IT IS NOT AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON.
PEOPLE CALL THOSE AUTOMATIC

1706
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
WEAPONS BUT AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON

1707
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
WHEN YOU PULL THE TRIGGER YOU

1708
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
GET MACHINE FIRING OF THE

1709
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
BULLETS AS OPPOSED TO ONE BULLET

1710
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
WERE PULL, WHICH MAKES IT A

1711
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC AND LEGAL.

1712
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
SO I THINK IN THE END UNLESS YOU

1713
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
BANNED ALL GUNS COMPLETELY, YOU

1714
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
COULDN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT ON A

1715
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS.

1716
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
AND IN MOST STATES IN

1717
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
CONNECTICUT, HUNTING WEAPONS ARE

1718
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
PERMITTED.

1719
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS WILL

1720
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
AFFECT THE GUN CONTROL

1721
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
LEGISLATION THAT'S OUT THERE, AT

1722
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
LEAST IN CONNECTICUT.

1723
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
>> Reporter: ALL RIGHT.

1732
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
GOOD MORNING, SOLEDAD.

1733
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000

LET ME TELL YOU WHERE I AM RIGHT

SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS.

1776
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
A QUESTION WE MAY NOT KNOW IS

1777
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
WHY WOULD SOMEONE ATTACK AN

1778
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

1779
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
WHY ULTIMATELY WOULD THEY KILL

1780
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
26 PEOPLE?
WE KNOW LAST NIGHT THE COMMUNITY

01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
AND COMMAND AREA WITHIN THE

1824
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,000
SANDY HOOK SCHOOL PARKING AREA?

1825
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
>> Reporter: YOU CAN HEAR THE

1826
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
CHAOS AND JUST HOW QUICKLY THIS

1827
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
DISASTER GREW AS THEY REALIZED

1828
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
THE SCOPE OF THE INJURIES AND

1829
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD

1830
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
BEEN INJURED AND KILLED.

1831
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
NOW, WE ARE JUST ABOUT 90

1832
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
MINUTES NORTH OF NEW YORK CITY

1833
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
AND NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, IS

1834
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
CONSIDERED TO BE A VERY SAFE

1835
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
COMMUNITY.
THERE HAS ONLY BEEN ONE HOMICIDE

1836
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
REPORTED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS

1837
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
IN THIS COMMUNITY, BUT OF

1838
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
COURSE, NOW UNFORTUNATELY

1839
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
NEWTOWN'S NAME IS SYNONYMOUS

1840
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
WITH COLUMBINE AND BLACKSBURG,

1841
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
VIRGINIA, BECAUSE OF THE MASS

1842
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
SHOOTING HERE.

1843
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
POLICE IDENTIFIED THIS SHOOTER

1844
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
AS 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM LANZA.

1845
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
WE ARE ONLY NOW STARTING TO GET

1846
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
A PICTURE OF WHO HE IS.

1847
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
WE'LL GO TO MARY SNOW FIRST AT

1848
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
LANZA'S HOME WHERE POLICE FOUND

1849
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
THE BODY OF HIS MOTHER.

1850
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
MARY, WHY DON'T YOU UPDATE US ON

1851
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
THE VERY LATEST WE KNOW ABOUT

1852
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER IN THIS

1853
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
CASE.
>> Reporter: SOLEDAD, IT IS

1854
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
BELIEVED THAT HE LIVED HERE WITH

1855
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
HIS MOTHER.

1856
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
HE CAN'T SEE THE HOME BEHIND ME

1857
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
WHERE THE ROAD BLOCKED OFF BY

1858
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
POLICE.

1859
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
THIS WAS AN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE

1860
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
YESTERDAY WHERE POLICE FOUND THE

1861
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
BODY OF NANCY LANZA IN THAT HOME

1862
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
AND RESIDENTS WERE EVACUATED

1863
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
FROM THEIR HOMES.

1864
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
WE ARE TOLD INVESTIGATORS HAVE

1865
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
BEEN ASKING THEM FOR ANY

1866
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
INFORMATION THAT THEY HAD PIECED

1867
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
TO THE WHAT THEY CAN ABOUT THIS

1868
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
SUSPECT.
AND WHAT SOME OF THE THINGS WE

1869
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
ARE LEARNING ABOUT HIM, ONE

1870
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
NEIGHBOR DESCRIBED HIM AS

1871
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
TROUBLED.

1872
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
BUT IN HIS EARLIER YEARS, FORMER

1873
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
CLASSMATES DESCRIBE HIM AS

1874
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
SOMEONE WHO WAS VERY BRIGHT,

1875
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
VERY QUIET, KEPT TO HIMSELF.

1876
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
AND ACCORDING TO WHAT ONE WOMAN

1877
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
WHO WAS HERE YESTERDAY, A FORMER

1878
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
BUS DRIVER SAW, NOTHING THAT

1879
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
REALLY STOOD OUT.

1880
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
>> SOME OF THE OTHER RESIDENTS,

1881
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
HE HIMSELF WAS A LITTLE FIDGETY,

1882
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
A LITTLE UNEASY IF YOU WERE TO

1883
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
LOOK AT HIM.

1884
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I THINK HE WAS JUST SOCIALLY NOT

1885
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
INTO GOING OUT THERE AND MAKING

1886
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
FRIENDS AS EVERYONE WAS REALLY

1887
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
DOING IN ALMOSTRY SCHOOL AND

1888
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
MIDDLE SCHOOL.
HE PREFERRED TO STAY TO HIMSELF.

1889
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
>> Reporter: THAT WAS A FORMER

1890
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
CLASSMATE WHO SPOKE TO CNN LAST

1891
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
NIGHT.

1892
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
AND SUSAN CANDIOTTI SPOKE WITH A

1893
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL WHO

1894
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
SAID IN PIECES TOGETHER THIS

1895
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
INFORMATION, ONE THING THEY DID

1896
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
LEARN FROM A FAMILY MEMBER WHO

1897
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
TOLD INVESTIGATORS, HE HAD A

1898
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
FORM OF AUTISM.

1899
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
SOLEDAD?
>> Reporter: WE ARE GOING TO

1900
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
TALK MORE ABOUT THAT, MARY, WITH

1901
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
SANJAY GUPTA.

1902
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
BECAUSE AS FAR AS I KNOW, THERE

1903
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
ARE NO STUDIES AT ALL THAT LINK

1904
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
ANY FORM OF AUTISM WITH VIOLENT

1905
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
ACTS.
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE'LL TALK

1906
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
TO OUR MEDICAL UNIT ABOUT LATER

1907
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
THIS MORNING.

1908
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE, MARY

1909
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
SNOW, FOR US THIS MORNING.

1910
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
OF COURSE, THIS IS A PARENT'S

1911
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
WORST NIGHTMARE TO SEND YOUR

1912
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
CHILDREN OFF TO SCHOOL AND THEN

1913
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
YOU HAVE NO EXPECTATIONS THAT

1914
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
JUST A FEW HOURS LATER YOU ARE

1915
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
GOING TO GET A ROBOCALL MESSAGE

1916
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
SAYING THE SCHOOL IS IN

1917
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
LOCKDOWN.

1918
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
IT HAD TO BE TERRIFYING FOR THE

1919
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
PARENTS.
I WANT TO TALK TO LAURA PHELPS

1920
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
AND HER HUSBAND NICK.

1921
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
THEY HAVE TWO CHILDREN IN THE

1922
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
SCHOOL.
A FIRST GRADER AND A THIRD

1923
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
GRADER, DID YOU GET A ROBOCALL.

1924
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
IS THAT HOW YOU WERE FIRST

1925
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
NOTIFIED TO COME BACK TO THE

1926
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
SCHOOL?
>> I DID.

1927
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
THE FIRST CALL WE GOT WAS THAT

1928
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
CALL.
AND IT WAS, THERE'S BEEN A

1929
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
SHOOTING AND THE CHILDREN ARE IN

1930
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
LOCKDOWN.
>> Reporter: WHAT DID YOU DO?

1931
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
>> WE TURNED ON THE NEWS, WE

1932
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
CALLED FRIENDS AND WE HADN'T

1933
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
HEARD ANYTHING.

1934
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL ON THE TV MY

1935
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,000
SON CAME RUNNING AND SAID, IT'S

1936
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

1937
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
>> Reporter: THAT'S WHEN YOU

1938
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
REALIZED IT WAS YOUR ELEMENTARY

1939
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
SCHOOL.

1940
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
>> WE WERE HOPING IT WAS NOT ONE

1941
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
OF OUR SCHOOLS, IT WAS JUST A

1942
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
PRECAUTION.
MAYBE IT WASN'T A REAL SHOOTING.

1943
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
MAYBE JUST THINKING THIS WAS A

1944
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
REAL PRECAUTION.

1945
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
AND TO HEAR THAT IT WAS SANDY

1946
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
HOOK WAS CERTAINLY DEVASTATING.

1947
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
>> Reporter: IT HAS TO BE

1948
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
HORRIBLE.

1949
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
SO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A FIRST

1950
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
GRADER AND A THIRD GRADER IN

1951
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
THAT SCHOOL, DID YOU RUN TO THE

1952
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
SCHOOL RIGHT AWAY?

1953
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I MEAN, I WOULD HAVE RUN TO THE

1954
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
SCHOOL?
>> RIGHT.

1955
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
MY HUSBAND, HIS FIRST REACTION

1956
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
WAS LET'S GET TO THE SCHOOL.
MY FIRST REACTION WAS LET'S LET

1957
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
THE POLICE DO THE WORK, LET'S GO

1958
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
TO THE CHURCH.

1959
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
WE RAN TO THE CHURCH AND THEY

1960
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
WERE IN LOCKDOWN.

1961
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
SO WE TRIED TO GET BACK TO THE

1962
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
SCHOOL AND THAT'S WHEN WE SAW

1963
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
AMBULANCE AFTER AMBULANCE AND I

1964
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
THOUGHT, AT THAT TIME WE HAD

1965
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
HEARD POSSIBLY A TEACHER WAS

1966
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
SHOT.
AND I LOOKED AT THE AMBULANCES

1967
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
AND SAID TO MY HUSBAND, THIS

1968
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
ISN'T ONE PERSON.

1969
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
>> Reporter: TOO MANY

1970
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
AMBULANCES.
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING I

1971
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
THOUGHT WAS TOO MANY AMBULANCES.

1972
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
>> TOO MANY.

1973
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
>> Reporter: SO I KNOW YOUR SON

1974
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
WHO IS A FIRST GRADER, WHICH

1975
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
MAKES HIM 7 YEARS OLD, ROUGHLY?

1976
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
HE WAS IN THE ROOM VERY CLOSE TO

1977
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE

1978
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
SHOOTINGS HAPPENED.

1979
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
>> HE WAS ONE TO TWO CLASSROOMS

1980
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
AWAY.

1981
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
>> Reporter: SO WHAT HAS HE TOLD

1982
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
YOU SO FAR?

1983
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
>> HE TOLD US THAT THEY WERE

1984
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
LOOKING AT THE SMART BOARD AND

1985
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
SOMETHING WENT WRONG, SO THE

1986
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
TEACHER HAD THEM ALL SIT IN

1987
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
THEIR CUBBIES.

1988
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
AND THEY READ BOOKS IN THEIR

1989
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
CUBBIES UNTIL POLICEMEN CAME.

1990
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
AND HE SAID THE POLICEMEN SAID

1991
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
JUST WALK VERY FAST.

1992
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
AND HE SAID HE SAW SOME PEOPLE

1993
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,000
ON THE FLOOR, SOMEONE ON THE

1994
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
FLOOR, SLEEPING.

1995
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
>> Reporter: SO WHEN HE RECOUNTS

1996
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
THE STORY TO YOU, IS HE UPSET?

1997
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
IS HE EMOTIONAL?

1998
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
OR DO YOU THINK HE'S SO LITTLE,

1999
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
6, HE DOESN'T QUITE PROCESS THE

2000
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
SLEEPING OR HIS CLASSMATES?

2001
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
>> WHEN I FIRST FOUND HIM IN THE

2002
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
FIREHOUSE WHERE THEY HAD BROUGHT

2003
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
THE CHILDREN, HE WAS IN VERY

2004
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
GOOD SPIRITS, VERY TALKATIVE.

2005
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
WHEN WE BROUGHT HIM AWAY FROM

2006
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
THE FIREHOUSE, HE WAS VERY

2007
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
TALKATIVE.
UNLIKE MY DAUGHTER, WHO WAS VERY

2008
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
QUIET.
HE WAS VERY UPBEAT.

2009
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I DON'T THINK IT REALLY,

2010
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
WHATEVER THE TEACHER DID, SHE

2011
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
RELAXED THEM TO THE POINT THAT

2012
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
THEY WERE UNAWARE OF WHAT WAS

2013
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
GOING ON, WOULD BE MY

2014
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
INTERPRETATION OF HIS REACTION.

2015
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
>> Reporter: OR HOW MUCH DANGER

2016
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
THEY WERE IN.

2017
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

2018
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
>> Reporter: SHE HAD THEM HIDE

2019
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
IN THEIR CUBBIES FOR AS MUCH

2020
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
PROTECTION YOU COULD HAVE, WHICH

2021
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
IS NOT MUCH IN A CUB BY.

2022
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
>> WE REALIZED WHAT SHE PROBABLY

2023
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
DID WAS SHE TOLD THEM THAT THE

2024
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
MAGIC BOARD HAD MALFUNCTIONED

2025
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
AND THAT WAS THE REASON THEY

2026
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,000
NEEDED TO READ BOOKS IN THEIR

2027
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
CUBBIE.
SHE READ TO THEM APPARENTLY

2028
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
WHILE THIS WAS ALL GOING ON.

2029
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
>> Reporter: THERE ARE SO MANY

2030
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
STORIES OF THE TEACHERS BEING SO

2031
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
HEROIC AND KEEPING SUCH A COOL

2032
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
HEAD WHEN OBVIOUSLY EVERYTHING

2033
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
WRONG IS GOING ON AROUND THEM.

2034
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
PEOPLE DESCRIBE THE SHOOTING,

2035
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
HEAR SCREAMING, AND THEIR JOB IS

2036
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
TO KEEP A BUNCH OF SMALL

2037
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
CHILDREN UNAWARE OF HOW BAD IT

2038
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
REALLY IS.

2039
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
THEY ARE REALLY TRUE HEROES.

2040
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
>> THEY ARE SUPERHEROES.

2041
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
WHEN WE WENT DOWN TO THE

2042
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
FIREHOUSE TO GET OUR CHILDREN,

2043
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
WE WERE UNAWARE OF THE REAL

2044
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
TRAGEDY AT HAND.
I DID NOT THINK CHILDREN WERE

2045
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
INVOLVED.

2046
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I THOUGHT THIS WAS ISOLATED, A

2047
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
COUPLE TEACHERS, MAYBE EVEN JUST

2048
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
ONE.

2049
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
SO WHEN WE GOT OUR CHILDREN AND

2050
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I SAW MY SON'S TEACHER, THEY

2051
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
WERE LIKE GHOSTS, BUT THEY WERE

2052
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
INCREDIBLY COMPOSED.

2053
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
THEY HAD THEIR SHEETS WITH THEM

2054
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
CHECKING OFF TO MAKE SURE EACH

2055
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
CHILD WENT WITH THEIR PARENT.

2056
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
THEY -- THEY DID EVERYTHING

2057
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
POSSIBLE TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN

2058
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
SAFE.

2059
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
EVERYTHING.

2060
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
AND I WISH I HAD KNOWN WHEN I

2061
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
LOOKED AT THEIR FACES JUST TO

2062
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
SAY, THANK YOU.

2063
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
BECAUSE I HAVE MY CHILDREN.

2064
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
>> Reporter: A LOT OF PEOPLE

2065
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
DON'T.

2066
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
>> THEY DON'T.
>> IF I COULD HAVE GONE BACK,

2067
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
LIKE MY WIFE SAID, WE HAD NO

2068
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
IDEA AT THE LEVEL OF WHAT

2069
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
HAPPENED IN THERE, THE RUMOR

2070
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
GOING AROUND WAS THAT THE

2071
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
PRINCIPAL WHO WAS A WONDERFUL,

2072
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, THE RUMOR WAS

2073
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
THAT SHE HAD BEEN, THAT SHE HAD

2074
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
BEEN KILLED.

2075
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
AND ALL THE PARENTS HOPED THIS

2076
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT, EVEN

2077
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
THOUGH THAT WAS A HORRIBLE LOSS

2078
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
OF LIFE.
WHEN I SAW THOSE TEACHERS, WHEN

2079
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I FOUND THE TWO CHILDREN, AND WE

2080
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
WERE DEVASTATED AND HEARTBROKEN

2081
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
FOR THE POOR FAMILIES WHO DID

2082
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
NOT HAVE THAT MOMENT IN THE

2083
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
FIREHOUSE OF FINDING THEIR

2084
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
CHILDREN.
WE CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE AND OUR

2085
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
PRAYERS, JUST THE ENTIRE

2086
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
COMMUNITY IS HEARTBROKEN.

2087
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
BUT WHEN I SAW THE TEACHERS AND

2088
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I LOCKED EYES WITH EACH OF THEM

2089
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
SEPARATELY, WHEN I FOUND THE TWO

2090
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
CHILDREN, IF I COULD GO BACK, I

2091
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
WOULD EMBRACE THEM.

2092
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY

2093
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
HAD GONE THROUGH.

2094
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
BUT IT WAS, IT WAS ACTUALLY

2095
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
HANDLED VERY WELL BECAUSE I

2096
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
CAN'T IMAGINE THE PANDEMONIUM

2097
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOING ON IN

2098
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
THE FIREHOUSE WITH THE PARENTS

2099
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
SEARCHING FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

2100
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
IF ANYBODY THERE HAD ANY IDEA

2101
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
THE LEVEL OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED

2102
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
YESTERDAY, PEOPLE JUST SIMPLY

2103
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
DIDN'T KNOW REALLY WHAT WAS

2104
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
GOING ON.

2105
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
THEY JUST KNEW THEIR CHILDREN

2106
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
HAS BEEN IN A DANGEROUS PLACE

2107
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
AND THOSE THAT MADE IT TO THE

2108
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
FIREHOUSE WERE, THANK GOD, SAFE.

2109
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
>> Reporter: WHAT WILL YOU TELL

2110
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
YOUR SON WHO IS A FIRST GRADER?

2111
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
WHAT WILL YOU TELL YOUR DAUGHTER

2112
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
WHO IS A THIRD GRADE HER?

2113
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
DO THEY HAVE ANY IDEA THE SCOOP

2114
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
OF HOW BAD IT IS?

2115
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
>> I THINK THEY DO MORE THAN

2116
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
THEY ARE LETTING ON.

2117
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
WE HAVE NOT SAID MUCH.

2118
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
THIS IS SHOCKING.

2119
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
SO THIS IS NEW TO US.

2120
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
AND WE ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO

2121
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
TALK TO COUNSELORS TODAY OVER AT

2122
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
THE REED SCHOOL.
WE ARE GOING TO LIVE AT OUR

2123
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
CHURCH, AT ST. ROSE, AND WE ARE

2124
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
JUST GOING TO LEARN WHAT TO SAY

2125
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
BEFORE WE SAY IT.

2126
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
IT IS REALLY TRICKY.

2127
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
AND FOR MY THIRD GRADER, LITTLE

2128
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
BITS AND PIECES ARE COMING OUT

2129
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
NOW.
>> Reporter: IT SOUNDS LIKE

2130
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
SHE'S NOT TALKING AS MUCH ABOUT

2131
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
IT.

2132
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
>> LITTLE THINGS ARE COMING OUT

2133
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
NOW WHERE SHE HEARD A LOT.

2134
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
THEY ALL HEARD AND SAW THINGS

2135
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
THAT OUR CHILDREN SHOULD NOT

2136
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
HEAR OR SEE.

2137
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
AND SO WE JUST, WE KNOW THAT IT

2138
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
WAS A BAD MAN, AND WE JUST SAID

2139
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
WE ARE COMING TO TALK TO PEOPLE

2140
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
AND THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT

2141
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
HAPPENED AT SANDY HOOK.

2142
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
THEY DON'T KNOW, THEY DON'T KNOW

2143
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
THAT THEY HAVE LOST THEIR

2144
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
FRIENDS AND THEIR PRINCIPAL.

2145
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
>> IT'S BECOME APPARENT THAT OUR

2146
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
6-YEAR-OLD HAS LOST CLOSE

2147
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
FRIENDS.
AND HE'S VERY UNAWARE OF THAT

2148
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
RIGHT NOW.
WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXACTLY

2149
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
APPROACH IT WITH HIM AT THIS

2150
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
POINT.

2151
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
WE ARE JUST KIND OF GUARDING HIM

2152
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
FROM THE TV.
WHEN THEY FELL ASLEEP LAST NIGHT

2153
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
AND THE EXPERTS WOULD COME ON

2154
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
THE TV TO DISCUSS HOW YOU TALK

2155
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
TO YOUR CHILDREN, WE WERE VERY

2156
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
ATTENTIVE LIKE, OH, LET'S LISTEN

2157
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
FOR, LET'S WATCH THIS.

2158
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
AND WE REALIZED WATCHING IT HAD

2159
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
NOTHING TO DO WITH US.

2160
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
IT HAD EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE

2161
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
REST OF THE COUNTRY WATCHING IT.

2162
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
BUT NOT THE PEOPLE THAT WERE

2163
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
INVOLVED AND THE CHILDREN THAT

2164
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
WERE ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THE

2165
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
SCHOOL.

2166
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

2167
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
REALIZE AS THIS GOES ON TO TAKE

2168
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
ADVANTAGE OF THE COUNSELING.

2169
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
>> Reporter: MANY PEOPLE, SO

2170
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
MANY PEOPLE HAVE SENT MESSAGES

2171
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
TO ME TO TELL PEOPLE LIKE YOU

2172
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST

2173
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
THEIR CHILDREN, JUST HOW SORRY

2174
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
THEY FEEL FOR THEM.

2175
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
>> I MEAN, YOUR HEART, THIS IS A

2176
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
FEELING THAT IS UNSPEAKABLE.

2177
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
IT IS LIKE REACHING INTO YOUR

2178
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
INSIDES AND PULLING THEM OUT.

2179
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I MEAN, WHEN THINGS HAPPEN TO

2180
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
YOUR CHILDREN AND TO OTHER

2181
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
PEOPLE'S CHILDREN, I CAN'T LOOK

2182
