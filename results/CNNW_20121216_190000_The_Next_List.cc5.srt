YOU KNOW THE FOCUS REALLY SEEMS

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
TO BE ON THE SCHOOL AT THIS

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
POINT.
WE'RE LEARNING NEW DETAILS, EVEN

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
FROM THE GOVERNOR OF

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
CONNECTICUT.
DAN MALLOY.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
HE CONFIRMED WHAT OUR SOURCES

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
HAD BEEN TELLING US, THAT THE

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
GUNMAN LITERALLY BLASTED, HE

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
SHOT HIS WAY INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SCHOOL

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
HAD SECURITY IN PLACE.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
THAT YOU HAD TO BE BUZZED IN AS

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
OF 9:30 TO GET INTO THIS SCHOOL.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
BECAUSE THE DOORS WERE LOCKED.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
INCLUDING SECURITY CAMERAS

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
INSIDE THE SCHOOL AS WELL.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
BUT ONCE AGAIN, WE'RE LEARNING

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
THAT HE LITERALLY SHOT HIS WAY

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
INTO THE SCHOOL.

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
FROM STATE POLICE, WE'RE ALSO

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
LEARNING THAT THEY DISCOVERED

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
FOUR WEAPONS AT THE SCHOOL, THEY

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
WERE FOUND AT THE SCHOOL.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
THREE IN THE CLASSROOM, ANOTHER

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
ONE WAS FOUND AT THE CRIME

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
SCENE.
AND AN ADDITIONAL THREE WEAPONS

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
ARE SOURCES SAY, WERE FOUND IN

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
THE HOME WHERE ADAM SHARED WITH

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
HIS MOTHER, NANCY.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
AS FOR OTHER DETAILS.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
ABOUT THE VICTIMS, THIS BECOMES

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
VERY HEARTBREAKING WHEN YOU HEAR

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
THE DETAILS COME OUT.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
WE'RE LEARNING THAT ALL OF THE

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
VICTIMS DIED FROM MULTIPLE

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
GUNSHOT WOUNDS.
SOME OF THESE LITTLE KIDS, SIX

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
AND SEVEN YEARS OLD, WERE SHOT

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO 11 TIMES.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
WE'RE ALSO LEARNING THAT THE

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
GUNMAN SHOT INSIDE THE SCHOOL,

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
INSIDE A SECTION OF THE SCHOOL.

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
JUST TWO CLASSROOMS.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
AND THE HALLWAY.

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
AND FROM THIS NEWS CONFERENCE

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
THAT WE LISTENED TO, A LITTLE

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
WHILE AGO, DON, WE ALSO LEARNED

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
THAT THE QUESTION WAS, WILL

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
THESE KIDS RETURN, WILL THE

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
CHILDREN RETURN TO THIS SCHOOL

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
NOW THAT WHAT'S HAPPENED THERE.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
AND THE WAY THAT QUESTION WAS

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
ANSWERED WAS, IT'S TOO EARLY TO

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
SAY WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
HAPPEN.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE POSSIBLY THAT

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
KIDS WILL BE TRANSPORTED TO

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
ANOTHER SCHOOL IN THE AREA.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
AND THAT THEY'RE HOPING, THEY'RE

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
REALLY HOPING THAT THEY KEEP

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
THESE KIDS TOGETHER.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
AND YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND WHY.

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
YOU WANT TO KEEP THESE KIDS

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
TOGETHER WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
SUCH A TRAUMATIC, HORRIBLE

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
EXPERIENCE.

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
DON?
>> DON'T QUOTE ME ON THAT.

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I THINK I HAD A GUEST ON

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
EARLIER, ALLISON.

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE THE RIGHT

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I THINK SHE SAID THEY'RE GOING

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
TO BE TRANSFERRED TO MONROE

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

141
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
THAT APPEARS TO BE IN THE WORKS.

142
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
>>> I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
TALKED TO A MAN WHOSE CHILDREN

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
USED TO GO TO SANDY HOOK

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND HE IS

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
TRYING TO MOBILIZE HIS NEIGHBORS

147
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
TO TAKE ACTION TO PREVENT THESE

148
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
KINDS OF TRAGEDIES FROM

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
HAPPENING TO ANYONE, NOT JUST

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
KIDS.
>> HIS NAME IS LEE SCHULL.

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
TALKING TO ME EARLIER, HOW DO

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
YOU REALLY, YOU KNOW, MAKE SENSE

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
OF THIS?

154
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
HOW DO YOU MOVE FORWARD AFTER

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
THIS.
HE SAYS YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
GRIEVE.
AND HE SAID WHAT HE WANTS TO DO

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
IS TAKE ACTION.
SO WHAT HE'S TRIED TO DO TODAY

158
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
GET AS MANY PEOPLE TOGETHER,

159
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
IN FACT HE'S IN HIS MEETING

160
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
RIGHT NOW.
HE GOT A MEETING TOGETHER WITH

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN NEWTOWN.

162
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO.

163
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
HIS ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO TRY TO

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
MAKE CHANGE HAPPEN TO TRY TO

165
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WHY IT HAPPENED AND TO TRY TO

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
MAKE CHANGE.

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
WHETHER IT'S GUN LAWS OR TRYING

169
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANGE THE

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
MORAL FABRIC OF THIS COUNTRY.

171
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
HE HAS CERTAINLY GOTTEN PEOPLE

172
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
TOGETHER TODAY, AND LISTEN TO

173
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
WHY HE'S DOING THIS.

174
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
>> WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE WORD

175
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
OUT TO THE COUNTRY, WE THOUGHT

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
THIS WAS A SAFE COMMUNITY BUT IN

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
ANY COMMUNITY, WHETHER IT'S A

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
PROLIFERATION OF GUNS AND PEOPLE

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES,

180
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
POSSIBLY, THIS CAN HAPPEN

181
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
ANYWHERE.

182
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
WE NEED TO START HERE AND TAKE

183
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
THIS EVENT AND LEARN FROM IT AND

184
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
WE NEED IT TO GROW ACROSS THE

185
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
COUNTRY.
>> LEE SHULL LIVES IN THE

186
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE GUNMAN

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
LIVED.

188
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
HE SAID HE'S FEELING IT EVEN IN

189
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
HIS HOME.

190
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
EVEN THOUGH HE'S NEVER MET THE

191
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
GUNMAN BEFORE.

192
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
HE SAID HIS DAUGHTER, WHO WENT

193
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
TO THE SCHOOL, WAS AT THE SCHOOL

194
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
IN THAT CLASSROOM WHERE ALL OF

195
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
THOSE CHILDREN WERE GUNNED DOWN.

196
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
HE SAID THREE OTHER GIRLS WHO

197
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
SHARE A DANCE STUDIO WITH ONE OF

198
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
HIS DAUGHTERS, THEY HAVE BEEN

199
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
KILLED.
YOU SEE, YOU SEE HOW THIS

200
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
COMMUNITY IS SO CONNECTED AND

201
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
WHY SOMEONE LIKE LEE SCHULL

202
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
WANTS TO COME OUT AND DO

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
SOMETHING TO FEEL LIKE HE'S

204
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
TRYING TO HELP THE PROCESS

205
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
ALONG.
AS THIS COMMUNITY TRIES TO HEAL

206
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
FROM SOMETHING THAT FEELS LIKE

207
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
IT'S GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO

208
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
HEAL FROM.

209
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
DON?
>> YEAH.

210
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID TO ME,

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
SOME PEOPLE WHO WERE AT THE

212
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
SCHOOL.

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
OTHERS WHO JUST KNOW PEOPLE SAY

214
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
AT THIS POINT THEY FEEL

215
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
HELPLESS.
AND SO YOU KNOW, HE WANTS TO DO

216
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
SOMETHING TO HELP OUT SO HE

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
DOESN'T FEEL HELPLESS.

218
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I THINK IT'S A NORMAL, NATURAL

219
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
FEELING IN THIS SITUATION.

220
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
THANK YOU, ALLISON.

221
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU LATER ON

222
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
THROUGHOUT THE HOUR.
>>> AND FOR MANY PEOPLE,

223
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
ESPECIALLY THE FAMILIES OF THE

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
VICTIMS, YOU KNOW THE BIG

225
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
QUESTION IS WHY.
WHY DID A GUNMAN ALLEGEDLY KILL

226
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
HIS MOTHER, AND THEN GO TO A

227
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
SCHOOL AND KILL INNOCENT

228
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
CHILDREN AND ADULTS?

229
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I WANT TO BRING IN JOHN NaVORRO,

230
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
A FORMER FILER FOR THE FBI, JOE,

231
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
WE DON'T HAVE ANY LETTERS LEFT

232
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
BEHIND.
WE DON'T KNOW A MOTIVE.

233
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
AS A PROFILER, I WONDER WHERE

234
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
YOU BEGIN WHEN SOMEONE, I MEAN

235
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
QUITE HONESTLY, MAY HAVE TAKEN

236
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
MANY OF THE ANSWERS TO HIS

237
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
GRAVE.

238
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
>> THAT'S THE UNFORTUNATE THING.

239
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
IS WE MAY NOT HAVE ALL THE

240
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
ANSWERS.

241
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

242
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
LENARD OVER THE YEARS IS THESE

243
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
INDIVIDUALS DON'T ACT JUST ON

244
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
IMPULSE.

245
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
THIS IS USUALLY SOMETHING THAT'S

246
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE.

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
THERE IS SOME PLANNING.

248
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
THERE'S THE ACQUISITION OF THE

249
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
WEAPONS.
THERE'S OFTENTIMES A LOT OF

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
WOUND COLLECTING WHERE THEY

251
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
FOCUS ON SOCIAL SLIGHTS.

252
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE TO

253
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
THEM.

254
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
THEY NURTURE THESE THINGS AND

255
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THEN THEY USE THAT TO, TO SORT

256
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
OF POTENTIATE THEM, SO WHEN THEY

257
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
ACT OUT, THEY ACT OUT VIOLENTLY.

258
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
>> A LOT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS DO

259
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
GIVE OFF CLUES, THEY DO LEAVE

260
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
BEHIND IN SOCIAL MEDIA.

261
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
SOME INDICATORS.

262
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WE TALK TO SAY

263
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
BOY, THERE WAS SOMETHING QUIRKY,

264
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
ODD, SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

265
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
LOOKING AT THIS INDIVIDUAL.

266
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
BUT NO ONE LIVES WITH A CAMERA

267
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
BEHIND THEM ALL THE TIME.

268
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
SO IT'S OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT TO

269
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
DETECT.
>> BUT JOE, YOU KNOW, I KNOW A

270
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
LOT OF QUIRKY AND ODD PEOPLE.

271
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
SOME PEOPLE MAY SAY THAT I AM

272
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
QUIRKY AND ODD.

273
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
THERE IS -- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

274
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
BETWEEN QUIRKY AND ODD AND GOING

275
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
INTO A SCHOOLHOUSE AND YOU KNOW

276
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
GUNNING PEOPLE DOWN, ESPECIALLY

277
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
CHILDREN.

278
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
IT'S ALWAYS, IT SEEMS TO ALWAYS

279
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
BE YOUNG MEN IN THEIR 20s.

280
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
WHAT'S, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

281
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
>> WELL THERE'S A LOT OF

282
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
THEORIES THAT SAY THIS IS A

283
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
TESTOSTERONE ISSUE.

284
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
WE DON'T HAVE GIRLS GOING OUT

285
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
AND DOING MASS, MASS KILLINGS.

286
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
THAT TESTOSTERONE FOSTERS THIS.

287
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT EVERYBODY

288
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
BECOMES A KILLER.

289
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
>> BECAUSE TESTOSTERONE FLOWS IN

290
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
THEIR VEINS.

291
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT

292
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
PROFESSIONALS.
THINK IF PROFESSIONALS LOOKED AT

293
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
THESE INDIVIDUALS, THEY WOULD

294
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
SAY THERE'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING

295
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
HERE THIS INDIVIDUAL IS

296
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
HARBORING A LOT OF GRIEF OR THEY

297
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
A

298
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
ARE.
>> THINKING ABOUT VIOLENCE TO

299
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
CORRECT A SITUATION.

300
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
>> HEY, JOE, CAN I JUMP IN AND

301
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
ASK YOU THIS.

302
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
WE ALWAYS SAY THEY'RE HARBORING

303
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
GRIEF.

304
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
MOST PEOPLE WHO HARBOR GRIEF.

305
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'VE LOST A NUMBER OF PEOPLE --

306
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
PEOPLE HARBOR GRIEF, YOU DON'T

307
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
TELL PEOPLE ABOUT IT.

308
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
SO NO ONE KNOWS, YOU SORT OF

309
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
KEEP IT ON THE INSIDE.

310
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
HOW CAN YOU PROFILE THAT?

311
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
>> WELL, AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

312
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
YOU KNOW, THE SECRET SERVICE

313
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
LOOKED AT IT.

314
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
AT THIS IN 2004.

315
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
AND FOUND THAT THERE IS NO TEM

316
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
PLA

317
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
PLATE.
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT DO

318
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
COLLECT THESE WOUNDS, THEY DO

319
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
NURTURE THIS GRIEF.

320
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
THAT THEY DO NURTURE THESE

321
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
SOCIAL SLIGHTS.

322
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
>> THEY BUILD ON THEM AND USE

323
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
THEM.

324
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
>> MOST OF US DON'T SIT AROUND

325
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
AND DEBRIEF OUR CHILDREN.

326
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
AND THAT'S WHY, YOU KNOW, TEN

327
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
YEARS ON, SINCE COLUMBINE HIGH

328
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000

329
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
TEMPLATE FOR BEING ABLE TO

330
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
DISSECT THIS.
OTHER THAN WE HAVE TO OBSERVE.

331
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
AND THEN WHEN WE SENSE THAT

332
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
THERE'S ISSUES.

333
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
WE HAVE TO TRY TO GET CHILDREN

334
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
SOME HELP.

335
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
>> YOU BRING UP A VERY GOOD

336
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
POINT.
I THINK THAT'S MAYBE OF THE

337
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
SOLUTIONS THERE.

338
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
WHEN YOU SAY MOST OF US DON'T

339
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
SIT AROUND AND DEBRIEF OUR

340
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
CHILDREN.
MAYBE WE SHOULD EVERY DAY.

341
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
