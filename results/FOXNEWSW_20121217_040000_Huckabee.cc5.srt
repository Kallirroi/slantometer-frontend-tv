THEY BOTH IN CONTACT WITH

THEY ARE IMPORTANT IN THIS

3
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
INVESTIGATION.
POLICE OFFERED MORE CLARITY

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000

9
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
USED IN THE ATTACK.

10
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000

SIDE ARMS A 6 MILLIMETER AND 10

12
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000

ONE OF THE GUNS WERE USED BY THE

13
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
GUNMAN TO KILL HIMSELF WHEN

14
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
WE CAN STAND HERE AND SAY THIS

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
OCCURRED.
WE WILL AND WE ARE SEARCHING

CRIME SCENE.

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
THOSE WERE THE BODIES OF THE

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
GUNMAN AND HIS MOTHER NANCY

WEARING NIGHT CLOTHES.

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000

HEALTH ISSUES.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE WHEN A PERSON

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
HAS CERTAIN BEHAVIORS LIKE WE

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
HAVE SEEN IN THE SHOOTER.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
ARE ANY OF THESE DISORDERS THE

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
TYPE THAT WOULD EXHIBIT

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THEMSELVES IN THIS MANNER?

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
>> NOT IN A MANNER TO WHICH WE

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST SEVERAL

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
DAYS BUT THERE ARE SIGNS AND

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
SYMPTOMS THAT LEAD UP TO CERTAIN

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
BEHAVIORS.
SO IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
THE RED FLAGS AS I CALL THEM YOU

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
KNOW HOW TO IDENTIFY THEM YOU

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
CAN ACTUALLY GO BACK AND SEE

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
WHAT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
>> BUT TO PUT PARENTS AT EASE

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
WHO MAY HAVE A CHILD WHO HAS

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
EITHER AUTISM OR ASPERGER'S A

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
PRESENCE OF SOME FORM OF AWE

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
SICHL OR ASPERGER'S SUBJECT MAKE

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THEM SAY MY CHILD IS A MASS

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
MURDERER JUST BECAUSE OF THE

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
DISORDER.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
>> IT IS REALLY THE BEHAVIORS

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
YOU WANT TO LOOK AT.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
IT'S THE CHANGE IN BEHAVIORS HAD

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
A ARE REALLY OF CONCERN.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
YOU HAVE A CHILD WHO IS DOING

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
WELL IN SCHOOL, SOCIALLY ACTIVE,

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
IS BEHAVING APPROPRIATELY AND

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
SUDDENLY THERE'S A CHANGE THEY

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
BECOME MORE ISOLATE TIVE THEY

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
BECOME MORE SOCIALLY

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
UNENGAGEABLE.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
THEY DON'T WANT TO TO GO TO

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
SCHOOL THEIR GRADES GO DOUVENL

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
THOSE SHOULD BE SIGNS TO PARENTS

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
TO TAKE A LOOK AT AND PUT INTO

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
CONTEXT THE BEHAVIOR AND ANY

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
SYMPTOMS OR ANY DIAGNOSES THAT

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
MAY BE AT PLAY.

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
>> THE REASON I WANT TO DELVE

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I THINK SOME PARENTS SAY I DON'T

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MY CHILD

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
ASPERGER'S OR ANY FORM OF

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
AUTISM.
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A VALID

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
CONCLUSION EITHER IS IT?

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
THERE ARE FIRST OF ALL AUTISM IS

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A SPECTRUM DISORDER.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
SO THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
BEHAVIORS AND SYMPTOMS ALONG THE

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
WAY.
IN ADDITION THERE ARE OTHER

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
DISORDERS THAT ARE AT PLAY.

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
THERE ARE SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
ISSUES AND MAL LODY DISORDERS,

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
CHARACTER LOGICAL DISORDERS.

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
YOU NEED TO FOCUS IN ON WHAT IT

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
IS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
WE TRY VERY HARD TO ASCERTAIN A

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
DIAGNOSIS OR A WORKING DIAGNOSIS

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
AND THEN GO FROM THERE AND SORT

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
OUT WHAT ARE OUR EXPECTATIONS

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT TO BE FIRST

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT TO BE TREATED

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
WHAT INTERVENTIONS CAN WE BRING

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
TO BEAR?
WE WORK AS A TEAM APPROACH SO

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THAT WE CAN BRING IN MENTAL

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, CASE

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
MANAGERS FOR EXAMPLE,

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
PSYCHOLOGISTS DIE KIE TERRORISTS

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
WHO ADDRESS EACH INDIVIDUAL

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
SYMPTOM BASED ON WHAT IS GOING

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
ON PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND I

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
PSYCHIATRICALLY.
>> OUR AUDIENCE HEARD A LOT OF

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
WORDS THROWN AT THEM OVER THE

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
WEEKEND.
WORDS THAT YOU USE EVERY DAY IN

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
THE COURSE OF YOUR PRACTICE OF

135
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
LAW AND PSYCHOLOGY BUT MOST

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
PEOPLE DON'T USE THESE WORDS

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
MAYBE THEY ARE NOT FAMILIAR TO

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
THEM.
WHEN WE SAY THAT A PERSON IS A

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
PSYCHOTIC, HAS PSYCHOTIC

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
BEHAVIORAL TENDENCIES WHAT DOES

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
THAT MEAN?

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
>> THAT USUALLY MEANS A BREAK

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
WITH REALITY.

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO SEE THINGS

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
REALISTICALLY YOU ARE NOT

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
PROCESS THINGS COMING IN IN A

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
REALISTIC WAY.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
>> AND A SOCIOPATH WHAT DOES IT

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
MEAN IF A PERSON IS DESCRIBED AS

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
SOCIOPATHIC?

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
>> SOCIOPATHS IS A CHARACTER

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
LOGICAL DISORDER.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
IT IS MANIFEST BY USUALLY PEOPLE

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
WHO CAN'T FEEL, THEY DON'T HAVE

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
EMPATHY.

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
THEY DON'T CONNECT TO THE USUAL

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
DAY-TO-DAY FEELINGS THAT MOST OF

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
US CAN CONNECT TO.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
>> SO SOME PEOPLE COULD BE SOME

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
WHAT PSYCHOTIC AND SOCIOPATHIC,

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
IS IT POSSIBLE TO BE A PERSON

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
WITH BOTH CHARACTER RYES

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
RISTICKS?
>> FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
EXPERTS I WORK WITH EVERY DAY I

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
BELIEVE THE ANSWER TO THAT WOULD

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
BE YES.

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
>> SO THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO MAKE

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THIS IS VERY COMPLEX.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN TAKE A

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
CHILD AND SAY HE HAS ASPERGER'S

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
THEREFORE HE IS MORE LIKELY TO

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
DO A MASS MURDER AND BY THE WAY

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
THAT MEANS HE IS PSYCHOTIC.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
IT INVOLVES A COMPLEX KIND OF

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
DIAGNOSIS.
>> A COMPLEX DIAGNOSIS AS WELL

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
AS PUTTING IT INTO CONTEXT AND

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
REALLY LOOKING AT HOW TO ACCESS

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
IN THE REAL WORLD.

180
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
THE TREATMENTS MIGHT BE

181
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
INTERVENTION GETTING HELP IT'S

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
THE BIGGEST WE FACE.

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
HAVING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THIS

184
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
THEY CAN GET PAST THAT HURDLE

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
THEY ARE MORE OPEN TO ALLOWING

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
EXPERTS IN THE FIELD TO

187
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
COUNSELORS ASK WHAT'S GOING ON.

374
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I AM SEEING A CHANGE AT HOME.

375
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
>> THERE ARE ALSO BEHAVIORS THAT

376
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
CAN BE TRIGGERED BY FAMILY

377
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
SITUATIONS.

378
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
YOU HAVE A MOTHER AND FATHER WHO

379
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
DIVORCED A FEW YEARS AGO.

380
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
THAT CHANGES THE STRUNG TOUR I

381
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
AM NOT SAYING YOU BLAME THE

382
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
PARENTS BUT IF THE CHILD IS

383
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
MANIFESTING CERTAIN BEHAVIORS

384
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
BECAUSE OF A DIVORCE A DEATH IN

385
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
THE FAMILY A LOSS OF A PET THERE

386
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
COULD BE MANY THINGS HAD A HELP

387
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
TRIGGER BEHAVIORS.

388
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
>> THAT'S WHY WE WORK CLOSELY

389
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
WITH PARENTS TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

390
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE HOME

391
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
WHAT CHANGE LED TO DIFFERENT

392
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
BEHAVIORS IN CHILDREN AND THEN

393
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
BRINGING IN A TEAM OF MENTAL

394
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN

395
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
THEN ADDRESS THE CHANGES.

396
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
BECAUSE THEY ARE AGAIN EASY TO

397
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
IDENTIFY IN A LOT OF CASES YOU

398
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
JUST HAVE TO KNOW WHAT TO LOOK

399
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
FOR.

400
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
>> I THINK PEOPLE ARE AFRAID

401
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
SOMETIMES TO RAISE THE FLAG.

402
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
THEY ARE VERY RELUCTANT WITH

403
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND OTHERS

404
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID EITHER

405
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
OF LIABILITIES OR THEY WILL BE

406
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
SEEN AS STICKING THEIR NOSE IN

407
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
SOMEONE ELSE'S BUSINESS.

408
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
WHERE IS THAT LINE OF PRO PRITY?

409
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
OO I THINK AS WE SEE MORE AND

410
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
MORE OF THESE INCIDENTS AND

411
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
TRAGEDIES THE DIALOGUE IS JUST

412
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
STARTING TO BE MORE TOWARDS WE

413
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AND TALK

414
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
ABOUT IT AND SET UP SYSTEMS TO

415
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
ADDRESS IT.

416
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
AFTER THE AURORA SHOOTING WE

417
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
HEARD ABOUT THE BEHAVIORAL

418
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
INTERVENTION TEAMS ON COLLEGE

419
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
CAMPUSES THEY ARE SET UP

420
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
SPECIFICALLY TO IDENTIFY KIDS AT

421
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
RISK OR KIDS REPORTED TO HAVE AT

422
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
RISK BEHAVIOR OR RED FLAG

423
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
BEHAVIOR.
THEN NOT JUST TO TARGET THEM SO

424
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
TO SPEAK OR SPY ON THEM BUT TO

425
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
COME UP WITH AN INTERVENTION AND

426
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
A RESPONSE THAT IS

427
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
MULTIDISCIPLINARY THAT CAN

428
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT ARE

429
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
BEING BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT.

430
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I BELIEVE UNFORTUNATELY NOW

431
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
SCHOOLS HAVE TO START TO DO

432
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
THAT.
IN THE LOWER SCHOOLS IT IS

433
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
UNIMAGINABLE YOU WOULD DO THAT

434
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT YOU

435
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
NEED TO LOOK AT THAT AND NEED TO

436
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
DO THAT.

437
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
>> CAROLYN THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

438
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
VERY HELPFUL AND PRACTICAL.

439
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE.

440
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

441
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
>> I HOPE PEOPLE WILL USE THIS

442
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALIZE IF

443
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
THERE IS EVIDENCE OF MENTAL

444
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
ILLNESS IN YOUR CHILD OR

445
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
YOURSELF THAT YOU DON'T FEEL

446
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
LIKE SOMEHOW IT OUGHT TO BE

447
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
EMBARRASSING TO GET HELP.

448
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
WE OUGHT TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE

449
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
IT IS EMBARRASSING TO NOT GET

450
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
THE HELP.

451
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I WILL TALK TO ALLEN DEDER S--

452
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
ABOUT WHAT HE WOULD LIKE IF HE

453
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
WENT TO TRIAL.

454
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
>> ALLEN HAS REPRESENTED SOME OF

455
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
AMERICA'S MOST REVILED

456
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
DEFENDANTS LIKE CLAUSE VAN BEULE

457
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
LOW AND O.J. SIMPSON IN THE CASE

458
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
OF THE CONNECTICUT SHOOTING THE

459
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
GUNMAN IS DEAD.

460
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
THERE WILL BE NO TRIAL.

461
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
BUT I ASKED THE PROFESSOR HAD

462
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
THE GUNMAN LIVED HOW OLD HE

463
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
DEFEND SOMEONE RESPONSIBLE FOR

464
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST HEINOUS

465
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
CRIMES.
>> IT'S THE CALL EVERY GOOD

466
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
LAWYER DREADS GENERALLY HAPPENS

467
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
A JUDGE WILL CALL YOU AND SAY

468
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
YOU ARE A RESPECTED LAWYER, THE

469
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
SYSTEM REQUIRES THIS MAN BE

470
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED YOU HAVE THE

471
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
JOB OF DEFENDING HIM.

472
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR VERY BEST.

473
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW IS AN

474
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
EMERGENCY DOCTOR AT COLUMBIA

475
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL.

476
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
THEY WHEEL PEOPLE INTO HER WHO

477
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
ARE TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE HUMAN

478
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
BEINGS SHE HAS TO MAKE THEM

479
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
BETTER THE SYSTEM REQUIRES THAT.

480
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
IN THAT CAA CASE LIKE THIS YOU

481
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
LOOK INTO HIS MENTAL BACKGROUND

482
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
YOU SEE IF THERE'S A PLAUSIBLE

483
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
CLAIM OF MENTAL ILLNESS.

484
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
YOU KNOW IF HE GOES TO JAIL HE

485
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
WILL BE KILLED IN JAIL.

486
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
THE WORST TREATMENT ARE GIVEN TO

487
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
PEOPLE WHO KILLED YOUNG CHILDREN

488
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
UNDERSTANDABLY SO, AND SO IT IS

489
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
ALWAYS GOING TO BE A LIFE AND

490
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
DEATH MATTER EVEN IF HE IS

491
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
FACING LIFE IMPRISONMENT.

492
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
>> YOU HAVE PERSONAL FEELINGS

493
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
YOU HAVE TO SET ASIDE.

494
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
>> IT IS SO HARD.

495
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
YOU WANT TO SEE THIS SOB GET THE

496
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
LONGEST POSSIBLE SENTENCE.

497
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
THE FIRST INCLINATION IS YOU

498
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
WANT TO STRANGLE THE MAN WITH

499
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
YOUR BARE HANDS.

500
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
WE HAVE ALL EXPERIENCED THAT.

501
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
YOU HAVE TO DISTANCE YOURSELF BE

502
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
PROFESSIONAL ABOUT IT AND YOU

503
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SYSTEM IS

504
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
ON TRIAL WHEN EVER THE MOST

505
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
NOTORIOUS OFFENDERS.

506
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I REMEMBER BEING IN REAL SHORTLY

507
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
AFTER THE EICHMANN TRIAL WHEN A

508
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
MAN WHO KILLED IS RESPONSIBLE

509
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
FOR KILLING 6 MILLION JEWS WENT

510
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
ON TRIAL.
HE HAD A VIGOROUS DEFENSE

511
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
ATTORNEY WHO DID A GOOD JOB.

512
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
COULDN'T SAVE THEM, OBVIOUSLY

513
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
BUT THAT'S THE DREADED MOMENT

514
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
EVERY LAWYER FACES IS BEING

515
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
CALLED ON TO HIS OR HER DUTY IN

516
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
A CASE LIKE THIS.

517
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
>> IS THERE A TENDENCY TO TRY TO

518
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
GET THAT PERSON TO PLEAD GUILTY

519
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
TO GET IT OVER WITH AND TAKE A

520
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
PLEA DEAL AS OPPOSED TO GOING

521
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
THROUGH TRIAL OR PLEAD INNOCENT?

522
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
DO YOU ACTUALLY SAY DO YOU WANT

523
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
TO PLEAD INNOCENT?

524
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
>> YOU GIVE THE PERSON ALL OF

525
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
THE OPTIONS.
THEY GENERALLY DON'T WANT TO

526
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
PLEAD GUILTY.

527
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
THEY ALSO DON'T WANT YOU TO

528
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
PLEAD AN INSANITY DEFENSE.

529
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
THEY WANT YOU TO GET UP THERE

530
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
AND JUSTIFY IT AND EXPLAIN TO

531
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
THE WRORLD WORLD WHY HE DID THE

532
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
THING.
POLITICAL DEFENSES AREN'T

533
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
ALLOWED AND SHOULDN'T BE

534
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
ALLOWED.
BUT DEALING WITH THE CLIENT WILL

535
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
BE ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS.

536
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I HAVE HAD CLIENTS THREATEN ME

537
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
ONE CLIENT TRY TO STRANGLE ME.

538
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
HE HAD BEEN TURNING ON HIS

539
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
FRIENDS.
BEING A CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYER

540
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
IS NOT THE SAFEST OR EASIEST

541
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
JOB.

542
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
IF YOU WIN, WHICH IN A CASE LIKE

543
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
THIS YOU COULDN'T, THEN MILLIONS

544
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
OF PEOPLE HATE YOU AND WANT TO

545
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
GET YOU I HAD TO HAVE A FEDERAL

546
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
AGENT FOLLOW ME AROUND BECAUSE I

547
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
WOULDN'T TAKE THE CASE ANY MORE.

548
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
THE PERSON I WOULDN'T TAKE THE

549
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
CASE FROM PUT A HIT OUT ON ME.

550
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
>> WE HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION,

551
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO DEFEND

552
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
SOMEONE IF WE KNOW -- NOT JUST

553
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
KNOW HE'S GUILTY BUT KNOW HE IS

554
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
GUILTY OF SOMETHING SO

555
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
OUTRAGEOUS SO HEINOUS THERE IS

556
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
NOT A PERSON IN THIS SOCIETY

557
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
THAT DEFENDS THE ACTION OF THE

558
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
PERSON WHO DID IT?

559
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
>> IT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

560
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
ONCE YOU SAY THERE ISN'T ANYBODY

561
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
WHO CAN GET A DEFENSE WHICH

562
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
PROVIDE ALL DEFENDANTS MUST BE

563
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED THEN WE MOVE

564
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
THE LINE WHAT IF WE ARE ALMOST

565
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
CERTAIN HE DID SOMETHING SO WERE

566
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
TERRIBLE EVEN INNOCENCE

567
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
SHOULDN'T BE A DEFENSE.

568
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
YOU VISSER RATE THE BASIC

569
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
FUNDAMENTAL DEFENSES.

570
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
OUR JOB IS TO DEFEND THE SOB'S.

571
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
COME AFTER THEM FIRST.

572
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
THEN THEY APPLY THE LAW TO THE

573
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
REST OF US.

574
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
EVERY TIME YOU DEFEND A

575
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PERSON YOU

576
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
ARE DEFENDING SOMEBODY WHO LOVES

577
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
YOU AND YOU LOVE AND YOU MAY BE

578
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
IN TROUBLE STATEMENT IN TIME.

579
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
SOME SAY A LIBERAL WHO HAS BEEN

580
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
MUGGED.

581
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
THERE'S TRUTH TO THAT.

582
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
A KID HAS BEEN BUSTED ON A

583
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
CHARGE AND REALLY NEED YOU TO

584
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
COME AND DPEE FEND HIM ON THE

585
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
BASIS OF THE 6TH AMENDMENT OR

586
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
4TH AMENDMENT.

587
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA IS THAT

588
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
OUR RIGHTS APPLY TO EVERYBODY.

589
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH

590
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
RIGHTS.
IF I WERE WRITING THE

591
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
CONSTITUTION I WOULD NOT PUT A

592
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
SECOND AMENDMENT IN THERE.

593
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
>> BUT IS IT IS IN THERE AND I E

594
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
TO DEFEND THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE

595
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
REASONABLY REGULATED TO BE SURE

596
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
BUT THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO HAVE

597
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
ACCESS TO GUNS.

598
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
WE MAY NOT LIKE EVERYTHING IN

599
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
THE CONSTITUTION BUT IT SERVED

600
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
US VERY WELL.

601
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
THE LONGEST ENDURING

602
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
CONSTITUTION IN HISTORY IT AIN'T

603
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
BROKE WE SHOULD NOT BE TAMPERING

604
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
WITH IT.

605
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
>> I AM SO GLAD YOU SAID THAT.

606
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I THINK SOMETIMES WE FORGET WHAT

607
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
AN AMAZING DOCUMENT.

608
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
THEY CAME TOGETHER AND

609
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
MIRACULOUSLY ENDED UP WITH A

610
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
DOCUMENT THAT GOVERNED US AND

611
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
GIVEN US A GOVERNMENT THAT IS

612
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
THE ENVY OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD.

613
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
>> IT IS A MIRACLE.

614
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN TODAY.

615
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
WE COULD NEVER GET AGREEMENT

616
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
TODAY ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT

617
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
WHAT DOES IT MEAN ABOUT PRAYER

618
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
IN THE SCHOOLS.

619
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
COULDN'T GET AN AGREEMENT ON THE

620
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
5TH AMENDMENT.

621
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
WE WERE FORTUNATE TO GET A

622
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
COLLECTION OF RIGHTS.

623
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
THIRD AMENDMENT YOU CAN'T

624
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
QUARTER TROOPS IN YOUR HOME.

625
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
BUT THAT DEALS WITH PRIVACY

626
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
RIGHTS.

627
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
THE HOME IS YOUR CASTLE.

628
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
WHEN THE EASTERN EUROPEAN GOT

629
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
THEIR UNION WAS DEFEATED THE

630
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
FIRST CONSTITUTIONS THEY LOOK TO

631
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
WAS THE UNITED STATES

632
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
CONSTITUTION.

633
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
>> A GREAT REMINDER WE HAVE A

634
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
SYSTEM.
WE DON'T JUST LET OURSELVES BE

635
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
GOVERNED BY OUR EMOTIONS BUT BY

636
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
OUR CONSTITUTION AND LAWS.

637
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
>> OUR SYSTEM GOES ON TRIAL

638
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
EVERY TIME WE SEE A CAT CAST FEE

639
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
LIKE THIS ONE.

640
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
>> THANK YOU.

641
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
>> THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS

IS THERE AN ANSWER TO THAT

646
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
QUESTION?
I WILL ASK PASTOR JOEL OLSTEEN

647
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000

AFTER 21 MONTHS OF CIVIL WAR

677
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
UNLIKELY EITHER SIDE COULD WIN A

678
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
DECISIVE MILITARY VICTORY.

679
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THE REBELS

680
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
ARE THE SOLUTION TO SYRIAN

681
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
PROBLEMS AND THAT IF THEY WON IT

682
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
MIGHT BRING CHAOS TO THE

683
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
COUNTRY.

684
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000

743
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
ARE SAFE AND PRAYER.

744
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
CHURCH OFFICIALS LOCKED UP THE

745
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
SANCTUARY SAYING THE PRIESTS

746
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
HAVE A LOT TO PREPARE FOR.

747
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
8 OF THE 26 VICTIMS ARE FROM

748
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
THIS PERISH ALONE, GOVERNOR.

749
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
>>> WHEN A TRAGEDY LIKE THIS

750
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
HAPPENS.
I AM UNDOUBTEDLY ASKING WHY.

751
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
>> I SPOKE WITH JOEL OLSTEEN AND

752
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
HIS WIFE.

753
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
WHAT DO YOU TELL PEOPLE WHEN

754
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
THEY ASK HIM.

755
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
WHY DIDN'T THEY STOP SOMETHING

756
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
LIKE THIS FROM HAPPENING.

757
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
>> I THINK THE BIGGEST THING WE

758
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS GOD SAGAV

759
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
US OUR OWN FREE WILL.

760
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
HE DIDN'T MAKE US ROBOTS.

761
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
UNFORTUNATELY JUST AS YOU CAN

762
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
CHOOSE GOOD OR EVIL.

763
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
IT'S NOT A PERFECT PLACE.

764
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
JESUS CAN'T SAY IN THIS WORYOU

765
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
GOING -- YOU PUT YOUR TRUST IN

766
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
THE LORD AND HE WILL GIVE YOU

767
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
THE STRENGTH TO MAKE IT THROUGH

768
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
EVEN THOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT.

769
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
>> WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT THAT

770
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
STRENGTH HOW DO THEY FIND IT?

771
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
OP WHY YOU WILL PEOPLE WHO BRAY

772
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
OUT TO GOD IN PRAYER.

773
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
THEY HEAR ABOUT PRAYER, NEVER NE

774
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
DON IT.

775
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
WHAT DO THEY DO?

776
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
>> I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT.

777
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
TO ME IT'S FINE TO BE.

778
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I THINK YOU ARE HONEST WITH GOD

779
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
SCRIPTURE SAYS MY ENCOURAGEMENT

780
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE BET BIGGER HE

781
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
WOULDN'T HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN.

782
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I GO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION I

783
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
SAY IN THESE TOUGH TIMES I AM

784
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
GOING TO TURN TO MY FAITH AND

785
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
BELIEF GOD IS FOR ME.

786
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
IT'S A SIMPLE ACT OF FAITH.

787
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
IT MAY NOT MAKE SENSE TO YOUR

788
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
MIND YOU HAVE GOD HAS GOT YOU IN

789
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
THE HAND.

790
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
>> SO MANY PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO

791
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
FIND THE SOLID GROUND OF THEIR

792
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
FAITH RIGHT NOW.

793
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
THERE'S NO WAY TO MAKE SENSE

794
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CHILDREN

795
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
WELLS TO THE EACHTEACHERS.

796
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
WHAT ADVICE DO YOU GIVE THEM FOR

797
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET

798
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
BACK THEIR FAIRT IN A MOMENT

799
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
WHEN DE THIS HAVE ANY HUMAN

800
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
UNDERSTANDING AND HUMAN WORDS TO

801
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
EXPRESS HOW THEY FEEL.

802
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
>> THERE ARE NO HUMAN WORDS TO

803
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
EXPLAIN WHAT HAS HAPPENED OR AT

804
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT GIVE

805
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
COMFORT.

806
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
BUT I BELIEVE AS THE COMMUNITY

807
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
GATHERS TOGETHER AS THEY SUPPORT

808
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
ONE ANOTHER, IF THEY LOVE ONE

809
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
ANOTHER.
THERE ARE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN

810
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
SOMETHING DEFR STATES TO US.

811
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
WE HAVE TO RUN TO GOD TO BELIEVE

812
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
HE HAS LOVED US AND HE CARES

813
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
ABOUT US AND WE CAN GIVE

814
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
THROUGH.
>> VICTORIA YOU ARE A MOM.

815
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I AM SURE THIS WEEKEND HAS

816
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
BROUGHT UP TEEP EMOTIONS TO

817
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
EVERY MOTHER IN AMERICA.

818
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO YOUR OWN

819
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
CHILDREN THIS WEEKEND ABOUT THIS

820
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
HORRIFIC GLAM CRIME.

821
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY?

822
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
>> THE FIRST THING WE DID IS WE

823
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
PRAYED FOR THOSE FAMILIES.

824
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
WE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT HOW THIS

825
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
IS DIFFICULT FOR THE FAMILIES.

826
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
THERE IS NO EXPLANATION FOR WHAT

827
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
HAD HAPPENED.

828
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
THERE IS PEOPLE THAT DO THINGS

829
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
THAT THEY SHOULDN'T DO AND THERE

830
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
IS EVIL IN THE WORLD.

831
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
BUT THE WAY I BEGIN TO SAY IS

832
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
LET'S PRAY FOR THESE FAMILIES

833
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
AND LIFT THEM UP.

834
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
THAT'S OUR PART RIGHT NOW.

835
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
OF COURSE YOU REALLY CAN'T

836
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
EXPLAIN WHY SOMEONE DOES OR

837
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
DOESN'T DO WHAT THEY DO.

838
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
IT WAS AN EVIL ACT.

839
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I JUST THINK SOMETIMES WE HAVE

840
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
TO SAY LET'S PRAY AND JOIN OUR

841
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
FAITH TOGETHER WITH THESE

842
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
FAMILIES.
WE MAY NOT KNOW THEM BUT WE CAN

843
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
PRAY FOR THEM AND PRAYER MAKES A

844
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
DIFFERENCE.
>> THE PRESIDENT SHOWED AN

845
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
UNUSUAL LEVEL OF EMOTION CHOKING

846
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
BACK OBVIOUS TEARS AS HE

847
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
RECOGNIZED THESE WERE KIDS VERY

848
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
MUCH LIKE HIS OWN AND IT

849
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
OCCURRED TO ME THIS IS A MAN WHO

850
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
MAY BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

851
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
STATES BUT HE IS A DAD.

852
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I THINK HE SPOKE AND FELT FOR

853
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
EVERY FATHER IN HIS COUNTRY WHEN

854
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000

FEELINGS AS A DAD HOW DOWRY

ASSURE YOUR KIDS WE DOO TO BE

858
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
AFRAID THE NEXT TIME WE THENT ON

859
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
THE SIDEWALKS AND THE STREETS.

860
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
>> YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE GOD HAS

861
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
YOU IN THE FALL AM OF HIS HANDS

862
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
AND NOTHING WITH SNATCH YOU

863
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
AWAY.
THE NUMBER OF DAYS GOD WILL

864
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
FULFILL.
WE UNDERSTAND IT WHY SOME KIDS

865
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
WERE TAKEN OTHERS WERE NOT.

866
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
WE TO TRUST GOD IS IN CONTROL.

867
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
NOT LIVE YOUR LIVES BITTER.

868
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
WE PRAYED AND THEN IT REIGNITED

869
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
OUR FAITH LET'S REACH OUT TO

870
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
OTHERS.
WE TALKED ABOUT GOVERNOR -- IT

871
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000

872
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
AS A GIFT.

873
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE WE WILL

874
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
HAVE TOMORROW WITH EACH OTHER.

875
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I HOPE WE DO.

876
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
IT REALLY HELPS TO GET OUR

877
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
PRIORITIES RIGHT?

878
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000

APPRECIATION.

RETURN.

884
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
>> BACK WITH JOEL AND VICTORIA

885
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
OLSTEEN FROM THEIR CHURCH IN

886
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
HOUSTON TEXAS.

887
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
DID YOU WATCH YOUR KIDS WATCH

888
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
THE COVERAGE ON THE NEWS AND HOW

889
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
DID YOU MONITOR TO MAKE SURE IT

890
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
WASN'T TOO MUCH OF AN EMOTIONAL

891
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
OVER LOAD FOR THEM?

892
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
>> OUR CHILDREN ARE 17 AND 14.

893
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
THEY ARE A LITTLE OLDER THAN IF

894
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I HAD FIRST, SECOND GRADERS.

895
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
IT IS REALLY A HARD THING, WAS

896
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
EVERY WHERE YOU LOOK THEY ARE

897
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
TALKING ABOUT IT.

898
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I THINK THERE'S GOOD REPORTS OUT

899
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
THERE.

900
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE HEROS

901
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
THAT CAME THROUGH EVEN THOUGH

902
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
THEY COST HEAR LIFE THE TEACHERS

903
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
WHO TOOK THE CHILDREN UNDER HEAR

904
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
WINGS AND BEGAN TO PROTECT THEM.

905
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
THERE ARE THOSE HEROS.

906
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
YOU CAN ALSO FOCUS ON THE FACT

907
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
THAT THERE WERE CHILDREN WHO

908
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
MADE IT OUT THERE ARE HEROS.

909
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
FAMILIES CAN COME TOGETHER THE

910
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
COMMUNITY WILL BE STRONGER.

911
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
IT IS A SMALL COMMUNITY.

912
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
THEY WILL COME TOGETHER AND BE

913
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
STRONG AND TALK ABOUT THE

914
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
OUTCOME IF THERE IS A GREAT

915
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
LOSS.

916
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
GOD STILL IS IN CONTROL.

917
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
THERE ARE STILL GOOD DAYS AHEAD.

918
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
>> OUR SOCIETY HAS BECOME SO

919
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
CYNICAL VERY SECULAR.

920
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
THEY REJECT THE NOTION THAT

921
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
FAITH IS A LITTLE MORE THAN SOME

922
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
EMOTIONAL PRACTICE WE GO

923
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
THROUGH.

924
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
HOW CAN PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THERE

925
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
IS SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIVE

926
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
GOING ON FAITH AND PRAYER IS

927
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
REAL?

928
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
IT DOES EFFECT THE WAY THAT WE

929
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
LIVE AND THINK AND RELATE TO THE

930
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
TRAGEDIES OF OUR LIVES.

931
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL IT'S US

932
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
MAKING OURSELVES FEEL BETTER BY

933
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
SAYING WORDS THAT MIGHT AS WE

934
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
WILL BE ABRACADABRA.

935
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN MAKE

936
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
THEM.

937
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
ONE WAY YOU LIVE BY XAVRP.

938
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
SOMETIMES TRAGEDIES THRIVE THEM

939
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
TO KNOW THE LORD.

940
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I AM LIKE YOU ONCE YOU HAVE

941
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
TASTED WHAT IT MEANS TO FEEL THE

942
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
LORD AND YOU FEEL THE PEACE AND

943
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
STRENGTH THAT HE GIVES YOU CAN'T

944
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
TAKE THAT AWAY.

945
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PEOPLE THAT

946
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
DON'T UNDERSTAND IT WE SEE THAT

947
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
BACK IN THE BIBLE EVEN SAUL OF

948
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
TAR SUS BUT GOD KNEW HOW TO GET

949
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
HIS ATTENTION.
I THINK A BIG PART OF OUR

950
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
MINISTRY IS SPREADING HOPE

951
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
SAYING GOD IS FOR YOU HE'S GOOD

952
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
AND IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO

953
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
SERVE HIM TO HONOR HIM WITH YOUR

954
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
LIFE.

955
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
IT'S NOT JUST THE GOOD TIMES BUT

956
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
THE TOUGH TIMES.

957
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
LIKE VICTORIA SAID YOU DON'T RUN

958
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
AWAY FROM GOD YOU RUN TO GOD AND

959
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
SAY GOD MY HEART IS BREAKING.

960
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN.

961
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
YOU ARE HONEST WITH GOD THAT'S

962
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
WHEN YOU SEE -- YOU WILL FEEL

963
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
GOD'S PEACE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER

964
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
FELT BEFORE.

965
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
>> I KNOW YOU BOTH SPEAK TO

966
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE EVERY WEEK

967
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
FLEW TELEVISION AND THERE AT

968
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
LAKEWOOD.
I APPRECIATE YOUR SHARING AN

969
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
ENCOURAGING MESSAGE AND A

970
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
MESSAGE OF HOPE TO ALL WHO ARE

971
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
WATCHING TONIGHT.
JOEL VICTORIA OSTEEN, GOD BLESS

972
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
YOU.
>> GOD BLESS YOU.

973
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
APPRECIATE YOU.

974
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
>> I WILL BE BACK WITH CLOSING

975
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
THOUGHTS.

976
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
>> I SAID CONTROVERSIAL THINGS

977
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
FROM TIME TO TIME BUT NONE AS

978
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
WHEN I STATED THE HORRIFIC

979
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
SHOOTING IN SCHOOLTEACHERS

980
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
COULDN'T BE BLAMED ON GOD

981
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
BECAUSE WE MARGINALIZED GOD

982
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
RIGHT OUT OF OUR CULTURE BY

983
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
REMOVING HIM FROM ALL ASPECTS OF

984
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
THE PUBLIC SQUARE.

985
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
THE VICIOUS ATTACKS THAT

986
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
RESULTED MOST ALL OF WHICH ARE

987
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
BASED ON TOTAL IGNORANCE OF WHAT

988
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I ACTUALLY SAID HAVE VALIDATED

989
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
MY POINT.

990
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
BUT I AM QUITE CERTAIN THAT WAS

991
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
NOT THE INTENT OF THE

992
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
PROFESSIONAL AND AMATEUR CRITICS

993
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
WHO DEMANDED EVERYTHING FROM MY

994
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
BEING BANNED FROM EVER SPEAKING

995
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
IN PUBLIC AGAIN OR EVEN WHO WISH

996
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
ME A SLOW AND PAINFUL DEATH.

997
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
ON THAT ALONE, I WISH TO

998
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE IT HAS

999
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
SHOWN IT DEFINES TOLERANCE AND

1000
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
DIVERSITY AS BEING TOLERANT ONLY

1001
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
OF THAT WITH WHICH IT AGREES AND

1002
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
THE VERSE ONLY TO INCLUDE SIDE

1003
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
SHADES OF THE ORTHODOX

1004
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
LIBERALISM OF WHICH THEY HEAR.

1005
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
THEY ABORE CENSORSHIP OF GRAPHIC

1006
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
VIOLENCE BUT THE FIRST TO DEMAND

1007
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
A VOICE THAT INVOKES THE NAME OF

1008
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
GOD OUGHT TO BE SILENCED.

1009
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
A SPECIFIC ACT OF VIOLENCE IS

1010
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
RARELY THE RESULT OF A SPECIFIC

1011
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
SINGLE ACT OF A CULTURE THAT

1012
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
PROMPTS IT.

1013
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I WOULD NEVER SAY SIMPLY TAKING

1014
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
PRAYER AND BIBLE READING FROM

1015
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
OUR INSTITUTIONS OR SILENCING

1016
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
CHRISTMAS CAROLS IS THE DIRECT

1017
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
CAUSE OF A MASS MURDER.

1018
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
THAT WOULD BE LUDICROUS AND

1019
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
SIMPLIST

1020
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
SIMPLISTIC.

1021
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
BUT THE CAUSE AND EFFECT WE SEE

1022
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
AN THE CHANGES OF WHAT OUR

1023
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
CHILDREN ARE CAPABLE OF IS A

1024
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
PART OF A CULTURAL SHIFT FROM A

1025
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
GOD CENTERED CULTURE TO A SELF

1026
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
CENTERED CULTURE.

1027
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
GLORIFY UNINHIBITED SIEELF

1028
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
EXPRESSION AND THEN WE ARE

1029
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
SHOCKED WE HAVE A GENERATION OF

1030
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
LOAN ANOTHERS.

1031
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
WE HAVE INSISTED ON A SOCIETY

1032
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
WHERE EVERYONE GETS A TROPHY AND

1033
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
NO ONE LOSES AND THEN ACT

1034
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
SURPRISED SO MANY KIDS LACK

1035
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
SELF-ESTEEM AND FEEL LIKE

1036
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
LOSERS.
WE DISMISS THE NOTION OF NATURAL

1037
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
LAW AND THE MOTINOTION THAT THE

1038
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
ARE MORAL ABSOLUTES AND SEEM

1039
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
AMAZED WHEN SOME KIDS MAKE IT

1040
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
THEIR OWN MORALITY TO KILL

1041
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
INNOCENT CHILDREN.

1042
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
WE DIMINISH EVEN HOLD IN

1043
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
CONTEMPT THE NATURAL FAMILY OF A

1044
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
FATHER AND MOTHER CREATING AND

1045
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
RESPONSIBLY RAISING THE NEXT

1046
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
GENERATION AND THEN EXPRESS

1047
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
DISMAY THAT KIDS FEEL NO REAL

1048
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
CONNECTION TO THEIR FAMILIES OR

1049
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
EVEN THE CONCEPT OF A FAMILY.

1050
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
WE SCOFF AT THE NEED FOR MOTHERS

1051
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
AND FATHERS TO MAKE IT THEIR

1052
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
PRIORITY TO TRAIN THEIR CHILDREN

1053
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
TO BE STRONG IN SPIRIT AND SOUL

1054
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR RIGHT AND

1055
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
WRONG AND EXALT INSTEAD THE VIR

1056
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
S

1057
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
DUE OF HAVING THINGS PROVIDING

1058
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
EXPENSIVE GAMES TOYS THAT

1059
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
SUBSTITUTE FOR PARENTING.

1060
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY OUR KIDS

1061
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
WOULD HAVE EAR BUDS DANGLING TO

1062
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
THE EARS FINGERS ATTACH TO DO A

1063
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
SMART PHONE AND FACE ATTACHED TO

1064
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
A COMPUTER SCREEN RATHER THAN

1065
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
HAVE EXTENDED CONVERSATION WITH

1066
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
THEIR FAMILY AT DINNER.

1067
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
WE DON'T TEACH THEM THERE'S A

1068
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
CREATOR GOD WHO SETS RULES A GOD

1069
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
WHO IS KNOWABLE AND TO WHOM WE

1070
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
ARE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE.

1071
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
WE TEACH THEM GOD WAS NOT

1072
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
INVOLVED IN OUR ORIGINS.

1073
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
OUR VERY LOIFS WERE BIOLOGICAL

1074
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
HAPPEN STANCES THOSE ARE

1075
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
DISPOSABLE SHOULD THEY BE

1076
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
INCONVENIENT.
BEHAVIORS ARE NOT SIN BUT

1077
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
DISORDERS FOR WHICH WE OUGHT TO

1078
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
BE EX CLUED AT LEAST

1079
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
ACCOMMODAT

1080
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
ACCOMMODATED.

1081
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I REALIZE IT IS MORE OUTDATED

1082
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
AND ARCHAIC.

1083
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
IF IT WAS FROM THE SOCIAL

1084
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
CONTRACT WE GOT IN TROUBLE FOR

1085
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
SCHOOL FOR TALKING ACRASS.

1086
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
PULLING A GIRL'S PIGTAILS OR

1087
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
SLOUCHING IN HER SCHOOL DESK.

1088
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
WE TOOK GUNS TO BE SCHOOL TO BE

1089
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
SURE.

1090
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
WE USED THEM BEFORE AND AFTER

1091
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
SCHOOL

1092
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
SCHOOL.

1093
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
THEY WERE IN OUR TRUCKS.

1094
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HER.

1095
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I SHOULD STAND THE CONTEMPT AND

1096
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
CRITICISM.
I WILL GLAD LIE ACCEPT THEIR

1097
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
TORN WITH A DESTEADY STREAM.

1098
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I AM SOME KIND OF AN IDIOT.

1099
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
IS BUT WHEN WE AS A NATION

1100
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
FEARED GOD WE DIDN'T FEAR THAT A

1101
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
20-YEAR-OLD WITH A HIGH POWERED

1102
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
RIFLE WOULD GUN DOWN OUR

1103
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
CHILDREN IN THEIR SCHOOL ROOMS.

1104
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS MIKE

1105
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
HUCKABEE.

1106
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
IDEA FIGHNIGH

1107
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
-- GOOD NIGHT.
GOD BLESS.
