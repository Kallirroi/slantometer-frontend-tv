WHY ADAM LANZA MAY CHOOSE TO GO

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
INTELLIGENT AND SOCIALLY

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
AWKWARD.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
A RETIRED STOCKBROKER, NANCY

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
LANZA WAS A LIFELONG RED SOX FAN

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
WITH SEASON TICKETS WHO LIVED

77
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
WITH HER SON ADAM IN A LARGE

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
COLONIAL HOME AND FRIENDS SAY

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
SHE WAS A LITTLE CONTRADICTION,

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
EXTREMELY GENEROUS AND FRIENDLY

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
YET EXTREMELY PRIVATE WHEN IT

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
CAME TO HER FAMILY LIFE.

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THEY SAY SHE DID TALK ABOUT THE

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
CHALLENGES SHE FACED RAISING A

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
SON WITH AS PERGERS SYNDROME AND

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
HER FRIENDS SAY SHE THOUGHT SHE

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
MAY SOON BE LEAVING NEWTOWN.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
>> SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
WASHINGTON STATE AND READY TO

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
CHANGE HER WHOLE LIFE, SELL HER

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
HOUSE AND START OVER, JUST FOR

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
HIM, JUST SO HE COULD GO TO

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
SCHOOL AND HE WAS HER LIFE.

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
>> FRIENDS SAY NANCE ALANZA WAS

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
A GUN ENTHUSIAST AND HAD TAKEN

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
UP TARGET SHOOTING AS A HOBBY

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
AND THEY INSIST SHE WAS ALWAYS

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
RESPONSIBLE WITH GUNS.

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
>> THEY PAINTED HER AS SOME

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
IRRESPONSIBLE GUN FREAK AND SHE

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
WASN'T.
SHE WAS THE EPITOME OF

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
RESPONSIBILITY AND SHE WAS A

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
PARAGON FOR GUN SAFETY AND

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
TAUGHT THE BOYS HOW TO USE THE

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
GUNS RESPONSIBLY.

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
>> LITTLE DID SHE KNOW THE SON

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
SHE DOTED ON AND TAUGHT HOW TO

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
USE GUNS WOULD TURN THOSE GUNS

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
ON HER AND CHILDREN.

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
THEY BELIEVE HE SHOT AND KILLED

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
HIS MOTHER AS SHE WAS LYING IN

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
BED BEFORE TAKING HER GUNS, TWO

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
OF HER HANDGUNS AND AN ASSAULT

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
RIFLE.
I SAT DOWN WITH SOME OF NANCY'S

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
RESTAURANTS, A PLACE SHE WENT TO

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
IT IS CALLED MY PLACE AND I

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
ASKED THEM ABOUT WHO WAS NANCY

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
LANZA?

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
>> 12 YEARS AGO, 12, 15 YEARS

122
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
AGO, MET HER HERE IN THE BAR.

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000

FRIENDS WITH US.

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
SHE DID A LOT IN TOWN AND WAS

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
ALWAYS ON THE GO.

141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000

142
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
SOUNDS LIKE YOU KNOW HER WELL.

143
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
>> TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK.

144
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000

HER TICKETS.
>> WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME SHE

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
CAME IN.
>> I SAW HER LAST WEEK OR TWO

153
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
WEEKS AGO TO TOPS AND SHE CAME

154
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
IN AND I WAS TALKING TO HER FOR

155
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
A LITTLE BIT.

156
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
YEAH.
SHE CAME IN MORE TO PICK UP FOOD

157
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
>> NOW, YOU DIDN'T MEET THE

158
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
BOYS, RIGHT?
>> YEAH.

159
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
>> YOU KNEW ONE OF THEM.

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
>> I KNEW BOTH.

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
RYAN WORKED FOR ME FOR A

162
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
YEAR-AND-A-HALF.
HE WAS A BUSSER.

163
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
>> HE WAS?

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
OKAY.

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
>> ADAM WAS NEVER A SOCIAL

166
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
PERSON.
HE USED TO COME IN AND KEEP HIS

167
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
HEAD DOWN AND NEVER SURE OF

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
HIMSELF.
>> YOU KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING?

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
>> SHE TOLD US THAT HE HAD THE

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
CONDITION THERE, ASBERGER'S AND

171
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
ALWAYS HAD AN ISSUE IN SCHOOL

172
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
SOCIALLY BECAUSE HE WAS A VERY

173
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
HIGHLY INTELLIGENT KID AND HIGH

174
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I.Q. AND GRADUATED AROUND TENTH

175
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000

176
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
>> GRADUATED EARLY.

177
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
>> YEAH, LIKE TENTH GRADE, YEAH,

178
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
VERY, VERY INTELLIGENT KID, AND

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I MENTIONED EARLIER, TOO, A LOT

180
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
OF PEOPLE ARE MENTIONING

181
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
ASBERGER'S AND I WOULD LIKE TO

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I THINK THAT A LOT OF KIDS HAVE

184
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
IT, AND I DON'T THINK IT HAS

185
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE

186
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
SITUATION AT ALL BECAUSE KIDS

187
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
WITH THAT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

188
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG.

189
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
>> SHE TALKED, NANCY TALKED

190
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
THROUGH THE YEARS ABOUT HER SON.

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
>> SHE CAME IN HERE AND WE

192
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
SOCIALIZED AND WENT OUT AND

193
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
NEVER TALKED ABOUT THE FAMILY.

194
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
SHE WAS -- SHE JUST CAME IN TO

195
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
HAVE A GREAT TIME, TO TALK,

196
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
AND --

197
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
>> GET IT OFF HER MIND IF

198
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
ANYTHING.
>> SHE DID BUT SHE WOULD ONLY

199
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
SAY IT HAS BEEN HARD FOR HER,

200
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
YOU KNOW, IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR

201
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
HER, BRINGING HIM UP AND SHE WAS

202
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
ALWAYS --

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
>> SHE TALKED ABOUT THE

204
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
CHALLENGE OF IT.
>> YEAH, BUT ALWAYS ON IT.

205
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
SHE WAS JUST SAYING, YEAH, NEVER

206
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO COME IN

207
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
HERE AND TALK ABOUT IT AND

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

209
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
SHE WOULD MENTION IT HAS BEEN

210
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
DIFFICULT AND SO MUCH FOR HIM TO

211
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
TRY TO GET HIM HELP HERE OR

212
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
THERE OR DOING DIFFERENT THINGS.

213
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD A

214
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
LOT ABOUT IS SHE WAS PASSIONATE

215
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
ABOUT GUNS AND COLLECTED GUNS.

216
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU KNEW ABOUT

217
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
OR SURPRISED WHEN YOU HEAR?

218
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
>> I WOULD SAY IN THE LAST THREE

219
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
YEARS OR SO SHE PICKED UP THE

220
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
HOBBY.
I DON'T KNOW WHO GOT HER INTO

221
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
IT.

222
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
SHE REALLY ENJOYED IT, TARGET

223
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
SHOOTING, SO I DIDN'T KNOW.

224
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I HAD NO IDEA.

225
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
>> NOT COLLECTING?

226
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
>> SHE WAS A TARGET SHOOTER.

227
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
SHE PROBABLY HAD SOME GUNS SHE

228
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
USED TO TAKE TO THE RANGE AND

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
PRACTICE WITH.

230
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE OWNED OR

231
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
WHAT SHE HAD.

232
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
SHE JUST SAID SHE ENJOYED IT AND

233
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
THAT WAS IT.

234
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF SHE TOOK HER

235
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
SONS, DIDN'T TAKE HER SONS, SHE

236
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT MUCH.

237
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I TOOK THIS UP, IT IS FUN, THAT

238
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
KIND OF THING.
>> GIVEN THAT YOU KNEW HER AS A

239
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
PERSON, WOULD YOU -- DO YOU

240
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
THINK SHE IS THE KIND OF

241
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
APPROXIMATE EARN THAT WOULD HAVE
THE GUNS AROUND THE HOUSE?

242
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
WOULD THEY BE LOCKED UP?

243
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
>> THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN LOCKED

244
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
UP.

245
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
>> SHE IS FAR TOO BRIGHT FOR

246
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
THAT.

247
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
SHE WAS VERY SMART.

248
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
SHE UNDERSTOOD.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK SOME OF THE

249
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
BIGGEST MISCONCEPTIONS ARE THAT

250
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
YOU HAVE HEARD ON THE NEWS?

251
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
>> I THINK MOSTLY BETWEEN THE

252
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
CONDITION HE HAD WHICH PEOPLE

253
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
COULD CONFUSE FOR BEING THE

254
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
REASON AND THE GUNS.

255
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I MEAN, WE DON'T THINK IT HAS

256
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER

257
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
CHARACTER.
>> DONATED HER TIME WITH ALL THE

258
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
CHARITABLE WORK AND HELPING

259
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
PEOPLE THAT NEEDED HELP AND

260
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
HELPING AIDS PEOPLE AND DONATING

261
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
MONEY AND FOR AIDS AND CHARITY
AND THAT'S WHAT SHE DID.

262
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
SHE DIDN'T GET PAID FOR DOING

263
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
WHAT SHE DID AND SHE DID ALL

264
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
CHARITABLE WORK AND ALL ON HER

265
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
OWN.
>> VERY GENEROUS.

266
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
>> VERY GENEROUS PERSON.

267
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
COULD BE SITTING HERE AND YOU

268
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
ARE TALKING TO HER AND THEY

269
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
WOULD BE SAYING I DON'T HAVE ANY

270
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
MONEY FOR THIS OR ANY MONEY FOR

271
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
THAT AND SHE WOULD TAKE HER

272
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
CHECKBOOK OUT AND WRITE A CHECK

273
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
AND GIVE IT TO THE PERSON

274
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
WITHOUT KNOWING THEM.
THAT'S THE KIND OF PERSON SHE

275
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
WAS.

276
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
>> ALL RIGHT.
I WANT TO BRING IN SUSAN

277
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
CANDIOTTI WITH THE LATEST ON THE

278
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
INVESTIGATION.
I KNOW WE WERE HEARING THOSE

279
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
FRIENDS OF NANCY LANZA TALKING

280
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
ABOUT HOW SHE PICKED UP THE

281
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
HOBBY OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS

282
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
AND THEY DON'T THINK SHE

283
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
WOULD -- THEY WERE VERY ADAMANT

284
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
SHE WOULDN'T BE THE PERSON THAT

285
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
WOULD LEAVE HER GUNS LOOSE.

286
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
SHE WOULD LOCK THEM UP WHAT ARE

287
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
YOU LEARNING ABOUT TARGET

288
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
SHOOTING, NANZ I LANZA AND ADAM?

289
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
>> IT IS ONE OF THE THINGS

290
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
INVESTIGATORS HAVE TO LOOK AT.

291
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
WHAT WERE BOTH DOING, IN

292
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
PARTICULAR HER SON?

293
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
THEY'RE FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT

294
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THAT.
THEY'RE LEARNING THAT IN FACT

295
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
BOTH MOTHER AND SON HAVE BEEN TO

296
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
TARGET PRACTICE AND DID GO TO

297
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
GUN RANGES AND SEVERAL TIMES

298
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

299
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW

300
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
OFTEN YET BUT MOST RECENTLY FOR

301
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
ADAM ANYWAY WAS IN THE LAST SIX

302
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
MONTHS, AND AGAIN OVER THE

303
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS.

304
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
THE REASON THEY DON'T KNOW THE

305
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
BIG PICTURE, THE FULL PICTURE

306
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
YET IS BECAUSE ATF IS STILL IN

307
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
THE PROCESS OF CANVASSING ALL OF

308
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
THE GUN RANGES IN THE AREA AND

309
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
THERE ARE A TON OF THEM IN

310
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
ADDITION TO LICENSED GUN DEALERS

311
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
TO TRY TO GET MORE INFORMATION

312
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
ABOUT THIS.
THEY'RE STILL FOLLOWING A LOT OF

313
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
LEADS, AND THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING

314
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
AT COMPUTERS, COMPUTERS THAT

315
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
THEY HAVE DISCOVERED IN THE

316
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
HOME, A COUPLE OF THEM WE HAVE

317
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
LEARNED FROM OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

318
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
OFFICIALS IS THAT THEY WERE

319
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
SMASHED, SMASHED TO SMITHEREENS.

320
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
>> TRYING TO DESTROY EVIDENCE.

321
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
>> IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE

322
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
CASE.
THAT'S THE APPARENT INDICATION.

323
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
NOW THEY HAVE TO PICK UP THE

324
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
PIECES LITERALLY AND TRY TO PULL

325
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
THINGS TOGETHER AND EXAMINE THE

326
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
HARD DRIVE WHAT WILL THEY LOOK

327
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
FOR?
THEY WILL BE CHECKING TO SEE IF

328
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
HE SENT E-MAILS TO ANYONE, WHAT

329
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
WEBSITES DID HE VISIT, WAS IN

330
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
CHAT ROOMS, MESSAGE BOARDS, ANY

331
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
INDICATION AS TO A POSSIBLE

332
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
MOTIVE IN ALL OF THIS.

333
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
WHO DID HE COMMUNICATE WITH IF

334
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
ANYONE?
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

335
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
THEY'RE LOOKING AT, AND REMEMBER

336
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
THEY ARE ALSO DOING A COMPLETE

337
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
HISTORY OF ALL OF THE WEAPONS

338
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
THAT WERE USED IN THIS TERRIBLE

339
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
TRAGEDY.

340
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
WE HAVE GOT THE ONE MADE BY

341
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
BUSHMASTER WHICH WAS THE ASSAULT

342
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
TYPE RIFLE, AND WE KNOW THAT HE

343
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
CAME ACCORDING TO OFFICIALS WITH

344
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
A TON OF AMMUNITION.

345
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
HE WAS ARMED TO THE HIT WHEN HE

346
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
WENT TO THAT SCHOOL, MULTIPLE

347
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
MAGAZINES.

348
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
>> HUNDREDS BULLETS.

349
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
>> EXTRA BULLETS ON TOP OF THAT,

350
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
30 ROUND MAGAZINES, A LOT TO GO

351
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
OVER, SO THEY'LL BE LOOKING AT

352
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
ALL OF THAT.

353
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
WE WERE ALSO THERE YESTERDAY

354
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
WHEN WE SAW HIS CAR BEING TOWED

355
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
AWAY.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE GOING OVER

356
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
THAT VEHICLE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM

357
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
INSIDE THE TRUNK, YOU WILL

358
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
REMEMBER, WAS AN EXTRA RIFLE.

359
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
>> I KNOW WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT

360
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
MOTIVE AND WHEN THEY GET THIS

361
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
INFORMATION THEY'LL GET MORE AND

362
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
MORE INFORMATION.

363
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIM

364
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
PLAYING VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES?

365
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
>> WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THAT

366
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
YET.
THAT'S ONE THING OF COURSE

367
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
THEY'LL BE LOOKING FOR, ANY

368
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000

WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THE

AND LATER THAT EVENING AS I SAT

461
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
DOWN I CONFRONTED A LOT OF MY

NORMALIZED THAT BEHAVIOR, WHAT I

477

TRIED TO DESCRIBE MICHAEL TO

PEOPLE, ANYONE THAT KNOWS HIM

479
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
KNOWS THAT 97% OF THE TIME HE IS

THIS ABSOLUTE RAGING -- I DON'T

485
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT.

486
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
YOU HAVE TO SEE IT TO BELIEVE
IT.

487
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I STOPPED AND SAID TO MYSELF

488

THIS ISN'T NORMAL.

489
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000

WHAT CAUSES HIM TO DO THIS?

497
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
HAS IT EVER BEEN DIAGNOSED?

DIAGNOSES.

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
IS DISAGREEMENT ON THAT AND ALSO

525
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000

526
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
REPEATEDLY JABBED HIS ELBOWS

527
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
INTO MY RIB CAGE.

528
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I AM STILL STRONGER THAN HE IS

529

BUT I WON'T BE FOR MUCH LONGER.

530
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
HOW LONG WILL HE BE IN THAT

532
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000

533
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000

WHERE YOU LIVE BUT WHERE WE LIVE

538
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT IS

539
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000

HERE.
THAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE

546
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
THAT I AM FACING, THE ADVICE I

547
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
GOT WAS I NEEDED TO PRESS

548
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
CHARGES SO THAT WE COULD CREATE

549
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
A PAPER TRAIL AGAIN AND HE DID

550
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
GET EXCELLENT FOLLOW THROUGH

551
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
CARE WHEN HE HAD TO DO JUVENILE

552
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
DETENTION AS A YOUNGER BOY, BUT

553
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE JAIL IS

554
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
THE RIGHT PLACE FOR MY SON, AND

555
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I AM JUST REALLY HOPING THAT WE

556
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
CAN FIND ANOTHER SOLUTION FOR

557
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
HIM.

558
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
>> YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR

559
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
WRITING THIS BLOG AND I KNOW

560
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
YOU'RE WELL AWARE THAT FAR AND

561
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
YOU WROTE IT UNDER YOUR OWN NAME

562
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
SO PEOPLE COULD FIGURE OUT WHO

563
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
YOUR SON IS AND I KNOW MICHAEL

564
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
ISN'T HIS REAL NAME AND ANYONE

565
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
THAT KNEW YOU COULD FIGURE IT

566
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
OUT.
YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR

567
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
DOING THAT.
MAYBE IF HE DOES GROW UP AND GET

568
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
THROUGH THIS AND IS ABLE TO

569
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
BECOME A FUNCTIONING MEMBER OF

570
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
SOCIETY THAT THIS WOULD DOG HIM

571
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE AND

572
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
YOUR WORDS WOULD BE THERE.

573
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?

574
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
>> THOSE KINDS OF CRITICISMS

575
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
WILL COME UP ANY TIME THERE IS A

576
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS.

577
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
FIRST AND FOREMOST, I REALIZE

578
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
THIS SOUNDS HOPELESSLY NAIVE

579
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
NOW.
DID I BELIEVE THAT MY BLOG WAS

580
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
ANONYMOUS, AND IF YOU LOOK AT

581
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
THE THE SOCCER MOM MY NAME IS

582
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
NOT ON THERE.

583
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
WHERE THE LINK CAME IS WITH IS

584
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
WHEN I PUBLISHED ON THE BLUE

585
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
REVIEW, AND THAT WAS LINKED TO

586
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
MY BLOG.
THAT, YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, AS YOU

587
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
PROBABLY KNOW, THERE IS A GREAT

588
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
WOMAN NAMED SARA OUT THERE WHO

589
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
HAS A WONDERFUL BLOG, VERY

590
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
ARTICULATE AND PASSIONATE AND

591
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT CHILDREN'S

592
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
PRIVACY ISSUES.

593
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
FRANKLY, ERIN, I THINK THEY ARE

594
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
CONCERNS ARE LEGITIMATE AND

595
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
CONCERNS ABOUT CHILDREN'S

596
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
PRIVACY ISSUES ARE LEGITIMATE.

597
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
MY SON DOES KNOW ABOUT THIS

598
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
PIECE.

599
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
HIS TAKE ON IT WAS, MOM, IF WE

600
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
CAN HELP PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND,

601
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
THEN THIS IS A GOOD THING.

602
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
>> LIZA, LET ME ASK YOU, YOU

603
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
MENTIONED SARA, AND OF COURSE

604
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
WHO YOU'RE REFERRING TO, SHE WAS

605
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
ANOTHER MOM, INCREDIBLY

606
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
SUPPORTIVE OF YOU AND YOU PUT

607
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
OUT A JOINT STATEMENT SAYING

608
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT

609
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

610
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
WHEN SHE POSTED ONLINE SOME OF

611
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
YOUR PRIOR BLOGS, I READ THEM.

612
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
YOU WROTE THINGS ABOUT YOUR

613
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
SON'S BEHAVIOR.

614
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
IT MAKES WANT TO THROTTLE YOU

615
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
AND I QUIT, LET THE STATE TAKE

616
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
CARE OF YOU AND ANOTHER TIME MY

617
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
DAY DREAMS INVOLVE MY DEATH OR

618
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
FEDERAL PRISON.

619
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
ARE THOSE THE RAW EMOTIONS YOU

620
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
FEEL AS A MOTHER AND MOST PEOPLE

621
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
DON'T SAY OR WERE YOU

622
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
EXAGGERATING OR TELL ME HOW THAT

623
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
HAPPENED.
>> WELL, I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL, I

624
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
HAVE TO ADMIT YOU GUYS HAVE ALL

625
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
SCRUTINIZED MY BLOG A WHOLE LOT

626
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
MORE THAN I EVER THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE SCRUTINIZED.

627
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN AMERICA

628
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
THINKS ANYONE READS THEIR BLOGS,

629
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
SO, YEAH, I THINK ONE OF THE

630
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
HALLMARKS OF MY WRITING AND ONE

631
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
OF THE REASONS THIS LAST PIECE

632
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
CONNECTED WITH SO MANY PEOPLE IS

633
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I DO HAVE A TENDENCY TO JUST

634
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
KIND OF SAY WHAT IS ON MY MIND,

635
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
AND I WROTE THOSE WORDS AND

636
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
THOSE ARE MY WORDS.

637
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I AM NOT DISOWNING THEM.

638
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A FOUR-YEAR --

639
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
THAT'S A FOUR-YEAR SLICE OF

640
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
HISTORY.
>> LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

641
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
DO YOU OWN A GUN?

642
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
>> HEAVEN'S NO, NO, NO, NO.

643
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
>> BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE

644
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
WRITING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH HERE
AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID YOU

645
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
HAVE FAIR POINTS, BUT YOU KNOW

646
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
DON'T LET THIS OBSCURE THE

647
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
NATIONAL DEBATE WE NEED TO HAVE

648
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
ABOUT GUN CONTROL AND WHAT WE

649
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
NEED TO DO.

650
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
>> OH, MY GOODNESS, NO.

651
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I HAVE CAUGHT THAT FROM MORE

652
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
THAN ONE PERSON AND I THINK THAT

653
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
THE LINE IN QUESTION IS

654
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
SOMETHING ABOUT IT IS EASY TO

655
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
TALK ABOUT GUN CONTROL AND IT IS

656
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
TIME TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH

657
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
AND IF I CAN CLARIFY WHAT I MEAN

658
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
BY EASY, IT IS THAT WE CAN FRAME

659
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
THE GUN CONTROL DEBATE IN TERMS

660
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
OF WRITE AND WRONG.

661
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
IT IS RIGHT TO HAVE GUN CONTROL

662
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
OR IT IS WRONG IF SOME PEOPLE

663
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
WOULD SAY TO HAVE GUN CONTROL,

664
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
SO THAT'S A SIMPLE WAY TO DEBATE

665
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
A QUESTION.

666
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SAY THAT

667
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
MENTAL HEALTH IS RIGHT OR WRONG.

668
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
>> YES.

669
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LIZA.

670
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE TIME

671
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
AND COMING AND TALKING ABOUT IN.

672
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
>> THANK YOU, ERIN.

673
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU

674
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
HIGHLIGHTING THIS IMPORTANT

675
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND I

676
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
JUST REALLY FEEL LIKE THIS IS A

677
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO

678
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
HAVE AS A NATION THAT WE NEED TO

679
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
DO SOMETHING FOR OUR CHILDREN

680
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
AND ADULTS WHO STRUGGLE WITH

681
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
BEHAVIORAL AND MENTAL HEALTH

682
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
ISSUES.
>> WE CERTAINLY DO.

683
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
THANKS.
>> THANK YOU.

684
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
>>> I ASKED LIZA WHY SHE PUT A

685
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
PICTURE UP OF HER SON ON HER

686
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
BLOG SINCE SHE CHANGED HIS NAME

687
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
AND WANTED TO PROTECT HIS PRAIF

688
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
PRIVACY AND SHE WAS VERY OPEN.

689
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
THE PICTURE IS AGE 7 AND HE

690
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THAT.

691
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I WANT TO BRING IN DR. SANJAY

692
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
GUPTA.

693
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
SANJAY, WHEN YOU HEAR THIS

694
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
STORY, AND YOU SEE LIZA TALKING

695
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
ABOUT HER CHILD AND HER

696
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
STRUGGLES, SHE HAS TAKEN A LOT

697
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
OF CRITICISM FOR THAT FROM A LOT

698
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
OF PEOPLE.

699
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> IT WAS A REALLY GOOD

700
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
INTERVIEW.
IT WAS INTERESTING.
YOU ALMOST GOT THE SENSE IT WAS

701
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
A LITTLE THERAPEUTIC FOR HER,

702
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
HER WRITING, SHE WRITES THIS

703
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
STUFF AND NOW SEEING HER AND

704
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
MEETING HER THROUGH THAT

705
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
INTERVIEW, YOU CAN TELL SHE IS

706
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
NOT THE KIND OF MOM TO DO THESE

707
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
THINGS BUT SHE IS FRUSTRATED.

708
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE, IMAGINE

709
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
THIS, THE THRESHOLD TO GET YOUR

710
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
CHILD TREATMENT IS THAT THEY

711
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
HAVE TO BE OF IMMINENT HARM TO

712
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
THEMSELVES OR OTHER PEOPLE.

713
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
IT IS LIKE SAYING YOU CAN OCHBL

714
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
GO TO THE 4079 IF YOU'RE ALREADY

715
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

716
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

717
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
THIS IS THE PROBLEM WHEN YOU

718
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
TALK ABOUT PUTTING MENTAL HEALTH

719
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
ON PAR WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH.

720
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
IT IS NOT RIGHT NOW.

721
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
>> IT IS HARD WHEN SHE SAID YOU

722
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
ARE PUT IN A POSITION YOU HAVE

723
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
TO CHARGE YOUR OWN CHILD WITH

724
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
BATTERY OR ASSAULT.

725
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
HER HUSBAND HAD TO DO THAT IN

726
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
ORDER TO GET HIM INTO JUVENILE

727
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
CARE.

728
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
HAVE YOU DONE THE NUMBERS.

729
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
1 IN 5 CHILDREN HAVE A MENTAL

730
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
HEALTH ISSUE IN THIS COUNTRY.

731
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
THAT'S AN AMAZING NUMBER.

732
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000

739
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000

ONE OF THE BOYS OUT OF THIS

1099

1102
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
STOPPED AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND

1103
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
HE SAID JUST SAYING YOUR HOUSE

1104
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000

00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
RIGHT THING TO DO.

1275
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I FELT LIKE I COULD HAVE AN

1276
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

1277
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE GRIEF THAT

1278
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
WE'RE FEELING AS A COMMUNITY AND

1279
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
WE FEEL NUMB.

1280
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
WE'RE CARRYING OUR GRIEF AROUND

1281
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
WITH US.

1282
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
WE HAVE THE THOUGHTS OF THE

1283
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
PARENTS WHO LOST THEIR CHILDREN

1284
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
IN OUR MINDS ALL THE TIME.

1285
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
IT IS HARD.

1286
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
EVERYTHING STOPPED NOW.

1287
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
IT IS HARD TO GET ON WITH YOUR

1288
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
ROUTINE.
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

1289
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE

1290
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
COFFEE WITHOUT FORGETTING WHAT I

1291
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
AM DOING HALFWAY THROUGH AND I

1292
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
JUST WANT TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT

1293
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
TO MY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS,

1294
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
ESPECIALLY THE ONES GRIEVING THE

1295
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
MOST WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES

1296
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
THAT WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER AND

1297
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
THAT THERE IS SO MUCH GOOD IN

1298
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
THE WORLD AND THAT WE'RE GOING

1299
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000

1300
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
>> I KNOW YOU WERE TELLING A

1301
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
PERSONAL STORY JUST ABOUT HOW IT

1302
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
IS HARD TO SLEEP.

1303
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
>> YEAH.

1304
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
>> WHEN YOU DOZED OFF LAST NIGHT

1305
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
AND WOKE UP, YOU HAD TO WAKE

1306
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000

1307
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000

1311
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
MENTIONED THAT TO FRIENDS OF

1312
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
MINE AND CAN THEY ALL COULD

1313
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
RELATE TO THAT.

1314
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE IT.

1315
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE WHEN

1316
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000

1317
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
BEAUTIFUL SPEECH LAST NIGHT AND

1318
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
HE LISTED THE MASSACRES THAT

1319
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
HAVE HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY AND

1320
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
THE TRAGIC EVENTS AND AT THE END

1321
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
OF IT CAME THE NAME OF OUR

1322
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
LITTLE TOWN THAT NO ONE ELSE

1323
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
USED TO -- I USED TO HAVE TO

1324
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
EXPLAIN WHERE IT WAS, AND THAT

1325
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
WAS SHOCKING.

1326
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000

1327
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
WAY.

1328
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE

1329
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
COLUMBINE.

1330
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
>> EXACTLY.
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO ASSOCIATE

1331
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
THE NAME OF OUR TOWN WITH THIS

1332
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.
OUR TOWN IS MORE THAN THAT.

1333
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
IT IS A REALLY SPECIAL PLACE

1334
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
WHERE PARENTS ARE SO COMMITTED

1335
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
TO THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION

1336
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
AND BRINGING THEM UP WELL AND MY

1337
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000

1338
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
MEMORIES OF SANDY HOOK.

1339
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
IT IS A HUGE PART OF THEIR

IT AS A CRIME SCENE.

1345
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
>> THIS IS A TOUGH QUESTION TO

1346
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
ASK GIVEN MY ROLE.
THE MEDIA, WHEN I WALK AROUND

1347

CARDIOVASCULAR WARNING.

1408
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
THEY ALL MAY INCREASE
THE CHANCE

1409
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
OF HEART ATTACK OR STROKE,
WHICH CAN LEAD TO DEATH.

1410
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
THIS CHANCE INCREASES
IF YOU HAVE HEART DISEASE

1411
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
OR RISK FACTORS
SUCH AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE

1412
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
OR WHEN NSAIDS ARE TAKEN
FOR LONG PERIODS.

OR STOMACH AND INTESTINE
PROBLEMS,

SUCH AS BLEEDING AND ULCERS,

AND MAY CAUSE DEATH.

STOMACH BLEEDING AND ULCERS.
