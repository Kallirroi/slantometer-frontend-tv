HER OLD BRA GAVE HER TOO MUCH

253
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
CLEAVAGE AND TOO LITTLE SUPPORT.

254
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000

SHE'S LIFTED, SUPPORTED

260
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
AND COMFORTABLE.

261
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
>> I WAS REALLY SURPRISED.

262
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I WAS LIKE, THERE'S NO WAY THAT

263
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
THIS BRA'S GOING TO GIVE ME

264
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
SUPPORT WITHOUT UNDERWIRE OR

265
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
ANYTHING, BUT THEN I PUT IT ON

266
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH."

267
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE NOT WEARING

268
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
A BRA, LIKE IT'S... IT'S REALLY,

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
CONFIDENCE AS WELL.

274
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
>> YEAH, BECAUSE YOU CAN WALK

275
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

276
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
ABOUT YOUR BOOBS BOUNCING...

277
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000

BUTTON-DOWN SHIRT?

285
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
NOT WITH THE MILANA BRA.

286
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
BATTLE SCARS FROM THE UNDERWIRE,

300
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
'CAUSE WHEN IT POKES OUT AFTER

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
YOU WASH IT TOO MANY TIMES...

302
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
AROUND, WE'RE GOING TO TURN YOU

304
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
AROUND AND I WANT EVERYBODY TO

529
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
>> I SAID IT BLOWS MY MIND.

530
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
[LAUGHTER]

531
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000

00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
SOME KIND OF ELASTIC.

537
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
IT JUST... DOESN'T COMPUTE.

538
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
>> IT REALLY IS ALL ABOUT THE

539
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
CONSTRUCTION.

540
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
WHEN YOU SAID--

612
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
>> I TRY NOT TO.

613
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
THAT'S A TOUGH THING, YEAH.

614
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
>> WELL, UNDERWIRES,

615
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

616
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000

WHAT HAPPENS IS EVENTUALLY,

620
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
IT HAS TO CAVE UNDER THE WEIGHT.

621
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
AND IT'S GOING COME POKE AND HOW

622
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000

>> Stella: NOW REMEMBER, WE USED

634
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
TAPE ON EACH OF THESE SIZE

635
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000

MILANA BRA.

642
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
>> NOW, DO YOU THINK THAT'S A

643
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
MEASURABLE DIFFERENCE?

644
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
REMEMBER, THIS IS WHERE THE APEX

645
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000

646
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
OLD BRA AND HERE IT IS IN A

647
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000

660
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
>> BUT LOOK AT THAT.

661
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
THAT IS A MEASURABLE DIFFERENCE.

662
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
WELL-ENDOWED, IT'S TOUGH

668
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
TO FIND A GOOD BRA.

669
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000

HAS IT ALL.

684
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
>> I DON'T HAVE TO CHECK TO SEE

685
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
IF THE TWINS ARE IN PLACE

686
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
BECAUSE I KNOW THEY ARE.

687
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000

ALONGSIDE HERE.

693
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I ALSO DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S

694
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
A BULGE ON THE SIDE AS WELL.

AVERAGE BRA COSTS ABOUT $60.

716
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
>> $60 FOR ONE UNCOMFORTABLE

717
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
BRA? >> YES.

>> UH, FOR SURE.

724
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
>> I COULD STOP AT TWO, BUT YOU

725
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
KNOW, THREE WOULD BE BETTER.

YOU SIT HERE AND YOU'RE BATTLING

1337
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000

1338
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
SO YOU HOIST THEM UP AND THEN IT

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
RIGHT? >> Terri: RIGHT.

1341
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I HAVE, THIS IS THE ONE

1368
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
BUTTON-DOWN SHIRT THAT I HAVE

1369
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
AND IT STILL, I MEAN,

1370
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
AS YOU CAN SEE.

1371
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
>> THE MILANA BRA'S GOING TO

1372
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
GIVE YOU THAT BEAUTIFUL LACE

00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
SUPPORT AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE

1374
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
LIFTED, BUT YOU'LL BE SURPRISED

1375
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
AT HOW THE BUTTON WON'T BE DOING

1376
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
THE BIG, GIANT STRETCH. >> GOOD.

1377
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000

>> Announcer: REMEMBER NUBIA?

1383
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
HER OLD BRA GAVE HER TOO MUCH

1384
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
CLEAVAGE AND TOO LITTLE SUPPORT.

1385
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
>> Terri: OH, MY GOSH!

1386
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000

IS COVERED.

1390
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
SHE'S LIFTED, SUPPORTED

1391
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
AND COMFORTABLE.

1392
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
>> I WAS REALLY SURPRISED.

1393
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I WAS LIKE, THERE'S NO WAY THAT

1394
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
THIS BRA'S GOING TO GIVE ME

1395
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
SUPPORT WITHOUT UNDERWIRE OR

1396
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
ANYTHING, BUT THEN I PUT IT ON

1397
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH."

1398
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE NOT WEARING

1399
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
A BRA, LIKE IT'S... IT'S REALLY,

1400

I WAS REALLY SURPRISED.

1402
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
>> SO, I JUST NOTICED YOU WALKED

1403
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
OUT WITH A BIT OF AIR OF

1404
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
CONFIDENCE AS WELL.

1405
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
>> YEAH, BECAUSE YOU CAN WALK

1406
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

1407
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
ABOUT YOUR BOOBS BOUNCING...

1408
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
[LAUGHTER] NOT THAT THEY BOUNCE

1409
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
IN MY FACE, BUT...

1410
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
>> Stella: YES, THEY WERE!

1411
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
>> Terri: YOU LOOK FANTASTIC,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1412
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000

REMEMBER THOSE GAPS IN HER

1415
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
BUTTON-DOWN SHIRT?

1416
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
NOT WITH THE MILANA BRA.

1417
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
>> TELL ME ABOUT THE SUPPORT,

1418
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
BECAUSE YOU ARE GIFTED.

1419
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
>> IT'S A LOT TO CARRY AROUND

1420
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
AND I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GONNA

1421
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
SUPPORT, BUT IT DOES.

1422
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I FEEL LIFTED, I DON'T FEEL LIKE

1423
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'M WEARING A BRA.

1424
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
THERE'S NO DIGGING.

1425
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
>> IT USED TO HURT YOUR

1426
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
SHOULDERS, DIDN'T IT?

1427
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
>> YEAH, YEAH. >> RIGHT?

1428
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
HOW'S THAT FEEL FOR YOU NOW?

1429
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
>> THIS IS GREAT, I HAVE NO

1430
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
BATTLE SCARS FROM THE UNDERWIRE,

1431
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
'CAUSE WHEN IT POKES OUT AFTER

1434
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
AROUND, WE'RE GOING TO TURN YOU

1435
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
AROUND AND I WANT EVERYBODY TO

1436
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
SEE THIS.

1437
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
YOU SEE THIS?

1438
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
>> Announcer: BEFORE THE MILANA

BACK FAT.

1441
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
THEN SHE PUT ON THE MILANA BRA

1442
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
AND LOOK-- NO MORE.

00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
AND IN A BRA WITH ANY KIND OF

1446
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
HOOKS WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE

1447
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
CREATED ALL THOSE LUMPS.

1448
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
>> Terri: ESPECIALLY WHEN

INVENTED BY A MAN, DON'T YOU?

00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
THE MILANA BRA.

1648
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
NO WIRES, NO HOOKS.

00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
IT GIVES YOU THE LIFT,

1650
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
THE EVEN BAND HERE.

1651
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
THERE'S NO BACK FAT HAPPENING.

1652
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
THE STRAPS AREN'T SLIPPING.

1653
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
THERE'S NO METAL ON THE

1654
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
STRAPS EITHER.

1655
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000

I WEAR A DOUBLE D, 42 DD, AND I

1666
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000

SOME KIND OF ELASTIC.

1670
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
