1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
GRANDMA HAS GOT A JILLION
CHRISTMAS CARDS TO SEND,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
AND IT WOULD BE
REALLY HELPFUL

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
IF YOU WOULD TAKE
THESE REINDEER STAMPS,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
AND PUT THEM ON--
NO, THANK YOU.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
OH, SURE. NO ONE WANTS TO KNOW
HOW THE SAUSAGE IS MADE.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
WHOA! HEY!
HOLD ON, LITTLE MAN.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
WATCH OUT. YOUR HEAD IS

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
AT A VERY DANGEROUS HEIGHT
RIGHT NOW.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
SO?
I HEARD THERE WAS SAUSAGE.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
ARE WE FINALLY DONE
WITH THAT STUPID TURKEY?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
NOPE.
MOM'S STILL PHONING IT IN.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
COME ON.
IT'S A HOLIDAY LOGJAM, MIKE.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
HALLOWEEN, THANKSGIVING,
CHRISTMAS.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
AND SURVIVING ALL THAT
IS THE REAL REASON

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I ALLOW MYSELF TO BE
OVER-SERVED NEW YEAR'S EVE.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
YOU GOTTA LEARN
TO PACE YOURSELF, HONEY.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
THEN YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY
GET TO SEE THAT BALL DROP.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
(chuckles)

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
BEEN WATCHING 'EM DROP
FOR YEARS, DEAR.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'VE BEEN WATCHING
STUFF DROP, TOO.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
TOUCHE.
HONEY, COME HERE.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
YOU WANNA HELP ME
WITH SOME OF THIS STUFF?

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'VE GOT ALL THIS--
YEAH, I'M SORRY
I HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND MORE.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
IT'S BEEN INSANE
AT THE STORE.
YEAH?

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
OBAMA'S ECONOMY'S
HELPING OUT.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
LOT OF PEOPLE CAMPING
THESE DAYS.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
MOSTLY UNDER BRIDGES.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
HEY, MANDY, COME HERE, HONEY.
I NEED SOME HELP WITH CHRISTMAS.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
YEAH, I'M ALREADY
DOING MY PART

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
BY GOING AWAY TO CANCUN
WITH ALL MY FRIENDS.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
PLUS I PRE-REGISTERED
FOR ALL MY GIFTS ONLINE.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
HEY--
OOH, AND IF YOU ORDER TODAY,
FREE SHIPPING.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
YOU'RE WELCOME.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
KRIS, HE'S WITH
YOUR FOLKS ALL THE TIME.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
HE'S NEVER EVEN
MET MY PARENTS.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
WHY IS IT THAT EVERY TIME
I SAY "NO," YOU DON'T LISTEN?

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
THERE'S A WINDOW
INTO HOW WE GOT BOYD.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
(mouths words)

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
RYAN WANTS TO TAKE BOYD
AWAY FOR THE HOLIDAYS...

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
TO CANADA.

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
WHAT? NO, NO, NO, NO. NO.
NOT--NOT CHRISTMAS.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
CHRISTMAS IS A TIME
FOR FAMILY, LOVE, AND AFFECTION.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
SO SCREW YOU.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
MY FOLKS HAVE A BIG PLACE
UP IN WINNIPEG

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
WITH A FROZEN POND OUT BACK.

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I CAN TEACH BOYD
HOW TO SKATE.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
WHAT IF BOYD CRACKS
HIS HEAD OPEN ON THE ICE?

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
CANADA. FREE HEALTH CARE.

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
NO, HE'S GONNA HAVE
A TRADITIONAL,

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED
AMERICAN CHRISTMAS

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
WHILE HE'S STILL
YOUNG ENOUGH TO ENJOY IT,

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
NOT ALL JADED AND GREEDY
LIKE THIS CREW.

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
HEY. I'M NOT GREEDY.

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I JUST BELIEVE THE BABY JESUS

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
WOULD WANT ME
TO HAVE AN iPad.

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
-- Captions by VITAC --

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
HERE YOU GO.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
(rips)

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
SORRY. THAT'S PROBABLY
MY FAULT.

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'LL WRAP THAT FOR YOU.
COME BACK IN A BIT.

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
KYLE, YOU GOTTA REMEMBER--
WITH TAPE, SHINY SIDE UP,

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
STICKY SIDE DOWN.

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
VANESSA'S BEEN REALLY
WORKING HARD.

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I WANNA GET HER SOMETHING
SPECIAL FOR CHRISTMAS,

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
LET HER KNOW THAT SHE'S
REALLY APPRECIATED.

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE.

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
PERFECT GIFT. ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVE A DOG, RIGHT?

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
MUFFIN?
VANESSA LOVES THIS DOG?

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
WE ALL DO.
OKAY, GOOD.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
GO HOME, KIDNAP THE DOG.

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
YEAH. (mutters) JUST--
JUST HIDE IT SOMEWHERE.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT--
WRITE DOWN WHERE YOU HID IT.

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
VANESSA'S GONNA THINK
IT'S LOST.

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
SHE'S DISTRAUGHT. SHE PUTS UP
SIGNS ALL OVER THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
ED.
ALL RIGHT?
AT THE RIGHT TIME...

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
ED.
YOU FIND MUFFIN, ALL RIGHT?

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
YOU WRAP A BIG--WRAP A BIG
RED BOW AROUND HIS NECK,

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
AND IT'S A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE.
YOU'RE A HERO. THAT'S IT.

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
PLEASE, GOD, TELL ME
YOU HAVEN'T DONE THIS BEFORE.

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
MY ONLY MISTAKE WAS DOING IT
TWICE WITH THE SAME WIFE.

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
HEY. HI. HI.
HI, BABY.

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
HI, HONEY. HOW--
HELLO, MY DEAR.
HEY, ED, HOW ARE YOU?

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
HOW ARE YOU? GOOD.
UH, SO I WAS JUST
OUT SHOPPING.

87
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
AND SEE THAT SLED
YOU PICKED OUT FOR BOYD.

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
OH, OH, OH, IT'S
ON DISPLAY HERE. COME ON.
YEAH? ALL RIGHT.

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
YEAH, MUST BE TOUGH, HUH?
BEING OUT THERE ALL DAY,

91
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
AWAY FROM
YOUR BELOVED DOGGIE, HMM?

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
(mouths words)

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'M JUST PLANTING THE SEED!
(speaks indistinctly)

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
HEY, IF MR. ALZATE COMES BY,
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING HIM

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
THAT I TAUGHT YOU
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW?

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
(rips)

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
OH, AND DO YOU MIND

98
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
TEACHING ME
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW?

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
KYLE, THIS CAN'T BE TAUGHT.

100
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
IT'S SO SIMPLE,

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
IT LITERALLY CANNOT
BE TAUGHT.

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
IT'S POLYCARBONATE-BASED.

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
IT'S GOT A NYLON SEAT
FOR THE KID.

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
STEERABLE.
GERMAN ENGINEERING.

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
IT'S ABSOLUTELY
THE COOLEST THING.
HMM.

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
"TODES SCHLITTER"?

107
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

108
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
"DEATH SLED."

109
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'M GONNA KEEP LOOKING.
ALL RIGHT.

110
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THINK YOU'RE MAKING
A MISTAKE.

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
BUT WHATEVER YOU GET,
WE'RE GONNA BUY HERE IN AMERICA.

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE RYAN THOUGHT

113
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
WE'D LET HIM...
TAKE BOYD TO CANADA?

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
YEAH, YEAH.
THAT WAS SOMETHIN', HUH?

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
BOY, WASN'T IT?
YEAH.

116
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
WHAT?

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
OH, NO, NOTHING.
JUST, UM...

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
WHEN, UH, WHEN RYAN
ASKED IF HE COULD TAKE BOYD,

119
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THERE WAS A TINY
LITTLE PART OF ME

120
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
THAT KIND OF WENT, "YAY!"

121
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
WH... REALLY?

122
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
JUST A NICE,
NO-FUSS CHRISTMAS.

123
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
YOU--HONEY, YOU KNOW THIS
HAPPENS TO YOU EVERY YEAR.

124
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE
OUT OF SORTS.

125
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
AS SOON AS YOU HEAR
YOUR FAVORITE SONG,

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
"THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY"--

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
♪ PA RUM PA PUM PUM

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
YOU KNOW, YOU GET IT BACK.

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
YEAH, MAYBE. MAYBE.

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I JUST KEEP THINKING
ABOUT HOW SIMPLE CHRISTMAS WAS

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
WHEN IT WAS JUST
YOU AND ME, YOU KNOW?

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
A LITTLE APARTMENT
ON LEETSDALE DRIVE, REMEMBER?

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
YEAH, I DO. SURE, I DO.
YEAH.

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
WE'D SLEEP IN,
THEN GO TO CHURCH.

135
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'D SLEEP IN CHURCH.
YEAH. (sighs)

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
GOD, IT WAS SO QUIET,
WE COULD HEAR

137
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
WHEN THE UPSTAIRS NEIGHBOR
FELL TO THE FLOOR.
YEAH.

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
CHRISTMAS STROKE.

139
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
"OH!" (imitates thud)

140
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
(laughs)
AND REMEMBER?

141
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
THE E.M.S. GUYS
SHOWED UP IN SANTA HATS.

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
INAPPROPRIATE. I REALLY DID.
YEAH.

143
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
GOOD TIMES. GOOD TIMES.
YEAH, GOOD TIMES, YEAH.

144
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
SO YOU, UH, WANNA DO
CHRISTMAS WITHOUT THE KIDS?

145
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
UH, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

146
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I CAN'T EVEN
IMAGINE CHRISTMAS

147
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
WITHOUT KRISTIN AND MANDY
AND EVE AND BOYD, AND...

148
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
BOYD, RIGHT, RIGHT.

149
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
YEAH. JUST... THE HOUSE
WOULD BE SO EMPTY.

150
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
(clicks tongue)
QUIET. YEAH.

151
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
(clicks tongue)

152
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
YEAH, I MEAN, IF YOU WERE UNDER
THE TREE, I'D UNWRAP YOU.

153
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
(both laugh)

154
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'M GONNA PUT YOU
ON THE "NAUGHTY" LIST.
(laughs)

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
(laughs) OH...
OKAY. THAT'D BE FUN, YEAH.
THAT'D BE--

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
WELL, WE GOT
A LITTLE, UH...
YEAH.

157
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
OH. HONEY...

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

159
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
WELL, I GOTTA GO
WAIT IN LINE AT THE HAM STORE.

161
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT'S CODE FOR, BUT I'M IN.

162
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
(thud)

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
FINALLY GIVING THAT BIRD
A RESPECTABLE SEND-OFF?

164
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'VE GIVEN THIS BIRD
A RESPECTABLE SEND-OFF

165
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
EVERY MORNING ABOUT 8:05.

166
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
HEY, THANKS FOR SUPPORTING ME
WITH RYAN, BY THE WAY.

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
SOME NERVE OF THAT GUY,

168
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
THINKING HE COULD TAKE
BOYD OUT OF THE COUNTRY

169
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
TO WANNABE-AMERICA
FOR CHRISTMAS.

170
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
ON THE OTHER HAND,
MAYBE BOYD WOULD LIKE IT THERE.

171
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
THEY GOT MOUNTIES,
THEY GOT MAPLE SYRUP,

172
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
THEY GOT, UM... WELL...

173
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
YOU CAN GOOGLE IT. I'M SURE
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF UP THERE

174
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THAT KIDS LIKE.

175
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'M ALL FOR
THE VOGELSONS MEETING BOYD.

176
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY IT HAS TO BE AT CHRISTMAS.

177
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
YEAH, LET 'EM SPEND TIME
WITH THEIR OTHER GRANDCHILDREN.

178
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
NO, RYAN'S AN ONLY CHILD.

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
REALLY?

180
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
SO THEY LOOKED AT HIM
AFTER HE WAS BORN AND SAID,

181
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
"CAN'T DO BETTER
THAN THAT, EH?"

182
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
WAIT, SHOULD I--
SHOULD I HAVE LET BOYD GO?

183
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
GO WHERE?

184
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
OH, KRIS IS HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS

185
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
ABOUT BOYD GOING TO CANADA.

186
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
WHAT KIND OF MOM
WOULD THAT MAKE ME?

187
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
NOT BEING
WITH MY KID AT CHRISTMAS?

188
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
UM, IT'S, UH,
NOT THE MOST TERRIBLE THING

189
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'VE EVER... HEARD.

190
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
YEAH. IF THERE'S SOME WAY
THAT YOU COULD DO IT

191
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
WHERE YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE TO BE SEPARATED,

192
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
YOU COULD, UH...
WELL, YOU COULD GO WITH HIM.

193
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
SERIOUSLY?

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
GOT PLENTY OF ROOM UP THERE.

195
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
CANADIANS DON'T SHUT UP
ABOUT THEIR WIDE-OPEN SPACES.

196
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
NO, I DON'T WANT TO
RUIN YOUR GUYS' CHRISTMAS.

197
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
OH, HEY, COME ON.
IT'S GONNA BE QUIET,

198
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
BUT WE'RE GONNA BE FINE HERE.
WE REALLY WILL.

199
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
(mouths word)

200
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
ALL RIGHT. I GUESS I'LL GO
CHECK INTO SOME FLIGHTS.

201
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
YEAH, CHECK--
YEAH, SURE, JUST CHECK IN.

202
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
SEE HOW--YEAH, THAT'D BE
ALL RIGHT, RIGHT, HONEY?

203
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
SHOULD BE... (mouths words)

204
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
(both laughing)

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
(lowered voice) YOU'RE DOING IT!
YOU'RE DOING IT!
QUIET! QUIET! QUIET!

206
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE ACTUALLY
BUMPING OFF THE KIDS.
(whispers) QUIET.

207
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
(normal voice) MERRY CHRISTMAS.
IT'S YOUR PRESENT.
OHH!

208
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
(normal voice) NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS NOT GOOD.

209
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
HONEY--
THIS IS WRONG. I DON'T
FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS.

210
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I DON'T WANT TO--
HONEY, YOUR HANDS ARE CLEAN.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

211
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
WE GOT MANDY
TAKEN CARE OF.
YEAH.

212
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
KRISTIN AND BOYD.

213
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
JUST GOT ONE MORE KID
TO GET RID OF.

214
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
EVE.

215
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
NO NAMES. NO NAMES.

216
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
THE LESS YOU KNOW,
THE BETTER.

217
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
BUT SHE'S GONNA
BE A PROBLEM.

218
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
ALL RIGHT, LET ME THINK OF
SOMETHING. HOLD ON A SECOND.

219
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE. HO--

220
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
YOU DIDN'T HEAR THIS FROM ME,
BUT....

221
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
THE GOLDSTEINS INVITED EVE

222
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
TO GO WITH THEM TO ASPEN
OVER THE HOLIDAYS,

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
BUT SOMEONE INSISTED THAT SHE
NEEDED TO WORK AT OUTDOOR MAN.

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I KNOW SOMEBODY
WHO KNOWS SOMEBODY

225
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
WHO CAN MAKE THAT GO AWAY.

226
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
(chuckles)

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
NO MUSS, NO FUSS?

228
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
LIKE IT NEVER EVEN HAPPENED.

229
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
LET'FOR AN IDEA.S -

230
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
A GRAND IDEA CALLED AMERICA.

231
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
THE IDEA THAT
IF YOU WORK HARD,

232
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
IF YOU HAVE A DREAM,

233
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
IF YOU WORK WITH
YOUR NEIGHBORS...

234
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
YOU CAN DO MOST ANYTHING.

235
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THIS LED TO OTHER IDEAS

236
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
LIKE LIBERTY

237
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
IT PUT A MAN ON THE MOON

242
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
AND A PHONE IN YOUR POCKET.

243
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
OUR COUNTRY'S GONE THROUGH A LOT
OVER THE CENTURIES AND A HALF.

244
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
BUT THIS IDEA ISN'T FRAGILE.

245
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
WHEN TIMES GET TOUGH,
IT RALLIES US AS ONE.

246
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
EVERY DAY, MORE PEOPLE
BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN IDEA

247
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
AND WHEN THEY DO,
THE DREAM COMES TRUE.

248
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
WE'RE GRATEFUL
TO BE A PART OF IT.

249
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's a morning breeze
smooth as Black Silk.

250
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
With Folgers Gourmet Selections
K-Cup packs

251
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You can turn any day gourmet.

252
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
New roasts, a new look...

253
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
available
where you buy groceries.

254
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
[ Male Announcer ]
WATCH OUT, CASANOVA.

255
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
THERE'S A NEW LADIES' MAN

256
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000

Walgreens DURING THE HOLIDAYS.

JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW,

268

I FIRED EVE
LIKE YOU TOLD ME TO.
OH.

269
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
SHE DIDN'T TAKE IT WELL.

270
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
SHE SAID SOME THINGS.

271
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
SCARY THINGS.

272
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
WOULD YOU MIND
WALKING ME TO MY CAR LATER?

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
MIKE, I'VE DONE
A TERRIBLE THING.

274
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
WHAT'S UP, ED?

275
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
UH, KYLE, CLOSE THE DOOR.

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
ALL RIGHT, LOOK...

MAY SICKEN YOU.

279
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
PLEASE TELL ME YOU DIDN'T
KIDNAP MY DOG.

280
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
NO. SWEAR ON YOUR LIFE
YOU'LL TELL NO ONE.

281
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
YEAH, YEAH, NOTHIN'.
WHAT IS IT, ED?
NO--OKAY. OKAY.

282
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
(plastic crackles)

283
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
YOU SHOT A BALD EAGLE.

284
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
YEP. THAT'S HIM,
ALL RIGHT.

285
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
OH...
I'M SO ASHAMED

286
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
FOR THE CRIME I'VE COMMITTED
AGAINST MY COUNTRY.

287
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
ON THE OTHER HAND,
I BAGGED A FRIGGIN' EAGLE.

288
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
GOOD GOIN', ED.

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
I HAD THE TURKEY IN MY SIGHTS.

290
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I WAS ABOUT TO
SQUEEZE OFF A SHOT

291
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
WITH MY S20 TURKEY THUMPER

292
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
WHEN THIS...
BALD IDIOT SWOOPS IN.

293
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
YOU'RE GONNA
GET FINED FOR THIS, ED.

294
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
OH, THEY HAVE TO
CATCH ME FIRST.

295
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
THAT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD.

296
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
IT'S GOT A GPS
AROUND ITS NECK.

297
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
THEY'RE STILL
TAGGING EAGLES?

298
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
THEY'RE NOT EVEN
ENDANGERED ANYMORE.

299
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
UNLESS YOU'RE NEARBY
WITH A TURKEY THUMPER.

300
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
YOU GOTTA
GET BALDY OUT OF HERE.

301
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'M ON IT.
YEAH.

302
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
COME WITH ME, MR. ALZATE.

303
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
NO! (shouts indistinctly)

304
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
HE'S TALKING
ABOUT THE EAGLE.

305
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
WE HAVE TO DISPOSE OF THIS
PROPERLY.

306
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I KNOW A PLACE
WE CAN DUMP THIS.

307
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
HOLD DOWN THE STORE.

308
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
NO PROBLEM.

309
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
ACTUALLY, ONCE ONE OF THESE
TOUCHES THE GROUND,

310
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO
BURN IT?

311
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
THAT'S FOR FLAGS,
YOU BONEHEAD.

312
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO SHOT AN EAGLE.

313
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
SO, MANDY'S OFF
TO MEXICO IN A WEEK.

314
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000

CHRISTMAS WITH THE GOLDSTEINS
IN ASPEN.

319
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000

323
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S GONNA BE
JUST THE TWO OF US.
I KNOW.

324
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
GOSH, I SHOULDN'T HAVE
BOUGHT A 20-POUND HAM.

325
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.

326
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
NO, YOU HAVE TO GO
TO CANCUN.
I AM NOT GOING.

327
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T GO,
NONE OF US CAN GO,

328
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
AND I WILL HAVE TO
STAY HOME WITH MY FAMILY,

329
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
WHICH WILL SUCK.

330
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'LL HANDLE THIS.
YOU DON'T KNOW NUTTIN'.

331
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I DON'T KNOW NUTTIN'.

332
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
GIRLS, GIRLS, GIRLS,

333
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000

DARED YOU TO DO IT?

HAVE A CRUSH ON STEVE.
