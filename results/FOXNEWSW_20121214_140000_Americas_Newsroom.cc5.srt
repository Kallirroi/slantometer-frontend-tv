22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN ON THE

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
RESPONSE TO TERROR ATTACKS

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
IN BENGHAZI.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
SOME WONDER WHETHER OR NOT

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000

FOR MARTHA TODAY.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
SHE WANTS TO AVOID A VOTE,

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
LENGTH I, DISRUPTIVE AND

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
COSTLY CONFIRMATION PROCESS.

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
CRITICS SAY REGARDLESS OF

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
RYCE'S DECISION THE

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
INVESTIGATION INTO BENGHAZI

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
WILL CONTINUE.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
HERE IS LINDSEY GRAHAM ON

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
THAT.
>> I HOLD HER ACCOUNTABLE

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
AND RESPONSIBLE FOR

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
MISLEADING THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
FAILURES ON THE INTELLIGENCE

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
COMMUNITY.
THERE IS FOG OF WAR

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
COMPONENT.

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I THINK SHE WAS CHOSEN FOR A

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
REASON

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
BILL: STILL MORE ON THAT

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
STATEMENT NOW WITH BUY ON

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL

53

CORRESPONDENT FOR THE

"WASHINGTON EXAMINER".

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
SO MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN.

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
FIRST OFF WHY DID THEY MAKE

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
THIS MOVE NOW?

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
>> BECAUSE TIME WAS RUNNING

60
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
OUT AND THE ADMINISTRATION,

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I THINK, HOPED THAT

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
OPPOSITION AMONG REPUBLICANS

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
IN THE SENATE TO RICE WOULD

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
DIMINISH BUT IT DIDN'T.

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
THE THING THAT REALLY KILLED

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
IT, THEY UNDERSTOOD, JOHN

67
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
McCAIN, LINDSEY GRAHAM,

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
KELLY AYOTTE OPPOSED HER.

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
THE THING THAT KILLED IT

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
WHEN SHE MET SUSAN COLLINS

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
WHO INTRODUCED HER AT HER

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
CONFIRMATION HEARING AND

73
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
BEEN A RISE SUPPORTER AND

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
SAID THERE WERE SERIOUS

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

76
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
NOMINATION.
AT THAT POINT THE

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
HANDWRITING WAS ON THE WALL.

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
BILL: SHE IS CONSIDERED A

79
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
MODERATE, IF YOU HAVE A GOOD

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
CHANCE OF GETTING THROUGH

81
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
THAT WOULD BE THE SIGN YOU

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
HAVE A CHANCE BUT WHAT

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
GRAHAM JUST SAID, SHE WAS

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
THE MOST POLITICALLY

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
COMPLIANT PERSON THEY COULD

86
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
FIND, THAT'S LOADED.

87
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
>> WELL I MEAN THIS GOES

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
BACK TO WHAT SHE SAID IN THE

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
AFTERMATH OF THOSE BENGHAZI

90
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
ATTACKS WHEN SHE SAID IT

91
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
WASN'T A TERRORIST ACT.

92
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
IT WAS THE RESULT OF

93
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
SPONTANEOUS PROTESTS AGAINST

94
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
THAT ISLAMIC VIDEO.

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
WE KNOW THAT SUSAN RICE WAS

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
PICKED IN PART BECAUSE OF

97
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
HER INTENSE LOYALTY TO

98
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
NOT LIKE SHE IS THE

99
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
BEST-LOVED PERSON IN

100
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
WASHINGTON.
IT IS THE FACT SHE HAS BEEN

101
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
WITH THE PRESIDENT FOR QUITE

102
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
A WHILE.

103
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
SHE WAS A CLINTON PERSON AND

104
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
WENT WITH OBAMA EARLY IN

105
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
2006 AND 2007.

106
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
THERE IS A LOT OF LOYALTY

107
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THERE AND THE PRESIDENT

108
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
COULD COUNT ON HER.

109
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
BILL: WITHIN A WEEK, YOU

110
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
WERE FIVE DAYS WHEN YOU SAW

111
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
SUSAN RICE IN THE FOLLOWING

112
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
IMAGE.

113
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
FIVE DIFFERENT SUNDAY TALK

114
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
SHOWS ON EVERY NETWORK ON

115
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
THAT SUNDAY.

116
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
NOW HERE IS PART OF THE

117
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
INTERVIEW ON "FOX NEWS

118
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
SUNDAY" WHERECHRIS WALLACE

119
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
STARTED ALL OF THIS TOO,

120
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
LISTEN.

121
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
>> WHAT HAPPENED INITIALLY

122
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
IT WAS A SPONTANEOUS

123
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
REACTION TO WHAT HAD JUST

124
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
TRANSPIRED IN CAIRO.

125
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE

126
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
VIDEO.

127
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
PEOPLE GATHERED OUTSIDE THE

128
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
EMBASSY AND THEN IT GREW

129
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
VERY VIOLENT.

130
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
BILL: AS A CONSEQUENCE OF

131
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
THE VIDEO.

132
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
DO WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

133
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
BENGHAZI NOW?

134
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
>> WELL, REPUBLICANS ARE

135
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
CERTAINLY GOING TO KEEP

136
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
TRYING.

137
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
HILLARY CLINTON WHO HAD A

138
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
MUCH BIGGER ROLE IN ALL THIS,

139
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
WILL TESTIFY BEFORE THE

140
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
HOUSE AND THE SENATE SOON

141
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
BUT I TELL YOU THEY'RE VERY

142
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
FRUSTRATED.
REPRESENTATIVE JASON

143
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
CHAFFETZ WHO IS HELPING LEAD

144
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
THIS INVESTIGATION IN THE

145
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
HOUSE, WANTS TO TALK TO A

146
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE

147
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
SURVIVORS OF THIS ATTACK.

148
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
IT IS NOT JUST THAT

149
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
AMBASSADOR STEVENS AND THREE

150
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
OTHERS WERE KILLED, SEVERAL

151
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
OTHERS WERE INJURED AND THEY

152
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
HAVE INFORMATION.

153
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
HE CAN NOT GET IN CONTACT

154
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
WITH THEM.

155
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
THERE IS LOT OF CONFLICT

156
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
BETWEEN REPUBLICANS ON THE

157
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
HILL AND THE ADMINISTRATION

158
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
THAT HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED.

159
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
BILL: THAT IS AN INTERESTING

160
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
POINT.
ALL THE PEOPLE HAVE A STORY.

161
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR

162
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000

163
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000

EXPECTED TO MEET WITH THE

167
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
PRESIDENT PRIVATELY TODAY.

168
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VOCAL

169
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
FOR HER AND BLASTING

170
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000

HE CALLS UNFAIR AND

172
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
MISLEADING ATTACKS ON RICE.

AMBASSADOR RICE EVEN BEFORE

178
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
SHE TOOK HER NAME OUT OF

179
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
PUBLIC CONTENTION.

180
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
NOW THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS

201
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000

THIS.

208
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
BILL: WHAT DO YOUING THIS

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
WEEKEND, HUH?

210
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
WHAT IS JOHN BOEHNER DOING

211
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
THIS WEEKEND?

212
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND

213
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA MET

214
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
FACE-TO-FACE FOR A 50 MINUTE

215
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
MEETING LATE YESTERDAY

216
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
AFTERNOON.
THE TWO MEN SPOKE FOR ABOUT

217
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
AN HOUR.
AS SPEAKER BOEHNER LEFT THE

218
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
CAPITOL HE SAID, QUOTE,

219
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
WE'RE DOING GREAT.

220
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
BEFORE THAT MEETING THE

221
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
PRESIDENT DID A ROUND OF

222
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
LOCAL TV INTERVIEWS AND TOLD

223
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
A REPORTER THE FOLLOWING.

224
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
LISTEN HERE.

225
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
>> THE BIG PROBLEM RIGHT NOW

226
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
IS THAT REPUBLICANS IN THE

227
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
HOUSE ARE RESISTANT TO THE

228
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
IDEA OF THE WEALTHIEST

229
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
AMERICANS PAYING HIGHER TAX

230
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
RATES AND I UNDERSTAND THEY

231
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL

232
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
OBJECTION.

233
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU KNOW,

234
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
WE'RE WILLING TO MAKE SOME

235
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
REALLY TOUGH DECISIONS ABOUT

236
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
SPENDING CUTS.
BILL: WELL, IT'S BOEHNER

237
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
PLAN FOR THE WEEKEND MAYBE

238
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
THE REAL SIGN OF ANY

239
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
PROGRESS.

240
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT HE IS

241
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
DOING AND TALK TO "FOX NEWS

242
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
SUNDAY" ANCHOR CHRIS WALLACE

243
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
ON THAT COMING UP A BIT

244
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
LATER THIS MORNING.
ALISYN: FOX NEWS ALERT FOR

245
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
YOU NOW BECAUSE DEFENSE

246
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
SECRETARY LEON PANETTA

247
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
ANNOUNCING THAT THE U.S. IS

248
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
SENDING PATRIOT MISSILES AND

249
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
TROOPS TO TURKEY TO DEAL

250
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WITH THE GROWING THREAT FROM

251
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
THE NEIGHBORING SYRIA.

252
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
400 TROOPS WILL JOIN NATO

253
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
FORCES AND STAND READY TO

254
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
ACT IF SYRIA INTENDS TO

255
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
UNLEASH CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

256
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
FOX'S LELAND VITTERT IS IN

257
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
OUR MIDDLE EAST BUREAU.

258
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
LELAND, JUST A FEW DAYS AGO

259
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
THE HEAD OF NATO SAID THE

260
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
ASSAD REGIME IS ABOUT TO

261
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
COLLAPSE.

262
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
WHY DEPLOY THESE TROOPS NOW?

263
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
>> Reporter: IT REALLY HAS

264
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
TO DO WITH SHOWING

265
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
SOLIDARITY WITH THE TURKS

266
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
WHO ARE CLEARLY VERY SCARED

267
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
AND TIMING COMES A COUPLE

268
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
DAYS AFTER WE LEARNED THAT

269
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
THE SYRIANS WERE MIXING

270
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO POSSIBLY

271
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
USE.
SO THIS IS THE UNITED STATES

272
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
AND NATO'S WAY OF REALLY GET

273
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
BEING BEHIND TURKEY, A CLOSE

274
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
ALLY SAYING WE SUPPORT YOU.

275
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WAS

276
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
QUICK TO POINT OUT THAT THE

277
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
PATRIOT MISSILES ARE JUST

278
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
THAT, DEFENSIVE WEAPONS THAT

279
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
WILL BE PUT DOWN ALONG THE

280
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
SYRIAN BORDER TO PROTECT

281
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
SYRIA, PROTECT TURKEY FROM

282
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
ATTACKS BY SYRIAN JETS OR

283
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
SCUD MISSILES THAT WOULD FLY

284
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
IN BUT THAT IS NOT EXACTLY

285
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
THE WHOLE STORY.

286
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
THE PATRIOTS COULD BE EASILY

287
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
PROGRAMMED AND PUT IN A

288
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
NO-FLY ZONE OVER NORTHERN

289
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
SYRIA.

290
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
SO FAR TURKEY IS DENYING

291
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
THAT AS IS NATO SAYING THIS

292
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
IS PURELY DEFENSIVE MOVE BY

293
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
TURKEY BUT IF THERE WERE TO

294
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
BE A NO-FLY ZONE IN THE

295
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
COMING MONTHS IT WOULD BE A

296
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
GAME-CHANGER BECAUSE THE

297
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
REBELS CONTROL MUCH OF

298
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
NORTHERN SYRIA.

299
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
THE PRESIDENT ASSAD IS USING

300
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
HIS AIR FORCE AND THE FIRST

301
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
REAL STEP TO PROVIDE SIS --

302
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
ASSISTANCE TO REBELS TO

303
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
OVERCOME PRESIDENT ASSAD'S

304
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
REGIME WOULD BE A NO-FLY

305
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
ZONE.

306
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
WE HAVE TO READ BEHIND THE

307
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
HEADLINES TO SEE WHAT ELSE

308
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
THE PATRIOT MISSILES COULD

309
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
MEAN FOR THE LARGER

310
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
CONFLICT.

311
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
ALISYN: THAT IS GOOD

312
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
CONTEXT.

313
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
WHAT IS RUSSIA SAYING NOW

314
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
ABOUT THE ASSAD REGIME?

315
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
>> Reporter: YESTERDAY THEY

316
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
CAME OUT AND SAID, ALL RIGHT,

317
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
WE THINK THERE IS A

318
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
POSSIBILITY PRESIDENT ASSAD

319
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
WOULD FALL.
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS

320
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
SPEAKING TO TRUTH AS THIS

321
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT DID MAY NOT

322
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
EXACTLY JIVE WITH THE PARTY

323
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
LINE.
INSIDE BASEBALL HERE AS

324
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
RUSSIA CAME OUT TODAY AND

325
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
FORCEFULLY GOTTEN BEHIND

326
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
PRESIDENT ASSAD SAID, NO, NO,

327
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
OUR DIPLOMAT WAS MISQUOTED.

328
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
HE WAS SAYING WHAT THE

329
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
OPPOSITION WAS SAYING.

330
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
A LITTLE FANCIFUL.

331
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
THERE WAS HOPE AS THE

332
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS

333
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
INCREASES INSIDE SYRIA THERE

334
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
ARE MANY MORE HUNDREDS IF

335
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
NOT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

336
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
DYING INSIDE SYRIA THAT

337
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
RUSSIA MAY BE LOOSENING TIES

338
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
TO PRESIDENT ASSAD.

339
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
SADLY FOR THE UNITED STATES

340
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
AND ALLIES WE FOUND OUT THAT

341
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
RUSSIA IS CONTINUING TO HOLD

342
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
FAST WITH PRESIDENT ASSAD

343
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
THEIR LONG TIME ALLY AND

344
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
HAPPY TO SEE HIM KILL AS

345
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
MANY OF HIS OWN CITIZENS AS

346
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
HE WOULD LIKE.

347
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
ALISYN: THANKS LELAND.

348
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
BILL: YOU THINK ABOUT THE

349
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
LAST TWO YEARS OF HEADLINES

350
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
AND THINK ABOUT THIS REGION

351
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
HOW MUCH IT DOMINATED THE

352
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
COVERAGE WE'VE HAD AND HERE

353
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
AND ALL OVER THE WORLD

354
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
FRANKLY.
HERE IS SYRIA IN THE MIDDLE

355
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
OF ALL THIS MESS HERE BUT

356
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
HEADLINES OUT OF TURKEY,

357
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
LIBYA, AND INTO IRAN WAY TO

358
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
THE EAST BUT SPECIFICALLY

359
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
WITH REGARD TO THESE PATRIOT

360
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
BATTERIES, PATRIOT MISS SIS

361
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
ILLS -- MISSILES, ADVANCE TO

362
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
HERE IS THE BORDER THAT

363
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
SEPARATES TURKEY AND SYRIA.

364
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
ABOUT 500 MILES FROM WEST TO

365
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
EAST.
YOU HEARD LELAND TALK ABOUT

366
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
THE PATRIOT TREAT MISSILE

367
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
BATTERSRIES.
THERE IS 500 MILE BORDER.

368
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF

369
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
SIGNIFICANT BORDER CROSSINGS

370
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
HERE AND OVER HERE.

371
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
DAMASCUS THE CAPITAL CITY IS

372
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
DOWN IN THIS AREA.

373
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT

374
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
THE TWO BATTERIES THE U.S.

375
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
WILL SEND, 400 TROOPS WILL

376
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
GO ALONG WITH THAT, YOU'RE

377
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
TALKING ABOUT AN AREA MAYBE

378
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000

566
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT.

567
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
WOULD YOU GIVE THEM THE

568
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT?

569
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
PERHAPS IT'S NOT DONE JUST

570
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
YET?

571
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
PERHAPS IT IS NOT FINISHED?

572
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
DOES IT TAKE 3 1/2 MONTHS?

573
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
>> THIS IS WHAT IS JUST SO

574
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
FRUSTRATING.

575
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
NOT THAT IS JUST TOOK SO

576
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
FEW WEEKS AGO, ABOUT A MONTH

580
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
AFTER, A MONTH AFTER,

581
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
REPORTERS WERE ON THE SITE

582
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
FINDING TWO OF THE 9/11

583
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
MEMOS SENT BY OUR AMBASSADOR

584
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000

585
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
THAT VERY DAY THERE HAD BEEN

589
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
A POLICE OFFICER, BENGHAZI

590
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
POLICE OFFICER, SUSPICIOUSLY

591
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
THEY WERE ASKING FOR ASSETS

593
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
TO HELP DEFEND THAT EMBASSY.

594
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
SO YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT

595
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
THAT THE FBI HAD NOT SECURED

596
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
THAT SITE.

597
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
HERE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR

598
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000

PERTINENT QUESTIONS BECAUSE

619
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
THE NECESSITY OF HAVING THE

620
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
CONTINGENCY PLAN, WHEN YOUR

621
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000

622
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
CONTINGENCY PLAN AND YOUR

623
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
OWN AMBASSADOR HAS EXPRESSED

624
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
HIS CONCERNS THAT HIS

625
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000

626
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
PRESENCE AND THEN YOU, AND

629
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
THEN YOU DISTANCE YOURSELF

630
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
FROM THE ARGUMENT THAT IT'S

631
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
A AL QAEDA ATTACK ON 9/11,

632
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000

JOHN HAMMAR WAS ARRESTED.

954
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
THE FIRST CALL WAS A DEMAND

955
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
FOR $1800 TO BE SENT VIA

956
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000

959
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
OLIVIA HAMMAR SAID THE CALL

960
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
MADE HER PHYSICALLY ILL.

961
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
>> WE HAVE YOUR SON AND

HE WAS LIKE, THEY CAN'T HELP

968
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
YOU.
>> Reporter: IT WAS ONLY

969
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
AFTER THOSE NUMEROUS THREATS

970
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
THAT JOHN HAMMAR WAS MOVED

971
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000

976
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
WHO ELSE IS GIVING HIM

977
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
SUPPORT?
>> Reporter: THROUGHOUT THIS

978
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
FOUR MONTHS THE FAMILY HAS

979
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
BEEN INITIALLY LOW-KEY BUT

980
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
THAT DIDN'T GET THEM

981
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
ANYWHERE.
NOW THEY'RE BECOMING VERY

982
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
PUBLIC.

983
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
A LOT OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY

984
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
AND ONLINE PETITIONS AS WELL

985
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
AS ELECTED OFFICIALS.

986
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
THE FAMILY'S CONGRESSWOMAN

987
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
HAS IMPLIED THAT THE STATE

988
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
DEPARTMENT IS NOT DOING

989
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
ENOUGH TO FREE JOHN HAMMAR.

990
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
>> I AM VERY FRUSTRATED THAT

991
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
WITH THE RESPONSE OF THE

992
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
STATE DEPARTMENT.

993
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
IT IS VERY

994
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]
IC, IT IS VERY COLD.

995
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT

996
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
IT'S THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S

997
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
FAULT.

998
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
OF COURSE THE MEXICAN

999
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
GOVERNMENT IS AT FAULT.

1000
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES ARE

1001
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
THE RESPONSIBLE ONES.

1002
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000

GOOD MORNING, EDDIE.

1017
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
>> GOOD MORNING, AISYN.

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
GOOD TO TALK TO YOU.

1019
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
ALISYN: LET ME MAKE SURE WE

1020
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
HAVE THE STORY CORRECT.

1021
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
JOHN HAS BEEN HELD SINCE

1022
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
AUGUST.
HE WAS TRAVELING THROUGH

1023
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
MEXICO ON A ROAD TRIP WITH A

1024
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
BUDDY.
THEY WERE GOING TO

1025
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
COSTA RICA TO GO SURFING.

1026
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
WHY DID JOHN HAVE THIS

1027
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
ANTIQUE GUN WITH HIM?

1028
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
>> I'LL TELL YOU THE WAY I

1029
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
UNDERSTAND THEY WERE GOING

1030
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
TO GO HUNTING IN COSTA RICA

1031
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
AND NICARAGUA.

1032
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
THEY HAD A SINGLE SHOTGUN IN

1033
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
WINNEBAGO KIND OF A CAMPER.

1034
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH

1035
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
MEXICO TO GET THERE.

1036
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
THAT IS WHERE THEY WERE

1037
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
GOING TO USE IT, WHICH IS

1038
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
SPORTING GUN USED IN THE

1039
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

1040
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
ALISYN: HE DID ALL THE RIGHT

1041
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
THINGS.
HE DECLARED THE GUN.

1042
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
HE FILLED OUT ALL THE

1043
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
PAPERWORK.
HE ALERTED OFFICIALS THAT HE

1044
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
HAD THE GUN AND YET THEY

1045
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
STILL ARRESTED HIM.

1046
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
NOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE

1047
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
PRISON WHERE HE IS BEING

1048
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
HELD IS NOTORIOUS FOR

1049
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
HOUSING VERY DANGEROUS

1050
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
CRIMINALS, MEMBERS OF THE LO

1051
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
IS THE ZETAS DRUG CARTEL.

1052
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
WE HAVE BEEN REPORTS HE IS

1053
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
CHAINED TO HIS BED IN THE

1054
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
CELL, THE PRISON OFFICIALS

1055
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
FEARED HE MIGHT TRY TO

1056
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
ESCAPE.
THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS

1057
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
ASKED ABOUT ALL OF THIS

1058
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
YESTERDAY.

1059
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
LET ME PLAY FOR YOU THEIR

1060
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
RESPONSE.

1061
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
>> THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT

1062
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IS

1063
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
NOT STEPPING IN TO HELP US

1064
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
WHILE THEY TAKE OUR MONEY

1065
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
AND TAKE ALL THE HELP WE

1066
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
GIVE THEM.
IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT OUR

1067
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
OWN U.S. GOVERNMENT IS NOT

1068
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
DOING ALL THAT WE CAN TO

1069
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
BRING HAMMAR HOME FOR

1070
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
CHRISTMAS.

1071
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
THE FAMILY DESERVES THIS.

1072
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
HE HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG.

1073
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
ALISYN: THAT WAS ACTUALLY

1074
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, LEADING

1075
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
THE CHARGE TO GET HIM OUT.

1076
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
WHAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT

1077
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
TOLD US WE FIXED THOSE

1078
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
PROBLEMS.
HE IS OUT OF THE GENERAL

1079
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
POPULATION.

1080
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
HE IS NO LONGER IN DANGER

1081
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
AND HE IS NOT BEING CHAINED

1082
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
TO HIS BED.

1083
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
IS THAT ACCURATE?

1084
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
>> LET ME TAKE THIS ONE BY

1085
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
ONE BECAUSE THE, YOUR

1086
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
PREAMBLE IS CORRECT UP TO A

1087
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
POINT.

1088
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY

1089
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
WRONG THAT TOOK

1090
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
FIRST PLACE.

1091
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
WHEN HE WENT TO MEXICO HE

1092
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
STOPPED IN THE U.S. BORDER

1093
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
SITE AND ASKED A CUSTOMS AND

1094
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
BORED PROTECTION AGENT

1095
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
WHETHER IT WAS LEGAL TO TAKE

1096
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
THE GUN TO MEXICO, THE

1097
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
SHOTGUN.

1098
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
HE RESPONDED, YES.

1099
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FILL

1100
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
THIS PAPERWORK AND THEN,

1101
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY.

1102
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
HE FILLED PAPERWORK BUT THAT

1103
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
PAPERWORK WAS REALLY TO COME

1104
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
BACK INTO THE UNITED STATES.

1105
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
THE UNITED STATES CUSTOMS

1106
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
PERSONNEL HAD NO BUSINESS

1107
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
TELLING HIM BECAUSE THEY

1108
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
DON'T KNOW WHAT MEXICAN LAW

1109
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
STATES.

1110
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
MECHANIC CAN LAW STATES THAT

1111
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
CERTAIN KIND OF WEAPONS,

1112
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT,

1113
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
ARE USED OR DEEMED TO BE FOR

1114
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE ARMED

1115
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
FORCES.
THAT IS THE ISSUE HERE.

1116
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
ALISYN: IN OTHER WORDS HE

1117
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
GOT MISINFORMATION.

1118
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT

1119
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
WHAT THE RULES WERE.

1120
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
SO THIS SEEMS LIKE A

1121
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
TECHNICALITY.

1122
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES THAT

1123
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
ARE ALLIES COULD BE QUICKLY

1124
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
RESOLVED.

1125
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
WHY IS HE STILL IN PRISON

1126
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
FROM AUGUST?

1127
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
>> OKAY.

1128
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
FIRST OF ALL, IT HAS TO BE

1129
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
RESOLVED UNDER THE LAW.
I MEAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING

1130
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
WITH A PHONE CALL.

1131
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
THINGS CAN HAPPEN BUT WE,

1132
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
JUST LIKE WE HAVE IN THE
UNITED STATES A COURT

1133
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
SYSTEM.

1134
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
BUT LET ME PUT A LITTLE MORE

1135
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
DEPTH INTO THIS.

1136
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
YOU'RE CORRECT.

1137
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I FILED THREE FEDERAL

1138
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
INJUNCTIONS.

1139
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
ONE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN

1140
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
TO ME ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AGO.

1141
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
THE PROSECUTOR DIDN'T EVEN

1142
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
RESPOND TO IT BECAUSE WE

1143
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
ALLEGE AND WE PROVED

1144
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
VIOLATIONS OF JOHN'S MEXICAN

1145
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.

1146
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'M STILL WAITING RIGHT NOW

1147
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
FOR THE JUDGE TO ISSUE HIS

1148
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
JUDGMENT BECAUSE HE COULD BE

1149
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
FREE WITHIN 24 HOURS ONCE HE

1150
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
FIND THOSE VIOLATIONS.

1151
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I ALREADY TALKED TO THE

1152
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
JUDGE MORE THAN TWO TIMES.

1153
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
NOW WE'RE GOING, IF WE NEED

1154
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
WE'LL TAKE IT UPSTAIRS.

1155
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
WE'LL TAKE IT TO THE MEXICAN

1156
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
SUPREME COURT.

1157
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
ALISYN: OKAY.
>> RIGHT NOW THIS IS AN

1158
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
ISSUE.

1159
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
IT IS A TECHNICALITY BUT IT

1160
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
GETS BETTER HERE.

1161
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
YOU SEE THE CALIBER OF THE

1162
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
GUN WHICH IS .410, WHAT IS

1163
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
SEEMED KNOWN FOR EXCLUSIVE

1164
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
USE FOR THE ARMY.

1165
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
THE BULLETS ARE NONEXCLUSIVE

1166
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
USE FOR THE ARMY.

1167
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
ONLY THE SHOTGUN.

1168
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
ONLY THING MAKING IT OKAY

1169
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
LIKE ADMINISTRATIVE FINE IT

1170
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
IS .18 MILLIMETERS.

1171
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
THAT IS THE SIZE OF YOUR

1172
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
FINGER, ALISYN.

1173
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
THAT IS WHAT IS RIDICULOUS.

1174
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
ALISYN: EDDIE, A LOT OF

1175
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
STUFF HERE TAKEN ON FACE

1176
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
VALUE DOES SOUND RIDICULOUS.

1177
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I UNDERSTAND YOU SAY IT HAS

1178
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
TO GO THROUGH A COURT

1179
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
PROCESS.
OKAY.

1180
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
IS HE GETTING A TRIAL?

1181
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
IS HE SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL?

1182
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
>> OKAY, HE IS BUT I'LL TELL

1183
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
YOU, RIGHT NOW I'M PUTTING

1184
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
THE MEXICAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM,

1185
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
BECAUSE OF TWO JUDGES REALLY

1186
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
AND A PROSECUTOR WHO DIDN'T

1187
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
USE HIS PROSECUTORIAL

1188
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
DISCRETION, THAT HE COULD

1189
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
HAVE USED IT.

1190
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
THE FIRST PROSECUTOR MADE A

1191
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
BIG MISTAKE IN MEASURING THE

1192
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
SHOTGUN.

1193
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
THE PROSECUTOR'S OWN EXPERT

1194
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
HAD ANOTHER MEASUREMENT.

1195
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
SO I HAVE MY EXPERT BECAUSE

1196
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
WE BELIEVE ANYWAY THAT

1197
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
MEASUREMENT IS INCORRECT

1198
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
THAT WAS TAKEN.

1199
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
THAT'S WHAT IS MAKING THE

1200
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIBERTY

1201
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
AND PRISON RIGHT NOW.

1202
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
BUT WE BELIEVE AND WE'RE

1203
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
VERY, VERY CERTAIN THAT JOHN

1204
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
IS GOING TO COME HOME, I CAN

1205
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
TELL YOU THAT.

1206
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
ALISYN: I AM COMFORTED BY

1207
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
YOUR OPTIMISM AS WE ALSO

1208
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
KNOW JOHN SUFFERS FROM PTSD.

1209
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
HE SERVED MULTIPLE TOURS OF

1210
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
DUTY IN AFGHANISTAN AND

1211
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
IRAQ.
IN FACT HE WAS IN A

1212
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
GUNBATTLE IN FALLUJAH IN

1213
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
2004.
HOW HE IS DOING TODAY?

1214
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
>> LET ME TELL YOU BECAUSE I

1215
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
HAVE SPOKEN TO HIM LATELY,

1216
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
HIS FAMILY HAS.

1217
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
WE DECIDED TO DO, HAVE SOME

1218
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
STRATEGY I'M NOT AT LIBERTY

1219
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
TO DISCUSS BECAUSE I'M GOING

1220
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
TO THE COURT HEARINGS.

1221
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
JOHN, LET ME TELL YOU THIS

1222
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
FOR THE PUBLIC.

1223
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
IT IS GREAT WE'RE ALL

1224
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
PUSHING FOR HIM AND WE NEED

1225
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
YOUR HELP IN THAT.

1226
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
LET ME TELL YOU, JOHN IS A

1227
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
TOUGH COOKIE.

1228
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
SEMPER FI, MARINES, PREPARE

1229
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
THEM REALLY GOOD.

1230
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
YOU STATED SOMETHING ELSE

1231
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
WHICH IS VERY TRUE, HE WAS

1232
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
MOVED OVER, WHEN I GOT INTO

1233
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
THE CASE BECAUSE OTHER

1234
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
LAWYERS HAD BEEN THERE AND

1235
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
THERE WAS SOME LEGAL

1236
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
MANEUVERING IF YOU WILL THAT

1237
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
TOOK PLACE.

1238
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
AFTER THIS I SPOKE TO THE

1239
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
JUDGE PERSONALLY BECAUSE I

1240
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
WANTED TO CROSS-EXAMINE THE

1241
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
MEXICAN CUSTOMS AGENT THAT

1242
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
SHOULD HAVE RELEASED HIM

1243
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
ANYWAY.
THERE WERE TWO COURT

1244
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
HEARINGS SET, ONE FOR

1245
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
NOVEMBER 17th, ONE FOR

1246
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
NOVEMBER 23rd.

1247
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
SO THE JUDGE CONTINUED

1248
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
HEARINGS UNTIL JANUARY 17th,

1249
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I SAY, NOVEMBER 30th WE'RE

1250
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
READY TO GO TO TRIAL.

1251
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I'M IN NEW YORK WITH MY KIDS

1252
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
IN THANKSGIVING I GET A

1253
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
PHONE CALL, JOHN WAS TAKEN

1254
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
TO COURT ON NOVEMBER 23rd,

1255
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
WITHOUT HIS LAWYER PRESENT,

1256
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
THAT'S ME AND MOST IMPORTANT

1257
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
THEY TALKED TO HIM.

1258
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
AND I WAS ADAMANT AND

1259
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
FURIOUS BECAUSE THEY REALLY

1260
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
WANTED TO PUSH HIM TO KIND

1261
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
OF PLEAD GUILTY.

1262
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
OF COURSE HE DIDN'T.

1263
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
YEAH, LET ME TELL YOU.

1264
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
AFTER HIS FIRST LAWYERS

1265
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
WANTED HIM SAID YOU WOULD BE

1266
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
OUT IN THREE YEARS.

1267
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I WILL NOT ALLOW HIM TO

1268
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
PLEAD TO A FELONY.

1269
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
NO WAY.

1270
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
ALISYN: OF COURSE YOU ARE.
YOU ARE CONVINCED OF HIS

1271
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
INNOCENCE AS HE IS.

1272
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
AND HIS FAMILY.

1273
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
>> I AM AS THE FAMILY.

1274
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
WE'LL BRING HIM OUT.

1275
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
ALISYN: WE LIKE YOUR

1276
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
OPTIMISM.

1277
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
EDDIE, THANKS VERY MUCH FOR

1278
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
THE UPDATE ON EXACTLY WHAT

1279
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
IS GOING ON DOWN THERE.

1280
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
>> MY PLEASURE, ALISYN.

1281
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

1282
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
EVERYBODY KEEP WRITING

1283
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW.

1288
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
-- WITH THE JUDICIARY.

1289
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
ALISYN: I'M SURE OUR VIEWERS

1290
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
WILL COMPLY WITH YOUR

1291
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
REQUESTS.
THIS IS TOPIC THAT IS NEAR

1292
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
AND DEAR TO THEIR HEARTS

1293
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000

1296
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
ALISYN: VERY DANGEROUS.

1297
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
NOTORIOUS.
BILL: MEMBERS OF THE ZETAS

1298
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
AND OTHER DRUG CARTELS ARE

1299
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
HELD THERE.

1322
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000

NOW HOW A GIANT BOULDER

1326
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
ENDED UP INSIDE ONE FAMILY'S

re
so awesomely delicious

1329
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
my husband and I
can't stop eating 'em!

1330
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
What's...that...
on your head?

1331
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Can curlers!

1332
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Tomato basil.
Potato with bacon.

1333
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
We've got
a lotta empty cans.

1334
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
[ Male Announcer ] Hear from
our chefs on Facebook
this Friday!

1335
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Social Security are just numbers
thinkin a budget.d... cans.

1336
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Well, we worked hard for those
benefits.

1337
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
We earned them.

1338
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And if Washington tries to cram
decisions about the future...

1339
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
of these programs into a last
minute budget deal...

1340
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
we'll all pay the price.

1341
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
AARP is fighting to protect
seniors with responsible...

1342
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
solutions that strengthen
Medicare and...

1343
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Social Security for generations
to come.

1344
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
We can do better than a last
minute deal...

1345
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
that would hurt all of us.

1346
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
...so as you can see, GEICO's
customer satisfaction is at 97%.

1347
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Mmmm tasty.

1348
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And cut! Very good.

1349
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

1350
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

1351
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

1352
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It's not real.

1353
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

1354
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

1355
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

1356
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

1357
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And also to build my career.

1358
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
So I'm not about to always let
my frequent bladder urges,

1359
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
or the worry my pipes
might leak get in the way

1360
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
of my busy lifestyle.

1361
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
That's why I take care,
with VESIcare.

1362
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Once-daily VESIcare can help
control your bladder muscle

1363
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
and is proven to treat
overactive bladder

1364
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
with sympts of

1365
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
frequent urges and leaks
day and night.

1366
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
If you have certain stomach or
glaucoma problems,

1367
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
or trouble emptying
your bladder,

1368
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
do not take VESIcare.

1369
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
VESIcare may cause allergic
reactions that may be serious.

1370
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
If you experience swelling of
the face, lips,

1371
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
throat or tongue,

1372
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
stop taking VESIcare
and get emergency help.

1373
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Tell your doctor right away if
you have severe abdominal pain,

1374
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
or become constipated for three
or more days.

1375
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
VESIcare may
cause blurred vision,

1376
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
so use caution while driving
or doing unsafe tasks.

1377
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Common side effects
are dry mouth, constipation,

1378
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
and indigestion.

1379
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I've worked hard
to get to where I am...

1380
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and I've got better
aces to go

1381
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
than always
going to the bathroom.

1382
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So take charge of your symptoms
by talking to your doctor

1383

WE CAN'T COVER YOU ANYMORE

1423
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000

WE'RE NOT GOING TO RUN OUR

1429
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
OWN EXCHANGE IN OUR STATE.

1430
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR

00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
EVERYDAY AMERICANS LIVING IN

1432
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
THAT STATE?
>> BY THE WAY, BILL, I THINK

1433
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
THE REASON THEY'RE SAYING IT

1434
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
ONE MIGHT ARGUE THERE'S

1435
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
POLITICS BUT ALSO ISSUES OF

1436
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
FISCAL RESTRAINT.

1437
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
THOSE 19 STATES MAY BE

1438
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
SAYING HEY, WE CAN'T AFFORD

1439
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
TO DO THIS.

1440
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
WE PLAY NOT BE ABLE TO

1441
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
AFFORD TO SET UP THESE

1442
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
EXCHANGES.

1443
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY,

1444
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
BY CURRENT ESTIMATES WILL

1445
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
HAVE TO SPEND ALMOST A

1446
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
BILLION DOLLARS IN THOSE

1447
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
STATES SETTING UP EXCHANGES.

1448
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
NOW FOR PEOPLE OUT THERE

1449
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
WHAT THIS WILL MEAN, IF YOU

1450
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE 19

1451
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
STATES, COME NEXT OCTOBER,

1452
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

1453
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
PROBABLY DEAL WITH AN

1454
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
EXCHANGE THAT THE FEDS SET

1455
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
UP FOR THE STATES AND THE

1456
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
PROBLEM WITH THAT, IN MY

1457
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
OPINION, IS THAT IT ADDS

1458
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
ANOTHER LEFT OF BUREAUCRACY,

1459
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
BECAUSE, BILL, SINCE WE

1460
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
DON'T HAVE PORTABILITY OF

1461
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
INSURANCE, SINCE INSURANCE

1462
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
COMPANIES ARE STATE BY STATE,

1463
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
IT'S YOUR STATE GOVERNMENT

1464
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
THAT IS USED TO DEALING WITH

1465
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
YOUR LOCAL INSURANCE

1466
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
COMPANIES, NOT THE FEDERAL

1467
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
GOVERNMENT.

1468
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
SO IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

1469
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
IS RUNNING THE EXCHANGE THEY

1470
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
MAY NOT BE USED TO DEALING

1471
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
WITH YOUR LOCAL BLUE

1472
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
CROSS-BLUE SHIELD.

1473
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
BILL: THAT'S A GREAT POINT.

1474
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
THERE ARE 17 STATES AND

1475
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
WASHINGTON, D.C. SAY THEY

1476
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
WILL SET UP AN EXCHANGE WITH

1477
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

1478
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

1489
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
NOT GIVEN OUT THE PLANS HOW

1490
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000

THEY CAN'T GO ACROSS STATE

1511

1843
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
CHARACTERIZED THAT AS A DATE ON

1844
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
THE CALENDAR RATHER THAN A DATE

1845
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
CERTAIN.
ALISYN: SO MANY QUESTIONS

1846
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
REMAIN, CATHERINE HERRIDGE,

1847
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000

UNVARNISHED RECORD.

1849
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
BILL: WE HAVE NEW REACTION TO

1850
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
THE U.N. AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE

1851
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
BOWING OUT OF THIS.

1852
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
THE FALLOUT FROM BENGHAZI

1853
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
WEIGHED HEAVILY ON HER

1854
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
DECISION.

TIRELESS TO ADVANCE OUR NATION'S

1860
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
VALUES.

1861
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I AM CONFIDENT SHE WILL CONTINUE

1862
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
TO REPRESENT THE UNITED STATES

1863
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
WITH STRENGTH AND KILL.

SEPTEMBER 16 THIS WHEN

1872
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
INFORMATION THAT WAS KNOWN SET.

1873
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
ALMOST TWO MONTHS LATER

1874
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
AMBASSADOR RICE'S NAME IS

1875
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000

1876
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
REPLACE OUTGOING HILLARY

1877
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
CLINTON, AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY

1878
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
NEAR LIE 100 REPUBLICAN HOUSE

1879
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
MEMBERS WRITE TO PRESIDENT OBAMA

01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
DISCOURAGING HIM FROM NOMINATING

1881
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
HER.
AT THE END OF NOVEMBER

1882
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
AMBASSADOR RICE MET WITH

1883
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS TO DISCUSS

1884
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
BENGHAZI AND AFTERWARDS G G.O.P.

1885
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
SENATORS SAY THEY ARE MORE

1886
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
CONCERNED ABOUT HER RESPONSE TOW

1887
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
THE ATTACK.

1888
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
YESTERDAY, DECEMBER 13th

1889
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
AMBASSADOR RICE WITHDRAWS HER

1890
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
NAME FROM CONSIDERATION TO BE

1891
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
THE NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE.

1892
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
>> ADD THIS TO THE MIX NOW,

1893
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
QUESTIONS BEING RAISED AFTER NBC

1894
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
NEWS CORRESPONDENT ANDREA

1895
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
MITCHELL TALKED ABOUT THE

1896
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
WITHDRAWAL OF SUSAN RICE AND THE

1897
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
PERCEPTION OF THE REPUBLICAN

1898
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
PARTY.

1899
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID.

1900
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
ROLL IT.

1901
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
>> I THINK THAT THIS HAD BECOME

1902
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
SORT OF AN IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGE

1903
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
FOR HER TO BE CONFIRMED.

1904
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
SHE REALIZED THAT, THE WHITE

1905
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
HOUSE REALIZED IT AS WELL.

1906
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I THINK THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE

1907
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
ON GOOD POLITICAL FALLEN GROUND

1908
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
AS YOU POINTED OUT.

1909
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
THIS IS NOT GOING TO HELP

1910
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
REPUBLICANS AT ALL THE FACT THAT

1911
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
A WOMAN, AND A WOMAN OF COLOR

1912
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
HAS BEEN FORCED OUT OF THE

1913
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
CONFIRMATION PROCESS EVEN BEFORE

1914
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
SHE WAS NOMINATED.

1915
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
BILL: A WOMAN AND A WOMAN OF

1916
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
COLOR.
I HAVE CHRIS WALLACE WITH ME.

1917
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
HOW ARE YOU DOING.

1918
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
>> GOOD MORNING, BILL.

1919
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
BILL: I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT

1920
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
SQUARES WITH RICE R*

1921
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,000
CONDOLEEZZAA RICE OR COLIN

1922
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
POWELL.
>> AS I HEARD THIS I'M TRYING TO

1923
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
HELP THE LAST TIME THERE WAS A

1924
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
WHITE MAN AS SECRETARY OF THE

1925
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
STATE, BECAUSE MADELEINE

1926
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
ALBRIGHT BACK TO THE CLINTON

1927
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
YEARS, I THINK IT WAS WARREN

1928
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
CHRISTOPHER IN THE FIRST TERM OF

1929
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
BILL CLINTON BACK IN 96 OVE 96

1930
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
OR SOMETHING -RPBGTS SO , SO I

1931
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
DON'T KNOW.

1932
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
BILL: WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT SUSAN

1933
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
COLLINS SHE WAS THE MODERATE

1934
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
FEMALE SENATOR THAT SUSAN RICE

1935
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
WENT TO CAPITOL HILL TO MEET

1936
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
WITH.
IF THEY GOT SUSAN COLLINS

1937
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
SUPPORT SHE'D BE OKAY AND SUSAN

1938
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
COLLINS CAME OUT AND BLASTED

1939
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
SUSAN RICE.

1940
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
>> SUSAN COLLINS IS INTERTING

1941
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
BECAUSE SUSAN RICE HAD A

1942
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
CONNECTION TO MAIN.

1943
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE IS

1944
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
NOMINATED FOR A POSITION THERE

1945
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
IS A SENATOR FROM THEIR HOME

1946
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
STATE WHO INTRODUCES THEM TO THE

1947
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
COMMITTEE, AND IT WAS SUSAN

1948
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
COLLINS WHO INTRODUCED SUSAN

1949
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
RICE TO THE COMMITTEE BACK IN

1950
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
2009, AND YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT.

1951
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE LIKE

1952
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
LINDSEY GRAHAM AND JOHN MCCAIN

1953
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
WHO WERE AGAINST SUSAN RICE AND

1954
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I'M NOT SURE ANYTHING WAS GOING

1955
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
TO SATISFY THEM.

1956
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
WHEN SHE WENT TO SEE A QUITE

1957
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
MODERATE REPUBLICAN LIKE SUSAN

1958
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
COLLINS AND SHE CAME OUT AND

1959
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
SAID SHE HAD MORE QUESTIONS THAN

1960
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
BEFORE THE MEETING.

1961
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I'VE NEVER SEEN WHEN THERE'S

1962
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
BEEN A NOMINATION -- EVEN BEFORE

1963
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
THERE IS A NOMINATION SOMEBODY

1964
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
IS GOING UP AND DOING THAT

1965
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
NOMINATION CHARM TOUR TO TRY TO

1966
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
GREASE THE SKIDS ON THIS KIND OF

1967
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
A THING TO MAKE IT EASIER TO GET

1968
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
THE NOMINATION.

1969
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
THIS SHE DID BEFORE SHE WAS EVEN

1970
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
NAMED AND IT BACKFIRED

1971
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
TERRIBLY.

1972
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
SHE DID BADLY IN EVERY SESSION

1973
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
THAT SHE HAD WITH REPUBLICANS

1974
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
AND DEMOCRATS.

1975
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
BILL: LET'S MOVE ON NOW TO THE

1976
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
FISCAL CLIFF.

1977
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
JOHN BOEHNER MAY GO HOME TO OHIO

1978
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
THIS WEEKEND.

1979
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
DOES THAT TELL US ANYTHING?

1980
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
>> NO, I MEAN FIRST OF ALL, I

1981
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
MEAN THERE ARE TELEPHONES, AND

1982
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
THERE IS INTERNET.

1983
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
AT THIS POINT A LOT OF THE STUFF

1984
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
IS BEING DONE BY STAFF AND THEY

1985
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
ARE NOT GOING TO THEIR HOMES,

1986
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
BOTH WHITE HOUSE STAFF AND JOHN

1987
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
BOEHNER'S STAFF.

1988
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
THE FACT THAT THEY HAD THE 50

1989
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
MINUTE NEATING AND IT WAS

1990
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
DESCRIBED AS FRANK WHICH IN

1991
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
DIPLOMATIC LANGUAGE BASICALLY

1992
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
MEANS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT OUR

1993
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
DISAGREEMENT, NO, WE ARE

1994
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
NOWHERE.

1995
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
THERE SEEMS TO BE NO PROGRESS

1996
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
BEING MADE AND WE ARE ONE WEEK

1997
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
CLOSER TO THE CLIFF AS OF SUNDAY

1998
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
IT WILL BE, WHAT, 16 DAYS I

1999
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
THINK, SO WE'RE GETTING PRETTY

2000
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
CLOSE.
BILL: NOWHERE YOU'RE SAYING.

2001
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
YOU TALK TO THESE GUYS EVERY DAY

2002
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
DOWN THERE IN WASHINGTON.

2003
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
YOU'RE SAYING WE ARE NOWHERE

2004
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
CLOSE TO AN AGREEMENT?

2005
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
>> OH, NO.

2006
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I MEAN ABSOLUTELY NOT.

2007
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
JOHN BOEHNER IS CONTINUING TO

2008
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
HOLD THE POSITION THAT HE'S NOT

2009
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
GOING TO BULGE ON TAX RATES.

2010
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I THINK HE PROBABLY WOULD, BUT

2011
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO THAT NOT

2012
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
JUST A SORT OF POLITICAL COVER

2013
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
BUT ALSO TO GET IT PASSED BY THE

2014
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
HOUSE, REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE,

2015
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
IS HE NEEDS SERIOUS SPENDING

2016
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
CUTS AND EVEN ENTITLEMENT REFORM

2017
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
AND THERE SEEMS NO DISPOSITION

2018
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
ON THE PART OF THE PRESIDENT OR

2019
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
DEMOCRATS TO GO ALONG WITH

2020
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
THAT.

2021
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
YOU KNOW, YOU SEE PEOPLE LIKE

2022
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000

CHUCK NASH IS A FORMER RETIRED

2201
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:04,000
NAVY CAPTAIN AND A FOX NEWS

2202
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
ANALYST.
WE HAVE SENT 400 TROOPS TO THE

2203
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
BORDER WITH SYRIA.

2204
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
CAN THIS BE INTERPRETED AS U.S.

2205
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
TROOPS GETTING INVOLVED IN THE

2206
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
SYRIAN CONFLICT?
>> I THINK THIS IS MORE

2207
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
ACCURATELY DESCRIBED AS U.S.

2208
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
TROOPS HELPING OUT THE NATO

2209
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
ALLY, THIS IS PURELY A DEFENSIVE

2210
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
MOVE.
THESE TROOPS ARE NOT BEING PUT

2211
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
DIRECTLY IN HARM'S WAY, THEY ARE

2212
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
NOT CROSSING THE BORDER.

2213
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
THE PATRIOT MISSILE SYSTEM IS A

2214
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
DEFENSIVE WEAPONS SYSTEM AND

2215
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
IT'S BEING USED TO HELP THE

2216
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
TURKS UNDERSTAND THAT NATO IS

2217
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
WITH THEM ON THIS AND THE U.S.

2218
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
IS DOING SOMETHING AND TAKING

2219
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
PART WITH GERMANY AND THE

2220
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
NETHERLANDS.

2221
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
ALISYN: YOU SAY THIS IS A

2222
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
DEFENSIVE MISSION ONLY, BUT

2223
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
COULD THERE BE A SCENARIO IN

2224
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
WHICH THESE 400 TROOPS END UP

2225
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:53,000
HAVING TO ENFORCE A NO-FLY-ZONE

2226
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
OVER SYRIA?

2227
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
>> THAT IS A POTENTIAL, BECAUSE

2228
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
YOU DON'T NEED TO NECESSARILY DO

2229
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
THAT WITH AIRCRAFT.

2230
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
DEPENDING ON WHERE THE MISSILE

2231
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
BATTERIES ARE PUT IN PLACE, AND

2232
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
THE RANGE, THOSE MISSILES ARE

2233
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF NOT ONLY

2234
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
SHOOTING DOWN THEATER BALLISTIC

2235
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
MISSILES WHICH IS THE FIRST

2236
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
THING THAT EVERYONE WOULD THINK

2237
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,000
OF, THE SCUDS TO BE BLUNT,

2238
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
EVERYTHING IS THINKING ABOUT THE

2239
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
SCUDS RIGHT NOW BUT YOU COULD

2240
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
USE THAT SYSTEM TO TARGET MANNED

2241
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
AIRCRAFT AS WELL OR UAV'S.

2242
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
ALISYN: WE'VE HEARD FROM LEADERS

2243
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
INSURANCE NATIONALLY THIS WEEK

2244
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
WHO BELIEVE THAT THE BASHAR

2245
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
AL-ASSAD REGIME IS CLOSE TO

2246
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
COLLAPSING.

2247
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
AND IF YOU AGREE HOW CLOSE?

2248
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE IT.

2249
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
EVEN THE RUSSIANS ARE TALKING

2250
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
ABOUT EVACUATING THEIR PEOPLE.

2251
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
THEY HAVE A LOT OF ADVISERS IN

2252
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
THERE, THEY HAVE EMBASSY

2253
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
PERSONNEL IN THERE AS WELL,

2254
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
MILITARY ADVISERS, AND SO IF

2255
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT,

2256
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
THEN LOOK FOR ACTIVITY AROUND

2257
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
THE PORTS OF TARTUS AND

2258
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
LATAKIA.

2259
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH EQUIPMENT

2260
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
THEY WOULD RETROGRADE AND GET

2261
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
THE PEOPLE OUT THOSE TWO PORTS

2262
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
WOULD BE IMPORTANT AS WELL AS

2263
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
THE AIRPORTS AROUND DAMASCUS.

2264
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
ALISYN: MEANING WHAT IF YOU SAW

2265
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
MORE ACTIVE AROUND THE PORTS

2266
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
THAT WOULD MEAN BASHAR AL-ASSAD

2267
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
IS MAKING A RUN FOR IT?

2268
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
>> HE PROBABLY IS GOING TO WANT

2269
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
TO GET SOME STUFF OUT OF THERE.

2270
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
HE WOULD PROBABLY GET FLOWN OUT

2271
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DO IT WITH

2272
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
AS FEW OF PEOPLE THAT KNEW ABOUT

2273
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
IT AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE YOU WOULD

2274
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
HAVE A MASSIVE COLLAPSE IN THAT

2275
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
CASE.
NO MATTER HOW THIS TURNS OUT

2276
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
YOU'LL HAVE A LOT OF BAD PEOPLE

2277
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
WITH ACCESS TO A LOT OF REALLY

2278
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
BAD WEAPONS.

2279
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
AND YOU'VE GOT AL-QAIDA GROUPS

2280
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
IN THERE.

2281
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
EVERYBODY IN THE MAIN OPPOSITION

2282
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
IS CONNECTED WITH THE MUSLIM

2283
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
BROTHERHOOD, SO THERE REALLY

2284
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
AREN'T ANY GOOD SCENARIOS FOR

2285
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
THE END OF THIS THING.

2286
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
ALISYN: ON THAT CHILLING NOTE

2287
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
CAPTAIN CHUCK NASH THANK YOU SO

2288
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
MUCH FOR YOUR INPUT.

2289
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
BILL: A RUDE AWAKENING FOR SO

2290
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
MANY THIS MORNING.

2291
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
WHY THE LOCATION OF AN

2292
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
EARTHQUAKE ONLY HOURS AGO IS

2293
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
TELLING.

2294
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
ALISYN: AND DEVINE INTERVENTION

2295
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
OR JUST BAD LUCK?

2296
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
WHAT STOPS TWO THIEVES FROM

2297
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
ROBBING A CHURCH?

2298
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
BILL: GUILT.

2299

FIRST CHRISTMAS.

2301

THESE DEALS ALL SEEM GREAT
AT THE TIME...

2302
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
BUT LATER...

2303
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
[ shirt ]
MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY!

2304
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
NOT SO MUCH.
HO HO HO!

2305
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
THIS ISN'T
THAT KIND OF DEAL.

2306
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
[ Male Announcer ]
BREAK FROM THE HOLIDAY STRESS.

2307
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:21,000
SAVE ON GROUND SHIPPING
AT FEDEX OFFICE.

2308
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Looking back if it wasn't for
Shriners Hospital,.
[ Male Announcer ]
BREAK FROM THE HOLIDAY STRESS.

2309
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
things would just be really,
really different.

2310
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I lost my leg when I was a kid.

2311
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
There was a time when
I felt like I wasn't

2312
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
going to be able to
walk again...

2313
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
It was a pretty bad accident

2314
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
But Shriners showed me who
I could be again.

2315
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
They turned my whole
life around.

2316
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000

a million changed

01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
EARTHQUAKES IN SOUTHERN

2380
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
CALIFORNIA.

2381
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,000
>> I WANT TO SHOW THE FOLKS THE

2382
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
SAN ANDREAS FAULT, HOW IT

2383
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
RETURNS ALONG THE ENTIRE WEST

2384
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
COAST OF CALIFORNIA.

2385
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, SIR, IS

2386
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
THAT WHETHER OR NOT THE ONSHORE

2387
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
ACTIVITY IS RELATED TO THE

2388
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
OFFSHORE ACTIVITY.

2389
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
CAN YOU MAKE A CONNECTION OR

2390
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
NOT?

2391
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
>> WELL, WE'LL BE STUDYING THAT,

2392
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW.

2393
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
WHAT WE KNOW IS OBVIOUSLY THE

2394
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
PACIFIC OCEAN PLATE IS MOVING

2395
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
RELATIVE TO THE NORTH AMERICAN

2396
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
PLATE, THE SAN ANDREAS AND THE

2397
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
OTHER FAULTS ARE THE BOUNDRY.

2398
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
AWFUL THE DEMORE STATION ARE ON

2399
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
THE FAULT OR ON EITHER SIDE OF

2400
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
THE FAULT.
THE QUESTION FOR US IS THERE

2401
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
SOME PLATE DEFORMATION THAT IS

2402
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
TAKING PLACE IN THE OCEANIC ROCK

2403
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
TO THE WEST OF CALIFORNIA, COULD

2404
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
THAT POSE A THREAT OF

2405
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
EARTHQUAKES OR EVEN TSUNAMIS.

2406
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
TSUNAMIS.

2407
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
BILL: DOES THAT HELP US PREDICT

2408
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
THE NEXT BIG STPWHOPB.

2409
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
>> IT COULD HELP US PREDICT THE

2410
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
NEXT BIG ONE IF WE SEE UNUSUAL

2411
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
DEFORMATIONS OFFSHORE THAT ARE

2412
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
ASSOCIATED WITH EARTHQUAKES

2413
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
ONSHORE.
SO FAR I DON'T KNOW OF ANY

2414
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
UNUSUAL ONSHORE ACTIVITY.

2415
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
BILL: THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

2416
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000

2418
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
NO TSUNAMI ON THIS ONE, THE

2419
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
MAGNITUDE WAS NOT BIG ENOUGH TO

2420
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
CREATE ONE.

2421
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
THE DEPTH WAS INTERESTING TOO,

2422
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
ONLY ABOUT SIX MILES, WHICH IS

2423
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
SHALLOW.
THANK YOU, WE'LL CALL AGAIN ON

2424
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
YOU DOCTOR.

2425
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000

01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000

THIS IS IMPORTANT NOW, THE

THAT REPORTS OF A SHOOTING ARE

2507
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000

2508
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000

2526
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000

OF THESE EARLY REPORTS THAT THAT

2528
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000

2561
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
RESPONDING SAYS THE GOVERNMENT

2562
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
DOES TOO MUCH.

2563
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
THINK ABOUT THE DEADLINE TODAY

2564
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
FOR THESE HEALTH EXCHANGES.

2565
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
PUT THOSE TWO TOGETHER IF YOU

2566
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
CAN.
>> LOOK IT SEEMS OBVIOUS TO A

2567
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THE FEDERAL

2568
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
GOVERNMENT ESPECIALLY IS VERY

2569
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
BLOATED.

2570
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
YOU TALK IN THESE NUMBERS OF

2571
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
TRILLIONS ARE REALLY HARD TO PUT

2572
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
IN PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE IT'S MORE

2573
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
THAN ANY PERSON WILL EVER SEE IN

2574
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
THEIR LIFETIME USUALLY.

2575
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
SO I THINK THAT IS PART OF WHERE

2576
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
THIS IS COMING FROM.

2577
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE NUTS

2578
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
AND BOLTS OF CUTTING CERTAIN

2579
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
THINGS, PEOPLE SAY HEY I DON'T

2580
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
WANT THAT CUT, OR THAT CUT,

2581
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH

2582
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
THAT.
AS FAR AS THE HEALTHCARE

2583
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
EXCHANGES GO I DON'T THINK

2584
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
ANYBODY SHOULD UNDER ESTIMATE

2585
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
WHERE YOU LIKE THE BILL OR DON'T

2586
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
LIKE THE BILL HOW MUCH REALLY

2587
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
INTRICATE TOUGH WORK IS AHEAD

2588
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
FOR STATES AND THE FEDERAL

2589
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
GOVERNMENT THAT THEY ARE QUITE

2590
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
BEHIND ON AT THIS POINT IN ORDER

2591
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
TO ACCOMPLISH THAT.

2592
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
AND, FRANKLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT

2593
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
IS DOING A LOT OF STUFF, IN MY

2594
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
OPINION, OFTEN THAT IT SHOULD

2595
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
NOT BE INVOLVED IN, YOU END UP

2596
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
NOT BEING VERY GOOD AT A LOT OF

2597
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
THINGS.

2598
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
BILL: IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN

2599
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
THAT 49% NUMBER GIGS TO GO

2600
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
HIGHER.

2601
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
>> I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF

2602
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
SOME OF THESE THINGS GO VERY

2603
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
WRONG AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

2604
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
IS NOT ABLE TO PIN IT ON CERTAIN

2605
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
G.O.P. GOVERNORS AND PEOPLE LOOK

2606
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
AT THE THING AND SAY, HEY WHY

2607
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
DID YOU DECIDE TO DO THIS GIANT

2608
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
BILL IF YOU COULDN'T ACCOMPLISH

2609
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
IT.

2610
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
BILL: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

2611
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
THAT JUAN.

2612
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
>> I SAW IN THE PAPER, SOMEONE

2613
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
WAS QUOTED AS SAYING, A

2614
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
REPUBLICAN, THAT BASICALLY A LOT

2615
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
OF THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ARE

2616
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
CUTTING OFF THEIR NOSE TO SPITE

2617
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
THEIR FACE.

2618
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
PEOPLE THINK THE FEDERAL

2619
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
GOVERNMENT HAS TOO MUCH POWER.

2620
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
HERE YOU HAVE REPUBLICAN

2621
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
GOVERNORS REFUSING TO COOPERATE

2622
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
WITH THE HEALTHCARE PLAN BECAUSE

2623
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
IT'S PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN AND

2624
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
GIVING MORE POWER TO THE FEDERAL

2625
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH THESE

2626
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
EXCHANGES AND DETERMINE

2627
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
STANDARDS OF HEALTHCARE INSIDE

2628
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
THEIR STATES.
BILL: THEY ARE GOING TO SAVE

2629
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
MONEY BY WAY OF THIS.

2630
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
>> THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SAVE

2631
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
ANY MONEY.

2632
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
BILL: I THINK IT'S TRUE ABOUT

2633
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
POLICY WHENEVER IT HAPPENS FROM

2634
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THERE IS

2635
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:59,000
ALWAYS A YING TO THE YANK, I

2636
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
YANG.
IF YOU GO TOO FAR VOTERS ARE

2637
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
GOING TO PULL YOU BACK.

2638
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
>> WHEN YOU SAY TO VOTERS, YEAH

2639
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES TOO

2640
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
MUCH, MAYBE WE SHOULD STOP

2641
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
HAVING SOCIAL SECURITY OR CUT

2642
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
BECOME ON MEDICARE, OR WHAT

2643
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
ABOUT FOOD STAMPS OR

2644
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
UNEMPLOYMENT.
THEY SAY, NO, NO DON'T DO THAT,

2645
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
PLEASE, NO WE DON'T WANT TO DO

2646
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
THAT.
SOMEBODY HAS TO MAKE TOUGH

2647
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
DECISIONS.
>> ON THE EXCHANGES I DO WANT TO

2648
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
MAKE THE POINT LIKE 25 STATES

2649
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
HAVE DECIDED NOT TO -- ABOUT

2650
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
HALF OF THE STATES HAVE DECIDE.

2651
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
BILL: 19 OFFICIALLY I THINK.

2652
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
>> THERE ARE SOME UNDECIDED AS

2653
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
OF TODAY.
BILL: IT COULD GO TO 25, YOU'RE

2654
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
RIGHT, CONTINUE.

2655
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
>> IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT POLITICS,

2656
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
IT'S ABOUT ACTUAL TECHNICAL

2657
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
ABILITY TO SET THIS THING UP.

2658
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NO

2659
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
SIGN OF WHAT ITS FEDERAL

2660
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
EXCHANGE WILL LOOK LIKE.

2661
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
THE FEDERAL DATA HUB YOU'RE

2662
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
SUPPOSED TO PLUG INTO HAS NOT

2663
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
YET BEEN CREATED, THAT'S WHY

2664
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT

2665
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO DO.

2666
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
AS A MATTER OF LOGISTICS THIS IS

2667
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
VERY COSTLY, TOUGH, AND THE

2668
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY THE WAY

2669
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
FOR POLITICAL REASONS DID NOT

2670
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
GIVE PEOPLE EVEN THE

2671
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
REQUIREMENTS FOR AN EXCHANGE

2672
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
HEALTHCARE PLAN UNTIL A WEEK AND

2673
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
A HALF AGO.

2674
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
AND SO NOW THESE GUYS ARE HAVING

2675
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
TO SET THIS UP IN NINE MONTHS.

2676
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
BILL: GOOD LUCK WITH THAT,

2677
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
JUAN.

2678
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
I'LL GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD

2679
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
HERE.
>> THIS TO ME IS AN ARGUMENT FOR

2680
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
STATES SAYING, HERE IS WHAT WE

2681
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
WANT TO DO, HERE IS HOW WE WANT

2682
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
TO DO IT AND USING THEIR VOICE,

2683
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
THEIR POWER.

2684
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
BILL: THEY ARE.

2685
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
>> WHICH IS THE ARGUMENT IN THE

2686
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
CONGRESS FROM THE REPUBLICANS

2687
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
OPPOSING THE BILL SAYING WE WANT

2688
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
STATES TO HAVE MORE AUTHORITY

2689
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
AND SET THEIR OWN STANDARDS AND

2690
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
THAT WAS INSISTED UPON BY

2691
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
REPUBLICANS, IT WAS A POINT THAT

2692
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
WAS CONCEDED BY DEMOCRATS AND

2693
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
NOW YOU HAVE THE REPUBLICAN

2694
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
GOVERNORS OUT OF SPITE SAYING WE

2695
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
ARE NOT GOING TO COOPERATE AND

2696
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
IT'S THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S

2697
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
PROBLEM.
>> THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL

2698
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
GOVERNMENT HANDLED THIS

2699
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
INCOMPETENTLY, THEY HAVEN'T

2700
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
GIVEN ANYONE THE STANDARDS TO

2701
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
ACTUALLY BUILD THIS THING.

2702
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
BILL: YOU'LL GET A REAL CONTRAST

2703
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
OVERT NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS,

2704
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
WHETHER THE HEALTH EXCHANGE IS A

2705
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
GOOD IDEA OR A BAD IDEA, WE'LL

2706
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
MEASURE IT STATE-BY-STATE.

2707
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
BY THE WAY, 42% SAY IT'S GOING

2708
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
TO BE A GOOD YEAR IN 2013.

2709
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,000
41% SAY IT'S A BAD YEAR.

2710
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
BOOM.
>> DO YOU THINK WE ARE A DIVIDED

2711
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
COUNTRY.
BILL: RIGHT ON, SEE YOU JUAN,

2712
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,000
SEE YOU MARY CATHERINE.

2713
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND.

2714
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
ALISYN: WE HAVE A FEW UPDATES TO

2715
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
THE BREAKING NEWS WE HAVE BEEN

2716
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
REPORTED FOR THE PAST FEW

2717
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
MINUTES, THAT IS A POSSIBLE

2718
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
SHOOTING AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

2719
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, 50,

2720
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
60 MILES NORTH OF NEW YORK

2721
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
CITY.
THE NEW INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE

2722
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
IS THAT THE SHOOTING WAS

2723
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000

FOURTH AT 9:41AM, THE SCHOOL

2726
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
OPENS AT 9:00AM EVERY DAY.

2727
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
THIS IS ACCORDING TO STATE

2728
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
POLICE.

2729
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,000
"THE TWO TOWN B IS REPORTING

2730
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
MULTIPLE POLICE AND AMBULANCES

2731
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
ARE AT THE SCENE, THEY SAY THERE

2732
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
ARE MULTIPLE REPORTS OF

01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
INJURIES.

2734
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM

2735
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
THIS YET.
OUR LOCAL FOX AFFILIATE SAYS

2736
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000

01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
WHEN FOX NEWS CALLED A MOMENT

2920
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
AGO SAID THEY HAVE TWO

2921
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,000
AMBULANCES ON THE SCENE, AND

2922
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:39,000
THAT WHAT THE WHAT WATERBURY IS

2923
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
SENDING PWHRAEPBS AS WELL.

2924
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
THE REPORT THEY HAVE IS ONE

2925
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
TEACHER HAS A FOOT INJURY AFTER

2926
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
BEING SHOT IN THE FOOT.

2927
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL.

2928
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
IT IS THEIR INFORMATION THAT

2929
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
POLICE ARE CLEARING THE SCENE.

2930
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,000
SO PUT THAT TOGETHER AND TRY AND

2931
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

2932
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
ALISYN: VERY SCARY STUFF.

2933
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
WE HAVE BEEN ON THE PHONE ALSO

2934
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
WITH THE NEWTOWN POLICE

2935
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
DEPARTMENT AND OUR PRODUCERS

2936
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
REPORT THAT IT JUST SOUNDS VERY

2937
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
CHAOTIC THERE.

2938
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE THEM FIELDING

2939
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
ALL SORTS OF CALLS FROM OTHER

2940
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
SCHOOLS IN THE AREA, FROM

2941
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
PARENTS, FROM THE MEDIA WANTING

2942
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
INFORMATION.
THEY ARE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN

2943
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF

2944
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,000
INFORMATION YET, OTHER THAN TO

2945
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
SAY THAT WE DO KNOW THE SCHOOL

2946
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
IS ON LOCKDOWN, AND THAT KIDS

2947
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:22,000
AND AT LEAST PARENTS HAVE

2948
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,000
ASSEMBLED OUTSIDE, AND WE DON'T

2949
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
KNOW THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

2950
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
INJURIES OR HOW MANY THERE HAVE

2951
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
BEEN.
THERE WERE INITIAL REPORTS OF

2952
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,000
MULTIPLE INJURIES, BUT OF COURSE

2953
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
IN BREAKING NEWS IT'S HARD TO

2954
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
KNOW IF THOSE ARE ACCURATE.

2955
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
BILL: WE DON'T HAVE THE

2956
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,000
INFORMATION WE NEED RIGHT NOW TO

2957
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED,

2958
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
BUT THE MIND RUNS WILD HERE IF

2959
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
YOU HAVE A TEACHER SHOT IN THE

2960
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
FOOT AND THE SUPERINTENDENT'S

2961
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
SECRETARY SAYS THE REPORTS OF A

2962
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
SHOOTING ARE NOT CONFIRMED.

2963
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
IF THAT'S THE CASE DID THE

2964
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
TEACHER SHOOT HIM OR HERSELF?

2965
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
WE DON'T KNOW THE CHILDREN ARE

2966
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
OUTSIDE, AND YOU CAN IMAGINE

2967
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
PARENTS NOW UP AND DOWN THE

2968
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
SOUTHWESTERN CONNECTICUT

2969
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000

AS OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES.

2980

2984
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:25,000

SOME OF THE STUDENTS APPARENTLY

3015
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000

IF THOSE ARE PARENTS SHOWING UP

01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000

01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,000

IN ONE ROOM HAD NUMEROUS GUNSHOT

3043
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
WOUNDS.

3044
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,000
THIS WAS APPARENTLY, ACCORDING

3045
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
TO POLICE, THEY HAVE REPORTED

3046
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
THAT A SHOOTER WAS IN THE MAIN

01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000

3048
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS AN

3049
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
EMPLOYEE OF THE SCHOOL, WE DON'T

3050
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
KNOW IF IT'S A PARENT AT THE

3051
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
SCHOOL, WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS

3052
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
A STRANGER AT THE SCHOOL, BUT

3053
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,000
THAT NUMEROUS GUNSHOT WOUNDS

3054
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
WERE REPORTED.

3055
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
NOW OF COURSE I MEAN IT'S JUST

3056
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,000
SO TERRIFYING ANY TIME YOU HEAR

3057
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
THAT THERE ARE GROUPS OF

3058
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
STUDENTS WHO ARE TERRIFIED AND

01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
HOLDING HANDS AND EITHER HIDING

OUT -- OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL.

3062
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,000
BUT THEY ARE BEING ESCORTED BY

3063
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
AUTHORITIES, SOMETIMES THEIR

3064
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
TEACHERS.

3065
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
IT'S HARD TO KNOW AGAIN WITH

3066
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000

3067
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000

ON THE LOOSE AS THESE INITIAL

3069
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000

BILL: NUMEROUS GUNSHOT WOUND AT

3071
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
LEAST TO ONE PERSON.

3072
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
IF THAT'S THE CASE AND THAT

3073
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
STORY HOLDS UP THIS COULD BE A

3074
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
TARGETED SHOOTING INSIDE THIS

3075
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

3083
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
BUT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ITSELF

3084
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000

3085
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
IT'S A PRETTY LARGE DISTRICT.

3086

SQUARES, CHURCHES ON CORNERS

3096
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:42,000
WITH PRETTY OLD STEEPLES.

3097
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,000
PARTS OF IT ARE HISTORIC.

3098
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,000
IT SHOWS THAT THIS SORT OF

3099
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
