THE SCHOOL.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
NOT UNEXPECTED DETAILS.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
WE KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO BE

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
HORRIBLE BUT THE EXTENT OF THE

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
DETAIL WAS CLINICAL.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
THREE-LEN GUN SHOT WOUNDS AND

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
THOSE ARE THE FOLKS HE HAD A

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
CHANCE TO EXAMINE HIMSELF.

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
HE PARTICIPATED IN 7 OF THE

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
EXAMS PERSONALLY.

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THE PAPERWORK IS COMPLETED AND

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
NOW, IT IS TIME FOR THE

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
FAMILIES TO HAVE A CHANCE TO

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
VERY LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY FOR

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THE COMMUNITY.

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
GOVERNOR.
>> MOLLY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
>> MAYBE IT IS SIMPLEP THE

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
ATTEMPT TO EXPRESS OUR

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
COLLECTIVE SHOCK WHEN WE SAY

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THE HORRIFIC SHOOTING IN THE

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
SANDY HOOKS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
IT IS IT NOT SENSE TO A

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
RATIONAL HUMAN BEING.

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
THE GOVERNOR MALLOY GOT IT

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
RIGHT WHEN HE SAID ERIL

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
VISITED THE COMMUNITY.

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE MORE AS

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
A PARENT THAN A POLITICIAN AND

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
QUOTED THE BIBLE TO BRING

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
COMFORT TO THE NATION.

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
CHURCHES WERE FILLED IN

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT LAST

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
NIGHT AS CANDLELIGHT VIGILS

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
WERE HELD TO GRIEVE FOR THE 27

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
INNOCENT PEOPLE KILLED AND

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
THOSE SHATTERED BY THE CRAZED

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
CARNAGE.

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
ON FRIDAY, NEAL CAVUTED ME,

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
WHERE WAS GOD IN WE HAVE

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
SYSTEMATICALLY REMOVED GOD

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
FROM OUR SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
ACCOUNT ACTIVITIES AND AT THE

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
MOMENT OF THE CALAMITY WE

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
WONDER WHERE IT WAS.

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
THE LIBERAL WAVE HAD A VIOLENT

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
AND JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
THAT IF I SAID PRAYER WAS IN

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
SCHOOL THE SHOOTING WOULD NOT

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
HAVE HAPPEN.

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I SAID NOTHING OF THE SORT.

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
IT IS FAR MORE THAN PRAYER AND

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
BIBLE READING.
IT IS IT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE

126
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
SUE A CITY SO WE HAVE NO MAJOR

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
16 OR CHRISTMAS CAROL CHURCHES

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
AND CHRISTIAN OWNED BUSINESSES

129
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
ARE TOLD TO SURRENDER THE

130
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
VALUES UNDER THE EDICT OF THE

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
GOVERNMENT ORDERS TO PROVIDE

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
TAX-FUNDED ABORTION PILLS .

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
WE SAY THINGS ARE SINFUL AND

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
SAY THEY ARE DISORDERS AND

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
SOMETIMES WE SAY THEY ARE

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
NORMAL AND HAVE TO ABANDON BED

137
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
ROCK MEMIORAL TRUTHS, WE WERE,

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
WHERE WAS GOD?

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
WHY ESCORTED HIM OUT OF OUR

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
CULTURE AND MARCHED HIM OUT OF

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THE PUBLIC SQUARE AND THEN

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
SURPRISED THAT A CULTURE

143
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
REFLECTS WHAT IT IS IT BECOME.

144
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
AS SOON AS THE TRAGEDY

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
UNFOLDED HE SHOWED UP.

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
IN THE LIVES OF TEACHERS WHO

147
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
PUT THEIR LIVES BETWEEN THE

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
GUNMEN AND THE STUDENTS AND IN

149
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
POLICEMEN WHO RUSH SCHOOL NOT

150
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
KNOWING IF THEY WOULD BE MET

151
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
WITH A BARAGE OF STUDENTS.

152
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
AND HUGS AND TIERCE OF PARENTS

153
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
AND TEACHERS THAT LIVED

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
THROUGH THE SLAUGHTER AND

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
OVERFLOWED CHURCH SERVICES

156
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
WHERE PEOPLE LIT CANDLES AND

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
PRAYED HE SHOWED UP IN THE

158
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
WHITE HOUSE WHERE THE

159
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
PRESIDENT ENVOKED HIS NAME AND

160
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
QUOTED FROM HIS BOOK THEN IN A

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
FEW DAYS, WE'LL GOD TO EXCUSE

162
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
HIMSELF.
AND ANNOUNCE IN OUR ARROGANT

163
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
PRIDE THAT WE HAVE EVOLVED

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
BEYOND NEEDING HIM AND SOMEONE

165
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WILL SUGGEST WE HAVE A LAW TO

166
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
STOP THIS.

167
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
WE DON'T HAVE TO PASS A NEW

168
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
ONE.

169
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
THERE IS ONE THAT WORKS IF WE

170
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
TEACH AND OBSERVE IT.

171
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
SHAW SHALT NOT KILL.

172
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THERE ARE NINE OTHERS.

173
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
BUT TO TELL THEM ABOUT THAT

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
WOULD REQUIRE BRINGING GOD

175
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
BACK AND WE KNOW HOW

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
UNACCEPTABLE THAT MIGHT BE.

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
GERALDO RIVARY IS STANDING BY

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
IN NEWTOWN, BUT MORE

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
IMPORTANTLY GERALDO, I CAN'T

180
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
THINK OF ANY MAJOR AMERICAN

181
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
TRANNEL DEE THAT YOU HAVE NOT

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
SEEN UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL IN

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
THE LAST 40 YEARS.

184
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
HOW DOES THIS ONE COMPARE TO

185
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
THE TRAGIC EVENTS THAT YOU

186
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
COVER AS A REPORTER IN THE

187
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
PAST FOUR DECADES.

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
>> GOVERNOR, LET ME IF I MAY,

189
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000

HE'S OKAY HE'S RIGHT HERE AND

379
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
GOT HIM OFF OF THE GROUND AND

380
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
GAY HIM TO ME.

381
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000

AROUND THE EMOTION THAT YOU

385
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
MUST HAVE HAD WHEN YOU SAW

386
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
YOUR SON WAS OKAY.

387
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I AM ASSUMING YOU GRABBED HIM

388
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
AND HUGGED HIM ALMOST TO THE

389
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
POINT OF SQUEEZING THE AIR OUT

390
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000

391
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I DONE CRY.

393
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I WAS BRAVE.

394
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
AND YOU KNOW, I AM OKAY.

395
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
AND I SAID OKAY.

396
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
AND PASSED HIM TO MY HUSBAND

397
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
SO HE COULD HUG HIM AND THEN

398
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
MY THOUGHTS WENT TO ONE OF MY

399
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000

400
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
KNEW WAS AT WORK AND I

401
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO LOOK

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
FOR HER AND FOUND HER AND TOOK

403
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000

404
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
AND TOLD HER MANAGER ON THE

405
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
PHONE WITH HER MOTHER.

406
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
NTHAT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE HAPPY

407
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000

WHAT HAPPENED.

416
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
THAT IS A HORRIBLE THING TO

EXPLAIN SOMETHING SO HEINOUS

418
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE

509
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
UNDERSTAND.

510
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
WHEN THE POLICE OFFICERS FIRST

511
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
AROUND ON THE SCREEN LIKE THEY

512
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
DID IN SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

513
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY MAY

514
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
FACE.
THEY MAY FACE ONE GUN OR FIVE

515
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
GUNS OR EXPLOSIVES.

516
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
THEY RUN IN UATION WHERE THEY

00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
MAY HAVE TO MAKE A SPLIT

00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
ACT THE LIVES OF KIDS.

>> IT IS TRUE.

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
YOU NIVER CAN FULLY PREPARE

522
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT

523
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
THE SCENARIO IS.

524
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
WE HAVE EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS

525
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
FOR THESE SHOOTERS.

526
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
AND THIS IS WHAT THE SITUATION

527
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
WAS.

528
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
AND WE HAVE POLICE OFFICERS

529
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
AND DETECTIVES AND UNITS THAT

530
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
TRAIN FOR THIS ALL OF THE TIME

531
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
FOR THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO.

532
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
AND SO WHEN THEY TURN OUT.

533
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
THEY ESTABLISH A PERIMETER AND

534
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
SET UP A MOBILE COMMAND BASE

535
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
AND PLOY THE TROOPS AND VET

536
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
INFORMATION AS IT COMES IN.

537
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
AND THEY WILL USUALLY WORK IN

538
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
A MINIMUM OF FOUR TEEMS THAT

539
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
GO THROUGH THE DOOR AND DO A

540
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
GRID SEARCH.
AND MAYBE THEY WILL ACCESS TO

541
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
POIGNS OF THE BUILDING AND

542
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
BEING AWARE OF THE CROSS FIRE

543
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
SCENARIO TO STAY AWAY FROM

544
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
THAT.
THEY GO IN AND THEY DON'T KNOW

545
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
IF THE DOORS ARE BOOBY TRAPPED

546
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
OR IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE

547
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000

548
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
AND THOSE PEOPLE MAY NOT HAVE

00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
ALL OF THE INFORMATION.

550
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
AFTER COLUMBINE.

551
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENTS, AS IN

553
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000

554
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
TO ASSESS WHAT WAS GOING O.

555
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
AND THE PROTOCALL IS YOU GO IN

556
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
AND TRY TO GET TO THE SHOOTER

557
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

558
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
AND THAT MEEPS THE FIRST GUYS

559
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
IN THERE ARE PUTTING THEIR IN

560
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000

OTHER SIDE.

567
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
YOU WORK OUT A PLAN BEFORE

568
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000

569
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
YOUR STRAT STRAT ON --

STRATEGY ON THE RUN.

571
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
24 HOURS PASSED BEFORE THE

572
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
BODIES WERE REMOVED AND A LOT

573
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
OF INTENSE FORENSIC WORK WAS

574
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000

575
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
IT THAT THE POLICE ARE DOING

576
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
BEHIND THE CLOSED DOORS,

577
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
OBVIOUSLY NO CAMERAS ARE GOING

578
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
IN THERE AND NO ONE WILL GET

579
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
IN THERE IS IT EVAPORATE THAT

580
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
YOU TABE YOUR CRIME SCENE.

581
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
IT WAS A CONTAINED CRIME 69

582
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
AND BEHIND THE SCENES, THEY

583
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
ARE LOOKING AT THE PROCESS IN

584
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
THE CRIME SCENE AND FOREPSICS

585
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
THAT THEY ARE RECOVERING.

586
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
MATCHING THOSE ROUNDS TO THE

587
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
GUN.

588
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IF

589
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
YOU ARE FINDING A ROUND.

590
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
AND NO GUN.

591
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
IS THERE A SECOND SHOOTER IN

592
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
THE BUILDING OR MAYBE -- OUT

593
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
IN THE WORLD.

594
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
THAT YOU KNOW, NOW IS STILL A

595
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
THREAT TO OTHERS.

596
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000

TABING ONE OR TWO SHOOTERSMENT

604
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
