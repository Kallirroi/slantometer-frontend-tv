MOTHERS OR SISTERS, OUR BROTHERS

185
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000

HOLY GOD, MANY OF THESE MEN AND

383
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
WOMEN YOU CALLED INTO SERVICE

384
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
WHEN THEY WERE JUST CHILDREN.

385
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
THEY WANTED TO BE POLICE

386
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS AND

387
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
CARE FOR THOSE THAT WERE IN

388
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
NEED, LORD.

389
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
YOU GAVE THEM GIFTS FOR THEIR

390
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
LIFE TO SERVE.

391
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
YOU ASKED THEM TO PAY A HIGH

392
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
PRICE FOR ALL THE SKILLS THAT

393
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN, FOR THE

394
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
STRENGTH THAT THEY HAVE.

395
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
YOU EQUIPPED THEM.

396
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
YOU GAVE THEM A WILLINGNESS TO

397
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
LEARN, TO TRAIN, TO STUDY.

398
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
YOU GAVE THEM A WILLINGNESS TO

399
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
SERVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

400
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
WHEN A CALL WOULD COME IN.

401
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
AND YOU GAVE THEM THE

402
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
WILLINGNESS TO RESPOND WHEN THIS

403
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
TOWN NEEDED THEM THE MOST.

404
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
LORD, WE THANK YOU FOR THOSE IN

405
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
THIS TOWN THAT RESPONDED, BUT WE

406
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
THANK YOU ALSO FOR THOSE

407
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT CAME

408
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
WHEN THE NEED WAS GIVEN.

409
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
WE THANK YOU, LORD, FOR THEIR

410
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000

412
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
SO WE ASK YOU, LORD, TO WALK

413
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
SURROUND THEM WITH YOUR ANGELS,

415
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
TO GIVE THEM PEOPLE WHO WILL

416
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
LISTEN TO THEIR STORY, TO LISTEN

417
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
TO WHAT THEY SAW THAT WAS NOT

418
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
FOR ANYONE TO EVER SEE.

419
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
LORD, WE PLACE EACH AND EVERY

420
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
ONE OF THESE MEN AND WOMEN IN

421
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
YOUR CARE, BUT WE WILL BE

SISTERS, THE GRANDPARENTS.

431
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
FOR ALL OF YOU TODAY.

432
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
THIS IS A SACRED TEXT FROM THE

433
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
BAHA'I FAITH.

434
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
IT WAS WRITTEN AS A LETTER TO A

435
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
MOTHER WHO WAS MOURNING THE LOSS

436
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
OF HER CHILD.

437
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'VE ADAPTED IT FOR THIS

438
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
EVENING.

439
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
ALTHOUGH THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS

440
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
INDEED HEARTBREAKING AND BEYOND

441
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
THE LIMITS OF HUMAN ENDURANCE,

442
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
YET ONE WHO KNOWETH AND

443
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
UNDERSTANDETH IS ASSURED THAT

444
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
THE CHILD HAD NOT BEEN LOST, BUT

RATHER HAVE STEPPED FROM THIS

446
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
WORLD INTO ANOTHER, AND YOU WILL

447
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
FIND THEM IN THE DEVINE REALM.

448
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
THAT REUNION SHALL BE FOR

449
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
ETERNITY, WHILE IN THIS WORLD,

450
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
SEPARATION IS INEVITABLE AND

451
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
BRINGETH WITH IT A BURNING

452
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
GRIEF.

453
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
PRAISE BE UNTO GOD THAT THOU HAS

454
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
FAITH.

455
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
TURNING THY FAITH TO THE

456
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
EVERLASTING KINGDOM AND BELIEVE

THEREFORE, BE THOUGH NOT

DO NOT LANGUISH.

>> THAT BELOVED CHILD ADDRESS

468
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
FROM THE HIDDEN WORLD.

469
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
OH, THOU KIND MOTHER AND FATHER,

470
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
THANK DEVINE PROVIDENCE THAT I

HAVE BEEN FREED FROM A SMALL AND

472
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
GLOOMY CAGE, AND LIKE THE BIRDS

473
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
OF THE MEADOWS, HAVE SOARED TO

474
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
THE DEVINE WORLD, A WORLD WHICH

475
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
IS SPACIOUS, ILLUMINED AND EVER

476
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
JOYOUS AND JUBILANT.

477
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
THEREFORE, LAMENT NOT, OH,

478
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
MOTHER AND FATHER, AND BE NOT

479
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
GRIEVED.

480
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I AM NOT OF THE LOST, NOR HAVE I

481
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
BEEN OBLITERATED AND DESTROYED.

482
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I HAVE SHAKEN OFF THE MORTAL

483
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
FORM AND HAVE RAISED MY BANNER

484
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
IN THIS SPIRITUAL WORLD.

485
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
FOLLOWING THIS SEPARATION IS

486
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000

499
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
THE COUNSELORS AND THE CLERGY

500
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
AND ALL THE CAREGIVERS AMONG US.

501
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
THEY HAVE GREAT PASSION FOR WHAT

502
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
THEY DO AND WHEN EVERYONE DOES

503
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
THEIR PASSION, WE ARRIVE AT

504
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
COMPASSION, AND WE THANK YOU.

505
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE MOST AWARE

506
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
OF THEIR NEEDS.

507
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
THEY, TOO, BECOME TIRED AND

508
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
SOMETIMES CLOSE TO BURNING OUT.

509
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
HOW MUCH WE NEED ONE ANOTHER.

510
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
WHEN YOU CALL JEREMIAH OR AMOS

511
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
OR BARUK AND ALL YOUR PRECIOUS

512
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
APOSTLES AND PROPHETS, THEY

513
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
HEDGED AT FIRST.

514
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
BUT EACH TIME, IN TURN, THEY

515
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
GAVE THEIR YES AND THEY FOLLOWED

516
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
YOU.

517
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
KNOWING THAT YOU WERE ALWAYS

518
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
AMONG THEM, ALWAYS SUPPORTING

519
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
THEM.

520
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
THEY WERE CONDUITS FOR YOUR EYES

521
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
AND YOUR EARS AND YOUR VOICE AND

522
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
YOUR HANDS.

523
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
THEY WERE THE CLAY KNOWING THAT

524
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
YOU ALWAYS WERE THE POTTER, AND

525
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
THEY WERE RESILIENT IN YOUR

526
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
HANDS.

527
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
WHEN JESUS FELT THE NEED TO GET

528
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
AWAY FOR SOME RESPITE HIMSELF,

529
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
HE WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS OR INTO

530
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
THE WILDERNESS OR OUT TO THE

531
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
SEASHORE, AND THE GREAT NUMBERS

FOLLOWED.

534
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
TIRED AND DRAINED AS HE WAS, HE

535
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
LOOKED ON THEM WITH COMPASSION.

536
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
ANOINT ALL YOUR PEOPLE, LORD,

00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
WE ARE ALSO A PLACE THAT HAS

562
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
GREAT PRIDE IN OUR SCHOOLS,

563
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
PRIDE THAT PROPELS THE STUDENTS

564
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
IN THOSE SCHOOLS WITH THEIR

565
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
OUTSTANDING TEACHERS AND

566
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000

568
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
WORTH.
THE HORROR THAT WAS VISITED UPON

569
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
OUR SANDY HOOK SCHOOL WAS NOT

570
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
DESERVED.

571
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
IT IS THE ANGRY AND DESPERATE

572
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
ACT OF A CONFUSED YOUNG MAN.

573
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
THERE IS NO BLAME TO BE LAID ON

574
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
US, BUT THERE IS A GREAT BURDEN

575
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
AND A GREAT CHALLENGE THAT WE

576
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
EMERGE WHOLE, THAT THESE

577
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
FAMILIES DEVASTATED BY

578
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
UNSPEAKABLE HARM KNOW AND TRUST

579
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
THAT WE LOVE THEM AND WILL DO

580
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP THEM

581
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
HEAL.

582
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I KNOW THAT NEWTOWN WILL

583
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
PREVAIL, THAT WE WILL NOT FALL

584
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
TO ACTS OF VIOLENCE.

585
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
IT IS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR OUR

586
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
TOWN, BUT IT DOES NOT DEFINE US.

587
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
WE ARE NEWTOWN, A SPECIAL AND

588
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
CARING PLACE.

589
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
WE ARE DEFINED BY ACTS OF

590
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
COURAGE, BY ACTS OF LOVE, AND BY

591
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
OUR CONTINUING COMMITMENT AND

592
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
LOVE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND

593
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
FAMILIES.

594
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
IT IS MY PLEASURE, LADIES AND

595
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
GENTLEMEN, TO PRESENT TO YOU

596
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000

>> PAT, THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE

599
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
GREAT WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE

600
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
FOR THIS COMMUNITY IN THE LAST

601
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
THREE DAYS, TO THE POLICE CHIEF,

602
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
AND TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

603
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
GREAT SERVICE, AS WELL AS TO ALL

605
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS.

606
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
THANK YOU.

607
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
WHEN I CAME IN TO THE HALL, ONE

608
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
OF THE FIRST SONGS TO BE PLAYED

609
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
ON THE PIANO WAS "AMAZING

610
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
GRACE," WHICH IS FITTING FOR ANY

611
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
NUMBER OF REASONS.

612
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
IT'S BECOME AN ANTHEM FOR FIRST

613
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
RESPONDERS, IT HAS GREAT WORDS,

614
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
IT ALSO SPEAKS OF THE POWER OF

615
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
FAITH.

616
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
"AMAZING GRACE" WAS WRITTEN BY A

617
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
FORMER SEA CAPTAIN ENGAGED IN

618
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
THE SLAVE TRADE.

619
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
AND THOSE PROFOUND WORDS THAT "I

620
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
ONCE WAS LOST BUT NOW AM FOUND"

621
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
SPEAK TO US ON A DAY LIKE TODAY.

622
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
WHEN WE ARE CALLED UPON, DARE I

623
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
SAY REQUIRED TO BE INVESTED IN

624
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
OUR FAITH, A FAITH SO EVIDENT IN

625
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
THIS ROOM AND IN THIS COMMUNITY

626
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
AT THIS TIME.

627
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
A FAITH THAT IS, AFTER ALL, AT

628
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
ITS VERY CORE, A GIFT FROM GOD.

629
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
A FAITH IN WHICH WE FIND COMFORT

630
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
AND HOPE AND COMPASSION.

631
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
A FAITH IN WHICH WE ARE GIVEN

632
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
THE POWER TO GO ON.

633
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
TO SURVIVE THAT WHICH HAS

634
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
BEFALLEN THIS COMMUNITY, THESE

635
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
FAMILIES, THESE SPOUSES, THAT

636
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
WHICH HAS HAPPENED AND IS

637
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
UNIMAGINABLE AND UNTHINKABLE AND

638
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
WAS NEVER, WE THOUGHT, INTENDED

639
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
TO BE VISITED UPON US HERE IN

640
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
CONNECTICUT OR IN NEWTOWN OR IN

641
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
SANDY HOOK.

642
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I CHOOSE TO THINK ABOUT THE FACT

643
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
THAT IN THE COMING DAYS WE WILL

644
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
OFFICIALLY ENTER WINTER.

645
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
AND THAT IS ALWAYS TO BE

646
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
FOLLOWED BY THE SPRING.

647
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT IN

648
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
WINTER, EACH TIME I SEE THE

649
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
BEGINNING OF A SNOWFALL, I WILL

650
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
BE THINKING OF THOSE 27 SOULS

651
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
LOST JUST A FEW DAYS AGO.

652
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
EACH TIME THE DAY GETS A LITTLE

653
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
LONGER, I WILL THINK AND DREAM

654
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
OF THE LIVES THAT MIGHT HAVE

655
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
BEEN AND THE LIVES THAT WERE SO

656
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
FULL OF GRACE.

657
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
AND WHEN THE FLOWERS START TO

658
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
COME OUT OF THE GROUND, AND WHEN

659
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
THEY RISE UP, I WILL KNOW THAT

660
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
WE ARE IN TOUCH WITH THOSE THAT

661
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
WE HAVE LOST IN THE LAST FEW

662
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
DAYS.

663
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
WE WILL GO ON.

664
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
WE WILL FIND STRENGTH.

665
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
FAITH IS A GIFT, AS IS OUR

666
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
ABILITY TO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER

667
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
IN OUR GREATER COMMUNITY.

00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
TO ALL OF YOU, I EXTEND MY MOST

669
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000

672
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
HAVE WITNESSED, AND WHAT YOU

673
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
HAVE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED.

00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
WE WILL MOVE ON, WE WILL NEVER

675
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
FORGET, WE WILL IN MANY WAYS BE

676
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
MADE STRONGER FOR WHAT HAS

677
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
TRANSPIRED, AND WE WILL GET

678
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
BETTER.

00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000

GLORY THAT FAR OUTWEIGHS THEM

708
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
ALL, SO WE FIX OUR EYES NOT ON

709
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
WHAT IS SEEN, BUT ON WHAT IS

710
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
UNSEEN.

711
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
SINCE WHAT IS SEEN IS TEMPORARY,

712
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
BUT WHAT IS UNSEEN IS ETERNAL.

713
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
FOR WE KNOW THAT IF THE EARTHLY

714
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
TENT WE LIVE IN IS DESTROYED, WE

715
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
HAVE A BUILDING FROM GOD, AN

716
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
ETERNAL HOUSE IN HEAVEN NOT

717
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
BUILT BY HUMAN HANDS.

718
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
WE GATHER HERE IN MEMORY OF 20

719
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN AND SIX

720
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
REMARKABLE ADULTS.

721
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
THEY LOST THEIR LIVES IN A

722
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
SCHOOL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY

723
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
SCHOOL IN A QUIET TOWN FULL OF

724
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
GOOD AND DECENT PEOPLE THAT

725
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
COULD BE ANY TOWN IN AMERICA.

729
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I AM VERY MINDFUL THAT MERE

730
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
WORDS CANNOT MATCH THE DEPTHS OF

731
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
YOUR SORROW, NOR CAN THEY HEAL

732
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
YOUR WOUNDED HEARTS.

733
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I CAN ONLY HOPE IT HELPS FOR YOU

734
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN

735
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
YOUR GRIEF.

736
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
THAT OUR WORLD, TOO, HAS BEEN

00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
WE'VE PULLED OUR CHILDREN TIGHT,

00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
AND YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHATEVER

742
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
MEASURE OF COMFORT WE CAN

00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
PROVIDE, WE WILL PROVIDE.

00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
WHATEVER PORTION OF SADNESS THAT

745
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU TO EASE

746
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
THIS HEAVY LOAD, WE WILL GLADLY

747
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
BEAR IT.
NEWTOWN, YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

748
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
AS THESE DIFFICULT DAYS HAVE

749
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
UNFOLDED, YOU'VE ALSO INSPIRED

750
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
US.

751
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
WITH STORIES OF STRENGTH AND

752
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
RESOLVE AND SACRIFICE.

753
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
WE KNOW THAT WHEN DANGER ARRIVED

754
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
IN THE HALLS OF SANDY HOOK

755
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
ELEMENTARY, THE SCHOOL'S STAFF

756
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
DID NOT FLINCH.

757
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
THEY DID NOT HESITATE.

758
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
DAWN HOCHSPRUNG AND MARY

759
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
SHERLACH, VICKI SOTO, LAUREN

760
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
RUSSEAU, RACHEL DAVINO AND

761
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
ANNE MARIE MURPHY, THEY ALL

762
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
RESPONDED IN HOW WE HOPE WE ALL

763
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
WOULD RESPOND IN SUCH TERRIFYING

764
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
CIRCUMSTANCES, WITH COURAGE AND

765
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
WITH LOVE, GIVING THEIR LIVES TO

766
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
PROTECT THE CHILDREN IN THEIR

767
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
CARE.

768
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE OTHER

769
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
TEACHERS WHO BARRICADED

770
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
THEMSELVES INSIDE CLASSROOMS AND

771
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
KEPT STEADY THROUGH IT ALL AND

772
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
REASSURED THEIR STUDENTS BY

773
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
SAYING WAIT FOR THE GOOD GUYS,

774
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
THEY ARE COMING.

775
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
SHOW ME YOUR SMILE.

776
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
AND WE KNOW THAT GOOD GUYS CAME,

777
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS WHO RACED

778
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
TO THE SCENE HELPING TO GUIDE

779
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
THOSE IN HARM'S WAY TO SAFETY

780
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
AND COMFORT THOSE IN NEED,

781
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
HOLDING AT BAY THEIR OWN SHOCK

782
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
AND THEIR OWN TRAUMA, BECAUSE

783
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
THEY HAD A JOB TO DO AND OTHERS

784
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
NEEDED THEM MORE.

785
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
AND THEN THERE WERE THE SCENES

786
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
OF THE SCHOOL CHILDREN HELPING

787
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
ONE ANOTHER, HOLDING EACH OTHER,

788
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
DUTIFULLY FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS

789
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
IN THE WAY THAT YOUNG CHILDREN

790
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
SOMETIMES DO.

791
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
ONE CHILD EVEN TRYING TO

792
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
ENCOURAGE A GROWNUP BY SAYING,

793
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
"I KNOW KARATE, SO IT'S OKAY,

794
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I'LL LEAD THE WAY OUT."

795
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
AS A COMMUNITY, YOU'VE INSPIRED

796
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
US, NEWTOWN.

797
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
IN THE FACE OF INDESCRIBABLE

798
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
VIOLENCE, IN THE FACE OF

799
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
UNCONSCIONABLE EVIL, YOU'VE

800
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
LOOKED OUT FOR EACH OTHER.

801
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
YOU'VE CARED FOR ONE ANOTHER.

802
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
AND YOU'VE LOVED ONE ANOTHER.

803
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
THIS IS HOW NEWTOWN WILL BE

804
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
REMEMBERED, AND WITH TIME AND
GOD'S GRACE, THAT LOVE WILL SEE

805
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
YOU THROUGH.

806
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
BUT WE AS A NATION, WE ARE LEFT

807
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,000
WITH SOME HARD QUESTIONS.

808
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
SOMEONE ONCE DESCRIBED THE JOY

809
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
AND ANXIETY OF PARENTHOOD AS THE

810
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
EQUIVALENT OF HAVING YOUR HEART

811
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
OUTSIDE OF YOUR BODY ALL THE

812
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
TIME, WALKING AROUND.

813
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
WITH THEIR VERY FIRST CRY, THIS

814
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
MOST PRECIOUS, VITAL PART OF

815
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
OURSELVES, OUR CHILD.

816
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
SUDDENLY EXPOSED TO THE WORLD

817
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
THE POSSIBLE MISHAP OR MALICE,

818
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
AND EVERY PARENT KNOWS THERE'S

819
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
NOTHING WE WILL NOT DO TO SHIELD

820
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
OUR CHILDREN FROM HARM, AND YET

821
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
WE ALSO KNOW THAT WITH THAT

822
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
CHILD'S VERY FIRST STEP AND EACH

823
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
STEP AFTER THAT, THEY ARE

824
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
SEPARATING FROM US.

825
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
THAT WE WON'T -- THAT WE CAN'T

826
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
ALWAYS BE THERE FOR THEM.

827
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
THEY WILL SUFFER SICKNESS AND

828
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
SETBACKS AND BROKEN HEARTS AND

829
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
DISAPPOINTMENTS, AND WE LEARN

830
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
THAT OUR MOST IMPORTANT JOB IS

831
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO

832
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
BECOME SELF RELIANT AND CAPABLE

833
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
AND RESILIENT, READY TO FACE THE

834
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
WORLD WITHOUT FEAR.

835
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
AND WE KNOW WE CAN'T DO THIS BY

836
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
OURSELVES.

837
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
IT COMES AS A SHOCK AT A CERTAIN

838
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
POINT WHERE YOU REALIZE NO

839
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
MATTER HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THESE

840
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
KIDS, YOU CAN'T DO IT BY

841
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
YOURSELF.

842
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
THAT THIS JOB OF KEEPING OUR

843
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
CHILDREN SAFE AND TEACHING THEM

844
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
WELL IS SOMETHING WE CAN ONLY DO

845
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
TOGETHER.

846
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
WITH THE HELP OF FRIENDS AND

847
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
NEIGHBORS, THE HELP OF A

848
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
COMMUNITY AND THE HELP OF A

849
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
NATION.

850
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
AND IN THAT WAY WE COME TO

851
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
REALIZE THAT WE BEAR

852
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERY CHILD,

853
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
BECAUSE WE'RE COUNTING ON

854
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
EVERYBODY ELSE TO HELP LOOK

855
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
AFTER OURS.

856
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
THAT WE'RE ALL PARENTS, THAT

857
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
THEY ARE ALL OUR CHILDREN.

858
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
THIS IS OUR FIRST TASK, CARING

859
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
FOR OUR CHILDREN.

860
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
OUR FIRST JOB.

861
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
IF WE DON'T GET THAT RIGHT, WE

862
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
DON'T GET ANYTHING RIGHT.

863
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
THAT'S HOW, AS A SOCIETY, WE

864
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
WILL BE JUDGED.

865
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
AND BY THAT MEASURE, CAN WE

866
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
TRULY SAY, AS A NATION, THAT

867
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
WE'RE MEETING OUR OBLIGATIONS?

868
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
CAN WE HONESTLY SAY THAT WE'RE

869
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
DOING ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR

870
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
CHILDREN, ALL OF THEM, SAFE FROM

871
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
HARM?

872
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
CAN WE CLAIM, AS A NATION, THAT

873
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,000
WE'RE ALL TOGETHER THERE,

874
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
LETTING THEM KNOW THEY ARE LOVED

875
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
AND TEACHING THEM TO LOVE IN

876
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
RETURN?

877
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
CAN WE SAY THAT WE'RE TRULY

878
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
DOING ENOUGH TO GIVE ALL THE

879
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
CHILDREN OF THIS COUNTRY THE

880
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
CHANCE THEY DESERVE TO LIVE OUR

881
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
THEIR LIVES IN HAPPINESS AND

882
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
WITH PURPOSE?

883
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I'VE BEEN REFLECTING ON THIS THE

884
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
LAST FEW DAYS, AND IF WE'RE

885
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
HONEST WITH OURSELVES, THE

886
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
ANSWER'S NO.

887
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH.

888
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
AND WE WILL HAVE TO CHANGE.

889
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
SINCE I'VE BEEN PRESIDENT, THIS

890
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
IS THE FOURTH TIME WE HAVE COME

891
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
TOGETHER TO COMFORT A GRIEVING

892
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
COMMUNITY TORN APART BY MASS

893
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
SHOOTINGS.

894
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
FOURTH TIME WE'VE HUGGED

895
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
SURVIVORS, THE FOURTH TIME WE'VE

896
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
CONSOLED THE FAMILIES OF

897
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
VICTIMS, AND IN BETWEEN, THERE

898
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
HAVE BEEN AN ENDLESS SERIES OF

899
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
DEADLY SHOOTINGS ACROSS THE

900
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
COUNTRY, DAILY REPORTS OF

901
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
VICTIMS, MANY OF THEM CHILDREN,

902
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
IN SMALL TOWNS AND CITIES ALL

903
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
ACROSS AMERICA.

904
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
VICTIMS WHO MUCH OF THE TIME

905
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
THEIR ONLY FAULT WAS BEING AT

906
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG

907
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
TIME.

908
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
WE CAN'T TOLERATE THIS ANYMORE.

909
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
THESE TRAGEDIES MUST END.

910
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
AND TO END THEM, WE MUST CHANGE.

911
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
WE WILL BE TOLD THAT THE CAUSES

912
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
OF SUCH VIOLENCE ARE COMPLEXED,

913
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
AND THAT IS TRUE.

914
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
NO SINGLE LAW, NO SET OF LAWS

915
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
CAN ELIMINATE EVIL FROM THE

916
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
WORLD OR PREVENT EVERY SENSELESS

917
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
ACT OF VIOLENCE IN OUR SOCIETY,

918
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
BUT THAT CAN'T BE AN EXCUSE FOR

919
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
AN ACTION.

920
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
SURELY WE CAN DO BETTER THAN
THIS.

921
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
IF THERE'S EVEN ONE STEP WE CAN
