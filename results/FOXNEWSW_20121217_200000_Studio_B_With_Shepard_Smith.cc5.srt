188
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
VERY OBVIOUSLY A CRIME SCENE BUT

189
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
HE ALSO SAID INTERESTINGLY, IT

190
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
IS LIKELY TO REMAIN A CRIME

191
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
SCENE, IN HIS WORDS, FOR MONTHS.

192
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000

TIME.

196
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
IT REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION

197
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
WHETHER SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

198
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
SCHOOL WILL EVER BE RE-OPENED.

199
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE ARGUMENTS ON

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
BOTH SIDES AND IT IS A DIFFICULT

201
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000

IN THE PAST 20 MINUTES WE HAVE

THE STATE CAPITAL IN HARTFORD IN

635
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
A FEW MOMENTS.

636
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
WE WILL BRING IT LIVE.

637
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING FOR

638
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
ANSWERS AND ARE RUNNING TO WHERE

639
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
THE DEADLY DAY BEGAN.

640
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
THAT WOULD BE THE SHOOTER'S OWN

641
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
HOME.
ADAM LANZA LIVED THERE WITH HIS

MOTHER SEVERAL TIMES IN THE HEAD

648
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
WHILE SHOW WAS STILL IN BED.

649
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
IF THERE WERE PROBLEMS BREWING

650
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
AT HOME YOU WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN

651
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
IT FROM TALKING TO HER.

652
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
SHE RARELY DISCUSSED HER

653
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
HOMELIFE BUT WAS CLEARLY DEVOTED

654
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
TO HER CHILDREN.

655
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
A SHORT TIME AGO WE GOT WORD

656
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
THAT NANCY LANZA DID NOT LIKE TO

657
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
LEAVE HER SON ALONE.

658
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
NOW, WHAT ARE YOU LEARN ABOUT

659
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
THIS RELATIONSHIP?

660
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
>> THIS INFORMATION IS REPORTED

661
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
FROM A MEDIATOR THAT HELPED

662
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
NANCY AND PETER THROUGH THEIR

663
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
2009 DIVORCE.

664
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
THEY ARE REPORTING SHE FELT SHE

665
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE THE SON

666
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
ALONE BUT THE DIVORCE WAS GOING

667
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
CALMLY AND THE TWO PEOPLE

668
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
INVOLVED HERE AGREED ON HOW

669
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
THEIR SON SHOULD BE TREATED.

670
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
THINGS WENT RATHER QUICKLY AND

671
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
SHE DID NOT GET A LOT OF

672
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
INFORMATION OR A LOT OF TALK

673
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
GOING ON ABOUT THE SON.

674
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
>>Reporter: WHAT ARE FRIENDS

675
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
SAYING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES

676
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
THAT, PERHAPS, SHE FACED AS A

677
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
MOTHER TRYING TO RAISE HER

678
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
20-YEAR-OLD SON?

679
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
>> A DIFFICULT SITUATION.

680
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
SHE DID SPEAK OPENLY ABOUT HER

681
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
SON TO HER FRIENDS AND THEY ARE

682
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
DOWN THE STREET AT A LOCAL PUB

683
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
AND THEY ARE TELLING SIMILAR

684
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
STORIES THAT HER SON WAS

685
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
STRUGGLING, AND SHE DID ENJOY

686
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
HER HOBBY, USING GUNS BUT IT

687
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
WASN'T A KEY PART OF HER LIFE.

688
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
IN OTHER WORDS USING THE GUNS

689
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
WASN'T SOMETHING SHE TALKED

690
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
ABOUT BUT THEY DO BELIEVE SHE

691
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
DID TAKE HER SON SHOOTING.

692
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
AND ANOTHER SAID IT WAS PERHAPS

693
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
A HOBBY BUT NOT AS IT IS

694
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
SOMETIMES BEING MADE OUT IN THE

695
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
PRESS.

696
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

697
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
>> SHE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED, I

698
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
THINK, AS SOME KIND OF GUN

699
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
ENTHUSIAST OR SURVIVALIST AND

700
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
THAT IS NOT THE NANCY I KNOW.

701
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I KNOW SHE HAS GUNS AND SHE

702
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
ENJOYS TARGET SHOOTING AND

703
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

704
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
IT IS NOT HER PRIMARY HOBBY.

705
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
>>Reporter: DESPITE THE FACT

706
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
THEY HAD SEVERAL TYPES OF

707
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
WEAPONS IN HER HOME.

708
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
>>Reporter: THERE IS MUCH MORE

709
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
TO LEARN.
WE WILL IN TIME.

710
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
THANK YOU, MOLLY.

711
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
ACCORDING TO ASSOCIATED PRESS

712
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
THIS HAS BREAKING NEWS WITH THE

713
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
GUN MAN'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE

714
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
GUNS IN THE HOME.

715
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
WE ARE TOLD A SPOKE MAN FROM

716
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
A.T.F. SAID THERE WERE GUNS

717
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
FIRED AT A SHOOTING RANGE OVER

718
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS BUT THERE

719
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ADAM LANZA

720
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
DID SO RECENTLY AND THERE IS NO

721
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
EVIDENCE HE SOMEHOW PRACTICED

722
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
FOR THE RAMPAGE.

723
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
READING FROM THE A.P.

724
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
INVESTIGATORS HAVE NO INDICATE

725
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
THAT THE "SHOOTINGER GAUGED IN

726
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
SHOOTING ACTIVISTS IN THE PAST

727
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
SIX MONTHS."

728
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
SO WE ARE JUST LOOKING AT THIS.

729
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
THAT IS A PICTURE FROM YEARS AGO

730
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
AS A MUCH YOUNGER MAN, AND THE

731
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO IS MORE

732
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
RECENT.

733
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
THERE ARE TWO FUNERALS THAT HAVE

734
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
TAKEN PLACE ALREADY TODAY AND

735
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
THIS WILL BE THE FIRST A VERY

736
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
LONG AND SAD WAVE OF FUNERALS.

737
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
A STATE SENATOR HAS MET WITH

738
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
GRIEVING FAMILIES AFTER THE

739
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
VIOLENCE ON FRIDAY, ATTENDING

740
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
THE VIGIL WITH THE PRESIDENT,

741
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
AND HE WAS AT THE FUNERAL TODAY

742

744
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
TO COMPREHEND THE LOSS OF 20 OF

756
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
STATE OF SHOCK AND SADNESS AND

757
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
IT IS STILL IMPOSSIBLE TO

758
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
COMPREHEND THAT SOMEONE COULD DO

759
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000

HOW DID THE MEETING GO?

960
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000

BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN TIGHTLIPPED

962
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
COULD BE A GOOD SIGN.

963

WE KNOW IT WAS LATE MORNING AND

964
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000

973
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
THAT HAS BEEN A HUGE ISSUE IN

995
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
DO YOU KNOW?

996
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
>> THAT WOULD INCLUDE $1

997
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
TRILLION IN SPENDING CUTS.

1003
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
POSSIBLY INCLUDED IS RAISING THE

1004
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
DEBT LIMIT WHICH HAS BEEN

1005
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
CRITICAL TO THE WHITE HOUSE,

1006
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
EXTENDING UNEMPLOYMENT

1007
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
INSURANCE, THE MEDICARE FIX AND

1008
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
TAX EXTENDERS AND NOW AIDES TO

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER SAID IF HE IS

1010
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
GOING TO AGREE TO INCREASE THE

1011
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
DEBT LIMIT ESSENTIALLY THERE HAS

1012
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
TO BE EQUAL CUTS OR REFORMS TO

1013
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
ENTITLEMENTS TO MATCH.

1014
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
SO HE WILL NOT JUST

1015
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE THE

1016
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
CREDIT CARD ON THE FEDERAL

1017
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
GOVERNMENT BUT SAYS THIS HAS TO

1018
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
BE EQUAL CUTS TO ENTITLEMENTS.

1019
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
>> YOU WONDER HOW MANY VOTES HE

1020
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
CAN GET THERE IN THE HOUSE OF

1021
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
REPRESENTATIVES ON THAT.

1022
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
WE WILL SOON FIND OUT.

1023
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
THANK YOU, MIKE EMANUEL.

1024
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
THAT IS A BIG STORY IN

1025
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
WASHINGTON, DC.

1026
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
THE OTHER STORY FROM THE MIDDLE

1027
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
EAST GOES TO THE HEART OF EGYPT.

1028
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
THEY ARE BRACING FOR MASSIVE

1029
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
NATION-WIDE PROTESTS TOMORROW

1030
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S PRESIDENT

1031
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
AS WELL AS THE NEWLY DRAFTED

1032
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
CONSTITUTION.
THEY ARE VOTING, REMEMBER, AND

1033
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
DEMONSTRATORS HAVE RALLIED

1034
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
AGAINST PRESIDENT MORSI RECENTLY

1035
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
WHO TRIED TO GRANT HIMSELF

1036
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
ABSOLUTE POWER.

1037
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
THE PROTESTS GREW WHEN THE

1038
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
ALLIES DRAFT ADD CONSTITUTION

1039
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
THAT WOULD GIVE HARD-LINE

1040
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
ISLAMISTS MORE SWAY IN THE

1041
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
LARGELY SECULAR ISLAMIC COUNTRY.

1042
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
REMEMBER, EGYPT OFTEN MEDIATES

1043
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
FEUDS AND PEACE TREATIES BETWEEN

1044
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
ISRAEL AND THE ENEMY AND THEY

1045
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
ARE CRITICAL TO MIDDLE EAST

1046
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
PEACE.
OVER THE WEEKEND THE

1047
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
CONSTITUTION PASSED A

1048
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
PRELIMINARY VOTE, 57 PERCENT OF

1049
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
THE BALLOT, AND THAT IS SAID TO

1050
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
BE QUITE A BIT LESS THAN THE

1051
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
PRESIDENT EXPECTED BUT THE VOTE

1052
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
WAS RIDDLED WITH IRREGULARITIES.

1053
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
BACK YOU NEGOTIATION YOU IN NOW

1054
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000

IS HOLDING A NEWS CONFERENCE IN

1056
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
HARTFORD.
WE EXPECTED THIS TO BEGIN A

1057
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
SHORT TIME AGO AND HE NOW IS

1058
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
TALKING.
WE WILL DROP IN AND HEAR WHAT HE

1059
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
HAS TO SAY.

1060
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
HERE THE GOVERNOR.

1061
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000

HAPPEN IN YOUR HOME BUT CLEARLY

1063
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
IT DID IN CONNECTICUT.

1064
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I WILL REPEAT SOMETHING I SAID

1065
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.

1066
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000

1067
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR RELATIVES,

1068
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
THE TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS

1069
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
AT THE SCHOOL WHO SURVIVED AND

1070
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I COMMENT THAT HE WAS ELOQUENT

1111
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
AND MOVING AND HEALING AND HE

1112
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
WAS POWERFUL.

1113
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I CAN SPEAK ON BEHALF OF

1114
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
EVERYONE WHEN I SAY, WE ARE

1115
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
GRATEFUL FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND

1116
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
IT IS OBVIOUS HE IS CONCERNED

1117
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
ABOUT OUR STATE AND OUR PEOPLE

1118
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
AND I AM MOST APPRECIATIVE OF

1119
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
THAT.
I THANK THE FIRST RESPONDERS.

1120
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
IT IS PRETTY CLEAR, NOW, THEIR

1121
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
VERY QUICK RESPONSE SAVED LIKES.

1122
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THEM THEY PUT

1123
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE EVERY

1124
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
SINGLE DAY AND THERE ARE DAYS

1125
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
LIKE FRIDAY WHEN THEY PUT THEIR

1126
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
LIVES ON THE LINE AND THEY

1127
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
ACTUALLY SAVE LIVES AS THEY

1128
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
CLEARLY DID ON FRIDAY.

1129
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
AS A RESULT, CHILDREN WENT HOME

1130
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
AND CONTINUED THE PREPARATIONS

1131
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS OR WILL

1132
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
CELEBRATE HANUKAH IN THE FUTURE.

1133
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
>> I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE

1134
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
ADULTS IN THE SCHOOL, THE

1135
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
TEACHERS AND THE ADMINISTRATORS,

1136
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
THOSE WHO DIES TRYING TO SAVE

1137
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
THEIR STUDENTS ARE HEROES.

1138
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
THEY GAVE THEIR LIVES SO OTHERS

1139
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
COULD LIVE.

1140
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
THIS ARE THOSE, TEACHERS WHO IN

1141
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
QUICK THINKING ACTION SAVED MANY

1142
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
LIVES.

1143
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
THEY ARE HEROES, ALSO.

1144
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
THERE ARE AT ARE A LOT OF HEROSN

1145
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
CONNECTICUT TODAY.

1146
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I SAID ON SATURDAY NIGHT I

1147
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A TIME

1148
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
FOR PUBLIC DISCUSSION AND THAT

1149
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
DISCUSSION WOULD INEST BRING

1150
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
OCCUR AS IT DOES WHEN A TRAGEDY

1151
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
LIKE THIS TAKES PLACE.

1152
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
SOME PEOPLE INTERPRETED THAT TO

1153
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
MEAN THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS

1154
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
INAPPROPRIATE FOR THOSE

1155
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
DISCUSSIONS TO TAKE PLACE.

1156
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I DO NOT THINK IT SIN

1157
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
APPROPRIATE FOR THEM TO SAKE

1158
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
PLACE.

1159
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
IN FACT, IT IS QUITE

1160
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
APPROPRIATE.
I WAS MAKING THE POINT NO MORE

1161
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
THAN 36 HOURS AFTER THE EVENT MY

1162
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
PERSONAL JOB AS GOVERNOR AT

1163
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
THAT MOMENT, WAS TO SPEAK TO THE

1164
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
PEOPLE OF CONNECTICUT ABOUT THE

1165
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
FEARS THEY FEEL, THE DAMAGE THAT

1166
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
HAS BEEN DONE, AND MY JOB WAS TO

1167
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
HELP AND CONTINUE TO HELP

1168
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
NEWTOWN AND THE ENTIRE STATE TO

1169
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
RECOVER.
WE KNOW IN OUR STATE THAT WE

1170
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
HAVE SOME OF THE TOUGHEST GUN

1171
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
LAWS OF ANY STATE IN THE NATION

1172
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
BUT WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS

1173
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
OVER AND ALL OF THE INFORMATION

1174
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
IS IN I WILL ASK A FEW

1175
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
QUESTIONS.
IS THERE A LAW, A POLICY OR

1176
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
PROCEDURE WE COULD HAVE HAD ON

1177
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
THE BOOK THAT MIGHT HAVE

1178
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
PREVENTED THIS VAT JOY?

1179
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
IT TURNS OUT CLEARLY THE ANSWER

1180
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
IS YES AND I BELIEVE IT IS YES,

1181
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
AND WE SHOULD PURSUE THAT

1182
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
STRATEGY.

1183
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
ARE WE DOING ENOUGH FROM MY

1184
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
MENTAL IT PERSPECTIVE TO REACH

1185
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
OUT TO KIDS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE

1186
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
OBVIOUSLY IN TROUBLE?

1187
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
MY SENSE IS WE ARE NOT.

1188
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT IN OUR

1189
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
OWN STATE AND OUR OWN NATION.

1190
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
>>Reporter: THAT IS THE

1191
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT WHO IS

1192
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
GOING THROUGH WHAT HE HAS BEEN

1193
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
DOING TODAY.
WHAT WE LEARNED EARLIER TODAY

1194
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
THIS ARE MANY, MANY WITNESSES

1195
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
THAT STILL HAVE TO BE

1196
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
QUESTIONED.
SOME OF THE WITNESSES ARE THE

1197
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
YOUNG CHILDREN WHO SURVIVED

1198
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
INSIDE THE SCHOOL, THE

1199
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
CONNECTICUT POLICE TOLD ME EARLY

1200
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
TODAY THAT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY

1201
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
ESSENTIAL TO TALK TO THE YOUNG

1202
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
BOYS AND GIRLS, TO PAINT A

1203
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
PICTURE AND GET A FULL IDEA OF

1204
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
WHAT HAPPENED.

1205
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
THE SCHOOL BEHIND ME IS A CRIME

1206
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
SCENE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE AND

1207
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
IT IS NOT DEALER WHEN THE SCHOOL

1208
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
WILL OPEN UP AGAIN OR EVEN IF IT

1209
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
WILL.
YOU HER THE GOVERNOR SAY THAT

1210
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
FIRST RESPONDERS SAVED LIKES.

1211
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
WE TOLD THROUGH LOCAL POLICE

1212
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
THAT THE SIRENS THAT THE GUNMAN

1213
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
HEARD WHILE HE WAS NEED THE

1214
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
SCHOOL FORCED HIM TO PULL THE

1215
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
TRIGGER ON HIMSELF EARLIER THAN

1216
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
HE EXPECTED LEAVING HUNDREDS OF

1217
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION UNUSED IN

1218
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
THAT SCHOOL BUILDING.

1219
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS

1220
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
THE LAST FEW DAYS AND ONE IS

1221
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
MENTAL HEALTH AND THE SHE BACK

1222
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
IN THE SPOT LIGHT NOT JUST THOSE

1223
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
OF SHOOTER BUT THOSE FACING THE

1224
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS' FAMILY

1225
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
THIS IS NO DOUBT THAT THOSE WHO

1226
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
FRIENDS AND LOVERED ONES DIED

1227
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
HAVE A LONG ROAD AHEAD.

1228
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
IT IS CRITICAL TO HELP THEM TO

1229
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
PREVENT MORE SERIOUS EMOTIONAL

1230
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
ISSUES IN THE FUTURE.

1231
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

1235
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
ONE THING YOU TOLD OUR PRODUCERS

1236
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS AS

1237
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
IMPORTANT AS WHAT WE DO KNOW.

1238
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO ABOUT

1239
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW?

1240
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
>>Guest: IT IS REALLY

1241
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
IMPORTANT WE DON'T LABEL THE

1242
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
SHOOTER UNTIL WE KNOW A LOT MORE

1243
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
OF THE FACTS.

1244
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE LABEL TOO

1245
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
USUALLY IS THERE ARE YOUNG

1246
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
PEOPLE ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY AND

1247
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
ELSEWHERE WATCHING THE NEWS AND

1248
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
PANICKING THAT THEY ARE GOING TO

1249
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
BE LABELED AS BEING ON THE

1250
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
AUTISM SPECTRUM AND, THEREFORE,

1251
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
BEING VIOLENT OR HAVING A MENTAL

1252
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
ILLNESS AND, THEREFORE, BEING

1253
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
VIOLENT.
WE HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL

1254
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
ABOUT CREATING WIDE-SPREAD PANIC

1255
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
AND, ALSO, EXPOSING YOUNG PEOPLE

1256
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
TO POSSIBLE BLAME AND LABELING.

1257
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
OUR FOCUS NEEDS, INSTEAD, TO BE

1258
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
ON HEALING.

1259
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
WE NEED TO PREVENT THIS FROM

1260
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
HAPPENING AGAIN AND PREVENTING

1261
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF

1262
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
THE TRAUMA.

1263
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
>> I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT, THE

1264
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
OTHER POINT YOU MADE IS, HELP

1265
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
THE SURVIVORS NOW.

1266
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
IT SEEMS LIKE LOGIC.

1267
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
WHY STRESS THAT POINT?

1268
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
>> TRAUMA, LEFT TO ITS OWN

1269
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
DEVICES, RESULTS IN MANY

1270
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
HORRIBLE THINS LIKE ADDICTION,

1271
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
DEPRESSION, SUICIDE,

1272
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS F WE WORK

1273
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
WITH THE FAMILIES AND THE

1274
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
COMMUNITY TO BAND TOGETHER WE

1275
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT

1276
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
THOSE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES

1277
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
THAT DECIMATE THE COMMUNITY EVER

1278
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
FURTHER.

1279
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
>> DOCTOR, THANK YOU, FROM

1280
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
CALIFORNIA.

1281
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,000
ASPIRIN, REALLY?

1282
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT ASPIRIN
FOR YEARS.

1283
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
ASPIRIN WOULDN'T REALLY HELP
MY HEADACHE, I DON'T THINK.

1284
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
ASPIRIN IS JUST OLD SCHOOL.

1285
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
PEOPLE HAVE DOUBTS
ABOUT TAKING ASPIRIN FOR PAIN.

1286
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
BUT THEY HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED

1287
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
EXTRA STRENGTH
Bayer Advanced Aspirin.

1288
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
IN FACT, IN A RECENT SURVEY,

1289
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
95% OF PEOPLE
WHO TRIED IT AGREED

1290
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
