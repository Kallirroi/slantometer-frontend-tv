187
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
FRONT OF THEM.

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE A

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
DIFFICULT TIME UNDERSTANDING IS

190
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
WHY THEY NEED TO BE INTERVIEWED

191
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
AT THAT AGE.

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
AUTHORITIES THINK THAT THEY DO.

193
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN

194
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
TOO FAR TOO MANY OF THESE IN HIS

195
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
FOUR YEARS IN OFFICE.

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I THINK HE DID A GOOD JOB.

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
FOR THAT TOWN I CAN'T IMAGE.

198
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
IT IS UNIMAGINABLE BEING A

199
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
FATHERMENT YOUR GREATEST NICE

200
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
MARE IS TO HAVE POLICE KNOCK ON

201
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
YOUR DOOR AND SAY YOUR KID

202
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
SCRATCHED HIS CAR OR SOMETHING

203
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
LIKE THAT, 20 KIDS.

204
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
>> AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH

205
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
WORSE.

206
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
AS BILL WAS SAYING, KIMBERLY,

207
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WANTED TO

208
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
POINT OUT WAS THE HEROISM.

209
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE SOUND

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
BITE YOU CHOOSE.

211
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
>> TOLD ME GOOD MORNING AND

212
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

213
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I SAID I WAS DOING WELL.

214
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
SHE SAID SHE LOVED ME I GAVE HER

215
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
A KISS AND I WAS OUT THE DOOR.

216
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
MY DAUGHTER EMILY WOULD BE ONE

217
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE STANDING

218
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
AND GIVING HER LOVE AND SUPPORT

219
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
TO ALL OF THOSE VICTIMS, BECAUSE

220
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
THAT'S THE TYPE OF PERSON SHE

221
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
IS.
>> KIMBERLY, I CAN IMAGE HOW

222
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
HARD IT WAS AS A PARENT OF A

223
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
6-YEAR-OLD.

224
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
TELL US YOUR THOUGHTS.

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
>> TAKING MY LITTLE BOY TO

226
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
SCHOOL EVERY DAY, HE'S SO YOUNG

227
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I STILL CALL HIM MY BABY BECAUSE

228
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
CHILDREN ARE SO INNOCENT THEY

229
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
RELY ON YOU LOOK UP TO YOU TO

230
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
KEEP THEM SAFE.

231
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
WHEN YOU DROP THEM OFF EVERY

232
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
DAY, BEING A PROSECUTOR AND

233
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
FORMER TEACHER MYSELF OF

234
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN AND

235
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
FIRST GRADE I LOOK AT HIS FACE

236
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
IT'S THE LAST TIME I AM GOING TO

237
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
SEE IT.

238
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I PRESSURE HIM SO MUCH.

239
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I MEMORIZE THE CLOTHES HE HAS ON

240
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
HIS LITTLE SHIRT HIS JACKET HIS

241
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
SHOES, HIS BACKPACK.

242
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I WANT TO HOLD THAT MOMENT SO I

243
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
DON'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED.

244
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
IMAGE THE PARENTS WHO DID THAT

245
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
ON THAT MORNING NOT KNOWING THE

246
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY THAT WOULD

247
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
HAPPEN AT THE END OF THE DAY

248
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
THAT'S THE LAST MOMENT THEY HAD

249
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

250
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
TO PICK THEM UP ON A FRIDAY AT A

251
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
TIME RIGHT BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS

252
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
IT'S UNBEARABLE.

253
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
>> JOINING US NOW TODAY WE HAVE

254
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
BRIAN KILMEADE WHICH IS GOOD.

255
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
THIS MORNING SOME OF THE STORIES

256
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
WE TOLD HERE OBVIOUSLY THE HEART

257
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
WRENCHING ONE FROM KIMBERLY YOU

258
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
TALKED A LOT ABOUT THOSE THIS

259
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
MORNING ON FOX AND FRIENDS.

260
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
WHAT STUCK OUT FOR YOU?

261
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
HOW DO YOU DECIDE TO TELL THE

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
STORY?

263
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
>> YOUR STORIES ARE JUST AS

264
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
IMPORTANT BUT WHAT STOOD OUT FOR

265
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
ME IS WHAT THE TEACHERS DID AND

266
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
THE PRINCIPAL DID.

267
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I UNDERSTAND NAVY SEALS ARE

268
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
TRAINED TO ACT LIKE THIS.

269
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I STILL AM IN AWE HOW THEY ACT

270
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
UNDER PRESSURE AND PUT THEIR

271
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
WELFARE ASIDE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

272
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
WHEN YOU HAVE A 27-YEAR-OLD

273
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
TEACHER WHO HAS NEVER BEEN SHOT

274
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
AT BEFORE YOU IMAGE SEEING A

275
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
BUNCH OF FIRST GRADERS HIDING IN

276
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
THE CLOSET.

277
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
A CLASS HAS BEEN WIPED OUT

278
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
ACROSS THE HALL.

279
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
THAT GUNMAN COMES INTO HER

280
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
CLASSROOM AND SHE HAS HER KIDS

281
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
HIDING IN THE CLOSET SHE TELLS

282
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
THE GUNMAN GO DOWN TO THE HALL.

283
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
WHERE ARE THE KIDS?

284
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
THE KIDS ARE DOWN IN THE

285
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
AUDITORIUM.
ALL OF A SUDDEN SIX KIDS PANIC

286
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
AND THEY RUN OUT OF THE CLOSET

287
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
AT WHICH TIME ACCORDING TO

288
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
REPORTS SHE DIVES IN FRONT OF

289
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
THOSE KIDS TAKES THEIR BULLETS.

290
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
THE KIDS ALSO LOSE THEIR LIVES.

291
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
ONE OF THOSE KIDS WAS BURIED

292
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
TODAY.
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM THE

293
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
HEROISM.
WHERE THAT COMES FROM AS A

294
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
TEACHER IS PURE INSTINCT,

295
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
FEARLESSNESS.
THE PRINCIPAL THERE'S A GUNMAN

296
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
IN THE HALL.
THEY DON'T RUN THEY RUN AT THE

297
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
GUNMAN.
>> IT'S AMAZING THE AMOUNT OF

298
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
COURAGE.
>> AWE INSPIRING.

299
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
>> ALSO SPEAKING OF THAT

300
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD I THOUGHT A

301
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
GREAT WAY TO DESCRIBE THE SCENE

302
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
FOR US. IMAGE A 6-YEAR-OLD

303
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
SAYING THIS ABOUT HOW HE WAS

304
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
GOING TO HELP EVERYBODY GET OUT

305
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
OF IT.

306
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
LISTEN.
>> THERE WERE THE SCENES OF THE

307
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
SCHOOL CHILDREN HELPING ONE

308
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
ANOTHER, HOLDING EACH OTHER,

309
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
DUTIFULLY FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS

310
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
IN THE WAY THAT YOUNG CHILDREN

311
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
SOMETIMES DO.

312
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
ONE CHILD EVEN TRYING TO

313
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
ENCOURAGE A GROWN-UP BY SAYING,

314
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I KNOW KARATE SO IT'S OKAY.

315
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I WILL LEAD THE WAY OUT.

316
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
>> I LOVE THAT STORY.

317
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I THOUGHT ABOUT, ERIC, HOW WE

318
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
ALL HAD -- IF YOU HAVE A CHILD

319
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
IN YOUR LIFE OR YOU ARE FAMILIAR

320
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
WITH A 6-YEAR-OLD'S THINKING,

321
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
YOU TAKE WHAT BRIAN SAID ABOUT

322
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
COURAGE AND SOMETHING ABOUT THE

323
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
INNOCENCE OF A 6-YEAR-OLD, WHAT

324
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
DO YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THAT?

325
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
>> BRIAN SAID SOMETHING VERY

326
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
IMPORTANT.

327
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
TEACHERS AREN'T TRAINED MOST OF

328
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
THEM AREN'T TRAINED TO DO THIS.

329
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
THEY ARE NOT TRAINED TO RUN

330
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
TOWARDS THE FIRE, TOWARDS THE

331
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
BAD GUYS.

332
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
THESE TEACHERS DID.

333
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
IT STRIKES ME A LOT OF TIMES

334
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
SOME OF US ARE HARD ON TEACHERS

335
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
WE ARE TOUGH ON THEM FOR A LOT

336
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
OF REASONS.

337
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
THIS IS JUST AN AWAKENING TO A

338
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
GUY LIKE ME WHO SAYS THESE

339
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
TEACHERS ARE DOING GOD'S WORK.

340
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
THEY ARE PROTECTING OUR MOST

341
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
VALUABLE PRIZED ASSETS AND DOING

342
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
THINGS LIKE THAT.

343
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I HAVE TO THINK MOST EVERY

344
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
TEACHER IN THAT SITUATION WOULD

345
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
PROBABLY DO THE SAME THING.

346
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
>> I WANT TO GET THAT YOOUGHTS

347
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
BOB AND BRIAN.

348
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
WHAT DID YOUR KIDS ASK ABOUT

349
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
THIS WEEKEND.

350
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
THEY ARE OLDER.

351
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
>> THEY ARE OLDER.

352
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
THEY HAD A HARD TIME.

353
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
THEY SAID PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME

354
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
HOW THIS HAPPENED.

355
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE.

356
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
THEY TALK ABOUT FATE AND HOW DID

357
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
GOD LET THIS HAPPEN.

358
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I THINK THEY WERE JUST STUNNED.

359
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
THIS IS WHAT KIMBERLY SAID.

360
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
IMMEDIATELY TOOK OUT MY PHOTO

361
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
ALBUM.

362
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
SAW MY KIDS WHEN THEY WERE THIS

363
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
AGE.
I JUST -- IT IS SO UNIMAGINABLE.

364
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
BY THE WAY ERIC I GIVE YOU

365
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
CREDIT WE DO GET A PROPENSITY TO

366
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
GET DOWN.
THEY SHOWED ENORMOUS COURAGE.

367
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I UNDERSTAND A PARENT THROWING

368
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF BULLETS.

369
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000

00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
FRIENDS HAD A HEART AND A TARGET

553
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
MADE IT SIMILAR TO 9-11.

554
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
WE KNOW WE ARE NOT TERROR PROOF

555
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
BUT WE TRY TO MAKE OURSELVES

556
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
TERROR PROOF AS BEST WE CAN.

557
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU DO

558
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
THAT IN THE SCHOOL WITHOUT

559
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
BLOWING THE BUDGET.

560
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I AM WONDERING BO DEEDLE BROUGHT

561
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
UP IN THE SHOW THERE'S SO MANY

562
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
RETIRED COPS AT 40.

563
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
IF YOU COULD PUT A PLAIN CLOTHED

564
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
PERSON WHO IS TRAINED WITH A

565
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
WEAPON SHOULD A PSYCHO PATH LIKE

566
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
THIS GET LOSE YOU COULD GO TO

567
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
WORK AND DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

568
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
KNOWING YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU

569
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
CAN TO KEEP YOUR CHILD SAFE.

570
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
IF THEY WOULD BE TRAINED TO DO

571
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
IT UNALARMING AND IN THE PRIME

572
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
OF THEIR LIFE IN THEIR 40s THEY

573
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
ARE ALMOST GIVING BACK TO THEIR

574
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
COMMUNITY WITHOUT BLOWING THE

575
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
BUDGET I BELIEVE THAT WOULD GO A

576
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
LONG WAY.

577
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
>> I GREW UP IN CONNECTICUT.

578
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I HAVE BEEN IN NEWTOWN MANY

579
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
TIMES.
IT IS THE ONE TOWN OF ALL OF THE

580
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
TOWNS IN CONNECTICUT I NEVER

581
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IT TO

582
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
HAPPEN.

583
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
THEY CALL IT THE SAFEST TOWN IN

584
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
AMERICA I THINK 6TH OR 7TH

585
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
STATE.

586
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
IT DOES TAKE THE INNOCENCE AWAY

587
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
FROM ALL OF IT.

588
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
THIS WAS NOT A CITY WITH URBAN

589
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
PROBLEMS OR THE REST OF IT.

590
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
THIS IS AN IDEALIC LITTLE TOWN.

591
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
IMAGE IT'S NOT THAT BIG A TOWN.

592
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
JUST IMAGE CHRISTMAS.

593
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
IT IS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.

594
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
>> -- SURVIVOR'S GUILT IS HUGE.

595
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
>> WE ARE UP AGAINST A BREAK

596
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
HERE.

597
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT OTHER

598
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
FACETS OF THE STORY.

599
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
ONE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO

600
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
NOTE.
WE PROTECT -- THINK ABOUT EVERY

601
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
SIPPING EL BANK YOU HAVE EVER

602
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
BEEN TO.

603
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
TELL ME ONE TIME YOU SEE A BANK

604
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
WHERE IT IS NOT GUARDED WITH

605
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
SOMEONE WITH OR WITHOUT A GUN

606
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE

607
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
DOING.
YOU SHOW ME A BANK WITHOUT A

608
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
GUARD I WILL SHOW YOU THE BANK

609
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
THAT IS NOT GOING TO GET R-- I

610
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
SHOW YOU THE BANK THAT WILL GET

611
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
ROBBED.
PUT SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO

612
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
HANDLE HIMSELF AND A WEAPON AT

613
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
THE DOOR OF ANY SCHOOL IN

614
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
AMERICA.
IF WE CAN DO IT FOR BANKS WE CAN

615
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
DO IT AT A SCHOOL.

616
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I WISH EVERY 20 ONE OF THESE

617
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
PARENTS WOULD GIVE A DIME FOR

618
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
THIS.

619
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
>> AS SOON AS HE SAW A COP, IF

620
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
WE GOT THERE EARLY ERROR SOONER.

621
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
>> GOT THERE 10 MINUTES BEFORE

622
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
THEY LOCKED THE SCHOOL DOWN,

623
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
TOO.

624
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
>> IF THEY HAVE SECURITY IN
THERE IT IS GOING TO SAVE LIVES.

625
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
>> WE HAVE TO GO.

626
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
WE MAY NEVER KNOW, I AM NOT

627
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
GOING TO USE HIS NAME.

628
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
THE SHOOTER WHY HE DID THIS

629
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
UNSPEAKABLE CRIME.

630
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS

631
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
OUT.
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER WHO WAS ONCE

632
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
A PSYCHOLOGIST HAS SOME

633
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
THOUGHTS.

634
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
...so as you can see, GEICO's
customer satisfaction is at 97%.

635
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Mmmm tasty.

636
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And cut! Very good.

637
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

638
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

639
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

640
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It's not real.

641
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

642
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

643
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

644
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

645
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
>> WELCOME BACK.

646
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
POLICE HAVE NOT YET RELEASED

647
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
DETAILS ABOUT THE MOTIVE OR

648
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
MENTAL STATE OF THE GUNMAN ADAM

649
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
LANZA.
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW EXACTLY

650
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY.

651
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER HAS THOUGHTS

652
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
ON WHAT THE FOCUS SHOULD BE.

653
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
>> YOU HAVE THE PSYCHOLOGIST THE

654
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
SHOOTER YOU HAVE A WEAPON AND

655
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT.

656
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I TEND TO GRAVITATE TOWARD THE

657
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
PSYCHOLOGY OF THE KILLER.

658
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE DETAILS

659
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
OF THE CRIME HE BEGAN BY

660
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
SHOOTING HIS MOTHER IN THE FACE.

661
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
THAT I THINK IS WHERE I WOULD

662
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
START.

663
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
ALTHOUGH I THINK ALL OF THE

664
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
ISSUES HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED.

665
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
>> WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE

666
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
DETAILS AND TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF

667
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN SOME KIND OF

668
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
DESPERATE HOPE FROM TRYING TO

669
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
STOP IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

670
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
IT'S A NECESSARY PROCESS TO GO

671
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
THROUGH TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHY

672
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
THIS HAPPENED, WHAT WENT WRONG.

673
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES THE

674
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
MOTHER WAS VERY DEVOTED REALLY

675
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
TRYING TO ATTEND TO HER SON TO

676
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
FOCUS ON DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS AND

677
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
CHALLENGES EVEN BROUGHT HIM OUT

678
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
HOME SCHOOLED TO PUT HIM IN A

679
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
MORE COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT

680
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
BECAUSE HE FACED SOCIAL

681
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
CHALLENGES.

682
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
WHAT HAPPENED.
EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW.

683
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
>> I GRAVITATE TO WANT WILL

684
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
{SUFFIXÑ]LING TO KNOW THAT, TOO.

685
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
THE POLICY QUESTION ABOUT GUNS

686
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
AND MAYBE EVEN MENTAL HEALTH I

687
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
THINK WILL BE A PART OF WHATEVER

688
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA DECIDES TO GO

689
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
FORWARD WITH.

690
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
THE THING THE ARTICLE THAT WENT

691
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
AROUND RETWEETED A NUMBER OF

692
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
TIMES.
SHE WAS A MOTHER SHE SAID I AM

693
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
ADAM LANZA'S MOTHER.

694
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
SHE DESCRIBED IN HEARTBREAKING

695
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
DETAIL WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO HAVE

696
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
A CHILD JUST WHAT SHE SAID BASED

697
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
ON DESCRIPTION SEEMED MAYBE

698
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS

699
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
THIS OTHER CHILD -- NOT CHILD

700
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
BUT THE KILLER I SHOULD SAY CH

701
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
HE WAS A SON AND THERE WAS A

702
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
DEVOTED MOTHER.

703
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
YOU THINK THERE MIGHT BE A LOT

704
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
OF PARENTS WHO ARE THINKING WHAT

705
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
CAN I DO?

706
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

707
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
DID HE HAVE EVERYTHING HE

708
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
NEEDED.

709
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
OBVIOUSLY NOT OR MAYBE THERE IS

710
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
JUST NO SIM TELL ANSWER TO THIS

711
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
QUESTION.
CHARLES IS SOMEBODY THAT I WOULD

712
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
TURN TO TO SAY HELP ME

713
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND

714
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
THIS.
>> ERIC?

715
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
>> THAT PEAIECE IS AMAZING.

716
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
A MOM ON A BLOG SPOT I PULLED IT

717
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
UP IT HAD A THOUSANDS COMMENTS.

718
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
HERE'S THE THING.
THERE ARE SO MANY THEORIES

719
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BLAME GUNS

720
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
AND MENTAL HEALTH AND VIDEO

721
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
GAMES AND RELIGION, BREAKDOWN IN

722
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
FAMILY.

723
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
WE NEED TO POINT SOMETHING OUT.

724
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
THERE WAS SO MUCH MISINFORMATION

725
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
THAT WAS PUT OUT THERE THERE WAS

726
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
A SECOND SHOOTER, THE SHOOTER

727
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
KILLED HIS FATHER FIRST.

728
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
THAT THE MOTHER WAS IN AT THE

729
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
SCHOOL.

730
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
WE NEED TO TAKE A BREATH LET THE

731
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
POLICE TO THEIR WORK PUT OUT THE

732
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
DETAILS WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS

733
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
MENTAL ISSUES THEN WE CAN START

734
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
TO ASSIST.

742

OBVIOUS PROBLEMS.

744
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000

OR ANOTHER.

750
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000

SANE PERSON WOULD NOT DO THIS.

752
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000

754
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000

757
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
THAT IS A LEGITIMATE QUESTION

758
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000

COUNSELING?
>> OR IN A SPECIAL HOME.

763
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000

MENTALLY ILL.

782
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000

784
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
LOOK AT GUNS BUT THAT'S NOT IT.

921
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
>> FIRST OF ALL AN ASSAULT

922
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
WEAPON.

923
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
FROM THE EARLY MORNING WE HAD A

924
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
MEETING I SAID I DON'T WANT TO

925
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
DO THIS GUN CONTROL DISCUSSION

926
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A DAY PLACE

927
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
AND A TIME FOR ALL THAT.

928
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
WE CAN'T DO IT.

929
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
LET'S NOT BE LIKE BLOOMBERG,

930
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
BILL MAHER BOB BECKEL AND JUMP

931
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
OUT WHILE WE ARE BURYING OUR

932
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
KIDS AS WE SPEAK.

933
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT GUNS.

934
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

935
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
WE ARE USING DEATHS OF CHILDREN

936
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
TO PUSH OUR POLITICAL AGENDA.

937
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
YOU ARE MY GOOD FRIEND BUT YOU

938
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
ARE ABSOLUTELY WRONG.

939
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
>> YOU ARE WRONG TO SAY WE CAN'T

940
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
TALK ABOUT THIS NOW.

941
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
>> I REFUSE TO HAVE THIS

942
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
CONVERSATION.

943
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
>> WHEN WILL THAT TIME AND PLACE

944
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
BE?

945
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
>> WHEN OUR CHILDREN ARE BURIED,

946
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
BOB.
>> HOW ABOUT THIS.

947
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
BILL BENNETT FEELS DIFFERENT

948
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
LANED CONGRESSMAN GOER FEELS

949
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
DIFFERENTLY.

950
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
IF THAT PRINCIPAL HAD A GUN

951
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
INSTEAD OF LUNGING WITH JUST HER

952
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
BODY SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE

953
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
OUT THAT GUNMAN.

954
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
HERE'S WHAT BILL BENNETT

955
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
SUGGESTED EARLIER YESTERDAY.

956
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
>> I AM SURE I WILL GET MAIL FOR

957
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
THIS.
I AM NOT SO SURE I WOULDN'T WANT

958
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
ONE PERSON IN A SCHOOL ARMED,

959
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
READY FOR THIS KIND OF THING.

960
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
THE PRINCIPAL LUNGED AT THIS

961
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
GUY.

962
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST LUNGED

963
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
AT THE GUY.

964
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
HAS TO BE SOMEONE WHO IS TRAINED

965
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
HAS TO BE SOMEONE RESPONSIBLE.

966
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
BUT MY GOD IF YOU CAN PREVENT

967
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
THIS KIND OF THING,IC Y I THINK

968
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
OUGHT TO.
>> SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT THIS

969
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
NOW?
>> WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

970
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
IT.
IT WAS INTERESTING I WAS

971
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
THINKING BACK, NOT ONE OF THE

972
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
OBAMA ROMNEY DEBATES THIS

973
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
QUESTION DIDN'T COME UP AT ALL.

974
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
THAT'S WHY I FEEL A LITTLE BIT

975
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
OH NOW YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

976
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
IT.

977
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA TALKED ABOUT --

978
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
HE MENTIONED FORT HOOD I

979
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
WOULDN'T PUT IT IN THE SAME

980
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
CATEGORY ON THAT ONE.

981
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
WHY COULDN'T BOTH THINGS BE

982
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
TRUE.
WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT ARMING

983
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
THE SCHOOLS AND THEN IF SOMEONE

984
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
CAN PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT BAN ON

985
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS WOULD HELP

986
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
PREVENT THIS.

987
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I WOULD BE OPEN MINDED UNLESS I

988
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
CAN THINK ABOUT THAT IN ADDITION

989
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
TO THE MENTAL HEALTH THINGS WE

990
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ON THIS

991
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
SHOW IN PARTICULAR FOR THE PAST

992
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
COUPLE OF MONTHS.

993
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
>> LOOK, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

994
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
DISCUSSION.

995
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I GO OUT TO THE FAMILY ON THIS

996
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
ON TERMS OF WHEN IS THE RIGHT

997
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
TIME TO DISCUSS THIS.
THE FUNERALS AND HONORING THE

998
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
LIVES OF THE VICTIMS IS

999
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
PARAMOUNT AND THEN HAVE

1000
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
DISCUSSION WITH COURAGE AND

1001
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
CLARITY BUT I BELIEVE WE NEED TO

1002
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
HAVE IT.

1003
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
>> LOOK AT GUNS LOOK AT

1004
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
PROTECTING THE CLASSROOMS ALL

1005
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
PART OF ONE COMMISSION GIVEN A

1006
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
DEADLINE TO REDUCE THE ASSAULT.

1007
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
>> I AM NOT SURE THE FAMILIES

1008
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
WOULD WANT TO HAVE THE

1009
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
DISCUSSION ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE.

1010
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
SOMEONE GIVE ME ONCE TO HAVE AN

1011
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
ASSAULT WEAPON IN THIS COUNTRY.

1012
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
>> OKAY.
THERE'S A FANTASY LAND OF SAYING

1013
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
WAE A MAGIC WAND IT WILL NEVER

1014
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
HAPPEN AGAIN.

1015
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I THINK THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE

1016
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
IN THE SCHOOL TO MAKE SURE

1017
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
THERE'S A DETERRENT.

1018
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
THE COLORADO SHOOTER WENT TO

1019
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
THREE MOVIE THEATERS BEFORE HE

1020
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
WENT TO THAT ONE BECAUSE HE WAS

1021
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
DETERRED, THERE WAS CONCEALED

1022
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
CARRY WAS AVAILABLE AT THE OTHER

1023
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
PLACE.

1024
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
THAT WAS WHY.

1025
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
THERE'S A DETERRENT FACTOR WHILE

1026
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
WE TRANSITION INTO THE FANTASY

1027
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
LAND OF THERE BEING NO GUNS.

1028
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
>> I THINK IT WILL BE LOOKED AT.

1029
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
IT WILL BE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK

1030
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
AND HOPEFULLY NO POLITICS

1031
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
INVOLVED IN IT.

1032
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000

HOUR.

1034
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS AWFUL

1035
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
HAPPENS WHAT SHOULD SAY TO YOUR

HE SAID TO ME I DON'T HAVE

1084
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I HAVE LOST MY BEST FRIEND.

1085

I SAID TO HIM THAT GOD IS GOING

00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
TO SEND YOU SOME WONDERFUL NEW

1087
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000

YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR SISTER

YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY BECAUSE

1091
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000

ABOUT WHAT HEAVEN WAS LIKE.

1094

TO BE HAPPY, THAT SHE WAS GOING

1096
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
TO BE SAFE, BUT IT WAS SHORTLY

1097
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000

FAMILIES.
FOR YEARS I DIDN'T DEAL WITH IT

1131
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
A LIFELONG PROCESS.

1132
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000

I HAD A DISCUSSION WITH MY SON

1136
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
THREE OR FOUR TIMES HE PUSHED

1137
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000

1138
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000

THEY HAVE FEELINGS ABOUT IT THEY

1143
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
NEED TO EXPRESS IT.

1144
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
THEY PUSH BACK A LOT BECAUSE

1145
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
THAT'S WHAT TEENS DO.

1146
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000

1151
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
UNDERSTAND.
