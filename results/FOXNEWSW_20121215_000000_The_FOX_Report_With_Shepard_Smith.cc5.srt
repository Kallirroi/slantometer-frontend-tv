137
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
IT JUST DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT'S

138
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
EVEN POSSIBLE.

139
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
>> THERE IS NO WORDS.

140
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
IT'S SHEAR TERROR AND A SENSE OF

141
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
IMMEDIATE URGENCY AND TO GET TO

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
PROTECT THEM.

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
WHO SURVIVED THIS SLAUGHTER,

147
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
WERE TOLD BY COPS AND TEACHERS

148
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
TO COVER THEIR EYES.

149
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE THEY WERE

150
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
TOLD THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE

151
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
LITERALLY STEPPING AROUND AND

152
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
OVER THE BODIES OF THEIR

CONFUSION THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000

VIEWERS TO BE PARENT AS WE WORK

159
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
THROUGH IT.
THERE IS A LOT OF CONFUSION

160
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
ABOUT THE SHOOTER.  WHAT CAN WE

161
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000

LANZA.

165
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
THERE WAS CONFUSION EARLIER
BECAUSE HE MAY HAVE BEEN

166
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
LANZA'S I.D., HIS ELDER BROTHER

168
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
IS 24.
HE'S IN CUSTODY.

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
HE'S HELPING THE F.B.I. WITH

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
THEIR QUESTIONS, APPARENTLY

171
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
BEING VERY COOPERATIVE.

172
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
NOT A SUSPECT IN ANY WAY.

173
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
BUT THE SHOOTER, WE'RE TOLD,

174
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
IDENTIFYING IT, THE ONLY WAY

188
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
BECAUSE THESE KIDS OBVIOUSLY

189
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
DON'T CARRY I.D., IS FOR THE

190
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
PARENTS TO ACTUALLY IDENTIFY THE

191
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
BODIES THEMSELVES.

192
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
GOVERNOR MALLOY TALKED ABOUT

193
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
THAT DIFFICULT PROCESS EARLIER

194
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
TODAY.

195
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
LISTEN.
>> OUR POLICE PERSONNEL AND

196
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
OTHERS ARE DOING THE UTMOST TO

197
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
CLEAR THIS SITUATION AS SOON AS

198
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
POSSIBLE TO RETURN THESE

199
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS OR

200
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
THESE LOVED ONES TO THEIR FELLOW

201
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
LOVED ONES AS QUICKLY AS

202
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
POSSIBLE.

203
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
AND WE'LL WORK WITH ALL OF THE

204
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
RESIDENTS OF THIS COMMUNITY AND

205
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
CONNECTICUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

206
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
DO, IN FACT, GET THROUGH THIS.

207
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
>> JUST IMAGINE, BILL, THAT MANY

208
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
OF THESE PARENTS HAVE PROBABLY

209
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
ALREADY BOUGHT AND WRAPPED

210
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
CHRISTMAS PRESENTS, PUT THEM

211
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
UNDER THE TREE.

212
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
THEY'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO GIVE

213
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THEM TO THEIR KIDS.

214
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
>> TEN OR 11 DAYS FROM NOW.

215
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT INSIDE

216
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THAT SCHOOL IT'S A GRISLY SCENE

217
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
AND IT'S NOT SIMPLISTIC, MEANING

218
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
THAT THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE

219
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
THESE INVESTIGATORS HAVE TO GO

220
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THROUGH.

221
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
THE MIND REELS WHEN YOU THINK

222
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
ABOUT IT.
IF YOU'RE A POLICE OFFICER

223
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
ARRIVING INSIDE THAT CLASSROOM

224
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
ST HAVE SEEN.

225
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
THERE ARE ACCOUNTS APPARENTLY

226
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
THAT AM SO OF THE FIRST

227
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
RESPONDERS ARE PRETTY BROKEN UP.

228
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
>> POLICE OFFICERS AND

229
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
FIREFIGHTERS.
THERE WAS A FIRE HOUSE VERY NEAR

230
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND

231
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
SOME OF THOSE FIREFIGHTERS WERE

232
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
AMONG THE FIRST TO GET THERE.

233
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
WE HEARD REPORTS, WE DID NOT SEE

234
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
IT WITH OUR OWN EYES -- BUT

235
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
UNDERSTANDABLY WERE LEAVING THE

236
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
SCHOOL IN TEARS.

237
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
THEY HAD GONE IN OBVIOUSLY,

238
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
FOUND 20 CHILDREN AMONG 26 DEAD.

239
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
IT IS OBVIOUSLY THERE WILL BE A

240
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
LOT OF COUNSELING FOR THE

241
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
CHILDREN, FOR THE PARENTS, AND

242
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
AS THE COPS SAID TODAY, FOR THE

243
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
FIRST RESPONDERS.

244
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
LISTEN.

245
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
>> THE FIRST RESPONDERS TO COME

246
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
TOGETHER, COUNSELORS, IT'S

247
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
AMAZING HOW THE IMMENSE AMOUNT

248
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
OF FAMILY THAT'S SHOWN IN FRONT

249
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
OF NEWTOWN.
EVERYONE IS COMING TOGETHER,

250
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
SUPPORTING EVERYONE, WORKING

251
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
TOGETHER, TRYING TO ANSWER ALL

252
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
THE QUESTIONS AS TO HOW AND WHY

253
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
THIS OCCURRED AND TRYING TO LEND

254
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
SUPPORT TO ALL THE PEOPLE

255
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
INVOLVED, INCLUDING THE VICTIMS.

256
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
>> ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE, BILL, I

257
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
THINK ULTIMATELY TO EVEN PUT

258
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
INTO WORDS THE AMOUNT OF PAIN

259
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
BEING FELT IN THIS COMMUNITY.

260
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
>> I'VE BEEN WITH YOU THROUGHOUT

261
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
THE DAY AND TERRIFIC WORK UNDER

262
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND MANY IN

263
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
THE TOWN, YOU REALLY FEEL FOR

264
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH.

265
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
WE SHOULD GET BRIEFING FROM THE

266
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THIS HOUR.

267
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, WE'LL BRING

268
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
IT YOU WANT TO INVESTIGATORS SAY

269
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
THEY FOUND THE SUSPECT'S MOTHER

270
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
DEAD INSIDE HER HOME.

271
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
NOT FAR FROM THE SCHOOL, ABOUT

272
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
TEN MILES.

273
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
THAT'S WHAT FEDERAL LAW

274
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
ENFORCEMENT SOURCES ARE TELLING

275
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
US TONIGHT.

276
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
LOCAL POLICE HAVE NOT YET

277
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
CONFIRMED A LOT OF THIS, BUT

278
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
MOLLY LINE IS WORKING THAT PART

279
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
OF THE STORY.

280
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
SHE IS OUTSIDE THE MOTHER'S HOME

281
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
HERE IN NEARBY NEWTOWN.

282
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT

283
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
HAPPENED INSIDE THAT HOUSE THAT

284
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
WAS OWNED BY NANCY LANZA?

285
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
MOLLY, GOOD EVENING TO YOU.

286
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
>> BILL, MUCH OF THE INFORMATION

287
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
HAS BEEN GATHERED FROM

288
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
AUTHORITIES HERE IN CONNECTICUT

289
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND FROM

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
RICK LEVENTHAL WHO SPENT MUCH OF

291
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000

IN THIS HOUR.

295
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
BUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT

296
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
HAPPENED THIS MORNING IS THAT

297
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
ADAM LANZA GOT UP, SHOT HIS

298
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
MOTHER, NANCY LANZA, IN THE

299
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
FACE, WHO IS A TEACHER AT THE

300
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
SCHOOL WHERE MUCH OF THE

301
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
HORRIFIC ACTIVITIES HAPPENED

302
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
TODAY.

303
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
HE THEN GATHERED HER WEAPONS,

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000

TWO HAND GUN AND A RIFLE, GOT IN

306
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
HER CAR AND DROVE TO THE SCHOOL.

307
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
THOSE ARE THE ACTIVITIES  THAT

308
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
HAPPENED HERE IN THE

309
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WE KNOW ABOUT.

310
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
A HORRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE,

311
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU LOOK DOWN
A STREET, UPPER CLASS HOMES,

312
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
BEAUTIFUL CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS.

313
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
HORRIFIC ACTIVITY, NOTHING WOULD

314
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
HAVE BEEN EXPECTED LIKE THIS.

315
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
>> MOLLY, YOU HAD A CHANCE TO

316
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
SPEAK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE

317
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
SMALL TOWN.

318
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
WHAT ARE THEY TELLING YOU ABOUT

319
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
HOW THEY'RE TRYING TO PROCESS

320
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
AND UNDERSTAND THIS?

321
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
>> YOU KNOW, IT WAS AN EMOTIONAL

322
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
EXPERIENCE ALL ACROSS THE

323
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
COMMUNITY TODAY, PARTICULARLY

324
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
WHEN NOBODY HAD ANY IDEA WHAT

325
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
WAS GOING ON, PARTICULARLY WHEN

326
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
TEXT MESSAGES WERE COMING TO

327
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
PARENTS' PHONES.

328
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
WE SPOKE TO A WOMAN WHO WORKED

329
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
AT A CAFE.
THIS IS A SMALL TOWN WITH

330
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
INDEPENDENTLY OWNED BUSINESSES

331
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
LINING THE STREETS AND SHE SAID

332
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF MOTHERS

333
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
AT THE SCHOOL GETTING THE PHONE

334
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
CALLS AND TEXT MESSAGES,

335
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING, RUNNING

336
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
FROM HER STORE AND HER FEAR IS

337
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
THAT SHE WILL KNOW SOME OF THOSE

338
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
CHILDREN THAT WERE KILLED TODAY.

339
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
WE HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH A

340
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
WOMAN WHO OWNS A HAIR CUTTING

341
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
PLACE FOR KIDS, SPECIFICALLY FOR

342
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
CHILDREN.

343
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
SHE SAYS FOR MANY OF THE

344
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
VICTIMS, SHE SUSPECTS SHE MAY

345
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
HAVE GIVEN THEM THEIR FIRST HAIR

346
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
CUT AND THEIR SECOND HAIR CUT

347
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
AND THIRD HAIR CUT.

348
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
THIS IS A VERY SMALL COMMUNITY

349
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
WITH SMALL BUSINESSES LINING THE

350
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
STREETS.

351
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
REALLY THE TYPE OF PLACE WHERE

352
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYONE ELSE AND

353
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
THERE IS A WAIT AND SEE NOW TO

354
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
FIND OUT WHO AMONG THEM ARE

355
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
AMONG THE VICTIMS.

356
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
BILL.

357
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
>> INDEED THERE IS.
THANK YOU.

358
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
MOLLY LINE, ABOUT TEN MILES FROM

359
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
OUR LOCATION RIGHT NEAR THE

360
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
SCHOOL HERE IN NEWTOWN,

361
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
CONNECTICUT.
THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT.

362
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I MET A YOUNG GIRL EARLIER

363
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
TODAY.
SHE SAID IT'S HER BIRTHDAY

364
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
TODAY.
SHE TURNED 11 YEARS OLD AND SHE

365
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
ASKED HER MOTHER IF THIS WILL BE

366
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
HER OWN 9-11.

367
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
THERE IS SO MUCH CONFUSION, AS

368
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE, AS PEOPLE SORT

369
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
THROUGH THIS.
WE ARE LEARNING, BY THE WAY,

370
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
MORE TONIGHT ABOUT THE FAMILY OF

371
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
FIRST THREE HOURS OF REPORTING

377
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
ON THIS STORY TODAY, WE WERE

378
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
BEING TOLD BY AUTHORITIES A MAN

379
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
IN HIS 20S NAMED RYAN LANZA WAS

380
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
THE SHOOTER AND WAS DEAD.

381
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
TONIGHT, OF COURSE, WE KNOW AND

382
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
HAVE TOLD YOU HIS YOUNGER

383
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
BROTHER, ADAM, IS THE ONE WHO IS

384
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
DEAD, SUSPECTED OF CARRYING OUT

385
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
THE MASSACRE, WEARING HIS OLDER

386
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
BROTHER'S IDENTIFICATION.

387
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT ORIGINAL

388
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
SUSPECT, RYAN LANZA, HAS BEEN IN

389
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
CUSTODY FOR MUCH OF THE DEREK

390
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
BEING QUESTIONED IN HOBOKEN, NEW

391
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
JERSEY.
OFFICIALS BELIEVE RYAN LANZA IS

392
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
COOPERATING AND NOT BELIEVED TO

393
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE

394
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
RAMPAGE.
FOX NEWS HAS CONFIRMED RYAN

395
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
LANZA HAS A FACEBOOK PAGE.

396
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
IT IS ACTIVE.

397
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
WE'RE NOT SHOWING IT HERE.

398
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
BUT IT LISTS HIM FROM NEWTOWN,

399
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
CONNECTICUT, AND LIVING IN

400
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
HOBOKEN.
IT CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION TODAY

401
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
WHEN HE OR SOMEONE ELSE ON HIS

402
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
BEHALF BEGAN LEAVING MESSAGES

403
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
ON-LINE VIA TWITTER ABOUT RYAN

404
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
LANZA NOT BEING THE SHOOTER AND

405
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
SAYING HIS FACEBOOK PAGE SHOWED

406
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
A MAN WHO HAD NOT DONE THE

407
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
HORRIBLE THING IN CONNECTICUT.

408
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
AT THE SAME TIME, A SOURCE

409
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
TELLING ME RYAN WAS PART OF A

410
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
FAMILY THAT LIVED A VERY QUIET

411
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
EXISTENCE.
THE DAD OFTEN VISITED RYAN LANZA

412
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
WHEN HE WAS ENROLLED AT QUINN

413
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
PEE YACK UNIVERSITY AND THE TWO

414
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
APPEARED TO HAVE A GOOD

415
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
RELATIONSHIP.
BUT THAT RYAN TALKED SO LITTLE

416
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
ABOUT HIS FAMILY THAT EVEN THOSE

417
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM FOR YEARS

418
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
KNEW VERY FEW DETAILS ABOUT

419
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
THEM.
NOT ONE PICTURE OF HIS FAMILY

420
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
INSIDE HIS COLLEGE ROOM.

421
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
NO MENTION OF HIS BROTHER, ADAM.

422
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH RYAN'S

423
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
PARENTS WERE DIVORCED, BUT FEW

424
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
PEOPLE WERE SURE ABOUT THAT.

425
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
IN FACT, I CAN SAY THAT THEY ARE

426
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
DIVORCED.

427
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
THE DAD, PETER LANZA, LIVES NOT

428
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
FAR FROM THE SCENE IN

429
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
CONNECTICUT.
WE'RE TOLD HE'S STILL TALKING

430
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
WITH F.B.I. AGENTS, BUT NOT

431
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
SUSPECTED OF HAVING ANY ROLE IN

432
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000

A SHOOTER ENTERED A SCHOOL

473
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
EARLIER TODAY SHOOTING TO DEATH

474
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
20 CHILDREN, SIX ADULTS.

475
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
ALEXIS SAYS SHE WAS IN A

476
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
CLASSROOM WHEN POLICE BURST IN

477
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
AND TOLD EVERYONE TO HIDE IN A

478
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
CORNER.

479
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
NOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH HER

480
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
DAUGHTER AND GOOD EVENING TO

481
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
YOU.
WOW.
WHAT A DAY THIS MUST BE.

482
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
>> UNBELIEVABLE DAY.
SHE'S HOLDING UP AND SHE'S BEEN

483
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
A TROOPER.
WE'RE DOING A LOT OF TALKING AND

484
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
A LOT OF COMMUNICATING AND A LOT

485
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
OF EXTRA HUGS AND KISS.

486
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
>> Bill: HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE

487
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
WITH HER NOW, LYNN?

488
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

489
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
>> WE'RE HONEST WITH HER AND SHE

490
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE PRINCIPAL

491
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
HAD BEEN KILLED AND SO SHE HAD

492
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
HEARD THAT ON THE NEWS.

493
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I SAT DOWN NEXT TO HER AND

494
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
EXPLAINED TO HER WHAT HAD

495
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
HAPPENED AND THE MAN THAT DID

496
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
ALL OF THIS IS NO LONGER HERE.

497
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT FEELINGS

498
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
AND TALKED A LOT ABOUT HOW ARE

499
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
YOU DOING AND IS THERE ANYTHING

500
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
YOU WOULD LIKE OR WHAT DO YOU

501
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
WANT TO TALK ABOUT, OR -- JUST

502
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
IN GENERAL, JUST HOW ARE YOU AS

503
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
A PERSON?
SHE'S EIGHT.

504
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
SHE'S NOT TWO.

505
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
SO THERE IS, UNFORTUNATELY, YOU

506
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
CAN'T HIDE THINGS FROM CHILDREN

507
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
AT THIS AGE.

508
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
SO WE'RE JUST IN CONSTANT

509
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
COMMUNICATION WITH HER TO KIND

510
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
OF CHECK IN AND SAY, ARE YOU

511
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
DOING OKAY?

512
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
OR WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

513
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
ARE YOU SAD?

514
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
HER AND I JOURNAL BACK AND FORTH

515
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
VERY OFTEN.

516
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THIS.

517
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT TOOL FOR

518
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
THE TWO OF US AND WE'LL WRITE

519
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAPPENED
DURING THE DAY OR IF WE'RE

520
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
FEELING HAPPY OR SAD OR

521
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
SOMETHING IS BOTHERING US.

522
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
SO THIS WILL BE A PHENOMENAL

523
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
TOOL THAT WE WILL HAVE GOING

524
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
FORWARD.

525
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
BUT SHE'S BEEN OPEN AND HONEST

526
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
AND SHE IS SAD AND SO SHE'S JUST

527
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
LIKE MAMA, ARE YOU OKAY?

528
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000

575
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
>> I HAVEN'T THE WORDS THAT

576
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
MAKES THE PAIN OF WHAT HAPPENED

577
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
TODAY EASY TO BEAR.

578
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'M HEART BROKEN AS I KNOW ALL

579
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
OF YOU ARE.

580
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
BUT NOTHING HURTS MORE THAN THE

581
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
LOSS OF INNOCENCE, BUT NO MORE

582
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
SO WITH THOSE THAT ARE LEFT.

I HAVE A SIMPLE PRAYER, I TURN

586
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000

587
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
MY PRAYER IS VERY SIMPLE.

588
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
SHOW ME AND SHOW US THE WAY TO

589
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND THOSE

590
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SO

591
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000

593
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
BURKS WE NEED TO DO IT TOGETHER

599
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000

LOVING SUPPORT AROUND THOSE

601
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST A CHILD.

602
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE.

603
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I KNEW THAT WE WOULD.

604
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
>> Bill: THIS IS ONLY THE

605
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
BEGINNING.
ONLY THE BEGINNING FOR A VERY

606
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
LONG HEALING PROCESS, ONLY TEN

607
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
HOURS INTO THIS HORRIFIC STORY

608
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
HERE IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

609
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I MENTIONED ST. JOHN EPISCOPAL

610
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
CHURCH,  WHICH IS DOWN THE ROAD

611
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
FROM HERE.

612
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
IT IS OPEN.
THE DOORS ARE OPEN OF THE THE

613
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
LIGHTS ARE ON AND THE SIGN

614
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
OUTSIDE SAYS HEALING PRAYER

615
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000

616
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
AS I MENTIONED, THE HEALING IS

617
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
JUST UNDERWAY.

618
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA FIGHTING BACK

TEARS, SPEAKING TO THE NATION

620
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT THE

SCHOOL SHOOTING.

622
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
A GUNMAN KILLING 26 PEOPLE,

623
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
INCLUDING 20 YOUNG CHILDREN.

624
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
THE PRESIDENT SAYING HE REACTED

625
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
TO THIS NEWS NOT AS A PRESIDENT,

626
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
BUT AS A PARENT.

627
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
>> THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO

628
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
DIED TODAY WERE CHILDREN.

629
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN

THE AGES OF FIVE AND TEN YEARS

631
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
OLD.

632
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

633
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
AHEAD OF THEM, BIRTHDAYS,

634
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
GRADUATIONS, WEDDINGS, KIDS OF

635
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
THEIR OWN.

636
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
>> Bill: THERE IS A LOT OF THAT

637
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
EMOTION THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY

638
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
TONIGHT.
THE PRESIDENT ORDERING FLAGS AT

639
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000

FLY AT HALF-STAFF FOR THE NEXT

642
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
FEW DAYS.

643
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER

644
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
TWEETING EARLIER HE'S DOING THE

645
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
SAME WITH THE CAPITOL IN TRIBUTE

646
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
TO THE VICTIMS AND THEIR

647
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
FAMILIES.
HE ADDED THE HASH TAG, PRAY FOR

648
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
NEWTOWN.
ED HENRY JOINS US LIVE AT THE

649
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT.

650
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
THE PRESIDENT MADE IT CLEAR, THE

651
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STANDS BY

652
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
THIS TOWN IN CONNECTICUT.

653
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
>> NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

654
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
GOOD EVENING, BILL.

655
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

656
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
YOU SOUGHT THE RAW EMOTION FROM

657
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
THE PRESIDENT.

658
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I WAS SITTING A FEW FEET AWAY

659
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
FROM JAY CARNEY, THE WHITE HOUSE

660
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
SPOKESMAN.
HE TOOK HIS EYEGLASSES OFF AT

661
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
ONE POINT, WAS WIPING HIS EYES

662
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
AS THE PRESIDENT SPOKE.

663
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
YOU DON'T NORMALLY SEE THAT,

664
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
OBVIOUSLY, AROUND HERE AT THE

665
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
WHITE HOUSE WHEN THEY'VE BEEN

666
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
GOING THROUGH THE FISCAL CLIFF

667
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
AND ALL THESE OTHER MAJOR

668
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
ISSUES.
ALL THAT IS ON THE SIDE LINES

669
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
NOW, AT LEAST FOR A FEW DAYS.

670
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
BOTTOM LINE, YOU MENTIONED THE

671
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
FLAGS LOWERED TO HALF-STAFF

672
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
HERE.
THEY HAVE TO GO FORWARD WITH THE

673
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT, THOUGH,

674
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
BECAUSE AS YOU ALSO NOTED, THE

675
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
PRESIDENT CALLED THE CONNECTICUT

676
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
GOVERNOR TODAY.
HE HAVE ALSO CALLED THE F.B.I.

677
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
DIRECTOR, ROBERT MULLER, AND

678
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
PLEDGED ALL FEDERAL RESOURCES TO

679
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
ASSIST IN THIS INVESTIGATION,

680
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
HELP STATE AND LOCAL

681
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
AUTHORITIES.
AS I MENTIONED IN TERMS OF THE

682
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
FISCAL CLIFF, THE PRESIDENT WAS

683
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
SUPPOSED TO TRAVEL TO MAINE NEXT

684
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
WEDNESDAY.

685
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
PRESSURE REPUBLICANS OUT ON THE

686
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
ROAD ABOUT GETTING A FISCAL

687
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
CLIFF DEAL.

688
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'M TOLD THAT TRIP HAS BEEN

689
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
CANCELED.
THEY MAY OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BE

690
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
DEALING WITH A MEMORIAL SERVICE

691
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
NEXT WEEK, BILL.

692
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
>> Bill: ED, THERE WAS A MENTION

693
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
TODAY WHERE THE PRESIDENT SEEMED

694
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
TO MAKE NEWS ON GUN CONTROL.

695
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
WHAT WAS SAID THERE?

696
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
>> HE DID.

697
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
EARLIER WHEN THERE HAD BEEN

698
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
OTHER TRAGEDIES, WHETHER IT BE

699
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
TUCSON OR AURORA, THE PRESIDENT

700
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
SPOKE GENERALLY ABOUT A NATIONAL

701
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
CONVERSATION ON THIS ISSUE, BUT

702
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
HAD NOT FOLLOWED UP WITH ACTION.

703
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
TODAY HE SUGGESTED VERY CLEARLY

704
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
THAT IN A SECOND TERM, THAT MAY

705
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
CHANGE.
TAKE A LISTEN.

706
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
>> THESE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE OUR

707
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
NEIGHBORHOODS AND THESE CHILDREN

708
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
ARE OUR CHILDREN.

709
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME

710
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
TOGETHER AND TAKE MEANINGFUL

711
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
ACTION TO PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES

712
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
LIKE THIS, REGARDLESS OF THE

713
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
POLITICS.
>> Bill: CAPTAIN MARK KELLY, THE

714
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
HUSBAND OF FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN

715
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
GABBY GIFFORDS, WHO IS STILL

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
RECOVERING FROM THAT SHOOTING IN

717
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
TUCSON, HE TODAY SAID THAT SHE

718
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
SENDS HER PRAYERS FROM TUCSON TO

719
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
THE PEOPLE THERE WHERE YOU ARE

720
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
IN CONNECTICUT AND CAPTAIN KELLY

721
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
ADDED THAT HE BELIEVES A

722
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION OF THOSE

723
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
GUN LAWS IS LONG OVERDUE.

724
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
BILL.
>> Bill: THANK YOU.

725
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
ED HENRY ON THE NORTH LAWN AT

726
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
THE WHITE HOUSE.
WE'RE WATCHING THIS MEMORIAL

727
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
HERE IN NEWTOWN.

728
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
THE GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT HAS

729
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
JUST GONE TO THE PULPIT THERE.

730
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
LET'S DROP IN HERE FOR A QUICK

731
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
MOMENT.

WHO ARE WITH US TODAY AND THOSE

733
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
WHO WERE TAKEN AWAY.

734
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
MY GOD BLESS THE ADULTS WHO LOST

735
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
THEIR LIVES TODAY.

736
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
JERSEY, ALONG WITH THE BROTHER,

921
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
RYAN LANZA, WHO EARLIER TODAY

922
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
WAS BEING IDENTIFIED AS THE

923
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
SHOOTER.

924
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
APPARENTLY THERE WAS CONFUSION

925
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
BECAUSE ADAM LANZA, MAY HAVE

926
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
BEEN CARRYING HIS BROTHER'S I.D

927
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
THAT MAY HAVE LED THEM TO THE

928
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
BROTHER'S APARTMENT IN HOBOKEN.

929
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
THAT'S WHERE THEY FOUND THE

930
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
BROTHER, RYAN, QUESTIONED HIM.

931
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I'M TOLD HE IS BEING

932
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
COOPERATIVE.

933
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
HIS GIRLFRIEND BEING COOPERATIVE
AS WELL.

934
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
AND THE FATHER HAS BEEN

935
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
DESCRIBED AS BEING COOPERATIVE,

936
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
TOO.
THERE ARE SOME REPORTS THAT THE

937
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
FAMILY HASN'T REALLY SPOKEN WITH

938
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
ADAM MUCH LATELY.

939
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
WE CAN'T CONFIRM THAT.

940
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THE

941
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
FATHER AND THE BROTHER ARE BEING

942
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
QUESTIONED BY THE F.B.I

943
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
ANY INSIGHT THEY MAY BE ABLE TO

944
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
GIVE TO ADAM'S MENTAL STATE

945
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE VALUABLE IN

946
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
THIS INVESTIGATION.

947
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
BILL.
>> Bill: YEAH.

948
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL.
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

949
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT

950
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
INVESTIGATORS GO IMMEDIATELY TO

951
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THIS

952
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
KILLER HA HAD WITH HIS MOM.

953
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
IS THERE ANY SIGN THAT ANYONE

954
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
HAS TALKED ABOUT THAT MAY HAVE

955
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
SPARKED THIS RAMPAGE?

956
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
>> NO IDEA.
NONE WHATSOEVER.

957
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
AND WHEN I WAS TALKING TO ONE OF

958
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
MY SOURCES, A FEDERAL AGENT WHO

959
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
HAS SEEN IT ALL AND DONE SO MUCH

960
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
IN THE FIELD OF LAW ENFORCEMENT,

961
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
HE WAS AS STUNNED AS WE ALL ARE

962
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
AT THE WAY THESE EVENTS

963
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
UNFOLDED.

964
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
STUNNED THAT NOT ONLY THIS YOUNG

965
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
MAN WHO SHOOT AND KILL HIS OWN

966
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
MOTHER IN HER OWN HOME, BUT THEN

967
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
MORE STUNNED THAT HE WOULD THEN

968
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
GO THE SCHOOL AND OPEN FIRE.

969
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
HIS MOTHER WASN'T THERE.

970
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
HIS MOTHER WAS HOME.

971
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
HE WENT TO THE SCHOOL AND KILLED

972
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
THOSE PEOPLE, ACCORDING TO

973
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
AUTHORITIES AND IT'S JUST, AT

974
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
THIS POINT, NO EXPLANATION WHY.

975
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
>> Bill: RICK, THANK YOU.

976
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
RICK LEVENTHAL HAS BEEN ON SCENE

977
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
ALL DAY.

978
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
THE NEWS BROKE AROUND 9:30 IN

979
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
THE MORNING AND ABOUT AN HOUR

980
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
LATER WHEN ALL THE DETAILS

981
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
STARTED TO UNFOLD, IT JUST GOT

982
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
WORSE EVERY TIME A REPORT CAME

983
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
OUT AND HERE WE ARE TONIGHT

984
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
TRYING TO PIECE THIS TOGETHER.

985
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
POLICE IN HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY,

986
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
SAY THAT THEY ARE TALKING AND

987
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
QUESTIONING THE SUSPECTED

988
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
GUNMAN'S BROTHER, AS RICK WAS

989
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
TALKING ABOUT.

990
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
AND TWO PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE HIS

991
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
ROOMMATES IN NEW JERSEY.

992
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
HOBOKEN RIGHT ACROSS THE HUDSON

993
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
RIVER FROM MANHATTAN IN NEW YORK

994
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
CITY.
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER SEEING

995
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
PICTURES OF IT UNDER WATER AFTER

996
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
SUPER STORM SANDY.

997
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
ANNA KOOIMAN IS LIVE IN HOBOKEN.

998
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
WHAT ARE YOU FIGURING OUT ABOUT

999
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
THE SCENE AND WHAT IT'S LIKE

1000
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
BEHIND YOU THERE?

1001
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
>> BILL, YES, WE'RE PIECING

1002
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
THINGS TOGETHER JUST AS YOU ARE.

1003
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
THE BUILDING BEHIND US

1004
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
APPARENTLY, THE APARTMENT HOME

1005
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
OF THE BROTHER OF THE SHOOTER,

1006
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
24-YEAR-OLD RYAN LANZA, AS WELL

1007
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
AS TWO OTHER PEOPLE.

1008
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
THE BUILDING IS STILL ROPED OFF

1009
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
WITH POLICE TAPE.

1010
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
WE GOT ON THE SCENE ABOUT 4:30

1011
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
THIS AFTERNOON AND WE COUNTED

1012
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
ABOUT TEN F.B.I. AGENTS AND

1013
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
HOBOKEN POLICE HERE.
THEY DID BEGIN WRAPPING THINGS

1014
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
UP SHORTLY AFTER.

1015
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
BUT EARLIER TODAY, A VERY

1016
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
DIFFERENT SCENE.

1017
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
CHAOS AND CONFUSION,  WHICH MAY

1018
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
HAVE BEEN SPARKED BY A BIT OF

1019
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
INFORMATION WE RECEIVED FROM A

1020
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
RELIABLE FEDERAL SOURCE THAT

1021
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
RYAN LANZA'S I.D. ENDED UP ON

1022
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
ADAM LANZA.

1023
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
THAT FEDERAL SOURCE ALSO TELLING

1024
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
US THAT EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON

1025
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
WHEN RYAN LANZA PULLED UP TO

1026
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
THIS APARTMENT BUILDING WITH HIS

1027
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
GIRLFRIEND, HE NOTICED POLICE

1028
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
SURROUNDING IT.

1029
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
THAT'S WHEN HE WAS CUFFED AND

1030
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
TAKEN AWAY APPARENTLY.

1031
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
HE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND BOTH

1032
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
SPEAKING WITH THE F.B.I. AND

1033
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
ALSO COOPERATING WITH THEM.

1034
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
THERE HAD BEEN REPORTS THAT THE

1035
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
GIRLFRIEND WAS MISSING.

1036
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
THAT APPARENTLY NOT THE CASE.

1037
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
ALSO SOME PRELIMINARY REPORTS

1038
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
THAT SOMEBODY WAS DEAD INSIDE

1039
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
THIS BUILDING.
THAT NOT THE CASE, FROM

1040
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE HEARING.

1041
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
WE'VE EVEN HEARD IT WAS POSSIBLY

1042
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
THE FATHER.

1043
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
AGAIN, AS RICK LEVENTHAL

1044
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
MENTIONED, THAT FEDERAL SOURCE

1045
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
TELLING US THAT THE FATHER IS

1046
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
SPEAKING WITH THE F.B.I. HERE IN

1047
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
NEW JERSEY, BILL.

1048
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
>> Bill: YOU CAN IMAGINE, TOO,
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

1049
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
IS FACT AND WHAT IS FRANKLY NOT

1050
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
FACTS.
HOBOKEN A CROWDED COMMUNITY AND

1051
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
THERE ARE A LOT OF NEIGHBORS

1052
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
THERE.
HOW ARE THEY REACT TO GO WHAT

1053
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
THEY SAW AT THAT SCENE TODAY?

1054
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
>> THEY WATCHED IT UNFOLD JUST

1055
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
LIKE THE REST OF US DID AND WHEN

1056
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
THE FOCUS SHIFTED EVER SO

1057
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
SLIGHTLY TO HOBOKEN, OF COURSE,

1058
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
THEY BECAME EVEN MORE CONCERNED.

1059
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
SOME PARENTS TELLING US THE

1060
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
DAYCARE IN THE AREA WAS ON

1061
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
LOCKDOWN.
THEY WERE GETTING E-MAILS ABOUT

1062
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
THAT. LET'S TAKE LISTEN.

1063
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
>> JUST RIPS THROUGH YOU.

1064
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1065
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
YOU DON'T EXPECT ON A FRIDAY

1066
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
AFTERNOON AT 2:00 O'CLOCK THAT

1067
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
THE JERSEY CITY BOMB SQUAD WOULD

1068
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
BE RUNNING THROUGH YOUR HALLS.

1069
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
YOU THINK YOUR FAMILY IS HAVING

1070
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
A NORMAL DAY OFF AFTERNOON AND

1071
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
PLAYING WITH HIS TRUCKS AND

1072
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
BEING WHO HE IS AND HE HAS TO

1073
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
DEAL WITH THIS.

1074
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
>> BILL, RESIDENTS IN HOBOKEN

1075
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
AND CONNECTICUT REALLY ACROSS

1076
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
AMERICA, HUGGING THEIR CHILDREN

1077
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
A LITTLE TIGHTER TONIGHT.

1078
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
>> Bill: INDEED THEY ARE.

1079
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
THANK YOU.

1080
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
ANNA KOOIMAN IS ON DUTY IN

1081
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY, FOLLOWING

1082
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
THAT ASPECT OF THE STORY.

1083
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
WHEN THERE IS MORE INFORMATION

1084
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
FROM HOBOKEN, WE'LL TAKE YOU

1085
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
BACK THERE LIVE.

1086
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES HERE.

1087
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
IN A MOMENT, THE EMOTIONAL

1088
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
REACTION THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM

1089
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
PARENTS WHO SAY THEY HAVE NEVER

1090
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
IMAGINED THE HORROR WOULD UNFOLD

1091
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
THE WAY IT DID TODAY.

1092
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
THAT IS STILL AHEAD AS FOX

1093
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
REPORTS LIVE FROM NEWTOWN,

1094
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
CONNECTICUT TONIGHT.

1095
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
There is no
mass-produced human.

1096
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
So we created the
extraordinarily

1097
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
comfortable Sleep Number
Experience.

1098
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
around a bed with DualAir
Technology that allows you

1099
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
to adjust to the support
your body needs - each of

1100
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000

PROBABLY 8:00  O'CLOCK TOMORROW

1143
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
MORNING.

1144
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SHOOTING FOR.

1145
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS AND I'LL

1146
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
TRY AND ANSWER THEM IF I CAN.

1147
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
>> ANYTHING ABOUT THE INJURED

1148
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
VICTIM?
>> IT WAS A FEMALE EMPLOYEE OF

1149
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
THE SCHOOL WHO WAS WOUNDED, WHO

1150
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
WAS INJURED.

1151
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
AND IS DOING WELL.

1152
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
DEFINITELY, YES.
>> ARE ALL THE BODIES STILL

1153
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
INSIDE THE SCHOOL?

1154
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
>> I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO

1155
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
DETAILS.
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER HAS BEEN ON

1156
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
THE SCENE WITH ALL THE PROPER

1157
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
PERSONNEL AND THEY'LL DO WHAT

1158
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

1159
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
AGAIN, PRIMARILY WHAT WE'RE

1160
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
LOOKING AT NOW IS THE POSITIVE

1161
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I.D. TO GIVE SOME CLOSURE TO

1162
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
PEOPLE.

1163
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
>> WE'RE HEARING SO MANY ROUNDS

1164
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
WERE FIRED.
CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT?

1165
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY

1166
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
PAIN-STAKING PROCESS.

1167
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
>> I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT

1168
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
BETTER MYSELF.

1169
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
THIS IS -- THE WAY WE

1170
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
INVESTIGATE MAJOR CRIMES AND FOR

1171
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
THOSE OF YOU THAT AREN'T HERE ON

1172
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
A REGULAR BASIS, IT'S A VERY

1173
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
METICULOUS PROCESS.
WE LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED.

1174
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
WE USE ALL THE RESOURCES WE HAVE

1175
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
AVAILABLE TO US.
WE WILL DO THAT IN THIS CASE AND

1176
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
THEN SOME.

1177
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
THIS IS A CASE OF EXTREMELY

1178
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
LARGE MAGNITUDE, AS YOU KNOW,

1179
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
BETWEEN NEWTOWN AND STATE POLICE

1180
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
AND OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS THAT WE

1181
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
UTILIZED AND EVEN OUT OF STATE

1182
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
PARTNERS WILL HELP US REACH OUT

1183
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
OF STATE IF ANYTHING CROSSES THE

1184
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
STATE BORDERS.

1185
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME.

1186
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
WE WILL BE PROCESSING THIS

1187
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
BUILDING AND I'M JUST

1188
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
SPECULATING RIGHT NOW, BUT AT

1189
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
LEAST UNTIL SUNDAY.

1190
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
>> HAVE THE PARENTS BEEN GIVEN

1191
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
ACCESS TO THE BODIES OF THE

1192
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
CHILDREN?
>> NO.

1193
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
>> HOW ARE YOU MANAGING THE

1194
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
IDENTIFICATION.
>> WE'VE PROCESS IN PLACE AND

1195
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
WE'RE GOING TO ESTABLISH.

1196
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
WE HAVE A PROCESS ESTABLISHED, I

1197
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
SHOULD SAY, IN PLACE THAT WE'RE

1198
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
GOING TO UTILIZE TO IDENTIFY

1199
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
EACH INDIVIDUAL.

1200
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
>> THE IDENTIFICATION TOMORROW

1201
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
(INAUDIBLE).

1202
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
>> CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC WE CAN

1203
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
HAVE POSITIVE I.D. TOMORROW.

1204
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
THAT'S THE PROFESSIONALS TELLING

1205
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
US THAT, SPECIFICALLY THE

1206
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER AND HIS TEAM.

1207
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
OUR INVESTIGATORS AND WORKING

1208
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
TOGETHER, WE'RE HOPING TO

1209
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
ACCOMPLISH THAT.
THE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED.

1210
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
THE PRELIMINARY IDENTIFICATION

1211
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
HAS BEEN MADE AND THROUGH

1212
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
PROCESS OF ELIMINATION, THE

1213
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
FAMILIES HAVE BEEN TOLD.

1214
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
WE WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY,

1215
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
POSITIVELY SURE.

1216
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
>> YOU STILL HAD YOUR EYE ON THE

1217
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
SCENE EARLIER WHEN IT WAS CRAZY.

1218
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
WHAT WAS THEIR ROLE?

1219
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
IS THERE STILL A ROLE FOR THEM?

1220
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
>> CERTAINLY, THEY'RE WITH US
WORKING WITH US.

1221
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
THERE WERE FEDERAL PARTNERS FROM

1222
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
THE F.B.I., ATF, ALL OFFERING A

1223
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
SERVICES AND ANY SPECIALIZATION

1224
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
THEY HAVE, OFFERING A ABILITY IN

1225
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
CASE SOMETHING CROSSES STATE

1226
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
LINES.
SIMPLY STATED, EVERYONE HAS COME

1227
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
TOGETHER IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

1228
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
COMMUNITY.
THIS IS A MASSIVE INVESTIGATION.

1229
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

1230
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
NEVER HAVE TO UNDERTAKE.

1231
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
WE'RE CERTAINLY NEWTOWN, STATE

1232
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
POLICE WORK SIDE BY SIDE AND

1233
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
UTILIZING ANY RESOURCE THAT WE

1234
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
MAY NEED AND WE'RE VERY

1235
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
APPRECIATIVE OF ALL THE HELP

1236
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
WE'RE GETTING.

1237
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
>> YOU SAID THIS MORNING IS

1238
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
THERE ANYONE BUT THE PERPETRATOR

1239
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
INSIDE YET INVOLVED?

1240
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
ANY ACCOMPLICE?

1241
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
>> NO, AT THIS POINT IN TIME,

1242
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE THE

1243
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
SHOOTER IN THIS INCIDENT.

1244
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
>> IN THE CLASSROOM, EVERY CHILD

1245
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
(INAUDIBLE)?
>> I'D RATHER NOT DO THAT, QUITE

1246
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
FRANKLY.
I'VE BEEN A TROOPER A LONG TIME.

1247
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
MY LIEUTENANT HAS BEEN IN LAW

1248
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
ENFORCEMENT A LONG TIME.

1249
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT SERVES

1250
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
NO USEFUL PURPOSE.

1251
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
IT'S HORRIFIC SCENE BETWEEN OUR

1252
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
MUTUAL EXPERIENCE AND WE'VE

1253
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

1254
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
IT'S HARD WRENCHING FOR US AS IT

1255
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
IS FOR THE FAMILIES.

1256
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I JUST WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE THAT.

1257
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
>> IS THERE AN ISSUE WITH THE

1258
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
SCHOOL?
DID HE ATTEND THE SCHOOL?

1259
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
>> WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO, WE'RE

1260
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
LOOKING AT THAT.
WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE

1261
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
HISTORY.

1262
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
WE'LL GO BACKWARDS AS FAR AS WE
HAVE TO GO IN THIS INVESTIGATION

1263
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL STUMBLE ON

1264
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
ANSWERS AND WE'LL HOPEFULLY

1265
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
NOT -- BUT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

1266
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
BUILD A PROCESS AND BUILD A

1267
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
STORY AND AN INVESTIGATION LIKE

1268
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
THIS IS LIKE A PUZZLE.

1269
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
WE WANT TO PUT THIS PUZZLE

1270
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
TOGETHER AND FORM A COMPLETE

1271
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
PICTURE SO THAT EVERYONE WITHOUT

1272
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
ANY DOUBT WHATSOEVER CAN

1273
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT OCCURRED.

1274
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY IS THAT

1275
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
WE'LL COME BACK TOMORROW IN THE

1276
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
MORNING, LET'S SAY 8:00  O'CLOCK

1277
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000

I DON'T WANT TO DO IT[-WL8LqúL

1283
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000

I WANT TO DO ONE FINAL LIST.

AND THE TROOPERS, THEIR TRAINING

1298

KICKED IN.

1299
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU TRAIN FOR.

1300
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
YOU PLAN FOR, YOU WORK TOWARDS.

1301
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
YOU HOPE YOU NEVER HAVE TO USE.

1302
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
AND THEIR TRAINING KICKED IN.

1303
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
THEY SAVED A LOT OF LIVES.

1304
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
THEY DID A GREAT JOB.

1305
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
VERY PROUD OF THEM.

1306
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
>> TELL US ABOUT THE SHOOTER.

1307
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000

>> WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT

1309
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
THE SHOOTER?

1310
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
>> I'D RATHER DO THAT IN THE

1311
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
MORNING.

1312
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
ONCE WE HAVE POSITIVE
IDENTIFICATION OF THE SHOOTER,

1313
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
WE WANT TO HAVE ALL THAT

1314
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000

00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
TIE UP SOME LOOSE ENDS FIRST

1316
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000

HE REQUESTS SOME EQUIPMENT

1326
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT IN FOR HIM.

1327
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
THEY'RE THERE WORKING NOW.

1328
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
>> HOW DID YOU FIRST HEAR ABOUT

1329
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
THIS SHOOTING?

1330
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
DID YOU HEAR -- WHAT WERE THE

1331
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
FIRST WORDS?

1332
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
>> IN A NUTSHELL, IT WAS A 911

1333
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
CALL THAT CAME IN TO NEWTOWN

00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
POLICE AND THE RESPONSE WAS

1335
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
INSTANT.
>> FROM WITHIN THE SCHOOL?

1336
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
>> YEAH.
>> ONE OR MULTIPLE CALLS?

1337
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
>> I'M NOT SURE.

1338
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
YES, I BELIEVE SO.

1339
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY

1340
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
OCCURRED.

1341
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
>> (INAUDIBLE) WHAT ARE THEY

1342
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000

1343
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000

IN FURTHERING THEIR PORTION OF

1348
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
THE INVESTIGATION.

1349
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
DIE KNOW THAT NEW JERSEY HAS

1350
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000

MENTIONED, BUT NOT TO READ

1353
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
ANYTHING INTO THAT.

1354
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
IS IF THERE IS SOMETHING

1355
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
SIGNIFICANT ABOUT REACHING OVER
A STATE LINE OR DOING SOMETHING

1356
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
THAT MAY BE RELATED TO THIS

1357
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
CASE, WE'RE NOT GOING TO HIDE IT

1358
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000

00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
WE'LL MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO YOU

1360
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000

BUT DON'T READ SOMETHING INTO IT

1363
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
JUST BECAUSE YOU HEAR WE'VE GONE

1364
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
TO AUTHORITIES IN ANOTHER STATE.

1365
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING

1366
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
REALLY.

1367
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
>> A NUMBER OF RESOURCES YOU

00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
EVERYBODY IS ALL HANDS ON DECK.

00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
WE'LL GET THIS DONE AND DO

1377
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO ACCOMPLISH

1378
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000

00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I'D LIKE TO DO IS GIVE YOU A

THANK YOU.

1386
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
>> Bill: THAT IS LIEUTENANT PAUL

1387
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
VANCE, CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE.

1388
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
FRANKLY, HE HAS BEEN A STANDUP

1389
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
GENTLEMAN THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE

1390
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
DAY TODAY.

1391
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
YOU JUST IMAGINE WHAT THAT MAN

1392
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
HAS SEEN INSIDE THAT SCHOOL

1393
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
BUILDING.
REALLY RIPS YOUR HEART OUT.

1394
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
HE SAID IT HIMSELF, HE HAS NEVER

1395
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN HIS

1396
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
LIFE.
IT DEFIES THE IMAGINATION TO SEE

1397
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
WHAT HE HAS GONE THROUGH SO FAR

1398
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
TODAY.
NO MORE BRIEFINGS TONIGHT.

1399
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
THE INFORMATION IS FRANKLY IT'S

1400
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
BEEN PRECIOUS AND FEW FOR

1401
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
SEVERAL HOURS AND THERE IS A

1402
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
REASON FOR THAT. THE POLICE HERE

1403
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
WANT TO BE CAREFUL THAT THEY'RE

1404
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
DOING EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING AT

1405
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
THE RIGHT TIME WITH THE RIGHT

1406
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
FACTS.
NEXT BRIEFING, HE SAID,

00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
8:00 A.M. TOMORROW MORNING WHEN

1408
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
HE BELIEVES THERE WILL BE

1409
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION GIVEN

1410
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
NOT JUST ON THE VICTIMS, BUT

1411
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
ALSO ON THE SHOOTER, THE GUNMAN

1412
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.

1413
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
MY COLLEAGUE, JONATHAN HUNT,

1414
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
BACK WITH ME THIS EVENING.

1415
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
THIS IS GOING TO BE A PAINFUL

1416
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
PROCESS AND IT JUST STARTS NOW.

1417
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
>> IT WILL BE A REALLY PAINFUL

1418
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
PROCESS.

1419
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
YOU COULD HEAR THE EMOTION

1420
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
THERE, BILL, IN LIEUTENANT

1421
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
VANCE'S VOICE WHEN HE TALKED

1422
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
ABOUT WHAT HE'S SEEN.

1423
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
HE TALKED ABOUT THE TRAINING

1424
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
THAT THE TEACHERS HAVE GONE

1425
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
THROUGH, THE TRAINING THAT THE

1426
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE GONE

1427
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
THROUGH.
AND HOW THAT KICKS IN.

1428
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, HE HAD TO

1429
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
ADMIT THIS THAT THERE IS NO WAY

1430
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
YOU CAN TRAIN FULLY FOR

1431
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1432
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
THAT'S WHY WE HEARD AND WE WERE

1433
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
TALKING ABOUT IT EARLIER, THE

1434
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
REPORTS THAT MANY OF THESE FIRST

1435
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
RESPONDERS WERE LEAVING THAT

1436
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
SCHOOL IN TEARS.

1437
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
JUST IMAGINE WITNESSING THAT

1438
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
SLAUGHTER, THE BODIES OF THOSE

1439
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
TINY CHILDREN ON THE GROUND.

1440
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
>> Bill: YEAH.
THE SCHOOL ITSELF IS A COUPLE

1441
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
HUNDRED YARDS FROM OUR LOCATION

1442
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
HERE.
WE'RE AT A LOCAL PARK CALLED

1443
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
TREADWELL PARK.

1444
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
YOU KNOW THAT THOSE KIDS PLAYED

1445
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
HERE AFTER SCHOOL AND THEY

1446
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
PROBABLY SPENT THE WEEKENDS HERE

1447
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
WITH THEIR FAMILY, SOCCER

1448
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
FIELDS, FOOTBALL FIELDS.

1449
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
YOU GO THROUGH THE FOREST HERE,

1450
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
DOWN A HILL BEFORE YOU COME UPON

1451
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
THE SCHOOL.

1452
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
INSIDE THAT SCHOOL IS THE CRIME

1453
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
SCENE THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO

1454
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
PIECE TOGETHER SO THAT WE HAVE A

1455
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
BETTER IDEA WHAT IN THE WORLD

1456
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
WAS GOING ON INSIDE THIS YOUNG

1457
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
MAN'S MIND.
