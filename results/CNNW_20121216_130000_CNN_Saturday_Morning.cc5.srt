00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
WAS TEN AND HE WAS 15.

189
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
HE DESCRIBED HIM AS FOCUSED,

190
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
QUIET, INTROVERTED.

191
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
HE NEVER SAW EVIDENCE OF VIE

192
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
BENS BUT SAID LANZA DID THROW

193
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
THE OCCASIONAL TEMPER TANTRUM.

194
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
>> HE WOULDN'T LIKE THAT AND HE

195
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
WOULD NOT WANT TO STOP WATCHING

196
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
TV.
I GUESS AT 10 YEARS OLD MOST ARE

197
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
OUT OF THAT PHASE, AND THAT

198
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
WASN'T THE CASE FOR ADAM.

199
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
>> CRAFT WAS ONLY A YEAR OLDER

200
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
THAN ADAM'S OLDER BROTHER RYAN.

201
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
HE SAYS THEIR MOTHER TOLD THEM

202
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
TO LET RYAN DO WHATEVER HE

203
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
WANTED, BUT AS FOR ADAM --

204
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
>> WHAT I REMEMBER CLEARLY IS

205
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
THAT NANCY ALWAYS ASKED ME TO

206
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
ALWAYS BE WITH HIM IN THE ROOM

207
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
NO MATTER WHAT.

208
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
DON'T GO TO THE BATHROOM, DON'T

209
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
EVER LEAVE HIM WITHOUT

210
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
SUPERVISION.
>> CRAFT SAYS ADAM HAD A

211
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH

212
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
HIS MOTHER, NANCY.

213
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000

NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS SAID SHE

221
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
ENJOYED GARDENING AND TOOK TIME

222
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
OFF FROM A JOB IN FINANCE.

223
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000

SHE WAS LIKE ANY OTHER

228
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
HOUSEWIFE.
>> BUT LIKE HER SON, THERE ARE

229
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
GAPS IN NANCY'S STORY THAT STILL

230
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
NEED TO BE FILLED IN.

231
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
SHE OWNED THE WEAPONS THAT ADAM

232
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
LANZA USED IN THE KILLINGS

233
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
INCLUDING A SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE

234
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
AND IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY SHE

235
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
PURCHASED THEM.

558
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
HE WAS VERY CLOSE WITH HER, AND

559
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
SHE REALLY LOVED THE CLASS.

560
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000

FACT THAT THIS GUNMAN, BAD GUY

579
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000

581

583
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
COMMUNITY AND FAMILIES.

732
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER BRINGS A

733
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
GREAT DEAL OF STRENGTH AND

734
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
COMFORT.

735
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I THINK PRAYER.

736
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY VEHICLE.

737
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
IT'S A POWERFUL VEHICLE TO

738
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
EXPRESS THOSE REALLY POWERFUL

739
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
EMOTIONS THAT GRIEF CAN BRING TO

740
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
US.
THE MORE THAT WE GATHER, THE

741
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
MORE THAT WE TALK ABOUT THIS, IT

742
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
HELPS US SEE THE VALUES WE WANT

743
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
TO BRING INTO OUR SOCIETY.

744
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
ALL OF THAT FOR ME IS REALLY

745
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
POSITIVE STEPS TOWARDS HOW TO

746
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
DEAL WITH SUCH AN UNSPEAKABLE

747
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
TRAGEDY.

748
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
>> THE CHURCH IN NEWTOWN HAS

749
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
BEEN OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY.

750
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
WE SEE PICTURES OF PACKED

751
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
CHURCHES AND VIGILS.

752
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING ROBBIE

753
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
PARKER SAID, AND THEN WE'RE

754
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
GOING TO DISCUSS IT.

755
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
>> THAT FREE AGENCY IS GIVEN TO

756
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
ALL OF US TO ACT AND CHOOSE

757
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
WHATEVER WE WANT.

758
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM

759
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
US.
I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING HE WAS

760
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
GIVEN, AND THAT'S WHAT HE CHOSE

761
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
TO DO WITH IT.

762
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I KNOW GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY.

763
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I'M NOT MAD.

764
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
>> THE QUESTION OF FATE AND

765
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
DESTINY AND FREE AGENCY, TRY TO

766
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
SORT THAT OUT FOR US.

767
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, I BELIEVE WE

768
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
HAVE FREE WILL, AND THAT WE'VE

769
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
BEEN GIVEN ALL THE TOOLS TO

770
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
CREATE A SOCIETY THAT PROTECTS

771
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
OUR CHILDREN AND CARES FOR OUR

772
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
CHILDREN, AND THEN IN SOME WAYS

773
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW WE HAVE

774
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
FAILED WHEN WE HAVE MOMENTS LIKE

775
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
THIS.

776
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
SO I UNDERSTAND THIS IDEA OF NOT

777
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
BEING ANGRY AT GOD.

778
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I WANT TO SAY IT'S OKAY TO BE

779
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
ANGRY RIGHT NOW.

780
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
WITH GRIEF WE HAVE MANY, MANY

781
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
FEELINGS, AND I THINK FAITH CAN

782
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
HANDLE ALL OF THEM.

783
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I THINK THAT THIS WASN'T

784
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
DESTINED.
THERE ARE THINGS WE COULD HAVE

785
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
DONE.
IN SOME WAYS THE PIECE OF GRIEF

786
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
THAT IS THE HARDEST IS HOW DO WE

787
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
LOOK AT HOW WE'RE RESPONSIBLE.

788
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
THAT MAY NOT BE THE FIRST PLACE

789
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
WE GO.

790
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
RIGHT NOW IT'S REALLY JUST ABOUT

791
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
REACHING OUT AND, YOU KNOW,

792
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
BLESSING OUR CHILDREN, MAKING

793
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE

794
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
THE SENSE OF SAFETY AND SECURITY

795
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
THAT THEY NEED AND FRANKLY WE

796
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
NEED AT THIS MOMENT, TOO.

797
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

798
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
OUR CONVERSATION IS MORE ABOUT

799
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
FAITH.

800
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING MIKE

801
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
HUCKABEE SAID, I WANT TO TALK

802
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
ABOUT THIS, FORMER PASTOR,

803
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
FORMER GOVERNOR AND FORMER

804
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.

805
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
HE SAID WE ASK WHY THEY'RE

806
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
VIOLENCE IN OUR SCHOOL, BUT WE

807
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
SYSTEMICALLY REMOVED GOD FROM

808
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
OUR SCHOOLS.

809
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
SHOULD WE BE SO SURPRISED

810
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
SCHOOLS ARE SUCH A PLACE OF

811
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
CARNAGE?
PEOPLE WILL MAKE A SDID

812
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
POLITICALLY IF THEY AAGREE OR

813
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
NOT, BUT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THE

814
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN FAITH

815
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
AND VIOLENCE?

816
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
CAN YOU PREY AWAY THE TENDENCY

817
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO

818
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
HAPPEN?

819
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
>> I DON'T THINK PRAYER IS THE

820
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
ONLY TOOL, AND I THINK OUR

821
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
SCHOOLS WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IN

822
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
TERMS OF TEACHING OUR CHILDREN

823
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
NONVIOLENT COMMUNICATION, WAYS

824
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
TO REDUCE BULLYING.

825
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
THESE KINDS OF THINGS THAT KEEP

826
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
OUR CHILDREN WITH A SENSE OF

827
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
SAFETY.
WHEN THEY DO FEEL UNSAFE, THE

828
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
WAY THAT THEY CONTINUE TO GROW.

829
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
SO FOR ME TEACHING VALUES RATHER

830
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
THAN PRAYER.

831
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
PRAYER CAN CERTAINLY HELP THAT,

832
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE WAY

833
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
TO GO BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY

834
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
OF FAITH IN THIS COUNTRY.

835
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
SHARED CIVIL VALUES, THAT WE

836
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
HAVE AS MULTIPLE FAITH HE

837
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
PEOPLE.
>> WE HAVE ABOUT 30 SECONDS

838
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
LEFT.
THIS IS PARTY SEASON.

839
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
LAST NIGHT OF HANUKKAH AND

840
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
CHRISTMAS IS A WEEK AWAY.

841
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
SOME PEOPLE PROBABLY FEEL GUILTY

842
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
CELEBRATING, DANCING WHEN THIS

843
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
IS HAPPENING.

844
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM?

845
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
>> I TELL THEM FROM MY FAITH

846
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
TRADITION, JUDAISM SAYS YOU HAVE

847
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
TO CLING TO LIFE.

848
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I THINK WE PERHAPS ACKNOWLEDGE

849
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
OUR LOSS, THE BUT IT DOESN'T

850
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
MEAN WE HAVE TO COMPLETELY

851
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
SEPARATE OURSELVES.
PERHAPS THE TIME TO REMOVE

852
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
EXCESS FROM OUR SENSE OF

853
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
PARTYING AND CONNECT TO THE REAL

854
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
SPIRIT OF THESE DAYS THAT TELL

855
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
US THAT FAMILY AND A SENSE OF

856
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
GRATITUDE FOR WHAT WE HAVE IS

857
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
REALLY IMPORTANT.

858
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
THAT'S WORTH CELEBRATING IN THE

859
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
MIDST OF THIS TRAGIC LOSS.

860
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000

875

I was worried the
health care system

876
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
spoke a language all its own

877
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
With UnitedHealthcare,
I got help that fit my life.

878
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000

00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
THE FIRST FEW DAYS ARE -- LET ME

915
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
ALSO SAY THAT EVERY TRAGEDY IS

916
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
INDIVIDUAL AND SPECIFIC, SO WE

917
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE

918
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
GOING THROUGH.

919
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
WE HAVE SOME IDEA WHAT THEY'RE

920
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
GOING THROUGH.
IF THEIR EXPERIENCE IS SIMILAR

921
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
IT TO OURS, THE FIRST FEW DAYS

922
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
ARE JUST SURREAL.

923
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
YOU CAN'T DESCRIBE THE PIT, I

924
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
GUESS, IS THE BEST WORD TO

925
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
DESCRIBE THAT YOU DESCEND INTO

926
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
IT.

927
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS YOU

928
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
GOING IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS IS

929
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
THE LOVE OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

930
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'M STRUCK BY HOW THAT COMMUNITY

931
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
IS PULLING TOGETHER IN THEIR

932
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
HOUSES OF WORSHIP AND JUST THE

933
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
STRENGTH OF THE COMMUNITY.

934
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
IT SEEMS TO BE CARRYING THEM

935
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
THROUGH.

936
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
THAT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL FOR

937
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
THEM IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WEEKS

938
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
AND MONTHS.

939
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
ABSOLUTELY.

940
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
>> PETER, IT'S REMARKABLE.
THERE'S SO MUCH LOVE IN THIS

941
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
TOWN.

942
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
THE CHURCHES HAVE SIGNS OUTDOORS

943
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
THAT SAY OPEN 24 HOURS.

944
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE ARE

945
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
SAYING, THE FAMILIES OF THE

946
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
VICTIMS, IS THAT THEY DON'T WANT

947
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
TO BE DEFINED BY THIS SHOOTING.

948
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
THEY DON'T WANT THIS TOWN AND

949
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
THEIR FAMILIES DEFINED BY THIS

950
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
AWFUL EVENT.
HAVING BEEN THROUGH THIS, IS

951
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
THAT POSSIBLE, AND HOW DO YOU

952
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
ACHIEVE THAT GOAL?

953
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
>> WELL, I WAS READING THIS

954
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
MORNING A QUOTE FROM EMILIE

955
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
PARKER'S FATHER WHERE HE SAID

956
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
THAT -- I WAS STRUCK BY HOW

957
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
SIMILAR TO THINGS THAT WERE SAID

958
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
AND SOME OF US SAID AMONGST

959
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
OURSELVES ABOUT VIRGINIA TECH.

960
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
INITIALLY FOR THE PUBLIC, I

961
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
THINK, MOST OF THE VICTIM NAMES

962
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
AND THE FAMILIES WILL BE DEFINED

963
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
BY THE TRAGEDY.

964
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I THINK AS THE STORIES OF THESE

965
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
CHILDREN AND THEIR TEACHERS

966
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
BECOME KNOWN, THEN THAT WILL

967
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
CHANGE.
NOW, WITHIN EACH FAMILY AND

968
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
WITHIN EACH GROUP CONNECTED TO

969
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
EACH INDIVIDUAL, IT'S VERY

970
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
PARTICULAR.

971
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
IT'S NOT -- YOU'RE NOT DEFINED

972
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
BY THE TRAGEDY AND THE NAME.

973
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
YOU'RE DEFINED BY THE PARTICULAR

974
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
LOSS THAT YOU SUFFERED.

975
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
SO IN EACH CASE THAT FAMILY NOW

976
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
HAS A HOLE IN IT THAT'S SHAPED

977
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
LIKE THAT PERSON THEY LOST.

978
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
THAT'S GOING TO GO FORWARD

979
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
THROUGH THEIR LIVES.

980
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
THE THING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

981
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
HAVE TO LEARN, AS WE'VE ALL HAD

982
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
TO LEARN, IS HOW IT TO LIVE

983
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
AROUND THAT LOSS.

984
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
YOU DON'T MOVE ON FROM IT.

985
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
YOU NEVER MOVE ON IT FROM IT.

986
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT, I DON'T

987
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THINKING.

988
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD AND FIND

989
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
WAYS TO MOVE FORWARD AND HONOR

990
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,000
THE MEMORY OF THE PERSON THAT

991
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
YOU'VE LOST IN HOW YOU LIVE YOUR

992
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
OWN LIFE.
>> ONE THING THAT STRUCK US,

993
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
PETER, IS WHEN YOU MENTIONED

994
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
ROBBIE PARKER SPEAKING ABOUT HIS

995
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
YOUNG, YOUNG DAUGHTER LAST

996
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
NIGHT.
HE SAID, I'M NOT MAD.

997
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
HE ALSO SENT HIS CONDOLENCES TO

998
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
THE FAMILY OF THE SHOOTER.

999
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
HE SENT HIS CONDOLENCES FOR THE

1000
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
FAMILY OF THE ADAM LANZA.

1001
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
IT STRUCK MANY OF US, THAT

1002
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
STRENGTH AND HUMILITY.

1003
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
HOW DO YOU SQUARE THAT WHEN YOU

1004
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
KNOW THE ANGER I'M SURE MANY ARE

1005
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
STILL FEELING?

1006
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
>> WELL, WE HAD SIMILAR EMOTIONS

1007
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
AND SIMILAR EXPERIENCES.

1008
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
SO I CAN UNDERSTAND HIS

1009
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
EXPRESSION OF THAT.

1010
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
WE HAD SIMILAR FEELINGS FOR THE

1011
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
FAMILY OF THE PERSON WHO DID

1012
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
WHAT HE DID AT VIRGINIA TECH.

1013
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
YOU CANNOT HOLD THE FAMILY

1014
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF

1015
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
THE INDIVIDUAL, AND THEY SUFFER

1016
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
A LOSS AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS

1017
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
ANY SUFFERED, AND THEY CARRY AN

1018
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
ADDITIONAL BURDEN BECAUSE JUST

1019
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
LIKE, YOU KNOW, I WOULD WONDER

1020
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
OR I'M SURE MR. PARKER WONDERS

1021
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE TO SAVE

1022
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
MY CHILD?

1023
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
THEY WONDER, WHAT COULD WE HAVE

1024
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
DONE TO MAKE THIS COME OUT

1025
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
DIFFERENTLY?

1026
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
THE ANSWER IS, PROBABLY NOTHING.

1027
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
THERE IS PROBABLY NOTHING THEY

1028
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY.

1029
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I CAN FULLY UNDERSTAND WHEN HE

1030
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
SAYS HE MAY BE ANGRY AT OTHER

1031
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
THINGS, BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY

1032
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
HE SAYS HE'S NOT ANGRY AT THAT

1033
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
FAMILY BECAUSE THAT'S -- THAT'S

1034
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
JUST KIND OF A FRUITLESS EMOTION

1035
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
AT THAT POINT.

1036
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE
SUFFERING A LOSS AS WELL.

1037
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
>> WELL, PETER READ, AT THIS

1038
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
TIME WHEN WE PAY TRIBUTE TO THE

1039
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
VICTIMS HERE IN CONNECTICUT, WE

1040
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
ALSO WANT TO PAY TRIBUTE TO YOUR

1041
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
DAUGHTER, THE DAUGHTER YOU LOST,

1042
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
19-YEAR-OLD MARY KAREN.

1043
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE READ AND

1044
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
HEARD ABOUT HER OVER THE YEARS

1045
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
IS SHE WAS A VERY WONDERFUL

1046
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
YOUNG WOMAN WITH A VERY BRIGHT

1047
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
WOMAN.
AND WE WANT TO PAY A TRIBUTE TO

1048
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
YOUR FAMILY AS WELL.

1049
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME

1050
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
TODAY.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1051
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE NEWS

1052
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
AFTER THE BREAK INCLUDING A

1053
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
POSSIBLE MOVE IN WASHINGTON, A

1054
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
MOVE FOR SENATOR JOHN KERRY

1055
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
PERHAPS HEADED TO THE STATE

1056
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
DEPARTMENT.

1057
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
>>> FIRST, WE WANT TO LISTEN TO

1058
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD TO SAY

1059
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
ABOUT THIS MASS SHOOTING.

1060
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
LIKE MANY OF US WHEN HE STARTED

1061
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED, THE

1062
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
PRESIDENT, HE COULD NOT HOLD

1063
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
BACK THE TEARS.
>> WE'VE ENDURED TOO MANY OF

1064
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
THESE TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST FEW

1065
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
YEARS.

1066
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I KNOW THERE'S NOT A PARENT IN

1067
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
AMERICA WHO DOESN'T FEEL THE

1068
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
SAME OVERWHELMING GRIEF THAT I

1069
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
DO.

1070
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO DIED

1071
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
TODAY WERE CHILDREN, BEAUTIFUL

1072
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
LITTLE KIDS BETWEEN THE AGES OF

1073
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
5 AND 10 YEARS OLD.

1074
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
THEY HAD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

1075
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
AHEAD OF THEM, BIRTHDAYS,

1076
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
GRADUATIONS, WEDDINGS, KIDS OF

1077
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
THEIR OWN.

1078
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

1079
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
TEACHERS, MEN AND WOMEN WHO

1080
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
DEVOTED THEIR LIVES IT TO

1081
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
HELPING OUR CHILDREN FULFILL

1082
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
THEIR DREECAMS.

1083
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE

1084
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
PAI
PARENTS OF THE SURVIVORS AS

1085
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
WELL.
AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE IT TO

1086
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME

1087
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
TONIGHT, THEY KNOW THEIR

1088
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
CHILDREN'S INNOCENCE HAS BEEN

1089
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
TORN AWAY FROM THEM TOO EARLY,

1090
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
AND THERE ARE NO WORDS TO EASE

1091
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
THIRP PAIN.

1092
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
THIS EVENING MICHELLE AND I WILL

1093
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
DO WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT IN
AMERICA WILL DO, WHICH IS HUG

1094
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
OUR CHILDREN A LITTLE TIGHTER

1095
