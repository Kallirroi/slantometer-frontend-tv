REMARKABLE ADULTS.

THEY LOST THEIR LIVES IN A

256
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
SCHOOL.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY SCHOOL.

IN A QUIET TOWN FULL OF GOOD AND

258
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
DECENT PEOPLE.

NATION.

263
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I AM VERY MINDFUL THAT MERE

264
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
WORDS CANNOT MATCH THE DEPTHS OF

265
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
YOUR SORROW.

266

I CAN ONLY HOPE IT HELPS FOR YOU

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN

269
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
YOUR GRIEF THAT OUR WORLD TOO

270
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
HAS BEEN TORN APART.

271
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000

THIS?
WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW?

>> I'M HOPING, ANDERSON, THIS

284
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
WILL BE THE TIPPING POINT IN OUR

285
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
COUNTRY.
I FEEL THAT CHILDREN ARE

286
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
INUNDATED WITH THE CULTURE OF

287
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
VIOLENCE FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE.

288
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
FROM THE TOYS THAT WE PLAY WITH

289
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
TO THE MOVIES THAT WE SEE AND

290
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
THE TV THAT WE SEE.

291
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
THAT WE CAN DO BETTER, AND WE

292
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
CAN MAKE GAMES THAT ARE EXCITING

293
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
THAT HAVE A POSITIVE OBJECTIVE.

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
AND WE REALLY NEED TO DO THAT,

295
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S TOO

296
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
COMMONPLACE, THE VIOLENT

297
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
REACTION.
OF COURSE, THE INDIVIDUAL IS

298
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
DERANGED BUT THERE'S A PART OF

299
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
ME THAT THINKS IF WE HAD MORE OF

300
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
A CULTURE OF PEACE THAT THESE

301
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
KIND OF EVENTS WOULD BE LESS

302
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
LIKELY TO HAPPEN.

303
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
>> WHAT ARE YOU HOPING COMES OUT

304
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
OF THIS?

305
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
>> WELL, I'M HOPING FOR OUR

306
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
COMMUNITY THAT THE COMMUNITY

307
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
GROWS EVEN CLOSER AND STRONGER.

308
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT

309
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
HOW CLOSE AND STRONG IT WAS

310
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
BEFORE.

311
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
BUT AS YOU KNOW, A TRAGEDY LIKE

312
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
THIS, WE'RE VERY VULNERABLE.

313
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
BUT I ALSO HAVE HOPE THAT WE CAN

314
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
BECOME STRONGER AND CLOSER AND

315
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
CARE FOR ONE ANOTHER IN DEEPER

316
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
WAYS.
>> IT'S EXTRAORDINARY JUST THE

317
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
LAST COUPLE DAYS, I'VE BEEN

318
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
HERE.
COMPLETE STRANGERS COME UP TO

319
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
ONE ANOTHER ON THE STREET AND

320
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
ARE HUGGING AND SHARING, SHARING

321
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
THEIR HEARTS WITH EACH OTHER.

322
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
>> THERE'S AN OUTPOURING.

323
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
NOT ONLY IN THE TOWN, BUT FOR

324
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD.

325
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
AND -- BUT THAT WILL SLOWLY

326
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
DISSIPATE.
AND THE ATTENTION WILL DISAPPEAR

327
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
FROM THIS PLACE, AND WE'LL BE

328
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
RETURNING TO LIVES THAT ARE

329
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
SUPPOSED TO BE NORMAL.

330
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
FOR MANY PEOPLE, THEY WON'T FEEL

331
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
NORMAL AGAIN.

332
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
HOW DO WE MAKE THOSE LIVES FEEL

333
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
CONNECTED AND CLOSER AND CARED

334
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
FOR, AND VIBRANT?

335
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS EVENT

336
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
TO ZEE FINE THE SPIRIT OF OUR

337
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
FAITH COMMUNITIES, THE SPIRIT OF

338
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
THIS COMMUNITY.

339
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
WE WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT

340
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
THERE IS SOMETHING MORE,

341
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
SOMETHING HOPEFUL, SOMETHING

342
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
THAT WE CAN EVEN BECOME MORE

343
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
COMPASSIONATE, MORE CARING, SOME

344
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
OF THE THINGS THAT WE JUST

345
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
TALKED ABOUT, HOW WE SEE PEOPLE

346
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
NOT JUST HERE IN TOWN, BUT IN

347
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
THE WORLD.

348
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
>> I'VE SEEN REPRESENTATIVES AND

349
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
REMEMBERS ON THE STAGE.

350
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
IT WAS A POWERFUL MOVING

351
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
STATEMENT.
WHAT DO YOU -- HOW -- THERE'S SO

352
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
MANY PARENTS AROUND THE WORLD

353
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
WHO ARE FOLLOWING THIS, WHO

354
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THEIR

355
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
CHILDREN, DON'T KNOW HOW TO

356
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
EXPLAIN IT.

357
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
HOW DO YOU COUNCIL SOMEBODY.

358
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM?

359
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
>> YOU MEAN, AROUND THE COUNTRY?

360
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
>> YEAH, OR HERE, ANYWHERE.

361
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
>> WE HAVE YOUNG ONES TOO, WE

362
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
HAVE FIRST GRADERS, WE WANT THEM

363
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
TO KNOW THAT SOMETHING BAD

364
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
HAPPENED.
WE HAVE TO TELL THEM SOMETHING.

365
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
WE HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING YET.

366
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
IT'S VERY UNUSUAL AND THE BAD

367
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
MAN CAN'T HURT ANYBODY ANY MORE.

368
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
THAT'S HOW WE WOULD, AS FIRST

369
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
GRADERS WE WOULD APPROACH THAT.

370
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
AND WE JUST NEED TO WORK TO MAKE

371
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
OUR COMMUNITY BETTER, AND NOT TO

372
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
BE AFRAID.

373
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
YOU'RE SAFE.
>> NO DOUBT YOU'VE HAD TO

374
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
COUNCIL PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST

375
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
LOVED ONES, WHAT DO YOU SAY IN

376
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
THAT -- IS THERE ANYTHING TO

377
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
SAY?
>> THERE ARE THINGS TO SAY, BUT

378
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I THINK OFTEN TIMES WE'RE

379
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
INCLINED TO WANT TO SAY THINGS

380
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
FIRST.

381
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I THINK LISTENING IS THE FIRST

382
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
RESPONSE, IS TO LISTEN TO

383
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
PEOPLE'S GRIEF, LISTEN TO WHAT

384
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
THEY'RE -- EVEN IF THEY CAN'T

385
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
ARTICULATE NOT COMING IN

386
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
THINKING THAT A CERTAIN WORD,

387
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
PHRASE OR EVEN PEOPLE OF FAITH,

388
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
CERTAIN SCRIPTURES WILL JUST

389
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
SOLVE OR HEAL INSTANTLY.

390
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
BUT THOSE WORDS OF SCRIPTURE,

391
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
THOSE WORDS ARE SIGNIFICANT.

392
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
BUT REALIZING THAT WE HAVE TO

393
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
CONTINUE TO LISTEN AND TO FIND

394
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
APPROPRIATE WAYS WITH THEM TO

395
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
FIND EXPRESSION AND A MEANING

396
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
THAT COME OUT OF OUR TRADITIONS.

397
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
FOLKS I COUNCIL IN MY OWN

398
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
TRADITION.
THAT WOULD BE WHAT I DROP ON.

399
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
>> THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS

400
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
SOMETHING -- THAT PAIN NEVER

401
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
GOES AWAY.

402
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
>> IT'S REALLY HORRIBLE.

403
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
AND WHEN YOU SEE THE PARENTS

404
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
WAILING LIKE THAT, YOU REALIZE,

405
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
THAT'S HOW WE WOULD BE IF WE

406
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
WERE THERE TOO.

407
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
THESE ARE ALL OF OUR CHILDREN.

408
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
AND SO -- I THINK MATT SAID IT

409
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
VERY WELL, YOU TAKE YOUR CUES,

410
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
SOME PEOPLE WILL LIKE A

411
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
THEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION.

412
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
NOAH'S MOTHER, I TOLD HER THIS

413
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
MORNING, WHERE IS THE 6-YEAR-OLD

414
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
INSIDE OF YOU READY TO GO?

415
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
AND SHE SAID, WELL, IT'S STILL

416
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
IN ME.

417
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
IN A SENSE,HERE'S A SPIRITUAL

418
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
IDEA THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT,

419
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
THERE'S A TRANSFORMATION, AS WE,

420
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
THROUGH NATION GROW OUR

421
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
6-YEAR-OLD IS STILL SURROUNDED

422
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
BY THE GREATER ASPECT OF

423
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
OURSELVES AS WE GROW AND MATURE.

424
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
AND SO IT'S A LEAP OF FAITH TO

425
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
SAY AFTER WE LEAVE OUR BODY THAT

426
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
WE BECOME PART OF A GREATER

427
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
MATRIX OR A GREATER MOTIF IN THE

428
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
UNIVERSE.

429
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
>> I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU FOR

430
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
BEING WITH US TONIGHT, BUT ALSO

431
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
JUST BEING ON THE STAGE AND WHAT

432
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
YOU SAID, I THOUGHT IT WAS

433
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
EXTRAORDINARILY POWERFUL.
>> THANK YOU.

434
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> WISH YOU THE BEST.

435
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
>>> WHEN WE COME BACK,

436
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
REMEMBERING PRINCIPAL DAWN

437
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
HOCHSPRUNG.
I'M WITH HER HUSBAND AND

438
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
CHILDREN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

439
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
THIS FAMILY USED
Capital One Venture Miles

440
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
TO COME HOME
FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

441
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
THAT'S DOUBLE MILES
YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE...

442
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
SADLY, THEIR BROTHER'S

JUST GOT "BLACKED OUT."

444
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
[ Brother ]
BUT IT'S THE FAMILY PARTY!

445
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000

YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE!

451
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
HOW ILLUMINATING.

452
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
WHAT'S IN YOUR WALLET?

453
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
LET ME GUESS, AM I
ON THE NAUGHTY LIST AGAIN?

454
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
HO HO HO!

455
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
>>> THE PRINCIPAL WHO -- GOD

456
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
BLESS HER LOST HER LIFE.

457
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
SHE WAS A VERY SPECIAL PERSON.

458
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
AND YOU WILL THE PARENTS KNEW

459
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
THAT.
>> THE PRINCIPAL OF SANDY HOOK

460
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
ELEMENTARY WAS RESPECTED AND

461
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
ADMIRED BY THE TEACHERS AND

462
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
PARENTS AND LOVED BY THE

463
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
STUDENTS AS WELL.

464
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
DAWN HOCHSPRUNG WAS HER NAME,

465
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
SHE BECAME PRINCIPAL TWO YEARS

466
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
AGO, SHE WAS A MOM OF ONE OF THE

467
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
FIRST GRADERS, SHE NEVER SAW HER

468
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
WITHOUT A SMILE, ON THAT AWFUL

469
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
DAY AT THAT SCHOOL WHO SURVIVED,

470
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
SAY DAWN DIED PROTECTING THEM,

471
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
CONFRONTING THE GUNMAN HERSELF.

472
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
IT WAS A TERRIBLE LOSS OF A

473
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
BELOVED PRINCIPAL, MORE

474
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
IMPORTANTLY, OF A WIFE, MOTHER

475
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
AND GRANDMOTHER.

476
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
TONIGHT HER DAUGHTER POSTED THIS

477
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
PICTURE ON TWITTER OF PRESIDENT

478
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
OBAMA HOLDING DAWN HOCHSPRUNG'S

479
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
GRANDDAUGHTER.
MY MOM WOULD BE SO PROUD TO SEE

480
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HOLDING HER

481
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
DAUGHTER.
BUT NOT AS PROUD AS I AM ABOUT

482
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
HER.

483
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
GARY TUCHMAN SPOKE TO THE FAMILY

484
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
ABOUT WHAT A WONDERFUL WOMAN SHE

485
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
WAS.
>> Reporter: SHE WAS QUITE A BIT

486
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
YOUNGER THAN HER HUSBAND GEORGE,

487
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED TEN YEARS

488
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
AGO, GEORGE WAS MARRYING HIS

489
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
BOSS.
>> SHE WAS AN ASSISTANT

490
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
PRINCIPAL AT OUR SCHOOL, AND I

491
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
WAS A 7th GRADE MATH TEACHER AT

492
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
THAT TIME.

493
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
AND I JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH

494
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
HER.

495
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
>> GEORGE MADE THE BIG DECISION,

496
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
THE TIME HAD COME TO PROPOSE.

497
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
>> SHE TURNED ME DOWN FIVE

498
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
TIMES.

499
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
>> YOU ASKED HER TO MARRY YOU,

500
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
BUT SHE TURNED YOU DOWN?

501
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
>> FIVE TIMES.

502
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE SIXTH TIME?

503
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
>> THE SIXTH TIME I WAITED UNTIL

504
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
IT WAS NOT SUCH ROUGH SAILING.

505
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
WE GOT MARRIED ON THE SWOOP OUT

506
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
OF MYSTIC.

507
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
BETH, AMY AND ANN ARE GEORGE'S

508
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
DAUGHTERS FROM HIS FIRST

509
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
MARRIAGE.

510
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
ERICA IS DAWN'S DAUGHTER FROM

511
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
HER FIRST MARRIAGE.

512
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
HER OTHER DAUGHTER WAS OUT WHILE

513
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
WE WERE AT THE HOUSE.

514
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
THEY'RE A BLENDED BUT VERY CLOSE

515
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
FAMILY WITH 11 GRANDCHILDREN.

516
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
>> WE BUILT THIS BEAUTIFUL HOUSE

517
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
IN THE ADIRONDACKS, THE DREAM

518
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
WAS -- IT WAS GOING TO BE DAWN'S

519
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
HOUSE, BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO

520
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
DIE.

521
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'M MUCH OLDER THAN DAWN.

522
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
IT WAS GOING TO BE HER HOUSE AND

523
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN

524
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
COULD USE THE HOUSE ON THE LAKE.

525
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
THERE WOULD BE ROOMS DOWN STAIRS

526
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
FOR KIDS.

527
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
IT WAS GOING TO BE DAWN'S HOUSE

528
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
ULTIMATELY WITH ALL THE

529
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
CHILDREN.

530
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
ALL THE CHILDREN.

531
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
AND NOW IT'S ME.

532
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I CAN'T -- I DON'T THINK I CAN

533
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
DO THAT.

534
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
>> I WANT TO REITERATE TO YOU,

535
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
GEORGE, HAVE YOU THESE BEAUTIFUL

536
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
DAUGHTERS AND SON IN LAWS AND

537
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
GRANDCHILDREN, AND EVERYONE WILL

538
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
BE HERE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU, IS

539
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
THAT RIGHT, LADIES?

540
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
>> MY JOB HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO

541
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
TAKE CARE OF OTHER PEOPLE?

542
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT IF SOME PEOPLE

543
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
TAKE CARE OF YOU FOR A WHILE?

544
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
>> NO ONE TAKES CARE OF ME.

545
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
>> STOP BEING SO STUBBORN.

546
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
>> IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY

547
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
FRIDAY, THIS IS HOW GEORGE FOUND

548
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

549
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
>> ONE OF THE KIDS CAME UP WITH

550
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
A COMPUTER AND SAID, SOMETHING'S

551
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
HAPPENING AT SANDY HOOK SCHOOL

552
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
AND YOUR WIFE'S BEEN KILLED.

553
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
>> GEORGE RACED OUT OF SCHOOL

554
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
AND INTO A NIGHTMARE, LIKE ALL

555
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
THE FAMILIES OF VICTIMS THEYEN

556
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
WATT TO KNOW MORE.

557
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
AND ON THIS DAY THEY HAVE

558
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
LEARNED MORE.

559
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
TWO TEACHERS WHO SURVIVED SAID

560
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
THEY WERE HAVING A MEETING WITH

561
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
DAWN WHEN THE SHOTS RANG OUT.

562
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
>> SHE PUT HERSELF IN JEOPARDY,

563
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
AND I HAVE BEEN ANGRY ABOUT THAT

564
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
UNTIL THE TWO WOMEN I MET TODAY,

565
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
SHE TOLD THEM TO RUN TO SHELTER

566
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
WHEN SHE CONFRONTED THE GUNMAN.

567
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
SHE COULD HAVE AVOIDED THAT.

568
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
SHE COULDN'T, I KNEW SHE

569
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
WOULDN'T.
I'M NOT ANGRY ANY MORE.

570
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'M NOT ANGRY, I'M JUST VERY

571
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
SAD.
THEY SAID, WE WERE AT THE

572
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
MEETING, THERE WERE GUNSHOTS.

573
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
SOMEBODY SHOT THE WINDOW,

574
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
SOMEBODY CAME IN, INTO THE --

575
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
NOT INTO THE OFFICE, BUT INTO

576
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
THE BUILDING, THE FOYER OF THE

577
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
BUILDING.
DAWN TOLD US TO GO HIDE, AND SHE

578
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
AND AT LEAST ONE OTHER TEACHER

579
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
RAN OUT AND ACTUALLY TRIED TO

580
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
SUBDUE THE KILLER.

581
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT COMES

582
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
FROM, DAWN WAS ALL OF 5'2".

583
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
>> EVERYONE HERE IS PROUD, NO

584
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
ONE MORE SO THAN ERICA, WHO SAID

585
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
HER MOM WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR HER

586
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
DAUGHTERS.
>> EVERY GAME, PRACTICE, SHE WAS

587
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
THERE.
DANCE COMPETITION, SHE WAS DOING

588
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
HOMEWORK ON THE BLEACHERS, BUT

589
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
SHE WAS THERE.

590
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
AND SHE WAS MY ROCK, MY ROCK.

591
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
>> AND NOW SHE IS A HERO TOO.

592
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
>> THE FINAL THING I WANT TO ASK

593
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
YOU IS, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO

594
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
YOUR MOM RIGHT NOW?

595
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
>> COME BACK.

596
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
JUST COME BACK.

597
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
>> GARY TUCHMAN JOINS ME NOW

598
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
LIVE.
I GUESS SOME PEOPLE DON'T

599
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WOULD TALK

600
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

601
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
WHAT I FOUND IS OFTEN TIMES

602
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
PEOPLE WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT

603
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
THEIR LOVED ONE.

604
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT THE LIFE

605
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
THEY LIVED, NOT JUST HOW THEIR

606
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
LIFE ENDED.

607
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT, ANDERSON.

608
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
AND THEY ARE SUCH A WONDERFUL

609
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
AND AMAZING FAMILY.

610
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
WE'RE SO GRATEFUL THEY LET US

611
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
INTO THEIR HOME ON ADAY LIKE

612
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
THIS.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO

613
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
STAY CLOSE AND STAY UNITED.

614
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
THAT'S WHAT WILL GIVE THEM

615
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
STRENGTH.
OF THE FIVE DAUGHTERS, TWO OF

616
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000

TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME TO GIVE

621
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
THEIR FATHER GEORGE STRENGTH.

622
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
THEY HAVE A HAPPY EVENT COMING

623
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000

624
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
SHE'S GETTING MARRIED IN JULY.

625
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THEY ALL BELIEVE THAT THEIR

626
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
MOTHER'S SPIRIT WILL BE THERE

627
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
ANDERSON?

630
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

631
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER AT SANDY

632
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

633
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
SHE JOINS ME LIVE.

634
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I SPOKE TO YOU ON THE PHONE

635
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
FRIDAY.
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU ALL

636
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
WEEKEND.
I THINK HEROES ARE TEACHERS

637
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
EVERY DAY AROUND THE COUNTRY.

638
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I FIND -- I JUST THINK WHAT YOU

639
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
DID WAS SO HEROIC.

640
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
YOU -- EXPLAIN AGAIN, YOU

641
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
HEARD -- YOU KNEW SOMETHING WAS

642
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
GOING WRONG.

643
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
HOW?
>> WELL, I MEAN WE WERE IN OUR

644
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
CLASSROOM, WE HEARD WHAT SOUNDED

645
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
LIKE GUNSHOTS, NOISES.

646
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
>> YOU HEARD THAT --

647
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
>> WELL, THERE WAS A LOUD

648
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
SPEAKER, THE PA SYSTEM WAS NOT

649
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
WORKING IN THE WAY IT NORMALLY

650
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
IS, YOU DON'T USUALLY HEAR

651
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
THINGS UNLESS SOMEONE MAKES AN

652
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
ANNOUNCEMENT.
THERE WERE NOISES THAT DIDN'T

653
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
SOUND CORRECT.

654
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
THERE WAS NO ONE TELLING US IT

655
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
WAS A DRILL.

656
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
WE TOOK THE CHILDREN AND WENT

657
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
INTO A LOCKDOWN, WE GO TO A

658
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
CERTAIN PLACE IN THE ROOM.

659
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
WE PULL THE BLINDS DOWN, WE LOCK

660
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
THE CLASSROOM DOORS AND WE COVER

661
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
THE WINDOW AT THE DOOR.

662
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
>> THIS IS SOMETHING YOU HAD

663
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
PRACTICED.
>> ABOUT A MONTH OR SO BEFORE,

664
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
DAWN MAKES SURE WE DO THAT.

665
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
AND WE GO TO A SAFE PLACE AND

666
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
TYPICALLY WHEN IT'S A DRILL THEY

667
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
TELL US, OKAY, AND WE EVEN EXIT

668
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
THE BUILDING FOLLOWING A CERTAIN

669
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
PATH.
IF THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY WE

670
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
WOULD GO DOWN TO THE SANDY HOOK

671
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
FIREHOUSE AND GATHER THERE,

672
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
WHICH IS WHAT WE DID THAT DAY.

673
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
WE KNEW THAT --
>> BUT YOU SAT THE KIDS DOWN.

674
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
>> WE SAT IN THE CUBBY AREA,

675
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
AWAY FROM THE DOOR SO NO ONE

676
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
COULD SEE US, READ THEM A STORY,

677
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
TALKED TO THEM.

678
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
THEY KEPT SAYING HOW COME WE'RE

679
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
HERE FOR SO LONG.

680
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
WELL, IT WILL BE A LITTLE

681
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
LONGER.
WHEN THEY'RE FIVE YOU DO

682
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
WHATEVER YOU CAN TO KEEP THEM

683
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
SAFE AND CALM.

684
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
>> THE COURAGE FOR YOU TO BE

685
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
ABLE TO JUST SIT THERE AND READ

686
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
A STORY AND KEEP THEM CALM.

687
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
>> I THINK THE ADRENALINE KICKS

688
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
IN AND YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO

689
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
DO.

690
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
THERE WERE TWO OTHER PEOPLE IN

691
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
THE ROOM THAT WERE HELPING ME

692
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
WITH PULLING DOWN THE BLINDS AND

693
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
THAT, I WAS FOCUSED ON THE KIDS.

694
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
AND JUST KEEPING THEM SAFE.

695
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'M NOT ABOUT TO TELL THEM THAT

696
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I THINK SOMETHING IS VERY BAD OR

697
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
VERY WRONG.

698
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
WE WAITED AND WAITED.

699
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
IT SEEMED LIKE A VERY LONG TIME.

700
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
MAYBE IT WAS 20 MINUTES A HALF

701
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
HOUR, I'M NOT SURE.
THERE WERE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR.

702
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
IT WAS POLICE, SOMEONE TELLING

703
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
US THAT WE HAD TO LEAVE.

704
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
DIDN'T WANT TO OPEN THE DOOR AT

705
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
FIRST, BUT WE DID.

706
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
THEY SAID, HAVE THE CHILDREN

707
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
WALK HOLD HANDS, COVER THEIR

708
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
EYES IF THEY COULD -- HE DIDN'T

709
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
SAY WHY, HE JUST SAID HAVE THEM

710
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
DO IT.

711
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
AT 5 IT'S NOT SO EASY TO CLOSE

712
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
YOUR EYES AND WALK.

713
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
SO I HAD THEM LOOK TOWARD THE

714
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
WALL.
I SAID, REMEMBER THE ADVENTURE

715
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
WE HAD.

716
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AGAIN.

717
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
>> HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

718
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
>> AGAIN, ADRENALINE.

719
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
YOU ARE MOVING, YOU KNOW YOU

720
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
HAVE TO GET TO SAFETY.

721
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION

722
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
WAS OCCURRING, WE DIDN'T HAVE

723
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
ANY INFORMATION.
>> HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP NOW?

724
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
>> HOW AM I HOLDING UP NOW?

725
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
>> YOU KNEW SOME OF THE KIDS?

726
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
>> TEN OF THEM.

727
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
TEN OF THEM WERE IN MY CLASS

728
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
LAST YEAR.

729
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I WANT TO ATTEND SOME OF THE

730
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
SERVICES, I'M SURE SOME FAMILIES

731
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
WANT PRIVACY.

732
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
THERE'S A FEW CHILDREN WHO I'VE

733
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
HAD NOT JUST THEM, I'VE HAD

734
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
THEIR SIBLINGS AND IN ONE CASE,

735
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000

00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
HAPPEN AGAIN, EVEN IF YOU CAN

920
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
SAVE A FEW LIVES.

921
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
OBVIOUSLY WHAT HE'S REFERRING TO

922
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
IS LEGISLATION DEALING WITH GUN

923
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
CONTROL.
>> AND ALSO MENTAL HEALTH

924
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
ISSUES.

925
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

926
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
THINGS YOU CAN POTENTIALLY DO.

927
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
THERE WILL BE A POLITICAL FIGHT.

928
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
OBVIOUSLY THE HOUSE OF

929
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
REPRESENTATIVES IN THE SENATE,

930
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES.

931
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
HE DID MAKE THAT COMMITMENT, HE

932
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
PROMISED HE WAS GOING TO DO, AND

933
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I THINK MAYOR BLOOMBERG OF NEW

934
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
YORK WANTS HIM TO DO, NOT JUST

935
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
TALK A LITTLE BIT, BUT START

936
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
TAKING ACTION.
>> IT'S SOMETHING HE HAD TALKED

937
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
ABOUT BEFORE BECOMING PRESIDENT.

938
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
>> HE DIDN'T JUST HAVE PROBLEMS

939
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
WITH REPUBLICANS WHO ARE OPPOSED

940
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
TO STRICTER GUN CONTROL.

941
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
THERE ARE PLENTY OF DEMOCRATS

942
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
OUT THERE, THEY THINK IT'S SUCH

943
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
A LOSING ISSUE.

944
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
HE HAS A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES, HE

945
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
HAS A FISCAL CLIFF.

946
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I THINK HE'S GOING TO DEAL WITH

947
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
THIS -- YOU KNOW, HE'S IN HIS

948
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
SECOND TERM, HE DOESN'T THE HAVE

949
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING

950
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
RE-ELECTED.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'LL SUCCEED.

951
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I'VE BEEN IN WASHINGTON A LONG

952
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
TIME, GUN CONTROL IS AN ISSUE.

953
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I THINK HE'S GOING TO TRY.

954
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
>> A CRIME LIKE THIS HAS SHOCKED

955
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
THE NATION.

956
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
WHETHER IT LEADS TO CHANGE,

957
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE.

958
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
ON THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

959
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
YOU AND SANJAY WERE TALKING

960
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
ABOUT THIS EARLIER, MENTAL

961
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
HEALTH IS ODDLY DEALT WITH IN

962
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
THIS COUNTRY.

963
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
IT'S NOT DEALT WITH OR

964
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
CONSIDERED IN THE SAME WAY AS A

965
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
DISEASE LIKE CANCER.

966
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
>> TIPPER GORE, REMEMBER TIPPER

967
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
GORE, SHE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE,

968
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
AND TRIED TO BRING IT TO THE

969
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
FOREFRONT BUT IT'S SORT OF GONE

970
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
AWAY.
GUN CONTROL IS IMPORTANT, BUT

971
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
MENTAL HEALTH, DEALING WITH

972
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
THIS, AND TAKING IT OUT OF THE

973
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
BACK ROWS AND DEALING WITH IT,

974
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
IF A LOVED ONE SEES A YOUNG KID

975
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
WHO HAS SOME PROBLEMS, NOT JUST

976
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
PRETEND THEY DON'T EXIST, THERE

977
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
ARE MEDICAL TREATMENTS.

978
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
>> AND ALSO OFTEN TIMES PARENTS

979
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
CAN'T GET HELP UNLESS THE CHILD

980
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
CAN BE PROVEN TO BE A DANGER TO

981
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
THEMSELVES OR OTHERS.

982
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
AND THAT OFTEN WAITS UNTIL A

983
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
CRIME IS COMMITTED.

984
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
>> AND WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH

985
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
ABOUT THE SHOOTER IN THIS CASE,

986
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF

987
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
INDIVIDUALS THIS INDIVIDUAL MAY

988
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
OR MAY NOT HAVE HAD.

989
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF

990
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
TREATMENT HE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE

991
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
HAD.
I SUSPECT WE'RE GOING TO LEARN A

992
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
LOT MORE.

993
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
>>> VICTORIA SOTO IS BEING

994
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
REMEMBERED AS A HERO AS WELL.

995
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
SHE DIED FRIDAY MORNING TRYING

996
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
TO PROTECT HER FIRST GRADE

997
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
STUDENTS.

998
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
JUST HEAD YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR

999
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
FROM NICOLE AND STEVEN WHOSE

1000
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
DAUGHTER WAS IN THE CLASSROOM

1001
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
ACROSS THE HALL.

1002
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
THEIR DAUGHTER WHO SURVIVED AND

1003
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
IS OKAY.

1004
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
WAS A STUDENT OF VICTORIA SOTO'S

1005
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
LAST YEAR.
THEY BELIEVE SHE'S ALIVE TONIGHT

1006
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
BECAUSE OF VICTORIA SOTO.
This holiday, Share Everything.

1007
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Share "Not even close."

1008
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Share "You owe me..."

1009
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000

1016
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH OF
OUR GREAT STATES FOLKS VISIT.

1017
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
MISSISSIPPI,

1018
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
ALABAMA,

1019
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
LOUISIANA

1020
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
OR FLORIDA,

1021
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
THEY'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

1022
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
SHAUL, YOUR ALABAMA
HOSPITALITY IS INCREDIBLE.

1023
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
THANKS, KAREN.

1024
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
LOVE YOUR MISSISSIPPI OUTDOORS.

1025
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I VOTE FOR YOUR
FLORIDA BEACHES, DAWN.

1026
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
BILL, THIS LOUISIANA
SEAFOOD IS DELICIOUS.

1027
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
WE'RE HAVING SUCH A
GREAT YEAR ON THE GULF,

1028
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
WE'VE DECIDED TO PUT
ASIDE OUR RIVALRY.

1029
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME TO
VISIT ANYONE OF OUR STATES.

1030
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
THE BEACHES AND WATERS
COULDN'T BE MORE BEAUTIFUL.

1031
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
TAKE A BOAT RIDE, GO FISHING
OR JUST LAY IN THE SUN.

1032
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
WE'VE GOT COASTLINE TO EXPLORE
AND WILDLIFE TO PHOTOGRAPH.

1033
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
AND THERE'S WORLD CLASS DINING
WITH OUR WORLD FAMOUS SEAFOOD.

1034
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
SO FOR A GREAT VACATION
THIS YEAR, COME TO THE GULF.

1035
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
ITS ALL FABULOUS BUT
I GIVE FLORIDA THE EDGE.

1036
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
RIGHT AFTER MISSISSIPPI.

1037
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
YOU MEAN ALABAMA.

1038
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
SAY LOUISIANOR
THERE'S NO DESSERT.

1039
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
THIS INVITATION IS
BROUGHT TO YOU BY BP

1040
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
AND ALL OF US WHO
CALL THE GULF HOME.

1041
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
>>> IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER
THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN

1042
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
INSIDE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

1043
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
SCHOOL FRIDAY MORNING.

1044
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
THEIR PARENTS RACED TO THE SCENE

1045
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
DESPERATE TO FIND THEIR SONS AND

1046
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
DAUGHTERS.

1047
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
NICOLE AND STEVEN MADDOX LIVED

1048
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
THROUGH THAT PANIC.

1049
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
THEIR DAUGHTER JORDAN IS A

1050
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
SECOND GRADER, THANKFULLY THEY

1051
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
FOUND HER SAFE.

1052
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
HER CLASSROOM WAS JUST ACROSS

1053
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
THE HALL FROM VICTORIA SOTO'S

1054
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM.

1055
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
VICTORIA SOTO DIED TRYING TO

1056
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
SAVE HER STUDENTS.

1057
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
SHE IS 27 YEARS OLD AND IS BEING

1058
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
REMEMBERED TONIGHT AS A HERO.

1059
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I SPOKE A SHORT TIME AGO TO

1060
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
NICOLE AND STEVEN MADDOX.

1061
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
>> HOW ARE YOU GUYS HOLDING UP,

1062
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
HOW IS JORDAN HOLDING UP?

1063
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
>> I THINK WE'RE DOING OKAY.

1064
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO

1065
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
PROCESS EVERYTHING.

1066
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
WE'RE TRYING TO BE THERE FOR

1067
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
HER, AND SUPPORT HER, AND HELP

1068
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
HER TO DEAL WITH THIS IN HER OWN

1069
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
WAY AND OWN TIME.

1070
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
SHE'S DOING OKAY, IT'S JUST THE

1071
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
NIGHTTIME I THINK IS WHEN SHE

1072
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
REALLY STARTS TO REFLECT ON

1073
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

1074
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
>> THERE'S SO MANY PARENTS

1075
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
AROUND, NOT ONLY THIS TOWN, BUT

1076
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE TRYING

1077
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TALK TO

1078
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
THEIR KIDS ABOUT IT, HOW DO

1079
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
YOU -- DO YOU WAIT FOR JORDAN TO

1080
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
SAY SOMETHING TO YOU?
HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH IT?

1081
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
>> I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHAT

1082
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
WE'VE BEEN DOING.

1083
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
JUST BECAUSE WHO KNOWS HOW TO

1084
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
DEAL WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1085
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
AS THINGS COME UP, SHE ASKS

1086
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
QUESTIONS, YOU ANSWER THEM

1087
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
CALMLY.

1088
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
WHAT HAS --

1089
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
>> WHAT DID SHE SEE, DO YOU

1090
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
KNOW?
>> OR HEAR?

1091
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
>> WE'VE BEEN GETTING THE STORY

1092
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
SLOWLY FROM HER.

1093
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
THE FIRST TIME SHE TOLD US THE

1094
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
STORY, SHE TOLD US ABOUT HEARING

1095
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
THE GUNSHOTS.

1096
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
HER CLASSROOM IS RIGHT BEHIND

1097
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE AND THE

1098
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
CONFERENCE ROOM THAT I

1099
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE FOLKS

1100
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
WERE IN.
>> SHE WAS RIGHT ACROSS THE HALL

1101
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
FROM VICTORIA SOTO'S CLASS?

1102
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
>> WHICH IS SOMETHING SHE WAS

1103
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
EXCITED ABOUT, SHE WOULD BE

1104
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
GOING JUST ACROSS THE HALL FROM

1105
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
HER FAVORITE TEACHER.

1106
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
THEY SPOKE ALMOST DAILY.

1107
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
AND THAT WAS THE HARDEST THING

1108
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
TO HAVE TO TELL HER.

1109
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
THAT'S WHEN SHE REALLY BROKE

1110
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
DOWN.
SHE HAD BEEN HANDLING MOST OF IT

1111
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
OKAY, BUT WHEN WE TOLD HER ABOUT

1112
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
MISS SOTO THAT'S WHEN SHE TOOK

1113
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
IT THE HARDEST.

1114
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
>> SHE KNOWS SHE'S DEAD?

1115
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
>> SHE KNOWS NOW.

1116
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
WE WAITED.

1117
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
WE TOLD HER SATURDAY MORNING.

1118
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
>> HOW DO YOU SAY THAT TO A

1119
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
6-YEAR-OLD?
>> WE JUST EXPLAINED TO HER, YOU

1120
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

1121
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
AND HONESTLY SHE SAW ENOUGH TO

1122
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WERE

1123
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T WALK OUT OF

1124
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
THERE ALIVE.

1125
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
>> SHE SAW SOMEBODY LAYING

1126
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
THERE?
>> SHE SAW THE PRINCIPAL, YEAH.

1127
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
THEY HAD TO WALK THE CHILDREN

1128
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
OUT THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR WHERE

1129
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
HER CLASSROOM IS LOCATED.

1130
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
SHE WALKED PAST THE BODY.

1131
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
ALTHOUGH THEY TOLD THEM TO CLOSE

1132
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
THEIR EYES, I THINK SOME OF THEM

1133
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
WERE KIND OF PEEKING AS KIDS

1134
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
HAVE A TENDENCY TO DO.

1135
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
>> SHE SAW THE PRINCIPAL ON THE

1136
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
FLOOR?

1137
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
>> SHE SAW THE PRINCIPAL, SHE

1138
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
SAW BLOOD, SHE TOLD US ABOUT A

1139
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
LOT OF BROKEN GLASS.

1140
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
>> SO WHEN YOU ACTUALLY TOLD HER

1141
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
THAT HER FORMER TEACHER HAD

1142
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
DIED, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

1143
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
>> UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S VERY

1144
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
SIMPLE.
IT'S -- WE CALM SAID, JORDAN,

1145
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
SHE WAS ONE OF THE TEACHERS WHO

1146
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
PASSED AWAY.

1147
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
SHE HAD A MOMENT WHERE SHE

1148
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
PAUSED AND HER EYES GOT REAL

1149
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
WIDE, AND SHE JUST -- YOU COULD

1150
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
SEE HER HEART SINK.

1151
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
AND --
>> DOES A 6-YEAR-OLD KNOW -- I

1152
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
MEAN, MY DAD DIED WHEN I WAS 10.

1153
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I'M NOT SURE LOOKING BACK ON IT,

1154
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
THAT I UNDERSTOOD FULLY WHAT

1155
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
THAT MEANT AT THE TIME.

1156
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
>> I THINK CHILDREN ARE

1157
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
RESILIENT AND THEY CAN HEAR THE

1158
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
COLD HARD TRUTH OF SOMETHING AND

1159
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
TAKE THAT IN.

1160
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
IT MAY TAKE YEARS TO PROCESS,

1161
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
BUT MY ADVICE TO PARENTS IS

1162
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
DON'T TRY TO COVER IT UP OR --

1163
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
WHEN DEATH HAPPENS OR HORRIBLE

1164
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
THINGS HAPPEN, YOU HAVE TO FIND

1165
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
A WAY TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOUR

1166
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
CHILDREN.
IN A LOT OF WAYS, IT'S LIFE.

1167
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
THIS IS THE WORLD WE LIVE IN.

1168
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
AND THERE'S EVIL AND HIDING THAT

1169
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
DOES NOT HELP THEM AT ALL.

1170
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
>> SHE MUST HAVE -- I THINK THE

1171
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
ULTIMATE REALITY -- SHE LOOKED

1172
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
AT US AND SAID, WHO AM I GOING

1173
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
TO TALK TO EVERY DAY?

1174
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I SAID THERE ARE OTHER TEACHERS

1175
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
YOU CAN TALK TO.

1176
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
SHE SAID YEAH, BUT SHE WAS

1177
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
REALLY FUNNY.

1178
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
>> WHAT WAS IT ABOUT HER?

1179
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
>> SHE WAS A KIND INDIVIDUAL,

1180
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
YOU CAN TELL SHE HAD A HEART FOR

1181
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
HER CHILDREN, EACH AND EVERY ONE

1182
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
OF THEM.

1183
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
SHE MEANT BUSINESS, WHICH WE

1184
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
LOVED.

1185
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
>> SHE WAS YOUTHFUL.

1186
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
OUR FIRST TEACHER CONFERENCE I

1187
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
FELT LIKE AN OLD MAN.

1188
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
SHE SEEMED BARELY OUT OF HIGH

1189
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
SCHOOL HERSELF.

1190
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
IT'S JUST A TESTAMENT TO HER

1191
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
PERSONALITY.

1192
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
>> VERY MATURE.

1193
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
SHE WAS A GREAT TEACHER AND SHE

1194
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
PUT EVERYTHING INTO WHAT SHE

1195
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
DID.
THE KIDS ENJOYED LEARNING.

1196
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
THERE WASN'T A DAY THAT JORDAN

1197
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
SAID I DON'T WANT TO GO TO

1198
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
SCHOOL.
THERE WERE TIMES IT SEEMED LIKE

1199
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
AFTER A WEEKEND SHE WAS EXCITED

1200
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
TO GO BACK.

1201
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
THAT TOLD US SHE HAD A REALLY

1202
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
GOOD TEACHER.

1203
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
SOMEBODY WHO WAS DOING THEIR JOB

1204
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
AND DOING IT WELL.
>> THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US.

1205
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY, I

1206
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
APPRECIATE IT.

1207
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
>> THANK YOU.

1208
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
>> I WISH YOU PEACE IN THE DAYS

1209
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000

>> THANK YOU.

1210
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
>>> COMING UP, YOU'RE GOING TO

1211
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000

00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
THAT COULD LIGHT UP THE ROOM.

1256
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING KIND TO

1257

SAY ABOUT ANYBODY.

00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
CHILDREN SURVIVED THE SHOOTING,

1275
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
WENT TO SUNDAY SCHOOL JUST LIKE

1276
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
THEY DID EVERY WEEK, IT SOUNDS

1277
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
LIKE A SIMPLE THING, WASN'T

1278
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
SIMPLE OR EASY FOR ANYONE.

1279
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
NOT FOR THE CHILDREN OR THEIR

1280
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
TEACHER.

1281
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
>> Reporter: THIS IS WHERE SOME

1282
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
OF THE CHILDREN WHO WERE KILLED

1283
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY PRAYED

1284
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
AND WENT TO SUNDAY SCHOOL.

1285
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
SHE WAS BACK ON THIS SUNDAY FOR

1286
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
ALL HER STUDENTS, INCLUDING

1287
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
THOSE WHO SURVIVED.

1288
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
>> YOU HAD A LOT OF CHILDREN

1289
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
HERE IN THIS ROOM, WHAT WAS THAT

1290
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
LIKE FOR YOU.

1291
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
>> IT WAS A LITTLE BIT -- IT WAS

1292
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
VERY SCARY, BECAUSE I SPENT

1293
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
YESTERDAY TRYING TO PREPARE FOR

1294
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
TODAY.
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING

1295
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
TO HAPPEN.

1296
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
AND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE A CHILD

1297
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
RAISED THEIR HAND.

1298
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I SAID YES, AND THEY SAID, MY

1299
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
FRIENDS DIED.

1300
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
LATER ON WHEN WE GOT TO THE

1301
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
POINT WHERE WE PRAYED, PRETTY

1302
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
MUCH EVERY CHILD IN HERE HAD A

1303
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
PRAYER, AND MANY OF THEM WERE MY

1304
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
FRIEND JACK DIED, MY FRIEND BEN

1305
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
DIED, MY FRIEND CHARLOTTE DIED.

1306
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
WE PRAYED, WE PROBABLY PRAYED

1307
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
MORE THAN WE'VE EVER PRAYED

1308
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
BEFORE.

1309
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
>> SHE KNEW THERE WOULD BE

1310
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
ANXIETY AMONG THE CHILDREN AND

1311
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
THEIR PARENTS.

1312
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
SHE SAW BOTH.

1313
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
>> WE WERE A LITTLE WORRIED.

1314
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
WE HAD KIDS WHOSE PARENTS SAID

1315
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO COME TO

1316
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
CLASS.
IT'S LIKE A SCHOOL AND THEY WERE

1317
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
WORRIED.

1318
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
ONE GIRL DIDN'T WANT TO COME

1319
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
BECAUSE BEN WOULDN'T BE THERE.

1320
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
THERE WAS A LOT OF ANXIETY.

1321
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
BEN WOULD HAVE BEEN SITTING

1322
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
RIGHT HERE ON THIS CARPET WITH

1323
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
ME.
SO WHEN THE KIDS BRING IT UP

1324
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
THAT MY FRIEND BEN DIED, I HAD

1325
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
TO DO THE ATTENDANCE, WE HAVE

1326
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
ATTENDANCE SIGN IN PAGES FOR THE

1327
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
PARENTS.
THEY HAVE TO SIGN THEM IN AND

1328
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
OUT.
AS I WAS PUTTING THEM IN THE BOX

1329
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
LAST NIGHT, THE FIRST GRADE PAGE

1330
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
HAD BEN'S NAME ON IT.

1331
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I THOUGHT, THIS IS GOING TO BE

1332
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,000
HANGING ON THE HALL WALL WITH

1333
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
HIS NAME ON IT, AND HE WOULDN'T

1334
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
BE SIGNED IN.

1335
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
SO I PRINTED IT WITH HIS NAME

1336
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
OFF.
AND WHEN I TALKED TO THE PASTOR

1337
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
ABOUT IT, IT REALLY HIT ME, I

1338
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
ERASED HIS NAME.

1339
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
>> THIS ONE SAYS CHARLOTTE IS

1340
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
SAFE.
>> YES.

1341
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
THAT WAS FOR CHARLOTTE WHO WENT

1342
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
HERE.
>> CHARLOTTE WAS 6 YEARS OLD.

1343
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
ANOTHER CARD READS IN PART

1344
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

1345
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
VOGELMAN SAYS SHE FELT PRIDE, A

1346
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
STRENGTH SHE SAW IN HER SUNDAY

1347
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
SCHOOL CHILDREN.
>> I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH KIDS

1348
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
MY WHOLE ADULT LIFE.

1349
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
THEY'RE MY KIDS, THEY'RE MY

1350
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
KIDS.
PEOPLE ON FACEBOOK ARE LIKE, I'M

1351
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
SO GLAD YOUR KIDS ARE OKAY.

1352
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I'M OFFYOUSLY VERY KIDS THAT MY

1353
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
KIDS ARE NOT OKAY, BUT MY KIDS

1354
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
ARE NOT OKAY, MY KIDS DIED,

1355
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
THAT'S HOW EVERYONE FEELS IN

1356
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,000
NEWTOWN.

1357
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
SORRY.

1358
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
THEY'RE BABYIES.

1359
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
>> I MEAN, FACED WITH THAT

1360
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
HORRIBLE DILEMMA WHETHER TO TAKE

1361
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
THE CHILD'S NAME OFF THE BOARD,

1362
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
HOW IS SHE DOING THROUGH ALL

1363
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
THIS.
>> TAKING THAT NAME DOWN, THAT'S

1364
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
BEEN THE MOMENT FOR HER.

1365
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
EVERYONE'S HAD A MOMENT.

1366
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
THE WAY SHE'S GETTING THROUGH IT

1367
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
IS STRANGELY ENOUGH THE CHILDREN

1368
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
THEMSELVES, THEIR HONESTY, THEY

1369
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
KNOW THEY HAVE TO BE STRONG FOR

1370
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
THESE CHILDREN.

1371
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
RECEIVING ALL THESE KIND WORDS

1372
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
FROM PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD,

1373
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
THAT'S BEEN A SOURCE OF

1374
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
ENCOURAGEMENT.

1375
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
SHE WAS WONDERING WHAT SHE WAS

1376
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
GOING TO DO FOR THE LESSON

1377
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
TODAY, WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY

1378
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
TO THESE CHILDREN.

1379
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
SHE GOT A KIND LETTER FROM

1380
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
SOMEONE FROM LITTLETON COLORADO,

1381
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
FROM THE CLERGY THERE, THEY

1382
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN THROUGH A

1383
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
LOT.
ONLY WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH

1384
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
IT, CAN YOU OFFER THE ADVICE TO

1385
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
GET THROUGH IT THIS TIME.

1386
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
>> HOPEFULLY HER FAITH IS

1387
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
GETTING HER THROUGH AS WELL.

1388
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
REMARKABLE.
>>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1389
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
THERE'S A HEALTH COMPANY THAT
CAN HELP YOU STAY THAT WAY.

1390
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
WHAT'S HEALTHIER THAN THAT?
