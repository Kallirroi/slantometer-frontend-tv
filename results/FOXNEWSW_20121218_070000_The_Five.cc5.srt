00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
>> I THINK IT WAS EXACTLY THE

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
RIGHT THING TO DO.

189
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I AGREE WITH ERIC.

190
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
THE OTHER VICTIMS HERE ARE THE

191
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
OTHER KIDS IN THAT SCHOOL WHO

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
WITNESSED ALL OF THIS AND ARE

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
GOING TO HAVE YEARS OF TRAUMA IN

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
FRONT OF THEM.

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE A

196
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
DIFFICULT TIME UNDERSTANDING IS

197
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
WHY THEY NEED TO BE INTERVIEWED

198
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
AT THAT AGE.

199
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
AUTHORITIES THINK THAT THEY DO.

200
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN

201
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
TOO FAR TOO MANY OF THESE IN HIS

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
FOUR YEARS IN OFFICE.
I THINK HE DID A GOOD JOB.

203
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
FOR THAT TOWN I CAN'T IMAGE.

204
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
IT IS UNIMAGINABLE BEING A

205
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
FATHERMENT YOUR GREATEST NICE

206
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
MARE IS TO HAVE POLICE KNOCK ON

207
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
YOUR DOOR AND SAY YOUR KID

208
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
SCRATCHED HIS CAR OR SOMETHING

209
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
LIKE THAT, 20 KIDS.

210
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
>> AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH

211
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
WORSE.

212
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
AS BILL WAS SAYING, KIMBERLY,

213
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WANTED TO

214
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
POINT OUT WAS THE HEROISM.

215
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE SOUND

216
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
BITE YOU CHOOSE.

217
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
>> TOLD ME GOOD MORNING AND

218
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

219
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I SAID I WAS DOING WELL.

220
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
SHE SAID SHE LOVED ME I GAVE HER

221
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
A KISS AND I WAS OUT THE DOOR.

222
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
MY DAUGHTER EMILY WOULD BE ONE

223
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE STANDING

224
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
AND GIVING HER LOVE AND SUPPORT

225
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
TO ALL OF THOSE VICTIMS, BECAUSE

226
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
THAT'S THE TYPE OF PERSON SHE

227
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
IS.

228
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
>> KIMBERLY, I CAN IMAGE HOW

229
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
HARD IT WAS AS A PARENT OF A

230
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
6-YEAR-OLD.

231
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
TELL US YOUR THOUGHTS.

232
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
>> TAKING MY LITTLE BOY TO

233
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
SCHOOL EVERY DAY, HE'S SO YOUNG

234
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I STILL CALL HIM MY BABY BECAUSE

235
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
CHILDREN ARE SO INNOCENT THEY

236
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
RELY ON YOU LOOK UP TO YOU TO

237
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
KEEP THEM SAFE.
WHEN YOU DROP THEM OFF EVERY

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
DAY, BEING A PROSECUTOR AND

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
FORMER TEACHER MYSELF OF

240
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN AND

241
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
FIRST GRADE I LOOK AT HIS FACE

242
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
IT'S THE LAST TIME I AM GOING TO

243
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
SEE IT.

244
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I PRESSURE HIM SO MUCH.

245
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I MEMORIZE THE CLOTHES HE HAS ON

246
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
HIS LITTLE SHIRT HIS JACKET HIS

247
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
SHOES, HIS BACKPACK.

248
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I WANT TO HOLD THAT MOMENT SO I

249
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
DON'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED.

250
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
IMAGE THE PARENTS WHO DID THAT

251
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
ON THAT MORNING NOT KNOWING THE

252
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY THAT WOULD

253
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
HAPPEN AT THE END OF THE DAY

254
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
THAT'S THE LAST MOMENT THEY HAD

255
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

256
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
TO PICK THEM UP ON A FRIDAY AT A

257
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
TIME RIGHT BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS

258
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
IT'S UNBEARABLE.

259
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
>> JOINING US NOW TODAY WE HAVE

260
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
BRIAN KILMEADE WHICH IS GOOD.

261
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
THIS MORNING SOME OF THE STORIES

262
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
WE TOLD HERE OBVIOUSLY THE HEART

263
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
WRENCHING ONE FROM KIMBERLY YOU

264
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
TALKED A LOT ABOUT THOSE THIS

265
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
MORNING ON FOX AND FRIENDS.

266
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
WHAT STUCK OUT FOR YOU?

267
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
HOW DO YOU DECIDE TO TELL THE

268
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
STORY?
>> YOUR STORIES ARE JUST AS

269
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
IMPORTANT BUT WHAT STOOD OUT FOR

270
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
ME IS WHAT THE TEACHERS DID AND

271
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
THE PRINCIPAL DID.

272
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I UNDERSTAND NAVY SEALS ARE

273
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
TRAINED TO ACT LIKE THIS.

274
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I STILL AM IN AWE HOW THEY ACT

275
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
UNDER PRESSURE AND PUT THEIR

276
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
WELFARE ASIDE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

277
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
WHEN YOU HAVE A 27-YEAR-OLD

278
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
TEACHER WHO HAS NEVER BEEN SHOT

279
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
AT BEFORE YOU IMAGE SEEING A

280
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
BUNCH OF FIRST GRADERS HIDING IN

281
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
THE CLOSET.

282
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
A CLASS HAS BEEN WIPED OUT

283
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
ACROSS THE HALL.

284
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
THAT GUNMAN COMES INTO HER

285
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
CLASSROOM AND SHE HAS HER KIDS

286
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
HIDING IN THE CLOSET SHE TELLS

287
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
THE GUNMAN GO DOWN TO THE HALL.

288
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
WHERE ARE THE KIDS?

289
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
THE KIDS ARE DOWN IN THE

290
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
AUDITORIUM.

291
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
ALL OF A SUDDEN SIX KIDS PANIC

292
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
AND THEY RUN OUT OF THE CLOSET

293
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
AT WHICH TIME ACCORDING TO

294
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
REPORTS SHE DIVES IN FRONT OF

295
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
THOSE KIDS TAKES THEIR BULLETS.

296
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
THE KIDS ALSO LOSE THEIR LIVES.

297
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
ONE OF THOSE KIDS WAS BURIED

298
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
TODAY.
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM THE

299
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
HEROISM.
WHERE THAT COMES FROM AS A

300
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
TEACHER IS PURE INSTINCT,

301
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
FEARLESSNESS.
THE PRINCIPAL THERE'S A GUNMAN

302
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
IN THE HALL.
THEY DON'T RUN THEY RUN AT THE

303
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
GUNMAN.

304
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
>> IT'S AMAZING THE AMOUNT OF

305
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
COURAGE.
>> AWE INSPIRING.

306
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
>> ALSO SPEAKING OF THAT

307
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD I THOUGHT A

308
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
GREAT WAY TO DESCRIBE THE SCENE

309
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
FOR US.

310
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
YOU CAN IMAGE A 6-YEAR-OLD

311
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
SAYING THIS ABOUT HOW HE WAS

312
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
GOING TO HELP EVERYBODY GET OUT

313
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
OF IT.

314
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
LISTEN.

315
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
>> THERE WERE THE SCENES OF THE

316
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
SCHOOL CHILDREN HELPING ONE

317
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
ANOTHER, HOLDING EACH OTHER,

318
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
DUTIFULLY FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS

319
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
IN THE WAY THAT YOUNG CHILDREN

320
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
SOMETIMES DO.

321
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
ONE CHILD EVEN TRYING TO

322
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
ENCOURAGE A GROWN-UP BY SAYING,

323
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I KNOW KARATE SO IT'S OKAY.

324
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I WILL LEAD THE WAY OUT.

325
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
>> I LOVE THAT STORY.

326
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I THOUGHT ABOUT, ERIC, HOW WE

327
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
ALL HAD -- IF YOU HAVE A CHILD

328
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
IN YOUR LIFE OR YOU ARE FAMILIAR

329
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
WITH A 6-YEAR-OLD'S THINKING,

330
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
YOU TAKE WHAT BRIAN SAID ABOUT

331
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
COURAGE AND SOMETHING ABOUT THE

332
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
INNOCENCE OF A 6-YEAR-OLD, WHAT

333
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
DO YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THAT?

334
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
>> BRIAN SAID SOMETHING VERY

335
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
IMPORTANT.

336
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
TEACHERS AREN'T TRAINED MOST OF

337
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
THEM AREN'T TRAINED TO DO THIS.

338
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
THEY ARE NOT TRAINED TO RUN

339
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
TOWARDS THE FIRE, TOWARDS THE

340
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
BAD GUYS.
THESE TEACHERS DID.

341
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
IT STRIKES ME A LOT OF TIMES

342
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
SOME OF US ARE HARD ON TEACHERS

343
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
WE ARE TOUGH ON THEM FOR A LOT

344
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
OF REASONS.

345
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
THIS IS JUST AN AWAKENING TO A

346
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
GUY LIKE ME WHO SAYS THESE

347
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
TEACHERS ARE DOING GOD'S WORK.

348
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
THEY ARE PROTECTING OUR MOST

349
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
VALUABLE PRIZED ASSETS AND DOING

350
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
THINGS LIKE THAT.

351
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I HAVE TO THINK MOST EVERY

352
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
TEACHER IN THAT SITUATION WOULD

353
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
PROBABLY DO THE SAME THING.

354
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
>> I WANT TO GET THAT YOOUGHTS

355
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
BOB AND BRIAN.

356
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
WHAT DID YOUR KIDS ASK ABOUT

357
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
THIS WEEKEND.

358
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
THEY ARE OLDER.
>> THEY ARE OLDER.

359
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
THEY HAD A HARD TIME.

360
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
THEY SAID PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME

361
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
HOW THIS HAPPENED.

362
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE.

363
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
THEY TALK ABOUT FATE AND HOW DID

364
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
GOD LET THIS HAPPEN.

365
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I THINK THEY WERE JUST STUNNED.

366
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
THIS IS WHAT KIMBERLY SAID.

367
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
IMMEDIATELY TOOK OUT MY PHOTO

368
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
ALBUM.

369
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
SAW MY KIDS WHEN THEY WERE THIS

370
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
AGE.
I JUST -- IT IS SO UNIMAGINABLE.

371
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
BY THE WAY ERIC I GIVE YOU

372
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
CREDIT WE DO GET A PROPENSITY TO

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
GET DOWN.

374
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
THEY SHOWED ENORMOUS COURAGE.

375
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I UNDERSTAND A PARENT THROWING

376
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF BULLETS.

377
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
WE COULD DO THAT.

378
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
BUT FOR A TEACHER TO DO THAT FOR

379
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
KIDS THAT WERE NOT MER BLOHER B

380
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
REALLY IS AN EXTRAORDINARY

381
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
CIRCUMSTANCE.

382
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
>> MY OLDER SON 11TH GRADE HE

383
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
SAID IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET A

384
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF

385
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000

388
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
AN EVALUATION TO SEE WHAT THEY

389
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
ARE CAPABLE OF.

390
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
FOR MY 9 AND 11-YEAR-OLD.

391
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
MY 11-YEAR-OLD WATCHED AND

392
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
WALKED AWAY.

393
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I TRIED TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL

394
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
BUT I SEE ON THE NEXT DAY I HAD

395
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
TO KEEP THEM GOING BECAUSE THEY

396
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
WERE UPDATED.

397
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
MY 9-YEAR-OLD SAID DO YOU THINK

398
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000

THEY HAD WALKED TWO-MILES

506
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE NEAREST

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
PARKING PLACE.

508
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
IT WAS NEWTOWN CONNECTICUT BUT

509
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE.

510
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000

DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE ANSWERS.

518
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000

VIRGINIA TECH THERE WERE MORE

520
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
FATALITIES IN VIRGINIA TECH.

521
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
VIRGINIA TECH PEOPLE CAME FROM

522
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
AROUND THE COUNTRY.

>> IT IS.

526
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I THINK EVERYONE IS TRYING TO

527
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
LEARN FROM IT.

528
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
THEY SAY IF THIS IDEALIC TOWN A

529
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
TOWN YOU WANT TO MOVE TO ASPIRE

530
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
TO IT CAN HAPPEN THERE WITH NO

531
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
HISTORY OF GUN VIOLENCE NO

532
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
HISTORY OF CENTER LINES, PERIOD

533
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
IT CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE.  TAIT'S

534
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
NOT A THEORY.

535
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
IT CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE.

536
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
EARLIER TODAY ON KILMEADE AND

MADE IT SIMILAR TO 9-11.

539
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
WE KNOW WE ARE NOT TERROR PROOF

540
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
BUT WE TRY TO MAKE OURSELVES

541
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
TERROR PROOF AS BEST WE CAN.

542
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU DO

543
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
THAT IN THE SCHOOL WITHOUT

544
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000

KNOWING YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU
CAN TO KEEP YOUR CHILD SAFE.

554

IT UNALARMING AND IN THE PRIME

556
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
OF THEIR LIFE IN THEIR 40s THEY

557
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
ARE ALMOST GIVING BACK TO THEIR

558
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
COMMUNITY WITHOUT BLOWING THE

559
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
BUDGET I BELIEVE THAT WOULD GO A

560
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
LONG WAY.

561
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
>> I GREW UP IN CONNECTICUT.

562
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I HAVE BEEN IN NEWTOWN MANY

563
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
TIMES.

564
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
IT IS THE ONE TOWN OF ALL OF THE

565
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
TOWNS IN CONNECTICUT I NEVER

566
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IT TO

567
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
HAPPEN.
THEY CALL IT THE SAFEST TOWN IN

568
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
AMERICA I THINK 6TH OR 7TH

569
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
STATE.
IT DOES TAKE THE INNOCENCE AWAY

570
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
FROM ALL OF IT.

571
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
THIS WAS NOT A CITY WITH URBAN

572
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
PROBLEMS OR THE REST OF IT.

573
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
THIS IS AN IDEALIC LITTLE TOWN.

574
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
IMAGE IT'S NOT THAT BIG A TOWN.

575
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
JUST IMAGE CHRISTMAS.

576
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
IT IS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.

577
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
>> -- SURVIVOR'S GUILT IS HUGE.

578
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
>> WE ARE UP AGAINST A BREAK

579
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
HERE.
WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT OTHER

580
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
FACETS OF THE STORY.

581
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
ONE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO

582
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
NOTE.

583
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
WE PROTECT -- THINK ABOUT EVERY

584
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
SIPPING EL BANK YOU HAVE EVER

585
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
BEEN TO.

586
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
TELL ME ONE TIME YOU SEE A BANK

587
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
WHERE IT IS NOT GUARDED WITH

588
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
SOMEONE WITH OR WITHOUT A GUN

589
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE

590
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
DOING.
YOU SHOW ME A BANK WITHOUT A

591
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
GUARD I WILL SHOW YOU THE BANK

592
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
THAT IS NOT GOING TO GET R-- I

593
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
SHOW YOU THE BANK THAT WILL GET

594
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
ROBBED.

595
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
PUT SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO

596
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
HANDLE HIMSELF AND A WEAPON AT

597
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
THE DOOR OF ANY SCHOOL IN

598
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
AMERICA.

599
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
IF WE CAN DO IT FOR BANKS WE CAN

600
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
DO IT AT A SCHOOL.

601
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I WISH EVERY 20 ONE OF THESE

602
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
PARENTS WOULD GIVE A DIME FOR

603
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
THIS.
>> AS SOON AS HE SAW A COP, IF

604
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
WE GOT THERE EARLY ERROR SOONER.

605
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
>> GOT THERE 10 MINUTES BEFORE

606
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
THEY LOCKED THE SCHOOL DOWN,

607
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
TOO.
>> IF THEY HAVE SECURITY IN

608
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
THERE IT IS GOING TO SAVE LIVES.

609
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
>> WE HAVE TO GO.

610
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
WE MAY NEVER KNOW, I AM NOT

611
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
GOING TO USE HIS NAME.

612
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
THE SHOOTER WHY HE DID THIS

613
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
UNSPEAKABLE CRIME.
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS

614
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
OUT.

615
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER WHO WAS ONCE

617
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000

DETAILS ABOUT THE MOTIVE OR

695
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
MENTAL STATE OF THE GUNMAN ADAM

696
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
LANZA.

697
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW EXACTLY

698
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY.

699
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER HAS THOUGHTS

700
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
ON WHAT THE FOCUS SHOULD BE.

701
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
>> YOU HAVE THE PSYCHOLOGIST THE

702
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
SHOOTER YOU HAVE A WEAPON AND

703
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT.

704
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I TEND TO GRAVITATE TOWARD THE

705
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
PSYCHOLOGY OF THE KILLER.

706
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE DETAILS

707
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
OF THE CRIME HE BEGAN BY

708
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
SHOOTING HIS MOTHER IN THE FACE.

709
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
THAT I THINK IS WHERE I WOULD

710
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
START.
ALTHOUGH I THINK ALL OF THE

711
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
ISSUES HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED.

712
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
>> WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE

713
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
DETAILS AND TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF

714
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN SOME KIND OF

715
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
DESPERATE HOPE FROM TRYING TO

716
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
STOP IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

717
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
IT'S A NECESSARY PROCESS TO GO

718
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
THROUGH TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHY

719
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
THIS HAPPENED, WHAT WENT WRONG.

720
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES THE

721
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
MOTHER WAS VERY DEVOTED REALLY

722
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
TRYING TO ATTEND TO HER SON TO

723
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
FOCUS ON DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS AND

724
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
CHALLENGES EVEN BROUGHT HIM OUT

725
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
HOME SCHOOLED TO PUT HIM IN A

726
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
MORE COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT

727
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
BECAUSE HE FACED SOCIAL

728
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
CHALLENGES.
WHAT HAPPENED.

729
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW.

730
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
>> I GRAVITATE TO WANT WILL

731
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
{SUFFIXÑ]LING TO KNOW THAT, TOO.

732
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
THE POLICY QUESTION ABOUT GUNS

733
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
AND MAYBE EVEN MENTAL HEALTH I

734
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
THINK WILL BE A PART OF WHATEVER

735
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA DECIDES TO GO

736
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
FORWARD WITH.

737
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
THE THING THE ARTICLE THAT WENT

738
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
AROUND RETWEETED A NUMBER OF

739
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
TIMES.

740
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
SHE WAS A MOTHER SHE SAID I AM

741
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
ADAM LANZA'S MOTHER.

742
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
SHE DESCRIBED IN HEARTBREAKING

743
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
DETAIL WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO HAVE

744
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
A CHILD JUST WHAT SHE SAID BASED

745
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
ON DESCRIPTION SEEMED MAYBE

746
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS

747
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
THIS OTHER CHILD -- NOT CHILD

748
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
BUT THE KILLER I SHOULD SAY CH

749
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
HE WAS A SON AND THERE WAS A

750
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
DEVOTED MOTHER.

751
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
YOU THINK THERE MIGHT BE A LOT

752
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
OF PARENTS WHO ARE THINKING WHAT

753
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
CAN I DO?
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

754
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
DID HE HAVE EVERYTHING HE

755
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
NEEDED.
OBVIOUSLY NOT OR MAYBE THERE IS

756
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
JUST NO SIM TELL ANSWER TO THIS

757
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
QUESTION.

758
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
CHARLES IS SOMEBODY THAT I WOULD

759
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
TURN TO TO SAY HELP ME

760
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND

761
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
THIS.

762
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
>> ERIC?
>> THAT PEAIECE IS AMAZING.

763
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
A MOM ON A BLOG SPOT I PULLED IT

764
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
UP IT HAD A THOUSANDS COMMENTS.

765
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
HERE'S THE THING.

766
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
THERE ARE SO MANY THEORIES

767
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BLAME GUNS

768
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
AND MENTAL HEALTH AND VIDEO

769
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
GAMES AND RELIGION, BREAKDOWN IN

770
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
FAMILY.
WE NEED TO POINT SOMETHING OUT.

771
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
THERE WAS SO MUCH MISINFORMATION

772
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
THAT WAS PUT OUT THERE THERE WAS

773
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
A SECOND SHOOTER, THE SHOOTER

774
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
KILLED HIS FATHER FIRST.

775
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
THAT THE MOTHER WAS IN AT THE

776
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
SCHOOL.
WE NEED TO TAKE A BREATH LET THE

777
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
POLICE TO THEIR WORK PUT OUT THE

778
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
DETAILS WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS

779
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
MENTAL ISSUES THEN WE CAN START

780
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
TO ASSIST.

781
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
>> EVERYBODY NEEDS TO SOLVE THIS

782
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
PROBLEM.

783
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
THERE WILL BE A DAY FOR THAT

784
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
JUST FOR ME NOT YET.

785
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
>> IT IS TRUE THE HIGH SCHOOL

786
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
WHERE HE WENT SCHOOL MEMBERS THE

787
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
STAFF TEACHERS COUNSELORS

788
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
SECURITY PEOPLE MONITORED THIS

789
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
GUY BECAUSE HE HAD A SERIES OF

790
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
OBVIOUS PROBLEMS.

791
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
ONE OF THE THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT

792
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED

793
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
THESE KINDS OF HEINOUS CRIMES

794
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ALL HAVE

795
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
HAD MENTAL PROBLEMS AT ONE TIME

796
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
OR ANOTHER.

797
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
IT IS PROBABLY SAFE TO SAY A

798
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
SANE PERSON WOULD NOT DO THIS.

799
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
THE QUESTION IS IN A STATE LIKE

800
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
CONNECTICUT WHERE THE GOVERNOR

801
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
ADMITTED THEY CUT BACK SERIOUSLY

802
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
ON MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING AND

803
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
THEIR BUDGETS THE QUESTION IS,

804
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
THAT IS A LEGITIMATE QUESTION

805
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
PUBLIC POLICY QUESTION IS ARE WE

806
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
PUTTING OUR ASSETS IN THE WRONG

807
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
PLACE.
THIS GUY NOT JUST MONITOR HIM

808
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
BUT SHOULD HE HAVE HAD

809
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
COUNSELING?

810
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
>> OR IN A SPECIAL HOME.

811
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
HE WAS GETTING COUNSELING.

812
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
>> I AM NOT AS SMART AS CHARLES

813
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
KRAUTHAMMER BUT I WILL SAY THIS.

814
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
HE KNEW HOW TO SMASH HIS

815
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
COMPUTERS HE KNEW HOW TO GET

816
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
BODY PROTECTION, HE PLAYED A AN

817
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
ESPECIALLY BRUTAL GAME.

818
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
IT BREAKS UP MARRIAGES.

819
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
IF MY KID WAS MENTALLY

820
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
UNBALANCED I WAS WORKING

821
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
24-HOURS A DAY TO MAKE THEM

822
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
UNBALANCED I WOULD NOT TRAIN

823
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
THEM TO USE LETHAL WEAPONS.

824
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
>> WOULDN'T YOU HAVE LOCKED YOUR

825
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
GUNS UP?

826
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
>> ARE WE ASSUMING -- WE ARE

827
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
DOING THE EXACT THING AREN'T WE

828
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
JUMPING TO A CONCLUSION HE WAS

829
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
MENTALLY ILL.

830
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
CLEARLY HE HAD ISSUES.

831
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
WAS HE DIAGNOSED?

832
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
WAS HE ON MEDICATIONS?

833
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
>> I CAN'T REMEMBER IF IT WAS

834
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
WRITTEN BYRON IN THE NATIONAL

835
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
JOURNAL OR TWEETED BY HIM.

836
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
IT WAS ABOUT LET'S NOT JUMP TO

837
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
CONCLUSIONS HERE ABOUT A LINK I

838
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
THINK HE WAS SAYING IN THE

839
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
"WASHINGTON POST" THERE ISN'T

840
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
NECESSARILY A LINK BETWEEN

841
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
AUTISM AND VIOLENCE OR

842
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
ASPERGER'S AND VIOLENCE.

843
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I THINK IT'S SMART TO TAKE A

844
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
STEP BACCALAUREATE THE

845
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
INVESTIGATORS DO THE POLICE WORK

846
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
THEY KNEED AND LET'S GET SOME

847
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
PSYCHIATRISTS, PEOPLE TOGETHER

848
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
TO SEE WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO

849
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
TRY TO HELP THESE FAMILIES

850
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
PREVENT TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS.

851
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
>> STARTED OFF WITH PROTECTING

852
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
THE SCHOOLS.

853
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
>> GOOD POINT.

854
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
>> YOU CAN DO THAT.

855
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
WHEN WE COME BACK THE POLITICS

856
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
OF GUNS.
IS IT TOO SOON?

857
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG IS MAKING A

858
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
BIG PUSH FOR GUN CONTROL.

859
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
SHOULD POLITICIANS BE PUSHING

860
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
THESE ISSUES SO QUICKLY?

861
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
THAT DISCUSSION WHEN WE COME

862
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
BACK.
NEW YORK

863
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
WITH MY COLLEAGUES.

864
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
>>> THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME WE

865
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
HAVE COME TOGETHER TO COMFORT A

866
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
GRIEVING COMMUNITY TORN APART BY

867
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
MASS SHOOTINGS.

868
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
WE CAN'T TOLERATE THIS ANY MORE.

869
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
THESE TRAGEDIES MUST END.

870
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
TO ENTHEM WE MUST CHANGE.

871
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA CALLING FOR

872
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
CHANGE FOLLOWING THE SANDY HOOK

873
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
MASSACRE.
STOPPED SHORT OF DEFINING WHAT

874
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
THAT CHANGE SHOULD BE.

875
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
TODAY NEW YORK CITY MICHAEL

876
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
BLOOMBERG HAD NO PROBLEM

877
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
DEFINING THAT.
HE'S A GUN CONTROL ADVOCATE.

878
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
HE MADE HIS POSITION CLEAR

879
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
AGAIN.
>> TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT SAID HE

880
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
WOULD USE WHATEVER POWERS HIS

881
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
OFFICE HOLDS TO ADDRESS THIS

882
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
VIOLENCE.
I THINK IT IS CRITICAL THAT HE

883
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
DO SO.

884
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE HAS

885
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT

886
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
STOPS THIS KARNAGE NO MATTER

887
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
WHAT THE POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS

888
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
ARE.
>> SHOULD WE FOCUS ON GUN

889
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
CONTROL?
IS THE TIME RIGHT?

890
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
>> FRANKLY, I AM GETTING A

891
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
LITTLE BIT SADDENED BY PEOPLE

892
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
WHO SAY THAT THOSE OF US WHO

893
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
BELIEVE IN GUN CONTROL THAT NOW

894
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
IS NOT THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT

895
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
IT.
IT IS GENERALLY A WAY FOR GUN

896
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
ADVOCATES TO PUT OFF THE SUBJECT

897
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
UNTIL THINGS COOL DOWN.

898
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
NOW IS EXACTLY THE TIME TO TALK

899
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
ABOUT IT.

900
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
THERE IS NOW A QUESTION.

901
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
THAT IS SHOULD YOU HAVE A WILD

902
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
GUY EQUIVALENT OF AN M 16.

903
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
THAT IS AN ASSAULT WEAPON.

904
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEW

905
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
CONGRESS A BAN ON ASSAULT

906
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
WEAPONS.
THERE WAS A BAN ON ASSAULT

907
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
WEAPONS FROM 94 TO 2004.

908
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
IT WAS NOT A REUP.

909
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
PRESIDENT BUSH STDECIDED NOT TO

910
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
REUP AND PRESIDENT OBAMA DECIDED

911
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
NOT TO REUP.

912
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

913
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
AT A MINIMUM, A BARE MINIMUM WE

914
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
HAVE TO TAKE ASSAULT WEAPONS AND

915
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
MAKE THEM ILLEGAL IN EVERY

916
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
POSSIBLE WAY.
THOSE GUNS DON'T HUNT ANIMALS

917
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
THEY HUNT PEOPLE.

918
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
>> THAT HAS TO BE ONE ELEMENT TO

919
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
LOOK AT GUNS BUT THAT'S NOT IT.

920
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
>> FIRST OF ALL AN ASSAULT

921
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
WEAPON.
FROM THE EARLY MORNING WE HAD A

922
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
MEETING I SAID I DON'T WANT TO

923
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
DO THIS GUN CONTROL DISCUSSION

924
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A DAY PLACE

925
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
AND A TIME FOR ALL THAT.

926
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
WE CAN'T DO IT.

927
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
LET'S NOT BE LIKE BLOOMBERG,

928
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
BILL MAHER BOB BECKEL AND JUMP

929
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
OUT WHILE WE ARE BURYING OUR

930
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
KIDS AS WE SPEAK.

931
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT GUNS.

932
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

933
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
WE ARE USING DEATHS OF CHILDREN

934
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
TO PUSH OUR POLITICAL AGENDA.

935
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
YOU ARE MY GOOD FRIEND BUT YOU

936
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
ARE ABSOLUTELY WRONG.

937
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
>> YOU ARE WRONG TO SAY WE CAN'T

938
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
TALK ABOUT THIS NOW.

939
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
>> I REFUSE TO HAVE THIS

940
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
CONVERSATION.
>> WHEN WILL THAT TIME AND PLACE

941
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
BE?
>> WHEN OUR CHILDREN ARE BURIED,

942
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
BOB.
>> HOW ABOUT THIS.

943
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
BILL BENNETT FEELS DIFFERENT

944
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
LANED CONGRESSMAN GOER FEELS

945
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
DIFFERENTLY.
IF THAT PRINCIPAL HAD A GUN

946
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
INSTEAD OF LUNGING WITH JUST HER

947
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
BODY SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE

948
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
OUT THAT GUNMAN.

949
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
HERE'S WHAT BILL BENNETT

950
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
SUGGESTED EARLIER YESTERDAY.

951
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
>> I AM SURE I WILL GET MAIL FOR

952
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
THIS.
I AM NOT SO SURE I WOULDN'T WANT

953
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
ONE PERSON IN A SCHOOL ARMED,

954
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
READY FOR THIS KIND OF THING.

955
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
THE PRINCIPAL LUNGED AT THIS

956
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
GUY.
THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST LUNGED

957
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
AT THE GUY.

958
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
HAS TO BE SOMEONE WHO IS TRAINED

959
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
HAS TO BE SOMEONE RESPONSIBLE.

960
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
BUT MY GOD IF YOU CAN PREVENT

961
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
THIS KIND OF THING,IC Y I THINK

962
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
OUGHT TO.
>> SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT THIS

963
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
NOW?
>> WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

964
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
IT.
IT WAS INTERESTING I WAS

965
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
THINKING BACK, NOT ONE OF THE

966
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
OBAMA ROMNEY DEBATES THIS

967
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
QUESTION DIDN'T COME UP AT ALL.

968
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
THAT'S WHY I FEEL A LITTLE BIT

969
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
OH NOW YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

970
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
IT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA TALKED ABOUT --

971
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
HE MENTIONED FORT HOOD I

972
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
WOULDN'T PUT IT IN THE SAME

973
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
CATEGORY ON THAT ONE.

974
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
WHY COULDN'T BOTH THINGS BE

975
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
TRUE.
WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT ARMING

976
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
THE SCHOOLS AND THEN IF SOMEONE

977
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
CAN PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT BAN ON

978
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS WOULD HELP

979
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
PREVENT THIS.
I WOULD BE OPEN MINDED UNLESS I

980
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
CAN THINK ABOUT THAT IN ADDITION

981
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
TO THE MENTAL HEALTH THINGS WE

982
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ON THIS

983
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
SHOW IN PARTICULAR FOR THE PAST

984
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
COUPLE OF MONTHS.

985
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
>> LOOK, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

986
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
DISCUSSION.
I GO OUT TO THE FAMILY ON THIS

987
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
ON TERMS OF WHEN IS THE RIGHT

988
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
TIME TO DISCUSS THIS.

989
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
THE FUNERALS AND HONORING THE

990
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
LIVES OF THE VICTIMS IS

991
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
PARAMOUNT AND THEN HAVE

992
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
DISCUSSION WITH COURAGE AND

993
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
CLARITY BUT I BELIEVE WE NEED TO

994
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
HAVE IT.
>> LOOK AT GUNS LOOK AT

995
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
PROTECTING THE CLASSROOMS ALL

996
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
PART OF ONE COMMISSION GIVEN A

997
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
DEADLINE TO REDUCE THE ASSAULT.

998
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
>> I AM NOT SURE THE FAMILIES

999
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
WOULD WANT TO HAVE THE

1000
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
DISCUSSION ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE.

1001
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
SOMEONE GIVE ME ONCE TO HAVE AN

1002
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
ASSAULT WEAPON IN THIS COUNTRY.

1003
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
>> OKAY.

1004
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
THERE'S A FANTASY LAND OF SAYING

1005
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
WAE A MAGIC WAND IT WILL NEVER

1006
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
HAPPEN AGAIN.

1007
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I THINK THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE

1008
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
IN THE SCHOOL TO MAKE SURE

1009
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
THERE'S A DETERRENT.

1010
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
THE COLORADO SHOOTER WENT TO

1011
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
THREE MOVIE THEATERS BEFORE HE

1012
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
WENT TO THAT ONE BECAUSE HE WAS

1013
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
DETERRED, THERE WAS CONCEALED

1014
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
CARRY WAS AVAILABLE AT THE OTHER

1015
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
PLACE.
THAT WAS WHY.

1016
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
THERE'S A DETERRENT FACTOR WHILE

1017
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
WE TRANSITION INTO THE FANTASY

1018
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
LAND OF THERE BEING NO GUNS.

1019
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
>> I THINK IT WILL BE LOOKED AT.

1020
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
IT WILL BE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK

1021
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
AND HOPEFULLY NO POLITICS

1022
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
INVOLVED IN IT.

1023
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
15 MINUTES BEFORE THE TOP OF THE

1024
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
HOUR.
WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS AWFUL

1025
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
HAPPENS WHAT SHOULD SAY TO YOUR

1026
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
KIDS, WHAT SHOULD YOU SAY TO

1027
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
YOUR KIDS.

1028
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
WILL YOU HEAR WHAT ONE PASTOR

1029
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
TOLD THE BROTHER OF ONE OF THE

1030
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
VICTIMS.

1031
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
STAY WITH US.
[ Male Announcer ]
THIS IS AMY. AMY LIKES
TO INVEST IN THE MARKET.

1032
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
SHE ALSO LIKES TO RIDE
HER BIKE.

1033
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
SHE KNOWS THE POTENTIAL
FOR MAKING OR LOSING MONEY

1034
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
CAN POP UP ANYTIME.

1035
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
THAT'S WHY SHE TRADES WITH
THE LEADER IN MOBILE TRADING.

1036
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
SO SHE'S ALWAYS READY
TO TAKE ACTION,

1037
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
NO MATTER HOW WILY...

1038
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
OR WEIRD...

1039
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
OR WONDERFULLY
THE MARKET'S BEHAVING...

1040
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
WHICH ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

1041
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.

1042
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
FROM TD AMERITRADE.

1043
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
>> ALMIGHTY AND EVER LASTING

1044
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
GOD, AS WE GRIEVE THE LOSS OF

1045
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
LIVE

1046
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
LIFE IN THE NEWTOWN CONNECTICUT

1047
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
SHOOTING SHOW US YOUR WAY AND

1048
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
TEACH US YOUR PATH.

1049
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
>> THAT WAS A PRAYER IN THE

1050
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
SENATE AHEAD OF A MOMENT OF

1051
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
SILENCE ON THE FLOOR FOR THE

1052
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
VICTIMS OF THE FRIDAY SCHOOL

1053
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
SHOOTING.

1054
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
AS A PARENT HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN

1055
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
SOMETHING SO EVIL FOR THE

1056
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
CHILDREN WHO ASK WHAT HAPPENED.

1057
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
HERE IS THE PASTOR AT LIMA

1058
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
CATHOLIC CHURCH TOLD THE

1059
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
BROTHERS OF ONE OF THE YOUNG

1060
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
VICTIMS.
>> I STARTED TALKING WITH HIM.

1061
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
HE SAID TO ME I DON'T HAVE

1062
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
ANYBODY TO PLAY WITH ANY MORE.

1063
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I HAVE LOST MY BEST FRIEND.

1064
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I SAID TO HIM THAT GOD IS GOING

1065
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
TO SEND YOU SOME WONDERFUL NEW

1066
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
FRIENDS.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.

1067
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR SISTER

1068
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
IN YOUR HEART AND I SAID TO HIM

1069
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY BECAUSE

1070
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
SHE IS VERY SAFE BECAUSE SHE IS

1071
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
WITH GOD WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT

1072
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
ABOUT WHAT HEAVEN WAS LIKE.

1073
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
HE REALIZED THAT SHE WAS GOING

1074
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
TO BE HAPPY, THAT SHE WAS GOING

1075
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
TO BE SAFE, BUT IT WAS SHORTLY

1076
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
AFTER THAT HE JUST BROKE DOWN

1077
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
INTO TEARS.

1078
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
>> I DON'T SUPPOSE MANY PEOPLE

1079
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
FORTUNATELY HAVE HAD TO GO

1080
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
THROUGH A TRAGEDY AS SEVERE AS

1081
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
THIS.

1082
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
WE HAVE ALL HAD OUR SHARE OF

1083
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
TRAGEDIES IN OUR LIVES IN MY

1084
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
CASE FROM A VERY DYSFUNCTIONAL

1085
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
FAMILIES.

1086
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
FOR YEARS I DIDN'T DEAL WITH IT

1087
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
DIDN'T TALK TO ANYBODY ABOUT IT.

1088
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
IT CAME BACK YEARS LATER TO

1089
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
HAUNT ME IN MANY WAYS I WISH IT

1090
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
HAD NOT INCLUDING CONTRIBUTING

1091
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
TO ADDICTION.

1092
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
ONE OF THE LESSONS IS YOU NEED

1093
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
TO GET THIS OUT AS FAST AS YOU

1094
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
CAN TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO KNOW

1095
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.

1096
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
OTHERWISE IT STAYS INSIDE

1097
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
BURIED.

1098
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
>> WE HAD THE PRINTS PAL OF

1099
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
COLUMBINE.
RIGHT AWAY HE HAD PTSD.

1100
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
HE KNOWS 10 YEARS FROM THE

1101
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
SHOOTING TEACHERS BREAKDOWN TEN

1102
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
YEARS LATER THEY WERE FINE BUT

1103
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
THE MEMORIES AND SEEING KIDS

1104
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
AGAIN IT BROUGHT IT ALL BACK.

1105
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
