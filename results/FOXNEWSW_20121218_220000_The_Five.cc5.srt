00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
>> Greg: HELLO, I'M GREG
GUTFELD WITH ANDREA TANTAROS,

2
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
BOB BECKEL, ERIC BOLLING, DANA

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
PERINO.

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK CITY.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
THIS IS "THE FIVE."

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
♪

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
♪

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
SO IN TIMES OF TRAGEDY, I KNOW

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
THAT OPINIONS OR FACTS DON'T

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
HELP THE SUFFERING.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
SAYING GUN VIOLENCE DROPPED

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
OVER 40 YEARS OR SCHOOLS ARE

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
SAFER THAN EVER, THAT MEANS

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
VERY IT WILL TO PEOPLE IN

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
SHOCK.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
IT'S JUST NOISE.
TO ME, IT'S LIKE GUN FREE

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
ZONES.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
IT SOUNDS GREAT BUT ONLY IN

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
MEDIA WHO WORKS IN GUN

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
PROTECTED ZONES.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
FORT HOOD, THE DEAD WEREN'T

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
CHILDREN BUT THEY WERE

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
WARRIORS, KILLED IN A GUN FREE

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
ZONE IN ARMY BASE.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
YOU THINK THE COWARD HASAN

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
EVIL SEEKS THE VULNERABLE.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
SO WHY CAN'T A SCHOOL BE

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
PROTECTED AS 30 ROCK?

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
IS A TALKING HEAD MORE

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
VALUABLE THAN A CHILD?

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
WHAT DO I KNOW?

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'M A TALKING HEAD.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I KNOW NOTHING.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
AS RARE AS THE HORRIBLE EVENTS

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
ARE, EVIL WILL ALWAYS BE.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
ISSUES HELP, AS WE FEEL AS THE

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
EVIL.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
EACH CREEP HAS THE SAME M.O.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
BUT WE REPORT IT LIKE IT'S

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
NEW.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO PONDER

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
INSTEAD OF PONTIFICATE.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
NOBODY IS LISTENING.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
THEY HEARD IT BEFORE.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
TRAGICALLY, WE HEAR IT ALL

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
AGAIN.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
SO THIS SEEMS LIKE WE

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
REPSYCHOTHE SAME ARGUMENT WHEN

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
THIS HAPPENS.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
IS IT GOING TO BE US VERSUS

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
THEM?
>> THIS ONE MIGHT BE

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
DIFFERENT.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I THINK THAT THE INNOCENCE OF

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
THE LIVES TAKEN, THE YOUNG

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
TENDERNESS OF THE AGE MADE

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
PEOPLE THINK WHAT CAN WE DO?

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
ASIDE FROM SOME PLACES WHERE

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
THE TALK IS ONLY ABOUT GUN

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
CONTROL, THERE HAS BEEN A

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
SENSE OF ANXIETY ABOUT WHAT WE

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
ARE NOT DOING TO HELP PROVIDE

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
FOR FAMILIES THAT HAVE A LOVED

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
ONE THAT IS MENTALLY ILL AND

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
NEEDS SERIOUS HELP BEFORE THEY

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
DO HARM TO NOBODY ELSE.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
THIS ONE COULD BE DIFFERENT.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
CAN DO.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
TO HELP PREVENT IT FROM

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
HAPPENING AGAIN.

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
>> IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
VARIABLES TO MENTAL HEALTH

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
ISSUES TO SCHOOL SECURITY, TO

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
GUN CONTROL PREVIOUSLY WE ONLY

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
FOCUSED ON GUN CONTROL.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
DOES IT MEAN THERE IS

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
PROGRESS?
>> Andrea: I DON'T KNOW.

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
AS HOPEFUL THAT I AM THAT DANA

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
IS RIGHT IT SEEMS WE HAVE ONE

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
SIDE SHOUTING THEIR POINT.

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
THE OTHER SIDE SHOUTING THEIR

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
POINT.
YOU COMEDIANS MAKING FUN OF

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
ONE SIDE, USUALLY CON

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
SEVENTIVES FOR TRYING TO

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
DEFEND THEIR POINT.

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
THERE SHOULD BE A WAITING

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
PERIOD.
THERE NEEDS TO BE TIME BEFORE

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
EVERYBODY JUMPS UP AND DOWN

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
ABOUT THIS.

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
SONG IS THERE TO DO A LOT OF

94
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THINGS.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
NOT JUST HANDLE THE FISCAL

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
CLIFF.
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
CONGRESS.
IT NEVER HAPPENS.

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
SOMEONE SAYS THIS IS A GREAT

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
MENTAL ILLNESS, THEN WE MOVE

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
TO GUN CONTROL.
I HOPE THIS TIME, I KNOW IT'S

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
CHRISTMAS TIME BUT I HOPE

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
WEEKS FOLLOWING UP TO THE NEW

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
YEAR PEOPLE WILL START TO HAVE

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
A DISCUSSION.

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
LISTEN, NOT YELL AT THE OTHER

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
SIDE.
>> Greg: YOU TALK ABOUT

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
GUNS, MENTAL ILLNESS AND

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
ALCOHOLISM, AND HOW THERE

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
SHOULD BE A SCREENING.

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
DO YOU THINK BECAUSE WE USE

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
GENERAL ILLNESS THE TOPIC

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
GENERALLY THAT IT SPREADS SO

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
THIN WE DON'T CATCH THE PEOPLE

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
THAT NEED HELP?

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
>> IN THIS INSTANCE, THE TOPIC

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
OF MENTAL HEALTH HAS BEEN MORE

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
PREVALENT THAN BEFORE.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
GUN CONTROL, I AM ONE THAT

120
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
PUSHED THAT HARD.

121
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
BUT THE MENTAL HEALTH QUESTION

122
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
IS SERIOUS AND REAL.

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
WE KNOW THAT THE FUNDS ARE CUT

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
BACK IN THE STATE.

125
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
LOCAL AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL

126
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
FOR THAT.
THEY BE PART AND PARCEL.

127
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
THIS IS A TIME PEOPLE START TO

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

129
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
VIDEO GAMES AND THE WAY PEOPLE

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
COMMUNICATE.

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
SO MAYBE THIS IS A BROADER

132
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
CONVERSATION.

133
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
HOW THAT IS TANG SEASONABLE

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
SOMETHING I HAVE A HARD TIME

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
FIGURING THAT OUT.
>> Greg: EVERYBODY DOES.

136
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I LOOK AT THIS AND THERE IS

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
ONE LINKAGE TO THE CATASTROPHE

139
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
AS THEY GET MORE AND MORE

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
GRUESOME, THEY BUILD UP ON

141
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
EACH OTHER.

142
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
THEY TEND TO INVOLVE THE

143
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
LONERS.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I DON'T LIKE

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
TALKING ABOUT THEM BECAUSE TO

145
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
ME, THEY ARE LOSERS.

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
BUT WE CANNOT AVOID THAT.

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
>> Eric: MADE THE POINT LAST

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
NIGHT.
NOT GOING TO MENTION THE GUY'S

149
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
NAME.

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
CALL HIM THE SHOOTER.

151
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
MADE A POINT LAST NIGHT, I

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
SAID I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
TIME OR THE PLACE FOR THE GUN

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
DISCUSSION.
THIS IS A WHOLE HOST OF

155
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
THINGS.
MENTAL HEALTH, VIDEO GAMES.

156
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
THE CULTURE AROUND WHAT THE

157
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
CHILDREN ARE BROUGHT, THE WAY

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
THE CHILDREN ARE BROUGHT UP

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
THAT THE VIOLENCE IS OKAY.

160
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
BLOW AWAY PEOPLE OR DO IT ON

161
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
TV OR A VIDEO GAME, IT'S

162
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
RELIGION.

163
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
BREAKDOWN OF THE FAMILY VALUE.

164
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
NUCLEAR FAMILY.

165
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
A HOST OF THINGS THERE.

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
HAS TO BE MEANINGFUL

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
DISCUSSION, NOT ALL OF IT

168
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
INCLUDING GUNS, I JUST CAN'T

169
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
DO IT RIGHT NOW.

170
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
TWO MORE BURIALS GOING ON

171
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
TODAY.

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
WHEN WE ARE THROUGH WITH THESE

173
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
THINGS AND IT'S TIME TO MOVE

174
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
ON TO THE DISCUSSION.

175
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
BOB AND I AND YOU, THE LEFT

176
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE DISCUSSION

177
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
OVER WHAT IS RIGHT.

178
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
WHETHER THE SECOND AMENDMENT

179
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
SHOULD STAY INTACT.

180
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
>> Bob: ONE THING WE AGREE

181
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
ON IS THE SCHOOLS COULD USE

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
PROTECTION.

183
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
IF YOU PUT ONE POLICEMAN ON

184
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
EVERY SCHOOL, $56,000 ON

185
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
AVERAGE TO PUT THEM IN THERE,

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
WHERE DO THE RESOURCES COME

187
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
FROM?
>> Eric: I BROUGHT THIS UP

188
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
LAST NIGHT.

189
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
WE PROTECT MONEY.

190
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
BANK PROS TEXT THE MONEY --

191
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
PROTECT MONEY MORE THAN THE

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
CHILDREN.

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
IT CAN'T BE A FEDERAL SOURCE,

194
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
BECAUSE IF YOU PUT FEDERAL

195
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
AGENTS IN THE SCHOOL, IT LOOKS

196
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
BAD.

197
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
THEY WILL SAY WHY ARE YOU

198
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
DOING THIS?

199
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WHY ARE YOU

200
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
DOING THIS?
IT HAS TO BE THE STATE LEVEL.

201
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
NEWS TODAY, GOVERNOR DONALD IN

202
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
VIRGINIA SAID HE IS LOOKING IN

203
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
TO THE STATE LEVEL PUTTING

204
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
SOCIAL TRAINING OFFICER AT THE

205
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
SCHOOLS.
THAT IS THE WAY TO GO.

206
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
>> Greg: FREEDOM COSTS

207
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
MONEY.
FOR OUR FREEDOM, YOU KNOW, WE

208
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
HAVE TO -- AT THE STATE AND

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
LOCAL LEVEL IT'S WORTH IT.

210
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
>> Andrea: WE DID IT

211
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
ENPLANES AFTER 9/11.

212
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
THERE WAS TALK ABOUT SECRET

213
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
AIR MARSHALLS.

214
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
THIS SCHOOL WAS EXTREMELY

215
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
SECURE AND YOU HAD TO BE

216
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
BUZZED IN WHEN YOU GOT IN.

217
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
A LOT OF SCHOOLS HAVE METAL

218
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
DETECTORS.

219
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I DO HOPE THAT MAYBE THE

220
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
DISCUSSION ON MENTAL ILLNESS

221
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
IS LESS STIGMATIZING.

222
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
YOU READ BLOGS ABOUT I AM

223
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
SHOOTER'S MOTHER.

224
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
DID HE HAVE ASPERGER.

225
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
WAS HE ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM?

226
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
WHATEVER THE CASE, THERE

227
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
MOTHER KNEW THERE WAS

228
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
SOMETHING WRONG.
HE WAS BURNING HIMSELF.

229
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
PUT YOURSELF IN THE SHOES OF

230
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
THAT MONEY.

231
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
VERY STIGMATIZING FOR HER AND

232
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
THE SHOOTER.

233
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
TO HANDLE THAT.

234
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
NO MOTHER WANTS TO RAT OUT HER

235
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
SON.

236
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
>> Andrea: THERE ARE EVENTS,

237
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
NOT SPECIFICALLY THESE THINGS

238
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
LIKE THE AURORA, COLORADO

239
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
THING, THAT THE LAW

240
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
ENFORCEMENT HATE TO DISCUSS

241
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
FOR FEAR OF COPYCAT.

242
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
SUICIDAL EVENTS THEY DON'T

243
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
BRING UP BECAUSE IT FOSTERS

244
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
SUICIDAL THOUGHTS IN OTHER

245
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
KIDS.

246
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
ARE WE CULPABLE THAT WE DELVE

247
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
IN DETAILS OF WHAT THE PERSON

248
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
IS, WHEN WE SHOULDN'T.

249
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
>> THERE IS A GOOD POINT ABOUT

250
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
NOT NAMING THE SHOOTER.

251
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
PEOPLE SAID DON'T GLORIFY IT.

252
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
HE'S GONE, SO IT DOESN'T HELP

253
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
HIM BUT COULD IT HELP SOMEONE

254
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
WITH THE TENDENCY OR FEELING

255
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
ABOUT TO SNAP TO THINK THIS

256
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
COULD BE MY ONE SHOT AT GLORY.

257
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT THERE TO

258
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
SEE IT.

259
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DON'T

260
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
COVER THE STORY.

261
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
TOUGH BALANCE.

262
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
>> Bob: ABOUT THE MOTHER,

263
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
SOME FACTS WE KNOW.

264
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
SHE USED GUNS SHE OWNED THAT

265
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
WERE REGISTERED TO HER.

266
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
HE SHOT HIS MOTHER AND GUNS

267
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
WERE AVAILABLE TO HIM IN THE

268
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
HOUSE.
IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SOMEONE

269
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
DISTURBED AS SHE DID KNOW, WHY

270
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
HAVE GUNS AVAILABLE TO HIM IN

271
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
THE HOUSE?

272
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
>> Bob: A TERRIBLE GUN --

273
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
>> Greg: SHE WAS A TERRIBLE

274
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
GUN OWNER.

275
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
>> Eric: LIKE TIMOTHY

276
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
McVEIGH WHO BLEW UP THE

277
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
TRUCK WITH FERTILIZER.

278
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
>> Andrea: I DON'T WANT TO

279
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
BLAME THE MOTHER BECAUSE MAYBE

280
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
HE SHOWED NO SIGNS OF THE

281
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
ACTUAL VIOLENCE, MAYBE AGAINST

282
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
HIMSELF.

283
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
PROBABLY THE FURTHEST THOUGHT

284
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
FROM HER MIND HE WOULD GO TO

285
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
THE GUN CLOSET AND SHOOT

286
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
SOMEBODY.

287
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
>> THE POLICE OFFICERS WANT TO

288
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
UNVALVE THE STORY.

289
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
FAMILIES DESERVE IT.

290
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
THEY WANT ANSWERS.

291
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
SO JUST AS IN THE COLORADO

292
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
SHOOTING FOUND OUT MORE ABOUT

293
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
IT.
ONE OF THE KEYS SO THAT IS

294
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM, THAT WE

295
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
WERE WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING

296
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
HAPPENING.

297
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
>> THERE IS ALWAYS -->>  --

298
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000

299
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
THAT ABOUT THIS ONE.

300
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
THE COMMUNITY MADE A WIDE

301
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
BERTH AROUND THE COMMUNITY AND
THEY WERE ALONE.

302
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
NOT THAT THE COMMUNITY WAS

303
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
BAD.
BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN LIFE

304
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
YOU TRY TO AVOID THE

305
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
SITUATIONS THAT ARE

306
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
UNCOMFORTABLE.
NOT A LOT OF SOCIAL

307
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
INTERSECTION.

When you're carrying
a lot of weight,

328
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
C-MAX has a nice little trait,

329
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You see, C-MAX helps
you load your freight,

330
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
with its foot-activated
lift gate.

331

all you'll see,

beats Prius v,

TODAY, SPEAKER BOEHNER

341
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
PROPOSED A BACKUP PLAN.

342
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
>> I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT

343
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
EVERY INCOME TAX IN AMERICA

344
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
WILL PAY A HIGHER RATE IN

JANUARY 1 UNLESS CONGRESS AC

346
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
ACTS.

347
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
SO I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO

348
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
PROTECT AS MANY AMERICAN

349
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
TAXPAYERS AS WE CAN.

350
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
OUR PLAN "B," WOULD PROTECT

351
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
THE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS WHO

352
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
MAKE $1 MILLION OR LESS.

SO-CALLED PLAN "B" IT MAKES NO

360
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000

HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY HERE TO

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
DO SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN SET

362
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000

WE ARE CLOSE TO BEING ABLE TO

ACHIEVE THAT.

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
HEARD THE WORDS "OBVIOUSLY."

377
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
>> Dana: OBVIOUSLY.

378
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
OBVIOUS TERRORISM.

379
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
IT'S OBVIOUS!

380
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
OBVIOUS.

381
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
IF THEY THINK THAT IT'S

382
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
OBVIOUS -- I DO THINK THEY

383
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
OVERESTIMATE HOW MUCH THE

384
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO

385
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
WAIT ON THIS.

386
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER HAS BASICALLY

387
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER TO

388
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
THEIR SIDE AND HANDED THEM THE

389
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
DEAL THEY ASKED FOR.

390
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER IS TAKING

391
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
POLITICAL HITS TO GET THE

392
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
REPUBLICANS TO COME WITH HIM.

393
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE

394
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
WHITE HOUSE WOULDN'T POCKET

395
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
THIS THING AND SAY THANK YOU

396
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
VERY MUCH.

397
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
MAYBE THEY ASK FOR ONE OF THE

398
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
THINGS BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

399
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
WHEN PELOSI AND HOYER SAID THE

400
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
PLAN "B" WAS A GENENTECHAL

401
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
PLOY.
IT WAS THE DEMOCRATIC TALKING

402
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
POINT THAT WENT OUT TO

403
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
EVERYONE AND EVERYBODY HAD TO

404
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
USE IT, THEY ARE MASKING THE

405
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
REAL PROBLEM.

406
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
THAT HE CANNOT DELIVER

407
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
DEMOCRATS ON THE REDUCTION OF

408
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
SPENDING.
THE P.R. FRONT.

409
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
THE DEMOCRATS MAKE REPUBLICANS

410
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
LOOK LIKE THE BAD GUY WHEN

411
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA CAN'T DELIVER

412
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
HIS OWN PARTY.

413
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
>> Bob: NOT CLEAR BOEHNER

414
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
CAN DELIVER REPUBLICANS ON

415
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
THIS.
>> Dana: BUT DOESN'T OBAMA

416
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
HAVE A RESPONSEABILITY TO

417
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
BRING DEMOCRATS?

418
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
>> Bob: HE DOES.

419
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
BOEHNER DOES AS WELL.

420
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
BOEHNER SAYS $1 MILLION.

421
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
IT WILL END UP IN BETWEEN THE

422
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
FIGURES.
IF YOU TAKE IN ACCOUNT WHAT

423
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
BOEHNER SAID ABOUT CUTTING,

424
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
WHAT HE SAID ABOUT CUTTING THE

425
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
TAX LOOPHOLES AND THE SAVINGS

426
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
ON MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, THE

427
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
TOTAL PACKAGE OF THE SAVINGS,

428
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
$4.6 TRILLION.

429
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

430
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
STATES WASN'T CUT IS $4

431
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
$4.6 TRILLION.

432
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
>> Andrea: YOU SAID

433
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
SOMETHING OFF-CAMERA TO ME.

434
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
YOU SAID IF THEY GET SUPPORT

435
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
FOR THE TAX NATION, THE

436
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
DEMOCRATS HAVE A PROBLEM ON

437
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
THEIR HAND.

438
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
>> Eric: WHY WOULDN'T?

439
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
THEY PROPOSED $1 MILLION.

440
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I THINK THERE WAS 50 SOMETHING

441
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
DEMOCRATS WHO SAID YEAH, A

442
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
COUPLE HELD OUT BUT YEAH.

443
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
MOVING TO 2010.

444
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
NOW NO WAY WILL IT FLY.

445
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
>> Bob: IT'S NEGOTIATING

446
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
PLOY ON EVERYBODY'S PART.

447
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I DON'T THINK BOEHNER THINK HE

448
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
IS WILL GET AWAY WITH

449
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
$1 BILLION.

450
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
IT WILL BE LOWER THAN THAT.

451
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
THEY CAN'T TAKE --

452
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
>> Eric: HOW DEMOCRATS BRING

453
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
IT TO REPUBLICANS TO SAY DO

454
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
THIS AND MAKE IT $1 MILLION.

455
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
>> Eric: WE MOVE THE

456
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
GOALPOST AGAIN.
THE STOCK MARKET KNOWS YOU

457
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
WILL GET A DEAL.

458
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
BECAUSE IT'S EMINNOCENT.

459
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
BUT YOU GET A BAD DEAL FOR

460
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
EVERYONE.
>> Andrea: THE REPUBLICANS

461
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
MEET BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.

462
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
IS HE BOEHNER DARKER TAN?

463
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
>> Greg: IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

464
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
SPENDING, NOT TAXES.

465
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
LOSING ON THIS SO THIS REMINDS

466
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
ME OF 1960 SITCOM ARGUMENT

467
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
BETWEEN A MARRIED COUPLE.

468
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
BOEHNER IS A SENSIBLE LONG

469
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
SUFFERING HUSBAND TRYING TO

470
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
TIGHTEN THE PURSE STRINGS.

471
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
AND OBAMA IS LUCY RICARDO.

472
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
APPRECIATES SPENDING BECAUSE

473
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
IT'S FUN, FUN, FUN.

474
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
DOESN'T GET THE SAVINGS.

475
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
PERHAPS EPISODE OF GREEN

476
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
ACRES.

477
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
TALKING BIG IS PAUL KRUGMAN.

478
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
>> Eric: THE PLAN THAT

479
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
BOEHNER OFFERED -- THIS IS

480
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
HUGE.
SAID YOU KNOW WHAT?

481
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
WE WILL PUT UP THE DEBT

482
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
CEILING DEBATE FOR TWO YEARS.

483
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
THAT MEANS THE REPUBLICANS, IT

484
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
HAS TO GO THROUGH THE HOUSE,

485
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
SPENDING BILL COME THROUGH THE

486
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
HOUSE.

487
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
APPROVED.
THE HOUSE HAS TO APPROVE THE

488
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
DEBT CEILING INCES.

489
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
THEY SAID THEY PUT IT OFF FOR

490
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
TWO YEARS.

491
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
HE GAVE PRESIDENT OBAMA THE

492
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
BEST GIFT.

493
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
THE BEST DEAL THEY COULD DO.

494
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT

495
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
THINK HE GAVE THEM --

496
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
>> Bob: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

497
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
THIS IS NOT THE PELOSI-SCHUMER

498
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
PROPOSAL.
WHAT HE IS NOT SAYING THAT THE

499
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
REPUBLICANS WILL KEEP IN

500
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUTS FOR

501
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
EVERYBODY.
NOT DEALT WITH ANY OF THE

502
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
OTHER TAX ISSUES INVOLVED IN

503
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
THAT BILL.

504
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
HE SAID $1 MILLION.

505
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
THAT IS IT.

506
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
EVERYTHING ELSE STAYS THE

507
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
SAME.

508
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
EXCEPT FOR PEOPLE OVER

509
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
$1 MILLION.
>> Eric: SCHUMER HAD CAPITAL

510
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
GAINS RATE LOW.

511
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
SCHUMER DEAL.

512
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
>> Bob: I DON'T CARE WHAT

513
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
SCHUMER DID.

514
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
>> Andrea: THIS IS A P.R.

515
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
NIGHTMARE FOR BOEHNER.

516
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
WE HAVE GREAT REPORTING FROM

517
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
CHAD PERGRAM WHO SAID THEY

518
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
MIGHT BRING THIS TO THE DEAL

519
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
ON THURSDAY, PUT HIM ON

520
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
RECORD.
THEN THEY WOULD ONLY HAVE TO

521
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
VOTE FOR EXTENDING MIDDLE

522
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
CLASS TAX RATES.

523
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
THIS SNEAKY.

524
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
>> THEY SHOULD BE MAD ON

525
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
SPENDING FROM BOTH SIDES.

526
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
DOUBLE TRIPLE COUNTING.

527
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
IT'S UNCLEAR.

528
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
THIS IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR

529
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
AMERICA TO CHANGE COURSE WITH

530
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
MAJOR TAX REFORM.

531
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
MAJOR ENTITLEMENT REFORM.

532
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
THAT IS THE POINT, THE WHOLE

533
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
POINT OF THE FISCAL CLIFF TO

534
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
PUSH THEM TO TRY TO DO

535
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
SOMETHING ON ENTITLEMENT

536
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
REFORM.

537
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
WHAT ARE WE GETTING?

538
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
ZERO ON THAT.

539
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
>> Bob: WE ARE GETTING

540
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
BOEHNER PLAN "B" THAT TAKES

541
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
THE BUSH LEGISLATION TO PUT IT

542
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
IN EFFECT --

543
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
>> Dana: THAT IS NOT WHAT

544
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
THE FISCAL CLIFF WAS ABOUT.

545
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
>> Bob: I UNDERSTAND THAT.

546
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
>> Dana: THAT IS WHAT I'M

547
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
SAYING IT'S A HUGE MISSED

548
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
OPPORTUNITY.

549
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
WE ARE GOING TO GET THE

550
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
TINKERING.
PERHAPS MAYBE MORE PERMANENCY.

551
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
THE STOCK MARKET WILL BE HAPPY

552
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
FOR SIX MONTHS.

553
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
THE MID-TERMS BECOMES HARDER.

554
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
BOEHNER DID A GOOD JOB.

555
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
THEY THINK HE SCREWED UP BUT

556
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'D LIKE THEM TO NAVIGATE THE

557
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
WATER.

558
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
>> Andrea: COME TO THE

559
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000

00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
but with ADVAIR,
I'm breathing better.

796
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
So now I can be in
the scene.

797
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
ADVAIR is
clinically proven to help

798
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
significantly improve

799
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
lung function.

800
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Unlike most COPD medications,

801
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
ADVAIR contains both an
anti-inflammatory

802
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and a
long-acting bronchodilator

803
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
working together to help improve
your lung function all day.

804
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
ADVAIR won't
replace fast-acting inhalers

805
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
for sudden symptoms

806
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
and should not be used more
than twice a day.

807
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
People with
COPD taking ADVAIR

808
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
may have a higher chance
of pneumonia.

809
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
ADVAIR may increase your
risk of osteoporosis

810
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
and some eye problems.

811
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Tell your doctor
if you have a heart condition

812
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
or high blood pressure before
taking ADVAIR.

813
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
If you're still
having difficulty breathing,

814
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
ask your doctor if including
ADVAIR could help

815
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000

904
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
RECOGNIZED IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

905

SHOW THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES

907
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000

908
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I DON'T THINK THE INTENTIONS

909
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
WERE BAD.

910
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
BUT THE COWBOYS SHOULD KNOW

911
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
ABOUT THE CONTROVERSY PEOPLE

912
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000

THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS

917
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000

BUT I AGREE YOU HAVE YOUNG

918
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
KIDS IN THE AUDIENCE WITH

919
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000

920
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
THEY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

921
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
IT MAKES IT SEEM YOU CAN DO

922
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
THIS AND BE ON THE SIDELINE.

923
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
THEY SAID THEY ARE NOT GOING

924
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
TO LET HIM ON THE SIDELINE

925
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
ANYMORE.
IT'S VERY SMART.
I DON'T THINK THEY DID IT

926
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
MALICIOUSLY, THOUGH.

927
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I UNDERSTAND THEY WANT TO

928
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
SUPPORT HIM.
BUT IF IT HAPPENED ON OUR TEAM

929
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
IT WOULD BE WEIRD.
WOULD HAVE COULD YOU NOT

930
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
NOTICE HE WAS THERE?

931
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
>> Bob: HOW DO YOU NOT

932
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000

935
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
WE KNOW WHO HE IS.
IT WAS A TERRIBLE DECISION TO

00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
PEOPLE WANT TO EAT

1068
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
McDONALD'S, THAT IS GREAT.

1069
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000

1071
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
WORD.

1072
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I THINK IT WAS -- I DON'T WANT

1073
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
TO BE HYPOCRITICAL.

1074
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I THOUGHT IT WASN'T NECESSARY

1075
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
FOR SHOPS TO BE OPEN ON

1076
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
THANKSGIVING.

1077
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
BUT I GUESS THAT WORKED OUT

1078
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
OKAY FOR PEOPLE IF THEY WANT

1079
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
TO SHOP, THEY COULD.

1080
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
IF YOU WANT TO EAT

1081
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000

1082
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I DON'T HAVE ANY FOOD IN THE

1083
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
HOUSE.

1084
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
MIGHT WORK OUT WELL FOR ME.

1085
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
>> Bob: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1086
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
EAT ATED?

1087
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000

1089
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
NOT EVERYBODY CAN BE OBAMA'S

1091
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
BY THE WAY, THIS WOULD BE A

1092
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
GREAT PROMOTIONAL THING TO

00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
BRING BACK IN THE HOLIDAYS,

1094
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000

WORK SO THEY GET FIRED?

1107
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
