00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
WANT HER NOMINATION TO

226
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000

AMBASSADOR RICE HAS BEEN

229
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
UNDER FIRE AS YOU KNOW WEEKS

230
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
AFTER MAKING STATEMENTS

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000

IN THE WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED

240
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
LEADING REPUBLICANS TO TRY

242
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
TO SMOOTH OVER THINGS.

243
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000

DISRUPTIVE BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
HE IS ALSO A FOX NEWS

381
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
CONTRIBUTOR.

382
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
MR. AMBASSADOR, I'M GUESSING

383
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
YOU READ THE LETTER TO THE,

384
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
THE OP-ED PIECE IN "THE

385
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
WASHINGTON POST" THIS

386
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
MORNING WHICH SUSAN RICE

387
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
TALKS ABOUT WHY SHE DECIDED

388
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
TO SUBMIT HER WII DRAWL

389
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
LETTER FROM CONSIDERATION.

390
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
SHE WRITES THIS AS IT BECAME

391
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
CLEAR MY POTENTIAL

392
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
NOMINATION WOULD SPARK

393
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
ENDURING PARTISAN BATTLE I

394
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
CONCLUDED IT WOULD BE WRONG

395
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
TO ALLOW THIS DEBATE TO

396
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
CONTINUE DISTRACTING FROM

397
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
URGENT NATIONAL PRIORITIES.

398
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
WERE THERE ANY ENDURING

399
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
PARTISAN BATTLES WHEN YOU

400
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
WERE SERVING IN THAT SAME

401
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
JOB?

402
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
>> WELL, PROBABLY SO BUT YOU

403
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
KNOW, WHAT'S UNUSUAL ABOUT

404
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OBVIOUSLY

405
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
IS SHE HAD NOT BEEN

406
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
NOMINATED YET AND TO HAVE

407
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
THE LITTLE EXCHANGE THAT WE

408
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
HAD YESTERDAY, SHE WRITES TO

409
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
THE PRESIDENT.

410
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
THE PRESIDENT ISSUES A

411
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
STATEMENT, RESULTS IN THE

412
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

413
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
PREEMPTIVELY SURRENDERING ON

414
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
A WAR THAT HADN'T BEEN

415
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
DECLARED YET.

416
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
YOU KNOW WHEN JIM BAKER WAS

417
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
CHIEF OF STAFF FOR RONALD

418
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
REAGAN, HE OPERATED ON A

419
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
PRINCIPLE THAT THE PRESIDENT

420
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
NEVER LOSES.

421
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THAT YOU TRY AND STRUCTURE

422
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
THINGS SO THAT THE PRESIDENT

423
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
DOESN'T TAKE ANY UNNECESSARY

424
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
HITS BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING

425
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
TO MAXIMIZE THE PRESIDENT'S

426
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
INFLUENCE.
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE

427
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
WHITE HOUSE FOR REASONS

428
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
UTTERLY INEXPLICABLE TO ME

429
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
ANNOUNCING THEY HAVE LOST

430
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
WHEN THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO

431
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
IT.
THEY COULD HAVE NOMINATED

432
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
JOHN KERRY, WHOMEVER, SAID

433
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
HE WAS LEADING CONTENDER ALL

434
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
ALONG AND AWAY THEY GO.

435
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I THINK IT IS A REAL

436
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
INCENTIVE FOR REPUBLICANS ON

437
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
THE HILL ON THE FISCAL CLIFF

438
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
TALKS OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT

439
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
BE, NOT TO OVERESTIMATE THE

440
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
PRESIDENT'S POLITICAL POWER.

441
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
JON: SHE WROTE ONE OTHER

442
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
THING THAT CAUGHT MY EYE.

443
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
SHE SAID, AFTER THE

444
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
DESPICABLE TERRORIST ATTACKS

445
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
THAT TOOK THE LIVES OF FOUR

446
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
COLLEAGUES IN BENGHAZI OUR

447
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
BOUGHT MUST WORK THROUGH

448
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
SERIOUS QUESTIONS AND BRING

449
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
THE PERPETRATORS TO JUSTICE.

450
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
WE MUST STRENGTHEN SECURITY

451
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
AT OUR DIPLOMATIC POSTS AND

452
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
IMPROVE INTELLIGENCE IN A

453
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
VOLATILE MIDDLE EAST.
IS THAT A BIT LIKE CLOSING

454
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
THE BARN DOOR AFTER THE

455
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
HORSES ESCAPED?

456
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
>> EXACTLY.

457
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
THAT IS WHAT SENATOR GRAHAM

458
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN SAYING.

459
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS

460
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
THE INVESTIGATION ON

461
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
BENGHAZI.
WHY THE REQUESTS FOR

462
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
ENHANCED SECURITY BEFORE THE

463
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
ATTACK ON SEPTEMBER THE 11th

464
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
NOT GRANTED?

465
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
WHY WERE WE UNABLE TO DO

466
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
ANYTHING ON THE SEPTEMBER
THE 11th AND WHERE DID THE

467
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
ADMINISTRATION COME UP WITH
THE STORY THAT THE TERRORIST

468
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
ATTACK WAS SOMEHOW CONNECTED

469
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
TO THE MOHAMMED VIDEO?

470
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
IN A WAY I THINK SUSAN

471
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
RICE'S WITHDRAWAL OF HER

472
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
SECRETARY OF STATE CANDIDACY

473
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
REALLY CLEARS A WAY

474
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
POTENTIAL OBSTACLE.

475
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
NOW THERE IS NO TALK ABOUT

476
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
RACISM OR SEXISM.

477
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
NOW WE CAN GET TO THE POINT

478
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF ASKED

479
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
FOR, WHAT DID HE DO WRONG?

480
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
WHAT DID HIS ADMINISTRATION

481
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
DO WRONG THAT LED TO FOUR

482
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
AMERICANS BEING MURDERED?

483
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

484
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
PROCEED DOWN THAT ROAD,

485
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
PERHAPS STARTING NEXT WEEK

486
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
WITH SECRETARY OF STATE

487
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
HILLARY CLINTON'S TESTIMONY

488
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
UP ON THE HILL.

489
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
JON: THAT IS GOING TO BE

490
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
FASCINATING TO WATCH.

491
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
AMBASSADOR BOLTON, GOOD TO

492
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
HAVE YOU ON.

493
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.

494
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
JENNA: WE'LL GET BACK TO THE

495
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING IN
CONNECTICUT.

496
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
WE'RE JUST LEARNING MORE

497
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
INFORMATION ON WHAT HAPPENED

498
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
THIS MORNING.

499
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
HARRIS, YOU HAVE MORE FOR US

500
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
IN THE NEWSROOM.
>> Reporter: LET'S CATCH

501
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
EVERYBODY UP IN CASE THEY'RE
JUST TUNING IN, JENNA.

502
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
THIS IS NEWTOWN,

503
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
CONNECTICUT.
THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

504
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
SCHOOL REPORTED A SHOOTING

505
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
HOUR AND A HALF AGO.

506
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
STATE POLICE IN CONNECTICUT

507
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
ARE ASSISTING LOCAL POLICE

508
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
HERE IN THE AREA AND HERE IS

509
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
WHAT IS BEING REPORTED OF

510
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
THE A DISPATCHER WITH THE

511
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
NEWTOWN VOLUNTARY AMBULANCE

512
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
CORPS SAID ONE TEACHER HAS

513
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
BEEN TRANSPORTED TO NEARBY

514
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
HOSPITAL IN DANBURY POSSIBLY

515
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
WITH A GUNSHOT WOUND.

516
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF

517
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
THAT INJURY.

518
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I CAN TELL YOU OTHER SCHOOLS

519
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
IN THE AREA ARE LOCKED DOWN.

520
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
THIS WOULD AFFECT 5400

521
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
CHILDREN IN THIS VERY SMALL

522
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
COMMUNITY IN THAT LOCKDOWN

523
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
POSITION.
THE SCHOOL WE'RE TALKING

524
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
ABOUT, JENNA, HAD TODDLERS

525
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
TO FIFTH GRADERS REPORTEDLY.

526
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS THEY ARE

527
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
ASKING PARENTS TO SIT BY A

528
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
PHONE AND WAIT FOR A CALL

529
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
FROM THE NEWTOWN CENTRAL

530
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
COMMUNITY CENTER.

531
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
THEY WANT THAT AS A DISPATCH

532
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
RATHER THAN PARENTS SHOWING

533
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
UP.

534
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
THEY WANT PARENTS TO STAY

535
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
BACK SO THEY CAN WORK THE

536
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
SCENE, SECURE IT BUT ALSO

537
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
TRY TO CATCH SUSPECTS OR ANY

538
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
EVIDENCE THAT THEY NEED TO

539
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
GATHER AT THAT TIME ALONG

540
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
WITH HELPING ANY POTENTIAL

541
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
INJURED.
BUT THE OTHER REASON IS THEY

542
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
WANT THOSE PARENTS TO BE IN

543
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
A LOCATION WHERE THEY CAN BE

544
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
EASILY REACHED.

545
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
SHOULD THE WORST HAPPEN AND

546
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
THEY NEED TO CONTACT THEM

547
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
ABOUT THAT.

548
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
SO THAT'S THE LATEST NOW.

549
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

550
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
A TOWN ON EDGE, SCHOOLS ON

551
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
LOCKDOWN AT THIS POINT.

552
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
NO MORE TO REPORT.

553
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
NO DETO REPORT ON THE ACTUAL

554
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
SHOOTER OR SHOOTERS IN THIS

555
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
BECAUSE THOSE REPORTS ARE

556
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
STILL UNCONFIRMED.

557
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I DON'T WANT TO FILL IN TOO

558
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
MANY DETAILS WE CAN'T FIRM

559
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
UP.
OUR FOX AFFILIATE FROM NEW

560
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000

561
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000

LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS

563
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
SITUATION OF COURSE WE'LL
BRING IT TO YOU.

564
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
JENNA.
JENNA: HARRIS, A LITTLE MORE

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCHOOL

BUT AGAIN WE HAVEN'T BEEN

943
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
ABLE TO SUBSTANTIATE THAT.

944
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000

WHAT ACTUALLY THE STUDENTS

948
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
SAW BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW,

949
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
AS WE CONTINUE TO REFLECT ON

950
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
THESE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, WHAT

951
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
THEY WITNESSED IS SOMETHING

952
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
THAT EVERY PARENT OR ANYONE

953
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
THAT, YOU KNOW, DON'T

954
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE A

955
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
PARENT TO CARE ABOUT WHAT

956
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000

957
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000

DEPARTMENT, JENNA, AND THEY

964
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
DID NOT INDICATE IN ANY WAY

965
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
SHAPE OR FORM THEY ARE

966
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
SEARCHING FOR ANYONE AT THIS
POINT.

967
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
THEY WOULD NOT CONFIRM MUCH

968
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
FOR ME ON THE PHONE.

969
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I CAN TELL YOU THIS.

970
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
ABOUT 15 MINUTES FROM NOW

971
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
THERE WILL BE A COMMAND POST

972
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
SET UP IN THE CENTER THERE,

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
RIGHT NEXT TO, THIS IS WHAT

974
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I LEARNED, RIGHT NEXT TO THE

975
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
TRIAGE PORTION.

976
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
JON, YOU POINTED OUT NO ONE

977
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
IS ON THAT TARP RIGHT NOW.

978
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
THEY HAVE TRANSPORTED ONE

979
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
PERSON.

980
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

981
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
DOING ON THE INSIDE TO BRING

982
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
PEOPLE OUT.
SO THAT MIGHT BE GOOD NEWS,

983
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
IT MIGHT NOT BE, THAT THERE

984
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
IS NO ONE OUT THERE ON THAT

985
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
TRIAGE RIGHT NOW.

986
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
JUST ADJACENT TO THAT WILL

987
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
BE A COMMAND POST IN A SHORT

988
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
LITTLE WHILE, SO PEOPLE CAN

989
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
BE TOLD, A, WHAT NUMBER YOU

990
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
CAN CALL IF YOU'RE A PARENT.

991
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
THEY HAVEN'T SET THAT UP BUT

992
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
THEY'RE WORKING ON IT.

993
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
THE FLIPSIDE IS THE NEWTOWN

994
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS

995
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
CENTER THEY WANT PARENTS TO

996
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
SIT BY THEIR PHONES AT HOME.

997
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I TOLD YOU THAT EARLIER.

998
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
WE WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM

999
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
THAT.
AT THIS POINT, AGAIN, NO

1000
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
CONFIRMATION THAT THEY'RE

1001
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
SEARCHING FOR ANYONE.

1002
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
AND HAVING SEEN SCENES LIKE

1003
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
THIS BEFORE, JON AND JENNA,

1004
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
THERE IS NOT THAT URGENCY ON

1005
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
FOOT FROM THIS LIVE PICTURE.

1006
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

1007
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
BECAUSE GENERALLY SPEAKING

1008
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
WHEN THERE IS ACTIVE SEARCH

1009
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
YOU SEE THAT URGENCY.

1010
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
IT COULD INDICATE ALONG WITH

1011
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
THE FACT THAT NO ONE SAID

1012
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
ANYTHING TO ME THEY WERE

1013
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
SEARCHING FOR ANYONE, THAT
THEY FEEL LIKE THIS SCENE IS

1014
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
CONTAINED.

1015
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
THEIR MAIN GOAL RIGHT NOW IS

1016
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
THE CHILDREN, SECURING

1017
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
SAFETY THERE AND ALSO

1018
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
GETTING AS MUCH INFORMATION

1019
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
OUT.

1020
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I ASSUME WE WILL LEARN MUCH

1021
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
MORE IN JUST A SHORT LITTLE

1022
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
WHILE AS THEY GET THAT

1023
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
COMMAND POST SET UP BUT I'VE

1024
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
GOT GOOD LINES OF

1025
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
COMMUNICATION INTO THE TOWN

1026
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
RIGHT NOW.
WE'LL UPDATE YOU AS I LEARN

1027
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
MORE.

ONE PERSON IN ONE ROOM HAD

1049
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
NUMEROUS GUNSHOT WOUND AGAIN

1050
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
ACCORDING TO POLICE.

1051
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
WE SAW ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
THAT STUDENTS WERE BEING LED

1053
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
OUT OF THE SCHOOL BY THEIR

1054
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000

AROUND THAT TIME, AROUND

1056
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000

1123
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
INJURED AT THE SCENE.

1124
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
ACCORDING TO SOME OTHER

1125
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
REPORTS, INCLUDING A LOCAL

1126
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
OFFICIAL, THE GUNMAN THAT IS

1127
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
AT THE CENTER OF THE

1128
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
SHOOTING IS DEAD.

1129
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
WE HAVE MULTIPLE REPORTS

1130
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
THAT ARE CONFLICTING ABOUT

1131
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
INJURIES AND WHO HAS BEEN

1132
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
INJURED.
SO WE'RE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL

1133
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
WE GET CAN GET MORE

1134
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
INFORMATION BEFORE BRINGING

1135
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
THAT TO YOU BUT AGAIN SANDY

1136
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 60

1137
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
MILES FROM NEW YORK CITY.

1138
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
SMALL COMMUNITY.

1139
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
RATHER LARGE ELEMENTARY

1140
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000

1143
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
A SHOOTING AT THIS

1144
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1145
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
BREAKING DETAILS AS WE COME

1146
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
INTO THE NEWSROOM.

1147
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
JON?
JON: NOW THAT U.N.

1148
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE

1149
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
OFFICIALLY HAS TAKEN HERSELF

1150
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
OUT OF THE RUNNING TO BECOME

1151
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
SECRETARY OF STATE THERE IS

1152
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
NEW SPECULATION WHO

1153
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NOMINATION

1154
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
WILL GO TO.
RIGHT NOW MASSACHUSETTS

1155
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
SENATOR JOHN KERRY

1156
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
CONSIDERED TO BE AT THE TOP

1157
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
OF THE LIST.

1158
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT WITH

1159
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
PAUL GIGOT, EDITORIAL PAGE

1160
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
EDITOR OF "THE WALL STREET

1161
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
JOURNAL." IRONIC, BECAUSE IF

1162
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
IT HAD BEEN SUSAN RICE, JOHN

1163
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
KERRY'S COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE

1164
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
TO CONFIRM HER IN THE

1165
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
SENATE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
JON: NOW THAT PROBLEM IS

1166
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
DONE AWAY WITH.

1167
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.

1168
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BIG

1169
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
FIGHT.

1170
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
JON: NOT A PROBLEM I SHOULD

1171
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
SAY.

1172
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
THE CIRCUMSTANCE.

1173
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
>> IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BIG

1174
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
POLITICAL FIGHT.

1175
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
IN THAT SENSE SUSAN RICE DID

1176
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
THE PRESIDENT A FAVOR BY

1177
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
REMOVING HERSELF FROM THE,

1178
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
FROM THE DISCUSSIONS SO THAT

1179
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
THEY WON'T HAVE TO HAVE THIS

1180
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
FIGHT AND THE PRESIDENT

1181
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
WON'T HAVE TO SPEND THE

1182
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
POLITICAL CAPITAL HE WOULD

1183
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
HAVE HAD TO SPEND TO GET HER

1184
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
CONFIRMED.
JON: INTERESTING, EVEN

1185
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
REPUBLICANS LIKE SENATOR

1186
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
McCAIN ARE GENERALLY

1187
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
PRAISING JOHN KERRY.

1188
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
IS HE A SLAM DUNK?

1189
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
>> REMEMBER, THE SENATE'S A

1190
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
CLUB.
JON: YEAH.

1191
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
>> LESS SO THAN IT USED TO

1192
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
BE BUT IT'S STILL A CLUB AND

1193
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
THE ONLY SENATOR THAT I CAN

1194
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
RECALL WHO WAS NOT CONFIRMED

1195
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
WHEN HE WAS NAMED TO A

1196
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
CABINET POSITION WAS THE

1197
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
LATE JOHN TOWER WHEN GEORGE

1198
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
H.W. BUSH APPOINTED HIM TO

1199
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
BE DEFENSE SECRETARY.

1200
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
HE WAS DEFEATED.

1201
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
SO MOST SENATORS GET THE

1202
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
JOBS WHEN THEY'RE NOMINATED.

1203
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I THINK JOHN KERRY WOULD NOT

1204
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
BE AN EXCEPTION.
JON: WHAT ABOUT THE

1205
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
CRITICISM THAT, YOU KNOW,

1206
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
CAME UP DURING HIS

1207
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN?

1208
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
THIS WAS A YOUNG MAN WHO

1209
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
WENT TO SITE IN VIETNAM.

1210
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
HE CAME HOME AND SPOKE OUT

1211
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
STRONGLY AGAINST THE VIETNAM

1212
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
WAR AND ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE

1213
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
CONDUCT OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS

1214
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
THERE.
IS THAT GOING TO BEDEVIL

1215
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
HIM?
>> I THINK IT WILL IN SOME

1216
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
QUARTERS.

1217
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I THINK IT WILL BE RAISED.

1218
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER

1219
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
SENATORS THEMSELVES OR HOW

1220
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
MANY OF THEM WILL HAVE THE

1221
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
REAL STOMACH TO DO THAT

1222
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
BECAUSE THEY WILL SAY TO

1223
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
THEMSELVES, WELL, YOU KNOW,

1224
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
THAT WAS VETTED BEFORE.

1225
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
HE IS NOT RUNNING FOR

1226
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
PRESIDENT.
HE IS RUNNING TO BE, TO WORK

1227
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
FOR ANOTHER PRESIDENT.

1228
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I THINK SOME OF THE OTHER

1229
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
THINGS WILL COME UP THOUGH.

1230
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
JOHN KERRY'S VIEWS ON SYRIA

1231
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
WHERE HE SAID WE COULD DEAL

1232
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
WITH BASHAR ASSAD

1233
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
PREVIOUSLY.

1234
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
WANTED TO HAVE ACCOMMODATION

1235
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
WITH HIM.
NOW WE KNOW THAT IS TOTALLY

1236
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
WRONG.
YOU WILL SEE SOME OF THOSE

1237
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
ISSUES VET THE BUT I DON'T

1238
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
KNOW HOW MUCH THE SENATE

1239
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
REALLY WANTS TO FIGHT AGAIN

1240
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
OVER VIETNAM.

1241
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
JON: WHAT ABOUT FOREIGN

1242
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
POLICY, LET'S SAY HE GETS

1243
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
THE JOB AS JOHN KERRY

1244
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE.
WHAT DO YOU SEE HAPPENING?

1245
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
>> I DON'T SEE MUCH

1246
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT
WE'VE SEEN.

1247
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
THIS ADMINISTRATION RUNS

1248
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
FOREIGN POLICY MOSTLY OUT OF

1249
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
THE WHITE HOUSE.

1250
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
IT HAS FOR FOUR YEARS.

1251
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I THINK IT WOULD FOR ANOTHER

1252
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
FOUR YEARS.
JOHN KERRY WOULD BE ABLE TO

1253
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
ADVISE AT THE MARGINS, MAYBE

1254
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
SOMEWHAT LESS HAWKISHLY THAN

1255
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
HILLARY CLINTON HAS, BELIEVE

1256
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
IT OR NOT.

1257
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
HE IS VERY RELUCTANT TO

1258
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
INTERVENE OVERSEAS, FOR

1259
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
EXAMPLE.

1260
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
MILITARILY HE LIKES TO DEFER

1261
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
TO THE UNITED NATIONS.

1262
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
IN THAT SENSE NOT MUCH OF A

1263
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
CHANGE FROM BARACK OBAMA.

1264
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
>> VERY QUICKLY ON THE

1265
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
POLITICAL CALCULATION THOUGH,

1266
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
THE WHITE HOUSE GENERALLY

1267
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
WOIP THINK ABOUT NOMINATING

1268
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
A SENATOR IF THEY DIDN'T

1269
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
FEEL THEY COULD GET ANOTHER

1270
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
DEMOCRAT TO REPLACE HIM.

1271
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
WHAT ABOUT SCOTT BROWN

1272
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
RUNNING TO REPLACE, WELL,

1273
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
SECRETARY KERRY IF HE IS

1274
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
CONFIRMED?

1275
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
>> THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE

1276
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
WHITE HOUSE'S CALCULATIONS.

1277
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
DO THEY WANT TO TAKE THAT

1278
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
RISK OF AN OPEN SEAT.

1279
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
IF SCOTT BROWN RAN, HE WOULD

1280
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
HAVE A VERY GOOD SHOT

1281
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
WINNING AGAIN.

1282
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
THAT MIGHT BE PART OF THEIR

1283
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
CALCULATION.

1284
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY

1285
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
STILL HAVE A FIVE-SEAT

1286
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
MAJORITY.

1287
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
THEY WOULD STILL HAVE A

1288
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
FOUR-SEAT MAJORITY EVEN IF

1289
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
THEY LOST THAT SEAT.

1290
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
JON: INTERESTING, PAUL.

1291
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.

1292
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
JON: YOU CAN CATCH PAUL

1293
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000

BRAND NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN

HOURS AGO, WHEN A GUNMAN

BUT AGAIN, A VERY CHAOTIC

1383

00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
WERE ANY STUDENTS INJURED.

1487
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
FALLWELL SHORT OF TORTURE.

1488
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
JENNA: CAN YOU GIVE US AN

1489
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
EXAMPLE.
>> SLEEP DEPRIVATION UNDER

1490
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
CONTROLLED CIRCUMSTANCES.

1491
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
TEMPERATURE CONTROL.

1492
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
AUDIO ISSUES.

1493
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
STRESSED POSITIONS.
PART OF THIS IS THAT WE

1494
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
ALREADY RELEASED SO MUCH

1495
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT

1496
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
PROGRAM.
JENNA: YOU BRING US TO A

1497
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
LARGER POINT HIRE.
THIS IS JUST ONE REPORT BUT

1498
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU

1499
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CIA

1500
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
HOW IT OPERATES NOW AND HOW

1501
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
IT DOES ITS JOB WHICH IS

1502
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
ULTIMATELY TO PROTECH THE

1503
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

1504
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH

1505
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
HAPPENED IN THE LAST 10

1506
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
YEARS BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT

1507
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
THAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST

1508
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
SEVERAL MONTHS, WITH LIBYA,

1509
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
WITH THE PETRAEUS SCANDAL AS

1510
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
WELL.
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS PLAYS

1511
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
INTO THE ACTUAL WORK THAT

1512
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
THE CIA NEEDS TO ACCOMPLISH

1513
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
ON A DAILY BASIS?

1514
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
>> RIGHT.
WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE

1515
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
THREATS TO AMERICA FROM

1516
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
TERRORISM HAVE ENDED.

1517
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF

1518
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
THAT GROUND SWELL FOR A

1519
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
WHILE.

1520
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
PEOPLE REALIZED, NO, THAT IS

1521
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
NOT THE CASE.
THERE ARE STILL HOSTILE

1522
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
ELEMENTS OUT THERE THAT

1523
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
SPEND THEIR DAYS FIGURING

1524
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
OUT HOW TO ATTACK US AND OUR

1525
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
ALLIES.
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ENHANCED

1526
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
TECHNIQUES, WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT TAKING THAT OFF THE

1527
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
TABLE, AND THE AGGRESSIVE

1528
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
INTEAR GRADUATION TECHNIQUES

1529
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
WERE STOPPED BY BUSH

1530
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
ADMINISTRATION.
IT HAPPENED YEARS AGO.

1531
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
IT IS PRETTY CLEAR TO OUR

1532
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
ENEMIES OVERSEAS WHAT IT IS

1533
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
WE CAN AND CAN'T DO.

1534
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
JENNA: HOW DOES THAT AFFECT

1535
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
OUR ABILITY TO PROTECH THE

1536
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
COUNTRY?

1537
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
WHAT HAVE WE REALLY LEARNED,

1538
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
IF WE TAKE INDEPENDENT OF

1539
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
THIS REPORT, WHAT HAVE WE

1540
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
LEARNED?

1541
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
ARE WE BETTER OFF?

1542
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
>> WE ARE BETTER OFF BECAUSE

1543
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
WE UNDERSTAND THE ENEMY

1544
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
MORE.
WE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS OVER

1545
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
THE YEARS TAKING OUT A LOT

1546
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
OF THEIR KEY PERSONNEL.

1547
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
THEY HAVE ALMOST SEEMS LIKE

1548
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
BOTTOMLESS POOL OF POTENTIAL

1549
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
RECRUITS.

1550
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT, ARE

1551
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
WE BETTER OFF?

1552
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE

1553
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
THIS REPORT, RIGHT?

1554
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
HOW LONG IS A PIECE OF

1555
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
STRING?

1556
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
PEOPLE SAY TECHNIQUES, I

1557
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
KEEP WANTING TO GO BACK TO

1558
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
THE REPORT, THESE TECHNIQUES

1559
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
DIDN'T WORK.
IT IS INANE TO SAY THEY

1560
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
DIDN'T WORK EVER.

1561
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
THE REALITY IS, ALWAYS A

1562
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED.

1563
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
THE REALITY IS, SOMETIMES

1564
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
ENHANCED TECHNIQUES WORK,

1565
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T.

1566
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
WHAT WE DID THOUGH IN OUR

1567
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
RUSH TO SHOW HOW RIGHTEOUS

1568
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
WE ARE DURING THIS PROCESS

1569
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
WAS WE TOOK THEM COMPLETELY

1570
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
OFF THE TABLE.

1571
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
WE REMOVED THE ELEMENT OF

1572
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
SURPRISE FROM THE KIT BAG.

1573
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
WHETHER YOU USE THEM OR NOT,

1574
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
YOU DON'T TELL THE ENEMY

1575
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T DO.

1576
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
WHAT WE DID --.

1577
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
JENNA: WHAT IS THE DAMAGE
FOR THAT?

1578
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
>> THE DAMAGE IS, GOING

1579
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
FORWARD AND GOING FORWARD

1580
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
FOR QUITE SOME TIME EVER

1581
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
SINCE THE OBAMA

1582
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
ADMINISTRATION SAID ALL WE

1583
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
COULD DO WITH WHAT IS ARMY

1584
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
FIELD MANUAL, I COULDN'T

1585
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
BREAK MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER

1586
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
WITH THE ARMY FIELD MANUAL.

1587
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
YOU ADVISE THOSE IN THE

1588
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
FUTURE WHO WORK AGAINST US

1589
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
IF WE PICK THEM UP OFF THE

1590
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
BATTLEFIELD THEY THOUGH
EXACTLY WHAT WE CAN AND

1591
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
CAN'T DO.
THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE IS

1592
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
IMPORTANT IN THE

1593
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
INTERROGATION PROCESS.
JENNA: AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO

1594
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000

THAT SCHOOL WHERE NINE: 40

1612
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
THIS MORNING A GUNMAN WALKED

1613
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
IN TO THE SCHOOL AND

REPORTED TO BE DEAD.
YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE CARRYING

1621
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000

1623
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000

WHAT CHILDREN SAW OR HEARD

1625
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
WE DO NOT YET KNOW.

1626
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
PARENTS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO

1627
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
STAY AWAY.

1628
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
THE CHILDREN WERE TAKEN OUT

1629
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
INTO THE PARKING LOT AFTER

1630
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
THE SHOTS RANG OUT.

1631
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000

1632
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000

1633
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000

00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
YOU HAVE STUDENTS, THEY ARE

1852
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
TEXTING, TWEETING ON

1853
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
FACEBOOK.
THERE IS LOT OF

1854
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
COMMUNICATION RIGHT AWAY.

1855
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
WE HAVE TO REMIND OUR

1856
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
VIEWERS THESE ARE LITTLE

1857
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
KIDS, KINDERGARTEN THROUGH

1858
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
FOURTH GRADE.

1859
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
JENNA: AT THIS SCHOOL.

1860
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
THAT DEFINITELY AFFECTS

1861
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
INFORMATION.
JON YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR

1862
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
THE MAYOR AS WELL.

1863
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
JON: PART OF THE FRUSTRATION

1864
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
FOR PARENTS, THE POLICE HAD

1865
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
TO SWEEP THE SCHOOL AND

1866
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
INSURE THERE IS NO OTHER

1867
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
DANGER.

1868
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
HAS THAT BEEN COMPLETED AT

1869
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
THIS POINT AS FAR AS YOU

1870
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
KNOW?
>> THEY'RE STILL WORKING ON

1871
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
A SWEEP.

1872
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
THAT IS THE CORRECT

1873
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
PROTOCOL.

1874
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
THAT IS DRILLED WITH EACH

1875
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
POLICE DEPARTMENT ON THE

1876
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
AREA.
THERE ARE MAPS OF EVERY

1877
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
SCHOOL, CLOSET, BUILDING.

1878
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
THEY TAKE A VERY, PRAGMATIC

1879
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
APPROACH AND GO THROUGH EACH

1880
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
OF THEIR OWN CLASS TO --

1881
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
PLACE IS SECURE.
SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,

1882
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
THEY'RE WORKING ON THAT RIGHT

1883
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
NOW, AND THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE

1884
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
PROCEDURE GOING FORWARD.

1885
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
JON: SOME OF THE EARLY REPORTS

1886
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
SUGGESTED THERE MIGHT BE

1887
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
MULTIPLE GUNMEN.

1888
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING TO VERIFY

1889
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
THAT, OR ARE WE JUST TALKING

1890
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
ABOUT ONE SHOOTER HERE WHO IS

1891
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
DEAD?
>> I'VE HEARD THAT SAME REPORT.

1892
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION

1893
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
THAT WOULD EITHER CONFIRM, YOU

1894
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
KNOW, OR DISPEL THAT REPORT AT

1895
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
THIS TIME.

1896
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
IT'S AN ACTIVE, VERY ACTIVE

1897
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
INVESTIGATION.
STATE POLICE TAKE THE LEAD ALONG

1898
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
THE NEWTOWN POLICE DEPARTMENT

1899
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
AND, OBVIOUSLY, OUR POLICE

1900
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
DEPARTMENT'S PROVIDING ANY HELP

1901
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
NECESSARY.

1902
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
JENNA: WE'VE HEARD THAT SOME OF

1903
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
THE FAMILIES ARE BEING TOLD TO

1904
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
GO TO A LOCAL FIREHOUSE.

1905
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
>> YEP.

1906
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
JENNA: CAN YOU GIVE US A STATUS

1907
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
REPORT, HAVE FAMILIES BEEN

1908
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
REUNITED WITH THEIR CHILDREN, OR

1909
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
IS IT STILL A PROCESS OF THEM

1910
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
GOING RIGHT NOW?
>> IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

1911
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
MOST OF THE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN

1912
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
REUNITED WITH FAMILIES.

1913
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
THEY HAD, AGAIN, MY HAT GOES OFF

1914
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
TO NEWTOWN.

1915
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
THEY DID A TREMENDOUS JOB IN

1916
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
MANAGING A VERY DIFFICULT

1917
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
SITUATION.
THEY HAD, YOU KNOW, A PLAN IN

1918
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
PLACE, AN EVACUATION PLAN IN

1919
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
PLACE, AND THEY FOLLOWED IT TO

1920
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
THE T, IT WORKED.

1921
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
THEY WERE ABLE TO HOLD THE

1922
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
STUDENTS AND PROTECT THE

1923
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
STUDENTS WHILE THIS CATASTROPHIC

1924
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
EVENT WAS GOING ON, AND I'M

1925
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
PRETTY SURE EVERYBODY'S BEEN

1926
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
REUNITED IN TERMS OF CHILDREN

1927
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
AND FAMILIES.

1928
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
JENNA: I'M GETTING SOME MORE

1929
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
BREAKING NEWS INTO OUR NEWSROOM

1930
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
FROM YOUR LOCAL NEWSPAPER, THE

1931
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
HARTFORD CURRENT, THAT SAYS THAT

1932
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE INSIDE

1933
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
THE KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM.

1934
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT FOR US?

1935
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
>> I CANNOT.

1936
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
JENNA: OKAY.

1937
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
MR. MAYOR, WHAT DO YOU THINK'S

1938
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
IMPORTANT FOR YOU AS WE TAKE A

1939
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
LOOK AT THIS COMMUNITY, AGAIN, A

1940
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
K-4 SCHOOL, NEARLY 700 STUDENTS.

1941
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
HAVE YOU EVER HAD SOMETHING LIKE

1942
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
THIS HAPPEN BEFORE IN THE

1943
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
COMMUNITY?

1944
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
>> YOU KNOW, THIS IS A VERY

1945
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
QUIET, PEACEFUL AREA OF THE

1946
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
COUNTRY.
NO, WE HAVEN'T.

1947
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
BUT I WILL SAY THAT THERE'S A

1948
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
REASON WHY WE HAVE ALL THESE

1949
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLANS AND

1950
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
THEY WORK, AND THIS IS THE

1951
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
REASON WHY WE EVEN DRILL WITH

1952
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
KINDERGARTEN STUDENTS ABOUT HOW

1953
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
TO EVACUATE THE BUILDING

1954
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
APPROPRIATELY.
THIS IS WHY.

1955
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
SO WITH THE RIGHT PLANNING, WE

1956
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
AVOIDED WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN AN

1957
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
EVEN WORSE, CATASTROPHIC EVENT

1958
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
THAN WE HAVE HERE, AND THE

1959
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
PARENTS CAN FEEL COMFORT THAT

1960
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
THE GREATER COMMUNITY HAVE A

1961
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
PLAN, THE KIDS KNOW THAT, AND IT

1962
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
PAYS OFF WHEN YOU HAVE AN AWFUL

1963
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
SITUATION LIKER -- LIKE THIS.

1964
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
JENNA: MR. MAYOR, YOU'VE BEEN

1965
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
MOST GRACIOUS WITH YOUR TIME

1966
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
DURING A VERY DIFFICULT

1967
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
SITUATION.

JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS, RIGHT IN

1980

THE MIDDLE OF HANUKKAH AND THEN

1981
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
THIS HAPPENS ON A BEAUTIFUL

1982
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
FRIDAY MORNING OUTSIDE DANBURY,

1992
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000

01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000

01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM.

2001
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
ACCORDING TO A MAYOR FROM

REPORT THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE

FATALITIES.
WE DO NOT KNOW THE IDENTITIES,

01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
WE DO NOT KNOW THE AGE.

2011
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
THESE ARE CERTAINLY DEVELOPMENTS

2012
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
AND DETAILS THAT WILL TRANSPIRE

2013
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS.

01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF RESPONSE

THEY WANT TO TALK TO ANYONE WHO

2085
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000

PICTURES ARE HAVING A LITTLE

2092
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000

01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
INCLUDING OUR AMBASSADOR.

2393
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
SECRETARY OF STATE CLINTON WAS

2394
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
EXPECTED TO FACE THE HOUSE

2395
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE NEXT

2396
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
WEEK, BUT NOW THE STATE

2397
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
DEPARTMENT IS SAYING MAYBE NOT.

2398
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT

2399
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
CATHERINE HERRIDGE IS LIVE IN

2400
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
WASHINGTON WITH MORE DETAILS.

2401
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING.

2402
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
REALLY THREE KEY DEVELOPMENTS

2403
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
THIS MORNING, THE REPUBLICAN

2404
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
CHAIR OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE

2405
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
COMMITTEE HAS SAID HE BELIEVES

2406
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
THERE WAS, QUOTE, GROSS

2407
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
NEGLIGENCE ON BEHALF OF THE

2408
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
STATE DEPARTMENT FOR FAILING TO

2409
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE

2410
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
AMBASSADOR.

2411
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
AS WE FIRST REPORTED HERE ON

2412
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
FOX, THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY

2413
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
MEETING IN BENGHAZI, AND AT THAT

2414
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
MEETING THEY SENT A CABLE

2415
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
WARNING HILLARY CLINTON'S OFFICE

2416
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
IN WASHINGTON THAT THEY COULD

2417
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
NOT WITHSTAND A COORDINATED

2418
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
ATTACK AND THAT THERE WERE AT

2419
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
LEAST TEN ISLAMIST MILITIAS OR

2420
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
al-QAEDA GROUPS TRAINING IN

2421
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
BENGHAZI, AND THEY ASKED FOR

2422
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
MORE ASSISTANCE.

2423
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
THOSE REQUESTS WERE TURNED COULD

2424
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
BE AND -- TURNED DOWN AND, IN

2425
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
FACT, THE SECURITY PRESENCE WAS

2426
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
FURTHER DRAWN DOWN AFTER THAT

2427
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
EMERGENCY MEETING.
NUMBER TWO, THERE'S A BACK AND

2428
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
FORTH OVER THE APPEARANCE NEXT

2429
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
WEEK OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE.

2430
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
BOTH OF THE RELEVANT COMMITTEES

2431
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
ARE EXPECTING HER ON THURSDAY,

2432
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
THOUGH THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS

2433
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
SUGGESTING THAT THE DATE MAY

2434
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
SLIDE ARGUING THAT SHE IS NOT

2435
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
REQUIRED TO TESTIFY OR WOULD NOT

2436
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
ANTICIPATE TESTIFYING UNTIL THIS

2437
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
INTERNAL REVIEW CALLED AN

2438
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW BOARD OR

2439
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
ARB IS COMPLETE.

2440
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
AND THEN THE LAST DEVELOPMENT

2441
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
WHICH I THINK IS EXTREMELY

2442
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
SIGNIFICANT IS BASED ON THESE

2443
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
REGULATIONS.

2444
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
THESE REGULATIONS COVER THIS

2445
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
INTERNAL STATE DEPARTMENT

2446
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
INVESTIGATION.

2447
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
BASED ON THESE REGULATIONS,

2448
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY

2449
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
REQUIREMENT FOR THE COMPLETE,

2450
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
UNVARNISHED REPORT TO BE SENT TO

2451
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
CONGRESS WHEN IT'S COMPLETE.

2452
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
THERE ONLY APPEARS TO BE A

2453
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
REQUIREMENT FOR HILLARY CLINTON

2454
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
TO PROVIDE TO CONGRESS HER

2455
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
SUMMARY OR BULLET POINTS, IF YOU

2456
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
WILL, OF THAT REPORT, AND THAT

2457
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
HAS TO BE DONE WITHIN A 90-DAY

2458
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
PERIOD.
SO THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THERE

2459
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
WILL BE A MOVE BY CONGRESS TO

2460
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
SUBPOENA SECRETARY OF STATE

2461
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
CLINTON TO TESTIFY IF NECESSARY

2462
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
AND WHETHER THEY WILL PUSH FOR

2463
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
THE RESULT, UNVARNISHED REPORT

2464
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
IF NECESSARY.

2465
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
JENNA: CATHERINE, THANK YOU.

2466
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
JON: MORE ON THIS WITH

2467
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
REPUBLICAN SENATOR BOB CORKER.

2468
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
HE WAS OPPOSED TO AMBASSADOR

2469
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
RICE'S POSSIBLE NOMINATION AND

2470
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
JOINS US NOW.

2471
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
SO SHE HAS WITHDRAWN HER NAME

2472
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
FOR CONSIDERATION.

2473
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
DOES THAT IN ANY WAY CHANGE THE

2474
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT HAPPENED

2475
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
IN BENGHAZI, SENATOR?

2476
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
>> OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

2477
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I THINK CERTAINLY SUSAN RICE HAD

2478
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SECURITY.

2479
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I THINK MOST OF US JUST THOUGHT

2480
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
THAT SHE WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE

2481
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
OF A POLITICAL OPERATIVE THAN

2482
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
SHE WAS A PRINCIPAL AND HAD

2483
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
CONCERNS ABOUT HER SERVICE.

2484
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I NEVER THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO

2485
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
BE APPOINTED, BY THE WAY, OR AT

2486
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
LEAST I HAVEN'T FOR SOME TIME

2487
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
BECAUSE I THINK THE WHITE HOUSE

2488
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
WAS ABLE TO SEE THE RECEPTION

2489
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
THAT SHE GOT THERE.

2490
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
BUT, LOOK, BENGHAZI, I WAS ABLE

2491
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
TO YESTERDAY SEE THE FOOTAGE

2492
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
FROM THE DRONE AS FAR AS WHAT

2493
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
HAPPENED ON THE GROUND.

2494
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I WAS ABLE TO ALSO SEE FROM

2495
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
SECURITY CAMERAS THE GROUPS THAT

2496
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
WERE COMING IN.

2497
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I DO THINK THAT WE WILL

2498
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
CONTINUE -- THERE'S NO QUESTION

2499
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FORCE

2500
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
A LOOK AT THE SECURITY MEASURES

2501
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
THERE BECAUSE THE WAY FOLKS WERE

2502
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
ABLE TO COME INTO OUR COMPOUND

2503
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
WITH SUCH EASE IN AN AREA THAT

2504
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
IS TOTALLY CONTROLLED BY

2505
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
MILITIAS, I THINK, IS SOMETHING

2506
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
THAT EVERY AMERICAN WANTS US TO

2507
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
MAKE SURE WE PURSUE TO ITS END.

2508
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
AND I DO THINK SECRETARY CLINTON

2509
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
WILL END UP TESTIFYING, AND I

2510
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
HOPE THAT THE ARB IS READY FOR,

2511
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
READY THURSDAY FOR HER TO COME

2512
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
IN AND DO THAT.

2513
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECT,

2514
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
AND I THINK SHE WILL COME BEFORE

2515
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
US.

2516
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
JON: PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SAID
THESE WERE UNFAIR AND MISLEADING

2517
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
ATTACKS ON HIS U.N. AMBASSADOR

2518
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
AND SUGGESTED THAT THE POLITICS

2519
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
OF THE MOMENT PLAYED A ROLE

2520
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
HERE.

2521
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
>> YEAH.
JON: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?

2522
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
>> YEAH.

2523
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
WELL, I DO THINK THE POLITICS OF

2524
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
THE MOMENT PLAYED A ROLE, AND

2525
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
THEY PLAYED A ROLE WITH

2526
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
AMBASSADOR RICE COMING ON FIVE

2527
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
SUNDAY MORNING PROGRAMS AND

2528
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
ACTING VERY MUCH LIKE A

2529
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
POLITICAL OPERATIVE.

2530
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
AND I'VE TRIED TO MOVE ONIONED

2531
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
THAT, JON, AND -- MOVE BEYOND

2532
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
THAT, JON, AND SAY, LOOK, FIRST

2533
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
OF ALL, I WOULD HAVE GIVEN HER A

2534
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
FAIR HEARING.

2535
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I DO NOT THINK SHE WAS GOING TO

2536
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
BE CONFIRMED.

2537
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
IT WASN'T JUST THAT, IT WAS JUST

2538
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
HER NATURE.

2539
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
SHE JUST STRIKES MOST OF US WHO

2540
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
HAVE HAD CONTACT WITH HER

2541
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
THROUGH THE YEARS MORE AS A

2542
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
POLITICAL OPERATIVE.

2543
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
MOST OF US SEE THE OFFICE OF

2544
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
SECRETARY OF STATE AS SOMETHING

2545
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
THAT IS ALMOST A FIRST AMONG

2546
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
EQUALS.
WE WANT SOMEONE WHO IS

2547
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
INDEPENDENT.
WE KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO SUPPORT

2548
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
THE PRESIDENT, BUT WE WANT

2549
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
SOMEONE WHO WILL PULL THE

2550
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
PRESIDENT IN A DIRECTION THAT'S

2551
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY WHEN HE'S

2552
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
OFF BASE AND MAYBE PURSUING

2553
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
SOMETHING THAT POLITICALLY IS

2554
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
MAYBE GOOD FOR HIM BUT NOT GOOD

2555
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
FOR THE COUNTRY.

2556
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
WE WANT SOMEBODY MORE

2557
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
INDEPENDENT, AND I THINK MOST OF

2558
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
US FELT THAT SHE WAS NOT

2559
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
INDEPENDENT, MORE OF A POLITICAL

2560
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
OPERATIVE AND A LOYALIST, AND I

2561
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
THINK WE'D LIKE -- I KNOW WE

2562
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
WANT SOMEONE WHO, AGAIN, IS

2563
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
STEEPED IN THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT

2564
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
ISSUES AROUND THE WORLD, BUT IS

2565
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
GOING TO BE INDEPENDENT ENOUGH

2566
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
TO PULL THE PRESIDENT IN THE

2567
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
RIGHT DIRECTION WHEN HE'S OFF

2568
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
BASE.

2569
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
JON: ALL INDICATIONS ARETHE FROW

2570
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
SENATOR, JOHN KERRY.

2571
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
WOULD YOU SUPPORT HIM?

2572
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
>> LOOK, I HATE TO SAY ANYTHING

2573
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
GOOD, JON, ABOUT ANYBODY BECAUSE

2574
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
IT MAY BE BAD FOR THEM --

2575
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
[LAUGHTER]
BUT I DO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,

2576
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
JOHN KERRY -- I MEAN, IT APPEARS

2577
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
THAT HE MAY BE THE PERSON.

2578
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I THINK HE WOULD BE CONFIRMED

2579
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
QUICKLY.

2580
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I THINK PEOPLE DO VIEW JOHN

2581
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
KERRY AS SOMEONE WHO IS A

2582
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
PRINCIPAL, DOES HAVE THAT

2583
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
INDEPENDENCE.

2584
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
OBVIOUSLY, HE WAS, HE WOULD

2585
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT, BUT I

2586
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
THINK HE HAS THE ABILITY TO PULL

2587
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
THINGS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

2588
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I WILL SAY THAT BEFORE ANYBODY

2589
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
COMES IN IN THAT POSITION, I DO

2590
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
HOPE WE'LL GET THIS BENGHAZI

2591
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
ISSUE BEHIND US.

2592
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON

2593
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
SECRETARY CLINTON TO COME CLEAN,

2594
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
TO ALLOW US TO KNOW EVERYTHING

2595
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
THAT'S HAPPENED AROUND THIS

2596
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
ISSUE.

2597
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
AND I THINK WE NEED TO GET THAT

2598
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
SWEPT UP AND CLEANED BEFORE WE,

2599
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
BEFORE WE START A NEW REGIME, IF

2600
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
WE WILL.

2601
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
JON: EVERYONE WANTS THOSE

2602
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
ANSWERS.

2603
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
REPUBLICAN SENATOR BOB CORKER OF

2604
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000

WE'RE LEARNING A LITTLE BIT MORE

2612
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
POTENTIALLY ABOUT THE SHOOTER IN

2613
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000

01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,000
AFTER THIS QUICK BREAK.

2621
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
JENNA: BACK WITH US NOW WITH

2622
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000

01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
NEWTON, CONNECTICUT.

01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
YOU'RE SEEING A LIVE SHOT OF THE

2625
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
WOODS, APPARENTLY, THIS IS

2626
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
PROBABLY BEHIND THE SCHOOL.

2627
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I'M STILL GETTING MORE

2628
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000

2629
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
SHOT -- WHAT THIS LIVE SHOT IS

2630
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
SHOWING US.
POLICE WERE OUT IN THIS AREA,

2631
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
AND THEY LOOKED LIKE,

2632
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
POTENTIALLY, THEY WERE SEARCHING

2633
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
FOR SOMETHING.
AND I THINK YOU CAN SEE SOME

2634
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
MOVEMENT IN THE CENTER OF YOUR

2635
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000

01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
MORE INFORMATION ON THAT SO WE

01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000

2638
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000

2639
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
THE INVESTIGATION.

2640
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
IN THE MEANTIME, I WANT TO BRING

2641
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
IN LISA.
HER DAUGHTER, LEAH, IS 8 YEARS

2642
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
OLD, A THIRD GRADER AT SANDY

2643
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
HOOK, AND LISA'S BEEN GRACIOUS

2644
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
ENOUGH TO JOIN US AND TELL US A

2645
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

2646
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
THIS MORNING, LISA.

2647
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOUR

2648
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
DAUGHTER TOLD YOU HAPPENED

2649
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
INSIDE THE SCHOOL?

2650
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
>> YES.
SHE WAS IN A, UM, A SMALL CLASS,

2651
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
A READING GROUP, AND THEY

2652
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,000
STARTED HEARING, UM, I GUESS

2653
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
BANGS, AND HER TEACHER -- WHICH

2654
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR -- THERE WAS

2655
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,000
JUST A SMALL GROUP, THEY RUSHED

2656
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
THE KIDS INTO THE BATHROOM, AND

2657
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
THEY LOCKED THE DOOR, AND THEY

2658
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
JUST TOLD THE CHILDREN THAT IT

2659
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,000
WAS HAMMERING AND TRIED TO KEEP

2660
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
THEM CALM.

2661
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,

2662
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD TO GET A

2663
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
COMPLETE STORY, THE NEXT THING I

2664
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
KNOW IS THAT, UM, THE POLICE

2665
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
CAME IN, AND THEY WERE KNOCKING

2666
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
ON THE DOOR TO BE LET OUT OF THE

2667
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
CLASSROOM, AND WHEN THEY WERE,

2668
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
SHE HAD SEEN GLASS AND BLOOD.

2669
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
ONE CHILD WAS COVERED IN BLOOD,

2670
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT CHILD IS

2671
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
SAFE AND WAS NOT HURT.

2672
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY

2673
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
ELSE'S.

2674
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
JENNA: WE'RE HEARING SOME

2675
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
DIFFERENT REPORTS ABOUT THE
INJURIES AND FATALITIES AND

2676
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
STILL TRYING TO LEARN MORE

2677
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
INFORMATION AS WE CAN TO BRING

2678
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
THAT TO OUR VIEWERS AND EVERYONE

2679
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
THAT'S WATCHING AND LISTENING

2680
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
RIGHT NOW, LISA.

2681
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A

2682
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
PARENT?

2683
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
WHEN KID YOU FIRST -- WHEN DID

2684
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
YOU FIRST HEAR OF SOMETHING

2685
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
HAPPENING AT THE SCHOOL, AND

2686
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?

2687
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
>> WELL, I WAS -- IT WAS FUNNY,

2688
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
BECAUSE I WAS ON MY COMPUTER,

2689
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
AND, UM, I GET BREAKING NEWS,

2690
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
AND THEY WERE -- THE SCHOOLS

2691
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
WERE ON LOCKDOWN BECAUSE OF A

2692
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
SHOOTING IN SANDY HOOK.

2693
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
AND WHEN I THINK BACK, I THOUGHT

2694
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
IT WAS THE TOWN.

2695
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, I GET

2696
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
A CALL FROM CARRIE SUMMERS, HER

2697
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
READING TEACHER, WHO IS MY HERO

2698
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
RIGHT NOW.
I CAN'T THANK HER ENOUGH FOR

2699
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
CALLING ME AND TELLING ME THAT

2700
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
MY DAUGHTER WAS SAFE AND AT THE

2701
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
FIREHOUSE.

2702
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
SO THEY BROUGHT THE CHILDREN

2703
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
FROM THE SCHOOL, THE MAJORITY OF

2704
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
THEM, TO THE FIREHOUSE, AND

2705
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
THEY --

2706
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
JENNA: AND WHAT WAS THE SCENE

2707
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
LIKE THERE?

2708
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
>> CHAOTIC, CHAOTIC.

2709
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
ALL I KNOW IS THAT, UM, I HAD

2710
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
CHILDREN CRYING, AND I KNEW

2711
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
THEIR PARENTS, SO I CALLED THEM

2712
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
ON THEIR CELL, AND ONE PARENT

2713
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
WAS SCARED ABOUT HER FIRST

2714
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
GRADER.
SHE COULDN'T FIND -- SO I LOOKED

2715
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
FOR A TEACHER, AND I COULD NOT

2716
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
FIND, AND I KNOW I THINK THIS

2717
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
THIS HAPPENED HA IN FIRST GRADE.

2718
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
JENNA: WE'RE HEARING A FEW

2719
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
DIFFERENT REPORTS.

2720
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
SOME ARE SUGGESTING THE

2721
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, SOME ARE

2722
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
SUGGESTING THE KINDERGARTEN

2723
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
CLASS.
AS YOU MENTIONED, MAYBE THE

2724
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
FIRST GRADE.

2725
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
>> YEAH, I HEARD FIRST GRADE.

2726
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
JENNA: HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING

2727
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
ELSE?

2728
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
I KNOW THAT THE PARENTS ARE

2729
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
PROBABLY TRYING TO COMPARE NOTES

2730
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENED,

2731
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
WHO DID IT.

2732
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING LIKE

2733
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
THAT?
>> NO, I HAVE NO IDEA.

2734
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I'M WATCHING THE NEWS NOW, AND

2735
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
IT'S SAYING THAT THE GUNMAN'S

2736
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
DEAD, AND THE PRINCIPAL MAY HAVE

2737
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
BEEN SHOT, AND THERE WAS A WOMAN

2738
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
WITH ALSO SHOT IN THE LEG, BUT I

2739
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
DON'T KNOW.

2740
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
JENNA: WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THAT

2741
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
AS WELL, BUT WE APPRECIATE THAT

2742
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN ONE OF THOSE

2743
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
SITUATIONS THAT'S BEEN SO

2744
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
CHAOTIC, AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING

2745
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
TO PIECE IT TOGETHER FOR OUR

2746
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
VIEWERS.

2747
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
HOW IS LEAH DOING RIGHT NOW IN.

2748
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
>> SHE'S FINE.

2749
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT SHE

2750
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
TOTALLY GETS IT, BUT SHE DID

2751
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
SEE, YOU KNOW, HER -- MORE THAN

2752
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I WOULD HAVE LIKED HER TO SEE.

2753
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
SHE DID TELL ME ABOUT A LITTLE

2754
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
BOY THAT WAS IN A POLICE

2755
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
OFFICER'S ARM, AND HE WAS

2756
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
BLEEDING.
SO -- BUT I DON'T KNOW IF SHE

2757
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
GETS IT OR --

2758
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
JENNA: YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE

2759
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
MAYORS FROM THE NEIGHBORING

2760
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
TOWN, MAYOR BOWDEN, JOINED US

2761
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
AND SAID THE SCHOOLS IN THE AREA

2762
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
REALLY PRACTICE THIS.

2763
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
HAS YOUR DAUGHTER BEEN IN THE

2764
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
SCHOOL SINCE KINDERGARTEN?

2765
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
HAD THEY PRACTICED THE DRILLS,

2766
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
EVACUATION PROCEDURES?

2767
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
>> I BELIEVE SO.

2768
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
IT'S A SAFE SCHOOL, AND I CAN'T

2769
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT

2770
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
TEACHERS AND THE STAFF.

2771
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
UM, YOU KNOW, IF ANYBODY -- IT

2772
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
WOULD BE SANDY HOOK SCHOOL THAT

2773
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
HAS IT DOWN RIGHT BECAUSE,

2774
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
AGAIN, IT'S THE BEST SCHOOL THAT

2775
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
YOU CAN -- I'M GRATEFUL FOR MY

2776
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
KIDS TO GO THERE.

2777
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
JENNA: HAVE THE TEACHERS OR

2778
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
AUTHORITIES GIVEN YOU ANY

2779
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
GUIDANCE OF WHAT TO DO NEXT?

2780
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
>> NO.

2781
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
JENNA: HAVE THEY SAID THEY'RE

2782
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
GOING TO TALK TO YOUR DAUGHTER?

2783
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
>> NO.
I'M STILL IN A STATE OF SHOCK,

2784
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
SO I DON'T KNOW THE NEXT STEP.

2785
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
I DON'T KNOW.

2786
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
JENNA: IF YOU COULD JUST STAND

2787
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
BY WITH US FOR ONE MOMENT, LISA,

2788
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
BUT

2789
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GETTING

2790
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WE

2791
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
WERE SEEING ON THE SCREEN THERE

2792
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:57,000
WITH THE WOODS, JON?

2793
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
JON: ONE -- I WOULD JUST SAY,

2794
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
JENNA, THAT ONE PARENT TOLD

2795
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
AUTHORITIES SAID SHE HEARD TWO

2796
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
BIG BANGS AT THE TIME OF THIS

2797
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
SHOOTING.

2798
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL,

2799
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
THE DEPARTMENT OF ALCOHOL,

2800
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
TOBACCO AND FIREARMS IS ON THE

2801
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
SCENE.
THEY HAVE RECOVERED MORE THAN

2802
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
ONE FIREARM AND, AGAIN, WE WERE

2803
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
TOLD THAT THE SHOOTER WALKED IN

2804
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
WITH AT LEAST TWO WEAPONS.

2805
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
BUT WHETHER THERE IS STILL AN

2806
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
ACTIVE SEARCH UNDERWAY FOR A

2807
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
SECOND GUNMAN, THAT'S THE

2808
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
QUESTION, AND THAT MAY HAVE

2809
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT

2810
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
HELICOPTER AERIAL SHOT OF THE

2811
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
WOODS OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.

2812
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
IT IS A FAIRLY WOODED AREA.

2813
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
IT'S 60 MILES TO THE NORTH AND

2814
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
EAST OF NEW YORK CITY AND NOT

2815
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
HEAVILY POPULATED.

2816
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
THERE YOU CAN SEE IT APPEARS TO

2817
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
BE A SEARCH DOG LOOKING AROUND

2818
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
IN THAT AREA UNDER THAT TREE

2819
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
NEAR THE SCHOOL.

2820
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
JENNA: BACK WITH LISA JUST FOR A

2821
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
MOMENT.
LISA, YOU SAID THIS IS JUST A

2822
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
SCHOOL YOU APPRECIATE THE

2823
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
TEACHERS AND LOVE THE EXPERIENCE

2824
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
THAT YOUR DAUGHTER HAS HAD SO

2825
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
FAR.
JUST IN GENERAL AS YOU REFLECT,

2826
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
AND I KNOW YOU'RE STILL IN A

2827
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
STATE OF SHOCK RIGHT NOW, WHAT

2828
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
IS NEXT FOR THE SCHOOL?

2829
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
DO YOU, DO YOU FORESEE RETURNING

2830
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
YOUR DAUGHTER TO CLASS ON

2831
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
MONDAY, OR IS THAT, AGAIN, STILL

2832
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
SOMETHING THAT'S UNKNOWN?
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW THE

2833
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
DETAILS, AND -- NOR DID I EVER

2834
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS

2835
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
EXPERIENCE.

2836
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
SO, AGAIN, I'M IN KIND OF,

2837
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
AGAIN, JUST I DON'T KNOW.

2838
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I DON'T KNOW.

2839
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
JENNA: WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT,

2840
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
AND I DON'T -- YOU KNOW, IT'S MY

2841
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
FAULT.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN AHEAD OF

2842
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
OURSELVES, BECAUSE IT'S STILL A

2843
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
SITUATION WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A

2844
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
LOT OF ANSWERS.

2845
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
LISA, I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE

2846
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
YOUR PERSPECTIVE, ESPECIALLY AS

2847
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
A MOTHER IN THE AREA.

2848
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE TIME.

2849
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

2850
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
JENNA: MORE ON THIS BREAKING

2851
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
NEWS OUT OF CONNECTICUT WHEN WE

2852
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
GET BACK.

2853
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:43,000
ANNCR: Some politicians seem to
think Medicare and...

2854
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Social Security are just numbers
in a budget.

2855
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Well, we worked hard for those
benefits.

2856
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
We earned them.

2857
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
And if Washington tries to cram
decisions about the future...

2858
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
of these programs into a last
minute budget deal...

2859
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
we'll all pay the price.

2860
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,000
AARP is fighting to protect
seniors with responsible...

2861
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
solutions that strengthen
Medicare and...

2862
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Social Security for generations
to come.

2863
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
We can do better than a last
minute deal...

2864
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,000
that would hurt all of us.

2865
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
JENNA: WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW

2866
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000

A COUPLE OF THINGS.

2875
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
THEY HAVE BROKEN DOWN IN JUST

2876
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
THE SHORT LITTLE WHILE, JENNA,

2877
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,000
THE TRY I CAN'T IMAGINE AREA --

2878
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
TRIAGE AREA.

2879
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
THE SECOND DEVELOPMENT IS COMING

2880
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000

ABC NEWS IS REPORTING THROUGH

2889
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000

PEOPLE POSSIBLY HAVE DIED TODAY

2892
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
HERE.

2893
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000

2896
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
HERE'S WHAT I CAN TELL YOU.

2897
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
THE ATF, THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL,

2898
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
TOBACCO, FIREARMS AND EXCLUSIVES

2899
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
IS THERE AT THE SCENE.

2900
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
THEY HAVE SENT SEVEN AGENTS FROM

THE ATF THERE TO THE SCHOOL IN

2902
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
CONNECTICUT.

2903
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
THE AGENTS FROM THE ATF HAVE

2904
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
REPORTEDLY COLLECTED FIREARMS.

2905
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000

01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
SO THAT WE KNEW WE HAD MULTIPLE

2910
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000

JENNA, WE KNEW EARLY ON IN THIS

2919
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
STORY THAT THIS WAS ANTICIPATED

2920
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000

2921
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
SHOOTING SCENE IN THIS

2922
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
CONNECTICUT STATE HISTORY.

2923

AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH

2924
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000

2926
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000

WE KNOW THE ATF IS PICKING THOSE

2932
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000

2933
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
CHILDREN AMONG THOSE INJURED,

2934
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
ACCORDING TO ABC NEWS, CHILDREN

2935
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
AMONG THOSE KILLED TODAY.

2936
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
A TERRIBLE SITUATION.

2937
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
A CODE REDDISH SHOED THROUGHOUT

2938
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
THE TOWN.

2939
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I KNEW THAT EARLIER FROM THE

2940
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY

2941
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
THERE ON THE GROUND IN NEWTOWN,

2942
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
CONNECTICUT.

2943
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
JENNA, JON?

2944
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
JENNA: HARRIS, THANK YOU VERY

2945
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
MUCH.
WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR WITH OUR

2946
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
VIEWERS, WE HAVE TWO MAJOR ITEMS

2947
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
CONFIRMED RIGHT NOW WHEN IT

2948
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
COMES TO THIS SCHOOL SHOOTING,

2949
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
AND THAT'S ABOUT IT.
WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A SCHOOL

2950
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
SHOOTING, AND WE KNOW THAT THE

2951
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
GOOD

2952
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
GUNMAN IS DEAD.

2953
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
AS FAR AS THE FATALITIES AND

2954
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
INJURIES, WE HAVE ZERO DETAILS

2955
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
ON THAT CONFIRMED.

2956
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
WE HOPE TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM

2957
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
THE STATE AND LOCAL POLICE IN,

2958
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
HOPEFULLY, AROUND TEN MINUTES,

2959
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
SO WE WANT TO GET THOSE NEWS

2960
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
ITEMS CONFIRMED TO YOU, BUT WE

2961
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
DO NOT WANT TO RUSH ANYTHING AT

2962
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
THIS TIME.

2963
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
IT'S SUCH A SENSITIVE STORY.

2964
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
A SHOOTING AT AN ELEMENTARY

2965
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
SCHOOL, K-4.

2966
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
NEARLY 700 STUDENTS THERE.

2967
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED AS WE HEAR

2968
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
MORE.

2969
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
JON: WELL, "HAPPENING NOW" TO

2970
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
ONE OF THE BIG POLITICAL STORIES

2971
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON, IT

2972
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR THE BLAME

2973
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
GAME TO START.
THIS AFTER AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE

2974
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
WITHDREW HER NAME FROM

2975
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
CONSIDERATION TO BECOME

2976
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
SECRETARY OF STATE.

2977
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
NBC'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT

2978
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
CHUCK TODD WAS QUICK TO BLAME

2979
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
WHAT HE CALLED CONSERVATIVE

2980
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
MEDIA.
LISTEN.

2981
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
>> THERE WERE LEGITIMATE

2982
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
QUESTIONS TO ASK ABOUT THE

2983
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
BENGHAZI STORY, BUT THE IDEA

2984
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
THAT SHE BELONGED IN THE CENTER

2985
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
OF THOSE ATTACKS NEVER MADE A

2986
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
LOT OF SENSE.

2987
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
SHE SORT OF BECAME A VICTIM OF

2988
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
THIS.

2989
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
JON: SO WHAT ABOUT THAT?

2990
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
FAIR?
LET'S CHECK IN WITH OUR NEWS

2991
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
WATCH PANEL, JUDITH MILLER, A

2992
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING

2993
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER AND

2994
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,000
KIRSTEN POWERS, A DAILY BEAST

2995
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
COLUMNIST.
I GUESS CHUCK TODD WOULD HAVE US

2996
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
BELIEVE THAT SUSAN RICE,

2997
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
AMBASSADOR RICE'S STATEMENTS ON

2998
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
THE MORNING SHOWS ABOUT WHAT

2999
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
HAPPENED IN BENGHAZI PLAYED NO

3000
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
ROLE WHATSOEVER IN HER DECISION

3001
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
TO WITHDRAW HER NAME FROM

3002
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
CONSIDERATION, JUDY.

3003
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
>> WELL, OF COURSE, THIS IS

3004
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
JUST -- IT'S LUDICROUS.

3005
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
CHUCK TODD HAS BEEN A GREAT

3006
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
DEFENDER OF SUSAN RICE, AND I

3007
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
HAVE BEEN VERY, VERY CRITICAL --

3008
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
AS YOU KNOW, JON AND KIRSTEN --

3009
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S HANDLING

3010
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
OF THE BENGHAZI DISASTER.

3011
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
BUT I WILL SAY THIS, THE

3012
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
RESPONSE TO SUSAN RICE, THE

3013
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,000
FOCUS ON HER, THE KILLING OF THE

3014
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
MESSENGER IS, AS JOE SCARBOROUGH

3015
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
HAS SAID, DISPROPORTIONATE.

3016
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
AND I FIND IT VERY UNUSUAL THAT

3017
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
THIS CAMPAIGN, THOUGH LED BY

3018
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
REPUBLICANS, WAS QUICKLY JOINED

3019
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
BY LIBERALS AND BY LEFT-WINGERS

3020
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
WHO ACCUSED SUSAN RICE OF BEING

3021
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
TOO COZY WITH AFRICAN DICTATORS.

3022
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
SHE WAS GETTING IT FROM ALL

3023
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
SIDES.
WHAT REALLY, REALLY OFFENDS ME

3024
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
IS THE PERSONAL NATURES OF THE

3025
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
ATTACKS ON HER BY JOURNALISTS

3026
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,000
WHO SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.

3027
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
MAUREEN DOWD CALLED HER TOO

3028
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
AMBITIOUS, TOO UNPRINCIPLED FOR

3029
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
THE COUNTRY.

3030
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
DANA MILL BANKS SAID THAT SHE

3031
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
HAD AN ATTITUDE PROBLEM.

3032
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
THIS KIND OF REACTION WAS

3033
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,000
TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE.
JON: KIRSTEN, WE ALSO HEARD FROM

3034
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
ANDREA MITCHELL WHO SAID THIS

3035
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
WAS NOT GOING TO HELP

3036
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
REPUBLICANS, FORCING A WOMAN OF

3037
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
COLOR OUT OF THE CONSIDERATION

3038
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
TO BECOME SECRETARY OF STATE.

3039
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
WHERE DOES THAT PLAY INTO ALL

3040
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
THIS?

3041
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
>> IT'S IRRELEVANT.

3042
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

3043
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
ANYTHING.

3044
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
FIRST OF ALL, WE'VE HAD A WOMAN

3045
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN SECRETARY OF

3046
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
STATE, YOU KNOW, A REPUBLICAN,

3047
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
ACTUALLY, WHO WAS CONFIRMED BY

3048
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE

3049
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
CRITICIZING SUSAN RICE.

3050
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
AND CAN, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT

3051
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
THE STORYLINE THAT SOMEHOW --

3052
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
AND THIS WAS WHAT SUSAN RICE

3053
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
SAID IN HER WITHDRAWAL -- WAS

3054
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
THAT SHE SOMEHOW GOT CAUGHT UP

3055
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
IN PARTISAN POLITICS ISN'T A

3056
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
TRUE STORY.

3057
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
BECAUSE AS JUDY JUST SAID, THERE

3058
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
WERE LIBERALS THAT CAME AFTER

3059
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
HER IN VERY PERSONAL TERMS.

3060
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
THE CRITICISMS FROM THE

3061
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
REPUBLICANS WERE ACTUALLY ABOUT

3062
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
BENGHAZI, AND, YOU KNOW, THE

3063
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
CRITICISMS FROM THE LEFT WERE

3064
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,000
MUCH MORE PERM, AND I THINK --

3065
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
PERSONAL, AND I THINK, WAS THE

3066
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
TURNING POINT.

3067
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I THINK IF THE LEFT HADN'T

3068
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
GOTTEN ON THE BANDWAGON, MAYBE

3069
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,000
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO

3070
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
WITHDRAW HER NAME.

3071
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
SO CLEARLY THE TIDE TURNED

3072
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,000
AGAINST HER WHEN YOU HAD A MAJOR

3073
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER COMING

3074
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
OUT AGAINST HER, FOR EXAMPLE.

3075
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
JON: WELL, AND ARE THE MEDIA

3076
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
REMEMBERING WHAT HAPPENED TO

3077
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
JOHN BOLTON --

3078
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
>> EXACTLY.

3079
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
JON: HE WAS GIVEN A RECESS

3080
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
APPOINTMENT, AND TRIED -- YOU

3081
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
KNOW, HIS NAME WAS SUBMITTED TO

3082
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
THE FULL SENATE FOR

3083
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
CONFIRMATION, BUT THAT WAS SHOT

3084
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
DOWN, JUDY.
NOBODY SEEMS TO REMEMBER THAT

3085
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
THERE WAS MOSTLY PARTISAN

3086
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
POLITICS INVOLVED IN THAT.

3087
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
>> I MEAN, IN THE HAS ALWAYS

3088
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
BEEN PARTISAN, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN

3089
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
POLITICAL.
NOMINEES OF MAJOR NATIONAL

3090
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
SECURITY OFFICIALS ARE NOT

3091
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
EXEMPT FROM POLITICS, BUT THEY

3092
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
SHOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THE KIND

3093
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
OF AD HOMINEM, PERSONAL, REALLY

3094
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
VICIOUS ATTACKS THAT WE SAW

3095
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
AGAINST SUSAN RICE.
IT WAS COMPLETELY UNCALLED FOR.

3096
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
THERE WERE REASONS TO OPPOSE HER

3097
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
ON POLICY GROUNDS.

3098
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
THE REPUBLICANS PRETTY MUCH

3099
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
STUCK TO THAT, AND I AGREE WITH

3100
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
KIRSTEN.

3101
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
IF THIS HADN'T BEEN JOINED BY

3102
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
THE LEFT, SHE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD

3103
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
TO WITHDRAW.

3104
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
JON: JUDY MILLER AND KIRSTEN

3105
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
POWERS, OUR NEWS WATCH PANEL,

3106
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.

3107
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
JENNA: ANY MOMENT NOW OUT OF

3108
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, WE EXPECT

3109
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
TO HEAR FROM STATE AND LOCAL

3110
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
OFFICIALS ABOUT WHAT TRANSPIRED

3111
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

3112
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
STILL TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER

3113
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
MULTIPLE REPORTS FROM A VARIETY

3114
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
OF SOURCES ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLY

3115
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
HAPPENED INSIDE THAT ELEMENTARY

3116
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
SCHOOL ABOUT THREE HOURS AGO.

3117
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
AGAIN, REPORTS THAT THERE ARE

3118
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,000
MULTIPLE FATALITIES, IDENTITY,

3119
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
AGE YET UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.

3120
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
WE WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH

3121
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
THESE REPORTS AS THEY COME INTO

3122
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
OUR NEWSROOM.

3123
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
WE DID HEAR FROM ONE PARENT JUST

3124
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
MOMENTS AGO, A PARENT OF AN

3125
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
8-YEAR-OLD IN THE A SCHOOL WHO

3126
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
SAID THAT HER TEACHER WAS ABLE

3127
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
TO GET THE LITTLE GIRL OUT BY

3128
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
HIDING AND LOCKING THEMSELVES IN

3129
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,000
THE BATHROOM AND THEN BEING ABLE

3130
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
TO ESCAPE.
JON?

3131
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:06,000
JON: LET'S ALSO TAKE YOU NOW TO

3132
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
WASHINGTON, D.C. WHERE JAY

3133
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
CARNEY IS HOLDING HIS DAILY

3134
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
BRIEFING, TALKING ABOUT THE
SUSAN RICE SITUATION.

3135
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
LET'S LISTEN IN.
>> SO AT THIS POINT I'D RATHER

3136
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
JUST INFORM YOU THAT THE

3137
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN INFORMED

3138
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
ABOUT THE SHOOTING, WAS INFORMED

3139
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
AT 10:30 AND IS BEING GIVEN

3140
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
REGULAR UPDATES AS MORE

3141
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

3142
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
>> WILL WE HEAR FROM HIM TODAY?

3143
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
>> YOU KNOW, WE'LL JUST HAVE TO

3144
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
KEEP YOU UPDATED AS MORE

3145
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

3146
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
>> TWO OTHER TOPICS.

3147
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
IN THE ABC NEWS INTERVIEW, THE

3148
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT THE

3149
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA IN A

3150
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
COUPLE OF STATES WHERE VOTERS

3151
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
SOUNDED OFF ON THAT AND

3152
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
ESSENTIALLY SAID THAT, UM, IT'S

3153
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
NOT A HIGH PRIORITY FOR HIM, NO

3154
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
PUN INTENDED, I GUESS, TO GO

3155
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
AFTER RECREATIONAL USERS.

3156
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
BUT, OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A

3157
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
SERIOUS ISSUE, STATES' RIGHTS

3158
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
VERSUS FEDERAL RIGHTS.

3159
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY

3160
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
CONCERN THAT THE PRESIDENT'S

3161
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
COMMENTS COULD SIGNAL THAT

3162
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
STATES, YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY TO

3163
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
GO AHEAD AND PURSUE YOUR OWN

3164
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
POLICIES ON MARIJUANA, WE'RE NOT

3165
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
GOING TO ENFORCE IT AT THE

3166
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
FEDERAL LEVEL?

3167
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
JON: ALL RIGHT, WE ARE -- AND MY

3168
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
APOLOGIES, I THOUGHT THAT JAY

3169
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
CARNEY WAS GOING TO BE TALKING

3170
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
ABOUT THE WITHDRAWAL OF SUSAN

3171
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
RICE FROM CONTENTION TO BE

3172
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
SECRETARY OF STATE.

3173
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
HE DID MENTION THAT THE
PRESIDENT WAS INFORMED ABOUT THE

3174
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
CONNECTICUT SCHOOL SHOOTING AND

3175
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
HAS BEEN STAYING ON TOP OF THE

3176
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
SITUATION.
HARRIS HAS BREAKING NEWS FOR US

3177
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
NOW.
>> Reporter: YEAH.

3178
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
THIS IS JUST COMING INTO OUR

3179
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
NEWSROOM.

3180
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
A HOSPITAL IN DANBURY,

3181
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
CONNECTICUT, WHICH IS NOT

3182
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
AWFULLY FAR FROM THE SCENE OF

3183
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,000
WHERE THE SHOOTING HAPPENED,

3184
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,000
ALMOST THREE HOURS AGO NOW, IN

3185
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, THAT

3186
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
HOSPITAL SPOKESPERSON SAYING

3187
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,000
THAT IT IS ON LOCKDOWN OUT OF AN

3188
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION AND TO

3189
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE

3190
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,000
PATIENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN TAKEN

3191
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
THERE.

3192
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,000
THEY HAVE ONLY THE NEEDED STAFF

3193
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
AT THAT HOSPITAL AT THIS POINT.

3194
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
THEY'VE SENT OTHERS AWAY.

3195
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
SO, BASICALLY, IF YOU ARE NOT

3196
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
ESSENTIAL TO SAVING LIVES AT

3197
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
THAT HOSPITAL, YOU'VE BEEN TOLD

3198
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
TO GO HOME.

3199
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
THEY HAVE ONLY TREATED THREE

3200
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
PATIENTS, THEY SAY REPORTEDLY.

3201
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
AGAIN, THIS IS THE HOSPITAL IN

3202
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
DANBURY, CONNECTICUT, NOT TOO

3203
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
FAR FROM THE SCENE IN WHICH

3204
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
YOU'RE.

3205
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
WATCHING LIVE ON THE SCREEN NOW,

3206
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
THAT'S NEWTOWN.

3207
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
THEY DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MORE

3208
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
PATIENTS TO BE TRANSPORTED TO

3209
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
THEIR HOSPITAL AT THIS TIME AND,

3210
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
OF COURSE, WE KNOW THIS, THEY

3211
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
ARE NOT RELEASING ANY SPECIFIC

3212
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
INFORMATION ABOUT PATIENT

3213
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
STATUS, SO ON AND SO FORTH.

3214
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
NO DISCUSSIONS THAT THEY'VE HAD

3215
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
WITH ANY OF THE FAMILIES.

3216
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I DO WANT TO CAUTION, JENNA SAID

3217
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
THIS EARLIER, JON, I THINK WE

3218
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
ALL HAVE, THAT AS INFORMATION

3219
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
COMES IN ON THIS STORY, WE HAVE

3220
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT REPORTING

3221
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,000
NUMBERS.

3222
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
WE HAVE SEEN A JUMP IN THE

3223
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,000
REPORTS ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE

3224
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
HAVE BEEN SHOT AND POSSIBLY

3225
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
KILLED TODAY.

3226
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
I CAN TELL YO FROM DIFFERENT

3227
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
SOURCES THE NUMBERS ARE ABOVE

3228
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
12.
SOME OF THEM HAVE THEM AS HIGH

3229
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
AS IN THE 20s AT THIS POINT.

3230
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
INJURIES AND FATALITIES.

3231
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,000
WE'RE WORKING HERE AT FOX NEWS

3232
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
TO SHORE THAT UP.

3233
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
WE WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE IN

3234
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
TELLING YOU WHAT WE CAN CONFIRM.

3235
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
WE ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU

3236
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
BECAUSE, OF COURSE, WE'RE IN THE

3237
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
WORLD OF TWITTER AND EVERYTHING

3238
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
ELSE, YOU MAY BE SEEING IT, THAT

3239
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
WE'RE SEEING THE SAME REPORTS.

3240
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
WE'RE CHASING THEM DOWN.

3241
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, THIS IS A

3242
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
HORRIBLE SCENE PLAYING OUT IN

3243
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

3244
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
BACK TO YOU GUYS.

3245
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
JON: AND AS YOU WERE JUST

3246
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
SPEAKING THERE, HARRIS, WE GOT

3247
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
SOME INFORMATION IN THAT AT

3248
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
LEAST FIVE CHILDREN ARE DEAD.

3249
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY OUR

3250
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
FOX NEWS PRODUCERS AND CONFIRMED

3251
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
BY TWO LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES,

3252
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
AT LEAST FIVE CHILDREN DEAD,

3253
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
FOUR ADULTS DEAD, AND THE

3254
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
NUMBER, AGAIN, AS HARRIS JUST

3255
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
MENTIONED, COULD GO HIGHER.

3256
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
THE ADULT GUNMAN IS ALSO DEAD.

3257
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
THE INITIAL REPORTS INDICATE HE

3258
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,000
DROVE TO THAT SCHOOL FROM NEW

3259
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
JERSEY.

3260
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
TWO HANDGUNS WERE RECOVERED FROM

3261
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
THE SCENE.

3262
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
THE STATUS, THE MOTIVE HERE

3263
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
STILL UNKNOWN, ABSOLUTELY NO

3264
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
INDICATION WHAT THE MOTIVE WAS

3265
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
ACCORDING TO ONE INVESTIGATOR.

3266
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE PIECED

3267
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
TOGETHER IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS

3268
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
TO COME.

3269
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
TEACHERS ARE BEING CALLED HEROES

3270
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
FOR THE WAY THEY RESPONDED,

3271
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
HAVING LOCKED THEIR CLASSROOM

3272
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
DOORS TO KEEP THE GUNMAN OUT.

3273
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
AND APPARENTLY, MANY OF THE

3274
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
FATALITIES TOOK PLACE, AS JENNA

3275
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
WAS SAYING EARLIER, IN A

3276
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM.

3277
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
JUST AN AWFUL SITUATION.

3278
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR A

3279
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
POLICE BRIEFING.

3280
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
THE NEWS CONFERENCE SET TO BEGIN

3281
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
IN 15 MINUTES OR SO, BUT

3282
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
OBVIOUSLY, IN A FLUID SITUATION

3283
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
LIKE THIS VERY OFTEN THOSE

3284
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
THINGS ARE POSTPONED.

3285
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,000
YOU CAN SEE THE BANK OF

3286
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
MICROPHONES THERE AT THE READY.

3287
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
JENNA: A FLUID SITUATION, JON,

3288
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,000
AS YOU JUST MENTIONED.

3289
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
STATE AND LOCAL FIRMS ARE

3290
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
INVOLVED.

3291
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
WE JUST HEARD FROM JAY CARPNY

3292
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS AWARE OF

3293
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
THIS SCHOOL SHOOTING AND IS

3294
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
RECEIVING REGULAR UPDATES ON IT.

3295
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FBI

3296
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
IS SUPPORTING STATE LAW
ENFORCEMENT AT LEAST AT THIS

3297
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
TIME.
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING ALONG

3298
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
WITH US FOR THE LAST SEVERAL

3299
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
HOURS HAS BEEN A VERY ORGANIZED

3300
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
CHAOS, IF YOU WILL.

3301
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
MANY RESPONDERS TO THE SCENE,

3302
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
MULTIPLE AMBULANCES, BUT AT THE

3303
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,000
SAME TIME WE'VE BEEN QUESTIONING

3304
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED

3305
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
WITH THE INJURIES AND

3306
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
FATALITIES.

3307
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,000
WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THAT

3308
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
NOW.
AS HARRIS MENTIONED, AS JON

3309
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
MENTION LD, WE'RE JUST GETTING

3310
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
INITIAL REPORTS AT THIS TIME

3311
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
THAT THERE ARE CHILDREN AMONG

3312
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
THE DEAD TO THE LEFT OF YOUR

3313
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
SCREAM, YOU SEE SOMEONE RUNNING.

3314
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
GUYS, IS THAT A LIVE SHOT?

3315
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,000
JUST TO BE CLEAR, WHAT YOU'RE

3316
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
SEEING BEHIND THE SCHOOL THERE

3317
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
WITH THE WOODED AREA, AS WE SAW

3318
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
ONE OF THE SCENES THAT SEEMED

3319
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
ACTIVE, SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT

3320
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
RUSHING INTO THIS FIELD IN THE

3321
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,000
BACK, AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO

3322
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
FIGURE OUT HOW THAT, THAT ADDS

3323
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
INTO THE INVESTIGATION.

3324
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,000
WERE THEY CONCERNED ABOUT AN

3325
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
ACCOMPLICE?
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE

3326
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
AT THIS TIME DESPITE SOME EARLY

3327
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
REPORTS.

3328
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,000
WHAT ABOUT THE WEAPONS?

3329
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
WE'RE HEARING MULTIPLE REPORTS,

3330
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
ONE BEING CONFIRMED THAT THERE

3331
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
WERE TWO GUNS AT THE SCENE, BUT

3332
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,000
WHAT ABOUT OTHER FIREARMS AS

3333
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
WELL?
AGAIN, A VERY DEVELOPING

3334
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
SITUATION THREE HOURS IN.

3335
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
WE DO KNOW THE SHOOTING TOOK

3336
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,000
PLACE 9:40 EASTERN TIME, RIGHT

3337
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
AS CLASSES GOT STARTED.

3338
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,000
JON: THERE ALSO WERE REPORTS

3339
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
THAT AUTHORITIES WERE STILL

3340
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
LOOKING FOR A SECOND VEHICLE

3341
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
THEY BELIEVED TO BE INVOLVED,

3342
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,000
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A BURR

3343
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,000
GANDHI VAN WITH A BLOWN-OUT BACK

3344
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,000
WINDOW.
WHETHER THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

3345
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
ANOTHER GUNMAN INVOLVED, AGAIN,

3346
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
IT SEEMED SPECULATIVE IN THE

3347
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
EARLY GOING, BUT THEY ARE

3348
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
APPARENTLY ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR

3349
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
A SECOND VEHICLE.

3350
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000

THEY ARE SAFE.

3370
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,000

3382
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
HARRIS FAULKNER WORKING THE

3383
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
STORY FROM OUR BREAKING NEWS

3384
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,000
DESK.

3385
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
AGAIN, WE HAVE BEEN TOLD TO

3386
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
EXPECT A POLICE NEWS CONFERENCE

3387
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES, BUT VERY

3388
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
OFTEN IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS

3389
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
THOSE THINGS GET PUSHED BACK AND

3390
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
BACK AND BACK.

3391
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
STILL A VERY CHAOTIC SITUATION

3392
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
EVEN AS RECENTLY AS, OH, HALF AN

3393
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
HOUR AGO OR PERHAPS A BIT MORE

3394
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,000
WHEN WE WERE SPEAKING TO THE

3395
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
MAYOR OF DANBURY, HE SAID THAT

3396
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
THE SWEEP OF THE SCHOOL WAS

3397
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
STILL UNDERWAY.

3398
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
POLICE GO IN IN A SITUATION LIKE

3399
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
THIS, THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE

3400
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
THAT THEY HAVE COVERED EVERY

3401
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
BASE AND CLEARED EVERY

3402
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,000
CLASSROOM, SO THEY HAVE A

3403
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
SIZABLE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THAT

3404
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
HOUSES NORMALLY ABOUT 600

3405
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
STUDENTS TO GO THROUGH, AND THEY

3406
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
WERE STILL UPSIDE WAY WITH THAT

3407
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,000
PROJECT -- UNDERWAY WITH THAT

3408
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
PROJECT WITHIN THE LAST HOUR.

3409
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,000
SO, AGAIN, WE HAVE IT CONFIRMED

3410
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST FIVE

3411
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,000
CHILDREN AND FOUR ADULTS WHO ARE

3412
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
DEAD IN THIS SITUATION, BUT THE

3413
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
NUMBER COULD GO HIGHER.

3414
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
JENNA: WE'RE ACTUALLY HEARING

3415
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
SOME CONFIRMATION THAT THE

3416
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
NUMBER PROBABLY IS HIGHER AT

3417
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
THIS TIME AND ALSO LEARNING A

3418
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE

3419
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
SHOOTER IN THIS SITUATION.

THAT THE SHOOTER WAS WEARING A

01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
MILITARY VEST.
THERE IS A POSSIBLE SECOND

3424
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,000
SHOOTER, BUT THAT IS NOT

3425
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
CONFIRMED AT THIS TIME.

3426
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000

01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000

01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,000
BE LOOKING FOR.

3432
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000

A MOMENT, WE CAN ALSO REPORT

HIS OWN LIFE OR WHETHER OR NOT

01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS INVOLVED, WE

3453
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
DO NOT KNOW.

3454

NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, IT

3466
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
CERTAINLY RANKS AS WITHIN OF THE

3467
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
WORST -- ONE OF THE WORST MASS

3468
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000

01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
BUT, AGAIN, THAT NUMBER COULD GO

3475
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
UP.

3476
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
THREE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO

3477
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
LOCAL HOSPITALS.

3478
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

3479
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
THEIR CONDITIONS.

3480
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
AGAIN, THE FACT THAT A

3481
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF

3482
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,000
INJURED WERE TAKEN AWAY IS, IN

3483
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
THIS SITUATION, NOT A GOOD SIGN.

3484
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
JENNA: WE FELT SOME COMFORT

3485
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,000
EARLIER ON WHEN WE WERE WATCHING

3486
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,000
THE LIVE SCENE AT THE TRIAGE

3487
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
MATS THAT WERE ON THE GROUND AND

3488
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,000
THINKING, WELL, MAYBE IF THERE'S

3489
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
NO ONE BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE

3490
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
BUILDING ON A STRETCHER, MAYBE

3491
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
THIS IS LIMITED IN SCOPE.

3492
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
AND WHAT WE'RE LEARNING NOW IS A

3493
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
VERY DIFFERENT PICTURE, INDEED.

3494
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
SO AGAIN, AS WE'RE REPORTING TO

3495
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,000
YOU, 26 DECEASED AT THIS TIME; 8

3496
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
ADULTS, 18 CHILDREN.
WHERE THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE IS

3497
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,000
STILL UNDONE FIRMED. --

3498
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
UNCONFIRMED.
WE HAVE HEARD DIFFERING REPORTS,

3499
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
ONE BEING THE PRINCIPAL'S

3500
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
OFFICE, ONE BEING THE

3501
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASS, THE OTHER

3502
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
THE FIRST GRADE.

3503
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
A PARENT JOINED US A FEW MINUTES

3504
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
AGO, HER THIRD GRADER WAS IN A

3505
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,000
READING CLASS, AND HER TEACHER

3506
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
TOLD THE CLASS THIS IS

3507
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
CONSTRUCTION WORK, THIS IS A

3508
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,000
HAMMER AND GOT THE STUDENTS INTO

3509
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
A BATHROOM AND LOCKED THE DOORS

3510
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
THERE.
THEY KEPT THAT DOOR LOCKED AND

3511
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
KEPT THE STUDENTS INSIDE THE

3512
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
BATHROOM UNTIL POLICE CAME AND

3513
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
TOOK THEM TO THE FIREHOUSE.

3514
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
THE SCENE THAT THEY DESCRIBE,

3515
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
THE YOUNG STUDENT, THE

3516
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
8-YEAR-OLD, SAYS SHE SAW

3517
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
SHATTERED GLASS IN THE BUILDING,

3518
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
SOME BLOOD AS WELL.

3519
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
SHE ALSO SAW A POLICE OFFICER

3520
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
CARRYING OUT WHAT LOOKED LIKE AN

3521
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
INJURED LITTLE BOY.

3522
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
THE STATUS OF THAT LITTLE BOY,

3523
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
HIS IDENTITY WE DON'T KNOW AT

3524
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
THIS TIME.
TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT FOR

3525
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
YOU AS WELL.

3526
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,000
JON: THE SHOOTER, WE'RE TOLD,

3527
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,000
WAS DRESSED IN BLACK BDUs AND

3528
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
A MILITARY-STYLE VEST.

3529
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,000
IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE THE

3530
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
KIND OF PREPLANNED THING THAT

3531
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,000
YOU SAW IN THE AURORA MOVIE

3532
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
SHOOTING MASSACRE.

3533
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
THIS DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE

3534
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,000
ALL THE HALLMARKS OF A DOMESTIC

3535
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:40,000
DISPUTE THAT CAUSED SOMEBODY TO

3536
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
SUDDENLY SNAP AND WALK INTO

3537
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
SCHOOL, THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS

3538
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
PLANNED.
BUT, AGAIN CAN, YOU KNOW, ALL OF

3539
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
THAT IS FOR ANOTHER DAY.

3540
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:52,000
RIGHT NOW THERE IS THE GRIEVING

3541
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,000
TO HANDLE.

3542
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
EIGHTEEN STUDENTS, WE'RE TOLD,

3543
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
ARE DEAD AT THIS CONNECTICUT

3544
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

3545
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
EIGHT ADULTS AS WELL AT THE

3546
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,000
HANDS OF A GUNMAN WHO TOOK AT

3547
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
LEAST TWO WEAPONS, A GLOCK AND A

3548
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
CIG SAUER, INTO AN ELEMENTARY

3549
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
SCHOOL, POSSIBLY EVEN A

3550
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM AND

3551
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
OPENED FIRE.
IT'S JUST BEYOND COMPREHENSION

3552
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
HOW SOMEBODY COULD WANT TO DO

3553
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, BUT THAT'S

3554
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
WHAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH IN

3555
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
CONNECTICUT RIGHT NOW.

3556
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
JENNA: THE BIG QUESTION FOR ALL

3557
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
THESE STORIES IS WHY, YOU KNOW,

3558
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
WHAT IS THE MOTIVE, WHY WOULD

3559
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
ANYONE DO THIS EVER?

3560
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
WE KNOW THAT'S A QUESTION WE

3561
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
STRUGGLE WITH AND YOU STRUGGLE

3562
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,000
WITH AT HOME, AND BRIGHTLY SO.

3563
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
HARRIS -- RIGHTFULLY SO.

3564
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,000
WE SAY BDUs, THAT'S BATTLE

3565
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
DRESS UNIFORMS.
THIS GUY HOWEVER OLD HE WAS WAS

3566
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
DRESS INSIDE WHAT SEEMS TO BE

3567
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
DESCRIBED IN MILITARY GEAR, AND

3568
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,000
THAT DOESN'T SUGGEST IT'S

3569
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
OFFICIAL MILITARY GEAR.

3570
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,000
YOU CAN BUY THIS STUFF ONLINE,

3571
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
AND, YOU KNOW --

3572
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,000
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY.
YOUR CONNECTION TO THE MILITARY

3573
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
AND MINE AS A DEPENDENT, I

3574
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
IMMEDIATELY WANTED TO KNOW MORE

3575
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,000
ABOUT WHAT THIS GUY MIGHT HAVE

3576
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
LOOKED LIKE.

3577
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
NOW, REMEMBER THE REPRESENTATIVE

3578
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
THERE, FRAY, HAD TWEETED OUT GUY

3579
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
SEEN MASKED GUNMAN.

3580
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
MASK WE'RE NOT POSITIVE ABOUT,

3581
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
BUT DRESSED IN BLACK BDU

3582
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
UNIFORMS, THOSE ARE VITAL TO

3583
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,000
EVERY MISSION.

3584
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
THAT'S HOW THEY'RE TERMED IN THE

3585
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
MILITARY.
THEY'RE CUTTING-EDGE MILITARY

3586
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
GEAR.
THAT WOULD MEAN THIS GUY WALKS

3587
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
ON THE SCENE, HE'S GOING TO BE A

3588
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
TOUGH TARGET EVEN IF YOU DO HAVE

3589
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,000
AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE HIM OUT

3590
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
THE WAY HE'S DRESSED AND QUITE

3591
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
FRIGHTENING.
CAN YOU IMAGINE THIS FOR THE

3592
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
CHILDREN?
WE WANT TO BRING EVERYBODY

3593
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
FORWARD NOW WITH THE STORY.

3594
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
THE TIMETABLE FOR THE NEWS

3595
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
CONFERENCE IS SHIFT AGO LITTLE

3596
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
BIT.
WE WERE HOPING IT WAS ABOUT

3597
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
THREE AND A HALF MINUTES, THEY

3598
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
MAY TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME.

3599
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
WE'LL POP UP WITH IT AS SOON AS

3600
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
IT HAPPENS, OF COURSE, HERE ON

3601
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
FOX NEWS CHANNEL.

3602
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
BUT I CAN TELL YOU FROM VERY

3603
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
EARLY ON LIEUTENANT PAUL VANCE

3604
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
WITH THE NEWTOWN POLICE

3605
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
DEPARTMENT THERE AND HIS

3606
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM WERE

3607
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
WORKING FIRST TO GET THE TRIAGE

3608
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
TOGETHER, THEY PULLED THAT BACK

3609
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
WHEN THEY REALIZED IT WASN'T

3610
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,000
NECESSARY AND PEELED THOSE TARPS

3611
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
OFF THE GROUND ABOUT 45 MINUTES

3612
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,000
AGO.
AND THEN THEY WERE SETTING UP

3613
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
THE COMMAND CENTER ABOUT TWO

3614
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
MILES FROM THIS LOCATION.

3615
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
WE KNOW THAT THAT HAS BEEN THE

3616
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
CENTRAL POINT.

3617
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
THEY'VE NOTIFIED THE PRESIDENT

3618
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
FROM THERE LETTING HIM KNOW, AND

3619
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I WOULD GUESS MANY MORE DETAILS

3620
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
THAN WE WERE GIVEN VERY EARLY ON

3621
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
AND EVEN NOW.

3622
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
SO AS WE WAIT FOR THAT NEWS

3623
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
CONFERENCE AND WE GET THOSE

3624
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,000
HEARTBREAKING NUMBERS THAT NOW

3625
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:20,000
ARE BEING CONFIRMED; 26 DEAD --

3626
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
NOT INCLUDING THE GUNMAN -- 18

3627
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
OF THEM CHILDREN.

3628
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
NO DOUBT WE'LL LEARN MORE

3629
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,000
POSSIBLY AS EARLY AS THE TOP OF

3630
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
THE HOUR, BUT POTENTIALLY A

3631
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
LITTLE BIT AFTER THAT.

3632
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
JON AND JENNA?

3633
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,000
JON: WE ARE AWAITING THIS NEWS

3634
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,000
CONFERENCE FROM AUTHORITIES.

3635
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
IT APPEARS THAT THEY ARE GETTING

3636
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
READY TO BEGIN, HARRIS.

3637
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:40,000
THEY ARE GIVING SOME MICROPHONE

3638
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,000
CHECKS AND SO FORTHRIGHT NOW.

3639
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
YOU CAN SEE IN THIS VIDEOTAPE

3640
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
FROM EARLIER, UM, JUST THE CHAOS

3641
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
THAT ERUPTED OUTSIDE THIS

3642
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

3643
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:53,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, A VERY,

3644
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,000
VERY PEACEFUL PLACE ABOUT 60

3645
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,000
MILES TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF

3646
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
NEW YORK CITY.

3647
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,000
NOT THE KIND OF THING WHERE YOU

3648
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
EXPECT THIS TO HAPPEN ON A

3649
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
BEAUTIFUL FRIDAY MORNING JUST

3650
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,000
BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND IN THE

3651
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
MIDDLE OF HANUKKAH.

3652
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:08,000
