1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
OUR WINTER WIPEOUT ZONE.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
THE EPIC COMPETITION
BEGINS NOW.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
ONE WILL BECOME A CHAMPION,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
BUT ALL WILL...

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
WIPEOUT.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
(woman) THIS TOTALLY LOOKS
DIFFERENT THAN THE VIDEO GAME!

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
HELLO, AMERICA, AND WELCOME
TO WINTER "WIPEOUT."

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'M JOHN ANDERSON,
HERE AS ALWAYS WITH JOHN HENSON.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
AND, UH... IS YOUR CHILD
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
NOT UNLESS HE LEARNED
HOW TO DRIVE.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I WAS REFERRING TO
THE BABY BACKPACK.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
(scoffs) OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S A BABY FRONTPACK.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
SECOND OF ALL,
IT'S AWESOME.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
AND THIRD OF ALL, IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE HOLDING SMALLSY.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
THIS IS DAY TWO OF OUR
BIG BROTHERS AND SMALL BALLSYs

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
WEEK OF FUN.
MM-HMM.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
BUT WHEN I WOKE UP
THIS MORNING,

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
THERE WAS NOTHING IN HERE
BUT A BUNCH OF CANDY WRAPPERS

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
AND AN EMPTY BOTTLE
OF COOKING SHERRY.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
THAT IS UNFORTUNATE.
I HOPE YOU LOCATE HIM SOON.

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
UH, RIGHT NOW, HOWEVER,
WE HAVE 24 PEOPLE OF LEGAL AGE

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
READY TO TAKE ON
OUR SNOW-COVERED COURSE

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
FOR THEIR CHANCE AT $50,000.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
FIRST UP, THE CHALLENGE OF
OUR WONDERFUL WINTERY QUALIFIER,

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
AND IT STARTS TODAY
WITH THE SKI LAUNCH.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
CAREFUL.
YOU MIGHT LOSE YOUR LAUNCH.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
THEN BURIED UNDER THE SNOW
IS A SKI BOOT.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
LIKE ALL SKI BOOTS,
IT'LL MAKE YOU WALK FUNNY.

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
FROM THERE,
IT'S UP TO THE BIG BALLS.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
CAPTURE THE PENGUIN
OFF THE FOURTH BALL--

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
THAT'S A $500 BONUS.
(chirps)

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
NEXT, CONTESTANTS CONFRONT
A GENTLE SNOWFALL.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
IT'S NO SNOW ANGEL.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
AND FINALLY, IT'S A FREEZING
TRIPCTIC CIRCLE,

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
WITH AN AUTHENTIC
ESKIMO VILLAGE.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
(snoring softly)
HEY, THAT'S NO ESKIMO!
THAT'S SMALLSY!

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
OH, DON'T WAKE HIM, JOHN.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
HE'LL JUST START CHEWING
ON MY SHOES AGAIN.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I WILL DO MY BEST.

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES
FOR THE 24 MEN AND WOMEN

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
WHO ARE ABOUT TO TAKE A SHOT
AT OUR COURSE.
ALL RIGHT,

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
LET'S GO TO VANESSA LACHEY
AND SEE WHO'S FIRST.

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
RIGHT NOW ON DECK,
WE HAVE KATIE HELMUTH.

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
KATIE GAGA IS GONNA SHOW
THOSE RED BALLS HER POKER FACE!

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
KATIE GAGA NOT AFRAID,
JOHN.

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I HOPE. (chuckles)
SHE WAS BORN THAT WAY.

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
(air horn blows)
AH, IT'S PERFECT. KATIE HELMUTH
IS A LADY GAGA IMPERSONATOR.

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
OH, WELL,
CAN SHE DO LINDSEY VONN?

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
AAH!
AH!

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
(laughs) NO! GOODNESS, NO.
OH, HO HO!

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
AAH!
OHH!

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
POKER FACE IS ALL-IN.
AAH!

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I THINK I SPOTTED HER TELL.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
AAH! OH!

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
KATIE GAGA NOW ON TO
THE SKI BOOT,

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
WHERE HER 15-INCH PLATFORMS
ARE NO MATCH

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
FOR OUR 8-FOOT PLATFORM...

58
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
AND THE SKI BOOT.
AAH! AAH! NO!

59
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
HA HA HA!
OHH, HO HO!

60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
JOHN, I THINK THAT WRINKLED

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
HER OUTFIT MADE OF CHIPPED HAM
AND LIVE BEES.

62
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
(buzzing)
AAH!

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
NO!

64
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
KATIE GAGA GETTING AN EYEFUL
OF OUR MONSTER BALLS,

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
WHERE SHE CAN PUT HER MEAT SUIT
UP AGAINST A PENGUIN SUIT

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
FOR A CHANCE TO WIN
500 BUCKS.
(chirps)

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
BIG BALLS!

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
IS HER POKER FACE HIDING
FOUR OF A KIND?

69
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
AAH!
(squawks)

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
AW, YEAH!
OH, HO HO!

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
YEAH!
HEY, 500 BUCKS
FOR KATIE GAGA.

72
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I HAVEN'T SEEN
A PENGUIN MASSACRE THAT BAD

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
SINCE DANNY DeVITO
IN "BATMAN."

74
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
AAH!
(squawks)

75
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
WOW. I THOUGHT SHE WAS SUPPOSED
TO LIKE ANIMALS.

76
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
OH, MAN!

77
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
KATIE GAGA SITTING ATOP
THE SNOWFALL,

78
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
READY TO RECORD
ANOTHER SMASH HIT.
AAH!

79
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
RAH, RAH, ROMA--OW!

80
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
MM!

81
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
WOW! THAT'LL LEAVE
A COMPACT DISC.

82
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
AAH!
IT'S CERTAINLY
AN ORIGINAL MOVE.

83
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
YOU'RE RIGHT. SHE DIDN'T
STEAL THAT FROM MADONNA.

84
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
(crunch)
(slo-mo voice) AAH!

85
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
THAT ONE HURT!

86
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
WELL, KATIE GAGA CAN
PUT A LITTLE ICE ON IT

87
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
HERE AT THE ARCTIC CIRCLE,
HOME OF THE ESKIMO VILLAGE.
(groans)

88
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
AND GARY.
HELLO!

89
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
HE'S YOUR NUMBER ONE FAN.

90
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
THIS IS SO EXCITING!
(chuckles nervously)

91
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
OH, BOY. OH. HEH.
OH, UH, THAT FEELS FUNNY.

92
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
UH-OH. (chuckling nervously)

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
COME ON, CALM DOWN. WOW. HE DOES
NOT GET OUT OF THE IGLOO MUCH.

94
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
OH, BOY.

95
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
OOH, BOY!
OOH, HO HO!

96
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
CHILI!

97
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
YEAH, KATIE GAGA, GARY'S KNOWN
FOR HIS ESKIMO CHILI...

98
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
(chuckles)
MADE WITH REAL ESKIMO.

99
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
KATIE GAGA INCHING TOWARDS
THE HOWIE MANDEL OF POLAR BEARS.

100
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
THAT POLAR BEAR
WAS ON "ST. ELSEWHERE"?
(grumbles)

101
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
NO. SEE, HE'S A GERMOPHOBE.
HEY, POLAR BEAR.

102
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
SHE'LL BE FINE AS LONG
AS SHE DOESN'T TOUCH IT.

103
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
OH, NOT--NOT GOOD.
UH-OH.

104
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
(polar bear growling,
Smallsy snoring)

105
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
OH, HO!
OHH!

106
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
AH, THAT LITTLE SCAMP
CAN SLEEP THROUGH ANYHOW.

107
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
AAH! AAH!
KATIE GAGA SLIDES OVER,

108
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
BUT I WOULD ADVISE AVOIDING
THE BEAR'S FOOD SUPPLIES.

109
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
UHH! AH!

110
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
OHH!
AH! GO FISH.

111
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
(growls) HEY.

112
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
KATIE GAGA--SHE'S THE REAL DEAL,
HOWEVER,

113
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
SETTING A GREAT OPENING TIME--
3 MINUTES AND 10 SECONDS.

114
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'M GONNA DIE. OHH!

115
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
HEADED UP TO THE SKI LAUNCH NOW
IS CHRIS WHITHORN.
WHOO!

116
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
MAYBE HE'LL HAVE
BETTER LUCK--

117
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
YOU KNOW,
SINCE YOU HOT WAXED THE SKIS.
I DIDN'T WAX THEM, JOHN.

118
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
THEY WERE ALREADY HAIRLESS.
YEAH, NOT WHAT I MEANT.

119
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
AAH!
OH, BOY.

120
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
OHH, HO! WOW.
MM!

121
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I REALLY THOUGHT HE HAD IT
WHEN HE FLAPPED HIS ARMS, JOHN.

122
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
WORKS SO WELL IN CARTOONS.

123
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
YEAH,
THAT WENT DOWNHILL FAST.

124
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
VANESSA, WHAT'S THIS GUY'S
SKILL SET?

125
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
ANYTHING FUNKY?
LIKE, ARE YOU DOUBLE-JOINTED?

126
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
CAN YOU SING? CAN YOU DANCE?
DO YOU HAVE CRAZY VOICES?

127
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
UM, I DO HAVE CRAZY VOICES.

128
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I HAVE A PERSON LIVING
IN MY HEAD NAMED LEONARD.

129
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
(cuckoo clock chimes)

130
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
ALL RIGHT.

131
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
SO... WHAT DOES LEONARD THINK
ABOUT THE SHOW?

132
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
(goofy voice)
LEONARD LOVES THIS SHOW.

133
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
UM, HE THINKS IT'S GONNA BE
A FUN TIME TODAY.

134
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
WHAT KIND OF SKILLS
DO YOU HAVE?

135
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
(normal voice)
SKILLS IN WHAT WAY?
LEONARD, NOT CHRIS.

136
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
(goofy voice) I'M THE BRAINS
OF THIS SITUATION.

137
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I MEAN, SO...
OF COURSE.

138
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
(John H.) ALL RIGHT, LEONARD,
BACK IN THE HEAD.

139
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
(John A.) WOW, 2-FOR-1!
I LOVE IT.

140
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
A COUPLED ENTRY
HEADED TO THE BIG BALLS.

141
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I WONDER WHO WE'RE GONNA SEE.
(normal voice) WHOO!
THAT PENGUIN'S GOING DOWN!

142
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
PHEW! IT'S CHRIS.

143
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
(goofy voice)
THAT PENGUIN'S GOING DOWN!

144
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
OH, NO. IT'S LEONARD.

145
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
AAH!

146
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
OHH!
OHH, HO!

147
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
OH, YOU'D THINK
ONE OF HIS VOICES

148
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
WOULD TELL HIM
TO KEEP HIS LEGS CLOSED.

149
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
OH, MY GOD!

150
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
UP AHEAD,
EXPLORING THE ARCTIC CIRCLE

151
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
IS ALISHA KHATWANI.
AAH!

152
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
OH, HO!
AH! GARY JUST TOSSED HER
INTO THE CHILI.

153
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I HATE CHILI, AND I'M INDIAN.

154
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
OH. (laughs)
I CAN'T TAKE SPICES.

155
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
OOH! WELL,
THAT OUGHTA COOL YOU OFF.

156
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
WOW, THESE ESKIMOS ARE DEADLY
WITH A SNOWBALL.

157
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
HEY, WAIT, THAT'S VANESSA.
NO!

158
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
PRETTY GOOD HOSE
ON THAT GAL.

159
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
YEAH, TOO BAD
FOR THE CONTESTANTS,

160
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
BUT GREAT FOR
THE COMPANY SOFTBALL TEAM.

161
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
EAT IT,
LADIES OF "THE VIEW"!

162
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
YA!
OH, HO!

163
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
(laughs)
THAT CHILI'S NASTY.

164
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
HEY, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO DOUBLE-DIPPED.

165
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000

(laughs)

173
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
WHOO-HOO! PARTY TIME, BABY!
WHOO!

174
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
WHY AM I PARTYING, JOHN?
WHAT'S UP, BABY?

175
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
BECAUSE THIS IS WEDDING SINGER
RICKY LaCORTE.

176
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
HEY, I LOVE WEDDING SINGERS!

177
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
THE COVER SONGS,
THE SKINNY TIES...

178
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
EVERYBODY, MAKE SOME NOISE!

179
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
THE WAY THEY GET YOU SO EXCITED
THAT YOU DON'T EVEN CARE

180
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THAT THE BRIDE WAS
YOUR GIRLFRIEND FOR FIVE YEARS

181
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
BEFORE SHE STARTED CHEATING
ON YOU WITH THE GROOM.

182
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
(John A.) TOO PERSONAL?
YOU OKAY?

183
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
BETTER THAN THIS GUY.

184
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
OH, HO!
AH!

185
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
HE THREW HIS LEGS IN THE AIR
LIKE HE JUST DIDN'T CARE, JOHN.

186
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
(stretch, smack)
OOH!

187
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
NOW HE'LL BE ABLE TO SING
ALL THE LADY PARTS.

188
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
OH! NOW GETTING A PAT
ON THE BACK AT THE SKI BOOT

189
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
IS 27 YEAR OLD ERIN BENNETT.

190
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
AAH!

191
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
OHH!
OHH! AND ANOTHER SHOT
TO THE BACK.

192
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
SHE'S GONNA HAVE
SOME SERIOUS SWELLING.

193
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
(stretch)
AAH! UGH!

194
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
AAH! HOLY COW!
GET HER AN ICE PACK, STAT!

195
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
OOH!
ACTUALLY,
SHE MEANT TO DO THAT.

196
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
SHE LIKES TO POP OUT
HER SHOULDER BLADES,

197
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
MAKE HERSELF LOOK LIKE
A PTERODACTYL.

198
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
(Vanessa) CAN YOU MAKE
THE PTERODACTYL SOUNDS?

199
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
(screeches)
(laughs)

200
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
(John H.) YEAH, I KINDA WISH
I COULD UNSEE THAT.

201
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
BUT THOSE PTERODACTYL WINGS
COULD HELP HER ON THE BIG BALLS.

202
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'M NOT SURE
THIS IS ENTIRELY FAIR, JOHN,

203
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
BUT SHE'S GOT A GIFT.

204
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
OH! (screeches)
(clank)

205
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
OHH!
OH, HO!

206
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
OH, LIKE ICARUS, SHE DARED SAIL
TOO HIGH, JOHN...

207
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
OH! (screeches)

208
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
AND TRIPPED ON HER
TINY LITTLE PTERODACTYL FEET.

209
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
(groaning)
IS SHE MAKING
PTERODACTYL SNOW ANGELS NOW?

210
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
NO, JOHN,
THE ICE IS MELTING.
(screeches)

211
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

212
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
SPRING?
YOU WISH!

213
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
IT'S MAN VERSUS ANIMAL.

214
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
GLOBAL WARMING UPSETS
THE DELICATE BALANCE OF NATURE.

215
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
OHH!
OH, HO!

216
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
WELL, HE DOES SEEM HOSTILE.

217
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
JUST FROM BEING TOUCHED.

218
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
AH!
OH, HO HO!

219
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
OOH!
OHH!

220
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
CLEARLY HE'S NERVOUS.

221
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
YOU MELT THE POLAR ICE CAPS,

222
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
AND YOU RELEASE
PREHISTORIC BEASTS.

223
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
(roars)
AAH!

224
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
YABBA DABBA...

225
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
AAH!
D'OH!

226
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
SERIOUSLY?
THAWED-OUT DINOSAURS?

227
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
OH, HO HO!
AH!

228
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
IT'S SCIENCE, JOHN.

229
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
THEY CAN'T PUT IT ON
THE INTERNET IF IT ISN'T TRUE.

230
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
HOW ELSE DO YOU EXPLAIN
MOTIVATOR-SAURUS REX?

231
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
(metallic chomping)
BET SHE'LL RECYCLE NOW.

232
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
(roars)
AAH!

233
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
UH-OH, SHE'S EXTINCT.

234
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
MM, HMM HMM HMM!
OH, HO HO HO! MAN!

235
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
AND WHAT ABOUT
E

236
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
FROZEN IN
THE ALASKAN SEWER SYSTEM?
(screeches)

237
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
OH, MY GOD.

238
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
AAH! OH, THAT'S SCARY!
(snarls)

239
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
JOHN, WHERE DID YOU STUDY
SCIENCE?
AAH!

240
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
ED'S BAIT AND TACKLE
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WHY?

241
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
SEE YOU LATER, ALLIGATOR!

242
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
AAH!
(crunch)

243
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THERE'S BRANDI BERG.
WATCH OUT!

244
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
OH, WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?
AAH!

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000

ARE YOU DONE NOW, JOHN?

248
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
JUST A SEC.
AAH! UHH!

249
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
YEP, THAT'LL DO IT.
(burps)

250
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
NOW COMING UP TO THE SKI BOOT
IS AIMEE REILLY.

251
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
WHOO! I'M CRAZY!

252
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
WELL,
MOST OF OUR CONTESTANTS ARE.

253
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
AH!
OHH!

254
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
MM!
OHH, HO!

255
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
WELL, JOHN, AIMEE SAID SHE'S
KNOWN FOR BEING WILD AND CRAZY,

256
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
AND VANESSA TOOK A TRIP WITH HER
TO HER CRAZYTOWN.
(train whistle blows)

257
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
WHAT'S, LIKE, THE CRAZIEST THING
THAT YOU'VE DONE?

258
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
OH. UH, I HAVE A...
GOOD ONE.

259
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
(John H.) GO ON.
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED

260
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
EATING A PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICH
WITH NO MILK?

261
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
HAVE YOU EVER DONE THAT?

262
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I DON'T--I'M CONFUSED. ARE THERE
LIVE ROACHES ON THE SANDWICH?

263
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
YOU REALLY NEED THE MILK
TO WASH IT DOWN.

264
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
OR THE JELLY.
THAT, TOO.

265
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
(John H.) WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
THIS STORY ENDS

266
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
IN A FISTFIGHT WITH TWO NUNS,
A HIGH-SPEED CHASE,

267
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
AND A FELONY ARREST?
(John A.) I DON'T KNOW. 2%?

268
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
BUT COMING ON "WIPEOUT" IS
ACTUALLY PRETTY WILD AND CRAZY.

269
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
WELL, THAT WILD AND CRAZY GAL
IS NOW ON A 40-FEET SLIDE

270
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
WITH A PEANUT BUTTER
SANDWICH...
AAH!

271
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
AND NO MILK!

272
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
AY!
OH, HO HO HO!

273
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
OHH! SORRY, AIMEE.

274
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
OH, THE CRAZY'S GETTING
PRETTY THICK OUT HERE.

275
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I THINK NOW'S A GOOD TIME
FOR A BREAK.

276
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
THAT KINDA HURT.

277
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
WHATCHA GOT?
OH, PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICH, HUH?

278
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
YEAH, WITH NO MILK.
WHAT'S SO CRAZY ABOUT THAT?

279
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
WAIT FOR IT.

280
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
HERE IT COMES.

281
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
WHAT'S THE FOURTH LARGEST CITY
IN MINNESOTA?

282
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
(mouth full) DULUTH.

283
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
DULUTH. DULUTH!

284
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
NO! ANDERSON,
I CAN'T OPEN MY MOUTH!

285
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'M SORRY.
CAN'T OPEN YOUR MOUTH?

286
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
NO!

287
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
YES. SO I WILL ENJOY
THE SWEET SOUNDS OF SILENCE

288
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
WHILE YOU ENJOY
THESE COMMERCIALS.

289
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
UHH!

290
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
AAH! OH!

291
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
WHOO! AAH!

292
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
MAYBE SOMEBODY COULD
GET HIM SOME MILK, HUH?

293
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
PLEASE?
(chuckles)

294
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Before the tissue, help
defend with a wipe.

295
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Before the cold & flu
season,

296
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
help prevent with Lysol.

297
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Because when you have 10
times more protection

298
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
with each hand wash...

299
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and kill 99.9% of germs around
the house with each spray...

300
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Those healthy habits
start to add up.

301
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This season, a good
offense is the best defense

302
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
BUT HERE'S A QUICK RECAP.

335
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
UH... UH, PEOPLE FELL DOWN.

336
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
THAT IS
AN EXCELLENT SUMMATION.

337
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
YEAH, THANKS.
FELT PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT.

338
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
GLAD YOU ARE HAPPY, AND I HOPE
WE CAN SAY THE SAME NOW

339
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
FOR OUR NEXT CONTESTANT.

340
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
JOE VAUX IS AT
THE TOP OF THE COURSE.

341
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
(ominous music playing)
ARMS LIKE THE EAGLE!

342
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
CLAWS LIKE THE MONKEY!

343
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
THE IMAGERY OF DARKNESS
IS AT MY FINGERTIPS!

344
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
(thunderclap,
electricity hums)
WOW, HE IS INTENSE!

345
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I WILL PAINT THEE!
(music warps)

346
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
WHOO!
DID HE SAY "PAINT"?

347
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
YEAH, JOHN. JOE'S AN ARTIST.
THAT'S UN-TENSE.

348
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
WELL, HE CHANNELS THE INTENSITY
INTO HIS WORK.
(thriller music playing)

349
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
WHOA! I CAN'T PUT MY FINGER
ON IT,

350
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
I REALLY LIKE.

351
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
(Vanessa) THIS IS
HENSON EATING ANDERSON?

352
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I ACCENTED HIS TAIL,
WHICH YOU DON'T SEE ON TV MUCH,

353
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
BUT I KNOW HE'S GOT ONE.
YEAH.

354
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
AND THEN POOR ANDERSON--

355
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
ARE YOU NOT A SPORTS FAN?
OR WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

356
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
YOU KNOW, PART OF THAT WAS

357
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I JUST RAN OUT OF ROOM
ON THE PAPER.

358
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
BUT RIGHT NOW, UH, YOU KNOW,
HENSON'S, UH, THE BIG FISH.

359
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
(air horn blows)
(John H.) AND I GOT THE GILLS
TO PROVE IT, JOHNNY.

360
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
JOHN, DO YOU THINK JOE'S ART
WILL BE WORTH MORE POSTHUMOUSLY?

361
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
(John A.) WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU IMPLYING?
AAH!

362
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
OHH!
OH, HO HO!
VAN GOGHING, GOING, GONE!

363
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
AAH!
HE BURIED HIS HEAD
IN HIS SKI, JOHN.

364
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
THAT'S A COMMITMENT
TO DARKNESS.

365
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
DARK ARTIST JOE--
A BRUSH WITH THE SKI BOOT.

366
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
OH, HO! YEAH!
AND HE MADE AN IMPRESSION.
OHH!

367
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
WELL DONE!
(whooshing)

368
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
WOW! SHOWING A LITTLE
PERFORMANCE ART.

369
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
HE IS ON A ROLL, MAN.
IF HE GRABS THAT PENGUIN,

370
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
HE MIGHT WIN 500 BUCKS WORTH
OF DARK ART SUPPLIES.
HERE WE GO!

371
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
OH! EE, YAH!
OHH! OH, HO HO HO!

372
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
OH, I LOVE IT WHEN LIFE IMITATES
DARK ART.

373
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
(crunch)

374
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
HEY, IF YOU DON'T WANNA
GET EATEN,

375
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
DON'T SWIM IN A POND

376
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
WITH A BIG FISH AND BIG BALLS
AND BIG SNOWFLAKES.

377
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
UHH!
AH!

378
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
OH, HO HO!

379
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
HEY! LOOK AT THE CUTE,
LITTLE FLUFFY BUNNY TAIL.

380
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'M BEGINNING TO QUESTION
HIS COMMITMENT TO DARK ARTS.

381
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
WELL, I THINK THE DARK ARTIST
IS GONNA LOVE ARCTIC CIRCLE.

382
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IT'S DARK UP THERE, LIKE,

383
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
24 HOURS A DAY
DURING WINTER.

384
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
YAH!
OH, HO! AND EVEN DARKER WHEN
YOU'RE HEAD IS DUNKED IN CHILI.

385
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
THIS CHILI SMELLS AWFUL.

386
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
ARE YOU SURE?
IT COULD BE GARY.

387
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
HE'S GOT A LITTLE
PERSPIRATION PROBLEM.
(chuckles nervously)

388
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
(roars)
OHH! OH!

389
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
OH! ON THE CANVAS!
SLIDING...

390
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
HOLD IT!
WOW!

391
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
NICE RECOVERY! BUT I'D WATCH OUT
FOR AQUATIC POP ART.

392
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
OH!
OHH!

393
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
OOH! RIGHT IN HIS WARHOL!
(Vanessa) OH!

394
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
THAT IS NOT A PRETTY PICTURE.

395
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
OH, MY GOD!
THE DARK ARTIST
WITH A TERRIFIC TIME OF...

396
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
UHH! STUPID!
WELL, IT'S GONNA BE
UNDER 3 MINUTES.

397
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
MAMA MIA!

398
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
NOW SCALING THE SKI BOOT
IS SONIA ALCAZAR...

399
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
OKAY, HERE WE GO, RED BALLS!

400
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
WHO APPARENTLY THINKS
SHE'S AT THE BIG REALLY BALLS.

401
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
OVER THE RED BALLS!
OVER THE RED BALLS!

402
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
OVER THE RED BALLS!
JOHN, YOU THINK MAYBE
WE SHOULD TELL HER

403
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
SHE'S NOT AT THE BIG BALLS?
OVER THE RED BALLS!

404
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
NOW WHERE IS THE FUN
IN THAT?

405
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
OVER THE RED BALLS! AH!
WHOOPS!

406
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
AFTER ALL, THE VERY BEST GIFTS
ARE A SURPRISE.

407
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
AAH!

408
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
YA, HA HA!
OH, HO HO!
(singsongy) SURPRISE!

409
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
(air horn blows)
JOHN, PERHAPS 20 YEAR OLD
LINDSAY WEGLARZ

410
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
WILL HAVE BETTER LUCK
ON THE COURSE.

411
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
OH, MY GOD. I HATE SKIING.

412
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
COME ON, LINDSAY.
THERE'S NOTHING TO IT.

413
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
IT'S ALL ABOUT FORM.
YOU JUST LEAN FORWARD.

414
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
NO, BACK! NO, FORWARD!
MM. AH!

415
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
WAIT! BACK!
OH, NOPE, IT'S FORWARD.
OH, NO! OH, NO!

416
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
OH, HO HO!
YA!

417
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
NO, NO, NO, NO!
OH, HER BODY SAYS "AGONY,"

418
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
BUT HER FACE SAYS...
YEAH, "AGONY."

419
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
WASN'T ALWAYS.

420
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
VANESSA SPOKE WITH LINDSAY
PRECRASH-LANDING.

421
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
OHH! WHAT IN THE WORLD?!

422
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
LOOK HOW CUTE, WITH YOUR
SOFT HAIR AND YOUR LITTLE BOW!

423
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
(laughs)
YOU'RE SO CUTE.

424
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I STOLE THIS FROM
THE GIRL I NANNY FOR.

425
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
YOU STOLE THAT FROM THE KID
YOU NANNY FOR?

426
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
YEAH.
(gasps)

427
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
YOU WON'T NOTICE.
SHE HAS PLENTY OF STUFF.

428
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
(John H.) WOW!
WHEN SHE HOLDS UP A BABY,

429
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
SHE LITERALLY
HOLDS UP A BABY.

430
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
AAH! UHH!
AH, HA HA!

431
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
OH, HO HO!

432
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR STEALING A KID'S CLOTHES.

433
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
AND SHE STOLE
MY FAVORITE ROPE!

434
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
AAH!
(rips)

435
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'M SORRY FOR STEALING
THE HEADBAND.

436
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
UGH.
WHAT ABOUT ROPE?

437
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
(laughs)
WELL, IT'S TOO LATE NOW,
LINDSAY,

438
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
BECAUSE WITH THIS SKI BOOT...

439
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
OH!
OH, HO HO!
"SORRY" JUST ISN'T ENOUGH.

440
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
OKAY.

441
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
IS NO ONE SAFE
FROM THE AGONY OF DE FEET?

442
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
GET IT? "DE FEET"?

443
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
AH. GREAT. LOVE IT.
ESPECIALLY NOT THIS GUY.

444
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
HE'S CHEWING GUM
ON THE COURSE, JOHN.
(air horn blows)

445
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
YEAH, THAT'S BRIAN AYA,

446
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
WHO SAYS HE CHEWS GUM
EVERYWHERE HE GOES.

447
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
HE EVEN SHOWED VANESSA HOW
HE GETS 40 PIECES IN HIS MOUTH.

448
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
DON'T WORRY.
THAT'LL DIGEST IN 7-10 YEARS.

449
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
SO HERE'S A GUY WITH
40 PIECES OF GUM IN HIS MOUTH,

450
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
AND HE'S AT THE SKI BOOT.
ANYBODY KNOW THE HEIMLICH?

451
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
WHOO! AAH!

452
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
OHH!
OHH, HO HO! OH, HO HO!

453
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
BALLSY KNOWS THE HEIMLICH,
BUT HE'S HAD ZERO SAVES, JOHN.

454
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
(Brian groans)
VERY SHORT ARMS.

455
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
UH, NO ARMS. HANDS.

456
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
(gags)
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT, GUM GUY.

457
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
THAT'S MR. GUM TO YOU.

458
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
PENGUIN, I'M COMING.
HIKING UP TO THE BIG BALLS NOW

459
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
IS 34-YEAR-OLD BARBER
STEFAN ROBERTS.

460
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
GOING FOR THE PENGUIN CASH...

461
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
AH!
OHH!

462
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
THIS DUDE IS NOT GOING
ANYWHERE NEAR MY HAIR.

463
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
DID HE REALLY THINK HE COULD
REACH THE PENGUIN FROM THERE?

464
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
AAH!

465
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I PREFER A BARBER WITH A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF DEPTH PERCEPTION.

466
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
QUACK.
BUT THAT IS
A PRETTY SICK MULLET.

467
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
BACK AT THE SKI BOOT IS
FRESHLY RINSED JASON WISHNOV.

468
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
WHOO!
HE'S A VOICE ACTOR.

469
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
(high-pitched voice)
AAH! OH, MY!

470
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
OW!
D'OH!

471
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
WELL, HE'S GOT THE ROLE OF
SCREAMING LITTLE GIRL DOWN PAT.

472
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
(high-pitched voice)
AAH! OH, MY!

473
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
JUST A TIP, JOHN--

474
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
VANESSA DISCOVERED THE FULL
RANGE OF HIS VOICE TALENTS.

475
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
(normal voice)
THAT AIN'T NOTHING!

476
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
BETTER THAN THAT!

477
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'M A VOICE ACTOR. I DO IT
FOR ANIME AND VIDEO GAMES.

478
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I TEND TO PLAY THE DEEPER,
VILLAINOUS KINDA ROLES.

479
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
UH...

480
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
OKAY, SO GIVE ME
YOUR VILLAINOUS VOICE.

481
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
(deep voice) IS THIS WHAT
YOU WANT TO HEAR, VANESSA?

482
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
(John H.) HUH.
DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME EFFECT

483
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
WITHOUT A CARTOON SCAR
AND A GRUMPY HUMPBACK BUTLER.
(Vanessa) UM, WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

484
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
(normal voice) I HAVE
A SMOOTH, DEBONAIR KINDA GUY.

485
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
OF COURSE, THIS IS WHAT I WOULD
USE IF I WERE, YOU KNOW,

486
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
ASKING YOU OUT ON A DATE.

487
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
(John H.) HUH.
I WONDER WHAT KIND

488
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
OF A VOICE VANESSA
WOULD USE TO SAY NO.

489
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
(John A.) YEAH,
HOPEFULLY THE VOICE ACTOR

490
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
WILL BE SLIGHTLY SMOOTHER
ON THE BIG BALLS.

491
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
OH! HE LANDED THAT BETTER
THAN ANY VOICE ACTING WORK.

492
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
YEAH, PERHAPS HE CAN GET

493
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000

fanfare plays)
HEY, HE GOT IT!
WELL DONE.

495
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
YEAH, BUT HE'LL PROBABLY
HAVE TO STRETCH OUT THAT MONEY

496
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
FOR A WHILE. NOT A LOT OF VOICE
ACTING WORK OUT THERE.

497
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
QUACK.
I KNOW!

498
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

499
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000

504
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000

NO, SEE "DIVER DOWN"
IS WHAT SCUBA DIVERS SAY.

509
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
TIM HUNTS FOR SUNKEN TREASURE.

510
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
IS THAT RIGHT? YOU KNOW, I WENT
TREASURE HUNTING IN A LAKE ONCE.
(firing)

511
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
ALL I FOUND WAS ALGAE
AND A HUMAN SHIN.

512
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000

OHH, HO HO!

516
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
TWO CONTESTANTS ALREADY BEAT HIM
TO THE FIRST TINY TREASURE.

517
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
WHOO! AAH!
(clank)

518
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
IF TIM MAKES IT PAST
THE CANNONBALLS...

519
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
OHH!
OHH! HE'D BE THE THIRD
PENGUIN-HOPPER TODAY.

520
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
DIVER DOWN!

521
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
WHOA, HO HO!

522
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
OH, WELL, TECHNICALLY,

523
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
IT WAS DIVER DOWN, DIVER UP,
THEN DIVER DOWN.

524
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
WELL, THE TREASURE HUNTER'S

525
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000

528
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
HEADFIRST INTO THE WATER.

529
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
JOHN, DO I SEE A TREASURE
DOWN THERE?

530
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
NOPE. THAT'S THE DOOR TO
MY PRIVATE UNDERWATER BATHROOM.

531
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I MAKE SURE IT'S IN
EVERY CONTRACT I SIGN.

532
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
AAH!
OH, HO!

533
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
AND THE TREASURE HUNTER'S

535
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000

TO TAKE HOME

536
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
THE BULLION THAT'S IN THERE.
(roaring)

537
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
OOH, HOO! HE IS ROMANCING

YOU KNOW, JOHNNY, THIS NEXT
OBSTACLE HAS INSPIRED ME

568
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
TO TAKE UP A NEW WINTER HOBBY--
ICE FISHING.

569
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
OH, THAT SOUNDS FUN.
OH, IT IS! AND REWARDING.

570
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
TURNS OUT I'M AN EXCELLENT
ICE FISHERMAN.

571
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
MY FREEZER
IS COMPLETELY FULL.

572
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
LOT OF FISH, HUH? WHAT KIND?

573
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
FISH? (chuckles)
NO, JOHN, ICE.

574
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
ICE FISHING.
CATCHING FISH WOULD BE HARD.
YEAH. MM-HMM.

575
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
BOY, YOU'RE NOT REAL OUTDOORSY,
ARE YA?

576
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
WELL, CLEAR--CLEARLY NOT
YOUR CALIBER.

577
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
UH, WHY DON'T WE GO FISHING
FOR SOME WIPEOUTS

578
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
ON OUR NEXT OBSTACLE,
PAIN IN THE ICE?

579
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
TELL 'EM HOW IT WORKS, JOHNNY.
I GOT NO IDEA.

580
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

581
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
CONTESTANTS BEGIN
HIGH IN THE AIR,

582
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
PERCHED AROUND OUR ICE HOLE.
IT'S HARD TO RELAX UP THERE.

583
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
THEY WILL BRAVE
THE ARCTIC WATERS,

584
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
DROPPING THROUGH THE HOLE,
ONTO THE FISHING POLE

585
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
FOR A SPIN OVER TO
THE LANDING PLATFORM.

586
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
THEN IT'S A TRICKY BALANCING ACT
ATOP THE LUMBER TUMBLER,

587
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
AN ICE-SLICKED WALK ACROSS THIS
WOODEN PLANK TO THE OTHER SIDE.

588
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
THAT'S FOLLOWED BY

589
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
A PERILOUS TRIP ACROSS
THE FROSTY FOOTBRIDGE,

590
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
FEATURING A RELENTLESS FREEZING
RUSH FROM OUR ARCTIC WATERFALL.

591
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
FINALLY, THEY WILL MOVE IT
OR LUGE IT

592
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
WITH A BELLY SLIDE
DOWN THE SNOW CHUTE.

593

595
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000

WELL, SURE. YOU'RE IN
THE PRESENCE OF GREATNESS.

602
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000

621
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
HANGING ON AND DROPS
AT THE PLATFORM.

622
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
WHOO!

WHO'S HE TALKING TO,

654
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000

OH, HELL, NO.

656
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000

WITH LEONARD.

657
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
TREASURE HUNTER TIM
HOT ON THEIR TRAIL.

658
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
WHOO-HOO!
HE REMINDS ME OF

659
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
THE GREAT TREASURE HUNTER
NICOLAS CAGE.

660
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
BLIND BARBER FINALLY
FIGURING OUT THE POLE.

661
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
AW, YEAH!
HE ENVISIONED SUCCESS, PEOPLE.
OH, HO HO!

662
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
YOU GO FIRST, MAN.

663
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
THOSE GUYS GIVING
TREASURE HUNTER PERMISSION

664
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
TO BE THE FIRST EXPLORER.

665
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
(Aimee) ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
WATCH OUT.

666
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
DO NOT STAND IN THE WAY
OF WILD AND CRAZY.

667
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
SHE SHOVES TREASURE HUNTER
FORWARD.

668
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
SAFE!
OH, HO HO!

669
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
WILD AND CRAZY--
OH! FALLING AND SPLASHING.
OHH!

670
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
WHOO!

671
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
TREASURE HUNTER
BEATING HIS CHEST,

672
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
BUT STILL HAS TO MAKE IT DOWN
THE SNOW CHUTE.

673
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
AH, HA HA!
OHH!
NOW HE'S SUNKEN TREASURE HUNTER

674
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
DARK ARTIST
ON THE FOOTBRIDGE.

675
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
BY THE POWER OF GRAYSKULL,
HE'S GOT IT!

676
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
COMING UP FROM BEHIND--MR. GUM
AND VOICE ACTOR JASON.

677
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
HE IS HANGING ON
FOR ALL HE'S WORTH.

678
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
AND WILD AND CRAZY
MAKES IT A THREESOME.

679
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
OH, HO HO! PARTY'S OVER, KIDS.
OHH, HO HO!

680
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
THE BLIND BARBER WAY BEHIND,

681
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
TRYING TO FEEL, SMELL, OR TASTE
HIS WAY PAST THE LUMBER TUMBLER.

682
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
UHH! AAH!

683
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I HOPE HE WASN'T HOLDING
SCISSORS.

684
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
DARK ARTIST DIVES
ONTO THE SNOW CHUTE.

685
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
OHH!
OHH!

686
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
HE TOOK THE CAMERA WITH HIM,
AND YOU JUST KNOW

687
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
HE'S GONNA USE IT IN A WAY
THE F.C.C. WOULDN'T APPROVE.

688
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
(Jason) I AIN'T GETTING
LEFT BEHIND!

689
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
VOICE ACTOR JASON SLIDES TOWARDS
THE CASTING COUCH.

690
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
OHH!
AH! HIS WORDS WEREN'T ENOUGH.

691
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
(squawks)

692
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
SOUNDS LIKE TREASURE HUNTER TIM
SWALLOWED HIS PARROT.

693
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
JACKPOT!

694
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
YEAH!

695
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
TIM GOT IT!

696
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
TREASURE HUNTER TIM
THE FIRST TO MOVE ON...

697
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
NEXT IN LINE TO JOIN HIM

698
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
ARE KATIE GAGA
AND LEONARD'S FRIEND CHRIS.

699
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
YEAH, IT'S GETTING CROWDED
OUT THERE, JOHN--

700
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
JUST LIKE IN CHRIS' HEAD.

701
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
KATIE GAGA IS ON,

702
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
AND LEONARD'S FRIEND TALKS
HIMSELF INTO IT WAS WELL.

703
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
AHEAD OF THEM, VOICE ACTOR JASON
WITH A CHANCE TO STEAL THE SHOW.

704
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
OHH, NO!
OH, HO HO!

705
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
OH, HE'LL NEVER GET AN AGENT
THAT WAY.

706
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
THE DARK ARTIST SLIDING
TO DAYLIGHT.

707
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
BRAKES! WHOA!
OHH!

708
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
YEAH! WHOO!
USES THE DARK AND UNNATURAL
POWERS TO HANG ON

709
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
AND TAKE THE SECOND SPOT.

710
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
OUR BLIND BARBER STILL
STARING DOWN THE LUMBER TUMBLER.

711
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
AAH! YEAH!
AND HE MAKES IT INTO FOCUS.

712
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
STILL PLENTY OF ROOM FOR
THE BOLD. FOUR SPOTS LEFT, JOHN.

713
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
AT THE SNOW CHUTE, KATIE GAGA
READY TO GET COVERED IN BUBBLES.

714
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
ALEJANDRO!
AAH!

715
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
NO!
AH!

716
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
HERE'S A MATCH
MADE IN HEAVEN--

717
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
A VOICE ACTOR GUY
AND A GUY WHO HEARS VOICES.

718
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT,
I DON'T LIKE YOU!
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS!

719
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
MAYBE THEY CAN ALL ROOM
TOGETHER, SAVE ON THE RENT.

720
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
VOICE ACTOR JASON MAKES
A DESPERATE ATTEMPT...

721
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
WHOO!
AND GETS DISCOVERED!

722
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
HE'LL HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE
TO SHINE IN THE NEXT ROUND.
(Vanessa) ALL RIGHT!

723
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
ONLY THREE SPOTS LEFT.

724
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
LEONARD'S FRIEND CHRIS
SLIDES...

725
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
OHH!
OUCH! A SHOT TO THE HEAD.

726
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
BOY, THAT'S THE LAST THING
HE NEEDS.

727
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
WILD AND CRAZY AIMEE CHASING
THE CRAZY, AND...

728
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
YEAH!
AND YEAH! OH, HO HO!

729
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
YEAH! OUR FIRST GIRL
IS AIMEE.

730
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
FIRST GIRL
AND POTENTIALLY OUR LAST

731
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
'CAUSE ONLY TWO SPOTS REMAIN.
MR. GUM DOESN'T WANNA BLOW IT.

732
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
AND FOUR OUT OF FIVE DENTISTS
APPROVE!
HA!

733
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
YEAH! WHOO!
BUBBLICIOUS!

734
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
THAT MAN HAS
LONG-LASTING FLAVOR.
YEAH! WHOO!

735
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
WHO'S GONNA MAKE IT?

736
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
IF I KNEW, I COULD
EARN A LIVING AS A PSYCHIC

737
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
AND I WOULDN'T NEED
TO TALK TO YOU PEOPLE.

738
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
LEONARD'S FRIEND TRYING AGAIN.
WILL THESE TWO FIGURE IT OUT?

739
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
AH! OUT OF LUCK!
OH, HO!

740
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
IT'S A TIGHT BATTLE
FOR THE FINAL SPOT.

741
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
AT THE FOOTBRIDGE,
THE BLIND BARBER MAKES IT ACROSS

742
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
AND WALKS SMACK INTO A WALL.
WHOO!

743
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
THE NEXT ROUND
IN HIS SIGHTS...

744
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
OH, HE'S READY!
GO, STEFAN! GO!

745
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
HE'S... OH! KATIE GAGA
PUSHES IN FRONT!

746
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
HE DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.
A SLICK MOVE.

747
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
(cheering)
SHE IS SLIDING INTO
THE TOP SIX.

748
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
OH! KATIE GOT IT!

749
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
AND THE BLIND BARBER
CLOSES SHOP.

750
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
SHAVE AND A WIPEOUT--
TWO BITS.
TOP SIX, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

751
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
MOVING ON, JOHN, WE HAVE
THE TREASURE HUNTER TIM OSWALD,

752
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
THE DARK ARTIST JOE VAUX...
(thunderclap)

753
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
AND VOICE ACTOR JASON WISHNOV...

754
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
(Jason, deep voice)
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR?

755
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
WILD AND CRAZY AIMEE REILLY,

756
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
MR. GUM BRIAN AYA,

757
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
AND KATIE "GAGA" HELMUTH.

758
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
THESE SIX ARE THAT MUCH CLOSER
TO $50,000.

759
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
THEY HAVE PLENTY MORE HOOPS
TO FALL THROUGH

760
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
BEFORE WE SIGN THE CHECK.

761
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
(Joe) THIS IS
SUCH A CRUEL EVENT!

762
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
♪

763
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
WE ARE BACK WITH MORE
WINTER "WIPEOUT" JUST FOR YOU.

764
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
YEAH, AND I'M GLAD
THERE'S MORE.

765
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I WAS STARTING TO GET
THE SHAKES.

766
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I NEED MORE WIPEOUTS,
AND PROBABLY A LATTE.

767
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
THERE ARE
ONLY SIX CONTESTANTS LEFT,

768
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
AND THEY ARE ALL WILLING, JOHN,
TO GIVE YOU YOUR FIX OF FALLS.

769
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
STILL IN IT, WE HAVE
TREASURE HUNTER TIM OSWALD,

770
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
THE DARK ARTIST JOE VAUX...
AHH!

771
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
VOICE ACTOR JASON WISHNOV,

772
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
WILD AND CRAZY AIMEE REILLY...
(blows noisemaker)

773
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
MR. GUM BRIAN AYA,

774
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
AND KATIE "GAGA" HELMUTH.

775
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
(Katie) GAGA!

776
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
YOU KNOW, JOHN, A LOT OF PEOPLE
MAKE FUN OF THE GAGA...

777
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
HMM.
FOR THOSE OUTRAGEOUS OUTFITS.

778
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
BUT MEAT PRODUCTS ARE
SURPRISINGLY WARM.

779
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I HAVE ALL OF MY JACKETS MADE
WITH A BOLOGNA LINING.

780
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

781
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
NO.

782
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
ALL RIGHT. YOUR LOSS.

783
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
BY THE WAY, YOU WANT
SOME BEEF JERKY?

784
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
MY PANTS ARE LINED
WITH DRIED BEEF.

785
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I FEEL CONFIDENT IN SAYING

786
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
THAT I WILL NEVER WANT FOOD
FROM YOUR TROUSERS.

787
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
(mouth full) YOUR LOSS.

788
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
LET ME KNOW
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

789
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
PLENTY MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

790
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET DOWN
TO OUR NEXT OBSTACLE--

791
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
THE COLDHEARTED SNAKE.

792
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
(exhales)
LOOK AT HIS BREATH, JOHN.

793
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
HE GETS MORE COLDHEARTED
THE FURTHER WE GET INTO WINTER.
(rattles)

794
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
WELL, HERE'S HOW
THIS ONE WORKS.

795
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
CONTESTANTS WILL FIRST FACE

796
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
OUR TWO SLITHERING,
SPINNING SNOW SWEEPERS.
AAH! YEAH!

797
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
MAKE THE PLATFORM, AND IT'S UP
TO PLUMMET SUMMIT--

798
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
THE ENORMOUS BELLY
OF THE SNAKE.
AAH!

799
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
AVOID DIGESTION, SLIDE DOWN
THE SERPENT'S SLIPPERY BACK.
WHEE!

800
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
(exhales)
THEN IT'S OVER TO
THE SHIVERING TIMBERS.

801
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
BOUNCE OFF A GIANT SNOWBALL,
MAKE IT TO THE FINISH PLATFORM,

802
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
AND YOU, MY FRIEND...
WHOO-HOO!

803
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
HAVE MADE IT
TO THE WIPEOUT...

804
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
(rattles)
"S-S-S-SONE."

805
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
"S-S-S-SONE," JOHN?

806
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
YESSS.

807
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
FIRST THREE
TO GET PAST THE SNAKE

808
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
WILL ENTER THE WIPEOUT ZONE.

809
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
S-S-S-SONE.

810
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
S-S-S-SONE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

811
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE UNTIED
TONGUE OF VANESSA LACEY.

812
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
S-S-S-SONE.

813
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
OKAY, GUYS, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE CONTESTANTS ARE IN POSITION,

814
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
AND THE COLDHEARTED SNAKE
IS READY TO STRIKE.

815
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
(exhales)

816
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
WHO WANTS TO--
WHO'S GONNA JUMP FIRST?

817
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
ANYONE WANT TO JUST SAY
THEY'RE GONNA JUMP FIRST?

818
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
(air horn blows)
HEY!

819
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
KATIE GAGA, IF YOU ASK FIRST,
YOU'RE GONNA END UP LAST.

820
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
TREASURE HUNTER TIM OSWALD'S
OUT FRONT...
(groans)

821
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
FOLLOWED BY THE VOICE ACTOR
JASON WISHNOV.

822
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
OH, HO HO!
OOH, HOO!
RIGHT IN HIS TREASURE CHEST.

823
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
GOOD LANDING.

BECAUSE NORMALLY, YOU SEE--

824
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
OHH!

825
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
AAH!

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
OOH, HOO HOO! AND THAT.
HOLY CRAP! AAH!

828
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
AH, HA HA!

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
LOOK OUT!
TREASURE HUNTER A GREAT CHANCE

830
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
WHOO!
HE SHOULD HAVE AN ADVANTAGE
HERE, JOHN.

831
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
THIS IS JUST LIKE DIVING
FOR SUNKEN TREASURE.
MM-HMM.

832
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
ONLY THERE'S NO WATER
AND IT'S MORE OF A SLIDE.

833
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
UHH!
OHH, HO!

834
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
OHH!
I SAID "SLIDE," MAN!

835
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
THAT'S A STROKE OF LUCK
FOR DARK ARTIST.

836
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
TAKES ADVANTAGE OF HIS
GOOD FORTUNE WITH AS ARTSY MOVE.

837
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
MR. GUM TRYING
TO CHEW AWAY AT HIS LEAD,

838
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
BUT HE IS IN A STICKY SITUATION
AT THE SWEEPER ARM.
MM-HMM.

839
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
HE BETTER SCRAPE HIMSELF OFF.
(Vanessa) OOH!

840
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
OHH!
OHH, HO HO!

841
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000

OH!
OH, HO HO!

846
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
DOING THE SAME THING
OVER AND OVER

847
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
AND EXPECTING
DIFFERENT RESULTS.

848
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
THE DARK ARTIST...
OH, GOD!

849
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
AH! JUST ERASED HIS LEAD.
OH, HOO!

850
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
THE TREASURE HUNTER
ACTUALLY SLIDING THIS TIME.

851
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
WOW!
YEAH, A LITTLE MORE GENTLE
WITH THE JUNK IN HIS TRUNK,

852
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
AND HE IS MAKING IT DOWN
THE COLDHEARTED SNAKE.

853
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
RIGHT BEHIND AND READY TO SOAR
IS KATIE GAGA.

854
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
(Vanessa) KATIE!
OH, MY GOSH!

855
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000

00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
SO I HAVE TO GO AGAIN?

858
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
SORRY. ONLY ACTUAL CELEBRITIES
GET CELEBRITY TREATMENT.

859
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
(man) OH, GOD!

860
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
THE DARK ARTIST
IS GOING AT IT AGAIN.

861
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
HE'S ON THE SNOWBALL.

862
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
(Vanessa) GO!
JUST ONE GIANT LEAP LEFT.

863
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
YES!
YEAH!

864
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
THE DARK ARTIST FIRST TO QUALIFY
FOR THE WIPEOUT ZONE.

865
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
AND LOOKING TO JOIN HIM
IS MR. GUM.

866
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
OOH! UHH!

867
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
OOH, HO HO!

868
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000

870
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
(high-pitched voice) DAMN!

871
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
KATIE GAGA COMING AROUND.

872
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
HERE WE GO. KATIE AGAIN.
SHE'S A ROCK STAR.

873
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
WHOO!
IMPERSONATOR.

874
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
BUT KATIE GAGA TAKES
CENTER STAGE.

875
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
(Jason) GREAT JOB, KATIE!
(Aimee) YEAH, KATIE!

876
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
IS THE VOICE ACTOR SERIOUSLY
TRYING TO NETWORK FROM UP THERE?

877
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
GREAT JOB!
YOU KNOW,
THE KEY TO NETWORKING

878
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
IS TO MAKE
A GREAT FIRST IMPRESSION.

879
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
MM!
OOH!

880
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
(man) THAT ONE HURT.

881
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
AH, LOOK,
IT'S WILD AND CRAZY AIMEE.

882
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
IS SHE SEEKING ASYLUM
ON THAT OBSTACLE?

883
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'M SO OVER THIS. AAH!
NO, APPARENTLY NOT.

884
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
MR. GUM AIMING FOR A BETTER
RESULT THE SECOND TIME AROUND.

885
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
WILL HE GET IT?

886
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
OH, NO!
OHH, HO!

887
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
HEY! DID HE JUST STICK HIS GUM
UNDER THE OBSTACLE?

888
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
YOU KNOW, I GOTTA
CLEAN THAT UP LATER!

889
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
JOHNNY, CALL ME CRAZY,

890
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE AIMEE IS
COMING DOWN PLUMMET SUMMIT.

891
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
DOES THAT COUNT?

892
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
YEAH.

893
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
WELL, IF KATIE GAGA
SAYS SO...

894
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
AND I THINK KATIE GAGA
IS ABOUT TO TAKE CHARGE AGAIN.

895
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
OH, HO! THAT IS JUST
GAGA BEING GAGA.
OHH!

896
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
THE TREASURE HUNTER
RISING TO THE OCCASION.

897
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
OH! GONNA GIVE HIMSELF
A LITTLE RUNNING ROOM.

898
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
OH!

899
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
EE! AH! NO!
OHH!

900
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
OHH!

901
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
LESS MUSCLE, TIM!
LOOK OUT FROM ABOVE!

902
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
IT'S MR. GUM.

903
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
AND THIS TIME,
HE STICKS THE LANDING.

904
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
YES!

905
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
HE DO.HE'S GOT SPEARMINT.
YES, HE DO.

906
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
HE'S GOT SPEARMINT.
HOW ABOUT YOU?

907
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
WHOO!
(man) THERE YOU GO, BABY!

908
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
WHOO!

909
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
TWO MORE SPOTS.

910
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
BRIAN, VANESSA PROMISED
TO KISS YOU IF YOU MAKE IT!

911
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
(boing)
IS THAT RIGHT?

912
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
ALMOST POSITIVE
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

913
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
JOHN, WOULD YOU BELIEVE
DULL AND BORING WINS THE RACE?

914
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
WILD AND CRAZY AIMEE
COMING FROM WAY BACK.

915
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
A WIPEOUT ZONE SPOT
ONE DARING DIVE AWAY...

916
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
OH, YEAH!
WOW!

917
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
CRAZY AIMEE ACTUALLY MADE IT!
THAT'S NUTS.

918
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
ONLY ONE PRECIOUS WIPEOUT ZONE
OPENING REMAINS.

919
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
JOHNNY, EVEN THE VOICE ACTOR'S
GOT A SHOT.

920
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
COME ON!
I DON'T KNOW.

921
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
THAT MR. GUM IS
CHOMPING AT THE BIT.

922
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
IT AIN'T OVER YET!
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

923
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
THERE IS A SHOWDOWN COMING,

924
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
AND MR. GUM IS CREATING
A WHOLE WAD OF TENSION.

925
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I GOT IT!
PATIENCE.

926
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
(man) GO, GO, GO!
HE'S OFF AND HE'S...

927
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
(man) YES!
I GOT IT!

928
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
YEAH, GOT IT.

929
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
WAY TO GRAB THE BALL.
HOW'D YOU DO IT?

930
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
UH-OH, HE'S ASKING FOR HELP
FROM THE DARK SIDE.
HOW'D YOU DO IT?
DID YOU JUST JUMP?

931
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
GIVE IT A LITTLE BOUNCE.
JUMP!

932
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
JUST FEEL IT OUT.
FEEL A LITTLE BOUNCE.
JUMP! JUMP!

933
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
MR. GUM CAN END THE FINAL SPOT
SUSPENSE RIGHT HERE.

934
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
COME ON, SHAKE THE BALL!

935
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
GO! GO ON. GET HIM. GO GET HIM.
I CAN'T. HE'S ON THE BALL.

936
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
KNOCK HIM OFF.
UH-OH! LOOKS LIKE GAGA
DIDN'T GET TO THE TOP

937
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
WITHOUT KNOCKING A FEW PEOPLE
DOWN, JOHNNY.

938
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
KNOCK HIM OFF. GO!

939
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
YOU CAN'T KNOCK ME OFF!
I GOT IT!

940
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
MAYBE NOT HER, BUT KATIE GAGA
HAS OTHERS TO DO HER DIRTY WORK.

941
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
GET HIM OFF. GET HIM OFF.
GO. GO, GO! GO.

942
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
SHE'S TALKED THE VOICE ACTOR
INTO IT.

943
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
ATTACKS FROM BEHIND!

944
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
NO!
OH, HO HO!

945
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
THAT WAS CRUEL!

946
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
NOW KATIE GAGA SENDING IN
ANOTHER MINION.
UH-OH.

947
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
HERE COMES
THE TREASURE HUNTER.

948
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
(Katie) JUMP! JUMP!
GET OUT OF THERE!

949
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
MR. GUM FORCED TO MOVE.

950
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
OH, HO HO!
OH, HO! NO!

951
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
JOHN, THE MEN SEDUCED AND RUINED
BY THE POWER OF KATIE GAGA.

952
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
THE COAST IS NOW CLEAR
FOR HER TO CLAIM VICTORY.

953
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
HOPPING ONTO THE SNOWBALL.
(Joe, high-pitched voice)
COME ON, KATIE, YOU CAN DO IT!

954
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
HER MISCHIEVOUS PLOT
A LEAP FROM COMPLETION.

955
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
AAH!
OH, HO HO!

956
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
OHH!

957
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
(Aimee)
THAT WAS STRAIGHT IN HER FACE.

958
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
(Joe) SHE WAS COMBING HER HAIR
WITH HER TOES!

959
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
REALLY? ONLY A DARK ARTIST
WOULD GO THERE.

960
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
(smack, crunch)

961
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
OH. NO, TECHNICALLY,
HE'S RIGHT.

962
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
AAH!
(Joe) OW!

963
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
WELL, WITH THE COLDHEARTED SNAKE
AND SLY TEMPTRESS

964
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
BOTH OUT OF HIS WAY,

965
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
TREASURE HUNTER CAN NOW CLAIM
THE FINAL SPOT.

966
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
SAFELY ON THE SNOWBALL.

967
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
(Joe and Aimee) YES! YES!

968
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
STILL VULNERABLE.

969
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
(Katie) KNOCK HIM OFF, DUDE.

970
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
UH-OH.
HE KNOCKED YOU OFF.

971
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
OH, BOY. MR. GUM IS LIKE
PUTTY IN HER HANDS, JOHNNY.

972
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
HERE HE GOES!
INCOMING!

973
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
OH, HO HO!

974
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
AH, HA!

975
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
LOOK OUT!
THIS IS SUCH A CRUEL EVENT!

976
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
MR. GUM HAS BEEN IN A LOT
OF STICKY SITUATIONS BEFORE,

977
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
BUT I'M GUESSING
HE NEVER IMAGINED THIS.

978
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
(Brian, slo-mo voice) OW!

979
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
NOW THAT IS
SOME BURIED TREASURE.

980
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
(Joe) LOOK OUT!
AAH!

981
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
NOW MR. GUM BETTER HURRY,

982
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
BECAUSE THE MANIPULATIVE
KATIE GAGA

983
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
IS PREPARED TO DO
HER OWN DIRTY WORK.

984
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
HERE SHE COMES, JOHNNY!
(Joe) GET OUT OF THERE, BRIAN!

985
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
MR. GUM'S GOT TROUBLE
ON TWO FRONTS.

986
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
FLINGING HIMSELF
IN THE FINAL SPOT!

987
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
OHH! KATIE GAGA GOES DOWN!

988
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
OHH!
ALMOST!

989
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
YEAH! YEAH!
AND MR. GUM IT IS!

990
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
WHOO!
(Vanessa speaks indistinctly)

991
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
YEAH!

992
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
THIS IS IT!
NO, IT'S NOT.

993
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
THIS IS MY ONE SHOT.
NO, DUDE, IT'S--

994
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
IF I DON'T MAKE IT NOW,
IT'S OVER.

995
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
IT'S ALREADY OVER, VOICE ACTOR.
TOTALLY OVER.

996
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
YEAH. HE IS SO DRAMATIC.

997
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
HE FELL ON YOUR FACE!

998
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
KISS MY HELMET.
KISS MY HELMET.
OKAY, WAIT.

999
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
AH! DON'T DO THAT, VANESSA.

1000
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
REMEMBER WHERE IT'S BEEN.
AAH!

1001
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
(Joe) WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
USE HIS HEAD!

1002
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
SO OUR FINALISTS ARE SET--

1003
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
WILD AND CRAZY AIMEE REILLY,

1004
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
MR. GUM BRIAN AYA,

1005
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
AND THE DARK ARTIST JOE VAUX.

1006
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
STICK AROUND

1007
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
FOR THE CRAZIEST, DARKEST,
GUMMIEST WIPEOUT ZONE EVER.

1008
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It's time to free ourselves
from the smell

1009
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and harshness of bleach.

1010
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And free ourselves from worrying
about the ones we love.

1011
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
New Lysol Power & Free has more

1012
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
cleaning power than bleach.

1013
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
How?

1014
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
The secret
is the hydrogen peroxide
formula.

1015
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
It attacks tough stains

1016
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and kills 99.9% of germs.

1017
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
New Lysol Power & Free.

1018
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Powerful cleaning that's
family friendly.

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Another step forward
in our Mission for Health.

1020
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Every human being
is unique.

1021
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000

1046

WE ARE BACK
ON WINTER "WIPEOUT"...

1047
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
AFTER DARK.
THAT'S RIGHT.

1048
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
WE STARTED THIS BLUSTERY DAY
WITH 24 HOPEFUL CONTESTANTS.

1049
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
NOW WE'RE DOWN TO JUST THREE

1050
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
STILL DUKING IT OUT
FOR THAT $50,000 CHECK.

1051
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
NEXT UP, THEY FACE DOWN
THE FINAL CHALLENGE--

1052
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
OUR WINTER WIPEOUT ZONE.

1053
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
AND THIS STUNNER STARTS
WITH A 7-STORY DROP

1054
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
STRAIGHT DOWN KILLER LUGE.

1055
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
FROM THERE, IT'S ON TO
THE PSYCHEDELIC SNOW GLOBE,

1056
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
WHERE CONTESTANTS MUST
TAG THE CENTER

1057
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
IN ORDER TO DROP
THE EXIT PLATFORM.

1058
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
NEXT, IT'S AN UPHILL BATTLE
ON THE FROZEN FURY

1059
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
TO MAKE IT TO THE OTHER SIDE.

1060
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
AND FINALLY, ICED OVER.

1061
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
NAVIGATE ACROSS THESE REVOLVING
DIAMONDS TO THE FINISH PLATFORM.

1062
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
TIME TO FIND OUT

1063
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
WHICH OF THESE FINAL THREE
WILL GO HOME AS OUR CHAMPION.

1064
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
UP FIRST--WILD AND CRAZY
AIMEE REILLY.

1065
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
WHOO! WIPEOUT ZONE!

1066
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
LET'S LOOK BACK AT HOW SHE GOT
TO THE WIPEOUT ZONE.

1067
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'M CRAZY!

1068
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
AIMEE REILLY STARTED THE DAY
CLAIMING TO BE WILD AND CRAZY...

1069
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
AAH!
SHOWING OFF
SOME INSANE WIPEOUTS.

1070
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
UHH! AAH!

1071
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
OVERCOMING EXPECTATIONS,

1072
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
SHE PULLED HERSELF TOGETHER
ON PAIN IN THE ICE.

1073
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I'M CRAZY!

1074
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
AND AFTER A WILD RIDE
ON THE COLDHEARTED SNAKE,

1075
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
SHE IS ON HER WAY
TO THE WIPEOUT ZONE.

1076
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
(man) OHH!

1077
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
KILLER LUGE LOOKS
AWFULLY IMPOSING.
LLY IMPOSING.

1078
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
WILD AND CRAZY AIMEE--

1079
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
SHE'S GOTTA BE HALF-MAD
TO SIT UP THERE.

1080
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
OH. MY. GOD.

1081
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
WHAT'S THE MATTER? NEVER DROPPED
7 STORIES AT 35 MILES PER HOUR

1082
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
ON A KILLER LUGE BEFORE?
(beeping)

1083
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
A BUNDLE OF NERVES.
HERE'S THE COUNTDOWN.
(beep)

1084
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
AND WILD AND CRAZY GOES DOWN.
ONLY ONE WAY OFF.

1085
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
AAH!

1086
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
WHOA!
WHOA, HO HO!

1087
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
THAT'S WHAT'S KNOWN
AS THE CALL OF THE WILD.

1088
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
AAH!

1089
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
ALMOST MORE OF
A SHRIEK OF THE WILD, REALLY?.

1090
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
WOW, THAT WAS QUITE A HIT.

1091
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
REALLY A TOUGH LANDING.

1092
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
PSYCHEDELIC SNOW GLOBE
DOESN'T CARE.

1093
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
STILL SHAKING OFF THE EFFECTS
OF THAT WATER LANDING,

1094
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
BUT SHE HAS MADE IT
INTO THE GLOBE.

1095
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
NICE FIRST MOVE, WORKING HER WAY
TO THE CENTER.

1096
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
THE BUTTON RELEASES
THE EXIT PLATFORM.

1097
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
REACHING AND JUST GETS
A PIECE OF IT.

1098
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
OHH!
OH! GOT INTO THE ROTATION.
A MEAN DOUBLE HIT.

1099
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
AAH!
DON'T THINK OF IT AS LOSING
YOUR BALANCE, WILD AND CRAZY.

1100
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
THINK OF IT AS FINDING
YOUR IMBALANCE.

1101
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
SO IT'S TWO ATTEMPTS, AT LEAST,
ON THE GLOBE.

1102
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
HER TIME ALREADY HEFTY--
PAST THE 5-MINUTE MARK.

1103
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
SHE'S STAYING HIGH THIS TIME,
EXIT PLATFORM IN PLACE.

1104
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
AN EASY RIDE.
HERE COMES THE DISMOUNT.

1105
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
UHH!
YES!

1106
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
WILD AND CRAZY CAN MOVE UP
TO THE FROZEN FURY.

1107
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
THERE'S ICE UP HERE.

1108
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
YEAH, IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA
OF THE CONDITIONS TONIGHT.

1109
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
IT IS BITTER COLD OUT.

1110
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

1111
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
THAT IS A FREQUENT QUESTION.

1112
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
PLATFORMS TILTED
TO MATCH THE TEMPERATURE--

1113
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
ABOUT 30 DEGREES.
UHH!

1114
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
OH! EARLY WIPEOUT, JOHN.

1115
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
YEAH, THE FROZEN FURY
DECLARING

1116
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
WILD AND CRAZY
INCOMPETENT...
UHH!

1117
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
AND SHE TOOK A PLATFORM
TO THE TEETH.

1118
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
AND AS SHE FINISHES
HER 18-FOOT CLIMB

1119
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
BACK TO THAT
ICE-SLICKED PLATFORM,

1120
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
HER TIME TRIPS
PAST 9 MINUTES.

1121
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
FROZEN FURY
STILL IN FRONT OF HER.

1122
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
UHH! OH, MY GOD.

1123
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
AIMEE CLEARLY FEELING
THE FATIGUE

1124
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
AFTER THOSE LONG COLD SWIMS.

1125
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
SHE IS REALLY STRUGGLING
TO GET OVER THOSE BARS.

1126
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
YEAH, JOHN, THAT COLD HURTS.

1127
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
EXHAUSTION THE ENEMY,
BUT SHE KEEPS PUSHING FORWARD.

1128
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
ONE MORE PLATFORM LEFT.

1129
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
AIMEE JUST WILLING HERSELF
OVER THAT BAR.

1130
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
YEAH!

1131
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
NOW ONLY ICED OVER REMAINS,

1132
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
AS WILD AND CRAZY AIMS
TO ESTABLISH

1133
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
THE OPENING TIME TO BEAT.

1134
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
WILD AND CRAZY GOING FOR IT.

1135
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
WHAT WAS THAT?
AND LOOKING A LITTLE STARTLED.

1136
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
OHH!
OH, HO! MAN!

1137
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
AND THAT QUICKLY HALTS
THE PROGRESS ON THIS RUN.

1138
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
WHAT WAS THAT?
YEAH, AIMEE LOSES HER GRIP,

1139
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
AND WHAT FEW WITS SHE HAD LEFT,
SHE GETS TOSSED INTO THE DRINK.

1140
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
AND DOWN THERE,
THAT SWIMMING YOU DON'T SEE

1141
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
IS WHERE THE CLOCK
REALLY TAKES A BEATING.

1142
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
SECOND ATTEMPT NOW.

1143
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
TIME ALREADY
AT 14 MINUTES, 47 SECONDS.

1144
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
UHH!

1145
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
AIMEE IS RIGHT OUT
ON THAT FIRST DIAMOND,

1146
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
MAKE MAKING A JUMP
FOR THE SECOND.

1147
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
OH!
OH! GETS A FACE FULL OF PLATFORM
THERE, BUT SHE IS UP

1148
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
AND QUICKLY OVER TO
THAT THIRD DIAMOND.

1149
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
SHE HAS ONE MORE JUMP
TO THE FINISH. OH!

1150
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
UHH!
WILD AND CRAZY AIMEE
PULLING HERSELF UP.

1151
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
WHOO!
PUTS UP A TIME
OF 15 MINUTES, 5 SECONDS.

1152
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
AND NOW WE'LL SEE
IF IT STANDS UP.
WHOO!

1153
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
YEAH, HOPING TO BEAT
THAT TIME--MR. GUM BRIAN AYA.

1154
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
YEAH, LET'S DO THIS! ALL RIGHT!
YEAH! I GOT THIS ONE!

1155
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HIS DAY.
WHOO! "WIPEOUT"!

1156
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
MR. GUM BRIAN AYA PULLED OUT
FROM THE PACK TODAY

1157
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
WHEN HE EASILY COMPLETED
OUR QUALIFIER.

1158
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
UHH! AAH!

1159
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
HIS BUBBLE ALMOST BURST
AT PAIN IN THE ICE.

1160
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
UHH!
THEN HIS MINTY FRESH ATTITUDE

1161
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
PUSHED HIM THROUGH
THE COLDHEARTED SNAKE.

1162
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
NOW HE'S FACING DOWN
THE ULTIMATE STICKY SITUATION

1163
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
IN THE WIPEOUT ZONE.

1164
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
YEAH!

1165
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
MR. GUM READY TO GO
ATOP KILLER LUGE.

1166
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
15 MINUTES, 5 SECONDS
THE TIME TO BEAT.

1167
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
(beeping)
LIGHTS, CAMERA, GRAVITY!

1168
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
(beep)
MR. GUM SHOVES OFF.

1169
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
YEAH, AND THE PHYSICS OF FALLING
ARE NOW IN CHARGE.

1170
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I LOVE YOU, MOM!

1171
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
(laughs) YEAH.
(laughs) YEAH.
TAKE A LISTEN, JOHN.

1172
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
IN THE MIDST OF
A 80-FOOT DROP,

1173
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
HE USES THAT CLASSIC LINE...
I LOVE YOU, MOM!

1174
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
AND GIVES A SHOUT-OUT
TO HIS MOM.

1175
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
WHAT A GUY.

1176
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
COME ON. I CAN DO IT.

1177
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
REALLY? YOU CAN DO
THE PSYCHEDELIC SNOW GLOBE

1178
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
AND CHEW GUM
AT THE SAME TIME?

1179
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
OH, MY GOD!
HOW DO YOU DO THIS?

1180
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
NOT SURE THERE'S A MANUAL.

1181
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
OHH! THE GLOBE
SPITS HIM RIGHT OUT.
OH!

1182
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
SO MUCH
FOR HIGH EXPECTORATIONS.

1183
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
MR. GUM GUMMED UP THAT ENTRY
AND HAD NOTHING TO HOLD ON TO.

1184
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
YEAH, BUT HE WANTS ANOTHER PIECE
OF THIS THING, JOHNNY.

1185
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
CLOCK SHOWS 4:20.

1186
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
THIS WAY.

1187
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
OOH!
OH! TRYING SOMETHING
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

1188
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
HE'S GOTTA MAKE IT DOWN
TO THE CENTER AND TOUCH THE--

1189
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
AAH!
OH, HO!

1190
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
OHH! WOW!

1191
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
BRIAN SLIPS UP AGAIN...

1192
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
AAH!

1193
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
AND JUST GOES FLAILING
INTO THAT BONE-CHILLING WATER.

1194
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I CAN DO THIS.

1195
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
THIRD TRY.
CLOCK APPROACHING 7 MINUTES.

1196
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
GIVING THE GLOBE
ANOTHER SHAKE.

1197
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
STILL HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE NEAR
THE CENTER BUTTON

1198
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
TO RELEASE
THAT EXIT PLATFORM.

1199
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
OH! SMOOTH HE IS NOT.
OOH.

1200
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I HIT IT!

1201
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
FINALLY!
I GOT IT! I CAN DO IT!

1202
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
ALL RIGHT, NOW HE'S GOTTA TRY
AND RIDE--

1203
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
OHH!
OHH, MAN!

1204
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
MR. GUM
A LITTLE TOO CONFIDENT

1205
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
AND JUST MISSED THAT STEP
COMPLETELY.

1206
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
THIS IS HIS FOURTH ATTEMPT

1207
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
ON THE PSYCHEDELIC SNOW GLOBE,
JOHN.

1208
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
MIGHT BE A RECORD.

1209
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
DOESN'T HAVE TO MESS
WITH THAT CENTER ANYMORE,

1210
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
WHICH IS NICE.
JUST GET ON AND GET OFF.

1211
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
MAKING SURE HE'S GOT BOTH FEET
FIRMLY PLANTED.

1212
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
AND FINALLY,
HE IS ON TO THE FROZEN FURY.
WHOO! I DID IT!

1213
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
THAT'S GOOD, BUT HE IS STILL
FAR OFF THE LEADER'S PACE.

1214
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
HE'S PROBABLY GETTING COLD
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.
(laughs)

1215
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
MY HANDS ARE FREEZING!

1216
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
NOT JUST FIGHTING THE ELEMENTS,
JOHN. HE IS FIGHTING THE CLOCK.

1217
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
MR. GUM NOW LESS THAN 5 MINUTES
TO FINISH THE ZONE.

1218
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
YEP, AND FROZEN FURY--

1219
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
OH, HO!
NO! HE'S DOWN AGAIN!

1220
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
YEAH, THAT COLD WEATHER IS
STARTING TO AFFECT HIS REFLEXES

1221
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
BECAUSE THAT WAS A CASE
OF TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE.

1222
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
DON'T GIVE UP.
YEAH, AND ATTEMPT NUMBER TWO,

1223
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
AND MR. GUM HAS LESS THAN
2 MINUTES TO FINISH THE COURSE.

1224
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
CLEVER HOP OVER THE BAR THERE.

1225
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
MR. GUM MAY BE GETTING
THE HANG OF THIS ONE.

1226
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
AND HE BETTER, JOHNNY.

1227
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
HE STILL HAS ONE OBSTACLE TO GO
AND NO TIME FOR WIPEOUTS.

1228
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
AAH!

1229
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
LUNGS BURNING, MUSCLES ACHING.

1230
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
HIS BODY REALLY GETTING PUSHED
TO THE LIMIT HERE.

1231
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
AAH!
UP AND OVER. ONWARD HE GOES.

1232
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
MR. GUM--HE CAN MAKE A GAME
OUT OF THIS AFTER ALL.

1233
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
HE COMPLETES THE FROZEN FURY.

1234
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
DID IT.

1235
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
TAKE YOUR TIME. IT'S OKAY.
(laughs)

1236
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
BRIAN'S GOT LESS THAN 30 SECONDS
TO CLEAR ICED OVER, JOHN.

1237
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
READY TO TRANSITION FROM
THAT FIRST TO SECOND DIAMOND.

1238
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
OH!
AH! OVER!

1239
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
MR. GUM JUST COULDN'T GET
BOTH LEGS UP ONTO THAT DIAMOND,

1240
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
AND LOST HIS BALANCE
AND HIS CHANCE AT THE 50K.

1241
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
(air horn blows)

1242
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
THE SOUND OF THE HORN OFFICIALLY
SOUNDS THE END FOR MR. GUM.

1243
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
WILD AND CRAZY AIMEE REILLY
REMAINS OUR LEADER.

1244
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
BUT IS HER TIME
OF 15 MINUTES, 5 SECONDS

1245
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
GOOD ENOUGH TO HOLD UP AGAINST
THE DARK ARTIST?

1246
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
WE'LL FIND OUT FOR SURE
RIGHT AFTER THIS.

1247
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
.

1248

♪

1249
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
WELCOME BACK
TO WINTER "WIPEOUT,"

1250
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
AND SOMEBODY'S ABOUT
TO GET PAID.

1251
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
THAT'S RIGHT.

1252
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
WE ARE JUST ONE RUN AWAY FROM
HANDING OUT OUR $50,000 PRIZE.

WILD AND CRAZY AIMEE REILLY

LOOKING TO CHANGE THAT--
WOUR FINAL COMPETITOR,

JOE VAUX, THE DARK ARTIST.

1256
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
(mouth full) I'M READY.
I CAN'T TALK, BUT I'M READY.

1257
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
LET'S REVIEW HIS JOURNEY
TO THE ZONE.

1258
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
(thunderclap)
WHOO!

1259
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
JOE VAUX, THE DARK ARTIST,
CREEPED EVERYONE OUT

1260
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
WITH HIS RUN ON THE QUALIF.

1261
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
HE SHOWED US HIS DIABOLICAL
VISION ON PAIN IN THE ICE.

1262
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
AND BROUGHT DARKNESS
TO THE COLDHEARTED SNAKE.

1263
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
NOW AFTER A LONG DAY
OF WIPEOUTS,

1264
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
HE'S HOPING TO COMPLETE
HIS SINISTER MASTERPIECE

1265
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
IN THE WIPEOUT ZONE.
AAH! UHH!

1266
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
KILLER LUGE OMINOUS-LOOKING
FROM DOWN BELOW.

1267
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
(grunts and laughs)
AND FAR WORSE FROM UP TOP.

1268
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
TOTALLY NERVE-RACKING.

1269
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
15:05
THE $50,000 TIME TO BEAT.
(beeping)

1270
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
(beep)
BRIGHT LIGHTS, DARK ARTIST.

1271
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
AAH!

1272
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
YEAH! THERE YOU GO!
AAH!

1273
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
WHOA, HO!
TURN HIM LOOSE
AND INTO THE NIGHT!

1274
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
THE DARK ARTIST GOES FOR A RIDE
DOWN KILLER LUGE,

1275
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
AND ALMOST DOES A 180...
OOH!

1276
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
BEFORE ENTERING THE DARK WATERS
OF THE WIPEOUT ZONE.

1277
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
QUICKLY OUT OF THAT WATER
AND UP THE LADDER.

1278
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
PSYCHEDELIC SNOW GLOBE
SPINNING.

1279
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
RIGHT INTO IT.

1280
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
UP ON ENTRY BUT UNDETERRED
TO THE CENTER BUTTON.

1281
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
(high-pitched laugh)

1282
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
AND WITH A CREEPY CACKLE,
HE TAGS--
UH-OH!

1283
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
OHH!
OH, NO!

1284
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
OH, THE DARK ARTIST NO MATCH

1285
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
FOR THE PSYCHEDELIC SNOW GLOBE,
JOHNNY.

1286
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
AAH!

1287
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
HE BETTER GET HIMSELF READY
FOR ROUND TWO.

1288
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
EVERYBODY TAKING MULTIPLE TRIES
ON THE GLOBE TONIGHT.

1289
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
3 MINUTES GONE BY.

1290
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
JOE STAYING HIGH AS THE EXIT
PLATFORM IS ALREADY DOWN

1291
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
AND IN THE READY POSITION.

1292
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
JUMPS...

1293
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
HEY! FINE THIS TIME.

1294
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
OOH, HE'S KINDA BOOKING IT.

1295
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I'LL SAY.
HE IS OPENING UP A LEAD

1296
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
ON THE PACE SET
BY WILD AND CRAZY.

1297
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
AT THE FROZEN FURY NOW.

1298
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
HE'S UP AND OVER--OHH!
OHH! WOW.

1299
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
NO. DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

1300
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
THE DARK ARTIST LOOKED LIKE
HE HAD IT,

1301
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
BUT CAUGHT HIS LEG
AND LANDED HARD.

1302
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
SO HE WILL TAKE A COUPLE OF
SHOTS AT FROZEN FURY AS WELL.

1303
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
NO ISSUE
WITH THE FIRST BAR THERE.

1304
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
DON'T FORGET THIS OBSTACLE
IS AT AN INCLINE, JOHNNY.

1305
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
SO HE IS TRULY FIGHTING
AN UPHILL BATTLE.

1306
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
HE'S ONLY 7 MINUTES IN, JOHN,

1307
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
BUT YOU CAN GET ALL KINDS
OF WORN OUT IN A SHORT TIME

1308
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
HERE IN THE ZONE.

1309
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
SETTING HIMSELF UP IN
GREAT POSITION TO WIN THE CASH.

1310
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
THE PATH IS CLEAR NOW.

THE FINAL OBSTACLE,

1314
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000

HIMSELF BACK TO THE START

1322
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
HERE AT ICED OVER.

1323

MUCH BETTER.

00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
HE'S IN GOOD POSITION.

1325
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000

AH, BUT HE CALMLY BACKTRACKS.

1331
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
RISKY STRATEGY.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

1332
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
IF IT WORKS, HE BUYS HIMSELF
SOME TIME FOR THAT FINAL JUMP.

1333

AH!
HOW GOOD IS THAT?
