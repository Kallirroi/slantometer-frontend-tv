00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
>>> ALL THATHS HAPPENED IN THE

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
PAST TWO DAYS IS ENOUGH TO MAKE

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
YOU SHAKE YOUR HEAD AND STARE AT

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
THE TELEVISION AND WONDER WHAT

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
HAPPENED TO THIS WORLD.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
WE WANT TO END THIS HOUR WITH

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
THE REMINDER THAT THERE ARE GOOD

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
PEOPLE AND POSITIVE ACTS OF

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
KINDNESS THAT ARE HAPPENING

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
EVERYWHERE.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
REMEMBER THIS, LAST MONTH THE

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
NEW YORK CITY POLICE OFFICER

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
OFFERED A HOMELESS MAN A PAIR OF

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
BOOTS ON A COLD NIGHT.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
OR A TENNESSEE BOY WHO HELPED

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
HIS BROTHER COMPLETE IN A

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
TRIATHLON AND WHO COULD FORGET

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
THIS LIBYAN CHILD WHO DOESN'T

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
BELIEVE IN HATE HOLDING A SIGN

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
APOLOGIZING FOR THE EMBASSY

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
ATTACK IN BENGHAZI.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
SO MUCH TO BE THANKFUL FOR EVEN

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
WE CONTINUE OUR COVERAGE OF THE

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
CONNECTICUT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
SHOOTING RIGHT NOW.

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
>>> GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'M JOHN BERMAN.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
WE'RE IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT,

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
THIS MORNING.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
>> I'M KATE BOLDUAN.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
YOU'RE WATCHING OUR CONTINUING

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
COVERAGE.
IT FEELS LIKE WE'VE BEEN HERE A

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
LONG TIME JUST TRYING TO FIGURE

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
STORY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL BE COMING

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000

AND WE'RE TOLD HE WILL SPEAK AT

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
A VIGIL BEING HELD TONIGHT.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
MEANWHILE, THE COMMUNITY IS

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
GRIEVING.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
WE SAW MORE VIGILS HERE LAST

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
NIGHT REALLY MOVING VIGILS.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
20 CHILDREN AND 6 ADULTS DIED IN

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
FRIDAY'S SHOOTING INSIDE SANDY

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY.

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
WE SHOULD BEGIN HEARING THE

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
FIRST FUNERAL PLANS FOR SOME OF

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
THE VICTIMS VERY SOON.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
WE ALSO WANT TO PASS THIS ALONG.

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
THE UNITED WAY HAS SET UP A

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
SANDY HOOK SCHOOL FUND.

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
DONATIONS, AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
THERE ON YOUR SCREEN, DONATIONS

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
SENT TO THE NEWTOWN SAVINGS BANK

NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
THIS FUND WILL BE USED TO HELP

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
PAY FOR THE FUNERALS OF THE

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
VICTIMS, JOHN.

62
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
>>> POLICE SAY THEY HAVE FOUND

63
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
IMPORTANT EVIDENCE DURING THEIR

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
SEARCHES AT THE SCHOOL AND AT

65
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THE SHOOTER'S HOME.

66
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
WE ALSO KNOW NOW MORE ABOUT THE

67
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
ACTUAL SHOOTING AND WHAT WEAPONS

68
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
WERE USED IN IT.

69
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT SUSAN

70
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
CANDIOTTI JOINS ME NOW AND,

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
SUSAN, WHAT ARE WE LEARNING THIS

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
MORNING?

73
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
>> HI, JOHN.

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
WELL, WE KNOW ONE THING AND THAT

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
IS THAT FEDERAL AGENTS AND OTHER

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
INVESTIGATORS WHO WILL BE BACK

77
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
OUT POUNDING OUT THE STREETS

78
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
TODAY, CHASING DOWN LEADS,

79
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
INFORMATION THEY HAVE THAT THE

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
SUSPECTED SHOOTER IN THIS CASE

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
MAY HAVE VISITED GUN STORES OR

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
GUN RANGES IN THE DAYS BEFORE

83
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
THE ATTACK.

84
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
HOWEVER, SO FAR OUR SOURCES TELL

85
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
US THAT THOSE TIPS HAVE NOT

86
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
PANNED OUT.

87
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THREE

88
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
ADDITIONAL GUNS HAVE BEEN FOUND,

89
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES, AT THE

90
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
HOME THAT THE SHOOTER SHARED

91
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
WITH HIS MOTHER.
WE'RE STANDING DOWN THE STREET

92
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
FROM THAT HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
WE ARE TOLD THAT ONE OF THOSE

94
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
THREE WEAPONS, WHICH ARE ALL

95
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
DESCRIBED TO ME AS OLDER MODEL

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
RIFLES, AT LEAST ONE OF THEM

97
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
HAVE BEEN TRACED TO THE MOTHER.

98
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
THEY'RE STILL CONDUCTING

99
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
ADDITIONAL TRACES.

100
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
AND WE ALSO KNOW ABOUT THOSE

101
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
THREE GUNS THAT WERE FOUND AT

102
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
THE CRIME SCENE.

103
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
TWO HANDGUNS AND A LONG GUN,

104
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
KNOWN AS A BUSHMASTER, THAT'S A

105
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE.
AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT

106
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
INVESTIGATORS KNOW HE USED ONE

107
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
OF THOSE GUNS.

108
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
IDENTIFIED WHICH ONE HE USED TO

109
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
KILL HIMSELF, BUT THEY'RE NOT

110
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
REVEALING WHICH ONE THAT IS.

111
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THE LONG GUN IS THE ONE THE

112
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER SAID WAS USED

113
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
TO KILL SEVERAL VICTIMS WITH

114
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS.

115
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
>> ALL THE WOUNDS THAT I KNOW OF

116
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
AT THIS POINT WERE CAUSED BY THE

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
LONG WEAPON.

118
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
>> THE RIFLE WAS THE PRIMARY

119
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
WEAPON?
>> YES.

120
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I BELIEVE EVERYBODY WAS HIT MORE

121
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
THAN ONCE.

122
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
EVERYBODY'S DEATH WAS CAUSED BY,

123
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
EVERYONE THAT WE HAVE COMPLETED

124
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
SO FAR WAS CAUSED BY GUNSHOT

125
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
WOUNDS.
AND, OBVIOUSLY, THE MANNER OF

126
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
DEATH ON ALL THESE CASES HAS

127
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
BEEN CLASSIFIED AS HOMICIDE.

128
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
>> CERTAINLY FROM THAT

129
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
DESCRIPTION, IT'S HARD TO

130
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
UNDERSTAND, JOHN.

131
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'M SURE YOU'D AGREE WHAT THAT

132
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
SCENE MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE AND

133
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
WHY WAS EACH VICTIM SHOT

134
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
MULTIPLE TIMES.

135
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
PERHAPS WE'LL GET SOME ANSWERS

136
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
ONE DAY.

137
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
>> I SIMPLY CANNOT IMAGINE THAT

138
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
SCENE.
INVESTIGATORS, OBVIOUSLY,

139
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
FOLLOWING SO MANY LEADS NOW.

140
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
THEY WERE TALKING TO ADAM

141
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
LANZA'S FATHER AND ALSO HIS

142
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
BROTHER, I WAS IN HOBOKEN, NEW

143
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
JERSEY, FRIDAY NIGHT BECAUSE

144
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
POLICE HAD TAKEN IN HIS BROTHER,

145
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
RYAN LANZA, FOR QUESTIONING.

146
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
THAT WAS A CURIOUS THING AS IT

147
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
WAS HAPPENING.

148
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
WHAT ARE WE HEARING AT THIS

149
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
POINT FROM THEM?
DO WE KNOW?

150
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
>> THE OLDER BROTHER HAS NOT

151
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
ISSUED A STATEMENT ON HIS OWN AS

152
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
OF YET.

153
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
WE KNOW HE WAS QUESTIONED, AS

154
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
YOU SAID.
THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW, ACCORDING

155
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
TO OUR SOURCES.
THAT HE TOLD INVESTIGATORS THAT

156
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
HIS YOUNGER BROTHER HAD AUTISM.

157
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
THAT'S ALL WE KNOW.

158
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
BUT CERTAINLY, THAT'S NOT AN

159
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
EXPLANATION.
NO ONE IS SAYING THAT IT IS OR

160
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
EVEN PROVIDING ANY KIND OF A

161
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
MOTIVE OR CONNECTION TO WHAT

162
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
HAPPENED HERE.

163
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
OF COURSE, AUTHORITIES ARE

164
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
LOOKING AT EVERYTHING AS THEY

165
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
LOOK AT PROFILES.

166
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
BUT WE ALSO, AS YOU INDICATED,

167
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
HAVE HEARD NOW, WE GOT A

168
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
STATEMENT LAST NIGHT FROM THE

169
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
SUSPECT'S FATHER AND HE ISSUED

170
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
THIS STATEMENT WHICH READS IN

171
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
PART, "OUR FAMILY IS GRIEVING

172
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
ALONG WITH ALL THOSE WHO HAVE

173
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS ENORMOUS

174
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
TRAGEDY.

175
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
WE ARE IN A STATE OF DISBELIEF

176
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
AND TRYING TO FIND WHATEVER

177
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
ANSWERS WE CAN.

178
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
WE, TOO, ARE ASKING WHY."

179
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
THOSE ANSWERS SEEM TO BE, JOHN,

180
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
IN SHORT SUPPLY.

181
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000

ACTION TO PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES

562
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
LIKE THIS, REGARDLESS OF THE

563
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
POLITICS.

564
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
>> Reporter: WHAT EXACTLY DOES
HE MEAN BY MEANINGFUL ACTION?

565
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
CRITICS OF THE PRESIDENT'S

NEW YORK MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG

569
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
SAID CALLING FOR MEANINGFUL

570
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
ACTION IS NOT ENOUGH.

571
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
WE NEED IMMEDIATE ACT ACTION.

572
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
WE HEARD ALL THE RHETORIC

573
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
BEFORE.
WHAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN IS

574
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
LEADERSHIP.
NOT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND NOT

575
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
FROM CONGRESS.

576
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
GUN VIOLENCE HAS NOT BEEN A

577
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
PRIORITY FOR THE OBAMA

578
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
ADMINISTRATION.
AS HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2008,

579
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
HE SUPPORTED RUNNING A BAN ON

580
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS.
>> KEEPING AK 47s OUT OF THE

581
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
HANDS OF CRIMINALS.

582

583
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
DID NOT MAKE GOOD ON HIS

584
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
CAMPAIGN PLEDGE.
THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT

585
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
GUN VIOLENCE GAVE THE PRESIDENT

586
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
ACROSS THE BOARD Fs ON ITS

00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000

APPETITE TO TOUCH THE

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE.

595
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
MULTIPLE GUN CONTROL BILLS HAVE

596
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
BEEN INTRODUCED, NOT A SINGLE

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
ONE HAS MADE IT TO THE FLOOR FOR

598
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
A VOTE.

599
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
THOSE INVOLVED IN THE DEBATE

600
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000

PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

607
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE

608
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
DISQUALIFIED FROM PURCHASING

609
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
ACCUSTOMED TO DAILY REPORTS OF

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000

HIMSELF.

618
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
EARLY SATURDAY MORNING IN

ISLAND TRAIN IN 1993 SAID THE

627
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
CONNECTICUT SHOOTING MAY BE WHAT

628
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
FORCES PRESIDENT OBAMA AND

629
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
CONGRESS TO FINALLY ADDRESS THE

630
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
PROBLEM.
>> LET'S FACE IT, WE NEED TO

631
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
HAVE THE PRESIDENT AS THE BULLY

632
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
PULPIT ON TRYING TO GET

633
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
SOMETHING DONE.

634
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
THIS TIME WHAT I SAW WAS

635
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
DIFFERENT THAT POLITICIANS THAT

636
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
USUALLY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT WERE

637
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
TALKING ABOUT IT.

638
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
SO, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THIS

639
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
TIME AROUND.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE MAYBE THE

640
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
PENDULUM IS TURNING AND THE

641
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
COUNTRY IS READY TO GET SERIOUS

642
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

643
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
>> JAY CARNEY SAID FRIDAY IT IS

644
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
THE TIME TO EXPRESS SYMPATHY FOR

645
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
VICTIMS' FAMILIES, NOT THE TIME

646
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
TO ENGAGE IN A POLICY DEBATE.

647
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
BUT I SPOKE WITH CONGRESSWOMAN

648
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
McCARTHY AND SHE SAID SHE CALLED

649
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
UP THE WHITE HOUSE AND SAID,

650
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

651
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE

652
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
BEEN DISCUSSING FOR YEARS.

653
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN, THE WHITE

654
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
HOUSE.

655
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
[ HEART BEATING,
MONITOR BEEPING ]

656
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Woman: WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE

657
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
DOESN'T COVER FLOODS?

658
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
[ HEART RATE INCREASES ]

659
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Man: A FEW INCHES OF WATER
CAUSED ALL THIS?

660
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
[ HEART RATE INCREASES ]

661
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Woman #2: BUT I DON'T EVEN LIVE
NEAR THE WATER.

662
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT FLOOD
INSURANCE MAY SHOCK YOU --

663
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
INCLUDING THE FACT
THAT A PREFERRED RISK POLICY

664
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
STARTS AS LOW AS $129 A YEAR.

665
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
FOR AN AGENT, CALL THE NUMBER

666
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
THAT APPEARS ON YOUR SCREEN.

667
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That was ME...

668
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
the day I learned I had
to start insulin

669
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
for my type 2 diabetes.

670
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
ME...

671
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
thinking my only option was the
vial and syringe dad used.

672
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And ME...

673
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
discovering once-daily
Levemir® FlexPen.

674
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
FlexPen® is prefilled.

675
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Doesn't need
refrigeration

676
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
for up to
42 days.

677
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
No drawing from a vial.

678
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Dial the exact dose.

679
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Inject by pushing a button.

680
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
FlexPen® is insulin delivery...

681
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
MY way.

682
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Levemir® (insulin detemir
[rDNA origin] injection)

683
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
is a long-acting insulin

684
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
used to control high blood sugar
in adults and children

685
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
with diabetes and is not
recommended to treat

686
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
diabetic ketoacidosis.

687
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Do not use Levemir® if
you are allergic

688
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
to any of its ingredients.

689
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
The most common side effect
is low blood sugar,

690
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
which may cause
symptoms such as sweating,

691
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
shakiness, confusion,
and headache.

692
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Severe low blood sugar can be
serious and life threatening.

693
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Ask your healthcare provider
about alcohol use,

694
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
operating machinery, or driving.

695
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Other possible side
effects include

696
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
injection site reactions.

697
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Tell your healthcare provider
about all medicines you take

698
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and all of your
medical conditions.

699
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Get medical help right away
if you experience

700
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
serious allergic
reactions, such as body rash,

701
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
trouble with breathing, fast
heartbeat, or sweating.

702
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
With FlexPen®... say good night
to vial and syringe.

703
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Ask your doctor about
Levemir® FlexPen.
