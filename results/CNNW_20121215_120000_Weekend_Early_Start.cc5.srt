SO CNN NEWSROOM.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
ONE OF THE SIX ADULTS VICTIM OF

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
THE SHOOTING IN NEWTOWN,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
CONNECTICUT, PARENT TOLD US THEY

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
WERE IN A MEETING YESTERDAY WITH

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
THE PRINCIPAL AND VICE PRINCIPAL

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
ALONG WITH MARY SHERLOCK WHEN

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
THEY HEARD THE LOUD POP, POP,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
POP, THEY WENT TO CHECK THAT OUT

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
IN THE HALLWAY.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
SHERLOCK AND THE PRINCIPAL

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
DIDN'T RETURN ALIVE.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
JUST A VERY SOLEMN OUTCOME TO

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
THAT.
SHERLOCK WAS PART OF A TEAM THAT

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
WAS REALLY RELIED UPON THERE AT

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
SHE WAS PART OF THE SCHOOL'S

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
CRISIS INTERVENTION TEAM, ALI.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
SO EVEN IN A TIME LIKE THIS WHEN

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
PEOPLE ARE TURNING TO THOSE FOR

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000

I'M IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT,

ME.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
A BLOCK AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
THE HORRIBLE MASSACRE.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW.

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
WE'VE LEARNED THE NAMES OF TWO

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
OF THE ADULTS, THE PRINCIPAL AND

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
A SCHOOL COUNSELOR, BUT NOT THE

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
NAMES OF THE CHILDREN.
NOW, THAT IS EXPECTED TO START

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
HAPPENING AT AROUND 8:00 A.M.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
RIGHT WHERE I AM.

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
RIGHT NOW THE BODIES ARE STILL

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
POLICE SAY IT'S AN ACTIVE CRIME

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
POLICE SAY 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM

60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000

FLAGS FLYING AT HALF STAFF HERE

63
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY TO HONOR

64
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
THOSE LOST AT THE ELEMENTARY

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING HERE IN NEWTOWN,

66
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

67
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
SCHOOL.
PRESIDENT OBAMA OFFERED HIS OWN

68
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
THOUGHTS THIS MORNING IN HIS

69
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
WEEKLY ADDRESS.

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
THOUGHTS ON THE TRAGEDY, AND

71
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
THOUGHTS ON GUNS.

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
>> ON FRIDAY, WE LEARNED THAT

73
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
MORE THAN TWO DOZEN PEOPLE WERE

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
KILLED WHEN A GUNMAN OPENED FIRE

75
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
IN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
MOST OF THOSE WHO DIED WERE JUST

78
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
YOUNG CHILDREN WITH THEIR WHOLE

79
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
LIVES AHEAD OF THEM.

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
AND EVERY PARENT IN AMERICA HAS

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
A HEART HEAVY WITH HURT.

82
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
AMONG THE FALLEN WERE ALSO

83
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
TEACHERS, MEN AND WOMEN WHO

84
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO HELPING

85
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
OUR CHILDREN FULFILL THEIR

86
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
DREAMS.
SO OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN TODAY.

87
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
WE GRIEVE FOR THE FAMILIES OF

88
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THOSE WE LOST.

89
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
AND WE KEEP IN OUR PRAYERS THE

90
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
PARENTS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVED.

91
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
BECAUSE AS BLESSED AS THEY ARE

92
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOME,

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
THEY KNOW THAT THEIR CHILD'S

94
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
INNOCENCE HAS BEEN TORN AWAY FAR
TOO EARLY.

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
AS A NATION, WE HAVE ENDURED FAR

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
TOO MANY OF THESE TRAGEDIES IN

97
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
THE LAST FEW YEARS.

98
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN,

99
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
A SHOPPING MALL IN OREGON, A

100
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
HOUSE OF WORSHIP IN WISCONSIN, A

101
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
MOVIE THEATER IN COLORADO,

102
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
COUNTLESS STREET CORNERS IN

103
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
PLACES LIKE CHICAGO AND

104
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
PHILADELPHIA.
ANY OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS COULD

105
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
BE OUR OWN.

106
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
SO WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER, AND

107
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE

108
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
MEANINGFUL ACTION TO PREVENT
MORE TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS FROM

109
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
HAPPENING.

110
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
REGARDLESS OF POLITICS.

111
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
THIS WEEKEND, MICHELLE AND I ARE

112
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
DOING WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT

113
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
IS DOING, HOLDING OUR CHILDREN

114
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
AS CLOSE AS WE CAN AND REMINDING

115
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
THEM HOW MUCH WE LOVE THEM.

116
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

117
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CAN'T DO THAT

118
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
TODAY.

119
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
AND THEY NEED ALL OF US RIGHT
NOW.

120
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
BECAUSE WHILE NOTHING CAN TAKE

121
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
THE PLACE OF A LOST CHILD OR

122
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
LOVED ONE, ALL OF US CAN EXTEND

123
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
A HAND TO THOSE OF US IN NEED.

124
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
TO REMIND THEM WE'RE THERE FOR

125
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
THEM, THAT WE'RE PRAYING FOR

126
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THEM.
AND THAT THE LOVE THEY FELT FOR

127
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
THOSE THEY LOST ENDURES NOT JUST

128
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
IN THEIR OWN MEMORIES BUT ALSO

129
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND IN

130
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THEIR COUNTRY.

131
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.

132
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
>> WE ARE LEARNING CHILLING

133
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
DETAILS OF WHAT HAPPENED WHEN

134
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
THE GUNMAN BURST INTO SANDY HOOK

135
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

136
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
SOME OF THOSE DETAILS ARE COMING

137
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
FROM YOUNG SURVIVORS.
CHILDREN WHO WERE IN THAT SCHOOL

138
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
DURING THE RAMPAGE AND WHO WERE

139
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
ABLE TO ESCAPE.

140
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
HERE'S CNN'S BRIAN TODD.

141
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
>> Reporter: THE ACCOUNT OF A

142
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
YOUNG BOY SAID TO BE DELIVERING

143
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
AN ATTENDANCE REPORT TO THE

144
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
OFFICE AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

145
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
SCHOOL WHEN THE SHOOTINGS TOOK

146
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
PLACE IS SURREAL.

147
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
>> I SAW SOME OF THE BULLETS

148
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
GOING PAST THE HALL THAT I WAS

149
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
RIGHT NEXT TO.

150
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
AND THEN A TEACHER PULLED ME

151
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
INTO HER CLASSROOM.

152
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
>> HE SAID HE HEARD A SOUND LIKE

153
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
SOMEONE KICKING A DOOR.

154
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
HIS MOTHER CLINGING TO HIM HAD

155
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
WORDS OF THANKS.

156
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
>> I'M SO GRATEFUL TO THE

157
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
TEACHER WHO SAVED HIM.

158
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
>> YOU THINK THE TEACHER SAVED

159
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
HIS LIFE?

160
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
>> SHE DEFINITELY DID.

161
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
HE HAD BULLETS GOING BY HIM AND

162
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
SHE GRABBED HIM AND ANOTHER

163
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
CHILD AND PULLED HIM INTO A

164
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
CLASSROOM.
>> BRENDAN MURRAY, A FOURTH

165
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
GRADER DESCRIBED THE CHAOS.

166
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
>> I WAS IN THE GYM AT THE TIME

167
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
AND SO, THE TEACHERS, WE HEARD

168
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
LOTS OF BANGS AND WE THOUGHT

169
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
THAT IT WAS THE CUSTODIAN

170
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
KNOCKING STUFF DOWN.

171
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
WE HEARD SCREAMING.

172
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
AND SO, WE -- WE WENT TO THE

173
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
WALL AND WE SAT DOWN.

174
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
AND THEN POLICE CAME IN.

175
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
AND IT WAS LIKE, IS HE IN HERE

176
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
AND RAN OUT.

177
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
AND WHEN SOMEBODY YELLED GET TO

178
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
A SAFE PLACE.
SO WE WENT TO THE CLOSET IN THE

179
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
GYM AND SAT THERE FOR A LITTLE

180
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
WHILE.

181
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
AND THEN THE POLICE WERE

182
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
KNOCKING ON THE DOOR AND WERE

183
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
LIKE, WE'RE EVACUATING PEOPLE.

184
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
WE'RE EVACUATING PEOPLE.

185
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
>> CNN IS ONLY AIRING SOUND OF

186
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS GAVE

187
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
PERMISSION.

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
AS ONE WOMAN WALKED AWAY FROM

189
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
THE SCHOOL SHE WAS HEARD CRYING

190
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
WHY, WHY.

191
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
A POLICEMAN WAS HEARD SAYING IT

192
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
WAS THE WORST THING HE'D SEEN IN

193
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
HIS CAREER.

194
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
A NURSE FROM NEARBY DANBURY

195
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
HOSPITAL DESCRIBED THE SCENE

196
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
THERE AS PARENTS WAITED FOR WORD

197
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN.
>> PARENTS, ALL THESE PARENTS

198
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
WERE WAITING FOR THEIR CHILDREN

199
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
TO COME OUT.

200
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE, YOU

201
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
KNOW, STILL ALIVE.

202
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
AND THERE'S 20 PARENTS THAT WERE

203
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
JUST TOLD THAT THEIR CHILDREN

204
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
ARE DEAD.

205
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
IT WAS AWFUL.

206
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
>> THE FATHER OF A YOUNG GIRL

207
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
WHO SURVIVED WAS JUST TRYING TO

208
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
PROCESS IT ALL.

209
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
>> IT WAS SHOCKING.
I GOT THE CALL AT WORK THIS

210
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
MORNING AND -- I CAN'T BELIEVE A

211
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
SMALL TOWN LIKE THIS WOULD EVER

212
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN.

213
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
AND TO BE IN AN ELEMENTARY

214
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
SCHOOL, IT'S UNHEARD OF.

215
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
>> BY LATE FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND

216
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
INTO THE EVENING, EVACUATED

217
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
CHILDREN WERE BEING CARED FOR

218
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
AND REUNITING WITH THEIR PARENTS

219
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
AT A NEARBY FIRE HOUSE.

220
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
BRIAN TODD, CNN, WASHINGTON.

221
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
>> WE'RE ALSO GETTING A LOT OF

222
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW YOU CAN HELP

223
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THOSE AFFECTED.

224
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
IF YOU WANT TO HELP, GO TO

225
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
CNN.COM/IMPACT.

226
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
JOHN?
>> THANKS SO MUCH, ALI.

227
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
AS EVERYONE KNOWS, OUR FOCUS AS

228
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
MUCH AS IT CAN BE IS ON VICTIMS.

229
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION GOING

230
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
ON RIGHT NOW.

231
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS.

232
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
AND WE'RE LEARNING MORE NOW

233
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
ABOUT THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER IN

234
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
THIS CASE.

235
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
POLICE SAY HIS NAME IS ADAM

236
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
LANZA.

237
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
CNN'S MARY SNOW IS AT LANZA'S

238
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
HOME.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE

239
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
SUSPECTED SHOOTER?

240
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
>> Reporter: JOHN, IT'S BELIEVED

241
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
THAT HE LIVED WITH HIS MOTHER AT

242
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THE HOME THAT IS BEHIND ME NOW

243
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
BLOCKED OFF BY POLICE.

244
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
AND IN TERMS OF DESCRIPTIONS OF

245
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
HIM, ONE NEIGHBOR DESCRIBED HIM

246
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
AS TROUBLED.

247
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
FORMER CLASSMATES DESCRIBED HIM

248
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
AS VERY BRIGHT, SOMEONE WHO KEPT

249
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
TO HIMSELF SOCIALLY AWKWARD, AND

250
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
WE'RE ALSO LEARNING FROM OUR --

251
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
CNN'S SUSAN CANDIOTTI THAT A LAW

252
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL TOLD HER

253
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
THAT A FAMILY MEMBER OF LANZA

254
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
TOLD INVESTIGATORS THAT HE HAD A

255
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
FORM OF AUTISM.

256
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
>> MARY, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT

257
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
THE GUNS?

258
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
THE WEAPONS THAT HE USED IN THE

259
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
SHOOTING?

260
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
WE UNDERSTAND THERE WERE TWO

261
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
PISTOLS, ALSO A RIFLE PERHAPS

262
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
FOUND IN THE CAR.

263
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
>> Reporter: AND LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIALS SO FAR ARE SAYING WHAT

264
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
CNN HAS LEARNED IS THEY WERE

265
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
LEGALLY PURCHASED BY HIS MOTHER

266
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
NANCY LANZA.

267
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
>> ALL RIGHT.
MARY SNOW, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

268
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
WE'LL BE CHECKING IN WITH YOU
ALL MORNING.

269
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
ALI?

270
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
>> YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

271
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
GUNS, JOHN, LET'S FOCUS IN ON

272
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
THE WEAPONS USED ON THE ATTACK.

273
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
OUR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT SUSAN

274
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
CANDIOTTI HAS THAT PART OF OUR

275
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
COVERAGE.
SUSAN?

276
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
>> WE'RE TRYING TO GET DOWN TO

277
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
THE BOTTOM A BIT MORE ABOUT THIS

278
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
MAN, THIS SHOOTER, ADAM LANZA,

279
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
20 YEARS OLD, WE KNOW ACCORDING

280
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
TO OUR SOURCES THAT WHEN HE CAME

281
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
TO THAT SCHOOL HE WAS ARMED WITH

282
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
THREE GUNS.

283
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
HE WAS WEARING WHAT IS DESCRIBED

284
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
TO ME AS BLACK BATTLE FATIGUES

285
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
AND A MILITARY VEST.

286
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
NOW, WHERE DID HE GET THESE

287
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
THREE GUNS?

288
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
AND WHAT KIND WERE THEY?

289
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
THE THREE GUNS WERE TWO

290
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
HANDGUNS, A GLOCK, AND A SIG

291
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
SAUER AS WELL AS A .223 BUSH

292
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
MASTER.
THIS IS A SEMIAUTOMATIC GUN.

293
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
WE'VE GOT PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE

294
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
TYPE OF WEAPON IT IS.

295
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
WE UNDERSTAND FROM OUR SOURCES

296
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
THAT THESE GUNS WERE ALL

297
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
REGISTERED BELONGED TO HIS

298
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
MOTHER, HIS MOTHER WHO WAS ALSO

299
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
KILLED.

300
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
NOW, THE MOTHER'S BODY WAS FOUND

301
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
IN THE HOUSE WHERE A FAMILY HOME

302
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
HERE IN THIS AREA.

303
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
WE DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT --

304
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
ABOUT ADAM LANZA.

305
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
WE DO KNOW THAT HIS BROTHER RYAN

306
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
WHO WAS A BIT OLDER, 24 YEARS

307
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
OLD, HE WAS TAKEN IN TO CUSTODY

308
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
FOR QUESTIONING.

309
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
HE IS NOT BEING CALLED A

310
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
SUSPECT, BUT HE WAS IN HOBOKEN,

311
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
NEW JERSEY, WHEN THEY BROUGHT

312
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
HIM IN FOR QUESTIONING.

313
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
THAT'S WHERE HE LIVES TO TRY TO

314
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
FIND OUT WHAT IF ANYTHING HE

315
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
KNEW ABOUT THIS.

316
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
WHAT HE COULD TELL THEM ABOUT

317
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
HIS BROTHER.

318
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
WHAT INFORMATION THEY -- HE CAN

319
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
GIVE ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND.

320
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
AND POLICE ALSO QUESTIONED THEIR

321
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
FATHER.
HE STILL LIVES IN THIS AREA.

322
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
HE IS DIVORCED FROM HIS WIFE WHO

323
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS HERE, AND

324
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
HE HAS REMARRIED.

325
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
SO HE TOO IS BEING QUESTIONED BY

326
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
POLICE TO TRY TO SHED SOME LIGHT

327
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
ON ADAM LANZA AND WHY THIS

328
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
TRAGEDY HAPPENED.

329
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
>> THANKS FOR THAT.

330
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
A LOT OF QUESTIONS ARE FORMING

331
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
AROUND THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER

332
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
NANCY LANZA, THE REGISTERED

333
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
OWNER OF THE THREE WEAPONS AS

334
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
SUSAN TOLD US.

335
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
GUNS SIMILAR TO THESE AS WE'RE

336
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
SHOWING YOU NOW, A GLOCK

337
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
REVOLVER, A GLOCK PISTOL, A SIG

338
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
SAUER AND A RIFLE.

339
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'M JOINED BY A CNN CONTRIBUTOR.

340
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS

341
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
ABOUT THE ASSAULT RIFLE FIRST.

342
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
THIS WAS LEGALLY PURCHASED BY

343
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
NANCY LANZA, WHY WOULD SHE NEED

344
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
A SEMIAUTOMATIC?

345
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
AND WHAT THE LAWS ARE AROUND
ACQUIRING ONE?

346
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
>> WELL, THE LAWS ARE THAT YOU

347
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
COULD ACQUIRE IT.

348
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
THERE HAD BEEN A BAN IN PLACE

349
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
THAT MICHIGAN DURING THE CLINTON

350
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
ADMINISTRATION.
BUT IT WAS ALLOWED TO EXPIRE AND

351
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
IT'S NOT BEEN RENEWED.

352
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
ANYONE THAT CAN BUY A PISTOL CAN

353
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
BUY ONE OF THESE WEAPONS.

354
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
THAT BUSH MASTER .223, THAT'S

355
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
THE SAME CALIBER OUR MILITARY

356
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
CARRIED IN VIETNAM AND SINCE

357
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
IT'S USED IN THE M-16 AND M-4

358
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
AUTOMATIC RIFLES.
IN THIS CASE, YOU WOULD HAVE TO

359
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
KEEP PULLING THE TRIGGER, BUT

360
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
YOU CAN FIRE AS MANY BULLETS AS

361
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
QUICKLY AS YOU CAN PULL THE

362
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
TRIGGER WITH THAT GUN AND THE
TWO HANDGUNS.

363
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
>> AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR

364
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
VIEWERS, WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR

365
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
WITH GUNS.

366
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
THE TERM SEMIAUTOMATIC MEANS YOU

367
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
KEEP PULLING THE TRIGGER, YOU

368
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
DON'T HOLD IT DOWN ONCE, BUT YOU

369
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
DON'T HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO

370
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
SHOOT AGAIN.

371
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
AND IN THE CASE OF A

372
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC PISTOL, THE

373
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
BULLETS ARE FED IN THROUGH A

374
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
MAGAZINE AND THEY CAN RANGE IN

375
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
SIZE FROM SEVEN OR EIGHT ROUNDS

376
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
TO 15 ROUNDS.

377
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
THE TWO GUNS YOU'VE BEEN SHOWING

378
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
PICTURES OF WOULD APPEAR TO BE

379
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
THE 15-ROUND STANDARD SIZED

380
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
MAGAZINES FOR THOSE GUNS.

381
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
BUT YOU CAN BUY EXTENDED

382
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
MAGAZINES AS WAS SEEN IN OTHER

383
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
SHOOTINGS IN THE PAST THAT CAN

384
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
GO 30 ROUNDS OR EVEN MORE.

385
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
AND, AGAIN, IT'S AS QUICKLY AS

386
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
YOU CAN PULL THE TRIGGER.

387
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
AS OPPOSED TO THE REVOLVER WHICH

388
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
IS ONLY GOING TO HOLD SIX ROUNDS

389
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
AND YOU HAVE TO STOP AND REFEED

390
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
MANUALLY EACH OF THE BULLETS

391
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
INTO THE CHAMBER, CLOSE IT UP

392
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
AND BEGIN SHOOTING AGAIN.

393
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
WITH A SEMIAUTOMATIC, YOU FIRE

394
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
AS FAST AS YOU CAN GO, DROP THAT

395
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
MAGAZINE, PUT A NEW ONE IN AND

396
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
KEEP ON GOING.

397
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
AND, AGAIN, IF HE HAD TO STOP

398
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
AND RELOAD SEVERAL TIMES, HE'S

399
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE JUMPED

400
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
ON BY 5-YEAR-OLDS WHILE HE'S IN

401
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
THE RE-LOADING PROCESS.

402
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
AND, OF COURSE, THE TEACHERS ARE

403
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO SAVE

404
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
THE CHILDREN AND HUDDLE THEM.

405
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
SO HE'S GOING TO HAVE NO

406
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
OPPOSITION PHYSICALLY BY ANY OF

407
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
THE VICTIMS WHILE HE'S SHOOTING,

408
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
WHILE HE'S RELOADING AND THEN
RESHOOTING.

409
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
>> TOM, THERE ARE MANY REASONS
WHY AN OWNER WOULD CHOOSE A

410
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
PISTOL OVER A REVOLVER, BUT ONE

411
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THE PISTOL,

412
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THAT IS

413
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
IN ORDER TO RELOAD, YOU CAN

414
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
RELOAD AS YOU SAID IN THESE

415
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
CASES POSSIBLY 15 ROUNDS VERY

416
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
INSTANTLY.

417
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
YOU PRESS A BUTTON, THE MAGAZINE

418
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
DROPS OUT AND YOU PUT ANOTHER

419
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
LOADED MAGAZINE IN.

420
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
YOU CAN SHOOT A MUCH MORE RAPID

421
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
PACE OF FIRE WITH A

422
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC PISTOL THAN YOU

423
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
CAN A REVOLVER.

424
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
AND ESPECIALLY THE QUALITY

425
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
PISTOLS LIKE A GLOCK OR SIG

426
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
SAUER HAVE BECOME THE CHOICE OF

427
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE OF THAT

428
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
REASON.

429
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
THEY'RE HIGH QUALITY AND ALLOW A

430
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
RAPID RATE OF FIRE WHILE IN USE.

431
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
>> DOES IT STRIKE YOU AS UNUSUAL

432
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
THAT SOMEBODY WOULD BE OWNING

433
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
THESE THREE WEAPONS?

434
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
OR IS THIS NORMAL FOR SOMEBODY

435
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
WHO WOULD OWN GUNS?

436
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
>> I WOULDN'T CALL IT NORMAL,

437
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S ESTIMATED

438
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
THERE'S 285 MILLION GUNS AT

439
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
LARGE IN THIS COUNTRY WITH A

440
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
POPULATION OF A LITTLE OVER 300

441
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
MILLION.

442
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
SO THERE'S A LOT OF GUNS,

443
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
HANDGUNS, ASSAULT RIFLES, A

444
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
VARIETY OF WEAPONS THAT ARE OUT

445
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
THERE, AND ARE PERFECTLY LEGAL

446
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
TO ACQUIRE AS WE'VE SEEN.

447
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
AND IN THIS CASE, IF THE MOTHER

448
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
ACQUIRED THE WEAPONS, AND

449
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
ACQUIRED THEM LEGALLY, THEN YOU

450
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
DON'T HAVE THE SITUATION OF

451
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
MENTALLY DISTURBED CHILD GOING

452
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
THROUGH THE TESTING OR GOING

453
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
THROUGH ANY KIND OF BACKGROUND

454
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
CHECK TO GET THE WEAPON.

455
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
HE JUST TAKES HER WEAPONS AND

456
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
USES THEM AGAINST HER AND THE

457
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
OTHER VICTIMS IN THIS CASE.

458
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
>> AND CONNECTICUT DOES HAVE

459
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
SOME OF THE STRICTER GUN LAWS IN

460
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
THIS COUNTRY.

461
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000

MORNING.

464
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000

I PUT AWAY MONEY.

THE ATTACK ON AN ELEMENTARY

503
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
SCHOOL.
IT'S JUST BEHIND ME OVER THAT

504
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000

WAS A FIXTURE THERE IN THE

553
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
EDUCATION DEPARTMENT.

554
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE REMEMBER HER AS

555
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
BEING THE PERSON THEY WOULD GO

556
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
TO DURING CRISIS SITUATIONS.

557
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
SO, YOU KNOW, SHE'S NOT AROUND

558
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
NOW.

559
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
THE PERSON THAT PEOPLE WOULD

560
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
TURN TO IN A SITUATION LIKE

561
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
THIS.
WE'RE HEARING SHE WAS IN A

562
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000

563
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
PRINCIPAL AND VICE PRINCIPAL

564
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
ALONG WITH ANOTHER PARENT WHO

565
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
SPOKE TO CNN YESTERDAY ON

FRIDAY, THEY TOLD US THEY HEARD

567
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
THE LOUD POP, POP, POPS COMING

568
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
FROM THE GUN IN THE HALLWAY.

569
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
THEY WENT TO INVESTIGATE AND

570
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

571
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
NOISE WAS, SHERLOCK AND THE

572
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
PRINCIPAL PERISHED, THEY DIDN'T

573
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
COME BACK ALIVE.

574
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
ALI, WE KNOW THAT MARY SHERLOCK,

575
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
56 YEARS OLD WAS AN EXPERT IN

576
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
PSYCHOLOGY WITH A MASTERS FROM

577
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
SOUTHERN CONNECTICUT STATE
UNIVERSITY.

578
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
SHE ALSO WORKED IN THE COMMUNITY

579
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
AT A GROUP HOME FOR DISABLED

580
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
ADULTS.
AND AS I MENTIONED, SHE WAS PART

581
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
OF THAT SCHOOL'S CRISIS

582
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
INTERVENTION TEAM.

583
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
SHERLOCK WAS ALSO A FAMILY WOMAN

584
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
MARRIED FOR 31 YEARS, ALI, SHE

585
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
LEAVES BEHIND HER HUSBAND BILL

586
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
ALONG WITH TWO DAUGHTERS, BOTH

587
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
IN THEIR 20s.

588
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
SHE LISTS AMONG HER ACTIVITIES

589
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
THAT SHE LIKED HER HOBBIES, SHE

590
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
LIKED TO GARDEN, SPEND TIME AT

591
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
THE LAKE AND GO TO THE THEATER.

592
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO ANY OF

593
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
THAT ANYMORE.

594
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
ALI?
>> 26 PEOPLE KILLED, MANY MORE

595
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000

599
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000

JOHN?
>> GOOD MORNING, ALI, I'M

612
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
STANDING IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH

613
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
WHERE LAST NIGHT THERE WAS A

614
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
VIGIL.
MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE GATHERED

615
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
HERE WHERE I AM TO GRIEVE

616
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
TOGETHER, TO BE TOGETHER, TO

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
MOURN THOSE LOST.
SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE HERE,

618
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
THOUGH, ASKING QUESTIONS, NOT

619
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
JUST QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT

620
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
HAPPENED AND WHY, BUT WHAT TO DO

621
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
NEXT.

622
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
PARENTS, TEACHERS, AN ENTIRE

623
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
NATION RIGHT NOW STILL

624
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
STRUGGLING TO GRASP HOW A GUNMAN

625
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
COULD TAKE SO MANY INNOCENT

626
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
LIVES AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

627
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

628
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
SO HOW DO YOU TALK TO YOUR

629
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
CHILD?
YOUR CHILD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

630
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
OUR LISA SYLVESTER SPOKE TO SOME

631
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
EXPERTS.
>> Reporter: IF THERE'S AN IMAGE

632
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
THAT SUMS UP THIS STORY, IT IS

633
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
THIS.

634
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
ANY PARENT OUT THERE CAN RELATE.

635
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
PSYCHIATRIST CHARLES RAZEN WITH

636
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA'S

637
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
COLLEGE OF MEDICINE.

638
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
>> HOW DO YOU WRAP YOUR MIND

639
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
AROUND SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

640
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
WITH A GOOD DEAL OF HEART BREAK

641
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
AND WITH THE UNDERSTANDING IT'S

642
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
GOING TO TAKE A WHILE AND THAT

643
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
THERE WILL BE PEOPLE CLOSELY

644
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
IMPACTED BY THIS WHO WILL NEVER

645
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
WRAP THEIR MINDS AROUND THIS.

646
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
HUMAN MINDS ARE NOT INFINITE.

647
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
AND THIS IS -- THIS IS NOW

648
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
APPEARING TO BE PROBABLY THE

649
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
WORST SCHOOLYARD CATASTROPHE IN

650
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
HISTORY.
AND SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A

651
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
HUGE LONG-TERM FALLOUT FOR THIS

652
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
THAT IS GOING TO ALSO IMPACT

653
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
PEOPLE'S EMOTIONAL WELL BEING,

654
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
AND WE NEED TO GEAR OURSELVES UP

655
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
FOR THAT FALLOUT BECAUSE IT'S

656
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
COMING, BECAUSE THIS IS A

657
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
HORRIBLE THING.

658
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
>> THE NEWS OUT OF NEWTOWN IS

659
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
TRAUMATIC FOR PARENTS AND FOR

660
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
CHILDREN.
THIS HAPPENED AT A SCHOOL WHERE

661
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
KIDS ARE SUPPOSED TO FEEL SAFE.

662
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
>> HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS TO

663
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
CHILDREN?
WELL, AGAIN, DEPENDS ON THE AGE

664
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
OF THE CHILD.

665
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
BUT I THINK SIMPLE, FORTHRIGHT

666
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
EXPLANATIONS ARE THE BEST.

667
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I

668
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
TELL CHILDREN IS THERE ARE SOME

669
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
BAD PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND

670
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
SOMETIMES BAD PEOPLE DO REALLY

671
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
TERRIBLE THINGS.

672
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
AND A TERRIBLE THING HAS

673
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
HAPPENED AND THERE HAVE BEEN

674
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
SOME CHILDREN KILLED AND THIS IS

675
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
TERRIBLE, BUT YOU'RE SAFE, AND,

676
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SAFE AND YOU'RE

677
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
IN A SITUATION NOW WHERE YOU'RE

678
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
NOT GOING TO BE HARMED.

679
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
>> Reporter: THE AMERICAN

680
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS OFFERS
THIS ADVICE.

681
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE AGE OF THE

682
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
CHILD AND PROVIDE BASIC

683
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
INFORMATION WITHOUT OFFERING

684
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
DETAILS THAT MAY ONLY ALARM

685
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
THEM.
ASK YOUR CHILDREN WHAT THEY

686
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
ALREADY KNOW AND ANSWER

687
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
QUESTIONS.

688
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
PARENTS CAN SHARE THEIR OWN

689
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
FEELINGS IN THE WAYS THEY'RE

690
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
COPING AND FIND MEANINGFUL WAYS

691
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
TO HELP OTHERS.

692
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
>> CHILDREN ARE RESILIENT.

693
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
AND WHAT REALLY MATTERS NOW IS

694
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
HOW WE HELP THEM UNDERSTAND

695
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
WHAT'S HAPPENED, BUT EVEN MORE

696
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
IMPORTANT IS THE SENSE OF

697
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
PROTECTION AND SAFETY THAT WE

698
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
GIVE THEM STARTING THIS MOMENT

699
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
AND FOR THE NEXT WEEKS AND

700
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
MONTHS.
>> FOR THOSE WHO WITNESSED THOSE

701
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
CHILDREN WHO SAW, THOSE WHO

702
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
COVERED THEIR EYES AND EARS TO

703
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
SHUT OUT THE HORROR, THEY NEED

704
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
TIME, LOVE, AND PRAYERS.

705
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID IT THAT

706
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
PARENTS ARE GOING TO GO HOME,

707
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
HUG THEIR CHILDREN, AND EVEN TO

708
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
PROCESS THIS AS A NATION.

709
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
THAT'S JUST GOING TO TAKE TIME.

710
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000

A MOMENT.

714
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
BUT FIRST, LET'S GO TO CNN'S

HE HAS URGED EGYPTIANS TO

726
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
SUPPORT IT, BUT SOME OPPOSITION

727
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
PARTIES WANT THEM TO REJECT IT.

728
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
THEY FEAR THIS WILL CONSOLIDATE

729
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
ISLAMIST POWER AND SAY IT

730
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
