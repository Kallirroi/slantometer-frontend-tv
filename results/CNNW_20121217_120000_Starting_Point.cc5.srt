SHOOTER, HOW POLICE SAY HE GOT

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
INTO THE SCHOOL AND WHY HE MAY

SANDRA ENDO, TODAY WILL BE ONE

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
OF THE TOUGHEST DAYS, SANDRA, AS

THEY TRY TO PUT INTO WORDS, MAKE

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
SOME KIND OF SENSE OF THESE

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
FUNERALS OF THESE LITTLE BOYS.

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000

OF THIS COMMUNITY BEING FELT

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA

>> I COME TO OFFER THE LOVE AND

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
PRAYERS OF A NATION.

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I AM VERY MINDFUL THAT MERE

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
WORDS CANNOT MATCH THE DEPTHS OF

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
YOUR SORROW, NOR CAN THEY HEAL

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
YOUR WOUNDED HEARTS.

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I CAN ONLY HOPE IT HELPS FOR YOU

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
YOUR GRIEF.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
>> AND PRESIDENT OBAMA ALSO MET

PRESIDENT OBAMA HOLDING HER

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
GRANDDAUGHTER, BUT NOT AS PROUD

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
AS I AM OF HER.

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
AND TODAY MARKS THE FIRST DAY OF

POZNER WILL BE LAID TO REST.

JUST TURNED 6 LAST MONTH,

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
SURVIVED BY HIS TWIN SISTER.

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
FAMILY MEMBERS SAY DO NOT KNOW

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
EXACTLY THE WAY HER BROTHER

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
DIED.
ALSO BEING BURIED TODAY,

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
6-YEAR-OLD JACK PINTO.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
A HUGE SPORTS FAN AND ONE OF HIS

120
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
FAVORITE STARS WAS NEW YORK

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
GIANTS RECEIVER VICTOR CRUZ.

122
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
CRUZ ON THE FIELD THIS WEEKEND,

123
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
PAID TRIBUTE TO PINTO, WRITING

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
ON HIS GLOVE.

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
TODAY'S GAME IS FOR YOU, JACK.

126
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
SOLEDAD AND JOHN, BACK TO YOU.

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
>> SUCH A MOVING TRIBUTE FROM

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
VICTOR CRUZ AND THERE WERE TRICK

129
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
OUT

130
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
TRIBUTES ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY

131
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
FROM FOOTBALL TEAMS.

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
FUNERALS AND FOR KIDS IN

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
CONNECTICUT, THE FIRST DAY BACK

135
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
TO SCHOOL, BUT NOT YET IN

136
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
NEWTOWN.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
PLANS FOR THE SANDY HOOK

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ITSELF?

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT, JOHN.

140
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
ALL SCHOOLS IN NEWTOWN WILL BE

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
CLOSED TODAY.
THAT'S FOR STAFF TO BE ABLE TO

142
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
TALK TO EXPERTS, TO FIGURE OUT

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
HOW TO DEAL WITH STUDENTS IN

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
THIS AFTERMATH OF THE TRAGEDY,

145
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
AND TOMORROW CLASSES WILL RESUME

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
EXCEPT FOR AT SANDY HOOK

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
ELEMENTARY.

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
ACCOMMODATED BY A NEIGHBORING

149
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
SCHOOL IN A NEIGHBORING TOWN.

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
JOHN, AND SOLEDAD.

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
>> SOME OF THE KIDS WILL BE

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
GETTING BACK TO SCHOOL AS SOON

153
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
AS TOMORROW.

154
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
REALLY, REALLY QUICKLY.

155
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
>> I IMAGINE THE ROUTINE WOULD

156
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
BE BETTER THAN KEEPING THEM OUT

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
OF SCHOOL.

158
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I UNDERSTAND THE IDEA OF PARENTS

159
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
NOT WANTING TO LET THEIR

160
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
CHILDREN GO ANYWHERE NEAR A

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
SCHOOL.

162
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
BUT FOR KIDS, GETTING BACK TO

163
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
ROUTINE MIGHT BE HELPFUL.
>> GETTING KIDS BACK TOGETHER

164
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
IMPORTANT.

165
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
>> AS THIS IS HAPPENING, POLICE

166
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
VEST DIVISION INTO THE MASINVES

167
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
SWING.

168
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
>> CONNECTICUT POLICE HAVE
CONFIRMED THE IDENTITY OF THE

169
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
GUNMAN, THE FACT THAT HE USED A

170
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
SE

171
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC ASSAULT WEAPON TO

172
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
BLAST HIS WAY THROUGH.

173
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
ALISON KOSIK HAS THE LATEST.

174
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
ALISON, GOOD MORNING.

175
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
>> GOOD MORNING, SOLEDAD.

176
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
WE'RE GETTING A CLOSER LOOK AT

177
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
WHERE THE GUNMAN LIVED WITH HIS

178
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
MOTHER NANCY, A VERY QUIET,

179
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOOD HERE IN

180
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
SANDY HOOK.

181
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THE HOUSE IS A BIG HOUSE SITTING

182
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
ON TOP OF THE HILL.

183
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
EVEN A WREATH ABOVE THE FRONT

184
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
DOOR.
WE'RE ALSO LEARNING NEW DETAILS

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
OF HOW THE GUNMAN GOT INTO THE

186
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
SCHOOL, DESPITE THE FACT THAT

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THE SCHOOL HAD SECURITY, THAT IT

LOCKED ITS DOORS AT 9:30, HAD TO

189

BE BUZZED INTO THE SCHOOL.

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000

197
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000

AS FOR MOTIVE, AUTHORITIES ARE

219
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000

221
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000

THIS IS A VERY LONG, TEDIOUS

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
PROCESS.

228
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
WEAPONS THIS GUNMAN HAS,

GUN RANGES AND GUN DEALERS IN

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
THE AREA.

234
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000

274
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
7-YEAR-OLD JOSEPHINE GAY LIKED

275
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
TO RIDE HER BIKE IN THE STREET

276
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000

293
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
SOLEDAD.
>> ZORAIDA, I'M SO GLAD YOU ARE

294
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000

295
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
SO NICE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE

296
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
CHILDREN AND SOME OF THE

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
VICTIMS.
SOMETIMES WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME

298
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
ON THE SUSPECT AND ALL THE

299
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
INVESTIGATION AROUND THE

300
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
SUSPECT.
SO MUCH NICER TO FOCUS ON THOSE

301
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
WHOSE LIVES SHOULD BE

302
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
REMEMBERED.

303
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000

ARE YOU A PASTOR HERE, FATHER OF

309
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
FIVE AS WELL.

310
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED FROM

311
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
LIVING THROUGH THE COLUMBINE

312
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
EXPERIENCE THAT ARE YOU NOW ABLE

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000

314
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE YOU

315
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
PASTORING?

316
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
>> I THINK MAYBE JUST THE

317
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
GENERAL EXPERIENCE OF GOING

318
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THROUGH IT, UNDERSTANDING HOW IT

319
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
AFFECTS PEOPLE, HOW IT AFFECTS

320
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
THE COMMUNITY AND TRYING TO BE

321
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
THERE FOR PEOPLE IN THE MIDST OF

322
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
THAT AGAIN.
JUST HAVING GONE THROUGH IT, I

323
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
THINK REALLY THAT'S THE ONLY

324
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
THING.
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN BE

325
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
PREPARED FOR IT, ESPECIALLY TO

326
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
HAPPEN A SECOND TIME.

327
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
VERY SHOCKING STILL.

328
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
>> I BET.

329
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
YOU HAVE BEEN HOLDING VIGILS.

330
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
WHAT DO YOU TELL PEOPLE?

331
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
AS A PASTOR, I'M SURE -- AS

332
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
REPORTERS WE ASK THIS ALL THE

333
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
TIME.
WHY?

334
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
THIS CANNOT BE GOD'S PLAN.

335
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
THIS CANNOT BE.

336
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
THIS IS JUST EVIL OVER GOOD.

337
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
>> IT'S NOT GOD'S PLAN.

338
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
EVIL HAS A PERSONA BEHIND IT,

339
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
THERE IS A DEVIL.

340
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
IF YOU ARE CHRISTIAN, YOU HAVE

341
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
TO BELIEVE THAT.

342
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
WE TRY TO APPROACH IT FROM THE

343
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
UNSEEN REALM.

344
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
THERE ARE SOMETIMES THINGS GOING

345
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
ON IN THE UNSEEN REALM THAT IS

346
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
SEEN IN THE SCEEEN REALM.

347
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
THAT'S WHY WE PRAY.

348
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
>> THIS COMMUNITY DOESN'T WANT

349
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
TO BE DEFINED BY THIS TRAGEDY.

350
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

351
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
>> MY JOB, HELPING THEM GET IN

352
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
TOUCH WITH THE LORD, GET IN

353
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
TOUCH WITH GOD, AND THEN LET THE

354
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
LORD BRING THE LIVES OF THE

355
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
PEOPLE TOUCHED HERE, AFFECTED

356
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
HERE, WHATEVER HEMENTS TO DO IN

357
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
THIS TOWN.
MY JOB IS SIMPLE REALLY.

358
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
GET PEOPLE TO PRAY.

359
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE A HARD

360
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
TIME BELIEVING IN GOD OR

361
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
SEEING -- UNDERSTANDING WHY THIS

362
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
HAPPENED.

363
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
SO WE TRY TO TELL OUR

364
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
PARISHIONERS AND OTHER PEOPLE,

365
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
WHY DON'T WE PRAY.

366
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
IF WE DON'T BELIEVE NOW, LET'S

367
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
PRETEND LIKE WE DO IN PRAYER

368
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
UNTIL WE DO.

369
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
LET THE LORD HAVE HIS HAND IN

370
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
NEWTOWN.

ALL TYPES OF THINGS.

SEEMS TO BE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT

TYPE OF THING.

HOW DO YOU PREPARE?

>> IT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.

450
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
AND PARTICULARLY WHEN WE TALK

451
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
ABOUT ELEMENTARY SCHOOLCHILDREN.

452
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
HIGH SCHOOLS IS DIFFICULT

453
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
ENOUGH.

454
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
BUT IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, THIS

455
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
IS COMPLETELY UNCHARTERED

456
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
TERRITORY.

457
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
PREPARING MEANS SEVERAL CONCRETE

458
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
STEPS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN.

459
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
ONE IS VERY SERIOUS CONTROL OF

460
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
ENTRY INTO THE SCHOOLS AND THIS

461
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
HAS TO BE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY,

462
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
AND I THINK IN MOST SCHOOLS,

463
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
THEY ARE STARTING TO GET THAT

464
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
PICTURE, SECONDLY, THERE HAS TO

465
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
BE A VERY CLEAR PLAN ABOUT WHAT

466
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
TO DO IN THE EVENT OF A

467
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
SITUATION LIKE WE EXPERIENCED

468
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
HERE.
AND IN THIS SITUATION, ACTUALLY,

469
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
THE SCHOOL SEEMED TO BE REALLY

470
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
QUITE AMAZINGLY PREPARED IN

471
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
TERMS OF PEOPLE KNOWING WHAT

472
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
THEY NEEDED TO DO, HAVING A

473
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
LOCKDOWN PROCEDURE, AND HAVING

474
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
THE TEACHERS BE SO

475
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
EXTRAORDINARILY, REALLY HEROIC,

476
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
IN FOLLOWING THE PLAN, IN

477
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
FOLLOWING THEIR OWN JUDGMENT

478
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
ABOUT WHAT TO DO TO PROTECT AS

479
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
MANY KIDS AS POSSIBLE, AND UNDER

480
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THEY DID

481
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
REALLY WELL.

482
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
BUT WE REALLY ARE IN UNCHARTERED

483
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
TERRITORY IN FIGURING OUT

484
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
EXACTLY HOW MUCH FURTHER WE NEED

485
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
TO DO.

486
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
PEOPLE ARE MENTIONING WHETHER WE

487
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
WANT SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS BEING

488
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
ARMED, WHICH I DON'T AGREE WITH,

489
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
OR SHOULD THERE BE A POLICE

490
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
PRESENCE?

491
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF ISSUES

492
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
NOW THAT WILL BE BROUGHT UP AND

493
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000

494
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
PLACE BEFORE WE COME TO A

495
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
CONCLUSION ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO

496
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
BE DONE HERE.

497

FAMILY NO QUESTION THE HELP

BUT EVEN WHEN THAT'S THE CASE,

538
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000

734
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
EDITION OF "STARTING POINT,"

735
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
COMING TO YOU FROM NEWTOWN,

736
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
CONNECTICUT.
THIS COMMUNITY WILL BURY TWO

737
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
6-YEAR-OLD BOYS TODAY, THE FIRST

738
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
OF MORE THAN TWO DOZEN FUNERALS

739
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
THAT THIS TOWN HAS TO ENDURE

740
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
AFTER FRIDAY'S MASSACRE AT THE

741
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

742
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
THE PLAN FOR SURVIVING STUDENTS

743
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
IS TO RETURN THEM TO CLASS AS

744
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
SOON AS POSSIBLE.

745
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
THEY WILL EVENTUALLY USE THE

746
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
CHALK HILL SCHOOL IN MONROE,

747
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
CONNECTICUT.
ABOUT SEVEN MILES FROM HERE.

748
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
>> PEOPLE NATIONWIDE ARE PAYING

749
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
RESPECTS WITH THE TWITTER

750
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
CAMPAIGN, URGING EVERYONE TO

751
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
WEAR GREEN AND WHITE TODAY.

752
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
THOSE WERE -- THOSE ARE SANDY

753
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
HOOK SCHOOL COLORS.

754
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS HERE,

755
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
CONSOLING GRIEF-STRICKEN PARENTS

756
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
AND BRINGING THEM A MESSAGE.

757
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
>> I COME TO OFFER THE LOVE AND

758
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
PRAYERS OF A NATION.

759
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
>> OUR MAIN FOCUS IS ON THE

760
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
VICTIMS, BUT WE ARE ALSO

761
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE GUNMAN

762
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
TODAY.
A RELATIVE SAYS HE WAS PULLED

763
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
OUT OF THE NEWTOWN SCHOOL SYSTEM

764
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
BY HIS MOTHER, WHO WAS UNHAPPY

765
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
WITH THEIR PLANS FOR HER

766
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
TROUBLED SON.
>> AND YOU SAW A MOMENT AGO AS

767
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS

768
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
WALKED INTO WHERE THEY WERE

769
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
HOLDING A VIGIL AND HOW PEOPLE

770
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
WERE CHEERING AND PATTING THEM

771
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
ON THE BACK.

772
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
SUCH AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT ON THE

773
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
VIGIL.

774
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
THEY HAVE BEEN A ROCK FOR THIS

775
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
COMMUNITY.
IMAGINE WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN IN

776
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
RESPONDING TO THAT ELEMENTARY

777
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
SCHOOL.
MUST BE A ON HORRIBLE THING FOR

778
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
THEM.
WE WANT TO TURN TO JOHN LOTT,

779
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
AUTHOR OF A BOOK CALLED "MORE

780
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
GUNS, LESS CRIME."

781
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
THAT'S HIS THEORY IN A NUTSHELL.

782
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
IF PEOPLE HAD MORE GUNS, THERE

783
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
WOULD BE MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR

784
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
SELF-DEFENSE, AND NOT ONLY WOULD

785
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
HE NOT LIKE TO SEE NEW GUN LAWS,

786
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE CURRENT

787
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
LAWS TAKEN OFF THE BOOKS ALL

788
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
TOGETHER.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.

789
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
ON FRIDAY, YOU WERE TALKING TO

790
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
PIERS AND WITH WOLF YESTERDAY,

791
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
AND YOU SAID IT'S TIME TO GET

792
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
RID OF GUN LAWS, THE TAKEAWAY

793
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
FOR YOU OF THIS MASSACRE AT AN

794
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IT'S TIME TO

795
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
GET RID OF GUN LAWS.

796
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
HOW DOES THAT POSSIBLY MAKE

797
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
SENSE TO YOU?

798
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
>> WELL, BECAUSE OF MY RESEARCH,

799
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'VEALKED TO DOZENS OF PEOPLE

800
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
WHO HAVE BEEN PRESENT AT

801
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
HORRIBLE EVENTS OVER TIME, AND

802
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
THE FEELING OF UTTER

803
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
HELPLESSNESS IS OVERWHELMING FOR

804
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
THESE INDIVIDUALS.
IT'S HARD TO THINK OF SOMETHING

805
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
MORE TERRIFYING THAN BEING

806
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
HELPLESS THERE WHEN ONE OF THESE

807
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
ATTACKS OCCURS.

808
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
THERE IS ONE COMMON FEATURE

809
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
ACROSS THE ATTACKS.

810
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
THE ONES THE PRESIDENT

811
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
MENTIONED, YOU GO BACK FROM 1950

812
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
AT LEAST ON, WITH ONLY ONE

813
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
EXCEPTION, ALL THE MULTIPLE

814
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
VICTIM PUBLIC SHOOTINGS HAVE

815
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
OCCURRED WHERE MORE THAN THREE

816
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED, HAVE

817
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
OCCURRED WHERE GUNS ARE BANNED.

818
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
WE TRY TO MAKE AN AREA SAFE BY

819
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
BANNING GUNS, BUT WHAT HAPPENS

820
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
IS, IT'S A LAW-ABIDING GOOD

821
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
CITIZENS WHO OBEY THE BAN AND

822
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
NOT THE CRIMINALS, AND RATHER

823
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
THAN MAKING --
>> BUT MORE THAN ONE THING IN

824
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
COMMON, RIGHT?

825
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
THERE IS ONE MORE THING IN

826
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
COMMON.
ONE THING IS COMMON IS THAT

827
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
SOMETHING HAS WEAPONS TOO, AND

828
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
THEY GO INTO A PLACE WHERE THEY

829
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
SHOULD NOT BE WITH A WEAPON.

830
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
SO I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT JUST ONE

831
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
THING IN COMMON.

832
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
THEY ARE ALSO ARMED OFTEN TO THE

833
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
HIT AND WITH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS

834
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
OR SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

835
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
>> NEVER WITH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS,

836
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
BUT WITH SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS,

837
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
SURE.
BUT HERE IS THE POINT.

838
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
WE ONLY HAVE TINY AREAS IN THE

839
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
UNITED STATES WHERE THAW ARE

840
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
COMPLETELY GUN-FREE ZONES, BUT

841
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
TIME AFTER TIME, THAT'S THE

842
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
PLACE THESE CRIMINALS GO.

843
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
TAKE THE AURORA, COLORADO, MOVIE

844
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
THEATER SHOOTINGS.

845
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
SEVEN MOVIE THEATERS WITHIN A

846
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
20-MINUTE CAR RIDE OF THE

847
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
KILLER'S APARTMENT.

848
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
ONLY ONE THAT BANNED GUNS.

849
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
HE DIDN'T GO TO THE MOVIE

850
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
THEATER CLOSEST TO HIS HOME.

851
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
HE DIDN'T GO TO THE MOVIE

852
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
THEATER THAT WAS LARGEST.

853
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
THE ONE HE WENT TO WAS THE ONLY

854
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
ONE THAT BANNED GUNS, AND YOU

855
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
SEE THAT --

856
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
>> LET ME STOP YOU THERE.

857
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
LET ME STOP YOU THERE.

858
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
HERE, AGAIN, A CASE WHERE

859
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
SOMEONE HAD A SEMI AUTOMATIC

860
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
RIFFLE, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT HE

861
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
CHOSE THAT BECAUSE THEY BANNED

862
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
GUNS?
HAVE TALKED TO HIM?

863
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYWHERE IN ANY

864
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
TRANSIT OF ANYTHING HE HAS SAID

865
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
THAT HE PICKED IT SPECIFICALLY

866
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
FOR THAT.
HE HAS NOT SPOKEN TO THE MEDIA.

867
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

868
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

869
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
>> OKAY.

870
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
THERE ARE TWO POINTS.

871
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
ONE, I DON'T KNOW IN THIS

872
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
PARTICULAR CASE.

873
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
HE PICKS ONE OUT OF SEVEN.

874
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
ONLY ONE THERE, AND THE POINT

875
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
IS, EVERY TIME.

876
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
GO LOOK AT THE MALL SHOOTINGS,

877
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
MOST OF THE MALLS IN THE AREA

878
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
AREN'T POSTED AS GUN-FREE ZONES,

879
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
THE ONLY ONES THEY PICK ARE THE

880
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
ONES THAT ARE BANNED.

881
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
PICK THE COLUMBINE CASE.

882
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW -- LET

883
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
ME GIVE YOU ONE PIECE OF

884
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
INFORMATION HERE.
TAKE THE COLUMBINE CASE.

885
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
DID YOU THANK DYLAN KLEBOLD WAS

886
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
WRITING STATE LEGISLATORS,

887
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
STRONGLY AGAINST IT,

888
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
PARTICULARLY UPSET A LAW THAT

889
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
WOULD ALLOW CONCEALED HANDGUNS

890
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
ON SCHOOL PROPERTY AND THE DAY

891
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
THE COLUMBINE ATTACK OCCURRED,

892
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
IT OCCURRED ON THE DAY OF FINAL

893
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
PASSAGE OF THE STATE CONCEALED

894
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
HANDGUN LAW.
>> BUT, LISTEN, WHY IS YOUR

895
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
TAKEAWAY.
>> THAT IS AT COLUMBINE.

896
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
>> WHY IS YOUR TAKEAWAY TO GET

897
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
RID OF GUN LAWS RATHER THAN

898
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT SHOULD NOT

899
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
HAVE ACCESS TO WEAPONS.

900
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, WE KNOW

901
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
THAT THE INVESTIGATION IS JUST

902
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
AT THE BEGINNING STAGES, BUT WE

903
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
KNOW HE USED A SEMIAUTOMATIC

904
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
RIFLE TO BLOW OUT THE GLASS WALL

905
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
AT THE SCHOOL.

906
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
THE SECURITY IS USELESS.

907
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
WHY?
BECAUSE HE HAD A HIGH-VELOCITY,

908
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
MULTISHOT WITH MANY ROUNDS WITH

909
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
HIM TO ACCESS THE SCHOOL.

910
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
WHY WOULD YOU NOT SAY, THAT'S

911
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
EXACTLY THE KIND OF WEAPON THAT

912
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
SOMEONE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

913
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
EASILY GET THEIR HANDS ON?

914
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
AND HE WAS ABLE EASILY TO GET

915
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
HIS HANDS ON IT.

916
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
IT WAS LEGALLY REGISTERED TO HIS

917
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
MOTHER.
WHY IS THAT NOT YOUR TAKEAWAY?

918
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
>> YOU KNOW WHAT COUNTRY HAD TWO

919
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
OF THE THREE WORST PUBLIC

920
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
SHOOTINGS PRIOR TO FRIDAY?

921
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
IT WAS GERMANY.

922
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
GERMANY HAD THREE OF THE FIVE

923
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
WORST PUBLIC SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IN

924
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
THE WORLD.

925
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
NOW, THEY HAVE EXTREMELY STRICT

926
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
GUN CONTROL LAWS.

927
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
YOU CAN'T GET SEMIAUTOMATIC

928
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
WEAPONS.

929
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
IT TAKES A YEAR TO GET A BOLT

930
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
ACTION LONG RIFLE THERE.

931
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
YET THEY HAS THE WORST RECORD

932
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
THAN WE HAVE HERE IN THE UNITED

933
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
STATES, EVEN WITH THIS ATTACK.

934
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
SO I --
>> I DON'T SEE HOW ANY OF THAT

935
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
BRINGS YOU TO THE DECISION THAT

936
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
THE ANSWER IS TO GET RID OF GUN

937
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
LAWS.
THE OTHER QUESTION I WOULD ASK

938
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
YOU --

939
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
>> BECAUSE THEY SERVE AS A

940
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
MAGNET FOR THESE ATTACKS.

941
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
>> OR -- OR A RATIONAL PERSON

942
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
COULD SAY -- OR A RATIONAL

943
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
PERSON COULD SAY THAT HAVING

944
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
ACCESS TO A HIGH-POWERED

945
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE IS

946
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
INAPPROPRIATE.
THAT THERE IS NO REASON TO GO

947
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
DEER HUNTING WITH THAT, NO

948
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
REASON TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT.

949
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THAT'S THE CONNECTION THAT THESE

950
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
KILLERS HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE

951
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
WEAPONS.
LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION.

952
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
>> NO, I WANT TO ANSWER THAT

953
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
THAT YOU JUST SAID.

954
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
NO, I DON'T ARGUE SECOND

955
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
AMENDMENT.

956
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I ARGUE CRIME.

957
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

958
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I WANT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

959
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
HERE.
THESE GUNS ARE JUST LIKE ANY

960
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
HUNTING RIFLE.

961
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
THE INSIDE GUTS, THEY FIRE ONE

962
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
BULLET.
IN FACT, BUSHMASTER GUN THERE

963
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
IS -- WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF

964
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
A RIFLE THAT WOULD BE USED FOR

965
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
HUNTING VERY SMALL GAME, LIKE

966
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
SQUIRRELS.
IT LOOKS DIFFERENT ON THE

967
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
OUTSIDE, BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE

968
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
LIKE TO HAVE GUNS THAT LOOK LIKE

969
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
MILITARY WEAPONS, BUT IT'S NOT.

970
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
IT'S LIKE ANY HUNTING RIFLE.

971
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
>> SIR, SIR --

972
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
>> IF YOU WANT TO BAN ALL

973
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
HUNTING RIFLES, THAT'S FINE.

974
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
>> SIR, IF YOU ARE TRYING TO

975
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
KILL A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN

976
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
A MASSACRE, THAT'S THE KIND OF

977
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
GUN YOU GRAB.

978
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
>> A HUNTING RIFLE WOULD DO THE

979
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
SAME THING.

980
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
>> IF YOU COULD INFLICT AS MUCH

981
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
CARNAGE ON PEOPLE, THAT'S THE

982
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
KIND OF GUN YOU GRAB.

983
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
HOW YOU COULD SAY WE SHOULD HAVE

984
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
FEWER LAWS, NOT MORE, IT BOGGLES

985
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
THE MIND.

986
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
IF YOU WOULD COME AND TALK TO

987
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN HERE,

988
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
THEY WOULD BE STUNNED BY YOU.

989
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
>> UNFORTUNATELY, I TALKED TO

990
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
MULTIPLE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN

991
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
VICTIMS OF PUBLIC SHOOTINGS.

992
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
GUNS ARE BENEFICIAL FOR

993
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
SELF-DEFENSE.

994
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
IF YOU HAD TWO CRIMINALS COMING

995
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
AT YOU, YOU DON'T WANT A GUN

996
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
THAT ONLY FIRES ONE SHOT LIKE

997
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

998
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

999
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
YOU CAN'T EVEN FIRE A WARNING

1000
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
SHOT.

1001
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
IF YOU MISS THE FIRST SHOT AND

1002
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
YOU DON'T HAVE A SEMIAUTOMATIC

1003
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
GUN, WHAT DO YOU DO FOR

1004
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
SELF-DEFENSE AT THIS POINT?

1005
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
>> AND IF YOU HAVE -- IF YOU

1006
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
HAVE A MAN WHO SEEMS TO BE

1007
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
TROUBLED AND HE IS ARMED WITH A

1008
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPON, A RIFLE,

1009
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
THEN THERE IS A HIGH LIKELIHOOD

1010
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
THAT IS HE GOING TO MASSACRE A

1011
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
LOT OF PEOPLE IN ONE LOCATION,

1012
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
SIR, IN A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF

1013
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
TIME.

1014
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
WE COULD CONTINUE THIS DEBATE

1015
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
FOR A LONG TIME, I APPRECIATE

1016
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
YOU TALKING WITH ME THIS

1017
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
MORNING, BUT I JUST -- I HAVE TO

1018
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
SAY, YOUR POSITION -- YOUR

1019
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
POSITION COMPLETELY BOGGLES ME,

1020
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
HONESTLY.
I JUST DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT.

1021
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
THANK YOU FOR TALKING WITH US.

1022
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
>>> I WANT TO BRING IN DEEPAK

1023
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
CHOPRA.

1024
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
BECAUSE I GET SO FRUSTRATED AT

1025
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
TIMES WHEN I HAVE THESE

1026
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
CONVERSATIONS AND MANY PEOPLE

1027
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
POINT BACK TO THE SECOND

1028
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
AMENDME

1029
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
AMENDMENT, WHICH WE SHOULD READ
FOR EVERYBODY, BECAUSE IT'S USED

1030
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
OFTEN AS A POSITION.

1031
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
>> REMEMBER, SOLEDAD, WHEN THE

1032
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
SECOND AMENDMENT WAS WRITTEN,

1033
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
PEOPLE HAD MUSKETS, IT TOOK 20

1034
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
MINUTES TO LOAD ONE AND HALF THE

1035
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
TIME THEY MISSED.

1036
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
THE SECOND AMENDMENT WASN'T

1037
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
WRITTEN FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS,

1038
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
AMMUNITION, AND THE EASY

1039
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
AVAILABILITY OF THESE GUNS OF

1040
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
MASS DESTRUCTION OVER THE

1041
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
INTERNET.

1042
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
>> HERE IS WHAT IT SAYS.

1043
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
A WELL-REGULATED MILITIA, BEING

1044
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
NECESSARY FOR THE SECURITY OF

1045
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
THE PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND

1046
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
BEAR ARMS SHALL NOT BE INFRIN  D

1047
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
INFRINGED.
IT DOESN'T MENTION ASSAULT

1048
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
WEAPONS.
>> THERE WEREN'T ANY.

1049
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
>> I GUESS RIGHT NOW PEOPLE SEEM

1050
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
VERY FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY ABOUT

1051
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
WHERE WE ARE IN IN COUNTRY IN

1052
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
THE DEBATE OVER MENTAL HEALTH

1053
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
AND WEAPONS.

1054
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
KIND OF THE INTERSECTION OF

1055
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
THOSE TWO THINGS.

1056
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I GET THE SENSE OFTEN WE WRING

1057
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
OUR HANDS UNTIL THE NEXT

1058
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
TRAGEDY, THERE MAY NOT BE

1059
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
ANYTHING TANGIBLY DONE.

1060
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
>> SEE, ONE SINGLE MENTALLY

1061
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
UNSTABLE PERSON BROUGHT THE

1062
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
WHOLE COUNTRY TO THIS STATE OF

1063
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
DEEP SORROW, ANGUISH.

1064
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
IF THAT DOESN'T GALVANIZE OUR

1065
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
COLLECTIVE PSYCHE TO CHANGE

1066
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
THESE LAWS, THEN WE ARE GOING TO

1067
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
LIVE FOR THE NEXT HALF A CENTURY

1068
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
IN A CULTURE OF VIOLENCE.

1069
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
THERE IS NO OTHER COUNTRY, NO

1070
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
OTHER ADVANCED COUNTRY --

1071
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
>> PEOPLE COULD TICK OFF AND YOU

1072
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
KNOW THIS WELL, NOT ONLY MENTAL

1073
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
HEALTH ISSUES, NOT ONLY EASY

1074
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
ACCESS TO GUNS.

1075
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
MOVIES, ABSOLUTELY GLORIFY

1076
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
VIOLENCE, VIDEO GAMES SEEM TO BE

1077
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
RELEVANT IN THIS CASE,

1078
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
ESPECIALLY VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES,

1079
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
AND EVERYBODY LIKES TO POINT --

1080
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
>> ALL OF THAT IS PART OF THE

1081
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
CONTEXT, BUT YOU CANNOT KILL ON

1082
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
THE SCALE UNLESS HAVE YOU A GUN.

1083
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
OH, PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE, NOT

1084
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
GUNS, BUT PEOPLE USE GUNS TO

1085
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
KILL.
YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE TO SLOWLY

1086
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
CREATE A CULTURE OF KINDNESS AND

1087
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
LOVE AND COMPASSION AND EMPATHY,

1088
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
THAT'S WHAT A CIVIL SOCIETY

1089
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
SHOULD BE DOING.
IN THE MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE TO

1090
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
ACTUALLY GET RID OF THE ASSAULT

1091
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
WEAPONS THAT ARE DIRECTLY

1092
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KILLING.

1093
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
>> ALL RIGHT, DEPACK.

1094
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
WE HAVE TO WRAP THIS UP.

1095
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
WE HAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS.

1096
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000

1238
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
A QUESTION VERY PERSONAL TO ME.

1239
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I AM STRUGGLING HOW TO TALK TO

1240
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
MY KIDS, WHETHER TO TALK TO MY

1241
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
KIDS.
ARE THERE RIGHT ANSWERS HERE?

1242
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
>> I THINK THE ANSWER OF TALKING

1243
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
TO YOUR KIDS AS OPPOSED TO

1244
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
IGNORING IT IS PROBABLY THE ONLY

1245
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
RIGHT ANSWER.

1246
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
AND ASSUMING THEY WILL FIND OUT.

1247
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I KNOW YOU BOTH HAVE CHILDREN.

1248
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
YOU BOTH HAVE TWINS.

1249
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
AND I HAVE A 7, 5, AND

1250
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
3-YEAR-OLD.
MY 7-YEAR-OLD ALREADY KNEW ABOUT

1251
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
IT I'M POSITIVE MY 5-YEAR-OLD

1252
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
WILL LEARN ABOUT IT TODAY AND

1253
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
WE'RE ALREADY PREPPING FOR THAT

1254
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
CONVERSATION.
I THINK THAT THE IDEA THAT YOU

1255
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
CHECK YOUR OWN FEELINGS FIRST,

1256
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
IN MEDICINE, CHECK YOUR OWN

1257
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
PULSE BEFORE GOING INTO A CODE,

1258
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
IN THIS SITUATION, CHECKING YOUR

1259
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
OWN FEELINGS.

1260
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
DON'T OVERTALK TO YOUR CHILD.

1261
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
THAT IS A CONSTANT CONCERN I'VE

1262
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000

00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
YOU LET THEM TALK FIRST.

00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
SEE WHAT THEY ARE SAYING, WHAT

1265
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
THEY KNOW.

1266
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FEELINGS AND

1267
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
AS APPROPRIATE, FILL IN DETAILS.

1268
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
DON'T BE GRAPHIC, PROBABLY NOT

1269
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
APPROPRIATE AT ANY AGE.

1270
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000

1271
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000

00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
SAFE?
MY KIDS TALKING ABOUT IT.

1273
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
VERY UPSET.

1274
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I'VE BEEN GONE A COUPLE OF DAYS.

1275
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
AND WALK IN THE DOOR, THEY ARE

1276
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
HAPPY TO SEE YOU, AND THEN BURST

1277
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
INTO TEARS, BECAUSE THIS IS VERY

1278
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
UPSETTING.
>> YOU DON'T LIE.

1279
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
EVERYONE SAYS THAT LOSS OF

1280
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
INNOCENCE -- I REMEMBER,

1281
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
SOLEDAD, WHEN WE WERE COVERING

1282
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
SOME OF THE CONFLICTS, AND I

1283
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
REMEMBER BEING IN A RED CROSS

1284
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
TRUCK, AND THE RED CROSS TRUCK I

1285
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
CAME UNDER FIRE, AND I REMEMBER

1286
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
THINKING THE RULES HAVE CHANGED.

1287
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY?

1288
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
>> WHAT I SAID TO MY 7-YEAR-OLD,

1289
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
THIS NEVER HAPPENED IN DADDY'S

1290
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
SCHOOL, NEVER HAPPENED IN
MOMMY'S SCHOOL.

1291
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
IT HAPPENED HERE OBVIOUSLY, BUT

1292
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

1293
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
MAKE SURE IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN

1294
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
TO YOU.

1295
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
KIDS WILL SEE THROUGH IT IF YOU

1296
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
MAKE FALSE PROMISES.

1297
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
>> A WOMAN WROTE A FASCINATING

1298
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
BLOG, SENT AROUND TWITTER.

1299
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
AND IT SAYS I ADAM AM LANZA'S

1300
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
MOTHER.
SHE WRITES ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE

1301
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
WITH HER SON.

1302
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I LIVE WITH A SON WHO IS

1303
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
MENTALLY ILL.

1304
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I LOVE MY SON, BUT HE TERRIFIES

1305
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
ME.
WHEN I ASKED MY SON ABOUT SOCIAL

1306
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
WORKERS WHAT I SHOULD DO, IF IS

1307
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
HE IS IN THE SYSTEM, THERE WILL

1308
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
BE A PAPER TRAIL.

1309
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
NO ONE WILL PAY ATTENTION TO YOU

1310
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
UNLESS HAVE YOU CHARGES.

1311
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I DON'T BELIEVE MY SON BELONGS

1312
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
IN JAIL.

1313
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
HE'S 13 YEARS OLD.

1314
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
>> I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THIS.

1315
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I HAVE DONE A LOT OF REPORTING.

1316
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
RIGHT NOW, SHORT OF GOING INTO

1317
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

1318
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
WHICH YOU WILL GIVE YOUR KID A

1319
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
RECORD, AND PARENTS, IT'S

1320
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
OBVIOUSLY A TOUGH THING.

1321
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
SHORT OF THAT, TO GET SOMEONE

1322
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
IMPATIENT THERAPY, THEY HAVE TO

1323
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
BE AN IMMINENT HARM TO

1324
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
THEMSELVES OR OTHERS.

1325
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, WE HEAR

1326
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
THE FIRST TIME THEY SEE THAT

1327
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
WHEN SOMETHING TRAGIC HAPPENS.

1328
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
THERE WASN'T EVIDENCE OF

1329
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
IMMINENT HARM TO THEMSELVES OR

1330
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
OTHERS. A VERY, VERY HIGH

1331
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
THRESHOLD.
THAT IS NOT PARITY.

1332
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
YOU DON'T GO INTO THE DOCTOR FOR

1333
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
A PHYSICAL ONLY WHEN YOU'RE

1334
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
ABOUT TO DIE.
>> IF YOU HAVE A HEART ATTACK,

1335
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
WE'LL SEE YOU.

1336
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
>> WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT MENTAL

1337
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
HEALTH, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN

1338
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
TALKING ALL MORNING ABOUT IT.

1339
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
THAT'S THE MANIFESTATION OF NOT

1340
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
HAVING THINGS ON PAR.

1341
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
>> WHAT THRESHOLD ARE YOU

1342
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
TALKING ABOUT?
>> RIGHT NOW IT HAS TO BE

1343
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
IMMINENT HARM TO YOURSELF OR TO

1344
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
OTHERS.

1345
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
>> WHAT'S AN APPROPRIATE ONE?

1346
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
>> WELL, IF SOMEONE HAS SYMPTOMS

1347
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
OF MENTAL ILLNESS THAT ARE SHORT

1348
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
OF THAT -- THERE'S ALL SORTS OF

1349
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
DIFFERENT THINGS.

1350
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
WE TALK ABOUT DEPRESSION.

1351
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
THERE'S A WHOLE COMBINATION OF

1352
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
THINGS, CHANGES IN APPETITE,

1353
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
CHANGES IN SLEEPING, ALL THESE

1354
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
TYPES OF THINGS THAT MAY SEEM

1355
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
MINOR IN COMPARISON BUT ARE THE

1356
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
PROGRESSION OF A MUCH MORE

1357
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
SERIOUS ILLNESS.
>> THEN DOES A DOCTOR HAVE TO

1358
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
REPORT THAT?
I HAVE A PATIENT WHO IS SEVERELY

1359
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
MENTALLY ILL, AND THEY COULD DO

1360
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
SOMETHING?
I COULD SEE THE SLIPPERY SLOPE

1361
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE

1362
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
ASKING A TRAINED MENTAL

1363
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
PROFESSIONAL.
>> THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

1364
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
YOU WANT TO GET BEFORE THAT

1365
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
POINT.
YOU WANT TO SEE THEM BEFORE THEY

1366
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
ARE POTENTIALLY IMMINENT HARM TO

1367
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
THEMSELVES OR TO OTHERS.

1368
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
THAT'S THE THING.

1369
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
MENTAL ILLNESS IS TREATED ONLY

1370
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
IN CRISIS SITUATIONS RIGHT NOW.

1371
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
>> EVERY BUDGET CUT CUTS

1372
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
MEDICAID, WHICH IS THE NUMBER

1373
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
ONE HEALTH PROVIDER.

1374
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
>> EVEN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

1375
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
INSURED AND HAVE GOOD RESOURCES,

1376
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
THIS IS A WAY OF LIFE FOR THEM.

1377
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
>> IT IS A TERRIBLE CONUNDRUM.

1378
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THAT

1379
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
INTERSECTION BETWEEN A GUN

1380
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
CULTURE, A VIOLENT CULTURE,

1381
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
ACCESS TO WEAPONS, AND LACK OF

1382
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH

1383
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
ISSUES.

1384
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
REALLY IT'S A TERRIBLE --

1385
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
>> IT'S NOT AN EITHER/OR.

1386
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
YOU'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT BOTH.

1387
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
>> THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN THIS

1388
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
COMMUNITY TURNING TO PLACES OF

1389
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
WORSHIP TO GET A SENSE OF

1390
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
COMFORT.

1391
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO A YOUNG

1392
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
MAN WHO'S A LOCAL RELIGIOUS

1393
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
LEADER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, TALKING

1394
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO HELP

1395
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
THIS SMALL TOWN GRIEVE.

1396
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
A Hybrid? Most are
just no fun to drive.

1397
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Now, here's one that will
make you feel alive.

1398
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Meet the five-passenger
Ford C-MAX Hybrid.

1399
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
C-MAX says ha.

1400
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
C-MAX says wheeee.

1401
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Which is what you get,
don't you see?

1402
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Cause C-MAX has lots more
horsepower than Prius v,

1403
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
a hybrid that C-MAX
also bests in MPG.

1404
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Say hi to the all-new 47
combined MPG C-MAX Hybrid.

1405
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
>>> IT IS IN SUCH TIMES OF

1406
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
ALMOST UNBEARABLE LOSS THAT WE

1407
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
SEEK THE COMFORT WITH OUR

1408
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
CREATOR AND THAT ARTIFICIAL

1409
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
DIVISIONS OF FAITH FALL AWAY TO

1410
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
REVEAL A NATION OF MOTHERS AND

1411
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
FATHERS, BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

1412
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
SONS AND DAUGHTERS -- ALL UNITED

1413
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
IN A DESIRE TO BRING HEALING AND

1414
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
RENEWED HOPE.

1415
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
>> LAST NIGHT THE CLERGY HERE IN

1416
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, GATHERED

1417
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
TO OFFER PRAYERS AND MESS GEAGEF

1418
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
HOPE TO THE GRIEVING

1419
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
COMMUNITIES.

1420
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
YOU JUST SAW THE DIRECTOR OF NEW

1421
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
HADEA CENTER OF NEWTOWN.

1422
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO GIVE

1423
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
CHILDREN COMFORT?

1424
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
YOU'RE THE YOUTH DIRECTOR.

1425
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I KNOW YOU'RE DEALING WITH A LOT

1426
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
OF CHILDREN.
WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY SAY THAT

1427
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
MAKES SENSE OF SOMETHING LIKE

1428
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
THIS?
>> IT'S VERY HARD BECAUSE A LOT

1429
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
OF CHILDREN STILL HAVEN'T REALLY

1430
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
WRAPPED THEIR HEADS AROUND IT,

1431
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
AND I DON'T THINK THEY REALLY

1432
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
WILL UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF

1433
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

1434
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT, ESPECIALLY

1435
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
FOR PEOPLE IN THE SURROUNDING

1436
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
AREAS.
I KNOW A LOT OF TOWNS, NEARBY

1437
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
TOWNS WERE AFFECTED AND ON

1438
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
LOCKDOWN TOO.

1439
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL TRYING TO

1440
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
MAKE SENSE OF EVERYTHING.

1441
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
>> I WAS SPEAKING TO A PARENT OF

1442
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
SOMEONE WHO DIED IN THE VIRGINIA

1443
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
TECH MASSACRE.

1444
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
HE TOLD ME, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO

1445
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
MOVE ON, BUT YOU CAN MOVE

1446
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
FORWARD.
>> YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

1447
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO

1448
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
RETURN TO THINGS BEING NORMAL.

1449
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THAT
KIND OF -- THEY SAY TIME HEALS

1450
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
ALL WOUNDS, BUT THERE'S STILL

1451
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
GOING TO BE A SCAR, IF THAT

1452
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
MAKES SENSE.

1453
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A

1454
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
REMINDER, BUT IT JUST -- YOU

1455
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
HAVE TO JUST KEEP MOVING ON AND

1456
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
TAKE MEASURES TO -- YOU LEARN

1457
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
FROM THE PAST.

1458
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
IT'S -- WHAT'S THE WORD I'M

1459
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
LOOKING FOR?

1460
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE

1461
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
REMINDED OF IT.
THERE'S NO WAY TO FORGET.

1462
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
>> WHEN DO YOU THINK THE FIRST

1463
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
TIME YOU'LL HAVE A SERMON, A

1464
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
FIRST WEEKEND WHEN YOU WILL NOT

1465
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
BE TALKING ABOUT THIS.

1466
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
WHEN WILL THAT BE?

1467
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
IS

1468
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
>> I DON'T KNOW, QUITE HONESTLY.

1469
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE ON

1470
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
EVERYBODY'S MINDS FOR A LONG
TIME.

1471
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
IT'S VERY RAW.

1472
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
IT'S VERY REAL.

1473
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
IT STILL FEELS VERY UNREAL TO

1474
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
PEOPLE, LIKE I'M STILL IN A

1475
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
STATE OF SHOCK.

1476
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I STILL -- IT STILL FEELS WEIRD

1477
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
TO WAKE UP AND REALIZE THIS

1478
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
WASN'T JUST A BAD DREAM.

1479
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

1480
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
>> YOU'RE A LOCAL.

1481
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
YOU WENT TO SCHOOL HERE.

1482
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
YOU GREW UP HERE.

1483
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
>> I GREW UP IN NEWTOWN.

1484
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
>> SO DOES IT MAKE IT EASIER FOR

1485
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
YOU IN SOME WAYS BECAUSE THESE

1486
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
ARE YOUR PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE

1487
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
COUNSELING, OR IS IT HARDER

1488
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR TOWN AND

1489
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED

1490
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
HERE?
>> I THINK, IN A WAY, IT HELPS

1491
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE, BUT

1492
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S DIFFICULT

1493
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
BECAUSE YOU'RE EXPERIENCING THE

1494
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
SAME THING THEY'RE GOING

1495
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
THROUGH, AND YOU NEED IT JUST AS

1496
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
BAD AS THE OTHER PERSON THAT

1497
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
YOU'RE COUNSELING BECAUSE IT'S A

1498
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
SHOCK FOR YOU AS WELL.

1499
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
>> WHAT KINDS OF QUESTIONS ARE

1500
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
THE YOUNG PEOPLE ASKING YOU?

1501
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
WHAT'S THE THING THAT THEY WANT

1502
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
TO KNOW?
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE, A LOT OF

1503
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG KIDS, LIKE

1504
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
ESPECIALLY ON FRIDAY AND THIS

1505
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
WEEKEND, THEY DON'T KNOW.

1506
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
THEY'RE HEARING ALL THE

1507
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
INFORMATION FROM THEIR PARENTS.

1508
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
THEY'RE HEARING ALL THE

1509
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
INFORMATION FROM THE NEWS, AND

1510
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT STORIES,

1511
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
AND A LOT OF KIDS JUST WANT TO

1512
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED OR IF -- OR

1513
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
WHAT'S -- BASICALLY, WHAT'S

1514
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
GOING ON BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY

1515
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
DON'T WANT TO TELL -- SOME OF

1516
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
THE CHILDREN ARE VERY YOUNG.

1517
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL A

1519
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
HAPPENED.

1520
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
AND PEOPLE JUST SAY IT WAS BAD

1521
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
GUYS, OR THEY'RE GOING TO TELL

1522
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
THEM ONCE THEY'RE A LITTLE MORE

1523
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
READY.

1524
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
>> HOW DO YOU FIND IS THE BEST

1525
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THESE

1526
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
CHILDREN?

1527
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
>> I DON'T WANT TO MUDDY IT, BUT

1528
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I DON'T WANT TO TELL THEM

1529
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE, "A,"

1530
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
TOO SHOCKING OR, "B," DON'T

1531
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF IT.

1532
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM VERY --

1533
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
NOT -- I'M A MIDDLE

1534
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
GROUND.
>> RIGHT, THERE'S A MIDDLE

1535
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
GROUND.
YOU CAN'T GIVE THEM THE EXPLICIT

1536
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
DETAILS.
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM SOMETHING

1537

01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
WITH GUNS IN A TERRIBLE WAY FROM

1806
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
SORT OF YOUR HOMETOWN TO WHAT

1807
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
YOU EXPERIENCED IN AURORA,

1808
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
COLORADO.
I WANT TO START BY PLAYING A

1809
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
LITTLE BIT OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT

1810
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
SAID IN THE VIGIL FROM LAST

1811
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
NIGHT.

1812
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
LISTEN.
>> IN THE COMING WEEKS, I'LL USE

1813
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE HOLDS

1814
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
TO ENGAGE MY FELLOW CITIZENS

1815
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, TO MENTAL

1816
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, TO PARENTS

1817
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
AND EDUCATORS, IN AN EFFORT

1818
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
AIMED AT PREVENTING MORE

1819
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS.

1820
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
>> HE SAID LAW ENFORCEMENT,

1821
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS,

1822
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
PARENTS -- ALL OF THEM NEED TO

1823
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
COME TOGETHER TO DO SOMETHING.

1824
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
HAVE YOU BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN

1825
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE SO

1826
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
FAR?

1827
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
>> CERTAINLY.

1828
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
WE HAVE BASICALLY HEARD THE SAME

1829
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
MESSAGE AFTER AURORA, AFTER

1830
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
TUCSON, AND THOSE WORDS WEREN'T

1831
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
FOLLOWED BY ANY ACTION.

1832
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I MEAN, HE SPOKE MORE FORCEFULLY

1833
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,000
LAST NIGHT, BUT IT REMAINS TO BE

1834
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
SEEN IF ANYTHING WILL ACTUALLY

1835
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
COME OF THOSE WORDS.

1836
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
>> WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE?

1837
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
IF YOU COULD WRITE LEGISLATION

1838
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
AND GET IT PASSED TOMORROW, WHAT

1839
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
WOULD IT INCLUDE?

1840
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
>> THE EASIEST WAY TO START

1841
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF DEATHS BY

1842
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY IS BY JUST

1843
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
REQUIRING A BACKGROUND CHECK FOR

1844
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
EVERY GUN SALE.

1845
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
CURRENTLY, 40% OF GUNS SOLD IN

1846
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
THIS COUNTRY UNDER FEDERAL LAW

1847
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
AREN'T SUBJECT TO A BACKGROUND

1848
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
CHECK.

1849
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT

1850
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
HIGH CAP MAGAZINES, ASSAULT

1851
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
WEAPONS, BUT IF YOU WANT TO

1852
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
REDUCE THE 34 AMERICANS MURDERED

1853
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
WITH GUNS EVERY SINGLE DAY,

1854
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE THE

1855
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
EASIEST WAY TO DO THAT AND THE

1856
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
SIMPLEST WAY TO DO THAT.

1857
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
>> "THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS

1858
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
REPORTING THAT, AFTER THE

1859
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
SHOOTING IN AURORA, THAT WAS

1860
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
SOMETHING THAT WAS DISCUSSED.

1861
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DID PUT

1862
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
TOGETHER A LIST OF THINGS THAT

1863
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
COULD BE DONE.

1864
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
IT WAS JUST NEVER BROUGHT UP OR

1865
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
PRESENTED AS SOMETHING TO ENACT.

1866
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
IS THAT FRUSTRATING TO YOU?

1867
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
>> DEFINITELY.

1868
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER

1869
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
IT'S A MEASURE THAT ENJOYS WIDE

1870
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
SUPPORT IN THE PUBLIC, EVEN

1871
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
AMONG NRA GUN OWNERS.

1872
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
>> IT WOULD NOT HAVE HELPED IN

1873
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
THIS CASE, THOUGH.

1874
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
WE KNOW THAT THESE GUNS IN THIS

1875
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
PARTICULAR CASE, IN THIS

1876
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
TRAGEDY, WHICH IS WHAT HAS

1877
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
REALLY, I THINK, KIND OF GRABBED

1878
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
PEOPLE'S ATTENTION FINALLY, IF

1879
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
YOU WILL, THAT WOULD NOT HAVE

1880
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
MADE A DIFFERENCE.
>> AND THAT'S THE UNFORTUNATE

1881
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
REALITY OF HAVING GUNS IN A FREE

1882
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
SOCIETY IS THAT WE CAN'T STOP

1883
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
ALL VIOLENT ACTS.

1884
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
BUT THERE ARE SOME PRETTY EASY

1885
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
MEASURES THAT ARE AGREED UPON BY

1886
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
MANY PEOPLE, SUCH AS HAVING

1887
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
BACKGROUND CHECKS.

1888
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
AND THAT, I THINK, IS A STARTING

1889
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
POINT.

1890
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
AND THEN BEYOND THAT, WE CAN

1891
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
HAVE DISCUSSIONS.
THAT TO ME IS THE BEST WAY TO DO

1892
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
THIS.
>> STEVEN BARTON, THANK YOU FOR

1893
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
TALKING WITH US THIS MORNING.

1894
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
WE APPRECIATE IT.

1895
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
WE SAW A LOT FROM THE MAYORS

1896
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
AGAINST ILLEGAL GUNS.

1897
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
THEY'VE REALLY BEEN LEVERAGING

1898
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
OFF THIS ISSUE TO MAKE THEIR

1899
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
POSITION KNOWN AND MAYBE GET
SOME TRACTION FOR THEIR ISSUES.

1900
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
WANT TO GET RIGHT BACK TO

1901
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
ZORAIDA SAMBOLIN.

1902
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
SHE'S BEEN COVERING THE DETAILS

1903
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
OF THE VICTIMS, AS JOHN'S BEEN

1904
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
MENTIONING ALL MORNING, WE

1905
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
REALLY WANTED TO FOCUS ON THOSE

1906
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
WHO LOST THEIR LIVES AND NOT ON

1907
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
THE NAME OF THE SHOOTER, THE

1908
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
KILLER.
LET'S GET RIGHT TO ZORAIDA.

1909
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
>> Reporter: IT'S BEEN REALLY

1910
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
GREAT TO BE ABLE TO KNOW THESE

1911
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
KIDS A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND

1912
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
SOME OF THE ADULTS ALSO WHO LOST

1913
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
THEIR LIVES.

1914
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I WANT TO MENTION WHERE I'M AT.

1915
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I'M AT TREADWELL PARK, AND THIS

1916
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
IS WHERE MOST OF THE PRESS

1917
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
CONFERENCES ARE TAKING PLACE.

1918
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
WE KNOW THAT STATE POLICE, WE'RE

1919
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
EXPECTING TO HEAR FROM THEM

1920
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
SOMEWHERE AROUND 9:00 OR 9:30

1921
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
EASTERN.
YOU CAN SEE IT'S LIGHT OUT NOW.

1922
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
IT'S A SOCCER FIELD.

1923
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER HOW

1924
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
MANY OF THESE LITTLE VICTIMS AND

1925
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
THEIR FAMILIES SPENT TIME

1926
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
PLAYING IN THIS VERY PARK WHERE

1927
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
WE ARE NOW.

1928
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
WE ARE REMEMBERING 7-YEAR-OLD

1929
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
GRACE McDONNELL.

1930
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
LITTLE GRACE McDONNELL.

1931
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
SHE LOVED DRESS UP JEWELRY.

1932
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
SHE LOVED GYMNASTICS AND SOCCER.

1933
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
EMILIE PARKER, AGE 6.

1934
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
HER FATHER SAID SHE COULD LIGHT

1935
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
UP A ROOM.

1936
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
SHE WAS A MENTOR TO HER TWO

1937
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
YOUNGER SISTERS, AGES 3 AND 4.

1938
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
6-YEAR-OLD JACK PINTO, AN AVID

1939
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
WRESTLER WITH THE NEWTOWN YOUTH

1940
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
WRESTLING ASSOCIATION AND A BIG

1941
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
NEW YORK GIANTS FAN.

1942
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
HIS FUNERAL IS BEING HELD TODAY.

1943
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
NOAH POZNER, HE'S ALSO 6 YEARS

1944
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
OLD.

1945
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
HIS AUNT SAYS HE HAD A HUGE

1946
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
HEART AND WAS SO MUCH FUN.

1947
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
A BIT RAMBUNCTIOUS WITH LOTS OF

1948
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
SPIRIT.
HE WAS REALLY THE LIGHT OF A

1949
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
ROOM.
HE WILL ALSO BE LAID TO REST

1950
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
TODAY.

1951
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
THEN THERE IS 6-YEAR-OLD

1952
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
CAROLINE PREVIDI.

1953
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
HER EFFORTS TO MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH

1954
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
EARNED HER THE NICKNAME SILLY

1955
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
CAROLINE.

1956
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
AND THEN THERE'S 30-YEAR-OLD

1957
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
LAUREN ROUSSEAU, A SUBSTITUTE

1958
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
TEACHER AT SANDY HOOK

1959
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
ELEMENTARY.
HER MOTHER SAID LAUREN WANTED TO

1960
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
BE A TEACHER BEFORE SHE EVEN

1961
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
WENT TO KINDERGARTEN.

1962
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
LATER THIS MORNING, WE'LL BRING

1963
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
YOU MORE PROFILES OF THE NEWTOWN

1964
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING VICTIMS.

1965
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
IT'S SO NICE TO BE ABLE TO GET

1966
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
TO KNOW THEM A BIT, JOHN AND

1967
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
SOLEDAD.
>> WE SO APPRECIATE YOU DOING A

1968
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
NICE REMEMBRANCE OF THE LITTLE

1969
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
BIT THAT WE KNOW.

1970
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
SOME OF THESE VICTIMS, 6 AND

1971
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
7-YEAR-OLDS, IT IS.

1972
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
IT'S NICE AS WE GET TO HEAR MORE

1973
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
ABOUT THE CHILDREN AND LESS

1974
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
ABOUT THE SHOOTER IN THIS CASE.

1975
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
>> SHE SAID ONE OF THE KIDS

1976
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
EARNED THE RIPS AND THE TEARS IN

1977
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
HIS JEANS.

1978
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I JUST LOVE THAT IMAGERY.

1979
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
>> AHEAD THIS MORNING, WE'RE

1980
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT A CNN

1981
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
EXCLUSIVE HONORING DAWN

1982
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
HOCHSPRUNG.

1983
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000

THE CHANCE

NSAIDS, INCLUDING CELEBREX,

2033

So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

2254

This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

2255
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
It's not real.

2256
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

2257

This computer-animated

COURSE, IS ON THE VICTIMS TODAY,

BUT WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT

2396
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
THE GUNMAN THIS MORNING.

2397
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
A RELATIVE SAYS THAT HE WAS

2398
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:57,000
PULLED OUT OF SCHOOL, OUT OF THE

2399
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
NEWTOWN SCHOOL SYSTEM BY HIS

2400
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
MOTHER, WHO WAS SOMEHOW UNHAPPY

2401
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
WITH THEIR PLANS FOR HER

2402
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
TROUBLED SON.

2403
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
AND SHE DECIDED TO HOME SCHOOL

2404
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
HIM INSTEAD, SOME YEARS AGO

2405
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
OBVIOUSLY.

2406
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, MOURNS THE

2407
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
LOSS OF 27 OF THEIR OWN.

2408
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE

2409
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
SHOOTER AND WHAT DROVE HIM TO

2410
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
COMMIT SUCH UNSPEAKABLE ACTS.

2411
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
IT DOES CONTINUE.

2412
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
>> GAMES GARABIONO IS A

2413
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR AT LOYOLA

2414
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
LAW SCHOOL AND ALSO THE AUTHOR

2415
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
OF "LOST BOYS," HOW OUR SONS

2416
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
TURN VIOLENT AND HOW YOU CAN

2417
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
SAVE THEM.
YOU LOOK BACK AT WHO DOES THESE

2418
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
KINDS OF MASS MURDERS, USUALLY

2419
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
THEY'RE YOUNG, THEY'RE MEN,

2420
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
THEY'RE SUBURBAN.

2421
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU TELL US THAT'S

2422
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
A THREAD AMONG THOSE WHO

2423
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
PERPETRATE THESE CRIMES?

2424
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:51,000
>> AFTER THE FACT, IT SEEMS MUCH

2425
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
CLEARER THAN BEFORE IT ACTUALLY

2426
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
HAPPENED.
THESE YOUNG MEN, THESE BOYS ARE

2427
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
BUILDING A TOWER OF BLOCKS.

2428
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
EACH BLOCK CONTRIBUTES TO THEM

2429
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
GETTING TO THIS POINT.

2430
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
IT'S NOT THE RESULT OF ANY ONE

2431
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
BLOCK, BUT USUALLY

2432
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
TEMPERAMENTALLY THEY'RE
PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE, A LITTLE

2433
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
BIT ODD.
THEY EXPERIENCE SOCIAL

2434
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
REJECTION.

2435
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,000
THEY EXPERIENCE ISOLATION.

2436
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
BUT ALSO THEY PREPARE FOR THIS.

2437
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
THEY PLAY VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES

2438
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
THAT GET THEM READY

2439
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
PSYCHOLOGICALLY, EVEN

2440
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
TECHNICALLY.
THEN THEY GET FIXATED ON THIS

2441
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
DELUSION, THIS IDEA, THAT

2442
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
SOMEHOW THIS GRANDIOSE ACT OF

2443
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
VIOLENCE WILL MAKE THEIR LIVES

2444
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
RESOLVED, THAT IT WILL DEAL WITH

2445
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
THEIR PROFOUND SADNESS, IT WILL

2446
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
GIVE BACK TO THE WORLD SOMETHING

2447
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
THAT THEY FEEL HAS BEEN DONE TO

2448
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,000
THEM.

2449
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FROM THE

2450
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
OUTSIDE, BUT INSIDE, ALL OF THE

2451
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
KILLERS, INSIDE THIS MAKES SENSE

2452
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
TO THEM.

2453
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
WHEN THEY ACTUALLY COMMIT THE

2454
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
ACT, THEY MAY COME TO THEIR

2455
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
SENSES AND BECOME LUCID, WHICH

2456
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
IS ONE REASON WHY THEY OFTEN

2457
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
KILL THEMSELVES.
>> CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE VIDEO

2458
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
GAMES?
YOU BROUGHT THIS UP BECAUSE IN

2459
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
THESE DISCUSSIONS WE INVARIABLY

2460
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
GET TO THIS NOTION OF VIOLENT

2461
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
VIDEO GAMES.

2462
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
IN YOUR RESEARCH, IN YOUR TALKS

2463
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
WITH THESE KIDS, WHAT KIND OF

2464
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:07,000
ROLE HAVE YOU SEEN THAT THEY
PLAY?

2465
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
>> THEY PRETTY CLEARLY BREAK

2466
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
DOWN IMPEDIMENTS TO KILLING.

2467
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
MOST PEOPLE HAVE A SORT OF

2468
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
BARRIER, BUT THE VIDEO GAME, AND

2469
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
MILITARY PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE

2470
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
FOUND THIS, WHEN YOU HAVE THE

2471
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
POINT AND SHOOT VIDEO GAME, IT

2472
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
BREAKS DOWN THAT INHIBITION

2473
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
AGAINST KILLING AND PROVIDES A

2474
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
PRACTICE.
AND I THINK FOR SOME OF THESE

2475
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
KIDS, IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY'RE

2476
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
LIVING OUT THESE VIOLENT VIDEO

2477
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
GAMES WHEN THEY COMMIT THE ACT.

2478
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
OF COURSE, THAT BY ITSELF IS NOT

2479
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
SUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE THIS.

2480
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
MANY OF THESE OTHER THINGS HAVE

2481
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
TO BE PRESENT, INCLUDE ACCESS TO

2482
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
REAL WEAPONS.

2483
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
NO SOCIETY THAT MAKES

2484
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES AVAILABLE

2485
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
SHOULD BE SURPRISED WHEN PEOPLE

2486
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
ACT OUT THESE DELUSIONAL

2487
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
SCENARIOS IN THIS VIOLENT WAY

2488
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
BECAUSE MOST OF THE VIDEO GAMES,

2489
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
THAT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF

2490
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,000
WEAPON THEY PRACTICE ON.

2491
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:57,000
>> THE FAMILY OF DYLAN KLEBOLD

2492
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
FROM COLUMBINE GRANTED YOU THE

2493
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
ONLY INTERVIEW.

2494
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW IF WHAT THEY

2495
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
TOLD YOU PROVIDES ANY INSIGHT

2496
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
INTO WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

2497
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
GRANTED, WE DON'T KNOW A LOT

2498
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
ABOUT THE SHOOTER.

2499
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
WE KNOW ALMOST LESS, IF YOU

2500
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
WILL, ABOUT HIS MOTHER, WHO HE

2501
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
WAS LIVING WITH, AND WHO ALSO

2502
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
WAS A VICTIM AND A GUN

2503
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
COLLECTOR.

2504
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
DO YOU SEE ANY KIND OF THREAD OR

2505
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
INFORMATION FROM THE OTHER CASE

2506
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
IN COLUMBINE THAT WOULD PROVIDE

2507
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
SOME INSIGHT IN THIS CASE?

2508
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
>> WELL, IT'S HARD TO SAY MUCH

2509
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
TO RESPECT THEIR PRIVACY AND

2510
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
CONFIDENTIALITY, BUT I HAVE

2511
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
SPOKEN WITH OTHER KIDS WHO

2512
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
DIDN'T COMMIT THIS BUT ON THE

2513
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
VERGE OF DOING IT.

2514
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
A BOY WHO BROUGHT GUNS AND BOMBS

2515
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
TO SCHOOL INTENT UPON ONE OF

2516
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
THESE KINDS OF ACTIONS, AND I

2517
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
THINK THAT, IF THERE IS A COMMON

2518
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
THREAD, IT'S THAT THE PARENTS

2519
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
ARE NOT NECESSARILY OBLIVIOUS TO

2520
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
WHAT'S GOING ON, BUT THEY DON'T

2521
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
QUITE UNDERSTAND THE FULL

2522
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
DIMENSIONS OF IT.

2523
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
THESE ARE CHILDREN OFTEN WHO

2524
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
HAVE BEEN A LITTLE ODD OR A

2525
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
LITTLE UNUSUAL SINCE THEY WERE

2526
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
VERY YOUNG, AND PARENTS LOVE

2527
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
THEM.
OF COURSE, THESE ARE PARENTS WHO

2528
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
TYPICALLY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

2529
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
SORT OF KEEP THEIR CHILDREN

2530
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
AFLOAT THROUGH CHILDHOOD AND

2531
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
INTO ADOLESCENCE.

2532
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
A BOY LIKE THIS WHO GREW UP IN

2533
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
AN INNER CITY, POOR NEIGHBORHOOD

2534
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
WOULD PROBABLY SORT OF BREAK

2535
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
DOWN BY THE TIME HE WAS IN

2536
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

2537
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
BUT THESE KIDS ARE KEPT AFLOAT,

2538
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
AND IT GIVES THEM AN OPPORTUNITY

2539
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,000
AS TEENAGERS TO DEVELOP THESE

2540
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
DELUSIONAL IDEAS TO GET FIXATED

2541
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
ON THEM, TO PRACTICE WITH THE

2542
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
VIDEO GAMES, AND THEN TO FIND

2543
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,000
ACCESS TO THESE WEAPONS.

2544
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
SO THE COMMON ELEMENT IS THAT

2545
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
THEY'RE ACTING OUT AN AMERICAN

2546
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
SCENARIO THAT IS PROMOTED TO

2547
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
THEM THROUGH THE MOVIES, THROUGH

2548
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
VIDEO GAMES, THROUGH THE

2549
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
CULTURE.

2550
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
I SPOKE WITH ONE BOY WHO HAD

2551
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
STUDIED THE COLUMBINE MASSACRE

2552
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
AS A SORT OF PRIMER ON HOW TO GO

2553
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:44,000
ABOUT DOING THIS.

2554
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:49,000
>> I'M REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT

2555
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
SOMETHING YOU SAID THERE.

2556
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
YOU SAID YOU TALKED TO BOYS WHO

2557
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,000
WERE ON THE VERGE OF DOING THIS

2558
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
CRIME.

2559
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
HOW DO YOU GET THEM NOT TO GO TO

2560
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
THAT AWFUL PLACE?

2561
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
>> ONE OF THESE BOYS ACTUALLY

2562
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
WENT TO SCHOOL, AND A COUPLE OF

2563
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
TEENAGE GIRLS NOTICED HE SEEMED

2564
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
A LITTLE OFF THAT DAY.

2565
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
THEY CALLED THE CAMPUS POLICE

2566
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
OFFICER.
HE INTERVENED.

2567
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
WHAT THE BOY SAID WAS HE DIDN'T

2568
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
WANT TO KILL THESE GIRLS.

2569
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
SO HE SURRENDERED RATHER THAN GO

2570
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
FORWARD.

2571
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
HE ALSO SAID SOMETHING VERY

2572
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
INTERESTING, WHICH WAS HE DIDN'T

2573
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
HAVE THE SOCIAL SUPPORT OF

2574
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
SOMEBODY ELSE SORT OF PUSHING

2575
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
HIM FORWARD IN THIS, WHICH, OF

2576
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
COURSE, THE BOYS IN COLUMBINE

2577
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
HAD.
THEY HAD EACH OTHER.

2578
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
HE EVEN SAID THAT.

2579
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
HE SAID, THEY HAD EACH OTHER.

2580
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TO GO

2581
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
FORWARD.

2582
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
NOW, THIS BOY WHO DID THIS, THIS

2583
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
TERRIBLE THING IN CONNECTICUT,

2584
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
WE DON'T KNOW, WE MAY NEVER

2585
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
KNOW.

2586
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
THE FACT THAT HE KILLED HIS

2587
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
MOTHER SUGGESTS THAT HE HAD SOME

2588
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
SORT OF RAGE THAT WAS PART OF

2589
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
THIS FIXATION AND THAT HIS

2590
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
MOTHER WAS SOMEHOW TIED UP IN

2591
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,000
THIS IDEA THAT HE HAD, THAT HE

2592
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
HAD TO PAY BACK AGAINST THE

2593
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
WORLD IN A WAY THAT, IF HE WERE

2594
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
ALIVE TODAY, EVEN HE MIGHT SEE

2595
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
HOW CRAZY THAT SEEMS.

2596
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,000
>> JAMES GARABINO, THANKS SO

2597
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
MUCH FOR THE INSIGHT ON THIS.

2598
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
I FIND THE COMMONALITY THREAD

2599
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
AND THE WORK YOU'VE DONE REALLY,

2600
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
REALLY FASCINATING AND

2601
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
TERRIFYING AT THE SAME TIME.
I WANT TO GET RIGHT BACK TO

2602
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
ZORAIDA SAMBOLIN.

2603
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
SHE'S BEEN LOOKING MORE AT THE

2604
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
VICTIMS IN THIS CASE, TO GIVE US

2605
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
INSIGHT INTO THEIR LIVES, THEIR

2606
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
SHORT LIVES IN SOME CASES.

2607
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
ZORAIDA?
>> Reporter: I'M ACTUALLY AT

2608
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
TREADWELL PARK.
THIS IS WHERE MOST OF THE PRESS

2609
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
CONFERENCES TAKE PLACE, AND
WE'RE EXPECTING ONE BY STATE

2610
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
POLICE SOMEWHERE AROUND 9:00 OR

2611
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
9:30 EASTERN, AND WE'RE

2612
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000

OF COURSE, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

2613
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
IT FOR YOU.

2614
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
YES, SOLEDAD, WE ARE REMEMBERING

2615
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000

WE'LL START HERE REMEMBERING

2616
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
JESSICA REKOS THIS MORNING.

2617
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
THE 6-YEAR-OLD LOVED EVERYTHING

2618
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
ABOUT HORSES AND ASKED SANTA FOR

2619

NEW COWGIRL BOOTS AND A COWGIRL

2620
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
HAT.

2621
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
HER FAMILY PROMISED SHE COULD

2622
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
GET HER OWN HORSE WHEN SHE

2623
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
TURNED 10 YARDS OLD.

2624
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
AVIELLE RICHMAN, AGE 6.

2625
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
THIS LITTLE GIRL LOVED TO READ.

2626
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
HER FAVORITE BOOKS WERE THE

2627
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
HARRY POTTER SERIES, AND HER

2628
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
FAVORITE COLOR WAS RED.

2629
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
HER SUMMERTIME HOBBY WAS ARCHERY

2630
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
BECAUSE OF THE MOVIE "BRAVE."

2631
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
LITTLE BENJAMIN WHEELER, ALSO 6

2632
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
YEARS OLD.

2633
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,000
HIS RABBI SAID, "THERE'S ALWAYS

2634
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
SOME BRAVE INDIVIDUAL WHO GOES

2635
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
UP TO THE DANCE FLOOR TO GET

2636
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
EVERYBODY INVOLVED.

2637
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
THAT WAS BEN WHEELER."

2638
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
6-YEAR-OLD ALLISON WYATT.

2639
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000

ALLISON LOVED TO GARDEN WITH HER

2642
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
MOM AND WAS ALWAYS OUTSIDE IN

2643
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
THE SUMMER.

2644

01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
ANIMALS, PHOTOGRAPHY, AND HER

2650
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,000

SHE ENJOYED GARDENING, READING,

2656
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
AND GOING TO THE THEATER.

2657
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
THEN THERE'S 27-YEAR-OLD FIRST

2658
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
GRADE TEACHER VICTORIA SOTO.

2659
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
THE OLDEST OF FOUR CHILDREN, SHE

2660
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000

YANKEES.

2664
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
SOTO SPENT HER FINAL MOMENTS

2665
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
SHIELDING HER STUDENTS FROM

2666
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
HARM, HIDING THEM IN A CLOSET

2667
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
BEFORE THE GUNMAN ENTERED HER

2668
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
CLASSROOM.
AND HER MOTHER SAYS THAT DOES

2669
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:11,000
NOT SURPRISE HER ONE BIT.

2670
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
>> SHE WAS TRULY SELFLESS.

2671
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
SHE WOULD NOT HESITATE TO THINK

2672
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
TO SAVE ANYONE ELSE BEFORE

2673
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
HERSELF AND ESPECIALLY CHILDREN.

2674
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
SHE LOVED THEM MORE THAN LIFE,

2675
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
AND SHE WOULD DEFINITELY PUT

2676
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
HERSELF IN FRONT OF THEM ANY

2677
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
DAY, ANY DAY AND FOR ANY REASON.

2678
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ANYBODY THAT

2679
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:35,000
KNOWS VICKI THAT SHE DID THIS.

2680
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
>> Reporter: SOTO'S MOTHER SAYS

2681
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
THAT TEACHING IS ALL VICKI EVER

2682
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,000

2693
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
FOR THESE KIDS, BUT ALL OF THESE

2694
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
EDUCATORS IN THAT SCHOOL THAT

2695
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
DAY TREATED THESE CHILDREN LIKE

2696
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
THEY WERE THEIR OWN.

2697
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
IT'S SOMETHING YOU WOULD NEVER

2698
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
EXPECT.

2699
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
YOU CERTAINLY WOULD WANT TO KNOW

2700
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
WHAT HAPPENED FOR YOUR CHILD,

2701
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,000
BUT IT JUST BREAKS YOUR HEART.

2702
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
>> IT HAS BEEN AMAZING, I THINK,

2703
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
THE DEGREE TO WHICH TEACHERS

2704
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
WERE HEROES IN THIS AND ALSO THE

2705
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.

2706
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE SCENE

2707
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
THAT THEY HAD TO WORK IN AND

2708
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
DEAL WITH AND HOW THEY WERE

2709
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
TELLING THOSE CHILDREN AS THEY

2710
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
WERE LEADING THEM OUT, CLOSE

2711
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
YOUR EYES SO YOU WON'T SEE

2712
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
ANYTHING AROUND YOU.

2713
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
THAT'S JUST HORRIFIC.

2714
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
THAT'S HORRIFIC.

2715
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
THANK YOU, ZORAIDA.

2716
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
WE APPRECIATE THAT.

2717
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
>>> STILL AHEAD THIS MORNING ON

2718
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
"STARTING POINT," WE'RE GOING TO

2719
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
GO BACK TO DEEPAK CHOPRA AND

2720
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
TALK ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO GET

2721
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
THROUGH A TRAGEDY LIKE THIS AND

2722
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
FIND ANY INNER PEACE.

2723
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
WHETHER IT'S FOR AN INDIVIDUAL

2724
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000
OR A COMMUNITY.

2725
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
HE'LL BE WITH US IN JUST A BIT.

2726
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
>>> IS IT TIME FINALLY TO

2727
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
TIGHTEN OUR GUN LAWS?
WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO THE

2728
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
DIRECTOR OF MAYORS AGAINST
ILLEGAL GUNS.

2729
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,000
QUESTIONS?

2730
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
ANYONE HAVE OCCASIONAL
CONSTIPATION,

2731
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
DIARRHEA, GAS, BLOATING?

2732
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
YEAH.

2733
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
ONE Phillips' Colon Health
PROBIOTIC CAP EACH DAY

2734
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
HELPS DEFEND
AGAINST THESE DIGESTIVE ISSUES

2735
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
WITH THREE STRAINS

2736
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
APPROVED!

2737
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
[ Female Announcer ]
LIVE THE REGULAR LIFE.

2738
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Phillips'.

2739
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
>>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.

2740
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,000
WE'RE BACK THIS MORNING WITH

2741
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:54,000
DEEPAK CHOPRA.

2742
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
WE'RE LIVE IN NEWTOWN,

2743
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
CONNECTICUT.

2744
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
I KNOW THAT MANY OF THE THINGS

2745
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
WE'VE DISCUSSED OVER THE PAST

2746
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,000
YEARS HAS BEEN ABOUT FINDING AN

2747
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
INNER PEACE, AND I WONDER HOW

2748
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
PEOPLE HERE WILL EVER BE ABLE TO

2749
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
DO THAT.

2750
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
>> IN THE TIME LIKE THIS, IN THE

2751
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
MIDST OF CRISIS, WE WILL

2752
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
NATURALLY TEND TO COME TOGETHER

2753
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER, TO LISTEN

2754
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
TO EACH OTHER, TO PRAY WITH EACH

2755
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
OTHER, TO GRIEVE.

2756
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
THEY GO THROUGH A CYCLE OF

2757
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
DENIAL, ANGER, AND THEN

2758
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
ULTIMATELY THEY DO RECOVER.

2759
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
THAT'S THE INTERESTING THING.

2760
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
IN TWO YEARS MOST PEOPLE WILL

2761
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
HAVE RECOVERED.
>> WHEN YOU SAY RECOVER, WHAT DO

2762
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,000
YOU MEAN BY THAT?

2763
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,000
>> THEY MOVE ON TO A NORMAL OR

2764
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,000
RELATIVELY NORMAL LIFE.

2765
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
SOME WILL NEVER RECOVER.

2766
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
SOME WILL GET POST-TRAUMATIC

2767
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
STRESS DISORDER AND WILL NEED

2768
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,000
ACTUALLY VERY SPECIFIC

2769
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
TREATMENTS FOR THAT.
THE BIGGER QUESTION IS ARE WE

2770
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
GOING TO BE DOING THIS SHOW

2771
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
AGAIN IN THREE MONTHS?

2772
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
UNLESS WE TAKE ACTION.

2773
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
>> ANOTHER TRAGEDY.

2774
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
>> ANOTHER TRAGEDY.

2775
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
>> SO MUCH OF WHAT YOU TALK

2776
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,000
ABOUT -- I'M FASCINATED BY YOUR

2777
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
WRITING AND WHAT WE TALK ABOUT,

2778
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
IS HOW TO BE PRESENT.
TO NOT GET WORKED UP ABOUT THE

2779
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
PAST OR THE FUTURE.

2780
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
HOW CAN YOU BE PRESENT IN A

2781
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS WHEN THE

2782
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
IMMEDIATE PAST IS SO HORRIFYING?

2783
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
>> YOU CAN'T FOR THE MOST PART,

2784
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
BUT YOU SHOULD TRY TO BECAUSE,

2785
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
IF YOU DO, YOU WILL LOOK FOR

2786
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
CREATIVE SOLUTIONS.

2787
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
OTHERWISE, YOU'LL GET CAUGHT UP

2788
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,000
IN THE EMOTIONAL DRAMA OF IT,

2789
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
WHICH IS ALSO VERY MUCH NEEDED

2790
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
ALSO.
UNLESS YOU HAVE THAT ANGER RIGHT

2791
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
NOW, UNLESS YOU HAVE THE RAGE

2792
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,000
RIGHT NOW, WE MIGHT MISS THE

2793
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING

2794
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:33,000
ABOUT IT.
IN FACT, YOU MENTIONED A

2795
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
CAMPAIGN ON TWITTER FOR PEOPLE

2796
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
TO WEAR GREEN AND WHITE.

2797
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
WHY NOT A TWITTER CAMPAIGN FOR

2798
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
ALL OF THOSE WATCHING US TO LOOK

2799
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
AT GUN CONTROL AGAIN.

2800
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
IF THE COLLECTIVE VOICE OF THE

2801
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
PEOPLE SPEAKS RIGHT NOW IN THE

2802
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
MIDST OF THIS CRISIS, SOMETHING

2803
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
WILL HAPPEN.

2804
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
>> I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE

2805
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
WHO ARE WATCHING, NOT HERE IN

2806
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, WHAT DO

2807
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
THEY DO?

2808
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,000
DO YOU GIVE MONEY?

2809
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
IT'S A RELATIVELY AFFLUENT

2810
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
COMMUNITY.
>> YOU HUDDLE TOGETHER.

2811
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
YOU MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE.

2812
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
>> SO YOU SEND MESSAGES?

2813
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
>> YOU SEND MESSAGES.

2814
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
YOU CONGREGATE TOGETHER.

2815
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
YOU GO TO CHURCH TOGETHER.

2816
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,000
YOU PRAY TOGETHER.

2817
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
AND YOU HELP EACH OTHER.

2818
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
THIS MOMENT, THERE'S NOTHING

2819
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
MORE THAN THE COMING TOGETHER OF

2820
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
PEOPLE AND ACTUALLY ALSO GETTING

2821
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
IN TOUCH WITH THEIR GRIEF

2822
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
BECAUSE, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO

2823
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,000
GET IN TOUCH WITH THEIR GRIEF,

2824
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
IT'S ONLY GOING TO FESTER THERE

2825
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
INTO SOME KIND OF ILLNESS.

2826
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
>> DO YOU FIND THAT PEOPLE

2827
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000
RECOVER FASTER WHEN THEY GET

2828
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
INVOLVED IN A PROJECT AROUND AN

2829
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
ISSUE?
FOR EXAMPLE, RAISING MONEY FOR

2830
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
COMMUNITIES THAT NEED MONEY OR

2831
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
FIGHTING FOR GUN LAWS, IF THAT'S

2832
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
HOW THEY'RE SO MOVED?

2833
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
>> THEY DO, BUT THERE'S A TIMING

2834
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
TO IT.
IF YOU IMMEDIATELY GET INVOLVED

2835
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,000
IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU

2836
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,000
ACTUALLY MIGHT BE EVEN IN DENIAL

2837
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
OF THE PAIN THAT YOU'RE FEELING.

2838
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
YOU SHOULD FEEL THE PAIN

2839
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
BECAUSE, IF YOU DON'T FEEL THE

2840
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
PAIN, IT FESTERS.

2841
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
>> YOU BROUGHT UP PAIN.

2842
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Y

2843
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,000
YOU BROUGHT UP RAGE.
YOU BROUGHT UP ANGER.

2844
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
IS IT OKAY TO FEEL ALL THOSE

2845
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,000
THINGS?
>> YES, IT IS.

2846
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,000
AT THIS MOMENT, IT IS.

2847
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:01,000
>> DEEPAK CHOPRA, THANK YOU.

2848
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
THERE ARE MANY GUN ADVOCATES WHO

2849
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
FEEL THIS TRAGEDY COULD HAVE

2850
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
BEEN PREVENTED HAD THE TEACHER

2851
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
INSIDE THE SCHOOL BEEN ARMED?

2852
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:14,000
COULD THAT HAVE HELPED?

2853
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
>>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.

2854
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,000
IN LIGHT OF THIS TRAGEDY IN

2855
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, IS IT TIME

2856
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
TO ADDRESS THE NATION'S GUN

2857
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
LAWS?
>> ONE OF THE PEOPLE SAYING IT

2858
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
MOST LOUDLY IS NEW YORK MAYOR

2859
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG.
>> THIS SHOULD BE HIS NUMBER ONE

2860
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
AGENDA.
HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

2861
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,000
STATES, AND IF HE DOES NOTHING

2862
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
DURING HIS SECOND TERM,

2863
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:07,000
SOMETHING LIKE 48,000 AMERICANS

2864
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
WILL BE KILLED WITH ILLEGAL

2865
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
GUNS.
THAT IS ROUGHLY THE NUMBER OF

2866
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:15,000
AMERICANS KILLED IN THE WHOLE

2867
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
VIETNAM WAR.

2868
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
>> MARK IS THE DIRECTOR OF

2869
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
MAYORS AGAINST ILLEGAL GUNS.

2870
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS

2871
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
RNG MONT

2872
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
MORNING.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

2873
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
>> YOU HEARD MAYOR BLOOMBERG

2874
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
RIGHT THERE.

2875
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS SOMETHING YOU

2876
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT.

2877
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
WHAT IS YOUR NEXT ACTION?

2878
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
>> IT TURNS OUT THERE'S A LOT

2879
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
YOU CAN DO ABOUT NOT JUST MASS

2880
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
SHOOTINGS LIKE THIS THAT ARE

2881
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
TERRIBLE AND IMMEDIATE AND MAKE

2882
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,000
THE HEADLINES, BUT ALSO THE 34

2883
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
AMERICANS THAT ARE KILLED EVERY

2884
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,000
DAY BY GUNS.

2885
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
40% OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS

2886
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
COUNTRY NEVER GET A BACKGROUND

2887
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
CHECK WHEN THEY BUY A GUN.

2888
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
WE FEEL THAT EVERYONE WHO BUYS A

2889
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
GUN SHOULD GET A BACKGROUND

2890
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
CHECK.
THAT'S SOMETHING 40% OF NRA

2891
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
MEMBERS AGREE WITH.

2892
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:02,000
SECONDLY, YOU HAVE TO TAKE A

2893
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
LOOK AT AUTOMATIC HANDGUNS THAT

2894
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
ALLOW PEOPLE TO FIRE A LOT OF

2895
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
AMMUNITION IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF

2896
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,000
TIME WITHOUT RELOADING.

2897
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT A

2898
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
FEDERAL STATUTE THAT IMPOSES

2899
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
REAL PENALTIES FOR STRAW

2900
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
PURCHASING WHERE PEOPLE WHO CAN

2901
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
BUY A GUN BECAUSE THEY HAVE A

2902
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
CLEAN RECORD BUY FOR PEOPLE WHO

2903
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
CAN'T, AND AS A RESULT, LOTS OF

2904
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,000
GUNS END UP IN CRIMINAL HANDS.

2905
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
>> THESE ARE MANY OF THE THINGS

2906
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,000
WE HEAR ABOUT FREQUENTLY AS

2907
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
WE'VE COVERED WAY TOO MANY OF

2908
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
THESE TRAGEDIES.
I GUESS THE QUESTION FOR YOU IS

2909
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
AFTER CHRISTMAS, WHEN IT GETS

2910
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
BACK TO THE NEW YEAR, WHEN THE

2911
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
LEGISLATORS COME BACK, WILL THIS

2912
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
EMOTION STILL BE PALPABLE, AND

2913
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
HOW DO YOU PLAN TO EFFECT THIS

2914
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
CHANGE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN?

2915
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
>> I THINK THIS IS DIFFERENT.

2916
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,000
THERE ARE MOMENTS THAT MOST OF

2917
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
US ARE OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE LIVED

2918
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
THROUGH, AND IT FEELS LIKE

2919
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
SOMETHING CHANGED.

2920
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I KNOW I FELT THAT WAY AFTER THE

2921
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING.

2922
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
EVERYBODY FELT THAT WAY AFTER

2923
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
9/11.
AND ON THE ISSUE OF GUN

2924
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
VIOLENCE, WITH THIS ESCALATING

2925
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
AND RAPIDLY QUICKENING SERIES OF

2926
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
MASS SHOOTINGS, I THINK THE

2927
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
COUNTRY HAS REACHED A POINT

2928
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,000
WHERE IT RECOGNIZES THE SCOPE OF

2929
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
THE PROBLEM.

2930
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,000
AND IS READY, NOT JUST TO MOVE

2931
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
AGAINST THE KIND OF PROBLEMS

2932
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
THAT CAUSE MASS SHOOTINGS LIKE

2933
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
THIS TO DOMINATE THE HEADLINES,

2934
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
BUT TO DEAL WITH THE KINDS OF

2935
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,000
PROBLEMS, ONCE THE CAMERAS

2936
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,000
LEAVE, THAT MURDER 34 PEOPLE

2937
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
EVERY DAY.

2938
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
AND THOSE MURDERS ARE NORMALLY

2939
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
NOT DONE WITH ASSAULT RIFLES.

2940
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
THEY'RE DONE WITH HANDGUNS.

2941
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
AND MORE AND MORE OFTEN, THE

2942
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
KIND OF JUNK HANDGUNS THAT ARE

2943
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
INCREASINGLY POPULAR ON CITY

2944
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
STREETS.
>> I GUESS I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW,

2945
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
IF YOU THINK THAT SOMETHING IS

2946
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:30,000
LIKELY TO HAPPEN.

2947
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
BOTH JOHN AND I, AND I'M SURE

2948
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS TOO,

2949
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,000
BUT THE NRA IS A VERY POWERFUL

2950
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
LOBBY.
THERE'S A REASON THEY GIVE A LOT

2951
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
OF MONEY TO PEOPLE IN CONGRESS,

2952
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS,

2953
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
FRANKLY, WHO SUPPORT WHAT THEY

2954
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
BELIEVE WHO ARE VERY MUCH

2955
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
AGAINST ANY KIND OF STRONG BAN

2956
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
ON WEAPONS.
HOW MUCH OF A FIGHT YOU'RE GOING

2957
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
TO HAVE FROM THE NRA, WHICH IS

2958
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
WELL FUNDED.

2959
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,000
>> TWO POINTS ON THAT, SOLEDAD,

2960
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
AND THE MAYOR MADE ONE OF THEM

2961
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
ON TELEVISION YESTERDAY.

2962
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
ONE OF THEM IS THERE'S A BIG

2963
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,000
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NRA MEMBERS

2964
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
AND WHAT THEY WANT AND THE NRA

2965
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
LOBBYISTS IN WASHINGTON AND WHAT

2966
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
THEY WANT.

2967
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
74% OF NRA MEMBERS THINK

2968
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
EVERYBODY SHOULD GET A
BACKGROUND CHECK.

2969
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT 82% OF GUN

2970
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
OWNERS THINK.

2971
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,000
71% OF NRA MEMBERS THINK THAT,

2972
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
IF YOU'RE ON A TERROR WATCH LIST

2973
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
AND YOU COULDN'T BOARD AN

2974
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
AIRPLANE WITH ME THIS MORNING

2975
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
WHEN I FLEW TO NEW YORK, YOU

2976
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HAVE A GUN.

2977
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
SO THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE

2978
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
BETWEEN WHAT THE RANK AND FILE

2979
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
THINK AND WHAT THE NRA

2980
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
LEADERSHIP THINKS.

2981
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,000
I THINK THE LEADERSHIP IS GOING

2982
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
TO START HEARING FROM THEIR RANK

2983
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
AND FILE THAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT

2984
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
TO BE REPRESENTED.

2985
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
THE SECOND THING IS THE NRA HAS

2986
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
DEVELOPED THIS REPUTATION FOR

2987
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
BEING AN AWESOME POLITICAL FORCE

2988
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
BECAUSE THEY GIVE A LOT OF MONEY

2989
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT

2990
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
CANDIDATES, AND THERE HASN'T

2991
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
BEEN MUCH POLITICAL GIVING ON

2992
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
OUR SIDE OF THIS ISSUE, WHERE WE

2993
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,000
THINK WE SHOULD SUPPORT THE

2994
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
SECOND AMENDMENT, BUT ALSO DO

2995
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
MORE TO PUT GUNS IN THE WRONG

2996
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
HANDS.

2997
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
I THINK THAT IS CHANGING.

2998
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
I THINK WE NEED A LOT MORE

2999
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
PEOPLE TO GET INVOLVED.

3000
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
IF WE LOOK AT THE ELECTORAL

3001
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
HISTORY OF THE NRA, THE NUMBER

3002
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
OF POLITICAL RACES, WHERE

3003
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
THEY'VE HAD A REAL AND

3004
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
DISPOSITIVE INFLUENCE ON THE

3005
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
NRA, IT'S MUCH MORE THAN IT'S

3006
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
CRACKED UP TO BE, AND I THINK

3007
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE GOING TO

3008
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
HAVE TO REALIZE THAT AND START

3009
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
ACTING IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF
THE COUNTRY.

3010
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
>> THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO

3011
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
MIGHT DISPUTE YOUR MATH ON THAT

3012
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,000
ACTUALLY.

3013
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
I THINK THERE ARE PLENTY OF

3014
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:21,000
PEOPLE WHO SAY, NOT DEMONSTRATED

3015
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
ON RACE, I'M NOT SURE EVERYBODY

3016
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
WOULD AGREE WITH YOU.

3017
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,000
MARK GLAZE IS THE DIRECTOR OF

3018
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
MAYORS AGAINST ILLEGAL GUNS.

3019
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO FOLLOW

3020
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,000
YOUR ACTIONS AND SEE WHAT IS

3021
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
DONE AND WHAT TANGIBLE

3022
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,000
DIFFERENCES ARE MADE.

3023
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
AS ONCE AGAIN WE MOVE FROM THIS

3024
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
TRAGEDY TO OTHER TRAGEDIES.

3025
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
THANK YOU, SIR.

3026
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,000
>>> STILL AHEAD THIS MORNING, A

3027
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,000
SPECIAL MOMENT DURING LAST

3028
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,000
NIGHT'S VIGIL AS THE PRESIDENT

3029
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
WAS HONORING THE VICTIMS OF THE

3030
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:49,000
NEWTOWN SHOOTING.
This holiday, Share Everything.

3031
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Share "Not even close."

3032
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Share "You owe me..."

3033
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Share "Just right."

3034
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
The Share Everything Plan.

3035
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Shareable data across 10 devices

3036
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
with unlimited
talk and text.

3037
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Hurry in for a Droid Razr M

3038
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:30,000
by Motorola for $49.99.

3039
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,000
NATURE VALLEY GRANOLA THINS
PACK THE BIG TASTE

3040
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,000
OF GRANOLA AND DARK CHOCOLATE
INTO ONE PERFECT SQUARE,

3041
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
UNDER 100 CALORIES.

3042
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:46,000
NATURE VALLEY GRANOLA THINS.

3043
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
(Announcer) When Subaru owners
look in the mirror,
UNDER 100 CALORIES.

3044
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
they see more than themselves.

3045
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,000
So we celebrate our year-end
with the "share the love" event.

3046
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Get a great deal on a new Subaru

3047
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:03,000
and 250 dollars goes to your
choice of five charities.

3048
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
By the end of this, our fifth
year,

3049
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,000
our total can reach almost 25
million dollars.

3050
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
It's a nice reflection on us
