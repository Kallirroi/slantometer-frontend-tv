POLITICAL BATTLES AND A

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
CACOPHONY OF CRITICISM.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
IN A LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
TODAY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE

UNITED NATIONS SUSAN RICE WROTE,

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
"THE POSITION OF SECRETARY OF

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
STATE SHOULD NEVER BE
POLITICIZED.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I AM SADDENED THAT WE HAVE

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
REACHED THIS POINT EVEN BEFORE

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
YOU HAVE DECIDED WHOM TO
NOMINATE."

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
AND SHE SHARED THE NEWS ON NBC.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
>> I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE A

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
CONFIRMATION PROCESS THAT WAS

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
VERY PROLONGED, VERY

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
POLITICIZED, VERY DISTRACTING

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
AND VERY DISRUPTIVE, BECAUSE

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WE NEED

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
TO GET DONE AS A COUNTRY.

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
>> Reporter: JUST WEEKS AGO,

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
RICE, A TOUGH AND SMART RISING
STAR IN THE OBAMA

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
ADMINISTRATION, WAS THE

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
PRESIDENT'S TOP CHOICE TO SERVE

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
AS THE NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE.

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
BUT SHE DREW A LIGHTNING STORM

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
OF REPUBLICAN CRITICISM FOR

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
REPEATING TALKING POINTS FROM

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THAT

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
SEEMED TO CRITICS TO DOWNPLAY

58
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON THE

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
DIPLOMATIC COMPOUND IN BENGHAZI,
LIBYA.

60
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
>> WHAT THIS BEGAN AS WAS A

61
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
SPONTANEOUS --
>> THE CONCERNS I HAVE ARE

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
GREATER TODAY THAN THEY WERE

63
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
BEFORE AND WE'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
TO GETTING BASIC ANSWERS.

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
>> IT IS CLEAR THAT THE

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
INFORMATION THAT SHE GAVE THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE WAS INCORRECT.

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT, IN A

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
STATEMENT TODAY, PRAISED RICE,

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
WHO WILL STAY AT HER U.N. POST.

70

AND EXPRESSED REGRET FOR "THE

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
UNFAIR AND MISLEADING ATTACKS ON

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
HER."

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
ABC NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT BEFORE
HER WITHDRAWAL, PRESIDENT OBAMA

74
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
HAD CONCLUDED THAT SENATOR JOHN

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
KERRY WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
TO BE THE NATION'S TOP DIPLOMAT.

77
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
WITH KERRY ALMOST CERTAIN TO BE

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
TAPPED, SOURCES SAY FORMER

REPUBLICAN, SEEMS TO TODAY HAVE

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
AN EDGE TO BE THE NEXT DEFENSE
SECRETARY.

82
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
AND IN WHAT IS BEING PERCEIVED
AS AN EXPRESSION OF PRESIDENTIAL

83
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
SUPPORT, PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL

84
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
TOMORROW MEET HERE AT THE WHITE

85
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
HOUSE WITH AMBASSADOR RICE,

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
DIANE.

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
ANOTHER MEETING, THOUGH, NOW,

WITH SPEAKER BOEHNER ABOUT THE
FISCAL CLIFF.

91

WHAT HAPPENED?
>> Reporter: IT WAS DESCRIBED AS

92
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
A FRANK AND CANDID EXCHANGE OF

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
VIEWS WITH HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN

94
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
BOEHNER COMING HERE, INVITED BY

95
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
THE PRESIDENT TO TALK ABOUT THIS

96
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
IMPASSE THEY SEEM TO HAVE

97
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
REACHED, WITH BOEHNER SAYING

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT HASN'T AGREED
TO ENOUGH SPENDING CUTS,

99
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA STILL PUSHING ON
INCREASING TAX RATES ON THE

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS.

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
WE DO NOT HAVE ANY NEWS TO

102
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
SUGGEST THAT ANY DECISION OR

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED.

104
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
BUT AT LEAST THEY'RE STILL

105
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
TALKING, DIANE.

106
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
>> TWO AND A HALF WEEKS AWAY.

107
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH, JAKE.

108
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
>>> AND NOW, WE GO TO SYRIA.

109
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
TINDERBOX TONIGHT AS EVEN ALLIES

110
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000

111
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
SIGNALING THE END MAY BE NEAR

112
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
FOR PRESIDENT ASSAD.

113
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
AND THE POWERFUL HEAD OF NATO IS

114
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
ALSO SIGNALING CHANGE IS COMING.

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
THE END GAME AND WHAT DANGER IT

118
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
POSES FOR THE UNITED STATES.

119
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
>> Reporter: IT COULD ALL END

120
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
SOON HERE IN DAMASCUS.

121
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
WITH THE STARTLING WORD FROM
NATO AND NOW EVEN PRESIDENT

122
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
ASSAD'S STAUNCH ALLY RUSSIA,

123
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
THAT THE BRUTAL DICTATOR'S DAYS
ARE NUMBERED.

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
THAT'S BECAUSE WHILE ASSAD IS

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
STILL IN CONTROL IN THE CAPITAL,

126
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
REBELS ARE MOVING CLOSER.

127
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
NOW, JUST OUTSIDE IN THE

128
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
SUBURBS.

129
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
OUR BBC COLLEAGUE JEREMY BOWEN

130
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
SAW IT FIRST HAND, IN A

131
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE ASSAD'S

132
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
FORCES HAVE TRIED TO STOP THE

133
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
REBEL ADVANCE, POUNDING THE

134
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
BUILDINGS AND HOMES WITH AIR

135
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
STRIKES AND ARTILLERY.

136
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
THE BATTLE IS BLOODY.

137
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
AT THE REGIME'S MILITARY

138
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
HOSPITAL, THERE ARE SAID TO BE

139
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
40 WOUNDED, TREATED A DAY.
WHILE THE REBELS, LIKE THIS

140
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
FIGHTER WHO LOST BOTH FEET,

141
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
RECEIVED TREATMENT FROM A
DENTIST.

142
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
THEIR HOSPITAL, BOMBED.

143
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
>> THE REBELS HAVE SHOWN THAT

144
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
THEY HAVE THE STOMACH FOR A

145
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
FIGHT.

146
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
THEY'VE SHOWN THAT THEY CAN

147
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
ENDURE PAIN.

148
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
AND THEY HAVE THE CONVICTION

149
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
THAT IF THEY DON'T FIGHT ON,
THEY'LL BE KILLED.

150
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
>> Reporter: BOWEN MET SOME 200

151
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
OF THEIR RECRUITS, TRAINING AT

152
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
AN ARMY BASE THEY SAID THEY

153
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
CAPTURED.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN

154
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
TO ASSAD?

155
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
>> KILLED.

156
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
MUST BE KILLED.

157
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
>> Reporter: BUT WHO EXACTLY ARE

158
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
THESE REBELS?

159
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
THE FIGHTER SAYS HIS GROUP IS

160
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
NOT AFFILIATED WITH AL QAEDA.

161
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
BUT WE KNOW OTHER REBELS ARE

162
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
INCLUDING A WING OF AL QAEDA
THAT HAS ATTACKED U.S. SOLDIERS

163
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
IN IRAQ.

164
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
AND WITHIN THE REBEL RANKS,

165
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THERE ARE DOZENS OF COMPETING

166
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
GROUPS WITH DIFFERENT, SOMETIMES
MURKY GOALS.

167
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
>> WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD

168
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
SENSE, TO THE EXTENT THAT

169
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE IN

170
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
THERE AND IN SOME EXTREMIST

171
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
FORM.
THE WORRY IS BOTH THE

172
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
RETRIBUTION AFTERWARDS AND THE
POTENTIAL OF ACCESS TO CHEMICAL

173
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
WEAPONS.

174
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
>> Reporter: A THREAT TO AMERICA
AND THE WORLD.

175
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
AND A THREAT TO THE PEOPLE OF

176
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
SYRIA, LONGING TO BE FREE OF
VIOLENCE.

177
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
OFFICIALS I HAVE SPOKEN TO FEAR
THIS COULD BE A LONG AND BLOODY

178
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
CONFLICT, EVEN IF ASSAD FALLS.

179
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
ALTHOUGH SOME STILL HOLD OUT

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
HOPE THAT A POLITICAL SOLUTION
CAN BE FOUND, IF ASSAD FINALLY

181
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
REALIZES HIS DAYS ARE NUMBERED,

182
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
DIANE.

THEIR REAL SECRET IS SIMPLY

722
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
DOING WHAT THEY LOVE.

723

SENTENCE.

UP.

787

I HAVE TO SAY, IT WAS A

788
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
DIFFICULT FIRE BECAUSE THERE WAS

789
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
SO MUCH HEAVY SMOKE AND A LOT OF

790
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
FLAMES AND THEY COULDN'T GET

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
INSIDE THAT BUILDING.

792
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
SO THEY HAD TO ATTACK IT OR HIT

793
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
IT FROM ABOVE.

794
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
NOW, THE ROOF EVENTUALLY

MORE TOXIC.
