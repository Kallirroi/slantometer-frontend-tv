1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
FAMILY AND MY WIFE AND MY

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
DAUGHTERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF AND

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
THAT IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
CAN DO TO HELP ANYBODY AT ANY

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
TIME, ANYWHERE, I'D BE WILLING

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
TO DO THAT.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT HAPPENED

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO SO MANY

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN INTO

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US, BUT

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US TO BE

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
BETTER, TO BE MORE COMPASSIONATE

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
AND MORE HUMBLE PEOPLE.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
>> A FATHER, A FAMILY, A

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
>> A NATION, WEARY OF THESE

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
TYPES OF TRAGEDIES, HOW DO WE

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
STOP THIS FROM COLLECTIVELY

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
HAPPENING AGAIN?

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS TO

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
PONDER.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'M DON LEMON, LIVE IN NEWTOWN,

OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000

THEY'RE ALSO AT THE HOME OF THE

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
IDENTIFIED SHOOTER, TRYING TO

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
LEARN ANY CLUES, WHATEVER THEY

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
CAN, WHY HE DID WHAT HE DID, IN

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
PARTICULAR.

38

SIX ADULTS, ALSO TALKING TO

THESE YOUNG VICTIMS TONIGHT.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
THE 12 LITTLE GIRLS, EIGHT BOYS

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
SHOT IN THE CLASSROOMS.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
MOST OF WHAT WE ARE LEARNING IS

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
FROM THEIR PARENTS, PUBLICLY

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
SHARING THEIR GRIEF.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
YOU WERE THERE EARLIER WHEN THE

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
FATHER OF EMILIE PARKER CAME OUT

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
OF HIS HOUSE AND WANTED TO TELL

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
PEOPLE.
WANTED TO TALK TO TV CAMERAS,

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
AND JUST TALK IN A VERY HUMAN

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
WAY ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER, ABOUT

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
WHAT SHE WAS LIKE.

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
ABOUT THE LIFE SHE LIVED.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
>> Reporter: AND HE WAS VERY

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
CLEAR WHAT THE REASON HE WANTED

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
TO COME OUT AND FACE CAMERAS,

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
YOU KNOW, HE KNOWS THIS IS

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
NATIONAL TELEVISION.
HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY KNEW

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
THAT HE WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU.

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
AND HE ALSO WANTED TO SHARE A

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
MESSAGE THAT WE'RE BETTER THAN

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
THIS.

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
THAT SOCIETY CANNOT BE DEFINED

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
BY THIS SINGLE ACT.

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
HE LOST A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
AND IT IS ONE THING TO THINK

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
ABOUT THE NUMBER.

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
IT IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
TO WATCH THIS MAN TALK, TO LOOK

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
AT THE PICTURES OF THIS

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
AND TO FULLY COMPREHEND THAT

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
THIS FAMILY HAS SUFFERED A TRUE,

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
TRUE LOSS.
HERE IS WHAT HE TOLD US.

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
>> I WAS LEAVING TO WORK, AND --

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
SHE WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT.

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
AND I ACTUALLY HAD BEEN TEACHING

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
HER PORTUGESE, SO OUR LAST

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
CONVERSATION WAS IN PORTUGESE.

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING.

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
AND ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
AND I SAID THAT I WAS DOING

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
WELL.
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME.

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
AND I GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
OUT THE DOOR.

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS WE FIND

94
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
COMFORT, REFLECTING ON THE

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
WAS.
AND HOW MANY LIVES THAT SHE WAS

97
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT TIME

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
HERE ON EARTH.

99
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
EM EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE,

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
VERY BRIGHT.

101
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
MY DAUGHTER, EMILIE, WOULD BE

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
THE FIRST ONE TO STAND AND GIVE

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
SUPPORT TO ALL OF THOSE VICTIMS,

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
BECAUSE THAT IS THE TYPE OF

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
PERSON SHE IS.

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
NOT BECAUSE OF ANY PARENTING

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THAT MY WIFE AND I COULD HAVE

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
DONE, BUT BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
GIFTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
HER HEAVENLY FATHER.

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
>> AND HE ALSO SAID THAT HE WAS

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
VERY PROUD TO BE HER FATHER,

113
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE THE BEST

114
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
FATHER HE COULD TO HIS TWO

115
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
REMAINING CHILDREN.

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
A THREE-YEAR-OLD AND A

117
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL, HER SISTERS.

118
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
HE DID ALSO SAY THAT HE WANTED

119
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
TO MAKE SURE THAT HE EXTENDED

120
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
HIS CONDOLENCES TO THE SHOOTER'S

121
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
FAMILY, BECAUSE THEY ALSO

122
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
SUFFERED A LOSS, ANDERSON.

123
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
AND THE THING THAT IS REALLY

124
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
EXTRAORDINARY IS HOW HE IS ABLE

125
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
TO GET HIS MESSAGE OUT AND STILL

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
KEEP IT TOGETHER.

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
IT IS REALLY -- IT IS HARD TO --

128
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
TO WATCH.

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
AND TO COMPREHEND.

130
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
>> AND HOW DOES A FATHER TELL A

131
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
THREE AND A FOUR-YEAR-OLD

132
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
DAUGHTER THAT THEIR SISTER,

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
THEIR BIG SISTER IS GONE?

134
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
SO MANY -- WELL, IT IS JUST

135
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
INCREDIBLE.
APPRECIATE YOU REPORTING

136
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
TONIGHT.

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
RESIDENTS OF STRATFORD,

138
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
CONNECTICUT, REMEMBER ONE VICTIM

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
AS A FALLEN HERO.

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
PEOPLE WORE GREEN IN HONOR OF

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
VICTORIA SOTO WHO GREW UP IN

142
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
STRATFORD.

143
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
SHE WAS TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OLD.

144
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
AND TAUGHT FIRST GRADE AT SANDY

145
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
THEY ARE WEARING HER FAVORITE

147
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
COLOR, GREEN.

148
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH THE

149
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
COMMUNITY REALLY ADORED THAT

150
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
TEACHER AND REALLY WANTED TO

151
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
SHOW THAT IN A VERY PUBLIC WAY.

152
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
>> YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT,

153
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
ANDERSON, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT

154
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
HAPPENED HERE TONIGHT.

155
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
THE FAMILY SAYING THAT IT

156
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
BASICALLY ALL STARTED ON

157
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
FACEBOOK WITH A FACEBOOK

158
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
MESSAGE, LET'S GET TOGETHER.

159
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
LET'S FIND OUT A WAY TO HONOR

160
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
VICTORIA, VICKY, AS HER FAMILY

161
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
AND FRIENDS CALLED HER, VICTORIA

162
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
SOTO.
AND SO THAT IS WHAT THEY DID,

163
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
THEY CAME OUT TONIGHT IN FRONT

164
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
OF HER HIGH SCHOOL.

165
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT HER,

166
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
SAYING SHE WANTED TO BE A

167
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
TEACHER EVER SINCE SHE WAS A
LITTLE GIRL.

168
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
AND THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW
DEDICATED THIS YOUNG WOMAN WAS

169
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
TO HER STUDENTS.

170
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
AND IN FACT, SHE DIDN'T EVEN

171
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
REFER TO THEM AS STUDENTS.

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
SHE ALWAYS REFERRED TO THEM AS

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
HER KIDS.

174
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
AND OUT HERE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,

175
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
WITH HER SISTER BEING HERE, HER

176
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
BROTHER BEING HERE, HER PARENTS

177
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
BEING HERE, HER COUSIN, AS WELL,

178
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
GATHERED TOGETHER.
THEY STRUGGLED TO FIND WAYS TO

179
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
REMEMBER HER.

180
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I SPOKE TO ONE YOUNG WOMAN WHO

181
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
KNEW VICKY SOTO THROUGHOUT HER

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
ENTIRE LIFE.

183
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
LISTEN TO HOW SHE SPOKE ABOUT

184
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
HER TONIGHT.
>> SHE WAS ALWAYS AT THE HOUSE,

185
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
SMILING.

186
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
SHE DROVE US TO CHEERLEADING

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
PRACTICES A COUPLE OF TIMES.

188
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'M ALSO A TEACHER, AND I CAN'T

189
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
EVEN IMAGINE GOING THROUGH WHAT

190
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
SHE WENT THROUGH.

191
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I THINK PUTTING HERSELF OUT

192
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
THERE, SHE IS JUST AN ANGEL, AND

193
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
SHE JUST WENT STRAIGHT INTO

194
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
HEAVEN.
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

195
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
>> Reporter: AS YOU CAN SEE,

196
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
ANDERSON, OBVIOUSLY, IT IS AN

197
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
EMOTIONAL STRUGGLE FOR SO MANY
PEOPLE OUT HERE TONIGHT.

198
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
AT ONE MOMENT, CARLY SOTO, SHE

199
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
IS NINETEEN YEARS OLD, SHE STOOD

200
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
UP IN FRONT OF SEVERAL HUNDRED

201
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
PEOPLE GATHERED OUT HERE

202
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
TONIGHT.
AND SHE SPOKE JUST BRIEFLY, SHE

203
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
REMINDED THE AUDIENCE TO HUG

204
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
YOUR LOVED ONES, SHE SAID,

205
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
BECAUSE YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHEN

206
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THEM AGAIN.

207
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
IT WAS A VERY POWERFUL MOMENT AS

208
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
THE FAMILY PAID TRIBUTE TO A

209
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
WOMAN WHO THEY SAY WAS A

210
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
DEDICATED TEACHER.

211
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
A LOVING DAUGHTER, AND SOMEONE

212
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
WHO LOVED HER CHILDREN OR HER

213
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
STUDENTS.

214
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
ANDERSON?
>> OH, ONE FAMILY SAYS THEY OWE

215
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
THEIR SON'S LIFE TO VICKY SOTO.

216
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
THEY SPOKE TO KATE BALDWIN,

217
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
ABOUT THEIR SON YESTERDAY AND

218
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
HOW HE IS COPING WITH WHAT THEY

219
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
HAVE SEEN.
>> Reporter: ANDERSON, THEY HAD

220
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
TWO CHILDREN AT THE ELEMENTARY

221
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
SCHOOL YESTERDAY.

222
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
A SECOND GRADER AND THEIR SON IN

223
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
FIRST GRADE, WHO THEY SAY IT IS

224
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
A MIRACLE HE MADE IT OUT ALIVE

225
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
AFTER COMING FACE TO FACE WITH

226
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
THE SHOOTER.

227
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
>> AND THAT IS WHEN THEY HEARD

228
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
NOISES THAT HE DESCRIBED AS --

229
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
INITIALLY THEY THOUGHT WERE

230
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
HAMMERS FALLING.

231
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
AND THEN THEY REALIZED THAT IT

232
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
WAS GUNSHOTS.

233
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
AND MS. SOTO, WHO WAS AIDEN'S

234
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
TEACHER, HAD THE PRESENCE OF

235
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
MIND TO MOVE ALL OF THE CHILDREN

236
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
TO A DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE DOOR

237
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROOM, FURTARR

238
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
AWAY FROM THE DOOR.

239
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
AND THAT IS WHEN THE GUNMAN

240
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
BURST IN, DID NOT SAY A WORD, NO

241
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, AND

242
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
PROCEEDED TO SHOOT THEIR

243
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
TEACHER.

244
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
AND THEY BASICALLY RAN RIGHT
NEXT TO THE GUY AND OUT THE

245
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
DOOR.

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
>> THEY RAN PAST THE GUY?

247
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
>> THEY RAN PAST THE GUY.

248
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
HE IS STILL STANDING IN THE

249
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
DOOR.
AND THEY RAN PAST HIM AND DOWN

250
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
THE HALLWAY, NEAR ONE OF THE

251
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
CLOSEST ROOMS TO THE MAIN

252
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
ENTRANCE.
AND AIDEN HAD THE PRESENCE OF

253
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
MIND TO HOLD THE DOOR FOR ONE OF

254
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
HIS CLASSMATES.

255
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
AND THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE OF HIS

256
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
CLASSMATES, A LITTLE BEHIND AND

257
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
WAITED FOR HIM.

258
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
AND THEN THEY ALL RAN TO THE

259
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
MAIN ROAD, ALL THE WAY DOWN.

260
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
>> Reporter: AND OF COURSE WE

261
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
ALL KNOW HIS TEACHER DIED IN

262
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
THAT CLASSROOM TRYING TO PROTECT

263
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
HER STUDENTS.

264
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
>> HE KNOWS HIS TEACHER WAS

265
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
SHOT.
DO YOU THINK HE KNOWS WHAT --

266
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
THAT SHE LIKELY DID NOT MAKE IT?

267
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
>> HE KEEPS ASKING ABOUT HER,

268
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
AND I THINK SHE IS REASSURING

269
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
HIMSELF THAT SHE IS GOING TO BE

270
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
OKAY.
HE REALLY -- REALLY CARED FOR

271
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
HIS TEACHER.

272
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
HE WAS VERY CLOSE WITH HER, AND

273
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
SHE REALLY LOVED HER CLASS.

274
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
AND HE KEEPS SAYING I REALLY

275
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
HOPE SHE IS OKAY.

276
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I HOPE IT IS NOT HER.

277
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
HE KNOWS THAT SHE HAS BEEN HURT.

278
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW THE END

279
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
RESULT.
HE KNOWS THE KIDS THAT HE SAW

280
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
GETTING SHOT.

281
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE OUTCOME.

282
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
SO I THINK HE IS REASSURING

283
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
HIMSELF IN HIS SIX-YEAR-OLD

284
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
MIND.

285
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I KNOW HE IS PROCESSING IT.

286
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
BUT I THINK HE IS REASSURING

287
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
HIMSELF.
I THINK HE IS TELLING HIMSELF

288
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THAT IT IS GOING TO BE OKAY.

289
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
WE HAD TO PUT THE SIGN OUT IN

290
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
THE FRONT TODAY ASKING PEOPLE

291
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
NOT THE RING THE DOOR BELL,

292
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
BECAUSE HE STILL HAS NOT

293
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
INTERNALIZED THE FACT THAT THIS

294
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
GUNMAN, THIS BAD GUY IS GONE.

295
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
AND HE WANTS TO KNOW IF THERE

296
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
ARE MORE BAD GUYS IN THE WORLD.

297
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER

298
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
THAT QUESTION PROPERLY.

299
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
AND SO WHEN SOMEONE RINGS THE

300
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
DOOR BELL HE THINKS IT IS HIM

301
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
COMING BACK -- COMING FOR HIM.

302
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
AND SO HE -- YOU KNOW, HE -- SO

303
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I THINK OUR BIGGEST CONCERN NOW

304
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HANDLE

305
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
HIS SENSITIVE NATURE PROPERLY

306
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
AND CAREFULLY AND SUPPORT HIM.

307
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
AND SUPPORT OUR DAUGHTER,

308
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
BECAUSE SHE AGAIN DOES PROCESS

309
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
THINGS VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN HE

310
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
DOES.

311
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
SO THAT IS OUR JOB AS PARENTS

312
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
NOW, TO STAY CLOSE TO THEM.

313
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
HOLD THEM, HUG THEM, LOVE THEM,

314
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
AND LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE

315
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
SAFE.
>> Reporter: THEY DID NOT WANT

316
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
THEIR CHILDREN TO BE PART OF THE

317
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
INTERVIEW, BUT I DID SPEND TIME

318
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
WITH THEM THIS MORNING.

319
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
AND AIDEN AND HIS SISTER, THEY

320
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
SEEMED IN HIGH SPIRITS, BUT

321
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
CLEARLY SHAKEN.

322
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
AND AS HARD AS IT HAS BEEN FOR

323
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
THIS FAMILY THEY SAY THAT THEIR

324
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
HEARTS GO OUT TO SO MANY OTHER

325
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
FAMILIES WHO CANNOT GO HOME AND

326
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
HUG THEIR CHILDREN TONIGHT.

327
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
ANDERSON?
>> YEAH, KATE, THANK YOU, ONE OF

328
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
THE BUSIEST PLACES IN NEWTOWN,

329
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
CONNECTICUT, MAY HAVE BEEN THE

330
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
GRIEF COUNSELING CENTER.

331
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
BOTH VICTIMS AND THOSE AFFECTED

332
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
BY WHAT HAPPENED FRIDAY GOT THE

333
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
CHANCE TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE IF

334
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
THEY WANTED ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE

335
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
FEELING.
THE HEALING COMES IN HONORING

336
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
THOSE VICTIMS, THE GIANT

337
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
MEMORIAL TO THOSE KIDS.

338
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
JOINING US IS DR. SANJAY GUPTA

339
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
WHO WAS THERE EARLIER.

340
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE PICTURE

341
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
OF THE MAKESHIFT MEMORIALS THAT

342
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
SPRUNG UP.

343
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
AS SO OFTEN SPRINGS UP DURING

344
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
TRAGEDIES.
PEOPLE JUST SPONTANEOUSLY

345
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
EXPRESSING THEIR SORROW AND

346
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
GRIEF, IN WAYS LARGE AND SMALL.

347
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
YOU HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN LOOKING

348
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
AT STUDIES ABOUT HOW KIDS IN

349
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
THIS AGE RANGE, YOUNG KIDS, DEAL

350
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
WITH WITNESSING A TRAUMATIC

351
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
EVENT.

352
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, PTSD IS

353
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
SOMETHING WE THINK ABOUT WITH

354
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
ADULTS.

355
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT WITH

356
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
YOUNG KIDS, CHILDREN, IT EXISTS.

357
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
THEIR BEHAVIOR IS DIFFERENT.

358
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
THEY DON'T HAVE THE FLASHBACKS,

359
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
AND THE HYPER VIGILANCE THAT WE

360
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
ASSOCIATE WITH PTSD.

361
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
SOMETIMES YOU SEE IT IN THE WAY

362
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
THEY PLAY, OR DRESS.

363
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
THEY MAY ACT YOUNGER, THEY MAY

364
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
JUST HAVE BEHAVIOR THAT SEEMS

365
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
OUT OF SORTS.

366
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
AND OFTEN CARE GIVERS DON'T KNOW

367
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.

368
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
AND IT CAN BE A FORM OF PTSD.

369
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
>> AND THE TIME TABLE, DOES IT

370
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
PLAY OUT IMMEDIATELY OR IS IT

371
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
SOMETHING THAT SHOWS UP MONTHS

372
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
LATER?
>> NO, IT OFTEN SHOWS UP VERY

373
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
EARLY.

374
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
AND THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT

375
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
POINT.
BECAUSE IF YOU NOTICE IT EARLY

376
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
THAT IS PRETTY NORMAL FOR BOTH

377
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
ADULTS AND CHILDREN ALIKE.

378
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
IF IT TURNS INTO ANXIETY AND

379
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
NIGHTMARES OR LOSS OF SLEEP,

380
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
THEN THAT IS TIME TO MAYBE GET

381
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
SOME HELP.
AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT LAST

382
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
NIGHT, ANDERSON, AND IF YOU LOOK

383
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
AT THE STUDIES, IT IS REALLY

384
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
COMPELLING STUFF IF SOMEBODY

385
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
GETS GOOD SLEEP.

386
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
GOOD QUALITY SLEEP.

387
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
YOU CAN PREDICT MUCH MORE

388
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
ACCURATELY HOW WELL THEY'RE

389
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
GOING TO BE ABLE TO COPE IN THE

390
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
LONG RUN.

391
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
AND THAT IS SLEEP -- LAST NIGHT,

392
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
TONIGHT, PARENTS WATCHING THEIR

393
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
CHILD'S SLEEP PATTERNS TONIGHT

394
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN

395
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
PREDICTING THAT.

396
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
>> SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT A

397
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, I JUST

398
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
THINK IT BEARS REPEATING.

399
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I THINK IT HAS CONCERNED A LOT

400
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
OF PARENTS, PARENTS WHOSE KIDS

401
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
ARE ON THE SPECTRUM OF AUTISM,

402
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
OR HAS ASPERGERS.

403
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
YESTERDAY THERE WAS A QUOTE FROM

404
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
THE BROTHER WHO SAID HE BELIEVED

405
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
HIS BROTHER HAD A FORM OF

406
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
AUTISM, AND THAT HE ALSO HAD A

407
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

408
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
IT IS EASY TO LINK THOSE TWO

409
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
THINGS TOGETHER.

410
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
AUTISM IS NOT A PERSONALITY

411
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
DISORDER.

412
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
SO LET'S JUST CLARIFY AGAIN.

413
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
>> YES, BECAUSE AS YOU ALWAYS

414
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
SAY, ANDERSON, TERMS DO MATTER

415
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
HERE.

416
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AUTISM

417
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
OR ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM, IS

418
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
WHAT THEY CALL IT.

419
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
IT IS A NEURO-DEVELOPMENTAL

420
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
DISORDER.

421
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS

422
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
FROM BIRTH, OR MAYBE A MENTAL

423
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
ILLNESS THAT COULD COME ON LATER

424
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
IN LIFE.

425
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
BUT THE CRUCIAL POINT HERE, IT

426
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH PLANNED

427
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
VIOLENCE.
IT JUST ISN'T.

428
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
>> I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF A YOUNG

429
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
PERSON WITH AUTISM COMMITTING A

430
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
PRE-PLANNED ACT OF VIOLENCE.

431
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
>> I HADN'T EITHER, BUT TODAY,

432
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT LAST

433
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
NIGHT I WENT AND LOOKED AT THE
STUDIES AGAIN.

434
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
THE STUDY QUOTED WAS OF ABOUT

435
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
132 PEOPLE.

436
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
THAT WAS NOT A BIG STUDY, BUT

437
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
ONE OF THE ONLY ONES OUT THERE.

438
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
AND OUT OF THOSE, ONLY THREE,

439
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
MENTIONS OF VIOLENCE AND NONE OF

440
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
THEM PRE-PLANNED.

441
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
SO I THINK I CAN SAFELY SAY

442
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
THERE IS NO LINK BETWEEN AUTISM

443
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
SPECTRUM AND PRE-PLANNED

444
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
VIOLENCE, SO WE CAN DISPEL THAT.

445
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
>> AND I HAVE HEARD FROM A LOT

446
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
OF PARENTS ON TWITTER AND

447
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
ELSEWHERE, OUTRAGED THAT PEOPLE

448
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
ARE USING THE TERM "AUTISM" AND

449
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
LINKING IT TO THE SHOOTING.

450
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
>> YEAH, I HOPE THEY'RE

451
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
WATCHING.
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS AN

452
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
EDUCATIONAL POINT.
THAT IS JUST NOT TRUE, IT IS

453
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
JUST NOT TRUE.

454
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
>> WHAT SHOULD PARENTS BE

455
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
WATCHING FOR, DO YOU THINK IN

456
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS?

457
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
>> I THINK YOU KNOW, THERE IS A

458
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
LOT OF NORMAL SORT OF GRIEF THAT

459
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
IS GOING ON.

460
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I THINK OBVIOUSLY WITH CHILDREN

461
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
IT IS NOT GOING TO BE SORT OF

462
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
THE THING -- IT IS NOT GOING TO
BE THE THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT

463
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
EXPECT.
ADULTS OBVIOUSLY HAVE A MUCH

464
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
BETTER WAY OF VERBALIZING THESE

465
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
THINGS.

466
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR

467
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
PARENTS TO NOTE.
THIS IS NORMAL IN THE FIRST FEW

468
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
DAYS.

469
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF IT

470
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
PROGRESSES LONGER TERM, THEN

471
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
PEOPLE DO NEED TO GET HELP.

472
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
THERE IS A HELP CENTER AVAILABLE

473
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
HERE, THERE IS NOT ENOUGH SORT

474
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
OF THINKING OF MENTAL ILLNESS OR

475
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
THESE TYPES OF PROBLEMS WITH

476
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
PHYSICAL ILLNESS AS IT IS.

477
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
WE TEND TO PUT THESE THINGS IN

478
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
DIFFERENT BUCKETS.
SO THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD THINK

479
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
OF MENTAL ILLNESS THE SAME WAY

480
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
WE THINK OF CARDIAC ISSUES,

481
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
DIABETES, CANCER.

482
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
IT IS STIGMATIZED, THERE ARE NOT

483
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
ENOUGH RESOURCES, BUT HOPEFULLY

484
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
IT WILL CATCH ON.
>> AND FOR PARENTS WHO HAVE A

485
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
CHILD WITH MENTAL ILLNESS

486
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
ISSUES, WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST

487
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
CASES, WITH THE VIRGINIA TECH

488
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
ISSUE, THE PARENTS TRIED TO GET

489
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
HELP FOR THE CHILD OR FOR THE

490
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
YOUNG ADULT.

491
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
AND UNLESS THAT PERSON CAN BE

492
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
PROVED TO BE VIOLENT OR IS A

493
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
THREAT TO THEMSELVES OR SOMEBODY

494
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
ELSE THEY OFTEN CAN'T GET HELP.

495
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
>> THAT IS RIGHT.

496
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
PARENTS CAN ANGUISH OVER THIS.

497
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
IT IS NOT THAT THEY MISSED THE

498
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
SIGNS, OFTEN THEY KNOW THE SIGNS

499
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
BUT COULDN'T GET HELP.

500
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
AND AT VIRGINIA TECH, THREE

501
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
QUARTERS OF THE STUDENTS HAD

502
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
PTSD, SO THIS CAN LAST A LONG

503
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
TIME.

504
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000

THERE'S NO NEED TO REPEAT IT

REMEMBERS THE NAMES OF MURDERERS

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
CONSTRUCTING A MAP OF ALL OF THE

554
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
PLACES THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD

555
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
CONNECTIONS TO THIS SHOOTER.

556
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
FOR EXAMPLE, HIS BROTHER'S

557
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
APARTMENT DOWN HERE IN NEW

558
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
JERSEY ACROSS NEW YORK UP INTO

559
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
CONNECTICUT.
HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE WHERE SHE WAS

560
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
FOUND DEAD.

561
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
ONLY ABOUT THREE MILES AWAY, OF
COURSE, THE SCHOOL.

562
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT LED

563
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
HIM TO THIS SPOT AT THAT TIME

564
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
BECAUSE THEY DO BELIEVE THAT

565
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
SHORTLY AFTER MURDERING HIS

566
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
MOTHER, HE DID DRIVE THE FEW

567
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
MILES FROM HER HOUSE TO THIS

568
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
SCHOOL AND EMERGE IN THIS

569
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
PARKING LOT WITH WEAPONS VERY

570
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
MUCH LIKE THESE TO GO INTO THE

571
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
SCHOOL.

572
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
NOW, LET'S LOOK AT THE TIME LINE

573
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
OF WHAT HAPPENED.

574
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO
RECONSTRUCT.

575
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
ABOUT 9:30 IN THE MORNING,

576
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
THAT'S WHEN WE BELIEVE BASED ON

577
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS AND POLICE

578
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
RADIO, THAT HE PROBABLY LEFT HIS

579
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
CAR, WE THINK THIS IS THE ONE

580
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
OVER HERE, BASED ON THE

581
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
INVESTIGATION, AND CAME UP TO
THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL.

582
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
IT'S ALSO WHEN HE ENCOUNTERED

583
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
HIS FIRST OBSTACLE.

584
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
BECAUSE THESE SECURITY DOORS
WERE INSTALLED TO KEEP PEOPLE

585
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
OUT.

586
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
POLICE LATER SAID THE GLASS HAD

587
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
BEEN BROKEN OUT OF THESE.

588
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
THAT'S APPARENTLY HOW HE GOT

589
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
INTO THE SCHOOL WITH THOSE
WEAPONS.

590
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS BASED

591
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
ON POLICE REPORTS, BY 9:36, WE

592
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
HAD OUR FIRST CALLS INTO THE

593
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
POLICE STATION SAYING THAT

594
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
SHOOTING WAS OCCURRING INSIDE

595
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
THE SCHOOL AND, OF COURSE,

596
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
EVERYBODY WITHIN THE SCHOOL WAS

597
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
ALERTED TO THE SOUND OF THE

598
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
GUNFIRE.

599
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
IF THEY DIDN'T HEAR IT DIRECTLY,

600
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
THEY HEARD IT OVER THE P.A.

601
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
SYSTEM IN THIS SCHOOL WHERE

602
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE BEING MADE AT

603
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
THAT TIME.

604
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
EVEN THOUGH ALL OF THE SHOOTING

605
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
TOOK PLACE IN A RELATIVELY SMALL

606
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
AREA UP HERE.

607
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
THIS IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT, BY

608
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
9:38, 2 TO 2 1/2 MINUTES LATER,

609
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
POLICE WERE SAYING IF NOT ALL

610
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
THE SHOOTING, A BULK OF THE
SHOOTING WAS OVER, A VERY SHORT

611
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
PERIOD OF TIME IN A VERY SMALL

612
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
AREA WHERE IT ALL SEEMED TO

613
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
OCCUR.

614
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?

615
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
WELL, IT PROGRESSED EVEN

616
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
FURTHER.

617
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
BY ABOUT 9:40 IN THE MORNING,

618
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
POLICE WERE CALLING FOR

619
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIANS TO

620
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
COME THERE, FOR AMBULANCES TO
COME.

621
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
A FEW MINUTES LATER, THEY CALLED
FOR A WHOLE LOT MORE AMBULANCES

622
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
TO COME.

623
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
AND BY 9:50 OR SO IN THE

624
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
MORNING, THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY

625
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
SAYING THE SCENE WAS SECURE.

626
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
THEY HAD A SUSPECT WHO WAS DOWN.

627
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
THEY HAD CLEARED THE BUILDING.

628
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
THAT MANY OF THE CHILDREN WERE

629
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
BEING LED OUT, AS YOU CAN SEE IN

630
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
THIS PHOTOGRAPH FROM "THE

631
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
NEWTOWN BEE."

632
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
AND THAT THE SITUATION WAS MORE
OR LESS SECURE.

633
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
THERE IS STILL A LOT OF WORK TO

634
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
BE DONE OBVIOUSLY.

635
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, AS WE LOOK

636
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
AT THIS TIME LINE CLOSER AND

637
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
CLOSER, IT'S COMING DOWN TO A

638
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, 20

639
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
MINUTES OR LESS FROM THE

640
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
BEGINNING TO THE END OF THIS IN

641
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
TERMS OF PEOPLE REALLY KNOWING
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

642
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
AND NOW THIS HUGE, LONG, LONG
SEARCH TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT

643
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
HAPPENED.
ANDERSON?

644
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
>> TOM, THANKS VERY MUCH.

645
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
WE WANT TO GO TO OUR DAVID

646
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
ARIOSTO WHO'S IN THE

647
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE MOTHER OF

648
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
THIS SHOOTER LIVED.

649
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
DAVID, WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING

650
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
ABOUT THIS LADY?

651
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
>> ANDERSON, THIS IS WHERE THAT
FIRST MURDER TOOK PLACE BEFORE

652
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
THE SHOOTER HEADED OVER TO THAT

653
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
WE'VE TALKED TO NEIGHBORS IN AND

654
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
AROUND THE AREA HERE.

655
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
THEY PAINT A PICTURE OF A WOMAN
WHO WAS KILLED RIGHT BEFORE THAT

656
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
SHOOTING -- THEY DESCRIBE HER

657
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
SORT OF AS THIS PLEASURABLE

658
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
WOMAN, A WOMAN WHO WAS A VERY
PLEASANT PERSON TO BE AROUND.

659
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
SOMEONE WHO LOVED GARDENING,

660
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
LOVED LANDSCAPING, SOMEONE WHO

661
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
ATTENDED A MONTHLY DICE GAME
WITH MANY PEOPLE IN THE

662
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.

663
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
IT'S A TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY IN

664
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
THIS SOUTHWESTERN CONNECTICUT

665
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
TOWN.

666
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T REALLY

667
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
GET A SENSE OF IT NOW, IT IS ONE

668
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
OF THE MORE PICTURESQUE PLACES

669
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'M STANDING IN.

670
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
ROLLING GREEN HILLS AND QUITE AN

671
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOOD, TWO AND
THREE-STORY HOMES.

672
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
THE THINKING IS PEOPLE MOVED TO

673
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
THIS AREA BECAUSE OF THE SCHOOL
SYSTEMS.

674
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
SO IT STRIKES A PARTICULAR CHORD

675
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
THAT THIS OCCURRED WITHIN AN
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

676
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
BUT THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THAT

677
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
OTHER SIDE, THE TALK OF THIS

678
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
WOMAN, NANCY LANZA, WHO

679
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
COLLECTED GUNS, SOME

680
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
HIGH-POWERED WEAPONS AS IN THAT
BUSHMASTER THAT WAS USED IN THE

681
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING.

682
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER SHE

683
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
ATTENDED SOME OF THE SHOOTING

684
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
RANGES IN THE AREA ALTHOUGH WE

685
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
KNOW THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE

686
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
SHOOTING RANGES WITHIN A 20-MILE

687
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
RANGE OF THIS AREA.

688
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
ONE OF THE WORKERS THAT I SPOKE

689
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
TO AT A LOCAL BUSINESS HERE SAID

690
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
THAT SHE OFTEN SHOWED HER

691
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
RIFLE -- SHOWED A RIFLE THAT SHE

692
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
HAD RECENTLY PURCHASE AND EVEN

693
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
BROUGHT HER CHILDREN TARGET

694
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
SHOOTING.

695
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
NOT CLEAR IF THAT OCCURRED AT

696
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
THOSE RANGES OR JUST IN AND

697
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
AROUND THE AREA.

698
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
ATF AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS WE'VE

699
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
SPOKEN TO, FBI, SAID THAT THAT

700
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
DIDN'T OCCUR.

701
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
THERE'S REALLY QUITE A BIT OF

702
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
CONFLICTING INFORMATION AS TO
WHAT TRANSPIRED HERE.

703
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
BUT ONE NEIGHBOR PERHAPS SORT OF

704
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
SAID IT BEST.

705
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
SOMETHING JUST DOESN'T QUITE ADD

706
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
UP AS TO WHO THIS WOMAN WAS, WHY

707
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
SHE WAS KILLED AND WHAT

708
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
TRANSPIRED IN REALLY THE MINUTES
AFTER HER DEATH.

709
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
>> YEAH, THERE ARE SO MANY

710
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
QUESTIONS STILL UNANSWERED, AT

711
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
THIS POINT

712
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
DAVID, APPRECIATE THE REPORTING.

713
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
WE'LL TAKE A SHORT BREAK.
OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES IN A

714
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
MOMENT.

715
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
CAN YOUR MOISTURIZER DO THAT?

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Employees are being forced to do
more with less.

734
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And the need for capable leaders
is greater than ever.

735
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
When you see these problems do
you take a step back,

736
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
or do you want to dive right in?

737
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
With a degree in business from
Capella University, you'll have

738
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
the knowledge to go further in
your career than you ever
thought possible.

739
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Let's get started at CAPELLA.EDU

740
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
AND LETTING YOU KNOW ABOUT THE

744
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
LIVES THEY LIVED, NOT JUST HOW

745
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
THEY LOST THEIR LIVES BUT THE

746
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
KIND OF LIVES THEY LIVED, WHO

747
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
THEY WERE.

748
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
AND TODAY WE'RE ABLE TO TELL YOU

749
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
MORE ABOUT THEM THAN WE WERE

750
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
YESTERDAY.

751
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
AND NO DOUBT TOMORROW WE'LL BE

752
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
ABLE TO TELL YOU EVEN MORE AS

753
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
FAMILY MEMBERS COME FORWARD AND

754
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
WANT TO SHARE THEIR GRIEF AND

755
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
WANT TO SHARE THEIR MEMORIES OF

756
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
THEIR LOVED ONES.

757
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
THOSE OF US FROM OUTSIDE ARE NOW

758
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE WOMEN
AND THE CHILDREN WHO LOST THEIR

759
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
LIVES ON FRIDAY AT SANDY HOOK

760
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
TAKE A LOOK.

761
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
>> VICTORIA SOTO'S FAMILY SAYS

762
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
SHE HAD HER STUDENTS HUDDLED

763
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
BEHIND HER TRYING TO PROTECT

764
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
THEM WHEN SHE WAS SHOT AND

765
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
KILLED AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

766
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
HER COUSIN SAYS THE HARDEST PART

767
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
WAS WAITING TO HEAR WHETHER SHE

768
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
HAD SURVIVED OR NOT.

769
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
>> AT THAT POINT, IT WAS THE

770
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
HARDEST FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY,

771
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
JUST THE WAITING GAME.

772
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
TO RECEIVE WORD ON WHAT HAPPENED

773
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
TO VICKI'S CLASS.

774
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
>> ALSO KILLED, LAUREN RUSSO,

775
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
HIRED JUST LAST MONTH AS A

776
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
PERMANENT SUBSTITUTE TEACHER.
HER FAMILY SAYS SHE ALWAYS

777
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
WANTED TO BE A TEACHER SINCE

778
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
BEFORE SHE EVEN WENT TO
KINDERGARTEN.

779
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST SAYS ON

780
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
HER WEB PAGE SHE HAS TWO

781
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
DAUGHTERS IN THEIR 20s, MARRIED
31 YEARS.

782
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
AND GOES TO A LAKE HOUSE WITH

783
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
HER HUSBAND, IN UPSTATE NEW YORK

784
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
AND THE PRINCIPAL, DAWN
HOCHSPRUNG SAYING SHE WAS

785
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
EXCITED ABOUT TEACHING.

786
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
>> TO LOSE SOMEBODY LIKE THAT IN
OUR DISTRICT, IT'S SAD.

787
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
>> SHE WAS A PERSONAL FRIEND AND

788
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
A WONDERFUL LEADER.

789
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
>> SHE HAD RECENTLY OVERSEEN THE

790
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
INSTALLATION OF A NEW SECURITY

791
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
SYSTEM REQUIRING EVERY VISITOR

792
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
AFTER 9:30 A.M. TO GET BUZZED IN

793
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
AND SHOW ID.

794
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
>> SHE TRULY DID BELIEVE IN

795
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

796
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
CHILDREN FELT SAFE.

797
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY THE

798
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
TRAGIC IRONY OF THIS ENTIRE
SITUATION.

799
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
>> SHE WAS ALSO A PARENT

800
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
HERSELF, RAISING TWO DAUGHTERS

801
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
AND THREE STEPDAUGHTERS.

802
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
FRIENDS AND PARENTS SAY

803
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
HOCHSPRUNG WAS PASSIONATE AND

804
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
DEDICATED, TOUGH BUT CARING AND

805
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
ONE SAID THE KIDS LOVED HER.

806
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
>> THE PRINCIPAL WHO, GOD BLESS

807
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
HER, LOST HER LIFE, WAS JUST A

808
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
VERY SPECIAL PERSON AND ALL THE

809
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
PARENTS KNEW THAT.

810
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
>> WOLF BLITZER, CNN, NEWTOWN,

811
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
CONNECTICUT.

812
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
>> AT ONE POINT EARLIER TONIGHT,

813
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
A MAN STEPPED FORWARD BEFORE

814
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
CAMERAS TO PAY AN INCREDIBLY

815
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
LOVING TRIBUTE TO HIS OWN

816
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
DAUGHTER, EMILIE PARKER WAS JUST

817
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
6 YEARS OLD.
SHE WAS ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS

818
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
KILLED YESTERDAY.

819
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
HER FATHER, ROBBIE PARKER, SAID

820
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
HE IS EVEN PRAYING FOR THE

821
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
SHOOTER'S FAMILY TONIGHT, WATCH

822
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
>> I'D REALLY LIKE TO OFFER OUR

823
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO THE

824
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
FAMILIES WHO WERE DIRECTLY

825
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
AFFECTED BY THIS SHOOTING.

826
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
IT'S AN HORRIFIC TRAGEDY AND WE

827
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT OUR

828
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
HEARTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO OUT TO
THEM.

829
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
THIS INCLUDES THE FAMILY OF THE

830
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
SHOOTER.

831
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD THIS

832
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
EXPERIENCE MUST BE FOR YOU AND I

833
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUR FAMILY

834
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
AND OUR LOVE AND OUR SUPPORT

835
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
GOES OUT TO YOU AS WELL.

836
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
MY DAUGHTER, EMILIE, WOULD BE

837
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO BE

838
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
STANDING AND GIVING HER LOVE AND

839
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
SUPPORT TO ALL THOSE VICTIMS

840
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF

841
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
PERSON THAT SHE IS, NOT BECAUSE

842
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
OF ANY PARENTING THAT MY WIFE

843
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
AND I COULD HAVE DONE, BUT

844
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE GIFTS

845
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
THAT WERE GIVEN TO HER BY HER
HEAVENLY FATHER.

846
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I HAVE TWO REALLY GOOD FRIENDS

847
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
AT HOME WHO HAVE SET UP A

848
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
FACEBOOK PAGE TO HELP RAISE
MONEY FOR EMILIE.

849
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
WHEN I'VE GOTTEN ON THAT AND

850
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
SEEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

851
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
HAVE COMMENTED AND EXPRESSED

852
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
THEIR CONDOLENCES, IT'S BEEN

853
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
QUITE OVERWHELMING.

854
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
AS THE DEEP PAIN BEGINS TO

855
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
SETTLE INTO OUR HEARTS, WE FIND

856
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
COMFORT REFLECTING ON THE

857
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
INCREDIBLE PERSON THAT EMILIE

858
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
WAS AND HOW MANY LIVES THAT SHE

859
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
WAS ABLE TO TOUCH IN HER SHORT

860
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
TIME HERE ON EARTH.

861
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
EMILIE WAS BRIGHT, CREATIVE AND
VERY LOVING.

862
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
EMILIE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO TRY

863
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
NEW THINGS, OTHER THAN FOOD.

864
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
SHE LOVED TO USE HER TALENTS TO

865
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
TOUCH THE LIVES OF EVERYONE THAT

866
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
SHE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH.

867
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
SHE WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL ARTIST

868
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
AND SHE ALWAYS CARRIED AROUND
HER MARKERS AND PENCILS SO SHE

869
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
NEVER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO

870
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
DRAW A PICTURE OR MAKE A CARD

871
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
FOR THOSE AROUND HER.

872
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF

873
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
TIMES EMILIE NOTICED SOMEONE

874
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
FEELING SAD OR FRUSTRATED AND

875
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
WOULD RUSH TO FIND A PIECE OF

876
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
PAPER TO DRAW THEM A PICTURE OR

877
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
TO WRITE THEM AN ENCOURAGING

878
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
NOTE.

879
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
EMILIE'S CARD MAKING WAS

880
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
EXPRESSED BEAUTIFULLY THIS LAST

881
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
OCTOBER WHEN SHE PLACED A VERY

882
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
SPECIAL CARD SHE HAD MADE INTO

883
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
THE CASKET WITH HER GRANDPA, WHO

884
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
ALSO JUST RECENTLY DIED OF A

885
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
TRAGIC ACCIDENT.

886
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER TWO

887
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
LITTLE SISTERS AND DELIGHTED IN

888
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
TEACHING THEM HOW TO READ, DANCE

889
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
AND FIND THE SIMPLE JOYS IN

890
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
LIFE.

891
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
EMILIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS

892
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE

893
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
PLEASURE TO MEET HER WOULD AGREE
THAT THIS WORLD IS A BETTER

894
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
PLACE BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN IN IT.

895
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
SHE WAS THEIR BEST FRIEND.

896
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
THEY WERE ALL BORN WITHIN THREE

897
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
YEARS OF EACH OTHER SO BY LAW,

898
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE.

899
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
SHE WAS TEACHING MY MIDDLE

900
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
DAUGHTER TO READ.

901
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
SHE WOULD HELP MY YOUNGEST

902
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
DAUGHTER LEARN HOW TO MAKE

903
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
THINGS, SHOW HER HOW TO DO

904
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
CRAFTS.

905
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
THEY LOOKED UP TO HER AND THEY

906
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
LOOKED TO HER WHEN THEY NEEDED
COMFORT.

907
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
USUALLY THAT'S SAVED FOR A MOM

908
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
AND A DAD.

909
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
BUT IT WAS REALLY SWEET TO SEE

910
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
THE TIMES WHEN ONE OF THEM WOULD

911
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
FALL OR GET THEIR FEELINGS HURT,

912
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
HOW THEY WOULD RUN TO EMILIE TO

913
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
GET SUPPORT AND HUGS AND KISSES.

914
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT

915
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
COULD JUST LIGHT UP A ROOM.

916
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING KIND TO
SAY ABOUT ANYBODY.

917
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
AND HER LOVE AND THE STRENGTH

918
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
THAT SHE GAVE US AND THE EXAMPLE

919
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
THAT SHE SHOWED TO US IS

920
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
REMARKABLE.

921
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON.

922
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
AND I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER

923
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
DAD.

924
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I WAS LEAVING TO WORK AND SHE

925
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT.

926
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
AND I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TEACHING

927
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
HER PORTUGUESE.
SO OUR LAST CONVERSATION WAS IN

928
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
PORTUGUESE.

929
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
AND SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING.

930
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
ASKED HOW I WAS DOING.

931
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I SAID THAT I WAS DOING WELL.

932
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME.

933
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT

934
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
THE DOOR.
FREE AGENCY IS GIVEN TO ALL OF

935
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
US TO ACT AND DO WHAT WE WANT.

936
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM
US.

937
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

938
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THAT HE WAS GIVEN AND THAT'S

939
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
WHAT HE CHOSE TO DO WITH IT.

940
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I KNOW THAT GOD CAN'T TAKE THAT

941
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
AWAY.

942
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I'M NOT MAD BECAUSE I HAVE MY

943
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
AGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT I USE

944
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
THIS EVENT TO DO WHAT I CAN TO

945
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
DO WHATEVER I CAN.

946
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY

947
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
FAMILY AND MY WIFE AND MY

948
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
DAUGHTERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF AND

949
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
THAT IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I

950
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
CAN DO TO HELP ANYBODY AT ANY
TIME, ANYWHERE, I'D BE WILLING

951
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
TO DO THAT.

952
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
AS WE MOVE ON FROM WHAT HAPPENED

953
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO SO MANY

954
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN INTO

955
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US, BUT

956
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US TO BE

957
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
BETTER, TO BE MORE COMPASSIONATE

958
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
AND MORE HUMBLE PEOPLE.

959
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
>> A FATHER IN MOURNING SPEAKING

960
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
OF COMPASSION FOR OTHERS.

961
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT SCHOOL IS

962
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
SADLY JUST THE LATEST ON A LONG

963
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
LIST OF VIOLENT ATTACKS WITH
GUNS OVER THE YEARS.

964
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
WHEN WE FIRST HEARD WHAT

965
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
HAPPENED IN CONNECTICUT, PEOPLE

966
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
PROBABLY THOUGHT ABOUT THE OTHER

967
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
DEADLY SHOOTINGS.

968
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
PLACES LIKE VIRGINIA TECH OR
COLUMBINE

969
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
JOINING ME NOW IS PASTOR ROCKY

970
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
VEACH WHO WAS LIVING NEAR

971
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
LITTLETON, COLORADO, WHEN THE
COLUMBINE SITUATION OCCURRED.

972
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
HE NOW LIVES HERE IN CONNECTICUT

973
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY FOR FAMILIES WHO
COME TO YOU AND PEOPLE IN THIS

974
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
COMMUNITY WHO WEREN'T EVEN

975
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
HAVING A LOVED ONE AT THAT

976
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
SCHOOL BUT WHO JUST -- EVERYBODY
FEELS AFFECTED.

977
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

978
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
>> YEAH, AS A CHRISTIAN, WHAT

979
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
CAN YOU SAY TO START WITH?

980
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
BUT AS A CHRISTIAN, YOU TELL

981
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
THEM, THERE'S HOPE IN THE LORD.

982
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
GOD KNOWS WHERE YOU'RE AT.

983
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
GOD CARES FOR YOU AND LOVES YOU.

984
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
RATHER THAN SAYING A LOT ABOUT

985
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
JESUS, TRYING TO BE LIKE JESUS.

986
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
THAT IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO

987
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
>> IT SEEMS, TOO, A LOT OF TIMES

988
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
JUST BEING THERE IS IMPORTANT
AND LISTENING IS AS IMPORTANT AS

989
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
WHAT YOU SAY.

990
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
>> YEAH, VERY MUCH SO.

991
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
THAT'S WHAT ANYBODY NEEDS IN
THIS KIND OF SETTING.

992
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
AND HAVING BEEN IN THIS SETTING

993
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
A TIME BEFORE, AND ACTUALLY I'M

994
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
GLAD TO BE AROUND TO BE ABLE TO

995
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
HELP PEOPLE HERE.
>> YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN THE

996
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME.

997
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
>> YEAH, RIGHT PLACE AT THE

998
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
RIGHT TIME.

999
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
AND THE CHURCH THAT I PASTOR, I
THINK THEY FEEL THAT WAY, TOO.

1000
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
WE'VE BEEN CONDUCTING PRAYER

1001
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
MEETINGS IN THE AREA, PRAYING
FOR PEOPLE.

1002
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
AND GETTING IN TOUCH WITH GOD

1003
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
AND ASKING HIM TO HELP THEM AND
HELP USE US IN WAYS THAT CAN BE

1004
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
HELPFUL TOWARD OTHER PEOPLE.

1005
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
>> IT IS EXTRAORDINARY -- I'VE

1006
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
SPENT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME IN
THIS TOWN.

1007
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
JUST TO SEE HOW PEOPLE ARE

1008
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
COMING TOGETHER.

1009
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
PEOPLE ARE STOPPING HERE, PEOPLE

1010
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
ARE STOPPING DOWN THE STREET AND

1011
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
JUST KIND OF TALKING TO ONE

1012
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
ANOTHER, COMPLETE STRANGERS KIND

1013
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
OF REACHING OUT TO ONE ANOTHER

1014
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
IN GRIEF AND IN SADNESS.

1015
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
>> YEAH, I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1016
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING IN ALL OF

1017
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
US THAT CAN HELP ALLEVIATE THE

1018
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
PAIN WHEN WE GO THROUGH A CRISIS

1019
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
SITUATION.

1020
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
WE NEED EACH OTHER AND THAT'S

1021
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS

1022
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
ABOUT COMMUNITY.

1023
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
>> DO YOU ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO
TALK ABOUT IT?

1024
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I LOST A BROTHER YEARS AGO TO
SUICIDE.

1025
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
AND MY MOM FOUND IT HELPFUL TO

1026
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
TALK ABOUT IT OVER AND OVER

1027
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
AGAIN.

1028
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
AND I FOUND IT VERY, VERY

1029
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
DIFFICULT AND EVEN STILL TO THIS

1030
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
DAY.

1031
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
DO YOU ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TALK?

1032
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
>> I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TALK

1033
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
ABOUT IT.

1034
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
AND I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TALK
TO THE LORD ABOUT IT.

1035
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
SOMETIMES WE FORGET THAT WE CAN

1036
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
TALK TO GOD, TALK TO HIM

1037
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
DIRECTLY.

1038
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
AND HE UNDERSTANDS IN A WAY THAT

1039
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
A PERSON REALLY CAN'T.

1040
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
AGAIN, EVERYTHING I'M ABOUT IS
LOOKING TO HIM.

1041
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
>> THERE ARE NO DOUBT PEOPLE WHO

1042
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
WITNESS WHAT HAPPENED AND

1043
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
QUESTION FAITH, QUESTION HOW CAN
THIS HAPPEN -- HOW CAN THIS BE

1044
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
ALLOWED TO HAPPEN?

1045
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
HOW DO YOU ANSWER?

1046
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
>> THAT'S THE AGE-OLD QUESTION.

1047
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I LOOK AT EVIL -- TO BELIEVE IN

1048
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
EVIL, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN

1049
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
GOOD.

1050
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I GO BACK TO THE STORY OF

1051
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
CREATION.

1052
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
GOD'S THE CREATOR AND THERE IS

1053
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
AN ADVERSARY, THERE IS AN ENEMY.

1054
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
GOD'S NOT THE AUTHOR OF THIS.

1055
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
THE BIBLE SAYS THAT GOD IS THE

1056
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
AUTHOR OF ABUNDANT LIFE.
THE DEVIL IS THE AUTHOR OF THIS

1057
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
KIND OF LIFE.

1058
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
HE COMES TO STEAL, KILL AND

1059
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
DESTROY.

1060
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
IT'S SAD.

1061
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
BUT GOD IS BIGGER THAN THAT.

1062
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
THAT'S WHY WE POINT PEOPLE
TOWARDS HIM IN THIS KIND OF

1063
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
SCENARIO.

1064
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
>> AND FAITH GETS YOU THROUGH?

1065
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
>> FAITH GETS YOU THROUGH.

1066
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I THINK PEOPLE FIND THAT FAITH

1067
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
GETS THEM THROUGH A LOT OF

1068
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT THINK

1069
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
IT WILL AT THE TIME.

1070
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
HAVING LIVED IN COLUMBINE, I SAW

1071
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
THIS ONCE BEFORE -- OR IN DENVER

1072
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
DURING COLUMBINE, SAW THIS ONCE

1073
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
BEFORE.

1074
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
IT'S AMAZING.

1075
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
CHANGED MY LIFE WATCHING HOW

1076
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
OTHER PEOPLE -- HOW GOD DID HELP

1077
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
THEM AND DID GET THEM THROUGH

1078
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
TIMES WHEN THEY THOUGHT THEY
WOULDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH.

1079
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
>> AND TO SEE PARENTS -- TO SEE

1080
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
MR. PARKER SPEAKING ABOUT HIS

1081
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
DAUGHTER, THE STRENGTH THAT

1082
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
TAKES, THE STRENGTH THAT TAKES

1083
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
JUST TO GET THROUGH MINUTE BY

1084
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
MINUTE, SECOND BY SECOND.
>> YEAH.

1085
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
NO, THAT WAS VERY TOUCHING

1086
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
THERE.

1087
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
IT'S JUST A HORRIBLE SCENARIO, A
HORRIBLE SITUATION.

1088
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
LIKE WE SAID IN THE BEGINNING,

1089
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
WORDS CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING

1090
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
IN THIS.

1091
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
HOW CAN I UNDERSTAND HIM?

1092
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000

1267
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
THAT THESE THINGS ARE

1268
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
SPONTANEOUS.
THEY'RE ALMOST NEVER

1269
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
SPONTANEOUS.
SOME OF THE SHOOTINGS WE STUDIED

1270
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
WERE PLANNED OVER A NINE-MONTH
PERIOD.

1271
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
OFTEN WITH THEY THAT NOBODY

1272
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
KNOWS ABOUT WHAT IS COMING, BUT

1273
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
SADLY, THERE ARE QUITE A FEW

1274
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN INKLING

1275
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
IN SOME OF THE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS
WE STUDIED, THERE WERE CHILDREN

1276
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
WHO DIDN'T COME TO SCHOOL THAT

1277
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
DAY BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED
SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN

1278
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
BUT SADLY THEY NEVER TOLD ANYONE

1279
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
WHO COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING.

1280
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
AND SO ONE OF THE

1281
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
COUNTERINTUITIVE THINGS WE

1282
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
LEARNED WAS THAT THERE'S A LOT
OF INFORMATION OFTEN CIRCULATING

1283
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
BUT IT DOESN'T GET TO THE RIGHT

1284
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
PLACE.
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WAS TRUE IN

1285
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE.

1286
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
IT WILL TAKE TIME BEFORE WE KNOW

1287
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
ENOUGH TO GENERALIZE TO IT.
BUT IN THE STUDIES WE STUDIED --

1288
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
AND WE STUDIED ALL OF THEM FROM

1289
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
THE 1970s ONWARD IN THE UNITED

1290
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
STATES, IT WAS FREQUENTLY THE
CASE THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF

1291
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
KNOWLEDGE IN PEER COMMUNITIES

1292
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
THAT DIDN'T GET THROUGH TO THE

1293
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
ADULTS IN TIME TO DO ANYTHING

1294
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
ABOUT IT.

1295
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT IT

1296
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
FREQUENTLY HAPPENS IN TOWNS JUST

1297
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
LIKE NEWTOWN, SMALL, RURAL

1298
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
SETTINGS, NOT THE PLACES THAT WE

1299
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
THINK OF AS CHARACTERISTICALLY

1300
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
VIOLENT.
WE THINK OF BIG CITIES AS PLACES

1301
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
WHERE THERE'S GUN VIOLENCE.

1302
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
AND OF COURSE THERE IS.

1303
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
BUT THESE KINDS OF SHOOTINGS
DON'T HAPPEN IN BIG CITIES.

1304
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
THEY HAPPEN USUALLY IN SMALL

1305
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
TOWNS OR SUBURBS.

1306
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
>> AND IS THERE A COMMON THREAD

1307
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
IN THE MENTAL HEALTH HISTORY OF

1308
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
THE BOYS INVOLVED IN THESE?

1309
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
>> THERE IS ALMOST ALWAYS A

1310
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION.

1311
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
THE SAD THING IS IT'S OFTEN

1312
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
UNRECOGNIZED AND UNTREATED.

1313
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
SO WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL BE
TRUE IN THIS CASE.

1314
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
BUT IN MOST OF THE CASES WE

1315
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
LOOKED AT, THERE WAS

1316
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
AFTER-THE-FACT EVIDENCE OF

1317
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
MENTAL DISORDERS BUT NO

1318
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
TREATMENT.

1319
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
OR HAD EVER BEEN DIAGNOSED

1320
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
THAT'S DISTURBING BECAUSE WE

1321
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
LIKE TO THINK WE CAN RECOGNIZE

1322
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
THE SYMPTOMS.
BUT PARTICULARLY WHEN THE

1323
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
SHOOTERS ARE YOUNGER THAN THIS

1324
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
ONE, THE ONES WE LOOKED AT WERE

1325
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
13, 12, THE SIGNS OF

1326
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
DISTINGUISHED MENTAL ILLNESS

1327
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
THAT ARE GOING TO BE SO VIVID IF
THEY SURVIVE INTO THEIR 20s ARE

1328
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
NOT SO EASY TO DISCERN WHEN

1329
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
THEY'RE 13.

1330
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
SO SADLY THERE IS A -- THERE'S

1331
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
EVIDENCE AFTER THE FACT OFTEN

1332
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
THAT COMES UP IN FORENSIC

1333
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
EXAMINATIONS, BUT NOT THE KIND

1334
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
OF EVIDENCE THAT LEADS TO THE
TREATMENT THAT THEY SO

1335
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
DESPERATELY NEED.

1336
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
>> IT'S ALSO INTERESTING IN THE

1337
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
BOOK TITLE, YOU TALK ABOUT THE

1338
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
SOCIAL ROOTS OF THESE SHOOTINGS.

1339
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
OFTENTIMES THE IDEAS THAT THESE

1340
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
ARE LONERS ON THE FRINGE.

1341
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
BUT YOU'VE FOUND IT'S NOT THAT

1342
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
SIMPLE.
>> NO.

1343
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
SADLY THEY ARE RARELY LONERS.

1344
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
IT'S MORE CHARACTERISTIC TO SAY

1345
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
THEY'RE FAILED JOINERS.

1346
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

1347
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
TYPICALLY TRIED TO JOIN GROUPS

1348
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
AND ARE REBUFFED AND REJECTED.

1349
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
SO THEIR EXPERIENCE IS NOT THAT

1350
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
OF BEING A LONER.

1351
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
IT'S OF BEING PUSHED ASIDE AND
MADE TO FEEL REJECTED.

1352
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
AND SO WHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS

1353
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
WITH THESE YOUNG MEN IS THAT

1354
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
THEY GO THROUGH A WHOLE SERIES

1355
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
OF EFFORTS TO TRY AND GET

1356
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
ATTENTION AND INGRATIATE

1357
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
THEMSELVES IN GROUPS.

1358
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
ALL THOSE EFFORTS FAIL AND THEY

1359
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
START TALKING ABOUT SHOOTING

1360
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
PEOPLE AND SUDDENLY EVERYONE'S

1361
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
PAYING ATTENTION.

1362
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
SO THEY'RE TRYING TO CHANGE HOW

1363
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THEM AND

1364
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
NOTORIOUS AND EVIL SEEMS BETTER

1365
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
TO THEM THAN A LOSER.

1366
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
>> IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I

1367
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
BELIEVE JUST IN NOT TRYING TO

1368
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
MENTION THEIR NAMES BECAUSE JUST

1369
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY CAN

1370
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN GAME FAME

1371
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
OR NOTORIETY BY DOING THIS, I

1372
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
JUST DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD TO
PERPETUATE THAT.

1373
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I KIND YOUR RESEARCH REALLY
FASCINATING.

1374
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I'D LOOV TO TALK TO YOU MORE IN

1375
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
THE DAYS AHEAD.
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.

1376
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
>> MY PLEASURE, ANDERSON.

1377
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
>> SOME MEMORIES ARE SEARED INTO

1378
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
OUR MINDS NO MATTER HOW MUCH ONE
WANTS TO FORGET THEM.

1379
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
THE NEWTOWN SHOOTING NO DOUBT

1380
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY FOR ONE

1381
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
OF THE SCHOOL'S TEACHERS.
YET IN THE MIDST OF A CRISIS,

1382
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
SHE STAYED REMARKABLY CALM FOR

1383
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
HER KINDERGARTEN STUDENTS.

1384
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I TALKED TO HER, JANET VOLLMER
IS HER NAME.

1385
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I WANT YOU TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAID
ABOUT HOW SHE GOT HERSELF

1386
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
THROUGH THIS CRISIS.

1387
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
LISTEN.

1388
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
>> ABOUT 9:30, 9:40, WE HEARD

1389
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
NOISES.

1390
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM WAS

1391
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
STILL ON.

1392
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
SO IT DIDN'T GO OFF.

1393
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
SO YOU COULD HEAR WHAT SOUNDED

1394
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
LIKE POPS, GUNSHOTS.

1395
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
OF COURSE I'M NOT GOING TO TELL

1396
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
THAT TO 5-YEAR-OLDS.

1397
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
SO I SAID TO THEM, WE'RE GOING

1398
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
OVER IN A SAFE AREA AND WE'RE

1399
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
GOING TO -- WE READ A STORY AND

1400
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
WE KEPT THEM CALM.

1401
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
DID A LOCKDOWN DRILL, CLOSED THE

1402
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
DOORS, LOCKED -- COVERED THE

1403
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
WINDOWS.

1404
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
KEPT THE CHILDREN WITH US.

1405
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I HAVE OTHER ADULTS --

1406
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,000
>> I FIND THAT AMAZING THAT

1407
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
FEARING THAT YOU HEAR GUNSHOTS,

1408
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
YOU WERE ABLE TO HAVE THE

1409
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
COMPOSURE TO SIT DOWN AND READ
TO YOUR STUDENTS.

1410
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.

1411
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

1412
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
WITH 5-YEAR-OLDS BECAUSE YOU

1413
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
CAN'T LOSE IT.

1414
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG
TIME.

1415
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
IT'S MY 18th YEAR OF TEACHING.

1416
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
MY JOB WAS TO KEEP THEM SAFE.

1417
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I DIDN'T KNOW -- THERE WAS NO
ANNOUNCEMENT OF WHAT WAS GOING

1418
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
ON.

1419
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
MY INSTINCT WAS IT WASN'T GOOD.

1420
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
SO WE KEPT THEM CALM.

1421
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
WE STAYED IN THE ROOM UNTIL

1422
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
THERE WAS BANGING AT THE DOOR,

1423
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
WHICH WERE THE POLICE AND THE
TROOPERS OR WHOEVER WAS THERE.

1424
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
THEY HAD US EXIT THE BUILDING.

1425
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
THEY TOLD THE CHILDREN TO COVER

1426
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
THEIR EYES AND WALK IN A LINE

1427
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
AND LEAVE THE BUILDING AND

1428
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
THAT'S WHEN WE WENT DOWN TOWARDS

1429
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
THE FIREHOUSE.

1430
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
WE WERE ALL SAFE.

1431
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I HAD 19 CHILDREN IN THE ROOM

1432
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
WITH ME AND THANK GOODNESS ALL

1433
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
OF THEIR PARENTS WERE ABLE TO

1434
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
COME AND PICK THEM UP AND TAKE

1435
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
THEM HOME.

1436
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
>> AS YOU WERE READING TO THEM,

1437
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
DID THE KIDS REALIZE SOMETHING

1438
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
WAS GOING ON OR DID THEY JUST

1439
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
THINK IT WAS A DRILL LIKE YOU'D

1440
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
HAD BEFORE?

1441
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
>> RIGHT.

1442
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
IT DIDN'T SEEM A NATURAL THING.

1443
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
ALTHOUGH WE DO PRACTICE DRILLS.

1444
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
WE JUST SAID, WELL, WE'RE NOT

1445
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
REALLY SURE BUT WE'RE GOING TO

1446
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
BE SAFE BECAUSE WE'RE SITTING
OVER HERE AND WE'RE ALL

1447
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
TOGETHER.

1448
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
AND THAT'S AS WE GOT DOWN TO THE

1449
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
FIREHOUSE LATER ON, AS A LOT OF

1450
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
THE EVENTS STARTED TO UNFOLD

1451
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY, I THINK SOME
OF THEM REALIZED THE MAGNITUDE

1452
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.

1453
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
THEY SAW OTHER PEOPLE UPSET.

1454
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
BUT WE JUST HELD THEM CLOSE

1455
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
UNTIL THEIR PARENTS CAME AND WE
RELEASED THEM.

1456
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
MY ROOM, MY CHILDREN WERE ALL

1457
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
ACCOUNTED FOR AND SAFE IN MY

1458
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM

1459
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
>> WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE

1460
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
KIDS DEALING WITH THE POTENTIAL
FOR PTSD.

1461
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
ALSO FIRST RESPONDERS DEALING

1462
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
WITH THE STRESS IN ALL OF THIS

1463
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
AND WHAT THEY'VE HAD TO SEE.

1464
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
TERRY LYLES DEALS WITH STRESS

1465
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT.

1466
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
HE JOINS ME FROM MIAMI.

1467
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
IT IS EASY TO FORGET THESE

1468
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
SCENES ARE PROBABLY THE WORST

1469
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
MANY OF THESE EMERGENCY WORKERS

1470
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
HAVE EVER WITNESSED.

1471
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE THINGS THEY

1472
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
SAW IN THOSE SCHOOLS -- IN THAT
SCHOOL.

1473
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
YOU HELP RESCUE WORKERS DEAL

1474
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
WITH TRAGEDY FOLLOWING THE

1475
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
SEPTEMBER 11th ATTACKS.

1476
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE?
HOW DO YOU HELP THEM?

1477
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
>> WELL, ANDERSON, THANK YOU FOR

1478
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
HAVING ME.

1479
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I THINK THE BIGGEST THING THAT

1480
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE

1481
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
CLOSEST YOU ARE TO THE

1482
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
EPICENTER, HEARING THE SHOTS,

1483
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
SEEING THE VIOLENCE VISUALLY,

1484
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
THE MORE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO

1485
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
BE ABLE TO DEBRIEF.

1486
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
AS I DEBRIEF SPECIAL FORCES

1487
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
PEOPLE AND SOLDIERS, IT'S VERY

1488
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
IMPORTANT THAT THESE CHILDREN,

1489
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
THEIR PARENTS UNDERSTAND THAT

1490
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
THERE'S LIFE AFTER TRAGEDY BUT

1491
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEIR

1492
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
STORIES, WE HAVE TO HELP THEM

1493
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
VENT AND RELEASE THAT

1494
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN

1495
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
NORMALIZE AND GO BACK TO SOME

1496
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
TYPE OF LIFE AS THEY KNEW IT

1497
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
BEFORE THIS TRAGIC DAY.

1498
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
>> WHAT KIND OF SYMPTOMS DO

1499
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
PARENTS, DO FRIENDS OF PEOPLE

1500
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR?

1501
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
>> WELL, TYPICALLY WITH

1502
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
CHILDREN, IT'S ALL AGE
APPROPRIATENESS.

1503
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
SO IT REALLY DEPENDS.

1504
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
BUT USUALLY SLEEP CAN BE
DISRUPTED.

1505
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
THERE CAN BE NIGHTMARES.

1506
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
THERE COULD BE SUDDEN NOISES

1507
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
THAT COULD STARTLE THEM.

1508
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
MOODINESS THAT YOU'VE NOT SEEN

1509
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
BEFORE, MAYBE A LOSS IN APPETITE

1510
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
OR A LOSS OF INTEREST IN NORMAL

1511
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
THINGS.

1512
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
AND I THINK FOR PARENTS MAINLY,

1513
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
WE'RE ALL JUST MORTIFIED BY THIS

1514
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
EVENT.

1515
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
AND I THINK AS PARENTS WE HAVE

1516
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TALKING

1517
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
TO OUR CHILDREN, REGARDLESS OF

1518
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
WHERE WE ARE IN THE COUNTRY OR

1519
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
AROUND THE WORLD, THAT WE CAN

1520
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
LET OUR CHILDREN KNOW AND
SUPPORT THEM TO SAY, LISTEN,

1521
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
IT'S OKAY, THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN

1522
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

1523
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
THIS WAS NOT A NORMAL SITUATION

1524
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
AND WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THEM AND

1525
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
CARE FOR THEM THAT THEY KNOW

1526
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
THAT THEY'RE SECURED IN A NORMAL

1527
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN.

1528
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
>> BUT TALKING ABOUT IT HELPS?

1529
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
>> WELL, AGAIN, IT DEPENDS ON

1530
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
THE AGE.

1531
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
THE AGES OF THE KIDS THAT YOU

1532
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
MENTIONED, I AGREE WITH YOU.

1533
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

1534
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
BE ABLE TO EVEN NAME THE NAMES

1535
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
AND THE AGES OF THESE CHILDREN.

1536
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
IT'S HEARTBREAKING.

1537
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
AND I THINK WHAT HE CAN DO, AS

1538
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
WE TALK TO OUR CHILDREN, IF

1539
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
CHILDREN CAN DRAW PICTURES AND

1540
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
WRITE LETTERS IF THAT'S WHAT IT

1541
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
GOES, TO FRIENDS THAT THEY LOST

1542
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
OR THE SITUATIONS THEY HEARD AND
DESTROY THOSE LETTERS.

1543
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
WE DESTROY EVERYTHING THAT IS OF

1544
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
WASTE TO US.

1545
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
WE PUT GARBAGE BAGS OUT.

1546
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
WE FLUSH GARBAGE DISPOSALS.

1547
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH THE
EMOTIONAL WASTE.

1548
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
WE HAVE TO HELP THEM VENT AND

1549
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
PROCESS, RELEASE IT AND LET THEM

1550
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
KNOW AS WE TALK TO THEM THAT

1551
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
THEY HAVE A REFUGE WITHIN US AND

1552
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
THAT WE AS PARENTS ARE THERE TO

1553
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
SUPPORT THEM THROUGH THIS

1554
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
SITUATION.

1555
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
>> TERRY LYLES, I APPRECIATE
YOUR EXPERTISE.
