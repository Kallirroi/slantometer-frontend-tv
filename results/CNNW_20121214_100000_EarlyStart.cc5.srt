JESUS [ BLEEP ] CHRIST.

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I COME ON THE NEWS FOR TWO
SECONDS AND YOU WANT TO -- EVERY

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
TIME I DO AN INTERVIEW, A GUY

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
WANTS TO OPEN HIS [ BLEEP ]

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
MOUTH.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
CAN'T YOU [ BLEEP ] A ROUTINE

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
HERE.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
GO [ BLEEP ] YOURSELF, YOU KNOW
WHAT.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
>> OH!

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
OH!

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
YEAH, THAT WAS ANDREW DICE CLAY

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
BEING INTERVIEWED, FOR SOME

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
REASON, ON THE NOW DEFUNCT

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
CNN-FN BY ALLAN CHERNOFF, WHO

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE BEEN

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
BETTER OFF HOLDING A FISH

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
STANDING IN A BOAT.
WE'RE HOLDING OUT FOR SOME

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
MODERATE TO EXTREME

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
>>> OBAMA AND BAOEHNER ARE

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
FACE-TO-FACE.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
THEY TROO TO STAVE OFF THE

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
FISCAL CLIFF.
>> SUSAN RICE OUT OF THE

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
RUNNING.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
THE PRESIDENT'S U.N. AMBASSADOR

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
GIVES UP ON HER HOPES TO BE NEXT

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
SECRETARY OF STATE.
>> AND BULLETS FLY AS THE CAMERA

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
ROLLS.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
VIDEO CAPTURES THE MOMENT SHOTS

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
RING OUT ABOARD A TRAIN.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
GOOD MORNING.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
WELCOME TO "EARLY START" THIS

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
FRIDAY MORNING.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'M CHRISTINE ROMANS.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
>> I'M JOHN BERMAN.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
IT IS 5:00 A.M. IN THE EAST.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
>> WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS THIS

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
MORNING.
IT'S A BIG DEVELOPMENT IN THE

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
FIGHT AGAINST SYRIA AND A NEW

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
LEVEL OF U.S. INVOLVEMENT.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
WE JUST LEARNED WITHIN THE PAST

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
FEW HOURS THE DEFENSE SECRETARY

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
LEON PANETTA SIGNED AN ORDER

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
SENDING TWO PATRIOT MISSILE

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
BATTERIES TO TURKEY.

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
THAT'S TO ASSIST THAT NATION IN

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
DEFENDING AGAINST ANY POLLIBLE

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
MILITARY ACTION BY SYRIA.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
THIS MOVE WAS EXPECTED AS THE

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA DESTABILIZES

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
THE ASSAD REGIME WITH EACH

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
PASSING DAY.
IN ADDITION TO THIS, 400 U.S.

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
TROOPS ARE GOING TO TURKEY.

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
THEY WILL BE DEPLOYED TO OPERATE

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
THE MISSILE BATTERIES.

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
CNN'S NICK PAYTON WALSH HAS THE

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
DEVELOPMENT.

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING.

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
400 PERSONNEL WILL BE

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
ACCOMPANYING THE BATTERIES.

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
LET ME GIVE YOU HISTORY.

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS, WE SAW

62
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
SPORADIC EXCHANGES OF FIRE

63
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
ACROSS THE BORDER.

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
SYRIAN MILITARY FIRING INTO

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
TURKEY CAUSING OFTEN DESTRUCTION

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
AND DEATH.

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
TURKEY OFTEN RESPONDING.
THAT BROUGHT ABOUT THIS REQUEST

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
TO NATO FOR PATRIOT MISSILE

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
BATTERIES.

70
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.

71
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
THIS PARTICULAR TYPE BETTER AT

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
TAKING OUT MISSILES IN THE SKY

73
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
RATHER THAN TAKING DOWN

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
AIRCRAFT.

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
BUT THIS MOVE PART OF A NATO

76
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
RESPONSE.
ALSO SUPPLIED BY GERMANY AND

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
HOLLAND WHOSE PARLIAMENT LAST

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
WEEK APPROVED THEIR

79
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
CONTRIBUTIONS.

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
THE U.S., THOUGH, OF COURSE,

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
PUTTING A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
THE GROUND.

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
MANY OBSERVERS SAYING THAT NOW

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
NATO HAS PHYSICAL TROOPS AND

85
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
PRESENCE IN THE AREA THAT IT

86
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
RISKS SOMEHOW BEING DRAGGED INTO

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
THIS PARTICULAR CONFLICT.

88
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
EVERYBODY IS STRESSING THESE ARE

89
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
PURELY THERE TO DEFEND TURKEY, A

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
STAUNCH NATO MEMBER.

91
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
JOHN?

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
>> THEY STILL COME AS THE U.S.

93
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
OFFERED DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION

94
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
TO THE REBELS IN SYRIA AND WITH

95
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
400 U.S. TROOPS THERE, IT DOES

96
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
GIVE THE U.S. SOME SKIN IN THIS

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
GAME.

98
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY.

99
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I DON'T THINK THE TROOPS WILL BE

100
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
INVOLVED.
SKIN IN THE GAME, CERTAINLY.

101
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THOUGH

102
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
MANY SAY CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO

103
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
DIFFERENT SIDES HERE.

104
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
AT THE SAME TIME, THE DAY BEFORE

105
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THEY GAVE SOME KIND OF LOWER

106
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
LEVEL DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION TO

107
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT.

108
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
THE DAY BEFORE THAT THEY WERE A

109
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
TERROR GROUP, ONE OF THE MORE

110
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
HARD LINE PARTS OF THE REBEL

111
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
FRONT RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY

112
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
VICTORIES, CONSIDERED ISLAMIC

113
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
HARD-LINERS.

114
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
TO MANY DEGREES THEY'RE HEROES

115
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN TAKING OUT

116
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
SO MANY REGIME OUTPOSTS.

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
THE U.S. RESPONSE IN THE PAST,

118
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
48 HOURS.
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COMPLICATED.

119
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
AND NOW AS YOU SAY, SKIN IN THE

120
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
GAME.
>> NICK PEYTON WALSH, WATCHING

121
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
ALL THE DEVELOPMENTS GOING ON.

122
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
THANK YOU.

123
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
>>> AND NOW THE FISCAL CLIFF.

124
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
THERE IS LITTLE PROGRESS AND A

125
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
WHOLE LOT OF FRANK.

126
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
HERE'S WHAT WE MEAN.

127
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
IN 18 DAYS WE GO OVER THE EDGE

128
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
TRIGGERING TAX HIKES AND

129
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
SWEEPING CUTS.

130
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
LAST NIGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA

131
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
CALLED JOHN BOEHNER AND ASKED

132
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
HIM TO MEET AGAIN AT THE WHITE

133
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
HOUSE.
THEY SPENT A LITTLE LESS THAN AN

134
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
HOUR AGO.
WAS IT A GOOD TALK?

135
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
WAS IT A PRODUCTIVE TALK?

136
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
AFTERWARD, BOTH SIDE SAID THEY

137
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
CALLED THEIR DISCUSSION FRANK

138
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
AND SAID THE LINES OF

139
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
COMMUNICATION REMAIN OPEN.

140
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THAT TO BE FRANK DOESN'T SEEM TO

141
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
GET US ANYWHERE CLOSER TO A DEAL

142
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THOUGH.

143
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
DANA BASH JOINS US FROM

144
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
WASHINGTON.

145
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER PLANS TO GO HOME

146
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
TO OHIO TODAY.

147
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.
HE IS ON HIS WAY IF NOT THERE

148
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
ALREADY.
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU TALKED ABOUT

149
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
THE WORD FRANK THAT WAS USED BY

150
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
BOTH PARTIES, BY THE WHITE HOUSE

151
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
AND BY THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE.

152
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
JUST LIKE THEY DID OVER THE

153
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
WEEKEND THEY PUT OUT IDENTICAL

154
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
STATEMENTS, REALLY ONE SENTENCE

155
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
STATEMENTS.

156
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
DIPLOMATIC TERMS, FRANK MEANS

157
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
NOT SO GOOD.

158
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
AND THAT'S THE SAME WORD THAT

159
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
THE SPEAKER USED A COUPLE DAYS

160
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
AGO TO DESCRIBE THEIR MEETING ON

161
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
SUNDAY WHICH WE UNDERSTAND FROM

162
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
SOURCES WAS PRETTY TENSE.

163
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
JUST THE FACT THAT THEY ONLY MET

164
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
FOR 50 MINUTES IS INDICATIVE OF

165
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
THE FACT THAT THE MEETING DIDN'T

166
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
PRODUCE VERY MUCH.
NOW I UNDERSTAND FROM DEMOCRATIC

167
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
SOURCES EARLIER IN THE DAY

168
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
YESTERDAY THAT THEY WERE GOING

169
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
TO TRY TO INVITE THE SPEAKER

170
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
OVER TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO GET

171
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
THINGS MOVING BEFORE HE WENT

172
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
HOME TO OHIO TO PERHAPS PUT A

173
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
FEW OF THE SPENDING CUTS THAT

174
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
THE SPEAKER HAS BEEN DEMANDING

175
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
ON THE TABLE TO TRY TO, YOU

176
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
KNOW, CUT A -- BREAK THIS

177
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
DEADLOCK.
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY GOT VERY

178
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
FAR.
>> WE'VE HAD DEAD LOCKS BEFORE

179
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
IN WASHINGTON AND THEY'VE, YOU

180
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
KNOW, WITH MUCH PAIN BEEN

181
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
RESOLVED.

182
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
YOU TALKED TO TWO FORMER SENATE

183
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
MAJORITY LEADERS FROM OPPOSITE

184
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
SIDES OF THE AISLE ON HOW TO

185
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
MAKE A DEAL.

186
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
WHAT DID THEY SAY?

187

189
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
YOU'RE RIGHT, THESE WERE TWO

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
ART OF DOING SOMETHING REALLY
REALLY TOUGH.

196
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
>> THERE WILL COME A MOMENT WHEN

197
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000

198
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000

210
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
AT LEAST YOU HAVE COMPANY.

211
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000

TO LAWMAKERS ALL DAY LONG EVERY

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
DAY, THERE IS REALLY A LOT OF

215
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
ANGST AND NOT A LOT OF OPTIMISM

216
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THAT THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO GET

217
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000

AND THAT REALLY IS A BIG, BIG

219
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000

KIND OF ATMOSPHERE.

229
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000

IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AND THEN IT

233
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
HAPPENED AND THEN GOT RESOLVED.

234
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000

00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
FISCAL CLIFF ISSUES.
THIS IS HAPPENING INDEPENDENTLY.

732
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
>> IT IS.

733
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
BUT THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO

734
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
CONTINUE THE PAYROLL TAX

735
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000

736
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000

AROUND FROM SOME PEOPLE ON THE

738
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
RIGHT THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO

739
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
RAISE TAXES ON ANYBODY.

740
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
SO THERE'S SOME SOUL SEARCHING

741
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
GOING ON THE PAYROLL TAX CUT AND

742
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
WHETHER THAT WOULD STAY OR GO.

743
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
TWO MONTHS AGO, I WOULD HAVE

744
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
TOLD YOU NO WAY IT COMES BACK.

745
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
NOW, THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IT

746
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000

I'M ON THE EDGE.

Drug and alcohol abuse is up.

762
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And those dealing with grief
don't have access to the

763

01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
>> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION.

1628
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
REALLY ACTUALLY IS STUNNING.

1629
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
WITH REGARD TO THE HOUSE, THEY

1630
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
WERE TOLD THAT THEY SHOULD COME

1631
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
BACK AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE, AND

1632
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
ALSO TOLD -- I WAS INFORMED BY

1633
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
SEVERAL REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS NOT

1634
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
TO MAKE PLANS FOR CHRISTMAS.

1635
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
SO YOU HAVE THIS MEETING

1636
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
YESTERDAY.

1637
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
IT WAS DONE AT THE LAST MINUTE

1638
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
BY THE PRESIDENT TO TRY TO JUMP

1639
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
START THINGS, BUT AS YOU SAID,

1640
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
BOTH SIDES SAID THAT THE MEETING

1641
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
WAS FRANK, WHICH IN WASHINGTON

1642
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
SPEAK, MOSTLY DIP LO SPEAK MEANS

1643
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
IT DIDN'T GO THAT WELL.

1644
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I SPOKE TO A DEMOCRATIC SOURCE

1645
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
WHO SAID THERE WAS NO NEW

1646
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
INFORMATION, NEW NO OFFERS ON

1647
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
THE TABLE.

1648
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
JUST A DISCUSSION OF WHAT EACH

1649
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
SIDE HAS TO DO TO REACH

1650
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
AGREEMENT WHICH IS VERY

1651
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
SURPRISING, GIVEN THE FACT IT'S

1652
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
NOT A SECRET WHAT BOTH SIDES

1653
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
NEED TO DO.

1654
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
REPUBLICANS NEED TO GIVE MORE ON

1655
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
REVENUE.

1656
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
DEMOCRATS NEED TO GIVE MORE ON

1657
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
SPENDING CUTS AND THAT'S WHAT

1658
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
THEY HAVE TO DO.

1659
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
>> YOU OWN A SMALL BUSINESS IN

1660
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
AMERICA, YOU ARE TRYING TO

1661
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
FIGURE OUT HOW YOU WILL DO YOUR

1662
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
PAYROLL IN THE BEGINNING OF THE

1663
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
YEAR, SOFTWARE CHANGES THAT TAKE

1664
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
MORE THAN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

1665
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
FOR SOME, THEY ARE ASSUMING WE

1666
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
ARE GOING OVER THE CLIFF.

1667
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO GET IT

1668
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
TOGETHER IN TIME FOR THE FIRST

1669
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
PAYCHECKS IN JANUARY.

1670
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
YOU TALK TO TWO FORMER SENATE

1671
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
MAJORITY LEADERS FROM OPPOSITE

1672
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
SIDES OF THE AISLE WHO KNOW HOW

1673
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
TO TUESDAYLE AND MAKE A DEAL.

1674
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
TELL US ABOUT THAT.
>> TRENT LOTT, AND TOM DASCHLE,

1675
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
THEY HAVE TUSSLED OVER MANY

1676
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
THINGS.
BALANCED BUDGET IN 1996, WELFARE

1677
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
REFORM, YOU NAME IT.

1678
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
BUT THEY ADMIT THINGS ARE VERY

1679
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
DIFFERENT NOW.

1680
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
POLITICIANS IS A LOT MORE

1681
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
DIVISIVE.
BOTH MEN PREDICT THERE WILL BE A

1682
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
DEAL, JUST A MATTER OF WHEN.

1683
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
>> I FEEL HOPEFUL AT LEAST THAT

1684
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
THEY WILL COME TO AN AGREEMENT.

1685
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
THERE IS AN ARGUMENT YOU DON'T

1686
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
WANT TO MAKE IT TOO EARLY,

1687
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
BECAUSE THAT GIVES PEOPLE THAT

1688
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
MAY NOT BE TOO HAPPY MORE TIME

1689
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
TO UNDERMINE IT.
SO THE TEMPO AND TIMING IS

1690
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
IMPORTANT.

1691
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
>> I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY IN THE

1692
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, REPUBLICANS

1693
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
AND DEMOCRATS, THAT THE TIME HAS

1694
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
COME TO PUT OUR COUNTRY AHEAD OF

1695
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
OUR PARTY AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT

1696
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
IT'S GOING TO TAKE.

1697
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
PUTTING THE COUNTRY AHEAD OF THE

1698
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
PARTY.

1699
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
>> PUTTING THE COUNTRY AHEAD OF

1700
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
THE PARTY, AGAIN, FOR DEMOCRATS

1701
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
THAT MEANS BITING THE BULLET,

1702
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
SAYING, OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO CUT

1703
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
ENTITLEMENT SPENDING.
FOR REPUBLICANS IT MEANS BITING

1704
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
THE BULLET.

1705
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
WHAT PEOPLE ON THE FILL SAY

1706
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
FRANKLY PRIVATELY THEY SAY IT

1707
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
WILL HAPPEN ANYWAY TO GIVE INTO

1708
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
THE PRESIDENT ON THE WEALTH

1709
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
INCREASES, MAYBE NOT UP TO

1710
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,000
PREBUSH ERA PERCENTAGES OF 36%,

1711
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
BUT EVERYBODY HAS A REALLY GOOD

1712
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
IDEA OF WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO

1713
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
COME TO COMPROMISE.

1714
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
A QUESTION OF WHERE THEY ARE ON

1715
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
THE DEADLINE WHAT PEOPLE CAN

1716
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
SWALLOW POLITICALLY.

1717
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
>> I JUST GOT AN E-MAIL FROM A

1718
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
POLITICAL STRATEGIST, WATCHES

1719
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000

01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
INCOMPETENT, DYSFUNCTIONAL,

1721
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
GRIDLOCKED, CONSTIPATED CONGRESS

1722
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000

AND NO CHANCE THAT THE FISCAL

1723
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
CLIFF DEAL CAN BE COMPLETED BY

1724
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
CHRISTMAS.

1725
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000

A MESS.

1731
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
>> IT REALLY IS A MESS.

ALL SIDES DUG IN.

1733
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
AND I LAUGH THERE, BUT IT

1734
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
OBVIOUSLY IS NOT FUNNY IT WOULD

1735
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
BE FUNNY IF IT WASN'T SO

1736
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
SERIOUS.

1737
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
IF IT WAS A MOVIE, YOU WOULDN'T

BELIEVE IT.
>> HA HA, NOT FUNNY.

1739
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
HA HA, JUST UNBELIEVABLE.

1740
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000

HAD A VERY GOOD RECORD AT THE

1986

LOT OF OTHER THINGS AND THEY

1991

FEEL THIS WAS NOT ONLY A

1992
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
DISTRACTION FOR THE PRESIDENT,

1993
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
BUT A DISTRACTION FOR HER WORK

1994

1996
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000

POLITICIZED, VERY DISTRACTING

2002
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
AND VERY DISRUPTIVE.

2003
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS

2004
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000

01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY DOWN THE

2338
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
ROAD, WE'RE GOING TO END UP

2339
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
KICKING THE CAN AS A COUNTRY.

2340
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
>> CAN I ASK YOU, WOULD YOU BE

2341
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
WILLING TO DEAL WITH NEW

2342
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
REVENUE, TAX INCREASES?

2343
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
>> I THINK MOST AMERICANS WOULD.

2344
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I DON'T THINK THEY ARE TOTALLY

2345
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
OPPOSED TO CLOSING LOOPHOLES IF

2346
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
YOU WILL.

2347
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
BOTTOMLINE, IT'S A TAX INCREASE.

2348
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE TOP TWO -- TWO

2349
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
TAX RATES?
>> I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT

2350
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
THAT, YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT

2351
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
INCLUDES A LOT OF SMALL

2352
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
BUSINESSES, IN FACT, THE BULK OF

2353
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH ARE --

2354
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
SMALL BUSINESS IS THE BIGGEST

2355
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
EMPLOYER IN THIS COUNTRY.

2356
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
SO I THINK THAT'S PROBLEMATIC

2357
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
FOR THE ECONOMY.

2358
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
IT'S SELLING WELL FOR THE

2359
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,000
PRESIDENT TO GO AROUND, LET'S

2360
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
GET THE TOP WAGE EARNERS.

2361
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
THOSE ARE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT

2362
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
EMPLOYEE PEOPLE.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

2363
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
REPUBLICAN PARTY IN GENERAL.

2364
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
SENATOR JIM DEMINT TO LEAVE TO

2365
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
GO BECOME HEAD OF THE HERITAGE

2366
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
FOUNDATION.
A LOT OF REPUBLICANS DIDN'T SHED

2367
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
MANY TEARS WHEN HE LEFT.

2368
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
DEMINT A TEA PARTY FAVORITE.

2369
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:53,000
SOME SAY A HARD LIFELINE

2370
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
CONSERVATIVE.

2371
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
IS THERE A DIVISION BETWEEN TEA

2372
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
PARTY MEMBERS AND OTHER

2373
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
REPUBLICANS?
>> THERE WAS CHEERING ON BOTH

2374
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
SIDES.

2375
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
CONSERVATIVES THINK HIM MORE

2376
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
EFFECTIVE AT THE HERITAGE

2377
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
FOUNDATION AND THE ESTABLISHMENT

2378
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
CHEERING, AT LEAST FOR THE SHORT

2379
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
TERM, THAT HE'S OUT OF THEIR

2380
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
HAIR.

2381
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
HE DID CHALLENGE THE

2382
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
ESTABLISHMENT, WHICH IS -- LOOK,

2383
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
YOU LOOK AT THE LAST TWO

2384
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS,

2385
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
REPUBLICANS PUT FORTH MODERATE

2386
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
CANDIDATES, AND THEY LOST.

2387
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:28,000
MODERATES DON

2388
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
MODERAT

2389
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
MODERAT

2390
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
MODERATES, THE GRASSROOTS AND
THE BASE OF THE PARTY, IF THEY

2391
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
ARE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL, THEY

2392
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
HAVE TO RETURN TO THE FOUNDING

2393
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
PRINCIPLES, NOT RETREAT.

2394
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
>> CONSERVATIVES LOSE TOO.

2395
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:45,000
TODD AKIN LOSE, MURDOCH LOSE IN

2396
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
INDIANA.
CONSERVATIVES LOSE TOO.

2397
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
>> NO QUESTION, A BAD CYCLE FOR

2398
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
REPUBLICANS AND YOU MENTIONED

2399
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
TODD AKIN AND RICHARD MURDOCH,

2400
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
WE'RE PREPARED FOR SOME OF THE

2401
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
TOUGH ISSUES AND HOW TO TALK
ABOUT THE ISSUES SUCCESSFULLY.

2402
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
OTHER CANDIDATES HAVE

2403
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
SUCCESSFULLY TALKED ABOUT THEM.

2404
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SOLUTION

2405
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
OF CERTAIN ISSUES.

2406
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
51% OF AMERICANS SUPPORT GAY

2407
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
MARRIAGE, 6 OF 10 YOUNG PEOPLE

2408
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE.

2409
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
BALLOT BOX, THREE STATES

2410
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
APPROVED GAY MARRIAGE, OTHER

2411
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
STATES ALLOW IT.

2412
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
IS THERE AN EVOLUTION IN THIS

2413
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
COUNTRY RIGHT NOW?

2414
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
>> OVER 40 STATES THAT HAVE

2415
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
MARRIAGE DEFINED IN THEIR STATE

2416
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
LAWS AS A UNION BETWEEN A MAN

2417
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
AND A WOMAN.

2418
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
30 HAVE GONE TO AN EFFORT OF

2419
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
PLACING IT INTO THEIR

2420
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
CONSTITUTION.

2421
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
FOUR STATES VOTED ON IT THIS

2422
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
TIME, WHICH TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE

2423
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
DID NOT PREVAIL.

2424
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I HARDLY THINK THAT WHAT WE SAW

2425
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
IN THIS ELECTION IS A -- IS A

2426
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
CONSENSUS, AS SOME HAVE

2427
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
DESCRIBED ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.

2428
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
LOOK, 40 YEARS AGO, AND COMING

2429
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,000
UP NEXT MONTH, WILL BE 40 YEARS

2430
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
OF ROE VERSUS WADE, THOSE UNDER

2431
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
29 HAILED THAT AS A GREAT

2432
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
DECISION BY THE COURT.

2433
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
THAT SAME AGE CATEGORY, 18 TO 29

2434
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
TONIGHT, ARE MORE PRO LEGAL THAN

2435
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
THEIR PARENTS.

2436
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
>> HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE NEWS

2437
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
DEALING WITH UPS BECAUSE OF THE

2438
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
BOY SCOUTS.

2439
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
UPS ARE PULLING THEIR FUNDING

2440
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
FOR THE BOY SCOUTS BECAUSE THEY

2441
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
WILL NOT ALLOW GAY MEMBERS TO

2442
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
HELP RUN THE BOY SCOUTS OR

2443
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
INSIDE THE BOY SCOUTS.

2444
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
WHY DID THE FAMILY RESEARCH

2445
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
COUNCIL DO THIS?

2446
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
>> THE BOY SCOUTS FOR OVER 100

2447
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
YEARS, AS PART OF THEIR MORAL

2448
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
CODE, HAS CHALLENGED BOYS TO BE

2449
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
STRAIGHT AND UPSTANDING

2450
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
CITIZENS.

2451
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
>> STRAIGHT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

2452
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
>> THEIR CODE IS MORLEY

2453
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
STRAIGHT, THEY NOT ENGAGE IN

2454
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
SEXUAL BEHAVIOR THAT THEY KEEP

2455
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
THEMSELVES MORLEY CONDITIONED

2456
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
AND MENTALLY SHARP AND THAT'S

2457
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
THEIR CODE.

2458
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
THEY HAVE HAD THIS POLICY LONG

2459
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
RUNNING FOR GOOD REASON AND TO

2460
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
HAVE AN ORGANIZATION SAY, LOOK,

2461
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
WE WON'T GIVE YOU MONEY UNLESS

2462
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
YOU CHANGE YOUR LONGSTANDING
POLICY TO COME IN LINE WITH OUR

2463
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,000
VALUES.
AND I HAD A CONVERSATION, WE HAD

2464
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH UPS

2465
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
AND SAID, WAIT A MINUTE, WHY ARE

2466
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
YOU DOING THIS?

2467
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
THIS IS A LONG-TERM POLICY THAT

2468
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
THE BOY SCOUTS HAVE HAD.

2469
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
WHY ARE YOU TAKING YOUR MONEY

2470
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
AWAY

2471
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:19,000
WE HAVE A RIGHT TO YOU GIVE

2472
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
MONEY TO THOSE WHO REFLECT OUR

2473
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
VALUES.
>> THE COMPANY ISN'T INTERESTED

2474
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
IN TRUE DIVERSITY BUT IN STRONG

2475
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
ARMING ANYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH

2476
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
THEIR EXTREME AGENDA, INCLUDING

2477
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
A CENTURY OLD YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

2478
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
PROGRAM, WHOSE ONLY CRIME IS

2479
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
INSTILLING CHARACTER INTO

2480
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
MILLIONS OF AMERICAN BOYS.

2481
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
SOME PEOPLE COULD SUGGEST THAT

2482
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,000
NOT ALLOWING GAY MEMBERS, HOW

2483
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
DOES NOT ALLOWING GAY MEMBERS

2484
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
INSTILL CHARACTER INTO BOYS?

2485
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
>> LOOK, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO

2486
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
CHARTERS BOY SCOUT TROOPS,

2487
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
OVER 2/3 ARE CHARTERED BY

2488
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
CHURCHES, THAT'S WHERE THEY HOST

01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
THEIR MEETINGS, THE VALUES THAT

2490
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
RUN PARALLEL TO THE BOY SCOUTS.

WHAT HAVE YOU IS YOU HAVE A FEW

WILL CONTINUE WITH WHAT'S WORKED
