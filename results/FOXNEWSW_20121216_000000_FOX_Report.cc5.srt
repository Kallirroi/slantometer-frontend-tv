00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
NATION WAS MOVED TO TEARS AND

749
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
THE POPE, IT IS SO

750
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
UNFATHOMABLE.
WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO

751
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
THIS PERSON THAT HE WOULD IN

752
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
ANY WAY FEEL THAT HE WAS

753
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
CERTIFIED TO COMMIT THIS

754
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
OBACCEPTITY.

755
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
THIS WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY

756
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
TO BE A DAY THAT WILL LIVE IN

757
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
INFAMY AND THE MAKE OF A

758
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
BEAUTIFUL NEW ENGLAND COMMUN A

759
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
PLACE OF HORROR AND FEAR FOR

760
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
THESE CHILDREN?

761
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I CAN'T, I CAN'T, I SWEAR, IT

762
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
IS THE NATION'S NIGHTMARE,

763
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000

764
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
THEY LED FROM THE MOMENT HE

BURST IN THEIR CLASSROOM AND

766
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
ENDED THEIR LIVES.

767
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
WHAT COULD THOSE CHILDREN HAVE

768
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
BEEN THINKING.

769
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AND YOU

770
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
WANT TO TAKE HIS REMAINS AND

771
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
THROW THEM TO THE WINDS AND SO

772
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
THER NOT THERE. SO EVIL.

773
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
NTHIS HAPPENED IN SOUTHERP

774
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
RUSSIA.
AND THIS HAPPENED IN NORWAY IN

775
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
THE ISLAND A YEAR AGO, AND NOW

776
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
HAPPENED HERE AND WE HAVE HAD

777
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS BEFORE, BUT

778
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
NEVER HITTING A 6 YEAR OLD

779
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
CHILD 11 TIMES WITH A RIFLE.

780
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
NLOOK AT HOW COLUMBINE SCARRED

781
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000

THIS MEMORY?

801
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
IT IS DIFFICULT TO REPORT IN A

802
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
SOBER, SOMBER WAY BECAUSE IT

803
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000

FIGURE THIS OUT AND PARENTS

822
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
TRY TO MAKE A CONNECTION TO

823
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
WHAT HAPPENED HERE AND YOU

824
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000

825
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
LOST IN NEWTOWN.

826
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
MANY ARING AND THINKING OF

827
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
THOSE WHO SURVIVED.

828
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
THEY ARE KINDERGARTENS WHO

829
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
JUST LIVED THROUGH THAT NO ONE

830
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
SHOULD SEE.
HOW DO THEY COPE.

831
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
DR. MARK SEIGLE IS WITH ME.

832
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000

APPLY TO A FIVE YEAR OLD

836
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
CHILD?

837
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
IT IS RUN BECAUSE OF THE WARS

838
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
AND APPLIES TO CHILDREN, AND

839
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
STATISTICS ARE SHOCKING.

840
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
77 PERCENT OF THE KIDS IN THIS

841
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
SCHOOL ARE GOING TO SUFFER

842
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
FROM THESE SYMPTOMS AND 35

843
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
PERCENT OF THE KIDS IN THE

844
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
NEIGHBORHOOD NOT EVEN AT THE

845
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
SCHOOL.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

846
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
DISRUPTIONS AND FEELING ALONE

847
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
AND INABILITY TO TRUST ANYONE

848
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
AND RELIVING THES IN REVERSE

849
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
ORDER AND ANTICIPATING THE

850
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
NEXT TIME IT IS GOING TO

851
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
HAPPEN.

852
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
IT TAKES WEEKS AND MONTHS FOR

853
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
KIDS TO RECOVER FROM THIS.

854
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
LUCKY PSYCHOTHERAPY HELPS .

855
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
THEY HAVE TO GET THESE KIDS IN

856
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
THERAPY.

857
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
NI WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

858
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
ABOUT THAT, DOCTOR.

859
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW KIDS

860
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
REACT OVER TIME.

861
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE THIS

862
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
YOUNG.

863
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I TALKED TO A WOMAN, HER SIX

864
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
YORE OLD DAUGHTER IS OKAY.

865
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
AND HER MOTHER WAS TALKING FOR

866
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
HOURS AND FINALLY THE DAUGHTER

867
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
SAID TO THE MOM, ARE YOU GOING

868
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
TO BE OKAY?

869
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I KNOW OUR FOCUS IS ON THE

870
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
YOUNG CHILDREN.

871
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
BUT YOU WONDER HOW THE ADULTS

872
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
MANAGE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ONE

873
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
ANOTHER.

874
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I WOULD IMAGINE THERE IS IT A

875
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
LEVEL OF TRAUMA THAT PEEKS IN

876
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
THEIR LIVES AS WELL.

877
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT

878
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
THEN, DOCTOR?

879
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
>> THAT IS CRUCIAL.

880
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
AND THERE IS IT A TRAUM ATTIC

881
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
STRESS DISORDER AND AFFECT THE

882
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
FIRST REPONDERS AND PEOPLE WHO

883
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
STAW THIS.

884
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
AND WE ARE REPORTING WITH A

885
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
SHOCKING NUMBER OF WOUNDS AND

886
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
BOONS AND SOUNDS, THIS IS IT A

887
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
TOUGH ONE.

888
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
AND BEING, KIDS ARE GOING TO

889
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
LOOK TO THEIR PARENTS.

890
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME AND ARE

891
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
YOU AFRAID AND DO YOU SHOW

892
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
COURAGE.

893
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
THE SAME OF THE BRAIN DEAL

894
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
WITH OUR CARING AND THEY ARE

895
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
TREMEPPEDOUS.

896
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
WE SAW THEM BREWED BY PETER

897
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
JOHNSON IN THE MORNING AND

898
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
THEY ARE BONDING TOGETHER AND

899
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
HUGGING EACH OTHER AND THAT

900
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
WILL HELP THEM GET THROUGH

901
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
THIS, BILL.
>> YEAH, THERE WAS A HEALTH

902
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
CLINIC THAT CAME OVER FROM

903
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
YALE.
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT,

904
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
DOCTOR?

905
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
IT IS IT ALREADY UP AND

906
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
OPERATING.
AND THERE ARE MANY, DOZENS AND

907
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
DOZENS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

908
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
ALREADY SEEKING HELP FROM

909
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
THEM.

910
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU.

911
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
>> THAT IS IT CRUCIAL.

912
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
ANDLET SECRET IS NOT TO SHY

913
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
AWAY FROM IT.

914
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
BUT TO ALLOW THE CHILDREN AND

915
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
ADULTS TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES

916
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
AND TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY LIVED

917
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
THROUGH.
AND NO QUESTION IS OFF LIMS

918
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
HERE AND ANSWERS HAVE TO BE

919
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
HONEST AND DIRECT AND THEY

920
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
HAVE TO BE AS THEY COME AND WE

921
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
OUTSIDE LOOKING IN ON THIS

922
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
HAVE TO REMEMBER AND WE TALK

923
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
ABOUT OUR OWN CHILDREN, BUT

924
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
BILL, OUR OWN CHILDREN ARE

925
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
SAFE IS OUR OWN SCHOOLS ARE

926
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
SAFE.

927
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT

928
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE

929
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
HOMICIDES IN THE COUNTRY ARE

930
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
AROUND SCHOOLS.
WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE

931
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
CHILDREN AND SCHOOLS THAT

932
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
LIVED THROUGH IT.

933
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
LET'S TEAR CARE FOR THE PEOPLE

934
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
OUT THERE.

935
