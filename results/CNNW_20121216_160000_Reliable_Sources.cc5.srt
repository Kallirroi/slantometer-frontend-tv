00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
LEARN THE RESULTS OF THE

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
AUTOPSIES, AS YOU SAY, WERE

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
PERFORMED ON THE BODIES OF THE

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
GUNMAN AND HIS MOTHER.

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
ALREADY THIS MORNING WE LEARNED

00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
A HORRIFYING NEW DETAILS ABOUT

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
FRIDAY'S SCHOOL MASSACRE.

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
THE GUNMAN USED HIS ASSAULT

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
WEAPON LITERALLY TO SHOOT HIS

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
OWN ENTRY WAY INTO THE SCHOOL

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
BUILDING.

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
CONNECTICUT'S MEDICAL EXAMINER

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
SAID THE SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
FOUND AT THE SCENE WAS THE

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
PRIMARY WEAPON USED IN THIS

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
MASSACRE.
SUSAN CANDIOTTI REPORTS THAT

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE NOW TRYING TO

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
PIECE TOGETHER THE GUNMAN'S

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
ACTIONS IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE

92
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
SHOOTINGS.
LOOKING AT SURVEILLANCE VIDEO

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
FROM PLACES HE MAY HAVE VISITED.

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
ALL OF THIS UNFOLDING, EVEN AS

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW.

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
MEANWHILE, THE CONNECTICUT

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
GOVERNOR DAN MALLOY A FAMILIAR

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
FACE.
THIS MORNING, HE SPOKE TO OUR

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
OWN CANDY CROWLEY ON CNN'S

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
"STATE OF THE UNION."

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
CANDY JOINING US WITH MORE ON

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
THAT.
CANDY?
>> WOLF, THE GOVERNOR DID SAY,

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
IN FACT, THAT THE SHOOTER DID

104
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
BLAST HIS WAY INTO THAT

105
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
BUILDING, AS WE KNOW, BY NOW.

106
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
THERE WAS A BELL.

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
YOU HAD TO BE RUNG INTO THE

108
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
BUILDING FROM THE INSIDE.

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
BUT HE, INSTEAD, USED THAT

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC TO BLAST HIS WAY
INTO THE BUILDING.

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING AT HOW

113
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THESE GUNS ARE PURCHASED.

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THEY KNOW THEY WERE PURCHASED BY

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
THE MOTHER.

116
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
HE MENTIONED THAT -- DID SHE

117
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
ALLOW HER SON USE OF THEM EVEN

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
PRIOR TO THE DAY HE TOOK THEM

119
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
AND WENT INTO THAT ELEMENTARY

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
SCHOOL.

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
BUT THERE'S ALSO VERY PERSONAL

122
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
SIDE OF THIS INTERVIEW AND SAW

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
THE GOVERNOR VERY MUCH WITH

124
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
TEARS HIS EYES WHEN I ASKED HIM

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
ABOUT THAT TIME WHEN HE HAD TO

126
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
TELL THOSE PARENTS GATHERED AT

127
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
THE FIREHOUSE NEAR THE BUILDING

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
THAT THEIR CHILDREN WERE GONE

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
AND WOULD NOT BE COMING BACK.

130
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
TAKE A LISTEN TO THIS EXCHANGE.

131
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
>> CANDY, I WAS WITH THE VAST

132
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
MAJORITY OF THE FAMILIES FRIDAY

133
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
MORNING AND, ULTIMATELY, I HAD

134
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
TO BREAK IT TO ALL THE FOLKS

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
THAT WERE ASSEMBLED AT THE

136
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
FIREHOUSE THAT THEIR CHILDREN OR

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
THEIR LOVED ONE, IN THE CASE OF

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THE ADULTS, WERE NOT COMING

139
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
HOME.

140
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
AND THAT'S AN EXERCISE THAT I

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
WILL LIVE WITH FOR THE REST OF

142
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
MY LIFE.
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU'RE

143
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
PREPARED FOR AND, YOU KNOW, GO

144
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
ON.

145
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
BUT, LISTEN, I'M THE GOVERNOR OF

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT, WE

147
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
HAVE A JOB TO DO.

148
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
WE HAVE TO PROTECT PEOPLE, WE

149
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
HAVE TO HELP PEOPLE RECOVER, WE

150
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
HAVE TO MOVE ON AND GET CHILDREN

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
BACK TO SCHOOL AS QUICKLY AS

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
POSSIBLE IN THE BROADER SYSTEM.

153
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
AND HOPEFULLY THESE CHILDREN, AT

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
THIS SCHOOL, BACK TO SCHOOL, A

155
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
SCHOOL AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

156
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
>> MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD YOU

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
CORRE

158
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
CORRECTLY.

159
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
YOU HAD TO TELL THE FAMILIES IN

160
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
THAT ROOM THAT SOME FEARED OR

161
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
HAD KNOWN AT A GUT LEVEL, YOU

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
WERE THE ONE THAT FINALIZED FOR

163
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
THEM.
>> YES.
>> TELL ME ABOUT THAT MOMENT.

164
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
>> IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING

165
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
TO DO.
THESE PARENTS HAD BEEN GATHERED

166
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
FOR A NUMBER OF HOURS CLINGING

167
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
TO HOPE.

168
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
NEWS REPORTS WERE SWIRLING

169
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
AROUND THEM OUTSIDE THE

170
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
BUILDING.
AND SOMEONE HAD TO DECIDE HOW TO

171
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
HANDLE THAT SITUATION.

172
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
AND, UTIMALTIMATELY, IT FELL UPE

173
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
TO DO THAT.

174
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
YOU COULD NEVER BE PREPARED TO

175
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
TELL 18 OR 20 FOLKS OR,

176
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
ACTUALLY, FAMILIES, THAT THEIR

177
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
LOVED ONE WOULD NOT BE RETURNING

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
TO THEM THAT DAY OR IN THE

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
FUTURE IS A TOUGH ASSIGNMENT.

180
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
>> SO, YOU HEARD THE GOVERNOR

181
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
THERE, WOLF, TALK ABOUT.

182
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
YOU KNOW, IT'S SOMETHING YOU

183
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
LIVE WITH AND SO MUCH TALK NOW

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
IS GOING TO BE ABOUT MOVING ON

185
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
AND MOVING THROUGH THE GRIEF.

186
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
AND THE FACT IS, WE ALL KNOW

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THESE FAMILIES WILL NEVER BE THE

00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
THE DAY THE PERSON WHO FIRED THE

546
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
SHOTS WAS RYAN LANZA'S BROTHER,

547
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
ADAM.
>> CONTRARY TO CONFLICTING

548
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
INFORMATION THAT THEY HAD PASSED

549
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
ON, WE CAN NOW TELL YOU

550
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
ACCORDING TO SEVERAL SOURCES

551
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
THAT THE NAME OF THE SHOOTER IN

552
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
THIS CASE IS ADAM LANZA.

553
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
>> JOINING US NOW TO EXAMINE THE

554
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
COVERAGE OF WHAT UNFOLDED IN

555
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
CONNECTICUT.

LAUREN ASHBURN EDITOR AND CHIEF

557
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
OF DAILY DOWNLOAD.COM AND FRANK

558
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
SESNO AND A FORMER CNN

559
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF.

560
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
FRANK, YOU HAVE BEEN HERE WHEN

561
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
TRAGEDY ERUPTED AND YOU HAD TO

562
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
GO ON THE AIR WHEN INFORMATION

563
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
IS HARD TO COME BY.

564
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
WHY IS IT SO HARD WHEN THE

565
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
BROTHER WAS INACCURATELY

566
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
IDENTIFIED TO KEEP THAT
INFORMATION OFF THE AIR?

567
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
>> IT'S WHAT I CALL THE LANGUAGE

568
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
OF LIVE.
WE REPORT SOMETHING AS IT'S

569
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
HAPPENING AND QUITE OFTEN YOU'RE

570
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
FOLLOWING LAW ENFORCEMENT OR

571
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
ANYBODY ELSE DOWN THE WRONG PATH

572
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
OR DEAD END INFORMATION.
WHY IT WAS SO IMPORTANT WHEN YOU

573
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
HEARD THERE SUSAN CANDIOTTI TOLD

574
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
US SOURCES ARE BUILDING INTO THE

575
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
LANGUAGE THAT JOURNALISTS USE

576
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
THIS LANGUAGE OF UNCERTAINTY

577
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
BECAUSE THINGS DO CHANGE.

578
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
>> BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES

579
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
SOMETIMES PROVIDE INFORMATION

580
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
THAT TURNS OUT TO BE WRONG.

581
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE, LAURA

582
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
ASHBURN.

583
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
HOW OFTEN ARE JOURNALISTS'

584
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
CREDIBILITY.

585
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
>> HOW COULD YOU WRONGLY

586
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
IDENTIFY THE VICTIM, BUT, NOW, I

587
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
THINK PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THIS

588
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
IS THE WAY JOURNALISM IS.

589
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT WRONG

590
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
AND YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO

591
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT A

592
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
JOURNALIST TELLS YOU AND I THINK

593
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
THAT'S SAD.

594
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
>> I DON'T KNOW, I WROTE A

595
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
COLUMN REALLY CRITICAL OF THIS.

596
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
THIS GUY WAS IDENTIFIED FOR

597
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
HOURS.

598
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
NO ONE WENT TO TRY TO

599
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY THE LAW

600
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL DID.

601
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
>> YOU ACCEPT THE NOTION BECAUSE

602
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
SOMEBODY REPORTED IT AND THEN IT

603
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
CHANGES BECAUSE THIS IS A MOVING

604
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
STORY THIS IS JUST THE WAY IT

605
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
IS.

606
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
CAN WE DO BETTER?

607
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
>> OF COURSE WE CAN DO BETTER.

608
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
IN ONE PART, I AGREE WITH LAUREN

609
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
ABOUT PEOPLE ACCEPTING THIS MORE

610
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
BECAUSE OF ALL THE PROLIFERATION

611
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
OF NEW KINDS OF MEDIA.

612
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
BUT, HOWIE, IT'S AWFUL.

613
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
YOU KNOW, THEY PUT RYAN LANZA'S

614
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
PICTURE OUT THERE AND IT WAS

615
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
SHARED ON FACEBOOK 1,000 TIMES

616
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
IN A MINUTE.

617
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

618
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
THIS GUY IS SITTING ON A BUS

619
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
IDENTIFIED AS A MASS MUFRDERER

620
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
FOR HOURS.

621
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
SLATE SAID LOOK LIKE THAT

622
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
FACEBOOK PAGE OF RYAN LANZA WE

623
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
LINKED TO WAS INCORRECT.

624
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
>> GEE.
>> THANKS.

625
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
>> NO, LOOKS LIKE -- IT'S EITHER

626
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
INCORRECT, FRANK, OR IT'S NOT.

627
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
THIS LACK OF PRECISION IN

628
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
JOURNALISM IS WRONG.

629
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
>> WHEN STUFF IS HAPPENING AS

630
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
FAST AS IT HAPPENS HERE AND YOU

631
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
LIVE IN THE INSTANT INFORMATION

632
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
WORLD, THIS STUFF WILL HAPPEN.

633
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
IT CAN BE FOR DAYS, COME ON.

634
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
>> THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE

635
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
WRONG PERSON AND IDENTIFY HIM AS

636
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
A MASS MURDERER.

637
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
>> WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT

638
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
INFORMATION, RIGHT OR WRONG,

639
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
TRAVELS MUCH FASTER THAN

640
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
COOPERATION SOMETIMES.
AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

641
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
THAT THE SUSPECT WAS CARRYING A

642
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
BAD I.D., THAT INFORMATION CAME

643
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT.

644
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS THE ONLY

645
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
FORM OF INFORMATION THAT THE

646
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
MEDIA HAD AT THE TIME.

647
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
>> WHY?
>> THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE

648
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
TO GO INTO THE SCHOOL --

649
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
>> POST IT ON FACEBOOK WHO THEY

650
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
SAID WAS DEAD.

651
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
THAT WAS A SOURCE OF

652
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
INFORMATION.

653
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
>> IT'S HAPPENING IN REAL-TIME.

654
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
THE FOG OF WAR ON THE

655
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
BATTLEFIELD.

656
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
>> THAT'S A NICE TERM.

657
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
>> LET ME JUMP IN.

658
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
A LOT OF EMOTION HERE AT THIS

659
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
TABLE.
LAUREN, WHEN YOU WATCHED THE

660
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
COVERAGE, ADMITTEDLY, IT'S HARD

661
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
TO WATCH.

662
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
SEE ANCHORS AND CORRESPONDENTS

663
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
HAVING TO DEAL WITH THIS

664
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY, IT SEEMS

665
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP

666
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
THEIR EMOTIONS OUT OF IT,

667
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
DOESN'T IT?

668
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
>> OF COURSE.
WHEN I COVERED 9/1 1, THAT'S

669
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
EXACTLY WHAT I DID.

670
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I HAD THE PICTURE OF THE

671
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
PENTAGON BEHIND ME AND SMOKE

672
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
COMING UP AND YOU CAN'T THINK

673
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
ABOUT IT, AS SOLEDAD O'BRIEN

674
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
SAID EARLIER.

675
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
YOU CAN'T CALL YOUR CHILDREN,

676
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
YOU CAN'T GET INTO THAT

677
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
EMOTIONAL MINDSET.

678
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
HOWEVER, LOOKING AT IT YESTERDAY

679
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
FROM MY KITCHEN TABLE WHERE I

680
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
WAS WRITING CHRISTMAS CARDS IN

681
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
FRONT OF A FIRE, I COULDN'T HELP

682
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
BUT REALIZE THE DISPASSION THAT

683
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
THE JOURNALISTS DID HAVE AND I

684
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
QUESTION IN "THE DAILY BEAST"

685
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
PIECE THAT I WROTE WHETHER OR

686
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
NOT WE COULDN'T DO A LITTLE BIT

687
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
BETTER.
MAYBE IT WOULD SERVE THE

688
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
AUDIENCE A LITTLE BIT MORE TO

689
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
INJECT A LITTLE BIT OF EMOTION.

690
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I'M NOT SAYING LET'S START

691
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
CRYING AND DOING ALL OF THAT.

692
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
>> IT'S HUMANITY.

693
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

694
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
ABOUT.

695
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
IT'S HUMANITY.

696
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
>> I NEED TO KNOW, I NEED TO SEE

697
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
THAT IT IS AFFECTING THEM THE

698
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
WAY IT IS AFFECTING THE PEOPLE

699
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
AT HOME.
>> LET ME ASK YOU A RELATED

700
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
QUESTION WHICH WE'VE SEEN FROM

701
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
MANY OF THE NETWORKS, INTERVIEWS

702
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
WITH SOME OF THE YOUNG

703
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN AND

704
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
BASICALLY EYEWITNESSES TO WHAT

705
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
HAPPENED.
SOMETIMES THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED

706
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
BY PARENTS.

707
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
CNN POLICY PARENTS HAVE TO GIVE

708
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
PERMISSION.
>> I DO NOT WANT TO SEE IT.

709
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I DO NOT WANT TO SEE IT.

710
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
LOOK.
YOU MAKE THAT DECISION ON A

711
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
CASE-BY-CASE BASIS BUT TO HAVE

712
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
AN 8-YEAR-OLD OR 6-YEAR-OLD

713
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
DESCRIBE THIS SCENE, I FEEL LIKE

714
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
IT'S LUDICROUS TO PUT THAT ON

715
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
TELEVISION.
GET AN ADULT.

716
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
YOU KNOW, LEAVE THAT POOR CHILD

717
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
ALONE.

718
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE WHOLE QUESTION

719
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
OF, STARTING TO HEAR RUMBLINGS

720
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
ABOUT A GUN CONTROL DEBATE.

721
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
YOU HAVE THE PARTISANS COME ON

722
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
AND THEY TAKE THEIR SHOT.

723
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
IT'S THE FAULT OF GUNS, IT'S NOT

724
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
THE FAULT OF GUNS.

725
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
WHEN IT COMES TO STRAIGHT

726
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
REPORTING, CONGRESS IS NOT GOING

727
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000

00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I THINK THE TERMS DO MATTER

909
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
HERE.
SECOND OF ALL, JUST THIS WHOLE

910
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
IDEA THAT IT'S LINKED WITH

911
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
VIOLENCE IN SOME WAY AND

912
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
SPECIFICALLY PREPLANNED

913
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
VIOLENCE, I THINK WE CAN

914
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
DISPENSE WITH THAT.

915
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
>> THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT

916
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
AUTISM WOULD GENERATE A MASS

917
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
MURDER LIKE THIS?

918
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

919
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY,

920
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
BUT EVEN SINCE THEN I TALKED TO

921
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
A FEW MORE EXPERTS.

922
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I LOOKED AT THE DEFINITIVE STUDY

923
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
ON THIS, WOLF, THE STUDY

924
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
EVERYONE QUOTES WHEN LOOKING AT

925
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
THIS EXACT ISSUE.

926
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
132 PEOPLE WERE STUDIED IN THAT

927
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
PARTICULAR STUDY.

928
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
OF THOSE, 3 PEOPLE HAD SOME

929
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
EVIDENCE OF VIOLENCE, SMALL

930
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
NUMBER, BUT NONE OF THEM HAD

931
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
WHAT WAS THOUGHT OF AS

932
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
PREPLANNED VIOLENCE.

933
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
THOSE ARE, IN FACT, REACTIONARY

934
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
VIOLENCE AND OUTBURST, NOT

935
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
SOMETHING THAT REQUIRED ANY SORT

936
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
OF PLANNING.

937
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
>> ARE THERE ANY OTHER MENTAL

938
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
ILLNESSES THAT COULD CAUSE THIS

939
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
KIND OF VIOLENCE?
>> SURE.

940
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
OTHER SORTS OF THINGS THAT YOU

941
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
THINK ABOUT WITH REGARD TO SOME

942
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
SORT OF MANIC THING.

943
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
SOME SORT OF LOSS OF JUDGMENT

944
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
AND INHIBITION OF JUDGMENT.

945
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
WE TALK ABOUT DEPRESSION.

946
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
OBVIOUSLY, ANGER ISSUES HERE.

947
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
BUT IN ASSOCIATION WITH MENTAL

948
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
ILLNESS, NOT BECAUSE OF AUTISM,

949
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
ASPERGER OR ANYTHING ELSE ALONE.

950
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
>> SOMETIMES YOU HEAR ABOUT

951
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
THESE ATROCITIES AND SOMETIMES

952
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
PEOPLE SAY, YOU KNOW, HE JUST

953
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
SNAPPED.

954
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
SO, MEDICALLY SPEAKING, WHAT

955
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
DOES THAT MEAN?

956
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
>> WHEN SOMEONE -- AGAIN, THAT

957
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
DOES REFER TO SOME SORT OF

958
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
REACTION TO SOMETHING, USUALLY.
OR SOME SORT OF SOMEBODY WAS

959
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
PREDISPOSED TO SOMETHING AND

960
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
SOMETHING PUSHED SOMEBODY OVER

961
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
THE EDGE.
THE DIFFERENCE, AGAIN, WOLF,

962
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
INVESTIGATORS ALWAYS THINK ABOUT

963
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
THIS AND ALSO IN MY FIELD,

964
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
FORENSIC MEDICAL EXAMINERS LOOK

965
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
AT THIS AND SOMETIMES YOU DON'T

966
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
KNOW THE ANSWER EXACTLY.
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WANT TO

967
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
KNOW, WAS THERE EVIDENCE OF

968
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
PLANNING?
SOME SORT OF EVIDENCE OF

969
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
PLANNING?

970
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
BECAUSE IF THERE WAS, IT REALLY

971
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
CHANGES THE DISCUSSION

972
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
COMPLETELY.
CHANGES IT FROM A LAW

973
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
ENFORCEMENT STANDPOINT WHICH IS

974
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
WHERE PEOPLE FOCUS THEIR

975
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
ATTENTION BUT ALSO FROM A
MEDICAL STANDPOINT.

976
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
FORENSIC MEDICAL EXAMINATION.

977
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
>> CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, AT

978
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
LEAST ANECDOTALLY IN COVERING

979
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
THESE STORIES, IT'S USUALLY A

980
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
MALE WHO COMMITS THIS KIND OF

981
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
MASS MURDER, NOT A FEMALE.

982
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
IS THERE A GENDER -RELATED ISSUE

983
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
HERE?

984
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

985
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
AGAIN, THE NUMBERS DO BEAR THAT

986
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
OUT.
IF YOU LOOK, AGAIN, NOT JUST AT,

987
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
OBVIOUSLY, THE STUDY THAT I

988
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
TALKED ABOUT BUT ALL SORTS OF

989
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
THESE SORT OF VIOLENT ATTACKS

990
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
AND MASS MURDER TYPE OF ATTACKS,

991
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
THEY'RE GENERALLY MALE.

992
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
WHAT TO MAKE OF THAT IS UNCLEAR.

993
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT NEURAL

994
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
DISORDER, WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE

995
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HIS MIND OR

996
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
WHAT HIS BACKGROUND IS, THAT IS

997
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
SOMETHING YOU TYPICALLY HAVE

998
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
SINCE BIRTH.

999
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS

1000
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
INHERITED.

1001
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
IT'S AN INHERITED COMPONENT TO

1002
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
IT AND EVEN WHILE YOU'RE

1003
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
DEVELOPING AS A HUMAN BEING.

1004
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
AGAIN, I SAY THAT TO DISTINGUISH

1005
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
IT FROM MANY OTHER FORMS OF

1006
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
MENTAL ILLNESS.

1007
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
ALSO WITH REGARD TO GENDER, YOU

1008
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
KNOW, IF THERE IS A MALE

1009
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
PREPONDERANCE OF THIS AND A

1010
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
GENETIC LINK, YOU CAN PUT THE

1011
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
TWO AND TWO TOGETHER.

1012
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE, BUT,

1013
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
AGAIN, I THINK THAT'S WHAT

1014
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
PEOPLE --

1015
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
>> THE VIDEO GAMES.

1016
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
YOU KNOW, THESE KIND OF VIOLENT

1017
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
VIDEO GAMES, BOYS DO IT A LOT

1018
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
MORE THAN GIRLS.

1019
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
IS THERE A CONNECTION

1020
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
POTENTIALLY?
>> I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT

1021
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
THERE IS A CONNECTION.

1022
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
WOLF, LET ME SAY, THEY HAVE

1023
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
KNOWN ABOUT A CONNECTION, NOT

1024
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
WITH VIDEO GAMES BUT VIOLENT

1025
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
PROGRAMMING FOR 40 YEARS.

1026
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
WROTE ABOUT THIS IN 1972 AND

1027
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
WROTE ABOUT IT AND OVER THE LAST

1028
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
40 YEARS, BACK THEN IT WAS

1029
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
TELEVISION BUT DIFFERENT SORTS

1030
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
OF AVENUES HAVE HAPPENED NOW.

1031
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
PRETTY GOOD SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE

1032
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
TO SHOW SOME KIND OF CONNECTION

1033
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
BETWEEN VIDEO GAMING AND

1034
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
VIOLENCE.

1035
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
MOST PEOPLE WHO PLAY VIDEO GAMES

1036
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
AREN'T VIOLENT, BUT THERE IS A

1037
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
CONNECTION.

1038
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
>> SANJAY, THANKS VERY MUCH.

1039
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
GOOD ADVICE.

1040
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
>>> WE'RE AWAITING THE NEWS

1041
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
CONFERENCE, CONNECTICUT STATE
POLICE GETTING READY TO GO TO

1042
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
THE MICROPHONES HERE IN NEWTOWN,

1043
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
CONNECTICUT, TO UPDATE US ON THE
INVESTIGATION.


1044
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
>>> WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.

1045
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
YOU CAN SEE THE LIVE PICTURES

1046
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
HERE.

1047
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
MICROPHONES STANDING BY EVERYONE

1048
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
HERE FOR THE PRESS CONFERENCE

1049
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
WITH LIEUTENANT VANCE FROM THE

1050
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
STATE POLICE AND ALSO THE

1051
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
STATE'S MEDICAL EXAMINER.

1052
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
WE'RE EXPECTING THEM TO UPDATE

1053
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
US ON SOME OF THE DETAILS THAT

1054
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
THEY HAVE BEEN TELLING US THAT

1055
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
THEY WILL FOCUS ON IN THIS NEXT

1056
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
PRESS CONFERENCE.

1057
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
FOR EXAMPLE, WE'LL KNOW ABOUT

1058
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
THE WEAPONRY, THE CALIBER OF THE

1059
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
WEAPONS THAT WERE USED AND

1060
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED, THE

1061
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
TIMELINE OF THE EVENTS ON THIS

1062
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE MASSACRE THAT

1063
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
HAPPENED ON FRIDAY MORNING.

1064
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
WE'RE ALSO EXPECTED TO HEAR SOME

1065
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE

1066
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
AUTOPSIES THAT SHOULD, BY NOW,

1067
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
HAVE BEEN PERFORMED ON THE

1068
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
SHOOTER AND HIS MOTHER.

1069
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
THOSE WERE THE LAST TWO THEY

1070
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
WERE WAITING TO COMPLETE.

1071
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
ROUGHLY TWO DOZEN JOURNALISTS

1072
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
WHO ARE GATHERED HERE.

1073
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
WE'RE EXPECTING SOME MORE TO

1074
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
COME, AS WELL.
THEY TOLD US THIS PRESS

1075
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
CONFERENCE WOULD HAPPEN IN THE

1076
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
NEXT FEW MINUTES.

1077
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
WE'VE HEARD THEY'RE ON THEIR

1078
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
WAY.

1079
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
AS SOON AS IT HAPPENS, WE WILL,

1080
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
OBVIOUSLY, BRING THAT TO YOU

1081
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
LIVE.
>>> THIS MORNING, CONNECTICUT'S

1082
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
GOVERNOR TOLD CNN THAT THE

1083
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
GUNMAN GOT INTO THE SCHOOL

1084
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
LITERALLY BY USING THE ASSAULT

1085
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
WEAPON TO SHOOT THE ENTRANCE

1086
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
INTO THE BUILDING.

1087
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
HE BLEW OUT A WHOLE BIG ENOUGH

1088
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
THAT HE COULD WALK THROUGH.

1089
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER SAID THE

1090

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
MANNER ALL RIGHT, CAN BE

1271
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
CONSTRUED AS A VIOLATION OF

1272
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
STATE OR FEDERAL LAW WILL BE

1273
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
PROSECUTED.
WILL BE INVESTIGATED AND

1274
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
PROSECUTED.

1275
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
QUESTIONS, I CAN TAKE A FEW,

1276
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
UNDERSTANDING WE STILL ARE

1277
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
ACTIVE IN THIS CASE.

1278
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
OKAY.
>> HAS A VERY SPECIFIC TIMELINE

1279
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
OF HOW THIS EVENT HAPPENED.

1280
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN, IN

1281
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
FACT, CONFIRM THAT TIMELINE THAT

1282
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
IS BEING REPORTED IN GREAT

1283
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
DETAIL BY THE "HARTFORD

1284
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
COURANT."
>> VERY GOOD QUESTION.

1285
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I'M THE ONLY ONE SPEAKING ABOUT

1286
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
THIS CASE TO EVERY MEMBER OF THE

1287
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
MEDIAP.
I CANNOT STATE HEAVILY ENOUGH I

1288
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
HAVE NOT AND WILL NOT PUT OUT A

1289
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
TIMELINE IN THIS CRIMINAL

1290
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
INVESTIGATION AS IT IS UNDER

1291
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
WAY.
IT IS INAPPROPRIATE.

1292
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
WE WILL NOT DO THAT.

1293
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
ANY SOURCES THAT ARE PUTTING OUT
ANY KIND OF INFORMATION LIKE

1294
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
THAT DOES NOT COME FROM THE

1295
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
OFFICIAL INVESTIGATING AGENCY,

1296
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE

1297
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
ASSISTED BY THE NEWTOWN POLICE

1298
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
DEPARTMENT.

1299
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
WE WILL NOT PUT THAT OUT AS THE

1300
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING.

1301
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
>> I HAVE NOT READ IT.

1302
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

1303
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
WE HAVE NOT PUT OUT ANY TIMELINE

1304
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
INFORMATION.

1305
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
>> YOU HAVE SAID THERE WERE TWO

1306
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
PLACES INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

1307
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT THE

1308
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
PRINCIPAL AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST

1309
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
WAS SHOT NEAR THE FRONT DOOR AND

1310
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
THE CHILDREN AND THE TEACHERS

1311
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
AND OTHER WORKERS WERE IN

1312
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
CLASSROOMS?

1313
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
>> AGAIN, WHAT I STATED RELATIVE

1314
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
TO THE INTERIOR CRIME SCENE, WAS

1315
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
THAT THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE IN

1316
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
A SINGULAR SECTION OF THE

1317
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
SCHOOL, THAT INVOLVED TWO

1318
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
CLASSROOMS AND A HALLWAY.

1319
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
THAT'S AS MUCH AS WE SAID ABOUT

1320
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
THAT.

1321
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT DESCRIBE

1322
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
THE LOCATION OF THE DECEASED IN

1323
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
THIS INVESTIGATION.

1324
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
WE WON'T DO THAT.

1325
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
>> YES, SIR.

1326
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
>> SIR?

1327
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
>> SAID YOUR INVESTIGATION OF

1328
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
FIREARMS.
>> YES, SIR.

1329
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
>> THE SHOOTER WAS TAKEN BY HIS

1330
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
FAMILY MEMBER TO A SHOOTING

1331
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
RANGE [ INAUDIBLE ].
GONE SHOOTING WITH HIS MOTHER?

1332
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT, QUITE

1333
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
FRANKLY.
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO

1334
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT

1335
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
WE CAN'T TAKE SEGMENTS OF AN

1336
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSS THAT

1337
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
PUBLICLY BECAUSE SOMETHING TAKEN

1338
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
OUT OF CONTEXT COULD BE

1339
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
MISINTERPRETED, IT COULD BE

1340
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
MISINTERPRETED AND NOT FACTUAL

1341
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
ONCE IT'S MISINTERPRETED.

1342
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
THEREFORE, I DON'T, NUMBER ONE,

1343
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT

1344
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
PARTICULAR STATEMENT YOU JUST
MADE AND NUMBER TWO, EVEN IF I

1345
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
DID, I WOULD SAY LET US PUT IT

1346
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
INTO THE CONTENTS OF THE

1347
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
INVESTIGATION SO THAT WE CAN

1348
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
MANAGE IT AND YOU CAN GET A

1349
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
WHOLE COMPLETE PICTURE OF EXA

1350
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON.

1351
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
>> DO I KNOW ANYTHING MORE?

1352
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
THE FOUR FIREARMS WORKING WITH

1353
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND AS I

1354
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
SAID IN MY STATEMENT WE ARE

1355
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
ANALYZING, EXAMINING, WE'LL

1356
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
TRACE THEM BACK TO THEIR ORIGIN,

1357
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
WE'LL TRACE EVERY STEP OF THE

1358
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
WAY, AND EVERY TIME THAT WE CAN,

1359
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
WHERE THEY WERE USED, HOW THEY

1360
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
WERE USED WILL BE EXAMINED FOR

1361
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
RENICALLY.
A GREAT DEAL OF WORK MUST BE

1362
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
DONE ON THOSE WEAPONS.

1363
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
>> [ INAUDIBLE ].

1364
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
>> ANY EVIDENCE THAT ANY OF THE

1365
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
OTHER WEAPONS --

1366
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
>> I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

1367
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I DO NOT KNOW.

1368
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
OUR DETECTIVES WILL BE ABLE TO

1369
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
ANSWER THAT QUESTION AT THE

1370
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
CONCLUSION OF THE INVESTIGATION.

1371
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
>> YES, SIR.
>> I KNOW YOU CAN'T GO INTO

1372
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
DETAIL ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE FINDING

1373
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
BUT HOW CONFIDENT DO YOU FEEL

1374
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
YOU WILL EVENTUALLY GET A GOOD

1375
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
PICTURE?
>> I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE

1376
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
WILL PUT EVERY SINGLE RESOURCE

1377
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000

THAT IS HUMANLY POSSIBLE AT THE

1381
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
CONCLUSION OF THIS CASE.

1382
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
WE'LL EXAMINE EVERY PIECE OF

1383
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
EVIDENCE, WE'LL SPEAK TO EVERY

00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000

BE ABLE IT TO PUT TOGETHER

1392
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
SOMETHING PEOPLE WOULD

1393
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
CONSIDER --

1394
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
>> JUST TO SAY, WE HAVE NOT

1395
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
STATED WHAT EVIDENCE WE HAVE AND

1396
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
HAVE NOT COLLECTED.

1397
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I WANT TO MAKE THAT PERFECTLY

1398
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000

00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
PAINT A COMPLETE PICTURE SO THAT

00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
WE ALL KNOW AND THE PUBLIC KNOWS

1413
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

I CANNOT.
>> SOCIAL MEDIA WHAT DO YOU MAKE

1419
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
OF THAT?

1420
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
>> WELL, BEST I CAN EXPLAIN, I'M

1421
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
NOT A SOCIAL MEDIA EXPERT, I'M

1422
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
NOT GOING TO CLAIM TO BE, BUT

1423
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
THERE HAVE BEEN INDICATIONS THAT

1424
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
THERE HAVE BEEN QUOTES BY PEOPLE

1425
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
WHO ARE POSING AS THE SHOOTER.

1426
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
YOU CAN GO ON DIFFERENT FACEBOOK

PAGES AND FIND THIS INFORMATION

1428

I KNOW MEMBERS OF THE PRESS

1429
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
HAVE.
AND SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT THE

1430
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000

1431
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000

OTHER PEOPLE, AND DISCUSSING

1435
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
WITH FEDERAL AUTHORITIES THEY

1436
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
BELIEVE IT'S A VIOLATION OF

1437
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
STATE OR FEDERAL LAW AND

1438
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
WARRANTS AN INVESTIGATION.

1439
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
ANYONE PERPETRATING THAT

1440
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
INFORMATION, COULD, IN FACT, BE

1441
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
SUBJECT TO ARREST AND BE

1442
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
PROSECUTED FEDERALLY.

1443
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000

NOW.

1446
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
THIS IS BRAND NEW INFORMATION,

ABOUT SAFETY IN SCHOOL IS FROM

1470
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
THE EDUCATIONAL COMMISSIONER IN

1471
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000

1473
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
BEING EXAMINED ON A LOCAL AND

1474
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
STATEWIDE BASIS.

1475
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
THERE ARE MANY PLANS IN PLACE

1476
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES IN ALL

1477
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
THE SCHOOLS IN CONNECTICUT.

1478
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
ALL OF THEM ARE BEING REEXAMINED

1479
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
AND CERTAINLY PARENTS SHOULD, IN

1480
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
FACT, BE CONFIDENT THAT LAW

1481
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
ENFORCEMENT IN EVERY COMMUNITY,

EDUCATORS, THE LEADERS OF THE

1484
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
SCHOOL SYSTEMS ARE DOING

1485
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE

1486
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
THAT THE SCHOOLS IN CONNECTICUT

1487
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
ARE SAFE.

1488
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I WOULD LIKE THE LIEUTENANT TO

1489
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
TALK ABOUT THE SCHOOLS IN

1490
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
NEWTOWN.

HERE.

1495
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE STILL VERY

1496
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
SENSITIVE TO THE FAMILY IN THIS

1497
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
SITUATION.

1498
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD VERY

1499
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
SLOWLY AND RESPECTFULLY.

1500
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
THEY HAVE SOME TENTATIVE PLANS

1501
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
AS FAR AS MOVING FORWARD WITH

1502
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
THE SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL SYSTEM

1503
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
WILL BE PUTTING THOSE OUT IN THE

1504
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
NEAR FUTURE.

1505
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
>> DO YOU IMAGINE THAT CHILDREN

1506
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
WILL EVER RETURN TO CLASS IN

1507
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
THAT BUILDING?
>> YOU KNOW, AT THIS TIME IT'S

1508
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
TOO EARLY TO SAY.

1509
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
BUT I WOULD FIND IT VERY

1510
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO THAT.

1511
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
BUT CERTAINLY THAT'S ONE OF THE

1512
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
THINGS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

1513
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
HAVE TO LOOK INTO, YES.

1514
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000

IT'S TENTATIVE PLANS RIGHT NOW.

1520
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
BUT AS WE SAID, WE'RE TRYING TO

1521
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
BE AS RESPECTFUL AS WE CAN.

1522
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
WE WANT TO KEEP THESE KIDS

1523
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
TOGETHER.
WE NEED SUPPORT OF EACH OTHER.

1524
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
>> COUPLE MORE QUICK QUESTIONS.

00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
