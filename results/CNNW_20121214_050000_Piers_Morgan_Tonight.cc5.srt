1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
MIND THAT THE OVERWHELMING

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
MAJORITY OF OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
UNIFORM ABIDE BY THE HIGHEST

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
STANDARDS.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE THAT,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
YOU KNOW, THAT ENGAGE IN THE

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
WRONG KIND OF BEHAVIOR, THAT DO

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
THINGS THAT ABUSE THE SYSTEM,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE NOT ONLY

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
TO PROSECUTE AND TO PUNISH THOSE

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
THAT DO THAT, BUT TO MAKE SURE

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
THAT WE'RE TAKING STEPS TO

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABIDING BY

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
THE HIGHEST STANDARDS, AND
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
>>> TONIGHT, TEAM OBAMA TAKES A
BIG HIT.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
SUSAN RICE DROPS OUT OF THE

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
RUNNING FOR SECRETARY OF STATE

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
AFTER A BRUISING BATTLE WITH

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
CRITICS LIKE JOHN McCAIN.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
>> SHE NOT ONLY GAVE WRONG

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
INFORMATION, BUT SHE GAVE THE

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
PARTY LINE.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
>> NOW IS JOHN KERRY A LOCK FOR

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
STATE?

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
>>> AND THE OTHER BIG LATE STORY

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
IN WASHINGTON, SPEAKER BOEHNER

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
GOES TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
HOW CLOSE ARE THEY NOW TO A

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
DEAL?

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
RUDOLPH GIULIANI IS HERE TO SAY

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
A LOT ABOUT THESE THINGS.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'LL ASK HIM IF AMERICA IS

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
GETTING MORE DANGEROUS IN THE

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
WAKE SOME OF VERY SHOCKING

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
HIGH-PROFILE GUN CRIME.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
>>> HE WAS KNOWN AS ONE OF THE

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
WEST MEMPHIS THREE NOW DAMIEN

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
ECHOLS IS ADJUSTING TO LIFE AS A

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
FREE MAN.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
>> I WAS IN A STATE OF EXTREME

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
SHOCK AND TRAUMA.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
>> AND HOW HE SURVIVED 18 YEARS

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
ON DEATH ROW.

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
>> IT'S ABSOLUTELY NIGHTMARISH.

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
>> THIS IS "PIERS MORGAN
TONIGHT."

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
>>> GOOD EVENING, YOU'RE LOOKING

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS HAD ONE OF

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
THOSE WIN SOME, LOSE SOME KIND

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
OF DAYS.

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
THE PRESIDENT AND JOHN BOEHNER

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
MET FOR 50 MINUTES IN A MEETING

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
BEING CALLED FRANK.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
WHEN BASICALLY TRANSLATES TO NO

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
DEAL YET.

56
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
BUT THE GOOD NEWS WAS, QUOTE,

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION

58
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
REMAIN OPEN.

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
THE BAD NEWS, AMBASSADOR SUSAN

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
RICE WAS WITHDRAWING FROM THE
SHORT LIST TO REPLACE HILLARY

61
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
CLINTON AS SECRETARY OF STATE.

62
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
>> I WITHDREW MY NAME BECAUSE I

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR

64
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
THE COUNTRY AND I THINK IT'S THE
RIGHT THING FOR THE PRESIDENT.

65
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
PUTTING THOSE THINGS TOGETHER,

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THAT MAKES IT THE RIGHT THING

67
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
FOR ME AND MY FAMILY.

68
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
>> RUDOLPH GIULIANI.

69
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY VOCAL ABOUT

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
SUSAN RICE.

71
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
WERE YOU SURPRISED IN THE END

72
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
THAT SHE FELL ON HER SWORD

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
TODAY?
>> NOT AT ALL.

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
IN FACT I DON'T SEE THAT AS BAD

75
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
NEWS FOR THE PRESIDENT.

76
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I SEE THAT AS GOOD NEWS FOR THE

77
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
PRESIDENT, BECAUSE A BATTLE TO

78
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
GET HER CONFIRMED WOULD HAVE

79
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
OFFERED THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

80
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
TO OPEN UP THIS WHOLE BENGHAZI

81
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
THING, WHERE NO ANSWERS HAVE YET

82
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
BEEN GIVEN.

83
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
>> YOU WERE ON TELEVISION WITH

84
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
HER.

85
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
>> I WAS, I WAS.

86
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
>> ON THAT FATEFUL MORNING.

87
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
>> I WAS ON THE CANDY CROWLEY

88
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
SHOW WHEN SHE APPEARED, RIGHT

89
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
HERE IN THIS BUILDING.

90
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
WATCHED IT, HAD MY LITTLE PAD IN

91
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
FRONT OF ME.

92
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
WHEN SHE SAID IT -- HONESTLY,

93
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
WHEN SHE SAID IT, I UTTERED AN

94
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
EXPRESSION THAT I CAN'T SAY ON

95
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
TELEVISION.
IT STARTS WITH A B.

96
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
BULL --

97
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
>> YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE IT?

98
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
>> I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT BECAUSE

99
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
HERE YOU HAD AN ATTACK WITH

100
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
ROCKET-PROPELLED HAND GRENADES,

101
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
MORTARS, VERY WELL EXECUTED,

102
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
VERY WELL PREPARED.

103
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE MORE

104
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
SENSITIVE TO IT BECAUSE IT WAS

105
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER

106
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
11th, I HAD JUST COME FROM A

107
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
DINNER WITH ALL THE PEOPLE THAT

108
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
SURVIVED SEPTEMBER 11th WITH ME.

109
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I SAID IS THIS WOMAN OUT OF HER
MIND?

110
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT, A

111
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
SPONTANEOUS ATTACK?

112
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
DID SOMEBODY GIVE HER THAT?

113
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
AND THIS IDEA THAT SHE JUST READ

114
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
THE NOTES.

115
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
DON'T YOU EXERCISE SOME

116
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THIS?

117
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
>> IN AN OP-ED PIECE IN THE

118
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
"WASHINGTON POST" SHE SAYS THESE

119
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
UNCLASSIFIED POINTS SHE RECEIVED

120
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE

121
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
CLASSIFIED ASSESSMENTS I

122
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
RECEIVED AS A SENIOR POLICY

123
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
MAKER.

124
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I HAVE NEVER SOUGHT IN ANY WAY,

125
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
SHAPE OR FORM TO MISLEAD THE

126
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
AMERICAN PUBLIC.

127
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
TO DO SO WOULD RUN COUNTER TO MY

128
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
CHARACTER AND MY LIFE OF PUBLIC

129
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
SERVICE.

130
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
IN RECENT WEEKS, NEW LINES OF

131
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
ATTACK HAVE BEEN RAISED TO

132
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
MALIGN MY CHARACTER AND MY
CAREER.

133
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
WITH ALL THE GENERAL PETRAEUS

134
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
CONFUSION, THERE WAS AN

135
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
IMPLICATION THAT PERHAPS SHE HAD

136
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
WITHHELD CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

137
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
FOR NATIONAL SECURITY REASONS,

138
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
WHICH WAS THE BIT THAT HAD

139
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
LINKED TO POSSIBLE AL QAEDA

140
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
INVOLVEMENT.

141
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
SHE'S MAKING IT PRETTY CLEAR,

142
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
THOUGH, THAT ALL THE
INTELLIGENCE SHE RECEIVED,

143
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
CLASSIFIED OR UNCLASSIFIED, WAS

144
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
CONSISTENT.

145
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
THEREFORE, WE HAVE TO ASSUME DID

146
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
NOT SAY THIS IS LIKELY TO HAVE

147
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
BEEN AN AL QAEDA-RELATED ATTACK.

148
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
>> AND SHE DEMONSTRATED SHE'S AN

149
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
READER OF NOTES AND NOT AN

150
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
ANALYZER OF EVENTS.

151
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
>> WHAT WAS HER JOB THAT DAY,

152
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
RUDY, TO BE FAIR?

153
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
>> COMMON SENSE.

154
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
THEY GAVE HER A STORY THAT

155
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
DIDN'T MEET THE SMELL TEST.

156
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
A STRONG PERSON SAYS GARBAGE,

157
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT IT.
I'M SORRY.

158
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I HAVE DONE THAT.

159
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO
ME.

160
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE THAT THIS

161
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
WAS A SPONTANEOUS ATTACK.

162
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS

163
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
TREMENDOUS PRESSURE TO TRY TO

164
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
SAY THIS WAS A SPONTANEOUS

165
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
ATTACK, TRY TO LINK IT TO THAT

166
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
MOHAMMED MOVIE THAT PRESIDENT

167
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
OBAMA TRIED TO LINK IT TO FOR

168
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THE NEXT TWO WEEKS.

169
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
>> DO YOU THINK SHE LIED?

170
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT.

171
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
FOR ME SHE'S UNQUALIFIED TO BE

172
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
SECRETARY OF STATE BECAUSE SHE

173
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE

174
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT TO MAKE

175
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
ANALYSIS LIKE THESE TALKING

176
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
POINTS DON'T MAKE SENSE.

177
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID AFTER

178
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
THE RESIGNATION CAME IN, I

179
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
DEEPLY REGRET THE UNFAIR AND

180
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
MISLEADING ATTACKS ON SUSAN RICE

181
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
IN RECENT WEEKS.

182
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
THE OTHER THING I'VE BEEN

183
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
HEARING TODAY FROM MANY PEOPLE

184
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
IN WASHINGTON IS, LOOK, YES, THE

185
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
BENGHAZI THING WAS PROBABLY PART

186
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
OF THIS, BUT ACTUALLY WHAT

187
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
WORSENED HER CASE REALLY WAS

188
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
WHEN SHE WENT TO TRY AND HAVE IT

189
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
OUT WITH SENATORS McCAIN AND THE

190
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
OTHERS AND REALLY CAME OFF

191
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
SECOND BEST AGAIN.

192
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
SHE GOT LED DOWN A GARDEN PATH

193
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
AND CAME OUT WITH THORNS

194
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
EVERYWHERE.

195
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
AND PEOPLE WERE SAYING, YOU

196
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
KNOW, SHE'S JUST A BIT

197
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
INEXPERIENCED TO DEAL WITH

198
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
BRUISES LIKE THIS.

199
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR HER ON

200
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
THE WORLD STAGE.

201
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
IS THAT A FAIR CRITICISM?

202
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
>> ALSO FAIR.

203
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
WAS SHE IN ABOVE HER HEAD?

204
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
QUITE POSSIBLE.

205
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
MAYBE SHE WAS IN ABOVE HER HEAD

206
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
AND NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING HOW

207
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
TO ANALYZE INTELLIGENCE WELL

208
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
ENOUGH.

209
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
NOT HAVING ENOUGH INDEPENDENT

210
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
KNOWLEDGE TO APPLY TO IT TO

211
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
REALIZE THIS IS A MISTAKE.

212
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
WHEN I HEARD IT, WHEN JOHN

213
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
McCAIN HEARD IT, WE IMMEDIATELY

214
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
KNEW IT WAS A STORY THAT JUST

215
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
DIDN'T FLY.

216
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
MAYBE BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT MORE

217
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
EXPERIENCE THAN SHE DOES.

218
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
>> I INTERVIEWED JOHN McCAIN AND

219
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
LINDSEY GRAHAM THIS WEEK WHO

220
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
BOTH SAID THIS.

221
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
WATCH THIS.

222
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
>> THE FACT IS SHE NOT ONLY GAVE

223
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
WRONG INFORMATION, BUT SHE GAVE

224
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
THE PARTY LINE THAT, FOR

225
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
EXAMPLE, THAT AL QAEDA IS

226
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
DECIMATED.

227
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
AL QAEDA IS NOT DECIMATED.

228
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
THAT OUR EMBASSIES AND

229
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
CONSULATES ARE SECURE.

230
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
THEY ARE NOT SECURE.

231
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
SO EVERYBODY -- WE ARE ALL

232
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WE SAY.

233
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
SO WE'LL GO THROUGH THE PROCESS,

234
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
IF SHE IS NOMINATED, AND WE'LL

235
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
SEE.

236
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
>> I THINK THE INTELLIGENCE WAS

237
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
SANITIZED OR CREATED A FALSE

238
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
NARRATIVE.

239
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE WHERE.

240
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
>> WOULD YOU OBJECT TO HER
BECOMING SECRETARY OF STATE

241
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
PERSONALLY?

242
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
>> PERSONALLY I DON'T BELIEVE

243
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
SHE WOULD SERVE THE COUNTRY WELL

244
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
IN THAT CAPACITY.

245
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
>> WE'RE WILLING TO GIVE HER THE

246
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
NOMINATION PROCESS, BUT SHE'S

247
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
GOT A LOT TO PROVE.

248
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
>> I MEAN CRITICS ARE SAYING,

249
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
LOOK, SHE'S BASICALLY BEEN

250
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
STITCHED UP HERE BY A LOT OF

251
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
OLDER GUYS IN THE REPUBLICAN

252
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
PARTY WHO HAVE LOOKED AT A

253
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
BRIGHT YOUNG WOMAN AND THOUGHT

254
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU OUT OF

255
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
HERE.

256
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
>> A BRIGHT YOUNG WOMAN WOULDN'T

257
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
HAVE MADE THAT STATEMENT.

258
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I BRIGHT YOUNG WOMAN WOULD HAVE

259
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
HAD ENOUGH INDEPENDENT

260
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
KNOWLEDGE, ENOUGH INDEPENDENT

261
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
JUDGMENT TO REALIZE SHE WAS
BEING FED A LOAD OF MULARKEY.

262
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
IN THE WORDS OF OUR VICE

263
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
PRESIDENT.

264
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
>> SHE'S CLEARLY BRIGHT, RUDY.

265
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
SHE'S NOT A STUPID WOMAN.

266
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
SHE'S A VERY INTELLIGENT WOMAN.

267
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
>> OBVIOUSLY NOT WITH ENOUGH

268
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
INFORMATION, NOT WITH ENOUGH

269
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
EXPERIENCE TO KNOW HOW TO

270
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
CRITICALLY ANALYZE INTELLIGENCE.

271
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
>> IF JOHN KERRY GETS THE JOB --

272
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD, FIRST OF

273
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
ALL?

274
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT?

275
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
>> WOULD I SUPPORT IT?

276
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
IF THE PRESIDENT WANTED JOHN

277
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
KERRY, I SEE NO REASON TO STAND

278
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
IN THE WAY OF JOHN KERRY AS

279
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
SECRETARY OF STATE.

280
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'M CERTAINLY IF I WERE

281
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
PRESIDENT NEVER SELECT JOHN

282
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
KERRY AS SECRETARY OF STATE.

283
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
>> WHY?

284
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
>> I THINK SOME PEOPLE IN OUR
MILITARY WILL HAVE A VERY HARD

285
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
TIME.

286
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE

287
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
HANOI HILTON LISTENING TO JOHN

288
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
KERRY ATTACKING AMERICA AND

289
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
ATTACKING AMERICAN SOLDIERS WILL

290
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THIS.

291
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
>> IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT OBAMA,

292
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
WHO WOULD YOU GO FOR?

293
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
>> WHAT I'M SAYING IS I'M NOT

294
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

295
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
ARE YOU SAYING TO ME IS THIS AN

296
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
ACCEPTABLE CHOICE WITHIN THE

297
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
REALM OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RIGHT

298
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
TO CHOOSE?

299
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
WHICH I BELIEVE IN VERY MUCH.

300
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
YES, THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE

301
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
CHOICE.

302
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
>> LET'S MOVE TO THE FISCAL

303
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
CLIFF, BECAUSE IT'S BECOME A

304
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
REAL PAIN IN THE BACK SIDE FOR

305
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
EVERYBODY REALLY AND EVERYBODY

306
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
IS WAITING FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE

307
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
TO BE AN INEVITABLE DEAL.

308
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
IT WOULD SEEM TODAY THAT JOHN

309
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
BOEHNER AND PRESIDENT OBAMA MET

310
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

311
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THAT'S A GOOD MOVE.

312
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
THEY HAVEN'T COME OUT ATTACKING

313
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
EACH OTHER, THAT'S ENCOURAGING.

314
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
ARE YOU LOOKING AT THIS AS A

315
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
PRE-CHRISTMAS DONE DEAL, RUDY?

316
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
>> I THINK SO, BECAUSE IT SEEMS

317
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
SO OBVIOUS THAT YOU HAVE TO DO

318
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
IT.

319
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I DIDN'T LIKE THE COMMENT THAT

320
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
THEY HAD A FRANK TALK.

321
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THAT REMINDS ME OF THE COLD WAR.

322
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
THAT'S WHEN KRUSCHEV AND KENNEDY

323
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
WOULD MEET AND THE NEXT THING

324
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
AFTER YOU SAID THEY HAD A FRANK

325
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
CONVERSATION, EVERYONE WENT INTO

326
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
SHELTERS AND SAID OH, MY GOD,

327
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT?

328
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
TO ME A DEAL IS DOABLE, BUT

329
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
YOU'VE GOT -- YOU HAVE TO

330
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
RECOGNIZE WHAT BOTH SIDES --

331
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
OBVIOUSLY THE PRESIDENT NEEDS A

332
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
HIKE IN TAXES.

333
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
>> AND THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN,

334
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
ISN'T IT?

335
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
LET'S BE HONEST, THE REPUBLICANS

336
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
HAVE LOST THAT ARGUMENT.

337
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
>> NOT ONLY HOW FAR, ARE THEY

338
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
GOING TO HAPPEN.

339
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
REPUBLICANS DON'T BELIEVE HE'LL

340
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
DO SPENDING CUTS.

341
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
SO HERE'S MY PROPOSAL, SEE WHAT

342
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
IT'S WORTH.

343
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
REPUBLICANS AGREE, SPLIT THE

344
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
DIFFERENCE.

345
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
REPUBLICANS AGREE TO JUMP THE
RATE FROM 35 TO 37 AND OTHER

346
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
SIMILAR KINDS OF JUMPS.

347
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
DEMOCRATS AGREE TO A TRILLION

348
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
DOLLARS, TRILLION AND A HALF

349
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
DOLLARS IN SPENDING CUTS.

350
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
THE SPENDING CUTS AND THE TAX

351
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
INCREASES GO INTO EFFECT AT THE

352
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
SAME TIME.

353
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT REPUBLICANS

354
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
ARE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT.

355
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT WE'LL GIVE

356
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
THEM THE TAX INCREASES, THEY'LL

357
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
SAY, DON'T WORRY, AND THEN A

358
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
YEAR FROM NOW THEY'LL BE VERY,

359
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
VERY FEW SPENDING DECREASES.

360
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
SO IF YOU COULD LINK THE TWO

361
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
THINGS TOGETHER AND SAY, OKAY,

362
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
WE CAN'T GET ALL THE SPENDING

363
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
REDUCTIONS DONE RIGHT NOW.

364
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
WE'LL AGREE ON A TAX INCREASE OF

365
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
A CERTAIN AMOUNT.

366
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
WE'LL AGREE ON SPENDING

367
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
DECREASES FOR REAL.

368
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
THEY GO INTO EFFECT JUNE 30th.

369
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
JUNE 30th BOTH THINGS HAPPEN.

370
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I DON'T SEE REPUBLICANS AGREEING

371
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
TO A TAX INCREASE WITHOUT

372
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
OPEN FOR 24 HOURS.

554
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
PLUS, IT REDUCES COPD FLARE-UPS.

555
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
SPIRIVA IS THE ONLY ONCE-DAILY

556
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
INHALED COPD MAINTENANCE
TREATMENT THAT DOES BOTH.

557
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
SPIRIVA HANDIHALER TIOTROPIUM
BROMIDE INHALATION POWDER

558
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
DOES NOT REPLACE FAST-ACTING
INHALERS FOR SUDDEN SYMPTOMS.

559
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU HAVE
KIDNEY PROBLEMS, GLAUCOMA,

560
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
TROUBLE URINATING, OR
AN ENLARGED PROSTATE.

561
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
THESE MAY WORSEN WITH SPIRIVA.

562
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
DISCUSS ALL MEDICINES
YOU TAKE, EVEN EYE DROPS.

563
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
STOP TAKING SPIRIVA AND SEEK
IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP

564
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
IF YOUR BREATHING
SUDDENLY WORSENS,

565
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
YOUR THROAT OR TONGUE
SWELLS, YOU GET HIVES,

566
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
VISION CHANGES OR EYE PAIN,
OR PROBLEMS PASSING URINE.

567
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
DRY MOUTH AND CONSTIPATION.

568
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
NOTHING CAN REVERSE COPD.

569
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
SPIRIVA HELPS ME BREATHE BETTER.

570
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
(BLOWING SOUND)

571
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT SPIRIVA.

572
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
>>> TODAY I MADE THE DECISION

573
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
THAT IT WAS THE BEST THING FOR

574
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
OUR COUNTRY, FOR THE AMERICAN

575
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
PEOPLE THAT I NOT CONTINUE TO BE

576
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
CONSIDERED BY THE PRESIDENT FOR

577
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
NOMINATION AS SECRETARY OF STATE

578
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE A

579
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
CONFIRMATION PROCESS THAT WAS

580
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
VERY PROLONGED, VERY

581
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
POLITICIZED.

582
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
>> AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE TELLING

583
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
NBC'S BRIAN WILLIAMS ON ROCK

584
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
CENTER WHY SHE WAS WITHDRAWING

585
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
HER NAME FOR SECRETARY OF STATE.

586
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
LET'S GET TO THE BATTLE IN

587
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
AMERICA.

588
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
WELCOME TO YOU BOTH.

589
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
>> THANKS FOR HAVING US.

590
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
>> LET ME START WITH YOU,

591
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
MARGARET HOOVER.

592
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
THIS WILL BE SEEN AS A BIG WIN

593
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
FOR THE OLD GUARD REPUBLICANS.

594
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I INTERVIEWED THE THREE AMIGOS
AS THEY CALL THEMSELVES THIS

595
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
WEEK, BUT I'M SURE SENATORS

596
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
McCAIN AND GRAHAM WILL SLEEP

597
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
EASY TONIGHT KNOWING THEY'VE

598
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
SEEN OFF THE CHALLENGE FROM

599
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
SUSAN RICE.

600
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
ARE THEY RIGHT TO BE PLEASED

601
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
ABOUT THIS?

602
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
>> I DON'T KNOW FOR THEM IF IT'S

603
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
AS MUCH PERSONALLY ABOUT HER OR

604
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
IF IT'S ABOUT BENGHAZI.

605
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
ALL THREE OF THEM DID

606
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
IMMEDIATELY TODAY MAKE

607
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
STATEMENTS SAYING WE WILL NOT

608
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
STOP THE SCRUTINY ON BENGHAZI

609
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
AND WHAT HER WITHDRAWAL DOES IS

610
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
STOP THE SCRUTINY OR THE

611
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
HEADLINES OF BENGHAZI.

612
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
>> THERE'S A FEAR THAT SHE'S

613
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
BASICALLY FALLEN ON HER SWORD

614
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO

615
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
BE A RESIGNATION LINKED TO

616
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
BENGHAZI AT SOME STAGE.

617
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
>> IT CERTAINLY WON'T BE HER.

618
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
BUT REMEMBER THE FOUNDATION

619
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
REALLY STARTED TO CRUMBLE ON

620
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
THIS WHEN THE LEFT STOPPED

621
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
SUPPORTING SUSAN RICE.

622
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
SO AS MUCH AS THE THREE AMIGOS

623
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
WERE OUT IN FRONT, MAUREEN DOWD

624
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
HAD CRITICAL, CRITICAL REVIEWS

625
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
OF HER, EZRA KLEIN, THE

626
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
ENVIRONMENTALIST MOVEMENT

627
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS WITH
HER.

628
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
>> THAT IS TRUE AND I DETECTED

629
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
THAT.

630
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
THERE WAS ALSO A SENSE WHEN SHE

631
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
WENT UP THERE TO SEE THE THREE

632
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
AMIGOS AND OTHERS, SHE REALLY

633
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
EMERGED LOOKING QUITE WEAKENED

634
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
AS IF SHE GOT INTO AN OBVIOUS

635
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
TRAP AND BEEN LASSOED ALL OVER

636
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
AGAIN.

637
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
IT JUST DIDN'T LOOK VERY SMART

638
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
POLITICS BY HER.

639
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
>> WELL, NO, I THINK SHE TOOK

640
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
ONE FOR THE TEAM.

641
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE ENTIRE

642
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
SITUATION HAS BECOME HIGHLY

643
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
POLITICIZED.

644
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
FRANKLY GIULIANI SAYING SHE MAY

645
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
NOT HAVE BEEN SHARP ENOUGH IS

646
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
WHOLLY UNFAIR AND I THINK IT

647
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
REALLY IS A TRAGEDY, BECAUSE SHE

648
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
REALLY, I WOULD SAY, IS THE BEST

649
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
WOMAN FOR THE JOB.

650
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
SHE WAS A TRUSTED ADVISER TO THE

651
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
PRESIDENT AND SHE HAS DONE MORE

652
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
IN TERMS OF PUTTING SANCTIONS

653
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
AGAINST IRAN, NORTH KOREA IN HER

654
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
CAPACITY AS AMBASSADOR.

655
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
IS TRULY A WOMAN WHO UNDERSTANDS

656
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
21st CENTURY DIPLOMACY AND

657
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
NATIONAL SECURITY.

658
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
AND WHAT SHE DID WAS GO AND READ

659
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
TALKING POINTS GIVEN TO HER BY

660
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
THE NATIONAL SECURITY STAFF AND

661
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
DID HER JOB.

662
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
HAD SHE GONE IN AND ASSERTED HER

663
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
OWN OPINIONS, HER OWN -- IT

664
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AS PLAYING

665
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
POLITICS, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN
OUT OF PLACE.

666
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
>> OKAY.

667
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
BUT MARGARET, WHETHER SHE'S THE

668
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB I THINK

669
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
IS A FAIRLY ARGUABLE POINT.

670
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I DON'T THINK SHE'S BEEN

671
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
MASSIVELY IMPRESSIVE IN THE LAST

672
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
FEW MONTHS.

673
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
SHE MISLED THE PUBLIC

674
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
DELIBERATELY BUT NOT MASSIVELY

675
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
IMPRESSIVE.

676
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
JOHN KERRY, I WOULD SAY, IS

677
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
PROBABLY A BETTER CANDIDATE,

678
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
JUST FROM MY DISPASSIONATE EYE.

679
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
>> HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE

680
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
MADE THE SAME MISTAKE SHE MADE.

681
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I THINK SENATOR CLINTON PROBABLY

682
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
SAID IT BEST WHEN SHE ACTUALLY

683
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
MADE EVERY INDICATION THAT SHE

684
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
FAVORS JOHN KERRY FOR THE

685
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
POSITION, NOT SECRETARY RICE.

686
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
HE IS WIDELY RESPECTED IN

687
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
WASHINGTON, WHETHER YOU LIKE HIS

688
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
-- HE'S BEEN HEAD OF THE FOREIGN

689
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
AFFAIRS COMMITTEE FOR YEARS AND

690
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
YEARS AND YEARS SO HE PROBABLY

691
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
DOES HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE.

692
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
NOT TO KNOCK SUSAN RICE'S

693
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY.

694
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT SENATOR

695
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
McCAIN WILL BE THRILLED WITH THE

696
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
FOREIGN POLICY THAT JOHN KERRY

697
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
RUNS ANY BETTER THAN SUSAN RICE.

698
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
IT WAS THE HANDLING OF THIS AND

699
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
THE HANDLING OF THE

700
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
ADMINISTRATION WITH BENGHAZI

701
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
THAT THIS BECAME THE SYMBOL OF.

702
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
>> LET'S MOVE TO THIS RATHER

703
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
DIFFICULT SITUATION THE

704
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
PRESIDENT FINDS HIMSELF IN WITH

705
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
THE TOP FOUR CABINET POSITIONS

706
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
COULD ALL BE FILLED BY MEN IT

707
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
NOW SEEMS, NO WOMEN AT ALL.

708
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
THAT'S NOT GREAT FOR A

709
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
PROGRESSIVE PRESIDENT LIKE

710
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
BARACK OBAMA, IS IT?

711
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
>> YEAH, NO.

712
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF GOOD
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THAT

713
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
PROSPECT.

714
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I THINK THE THING IS THERE IS I

715
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
DEEP ENOUGH BENCH OF FABULOUS

716
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
WOMEN THAT COULD FULFILL THESE

717
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
ROLES AND WE SURE WOULD LIKE TO

718
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
SEE THEM HOLD THOSE POSITIONS.

719
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
SUSAN RICE, I THINK IS NOT JUST

720
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
THE BEST WOMAN FOR THE JOB, I

721
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
THOUGHT SHE WAS THE BEST PERSON

722
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
FOR THE JOB.

723
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
IN TERMS OF JOHN KERRY BEING A

724
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
SAFE CHOICE, HE'S VANILLA AND

725
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
VANILLA IS ALWAYS A SAFE FLAVOR,

726
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
RIGHT?

727
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
BUT I WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY IT'S

728
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT IN

729
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
TERMS OF I THINK IT'S GOOD TO

730
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
HAVE THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE

731
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
JOB ALWAYS.

732
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH CHECKING

733
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
OUT THE PROSPECTS FOR SURE.

734
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
>>> LET'S TURN TO THE FISCAL

735
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
CLIFF, THE FRANK MEETING BETWEEN

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
>> WELL, FIRST, I'M AFRAID YOU

917
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
KNOW MORE ABOUT ME THAN I KNOW,

918
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
SO THAT'S MY FIRST CONCERN.

919
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK OF IT AS

920
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
BEING WARREN BUFFETT'S SON.

921
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
YOU KNOW, WE GREW UP, AS MANY

922
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
PEOPLE KNOW AND SOME PEOPLE

923
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
DON'T BELIEVE, IN A VERY MODEST

924
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
ENVIRONMENT.

925
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
AND I NEVER -- WE NEVER REALLY

926
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
WERE EVEN AWARE THAT MY DAD WAS

927
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
REALLY MAKING MONEY UNTIL

928
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
PROBABLY TOWARDS THE END OF

929
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
JUNIOR HIGH AND THEN INTO HIGH

930
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
SCHOOL.

931
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
AND THEN YOU'RE A LITTLE OLDER

932
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
AND YOU JUST TAKE IT AS IT

933
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
COMES.

934
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
BUT I'VE NEVER THOUGHT OF IT

935
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
THAT WAY.

936
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
>> WHAT I LOVE ARE THE LITTLE

937
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
TINY BITS OF TRIVIAL DETAIL

938
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM

939
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.

940
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
THERE'S A GREAT STORY THAT YOU

941
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
TELL ABOUT YOU ASKED YOUR FATHER

942
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
IF YOU COULD HAVE A CAR.

943
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
AND IN EXCHANGE HE SAID, RIGHT,

944
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
YOU CAN.

945
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY BIRTHDAY

946
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
OR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS FOR SOME

947
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
INDETERMINANT PERIOD.
HOW LONG WAS THE PERIOD?

948
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
>> THREE YEARS.

949
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
AND I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO GIVE

950
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
ME $5,000 AND I THOUGHT I COULD

951
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
GET THE CAR FOR $5,000 AND I WAS

952
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
$2500 SHORT.

953
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
THAT WAS A LOT OF MONEY.

954
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
>> HOW DID YOU FEEL?

955
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
DIDDY EVER NEARLY SUCCUMB TO THE

956
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
PRESSURE?

957
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
>> OH, NO, IT WAS A DEAL.

958
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
IN OUR HOUSEHOLD A DEAL IS A

959
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
DEAL.

960
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
>> WAS THERE A HANDSHAKE OR

961
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
FORMAL CONTRACT?

962
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
>> NO, THE HANDSHAKE WAS IT.

963
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
>> HAS YOUR DAD ALWAYS BEEN A

964
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
HANDSHAKE MAN?

965
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

966
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
HE'S MADE SOME OF THE BIGGEST

967
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
DEALS ANY BUSINESSMAN HAS EVER

968
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
MADE ON A HANDSHAKE.

969
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
>> AND YOU THE SAME?

970
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

971
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I MEAN IF YOU DON'T TRUST WHO

972
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
YOU'RE DOING A DEAL WITH, THEN

973
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING A DEAL.

974
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
A CONTRACT DOESN'T MAKE A BAD

975
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
GUY DO A GOOD DEAL.

976
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
SO YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT ON A

977
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
HANDSHAKE.

978
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
>> THE OTHER STORY I ABSOLUTELY

979
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
LOVED WAS AS A KID YOU TURNED

980
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
YOUR BACK YARD INTO A FARM AND

981
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
THAT'S BECOME YOUR GREAT PASSION

982
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
OR LOVE.

983
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
YOUR FATHER LATER BOUGHT LAND

984
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
FOR YOU AND CHARGED YOU RENT,

985
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
BUT THIS WAS THE TWIST.

986
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
HE TIED IT TO THE AMOUNT OF YOUR

987
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
BODY WEIGHT.

988
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
THE HIGHER YOUR WEIGHT, THE

989
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
HIGHER THE RENT.

990
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
DID IT WORK?

991
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
THIS COULD BE THE GREATEST DIET

992
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
THING IN HISTORY.

993
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
>> IT DIDN'T WORK.

994
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
AND HE WOULD TELL YOU IT DIDN'T
WORK.

995
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
YOU KNOW, SO WE MOVED ON TO THE

996
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
NEXT THING.

997
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
>> WHAT DID WORK OVER THE YEARS?

998
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
>> WELL, I THINK THE THINGS THAT

999
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
HAVE WORKED, I'M NOT SURE

1000
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
EXACTLY SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOU'RE
AFTER.

1001
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
>> WELL, HE MUST HAVE IMPARTED

1002
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
SO MUCH WISDOM TO YOU OVER THE

1003
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
YEARS.

1004
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
>> HE HAS BEEN AN AMAZING

1005
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
MENTOR.

1006
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I USED TO SIT -- I'M NOT SURE HE

1007
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
EVEN KNOWS I DID THIS.

1008
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
BUT I USED TO SIT IN A CHAIR OR

1009
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
ON THE COUCH OR SOMETHING IN THE
SAME ROOM.

1010
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
HE'S BE ON THE PHONE NEGOTIATING

1011
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
SOMETHING AND I'D JUST LISTEN TO

1012
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
HIM.

1013
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'D ONLY HEAR ONE SIDE OF THE

1014
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
CONVERSATION, BUT THAT WAS

1015
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
ENOUGH TO GET A GOOD IDEA OF

1016
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
WHAT HE WAS DOING OF THE AND I
MEAN IT WAS AN AMAZING

1017
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
EXPERIENCE.

1018
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
>> YOU HAVE THIS FOUNDATION

1019
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
INVOLVED VERY MUCH WITH HUNGER

1020
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
AND CHARITY WORK, YOU VISITED

1021
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
THE CONGO WITH BEN AFFLECK.

1022
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
OBVIOUSLY A PASSION OF YOURS.

1023
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
>> WELL, I JUST GOT BACK FROM

1024
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
EASTERN CONGO ABOUT FOUR DAYS

1025
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
AGO, THE SECOND TRIP IN FIVE

1026
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
WEEKS.

1027
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
CONGO IS AN AREA WHERE A LOT OF
PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE DEBATE

1028
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
WRONG.

1029
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I WILL TELL YOU, YOU'VE BEEN

1030
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
TALKING ALL ABOUT SUSAN RICE AND

1031
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I DON'T KNOW THE POLITICS OF
SUSAN RICE.

1032
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
SHE MADE A STATEMENT WHICH IS

1033
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
DEAD RIGHT, WHICH IS IF IT ISN'T

1034
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
THEM IN 23, IT WILL BE THEM.

1035
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
SINCE 1990 IT HAS NOT MOVED AND

1036
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
STILL HAS REMAINED AT THE BOTTOM

1037
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
OF THE U.N. INDEX FOR POVERTY

1038
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
AND HUMAN SUFFERING.

1039
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
SO -- AND IT RANKS ALMOST DEAD

1040
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
LAST AND MO ABRAMS INDEX NEXT TO

1041
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
SOMALIA.

1042
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I WAS IN SOMALIA ABOUT FIVE

1043
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
WEEKS AGO.

1044
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I TELL YOU, I CAN UNDERSTAND
THAT.

1045
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
SO IT'S A TOUGH PLACE, IT'S A

1046
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
TOUGH -- IT'S FULL OF ATROCITIES

1047
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.

1048
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
AND SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO SUPPORT

1049
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
THE GOVERNMENT OF DRC TO DO A

1050
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
BETTER JOB AND TO TAKE EASTERN

1051
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
CONGO AND TURN IT -- IT HAS

1052
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
INCREDIBLE MINERAL -- SOME OF

1053
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
THE ESTIMATES ARE $24 TRILLION

1054
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
OF WEALTH TO BRING OUT IN THE

1055
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
FUTURE.

1056
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
IT COULD BE A VERY RICH COUNTRY.

1057
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
>> LET'S TALK BRIEFLY THE FISCAL

1058
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
CLIFF.

1059
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
YOUR FATHER HAS BEEN VERY VOCAL

1060
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
ABOUT TAXES.

1061
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
HE SAYS COME ON, BRING IT TO ME,

1062
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
TAX ME MORE.

1063
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
OBVIOUSLY YOU'LL BE IN THE

1064
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
FIRING LINE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A

1065
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
POOR MAN, ARE YOU.

1066
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
ARE YOU HAPPY YOUR FATHER IS

1067
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
LEADING THIS CALL FOR YOU TO GET

1068
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
--

1069
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
>> NO, BECAUSE I HEAR FROM ALL

1070
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS WHO DON'T

1071
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
LIKE IT.

1072
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
YOU KNOW, THE FISCAL CLIFF, YOU

1073
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
TALK ABOUT IT, IT'S LIKE -- YOU

1074
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
KNOW, IT'S THE RESULT OF POOR

1075
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
BEHAVIOR.

1076
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED.

1077
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
YOU KNOW, ON THE OTHER HAND THE

1078
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
WORLD DOESN'T END TOMORROW IF WE

1079
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
GO OFF THE CLIFF.

1080
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
COKE SELLS COCA-COLA, BURLINGTON

1081
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
NORTHERN HAULS FREIGHT.

1082
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I WILL TELL YOU, I THINK OF THE

1083
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
FISCAL CLIFF A LITTLE
DIFFERENTLY.

1084
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I PUT IT -- I THINK IT'S

1085
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
RELATIVE TO THE WORLD.

1086
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
EVERYBODY IN THE EASTERN CONGO

1087
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
GETS UP AND THEY'RE FALLING OFF

1088
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
THE FISCAL CLIFF EVERY MORNING

1089
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
WHEN THEY GET OUT OF BED TRYING

1090
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY CAN FEED

1091
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
THEIR CHILD LIVING ON $1 A DAY

1092
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
OR HALF A DOLLAR A DAY.

1093
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
SO I THINK IT'S ALL RELATIVE.

1094
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
AND THE WORLD DOESN'T END.

1095
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT GOING

1096
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
OFF THE CLIFF ISN'T THE SLAP IN

1097
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
THE FACE WE NEED TO SAY, FOLKS,

1098
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
WE NEED TO DO BETTER.

1099
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
>> WOULD YOU BE HAPPY TO PAY

1100
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
MORE TAX?

1101
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
>> I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO PAY
MORE TAX.

1102
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I TELL YOU WHAT I THINK IT

1103
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
AMOUNTS TO.

1104
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
WHEN MY DAD STARTED TALKING

1105
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
ABOUT THIS I STARTED PAYING

1106
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
ATTENTION TO WHAT TAX I PAID.

1107
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'M IN THE 35% TAX BRACKET.

1108
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
BUT I WENT BACK AND FIGURED IT

1109
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
OUT -- I SHOULD SAY MY WIFE WENT

1110
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
BACK AND FIGURED IT OUT, SHE DID

1111
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
ALL THE WORK.

1112
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
YOU KNOW WHAT, WE PAID JUST

1113
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
UNDER 24% ON AN AVERAGE ACROSS

1114
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
THE FIVE YEARS.

1115
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I THINK IF PEOPLE PAID WHAT THEY

1116
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
ARE SUPPOSED TO PAY WITHIN THE

1117
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
TAX BRACKET, YOU DON'T HAVE TO

1118
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
RAISE TAXES.

1119
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
>> FINAL QUESTION, WHAT ON EARTH

1120
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
DO YOU BUY WARREN BUFFETT FOR

1121
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
CHRISTMAS?

1122
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
>> NOW YOU'VE PUT ME ON THE

1123
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
SPOT.

1124
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
YOU KNOW, I THINK --

1125
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
>> DO YOU GO BIG, DO YOU GO

1126
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
SMALL?

1127
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
>> YOU GO WITH ANY IDEA YOU

1128
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
HAVE.

1129
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
>> WHAT DID YOU GET HIM LAST

1130
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
YEAR?

1131
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
>> OH, MY GOSH, I'M TRYING TO

1132
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
REMEMBER WHAT I GOT HIM LAST
YEAR.

1133
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I TELL YOU WHAT I GIVE HIM FOR

1134
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
CHRISTMAS, YOU'LL LIKE THIS.

1135
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
WHAT I GIVE HIM FOR CHRISTMAS IS

1136
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I WAIT AND I HAND HIM MY RENT

1137
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
CHECK FOR THE FARM AT CHRISTMAS

1138
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
TIME.

1139
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
THAT'S WHAT I DO EVERY YEAR.

1140
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
HE LOVES IT, HE TAKES IT.

1141
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1142
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I'M GOING TO GET YOU BACK ONE

1143
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
DAY WITH YOUR FATHER AND MAYBE

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
YOUR SON AS WELL, THREE

1145
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
GENERATIONS.

1146
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
>> I WOULD LOVE THAT.

1147
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.

1148
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
>> YOU BET.

1149
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000

ECHOLS.

1153
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
>> THE MEDIA PORTRAYS THIS IMAGE

1154
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
TO SOCIETY THAT DEATH ROW IS

1155
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
FULL OF CRIMINAL GENIUS HANNIBAL

1156
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
LECTER TYPES AND IT'S NOT THE

1157
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
CASE.

1158
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I'VE BEEN TAKING A MULTIVITAMIN
FOR YEARS. CENTRUM SILVER.

1159
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
BOTH OF US ACTUALLY.

1160
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
OUR PHARMACIST
RECOMMENDED IT.

1161
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
AND THAT MAKES ME FEEL
PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT.

1162
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
AND THEN I HEARD ABOUT A STUDY
LOOKING AT MULTIVITAMINS

1163
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
AND THE LONG TERM
HEALTH BENEFITS.

1164
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

1165
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
THEY USED CENTRUM SILVER
IN THE STUDY.

1166
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
MAKES ME FEEL EVEN BETTER,
THAT'S WHAT I TAKE.

1167
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
SORRY, WE TAKE.

1168
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
[ Male Announcer ] CENTRUM.

1169
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000

ALWAYS YOUR MOST COMPLETE.

TRY RUNNING FOUR.NING
A RESTAURANT IS HARD,

1173
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
FORTUNATELY WE'VE GOT INK.

1174
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
IT GIVES US 5X THE REWARDS

REWARDS WE PUT RIGHT
BACK INTO OUR BUSINESS.

1178
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
THIS IS THE ONLY THING
WE'VE EVER WANTED TO DO

1179
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000

1182
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Drug and alcohol abuse is up.

1183
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And those dealing with grief
don't have access to the

1184
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
professional help they need.

1185
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
When you see these issues, do
you want to walk away or
step up?

1186
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
With a degree in the field of
Counseling or Psychology from

the knowledge to make

COOK WHAT YOU LOVE,
AND SAVE YOUR MONEY.

BUT HE'LL WORK HIS WAY UP

HE'LL START INVESTING EARLY,

1196
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
HE'LL FIND SOME GOOD PEOPLE
TO HELP GUIDE HIM,

1197
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
AND HE'LL SET MONEY ASIDE
FROM HIS FIRST DAY OF WORK

1198
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
TO HIS LAST,

1199
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
WHICH ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE.

1200
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.

1201

FROM TD AMERITRADE.

1202
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000

STILL OVERWHELMED.

1204
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
YOU KNOW, YOU KIND OF HAVE TO

1205
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT I

1206
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
SPENT ALMOST THE PAST DECADE IN

1207
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000

1211
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000

>> IT WAS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.

1237
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
YOU KNOW, I REALLY DIDN'T EVEN

1238
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
HAVE AN IDEA HOW DIFFICULT IT

1239
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
WAS GOING TO BE.

1240
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
FOR THE FIRST AT LEAST THREE

1241
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
MONTHS THAT I WAS OUT, I WAS IN

1242
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
A STATE OF EXTREME SHOCK AND

1243
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
TRAUMA.

1244
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING BY MYSELF

OR FOR MYSELF.

1246
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I NEEDED SOMEONE WITH ME

1247
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
CONSTANTLY.

1248
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I JUST -- IT WAS LIKE A COMPLETE
AND ABSOLUTE SHOCK TO THE

1249
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
SYSTEM.

1250
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
>> WHAT ARE THE PHYSICAL SIDE

1251
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
EFFECTS THAT YOU STILL -- YOU'RE

1252
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
WEARING DARK GLASSES.

1253
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
CLEARLY YOU STILL HAVE

1254
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
SENSITIVITY FOR YOUR EYES, NOT

1255
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
HAVING NATURAL SUNLIGHT FOR

1256
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
YEARS.

>> YEAH.
>> WHAT ELSE?

I STILL HAVE A LOT OF KIDNEY

1263
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
ISSUES BECAUSE I WAS BEATEN

1264
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
PRETTY BAD AT ONE POINT.

1265
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF DENTAL

1266
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
ISSUES, WHICH THANKFULLY I'VE

1267
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000

DO YOU THINK HE'S BEEN COPING?

1273
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, IT'S AMAZING TO

1274

HAVE HIM OUT HERE WITH US.

1275

BUT IT'S TRUE, NO ONE COULD

1276
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000

1277
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000

1278
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000

1281
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
ALL OF THAT THAT HE WAS DEALING

1282

WITH FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS.

1283
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
AFTER THAT, IT'S JUST BEEN A

1284
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
PROCESS.

1285
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
BUT IT'S -- THERE'S NO

1286
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
PRECEDENT.
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO PLACE,

1287
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
THERE'S NO GUIDE BOOK OR

1288
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
ANYTHING TO KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1289
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK HAVE BEEN
THE HARDEST THINGS FOR DAMIEN TO

1290
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
DEAL WITH?

1291
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
>> IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS, LIKE

1292
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
GOING TO THE BANK AND FILLING

1293
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
OUT A DEPOSIT SLIP OR GOING

1294

THROUGH SECURITY AT THE AIRPORT.

1295

IT'S THE ANXIETY THAT I DIDN'T

1296

UNDERSTAND IS JUST HUGE FOR HIM.

1297
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
JUST THE DAY-TO-DAY LIFE.

1298
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
>> IT'S QUITE AN EXTRAORDINARY

1299
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
STORY.

1300
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I WAS GRIPPED BY IT WHEN I DID

1301

THE PREVIOUS INTERVIEW.

1302
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000

1303

JUSTICE FOR THESE MEN.

1304
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
WHAT WAS IT THAT APPEALED TO YOU

1305
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
FROM A DOCUMENTARY MAKER

1306
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
POINTING OF VIEW?

1307
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
>> WELL, THE STORY HAD SO MANY

1308
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
TWISTS AND TURNS BUT AT THE END

1309
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
OF THE DAY THERE WAS A MAN ON

1310
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
DEATH ROW AND TWO SERVING LIFE

1311

1312

DIDN'T DO.

1313
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I THINK THE MOST GRIPPING THING

1314
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
WAS THAT THEY WERE CONVICTED AS

1315
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
IF THEY PERPETRATED THESE

1316
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000

JOHN WITH THE KNIFE AND THE LEG.

1334
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000

ACTUALLY THROWN IN THE LAKE A

HAPPENED AND IT ACTUALLY WAS

DOCUMENTARY UNRAVELS IS THAT

1356
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
THESE WOUNDS WERE MUCH MORE
LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY

1357
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000

HOSPITALITY IS INCREDIBLE.

00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
THANKS, KAREN.

1451
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
LOVE YOUR MISSISSIPPI OUTDOORS.

00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I VOTE FOR YOUR
FLORIDA BEACHES, DAWN.

1453
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
BILL, THIS LOUISIANA
SEAFOOD IS DELICIOUS.

1454
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
WE'RE HAVING SUCH A
GREAT YEAR ON THE GULF,

1455
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
WE'VE DECIDED TO PUT
ASIDE OUR RIVALRY.

00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME TO
VISIT ANYONE OF OUR STATES.

1457
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
THE BEACHES AND WATERS
COULDN'T BE MORE BEAUTIFUL.

1458
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
TAKE A BOAT RIDE, GO FISHING
OR JUST LAY IN THE SUN.

1459
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
WE'VE GOT COASTLINE TO EXPLORE
AND WILDLIFE TO PHOTOGRAPH.

1460
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
AND THERE'S WORLD CLASS DINING
WITH OUR WORLD FAMOUS SEAFOOD.

1461
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
SO FOR A GREAT VACATION
THIS YEAR, COME TO THE GULF.

1462
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
ITS ALL FABULOUS BUT
I GIVE FLORIDA THE EDGE.

1463
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
RIGHT AFTER MISSISSIPPI.

1464
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
YOU MEAN ALABAMA.

1465
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
SAY LOUISIANA OR
THERE'S NO DESSERT.

1466
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
THIS INVITATION IS
BROUGHT TO YOU BY BP

1467
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000

00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
ECHOLS GUILTY OF CAPITAL MURDER

IN THE DEATH OF STEVIE BRANCH,

1471
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
CHRIS BIERS AND MICHAEL MOORE.

1472
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
>> THE VERDICT THAT SENT DAMIEN

1473
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
ECHOLS TO DEATH ROW.

1474
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
THEY WERE RELEASED LAST YEAR I'M

1475
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
BACK WITH DAMIEN, HIS WIFE AND

1476
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
THE DIRECTOR AMY BERG.

1477
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
THE DOCUMENTARY, YOU CAN'T WATCH

1478
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
THAT WITHOUT SHAKING YOUR HEAD

1479
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
REALLY ABOUT THE LIFE THAT

1480
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
HAPPENED FOR YOU FOR NEARLY TWO

1481
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
DECADES.

1482
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
IT'S A COMPLETELY WASTED LIFE

1483
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
UNTIL THE STAGE OF WHERE YOU ARE

1484
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
NOW.

1485
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
REALLY SHOCKING.

1486
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
THE OTHER SHOCKING THING, OF

1487
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
COURSE, YOU COULD HAVE BEEN

1488
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
EXECUTED BY NOW.

1489
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
>> RIGHT.

1490
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
>> 53 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXECUTED

1491
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
SINCE YOU WERE RELEASED.

1492
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
11 IN 2011, 42 THIS YEAR.

1493
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
WHEN YOU HEAR THAT, GIVEN YOUR

1494
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE OF

1495
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
DEATH ROW, GIVEN WHAT WE NOW

1496
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
KNOW ABOUT DNA AND THE WAY IT'S

1497
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
BEEN EXONERATING MANY PEOPLE ON

1498
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
DEATH ROW, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
IT?

1499
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
>> IT'S ABSOLUTELY NIGHTMARISH.

1500
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF CASES

1501
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
OUT THERE THAT DON'T HAVE DNA

1502
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
THAT THE PEOPLE COULD VERY WELL

1503
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
BE INNOCENT AND EVEN IF THEY'RE

1504
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
NOT, YOU KNOW, MEDIA SORT OF

1505
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
PORTRAYS THIS IMAGE TO SOCIETY

1506
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
THAT DEATH ROW IS FULL OF, YOU

1507
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
KNOW, CRIMINAL GENIUS HANNIBAL

1508
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
LECTER TYPE AND THEY ARE NOT.

1509
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
THEY SAY THEY DON'T EXECUTE THE

1510
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
MENTALLY INSANE OR MENTALLY

1511
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
HANDICAP AND THEY DO.

1512
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
>> HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU

1513
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
ENCOUNTER ON DEATH ROW THAT YOU

1514
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
BASICALLY BELIEVE MAY HAVE BEEN

1515
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
INNOCENT?

1516
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
>> I WOULD SAY IN THE TIME WAYS

1517
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
THERE PROBABLY THREE OTHERS.

1518
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
ONE WAS EXECUTED, PROBABLY WILL

1519
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
BE EXECUTED IN THE UPCOMING

1520
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
YEAR.

1521
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
ONE HAS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF

1522
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
GETTING OUT DUE TO THE FACT THAT

1523
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
THERE HAS BEEN A LITTLE MEDIA

1524
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
INTEREST IN HIS CASE.

1525
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
>> WHAT DNA EVIDENCE HAD IT BEEN

1526
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
AROUND WHEN YOU WERE ARRESTED,

1527
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
HAVE CLEARED YOU FROM THE START?

1528
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1529
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO CONVICT

1530
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
US SO BADLY.

1531
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
WE HAD OTHER THINGS LIKE ALIBIS,

1532
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
PEOPLE THAT COULD TESTIFY TO

1533
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
WHERE WE WERE AT THE TIME AND

1534
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
CAN PLAINLY PROVE THAT WE

1535
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
WEREN'T AT THE CRIME SCENE.

1536
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
THEY SEEN HAVE JESSE MESCELLI

1537
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
SIGNING A LOG BOOK AND PHOTOS

1538
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
ABOUT HIM.

1539
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
SO TECHNICALLY IT IS POSSIBLE

1540
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
THAT THEY COULD HAVE SHOWED THEM

1541
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
THE DNA AND THEY WERE SO ENRAGED

1542
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
AT THE TIME THAT THEY WOULD HAVE

1543
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
CONVICTED US ANYWAY.

1544
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
>> HAVE YOU TATTOOS THAT YOU

1545
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
DIDN'T HAVE LAST TIME.

1546
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
WHAT DO ME MEAN?

1547
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
>> IT HELPS ME DEAL.

1548
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
IT IS VERY PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND

1549
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
EMOTIONALLY SOOTHING TO ME.

1550
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
IT IS ALSO LIKE PUTTING ON A

1551
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
SUIT OF ARMOR.

1552
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
LIKE IT GIVES YOU SOME SORT OF

1553
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
LEVEL OF -- LIKE A BUFFER ZONE

1554
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
BETWEEN YOU AND THE REST OF THE
WORLD.

1555
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
>> WHAT ARE THE ONES ON YOUR

1556
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
KNUCKLES?

1557
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
>> THESE ARE RUINS.

1558
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
USUALLY WHEN I GET TATTOOS I GET

1559
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
SOMETHING MEANINGFUL TO ME.

1560
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
LIKE I SAID, IT IS A SUIT OF

1561
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
ARMOR SO I LOOK TO PUT ON A SUIT
OF ARMOR MADE OUT OF THINGS I

1562
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
LOVE.

1563
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
LIKE WINTER, SNOW, ARCH ANGEL

1564
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
MICHAEL.
SOMETHING THAT MEANS SOMETHING

1565
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
TO ME PERSONALLY.

1566
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
>> DO YOU STAY IN TOUCH WITH

1567
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
JASON AND JESSE?

1568
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
>> JASON AND I, I HATE MORE THAN

1569
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
ANYTHING TALKING ON THE PHONE.

1570
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
BUT WE WILL TEXT.

1571
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
JESSE, FROM WHAT I HEARD,

1572
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
DOESN'T HAVE MUCH CONTACT WITH

1573
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
ANYONE.

1574
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
HE ONLY HAD A 68 IQ TO BEGIN

1575
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
WITH AND THEN YOU DUMP ON THIS.

1576
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
THEY MADE SURE HE WON'T LIVE

1577
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
ANYTHING REMOTELY RESEMBLING A

1578
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
NORMAL LIFE.

1579
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
AND HE IS A SHUT-IN.

1580
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
>> IT IS A HEART BREAKING STORY,

1581
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
AS WELL AS SHOCKING STORY.

1582
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
THESE ARE THREE LIVED VIRTUALLY

1583
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
RUINS AND MAYBE IN JESSE'S CASE,

1584
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
COMPLETELY RUINED.

1585
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
>> I FELL LIKE WEST OF MEMPHIS

1586
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
IS A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY AND I

1587
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
FEEL LIKE WE HAD BEAUTIFUL

1588
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO THE INSIDE

1589
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
STORY OF THE INVESTIGATION AND

1590
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
THE LOVE STORY AND I FEEL LIKE,

1591
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
THAT'S THE HAPPY ENDING THAT

1592
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR IN THIS

1593
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
STORY.

1594
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
IS TO SEE HOW IT ACTUALLY

1595
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
HAPPENED THAT THEY ALL CAME OUT.

1596
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
>> THIS IS THE WORST THING ABOUT

1597
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH, IS

1598
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE

1599
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
STILL SAY, WELL, THERE'S NO

1600
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE.

1601
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
THEY HAVEN'T CAUGHT THE REAL

1602
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
KILLER.

1603
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
THIS IS THE TERRIBLE STIGMA YOU

1604
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
CARRY WITH YOU.

1605
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
>> IT IS.

1606
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
AND IT WILL HANG OVER OUR HEADS.

1607
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I HATE TALKING ABOUT THIS.
HAVING TO TALK ABOUT THE CASE

1608
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
DAY AFTER DAY.

1609
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
IT IS ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE TO

1610
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
ME.

1611
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE, IMAGINE

1612
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
HAVING TO TALK ABOUT THE WORST

1613
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU

1614
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

1615
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IF WE

1616
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
DON'T KEEP DOING IT, WE WILL

1617
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
HAVE THAT STIGMA HANGING OVER

1618
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
OUR HEADS.

1619
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
WE HAVE TO KEEP LETTING THE

1620
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
STATE OF ARKANSAS KNOW WE'RE NOT

1621
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL YOU DO THE

1622
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
RIGHT THING.

1623
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
>> HOW IMPORTANT TO YOU AND

1624
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
POWERFUL TO YOU HAS IT BEEN TO

1625
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000

HER.

1630
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
WHEN I CON TAKE ANOTHER STEP

1631
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
WHEN I FELT LIKE I COULDN'T GO
ON, IT WAS HER.

1632
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
SHE IS WHAT WOULD CARRY ME

1633
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
FORWARD, MENTALLY, EMOTIONALLY,

1634
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000

IT IS A VERY POWERFUL FILM.

1641
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I URGE PEOPLE TO SEE IT.

1642
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
THEY STILL HAVE NO REAL IDEA

1643
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT, AND TO

1644
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
UNDERSTAND JUST HOW FAR YOU'VE

1645
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000

1646
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000

1652
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
(Announcer) When Subaru owners
look in the mirror,

1653
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
they see more than themselves.

1654
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,000
So we celebrate our year-end
with the "share the love" event.

1655
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Get a great deal on a new Subaru

1656
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
and 250 dollars goes to your
choice of five charities.

1657
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
By the end of this, our fifth
year,

1658
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
our total can reach almost 25
million dollars.

all.

talk about the options on the...

1663
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
table and what they mean for you
and your family.

1664
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
ANCR: AARP is cutting through
all the political spin.

1665
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Because for our 37 million
members, only one word counts.

1666

Get the facts at earnedasay.org.
Let's keep Medicare...

1667
