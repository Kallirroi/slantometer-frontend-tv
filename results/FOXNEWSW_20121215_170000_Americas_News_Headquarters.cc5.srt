YOU HAVE THE SAME PROCEDURE

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
WITH A SINGLULAR HOMICIDE

155
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
REGARDS IF THE PUBLIC KNOWS.

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
THIS IS MULTIPLE HOMICIDE

157
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
VICTIMS AND YOU HAVE TO

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000

159
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
EVIDENCE.

160
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
AND THE ENTOUR SEASON IS

161
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
MEASURED AND GRAPPED AND PUT

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
ON PAPER MUCH LIKE A DRAFTS

163
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
MAN WOULD CREATE.

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000

165
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
SINGLE PIECE OF EVIDENCE.

166
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
AND THE DOCUMENTED IN THERE

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
POSITION .

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
THERE IS FORENSIC.

169
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
AND BALLISTIC AND CASINGS ON

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
THE THERE ARE.

171
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
AND BULLIES THAT DAMAGED THEM

172
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
IN THE FLOOR AND WALL.

173
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
IT HAS TO UPON DOCUMENTED AND

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
WHY KNOW THE METHOD OF THE

175
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
UPON THOSE HAVE BEEN RECOVERED

176
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
AND IT SPEARS NO OTHERS ARE

177
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
LARGE.
ITS HAD TO BE DONE THIS WAY

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
NOT ONLY FOR FUTURE HISTORY.

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
BUT THIS IS THE WAY IT IS DONE

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
AND SADLY, I THINK EVERY

181
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
DETECTIVE AND COP ON THE JOB

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
VERY LONG IN ANY PLACE WHERE

183
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THERE IS VIOLENCE, KNOWS WHAT

184
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
IT LOOKS LIKE.

185
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
THAT IS DISTURBING.

186
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
>> IT IS IT DISTURBING INDEED,

187
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
MARK.
ESPECIALLY FOR THE POLICE

188
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
OFFICERS AND DETECTIVES

189
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
WORKING IN NEWTOWN,

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000

THIS IS NOT THE INNER STAVE

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
LOS ANGELES OR CHICAGO .

202
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000

220
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
THIS GUY GAIN ENTRY FORCIBLY.

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
AND WHEN A SCHOOL DID

222
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
EVERYTHING RIGHT TO DEFEND

223
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000

224
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
HOW DO YOU RECOMMEND PROGRAMS

225
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
TO PROTECT ONE'S STOUNT.

226
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000

MORE THAN THE NORMAL HIGH

234
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000

236
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000

IT IS APPROPRIATE TO THE

666
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
QUESTION OF WHY.

667
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE OPEN

668
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000

669
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000

681
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000

685
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000

HO HO HO!

762
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I just served my mother-in-law
your Chicken Noodle soup

763
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
but she loved it so much...
I told her it was homemade.

764
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Everyone tells
a little white lie now and then.

765
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
But now she wants
my recipe

766
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000

[ Male Announcer ] Progresso.
You gotta taste this soup.

768
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But when I was in an accident...
[ clears his throat ]
[ softly ]
She's right behind me isn't she?

769
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I was worried the
health care system

770
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
spoke a language all its own

771
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
With UnitedHealthcare,
I got help that fit my life.

772
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
So I never missed a beat.

801
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
NOW UNFORTUNELY BECAUSE WE

THE PAST.

808
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
SOMETIMES YOU DO HAVE POLICE

OFFICERS OR OTHER SECURITY

810
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
THEY DO LOOK AT NINE TIME TIME

812
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000

NATIONS SHOULD DO TO KEEP

JAMES BRADY ROOM.

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN.

823
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE

824
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
ECHOING THAT SAME SENTIMENT.

825
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
ALEN WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?

826
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
>> EVERYBODY IS TAKING A DEEP

827
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
BREATH AND TRYING TO PROCESS

828
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
WHAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE JUMPING

829
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
IN TO WHAT SHOULD WE DO OR

830
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
SHOULDN'T WE DO.
WE ARE TALK BEING PUBLIC

831
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
POLICY.

832
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I KNOW THERE ARE MICHAEL

833
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
BLOOMBERG THAT WAS CRITICAL

834
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
FROM THE PRESIDENT FROM THE

835
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
LEFT ABOUT NOT FOC ING ENOUGH

836
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
ON THIS ISSUE.

837
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
BUT WE AS A NATION WANT TO

838
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
CATCH OUR BREATH.

839
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE

840
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
TALKED ABOUT WAS THE NOTION OF

841
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
PERHAPS HAVING MORE GUARDS AT

842
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
SCHOOL.

843
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I WOULDN'T PLIND IF MY

844
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
TAXPAYER DOLLARS WENT TO

845
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
HAVING MORE PERSONNEL AT

846
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
SCHOOLS THAT WERE IN A GUARD

847
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
SITUATION.
YOU HAVE TO WONDER,

848
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS COMES

849
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
IN COULD THIS BE PREVENTED.

850
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
HE FORCED HIS WAY IN WE FOUND

851
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
OUT THIS MORNING.

852
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
WE ARE TRYING TO GET OUR HEAD

853
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
AROUND HOW WE COPE AS A

854
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
NATION.
>> MONICA, YOU CAN WRITE LAWS

855
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
ALL YOU WANT IN WASHINGTON AND

856
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
HAVING POLICE OFFICERS TO

857
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
ENFORCE, BUT HOW DOES CONGRESS

858
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
MOVE THE BALL FORWARD IN

859
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
TRYING TO PREVENT THE

860
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
TRAGEDIES FROM UNFOLDING.

861
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
IF PEOPLE ARE HELL BENT ON

862
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
DESTROYING PEOPLE, THEY CAN DO

863
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
IT.

864
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

865
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
IT GOES BACK TO THE BEGINNING

866
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
OF MANCOINED AND THE FIRST

867
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
MURDER WITH CAIN AND ABEL.

868
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
>> IT EXIST. WE CAN TRY TO

869
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
LIMIT THESE KINDS OF INCIDENTS

870
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
THROUGH INTERVENTION AND

871
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
CERTAIN LEGISLATION .

872
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE YOU CAN'T

873
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
PREVENT IT.

874
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
IT IS IT THE SAD TRUTH ABOUT

875
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
LIFE .

876
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO TRY TO

877
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
LOOK AT A BIGGER EXMANATION

878
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
WHETHER IT IS IT THE CULTURE

879
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
OR MOVIES OR AND SOMETIMES

880
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
MOST SIMPLE EXPLANATION ISLET

881
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
EXPLANATION THAT THERE ARE

882
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
PEOPLE PROCESSED BY EVIL AND

883
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
THEY WANT TO COMMIT AN

884
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
UNSPEAKABLE ACT THEY WILL DO

885
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
IT AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT

886
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
SOCIETY CAN DO THOOTO PREVENT

887
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
IT WE CAN TRY TO LIMIT AND

888
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
MITIGATE THIS AND VENE, BUT IT

889
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
IS NEVER FOOL PROOF.

890
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
THAT IS IT A TRUISM OF LIFE

891
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
UNFORTUNATELY.

892
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
NLET ME JUMP IN HERE.

893
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
BUT ALEN, COULDN'T WE BE GOING

894
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
TO THE OTHER EXTREME?

895
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
CERTAINLY SCHOOLS ARE SUPPOSED

896
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
TO BE A SAFE HAVEN FOR OUR

897
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
CHILDREN.

898
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
AND A PLACE WHERE THEY ARE

899
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
SUPPOSED TO FEEL THEY CAN

900
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
REACH THE POTENTIAL IN A

901
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
POSITIVE AND HAPPY WAY THROUGH

902
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
A SAFE ENVIRONMENT.

903
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
WHAT MESSAGE DO YOU THINK IT

904
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
WOULD SEND IF WE POSTED GUARDS

905
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
AT ENTRY WAY AND GUNS AND

906
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
METAL DETECTORS IN EACH

907
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
SCHOOL.

908
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
NWE HAVE THEM IN AIRPLANES AND

909
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
FEDERAL BUILDINGS AND OTHER

910
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
PLACES.
I DON'T KNOW THRATHEY WOULD

911
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
OBJECT THEY WERE PROTECTED.

912
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
WE FEEL SAFER.

913
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
AND CERTAIN THINGS THAT THE

914
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
NRA WITH.
AND ALL SIDES CAN CONCUR ON.

915
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
SAFETY LOCKS ON GOOD AND

916
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
NATIONAL REGISTRY.

917
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
AND MORE QUICKLY, WE HAVE THE

918
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
TECHNOLOGY TO KNOW IF SOMEONE

919
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
GOES TO BUY A GUN.

920
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
AND THE ISSUE OF MENTAL

921
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
HEALTH, WHAT CAN WE DO TO

922
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
ADDRESS MENTAL HETTLE AND

923
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
TAKEAWAY THE STIGMA ON THOSE

924
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

925
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
THEY NEED TO COME FORWARD.

926
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
>> AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

927
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
