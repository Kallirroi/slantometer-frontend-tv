00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
INCONCEIVABLE.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
THERE ARE NO SHORTAGE OF WORDS

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
TO DESCRIBE THE TRAGEDY THAT

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
STRUCK AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
RIGHT HERE IN NEWTOWN,

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
CONNECTICUT TODAY.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
BUT WE'VE HEARD ONE WORD

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN --

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
WHY.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
ABC'S CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
REPORTER BRIAN ROSS HAS SPENT

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
THE DAY UNCOVERING DETAILS ABOUT

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
THE 20-YEAR-OLD SHOOTER.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
BRIAN?

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
>> CYNTHIA, HE WAS ARMED TO THE

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
TEETH WITH LEGALLY PURCHASED

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
GUNS AND WENT FROM OBSCURITY TO

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
INFAMY.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
UNTIL TODAY, ADAM LANZA WAS

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
KNOWN MOSTLY IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
AS SOMEONE WHO DID NOT PLAY WELL

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
WITH OTHERS.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
ADAM LANZA WAS A CHILD OF AN

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
AFFLUENT CONNECTICUT TOWN AND
THE CHILD OF DIVORCE.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
A FAMILY FRIEND, BARBARA FREY,

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
TOLD ABC'S JIM AVILA THAT THE

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
SON WAS TROUBLED AND THE MOTHER

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
WAS DEMANDING OF HIM.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
>> HE WAS NOT CONNECTED WITH THE

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
OTHER KIDS.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
MY SON PLAYED WITH HIM WHEN THEY

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
WERE YOUNG.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
AND IN HER HOME, I KNOW SHE WAS
VERY PARTICULAR.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I JUST THINK SHE MAYBE HAD TOO

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
HIGH OF STANDARDS OR SOMETHING.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
OR FOCUSED ONLY TOO MUCH FOR

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
WHATEVER REASON.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
>> SO WAS THERE CONFLICT?

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
WAS THERE SOME KIND OF TENSION

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM?

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
PARENT AND CHILD?

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
>> NOT THAT I KNOW OF, BUT I
THINK THE FACT THAT THE PARENTS

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
WERE DIVORCED MUST HAVE

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
CONTRIBUTED TO IT.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
>> Reporter: TONIGHT, ADAM'S

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
BROTHER RYAN AND HIS FATHER

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
PETER, A GE TAX LAWYER, WERE

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
QUESTIONED BY THE FBI AND POLICE

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
IN NEW JERSEY.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
LOOKING FOR CLUES AS TO WHAT LED

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
THE YOUNGEST MEMBER OF THE

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
FAMILY TO KILL.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
SOMEONE BELIEVED TO BE RYAN

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
LANZA LEFT THE STATION TONIGHT
WITHOUT COMMENT.

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
>> I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
THING TO POINT OUT WITH THIS

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
KIND OF AN INDIVIDUAL IS THAT HE

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
DID NOT SNAP JUST THIS MORNING

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
AND DECIDE TO ACT OUT VIOLENTLY.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
THESE CRIMES INVOLVE PLANNING

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
AND THOUGHTFULNESS AND

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
STRATEGIZING IN ORDER TO PUT THE
PLAN TOGETHER.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
SO WHAT MAY APPEAR TO BE SNAP

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
BEHAVIOR IS NOT THAT AT ALL.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
>> Reporter: AFTER FIRST KILLING

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
HIS MOTHER AT THE FAMILY HOME,

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
AUTHORITIES SAY THE YOUNG MAN

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
HEADED TO THE SANDY HOOK
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, WEARING A

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
BULLETPROOF VEST.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
AUTHORITIES SAY HE WAS ARMED

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
WITH A SEMIAUTOMATIC ASSAULT

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
RIFLE AND TWO HIGH-POWERED

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
PISTOLS LIKE THESE.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
POLICE SAY BOTH HIS MOTHER AND

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
HIS FATHER LEGALLY OWNED A

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
NUMBER OF GUNS OF THE SAME KIND.

78
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A RELATIVE SAID ADAM WAS

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
OBVIOUSLY NOT WELL.

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
>> WE'LL GO BACKWARDS AS FAR AS

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
WE HAVE TO GO IN THIS

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
INVESTIGATION, AND HOPEFULLY

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
WE'LL STUMBLE ON ANSWERS.

CRIME PROFILERS ARE HAVING A

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
HARD TIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
IS WHY THE ATTACK ON THE

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
CHILDREN.

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
MOST OF THEM KILLED ON THE SPOT,

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES.

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THE ONLY THEORY IS BASED ON

92
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
REPORTS THAT HIS MOTHER,

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
DIVORCED THREE YEARS AGO AND

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
UNEMPLOYED, MAY HAVE WORKED AS A

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
TEACHERS' AIDE AT THE SCHOOL.

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
>> THE CHILDREN DIDN'T HARM HIM,

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
BUT THEY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
HIS MOTHER AND HIS MOTHER MAY BE

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
THE REAL FOCUS ALL OF THIS.

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THE ANGER AND RAGE AND

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
RESENTMENT HAS BUILT UP IN HIM

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS, AND HE

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
DECIDED, I'VE BEEN POWERLESS ALL

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
THIS TIME, AND NOW I'M GOING TO

105
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
EMPOWER MYSELF.

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
>> Reporter: BUT SO FAR, IT IS

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
ONLY A THEORY, FOLLOWING A DAY

108
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
OF CONFUSION AND MISINFORMATION

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
ABOUT THE TRAGEDY.

110
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
STARTING WHEN STATE AND FEDERAL

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
AUTHORITIES FIRST IDENTIFIED THE

112
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
SHOOTER AS ADAM'S OLDER BROTHER

113
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
RYAN, NOW A NEW YORK ACCOUNTANT.

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
THAT LED TO RYAN POSTING

115
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
MESSAGES ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE.

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
"IT WASN'T ME.

IT WASN'T ME."

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
BUT WHEN RYAN ARRIVED AT HIS

120
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
HOME IN HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY,

121
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
POLICE TOOK HIM INTO CUSTODY FOR
QUESTIONING.

122
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
AUTHORITIES WANT TO KNOW IF RYAN

123
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
OR ANYBODY ELSE IN THE FAMILY

124
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
HAD ANY IDEA ADAM WAS

125
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
THREATENING TO BECOME VIOLENT.

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
>> TYPICALLY, I'VE HEARD PEOPLE

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
SAY, YES, HE SAID THAT, BUT I

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
DIDN'T TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY.

129
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
YES, HE SAID THAT, I THOUGHT HE

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
WAS JOKING.

131
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT ANYONE

132
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
WOULD DO THAT.

133
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I JUST IGNORED HIM.

ADAM LANZA MADE ANY SUCH

135

THREATS.

136
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
IN THE END, HE APPARENTLY KILLED

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
HIMSELF AT THE SCHOOL AFTER

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
KILLING SO MANY OTHERS.

THE VISITOR, HE OR SHE NEEDED TO

640
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
PRESENT A PICTURE I.D., SIGN IN,

WOULD LOCK THE DOOR AND TURN OUT

653
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
REALLY HARD FOR KIDS.

NOT REAL.

656
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
