63
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
>> AT 10:00 IN THE MORNING, I

64
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
SET UP TO SELL HOTDOGS.

65
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
AT 10:30, I WAS READY TO SELL

66
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
HOTDOGS.
EVERYONE HAD TO HAVE A TICKET TO

67
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
RECEIVE A HOTDOG.

68
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
SO -- I GUESS ABOUT 11:30, MAYBE

69
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
A QUARTER TO 12, TWO GUYS CAME

70
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000

71
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
AND ONE WAS WEARING THE MASK

72
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
LOOKS LIKE A DEVIL'S MASK.

73
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
THE OTHER ONE WAS WEARING A SKI

74
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
PLAIVEG.
AND SO, YOU KNOW -- SKI MASK.

75
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THEY WERE

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000

77
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
JUST FUN.

78
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
SO THE GUY TOOK THEIR MAIVES

79
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000

80
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
THEY HAD A TICKET.
I GAVE NEM A HOTDOG.

81
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
AS SOON AS THEY GOT THROUGH

82
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
EATING THE HOTDOG, 3 MINUTES

83
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
LATER, THEY STARTED TO TEAR --

84
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
TURNING OVER THE COFFEE POTS,

85
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
URNS, ABOUT FOUR OF THEM.

86
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
THE TABLE GOT TURNED OVER AND BY

87
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
THAT TIME, THEY STARTED CUTTING

88
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
THE TENT.

89
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
COMING IN AND ONE OF THE

90
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
GROUNDSKEEPERS CAME IN AND SAID,

91
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
CLINT, HAVE YOU TO GET OUT OF

92
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
HERE.

93
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
THEY ARE CUTTING THE TENT.

94
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
THE TENT IS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE.

95
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
AT THAT TIME, I WAS TRYING TO

96
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
SAVE SOME OF MY STUFF, BUT I

97
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
COULDN'T.
BY THAT TIME, IT HAD COLLAPSED

98
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
AND I HAD TO CRAWL FROM UNDER

99
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
THE TENT TO GET AWAY.

100
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
AND SO, I CLIMBED OUT AND I WAS

101
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
JUST STANDING THERE AND AS I WAS

102
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
STANDING THERE.
THEY FORMED A LINE... AND THEY

103
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
WALKED ACROSS THE TENT, STOMPING

104
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THEIR

105
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
PATH.
TURNING OVER MY TABLES.

106
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000

107
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000

108
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000

109
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
MY POP.

110
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
THEY THREW MY POP AROUND.

111
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
THEY HOLLERED RACIAL SLUR, THE

112
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
"N" WORD.

113
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I WAS AN UNCLE TOM.

114
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I HAD NO BUSINESS ON THIS SIDE.

115
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
BUT I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO

116
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
THEM THAT I AM A HOTDOG VENDOR.

117
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I WAS HIRED BY THESE PEOPLE TO

118
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
COME IN AND SELL HOTDOGS TO

119
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
PEOPLE WHO THIS TICKS.

120
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

I HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR 16

122
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
YEARS, GRETA.

123
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THERE FOR.

124
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I GOT CAUGHT UP IN THAT.

125
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
>> GRETA: WERE YOU EVER ABLE TO

126
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000

127
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
OR WERE THEY AT ALL TIME IT'S.

128
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
>> NO!

129
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THEY TOOK THEIR MASKS OFF AND I

130
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
GAVE THEM A HOTDOG.

131
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
ONE WAS A RATHER THIN FELLA.

132
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000

134
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000

135
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000

136
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
YOUNG GUY.
>> GRETA: OTHER THAN THE VERY

137
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
OFFENSIVE RACIAL SLURS, DID THEY

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT RIGHT TO WORK

139
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
OR TO INDICATE WHAT SIDE OF THE

140
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
FIGHT THEY WERE ON, THIS BATTLE

141
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
OR WHETHER THEY WERE OUTSIDE

142
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
AGITATORS?
>> NO, THE PEOPLE WHO WERE

143
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
PROTESTING AGAINST THE

144
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
RIGHT-TO-WORK PEOPLE.

145
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
THEY WERE SO ANGRY AT THESE

146
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
PEOPLE.

147
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000

150
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
WORD.
THEY EVEN SPIT ON A COUPLE OF

151
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
PEOPLE.
THEY WERE OUT OF ORDER, GRETA.

152
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
TOTALLY.
>> GRETA: DID OTHERS JOIN IN OR

153
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000

PROTESTERS TRY TO STOP THEM OR

155
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
DID EVERYBODY STAND BY WHILE YOU

156
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
GOT TERRORIZED AND POSSIBLY VERY

157
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
HURTED WITH THE TENT?

158
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
>> NO.

159
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE THAT WAS

THEY HAD SAFETY THINGS ON, SO

161
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
THEY WERE TRYING TO CALM THE

162
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000

163
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000

00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
THEY HAD BOX CUTIRS OR KNIVES.

186
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
THEY STARTED TO CUT THE CANVAS

187
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
STRAPPED THAT TETHERED THE TENT

188
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
TO THE GROUND.
THEY STARTED TO FLIP OVER THE

189
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
TABLES THAT HAD HOT COUGHO IT.

190
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
IT WAS -- COFFEE ON IT.

191
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
IT WAS SCARY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE

192
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
FELT ACHERY, THEY FELT LIKE

193
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
THEIR PERSONAL SPACE HAD BEEN

194
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
INVADED AND THEIR RIGHT TO HAVE

195
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
THEIR VOICE HEARD WAS BEING

196
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
TRAMPLED ON.

197
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
>> GRETA: FOR YOU, DAVID, WHAT

198
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
WAS IT LIKE?

199
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
>> GOOD EVENING, GRETA.

200
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
IT WAS PRETTY INTENSE -- WE HAD

201
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
TO POST PEOPLE OUT BY THE STRAPS

202
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
TO KEEP THEM FROM UNDOING THEM

203
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
TO MAKE THE TENT CAVE IN.

204
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
WHEN THE COFFEE URNS WERE THROWN

205
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
OVER AND THE TABLES, WE KNEW

206
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
THEY WERE INSIDE.

207
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
WE CAME BACK AROUND AND WENT

208
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
INTO THE TENT.

209
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
IT WAS ALMOST COLLAPSED BY THEN.

210
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
>> GRETA: WHAT ARE THE POLICE

211
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
DOING ABOUT ALL OF THIS?

212
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
MICHIGAN STATE POLICE INSPECTOR

213
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
IS HERE.
GOOD EVENING.

214
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
>> GOOD EVENING, GRETA.

215
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
>> GRETA: WERE YOU OUTSIDE ON
THE GROUNDS YESTERDAY WHEN THIS

216
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WENT DOWN?

217
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
>> I WAS ALL OVER THE CAPITOL,

218
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
GRETA.
BUT WHEN THIS HAD

219
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
PLATOONS SURROUNDING THE

220
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
BUILDING, KEEPING TRACK OF THE

221
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
CROWD.
WE DO KNOW WHERE THE TENTS WERE.

222
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
HOWEVER, HAVING A GROUND VIEW

223
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
AND THE TENTS BEING ABOUT 40

224
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
DEEP INTO THE CROWD, WE WERE

225
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
UNABLE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON.

226
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
HOWEVER, WHEN OUR HELICOPTER

227
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
REPORTED THAT IT LOOKED LIKE THE

228
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
TWO CANOPIES HAD COLLAPSED, WE

229
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
SENT TWO PLATOONS OF TROOPERS

230
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY

231
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
WAS INJURED OR TRAPPED UNDER THE

232
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
TENTS.

233
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
BY THE TIME OUR TROOPERS WORKED

234
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CROWDS,

235
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
THE PEOPLE WERE OUT OF THE

236
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
TENTS.

237
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
>> GRETA: NOW, I TAKE IT NO

238
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
ARRESTS WERE MADE ON THE SCENE,

239
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
THAT YOU DIDN'T GET THE PLATOONS

240
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
OR SINGLE POLICE OFFICERS OVER

241
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
TO THE AREA TO MAKE THE ARREST

242
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
FOR THESE TWO WHO HAD STARTED

243
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THIS DESTRUCTION?

244
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
>> NO, MA'AM.

245
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
A CROWD OF THIS SIZE, THIS SIZE

246
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
KIND OF A MOB-LIKE GROUP AT THAT

247
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
TIME, IS VERY FLUID.

248
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
WE HAD OUR HANDS FULL,

249
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
MAINTAINING THE CONTROL OF THE

250
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
CROWD.
BUT WHEN OUR TWO PLATOONS OF

251
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
TROOPERS WERE THERE, NOBODY

252
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
REPORTED ANY INJURIES NOR DID

253
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
ANYBODY REPORT ANY DAMAGE OR
WANT TO FILE A DOM PLAINT --

254
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
COMPLAINT AT THAT TIME.

255
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
>> GRETA: WHETHER OR NOT ANYONE

256
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
REPORTS DAMAGING DOESN'T MEAN

257
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
THERE HASN'T BEEN A CRIME, WHEN

258
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
SOMEBODY IS CUTTING DOWN A TENT

259
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
AND TERRORIZING AND SCARYING

260
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
PEOPLE.
YOU HAVE A CRIME.

261
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
WOULD YOU NOT AGREE?

262
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
>> YES, MA'AM.
HOWEVER THE TENTS WERE A LOW

263
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
PRIORITY AT THAT TIME THAT.

264
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
HAPPENED ON TUESDAY AND AT 2:00

265
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
TODAY, THE RIGHT TO WORK GROUP

266
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
DID FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE

267
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
MICHIGAN STATE POLICE.

268
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
AND WE WILL INVESTIGATE THAT.

269
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
>> GRETA: DO YOU HAVE -- DID YOU

270
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
HAVE ALL THE VIDEO YOU NEED TO

271
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
PERHAPS IDENTIFY -- WE HAVE SOME

272
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
VIDEO, OBVIOUSLY, DO YOU HAVE

273
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
THE TWO WHO ORIGINALLY WENT INTO

274
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
THE TENT WITH THE MASKS.

275
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
THEY WENT THEIR MASKS OFF.

276
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
>> WE HAVE LIMITED VIDEO.

277
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
AND OUR DETECTIVES HAVE NOT HAD

278
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
A CHANCE TO CHECK THAT YET.

279
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
AGAIN, THIS REPORT CAME IN AT

280
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
2:30 AND IT WAS JUST BARELY

281
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
PROCESSED TODAY.
>> GRETA: HAVE YOU HEARD ANY

282
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
REPORT INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT

283
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
OUR GUESTS HAVE SAID FROM LAST

284
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
NIGHT AND TONIGHT, OUR LIVE

285
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
GUESTS?

286
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
>> NO, MA'AM.
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS AN ASSAULT

287
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
ON A REPORTER ALSO.

288
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
AND THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS NOT

289
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
FILED A POLICE REPORT WITH THE

290
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
STATE POLICE YET YEERGHT.

291
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
>> GRETA: YOU KNOW, YOU WATCH

292
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
THIS AND IT'S DISGUSTING.

293
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
DO YOU AGREE?

294
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
THE VIOLENCE -- I MEAN, A HOTDOG

295
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
SELLING GUY -- I MEAN, WHY DO

296
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
THAT TO HIM?

297
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
>> MR. TARVAR IS AN INSTITUTION

298
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
IN DOWNTOWN LANSING.

299
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
VIEATEN HIS HOTDOGS MANY TIMES.

300
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
YOU KNOW, OVERALL, A CROWD OF

301
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
OVER 12,000 WERE WELL BEHAVED.

302
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WERE A

303
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
HANDFUL OF PEOPLE, WHETHER IT

304
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
WAS EMOTION OR WHATEVER, LET

305
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
THINGS GET OUT OF CONTROL AND

306
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
JUST GAVE THIS ENTIRE PROTEST A

307
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
BAD REPUTATION.

308
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
>> GRETA: I AM CURIOUS IF HE'S

309
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
AN INSTITUTION, WHETHER OR NOT

310
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
HE WAS TARGETED IN PARTICULAR

311
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
BECAUSE HE IS OBVIOUSLY SELLING

312
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
HOTDOGS INSIDE THE TENT OF ONE

313
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
SIDE OF THIS, IN THIS INSTANCE,

314
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING

315
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
THE NEW LAW.

316
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
WAS HE TARGETD?

317
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
THE RACIAL SLUSHES HURLED AT

318
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
HIM?
>> GRETA:.

319
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
>> WELL, THAT'S PART OF THE

320
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
CROWD MENTALITY.

321
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
HE HAPPENED TO BE AT THE WRONG

322
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME, WITH

323
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
THE WRONG GROUP, AS FAR AS THE

324
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
OTHER PROTESTERS FELT.

325
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
>> GRETA: ONE THING IS CERTAIN,

326
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHO

327
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
DID THIS TO THIS MAN AND THE

328
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
OTHER PEOPLE, CUTTING DOWN THE

329
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
TENT.
LUCKY THAT PEOPLE WEREN'T

330
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
MOTHERED, I SUPPOSE.

331
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
BY THE TENT.

332
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
IF PEOPLE HAVE THE DISEENS TOW

333
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
COME FORWARD AND GIVE YOU SOME

334
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
TIPS.

335
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I HOPE YOU GET THEM.

336
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

337
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
>> I HOPE IF PEOPLE DO HAVE

338
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
INFORMATION, THEY DO PRESENT IT

339
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
TO THE MICHIGAN STATE POLICE.

340
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
>> GRETA: THANK YOU, SIR.

341
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
>> YES, MA'AM.

342
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
>> GRETA: U.N. AMBASSADOR AND

RAWNING FOR THE SECRETARY OF
STATE.

345
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
>> THE SECOND BIG STORY, SUSAN

346
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
RICE.
JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF HOUR,

347
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
CALL THEEING THE PRESIDENT,

348
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
SAYING SHE IS PULLING HER NAME

349
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR

350
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
SECRETARY OF STATE, ALL BECAUSE

351
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
OF THAT CONTROVERSY OVER

352
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
BENGHAZI, HER REACTION TO THE

353
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
TERROR ATTACK, WHETHER OR NOT

354
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
SHE MISLED THE PUBLIC.

355
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
>> BEST ASSESSMENT WE HAVE TODAY

356
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
IS THAT IN FACT, THIS WAS NOT A

357
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
PRE-PLANNED, PREMADE TITTED --

358
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
PREMEDITATED ATTACK.

359
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
>> I AM MORE TROUBLED TODAY,

360
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
KNOWING, HAVING MET WITH THE

361
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE CIA AND

362
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
AMBASSADOR RICE.
>> IT WAS A PONTANEOUS REACTION

363
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
TO WHAT HAD JUST TRANSPIRED IN

364
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
CAIRO, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE

365
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
VIDEO.

366
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
>> THE OBSESSIVE FOCUS ON

367
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
AMBASSADOR RICE'S APPEARANCE ON

368
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
A SERIES OF SUNDAY SHOWS IS

369
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
MISPLACED AND MISGUIDED.

370
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
>> WHY DID THE ADMINISTRATION

371
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
PULT HER OUT THERE AS THE

372
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
SPOKESPERSON?
>> IF SENATOR McCAIN AND

373
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
SENATOR GRAHAM AND OTHERS WANT

374
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
TO GO AFTER SOMEBODY, THEY

375
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
SHOULD GO AFTER ME.

376
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
>> SUSAN RICE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

377
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
BETTER.

378
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
IF SHE DIDN'T KNOW BETTER, SHE'S

379
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
NOT QUALIFIED.

380
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
>> BUT FOR THEM TO GO AFTER THE

381
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
U.N. AMBASSADOR, WHO HAD NOTHING

382
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
TO DO WITH BENGHAZI AND WAS

383
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
SIMPLY MAKING A PRESENTATION,

384
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
BASED ON INTELLIGENCE THAT SHE

385
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
HAD RECEIVED THAT BEMIMPED HER

386
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
REPUTATION IS OUTRAGEOUS.

387
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
>> I AM MORE DISTURBED NOW THAN

388
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I WAS BEFORE THAT THE 16th

389
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
OF SEPTEMBER EXPLANATION ABOUT

390
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
HOW FOUR AMERICANS DIED IN

391
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
BENGHAZI, LIBYA, BY AMBASSADOR

392
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
RICE, I THINK DOES NOT DO

393
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
JUSTICE TO THE REALITY AT THE

394
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
TIME.

395
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
AND IN MINDSIGHT CLEARLY WAS

396
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
COMPLETELY WRONG.

397
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
>> GRETA: IN A LETTER TO

398
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA, A SHORT TIME

399
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
AGO, AMBASSADOR RICE, WRITING IN

400
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
PART...

401
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
SHE CONTINUES AND SAYS...

402
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
SENATOR LINDSAY GRAHAM JOINS US.

403
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
>> GOOD EVENING.

404
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
>> GRETA: YOUR RESPONSE TO THE
LETTER THAT THE AMBASSADOR SENT

405
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
TO THE PRESIDENT, THREE OR FOUR

406
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
PARAGRAPH, ACCUSING THOSE WHO

407
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
CRITICIZE HER OF POLITICIZING IT

408
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
AND CAUSING AN IRRESPONSIBLE

409
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
DISAKZ DISTRACTION.

410
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
ARE YOU POLITICIZING IT?

411
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
ARE YOU CAUSING AN IRRESPONSIBLE

412
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
DISTRACTION?
>> I THINK THE PROBLEM HERE IS

413
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
THAT SHE WENT ON NATIONAL

414
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
TELEVISION, FIVE DAYS AFTER THE

415
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
ATTACK THAT KILLED FOUR

416
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
AMERICANS AND TOLD A STORY THAT

417
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
IS NOT BASED ON ANY REALITY THAT

418
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I HAVE SEEN.
SHE TOLD A POLITICAL STORY THREE

419
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION.

420
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
THEY SANITIZED THE INTELLIGENCE.

421
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
SHE SAYS THE CONSULATE WAS

422
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
STRONG, SUBSTANTIALLY AND

423
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
SIGNIFICANTLY DEFENDED.

424
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM
THE TRUTH.

425
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
SHE INDICATED THAT AL QAEDA WAS

426
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
DECIMATED, TRYING TO CONTINUE

427
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
THE NARRATIVE THAT THE PRESIDENT

428
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT SINCE THE

429
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
DEATH OF BIN LADEN, I COLD HER

430
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
ACCOUNTABLE AND -- I HOLD HER

431
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
ACCOUNTABLE AND RESPONSIBLE FOR

432
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
MISLEADING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

433
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I THINK SHE WAS CHOSE TONE

434
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
TELL -- FOR A REASON.

435
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
IF HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

436
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
BENGHAZI, AS THE PRESIDENT

437
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
INDICATED, WHY DID THEY PICK

438
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
HER?

439
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I THOUGHT SHE WAS THE MOST

440
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
POLITICALLY COMPLIANT PERSON

441
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
THEY COULD FIND.

442
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
AND THE STORY SHE TOLD DOESN'T

443
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
WITHSTAND SCRUTINY.

444
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
>> GRETA: DO YOU FACTOR INTO THE

445
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
EQUATION -- I CONFESS THAT I

446
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
DO -- SHE WENT ON FIVE SHOWS AND

447
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
IT TOOK 73 DAYS BEFORE SHE SAID

448
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
ANYTHING DIFFERENT AND THAT WAS

449
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
TO U.S. SENATORS BEHIND CLOSED

450
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
DOORS, BUT IT TOOK 73 DAYS

451
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
FORLER TO SPEAK OUT, NOT EVEN

452
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
PUBLICLY, BUT BEHIND CLOSED

453
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
DOORS.

454
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
>> I I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD

455
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
HAVE EVER SAID SHE WAS WRONG.

456
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
THIS IS NOT ABOUT SUSAN RICE.

457
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID, IF YOU HAVE

458
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
A PROBLEM WITH BENGHAZI -- I

459
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
DO -- IT IS NOT PICKING ON THE

460
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
PRESIDENT.
IT IS TRYING TO EXPOSE A

461
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
NATIONAL SECURITY FAILURE, A

462
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
DEBACLE.
I HOLD THE PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE

463
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
MORE THAN ANYTHINGCH -- MORE

464
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

465
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED OR

466
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
REINFORCED BEFORE THE ATTACK ON

467
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
9/11.
THERE IS NOTHING TO DO TO HELP

468
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
THE PEOPLE.

469
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
WHERE WAS HE AS COMMANDENER

470
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
CHIEF.
HAVE YOU TWO MOVIES BEING MADE

471
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
IN THE RAID ON BIN LADEN.

472
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

473
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID IN THE

474
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
SEVEN HOURS OF THE ATTACK.

475
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
AND AFTERWARD, THE PRESIDENT

476
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
TRIED TO BLAME THIS ON A VIDEO

477
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
AND A MOB AND A DEMONSTRATION

478
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
THAT NEVER EXISTED.

479
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
BUT SUSAN RICE, IN MY OPINION,

480
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
MISLED THE PUBLIC.

481
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS WITH

482
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
HER TIME AND POLITICS AND

483
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
NATIONAL FOREIGN AFFAIRS ARENA.

484
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
HER PROBLEMS WERE DEEPER THAN ME

485
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
AND DEEPER THAN BENGHAZI.

486
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
BUT WE WON'T LET THIS GO.

487
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
HOW COULD FOR SEVEN HOURS,

488
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
NOBODY COME TO THE AID OF THE

489
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
PEOPLE DURING THE ATTACK?

490
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
WHY DID WE LEAVE THE CONSULATE

491
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
OPEN?
WHERE WAS THE PRESIDENT WHEN THE

492
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
BRITISH DECIDED TO CLOSE THEIR

493
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
CONSULATE IN JUNE AND

494
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
AFTERWARDS, HOW DID THE

495
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
INTELLIGENCE GET SO SCREWED UP?

496
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
WE ARE GOING TO KEEP PRESSING

497
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
THIS SO WE CAN LEARN FROM IT AND

498
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
NOT HAVE IT HAPPEN AGAIN.

499
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
>> GRETA: THANK YOU, SIR.

500
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
>> THANK YOU.

501
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
>> GRETA: FORMER U.N. AMBASSADOR

502
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
JOHN BOLTON IS HERE.

503
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
>> GLAD TO BE HERE.

504
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
>> GRETA: YOU HEARD ME SAY TO

505
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
THE SENATOR NHER LETTER TO THE

506
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
PRESIDENT, SHE HAS AN OP-ED

507
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
PIECE IN THE WASHINGTON POST,

508
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
POLITICIZING, IRRESPONSIBLE

509
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
DISTRACTION, CRITICS OF HER AND

510
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
IN THE WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE,

511
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
SHE REFERS TO THE DEBATE ABOUT

512
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
HER AS BEING A POLITICAL

513
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
FOOTBALL.
HOW DO WE KNOW IF SHE IS RIGHT

514
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
OR WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A

515
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
FAIR SCRUTINY OF A GOVERNMENT

516
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
EMPLOYEE.
>> I THINK IT'S ALWAYS FAIR

517
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
SCRUTINY.

518
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
EVERYTHING YOU SAY IN PUBLIC

519
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
WHEN YOU ARE A SENIOR GOVERNMENT

520
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
OFFICIAL IS OPEN TO QUESTION.

521
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
AND IN FACT HERE, THE

522
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO HAVE IT

523
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
BOTH WAYS.

524
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
THEY TRIED TO GET THEIR STORY

525
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
LINE OUT THAT THE KILLINGS IN

526
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
BENGHAZI WERE CAUSED BY THE

527
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
MUHAMMAD VIDEO.
WHEN THE DATA SHOWED THAT THAT

528
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
WAS FANTASY, THEY TRIED TO

529
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
STONEWALL PAST THE ELECTION TO

530
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
STONEWALL PAST THE POSSIBLE

531
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
NOMINATION OF SECRETARY OF STATE

532
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
AND IT HAS FALLEN APART.

533
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
SUSAN RICE MAY BE AN UNFORTUNATE

534
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
VICTIM.

535
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
BUT THIS IS ALL DUE TO THE

536
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
PRESIDENT'S OWN STRATEGY.

537
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
>> GRETA: YOU KNOW, SHE IS

538
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
WITHDRAWING HER NAME FROM

539
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
CONSIDERATION.

540
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
SHE WAS NEVER NOMINATED.

541
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I DON'T KNOW IF THE PRESIDENT
SAID HE INTENDED TO NOMINATE

542
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
HER.
THIS IS LIKE EYE COULD SUBMIT A

543
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
LETTER WITHDRAWING MY NAME FROM

544
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
CONSIDERATION.
>> SURE, I COULD SIT AT HOME BY

545
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
THE PHONE AND WAIT FOR HIS CALL

546
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
TO TO NOMINATE ME.

547
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
>> GRETA: WHY DID SHE SEND THAT

548
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
LETTER AND MAKE IT PUBLIC AND

549
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
WHY TONIGHT?

550
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
>> I THINK THEY HAD COME TO A

551
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
POLITICAL CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS

552
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
TOO COST THREE GO FORWARD AND

553
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
SHE WANTED TO GET HER TWO CENTS

554
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
WORTH IN ON THAT.

555
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I WOULD BE SURPRISED NOW IF

556
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
AFTER A FEW INTERVIEWS ON

557
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
FRIENDLY TELEVISION NETWORKS

558
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
TONIGHT, THERE IS MUCH MORE

559
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
DISCUSSION ABOUT.

560
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
IT I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION

561
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
WANTS TO GET THIS OFF THE RADAR

562
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
SCREEN.

563
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
SO I AM ENCOURAGED THAT SENATOR

564
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
GRAHAM AND I AM SURE OTHERS IN

565
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
CONGRESS, ARE NOT GOING TO LET

566
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
IT GO.

567
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
NOW THAT SUSAN RICE IS OUT OF

568
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
THE PICTURE, I THINK THIS OPENS

569
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
THE WAY, BEGINNING NEXT WEEK

570
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
WITH HILLARY CLINTON'S TESTIMONY

571
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
IN CONGRESS, AS TO WHAT ACTUALLY

572
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
HAPPENED.

573
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
>> GRETA: IT'S INTERESTING IN
HER LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT, SHE

574
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
STALKS ABOUT WHAT SHE SAYS ARE

575
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
THE SUCCESSES THAT SHE IS PART

576
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
OF WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND

577
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
ONE OF THEM IS INCREASING THE

578
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ON IRAN

579
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
AND NORTH KOREA WITH THE

580
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
TOUGHEST SANCTIONS EVER.

581
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
THAT DID HAPPEN, BUT WE HAVEN'T

582
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
GOTTEN ANYWHERE.
THEY ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE

583
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.

584
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
NORTH KOREA INTEREST A MISSILE

585
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
LAUNCH.
>> THE SANCTIONS FROM THE PAST

586
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
FOUR YEARS ARE MARGINAL,

587
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
COMPARED TO THE SANCTIONS

588
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
IMPOSED BEFORE, YET IRAN IS EVER

589
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
CLOSER TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS, NORTH

590
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
KOREA LAUNCHED A SATELLITE INTO

591
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
-- BIT.

592
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
THE WORLD IS MORE DANGEROUS, NOT

593
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
BECAUSE OF SUSAN RICE, BUT

594
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
BECAUSE OF BARACK OBAMA.

595
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
>> GRETA: I AM HIGHLY CRITICAL

596
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
THAT SHE ROLLED OUT FOR 73 DAYS

597
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
AND DIDN'T CORRECT IT AND SHOULD

598
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
HAVE.

599
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE HAD

600
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
THAT MYSTERY LINGERING.

601
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
PEOPLE I TALKED TO SAY SHE HAS

602
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN THE SOUTH

603
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
SUDAN AND SAVING LIVES THERE IN

604
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
A VERY TERRIBLE SITUATION.

605
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I WILL GIVE HER CREDIT FOR THAT.

606
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
>> OKAY.
>> GRETA: THANK YOU, SIR.

607
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> GRETA: STRAIGHT AHEAD, HOW DO

608
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
WE LET THIS HAPPEN?

609
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
A U.S. MARINE CHAINED UP IN A

610
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
DANGEROUS MEXICAN PRISON.

611
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
THE PARENTS GETTING HORRIFYING

612
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
CALLS ABOUT SENDING MOAN TOW

613
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
SAVE HIS LIFE.

614
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
THAT DISTURBING STORY IS NEXT.

615
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
AND CONGRESSMAN JASON CHAFITS

616
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
ACCUSING THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF

617

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
HE IS HERE.

619
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
AND CAUGHT ON CAMERA, IF YOU

620
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
THINK OUR CONGRESS FIGHTS, TAKE

621
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000

BRAWL?
WHERE IN THE WORLD IS THIS?

YOU WILL SEE A LOT MORE, COMING

625
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000

00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
From the best

627
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
to the number 1 club
in the world.

628
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The potential of
Manchester United unlocked.

629
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
NYSE Euronext.

630
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Unlocking the world's potential.

IT'S PART OF WHAT YOU
SLOVE ABOUT HER.ESSING.

639
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
BUT YOUR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION -

YOU KNOW, THAT COULD BE
A QUESTION OF BLOOD FLOW.

641
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000

HELPS YOU BE READY
ANYTIME THE
MOMENT'S RIGHT.

644
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
AND THE SAME CIALIS IS THE ONLY

SYMPTOMS OF BPH,

646
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
LIKE NEEDING TO GO
FREQUENTLY OR URGENTLY.

647
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT ALL

648
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
YOUR MEDICAL CONDITIONS
AND MEDICATIONS,

649
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
AND ASK IF YOUR HEART IS HEALTHY
ENOUGH FOR SEXUAL ACTIVITY.

650
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
DO NOT TAKE CIALIS IF YOU TAKE
NITRATES FOR CHEST PAIN,

651
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
AS THIS MAY CAUSE AN UNSAFE
DROP IN BLOOD PRESSURE.

652
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL
IN EXCESS WITH CIALIS.

653

SIDE EFFECTS MAY INCLUDE

654
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000

TO AVOID LONG-TERM INJURY,
SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP

656
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
FOR AN ERECTION LASTING
MOREHAN FOUR HOURS.

657
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000

661
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
STOP TAKING CIALIS AND GET

662
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT CIALIS

663
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
AND A 30-TABLET FREE TRIAL.

664

>> GRETA: HE SURVIVES IRAQ AND

665
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
AFGHANISTAN, BUT A U.S. MARINE

666
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
IS FIGHT EGG VERY DANGEROUS

667
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
BATTLE IN MEXICO, FIGHTING TO

668
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
STAY ALIVE.

669
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
HE IS IN A VICIOUS MEXICAN

670
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
PRISON AND WORSE, HE IS UNDER

671
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
CONSTANT THREATS FROM VIOLENT

672
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
DRUG CARTELS.

673
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
HE WAS ARRESTED, PASSING THROUGH

674
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
A MEXICAN BORDER CITY ON THE WAY

675
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
TO COSTA RICA.

676
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
HE WAS ARRESTED FOR CARRYING HIS

677
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
GRANDFATHER'S ANTIQUE SHOTGUN.

678
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
ON THE U.S. SIDE OF THE BORDER,

679
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
AN AGENT TOLD HIM THE GUN WAS

680
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
LEGAL, AS LONG AS HE DECLARED IT

681
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
TO MEXICAN AUTHORITIES.

682
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
SO THAT'S WHAT HE DID AND THAT'S

683
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
WHAT GOT HIM ARRESTED.

684
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
THE PARENTS ARE BEGGING THE

685
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO HELP

686
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000

>> GRETA: NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE.

690
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
WHY CAN'TY GET HIM OUT OF JAIL?

691
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
WHAT'S WRONG?

692
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
>> OKAY.

693
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
RIGHT NOW, THERE IS A FLIEL

694
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
MEXICO, TRIALS START AT CERTAIN

695
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
POINTS AND THERE IS DIFFERENT

696
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
HEARINGS, LIKE IN THE UNITED

697
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
STATES OF AMERICA.

698
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
AND WE ARE READY TO GO WITH OUR

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
EXPERTS AND ALSO WE HAVE MOTIONS

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
AND WE HAVE TWO INJUNCTIONS FOR

701
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE FOR

702
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
VIOLATION OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL

703
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
RIGHTS.

704
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
>> GRETA: WHEN IS THIS TRIAL

705
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
DATE?
>> THE TRIAL DATE'S BEEN ON.

706
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
THE NEXT HEARING'S SET FOR

707
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
JANUARY 17.

708
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
THAT DATE, GRETA, WAS MOVED,

709
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
CONTINUED, FROM OCTOBER 30 OR

710
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
THEREABOUTS.
THE HEARINGS WERE SET FOR

711
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
NOVEMBER 13 AND 23 AND THEY WERE

712
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
CONTINUED BECAUSE THE MEXICANOMO

AND WE HAVE TO BRING HIM IN, THE

714
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
JUDGE WANTED TO CROSS-EXAMINE

715
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
AND WE SAID, OF COURSE.

716
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I SAID YES.

717
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
SO HE WILL HAVE TO BE BRAWLT

718
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
BROUGHT IN FOR

719
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
CROSS-EXAMINATION.

720
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
>> GRETA: ALL RIGHT.
WHERE IS OUR STATE DEPARTMENT ON

721
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
THIS?
AND WHY CAN'T WE GET THE MEXICAN

722
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
GOVERNMENT TO HELP?

723
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
WHAT IS WRONG WITH A BOND TO GET

724
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
HIM OUT?

725
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I SUNDAY UNDERSTAND THE PRISON

726
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
IS FILLED WITH A CARTEL, WHY YOU

727
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
GET HIM OUT ON BOND?

728
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
>> OKAY.

729
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
THERE ARE THREE ANSWERS THAT

730
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
NEED TO BE SAID.

731
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
FIRST OF ALL, ON BOND.

732
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
THIS PARTICULAR CRIME IS CHARGED

733
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
WITH A SERIOUS CRIME.

734
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
AND THERE IS A CATALOG OF CRIMES

735
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
THAT DO NOT ALLOW FOR BAIL.

736
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
THERE WAS SOME INDICATIONS TO

737
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
ARTICLE 19 OF THE MEXICAN

738
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
CONSTITUTION THAT ALLOW FOR BAIL

739
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
NOW, EXCEPT THAT SUPPOSEDLY,

740
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
SOME COURTS HAVE HELD THAT THAT

741
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
IS STILL NOT INTO EFFECT.

742
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
OTHER COURTS HAVE HELD THAT IT

743
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
HAS COME INTO EFFECT.

744
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
THAT'S A SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL

745
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
ISSUE.
MEANWHILE, TALKING ABOUT THE

746
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
JAIL, PARTICULARLY, HE WAS IN

747
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
THE GENERAL POPULATION, SOME

748
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
MONTHS AGO, FOR HIS WELL BEING,

749
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
THE U.S. CONSULATE, AS FAR AS I

750
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
UNDERSTAND, WAS ABLE TO MOVE HIM

751
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
TO AN ISOLATED PLACE BECAUSE

752
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
THIS JAIL THIS, PARTICULAR JAIL,

753
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
DOESN'T HAVE -- LET'S SAY LIKE

754
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
AN ISOLATED, SINGLE CELL FOR

755
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
PROTECTION.
THAT'S WHERE THEY HAVE HIM TO

756
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
PROTECT HIM FROM THREATS OR

757
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
WHATEVER.
>> GRETA: I FIND IT -- I KNOW

758
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
YOU ARE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING

759
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
YOU CAN.

760
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
BUT HE IS A U.S. MARINE.

761
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND OF THE

762
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
FACTS, ARE THE FACTS THE CORRECT

763
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
FACTS?
THAT HE INFORMED THE U.S. AGENT

764
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
AT THE BORDER HE HAD THE ANTIQUE

765
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
GUN AND HEAVE -- HE WAS ON THE

766
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
WAY OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND THE

767
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT NOTIFIED HIM,

768
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?
>> 80%.

769
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
THE OTHER PART, A U.S. CUSTOMS

770
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
AGENT TOLD HIM IT WAS LEGAL TO

771
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
GO TO MEXICO WITH REGISTRATION

772
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
PAPERS.
THE PROBLEM WAS WHEN HE CAME

773
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
BACK INTO THE STATES.
HE GOES TO MEXICO WITH CUSTOMS

774
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
AND THEY TELL HIM TO WAIT AND

775
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
THEN FIVE HOURS LATER, HE WAS

776
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
ARRESTED FOR VIOLATION OF

777
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
ARTICLE 11, PARAGRAPH "H" OF THE

778
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
FEDERAL LAW OF WEAPONS AND

779
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
EXPLOSIVES, WHICH HAS THAT YOU

780
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
CAN IMPORT ANY SHOTGUN EXCEPT

781
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
CERTAIN TYPE OF SHOTGUNS.

782
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
FOR EXAMPLE, ONCE A CERTAIN

783
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
CALIBER.

784
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
THIS PARTICULAR CALIBER

785
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
WAS .410, WHICH IS NOT -- THIS

786
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
IS NOT RESERVED FOR THE

787
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE ARMED

788
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
FORCES, AND NEITHER WERE THE

789
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
BULLETS, THE GAINS, THAT WAS FOR

790
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
THE NON-EXCLUSIVE.

791
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
THE ISSUE IS THE LEPT OF THE

792
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
BARREL, THAT'S THE PROBLEM --

793
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
HOW IT WAS MEASURED AND ALSO,

794
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
MOST IMPORTANT, THAT THAT -- LET

795
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY -- IT WAS

796
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
NOT SAWED OFF.

797
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
AND THIS HAS TO BE UNDER 25

798
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
INCHES AND WE BELIEVE THE

799
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
MEASURE WAS TAKEN THE WRONG WAY

800
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO

801
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
HEAMPL AT.
>> GRETA: I WISH YOU LUCK.

802

BUT, YOU KNOW, IT MAKES MY BLOOD

803
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
BOIL.
ALL SORTS OF INTERNATIONAL

804
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
TRADES ARE GOING FOR PRISONERS.

805
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
PAN AM 103, A KILLER OF 170

806
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
PEOPLE AND THERE WAS A SWAP FOR

807
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
HUMANITARIAN REASONS TO GO HOME

808
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
TO LIBYA.
WE HAVE A GUY WHO MAKES AN

809
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
INNOCENT MISTAKE WITH A GUN, A

810
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
U.S. MARINE AND THE U.S.

811
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
GOVERNMENT CAN'T FIND A SOLUTION

812
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
TO GET HIM HOME.

813
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I AM VERY TROUBLED BECAUSE I

814
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
KNOW THIS GOES ON EVERY DAY OF

815
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
THE WEEK.

816
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I HOPE OUR GOVERNMENT STEPS IN

817
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
AND GIVES YOU MORE HELP.

818
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000

1173
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
INSSENSITIVE TO THEM THAT IS

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000

THIS IS WRONG ON MANY LEVELS.

1176
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
FIRST, THIS IS BLAMING THE

1177
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000

1178
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
TERROR AND THE ACT OF MURDER.

1179
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000

IN MANY DIFFERENT TIMES, IT'S A

1206
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
LITTLE CULTURAL SENSITIVITY IS

1207
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
DANGEROUS AND LEADS TO STRATEGIC

1208

>> GRETA: MAYBE THEY NEED

1209

CULTURAL SENSITIVITY THAT WE

>> THE WHOLE IDEA OF BUILDING

1214

1215
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
STRAIN THEM, BUT TO BE AN

1216
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000

1217
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
ARE LIKE, OUR PROFESSIONALISM,

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
BEEN HELD UP FOR A WHILE THAT

1267
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
ARE PROBABLY GOING TO COME OUT

1268
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

1269
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
PRETTY SOON.

1270
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
THE FEELING IS THAT THEY HAD A

1271
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
LOT OF REGULATIONS, SOME OF

1272
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
WHICH WOULD BE POLITICALLY

1273
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
UNPOPULAR, THAT THEY HELD ON TO

1274
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.

1275
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT

1276
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
REGULATIONS, WHICH WOULD HAVE AT

1277
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
LEAST $100 MILLION EFFECT ON THE

1278
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
ECONOMY EVERY YEAR.

1279
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION --

1280
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
>> GOOD OR BAD.

1281
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
>> WHATEVER.

1282
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I MEAN, IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

1283
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
CONGRESS WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU

1284
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
ARE GOING TO DO THIS SIGNIFICANT

1285
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
REGULATION, THE OBAMA

1286
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
ADMINISTRATION DID 63 OF THEM IN

1287
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
2009.
63 IN 2010, 50 IN 2011 AND THEN

1288
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
ABOUT 20 THIS YEAR.

1289
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
>> GRETA: IS THAT BECAUSE THEY

1290
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
HAVE DONE ALL THE ONES THEY

1291
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
WANTED TO AND JUST OVER TIME,

1292
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
THEY HAD NO MORE TO DO.

1293
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
OR WAS THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE

1294
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
TRYING TO HIDE THEM AND DO

1295
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
POLITICAL MANEUVERING AND HOW DO

1296
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
YOU TELL?
>> REPUBLICANS SAY THERE IS A

1297
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
LOT OF THEM IN THE PIPELINE.

1298
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
SO THEY WOULD -- THE VIEW THE

1299
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
LATTER ANSWER.

1300
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
THEY SAY THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM

1301
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
IN THE PIPELINE.

1302
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED THE

1303
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
UNIFIED AGENDA OF FEDERAL

1304
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
REGULATIONS THAT THE

1305
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
ADMINISTRATION IS REQUIRED TO

1306
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
PUBLISH EACH YEAR IN THE SPRING

1307
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
AND THE FALL AND THEY HAVEN'T

1308
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
PUBLISHED EITHER ONE THIS YEAR.

1309
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
THE REPUBLICANS ARE GETTING VERY

1310
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
SUSPICIOUS,.

1311
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
>> GRETA: IF THEY ARE REQUIRED

1312
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
TO, WHY AREN'T THEY DOING IT?

1313
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I DON'T GET T. I AM REQUIRED TO

1314
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
BE HERE AT 10:00 EVERY NIGHT.

1315
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
SO I SHOW UP.

1316
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I DON'T GET IT.
>> WHY HASN'T SENATE PASSED A

1317
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
BUDGET?
>> GRETA: HOW DO YOU GET THE

1318
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
JOBS WHERE YOU HAVE REQUIREMENTS

1319
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO?

1320
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
HOW DO YOU GET THEM?

1321
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
>> IT HELPS IF YOU GET ELECTED.

1322
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
>> GRETA: I GUESS.

1323
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
>> THEY HAVEN'T PUBLISHED THESE

1324
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
THINGS.
THE REPUBLICANS THINK THERE WILL

1325
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
BE A LOT OF REGULATIONS ON THE

1326
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
ENVIRONMENT, THERE WILL BE VERY

1327
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
COSTLY REGULATIONS ON RUNOFF IN

1328
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
THE POLLUTION FROM COAL-FIRED

1329
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
POWER PLANTS.

1330
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
WE KNOW THERE IS GOING TO BE A

1331
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
LOT OF REGULATIONS ABOUT

1332
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
OBAMACARE THAT ARE COMING OUT --

1333
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
>> GRETA: WE ARE GETTING THOSE.

1334
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
>> EXACTLY!

1335
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
WE TALKED ABOUT THE $63 A HEAD

1336
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
LEVY THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

1337
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS

1338
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
PUTTING ON EVERY SINGLE PERSON

1339
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
WHO HAS INSURANCE, CHARGING THE

1340
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
INSURERS THAT.

1341
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
WE KNOW THERE IS A LOT MORE

1342
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
COMING OUT OF OBAMACARE BECAUSE,

1343
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
OBVIOUSLY, THE EXCHANGES HAVE TO

1344
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
BE UP AND RUNNING BY THIS FALL

1345
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
AND THE WHOLE THING'S GOING TO

1346
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
BE GOING BY JANUARY 1.

1347
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
>> GRETA: IS THIS SOMETHING

1348
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
OTHER ADMINISTRATIONS DID WHEN

1349
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
THE SHOE WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT?

1350
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
>> THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DID A

1351
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
LOT OF REGULATING.

1352
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT T. BUT

1353
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
OBAMA HAS DONE MORE.

1354
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
THE NUMBER OF ECONOMICALLY

1355
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
SIGNIFICANT REGULATIONS HE HAS

1356
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
DONE, HAS BEEN HIGHER THAN IN

1357
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS.

1358
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
AND SOME OF THIS IS PLAIN OLD

1359
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
REPUBLICAN SUSPICION BECAUSE

1360
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
THEY THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS

1361
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
HOLDING BACK BEFORE THE

1362
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
ELECTION, NOW THAT HE IS SAFELY

1363
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
RE-ELECTED AND CAN'T RUN AGAIN,

1364
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
NOW HE IS GOING TO LET IT OUT.

1365
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
>> GRETA: WE ARE FINDING OUT

1366
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
MORE ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE AND
THE FIGHTING IS GROWING.

1367
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
>> THAT'S GOING TO BE HUGE.

1368
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
>> GRETA: YOU ARE THE ONE WHO

1369
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
TIPPED ME OFF TO THE 17 SENATOR

1370
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
WHO IS WANT TO GET RID OF A TAX

1371
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
THAT THEY VOTED FOR.

1372
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
>> WHICH THEY VOTED FOR.

1373
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
>> GRETA: WHICH THEY VOTED FOR.

1374
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
NICE TO SEE YOU.

1375
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.

1376
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
>> GRETA: COMING UP, A BRAWL

1377
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
BREAKING OUT IN A BASKETBALL

1378
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
GAME.
BUT NOT THE PLAYERS.

1379
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
THE CHAOS IS CAUGHT ON CAMERA.

1380
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
YOU WILL SEEEEEEEEEE
This holiday, Share Everything.

1381
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Share "Not even close."

1382
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Share "You owe me..."

1383
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Share "Just right."

1384
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
The Share Everything Plan.

1385
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Sharable data across 10 devices

1386
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
with unlimited
talk and text.

1387
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Get a Droid Razr M

1388
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
by Motorola for $49.99.

1389
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
...so as you can see, GEICO's
customer satisfaction is at 97%.

1390
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Mmmm tasty.

1391
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
And cut! Very good.

1392
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

1393
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

1394
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

1395
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
It's not real.

1396
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

1397
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

1398
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

1399
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Someone get me a latte will ya,
please?

1400
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000

THE MID-SIZE PRICE.
