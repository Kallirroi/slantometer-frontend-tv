I WENT TO AN ACTING HIGH SCHOOL

THERE.
I WENT TO COLLEGE IN VIRGINIA

955
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
AND ACTUALLY GOT SOME OF MY

956
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000

WITH SOME OF MY BROS AND I

1067
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
CALLED HOME TO CHECK UP ON

1069
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
ANSWERED THE CALL.

1070
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
HE'S THIS 72-YEAR-OLD AMAZING

1071
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
INSANE VIETNAMESE MAN AND HE

1072
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
SAID, OH, I'M VERY UPSET.

1073
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I'M VERY UPSET.

1074
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I SAID WHAT'S THE MATTER, HIP?

1075
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
>> Jimmy: WHAT?

1076
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
>> HIPDANG IS HIS NAME.

1077
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
HE SAYS I'M VERY UPSET.

1078
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I SAID WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1079
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
HE SAID THE CHICKENS ARE GONE.

1080
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
AND SO I SAID, WHAT'S WRONG?

1081
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
HE SAID SOME ANIMAL TOOK THE

1082
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
CHICKENS.
SO I GET MY WIFE ON THE PHONE.

1083
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
THE WIFE GETS ON THE PHONE.

1084
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
SHE GOES DAD!

1085
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
SHE WAS TRYING TO BASICALLY HIDE

1086
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
THE FACT THAT THE CHICKENS HAD

1087
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
BEEN -- THE CHICKEN COOP HAD

1088
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
BEEN RAIDED BY THESE RACCOONS OR
