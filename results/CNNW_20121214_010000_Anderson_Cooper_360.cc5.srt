1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
WRONG KIND OF BEHAVIOR, THAT DO

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
THINGS THAT ABUSE THE SYSTEM,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE NOT ONLY

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
TO PROSECUTE AND TO PUNISH THOSE

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
THAT DO THAT, BUT TO MAKE SURE

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
THAT WE'RE TAKING STEPS TO

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABIDING BY

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
THE HIGHEST STANDARDS, AND

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
>> YOU'LL HEAR MORE FROM DEFENSE

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
SECRETARY LEON PANETTA TOMORROW

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
ON THAT, ON THE IMPACT OF THE

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
BUDGET CUTS, ON THE DEFENSE

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
DEPARTMENT AND WHY HE THINKS IT

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
COULD HURT AMERICA SO MUCH.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
ALL OF THAT COMING UP TOMORROW.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
THANKS SO MUCH, AS ALWAYS, FOR

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
LIVE HERE TONIGHT FROM KABUL,

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
AFGHANISTAN.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
"ANDERSON COOPER 360" STARTS
NOW.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
>>> GOOD EVENING.

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
THE WOMAN BELIEVED TO BE

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIRST CHOICE

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
FOR SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS NO

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
THANKS.
U.N. AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE.

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
SHE WAS THE ONE CAUGHT UP IN THE

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
CONTROVERSY OF HER STATEMENTS

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
FOLLOWING THE MURDER IN LIBYA.

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
THE PRESIDENT STOOD UP FOR HER

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
SAYING ANYONE THAT HAS A PROBLEM

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
WITH HER HAS A PROBLEM WITH HIM.

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
INSTEAD THERE WON'T BE A

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
CONFRONTATION BECAUSE LATE TODAY

37
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
AMBASSADOR RICE TOOK HERSELF OUT

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
OF CONTENTION WRITING THE

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
PRESIDENT THAT SHE'S HONORED TO
BE CONSIDERED FOR THE OFFICE

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
SAYING, QUOTE, I AM FULLY

41
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
CONFIDENT THAT I COULD SERVE OUR

42
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
COUNTRY ABLY AND EFFECTIVELY IN

43
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
THAT ROLE.

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
HOWEVER, IF NOMINATED, I AM NOW

45
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
CONVINCED THAT THE CONFIRMATION

46
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
PROCESS WOULD BE LENGTHY,

47
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
DISRUPT I'VE AND COSTLY.

48
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
THAT TRADE-OFF IS SIMPLY NOT

49
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
WORTH IT TO OUR COUNTRY.

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
SHE SAID MORE TO ABC NEWS.

51
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
>> TODAY I MADE THE DECISION

52
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
THAT IT WAS BEST FOR OUR

53
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
COUNTRY, FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

54
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
THAT I NOT CONTINUE TO BE

55
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
CONSIDERED BY THE PRESIDENT FOR

56
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
SECRETARY OF STATE BECAUSE I

57
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
DIDN'T WANT TO SEE A

58
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
CONFIRMATION PROCESS THAT WAS

59
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
VERY PROLONGED, VERY

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
POLITICIZED, VERY DISTRACTING

61
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
AND VERY DISRUPTIVE BECAUSE

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WE NEED

63
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
TO GET DONE AS A COUNTRY, AND

64
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
THE FIRST SEVERAL MONTHS OF A

65
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
SECOND TERM PRESIDENT'S AGENDA

66
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
IS REALLY THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET

67
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
THE CRUCIAL THINGS DONE.

68
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION

70
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
REFORM, BALANCED DEFICIT

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
REDUCTION, JOB CREATION.

72
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

73
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
TO THE EXTENT THAT MY NAUM NOMIN

74
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
COULD HAVE DELAYED OR

75
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
DISTRACTED, I DIDN'T WANT THAT

76
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
AND I'D MUCH PREFER TO CONTINUE

77
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
DOING WHAT I'M DOING WHICH IS A

78
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
JOB I LOVE AT THE UNITED

79
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
NATIONS.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ACCEPTED HER

80
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
DECISION TO BOW OUT CALLING HER

81
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
AN EXTRAORDINARILY CAPABLE,

82
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
PATRIOTIC AND PASSIONATE PUBLIC

83
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
SERVE ANXIEA

84
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
SERVANT.

85
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
DANA BASH, GLORIA BORGER AND

86
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
DAVID GERGEN.

87
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
WHAF

88
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
WHAT WAS THE PIVOTAL MOMENT?

89
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
>> THE SERIES OF MEETINGS A

90
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ON THE HILL,

91
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
WITH HER CHIEF FOES, BUT MORE

92
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
IMPORTANTLY IT WAS PROBABLY WITH

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A REPUBLICAN WHO HADN'T MADE UP

94
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
HER MIND AND THAT'S SUSAN

95
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
COLLINS.
BY ALL ACCOUNTS THAT MEETING DID

96
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
NOT GO WELL AT ALL BECAUSE,

97
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
ACCORDING TO A SOURCE WHO'S

98
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
FAMILIAR WITH THAT MEETING, SHE

99
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO ANSWER

100
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
REALLY BASIC QUESTIONS AND GOT

101
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
FRUSTRATED AND MAYBE EVEN A

102
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
LITTLE PRICKLY AT SOME OF THE

103
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
BASIC QUESTIONS.
AND AFTER THAT, THE FEELING EVEN

104
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
AMONG SOME DEMOCRATS, WHO TALKED

105
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
TO THESE REPUBLICANS, WAS THEY

106
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
REALLY WEREN'T SURE IF SHE CAN'T

107
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
HANDLE MEETINGS WITH U.S.

108
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
SENATORS, HOW WAS SHE GOING TO

109
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
BE ON THE WORLD STAGE

110
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
REPRESENTING THE U.S. THERE.

111
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
SO THAT DEFINITELY WAS AN ISSUE.

112
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE

113
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
PRESIDENT IN HIS STATEMENT MADE

114
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
CLEAR THAT HE DIDN'T THINK SUSAN

115
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
RICE WAS TREATED FAIRLY.

116
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE WAS

117
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
POLITICS AT PLAY HERE BY

118
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
REPUBLICANS WHO WERE REALLY,

119
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
REALLY ANGRY ABOUT BENGHAZI AND

120
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
SHE ILLUSTRATED THAT, BUT IT WAS

121
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
MORE THAN THAT.

122
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
IT WAS ALSO PERSONALITY DRIVEN

123
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
BECAUSE EVEN DEMOCRATS THINK

124
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THAT SHE'S VERY SMART, VERY

125
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
CAPABLE, BUT MAYBE DOESN'T HAVE

126
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
THE RIGHT PERSONALITY FOR THIS

127
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
JOB.

128
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
>> GLORIA, EARLIER I HEARD YOU

129
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
SAY THAT AMBASSADOR RICE

130
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
PROBABLY UNDERESTIMATED THE

131
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
CLUB.
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?

132
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
>> WELL, THAT WAS FROM A

133
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
DEMOCRAT, VERY CLOSE TO THE

134
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
WHITE HOUSE, WHO SAID THE CLUB

135
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
IS REALLY IMPORTANT ON CAPITOL

136
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
HILL.

137
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
JOHN KERRY IS THE LEADER IN THAT

138
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
CLUB.
JOHN McCAIN LIKES HIM AN AWFUL

139
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
LOT AND WOULD CLEARLY GO ALONG

140
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
WITH THAT NOMINATION.

141
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
ALSO WHEN SHE TRAVELED UP THERE,

142
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
AND SHE WANTED TO GO UP THERE TO

143
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
TALK TO THESE SENATORS, THERE IS

144
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
A SENSE FROM THE SOURCE THAT SHE

145
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
KIND OF OVERESTIMATED HER

146
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
ABILITY TO WOO THEM OVER ON THE

147
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
QUESTION OF BENGHAZI.

148
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I MEAN THAT WAS A REALLY BIG

149
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION FOR HER,

150
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
AND AS DANA JUST POINTED OUT,

151
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
SHE DIDN'T WIN OVER SUSAN

152
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
COLLINS, WHO WAS QUITE IMPORTANT

153
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
TO HER.

154
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
>> AND, DAVID, I MEAN WHAT DO

155
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
YOU MAKE OF THIS?

156
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
IS THIS JUST A SIGN OF HOW

157
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
PARTISAN THINGS HAVE BECOME OR

158
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
WAS IT PRETTY CLEAR AS SOON AS

159
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THE CONTROVERSY OVER BENGHAZI,

160
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
THE COMMENTS BEGAN, THAT IT

161
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN?

162
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
>> I DON'T THINK THIS IS JUST

163
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
ABOUT PARTISANSHIP.

164
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
AND I ALSO, ANDERSON, DON'T

165
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THINK IT'S JUST ABOUT BENGHAZI.

166
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
THAT WAS AN ISSUE, OF COURSE.

167
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
BUT IN THIS CASE THERE ARE A

168
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
NUMBER OF SENATORS ON BOTH SIDES

169
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
OF THE AISLE WHO BELIEVE THAT

170
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
THE UNITED STATES HAS SOME TOUGH

171
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
WORK AHEAD IN INTERNATIONAL

172
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
RELATIONS.

173
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE HAS GOT TO GO

174
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
AND NEGOTIATE WITH THE IRANIANS

175
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T GET INTO A

176
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
CONFLICT OVER THERE.

177
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
AND SOMEONE WITH THE KIND OF

178
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
TOUGHNESS AND AUTHORITY OF A JIM

179
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
BAKER.
AND FRANKLY THERE WAS A SENSE

180
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
ABOUT SUSAN RICE THAT EVEN

181
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
THOUGH SHE IS VERY TALENTED AND

182
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I THINK SHE DID A GENEROUS THING

183
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
TODAY BY WITHDRAWING, SHE REALLY

184
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
WAS LOYAL TO HER PRESIDENT BY

185
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
DOING THAT.

186
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
BUT THERE WAS ALSO A SENSE THAT

187
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE WEIGHT, SHE

188
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
DIDN'T HAVE THE BACKGROUND THAT

189
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
SENATOR KERRY DOES.

190
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
HE IS EXTREMELY SCHOOLED AND

191
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
KNOWS THE ROUGH PARTS OF THE

192
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
WORLD.

193
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
AND THERE WAS A SENSE IN THE

194
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
SENATE, YOU KNOW, THAT PEOPLE

195
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
THERE WOULD JUST BE MORE

196
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
COMFORTABLE WITH HIM

197
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
REPRESENTING THE UNITED STATES.

198
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
>> DAVID, WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS

199
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
SAYS ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA

200
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
HIMSELF?
IT CERTAINLY SEEMED LINE,

201
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST MONTH OR

202
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
SO, THAT HE WAS DIGGING IN HIS

203
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
HEELS, PREPARING FOR A FIGHT?

204
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
>> WELL, IT DID SEEM LIKE THAT,

205
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
AND I -- THERE WAS ALSO -- YOU

206
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS

207
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
REPORTS THAT HE'S BEEN AGONIZING

208
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
OVER THIS CHOICE AND IN A SENSE

209
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
SHE LET HIM OFF.

210
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
SHE RECOGNIZED HIS AGONY AND

211
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
REMOVED IT.

212
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I -- BUT IT'S -- I THINK ONE CAN

213
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
READ INTO THIS THAT HE DOESN'T

214
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
WANT A SERIES OF FIGHTS WITH

215
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
REPUBLICANS ACROSS THE BOARD.

216
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
HE'S GOT A BIG FIGHT ON HIS

217
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
HANDS ON THE FISCAL CLIFF.

218
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
YOU KNOW, IT MAY BE JUST ONE

219
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
STRUGGLE TOO MANY WHEN HE WANTS

220
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
TO GET HIS SECOND TERM OFF AND

221
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
RUNNING, HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE

222
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
ENSNARED LIKE THIS.

223
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
THIS HAPPENS TO PRESIDENTS.

224
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
WE'VE HAD SOME REALLY GOOD

225
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT MADE IT

226
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

227
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I REMEMBER SO WELL THE ICONIC

228
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
FIGURE TED SORENSON WHO WAS

229
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
NOMINATED TO BE CIA CHIEF AND IT

230
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
JUST SORT OF FELL APART AFTER

231
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
TIME.

232
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
TED SORENSON WENT ON TO GREAT

233
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
THINGS AND WILL ALWAYS BE WELL

234
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
REMEMBERED, BUT IT WAS A TOUGH

235
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
CHAPTER IN HIS LIFE.

236
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
>> ANDERSON, YOU WERE JUST

237
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
TALKING ABOUT THE SENATE BEING

238
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
MORE COMFORTABLE WITH JOHN

239
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
KERRY.
I THINK IN A WAY THE PRESIDENT

240
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE

241
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
COMFORTABLE WITH SUSAN RICE.

242
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
SHE'S AN OLD FRIEND OF HIS.

243
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
IT'S NOT THAT HE DOESN'T LIKE

244
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
JOHN KERRY.

245
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
JOHN KERRY HELPED HIM OUT DURING

246
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
THE DEBATES, HE'S KNOWN HIM FOR

247
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
A LONG TIME.

248
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
SUSAN RICE IS A DEAR OLD FRIEND.

249
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE'S ANOTHER

250
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
ISSUE HERE WHICH IS THE QUESTION

251
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
OF DIVERSITY, BECAUSE IF IT SORT

252
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
OF ALL STACKS UP, AS WE THINK

253
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
IT'S GOING, IT LOOKS LIKE THE

254
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
TOP FOUR CABINET POSTS CAN NOW

255
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
POTENTIALLY BE FILLED BY MEN,

256
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
AND I'M SURE THAT THAT'S

257
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
SOMETHING THE WHITE HOUSE REALLY

258
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
IS THINKING ABOUT.

259
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
>> AND, DANA, THIS TEAM THAT

260
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
LOOKED TO BE FALLING INTO PLACE,

261
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
CHUCK HAGUEL, THE REPUBLICAN FOR

262
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
DEFENSE TO REPLACE PANETTA, DOES

263
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
IT SEEM LIKE A TEAM THAT COULD

264
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
MAKE IT THROUGH THE CONFIRMATION

265
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
IN THE SENATE IF JOHN KERRY IS

266
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
INVOLVED?
>> IT DOES, UNLESS THERE'S

267
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
SOMETHING THAT WE JUST DON'T

268
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
KNOW ABOUT, FOR EXAMPLE, THE

269
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
FORMER SENATE MAJORITY LEADER,

270
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
TOM DASCHLE, CERTAINLY A VERY

271
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
IMPORTANT MEMBER OF THE CLUB,

272
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
THE SENATE CLUB, HE DIDN'T MAKE

273
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
IT THROUGH BECAUSE THERE WAS A

274
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
SURPRISE ISSUE WITH HIS TAX

275
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
RETURNS FOUR YEARS AGO.

276
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
WITH REGARD TO JOHN KERRY, EVEN

277
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
THE REPUBLICAN LEADER LATE TODAY

278
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
SAID KIND WORDS ABOUT HIM.

279
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
IT IS -- IT IS VIRTUALLY SURE

280
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
THAT HE IS GOING TO GET THROUGH

281
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
THE SENATE BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN

282
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
VETTED IN MANY WAYS BECAUSE HE

283
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
WAS THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

284
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
YOU DON'T GET MORE VETTED THAN

285
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
THAT.

286
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
WITH REGARD TO CHUCK HAGUEL,

287
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
SAME THING.

288
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
HE IS SOMEBODY WHO MAYBE DIDN'T

289
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
HAVE THE CLOSEST RELATIONSHIPS

290
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
HERE, BUT THE FACT THAT IT WOULD

291
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
BE A BIPARTISAN PICK BECAUSE HE

292
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
IS A REPUBLICAN WILL GO A LONG

293
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
WAY.
THE ONE THING I WILL SAY ABOUT

294
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
SUSAN RICE IS THAT THE PRESIDENT

295
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
IS LOOKING TO HER TO BE MAYBE

296
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
HIS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER.

297
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S MORE

298
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
INHERENTLY POLITICAL, IT'S A JOB

299
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE, AND MORE

300
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
IMPORTANTLY SHE WOULDN'T NEED

301
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
SENATE CONFIRMATION.

302
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.

303
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
>>> HIGH STAKES WHEN IT COMES TO

304
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
THE TAXES YOU PAY, THE SIZE OF

305
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
GOVERNMENT, THE ECONOMY, THE

306
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
WORKS.

307
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HOUSE
SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER BACK AT IT

308
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
MEETING TONIGHT TRYING ONCE

309
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
AGAIN TO REACH A DEAL ON THE

310
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
FISCAL CLIFF.
THE QUESTION IS, WILL IT BE ANY

311
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
DIFFERENT THIS TIME?

312
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
LET'S CHECK IN RIGHT NOW REQUEST

313
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
W JESSICA YELLIN.

314
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
>> Reporter: WELL, TONIGHT THE
TWO MEN MET FOR 50 MINUTES IN

315
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
THE OVAL OFFICE AS THEY STRUGGLE

316
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THIS

317
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
STALEMATE AND SO MAR NO WORD OF

318
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
A BREAK-THROUGH.

319
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
AIDES TO BOTH MEN DESCRIBED THE

320
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
CONVERSATION AS FRANK AND WE'RE

321
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
TOLD THAT LINES OF COMMUNICATION

322
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
REMAIN OPEN.
NOW, THAT IS POLITICAL SPEAK,

323
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
AND I WILL TRANSLATE IT FOR YOU.

324
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
FRANK, THAT GENERALLY MEANS THAT

325
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
THE CONVERSATION WAS SOMEWHAT

326
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
TENSE.

327
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
LINES OF COMMUNICATION REMAINS

328
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
OPEN, THAT MEANS THAT THE TWO

329
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
MEN'S STAFF WILL CONTINUE

330
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
TALKING.
AND IN FACT I'VE CONFIRMED THAT

331
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
THERE IS NO CURRENT PLAN FOR THE

332
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
TWO MEN, THE PRESIDENT AND

333
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER, TO HAVE A

334
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
FOLLOW-UP MEETING AS OF YET.

335
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
AND SPEAKER BOEHNER DOES PLAN TO

336
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
RETURN HOME TO OHIO TOMORROW.

337
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
NOW, THAT'S A CHALLENGE BECAUSE

338
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
FOR A DEAL TO COME TOGETHER

339
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
BECAUSE THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF

340
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
TIME.
THEY ARE ALL BUT OUT OF TIME TO

341
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
GET A DEAL DONE BEFORE THE

342
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
CHRISTMAS DEADLINE, AND NEXT TO

343
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
OUT OF TIME TO GET ONE DONE

344
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
BEFORE THE NEW YEAR.

345
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
NOW, WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING, FOR

346
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
THE TWO MEN, THEIR FUNDAMENTAL

347
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
DEMANDS HAVE NOT CHANGED.

348
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER IS LOOKING FOR

349
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
THE PRESIDENT TO DO MORE ON

350
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
SPENDING CUTS.

351
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
THE PRESIDENT LOOKING FOR THE

352
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
GOP TO AGREE TO RAISE RATES ON

353
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
THE TOP 2%.

354
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
SO FAR NEITHER SIDE HAS GIVEN --

355
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
THE REPUBLICANS WE UNDERSTAND

356
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
HAVE NOT GIVEN ON THE RATES.

357
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
THE PRESIDENT HASN'T GIVEN

358
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
ENOUGH ON THE SPENDING CUTS FOR

359
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
THE REPUBLICANS TO BE HAPPY.

360
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
SO, AGAIN, WE ARE AT STALEMATE.

361
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
WE ARE TOLD THAT THE REPUBLICANS

362
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
IN CONGRESS, SOME OF THEM HAVE

363
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
BEEN ASKED TO CANCEL THEIR

364
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
VACATIONS AND PLAN TO BE HERE

365
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
FOR AT LEAST PART OF THE

366
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
HOLIDAYS.
SO, SO FAR NOT A LOT OF PROGRESS

367
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
TO REPORT.

368
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
ANDERSON.
>> JESSICA, THANKS VERY MUCH.

369
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
KNEW IT HAD A PROBLEM, WAS

547
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
WARNED ABOUT IT AND DID NOT FIX

548
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
IT.
>> THEY WERE NOT CLEANING THE

549
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
FLOZELW CELLS, NOT DOING THE THS

550
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
NECESSARY FOR THE EFFICACY OF

551
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
THE SYSTEM.
>> DID YOU TELL THE HOSPITAL?

552
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
>> YES, WE DID.

553
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
YES, WE DID.
WE TOLD THEM -- WE ACTUALLY HAD

554
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
TWO AUDITS AND TOLD THEM TWICE

555
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
THAT THEY WERE DEFICIENT IN

556
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
THEIR MAINTENANCE.

557
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
>> WHAT IS SO FRUSTRATING IS IF

558
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
THE SYSTEM HAD JUST BEEN

559
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
MAINTAINED, IF THE HOSPITAL HAD

560
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
JUST LISTENED AND MADE SIMPLE

561
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
ADJUSTMENTS, HE SAYS HE BELIEVES

562
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED.

563
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

564
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
ABSOLUTELY.
>> 100%?

565
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
>> 100%.

566
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
>> AS IS DONE IN ALL THE OTHER

567
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
HOSPITALS THAT YOU SERVICE?

568
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
>> YES.
>> THIS OUTBREAK WAS ABSOLUTELY

569
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
PREVENTIBLE.
>> DR. JANET STOUT WITH HER

570
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
COLLEAGUE, DR. VICTOR YU WORKED

571
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS AT THIS

572
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
SAME PITTSBURGH VA HOSPITAL

573
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
RESEARCHING LEGIONNAIRE'S

574
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
DISEASE.

575
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
THEY WERE PIONEERS IN THE FIELD,

576
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
DEVELOPING THE COPPER SILVER

577
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
IONIZATION FILTRATION SYSTEM

578
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
WHICH IS STILL BEING USED AS

579
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
PITTSBURGH'S VA AND IN HOSPITALS

580
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
NATIONWIDE.
SIX YEARS AGO IN A CONTROVERSIAL

581
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
MOVE, THE DOCTORS AND THEIR

582
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
LEGIONELLA RESEARCH LAB WERE

583
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
TOLD BY THE VA THAT THEIR

584
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
SERVICES WERE NOT PRODUCTIVE AND

585
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
A DRAIN ON CLINICAL RESOURCES.

586
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
THE DOCTORS SAY FOR A DECADE

587
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
BEFORE THEY LEFT, NOT A SINGLE

588
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
PATIENT GOT LEGIONNAIRE'S FROM

589
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
THE HOSPITAL'S WATER.

590
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
SHE SAYS IF SHE WERE STILL THERE

591
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
MONITORING THE WATER, THIS

592
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
STWI
ENTIRE TRAGEDY WOULD HAVE BEEN

593
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
PREVENTED WITH THE TURN OF A

594
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
KNOB.
>> SO THIS IS NOT, AS THEY SAY,

595
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
ROCKET SCIENCE.
THIS IS STRAIGHTFORWARD.

596
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
>> SO WHAT WENT WRONG?

597
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
OUR CALLS AND E-MAILS TO THE VA

598
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
WENT UNANSWERED, SO KEEPING THEM

599
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
HONEST, WE WENT TO THE UNITED

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
HOSPITAL IN PITTSBURGH IN HOPES

602
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
OF GETTING ANSWERS.

603
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
WE WERE MET BY FOUR ARMED

604
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
FEDERAL OFFICERS.
>> HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

605
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
DREW GRIFFIN WITH CNN.

606
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
>> WE'RE WITH THE VA POLICE.

607
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
>> YES, SIR.

608
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
>> THIS HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY

OUR PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICE.

610
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I CANNOT ALLOW YOU ON THE
PROPERTY.

611
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
>> DO YOU WANT TO CALL THEM AND

612
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
SEE IF THEY WANT TO COME OUT?

613
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
>> CAN YOU TAKE THE CAMERA BACK

614
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
ACROSS THE STATE UNTIL YOU HAVE

615
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
AUTHORIZATION.
>> HOLD ON, I'M ON THE PHONE

616
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
WITH THEM.

617
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
>> AFTER YET REACHING JUST A

618
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
MESSAGE MACHINE, THE OFFICER

619
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
TOLD US TO LEAVE.

620
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
>> WHO TOLD YOU TO KICK US OFF

621
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
OF HERE?

622
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
>> IT'S OUR POLICY ACTUALLY.

623
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
>> YOUR POLICY?

624
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
WE CAN'T STAND ON UNITED STATES

625
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
GOVERNMENT LAND WITH A CAMERA?

626
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
>> WITHOUT A LEGITIMATE PURPOSE

627
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
FOR BEING HERE.

628
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
>> I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT WHY

629
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
THESE PATIENTS DIED.

630
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000

ASK YOU TO LEAVE UNTIL IT'S

633
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
APPROVED BY OUR PUBLIC AFFAIRS

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
QUESTIONS, THE VA SPOKESPERSON

636
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
HAS RELEASED THREE MEDIA

637
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
ADVISORIES, THE LAST ONE ON THE

638
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
DAY WE VISITED READ IN A VOICE

639
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
MAIL.
>> VA IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING

640
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
SAFE FACILITIES AND QUALITY CARE

641
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
FOR VETERANS.
>> THE ADVISORY GOES ON TO SAY

642
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
THAT AN INVESTIGATION IS UNDER

643
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
WAY AND THAT --

644
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
>> TESTING RESULTS INDICATE THE

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
REMEDIATION AT PITTSBURGH VA

646

MEDICAL CENTER UNIVERSITY DRIVE

647
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

648
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
>> BILL NICHOLAS' FLAG STILL

649
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
FLIES ON THE FRONT LAWN THAT HE

650
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
MOWED HIMSELF.

651
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
HE WOULD HAVE TURNED 88 THIS

652
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
PAST WEEKEND.

653
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
INSTEAD OF CELEBRATING HIS

654
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
BIRTHDAY, HIS FAMILY HELD A

655
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
MEMORIAL SERVICE.

656
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
>> THEY SHOULD HAVE THE BEST AND

657
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
UTMOST CARE THAT ANYBODY ELSE

658
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
SHLGS EVEN BETTER THAN A NORMAL

659
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
CIVILIAN.
THEY FOUGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY,

660
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
THEY GO TO BATTLE, YOU KNOW,

661
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY AND

662
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
WHERE DO THEY GO?

663
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
THEY GO TO A HOSPITAL AND THEY

664
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
BASICALLY DIE IN THERE.

665
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
>> ANDERSON, LET ME TELL YOU

666
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

667
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
BILL NICHOLAS.

668
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
THIS GUY, DRAFTED AT 17 YEARS

669
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
OLD INTO THE U.S. NAVY.

670
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
HE WOULD DRIVE 30 MILES OUT OF

671
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
HIS WAY PAST TWO OTHER HOSPITALS

672
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
JUST TO GO TO THE VA, BECAUSE HE

673
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
THOUGHT HE WOULD GET BETTER CARE

674
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
THERE AS A VETERAN, WHICH IS WHY

675
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
HIS SONS REALLY FEEL LET DOWN BY

676
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
THIS.

677
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
>> YOU SAID IN YOUR PIECE WE

678
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
KNOW OF THREE POSSIBLE DEATHS

679
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
DUE TO THIS LEGION ELLA AT THE

680
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
HOSPITAL, BUT THERE ACTUALLY

681
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
COULD BE MORE DEATHS, RIGHT?

682
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
>> CERTAINLY.

683
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
ALL THE INFORMATION ON THESE

684
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
CASES, 29 CASES, IS COMING FROM

685
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
THE HOSPITAL.

686
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A

687
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
YEAR NOW, ANDERSON.

688
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I THINK A LOT OF HEALTH CARE

689
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
PROFESSIONALS, A LOT OF

690
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
FAMILIES, QUITE FRANKLY, ARE

691
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
GOING TO LOOK BACK OVER THIS

692
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
YEAR, LOOK BACK AT THE FAMILY

693
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
MEMBERS THEY MAY HAVE LOST, AND

694
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
BEGIN ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT

695
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
WHAT THIS WAS THAT KILLED THEIR

696
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
LOVED ONE.
COULD IT HAVE BEEN THIS

697
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE.
>> AND WHO BESIDES US ARE TRYING

698
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
TO GET ANSWERS ON THIS?

699
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
IS THE VA STILL REFUSING TO TALK

700
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
TO YOU?
>> YEAH, THEY WILL NOT COME OUT.

701
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
AS YOU SAW IN THAT PIECE, THEY

702
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
WON'T TALK TO US AT ALL.

703
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
THE VA IN PITTSBURGH REFERRED US

704
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
TO THE WASHINGTON PR DIVISION

705
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
WHO SENT US RIGHT BACK TO

706
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
PITTSBURGH.

707
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
IT'S BEEN A MESS.
BUT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE

708
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
CONTROL AND PREVENTION, THEY DID
SEND A TEAM THERE IN NOVEMBER TO

709
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
INVESTIGATE THIS.

710
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
WE'RE TOLD THAT THE

711
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
INVESTIGATION, THE RESULTS FROM

712
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
THE CDC WILL GO TO THE VA IN THE

713
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
COMING WEEKS.
WE'RE NOT SURE IF THAT'S GOING

714
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
TO BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC.

715
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
>> I STILL CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY

716
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
THE VA DID NOTHING WHEN THEY

717
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
KNEW THEY HAD A PROBLEM?

718
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
>> ACTUALLY, ANDERSON, WE FOUND

719
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
OUT THAT ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO

720
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
THE VA DID BRING IN A CONSULTANT

721
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
WHO MADE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW

722
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
TO FIX THE WATER, BUT THE VA DID

723
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
NOT TELL THAT CONSULTANT THAT

724
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
THEY HAD LEGIONNAIRE'S CASES AT

725
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
THE HOSPITAL.
IF THEY HAD TOLD THE CONSULTANTS

726
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN

727
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS.

728
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000

00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
MEDICINE AGAIN.
IN 2010 A CANADIAN JURY FAILED

1076
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
TO CONVICT HIM OF THE MURDERS,

1077
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
FINDING HIM NOT CRIMINALLY

1078
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
RESPONSIBLE DUE TO MENTAL I

1079
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
ILLNESS.
HE KILLED HIS CHILDREN ON WHAT

1080
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A FAMILY

1081
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
MOVIE NIGHT.

1082
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
THIS SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWS

1083
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
HIM RENTING VIDEOS WITH HIS

1084
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
CHILDREN JUST HOURS BEFORE HE

1085
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
BRUTALLY STABBED THEM IN HIS

1086
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
BED.
THESE WERE TROUBLING TIMES FOR

1087
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
THE DOCTOR.

1088
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
HE WAS SEPARATED FROM HIS WIFE.

1089
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
SHE HAD LEFT HIM FOR ANOTHER

1090
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
MAN.
HE SAID HE SUFFERED A BLACKOUT

1091
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
AND DOES NOT REMEMBER STABBING

1092
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
THE CHILDREN.
THE VERDICT IS BEING APPEALED.

1093
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
>> DO YOU BELIEVE HE WAS

1094
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
MENTALLY INSANE WHEN HE

1095
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
COMMITTED THE MURDERS, AND DO

1096
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
YOU BELIEVE HE'S MENTALLY INSANE

1097
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
NOW?
>> NO, NO.

1098
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
>> WHY?

1099
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
>> WHY SHOULD I, THAT I DON'T

1100
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
ACCEPT HE IS MENTALLY ILL, WHEN

1101
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I LOOK AT THE FACTS, OKAY.

1102
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
WE HAVE A PERSON THAT'S A

1103
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
CARDIOLOGIST THAT HAS NEVER HAD

1104
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
A PSYCHIATRIC INCIDENT, NEVER,

1105
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
NOT AT ALL.

1106
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
>> THE JURY BELIEVED THE

1107
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
TESTIMONY OF TWO PSYCHIATRISTS

1108
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
PRESENTED BY THE DEFENSE.

1109
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
THEY TESTIFIED THAT THE DOCTOR

1110
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN WHAT HE WAS

1111
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
DOING WHEN HE REPEATEDLY STABBED

1112
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
5-YEAR-OLD OLIVIER AND

1113
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
3-YEAR-OLD ANN-SOPHIE.

1114
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
>> I'M A LITTLE BIT MAD BECAUSE

1115
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I HAVE TO RESPECT THEIR

1116
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
DECISION, SO IT CONFRONTS ME AND

1117
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
MY VALUES, BUT I THINK THEY

1118
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
DIDN'T DO THEIR JOB.

1119
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
>> Reporter: THE DOCTOR IS NOW A

1120
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
FREE MAN WITH NO CRIMINAL

1121
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
RECORD, AND HE SAYS HE'S NOT

1122
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
TAKING ANY MEDICATION FOR MENTAL

1123
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
ILLNESS.
THE ONLY CONDITIONS OF HIS

1124
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
RELEASE ARE THAT HE CONTINUE

1125
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
WITH THERAPY AND STAY AWAY FROM

1126
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
HIS EX-WIFE AND HER FAMILY.

1127
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
HE MUST ALSO GO BEFORE THE

1128
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
REVIEW PANEL THAT RELEASED HIM

1129
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
IN A YEAR.

1130
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS

1131
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
CURRENTLY TREATING THE DOCTOR

1132
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
AND THE PSYCHIATRIC EXPERTS WHO

1133
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
GAVE TESTIMONY AT HIS TRIAL HAVE

1134
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
TOLD CNN THEY DO NOT WISH TO

1135
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
COMMENT ON THE CASE.

1136
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
DR. GASTON SAYS SHE FEARS FOR

1137
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
HER LIFE NOW, AND BELIEVES THE

1138
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
PSYCHIATRISTS THAT TESTIFIED ON

1139
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
HIS BEHALF DID NOT EVALUATE HIM

1140
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
LONG ENOUGH.
SHE IS CALLING FOR STRICTER

1141
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
GUIDELINES WHEN PSYCHIATRIC

1142
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
TESTIMONY IS PRESENTED IN COURT.

1143
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
SHE SAYS SHE HAS NEVER BELIEVED

1144
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
HER EX-HUSBAND WAS MENTALLY ILL,

1145
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
AND EVEN IF HE WAS, HE COULD NOT

1146
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
NOW BE CURED IN LITTLE MORE THAN

1147
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
THREE YEARS.

1148
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
>> WHAT I'M SAYING, I HAVE

1149
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
QUESTION.
I'M A MOTHER BUT I'M ALSO A

1150
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
DOCTOR.

1151
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
>> YOU HOPE IT WILL HELP OTHER

1152
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
VICTIMS IN THE FUTURE?

1153
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
>> YES, I HOPE.

1154
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M VERY

1155
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
CONVINCED.
I'M WILLING TO LOSE MY HEALTH,

1156
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I'M WILLING TO LOSE MY ECONOMY

1157
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
STATUS, I'M WILLING TO LOSE MY

1158
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
PROFESSIONAL STATUS, I'M WILLING

1159
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
TO LOSE MY LIFE.

1160
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'M WILLING TO GO VERY FAR IN

1161
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
THIS BATTLE.

1162
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
AND I'M REALLY, REALLY CONVINCED

1163
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
THAT IT HAS TO CHANGE.

1164
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
>> DID YOU EVER ASK HIM WHY HE

1165
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
DID IT?
>> I WANTED TO ASK HIM, BUT, YOU

1166
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
KNOW, THE RESPONSE THAT HE'S

1167
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
GOING TO GIVE ME, IF HE DOESN'T

1168
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
TELL ME THE TRUTH, THAT IS MY

1169
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
TRUTH THAT I KNOW IS FOR

1170
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
VENGEANCE, YOU KNOW.

1171
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
HE WILL INVENT EVERYTHING, AND

1172
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
THAT'S WHAT HE DID IN COURT, YOU

1173
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
KNOW.
>> AND DR. GASTON SAYS SHE

1174
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
BELIEVES IT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT

1175
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
TEST CASE TO POSSIBLY LIMIT

1176
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
CLAIMS OF MENTAL INSANITY AND

1177
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
BETTER SCRUTINIZE THE MEDICAL

1178
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
EVIDENCE NEEDED TO PROVE IT.

1179
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
>> THAT IS SUCH A HORRIFIC

1180
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
CRIME.
PAULA NEWTON JOINS ME NOW.

1181
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
PAULA, WHAT'S BEEN THE REACTION

1182
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
TO THIS RELEASE?

1183
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
>> Reporter: OUTRAGE REALLY

1184
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, FELT

1185
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
MOST ACUTELY HERE IN MONTREAL

1186
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
HERE TODAY, ANDERSON.

1187
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT.

1188
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
THE OUTRAGE STEMS FROM TWO

1189
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
THING.
ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE

1190
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
HEADLINES, LOOK, ANDERSON, THIS

1191
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
GUY STABBED HIS CHILDREN 46

1192
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
TIMES, HE CONFESSED TO IT.

1193
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
HE SERVED 46 MONTHS, NOT ALL OF

1194
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
IT IN PRISON.

1195
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
HE IS A FREE MAN RIGHT NOW.

1196
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
ADD TO THAT THAT THE MENTAL

1197
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
FACILITY ACTUALLY SAID, LOOK,

1198
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
THIS GUY DOES PRESENT A RISK TO

1199
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
SOCIETY.
WE DON'T KNOW HOW HE'LL BEHAVE

1200
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
IN THE FUTURE, BUT HE NEEDS TO

1201
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
BE FREE AND WE CAN MANAGE THAT

1202
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
RISK.
ANDERSON, I'LL REMIND YOU, THERE

1203
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
WILL BE NO POLICE OFFICER

1204
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
FOLLOWING HIM AROUND.

1205
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
NOT ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
AND THE PUBLIC WANTS TO KNOW

1206
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
WHY.
>> I MEAN THAT'S JUST

1207
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
INCREDIBLE.
FOR SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME

1208
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
THAT HE ACTUALLY WAS IN THIS

1209
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY.

1210
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
WHAT IS NEXT FOR HIM?

1211
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
>> Reporter: WELL, THIS IS THE

1212
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
OTHER OUTRAGEOUS THING PEOPLE

1213
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
ARE TELLING ME.
IN HIS TESTIMONY AS TO WHY HE

1214
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
WANTED TO BE RELEASED, HE SAID

1215
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
HE WANTED TO LEAD A NORMAL LIFE.

1216
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
HE'S GOING TO APPLY AGAIN TO

1217
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
PRACTICE MEDICINE.

1218
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
HE IS A CARDIOLOGIST, HE DOESN'T

1219
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS AGAINST HIM

1220
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF CARE HE

1221
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
HAD FOR HIS PATIENTS.

1222
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
HE IS FREE TO BE A DOCTOR AGAIN

1223
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
IF HE GETS LICENSED ONCE MORE.

1224
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000

IN THE NEW YEAR.

1228

1229
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
WE'LL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW IT.

1230
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
