OSCAR.

ANYWAY.

574
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
IT'S AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE.

575

AND I DID TOGETHER.

577
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000

IS IT SOMETHING YOU HAD

594
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
COMMITTED TO MEMORY?

595

MATE GRUBBY.

597
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
>> Jimmy: WHAT?

598
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
>> HE'S NAME IS BRIAN BUT HIS

599
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
NICKNAME IS GRUBBY.

600
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
THE NICKNAMES ARE CRUEL.

601
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
>> Jimmy: LIKE WHAT?

602
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
>> A KID AT OUR SCHOOL HAD A CAR

603
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
ACCIDENT.

604
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
IT WAS TOUCH AND GO FOR A WHILE.

605
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
HE WAS IN A COMA AND THERE WERE

606
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
PEOPLE PRAYING AND DOING THIS

607
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
THING AND WILL HE COME BACK?

608
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
HE CAME BACK AND WE WERE NOT

609
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
SURE IF HE WAS COMING BACK IN

610
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
THE SAME SHAPE THAT HE LEFT.

611
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
WHEN HE CAME BACK SIX MONTHS

612
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
LATER.

613
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
IT APPEARED HE WAS GETTING

614
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
BETTER.

615
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
BUT FROM THE MOMENT HE ARRIVED

616
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
BACK AT SCHOOL HE WAS CALLED

617
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
DAMAGE.
>> Jimmy: IT COULD HAVE BEEN

618
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
WORSE.
DAMAGE, HUH?

619
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
>> DAMAGE, WELCOME BACK.

620
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
IT WAS WORSE FOR ME.

621
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
>> Jimmy: WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

622
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
>> DO YOU REMEMBER THE SHOW "V"?

623
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
>> AND THEY TRIED TO BRING IT

624
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
BACK HERE AT ABC.

625
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
>> I GOT IN A HOT SWEAT WHEN I

626
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
SAW IT.

627
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
THEY HAD A MARK HERE IN THE

628
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
SHAPE OF THE V.

629
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
THAT DISTINGUISHED THEM AS

630
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
ALIENS.
I WOKE UP AT THE AGE OF 14 WITH

631
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
ACNE IN THE SHAPE OF A V FOR A

632
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
MONTH EVERY DAY.

633
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
COULD NOT GET RID OF IT AS THE

634
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
SHOW IS PEAKING AND EVERYONE IS

635
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
YELLING YO, V, WELCOME TO SCHOOL

WHAT UP, ALIEN.

638
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
>> Jimmy: WHY DID YOU CALL HIM

639
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
GRUBBY?

640
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
>> HE WAS VERY SLICK.

641
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
>> Jimmy: AN OPPOSITE THING.

642
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
LIKE WHEN YOU CALL A FAT GUY

643

00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
THIS SHOOTS CANNON BALLS OF

919
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
WATER.
>> Jimmy: A BALL OF WATER.

920
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
>> A BALL OF WATER SHOOTING AT

921
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
YOU.

922
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
>> Jimmy: HOW HARD DOES IT COME

923
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
AT YOU?
>> SO HARD.

924
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
SO HARD.

925
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
>> Jimmy: AND SOMEONE FIRING

926
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
THESE?
>> THERE'S A GUY LIKE YOU KNOW

927
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
HE'S GOT AN INTENSE LOOK ON HIS

928
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
FACE AND THE BOAT'S ABOUT TO

929
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
COME UP TO HIM.

930
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
>> Jimmy: AND YOU HAVE TO

931
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW IT'S

932
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
HAPPENING.
>> OH -- AND YOU ARE HIT WITH

933
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
THIS WATER.

934
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
SO AS A BACKGROUND PERFORMER YOU

935
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
ARE NOT TREATED REALLY WELL.

936
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
>> Jimmy: NO.
>> I DON'T REMEMBER EATING ANY

937
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
FOOD OR USING THE RESTROOM OR

938
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
LEAVING THIS BOAT.

939
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I WAS JUST IN THIS BOAT THE

940
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
WHOLE TIME.

941
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
AND I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM

942
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
SO BAD.
>> Jimmy: OH, NO.

943
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
>> AND I'M DRENCHED AND COLD AND

944
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
IT'S THE LAST SHOT AND THE GUY

945
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
SITTING NEXT TO ME I GUESS HE

946
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
HAD BEEN GETTING HIT WITH THE

947
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
WATER CANNON INTENSELY.

948
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
AND HE HAD HAD ENOUGH.

949
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
SO ON THE LAST ROUND I NOTICE AS

950
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
THE WATER CANNON GOES OFF THE

951
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
GUY NEXT TO ME GOES LIKE THIS

952
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
AND I GET THE FULL BRUNT OF THE

953
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
CANNON RIGHT IN MY CHEST.

954
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
AND -- I'M NOT -- LET ME JUST

955
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
SAY I'M NOT SAYING I PEED MY

956
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
PANTS BUT I CAN'T HAVE TO GO TO

957
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
THE BATHROOM ANY MORE.

958
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
>> Jimmy: WATER BEGAT WATER.

959
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
WERE YOU EXCITED WHEN YOU SAW IT

960
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
ON TELEVISION?

961
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
>> OH, JIMMY.

962
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
NO.

963
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
>> Jimmy: WHY?

964
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
>> WELL, I DID MANAGE TO TAPE

965
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
IT.

966
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
AND THIS WAS BACK WHEN THERE

967
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
WERE VCRs AND YOU COULD GO FRAME

968
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
BY FRAME AND I WAS IN TWO FRAMES

969
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
UP IN THE CORNER.

970
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
AND AT CHRISTMAS TIME I MADE THE

971
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
ENTIRE EXTENDED FAMILY GATHER

972
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
AROUND THE TELEVISION AND SHOWED

973
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
THEM MY TWO FRAMES.

974
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
>> Jimmy: YOU SHOULD FIND

975
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
WHOEVER DIRECTED THAT VIDEO AND

976
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
PUNISH HIM.

977
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
>> I HAVE RIDDEN THE RIDE SINCE.

978
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
14 YEARS LATER I WENT BACK AND

979
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
TOOK MY NEPHEW.

980
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
AND YOU DON'T GET WET AT ALL.

981
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
IT'S LIKE A SPRINKLE OF NOTHING.

982
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
IT'S LIKE MISTING OF WATER.

983
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
THERE'S NO WATER ON THIS RIDE AT

984
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
ALL.
>> Jimmy: THAT'S FALSE

985
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
ADVERTISING.

986
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THOSE

987
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
CLEAR RAIN PARKAS IN LINE.

988
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
THEY ARE ALL LIKE AFRAID THEY

989
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
WILL BE DRENCHED ALL DAY.

990
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
>> Jimmy: WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR

991
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
THE HOLIDAYS?

992
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

993
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
>> GOING HOME TO ST. LOUIS.

994
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
TO SEE MY FOLKS.

995
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
MY HUSBAND AND THE BABY --

996
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
>> Jimmy: I HAVE BEEN TO ST.

997
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
LOUIS A BUNCH OF TIMES.

998
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
YOUR MOM WAS MY FIANCE'S

999
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
TEACHER.

1000
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
SHE IS ONLY 14 YEARS OLD, MY

1001
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
FIANCE.
IT'S A JOKE.

1002
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
BUT IT'S -- THAT'S A WEIRD

1003
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
THING.

1004
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
AND DO YOU HAVE SPOTS YOU GO TO

1005
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
THE EAT?

1006
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
>> EMO'S PIZZA.

1007
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
>> Jimmy: CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

1008
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
IT'S THE MOST DISGUSTING PIZZA

1009
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
EVER.
IT'S THE WORST PIZZA I HAVE EVER

1010
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
HAD IN MY LONG -- ILLUSTRIOUS

1011
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
PIZZA EATING CAREER.

1012
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
AND EVERYONE FROM ST. LOUIS

1013
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
LOVES IT.

1014
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
WHY?

1015
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
>> I HOPE YOU HAD IT DELIVERED.

1016
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
IT GETS PLASTICY AND THAT'S WHEN

1017
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
IT IS THE BEST.

1018
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
>> Jimmy: REALLY?

1019
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
THAT'S A GREAT SLOGAN.

1020
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
IT WAS PLASTICY.

1021
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
>> THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT GOOD.

1022
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
>> Jimmy: NO.

1023
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
BUT IT WAS PLASTICY.

1024
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
IT'S A WEIRD THING.

1025
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000

1028
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
WE HAD THANKSGIVING DINNER AND I

1030
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I HAD ONE DAY IN TOWN.
