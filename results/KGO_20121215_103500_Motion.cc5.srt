BE A LITTLE BIGGER

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
THOUSAND TO TEN
THOUSAND AS A BASE.

BUT DESIGNER DWIGHT
TELLS ME WE CAN PULL

ABSOLUTELY RECREATE THIS
FOR ALL YOUR DINNER GUEST.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
THE FIRST PLACE TO SAVE

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
TONS THAT TABLE CLOTH.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
IT'S ACTUALLY A BED SHEET.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
AND I TELL PEOPLE IF YOU
DON'T HAVE FINE IMPORTED

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
LINENS ITS NO BIG DEAL.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
YOU CAN TAKE A BED SHEET,
AND I'VE USED IT MANY

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
TIMES, AND NO ONE EVER KNOWS.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
THIS IS KEY.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH A

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
BED SHEET THAT HAS A LOW

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THREAD COUNT BY LAYING

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
FELT ON THE TABLE FIRST IT

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
WILL IMPROVE THE WAY THE SHEET

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
DRAPES AND HANGS ON THE TABLE.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
WHERE DO YOU GET FELT?

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
ANY FABRIC STORE
WILL HAVE IT.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
THIS RAN ME MAYBE FOUR OR

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
THREE DOLLARS A YARD, AND WE'RE
WORKING WITH THREE YARDS HERE.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
HE DRESSES THE BED

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
SHEET WITH THE OVERLAY.

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
WHAT IS THIS?
ITS ALMOST LIKE A CORSET.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THAT'S INTERESTING YOU
PICKED UP ON THAT.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
THAT'S THE INSPIRATION

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
BEHIND THIS OVERLAY.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I LIKE USING VELUM
BECAUSE THE TRANSPARENCY

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
THAT IT HAS.

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
OR WANT TO BUY IT YOU CAN
ACHIEVE THE LOOK WITH

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
PLAIN OLD PRINTER PAPER.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
YOU'VE GOT TO START

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
WITH A TEMPLATE FIRST.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
THIS IS WHAT I MADE

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
FOR THIS TABLE.

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
THIS IS PRETTY EXTENSIVE.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I DO HAVE AN ARCHITECTURAL
BACKGROUND THAT MIGHT BE WHY IT

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
LOOKS MORE TECHNICAL THAN IT IS.

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
YOU DECIDE HOW MANY

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
PANELS YOU WANT THE
OVERLAY TO HAVE.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
THEN YOUR IN WORK ON EACH SIDE,

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
THAT TELLS ME WHAT SIZE EACH

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
VELUM PANEL NEEDS TO BE.

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
PUNCH WHOLES IN TO LACE

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
THE RIBBON THROUGH, ITS
IMPORTANT YOU START WITH

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THE CORNERS BECAUSE

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
IT LACES TOGETHER.

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
AND ONCE YOU GET THAT DONE

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
YOU DECIDE HOW FAR YOU WANT

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
THE WHOLE TO BE SPACED APART.

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I USUALLY DO ABOUT
TWO INCHES TWO AND

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
A HALF INCHES APART.

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
ONCE YOU GET THE HOLES

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
IN YOU STRING THE RIBBON.

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
ACTUALLY WE SHOULD
HAVE GONE UNDER.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
BECAUSE YOU WANT THE

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
XS TO STAY ON TOP.

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THIS IS WHY I'M HERE.

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
SO I CAN MAKE

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
ALL THE MISTAKES AND
YOU DON'T MAKE THEM.

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
THEN WE LACE UNDER.

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
OH.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
DWIGHT ADVICES DO

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
NOT DO THIS THE SAME
DAY AS THE PARTY.

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I DON'T WANT TO RECEIVE

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
ANY EMAILS SAYING WAIT A
MINUTE THIS IS NOT, YOU

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
MADE IT LOOK A LOT EASIER.

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
YOUR TABLE IT CAN TAKE A
COUPLE DAYS TO DO.

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
THESE GLASSES.

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
THESE ARE JUST JUICE
GLASSES THAT I HAD AROUND

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
THE HOUSE AND I TOOK THEM

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
AND I'M GOING TO USE THEM

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
AS RISERS, AND I FILLED THEM

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
FIRST WITH DRIED SPLIT PEAS.

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
HOW COOL.

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
KIND OF COOL YEAH.

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
HE USES RECYCLED GLASS
FROM AN OLD PIECE OF

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
FURNITURE AS A RISER IN

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE.

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
SMELLS GREAT DOESN'T IT.

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
AND FILLED THEM
WITH COFFEE BEANS.

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
AND LOOK AT THIS, HE
ADDS A BRANCH AS PART

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
OF THE CENTERPIECE.

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
HE GAVE IT A GOOD CLEANING

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
WITH BLEACH AND WATER YOU

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
WOULDN'T WANT UNINVITED

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
GUEST SHOWING
UP AT THE PARTY.

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
WHEN ITS DRIED WE ADD SOME
GOLD WIRE BEADS AND MOSS

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
AROUND IT TO DRESS IT UP A BIT.

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
BUT ITS JUST THAT SIMPLE.

150
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
ITS ALL ABOUT USING

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
WHAT YOU HAVE AT HAND.

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
THIS IS JUST AS YOU CAN
SEE A CABBAGE HEAD, I WILL

153
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
TURN ANYTHING INTO A VASE.

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
YOU KNOW.

155
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
SO I CARVED IT OUT AND BY

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
TAKING LIKE FOAM OASIS
THAT'S BEEN SOAKED IN WATER

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
WE CAN INSERT IT IN THERE.

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
NOW CARVING IT OUT, IS
IT AS SIMPLE AS TAKING

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
A KNIFE ON THE INSIDE.

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
ITS LIKE A PUMPKIN.

161
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
IF YOU TAKE IT AND SPRAY
IT WITH WATER AND PUT IT

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
IN A PLASTIC BAG

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
AND IN YOUR CRISPER FOR A COUPLE

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
DAYS IT WILL HARDEN AND
STAY THIS WAY THAT'S HOW

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
ITS ABLE TO SIT OUT ON THE
TABLE DURING THE DINNER

166
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
PARTY AND NOT WILT.

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
THAT'S THE KEY
RIGHT THERE.

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
THAT'S THE KEY.

169
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I KNEW THERE HAD
TO BE SOMETHING.

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
OKAY COOL.

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
INEXPENSIVE
SUPERMARKET ROSES.

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
THESE ARE SPRAY ROSES,

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I TAKE THEM AND START
INSERTING THEM INTO OUR OASIS.

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
WE ADD GOURDS,
MOSS AND PLACEMATS.

175
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
IT WAS A LONG TWIG RUNNER
THAT I TOOK AND JUST CUT UP

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
INTO PARTS AND MADE

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
OUR PLACEMATS WITH WHITE CHINA

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST WAY
TO STRETCH A DOLLAR.

179
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
YOU CAN USE THIS OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
ENDLESS THEMES,
COLOR COMBINATIONS.

181
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
THERE IS ONLY ONE PLACE

182
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
SETTING IN THIS DESIGN AND
ONE IN THAT BUT IF YOU SEE

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
A PURPOSE FOR

365
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
ANYMORE AND YOU JUST
WANT TO REPURPOSE IT.

366
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
THE FIRST THING YOU DO

367
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
AFTER YOU PICK YOUR BASKET

368
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
OR YOUR CONTAINER IS TO

369
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
GET SOME GROCERY

370
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
STORE BAGS.

371
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
THOSE JUST REGULAR BROWN
GROCERY STORE BAGS.

372
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN THE
BAG, RIGHT AT THAT SPLIT.

373
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
AND OPEN IT UP SO THAT ITS

374
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
NICE AND FLAT AND THEN CRUSH IT,

375
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
SO THAT ITS NICE AND FIRM.

376
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
AND THAT FIRMNESS IS
GOING TO HELP YOU TO KEEP

377
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
ALL OF THE GIFTS AND FOOD

378
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
STABILIZED INSIDE THE

379
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
BASKET OR CONTAINER
SO NOTHING FALLS.

380
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
ONCE YOU HAVE PAPER

381
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
BAGS INSIDE TO
STABILIZE ANYTHING.

382
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
THE NEXT STEP
IS SHRED ON TOP.

383
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
THAT WILL HIDE GROCERY

384
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
STORE BAGS ON THE
BOTTOM OF THE BASKET.

385
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
THEN ADD THE GOODIES.

386
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
SHIRLEY HAS A TIP TO

387
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
KEEP EVERYTHING UPRIGHT.

388
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
OTHER THAN USING THE PAPER
WHICH IS THE BASE FOR

389
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
MAKING YOUR GIFT BASKET

390
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
KEEP ITEM UPRIGHT IN OTHER

391
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
WAYS, YOU CAN USE SKEWERS,

392
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
YES I'M TALKING

393
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
ABOUT THE BBQ SKEWERS

394
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
WE USE EVERY SUMMER.

395
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
YOU WILL BREAK THE SKEWERS

396
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
INTO THREE INCH PIECES,

397
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
AND THEN ATTACH THE

398
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
SKEWERS ON THE BACK
OF CERTAIN ITEMS.

399
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
YOU JUST ATTACH THE

400
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
SKEWER WITH TAPE.

401
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
USE SCISSORS TO JUST PUNCH

402
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
A WHOLE IN THE PAPER AND

403
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
BRING THE SKEWER DOWN

404
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
INTO THE PAPER UNTIL ALL

405
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
THE ITEMS STAY UPRIGHT.

406
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
THAT'S BECAUSE A HEAVY
ITEM LIKE A BOTTLE OF

407
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
CIDER OR SOMETHING ELSE

408
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
THAT'S HEAVY NEEDS THE
STABILIZATION OF A SKEWER

409
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
BUT THE ITEMS AROUND IT,

410
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
MAYBE CHIPS, MAYBE DIP,

411
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE
LIGHT, AND THAT'S GOING TO

412
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
ACTUALLY JUST SIT ON THE SIDE OF

413
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
THE HEAVY ITEM SO THAT THOSE

414
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
ITEMS STAY UPRIGHT AS WELL.

415
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
FILL THE BASKET WITH GOODIES YOU
KNOW THE RECIPIENT WILL LOVE IS

416
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
THE BEST PART AND THE MOST FUNT

417
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
THINK ABOUT THE PERSON RECEIVING

418
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
THE GIFT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO
AMAZE AND DAZZLE THEM.

419
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
ALSO THINK ABOUT THE

420
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
ENHANCEMENTS THAT YOU ADD.

421
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
AFTER YOU PUT YOUR GIFT
BASKET TOGETHER AND ITS

422
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
LOOKING BOUNTIFUL AND DAZZLING,

423
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
NOW YOU'RE
GOING TO CLOSE IT.

424
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
SO I'M GOING TO NEED THE
TAPE, THE SCISSORS, AND

425
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
THE CELLOPHANE AND THE BOW.

426
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE

427
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
MOST POPULAR ITEM TO CLOSE

428
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
A BASKET AND THAT IS CELLOPHANE.

429
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
CELLOPHANE CAN BE PURCHASED

430
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
AT MANY, MANY CRAFT STORES,
YOU WILL TAKE THE CELLOPHANE,

431
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
UNWRAP IT, AND PLACE IT
UNDERNEATH THE GIFT BASKET AND

432
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
BRING THE CELLOPHANE UP

433
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
IN FRONT AND

434
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
IN BACK OF THE BASKET.

435
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
CLOSE THE CELLOPHANE AND
THEN CLOSE FROM BACK TO

436
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
FRONT AND FRONT TO BACK.

437
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
THAT IS IT FOR CLOSING.

438
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
ON THE SIDE.

439
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
TAPE DOWN THE BACK ENDS OF

440
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
THE CELLOPHANE SO THEY'RE NOT

441
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
IN THE WAY OF THE APPEARANCE,

442
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
THEN USE A TWIST TIE
TO SECURE THE CELLOPHANE

443
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
AT THE TOP.

444
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
ONE, TWO, THREE.

445
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
NOW ITS TIME FOR THE BOW.

446
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
YOU PROBABLY HAVE BOWS IN

447
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
YOUR HOME ALREADY, SO EVEN
THOUGH YOU HAVE THE OPTION

448
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
OF PICKING A BOW OR TWO UP
FROM A CRAFT STORE, FIRST

449
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
JUST LIKE WITH THE BASKET

450
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
AND THE ITEMS YOU'RE GOING

451
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
TO PUT IN THE GIFT BASKET
LOOK AROUND YOUR HOME.

452
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
YOU PUT THE BOW ON, AND PUT

453
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
THE TWIST TIE BECAUSE YOU NEED

454
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
THE TIE FOR YOUR NEXT BASKET.

455
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
NOW YOU CROWN THAT BASKET

456
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL BOW
THAT COMES FROM YOUR HEART

457
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
AND YOUR HOUSE
AT THE SAME TIME.

458
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
AND THAT IS YOUR

459
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
TOTAL GIFT BASKET.

460
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
FROM WHAT WE CALL THE

461
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
BASKET TO THE BOW.

462
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
NOW THERE ARE SOME DOS
AND DON'TS WHEN IT COMES

463
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
TO MAKING A GIFT BASKET.

464
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
ONE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOU DO NOT PLACE CHOCOLATE

465
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
ITEMS AND FRAGRANT CANDLES

466
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
OR FRAGRANT SOAPS TOGETHER.

467
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
YOU WANT THE PERSON WHOSE
RECEIVING THE BASKET TO GET

468
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
EVERYTHING AND TO ENJOY

469
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
EVERYTHING IN THE BASKET.

470
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW OF ANY

471
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
ALLERGIC REACTION TO ANY NUT
ITEMS, AND PASTA ITEMS,

472
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

473
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
ANOTHER THING ABOUT GIFT

474
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
BASKETS THAT IS A DON'T IS
CUTTING YOUR CELLOPHANE

475
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
A LITTLE TOO SHORT.

476
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU'RE

477
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
NOT SURE HOW TALL A PIECE
OF CELLOPHANE SHOULD BE

478
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
OR HOW BIG YOU SHOULD CUT
YOUR CELLOPHANE SOMETIMES

479
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
YOU DON'T HAVE A BIG ENOUGH FAN

480
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
ON THE GIFT BASKET

481
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
AND IT COULD BE STUBBY

482
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
RIGHT AT THE TOP,

483
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
SO MAKE SURE YOUR CUT

484
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
IT AS TALL AS POSSIBLE.

ABOUT WHAT'S CONSIDERED HEALTHY

496
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000

WHEN IT COMES TO STRETCHING
