TRYING SOMEHOW TO MOVE ON

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000

MOVING ON MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE
FOR A VERY LONG TIME IF EVER.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
IT IS NOT CLEAR JUST WHEN THE

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
STUDENTS OF SANDY HOOK WILL

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000

DO, IT WILL BE IN A DIFFERENT
BUILDING, A DIFFERENT SCHOOL, IN

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
A NEIGHBORING TOWN.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT NOW.

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
EVERYTHING.

THAT COMMANDED THE ATTENTION IN

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THE ROOM AND HE WANTED NOTHING

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
MORE THAN TO CATCH UP WITH HIS

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
OLDER BROTHER BEN WHOM HE WOULD

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
SHATTERED.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
IT HAS BEEN A VERY, VERY ROUGH

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
FEW DAYS.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
NOBODY IS GETTING MUCH SLEEP.

81

WE'RE HOLDING TOGETHER AS BEST

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
WE CAN.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
YOU NEVER, EVER THINK THAT

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
TO YOUR FAMILY.

READ AND FIGURE OUT HOW THINGS

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
WORKED.

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
SHE SAID HE WAS EXTREMELY

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
LIVELY, THE LIGHT OF THE ROOM.

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
SHE WILL REMEMBER HIS BIG BLUE

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
EYES, A BOY WITH A BIG HEART,

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000

SISTERS, AND BROTHER AND HIS

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
TWIN MOST OF ALL.

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
WHICH NOAH PASSED AWAY, BUT

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE THERE DURING

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
THE WHOLE EVENT, AND WERE LET

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
SHE JUST TURNED SIX.

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
SHE JUST IS UNDER SIX, AND THEIR

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
OLDER SISTER SOPHIA IS NOT QUITE

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
EIGHT YET AND HOW DO YOU TELL

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
THEM THAT'S HOW THEIR BROTHER

106

DIED?

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
IT IS JUST THE UNTHINKABLE

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
REALLY.

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
>> IN HIS OBITUARY HIS FAMILY

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
SAYS HE WAS IMPISH AND LARGER

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
THAN LIFE AND DEVOID OF
MEANNESS.

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
THEY WROTE EVERYTHING HE DID

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
CONVEYED ACTION AND ENERGY

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
THROUGH LOVE.

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
HE WAS THE LIGHT OF OUR FAMILY.

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
BY HAVING KNOWN YOU, A LITTLE

127
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
MAVERICK THAT DIDN'T ALWAYS WANT

128
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
TO DO HIS SCHOOLWORK OR CLEAN UP

129
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000

FOR HER LOST SON.

141
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
ONE THING THAT WE HAVE BEEN

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
DOING IS TRYING TO KEEP OUR

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
FOCUS ON THE LIVES LOST AND THE

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
LIVES OF THE PEOPLE HERE WHO

ADMINISTRATORS AND WE HAVE

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
AVOIDED FOCUSING ON THE KILLER

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
BECAUSE HE HAS GONE AND FRANKLY

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
WE DON'T WANT HIM TO BE
REMEMBERED, CERTAINLY NOT HIS

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000

155
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000

CHILDREN.

185
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FIRST

186
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
RESPONDERS THAT GOT TO THE SCENE

187
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
ENTERED THAT SCHOOL AND SAVED

188
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
MANY HUMAN LIVES.

189
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I CAN TELL YOU IT BROKE OUR

190
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
HEARTS THAT WE COULDN'T SAVE

191
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THEM ALL.

192
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
>> LAST NIGHT'S MEMORIAL, THE

193
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
FIRST RESPONDERS GOT A STANDING

194
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
OVATION FROM A VERY GRATEFUL

195
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
COMMUNITY.

196
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
[ APPLAUSE ]

197
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
ROB MANNA AND RAY CORBO ARE

198
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
FIREFIGHTERS WITH THE NEWTOWN

HOOK AND LADDER COMPANY AND JOIN

THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

201
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
HOW YOU ARE YOU HOLDING UP.

202
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
>> IT IS DIFFICULT EVERY DAY.

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
EVERY DAY IT IS A LITTLE BETTER,

204
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
BUT IT IS A CHALLENGE, CERTAINLY

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
A CHALLENGE.

206
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS I KNOW

207
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
USUAL DOING IS HANDING OUT GIFTS

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
TO LITTLE KIDS, THINGS FROM THE

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
RED CROSS.
IT HAS TO BRING SOME COMFORT.

210
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
>> DEFINITELY HELPS.

211
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF STUFFED

212
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
ANIMALS AND TEDDY BEARS HAVE

213
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
BEEN STREAMING INTO THE FIRE

214
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
HOUSE AND WE'RE DOING WHAT WE

215
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
CAN TO GET IT OUT TO THE

216
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
CHILDREN IN TOWN.

217
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
>> YOU WERE BORN HERE, RIGHT.

218
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
>> YES.

219
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
>> TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THIS

220
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
COMMUNITY.
I HAVE JUST BEEN STRUCK BY HOW

221
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
CLOSE KNIT IT SEEMS AND PROBABLY

222
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
NOW MORE THAN EVER.

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
>> THE OVERPOURING OF SUPPORT
FROM PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND

224
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
THE UNITY AND THE EMOTION IS

225
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
JUST OVERWHELMING.

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH OF THE

227
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
SUPPORT WE HAVE BEEN GETTING

228
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
FROM EVEN OUTSIDE OTHER

229
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
COMMUNITIES AND ALL AROUND THE

230
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
COUNTRY, THE PHONES RINGING OFF

231
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
THE HOOK FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO

232
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
BRING FOOD OR SUPPLIES OR

233
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
WHATEVER THEY CAN.

234
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
>> I KNOW ON THAT HORRIBLE DAY

235
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
ON FRIDAY YOU GUYS WERE ASSIGNED
TO A TRIAGE AREA.

236
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
IT DIDN'T UNFORTUNATELY END UP

237
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
BEING USED.

238
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN JUST A

239
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
SICKENING FEELING TO BE THERE AT

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
THIS TRIAGE UNIT AND REALIZE

241
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
THERE IS NOT PEOPLE COMING IN.
>> AT THE TIME A FEW TIMES

242
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
DURING THE INCIDENT I ACTUALLY

243
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
THOUGHT TO MYSELF SHOULD I BE

244
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
HOPING THAT THIS AREA WAS FILLED

245
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
WITH INJURED PEOPLE?

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I WAS ALMOST WISHING THAT IT

247
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
WAS -- THE CASE, FAIRLY EARLY ON

248
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
WE REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T GOING

249
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
TO BE THE CASE AND IT WAS
BASICALLY SET UP FOR NOTHING.

250
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
>> HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH

251
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AS A FIRST

252
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
RESPONDER?

253
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
EVERYBODY THINKS ABOUT OBVIOUSLY

254
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
THE CHILDREN AND THE TEACHERS

255
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
AND ALL OF THOSE WHO LOST THEIR

256
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
LIVES AND THE PARENTS, BUT THE
THINGS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE TO

257
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
DEAL WITH, THERE IS -- IT NEVER

258
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
LEAVES YOU.

259
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
>> NO.

260
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
NO.

261
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
>> YOU HAVE A JOB TO DO AT THE

262
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
TIME AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING ABOUT AT THE TIME.

263
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
YOU REALLY DON'T THINK TOO MUCH

264
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
ABOUT THAT KIND OF STUFF UNTIL

265
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
LATER, AND EVEN NOW THERE IS

266
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
STILL A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON
AND I THINK IT WILL GET WORSE

267
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
BEFORE IT GETS BETTER.

268
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
>> YEAH.

269
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT IN THE

270
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS AND WHEN

271
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
THERE IS A LOT OF FOCUS AND

272
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
ATTENTION AND ADRENALINE GETS

273
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
YOU THROUGH, BUT IT IS OFTEN IN

274
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
THE WEEKS AFTER THAT THE PEOPLE

275
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
GO AWAY AND THE REST OF THE

276
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
WORLD KEEPS SPINNING AND RETURNS

277
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
TO SOME SEMBLANCE OF NORMAL,

278
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
THEN IT IS THIS TOWN WHICH WILL

279
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
BE LEFT WITH AN OPEN WOUND.

280
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
>> THERE IS GOING TO BE A NEW

281
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
NORMAL, I THINK.
THE OLD NORMAL A WEEK AGO IS

282
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
GONE, I BELIEVE.

283
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
>> LIVE IN COMPLACENCY ALL THESE

284
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
YEARS AND IT IS GONE.

285
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
WE'LL BE SCARRED FOREVER FROM

286
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
THIS, I THINK.

287
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
>> WE WILL RECOVER OBVIOUSLY.

288
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
LIKE ROB SAID, WE'RE A CLOSE

289
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
KNIT COMMUNITY AND WE'LL RECOVER

290
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
SOMEWHAT, BUT IT IS LIKE ROB
SAID.

291
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
THE SCARS ARE NOT GOING TO GO

292
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
AWAY.

293
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
>> SCARS HEAL BUT REMAIN AND

294
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE.
I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL YOU HAVE

295
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
DONE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

296
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
TALKING.

297
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I WISH YOU THE BEST.
>> THANK YOU.

298
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
>> WITH THE COMMUNITY REALLY

299
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
UNITED IN GRIEF, ONE PIECE OF

300
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
THE PLAN TO MOVE BEYOND THE

301
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
TRAGEDY IS TAKING SHAPE TODAY,

302
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
AND WHEN I SAY MOVE BEYOND, I

303
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE

304
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
PEOPLE WANT TO FORGET BECAUSE

305
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
THEY DON'T.

306
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
THIS TOWN WILL NEVER FORGET AND

307
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
THEY JUST NEED TO TRY TO FIGURE

308
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
OUT A WAY TO CONTINUE ON AND

309
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
HONOR THE MEMORY OF THOSE WHO

310
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
THEY HAVE LOST.
HOW NEWTOWN'S NEIGHBORS ARE

311
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
HELPING SANDY HOOK STUDENTS FEEL

312
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
SAFE WHEN THEY RETURN TO CLASS,

313
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I WILL SPEAK TO THOSE THAT LOST

314
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
LOVED ONES IN PREVIOUS MASS
SHOOTINGS ABOUT THEIR HEALING

315
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
PROCESS.

316
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
ñç@RÑo

317
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
>>> WELL, NEWTOWN SCHOOLS WILL

318
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
REOPEN TOMORROW, BUT NOT SANDY

319
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
HOOK ELEMENTARY, OBVIOUSLY.

320
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
INSTEAD ANOTHER, A FORMER SCHOOL

321
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
WILL REOPEN EVENTUALLY FOR THE

322
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
STUDENTS WHO SURVIVED THE

323
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
SHOOTING.

324
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
THE MOVE WILL ALLOW SANDY HOOK

325
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
STUDENTS TO RETURN TO CLASS

326
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
WITHOUT HAVING TO RETURN TO THE

327
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
SITE OF THE TRAGEDY.

328
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
CONNECTICUT'S GOVERNOR DAN

329
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
MALLOY ANNOUNCED THE MOVE TODAY

330
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
AT A VERY EMOTIONAL NEWS

331
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
CONFERENCE, WHERE HE ALSO

332
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
RECOUNTED THE MOMENTS AFTER THE

333
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
SHOOTING WHEN HE NEEDED TO
DELIVER TO THE PARENTS WHO WERE

334
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
WAITING FOR NEWS ABOUT THEIR

335
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
CHILDREN, WHEN HE NEEDED TO
DELIVER THE WORST POSSIBLE NEWS.

336
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
>> IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT

337
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
THERE WAS A RELUCTANCE TO TELL

338
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
PARENTS AND LOVED ONES THAT THE

339
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
PERSON THAT THEY WERE WAITING

340
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
FOR NOT GOING TO RETURN.

341
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
AND THAT HAD GONE ON FOR A

342
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
PERIOD OF TIME, WELL AFTER THERE

343
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
WAS ANY EXPECTANCY THAT FAMILIES

344
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
WOULD BE REUNITED.

345
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I MADE THE DECISION THAT TO HAVE

346
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
THAT GO ON ANY LONGER WAS WRONG.

347
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
SO I DID IT.

348
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
>> I TALKED TO LYNN McDONNELL.

349
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
KATE BOLDUAN JOINS ME NOW.

350
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I TALKED TO LYNN McDONNELL

351
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
EARLIER.
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THE FULL

352
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
INTERVIEW TOMORROW.

353
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I TALKED TO HER AND HER HUSBAND

354
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
CHRIS ABOUT THAT WAIT.
THEY THOUGHT MAYBE THEIR LITTLE

355
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
GRACE WAS IN SOME PLACE THAT WAS

356
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
SAFE.
AND THEN SLOWLY IT BEGAN TO DAWN

357
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
ON PEOPLE THAT THAT WAS NOT THE
CASE.

358
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
SO WHAT ARE THE PLANS NOW FOR

359
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
SCHOOLS?

360
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
>> IT REALLY STARTED KICKING

361
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
INTO ACTION THE SAME DAY AS THE

362
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
HORROR WAS UNFOLDING.

363
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
NO ONE WANTS TO SEND THE

364
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
CHILDREN BACK TO SANDY HOOK

365
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
ELEMENTARY.

366
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
THEY KNOW THAT IT'S CLEARLY NOT

367
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
TIME FOR THAT.

368
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
IT'S STILL A CRIME SCENE RIGHT

369
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
NOW.

370
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
SO THEY MADE PLANS WITH THE

371
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
NEIGHBORING TOWN FOR A SCHOOL

372
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
JUST SIX MILES AWAY.

373
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
ALMOST -- IT'S VERY FORTUITOUS.

374
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
BUT THERE WAS AN EMPTY MIDDLE

375
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED BECAUSE OF

376
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
DECLINING ENROLLMENT LAST YEAR.

377
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
SO THE NEIGHBORING TOWN MONROE,

378
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE TOWN,

379
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
HE CALLED THEM RIGHT AWAY THAT
SAME DAY AND SAID IF YOU WANT

380
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
IT, IT'S YOURS.

381
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
AND SO THEY'VE BEEN WORKING

382
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
AROUND THE CLOCK.

383
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
CONTRACTORS FROM AROUND THE

384
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
REGION HAVE BEEN DONATING THEIR

385
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
TIME TO GET THIS FACILITY, IT'S

386
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
A FORMER MIDDLE SCHOOL UP TO

387
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
SNUFF AND UP TO CODE.

388
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
THEY HAVE TO CHANGE, REALLY,

389
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
EVERYTHING.

390
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
THE BONES ARE STRONG.

391
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
IT'S A SCHOOL.

392
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
BUT THEY HAVE TO LOWER

393
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
EVERYTHING.

394
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
THEY HAVE TO REPLACE TOILETS TO

395
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
BE SMALL ENOUGH FOR CHILDREN,

396
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN.

397
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
THEY HAVE TO LOWER TOWEL

398
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
DISPENSERS.

399
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
>> DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE KIDS ARE
GOING TO GO BACK?

400
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
>> THAT'S UP TO TOWN OFFICIALS.

401
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
THE MONROE TOWN OFFICIALS TOLD

402
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
ME TODAY THE BUILDING ITSELF

403
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
COULD BE READY AS EARLY AS

404
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
TOMORROW.
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING AROUND THE

405
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
CLOCK TO GET IT READY.

406
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
BUT WHEN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS

407
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
READY TO ASK THE CHILDREN TO

408
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
COME BACK TO SCHOOL, THAT'S UP

409
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
TO NEWTOWN SCHOOL OFFICIALS.

410
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
AND THIS FRIDAY IS SUPPOSED TO

411
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
BE THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL BEFORE

412
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
THE HOLIDAY BREAK.

413
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
SO IT COULD BE, YOU KNOW, ONLY A

414
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
DAY OR TWO THAT THEY'LL BE IN

415
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
CLASS.
BUT SOME ARE SAYING, WE ACTUALLY

416
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
TALKED ABOUT IT WITH SANJAY

417
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
EARLIER, SOME ARE SAYING THAT'S

418
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
REALLY WHAT THE KIDS NEED TO DO.

419
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
THEY NEED TO GET BACK INTO THAT

420
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
ROUTINE.

421
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
BECAUSE ONCE THEY GET INTO THAT

422
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
ROUTINE AND BACK INTO SCHOOL AND

423
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
BACK FOCUSING ON THEIR SCHOOL
AND WORK, THAT'S GOING TO HELP

424
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
THEM HEAL FASTER.

425
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
>> AND OF COURSE THERE ARE GOING

426
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
TO BE A NUMBER OF FUNERALS ALL

427
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
THIS WEEK.
>> YES.

428
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
>> WE SAW TWO TODAY.

429
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I KNOW GRACE McDONNELL, THAT THE

430
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
WAKE IS ON THURSDAY.

431
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I THINK THE FUNERAL IS GOING TO

432
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
BE ON FRIDAY.

433
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
SO WHETHER THE KIDS ARE GOING TO

434
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
GO TO FUNERALS OBVIOUSLY, AND

435
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GOING TO NEED

436
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
TO HAVE COUNSELORS ON SCENE.
THAT FIRST DAY FOR THE KIDS COME

437
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
BACK TO THAT SCHOOL.

438
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
>> SO TOUGH.
AND I'VE BEEN TOLD THEY'RE EVEN

439
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
TALKING TO TEACHERS ABOUT HOW TO

440
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
TALK TO STUDENTS ON THE FIRST
DAY BACK.

441
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
>> SURE.

442
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
>> IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS, IF

443
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
VIOLENCE IS BROUGHT UP OR

444
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
WHATEVER QUESTIONS MAY COME UP.

445
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
YOU KNOW, CHILDREN SEE AND KNOW

446
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
MORE THAN THEY GIVE OFF, YOU

447
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
KNOW.

448
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
THEY'RE VERY PERCEPTIVE,
ESPECIALLY AT THAT AGE.

449
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

450
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
TEACHERS, AND WE SAW IT WHEN WE

451
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
WERE DRIVING AROUND.

452
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
THEY SAID THAT CHALK HILL, THAT

453
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
MIDDLE SCHOOL WHERE THE SANDY

454
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
HOOK CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE

455
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
GOING, IT WILL LIKELY BE THE

456
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
MOST SECURE SCHOOL IN THE STATE.
AND THEY'RE VERY SERIOUS

457
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
ABOUT -- THERE IS POLICE PATROL

458
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
AT EVERY SCHOOL.
THEY SAID UNFORTUNATELY THAT MAY

459
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
NOW BE THE NEW NORMAL AS THEY'RE

460
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO
AND HOW TO PROTECT THEIR KIDS.

461
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
>> KATE, I APPRECIATE THAT

462
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
THANKS FOR ALL THAT LATEST
INFORMATION.

463
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
SADLY, THIS IS NOW THE LATEST

464
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
MASS SHOOTING TO BRING THE

465
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
COUNTRY TOGETHER IN GRIEF.

466
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
AND WHILE MANY AMERICANS ARE

467
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
STILL STRUGGLING TO GRASP THE

468
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
ENORMITY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN

469
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
NEWTOWN, OTHER FAMILIES ALREADY

470
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO FACE THIS

471
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
SORT OF NIGHTMARE.

472
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
WE THOUGHT IT WORTHWHILE TO TALK

473
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

474
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
BEEN THROUGH THIS KIND OF A

475
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
TRAGEDY BEFORE.
AND SADLY, THERE ARE MANY OF

476
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
THEM.

477
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
AMARDEEP KALEKA LOST HIS FATHER

478
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
AT THE SIKH TEMPLE SHOOTING IN

479
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
OAK CREEK, WISCONSIN IN AUGUST.

480
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
WE TALKED TO AMARDEEP A LOT BACK
THEN.

481
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
AND ROXANA GREEN LOST THEY ARE

482
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
DAUGHTER CHRISTINA TAYLOR GREEN

483
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
IN THE SHOOTING IN TUCSON,

484
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
ARIZONA, THAT ALSO INJURED GABBY

485
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
GIFFORDS NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO.

486
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
ROXANNA GREEN IS JOINING ME NOW.

487
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
AND AMARDEEP IS GOING TO BE

488
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
JOINING ME IN JUST A MOMENT.

489
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
ROXANNA, WHEN YOU HEARD THE

490
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
NEWS, WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?

491
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
IT MUST JUST ALL BRING IT BACK.

492
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
>> I WAS DEVASTATED.

493
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I WAS HEARTBROKEN FOR ALL THE

494
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
FAMILIES AND THE VICTIMS.

495
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
IT JUST BROUGHT IT ALL BACK TO

496
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
ME, AND I WAS VERY, VERY SAD.

497
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
>> LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A MIC
BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE HAVING AN

498
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
ISSUE HERE.

499
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
HOLD ON TO IT.

500
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
THERE ARE NOW SO MANY PARENTS

501
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
WHO ARE GOING THROUGH EXACTLY

502
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH.
WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO THEM?

503
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I MEAN, IT'S A JOURNEY THAT

504
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
DOESN'T END, THIS JOURNEY OF

505
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
GRIEF.

506
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
>> WELL, ALL I CAN SAY IS TO DIG

507
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
DEEP WITHIN YOURSELF.

508
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
AND IF YOU'RE A PERSON OF FAITH,

509
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
JUST TO PRAY REALLY HARD AND

510
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
SURROUND YOURSELF WITH LOVED

511
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
ONES OR FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

512
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
AND THINGS WILL GET BETTER IN

513
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
TIME.

514
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S A PAIN

515
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
THAT NEVER GOES AWAY.

516
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I HAVE A HOLE IN MY HEART, AND I
WILL FOREVER.

517
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
BUT I'M JUST PRAYING FOR THEM,

518
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
THEY FIND SOME KIND OF PEACE.

519
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
>> AND I WANT TO BRING IN

520
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
AMARDEEP AS WELL.

521
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
FOR YOU, YOUR LOSS WAS MORE
RECENT.

522
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
OBVIOUSLY, WHEN YOU HEARD OF

523
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
THIS, IT MUST HAVE ALL BROUGHT

524
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
IT BACK.
>> OH MY GOD, IT WAS SHOCKING.

525
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
WHEN WE HEARD IT, WE HAD A

526
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
TODDLER RUNNING AROUND THE

527
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
HOUSE.
AND WE JUST STARED AT HIM.

528
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
MY WIFE LOOKED AT ME.

529
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
SHE WORKS IN THE SCHOOLS.
I WAS A FORMER TEACHER.

530
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
SHE GOES HE WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN

531
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
RAN.

532
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN SHOCK.

533
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
WE STARTED CRYING.
WE COULDN'T STOP.

534
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
>> WHAT IS IT LIKE WHEN THERE IS

535
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
A LOT OF FOCUS IN THE IMMEDIATE

536
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
DAYS AFTER THIS, BUT THEN

537
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
ULTIMATELY REPORTERS GO AWAY,

538
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
AND A LOT OF THE WELL-WISHERS
AND THE COUNSELORS GO AWAY.

539
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
AND THE REST OF THE WORLD SORT

540
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
OF KEEPS SPINNING, BUT YOUR

541
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
WORLD HAS STOPPED?

542
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I MEAN YOUR WORLD HAS COMPLETELY

543
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
CHANGED FOREVER.

544
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
HOW DO YOU COPE WITH THAT TIME

545
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
WHEN THE ADRENALINE FADES AWAY

546
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
AND THE REALITY SETS IN?

547
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
>> WELL, IN MY CASE, I WROTE A

548
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
BOOK WITH JERRY B. JENKINS, "AS

549
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
SHE AS SHE IMAGINED."

550
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I STARTED A FOUNDATION IN MY

551
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
DAUGHTER'S NAME.

552
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
SO I'VE BEEN REALLY, REALLY BUSY
WITH THAT IT TAKES UP A LOT OF

553
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
MY TIME.
AND JUST GIVING BACK TO LESS

554
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
FORTUNATE CHILDREN IN OUR

555
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
COMMUNITY BY BUILDING

556
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
PLAYGROUNDS AND HELPING OUT THE

557
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
SCHOOLS WITH SMARTBOARDS AND
P.E. EQUIPMENT.

558
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
THAT HAS BEEN THERAPEUTIC AND

559
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
HEALING.

560
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
>> AMARDEEP, WHAT CAN COME OUT

561
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
OF THIS?

562
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
WE'VE SEEN FAR TOO MANY OF THESE
KINDS OF THINGS.

563
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I KNOW YOU WANT SOMETHING TO

564
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
CHANGE.

565
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
SOMETHING'S GOT TO CHANGE.

566
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
>> I MEAN, THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE

567
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
HAS TO START.

568
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
ROXANNA AND I WITH MAYORS

569
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
AGAINST ILLEGAL GUNS.
AND WE JUST DID A WHOLE EVENT

570
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
WITH MAYOR BLOOMBERG THIS

571
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
MORNING OR THIS AFTERNOON.

572
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
AND, I MEAN, IT'S NOT JUST THE

573
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
GUNS THAT IS THE PROBLEM,

574
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
THOUGH.

575
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
AND IT'S BECOME LIKE A DEEP DOWN

576
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
ROOTED SOCIETAL ISSUE.

577
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
AND WE NEED TO KEEP THAT

578
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
CONVERSATION GOING.
AND FOR US, WE STARTED A

579
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
DOCUMENTARY CALLED "NURSERY
CRIMES."

580
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
AND WE'RE GOING OUT OF OUR WAY

581
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
TO GO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS

582
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
HAPPENING AT A YOUNGER AND

583
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
YOUNGER AGE, AND HOW WE CAN FIND

584
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALMOST AT

585
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
THIS POINT OF SOCIOPATHY AND

586
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
THEN STOP IT AND BRING THEM

587
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
BACK.

588
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
>> THERE IS ALSO OBVIOUSLY

589
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH THAT

590
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.
IS THAT A CONCERN OF YOURS AS

591
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
WELL?

592
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY.
OUR SYSTEM HAS FAILED SO MANY

593
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
YOUNG PEOPLE.

594
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK CONGRESS

595
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS TO WORK

596
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
REALLY, REALLY HARD TO COME UP

597
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
WITH A, YOU KNOW, GUN VIOLENCE

598
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
PROTECTION PLAN AND A BETTER

599
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO THESE KIND
OF SENSELESS TRAGEDIES DON'T

600
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
HAPPEN.

601
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
>> IT SEEMS LIKE SO MANY EVEN

602
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
PARENTS WHO KNOW THEIR CHILDREN

603
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
HAVE AN ISSUE, OR KNOW THEIR

604
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
YOUNG KIDS IN THEIR 20s HAVE AN

605
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
ISSUE, THEY CAN'T GET HELP

606
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
UNLESS THAT CHILD IS PROVEN TO
BE VIOLENT OR A THREAT TO

607
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
THEMSELVES OR TO OTHERS.

608
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
>> I MEAN, IT'S SAD.

609
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
MOST OF THE TIME THE CHILD

610
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
ACTUALLY HAS TO COMMIT A CRIME

611
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
BEFORE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE

612
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
TO GET HELP.

613
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
AND A LOT OF TIMES MEDICAL

614
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY THAT HEY, I

615
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
CAN'T HELP THEM UNTIL THEY DO

616
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
SOMETHING X, Y, Z BAD.

617
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
AND THAT'S A BROKEN SYSTEM.

618
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
BECAUSE WE CAN SEE YOUNGER AND

619
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
YOUNGER KIDS DOING SMALL THINGS

620
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
THAT WOULD BE SOCIOPATHIC OR

621
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
ISOLATED.

622
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
AND WE CAN GET THEM TO CONVERT

623
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
OR REVERT.

624
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
>> WHAT HAS BEEN IT BEEN LIKE
FOR YOU JUST TO WALK AROUND THIS

625
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
TOWN AND TO SEE -- TO SEE THE

626
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
OUTPOURING OF -- PEOPLE JUST

627
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
WANT TO BE HERE AND HUG ONE

628
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
ANOTHER?

629
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
>> I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY

630
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
SPECIAL.

631
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
IT'S SO HEARTBREAKING WHAT

632
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
HAPPENED HERE.

633
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
IT'S JUST DEVASTATING.

634
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
BUT TO SEE ALL THE PEOPLE COME

635
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
TOGETHER, WE JUST KNOW THAT

636
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
THERE HAS TO BE CHANGE AND HOPE

637
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
WITH THAT.

638
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
>> I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU

639
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
TALKING.

640
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
YOU WANTED TO BE HERE, TOO.

641
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
YOU WERE WALKING AROUND TO SEE

642
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
THE MEMORIALS.

643
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE ALL THE

644
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
SUPPORT IN THE COMMUNITY TO COME

645
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
OUT.

646
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
AND IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE

647
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
THINGS THAT'S -- IT'S ONE THING

648
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
WHEN YOU LOOK AT A KID THAT
FALLS VICTIM TO THIS.

649
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
THEY CAN'T VOTE.

650
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
THEY CAN'T SIGN A PETITION.

651
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
THEY CAN'T GO OUT AND RALLY.

652
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
BUT IT'S US, THE ADULTS AT THIS

653
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
POINT IN TIME.

654
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I MEAN, WE JUST SAW 20 INNOCENT

655
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
LIVES TAKEN WITH NO POINT TO IT.

656
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
IT WAS PERVERTED BEYOND BELIEF.

657
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
AND IT'S UP TO US TO PROTECT

658
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
THOSE CHILDREN AND THE CHILDREN

659
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
THAT ARE UP TO COME, YOU KNOW.

660
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
>> AMARDEEP, I APPRECIATE YOU

661
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
BEING HERE.

662
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
THANK YOU.

663
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
ROXANNA, THANK YOU.

664
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
>> THE LATEST ON THE

665
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
INVESTIGATION AS THE AUTHORITIES

666
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
LOOK AT THE KILLER'S COMPUTER.

667
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI JOINS US WITH
THAT NEXT.

668
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
>>> AS THE NEWTOWN COMMUNITY

669
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE TO MAKE

670
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
SENSE OF THIS TRAGEDY, IF THAT'S

671
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
AT ALL POSSIBLE, POLICE ARE

672
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
TRYING TO PUT THE PIECES

673
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT JUST

674
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
WHAT HAPPENED.

675
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI IS HERE WITH THE

676
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
LATEST.

677
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
WHAT ARE WE LEARNING ABOUT THE

678
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
INVESTIGATION AT THIS POINT?

679
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
>> WELL, THE NEWEST PART ABOUT

680
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
THE INVESTIGATION, ANDERSON, IS

681
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
THAT IT TURNS OUT THE SUSPECTED

682
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
SHOOTER IN THIS CASE DID GO TO

683
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
GUN RANGES A NUMBER OF TIMES

684
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND

685
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
AS RECENTLY AS SIX MONTHS AGO.

686
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
NOW, HE MIGHT HAVE GONE MORE

687
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
RECENTLY THAN THAT, BUT THEY'RE
NOT THROUGH LOOKING AT ALL THE

688
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
GUN RANGES AND CONTACTING ALL OF

689
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
THEM TO FIND OUT ALL THE

690
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
INFORMATION.

691
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
>> DID HE GO ALONE?

692
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
>> WELL, THEY DID FIND EVIDENCE
THAT HE WENT AT LEAST ONCE WITH

693
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
HIS MOTHER.
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PROVE

694
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY WENT

695
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
TARGET SHOOTING TOGETHER AT THAT
GUN RANGE.

696
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
BUT THEY DID BOTH GO TOGETHER AT

697
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
LEAST ONCE.
>> AND HAVE THEY FOUND

698
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
INFORMATION AT HOME, ON
COMPUTERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT

699
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
THAT WE KNOW?

700
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
>> YEAH, THEY'VE BEEN EXAMINING

701
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
COMPUTERS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND

702
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
AT THE HOME.

703
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
AND OUR SOURCES TELL US THAT

704
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
THEY WEREN'T IN GOOD ORDER --

705
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
THEY WERE SMASHED TO

706
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
SMITHEREENS.

707
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
AND NOW THEY LITERALLY HAD TO

708
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
PICK UP THE PIECES, TAKE THEM TO
THE CRIME LAB.

709
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
AND NOW THEY'RE GOING THROUGH

710
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
EVERYTHING, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

711
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
WHAT WEBSITES HE VISITED, DID HE

712
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
TALK TO ANYBODY, WAS HE IN ANY

713
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
CHAT ROOMS, LEAVE ANY MESSAGES.

714
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
DID HE PLAY ANY VIDEO GAMES?

715
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT ALL THESE

716
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
THINGS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT.
AGAIN, IT'S ALL PART OF THE BIG

717
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
PICTURE HERE AND LOOKING FOR A

718
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
POSSIBLE MOTIVE.

719
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
>> AND AT THIS POINT, IS IT

720
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
KNOWN WHY THAT SCHOOL, WHY HE
PICKED THAT SCHOOL?

721
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
>> NO, IT ISN'T.

722
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
AND IN FACT, I TALKED WITH A

723
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
YOUNG MAN WHO WENT TO HIGH

724
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
SCHOOL WITH HIM, AND HE WENT

725
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
DOWN TO THE MEMORIAL TODAY

726
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
BECAUSE HE CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT

727
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
HAPPENED AND FEELS SO AWFUL FOR

728
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
THE CHILDREN.

729
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
BUT HE SAID THAT WHEN HE KNEW

730
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
HIM IN HIGH SCHOOL FOR ONE YEAR,

731
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
THEY WERE IN THE TECH CLUB

732
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
TOGETHER.

733
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
THEY LOVED PLAYING COMPUTERS.

734
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
HE LIKED PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.

735
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
AND HE MENTIONED TWO IN

736
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
PARTICULAR.
ONE CALLED "WARCRAFT III".

737
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
>> SURE.
>> ANOTHER ONE CALLED

738
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
"STARCRAFT."

739
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
AND IT INVOLVES SETTING UP AN

740
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
ENEMY CAMP AND YOU KILL THE

741
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
SOLDIERS AND ALL OF THIS.

742
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
HE SAID EVERYONE KNEW HE WAS

743
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
SOCIALLY AWKWARD, AND THAT HE

744
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
HAD SOME ISSUES GOING ON,

745
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
SOMETHING WITH HIS PERSONALITY.

746
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
BUT AS GUYS, THEY NEVER REALLY

747
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
TALKED ABOUT IT.

748
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
>> AND THEY'RE DOING A COMPLETE

749
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
LOOK AT THE WEAPONS THAT HE HAD

750
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
ACCESS TO?

751
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

752
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
AS WE KNOW, HE CAME ARMED TO THE

753
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
HILT, OFFICIALS SAY.

754
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
NOT ONLY DID HE COME WITH THAT

755
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
HIGH CAPACITY MILITARY

756
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
ASSAULT-STYLE WEAPON AND THOSE

757
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
TWO HANDGUNS, BUT HE HAD

758
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
30-ROUND MAGAZINES FOR EACH OF

759
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
THEM, AND SEVERAL OF THEM FOR

760
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
EACH OF THEM, PLUS EXTRA AMMO ON

761
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
TOP OF THAT.

762
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
AND THEY'RE TRACING THE COMPLETE

763
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
HISTORY OF HOW OFTEN HE USED

764
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
THOSE GUNS, MAYBE WHERE HE USED

765
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
THE GUNS.

766
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
MAYBE HE USED SOME OF THOSE AT

767
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
THE GUN RANGE.

768
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
BUT WE DON'T KNOW.
>> IS THERE ANY MORE INFORMATION

769
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
ABOUT THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER?

770
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
>> THE SHOOTER'S MOTHER.

771
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
WELL, WE'RE FINDING OUT A LITTLE

772
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
BIT MORE ABOUT HER DIVORCE,

773
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
THROUGH DIVORCE PAPERS, FOR

774
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
EXAMPLE.

775
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
SHE WAS GETTING ALIMONY FROM HER
HUSBAND, ABOUT $290,000 A YEAR,

776
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
$24,000 A MONTH.

777
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
THE MARRIAGE BROKEN DOWN BECAUSE

778
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
OF IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES.

779
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
AND THAT HE WAS TO BUY A CAR FOR

780
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
HIS SON AND HIS EX-WIFE WAS TO
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MORTGAGE.

781
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
>> IS THAT PRETTY MUCH ALL AT

782
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
THIS POINT?

783
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
>> YEAH.

784
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I MEAN, THEY'RE STILL LOOKING

785
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
FOR THE MOTIVE AND TRYING TO

786
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
TALK TO FAMILY, TO FRIENDS TO

787
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
TRY TO PAINT A PICTURE OF WHAT

788
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
HE WAS ALL ABOUT.

789
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
THERE IS SOME TALK FROM ONE

790
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
RELATIVE THAT NANCY LANZA --

791
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
WELL, EVERYONE DESCRIBES HER

792
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
MORE AS A GUN COLLECTOR AT THIS

793
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
POINT.

794
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING OTHER

795
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
THAN THAT, ANY PROOF OF ANYTHING

796
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
ELSE RIGHT NOW.

797
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
BUT SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE

798
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
ECONOMY, BUT THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE THAT IT WENT BEYOND

799
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
THAT, YOU KNOW.
>> RIGHT.

800
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
>> WHY SHE WAS COLLECTING THESE

801
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
GUNS.

802
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
>> RIGHT.

803
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, I APPRECIATE

804
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
THAT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

805
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
LATEST ON THAT.

806
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
AFTER EVERY MASS SHOOTING, OF

807
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
COURSE, WE'RE ALL LEFT WITH THE
SAME QUESTION WHY, WHY DID THIS

808
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
HAPPEN.
WHAT LEADS SOMEONE DOWN TO GUN

809
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
DOWN COMPLETE STRANGERS?
DO THESE KILLERS HAVE ANYTHING

810
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
IN COMMON?

811
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
WHAT DOES HISTORY ACTUALLY SHOW

812
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
US?

813
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
BECAUSE WHAT IS FASCINATING IS

814
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
OFTEN WHAT WE THINK WE KNOW

815
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
ABOUT THESE SHOOTINGS, ABOUT THE

816
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
PEOPLE WHO DO THEM, IT'S

817
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
ACTUALLY VERY DIFFERENT THAN

818
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
WHAT THE REALITY IS.

819
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
AND OFTEN IT TAKES YEARS TO

820
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
LEARN THE TRUTH ABOUT THESE
PEOPLE.

821
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR.

822
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
SANJAY GUPTA JOINS ME JUST
AHEAD.
çtoooowl

823
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
>>> IT WAS DEVASTATING TO KNOW

824
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
THAT SOMEONE HAD COME INTO THE
SCHOOL WITH A GUN.

825
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
THAT ALONE WAS HORRIBLE ENOUGH,

826
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
BECAUSE IT'S A PLACE OF PEACE

827
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
AND JOY.

828
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
BUT NOW AS WE GO FORWARD AND

829
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
WE'VE LEARNED THE NAMES, AND NOW

830
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE GRUELING

831
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
PROCESS OF THE FUNERALS, IT'S
VERY, VERY, VERY HARD.

832
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
EVERYONE USES THE WORD HOLLOW.

833
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW.

834
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
>> WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

835
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
FOCUS ON THE VICTIMS OF FRIDAY'S

836
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
SHOOTING.

837
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
WE'RE GOING BRING YOU JUST A

838
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
LITTLE BIT OF MY INTERVIEW WITH

839
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
THE McDONNELL FAMILY, WHOSE
DAUGHTER GRACE WAS KILLED ON

840
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
FRIDAY.

841
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THE WHOLE

842
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
INTERVIEW FOR YOU TOMORROW

843
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
NIGHT.

844
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
BUT WE'LL PLAY JUST A LITTLE BIT

845
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
A LITTLE BIT LATER ON TO HONOR
GRACE, AMAZING GRACE, AS WE

846
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
TALKED ABOUT IN THE INTERVIEW.

847
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
BUT THERE ARE MANY UNANSWERED

848
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
QUESTIONS THAT INVOLVES THIS

849
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
KILLER.

850
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
WHY TARGET AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?
WHY THIS SCHOOL?

851
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
WHY DID HE MURDER 20 FIRST

852
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
GRADERS, LITTLE KIDS JUST 6 AND

853
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
7 YEARS OLD, YOUNG ENOUGH TO

854
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS AND THE

855
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
TOOTH FAIRY.

856
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
AS WE SAID EARLIER TODAY,

857
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
AUTHORITIES ARE EXAMINING A

858
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
COMPUTER SMASHED IN THE GUNMAN'S
HOME.

859
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI SPOKE ABOUT

860
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
THAT.
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT CONTAIN SOME

861
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
CLUES.

862
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
INVESTIGATORS MAY NEVER FIGURE

863
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

864
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
SADLY, THOUGH, THERE IS A BODY

865
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
OF RESEARCH ON THESE KIND OF

866
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
KILLERS, ON MASS MURDERERS, AND

867
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
THE COMMON GROUND THEY MAY

868
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
SHARE.

869
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
DR. SANJAY GUPTA JOINS ME.

870
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
HE HAS BEEN LOOKING INTO THAT.

871
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
YOU'VE BEEN RESEARCHING

872
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
COMMONALITIES.

873
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
WHAT ARE THEY?

874
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND?

875
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
>> ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT

876
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
THESE MEDICAL INVESTIGATORS,

877
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
FORENSIC INVESTIGATORS WILL DO
IS TRY AND FIGURE OUT DO THEY

878
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
FIT A PARTICULAR TYPE.

879
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
AND THEY ALMOST ALWAYS DO, WHICH
IS INTERESTING.

880
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
THERE ARE TYPICALLY THREE TYPES

881
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

882
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY HAS

883
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
PSYCHOTIC TENDENCIES, SOMEONE

884
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
WHO HAS PSYCHOPATHIC TENDENCIES,

885
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
OR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN HEAVILY

886
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
TRAUMATIZED IN YOUTH.
JARED LOUGHNER, FOR EXAMPLE,

887
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
SOMEBODY WE REPORTED ON QUITE A

888
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
BIT.
HE CLEARLY HAD PSYCHOTIC

889
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
TENDENCIES.

890
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
AND ONE OF THE COLUMBINE KILLERS

891
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
HAD CLEAR CLUES DATING BACK OF

892
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
PSYCHOPATHIC TENDENCIES.

893
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
HE HAD SADISTIC BEHAVIOR.

894
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
HE HAD BEEN DELINQUENT WITH HIS
PARENTS QUITE A BIT.

895
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER

896
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
THIS, ANDERSON, BUT HE WAS

897
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
LAUGHING AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS

898
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
ACTUALLY COMMITTING THESE
MURDERS AT COLUMBINE HIGH

899
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
SCHOOL.

900
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
THE POINT IS THAT HARDLY ANYONE

901
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
EVER REALLY JUST SNAPS.

902
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT

903
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
IN THESE SITUATIONS.
BUT THE REAL POINT HERE IS THAT

904
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
WERE THERE SOME CLUES?

905
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
AND THERE ALMOST ALWAYS IS.

906
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
>> THAT NOTION OF JUST SNAPPING,

907
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
THAT DOESN'T REALLY TURN OUT TO

908
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
BE THE CASE, THAT USUALLY THERE
ARE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY --

909
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
SOMETIMES I'VE HEARD -- THERE
WAS A SECRET SERVICE REPORT DONE

910
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
THAT THEY ACTUALLY TALKED TO

911
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
OTHER KIDS, OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT

912
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO.
>> AND IF THEY DO THAT, A VERY

913
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
IMPORTANT POINT, IF THEY

914
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
ACTUALLY TALK TO SOMEONE AS
OPPOSED TO BEING ISOLATED, IT IS

915
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
A GREAT INHIBITOR OF CARRYING

916
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
OUT THE ACTIVITY.

917
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
ONCE YOU START TO TALK TO OTHER

918
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
PEOPLE, EITHER BECAUSE THEY TALK

919
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
YOU OUT OF IT, OR YOU YOURSELF

920
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
GET SOME GREATER CONTEXT OF WHAT

921
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
IT IS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, IT

922
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
ALMOST ALWAYS INHIBITS THE

923
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
ACTIVITY.
SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH A

924
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
LOVED ONE AND OTHER PEOPLE IN

925
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
THE SCHOOL.
COLUMBINE WAS UNUSUAL THAT WAY

926
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
BECAUSE THERE WAS TWO PEOPLE

927
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
TOGETHER.
BUT ALMOST ALWAYS IT IS A SINGLE

928
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
PERSON WHO HAS NOT DISCUSSED

929
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
THIS PLAN WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

930
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
>> YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE

931
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

932
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
ARE A LOT OF THEM ON MEDICATION,

933
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
OFF MEDICATION?

934
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
>> THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING.

935
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
ALMOST ALL OF THEM WERE ON SOME

936
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
TYPE OF MEDICATION.

937
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
AND IF YOU DIG A LITTLE BIT

938
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
DEEPER WITH THAT, WHAT YOU FIND

939
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
IS THAT THERE IS A VULNERABLE
PERIOD.

940
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
IT IS WHEN SOMEONE IS STARTING
MEDICATIONS OR WHEN THEY'RE

941
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
GOING OFF.
AND TYPICALLY THEY'RE

942
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
ANTIDEPRESSANTS.
NOT ALL PSYCHOTROPIC

943
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
MEDICATIONS.
AT THAT POINT WHEN THEY'RE

944
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
EITHER GOING ON OR GOING OFF,

945
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
THEY CAN BE A GREAT BENEFIT, BUT

946
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
YOU CAN HAVE INCREASED

947
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
IMPULSIVENESS, DECREASED
JUDGMENT AND LOSS OF TOUCH WITH

948
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
REALITY.

949
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
THOSE ARE THE THREE SYMPTOMS

950
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
THAT THEY DESCRIBED TO ME.

951
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
AND REMEMBER, ANDERSON, THEY

952
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
SHOULD BE MONITORED AT THAT

953
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
TIME.

954
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
BUT IN A MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM

955
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
THE WAY IT IS NOW, THEY GET THE

956
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
PRESCRIPTION, AND HARDLY ANY

957
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
FOLLOW-UP.

958
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
>> DOCTORS HAVE TOLD ME THAT IF

959
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
YOU ARE ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND

960
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
YOU JUST STOP, THAT YOU SHOULD

961
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
NOT JUST STOP.

962
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
YOU REALLY NEED TO BE UNDER
SUPERVISION AND TAPER OFF.

963
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

964
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
>> AND IT SEEMS LIKE SOME OF
THESE PEOPLE DIDN'T.

965
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
>> NO.

966
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
AND YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE

967
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
MONITORING NOTION INVOLVES

968
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
BUILDING TRUST WITH A

969
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
PSYCHIATRIST, BEING ABLE TO CALL

970
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
THAT PERSON, NOT SIMPLY GETTING

971
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
A PRESCRIPTION.

972
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
AND, YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T TO

973
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
INDICT THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

974
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
BUT IT'S BASICALLY SAYING THERE

975
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
IS NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES.

976
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
THEY CAN BARELY SEE THE PEOPLE

977
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
THAT THEY NEED TO SEE.

978
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
THIS IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO

979
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
MONITOR THEM, AGAIN, AT THESE

980
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
VULNERABLE PERIODS, IT'S NOT

981
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
HAPPENING.

982
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I TALKED TO SEVERAL

983
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
PSYCHIATRIST.
THIS IS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING

984
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
FOR THEM.
>> ALSO OVER THE YEARS THERE HAS

985
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE

986
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
RIGHTS OF THE PATIENT,
UNDERSTANDABLY, BECAUSE THERE

987
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
WERE ABUSES BEFORE.
I GUESS I WONDER, HAS IT GONE

988
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
TOO FAR?
I'VE HEARD FROM PARENTS WHO SAY

989
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TROUBLES

990
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
WITH A CHILD OR WITH EVEN AN

991
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
ADULT CHILD, BUT THEY CAN'T DO

992
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
SOMETHING UNLESS THAT PERSON HAS

993
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
COMMITTED A CRIME OR IS PROVEN

994
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
TO BE DANGEROUS.

995
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

996
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
IMMINENT THREAT TO THEMSELVES OR

997
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
TO OTHERS.
WHAT AN UNBELIEVABLE STANDARD.

998
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
THINK ABOUT IT.

999
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
IT'S LIKE SAYING YOU WOULD HAVE

1000
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
TO BE HAVING A HEART ATTACK TO

1001
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
BE TREATED FOR YOUR HEART

1002
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
DISEASE.
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

1003
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING WE

1004
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
THINK OF AS DOCTORS.

1005
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
THE OTHER OPTION IS BASICALLY TO

1006
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
PUT THEM INTO THE CRIMINAL

1007
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

1008
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
AND NOW YOU'RE ASKING PARENTS TO

1009
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
ESSENTIALLY CREATE A POLICE

1010
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
RECORD FOR YOUR CHILD.

1011
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
>> AND FRANKLY, THAT IS THE

1012
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
REALITY THAT IS HAPPENING.

1013
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I MEAN, OUR PRISONS ARE FULL OF

1014
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL ISSUES.

1015
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1016
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
PEOPLE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THIS
NOTION THAT FAMILIES ARE DENYING

1017
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
THE SYMPTOMS, IGNORING THEM.

1018
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
THAT COULD BE HAPPENING, BUT THE
PEOPLE I TALK TO, THAT'S NOT THE

1019
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
CASE.

1020
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
THESE FAMILIES, THEY ANGUISH

1021
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
OVER WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH

1022
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
THEIR CHILDREN.

1023
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD OPTIONS.
EVEN IF THEY GET THE MEDS, THEY

1024
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
ARE TO BE MONITORED, ESPECIALLY

1025
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
WHEN GOING ON AND OFF.

1026
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
AND THEY DON'T GET THAT.

1027
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
THERE ARE SO MANY POTENTIAL

1028
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
BREAKDOWNS IN THE SYSTEM.
THESE ARE FIXABLE PROBLEMS.

1029
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
BUT IT'S NOT WORKING THE WAY IT.

1030
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
>> AND THERE JUST NEEDS TO BE A

1031
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
WILL AND A CONTINUED DISCUSSION.

1032
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
OFTEN WE DISCUSS THESE THINGS IN

1033
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
THE MEDIA IN THE WAKE OF

1034
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND STOP,

1035
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
AND NOTHING EVER CHANGES.

1036
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
SANJAY, I APPRECIATE THE REPORT.

1037
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT MASS

1038
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
SHOOTERS ARE LONERS THAT SNAP

1039
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
AND GO ON KILLING SPREES.

1040
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
IN HER BOOK "RAMPAGE: THE SOCIAL
ROOTS OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS,"

1041
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
KATHERINE NEWMAN SAYS IT'S NOT

1042
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
THAT SIMPLE, NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

1043
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
SHE HAS DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH
ON SCHOOL SHOOTINGS.

1044
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING BACK ON

1045
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
THE PROGRAM.

1046
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
YOU'VE STUDIED RAMPAGE SHOOTINGS

1047
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
LIKE THE ONE DATING BACK TO THE

1048
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
1970s.
YOU SAY THERE ARE A LOT OF MYTHS

1049
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
ABOUT THEM.
TALK TO ME ABOUT SOME OF THE

1050
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
MYTHS.

1051
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
>> ONE OF THE MYTHS IS THE IDEA

1052
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
THAT PEOPLE SNAP.

1053
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
BUT WE FOUND THAT SOMETIMES THEY

1054
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
PLAN THESE THINGS AS MUCH AS

1055
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
NINE MONTHS IN ADVANCE.

1056
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
ANOTHER MYTH IS THAT THEY ARE

1057
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
LONERS.

1058
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
THEY'RE VERY RARELY LONERS, BUT

1059
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT OF
TROUBLE IN THEIR SOCIAL

1060
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
INTERACTIONS, THERE IS FRICTION

1061
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
ALL AROUND THEM.
I HAVE TO SAY CONTRARY TO WHAT

1062
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT, IN

1063
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
THE CASE OF THE SHOOTERS WE

1064
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
LOOKED AT, THEY WERE ALMOST

1065
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
NEVER DIAGNOSED OR UNDER
TREATMENT.

1066
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
AND SO THEY'RE OFTEN PEOPLE WHO
ARE COMPLETELY MISSED BY THE

1067
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

1068
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
AND WE FIND OUT ABOUT THEIR

1069
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
MENTAL DISORDERS IN FORENSIC

1070
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
SETTINGS AFTER THE FACT.

1071
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
WE ALSO DISCOVER THAT THEY TELL

1072
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
PEOPLE A LOT ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE

1073
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
PLANNING TO DO, BUT THEY DO SO
IN A WAY THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT

1074
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
TO INTERPRET.

1075
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
THEY SAY THINGS THAT ARE RATHER

1076
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
VEILED AND CONFUSING.

1077
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
AND BECAUSE WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO
IS SO OUTLANDISH AND SO

1078
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
INCONCEIVABLE, THE PEOPLE AROUND

1079
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
THEM DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO

1080
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
INTERPRET WHAT THEY'VE HEARD.

1081
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
SO THEY GET A LOT OF INFORMATION

1082
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
CIRCULATING, BUT THAT DOESN'T
COME TO THE ADULTS WHO MIGHT BE

1083
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
ABLE TO INTERVENE BECAUSE THE

1084
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
KIDS HAVE A HARD TIME
INTERPRETING EXACTLY WHAT THOSE

1085
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
VEILED WARNINGS MEAN.
>> I MEAN, WE SEEM TO SEE MOSTLY

1086
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
MALES, YOUNG MALES COMMITTING

1087
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
THESE HORRIBLE CRIMES.
IS THERE -- IS THERE A REASON

1088
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
WHY THAT IS?

1089
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
>> WELL, GIRLS DO OTHER THINGS,

1090
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT ARE

1091
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
DAMAGING TO THEMSELVES.
BUT THEY TEND TO BE TURNING

1092
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
INWARD, WHEREAS BOYS TEND TO BE
EXPLODING OUTWARD.

1093
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
AND THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE

1094
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
IMAGES THAT THEY RECEIVE IN
POPULAR CULTURE, WHICH LIONIZE

1095
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
THIS KIND OF VIOLENCE.

1096
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
OBVIOUSLY NOT AGAINST CHILDREN,

1097
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
BUT THE TRENCH COAT MAFIA, THE
SORT OF GUNMAN IS A FIGURE WE

1098
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
RECOGNIZE.

1099
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
AND FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THESE

1100
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
VERY MARGINAL BOYS, IT LOOKS

1101
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
MORE APPEALING THAN THE DWEEBIE

1102
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
LONER MISFIT.

1103
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
AND SO WHAT THEY'RE SEEKING TO

1104
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
DO MOST OF THE TIME IS SOLVE A

1105
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
PROBLEM.

1106
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
AND THE PROBLEM IS THEY DON'T

1107
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
LIKE THE WAY OTHER PEOPLE

1108
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
PERCEIVE THEM, AND THEY WANT TO

1109
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
CHANGE IT.
AND WHEN THEY START TALKING

1110
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
ABOUT SHOOTING PEOPLE, ALL OF

1111
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
THE SUDDEN THOSE PEER GROUPS

1112
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
START PAYING ATTENTION TO THEM.

1113
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
AND NOW THEY'VE MADE A

1114
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
COMMITMENT OR PROMISE ABOUT WHAT

1115
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
THEY'RE GOING TO DO, AND THEY

1116
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
FIND THEY CAN'T BACK DOWN OUT OF

1117
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
IT OR IT WOULD BE ONE MORE

1118
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
SOCIAL FAILURE.

1119
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
>> THAT'S INTERESTING.

1120
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
SO IN SOME CASES, ACTUALLY

1121
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
TALKING ABOUT IT, HAVING SAID

1122
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
SOMETHING TO OTHERS, IT KIND OF

1123
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
BUILDS UP THE MOMENTUM OR THE

1124
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
PRESSURE FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY

1125
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
ACT OUT ON IT?

1126
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
>> IT DOES, ANDERSON.

1127
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I MEAN, THEY'RE USUALLY QUITE

1128
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
AMBIVALENT ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE

1129
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
GOING TO DO.

1130
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
BUT WHAT PUSHES THEM PAST THE

1131
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
AMBIVALENCE IS THE POSSIBILITY

1132
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE ONE MORE

1133
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
COMPLETE SOCIAL DISASTER IN

1134
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
WHICH THEY'VE MADE PROMISES, AND

1135
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
NOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FULFILL
THEM, AND EVERYBODY IS GOING TO

1136
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
BE LAUGHING AT THEM NOW.

1137
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
AND IT IS AMAZING HOW MUCH THAT

1138
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
MOTIVATES THIS BEHAVIOR.

1139
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT HOW
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL PEOPLE OR

1140
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
DESTROY A TOWN.

1141
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW OTHER

1142
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE THEM

1143
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
DIFFERENTLY.
LOOK AT THE PICTURES OF THE

1144
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
SHOOTER IN THE VIRGINIA TECH

1145
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
CASE.

1146
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
THERE HE WAS WITH GUNS BLAZING

1147
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
AND A FLAK JACKET, AND HE LOOKS

1148
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
LIKE RAMBO.

1149
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
WELL, THAT LOOKS A LOT BETTER TO

1150
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
HIM, I'M SORRY TO SAY, THAN THE

1151
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
DWEEBIE IMAGE OF THE REJECT AND

1152
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
MISFIT.

1153
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
>> AND JUST VERY BRIEFLY,

1154
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT VIDEO

1155
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
GAMES.

1156
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
DOES THAT -- HAVE YOU SEEN ANY

1157
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
LINK?

1158
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
>> THERE IS A LINK, ANDERSON,

1159
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
BUT IT'S NOT THE LINK WE USUALLY

1160
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
THINK OF.

1161
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
OFTEN PEOPLE THINK THAT VIDEO

1162
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
GAMES WILL SOMEHOW INSPIRE

1163
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
PEOPLE TO FEEL RAGE AND GO OUT

1164
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
AND ENACT IT.

1165
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
INSTEAD, WHAT WE SAW WAS THAT

1166
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
VIDEO GAMES JUST LIKE FILMS

1167
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
PRESENT AN IMAGE OF MASCULINITY

1168
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
THAT IS TIED TO VIOLENCE, AND

1169
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
SORT OF GLAMORIZES IT, AND MAKES

1170
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
THESE BOYS WHO DON'T FEEL VERY

1171
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
GLAMOROUS THINK THAT IF THEY CAN

1172
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
JUST DO THAT, OTHER PEOPLE ARE

1173
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
GOING TO TURN AROUND AND LOOK AT
THEM DIFFERENTLY.

1174
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
RATHER THAN INSPIRING A KIND OF

1175
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
BOILING RAGE, WHAT IT DOES IS

1176
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
PRESENT AN IMAGE OF HOW A

1177
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
MASCULINE BOY, YOU KNOW, COULD

1178
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
ACT AND BE NOTICED.

1179
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
>> RIGHT.
INTERESTING.

1180
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
KATHERINE NEWMAN, I APPRECIATE

1181
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
YOU BEING ON.

1182
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
WE'LL TALK TO YOU AGAIN.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1187
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
FOUND THEIR WAY HERE, IN JUST A

1188
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000

SPOKE AT THAT MEMORIAL SERVICE.

PROVIDE, WE WILL PROVIDE IT.

00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
>> Reporter: WHEN DOES TRAINING

1270
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
BEGIN TO BE A COMFORT DOG?
>> 5 1/2 WEEKS.

1271
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
WE BUY PUPPIES AT 5 1/2 WEEKS

1272
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
AND TURN THEM UPSIDE DOWN AND

1273
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
HOW THEIR TEMPERAMENT IS.

1274
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
FROM THAT POINT ON --

1275
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
>> Reporter: YOU TURN THEM

1276
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
UPSIDE DOWN.

1277
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
IF THEY ARE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
AND THEY FLAIL, THEY CAN'T BE A

1278
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
COMFORT DOG?

1279
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
>> RIGHT.

1280
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
OUR INITIAL SCREENING IS IF THEY

1281
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
CAN BE RELAXED IN THAT POSITION,

1282
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
THEN WE START THE NEXT PROCESS,

1283
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
WHICH IS A TRAINER THAT WORKS

1284
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
ONE-ON-ONE FOR THE NEXT EIGHT
MONTHS TO A YEAR.

1285
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
>> Reporter: AND WHERE ELSE HAVE

1286
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
YOUR DOGS BEEN?

1287
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
WHAT OTHER DISASTERS?

1288
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
>> OUR DOGS A MONTH AGO WHEN
SANDY HIT, WE WERE OUT IN NEW

1289
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
YORK AND NEW JERSEY.

1290
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
WE HAVE BEEN IN INDIANA WITH THE

1291
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
FLOODINGS.

1292
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
WE HAD DOGS OUT IN JOPLIN,

1293
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
MISSOURI.

1294
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
>> Reporter: COME HERE!
THIS IS LUTHER.

1295
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
HE IS A COMFORT DOG.

1296
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
YOU CAN PET HIM.

1297
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
IT SAYS RIGHT HERE, "PLEASE PET
ME."

1298
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU SEE A

1299
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
CHILD COME UP TO ONE OF YOUR

1300
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
DOGS WHO HAS BEEN IN THIS

1301
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
SITUATION AND HAS A BIG SMILE ON

1302
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
THEIR FACE?

1303
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
>> TEARS.

1304
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
THEY SMILE, I CRY.

1305
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
>> Reporter: AND AMID THE

1306
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
CONTINUING SADNESS HERE, THERE

1307
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
WERE A LOT OF SMILES.

1308
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
>> NOTHING BETTER THAN SEEING

1309
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
DOG'S TAIL WAGGING LIKE THAT.

1310
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
GARY TUCHMAN JOINS ME NOW.

1311
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
THE DOGS ARE GREAT.

1312
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
WERE YOU ABLE TO TELL THE HOW
THE PARENTS OF SANDY HOOK

1313
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
REACTED TO THEM?

1314
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
>> IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO HEAR

1315
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
WHAT YOU SAID.

1316
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I THINK YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT HOW

1317
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
THIS ALL WORKS.

1318
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
LET ME TELL YOU MY UNSCIENTIFIC

1319
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
FINDINGS OF WHAT I LEARNED
TODAY.

1320
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
KIDS LOVE STUFFED ANIMALS,
ESPECIALLY BIG STUFFED ANIMALS.

1321
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
THESE ARE BASICALLY BIG STUFFED

1322
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
ANIMALS THAT WALK, WAG THEIR

1323
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
TAILS AND LICK.

1324
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
THEY DON'T BITE, THEY DON'T

1325
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
GROWL, AND THEY WANT TO BE

1326
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
PETTED 100% OF THE TIME.

1327
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
IT'S VERY COMFORTING FOR THE

1328
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
CHILDREN.
WHAT WE'RE BASICALLY FINDING IS

1329
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
THIS IS THE EXACT ANTITHESIS OF

1330
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS TOWN ON

1331
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
FRIDAY.

1332
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
>> YEAH, GARY, I APPRECIATE THAT

1333
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
REPORT.

1334
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
BRINGING A SMILE TO A LOT OF

1335
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
PEOPLE'S FACES TODAY.
GARY, THANKS.

1336
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
>>> COMING UP NEXT, THE PARENTS

1337
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
OF GRACE McDONNELL REMEMBER

1338
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
THEIR DAUGHTER, THE AMAZING GIRL

1339
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
THEY CALLED GRACIE.
w?

1340
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
>>> LOOKING AT PICTURES OF A
LIVE VIGIL AT THE MAKESHIFT

1341
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
MEMORIAL THAT IS GROWING WITH

1342
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
EACH PASSING DAY AND NIGHT.

1343
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
EARLIER I MENTIONED I SPOKE WITH

1344
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
THE PARENTS OF 7-YEAR-OLD GRACE
McDONNELL.

1345
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
TODAY THEY INVITED US INTO THEIR

1346
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
HOME.
THEY WANTED TO SPEAK ABOUT THEIR

1347
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
DAUGHTER.
CHRIS AND LYNN McDONNELL HELPED

1348
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
US TO GET TO KNOW GRACE AND THE

1349
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
HAPPINESS SHE BROUGHT THEM AND

1350
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
THEIR SON JACK AND EVERYONE SHE

1351
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
TOUCHED.

1352
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
WE'RE GOING TO BRING YOU THAT

1353
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
FULL INTERVIEW TOMORROW.

1354
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
WE'RE GOING TO SHARE SOME OF

1355
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
WHAT THEY SAID WITH YOU TONIGHT.

1356
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
LYNN McDONNELL TOLD US HOW THEY

1357
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
DON'T WANT TO HAVE HATE IN THEIR

1358
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
HEARTS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
LISTEN TO SOME OF WHAT SHE HAD

1359
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
TO SAY.

1360
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
>> I HAD SAID THAT TO JACK, THAT

1361
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
IT'S OKAY TO BE ANGRY BECAUSE

1362
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
SURE, WE HAVE ANGER AND WE'RE

1363
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
UPSET AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY.

1364
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
BUT I TOLD JACK THAT HE COULD

1365
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
NEVER LIVE WITH HATE.

1366
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
GRACE DIDN'T HAVE AN OUNCE OF

1367
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
HATE IN HER.

1368
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
AND SO WE HAVE TO LIVE THROUGH

1369
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
GRACE AND REALIZE THAT HATE IS

1370
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
NOT HOW OUR FAMILY IS AND

1371
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
CERTAINLY NOT HOW GRACE IS.

1372
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
AND I KNOW ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL

1373
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
LITTLE CHILDREN.

1374
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY HATE IN

1375
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
THEM EITHER.

1376
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
SO WE'LL JUST TAKE THE LEAD FROM

1377
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
THEM AND WE WILL NOT GO DOWN

1378
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
THAT ROAD.

1379
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
BUT WE'LL LET THEM GUIDE US.

1380
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
>> DURING THE INTERVIEW, WE WERE

1381
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
TALKING ABOUT GRACE.
AND I MENTIONED THAT ONE OF MY

1382
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
FAVORITE SONGS IS "AMAZING

1383
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
GRACE," AND THAT IT ALWAYS MAKES

1384
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
ME CRY.

1385
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I SAID I'LL NEVER HEAR THAT SONG

1386
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
AGAIN WITHOUT THINKING OF THEIR

1387
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
GRACE.

1388
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
AND LYNN LIKED THAT IDEA.

1389
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
BUT SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU HEAR THAT SONG, YOU

1390
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
SMILE, THAT YOU DON'T CRY.

1391
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
ANOTHER THING THAT LYNN SAID

1392
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
THAT GIVES HER SOME COMFORT TO

1393
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
THINK THAT GRACE DIED WITH HER

1394
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
FRIENDS, AND THAT THEY WERE
HOLDING HANDS WHEN THEY DIED.

1395
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
SHE LIKES TO THINK OF THEM ALL

1396
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
IN HEAVEN, ALL 20 OF THOSE

1397
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
