WHO THEY WERE, WHAT THEIR LIVES

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
WERE LIKE.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
BEEN VERY PRIVATE ABOUT THEIR

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
LOSS.
BUT SOME REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
KNOW ABOUT THEIR LOVED ONES.

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
THE FAMILY OF JESSE ARECOS --

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
JESSICA REKOS SAID THIS --

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
JESSICA LOVED HORSES, SHE SPENT

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
MOST OF HER TIME DEVOTED TO

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
THEM, WATCHING HORSE MOVIES,

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
DRAWING THEM, READING AND

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
WRITING ABOUT THEM.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THIS CHRISTMAS SHE ASKED SANTA

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
SHE LOVED PLAYING, AS MOST

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
LITTLE KIDS DO.

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
SHE LOVED PLAYING WITH HER

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
LITTLE BROTHER TRAVIS AND HER

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
LITTLE BROTHER SHANE.

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
AS THE FIRST BORN OF THE FAMILY,

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
HER FAMILY SAYS SHE WAS THE

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
ROCK.
AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
LIFE WITHOUT HER.

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
IT'S HARD FOR THEM, ESPECIALLY

99
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
DEVASTATING FOR THAT FAMILY.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
AND IN A STATEMENT THEY SAID,

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
ERIN, WE ARE MOURNING HER LOSS.

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000

HELP HER LITTLE BROTHER TRAVIS

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
UNDERSTAND WHY HE CAN'T PLAY

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
WITH HIS BEST FRIEND ANY MORE.

107
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
JESSICA REKOS WAS JUST SIX YEARS

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
OLD.

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
ERIN?
>> ALL RIGHT.

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
TO VISIT INDIVIDUALLY WITH THE

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
FAMILY AND FIRST RESPONDERS.

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
AND THEN HE WILL BE SPEAKING AT

119
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
A 90-MINUTE VIGIL.

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000

IN PARTICULAR, THE WHY.

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
WE ARE FINDING OUT MORE DETAILS

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
ABOUT HOW THE ALLEGED GUNMAN GOT

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
PUSH FOR MORE INFORMATION IS

135
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
GOING ON.

136
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
AS FAR AS THE ATF GOES, THEY'RE

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
DONE WITH TRACING THE WEAPONS,

138
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
AS FAR AS WHO OWNS THE WEAPONS.

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
FEDERAL AGENTS ARE CHASING THE

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
LEADS, 30 GUN RANGES, 400 GUN

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
DEALERS.

142
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE GUNMAN WAS DOING IN THE

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
DAYS LEADING UP TO THIS

144
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
MASSACRE.
NOW I AM IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000

147
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
NANCY.
WE'RE NOT YET ABLE TO CONFIRM

148
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE CLOSED.

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
WHETHER OR NOT AUTHORITIES HAVE

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
CLOSED THIS AREA AS A CRIME

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
SCENE.
THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY ACTIVITY

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
LOOKING TO COME INTO THE SCHOOL.

WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS SAYING THAT

167
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
BASICALLY THIS GUNMAN BLASTED

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
HIS WAY IN.

169
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
HE, YOU KNOW, HE BASICALLY SHOT

170
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
AN ENTRANCE INTO THE BUILDEN.

171
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
ERIN?
>> ALL RIGHT.

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
ALLISON, AS YOU WERE TALKING, WE

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
SAW THE PRESIDENT GETTING ON TO

WE KNOW HE'S IN PROGRESS AS HE

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
SO HE'S GOING TO BE EN ROUTE TO

NEWTOWN WHERE YOU AND I ARE.

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I UNDERSTAND, ALLISON, THAT YOU

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
SPOKE TO A MAN WHOSE CHILDREN

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000

181
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
TAKE ACTION TO MOBILIZE HIS

183
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000

WHAT DID HE TELL YOU HE'S DOING.

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
>> HIS KIDS WENT TO SANDY HOOK

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
YEARS AGO.

186
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000

THIS.

248
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STOOD OUT

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
TO ME THE MOST WAS AFTER HE

250
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
BLASTED HIS WAY INTO THE SCHOOL.

251
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
HE COULD HAVE GONE LEFT AND HE

252
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
COULD HAVE GONE RIGHT AND HE

253
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
MADE A CHOICE.

254
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
>> HE CHOSE TO GO LEFT.

255
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
TOWARDS THE CLASSROOMS.

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
AND WE WISH WE COULD UNDERSTAND

257
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
WHY.
WE DON'T KNOW.

258
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
>> AND THERE WERE ON THE RIGHT,

259
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
THERE WERE KIDS ALSO,

260
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
CLASSROOMS.
>> YES.

261
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
>> AUDITORIUM.

262
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
THAT WAS THE CHOICE.

263
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
>> THAT WAS THE CHOICE HE MADE,

264
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
TOWARDS THE FIRST GRADERS.

265
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
>> TELL ME ABOUT HOW HE GOT INTO

266
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
THE SCHOOL.
I KNOW THAT WE KNOW HE HAD SHOT

267
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
HIS WAY IN YOU KNOW SOME DETAILS

268
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
ABOUT HOW.

269
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
>> THERE WERE CONFLICTING

270
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
REPORTS.
BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING NOW IS

271
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
THAT HE, HE FIRED HIS WEAPON AND

272
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
MADE A HOLE IN THE GLASS

273
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
BASICALLY AND CLIMBED INTO THE

274
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
SCHOOL.
WAS NOT ALLOWED IN, FORCED HIS

275
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
WAY INTO THE SCHOOL.
>> HE FORCED HIS WAY IN.

276
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
>> TELL ME ABOUT THE FIRST

277
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
CLASSROOM THAT HE REACHED.

278
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
THAT WAS KAITLYN ROIG'S

279
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
CLASSROOM.
WE NOW KNOW ABOUT HER HEROISM.

280
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
>> THE KIDS ARE ALL HIDING,

281
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
WHICH IS SUCH A TRIBUTE TO THESE

282
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
TEACHERS.
FOR SOME REASON HE KEPT GOING

283
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
AND HE WENT TO THE SECOND

284
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
CLASSROOM, WHERE LAUREN WAS.

285
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
LAUREN ROUSSEAU, AND HER 14

286
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
KIDS.

287
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
THAT'S WHERE HE OPENED FIRE.

288
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
>> AND I KNOW SHE TRIED TO SAVE

289
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
THE CHILDREN.

290
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
SHE TRIED TO HIDE THEM.

291
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
AND SOME OF THEM FLED OUT OF

292
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
FEAR AND THAT'S WHEN HE SAW

293
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
THEM.

294
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
>> I BELIEVE THAT'S THE NEXT

295
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
CLASSROOM.

296
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
IT WAS YES, THESE TEACHERS ALL

297
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
WERE, THE EVIDENCE SHOWS JUST

298
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
HEROIC IN TERMS OF TRYING TO

299
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
PROTECT THOSE KIDS.

300
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
>> IN THE SEARCH OF HIS MOTHER'S

301
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
HOME, POLICE HAVE FOUND A LOT OF

302
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
INFORMATION.
WE DON'T YET KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT.

303
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
BUT YOU DO KNOW HOW THEY FOUND

304
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
HIS MOTHER, WHERE THEY FOUND HIS

305
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
MOTHER.

306
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME?

307
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
>> WE KNOW THAT HIS MOTHER WAS

308
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
STIM IN BED.

309
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
SHE HAD BEEN SHOT TWICE IN THE

310
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
HEAD.
THAT POLICE SECURED THE HOUSE.

311
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
BEFORE THAT THEY SEARCHED IT

312
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
WITH A ROBOT OUT OF CONCERN THAT

313
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN BOOBY TRAPS

314
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
OR SOME OTHER DEVICE TO TRAP

315
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
POLICE.
SO THEY USED A ROBOT TO SEARCH

316
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
THE BUILDING AND THE HOUSE, AND

317
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
THAT'S BECOME RELATIVELY COMMON

318
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
PRACTICE FOR POLICE, TO INSURE

319
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
THEIR OWN SAFETY WHEN GOING INTO

320
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
A PLACE AFTER THIS EVENT.

321
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
HAD TWO BEDROOMS WHERE HE LIVED.

322
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
COMPUTERS IN ONE AND A BED IN

323
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
ANOTHER.
A HARD DRIVE HAD BEEN REMOVED

324
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
FROM A COMPUTER AND SMASHED.

325
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
WE BELIEVE THEY FOUND OTHER

326
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
RELEVANT EVIDENCE AS WELL.

327
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
>> WHAT'S YOUR UNDERSTANDING

328
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS

329
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
THE INFORMATION ON THE HARD

330
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
DRIVE.
>> THEY'RE WORKING WITH COMPUTER

331
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
EXPERTS TO RECOVER THE DATA

332
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
THAT'S ON THAT HARD DRIVE.

333
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
>> THERE WAS ANOTHER STORY I

334
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
WANTED TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO

335
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
TALK ABOUT WHEN I READ YOUR

336
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
ARTICLE THAT STOOD OUT.
AND THAT WAS IN THE CLASSROOM

337
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
WHERE ONE OF THE TEACHERS HAD

338
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
TRIED TO PUT THE CHILDREN IN A

339
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
CLOSET AND HAVE THE CHILDREN BE

340
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
AS QUIET AS THEY COULD.

341
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
SOME OF THEM WERE AND SOME OF

342
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
THEM WERE CHILDREN THAT FLED.

343
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
>> TELL ME ABOUT WHAT YOU

344
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
UNDERSTAND ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

345
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
IN THAT ROOM.
>> THE TEACHER TRIED TO PROTECT

346
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
THE KIDS AGAIN.

347
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
AND HAD THEM IN A CLOSET.

348
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
TOLD THEM TO BE QUIET.

349
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
THE SOME OF THE KIDS FLED.

350
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
AND LANZA CAME IN AND HE, HE

351
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
KILLED THE TEACHER.

352
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
HE KILLED THOSE KIDS.

353
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
BUT THE OTHER KIDS STAYED QUIET

354
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
AND THEY STAYED IN THE CLOSET.

355
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
AND AFTER THE POLICE HAD, AFTER

356
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
THIS ENDED AND THE POLICE WERE

357
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
IN THERE, SEARCHING FOR THE

358
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
BUILDING, THROUGHING THROUGH

359
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
THIS HORRIBLE SITUATION.
THEY OPENED THE CLOSET AND THERE

360
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
WERE THE KIDS WHO HAD SURVIVED.

361
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
>> YOU WROTE THAT THEY OPENED

362
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
THE CLOSET AND THERE WERE SEVEN

363
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
PAIRS OF EYES STARING.

364
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
>> YES, MY COLLEAGUES REPORTED

365
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
THE BULK OF THE STORY.

366
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
THEY DID A GREAT JOB.

367
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

368
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE

369
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
TIME TO EXPLAIN IT TO US AND TO

370
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
EVERYONE WATCHING.

371
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
THERE'S SO MUCH HAPPENING HERE

372
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
IN NEWTOWN.
BUT WE WANT TO GO BACK TO OUR

373
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
HEADQUARTERS IN ATLANTA AND TO

374
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
DEB FERRICK, SHE HAS THE NEWS ON

375
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
WHAT WE'RE WATCHING ON THIS

376
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
SUNDAY.

377
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
>>> A DEAL COULD BE CLOSER TO

378
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
AVOID THE SO-CALLED FISCAL

379
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
CLIFF.
A SOURCE TELLS CNN THAT HOUSE

380
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER IS OFFERING

381
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
TO INCLUDE HIGHER TAX RATES ON

382
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
PEOPLE MAKING MORE THAN $1

383
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
MILLION.

384
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
THE WHITE HOUSE IS STILL HOLDING

385
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
TO ITS $250,000 THRESHOLD.

386
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
UNLESS A DEAL IS REACHED BY

387
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
JANUARY 1st, PRACTICALLY

388
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
EVERYONE WILL BE HIT WITH A TAX

389
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
INCREASE.
>>> AND IT APPEARS THAT

390
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TAPPED

KERRY AS HIS NEXT SECRETARY OF

STATE.
A SOURCE SAYS THE PRESIDENT MAY

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT THIS WEEK.

395
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
THE 69-YEAR-OLD SENATOR NARROWLY

396
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
LOST THE PRESIDENCY IN 2004 TO

397
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH.

398
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000

A DECORATED VETERAN OF THE

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
AND EGYPT'S MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
DECLARE AS NARROW VICTORY IN THE

404
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
FIRST ROUND OF HOTLY CONTESTED

405
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUMS.

406
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
THIS SOENL THE FIRST WEEKEND OF

407
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
VOTING NEXT WEEKEND.

410
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
SOME CLAIMS OF VOTER

411
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
INTIMIDATION AND EARLY POLL

412
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
CLOSINGS.

413
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT FROM HERE.

414
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
ERIN, LET'S GO BACK TO YOU IN

415
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
NEWTOWN.

416
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DEB.

417
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
MANY NEWTOWN RESIDENTS ARE

418
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
SEEKING COMFORT IN FAITH.

419
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
AND JOINING ME NOW IS THE

420
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
REVEREND MARK MOORE, HE LEADS A

421
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
SMALL CONGREGATION IN NEWTOWN'S

422
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
TOWN CENTER.

423
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
NORMALLY YOUR CHURCH HAS ABOUT

424
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
20 WORSHIPPERS.

425
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
>> WE'RE A TINY LITTLE PARISH,

426
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
ONE OF TWO PARISHES DIRECTLY IN

427
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
THE VILLAGE OF SANDY HOOK.

428
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
>> WHAT WAS IT LIKE TODAY?

429
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
>> WE HAD A SERVICE YESTERDAY AT

430
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
12:00 TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

431
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
IT WAS PACKED WITH PEOPLE.

432
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
AND EVEN REPORTERS FROM ALL OVER

433
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
THE WORLD WERE THERE.

434
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
AUSTRALIA, RUSSIA, ITALY,

435
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
FRANCE.

436
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
ENGLAND, GERMANY.
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

437
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
FOLLOWING THIS STORY.

438
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
ALL THE MAJOR NETWORKS WERE

439
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
THERE.
YOU KNOW, CNN WAS THERE, OF

440
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
COURSE.
AND SO THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL

441
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
EVENT.

442
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
AND SO THE CHURCHES HAVE A

443
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
PARTICULAR ROLE WHEN SOMETHING

444
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
LIKE THIS HAPPENS.

445
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
THAT IS TO HELP PEOPLE MAKE SOME

446
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
KIND OF SENSE OF IT.

447
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED,

448
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
EVERYONE, INCLUDING ME WAS IN A

449
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
STATE OF COMPLETE SHOCK.

450
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I HEARD, I'M THE SAME AS ANYONE

451
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
ELSE, A SENSE OF SICKENING SENSE

452
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
OF HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY

453
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
HAPPEN.
AND YOU TRY TO WRAP YOUR MIND

454
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
AROUND IT.
AND COMPREHEND THAT YOU CAN'T,

455
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE.

456
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
EVEN THE WAYS THAT WE TYPICALLY

457
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
TRY TO UNDERSTAND EVENTS LIKE

458
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
THIS THROUGH PSYCHOLOGY AND THEY

459
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
SAY THE MAN WAS DISTURBED AND

460
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
THINGS LIKE THAT.

461
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
HE CERTAINLY WAS.

462
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
BUT IN A WAR, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

463
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
THE CULTURAL AND POLITICAL

464
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
TENSIONS LIKE THIS, FOR A

465
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
NATURAL DISASTER THIS GOES WAY

466
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
BEYOND THAT.

467
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
EVEN A VERY SICK MENTALLY ILL

468
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
INDIVIDUAL, COULD NEVER JUST

469
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
BECAUSE OF THAT, COMMIT A CRIME

470
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
SO HORRENDOUS.

471
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
SO YOU'RE THROWN BACK, ON

472
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
RELIGIOUS CONCEPTS, THAT'S THE

473
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
ONLY WAY TO UNDERSTAND IT.

474
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
OUR FAITH TEACHES US THERE ARE

475
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
FORCES OF GOOD AND FORCES OF

476
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
EVIL AT WORK IN A WORLD.

477
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
AND THIS WAS A TIME WHEN THE

478
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
FORCES OF EVIL WERE MANIFEST IN

479
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
A VERY DRAMATIC WAY.

480
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
>> HOW ARE YOU HELPING YOUR

481
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
PARISHIONERS?

482
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
HOW DO YOU COMFORT THEM?

483
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
IT'S ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS

484
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
WHERE YOU WANT TO TELL PEOPLE

485
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

486
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
BUT OF COURSE IT ISN'T GOING TO

487
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
BE ALL RIGHT.

488
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
>> OF COURSE IT ISN'T GOING TO

489
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
BE ALL RIGHT.

490
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
IT'S A DISSERVICE TO SAY

491
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALL

492
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
RIGHT.
I THINK THE ONE THING WE DO IS

493
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
WE DRAW PEOPLE TOGETHER SO

494
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
THERE'S A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND

495
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
CARING.
AND THAT'S THE FIRST STAGE AND

496
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
ANY KIND OF HEALING.

497
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
BECAUSE THERE'S A TREMENDOUS

498
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
AMOUNT OF FEAR AND ANXIETY THAT

499
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
CAN ACCOMPANY THIS.

500
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
SO FACT THAT WE'RE ALL TOGETHER

501
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
IN A LOVING COMMUNITY.

502
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
IS VERY COMFORTING.

503
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
BUT BEYOND THAT, PEOPLE ASK, YOU

504
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
KNOW, TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF

505
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
IT.

506
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
HOW CAN THIS POSSIBLY HAPPEN.

507
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
SO WE TRIED TO AT THE TIME.

508
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
REMIND THEM OF THE TEACHINGS OF

509
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
THE FAITH.
THAT THERE IS GOOD AND EVIL IN

510
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
THE WORLD.

511
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
BUT GOD IS COMPLETELY GOOD, GOD

512
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
OPPOSES EVIL AND IN THE END, GOD

513
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
IS STRONGER THAN THE FORCES OF

514
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
EVIL.
AND THE FORCES OF EVIL WOULD BE

515
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
PURGED FROM THE WORLD.

516
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
AND THAT IS OUR HOPE.

517
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
SO WE LOOK TO GOD FOR HIS, FOR

518
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
GOD'S STRENGTH, HEALING,

519
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
GUIDANCE, KNOWING THAT GOD IS

520
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
ALL-GOOD AND ALL-LOVING.

521
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
AND THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL

522
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
THING.
IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT, THEN IT'S

523
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
JUST SENSELESS MAYHEM.

524
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
AND THERE COULD BE NO HEALING

525
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
FROM THAT.
JUST THE OPPOSITE IS MORE

526
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
ALIENATION AND FEAR AND

527
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
SENSELESSNESS.

528
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IT'S

529
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
VERY HARD TO LIVE WITH THAT KIND

530
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
OF BELIEF.

531
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, REVEREND

532
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
MOORE.
THERE CAN BE GREAT HOLES IN

533
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
MOMENTS LIKE THIS WHEN WE DON'T

534
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
HAVE FAITH.
AS THE REVEREND WAS SAYING,

535
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS
COULD HAPPEN IS A QUESTION FOR

536
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD.
WE WANT TO LOOK AT HOW A PERSON

537
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
COULD CARRY OUT SUCH AN EXTREME

538
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
AND UNTHINKABLE ACT OF VIOLENCE.

539
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
IT'S HARD FOR ANYONE TO FATHOM.

540
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
AS MEMORIALS ARE BEING HELD

541
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
AROUND THE NATION, OUR NEXT

542
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
GUEST WILL HELP US MAKE SENSE

543
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
OUT OF WHAT COULD LEAD A PERSON,

544
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
A HUMAN BEING, TO CARRY OUT SUCH

545
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
AN ACT OF GROSS VIOLENCE AGAINST

546
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
CHILDREN.

547
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
HOW THEY'LL LIVE TOMORROW.

548
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
FOR MORE THAN 116 YEARS,

549
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL HAS WORKED
FOR THEIR CLIENTS' FUTURES.

550
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
HELPING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
RETIRE ON THEIR TERMS.

551
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000

SO IF YOU'RE ONE OF THEM PEOPLE
WHO GETS HEARTBURN

734
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
BLOCK THE ACID WITH PRILOSEC OTC

00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
AND DON'T GET HEARTBURN
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

736
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
[ Male Announcer ]
ONE PILL EACH MORNING.
24 HOURS. ZERO HEARTBURN.

737
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
>>> WE HERE IN NEWTOWN,

738
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
CONNECTICUT.

739
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
A TOWN THAT IS GRIEVING.

740
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
A COUNTRY THAT GRIEVING.

741
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
FOR THE CHILDREN AND THE

742
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
TEACHERS WHO WERE KILLED HERE ON

743
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
FRIDAY MORNING.
THE STREETS HERE, THERE ARE

744
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
MEMORIALS EVERYWHERE.

745
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
YOU GET A SENSE OF HOW SMALL AND

746
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
TIGHT THIS COMMUNITY IS JUST

747
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND

748
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
SINCE IT'S SORT OF LIKE A

749
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
BUCOLIC NEW ENGLAND TOWN THAT

750
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
YOU WOULD IMAGINE, YOU THINK

751
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
THERE'S NO MORE PERFECT A PLACE

752
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
THAN THIS.

753
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
CAN YOU TELL WHAT WOULD HAVE

754
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
BEEN THE PERFECT CHRISTMAS,

755
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
UNTIL THIS HORRIFIC THING

756
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
HAPPENED.
WE DO HAVE SOME NEW DETAILS

757
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
ABOUT SHOOTING AND THE

758
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
INVESTIGATION, I WANT TO SHARE

759
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
THOSE WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

760
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
THE LATEST THAT WE HAVE.

761
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
THERE'S STILL SO MANY QUESTIONS.

762
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
WE THAT CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR,

763
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
DAN MALLOY, 20-YEAR-OLD ADAM

764
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
LANZA SHOT HIS WAY INTO THE

765
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
SCHOOL.
THERE WERE THREE GUNS FOUND NEXT

766
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
TO LANZA'S BODY.

767
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
OFFICIALS SAY ONLY ONE OF THE

768
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
GUNS WAS THE PRIMARY WEAPON AND

769
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
THAT WAS A SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE.

770
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
WE'VE LEARNED THAT THE 20

771
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
CHILDREN KILLED INSIDE THE

772
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
SCHOOL WERE SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES.

773
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE

774
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
CHILDREN WAS SIX OR SEVEN YEARS

775
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
OLD.

776
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
THE PRESIDENT IS COMING HERE

777
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
TONIGHT.
HE'S ON HIS WAY TO NEWTOWN RIGHT

778
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
NOW.
HE LEFT JUST ABOUT 15, 20

779
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
MINUTES AGO.

780
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
THE PRESIDENT WILL MEET WITH

781
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
FAMILIES OF 26 VICTIMS WHO WERE

782
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
KILLED IN THE MASS SHOOTING AT

783
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

784
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
THE SECOND DEADLIEST SHOOTING IN

785
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
AMERICAN HISTORY.

786
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
THE PRESIDENT WILL SPEAK AT AN

787
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
INTERFAITH VIGIL TONIGHT.

788
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
THE VIGIL WILL BEGIN AT 7:00

789
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
P.M. EASTERN.

790
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
WE'LL BRING IT TO YOU LIVE IN

791
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
ITS ENTIRETY.

792
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
>> THE SCHOOL SHOOTING HAS

793
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
RENEWED THE DEBATE ABOUT GUN

794
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
CONTROL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.

795
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
A CONTENTIOUS DEBATE AT ANY

796
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
TIME.
BUT RIGHT NOW, MORE EMOTIONAL

797
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
THAN EVER BEFORE.

798
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING FOR

799
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
TIGHTER GUN LAWS.

800
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
SENATOR DIANE FEINSTEIN SAID

801
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
SHE'S GOING TO PROPOSE AN

802
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN WHEN THE

803
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
NEXT CONGRESS RETURNS.

804
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
HERE SHE IS.

805
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
>> THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS

806
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
TO GET WHAT MAYOR BLOOMBERG

807
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
SAID, WEAPONS OF WAR OFF THE

808
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
STREETS OF OUR CITIES.

809
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
>> OF COURSE THE QUESTION IS,

810
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
WOULD BANNING GUNS STOP PEOPLE

811
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
FROM KILLING PEOPLE.

812
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
THAT'S A CENTRAL QUESTION.

813
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
BRIANNA KEILAR SHOWS US HOW THE

814
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
NEW DEBATE ON GUN PATROL IS

815
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
PUTTING NEW PRESSURE ON BARACK

816
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
OBAMA.
>> Reporter: JUST HOURS AFTER

817
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
THE CONNECTICUT SHOOTING, A

818
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
PROMISE FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA TO

819
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
TACKLE GUN VIOLENCE.

820
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME

821
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
TOGETHER AND TAKE MEANINGFUL

822
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
ACTION TO PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES

823
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
LIKE THIS.

824
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
REGARDLESS OF THE POLITICS.

825
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
>> Reporter: BUT WHAT EXACTLY

826
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
DOES HE MEAN BY MEANINGFUL

827
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
ACTION?
CRITICS OF THE PRESIDENT'S

828
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
RECORD ON THE ISSUE ARE PRESSING

829
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
FOR SPECIFIC PROPOSALS.

830
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
NEW YORK MAYOR, MICHAEL

831
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
BLOOMBERG SAID CALLING FOR

832
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
MEANINGFUL ACTION IS NOT ENOUGH.

833
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
WE NEED IMMEDIATE ACTION.
WE HAVE HEARD ALL THE RHETORIC

834
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
BEFORE.

835
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
WHAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN IS

836
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
LEADERSHIP.

837
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
NOT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, AND

838
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
NOT FROM CONGRESS.

839
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
GUN VIOLENCE HAS NOT BEEN A

840
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
PRIORITY FOR THE OBAMA

841
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
ADMINISTRATION AS HE RAN FOR

842
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
PRESIDENT IN 2008, OBAMA

843
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
SUPPORTED REINSTATING A BAN ON

844
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS.

845
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
>> DON'T TELL ME WE CAN'T UPHOLD

846
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
THE SECOND AMENDMENT WHILE

847
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
KEEPING AK-47s OUT OF THE HANDS

848
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
OF CRIMINALS.

849
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
>> Reporter: ONCE AGAIN BEING HE

850
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
DID NOT MAKE GOOD ON HIS

851
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
CAMPAIGN PLEDGE.

852
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
THE BRADY COMMITTEE TO END GUN

853
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
VIOLENCE GAVE THE PRESIDENT F'S

854
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
ACROSS THE BOARD ON THE REPORT

855
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
CARD.
CONGRESS, EVEN IN THE

856
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
DEMOCRATIC-CONTROLLED SENATE,

857
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
THERE'S BEEN LITTLE APPETITE TO

858
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
TOUCH THE CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE.

859
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
MULTIPLE GUN CONTROL BILLS HAVE

860
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
BEEN INTRODUCED.

861
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
NOT A SINGLE ONE HAS MADE IT TO

862
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE.

863
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
THOSE INVOLVED IN THE DEBATE

864
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
OVER GUNS SAY THE PRESIDENT HAS

865
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
A NUMBER OF OPTIONS.

866
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
REINSTATING SOME FORM OF THE

867
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN THAT EXPIRED

868
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
IN 1994.

869
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
BANNING HIGH-COUNT MAGAZINES, OR

870
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
IMPROVING THE REPORTING OF
PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

871
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE

872
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
DISQUALIFIED FROM PURCHASING

873
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
FIREARMS.
POLLS SHOW AMERICANS HAVE BECOME

874
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
ACCUSTOMED TO DAILY REPORTS OF

875
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
GUN DEATHS.

876
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
FRIDAY MORNING, A SHOOTER KILLED

877
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
A MEMPHIS POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS

878
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
A MOTHER OF FOUR.

879
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
FRIDAY NIGHT, A MAN SHOT AND

880
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
KILLED A WOMAN WORKING AT A LAS

881
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
VEGAS HOTEL, BEFORE KILLING

882
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
HIMSELF.

883
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
EARLY SATURDAY MORNING, IN

884
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, POLICE

885
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
KILLED A GUNMAN INSIDE A

886
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
HOSPITAL WHERE THREE PEOPLE WERE

887
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
HURT.
BUT NEW YORK CONGRESSWOMAN,

888
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
CAROLYN McCARTHY, WHOSE HUSBAND

889
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
DIED AND SON WAS INJURED WHEN A

890
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
SHOOTER OPENED FIRE ON A LONG

891
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
ISLAND TRAIN IN 1993, SAYS THE

892
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
CONNECTICUT SHOOTING MAY BE WHAT

893
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
FORCES PRESIDENT OBAMA AND

894
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
CONGRESS, TO FINALLY ADDRESS THE

895
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
PROBLEM.
>> LET'S FACE IT.
WE NEED TO HAVE THE PRESIDENT AS

896
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
THE BULLY PULPIT.

897
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
ON TRYING TO GET SOMETHING DONE.

898
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
THIS TIME WHAT I SAW WAS

899
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
DIFFERENT, THAT POLITICIANS THAT

900
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
USUALLY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT,

901
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
WERE TALKING ABOUT IT.

902
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
SO THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THIS

903
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
TIME AROUND.

904
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE MAYBE THE

905
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
PENDULUM IS TURNING AND THE

906
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
COUNTRY IS READY TO GET SERIOUS

907
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

908
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
>> WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN JAY

909
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
CARNEY SAID FRIDAY, IT'S THE

910
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
TIME TO EXPRESS SYMPATHY FOR

911
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
VICTIMS' FAMILIES.

912
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
NOT THE TIME TO ENGAGE IN A

913
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
POLICY DEBATE.

914
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
BUT I SPOKE WITH CONGRESSWOMAN

915
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000

24 HOURS. ZERO HEARTBURN.

>>> THE LIVES OF SO MANY

1101
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
FAMILIES IN NEWTOWN HAVE BEEN

1102
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
RIPPED APART.

1103
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
AND WILL NEVER, EVER BE THE SAME

1104
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
AGAIN.
NO ONE CAN EVER THINK OR IMAGINE

1105
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
OF SENDING A CHILD OFF TO SCHOOL

1106
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
WHETHER THEY'RE EXCITED OR

1107
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
CRYING TO LEAVE YOU.

1108
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
NOT SEEING THAT CHILD EVER

1109
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
AGAIN.

AS KEUNG LAW, ONE FAMILY IS

1113
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
PEACE NOW.
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET

1114
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1115

MY WIFE AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND

1116
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
HOW TO PROCESS ALL OF THIS.

SISTER TO A 3-YEAR-OLD AND

1123
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
4-YEAR-OLD.
>> SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON

1124
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
THAT COULD JUST LIGHT UP A ROOM.

1125
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
SHE -- SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING

1126
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
KIND TO SAY ABOUT ANYBODY.

1127
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
AND HER, HER LOVE AND THE

STRENGTH THAT SHE GAVE US AND

1129
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
THE EXAMPLE THAT SHE SHOWED US

1130
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
ARE IS REMARKABLE.

1131
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON.

1132
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
AND I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER

1133
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
DAD.

1134
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000

00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
SOMEONE SO BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT

1136
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
IS NO LONGER GOING TO BE IN OUR

1137
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
LIVES.

1138
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
AND FOR NO REASON.

1139
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
>> BUT THEN, JUST A DAY AFTER

1140
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
LOSING THIS LITTLE GIRL TO

1141
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
VIOLENCE, HER 30-YEAR-OLD FATHER

1142
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
SAID VERY SIMPLY, I AM NOT

1143
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
ANGRY.

1144
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000

1145
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
HAPPENED HERE, WHAT HAPPENED TO

1146
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
SO MANY PEOPLE, LET IT NOT TURN

1147
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
INTO SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US.

1148
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
BUT SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US

1149
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
TO BE BETTER, TO BE MORE

1150
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
COMPASSIONATE, AND MORE HUMBLE

1151
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
PEOPLE.
THE BEST THING THAT I CAN THINK

1152
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
OF TO DO TO MOVE ON IS TO HELP

1153
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
OTHER PEOPLE.

1154
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
WHEN YOU HELP OTHER PEOPLE, YOU

1155
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
FEEL BETTER ABOUT YOURSELF.

1156
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
AND THE MORE PEOPLE HELP OTHER

1157
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
PEOPLE, THEN THE MORE PEOPLE ARE

1158
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
BLESSED.

FROM SALT LAKE JUST EIGHT MONTHS

1160
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
AGO, BECAUSE EMILIEMILIE'S FATHT

1166
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
THEY ARE THEY ARE TRULY STRONG

AND FAITHFUL PEOPLE.

1168
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I THINK THEIR FOCUS ON FAMILY

1169
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY IN

1170
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
THEIR LIFE IS REALLY WHAT IS

1171
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
SUSTAINING THEM AND HELPING THEM

1172
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
BEST PARENT THAT YOU CAN BE.

1175
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
YOU CAN ALWAYS BE BETTER, YOU

1176
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
CAN ALWAYS BE MORE PATIENT, YOU

1177
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000

ACCEPT YOUR CHILDREN FOR WHO

1180
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
THEY ARE.

1181
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I REALLY HOPE THAT AS I CONTINUE

1182
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
TO BE A DAD TO MY TWO CHILDREN

1183
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
THAT I CAN JUST, IF ANYBODY

1184
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
LOOKS BACK ON MY LIFE, THE

1185
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
NUMBER ONE THING THEY CAN SAY

1186
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
ABOUT ME IS THAT I WAS A GREAT

1187
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
DAD.

00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
PSYCHOLOGI

1191
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
PSYCHOLOGIST.

1192
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
DR. JEFF GUARDIER.
WE'RE LISTENING TO ROBBIE

1193
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
PARKER, SAYING THINGS THAT I

1194
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
KNOW FOR MANY PEOPLE WATCHING,

1195
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THE

1196
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
BRAVELY.
WHEN HE SAYS I'M NOT ANGRY, I

1197
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
DON'T WANT THIS TO BE SOMETHING

1198
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
THAT DEFINES ME, I WANT IT TO

1199
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
INSPIRE ME TO BE BETTER.

1200
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FEELING

1201
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
ANGRY, VERY, VERY ANGRY.

1202
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
HOW CAN THEY BEGIN TO GET THEIR

1203
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
ARMS AROUND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO

1204
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
THEIR CHILDREN.

1205
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
>>> I THINK WHAT THEY NEED TO

1206
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
LOOK AT, ERIN IS WHAT ROBBIE

1207
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
PARKER IS DOING RIGHT NOW, HE'S

1208
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
BEING BRAVE, HE'S BEING A ROLE

1209
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
MODEL.

1210
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
HE'S USING WHAT WE SEE IN

1211
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
PSYCHOLOGY AS THE HEALTHIEST WAY

1212
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
TO COPE WITH THE TRAGEDY.

1213
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
HE'S COMMUNICATING ABOUT IT.

1214
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
SECONDLY, HE IS OPENLY GRIEVING

1215
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
AND NOT IN DENIAL AS SOME PEOPLE

1216
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
MIGHT STILL BE.

1217
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
THIRD, HE'S LOOKING AT WHAT IS

1218
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
MOST POSITIVE ABOUT HIS

1219
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
DAUGHTER.

1220
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
THE FACT THAT HE WAS BLESSED,

1221
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
THAT SHE HAD SOME TIME ON THIS

1222
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
EARTH.

1223
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
AND HE IS CELEBRATING THAT AND

1224
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
THAT IS IMPORTANT.

1225
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE FACT

1226
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
THAT HE'S USING SPIRITSPIRITUAL.

1227
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE IN A

1228
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
GOD, BUT THERE IS SPIRITUALITY,

1229
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
A HIGHER POWER THAT WE GIVE THAT

1230
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
PAIN OVER TO, BECAUSE WE CAN'T

1231
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
HAND IT WILL AS INDIVIDUALS AND

1232
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
PSYCHOLOGY MAY NOT HAVE THE

1233
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
ANSWER.
>> DR. GUARDIER, WHAT DOES THE

1234
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
TOWN DO, SUCH A SMALL AND

1235
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
INTIMATE TOWN.

1236
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
AND THIS -- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

1237
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
WAS SUCH, IT WAS A PART OF THE

1238
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
COMMUNITY.
IT'S GOING TO BE THERE, IT'S A

1239
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
CONSTANT SORE AND A HORRIBLE

1240
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
REMINDER FOR PEOPLE.

1241
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
SO, DO YOU GET RID OF THE

1242
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
SCHOOL?
DO YOU NEVER HAVE PEOPLE GO

1243
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
BACK?
DO YOU DEMOLISH IT?

1244
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
HA DO YOU DO?

1245
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
>> I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT

1246
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
THING THAT WE CAN DO, AGAIN FROM

1247
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
WHAT ROBBIE PARKER HAS DONE, THE

1248
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
IDEA OF TAKING THIS TRAGEDY AND

1249
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
COMING OUT OF IT, NOT JUST AS A

1250
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
SURVIVOR, NOT JUST AS A VICTIM,

1251
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
BUT REALLY AS A VICTOR.

1252
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS.

1253
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
AND HOW DO WE MOVE ON?

1254
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
HOW DO WE CELEBRATE LIFE FROM

1255
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
THIS KIND OF AWFUL TRAGEDY.

1256
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
WITH THE SCHOOL AND I TALKED

1257
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
ABOUT THIS EARLIER, NO, WE DON'T

1258
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
TEAR IT DOWN, THEY MAY LOOK AT

1259
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
PERHAPS DOING SOMETHING,

1260
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
CHANGING THOSE CLASSROOMS,

1261
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
MAKING THEM MORE FORTIFIED OR

1262
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
CHANGING THEM FROM CLASSROOMS TO

1263
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
ANOTHER KIND OF A PURPOSE FOR A

1264
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
ROOM, BECAUSE OF THOSE HORRIBLE

1265
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
MEMORIES.
BUT WE HAVE TO BRING CHILDREN

1266
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
BACK TO THE SCHOOL BECAUSE WE

1267
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
DON'T WANT THEM TO DEVELOP A

1268
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
PHOBIA AROUND SCHOOLS, OR AROUND

1269
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
THEIR PARTICULAR SCHOOL.

1270
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
>> I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU,

1271
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1272
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
WE HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE GOING

1273
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
ON WITH THE LATEST THAT THE

1274
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
POLICE KNOW.

1275
