MUFFIN, SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY

1415
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
REALLY ENJOY THE HOLIDAYS AND

1416
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
KIND OF LOOK FORWARD TO, YOU
KNOW, GETTING BACK ON TRACK.

1417
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
PLUS, I KNOW THAT CHRISTMAS

1418
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
EATING KIND OF STARTS LATER IN

1419
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
THE DAY, AND YOU MAYBE WANT TO
START THE MORNING WITH A LITTLE

1420
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
BIT OF A HEALTHY PUNCH.

1421
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
>> YEAH.
>> SO HERE'S WHAT WE DID.

1422
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
WE TOOK TWO CUPS OF OATMEAL.

1423
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
THESE ARE JUST SORT OF
QUICK-COOKING, ROLLED OATS.

1424
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
DIVIDE THEM IN HALF, AND YOU'RE

1425
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
GONNA PULSE ONE CUP IN THE FOOD

1426
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
PROCESSOR TO MAKE KIND OF AN OAT

1427
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
FLOUR CONSISTENCY.
SO WE TOOK THAT.

1428
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
WE TOOK A CUP OF ALL-PURPOSE

1429
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
FLOUR, AND WE TOOK HALF A CUP OF

1430
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
BROWN SUGAR.

1431
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
THAT'S THE ONLY SUGAR GOING IN

1432
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
THIS RECIPE, 'CAUSE THE
SWEETNESS IS ACTUALLY COMING

1433
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
FROM THE APPLES.

1434
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
SO WE WHISK ALL THE INGREDIENTS

1435
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
TOGETHER.

1436
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
A LITTLE PINCH OF

1437
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000

PINK LADY -- ANY KIND OF SWEET

1439

1440
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
PUT IT INTO A SMALL DICE.
AND HERE I HAVE TWO TABLESPOONS

1441
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
OF BUTTER THAT I LET BROWN,

1442
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
WHICH JUST MEANS YOU LET THE

1443
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
MILK SOLIDS CARAMELIZE SO THEY
ADD THAT EVEN NUTTIER, RICHER

1444
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
TASTE TO THE APPLES WHEN YOU PUT

1445
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
THEM IN TO SAUTE.

1446
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
>> SO, YOU LEFT THE SKINS ON

1447
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
BECAUSE OF THE FIBER AND ALSO

1448
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
BECAUSE OF THE COLOR?

1451

IT TO HOLD ITS CONSISTENCY,

1452
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
BECAUSE HERE'S THE DEAL -- WHEN
IT GOES INTO THE MUFFIN, IT'S

1453
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
GOING COOK DOWN, BUT I KIND OF

1454
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
