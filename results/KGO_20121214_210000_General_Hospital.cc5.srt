1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
CLASSROOM 5 YEARS OLD SITTING

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
THERE, JUST BEGINNING THEIR DAY,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
HOPING TO GET THROUGH TO

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
CHRISTMAS, AND IT WOULD

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
CERTAINLY HELP EXPLAIN WHY WE

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
SAW WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
EMOTIONAL MOMENTS FROM OUR

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
PRESIDENT AS HE TRIED TO CONSOLE

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
A NATION.

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
HERE HE IS.

12
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
>> THIS EVENING MICHELLE AND I

13
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
WILL DO WHAT I KNOW EVERY PARENT

14
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
IN AMERICA WILL DO, WHICH IS HUG

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
OUR CHILDREN A LITTLE TIGHTER,

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
AND WE'LL TELL THEM THAT WE LOVE

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
THEM, AND WE'LL REMIND EACH

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
OTHER HOW DEEPLY WE LOVE ONE

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
ANOTHER.

20
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
BUT THERE ARE FAMILIES IN

21
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
CONNECTICUT WHO CANNOT DO THAT

22
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
TONIGHT.

23
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
AND THEY NEED ALL OF US RIGHT

24
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
NOW.
IN THE HARD DAYS TO COME THAT

25
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
COMMUNITY NEEDS US TO BE AT OUR

26
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
BEST AS AMERICANS, AND I WILL DO

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER AS
PRESIDENT TO HELP.

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
BECAUSE WHILE NOTHING CAN FILL

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
THE SPACE OF A LOST CHILD OR

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
LOVED ONE, ALL OF US CAN EXTEND

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A HAND TO THOSE IN NEED, TO

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
REMIND THEM THAT WE ARE THERE

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
FOR THEM, THAT WE ARE PRAYING

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
FOR THEM, THAT THE LOVE THEY

35
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
FELT FOR THOSE THEY LOST ENDURES

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
NOT JUST IN THEIR MEMORIES, BUT

37
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
ALSO IN OURS.

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF THE

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
VICTIMS, AND IN THE WORDS OF

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
SCRIPTURE, HEAL THE BROKEN

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
HEARTED, AND BIND UP THEIR
WOUNDS.

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
>> THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING AT THE

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
WHITE HOUSE JUST A SHORT TIME

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
AGO, ABOUT 45 MINUTES AGO.

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
IT'S NOW JUST A COUPLE OF

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
MINUTES PAST 4:00 EASTERN TIME.

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
WE PLAN TO TAKE YOU THROUGH THE

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
NEXT HOUR HERE ON ABC NEWS.

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
MANY OF YOU WILL THEN JOIN YOUR

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
LOCAL NEWS DURING THIS HORRIFIC,

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
WHAT'S BECOME A NATIONAL TRAGEDY

52
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
IN NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, OF

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
COURSE AT THAT SCHOOL.

54
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

55
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
BEGAN UNFOLDING SHORTLY AFTER

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
9:30 THIS MORNING.

57
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
27 PEOPLE ARE DEAD.

58
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
THE CONNECTICUT POLICE HELPED

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
DESCRIBE THE SCENE INSIDE THE

60
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
SCHOOL.

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
THE SHOOTER IS BELIEVED THE

62
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
SUSPECT'S MOTHER WAS THAT

63
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER, THAT THAT

64
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
WAS ONE OF TWO ROOMS, PRESUMABLY

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
TWO CLASSROOMS THAT HER

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASS WAS ONE OF

67
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
THEM.
SHE DIDN'T SURVIVE IT.

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
NOR DID MANY OF THE STUDENTS

69
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
INSIDE THAT CLASSROOM.

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE HORROR

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
INSIDE THAT CLASSROOM.

72
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
HE WAS DESCRIBED AS WEARING A

73
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
VEST THAT HE HAD WALKED IN WITH

74
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
AT LEAST FOUR WEAPONS.

75
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
THERE WAS ONE MOTHER WHO SAID,

76
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
YOU KNOW, HE WAS MASKED ALTO WE

77
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
WILL NOT KNOW THAT UNTIL, OF

78
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
COURSE, THE HOURS THAT FOLLOW

79
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
HERE WHEN WE GET A SLIGHTLY

80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
BETTER DESCRIPTION.

81
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
THOUGH IT'S ALREADY HORRIFIC

82
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
ENOUGH.
THAT HE SKOOD AT THE DOORWAY AND

83
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF HE ACTUALLY

84
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
ENTERED THE CLASSROOM.

85
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
BUT HERE ARE THE NUMBERS AS THEY

86
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
WERE LAID OUT JUST MOMENTS AGO

87
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
BY CONNECTICUT AUTHORITIES, THAT

88
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
THERE WERE 18 CHILDREN WHO DIED

89
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
AT THE SCENE.

90
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
18 UNFATHOMABLE, TWO CHILDREN

91
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
WERE THEN RUSHED TO AREA

92
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
HOSPITALS.
THEY'D BEEN SHOT, AS WELL, AND

93
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
THEN DIED AT AREA HOSPITALS.

94
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
SO THAT BRINGS YOU TO 20

95
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
CHILDREN WHO WERE KILLED TODAY

96
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
AT THAT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN

97
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
CONNECTICUT.

98
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
SIX ADULTS ALSO KILLED AT THE

99
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
SCENE.
THAT BRINGS YOU TO 26.

100
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
AND WE'VE BEEN HEARING THAT

101
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
NUMBER AT LEAST 27 ALL DAY.

102
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
THAT'S WHERE WE GET TO THE

103
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
ADDITIONAL ADULT AT ANOTHER

104
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
SCENE THERE IN NEWTOWN,

105
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
CONNECTICUT.

106
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
THEY WOULDN'T TELL US WHAT THE

107
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
SCENE IS, OR PERHAPS THE

108
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT

109
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
ADDITIONAL ADULT.

110
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
SO AT LEAST 27 PEOPLE DEAD, AND

111
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
THEN YOU ADD THE GUNMAN, AND

112
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
WHAT'S NOT CLEAR, AUTHORITIES

113
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
MAKING IT CLEAR TO ALL OF US IN

114
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
THAT PRESS CONFERENCE JUST

115
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
MOMENTS AGO, THEY DON'T KNOW

116
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
WHETHER OR NOT AT THIS POINT HE

117
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
TOOK HIS OWN LIFE OR WHETHER

118
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
AUTHORITIES HAD ALREADY ARRIVED

119
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
AT THE SCENE.

120
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
AND AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS

121
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
PARTICULAR SUSPECT YOU HEARD JEN

122
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
ASHTON SAY HERE A MOMENT AGO ON

123
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
THE DESK THAT THIS IS MENTAL

124
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
ILLNESS.
AND THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT

125
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
GUN CONTROL IN THIS COUNTRY BUT

126
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF TALK

127
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS.

128
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
HOW WE REACH OUT TO PEOPLE WHO

129
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
NEED HELP EARLIER, MUCH EARLIER

130
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS CAN

131
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
THEN UNFOLD.

132
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
AND I WANTED TO BRING IN BRAD

133
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
GARRETT, AN FBI PROFILER.

134
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
HE'S AN ABC NEWS ANALYST AND WE

135
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
TURN TO BRAD IN TIMES LIKE THESE

136
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
TO TRY TO WRAP OUR HEADS AROUND

137
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
WHY SOMEONE COULD BE CAPABLE OF

138
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
THIS AND HOW WE WOULDN'T SEE IT

139
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
EARLIER TO TRY TO HELP PREVENT

140
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
IT.
BUT BRAD, YOU KNOW, HOW EARLIER

141
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
IT.
BRETT, HOW DOES A 24-YEAR-OLD

142
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
WALK INTO HIS OWN MOTHER'S

143
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
CLASSROOM, IF THAT IS INDEED THE

144
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
CASE, WITH CHILDREN BEGINNING

145
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THEIR SCHOOL DAY,

146
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
KINDERGARTENERS AND PERFORM SUCH

147
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
A HEINOUS ACT?

148
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
>> WELL, DAVID, THIS IS PROBABLY

149
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
BUILT UP OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS,

150
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I WOULD GUESS.

151
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PROFILE

152
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
OF MASS SHOOTERS, IT'S LIKE

153
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
THEIR LIFE NEVER WENT TOGETHER.

154
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THAT THEY HAD PROBLEMS WHEN THEY

155
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
WERE A CHILD.

156
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
THEY HAD PROBLEMS IN

157
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
RELATIONSHIP, WHETHER THEY BE

158
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
FEMALE, A WIFE, A PARENT.

159
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
AND THESE THINGS TEND TO BUILD.

160
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
NOW, A LOT OF THE TIMES THEY

161
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
CAUSE THE PROBLEM.

162
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
BUT THEY PERCEIVE IT AS IT'S OUR

163
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
FAULT THAT THEY ARE FAILING AT

164
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
THINGS THAT THEY ARE DOING.

165
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
SO AS THEY REACH, UNFORTUNATELY,

166
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THEIR LATE TEENS OR EARLY 20s,

167
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
THERE IS THIS PERIOD WHERE THEY

168
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE TO

169
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
EMPOWER THEMSELVES AND AS ADD AS

170
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
THIS SOUNDS, THEY THINK THEY

171
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO OUT AND

172
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
DESTROY EVERYTHING THEY BELIEVE
HAS WRONGED THEM.

173
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
AND I THINK THE REASON HE WENT

174
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
TO THE SCHOOL, OBVIOUSLY, TO

175
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
SHOOT, PERHAPS, MOM, BUT TO ALL

176
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
OF HER KIDS, IS THAT THOSE KIDS

177
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HER.

178
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
AND I'M GOING TO BET THAT THE

179
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
OTHER SCENE IS A RELATIVE, O

180
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
BROTHER, A FATHER, SOMEBODY ELSE

181
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THAT HE BELIEVED HE NEEDED TO
WIPE OFF THE EARTH BECAUSE THEY

182
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
HAD WRONGED HIM.

183
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
>> CHILLING WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT

184
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
WAY.

185
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
AND YOU'RE THE PROFILER.

186
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
YOU KNOW, I HATE TO TYPECAST,

187
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
BUT YOU LOOK BACK AT THESE

188
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
SHOOTINGS, AURORA, I WAS THERE

189
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
EARLIER THIS YEAR, IN COLORADO,

190
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
FOR THAT.

191
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
VIRGINIA TECH.

192
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
COLUMBINE.
AND YOU SEE THIS PATTERN OF

193
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
YOUNG, WHITE MALES AND PERHAPS

194
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
YOU CAN SHED A LITTLE LIGHT ON

195
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
WHY THAT BUILDS INTO THIS

196
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
PROFILE.

197
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
>> WELL, THE MALE PART I
UNDERSTAND, AND I THINK THE AGE

198
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
RANGE WE JUST TALKED ABOUT, 18

199
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
TO EARLY 20s, SOMETIMES UP TO

200
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
30, SEEMS TO BE WHERE IT FALLS.

201
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
BUT IT -- I ALSO THINK, DAVID,

202
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH

203
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
HOW MALES IN GENERAL DEAL WITH

204
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
STRESS, FAILURE, ANGER, AND

205
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
RAGE.

206
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
WHERE FEMALES TEND TO

207
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
INTERNALIZE IT, MALES

208
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
EXTERNALIZE IT.

209
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
AND IF YOU COMBINE THAT WITH HOW

210
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
MALES TYPICALLY ARE SOCIALIZED

211
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE, THAT IT

212
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
MAKES IT EASIER, I SUPPOSE, FOR

213
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
A MALE TO GO AND COMMIT SUCH A

214
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
HORRENDOUS ACT, AND WE LOOK

215
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
HISTORICALLY ABOUT HOW PEOPLE
KILL EACH OTHER.

216
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
MALES TEND TO DO IT MUCH MORE

217
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
VIOLENT FASHION AND,

218
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
UNFORTUNATELY, IN A MASS FASHION

219
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
LIKE WE HAVE TODAY.

220
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
>> AND THE EXTRAORDINARY THING

221
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
IS, IS THAT THIS PARTICULAR

222
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
FAMILY IS DEALING WITH HORRIFIC

223
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
LOSS, TOO.

224
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
AND WE OFTEN FIND THAT IN THESE

225
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
CASES.
YOU KNOW, THE MOTHER IS DEAD.

226
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHER.

227
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHO THIS SECOND

228
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
ADULT IS AT THIS SECOND SCENE IN

229
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

230
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
BUT AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE, THE

231
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
FAMILIES SAY AFTERWARDS THAT

232
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
THEY, TOO, FEEL AND PRAY FOR THE

233
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
VICTIMS OF THESE TRAGEDIES, BUT

234
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
WHEN WE GO BACK AND LOOK, JEN

235
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
ASHTON, PART OF OUR MEDICAL UNIT

236
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
HERE ON THE DESK, DR. ASHTON,

237
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK, THERE ARE

238
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
OFTEN WARNING SIGNS ALONG THE

239
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
WAY AND NOBODY'S SAYING, WHY

240
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
DIDN'T YOU DO THIS, WHY DIDN'T

241
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
YOU DO THAT?

242
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
WE HAVE TO AS A NATION LOOK FOR

243
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
THESE WARNING SIGNS.

244
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
>> THEY'RE WARNING SIGNS, DAVID,

245
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
THAT ARE ONLY CLEAR IN

246
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
HINDSIGHT, OF COURSE.

247
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
WHEN YOU LOOK, AGAIN, AT THE

248
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
PROFILE OF AN ACUTE PSYCHOTIC

249
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
BREAK, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS

250
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
IS, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MENTAL

251
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
ILLNESS, WE'RE TALKING HERE BY

252
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
DEFINITION OF A SITUATION OR

253
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
STATE KNOWN AS ACUTE PSYCHOSIS

254
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
WHICH MEANS THERE'S AN

255
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
IMPAIRMENT OF REALITY AND

256
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
JUDGMENT.

257
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO

258
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
SUFFER ACUTE PSYCHOSIS,

259
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
TYPICALLY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

260
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE PARANOID

261
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
SCHIZOPHRENIA WHO MAY HAVE AN

262
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
EXTREME OR MANIC FORM OF BIPOLAR

263
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
DISORDER, AND POSSIBLY AS WE

264
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
JUST HEARD, YOU KNOW, A HISTORY

265
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
OF EITHER PSYCHOLOGICAL OR

266
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
PHYSICAL TRAUMA OR ABUSE IN THE

267
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
PAST.

268
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THOSE

269
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
WARNING SIGNS, AS WE'RE GOING TO

270
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
BE TALKING SO MUCH ABOUT, IN THE

271
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
UPCOMING DAYS, HAD BEEN

272
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
APPARENT, AGAIN, MAYBE IN

273
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
HINDSIGHT, YES, BUT LOOKING

274
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
FORWARD, A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN

275
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
HAVE THEIR MOMENTS WHERE THEY

276
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
BEHAVE ERRATICALLY.

277
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU PUT THOSE AS

278
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
A SUM TOTAL AND THEN MAKE A

279
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
WHOLE TIMELINE OF OVER A COURSE

280
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
OF SOMEONE'S LIFE THEN DO YOU

281
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
START TO CONNECT THE PIECES.

282
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
IN TIMES, YES, THERE CAN BE

283
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
GLARING WARNING SIGNS.

284
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
PEOPLE WHO WITHDRAW FROM THEIR

285
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
JOB, WITHDRAW FROM THEIR FAMILY,

286
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
WHO HAVE A HISTORY OF ABUSING

287
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
ANIMALS, WHO HAVE A HISTORY OF

288
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
VIOLENCE OR VIOLENT THOUGHTS, OR

289
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
HEARING VOICES.

290
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
BUT SOMETIMES THOSE THINGS ARE

291
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
NOT APPARENT.
>> SO MANY OF THESE ISSUES CAME

292
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
UP IN THE AURORA, COLORADO,

293
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
SHOOTING.

294
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
THE BATMAN MOVIE, OF COURSE, AND

295
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
WE THEN SAW THE SUSPECT IN COURT

296
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
WITH THE HAIR THAT SORT OF FIRE

297
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
ENGINE RED/ORANGE.

298
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
AND THERE WERE SIGNS IN THAT

299
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
CASE, TOO, AS THAT CONTINUES TO

300
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
UNFOLD.
>> RIGHT.
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S IMPORTANT

301
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHEN

302
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
YOU TALK ABOUT THIS CONDITION OF

303
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
ACUTE PSYCHOSIS THAT A CRIME, A

304
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
HEINOUS ACT LIKE THIS CAN BE

305
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
PREMEDITATED.
AND CAN BE METHODICALLY EXECUTED

306
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
IN SOMEONE WHO IS ACUTELY

307
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
PSYCHOTIC.
THAT'S WHERE THE MENTAL ILLNESS

308
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
COMES IN.

309
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
>> WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT
IN THE DAYS TO COME.

310
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
OF COURSE, THERE'S ALWAYS THAT

311
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
DEBATE ABOUT GIVING A SUSPECT IN

312
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
ANY OF THESE CASES ANY MORE

313
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
ATTENTION THAN THEY DESERVE.
BUT WE OBVIOUSLY DO IT TO TRY TO

314
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

315
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I WANT TO TURN TO YOUR TEAMMATE,

316
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
DR. BESSER WHO'S AT THE SCENE

317
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
NOW.

318
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE TO

319
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
FOCUS ON, TONIGHT, OF COURSE,

320
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
AND THIS AFTERNOON, AND INTO THE

321
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
WEEKEND, ARE THOSE CHILDREN WHO

322
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
WERE SHUTTLED OUT OF THAT SCHOOL

323
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
TODAY AND WHAT TO SAY TO THEM.

324
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
RICH, YOU'RE A DAD, TOO.

325
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
THE QUESTION FOR YOU TONIGHT,

326
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
IS, WHAT WILL YOU SAY TO YOUR

327
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
OWN CHILDREN?

328
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
>> YOU KNOW, THAT'S A TOUGH ONE,

329
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
DAVID.
AND, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE KNOWS

330
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
THEIR OWN CHILD BEST.

331
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
SO YOU REALLY WANT TO DEAL WITH

332
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
THEM BASED ON THEIR AGE, AND

333
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
THEIR OWN PERSONALITY.

334
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
VERY YOUNG CHILDREN, CHILDREN

335
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
WHO ARE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL OR

336
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
YOUNGER, IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO

337
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
SHIELD THEM FROM THIS SO THEY

338
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT, THAT'S

339
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
THE BEST APPROACH.

340
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
IF THEY'RE A LITTLE OLDER THAN

341
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
THAT, IF THEY'RE ELEMENTARY

342
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
SCHOOL UP TO MIDDLE SCHOOL, YOU

343
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO

344
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
YOU ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE FEELING.

345
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO

346
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
THEM IN CLEAR LANGUAGE ABOUT

347
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING.

348
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
BUT OVERALL, YOU WANT TO GIVE

349
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
THEM THAT SENSE THAT THEY ARE

350
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
SAFE, THAT THIS WAS A BAD MAN

351
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
WHO DID THIS, THIS WAS SOMEONE

352
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
WHO WASN'T WELL AND HE'S NOT

353
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
AROUND ANYMORE.

354
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
THE POLICE DID THEIR JOB.

355
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
THAT WILL GIVE THEM THAT FEELING

356
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
OF SECURITY.

357
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
HUGS, PHYSICAL CONTACT, CAN BE

358
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
VERY, VERY IMPORTANT TO

359
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
COMMUNICATING THAT SENSE OF

360
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
WELLBEING.
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT OLDER

361
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
KIDS, I HAVE TEENAGERS, MY KIDS,

362
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

363
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

364
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
HOW COULD IT HAVE BEEN

365
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
PREVENTED?

366
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
WHAT CAN THEY DO IN THEIR LIVES

367
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
RIGHT NOW TO TAKE CHARGE TO MAKE

368
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
SURE THAT THESE THINGS DON'T

369
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
KEEP HAPPENING SO OFTEN?

370
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
AND SO UNDERSTANDING YOUR CHILD,

371
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
LETTING THEM TALK, LETTING THEM

372
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
KNOW THAT YOU'RE FEELING BAD

373
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
ABOUT THIS, THAT YOU'RE FEELING

374
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
SAD, THAT YOU'RE ANGRY, THOSE

375
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
THINGS ARE ALL VERY IMPORTANT TO

376
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
DO DURING THIS PHASE.

377
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
>> RICH, THANKS SO MUCH.

378
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I KNOW YOU'RE THERE ON THE

379
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
SCENE.

380
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TALK

381
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
WITH ANY OF THESE FAMILIES, TO

382
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
HEAR HOW THIS COMMUNITY IS

383
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
DEALING WITH THIS?

384
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
WE KNOW IT INITIALLY, YOU KNOW,

385
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
BEGAN AT THAT 9:30 CALL THAT

386
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
WENT INTO AUTHORITIES AND THEN

387
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
THAT SORT OF -- THAT

388
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
TECHNOLOGICAL SIDE OF THE TIMES

389
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
THAT TEXT ALERT THAT WENT OUT

390
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
SAYING TO PICK UP YOUR CHILDREN

391
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
AT THAT FIREHOUSE, WHICH WAS

392
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM THE

393
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

394
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
AND, YOU KNOW, IN THE BEGINNING,

395
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
WHAT WAS EARLY REPORTED WAS THAT

396
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
PARENTS DIDN'T ACTUALLY KNOW

397
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
WHICH SCHOOL THEY WERE TALKING

398
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
ABOUT.
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE FEAR

399
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
THAT STRIKES IN ANY PARENT.

400
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'M CURIOUS IF YOU'VE BEEN ABLE

401
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
TO TALK TO ANY MEMBERS OF THAT

402
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
COMMUNITY.
THEY'VE BEEN DESCRIBED AS CLOSE

403
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
KNIT AND THEY LIKELY ALL KNOW

404
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
EACH OTHER AND ARE PULLING

405
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
TOGETHER ALREADY.
BUT WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN?

406
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
>> YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T HAD A

407
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
CHANCE TO TALK TO ANYONE YET,

408
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
DAVID.
THE POLICE HAVE BARRICADED OFF

409
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
THAT AREA.

410
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
THERE ARE LONG LINES OF PEOPLE

411
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
TRYING TO GET CLOSE.

412
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF THEM

413
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
ARE FAMILY AND HOW MANY OF THEM

414
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
ARE MEDIA.
BUT THESE ARE THE SORT OF E

415
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
EVENTS THAT DO PULL COMMUNITIES

416
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
CLOSER TOGETHER.

417
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
THIS IS A TIME WHEN YOU NEED TO

418
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
REACH OUT TO YOUR FRIENDS, TO

419
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, TO YOUR

420
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
NEIGHBORS, AND TO THOSE PEOPLE

421
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
WHO MAY BE ALONE AND MAKE SURE

422
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
THAT THEY ARE WELL -- THEY'RE

423
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
BEING WELL CARED FOR AND THAT

424
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
THEY HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS GIVING

425
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
THEM THE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THAT

426
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
YOU ARE GIVING YOUR OWN FAMILY.

427
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
>> AND, RICH, FOR THE STUDENTS

428
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
THERE AT SANDY HOOK, I MEAN,

429
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
THIS IS A K-4 SCHOOL.

430
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
IT'S AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

431
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
WE KNOW TWO OF THE ROOMS

432
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
TARGETED.

433
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
ONE OF THEM WAS A KINDERGARTEN

434
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
CLASS.

435
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
IN CASES THEY JUST SHUT TOWN THE

436
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
SCHOOL FOR A COUPLE WEEKS.

437
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL HAVE

438
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
CLASS NOW THROUGH WHAT WAS GOING

439
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
TO BE THEIR CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY

440
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
AND THEIR NEW YEAR'S HOLIDAY IN

441
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS' TIME.

442
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
MOW DO YOU CONVINCE STUDENTS AT

443
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
THIS SCHOOL, STUDENTS ACROSS THE

444
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
COUNTRY, BUT IN PARTICULAR AT

445
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
THIS SCHOOL THAT WHEN THEY GO

446
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
BACK THAT THEIR CLASSROOM, THAT

447
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
THEIR HALLWAYS ARE SAFE?

448
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
>> YOU KNOW, THAT'S A GREAT

449
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
QUESTION.

450
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
AND I THINK THEY'RE GOING IT
LOOK FOR SOME EXPERT OPINION

451
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
ABOUT WHEN TO LET CHILDREN BACK

452
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
INTO THIS SCHOOL.

453
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
WHEN YOU LOOK AT COUNTRIES THAT

454
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
FACE A LOT OF TERRORISM, ONE OF

455
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
THE THINGS THAT THEY TRY AND DO

456
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
RIGHT AWAY IS TO NORMALIZE THE

457
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
SITUATION.

458
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
AND REMOVE ANY SIGN OF THE EVENT

459
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
THAT TOOK PLACE.

460
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
YOU KNOW, WE HAVEN'T BEEN INSIDE

461
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
THIS SCHOOL.
THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF

462
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT.

463
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
BUT THE MORE THEY CAN DO TO MAKE

464
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
THAT AREA LOOK NORMAL SO THAT

465
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
WHEN KIDS EVENTUALLY GO BACK

466
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
INTO THAT SCHOOL, IT LOOKS LIKE

467
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
THEY REMEMBERED IT AS A SAFE

468
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
PLACE, THAT WILL BE VERY

469
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF HEALING.

470
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
>> RICH BESSER THERE ON SCENE IN

471
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

472
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
DR. RICHARD BESSER.

473
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
WE'LL BE CHECKING IN WITH YOU

474
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
VIEWERS JOINING US, 15 MINUTES

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
PAST 4:00 EASTERN TIME, MY

477
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
FRIEND, COLLEAGUE, DIANE SAWYER

478
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
WILL BE ANCHOR FROM THE SCENE, A

479
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
ONE HOUR EDITION OF "WORLD

NEWS."
SHE'S BEEN ON THE SCENE MUCH OF

481
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
THE DAY AND TALKED WITH PARENTS

482
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
EARLIER WHO DESCRIBED A CHAOTIC

483
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
SCENE WHEN THEY GOT THERE.

484
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
SOME OF THE TEACHERS, VERY

485
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
CALMLY TELLING CHILDREN TO COVER

486
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
THEIR EYES AS THEY WERE WALKING

487
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
OUT.
IN FACT, ONE OF THE IMAGES THAT

488
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
STRUCK ME WAS THE FATHER WHO

489
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
HELD HIS OWN HAND, HIS OWN ARM

490
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
OVER HIS SON'S EYE, DOING THE

491
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
SHIELDING FOR HIM.

492
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
ON YOUR SCREEN, JUST A QUICK

493
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
LOOK AT OUR PROGRAMS.
WE'LL BE COVERING THIS OBVIOUSLY

494
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
THROUGHOUT THE EVENING.
"WORLD NEWS" OF COURSE WITH

495
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
DIANE.

496
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
"2020."

497
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
"NIGHTLINE" TONIGHT.

498
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.

499
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
"GMA" THROUGH THE MORNING.

500
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU THROUGH

501
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
THE AFTERNOON.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU.

502
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE TO

503
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
LEAVE THE TV, ABCNEWS.COM, FIND

504
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS.

505
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I WANT TO BRING YOU UP TO SPEED

506
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
ON WHAT WE'VE LEARNED.

507
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
THE PORTRAIT OF THE SCHOOL IS

508
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
THE CLEAREST WE'VE HAD YET SINCE

509
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
THIS TRAGEDY BEGAN UNFOLDING

510
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
THIS MORNING.

511
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
AS WE LOOK BACK TO IMAGES OF

512
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
THAT SCENE, HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW.

513
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
WE KNOW 18 CHILDREN DIED INSIDE

514
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
THAT SCHOOL.
THERE WERE TWO ROOMS, IT'S

515
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
BELIEVED, THE SUSPECT ACTUALLY

516
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
TARGETED.

517
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
ONE OF THEM WAS A KINDERGARTEN

518
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
CLASS WHERE HIS MOTHER WAS THE

519
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
TEACHER.
TWO OF THE CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN

520
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
SHOT THEY HOPED TO BE ABLE TO

521
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
SAVE.
WE SAW THE IMAGES OF THE

522
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
AMBULANCES GOING TO THE SCHOOL.

523
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
THEY RUSHED THE TWO CHILDREN TO

524
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
AN AREA HOSPITAL AND THEY, TOO,

525
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
DIED AT THE HOSPITAL.

526
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
WE ARE TOLD.
YOU CAN SEE THE ANGUISH ON THESE

527
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
FACES HERE.

528
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
AS WE GO DOWN THE LIST AND THE

529
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
NUMBERS HERE.

530
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
6 ADULTS WERE ALSO KILLED AT THE

531
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
SCENE.
SO IT'S 18 CHILDREN, 6 ADULTS.

532
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
TWO ADDITIONAL CHILDREN AT THE

533
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
LOCAL HOSPITAL.
AND THEN WHAT WE DON'T KNOW, AND

534
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
WE'RE WAITING FOR MORE REPORTING

535
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
FROM OUR JUSTICE TEAM, LED BY

536
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
PIERRE THOMAS, IS THE ADDITIONAL

537
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
SCENE WHERE WE BELIEVE FROM

538

LIEUTENANT PAUL VANCE OF

539
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE THAT

540
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
THERE IS ONE MORE SCENE IN

541
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, WHERE

542
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO

543
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
INVESTIGATE THAT THERE'S AN

544
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
ADDITIONAL ADULT WHO HAS DIED AT

545
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
THAT SCENE, BUT THEY WERE VERY

546
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
RELUCTANT TO OFFER ANY MORE

547
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
DETAILS BECAUSE OF HOW EARLY WE

548
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000

549
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
THIS LITTLE BOY HERE, AND THE

550
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
MOTHER, THE ANGUISH AND ONE OF

551
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
THE THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED

552
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
ABOUT HERE, JEN, IS THAT THE

553
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
CHILDREN, THEMSELVES, WALKING

554
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
SINGLE FILE OUT OF THAT SCHOOL,

555
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
ONE OF THE VERY EARLY REPORTS AS

556
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
WE WERE SITTING HERE ON THE DESK

557
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
WAS FROM SOMEONE ON THE SCENE

558
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
WHO SAID THEY COULD HEAR THE

559
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
CRIES, A LITTLE BIT OF

560
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
WHIMPERING, BUT THERE WAS NO

561
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
SCREAMING.
THE CHILDREN DID EXACTLY WHAT

562
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
THEY WERE TOLD.

563
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
THAT THE REAL EMOTION CAME FROM

564
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
THE ADULTS AND THE TEENAGERS AT

565
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
THE MIDDLE SCHOOL, THE HIGH

566
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
SCHOOL WHO WERE WORRIED ABOUT

567
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
THEIR OWN YOUNGER SIBLINGS AT

568
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
THE SCHOOL.
THEY HAD A BETTER GRASP OF THE

569
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
HORROR THAT WAS UNFOLDING.

570
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
YOU CAN SEE IN THE DIFFERENCE

571
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
BETWEEN THE REACTIONS.

572
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
>> WHAT REALLY STRIKES ME,

573
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
DAVID, WE SEE THOSE IMAGES WHICH

574
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
ARE SO DISTRESSING.

575
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
YOU KNOW, THE PARENTS AS

576
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
STRESSED AND UPSET AND CONCERNED

577
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
AS THEY ALL CERTAINLY APPEAR TO

578
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
BE, THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOBS AND

579
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
THEIR JOBS IS TO TRY AND FIND

580
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
THEIR CHILDREN AND TO TRY AND

581
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN AND TO

582
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
TRY TO REMOVE THEIR CHILDREN

583
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
FROM THAT SCENE.

584
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
THAT'S WHAT THE TEACHERS DID.
THAT'S WHAT THE FACULTIES' TASK

585
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
IS.

586
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
TO SOME EXTENT, THAT'S WHAT THE

587
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
FIRST RESPONDERS TRIED TO DO

588
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
AFTER THE SCENE WAS AS SECURED

589
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
AS POSSIBLE.

590
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT,

591
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
DAVID, JUST AS WE'LL SEE THIS

592
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
FROM THE CHILDREN, WE'LL ALSO

593
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
EXPECT AND SEE FROM THE ADULTS,

594
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
FROM THE PARENTS WHO WERE AT THE

595
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
SCENE, EVEN FROM THE FIRST

596
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
RESPONDERS, ONCE THEY'RE ALONE

597
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
AND KNOW THEIR CHILDREN ARE

598
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
SAFE, THIS WILL TAKE ITS TOLL ON

599
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
THEM.

600
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
THERE'S NO QUESTION.
I MEAN, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO.

601
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
>> ONCE IT SETTLES IN, YOU HAVE

602
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
TO HAND IT TO THE BRAVERY OF

603
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
THESE TEACHERS WHO KEPT THOSE

604
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
KIDS FOCUSED ON THE SOLE

605
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
PURPOSE, THE SOLE TASK AT HAND

606
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
WHICH WAS TO GET OUT OF THAT

607
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
SCHOOL AND GET TO THE FIREHOUSE

608
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

609
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I WANTED TO PLAY FOR YOU A

610
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
MOTHER AND A DAUGHTER WHO DAN

611
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
HARRIS SPOKE TO A SHORT TIME

612
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
AGO.
SHE WAS ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS

613
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
IN THE SCHOOL WHO GOT OUT AND
HER BRAVERY WAS REALLY

614
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
SOMETHING.

615
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
SHE TALKED ABOUT THE EMOTION AND

616
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
QUITE FRANKLY ABOUT HOW SHE FELT

617
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
ON THE INSIDE.

618
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
HERE'S DAN'S MOMENT WITH THAT

619
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.

620
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
>> Reporter: YOU WERE IN THERE,

621
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
ALEXIS?

622
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
>> YES.
>> Reporter: WHAT HAPPENED?

623
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
>> NOTHING REALLY MUCH.

624
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
JUST, WE HEARD, LIKE, AN

625
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
AMBULANCE COME AND POLICE

626
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
OFFICER COME.

627
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
EVERYBODY WAS SCARED CRYING.

628
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I FELT A LITTLE SICK.

629
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I FELT LIKE I WAS GOING TO THROW

630
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
UP.

631
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
TO MY TEACHER, TOO.

632
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
>> Reporter: HOW DID YOU GET OUT

633
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
OF THERE?
>> WE HAD TO GO THROUGH THE

634
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
BUILDING AND THEN WE HAD TO JUST

635
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
GO TO THE FIREHOUSE.

636
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
>> Reporter: AND DID YOU KNOW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE TIME?

637
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
>> NO.

638
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
UNTIL OUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR

639
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
MRS. WALKER, ONE OF OUR FRIENDS

640
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
FROM -- AND THEN SHE SAID THAT

641
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
IF THERE'S A LOCKDOWN, JUST YOU

642
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
HAVE TO BE CALM AND THEN JUST

643
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
HER CLASS CAME INTO OUR ROOM AND

644
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
THEN WE JUST --

645
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
>> Reporter: WERE KIDS CRYING

646
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
AND SCREAMING?

647
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
>> YEAH.

648
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
KIDS WERE CRYING.

649
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
NOT REALLY SCREAMING BUT THEY

650
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
FELT -- THEY'RE ALL HUDDLING

651
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
TOGETHER AND THEY GOT, THEY FELT

652
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?

656
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000

658
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
>> WASIK.

659
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000

661
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
>> W-A-S-I-K.

662
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
>> Reporter: HOW DID YOU FIND

663
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
OUT ABOUT THIS?
>> THEY HAVE AN ALERT SYSTEM

664
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
THROUGH THE SCHOOL.

665
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
THEY SENT A MESSAGE SAYING -- I

666
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
DON'T REMEMBER THE MESSAGE.

667
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
SOMETHING ABOUT LOCKDOWN.

668
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
AND SO WE'RE JUST -- I FIGURED

669
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
IT WAS THE HIGH SCHOOL.

670
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT IT WAS

671
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
ACTUALLY HERE.
SO I ACTUALLY CALLED MY HUSBAND

672
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
AND SAID, CAN YOU GO FIND OUT

673
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
WHAT ACTUALLY -- WHAT ARE THEY

674
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
TALKING ABOUT?

675
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
HE GOES, GET IN THE CAR AND

676
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
DRIVE, GO GET HER, I'LL MEET YOU

677
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
AT THE SCHOOL.

678
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
HE GOT HERE.
I GOT HERE.

679
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
HE WAS ACTUALLY -- HE HAD HER IN

680
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
HIS ARMS AND, YOU KNOW, CRYING,

681
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
AND SO SHE'S JUST -- SHE GOES,

682
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
MAMA, I'M OKAY, I'M HERE.

683
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
BUT IT JUST DOESN'T EVEN SEEM

684
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
REAL.
I MEAN, I STILL, LIKE, REALLY?

685
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I MEAN, HERE IN NEWTOWN?

686
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
IN THIS SMALL TOWN?

687
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
YOU KNOW, YOU READ ABOUT THIS

688
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
EVERYWHERE ELSE, BUT HERE.

689
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
AND IT'S JUST -- IT'S HEART

690
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
WRENCHING FOR THE CHILDREN AND

691
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
FOR THE PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS

692
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
AND EVERYBODY.

693
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
JUST, I JUST CAN'T -- I CAN'T

694
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
FATHOM.
IT JUST DOESN'T EVEN SEEM REAL.

695
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
IT'S LIKE SHOULD I BE PINCHED TO

696
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
SEE IF IT REALLY IS REAL?

697
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
JUST, IT'S JUST HEART WRENCHING.

698
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
>> Reporter: FEELS LIKE A DREAM

699
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
AND A BAD DREAM.

700
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
>> IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

701
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
IT FEELS LIKE A NIGHTMARE.

702
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
YOU JUST NEVER IN A MILLION, IN

703
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
A MILLION YEARS WOULD YOU EVER

00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
THINK, YOU KNOW, YOU DROP YOUR

705
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000

706
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
KISSES, HAVE A GOOD DAY, I'LL

00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000

708
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
AND SEE YOU AT THE END OF THE

709
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
DAY.
AND YOU NEVER KNOW.

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
AND YOU COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS

714
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
EVERY DAY FOR WHAT YOU HAVE.

715
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
>> Reporter: ALEXIS, I'M REALLY

716
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

717
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
REALLY GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

718
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
YOU'RE PRETTY TOUGH.

719
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
YOU'RE PRETTY TOUGH.

720
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000

721
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000

THAT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND

726
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
HUGGING OUR CHILDREN TONIGHT.

727
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
WHEN THEY GET HOME FROM SCHOOL.

728
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
AS THIS HAS BECOME A NATIONAL

729
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
TRAGEDY.

730
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
THERE ARE IMAGES ALREADY FROM
THE WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT.

731
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
THEY HAVE SAID THAT FLAGS WILL

732
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
BE LOWERED TO HALF-STAFF AT

733
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS ACROSS THIS

734
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
COUNTRY, AT FEDERAL BUILDINGS.

735
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
WE SAW VERY EMOTIONAL PRESIDENT

736
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
OBAMA ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

737
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
THE MOST EMOTIONAL, QUITE

738
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
FRANKLY, THAT WE'VE SEEN HIM AS

739
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
PRESIDENT.
AND NOT SURPRISINGLY GIVEN HOW

740
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
OFTEN HE'S TALKED ABOUT HIS ROLE

741
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
AS A DAD, BEING EQUALLY AS

742
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
IMPORTANT, IF NOT MORE THAN HIS

743
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
ROLE AS THE PRESIDENT.

744
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
AND YOU SEE THE FLAG THERE

745
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
FLYING AT HALF-STAFF.

746
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
THIS IS GOING TO BE A TOUGH

747
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
STORY TO GET THROUGH OVER THE

748
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

749
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
WE'RE GOING TO SWING THROUGH ALL

750
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
OF OUR REPORTERS WORKING THIS

751
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
AND LET'S BEGIN WITH DAN HARRIS

752
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
AT THE SCENE.

753
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
DAN, THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE A

754
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
COUPLE OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES WE

755
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO YET.

756
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
AND FORGIVE ME FOR PUT YOU ON

757
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
THE SPOT.

758
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
WE STILL DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S

759
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
UNCLEAR WHEN THE GUNMAN WAS IN

760
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
THE BUILDING WHETHER OR NOT

761
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
AUTHORITIES ACTUALLY GOT TO HIM

762
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
OR WHETHER HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.

763
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE SECOND

764
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
SCENE THERE IN NEWTOWN, THE

765
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE TALKING
ABOUT THERE BEING A SECOND SCENE

766
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
WITH ANOTHER ADULT?

767
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
BUT WE'RE RELUCTANT TO ADD

768
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
ANYTHING MORE.

769
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'M WONDERING IF YOU'VE HEARD
ANYTHING THERE ON THE GROUND.

770
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
>> Reporter: I THINK YOU'VE PUT

771
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
YOUR FINGER ON THE TWO HUGE

772
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS.
I WOULD ADD A THIRD WHICH IS

773
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
WHAT WAS THE MOTIVE OF THE

774
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
ALLEGED SHOOTER?

775
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
WHY WOULD HE DO THIS?

776
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
IT MAY, AS OFTEN IS THE CASE IN
THESE STORY THAT YOU AND I HAVE

777
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
COVERED SO FREQUENTLY, DAVID, IN

778
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS, THE

779
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
MOTIVE IS OFTEN DEEPLY

780
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
UNSATISFYING AND ILLOGICAL BUT

781
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
WE STILL DON'T KNOW THAT.

782
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
AS TO THE QUESTIONS YOU RAISED,

783
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
WAS HE KILLED BY POLICE OFFICERS

784
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
OR WAS HE, DID HE DO THE DEED

785
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
HIMSELF?

786
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
WE SHOULD KNOW MORE SOON ON THAT

787
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
WHEN POLICE HOLD A NEWS

788
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
CONFERENCE.
DAY WERE, AS YOU SAID, RELUCTANT

789
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
TO SAY, WE JUST DON'T KNOW AT

790
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
THIS POINT.

791
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
WE DO KNOW THAT THERE WAS AN

792
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
ENORMOUS RESPONSE HERE.

793
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
HERE IN THIS WOODSY LITTLE

794
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED SANDY HOOK

795
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
WHICH IS PART OF NEWTOWN.

796
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
SO NAMED FOR A SORT OF BEND IN

797
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
THE RIVER THAT RUNS THROUGH THIS

798
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.
A SANDY BEND IN THE RIVER.

799
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, WE'VE HAD

800
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
THIS STARK JUXTAPOSITION TODAY

801
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
OF HAVING ALL OF THESE TACTICAL

802
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
TEAM OFFICER, PEOPLE IN FULL,

803
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
FULL ARMOR, WITH THEIR LONG GUNS

804
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
DRAWN.

805
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
THEY RESPONDED IN A MASSIVE WAY

806
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
WHEN THE REPORTS CAME IN OF THIS

807
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING.
SO IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THEY

808
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
TOOK THE SHOOTER'S LIFE OR
WHETHER HE, AS I SAID, DID THE

809
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
DEED, HIMSELF.

810
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
THE OTHER QUESTION, OF COURSE,

811
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
THERE IS A SECOND CRIME SCENE

812
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
HERE TONIGHT.

813
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
THERE IS ANOTHER BODY PRESENT AT

814
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
ANOTHER LOCATION.

815
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
WE BELIEVE, AS YOU SAID, AN

816
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
ADULT.
POLICE STILL WORKING THAT SCENE.

817
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
WE HOPE TO HAVE ANSWERS ON BOTH

818
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
OF THOSE FRONTS IN THE NOT TOO

819
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
DISTANT FUTURE WHEN THE POLICE

820
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
HOLD ANOTHER BRIEFING.

821
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
>> I CAN SEE THE EMERGENCY

822
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
TRUCKS BEHIND YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN THERE ON THE SCENES

823
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
REALLY FOR HOURS SINCE THIS

824
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
MORNING WHEN THE FIRST CALL CAME

825
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
INTO THE NEWSROOM.

826
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
ONE OF THE STRIKING THINGS THAT

827
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
WE LEARN FROM THIS PRESS

828
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
CONFERENCE A SHORT TIME AGO IS

829
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
THAT FIRST OF ALL WE BELIEVE

830
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
ONLY THREE PEOPLE WERE TAKEN TO

831
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
AREA HOSPITALS.

832
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
AND NOW WE'VE LEARNED THAT TWO

833
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
OF THEM WERE CHILDREN WHO DID

834
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
NOT SURVIVE.

835
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
SO ONE OF THE REALLY STARK

836
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
THINGS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR

837
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING IS THE FACT THAT

838
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
SO FEW PEOPLE HAD A CHANCE TO

839
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
GET OUT OF THAT SCHOOL.

840
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
SO FEW STUDENTS AND TEACHERS WHO

841
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
WERE TARGETED EVEN HAD A CHANCE,

842
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
WERE CARRIED OUT BY THOSE

843
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
AMBULANCES.
>> Reporter: RIGHT.

844
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
RIGHT.
AND, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE SAD

845
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN HERE

846
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
TODAY, AMONG MANY, MANY SAD

847
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
THINGS, AND YOU AND I HAVE

848
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
DISCUSSED THIS, DAVID, IS TO SEE

849
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
AMBULANCES LEAVING THE SCENE

850
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
HERE DRIVING SLOWLY, THEIR

851
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
LIGHTS NOT FLASHING.

852
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
THEY WOULD MUCH RATHER, ONE HAS

853
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
TO IMAGINE, HAVE IN THEIR CARGO

854
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
LOAD PATIENTS WHO NEED TO BE

855
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
TREATED.

856
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
THE FACT OF THE MATTER HERE IS

857
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
THIS SHOOTER WAS ALL TOO

858
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
SUCCESSFUL AND HE WAS ABLE TO

859
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
TAKE OUT A LOT OF VERY YOUNG,

860
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
YOUNG PEOPLE AS THE PRESIDENT

861
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
CALLED THEM, BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN,

862
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
AND IT'S AN INCREDIBLY SAD FACT.

863
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
ONLY THREE PEOPLE TAKEN TO THE

864
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
HOSPITAL.

865
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
WE KNOW TWO OF THEM CHILDREN.

866
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
BOTH OF THEM, UNFORTUNATELY,

867
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
DECEASED.

868
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
YOU MENTIONED THIS PLACE WHERE

869
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'M STANDING.

870
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
THIS IS THE LOCAL FIREHOUSE.

871
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
IT'S JUST UP THE STREET JUST A

872
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
LITTLE BIT FROM SANDY HOOK

873
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
THIS IS KIND OF THE EMOTIONAL

874
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
EPICENTER OF THIS STORY BECAUSE

875
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
THIS IS WHERE PARENTS WERE TOLD

876
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
TO COME TO PICK UP THEIR

877
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
CHILDREN.

878
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
SO ALL DAY LONG, WE'VE BEEN

879
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
WATCHING THESE ASTONISHINGLY

880
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
EMOTIONAL REUNIONS.

881
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
YOU SAW THE PARENT AND CHILD

882
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
ALEXIS AND HER MOM SPEAKING

883
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
EARLIER ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE

884
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
TO FINALLY BE REUNITED AFTER

885
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
THIS SCARE.

886
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
WHAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN ARE THE

887
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
PARENTS WHO ARE NOT GOING TO BE

888
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
REUNITED.

889
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
20 PARENTS, 20 FAMILIES,

890
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
SHATTERED BY WHAT HAPPENED AT

891
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
THE LITTLE SCHOOL RIGHT DOWN

892
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
THIS LITTLE ROAD HERE TODAY AND

893
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
THIS LITTLE TOWN IS NOW, AS YOU

894
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
POINTED OUT, DAVID, IN THE

895
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
HISTORY BOOKS FOR ALL THE WRONG

896
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
REASONS.
>> ALL RIGHT.

897
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
DAN HARRIS.
WITH US ALL DAY LONG.

898
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
WE'LL SEE YOU AGAIN SHORTLY.

899
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
DAN, OUR THANKS TO YOU.

900
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I WANT TO BRING IN PIERRE

901
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
THOMAS, SENIOR JUSTICE

902
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
CORRESPONDENT TONIGHT.

903
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
WE'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH EACH OF

904
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
THE POINTS HERE.
FIRST OF ALL, PIERRE, FOR THOSE

905
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
WATCHING AND JUST TUNING IN,

906
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
WHAT DO WE KNOW TONIGHT ABOUT

907
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
THE SUSPECT?
>> AGAIN, LAW ENFORCEMENT

908
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
OFFICIALS WERE INITIALLY TOLD

909
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
THAT THE SUSPECT WAS IDENTIFIED

910
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
AS A RYAN LANZA.

911
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
THERE'S NOW SOME INFORMATION

912
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
THAT IT'S, IN FACT HIS BROTHER

913
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
ADAM LANZA.

914
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE

915
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
TRYING TO GET DEFINITIVE CLARITY

916
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
ON THAT.

917
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
AS SOON AS WE KNOW THAT IS

918
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
DEFINITIVELY, ONE BROTHER OR THE

919
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
OTHER, WE'LL GET THAT

920
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
INFORMATION OUT.

921
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
AGAIN, THE INFORMATION IS THAT

922
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
THE SHOOTER IS DEAD AT THE

923
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
SCENE.
AS WE'VE REPORTED ALL AFTERNOON.

924
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
THE SUSPECT'S MOTHER, WE DO KNOW

925
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
THAT, WHO WAS AN EMPLOYEE AT THE

926
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
SCHOOL, WAS ALSO AMONG THOSE

927
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
KILLED ALONG WITH THOSE

928
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
CHILDREN.
AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

929
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
OFFICIALS NOW ARE NOW TRYING TO

930
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
SORT THROUGH PERSON'S BACKGROUND
TRYING TO GET SOME SENSE OF WHAT

931
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
THE MOTIVE MAY HAVE BEEN FOR

932
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
THIS TRAGIC SHOOTING.

933
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
>> SO THE QUESTION AT THIS HOUR

934
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
IS WHICH OF THESE TWO NAMES HAS

935
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
BEEN ATTACHED TO THE SUSPECT BY

936
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
AUTHORITIES.

937
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
THERE'S SOME QUESTION OF WHETHER

938
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
IT'S ADAM LANZA OR RYAN LANZA.

939
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
THEY'RE BOTH BROTHERS.

940
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
AS THEY SORT THROUGH THAT,

941
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
PIERRE, THE RELATIONSHIP WITH

942
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
THE WOMAN TARGETED, THE TEACHER

943
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
TARGETED IN THE SCHOOL, WOULD BE

944
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
THE SAME REGARDLESS OF WHICH

945
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
NAME IS ACTUALLY FINALLY SETTLED

946
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
UPON BY AUTHORITIES.

947
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
IF THIS WAS -- THE MOTHER,

948
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
CORRECT?

949
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

950
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
AS ONE SOURCE SAID, LOOK, YOU

951
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
HAVE A DEAD SUSPECT AT THE

952
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
SCENE, AGAIN, THE INITIAL

953
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
INFORMATION PROVIDED BY LOCAL

954
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
AUTHORITIES, THE FEDERAL

955
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN WORKING OFF

956
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
THAT INFORMATION.
BUT THEY ARE NOW BECOMING

957
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
INCREASINGLY CERTAIN THAT IT'S

958
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
PROBABLY GOING TO BE ADAM LANZA,

959
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
BUT, AGAIN, WE'LL KNOW MORE

960
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
SHORTLY.
>> BUT THIS WOULD BE A SON GOING

961
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
INTO A SCHOOL WHERE HIS MOTHER

962
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
WAS A TEACHER, AND IT WOULD

963
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
APPEAR TARGETING HER

964
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASS.
>> WELL, THAT IS THE INFORMATION

965
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE AT THE

966
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
SCHOOL WERE -- THE TARGET WAS AT

967
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
THE SCHOOL, AGAIN, THE THOUGHT,

968
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
THE EARLY THOUGHT IS THAT THE

969
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
MOTHER LIKELY WAS THE INITIAL

970
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
TARGET.

971
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
>> WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND THE

972
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
NUMBERS, PIERRE, AS THEY'VE

973
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
UNCOVERED THIS AFTERNOON.

974
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
YOU'VE COVERED A NUMBER OF

975
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
TRAGEDIES FOR US, PARTICULARLY

976
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS AROUND THE

977
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
COUNTRY.
THIS ONE, AS WE LOOK AT THE

978
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
NUMBERS.
18 CHILDREN.

979
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
TWO ADDITIONAL CHILDREN AT THE

980
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
HOSPITALS.

981
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
THIS WILL GO DOWN AS THE
DEADLIEST SCHOOL SHOOTING AT AN

982
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN THIS

983
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
COUNTRY.
>> AWFUL, AWFUL SITUATION, AS A

984
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
FATHER OF A 10-YEAR-OLD, I OFTEN

985
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
GO TO HIS SCHOOL AND I RING THE

986
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
BUZZER AND THEY LET ME WALK INTO

987
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
THE SCHOOL.

988
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
THIS IS THE KIND OF SITUATION

989
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
WHERE NO PARENT COULD EVEN

990
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
FATHOM OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS

991
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
HAPPENING.

992
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
AGAIN, AS WE TALKED TO MANY OF

993
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS

994
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
TODAY, WHO WERE TRYING TO GET

995
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
THE INFORMATION, TRYING TO

996
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
ASSESS WHAT WAS GOING ON, YOU

997
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
COULD HEAR THE SADNESS IN THEIR
VOICES AS WELL, DAVID.

998
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
>> PIERRE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

999
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
YOU BEEN WORKING YOUR SOURCES

1000
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY HERE ON

1001
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
WHAT'S BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT

1002
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
STORY.
IF I COULD, I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE

1003
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
OUR VIEWERS BACK TO THAT IMAGE.

1004
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
THE FLAG ABOVE THE WHITE HOUSE

1005
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
TONIGHT.
BECAUSE THIS HAS BECOME A

1006
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
NATIONAL TRAGEDY.

1007
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
IN TIMES OF TRAGEDY, THIS

1008
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
COUNTRY DOES COME TOGETHER AND

1009
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
LEADING THAT EFFORT WAS THE

1010
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
PRESIDENT THIS AFTERNOON WHO

1011
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
SAID BEFORE THE COUNTRY THAT HE

1012
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
ADDRESSES THIS, REACTS TO IT

1013
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
INITIALLY, AS A PARENT, NOT A

1014
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
PRESIDENT.

1015
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
FLAGS ARE NOW AT HALF-STAFF, AND

1016
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
INSIDE THAT WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT,

1017
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
HE DESCRIBED A SCENE THAT WILL

1018
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
UNFOLD.

1019
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
HE AND HIS WIFE, MICHELLE, HE

1020
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
SAID, WILL HUG THEIR DAUGHTERS

1021
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
WHEN THEY GET HOME FROM SCHOOL

1022
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
JUST AS EVERY PARENT ACROSS THIS

1023
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
COUNTRY, AND JAKE, HE WASN'T

1024
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
OVERTLY POLITICAL, BUT HE DID --

1025
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
HE DID OFFER A LITTLE BIT OF

1026
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
INSIGHT INTO WHERE HE'S THINKING

1027
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
THAT THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW

1028
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
TO PREVENT THIS HAS GOT TO MOVE

1029
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
FORWARD IN SOME SORT OF

1030
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
CONSTRUCTIVE FASHION.

1031
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT,

1032
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
DAVID.

1033
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
CONSIDERING HOW MUCH PRESIDENT
OBAMA HAS AVOIDED TALKING OR

1034
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
ACTING FOR GUN CONTROL, HE

1035
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
ORIGINALLY WHEN HIS POLITICAL
CAREER BEGAN AS A STATE SENATOR,

1036
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
WAS VERY ACTIVE IN GUN CONTROL.

1037
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
AND EVEN SOMEWHAT AS A U.S.

1038
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
SENATOR, BUT AS A PRESIDENTIAL

1039
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
CANDIDATE, HE HAS NOT TALKED

1040
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
MUCH ABOUT IT.

1041
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
CERTAINLY AS A PRESIDENT, HAS

1042
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
NOT DONE MUCH ABOUT IT.

1043
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
HE ALLUDED TO IT TODAY, TALKING

1044
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
ABOUT HOW WE NEEDED TO COME

1045
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
TOGETHER AS A SOCIETY TO PREVENT

1046
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS FROM
HAPPENING AGAIN.

1047
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
NO MATTER WHAT THE POLITICS ARE.

1048
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
THAT WOULD SEEM TO ME, BASED ON

1049
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
COVERING HIM FOR R THE LAST FIVE

1050
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
OR SIX YEARS, TO BE AT LEAST A

1051
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
NOD TOWARD GUN CONTROL, WHETHER

1052
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
IT IS HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINE

1053
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
CLIPS, OR KEEPING GUNS OUT OF

1054
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WITH A

1055
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
HISTORY OF MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL

1056
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
PROBLEMS.

1057
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

1058
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
BUT IT WAS AT LEAST AN ALLUSION

1059
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
TO IT WHICH IS MORE THAN WE'VE

1060
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
HEARD FROM HIM IN THE PAST.

1061
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
BUT BEYOND THE POLITICS OF IT,

1062
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
DAVID, OF COURSE, THERE WAS THE

1063
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
RAW EMOTION OF IT.

1064
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I'VE COVERED PRESIDENT OBAMA, AS

1065
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I SAID, FOR MORE THAN HALF A

1066
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
DECADE.

1067
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
HE IS NOT KNOWN AS A

1068
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
PARTICULARLY DEMONSTRATIVE OR

1069
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
OVERLY HISTRIONIC PERSON WHEN IT

1070
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
COMES TO HIS EMOTIONS.

1071
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
HE WAS TEARFUL TODAY IN A WAY

1072
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM EXCEPT

1073
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
FOR A COUPLE TIMES, THE DEATH OF

1074
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
HIS GRANDMOTHER WHO HELPED RAISE

1075
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
HIM SHORTLY BEFORE THE ELECTION

1076
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
IN 2008 WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE

1077
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
TIMES.

1078
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
BUT HE'S NOT SOMEBODY WHO IS

1079
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
EMOTIONAL, BUT HE REALLY HAD TO

1080
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
COLLECT HIMSELF A FEW TIMES

1081
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
DURING HIS REMARKS, NOT JUST

1082
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
WITH WIPING TEARS FROM HIS EYES

1083
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
BUT TAKING A MOMENT, SO AS TO

1084
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
SEEMINGLY TO GIRD HIMSELF

1085
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
EMOTIONALLY TO PREVENT HIMSELF

1086
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
FROM HAVING TO BREAK DOWN.

1087
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
HE DID REACT, AS HE SAID HE DID

1088
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
INITIALLY AS A FATHER, AS

1089
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
SOMEBODY WHO IS FEELING

1090
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
DEMONSTRABLE GRIEF ABOUT WHAT

1091
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
HAPPENED TODAY IN NEWTOWN,

1092
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
CONNECTICUT.
OF COURSE, WE ALL KNOW HIS

1093
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
DAUGHTER, SASHA AND MALIA, WHO

1094
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
ARE NOW 11 AND 14 YEARS OLD, HE

1095
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
SAID HE AND THE FIRST LADY

1096
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
TONIGHT WOULD DO WHAT SO MANY

1097
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
PARENTS WILL DO ACROSS THIS

1098
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
COUNTRY, HOLD HIS DAUGHTER, HOLD

1099
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
THEIR DAUGHTERS A LITTLE BIT

1100
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
TIGHTER TONIGHT.

1101
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
AND, OF COURSE, HE NOTED ALL

1102
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
THOSE FAMILIES IN CONNECTICUT

1103
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
THAT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO THE

1104
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
SAME, DAVID.

1105
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
>> WE WERE LOOKING AT IMAGES AS

1106
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
YOU WERE DESCRIBING THE

1107
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
PRESIDENT WIPING AWAY THOSE

1108
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
TEARS ALONG WITH YOUR

1109
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
DESCRIPTION OF HIM THERE IN THE

1110
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
BRIEFING ROOM.

1111
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
AND YOU AND I JUST COVERED THIS

1112
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
BRUISING CAMPAIGN, BUT ONE THING

1113
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
HIS CHALLENGER, GOVERNOR ROMNEY

1114
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
SAID THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN, WHEN

1115
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
ASKED WHAT DO YOU RESPECT THE

1116
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
PRESIDENT FOR?

1117
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
AND HE OFTEN SAID, HIS ROLE AS A

1118
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
FATHER.
THAT HE'S A DEDICATED FAMILY

1119
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
MAN.

1120
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
AND THAT MOMENT OF EMOTION THERE

1121
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY WILL

1122
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
LIKELY BE WELCOMED BY PARENTS

1123
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT IN

1124
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
PARTICULAR IN THAT ONE

1125
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
COMMUNITY, JAKE.

1126
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
>> Reporter: INDEED.
AND, IN FACT, ONE THING THAT IS

1127
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
NOT AS INTERESTING AND NOT AS

1128
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
IMPORTANT, BUT CERTAINLY I TOOK

1129
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
NOTE OF AS WELL, WHILE THE

1130
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
PRESIDENT WAS SPEAKING TO THE

1131
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
SIDE, WERE THAT HIS PRESS

1132
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
SECRETARY AND ONE OF HIS DEPUTY

1133
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
CHIEFS OF STAFF, AS IS NORMAL,

1134
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
BUT IN THIS INSTANCE, THEY WERE

1135
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
HOLDING HANDS.

1136
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
AND WIPING AWAY TEARS

1137
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
THEMSELVES.
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING

1138
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT, WHOMEVER

1139
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
HE IS, IS THE COMMANDER IN

1140
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
CHIEF, THE CARETAKER OF THE

1141
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
NATION, RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING

1142
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY SAFE.

1143
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
THAT IS THE NUMBER ONE

1144
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENT.

1145
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
EVENTS LIKE THIS, ALTHOUGH THEY

1146
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
CAN'T BE COMPARED TO HOW HARD

1147
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
IT'S HITTING PEOPLE IN NEWTOWN,

1148
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
CONNECTICUT, THEY DO HIT RATHER

1149
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
HARD HERE.

1150
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
BECAUSE PEOPLE HERE FEEL
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WELLBEING OF

1151
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

1152
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
ESPECIALLY CHILDREN.

1153
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
AND SO IT IS VERY SAD HERE

1154
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
TODAY, DAVID.
>> ALL RIGHT.

1155
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
SENIOR WHITE HOUSE

1156
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
CORRESPONDENT, JAKE TAPPER THERE

1157
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
WHERE HE'S BEEN ALL DAY

1158
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT AND HIS

1159
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
BRIEFINGS.
JAKE, THANK YOU.

1160
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
WE'LL TALK TO YOU AGAIN SOON.

1161
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
IN THE MEANTIME, I WANT TO BRING

1162
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
IN MY FRIEND CHRIS CUOMO, OF

1163
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
"2020" IN SHADY BROOK,

1164
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
CONNECTICUT.

1165
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
THE COMMUNITY SURROUNDING THAT
SCHOOL.

1166
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
CHRIS, YOU SAID YOU WERE INSIDE

1167
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
ONE OF THESE HOMES AS THIS

1168
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
PLAYED OUT TONIGHT.

1169
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
THE UNCERTAINTY AND FINDING OUT

1170
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
THE ANSWERS.

1171
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT

1172
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THE TEXT MESSAGES THAT WENT OUT,
THAT IMMEDIATE ALERT THAT SENT A

1173
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
SHOCKWAVE THROUGH THIS ENTIRE

1174
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
COMMUNITY?
PARENTS DIDN'T KNOW AT FIRST

1175
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
REALLY WHICH SCHOOL, CERTAINLY

1176
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY

1177
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
WOULD FIND THEIR CHILDREN WHEN
THEY GOT TO THAT FIREHOUSE.

1178
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, DAVID.

1179
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
THE FIRST WORD THAT THESE

1180
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
PARENTS HEARD WAS "LOCKDOWN."

1181
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
AND IMAGINE THAT.
YOU'VE GOT A KID IN A K-4 AND

1182
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
YOU'RE HEARING THE WORDS

1183
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
"LOCKDOWN."

1184
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
THEN THE PHONE TREE STARTS.

1185
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
AND THAT IT'S A SHOOTER AND THAT

1186
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
THERE ARE INJURIES AND THEN

1187
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
EVERYBODY IN THIS SMALL

1188
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
COMMUNITY RUSHES THIS PLACE, THE

1189
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
PLACE HAS BEEN CHOKED WITH

1190
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
TRAFFIC ALL DAY.

1191
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
AND THEY COULDN'T GET WITHIN A

1192
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
QUARTER MILE OF THE SCHOOL, SO

1193
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
THEN THEY RUN UP TO THE SCHOOL.

1194
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
POLICE ARE HECTIC AND HURRIED AT

1195
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
THE SAME TIME.
THERE'S RUMOR OF A SECOND

1196
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
SHOOTER.

1197
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
THESE PARENTS ARE DESPERATE FOR

1198
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
THEIR KIDS.

1199
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
THEY WIND UP COMING TO A

1200
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
FIREHOUSE.

1201
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
HOLDING UP SIGNS.

1202
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
DESPERATELY SEARCHING AROUND.

1203
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
ALL THESE KIDS ALL LOOK THE SAME

1204
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
WITHIN THAT AGE RANGE.

1205
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
OVER TIME THEY START CONNECTING

1206
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
WITH A FACE, THEY SEE A

1207
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
TEACHER'S AIDE, SEE A TEACHER,

1208
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
SEE THEIR OWN KID.

1209
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
LIVES FROM FROM THE DARKEST OF

1210
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
MOMENTS INTO THE MOST GUILTY OF

1211
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
FEELING GOOD IN A SITUATION

1212
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR KID.
I SAT WITH THESE MOTHERS AND

1213
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
FATHERS TODAY WHO DIDN'T KNOW

1214
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
WHERE THEIR KID WAS AND DIDN'T

1215
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
KNOW WHICH WAY IT WAS GOING TO

1216
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
GO.

1217
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
THERE WERE OTHER PARENTS WHO

1218
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
LOST THEIR KIDS TODAY.

1219
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
AND THEN THEY WOUND UP HAVING

1220
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
THEIRS COME HOME.

1221
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
AND THEY'RE COMING TOGETHER IN

1222
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
THEIR HOMES, THEY'RE COMING

1223
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
TOGETHER IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS IN

1224
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
WHAT IS UNFIXABLE.

1225
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
IN TERMS OF THE PAIN AND THE

1226
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
SENSELESSNESS.
WE'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE, BUT

1227
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
FOR THESE FAMILIES, IT'S ALL NEW

1228
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
AND THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO HANDLE

1229
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
WHAT TO TELL THEIR KIDS.

1230
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
IT'S ONE OF THE COMPLICATING

1231
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
FACTORS OF THIS STORY FOR THE

1232
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
VICTIMS AND EVEN FOR EVERYONE

1233
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
INVOLVED.
WHAT DO YOU TELL THE KIDS WHO

1234
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
ARE AT THE CENTER OF IT WHO ARE

1235
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

1236
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
HAPPENED?

1237
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW

1238
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
THESE TYPES OF THINGS.

1239
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
THAT'S HOW YOUNG THOSE KIDS

1240
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
WERE, DAVID.
THAT'S WHAT THE FAMILIES ARE

1241
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
STRUGGLING WITH TONIGHT.

1242
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
>> YOU KNOW THE CALENDAR, IT'S

1243
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
DECEMBER 14th.

1244
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
THE COUNTDOWN IS ON TO

1245
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
CHRISTMAS.

1246
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
AND YOU'RE A DAD, YOURSELF.

1247
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE AN INTERNAL

1248
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
CLOCK.

1249
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
THEY WAKE UP EVERY MORNING

1250
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
KNOWING HOW MANY DAYS UNTIL

1251
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
SANTA COMES.

1252
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
>> YOU KNOW, THESE PARENTS, I

1253
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
WATCHED THEM.

1254
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
YOU WATCH THEM, YOU KNOW, THEY

1255
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
SHATTER A LITTLE BIT LISTENING

1256
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
TO THEIR LITTLE GIRL.

1257
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
SHE'S GOT NEW TEETH IN THE FRONT

1258
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
OF HER MOUTH.
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT AN AMERICAN

1259
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
GIRL DOLL.

1260
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
AND THAT'S WHAT WAS ON HER MIND

1261
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
THIS MORNING.

1262
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
IT'S WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON

1263
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
HER MIND THIS MORNING.

1264
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
THE NEXT THING SHE HEARS ARE

1265
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
LOUD BANGS.
WE KNOW WHAT THEY WERE.

1266
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
SHE DIDN'T.

1267
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
AND THE TEACHER KEEPING THEIR

1268
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
POISE IN THE WORST OF MOMENTS.

1269
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
AND SHE COULD KEEP FOCUSED ON

1270
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
CHRISTMAS.
SHE'S TOLD TO CLOSE HER EYES

1271
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
TIGHTLY AND SHE DOES BECAUSE

1272
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
SHE'S SO YOUNG.

1273
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT SHE

1274
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
MOVES PAST.

1275
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
WHAT'S INSIDE THAT SCHOOL RIGHT

1276
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
NOW.
WHICH FAMILIES ARE NEVER GOING

1277
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
TO RECOVER FROM.

1278
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
AND THIS BEING AT CHRISTMAS IS A

1279
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
MIXED SITUATION, BECAUSE AT

1280
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
ONCE, IT MAKES IS SO MUCH WORSE

1281
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
BECAUSE YOU WERE SO CLOSE TO

1282
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING TO MAKE

1283
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
PEOPLE HAPPY.

1284
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
YET, MORE FAMILIES HERE THAN NOT

1285
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
WHO GOT CHRISTMAS EARLY TODAY.

1286
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
THE NUMBERS ARE STAGGERING.

1287
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
NO ONE COULD TAKE IT AWAY.

1288
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY KIDS ARE

1289
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
LEFT INSIDE THAT SCHOOL YET.
BUT THESE FAMILIES, A LOT OF

1290
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
THEM GOT CHRISTMAS EARLY, DAVID,

1291
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GIFT THAT

1292
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
FOR MOMENTS TODAY THEY DID NOT

1293
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
KNOW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO

1294
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
HAVE.

1295
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
THAT IS A PAIN FOR THE PARENTS.

1296
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,

1297
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
CHRIS.

1298
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
FOR THE CHILDREN, SANTA WILL BE

1299
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
PLAYING A MORE OUTSIZED ROLE

1300
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
THIS YEAR, FROM AN ESCAPE OF

1301
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
WHAT IT IS THEY JUST SURVIVED.

1302
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I WANT TO CHECK BACK IN WITH

1303
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
PIERRE THOMAS.
OBVIOUSLY HE'S BEEN TRYING TO

1304
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
SORT THROUGH THIS DEVELOPING

1305
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
INVESTIGATION.
THERE HAD BEEN SOME QUESTION

1306
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
ABOUT WHICH OF THE TWO SONS

1307
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
MIGHT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN

1308
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
TARGETING THEIR MOTHER.

1309
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES.

1310
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
PIERRE, ARE WE ANY CLOSER?

1311
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
>> Reporter: YES, WE HAVE AT

1312
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
LEAST TWO SOURCES NOW WHO HAVE

1313
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
GONE BACK AND DOUBLE CHECKED THE

1314
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
INFORMATION.

1315
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
THE INITIAL INFORMATION WAS

1316
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
PROVIDED, WAS RYAN LANZA.

1317
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
THEY'RE NOW SAYING THEY'RE

1318
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
PRETTY MUCH CERTAIN, CERTAIN

1319
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
THAT IT'S GOING TO TURN OUT TO

1320
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
BE ADAM LANZA WHO WAS 20 YEARS

1321
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
OLD.

1322
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
THE YOUNGER BROTHER.

1323
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
WHO THEY BELIEVE TO BE THE

1324
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
PERSON WHO WENT INTO THE SCHOOL

1325
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
AND DID THE SHOOTING.

1326
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
>> AND THERE'S SOME REPORTING,

1327
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
PIERRE, THAT THE OTHER BROTHER

1328
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
IS BEING QUESTIONED A THIS

1329
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
POINT.

1330
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
WHAT CAN YOU ADD TO THAT?

1331
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY CLARITY ON

1332
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
THAT YET, BUT ANY PERSON WHO'S

1333
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
ASSOCIATED WITH THE BELIEVED

1334
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
SHOOTER IS A PERSON THAT WILL BE

1335
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
TALKED TO BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.

1336
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
>> AND, OF COURSE, THE BIG

1337
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
QUESTION, AT THIS HOUR, AMONG

1338
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
MANY, IS THE SECOND SCENE IN

1339
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, PIERRE,

1340
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
AND IS THERE ANY MORE GUIDANCE

1341
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
ON WHAT THEY'RE SEARCHING FOR

1342
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
AND WHO THE PERSON IS WHO'S

1343
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
DECEASED AT THAT LOCATION?

1344
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
>> AGAIN, ALL WE KNOW SO FAR,

1345
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
IT'S ANOTHER PERSON WHO'S DEAD.

1346
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
SOMEHOW ASSOCIATED WITH THE

1347
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
YOUNG MAN WHO IS BELIEVED TO

1348
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
HAVE DONE THE SHOOTING.

1349
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
AGAIN, NO DIRECT CONFIRMATION

1350
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
EXACTLY WHO THAT IS YET.

1351
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
>> PIERRE, WE'LL CHECK BACK IN

1352
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
WITH YOU SHORTLY.

1353
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I WANT TO CHECK IN WITH YOUR

1354
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
COLLEAGUE, JIM, WHO IS UP FROM

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
WASHINGTON, AND IN THE REGION

1356
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
COVERING THE STORY.

1357
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
AND, JIM HAS BEEN LOOKING INTO

1358
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
THE FAMILY DYNAMIC, TOO.

1359
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
AND I KNOW SO LITTLE IS KNOWN AT

1360
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
THIS POINT, BUT JIM, CAN YOU

1361
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
SHED ANY LIGHT ON THE FAMILY

1362
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE,

1363
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
THE LANZA FAMILY, THE MOTHER WHO

1364
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
IS THE KINDER GARDEN TEACHER,

1365
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
AND, OF COURSE, TRYING TO FIGURE

1366
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
OUT WHICH OF THE CHILDREN

1367
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE ZEROING IN ON.

1368
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
>> LOOK, DAVID, JUST FOLLOWING

1369
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
UP ON WHAT PIERRE JUST REPORTED,

1370
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
IF INDEED THE SHOOTER TURNS OUT

1371
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
TO BE ADAM, I JUST SPOKE WITH A

1372
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
LOCAL REALTOR HERE NAMED BARBARA

1373
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
FRY WHO IS A NEIGHBOR OF THAT

1374
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
FAMILY.
HER SON WENT TO SCHOOL AT THE

1375
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

1376
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
WITH ADAM.

1377
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
SHE DESCRIBED TO ME THAT ADAM,

1378
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
IN FACT, WAS A BIT OF A TROUBLED

1379
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
CHILD.

1380
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
THAT SHE DESCRIBES THE MOTHER AS

1381
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
SAYING THAT -- DESCRIBES THE

1382
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
MOTHER SAYING HE HAD ASPERGER'S

1383
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
AND ALSO SUFFERED FROM OCD.

1384
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
SHE QUOTES THE MOTHER AS SAYING

1385
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
THAT.

1386
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
SHE ALSO SAYS THE MOTHER, SHE

1387
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
KNEW THE MOTHER BRIEFLY AND THAT

1388
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
THE MOTHER WAS A DIGNIFIED

1389
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
WOMAN, IS WHAT SHE SAID, BUT

1390
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
THAT SHE WAS A VERY STRICT

1391
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
PARENT.

1392
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
AND THAT SOMETIMES HER SON,

1393
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
ADAM, WOULD REBEL AT THAT AS HER

1394
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
CHILDREN GREW UP WITH ADAM.

1395
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
SO THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF A

1396
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
PORTRAIT WE'RE GETTING OF THE

1397
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
FAMILY WE'RE GETTING FROM HERE,

1398
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
IF IT IS ADAM, HE MAY HAVE HAD

1399
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
SOME KIND OF TROUBLE, SOME KIND

1400
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
OF LEARNING DISABILITY, OCD OR

1401
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
ASPERGER'S OF SOME KIND.

1402
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GETTING FROM

1403
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
PEOPLE HERE.

1404
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
WE'VE ALSO BEEN REPORTING ON THE

1405
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
SCHOOL, ITSELF, DAVID.

1406
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I'LL JUST TELL YOU THAT THIS IS

1407
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
A VERY SPECIAL SCHOOL, AND I

1408
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
MEAN THAT IN THE TERMS OF

1409
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
HONORED AND, AN HONORED SCHOOL,

1410
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
A SCHOOL WHERE PEOPLE, IN FACT,

1411
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
MOVE TO NEWTOWN SO THEY COULD GO

1412
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN GO TO THIS

1413
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
SCHOOL.
IN FACT, PARENTS OFTEN HAD

1414
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
LONGER COMMUTES BUT THEY WANTED

1415
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
TO LIVE HERE BECAUSE THE SCHOOL

1416
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
WAS SO GOOD AND THE TEACHERS

1417
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
WERE SO -- HAD SUCH A GREAT

1418
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
REPUTATION.
>> AND, JIM, WE REPORTED THIS

1419
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
EARLIER, STICK WITH US HERE,

1420
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
BECAUSE THIS SCHOOL SEEMED TO BE

1421
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT WHEN IT

1422
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
COMES TO PROTECTING YOUR

1423
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
CHILDREN.
WHEN YOU TRAVEL TO THESE SCHOOLS

1424
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO DO STORIES

1425
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
OR IF YOU'RE A PARENT OR UNCLE

1426
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
AND GOING TO PICK UP THE

1427
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
CHILDREN FROM SCHOOL, OFTEN

1428
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
THERE ARE THESE PROCEDURES IN

1429
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
PLACE, NOT METAL DETECTERS,

1430
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME OF THOSE

1431
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
AT SCHOOLS IN THIS COUNTRY.
MORE OFTEN IT'S THE CASE THAT

1432
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
YOU WALK IN, THERE'S SOME SORT

1433
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
OF CAMERA INVOLVED AND A SIGN-IN

1434
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
DESK IN THE OFFICE AND THAT'S

1435
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAD DONE JUST

1436
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
THIS YEAR IS TO ADD SOME SORT OF

1437
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
VISUAL MONITORING SYSTEM.

1438
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
YOU GET THROUGH THAT, HAVE TO GO

1439
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
TO THE OFFICE, SHOW I.D.

1440
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
THEY EVEN SENT OUT A LETTER

1441
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
SAYING IT MIGHT BE A BIT OF A

1442
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
HASSLE, BUT PLEASE UNDERSTAND US

1443
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
THAT WE HAVE TO DO THIS IN

1444
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
ASKING FOR I.D.

1445
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
CERTAINLY WE NOW KNOW HOW

1446
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
IMPORTANT THAT IS.

1447
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
BUT AS YOU POINT OUT, THIS WOULD

1448
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
SEEM TO BE A SCHOOL THAT WAS

1449
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
TRYING TO DO JUST ABOUT

1450
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
EVERYTHING IT COULD FOR THE

1451
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
WELLBEING, THE WELFARE OF ITS

1452
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
LITTLE CHILDREN.
>> YES.

1453
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I JUST SPOKE WITH A FORMER

1454
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
STUDENT WHO'S NOW IN COLLEGE WHO

1455
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
WENT TO SANDY HOOK, AND SHE SAID

1456
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
THAT WHEN SHE WAS IN ELEMENTARY

1457
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
SCHOOL THERE, THEY EVEN HAD

1458
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
DRILLS BACK THEN.

1459
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
AND THAT THE PARENTS, THE

1460
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
TEACHERS WOULD TELL THE CHILDREN

1461
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
THAT WE'RE HAVING A DRILL NOW,

1462
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE

1463
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
CORNERS OF THE CLASSROOM AND

1464
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE QUIET AND

1465
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
WAIT FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTION AND

1466
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
THEY WERE TOLD IN ADVANCE HOW TO

1467
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
HANDLE THIS.
AND THAT'S, IN FACT, A YOUNG

1468
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
STUDENT TOLD ME THAT WHEN SHE

1469
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
HEARD TODAY ABOUT THESE STORIES

1470
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
OF THESE LITTLE KIDS RUNNING

1471
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
INTO CLOSETS AND HIDING IN

1472
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
CLOSETS AND HIDING FROM A

1473
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
GUNMAN, THAT, IN FACT, IT SENT

1474
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
CHILLS UP HER SPINE BECAUSE SHE

1475
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
REMEMBERED THOSE DRILLS AND WHAT

1476
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
THESE KIDS WERE GOING THROUGH.

1477
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
>> YEAH.
>> SO IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT

1478
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
TIME FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS

1479
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
COMMUNITY.

1480
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
BECAUSE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

1481
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
SCHOOL IS SORT OF THE JEWEL OF

1482
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
THIS COMMUNITY AND SOMETHING

1483
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
THAT THE SCHOOL HAD HAD A

1484
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
REPUTATION FOR SOMETHING TOTALLY

1485
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
DIFFERENT.

1486
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
>> LET'S JUST SAY IT'S STILL A

1487
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
JEWEL TONIGHT BECAUSE, JIM, AS

1488
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
YOU KNOW, ON THIS END OF

1489
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
REPORTING THE STORY, WE'VE BEEN

1490
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
WATCHING THE IMAGES OF THESE

1491
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
DEDICATED TEACHERS,

1492
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
EXTRAORDINARY BRAVERY AS THEY

1493
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
TOOK THOSE CHILDREN OUT OF THE

1494
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
SCHOOL TODAY.
WE CAN SEE SOME OF THE CLERGY,

1495
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
THIS NUN HERE IN THIS IMAGE

1496
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
ARRIVING AT THE SCENE.

1497
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT IMAGES

1498
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
JUST COMING INTO US NOW, I WANT
TO BRING JEN ASHTON, A DOCTOR

1499
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
WITH OUR MEDICAL TEAM, IN ON THE

1500
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
CONVERSATION.

1501
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
YOU WERE NODDING YOUR HEAD AS

1502
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
JIM TALKED ABOUT, REALLY A WAY

1503
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
OF LIFE IN SCHOOLS IN AMERICA

1504
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
RIGHT NOW.

1505
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
THESE DRILLS THAT STUDENTS GO

1506
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
THROUGH.
EVEN AT THE VERY YOUNGEST OF

1507
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
AGES WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY

1508
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
THEY WERE SO CALM AND FOLLOWED

1509
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
EVERYTHING RIGHT DOWN TO A "T"

1510
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
IN GETTING OUT OF THAT SCHOOL

1511
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
TODAY.

1512
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
>> YEAH.
I THINK THIS IS A REALITY OF THE

1513
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
TIMES IN WHICH WE LIVE, DAVID.

1514
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
MY OWN CHILDREN HAVE LOCKDOWN

1515
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
DRILLS REGULARLY AT THEIR SCHOOL

1516
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
AND THEY EXPLAIN THEM AND

1517
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
DESCRIBE THEM TO ME IN EXPLICIT

1518
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
DETAIL.
YOU KNOW, THEY ARE TOLD THAT

1519
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
THEY HAVE 60 SECONDS TO GET INTO

1520
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
THE CLOSEST BUILDING, THE

1521
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
TEACHERS LOCK THE DOORS.

1522
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
THEY ARE THEN INSTRUCTED TO GO

1523
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
INTO CLASSROOMS WHERE THEY ARE

1524
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
TOLD TO GET UNDER DESKS, IN THE

1525
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
CORNER OF THE ROOM.

1526
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
THE SHADES ARE PULLED.

1527
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
THE CLASSROOM DOORS ARE LOCKED.

1528
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I MEAN, THESE THINGS ARE REALLY

1529
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
ROUTINE NOW MANY MANY, MANY

1530
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
SCHOOLS.

1531
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
SO I THINK THAT EVEN AT THESE

1532
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
YOUNG AGES IN ELEMENTARY

1533
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
SCHOOLS, YES, THESE DRILLS WERE

1534
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
PRACTICED AS ANY DISASTER DRILL

1535
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
IS PRACTICED.

1536
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU NEVER WANT TO

1537
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
NEED TO USE THOSE SKILLS, BUT

1538
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
THEY ARE UNFORTUNATELY ROUTINE

1539
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
NOW IN MANY, MANY SCHOOLS.

1540
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
MY CHILDREN'S INCLUDED.

1541
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
>> THEY WERE EMPLOYED TODAY, AND

1542
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I WANT TO KEEP WITH THESE

1543
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
PICTURES HERE NOW IF WE COULD.

1544
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
BUT, JEN, I WAS STRUCK BY THE

1545
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
CHILDREN INSIDE THAT FIRST GRADE

1546
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
CLASSROOM.
THE TEACHER WHO SAID SHE HAD

1547
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
THEM HIDING IN THE BATHROOM IN

1548
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
THE CLASSROOM.
AND ONE OF THE FIRST INSTINCTS,

1549
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
THESE ARE FIRST GRADERS, WAS TO

1550
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
ASK, HOW ARE THE OTHER KIDS OUT

1551
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
THERE?
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE

1552
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
WE CAN GET INTO THE BATHROOM?

1553
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
>> WHEN YOU SEE A DISASTER LIKE

1554
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
THIS, DAVID, YOU SEE REFLEX

1555
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
BEHAVIOR, INSTINCTIVE BEHAVIOR

1556
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
AND REACTION BECOME AUTOMATIC.

1557
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
>> BUT AT 6 YEARS OLD.

1558
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
>> INSTINCT AND REACTIONS OF

1559
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
THOSE 6-YEAR-OLDS, INSTINCTS AND

1560
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
REACTIONS OF ANY ADULT THERE.

1561
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN AROUND A

1562
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
CHILD, WHETHER YOU'RE A PARENT

1563
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
OR NOT, YOU KNOW THAT YOUR

1564
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
INSTINCTIVE HUMAN REACTION IS TO

1565
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
PROTECT THAT CHILD.

1566
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
THAT'S WHAT THESE TEACHERS DID.

1567
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
AND THE CHILDREN, YOU KNOW, YES,

1568
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
THEY'RE BRAVE, YES, THEY'RE

1569
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
SELFLESS, BUT THEIR INSTINCTS

1570
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
KICK IN AND WE SEE THAT ACROSS

1571
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
THE BOARD WITH THIS TYPE OF

1572
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
TRAGEDY HERE.

1573
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
>> WE'RE LOOKING AT PICTURES

1574
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
NOW, PARENTS, OR PERHAPS

1575
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
GRANDPARENTS PICKING UP THEIR

1576
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
CHILDREN TODAY.
THE AMBULANCES THAT ARRIVED WITH

1577
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
THEIR LIGHTS GOING AND THEN AS

1578
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
DAN HARRIS REPORTED EARLIER,

1579
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
PARKED THERE.

1580
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
THE LIGHTS TURNING OFF.
THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS I

1581
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
HEARD FROM ONE DOCTOR TODAY WHO

1582
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
SAID WHAT THEY WERE EXPECTING

1583
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
WAS TO DEAL WITH AN INFLUX OF

1584
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
PATIENTS WHO HAD BEEN CARRIED IN

1585
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

1586
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
INSTEAD WHAT THEY GOT WAS A

1587
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
SITUATION VERY MUCH LIKE WHAT WE

1588
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
SAW ON 9/11, WAS THAT EMERGENCY

1589
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
ROOMS WERE READY AND NO ONE

1590
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
CAME.
>> RIGHT.

1591
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
LET ME TAKE YOU INSIDE THE
HOSPITAL, DAVID, TO THESE CLOSE

1592
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
HOSPITALS.
THESE TRAUMA CENTERS.

1593
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
TO WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN

1594
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
DOING IN PREPARATION FOR THIS

1595
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
TYPE OF MASS CASUALTY TRAUMA

1596
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
SITUATION.
THEY IMMEDIATELY STOP ALL

1597
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
ELECTIVE SURGERY, THEY WILL

1598
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
CLEAR OUT THE TRAUMA BAYS IN THE

1599
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
EMERGENCY ROOM.
THEY NOTIFY THE BLOOD BANK.

1600
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
THEY MAKE SURE THEY HAVE MASSIVE

1601
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
READY AMOUNTS OF BLOOD

1602
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
TRANSFUSIONS AVAILABLE FOR THE

1603
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
INCOMING PATIENTS.

1604
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
AND THEY DESIGNATE SOMETIMES

1605
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
BETWEEN 10 AND 20 MEDICAL

1606
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
PERSONNEL PER PATIENT AND

1607
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME, THEY

1608
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
GOT VERY, VERY FEW,

1609
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT WERE AROUND.

1610
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS TYPE OF

1611
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
DISASTER DRILL, TRAUMA DRILL,

1612
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
ROUTINE AT ANY LEVEL 1 TRAUMA

1613
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
CENTER.

1614
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
>> WE WANT TO BRING IN BRAD

1615
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
GARRETT, WHO'S AN FBI PROFILER,

1616
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
FORMALLY WITH THE FBI AND WORKS

1617
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
WITH US HERE AT ABC NEWS.

1618
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
BRAD, AS WE LOOK AT THIS AND WE

1619
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
TRY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WHICH OF

1620
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
THESE TWO BROTHERS IT WAS, WHAT

1621
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
DOESN'T CHANGE IS THE

1622
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
RELATIONSHIP THAT THIS WAS --

1623
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
THIS WAS SON AND THIS WAS

1624
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
MOTHER.

1625
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
SHE WAS A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER.

1626
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
AND FOR SOME REASON THE SUSPECT

1627
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
APPEARED AT HER DOORWAY TODAY

1628
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE

1629
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
PART OF THIS AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

1630
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
>> I THINK ONE OF THE MORE

1631
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
INTERESTING REPORTINGS IS THAT

1632
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
IF WE HAVE THE RIGHT SON, HE HAD

1633
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
SOME LEARNING DISABILITIES.

1634
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A CHILD

1635
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
EXCLUDING WHAT HAPPENED TODAY

1636
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
GROWING UP MORE FRUSTRATED, MANY

1637
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
TIMES FEELING MORE ALIENATED

1638
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFICULTIES

1639
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS.

1640
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
AND SO TO GO BACK TO WHAT WE

1641
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
BRIEFLY TALKED ABOUT EARLIER,

1642
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
THIS SORT OF GOES UP AND IT

1643
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
ESCALATES AS THEY GET OLDER,

1644
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
THEY GET MORE ANGRY.

1645
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
AND SO RESULT, I THINK HE JUST

1646
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
COULDN'T TAKE IT ANY MORE AND HE

1647
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
WANTED TO EMPOWER HIMSELF.

1648
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
AND UNFORTUNATELY HE CHOSE A

1649
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
HORRIBLE WAY TO DO IT.

1650
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
>> IT ALMOST SOUNDS -- SOME ARE

1651
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
TALKING ABOUT THIS NOTION OF

1652
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
SOME SORT OF A SUICIDE MISSION,

1653
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
IF YOU HAVE A SUSPECT.

1654
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
WE CLEARLY DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR

1655
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
NOT HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.

1656
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
IF THAT'S THE CASE IN GOING TO

1657
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
TWO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, THE

1658
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
MOTHER NOW DEAD.
THE TEACHER.

1659
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
AND 18 CHILDREN IN THAT SCHOOL

1660
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
IN TWO SEPARATE ROOMS, MANY OF

1661
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
THE CHILDREN IN HER OWN

1662
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
CLASSROOM AND THEN THE TWO

1663
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
CHILDREN WHO DIED AT THE

1664
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
HOSPITAL LATER.

1665
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO LOOKED INTO

1666
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
THAT CLASSROOM AND SAW

1667
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
5-YEAR-OLDS SITTING THERE AND

1668
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
STILL WAS ABLE TO, CAPABLE

1669
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
OBVIOUS PULLING THIS OFF WHICH

1670
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
IS JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO

1671
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
COMPREHEND.

1672
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
>> BUT THEY WEREN'T 5-YEAR-OLDS

1673
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
TO HIM.

1674
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
THEY WERE JUST OBJECTS.

1675
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
THEY WERE SOMETHING THAT WAS

1676
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
CONNECTED TO HIS MOTHER.

1677
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
YOU HAVE TO WIPE AWAY ANY

1678
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
EMPATHY, ANY BELIEF OR FEELING

1679
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
THAT HE HAS ABOUT ANYONE ELSE

1680
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
EXCEPT HIMSELF.

1681
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
THIS IS ALL ABOUT ME.

1682
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
THESE MASS SHOOTERS COULD CARE

1683
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
LESS ABOUT THE REST OF US.

1684
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET --

1685
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
THEY'RE GOING TO SEEK REVENGE

1686
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
AND IF THE PERSON THAT WRONGED

1687
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
THEM IS TOUCHING OTHER PEOPLE,

1688
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
THEY'RE GOING TO GET RID OF

1689
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
THEM.

1690
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
SO IF IT ENDS UP BEING THAT THE

1691
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
SHOOTER, MR. LANZA, SHOT

1692
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
HIMSELF, DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

1693
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I TELL YOU WHY.

1694
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
THEN HE'S ACTUALLY CONTROLLING

1695
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
THE ULTIMATE END TO HIS LIFE.

1696
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
THAT HE TOOK HIS LIFE BEFORE HE

1697
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
ALLOWED LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TAKE

1698
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
IT.

1699
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
SO, LIKE, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
TALK TO ME, I'M GOING TO TAKE

1700
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
THIS WITH ME.

1701
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
SO WE HAVE SEEN THAT ACROSS THE

1702
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
BOARD IN THESE SHOOTINGS.

1703
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
>> BRAD, STAY WITH US HERE.

1704
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
YOU'VE BEEN SO HELPFUL

1705
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

1706
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
IT'S STILL HARD FOR ANYONE TO

1707
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
ACCEPT THAT SOMEONE COULDN'T

1708
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
HAVE EMPATHY FOR CHILDREN

1709
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
SITTING IN A SCHOOL CLASSROOM.

1710
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
BUT THAT'S THE MENTAL HEALTH

1711
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
COMPONENT OF THIS.

1712
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
AND WHY WE NEED TO REPORT THAT

1713
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
IN THE COMING DAYS, TOO SO WE

1714
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
CAN TRY TO SEE THESE WARNING

1715
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
SIGNS BEFORE SOMETHING LIKE THIS

1716
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
CAN DEVELOP.

1717
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
BUT WE'VE LEARNED THAT THERE'S

1718
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
GOING TO BE A PRAYER VIGIL AT

1719
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
THE NEWTOWN UNITED METHODIST

1720
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
CHURCH.
THAT'S THIS EVENING WE BELIEVE.

1721
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
THEY SECURED A LOCATION THERE

1722
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
FOR PEOPLE TO COME AND PRAY

1723
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
TOGETHER.

1724
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
THIS IS GOING TO BE A COMMUNITY

1725
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
THAT, AS JIM POINTED OUT, HAD

1726
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
LONG COME TOGETHER.

1727
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
THIS WAS A SCHOOL THAT PRIDED

1728
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
ITSELF ON ITS AWARDS AND WHAT IT

1729
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
WAS ABLE TO DO FOR ITS CHILDREN,

1730
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
EDUCATIONALLY.
WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT THE

1731
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES FOR

1732
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
KEEPING THEIR CHILDREN SAFE,

1733
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
EMPLOYED JUST THIS YEAR.

1734
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
AND TONIGHT, IT'S NOW A

1735
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
COMMUNITY THAT WILL HUG LIKE THE

1736
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
HUG YOU SAW THERE JUST NOW ON

1737
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
THE SCREEN AND COME TOGETHER AT

1738
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
THIS VIGIL.

1739
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
THE INVESTIGATION AND THE

1740
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
PRODUCERS WILL LET ME KNOW WHEN

1741
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I HAVE PIERRE THOMAS BACK ON THE

1742
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
LINE, CONTINUES TONIGHT, AND FOR

1743
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
THOSE OF YOU JOINING US, LOOKING

1744
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
FOR YOUR LOCAL NEWS A SHORT TIME

1745
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
FROM NOW, IN MUCH OF THIS

1746
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
COUNTRY, WE WANTED TO BRING YOU

1747
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
UP TO SPEED.

1748
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
THERE ARE TWO LOCATIONS TONIGHT

1749
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
WHERE INVESTIGATORS ARE.

1750
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
THE SCHOOL AND THE SECOND

1751
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
LOCATION.

1752
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
IS THAT NOT CORRECT, PIERRE?

1753
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

1754
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
AND, AGAIN, WE ARE GETTING

1755
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
ADDITIONAL CONFIRMATION THAT

1756
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
ADAM LANZA, AGE 20, IS THOUGHT

1757
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
TO BE THE SHOOTER AS WE JUST

1758
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
REPORTED A FEW MOMENTS AGO.

1759
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS

1760
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
ARE NOW DISSECTING HIS LIFE,

1761
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

1762
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
MOTIVE MAY HAVE BEEN.

1763
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
THEY BELIEVE THAT HE WENT TO THE

1764
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
SCHOOL IN PART, THE EARLY THEORY

1765
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
IS, TO KILL HIS MOTHER WHO

1766
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
WORKED AT THE SCHOOL.

1767
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE

1768
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
NOW, WE'RE ALSO BEING TOLD BY A

1769
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
NUMBER OF SOURCES, SPEAKING WITH

1770
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
AND INTERVIEWING HIS BROTHER,

1771
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
RYAN, WHO'S AGE 24.
>> DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA, PIERRE,

1772
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
ABOUT WHAT HE HAD ON HIS PERSON?

1773
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
HE'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS WEARING A

1774
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
VEST CARRYING FOUR WEAPONS, I

1775
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
BELIEVE, YOU REPORTED EARLIER

1776
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
TODAY, AND THERE WAS ONE MOTHER

1777
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
WHO TOLD US EARLIER IN OUR

1778
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
REPORTING AND TALKING WITH DIANE

1779
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
SAYING THERE WAS WORD OF A MASK.

1780
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
YOU WOULD KNOW BETTER THAN ANY

1781
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
OF US.

1782
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT WE KNOW HE

1783
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
HAD ON WHEN HE ENTERED THAT

1784
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
SCHOOL?

1785
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
>> WHAT WE KNOW OFFICIALLY WE'RE

1786
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
TOLD AT LEAST TWO HANDGUNS WERE

1787
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
RECOVERED NEAR THE SHOOTER'S

1788
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
BODY.
THAT THEY ALSO FOUND SHELL

1789
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
CASINGS WHICH APPEAR TO BE FROM

1790
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
A .223 ASSAULT-STYLE RIFLE.

1791
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
WE DON'T HAVE CONFIRMATION ON IT

1792
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
YET AS TO WHETHER THAT RIFLE HAS

1793
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
BEEN RECOVERED.

1794
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
SO LAW ENFORCEMENT, AGAIN, IS

1795
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
METICULOUSLY GOING THROUGH THAT

1796
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
CRIME SCENE TRYING TO GATHER ALL

1797
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
THE EVIDENCE THEY CAN AS WELL AS

1798
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
TRYING TO RECONSTRUCT THIS MAN'S

1799
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
FINAL FEW DAYS.

1800
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
>> IN THE FOLLOW-UP OF THE

1801
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
INVESTIGATIONS, THESE ARE THE

1802
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
KIND OF QUESTIONS THAT GET

1803
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
CLEARED UP WITH TIME.

1804
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
THERE WAS SOME INITIAL REPORTING

1805
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
PERHAPS ONE OF THEM LIVED IN NEW

1806
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
JERSEY, ONE OF THE SONS, BUT IT

1807
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
WOULD SEEM THAT THE FAMILY LIVED

1808
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
IN NEWTOWN, IS THAT CORRECT?

1809
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
>> WELL, DAVID, YOU KNOW, IN

1810
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
THESE SITUATIONS, HAVING COVERED

1811
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
THEM A NUMBER OF TIMES, THERE'S

1812
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
SO MUCH INFORMATION THAT POLICE

1813
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
ARE TRYING TO GET.

1814
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
SOME OF THE EYEWITNESSS TEND TO

1815
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
HAVE WRONG INFORMATION.

1816
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
THEY GET INITIAL INFORMATION

1817
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
FROM THE CRIME SCENE, FROM THE

1818
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
PERSON'S BODY SOMETIME.

1819
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
THAT INFORMATION IS SOMETIMES

1820
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
CONFUSING.

1821
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
SO, AGAIN, RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE

1822
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
SIMPLY TRYING TO ASSESS THE

1823
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
DAMAGE.
THEY NOW KNOW THE NUMBER OF

1824
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
DEAD.
THEY'VE REMOVED ALL THE PEOPLE

1825
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
FROM THE SCENE WHO WERE INJURED.

1826
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
NOW THE DIFFICULT WORK OF WHY?

1827
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

1828
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
IS BEGINNING TO TAKE PLACE.

1829
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
>> PIERRE, DO WE HAVE ANY UPDATE

1830
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
ON THE TIMELINE FOR THE PARENTS

1831
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
WHO ARE STILL WAITING FOR

1832
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
CONFIRMATION?

1833
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
HOURS HAVE GONE BY AND MANY KNOW

1834
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
THE INEVITABLE, BUT DO WE KNOW

1835
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
HOW THIS WILL PLAY OUT?

1836
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THIS

1837
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
DAY?
>> WE KNOW THE GOVERNOR, AS YOU

1838
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
REPORTED EARLIER, SPOKE TO SOME

1839
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
OF THE PARENTS.

1840
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW THE

1841
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT WHAT WAS

1842
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
SAID ABOUT EACH CHILD WHICH IS

1843
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
THE MOST DIFFICULT PART.

1844
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
>> PIERRE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1845
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
YOUR HARD WORK IN OUR WASHINGTON

1846
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
BUREAU TODAY.

1847
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
SO HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW.

1848
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
REPORTING IN JUST NOW, PIERRE

1849
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
THOMAS, THE SUSPECT IS BELIEVED

1850
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
AT THIS HOUR TO BE ADAM LANZA.

1851
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
HE'S 20 YEARS OLD.

1852
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
ONE OF THE VICTIMS, HIS MOTHER,

1853
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER, AND MANY

1854
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
OF THE CHILDREN INSIDE HER

1855
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
CLASSROOM.
IN FACT, WE DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF

1856
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
THE CHILDREN SURVIVED IN THAT

1857
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
KINDERGARTEN CLASS.

1858
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
AND SO THE NUMBERS ARE AS

1859
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
FOLLOW.
18 CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL.

1860
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
TWO CHILDREN HAVE BEEN SHOT.

1861
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
THEY RUSHED THEM TO THE

1862
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
HOSPITAL.
THAT WAS THE DANBURY HOSPITAL

1863
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
WHERE THEY HAD SET UP A TRIAGE

1864
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
AND THE TWO CHILDREN DID NOT

1865
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
SURVIVE THERE.

1866
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
SO 20 CHILDREN IN ALL, 6 ADULTS.

1867
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
WE BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THOSE

1868
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
ADULTS WERE IN FACT TEACHERS.

1869
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
OBVIOUSLY THE KINDERGARTEN

1870
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
TEACHER, THE MOTHER.

1871
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
WHAT'S NOT KNOWN AT THIS HOUR IS

1872
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
THAT SECOND LOCATION IN NEWTOWN,

1873
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
CONNECTICUT, THE ADDITIONAL

1874
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
ADULT THAT'S ALSO DECEASED.

1875
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
WE DON'T KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP

1876
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
BETWEEN THEM, BUT WE DO KNOW

1877
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
THAT THE SUSPECT, AGAIN, AT THIS

1878
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
HOUR, IS ADAM LANZA, 20 YEARS

1879
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
OLD AND IT'S HIS BROTHER, RYAN,

1880
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
WHO MIGHT BE AT THIS HOUR BEING

1881
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
QUESTIONED.
THAT'S WHAT WE DO NOT KNOW AT

1882
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
THIS POINT.

1883
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
WE CERTAINLY DO NOT KNOW WHO

1884
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
THAT OTHER PERSON IS IN THAT

1885
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
HOUSE WE TALKED TO.

1886
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID TALK

1887
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
ABOUT HERE WITH THE MEDICAL TEAM
IS THE REACTION FROM THE

1888
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
CHILDREN INSIDE THAT SCHOOL, HOW

1889
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
CALM THEY WERE, HOW TERRIFIED

1890
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
THEY WERE BUT HOW CALM THEY WERE

1891
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
IN GETTING OUT OF THAT SCHOOL.

1892
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
THEN THE REACTION FROM OLDER

1893
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
SIBLINGS THAT WERE AT THE MIDDLE

1894
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
SCHOOL, AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND

1895
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
SO WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

1896
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
THEIR YOUNGER SIBLINGS HAD

1897
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
SURVIVED.

1898
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
THERE WAS A 17-YEAR-OLD EARLIER

1899
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
TODAY, HE TALKED WITH OUR

1900
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
AFFILIATE WTNH AND IT WAS A

1901
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
MOMENT THAT I THOUGHT WAS QUITE

1902
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
POWERFUL ABOUT THE WORRY ONE

1903
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
SIBLING HAS FOR ANOTHER,

1904
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE A

1905
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
TEENAGER AND YOU KNOW THE

1906
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
BREADTH OF WHAT'S GOING ON.

1907
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
TAKE A LOOK.

1908
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
>> Reporter: WHAT DID YOUR
SISTER TELL YOU?

1909
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I SAW HER WITH YOU EARLIER.

1910
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
SHE WON'T EVEN LOOK ANYWHERE

1911
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
NEAR THE CAMERA.

1912
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
SHE SEEMS PRETTY HORRIFIED.

1913
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
WAS SHE ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU

1914
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
WHAT SHE WITNESSED?

1915
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
>> WELL, I MEAN, AGAIN, SHE'S

1916
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
VERY TRAUMATIZED.

1917
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
WHEN SHE WALKED OUT OF THE
SCHOOL, SHE WAS CRYING.

1918
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
ALL THE STUDENTS WERE HOLDING

1919
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
HANDS.

1920
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
THE TEACHERS WERE TRAUMATIZED.

1921
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, BASED ON WHAT SHE

1922
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
SAID WAS, AT ABOUT, LIKE, EARLY

1923
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
IN THE MORNING, THERE WAS -- SHE

1924
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
HEARD, LIKE, THE INTERCOM CAME

1925
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
ON THE SCHOOL AND SHE HEARD A

1926
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
SCREAM AND SHE HEARD A GUNSHOT

1927
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
OR TWO GUNSHOTS.

1928
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
AND THEN THE SCHOOL WENT INTO

1929
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
LOCKDOWN.

1930
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
AND WHEN THEY HID IN THE CLOSET.

1931
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
SHE WAS IN ART CLASS AND THEY

1932
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
HAD TO HIDE IN THE CLOSET.

1933
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
THEY WERE QUIET.
THE CHILDREN OBVIOUSLY WERE VERY

1934
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
SHAKEN.
THEY WERE CRYING IN THE CLOSET.

1935
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
AND THE CLOSET OF THE ART ROOM.

1936
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
AND EVENTUALLY, YOU KNOW, THEY

1937
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
WERE LEAVING AND WHEN THEY WERE

1938
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
LEAVING, THE POLICE MADE THEM

1939
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
HOLD HANDS AND THE POLICE TOLD

1940
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
THEM TO CLOSE THEIR EYES.

1941
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
>> THE 17-YEAR-OLD WHO TALKED

1942
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
ABOUT HIS REACTION WHEN HE FOUND

1943
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
OUT HIS YOUNGER SISTER IN THE

1944
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
FOURTH GRADE, HIS LITTLE SISTER,

1945
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
WAS OKAY.
WE WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO

1946
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
IMAGES THAT ARE JUST COMING IN

1947
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
NOW AS THE SCENE CONTINUES TO

1948
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
UNFOLD.
AS WE LOOK AT THEM, I WANTED TO

1949
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
BRING IN JEN ASHTON FROM OUR

1950
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
MEDICAL TEAM.

1951
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A

1952
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
17-YEAR-OLD BOY, THIS IS A

1953
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
TEENAGER.

1954
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
WE KNOW WHAT YOUNGER SIBLINGS

1955
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
ARE LIKE, IN THE MAKEUP OF A

1956
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
HOUSEHOLD.
BOY, DO YOU SEE THE TRUE COLORS

1957
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
OF A LOVE BETWEEN TWO SIBLINGS

1958
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS

1959
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
AND HOW WORRIED AND DEVASTATED

1960
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
HE WAS AT THE NOTION, THE

1961
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
THOUGHT HE MIGHT NOT SEE HER.

1962
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1963
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
AND I THINK A LOT OF THAT HAS TO

1964
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
DO WITH WHAT WE KNOW AS WE GET

1965
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
OLDER.
WE CAN THEORIZE OR GUESS AND

1966
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
IMAGINE WHAT THAT 5-YEAR-OLD OR

1967
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
6-YEAR-OLD OR 7-YEAR-OLD HAS

1968
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
JUST SEEN, HEARD, FELT.

1969
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
AND THAT IN AND OF ITSELF IS

1970
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
MIND-BOGGLING FOR AN ADULT OR

1971
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
LATE ADOLESCENT.

1972
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THOSE

1973
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
CHILDREN, WE USED TO REMEMBER

1974
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
DEVELOPMENTALLY THEY'RE AT A

1975
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
STAGE RIGHT NOW WHERE THEY'RE

1976
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
VERY VULNERABLE.
>> THANK YOU, JEN.

1977
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
WE WANT TO GO BACK TO

1978
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
CONNECTICUT NOW.
>> I TOLD YOU THE NUMBER OF

1979
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
DECEASED IN THE BUILDING AT THE

1980
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
HOSPITAL, AND AT THE SECONDARY

1981
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
CRIME SCENE.
IT'S OUR POLICY AND PROTOCOL

1982
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
THAT WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH

1983
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THOSE

1984
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
VICTIMS.

1985
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
THAT IS A TIME CONSUMING

1986
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
PROCESS.

1987
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO

1988
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
TAKE A GREAT DEAL OF TIME.

1989
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER HAS ALREADY

1990
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
ARRIVED ON THE SCENE.

1991
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
HE'S GOING TO WORK VERY CLOSELY

1992
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
WITH US TO EXPEDITE THAT, GET

1993
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
THAT DONE AS EFFICIENTLY AS

1994
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
POSSIBLE.

1995
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
AS I TOLD YOU, THE FAMILIES HAVE

1996
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
BEEN ASSIGNED A TROOPER, AN

1997
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
OFFICER, AS A LINE OF

1998
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
COMMUNICATION.
BUT THAT WAS DONE SPECIFICALLY

1999
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
TO ENSURE THE FAMILIES THAT THEY

2000
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
HAVE CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH

2001
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
THIS ONGOING INVESTIGATION AND

2002
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
THEY WON'T HAVE TO SIT AND WATCH

2003
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
TELEVISION NEWS OR ANYTHING

2004
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
ELSE.

2005
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
THEY WILL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW

2006
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
ANY OF THE PROGRESS THAT'S MADE

2007
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
AS THIS INVESTIGATION CONTINUES

2008
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
ON.
AS I STATED EARLIER, THE ASSETS

2009
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
THAT WERE UTILIZED INITIALLY

2010
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
WERE CERTAINLY WHEN THE CALL

2011
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
CAME IN, NEWTOWN POLICE

2012
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
DEPARTMENT IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED

2013
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
AND IMMEDIATELY CALLED FOR HELP.

2014
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
SURROUNDING LOCAL AGENCIES SENT

2015
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
OFFICERS AND THE CONNECTICUT

2016
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
STATE POLICE SENT ALL OFF DUTY

2017
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
AND ON-DUTY TROOPERS TO RESPOND

2018
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
SO THEY COULD IMMEDIATELY GAIN

2019
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
ACCESS TO THAT BUILDING AND

2020
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
BEGIN THAT SEARCH PROCESS THAT I

2021
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
ALLUDED TO BEFORE.

2022
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
WE HAD THE STATE POLICE TEAM, WE

2023
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
HAD K-9 TEAMS OUT HERE.

2024
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
WE CERTAINLY HAD TROOPER 1 IN

2025
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
THE AIR.

2026
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
IT WAS PROBABLY TO KEEP SOME OF

2027
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
YOUR HELICOPTERS AWAY, QUITE

2028
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
FRANKLY.
BUT WE HAD EVERY POSSIBLE ASSET.

2029
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
CAME OUT TO THIS SCENE THE

2030
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
MINUTE THAT THIS ALARM CAME IN

2031
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
OR THIS CALL CAME IN AND IT WAS

2032
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
CERTAINLY TO DO EVERYTHING WE

2033
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
COULD TO PROTECT CERTAINLY LIFE
AND PROPERTY.

2034
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN

2035
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
OUTSTANDING IN SUPPORTING THIS

2036
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
EFFORT.

2037
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
AS YOU CAN SEE, YOU'VE TAKEN

2038
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
OVER THEIR PARK AND THEY'RE

2039
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
SHOWING UP.

2040
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
THEY'RE OFFERING CONDOLENCES.

2041
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY

2042
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000

00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
VICTIMS, THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES

2044
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
OF THIS HORRIFIC TRAGEDY.

2045
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
THE FBI CRISIS MANAGEMENT TEAM

2046
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000

2054
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
VERY HORRIFIC AND DIFFICULT

2055
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
SCENE.

2056
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
CERTAINLY LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH

2057
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
CRISIS INTERVENTION TEAMS HAD

2058
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
BEEN ON SCENE AND HAVE BEEN HERE

2059
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000

2060
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
ASSISTING AND HELPING.

2061
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT VERY

2062
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
CLEAR THAT THERE WERE 18

2063
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
CHILDREN WHO WERE PRONOUNCED

2064
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
DEAD AT THE SCENE.

2065
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
THERE WERE TWO CHILDREN

2066
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
TRANSPORTED TO AREA HOSPITAL

2067
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE HOSPITAL.

2068
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
THERE WERE SIX ADULTS THAT WERE

2069
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE.

2070
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
AND OBVIOUSLY THE SHOOTER WAS

2071
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
ALSO PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE

2072
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
SCENE.
I DON'T HAVE MUCH MORE DETAIL

2073
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
ABOUT THAT SECONDARY SCENE, BUT

2074
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
THERE IS A RELATED SCENE THAT WE

2075
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
DISCOVERED AS WE WERE CONTINUING

2076
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND

2077
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
SPECIFICALLY INVESTIGATING THE

2078
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
SHOOTER.
AND YOU PROBABLY SAW AND SOMEONE

2079
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
ASKED ME ON THE WAY IN HERE

2080
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
ABOUT THE BOMB SQUAD AND, YES,

2081
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
WE BROUGHT ALL OUR ASSETS IN IN

2082
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
CASE THEY WERE NEEDED AND WHEN

2083
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
WE WENT OUT WITH NEWTOWN

2084
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
OFFICERS TO SEARCH OR TO EXECUTE

2085
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
SEARCH WARRANTS, OR TO EXAMINE

2086
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
OTHER POSSIBLE SECONDARY SCENES,

2087
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
WE TOOK ALL THOSE ASSETS WITH US

2088
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE RIGHT

2089
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
THERE IMMEDIATELY SO WE COULD

2090
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
REACT IF IT WAS NECESSARY.

2091
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
THAT'S ABOUT ALL I HAVE AS FAR

2092
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
AS THE DETAILS ARE CONCERNED.

2093
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE MORE

2094
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000

TELL YOU THERE ARE CERTAIN

2100
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
THINGS WE CANNOT DISCUSS AT THIS

2101
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
TIME.
I'LL TAKE IT RIGHT HERE.

2102
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
[ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ]

2103
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
>> THAT WAS ONE PERSON WHO WAS

2104
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
INJURED WHO SUFFERED AN SWRUR
AND DID SURVIVE, YES.

2105
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T CONFIRM.

2106
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I KNOW ABOUT THE SECONDARY

2107
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
SCENE.
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET INTO

2108
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
DETAIL ABOUT THAT.

2109
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I'LL TRY TO THAT FOR 6:00.

2110
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
>> THE SHOOTER'S IDENTITY, ADAM

2111

>> NOT GOING TO CONFIRM THE

2113
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000

WE'RE NOT PREPARED TO DO THAT.

00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
WE HAVE A TENTATIVE

2115
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000

WE'RE WORKING WITH THAT.

2116
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONFIRM THE

2117
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000

00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
FOR OUR INVESTIGATE PURPOSES

2121
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO DO THAT

2122
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
RIGHT NOW.

2123
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
