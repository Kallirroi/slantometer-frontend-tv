BE A LITTLE BIGGER

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
THAN SOME OF OURS.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
THAT'S PRETTY TRUE.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I WORK WITH
SIZABLE BUDGETS.

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
ANYWHERE FROM SEVEN

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
THOUSAND TO TEN
THOUSAND AS A BASE.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
AND GO FROM THERE.

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
HOLY MOLY YEAH I

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
DEFIANTLY DON'T HAVE

BUT DESIGNER DWIGHT
TELLS ME WE CAN PULL

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
FOR A FRACTION OF THE COST.

YOU NEVER HAVE TO SACRIFICE

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
HIGH STYLE AND SOPHISTICATION
FOR AFFORDABILITY.

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
YOU HAVE ON HAND AND
A LITTLE PLANNING YOU CAN

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
ABSOLUTELY RECREATE THIS
FOR ALL YOUR DINNER GUEST.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
THE FIRST PLACE TO SAVE

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
TONS THAT TABLE CLOTH.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
IT'S ACTUALLY A BED SHEET.

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
AND I TELL PEOPLE IF YOU
DON'T HAVE FINE IMPORTED

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
LINENS ITS NO BIG DEAL.

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
YOU CAN TAKE A BED SHEET,
AND I'VE USED IT MANY

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
TIMES, AND NO ONE EVER KNOWS.

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
THIS IS KEY.

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH A

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
BED SHEET THAT HAS A LOW

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
THREAD COUNT BY LAYING

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
FELT ON THE TABLE FIRST IT

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
WILL IMPROVE THE WAY THE SHEET

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
DRAPES AND HANGS ON THE TABLE.

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
WHERE DO YOU GET FELT?

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
ANY FABRIC STORE
WILL HAVE IT.

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
THIS RAN ME MAYBE FOUR OR

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THREE DOLLARS A YARD, AND WE'RE
WORKING WITH THREE YARDS HERE.

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
HE DRESSES THE BED

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
SHEET WITH THE OVERLAY.

63
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
WHAT IS THIS?
ITS ALMOST LIKE A CORSET.

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
THAT'S INTERESTING YOU
PICKED UP ON THAT.

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
THAT'S THE INSPIRATION

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
BEHIND THIS OVERLAY.

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I LIKE USING VELUM

68
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
BECAUSE THE TRANSPARENCY
THAT IT HAS.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
OR WANT TO BUY IT YOU CAN
ACHIEVE THE LOOK WITH

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
PLAIN OLD PRINTER PAPER.

72
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
YOU'VE GOT TO START

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
WITH A TEMPLATE FIRST.

74
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
THIS IS WHAT I MADE

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
FOR THIS TABLE.

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
THIS IS PRETTY EXTENSIVE.

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I DO HAVE AN ARCHITECTURAL
BACKGROUND THAT MIGHT BE WHY IT

78
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
LOOKS MORE TECHNICAL THAN IT IS.

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
YOU DECIDE HOW MANY

80
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
PANELS YOU WANT THE
OVERLAY TO HAVE.

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
THEN YOUR IN WORK ON EACH SIDE,

82
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THAT TELLS ME WHAT SIZE EACH

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
VELUM PANEL NEEDS TO BE.

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
PUNCH WHOLES IN TO LACE

85
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
THE RIBBON THROUGH, ITS

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
IMPORTANT YOU START WITH

87
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
THE CORNERS BECAUSE

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
IT LACES TOGETHER.

89
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
AND ONCE YOU GET THAT DONE

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
YOU DECIDE HOW FAR YOU WANT

91
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
THE WHOLE TO BE SPACED APART.

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I USUALLY DO ABOUT
TWO INCHES TWO AND

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
A HALF INCHES APART.

94
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
ONCE YOU GET THE HOLES

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
IN YOU STRING THE RIBBON.

96
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
ACTUALLY WE SHOULD
HAVE GONE UNDER.

97
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
BECAUSE YOU WANT THE

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
XS TO STAY ON TOP.

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
THIS IS WHY I'M HERE.

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
SO I CAN MAKE

101
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
ALL THE MISTAKES AND
YOU DON'T MAKE THEM.

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THEN WE LACE UNDER.

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
OH.

104
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
DWIGHT ADVICES DO

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
NOT DO THIS THE SAME
DAY AS THE PARTY.

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I DON'T WANT TO RECEIVE

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
ANY EMAILS SAYING WAIT A
MINUTE THIS IS NOT, YOU

108
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
MADE IT LOOK A LOT EASIER.

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF

110
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
YOUR TABLE IT CAN TAKE A
COUPLE DAYS TO DO.

111
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
THESE GLASSES.

112
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
THESE ARE JUST JUICE
GLASSES THAT I HAD AROUND

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
THE HOUSE AND I TOOK THEM

114
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
AND I'M GOING TO USE THEM

115
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
AS RISERS, AND I FILLED THEM

116
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
FIRST WITH DRIED SPLIT PEAS.

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
HOW COOL.

118
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
KIND OF COOL YEAH.

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
HE USES RECYCLED GLASS
FROM AN OLD PIECE OF

120
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
FURNITURE AS A RISER IN

121
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE.

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
SMELLS GREAT DOESN'T IT.

123
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
AND FILLED THEM

124
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
WITH COFFEE BEANS.

125
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
AND LOOK AT THIS, HE
ADDS A BRANCH AS PART

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
OF THE CENTERPIECE.

127
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
HE GAVE IT A GOOD CLEANING

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
WITH BLEACH AND WATER YOU

129
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
WOULDN'T WANT UNINVITED

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
GUEST SHOWING
UP AT THE PARTY.

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
WHEN ITS DRIED WE ADD SOME
GOLD WIRE BEADS AND MOSS

132
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
AROUND IT TO DRESS IT UP A BIT.

133
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
BUT ITS JUST THAT SIMPLE.

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
ITS ALL ABOUT USING

135
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
WHAT YOU HAVE AT HAND.

136
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
THIS IS JUST AS YOU CAN
SEE A CABBAGE HEAD, I WILL

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
TURN ANYTHING INTO A VASE.

138
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
YOU KNOW.

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
SO I CARVED IT OUT AND BY

140
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
TAKING LIKE FOAM OASIS
THAT'S BEEN SOAKED IN WATER

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
WE CAN INSERT IT IN THERE.

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
NOW CARVING IT OUT, IS
IT AS SIMPLE AS TAKING

143
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
A KNIFE ON THE INSIDE.

144
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
ITS LIKE A PUMPKIN.

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
IF YOU TAKE IT AND SPRAY
IT WITH WATER AND PUT IT

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
IN A PLASTIC BAG

147
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
AND IN YOUR CRISPER FOR A COUPLE

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
DAYS IT WILL HARDEN AND
STAY THIS WAY THAT'S HOW

149
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
ITS ABLE TO SIT OUT ON THE
TABLE DURING THE DINNER

150
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
PARTY AND NOT WILT.

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
THAT'S THE KEY
RIGHT THERE.

152
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THAT'S THE KEY.

153
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I KNEW THERE HAD
TO BE SOMETHING.

154
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
OKAY COOL.

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
INEXPENSIVE
SUPERMARKET ROSES.

156
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
THESE ARE SPRAY ROSES,

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I TAKE THEM AND START
INSERTING THEM INTO OUR OASIS.

158
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
WE ADD GOURDS,

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
MOSS AND PLACEMATS.

160
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
IT WAS A LONG TWIG RUNNER

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
THAT I TOOK AND JUST CUT UP
INTO PARTS AND MADE

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
OUR PLACEMATS WITH WHITE CHINA

163
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST WAY

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
TO STRETCH A DOLLAR.

165
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
YOU CAN USE THIS OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
ENDLESS THEMES,
COLOR COMBINATIONS.

167
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
THERE IS ONLY ONE PLACE

168
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
SETTING IN THIS DESIGN AND
ONE IN THAT BUT IF YOU SEE

169
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
IF YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER.

170
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
YEAH THEY COMPLIMENT
EACH OTHER.

171
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'M ALL ABOUT MIXING AND
MATCHING SO BELIEVE IT OR

172
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
NOT FOR 18 DOLLARS WE HAVE

173
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
A PLACE SETTING

174
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
FOR 6 PEOPLE.

175
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I LOVE IT.

176
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
AND LOOK AT THESE
CUTE NAME HOLDERS.

177
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
SOME GHOST PUMPKINS, AND VELUM

178
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
AND I WROTE NAMES ON IT AND
USE THIS TO SECURE IT ON HERE.

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
AND THERE IS ONE FOR ME.

180
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
ABSENTLY A PLACE

181
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
HERE FOR YOU KAT.

182
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
PUT ONE CENTER
ON EACH DISH.

183
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
A FEW FLAMELESS CANDLES TO SET

184
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
AFTER YOU PICK YOUR BASKET

353
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
OR YOUR CONTAINER IS TO

354
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
GET SOME GROCERY

355
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
NICE AND FLAT AND THEN CRUSH IT,

360
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000

STABILIZED INSIDE THE
BASKET OR CONTAINER

364
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
SO NOTHING FALLS.

365
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
ONCE YOU HAVE PAPER

366
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
BAGS INSIDE TO
STABILIZE ANYTHING.

367
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
THE NEXT STEP
IS SHRED ON TOP.

368
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
THAT WILL HIDE GROCERY

369
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
STORE BAGS ON THE
BOTTOM OF THE BASKET.

370
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
THEN ADD THE GOODIES.

371
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
SHIRLEY HAS A TIP TO

372
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
KEEP EVERYTHING UPRIGHT.

373
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
OTHER THAN USING THE PAPER
WHICH IS THE BASE FOR

374
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
MAKING YOUR GIFT BASKET

375
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
KEEP ITEM UPRIGHT IN OTHER

376
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
WAYS, YOU CAN USE SKEWERS,

377
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
YES I'M TALKING

378
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
ABOUT THE BBQ SKEWERS

379
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
WE USE EVERY SUMMER.

380
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
YOU WILL BREAK THE SKEWERS

381
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
INTO THREE INCH PIECES,

382
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
AND THEN ATTACH THE

383
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
SKEWERS ON THE BACK
OF CERTAIN ITEMS.

384
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
YOU JUST ATTACH THE

385
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
SKEWER WITH TAPE.

386
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
USE SCISSORS TO JUST PUNCH

387
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
A WHOLE IN THE PAPER AND

388
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
BRING THE SKEWER DOWN

389
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
INTO THE PAPER UNTIL ALL
THE ITEMS STAY UPRIGHT.

390
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
THAT'S BECAUSE A HEAVY
ITEM LIKE A BOTTLE OF

391
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
CIDER OR SOMETHING ELSE

392
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
THAT'S HEAVY NEEDS THE
STABILIZATION OF A SKEWER

393
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
BUT THE ITEMS AROUND IT,

394
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
MAYBE CHIPS, MAYBE DIP,

395
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE
LIGHT, AND THAT'S GOING TO

396
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
ACTUALLY JUST SIT ON THE SIDE OF

397
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
THE HEAVY ITEM SO THAT THOSE

398
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
ITEMS STAY UPRIGHT AS WELL.

399
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
FILL THE BASKET WITH GOODIES YOU

400
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
KNOW THE RECIPIENT WILL LOVE IS

401
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
THE BEST PART AND THE MOST FUNT

402
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
THINK ABOUT THE PERSON RECEIVING

403
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
THE GIFT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO
AMAZE AND DAZZLE THEM.

404
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
ALSO THINK ABOUT THE
ENHANCEMENTS THAT YOU ADD.

405
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
AFTER YOU PUT YOUR GIFT
BASKET TOGETHER AND ITS

406
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
LOOKING BOUNTIFUL AND DAZZLING,

407
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
NOW YOU'RE
GOING TO CLOSE IT.

408
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
SO I'M GOING TO NEED THE
TAPE, THE SCISSORS, AND

409
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
THE CELLOPHANE AND THE BOW.

410
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE

411
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
MOST POPULAR ITEM TO CLOSE

412
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
A BASKET AND THAT IS CELLOPHANE.

413
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
CELLOPHANE CAN BE PURCHASED
AT MANY, MANY CRAFT STORES,

414
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
YOU WILL TAKE THE CELLOPHANE,

415
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
UNWRAP IT, AND PLACE IT

416
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
UNDERNEATH THE GIFT BASKET AND

417
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
BRING THE CELLOPHANE UP

418
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
IN FRONT AND

419
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
IN BACK OF THE BASKET.

420
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
CLOSE THE CELLOPHANE AND

421
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
THEN CLOSE FROM BACK TO

422
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
FRONT AND FRONT TO BACK.

423
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
THAT IS IT FOR CLOSING.

424
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
ON THE SIDE.

425
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
TAPE DOWN THE BACK ENDS OF

426
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
THE CELLOPHANE SO THEY'RE NOT

427
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
IN THE WAY OF THE APPEARANCE,

428
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
THEN USE A TWIST TIE
TO SECURE THE CELLOPHANE

429
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
AT THE TOP.

430
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
ONE, TWO, THREE.

431
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
NOW ITS TIME FOR THE BOW.

432
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
YOU PROBABLY HAVE BOWS IN

433
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
YOUR HOME ALREADY, SO EVEN
THOUGH YOU HAVE THE OPTION

434
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
OF PICKING A BOW OR TWO UP
FROM A CRAFT STORE, FIRST

435
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
JUST LIKE WITH THE BASKET

436
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
AND THE ITEMS YOU'RE GOING

437
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
TO PUT IN THE GIFT BASKET
LOOK AROUND YOUR HOME.

438
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
YOU PUT THE BOW ON, AND PUT

439
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
THE TWIST TIE BECAUSE YOU NEED
THE TIE FOR YOUR NEXT BASKET.

440
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
NOW YOU CROWN THAT BASKET

441
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL BOW
THAT COMES FROM YOUR HEART

442
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
AND YOUR HOUSE
AT THE SAME TIME.

443
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
AND THAT IS YOUR

444
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
TOTAL GIFT BASKET.

445
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
FROM WHAT WE CALL THE

446
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
BASKET TO THE BOW.

447
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
NOW THERE ARE SOME DOS

448
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
AND DON'TS WHEN IT COMES

449
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
TO MAKING A GIFT BASKET.

450
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
ONE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOU DO NOT PLACE CHOCOLATE

451
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
ITEMS AND FRAGRANT CANDLES

452
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
OR FRAGRANT SOAPS TOGETHER.

453
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
YOU WANT THE PERSON WHOSE
RECEIVING THE BASKET TO GET

454
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
EVERYTHING AND TO ENJOY

455
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
EVERYTHING IN THE BASKET.

456
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW OF ANY

457
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
ALLERGIC REACTION TO ANY NUT
ITEMS, AND PASTA ITEMS,

458
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

459
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
ANOTHER THING ABOUT GIFT
BASKETS THAT IS A DON'T IS

460
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
CUTTING YOUR CELLOPHANE

461
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
A LITTLE TOO SHORT.

462
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU'RE

463
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
NOT SURE HOW TALL A PIECE
OF CELLOPHANE SHOULD BE

464
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
OR HOW BIG YOU SHOULD CUT
YOUR CELLOPHANE SOMETIMES

465
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
YOU DON'T HAVE A BIG ENOUGH FAN

466
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
ON THE GIFT BASKET

467
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
AND IT COULD BE STUBBY
RIGHT AT THE TOP,

468
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
SO MAKE SURE YOUR CUT

469
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
IT AS TALL AS POSSIBLE.

THAT'S NEXT ON DEALS.

481
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
THERE ARE SO MANY MISCONCEPTIONS
ABOUT WHAT'S CONSIDERED HEALTHY

482
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
AND WHAT'S NOT.

483
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
AND WHILE MANY OF YOU

484
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
MIGHT SHY FROM CANNED OR
FROZEN FOODS, IT ACTUALLY

485
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
MIGHT BE A GOOD OPTION

486
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO SAVE SOME MONEY.

487
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
WHEN IT COMES TO STRETCHING

488
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
A MEAL, CYNTHIA WILLIAMS
IS PINCHING PENNIES,

489
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
BUT WILLIAMS IS

490
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
NOT CHOOSING JUNK FOOD,
SHE WANTS TO FEED HER FAMILY

491
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
HEALTHY MEALS, THAT'S WHY

492
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
SHE HAS CANNED AND FROZEN
VEGETABLES IN HER CART.

493
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
A MOVE THAT DIETICIAN

494
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
PENNY WILSON SAYS IS SMART.

495
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
YOU CAN SAVE MONEY AND EAT

496
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
WELL AT THE SAME TIME.

497
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
TIP NUMBER ONE.

498
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
TO SAVE ON FOOD, CHOOSE
FROZEN OVER FRESH, ITS

499
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
USUALLY CHEAPER.

500
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
BECAUSE THE FROZEN VEGETABLES

501
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
ARE PICKED AT THE PEAK OF
RIPENESS AND FROZEN RIGHT THEN.

502
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE BROCCOLI,
WE FOUND IT FOR 2.18 FRESH,

503
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
BUT IN THE FROZEN FOOD SECTION

504
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
BROCCOLI CUTS COST $1 A BAG

505
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
FOR ABOUT THE SAME SIZE
AS THE FRESH BUNCH.

506
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
AND YOU DON'T HAVE

507
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
TO WORRY ABOUT
THEM GOING BAD.

508
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
TIP NUMBER TWO GO
FOR CANNED VEGGIES.

509
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
WE GREW UP ON CANNED

510
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
VEGETABLES, THAT'S ALL
WE HAD IN MY HOUSE.

511
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
WILSON SAYS WHILE FRESH
PRODUCE IS ALWAYS A GREAT OPTION

512
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
SHE SAYS CANNED VEGETABLES

513
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
ARE A GOOD SUBSTITUTE.

514
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
JUST READ THE LABELS.

515
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
STILL 10% ONE THING YOU WANT TO

516
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
LOOK FOR IS IF YOU CAN GET

517
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
THE ONES WITH NO ADDED SALT.

518
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
BECAUSE THEY DO TEND

519
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
TO ADD SALT INTO
CANNED VEGETABLES.

520
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
TIP NUMBER THREE BEANS

521
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
ARE A SUPER FOOD.

522
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T
REALIZE BEANS ARE A GOOD

523
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
SOURCE OF PROTEIN AND FIBER.

524
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
SHE SAYS CANNED BEANS ARE
A GREAT OPTION BUT TO SAVE EVEN

525
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
MORE PICK UP SOME DRIED BEANS.

526
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
YEAH, YOU'RE GOING TO GET

MORE OVERALL WITH THAT.

528
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000

1.29 VS 4.69 FOR A POUND AND
A HALF WE FOUND ON THE SHELF.
