00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
JEFF: HEN, AND WEL'M
JEFF CORWIN, AND WELCOME

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
TO OCEAN MYSTERIES.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
THIS RATHER

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
OMINOUS-LOOKING GRIN

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
BELONGS TO NONE OTHER

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
THAN THE MYSTERIOUS WOLF
EEL.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
IT'S A CREATURE THAT

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
THRIVES IN DEEP, COLD

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
WATERS OFF OF PLACES

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
LIKE ALASKA.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
AND THIS MIGHTY WOLF EEL

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
IS A LITTLE TEASER TO

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
THE ADVENTURE TO COME,

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
BECAUSE TODAY WE'RE

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
HEADING TO THE COASTLINE

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
OF ALASKA, WHERE WE'LL

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
BE A PART OF AN

18
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
INCREDIBLE RESEARCH AND

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
CONSERVATION PROJECT.

20
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
THIS, MY FRIENDS, IS AN

21
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
ADVENTURE YOU DON'T WANT

22
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
TO MISS.
ALASKA IS OVER 4,000

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
MILES FROM GEORGIA

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
AQUARIUM, BUT CERTAINLY

25
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
WORTH THE TRIP.

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
ALASKA IS OUR COUNTRY'S

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
LARGEST STATE, TWICE THE

28
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
SIZE OF TEXAS.

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
100,000 GLACIERS, HALF

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
OF ALL GLACIERS ON OUR

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
PLANET, AND ITS

32
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
COASTLINE STRETCHES FOR

33
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
NEARLY 34,000 MILES.

34
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
BUT FOR ME, THE MOST

35
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
INCREDIBLE FEATURE OF

36
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
ALASKA IS ITS WILDLIFE,

37
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
AND TODAY WE ARE HERE TO

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
STUDY ONE OF NORTH

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
AMERICA'S LARGEST MARINE

40
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
MAMMALS, THE MIGHTY

41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
STELLER SEA LION.

42
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
UNFORTUNATELY, IN RECENT

43
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
YEARS, LARGE PORTIONS OF

44
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
THE STELLER SEA LION

45
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
POPULATION HERE HAVE

46
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
DECLINED DRAMATICALLY.

47
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
SOME OF ALASKA'S STELLER

48
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
SEA LIONS ARE NOW LISTED

49
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
AS ENDANGERED, WITH 80%

50
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
DECLINED OVER JUST THE

51
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
LAST THREE DECADES.

52
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
TODAY, SCIENTISTS ARE

53
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
RACING TO DETERMINE WHY

54
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
THIS SPECIES CONTINUES

55
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
TO BE IN TROUBLE.

56
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, AS YOU

57
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
CAN SEE, IT IS A CRISP

58
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
AND SOMEWHAT GRAY DAY

59
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
HERE OFF OF SEWARD, BUT

60
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
THINGS ARE GOING TO PICK

61
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
UP, BECAUSE WE'RE

62
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
ISLAND WITH A TEAM FROMOROM

63
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000

CENTER T

65
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
SEA LIONS.

66
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
YOU GUYS READY?

67
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
MAN: WE'RE READY.
JEFF: ALL RIGHT, LET'S
DO IT.

68
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
TO HELP GATHER

69
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
INFORMATION, THE ALASKA

70
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
SEALIFE CENTER USES A

71
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
NETWORK OF REMOTE VIDEO

72
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
CAMERAS THAT CAPTURE SEA

73
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
LION BEHAVIOR WITHIN

74
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND AND

75
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
RESURRECTION BAY.

76
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
FOR YEARS, THESE CAMERAS

77
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
HAVE PROVIDED VITAL

78
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THESE

79
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
CREATURES, BUT THIS

80
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
MORNING ONE OF THE VIDEO

81
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
FEEDS LOCATED ABOVE

82
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
GROTTO ISLAND HAS GONE

83
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
OFFLINE, SO WE'RE

84
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
HEADING OU
OUT

85
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
WHY AND TO SEE IF WE CAN

86
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
FIX IT.

87
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
WE ARE HERE AT THIS

88
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
REMOTE ISLAND WITH JOHN

89
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
MANISCALCO, WHO WORKS

90
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
WITH THE ALASKA SEALIFE

91
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
CENTER, AND WE'RE GOING

92
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
TO HAVE A MISSION AHEAD

93
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
OF US.
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

94
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
JOHN: WELL, WE'RE GOING

95
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
TO GET OFF THE BOAT

96
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
HERE, HIKE UP THESETOCKS, AO

97
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
THAT CAMERA AND FIX IT,

98
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
IF WE CAN.

99
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
GROTTO ISLAND IS A

100
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
FAVORITE SPOT FOR MANY

101
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
OF THESE STELLER SEA

102
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
LIONS AND BIRDS ALIKE.

103
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
THIS BROKEN VIDEO CAMERA

104
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
IS PERCHED HIGH ABOVE US

105
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
WITH A FANTASTIC VIEW OF

106
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
THE COVE AND ROCKS

107
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
BELOW.

108
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
ALL RIGHT, SO HOW DO WE

109
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
DO THIS?
JOHN: THERE'S SOME

110
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
CRACKS UP TOP.

111
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
JEFF: OKAY.
JOHN: AND I PUT MY HAND

112
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
IN THOSE CRACKS, PUT MY

113
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
RIGHT FOOT ON THIS, AND

114
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
HOIST MYSELF ON UP.

115
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
JEFF: ALL RIGHT, LET'S

116
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
JOHN: ALL RIGHT.

117
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
JEFF: WHAT A SPECTACULAR

118
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
SPOT.

119
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
LOOK AT THIS.

120
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
WE HAVE

121
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
ERUPTIONS OF GRANITE

122
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
THAT JUST STABBED THEIR

123
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
WAY UP INTO THIS

124
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
POSTCARD-PERFECT BLUESKY.

125
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
SKY.

126
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
OCCASIONALLY, WE'RE DIVE

127
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
BOMBED BY THESE

128
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
GREGARIOUS BIRDS.

129
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THEY'RE GLAUCOUS-WINGED

130
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
GULLS, CORRECT?

131
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
JOHN: THAT'S RIGHT.

132
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
JEFF: AND THIS IS THE

133
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
NESTING PERIOD, AND

134
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE WE

135
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
COME ACROSS THESE LITTLE

136
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
GEMS, THESE TRUE NATURAL

137
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
TREASURES.
IF YOU LOOK RIGHT HERE,

138
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
THIS NEST OF THREE EGGS

139
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
IS PERHAPS JUST A WEEK

140
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
OR SO AWAY FROM

141
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
HATCHING, BUT WE'RE HERE

142
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
FOR WHAT'S ABOVE JOHN'S

143
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
HEAD.

144
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT

145
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
OF TECHNOLOGY THERE.

146
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
AND THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY
GREAT WITH JOHN'S

147
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
PROJECT IS HE CAN WORK

148
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
IN HIS OFFICE ON THE

149
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
MOST MISERABLE ALASKAN

150
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
DAY AND JUST FLIP ON HIS

151
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
MONITOR, HIS COMPUTER, SCRE,

152
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
AND ACTUALLY GET A FLY

153
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
ON THE WALL VIEW OF LIFE

154
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
AS IT UNFOLDS HERE ON

155
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
GROTTO ISLAND.

156
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
WHILE JOHN WORKS ON

157
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
THIS, I'M GOING TO JUST

158
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
CAREFULLY CREEP OVER THE

159
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
TOP.

160
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'M JUST GOING TO GO

161
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
THIS WAY, KEEPING A LOW
PROFILE.

162
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'M GOING TO CHECK OUT

163
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THE COLOSSUS BELOW US.

164
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
OH.

165
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
THIS IS REALLY COOL.

166
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
WE HAVE THE ULTIMATE

167
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
BIRD'S EYE VIEW.

168
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
BASICALLY, A HAUL OUT

169
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
SITE IS A LOCATION

170
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
WHERE PINNIPEDS SUCH AS

171
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
CALIFORNIA SEA LIONS,

172
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
AND SEALS, STELLER SEA

173
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
LIONS, THEY PULL

174
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
THEMSELVES OUT OF THE

175
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
COLD WATER THAT THEY

176
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
DEPEND UPON TO TAKE A

177
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
REST.

178
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THE
REMOTE

179
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
REMOTE SLABS OF GRANITE,

180
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
IT PROVIDES THEM WITH A

181
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
PLACE TO SOCIALIZE, TO

182
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
REST, AND WARM UP THEIR

183
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
BODIES.

184
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THEY, OF COURSE, ARE

185
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
ARMED WITH BLUBBER UNDER

186
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
THEIR THICK SKIN TO

187
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
INSULATE THEM.E THERE'S A

188
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
LOT E THERE'S A

189
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
LOT OF REALLY COOL

190
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
SOCIAL DYNAMICS

191
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
UNFOLDING HERE.

192
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000

It just wouldn't go away.

487
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
My doctor diagnosed it
as fibromyalgia,

488
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
thought to be the
result of overactive nerves

489

widespread pain.

to calm these nerves.
