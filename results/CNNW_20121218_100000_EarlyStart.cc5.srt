HUGE MOVEMENT IN THE FISCAL

77

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
LEFT TO GO BEFORE HUGE

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
ACROSS-THE-BOARD TAX HIKES.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
OVERNIGHT WE LEARNED THAT

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE AN

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
EYE-OPENING NEW OFFER IN TALKS

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
WITH HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER.

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
UNDER THIS NEW PROPOSAL, TAX

85
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
RATES WOULD GO UP ON INCOMES

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
ABOVE $400,000.

87
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
FOR YEARS THE PRESIDENT HAS

88
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
CAMPAIGNED THAT THAT NUMBER

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
SHOULD START AT $250,000.

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
HE'S ALSO OFFERING SOME NEW

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
SPENDING CUTS TO GO ALONG WITH

92
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
THIS.

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER'S LATEST

94
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
PROPOSAL CALLED FOR THE TAX

95
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
HIKES TO KICK IN AT $1 MILLION.

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
CNN'S DAN LOTHIAN IS IN

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
WASHINGTON WITH THE LATEST ON

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
THIS.

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
DAN, IT REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
THERE IS SOME MOVEMENT.

101
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
>> IT DOES.

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
THIS MOVEMENT CAME DURING A

103
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
MEETING THE PRESIDENT HAD WITH

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER YESTERDAY

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
THAT MEETING LASTED FOR 45

107
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
MINUTES.
IT WAS THE THIRD TIME THEY HAD

108
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
MET IN THE PAST EIGHT DAYS.

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT IS PRETTY

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
DRAMATIC BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT

111
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
FOR YEARS NOW HAD BEEN HOLDING

112
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
STEADFAST TO THAT $250,000

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THRESHOLD, SAYING THAT THE BUSH

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
ERA TAX CUTS WOULD EXTEND FOR

115
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
THEM BUT NOT THOSE HOUSEHOLDS

116
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
MAKING MORE THAN THAT.

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
NOW HE RAISES IT TO $400,000.

118
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
SO THAT IS SEEN AS A MAJOR

119
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
BREAKTHROUGH.

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
BUT REPUBLICANS, WHILE

121
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
ENCOURAGED BY THESE LATEST

122
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
DEVELOPMENTS, ALSO SAY THAT THE

123
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
MATH REALLY DOESN'T ADD UP.

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
LEANS MORE HEAVILY TOWARDS NEW

126
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
TAXES.
NOW, AS PART OF THAT PROPOSAL

127
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS CUT PUT

128
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
OUT THERE, HE'S CALLING FOR $1.2

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
TRILLION IN NEW REVENUE, $1.22

130
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
TRILLION IN SPENDING CUTS.BUT

131
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
REPUBLICAN AIDES, AGAIN, SAYING

132
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
THAT THE MATH DOESN'T QUITE ADD

133
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
UP BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT THE

134
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX OR THE CPI

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
REALLY INCREASES TAX REVENUE BY

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
$95 BILLION.

137
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
SO WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
ABOUT $1.2 TRILLION, THEY'RE

139
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
SAYING IT'S MORE LIKE $1.3

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
TRILLION.

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
THERE'S STILL DISTANCE THERE

142
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
BETWEEN BOTH SIDES BUT MUCH

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
CLOSER THAN IT WAS A FEW DAYS

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
AGO, JOHN.

145
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
>> DAN, IT DOES SEEM BOTH SIDES

146
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
ARE INDICATING THERE IS MOVEMENT

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
BUT NEITHER SIDE IS WILLING TO

148
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
SAY IT'S A COMPLETE BREAKTHROUGH

149
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
YET.
WITH JUST 14 DAYS TO GO, SHOULD

150
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
WE BE OPTIMISTIC THAT A DEAL

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
WILL BE REACHED?

152
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
>> I CERTAINLY THINK PEOPLE ARE

153
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
OPTIMISTIC.

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
CLEARLY JOHN BOEHNER WILL HAVE

155
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
TO GO BACK TO THE CONSERVATIVES

156
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
IN HIS PARTY WHO HAVE BEEN

157
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
RESISTING ANY MOVEMENT

158
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
WHATSOEVER IN TAXES GOING UP ON

159
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
WEALTHY AMERICANS.

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA ALSO HAS TO

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
SORT OF PROD SOME IN HIS PARTY

162
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
AND THE LAEB UNIONS AND OTHERS

163
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
WHO DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY SEE SO

164
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
FAR.
OVERALL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

165
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
DISTANCE THAT WAS THERE BETWEEN

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
BOTH SIDES, JUST A WEEK AGO,

167
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
THERE IS SOME OPTIMISM THAT THIS

168
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
CAN GET DONE BEFORE THE END OF

169
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
THE YEAR.

170
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
>> DAN LOTHIAN IN WASHINGTON

171
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
THIS MORNING.

172
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
THE HOUSE SPEAKER WILL BE

173
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
MEETING WITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS

174
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
TODAY.
THAT COULD BE AN INTERESTING AND

175
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
CONTENTIOUS MEETING.

176
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
THANKS VERY MUCH, DAN.

177
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
BACK TO ZORAIDA IN NEWTOWN NOW.

178
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
>>> BACK NOW TO THE GUN CONTROL

179
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
DEBATE THAT'S BEEN REIGNITED BY

180
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
THE MASSACRE AT THE SANDY HOOK

181
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
ELEMENTARY RIGHT HERE IN

182
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

183
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
IT SEEMS MORE AND MORE AMERICANS

184
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
ARE MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF

185
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
TIGHTER GUN LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY

186
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
IN THE AFTERMATH OF THAT

187
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
TRAGEDY.

188
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000

189
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000

191
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000

THAT IS ACCORDING TO "THE

193

DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS THAT THIS

205
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
WAS IN NEWTOWN A GAME CHANGER.

206
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE

207
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
POTENTIALLY THE IMPACT OF THESE

208
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
SHIFTING LANDSCAPES, ESPECIALLY

209
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
IN COMMERCIAL WAYS AND POLITICAL

210
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000

WE START WITH COMMERCIALIZED.

THEY'LL REMOVE ALL GUNS FROM THE

217
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000

THE SALE OF SOME SEMIAUTOMATIC

THEY SAY THEY ARE DOING SO OUT

221
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
OF RESPECT FOR THE VICTIMS AND

222
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
FOR THEIR FAMILIES.

223
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
THEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS

224
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
HAPPENING POLITICALLY.

225
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
"THE WASHINGTON POST" IS

SEE CHAUMPG IN THIS.

239
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000

241
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
>> IN THE COMING WEEKS I'LL USE

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
WHATEVER POWER THIS OFFICE HOLDS

248
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
LIKE THIS.

249
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
>> AS WE HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS

250
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
FROM WASHINGTON, THE ONE PLACE

251
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
WE ARE NOT HEARING ANYTHING

252
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
ABOUT IT, ZORAIDA, IS FROM THE

253
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
NRA.
THEY'VE NOT MADE A STATEMENT

254
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
SENSE A WRITTEN STATEMENT ON

255
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
FRIDAY.
THEY'VE SUSPENDED THEIR FACEBOOK

256
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
PAGE AND TWITTER FEED HAS

257
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
REMAINED SILENT.

258
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
ZORAIDA?
>> EMILY, I UNDERSTAND YOU ALSO

259
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
HAVE NEW POLLS TO SHARE WITH US
THIS MORNING.

260
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
>> WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT POLLS

261
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
THAT ARE REALLY SHOWING A

262
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
POTENTIAL SPIKE IN PUBLIC

263
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
OPINION CHANGE ON THIS.
I WANT TO START WITH ONE FROM

264
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
CBS NEWS THAT WAS TAKEN JUST

265
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
OVER THE WEEKEND SAYING DO YOU

266
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
THINK GUN CONTROL RULES SHOULD

267
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
BE MORE STRICT OR LESS STRICT?

268
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT
CHANGE IN THIS.

269
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
SINCE MORE STRICT, 57% SAY THAT

270
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
NOW COMPARED TO 39% BACK IN

271
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
APRIL.

272
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK

273
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
THE GUN CONTROL SHOULD BE LESS

274
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
STRICT HAS DROPPED.

275
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
SIMILAR FINDINGS FROM AN ABC

276
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
NEWS/"WASHINGTON POST" POLL, DO

277
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
YOU SUPPORT OR OPPOSE STRICTER

278
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
GUN CONTROL LAWS?

279
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THAT NUMBER

280
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
HAS GONE UP SINCE AUGUST.

281
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
ONE MORE INTERESTING THING, THE

282
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
PUGH RESEARCH CENTER ASKED

283
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
PEOPLE DO YOU THINK THE

284
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
SHOOTINGS REFLECT A LARGER

285
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
SOCIETAL PROBLEM IN THEIR POLLS

286
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
SAY 47% OF AMERICANS THAT WERE

287
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
POLLED THINK IT DOES.

288
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
CONTRAST THAT TO WHAT HAPPENED

289
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
AFTER THE AURORA SHOOTINGS

290
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
EARLIER THIS YEAR.

291
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
AT THAT TIME, THE NUMBER JUST

292
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
24%.
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THIS

293
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
QUICK SPIKE IN PUBLIC OPINION

294
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
CHANGE WILL REFLENGT ANY

295
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
LEGISLATIVE CHANGES DOWN THE

296
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
LINE.
ZORAIDA?

297
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000

298
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000

THINGS WE HAVE TO DO IS HAVE

357

SOME SORT OF NORMALCY.

358
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000

NONETHELESS, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN

870
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
HERE IS A BIG BREAKTHROUGH

871
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OVER THE

872
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
CAMPAIGN TRAIL YEARS WHEN THE

873
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
PRESIDENT WAS OUT THERE PUSHING

874
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
THIS MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUT TO

875
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
VOTERS, THE PRESIDENT WAS

876
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
INSISTENT THAT HE DID NOT WANT

877
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
TAXES TO GO UP ON THOSE MAKING

878
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
UP TO 250,000 BUT THOSE ABOVE

879
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
THAT, TAXES SHOULD GO UP ON

880
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
THEM, THE BUSH ERA TAX CUTS

881
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
SHOULD EXPIRE FOR THEM.

CEILING TO $400,000.

884
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
SO THAT IS A DRAMATIC

885
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
DEVELOPMENT.

886
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
YOU KNOW, FOR THE MOST PART,

887
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
MUCH OF THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE

888
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
TAKEN PLACE BEHIND THE SCENES.

889
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
AND IN FACT WE OFTEN DON'T FIND

890
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
OUT THAT THE TWO LEADERS HAVE

891
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
SPOKEN EITHER BY PHONE OR FACE

892
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
TO FACE UNTIL AFTER THOSE

893
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
MEETINGS HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

894
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
AND THAT WAS THE CASE YESTERDAY.

895
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
CERTAINLY WE DID NOT FIND OUT

896
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS MEETING

897
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
WITH SPEAKER BOEHNER UNTIL ABOUT

898
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
20 MINUTES OR SO BEFORE THAT

899
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
MEETING WAS OVER.

900
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
THEY MET FOR 45 MINUTES AT THE

901
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
WHITE HOUSE.
THAT WAS THE THIRD TIME THAT

902
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
THEY HAD MET FACE TO FACE OVER

903
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
THE LAST EIGHT DAYS.

904
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
AND SO, AGAIN, IT DOES SHOW THAT

905
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
THEY ARE MAKING SOME BIG

906
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
MOVEMENTS, SOME BIG CONCESSIONS

907
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
HERE.
IT WILL BE INTEREST TO SEE IF IT

908
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
TENS OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

909
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
>> INTERESTING THAT WE'RE SEEING

910
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
SO MANY OF THE NUMBERS FROM

911
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
HOW MUCH HOPE IS THERE THAT

916
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
THEY'LL REACH SOME KIND OF DEAL

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
BEFORE JANUARY 1st?

918
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, THE INTERESTING THING

919
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
IS AS THESE NUMBERS HAVE GONE

920
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
UP, YOU SEE SPEAKER BOEHNER

921
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
TALKING ABOUT RAISING, AS YOU

922
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
POINTED OUT, THE TAXES ON THOSE

923
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
MILLION DOLLAR THRESHOLD, THE

924
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
PRESIDENT 400,000.

925
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
THAT ANGERS THE LEFT OF THE

926
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
PRESIDENT'S PARTY AND FOR

927
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER, IT ANGERS THE

928
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
RIGHT IN HIS PARTY.

929
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
AND SO THOSE ISSUES STILL HAVE

930
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
TO BE RESOLVED BUT I THINK

931
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
THERE'S OPTIMISM AS SPEAKER

932
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
BOEHNER WILL GO BACK AND TALK TO

933
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
HIS FOLKS, PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL

934
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
CONTINUE TO PROD THOSE IN HIS

935
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
PARTY.
BOTH SIDES REALIZE IT'S URGENT

936
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
THAT THERE HAVE TO BE SOME

937
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
CONCESSIONS IN ORDER TO GET THIS

938
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
DEAL DONE BY THE END OF THE

939
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
YEAR.
WHEN YOU SEE SUCH BIG MOVEMENT

940
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
LIKE YOU'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST

941
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
COUPLE OF DAYS, THERE'S MORE

942
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
OPTIMISM THIS WILL GET DONE IN

943
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
TIME.
>> THAT IS TRUE.

944
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
THEY BOTH DID COME OFF THEIR

945
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
INITIAL BARGAINING POSITIONS BY

946
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
A LOT.

947
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> DAN LOTHIAN, THANKS VERY MUCH

948
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
THIS MORNING.

949
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
>> OKAY.
>>> ZORAIDA IS IN NEWTOWN.

950
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000

951
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000

963
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
INCLUDE REINSTATING A BAN ON

964

ASSAULT RIFLES.

965
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS BEEN

THIS IS HAPPENING CHAINWIDE.

973
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE VICTIMS

974
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
OF THE SCHOOL SHOOTING.

975
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000

983
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT JESSICA

REKOS.
SHE WILL BE LAID TO REST TODAY.

985
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
THIS LITTLE 6-YEAR-OLD GIRL

986
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
ADORED HORSES, COULDN'T WAIT

987

UNTIL HER 10th BIRTHDAY TO GET

988
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
ONE.
THAT'S WHAT HER FAMILY PROMISED

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
HER.

990
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I WANT TO SHARE MORE ABOUT HER,

991
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
BECAUSE JUST A SPECTACULAR

992
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
LITTLE GIRL.
HER FAMILY SAYS SHE WAS THE CEO

993
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
OF THE FAMILY.

994
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE TO PLAN

995
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
EVERYTHING INCREDIBLY ORGANIZED.

996
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
SHE WAS A BALL OF FIRE.

997
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
SHE RULED THE ROOST.

998
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
YOU KNOW, THIS LITTLE GIRL LOVED

999
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
TO WRITE.

1000
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
SHE LEFT NOTES ALL OVER THE

1001
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
HOUSE.
HER MOM SAYS THAT SHE FOUND A

1002
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
JOURNAL AND IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT

1003
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
SHE NEEDED, BECAUSE IT SAID I

1004
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
LOVE YOU SO MUCH MOMMA, LOVE
JESSICA.

FINDING NOTES ALL OVER THE HOUSE

1007
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
THAT THIS LITTLE GIRL LEFT

1008
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
BEHIND AND THAT IT'S HELPED THEM

1009
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
WITH THE HEALING PROCESS.

1010
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
THEY ARE COMMITTED TO KEEP THIS
LITTLE GIRL'S MEMORY ALIVE.

1011
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
MEANWHILE, PEOPLE IN NEWTOWN ARE

1012
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
COMING TOGETHER, PRESSING ON AS

1013
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
THEY CONTINUE TO GRIEVE.

1014
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
THE FORMER CHAIRWOMAN OF

1015
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
NEWTOWN'S BOARD OF EDUCATION

1016
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
TELLING OUR WOLF BLITZER THAT

1017
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
SHE FEELS HOLLOW.

1018
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
>> IT'S BEEN HORRIFIC.

1019
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
FROM THE MOMENT WE ALL HEARD THE

1020
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
NEWS, IT WAS DEVASTATING TO KNOW

1021
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
THAT SOMEONE HAD COME INTO THE

1022
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
SCHOOL WITH A GUN.

1023
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
THAT ALONE WAS HORRIBLE ENOUGH,

1024
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
BECAUSE IT'S A PLACE OF PEACE
AND JOY.

1025
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
BUT NOW AS WE GO FORWARD AND

1026
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
WE'VE LEARNED THE NAMES AND NOW

1027
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE

1028
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
GRUELLING PROCESS OF THE

1029
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
FUNERALS, IT'S VERY, VERY, VERY

1030
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
HARD.
EVERYONE USES THE WORD HOLLOW.

1031
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW.

1032
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
>> AND THIS MORNING, IT IS A BIG

1033
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
STEP IN THE RECOVERY PROCESS FOR

1034
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
NEWTOWN STUDENTS AND, OF COURSE,

1035
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
FOR THEIR FAMILIES.

1036
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
THEY ARE ALL HEADED BACK TO

1037
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
SCHOOL THIS MORNING.

1038
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
SANDRA ENDOIS FOLLOWING THE

1039
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM.

1040
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I WOULD IMAGINE THIS WILL BE A

1041
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
DIFFICULT TIME FOR THE PARENTS
AS WELL AS THE KIDS.

1042
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY,

1043
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000

CERTAINLY SOME ANXIETY THIS

1045
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
MORNING AS STUDENTS START

1046
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
RETURNING BACK TO SCHOOL BUT

1047
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
THIS IS A FIRST STEP TOWARDS

1048
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
NORMALCY IN THE WAKE OF THIS

1049
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
TRAGEDY.

1050
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
ROUGHLY 5,400 NEWTOWN DISTRICT

1051
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO RETURN

1052
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
TO CLASS TODAY.

1053
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
THERE WILL BE A TWO-HOUR DELAY.

1054
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
THIS APPLIES TO ALL STUDENTS

1055
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
EXCEPT FOR SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

STUDENTS.
CLASSES THERE ARE STILL

1057
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000

WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE A

1058
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
TWO-HOUR DELAY WS ALSO GRIEF

1059
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
COUNSELORS AND POLICE WILL BE

00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
PRESENT AT NEWTOWN SCHOOLS TODAY

1061
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
AND THROUGHOUT THE WEEK.

1062
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
INTERESTING TO NOTE, PRINCIPALS

1063
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
HAVE ASKED PARENTS TO TALK TO

1064
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT THE

1065
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
INCIDENT BEFORE THEY HEAD BACK

1066
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
INTO THE CLASSROOMS.

1067
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

1068
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
CONTROL WHAT OTHER STUDENTS MAY

1069
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
BE SAYING INSIDE SCHOOL AND THEY

1070
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
DON'T WANT THEM TO LEARN ABOUT

1071
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
WHAT HAPPENED FROM OTHER
STUDENTS.

1072
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
AND IN AN UNCONTROLLED

1073
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
ENVIRONMENT.

1074
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
AND, OF COURSE, ZORAIDA,

1075
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
TEACHERS WILL BE ADDRESSING WHAT

1076
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
HAPPENED IN AN AGE-APPROPRIATE
MANNER.

1077
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
>> ALL RIGHT, SANDRA ENDO LIVE

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000

1314
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
AND MIDWEST COULD AFFECT YOUR

1315
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
TRAVEL PLANS TODAY.

1316
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
IT WAS UGLY HERE IN THE EAST,

1317
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
TOO.

1318
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
LET'S GET TO KAREN McAGAIN NIS

1319
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
IN FOR ROB MARCIANO TODAY.

1320
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
>> JOHN, YES, IT DOES LOOK LIKE

1321
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
A VERY UNSETTLED WEATHER

1322
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
PATTERN, NOT JUST ACROSS THE

1323
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
WEST COAST AND THE EAST BUT

1324
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
MIDWEST, JUST IN TIME FOR

1325
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
CHRISTMAS.
IT LOOKS LIKE IF YOU ARE

1326
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
TRAVELING TOWARDS THE MIDWEST,

1327
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
SERIOUS SNOW EXPECTED THERE IN

1328
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.

1329
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
LOOK AT THE WEST COAST AND

1330
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
SEATTLE, THE SNOW LEVELS HAVE

1331
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
BEEN DOWN AS LOW AS 200 FEET.

1332
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
THEY WILL GO UP TO 400 FEET FOR

1333
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
THE AFTERNOON.

1334
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
SOME OF THESE SNOWFALL TOTALS,

1335
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
VERY SUBSTANTIAL GOING INTO THE

1336
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.

1337
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
COULD SEE 10 OR 20 INCHES OF

1338
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
SNOWFALL.
BUT IN THE MIDWEST, THIS IS WHAT

1339
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
WE'LL FOCUS ON.

1340
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
WE HAVEN'T SEEN A SIGNIFICANT

1341
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
SNOW EVENT LIKE THIS.

1342
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
THIS ONE OCCURS AS WE GO INTO

1343
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
WEDNESDAY AND THEN FOR THURSDAY,

1344
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
SO YOU'RE TRAVELING INTO CHICAGO

1345
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
OR DES MOINES OR TOPEKA, WICHITA

1346
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
AND EVEN INTO DENVER.
YOU COULD EXPECT PERHAPS SOME

1347
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
DELAYS LATER ON IN THE WORKWEEK.

1348
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
HOW ABOUT 48-HOUR SNOWFALL

1349
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
TOTALS?
SPOKANE JUST UNDER 5 INCHES

1350
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
BEING REPORTED THERE.
IN LIBBY, MONTANA, TWO-DAY SNOW

1351
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
TOTALS JUST ABOUT 2 FEET.

1352
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
AND NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT, RIGHT

1353
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000

00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
THE WINDS ARE OUT OF THE EAST

1357
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
AND NORTHEAST BUT AS WE GO INTO

1358
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
THE NEXT FIVE DAYS, WE'LL LOOK

1359
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
AT A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK

1360
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
WEATHERWISE.
THOSE TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN

1361
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
IN THE 40s BUT THEN AS WE GO

1362
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
INTO FRIDAY, THE RAIN IS GOING

1363
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000

1364
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000

TURNING MUCH COOLER.

1366

1367
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000

DOES THE BRAIN CONTAIN CLUES

THE TRAGEDY THERE, THE BIGGEST

1391
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
QUESTION, OF COURSE, IS WHY?

1392
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
WHY DID THE SHOOTER TARGET AN

1393
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?
WHY DID HE GUN DOWN 20 6 AND

1394

CONNECTICUT, MEDICAL

1406

MUSICAL PREFERENCES OR EVEN

1410

LIFESTYLE BUT RATHER LOOKING FOR

1411
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
EVIDENCE OF SPECIFIC PLANS,

1412
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
COULD GIVE SOME CLUES AS TO WHAT

1413
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
WAS HAPPENING IN A PERSON'S MIND

1414
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
AND IN THEIR BRAIN.
IT'S HARD TO KNOW BECAUSE

1415

1452
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
>> WE STILL DON'T KNOW MUCH

1453
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
ABOUT THE SHOOTER WHO LIVED IN

1454
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
THIS HOME BUT THERE IS SOMETHING

1455
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
ELSE TO CONSIDER.

1456
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
WHAT MEDICATIONS, IF ANY, HE WAS
ON.

1457
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I'M SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT

1458
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
ANTIDEPRESSANTS.

1459
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
IF YOU LOOK AT THE STUDIES ON

1460
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
OTHER SHOOTINGS LIKE THIS THAT

1461
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
HAVE HAPPENED, McS LIKE THIS

1462
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
WERE A COMMON FACTOR.

1463
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
NOW, I WANT TO BE CLEAR, NOT

1464
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
SAYING THAT ANTIDEPRESSANTS

1465
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
CAN'T BE EFFECTIVE BUT PEOPLE

1466
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
SEEM TO AGREE THERE IS A

1467
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
VULNERABLE TIME WHEN SOMEONE

1468
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
STARTS THESE MEDICATIONS AND

1469
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
WHEN SOMEONE STOPS COULD LEAD TO

1470
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
INCREASED IMPULSIVITY, DECREASED

1471
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
JUDGMENT AND MAKING SOMEONE OUT
OF TOUCH.

1472
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
NONE OF THIS IS AN EXCUSE AND

1473
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
IT'S NEVER JUST ONE THING.

1474
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
NONE OF THESE BEHAVIORS WILL

1475
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
FULLY PREDICT OR EXPLAIN WHY.

1476
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
BUT SOON AGAIN, THERE WILL BE

1477
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
HINDSIGHT THAT MIGHT JUST HELP

1478
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
PREVENT ANOTHER TRAGEDY.

1479
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000

1632
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
HOUSE REPUBLICANS SAY THIS IS A

1633
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, BUT

1634
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
THEY DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT'S

1635
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
MATH ADDS UP AND LEANS TOO

1636
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
HEAVILY TOWARD TAX INCREASES.

1637
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
WE EXPECT PUSHBACK FROM SENIORS

1638
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
AND OTHERS WHO DEPEND ON

1639
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
ESSENTIAL SECURITY.

1640
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
AS PART OF THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN,

1641
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
HE'S ALSO PROPOSING TO LOWER THE

1642
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
COST OF LIVING INCREASES FOR

1643
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFICIARIES.

1644
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
CERTAINLY THERE, WILL BE SOME

1645
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
RESISTANCE TO THIS.

1646
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000

SIGNIFICANT, MAYBE TEMPORARY, WE

DO YOU SUPPORT OR CONTROL
STRICTER GUN CONTROL LAWS?

LAST POLL TAKEN IN AUGUST,

1675
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
SHOWED THE NUMBER GOING UP 5%.

1676
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
PEW RESEARCH DID A SURVEY, DO

1677
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
YOU THINK THE SHOOTINGS REFLECT

1678
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
A BROADER SOCIETAL ISSUE?

1679
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
WHEN THAT QUESTION WAS ASKED

1680
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000

2341
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
IN ADDITION, THE PRESIDENT

2342
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,000
LOOKING FOR 1$1.2 TRILLION IN NW

2343
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
REVENUE.
DOWN FROM 1.4 TRILLION AND 1.2

2344
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
TRILLION IN SPENDING CUTS.

2345
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
THIS MEETS THE DEMAND THAT

2346
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER HAD FOR EQUAL

2347
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
SPENDING CUTS TO NEW REVENUE.

2348
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
HOUSE AIDES SAY THE MATH DOESN'T

2349
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
ADD UP.

2350
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
THEY SEE THIS AS A MOVE IN THE

2351
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
RIGHT DIRECTION, THEY SAY IT'S

2352
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
NOT BALANCED.

2353
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
SPEAKER BOEHNER, SPOKESMAN

2354
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
BRENDAN BUCK SAYING A PROPOSAL

2355
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
THAT INCLUDES 1.3 TRILLION IN

2356
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
REVENUE FOR $930 BILLION IN

2357
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
SPENDING CUTS CANNOT BE

2358
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
CONSIDERED BALANCED.

2359
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
STILL SOME DIFFERENCES REMAIN.

2360
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
BUT MANY VIEW THIS AS A STEP IN

2361
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
THE RIGHT DIRECTION, JOHN.

2362
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
>> WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS

2363
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
REPUBLICAN CRITICISM TO THE

2364
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL.

2365
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
HE WILL TAKE HEAT FROM THE LEFT

2366
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
HERE ON WHAT HE'S WILLING TO

2367
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
COMPROMISE ON.

2368
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
HE HAS GIVEN GROUND ON A KEY

2369
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000
INDEXING, A MEASUREMENT OF

2370
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
INSPLAGS.
TANTO MOUNT TO CUTTING GROWTH IN

2371
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
THE ENTITLEMENTS.

2372
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

2373
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
AND YOU CAN EXPECT A VERY STRONG

2374
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
PUSHBACK FROM THOSE IN HIS

2375
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
PARTY, UNION MEMBERS AS WELL.

2376
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
ALSO WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE

2377
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
PRESIDENT IS PROPOSING FOR

2378
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
SOCIAL SECURITY, WHERE HE IS

2379
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
TALKING ABOUT LOWERING THE COST

2380
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
OF -- LOWERING THE COST OF

2381
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
LIVING INCREASES FOR SOCIAL

2382
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
SECURITY BENEFICIARIES, THIS IS

2383
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
SOMETHING THAT NO DOUBT A SENIOR

2384
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
ADVOCATES WILL PUSH BACK ON.

2385
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
WE DO SEE QUITE A BIT OF

2386
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
PROGRESS HAPPENED HERE OVER THE

2387
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
LAST FEW HOURS, THERE IS STILL A

2388
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
LITTLE BIT MORE WORK TO DO

2389
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
BEFORE AN AGREEMENT CAN BE

2390
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
REACHED.

2391
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
>> A BIG MEETING BETWEEN SPEAKER

2392
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
BOEHNER AND HOUSE REPUBLICANS,

2393
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
10:00 A.M., COULD BE HUGELY

2394
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
INTERESTING.

2395
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
DAN LOTHIAN, THANK YOU VERY

2396
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
MUCH.
>>> HUNDREDS OF HOLIDAY GIFTS

2397
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
MIGHT NOT GET THERE ON TIME.

2398
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
COMING UP, WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR

2399
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
ABOUT WHAT ONE DELIVERY DRIVER

2400
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
DID WITH A WHOLE LOT OF

2401
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:19,000
PACKAGES.
This holiday, Share Everything.

2402
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Share "Not even close."

2403
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Share "You owe me..."

2404
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Share "Just right."

2405
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
The Share Everything Plan.

2406
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Shareable data across 10 devices

2407
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
with unlimited
talk and text.

2408
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Hurry in for a Droid Razr M

2409
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:15,000
by Motorola for $49.99.

2410
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
>>> WAY TOO FAST.

2411
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
>> AND AS WE JUST MENTIONED, THE

2412
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
PRESIDENT HAS ASKED VOICE

2413
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
PRESIDENT BIDEN TO TAKE THE LEAD

2414
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
IN EXAMINING THE COUNTRY'S GUN

2415
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,000
LAWS, OUTSPOKEN GUN CONTROL

2416
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
ADVOCATE, NEW YORK CITY MAYOR
MIKE BLOOMBERG HAD THIS TO SAY

2417
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
YESTERDAY.

2418
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
>> GUN VIOLENCE IS A NATIONAL

2419
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
EPIDEMIC, AND A NATIONAL

2420
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
TRAGEDY.
THAT DEMANDS MORE THAN WORDS.

2421
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
WE ARE THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED

2422
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
COUNTRY THAT HAS THIS PROBLEM.

2423
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
IN THE WHOLE WORLD, THE ONLY

2424
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
ONE.
AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED IMMEDIATE

2425
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
NATIONAL ACTION FROM THE

2426
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
PRESIDENT AND FROM CONGRESS.

2427
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:48,000
IT SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF THEIR

2428
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
AGENDA.

2429
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
>> OUR NEXT GUEST SAYS SHE'S

2430
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
TAKING IMMEDIATE ACTION,

2431
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
CONGRESSWOMAN SHEILA JACKSON

2432
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
LEE, A DEMOCRAT FROM THE STATE

2433
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
OF TEXAS, CURRENTLY WORKING ON A

2434
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
NEW BILL THAT SHE SAYS COULD

2435
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
PREVENT MORE HORRIFIC MASS

2436
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
MURDERS.

2437
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
NICE TO HAVE YOU WITH US,

2438
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
CONGRESSWOMAN.

2439
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

2440
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
THE PRESIDENT AS I MENTIONED
WHEN WE STARTED THIS SEGMENT,

2441
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
HAS ASKED THE VICE PRESIDENT TO

2442
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
SORT OF LEAD WHAT HIS CABINET

2443
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,000
WILL BE COMING UP WITH, SOME

2444
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
IDEAS, AND HOPEFULLY GOOD

2445
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
PROPOSALS ON HOW TO END THE

2446
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
VIOLENCE.
YOU SAID THERE SHOULD BE AN

2447
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
IMMEDIATE BAN ON ALL ASSAULT

2448
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
WEAPONS.

2449
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
GIVE ME -- WHAT WOULD BE COVERED

2450
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
UNDER WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND?

2451
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, LET ME,

2452
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
AGAIN, OFFER MY DEEPEST SYMPATHY

2453
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
TO THE FAMILIES OF THOSE

2454
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN AND THE

2455
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
FAMILIES OF THOSE WONDERFUL

2456
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
TEACHERS.
SOLEDAD, THE WHOLE NATION MOURNS

2457
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
AND THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT MOMENT

2458
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
IN HISTORY.

2459
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
BAR NONE, THAT SURPASSES ANY OF

2460
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
THE HORRIFIC TRAGEDIES WE FACE,

2461
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
AND THE CALL IS TO ACTION.

2462
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
I HOPE TO COLLABORATE WITH

2463
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, CERTAINLY

2464
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
SENATOR FEINSTEIN, VERY

2465
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,000
THOUGHTFUL IN LEGISLATION WITH

2466
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN AND THERE

2467
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
SHOULD BE A NATIONAL DISCUSSION

2468
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
THAT TALKS ABOUT A NUMBER OF

2469
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
OTHER ITEMS AS WELL.

2470
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
CLOSING THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE IS

2471
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,000
REALLY CLOSING THE GENERAL

2472
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
LOOPHOLE.

2473
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
60% OF AMERICA'S GUNS ARE BOUGHT

2474
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
WITHOUT A BACKGROUND CHECK, AND

2475
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE WE

2476
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
MIGHT HAVE PROTECTED INNOCENT

2477
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
VICTIMS IF WE WOULD HAVE KNOWN

2478
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
WHAT THE CONDITION OF THE

2479
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
PURCHASER WAS.

2480
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
WE NEED IN NATIONAL DIALOG.

2481
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
I'M DELIGHTED THAT THE PRESIDENT

2482
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
HAS TASKED VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN

2483
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
WITH THE EFFORT.
CERTAINLY HE IS ONE WHO CAN

2484
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
BRING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FROM

2485
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, BUT

2486
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
MORE IMPORTANTLY, BOTH HOUSES

2487
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
TOGETHER.
WE HAVE TO STOP THE DIVIDE

2488
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
BETWEEN YOU WANT TO TAKE MY

2489
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,000
GUNS, OR YOU'RE IN AN URBAN AREA

2490
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
AND I'M IN A RURAL AREA, I'M

2491
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
FAMILIAR WITH GUNS, WE'VE GROWN

2492
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
UP WITH GUNS.

2493
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
THIS IS A NATIONAL DIALOG, NOT

2494
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
ABOUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT, WE

2495
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
RESPECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT.

2496
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
IT'S IN THE BILL OF RIGHTS, BUT

2497
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
IT'S A DIALOG ABOUT SAVING LIVES

2498
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS GUN

2499
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
REGULATION LEGISLATION WOULD BE,

2500
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
NOT GUN CONTROL.

2501
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
>> LET'S RUN THROUGH SOME OF THE

2502
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
OTHER THINGS THAT YOU ARE

2503
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
CALLING FOR IN WHAT YOU ARE

2504
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
PROPOSING, IN ADDITION TO

2505
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
CLOSING THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE,

2506
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
ARE YOU CALLING FOR A MORE

2507
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
STRUCTURED MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM

2508
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
FOR FAMILIES THAT WOULD ALLOW

2509
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
THEM TO GET IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE

2510
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
IN REGARD TO MENTAL HEALTH

2511
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,000
ISSUES, LOOKING AT PRIMARY AND

2512
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
SECOND SCHOOLS WHERE THEY MAY

2513
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,000
NEED TO HAVE REINFORCED BULLET

2514
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
PROOF WINDS AND REINFORCED

2515
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
SECURE ENTRANCES, EXPANDING LATE

2516
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
LAWS HOLDING ADULTS RESPONSIBLE

2517
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,000
FOR SECURING THEIR WEAPONS.

2518
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
YOU HAVE PROPOSED THE GUN SAFETY

2519
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
ACT EVERY YEAR FOR THE PAST TEN

WHAT DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE

2522
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
A GROUNDSWELL OF SUPPORT FOR

01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
WHAT YOU ARE PROPOSING NOW THAT

2524
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
GOES FAR -- MUCH FARTHER THAN

2525
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
THE PROPOSAL YOU'VE HAD EVERY

2526
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
YEAR FOR TEN YEARS?

2527

2528
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
COMMON SENSE DISCUSSION AND NEED

2529
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,000
TO ACT IN A COMMON SENSE MANNER

2530
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
HAS NOW RISEN TO THE HIGHEST

2531
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
LEVEL OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF

2532
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,000
AMERICANS.
AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAD A

2533
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
PASSION TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN,

2534
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,000
BUT TO PROTECT OTHERS, NOW SEE A

2535
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,000
WAY FORWARD, IF WE JUST LOOKED

2536
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
AT THE NUMBERS AND SAW THE

2537
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
PERCENTAGES OF INCIDENCES OF

2538
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
HOMICIDE AND SUICIDE, THEY ARE

2539
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
HIGHER WHERE GUNS ARE AVAILABLE.

2540
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
WE HAVE ALL HEARD THE STORY OF

2541
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
THE CHINESE INDIVIDUAL WHO

2542
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
STABBED 22 CHILDREN.

2543
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
BUT THEY ALL LIVED.

2544
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
WE WISH THAT HADN'T HAPPENED.

2545
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I TRULY BELIEVE IF ADULTS ARE

2546
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,000
RESPONSIBLE ABOUT SECURING THEIR

2547
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:51,000
GUNS, ABOUT PUTTING A SAFETY --

2548
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
HAVING SAFETY LOCKS, PROTECTING

2549
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
OUR CHILDREN, WE WOULD BE BETTER

2550
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,000
OFF.
I ALSO BELIEVE VERY, VERY, VERY

2551
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
SINCERELY THAT IF WE ALLOW

2552
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
PEOPLE TO BE UNSTIGMATIZED, IF

2553
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
YOU WILL, WITH RESPECT TO MENTAL

2554
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
HEALTH ISSUES IN THEIR FAMILY,

2555
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
THEY WOULD MORE EAGERLY OR

2556
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
AGGRESSIVELY SEEK HELP AS I

2557
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
BELIEVE THIS PERPETRATOR NEEDED.

2558
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
HE NEEDED ADDITIONAL HELP, AND

2559
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T NEED TO BE

2560
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
TRAGICALLY AROUND GUNS.

2561
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
AND ALSO I KNOW THAT OUR SCHOOLS

2562
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
IN AMERICA ARE AGING.

2563
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,000
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

2564
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
BUT IF THOSE WHO ARE IN

2565
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
LEADERSHIP ROLES WOULD LOOK AT

2566
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:33,000
REINFORCED GLASS AND SECURE

2567
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000

2568
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
POSSIBILITIES IN A VERY

2569

DIFFICULT WORLD AND VERY

2570
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
DIFFICULT CLIMATE.
PARENTS ARE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS,

2571
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
AND WE MUST COMMIT TO THEM WHEN

2572
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,000
THEIR CHILDREN LEAVE THEIR

2573
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
PRECIOUS HOMES THAT THEY CAN GO

2574
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
TO A PLACE OF SAFETY AND

2575

I THINK WE CAN LOOK WAY

2577
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000

AS YOU MENTIONED, SANDY HOOK

2700
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,000
ELEMENTARY STUDENTS WILL STILL

2701
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:57,000
REMAIN OUT OF SCHOOL RIGHT NOW.

2702
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND MORE

2703
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
ACCOMMODATIONS.

2704
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
FOR THE 5,400 STUDENTS, THERE

2705
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,000

2706
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
POLICE BACK AT SCHOOL WHEN

CLASSES RESUME, AS WELL AS

2708
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
TEACHERS DISCUSSING WHAT

2709
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
HAPPENED IN AN AGE-APPROPRIATE

2710
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,000
MANNER.

2711
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
PRINCIPALS HAVE ASKED PARENTS TO

2712
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
TALK TO THEIR KIDS BEFORE THEY

2713
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
RETURN TO SCHOOL ABOUT THE

2714
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
INCIDENT.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT OTHER

2715
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
STUDENTS MAY SAY ABOUT THE

2716
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
MASSACRE AND WHAT MAY HAPPEN IN

2717
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
TERMS OF THE CLASSROOM SETTING.

2718
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
BUT CLEARLY THEY ARE READY TO

2719
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
TAKE ON A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT

2720
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
STUDENTS MAY HAVE AND A LOT OF

2721
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
FEELINGS, THE EMOTION, THE PAIN

2722
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,000
THAT THIS COMMUNITY IS FEELING.

2723
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,000
SOLEDAD.

2724
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
>> SANDRA ENDO, THANK YOU,

01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
SANDRA.

INVESTIGATION ONGOING AS TO WHAT

2728
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:48,000
COULD HAVE CAUSED THE TRAGEDY AT

2729
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY TO OCCUR.

2730
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,000
AUTHORITIES ARE DIGGING DEEPER

2731
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
INTO THE GUN AND COMPUTER USAGE

2732
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
OF THE GUNMAN.

2733
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
THE GUNMAN IN THE NEWTOWN,

HIMSELF BEFORE ANYONE COULD GET

2736
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
THE REASONS THAT COMPELLED HIM

2737
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
TO KILL MORE THAN 2 DOZEN

2738
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
PEOPLE.

THANK YOU, WE APPRECIATE IT.

2744
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,000
WE KNOW THEY SEIZED A SMASHED

"THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTS

2747
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
THEY GOT NOTHING FROM IT, BUT

2748
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
THE STATE POLICE SAY THEY ARE

2749
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
HAPPY WITH THE PROGRESS THEY ARE

2750
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,000
MAKING.

2751
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,000
WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY STAND?

2752
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
>> THE STATE POLICE HAVE BEEN

2753
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
GATHERING ALL KINDS OF

2754
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
INFORMATION AND EVIDENCE FROM

2755
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
THE HOME, FROM THE SCHOOL.

2756
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
THEY DON'T COMMENT DIRECTLY ON

2757
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
WHAT THEY SEIZE.

2758
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
BUT LIEUTENANT VANCE AT THE

2759
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
STATE POLICE SAID THEY HAVE

2760
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
OBTAINED HELPFUL EVIDENCE,

2761
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
IMPORTANT EVIDENCE, THAT THEY

2762
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
BELIEVE WILL HELP LEAD THEM TO

2763
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:51,000
AN ANSWER AS TO WHY THIS

2764
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
HAPPENED.
>> NOW, THEY ARE SUGGESTING IT

2765
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
WILL BE A WHILE BEFORE WE HEAR

2766
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,000
ANYTHING CONCRETE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF HOW LONG

2767
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,000
BEFORE PERHAPS WE'LL HAVE SOME

2768
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:05,000
ANSWERS HERE?
>> I THINK IT COULD BE MONTHS.

2769
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
CERTAINLY WEEKS.

2770
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
WE HAD AN AWFUL SHOOTING SEVERAL

2771
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
YEARS AGO HERE IN CONNECTICUT

2772
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
AND THAT INVESTIGATION TOOK A

2773
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
YEAR.
THE STATE POLICE ARE NOT IN A

2774
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
RUSH TO GET THIS DONE.

2775
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:18,000
THEY WILL TAKE AS LONG AS IT

2776
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,000
TAKES.
>> YOU KNOW THIS COMMUNITY WELL.

2777
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
HAVE YOU BEEN COVERING STORIES

2778
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
HERE FOR 18 YEARS.

2779
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
WHAT ARE YOUR IMPRESSIONS OF HOW

2780
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,000
THIS AFFECTED THE IMMEDIATE

2781
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
AREA?

2782
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
>> EVERYWHERE IN CONNECTICUT, I

2783
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
HAVE GONE, IN THE PAST FEW DAYS,

2784
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
EVERYONE IS IMPACTED BY THIS.

2785
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT IT.

2786
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,000
PEOPLE ARE JUST HORRIBLY BROKEN

2787
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
UP, NOT TO THE DEGREE THAT THE

2788
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS AND THE

2789
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
PEOPLE CLOSE TO THOSE PEOPLE IN

2790
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
NEWTOWN ARE, BUT THE WHOLE STATE

2791
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
IS MOURNING.
AND THE MORE I TALKED TO PEOPLE

2792
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
ABOUT IT, THE MORE I FIND THAT

2793
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,000
PEOPLE ARE LINKED SOMEHOW TO

2794
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
THIS TRAGEDY.

2795
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
THEY HAVE A FRIEND, A COWORKER.

2796
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
WHEN PEOPLE RETURN TO WORK

2797
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
MONDAY, THEY LEARNED THAT IN

2798
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
MANY INSTANCES THAT FRIENDS HAD

2799
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:09,000
SUFFERED A LOSS IN THIS TRAGEDY.

2800
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
>> AND, DAVID, TELL US YOUR

2801
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
PERSONAL STORY ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE GOING OUT

2802
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
TO COVER THIS STORY.

2803
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
WHAT DID ANOTHER REPORTER ASK

2804
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,000
YOU TO DO?

2805
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
>> ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES, BILL

2806
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:26,000
LUKEHART, I HAVE WORKED WITH HIM

2807
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,000
AT THE "HARTFORD COURANT" FOR

2808
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
YEARS, AND WE WERE IN NEWTOWN

2809
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:34,000
FRIDAY MORNING AND WE MET BY THE

2810
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
FIREHOUSE AT THE FOOT OF THE

2811
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
SCHOOL.
AND HE TOLD ME HIS STEPDAUGHTER

2812
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
WAS SUBSTITUTING AT SANDY HOOK

2813
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
ELEMENTARY AND HE WROTE HER NAME

2814
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,000
DOWN, LAUREN ROUSSEAU ON A PIECE

2815
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
OF PAPER FROM A NOTEBOOK AND

2816
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
HANDED IT TO ME, AND ASKED ME TO

2817
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR HER AND OF

2818
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
COURSE, WE FOUND OUT LATER THAT

2819
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
SHE WAS ONE OF THE TEACHERS WHO

2820
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,000
DIED.
>> DID YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM

2821
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,000
THAT?
>> NO.

2822
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
THE EDITORS IN HARTFORD HAD

2823
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
BEGUN TO HAVE AN IDEA THAT THERE

2824
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
WAS A PROBLEM.

2825
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
BILL LEARNED QUICKLY TOO,

2826
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
BECAUSE THE STATE POLICE HAD

2827
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
BEGUN ASSIGNING TROOPERS TO THE

2828
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS TO HELP

2829
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:17,000
THEM BEGIN TO HAVE A LIAISON

01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
FAMILY.

2833
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
>> WOW.

2834
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000

2835
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
