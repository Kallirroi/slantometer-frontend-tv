1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
>> BUT I WAS SUCH A NICE JEWISH

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
GIRL, THAT I SAID, MARLON, I

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
CAN'T STAY OVERFLIGHT WITH YOU.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I I WILL GO WITH YOU FOR THE DAY

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE ME HOME.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
>> SO MARLON CLEARLY WANTED TO
DO MORE THAN SEE THE FLOWERS

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
WITH YOU.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
>> HE WANTED TO SLEEP IN THE

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
DESERT WITH ME.

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
>> YOU TURNED DOWN MARLON

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
BRANDO?

12
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

13
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
>> HOW DID HE TAKE REJECTION?

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
>> IT WAS FINE.

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
>> A REMARKABLE CONVERSATION
WITH A REMARKABLE LADY.

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
BARBRA STREISAND WITH ME FOR THE

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
HOUR TOMORROW NIGHT AT 9:00 P.M.

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
EAST PERSON THAT'S ALL FOR

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
TONIGHT.

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
AC 360 STARTS NOW.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT.
THE WOMAN BELIEVED TO BE

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CHOICE FOR

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS NO

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
THANKS.
U.N. AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
SHE WAS THE ONE CAUGHT UP IN THE

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
CONTROVERSY OF HER STATEMENTS

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
AFTER THE MURDER OF FOUR

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
AMERICANS IN LIBYA.

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
YOU WILL RECALL THE PRESIDENT

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
STOOD UP FOR HER USING BLUNT

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
LANGUAGE SAYING ANYONE WHO HAS A

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
PROBLEM WITH HER HAS A PROBLEM

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
WITH HIM.

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
INSTEAD THERE WON'T BE

35
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
CONFRONTATION BECAUSE AMBASSADOR

36
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
RICE TOOK HERSELF OUT OF

37
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
CONTENTION WRITING THE PRESIDENT

38
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
SHE IS HONORED TO BE CONSIDERED

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
FOR THE OFFICE SAYING, I AM NOW

40
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
CONVINCED THAT THE CONFIRMATION

41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
PROCESS WOULD BE LENGTHY,

42
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
DISRUPTIVE AND COSTLY AND THAT

43
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
TRADE-OFF IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH IT

44
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
TO OUR COUNTRY.

45
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
>> TODAY I MADE THE DECISION

46
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
THAT IT WAS THE BEST THING FOR

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
OUR COUNTRY, FOR THE AMERICAN

48
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
PEOPLE, THAT I CONTINUE TO BE

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
CRED BY THE PRESIDENT FOR

50
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
NOMINATION OF SECRETARY OF STATE

51
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE A

52
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
CONFIRMATION PROCESS THAT WAS

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
VERY PROLONGED, VERY

54
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
POLITICIZED, VERY DISTRACTING,

55
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
AND VERY DISRUPTIVE BECAUSE

56
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WE NEED

57
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
TO GET DONE AS A COUNTRY AND THE

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
FIRST SEVERAL MONTHS OF THE

59
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
PRESIDENT'S AGENDA IS REALLY THE

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE CRUCIAL

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
THINGS DONE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

62
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
REFORM, BALANCED DEFICIT

64
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
REDUCTION, JOB CREATION.
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
AND TO THE EXTENT MY NOMINATION

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
COULD HAVE DELAYED, DISTRACTED

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
OR DEFLECTED PRIORITIES

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE I DIDN'T

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
WANT THAT AND I WOULD MUCH

70
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
PREFER TO CONTINUE DOING WHAT

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'M DOING, WHICH IS A JOB I LOVE

72
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
AT THE UNITED NATIONS.

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA ACCEPTED HER

74
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
DECISION TO BOW OUT CALLING HER

75
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
AN EXTRAORDINARILY PATRIOTIC

76
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
PERSON.

77
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
WITH MORE ON WHO LED UP TO THAT

78
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
DECISION, DANA, WHAT WAS THE

79
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR ALL OF THIS

80
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
FOR AMBASSADOR RICE?

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
>> FIRST OF ALL WITH HER CHIEF

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
FOES, SENATORS, McCAIN, GRAHAM

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
AND AYOTE.

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY A

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
REPUBLICAN WHO HADN'T QUITE MADE

86
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
UP HER MIND.

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
THAT THE MODERATE REPUBLICAN

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
FROM MAINE, SUSAN COLLINS.

89
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
BY ALL ACCOUNTS THAT MEETING DID

90
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
NOT GO WELL AT ALL ACCORDING TO

91
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH THAT

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
MEETING.

93
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
SHE REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO ANSWER

94
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
REALLY BASIC QUESTIONS AND GOT

95
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
FRUSTRATED AND MAYBE EVEN A

96
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
LITTLE PRICKLY AT SOME OF THE

97
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
BASIC QUESTIONS AND AFTER THAT,

98
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
THE FEELING, EVEN AMONG

99
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
DEMOCRATS WHO TALKED TO

100
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
REPUBLICANS IS THEY WEREN'T SURE

101
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
IF SHE CAN'T HANDLE MEETINGS

102
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
WITH U.S. SENATORS, HOW IS SHE

103
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
GOING TO BE ON THE WORLD STAGE

104
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
REPRESENTING THE U.S. THERE.

105
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
SO THAT DEFINITELY WAS AN ISSUE.

106
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE

107
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
PRESIDENT IN HIS STATEMENT MADE

108
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
CLEAR THAT HE DIDN'T THINK SUSAN

109
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
RICE WAS TREATED FAIRLY.

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS THAT

111
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
POLITICS WERE AT PLAY HERE.

112
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
SHE ILLUSTRATED THAT.

113
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
BUT IT WAS MORE THAN THAT.

114
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
ALSO PERSONALITY DRIVEN.
EVEN DEMOCRATS THINK SHE IS VERY

115
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
SMART, VERY CAPABLE BUT DOESN'T

116
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
HAVE THE RIGHT PERSONALITY FOR

117
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
THIS JOB.

118
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
>> GLORIA, EARLIER I HEARD YOU

119
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
SAY THAT AMBASSADOR RICE WAS

120
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
PROBABLY UNDERESTIMATED BY THE

121
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
CLUB.

122
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
WHAT DID YOU MEAN FROM THAT?

123
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
>> THAT WAS FROM A DEMOCRAT

124
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE WHO

125
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
SAYS THE CLUB IS REALLY

126
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
IMPORTANT ON CAPITOL HILL.

127
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
JOHN KERRY IS THE LEADER IN THAT

128
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
CLUB.

129
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
JOHN McCAIN LIKES HIM AN AWFUL

130
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
LOT AND WOULD CLEARLY GO ALONG

131
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
WITH THAT NOMINATION.

132
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
ALSO WHEN SHE TRAVELED UP THERE,

133
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
AND SHE WANTED TO GO UP THERE TO
TALK TO THESE SENATORS, THERE IS

134
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
A SENSE FROM THE SOURCE THAT SHE

135
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
OVER HER ABILITY TO WOO THEM

136
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
OVER.

137
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
THAT WAS A BIG PREEXISTING

138
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
CONDITION FOR HER.

139
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
AS DANA JUST POINTED OUT, SHE

140
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
DIDN'T WIN OVER SUSAN COLLINS

141
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
WHO WAS QUITE IMPORTANT TO HER.

142
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
>> DAVID, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

143
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
THIS?

144
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
IS THIS JUST A SIGN OF HOW

145
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
PARTISAN THINGS HAVE BECOME OR

146
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
WAS IT PRETTY CLEAR FROM AS SOON

147
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
AS THE CONTROVERSY OVER

148
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
BENGHAZI, THE COMMENTS BEGAN

149
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN?

150
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
>> I DON'T THINK THIS IS JUST

151
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
ABOUT PARTISANSHIP.

152
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
AND I DON'T THINK IT IS JUST

153
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
GOOD BENGHAZI.

154
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
THAT WAS AN ISSUE OF COURSE.

155
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
BUT IN THIS CASE, THERE ARE A

156
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
NUMBER OF SENATORS ON BOTH SIDES

157
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
TO THE AISLE THAT BELIEVE THE

158
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
UNITED STATES HAS TOUGH WORK

159
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
AHEAD IN INTERNATIONAL

160
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
RELATIONS.

161
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
SOMEONE HAS TO NEGOTIATE WITH

162
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
THE IRANIANS TO MAKE SURE WE

163
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
DON'T GET INTO A CONFLICT THERE

164
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
AND SOMEONE WITH A TOUGHNESS AND

165
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
AUTHORITY OF A JIM BAKER AND

166
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
FRANKLY, THERE WAS A SENSE ABOUT

167
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
SUSAN RICE THAT EVEN THOUGH SHE

168
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
IS VERY TALENTED AND I THINK SHE

169
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
DID A GENEROUS THING TODAY BY

170
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
WITHDRAWING, SHE REALLY WAS

171
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
LOYAL TO HER PRESIDENT BY HIM

172
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
DOING THAT.

173
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
BUT THERE WAS ALSO A SENSE THAT

174
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE WEIGHT.

175
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE BACKGROUND

176
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THAT SENATOR KERRY DOES.

177
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
AND HE IS EXTREMELY SCHOOLED AND

178
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
KNOWS THE ROUGH PARTS OF THE

179
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
WORLD.

180
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
THERE WAS A SENSE IN THE SENATE
THAT PEOPLE THERE WOULD JUST BE

181
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
MORE COMFORTABLE WITH HIM

182
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
REPRESENTING THE UNITED STATES.

183
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
>> DAVID, WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS

184
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
SAYS ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA

185
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
HIMSELF.

186
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
IT SEEMS LIKE, ESPECIALLY IN THE

187
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000

THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO

THEIR DAD AND THERE COULD BE
MORE CASES LIKE HIS.

408
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
HE WAS TREATED IN PITTSBURGH'S

409
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
VA SYSTEM, ONE OF THE MOST

410
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
HIGHLY REGARDED IN THE NATION

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000

WHAT HE CAUGHT THERE,

413
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000

CONTAMINATED WATER SUPPLIES.

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
WHAT MAKES THIS STORY EVEN MORE

417
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
TROUBLING IS THE EVIDENCE CNN

418
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
HAS UNCOVERED.

419
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
IT SHOWS THAT HOSPITAL OFFICIALS

420
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
KNEW ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND YET

421
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
APPARENTLY THEY FAILED TO FIX

422
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
IT.

423
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
SINCE JANUARY OF LAST YEAR, LAST

424
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
YEAR, THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST

425
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
FIVE CASES DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO

426
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
THE VA HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN

427
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
PITTSBURGH, BUT ONLY LAST MONTH

428
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
DID THE VA ADMIT THEY HAD A

429
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
PROBLEM WITH THEIR WATER SUPPLY.

430
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
THEY SAID SO IN A NEWS RELEASE

431
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
AND ISSUED TWO MORE, INCLUDING

432
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
ONE THAT SAID THE PROBLEM HAS

433
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
BEEN SOLVED.

434
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
APART FROM NEWS RELEASES,

435
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
THOUGH, THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT

436
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
TALKING.

437
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
HOWEVER, DREW GRIFFIN IS

438
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
INVESTIGATING.

439
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
>> HE FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THE

440
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
VA WAS GOING TO GIVE HIM THE

441
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
BEST CARE THEY COULD POSSIBLY

442
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
GIVE HIM.
>> KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW NOW,

443
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
DID THE VA GIVE HIM THE BEST

444
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
CARE POSSIBLE?

445
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
>> NO.

446
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
NO, THEY DIDN'T.

447
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I MEAN I CAN SAY THERE WAS

448
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
STRONG NEGLIGENCE ON THE VA'S

449
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
PART.

450
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000

451
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
HIS FATHER, BILL.

452
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
A WORLD WAR II NAVY HERO, WHO

453
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
WOULD DROP INTO HOSTILE WATERS

454
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
TO SAVE DOWNED NAVY PILOTS.

455
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
BUT BILL NICHOLAS DIED THE DAY

456
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
AFTER THANKSGIVING FROM HEART

457
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000

HE CONTRACTED IT FROM USING THE

460
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
WATER AT THE VA, WHICH WAS

461
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
CONTAMINATED WITH HIGH LEVELS OF

462
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
A BACTERIA, THE CAUSE OF

THIS SAME PITTSBURGH VA.

469
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000

475
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
MONTH AGO.

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
WOULD PUT THEIR VETERANS IN THAT

479
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000

AMOUNT OF DISINFECTANT IN THE

483
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
VA'S WATER WAS LESS THAN THE

484
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
AMOUNT NEEDED TO PREVENT THE

485
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000

495
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
OBVIOUS EVIDENCE THAT THE

INSTALLED THE VA'S WATER SYSTEM,

500

THE VA HOSPITAL IN PITTSBURGH

505
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
KNEW IT HAD A PROBLEM, WAS

506

WARNED ABOUT IT AND DID NOT FIX

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
IT.

508
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000

NECESSARY FOR THE EFFICACY OF

513
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
>> DID YOU TELL THE HOSPITAL?

514
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
>> YES, WE DID.

515
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
YES, WE DID.

516
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
WE TOLD THEM -- WE ACTUALLY HAD

517
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
TWO AUDITS AND TOLD THEM TWICE

518
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
THAT THEY WERE DEFICIENT IN

519
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000

521
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
THE SYSTEM HAD JUST BEEN

522
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
MAINTAINED, IF THE HOSPITAL HAD

523
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
JUST LISTENED AND MADE SIMPLE

524

ADJUSTMENTS, HE SAYS HE BELIEVES

525
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED.

526
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000

534
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000

550
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
TOLD BY THE VA THAT THEIR

552
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
PATIENT GOT LEGIONNAIRE'S FROM

556
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
THE HOSPITAL'S WATER.

557
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
SHE SAYS IF SHE WERE STILL THERE

558
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
MONITORING THE WATER, THIS

559
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
ENTIRE TRAGEDY WOULD HAVE BEEN

560
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
PREVENTED WITH THE TURN OF A

561
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
KNOB.

562
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
>> SO THIS IS NOT, AS THEY SAY,

563
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
ROCKET SCIENCE.

564
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
THIS IS STRAIGHTFORWARD.

565
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
>> SO WHAT WENT WRONG?

566
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
OUR CALLS AND E-MAILS TO THE VA

567
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
WENT UNANSWERED, SO KEEPING THEM

568
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
HONEST, WE WENT TO THE UNITED

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
HOSPITAL IN PITTSBURGH IN HOPES

571
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
OF GETTING ANSWERS.

572
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
WE WERE MET BY FOUR ARMED

573
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
FEDERAL OFFICERS.

574
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
>> HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

575
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
DREW GRIFFIN WITH CNN.

576
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
>> WE'RE WITH THE VA POLICE.

577
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000

578
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
THEM.
>> I CAN'T TECHNICALLY CALL

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
THEM.

587
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE THE

TOLD US TO LEAVE.

594
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000

OF HERE?

596
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
>> IT'S OUR POLICY ACTUALLY.

597
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
>> YOUR POLICY?

598
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
WE CAN'T STAND ON UNITED STATES

>> WITHOUT A LEGITIMATE PURPOSE

601
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
FOR BEING HERE.

602

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
THESE PATIENTS DIED.

604
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
>> AND BEING NEWS MEDIA WHILE

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
RECORDING, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
ASK YOU TO LEAVE UNTIL IT'S

607
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
APPROVED BY OUR PUBLIC AFFAIRS

609
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
>> INSTEAD OF ANSWERING OUR

610
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
QUESTIONS, THE VA SPOKESPERSON

611
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
HAS RELEASED THREE MEDIA

612
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
ADVISORIES, THE LAST ONE ON THE

613
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
DAY WE VISITED READ IN A VOICE

614
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
MAIL.

615
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
>> VA IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING

616
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
SAFE FACILITIES AND QUALITY CARE

617
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
FOR VETERANS.

618
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
>> THE ADVISORY GOES ON TO SAY

619
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
THAT AN INVESTIGATION IS UNDER

620
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
WAY AND THAT --

621
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
>> TESTING RESULTS INDICATE THE

622
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
REMEDIATION AT PITTSBURGH VA

623
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
MEDICAL CENTER UNIVERSITY DRIVE

624
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

625
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
>> BILL NICHOLAS' FLAG STILL

626
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
FLIES ON THE FRONT LAWN THAT HE

627
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
MOWED HIMSELF.

628
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
HE WOULD HAVE TURNED 88 THIS

629
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
PAST WEEKEND.

630
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
INSTEAD OF CELEBRATING HIS

631
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
BIRTHDAY, HIS FAMILY HELD A

632
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
MEMORIAL SERVICE.

633
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
>> THEY SHOULD HAVE THE BEST AND

634
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
UTMOST CARE THAT ANYBODY ELSE,

635
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
EVEN BETTER THAN A NORMAL
CIVILIAN.

636
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
THEY FOUGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY,

637
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
THEY GO TO BATTLE, YOU KNOW,

638
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY AND

639
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
WHERE DO THEY GO?

640
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
THEY GO TO A HOSPITAL AND THEY

641
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
BASICALLY DIE IN THERE.

642
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
>> ANDERSON, LET ME TELL YOU

643
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

644
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
BILL NICHOLAS.

645
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
THIS GUY, DRAFTED AT 17 YEARS

646
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
OLD INTO THE U.S. NAVY.

647
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
HE WOULD DRIVE 30 MILES OUT OF

648
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
HIS WAY PAST TWO OTHER HOSPITALS

649
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
JUST TO GO TO THE VA, BECAUSE HE

650
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
THOUGHT HE WOULD GET BETTER CARE

651
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
THERE AS A VETERAN, WHICH IS WHY

652
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
HIS SONS REALLY FEEL LET DOWN BY

653
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
THIS.

654
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
>> WE KNOW THREE POSSIBLE DEATHS

655
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
DUE TO THIS LEGIONELLA AT THE

656
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
HOSPITAL.

657
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
BUT THERE COULD BE MORE DEATHS,

658
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
RIGHT?

659
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
>> CERTAINLY, ALL OF THE

660
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
INFORMATION ONES THIS CASES, 29

661
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
CASES, IS COMING FROM THE

662
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
HOSPITAL.

663
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A

664
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
YEAR NOW, ANDERSON.

665
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I THINK A LOT OF HEALTH CARE

666
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
PROFESSIONALS, A LOT OF

667
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
FAMILIES, QUITE FRANKLY, ARE

668
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
GOING TO LOOK BACK OVER THIS

669
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
YEAR, LOOK BACK AT THE FAMILY

670
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
MEMBERS THEY MAY HAVE LOST, AND

671
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
BEGIN ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT

672
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
WHAT THIS WAS THAT KILLED THEIR

673
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
LOVED ONE.

674
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
COULD IT HAVE BEEN THIS

675
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE.

676
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
>> AND WHO BESIDES US ARE TRYING

677
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
TO GET ANSWERS ON THIS?

678
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
IS THE VA STILL REFUSING TO TALK

679
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
TO YOU?

680
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
>> YEAH, THEY WILL NOT COME OUT.

681
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
AS YOU SAW IN THAT PIECE, THEY

682
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
WON'T TALK TO US AT ALL.

683
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
THE VA IN PITTSBURGH REFERRED US

684
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
TO THE WASHINGTON PR DIVISION

685
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
WHO SENT US RIGHT BACK TO

686
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
PITTSBURGH.

687
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
IT'S BEEN A MESS.

688
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
BUT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE

689
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
CONTROL AND PREVENTION, THEY DID

690
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
SEND A TEAM THERE IN NOVEMBER TO

691
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
INVESTIGATE THIS.

692
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
WE'RE TOLD THAT THE

693
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
INVESTIGATION, THE RESULTS FROM

694
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
THE CDC WILL GO TO THE VA IN THE

695
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
COMING WEEKS.

696
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
WE'RE NOT SURE IF THAT'S GOING

697
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
TO BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC.

698
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
>> I STILL CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY

699
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
THE VA DID NOTHING WHEN THEY

700
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
KNEW THEY HAD A PROBLEM?

701
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
>> ACTUALLY, ANDERSON, WE FOUND

702
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
OUT THAT ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO

703
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
THE VA DID BRING IN A CONSULTANT

704
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
WHO MADE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW

705
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
TO FIX THE WATER, BUT THE VA DID

706
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
NOT TELL THAT CONSULTANT THAT

707
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
THEY HAD LEGIONNAIRE'S CASES AT

708
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
THE HOSPITAL.

709
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
IF THEY HAD TOLD THE CONSULTANTS

710
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN

711
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS.

712
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
THE VA WOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD TO

713
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
HANDLE IT DIFFERENTLY.

714
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHY, BECAUSE
THE VA WON'T TALK TO US.

715
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
>> THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

716
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
DREW, APPRECIATE IT, THANKS.

SUFFERS WHAT SHE HAS ENDURED.

926
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
of Washington about the future
of Medicare and Social Security.

927
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
ANNCR: But you deserve straight
talk about the options on the...

928
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
table and what they mean for you
and your family.

929
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
ANCR: AARP is cutting through
all the political spin.

930
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Because for our 37 million
members, only one word counts.

THOSE LITTLE THINGS
FOR YOU, LIFE'S ABOUT HER.

934
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
BUT YOUR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION -

935
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000

LIKE NEEDING TO GO
FREQUENTLY OR URGENTLY.

944
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR

945
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
ABOUT ALL YOUR MEDICAL
CONDITIONS AND MEDICATIONS,

946
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
AND ASK IF YOUR HEART IS HEALTHY
ENOUGH FOR SEXUAL ACTIVITY.

947
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
DO NOT TAKE CIALIS IF YOU TAKE
NITRATES FOR CHEST PAIN,

948
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
AS THIS MAY CAUSE AN UNSAFE
DROP IN BLOOD PRESSURE.

949
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL
IN EXCESS WITH CIALIS.

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
TO AVOID LONG-TERM INJURY,

953
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP

954
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
FOR AN ERECTION LASTING
MORE THAN FOUR HOURS.

955
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
IF YOU HAVE ANY SUDDEN DECREASE
OR LOSS IN HEARING OR VISION,

956
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
OR IF YOU HAVE ANY ALLERGIC
REACTIONS SUCH AS RASH, HIVES,

957
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000

OR DIFFICULTY BREATHING
OR SWALLOWING,

959
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
STOP TAKING CIALIS AND GET
MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY.

960
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
CIALIS FOR DAILY USE

STREETS.

975
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
HE WAS RELEASED FROM A MENTAL

976
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
HEALTH FACILITY JUST YESTERDAY.

977
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
THE CASE IS AS CONTROVERSIAL AS

978
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
IT IS HORRIFYING.

979

5-YEAR-OLD OLIVIER AND HIS

980
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
3-YEAR-OLD SISTER WERE STABBED

981

TO DEATH IN THEIR OWN BEDS.

WOUNDS.

AS HORRIBLE AS THOSE FACTS ALONE

985

ARE, THE REST IS WORSE.

986
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000

THE ONE WHO KILLED THEM AND HE

988
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
CONFESSED.

989
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
BUT A CANADIAN JURY RULED THAT

00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
HE WASN'T CRIMINALLY RESPONSIBLE

991
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
BECAUSE OF HIS MENTAL STATE AT

992
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
THE TIME.

993
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
INSTEAD OF PRISON, HE WAS SENT

MY LITTLE GIRL HAD 19 WOUNDS.

1019
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
MAYBE SHE WAS LUCKIER BECAUSE

1020

SHE HAD ONE THAT WAS MORE MORTAL

1021
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000

IN 2010 A CANADIAN JURY FAILED

00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
TO CONVICT HIM OF THE MURDERS,

1045

WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A FAMILY

BRUTALLY STABBED THEM IN HIS

THE DOCTOR.

1058
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000

MENTALLY INSANE WHEN HE

1067
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
COMMITTED THE MURDERS, AND DO

ACCEPT HE IS MENTALLY ILL, WHEN

1074
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I LOOK AT THE FACTS, OKAY.

1075
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
WE HAVE A PERSON THAT'S A

1076

COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN WHAT HE WAS

1083
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
IN A YEAR.

1103
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS

1104
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
CURRENTLY TREATING THE DOCTOR

1105
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
AND THE PSYCHIATRIC EXPERTS WHO

1106
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
GAVE TESTIMONY AT HIS TRIAL HAVE

1107
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
TOLD CNN THEY DO NOT WISH TO

1108
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
COMMENT ON THE CASE.

1109
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
DR. GASTON SAYS SHE FEARS FOR

1110
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
HER LIFE NOW, AND BELIEVES THE

1111
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
PSYCHIATRISTS THAT TESTIFIED ON

1112
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
HIS BEHALF DID NOT EVALUATE HIM

1113
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
LONG ENOUGH.

1114
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
SHE IS CALLING FOR STRICTER

1115

GUIDELINES WHEN PSYCHIATRIC

1116
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
TESTIMONY IS PRESENTED IN COURT.

1117
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
SHE SAYS SHE HAS NEVER BELIEVED

1118
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
HER EX-HUSBAND WAS MENTALLY ILL,

1119
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
AND EVEN IF HE WAS, HE COULD NOT

1120
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
NOW BE CURED IN LITTLE MORE THAN

1121
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
THREE YEARS.

1122
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
>> WHAT I'M SAYING, I HAVE

1123
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
QUESTION.

1124
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I'M A MOTHER BUT I'M ALSO A

1125
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
DOCTOR.

1126
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
>> YOU HOPE IT WILL HELP OTHER
VICTIMS IN THE FUTURE?

1127
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
>> YES, I HOPE.

1128
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M VERY

1129
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
CONVINCED.

1130
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'M WILLING TO LOSE MY HEALTH,

1131
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I'M WILLING TO LOSE MY ECONOMY

1132
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000

1135
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I'M WILLING TO GO VERY FAR IN

1136
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
THIS BATTLE.

1137
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
AND I'M REALLY, REALLY CONVINCED

1138
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
THAT IT HAS TO CHANGE.

1139
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
>> DID YOU EVER ASK HIM WHY HE

1140
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
DID IT?

1141
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
>> I WANTED TO ASK HIM, BUT, YOU

1142
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
KNOW, THE RESPONSE THAT HE'S

1143
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
GOING TO GIVE ME, IF HE DOESN'T

1144
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
TELL ME THE TRUTH, THAT IS MY
TRUTH THAT I KNOW IS FOR

1145
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
VENGEANCE, YOU KNOW.

1146
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
HE WILL INVENT EVERYTHING, AND

1147
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
THAT'S WHAT HE DID IN COURT, YOU

1148
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
KNOW.

1149
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
>> AND DR. GASTON SAYS SHE

1150
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
BELIEVES IT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT

1151
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
TEST CASE TO POSSIBLY LIMIT

1152
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
CLAIMS OF MENTAL INSANITY AND

1153
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
BETTER SCRUTINIZE THE MEDICAL

1154
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
EVIDENCE NEEDED TO PROVE IT.

1155
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
>> THAT IS SUCH A HORRIFIC

1156
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
CRIME.

1157
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000

HERE TODAY, ANDERSON.

1164
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT.

1165
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
THE OUTRAGE STEMS FROM TWO

1166
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
THING.
ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE

1167
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
HEADLINES, LOOK, ANDERSON, THIS

1168
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
GUY STABBED HIS CHILDREN 46

1169
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
TIMES, HE CONFESSED TO IT.

1170
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
HE SERVED 46 MONTHS, NOT ALL OF

1171
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
IT IN PRISON.

1172
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
HE IS A FREE MAN RIGHT NOW.

1173
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
ADD TO THAT THAT THE MENTAL

1174
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
FACILITY ACTUALLY SAID, LOOK,

1175
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
THIS GUY DOES PRESENT A RISK TO

1176
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
SOCIETY.

1177
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
WE DON'T KNOW HOW HE'LL BEHAVE

1178
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
IN THE FUTURE, BUT HE NEEDS TO

1179
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
BE FREE AND WE CAN MANAGE THAT

1180
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
RISK.

1181
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
ANDERSON, I'LL REMIND YOU, THERE
WILL BE NO POLICE OFFICER

1182
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
FOLLOWING HIM AROUND.

1183
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
NOT ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

1184
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
AND THE PUBLIC WANTS TO KNOW
WHY.

1185
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
>> I MEAN THAT'S JUST

1186
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
INCREDIBLE.

1187
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
FOR SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME

1188
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
THAT HE ACTUALLY WAS IN THIS

1189
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY.

1190
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
WHAT IS NEXT FOR HIM?

1191
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
>> Reporter: WELL, THIS IS THE

OTHER OUTRAGEOUS THING PEOPLE

ARE TELLING ME.

1194
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
IN HIS TESTIMONY AS TO WHY HE

1195
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
WANTED TO BE RELEASED, HE SAID

1196
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
HE WANTED TO LEAD A NORMAL LIFE.

1197
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
HE'S GOING TO APPLY AGAIN TO

1198
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
PRACTICE MEDICINE.

1199
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
HE IS A CARDIOLOGIST, HE DOESN'T

1200
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS AGAINST HIM

1201
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF CARE HE

1202
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
HAD FOR HIS PATIENTS.

1203
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
HE IS FREE TO BE A DOCTOR AGAIN

1204
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
IF HE GETS LICENSED ONCE MORE.

1205
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
AND AGAIN, THE ONLY THING THAT

IN THE NEW YEAR.

1209
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
>> THAT'S JUST EXTRAORDINARY.

1210
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
WE'LL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW IT.

1211
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
THANK YOU.

MYSTERY WITH A TWIST.

1214
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
DOLPHINS ARE TURNING UP DEAD

1215
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000

1216
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000

HERE HE COMES.

1221
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOUR
DOCTOR DOING YOUR JOB,

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000

SO WHY ARE YOU DOING HIS?

1225

ONLY YOUR DOCTOR CAN DETERMINE
IF YOUR PERSISTENT HEARTBURN

IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING
MORE SERIOUS

1227
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
LIKE ACID REFLUX DISEASE.

1228
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
OVER TIME, STOMACH
ACID CAN DAMAGE

1229
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000

1234
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT THE
RISK FOR OSTEOPOROSIS-RELATED

1235
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
BONE FRACTURES AND
LOW MAGNESIUM LEVELS

AND ABDOMINAL PAIN.

1239
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
OTHER SERIOUS STOMACH
CONDITIONS MAY STILL EXIST.

1240
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
LET YOUR DOCTOR DO HIS JOB.

1241
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
AND YOU DO YOURS.

1242
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
ASK IF NEXIUM IS RIGHT FOR YOU.

YOUR MEDICATION,
