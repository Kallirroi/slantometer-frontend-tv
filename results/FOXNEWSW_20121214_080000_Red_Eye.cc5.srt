>> Dana: I WAS ON A HORSE.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
THEY DRUGGED THE HORSE SO THEY

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
WOULDN'T MOVE AND THEY WERE

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
STUFFED.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
RODEO CLOWN, I LOVE THEM.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
THEY WEAR SUSPENDER, TOO.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
>> Eric: LIKE "THE FIVE."

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
>> YOU'RE OUR RODEO CLOWN.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
>> Eric: I'LL DO IT.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
CAN I SAY IT?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
WE ARE PROBABLY ON

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
"THE INSIDER."

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
BEFORE "ENTERTAINMENT

YOU'RE 100% RIGHT.
CHECK IT OUT.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
PEOPLE THAT I WILL BE ON A BUS

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
>> SURE.

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
>> IS THAT THE ACTUAL SIZE OF

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
THE BUS?

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
>> I WOULD LAUGH HYSTERICALLY

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
IF THAT QUESTION HADN'T BEEN

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
ASKED 20 TIMES ALREADY.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
>> REALLY?

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
OH, THEN I I AM NOT THE ONLY

POSSIBILITY.

103

>> THE ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
YES.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
>> YOU ARE TERRIBLY RIGHT.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
>> ACTUALLY THE BUS IS SMALLER

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
THAN THIS.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
>> SHOULD WE RESPECT THEIR

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
LACK OF RESPECT?

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
AN ARMY HANDBOOK IS ADVISING

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
AMERICAN SOLDIERS NOT TO SPEAK

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
ILL OF THE TALIBAN OR SPEAK UP

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS IN

AFGHANISTAN.
THE PROPOSED DOCUMENT OBTAINED

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
BY THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL"

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
LINKED THE LACK OF SAVY TO

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
DEADLY UHING TAYS NOTING THAT

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
MANY OF THE CONFRONTATIONS

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
OCCURRED BECAUSE OF IGNORANCE

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
OR LACK OF EMPATHY FOR MUSLIM

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
AND/OR AFGHAN CULTURE RARE

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
NORMS.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
CULTURAL NORMS.

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
IT IS RESULTING FROM THE

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
AFGHAN SECURITY FORCE MEMBER.

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
>> HOLD YOUR TONGUE WHEN THEY

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
TREAT WOMEN WORSE THAN CHRIS

128
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
BROWN DOES.

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
AND THE HANDBOOK CAUTIONS

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
DON'T MENTION HOMOSEXUALITY.

131
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
NOT EVERYONE AGREES.

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
SPEAKING OF DISAPPROVAL, LOOK

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ANDY LEVY

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
TRIES TO LEAVE HIS APARTMENT.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
JAY NICE JEANS, ANDY.

136
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
SOUNDS WEIRD IN HIS

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
APARTMENT.
>> SHERROD, SHOULD OUR

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
SOLDIERS BE MORE LIKE YOU AND

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
CULTURALLY SENSITIVE TO THE

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
TALIBAN?
>> YES, THEY SHOULD BE.

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
MIND YOUR BUSINESS.

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
YOU ARE NOT THERE TO DO A

143
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
ONE-MAN JOB AND CHANGING THEIR

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
MINDS AND FEELINGS ABOUT

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
THINGS.

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
DO YOUR JOB AND KEEP YOUR HEAD

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
DOWN.

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
>> I DON'T KNOW, HARRIS.

149
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
THE FACT IS SHOULD WE LOOK

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
AWAY AT HOW THEY TREAT WOMEN?

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
THEY THROW ACID IN WOMEN'S

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
FACES AND THEY SHOOT WOMEN FOR

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
ADULTERY.
>> THEY ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE.

154
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
>> I CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.

155
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

156
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
ORIGINALLY AND ALL ALONG I

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
THOUGHT WE WERE IN FACT

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
SHERROD CHANGING HEARTS AND

159
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
MINDS.

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
HOW DO YOU DO THAT IF YOU

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
CAN'T CHANGE WHO YOU ARE?

162
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
WE HAVE SEEN WITH LONG-TERM

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
CONFLICTS THAT THIS KIND OF

164
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
BONDING AND SHARED CULTURAL

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
EXPERIENCE IS IMPORTANT WHEN

166
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
YOU ARE GOING TO BE THERE FOR

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
A LONGTIME.

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
FOR CIVILIANS WHO ARE OPEN TO

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
IT.

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
>> IT MAKES ME THINK I AM NOT

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
INTERESTED IN WINNING HEARTS

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
AND MINDS.

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
MAYBE WE SHOULD HIGH TALE IT

174
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
OUT OF THERE.

175
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
>> NO, YOU CAN WIN WITH HEARTS

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
AND MINDS.

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
YOU CAN PLAY GAMES WITH THE

178
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
KIDS.

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
>> WHAT MOVIES HAVE YOU SEEN?

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
ABOUT HOMO SEXUALITY.

182
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
>> TEACHERS AND THEM

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
BASKETBALL AND FOOTBALL.

184
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I DIDN'T SAY FRIED CHICKEN

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
WITH THEM.

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
>> PATRICK, GO AHEAD.

187
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
>> HE DIDN'T.

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
>> THE ONLY CONCERN THAT THIS

189
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
IS FROM IS THAT THESE AFGHAN

190
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
TROOPS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
BE HELPING ARE SHOOTING OUR

192
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
GUYS.

193
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
THAT'S WHAT STARTED THIS.

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
AND SO NUMBER ONE IF THIS IS

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
GOING TO HELP PREVENT THAT,

196
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
THEN LET THE BRASS DO IT.

197
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
NUMBER TWO, YOU ARE RIGHT.

198
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
WHO ARE OUR FRIENDS HERE?

199
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
WE HAVE FRIENDS AND ALLIES

200
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
THAT ARE SHOOTING US.

201
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
WE HAVE ISRAEL OUR FRIEND AND

202
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
ALLIES THAT SAY THEY ARE ON

203
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
OUR END.
IT IS A BIGGER ISSUE.

204
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
>> IT IS LIKE FRIENDS HOW YOU

205
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
CONSIDER PEOPLE FRIENDS ON

206
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
FACEBOOK.

207
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

208
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
>> IT IS NOT LIKE FRIEND,

209
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
FRIENDS.

210
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
>> WE WERE STATIONED THERE

211
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
WITH MY DAD.

212
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT WE TAKE

213
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
THE ACTUAL LESSONS LEARNED

214
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
FROM CONFLICTS AND THEN APPLY

215
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THEM.

216
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
WHAT I UNDERSTAND WITH THIS

217
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
THOUGH IS THAT THE MANUAL HAS

218
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
TO BE GONE OVER BY GENERAL

219
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
ALLEN.

220
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE

221
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
END WILL BE.

222
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
>> VERY GOOD POINT AND WAY TO

223
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
ADD INFORMATION INTO THE STORY

224
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
THAT I WASN'T AWARE OF.

225
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
>> OKAY, SORRY.

226
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
>> I AM THE HOST HERE.

227
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I AM SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE I

228
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
AM IN CONTROL.

229
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
BILL, YOU SERVED, BUT IT WAS

230
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
AT APPLEBY'S.

231
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
DO YOU HAVE ANY OPINION ON

232
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
THIS WHAT SO EVER?

233
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
>> YES, CLEAN UP YOUR TABLES.

234
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I AM A TABLE BUSKER.

235
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
THE GUM AND ALL OF THAT STUFF,

236
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I AM NOT GETTING PAID ENOUGH.

237
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
WE POOL OUR TIPS.

238
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
SECONDLY IF YOU WANT TO WIN
THE HEARTS AND MIND OF THE

239
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
TALIBAN YOU DECAPITATE THEM.

240
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
REACH INTO THE HEAD HOLE AND

241
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
PULL OUT THE MIND.

242
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
YOU GO INTO THE AORTA CAVITY

243
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
AND PULL OUT THE HEART.

244
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
MIND, HEART, WE WON.

245
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
SECOND OF ALL, THE PROBLEM

246
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
WITH THIS IS THEY ARE NOT JUST

247
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
TALKING ABOUT THE TALIBAN.

248
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT REGULAR

249
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
AFGHANISTAN, PEOPLE.

250
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE FIGHTING

251
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
FOR?

252
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I HAVE TO WONDER IF THE ALLIES

253
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
WERE GOING TO GERMANY WERE

254
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
THEY GETTING PAMPHLETS THAT

255
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
SAID, DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT

256
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
THE JEWS.

257
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

258
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I THINK PATRICK IS CORRECT

259
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR

260
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
TROOPS SAFE.

261
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
BUT IF YOU MADE A PARALLEL

262
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
COMPARISON LIKE BILL DID, THE

263
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
ASSUME USION IS YOU WOULD TURN

264
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
A BLIND EYE TO ANTI-SEMITISM

265
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
OR WORSE, KILLING JEWS.

266
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THE ONLY ANSWER IS GET THE

267
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
HELL OUT OF THERE OR DO

268
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
SOMETHING.

269
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

270
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
>> I GO BACK TO THE CENTER

271
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
FOREARM ME LESSONS LEARNED WHO

272
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
WROTE THIS MANUAL OUT OF FORT

273
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
LEAVENWORTH.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD WIN

274
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
A LONG-TERM CONFLICT WITHOUT

275
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
MAKING FRIENDS.

276
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
DIFFERENT THAN THOSE ON

277
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
FACEBOOK.

278
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
>> YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD WIN

279
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
OVER FRIENDS?
DROPPING DVD'S OF "FRIENDS."

280
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
>> ROSS AND CHANDLER.

281
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
>> THEY LOVE WESTERN CULTURE.

282
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
NO THEY DON'T.

283
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
YOU KNOW WHAT BOTHERS ME THE

284
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
MOST?

285
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
FEMINISTS AND BETA MALES WHO

286
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
SPEND THEIR TIME ON BLOGS

287
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
GOING AFTER SEXIST BEHAVIORS

288
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
LIKE FRATERNITIES OR WALL

289
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
STREET.

290
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
STUFF LIKE THAT.
OH LOOK AT THESE GUYS.

291
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
THEY NEVER SAY ANYTHING ABOUT

292
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
THE STUFF THAT IS GOING ON
OVER THERE.

293
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
THEY ARE BAD STUFF.

294
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
>> I LIKE BETA MALES.

295
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
>> YOU ARE NOT A BETA MALE.

296
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
>> NO.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT A BETA MALE

297
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
IS.
>> IT IS THE OPPOSITE OF ALPHA

298
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
MALE.
>> AND SHERROD WANTS TO

299
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
TEACHERS AND OUR WONDERFUL

300
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
SPORT.
LOOK AT THEIR SPORT.

301
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
IT IS POLO WITH A GOAT'S

302
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
HEAD.
THERE IS A BIG DIVIDE.

303
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
>> YOU WORK WITH WHAT YOU

304
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
HAVE.

305
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
>> THEY DO THAT ONCE A YEAR

306
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
THOUGH.

307
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
JAY WE HAVE THE SUPER BOWL --

308
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
>> WE HAVE THE SUPER BOWL ONCE

309
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
A YEAR.
>> I WANT THEM TO -- YOU KNOW,

310
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
YOU CAN REALLY BOND WITH

311
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
PEOPLE JUST BEING NORMAL WITH

312
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
THEM.

313
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
>> THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO BLOW

314
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
YOU UP.

315
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
>> I KNOW YOU WANT TO MOVE ON,

316
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
BUT THESE ARE SOLDIERS AND

317
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
MARINES.

318
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
WE WANT THEM TO BE -- WE WANT

319
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
THEM TO BE SAFE, BUT WE WANT

320
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
THEM TO FIGHT OUR WARS AND GET

321
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
OUT.

322
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
AT THE POINT WE TEACHERS TEACH

323
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
THEM DIPLOMACY WON'T THEY TAKE

324
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
OVER?
>> IT IS HARD TO SLAM DUNK A

325
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
BALL WHEN THE VERTEBRAE IS

326
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
STILL ATTACHED.

327
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
>> I DON'T THINK HE SAID

328
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
THAT.
>> WE USED TO PLAY GOAT

329
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
BASKETBALL IN OUR FAMILY.

330
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
>> WE FINISHED THIS TOPIC.

331
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
>>> FROM MANUALS TO MANGERS

332
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
THEY ARE FOCUSING ON BULLIES

333
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
IN ASSISTED OF BLITZEN.

334
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
A SCHOOL HAS CAN -- CANCELED

335
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
ITS HOLIDAY CONCERT AND

336
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
REPLACED IT WITH AN

337
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
ANTI-BULLYING CONCERT.

338
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
PUBLIC SCHOOLS ADMIT SOME
PARENTS COMPLAINED ABOUT THE

339
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
RELIGIOUS CONTENT OF THE

340
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
SHOW.

341
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
BUT SHE DENIES THE REASON WHY

342
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
THEY ARE FORE GOING THE

343
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
FA-LA-LA'S FOR THAT REASON.

344
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
WE JUST HAD A LITTLE CHANGE AT

345
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
THAT PARTICULAR SCHOOL BECAUSE

346
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
THEY HAD A BIG INITIATIVE ON

347
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
ANTI-BULLYING.

348
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
BUT SOME TOWN RESIDENTS DON'T

349
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
SEE IT THAT WAY WITH ONE

350
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
WRITING, EVERYTHING THESE DAYS

351
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
HAS TO BE POLITICALLY

352
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
CORRECT.
WHAT IS THIS WORLD COMING TO

353
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
WHEN THIRN CANNOT PUT ON A

354
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
CHRISTMAS PLAY?

355
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TO

356
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
INDEED?

357
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
THE NEW SHOW'S THEME WILL BE

358
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
PEACE, FRIENDSHIP, KINDNESS,

359
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
BE GOOD TO YOUR FELLOW

360
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
STUDENTS AND ACCEPT

361
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
DIFFERENCES AND BE

362
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
SUPPORTIVE.
>> BOO.

363
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
>> SOMETIMES I THINK WE ARE

364
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
LOWERING THE BAR.

365
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I WANT TO ASK YOU, HARRIS, THE

366
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
ANTI-BULLY SEMINARS ARE

367
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
BECOMING THE SECULAR

368
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
CHRISTMAS.

369
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
IT IS EXCLUSIVELY FUN FOR

370
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
CHRISTIANS.

371
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
YOU CAN'T SAY THEY ARE BAD,

372
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
AND THEY AFFECT EVERYBODY,

373
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
EXAMINE IT IS LIKE A SECULAR

374
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
REPLACEMENT.

375
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
>> ONE, THE BULLIES WIN AGAIN

376
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
IF YOU TAKE AWAY CHRISTMAS.

377
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
>> WE DID IT Y'ALL!

378
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
>> RIGHT?

379
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I MEAN, I LIKE THE IDEA OF

380
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
TEACHING KINDNESS AND PEACE,

381
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
BUT THEN WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST

382
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
PUT THAT PROGRAM ON IN

383
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
DECEMBER?
THEY KNOW THEY ARE NOT RIGHT

384
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
IN THIS CASE.
WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS JUST

385
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
KILLING THE PROGRAM.
THEY ARE NOT REPLACING IT.

386
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
THEY ARE KILLING IT.
THEY ARE RUNNING A PROGRAM

387
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
LATER IN JANUARY DURING THE

388
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
CELEBRATION OF MARTIN LUTHER

389
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
KING'S BIRTHDAY.

390
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
THEY WANTED A REASON TO KILL

391
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
CHRISTMAS.

392
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
THIS WAS A LITTLE PIECE THAT

393
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
KILLED ME.
INDIVIDUALS WHO OBJECTED TO

394
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
THE RELIGIOUS NATURE OF A

395
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
CHRISTMAS PROGRAM SHOULD JUST

396
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
STAY HOME.

397
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
AMEN.
WHY NOT JUST STAY HOME IF YOU

398
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
DON'T WANT YOUR KID THERE?

399
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
WHY KL CHRISTMAS FOR

400
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
EVERYBODY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

401
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
YOU ARE DOING.

402
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
OTHERWISE YOU WOULD SIMPLY

403
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
REPLACE IT.
>> LET'S TAKE THE FIRST STORY

404
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
AND COMPARE IT WITH THE SECOND

405
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
STORY.
YOU HAVE THE AMERICAN

406
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
GOVERNMENT SAYING YOU CAN'T

407
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
TALK ABOUT HOMOSEXUALS OR

408
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
WOMEN OR PEDOPHILES OVER

409
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
THERE.

410
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
WE WILL RESPECT THAT.

411
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
OVER HERE IN OUR COUNTRY

412
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
CHRISTMAS IS A BAD THING.

413
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

414
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
CHRISTMAS -- THE BIRTH OF

415
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
CHRIST IS HISTORICALLY

416
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
ACCURATE AND IT ACTUALLY

417
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
HAPPENED.

418
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
WHAT EVER YOU BELIEVE ABOUT

419
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
CHRIST IS A DIFFERENT THING.

420
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
IF WE ARE TOLERANT ABOUT

421
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
PEOPLE'S BELIEFS IT IS A

422
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
HISTORICALLY ACCURATE THING

423
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
THAT HAPPENED.

424
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
WHY ARE WE SO TOLERANT OF

425
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
THOSE GUYS, BUT WHEN IT COMES

426
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
TO OUR THING IT IS LIKE, WE

427
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
CAN'T DO IT.
WE ARE NOT TOLERANT.

428
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
>> IT IS NOT LIKE WE ARE

429
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
TALKING ABOUT EASTER, THE

430
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
RESURRECTION.

431
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
>> A BUNNY?

432
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
>> NO, SWEETHEART.

433
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
AND I JUST SAY SWEE HEART

434
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU OR I WOULD

435
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
PUNCH YOU.

436
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
>> IF IT WAS ANYBODY ELSE YOU

437
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
WOULD PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE.

438
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
>> ARE YOU RIGHT, IT IS THE

439
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
DATE ON THE CALENDAR.

440
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
>> IT IS CH RI ST-MAS.

441
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
>> EVERYBODY IS SO AFRAID OF

442
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
PISSING SOMEBODY ELSE OFF THEY

443
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
WILL RUIN IT FOR EVERYBODY.

444
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
>> I REMEMBER HAVING CHRISTMAS

445
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
PLAYS AND CELEBRATIONS ALL

446
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
THROUGH SCHOOL.

447
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
NOBODY SEEMED TO BE ANGRY

448
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
ABOUT IT.

449
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
>> AND THAT WAS THE ONLY THING

450
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
YOU EVER WEPT TO.

451
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
>> I -- EVER WENT TO.

452
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
>> I NEVER WENT TO THE CLASS.

453
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
>> SOME OF THE BIGGEST BULLIES

454
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
ARE ACTORS AND ARE MISSING OUT

455
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
IN THE CHRISTMAS PLAY.

456
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
JUST SAYING.

457
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
>> HOW MANY MORE NEED TO BE

458
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
HURT BEFORE THIS SENSELESS WAR

459
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
ON CHRISTMAS ENDS?
>> SEVEN.

460
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
>> SHERROD, YOU ARE BEING

461
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
FLIPPANT AND EVERYBODY KNOWS
IT IS 12.

462
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
>> HOLIDAYS ARE -- BILL, WERE

463
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
YOU GOING TO ANSWER IT?

464
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
>> WELL, THE MISTAKE THEY MADE

465
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
HERE BY CAN SELLING IT AND

466
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
THEN REPLACING IT WITH
SOMETHING ELSE, IF THEY JUST

467
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
CANCELED IT, A COUPLE PARENTS

468
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE -- MMM.

469
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
AND THEN THEY WOULD SAY OH

470
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
THANK GOD WE DO DON'T HAVE TO

471
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
GO TO THIS THING.

472
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
MY KID IS ANNOYING AS IT IS.

473
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
PUT A COSTUMES ON THEM THAT'S

474
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
EVEN WORSE.
AND THEN THE KIDS WHO DON'T

475
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
HAVE A ROLE AND THE PARENTS

476
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT.

477
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
NO ONE IN MY SCHOOL LIKES THE

478
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
HOLIDAY STUFF.

479
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
THE KIDS DIDN'T LIKE TO DO

480
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
IT.
THE PARENTS DIDN'T LIKE TO

481
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
WATCH IT.

482
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
THE TEACHERS DIDN'T WANT TO BE

483
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
THERE.

484
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
THE ANTI-BULLYING THING IS

485
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
WORSE.
JUST CAN SELL IT AND YOU WON'T

486
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.

487
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
>> IT IS AN ATTACK ON FUN, AND

488
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
IT IS REPLACING FUN WITH A

489
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
DIDACTIC HER NEST NO FUN --

490
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
HER NEST NO FUN KILLER.

491
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
WE ARE ALL AGAINST BULLYING.

492
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
WHEN YOU HAVE A SEMINAR

493
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
EVERYBODY WILL BE LISTENING
GOING, WE KNOW IT IS WRONG, WE

494
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
KNOW IT IS WRONG.

495
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
THERE IS NO REAL STORY OTHER

496
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
THAN BE NICE TO EVERYBODY.

497
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
WE GET IT.

498
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
HOLIDAYS, HOWEVER, ARE

499
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
DECISIVE AND HURTFUL.

500
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
NOT EVERYBODY CAN HAVE THE

501
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
SAME LEVEL OF FUN.

502
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
>> WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A

503
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
NEW HOLIDAY THAT EVERYBODY IS

504
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
INCLUDED IN.

505
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
>> WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

506
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
>> EVERYBODY LIKES PILATES?

507
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
THEY HAVE A PILATES DAY.

508
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
>> IT IS HARD TO DO.

509
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
>> WE HAVE BECOME A COUNTRY OF

510
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
IDEA POLICE.

511
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
IF YOU ARE EXPOSED TO AN IDEA

512
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH, YOU

513
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
MIGHT GET SOMETHING.

514
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
>> BECAUSE IT IS I KILLER.

515
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
>> WE WILL HAVE NOTHING IN A

516
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
COUPLE YEARS.

517
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
>> PEOPLE PREFER NOTHING TO

518
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
SOMETHING.
ON THAT NOTE WE WILL TAKE A

519
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
BREAK.

520
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
COMING UP, IS ONE GROUP TO

521
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
BLAME FOR ALL OF OUR

RIGHT IF THERE WAS NO MORE

WHITE.

527
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
>> AND IT IS A MUSICAL.

528
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
BUT FIRST, CAN GOOGLE MAKE IT

529
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
HARDER TO FIND PORN?

530
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I DON'T KNOW.

534
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
FOR A PRESIDENTIAL GIG?

535
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
THE NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR WAS

536
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
ASKED IF HIS GIRTH WOULD GET

YOU COULDN'T BE PRESIDENT

542

BECAUSE YOU ARE SO HEAVY.

543
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM?

544
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
>> THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

545
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
PEOPLE WATCHED ME THE LAST

546
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
COUPLE WEEKS DURING HURRICANE

548
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE A

549
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
PROBLEM.

550
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
YOU ARE TOO FAT TO RUN.

564
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
SHE SAYS, WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE

565
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
TO PEOPLE WHO SAY --

566
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SAY

567
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
--

568
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
>> WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO

569
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
THEM?

570
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
>> SHE KNOWS HOW TO ASK THE

571
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
QUESTION AND NOT P UT IT ON

572
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
HER.
I LOVE IT.

573
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
>> THIS IS A WOMAN WHO HAS

574
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
BEEN A TALK SHOW HOST FOR MANY

575
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
YEARS AND HAS AN UNUSUAL VOCAL

576
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
DELIVERY.

577
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
SHE IS ASKING A FAT GUY IF HE

578
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
SHOULD BE PRESIDENT, AND SHE

579
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
HAS BEEN A A TALK SHOW HOST OR

580
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
INTERVIEWER FOR 40 YEARS WITH

581
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
AN UNUSUAL VOCAL DELIVERY.

582
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
SEE MY POINT?

583
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
>> NO, I DON'T SEE IT AT ALL.

584
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
>> FIRST OF ALL AS A FAT GUY,

585
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I DON'T THINK I CAN --

586
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
>> ARE YOU NOT.

587
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
>> DON'T YOU DO THAT!  DON'T

588
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
YOU DO THAT!  YOU LOOK GREAT.

589
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
>> I DON'T THINK I SHOULD -- I

590
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
DON'T THINK I SHOULD THROW

591
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
STONES.

592
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
LET'S GET PAST THE QUESTION.

593
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
LET'S GET PAST THE QUESTION.

594
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
THIS IS THE MOST RIDICULOUS

595
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
ANSWER CHRIS CHRISTIE HAS EVER

596
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
GIVEN IN HIS POLITICAL

597
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
CAREER.
HE IS KNOWN FORGIVING STRAIGHT

598
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
TALK.

599
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
HE IS KNOWN FOR JUST SAYING IT

600
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
AS IT IS.

601
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
AND HE GOES, BARBARA, I DON'T

602
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
KNOW.

603
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I DON'T KNOW I'M FAT.

604
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
>> THIS IS LIKE, YOU KNOW THIS

605
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
IS ALMOST LIKE -- GAVIN HAS

606
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
SAID THIS, BUT IT IS AN

607
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
ACHIEVEMENT TO GET LARGE.

608
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
>> DOWN WHERE I AM FROM, THIS

609
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
IS SVELT.

610
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
THIS IS A PRACTICAL THING.

611
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I SPENT FOUR MONTHS ON A BUS,

612
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
AND ONCE YOU GET SECRET

613
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
SERVICE YOU NEVER WALK.

614
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
WHATEVER HIS WEIGHT IS BEFORE

615
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
HE STARTS CAMPAIGNING, THINK

616
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
ADD 50.

617
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
>> THE SECRET SERVICE KEEP YOU

618
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
FROM WALKING?

619
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
>> LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

620
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
THEY PICK YOU UP FROM THE

621
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
FRONT DOOR, AND THEY TAKE YOU

622
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
TO EVENTS.

623
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
THEY PICK YOU UP AND DROP YOU

624
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
OFF AT PLANES.

625
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
YOU STOP WALKING.

626
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
>> THEY DON'T WANT YOU

627
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
APPROACHED.

628
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
LET ME ASK YOU, HARRIS, WHAT

629
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?

630
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
DO YOU THINK IT WAS OFFENSIVE

631
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
FOR HER TO BRING UP HIS

632
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
WEIGHT?

633
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
>> I THINK IT WAS IRRELEVANT,

634
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
ALTHOUGH PEOPLE ARE TALKING

635
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
ABOUT IT.
I WOULD HAVE OWNED IT THEN.

636
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I WOULD HAVE SAID, YOU KNOW,

637
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE HUNGRY.

638
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

639
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
>> BILL, HERE IS MY PROBLEM.

640
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
WE ARE LOSING OUR FAT PEOPLE.

641
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
THERE ARE NONE IN THE PUBLIC

642
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
EYE.
234* THE OLD DAYS THERE WERE

643
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
FAT ROLE MODELS OR ROLL ROLE

644
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
MODELS.

645
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
EVERYBODY KNEW FAT PEOPLE.

646
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
THEY WERE EVERYWHERE, AND THEY

647
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
WERE -- JACKIE FLEA GLEE

648
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
SON -- JACKIE GLEASON.

649
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
>> FATTY ARBUCKLE.

650
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
>> HE WAS A TERRIBLE ROLE

651
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
MODEL.
>> IT IS CALLED MIKE AND

652
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
MOLLY.

653
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
LET'S WATCH A LITTLE MIKE AND

654
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
MOLLY.

655
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
>> YOU THINK IT WAS A

656
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
LEGITIMATE QUESTION?

657
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
>> I THINK IT IS A

658
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
LEGITIMATE -- NO, I DON'T

659
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
KNOW.

660
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO SAYS

661
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
HE CAN'T BE PRESIDENT BECAUSE

662
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
HE IS SO BIG.

663
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I NEVER HEARD THAT.

664
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
>> PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT

665
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
HIS HEALTH.

666
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THIS IS A GUY WHO ON THE

667
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
JERSEY BOARDWALK LAST SUMMER

668
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
BEFORE WE HAD THE AWFUL

669
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
STORMS, LAST SUMMER WAS EATING

670
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
ICE CREAM AND DONUTS AND GOT

671
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
INTO A FIGHT.
REMEMBER THAT?

672
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
>> I LOVED THAT.

673
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
HE FOLLOWED THE GUY.

674
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
>> HE DIDN'T PUT HIS ICE CREAM

675
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
DOWN WHILE HE BLESSED OUT THIS

676
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
PERSON.

677
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
>> THAT IS A GOOD POINT.

678
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
HE WORKED LIKE 20 HOURS EVERY

679
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
DAY DURING HURRICANE SANDY.

680
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
AND YET HE DID NOT LOSE A

681
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
POUND.

682
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
THIS IS DEDICATION OF A LEVEL

683
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I HAVE NEVER SEEN.

684
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
YOU HAVE TO MULTI TASK YOUR

685
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
EATING TO SUCH A DEGREE, I

686
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
DON'T KNOW WHO YOU HE DOES

687
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
IT.

688
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I DO KNOW HE HAS TO HAVE THE

689
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
STICKEST MOST CRUMB-FILLED

690
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
KEYBOARD IN AWFUL GOVERNMENT.

691
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
>> AND THAT'S SEXY.

692
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
>> THERE IS A SERIOUS POINT.

693
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
HE IS A LEADER THAT PEOPLE

694
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
LOOK UP TO, AND HEALTH IS AN

695
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
ISSUE.
HE AND OBAMA WALKING DOWN

696
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
TOGETHER LOOK LIKE AN

697
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
INTERRACIAL NUMBER 10.

698
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
LOOK, NBC'S "BIG LOSER" POE

699
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
LIT CAL EDITION, HUCKABEE DID

700
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
IT.
HE WAS A FAT GOVERNOR AND

701
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
STARTED RUNNING.

702
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
>> AGAIN, HEALTH WAS THE SPARK

703
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
THERE, SO I HAVE READ.

704
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
YOU KNOW WITH GOVERNOR

705
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
HUCKABEE, ONCE HE GETS HIS

706
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
SIGHTS ON SOMETHING HE WILL

707
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
FINISH IT.

708
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
MAYBE GOVENOR CHRIS STEY

709
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE HE NEEDS TO

710
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
DO THAT.
BUT HE SHOULD HAVE ANSWERED

711
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
THE QUESTION HONESTLY.

712
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
YOU KNOW WHAT, BARBARA, WHO

713
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
EVER YOU ARE QUOTING, I AM

714
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
FAT.

715
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I OWN THAT.

716
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I LOVE IT.
MOVE ON.

717
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS

718
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
THINKING ABOUT?

719
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
HOW AWESOME IT IS TO LIE ON A

720
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
BED, AND YOU HAVE THIS REALLY

721
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
HOT, HOT DONUT, AND IT IS LIKE

722
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
ON A CONTRAPTION ABOVE YOU AND

723
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
YOU PUT IN SCOOPS OF ICE CREAM

724
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
AND IT MELTS INTO YOUR MOUTH.

725
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
IT IS ICE CREAM DRIPPING INTO

726
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
YOUR MOUTH AND ALL OVER YOUR

727
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
FACE.

728
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
>> SO YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE

729
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
GOVERNOR'S MANSION.

730
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000

IT IS A COLLEGE-AGE --

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
COLLEGE-AGED FILM.

763
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000

764
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000

>> THANKS, SLEEVE LESS JOE.

766
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000

767
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
>> HE IS WORKING ON A CAR OUT

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
BACK.

769
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
>> HE DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE DHOG

770
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
SHOW TONIGHT.

771
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
-- WE WERE DOING THIS SHOW

772
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
TONIGHT JIE. CASUAL GREG IS

773
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
DIFFERENT THAN REGULAR GREG.

774
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
>> OKAY.

775
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
>> CASUAL GREG CAN HANG OUT

776
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
AND TALK AND RAP AFTER THE

777
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
SHOW.

778
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
>> RAP?

779
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
>> THAT'S WHAT I CALL TALKING

780
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
ABOUT EMOTIONAL AND PERSONAL

781
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
ISSUES.

782
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
>> REALLY?
>> THAT'S WHAT I DO WITH

783
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
KIDS.

784
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
>> I CALL MY OFFICE THE TREE

785
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
HOUSE.

786
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
EE HOUSE.
>> THINGS I DID ON THE BUS.

787
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
>> YOU WERE JUST GIVING THE

788
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
PROSECUTION SO MUCH

789
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
AMMUNITION.

790
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
>> LET'S GET TO IT, SHALL WE?

791
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
PROPOSED ARMY HANDBOOK WOULD

792
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
ADVISE SOLDIERS NO THE TO

793
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
SPEAK ILL OF THE TALIBAN AND

794
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
SPEAK UP FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS.

795
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
SHERROD, YOU SAID IT IS

796
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
TELLING OUR TROOPS THEY ARE

797
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
THERE TO DO A JOB, AND THEY

798
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
SHOULD MIND THEIR BUSINESS
BEYOND THAT.

799
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
THIS IS APPLYING THE

800
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
THANKSGIVING DINNER RULES TO

801
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
AFGHANISTAN.

802
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
>> WHAT IS THE THANKSGIVING

803
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
DINNER RULES?
>> YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT

804
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
CERTAIN THINGS.

805
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
>> YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

806
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
IT IS LIKE BEING AROUND

807
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
FAMILY.
SOME THINGS YOU KEEP IN

808
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
HOUSE.
WHEN YOU HAVE OTHER PEOPLE

809
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
AROUND A THAT AIN'T FAMILY YOU

810
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
TALK REGULAR TALK.
>> WHEN YOU HAVE THE CRAZY

811
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
RACIST UNCLE AT THANKSGIVING

812
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
DINNER, IE ME, THERE ARE

813
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
CERTAIN SUBJECTS YOU DON'T

814
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
BRING UP.
>> THIS RAISES A POINT.

815
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
>> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THANK

816
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
GIVES AND THE TALIBAN,

817
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
ALCOHOL.
>> ONE OF THE REASONS YOU

818
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
CAN'T SAY ANYTHING TO THE

819
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
TALIBAN IS THAT THEY ARE

820
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
ALWAYS SOBER WHICH MAKES THEM

821
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
MISERABLE PEOPLE.

822
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
>> WE NEED TO PUT COCAINE IN

823
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
THEIR WATER.

824
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
>> THEY HAVE DRUGS THERE

825
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
THOUGH.
>> THEY SELL OPIUM.

826
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
>> THAT'S WHAT EVERY DEALER

827
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
SAYS.

828
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
>> UNTIL THEY GET CAUGHT.

829
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
AND THEN IT IS ALL FOR

830
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
PERSONAL USE.

831
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
>> YOU SAID PART OF THE REASON

832
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
WE ARE THERE IS TO SHARE OUR

833
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
VALUES.
AND TO WIN HEARTS AND MINDS.

834
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

835
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
WORKING.

836
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
>> THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

837
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
THE POINT IS THEY DON'T WANT

838
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
IT TO HAPPEN AT ALL.

839
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
IF YOU BLOCK IT IT DOESN'T

840
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
HAVE A CHANCE TO HAPPEN.

841
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
WE DON'T KNOW THAT FOR

842
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
CERTAIN.
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR

843
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
PEOPLE TO BE IN EACH OTHER'S

844
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
COMPANY FOR THE AMOUNT OF

845
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
YEARS THAT OUR TROOPS HAVE

846
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
BEEN ON THE GROUND IN THAT

847
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
COUNTRY AND NOT HAVE SHARED

848
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
SOME SORT OF CULTURAL BACK AND

849
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
FORTH.

850
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
AND IN A VERY GOOD, POSITIVE

851
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
WAY.
I AM AN OPTIMIST, BUT I HAVE A

852
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
DAD WHO SERVED.

853
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU

854
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
HAVE BOOTS ON THE GROUND FOR

855
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
THAT LONG THERE WILL BE SOME

856
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
SHARED EXPERIENCES.

857
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
AND WITH ALL PRAYERS, I JUST

858
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
HOPE THAT WE CAN RUB OFF THE

859
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
GOOD STUFF ON EACH OTHER.

860
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
THEY ARE HUMAN, SO THEY HAVE

861
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
STUFF THEY CAN SHARE WITH US

862
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
TOO.

863
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
AMEN, CAN I GET AN AMEN?

864
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
>> THE FLIP SIDE IS WHEN YOU

865
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
HAVE BOOTS ON THE GROUND FOR

866
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
SO LONG THE PEOPLE START TO

867
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
RECENT YOU.

868
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

869
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
>> THERE IS ALWAYS A SEGMENT

870
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
OF THE POPULATION THAT CAN

871
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
OPEN THAT DOOR.
IF YOU BLOCK IT, IF YOU TELL

872
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
OUR TROOPS THAT YOU FORBID IT,

873
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
THEY WILL FOLLOW THAT

874
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
COMMAND.

875
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
>> YOU SAID IF THIS WILL KEEP

876
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
OUR SOLDIERS SAFE, THEN YOU

877
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
ARE FOR IT WHICH I AGREE

878
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
WITH.

879
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
BUT IS THE FACT THAT WE NEED

880
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, DOES THAT

881
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
MEAN IT IS TIME TO GET OUT?

882
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
>> I THINK THAT IS THE

883
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
PROBLEM.

884
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
LIKE I SAID BEFORE WE ARE

885
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
MAKING OUR TROOPS INTO

886
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
DIPLOMATS.

887
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
>> BILL, YOU WERE CORRECT WHEN

888
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
YOU SAID THIS IS NOT JUST
ABOUT THE AT THAT .

889
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
THIS IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO

890
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ON OUR SIDE

891
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMS LIKE A

892
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
LOT OF THEM ROBERT.

893
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
>> AS PATRICK SAID, BOY THIS

894
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
IS FUNNY.

895
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
>> PATRICK, IT IS LIKE JAZZ.

896
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
SOMETIMES THE HUMOR IS IN WHAT

897
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I DON'T SAY.

898
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
>> I AM LAUGHING ON THE

899
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
INSIDE.
>> THAT'S A SWEET, SENTIMENTAL

900
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
THOUGHT.
>> THAT'S CRAP IS WHAT IT IS.

901
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
HARRISON, CENTER FOREARM ME

902
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
LESSONS LEARNED, WHAT IT DOES

903
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
IS RAPIDLY COLLECTS AND

904
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
ANALYZES AND ARCHIVES THE

905
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
OPERATIONAL RECORDS IN ORDER

906
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
TO FACILITATE INITIATIVES AND

907
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
CONDUCT FOCUS, KNOWLEDGE AND

908
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
FORMS THE ARMY AND ENABLES THE

909
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
OPERATIONALLY BASED INGNAW

910
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
GRACIOUS AND INTEGRATION

911
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
THROUGHOUT THE ARMY AND IN THE

912
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
JIM ENVIRONMENT.
>> AND ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO

913
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
KNOW --

914
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
>> WHY DO YOU HATE THE

915
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
MILITARY, GREG?

916
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
WHY DO YOU HATE THE MILITARY

917
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
AND MILITARY PROGRAMS THAT ARE

918
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
SET UP TO MAKE OUR ARMY

919
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
BETTER?
WHY SIR?
>> WOW.

920
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
>> HE IS THINKING ABOUT IT.

921
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
>> THAT'S THE CENTER THAT

922
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
WROTE THE JOURNAL.

923
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
THE ONLY BUDS MAN IS TRYING TO

924
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
SHOW US.
>> YOU NEED TO DRILL DOWN,

925
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
HARRIS.

926
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
>> IT IS A NEWSCHANNEL.

927
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
>> YOU REALIZE THE HOST IS NO

928
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
LONGER TALKING.

929
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
>> I WOULD SAY THAT WAS MY

930
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
SECONDARY PURPOSE.

931
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
BUT IT WAS MY PRIMARY.

932
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
>> JOB WELL DONE.

933
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
>> THEY REPLACE THE CHRISTMAS

934
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
CONCERT WITH ANTI-BULLYING

935
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
PROGRAM.

936
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
HARRIS, YOU SAID THE BULLIES

937
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
WIN AGAIN IF THEY TAKE AWAY

938
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
CHRISTMAS.

939
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
THEY ARE NOT TAKING AWAY

940
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
CHRISTMAS.

941
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
THEY ARE CAN SELLING A

942
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
CONCERT.

943
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
>> THEY ARE SAYING THEY ARE

944
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
NOT GOING HAVE IT THAT WAY.

945
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
THEY DIDN'T REPLACE IT.

946
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
A MONTH LATER THEY ARE GOING

947
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
TO DO THE BULLY PROGRAM.

948
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
IT IS NOT LIKE THEY PHYSICALLY

949
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
PUT SOMETHING IN PLACE.

950
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I GUESS YOU WOULDN'T ENJOY AN

951
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
ANTI-BULLYING PROGRAM.
>> TO ME IT IS ANOTHER WAY

952
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
THEY WILL DESTROY THE ARTS IN

953
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
SCHOOLS.

954
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
MORE THAN A CHRISTMAS PLAY IS

955
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
A PLAY.

956
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
ONE OF MY FAVORITE TIMES IN

957
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
SCHOOL.

958
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
GREECE, WE DID GREECE IN

959
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
THE -- GREASE, WE DID GREECE

960
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
-- GREASE IN MY CLASS.

961
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
AND I WAS KINICKI.

962
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
>> CAN YOU DO THAT?

963
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
>> I NEED THE WIG.

964
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
>> I PLAYED RIZZO AND I DIDN'T

965
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
NEED THE WIG OF THE.

966
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

967
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
>> PATRICK, I DIDN'T REALLY

968
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
UNDERSTAND OR AGREE WITH YOUR

969
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
ARGUMENT, YOU SAID SOMETHING

970
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
ABOUT BECAUSE JOE SUCCESS WAS

971
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
A HISTORICAL FIGURE.

972
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO

973
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
WITH WHAT CHRISTMAS

974
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
CELEBRATES.

975
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
IT IS CELEBRATING THE BIRTH OF

976
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
THE SON OF GOD.

977
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
>> BUT THE POINT IS, THERE IS

978
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
A HISTORICALLY RELEVANT

979
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
COMPONENT TO THAT FOR

980
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
NONCHRISTIANS.

981
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
PEOPLE WHO DO NOT CLAIM TO BE

982
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
CHRISTIANS OR ARE NOT

983
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
CHRISTIANS THEIR EYES WILL NOT

984
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
BURN OUT OF THEIR HEAD BY

985
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
WATCHING SOMETHING THAT DOES

986
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
THAT.

987
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
>> JESUS IN A MANGER.

988
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
>> BUT THE ENTIRE POINT OF

989
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
CHRISTMAS IS THAT JESUS IS THE

990
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
SON OF GOD.

991
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
IT IS NOT THAT HE WAS A MAN.

992
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
>> THE POINT OF CHRISTMAS,

993
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
JESUS THE SON OF GOD WAS BORN

994
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
THAT DAY.

995
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
>> RIGHT, EXACTLY.

996
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
THE SON OF GOD.

997
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I'M CONFUSED.

998
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
>> YOU ARE TRYING TO HAVE A

999
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
FIGHT ABOUT JESUS CHRIST.

1000
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
>> I AM NOT HAVING A FIGHT

1001
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
ABOUT IT.

1002
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I THINK IT IS DISINGENERAL

1003
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
WISE TO PRETEND THAT CHRISTMAS

1004
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
IS ABOUT THE BIRTH OF A

1005
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
HISTORICAL FIGURE.

1006
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
>> I AM NOT SAYING THAT AT

1007
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
ALL.
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

1008
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
ARGUING AGAINST THIS AND AS

1009
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
ONLY YOUR RELIGIOUS THING, I

1010
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
THINK THAT IS DISINGENERAL

1011
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
WISE IS THEY KNOW NOBODY CAN

1012
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
LOOK AT CHRISTMAS BECAUSE OF
THE BIRTH OF CHRIST.

1013
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
>> IT IS A RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY.

1014
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
>> BUT IT IS SOMETHING PEOPLE

1015
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
CAN LEARN FROM.

1016
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
IT IS NOT IMPOSING VALUES ON

1017
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
ANYBODY.

1018
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
>> I HEAR WHAT YOU ARE TRYING

1019
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
TO SAY.
ANDY, THIS IS SOMETHING YOU

1020
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
CAN LEARN FROM.

1021
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
DO YOU CATCH MY MEANING?

1022
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
WHY DON'T YOU COME TO SERVICE

1023
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
WITH ME THIS YEAR.

1024
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
>> IT IS NOT TOO LATE.

1025
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
>> SHERROD, YOU CAN'T HAVE A

1026
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
PILLA TEASE DAY.

1027
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
>> THAT WAS PONTIOUS PILOT.

1028
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
CHRIS CHRISTIE TELLS BARBARA

1029
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
WALTERS THAT HE IS NOT TOO

1030
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
FAT.
I THOUGHT IT WAS FANTASTIC

1031
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
WHEN SHE SAID THERE ARE PEOPLE

1032
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
WHO SAY.

1033
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
BUT OTHERS SAY THAT IS A

1034
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
CHEESY JOURNALISTIC PRACTICE.

1035
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
>> IT STILL WORKS.

1036
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
THEY ARE STILL MAKING THE BIG

1037
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
MONEY.

1038
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
>> I AGREE.

1039
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
>> HARRIS, YOU SAID IF

1040
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
GOVERNOR HUCK UH KEY -- HUCK

1041
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
UH BE WANTS TO GET HIS SIGHTS

1042
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
ON SOMETHING HE FINISHES IT.

1043
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
COULDN'T YOU SAY THE SAME

1044
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
THING ABOUT GOVERNOR CHRISTIE

1045
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
AND A BUCKET OF CHICKEN?

1046
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE LIKES

1047
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
OTHER THAN DONUTS AND ICE

1048
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
CREAM.

1049
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
IF HE DECIDED HE WANT TO DO

1050
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
SOMETHING ABOUT HIS WEIGHT, HE

1051
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
WOULD DO IT.

1052
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
>> YOU ARE PROBABLY RIGHT.

1053
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
>> HE SHOULD HAVE SAID THIS.

1054
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I AM FINE THE WAY I AM.

1055
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
IF I GET TO A POINT WHERE I

1056
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
CAN CHANGING IT, I CHANGE IT.

1057
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
HE NEEDS TO REFER TO HIMSELF

1058
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
AS 2PHAT WHERE THE 2 IS THE

1059
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
NUMBER AND THE PHAT WITH A

1060
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
P-H.

1061
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
YOU GET THE TWO CHAINS AND THE

1062
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
OLD SCHOOL PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU

1063
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
HAVE PHAT WITH A P-H.

1064
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
>> THE KIDS WANT TO CALL THEM

1065
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
FATTY BOOM BOOM.

1066
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
>> IT WAS NOT THE FACT OF HIS

1067
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
WEIGHT, BUT THE ANSWER TO THE

1068
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
QUESTION.
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT GOT THIS

1069
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
WAY.

1070
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
>> IS IT NOT POSSIBLE HE WEPT

1071
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
TO BED ON A THURSDAY AND WAS

1072
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
IN PERFECT SHAPE AND THEN WOKE

1073
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
UP FRIDAY AND WAS HUGE.

1074
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
>> YOU THINK IT IS IMPOSSIBLE,

1075
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE IT

1076
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
IMPOSSIBLE.

1077
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I HAVE SEEN WEIRDER THINGS.

1078
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000

1124
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
BACK THEN -- IT WAS HARD TO

1125
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
FIND PORN.
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS REWARDED IF

1126
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
HE FOUND IT.

1127
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000

00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
NOT A JOKE.

1139
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
