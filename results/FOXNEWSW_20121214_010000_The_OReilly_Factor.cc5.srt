THANKS FOR WATCHING US

TONIGHT.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
SECULAR FORCES ON THE MARCH,

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
EVENING'S TALKING POINTS MEMO.

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
AS WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING,

60
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
SOME COMMITTED LEFT WING

61
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
AMERICANS HAVE BEEN EMBOLDENED

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
BY THE RE-ELECTION OF
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
YOU ARE SEEING THAT NOW IN THE

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS AS THE

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
PRESIDENT AND HIS SIDE ARE NOT

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
IN ANY COMPROMISING MOOD.

67
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I SAW IT FIRSTHAND THIS WEEK

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
WHEN I WAS DOWN IN WASHINGTON.

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
THERE IS ARROGANCE AND

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
CONDESCENSION IN MANY LEFT

71
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
WING PRECINCTS DESPITE THE

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
FACT THAT U.N. AMBASSADOR

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
TODAY SUSAN RICE IS OUT OF

74
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
CONSIDERATION FOR SECRETARY OF
STATE.

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
WE WILL MORE ON THAT WITH BOB

76
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
BECKEL COMING UP.

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
THE MORE SECULAR PROGRESSIVES

78
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
UNDERSTAND NOW IS THEIR TIME

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
IN HISTORY.
THE AGENDA IS CLEAR.

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
ABOVE ALL THE SECULAR FORCES

81
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
WANT TO CHANGE THE ECONOMY.

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
THEY WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO

83
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
RUN IT AND PROVIDE GRADDLE TO

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
GRAVE ENTITLEMENTS FOR THOSE

85
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
AMERICANS WHO CANNOT OR WILL

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
NOT PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES.

87
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
THE LEFT ALSO WANTS TO CONTROL

88
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
PROFITS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
TAKING AS MUCH MONEY AS

90
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
POSSIBLE AWAY FROM THE

91
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
ACHIEVERS AND THE

92
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
CORPORATIONS.
AGAIN, WITH THE INTENT TO

93
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
REDISTRICT THE CASH.

94
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
SO THAT'S AGENDA NUMBER ONE.

95
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
NUMBER TWO, IS TO OBLITERATE

96
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
SOME AMERICAN TRADITIONS.

97
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
GAY MARRIAGE, NOT ABOUT

98
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
MATRIMONY ANYMORE.
IT'S ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS.

99
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
AND IF YOU OPPOSE GAY MARRIAGE

100
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
YOU ARE A HATER, A RIGHTS

101
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
DENIER.
LEGALIZED NARCOTICS, THE LEFT

102
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
SEES DRUG USERS AS VICTIMS AND

103
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
BELIEVES NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO

104
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
STAND BETWEEN AN AMERICAN AND

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
INTOXICATION MUCH.
ON THAT NOTE THE "NEW YORK

106
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
TIMES" RAN A FRONT PAGE

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
ARTICLE YESTERDAY LAMENTING

108
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
TOUGH MANDATORY PRISON

109
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
SENTENCES FOR DRUG DEALERS.

110
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
THE LEFT BELIEVES THEY ARE NOT

111
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
VIOLENT OFFENDERS.

112
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
SO IF YOU ARE SELLING METH,

113
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
HEROIN, COCAINE, THAT'S NOT AN

114
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
ACT THAT CAUSES HARM OR PAIN

115
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
TO ANOTHER PERSON, OH, NO.

116
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

117
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW

118
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
FIRSTHAND ABOUT ADDICTION KNOW

119
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
HOW CRAZY THAT POINT OF VIEW

120
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
IS.

121
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
PEOPLE WHO SELL DRUGS ARE THE

122
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
LOWEST RUNG.
THEY ARE COMMITTING VIOLENCE

123
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
AGAINST OTHER HUMAN BEINGS.

124
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
PERIOD.

125
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
"TIMES" ARTICLE SAYS A HALF

126
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
MILLION PEOPLE ARE IN PRISON

127
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
FOR DRUG OFFENSES IN THE

128
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
U.S.A.
10 TIMES THE NUMBER THAN IN

129
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
1980.
THAT SOUNDS BAD, DOESN'T IT?

130
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
WHAT THE PAPER DOES NOT, DOES

131
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
NOT TELL YOU IS THAT VIOLENT

132
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
RHYME IN -- CRIME IN AMERICA

133
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
HAS BEEN CUT IN HALF SINCE THE

134
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
TOUGH MANDATORY PRISON

135
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
SENTENCES WERE INSTITUTED.

136
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
THE COUNTRY IS MUCH SAFER

137
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
BECAUSE HARD CORE CRIMINALS
ARE DOING HARD TIME.

138
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THAT'S A FACT.

139
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
NO ONE SHOULD FEEL SORRY FOR

140
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
KILLERS, RAPISTS AND DRUG

141
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
PUSHERS.
NOW, BECAUSE I DO COMMENTARY

142
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
LIKE THIS, LAYING OUT THE

143
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
PROGRESSIVE AGENDA, I'M A BIG

144
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
THREAT TO THEM.

145
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
LISTEN TO THIS INCREDIBLE

146
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
SOUND BITE FROM COMMITTED LEFT

147
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
WING GUY HARRY BELL BELAFONTE

148
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
HE SAYS PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO

149
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
OPPOSE PRESIDENT OBAMA AND

150
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
LIBERAL AGENDA ON SOME THINGS

151
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
SHOULD BE DEALT WITH.

152
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
>> WHAT FASCINATES ME IS THAT

153
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
IN THE PHASE OF MILLIONS OF

154
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
AMERICANS EXPRESSING THEIR

155
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
DESIRE THE WHOLE POLITICAL

156
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
ESTABLISHMENT DEFINING ITS

157
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
GAME THAT THERE SHOULD BE THIS

158
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
LINGERING INFESTATION OF

159
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
REALLY CORRUPT PEOPLE WHO SIT

160
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
TRYING TO DISMANTLE THE WISHES

161
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
OF THE PEOPLE, THE MANDATE

162
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO BARACK

163
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
OBAMA AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT

164
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
MORE THEY WANT.

165
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR BARACK

166
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
OBAMA TO DO IS TO ORGANIZE A

167
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THIRD WORLD DICTATOR AND PUT

168
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
ALL THESE GUYS IN JAIL.

169
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
VIOLATING THE AMERICAN DESIRE.

170
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
>> Bill: I GUESS VIOLATING THE

171
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
AMERICAN DESIRE IS A FELONY

172
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
NOW, RIGHT, HARRY?

173
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
MAYBE THE GUY WAS JUST

174
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
KIDDING.
MAYBE.

175
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
BUT, BELIEVE ME, ANYONE IN

176
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
THIS COUNTRY WHO CHALLENGES

177
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
THE SECULAR PROGRESSIVE AGENDA

178
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
IS GOING TO GET HAMMERED.

179
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
THESE PEOPLE ARE ON A MISSION.

180
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
THEY WANT A COMPLETELY

181
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
DIFFERENT AMERICA.
A COUNTRY THAT EMBRACES SOCIAL

182
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
JUSTICE, LIBERTINE BEHAVIOR

183
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
AND SECULAR IN EVERY WAY.

184
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
THAT BRINGS US TO THE

185
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
CHRISTMAS CONTROVERSY WHICH IS

186
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
SYMBOLIC, SYMBOLIC OF THE

187
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000

THINGS BUT.

372
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
>> Bill: HE SHOULD WRITE WHAT
HE BELIEVES IS TRUE BUT IF HE

373
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

374
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
BETWEEN CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY
AND THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION AND

375
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
MOST PEOPLE DON'T.

376
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
NOT MOST PEOPLE BUT A LOT OF

377
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
PEOPLE DON'T.

378
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
>> THEY DON'T, EARTH THAT.

379
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS.

380
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
YOU FOUGHT THE GREAT BATTLE,

381
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
YOU WON THE BATTLE, LET'S MOVE

382
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000

IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE YOU

383
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

384
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
>> Bill: I'M NOT GOING TO MOVE

385
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
ON.

386
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
IT'S SYMBOLIC OF THE CULTURE

387
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000

YOU DON'T BELIEVE SECULAR.

391
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000

AMERICANS?
SO SECULAR AMERICANS ARE NOT

393
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
TRADITIONAL AMERICANS?

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE

395
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
SUGGESTING.
>> Bill: NO THEY WANT CHANGE.

SECULAR PROGRESSIVES WANT TO

397
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
CHANGE THE COUNTRY.

398
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
>> IT'S MIND BOGGLING TO ME.

399
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
>> Bill: IT'S MIND BOGGLING.

400
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
>> YEAH YOUR RADIO COMMENTARY

401
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
FOR EXAMPLE WAS BEYOND BELIEF.

402
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
GAY MARRIAGES.

403
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
DO YOU KNOW THAT A MAJORITY OF

404
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
AMERICANS FAVOR GAY MARRIAGE.

405
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
>> Bill: I DON'T OPPOSE GAY

406
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
MARRIAGE I'M NOT SAYING THAT

407
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'M SAYING IT'S A ISSUE

408
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
DEFINED AS CIVIL RIGHTS.

409
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
>> YOU SAY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

410
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE.

411
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
>> NOT MAJORITY.

412
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
>> HALF THE COUNTRY.

413
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
>> PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE IT ARE

414
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
MOSTLY BLACK

415
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.
>> Bill: YOU ARE MEANDERING

416
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
HERE NOW.

417
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000

SECULAR PROGRESSIVES HAVE BEEN

421
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
EMBOLDENED BY THE RE-ELECTION

422
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
OF PRESIDENT OBAMA.

423
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
WE HEARD FROM HARRY BELAFONTE

424
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
CALLING FOR INCARCERATION.

425
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
>> I WILL TELL YOU ONE THING

426
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
THAT WOULD BE A START.

427
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
>> YOU WOULD LOVE THAT?

428
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
YOU WOULD RUN WILD WITH THAT.

429
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
HARRY BELAFONTE WAS JOKING.

430
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
>> Bill: HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

431
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I DIDN'T SEE HIM SMILING, DID

432
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
YOU?
>> IF YOU TOOK THAT SERIOUSLY.

433
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
>> Bill: HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT

434
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
HE WAS JOKING?

435
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
HOW?
>> HE LAUGHED.

436
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
>> Bill: HE DIDN'T LAUGH.

437
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
>> THE OTHER GUY INTERVIEWED

438

>> Bill: THE OTHER GUY LAUGHED

439
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
BECAUSE IT WAS SO INSANE.

440
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
>> YOU THINK HARRY BELAFONTE

441
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
WANTS TO LOCK YOU UP?

442
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.

443
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE

444
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
EXERCISE.

445
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
>> Bill: I THINK HARRY

446
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
BELAFONTE WOULD PROBABLY

447
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
EMBRACE ANYTHING THAT WOULD
GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS

448
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
POLITICALLY.
>> CAN WE GO BACK TO WHAT

449
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
PEOPLE WANT POLITICALLY?

450
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
YOU KEEP SAYING THE SECULAR

451
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
LEFT AS IF THE SECULAR LEFT

REPRESENTS MAYBE 2 O% OF THE

453
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
DEMOGRAPHICS OF THIS COUNTRY.

>> Bill: IT'S NOT ABOUT A

464
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
LITTLE TAX HIKE.

465
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
IT'S ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT
TAKING OVER THE ECONOMY.

466
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
THAT'S WHAT SECULAR

467
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
PROGRESSIVES WANT.

468
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000

WAR IN THE COUNTRY.

478
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000

AND THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE

494
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
GOING TO GO.

495
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA IS MAD.

496

>> SHE ASKED IF SHE WAS

537
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
UNFAIRLY TREATED.

>> Bill: SHE DIDN'T CORRECT

539
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000

WOULD SAY WHAT SHE SAID WAS

541
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
THAT?

545
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000

WOULD SAY.

546
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I HOPE SHE COMES ON HERE.

557
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000

BOB BECKEL SAYS.

606
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
HOW SHOULD INDIVIDUAL

607
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
AMERICANS REACT TO THAT ON

608
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
BOTH SIDES?

ALL RIGHT, YOU HEARD MY

611

GO.

614
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000

616
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
BECKEL'S HEAD IN A DEVICE AND

617
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
SQUEEZE IT?

618
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
WHAT'S GOING ON.
NO PROBLEMS ON CHRISTMAS.

619
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
NO ATTACKS ON RELIGION IN THE

620
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
PUBLIC SQUARE.

621
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
SUSAN RICE WAS TREATED

622
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
UNFAIRLY.
LIVING IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE

623
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
HERE.

624
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
LOOK, I THINK MOST PEOPLE

625
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
REALIZE THAT AFTER THE

626
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
ELECTION AS OFTEN HAPPENS IN

627
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
POLITICS THE SIDE THAT WINS,

628
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
DEMOCRATS FEEL VERY HEADY,

629
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
VERY COCKY.
FEEL LIKE THE COUNTRY HAS

630
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
SHIFTED SO MUCH BOTH

631
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
POLITICALLY AND CULTURALLY

632
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
THAT THEY CAN PUSH THEIR

633
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
ISSUES.
>> AND THEY ARE.

634
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
>> Laura: PUSH MORE BENEFITS

635
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

636
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
TAKE THE FIGHT AGAINST

637
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
RELIGION AND CHRISTMAS.
AND THEY CAN DO A VARIETY OF

638
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
THINGS.
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IN THE

639
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
END, BILL, IS THAT IT'S ALMOST

640
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
ALWAYS OVERREACHING ON THE

641
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
PART OF THE COCKY PARTY, THE

642
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
CONCRETED PARTY.
IN THIS CASE OF COURSE IT'S

643
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
THE DEMOCRATS AND MORE LIBERAL

644
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
DEMOCRATS.
THEY OVERREACH.

645
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
AMERICA KIND OF BRISTLES AND

646
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
THE PEOPLE INVARIABLY WILL SAY

647
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
WOE WOE WOE WOE WOE, MAYBE WE

648
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
DIDN'T LIKE ROMNEY SO MUCH.

649
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
MAYBE WE WEREN'T THAT EXCITED

650
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
ABOUT HIM BUT WE THARNT

651
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
EITHER.
TAKE IT SLOW.

652
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
LET US LIVE OUR LIVES AND

653
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
DON'T TRY TO PUSH TRADITION

654
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
OUT OF ALL ASPECTS OF THE

655
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
AMERICAN CULTURE.

656
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I THINK DEMOCRATS ARE AT LISK

657
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
OF DOING THAT ONCE AGAIN.

658
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
>> Bill: OKAY.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF I WERE

659
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
A SECULAR PROGRESSIVE.

660
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
>> YEAH.

661
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
AND I WAS ON THAT SIDE I WOULD

662
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
PUT THE PEDAL TO THE METAL THE

663
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
PARTY HAS TO ORGANIZE.

664
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
OLD LEADERSHIP IS OUT, NEW

665
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
LEADERSHIP HAS TO COME BACK
IN.

666
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
RATINGS FOR A LOT OF THE

667
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE ARE DOWN.

668
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
THOSE PEOPLE WHO BACK ROMNEY

669
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
BIG TIME AND SAID WIN THE

670
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
ELECTION PEOPLE HAVE FLED AND

671
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
THEY ARE CONFUSED.

672
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
SO IF I'M A SECULAR

673
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
PROGRESSIVE AND, LOOK, HARRY

674
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
BELAFONTE COMING OUT AND I

675
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
DON'T KNOW WHETHER HARRY WAS

676
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
KIDDING AROUND OR NOT.

677
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I MEAN, HE WASN'T SMILING BUT

678
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
MAYBE HARRY DOESN'T SMILE.

679
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
>> IS HE A COMMITTED LEFTIST.

680
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
>> Bill: BUT WHEN HE SAYS HEY,

681
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
IF YOU DON'T AGREE DESIRE OF

682
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,

683
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
WE HAVE GOT A JAIL CELL FOR

684
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
YOU.

685
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GETTING REALLY

686
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
NOW INTO A PRETTY INTERESTING

687
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
SITUATION.
>> IT'S LIKE JEFFREY IMMELT

688
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
SAYING KIND OF PRAISING CHINA

689
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
RECENTLY BECAUSE THEY CAN MAKE

690
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
SOME GOOD BUSINESS DECISIONS

691
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
FOR THEMSELVES SO THE WHOLE

692
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
SYSTEM MIGHT BE SOMEWHAT ADD

693
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
ADMIRABLE.
I THINK THEY ARE REVEALING

694
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
WHAT THEY IN MANY WAYS REALLY

695
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
THINK.

696
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
IT WASN'T TOO MANY YEARS AGO

697
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

698
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
HARRY BELAFONTE COMMENTS ABOUT

699
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
CONDOLEEZZA RICE AND EVEN

700
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
COLIN POWELL WHEN HE SAID THEY

701
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
WERE LIVING IN THE HOUSE OF

702
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
THE MASTER.

703
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
HE WASN'T JOKING THEN.

704
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
HE MAY BE OVERSTATED A LITTLE

705
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
BIT MAYBE FOR HIM.

706
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
>> Bill: IS HE EMBOLDENED.

707
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
>> OF COURSE.

708
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
>> Bill: NOBODY CARES ABOUT

709
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
HARRY BELAFONTE.

710
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
>> THAT SONG IS IN MY HEAD

711
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
RUINING THE CHRISTMAS SEASON

712
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
BANANA BOAT.

713
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
>> Bill: SUN GOES DOWN. I LIKE

714
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
THAT SONG.

715
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I USED HIM NOT BECAUSE HE HAS

716
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
CREDIBILITY AND THAT IS HE

717
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
SOMEBODY THAT PEOPLE LISTEN

718
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
TO, BUT TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE

719
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
OF WHAT IS BEING SAID IN THE

720
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
SALONS AT THE HUFFINGTON POST.

721
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING, YOU

722
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
KNOW WHAT?

723
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
IF YOU OPPOSE PRESIDENT OBAMA

724
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
NOW AND YOU OPPOSE THE SECULAR

725
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
PROGRESSIVE AGENDA WE'RE GOING

726
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
TO DEAL WITH YOU.

727
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
LOOK, THE ATTACKS ON ME, LOOK,

728
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I HAVE A STACK OF NEWS CLIPS

729
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BECAUSE

730
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
HOW DARE O'REILLY, HOW DARE HE

731
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
STAND IN OUR WAY AND POINT

732
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
THESE THINGS OUT.

733
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
WE'LL GO AFTER HIM ANY

734
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
INSTITUTION OR MEDIA SOURCE

735
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
THAT ACTUALLY EXPOSES WHAT

IN GO TO YOUR RESORT HOTEL.

1100
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
AND GET THE HELL OUT.

1101
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
>> YOU REALLY HAVE TO THINK

1102
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
DON'T BOTHER GOING UNTIL

1103
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
MR. HAMMAR GETS OUT OF PRISON.

1104
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
>> Bill: I DON'T THINK ANYBODY

1105
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
SHOULD GO.
>> THIS GUY SERVES OUR COUNTRY

1106
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
HONORABLY.
HE HAD TO GOES INTO PROST

1107
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
TRAUMATIC STRESS TREATMENT.

1108
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
HIS BUDDIES HAD GOTTEN KILLED

1109
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
DURING SERVICE.
HE GETS OUT OF THAT AND HE

1110
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
GOES JUST TO HAVE A SURFING

1111
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
TRIP.
>> Bill: JUST TO GO DOWN AND

1112
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

1113
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
>> NOT LIKE HE IS TRYING TO

1114
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
PULL A FAST ONE.

1115
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
REGISTERED WITH U.S. CUSTOMS

1116
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
AND THOUGHT MEXICANS SAY

1117
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
THAT'S IT.
YOU ARE ARE GOING TO

1118
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
IMMEDIATELY TO JAIL.

1119
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
HERE IS THE IRONY ABOUT IT

1120
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
WHAT HAS OUR STATE DEPARTMENT

1121
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
DONE?
WE HAVE MADE A FEW PHONE

1122
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
CALLS.
THE PARENTS ARE VERY UPSET

1123
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
THAT THE U.S. CONSULATE HASN'T

1124
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
DONE MORE.

1125
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
TYPICALLY THE WAY THIS WORKS

1126
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
OUR STATE DEPARTMENT CALLS

1127
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
THEIR STATE DEPARTMENT AND

1128
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
FUNNELS DOWN THE LINE UNTIL

1129
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
THEY GET TO THE STATE POLICE

1130
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
AND THEY SAY DON'T BE

1131
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
RIDICULOUS.
THIS ISN'T ONE OF THOSE

1132
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
SITUATIONS WHERE SOMEBODY GOES

1133
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
HIKING OVER AND ACCIDENTLY

1134
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
CROSSES INTO IRAN.

1135
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
THIS IS MEXICO.

1136
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
THAT'S AN ALLY OF OURS.

1137
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
WE GIVE THEM HUNDREDS OF

1138
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR,

1139
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
BILL.
WHY ISN'T IT JUST A PHONE

1140
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
CALL.

1141
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
>> Bill: LET'S BE HONEST THEY

1142
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
DISRESPECT US ALL THE TIME

1143
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
MEXICO.

1144
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
NUMBER ONE, HILLARY CLINTON
SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THIS

1145
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
HERSELF.

1146
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY SIGN OF

1147
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
THAT NUMBER TWO, PRESIDENT

1148
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
OBAMA SHOULD BE INVOLVED WE

1149
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
HAVEN'T SEEN ANY SIGN OF THAT

1150
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
NUMBER THREE, THE NEW MEXICAN

1151
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
PRESIDENT, THERE IS NO WAY

1152
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
THAT THIS GUY SHOULDN'T LET

1153
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
THIS MARINE OUT TOMORROW.

1154
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
CHRISTMAS IS COMING UP.

1155
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
WE CALLED THE MEXICAN EMBASSY

1156
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
TODAY.

1157
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
THOSE PEOPLE ARE TOTALLY

1158
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
CHAOTIC.
>> THEY ARE VERY BUSY.

1159
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
>> THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

1160
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
HELL IS GOING ON.
THEY DON'T CARE.

1161
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
SO I THINK NOW WE ARE GOING TO

1162
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
HAVE TO SQUEEZE.

1163
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
WE WILL HAVE TO PUT PRESSURE.

1164
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
>> HERE IS THE IRONY.

1165
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
LET THE VIEWERS KNOW.

1166
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
SO WE HAVE THIS 1.9

1167
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
BILLION-DOLLAR ASSISTANCE
PROGRAM THAT WE HELP MEXICO

1168
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
WITH TO FIGHT THEIR WAR ON

1169
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
DRUGS, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

1170
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
WE HAVE BEEN SENDING DOWN

1171
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
MONEY FOR BLACKHAWK

1172
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
HELICOPTERS AND SO ON.

1173
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
RECENTLY OUR EFFORT HAS

1174
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
SHIFTED TO MORE OF A LAW AND

1175
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
ORDER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

1176
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
AND WE HAVE HAD THE FORMER

1177
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
DIRECTOR OF COLORADO'S

1178
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
PENITENTIARY SYSTEM HAS

1179
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
TRAINED MORE THAN 5,000

1180
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
MEXICAN PRISON OFFICIALS IN

1181
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
RECENT YEARS.

1182
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
MEXICAN JURY LISTS RUNNING

1183
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
MOCK TRIALS WITH VISITING

1184
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
MEASURE JUDGES WHAT ARE THEY

1185
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
TRAINING FOR?

1186
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
TO TRY OUR MARINE.

1187
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

1188
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
GOING DOWN THERE TO REVAMP OUR

1189
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
LAW AND ORDER SYSTEM AND WHO

1190
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
ARE THEY GOING TO USE IT

1191
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
AGAINST NOT THEIR OWN CARTEL

1192
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
MEMBERS BUT OUR MILITARY.

1193
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
>> Bill: GOING TO BE ON

1194
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
HANNITY AFTER OUR PROGRAM

1195
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
STICK AROUND.

1196
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
WE WILL DO A STORY ON IT

1197
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
TOMORROW.
MEXICAN EMBASSY, AGAIN WE

1198
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
ASKED YOU ALL DAY LONG TO

1199
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
COMMENT.
YOU ARE HIDING.

1200
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
YOU CAN'T CONTINUE TO HIDE.

1201
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
HILLARY CLINTON, YOU KNOW

1202
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
WHAT?
YOU HAVE GOT TO GET INVOLVED.

1203
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
ALL RIGHT, MS. SECRETARY?

1204
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
YOU HAVE GOT TO GET INVOLVED.

1205
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
THAT'S IT.

1206
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
AND IF PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TO
GET INVOLVED, HE HAS TO GET

1207
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
INVOLVED.
THIS IS A MARINE CORPS PATROL.

1208
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
THIS IS AN AMERICAN FOUR

1209
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
MONTHS FOR NOTHING.

1210
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
>> HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

1211
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
WRONG.
>> Bill: THAT'S IT.

1212
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
>> HE IS FACING UP TO 12 YEARS

1213
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
IN PRISON.

1214
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
ESSENTIALLY.

1215
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
>> Bill: IS HE GOING TO GET
OUT SOON.

1216
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I HAVE CONFIDENCE THE NEW

1217
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
PRESIDENT OF MEXICO IS GOING

1218
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

1219
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
>> THEY ARE CALLING THE

1220
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
PARENTS FROM THE JAIL AND
TRIED TO EXTORT THOUSANDS OF

1221
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
DOLLARS.

1222
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
>> Bill: OF COURSE, THAT'S
WHAT THEY DO.

1223
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
>> HAD TO MOVE TO SOLITARY

1224
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
CONFINEMENT.
THEY SAY HE HAS BEEN CHAINED

1225
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
TO THE BED.

1226
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
APPARENTLY WE WERE ABLE TO

1227
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING.

1228
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
>> Bill: ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

1229
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
SENATOR BOB MENENDEZ FROM NEW

1230
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000

1231
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
IMMIGRANT WHO WAS IN THE

1232
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
COUNTRY, AN INTERN IN THE

1233
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, ALL RIGHT?

1234
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
>> RIGHT.

1235
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
>> Bill: AND A REGISTERED SEX

1236
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
OFFENDER TO BOOT.

1237
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
PICK IT UP.

1238
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
>> WELL, THEN, THAT INTERN

1239
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
JUST GOT ARRESTED.

1240
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
IS HE ONLY A YOUNG KID.

1241
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
IS HE 18 YEARS OLD.

1242
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
HE GOT ARRESTED.

1243
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
>> Bill: DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE

1244
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
SEX CHARGE IS AGAINST HIM?

1245
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
BECAUSE IT WAS SEALED?

1246
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
>> JUVY REGISTER AS A SEX

1247
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
OFFENDER.
I'M CONFUSED ABOUT THIS CASE

1248
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
IT HAPPENED HERE IN THE UNITED

1249
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
STATES.

1250
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
AND YET WHY WAS HE STILL HERE?

1251
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
>> Bill: BECAUSE THEY DON'T

1252
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
DEPORT PEOPLE.

1253
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
YOU KNOW.
