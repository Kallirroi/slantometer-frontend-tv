>> THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A

561
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000

603
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH REVENUE TO

MAKE UP FOR IT.

605
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
WE HAVE A SPENDING PROBLEM,

10:00 P.M. EASTERN.

617
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
WHY SECRETARY OF STATE CLINTON

618
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
IS NOT TESTIFYING ABOUT BENGHAZI

619
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
THIS WEEK.
IT SAYS POLITICS MAKES STRANGE

620
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
BED FELLOWS.

621
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
CASE IN POINT ENERGY EXPORTS

622
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
NEXT.
COPD makes it hard
to breathe,

623
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
but with ADVAIR,
I'm breathing better.

624
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So now I can be in
the scene.

625
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
ADVAIR is
clinically proven to help

626
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
significantly improve

627
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
lung function.

628
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Unlike most COPD medications,

629
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
ADVAIR contains both an
anti-inflammatory

630
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and a
long-acting bronchodilator

631
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
working together to help improve
your lung function all day.

632
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
ADVAIR won't
replace fast-acting inhalers

633
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
for sudden symptoms

634
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and should not be used more
than twice a day.

635
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
People with
COPD taking ADVAIR

636
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
may have a higher chance
of pneumonia.

637
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
ADVAIR may increase your
risk of osteoporosis

638
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
and some eye problems.

639
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Tell your doctor
if you have a heart condition

640
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
or high blood pressure before
taking ADVAIR.

641
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
If you're still
having difficulty breathing,

642
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
ask your doctor if including
ADVAIR could help

643
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
improve your lung function.

THE BOTTOM LINE IS CLINTON HAS

00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
ANSWER FOR THEM.

923
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I AS A NRA MEMBER BELIEVE ENOUGH

924
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
IS ENOUGH.
WE ALL NEED TO COME TO THE TABLE

925
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
AND END UP WITH APPROPRIATE

926
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
RESTRICTIONS.

927
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
T

928
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
OO THE BIG QUESTION IS WILL

929
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
THERE BE THE VOTES?

930
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
FOR 20-YEARS THIS ISSUE DOES

931
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
NOTHING BUT LOSE AN ELECTION.

932
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
THEY CHANGE THEIR MIND ON THIS

933
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
THERE WILL BE A SEAT CHANGE.

934
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
YOU ARE SEEING SOMETHING

935
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HAPPENED IN

936
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
THE WAKE OF AURORA AND INDIANA.

937
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
CLOSE TO 50 PERCENT OF PEOPLE

938
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
THINK THERE SHOULD BE MORE

939
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
RESTRICTIONS ON GUNS.

940
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
PAST TRAGEDIES HAVEN'T MADE THAT

941
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
CHANGE IN PUBLIC OPINION.

942
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
>> CHARLES?
>> I UNDERSTAND THIS REFLECTS A

943
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
MOVE TO DO THIS.

944
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
IN PRINCIPAL I AM NOT OPPOSED TO

945
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
IT.

946
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
WE A DECADE WITH AN ASSAULT

947
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
WEAPONS BAN IN THE MID 90s

948
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
LASTED FOR A DECADE.

949
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
IF YOU LOOK AT THE STUDIES HAD

950
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
NO AAPPRECIATEABLE INFLUENCE ON

951
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
GUN VIOLENCE.

952
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
THERE ARE THREE ELEMENTS IT'S

953
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
THE SHOOTER, IT'S THE WEB AND

954
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
THE ENVIRONMENT.

955
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
THE MAIN THING YOU WANT TO LOOK

956
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
AT IS THE WEAPON.

957
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF LOOKING

958
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
AT THIS.

959
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHOOTER

960
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
HIMSELF THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE

961
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
THE FACT THAT YOU CANNOT GET A

962
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
COMMITMENT ON THESE KINDS OF

963
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
PEOPLE I AM THINKING MOSTLY OF

964
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
JARED LOUGHNER EVERYBODY KNEW HE

965
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
WAS A GRENADE READY TO GO OFF.

966
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
EVERYBODY SAID THAT.

967
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
YOU COULD ONLY STOP HIM AFTER HE

968
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
KILLED.
WE MOVED RAD DE TO MAKE IT

969
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

970
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
DANGEROUS.
THAT HAS TO BE ON THE TABLE AND

971
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
THERE'S ALSO HOLLYWOOD WITH THE

972
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
DE SENSE TIESZATI-- DE SENSEZAT

973
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
VIOLENCE.
THEY MAKE IT UBIQUITOUS.

974
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
YOU CAN IMAGE THIS KID AUTISTIC

975
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
PLAYING THESE GAMES WHERE YOU

976
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
MOW PEOPLE DOWN WITHOUT

977
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
CONSEQUENCE.
I CAN UNDERSTAND OBAMA SPEAKING

978
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
TO THE NRA.

979
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
IS HE GOING TO SPEAK TO THE ACLU

980
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
ON COMMITMENT AND SPEAK TO

981
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
HOLLYWOOD ON AT LEAST VOLUNTARY

982
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
CURTAILMENT OF THE OBSCENE

983
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE IN THEIR

984
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
PRODUCT?
>> BESIDES THE DEMOCRATS

985
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
SPEAKING OUT ABOUT CHANGING

986
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
THEIR POSITIONS WE HAVE HEARD

987
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
ABOUT GUN ADVOCATES PUBLICLY.

988
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
WE HEARD LEWEY ON FOX NEWS

989
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
SUNDAY WHO MADE A CASE -- WELL

990
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

991
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
>> ONCE YOU START DRAWING THE

992
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
LINE WHERE DO YOU STOP?

993
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
THE FACTS ARE EVERY TIME GUNS

994
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
HAVE BEEN ALLOWED, CONCEAL CARRY

995
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
HAS BEEN ALLOWED THE CRIME RATE

996
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
HAS GONE DOWN.

997
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
WASHINGTON, D.C. AROUND US OUGHT

998
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
TO BE THE SAFEST PLACE IN

999
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
AMERICA AND IT'S NOT.

1000
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
CHICAGO OUGHT TO BE SAFE IT'S

1001
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
NOT.
THEIR GUN LAWS DON'T WORK.

1002
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
>> SO THIS DEBATE, I MEAN WE ARE

1003
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
GOING TO SEE A BIG DEBATE.

1004
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
>> YOU WILL SEE A IN FAVOR OF

1005
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
LESS MASS KILLINGS.

1006
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
YOU HAVE SEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

1007
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
THIS SIMPLE NARRATIVE IN

1008
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
WASHINGTON WHERE IT IS THE NRA

1009
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
AND BIG LOBBIES AND BLOCK ANY

1010
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
PROGRESS OR ANY DISCUSSION OR

1011
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
A

1012
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
THESE ISSUES.
IT IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN

1013
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
THAT.
WHAT MATTERS HERE THE DETAILS

1014
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
REALLY DO MATTER.

1015
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
WHAT KINDS OF WEAPONS ARE YOU

1016
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
CONSIDERING BANNING?

1017
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
WHAT LEADS TO AN ATROCITY LIKE

1018
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
THIS ONE?

1019
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
PART OF THE REASON WE HAVEN'T

1020
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
HAD THE KIND OF CONSENSUS WE

1021
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
HAVE BEEN SEEKING IS WE DON'T

1022
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
AGREE ON WHAT THOSE STEPS SHOULD

1023
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
BE.
MACHINE GUNS HAVE BEEN ILLEGAL

1024
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
SINCE 1934.

1025
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
IT HAS BEEN ILLEGAL TO SELL OR

1026
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
MANUFACTURER AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

1027
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
NO ONE CAN TELL YOU OR GIVE YOU

1028
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
A STRAIGHT DEFINITION OF WHAT

1029
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC ACTUALLY MEANS.

1030
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
>> LET ME READ WHAT SENATOR FINE

1031
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
STEIN'S BILL SAYS.

1032
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
STOP THE SALE TRANSFER

1033
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000

SPECIFICALLY AIMED FIREARMS AS

1035
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
WELL AS CERTAIN SEMIAUTOMATIC

STYNES OFFICE.

1040

>> 900 SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF

1041
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
WEAPONS.
THERE WAS SOME AGREEMENT ON

1042
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
POTENTIALLY LIMITING THE SIZE OF

1043
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
MAGAZINES.
THAT IS THE ONE AREA WHERE YOU

1044
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
HEAR GUN ADVOCATES AND GUN

1045
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
CONTROL FOLKS WITH SOME

1046
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
AGREEMENT OR AT LEAST THE

1047
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
BEGINNINGS OF SOME AGREEMENT.

1048
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
>> BUT I MEAN THIS BILL AS YOU

1049
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
ARE LOOKING AT IT, THIS BILL

1050
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
COULD IT PASS?

1051
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
>> I THINK IT COULD PASS BY SOME

1052
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
VERSION OF IT.

1053
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
JOE MANCHIN SAID THIS MORNING HE

1054
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
JUST CAME BACK FROM DEER

1055
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
HUNTING.
HE NEVER PUTS MORE THAN 3 CLIPS

1056
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
IN HIS RIFLE.

1057
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
WHY DO YOU NEED THE MASSIVE

1058
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
AMOUNTS OF AMMUNITION.

1059
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON TO MOW

1060
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
PEOPLE DOWN.

1061
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
>> THE QUESTION IS WILL IT DO

1062
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
ANYTHING?

1063
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
THE BILL LOOKS ALMOST LIKE THE

1064
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
ONE THAT PASSED IN 1994 WHICH

1065
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
WAS IN PLACE FOR 10 YEARS AND

1066
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
HAD NO EFFECT.

1067
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
PART OF THE REASON WAS IT

1068
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
ALLOWED AS THIS DOES PEOPLE TO

1069
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
KEEP THE PWEAPONS THEY ALREADY

1070
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
HAVE.
IC THERE ARE 24 MILLION OF THESE

1071
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
MAGAZINES.
IT WOULD TAKE 100 YEARS SUPPLIES

1072
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
WOULD BE EXHAUSTED.

1073
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
AUSTRALIA ACCOMPLISHED IT.

1074
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
THEY HAD BANS ON ANYTHING YOU

1075
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
COULDN'T HAVE WHAT YOU ALREADY

1076
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
HAD.
YOU HAD TO SELL IT THE

1077
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
GOVERNMENT COULD BUY IT.

1078
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
IF YOU HAD ONE AFTER THAT YOU

1079
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
WERE RAISED AND IT WORKED.

1080
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
DO YOU THINK IN THIS COUNTRY WE

1081
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
WOULD STAND FOR IT.

1082
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
>> AUSTRALIA ONLY HAD 7 PERCENT

1083
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
GUN OWNERS.

1084
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
>> IF SHE HAS THIS EXCEPTION IT

1085
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IN THE

1086
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
REAL WORLD BUT EVERYBODY FEELS

1087
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
GREAT.
>> HOLD ON.
I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE

1088
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
FISCAL CLIFF BUT THE SECOND

1089
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
PANEL WE HAVE MORE TO TALK ABOUT

1090
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
HERE.
I HAVE AN INTERESTING QUESTION

1091
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
FROM A VIEWER WHO WROTE IN AND I

1092
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT.

1093
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
STAY TUNED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

1094
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
THIS BREAK.

1095
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
WERE

1096
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000

QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND WE

1098
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
BRING THEM TO YOU.

1099

>> IN SOME WAYS IT'S LIKE THE

1105
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
CLASSIC QUESTION POSEED BY THE

1106
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
HOLOCAUST FOR EXAMPLE.

1107
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
THRO
WROTE THE BOOK AFTER THE

1108
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
HOLOCAUST SAYING THE ONLY

1109
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
APPROPRIATE ANSWER IS SILENCE.

1110
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY IN

1111
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
WORDS THAT WILL BE ADEQUATE TO

1112
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
THE TASK IN SOME WAYS DIMINISHES

1113
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
JUST BY SPEAKING ABOUT IT.

1114
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
THAT'S ALWAYS THE PROBLEM.

1115
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
ON THE OTHER HAND SILENCE IS NOT

1116
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
AN ANSWER THAT SOCIETY CAN

1117
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
ACCEPT.
IT HAS TO TALK ABOUT IT.

1118
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
IT HAS TO DISCUSS IT.

1119
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
AND IN CASES WHERE IT'S NOT ONLY

1120
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
IN THE PAST BUT IT MAY LIE IN

1121
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
THE FUTURE THESE KIND OF MASS

1122
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
KILLINGS YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT

1123
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
IT BECAUSE OF THE POLITICS, WHAT

1124
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
YOU CAN DO.

1125
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
SO I DO AGREE WITH THE VIEWER IN

1126
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
SOME SENSE THAT THERE IS AN OVER

1127
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
EMPHASIS AND THE BLANKET

1128
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
COVERAGE IS PERHAPS TOO MUCH.

1129
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
PEOPLE SAY WHAT DO WE TELL OUR

1130
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
CHILDREN.
YOU CAN SHUT OFF THE MEDIA SO IT

1131
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
DOESN'T HAVE TO INVADE THE LIFE

1132
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
OF A 3-YEAR-OLD, A 6-YEAR-OLD, A

1133
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
9-YEAR-OLD LIVING IN A DIFFERENT
PART OF THE UNITED STATES BUT IN

1134
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
THE END IT WILL PENETRATE

1135
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF

1136
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
GLOBAL CULTURE WE LIVE IN.

1137
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
IF IT'S GOING TO LET'S TALK

1138
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
ABOUT IT AND BE REASONABLE ABOUT

1139
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
SOLUTIONS THAT MIGHT WORK.

1140
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
>> NONSTOP COVERAGE.

1141
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
>> EVERYTHING THE MEDIA DOES IS

1142
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
TOO MUCH.

1143
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
ALMOST EVERYTHING THE MEDIA

1144
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
DOES.
IN ANY EXTREME COVERING ANY KIND

1145
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
OF HORRIBLE VIOLENT OR EXTREME

1146
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
SYSTEM.

1147
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
THERE'S TOO MUCH MEDIA.

1148
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
>> THERE ARE 24-HOURS A DAY,

1149
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
THERE'S 24 CHANNELS TEST ON THE

1150
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
INTERNET.
THERE ARE THINGS PEOPLE CAN

1151
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
UNDERSTAND AND RELATE TO THEY

1152
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT.

1153
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I SYMPATHIZE WITH THE VIEWER.

1154
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO

1155
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
ABOUT IT.

1156
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
YOU HAVE TO MOURN APPROPRIATELY

1157
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO TO

1158
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS FROM

1159
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE.

1160
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
BUT I THINK THAT RESPECT FOR THE

1161
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
FAMILIES IS THE BOTTOM LINE

1162
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
HERE.
>> I THINK FOR ME THE QUESTION

1163
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
IS NOT THAT IT IS BEING COVERED

1164
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
BUT HOW IT IS BEING COVERED.

1165
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I REMEMBER BACK IN JOURNALISM

1166
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000

1167
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
IN ORIGINAL REPORTING IN ONE

CLASS.

1169
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
ONE OF THE ASSIGNMENTS WAS TO GO

1170
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
OUT AND FIND IN THE NEWSPAPER

1171
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000

1172
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
JUST BEEN KILLED OR JUST DIED

1173
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
AND SET UP AN INTERVIEW.

1174
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I SAID I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT

1175
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
PARTICULARLY FOR A JOURNALISM

1177
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000

1183
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
SO ANGRY AT THE REPORTERS WHO

1184
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
WERE THERE ALL OF THE TIME.

1185
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
