1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
SOMETHING THAT DEFINES US, BUT

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US TO BE

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
BETTER, TO BE MORE COMPASSIONATE

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
AND MORE HUMBLE PEOPLE.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
>> A FATHER, A FAMILY, A

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
COMMUNITY IN GRIEF.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
THEIR HEARTS ARE HEAVY.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
WEARY OF THESE TRAGEDIES.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'M DON LEMON.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
>>> GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'M JOHN BERMAN.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
>> I'M KATE BOLDUAN.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
WE'RE LIVE IN NEWTOWN,
CONNECTICUT.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
>>> PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL BE

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
COMING HERE LATER TODAY.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
HE WILL MEET WITH SOME OF THE

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
VICTIMS' FAMILIES AND SPEAK AT A

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
VIGIL BEING HELD HERE TONIGHT.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
MEANWHILE, WE'RE LEARNING MORE

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
ABOUT THIS TRAGEDY AND THE

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
VICTIMS, 20 CHILDREN, 6 ADULTS

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
DIED IN FRIDAY'S SHOOTING AT THE

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
>> EVERYBODY'S DEATH WAS CAUSED

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
BY, EVERYONE THAT WE COMPLETED

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
SO FAR WAS CAUSED BY GUNSHOT

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
WOUNDS.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
AND, OBVIOUSLY, THE MANNER OF

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
DEATH ON ALL THESE CASES HAS

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
BEEN CLASSIFIED AS HOMICIDE.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
>> THAT WAS THE MEDICAL

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
EXAMINER.
HE ALSO OFFERED THIS DISTURBING

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
DETAIL.
ALL OF THE VICTIMS HE'S SEEN,

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
THEY WERE SHOT MORE THAN ONCE.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
>> JUST AMAZING TO EVEN HEAR HIM

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
RECOUNT WHAT HE'S SEEN IN REALLY

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
CHILLING, CHILLY DETAIL, TOM.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
>> WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE ON THE

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
VICTIMS.
OF COURSE, THEIR NAMES AND THEIR

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
STORIES COMING UP IN JUST A FEW

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
MINUTES.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY ARE

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
STILL COMING TO GRIPS WITH THIS

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
TRAGEDY.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
UNDERSTANDABLY, WE SAW MORE

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
VIGILS HERE LAST NIGHT AND

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
THEY'RE STILL OFFERING GRIEF

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
COUNSELING TO MANY.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
THAT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
THE KIDS WHO LOST SO MANY OF

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
THEIR FRIENDS IN THIS SHOOTING.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
WE ALSO WANT TO PASS THIS ALONG

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
TO YOU.
THE UNITED WAY HAS SET UP A

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000

WE ARE ALSO HEARING FROM ADAM

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
LANZA'S FAMILY.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
BOTH HIS BROTHER, RYAN, AND HIS

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
FATHER HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED BY

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
POLICE.
PETER LANZA RELEASED THIS

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
STATEMENT.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
"OUR FAMILY IS GRIEVING ALONG

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
WITH ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
AFFECTED BY THIS ENORMOUS

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
TRAGEDY.
WE ARE IN A STATE OF DISBELIEF

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
AND TRYING TO FIND WHATEVER

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
ANSWERS WE CAN.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
WE TOO, ARE ASKING WHY."

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
WE'RE HEARING FROM ADAM LANZA'S

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
AUNT WHICH SAYS SHE'S SHOCKED

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
AND OFFERS A LITTLE INSIGHT INTO

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
WHY.
>> I KNOW SHE HAD ISSUES WITH

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
SCHOOL.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
SHE WOUND UP HOMESCHOOLING HIM,

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
BECAUSE SHE BATTLED WITH THE

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
SCHOOL DISTRICT I'M NOT SURE IN

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
WHAT CAPACITY.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
>> HAS HE ACTED OUT?

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
HAD SHE SHARED WITH YOU?

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
>> NO.
>> NO VIOLENCE TOWARDS HER?

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
>> NO.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
IF HE DID, I KNOW SHE WOULDN'T

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
HAVE TOLERATED IT.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
>> JOINING US NOW NATIONAL

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
CORRESPONDENT SUSAN CANDIOTTI.

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
INVESTIGATION FROM THE VERY,

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
VERY BEGINNING.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
WHAT MORE ARE WE LEARNING ABOUT

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
ADAM LANZA AND WHAT HE WAS DOING

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE SHOOTING?

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
>> OF COURSE, THAT'S ONE OF THE

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
MANY KEY QUESTIONS THAT

99
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
AUTHORITIES ARE TRYING TO FIGURE

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
OUT.
AS WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE MORE

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
PHOTOGRAPHS EMERGE OF THIS

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
20-YEAR-OLD YOUNG MAN, OF

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
COURSE, THE PHOTOS WE'VE SEEN OF

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
HIM ARE AT A VERY MUCH YOUNGER

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
AGE.

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
DP

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
AGAIN, HE WAS ONLY 20, BUT A LOT

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
OF THE PHOTOS WERE TAKEN WHEN HE

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
WAS JUST A TEENAGER.

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN CHASING

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
DOWN A LOT OF LEADS IN THIS

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
AREA.

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING TO

114
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND NEIGHBORS

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
TO TRY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HIM

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
AS AN INDIVIDUAL AND, AGAIN,

117
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
WHERE HE WAS IN THE DAYS BEFORE

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
THE SHOOTING.

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE BEEN

120
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME, JOHN AND

121
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
KATE, AT VARIOUS GUN RANGES AND

122
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
GUN SHOPS IN THE AREA.

123
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
AGAIN, CHASING DOWN INFORMATION

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
THAT HE MAY HAVE VISITED SOME OF

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
THESE PLACES.

126
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
AND ONE OF THE STOPS TOOK THEM

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
TO A LOCAL SPORTING GOODS STORE.

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
IT'S A CHAIN AND IT'S LOCATED IN

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
DANBURY, CONNECTICUT.

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
SOMEONE MAY HAVE PURCHASED A GUN

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
THERE, POSSIBLY HIM ON TUESDAY,

132
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
BUT DECIDED AGAINST IT.

133
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
THEY SPENT A LOT OF TIME THERE

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
TALKING TO EMPLOYEES AND EVEN

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
TRACKING DOWN THE STORE'S

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA VIDEOS TO

137
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
SEE IF THEY CAN CAPTURE HIM ON

138
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
TAPE, BUT THAT TIP DID NOT PAN

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
OUT.
WE UNDERSTAND THAT AUTHORITIES

140
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
HAVE PLANS TO KEEP DOING THAT

141
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
TODAY.
JOHN?

142
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
>> AND, SUSAN, ARE WE GETTING

143
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
ANY SENSE OF ANY NEW INFORMATION

144
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
OF REALLY WHAT TRANSPIRED AT THE

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
SCHOOL FRIDAY MORNING AND THE

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
IMPOSSIBLE QUESTION IS REALLY,

147
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE YET

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
POINTING TOWARDS A MOTIVE?

149
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
>> OH, THE MOTIVE, NO.

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
WE'VE BEEN ASKING THAT, AGAIN

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
AND AGAIN.

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
WE DID HEAR FROM INVESTIGATORS

153
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
SAYING THAT THEY ARE PICKING UP

154
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
WHAT THEY CALL VERY IMPORTANT

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
EVIDENCE TO TRY TO FIGURE THAT

156
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
OUT AT BOTH THE CRIME SCENE AND

157
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
AT THE HOME THAT THE SHOOTER

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
SHARED WITH HIS MOTHER.

159
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
BUT THEY'RE NOT REVEALING WHAT

160
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
THEY CONSIDER TO BE THAT

161
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
IMPORTANT EVIDENCE.

162
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
WE DO KNOW THIS, THAT THE THREE

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
GUNS THAT HE TOOK THERE, GUNS

164
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
THAT WERE LEGALLY PURCHASED,

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES BY HIS

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
MOTHER, THOSE THREE GUNS WERE

167
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
FOUND NEXT TO HIS BODY,

168
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
INCLUDING ONE THAT HE KILLED

169
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
HIMSELF WITH.

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
THEY KNOW WHICH ONE THAT WAS,

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
BUT THEY'RE NOT SAYING.

172
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
REMEMBER, HE TOOK WITH HIM TWO

173
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
HANDGUNS AND A LONG GUN CALLED A

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
BUSHMASTER.
WE KNOW FROM THE MEDICAL

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
EXAMINER THAT HE USED THAT LONG

176
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
GUN TO KILL A NUMBER OF HIS

177
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
VICTIMS, AS YOU INDICATED

178
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
EARLIER, KATE, WE KNOW THAT HE

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
SHOT MANY OF THIZ VICTIMS

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
SEVERAL TIMES, ACCORDING TO THE

181
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER, ANYWHERE FROM

182
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
3 TO 11 TIMES EACH.

183
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
JUST A VICIOUS, COLD BLOODED

184
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
EVENT THAT AUTHORITIES HAVE

185
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
CALLED BEING BLAMED ON SOMEONE

186
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
WHO WAS VERY, VERY EVIL AND WE

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
CAN UNDERSTAND WHY.

371
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
RAN DOWN THE HALLWAY AND THEY'RE

372
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
ONE OF THE CLOSEST ROOMS TO THE

373
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
MAIN ENTRANCE AND AIDEN WAS, HAD

374
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO HOLD THE

375
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
DOOR FOR ONE OF HIS CLASSMATES

376
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
AND THEN ANOTHER ONE OF HIS

377
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
CLASSMATES THAT WAS A LITTLE

378
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
BEHIND AND WAITED FOR HIM AND

379
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
THEN THEY ALL RAN TO THE ROAD,

380
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
TO THE MAIN ROAD.

381
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
>> DO YOU THINK HE KNOWS SHE

382
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
DIDN'T MAKE IT?

383
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
>> HE'S REASSURING HIMSELF THAT

384
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

385
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
HE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY A

386
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
CARED ABOUT HIS TEACHER.

387
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
HE WAS VERY CLOSE WITH HER AND

388
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
SHE REALLY LOVED THEIR CLASS.

389
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
HE KEPT SAYING THAT I HOPE SHE'S

390
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
OKAY.
I HOPE IT'S NOT HER.

391
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
HE KNOWS THAT SHE'S BEEN HURT,

392
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW THE END

393
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
RESULT.
HE KNOWS THE KIDS THAT HE SAW

394
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
GETTING SHOT.

395
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE OUTCOME.

396
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
SO, I THINK HE'S REASSURING

397
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
HIMSELF IN HIS 6-YEAR-OLD MIND.

398
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I KNOW HE'S PROCESSING IT, BUT I

399
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
THINK HE'S REASSURING HIMSELF.

400
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I THINK HE'S TELLING HIMSELF

401
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

402
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
WE HAD TO PUT THE SIGN OUT IN

403
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
THE FRONT TODAY ASKING PEOPLE

404
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
NOT TO RING THE DOORBELL BECAUSE

405
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
HE STILL HASN'T INTERNALIZED THE

406
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
FACT THAT THIS GUNMAN, THIS BAD

407
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
GUY IS GONE AND HE WANTS TO KNOW

408
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
IF THERE ARE MORE BAD GUYS IN

409
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
THE WORLD AND I DON'T KNOW HOW

410
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION

411
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
PROPERLY.

412
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
AND, SO, WHEN SOMEONE RINGS THE

413
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
DOORBELL, HE THINKS IT'S HIM

414
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
COMING BACK, COMING FOR HIM.

415
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
SO, HE, YOU KNOW, HE -- SO, I

416
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
THINK OUR BIGGEST CONCERN NOW IS

417
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
MAKING SURE THAT WE HANDLE HIS

418
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000

CAREFULLY AND SUPPORT HIM AND

420
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
SUPPORT OUR DAUGHTER BECAUSE

421
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
SHE, AGAIN, DOES PROCESS THINGS

422
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN HE DOES.

423
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
THAT'S OUR JOB AS PARENTS NOW TO

424
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
STAY CLOSE TO THEM, HOLD THEM,

425
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
HUG THEM, LOVE THEM AND LET THEM

426
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000

WE SAW MORE VIGILS HERE LAST

637
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
NIGHT, AS PEOPLE PAY THEIR

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
RESPECTS TO THE 20 CHILDREN AND

639
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000

ALL OF THOSE CHILDREN WERE JUST

WELL, GOOD MORNING, KATE.

653
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
WE KNOW THAT INVESTIGATORS TELL

654
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
US THAT THEY ARE MAKING

655
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
PROGRESS, BUT THEY'RE NOT SAYING

656
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000

THEY'RE MAKING.

ABOUT.
FOR EXAMPLE, THEY ARE VERY

664
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
INTERESTED IN ANYTHING HE MAY

665
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
HAVE WRITTEN DOWN.
ANY E-MAILS HE MAY HAVE SENT AS

666

667
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
KIND OF A MOTIVE AND WHAT HE WAS

DISCOVERED WITH THE SHOOTER IN A

712
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
CLASSROOM, WHERE HE TOOK HIS OWN

713
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000

BOUGHT LEGALLY BY HIS MOTHER.

718
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
THAT LONG GUN WAS USED TO KILL

719
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
SEVERAL VICTIMS.

WOUNDS EACH.
ALL THE WOUNDS I KNOW OF AT THIS

LONG WEAPON.

BUT SO FAR AUTHORITIES SAY THEY

731
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
HAVE FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF THAT.

732

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TOLD

737
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
INVESTIGATORS THAT THE YOUNGER

738
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
BROTHER, THE SHOOTER, WAS

739
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
AUTISTIC, BUT CERTAINLY NONE OF

740
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
THIS ADDS UP FOR INVESTIGATORS

741
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
SO FAR.

742
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
WHY HE ALLEGEDLY DID WHAT HE

743
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
DID.
KATE?

744
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
>> SUSAN, YOU HEARD IN THE PIECE

745
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
LIEUTENANT VANCE SAY THEY DID

746
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
RECOVER MATERIALS AT THE HOUSE

747
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
THAT WILL BE KEY IN HELPING TO

748
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
TELL THE STORY OF WHAT MAY HAVE

749
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
CAUSED THIS TO HAPPEN.

750
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
WHAT LED UP TO IT.

751
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT

752
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
TYPES OF MATERIALS THOSE MIGHT

753
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
BE?
>> THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT SAYING.

754
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
SO, WE'VE CERTAINLY PRESSED THEM

755
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
ON IT.

756
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY'VE BEEN

757
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
LOOKING AT A COMPUTER AND

758
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
LOOKING AT LETTERS OR WRITTEN OR

759
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
ANY KIND OF LETTERS HE MIGHT

760
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
HAVE WRITTEN DOWN TO PEOPLE TO

761
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
TRY TO EXPRESS HIS THOUGHTS.

762
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
BUT THEY'RE NOT SAYING EXACTLY

763
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
WHAT THAT WAS.

764
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
DID SOMETHING HAVE TO DO WITH

765
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
THE GUN COLLECTION THAT THE

766
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
MOTHER HAD THERE?

767
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
IT CERTAINLY APPEARS, JOHN, AS

768
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
YOU KNOW, HE APPEARED TO HAVE

769
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
USED ONE OF THOSE GUNS TO KILL

770
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
HIS OWN MOTHER.

771
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
>> AND, SUSAN, ALSO YOU HAD SAID

772
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
EARLIER THIS HOUR THAT IT

773
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
APPEARS THAT INVESTIGATORS KNOW

774
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
WHICH WEAPON THIS YOUNG, THIS

775
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
YOUNG MAN USED ON HIMSELF, BUT

776
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
ARE STILL WITHHOLDING THAT

777
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
INFORMATION.

778
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
WHAT'S THE PROCESS OF THIS?

779
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
WHY WITHHOLD THE INFORMATION?

780
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
THESE INVESTIGATORS HAVEN'T

781
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
REALLY COME OUT PUBLICLY YET TO

782
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
EVEN I.D. HIM.

783
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

784
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT WE'VE

785
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
BEEN ASKING THAT TIME AND AGAIN.

786
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
BUT, WE KEEP HEARING, LOOK, THIS

787
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
IS A DECISION BEING MADE BY THE

788
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
LEAD INVESTIGATORS OF THIS CASE,

789
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE AND

790
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
THEY HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO FORMALLY

791
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
RELEASE THE NAME OF THE SHOOTER

792
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
AT THIS TIME.

793
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
WE STILL DON'T HAVE AN

794
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
EXPLANATION, FOR EXAMPLE, AS TO

795
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
WHY THERE WAS A MIX UP ON THE

796
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
DAY THAT THIS HAPPENED.

797
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
WHEN INITIALLY SOURCES AND LAW

798
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WERE
IDENTIFYING THE SHOOTER AS THE

799
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
OLDER BROTHER WHEN, IN FACT, IT

800
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
WAS THE YOUNGER BROTHER.

801
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT

802
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
HAPPENED THERE EITHER.

803
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
>> YEAH.
ABSOLUTELY.

804
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, GREAT REPORTING

805
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
FOR YOU HERE IN NEWTOWN,

806
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
CONNECTICUT.

807
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
THANKS SO MUCH.

808
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
>> EVERY HOUR THAT DOES PASHERE

809
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE

810
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
TRAGIC DEATHS OF THE 26 PEOPLE

811
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
AT THE SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY

812
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
SCHOOL.
OFFICIALS SAY THE VICTIMS WERE

813
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES AND THAT

814
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
MOST WERE KILLED BY THIS RIFLE.

815
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
WE KNOW THE .223 CALIBER

816
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
BUSHMASTER SEMI-AUTOMATIC WAS

817
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
FOUND NEAR THE SHOOTER WHEN HE

818
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
WAS DECEASED AND LEGALLY

819
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
PURCHASED BY NANCY LANZA, THE

820
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
SHOOTER'S MOTHER.

821
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
TOM FUENTES, ALSO A CNN

822
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
CONTRIBUTOR.

823
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
TOM, KNOWING NOW THAT THIS

824
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
BUSHMASTER, THIS ASSAULT WEAPON

825
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
WAS THE LIKELY GUN THAT WAS

826
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
USED.

827
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
ARE YOU EVEN SURPRISED THE

828
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
SITUATION WASN'T WORSE?

829
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
>> WELL, IT WOULD BE PRETTY

830
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
HORRIFIC JUST BECAUSE OF THAT,

831
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
JOHN.

832
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
THE BUSHMASTER BULLET WOULD BE

833
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
ABOUT THREE TIMES FASTER, LONGER

834
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
AND MORE POWERFUL THAN THE

835
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
BULLETS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

836
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
FIRED FROM THE TWO HANDGUNS.

837
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
SO, I THINK THAT WHEN THE

838
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
MEDICAL EXAMINER YESTERDAY

839
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
MENTIONED THAT ALL OF THE WOUNDS

840
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
ALL OF THE VICTIMS WERE KILLED

841
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
WITH THE LONG GUN, THE NATURE OF

842
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
THOSE WOUNDS WOULD HAVE BEEN
EXTREMELY HORRIBLE.

843
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
>> AND, TOM, THE BUSHMASTER IS A

844
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
MILITARY-STYLE RIFLE.

845
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
IT'S NOT A SHOTGUN YOU WOULD USE

846
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
FOR HUNTING, YOU COULD SAY.

847
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW WHY A

848
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
CIVILIAN WOULD OWN THAT RIFLE?

849
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
>> WELL, ONE REASON WOULD BE

850
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
SOME CLAIM THAT IT HAS SPORTING

851
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
PURPOSES FOR EITHER HUNTING OR

852
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
EVEN JUST TARGET PRACTICE, AS A

853
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
SPORTING GUN.

854
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
BUT MOST PEOPLE THAT PURCHASE

855
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
THAT WEAPON CLAIM IT'S FOR

856
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
PERSONAL PROTECTION.

857
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
IT'S TO PROTECT THEIR HOMES OR

858
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
THEIR FAMILIES AND THEY WOULD

859
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
PREFER TO HAVE THAT KIND OF FIRE

860
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
POWER, AS OPPOSED TO A SHOTGUN

861
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
OR EVEN JUST PISTOLS WITHIN THE

862
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
HOME.
WE ALSO DON'T KNOW IF THERE WERE

863
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
GUNS THAT WERE RECOVERED THAT

864
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
HOME.
SHE MAY HAVE HAD SHOTGUNS, AS

865
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
WELL.
THE CHOICE OF THAT PARTICULAR

866
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
WEAPON, FRANKLY, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S

867
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
FOR HUNTING PEOPLE.

868
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
IT'S THE MAIN PURPOSE THAT YOU

869
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
WOULD WANT TO HAVE A WEAPON LIKE

870
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
THAT.
TO EITHER TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF

871
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
OR FOR PROTECTIVE PURPOSES,

872
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
CERTAINLY.

873
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
BUT A MUCH MORE POWERFUL GUN

874
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
THAN THOSE TWO HANDGUNS.

875
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
>> FOLLOW UP ON THAT, TOM.

876
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
ONE THING THAT THE MEDICAL

877
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
EXAMINER SAID THAT CAUGHT ME BY

878
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
SURPRISE WERE THAT THE BULLETS

879
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
WERE DESIGNED SOMEHOW TO STAY IN

880
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
THE TISSUE.

881
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I'M NOT A GUN PERSON.

882
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
DWR DON

883
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT GUNS.

884
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT THAT

885
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
MEANS?
>> AS A FORMER S.W.A.T TEAM

886
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
INSPECTOR, I'M NOT SURE WHAT HE

887
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
MEANS BY THAT.

888
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
THE .223 ROUND IS THE SAME ROUND

889
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
THAT WOULD BE FIRED OUT OF AN

890
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
M16.
IT HAS A MUZZLE VELOCITY OF OVER

891
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
215 FEET PER SECOND.

892
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
TO GET THAT BULLET TO SHOOT IN A

893
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
WAY THAT WOULD MAKE IT NOT FULLY

894
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
PENETRATE AND GO THROUGH TWO OR

895
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
THREE BODIES, FOR THAT MATTER,

896
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'M NOT QUITE CLEAR WHAT HE

897
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
MEANS BY HOW THAT WAS DESIGNED.

898
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
IF YOU SOFTEN THE LEAD OR, IN

899
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
THIS CASE, THE OUTER PART OF THE

900
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
BULLET WOULD HAVE A COPPER

901
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
JACKET AROUND IT SO THAT IT

902
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
WOULD FEED MORE EASILY THROUGH

903
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
THE GUN AS YOU'RE SHOOTING IT

904
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
AND PULLING THE TRIGGER.

905
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
THE OLD CASING IS EJECTED AND

906
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
THE NEW BULLET ISERED AND

907
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
YOU KEEP FIRING THAT WAY.

908
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
IT WOULD INTERFERE WITH THE

909
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
LOADING AND THE CONTINUED

910
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
ABILITY TO FIRE THAT WEAPON IN

911
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
RAPID SUCCESSION.

912
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT HE MEANT

913
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
BY THAT.
>> ALL RIGHT.

914
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
FORMER FBI DIRECTOR TOM FUENTES.

915
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HELPING US

916
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS A LITTLE

917
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
BIT BETTER.

918
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
THANKS, TOM.
>> THANK YOU.

919
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
>>> BACK IN NEWTOWN, WE'RE

920
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS.

921
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
DOING THAT QUITE A LOT.

922
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
SO MANY VICTIMS TO REMEMBER.

923
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
COMING UP, WE'LL HEAR FROM A

924
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
FATHER OF A 6-YEAR-OLD GIRL

925
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
KILLED IN THE ATTACK.

926
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
HE MOVED MANY PEOPLE TO TEARS

927
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
AND HOW HE WANTS US ALL TO

928
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
REMEMBER HIS LITTLE GIRL.

929
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
[ sniffs ] I HAVE A COLD.

930
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
[ sniffs ] I TOOK DAYQUIL
BUT MY NOSE IS STILL RUNNY.

931
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
[ Male Announcer ] TRUTH IS,
DAYQUIL DOESN'T TREAT THAT.

932
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
REALLY?
[ Male Announcer ]
Alka-Seltzer Plus

933
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
FIGHTS YOUR WORST
COLD SYMPTOMS,

934
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
PLUS IT RELIEVES
YOUR RUNNY NOSE.

935
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
[ breathes deeply ]
AWESOME.

936
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
[ Male Announcer ]
YES, IT IS.

937
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
THAT'S THE COLD TRUTH!

938
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
to the number 1 club
in the world.

939
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
The potential of
Manchester United unlocked.

940
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
NYSE Euronext.

941
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Unlocking the world's potential.

942
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
When we got married.

943
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I had three kids.

944
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And she became the full time
mother of three.

945
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
It was soccer, and ballet, and
cheerleading, and baseball.

946
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Those years were crazy.

947
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
So, as we go into
this next phase,

948
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
you know, a big part
of it for us is that

949
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
there isn't anything on the
schedule.

950
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
>>> THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS

951
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
HERE IN NEWTOWN HAVE BEEN

952
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
LARGELY SILENT.

953
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
INSTEAD OF CHOOSING TO GRIEVE

954
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
PRIVATELY, THEY ARE CHOOSING,

955
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
RATHER, TO GRIEVE PRIVATELY AND

956
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
WE'RE RESPECTING THAT PRIVACY

957
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
BEING CAREFUL NOT TO BARGE IN

958
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
AND TALK TO ANYONE WHO DOESN'T

959
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
WANT TO TALK TO US.

960
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
BUT ONE FATHER WANTED US TO KNOW

961
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
MORE ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER.

962
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
HER NAME WAS EMILIE PARKER AND

963
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
SHE WAS JUST 6 YEARS OLD.

964
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
>> EMILIE WAS A MENTOR TO HER

965
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
TWO LITTLE SISTERS IN FINDING

966
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
THE SIMPLE JOYS IN LIFE.

967
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
EMILIE'S LAUGHTER WAS INFECTIOUS

968
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD THE

969
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
PLEASURE TO MEET HER WOULD AGREE

970
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
THIS WORLD IS A BETTER PLACE

971
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
BECAUSE SHE WAS IN IT.

972
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
SHE WAS THEIR BEST FRIEND.

973
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
THEY WERE ALL BORN WITHIN THREE

974
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
YEARS OF EACH OTHER, SO, BY LAW,

975
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE.

976
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
SHE WAS TEACHING MY MIDDLE

977
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
DAUGHTER TO READ.

978
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
SHE WOULD HELP MY YOUNGEST

979
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
DAUGHTER LEARN HOW TO MAKE

980
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
THINGS, SHOW HER HOW TO DO

981
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
CRAFTS.

982
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
THEY LOOKED UP TO HER.

983
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
AND THEY LOOK TO HER WHEN THEY

984
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
NEEDED COMFORT.

985
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
USUALLY THAT'S SAVED FOR A MOM

986
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
AND A DAD.

987
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
BUT IT WAS REALLY SWEET TO SEE

988
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
THE TIMES WHEN ONE OF THEM WOULD

989
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
FALL OR ONE WOULD GET THEIR

990
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
FEELINGS HURT AND HOW THEY WOULD

991
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
RUN TO EMILIE FOR SUPPORT AND

992
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
HUGS AND KISSES.
SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT

993
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
WOULD JUST LIGHT UP A ROOM.

994
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
SHE, SHE ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING

995
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
KIND TO SAY ABOUT ANYBODY.

996
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
HER LOVE AND THE STRENGTH THAT

997
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
SHE GAVE US AND THE EXAMPLE THAT

998
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
SHE SHOWED US IS REMARKABLE.

999
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE PERSON.

1000
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
AND I'M SO BLESSED TO BE HER

1001
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
DAD.
I WAS LEAVING TO WORK AND SHE

1002
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
WOKE UP BEFORE I LEFT AND I HAVE

1003
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
ACTUALLY BEEN TEACHING HER

1004
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
PORTUGUESE AND OUR LAST

1005
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
CONVERSATION WAS IN PORTUGUESE

1006
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
AND SHE TOLD ME GOOD MORNING AND

1007
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
ASKED HOW I WAS DOING AND I SAID

1008
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
THAT I WAS DOING WELL.

1009
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME AND I

1010
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
GAVE HER A KISS AND I WAS OUT

1011
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
THE DOOR.

1012
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
>> I SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW WHERE

1013
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
ROBBIE PARKER, THIS MAN FOUND

1014
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
THE STRENGTH AND COMPOSURE.

1015
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
>> SO WELL SPOKEN.

1016
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
>> SO WELL SPOKEN.

1017
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
HIS DAUGHTER, CLEARLY, SO

1018
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
IMPORTANT TO HIM AND THAT FAMILY

1019
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
SO CLOSE.

1020
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
SO IMPRESSIVE.

1021
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
THE PARKERS MOVED TO CONNECTICUT

1022
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
FROM UTAH JUST EIGHT MONTHS AGO.

1023
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
EMILIE IS GOING TO BE BURIED

1024
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
BACK IN UTAH.

1025
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
>> AS ROBBIE PARKER AND OTHER

1026
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
PARENTS STRUGGLE WITH THE

1027
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
TRAGEDY THAT HAPPENED HERE ON

1028
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
FRIDAY, THEY ALSO FACE ANOTHER

1029
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
CHALLENGE.
HOW TO EXPLAIN IT TO THEIR

1030
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
CHILDREN.

1031
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
SOMETHING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

1032
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
EARLIER.
HERE'S LISA SYLVESTER WITH SOME

1033
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
EXPERT ADVICE.

1034
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
>> IF THERE'S AN IMAGE THAT SUMS

1035
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
UP THIS STORY, IT IS THIS.

1036
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
ANY PARENT OUT THERE CAN RELATE.

COLLEGE OF MEDICINE.

1039
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
>> HOW DO YOU WRAP YOUR MIND

1040
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
AROUND SOMETHING LIKE THIS, WITH

1041
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WILL

1042
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
TAKE A WHILE AND THERE WILL BE

1043
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
PEOPLE CLOSELY IMPACTED BY THIS

1044
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
THAT WILL NEVER WRAP THEIR MIND

1045
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
AROUND THIS.

1046
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
HUMAN MINDS ARE NOT INFINITE AND

1047
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
THIS IS APPEARING TO BE THE

1048
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
WORST SCHOOLYARD CATASTROPHE IN

1049
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
HISTORY.
THERE IS GOING TO BE A HUGE

1050
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
LONG-TERM FALLOUT FOR THIS THAT

1051
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
WILL IMPACT PEOPLE'S EMOTIONAL

1052
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
WELL BEING AND WE NEED TO GEAR

1053
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
OURSELVES FOR THIS FALLOUT

1054
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
BECAUSE IT IS COMING.

1055
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
>> THE NEWS OUT OF NEWTOWN IS

1056
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
TRAUMATIC FOR PARENTS AND

1057
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
CHILDREN.

1058
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
THIS HAPPENED AT A SCHOOL WHERE

1059
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
KIDS ARE SUPPOSED TO FEEL SAFE.

1060
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
>> HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS TO

1061
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
CHILDREN?
AGAIN, IT DEPENDS ON THE AGE OF

1062
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
THE CHILD.

1063
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
SIMPLE, FORTHRIGHT EXPLANATIONS

1064
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
ARE THE BEST.

1065
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I TELL

1066
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
CHILDREN IS THERE ARE SOME BAD
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND

1067
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
SOMETIMES BAD PEOPLE DO REALLY

1068
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
TERRIBLE THINGS.

1069
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
AND A TERRIBLE THING HAS

1070
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
HAPPENED AND THERE HAVE BEEN

1071
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
SOME CHILDREN KILLED AND THIS IS

1072
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
TERRIBLE, BUT YOU'RE SAFE.

1073
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SAFE AND

1074
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
YOU'RE IN A SITUATION NOW WHERE

1075
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE HARMED.

1076
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
>> THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF

1077
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
PEDIATRICS OFFERS THIS ADVICE.

1078
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE AGE OF THE

1079
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
CHILD AND PROVIDE BASIC

1080
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
INFORMATION, WITHOUT OFFERING

1081
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
DETAILS THAT MAY ONLY ALARM

1082
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
THEM.
ASK YOUR CHILDREN WHAT THEY

1083
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
ALREADY KNOW AND ANSWER

1084
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
QUESTIONS.
PARENTS CAN SHARE THEIR OWN

1085
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
FEELINGS AND THE WAYS THEY'RE

1086
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
COPING AND FIND MEANINGFUL WAYS

1087
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
TO HELP OTHERS.

1088
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
>> CHILDREN ARE RESILIENT AND

1089
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
WHAT REALLY MATTERS NOW IS HOW

1090
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
WE HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

1091
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
HAPPENED, BUT EVEN I THINK MORE

1092
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
IMPORTANT IS THE SENSE OF

1093
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
PROTECTION AND SAFETY THAT WE

1094
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
GIVE THEM STARTING THIS MOMENT

1095
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
AND FOR THE NEXT WEEKS AND

1096
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
MONTHS.

1097
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
WITNESSED, THOSE CHILDREN WHO

1098
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
SAW, THOSE WHO COVERED THEIR

1099
