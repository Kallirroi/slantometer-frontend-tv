WE WERE LIVE 10:15 EASTERN

214
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
TIME WHEN THE NEWS JUST

215
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
STARTED TO COME ACROSS THE

216
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000

217
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
AND FRANKLY AT THE TIME, WE

218
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
WERE TOLD ONE PERSON WAS SHOT

219
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
IN THE FOOT AND TREATED IN THE

220
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000

221
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
THERE LITTLE NUSE AFTER THAT

222
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
AND THAT WENT ON FOR A

223
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME.

224
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
IT WAS 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR

225
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
WHEN WE LEARNED THE DETAILS WE

226
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
GO BACK AND PIECE TOGETHER IN

227
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
THE MIND.
THERE WERE NO OTHER INJURIES.

228
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
THERE WERE JUST DEAD BODIES

229
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
INDEED OF THE ELEMENTARY

230
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
SCHOOL HERE IN CONNECTICUT.

231
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
AND THE POLICE WERE ABSORBING

232
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
THE INFORMATION AND GOING ROOM

233
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
TO ROOM AND TRYING TO MAKE

234
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
SURE THE KILLER AND GUNMAN WAS

235
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
ACCOUNTED FOR AND THOUGH ONE

236
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
ELSE WAS INSIDE .

237
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
MANY OF THE CHILDREN WERE TOLD

238
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
TO CLOSE THEIR EYES AND RUN TO

239
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
GET OUT OF THE BUILDING AND

240
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
MAKE SURE THEY DIDN'T LOOK

241
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
AROUND THE SURROUNDINGS WHERE

242
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
THEY WERE.

243
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I SPOKE TO A WOMAN WHOYCE

244
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
DAUGHTER IS OKAY.

245
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
THEY WERE LED OUT OF THE BACK

246
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
DOOR OF THE SCHOOL TO MAKE

247
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
SURE THEY DID NOT PASS BY ANY

248
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
OF THE DEAD CHILDREN WHO WERE

249
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
LYING THERE IN THE CLASSROOMS

250
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
WHERE THEY HAD GONE TO SCHOOL

251
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
HERE.

252
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000

THROUGH THE TOWN TODAY.

259
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
>>> I DON'T THINK I COULD SAY

260
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
IT ANY BETTER THAN THAT, BILL.

261
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THE IDEA THAT THE KIDS WERE

262
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
TOLD CLOSE YOUR EYES AS THEY

263
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
WALKED THEM OUT.

264
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
THREE STORIES STRUCK ME TODAY

272
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000

DOORS AND PUTTING THEM IN THE

277
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
LAVATORIES AND ONE WAS

278
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
INTERVIEWED BY ABC EARLIER

279
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
TONIGHT.
>>> I TOOK ONE OF THE STUDENTS

280
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
ON TOP OF THE TOILEST.

281
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I KNEW TO GET IN THERE AND YOU

282
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

283
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
AND I PULLED THE BOOK SHELF

284
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
AND WE WERE BARRICADED IN

285
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
THAT.
>>> DUTELL THEM TO BE QUIET.

286
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
DID YOU WORRY.

287
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I TOLD THEM TO BE QUIET.

288
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
AND BE ABSOLUTELY QUIET.

AND START SHOOTING THE DOOR .

291
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
WE HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTELY QUIET

292
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
AND I SAID.

293
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THERE ARE BAD GUYS AND WE NEED

294
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
TO WAIT FOR THE GOOD GUYS.

295
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
>>> I JUST WANTED US TO BE

296
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
OKAY.
AND I WAS SO, SO SADDENED THAT

297

ANYONE WHO KNEW THEM.

301
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
AND WAS PART OF THEIR LIVES.

302
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

303
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000

BACK TUP WITH GOOD TRAINING.

754
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
THE HUMAN BRAIN IS IT THE

755
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
GREATEST DEFENSE MECHANISM AND

756
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
STUR VIVAL MECHANISM KNOWN TO

COLLEAGUE I RESPECT GREATLY.

759
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
HE'S RIGHT.
IF WE PROGRAM THE BRAIN AND

760
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
TEACH PEOPLE THERE ARE A

761
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
NUMBER OF INCIDENTS THAT HAVE

762
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
BEEN STOPPED THROUGH

763
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
TECHNIQUES.
BUNOTHING IS 100%.

764
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
>>> THANK YOU, SIR.

765
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
COMING UP NEXT.

766
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
WE ARE CONTINUING TO GET

767
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
DETAILS.

768
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
HIS BROTHER IS IN CUSTODY AND

769
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
PROVIDING CRUCIAL INFORMATION

770
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
ABOUT THE GUNMAN'S MENTAL

771
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
CONDITION.
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THAT COMING

772
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
UP TODAY'S TRAGEDY REMINDS OF

773
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
COLUMBINE.
WE'LL SPEAK TO A FATHER WHO

774
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
LOST HIS DAUGHTER.

775
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
AND OFFERS THOUGHT TOTS

776
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
FAMILIES THAT LOST EVERYTHING

777
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
TODAY

778
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
THE SHOOTING APPEARS TO HAVE

779
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
STOPPED AND THE SCHOOL IS IN

780
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
LOCK DOWN.

781
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I LOOK UP TO A LOT
OF THE OLDER HEADS, YOU KNOW,

782
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
THE INNOVATORS, THE HEADS

783
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
OF THE ART MOVEMENTS
OF THE PAST.

784
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
THEY KEPT IT REALLY EDGY,
AND, LIKE, A LOT

785
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
OF THE LATIN AMERICAN MURALISTS
AND THE LATIN AMERICAN ARTISTS,

786
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
THEIR STYLES ARE VERY UNIQUE
AND NEW TO THEIR TIME,

787
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
YOU KNOW,
SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL,

788
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
BUT THAT'S
WHO I LOOK UP TO MAINLY.

789
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
PERSONALLY, I'M VERY EXCITED
ABOUT GOING TO COLLEGE.

790
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
IT'S SOMETHING NEW,
AND IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT

791
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
THAN WHAT I'M USED TO.

792
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO BE
A LITTLE OUT OF MY ELEMENT,

793
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO
EXCITING IS THAT, YOU KNOW,

794
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
IT'S SOMETHING FRESH.

795
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
WELL, THERE'S SO MANY
OPPORTUNITIES THAT I THINK

796
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I COULD MISS OUT ON
IF I DIDN'T GO, YOU KNOW.

797
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
GETTING INTO COLLEGE
TAKES PLANNING AND VISION.

798
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST LIKE
WHEN I TAKE A BRICK WALL

799
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
AND TURN IT
INTO A CANVAS FOR MY ART.

800

831
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000

AND THE COUNTRY MOURNS THE

841
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
TRAGEDY.

IT IS NOT THE FIRST SCHOOL

843
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
SHOOTING THAT THE NATION HAS

844
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000

DARRYL, AS A PARENT, ALL I CAN

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

CAN TELL A PARENT THAT LOST

860
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
THE CHILD.
THEY NEED THEIR FRIENDS AND

861
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
FAMILY.

862
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
IN OUR CASE, WE MADE CHOICES.

863
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
WE MADE THE CHOICE NOT TO BE

864
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
ANGRY AND BETTER BUT TO

865
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
CELEBRATE RACHEL'S LIFE AND

866
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000

A LOT OF THE ANSWERS ARE LONG

874
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
TERM.

875
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
THEY ARE NOT JUST A KNEE JERK

876
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
REACTION OR MORE LAWS AND

877
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
REGULATIONS .

878
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
BUT WE HAVE TO BE A KINDER

879
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
NATION AND TAKE TIME TO LISTEN

880
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
TO ONE ANOTHER AND BE ROLE

RIGHT.

885
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
MY SON CRAIG WAS IN THE

886
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
LIBRARY AND HE CAME WITHIN A

887
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
SPLIT SECOND OF BEING KILLED.

888
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
AND I WOULD HAVE LOST TWO

889
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000

890
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE

901
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO HEAL

902
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
THIS PAIN.

903
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO

00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000

905
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
>>> HONESTLY, YOU NEVER

00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
TOTALLY HEAL.
THERE IS ALWAYS A HOLE IN YOUR

907
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
HEART WHEN YOU LOSE A CHILD.

908
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000

00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
DO THAT.

928
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000

1231
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
HORRIFIC.

I CAN JUST IMAGINE WHAT THIS

1236
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
WAS.

1237
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000

1239
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
THIS PUNK.

1240
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
PROBABLY SHOT THEM IN THE HEAD

1241
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
AND IF HE SHOT BODY SHOTS, WE

1242
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
WOULD HAVE HAD A LOT MORE

1243
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000

HOW DO YOU KIND OF, I GUESS IT

1248
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
IS LIKE ANY JOB, YOU HAVE TO

1249
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
FIND A WAY TO COMPARTMENTALIZE

1250
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
WHAT YOU ARE WITNESSING OR YOU

1251
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
DON'T SURVIVE.

1252
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
>> IN A SENSE, THE DECEEDENTS

1253
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
ARE OUT OF THE PAIN AND

1254
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
MISERY.
IT IS IT THE PARTNERS AND

1255
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
FAMILIES.
THEY ARE GOING THROUGH A STATE

1256
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
THAT WILL LAST A FEW DAYS

1257
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
UNTIL THEY GET THEIR BABIES

1258
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
BACK.

1259
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
THE SIVENADULTS WILL BE

1260
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
AUTOPSIED ESPECIALLY THE

1261
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
PERPETRATOR.
BUT THE CHILDREN HAVE TO BE

1262
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
EXAMINED AND THEY HAVE

1263
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
DOCUMENT THE INJURIES ON THE

1264
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
CHILDREN AND IF THERE ARE

1265
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
BULLETS IN THE BODIES THEY

1266
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
HAVE TO BE REMOVED.

1267
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000

1268
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000

1269
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
WEAPON THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

1270
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
IT TAKES TIME.

1271
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000

1272
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
AND I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH

1273
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000

1275

1276
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000

1277
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I GET CALLS IN THE OFFICE.

LET'S BE HONEST IF A GUY HAD A

00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000

1282
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
PEOPLE YOU WOULD AT LEAST BE

1283
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
ABLE TO LIMIT IT.

1284
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000

1285
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
>> THAT'S WHY THEY TARGET

1286
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
SCHOOL SYSTEMS.
>> IT IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO

1287
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
IT.

1288
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
THESE ARE PRECIOUS THINGINGS.

1289
