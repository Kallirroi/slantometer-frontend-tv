AND JUST SO YOU KNOW A LITTLE

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
BIT MORE ABOUT THAT LITTLE

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
CHILD.
SHE LOVED HORSES.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
SHE WANTED A COWBOY HAT AND

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
COWBOY BOOTS FOR CHRISTMAS.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
HER PARENTS SPOKE WITH ABC NEWS

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
ABOUT THEIR LITTLE ANGEL.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
>> SHE WAS A BALL OF FIRE.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
SHE RULED THE ROOST.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
>> OUR LITTLE CEO WE CALLED HER.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
SHE WAS THE BOSS.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
FUNERALS THAT HAVE YET TO TAKE

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
PLACE IN THIS TOWN, NOT ONLY FOR

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
THE CHILDREN BUT THE TEACHERS,

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
AS WELL.
AT THIS TIME, THOUGH, THERE IS

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
THE BUSINESS OF GETTING THESE

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
CHILDREN BACK TO SOME KIND OF

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
NORMALCY AND FOR SO MANY PEOPLE

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
THAT MEANS SCHOOL.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
SANDRA ENDO HAS BEEN COVERING

GIVE ME A BIT OF A BREAK DOWN ON

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
HOW THE SCHOOL DISTRICT GOT

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
THINGS UP TO SPEED SO QUICKLY

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
AND HOW THEY ARE PREPARED FOR

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
GETTING THE CHILDREN BACK INTO

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
SCHOOL SAFELY, SECURELY AND

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000

TEACHERS HERE IN NEWTOWN.

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
TWO-HOUR DELAY FOR ALL SCHOOLS.

RESET BUTTON.

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
STUDENTS NEEDING A BREAK TRYING

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
TO ABSORB EVERYTHING THAT HAS

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
HAPPENED HERE IN THIS TOWN.

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS AND

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
FACULTY THEY HAVE ALSO HAD A

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
CHANCE TO TALK TO GRIEVANCE

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
COUNSELORS AND TO FIGURE OUT HOW

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
BEST TO APPROACH RETURNING BACK

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
TO SCHOOL.

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
AND, OF COURSE, EXPERTS ARE

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
SAYING IT IS IMPORTANT FOR

95
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
STUDENTS TO GET BACK TO A

96
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
ROUTINE AND GET BACK TO A SENSE

97
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
OF NORMALCY.

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
THEY SAY THIS COULD BE THE FIRST

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
STEP TO HEALING.

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000

COUNSELORS, GRIEVANCE

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
COUNSELORS, POLICE OFFICERS WILL

104
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
ALL BE ON HAND AT THESE SCHOOLS.

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
PRINCIPALS HAVE TOLD PARENTS TO

106
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
MAKE SURE THEY TALK TO THEIR

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
CHILDREN BEFORE ENTERING A

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
CLASSROOM BECAUSE IT IS AN

109
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
UNCONTROLLED SETTING.

110
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER

111
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
STUDENTS MAY SAY.

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR CHILD TO

113
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
LEARN ABOUT THE TRAGEDY FROM

114
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
OTHER STUDENTS, AS WELL.

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
CLEARLY THEY ARE OPENING THE

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
LINES OF COMMUNICATION AND WE

117
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
KNOW THAT TEACHERS WILL BE

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE

119
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
IN NEWTOWN AT SANDY HOOK

120
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TO THEIR

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
STUDENTS IN AN AGE APPROPRIATE

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
MANNER.

123
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
SO THEY REALLY THOUGHT OUT THE

124
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
PROCESS HERE AND THEY ARE HOPING

125
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
THAT A LOT OF THESE STUDENTS

126
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
COULD GET BACK TO A SENSE OF

127
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
ROUTINE AND A SENSE OF NORMALCY

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
IN ORDER TO HEAL.

129
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
>> AND SANDRA, I WANT TO MAKE

130
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
SURE THAT OUR VIEWERS ARE AWARE

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
OF THE PROTOCOL THAT HAS TAKEN

132
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
FORM ON ITS OWN HERE.

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
THESE ARE CHILDREN.

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
AND WE DON'T TAKE PICTURES OF

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
CHILDREN WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS'

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
PERMISSION.

137
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF THE NUMBER

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
OF KIDS RETURNING TO SCHOOL,

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
PASSING BEHIND YOU THERE HAVE

140
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
BEEN SCHOOL BUSES.

141
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I HAVE SEEN PARENTS WALKING

142
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL.

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
HOW HAS THE MEDIA RESPONDED TO

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THE NEED FOR RESPECT OF THESE

145
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
PEOPLE'S PRIVACY DESPITE THE

146
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
FACT THAT NOTHING CAN BE REALLY

147
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
NORMAL?

148
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY.
WE ARE TAKING EVERY PRECAUTION

149
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
COVERING THIS STORY AND THIS

150
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
TREMENDOUS TRAGEDY THAT HAS

151
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
ROCKED THIS TOWN AND THE ENTIRE

152
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
NATION.
WE ARE NOT GOING NEARBY SCHOOLS.

153
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
WE ARE NOT SHOWING KIDS' FACES.

154
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
WE SEE THE PAIN AND AGONY IN SO

155
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
MANY PEOPLE'S FACES AS THEY COME

156
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
HERE TO THIS MAKE SHIFT MEMORIAL

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
IN THE MIDDLE OF TOWN TO PAY

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
RESPECTS AND CONDOLENCES TO THE

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
LIVES LOST IN THE TRAGEDY.

160
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
WE HAVE TALKED TO PARENTS AND
STUDENTS WHO ARE WILLING TO TALK

161
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
TO US.
I HAVE GOTTEN THE SENSE OF

162
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
ANXIETY OF RETURNING BACK TO

163
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
SCHOOL TODAY AND SOME PARENTS

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
AND STUDENTS SAY THEY ARE A

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
LITTLE NERVOUS AND SCARED BUT

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
CLEARLY THEY WANT TO GET BACK TO

167
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
SEEING THEIR FRIENDS AND HAVE

168
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
THAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY.

169
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
>> SANDRA ENDO REPORTING FOR US

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
LIVE IN FRONT OF ONE OF THE MANY

171
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
MAKE SHIFT MEMORIALS THAT HAVE

172
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
POPPED UP ALL AROUND TOWN.

173
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU OVER TO

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
MONROE, THE NEIGHBORING TOWN.

175
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
IT IS ABOUT TO BECOME AN

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AGAIN.

177
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I WILL GIVE YOU A LAY OF THE

178
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
LAND AS TO HOW THEY WILL

179
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
TRANSFORM THAT BUILDING TO MAKE

180
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
IT AS SIMILAR AS THEY CAN TO THE

181
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
ENVIRONMENT THAT THE LITTLE

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
CHILDREN LEFT BEHIND AT SANDY

183
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
HOOK.
THERE IS THIS PARALLEL BIT OF

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
BUSINESS AND THAT IS THE

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION THAT IS

186
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
MASSIVE.

187
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
IT IS ON GOING.
AND MUCH OF IT FOCUSES ON THAT

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
YOUNG MAN WHO PERPETRATED THIS

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
HORRIBLE VIOLENCE.

190
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
SO MUCH OF IT THEY HOPE TO GET

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
FROM THE COMPUTER, THE FAMILY

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
COMPUTERS INSIDE THE HOME OF

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
ADAM LANZA AND HIS MOTHER.

194
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
SADLY, THOUGH, THOSE COMPUTERS

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
DON'T APPEAR TO BE IN VERY GOOD

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
SHAPE AND DEBORAH JOINS US FROM

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
THAT HOME.
GIVE ME A BIT OF WHAT

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
INVESTIGATORS FOUND WHEN THEY

199
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
WENT THROUGH THAT HOME?

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
>> Reporter: ALL OF THE

201
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
MYSTERIES OF WHAT WAS GOING ON

202
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
INSIDE OF ADAM LANZA'S MIND, THE

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
MYSTERY IS LOCKED INSIDE THIS

204
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
HOME.
THIS IS WHERE HE KILLED HIS

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
MOTHER, SHOT IN THE HEAD BEFORE

206
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
GOING ON HIS RAMPAGE.

207
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
WE CAN TELL YOU THAT

208
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
INVESTIGATORS WERE ABLE TO FIND

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
COMPUTERS OR AT LEAST ONE

210
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
COMPUTER.

211
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
BUT IT WAS SMASHED.

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
THEY ARE TRYING TO PIECE

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
TOGETHER THE SHARDS TO HOPEFULLY

214
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
SEE WHAT KIND OF E-MAILS HE WAS

215
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
SENDING AND WEBSITES HE WAS

216
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
GOING TO AND THE DIGITAL FOOT

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
PRINT THAT MAY ALLOW THEM TO

218
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS THINKING

219
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
ABOUT.

220
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF PIECES OF

221
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
NEW INFORMATION.

222
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
FIRST OF ALL JUST TO SET THE

223
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
SCENE HERE, THIS HOME ON THIS

224
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
HILL, SCHOOL BUSES GOING PAST

225
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
THIS MORNING WITH CHILDREN WHO

226
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
ARE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL AND

227
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
CLEARLY THE ABSENCE OF SOME

228
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
CHILDREN WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON

229
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
THOSE BUSES.

230
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
TWO CHILDREN WHO DIED IN THAT

231
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
MASSACRE ACTUALLY LIVE LESS THAN

232
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
HALF A MILE FROM THIS PARTICULAR

233
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
HOME.

234
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
SO THAT IS THE KIND OF COMMUNITY

235
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.

236
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
WE ARE LEARNING THAT A FRIEND

237
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
WHO WAS DOING WORK INSIDE THE

238
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
HOME ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS AGO TOLD

239
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
ME HE NOTICED THERE WAS A GUN

240
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
LOCK BOX THAT ADAM LANZA KEPT IN

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
THE BASEMENT.
THAT IS WHERE IT IS BELIEVED

242
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
THAT SHE KEPT THE GUNS SHE

243
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
POSSESSED.
SHE LIKED SHOOTING, WAS SORT OF

244
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
A COUNTRY GIRL.

245
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
TO HAVE A LOCK BOX WITH THE GUNS

246
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
WE DON'T KNOWHETHER THEY WERE

247
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
INSIDE AT THE TIME.

248
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
NANCY INITIALLY TOOK HER SON TO

249
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THE SHOOTING RANGES BECAUSE SHE

250
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE HIM ALONE

251
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
FOR LARGE PERIODS OF TIME.

252
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
THAT IS WHEN HE MAY HAVE BEGUN

253
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
TO BE INTERESTED IN THIS CONCEPT

254
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
OF SHOOTING, FIRING.

255
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
WE DO KNOW THAT ADAM LANZA WAS

256
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
TRYING TO TRY TO MAINSTREAM HER

257
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
SON.
IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE HAD

258
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
PROBLEMS.
A SCHOOL SECURITY OFFICER

259
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
APPOINTED SPECIFIC OFFICERS TO

260
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

261
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
THEY DIDN'T WANT HIM TO BECOME A

262
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
TARGET OF OTHER CHILDREN WITHIN

263
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
THE SCHOOL.
HE WAS SEEING A PSYCHOLOGIST

264
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
WHEN HE WAS A FRESHMAN.

265
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
THAT ALSO SCHOOL APPOINTED.

266
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
DOCUMENT AND TRYING TO MAKE

268
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
SENSE OF ALL OF THIS WE FOUND

269
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
OTTHAT WHILE THE FATHER WAS

270
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MEDICAL CARE

271
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
THE MOTHER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR

272
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
ALL PSYCHIATRIC AND

273
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPENSES AND

274
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR PRESCRIPTION

275
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
MEDICATIONS.

276
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
THEY ARE LOOKING AT ALL OF THIS

277
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT KIND OF

278
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
MEDICATIONS HE WAS ON AND

279
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
WHETHER OR NOT HE MAY HAVE BEEN

280
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
GETTING THAT TREATMENT.

281
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
WE HAVE SEEN THIS OUTPOURING

282
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THAT YOU TALK ABOUT THERE IN

283
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
NEWTOWN.
FOR THE FIRST TIME SOMEBODY CAME

284
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
AND LAID FLOWERS AT THE HOME OF

285
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
NANCY LANZA.

286
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
SHE WAS A WOMAN WHO WAS VERY

287
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
MUCH LIKED.

288
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
SHE WAS STRUGGLING BUT AT LEAST

289
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING BY

290
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
HER SON, BY HERSELF AND BY HER

291
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
FAMILY.

292
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES IN THE

293
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
SADNESS THAT HAS ENVELOPED THIS

294
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
COMMUNITY THERE IS A LOT OF

295
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
FOCUS ON THOSE THAT DIED AT THE

296
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
SCHOOL AND TEACHERS AND CHILDREN

297
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
AND RIGHTFULLY SO BUT YOU HAVE

298
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
TO REMEMBER THAT SHE WAS A

MURDER VICTIM HERE SHOT IN HER

300
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
THAT FAMILY IS GRIEVING, AS

302
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
WELL.
I AM SURE THAT ADAM LANZA'S

303
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
FATHER IS GOING THROUGH HIS OWN

304
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
PERSONAL HELL AS TWO OF HIS

305
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
FAMILY MEMBERS ARE NOW DEAD.

306
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
AND YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT

307
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
THE ATF HAS TOLD CNN THAT ADAM

308
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000

DIFFERENT GUN RANGES WITH HIS

310
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000

HE HAD TAKEN UP SHOOTING AS A

HOBBY.

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
POINTS.
I AM A MOTHER OF THREE.

373
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I HAVE BEEN A ROOM PARENT IN THE

374
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM.

375
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
AND I THINK THE IMAGE OF THESE

376
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
YOUNG CHILDREN, OF SIX YEAR OLDS

377
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
A WEEK BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS IS SO

378
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
HEARTBREAKING THAT IT IS

379
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
BREAKING THROUGH THE SENSE WE

380
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
CAN'T DO ANYTHING.
THAT IS A QUESTION OF POLITICAL

381
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
WILL.
>> IT MAY BE BREAKING THROUGH

382
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
THE SENSE FOR SOME.

383
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO

384
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS VERY

385
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
SUPPORTIVE OF THE NRA WHO ARE

386
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
SHIFTING THEIR FOCUS AND THEIR

387
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
FEELING.
DO YOU SENSE THAT THAT IS GOING

388
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
TO BE THE SAME FOR MOST

389
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS WHO ALMOST

390
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
TO THE LETTER OF THE D AND THE R

391
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
DON'T SUPPORT STRICTER GUN

392
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
CONTROL MEASURES.
DO YOU SEE THAT THAT IS GOING TO

393
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
PLEAD TO THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF

394
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
THE AISLE?

395
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
>> I THINK THERE WILL BE A

396
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
NATIONAL CONVERSATION WHICH I
WANT TO BE A PART OF BECAUSE

397
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
PART OF THE HEALING PROCESS IS

398
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
MOVING FORWARD IN A WAY TO

399
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
PREVENT ANY OTHER COMMUNITY TO

400
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
EXPERIENCE WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO

401
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
THIS COMMUNITY HERE WHICH IS A

402
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
TREASURED COMMUNITY.

403
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
20 YOUNG INNOCENT CHILDREN, FOUR

404
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
TEACHERS AND A SCHOOL

405
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
PSYCHOLOGIST WHO LAID DOWN THEIR

406
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
LIVES TO PROTECT THEIR STUDENTS.

407
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
WE SHOULD NOT BE HAVING THIS IN

408
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
OUR CLASSROOMS.

409
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
>> THERE IS A NATIONAL

410
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
CONVERSATION.
WE ARE HAVING IT RIGHT NOW.

411
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVERAL

412
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
DAYS.

413
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
HOW CANTANKEROUS THAT

414
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
CONVERSATION IS GOING TO BECOME?

415
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
WE HAVE SOME SUGGEST ISSING

416
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
TEACHERS NEED TO BE ARMED.

417
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
THERE IS A DIGGING IN OF

418
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
CONVICTIONS.

419
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
ARE THINGS GOING TO CHANGE?

420
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
WILL THERE BE A CHANGE?

421
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
IS THIS HORROR THAT WAS VISITED

422
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
UPON YOUR COMMUNITY GOING TO

423
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
MORE ENTRENCHED?

427
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000

428
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD

429
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
POSITIVELY WITH LAWS THAT WORK

430
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000

WE ARE HEARING A RECOGNITION

435
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000

THOSE CHILDREN AND TO PROTECT

438
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
EVERYONE'S CHILDREN.

439
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I AM HOPEFUL.

440
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I WOULDN'T HAVE RUN FOR CONGRESS

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
COULD SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS AND

443
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
FIND COMMON GROUND AND WE WILL

WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE PUBLIC.

446
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000

00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
OF NORMALCY.

558
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
WHEN WE DO GO AND WHEN WE DO

559
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
LEAVE THIS TOWN AND WHEN OUR

560
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
WORLD CONTINUES, WE LEAVE ALL OF

561
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
THESE PEOPLE WITH A BRAND NEW

562
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
NORMAL AND SOMETHING THEY ARE

563
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT FOR

564
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
THEMSELVES WHAT THEIR NEW NORMAL

565
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
IS GOING TO BE LIKE.

566
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I REMEMBER SO WELL AFTER

567
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
SEPTEMBER 11th, THE TERM THE NEW

568
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
NORMAL BECAME SO COMMON PLACE.

569
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
AND IT SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE

570
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
THINGS THAT THESE PEOPLE HERE

571
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ADOPT.

572
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
THE NOTION THAT THEY WILL HAVE A

573
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
NEW NORMAL.

574
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
BUT THEY ARE GOING TO NEED A LOT

575
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
OF HELP TO GET THERE.

576
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE

577
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
WHO WILL HELP THEM.

578
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
WENDY DAVIDSON IS THE GRIEF

579
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
COUNSELOR FROM THIS COMMUNITY.

580
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
SHE IS A LICENSED CERTIFIED

581
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
GRIEF COUNSELOR.

582
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK

583
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
WITH ANY FAMILIES?

584
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
HAS ANYONE REACHED OUT TO YOU

585
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
YET?

586
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I KNOW IT IS EARLY IN THIS

587
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
PROCESS.
>> NO.
NOT YET.

588
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE REACHED OUT

589
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
TO ME ARE EITHER SOME OF THE

590
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
SCHOOL STAFF OR FAMILIES WHOSE

591
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
CHILDREN WERE FRIENDS WITH SOME

592
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
OF THE CHILDREN.

593
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
>> THIS IS A TOWN OF 27,000

594
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
PEOPLE.
I CANNOT IMAGINE THE AMOUNT OF

595
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
WORK THAT LIES AHEAD IN YOUR

596
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
FIELD.

597
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HANDLE THE

598
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
AMOUNT OF COUNSELING THAT IS

599
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
NEEDED?

600
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
HOW MANY OUTSIDE COUNSELORS ARE

601
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
GOING TO HAVE TO COME HERE?

602
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
>> I THINK WE WILL PROBABLY

603
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
PROVIDE A LOT OF GROUP SERVICES.

604
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I THINK WHAT WE DO -- I ALREADY

605
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
RUN A BEREAVEMENT GROUP FOR

606
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST CHILDREN.

607
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT.

608
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
WE WILL PROBABLY ADAPT IT MORE

609
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
SPECIFICALLY TO THOSE WHO MAY

610
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
NEED IT RIGHT AWAY.

611
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T NEED GRIEF

612
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
COUNSELING RIGHT AWAY.

613
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
THEY NEED TO HAVE A CHANCE TO

614
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
JUST SORT OF SETTLE DOWN AND LET

615
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
REALITY SET IN.

616
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
AFTER EVERYBODY LEAVES THERE IS

617
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
GOING TO BE A HUGE CRASH.

618
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
>> THAT IS WHAT I JUST MENTIONED

619
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
WHEN I WAS WALKING THROUGH TOWN.

620
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT US TO GO.

621
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

622
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING WANT TO

623
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
BE HERE AND THEY CAN ONLY BE

624
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
HERE THROUGH THE MEDIA SO WE

625
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
FEEL WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY.

626
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
WE WANT TO LEAVE AND WANT TO LET

627
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
PEOPLE GET BACK TO NORMAL.

628
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
WHEN WE LEAVE I THINK THERE WILL

629
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
BE AN ENORMOUS VACUUM AND QUIET

630
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
THUD OF SILENCE AND PAIN.

631
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
THE PEOPLE OF COLUMBINE SAID

632
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
THEY WANTED TO MOVE AWAY.

633
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
THEY SAID THEY WANTED TO LEAVE

634
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
LITTLETON, COLORADO.

635
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
AND IN THE END ULTIMATELY ALL

636
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
STAYED TOGETHER AND FOUND SO

637
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
MUCH COMFORT AND SUPPORT IN

638
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
BEING A GROUP.

639
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
IS THERE SOMETHING TO THAT IN

640
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
KNOWING THAT THERE ARE OTHER

641
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
PEOPLE AROUND YOU WHO KNOW

642
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE GOING

643
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
THROUGH?
>> DEFINITELY.

644
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
EVERYBODY'S FIRST REACTION IS TO

645
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
RETURN HOME TO ANOTHER HOME.

646
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
>> SOME OTHER HOME.

647
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

648
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
EVEN AFTER 9/11 I DID A LOT OF

649
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
STRESS DEBRIEFING.

650
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
PEOPLE WANTED TO GO BACK TO

651
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
THEIR NATIVE COUNTRIES WHERE

652
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
HERE INITIALLY PEOPLE MAY WANT

653
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
TO LEAVE BUT I THINK IT WILL BE

654
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
VERY HELPFUL TO BAND TOGETHER.

655
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
>> I HAVE TO ASK YOU FOR THOSE

656
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
WHO SURVIVED AND FOR THOSE

657
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
PEOPLE IN TOWN WHO KNOW WHEN

658
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
THEY GO TO THE BANK AND CAFE AND

659
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
WALK THROUGH TOWN THEY ARE GOING

660
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
TO EVERY DAY ENCOUNTER SOMEONE

661
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
WHO LOST SOMEONE.

662
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO REACT?

663
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO

664
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
WHEN THEY SEE THESE VICTIMS AND

665
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE YEARS TO

666
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
COME?
>> ALL THEY NEED TO DO IS TO SAY

667
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I AM HERE AND I AM THINKING OF

668
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
YOU.
NOTHING ELSE.

669
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
>> BUT TO BRING IT UP.

670
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
>> BRING IT UP JUST TO SAY I AM

671
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
HERE.

672
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK ANY

673
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
PERSONAL QUESTIONS OR HOW YOU

674
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
ARE DOING.

675
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
WHAT THEY SHOW AND WHAT THEY

676
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
TELL YOU IS NOT REALLY WHAT IS

677
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
GOING ON.
IT IS A BROKEN HEART.

678
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I THINK WHAT THEY WILL DO IS SAY

679
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I AM HERE AND I AM THINKING

680
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
ABOUT YOU.
THAT IS IT.

681
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
>> I AM SO SORRY FOR WHAT YOUR

682
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
TOWN IS GOING THROUGH AND WILL

683
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH.

684
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I WISH YOWL THE BEST OF LUCK IN

685
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
MANAGING THIS CRISIS.

686
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
>> I THINK WE WILL GROW AND HEAL

687
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
AS WE ARE GROWING.

688
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
>> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE

689
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
TODAY AND FOR HELPING US TO SORT

690
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
THROUGH HOW THIS IS GOING TO

691
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
TRANSPIRE.
THERE IS A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE

692
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
DONE.

693
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
IF YOU WANT INFORMATION ON HOW

694
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
YOU CAN PAY TRIBUTE FOR THE

695
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
VICTIMS OF THE NEWTOWN SHOOTING

696
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
WE INVITE YOU TO GO TO

697
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
CNN.COM/IMPACT.

698
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
THERE ARE PLENTY OF SUGGESTIONS

699
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
ON WHAT YOU CAN DO TO FEEL LIKE

700
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
YOU ARE INVOLVED.

701
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
TAKE TYLENOL OR TAKE ALEVE,

702
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
THE #1 RECOMMENDED PAIN
RELIEVER BY ORTHOPEDIC DOCTORS.

703
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
JUST TWO ALEVE
CAN KEEP PAIN AWAY ALL DAY.

704
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
BACK TO THE NEWS.

705
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
>>> SOME BUSINESS OUT OF

706
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
WASHINGTON TO BRING YOUR WAY.

707
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
THERE HAS BEEN SOME MOVEMENT.

708
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I SAY SOME MOVEMENT ON THE PLANS

709
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
TO AVOID THE FISCAL CLIFF.

710
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
AND WHEN I SAY SOME MOVEMENT IT

711
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
MEANS PLAN B BECAUSE REPUBLICANS

712
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
ARE APPARENTLY READYING

713
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
SOMETHING TO CONSIDER PLAN B TO

714
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
TRY TO AVOID GOING OFF THE

715
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
FISCAL CLIFF.
WE ARE COUNTING DOWN TWO WEEKS

716
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
UNTIL THE DEADLINE.

717
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
THE DEAL HAS TO BE MADE BEFORE

718
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
THEN.
THE REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING THAT

719
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
A COUNTEROFFER CAME THEIR WAY

720
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA ON TAXES

721
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
AND SPENDING AS QUOTE NOT THERE

722
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
YET.
DANA BASH JOINS ME LIVE FROM

723
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
CAPITOL HILL.
I KNOW THAT THE SPEAKER OF THE

724
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
HOUSE SPOKE JUST LAST HOUR ABOUT

725
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
HIS CONCERNS AND THOUGHTS MOVING

726
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
FORWARD.

727
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
ARE WE GETTING ANYTHING OTHER

728
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
THAN RHETORIC AND PLATITUDES?

729
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
ARE WE FINDING FURTHER MOVEMENT

730
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
AHEAD?

731
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
>> Reporter: WE ARE DEFINITELY

732
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
GETTING A LOT OF RHETORIC AND

733
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
PLATITUDES.

734
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
HIGH STAKES POSITIONING AND

735
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
TACTICAL POSITIONING RIGHT NOW

736
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
AS WE GET CLOSER TO THAT

737
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
DEADLINE.
BUT BIG PICTURE OF WHAT IS GOING

738
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
ON IS THAT THE HOUSE SPEAKER

739
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
WENT INTO A MEETING AND

740
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
ANNOUNCED HE WAS GOING TO MOVE

741
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
FORWARD TO PLAN B.

742
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
WHAT IS PLAN B?

743
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
HE FEELS THAT THE TALKS HE HAS

744
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
HAD WITH THE PRESIDENT HAVE

745
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
STALLED.

746
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
HE IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH OF WHAT

747
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
HE WANTS IN TERMS OF SPENDING

748
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
CUTS AND TOO MUCH WHEN IT COMES

749
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
TO TAX REVENUE.

750
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
PLAN B WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE

751
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
EVERYBODY'S TAXES DON'T GO UP.

752
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
IT WOULD BE LEGISLATION TO KEEP

753
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
TAXES WHERE THEY ARE FOR PEOPLE

754
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
MAKING $1 MILLION AND LESS.

755
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
LISTEN TO WHAT HE TOLD REPORTERS

756
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
AFTERWARDS.
>> AT THE SAME TIME WE WILL

757
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THE

758
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
PRESIDENT WE ARE GOING TO ALSO

759
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
MOVE PLAN B.

760
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT EVERY

761
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
INCOME TAX FILER IN AMERICA IS

762
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
GOING TO PAY HIGHER RATES COME

763
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
JANUARY 1 UNLESS CONGRESS ACTS.

764
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
SO I BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT

765
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
THAT WE PROTECT AS MANY AMERICAN

766
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
TAXPAYERS AS WE CAN.

767
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
AND OUR PLAN B WOULD PROTECT

768
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
AMERICAN TAXPAYERS WHO MAKE $1

769
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
MILLION OR LESS AND HAVE ALL OF

770
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
THEIR CURRENT RATES EXTENDED.

771
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
>> Reporter: AS WE WERE TALKING,

772
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALLY

773
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
RELEASED THE STATEMENT REJECTING

774
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
THE SO-CALLED PLAN B LEGISLATION

775
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
AND THAT IS NOT A SURPRISE

776
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
BECAUSE IT IS IN KEEPING WITH

777
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM

778
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
DEMOCRATS.

779
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
SENIOR DEMOCRATS WHO LAUGHED

780
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
THIS OFF AS A JOKE.

781
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
ONE SENIOR DEMOCRAT SAID THIS IS

782
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
A PUNCH LINE, NOT A COMPROMISE.

783
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THE

784
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
PRESIDENT IN RECENT DAYS HAS

785
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
MOVED MORE TOWARDS THE SPEAKER

786
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
THAN EVEN MANY IN THE

787
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
PRESIDENT'S OWN PARTY WANT HIM

788
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
TO AND THAT THE SPEAKER SIMPLY

789
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
CAN'T DEAL WITH THE PRESSURE

790
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
THAT HE IS GETTING FROM FELLOW

791
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
REPUBLICANS.
THERE ARE CERTAINLY A LOT OF

792
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
ISSUES GOING ON HERE BUT RIGHT

793
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THE

794
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO PUSH

795
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
FORWARD ON TAKING THIS VOTE

796
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
PROBABLY ON THURSDAY AND BY ALL

797
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
ACCOUNTS IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE

798
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
IT WILL GET THE VOTES TO PASS.

799
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
>> AS YOU WERE SPEAKING ACTUALLY

800
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I JUST GOT THIS STATEMENT HERE.

801
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
LET ME READ FOR OUR AUDIENCE IF

802
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I CAN.

803
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS PUT A BALANCED

804
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
REASONABLE PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE

805
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
THAT ACHIEVES SIGNIFICANT

806
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
DEFICIT REDUCTION AND REFLECTS

807
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
REAL COMPROMISE BY MEETING THE

808
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
REPUBLICANS HALF WAY ON REVENUE

809
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
AND MORE THAN HALF WAY ON

810
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
SPENDING FROM WHERE EACH SIDE

811
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
STARTED.
THE PARAMETERS OF THE DEAL ARE

812
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
CLEAR AND THE PRESIDENT IS

813
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
WILLING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

814
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
REPUBLICANS TO REACH A

815
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
BIPARTISAN SOLUTION THAT AVERTS

816
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
THE FISCAL CLIFF, PROTECTS THE

817
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
MIDDLE CLASS AND PUTS OUR NATION

818
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
ON A FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE PATH

819
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
BUT HE IS NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT

820
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
A DEAL THAT DOESN'T ASK ENOUGH

821
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
OF THE VERY WEALTHIEST IN TAXES

822
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
AND INSTEAD SHIFTATHIZE BURDEN

823
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
TO THE MIDDLE CLASS.

824
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
THE PLAN B APPROACH DOESN'T MEET

825
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
THIS TEST BECAUSE IT CAN'T PASS

826
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
THE SENATE AND WILL NOT PROTECT

827
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
THE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AND

828
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
DOES LITTLE TO ADDRESS OUR

829
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
FISCAL CHALLENGES WITH ZERO

830
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
SPENDING CUTS.

831
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
THE PRESIDENT IS HOPEFUL TO

832
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
REACH A SOLUTION SO WE DON'T

833
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
MISS THE OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF

834
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
US TODAY.

835
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
SO THERE IS THAT.

836
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN CALL

837
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
THAT PLATITUDES AND RHETORIC.

838
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF THE

839
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
SAME.
CAN I GET QUICK REACTION FROM

840
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
YOU ON THE STATEMENT?

841
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
>> Reporter: I THINK IT WOULD

842
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
SERVE THE VIEWERS WELL TO SHOW

843
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
THE GIST OF WHERE THE PRESIDENT

844
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
WAS LAST NIGHT WHEN HE MET WITH

845
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
THE HOUSE SPEAKER ON THE BIG

846
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
PICTURE NEGOTIATIONS, WHAT HE

847
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
OFFERED BECAUSE HE DID OFFER

848
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
SOME THINGS THAT HE BEFORE VOWED

849
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
HE NEVER WOULD.

850
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
HE IS MOVING TOWARDS THE SPEAKER

851
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
IN SOME WAYS.

852
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
ON THE TAX RATES FOR THE

853
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS PRESIDENT

854
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
CAMPAIGNED FOR FIVE YEARS SAYING

855
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
THEY WOULD GO UP FOR EVERYONE

856
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
MAKING $250,000 OR MORE.

857
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
LAST NIGHT HE OFFERED TO MOVE

858
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
THAT LEVEL UP TO $400,000.

859
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
HE ALSO OFFERED WHAT THE WHITE

860
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
HOUSE CALLS $1.2 TRILLION IN

861
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
SPENDING CUTS.

862
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
THE REPUBLICANS QUIBBLED WITH

863
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
THAT.
THEY SAID THE MATH DOESN'T ADD

864
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
UP.

865
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
REGARDLESS THAT IS A LOT MORE IN

866
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
SPENDING CUTS THAN THEY WOULD

867
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
HAVE AGREED TO AND THAT IS

868
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
COMING THE SPEAKER'S WAY.

869
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
AND THE OTHER THING THAT THE

870
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
PRESIDENT OFFERED WAS TO EXTEND

871
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
THE DEBT LIMIT SO THAT THAT IS

872
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
NOT A FIGHT THAT DRAWS EVERYBODY

873
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
INTO THE SAME POSITION WE ARE IN

874
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
NOW.
THAT IS SORT OF PART OF WHERE

875
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GOING.

876
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
AS YOU HEARD FROM THE SOUND BYTE

877
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
HE IS ARGUING HE SAID MORE

878
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
IMPORTANTLY TO HIS FELLOW

879
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
REPUBLICANS IN PRIVATE THIS

880
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
MORNING THAT THAT SIMPLY IS NOT

881
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
ENOUGH WHEN IT COMES TO

882
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
SPENDING.
LET ME GIVE YOU A REALITY CHECK

883
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
HERE.
SO MUCH OF THIS IS POSTURING AND

884
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
IS A NEGOTIATED TACTIC SAYING TO

885
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
THE PRESIDENT I NEED YOU TO COME

886
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
FURTHER MY WAY OR ELSE WE ARE

887
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
GOING TO HAVE THIS VOTE.

888
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
HE ALSO PROBABLY NEEDS TO DO

889
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
THAT FOR HIS OWN PEOPLE TO SHOW

890
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
THAT THE FALL BACK PLAN DOESN'T

891
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
HAVE THE VOTES TO PASS.

892
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
>> DANA BASH LIVE FOR US ON

895

OUR WAY AT THAT TIME.

896
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
LET'S HOPE THE SENATE LEADERS

897
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
HAVE BEEN A ABLE TO CALL THEIR

898
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
FAMILIES BECAUSE THEY ARE

899
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
WARNING LAWMAKERS THAT THEY

900
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
COULD BE WORKING THROUGH TO
CHRISTMAS AND COME BACK THE NEXT

901
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000

907
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000

CHOOSE ANY CAR IN THE AISLE.

THE MID-SIZE PRICE.

911
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000

00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
WAY THAT OTHERS AREN'T AT THIS

928
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
TIME SUGGESTING THAT YOU SHOULD

929
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
BE ABLE TO CARRY A GUN INTO

930
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
SCHOOL IF YOU ARE AN

931
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
ADMINISTRATOR YOU SHOULD BE ABLE

932
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
TO PROTECT YOURSELF.

933
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
AT THIS TIME THE NRA ITSELF

934
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
ISN'T WEIGHING IN.

935
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
EVERYTHING IS QUIET ON THAT

936
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
FRONT.
THEY ARE WAITING, AS THEY SAID,

937
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
UNTIL THEY GET ALL THE FACTS

938
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
BEFORE THEY COMMENT ON WHAT HAS

939
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
HAPPENED HERE IN NEWTOWN,

940
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
CONNECTICUT.
IF IT SEEMS LIKE PUBLIC OPINION

941
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
IS SHIFTING PERHAPS IT IS.

942
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
SOME OF THE LATEST POLLING

943
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
SUGGESTS IT HAS SHIFTED SOMEWHAT

944
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
IN TERMS OF MORE PRO GUN CONTROL

945
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000

DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS CHANGING

946
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000

947
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND DON'T

948
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
SUPPORT ADDITIONAL GUN CONTROL.

949
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
WHAT ABOUT THE NATIONAL RIFLE

950
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
ASSOCIATION AND WHEN IT DOES

951
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
BEGIN TO WEIGH IN?

952
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
IT IS A VERY POWERFUL LOBBY.

953
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
IS ANYTHING STANDING IN ITS WAY

954
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000

SHOWING AND TELLING THEIR LOVE

959
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000

DEMOCRATS RUN ON GUNS, TOO.

>> AS YOUR SENATOR I WILL

967
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT

SLAUGHTERED?

977
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
IT HAS CHANGED ME.
I DON'T KNOW OF ANYBODY THAT

978
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
GOES HUNTING WITH AN ASSAULT

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000

DON'T COUNT ON THE NRA JUST YET.

992
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
THEY'RE LYING LOW.

993
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T WIN AN

994
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
ARGUMENT WHEN THE EMOTION OF THE

995
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
SUBJECT IS COMPLETELY TILTED TO

996
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
THE OPPOSITION.

997
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
IT IS WHY HE SAYS SO FAR THE NRA

998
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
HAS NOT COMMENTED ON SANDY

999
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
POINT.
IT IS THE SAME STRATEGY THE NRA

1000
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
USED AFTER CONGRESS WOMAN

1001
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
GABRIELLE GIFFORDS WAS SHOT.

1002

THE GUN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION

1005
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
SPENT MORE ON LOBBYING IN 2011

1006
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
THAN IT EVER HAD.

1007
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
$2.5 MILLION.

1008
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
AND IT PROMOTED PERSONAL SAFETY

1009
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
THROUGH GUN OWNERSHIP LIKE IT

1010
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
DID FOLLOWING BOB COSTAS'S

1011
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
PASSIONATE PLEA FOR GUN CONTROL

1012
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000

GIRLFRIEND AND THEN HIMSELF.

1014
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
>> HE WOULDN'T HAVE SAID A THING

1015

IF THIS WOMAN SAVED HER LIFE BY

1016
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000

VERY INTERESTING PIECE THAT YOU

PUT TOGETHER.

1027
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I AM CURIOUS ABOUT THE HISTORY

1028
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
OF THE NRA'S REACTIONS AFTER

1029
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
MASS SHOOTINGS.

1030
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
WHAT IS THE TYPICAL M.O. OF THE

1031
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
NRA AFTER THESE TRAGEDIES?

1032
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
>> IN A WORD, NOTHING.

1033
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
THE NRA DOESN'T COMMENT.

1034
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
WHY SHOULD THEY?

1035
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
YOU CAN'T WIN THIS ARGUMENT WITH

1036
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
THE SPECTER OF 20 DEAD CHILDREN

1037
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000

AS PAINFUL AS IT SOUNDS RIGHT

1039
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
NOW, MEMORIES FADE.

1040
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
SIX MONTHS FROM NOW PEOPLE WILL

1041
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
LIKELY FEEL VERY DIFFERENTLY

1042
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
ABOUT WHAT WENT DOWN IN NEWTOWN.

1043
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
THE NRA PROBABLY WON'T COMMENT

1044
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
THEN EITHER BUT IT WON'T NEED TO

1045
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
BECAUSE ROUGHLY HALF THE

1046
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
POPULATION STILL THINKS THE

1047
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
ANSWERS TO TRAGEDIES IS MORE

1048
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000

>> SO, CAROL, WHAT ABOUT THE

1050
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
POWER OF THE NRA AS A LOBBY?

1051
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
EVERYONE KNOWS IT IS

1052
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
SIGNIFICANT.
YOU SAW SOME OF THE CAMPAIGN

1053
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
PICTURES.

1054
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
WHAT KIND OF POWER ARE WE

1055
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
TALKING ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO

1056
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
MONEY AND NUMBERS?

1057
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
>> IT IS NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE

1058
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
MONEY.
THE NRA HAS MILLIONS OF MEMBERS,

1059
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
4 MILLION MEMBERS OR MORE.

1060
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
THAT IS LIKE HAVING 4 MILLION

1061

VOTES IN YOUR POCKET.

1062
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
SO LEGISLATORS, LAWMAKERS ARE

1063
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
ELECTED AND KNOW THAT.

1064
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT REAL

1065
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
VOTES THEY MAY LOSE IF THEY PASS

1066
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION.

1067
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
