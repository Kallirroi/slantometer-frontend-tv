624
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
THEY CLINCHED A WILD CARD SPOT

625
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
IN THE PLAYOFFS.

626
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
>> WE KNEW WE WERE GOING TO

627
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
HAVE TO PUT UP POINTS.

628
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
TOM BRADY AND THE OFFENSE CAN

THAT.

632
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
>> THEY WERE A VERY GOOD TEAM

633
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
AND A VERY GOOD DEFENSE.

634
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
THEY PLAY HARD.

635
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
WE SPOTTED THEM 28 POINTS.

636
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
YOU CAN'T PLAY POORLY AGAINST

637
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
A GOOD TEAM AND EXPECT TO

638
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000

639
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
>> WE CAN WIN A SHOOTOUT.

640
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

641
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000

HE GOES 57 YARDS THE OTHER

649
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000

650
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
THEY FACE THE SEAHAWKS NEXT

651
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000

652
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
THEY CAN CLINCH WITH A WIN.

653
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
A LOSS AND IT COMES DOWN TO

656
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
WE WILL TAKE A BRIEF TIMEOUT

657
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
BEFORE WE JUMP OVER TO THE

658
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000

SOMETHING WHERE THEY GET A

690
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
LITTLE CONFIDENCE.

691
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I THOUGHT THEY HAD A GREAT

692
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
WEEK OF PRACTICE.

693
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
ON WHAT WEED -- WHAT WE NEEDED

695
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
A GREAT JOB EXECUTING THEM

697
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000

1226
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
THEY BEAT KANSAS CITY AND TWO

1227
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000

HE RAD FOR 110 YARDS AND ON 30

RAIDERS' DEFENSE SHUT ON THE

1238
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000

THE FIRST ONE SINCE 2002 FOR

1239
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
THE SILVER AND BLACK.

1240
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
RAIDERS SNAP THE SKID BEHIND

1241
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
JANIKOWSKI'S FIVE FIELD

1242
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000

1243
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
>> I THINK OUR GUYS NEEDED

1244
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000

00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
WEEK OF PRACTICE.

1247
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I THOUGHT THEY WERE FOCUSED ON

1248

WHAT WOO WE NEEDED TO DO AND

1249
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000

ENOUGH.

1265
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
A 29-17 VICTORY.

1266
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
DENVER LOCKED UP THE AFC

1268
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
THEY MADE A STATEMENT THOUGH.

1269
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
IT IS A LONG WAY.

1270
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
