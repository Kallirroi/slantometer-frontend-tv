00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
MORNING.
WE'RE ON THE AIR LIVE AT 10:15

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
EASTERN TIME.
THE NEWS JUST STARTED TO COME

193
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
ACROSS THE WIRE, AND FRANKLY

194
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
AT THE TIME WERE TOLD ONE

195
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
FOOT AND BEING TREATED IN A

197
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
LOCAL HOSPITAL.

198
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
THERE IS VERY LITTLE NEWS

199
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
AFTER THAT.

200
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
THAT WENT ON FOR A

201
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME.

202
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
45 NINZ HOUR WE STARTED

203
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
LEARNING ABOUT THIS, NOW, WHEN

204
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
YOU GO BACK AND PIECE TOGETHER

205
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
THIS IN YOUR MIND, THE REASON

206
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
FOR THAT IS OBVIOUS NOW.

207
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THERE WERE NO OTHER INJURIES.

208
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
WERE JUST DEAD BODIES INSIDE

209
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
OF THE SCHOOL HERE IN

210
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
CONNECTICUT.

211
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
THE POLICE WERE THERE, JUST

212
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
ABSORBING THIS INFORMATION

213
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
GOING THROUGH FROM ROOM TO

214
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
ROOM.

215
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

216
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
THE KILLER THE GUNMAN, WAS

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
ACCOUNTED FOR AND NO ONE ELSE

218
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
IS INSIDE.

219
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
WE'VE BEEN TELD NOW MANY OF

220
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
THE CHILDREN WERE TOLD TO

221
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
CLOSE THEIR EYES AND RUN.

222
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
TO GET OUT OF THE BUILDING AND

223
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
MAKE SURE THEY DID NOT LOOK

224
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
AROUND WHERE THEY WERE.

225
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I SPOKE TO A WOMAN ABOUT AN

226
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
HOUR AGO. SHE HAS A DAUGHTER

227
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
WHO IS OKAY.

228
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
SHE TOLD HER MOTHER THEY WERE

229
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
LET OUT OF THE BACK DOOR OF

230
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
THE SCHOOL TO MAKE SURE THAT

231
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
THEY DID NOT PASS BY ANY OF

232
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
THE DEAD CHILDREN WHO ARE

233
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
LYING THERE ON THE CLASSROOMS.

234
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
WHERE THEY HAD GONE TO SCHOOL

235
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
HERE, THESE STORIES ARE JUST

236
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
SO CHILLING, SEAN.

237
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
>> SEAN: I'VE HEARD INTO THAT.

238
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000

242
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
>> SEAN: I DON'T THINK I CAN

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
SAY IT ANY BETTER THAN THAT,

244
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
BILL.

245
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THE IDEA SOME OF THE KIDS WERE

246
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
TOLD TO CLOSE YOUR EYES, AS

247
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000

MENTIONED.

252
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
THAT AS THE SHOOTER WAS

253
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
SHOOTING HE GRABBED HIS

254
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
FRIENDS AND HE RAN OUT OF THE

255
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
CLASSROOM.

256
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
ANOTHER, A CUSTODIAN RUNNING

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
UP AND DOWN THE HALLS TO WARN

258
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
PEOPLE.

259
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
WE HAVE A TEACHER NUMEROUS

260
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
STORIES OF TEACHERS HIDING

261
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
KIDS IN CLOSETS AND DOING

262
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
EVERYTHING THEY CAN DO, AND

263
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
LOCKING INDOORS AND LOCKING

264
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
DOORS, ONE TEACHER INTERVIEWED

265
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
TONIGHT.
I WANT TO PLAY THAT FOR YOU.

266
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
>> I TOOK ONE OF MY STUDENTS

267
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
ON TOP OF THE TOILET.

268
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I KNEW WE HAD TO GET IN THERE.

269
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
TELLING THEM IT'S GOING TO BE

270
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
OKAY.

271
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

272
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I PULLED A BOOK SHELF IN FRONT

273
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
OF IT.
WE WERE BARRICADED AND I

274
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
TURNED LIGHTS OFF.

275
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
>> DID YOU TELL THEM TO BE

276
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
QUIET?
>> I TOLD THEM.

277
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
BE QUIET.

278
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
WE HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTELY QUIET

279
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
BECAUSE I WAS JUST AFRAID IF

280
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
HE DID COME IN, HE WOULD HEAR

281
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
US AND START SHOOTING THE

282
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
DOOR.

283
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I SAID JUST BE ABSOLUTELY

284
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
QUIET.

285
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I SAID THERE ARE BAD GUYS OUT

286
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
THERE.

287
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
WE NEED TO WAIT FOR THE GOOD

288
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
GUYS.

289
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
AND I JUST -- HIDE.

290
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I WANTED US TO BE OKAY.

291
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
AND I AM SO SADDENED THERE ARE

292
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
PEOPLE WHO, IN THIS SITUATION,

293
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
ARE NOT OKAY.

294
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO

295
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
ANYONE WHO KNEW THEM.

296
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
AND WAS PART OF THEIR LIVES.

297
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I KNLT IMAGINE.

298
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
-- CAN'T IMAGINE.
>> SEAN: IT'S HARD TO CALL TO

299
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
GRIP WAS THIS EVIL.

300
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
THESE PARENTS, I'M SURE MANY

301
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
OF THEM HAVE BOUGHT CHRISTMAS

302
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
GIFTS FOR LITTLE CHILDREN.

303
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
AND NOW, THEY'RE PLANNING

304
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
FUNERALS AND CHRISTMAS EVE AND

305
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
CHRISTMAS DAY IS GOING TO

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
COME.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE

307
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
THEIR KIDS HOME.

308
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
>> YOU KNOW, SEAN, A FEW OTHER

309
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
THINGS.

310
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
WE'RE JUST NOW LEARNING ABOUT

311
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
THE VICTIMS.

312
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
AND THIS IS GOING TO BE THE

313
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
NEXT WAVE IN THIS STORY.

314
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
IF YOU THINK IT'S SAD NOW,

315
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
HANG ON.

316
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
BECAUSE NOW, WE'RE GOING TO

317
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
MEET THE PEOPLE WHO WERE

318
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
KILLED INSIDE OF THE BUILDING.

319
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
WE'RE TOLD THE PRINCIPAL,

320
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000

DISTRICT YEARS.

322
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE HER NAME

323
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000

IT HAS NOT BEEN MADE PUBLIC

324
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
YET.
AGE 47.

325
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
TWO DAUGHTERS AND SHE LEAVES

326
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
THEM BEHIND.

327
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
A HUSBAND.

328
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
AND AND I EXPECT STATE POLICE

INSIDE OF THE BUILDING.

332
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I MENTIONED THIS EARLIER.

333
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
WHEN YOU'RE FIVE YEARS OLD,

334
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
YOU ARE 10, 11 DIAS WAY FROM

THIS TOWN HAS TO LIVE WITH IT

340
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

341
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
>> WE APPRECIATE IT THIS, IS

342
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
NOW THE SECOND DEADLIEST

343
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
SHOOTING IN U.S. HISTORY.

344
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
THE INVESTIGATION IS UNDERWAY.

345
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
A SOURCE JUST TOLD THE AP TWO

346
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
GUNS WERE FOUND INSIDE OF THE

347
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
SCHOOL.

348
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
WE'LL UPDATE WHEN YOU WE

349
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
RETURN TWO, VETERAN LAW

350
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
ENFORCEMENT MEMBERS WILL JOIN

351
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
ME TO WALK US THROUGH DAY AS

352
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
HEAD WAS AZ WE CONTINUE OUR

353
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
COVERAGE HERE ON THE FOX NEWS

354
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
CHANNEL.
Sometimes what we suffer from

355
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Is bigger than we think ...
like the flu.

356
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
With aches, fever and chills-
the flu's a really big deal.

357
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So why treat it like
it's a little cold?

358
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
There's something
that works differently

359
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
than over-the-counter
remedies.

360
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Prescription TAMIFLU attacks
the flu virus at its source.

361
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So don't wait. Call your
doctor right away.

362
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
TAMIFLU is prescription
medicine for treating the flu

363
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
in adults and children
one year and older

364
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
whose flu symptoms started
within the last two days.

365
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Before taking TAMIFLU tell your
doctor if you're pregnant,

366
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
nursing. have serious
health conditions,

367
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
or take other medicines.

368
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
If you develop an allergic
reaction, a severe rash,

369
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
or signs of unusual behavior,

370
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
stop taking TAMIFLU and call
your doctor immediately.

371
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Children and adolescents in
particular may be at an

372
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
increased risk
of seizures, confusion

373
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
or abnormal behavior.

374
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The most common

The flu comes on fast,

377
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000

doctor about TAMIFLU.

IT TAKES TIME.

1290
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
>> IT COMES BACK.

1291
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
AND I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH

1292
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
THIS SAFE SCHOOL THING AND SEE

1293
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
SOMETHING NOTIFY.

1294
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
AND CALL NUMBER THERE.

1295
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
AND IT IS COMING DOWN.

1296
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I GET CALLS IN THE OFFICE.

1297
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
SCHOOLS NOW ARING FOR OFF DUTY

1298
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
COPS WITH A GUN.

1299
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
LET'S BE HONEST IF A GUY HAD A

1300
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
GUN, HE MIGHT HAVE KILLED SOME

1301
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
PEOPLE YOU WOULD AT LEAST BE

1302
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
ABLE TO LIMIT IT.

1303
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
>> THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

1304
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
>> THAT'S WHY THEY TARGET

1305
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
SCHOOL SYSTEMS.
>> IT IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO

1306
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
IT.

1307
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
THESE ARE PRECIOUS THINGINGS.

1308
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
WE'LL PAY FOR A RETIRED COP

1309
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
WITH A GUN SO ONE OF THESE

1310
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
PUNKS COME IN.

1311
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
HE WILL NOT HAVE FREE WILL.

1312
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
IF HE HAD MORE BULLETS AND

1313
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
TIME, HE COULD HAVE KILLED

1314
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
MORE UNTIL THOSE COPS GOT

1315
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
THERE.
IT IS HORRIFIC.

1316
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
>> I THINK WE ARE HEADED THERE

1317
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
ESPECIALLY COPS IN NEW YORK.

1318
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
>> I THINK IT IS IT GREAT.

1319
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
BUT THE GOOD NEWS, KIDS ARE
