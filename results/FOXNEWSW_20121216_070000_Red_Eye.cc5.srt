THE SCHOOL.

NOT UNEXPECTED DETAILS.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
WE KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO BE

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
HORRIBLE BUT THE EXTENT OF THE

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
DETAIL WAS CLINICAL.

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
NEARLY ALL OF THE VICTIMS HAD

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
MULTIPLE GUN HOT.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
THREE-LEN GUN SHOT WOUNDS AND

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
THOSE ARE THE FOLKS HE HAD A

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
CHANCE TO EXAMINE HIMSELF.

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
HE PARTICIPATED IN 7 OF THE

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
EXAMS PERSONALLY.

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THE PAPERWORK IS COMPLETED AND

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
NOW, IT IS TIME FOR THE

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
FAMILIES TO HAVE A CHANCE TO

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
SEE THEIR LOVED ONES AND

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000

AND MEMORIAL SERVICES AND A

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
VERY LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY FOR

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THE COMMUNITY.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
GOVERNOR.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
>> MOLLY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
>> MAYBE IT IS SIMPLEP THE

94

ATTEMPT TO EXPRESS OUR

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
COLLECTIVE SHOCK WHEN WE SAY

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THE HORRIFIC SHOOTING IN THE

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
SANDY HOOKS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
IT IS IT NOT SENSE TO A

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
RATIONAL HUMAN BEING.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
THE GOVERNOR MALLOY GOT IT

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
RIGHT WHEN HE SAID ERIL

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
VISITED THE COMMUNITY.

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE MORE AS

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
A PARENT THAN A POLITICIAN AND

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
QUOTED THE BIBLE TO BRING

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
COMFORT TO THE NATION.

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
CHURCHES WERE FILLED IN

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT LAST

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
NIGHT AS CANDLELIGHT VIGILS

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
WERE HELD TO GRIEVE FOR THE 27

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
INNOCENT PEOPLE KILLED AND

113
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
THOSE SHATTERED BY THE CRAZED

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
CARNAGE.

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
ON FRIDAY, NEAL CAVUTED ME,

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
WHERE WAS GOD IN WE HAVE

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
SYSTEMATICALLY REMOVED GOD

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
FROM OUR SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
ACCOUNT ACTIVITIES AND AT THE

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
MOMENT OF THE CALAMITY WE

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
WONDER WHERE IT WAS.

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
THE LIBERAL WAVE HAD A VIOLENT

123
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
AND JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
THAT IF I SAID PRAYER WAS IN

125
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
SCHOOL THE SHOOTING WOULD NOT

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
HAVE HAPPEN.

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I SAID NOTHING OF THE SORT.

128
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
IT IS FAR MORE THAN PRAYER AND

129
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
BIBLE READING.
IT IS IT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
SUE A CITY SO WE HAVE NO MAJOR

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
16 OR CHRISTMAS CAROL CHURCHES

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
AND CHRISTIAN OWNED BUSINESSES

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
ARE TOLD TO SURRENDER THE

134
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
VALUES UNDER THE EDICT OF THE

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
GOVERNMENT ORDERS TO PROVIDE

136
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
TAX-FUNDED ABORTION PILLS .

137
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
WE SAY THINGS ARE SINFUL AND

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
SAY THEY ARE DISORDERS AND

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
SOMETIMES WE SAY THEY ARE

140
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
NORMAL AND HAVE TO ABANDON BED

141
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
ROCK MEMIORAL TRUTHS, WE WERE,

142
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
WHERE WAS GOD?

143
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
WHY ESCORTED HIM OUT OF OUR

144
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
CULTURE AND MARCHED HIM OUT OF

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THE PUBLIC SQUARE AND THEN

146
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
SURPRISED THAT A CULTURE

147
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
REFLECTS WHAT IT IS IT BECOME.

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
AS SOON AS THE TRAGEDY

149
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
UNFOLDED HE SHOWED UP.

150
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
IN THE LIVES OF TEACHERS WHO

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
PUT THEIR LIVES BETWEEN THE

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
GUNMEN AND THE STUDENTS AND IN

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
POLICEMEN WHO RUSH SCHOOL NOT

154
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
KNOWING IF THEY WOULD BE MET

155
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
WITH A BARAGE OF STUDENTS.

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
AND HUGS AND TIERCE OF PARENTS

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
AND TEACHERS THAT LIVED

158
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
THROUGH THE SLAUGHTER AND

159
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
OVERFLOWED CHURCH SERVICES

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
WHERE PEOPLE LIT CANDLES AND

161
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
PRAYED HE SHOWED UP IN THE

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
WHITE HOUSE WHERE THE

163
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
PRESIDENT ENVOKED HIS NAME AND

164
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
QUOTED FROM HIS BOOK THEN IN A

165
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
FEW DAYS, WE'LL GOD TO EXCUSE

166
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
HIMSELF.
AND ANNOUNCE IN OUR ARROGANT

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
PRIDE THAT WE HAVE EVOLVED

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
BEYOND NEEDING HIM AND SOMEONE

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
WILL SUGGEST WE HAVE A LAW TO

170
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
STOP THIS.
WE DON'T HAVE TO PASS A NEW

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
ONE.

172
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
THERE IS ONE THAT WORKS IF WE

173
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
TEACH AND OBSERVE IT.

174
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
SHAW SHALT NOT KILL.

175
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THERE ARE NINE OTHERS.

176
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
BUT TO TELL THEM ABOUT THAT

177
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
WOULD REQUIRE BRINGING GOD

178
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
BACK AND WE KNOW HOW

179
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
UNACCEPTABLE THAT MIGHT BE.

180
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
GERALDO RIVARY IS STANDING BY

181
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
IN NEWTOWN, BUT MORE

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
IMPORTANTLY GERALDO, I CAN'T

183
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
THINK OF ANY MAJOR AMERICAN

184
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
TRANNEL DEE THAT YOU HAVE NOT

185
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
SEEN UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL IN

186
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
THE LAST 40 YEARS.

187
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
HOW DOES THIS ONE COMPARE TO

188
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
THE TRAGIC EVENTS THAT YOU

189
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
COVER AS A REPORTER IN THE

190
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
GAY HIM TO ME.

378
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
>> OH, I CAN'T IMAGINE CHRIS

379
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
TEEN AS A PARENT.

380
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
IP JUST CAN'T GET MY ARMS

381
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
AROUND THE EMOTION THAT YOU

382
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
MUST HAVE HAD WHEN YOU SAW

383
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
YOUR SON WAS OKAY.

384
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I AM ASSUMING YOU GRABBED HIM

385
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
AND HUGGED HIM ALMOST TO THE

386
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
POINT OF SQUEEZING THE AIR OUT

387
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
OF HIM.

388
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
HE IS LIKE I AM OKAY.

389
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I DONE CRY.
I WAS BRAVE.

390
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
AND YOU KNOW, I AM OKAY.

391
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
AND I SAID OKAY.

392
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
AND PASSED HIM TO MY HUSBAND

393
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
SO HE COULD HUG HIM AND THEN

394
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
MY THOUGHTS WENT TO ONE OF MY

395
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
BEST FRIEND'S DAUGHTERS WHO I

396
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
KNEW WAS AT WORK AND I

397
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO LOOK

398
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
FOR HER AND FOUND HER AND TOOK

399
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
HER.

400
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
AND TOLD HER MANAGER ON THE

401
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
PHONE WITH HER MOTHER.

402
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
NTHAT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE HAPPY

403
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
CONVERSATION.

404
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
HAD THAT MOTHER KNOWN ABOUT

405
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
THE PHONE CALL.

406
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
YES, HAD KNOWN.

407
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
SHE HAD KNOWN.

408
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
SHE HAD CALL WOULD WHILE WE

409
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
WERE ON THE WAY TO THE SCHOOL.

410
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
HOW DO YOU IXPLAIN TO YOUR SON

411
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
WHAT HAPPENED.

412
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
THAT IS A HORRIBLE THING TO

413
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
EXPLAIN SOMETHING SO HEINOUS

414
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
AND EVIL TO A CHILD IN A WAY

415
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
THAT MAYBE HE COULD UNDERSTAND

416
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
IT.
>> WE JUST TOLD HIM THAT, THAT

417
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
VERY BAD MAN CAME IN THE

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000

419
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
PEOPLE.

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
AND WE FOUND OUT NAMES OF

421
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
PEOPLE THAT HE WAS FRIENDS

422
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
WITH AND KNEW, WE LET HIM

423
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
KNOW.
AND YOU KNOW.

424
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
KEEP CHECKING IN WITH HIM.

>> CHRIS TEEN, THERE IS NOT A

430
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
PARENT IN AMERICA THAT IS NOT

431
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
AM SOY GLAD YOU AND YOUR SON

432
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
ARE OKAY AND ALL OF YOUR

433
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
FAMILY.

434
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I KNOW IT IS A HARD TIME AND

435
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
YOU HAVE KNOWN TEACHERS AND

436
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
OTHER KIDS WHO ARE NOT OKAY.

437
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I APPRECIATE YOU LETTING US

438
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
INVADE YOUR PRIVACY AND

439
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
THARCHING YOU FOR LETTING US

440
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WENT

441
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
THROUGH.
NTHANK YOU.

442
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
>> THAT WAS CHRIS TEEN

443
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
WILFORD.
HER SON 7 YEAR OLD WAS SAFE.

444
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.

445
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
AND WHAT ARE DETECTIVES DOING

446
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
NOW TO PIECE TOGETHER WHY THE

447
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
SHOOTING HAPPENED?

448
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
WEELERWILL HELP ANSWER THAT.

449
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
>> IT WAS UNREAL AND I CAN'T

450
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
BELIEVE IT THAT IT IS IT TRUE.

451
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I CAN'T FATHOM THIS.

452
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
NOTHING MAKES SENSE LIKE THIS.

453
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
THIS IS IT SENSELESS.

454
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
>> STILL NO MOTIVE KNOWN AS TO

455
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
WHY THE SHOOTER DID WHAT HE

456
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
DID BEFORE TAKING HIS OWN

457
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
LIFE.

458
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
WHAT CLUES ARE PEOPLE LOOKING

459
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
FOR.

460
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
JOHN IS A POLICE DETECTIVE.

461
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
JOHN, BEFORE I GET IN THE

462
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
EVIDENCE GATHERING WHICH I

463
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
KNOW THE POLICE ARE THROUGH

464
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
NOW.

465
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE

466
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
UNDERSTAND.

467
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
WHEN THE POLICE OFFICERS FIRST

468
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
AROUND ON THE SCREEN LIKE THEY

469
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
DID IN SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY.

470
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY MAY

471
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
FACE.
THEY MAY FACE ONE GUN OR FIVE

472
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
GUNS OR EXPLOSIVES.

473
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
THEY RUN IN UATION WHERE THEY

474
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
MAY HAVE TO MAKE A SPLIT

475
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
SECOND DECISION WHERE THEY MAY

476
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
ACT THE LIVES OF KIDS.

477
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
>> IT IS TRUE.

478
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
YOU NIVER CAN FULLY PREPARE

479
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT

480
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
THE SCENARIO IS.

481
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
WE HAVE EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS

482
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
FOR THESE SHOOTERS.

483
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
AND THIS IS WHAT THE SITUATION

484
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
WAS.

485
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
AND WE HAVE POLICE OFFICERS

486
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
AND DETECTIVES AND UNITS THAT

487
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
TRAIN FOR THIS ALL OF THE TIME

488
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
FOR THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO.

489
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
AND SO WHEN THEY TURN OUT.

490
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
THEY ESTABLISH A PERIMETER AND

491
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
SET UP A MOBILE COMMAND BASE

492
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
AND PLOY THE TROOPS AND VET

493
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
INFORMATION AS IT COMES IN.

494
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
AND THEY WILL USUALLY WORK IN

495
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
A MINIMUM OF FOUR TEEMS THAT

496
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
GO THROUGH THE DOOR AND DO A

497
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
GRID SEARCH.

498
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
AND MAYBE THEY WILL ACCESS TO

499
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
POIGNS OF THE BUILDING AND

500
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
BEING AWARE OF THE CROSS FIRE

501
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
SCENARIO TO STAY AWAY FROM

502
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
THAT.
THEY GO IN AND THEY DON'T KNOW

503
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
IF THE DOORS ARE BOOBY TRAPPED

504
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
OR IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE

505
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
SHOOTER.

506
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
AND THOSE PEOPLE MAY NOT HAVE

507
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
ALL OF THE INFORMATION.

508
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
AFTER COLUMBINE.

509
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
ONE OF THE CHANGES IN DEALING

510
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENTS, AS IN

511
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
COLUMBINE THEY WAITED A MINUTE

512
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
TO ASSESS WHAT WAS GOING O.

513
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
AND THE PROTOCALL IS YOU GO IN

514
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
AND TRY TO GET TO THE SHOOTER

515
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

516
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
AND THAT MEEPS THE FIRST GUYS

517
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
IN THERE ARE PUTTING THEIR IN

518
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
HARM'S WAYS.

519
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
A CRIME LIKE THIS IS USUAL LIE

520
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
DONE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES.

521
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO ASSESS.

522
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
YOU ASSESS ON THE RUN SO YEAH,

523
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IS ON THE

524
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
OTHER SIDE.

525
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
YOU WORK OUT A PLAN BEFORE

526
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
HAND AND YOU ARE ANALYZING

527
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
YOUR STRAT STRAT ON --

528
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
STRATEGY ON THE RUN.

529
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
24 HOURS PASSED BEFORE THE

530
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
BODIES WERE REMOVED AND A LOT

531
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
OF INTENSE FORENSIC WORK WAS

532
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
GOING ON.
HELP US TO UNDERSTAND, WHAT IS

533
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
IT THAT THE POLICE ARE DOING

534
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
BEHIND THE CLOSED DOORS,

535
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
OBVIOUSLY NO CAMERAS ARE GOING

536
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
IN THERE AND NO ONE WILL GET

537
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
IN THERE IS IT EVAPORATE THAT

538
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
YOU TABE YOUR CRIME SCENE.

539
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
IT WAS A CONTAINED CRIME 69

540
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
AND BEHIND THE SCENES, THEY

541
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
ARE LOOKING AT THE PROCESS IN

542
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
THE CRIME SCENE AND FOREPSICS

543
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
THAT THEY ARE RECOVERING.

544
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
MATCHING THOSE ROUNDS TO THE

545
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
GUN.

546
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IF

547
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
YOU ARE FINDING A ROUND.

548
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
AND NO GUN.

549
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
IS THERE A SECOND SHOOTER IN

550
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
THE BUILDING OR MAYBE -- OUT

551
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
IN THE WORLD.

552
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
THAT YOU KNOW, NOW IS STILL A

553
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
THREAT TO OTHERS.

554
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
YOU WANT TO MACH SURE THERE IS

555
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
ONE SHOOTER AND YOU HAVELET

556
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
EVIDENCE. AND MAKE SURE YOU

557
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
ESTABLISH A TIME LINE TO THAT.

558
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
OF COURSE, ONCE THE SHOOTER

559
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
KILL SAYS HIMSELF .

560
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
ALL OF THAT IS SECOND HARE TO

561
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
TABING ONE OR TWO SHOOTERSMENT

562
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
ONE FINAL QUESTION.

563
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000

00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

750
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
SEE .

751
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
WHAT ARE THOSE SIGNALS AND

752
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
SIGNS THAT WE OUGHT TO WATCH

753
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
FOR IN PEOPLE?

754
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
>> THE BEST PREDICTOR OF

755
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
VIOLENT BEHAVIOR IS THE

756
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
SYMPTOMS THAT A PERSON

757
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
DISPLAYED IN THE PAST.

758
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
AND IN A PROBLEM WITH

759
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.

760
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO PEG AND

761
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
YOU SEE PEOPLE GET WITH DRAWN.

762
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
IF YOU SEE A PERSON THAT YOU

763
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
KNOW AND LOVE AND CHANGING IN

764
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
THEIR BEHAVIOR.

765
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
AND GETTING WITH DRAWN AND

766
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
PERHAPS THEY ARE HAVING

767
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
EXTENDED PERIODS OF MOOD

768
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
DIFFICULTIES.

769
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
AND WHAT I OFTEN SEE IN FAMILY

770
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
MEMBERS AND FRIENDS OF THESE

771
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
PEOPLE, THEY WILL IGNORE THESE

772
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
THINGS OR GO BOO DENIAL ABOUT

773
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
THEM.
TYPICALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT

774
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
ACTING THE NORMAL WAY THAT

775
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
THEY BEHAVE, AND ARE TARTING

776
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
TO DISPLAY CERTAIN BEHAVIORS.

777
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
OF SUBTLE THINGINGS.

778
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
START -- WITH STRANGE BELIEFS

779
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
AND FIXATED ON THIPPINGS THAT

780
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
MAKE -- THINGS THAT MAKE THEM

781
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
ANGRY.
GETTING THEM INTO SEE SOMEONE

782
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
AND A PROFESSIONAL AND SEE IF

783
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
THIS IS IT A PASSING PHASE OR

784
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT IS A

785
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
TIP OF A ICEBERG.

786
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
A LOT OF THE ONOUS IS ON FRIND

787
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
FAMILY TO GET THEM TREATMENT.

788
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
THEY BRING POEM IN MY OFFICE

789
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
TO BE EVALUATED AND OTHER

790
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
TIMES, PEOPLE ARE IN DENIAL.

791
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
IF YOU HAVE A FRIEND OR FAMILY

792
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
NUMBER THAT NIDES TO BE

793
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
ASSESSED WE NEED TO GET THEM

794
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
IN THERE AND ACCEPT THE

795
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
DIAGNOSIS.
>> FAMILY MEMBERS ARE FEARFUL

796
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000

797
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000

798
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000

WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW .

870
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
WHAT HAPPENED FRIDAY, WAS A

871
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
PICTURE OF SOMEBODY VIOLATING

872
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
THE GREATEST GIFTS THAT GOD

873
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
GAVE HUMANITY AND THAT IS FREE

874
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
WILL.

875
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
99 PERCENT OF THE TIME THEY

876
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000

878
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
CHOOSE TO RESPECT.

879
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
THEY ARE CONSES AND

880
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
OPPORTUNITIES OF FREE WILL.
AND THIS IS IT A CASE AND I

881
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
SURE MENTAL ILWAS INVOLVED AND

882
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I KNOW THE DEVIL WAS INVOLVED

883
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
AND A CASE WHERE THEY BUSED IT

884
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
IS IT AND THIS IS IT WHAT WE

885
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
HAVE TO BELIEVE.

886
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
GOD DID NOT CREATE THIS, BUT

887
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
GOD CAN USE AND TAKE THAT

888
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
WHICH WAS INTENDED FOR EVIL

889
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
AND TURN IT BOO SOMETHING

890
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000

WAS USED FOR GOOD.

894
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
GOD REDEEMED SOMETHING.

895
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE A

896
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
BUMPER STICKER THEOLOGY.

897
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO COME

898
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
BACK TO.
THE GOODNESS OF GOD AND HIS

899
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
OPPORTUNITY TO TURN EVIL TO

900
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
GOOD.

901
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
IS THAT IS IT AN IMPORTANT

902
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
POINT.

903
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
POEM ARE NOT SAYING IT IS IT A

904
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
GOOD THING.
I HEARD PEOPLE TRY TO CREATE

905
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
SELF INFLICTED JOY AND SAID

906
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
EVERYTHING IS GOD-- GOOD.

907
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
ALL THIPPINGINGS WORK TOGETHER

908
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
FOR GOOD .

909
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
BUT THIS IS IT NOT GOOD.

910
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
>> GOVERNOR, THIS STINKS .

911
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
THIS IS IT TERRIBLE.

912
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
THIS IS IT LIFE AT THE WORST

913
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
AND HUMANITY IN THE UGLIEST

914
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
AND THE UNDER BELLY OF THE

915
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
HUMAN SOUL AND THIS IS BAD.

916
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
WE NEED TO HATE IT WE NEED TO

917
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
HATE THAT WHICH IS EVIL.

918
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
WE NEED TO PRAY AGAINST IT AND

919
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
WORK AGAINST IT AND RAGE

920
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
AGAINST IT.

921
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

922
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY GOD IS

923
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
STILL GOOD.

924
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I THINK TWO OR THREE THIPPINGS

925
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER.

926
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
WE NEED TO PRAY OUR PAIN OUT.

927
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
IT IS NOT A TIME TO TURN AWAY.

928
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
BUT TURN TO GOOD.

929
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
