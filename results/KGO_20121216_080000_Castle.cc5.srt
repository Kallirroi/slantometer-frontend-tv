NIKKI HEAT?
THE CHARACTER
HE'S BASING ON YOU.

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
AND THANKS TO MY FRIENDSHIP
WITH THE MAYOR,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I GET TO BE ON HER CASE.
I WOULD BE HAPPY
TO LET YOU SPANK ME.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
AND TOGETHER...
WE SOLVE CRIMES.
WE MAKE A PRETTY GOOD TEAM,
YOU KNOW?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
LIKE STARSKY AND HUTCH,
TURNER AND HOOCH.
YOU DO REMIND ME
A LITTLE OF HOOCH.

WORLD-FAMOUS MYSTERY NOVELIST
RICHARD CASTLE?

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
HE'S RICH, HE'S HANDSOME

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
AND HE'S BASING
HIS NEXT BEST SELLER ON YOU.

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
TELL ME, DETECTIVE BECKETT,

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
WHAT'S IT LIKE
BEING THE INSPIRATION FOR

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
THRILL MASTER RICHARD CASTLE'S
NEW CHARACTER NIKKI HEAT?

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
ON BEHALF OF THE NYPD,
IT HAS BEEN A PLEASURE

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
TO OFFER MR. CASTLE
INSIGHT INTO THE PROFESSION.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
GIVEN ALL HIS BEST SELLERS,
IT'S OBVIOUS MR. CASTLE

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
HAS TREMENDOUS INSIGHT
INTO THE CRIMINAL MIND.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'M TOLD IN MANY OCCASIONS,
HIS PARTICIPATION

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
WAS ESSENTIAL TO SOLVING
YOUR TOUGHEST CASES.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
REALLY?

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
YOU WERE TOLD THAT?
BY WHO?

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
BY CASTLE.
(man) TRY UNBUTTONING HIS SHIRT.
JUST--JUST THE FIRST ONE.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
RIGHT THERE. YEAH.
COULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT?

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
(man) LOVE IT. I LOVE IT.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
SIR, COULD I TALK TO YOU
IN PRIVATE

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
BECKETT, I HAVE A COUPLE--
NOW.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
WE HAD A DEAL, BECKETT.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
THE DEAL IS OFF.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
NOT ONLY DOES HE HAVE

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
THE BACHELOR-PARTY COP TWINS
OUT THERE

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
USING HIM AS A STRIPPER POLE

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
WHILE I MAKE NICEY-NICE
WITH THE PRESS,

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID?
NO.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
HE SAID THAT HE HAS BEEN
INSTRUMENTAL

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
IN HELPING US SOLVE CRIMES.
WELL, HASN'T HE?

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
FOR NYPD TO GET GOOD PRESS?

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I MEAN, IN A MAGAZINE
THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY READ.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
THIS ARTICLE IS
VERY IMPORTANT TO THE MAYOR.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
THEREFORE, WE ARE
GOING TO COOPERATE.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
OKAY. FINE.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
IT WAS NICE
TO MEET YOU.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
WE SHOULD HAVE
PHOTO SHOOTS HERE MORE OFTEN.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
HEY, BECKETT, HOW COME YOU
DON'T WEAR A UNIFORM LIKE THAT?

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO GET PAID IN SINGLES.

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
HEY.

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
OH, HEY. UH,
DON'T WE HAVE THAT THING?

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
NO.

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THAT THING WITH THE GUY?

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
OH, YEAH.
THE THING WITH THE GUY.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
YEAH, EXCUSE US.

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW,
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I MEAN, IT WAS THE MAGAZINE.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
AND--AND, WELL, THE MAYOR
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD PRESS.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
EXPLAIN YOURSELF?

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
REALLY. SEE?
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE
AN INTERVIEW TO GET BACK TO.

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
WHAT DID I DO
THAT WAS SO WRONG?

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
THE ONE THING
I ASKED YOU NOT TO DO.
OKAY.

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
SO YOU ASKED ME NOT TO
LOOK INTO YOUR MOTHER'S MURDER,

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
BUT LOOK AT WHAT I FOUND.
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU FOUND.

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I PUT THAT ALL BEHIND ME
A LONG TIME AGO.

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
WE CAN GET BACK
TO THE INTERVIEW NOW.
NO, GONNA HAVE TO RESCHEDULE.
WE JUST CAUGHT A BODY.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
SO SORRY TO STEP OUT
ON YOU, AMY.
OOH, ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'S PERFECT.

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
A CHANCE TO SEE CASTLE
IN ACTION.

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
OUR READERS WILL LOVE IT.
WELL, WE WOULDN'T WANT TO
DISAPPOINT YOUR READERS,

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
NOW WOULD WE, DETECTIVE?

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
(siren wailing)

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
(police radio chatter)

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
HEY. CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THIS, PLEASE?

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
WELL, JUST AT LEAST
LET ME KNOW

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
WHAT I CAN DO
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
YOU COULD LEAVE ME ALONE.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
YES. WELL, I TRIED THAT,
AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
HEY, I COULD BUY YOU
A PONY.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
FOCUS, CASTLE.
CRIME SCENE, OKAY?

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
IT'S RAINING MEN.

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
CASTLE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE STILL MAD AT HIM.
GUY IN A TREE,
MOM AND DAD BICKERING--

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES.
MM-HMM.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
HOW'S IT GOING UP THERE?

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I GOT TREE BRANCHES
POKING MY BOOBS

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
AND SPOTLIGHTS
SHINING UP MY BOOTY.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
COULD BE WORSE.
YOU COULD BE WEARING A SKIRT.

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
WHEN I COME DOWN,
I'M-A SMACK YOU.

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD
TO THAT.
HERE.

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
VIC'S A WHITE MALE,
LATE 30s.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
JUDGING FROM
THE CRACKED BRANCHES,

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'M GUESSING HE DID A SUPERMAN
OFF THE TOP OF THAT BUILDING.

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
(Esposito) VIC'S NAME
IS JOHN ALLEN.

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I.D. HAS HIM
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
BUSINESS CARD HAS HIM
IN INSURANCE.
MM.

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
IS IT A SU

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
IS IT A SUICIDE?
(Castle and Beckett)
IT'S NOT A SUICIDE.

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
UM, THE BUILDING
IS TOO SHORT.

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
HE'D WANT TO KILL HIMSELF,
NOT CRIPPLE HIMSELF.
WELL, IF YOU WANT TO DIE,
YOU'RE GONNA AIM FOR CONCRETE,

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
NOT A TREE.

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
JUDGING FROM
THE ANGLE OF DESCENT,

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'D SAY THAT GUY WAS THROWN
OFF THE BUILDING.

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
SINCE IT CLEARLY WASN'T
A SUICIDE, HOW DID HE DIE?

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
THERE ARE SIGNS
OF STRANGULATION.

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
IT LOOKS LIKE
HIS WINDPIPE WAS CRUSHED.
ANY LIGATURE MARKS?

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
NOPE.
"LIGATURE" REFERS TO
ANYTHING THAT TIES OR BINDS,

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
LIKE A ROPE OR A BELT.

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
LACK OF ANY MARKS SUGGESTS
HE WAS STRANGLED BY HAND.
WOW. YOU REALL NO W

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
NO WONDER THEY LIKE
HAVING YOU AROUND.

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
YOU KNOW WHAT? HE'S SUCH
AN INCREDIBLE RESOURCE,

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
IT SEEMS LIKE A SHAME TO WASTE
HIS TALENTS HERE IN THE FIELD.

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
WOULD YOU MIND GOING BACK
TO THE MORGUE WITH DR. PARISH

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
TO SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN
FIND OUT ABOUT THE VIC?
DON'T YOU THINK

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'D BE OF MORE USE
HERE AT THE CRIME SCENE?
OH, NO. WE'RE JUST GONNA
KNOCK ON DOORS

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
AND SEE WHAT ELSE
WE CAN STIR UP.

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
YOU KNOW,
BORING POLICE STUFF.

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
FINE. BUT I WAS SERIOUS
ABOUT THE PONY.

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU
THE, UH, MORGUE... MOBILE.

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
ANYTHING IN THE WALLET?

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
NOPE. DRY CLEANING TICKET,
I.D., TWO CREDIT CARDS.

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
CASH WAS MISSING, THOUGH.

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
THAT'S A LONG WAY TO GO
FOR A ROBBERY.

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
(siren whoops)

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
(police radio chatter)

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
YOU MEAN WE HAVE TO RIDE
WITH THE BODY?

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
YOU CAN TAKE MY SEAT
UP FRONT.

133
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
YOU SURE?

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
MM-HMM. I'M USED
TO HANGING OUT WITH STIFFS.

135
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
(chuckles)

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
(police radio chatter)

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
HI.

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
UNH-UNH. YOU DO NOT
GET TO SAY HI TO ME.

139
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'M JUST DOING MY GIRL
A FAVOR.

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
OH, YOU, TOO, HUH?

141
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
WELL, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
BECKETT SPENT THE FIRST
THREE YEARS OF BEING A COP

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
TRYING TO SOLVE
HER MOTHER'S MURDER.

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
IT TOOK EVERYTHING THAT SHE HAD
TO PUT IT BEHIND HER.

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
YOU COULDN'T RESPECT THAT?
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO,
NOT TELL HER WHAT I'D FOUND?

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
WHAT YOU FOUND?
OH, SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU,
DID SHE?

147
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED
THE SAME WAY HER MOTHER WAS

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
RIGHT ABOUT THE SAME TIME.

149
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
ONE OF 'EM WAS
A FORMER LAW STUDENT OF HERS.

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
ANOTHER ONE,
A DOCUMENTS CLERK.

151
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
THE THIRD ONE,
A LAWYER FOR A NONPROFIT.

152
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
WAIT, THE M.E. AT THE TIME
DIDN'T MAKE THE CONNECTION?

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
IF HE DID,
HE BURIED IT.

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
DID YOU TALK TO HIM?

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
HE DIED FOUR YEARS AGO.

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
SO YOU SEE
WHY I HAD TO TELL HER.

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
THAT WE WERE DONE.

159
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
AND THEN SHE JUST WALKED--
(metal crunches)

160
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
(tires squeal)
(man) COME ON! GO! GO! GO!

161
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
(metal clatters)

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
DON'T MOVE. DON'T MOVE.

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
WHOA!

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
(man) GET THE BODY!

DON'T MOVE!

COME ON!

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
IS IT JUST ME, OR WAS THAT
REALLY, REALLY WEIRD?

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
A deep, throbbing,
persistent ache.

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
My doctor diagnosed it
as fibromyalgia,

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
thought to be the
result of overactive nerves

177
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
that cause chronic
widespread pain.

178
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Lyrica is believed
to calm these nerves.

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I learned Lyrica can provide
significant relief

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
from fibromyalgia pain.

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And for some people,
it can work in as early as

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
the first week of treatment.

183
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So now I can do more of
the things that I enjoy.

184
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Lyrica is not for everyone.

185
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Lyrica may cause serious
allergic reactions

186
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
or suicidal thoughts or actions.

187
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Tell your doctor right away
if you have these,

188
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
new or worsening depression,

189
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
or unusual changes in mood
or behavior,

190
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
or any swelling on,

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
or changes in eyesight,
including blurry vision

192
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
or muscle pain with fever
or tired feeling.

193
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Common side effects
are dizziness, sleepiness,

194
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
weight gain, and swelling of
hands, legs and feet.

195
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't drink alcohol
while taking Lyrica.

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't drive or use machinery
until you know

197
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
how Lyrica affects you.

198
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
With less pain,
I'm feeling better

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
now that I've found Lyrica.

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ask your doctor
if Lyrica is right

201
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
for your fibromyalgia pain.

202
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
YOU SPEND ALL DAY COOKING IT.

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
SO WHY SPEND EVEN A MOMENT

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
CONSIDERING ANY BROTH
BUT SWANSON?

205
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
THE BROTH COOKS TRUST MOST

206
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
TO MAKE THE MEAL FOLKS SPEND
ALL YEAR WAITING FOR.

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
IN STUFFING AND MORE,
THE SECRET IS SWANSON.

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
ELL?
HE'LL LIVE.
TO MAKE THE MEAL FOLKS SPEND
ALL YEAR WAITING FOR.

209
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
WHAT, NO BRAIN DAMAGE?
IF HE HAS SOME, IT HAPPENED
WAY BEFORE TONIGHT,

210
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
AND IT WAS PROBABLY
SELF-INFLICTED.
AHH. GOOD TIMES.

HOW'S LOIS LANE?
WHO, REPORTER CHICK?

C.S.U.s ARE COMBING THE ROOFTOP,

OR THE GUYS WHO KILLED HIM

221
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
MIGHT HAVE LEFT
SOME EVIDENCE BEHIND.
BORING.

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
HOW ABOUT A SPY

ALL RIGHT, I'LL LET YOU WORK
THIS ONE CASE WITH ME

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000

LEAVE ME ALONE WHEN IT'S OVER

234
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
AND NOT TO WEASEL YOUR WAY
BACK IN.

235
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
DEAL.

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
BUT FAIR WARNING,
DETECTIVE.

237
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I WILL MAKE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I WON'T.
YOU WILL.

239
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
(Castle) SO WHAT'S
THE NEXT STEP, VICTIM'S FAMILY?

240
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
HUH. I DIDN'T THINK
SHE'D TAKE HIM BACK.

241
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
(knock on door)

242
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
MRS. ALLEN?

243
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
YES.

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
IT'S ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.

245
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
HE WAS JUST RIGHT HERE

246
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO,
AND NOW HE'S DEAD. I...

247
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
DO YOU KNOW OF ANY REASON WHY
HE'D BE IN THAT PART OF TOWN?

248
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
NO.

249
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
HIS OFFICE IS, UH,
IN MIDTOWN.

250
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
IT'S NOWHERE NEAR NINTH.

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
WHAT TIME DID HE LEAVE
THE APARTMENT?

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
AROUND 6:00.

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
HE HAD JUST GOTTEN BACK
FROM HIS TRIP

254
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
AND, UH, HE SAID HE NEEDED
TO CATCH UP ON SOME PAPERWORK.

255
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
HE SAID HE'D ONLY BE GONE
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
YOU SAID A TRIP?

257
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
HE WAS IN ALBUQUERQUE
ON A TRAINING SEMINAR.

258
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
IT WAS JUST TWO NIGHTS.

259
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING
UNUSUAL RECENTLY,

260
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
ANY STRANGE BEHAVIOR?

261
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
WELL, HE--
HE HAD TO WORK LATE

262
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
A LITTLE MORE OFTEN
THAN USUAL.

263
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
BUT I MEAN, IN THIS ECONOMY,
WHO DOESN'T?

264
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
HE HAD TO LAY OFF
HALF HIS DEPARTMENT LAST YEAR.

265
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
AND YOU'RE SURE
HE WAS WORKING LATE?

266
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
THAT HE WAS CHEATING?

267
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
EVERY NIGHT, HE WOULD
WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR,

268
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
AND THE KIDS WOULD JUST
RACE INTO HIS ARMS, OKAY?

269
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
AND NOW HE'S GONE.

270
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
SO DON'T ASK ME IF HE WAS
REALLY WORKING LATE.

271
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
TELL ME WHY HE WAS KILLED.

272
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
HE DIDN'T MEAN TO IMPLY--

273
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
WHAT ABOUT PHONE CALLS,
MAYBE LATE AT NIGHT?
CASTLE.

274
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
YEAH. YEAH. UM...

275
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
(sniffles) ONE OF THE GUYS
THAT JOHN FIRED--

276
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
MAX HAVERSTOCK.

277
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
HE WOULD CALL HIM UP
LATE AT NIGHT,

278
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
AND HE WOULD YELL AT HIM,
ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

279
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I GUESS HE WAS HURTING,
HE NEEDED MONEY.

280
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
AND I-I TOLD JOHN THAT
HE SHOULD JUST HANG UP ON HIM.

281
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
AND JOHN SAID NO, HE--
HE COULDN'T DO THAT.

282
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
DID HE EVER GIVE HIM MONEY?

283
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
MY HUSBAND DIDN'T BELIEVE
IN HANDOUTS.

284
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
HE BELIEVED THAT A MAN
SHOULD MAKE HIS WAY.

285
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
WHERE IS HE?

286
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'D LIKE TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

287
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
ABOUT THAT. UM...

288
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
THAT WAS AWKWARD.

289
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
(scoffs) IT JUST--
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

290
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
THE GUY'S GOT A STABLE,
MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE--

291
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
GOOD JOB, GOOD FAMILY.

292
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
MAYBE HIS FRIEND MAX
WAS JEALOUS.
(keypad beeps, telephone rings)

293
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
YEAH, MAYBE ENOUGH TO KILL HIM,
BUT TO STEAL HIS BODY?

294
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
HEY, ESPOSITO. I NEED YOU
TO LOOK UP A FRIEND OF THE VIC.

295
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
MAX HAVERSTOCK.

296

(elevator bell dings)

297
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
YEAH.

298
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
OKAY, FIND HIM
AND, UH, BRING HIM IN.

299
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
(keys jangle)
DAD. THANK GOD YOU'RE HOME.
ARE YOU OKAY?

300
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
YEAH, I'M FINE. WHY?
FINE? MASKED GUNMEN,
BODY SNATCHERS?

301
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I TEXTED YOU
LIKE A THOUSAND TIMES.

302
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
OH, I'M SORRY.
MY PHONE MUST'VE BEEN OFF.

303
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
HOW--HOW DID YOU KNOW?

304
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
BECKETT CALLED.

305
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
REALLY?
SHE JUST WANTED TO LET US KNOW
YOU WERE ALL RIGHT.

306
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
MM-HMM.

307
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
SO HAS SHE FORGIVEN YOU?

308
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
UH, NOT EXACTLY, MOTHER.
BUT I'M WORKING ON IT.

309
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
SHE HAS AGREED
TO LET ME HELP ON THE CASE.

310
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
WELL, THAT'S A START,
I SUPPOSE.

311
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
IT IS MORE THAN A START.
IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY.

312
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
EEN US,BUILT A WALL
BETWEEN US,

313
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
BUT I AM GOING TO...
BUILD A DOOR IN THAT WALL,

314
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
OR PUT UP A LADDER
OR DIG A HOLE.
(keypad beeping)

315
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
YOU HAVE A STRATEGY?
BE MY USUAL, CHARMING SELF.

316
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
(beeping continues)

317
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
UH-HUH.
WHAT ABOUT PLAN "B"?

318
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
SO WAS IT AWFUL?
WERE YOU SCARED?

319
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
ME, SCARED? NO WAY.
COME ON.

320
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
NOW EXCUSE ME
WHILE I CHANGE MY SHORTS.
DAD.

321
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
NO, I WAS SCARED. BUT ALL THEY
WERE AFTER WAS THE BODY.

322
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
WHY?
WHY INDEED.

323
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
(beeping continues)
"DAD, WHERE ARE YOU?
DAD, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

324
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
"DAD, CALL US RIGHT AWAY.

325
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
DAD, CAN I GO SEE 'FAME'
WITH OWEN ON FRIDAY?"

326
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
YOUR CONCERN IS TOUCHING.
OKAY, THAT ONE WAS AFTER
I KNEW YOU WERE ALL RIGHT.

327
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
YEAH, BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE
GONNA GO SEE THAT TOGETHER.
WE WERE, AND WE STILL CAN.

328
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
BUT HE INVITED ME TO GO
SEE IT WITH HIM NEXT FRIDAY.

329
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
YOU'D RATHER GO WITH
YOUR BOYFRIEND THAN YOUR DAD?

330
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

331
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
IF YOU REALLY WANT ME
