00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
WE KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO BE

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
HORRIBLE BUT THE EXTENT OF THE

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
DETAIL WAS CLINICAL.

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
THREE-LEN GUN SHOT WOUNDS AND

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
THOSE ARE THE FOLKS HE HAD A

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
CHANCE TO EXAMINE HIMSELF.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
HE PARTICIPATED IN 7 OF THE

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
EXAMS PERSONALLY.

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
THE PAPERWORK IS COMPLETED AND

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
NOW, IT IS TIME FOR THE

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
FAMILIES TO HAVE A CHANCE TO

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
SEE THEIR LOVED ONES AND

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000

THE COMMUNITY.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
GOVERNOR.

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
>> MOLLY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

ATTEMPT TO EXPRESS OUR

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
COLLECTIVE SHOCK WHEN WE SAY

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THE HORRIFIC SHOOTING IN THE

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
SANDY HOOKS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
IT IS IT NOT SENSE TO A

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
RATIONAL HUMAN BEING.

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
THE GOVERNOR MALLOY GOT IT

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
RIGHT WHEN HE SAID ERIL

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
VISITED THE COMMUNITY.

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE MORE AS

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
A PARENT THAN A POLITICIAN AND

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
QUOTED THE BIBLE TO BRING

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
COMFORT TO THE NATION.

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
CHURCHES WERE FILLED IN

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT LAST

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
NIGHT AS CANDLELIGHT VIGILS

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
WERE HELD TO GRIEVE FOR THE 27

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
INNOCENT PEOPLE KILLED AND

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
THOSE SHATTERED BY THE CRAZED

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
CARNAGE.

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
ON FRIDAY, NEAL CAVUTED ME,

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
WHERE WAS GOD IN WE HAVE

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
SYSTEMATICALLY REMOVED GOD

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
FROM OUR SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
ACCOUNT ACTIVITIES AND AT THE

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
MOMENT OF THE CALAMITY WE

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
WONDER WHERE IT WAS.

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
THE LIBERAL WAVE HAD A VIOLENT

122
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
AND JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION

123
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
THAT IF I SAID PRAYER WAS IN

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
SCHOOL THE SHOOTING WOULD NOT

125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
HAVE HAPPEN.

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I SAID NOTHING OF THE SORT.

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
IT IS FAR MORE THAN PRAYER AND

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
BIBLE READING.

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
IT IS IT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
SUE A CITY SO WE HAVE NO MAJOR

131
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
16 OR CHRISTMAS CAROL CHURCHES

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
AND CHRISTIAN OWNED BUSINESSES

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
ARE TOLD TO SURRENDER THE

134
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
VALUES UNDER THE EDICT OF THE

135
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
GOVERNMENT ORDERS TO PROVIDE

136
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
TAX-FUNDED ABORTION PILLS .

137
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
WE SAY THINGS ARE SINFUL AND

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
SAY THEY ARE DISORDERS AND

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
SOMETIMES WE SAY THEY ARE

140
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
NORMAL AND HAVE TO ABANDON BED

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
ROCK MEMIORAL TRUTHS, WE WERE,

142
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
WHERE WAS GOD?

143
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
WHY ESCORTED HIM OUT OF OUR

144
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
CULTURE AND MARCHED HIM OUT OF

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THE PUBLIC SQUARE AND THEN

146
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
SURPRISED THAT A CULTURE

147
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
REFLECTS WHAT IT IS IT BECOME.

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
AS SOON AS THE TRAGEDY

149
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
UNFOLDED HE SHOWED UP.

150
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
IN THE LIVES OF TEACHERS WHO

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
PUT THEIR LIVES BETWEEN THE

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
GUNMEN AND THE STUDENTS AND IN

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
POLICEMEN WHO RUSH SCHOOL NOT

154
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
KNOWING IF THEY WOULD BE MET

155
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
WITH A BARAGE OF STUDENTS.

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
AND HUGS AND TIERCE OF PARENTS

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
AND TEACHERS THAT LIVED

158
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
THROUGH THE SLAUGHTER AND

159
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
OVERFLOWED CHURCH SERVICES

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
WHERE PEOPLE LIT CANDLES AND

161
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
PRAYED HE SHOWED UP IN THE

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
WHITE HOUSE WHERE THE

163
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
PRESIDENT ENVOKED HIS NAME AND

164
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
QUOTED FROM HIS BOOK THEN IN A

165
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
FEW DAYS, WE'LL GOD TO EXCUSE

166
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
HIMSELF.
AND ANNOUNCE IN OUR ARROGANT

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
PRIDE THAT WE HAVE EVOLVED

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
BEYOND NEEDING HIM AND SOMEONE

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
WILL SUGGEST WE HAVE A LAW TO

170
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
STOP THIS.

171
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
WE DON'T HAVE TO PASS A NEW

172
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
ONE.

173
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
THERE IS ONE THAT WORKS IF WE

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
TEACH AND OBSERVE IT.

175
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
SHAW SHALT NOT KILL.

176
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THERE ARE NINE OTHERS.

177
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
BUT TO TELL THEM ABOUT THAT

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
WOULD REQUIRE BRINGING GOD

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
BACK AND WE KNOW HOW

180
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
UNACCEPTABLE THAT MIGHT BE.

181
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
GERALDO RIVARY IS STANDING BY

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
IN NEWTOWN, BUT MORE

183
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
IMPORTANTLY GERALDO, I CAN'T

184
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
THINK OF ANY MAJOR AMERICAN

185
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
TRANNEL DEE THAT YOU HAVE NOT

186
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
SEEN UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL IN

187
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
THE LAST 40 YEARS.

188
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
HOW DOES THIS ONE COMPARE TO

189
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
THE TRAGIC EVENTS THAT YOU

190
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
APPROPRIATE CIVILIZED CONDUCT.

217
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000

ATTENTION TO THE PLIGHT AND

248
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
THEN THERE COMES A TIME WHEN

249
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
THEY WANT PEOPLE TO LEAVE AND

250
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
THEY NEED PEACE.

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
ARE THEY THEY AT THAT POINT OR

252
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000

WILEHEAR FROM A MOTHER WHOSE

307
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
SON WAS AT SANDY HOOK AND HE

308
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Mmmm tasty.

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And cut! Very good.

314
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
People are always asking me how
we make these GEICO adverts.

315
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So we're taking you
behind the scenes.

316
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This coffee cup, for example,
is computer animated.

317
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's not real.

318
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
GEICO's customer satisfaction
is quite real though.

319
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
This computer-animated
coffee tastes dreadful.

320
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
GEICO. 15 minutes could
save you 15 % or more
on car insurance.

AND A QUESTION WE WREST WILL

948
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
WITH IF THERE IS IT A PICTURE

949
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
OF UNBRIDALED HORROR THIS IS

950
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW .

951
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
WHAT HAPPENED FRIDAY, WAS A

952
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
PICTURE OF SOMEBODY VIOLATING

953
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
THE GREATEST GIFTS THAT GOD

954
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
GAVE HUMANITY AND THAT IS FREE

955
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
WILL.
99 PERCENT OF THE TIME THEY

956
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
USE FREE WILL TO DO GOOD

957
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
THINGS AND CHOOSE TO LOVE AND

958
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
CHOOSE TO RESPECT.

959
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
THEY ARE CONSES AND

960
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
OPPORTUNITIES OF FREE WILL.

961
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
AND THIS IS IT A CASE AND I

962
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
SURE MENTAL ILWAS INVOLVED AND

963
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I KNOW THE DEVIL WAS INVOLVED

964
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
AND A CASE WHERE THEY BUSED IT

965
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
IS IT AND THIS IS IT WHAT WE

966
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
HAVE TO BELIEVE.

967
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
GOD DID NOT CREATE THIS, BUT

968
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
GOD CAN USE AND TAKE THAT

969
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
WHICH WAS INTENDED FOR EVIL

970
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
AND TURN IT BOO SOMETHING

971
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
GOOD.

972
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
LIKE DARRYL ON YOUR BROADCAST

973
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
SHOWED US.

974
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
THE TERRIBLE DEATH FOR RACHEL

975
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
WAS USED FOR GOOD.

976
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
GOD REDEEMED SOMETHING.

977
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE A

978
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
BUMPER STICKER THEOLOGY.

979
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO COME

980
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
BACK TO.

981
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
THE GOODNESS OF GOD AND HIS

982
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
OPPORTUNITY TO TURN EVIL TO

983
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
GOOD.
IS THAT IS IT AN IMPORTANT

984
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
POINT.
POEM ARE NOT SAYING IT IS IT A

985
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
GOOD THING.

986
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I HEARD PEOPLE TRY TO CREATE

987
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
SELF INFLICTED JOY AND SAID

988
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
EVERYTHING IS GOD-- GOOD.

989
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
ALL THIPPINGINGS WORK TOGETHER

990
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
FOR GOOD .
BUT THIS IS IT NOT GOOD.

991
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
>> GOVERNOR, THIS STINKS .

992
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
THIS IS IT TERRIBLE.

993
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
THIS IS IT LIFE AT THE WORST

994
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
AND HUMANITY IN THE UGLIEST

995
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
AND THE UNDER BELLY OF THE

996
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
HUMAN SOUL AND THIS IS BAD.

997
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
WE NEED TO HATE IT WE NEED TO

998
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
HATE THAT WHICH IS EVIL.

999
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
WE NEED TO PRAY AGAINST IT AND

1000
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
WORK AGAINST IT AND RAGE

1001
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
AGAINST IT.

1002
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

1003
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY GOD IS

1004
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
STILL GOOD.

1005
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I THINK TWO OR THREE THIPPINGS

1006
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER.

1007
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
WE NEED TO PRAY OUR PAIN OUT.

1008
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
IT IS NOT A TIME TO TURN AWAY.

1009
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
BUT TURN TO GOOD.

1010
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
FIPED THE COMMUPT TO HELP EACH

1011
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000

HE IS STRONG AND CAPABLE X.

1016
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
FOCUS ON HEAVEN.

1017
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
THERE IS NOTHING IN THE

1018

00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
ABSEPS OF PAIN.

1020
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
HIS LIFE WAS UNDERSTANDED ON A

1021
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
CROSS.

1022
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
AND GOD TOOK A SLAUGHTER OF

1023
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000

THERE IS NOTHING GOOD BUT HE

1027
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
WILL TURN IT IN TO SOMETHING

1028
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000

I WOULD SAY THIS IS IT BAD .

1040
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
THIS IS IT BAD.
WE LIVE IN A WORLD THERE IS

1041
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000

THE WORLD.

1047
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
THERE IS A DEVIL AND A FORCE

1048
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
OF EVIL.
AND HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN.

1049
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
HIS TIME IS LIMITED AND HE'S

1050
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
ON A SHORT LEASE.

1051
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
OUR KIDS SEE EVIL EVERY DAY

1052
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,000
