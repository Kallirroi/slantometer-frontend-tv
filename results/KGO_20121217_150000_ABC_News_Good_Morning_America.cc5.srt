HOOK, SUCH PRIDE BECAUSE HER DAD

189
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
WENT THERE, TOO.

190
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
>> NOW, I SAT DOWN WITH
JESSICA'S PARENTS YESTERDAY.

191
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'LL HAVE MORE OF THE INTERVIEW

192
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
COMING UP.

193
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS

194
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
INTERVIEW IS SO POWERFUL.
IT LEFT SUCH AN IMPRESSION ON ME

195
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
AND THE ENTIRE CREW.

196
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
THERE WAS NOT A DRY EYE.

197
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL NEVER
FORGET.

198
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
>> NOW TO ELIZABETH IN NEW YORK.

199
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000

THE GUNMAN.
WE'RE PIECING TOGETHER A PICTURE

202
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
OF ADAM LANZA.

203
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
BUT STILL LEFT WITH THE QUESTION

204
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
OF WHY HE WOULD COMMIT THIS

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
HORRIFIC ACT?

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
WHY WOULD HE TARGET SUCH SMALL

207
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
CHILDREN?
ABC'S CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
REPORTER BRIAN ROSS HAS BEEN

209
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
TRACKING THAT PART OF THE STORY

210
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000

HAPPENED.

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
BUT EVEN VETERAN DETECTIVES AND

218
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
AGENTS ARE HAVING A HARD TIME AT

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
THE SCENE.

220
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
HE HAD A HUGE QUANTITY OF

221
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000

237
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
WENT ON, AS HE WAS GETTING
THROUGH SCHOOL.

250
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
EYES FOR MORE THAN A FEW

251
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
SECONDS.

PHYSICAL PAIN.

>> IF HE CUT HIMSELF OR HURT

259
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000

>> HE HAD PERIODS OF TIME WHERE

264
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
HE WOULD WITHDRAW ENTIRELY.

265
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
YOU WOULD HAVE TO WORK HARD TO

266
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
REACH HIM AGAIN.

PAIN.

277
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
MAKES YOU WONDER IF THAT MEANS

278
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
HE DIDN'T FEEL EMOTIONAL PAIN AS

279
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000

UNIMAGINABLE COURAGE THAT WENT

ON INSIDE THE SCHOOL ON FRIDAY.
ALL IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT

SCHOOL.

302
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
IS THERE ANY WAY TO KNOW HOW

303
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
MANY LIVES SHE SAVED?

304
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW

305
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000

NOW ALYSSA HAS THE PAINFUL TASK
OF BURYING A FRIEND.

331
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
AND WOULD BE THE FIRST PERSON TO
GET IN SOMEONE'S FACE.

332

>> Reporter: YOU THINK SHE GOT

333

IF SHE WAS -- SHE WAS A MOTHER

335
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
TIGER DEFENDING HER CUBS, I
WOULD PICTURE HER ACTING LIKE

336
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
THAT.

337
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
YEAH.

>> Reporter: NO STORY PERHAPS IS

339
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
MORE POIGNANT THAN THE LITTLE

340
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
6-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO WAS THE ONLY

341
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
SURVIVOR IN HER CLASS OF 15

342
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000

WAS ABLE TO ACT AS IF SHE WAS

349
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
ALREADY DECEASED.

350
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
SO THAT THE GUNMAN WOULDN'T

351
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
TARGET HER.

352
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
SO SHE LAID THERE PRETENDING SHE

353
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
WAS DEAD.

354
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000

TAKE US BACK TO THAT MOMENT.

362
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
WHEN DID YOU FIRST KNOW

363
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG?

364
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
>> HEARING A LOUD POPPING NOISE.

365
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I MEAN, JUST -- SOMETHING I HAVE
NEVER HEARD IN MY LIFE.

366
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
AND YOUR MIND DOESN'T THINK THAT

367
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
IT COULD BE THAT.

368
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
BUT WHEN THE SECRETARY CALLED

369
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
OUT TO ME, WITH TERROR IN HER

370
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
VOICE, IT JUST TOLD ME THERE WAS

371
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000

383
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
OFFICE.
AND WHEN I HEARD THE DOOR CLOSE,

385
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
YOU KNOW -- AND HE PROBABLY

386
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
WALKED IN, AND I WAS LOOKING AND

387
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000

392
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000

PULLED THE DOOR CLOSED AND RACED

DIALED 911.

415
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000

and accomplish more.

1100
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Lyrica is not for everyone.

1101
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Lyrica may cause serious
allergic reactions

1102
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
or suicidal thoughts or actions.

1103
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Tell your doctor right away
if you have these,

1104
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
new or worsening depression,

1105
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
or unusual changes in mood
or behavior,

1106
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
or any swelling or
affected breathing or skin,

1107
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
or changes in eyesight,
including blurry vision

1108
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
or muscle pain with fever
or tired feeling.

1109
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Common side effects
are dizziness, sleepiness,

1110
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
weight gain, and swelling of
hands, legs and feet.

1111
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Don't drink alcohol
while taking Lyrica.

1112
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Don't drive or use machinery
until you know

1113
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
how Lyrica affects you.

1114
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
With less pain,
I'm feeling better

1115
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
now that I've found Lyrica.

1116
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Ask your doctor
if Lyrica is right

1117
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
for your fibromyalgia pain.

BOB HAS AFIB:

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION NOT CAUSED
BY A HEART VALVE PROBLEM,

1389

[ Male Announcer ]
FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN,

1393
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
AND MADE A MONTHLY TRIP TO THE
CLINIC TO GET HIS BLOOD TESTED.

1394
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

1395
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
BOB'S DOCTOR RECOMMENDED
A DIFFERENT OPTION:

1396
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
ONCE-A-DAY XARELTO®.

1397
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
XARELTO® IS THE FIRST AND ONLY

1398
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
ONCE-A-DAY PRESCRIPTION
BLOOD THINNER

1399
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
FOR PATIENTS WITH AFIB

1400
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
NOT CAUSED
BY A HEART VALVE PROBLEM,

1401
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE
ROUTINE BLOOD MONITORING.

1402
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
LIKE WARFARIN,
XARELTO® IS PROVEN EFFECTIVE

1403
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
TO REDUCE THE RISK
OF AN AFIB-RELATED STROKE.

1404
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
THERE IS LIMITED DATA
ON HOW THESE DRUGS COMPARE

1405
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
WHEN WARFARIN IS WELL MANAGED.

01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
NO ROUTINE BLOOD MONITORING

1407
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000

DO NOT STOP TAKING
XARELTO® RIVAROXABAN

1414
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
WITHOUT TALKING TO THE DOCTOR
WHO PRESCRIBES IT FOR YOU.

1415
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
STOPPING MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK
OF HAVING A STROKE.

1416
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY

1417
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
IF YOU DEVELOP ANY SIGNS
OR SYMPTOMS OF BLEEDING,

1418
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING
OR TINGLING.

1419
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
YOU MAY HAVE A HIGHER RISK
OF BLEEDING

1420
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
IF YOU TAKE XARELTO®
WITH ASPIRIN PRODUCTS,

1421
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
NSAIDS OR BLOOD THINNERS.

1422
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
BEFORE TAKING XARELTO®

1423
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE
ABNORMAL BLEEDING.

1424
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
XARELTO® CAN CAUSE BLEEDING,
WHICH CAN BE SERIOUS,

1425
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
AND RARELY MAY LEAD TO DEATH.

1426
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
YOU ARE LIKELY TO BRUISE
MORE EASILY ON XARELTO®,

1427
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
AND IT MAY TAKE LONGER
FOR BLEEDING TO STOP.

1428
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
TELL YOUR DOCTORS
YOU ARE TAKING XARELTO®

1429
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
BEFORE ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
OR DENTAL PROCEDURES.

1430
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
BEFORE STARTING XARELTO®,
TELL YOUR DOCTOR

1431
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
ABOUT ANY CONDITIONS,
SUCH AS KIDNEY, LIVER

1432
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
OR BLEEDING PROBLEMS.

KIDS MAY HAVE HEARD SOMETHING

1729
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:31,000
AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHICH

1730
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
KIDS WE NEED TO TALK TO.

1731

TO MANAGE THE COMPLICATED AND

1738
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
POWERFUL EMOTIONS WE HAVE OFF

1739
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
CAMERA, IF YOU WILL.

1740
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
TALK WITH OTHER ADULTS, WORK

1741
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
WITH THEM ON OUR OWN, SHARE THEM

POWERFUL FEELINGS.

1747
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
THEN TO REASSURE CHILDREN, ALSO

1748
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
IN VERY SPECIFIC AND CONCRETE

1749
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
WAYS THAT THEIR SCHOOL IS SAFE.

1750
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
GIVE THEM ACTUAL EXAMPLES,

1751
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
BECAUSE LITTLE KIDS THINK VERY

1752
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
CONCRETELY.

1753
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
HERE ARE THE WAYS THAT ADULTS

1754
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
ARE WORKING TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

1755
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000

MOM AND DAD.

1757
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
HERE ARE SOME OF THE DRILLS THAT

1758
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
YOU PRACTICE AT SCHOOL TO KEEP

1759
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
YOU SAFE.

1760
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
AGAIN, THOSE SPECIFICS GIVE THEM

1761
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:34,000
COMFORT.
>> WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE OLDER

1762
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000

YOU'RE GIVING THEM ENOUGH AND

1774
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:06,000
YOU ENCOURAGE THEM TO GIVE YOU

1775
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,000
SIGNS TO GIVE THEM MORE DETAILS.

1776
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
SIMPLE, FACTUAL, DIRECT.

TEEMPS NEED TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT

1781

FOR SIGNS OF ANXIETY IN THE

CLASSROOM BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES,

1783
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
CHILDREN DON'T RAISE THEIR HANDS

1784
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
AND SAY, I'M UPSET.

1785
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
BUT THEY'LL ACT IT OUT.

1786

>> HERE, WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT

1787
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
ISSUE.

1788
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
SOME YOUNG PEOPLE ARE VERY THEIR

1789
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
OWN TRAUMA IN THEIR LIFE THAT

1790
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
THIS ADDED ADDITIONAL TRAUMA IS

1791
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
GOING TO REALLY TIP THEM REALLY

1792
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
OVER AN EMOTIONAL EDGE.

1793
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

1794
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
SUPPORT FOR THOSE KIDS.

1795
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
TEEM

1796

TEACHERS NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO

1797
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
TRIAGE.
SOME KIDS NEED AN ARM AROUND

1798
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
THEM AND SAY, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1799
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
TIL TELL YOU THIS.

1800
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
ALL OVER AMERICA, TEACHERS

1801
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
SHOULD BE EXPLAINING TO CHILDREN

1802
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO LISTEN BE

1803
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
CALM, AND DO WHAT THEY'RE TOLD

1804
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
WHEN AN EMERGENCY HAPPENS.

1805
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
IT WILL MAKE KIDS FEEL BETTER

1806
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
KNOWING THERE'S A PLAN.
>> AND YOU SAID ALSO, TEACHERS

1807
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
MAY BE FEELING TRAUMA.

1808
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
THERE WERE TEACHERS SLAIN IN

1809
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
THIS AS WELL.

1810

ON THAT SINGLE DAY, THE FBI DID

1991
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
COMPUTERIZED BACKGROUND CHECKS

1992
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:54,000
ON MORE THAN 154,000 PURCHASES

1993
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
OF FIREARMS.

1994
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
IN NOVEMBER ALONE, AMERICANS
TRIED TO BUY A WHOPPING 2

1995
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
MILLION GUNS.

1996
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
HERE ARE SOME FACTS THAT MIGHT

1997
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
SURPRISE YOU.

1998
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
THERE ARE MORE REGISTERED GUN
DEALERS AND STORES THAN MAJOR

1999
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
SUPERMARKETS.

2000
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
MORE GUN SELLERS THAN McDONALD'S
RESTAURANTS.

2001
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF GUN

2002
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
USERS ARE LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS.

2003
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:20,000
THE MILLIONS OF GUNS ALREADY IN

2004
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
CIRCULATION GUARANTEE THAT

2005
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
DISTURBED PEOPLE WILL OFTEN BE

2006
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
ABLE TO OBTAIN THEM, EVEN IN

2007
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:32,000
QUIET COMMUNITIES LIKE NEWTOWN.

2008
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
WE SPOKE TO THE FBI ON-SCENE

2009
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
COMMANDER.
>> THERE ARE ABOUT 400 GUN

2010
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
DEALERS IN A FOUR-COUNTY AREA.

2011
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
WITHIN TEN MILES OF THE

2012
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
INCIDENT, 36 GUN DEALERS.

2013
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
>> Reporter: POLICE BELIEVE THE

2014
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
GUNS ADAM LANZA USED WERE BOUGHT

2015
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
LEGALLY.

2016
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,000
>> IN AMERICA, UNLESS YOU HAVE A
FELONY CONVICTION OR YOU'RE

2017
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:53,000
A JUDE KATED BY THE COURT TO BE

2018
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
MENTALLY INCOMPETENT, YOU HAVE

2019
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
THE RIGHT TO BEAR FIREARMS.

2020
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
>> Reporter: THIS MORNING,

2021
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
AMERICA IS LEFT WITH A QUESTION.

2022
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
HOW DO YOU KEEP WEAPONS FROM MEN

2023
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
LIKE THESE, WHEN THERE ARE AN

2024
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
ESTIMATED 2 MILLION-PLUS GUNS
ALREADY IN CIRCULATION.

2025
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
NO EASY ANSWERS, JOSH.

2026
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
NO EASY ANSWERS.

2027
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
>> TO MAKE THE POINT, THEN, IF

2028
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
WE STOPPED GUN PRODUCTION IN THE

2029
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
COUNTRY TODAY, WE COULD STILL BE

2030
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
YEARS AND YEARS AWAY FROM A

2031
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
SOLUTION ON THAT TASK.

2032
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
>> GUNS ARE NOT BIO DEGRADABLE.

2033
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000
THEY'RE NOT GOING AWAY.

2034
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
THE COUNTRY HAS TO FIGURE OUT

2035
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
HOW TO DEAL WITH THE MENTAL

2036
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
HEALTH ISSUES AND THE GUNS

2037
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
ALREADY ON THE STREET.

2038
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
>> STAGGERING NUMBERS.

2039
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
THANK YOU, PIERRE.

2040
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000

LIKELY TO KICK UP POWERFUL

2046
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
THUNDERSTORMS.

2047
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
THE POSSIBILITY IN THE RED ZONE

2048
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:47,000
OF ONE OR TWO SCATTERED
TORNADOES.

2049

2051
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,000
BIRMINGHAM, TALLAHASSEE, YOU'RE
LIKELY TO SEE THE MOST POWERFUL

2052
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
STORMS COME OUT OF THIS.

2053
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000

COUNTRY.

2056
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
IT WILL BRING IN MUCH COOLER
AIR.

2057
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
WE HAVE BLIZZARD CONDITIONS

2058
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
GOING ON IN THE CASCADES RIGHT

2059
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
NOW.

2060
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
THIS IS COLD AIR AND EVEN THE
POSSIBILITY OF SNOW.

2061
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
WATCH THE TEMPERATURE GO DOWN.

2062
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000

THIS IS REALLY GOING TO MAKE AN

2069
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
IMPACT ON THE COLD AIR MOVING

2070
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

2071
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
A QUICK LOOK AT THE BIG BOARD.

2072

NORTHWEST IS LIKELY TO BE A

01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
SNOWMAKER FROM DENVER TO CHICAGO

01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
A CONVERSATION WITH THE

>>> AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE, THE

2091
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
SHATTERED COMMUNITY IS TURNING

2092
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
TO RELIGIOUS LEADERS FOR COMFORT

2093
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
AS THEY STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND

2094
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

2095
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I'M JOINED BY THREE OF THOSE

2096
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
LEADERS.

REVEREND MATT, BISHOP RED

THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

MATT, LET ME BEGIN WITH ROW.

2101
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I WAS STRUCK BY YOUR OPENING

2102
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
WORDS.
AT THE INTERFAITH SERVICE LAST

2103
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
NIGHT WHEN YOU TOLD EVERYONE,

2104
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
NOT ONLY HERE IN NEWTOWN BUT

2105
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WE NEEDED

2106
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
THIS.
>> MM-HMM.

2107
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
YES, I THINK IT WAS CLEAR TO US

2108
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
AS CLERGY AND CLEAR AS PART OF

2109
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
ALL OUR TRADITIONS THAT OF THE

2110
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,000
IMPORTANCE OF GATHERING TOGETHER

2111
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
TO GRIEVE.

2112
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
AND THAT THERE IS -- THERE IS

2113
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
THAT NEEDED CONNECTION WITH

2114
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
OTHER PEOPLE.

2115
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
WHO ARE IN THE MIDST OF TRYING

2116
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
TO COME TO TERMS WITH THINGS

2117
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:09,000
THAT ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO

2118
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
DOM TE
COME TO TERMS WITH.

2119
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
>> WE COULD FEEL THE PAIN IN THE

2120
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
ROOM.
HEARD THE SOBS.

2121
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
RABBI, YOU HAVE HAD TO DEAL

2122
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
DIRECTLY WITH FAMILY WHO LOST A

2123
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
LITTLE BOY, NOAH POZNER IN THE

2124
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
FIRST GRADE.
YOU HAVE A VERY STRIKING PHRASE

2125
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
TO DESCRIBE WHAT YOU TRIED TO

2126
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
BRING TO THE FAMILY.

2127
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
SPIRITUAL MORPHINE.

2128
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
>> THERE'S PAIN IN THE BODY AND

2129
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
PAIN OF THE SOUL.

2130
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
THIS IS REALLY PAINFUL.

2131
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
FAMILIES JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

2132
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
DO WITH THEMSELVES.

2133
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
YOU KNOW.

2134
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
THEY WANT --

2135
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
>> WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY TELL

2136
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
THEM?

2137
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
>> YOU HAVE TO SEE WHAT

2138
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
RESONATES WITH THE PERSON.

2139
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
EVERYBODY IS DIFFERENT.

2140
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,000
THE POZNERS APPRECIATED THE

2141
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
THEOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF IT.

2142
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,000
BASICALLY, WHAT I ASKED

2143
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,000
VERONIQUE IS WHERE IS YOUR

2144
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
6-YEAR-OLD?

2145
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:11,000
SHE SAID, WHAT YOU  WHAT DO YOU?

2146
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
SHE SAI

2147
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I SAID, WHERE IS YOUR

2148
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
6-YEAR-OLD?
SHE SAID, WHAT?

2149
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:24,000
>> SAID DID YOUR 6-YEAR-OLD DIE?

2150
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
SHE SAID NO, IT'S WITHIN ME.

2151
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
LIKE THAT RUSSIAN DOLL.

2152
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,000
IT WAS SOMETHING SHE COULD HOLD

2153
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
TO THAT WAS LOGICAL.

2154
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,000
>> BISHOP, WE'VE BEEN SO

2155
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000
IMPRESSED BY YOUR CONGREGANT,

2156
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,000
ROBBIE PARKER, WHO LOST HIS

2157
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
DAUGHTER, EMILIE, PESPEAKING ABT

2158
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,000
HER, SHARING THE LOVE THEY HAD

2159
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
TOGETHER.

2160
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:58,000
>> YEAH, ROBBIE IS JUST

2161
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
NATURALLY THAT WAY.

2162
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,000
HE ES SPOUSES THE TEACHINGS OF

2163
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
JESUS CHRIST.

2164
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
THAT'S ALLOWED HIM TO SHOW LOVE

2165
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
FOR HIS FAMILY AND THOSE AROUND

2166
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
HIM.
>> REACHING OUT IN WHAT MUST

2167
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
HAVE BEEN THE HARDEST THING IN

2168
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
THE WORLD.

2169
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
REACHING OUT TO THE FAMILY OF

2170
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
THE SHOOTER.

2171
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
>> HE KNOWS THAT IF HE ALLOWS

2172
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
HATE TO ENTER HIS HEART, THERE'S

2173
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
NO ROOM FOR LIGHT AND LOVE AND

2174
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000

THAT'S JUST NOT WHO HE IS.

2177
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
ADMIRABLE THING.

2178
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000

2179
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000

2180
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:42,000
>> WELL, I THINK -- EACH FAMILY,

2181
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
EACH PARENT, EACH INDIVIDUAL IS

2182
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
GOING TO RESPOND DIFFERENTLY IN

2183
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
THE MIDST OF THEIR GRIEF.

2184
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
I THINK WE HAVE TO ALLOW PEOPLE

2185
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
TO FEEL THEIR ANGER AND NOT TO

2186
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
KIND OF JUST SAY, NO, YOU CAN'T

2187
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
FEEL THAT.

2188
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,000
I THINK WE DO UNDERGIRD THEM,

2189
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
FOR US, AS CHRISTIANS, THE

2190
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,000
TEACHINGS OF JESUS CHRIST ABOUT

2191
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:07,000
HOW WE LOVE OUR ENEMIES, EVEN

2192
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,000
THOSE WHO PERSECUTE US.

2193
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
WE DON'T SAY THAT'S HOW YOUR

2194
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
IMMEDIATELY GOING TO RESPOND.

2195
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
THAT PUTTING TOGETHER MAY TAKE A

2196
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
LIFETIME FOR SOME PEOPLE.

2197
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
WE DON'T JUST IMPOSE THAT ON THE

2198
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,000
GRIEF PROCESS.

2199
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
THERE ARE FOLKS, EXPERIENCING

2200
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
THAT, IS A TESTIMONY OF A SPIRIT

2201
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
OF FOLKS THAT CAN DO THAT.

2202
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
IT DOESN'T MEAN EVERYBODY IS

2203
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
ABLE TO DO THAT IN THAT MOMENT.

2204
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:38,000

I CAN IMAGINE A PARENT SAYING

THERE IS NO WAY A GOOD AND

2208
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
LOVING GOD COULD ALLOW THIS.

2209
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
THEREFORE, GOD MUST NOT EXIST.

2210
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,000
HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH FAMILIES

2211
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
STRUGGLING WITH THEIR FAITH?

2212
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,000
>> THIS IS NOT AN ACT OF GOD.

2213
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
THIS IS AN ACT OF MAN.

2214
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,000
IF WE HAVE FREE WILL, THERE'S

2215
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACT BADLY.

2216
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I HEARD FROM FRIEND WHO IS GREW

2217
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000

2218
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
WAS BULLIED IN SCHOOL A GREAT

2219

DEAL.

2220
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
AND THAT DOESN'T EXCUSE HIM.

2221
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I'M JUST TALKING BECAUSE I DO

2222
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
