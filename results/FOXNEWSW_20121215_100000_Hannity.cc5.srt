MILD AUTISM.

ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE BUT

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
REMOTE.
MOST OF THE VICTIMS VERY

265
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
DIFFERENT.
CHILDREN RANGING IN AGE 5 TO

266
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000

THE MOST DEFENSELESS THAT WALK

267

AMONG US.

268
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000

EMOTIONS OF THE NEWS.

278
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
SPOKE OF THE LANDMARKS IN

VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES

281
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
WERE ROBBED OF ALONG WITH THE

282
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
INNOCENCE TAKEN TOO EARLY FROM

283
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
THOSE WHO SURVIVED.

284
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
WE HAVE ENDURED TOO MANY OF

285
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
THESE TRAGEDIES IN THE PAST

286
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
FEW YEARS HE SAID AND EACH

287
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
TIME I LEARN THE NEWS I REACT

288
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
NOT AS A PRESIDENT BUT AS

289
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
ANYBODY ELSE WOULD AS A

290
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000

MEANINGFUL ACTION TO ADDRESS

294
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
THESE KINDS OF INCIDENTS BUT

295
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
HE OFFERED NO SPECIFICS.

296
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
FLAGS AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND

297
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
THE CAPITOL BUILDING ARE

SPORTS WORLD, MOMENTS OF

301
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
SILENCE WAS OBSERVED.

302
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
IT IS AND WILL BE A BITTER

303
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000

SCHOOL TRAGEDY IN CONNECTICUT.

312
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
>> COMING UP NEXT, A CHILD

313
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
PSYCHOLOGIST JOINS US AFTER
THE BREAK WITH A LOOK AT WHAT

314
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
COULD HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH

315
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
THE MINDS OF THOSE CHILDREN

316
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
TRAPPED INSIDE THAT SCHOOL AS

317
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
THE MASSACRE UNFOLDED.

318
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

319
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
>> IN MY MIND I'M THINKING AS

320
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
A 6-YEAR-OLD, 7-YEAR-OLD, WHAT
ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

321
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'M THINKING THAT I HAVE TO

322
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
PARENT.

323
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I HAVE TO TELL THEM.
I SAID TO THEM I NEED YOU TO

324
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU ALL VERY

325
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
MUCH AND THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

326
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
OKAY.
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE

327
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
LAST THING THEY WERE EVER

328
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
GOING TO HEAR.
>> THAT TEACHER KATELYN ROIG

329
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
PROTECTED THOSE STUDENTS BY

330
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
LOCKING THEM IN A BATHROOM AND

331
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
TELLING THEM TO BE AS QUIET AS

332
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
POSSIBLE.

333
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
AUGUST THE WHILE THEY COULD

334
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
HEAR GUNSHOTS ON THE OTHER

335
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
SIDE OF THE DOOR.

336
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
DID THEY REALIZE WHAT WAS

337
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
HAPPENING AND WHAT ABOUT THE

338
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
OLDER KIDS.

339
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
WE ARE JOINED BY DR. JENNY

340
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
KLEIN.

341
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> MY PLEASURE.

342
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
>> YOU HAVE THE TEACHERS

343
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
TRYING TO STAY CALM.

344
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THEY ARE

345
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
VERY EMOTIONAL AS WELL.

346
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
EVEN THE YOUNGER KIDS WHO

347
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO

348
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
COMPREHEND THE SPECIFICS OF

349
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

350
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
THEY ARE FEELING THAT EMOTION.

351
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY.

352
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
KIDS HAVE ARE EITHER MAD,

353
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
SCARED, SAID OR HAPPY.

354
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
THEY HAVE ENORMOUS IMAGINATION

355
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
FOR POWER WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE

356
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
ANY.

357
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
>> THAT'S INTERESTING YOU SAY

358
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
THAT BECAUSE ONE TEACHER WAS

359
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
TELLING HER YOUNGER KIDS THERE

360
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
IS A BAD GUY OUTSIDE.

361
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
WE HAVE TO STAY VERY QUIET

362
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
INSIDE.
AND ONE OF THE KIDS SAID OH I

363
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
KNOW KARATE, IT'S OKAY.

364
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I WILL LEAD US ALL OUT OF

365
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
HERE.
>> THAT'S THE IMAGINATION

366
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
BEFORE POWER TO PROTECT.

367
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE IT AND

368
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
THEN THEY HATE THEMSELVES.

369
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
AND THERE IS NO TIME IN THE

370
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
MIND SO THEY WILL BURY THAT

371
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
EXPERIENCE.
>> AS THE TEACHERS AND THE

372
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
OTHER STAFF WERE TRYING TO

373
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
PROTECT THESE KIDS, THEY DON'T

374
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
WANT TO CONVEY JUST HOW

375
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
HORRIFIC THIS SITUATION IS BUT

376
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS VERY

377
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
IMPORTANT THAT THEY CONVEY

378
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
SOME SENSE OF DANGER SO THAT

379
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
THE KIDS TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.

380
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
HOW DO YOU WALK THAT LINE?

381
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
>> WELL, IT'S REALLY --

382
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
CHILDREN WILL FEELINGS AND

383
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
EXPRESSIONS ON THEIR FACES HOW

384
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
SERIOUS IT IS AND FROM THEIR

385
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
OWN FEAR THEY WILL KNOW IT IS

386
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
VERY SERIOUS.
>> SO THEY CAN SENSE THE FEAR?

387
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
>> TEACHERS ARE SCARED AND
THEY ARE BIG PEOPLE SO IT MUST

388
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
BE SERIOUS.

389
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
>> REPORTS THAT THE PRINCIPAL

390
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
TURNED ON THE INTERCOM IN

391
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
ORDER TO WARN EVERYBODY THAT

392
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
THIS WAS UNFOLDING.

393
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
CREDITED FOR SAVING LIVES FOR

394
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
DOING THAT AT THE SAME TIME

395
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
THIS MEANT THAT THESE STUDENTS

396
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
HEARD SCREAMS IN ADDITION TO

397
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
THE GUNSHOTS.

398
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
HOW WOULD THEY BE PROCESSING

399
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
THAT?

400
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
>> WELL, THEY WILL HEAR THEM

401
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
AND THEY WILL BE IN THEIR MIND

402
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
FOREVER BECAUSE THERE IS NO

403
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
TIME IN THE MIND.

404
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
SO WHENEVER THEY ARE 44 AND

405
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
THEY HEAR A SCREAM, THEY WILL

406
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
GO BACK TO WHEN THEY WERE VERY

407
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
LITTLE AND BRING UP THE FEAR

408
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
AND THE TERROR.

409
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

410
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
MIND.

411
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
THERE IS NO TIME IN THE MIND
AT ALL.

412
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
>> YEAH.

413
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
SO YOU HAVE GOT KIDS IN THE

414
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
SCHOOL RANGING FROM

415
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
KINDERGARTEN UP TO FOURTH

416
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
GRADE.
OBVIOUSLY A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

417
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
HOW A 5-YEAR-OLD PROCESSES

418
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
THIS VERSUS A 10-YEAR-OLD.

419
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
ONE OF THE 3RD GRADERS SAID

420
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO

421
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
THROW UP.

422
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
VERY AFRAID AND MUCH MORE REAL

423
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
FOR THEM.

424
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
HOW WOULD THE OLDER KIDS BE

425
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
PROCESSING THIS?
>> WELL, THEY WILL PROCESS

426
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
THEIR FEELINGS AND THEY WILL

427
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
USE A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR

428
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
LOGIC SO TO SPEAK.

429
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
WHATEVER IS IN THEIR

430
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
IMAGINATION FOR THE -- TO FILL

431
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
IN THE POWER THEY NEVER HAD

432
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
WHEN THEY WERE SMALL BECAUSE

433
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
THEY CREATE THAT IS GOING TO

434
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
COME DOWN AND BLAME THEMSELF

435
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO DO

436
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
ANYTHING.
>> YOU ARE SAYING THAT THEY

437
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE

438
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
FEELING A GUILT AFTERWARDS?

439
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
>> YES.
WE ALL IMAGINE A SELF-WITH

440
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
INFINITE POWER LOCK, MOMMY,

441
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
CAN I FLY.

442
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
AND THEN IT DESSENDS INTO OUR

443
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
UNCONSCIENCE MIND 90% OF YOUR

444
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
BRAIN AND THE SPEED OF

445
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
PROCESSING THAT IS ENORMOUS

446
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
MORE SO THAN YOUR CONSCIENCE

447
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
MIND WHICH IS 10% OF YOUR

448
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
BRAIN.

449
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
WHAT HAPPENS IS SOMETHING

450
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
HAPPENS MANY YEARS LATER AND

451
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
IN TWO SECONDS, IT TRIGGERS

452
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
THAT FEAR AND THAT MEMORY AND

453
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
THAT SELF-HATE FOR BEING

454
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
POWERLESS AS OPPOSED TO THE

455
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
INFINITE POWER I WISH I HAD

456
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
THEN.
AND I DIDN'T.

457
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
>> SO, THEY HAVE GOT YEARS

458
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
AHEAD OF THEM OF HOPEFULLY

459
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
GETTING HELP AND PROCESSING

460
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
THIS AND FORGIVING THEMSELVES

461
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
AND MOVING ON.

462
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
>> MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO

463
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
TEACH PEOPLE HOW THEIR MIND

464
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
WORKS.
WE NOW HOW OUR COMPUTER WORKS

465
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THE

466
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
HARD DRIVE OF OUR MIND

467
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
COLLECTS EVERYTHING WE HAVE

468
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
EVER EXPERIENCED AND IT

469
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
COMPARES US TO THE REALITY OF

470
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
OUR POWER, WHICH IS MUCH LESS.

471
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
THAT'S WHERE SELF-HATE GETS

472
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
STORED INSIDE AND COMES OUT

473
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
LIKE THIS KILLER IN KILLING

474
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
HIS MOTHER AND THEN KILLING

475
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
THE KIDS IN HER CLASS.

476
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
AND THEN KILLING HER KID WHICH

477
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
IS HIMSELF.

478
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
>> WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE

479
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000

PERHAPS HE HAD SOME SORT OF AS

541
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
BERGER'S OR EVEN WAS DIAGNOSED

542
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000

NOW, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO --

543
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I JUST WANT TO GET THIS OUT,

544
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
WE ARE NOT SAYING THAT AUTISM

545
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
CAUSES THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR.

546
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
THE FACT THAT HE WAS A LOANER,

547
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
HE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN ANY

548
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
SOCIAL INTERACTION.

549
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
CAN'T KEEP A REAL

550
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
CONVERSATION.
WHEN THEY TALK TO A LOT OF HIS

551
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
FRIENDS THEY FOUND OUT HE WAS

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000

555
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
20-YEAR-OLD?

559
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
>> EXACTLY RIGHT.

560
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
NOW WE ARE SEEING MORE AND

561
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
MORE OF THESE PEOPLE COMING TO

562
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
MOVIE THEATERS AND COMING TO

563
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
SCHOOLS AND GO ON RAMPAGE AND

564
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
START KILLING PEOPLE THERE IS

565
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
A DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEM WITH

566
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
THEIR BRAIN AND THEY DON'T

567
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
TREAT PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, THEY

568
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
TREAT THEM LIKE AN OBJECT.

569
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
SO FOR HIM TO SHOOT HIS MOM,

570
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
COME TO SCHOOL AND START

571
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
SHOOTING ALL THESE KIDS, THERE

572
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
IS OBVIOUSLY HE DOESN'T

573
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
PROCESS THE INFORMATION THE

574
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
SAME WAY THAT YOU AND I DO.

575
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
HE MAY NOT LOOKING AT THE KIDS

576
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
AS A PERSON.

577
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
SO THESE ARE THE VERY

578
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
DIFFICULT ISSUES THAT HAS TO

579
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
BE DEALT WITH EARLY ON AND

580
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
MAYBE SEEK HELP BEFORE WE SEE

581
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
THIS KIND OF TRAGEDY.

582
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
>> YOU FEEL THERE MAY HAVE

583
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
BEEN SIGNS LEADING UP TO THIS,

584
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
SOME SIGNS THAT OTHER PEOPLE

585
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
MIGHT HAVE NOTICED.

586
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
>> IF YOU REALLY GO BACK AND

587
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
START ASKING A LOT OF PEOPLE

588
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
THAT WERE AROUND HIM, THERE IS

589
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
ALWAYS SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF

590
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
THIS KID REALLY HAVING

591
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR.

592
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
NOT WITH IT, TOTALLY DIFFERENT

593
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
AND SO, YES, IT'S ALWAYS

594
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
THERE.
WE MAY OR MAY NOT PAY

595
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
ATTENTION BECAUSE SOMETIMES
YOU MAY FEEL SORRY OR, YOU

596
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
KNOW, THERE ARE ALWAYS.

597
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
>> AT 20 YEARS OLD HE IS AN

598
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
ADULT.
THE LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY

599
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
PRO-INDIVIDUAL.
DIFFICULT FOR A FAMILY TO TRY

600
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
TO FORCE ANY KIND OF TREATMENT

601
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
UPON SOMEBODY.
>> YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

602
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I THINK CATCHING THIS EARLY ON

603
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
BEFORE THEY GET TO THAT AGE IS

604
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL.
I THINK AS A COUNTRY WE ARE

605
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
GOING THROUGH A VERY TOUGH

606
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
TIME.
I HOPE WE DON'T SEE MORE AND

607
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
MORE OF THESE ISSUES.

608
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
BUT AS THE PRESSURE, WHETHER

609
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
IT'S ECONOMIC OR FAMILY ISSUES

610
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
AND OTHER CASES LIKE THIS MAY

611
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
BECOME MORE APPARENT.

612
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I THINK SPENDING TIME WITH THE

613
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
FAMILY, CATCHING THEM EARLY,

614
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
DIAGNOSING THEM EARLY IS THE

615
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
WAY TO GO.
>> JUST BRIEFLY WE ARE HEARING

616
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
ABOUT THESE WHITE MIDDLE CLASS

617
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
YOUNG MEN WHO ARE DOING.

618
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
THIS WHAT DOES THAT TELL US?

619
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
>> I DON'T THINK THAT, YOU

620
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
KNOW, THERE IS ANYTHING --

621
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
WHETHER THEY ARE WHITE OR NOT.

622
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I THINK JUST OVERALL, YOU

623
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
KNOW, LOOKING AT TEENAGERS

624
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
LIKE THIS, THEY ARE GOING

625
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
THROUGH A VERY TOUGH TIME.

626
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I DON'T WANT TO JUDGE THIS AT

627
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
THIS POINT.

628
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I THINK IT'S EARLY ON IN THE

629
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
INVESTIGATION.

630
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
WE NEED TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE

631
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING

632
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
ON.

633
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
SO, AS A STORY DEVELOPS AND WE

634
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
FIND OUT MORE WE WILL GET TO

635
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000

>> JAMES ROSEN, THANK YOU.

928
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> CERTAINLY HARD FOR ANY

929
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
PARENT OUT THERE TO IMAGINE

930
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
WHAT THE FATHERS AND THE

931
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
MOTHERS OF THE VICTIMS OF

932
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
CONNECTICUT ARE GOING THROUGH

933
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
RIGHT NOW.
BUT OUR NEXT GUEST UNDERSTANDS

934
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
OUR PAIN ALL TOO WELL.

935
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
>> BETH IS HER NAME.

936
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
HER DAUGHTER RACHEL JOY SCOTT

937
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
DIED IN THE COLUMBINE

938
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
SHOOTING.
HER SON CRAIG WITNESSED THAT

939
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
TRAGEDY AND MANAGED TO

940
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
SURVIVOR.
GOOD MORNING THEIR, BETH.

941
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I KNOW THE COLUMBINE SHOOTING

942
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
WAS 13 YEARS AGO BUT I IMAGINE

943
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
THIS BRINGS UP A WHOLE LOT OF

944
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
EMOTIONS FOR YOUR FAMILY.

945
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
>> OH, IT DID.

946
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
YESTERDAY WAS LIKE RELIVING

947
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
APRIL 20TH, 99 ALL OVER AGAIN.

948
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
SO MUCH PAIN WITH YOU MY FIRST

949
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
REACTION WAS I WAS ANGRY.

950
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I WAS VERY ANGRY THAT THIS

951
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN, ESPECIALLY

952
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
TO LITTLE CHILDREN, LITTLE

953
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
BABIES.

954
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
AND JUST ANGRY THAT THAT

955
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
SOMEONE WOULD TAKE OUT THEIR

956
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
FRUSTRATION AND THEIR ANGER

957
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
AND THEIR PAIN ON SOMEONE SO

958
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
INNOCENT.
>> AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT WE

959
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
WOULD HAVE LEARNED THE SIGNS

960
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
BY NOW TO LOOK OUT FOR IN

961
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
TROUBLED YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN

962
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
AND SADLY AT LEAST IT APPEARS

963
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE.

964
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
>> I HEARD THE FAMILY OF

965
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
ANOTHER COLUMBINE FAMILY SAY

966
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
THIS JUST YESTERDAY.

967
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
THAT WAS THAT THE REALLY

968
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
DIFFICULT PHASE ACTUALLY

969
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
BEGINS FOR THOSE FAMILIES

970
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
RIGHT NOW.

971
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
COULD YOU TALK TO US A LITTLE

972
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
BIT ABOUT THAT?

973
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
>> SURE.

974
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
IT'S SO UNREAL WHAT THEY ARE

975
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
EXPERIENCING NOW IS SO UNREAL.

976
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
IT'S LIKE BEING HIT BY A

977
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
FREIGHT TRAIN BUT YOU'RE

978
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
LIVING WITH THE PAIN AND THE

979
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
LOSS AND THE GRIEF.

980
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
AND YOU ARE JUST NUMB INSIDE.

981
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
SO IT COMES AND GOES.

982
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
THE WEEPING, THE DISBELIEF,

983
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
THE DENIAL, ALL OF THOSE

984
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
THINGS ARE SO IN YOUR FACE AT

985
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
THIS POINT IN TIME.

986
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
THERE IS IS NO WAY TO ESCAPE

987
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
IT THERE IS NO PLACE TO GO TO

988
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
HIDE.
AND I REMEMBER FEELING LIKE I

989
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
JUST WANTED TO DIE.

990
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I COULDN'T BREATHE.

991
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I MEAN THERE WERE TIMES WHERE

992
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I FELT LIKE I COULDN'T

993
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
BREATHE.

994
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
>> BETH, HOW ABOUT YOUR SON?

995
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
YOUR SON MANAGED TO SURVIVE

996
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
THAT DAY.

997
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
HOW DID YOU HELP HIM GET

998
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
THROUGH IT.
>> CRAIG WAS IN BAD SHAPE FOR

999
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
ALMOST TWO YEARS.

1000
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
AND I QUIT MY FULL-TIME JOB

1001
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
AND WORKED AT HOME AND TOOK

1002
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
CARE OF HIM.

1003
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
HE BECAME MY PRIORITY.

1004
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I WAS AFRAID I WAS GOING TO

1005
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
HAVE TWO COLUMBINE VICTIMS

1006
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE
AN EMOTIONAL CRIPPLE AND HE

1007
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
WASN'T PHYSICALLY DAMAGED BUT

1008
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
WHAT HE WITNESSED WAS TWO

1009
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
FRIENDS DYING AND SEEING

1010
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
EVERYTHING AND THE CARNAGE OF

1011
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
THAT LIBRARY WHERE 10 CHILDREN

1012
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
PERISHED THAT DAY WAS TOO MUCH

1013
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
FOR HIM.
SO IT TOOK HIM ALMOST TWO

1014
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
YEARS TO BECOME, YOU KNOW,

1015
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
HIMSELF AGAIN.

1016
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
>> CERTAINLY AFFECTING YOUR

1017
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
SON, YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY AND SO

1018
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FOR

1019
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
THEIR LIFETIME.

1020
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
BUT I'M HAPPY TO TELL FOLKS

1022
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
HAPPINESS AGAIN.

1023
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
IT TOOK A LONG TIME BUT YOU

1024
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
WERE ABLE TO FIND THAT

1025
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
HAPPINESS.

1026
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
BETH, THANK YOU SO MUCH, SORRY

1027
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000

SCHOOL?
SO WHAT CAN SCHOOLS DO TO

1035
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
PROTECT CHILDREN?

1036
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
LET'S TALK NOW WITH A FORMER

1037
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
DETECTIVE AND NEW JERSEY

1038
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
POLICE COMMISSIONER STEPHAN

1039
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
WRONGERS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

1040
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
US.

1041
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
>> GOOD MORNING.
>> PRIVATE SECURITY FIRMS SAY

1042
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
THEY ARE ALREADY FIELDING

1043
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
.ALLS FROM SCHOOLS IN THE WAKE

1044
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
WHAT TYPE OF SECURITY IS

1045
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
APPROPRIATE AT A SCHOOL?

1046
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
>> LET ME SHARE THIS WITH YOU

1047
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
THAT POLICE AND TEACHERS

1048
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
AROUND THIS NATION ARE TRAINED

1049
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
FOR INCIDENTS LIKE THIS.

1050
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO ADMIT TO

1051
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
YOUNER HAVE ANY ONE OF US IN

1052
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT OR TEACHERS

1053
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
ACROSSED THE COUNTRY BELIEVED

1054
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
WE WOULD BE FACING SOMETHING

1055
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
LIKE THIS.

1056
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
SCHOOLS ACROSS THE DISTRICT

1057
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
ARE, IN FACT, DOING THE BEST

1058
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
THEY COULD.

1059
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
THEY PUT CAMERAS UP.

1060
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
THEY PUT METAL DETECTORS UP.

1061
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO

1062
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
PREVENT INCIDENTS LIKE THIS.

1063
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
THE BOTTOM LINE REGARDING THIS

1064
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
INCIDENT AS REPORTS COME OUT

1065
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE UNABLE

1066
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
TO PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE

1067
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
THIS.

1068
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
THE GUY HAD THESE GUNS.

1069
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I UNDERSTAND HE SHOT HIS WAY

1070
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
THROUGH THE DOOR.

1071
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE

1072
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
TO PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS

1073
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
FROM HAPPENING, BUT SOMETIMES

1074
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
YOU CAN'T DO VERY MUCH AS IN A

1075
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
CASE LIKE THIS.

1076
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
>> THIS SCHOOL HAD A BUZZER.

1077
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
AT FIRST THEY WERE SPECULATING

1078
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
THAT HE WAS BUZZED IN BECAUSE

1079
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
HE IS KNOWN TO THE SCHOOL.

1080
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
HIS MOTHER WORKS THERE AS A

1081
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
SUBSTITUTE TEACHER.

1082
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
SOMETHING LIKE A.

1083
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
[ BUZZER BUZZER

1084
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
INEFFECTIVE.
SOMEBODY BUZZES THEY LET THEM

1085
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
ON IN.

1086
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
BUT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO TURN

1087
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
THE SCHOOL INTO AN ARMED

1088
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
PRISON ALMOST BY HAVING METAL

1089
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
DETECTORS AND SECURITY GUARDS.

1090
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1091
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TO SCHOOL

1092
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
DISTRICTS WHERE NOW HERE I'M

1093
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
AN ELECTED OFFICIAL IN NUTTILY

1094
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
AND EVEN IN OUR HIGH SCHOOL

1095
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
WHEN I WALK IN I'M GREETED BY

1096
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
AN INDIVIDUAL.

1097
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
THEY TAKE ME TO THE OFFICE.

1098
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I SIGN IN.

1099
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
SO EVERYONE WHO WALKS IN THAT

1100
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
BUILDING IS CHECKED OUT.

1101
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
NOW, YOU ARE RIGHT.

1102
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
DO YOU WANT YOUR SCHOOLS TO BE

1103
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
ARMED CAMPS?

1104
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
BUT I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO

1105
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
FOCUS ON IN THIS CASE AND

1106
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
OTHER CASES.

1107
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
THE POLICE AND THE TEACHERS

1108
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO

1109
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
PREVENT MORE TRAGEDY.

1110
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
THEY DID A SUBURB JOB.

1111
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
MOVING FORWARD WE HAVE TO

1112
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
BELIEVE WE DID THE BEST THICK

1113
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
WE DID IN THIS CASE AND

1114
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
HOPEFULLY AS TIME GOES ON WE

1115
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
CAN ASSESS EACH INCIDENT AND

1116
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
MAYBE STRENGTHEN OUR SECURITY

1117
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
IN CERTAIN AREAS.

1118
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
AGAIN, YOU CAN ONLY DO SO

1119
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000

TRAGEDY.
SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.

1127
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
WHAT ARE DETECTIVES LOOKING TO

1128
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
LEARN FROM THE CRIME SCENE?

1129

THE SCHOOLS.

1134
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
TWO PRONOUNCED DEAD AT AREA

1135

AT THE SCHOOL.

1138
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
AS THE GOVERNOR HAS REPORTED,

1139
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
THE SHOOTER IS DECEASED.

1140
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
DECEASED IN THE SCHOOL.

1141
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
>> IT IS EXPECTED TO TAKE DAYS

1142
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
FOR INVESTIGATORS TO PROCESS

1143
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
THE GRUESOME CRIME SCENE AT

1144
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
THE SCHOOL.

DR. MICHAEL BODIEN IS HERE TO

1148
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
EXPLAIN WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING
FOR AND WHAT THEY HOPE TO

1149
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
LEARN FROM IT THANK YOU FOR

1150
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
JOINING US, DOCTOR.

1151
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
THE GUNMAN HERE IS DEAD.

1152
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
>> RIGHT.
>> NOT LIKE THEY ARE BUILDING

1153
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
A CASE FOR A TRIAL OR NEED

1154
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
EVIDENCE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

1155
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
HAPPENED.
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BUT WHAT

1156
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
ARE THEY LOOKING FOR?

1157
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
>> WELL, YOU ARE RIGHT.

1158
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
WHY -- WE KNOW WHAT THE CAUSE

1159
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
OF DEATH ARE AND WE KNOW THAT

1160
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
THE SHOOTER IS DEAD.

1161
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
BUT THERE MAY BE A LOT OF

1162
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
CIVIL TRIALS AS TO PROTECTION

1163
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
OF THE CHILD, AS TO PROTECTION

1164
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
OF THE CHILDREN.

1165
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
WHY WASN'T THIS 20-YEAR-OLD

1166
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
KID PICKED UP EARLIER?

1167
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
IF HE WAS GETTING MEDICATION,

1168
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
COULD THE MEDICATION HELP

1169
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
TRIGGER OFF MORE AGGRESSION?

1170
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
THERE WILL BE CIVIL LAWSUITS

1171
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
AND THERE MAY BE SOMEBODY WHO

1172
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
IS CONNECTED TO THIS WHO WILL

1173
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
ALSO BE CHARGED CRIMINALLY IF

1174
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE WHO

1175
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
WORKED WITH ADAM.

1176
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

1177
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
THE POLICE ARE LOOKING INTO.

1178
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS THAT

1179
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
THEY ARE ASSESSING ALL OF THE

1180
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
FORENSIC EVIDENCE AT THE

1181
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
SCENE, TAKING PICTURES OF

1182
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
EVERYBODY, -- WORK AT THE

1183
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
SCENE BUT THEN THEY WILL WORK

1184
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
AT THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S

1185
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
OFFICE AND DOCUMENT EVERY

1186
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
INJURY AND PERHAPS DO

1187
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
AUTOPSIES ON THESE LITTLE

1188
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
CHILDREN BECAUSE ALL THE

1189
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
BULLETS HAVE TO BE REMOVED.

1190
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
ALL THE BULLETS WILL THEN BE

1191
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
CHECKED WITH THE TWO WEAPONS

1192
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
THAT YOU MENTIONED AND TO MAKE

1193
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
SURE THERE ISN'T A THIRD

1194
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
WEAPON, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS

1195
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
DISCHARGED.

1196
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
>> APPARENTLY THERE WAS A

1197
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
THIRD WEAPON IN THE CAR FROM

1198
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
WHAT WE ARE HEARING NOW

1199
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
ALTHOUGH AGAIN AS YOU SAY SO

1200
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
MANY QUESTIONS.
>> THERE WERE RUMORS OF TWO

1201
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
SHOOTERS WHICH PROBABLY

1202
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
DOESN'T EXIST.
>> RIGHT.
>> BUT THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE

1203
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
THAT SOMEBODY ELSE WASN'T

1204
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
DISCHARGING A WEAPON.

1205
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
>> YEAH.
SO PEOPLE ARE SHOKDZ AT THE

1206
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
DEATH TOLL HERE.

1207
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
9/11 A MASS SHOOTING LIKE

1208
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
THIS, YOU OFTEN HAVE MANY MORE

1209
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
INJURIES.

1210
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
NOT EVERYONE DIED.

1211
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
SOME PEOPLE SURVIVED.

1212
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
>> THAT'S VERY INTERESTING

1213
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
BECAUSE THIS SHOOTER MUST HAVE

1214
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
GONE TO EACH CHILD AND MADE

1215
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
SURE THAT THERE WAS A SHOOTING

1216
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
OF A VITAL ORGAN IN THE HEAD.

1217
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
INFORMATION THAT THEY WERE

1218
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
DEAD.
YOU ARE RIGHT.
USUALLY THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE

1219
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
WHO SURVIVE.

1220
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
INJURED BUT SURVIVED.

1221
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
HE MUST HAVE GONE AROUND TO

1222
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
EACH CHILD.

1223
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
AND ALL WITHIN A COUPLE

1224
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
MINUTES.
THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM.

1225
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
THESE WEAPONS CAN BE

1226
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
DISCHARGED VERY QUICKLY.

1227
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
AND HE HAD TO RELOAD.

1228
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
THOSE GUNS ONLY WOULD NORMALLY

1229
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
HOLD ONLY 12, UP TO 15

1230
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
BULLETS.

1231
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
SO HE WOULD HAVE -- THEY SAID

1232
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
THERE WERE 100 BULLETS FIRED.

1233
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET.

1234
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
THEY ARE FINDING THAT OUT.

1235
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
HE MAY HAVE HAD TO RELOAD ONE

1236
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
OR TWO TIMES.

1237
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
>> JUST A HORRIFIC STORY.

1238
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
>> AND JUST THE HELPLESSNESS.

1239
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I I AGREE VERY MUCH WITH YOUR

1240
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
PREVIOUS GUEST.
WHO SAID NO MATTER HOW GOOD WE

1241
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
ARE IF SOMEBODY BURSTS IN AND

1242
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
SHOOTS A LOT OF PEOPLE AND

1243
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
KILLS HIMSELF BY THE TIME HELP

1244
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
ARRIVES, IT'S ALL OVER.

1245
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
>> DR. MICHAEL BADEN, THANK

1246
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
YOU SO MUCH.

1247
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
>> THANK YOU.

1248
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
>> WHEN WE COME BACK, A SCHOOL

1249
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
PSYCHOLOGIST WILL TALK TO US

1250
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
ABOUT THE LONG-TERM EFFECT

1251
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
THIS WILL HAVE ON THE CHILDREN

1252
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
WHO SURVIVED THE MASSACRE.

1253
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
>> THERE WAS NOISE, THEY WERE

1254
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
KIND OF HUDDLED UP, THEY WERE

1255
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
EVACUATED.
I THINK, YOU KNOW, PROBABLY

1256
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
THE SCARIER PART FOR THEM WAS

1257
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
BEING TAKEN OUT OF A ROOM BY

1258
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
POLICE OFFICERS AND, YOU KNOW,

1259
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
THAT KIND OF THING, WITHDRAWN

1260
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
GUNS.
I THINK THAT WAS PROBABLY THE

1261
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
HARROWING MOMENT FOR THEM.

1262
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
AND THE PARENT REACTIONS, I

1263
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
MEAN, I DON'T KNOW SOME KIDS

1264
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
OBVIOUSLY SAW MORE AND

1265
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
THEREFORE THEY WERE MORE

1266
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
IMPACTED.

1267
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
>> CERTAINLY MANY OF US WILL

1268
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
NEVER FORGET THE DETAILS OF

1269
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
THAT TRAGEDY.

1270
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
YOUNG STUDENTS WHO WERE THERE

1271
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
AND MANAGED TO SURVIVE A LOT

1272
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
OF US ARE ASKING NOW WHAT WILL

1273
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
THEY REMEMBER AND HOW WILL

1274
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
THOSE CHILDREN PROCESS IT?

1275
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
WE ARE JOINED BY DR. THOMAS

1276
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
KIRSTEN A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST

1277
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
IN NEW JERSEY WHAT ARE THEY

1278
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
FACING LONG-TERM.

1279
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
>> ONE THING WE WILL SEE IS

1280
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER

1281
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

1282
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
>> EVEN A A-YEAR-OLD.

1283
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
>> DEFINITELY, WITHOUT

1284
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
QUESTION.
THIS IS IS TRAUMATIC LIFE

1285
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
INCIDENT THEY WILL CARRY NO

1286
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
DIFFERENT FROM A WAR VETERAN

1287
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
IN VIETNAM WHO IS HITTING THE

1288
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
DECK 20 YEARS LATER WHEN HE

1289
