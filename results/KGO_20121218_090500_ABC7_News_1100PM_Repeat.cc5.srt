JOIN THE HEATED DISCUSSION ON

729
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
OUR FAN PAGE AND WE'RE GOING TO

730
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
READ YOUR RESPONSES ON THE AIR.

731
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
AS SHE JUST ALLUDED TO THAT

732
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN WAS FROM

733
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
1994 TO 2004.

734
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LONG-TERM

735
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
EFFECTS, THEY SAID THERE WAS NO

736
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
CHANGE, MAYBE A SMALL DECREASE

737
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
IN THE MASS SHOOTINGS, BUT

738
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
OVERALL, NOT A DECREASE IN

739
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
VIOLENCE.

740
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
>> THE JURY IS OUT.

741
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
YESTERDAY, ACCORDING TO A 2004

742
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA STUDY

743
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
ABOUT THE BAN, THE NUMBER OF

744
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
PEOPLE KILLED IN MASS SHOOTINGS

745
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
DID GO DOWN IN THE YEARS THE BAN

746
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
WAS IN EFFECT EXCEPT FOR '99.

747
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
THAT WAS COLUMBINE, AS WE ALL
REMEMBER.

748
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
BUT BECAUSE MASS SHOOTINGS ARE

749
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
RELATIVELY RARE, IT'S DIFFICULT

750
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
TO TELL WHETHER THIS WAS CAUSED

751
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
BY THE BAN.

752
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS GIVEN A LOT OF
LIP SERVICE TO GUN CONTROL

753
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
BECAUSE OF THE NATIONAL OUTRAGE.

754
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
BUT THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO HAS

755
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
BEEN MUCH MORE FRIENDLY TO GUN

756
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
OWNERS THAN GUN CONTROL

757
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
ADVOCATES.

758
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
HE ALLOWED GUNS ON AMTRAK TRAINS

759
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
AND ALLOWED GUNS IN NATIONAL

760
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
PARKS.

761
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
HE GAVE LIP SERVICE TO GETTING
THIS BAN BACK IN EFFECT.

762
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
SO YOU HAVE TO WONDER NOW

763
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
BECAUSE THE TONE OF THE COUNTRY

764
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
BECAUSE OF SANDY HOOK WHETHER HE

765
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
WILL ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING OR
NOT.

766
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
BUT THIS HAS NOT BEEN ON HIS

767
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
AGENDA HIS FIRST TERM.
>> THAT ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN,

768
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
THERE WERE A LOT OF LOOPHOLES.

769
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
MAYBE THERE WON'T BE AS MANY

770
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
LOOPHOLES.

771
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
>>> MOVE ALONG, THE SANDY HOOK

772
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
TRAGEDY HAS HIM ON A MISSION TO

773
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
GET MORE GUNS OFF THE STREETS,

774
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
STEVEN BARTON WAS IN

775
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
COLORADO WHEN HE WAS SHOT DURING

776
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
THE MOVIE THEATER MASSACRE.

777
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
HE HAPPENS TO LIVE IN

778
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
CONNECTICUT JUST A FEW MILES

779
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
FROM NEWTOWN AND HE'S HOPING THE

780
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
SCHOOL SHOOTING WILL BRING ABOUT

781
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
CHANGE.

782
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
>> OUR COUNTRY IS LONG OVERDUE

783
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
FOR A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT

784
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
GUNS
